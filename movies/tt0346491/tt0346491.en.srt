2
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:06,728
Alexander, the army will divide.

3
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,981
Satrapies will revolt.
Without your orders, there'll be war.

4
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,650
We beg you. Tell us who.

5
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,504
Our world is gone now.

6
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:19,133
I'm the last left alive.

7
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,180
Whether that's a blessing or a curse...

8
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,641
...who by Hades would know.

9
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:32,230
But I've paid my price...

10
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,106
...in blood.

11
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:39,487
And in broken dreams.

12
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:46,494
They say we were the greatest
fighting force ever known to man.

13
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:53,334
Greater even than the expedition to Troy.

14
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,337
But how can I say it?

15
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,507
How can I tell you what it is like
to be young...

16
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:03,177
...and to dream big dreams?

17
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:08,182
To believe when Alexander looked you
in the eye, you could do anything.

18
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,017
Anything.

19
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:18,693
In his presence, by the light of Apollo,
we were better than ourselves.

20
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:25,783
Truly, I've known many great men
in my life...

21
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,870
...but only one colossus.

22
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,581
And only now, when old...

23
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:36,794
...do I understand
who this force of nature really was.

24
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,050
Or do I?

25
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:48,556
Did such a man as Alexander exist?
Of course not.

26
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:52,059
We idolize him,
make him better than he was.

27
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:56,898
Men, all men, reach and fall...

28
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,401
...reach and fall.

29
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:12,079
In the East, the vast Persian Empire
ruled almost all the known world.

30
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:17,668
In the West,
the once great Greek city-states...

31
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:22,924
...Thebes, Athens, Sparta,
had fallen from pride.

32
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:27,929
For 100 years now, the Persian kings
had bribed the Greeks...

33
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,098
...with their gold
to fight as mercenaries.

34
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:36,604
It was Philip, the one-eyed,
who changed all this...

35
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:41,609
...uniting tribes of illiterate sheepherders
from the high and lowlands.

36
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:45,947
With his blood and guts,
he built a professional army...

37
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,951
...that brought the devious Greeks
to their knees.

38
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,579
He then turned his eye on Persia...

39
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:57,667
...where it was said the
Great King Darius himself...

40
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,921
...on his throne in Babylon,
feared Philip.

41
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,386
Philip was murdered...

42
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:12,640
...much to Persia's delight and
perhaps sponsored by their gold.

43
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:17,979
And Alexander, at 20,
became the new ruler of Macedonia.

44
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,940
Announcing revenge
for the death of Philip...

45
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:25,111
...Alexander liberated
all of the cities of western Asia...

46
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,822
...south to Egypt...

47
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:32,034
...where he was declared
Pharaoh of Egypt...

48
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,662
...and worshipped as a god.

49
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,627
And finally, he provoked
the rise to battle...

50
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:47,842
...in the heart of the Persian Empire,
near Babylon.

51
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:58,853
It was mad.

52
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,522
Forty thousand of us against
hundreds of thousands...

53
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,358
...of barbarian races unknown to us...

54
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,987
...gathered under Darius himself.

55
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,324
East and west had now come together...

56
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:16,037
...to decide the fate of the known world.

57
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:22,418
It was the day Alexander
had waited for all his life.

58
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,088
Son of a god.

59
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,341
It was a myth, of course.

60
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,303
At least it started as a myth.

61
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,388
I know.

62
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,974
I was there.

63
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:41,312
In the crack of the Persian line,
we'll go for the head.

64
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,272
Kill Darius?

65
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,609
The gods have brought him
to us at last.

66
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,862
If I die, it's one Macedonian.

67
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,783
But the Persians, they cannot move
without Darius' command.

68
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,287
Here. Right here, we cut the throat
of the Persian army.

69
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,749
This is madness. You'll never get
within 100 paces of him.

70
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,918
Have you seen the sheer size
of his force?

71
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:08,589
Not if you hold them on the left,
my brave Parmenion...

72
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:13,177
...with your son Philotas
for just one, two hours tomorrow.

73
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:19,391
And you, unbreakable Antigonus,
the center phalanx.

74
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,687
Perdiccas, Leonnatus...

75
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:27,775
...Nearchus, Polyperchon.

76
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:32,071
If you pin them on the walls
of your sarissas, here in the center...

77
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,199
...their cavalry will follow me
out to the right.

78
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:38,869
And when bold Cassander breaks,
stretching their left...

79
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,914
...a hole will open.
Then I and my cavalry...

80
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,458
Our revered Cleitus...

81
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,878
...Ptolemy and Hephaistion.

82
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,089
- Will strike through that gap...

83
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:53,634
...and deal the deathblow
to Darius' head.

84
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:58,305
Since when, by the light of Apollo, has
cavalry been used to break an infantry line?

85
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,474
What was it we did to
Chaeronea, Parmenion?

86
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:04,478
Alexander, even with luck, timing, the gods,
they're at least five to our one...

87
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:08,732
...which means in truth we must rout them
tomorrow, destroy their army completely.

88
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,444
Or we'll be picked apart by bandit tribes
on the long journey home.

89
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,655
Right.

90
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:19,243
You speak of home and retreat...

91
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:22,246
...but do you understand, Parmenion?

92
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,041
Babylon's my new home.

93
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,629
Alexander...

94
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,048
...if we must fight...

95
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,009
...do so with stealth.

96
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:40,139
Use your numbers well. We should attack
tonight when they least expect us.

97
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:53,819
I didn't cross Asia
to steal this victory, Cassander.

98
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,698
No, you are too honorable for that.

99
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:01,493
No doubt influenced from sleeping
with Tales of Troy under your pillow.

100
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:06,373
But your father
was no lover of Homer's.

101
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:10,544
The lands west of the Euphrates, Alexander,
the hand of his daughter in marriage.

102
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,796
Since when has a Greek
been given such honors?

103
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:17,134
There are not honors, Parmenion,
they're bribes...

104
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,095
...which the Greeks
have accepted too long.

105
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:25,643
Do you forget that
the man who murdered my father...

106
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,354
...lies across the valley floor?
- Come, Alexander...

107
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,358
...we're still not really sure if it was
Persian gold behind the assassination.

108
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,568
But that is no matter!

109
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:38,739
Your father taught you never to surrender
your reason to your passion.

110
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,741
Now I urge you...

111
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,953
...with all my experience, regroup.

112
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,288
Fall back to the coast,
raise a larger force.

113
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,085
I would, if I were Parmenion.

114
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:54,421
But I am Alexander.

115
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:58,342
And no more than Earth has two suns
will Asia bear two kings.

116
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,511
These are my terms.

117
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:05,224
And if Darius isn't a coward
who hides behind his men...

118
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,518
...then he'll come to me tomorrow.

119
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:11,772
And when he bows down to Greece...

120
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,484
...Alexander will be merciful.

121
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:25,911
By Ares' chains, he has got balls, men.

122
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,914
I mean, give the man his due,
Parmenion.

123
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:36,463
And, lads, feast tonight,
for tomorrow we will dine in Hades.

124
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:49,643
I've seen one before.
It was still alive.

125
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,577
To whom do you pray?

126
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,664
Phobos.

127
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,500
Fear?

128
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,589
A bad omen.

129
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,968
More so for Darius.

130
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:34,521
I've come to believe the fear of death
drives all men, Hephaistion.

131
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,316
And this we didn't learn as schoolboys.

132
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,487
It is the cause of all of our misfortunes.

133
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,365
- So, mighty Crateros.
- Your Majesty.

134
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:48,494
- Are you ready for tomorrow?
- It's been too long coming if you ask me.

135
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:53,040
The men are skittish as colts and
the damn bulls won't shut their snouts.

136
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,710
Good. Fear makes men fight better.

137
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,880
Post your sentries alertly
but rest them well.

138
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:04,343
Don't you worry, general. I'm known to
sleep with my eyes open as a baby's arse.

139
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,596
Only because someone
might steal his loot, sire.

140
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,891
Well, someone owes Crateros
for his cheapness.

141
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:14,311
He buys neither gloves nor blankets
to warm himself.

142
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,231
Who needs gloves
when you come from grace?

143
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,234
Who needs clothes
when you can fight naked?

144
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,069
He's right.

145
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:25,114
After tomorrow, even the thrifty
among you shall be kings.

146
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,409
- The gods are with us, Your Majesty.
- We'll stain the ground...

147
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,577
...in Persian blood, my king.

148
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,206
You're on the first row tomorrow, boy.

149
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,378
I've always believed, Alexander...

150
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,756
...but this seems so much bigger than us.

151
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:47,594
Did Patroclus doubt Achilles when they
stood side by side at the seat of Troy?

152
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,596
Patroclus died first.

153
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,433
If you do...

154
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:56,979
If you were to fall, Hephaistion,
even if Macedonia were to lose a king...

155
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,898
...I will avenge you.

156
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,943
And follow you down
to the house of death.

157
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,280
I would do the same.

158
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:20,085
On the eve of battle,
it's hardest to be alone.

159
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,717
Then perhaps...

160
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,430
Perhaps this is farewell then...

161
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,641
...my Alexander.

162
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:40,731
Fear not, Hephaistion.
We are at the beginning.

163
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:19,353
Blood makes the world rise.

164
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:23,690
Blood makes the rain fall.

165
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:30,405
Blood makes the earth grow.

166
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:37,871
And in blood, all men are born and die.

167
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:45,379
Blood is the food of the gods below.

168
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:03,313
Come, Bucephalus.
Today we ride to our destiny.

169
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,903
Company, group! Regroup!

170
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:24,251
Phalanx, turn right!

171
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:46,064
Phalanx, attention!

172
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:10,297
Neoptolemus.

173
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:13,342
I remember you the day
you took the siege tower at Tyre.

174
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,803
You were a giant.
And today, how will you fight?

175
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:24,895
Dexippos, by Athena.

176
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:29,232
How far was it you threw your man
wrestling at the last Olympic Games?

177
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,069
Will you match it with your spear?

178
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:41,953
And Timander, son of Menander,
a great soldier to my father.

179
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:46,833
I still mourn your brother, Addaios,
who died so bravely at Halicarnassus.

180
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:50,629
What an honored family
you descend from, Timander.

181
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,715
You fight for them today.

182
00:18:55,176 --> 00:19:01,181
You've all honored
your country and your ancestors.

183
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:06,144
And now we come to this
most distant place in Asia...

184
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:12,943
...where across from us, Darius
has at last gathered a vast army...

185
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,763
But ask yourselves...

186
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:47,477
...who is this great king
who pays assassins in gold coins...

187
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,938
...to murder my father, our king...

188
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:54,943
...in a most despicable
and cowardly manner?

189
00:19:55,111 --> 00:20:00,741
Who is this great king, Darius,
who enslaves his own men to fight?

190
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:05,036
Who is this king but a king of air?

191
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,415
These men do not fight for their homes.

192
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:12,085
They fight because
this king tells them they must.

193
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:16,256
And when they fight,
they will melt away like the air...

194
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,468
...because they know no loyalty
to a king of slaves.

195
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:23,889
But we are not here today as slaves.

196
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,266
We are here today...

197
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:30,103
...as Macedonian freemen!

198
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,704
And though outnumbered...

199
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:52,584
...I say to you who know
the price of tyranny...

200
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:57,798
...who've carried the Persian yoke
too long...

201
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,302
...you have a strength
born of your hearts...

202
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,515
...and all their arms, their numbers...

203
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:10,143
...their chariots and all their fine horses...

204
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:13,146
...will mean nothing
in the hands of slaves.

205
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,524
Some of you...

206
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,611
...perhaps myself...

207
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:24,658
...will not live to see the sun set
over these mountains today.

208
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:30,455
For I will be
in the very thick of battle with you.

209
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,334
But remember this:

210
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,214
The greatest honor
a man can ever achieve...

211
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:44,636
...is to live with great courage
and to die with his countrymen...

212
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,639
...in battle for his home.

213
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,856
I say to you...

214
00:21:56,607 --> 00:22:00,527
...what every warrior has known
since the beginning of time.

215
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:03,071
Conquer your fear...

216
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,700
...and I promise you,
you will conquer death.

217
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,477
And someday I vow to you...

218
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:40,442
...your sons and your grandsons
will look into your eyes.

219
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:45,196
And when they ask why you
fought so bravely at Gaugamela...

220
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,908
...you will answer...

221
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:52,954
...with all the strength
of your great, great hearts:

222
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:56,082
"I was here this day at Gaugamela...

223
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,337
...for the freedom...

224
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:04,591
...and glory...

225
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,887
...of Greece!"

226
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:18,104
Zeus be with us!

227
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:48,677
Cassander! Four columns, go!

228
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,101
Where does he go?

229
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,603
I don't know, Majesty.

230
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,606
Envelop him, Bessus.

231
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:08,405
Hephaistion, go!

232
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,666
Phalanx!

233
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:41,438
He makes a mistake, Pharnakes.

234
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,151
Yes, great king.

235
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,257
Be brave, men.

236
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,843
Steady on the left, lads!

237
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:56,930
Bend if you must, but never break.

238
00:25:57,098 --> 00:26:00,100
And keep watching the cavalry on the left.

239
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,968
Pick up the pace!

240
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,481
Prepare to repel chariots!

241
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,353
Forward!

242
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,239
Cassander!

243
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,741
- Forward, men!
- Forward!

244
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:36,756
- Left turn!
- Infantry, clear! Out now!

245
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:50,747
Hold your positions!

246
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,736
Father! We must
fall back to the gully, Father.

247
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:23,446
No, hold.

248
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:27,533
Where is he? We're far too thin!
Get word to Alexander!

249
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,078
- Move!
- Yes, sir.

250
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:52,183
Come, Macedonians! Ride! Ride!

251
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:01,526
Drive for the hole!

252
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:05,071
- Drive for the hole!
- Drive for the hole!

253
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:41,858
Prince Merdicus, bring these men up.

254
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:10,511
Back and to the left!
Back and to the left!

255
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,806
- General!
- Get to your home! And go home fast.

256
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,684
I cannot see!

257
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:19,854
- Philotas! Philotas!
- Father.

258
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:22,106
Go. Tell Alexander yourself.

259
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:26,819
And if he won't listen, then survive me
and avenge this betrayal!

260
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:12,573
Pay attention, lad!
Your father still watches over you!

261
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:00,121
Darius!

262
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:02,498
Find your horses.

263
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,725
Darius!

264
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,373
Go! Go!

265
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:05,603
We can reach those mountains by sunset,
go all night and catch Darius at dawn.

266
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:08,648
Provision the horses.

267
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:13,027
Alexander!
Alexander, my father's lost.

268
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:15,988
They've overrun the flank.
They're into the baggage train.

269
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:18,324
Parmenion's crumbling.

270
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:23,079
Alexander, if you chase him,
you risk losing your army here.

271
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,498
And if we capture him,
we gain an empire.

272
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:38,344
You can run to the ends of the earth,
you coward...

273
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:41,430
...but you'll never run far enough!

274
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:44,308
To Parmenion!

275
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,340
You bleed free, my lord.

276
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:19,760
- May I tend to your wound?
- No, Hermolaus, not now.

277
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:22,388
There's far worse than me. Go to them.

278
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:24,390
Help them.

279
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:50,082
How was this done, soldier?

280
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:53,294
Spear.

281
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,714
But I got two of the buggers.

282
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,594
Your Majesty.

283
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,805
You're very brave.

284
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:07,975
What shall I call you?

285
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:11,020
- Glaukos, my king.
- Glaukos.

286
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:14,940
- And where's your home?
- Illyria.

287
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:20,029
Let your body go loose.

288
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:25,493
Think of home now.

289
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,120
Be brave again, Glaukos...

290
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,208
...and you will live on in glory.

291
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,463
Alexander.

292
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:51,560
The Persian Empire,
the greatest the world had yet known...

293
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:53,938
...was destroyed.

294
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:03,239
And Alexander, at 25,
was now king of all.

295
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:21,465
If you hesitate, she will strike.

296
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,178
Yes.

297
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:29,723
They are like people.

298
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:36,939
You can love them for years.
Feed them, nurture them...

299
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:42,528
...but still, they can turn on you.

300
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,496
Don't hurt her.

301
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,833
Good.

302
00:38:58,253 --> 00:38:59,712
Come.

303
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:07,887
He calls me a barbarian.

304
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,681
He makes a mockery
of Dionysus every night.

305
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:30,284
Some called his mother,
Queen Olympias, a sorceress...

306
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:33,913
...and said that Alexander
was the child of Zeus.

307
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,541
Others, Dionysus.

308
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:44,256
Women are the only ones
who know Dionysus.

309
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:58,437
But truly, there was not a man
in Macedonia who didn't look...

310
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:03,943
...at father and son, side by side,
and wonder.

311
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:19,375
My little Achilles.

312
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:43,899
Stay, Alexander, down. Down.

313
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:47,361
What is it you want?

314
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:49,405
Six months. Did you miss me?

315
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:53,117
- No. Not here!
- Proud bitch. I'm still your king.

316
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,453
King of what? Sheepherders?

317
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:06,005
- I am of Achilles' royal blood.
- The blood of Herakles runs in my veins.

318
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,841
- You are nothing but a drunken whore.
- Shut your mouth.

319
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:10,634
You 10-titted bitch from Hades!

320
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:13,804
Which god could I curse to
have ever laid eyes on you!

321
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:18,183
Do you think people respect you?

322
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:21,103
You think they don't know your bastards?

323
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:32,865
Damn your sorceress soul! You keep him
here like one of your snakes!

324
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:36,285
I told you not! I told you not.

325
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:39,204
- You'll obey me.
- I will not.

326
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:43,709
You'll obey me, or I'll kill you
with my own hands.

327
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:51,383
Let her go! No! Stop! Papa!

328
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:56,555
- Obey me!
- Your Majesty! No!

329
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:00,142
In the name of the gods.

330
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:05,522
He will never be yours! Never!

331
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:10,360
In my womb, I carried my avenger!

332
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:23,082
In the world he grew up to...

333
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:28,170
...I've come to believe it was in
friendship that Alexander found his sanity.

334
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:31,757
You don't need much to fight.

335
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:38,222
When you're in the front ranks of a battle,
facing some Northern barbarian tribe...

336
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:43,268
...courage won't be in
the soles of your feet, Perdiccas.

337
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:46,271
Or in the thickness
of your tunic, Philotas.

338
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:49,233
Or in the lining
of your stomach, Nearchus.

339
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,779
It's in the heart of a man.

340
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:58,992
You don't need to eat every day
or until you're full, Ptolemy.

341
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,121
You don't need to lie in bed
in a morning...

342
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:06,500
...when you can have some good bean soup,
Cassander, after a forced night march.

343
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,128
Come on, Alexander.

344
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,966
Where's your hunger
to twist Hephaistion's head off?

345
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,427
Is he stronger than you?
Then beat him another way.

346
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:23,142
Who will respect you as a king?
You think because of your father?

347
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:29,439
The first rule of war is to do what you
ask your men to do. No more, no less.

348
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:34,570
Good, Hephaistion. That's it.

349
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:39,283
Well done. Good wrestling, Hephaistion.
That's what I want.

350
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,826
Come, come, come.

351
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:42,911
You did well, but you lost.

352
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:48,458
Now, both of you, congratulate
the other. Go on.

353
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,712
Would you want me to let you win,
Alexander?

354
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:56,008
You're right.

355
00:43:56,176 --> 00:43:59,261
But I promise you, I will beat
you one day, Hephaistion.

356
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:10,522
It was said later that Alexander
was never defeated...

357
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,608
...except by Hephaistion's thighs.

358
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:15,319
Although an inferior race...

359
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:20,908
...the Persians control at least
four-fifths of the known world.

360
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,577
From Ethiopia and Egypt in the south...

361
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:26,288
...to Caucasus and the two inland seas
in the north...

362
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:30,959
Philip brought such as Aristotle from
Athens to educate our rough people.

363
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:35,714
They rule, and we sit around like frogs.

364
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,090
- Master?
- Yes?

365
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:38,550
- Master!
- Out with it!

366
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:41,553
- Why are the Persians so cruel?
- Oh, come on, Nearchus.

367
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43,722
That is not the subject for today,
Nearchus.

368
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:48,894
But it is true that the Oriental races
are known for their barbarity...

369
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:51,355
...and their slavish devotion
to their senses.

370
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:55,609
Which are so dull,
they castrate young boys...

371
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:58,570
...such as yourselves,
for their sexual pleasure.

372
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:04,743
Yes. Excess in all things
is the undoing of men.

373
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:06,870
That is why we Greeks are superior.

374
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:10,249
We practice control of our senses.

375
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,668
Moderation, we hope.

376
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,753
Then what of Achilles at Troy, master?

377
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:21,385
- Was he not excessive?
- Achilles simply lacks restraint.

378
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:25,305
He dominates others so completely that
even when he withdraws from battle...

379
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:28,767
...crazed with grief over
his dead lover, Patroclus...

380
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:34,022
...he seriously endangers his own army.
He is a deeply selfish man.

381
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:38,110
Would you say the love between Achilles
and Patroclus is a corrupting one?

382
00:45:39,279 --> 00:45:42,781
When men lie together in lust,
it is a surrender to the passions...

383
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:46,702
...and does nothing
for the excellence in us.

384
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:51,373
Nor does any other excess, Cassander,
jealousy among them.

385
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:56,920
But when men lie together, and knowledge
and virtue are passed between them...

386
00:45:57,088 --> 00:46:00,674
...that is pure and excellent.

387
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:05,053
When they compete to bring out the good,
the best in each other...

388
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:09,141
...this is the love between men that
can build a city-state...

389
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:11,810
...and lift us from our frog pond.

390
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:16,982
But can a man
love a woman equally, master?

391
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,817
A woman? Of course not.

392
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:21,611
A woman is a slave
to her passion, Hephaistion.

393
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,948
Oh, naturally there are exceptions,
and we must honor them.

394
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:29,161
Such as Pallas Athena,
goddess of wisdom and war.

395
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:33,665
But never forget, she is sprung not from
the loins of Zeus, but from his mind.

396
00:46:34,334 --> 00:46:37,461
Now, you think on all this,
my young frogs...

397
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:42,341
...for in you resides
the future of Greek civilization.

398
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:46,845
To strive for honor
is the highest purpose of all.

399
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:49,514
To rule over our baser emotions.

400
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:53,518
To follow reason,
the divine part in each of you.

401
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:55,020
Yes...

402
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:59,483
...to love excellence
is truly to love the gods.

403
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:03,320
Now, will you stop distracting me?

404
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:06,365
Back to geography
and things that we know.

405
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:12,120
Is it possible that the source
of Egypt's mighty River Nile...

406
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:15,957
...could rise in these distant
mountains of the outer earth?

407
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:22,130
If so, an experienced navigator
could find his way here...

408
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:27,052
...by this river east, down
into the great plains of India...

409
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:31,807
...out into the eastern ocean
at end of the world...

410
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:35,894
...and by this route up the Nile...

411
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:42,150
...back to Egypt, into the Middle Sea
and home to Greece.

412
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:45,904
Now, if only these frogs
could look outward...

413
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:50,075
...and act on their favored position
at the center...

414
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:52,327
...Greece could rule the world.

415
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:58,083
Why is it, master, in myth,
these lands you speak of are known?

416
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:04,589
India, where Herakles
and Dionysus traveled.

417
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:10,262
All these men who went east,
Theseus, Jason, Achilles, were victorious.

418
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:14,349
From generation to generation,
their stories have been passed on.

419
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:17,060
Why? Unless there was truth to them?

420
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:22,858
Tales of Amazons? Minotaurs, Gorgons,
Icarus flying into the sun? No, Alexander.

421
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:26,862
Only common people believe these tales,
as they believe most anything.

422
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:31,616
We are here precisely to educate
ourselves against such foolish passions.

423
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:36,913
But if we are superior to the Persians,
as you say, why do we not rule them?

424
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:42,043
It is... It has always been
our Greek dream to go east.

425
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,921
My father long wants it.

426
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:50,886
The East has a way of swallowing
men and their dreams.

427
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:57,100
But still, to think it's these myths
that lead us forward to the greatest glory...

428
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,644
...why is it wrong to act on them?

429
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:03,440
I can only warn you, not teach you.

430
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,694
Beware of what you dream for.

431
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:12,157
The gods have a way
of punishing such pride.

432
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:26,796
And growing more ambitious, Philip now
planned the invasion of Persia.

433
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:37,390
The best you can do, Cleitus? Back
to the phalanx with you, I'll ride him myself.

434
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,935
No one will ride that beast, Your Majesty.

435
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,103
Not with your leg.

436
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:45,190
He's been beaten far too often.

437
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:49,027
My noble king,
he's a high-spirited animal, yes.

438
00:49:49,195 --> 00:49:53,031
High-spirited and worthy
of Philip of Macedon.

439
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:55,367
For three and a half talents...

440
00:49:55,535 --> 00:49:58,203
...I couldn't make a profit
on him, but for you...

441
00:49:58,371 --> 00:50:01,122
Why would I want such a beast?
I already have a wife.

442
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:04,709
Do I seem so old?

443
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,885
Stay down, stay down.

444
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,018
Hold him. Hold him!

445
00:50:28,568 --> 00:50:32,862
A broken neck comes free. He's
too nervous for battle. Sell him for meat.

446
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:36,408
Buy him for me, Father. I'll ride him.

447
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,414
And if you don't?

448
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:46,209
- I'll pay for him myself.
- With what, your singing voice?

449
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:48,169
I'll pay you!

450
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:51,756
I tell you, that horse can't be ridden,
lad. His mind is broken.

451
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:57,679
He can be ridden. By me.

452
00:50:57,847 --> 00:51:00,599
If you can rule that horse,
I'll make him yours...

453
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,767
...at half the price.

454
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,978
That horse will kill him, Philip.

455
00:51:05,146 --> 00:51:07,439
- He'll break the boy in two.
- Will he?

456
00:51:07,607 --> 00:51:10,442
Perhaps she'll make
a musician out of him yet.

457
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,877
You don't like your shadow, do you?

458
00:51:29,045 --> 00:51:33,089
It's like a dark spirit coming up to get you.

459
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:37,135
Do you see? That's us.

460
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:41,014
It's just a trick of Apollo's.

461
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:45,644
He's the god of the sun.

462
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:53,234
But I'll show you how to outwit him,
you and me together.

463
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:06,539
The boy doesn't have the craft, Philip.
He could hurt himself.

464
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:11,127
He'll have to figure that out
for himself. It's time.

465
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:13,129
Good idea.

466
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:16,549
Indeed there are times, Philip,
when I wonder if he is your blood.

467
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:19,344
- I only worry that...
- What was that, Attalus?

468
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:20,804
Nothing.

469
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:25,934
I was just noticing how the people
like seeing you and Eurydice together.

470
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:31,064
You go, boy!

471
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:36,444
You ride that horse and by Zeus I say,
you can rule the world.

472
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,762
Bucephalus.

473
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:06,891
That's what I'll call you.
Strong and stubborn.

474
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:12,814
Bucephalus and Alexander.

475
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:17,944
Come now, let's ride together.

476
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:52,520
He's got some Titan in him yet.

477
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:57,317
Attalus! Cleitus! For Zeus' sake,
he beat you, man!

478
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:05,700
Now, Bucephalus, show them.

479
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:39,943
My son.

480
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,820
My son!

481
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:55,291
You remember Prometheus...

482
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:59,337
...who stole the secret of fire
and gave it to man.

483
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:02,173
It made Zeus so angry...

484
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:05,552
...he chained Prometheus
to a rock in the great Caucasus...

485
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:09,597
...and each day, his eagle pecked out
the poor man's liver.

486
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:14,894
Each night, it grew back again so that
it could be eaten the next day.

487
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,312
Miserable fate.

488
00:55:18,858 --> 00:55:23,778
Oedipus tore out his eyes
when he found out...

489
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:26,197
...he'd murdered his father...

490
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:30,869
...and married his mother.
Knowledge that came too late.

491
00:55:31,704 --> 00:55:33,121
Jason...

492
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:37,333
...he went east and brought back
the Golden Fleece...

493
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:40,712
...and married a barbarian wife, Medea.

494
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:45,341
Later, when he left her
for a younger wife...

495
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:49,470
...Medea slaughtered
their two children in vengeance.

496
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:04,444
My mother would never hurt me.

497
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:14,787
It's never easy to escape our mothers,
Alexander.

498
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:21,878
All your life, beware of women.
They're far more dangerous than men.

499
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:32,722
I'm sure you remember Achilles
from Tales of Troy.

500
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,391
- He's my favorite.
- Why?

501
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:39,812
Because he loved Patroclus
and avenged his death.

502
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:43,608
Because he lived without fear,
and slew Hector.

503
00:56:43,776 --> 00:56:45,443
Some say he was a hotheaded fool...

504
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:47,695
...who fought for himself
and not the Greeks.

505
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:51,449
But he was a hero, the greatest at Troy.

506
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:52,825
And his fate?

507
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:56,871
That he must die young
but with great glory.

508
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:59,082
Did he have a choice?

509
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:05,505
Oh, yes. He could have a long life,
but there would be no glory.

510
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:12,804
You dream of glory, Alexander.
Your mother encourages you.

511
00:57:12,972 --> 00:57:16,599
There's no glory without suffering,
and this she will not allow.

512
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,935
She makes you weak.

513
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,605
The gods have never
made it easy for man.

514
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:26,401
Look, Herakles.

515
00:57:28,112 --> 00:57:31,823
Even after he accomplished
his 12 labors...

516
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:38,913
...he was punished with madness,
slaughtered his three children.

517
00:57:39,748 --> 00:57:41,666
Poor Herakles.

518
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:45,503
Great Herakles.

519
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:47,964
All greatness comes from loss.

520
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:54,595
Even you, the gods will
one day judge harshly.

521
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,764
When I'm king like you, Father?

522
00:57:56,932 --> 00:58:00,727
Don't rush the day, boy. You risk all.

523
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:05,857
My father threw me into battle
before I knew how to fight.

524
00:58:06,025 --> 00:58:08,568
When I killed my first man, he said:

525
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:10,987
"Now you know."

526
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:15,700
I hated him then,
but I understand why now.

527
00:58:15,868 --> 00:58:18,161
A king isn't born, Alexander.

528
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:22,373
He's made by steel and by suffering.

529
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:27,587
A king must know
how to hurt those he loves.

530
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:33,885
It's lonely. Ask Herakles.

531
00:58:34,887 --> 00:58:38,556
Ask any of them. Fate is cruel.

532
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:45,271
No man or woman can be too powerful
or too beautiful without disaster befalling.

533
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:51,903
They laugh when you rise too high and
crush everything you've built with a whim.

534
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:56,574
What glory they give,
in the end, they take away.

535
00:58:57,576 --> 00:59:01,162
They make of us slaves.

536
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:21,140
Truth is in our hearts,
and none will tell you this but your father.

537
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:24,769
Men hate the gods.

538
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:30,316
The only reason we worship any of them
is because we fear worse.

539
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:32,860
What's worse?

540
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:34,904
The Titans.

541
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:37,782
If they were ever to be set free...

542
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:40,952
...it would be a darkness
such as we have never seen before.

543
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,329
Could they ever come back?

544
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,625
Can Zeus imprison the Titans forever
under Mount Olympus?

545
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:53,214
It's said that when Zeus burned them
to dust with his lightning bolt...

546
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:56,134
...they took the Titans' ashes
and, in a cold revenge...

547
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:58,845
...mixed it with those of mortal men.

548
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,555
Why?

549
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:06,936
Who knows these things?

550
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:10,481
One day, things will change.

551
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:13,776
Men will change.

552
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:17,155
But first, the gods must change.

553
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,913
But all this you'll forget, Alexander.

554
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:29,083
That's why we call them myths.

555
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,503
We can't bear to remember them.

556
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,338
I'll remember.

557
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:38,009
And one day, I'll be on walls like these.

558
01:00:46,018 --> 01:00:48,227
Alexander once said to me:

559
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:52,857
"We are most alone
when we are with the myths."

560
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:55,026
Phalanx!

561
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:59,155
And thus, it came to pass in a dream...

562
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:03,367
...as mythical to all Greeks
as Achilles defeating the Trojans.

563
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:07,288
At this one glorious moment in time...

564
01:01:07,456 --> 01:01:11,709
...Alexander was loved by all.

565
01:01:13,754 --> 01:01:18,341
But in the end, I believe Babylon
was a far easier mistress to enter...

566
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:21,302
...than she was to leave.

567
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:15,940
Sikander! Sikander!

568
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:45,386
Aristotle may have called them barbarians,
but he never saw Babylon.

569
01:02:45,554 --> 01:02:50,224
We have enough gold here to support
three generations of Macedonian armies.

570
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:53,352
And Macedonia would soon corrupt,
Cassander.

571
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:58,190
- Wealth in great quantities brings the crows.
- Not for the men who fought, I trust.

572
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:03,195
We'll pay them well, Antigonus,
but not as mercenaries for future services.

573
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:05,323
Now you sound like Philip.

574
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,825
Philip never saw Babylon.

575
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,494
No, he didn't, Hephaistion.

576
01:03:12,331 --> 01:03:14,332
- Hello!
- Hello!

577
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:18,169
Alexander, I know you think me
a stiff old sod...

578
01:03:18,337 --> 01:03:20,838
...but whatever our differences,
know this day...

579
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:24,550
...your father would be very proud of you.

580
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:28,054
Thank you, Parmenion.

581
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:33,351
I ask you to forgive me
my own anger, my pride.

582
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:35,644
They, too, blind me.

583
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:42,693
A magnificent mainland work
from the last century.

584
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:48,699
The golden age, Alexander. Worth much
to Athens and to our alliances.

585
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:51,035
Take back what is ours...

586
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,704
...but spare what belongs to the Persians.

587
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:03,130
Yes. We're the richest men
to walk the earth, my friends.

588
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:08,010
- Not if you keep giving it all away.
- The grandsons of goat herders...

589
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:11,764
...we now rule 2 million square miles.

590
01:04:13,225 --> 01:04:14,767
But...

591
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:21,023
None of you fear that this great fortune
may drive us all to destruction.

592
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:23,234
You overvalue us.

593
01:04:23,402 --> 01:04:27,071
For as long as Darius breathes,
he is the legitimate king of Asia...

594
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:29,573
...and I but the king of air.

595
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:34,829
But he has no power, Alexander.
He's lost in the mountains with no army.

596
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:38,416
As long as he's lost, Philotas,
he can be believed in.

597
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:41,877
Only when he's found will it be decided.

598
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,673
It seems you've already
made up your mind.

599
01:04:45,841 --> 01:04:48,759
We must finish what we failed
to do at Gaugamela.

600
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:50,803
We must hunt Darius down.

601
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:54,432
- That was not your father's mission.
- And I am not my father.

602
01:04:57,144 --> 01:04:59,603
Come on. Have you so quickly forgotten?

603
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:00,813
Fortune favors the bold.

604
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:08,612
No wonder Darius fled
when he had this to come back to.

605
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:12,366
One for every night of the year.

606
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:40,644
How will I go back to Lysimache
after this?

607
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:44,732
I advise you not to touch, Leonnatus.
Here, I'll take care of it for you.

608
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:06,003
Aristotle was perhaps prescient.

609
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:13,511
Do these images fool us with their beauty
and degrade our souls?

610
01:06:43,959 --> 01:06:47,461
Bagoas, great king. Darius' boy.

611
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:52,675
- Bagoas.
- Nicely gilded, Your Majesty.

612
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:58,222
Most successful. He was certainly
one of the great king's favorites.

613
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:04,019
How old? Is great well with the years.

614
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:10,025
What are you now, Bagoas?
Eighteen, 19?

615
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:13,404
- Where does he come from?
- The north, sire.

616
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:17,324
From the hills near Susa.

617
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:19,535
You speak our language.

618
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:23,330
- Good. I'd like to learn yours.
- Is learnable, my lord.

619
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:38,095
So tell me, Bagoas...

620
01:07:39,306 --> 01:07:42,600
...do my eyes betray me
or do you wish to be set free...

621
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:44,476
...to go back to your homeland?

622
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:51,400
All my family's long dead, great king.

623
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:55,279
With your permission, I will stay on.

624
01:07:58,283 --> 01:08:00,034
Very well then, Bagoas.

625
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:03,954
Ptolemy, administer this.

626
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:10,461
And that's the same of every person
in the harem, woman and eunuch.

627
01:08:10,629 --> 01:08:14,006
Whoever wishes to be sent home
to their families, let them.

628
01:08:14,341 --> 01:08:15,424
What?

629
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:19,053
Hear that, boys? Set them free!

630
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:56,340
Great King Alexander.

631
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:01,428
The princess of the thousand roses...

632
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:04,348
...and eldest daughter of the formerly
Great King Darius...

633
01:09:05,684 --> 01:09:07,726
...Stateira.

634
01:09:08,395 --> 01:09:09,937
Noble Alexander...

635
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:20,030
...I come to beg for the lives...

636
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:22,116
...of my sisters...

637
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:26,036
...my mother, my grandmother.

638
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:34,753
You are not wrong, Princess Stateira.

639
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:37,047
He, too, is Alexander.

640
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:42,094
Please.

641
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:46,807
I plead for my family's lives.

642
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:51,228
- Sell me as a slave, great king, but...
- Look now...

643
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:53,564
...in my eyes...

644
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:55,899
...princess...

645
01:09:57,902 --> 01:09:59,611
...and tell me...

646
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:02,239
...how would you like to be treated?

647
01:10:04,743 --> 01:10:06,869
As I am...

648
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,079
...a princess.

649
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,084
Then so be it.

650
01:10:15,837 --> 01:10:18,881
You and your family shall
be treated as my family.

651
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:24,720
You shall live in this palace
as long as you choose.

652
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:28,766
Have you any other requests for me,
my noble princess?

653
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:32,936
No.

654
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:36,940
Everything I wish...

655
01:10:37,108 --> 01:10:40,027
...I have requested.

656
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:42,780
You truly are...

657
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:44,281
...a queen.

658
01:10:51,206 --> 01:10:53,957
Yes, she would be
a perfect match for you...

659
01:10:54,626 --> 01:10:56,502
...but you do nothing.

660
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:00,297
Three months you've been in Babylon
and leave me in Pella...

661
01:11:00,465 --> 01:11:04,301
...at the mercy of your enemies,
of which you have many.

662
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:08,138
Antipater, accustomed now to the power
that you have given him.

663
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:10,933
I must watch him grow stronger.

664
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:23,153
I'm certain that he communicates secretly
with Parmenion, who is dangerous.

665
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:26,323
But beware, most of all,
of those closest to you.

666
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:27,991
They are like snakes...

667
01:11:29,077 --> 01:11:30,494
...and can be turned.

668
01:11:30,662 --> 01:11:32,287
General Crateros.

669
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:38,877
Cassander is Antipater's son.

670
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:43,674
Even Cleitus, your father's favorite...

671
01:11:43,842 --> 01:11:46,301
...and Ptolemy, your friend, yes.

672
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:48,679
But beware of men who think too much.

673
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:51,181
They blind themselves.

674
01:11:54,853 --> 01:11:57,187
Only Hephaistion do I leave out.

675
01:11:58,273 --> 01:12:00,858
But all of them you make rich...

676
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:06,864
...while your mother and yourself,
you leave in generous poverty.

677
01:12:07,699 --> 01:12:10,701
Why won't you ever believe me?

678
01:12:10,869 --> 01:12:16,540
It is only a dark mind like mine
that can know these secrets of the heart.

679
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:19,543
For they are dark, Alexander.

680
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:22,129
So dark.

681
01:12:22,297 --> 01:12:28,886
But in you, the son of Zeus,
lies the light of the world.

682
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:33,056
Your companions will be shadows
in the underworld...

683
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:37,561
...when you are a name living forever
in history as the most glorious...

684
01:12:37,729 --> 01:12:42,190
...shining light of youth, forever young,
forever inspiring.

685
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:45,903
Never will there be an Alexander like you.

686
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:48,822
Alexander the Great.

687
01:12:49,824 --> 01:12:53,368
Remember, bring me to Babylon
as you promised.

688
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:56,747
I can only help you, for they know
if they harm you...

689
01:12:56,915 --> 01:13:00,042
...they will face my wrath,
as Queen of Babylon.

690
01:13:02,629 --> 01:13:06,298
It's a high ransom she charges
for nine months' lodging in the womb.

691
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:08,467
Bring her, Alexander.

692
01:13:08,635 --> 01:13:11,595
- It'll give her such joy.
- Joy?

693
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:15,766
When I'm the cracked mirror
of her dreams?

694
01:13:18,269 --> 01:13:20,938
Stay with me tonight, Hephaistion.

695
01:13:27,487 --> 01:13:29,279
I'll take my own bath.

696
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,907
Thank you, Bagoas.

697
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:41,583
What bothers you?

698
01:13:43,586 --> 01:13:46,338
I see in her everything I fear.

699
01:13:47,966 --> 01:13:53,011
Yet I have no idea what it is, this fear.

700
01:13:57,725 --> 01:14:01,311
She was always so sure
I was born of Zeus.

701
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,981
Why, Hephaistion?

702
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:10,654
I think there are things
beyond our imagining...

703
01:14:11,406 --> 01:14:16,451
...like the lightning,
tales of strange conceptions.

704
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:19,830
I don't doubt it.

705
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:22,332
What is being told me?

706
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:26,420
What destiny do we...? Do I have?

707
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:33,552
Well, if I'm Patroclus, I die first.

708
01:14:33,845 --> 01:14:35,762
Then you, Achilles.

709
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:45,355
The generals are upset.

710
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:49,943
They question your obsession
with Darius.

711
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:53,280
They say it was never meant
for you to be king of Asia.

712
01:14:53,448 --> 01:14:54,990
Naturally.

713
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:59,494
They want only to return to their homes,
rich with gold. But I've seen the future.

714
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:02,956
I've seen it now 1000 times,
on 1000 faces.

715
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:05,250
These people want...

716
01:15:06,044 --> 01:15:08,295
Need change.

717
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:13,675
- Aristotle was wrong about them.
- How so?

718
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:15,969
Look at those we've conquered.

719
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:18,221
They leave their dead unburied.

720
01:15:18,389 --> 01:15:21,099
They smash their enemies' skulls
and drink them as dust.

721
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:23,560
They mate in public.

722
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:28,565
What can they think or sing or write
when none can read?

723
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:33,403
But as Alexander's army, they can go
where they never thought possible.

724
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:36,615
They can soldier or work in the cities.

725
01:15:36,783 --> 01:15:40,994
The Alexandrias,
from Egypt to the outer ocean.

726
01:15:41,496 --> 01:15:44,414
We could connect these lands,
Hephaistion...

727
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:45,791
...and the people.

728
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:51,421
Some say these Alexandrias have become
extensions of Alexander himself.

729
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:55,467
They draw people into the cities
to make slaves of them.

730
01:15:55,635 --> 01:16:00,013
But we freed them, Hephaistion, from
the Persia where everyone lived as slaves.

731
01:16:01,933 --> 01:16:05,185
To free the people of the world...

732
01:16:05,353 --> 01:16:09,940
...such would be beyond the glory
of Achilles, beyond Herakles...

733
01:16:10,108 --> 01:16:12,776
...a feat to rival Prometheus...

734
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:16,238
...who was always a friend to man.

735
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,782
Remember the fates of these heroes.

736
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:23,120
- They suffered greatly.
- We all suffer.

737
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:27,124
Your father, mine.

738
01:16:27,959 --> 01:16:30,001
They all came to the end of their time.

739
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:34,256
And in the end, when it's over,
all that matters is what you've done.

740
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:40,345
You once said,
"The fear of death drives all men."

741
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,639
Are there no other forces?

742
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:46,643
Is there not love in your life...

743
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:50,063
...Alexander?

744
01:16:53,818 --> 01:16:58,280
What would you do if you
ever reached the end of the world?

745
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:03,326
I'd turn back and conquer its opposite.

746
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:13,545
I wonder sometimes if it's not
your mother you run from.

747
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:18,300
So many years,
so many miles between you.

748
01:17:20,428 --> 01:17:22,429
What is it you fear?

749
01:17:23,848 --> 01:17:26,183
Who knows these things?

750
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:32,898
When I was a child, my mother thought
me divine. My father, weak.

751
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:38,069
Which am I, Hephaistion?

752
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:40,363
Weak or divine?

753
01:17:43,868 --> 01:17:45,785
All I know is...

754
01:17:45,953 --> 01:17:48,914
...I trust only you in this world.

755
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:51,041
I've missed you.

756
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:53,168
I need you.

757
01:17:55,213 --> 01:17:56,880
It is you I love, Hephaistion.

758
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:01,426
No other.

759
01:18:05,223 --> 01:18:08,099
You're everything I care for...

760
01:18:08,267 --> 01:18:11,937
...and by the sweet breath of Aphrodite...

761
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:15,565
...I’m so jealous of losing you
to this world you want.

762
01:18:16,067 --> 01:18:18,693
You'll never lose me, Hephaistion.

763
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:22,364
I'll be with you always.

764
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:25,075
Till the end.

765
01:18:38,339 --> 01:18:40,966
The campaign in the northeast of Persia...

766
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:46,263
...turned into a hard guerrilla war
of almost three years.

767
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:51,518
We chased Darius towards Bactria...

768
01:18:51,686 --> 01:18:54,479
...but missed taking him by hours.

769
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:00,110
He was dying when we found him, sire.

770
01:19:00,278 --> 01:19:02,153
He asked for water.

771
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:04,698
He drank and died.

772
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:16,084
The Great King Darius had been betrayed
by his own commanders.

773
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:46,156
Fully honoring his corpse...

774
01:19:46,324 --> 01:19:51,244
...Alexander hunted down
these commanders into unknown lands...

775
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:57,042
...crossing even beyond
the River Oxus into Sogdia.

776
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:05,342
We fought them as far as
the unknown steppes of Scythia...

777
01:20:06,344 --> 01:20:09,637
...where only legendary heroes
had once trod.

778
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:15,143
The surveyors told us we were now on
the borders of where Europe and Asia meet.

779
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:18,563
In fact, we were totally lost.

780
01:20:20,066 --> 01:20:23,068
Here, Alexander founded
his 10th Alexandria...

781
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:28,531
...and settled it with veterans, their women
and any who would dare the frontier life.

782
01:20:29,533 --> 01:20:32,535
Unable to accept defeat in any form...

783
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:37,040
...Alexander persisted in breaking
every tribe that resisted...

784
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:41,211
...until the day he received the head
of his last enemy who'd surrendered.

785
01:20:46,092 --> 01:20:50,720
For Alexander, there could be
no pretender to the throne of Asia...

786
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:56,226
...which now included all
of Sogdia and Bactria.

787
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:03,566
It was here that he made
one of his most mysterious decisions.

788
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:10,907
Ten years after his mother's insistence
he marry a Macedonian...

789
01:21:11,075 --> 01:21:13,076
Through our union...

790
01:21:13,244 --> 01:21:16,079
...Greek and barbarian...

791
01:21:16,247 --> 01:21:18,206
...may be reconciled in peace.

792
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:24,087
...the most powerful man in the world
took a girl of no political significance.

793
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:30,677
Why?

794
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:35,223
Some say it was for
alliance with the tribes.

795
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:39,269
Others, the desire for a successor.

796
01:21:41,772 --> 01:21:46,818
And yet others said
Alexander truly fell in love.

797
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:49,946
Who Roxane really was...

798
01:21:50,114 --> 01:21:55,910
...I doubt that any of us ever saw further
than the pools of those black eyes.

799
01:21:57,538 --> 01:22:00,248
On this glorious occasion...

800
01:22:01,876 --> 01:22:04,752
...I toast this great army
that has given so much.

801
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:09,007
And in honor of them, those of you
who set out with us seven long years ago...

802
01:22:09,175 --> 01:22:15,430
...I pronounce all your debts paid forthwith
from the royal treasury.

803
01:22:15,806 --> 01:22:17,056
Praise Alexander!

804
01:22:21,145 --> 01:22:23,229
And in honor of my bride...

805
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:29,319
...my beautiful bride...

806
01:22:29,487 --> 01:22:33,990
...we recognize the many women
who've shared the long road with us...

807
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:37,660
...and grant them dowries
befitting a proper marriage.

808
01:22:46,337 --> 01:22:49,130
And what about our boys?

809
01:22:49,298 --> 01:22:50,798
And lastly...

810
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:54,219
...lastly, the gods demand no less of us...

811
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:57,722
...that your children be given
a proper Greek education...

812
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:02,519
...and military training
under our protection...

813
01:23:02,686 --> 01:23:06,898
...so as to be the new soldiers
of our kingdom...

814
01:23:07,066 --> 01:23:09,526
...in Asia.

815
01:23:25,376 --> 01:23:30,880
Your father must be turning in his grave.
After all this time, a hill chief's daughter.

816
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:32,924
You call this
tribal wedding legitimate?

817
01:23:33,092 --> 01:23:35,885
Do you forget my father
took a barbarian as his queen?

818
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:38,888
Yes, but few would call it
a profoundly happy marriage.

819
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:43,309
But what's the point, Alexander?
She's your captive.

820
01:23:43,477 --> 01:23:45,353
Just take her as your concubine.

821
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:48,356
Because I want a son.
Damn you, Philotas.

822
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:54,320
Then half your nobles have sisters
who'd make fine Macedonian mothers.

823
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:57,240
To take an Asian as my queen,
not a captive...

824
01:23:57,408 --> 01:23:59,242
...is a sign of respect
for our subjects.

825
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:01,744
It will bring us together, unify us.

826
01:24:02,288 --> 01:24:04,414
Which is not to say I won't take
a Macedonian.

827
01:24:04,582 --> 01:24:07,875
As a second wife? You insult Macedonia.

828
01:24:08,627 --> 01:24:12,589
Never will our people
accept this girl's son as king.

829
01:24:12,923 --> 01:24:17,093
They'll be angry enough to find out their
husbands all have second wives in Barbaria.

830
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:18,595
Then they'll learn!

831
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:22,015
By Athena's justice, this girl has spirit.

832
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:24,434
She'll breed a brave son.

833
01:24:24,602 --> 01:24:26,394
Alexander!

834
01:24:26,937 --> 01:24:29,606
This is about the honor of our kingdom.

835
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:31,941
Exactly. What can be won, Alexander?

836
01:24:32,109 --> 01:24:35,612
We're in Asia to punish them
for their crimes. We've achieved that.

837
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:39,407
Seven years from home, now we drift
from one far region to another...

838
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:43,202
...chasing nomads and bandits
when Macedonia bleeds its manpower.

839
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:46,289
For what? To build roads in Asia?

840
01:24:46,457 --> 01:24:49,959
- To give these people cities?
- And now make an army of them?

841
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:53,463
To found cities and expand
our reach is not to drift.

842
01:24:53,631 --> 01:24:56,049
- What benefit to Macedon?
- It's far richer!

843
01:24:56,216 --> 01:24:58,468
- Look what you give them.
- With respect...

844
01:24:58,636 --> 01:25:02,305
...had you fought better at Gaugamela
when your flank was crumbling...

845
01:25:02,473 --> 01:25:05,808
- How dare you, Nearchus?!
- General Nearchus to you, boy.

846
01:25:05,976 --> 01:25:09,479
Alexander spread our flank too thin!
There was nothing my father...

847
01:25:09,647 --> 01:25:11,981
...or any of you could've done!
- Philotas!

848
01:25:17,988 --> 01:25:20,615
Alexander, I've known you
since you were born.

849
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:24,285
I supported you at your father's death.

850
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:27,330
At the very least, for Zeus' sake...

851
01:25:27,498 --> 01:25:30,458
...and in respect to the council
that chose you king...

852
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:32,752
...give us a Macedonian heir.

853
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:34,629
A Macedonian heir.

854
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:43,012
- You've been heard clearly.
- But...

855
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:48,726
Parmenion! After the wedding, take two
brigades to Babylon, where I look to you...

856
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:53,731
...and Antipater in Greece, to maintain
our empire and supply this expedition.

857
01:25:54,525 --> 01:25:56,609
I'll winter with my army at Marakand.

858
01:25:56,777 --> 01:26:00,863
I pray to Apollo you realize how far
you've turned from your father's path.

859
01:26:01,031 --> 01:26:03,700
Damn you, Parmenion,
by the gods and your Apollo.

860
01:26:03,867 --> 01:26:07,036
What was in my father's guts
wasn't overripe in reason like yours!

861
01:26:07,204 --> 01:26:11,165
He never lusted for war, Alexander,
or enjoyed it so.

862
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:16,587
He consulted his peers in council,
among equals, the Macedonian way.

863
01:26:16,755 --> 01:26:19,298
He didn't decide based
on his personal desires.

864
01:26:19,466 --> 01:26:22,885
I've taken us further
than my father ever dreamed.

865
01:26:23,053 --> 01:26:24,345
Old man...

866
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:26,889
...we're in new worlds.

867
01:26:27,891 --> 01:26:31,561
Alexander, be reasonable!

868
01:26:31,729 --> 01:26:34,147
Were they ever meant to be our equals?

869
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,190
Share our rewards?

870
01:26:36,358 --> 01:26:38,484
You remember what Aristotle said.

871
01:26:38,652 --> 01:26:39,986
An Asian?

872
01:26:40,154 --> 01:26:43,948
What would a vow mean to a race
that's never kept their word to a Greek?

873
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:46,200
- Aristotle be damned!
- Alexander!

874
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:47,869
By Zeus and all the gods...

875
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:52,165
...what makes you so much better
than them, Cassander?

876
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:56,878
Better than you really are.
In you and those like you is this.

877
01:26:58,172 --> 01:27:00,006
Alexander.

878
01:27:02,676 --> 01:27:07,388
What disturbs me most is not your lack
of respect for my judgment.

879
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:14,187
It's your contempt for a world
far older than ours.

880
01:27:46,804 --> 01:27:49,472
Five to any man
who bothers to kill me.

881
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:52,016
Have another drink, Cleitus.

882
01:27:52,643 --> 01:27:55,812
- Shouldn't you be bound to a king?
- Cleitus.

883
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:00,733
Alexander, you look weak
when you not accept these honors.

884
01:28:00,901 --> 01:28:02,985
I understand, my dear father...

885
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:06,864
...but it's against Greek ways.
- Then Greek ways are weak.

886
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:09,700
I still think she got the better of him
in this bargain.

887
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:13,079
My daughter, Roxane...

888
01:28:13,247 --> 01:28:15,331
...she shall make you good wife.

889
01:28:15,499 --> 01:28:17,875
She shall kill for you.

890
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:27,426
Lord Sikander, ruler of heaven...

891
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:30,680
...and earth.

892
01:28:36,603 --> 01:28:39,981
In honor of this great alliance...

893
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:45,403
...I, Oxyartes, offer you these great gifts.

894
01:28:45,571 --> 01:28:48,489
I would like to honor a toast
to you from my people.

895
01:28:54,538 --> 01:28:56,080
Good morning, sire.

896
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:18,895
We shall fight for you, Alexander.

897
01:29:19,730 --> 01:29:21,898
It shall be bloody.

898
01:29:23,734 --> 01:29:25,651
Who's the bear?

899
01:29:27,321 --> 01:29:29,030
Parmenion.

900
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:32,408
You've been in complete control
of your supply lines.

901
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:34,869
His pessimism is infectious.

902
01:29:35,287 --> 01:29:37,246
But he'll stay loyal...

903
01:29:38,999 --> 01:29:41,250
...as long as his son remains with us.

904
01:31:58,013 --> 01:31:59,305
Hey!

905
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:11,484
Her eyes tell me
she cares for you, Alexander.

906
01:32:13,737 --> 01:32:15,071
Perhaps too much.

907
01:32:19,409 --> 01:32:21,744
In the ways of my country...

908
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:25,915
...those who love too much
lose everything...

909
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:29,752
...and those who love with irony...

910
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:32,421
...last.

911
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:25,224
I found it in Egypt.

912
01:33:27,894 --> 01:33:30,312
The man who sold it said it came
from a time...

913
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:34,358
...when man worshipped sun and stars.

914
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:42,491
I'll always think of you...

915
01:33:43,243 --> 01:33:45,578
...as the sun, Alexander.

916
01:33:45,745 --> 01:33:49,790
And I pray your dream
will shine on all men.

917
01:33:58,717 --> 01:34:00,843
I wish you a son.

918
01:34:02,679 --> 01:34:05,055
You're a great man.

919
01:34:09,186 --> 01:34:12,438
Many will love you, Alexander,
but none so pure and deep...

920
01:34:29,331 --> 01:34:30,748
You...

921
01:34:30,916 --> 01:34:32,374
...love him?

922
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:44,553
He is Hephaistion.

923
01:35:04,157 --> 01:35:06,075
Thank you, Bagoas.

924
01:35:11,915 --> 01:35:13,582
Your boy?

925
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:17,253
There are many different ways
to love, Roxane.

926
01:35:17,796 --> 01:35:19,296
Come.

927
01:35:34,396 --> 01:35:35,646
No.

928
01:35:35,814 --> 01:35:37,231
No, no.

929
01:35:53,123 --> 01:35:54,957
No. No.

930
01:36:27,532 --> 01:36:29,491
You have no fear.

931
01:36:31,161 --> 01:36:32,953
It's fitting.

932
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:37,666
A man searches for a woman
at Earth's top...

933
01:36:37,834 --> 01:36:39,835
...and finds her.

934
01:36:57,187 --> 01:36:58,854
The myth becomes real.

935
01:37:10,075 --> 01:37:13,994
Great man, Sikander...

936
01:37:14,329 --> 01:37:15,788
...you I kill now.

937
01:37:21,544 --> 01:37:23,045
Do it.

938
01:37:23,588 --> 01:37:26,131
End it. I would do the...

939
01:37:26,716 --> 01:37:30,761
I would do the same.
I'll die a fool...

940
01:37:30,929 --> 01:37:34,390
...for this love.

941
01:38:21,771 --> 01:38:23,689
My life is now yours.

942
01:38:48,506 --> 01:38:51,758
You will have my son.

943
01:39:46,814 --> 01:39:53,362
Who is this woman you call your queen,
Alexander? A hill girl?

944
01:39:54,197 --> 01:39:56,657
You with your breeding.

945
01:39:56,824 --> 01:40:01,870
Already she makes enemies
with her strong, clumsy nature.

946
01:40:05,208 --> 01:40:07,543
Do not confuse us.

947
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:11,505
I was never a barbarian as Philip said.

948
01:40:11,673 --> 01:40:14,341
We are of Achilles' royal blood.

949
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:18,303
Zeus is your father.

950
01:40:19,889 --> 01:40:24,309
Oh, I understand she brings
you some happiness...

951
01:40:25,061 --> 01:40:27,396
...but how can she help you?

952
01:40:27,564 --> 01:40:30,566
You must know that
she does not speak in your name...

953
01:40:30,733 --> 01:40:34,736
...which is yours and yours alone.

954
01:40:34,904 --> 01:40:37,948
Preserve it, secret it...

955
01:40:38,116 --> 01:40:41,243
...and hear me when I tell you,
act...

956
01:40:41,411 --> 01:40:43,328
...and act soon.

957
01:40:43,496 --> 01:40:45,497
After seven years, people wonder:

958
01:40:45,665 --> 01:40:47,958
"Who is this King Alexander?"

959
01:40:48,126 --> 01:40:53,922
I have given you ample proof.
Antipater daily undermines your authority.

960
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:57,092
Return to Babylon
and strengthen your center.

961
01:40:58,011 --> 01:41:00,095
Or come home to Macedonia
and reorganize.

962
01:41:00,263 --> 01:41:02,848
But do not chase your dream...

963
01:41:03,016 --> 01:41:05,100
...further east.

964
01:41:05,268 --> 01:41:09,062
Your life and mine depend on it.

965
01:41:09,939 --> 01:41:11,607
Remember...

966
01:41:11,774 --> 01:41:15,485
...my only thoughts are of you.

967
01:41:15,653 --> 01:41:19,948
As you, too, must face
your glorious destiny.

968
01:41:20,116 --> 01:41:22,242
Think kindly of your mother.

969
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:23,952
Provide for me.

970
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:27,748
Protect me from your enemies
when you are gone.

971
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:31,835
And remember always...

972
01:41:32,003 --> 01:41:35,464
...it is I who love you more than any.

973
01:41:41,721 --> 01:41:45,057
If only you were not a pale reflection...

974
01:41:45,224 --> 01:41:46,642
...of my mother's heart.

975
01:42:06,663 --> 01:42:10,165
Pregnant so soon. The little whore.

976
01:42:10,333 --> 01:42:14,503
He will marry her in the spring,
during Dionysus' Festival...

977
01:42:14,671 --> 01:42:17,297
...and when her first son is born...

978
01:42:17,465 --> 01:42:22,969
...her sweet uncle Attalus will convince
Philip to name the boy his successor...

979
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:25,555
...with himself as regent.

980
01:42:25,723 --> 01:42:27,683
And you...

981
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:31,937
...you will be sent on
some impossible mission...

982
01:42:32,105 --> 01:42:34,690
...against some monstrous Northern tribe...

983
01:42:34,857 --> 01:42:40,362
...to be mutilated in one more
meaningless battle over cattle.

984
01:42:40,530 --> 01:42:44,366
And I, no longer queen,
will be put to death...

985
01:42:44,534 --> 01:42:48,620
...with your sister and the remaining
members of our family.

986
01:42:48,788 --> 01:42:53,542
I wish sometimes you could see
the light, Mother.

987
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:58,463
The truth is, he's taken nothing from you
that you've not been long without.

988
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:02,384
The only way is to strike.

989
01:43:02,552 --> 01:43:05,345
Announce your marriage
to a Macedonian now.

990
01:43:05,888 --> 01:43:10,183
Beget a child of pure blood. He would
be one of them, not mine...

991
01:43:10,351 --> 01:43:13,687
...and he would have no choice
but to make you king.

992
01:43:13,855 --> 01:43:16,064
There is still Kynnane.

993
01:43:17,817 --> 01:43:21,695
Eurydice was perfect. If your father,
that pig, had not ravaged her first!

994
01:43:21,863 --> 01:43:24,656
Say nothing more of my father.

995
01:43:24,824 --> 01:43:27,826
Do you hear me? Say nothing.

996
01:43:28,745 --> 01:43:30,412
You're right.

997
01:43:31,414 --> 01:43:33,498
Forgive me.

998
01:43:33,666 --> 01:43:36,501
A mother loves too much.

999
01:43:42,717 --> 01:43:45,343
Who shall I sing to sleep
at night anymore?

1000
01:43:50,475 --> 01:43:55,437
I wish... I wish we could spend
more time together.

1001
01:43:56,189 --> 01:44:00,650
Like we used to, when you were
the sweetest boy.

1002
01:44:05,948 --> 01:44:08,074
There's never been time, Mother.

1003
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:13,789
Since I was a child, I've been groomed
to be ever the best.

1004
01:44:14,832 --> 01:44:19,294
My poor child, you're like Achilles...

1005
01:44:19,462 --> 01:44:21,963
...cursed by your greatness.

1006
01:44:26,427 --> 01:44:28,553
Yes. Take my strength.

1007
01:44:34,268 --> 01:44:38,563
You must never confuse your feelings...

1008
01:44:38,731 --> 01:44:41,817
...with your duties, Alexander.

1009
01:44:42,235 --> 01:44:46,738
A king must make public gestures
for the common people.

1010
01:44:46,906 --> 01:44:50,325
I know, but you will be 19 this summer...

1011
01:44:50,493 --> 01:44:55,247
...and the girls already say you don't
like them. You like Hephaistion more.

1012
01:44:55,414 --> 01:44:58,875
I understand.
It's natural for a young man.

1013
01:44:59,043 --> 01:45:03,255
But if you go to Asia without leaving
your successor, you risk all.

1014
01:45:03,422 --> 01:45:08,885
Hephaistion loves me,
as I am...

1015
01:45:09,846 --> 01:45:11,179
...not who.

1016
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:16,142
Loves? Loves?

1017
01:45:18,145 --> 01:45:20,689
In the name of Dionysus...

1018
01:45:22,024 --> 01:45:28,530
...understand how Philip thinks,
for your own sake.

1019
01:45:28,698 --> 01:45:32,617
Your life hangs in the balance.

1020
01:45:33,035 --> 01:45:38,874
I know these things, Alexander.
You are nothing to him.

1021
01:45:39,417 --> 01:45:43,712
His spies are inside your closest circle...

1022
01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:47,424
...to ensure that
you don't plot against him.

1023
01:45:47,592 --> 01:45:50,677
And still you sleep.

1024
01:45:52,221 --> 01:45:55,765
You will not live out this year
unless you act!

1025
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:57,392
Stop!

1026
01:45:59,729 --> 01:46:02,480
I'm his only worthy son.

1027
01:46:02,648 --> 01:46:04,649
You crazed woman.

1028
01:46:05,735 --> 01:46:07,777
He'd never hurt me.

1029
01:46:08,905 --> 01:46:13,658
Even if Eurydice had a boy,
he'd be 20 before he'd let him rule.

1030
01:46:13,826 --> 01:46:17,245
Yes, and you would be 40.

1031
01:46:17,413 --> 01:46:23,793
Old and wise like Parmenion.
And Philip's young son would be 20.

1032
01:46:23,961 --> 01:46:30,342
Like you now,
but raised by him, his blood.

1033
01:46:30,927 --> 01:46:34,304
He will never give you
the throne now, Alexander.

1034
01:46:34,472 --> 01:46:36,014
Never.

1035
01:46:38,267 --> 01:46:40,393
What would you have me do?

1036
01:46:41,228 --> 01:46:43,939
Whatever is necessary.

1037
01:46:47,318 --> 01:46:50,028
Where have you lost your mind?

1038
01:46:50,446 --> 01:46:52,864
It would be civil war,
clan against clan, chaos.

1039
01:46:53,032 --> 01:46:55,951
Yes. And you would win.

1040
01:46:56,118 --> 01:46:58,745
Because the young ones
love you like a god.

1041
01:46:58,913 --> 01:47:01,206
I forbid you to ever talk to me like that!

1042
01:47:01,749 --> 01:47:04,626
Such a man would be forever chased
by the Furies!

1043
01:47:04,794 --> 01:47:08,421
What have you to fear from the Furies...

1044
01:47:08,589 --> 01:47:11,758
...for killing an impostor to the throne...

1045
01:47:11,926 --> 01:47:15,470
...before he murders you
and your mother?

1046
01:47:15,638 --> 01:47:18,348
Why won't you ever believe me?

1047
01:47:18,516 --> 01:47:22,143
Philip did not want you.

1048
01:47:22,728 --> 01:47:24,646
You had a condition of the breathing...

1049
01:47:24,814 --> 01:47:27,232
...and he wanted to leave you
in the mountains...

1050
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:30,527
...for the birds to peck at your eyes.

1051
01:47:31,821 --> 01:47:34,114
What you don't know, my poor child.

1052
01:47:34,281 --> 01:47:37,033
Lanice knows nothing of this.

1053
01:47:37,243 --> 01:47:38,493
Lanice.

1054
01:47:39,286 --> 01:47:41,830
I was there.

1055
01:47:41,998 --> 01:47:44,624
Lanice was not.

1056
01:47:45,001 --> 01:47:47,252
No, Alexander...

1057
01:47:47,420 --> 01:47:50,922
...Zeus is your father.

1058
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:56,469
I laid with him that night in the wind,
as sure as any mortal man.

1059
01:47:56,637 --> 01:48:00,181
Never have I been made love to
as I was then.

1060
01:48:00,349 --> 01:48:01,766
Enough.

1061
01:48:02,601 --> 01:48:06,396
Half the mothers in Greece
share such a fantasy.

1062
01:48:06,981 --> 01:48:08,940
I warn you, Mother.

1063
01:48:09,108 --> 01:48:11,234
Make no mistake.

1064
01:48:12,194 --> 01:48:16,698
You will treat this girl as nothing
more important than his other wives.

1065
01:48:16,866 --> 01:48:20,368
You will behave as we always have.

1066
01:48:20,536 --> 01:48:22,245
As the first.

1067
01:48:32,715 --> 01:48:34,549
I wonder...

1068
01:48:35,885 --> 01:48:37,385
...did you ever love him?

1069
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:42,724
What?

1070
01:48:45,102 --> 01:48:47,187
I never stopped.

1071
01:49:21,472 --> 01:49:23,348
What is it, Orestes?

1072
01:49:28,187 --> 01:49:30,271
I beg your forgiveness, my king.

1073
01:49:31,232 --> 01:49:33,441
I cannot be part of this.

1074
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:36,778
Who did this?

1075
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:41,324
Tell me.

1076
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:43,743
- Say it!
- Hermolaus!

1077
01:49:55,422 --> 01:49:58,967
Death to all tyrants.

1078
01:50:01,470 --> 01:50:03,346
I didn't do this!

1079
01:50:03,973 --> 01:50:08,184
I've known you and loved you
as long as I know.

1080
01:50:09,311 --> 01:50:12,021
Never will you find a man
as devoted as I.

1081
01:50:12,189 --> 01:50:14,816
The conspiracy, such as it was...

1082
01:50:14,984 --> 01:50:17,402
...deeply upset Alexander.

1083
01:50:17,570 --> 01:50:21,489
Not only because it involved
the young people who shared his dream...

1084
01:50:21,657 --> 01:50:27,328
...but more intimately, it implicated
Philotas, his companion from boyhood...

1085
01:50:27,496 --> 01:50:32,500
...when a? Age confessed that a few days
before, he'd informed Philotas...

1086
01:50:32,668 --> 01:50:34,586
- Alexander.
...of the plot.

1087
01:50:36,422 --> 01:50:38,006
Remember me for who I am.

1088
01:50:39,425 --> 01:50:44,804
I do remember you, Philotas,
but not as you remember yourself.

1089
01:50:45,431 --> 01:50:50,476
And it appears to me and others here
from the testimony given by your mistress...

1090
01:50:50,978 --> 01:50:54,480
...that the true weather of your soul
is ambition.

1091
01:50:55,524 --> 01:50:56,524
No.

1092
01:50:56,692 --> 01:51:00,403
We all felt there was more here
than sexual bickering.

1093
01:51:00,571 --> 01:51:05,200
Alexander wanted the truth and
Philotas' answers were lacking merit.

1094
01:51:05,534 --> 01:51:06,534
Please take him away.

1095
01:51:06,702 --> 01:51:10,955
Alexander put him silently and quickly
to trial by his peers...

1096
01:51:11,123 --> 01:51:15,126
...and whether plotter or opportunist,
Philotas was found guilty of treason.

1097
01:51:15,294 --> 01:51:17,128
- No, Alexander, no!
- Remove him.

1098
01:51:17,296 --> 01:51:20,173
The suspects were all executed.

1099
01:51:20,341 --> 01:51:23,051
None of us defended Philotas...

1100
01:51:23,219 --> 01:51:26,596
...but then again,
none of us ever liked him.

1101
01:51:31,852 --> 01:51:36,314
And of course his power
was carved up by the rest of us.

1102
01:51:38,025 --> 01:51:40,318
Before he died, we tortured him...

1103
01:51:40,486 --> 01:51:43,696
...to find out what
his father, Parmenion, knew.

1104
01:51:43,864 --> 01:51:46,074
But this we never learned.

1105
01:51:46,242 --> 01:51:50,203
What to do with Parmenion and his
20,000 troops guarding our sup? Ly lines...

1106
01:51:50,371 --> 01:51:54,082
...was a far more delicate matter.
Was he innocent in this?

1107
01:51:54,250 --> 01:51:59,379
Or had he decided to act before
age further withered his power?

1108
01:51:59,546 --> 01:52:03,049
- The men will follow their king.
- Alexander won't be there.

1109
01:52:04,218 --> 01:52:07,637
Necessity required Alexander to act...

1110
01:52:07,805 --> 01:52:12,725
...and he sealed the cam? Within the hour
of the first accusations against Philotas.

1111
01:52:14,061 --> 01:52:18,022
Then go, Antigonus, and Cleitus.

1112
01:52:18,190 --> 01:52:20,024
And go quickly.

1113
01:52:23,028 --> 01:52:27,448
Three days' hard riding
sent Antigonus and Cleitus...

1114
01:52:27,616 --> 01:52:32,662
...to Parmenion, the general
most loyal to Philip.

1115
01:52:38,961 --> 01:52:42,463
His soldiers accepted the finding of guilt
against Parmenion...

1116
01:52:42,631 --> 01:52:45,133
...as they understood well
the code of vengeance...

1117
01:52:45,301 --> 01:52:50,179
...that made the head of family
responsible for the behavior of all.

1118
01:52:52,474 --> 01:52:56,686
Many of us felt we were better off
without that pompous thorn, Parmenion...

1119
01:52:56,854 --> 01:53:01,983
...as Alexander? Promoted all of us
generously.

1120
01:53:16,832 --> 01:53:21,336
If we issue the gold bullion in the name
of Alexander then we meet a resistance.

1121
01:53:21,503 --> 01:53:23,755
Cleitus. Antigonus.

1122
01:53:23,922 --> 01:53:25,548
Parmenion.

1123
01:55:39,141 --> 01:55:42,393
Come, Alexander,
drink this sadness away.

1124
01:55:42,561 --> 01:55:44,979
If only thirst could quench sorrow,
Ptolemy.

1125
01:55:48,358 --> 01:55:52,653
There's only one thing better
than winning a battle, son...

1126
01:55:53,405 --> 01:55:56,282
...and that's the taste of a new woman.

1127
01:55:56,450 --> 01:56:01,287
You'll find it far sweeter than self-pity.

1128
01:56:01,455 --> 01:56:03,623
- Pausanias, you bore me.
- Alexander!

1129
01:56:03,790 --> 01:56:06,834
- Be gone with you.
- Alexander, I found you the right girl.

1130
01:56:07,002 --> 01:56:09,253
- What's your name, darling?
- Antigone.

1131
01:56:09,421 --> 01:56:11,380
- What's your name?
- Antigone.

1132
01:56:13,342 --> 01:56:16,511
- I love you.
- And I love you, Cleitus.

1133
01:56:17,346 --> 01:56:19,972
- Please, no!
- There you go.

1134
01:56:23,602 --> 01:56:25,937
I'll sleep in my grave, Hephaistion.

1135
01:56:26,104 --> 01:56:28,940
While alive, I prefer dancing.

1136
01:56:29,107 --> 01:56:30,650
Pausanias.

1137
01:56:31,693 --> 01:56:33,152
Who's your new friend?

1138
01:56:33,445 --> 01:56:35,530
- There's your new friend.
- Please don't!

1139
01:56:35,697 --> 01:56:39,242
Don't! Please, no! No.

1140
01:56:48,502 --> 01:56:49,710
A toast.

1141
01:56:50,379 --> 01:56:51,796
A toast!

1142
01:56:52,339 --> 01:56:57,677
I drink to our Greek friends
and to our new union...

1143
01:56:57,844 --> 01:57:03,724
...Macedonia and Greece,
equals in greatness!

1144
01:57:06,395 --> 01:57:12,692
And to Philip, our king, without whom
this union could not be possible.

1145
01:57:12,859 --> 01:57:15,861
Come, Attalus, leave some
damn air in the hall!

1146
01:57:17,531 --> 01:57:23,286
And last, I drink to the king's marriage
to my niece, Eurydice...

1147
01:57:23,453 --> 01:57:26,581
...a Macedonian queen
we can be proud of!

1148
01:57:29,751 --> 01:57:32,837
To Philip and Eurydice...

1149
01:57:33,005 --> 01:57:36,257
...and to their legitimate sons!

1150
01:57:37,759 --> 01:57:39,468
Alexander, don't!

1151
01:57:39,636 --> 01:57:42,597
What am I, you son of a dog?
Come, then.

1152
01:57:53,609 --> 01:57:56,068
What a disgrace.

1153
01:57:56,236 --> 01:57:57,278
Shut up!

1154
01:57:58,071 --> 01:57:59,947
- Shut up, all of you!
- Please.

1155
01:58:00,449 --> 01:58:03,034
This is my wedding,
not some public brawl.

1156
01:58:03,201 --> 01:58:05,161
Insolent pup.

1157
01:58:05,329 --> 01:58:08,664
Apologize, by Zeus,
before you dishonor me.

1158
01:58:08,832 --> 01:58:12,001
You defend the man who called
my mother a whore and me a bastard.

1159
01:58:12,169 --> 01:58:15,546
- And I dishonor you?
- You listen like your mother.

1160
01:58:15,714 --> 01:58:17,757
Attalus is my family now,
the same as you.

1161
01:58:17,924 --> 01:58:20,635
Then choose your relatives
more carefully.

1162
01:58:20,802 --> 01:58:24,055
Don't expect me to sit here
and watch you shame yourself.

1163
01:58:24,222 --> 01:58:27,266
- You insult me!
- I insult you!

1164
01:58:27,434 --> 01:58:30,394
A man not fit to lick the ground
my mother walks on.

1165
01:58:30,562 --> 01:58:33,606
- You dog, questioning your queen.
- Shame?

1166
01:58:33,774 --> 01:58:37,568
I've nothing to be ashamed of,
you arrogant brat.

1167
01:58:37,736 --> 01:58:41,614
I'll marry the girl if I want,
and I'll have as many sons as I want.

1168
01:58:41,782 --> 01:58:44,367
There's nothing you
or your harpy mother can do.

1169
01:58:44,534 --> 01:58:46,327
Why, drunken man, must you think...

1170
01:58:46,495 --> 01:58:48,954
...everything I do and say
comes from my mother?

1171
01:58:49,122 --> 01:58:52,083
Because I know her heart, by Hera...

1172
01:58:52,250 --> 01:58:54,460
...and I see her in your eyes.

1173
01:58:54,628 --> 01:58:57,171
You covet this throne too much.

1174
01:58:58,423 --> 01:59:03,844
We all know that she-wolf
of a mother of yours wants me dead.

1175
01:59:04,012 --> 01:59:06,222
Well, you can both dream, boy.

1176
01:59:06,390 --> 01:59:09,517
Philip, this is the wine talking.
Leave the boy. It'll wait.

1177
01:59:09,685 --> 01:59:11,268
Now!

1178
01:59:12,437 --> 01:59:14,355
I command you.

1179
01:59:15,357 --> 01:59:18,651
Apologize to your kinsman.

1180
01:59:26,284 --> 01:59:28,035
Apologize.

1181
01:59:28,203 --> 01:59:30,705
No kinsman to me.

1182
01:59:34,292 --> 01:59:36,252
Good night, old man.

1183
01:59:37,796 --> 01:59:42,216
And when my mother remarries,
I'll invite you to her wedding.

1184
01:59:42,759 --> 01:59:44,719
You bastard!

1185
01:59:50,517 --> 01:59:52,226
You'll obey me. Come here.

1186
02:00:11,121 --> 02:00:14,749
This is the man who is going to
take you from Greece to Persia?

1187
02:00:14,916 --> 02:00:17,418
He can't even make it
from one couch to the next.

1188
02:00:17,753 --> 02:00:21,672
Get out of my palace!
You're exiled, you bastard!

1189
02:00:22,424 --> 02:00:25,760
Banished from the land.
You're not welcome here.

1190
02:00:26,678 --> 02:00:28,929
You're no son of mine!

1191
02:01:12,682 --> 02:01:16,811
In the spring, Alexander marched
an army of 150,000...

1192
02:01:16,978 --> 02:01:20,022
...across the passes of the Hindu Kush...

1193
02:01:20,565 --> 02:01:22,566
...into the unknown.

1194
02:01:23,819 --> 02:01:28,656
In his dream, it was the promised route
to the end of the world.

1195
02:01:28,824 --> 02:01:30,699
We were now a mobile empire...

1196
02:01:30,867 --> 02:01:34,745
...stretching back thousands of miles
to Greece.

1197
02:01:34,913 --> 02:01:37,665
Cooks and architects,
doctors, surveyors...

1198
02:01:37,833 --> 02:01:39,458
...moneylenders and wives...

1199
02:01:39,626 --> 02:01:42,503
...children, lovers, whores.

1200
02:01:42,671 --> 02:01:44,421
And slaves...

1201
02:01:44,589 --> 02:01:49,260
...that anonymous, bent, working spine
of this new beast.

1202
02:01:49,427 --> 02:01:53,264
Ravaged or expanded, for better or worse...

1203
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:58,727
...no occupied territory
remained the same again.

1204
02:02:02,065 --> 02:02:04,108
Although devoted to Roxane...

1205
02:02:04,276 --> 02:02:07,361
...Alexander's visits
to her tent diminished...

1206
02:02:07,529 --> 02:02:12,658
...as a year, then two, went by
without a successor...

1207
02:02:13,451 --> 02:02:16,704
...wounding Alexander's great pride.

1208
02:02:17,038 --> 02:02:20,624
The surveyors are saying that Zeus
chained Prometheus up there.

1209
02:02:20,792 --> 02:02:22,042
In one of those caves.

1210
02:02:24,004 --> 02:02:26,714
They say there's a giant eagle's nest
just above it.

1211
02:02:27,048 --> 02:02:31,844
I suppose he drops down each night
to peck out poor Prometheus' liver.

1212
02:02:34,472 --> 02:02:37,933
You remember what Aristotle told us
of these mountains?

1213
02:02:38,810 --> 02:02:40,477
Yes, I do.

1214
02:02:41,271 --> 02:02:43,397
That when we reach these heights...

1215
02:02:43,565 --> 02:02:46,775
...we'd look back and see Macedonia
to the west...

1216
02:02:46,943 --> 02:02:49,570
...and the outer ocean to the east.

1217
02:02:53,617 --> 02:02:58,662
But I fear this world is far larger
than anyone dreamed.

1218
02:02:58,830 --> 02:03:00,956
A world of Titans.

1219
02:03:01,124 --> 02:03:05,127
The scouts have been up
every known trail, Alexander.

1220
02:03:05,295 --> 02:03:07,546
There is no way across.

1221
02:03:08,089 --> 02:03:12,259
Except to the south, into India.

1222
02:03:12,677 --> 02:03:15,763
Were we gods, we'd breach
these walls to the eastern ocean.

1223
02:03:16,598 --> 02:03:18,265
We will, Alexander.

1224
02:03:18,433 --> 02:03:21,101
In a few years' time, we will return.

1225
02:03:21,269 --> 02:03:25,105
But first, the men must see their homes.

1226
02:03:26,566 --> 02:03:28,609
Have you found your home...

1227
02:03:28,777 --> 02:03:30,444
...Ptolemy?

1228
02:03:35,116 --> 02:03:38,327
More and more, I think
it will be Alexandria.

1229
02:03:40,455 --> 02:03:42,623
Well, at least it's hot.

1230
02:03:43,625 --> 02:03:45,334
And Thais...

1231
02:03:46,211 --> 02:03:48,295
...she loved it there.

1232
02:03:50,048 --> 02:03:52,299
Women bring men home.

1233
02:03:53,426 --> 02:03:58,347
- I have no such feeling.
- You have Babylon, Alexander.

1234
02:03:58,515 --> 02:04:00,641
Where your mother awaits your invitation.

1235
02:04:01,101 --> 02:04:03,602
Yes, I have Babylon.

1236
02:04:03,770 --> 02:04:08,148
But each land, each boundary I cross...

1237
02:04:08,316 --> 02:04:10,651
...I strip away another illusion.

1238
02:04:11,987 --> 02:04:14,321
I sense death will be the last.

1239
02:04:17,075 --> 02:04:20,536
Yet still I push harder and harder...

1240
02:04:20,704 --> 02:04:24,289
...to reach this home.

1241
02:04:29,838 --> 02:04:31,296
Where has our eagle gone?

1242
02:04:35,885 --> 02:04:38,012
We must go on, Ptolemy.

1243
02:04:39,305 --> 02:04:40,973
Until we find an end.

1244
02:06:29,874 --> 02:06:33,543
India, the land where the sun was born...

1245
02:06:33,711 --> 02:06:36,296
...fabled to be even richer than Persia...

1246
02:06:36,464 --> 02:06:40,509
...had never been explored or conquered.

1247
02:06:40,677 --> 02:06:46,014
From the beginning, we struggled
to unify a land without a center.

1248
02:06:46,182 --> 02:06:48,892
Kings who conspired against one another.

1249
02:06:49,060 --> 02:06:53,146
A labyrinth of tribes urged on
by zealots and philosophers...

1250
02:06:53,314 --> 02:06:57,526
...to die by the thousands
for their strange gods.

1251
02:07:02,115 --> 02:07:05,909
We saw things we'd never dreamed
and could hardly describe.

1252
02:07:06,285 --> 02:07:09,246
We saw birds that could talk
and men that couldn't.

1253
02:07:11,165 --> 02:07:15,168
Crateros, in the advance party,
fought against men with hairy skins...

1254
02:07:15,336 --> 02:07:17,754
...who were tiny and
lived in the tops of trees.

1255
02:07:23,511 --> 02:07:26,263
- Over there!
- They're animals.

1256
02:07:26,431 --> 02:07:29,975
Until Hephaistion convinced us
these were animals who imitated men...

1257
02:07:30,143 --> 02:07:32,269
...but wore their own skin.

1258
02:07:33,479 --> 02:07:36,440
They called this tribe "monkey."

1259
02:07:37,108 --> 02:07:40,110
Monkey. Monkey.

1260
02:07:41,154 --> 02:07:44,906
But we saw little difference with
the tribes who lived among them.

1261
02:07:46,659 --> 02:07:50,037
- Look at his hand.
- It's so much like ours.

1262
02:07:53,708 --> 02:07:54,958
Hello, little man.

1263
02:07:55,793 --> 02:08:00,756
- Do they speak?
- No, but they do sing and make noises...

1264
02:08:00,923 --> 02:08:03,008
...from the roofs of the forest.

1265
02:08:06,971 --> 02:08:08,847
We saw men
who walked naked in public...

1266
02:08:09,015 --> 02:08:13,226
...and spent hours at a time
staring and doing nothing.

1267
02:08:13,519 --> 02:08:16,646
Some who lived 200 years.

1268
02:08:18,232 --> 02:08:20,984
And then, there was the rain.

1269
02:08:26,824 --> 02:08:30,535
Never before had we seen water
that fell from the gods...

1270
02:08:30,703 --> 02:08:32,204
...for 60 days and nights.

1271
02:08:33,414 --> 02:08:35,499
Well done today.

1272
02:08:37,627 --> 02:08:39,920
Make sure the women and children
are fed.

1273
02:08:45,676 --> 02:08:47,803
You know better, Machatas.

1274
02:08:51,349 --> 02:08:52,766
What's your son going to say?

1275
02:08:53,101 --> 02:08:55,519
Come on, man.
The older you get, the stronger.

1276
02:08:55,686 --> 02:08:59,231
Right, my king.
You're my horse, Alexander.

1277
02:08:59,398 --> 02:09:01,691
I'll be with you at your side.

1278
02:09:04,195 --> 02:09:05,987
Everything rotted in this rain...

1279
02:09:06,155 --> 02:09:10,367
...and scores of men died miserably
from the tiny serpents...

1280
02:09:10,535 --> 02:09:14,287
...that were everywhere in this evil land.

1281
02:09:16,124 --> 02:09:17,749
- What happened?
- It's to the neck.

1282
02:09:17,917 --> 02:09:20,377
Oh, no. Zeus, no.

1283
02:09:20,545 --> 02:09:22,087
Hold on. Hold on.

1284
02:09:24,966 --> 02:09:28,093
Be brave.

1285
02:09:28,261 --> 02:09:30,303
Oh, Zeus.

1286
02:09:32,056 --> 02:09:35,475
Our quest for gold and glory evaporated
as we realized...

1287
02:09:35,893 --> 02:09:38,061
...there was none to be had.

1288
02:09:38,729 --> 02:09:40,564
Tempers worsened.

1289
02:09:40,731 --> 02:09:43,692
We massacred all Indians who resisted.

1290
02:09:43,860 --> 02:09:45,944
And with the local water putrid...

1291
02:09:46,112 --> 02:09:48,905
...we drank the strong wine.

1292
02:10:42,919 --> 02:10:45,545
And as we moved south and east...

1293
02:10:45,713 --> 02:10:50,634
...Alexander often returned the lands
we'd conquered to their defeated kings...

1294
02:10:50,801 --> 02:10:52,636
...so as to make them allies.

1295
02:10:52,803 --> 02:10:55,847
But this did not sit well with the army...

1296
02:10:56,015 --> 02:10:57,307
...who began to wonder:

1297
02:10:58,100 --> 02:11:01,186
Were we here for riches?
Or had Alexander...

1298
02:11:01,354 --> 02:11:05,732
...in some remorseless and crazed quest
to imitate the glory of Herakles...

1299
02:11:05,900 --> 02:11:07,442
...forgotten them?

1300
02:11:08,194 --> 02:11:11,613
One thing an army
knows quickly in their bones...

1301
02:11:11,781 --> 02:11:14,199
...is which way the gods are blowing.

1302
02:12:42,288 --> 02:12:44,080
Kiss him!

1303
02:13:08,689 --> 02:13:11,274
- To Bagoas.
- To Bagoas!

1304
02:13:16,781 --> 02:13:20,909
- And to my mother's god, Dionysus...
- Dionysus!

1305
02:13:21,077 --> 02:13:25,413
...who, we're told by our Indian allies,
traveled here before Herakles...

1306
02:13:25,581 --> 02:13:28,333
...some 6000 years ago.

1307
02:13:28,501 --> 02:13:29,959
To a hero.

1308
02:13:30,127 --> 02:13:32,128
To a hero!

1309
02:13:51,982 --> 02:13:53,316
Roxane.

1310
02:14:00,157 --> 02:14:02,617
You lose face.

1311
02:14:02,785 --> 02:14:04,327
These Indians...

1312
02:14:04,495 --> 02:14:06,246
...they are a low, evil people.

1313
02:14:06,414 --> 02:14:08,832
You don't try to understand them.

1314
02:14:09,125 --> 02:14:11,334
I try.

1315
02:14:11,502 --> 02:14:14,462
But this I know, Alexander.

1316
02:14:14,713 --> 02:14:17,715
In Persia, you are a great king.

1317
02:14:18,050 --> 02:14:19,634
Here...

1318
02:14:19,802 --> 02:14:21,761
...they hate you.

1319
02:14:24,557 --> 02:14:27,767
Let us go back to Babylon.

1320
02:14:28,811 --> 02:14:30,437
There, you are strong.

1321
02:14:32,690 --> 02:14:34,941
We'll talk about this later.

1322
02:14:35,109 --> 02:14:36,568
Yes.

1323
02:14:36,735 --> 02:14:38,319
Later.

1324
02:14:38,487 --> 02:14:40,029
Talk.

1325
02:14:42,741 --> 02:14:44,784
I shall come.

1326
02:14:44,952 --> 02:14:46,202
Tonight.

1327
02:14:47,204 --> 02:14:49,080
And I shall wait.

1328
02:14:50,916 --> 02:14:53,042
Good night, my king.

1329
02:14:54,545 --> 02:14:56,713
Your Majesty.

1330
02:14:58,466 --> 02:15:01,509
Come, Alexander, drink with us.

1331
02:15:03,888 --> 02:15:07,015
- Alexander.
- Alexander!

1332
02:15:08,976 --> 02:15:13,730
I remember a time
you hated how your father drank.

1333
02:15:13,898 --> 02:15:15,899
Now I know why.

1334
02:15:17,443 --> 02:15:21,488
Dionysus is hero.

1335
02:15:22,615 --> 02:15:26,326
But he is also mind breaker.

1336
02:15:26,494 --> 02:15:29,829
He destroys our self-control.

1337
02:15:30,372 --> 02:15:33,917
Self-control is a lover
I've known too long, Ptolemy.

1338
02:15:37,379 --> 02:15:40,256
The struggle worries me to the bone.

1339
02:15:41,467 --> 02:15:44,511
And success I find to be
as corrupt as failure.

1340
02:15:45,721 --> 02:15:49,933
But Dionysus,
bless his ancient soul...

1341
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:52,810
...frees me from myself.

1342
02:15:53,187 --> 02:15:56,773
And then, I move up.

1343
02:15:59,777 --> 02:16:02,445
I am simply Alexander.

1344
02:16:06,659 --> 02:16:08,451
A toast to Bagoas.

1345
02:16:10,120 --> 02:16:14,749
And the 30,000 beautiful Persian boys...

1346
02:16:14,917 --> 02:16:17,460
...we're training to fight
in this great army.

1347
02:16:20,381 --> 02:16:22,465
And to the memory of Philip.

1348
02:16:22,633 --> 02:16:25,552
Had he lived to see his Macedonians...

1349
02:16:25,719 --> 02:16:28,763
...transformed into such...

1350
02:16:28,931 --> 02:16:30,515
...a pretty army.

1351
02:16:32,810 --> 02:16:34,143
To Philip.

1352
02:16:34,311 --> 02:16:36,396
To a real hero.

1353
02:16:36,564 --> 02:16:38,815
Philip!

1354
02:16:41,652 --> 02:16:46,447
To Cleitus and his new appointment
as satrap of Bactria.

1355
02:16:46,615 --> 02:16:48,241
Cleitus.

1356
02:16:49,660 --> 02:16:52,328
That's a fancy way of putting it, Ptolemy.

1357
02:16:52,496 --> 02:16:55,540
But we all know what a pension
and an exile is...

1358
02:16:55,708 --> 02:16:57,875
...after 30 years' service.

1359
02:16:58,085 --> 02:16:59,752
Exile?

1360
02:17:00,004 --> 02:17:01,796
From where, Cleitus?

1361
02:17:01,964 --> 02:17:04,674
From my home, Alexander, Macedonia.

1362
02:17:04,842 --> 02:17:08,511
You could've asked me where I
wanted to spend the rest of my life.

1363
02:17:08,762 --> 02:17:12,765
You call governing
this major province exile?

1364
02:17:12,933 --> 02:17:16,019
Has Your Majesty given any
of his closest companions...

1365
02:17:16,812 --> 02:17:18,980
...a province so far from home?

1366
02:17:19,148 --> 02:17:22,525
Then you won't make a very
good satrap, will you, Cleitus?

1367
02:17:25,821 --> 02:17:27,447
So be it.

1368
02:17:27,615 --> 02:17:31,200
Let me rot in Macedonian rags...

1369
02:17:31,368 --> 02:17:33,536
...rather than shine...

1370
02:17:33,704 --> 02:17:35,830
...in Eastern pomp.

1371
02:17:36,332 --> 02:17:40,126
I won't quake and bow down
like the sycophants you have around you.

1372
02:17:40,294 --> 02:17:44,380
Hephaistion, Nearchus, Perdiccas.

1373
02:17:45,007 --> 02:17:49,385
As governor of one
of our most Asian of satrapies...

1374
02:17:49,553 --> 02:17:54,432
...Cleitus, does it not occur to you
that if my Persian subjects...

1375
02:17:54,600 --> 02:17:57,644
...bow down before me,
it's important for them to do so?

1376
02:17:57,811 --> 02:18:00,563
Do I insist on Greeks doing the same?

1377
02:18:00,731 --> 02:18:05,777
You accept Greek offerings
as a son of Zeus, do you not?

1378
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:09,155
Only when offered.

1379
02:18:09,323 --> 02:18:12,158
Why don't you refuse
these vain flatteries?

1380
02:18:12,326 --> 02:18:14,911
What freedom is this, to bow before you?

1381
02:18:15,079 --> 02:18:17,830
You bow before Herakles,
and he was mortal...

1382
02:18:17,998 --> 02:18:19,582
...but a son of Zeus.

1383
02:18:19,750 --> 02:18:23,378
How can you, so young,
compare yourself to Herakles?

1384
02:18:24,588 --> 02:18:26,589
Why not?

1385
02:18:29,176 --> 02:18:31,636
I've achieved more in my years.

1386
02:18:31,804 --> 02:18:33,346
Traveled as far.

1387
02:18:33,514 --> 02:18:34,597
Probably farther.

1388
02:18:34,765 --> 02:18:37,016
Herakles did it by himself.

1389
02:18:37,184 --> 02:18:40,311
Did you conquer Asia
by yourself, Alexander?

1390
02:18:40,479 --> 02:18:42,230
Who planned the Asian invasion...

1391
02:18:42,398 --> 02:18:46,234
...when you were still being spanked
on your bottom by my sister Lanice?

1392
02:18:46,402 --> 02:18:48,319
Was it not your father?

1393
02:18:48,487 --> 02:18:50,446
Or is his blood no longer good enough?

1394
02:18:50,948 --> 02:18:54,534
- Zeus-Amon, is it?
- You insult me, Cleitus.

1395
02:18:54,702 --> 02:18:57,286
You mock my family. Be careful.

1396
02:18:57,830 --> 02:19:01,290
Never would your father have taken
barbarians as his friends...

1397
02:19:01,458 --> 02:19:04,085
...asked us to fight with them
as equals in war.

1398
02:19:04,253 --> 02:19:06,170
Are we not good enough any longer?

1399
02:19:06,338 --> 02:19:08,464
I remember a time...

1400
02:19:08,632 --> 02:19:11,342
...when we could talk as men,
straight to the eye.

1401
02:19:11,510 --> 02:19:14,262
None of this scraping, groveling.

1402
02:19:14,930 --> 02:19:17,098
I remember a time when we hunted...

1403
02:19:17,266 --> 02:19:20,309
...when we wrestled
on the gymnasium floor.

1404
02:19:20,477 --> 02:19:22,311
Now you kiss them?

1405
02:19:23,981 --> 02:19:28,985
Take a barbarian, childless wife
and dare call her queen?

1406
02:19:31,321 --> 02:19:35,283
Go quickly, Cleitus,
before you ruin your life.

1407
02:19:39,121 --> 02:19:42,623
Doesn't your great pride
fear the gods any longer?

1408
02:19:43,959 --> 02:19:47,336
This army...
This army is your blood, boy!

1409
02:19:47,504 --> 02:19:49,589
Without it, you're nothing!

1410
02:19:54,720 --> 02:19:58,055
You no longer serve the purpose
of this march!

1411
02:19:58,557 --> 02:20:01,267
- Get him from my sight!
- I don't serve your purpose?!

1412
02:20:01,435 --> 02:20:05,188
What was I serving when I saved
your puppy life at Gaugamela?

1413
02:20:05,355 --> 02:20:08,858
Were you Zeus' boy?
What if I left you to die in the dust there?

1414
02:20:09,026 --> 02:20:12,570
Do you think we'd be forced now
to mate with brown apes?

1415
02:20:12,738 --> 02:20:13,988
Alexander!

1416
02:20:14,156 --> 02:20:17,700
Turn out the guards!
Arrest him for treason!

1417
02:20:22,206 --> 02:20:23,873
- I'll go with him.
- Alexander.

1418
02:20:24,041 --> 02:20:25,708
- Who's with him?
- No.

1419
02:20:25,876 --> 02:20:27,376
Who's with him?

1420
02:20:28,045 --> 02:20:30,213
I call Father Zeus to witness.

1421
02:20:30,380 --> 02:20:32,673
I call you to trial before him!

1422
02:20:32,841 --> 02:20:35,343
And we'll see how deep
this conspiracy cuts!

1423
02:20:35,511 --> 02:20:38,054
- Take him!
- In the name of the gods, get him out!

1424
02:20:38,222 --> 02:20:42,308
Now look at you!
Great white ass, Alexander.

1425
02:20:42,476 --> 02:20:44,268
Hiding behind his fairy god!

1426
02:20:44,436 --> 02:20:50,191
Or are you too great to remember
whose life was saved by me?!

1427
02:20:50,901 --> 02:20:56,239
- I am more a man than you'll ever be! Ever!
- Get him out!

1428
02:20:57,074 --> 02:21:01,077
- He's gone. He's gone.
- Alexander.

1429
02:21:01,245 --> 02:21:02,411
Come on!

1430
02:21:02,955 --> 02:21:07,708
What a tyrant you are!
An evil tyrant you've become, Alexander.

1431
02:21:07,876 --> 02:21:10,920
You speak of plots against you?
What about poor Parmenion?

1432
02:21:11,505 --> 02:21:12,505
Get out!

1433
02:21:12,673 --> 02:21:15,424
He served you well.
Look how you repaid him.

1434
02:21:15,592 --> 02:21:18,386
You made me do your foul deed.
Have you no shame?

1435
02:21:18,554 --> 02:21:22,431
You ungrateful wretch! No one, not my
vilest enemy, has spoken like you to me.

1436
02:21:22,599 --> 02:21:25,852
Hear what I say!
Despot. False king.

1437
02:21:27,312 --> 02:21:30,022
You and your barbarian mother
live in shame.

1438
02:21:54,840 --> 02:21:56,424
Cleitus.

1439
02:21:56,758 --> 02:21:59,260
Oh, my Cleitus. Cleitus.

1440
02:22:06,059 --> 02:22:07,602
- Let me pass.
- None can enter.

1441
02:22:07,769 --> 02:22:09,645
I am the queen.

1442
02:22:17,738 --> 02:22:19,906
I want to see him.
I've waited three days.

1443
02:22:20,073 --> 02:22:22,783
He says none, not even you.

1444
02:22:23,911 --> 02:22:27,830
- He needs me.
- No, he doesn't.

1445
02:22:27,998 --> 02:22:29,749
And he needs you?

1446
02:22:31,460 --> 02:22:33,169
Hephaistion, you make a mistake.

1447
02:22:36,882 --> 02:22:40,968
The army grows restless, questioning.

1448
02:22:42,179 --> 02:22:43,930
Alexander.

1449
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:48,351
They need your reassurance.

1450
02:22:49,478 --> 02:22:51,187
Heinous.

1451
02:22:51,355 --> 02:22:55,191
Like an old lover they forgive,
but they will never forget.

1452
02:22:55,567 --> 02:23:00,279
- He was an aging drunk.
- He was my friend.

1453
02:23:02,199 --> 02:23:04,992
His sister Lanice nursed me.

1454
02:23:05,869 --> 02:23:08,079
And how did I repay her?

1455
02:23:09,539 --> 02:23:12,959
Two brothers dead,
fighting him by my own hands.

1456
02:23:13,126 --> 02:23:15,586
Her last remaining blood.

1457
02:23:19,049 --> 02:23:23,219
What will she do but weep
on the day of my birth?

1458
02:23:24,888 --> 02:23:27,014
Come. You know more than any...

1459
02:23:27,182 --> 02:23:31,936
...great deeds are done by men
who took and never regretted.

1460
02:23:32,104 --> 02:23:34,021
You're Alexander.

1461
02:23:34,189 --> 02:23:36,941
Pity and grief will only destroy you.

1462
02:23:37,109 --> 02:23:40,736
Have I become so arrogant
that I am blind?

1463
02:23:43,490 --> 02:23:49,036
Sometimes, to expect
the best of everyone is...

1464
02:23:49,204 --> 02:23:50,705
...arrogance.

1465
02:23:52,207 --> 02:23:57,586
Then Cleitus spoke true.
I have become a tyrant.

1466
02:23:58,422 --> 02:23:59,964
No.

1467
02:24:02,426 --> 02:24:04,552
But perhaps a stranger.

1468
02:24:06,346 --> 02:24:07,596
You've gone too far.

1469
02:24:09,725 --> 02:24:12,435
They don't understand you anymore.

1470
02:24:14,229 --> 02:24:18,232
They speak of Philip now...

1471
02:24:18,400 --> 02:24:22,319
...as if I were a passing cloud...

1472
02:24:22,487 --> 02:24:24,613
...soon to be forgotten.

1473
02:24:26,742 --> 02:24:28,576
I've failed...

1474
02:24:28,744 --> 02:24:30,453
...utterly.

1475
02:24:32,539 --> 02:24:34,373
You're mortal.

1476
02:24:34,833 --> 02:24:36,792
And they know it.

1477
02:24:36,960 --> 02:24:41,297
And they forgive you because
you make them proud of themselves.

1478
02:24:41,965 --> 02:24:44,884
Philip once said...

1479
02:24:46,845 --> 02:24:49,472
...that there's a Titan in all of us.

1480
02:24:50,474 --> 02:24:53,476
That they wait, mixed in our ashes.

1481
02:24:58,899 --> 02:25:01,317
It wasn't because of the wine, I killed.

1482
02:25:01,860 --> 02:25:04,236
It was because I wanted to.

1483
02:25:32,432 --> 02:25:35,601
Philip, King of Macedonia...

1484
02:25:35,769 --> 02:25:37,686
...and leader of the Greeks.

1485
02:25:38,438 --> 02:25:43,400
All my life, I've waited to see Greeks
grovel with respect for Macedonia.

1486
02:25:44,694 --> 02:25:46,821
Today is that day.

1487
02:25:51,284 --> 02:25:54,036
They say already,
"Philip was a great general...

1488
02:25:54,204 --> 02:25:58,040
...but Alexander is simply great."

1489
02:25:59,626 --> 02:26:02,294
But if you ever insult me again...

1490
02:26:02,462 --> 02:26:04,088
...I’ll kill you.

1491
02:26:10,262 --> 02:26:11,679
I've missed you.

1492
02:26:11,847 --> 02:26:14,390
In the spring, Persia.

1493
02:26:14,558 --> 02:26:16,851
You'll command my horse from the right.

1494
02:26:17,018 --> 02:26:19,228
I'm honored, Father. I wouldn't miss it...

1495
02:26:19,396 --> 02:26:21,147
...for all the gold in the world.

1496
02:26:21,314 --> 02:26:23,440
Which, one day, you'll have.

1497
02:26:40,417 --> 02:26:42,877
Making himself a 13th god.

1498
02:26:43,044 --> 02:26:47,256
He's drunk so much wine,
my poor Philip, he's lost his mind.

1499
02:26:50,552 --> 02:26:53,262
- Your Majesty.
- Attalus.

1500
02:26:57,767 --> 02:27:00,603
I hope the prince
is enjoying the spectacle...

1501
02:27:00,770 --> 02:27:03,689
...as much as our regent.

1502
02:27:03,857 --> 02:27:05,399
He's very tired.

1503
02:27:09,696 --> 02:27:11,906
Hey.

1504
02:27:14,284 --> 02:27:17,411
- Pausanias, bring the rest of the guard.
- Royal guard!

1505
02:27:17,662 --> 02:27:20,372
To the arena! March!

1506
02:27:20,540 --> 02:27:23,459
No guard, Your Majesty?
In all this crowd?

1507
02:27:23,627 --> 02:27:26,962
- Greeks all over the place.
- Cleitus, Cleitus.

1508
02:27:27,672 --> 02:27:29,215
My Cleitus.

1509
02:27:29,716 --> 02:27:32,301
This man you can
always trust, Alexander.

1510
02:27:32,761 --> 02:27:34,345
Treat him as you would me.

1511
02:27:34,512 --> 02:27:36,722
He'll guard your back for you.

1512
02:27:37,224 --> 02:27:39,058
Yes, Father.

1513
02:27:39,226 --> 02:27:42,144
My people are guard enough today.

1514
02:27:42,312 --> 02:27:45,773
Let these Greeks see for themselves
how I can walk through my people.

1515
02:27:45,941 --> 02:27:47,483
Then let them call me tyrant.

1516
02:27:47,984 --> 02:27:51,320
Bring the main guard in
after my entry only.

1517
02:27:51,488 --> 02:27:55,157
Cleitus, make sure the wine
flows steady all day.

1518
02:27:55,325 --> 02:27:57,326
I want them to like me.

1519
02:28:04,459 --> 02:28:07,169
Weren't you told? I go in alone.

1520
02:28:07,337 --> 02:28:09,338
Follow with the main guard.

1521
02:28:09,506 --> 02:28:10,923
Go on.

1522
02:28:13,969 --> 02:28:17,304
- Go on.
- Father, it's best I go with you.

1523
02:28:19,516 --> 02:28:22,685
You want the world to see
you're my successor.

1524
02:28:22,852 --> 02:28:24,770
Is that what she wants?

1525
02:28:25,230 --> 02:28:28,023
Don't look so hurt all the time,
Alexander. Be a man.

1526
02:28:28,191 --> 02:28:32,361
You count yourself lucky you were here
at all today, after your public display.

1527
02:28:36,199 --> 02:28:38,325
By Herakles, by Zeus, by all the gods...

1528
02:28:38,493 --> 02:28:41,036
...obey me this once!

1529
02:28:42,372 --> 02:28:44,999
Have courage, Father.

1530
02:28:45,166 --> 02:28:47,626
And go on your way
rejoicing that at each step...

1531
02:28:47,794 --> 02:28:50,004
...you may recall your valor.

1532
02:29:25,749 --> 02:29:29,668
And now, our beloved King Philip...

1533
02:29:29,836 --> 02:29:33,047
...in whose honor
these wedding games begin.

1534
02:29:50,899 --> 02:29:53,317
Pausanias, I told you...

1535
02:30:02,452 --> 02:30:03,535
Who's your new friend?

1536
02:30:03,703 --> 02:30:05,454
There's your new friend.

1537
02:30:06,581 --> 02:30:09,124
No! Please, don't! No!

1538
02:31:48,558 --> 02:31:51,185
The king lives!

1539
02:31:51,352 --> 02:31:54,646
Alexander, son of Philip!

1540
02:31:54,814 --> 02:31:57,399
May the gods bless the king!

1541
02:32:01,070 --> 02:32:03,822
Alexander is king!

1542
02:32:06,409 --> 02:32:09,119
You're king now. You're king.

1543
02:32:09,954 --> 02:32:12,623
Long live Alexander!

1544
02:32:14,292 --> 02:32:18,462
- Alexander!
- King Alexander!

1545
02:32:18,630 --> 02:32:22,090
Alexander!

1546
02:32:23,092 --> 02:32:26,094
Alexander is king!

1547
02:32:29,724 --> 02:32:33,101
May the gods bless Alexander!

1548
02:32:34,812 --> 02:32:37,981
May the gods bless the king!

1549
02:32:38,149 --> 02:32:39,942
Alexander!

1550
02:32:57,293 --> 02:33:00,003
You break my heart, you men.

1551
02:33:00,171 --> 02:33:01,964
Afraid.

1552
02:33:03,383 --> 02:33:05,008
Of course you have fears.

1553
02:33:05,176 --> 02:33:06,635
We all have fears...

1554
02:33:06,803 --> 02:33:09,972
...because no one has ever
gone this far before.

1555
02:33:10,473 --> 02:33:14,893
And now we are weeks from
the encircling ocean, our route home.

1556
02:33:15,186 --> 02:33:16,812
We'll build a fleet of ships...

1557
02:33:16,980 --> 02:33:19,982
...and sail all the way
back down the Nile to Egypt.

1558
02:33:20,149 --> 02:33:23,277
And from Alexandria,
we shall be home within weeks.

1559
02:33:23,653 --> 02:33:25,862
There to be reunited with our loved ones.

1560
02:33:26,030 --> 02:33:29,658
To share our great treasures
and tales of Asia.

1561
02:33:29,826 --> 02:33:34,663
And to enjoy our imperishable glory
to the ends of time.

1562
02:33:35,832 --> 02:33:39,334
- Follow Alexander.
- I'll follow you.

1563
02:33:43,965 --> 02:33:45,716
What?

1564
02:33:45,883 --> 02:33:49,177
- Silence?
- We're with you, Alexander!

1565
02:33:49,554 --> 02:33:54,600
Crateros.

1566
02:33:54,767 --> 02:33:56,476
And another one.

1567
02:34:07,947 --> 02:34:09,197
My king.

1568
02:34:09,365 --> 02:34:11,366
I'm a fighting man.

1569
02:34:11,534 --> 02:34:15,454
I don't like no bellyaching.
I won't tolerate it in any of my units.

1570
02:34:16,873 --> 02:34:19,041
I lost many a man.

1571
02:34:20,168 --> 02:34:22,794
Young ones, never been with a woman.

1572
02:34:23,963 --> 02:34:26,131
Some died of disease.

1573
02:34:26,716 --> 02:34:30,927
Some were butchered in Scythia
by the banks of the Oxus.

1574
02:34:31,095 --> 02:34:32,846
Some died good.

1575
02:34:33,014 --> 02:34:36,058
Some just didn't get no luck.

1576
02:34:36,893 --> 02:34:38,602
But they died.

1577
02:34:40,938 --> 02:34:43,857
Forty thousand I come over with
eight years ago.

1578
02:34:44,025 --> 02:34:48,070
And we march after you
more than 10,000 miles.

1579
02:34:49,155 --> 02:34:52,908
In the rain and the sun,
we fought for you.

1580
02:34:53,076 --> 02:34:56,203
Some of us, 50 battles we've been in.

1581
02:34:56,913 --> 02:34:59,331
We killed many a barbarian.

1582
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:05,837
And now when I look around,
how many of them faces do I see?

1583
02:35:06,005 --> 02:35:09,758
Now you want us to fight more
of these crazy monkey tribes east of here.

1584
02:35:09,926 --> 02:35:13,512
We hear talk of thousands
of these elephant monsters...

1585
02:35:13,680 --> 02:35:16,598
...cross a hundred more rivers.

1586
02:35:17,475 --> 02:35:21,603
Crateros. Good Crateros.

1587
02:35:22,438 --> 02:35:27,567
Who better than you to speak,
most noble of men.

1588
02:35:28,611 --> 02:35:32,489
But you know there's no part of me
without a scar or a bone broken.

1589
02:35:32,657 --> 02:35:38,453
By sword, knife, stone, catapult and club.
I've shared every hardship with all of you.

1590
02:35:38,621 --> 02:35:42,040
Aye, you have, my king,
and we love you for it.

1591
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:46,628
But, by Zeus, too many have died.

1592
02:35:47,213 --> 02:35:50,757
You have no children, Alexander,
and we're just...

1593
02:35:50,925 --> 02:35:55,637
...humble men, we seek no disturbance
with the gods. All we wish for...

1594
02:35:55,805 --> 02:36:02,310
...is to see our children and our wives
and our grandchildren one last time...

1595
02:36:02,770 --> 02:36:06,565
...before we join our brothers
in that dark house they call Hades.

1596
02:36:10,486 --> 02:36:14,156
Yes. You're right, Crateros.

1597
02:36:14,323 --> 02:36:15,657
I have been negligent.

1598
02:36:17,827 --> 02:36:20,662
I should've sent you
veterans home sooner, and I will.

1599
02:36:20,830 --> 02:36:23,540
The first of you
shall be the Silver Shields.

1600
02:36:23,708 --> 02:36:28,795
Then every man who's served seven years.
With full pensions from our treasury.

1601
02:36:30,131 --> 02:36:33,759
And respected, rich, loved.

1602
02:36:33,926 --> 02:36:38,805
You'll be treated by your wives and children
as heroes for the rest of your lives...

1603
02:36:38,973 --> 02:36:43,185
...and enjoy a peaceful death.

1604
02:36:44,479 --> 02:36:46,605
But you dream, Crateros.

1605
02:36:47,356 --> 02:36:51,651
Your simplicity long ended when
you took Persian mistresses and children...

1606
02:36:51,819 --> 02:36:56,156
...and you thickened your holdings
with plunder and jewels.

1607
02:36:56,866 --> 02:37:02,204
Because you've fallen in love
with all the things in life that destroy men.

1608
02:37:03,206 --> 02:37:05,540
Do you not see?

1609
02:37:06,709 --> 02:37:10,003
And you, as well as I, know...

1610
02:37:10,171 --> 02:37:14,424
...that as the years decline
and the memories stale...

1611
02:37:14,592 --> 02:37:17,385
...and all your great victories fade...

1612
02:37:17,553 --> 02:37:23,225
...it will always be remembered,
you left your king in Asia!

1613
02:37:23,392 --> 02:37:26,061
For I will go on, with my Asians.

1614
02:37:29,565 --> 02:37:33,860
- To the jackals with you, then, Alexander.
- We come for you, and you discard us.

1615
02:37:34,028 --> 02:37:36,404
- Shame!
- We want to go home, Alexander.

1616
02:37:36,572 --> 02:37:38,323
We're tired of glory.

1617
02:37:38,491 --> 02:37:41,409
We want to see our wives
and children before we die.

1618
02:37:43,412 --> 02:37:45,497
I've got children I haven't even seen.

1619
02:37:49,293 --> 02:37:52,337
I want to see my children.

1620
02:37:52,505 --> 02:37:56,258
I paid for your bastard children.
I've taken nothing for myself.

1621
02:37:56,425 --> 02:37:58,552
And all I've asked of you
is one more month.

1622
02:37:58,719 --> 02:38:00,595
- Shame.
- That's your king.

1623
02:38:01,806 --> 02:38:03,181
What would your father say?

1624
02:38:03,349 --> 02:38:06,518
I've taken you further
than my father ever dreamed.

1625
02:38:06,686 --> 02:38:10,647
So go home. I look to the
barbarians for their courage.

1626
02:38:11,941 --> 02:38:13,525
I go east.

1627
02:38:13,693 --> 02:38:15,735
He wants us dead
so we can't speak of his crimes.

1628
02:38:15,903 --> 02:38:18,113
- Who said that?
- We won't make it to Macedonia.

1629
02:38:18,281 --> 02:38:20,031
You despicable coward. Come forth.

1630
02:38:20,199 --> 02:38:23,118
- Make your accusations public.
- So you can have us killed?

1631
02:38:23,286 --> 02:38:26,288
- Son of Zeus.
- You desecrate your real father's memory.

1632
02:38:26,455 --> 02:38:32,586
- Or did you murder him like you did Cleitus?
- Hide in this mob because I'll take your life.

1633
02:38:42,555 --> 02:38:47,475
You men insult my honor, my paternity.
Arrest him.

1634
02:38:47,643 --> 02:38:51,521
And him. Yes.
And you, this loudmouth Demetrius.

1635
02:38:51,689 --> 02:38:55,317
You call me murderer?
I have no such blood on my hands.

1636
02:38:55,568 --> 02:38:58,653
And him.
Yes, you'll know the pain of treason.

1637
02:38:59,822 --> 02:39:03,825
You mock my shame for Cleitus and say
I'd harm a hair of my father's head.

1638
02:39:04,535 --> 02:39:08,330
Arrest him.
After all I've done for you, you swine.

1639
02:39:08,497 --> 02:39:10,373
You cowards. Traitors.

1640
02:39:12,919 --> 02:39:15,295
Come on, then.
Where are your daggers?

1641
02:39:17,548 --> 02:39:21,801
In smashing the mutiny
and executing the ringleaders...

1642
02:39:21,969 --> 02:39:27,182
...he did nothing, to my mind, that any
general in wartime would not have done.

1643
02:39:27,433 --> 02:39:30,852
But clearly, the army was divided.

1644
02:39:31,812 --> 02:39:35,857
And Alexander was no longer
loved by all.

1645
02:39:38,694 --> 02:39:43,198
He drove on, south to the outer ocean.

1646
02:39:44,867 --> 02:39:47,535
I confess a disappointment.

1647
02:39:47,703 --> 02:39:51,873
Especially on these reports of your
taking on Eastern ways.

1648
02:39:52,041 --> 02:39:57,587
Beware how these manners inflame
the senses with pride.

1649
02:39:58,172 --> 02:40:02,217
However, I have lived long enough now...

1650
02:40:02,385 --> 02:40:04,010
...to question...

1651
02:40:04,178 --> 02:40:09,891
...when so many others invest
such emotion in their disrespect for you.

1652
02:40:10,726 --> 02:40:17,065
I can only hope that you continue
what you began as the boy I knew at 12.

1653
02:40:17,233 --> 02:40:22,112
Be that man always, Alexander,
and you will not slip.

1654
02:40:22,279 --> 02:40:27,325
And perhaps you will prove
this old materialist...

1655
02:40:27,493 --> 02:40:30,245
...as you always thought me:

1656
02:40:30,413 --> 02:40:32,622
A dreamer after all.

1657
02:40:52,852 --> 02:40:54,269
Stay calm.

1658
02:40:54,603 --> 02:40:56,438
Together we are strong as gods.

1659
02:40:58,232 --> 02:41:02,694
Cover with your left,
strike hard with your right.

1660
02:41:06,490 --> 02:41:08,950
Fear is rot. A waste of time.

1661
02:41:14,999 --> 02:41:17,208
Lock shields.

1662
02:41:19,795 --> 02:41:21,963
Battle positions.

1663
02:41:24,050 --> 02:41:25,925
Move.

1664
02:41:34,310 --> 02:41:37,479
Choppers, prepare your knives.

1665
02:41:37,813 --> 02:41:39,439
Follow me.

1666
02:41:51,827 --> 02:41:55,330
Strike hard, boys. Strike hard.

1667
02:42:13,557 --> 02:42:18,061
Come, Macedonians.
Why do you hang back? Hurry.

1668
02:42:18,229 --> 02:42:20,522
Cavalry!

1669
02:42:28,948 --> 02:42:32,283
Split to thirds. Regroup and encircle.

1670
02:42:51,512 --> 02:42:53,054
Hold the line.

1671
02:42:55,808 --> 02:42:56,975
We must die!

1672
02:43:36,765 --> 02:43:42,187
- Oh, no. Cavalry on me.
- Follow Alexander.

1673
02:43:45,774 --> 02:43:49,402
Charge. Charge. Charge.

1674
02:43:52,781 --> 02:43:54,407
The phalanx is in jeopardy.

1675
02:43:54,575 --> 02:43:57,911
Meleager, ride to Pharnakes
and tell him return to the center.

1676
02:43:58,120 --> 02:44:01,915
Find Hephaistion at the riverbank
and bring all cavalry to the center.

1677
02:44:02,124 --> 02:44:05,293
We must reach Crateros
before it's too late.

1678
02:44:28,817 --> 02:44:30,818
Hephaistion. To the center.

1679
02:44:34,740 --> 02:44:37,075
Come, Macedonians. Ride.

1680
02:44:37,368 --> 02:44:39,661
Ride!

1681
02:45:36,135 --> 02:45:38,720
Coenus! Get out of there.

1682
02:45:40,639 --> 02:45:42,140
No.

1683
02:46:12,046 --> 02:46:14,589
- The horses won't go.
- On foot, then.

1684
02:46:21,305 --> 02:46:25,266
Fall back, men! Fall back!

1685
02:46:26,643 --> 02:46:28,102
Come, Bucephalus.

1686
02:46:33,108 --> 02:46:34,984
Fear not, my friend.

1687
02:46:37,488 --> 02:46:39,155
Bucephalus.

1688
02:46:39,323 --> 02:46:41,366
'Tis only sun and shadow.

1689
02:46:44,370 --> 02:46:46,079
Bucephalus and Alexander.

1690
02:46:46,246 --> 02:46:47,747
One last time, it's you and me.

1691
02:46:50,125 --> 02:46:53,628
Isn't it a lovely thing
to live with great courage...

1692
02:46:53,796 --> 02:46:56,255
...and to die leaving an everlasting fame?

1693
02:46:56,924 --> 02:47:00,259
Come, Macedonians.
Why do you retreat?

1694
02:47:00,427 --> 02:47:06,265
Do you want to live forever?
In the name of Zeus, attack.

1695
02:47:22,491 --> 02:47:24,534
Attack.

1696
02:47:25,494 --> 02:47:27,995
Alexander!

1697
02:47:38,924 --> 02:47:40,925
Alexander.

1698
02:49:13,685 --> 02:49:15,394
- The king is down!
- To the king!

1699
02:50:39,730 --> 02:50:43,357
It was the bloodiest of his battles.

1700
02:50:47,237 --> 02:50:49,030
Pure butchery.

1701
02:50:54,578 --> 02:50:56,537
We'd never be men again.

1702
02:52:15,534 --> 02:52:16,909
Get out.

1703
02:52:18,370 --> 02:52:19,829
Go.

1704
02:52:24,584 --> 02:52:27,169
How can you behave
so shamelessly in public?

1705
02:52:27,337 --> 02:52:29,880
Because it was meant to be.

1706
02:52:30,048 --> 02:52:31,882
This isn't how I wanted to become king.

1707
02:52:32,050 --> 02:52:36,053
- No one blames you.
- They blame me behind my back! In secret.

1708
02:52:36,221 --> 02:52:38,305
- Slander is not power.
- Shame is?

1709
02:52:40,809 --> 02:52:42,810
Who killed my father?

1710
02:52:43,311 --> 02:52:44,937
Tell me.

1711
02:52:45,105 --> 02:52:47,857
Tell me, or shall I put you on trial
for his murder?

1712
02:52:48,024 --> 02:52:50,568
- Pausanias.
- He had help!

1713
02:52:50,819 --> 02:52:52,903
Did you help him?

1714
02:52:59,995 --> 02:53:02,288
No, never.

1715
02:53:02,831 --> 02:53:05,666
Why? Why would I?

1716
02:53:06,835 --> 02:53:08,502
So many wanted it.

1717
02:53:08,670 --> 02:53:11,338
Greeks, Persians, men, women.

1718
02:53:11,506 --> 02:53:14,258
I'd be shocked if there were not
a god he had not profaned.

1719
02:53:14,426 --> 02:53:15,968
How ironic though, in the end...

1720
02:53:16,136 --> 02:53:19,597
...a boy he rutted with once too often
returned the favor.

1721
02:53:19,806 --> 02:53:21,766
You're mad. You're cursed.

1722
02:53:21,933 --> 02:53:24,602
You've unleashed Furies,
you don't know their power.

1723
02:53:24,770 --> 02:53:27,688
Now who is exaggerating?

1724
02:53:28,565 --> 02:53:31,400
Even if it was the wish of your heart...

1725
02:53:31,568 --> 02:53:33,736
That's a lie! He was my father!
I loved him!

1726
02:53:33,904 --> 02:53:35,821
He was not your father!

1727
02:53:35,989 --> 02:53:38,073
You owe no blood debt to that man.

1728
02:53:38,241 --> 02:53:41,035
You lie and lie and lie.

1729
02:53:41,203 --> 02:53:44,371
So many lies you've spun
like a sorceress, confusing me.

1730
02:53:44,539 --> 02:53:47,958
Look at you. Look at you.

1731
02:53:48,126 --> 02:53:51,545
You are everything that he was not.

1732
02:53:51,755 --> 02:53:55,049
He was coarse, you are refined.

1733
02:53:55,217 --> 02:53:59,178
He was a general, and you are a king.

1734
02:53:59,346 --> 02:54:01,222
He could not rule himself...

1735
02:54:01,598 --> 02:54:04,725
...and you shall rule the world.

1736
02:54:04,893 --> 02:54:08,604
You're so cursed by all the gods
when you speak like this.

1737
02:54:08,772 --> 02:54:10,856
Such thick pride...

1738
02:54:11,024 --> 02:54:12,733
...and no mourning for your husband.

1739
02:54:12,901 --> 02:54:14,318
Mourn...

1740
02:54:14,486 --> 02:54:16,070
...him?

1741
02:54:17,030 --> 02:54:19,573
What do you know of Philip?

1742
02:54:21,076 --> 02:54:25,371
No, Alexander. Zeus is your father.

1743
02:54:26,081 --> 02:54:29,834
- Act like it.
- My first act would be to kill you!

1744
02:54:31,086 --> 02:54:33,462
You murdered me in my cradle.

1745
02:54:33,630 --> 02:54:35,840
You birthed me in a sack of hate.

1746
02:54:36,007 --> 02:54:38,175
Hate you have for those
stronger than you.

1747
02:54:38,343 --> 02:54:42,263
- Hate you have for men.
- I taught you my heart, Alexander!

1748
02:54:42,430 --> 02:54:45,349
And by Zeus and Dionysus,
you grew beautiful.

1749
02:54:45,517 --> 02:54:47,685
Damn your sorceress soul.

1750
02:54:47,853 --> 02:54:50,521
Your soul is mine, Alexander.

1751
02:54:52,023 --> 02:54:53,566
No! No!

1752
02:54:54,234 --> 02:54:58,112
You've taken from me everything
I've ever loved and made me you!

1753
02:54:58,780 --> 02:55:00,739
Stop it. Stop acting like a boy.

1754
02:55:00,907 --> 02:55:03,450
You're a king. Act like one.

1755
02:55:03,618 --> 02:55:05,286
Parmenion is with us, for once.

1756
02:55:05,453 --> 02:55:07,329
Execute Attalus without delay.

1757
02:55:07,497 --> 02:55:10,291
Confiscate their lands and root out
that family forever.

1758
02:55:10,458 --> 02:55:12,042
Eurydice? Never.

1759
02:55:12,210 --> 02:55:13,627
Laugh, you monster.

1760
02:55:13,795 --> 02:55:15,129
You heartbreaker.

1761
02:55:15,297 --> 02:55:18,215
How will you live out the year like this?

1762
02:55:18,383 --> 02:55:23,137
- Have you learned nothing from Philip?
- No. From you, Mother.

1763
02:55:26,224 --> 02:55:27,933
The best.

1764
02:55:38,111 --> 02:55:42,531
What have I done
to make you hate me so?

1765
02:55:45,243 --> 02:55:49,830
One day, you will understand this.

1766
02:55:49,998 --> 02:55:53,500
But I have only you in my heart.

1767
02:55:56,254 --> 02:55:59,506
I know what you need.

1768
02:56:00,383 --> 02:56:02,593
Now is the time.

1769
02:56:02,844 --> 02:56:05,012
The gods favor you.

1770
02:56:05,430 --> 02:56:08,682
Great wealth, power, conquest.

1771
02:56:08,850 --> 02:56:10,684
All you desire.

1772
02:56:10,852 --> 02:56:13,479
The world is yours!

1773
02:56:13,647 --> 02:56:21,862
Take it.

1774
02:56:44,052 --> 02:56:47,471
He never saw his mother again.

1775
02:56:51,101 --> 02:56:54,395
And while he was away,
fighting the Northern tribes...

1776
02:56:54,562 --> 02:57:00,150
...Olympias had Philip's new wife,
Eurydice, and her infant son murdered.

1777
02:57:00,819 --> 02:57:06,323
By necessity, Alexander
had her uncle Attalus executed.

1778
02:57:46,781 --> 02:57:50,451
He lives! Alexander!

1779
02:58:12,515 --> 02:58:14,725
Men of Macedon...

1780
02:58:15,477 --> 02:58:17,644
...we're going home.

1781
02:58:18,646 --> 02:58:21,023
- What?
- What?

1782
02:58:22,108 --> 02:58:25,235
- Home?
- We're going.

1783
02:58:29,824 --> 02:58:31,825
We're going home.

1784
02:59:38,935 --> 02:59:42,020
His life should have ended in India...

1785
02:59:42,647 --> 02:59:44,106
...but that's myth.

1786
02:59:45,650 --> 02:59:51,071
In life, Herakles died of a poisoned shirt,
given him in error by his jealous wife.

1787
02:59:51,239 --> 02:59:52,573
Great Zeus...

1788
02:59:52,740 --> 02:59:54,992
...we have worshipped you in blood.

1789
02:59:56,119 --> 02:59:58,704
Look kindly on our homeward steps...

1790
02:59:58,872 --> 03:00:03,292
...and smile upon our backs.

1791
03:00:06,337 --> 03:00:11,633
May all those who come here after us
know, when they see this altar...

1792
03:00:11,801 --> 03:00:15,512
...that Titans were once here.

1793
03:00:30,028 --> 03:00:33,780
Making his devotions to the gods
at the end of the great journey...

1794
03:00:33,948 --> 03:00:38,619
...Alexander bade the East farewell
and marched his army directly west...

1795
03:00:38,786 --> 03:00:41,163
...across the great Gedrosian desert...

1796
03:00:41,331 --> 03:00:44,541
...seeking the shortest route home
to Babylon.

1797
03:00:47,378 --> 03:00:52,257
Here, he watched helplessly
the cruel breaking of his army.

1798
03:00:52,425 --> 03:00:54,927
Not by any human foe...

1799
03:00:55,386 --> 03:00:57,638
...but by nature.

1800
03:00:58,890 --> 03:01:03,393
To this day, there is no accounting
of how many died.

1801
03:01:03,561 --> 03:01:06,480
It was the worst blunder of his life.

1802
03:01:08,107 --> 03:01:12,903
And when he finally reentered Babylon,
after six years in the Far East...

1803
03:01:13,071 --> 03:01:18,992
...Alexander again seized the imagination
of the world by taking two more wives.

1804
03:01:19,911 --> 03:01:23,538
Now Alexander had three wives,
two lovers...

1805
03:01:23,706 --> 03:01:26,583
...a contentious mother
and a turbulent Greece...

1806
03:01:26,751 --> 03:01:30,087
...satraps of dubious loyalty
in several provinces...

1807
03:01:30,255 --> 03:01:33,340
...generals questioning his every decision.

1808
03:01:33,508 --> 03:01:39,763
And beneath it all, a restive new army
made u? Of 10 Asians for every Greek...

1809
03:01:39,931 --> 03:01:42,891
...all held together by one slender thread.

1810
03:01:43,059 --> 03:01:46,395
They took another reading.
The harbor can only be dredged to 20 feet.

1811
03:01:46,562 --> 03:01:49,648
Then get a second opinion from
the Phoenicians. It goes deeper.

1812
03:01:49,816 --> 03:01:54,695
Alexander. We're well over 12,000 talents
on wood alone for the fleet.

1813
03:01:55,363 --> 03:01:57,906
And their armor costs are staggering.

1814
03:01:59,033 --> 03:02:01,702
- Cast another dye, we shall back them.
- How?

1815
03:02:01,869 --> 03:02:03,078
Our armor... Our Treasury...

1816
03:02:03,246 --> 03:02:06,123
With our future, Cassander,
the best capital we have.

1817
03:02:06,291 --> 03:02:10,877
Even so, I seriously doubt the Phoenicians
can make a timber quote in time.

1818
03:02:11,045 --> 03:02:14,423
Perhaps we could sail with fewer ships
or delay until the spring...

1819
03:02:14,590 --> 03:02:16,883
There'll be no delays, Nearchus.

1820
03:02:17,051 --> 03:02:21,096
- Ptolemy, how goes our library?
- The trees are falling as we speak.

1821
03:02:21,264 --> 03:02:23,140
Good. We must not forget our libraries.

1822
03:02:24,183 --> 03:02:26,393
All the Alexandrias we have,
I want libraries.

1823
03:02:35,737 --> 03:02:38,572
- Just last night he was...
- It's the water, Your Majesty.

1824
03:02:38,740 --> 03:02:41,116
He mixed it with the wine.

1825
03:02:42,076 --> 03:02:43,702
But how can this be?

1826
03:02:44,078 --> 03:02:47,873
- Typhus of India?
- I wouldn't tax yourself, Your Majesty.

1827
03:02:48,041 --> 03:02:53,378
A few good nights' rest will do it.
But no wine or cold chicken.

1828
03:02:53,546 --> 03:02:55,797
With the regimen of cares
that I've put in place...

1829
03:02:57,008 --> 03:02:58,342
Come, doctor.

1830
03:03:11,356 --> 03:03:13,690
I feel better.

1831
03:03:14,317 --> 03:03:18,028
Soon, I'll be up.

1832
03:03:19,113 --> 03:03:22,532
We leave for Arabia in the spring,
and I couldn't leave without you.

1833
03:03:23,534 --> 03:03:25,869
Arabia.

1834
03:03:28,873 --> 03:03:33,960
You used to dress me up like a sheik...

1835
03:03:34,796 --> 03:03:36,713
...wave your wooden scimitar.

1836
03:03:36,881 --> 03:03:39,966
You were the only one
who'd never let me win.

1837
03:03:41,803 --> 03:03:44,805
The only one who's ever been
honest with me.

1838
03:03:45,306 --> 03:03:48,225
You saved me from myself.

1839
03:03:50,645 --> 03:03:53,814
Please don't leave me, Hephaistion.

1840
03:04:02,490 --> 03:04:06,952
I remember the young man who wanted
to be Achilles...

1841
03:04:07,120 --> 03:04:10,080
...and then outdid him.

1842
03:04:10,248 --> 03:04:12,165
And then what happened?

1843
03:04:12,333 --> 03:04:15,669
Ours is a myth only young men believe.

1844
03:04:16,295 --> 03:04:22,467
- But how beautiful a myth it was.
- We reach, we fall.

1845
03:04:23,845 --> 03:04:26,680
Oh, Hephaistion.

1846
03:04:32,478 --> 03:04:37,858
- I worry for you without me.
- I am nothing without you.

1847
03:04:39,026 --> 03:04:42,112
Come, fight, Hephaistion.

1848
03:04:43,030 --> 03:04:45,532
We will die together.

1849
03:04:48,453 --> 03:04:54,040
We'll have children with our wives, and
our sons will play together as we once did.

1850
03:04:55,001 --> 03:04:58,628
A thousand ships
we'll launch from here, Hephaistion.

1851
03:04:59,338 --> 03:05:04,050
We'll round Arabia
and sail up the gulf to Egypt.

1852
03:05:04,886 --> 03:05:09,389
From there, we'll build a channel through
the desert and out to the Middle Sea.

1853
03:05:09,557 --> 03:05:14,519
And then we'll move on Carthage. And that
great island, Sicily, they'll pay large tribute.

1854
03:05:15,480 --> 03:05:19,399
After that, the Roman tribe,
good fighters. We'll beat them.

1855
03:05:20,443 --> 03:05:22,986
And then explore the northern forests...

1856
03:05:23,154 --> 03:05:26,323
...and out the Pillars of Herakles
to the western ocean.

1857
03:05:26,991 --> 03:05:31,203
And then one day,
populations will mix and travel freely.

1858
03:05:31,370 --> 03:05:34,080
Asia and Europe will come together.

1859
03:05:35,958 --> 03:05:39,878
And we'll grow old, Hephaistion...

1860
03:05:40,588 --> 03:05:46,218
...looking out our balcony
at this new world.

1861
03:05:52,892 --> 03:05:58,146
Hephaistion?

1862
03:05:59,732 --> 03:06:01,858
No!

1863
03:06:05,821 --> 03:06:10,367
- Where is this doctor?
- I can't explain this, Your Majesty.

1864
03:06:10,535 --> 03:06:14,955
- It's not possible. I swear by Apollo.
- Execute him!

1865
03:06:15,873 --> 03:06:18,959
Take him out now and execute him.

1866
03:06:19,418 --> 03:06:23,630
- Come away, come away.
- Liars. Liars. You all hated him. All of you.

1867
03:06:24,298 --> 03:06:27,968
Get out. Get out now!

1868
03:06:36,060 --> 03:06:37,519
Be gone.

1869
03:06:38,646 --> 03:06:43,692
Be gone with you!
Harpies! Get out! Get out!

1870
03:06:43,859 --> 03:06:45,569
Are you drunk again?

1871
03:06:45,736 --> 03:06:47,320
- Get out.
- He's dead.

1872
03:06:47,488 --> 03:06:50,323
- Who?
- Many hated him...

1873
03:06:50,491 --> 03:06:53,326
...but I don't think any other
would have dared.

1874
03:06:54,829 --> 03:06:56,913
Hephaistion is dead?

1875
03:07:01,043 --> 03:07:03,003
Are you mad?

1876
03:07:04,922 --> 03:07:06,464
You monster.

1877
03:07:07,758 --> 03:07:10,844
- Are you mad?
- You've taken from me all I've ever loved.

1878
03:07:11,012 --> 03:07:14,973
May all the Furies through time
damn your miserable heart. Obey me.

1879
03:07:16,017 --> 03:07:20,687
Alexander.
I have your child. Alexander.

1880
03:07:22,189 --> 03:07:25,025
- Alexander, we have a son.
- No.

1881
03:07:26,652 --> 03:07:29,195
- The child.
- Oh, Your Majesty, no.

1882
03:07:29,363 --> 03:07:35,744
Alexander, I have your child.
Alexander, my husband, my king.

1883
03:07:35,911 --> 03:07:38,371
We have a son.

1884
03:07:38,873 --> 03:07:42,208
My poor, poor, ill-fated son.

1885
03:07:43,878 --> 03:07:45,545
Never touch me again.

1886
03:07:48,966 --> 03:07:51,009
No!

1887
03:07:56,599 --> 03:07:59,392
One last toast!

1888
03:08:02,730 --> 03:08:04,606
Before the dawn.

1889
03:08:11,656 --> 03:08:14,824
To my old friends.

1890
03:08:31,842 --> 03:08:35,428
- And to the myths.
- To the myths.

1891
03:09:04,625 --> 03:09:07,961
Yes, come on. Finish it.

1892
03:09:28,983 --> 03:09:31,151
To the next dawn.

1893
03:10:07,521 --> 03:10:09,689
My little Achilles.

1894
03:10:31,337 --> 03:10:34,380
- Bless you, Alexander.
- Lord, we love you.

1895
03:10:35,591 --> 03:10:37,884
Bless you, Alexander.

1896
03:10:45,476 --> 03:10:48,394
My lord, these herbs are from Delphi.

1897
03:10:48,562 --> 03:10:51,189
They saved my brother.

1898
03:10:51,690 --> 03:10:53,399
- Rest yourself.
- Thank you.

1899
03:10:54,568 --> 03:10:56,653
We love you, Alexander.

1900
03:11:02,159 --> 03:11:07,497
Alexander.

1901
03:11:11,752 --> 03:11:14,170
We love you, Alexander...

1902
03:11:15,422 --> 03:11:17,674
...and your seed.

1903
03:11:19,885 --> 03:11:22,095
Keep moving, men, please.

1904
03:11:27,560 --> 03:11:29,853
Yes, come.

1905
03:11:30,020 --> 03:11:36,609
Come to Babylon. I await you.
Your only loving son.

1906
03:11:42,616 --> 03:11:44,158
For the men.

1907
03:11:44,535 --> 03:11:46,119
Bagoas.

1908
03:11:52,459 --> 03:11:55,795
Can you prop me up a little?
It catches me here.

1909
03:12:05,472 --> 03:12:07,640
I've never been so idle.

1910
03:12:07,808 --> 03:12:10,810
The fleet will never get out by spring.
I must go.

1911
03:12:28,495 --> 03:12:30,955
You have given me all.

1912
03:12:32,124 --> 03:12:35,460
- Bagoas.
- And you have given me...

1913
03:12:35,628 --> 03:12:39,172
...the happiest times of my life,
Alexander.

1914
03:12:40,549 --> 03:12:45,136
Happy? What is happy?

1915
03:12:47,306 --> 03:12:50,683
While in your mind and body
are stretched to breaking...

1916
03:12:51,268 --> 03:12:54,228
...you have no thought beyond the next.

1917
03:12:55,481 --> 03:12:58,066
And you look back then...

1918
03:12:58,609 --> 03:13:01,194
...and there it was, happiness.

1919
03:13:02,196 --> 03:13:04,948
In the doing, never the thinking.

1920
03:13:07,201 --> 03:13:12,205
Still, you have made me so happy.

1921
03:13:20,381 --> 03:13:22,882
It is done, Bagoas.

1922
03:13:25,344 --> 03:13:27,220
It is done.

1923
03:13:50,452 --> 03:13:52,704
Wait. We have his son.

1924
03:13:52,871 --> 03:13:56,082
Alexander. Wait.

1925
03:13:57,292 --> 03:13:58,751
Wait.

1926
03:13:59,837 --> 03:14:01,921
Vultures. Wait.

1927
03:14:02,089 --> 03:14:03,756
We have his son.

1928
03:14:04,049 --> 03:14:06,884
Just three more months.

1929
03:14:07,052 --> 03:14:09,012
Please live.

1930
03:14:11,765 --> 03:14:14,434
Alexander, the army will divide.

1931
03:14:14,601 --> 03:14:17,729
Satrapies will revolt.
Without orders, there'll be war.

1932
03:14:17,938 --> 03:14:20,440
We beg you. Tell us who.

1933
03:14:23,277 --> 03:14:25,153
Who will rule this great empire?

1934
03:14:25,320 --> 03:14:29,532
- Who do you want to, Alexander?
- We beg you, tell us.

1935
03:14:30,743 --> 03:14:32,368
The myth becomes real.

1936
03:14:38,208 --> 03:14:40,001
You're terrible.

1937
03:14:46,508 --> 03:14:49,135
All that matters is what you've done.

1938
03:14:49,303 --> 03:14:52,263
Zeus is your father.

1939
03:14:57,561 --> 03:14:58,853
Who will it be?

1940
03:15:00,147 --> 03:15:02,690
Pray tell us, who?

1941
03:15:04,985 --> 03:15:07,653
- What did he say?
- "To the best."

1942
03:15:09,782 --> 03:15:12,200
- He said, "To the best."
- What?

1943
03:15:12,367 --> 03:15:14,577
- No, he said, "To Crateros."
- To Crateros?

1944
03:15:14,745 --> 03:15:16,412
Why would he say Crateros?

1945
03:16:18,976 --> 03:16:23,229
On the 10th of June,
a month short of his 33rd year...

1946
03:16:23,397 --> 03:16:27,859
...Alexander's great heart
finally gave out.

1947
03:16:28,068 --> 03:16:32,238
And as he vowed,
he joined Hephaistion.

1948
03:16:35,409 --> 03:16:38,119
But in his short life,
he achieved, without doubt...

1949
03:16:38,287 --> 03:16:43,624
...the mythic glory
of his ancestor Achilles and more.

1950
03:16:48,589 --> 03:16:51,382
Olympias' transgression
in the murder of his father...

1951
03:16:51,550 --> 03:16:54,385
...is, to my mind, a probability.

1952
03:16:54,553 --> 03:16:57,096
His, a burden.

1953
03:16:58,891 --> 03:17:03,686
Alexander was too in love with glory
for him to steal it.

1954
03:17:07,649 --> 03:17:11,944
But by blood, and blood alone,
he was guilty.

1955
03:17:12,112 --> 03:17:16,449
No!

1956
03:17:24,499 --> 03:17:27,335
- Bolt the doors.
- The body stays in Babylon.

1957
03:17:27,502 --> 03:17:31,380
- The body belongs to Macedon.
- Within hours...

1958
03:17:31,548 --> 03:17:35,134
...we were fighting like jackals
for his corpse.

1959
03:17:35,302 --> 03:17:40,014
The wars of the world had begun.
Forty years, off and on, they endured.

1960
03:17:40,182 --> 03:17:44,435
Cassander in Greece.
Crateros and Antigonus in western Asia.

1961
03:17:44,603 --> 03:17:49,065
Solucas and Perdiccas in the East.
Myself in Egypt.

1962
03:17:49,233 --> 03:17:52,610
Until we divided his empire in four parts.

1963
03:17:52,778 --> 03:17:54,654
Gentlemen, we are not savages.

1964
03:17:54,821 --> 03:17:56,405
- We are the future...
- Get out!

1965
03:17:56,990 --> 03:18:00,326
I think Alexander would have been
disappointed in us.

1966
03:18:03,163 --> 03:18:08,501
Naturally, rumors grew he'd been poisoned
by one faction of his generals or another...

1967
03:18:08,669 --> 03:18:14,090
...but the truth in these matters
has long since been driven from currency.

1968
03:18:16,343 --> 03:18:20,680
Cassander saw to that
with his fake diaries...

1969
03:18:20,847 --> 03:18:25,685
...painting Alexander
as a sick and bloated drunk.

1970
03:18:26,019 --> 03:18:30,648
Many believed,
to remove suspicion from himself.

1971
03:18:33,527 --> 03:18:38,572
He certainly proved he had the temperament
for politics and murder...

1972
03:18:38,740 --> 03:18:43,869
...when seven years later,
he executed Olympias.

1973
03:18:44,871 --> 03:18:48,499
Met her death with great courage.

1974
03:18:49,543 --> 03:18:54,297
Five years...
No, it was six years after that...

1975
03:18:54,464 --> 03:19:00,553
...Cassander finally achieved the complete
destruction of Alexander's bloodline...

1976
03:19:00,721 --> 03:19:03,389
...when he poisoned Roxane...

1977
03:19:03,765 --> 03:19:07,351
...and Alexander's 13-year-old son...

1978
03:19:08,895 --> 03:19:11,731
...the true heir to the empire.

1979
03:19:16,069 --> 03:19:19,572
But Roxane too, like Olympias...

1980
03:19:19,740 --> 03:19:25,494
...played by stern rules,
supported by several generals.

1981
03:19:25,662 --> 03:19:31,542
Days after Alexander's death,
she had Stateira poisoned.

1982
03:19:32,210 --> 03:19:34,170
It was reason enough
for some to believe...

1983
03:19:34,338 --> 03:19:38,132
...she was the one behind
Hephaistion's sudden demise.

1984
03:19:38,300 --> 03:19:41,093
But this is unproven in my mind.

1985
03:19:41,261 --> 03:19:44,513
Bagoas disappeared
from the histories entirely...

1986
03:19:44,681 --> 03:19:47,350
...a wise move, perhaps.

1987
03:19:48,185 --> 03:19:51,479
But I will say his love and devotion
for Alexander...

1988
03:19:53,523 --> 03:19:56,817
...were unquestionable and extraordinary.

1989
03:20:04,117 --> 03:20:08,245
Now I am the keeper of his body...

1990
03:20:08,413 --> 03:20:11,582
...embalmed here in the Egyptian ways.

1991
03:20:12,417 --> 03:20:17,922
I followed him as Pharaoh,
and have now ruled 40 years.

1992
03:20:20,509 --> 03:20:25,638
I have two sons,
each jealous of the other's power.

1993
03:20:28,266 --> 03:20:32,436
But they will grow to make
fine fathers and husbands.

1994
03:20:32,604 --> 03:20:36,774
And I trust they'll be just in their affairs.

1995
03:20:38,318 --> 03:20:41,153
But they have never seen...

1996
03:20:41,321 --> 03:20:44,073
...the great cavalry charge of Gaugamela...

1997
03:20:44,241 --> 03:20:47,493
...or the mountains of the Hindu Kush...

1998
03:20:47,994 --> 03:20:53,499
...when we crossed
a hundred-thousand-man army into India.

1999
03:21:00,674 --> 03:21:03,259
He was a god, Cadmos...

2000
03:21:04,136 --> 03:21:07,054
...or as close as anything
I've ever known.

2001
03:21:07,222 --> 03:21:11,100
"Tyrant!" they yell so easily. I laugh.

2002
03:21:11,268 --> 03:21:13,978
No tyrant ever gave back so much.

2003
03:21:14,146 --> 03:21:16,772
What do they know of the world,
these schoolboys?

2004
03:21:17,399 --> 03:21:19,775
It takes strong men to rule.

2005
03:21:19,943 --> 03:21:26,198
Alexander was more, he was a Prometheus,
a friend to man. He changed the world.

2006
03:21:27,033 --> 03:21:29,952
Before him, there were tribes...

2007
03:21:30,370 --> 03:21:34,665
...and after him, all was possible.

2008
03:21:34,833 --> 03:21:39,545
There was suddenly a sense the world
could be ruled by one king...

2009
03:21:39,713 --> 03:21:41,881
...and be better for all.

2010
03:21:44,217 --> 03:21:47,803
Eighteen great Alexandrias he built
across this world.

2011
03:21:47,971 --> 03:21:53,726
It was an empire, not of land
and gold, but of the mind.

2012
03:21:54,978 --> 03:21:58,147
It was a Hellenic civilization...

2013
03:21:58,315 --> 03:22:02,151
...open to all.

2014
03:22:06,156 --> 03:22:09,825
But the truth is never simple...

2015
03:22:10,702 --> 03:22:12,745
...and yet it is.

2016
03:22:13,246 --> 03:22:16,123
The truth is, we did kill him.

2017
03:22:19,878 --> 03:22:23,255
By silence, we consented.

2018
03:22:23,715 --> 03:22:25,674
Because...

2019
03:22:25,842 --> 03:22:28,385
Because we couldn't go on.

2020
03:22:28,553 --> 03:22:33,807
What, by Ares, did we look forward to
but to be discarded in the end, like Cleitus?

2021
03:22:33,975 --> 03:22:39,271
After all this time, to give away our wealth
to Asian sycophants we despised?

2022
03:22:39,439 --> 03:22:42,650
Mixing the races, harmony?

2023
03:22:43,652 --> 03:22:46,445
Oh, he talked of these things...

2024
03:22:46,613 --> 03:22:52,368
...but wasn't it really about Alexander
and another population ready to obey him?

2025
03:22:53,411 --> 03:22:56,330
I never believed in his dream.

2026
03:22:56,498 --> 03:22:58,582
None of us did.

2027
03:23:00,377 --> 03:23:02,628
That's the truth of his life.

2028
03:23:02,796 --> 03:23:05,422
The dreamers exhaust us.

2029
03:23:06,132 --> 03:23:10,302
They must die before they kill us
with their blasted dreams.

2030
03:23:11,680 --> 03:23:14,557
Oh, just throw all that away, Cadmos.

2031
03:23:14,724 --> 03:23:17,142
It's an old fool's rubbish.

2032
03:23:18,979 --> 03:23:24,316
You shall write, "He died of fever
and a weakened condition."

2033
03:23:25,193 --> 03:23:26,986
Yes, great Pharaoh.

2034
03:23:27,153 --> 03:23:31,073
Oh, he could have stayed home in
Macedonia, married, raised a family.

2035
03:23:32,325 --> 03:23:35,369
He'd have died a celebrated man.

2036
03:23:37,706 --> 03:23:40,499
But this was not Alexander.

2037
03:23:40,917 --> 03:23:46,672
All his life,
he fought to free himself from fear.

2038
03:23:46,840 --> 03:23:53,178
And by this, and this alone,
he was made free.

2039
03:23:54,556 --> 03:23:58,517
The freest man I've ever known.

2040
03:24:00,186 --> 03:24:05,190
His tragedy was one
of increasing loneliness...

2041
03:24:05,358 --> 03:24:09,111
...and impatience with those
who could not understand.

2042
03:24:09,446 --> 03:24:12,156
And if his desire...

2043
03:24:12,324 --> 03:24:17,202
...to reconcile Greek and barbarian
ended in failure...

2044
03:24:19,748 --> 03:24:22,958
What failure!

2045
03:24:23,126 --> 03:24:29,340
His failure towered
over other men's successes.

2046
03:24:33,970 --> 03:24:35,721
I've lived...

2047
03:24:35,930 --> 03:24:38,223
I've lived long life, Cadmos...

2048
03:24:38,391 --> 03:24:40,851
...but the glory
and the memory of man...

2049
03:24:41,019 --> 03:24:45,939
...will always belong to the ones
who follow their great visions.

2050
03:24:46,399 --> 03:24:51,654
And the greatest of these
is the one they now call...

2051
03:24:52,864 --> 03:24:56,742
...Megas Alexandros.

2052
03:24:58,203 --> 03:25:01,413
The greatest of them all.

2053
03:25:02,305 --> 03:26:02,948

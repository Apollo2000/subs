00:06:21,778 --> 00:06:23,529
<i>Listen carefully...</i>

3
00:06:23,738 --> 00:06:25,239
<i>... my son.</i>

4
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,533
<i>By now, Kal-El...</i>

5
00:06:27,742 --> 00:06:32,288
<i>... you are entering the atmosphere
of the planet known as Earth.</i>

6
00:06:32,497 --> 00:06:35,291
<i>I pray you have made a safe journey.</i>

7
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:41,172
<i>The yellow sun of your new home
will give you great physical powers.</i>

8
00:06:41,422 --> 00:06:44,217
<i>But it cannot console your spirit.</i>

9
00:06:45,593 --> 00:06:49,555
<i>Placed aboard this vessel
is an energy module...</i>

10
00:06:49,764 --> 00:06:53,893
<i>... all that remains
of a once-powerful civilization:</i>

11
00:06:54,102 --> 00:06:56,646
<i>Krypton, your mother planet.</i>

12
00:06:56,854 --> 00:06:59,816
<i>It is my last gift to you.</i>

13
00:07:00,358 --> 00:07:05,321
<i>Once removed, the ship will
grow cold and silent...</i>

14
00:07:05,822 --> 00:07:08,950
<i>... and you will be finally alone.</i>

15
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,579
<i>The power in the module
can be used but once.</i>

16
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:18,543
<i>Use it wisely, my son.</i>

17
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:52,159
Clark, you out here?

18
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:54,245
Clark Kent!

19
00:07:54,954 --> 00:07:55,955
Hi, Mr. Hornsby.

20
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:57,123
Over here.

21
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,166
- There you are.
- How are you, sir?

22
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:02,503
- I'm fine, Clark. How are you?
- Nice to see you.

23
00:08:02,712 --> 00:08:04,755
- It's been a long time.
- A long time.

24
00:08:04,964 --> 00:08:07,425
I was tidying up for when
you show the place.

25
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:11,470
Didn't I mention there was
an offer to buy, sight unseen?

26
00:08:11,637 --> 00:08:14,807
I don't want to sell this place
to a big developer.

27
00:08:14,974 --> 00:08:18,811
The buyer has to want a real farm,
not another shopping center.

28
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:21,981
Now darn it, Clark,
why are you so stubborn?

29
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:25,484
Today, nobody wants a farm.

30
00:08:25,693 --> 00:08:29,989
You blink your eye and they'll
all be gone. That's progress.

31
00:08:31,782 --> 00:08:34,201
Oh, my gosh, look at this.

32
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,124
Oh, what a joker
old Jonathan Kent was.

33
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:44,629
You know, I asked him
what happened to the baby's crib.

34
00:08:44,837 --> 00:08:46,422
And he said:

35
00:08:47,173 --> 00:08:51,927
"Oh, little Clark must've had
a bad dream and kicked it."

36
00:08:52,136 --> 00:08:54,555
- I swear, Dad liked a good joke.
- Yeah.

37
00:08:55,598 --> 00:08:59,602
I was wondering, maybe you'd like
to keep these for your grandchildren.

38
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,438
Why, thank you very much, Clark.

39
00:09:03,064 --> 00:09:04,315
Here, batter up.

40
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:05,399
- Oh, no.
- Come on.

41
00:09:05,608 --> 00:09:07,401
- No, really...
- We'll hit a few.

42
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:15,993
Watch out now, these will
come in pretty fast.

43
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,669
You never could hit a curve ball!

44
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,591
That's my final decision
about the place.

45
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,760
I'm holding out for a real farmer.

46
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:34,303
You are?

47
00:09:36,305 --> 00:09:39,308
And you're just as obstinate
as your father was too.

48
00:09:39,475 --> 00:09:41,644
I'm sorry, but that's
just the way it is.

49
00:09:41,852 --> 00:09:44,855
You be careful when you get back
to Metropolis, Clark.

50
00:09:45,856 --> 00:09:48,359
It's a long, long way from
where you were born.

51
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:51,612
Yes, sir. I never forget that, sir.

52
00:09:54,448 --> 00:09:56,659
- Bye.
- Bye, Clark.

53
00:10:14,969 --> 00:10:18,180
What is that God-awful noise
you're making?

54
00:10:18,681 --> 00:10:22,184
Mozart, my low-forehead friend.

55
00:10:22,434 --> 00:10:26,814
Even this wretched pit can't diminish
the spirit of true genius.

56
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:30,359
Life itself started in a murky pit
much like this.

57
00:10:30,943 --> 00:10:34,613
A true genius like myself
learns to seize the moment.

58
00:10:35,114 --> 00:10:36,907
You're the first to know...

59
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:41,579
...that I now have plans
to re-create life itself.

60
00:10:41,912 --> 00:10:46,208
Luthor, start breaking a sweat
or we'll throw you to the wolves.

61
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:48,502
Luthor, let's get them duds dirty.

62
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:51,088
- Move it, meathead.
- Let's see a little sweat.

63
00:10:51,297 --> 00:10:52,715
What's that car doing here?!

64
00:10:52,923 --> 00:10:54,758
Stop that vehicle!

65
00:10:57,094 --> 00:10:59,555
- Hey, stop!
- Hold it there, son.

66
00:11:00,973 --> 00:11:04,977
Yo! Where the hell is this and how
the hell do I get to Cedar City?

67
00:11:05,811 --> 00:11:08,188
You on the wrong side
of the state, boy.

68
00:11:08,397 --> 00:11:10,316
- No chance.
- Oh, no.

69
00:11:12,693 --> 00:11:16,906
You got a fine, fine super-fine
sound system here, son.

70
00:11:17,948 --> 00:11:21,785
I guess you dudes have never seen
one of these Sensurround 100s?

71
00:11:21,994 --> 00:11:24,371
Yeah, I seen one once in a magazine.

72
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,874
Well, heck. Come on, get in.

73
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,500
- Really?
- Come on.

74
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:29,668
Really?

75
00:11:29,835 --> 00:11:32,546
- You wanted to hear it, come on!
- All right.

76
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:35,841
Hop in, Bubba.
Let's give it a listen.

77
00:11:37,635 --> 00:11:38,844
Hey, this is great!

78
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,681
Doors...

79
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,225
What's going on?

80
00:11:45,434 --> 00:11:46,352
Windows...

81
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,022
- What's happening?
- The top.

82
00:11:50,397 --> 00:11:51,357
Seats!

83
00:11:52,941 --> 00:11:55,361
Lordy! Lordy!

84
00:11:55,694 --> 00:11:57,154
And away!

85
00:12:00,616 --> 00:12:02,159
Y'all come back and see us!

86
00:12:02,368 --> 00:12:03,202
Oh, no!

87
00:12:04,286 --> 00:12:05,704
Launch.

88
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,795
All right!

89
00:12:14,296 --> 00:12:16,840
Did I do okay or what, Uncle Lex?

90
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:20,928
Lenny, you've always been the
Dutch elm disease of my family tree.

91
00:12:21,136 --> 00:12:22,554
But this time you did fine.

92
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:29,561
You gonna skip the country, Uncle Lex?

93
00:12:29,853 --> 00:12:31,980
You pathetic product
of the public schools...

94
00:12:32,189 --> 00:12:34,608
...I've had nothing
on my awesome mind...

95
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:37,319
...since I've been incarcerated
except one thing:

96
00:12:37,528 --> 00:12:39,988
- Destroy Superman!
- Destroy Superman!

97
00:12:44,618 --> 00:12:45,744
Sorry.

98
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:02,719
Clark!

99
00:13:36,044 --> 00:13:37,337
Help!

100
00:13:37,546 --> 00:13:39,673
Help! Help!

101
00:13:39,882 --> 00:13:41,884
Somebody get help!

102
00:13:57,482 --> 00:13:58,567
Superman!

103
00:14:22,758 --> 00:14:24,509
He's okay. He needs a doctor.

104
00:14:25,677 --> 00:14:27,095
Superman!

105
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:29,264
Gentlemen, one moment.

106
00:14:29,598 --> 00:14:31,767
I want people to know that
our subway system...

107
00:14:31,975 --> 00:14:35,145
...is the safest and most reliable
means of public transit.

108
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:36,396
Thank you.

109
00:14:40,442 --> 00:14:41,526
Thanks.

110
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,656
You're late, Kent.

111
00:14:46,073 --> 00:14:48,700
Sorry, Mr. White, won't happen again.

112
00:14:49,993 --> 00:14:51,078
Where is everybody?

113
00:14:51,286 --> 00:14:52,371
Boring.

114
00:14:53,997 --> 00:14:55,582
Tedious.

115
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:59,169
- Hey, what's going on?
- Abominable!

116
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:03,465
<i>- Regardez, voil◊ê David Warfield.
- David Warfield...</i>

117
00:15:03,674 --> 00:15:05,550
...who owns those sleazy tabloids?

118
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,597
<i>Au contraire. Who owns all those
sleazy tabloids and The Daily Planet.</i>

119
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:12,474
Tedious.

120
00:15:12,683 --> 00:15:14,267
You only read the pictures?

121
00:15:15,018 --> 00:15:18,855
The fact is, Mr. White,
that I only read the ledger.

122
00:15:19,064 --> 00:15:23,068
A ledger which the previous owners
paid so little attention to...

123
00:15:23,276 --> 00:15:25,320
...I bought the paper from them.

124
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:28,782
<i>The Daily Planet hasn't made
any money in three years.</i>

125
00:15:29,074 --> 00:15:31,493
And the name of the game
is making money.

126
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:36,039
Ladies and gentlemen,
my daughter, Lacy Warfield.

127
00:15:36,248 --> 00:15:38,291
- Thanks, Daddy.
- It's nice to meet you.

128
00:15:39,543 --> 00:15:42,921
Mr. White, Lacy will be helping you.

129
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,132
Helping me? Helping me what?

130
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,968
I have some mock copies
of our new layout.

131
00:15:48,176 --> 00:15:50,178
It's super.

132
00:15:50,387 --> 00:15:52,639
The suit's not right,
but we can change that.

133
00:15:52,848 --> 00:15:54,391
Excuse me, Mr. Warfield.

134
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:59,104
The world isn't really on the brink.
Isn't that headline irresponsible?

135
00:15:59,312 --> 00:16:01,815
Maybe, but it'll sell
a lot of newspapers.

136
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,402
Mr. White, don't do anything rash.

137
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,364
I won't let you turn this grand
old lady into one of your bimbos...

138
00:16:09,573 --> 00:16:14,286
Mr. White, may I point out that Daddy
holds all of your contracts...

139
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:16,580
...which you will have to honor.

140
00:16:16,788 --> 00:16:19,207
<i>Excusez-moi, your spoiled-ness...</i>

141
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,084
Why is Lois speaking French?

142
00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:26,047
...I have a plane to catch to Paris for
the emergency Ministers' Conference...

143
00:16:26,256 --> 00:16:29,176
Not so fast. All trips are canceled.

144
00:16:29,593 --> 00:16:32,262
You mean my trip to Paris is canceled?

145
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:34,639
Mr. White, you come with me.

146
00:16:34,848 --> 00:16:37,642
I want to see your books.
Everyone get back to work.

147
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:40,645
We're not being treated fairly.
I'm speaking to Lacy.

148
00:16:40,854 --> 00:16:41,855
Me too.

149
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:43,565
Excuse me, Miss Warfield.

150
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:47,694
I speak for us all when I say
we'll do our best to cooperate.

151
00:16:48,153 --> 00:16:49,529
Thank you.

152
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:52,574
But a reporter's first allegiance
is to the truth.

153
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:56,578
The people of this city depend on us
and we can't let them down.

154
00:16:57,579 --> 00:16:58,705
Thank you.

155
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:04,920
Is he for real?

156
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,466
100 percent, and I like him that way.

157
00:17:09,674 --> 00:17:11,259
Oh, you have a thing for him.

158
00:17:11,468 --> 00:17:14,137
For Clark?! No!

159
00:17:14,346 --> 00:17:16,223
He's kind of cute.

160
00:17:16,848 --> 00:17:19,226
Look, Miss Warfield...

161
00:17:19,392 --> 00:17:22,854
...Clark is the oldest
living boy scout, okay?

162
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:25,398
He's trustworthy, he's helpful...

163
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:28,276
...he's loyal, he's obedient, he...

164
00:17:28,902 --> 00:17:30,570
I don't know how to tell you this.

165
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:35,450
I just don't think he'd be attracted
to somebody like you.

166
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:40,330
Don't be silly. All men like me.
I'm very, very rich!

167
00:17:41,206 --> 00:17:45,126
Why are there no air travel expenses
for you, Mr. Kent?

168
00:17:45,335 --> 00:17:47,837
I get airsick, especially
when it's bumpy.

169
00:17:48,421 --> 00:17:50,256
Lois, get in here!

170
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:55,095
Lois, explain this column of figures.

171
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,932
- The president is coming on live.
- What, right now?

172
00:17:59,307 --> 00:18:02,060
- It won't be very good news.
- You always overreact.

173
00:18:02,268 --> 00:18:06,523
- It won't be that terrible.
- Hopefully very terrible, Miss Lane.

174
00:18:06,731 --> 00:18:09,776
We can double our circulation
with an international crisis.

175
00:18:09,985 --> 00:18:12,654
<i>And because the summit has failed...</i>

176
00:18:14,072 --> 00:18:17,951
<i>... we have no choice but
to strive to be second to none...</i>

177
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:20,036
<i>... in the nuclear arms race.</i>

178
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:24,833
<i>Therefore, I am announcing
the following measures...</i>

179
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,505
I know you're all upset
by the crisis.

180
00:18:31,214 --> 00:18:35,135
The best thing we can do
is to try to think positively.

181
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:40,348
Now, is there anything we can do?
Doesn't anyone have a suggestion?

182
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:45,520
All right, I'll make a suggestion.

183
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,357
Why don't we write to our congressman?

184
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:53,361
- That'll do a lot of good.
- Somebody has to be an optimist.

185
00:18:54,904 --> 00:18:56,197
Jeremy?

186
00:18:58,241 --> 00:19:02,203
- What could we do about the crisis?
- He doesn't know what's going on.

187
00:19:04,247 --> 00:19:07,208
I know who I'd write a letter to
that would do some good.

188
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:10,837
- Who? Santa Claus?
- No, Superman!

189
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:13,173
Superman, the subject
of our exhibit...

190
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:16,676
...has donated a strand
of his hair to the museum...

191
00:19:16,885 --> 00:19:19,846
...so we can have the fun
of seeing how strong he really is.

192
00:19:20,054 --> 00:19:22,265
Here you see a 1000-pound load...

193
00:19:22,474 --> 00:19:26,019
...easily suspended
by his single hair.

194
00:19:26,227 --> 00:19:30,356
The museum will be closing soon,
so we should hurry a little.

195
00:19:31,483 --> 00:19:34,611
Know what I can do with a single
strand of Superman's hair?

196
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:37,113
You could make a toupee that flies.

197
00:19:38,031 --> 00:19:41,284
That hair is a sample
of Superman's genetic material.

198
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:43,786
The building blocks of his body.

199
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,374
With my genius and enough nuclear
power to mutate the genes...

200
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:51,794
...I can create a being
who's more powerful than him.

201
00:19:53,254 --> 00:19:56,090
With total allegiance to me.

202
00:20:05,016 --> 00:20:07,769
You better stand back.
Keep your eye out.

203
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:42,679
- Miss Warfield, you wanted to see me?
- Hi, Clark. Please come in.

204
00:20:43,263 --> 00:20:45,890
I've come up with a brilliant idea.

205
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:47,558
Oh, really?

206
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:49,477
Well, Daddy thinks it's brilliant.

207
00:20:49,686 --> 00:20:53,648
I want you to write a new series
called "Metropolis After Hours."

208
00:20:53,856 --> 00:20:55,525
Who, me? I...

209
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:58,736
It's wonderful. It's great, isn't it?

210
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:03,032
- I don't think I'd be right for this.
- Oh, you're perfect for it.

211
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:06,911
I mean, you're young, you're single,
you're successful.

212
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,746
I'm usually in bed by 10:30.

213
00:21:08,955 --> 00:21:11,666
That's just it, see, you don't
have to flaunt it.

214
00:21:11,874 --> 00:21:14,627
I mean, you're no slave to fashion.
Although...

215
00:21:14,794 --> 00:21:18,881
...have you ever thought of contacts?
- They make my eyes itch.

216
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,468
Don't worry about it. I thought
we could do this together.

217
00:21:22,677 --> 00:21:25,013
- Oh?
- I know all the right places.

218
00:21:25,221 --> 00:21:27,140
I'm a member of all the right clubs.

219
00:21:27,348 --> 00:21:30,018
We'll start tonight at the opening
of the Metro Club.

220
00:21:30,226 --> 00:21:33,187
- Oh, tonight.
- Yeah, it's a date.

221
00:21:33,354 --> 00:21:34,355
A date!

222
00:21:34,564 --> 00:21:35,565
A date?

223
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:38,443
Well, it's just business, actually.

224
00:21:39,068 --> 00:21:42,363
I've got a letter here for Superman,
care of me.

225
00:21:42,572 --> 00:21:44,657
- What?
- Superman gets mail here?

226
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:47,702
It's probably a picture request.
I can take care of it.

227
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:51,873
I think it's more than just
a fan letter. You should read it.

228
00:21:52,874 --> 00:21:57,420
"Dear Superman, my teacher spoke about
the president's speech on the arms race.

229
00:22:00,047 --> 00:22:02,300
We're all very unhappy about it.

230
00:22:03,217 --> 00:22:07,638
And I said we should get Superman
to rid the world of nuclear arms...

231
00:22:08,765 --> 00:22:10,516
...because only he could do it.

232
00:22:12,685 --> 00:22:17,398
Once you've destroyed all the nuclear
missiles, they'll see I'm right.

233
00:22:17,607 --> 00:22:21,152
Superman can make sure we don't
blow ourselves up, quick and easy.

234
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,447
I know you'll come through.
Your friend, Jeremy."

235
00:22:24,655 --> 00:22:27,825
Poor kid. Oh, well,
I better get back to work.

236
00:22:28,034 --> 00:22:31,829
- No, there's an angle in this.
- An angle! He's just a kid!

237
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:36,834
Daddy loves whipping up campaigns.
Oh, boy, and the public loves it!

238
00:22:37,043 --> 00:22:38,503
Lacy!

239
00:22:39,253 --> 00:22:40,588
We'll make him a celebrity.

240
00:22:40,796 --> 00:22:44,926
Everybody in the world is gonna be
wondering what Superman's reply is.

241
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:50,598
Welcome to Metropolis, Jeremy.

242
00:22:50,806 --> 00:22:54,352
I'm Mr. Warfield and this is
my daughter, Lacy Warfield.

243
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,271
- Hi, Jeremy.
- Now come along and meet the press.

244
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,982
- Don't you trip.
- The car had a flat.

245
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:02,026
Sorry to hear that.
Turn around.

246
00:23:02,235 --> 00:23:04,487
Let everybody get a picture of you.

247
00:23:04,695 --> 00:23:06,906
- That's it, everyone.
- Here, Jeremy.

248
00:23:07,114 --> 00:23:09,617
What a boy! Now come along...

249
00:23:09,825 --> 00:23:12,995
...and tell the American public
what you told me.

250
00:23:13,204 --> 00:23:16,207
I just said I wish Superman
would've said yes.

251
00:23:16,415 --> 00:23:18,084
- Did you get that?
- No, we didn't.

252
00:23:18,292 --> 00:23:20,628
Well, say it again. Loudly.

253
00:23:20,836 --> 00:23:23,965
I just said I wish Superman
would've just said yes!

254
00:23:32,014 --> 00:23:33,099
Miss Lane!

255
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:37,353
Miss Lane. Take a look at this.
Hot off the press.

256
00:23:37,561 --> 00:23:39,480
Oh, my God!

257
00:23:39,689 --> 00:23:43,192
This time he's gone too far.
Look, Clark. Look at that.

258
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:45,528
Can't wait to see
the chief's reaction.

259
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:48,614
I'm through taking it lying down.

260
00:23:49,365 --> 00:23:51,158
Anybody wants me, I'll be downtown.

261
00:23:51,575 --> 00:23:53,369
Chief look different to you?

262
00:23:53,744 --> 00:23:57,581
He looks like my father when he went
to the bank to ask for a loan.

263
00:23:58,082 --> 00:23:59,959
I'm gonna make sure he's all right.

264
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:05,423
There's nothing we can do about it.
It's Superman's decision now.

265
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,259
I'm sure he'll do the right thing.

266
00:24:46,005 --> 00:24:48,507
<i>May the elders watch over you...</i>

267
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,593
<i>... my son.</i>

268
00:24:52,136 --> 00:24:55,681
<i>Their wisdom is all that is left
of a once powerful...</i>

269
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,100
<i>... and enlightened planet.</i>

270
00:24:59,852 --> 00:25:03,481
<i>You must listen to them, Kal-El.</i>

271
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:05,983
<i>Listen.</i>

272
00:25:11,405 --> 00:25:13,783
I know I'm forbidden to interfere.

273
00:25:14,533 --> 00:25:18,913
And yet the Earth is threatened
by the same fate as Krypton's.

274
00:25:19,121 --> 00:25:21,582
The Earth is too primitive.

275
00:25:21,791 --> 00:25:23,918
You can flee to new worlds...

276
00:25:24,376 --> 00:25:27,546
...where war is long forgotten.

277
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:31,383
If you teach the Earth to put
its fate in any one man...

278
00:25:32,051 --> 00:25:35,846
...even yourself, you're teaching them
to be betrayed.

279
00:25:38,849 --> 00:25:41,352
Betrayed... betrayed...

280
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,522
...betrayed... betrayed!

281
00:25:47,191 --> 00:25:50,736
<i>And because the summit has failed...</i>

282
00:25:50,945 --> 00:25:54,198
<i>... we have no choice but to strive...</i>

283
00:25:54,406 --> 00:25:59,328
<i>... to be second to none
in the nuclear arms race.</i>

284
00:25:59,787 --> 00:26:01,247
<i>To that end...</i>

285
00:26:01,455 --> 00:26:04,500
<i>... this administration has pursued...</i>

286
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:07,503
<i>... and will continue to pursue...</i>

287
00:26:07,711 --> 00:26:09,838
<i>... the most vigorous policy.</i>

288
00:26:10,172 --> 00:26:11,590
<i>Therefore...</i>

289
00:26:15,177 --> 00:26:16,262
Just a minute.

290
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:22,935
- Lois?
- There you are. What happened?

291
00:26:23,143 --> 00:26:25,980
- What do you mean, what happened?
- Nothing, just:

292
00:26:26,188 --> 00:26:28,649
"Meet in the lobby at 6 for
the awards dinner.

293
00:26:28,857 --> 00:26:31,110
Wear something nice
and don't be late."

294
00:26:31,318 --> 00:26:35,114
- Was it some other Lois?
- I'm sorry, I completely forgot.

295
00:26:35,322 --> 00:26:38,200
Okay, go get your penguin suit on
and we'll go.

296
00:26:38,701 --> 00:26:43,247
I'd rather not, if you don't mind.
I've got a lot of thinking to do.

297
00:26:43,455 --> 00:26:45,165
But you go ahead. Okay?

298
00:26:48,544 --> 00:26:49,545
Clark?

299
00:26:50,546 --> 00:26:52,381
Something's wrong, isn't it?

300
00:26:55,926 --> 00:27:00,180
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yes, you can, as a matter of fact.

301
00:27:00,389 --> 00:27:03,100
- What?
- Could we go get some fresh air?

302
00:27:05,394 --> 00:27:06,645
Fresh air?

303
00:27:07,062 --> 00:27:09,940
Fresh air. Fresh air, sure.

304
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:11,984
Sure, Clark. Sure.

305
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:14,778
Who needs chicken with
all the fixings anyway?

306
00:27:14,987 --> 00:27:17,531
Let's go. Come on.
Let's get some fresh air.

307
00:27:18,949 --> 00:27:20,993
Breathe. Do you feel better?

308
00:27:22,161 --> 00:27:23,120
Clark?

309
00:27:23,329 --> 00:27:26,081
Clark? Clark, things aren't
that bad! Stop!

310
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,499
Oh, Clark!

311
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,960
Clark! Clark!

312
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,971
Superman!

313
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,409
You okay?

314
00:28:02,826 --> 00:28:03,952
Great.

315
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,798
Hey, look at that.

316
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:29,019
There you go. Bye-bye!

317
00:28:59,508 --> 00:29:02,469
- How'd you like going solo?
- I loved it.

318
00:29:02,678 --> 00:29:04,638
But not as much as being with you.

319
00:29:04,847 --> 00:29:07,724
I needed to be with you too.
You make me laugh.

320
00:29:11,687 --> 00:29:13,897
You're the only one
I can talk to, Lois.

321
00:29:14,273 --> 00:29:18,735
See, sometimes I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

322
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:23,615
I'm always here for you, you know that.

323
00:29:24,199 --> 00:29:27,786
And you'll do the right thing,
no matter what. You always have.

324
00:29:28,328 --> 00:29:29,454
Thank you.

325
00:29:30,664 --> 00:29:32,457
- You know something?
- What?

326
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:36,753
- You don't even know my name.
- Kal-El.

327
00:29:39,172 --> 00:29:40,757
You remember, don't you?

328
00:29:42,092 --> 00:29:43,719
I remember everything.

329
00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:48,890
"Never set one of them above the rest.
Love all humanity instead."

330
00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:53,604
That's not fair.

331
00:30:20,464 --> 00:30:21,298
Lois.

332
00:30:21,882 --> 00:30:24,468
Lois, it's time to go. We'll be late.

333
00:30:27,304 --> 00:30:30,140
What am I doing out here
freezing my butt off?

334
00:30:30,349 --> 00:30:33,143
Oh, you wanted some fresh air.

335
00:30:33,894 --> 00:30:37,272
Oh, no that's okay.
I don't want to catch a cold.

336
00:30:37,481 --> 00:30:41,860
I feel kind of weird,
like I'm jetlagged or something.

337
00:30:42,069 --> 00:30:44,029
- Jeepers!
- Like I'm going crazy.

338
00:30:45,822 --> 00:30:50,202
- How about you? Are you still down?
- Nope. Things are pretty clear.

339
00:30:50,744 --> 00:30:54,539
Good. Too much thinking
wears down your batteries.

340
00:30:56,291 --> 00:31:00,504
Clark, you gotta go with your gut.

341
00:31:00,962 --> 00:31:02,130
Come on.

342
00:31:07,135 --> 00:31:08,637
Okay, here you go, Jeremy.

343
00:31:09,137 --> 00:31:12,516
Mr. Warfield wants me to get shots
of you with local color...

344
00:31:12,724 --> 00:31:14,476
...but I can't think of anything.

345
00:31:16,144 --> 00:31:18,146
- Hi, Jeremy.
- Superman!

346
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,065
Jimmy.

347
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:21,983
What a scoop!

348
00:31:23,527 --> 00:31:25,654
- How'd you like to take a walk?
- Sure!

349
00:31:25,862 --> 00:31:27,447
Jimmy, come on.

350
00:31:41,711 --> 00:31:43,588
You can't! You'll get towed.

351
00:31:44,923 --> 00:31:47,259
Do you know how much
a ticket costs?

352
00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:49,010
Lacy, it's only money.

353
00:31:57,894 --> 00:32:00,522
Will you wait for me
upstairs in the gallery?

354
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:01,690
Sure, okay.

355
00:32:01,898 --> 00:32:04,067
- Good luck, Superman.
- Thanks.

356
00:32:13,285 --> 00:32:14,578
I saved you a seat.

357
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,376
All right, Superman!

358
00:32:24,462 --> 00:32:27,924
I don't represent any country but
I'd like to address the delegates.

359
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:32,137
Well, in that case,
you will need a sponsor.

360
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:37,267
I believe that will do. Please.

361
00:32:41,271 --> 00:32:42,355
Thank you.

362
00:32:44,649 --> 00:32:46,109
What's he gonna say?

363
00:32:46,818 --> 00:32:48,612
Something wonderful.

364
00:32:49,779 --> 00:32:51,281
Madam Secretary...

365
00:32:51,906 --> 00:32:55,368
...honorable delegates,
ladies and gentlemen.

366
00:32:55,577 --> 00:32:58,622
For many years now
I've lived among you as...

367
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:02,667
...a visitor. I've seen
the beauty of your many cultures.

368
00:33:03,335 --> 00:33:06,046
I've felt joy in your magnificent
accomplishments.

369
00:33:07,005 --> 00:33:09,341
I've also seen the folly of your wars.

370
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,179
As of today I'm not a visitor
anymore, because the Earth...

371
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,806
...is my home too.

372
00:33:17,724 --> 00:33:20,435
We can't live in fear.
And I can't stand...

373
00:33:20,644 --> 00:33:24,147
...idly by and watch us
stumble into the madness...

374
00:33:24,356 --> 00:33:26,358
...of possible nuclear destruction.

375
00:33:26,983 --> 00:33:28,360
I've come to a decision.

376
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:32,697
I'm going to do what our governments
have been unwilling to do.

377
00:33:33,365 --> 00:33:38,119
Effective immediately, I'm going to
rid our planet of all nuclear weapons.

378
00:33:39,996 --> 00:33:41,748
All right, Superman!

379
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:46,836
Way to go, Superman!

380
00:34:03,645 --> 00:34:05,772
Missile test Alpha, all systems go.

381
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,608
<i>- Three... two... one.</i>

382
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:58,843
Oh!

383
00:35:59,052 --> 00:36:01,596
Oh. Nice to see you guys!

384
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,935
Why don't you just relax there.
I'll get on with the introductions:

385
00:36:08,144 --> 00:36:09,270
Dixie.

386
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:11,272
And Trixie.

387
00:36:14,025 --> 00:36:18,655
From the land of the free, the home of
the great cost overrun, Harry Howler:

388
00:36:19,155 --> 00:36:22,450
Nuclear strategist from
America's top think tank.

389
00:36:22,659 --> 00:36:25,203
And a great little warmonger
in his own right.

390
00:36:25,411 --> 00:36:27,914
<i>A hearty bienvenue
to Jean-Pierre Dubois:</i>

391
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,417
Nuclear warhead dealer to the world.

392
00:36:31,876 --> 00:36:33,461
His motto is:

393
00:36:33,878 --> 00:36:36,172
"If you didn't buy it
from Jean-Pierre...

394
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:38,549
...you didn't buy it
on the black market."

395
00:36:39,634 --> 00:36:41,094
General Romoff.

396
00:36:41,928 --> 00:36:44,722
A lot of people think of you
as the "Mad Russian."

397
00:36:45,723 --> 00:36:49,602
I like to think of you
as just madly eccentric.

398
00:36:49,811 --> 00:36:51,270
Please be seated.

399
00:36:53,564 --> 00:36:57,443
Look guys. I know you're all choked
up, kind of overcome with joy...

400
00:36:57,652 --> 00:37:00,405
...that Superman has ended
the arms race.

401
00:37:01,948 --> 00:37:05,535
But if we work together,
we can make the world safe...

402
00:37:05,743 --> 00:37:07,078
...for war profits.

403
00:37:07,495 --> 00:37:08,579
Get to the point.

404
00:37:08,913 --> 00:37:12,542
The point is, I, Lex Luthor, greatest
criminal mind of the modern era...

405
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,002
...have found a way
to destroy Superman.

406
00:37:15,253 --> 00:37:17,880
Behold, my unscrupulous friends...

407
00:37:20,425 --> 00:37:21,759
Shut those blinds.

408
00:37:21,926 --> 00:37:25,555
- The sun is hurting my eyes!
- Exactly.

409
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,473
You know what the sun is?

410
00:37:27,682 --> 00:37:30,476
It's nothing more than
a huge nuclear bomb...

411
00:37:30,685 --> 00:37:35,314
...a bomb with so much radiation, it'd
incinerate the average man like that!

412
00:37:36,023 --> 00:37:39,110
Yes, but Superman is no average man.

413
00:37:39,402 --> 00:37:41,112
Aha, right!

414
00:37:42,447 --> 00:37:43,948
What is your plan?

415
00:37:44,615 --> 00:37:48,494
Boys, old Lex here
has kind of a secret recipe...

416
00:37:48,703 --> 00:37:52,498
...a genetic stew in this dish,
if you will.

417
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:55,960
If you'll help me put this
on one of your missiles...

418
00:37:56,169 --> 00:38:00,798
...I promise you, Superman will have
the biggest surprise of his life.

419
00:38:01,424 --> 00:38:05,469
I'll introduce him to his first
nightmare, a "Nuclear Man."

420
00:38:05,678 --> 00:38:10,016
He'll pierce his skin. He'll make
him mortal. He'll become sick.

421
00:38:10,224 --> 00:38:12,185
We'll dance on his grave.

422
00:38:12,685 --> 00:38:16,105
Why should we deal with
a notorious scoundrel like you?

423
00:38:16,355 --> 00:38:17,523
Remember my motto:

424
00:38:17,732 --> 00:38:20,568
"The more fear you make,
the more loot you take."

425
00:38:20,776 --> 00:38:22,820
And the more missiles you guys sell...

426
00:38:23,029 --> 00:38:26,532
Yes, but what's in it for you?

427
00:38:28,743 --> 00:38:30,620
A tiny commission.

428
00:38:31,537 --> 00:38:33,039
Something appropriate.

429
00:38:34,957 --> 00:38:36,250
A number...

430
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:39,170
...with a lot of zeros behind it.

431
00:38:46,552 --> 00:38:47,762
Lenny.

432
00:38:48,429 --> 00:38:50,222
The new genetic material.

433
00:38:52,975 --> 00:38:54,518
And now, Leonard...

434
00:38:55,227 --> 00:38:56,812
...your Uncle Lex...

435
00:38:57,021 --> 00:39:01,567
...with this protoplasm that I have
grown from Superman's hair cells...

436
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:05,696
...will duplicate creation itself.

437
00:39:07,365 --> 00:39:08,783
Now the fabric.

438
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:13,579
Uncle Lex, this ain't gonna cover him.

439
00:39:15,873 --> 00:39:18,417
The computer inside will...

440
00:39:19,377 --> 00:39:23,005
...leave enough material to maintain
the high moral standards...

441
00:39:23,214 --> 00:39:26,634
...that I've always subscribed to.

442
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:28,678
Know what this means, Uncle Lex?

443
00:39:29,095 --> 00:39:30,137
What?

444
00:39:30,346 --> 00:39:31,931
We're gonna be parents.

445
00:40:02,461 --> 00:40:04,797
- What's your name, sergeant?
- York, sir.

446
00:40:05,005 --> 00:40:06,173
At ease.

447
00:40:38,247 --> 00:40:40,249
Launch control. Yes, sir.

448
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:42,251
Yes, sir.

449
00:40:42,835 --> 00:40:45,379
There's a weather problem.
We gotta hold.

450
00:40:45,963 --> 00:40:47,173
Hold?

451
00:40:47,673 --> 00:40:49,633
- What's your name, son?
- Goram.

452
00:40:49,842 --> 00:40:51,135
"Goram, sir."

453
00:40:51,343 --> 00:40:53,721
- Goram, sir.
- Goram, you know your code book?

454
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:55,222
Of course, sir.

455
00:40:55,431 --> 00:40:59,602
27-0-6, inclement override.
Fire on my command. Fire.

456
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:02,396
Yes, sir. Stand by to launch.

457
00:41:04,356 --> 00:41:06,025
Ten... nine...

458
00:41:19,496 --> 00:41:20,456
Missed us.

459
00:42:38,784 --> 00:42:40,411
Reach out.

460
00:42:40,953 --> 00:42:42,496
Come on.

461
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,790
Down.

462
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:46,625
Reach out.

463
00:42:46,834 --> 00:42:49,128
And stretch.

464
00:42:49,294 --> 00:42:50,587
Down.

465
00:42:51,046 --> 00:42:52,339
Up.

466
00:42:52,756 --> 00:42:55,843
- Clark, are you okay?
- I think I better sit this one out.

467
00:42:56,051 --> 00:42:59,972
You sure? This would be great for
your series on the young Metropolis.

468
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,099
Let's try it again. Come on.

469
00:43:02,307 --> 00:43:05,018
Two, three, four.

470
00:43:05,227 --> 00:43:08,188
One, two, three.

471
00:43:08,397 --> 00:43:11,608
- I don't think so.
- What, are you okay?

472
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:21,285
28.

473
00:43:21,493 --> 00:43:22,536
29.

474
00:43:22,786 --> 00:43:24,079
23.

475
00:43:24,496 --> 00:43:27,374
- Done. Great.
- Okay, you try it now.

476
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:31,920
- Let's set it a little higher for you.
- Okay.

477
00:43:32,254 --> 00:43:33,839
Just push down.

478
00:43:37,801 --> 00:43:41,388
- Are you okay? Just step down.
- Need some help?

479
00:43:42,973 --> 00:43:45,184
Your friend doesn't know
his own strength.

480
00:43:45,392 --> 00:43:47,019
Clark, this is Paul.

481
00:43:47,227 --> 00:43:49,062
- He's a trainer here.
- Hi.

482
00:43:49,271 --> 00:43:51,523
Hey, I got just the thing for you.

483
00:43:51,899 --> 00:43:53,609
Over here, Clarky.

484
00:43:54,026 --> 00:43:55,235
Clarky?

485
00:43:59,573 --> 00:44:01,742
It's real nice of him to help me out.

486
00:44:02,117 --> 00:44:04,453
- He's really good.
- Here, try this one.

487
00:44:04,661 --> 00:44:07,915
Clark! Are you okay? Sorry.

488
00:44:08,123 --> 00:44:09,791
No pain, no gain.

489
00:44:11,627 --> 00:44:13,837
Jeez, what a jerk.

490
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,632
Never realized it before.

491
00:44:17,174 --> 00:44:19,551
I guess a lot of people
I know are jerks.

492
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,138
Maybe you think I'm one too.
That's why you keep avoiding me.

493
00:44:23,514 --> 00:44:26,892
Oh, no, I don't think that at all.
Just been really busy, that's all.

494
00:44:28,018 --> 00:44:29,019
But wait.

495
00:44:29,228 --> 00:44:33,815
You know Lois is doing that interview
with Superman about his peace mission.

496
00:44:34,066 --> 00:44:38,278
Well, I was thinking the four of us
can get together and have high tea.

497
00:44:38,487 --> 00:44:39,988
It's very chic.

498
00:44:40,155 --> 00:44:43,116
- Can you hand me those weights, Clark?
- Excuse me.

499
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,160
Wait a minute, Lacy.

500
00:44:45,661 --> 00:44:49,957
Come early. The view is so romantic
from my balcony. See you.

501
00:44:50,832 --> 00:44:54,461
- Oh, sure. Here.
- Not those! The other one!

502
00:44:56,255 --> 00:44:57,464
No pain, no gain?

503
00:45:07,724 --> 00:45:08,433
What was that?

504
00:45:11,728 --> 00:45:15,357
Uncle Lex...
You're spooking me out.

505
00:45:17,693 --> 00:45:18,819
There.

506
00:45:21,071 --> 00:45:24,032
Madam, thank you very much.

507
00:45:48,348 --> 00:45:49,641
I'm incredible.

508
00:45:52,269 --> 00:45:53,645
Uncle Lex, he's like...

509
00:45:55,647 --> 00:45:57,607
He's beautiful. He's perfect.

510
00:45:59,317 --> 00:46:01,278
Welcome home, Nuclear Man.

511
00:46:01,778 --> 00:46:04,031
Your father's happy to see you.

512
00:46:19,629 --> 00:46:23,175
The power of the sun has given him
internally generated heat.

513
00:46:26,428 --> 00:46:27,721
I'm a...

514
00:46:28,346 --> 00:46:29,765
You are...

515
00:46:30,849 --> 00:46:34,394
I'm... What? I'm a genius?

516
00:46:34,603 --> 00:46:36,605
I'm incredible. I'm...

517
00:46:37,189 --> 00:46:39,149
You are nothing.

518
00:46:39,691 --> 00:46:41,359
I am the father now.

519
00:46:41,651 --> 00:46:42,611
You have my voice.

520
00:46:43,111 --> 00:46:45,864
No, you have my voice.

521
00:46:46,907 --> 00:46:48,450
Just remember, I made you.

522
00:46:48,825 --> 00:46:51,703
Yeah, you're just an experiment,
freako.

523
00:46:54,206 --> 00:46:55,373
What is that?

524
00:46:55,957 --> 00:47:00,003
- Oh, no.
- I'm an experiment. I'm a freako.

525
00:47:00,837 --> 00:47:03,298
I was just kidding about
that freako line!

526
00:47:03,507 --> 00:47:06,551
If anybody's a freako around here,
it's gotta be me!

527
00:47:09,262 --> 00:47:11,473
Oh, wow, I'm break dancing, hey!

528
00:47:11,681 --> 00:47:13,558
This rocks. Hey!

529
00:47:16,478 --> 00:47:18,104
I made you. I can destroy you.

530
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,023
Destroy.

531
00:47:20,524 --> 00:47:22,567
Destroy Superman now.

532
00:47:22,984 --> 00:47:26,279
You sweet thing.
But not quite yet, no.

533
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:30,992
Come here. We'll discuss
when the proper time is.

534
00:47:37,707 --> 00:47:38,959
Uncle Lex.

535
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:46,967
Oh, no!

536
00:47:47,217 --> 00:47:50,136
He's, like... He's, like, cold.

537
00:47:50,345 --> 00:47:51,846
Of course he is.

538
00:47:52,847 --> 00:47:56,643
That's his vulnerability. That's
the only way he can be stopped.

539
00:47:56,851 --> 00:47:57,978
What?

540
00:47:59,104 --> 00:48:03,525
Lenny, my loud-mouthed nephew,
he gets his energy from the sun.

541
00:48:03,858 --> 00:48:06,111
Without it, he's like you at night:

542
00:48:06,736 --> 00:48:07,570
Useless.

543
00:48:22,127 --> 00:48:23,336
Well, nobody's perfect.

544
00:48:29,884 --> 00:48:33,847
I never had a double date before.
This is fun. How do I look?

545
00:48:35,181 --> 00:48:39,394
Illegal. Like the last six dresses
you tried on.

546
00:48:39,602 --> 00:48:43,857
Listen, Lacy? I don't want to
burst your bubble or anything but...

547
00:48:44,065 --> 00:48:46,401
...Clark's not gonna notice
what you're wearing.

548
00:48:46,568 --> 00:48:48,361
Yes, he will. There's Clark.

549
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:51,281
Okay, fix that. There you go.
You look great.

550
00:48:51,489 --> 00:48:54,534
- Maybe it's just Superman.
- No.

551
00:48:55,076 --> 00:48:59,205
No, Superman makes a different
kind of entrance.

552
00:49:10,383 --> 00:49:12,093
- Hi, Lacy.
- Hi, Clark.

553
00:49:12,302 --> 00:49:14,888
Can you break a 20?
Driver didn't have any change.

554
00:49:15,346 --> 00:49:17,640
Yeah, sure. Let me get my purse.

555
00:49:17,849 --> 00:49:19,809
- Hi, Lois.
- Hi, Clark.

556
00:49:20,101 --> 00:49:20,935
- Clark.
- What?

557
00:49:21,144 --> 00:49:23,730
You are not gonna believe
this list of questions...

558
00:49:23,938 --> 00:49:26,483
...Mr. Warfield gave me
to ask Superman. Look.

559
00:49:27,192 --> 00:49:30,737
"Aren't you part of a plot
to weaken our national defense?"

560
00:49:30,945 --> 00:49:33,448
- Oh, my goodness.
- I think his gray matter is...

561
00:49:33,656 --> 00:49:37,076
- How will I ask him these questions?
- Well, politely I guess.

562
00:49:37,285 --> 00:49:40,914
Let's see, I have 18 dollars and...

563
00:49:41,247 --> 00:49:45,001
Clark, she really likes you,
so notice the dress.

564
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,086
...my American Express card.

565
00:49:47,295 --> 00:49:49,672
- Dress.
- Oh, hey, neat dress.

566
00:49:50,215 --> 00:49:51,925
Well, thanks. Be right back.

567
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,096
What's that?

568
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:01,851
Now, there's a different
kind of entrance.

569
00:50:05,772 --> 00:50:07,148
- Hi, Lois.
- Hello, Superman.

570
00:50:07,357 --> 00:50:08,608
How are you?

571
00:50:09,067 --> 00:50:10,360
I'm fine.

572
00:50:11,569 --> 00:50:15,698
Oh, Superman, this is Lacy Warfield.
She's the boss' daughter.

573
00:50:15,907 --> 00:50:18,284
How do you do?
That's a very attractive outfit.

574
00:50:18,493 --> 00:50:21,955
- I think we better start our interview.
- Excuse me.

575
00:50:22,163 --> 00:50:23,665
Two's company.

576
00:50:24,249 --> 00:50:27,126
Oh, right, yeah.
Yeah, I'll go get Clark.

577
00:50:28,711 --> 00:50:33,508
He's probably helping the driver
change a tire, or some other good deed.

578
00:50:33,716 --> 00:50:34,551
That guy.

579
00:50:36,094 --> 00:50:38,721
- Something smells wonderful.
- Oh, thank you.

580
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:41,516
I'm cooking some scallops
and some duck...

581
00:50:41,724 --> 00:50:45,228
...in this wonderful mushroom sauce
with champagne.

582
00:50:45,436 --> 00:50:47,772
In case we got hungry afterwards.

583
00:50:48,189 --> 00:50:49,816
I mean, later.

584
00:50:50,567 --> 00:50:52,735
You shouldn't have gone
to all that trouble.

585
00:50:59,242 --> 00:51:01,494
Should we get on with the interview?

586
00:51:01,703 --> 00:51:04,831
Yes, let's. Let's get on
with the interview.

587
00:51:08,668 --> 00:51:13,590
Have you had any trouble
confiscating the missiles?

588
00:51:14,007 --> 00:51:17,051
There always was the possibility
that warped individuals...

589
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:20,096
...would take advantage of
the world's goodwill, but...

590
00:51:21,973 --> 00:51:23,433
Is there something wrong?

591
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:30,023
Oh! My dinner! My dinner!

592
00:51:30,189 --> 00:51:31,941
I'll be right back.

593
00:51:32,442 --> 00:51:33,735
Be right back.

594
00:51:46,414 --> 00:51:47,248
Hi.

595
00:51:47,457 --> 00:51:50,418
- I missed you, Clark.
- Oh. Ah, well...

596
00:51:50,626 --> 00:51:54,422
It's so boring with Lois and Superman.
Let's do something wild.

597
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:57,258
Gee, they're expecting us.
It wouldn't be polite.

598
00:51:57,467 --> 00:51:59,010
Yeah, you're right.

599
00:51:59,886 --> 00:52:03,264
How can one man be so square
and so delicious?

600
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:08,728
All right, let's go chitchat. If I
have to face Superman, so do you.

601
00:52:09,645 --> 00:52:10,646
Lacy?

602
00:52:12,648 --> 00:52:14,233
Oh, Clark.

603
00:52:15,318 --> 00:52:16,402
Stop!

604
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:40,426
I don't believe it! I never had duck
turn out so perfectly. It's amazing!

605
00:52:40,635 --> 00:52:41,594
I'm out here, Lois.

606
00:52:41,969 --> 00:52:43,096
Oh.

607
00:52:56,651 --> 00:52:59,987
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yes, it is beautiful.

608
00:53:01,072 --> 00:53:02,865
The whole world is beautiful.

609
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:08,538
I've always felt moments like this
should be shared with someone you...

610
00:53:10,039 --> 00:53:11,999
Someone you care a lot about.

611
00:53:14,418 --> 00:53:16,003
Isn't that the doorbell?

612
00:53:16,879 --> 00:53:17,964
Yes.

613
00:53:34,605 --> 00:53:35,857
Lacy!

614
00:53:37,483 --> 00:53:38,317
Where's Clark?

615
00:53:38,526 --> 00:53:40,695
He started to get in the elevator...

616
00:53:40,903 --> 00:53:43,197
Oh, never mind, it's a long story.

617
00:53:43,406 --> 00:53:45,533
It always is with Clark.

618
00:53:46,576 --> 00:53:48,202
Oh, great, that's him.

619
00:53:50,788 --> 00:53:52,081
- Clark?
- Hi.

620
00:53:52,248 --> 00:53:54,709
Those bellboys ought to
look where they're going.

621
00:53:54,917 --> 00:53:56,502
Superman?

622
00:53:56,794 --> 00:54:00,089
- I'm so glad you're back.
- Is dinner ready? Can we eat?

623
00:54:00,298 --> 00:54:02,592
- Yeah, let's go sit down.
- Oh, great.

624
00:54:07,263 --> 00:54:09,307
- Sorry!
- My goodness! No, that's okay.

625
00:54:09,515 --> 00:54:12,602
Just leave it there, Clark.
It's stuck on your pants.

626
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:16,147
Yeah, let me just get a rag.
Excuse me, be right back.

627
00:54:20,526 --> 00:54:21,611
Where's Clark?

628
00:54:24,155 --> 00:54:27,992
<i>Hello, Dolly
Hello, Dolly</i>

629
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:32,204
<i>It's so nice to have me back
Where I belong</i>

630
00:54:33,331 --> 00:54:36,667
<i>Don't be concerned, Blue Boy.
You're the only one who can hear me.</i>

631
00:54:36,876 --> 00:54:40,171
<i>It's my own private frequency.
You might call it "Lex TV."</i>

632
00:54:40,755 --> 00:54:43,507
<i>Look to your left,
tall, dark and handsome.</i>

633
00:54:44,425 --> 00:54:49,221
<i>I'm gonna blow 20 stories off that
building, give or take a floor or two.</i>

634
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:50,514
<i>Peace.</i>

635
00:54:52,099 --> 00:54:53,225
Men.

636
00:54:53,434 --> 00:54:55,478
I hope Clark's okay. I better look.

637
00:54:55,686 --> 00:54:56,854
Okay.

638
00:55:00,024 --> 00:55:04,236
I'm sorry, but an emergency's come up.
My apologies to Miss Warfield.

639
00:55:04,445 --> 00:55:05,654
Oh, but...

640
00:55:05,905 --> 00:55:09,700
Superman! Take me with you!
I can cover the story!

641
00:55:11,702 --> 00:55:13,162
You seen Clark?

642
00:55:22,622 --> 00:55:25,833
Guess who. It's your old friend Lex.

643
00:55:26,959 --> 00:55:31,506
I suspect if you'd actually planted
a bomb, you'd be miles away by now.

644
00:55:32,381 --> 00:55:34,133
This is my nephew Lenny.

645
00:55:34,342 --> 00:55:35,593
He worships me.

646
00:55:35,802 --> 00:55:40,056
The dude of steel.
Boy, are you gonna get it!

647
00:55:41,516 --> 00:55:45,770
Silly me, thinking that
I could fool a super guy.

648
00:55:45,978 --> 00:55:48,397
You're right. No bomb.

649
00:55:48,606 --> 00:55:52,109
It's just that you're so involved
in this world peace bit...

650
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:54,695
...you don't have time
for social calls.

651
00:55:55,154 --> 00:55:57,949
I confess, I tricked you.

652
00:55:58,366 --> 00:55:59,283
You look great.

653
00:55:59,492 --> 00:56:02,870
Never mind the small talk.
What are you up to?

654
00:56:04,038 --> 00:56:05,748
You know you're a workaholic?

655
00:56:05,957 --> 00:56:08,793
You're playing a good guy
24 hours a day.

656
00:56:09,001 --> 00:56:11,170
Why don't you stop and
smell the roses?

657
00:56:11,379 --> 00:56:14,549
Get yourself a hobby? A pet?
A kitten, a puppy?

658
00:56:14,757 --> 00:56:19,136
I know you hate children and animals.
What are you doing back in Metropolis?

659
00:56:19,345 --> 00:56:23,808
I want to be first to introduce
you to the new kid on the block.

660
00:56:37,446 --> 00:56:39,782
Look closely at the cell structure.

661
00:56:40,283 --> 00:56:42,285
You see anything familiar?

662
00:56:43,536 --> 00:56:45,705
You've already broken
all the laws of man.

663
00:56:45,913 --> 00:56:48,624
Now you've broken the laws
of nature too.

664
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:51,168
I can only assume you hid a device...

665
00:56:51,377 --> 00:56:53,671
...in a missile I hurled into the sun.

666
00:56:54,005 --> 00:56:57,800
Mr. Muscle, I'm gonna really miss
these little chats we have together.

667
00:56:58,009 --> 00:57:00,261
You're the only one who can
keep up with me.

668
00:57:00,636 --> 00:57:02,847
- Lenny!
- What?

669
00:57:03,806 --> 00:57:05,933
I wanna propose a toast.

670
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:10,771
To a nice guy, who's about
to finish last.

671
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:15,735
Destroy Superman!

672
00:57:16,235 --> 00:57:17,361
Later.

673
00:57:18,112 --> 00:57:21,115
He's a little bit anxious.
Can you blame him?

674
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:24,493
Not one of your great thinkers.

675
00:57:24,702 --> 00:57:27,830
But I, in all modesty, am.

676
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:32,376
The touching thing about this plan
is you helped me devise it.

677
00:57:32,585 --> 00:57:35,796
Prison has twisted
your mind into a delusional state.

678
00:57:36,005 --> 00:57:38,090
No, no, no. Listen.

679
00:57:38,299 --> 00:57:41,427
When I escaped from prison
I had one thing on my mind:

680
00:57:41,635 --> 00:57:43,429
The end of Superman.

681
00:57:43,888 --> 00:57:46,265
So there I was,
the first time in my life...

682
00:57:46,474 --> 00:57:51,187
...that I didn't have a long-range,
truly devious, criminal scheme.

683
00:57:51,354 --> 00:57:53,439
And then I came up with it.

684
00:57:54,065 --> 00:57:55,441
With this guy...

685
00:57:55,733 --> 00:57:57,276
...and you gone...

686
00:57:57,526 --> 00:57:59,987
...I'll make a fortune
rearming the world.

687
00:58:00,237 --> 00:58:03,824
You'd risk global nuclear war for
your own personal financial gain.

688
00:58:04,033 --> 00:58:08,245
Nobody wants war. I just want
to keep the threat alive.

689
00:58:11,207 --> 00:58:12,583
Nifty, huh?

690
00:58:17,421 --> 00:58:19,048
Good night, sweet prince.

691
00:58:21,217 --> 00:58:22,760
Parting is...

692
00:58:23,344 --> 00:58:24,553
...inevitable.

693
00:58:25,638 --> 00:58:27,723
Destroy Superman!

694
00:58:28,015 --> 00:58:30,434
First, I have fun.

695
00:59:34,373 --> 00:59:35,457
Help me!

696
00:59:45,217 --> 00:59:46,427
Thanks, Superman!

697
01:05:22,137 --> 01:05:25,515
I said I'd get you to run
one of our papers yourself...

698
01:05:25,724 --> 01:05:27,642
...and I meant it.

699
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:31,062
Congratulations, Miss Publisher.

700
01:05:31,271 --> 01:05:33,690
Thank you, Daddy, that's very nice.

701
01:05:33,899 --> 01:05:35,442
Step into your office.

702
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,947
- Where'd this come from?
- Somebody brought it in.

703
01:05:41,156 --> 01:05:42,657
We bought it, cheap.

704
01:05:42,824 --> 01:05:45,785
Okay...
This time you've gone too far.

705
01:05:47,203 --> 01:05:50,165
You can print your stupid rag
without Lois Lane.

706
01:05:53,835 --> 01:05:57,213
And you certainly have
no right to this!

707
01:05:57,756 --> 01:06:00,675
- Lois, I'm sorry!
- Let her go, darling.

708
01:06:00,884 --> 01:06:02,636
I mean, she's useless.

709
01:06:02,886 --> 01:06:05,555
And while you're at it,
fire that Clark Kent.

710
01:06:05,764 --> 01:06:08,308
He hasn't been around.
He hasn't even telephoned.

711
01:06:08,516 --> 01:06:10,769
I know, I'm worried about him.

712
01:06:10,977 --> 01:06:12,604
Oh, kitten...

713
01:06:12,812 --> 01:06:17,317
...didn't we have a talk about
personal involvement with the help?

714
01:06:17,567 --> 01:06:20,320
- Now that you're the publisher...
- Daddy.

715
01:06:20,528 --> 01:06:22,572
- Yes, darling.
- Stuff it!

716
01:06:25,325 --> 01:06:28,078
Lois! Lois, I'm sorry.

717
01:06:28,286 --> 01:06:30,997
I promise you I had
nothing to do with that.

718
01:06:37,671 --> 01:06:39,255
Have you heard from Clark?

719
01:06:43,134 --> 01:06:44,386
No.

720
01:07:08,952 --> 01:07:10,328
Just a minute.

721
01:07:10,954 --> 01:07:12,330
Oh, Lois.

722
01:07:13,081 --> 01:07:15,417
- What are you doing here?
- I knew it.

723
01:07:16,209 --> 01:07:20,004
I just have a really bad flu.
What do you mean you knew it?

724
01:07:20,213 --> 01:07:21,464
How did you know?

725
01:07:24,008 --> 01:07:26,928
You haven't been to work.
You haven't called the office.

726
01:07:27,137 --> 01:07:30,557
You haven't even called me back.
How could you not call me back?

727
01:07:34,352 --> 01:07:37,689
Whatever it is,
I guess you've got your reasons.

728
01:07:39,357 --> 01:07:41,484
But I knew you were here, you know?

729
01:07:42,819 --> 01:07:44,070
Somehow...

730
01:07:44,696 --> 01:07:46,906
...something pulled me here.

731
01:07:47,157 --> 01:07:49,242
I always know when Superman's
in trouble.

732
01:07:49,451 --> 01:07:52,537
Superman?
Something's happened to him?

733
01:07:53,371 --> 01:07:56,040
Everybody's saying that
he's dead but...

734
01:07:56,833 --> 01:08:00,837
...that can't be true, I just know it.
I feel it in my heart.

735
01:08:01,129 --> 01:08:02,672
I think he just needs help.

736
01:08:03,798 --> 01:08:06,634
Wherever he is, Lois,
I'm sure he'll manage.

737
01:08:07,051 --> 01:08:10,597
Well, if he can't manage...

738
01:08:11,055 --> 01:08:14,684
...and if he really is in trouble...

739
01:08:14,893 --> 01:08:19,147
...then there's a few things
I'd like to tell him.

740
01:08:21,232 --> 01:08:22,692
I'd tell him...

741
01:08:23,776 --> 01:08:27,614
...that I will always cherish
the time we spent together.

742
01:08:28,198 --> 01:08:31,701
And that I never expected
anything in return.

743
01:08:32,535 --> 01:08:34,370
And no matter...

744
01:08:35,205 --> 01:08:38,583
...how few minutes I saw him for,
it always made me happy.

745
01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:42,420
And I would tell him
that I love him...

746
01:08:43,338 --> 01:08:45,298
...and that I'll always love him.

747
01:08:46,132 --> 01:08:47,217
And that...

748
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:48,635
...whatever...

749
01:08:50,053 --> 01:08:52,513
...happens to the world...

750
01:08:53,264 --> 01:08:54,641
...I know that...

751
01:08:55,642 --> 01:08:59,771
...he's doing his best to make sure
it's all right for the rest of us.

752
01:09:00,146 --> 01:09:01,981
Well, wherever he is, Lois...

753
01:09:02,523 --> 01:09:06,402
...I know that he would
want to thank you.

754
01:09:13,618 --> 01:09:16,329
Listen, I'm pretty tired, you know?

755
01:09:16,537 --> 01:09:20,416
So I think I'll just rest here
for a while. Okay?

756
01:09:20,792 --> 01:09:22,210
I'll be fine.

757
01:09:22,794 --> 01:09:25,505
It's okay. Please?

758
01:09:29,008 --> 01:09:31,886
- I hope you feel better, Clark.
- Thanks.

759
01:09:41,312 --> 01:09:46,192
If you do see him, or hear from him...

760
01:09:48,778 --> 01:09:50,488
...he might need this.

761
01:09:58,079 --> 01:09:59,622
Oh, Lex.

762
01:09:59,831 --> 01:10:03,960
We're all very pleased at all
the nuclear missiles and arms...

763
01:10:04,168 --> 01:10:06,087
...you've helped us sell...

764
01:10:06,254 --> 01:10:10,174
...and we've decided
to increase your commission.

765
01:10:10,383 --> 01:10:13,386
Oh, guys, really, that's great.

766
01:10:14,178 --> 01:10:16,431
It is the least we could do.

767
01:10:16,973 --> 01:10:19,267
Well, I had another idea.
Gentlemen...

768
01:10:19,475 --> 01:10:23,271
...I've decided to assume
control of the company.

769
01:10:30,778 --> 01:10:33,114
My first official act,
of course, is to say:

770
01:10:33,322 --> 01:10:34,657
"You're fired!"

771
01:10:36,242 --> 01:10:37,452
You're mad!

772
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:39,245
Oh, really?

773
01:10:49,172 --> 01:10:51,674
If you want a reference for work...

774
01:10:51,883 --> 01:10:53,426
...forget it!

775
01:10:56,846 --> 01:10:58,389
That's a good bit.

776
01:10:59,765 --> 01:11:03,769
You know with my brains, and your...
Frankly, your...

777
01:11:04,061 --> 01:11:07,607
...brawn, the possibilities
are absolutely staggering.

778
01:11:07,815 --> 01:11:10,860
You know, I could be president,
emperor, king.

779
01:11:11,319 --> 01:11:13,196
See how scared those guys were?

780
01:11:13,362 --> 01:11:15,198
And what do you fear?

781
01:11:16,073 --> 01:11:21,037
What? Now? With Superman dead,
and you're on my team?

782
01:11:21,496 --> 01:11:25,791
It's like you're the best power
forward ever. What's to fear?

783
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:43,976
<i>All that remains of
Krypton's energy is yours.</i>

784
01:11:44,769 --> 01:11:46,395
<i>After it is gone...</i>

785
01:11:46,604 --> 01:11:50,066
<i>... you will belong solely
to your new home.</i>

786
01:11:51,442 --> 01:11:55,780
<i>If our dying planet can
save your life, my son...</i>

787
01:11:56,822 --> 01:11:59,283
<i>... we have not died in vain.</i>

788
01:13:05,641 --> 01:13:08,477
- Where is the woman?
- You'll never find her.

789
01:13:08,811 --> 01:13:12,565
If you will not tell me,
I will hurt people.

790
01:13:33,794 --> 01:13:36,088
Stop! Don't do it, the people!

791
01:14:34,188 --> 01:14:35,981
All right, stop! That's enough!

792
01:14:36,398 --> 01:14:37,816
That's enough!

793
01:14:38,025 --> 01:14:40,069
You win. I'll take you to her.

794
01:15:11,976 --> 01:15:14,353
- Where is she?
- Far away from here and safe.

795
01:15:15,271 --> 01:15:17,106
Don't go in, she's not in there!

796
01:19:17,846 --> 01:19:20,098
We've gotta tone down
these headlines.

797
01:19:20,307 --> 01:19:24,102
Tone down our headlines?
That's all the common man reads!

798
01:19:24,311 --> 01:19:29,232
- We can do with less sensationalism.
- Less sensational papers go broke.

799
01:19:29,524 --> 01:19:33,862
I thought I taught you long ago that
the business of newspapers is business.

800
01:19:34,071 --> 01:19:35,197
No, Daddy...

801
01:19:35,405 --> 01:19:37,491
...our business is journalism.

802
01:19:37,991 --> 01:19:40,202
We can't keep being
so irresponsible...

803
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:42,579
...or we'll lead everyone
into disaster.

804
01:19:42,788 --> 01:19:44,790
Don't be overdramatic,
young lady.

805
01:19:44,998 --> 01:19:48,168
What kind of disaster could
we possibly help bring about?

806
01:19:50,587 --> 01:19:51,588
Lacy!

807
01:21:24,806 --> 01:21:26,182
What's going on? Hey!

808
01:21:42,490 --> 01:21:45,493
Are you sure you know what
you're doing, Mr. White?

809
01:21:45,702 --> 01:21:46,911
Well...

810
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:50,415
Here comes Mr. Warfield.

811
01:21:51,041 --> 01:21:53,043
You better have a good explanation...

812
01:21:53,251 --> 01:21:56,212
...or else you'll be talking
to your lawyers from jail.

813
01:21:56,421 --> 01:21:58,923
You know, I'm not a tycoon.

814
01:21:59,132 --> 01:22:00,884
I'm just an old reporter.

815
01:22:01,092 --> 01:22:03,553
But I've read enough
in my own newspaper...

816
01:22:03,762 --> 01:22:06,848
...about hostile takeovers
at big companies.

817
01:22:07,057 --> 01:22:09,809
You, Mr. Warfield, must have
been asleep at the wheel.

818
01:22:10,018 --> 01:22:12,687
Because I've convinced
the bankers of this city...

819
01:22:12,896 --> 01:22:17,150
<i>...that our Daily Planet should be
treated like a natural resource...</i>

820
01:22:17,359 --> 01:22:19,361
...protected from predators.

821
01:22:19,652 --> 01:22:23,740
I convinced them to lend me the money.
I bought the outstanding shares.

822
01:22:23,948 --> 01:22:28,661
And you, Mr. Warfield,
are now a minority shareholder.

823
01:22:29,871 --> 01:22:31,206
Everyone, back to work.

824
01:22:31,790 --> 01:22:33,166
Way to tell him, chief!

825
01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:38,379
Well, I'm sorry.
You win some and you lose some.

826
01:22:38,588 --> 01:22:41,382
Now this is what I call a newspaper.

827
01:22:41,591 --> 01:22:43,802
<i>Compliments of The Daily Planet.</i>

828
01:22:44,219 --> 01:22:46,888
- Have a nice day. We did it!
- We're back!

829
01:22:51,643 --> 01:22:53,728
- Hi, am I late?
- Hi, how you doing?

830
01:22:53,937 --> 01:22:57,649
It must've been some effort for
you to drag yourself out of bed.

831
01:22:57,857 --> 01:23:01,361
I'm feeling a lot better.
I had a visit from a good nurse.

832
01:23:01,569 --> 01:23:04,906
It must've been good medicine because
she said you were really ill.

833
01:23:05,073 --> 01:23:08,868
Sometimes all you need is loving
attention from the right person.

834
01:23:09,077 --> 01:23:10,745
Glad you're back, Clark.

835
01:23:10,954 --> 01:23:14,040
And remember I am covering
Superman's press conference.

836
01:23:14,249 --> 01:23:17,919
- Just tape reactions from the crowd.
- Reactions, okay.

837
01:23:18,503 --> 01:23:19,504
Oh, dear.

838
01:23:19,712 --> 01:23:21,506
Guess I need a tape recorder, huh?

839
01:23:21,714 --> 01:23:22,715
- Be right back.
- Clark.

840
01:23:22,924 --> 01:23:25,802
Same old Mr. Kent.
He'll never change.

841
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:27,679
I hope not.

842
01:23:36,437 --> 01:23:39,607
- How you doing, Superman?
- Lois, good to see you again.

843
01:23:39,816 --> 01:23:41,484
Good to see you too.

844
01:23:41,693 --> 01:23:42,986
Morning, gentlemen.

845
01:23:43,444 --> 01:23:44,612
Excuse me.

846
01:23:45,154 --> 01:23:45,989
Thank you.

847
01:23:46,656 --> 01:23:50,368
Once more, we survived the threat
of war and found a fragile peace.

848
01:23:51,286 --> 01:23:54,205
I thought I could give you
freedom from war but...

849
01:23:54,414 --> 01:23:57,292
...I was wrong.
It's not mine to give.

850
01:23:58,835 --> 01:24:00,628
We're still a young planet.

851
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:04,007
There are galaxies out there...

852
01:24:04,299 --> 01:24:07,802
...other civilizations for us
to meet, to learn from.

853
01:24:08,428 --> 01:24:10,638
What a brilliant future we could have.

854
01:24:10,889 --> 01:24:13,975
And there will be peace when
the people of the world...

855
01:24:14,183 --> 01:24:15,685
...want it so badly...

856
01:24:15,893 --> 01:24:19,063
...their governments will
have to give it to them.

857
01:24:21,482 --> 01:24:24,360
I wish you could see the Earth
the way that I see it...

858
01:24:24,569 --> 01:24:28,197
...because when you really look
at it, it's just one world.

859
01:24:32,410 --> 01:24:34,037
Do you think he'll find us?

860
01:24:34,245 --> 01:24:37,624
Never. We'll lay low for a while...

861
01:24:37,832 --> 01:24:41,044
...a couple of years.
I'll come up with a new plan.

862
01:24:41,794 --> 01:24:44,255
Good thing I bought my drums.

863
01:24:57,935 --> 01:25:00,563
Uncle Lex,
you're not gonna believe this...

864
01:25:00,772 --> 01:25:02,732
...but it's Superman!
- Superman!

865
01:25:07,779 --> 01:25:11,407
- Hey, this rocks!
- Morning, Father.

866
01:25:11,616 --> 01:25:14,327
This kid's been under a bad
influence. Can you help?

867
01:25:14,535 --> 01:25:17,205
- Every boy can be helped.
- I think you're right.

868
01:25:17,413 --> 01:25:19,415
- Good luck, son.
- Come with me, friend.

869
01:25:19,624 --> 01:25:21,751
You wouldn't happen
to have a drum set?

870
01:25:21,959 --> 01:25:24,796
Hey, Mozart's back!

871
01:25:29,717 --> 01:25:32,637
- Duane, Mozart's back!
- I see him, Bubba!

872
01:25:34,931 --> 01:25:36,307
Shut up!

873
01:25:37,308 --> 01:25:40,478
- All right, take him away.
- Thank you. Come on, Luthor.

874
01:25:41,354 --> 01:25:44,816
- Just one thing, how did you beat him?
- High school physics.

875
01:25:45,108 --> 01:25:47,110
I had time to figure out...

876
01:25:47,318 --> 01:25:50,988
...that if it was born from the sun,
that had to be its energy.

877
01:25:51,197 --> 01:25:54,200
- Is the world gonna be vaporized?
- No, Luthor.

878
01:25:54,367 --> 01:25:57,620
It's as it always was, on the brink,
with good fighting evil.

879
01:25:57,829 --> 01:25:59,080
See you in 20.

880
01:26:00,305 --> 01:27:00,452

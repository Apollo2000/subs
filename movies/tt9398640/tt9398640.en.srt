1
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:17,825
<i>Yep, check, check. Yep.</i>

2
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,143
<i>- Thank you.
- Sorry about the leaky pipes.</i>

3
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:22,827
<i>It shouldn't affect the interview at all.</i>

4
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:24,476
<i>You good with sound
and everything on that?</i>

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,820
<i>We'll take it out in post.</i>

6
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:30,338
<i>Uh, that's just plumbing,
'cause it's not even raining outside.</i>

7
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,708
<i>Sorry.</i>

8
00:00:32,917 --> 00:00:35,497
<i>Hi, welcome to another edition</i>
<i>of </i>Between Two Ferns.

9
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,043
<i>I'm your host, Zach Galifianakis,</i>

10
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,825
<i>and today my guest is...</i>

11
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:40,633
Matthew...

12
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:41,922
McConnach...

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
McCannoway.

14
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,208
Matthew McConnarr...

15
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,168
Matthew McConnagee. McConaughey.

16
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:50,745
Good to be here, Zach.

17
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,713
All right, all right, all right.

18
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:58,375
Sorry, I was just reading the box office
returns for your last three movies.

19
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:01,332
All right.

20
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:02,958
All right.

21
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,490
I guess that one was all right.

22
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,883
I notice that you're wearing a shirt.

23
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:09,417
Is everything okay?

24
00:01:10,917 --> 00:01:11,917
You fucking kidding me?

25
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:14,332
Of all the things
you can win an Oscar for,

26
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:16,877
how surprised are you
that you won one for acting?

27
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:18,495
Here we go.

28
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,633
But so did that guy
from <i>Thirty Seconds To Mars.</i>

29
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:22,292
So, um...

30
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,575
how proud can you really be?

31
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:24,537
How much time do we have?

32
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:27,059
I'm out of here in about 15 minutes,
so whatever. Do something.

33
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:27,963
What do you have to do?

34
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:30,672
Go drive around in a Lincoln convertible,
shirtless?

35
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,750
Yeah.

36
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,583
Your dad died while having sex
with your mom,

37
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:37,917
and you've said that you want
to go out the same way.

38
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:40,422
You and your mom need
to set up some boundaries.

39
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:41,518
- No, it's not true.
- I wasn't...

40
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:43,018
- Next question.
- It wasn't supposed to be funny.

41
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:45,122
- It's just a rumor that I heard.
- Yeah, I hear you.

42
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:48,037
Who do you think will accidentally
starve himself to death first,

43
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:49,285
you or Christian Bale?

44
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,455
You lost so much weight for that movie,

45
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:55,457
I thought you might die from fake AIDS.

46
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:57,252
I've got three kids, I got a wife.

47
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,333
What have you got?

48
00:01:58,958 --> 00:01:59,958
Besides two ferns?

49
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,380
At least you're watering them, I see.

50
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:07,882
Yeah, and again, I'm sorry.

51
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:09,838
- We'll fix it in the edit.
- Doesn't bother me.

52
00:02:11,917 --> 00:02:13,247
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

53
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:14,538
Can I just, uh...

54
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:17,792
...see what's going on with these pipes?

55
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,083
I got a lighter.

56
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,575
Dude, don't do that.

57
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,208
Help!

58
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:36,752
A little help here?

59
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,207
I can't get out!

60
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:49,075
Who was the idiot
that installed the sprinkler system?

61
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,668
- What's the way out, Zach?
- I don't know, Matthew!

62
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,101
Well, where did we come in from?

63
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:57,125
I don't recall, Matthew,
I'm a little... stressed!

64
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,583
Well, they turned the sprinklers off.

65
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:41,422
And... action.

66
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,583
Hello,

67
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,753
and welcome to <i>Behind Two Ferns,</i>

68
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,963
the story of <i>Between Two Ferns,</i>

69
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:49,082
a special feature-length documentary

70
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:52,247
providing an inside glimpse
at my award-losing talk show.

71
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,040
I'm Zach Galifianakis.

72
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:55,995
We're here in Flinch, North Carolina,

73
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,458
where I've taped my show
for over ten years.

74
00:03:59,042 --> 00:04:00,462
Not only do I host the show,

75
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,168
but I will be your tour guide

76
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:04,207
throughout your cinematic experience.

77
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:07,627
Who knows,
maybe the movie will even be in 3D?

78
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,038
Little trivia about my show,

79
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,630
I originally wanted to call it
<i>Betwixt Two Ferns,</i>

80
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,788
but I thought that was
too highbrow for the public.

81
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:21,132
Our journey begins here,
like most classic tales,

82
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:24,038
with our hero opening a door
into adventure.

83
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,710
And... cut.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,170
Great, that was the best one.

85
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,393
Twenty-one takes is good for you?

86
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:33,518
Twenty-one takes?
That's really, really good for me, yep.

87
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:34,462
We can move on?

88
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:36,782
- Yeah, let's move on, that was perfect.
- Okay, move on!

89
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,825
<i>I grew up here in the small town
of Flinch, North Carolina,</i>

90
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:43,707
<i>and ever since I was a kid, I...</i>

91
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:47,462
<i>dreamed of being a big
network TV personality.</i>

92
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,375
<i>But things haven't worked out
exactly as planned.</i>

93
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,184
<i>From Flinch, North Carolina,</i>

94
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,828
<i>it's Flinch Public Access Television!</i>

95
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,000
Anybody watching this show
has the ability to make a piñata.

96
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,184
- You're lying. You didn't say that.
- The lifeblood of America.

97
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,101
- You told me it was about waste water.
- I don't lie.

98
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,785
I have no idea what I'd do without you.

99
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,785
Think about soccer,
you don't even use your hands.

100
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:18,212
That's what makes us human.

101
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:19,915
Didn't like that card.

102
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:21,867
Didn't like that card, either.

103
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:23,417
Where do you keep your Oscar?

104
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:24,792
I mean your, uh...

105
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,503
Blockbuster Entertainment Award?

106
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:33,247
We are here, at, uh...

107
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,460
Flinch Public Access Television,

108
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:37,422
FPAT-V, for short.

109
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,080
<i>What's great about public access</i>

110
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:41,417
<i>is the feel of community.</i>

111
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,210
Here comes the tornado.

112
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,535
<i>Anybody's voice can be heard here.</i>

113
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,125
Top that, motherfucker.

114
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,420
<i>This is where I've been
taping my shows for over a decade now.</i>

115
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:54,747
- Hi.
- Hi!

116
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:55,958
I'm, uh...

117
00:05:56,292 --> 00:06:00,292
Keanu Reeves and I'm here
for <i>Between Two Ferns.</i>

118
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,705
Oh, yeah.

119
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:06,737
Hi, my name is Zach Galifianakis.

120
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:07,952
Welcome to another edition...

121
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,750
of <i>Between Two Ferns.</i>

122
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,083
Uh, my guest today is Keanu Reeves.

123
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,288
- Thank you for being here.
<i>- </i>Thanks for having me here.

124
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,325
You have a big scar, I hear,
from a motorcycle accident?

125
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:19,707
Yeah, I do, yeah.

126
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,083
Is it... Where is it?

127
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,684
- Just goes from here to here.
- Big one?

128
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,101
- God, that big?
- Yeah, it's about...

129
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,075
I have a similar scar on my...
on my leg.

130
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,333
From what?

131
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:30,172
Walked out of the movie <i>Lake House.</i>

132
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:32,832
Bumped into the seat in front of me.

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,380
On a scale of one to 100,

134
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,748
how many words do you know?

135
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,880
One to 100?

136
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,580
Like, do you know 50 words?

137
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:42,997
Do you know 75 words?

138
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,673
Do you know 18 words?

139
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,375
Is it frustrating, uh...

140
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,788
to have people think of you
as a complete bozo?

141
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,542
When the truth is that you're just...

142
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,788
a man with below average intelligence?

143
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:55,958
Just do...

144
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,418
one for yes, and then...

145
00:06:58,792 --> 00:06:59,792
two for no.

146
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,753
Do you research your roles?

147
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:03,167
Yeah.

148
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,665
Have you ever considered researching
a character that has taken acting classes?

149
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,455
Right now I'm acting like this is fun.

150
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,830
How am I doing?

151
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,287
<i>It's a good show.</i>

152
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,125
Right now,
it's the seventh-ranked show in, uh...

153
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,960
southeastern North Carolina's
public access television market.

154
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:23,497
I mean, do I have other dreams?

155
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,785
I've always wanted to jet ski to Alaska.

156
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,380
<i>But, ultimately, in life,
I'd like to have my own</i>

157
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,165
<i>late night talk show.</i>

158
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,125
But this, for now,

159
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
what I have now...

160
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,333
this will do.

161
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,083
<i>Who's on cocaine?</i>

162
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:45,542
I'm sorry, I thought someone said
someone's on cocaine,

163
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,785
and I was like, "Who's on cocaine?"

164
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,333
'Cause it's not me.

165
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,633
You ready? Let's do it.

166
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:55,422
<i>Okay. So, how did you stumble across Zach?</i>

167
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:58,172
When I, uh, first saw some...

168
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,288
footage of...

169
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,333
...this fat idiot, Zach Galifianakis,

170
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:08,167
I thought...
I thought it was a practical joke.

171
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,420
I don't know if you wanna get
a tight shot of that?

172
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:13,747
<i>America's Dumbest Television Hosts.</i>

173
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:18,245
And, uh, I saw him on this tape
and he was so...

174
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,423
He was such an idiot,

175
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,128
and he was so dumb,

176
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,955
and so fat.

177
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,253
So, uh, without asking,

178
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,878
I uploaded it to my website, Funny Or Die,

179
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:30,667
and, uh...

180
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:31,917
All the clicks.

181
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,375
Over 500 trillion and counting.

182
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,038
And those clicks...

183
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,790
equals more green,

184
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,670
which equals more white,

185
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,080
which equals more...

186
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:45,792
purple.

187
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,415
That's me putting on a big,

188
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:50,582
purple feather boa.

189
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:54,007
Yeah, so, I signed him
to an exclusive contract

190
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,293
and, you know,

191
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,625
started forcing my Hollywood friends
to be interviewed by him.

192
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,825
Hi, welcome to another edition
of <i>Between Two Ferns.</i>

193
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,577
Uh, my guest today is...

194
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,250
Chance the Rapper.

195
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:06,997
Hi.

196
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,963
You're an actor, a rapper, an activist.

197
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:10,632
Why aren't you also an astronaut?

198
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:14,415
Uh...
I don't know. I'm not very, uh...

199
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,168
- like, I don't come from, uh...
- Space.

200
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,038
Yep.

201
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,495
If your parents had not named you
Chance the Rapper,

202
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,743
do you think you would have
pursued a different career?

203
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,168
My parents didn't name me
Chance the Rapper.

204
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,330
That's a stage name.

205
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:29,417
Any siblings?

206
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:31,172
I have one brother, yeah.

207
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,330
What's he do for a living?

208
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:33,417
He's a rapper too.

209
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:34,672
What is his name?

210
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,210
Community Chest the Rapper?

211
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:38,787
Uh, no.

212
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,165
You're friends with Kanye West.

213
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,292
That's the joke.

214
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,040
I don't like that joke.

215
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,643
Will you just give these a chance?

216
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:50,667
They're fine.

217
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:52,382
This is good stuff.

218
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,832
Stop fucking playing with me right now.

219
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,809
<i>So, it seems like you have
a lot of responsibility here.</i>

220
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,423
I do. The show carries
a lot of responsibility,

221
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,143
- but, you know...
- Oh, my God.

222
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:03,877
I'm surrounded by a really good team.

223
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,498
My office is right this way.

224
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,633
Got a great view of everybody,
I can kinda keep an eye on things.

225
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:15,957
I feel sorry for people who use laptops.

226
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,463
They don't get that exercise.

227
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,133
<i>I'm Carol.</i>

228
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,668
I am Zach's right-hand woman, yeah.

229
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,535
He cares about his job.

230
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,628
He's very creative.

231
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,538
He's very clever.

232
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,915
<i>So, I do a lot of things for him,
he's very busy, and...</i>

233
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,288
<i>um, he just needs somebody
to take care of all the details,</i>

234
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,875
and I'm happy to do it.

235
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,248
Sometimes words are overwhelming for him.

236
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,226
He needs to just
kind of break it up a little bit.

237
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,460
Zach likes me to cut out all the big
top stories of the day from the newspaper.

238
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,018
Just throw them in the trash
so he can just look at the pictures.

239
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:46,351
I've written down lists of things

240
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,309
that I wanted him to make sure
he remembered, and...

241
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,963
his brain just doesn't work that way.

242
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:50,882
<i>He needs it to be drawn.</i>

243
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,708
<i>So, it'll just be a picture of him,</i>

244
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,083
<i>in bed,</i>

245
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,165
<i>and every step,
from removing the covers,</i>

246
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,670
<i>standing up, walking...</i>

247
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,880
And then after that,

248
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,328
that's you in the car.

249
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:01,827
When I leave?

250
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:02,917
Yeah.

251
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,633
- Hey.
- Hi.

252
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,880
<i>Zach also has me run
personal errands for him.</i>

253
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,133
<i>For instance, he has very sensitive skin,</i>

254
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:12,078
<i>and he needs to wear panty liners
to protect his private area.</i>

255
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,788
I call her the Getter.

256
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,330
She gets it.

257
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:17,957
She gets me and she gets...

258
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:19,538
guest,

259
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,625
and she gets...
she gets things for me.

260
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:23,878
So I call her the Getter.

261
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,583
And, uh...

262
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,080
she's wonderful.

263
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:29,417
So, Zach has a thing called
"fernspection,"

264
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,920
where he wants to make sure
that the ferns are just so,

265
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,540
and they have to be
exactly the same in every episode.

266
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,165
<i>He likes that continuity.</i>

267
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,378
Green as ever. They look great.

268
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,170
Moisture's nice. Good.

269
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:48,958
Ow.

270
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,958
- Why do they look so different?
- I don't...

271
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:57,382
I don't know how to take care of these.
Keep killing them.

272
00:11:58,292 --> 00:12:00,012
I just buy new ones
whenever we have a show.

273
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,333
Is the width off to you? No, that's right.

274
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:06,382
Looks good.

275
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,458
That's exactly what it was last time.

276
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:13,132
What's the readout?

277
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,351
- I have one.
- Whoa. No, no, no.

278
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,375
It says one.

279
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,880
I gotta say...

280
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:19,877
it's hard to believe I've used
the same ferns all these years.

281
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,333
- Okay. So, yeah, we all set?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

282
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,870
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

283
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,203
Good work. Really good work.

284
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,723
Hey, Chuck, I wanted to talk you about...

285
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,320
<i>So, I've heard people
call you by your nickname.</i>

286
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:34,627
<i>Can you explain what it means?</i>

287
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:37,712
I'm nicknamed Cam
because it's short for Cameron.

288
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:40,167
A lot of people say, like,
"No, you're nicknamed Cam

289
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,080
because now you work with cameras,"
but that's not true.

290
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:44,957
I'm probably one of the top,

291
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:47,247
you know, 50...

292
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,503
<i>...probably top 50 cameramen
you can find.</i>

293
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,290
<i>I'm not crazy about him.</i>

294
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,245
His attitude is... sloppy.

295
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,540
I asked for an ecu of the button.

296
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:00,167
You know? And I...

297
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:01,582
I didn't see your camera move.

298
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:02,707
An ECU?

299
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,128
<i>Zach is...</i>

300
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:07,327
and I'll say this
the nicest way I know how,

301
00:13:07,542 --> 00:13:09,292
he is an absolute piece of shit,

302
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:11,252
garbage rat, loser,

303
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,625
uh, donkey.

304
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,748
He's the biggest piece of shit
I've met in my life

305
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,793
and I've met some big pieces of shit.

306
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,578
In life <i>and </i>in a toilet.

307
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,133
I have a really good time,
and I like Zach.

308
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,000
I think he's...
I think he's sweet.

309
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,976
You didn't come to Cecil's birthday party.
You know, Cecil, the janitor?

310
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,880
She's good.

311
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,168
I like her enthusiasm.

312
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:30,476
A little annoying.

313
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,380
We didn't have cupcakes,
'cause he's vegan now.

314
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,658
Did you know that, he's vegan?

315
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,915
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, so I got like plums and persimmons.

316
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,130
It's fine, I mean...

317
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,420
That woman
fucking annoys the shit out of me.

318
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:44,809
So there's a lot of celebrities
passing through the studio, right?

319
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,463
Oh, yeah, tons and tons.
Like, everybody.

320
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:48,882
I feel like there's nobody
who hasn't been through here.

321
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,768
Thank you so much
for doing this pre-interview.

322
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:52,768
- Yeah.
- So, I heard you have a funny story.

323
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:53,792
We'd love to hear it.

324
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,633
Oh, yeah, so, basically,
I got home late from work

325
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,498
and I was really tired and I parked...

326
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,183
Maybe ask her what race she is.

327
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,915
I'm not sure how that's relevant here.

328
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,670
Okay, is there something, like,
light you wanna talk about,

329
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,960
that's, like, something funny?

330
00:14:07,042 --> 00:14:08,362
I think you kind of...
It's not...

331
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:09,707
It doesn't have to be like that.

332
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,665
Yeah, like a flippant story
about being half black, half white

333
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,750
or something like that.

334
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,790
Hi, I'm Zach.

335
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,495
- Hey, Adam, from <i>Parks and Recreation.</i>
- Oh, God.

336
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:20,127
That is refreshing to hear.

337
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:24,075
I'm so used to interviewing dumb actors
with their dumb actor lifestyles and stuff

338
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:25,887
so it's nice to interview
real people and...

339
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:28,577
Sorry, the TV show <i>Parks and Recreation.</i>

340
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,540
Okay. Let's get you miked up.

341
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,125
Great.

342
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:35,882
What temperature was it in there?

343
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,198
- It's hard for me to concentrate...
- You like swimming?

344
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,208
Yeah?

345
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:42,382
I got a lot of bathing suits in my car.

346
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,828
Turning down a celebrity

347
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:48,997
is maybe the greatest joy
a person can have.

348
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,083
Can I get a plum?

349
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,955
Yes, of course. How are you?

350
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:53,422
Not gonna happen, champ.

351
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:58,877
<i>Zach, he's always around,</i>

352
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,328
he pretends that he needs
to be here all the time.

353
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:03,332
He keeps taking stuff from the shelf.

354
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:04,957
I know he does.

355
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,670
My name is Shirl Clarts,

356
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,880
S-H-I-R-L C-L-A-R-T-S.

357
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:12,976
- <i>And what do you do here?</i>
- I'm the station manager.

358
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,290
I run this whole deal.

359
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,125
You know what a lion is?

360
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,458
A lion is a strong animal.

361
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,168
They do what the fuck they wanna do.

362
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,833
Take what they want, eat what they want,
they run when they feel like it.

363
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:26,127
Lion.

364
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:28,247
And then Bobby...

365
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,083
is the assistant manager,

366
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:32,957
and he's worked here
for a long time, too.

367
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:34,042
Put me on speaker.

368
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:35,788
Put me on speaker.

369
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:37,875
Put me on speaker now.

370
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,878
- Should I come back?
- Diane!

371
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:43,422
Hey, Diane!

372
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:45,042
Am I on speaker?

373
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:47,247
- I'll come back.
- No, come in.

374
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:48,667
Am I on speaker?

375
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
All right, good.

376
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:51,497
Love you, bye.

377
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,423
Come in.

378
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,583
What's up?

379
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,830
Did you take my Hamburger Helper boxes
out of the break room?

380
00:15:56,917 --> 00:15:59,417
- What if I did?
- I want my Hamburger Helper boxes back!

381
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,934
<i>All right.
I'll just write a check for you.</i>

382
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,748
They're, like, $1.15 each.

383
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:03,883
Well, there was two boxes.

384
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,498
All right, so, 3.50?

385
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,630
<i>Hey!</i>

386
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,458
Where are you going?

387
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,620
<i>We're going home.</i>

388
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:15,577
No, you have to film at all times.

389
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:18,127
If I say, "Cut,"
that means keep the camera rolling.

390
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,038
If I say,
"Get that camera out of my face,"

391
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,205
put that camera in my face.

392
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,750
Okay?

393
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,226
Let's do it again, from the top.

394
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,143
You wanna do this conversation again
from the top?

395
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:30,037
Yeah, this is my life story.
You ruined that scene of my life story.

396
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:33,082
So did you, by the way.
Let's take it from the top.

397
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:37,707
Where are you going?

398
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:39,172
I'm going home.

399
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,918
- That's bad acting. Bad acting.
- I don't buy it.

400
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,250
Welcome to another edition
of <i>Between Two Ferns.</i>

401
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,793
I'm your host, Zach Galifianakis,

402
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,125
and my guest today is...

403
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:50,792
Brie Larson.

404
00:16:51,292 --> 00:16:52,292
Thank you, Brie.

405
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,498
You won Best Actress.

406
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,753
Have you ever thought of aiming higher
and trying to win Best Actor?

407
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,583
Um...

408
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,495
- I... Yeah...
- Good question.

409
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,463
It is good. It's thought-provoking.

410
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:07,042
Your superhero character
is called Captain Marvel.

411
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,125
Yes.

412
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
Boy, they really have stopped trying,
haven't they?

413
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,380
I mean, why don't they call it
Captain Comic Book,

414
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:15,922
or Captain We Can't Think
Of Anything Else?

415
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,750
And what would your superhero name be?

416
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:18,883
Cap'n Crunch?

417
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,168
I read online that you're very private
and decline to answer

418
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,040
questions that make you
feel uncomfortable.

419
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,875
This is a two-parter.

420
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:27,828
Is that true?

421
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:30,207
And how old were you
when you got your first period?

422
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:35,287
His show's success
is absolutely predicated on the fact

423
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,325
that people are laughing <i>at </i>him,

424
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,583
not with him.

425
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,083
<i>I think it's utterly fascinating</i>

426
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,958
<i>that someone that grotesque</i>

427
00:17:45,042 --> 00:17:47,422
<i>can actually be watchable.</i>

428
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:50,458
Hmm.

429
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,673
What is all this?

430
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:08,042
Carol!

431
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,170
- What's going on out here?
- Huh?

432
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:13,577
What is going on?

433
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,168
Something's going on with the pipes.

434
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,101
Yeah, no kidding.

435
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,075
What we have here is the perfect storm.

436
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:21,327
Old pipes, water line blockage.

437
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,130
And, for some weird reason,

438
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,788
someone shoved

439
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:28,075
a whole bunch
of shit-stained panty liners

440
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:29,542
down your commodes.

441
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:30,495
Come on, man!

442
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,963
This blockage is so major,
it could blow at any time.

443
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:34,882
Whoever did this is gonna pay for it.

444
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,518
Oh, disgusting!

445
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:37,382
Oh, God!

446
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,078
Zach, it's too noisy with the plumbing
and the construction.

447
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:41,559
We're not gonna be able
to interview the guest...

448
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,923
This whole place
needs to be soundproof, okay?

449
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:47,333
Every nook and cranny, Laura and Danny.

450
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,167
I want everything peepless, okay?

451
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,250
Just do it!

452
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,168
I mean, I would, I just...

453
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,325
I watch <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
with my roommate on...

454
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:11,417
- You what?
- I'm watching TV tonight, so...

455
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,580
I would, but I can't tonight, sorry.

456
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:14,998
But, thank you.

457
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:19,462
- Hey, Matthew. Zach.
- McConaughey, nice to meet you.

458
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,542
- Nice to see you.
- Thanks so much for joining us.

459
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:36,184
The interview should be nice and easy.

460
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,458
Thanks so much for...
This'll be nice and short.

461
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,333
Are you ready to start?

462
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,995
You have a major leak in here.

463
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,735
- Everything all right there? Okay.
- No, everything's fine.

464
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:00,917
Oh, my God.

465
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,920
Grab your smartphones!

466
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,880
Oh, God!

467
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,518
Look out!
Gotta get out of here.

468
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:14,875
Oh, God!

469
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,208
Oh, my God.

470
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:17,792
Oh, no.

471
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,673
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

472
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,165
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

473
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:44,708
My ferns!

474
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,670
What happened?

475
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,960
My glasses!

476
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:50,287
Thank God I found you!

477
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:06,042
Ah!

478
00:21:14,292 --> 00:21:16,172
I got a call from Will Ferrell
this morning.

479
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,380
He's very upset.

480
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,290
And he said to stand outside
of this station

481
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,285
and be outside at 3:00 p.m.

482
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,375
Is it 3:00?

483
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:56,747
You.

484
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:57,833
Me.

485
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,458
Inside.

486
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,458
Hey, look at this, okay?

487
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:07,327
These are my clicks.

488
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:09,787
My website runs on clicks.

489
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,075
Can you see that?

490
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:12,377
It's a lot of clicks, Will.

491
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,078
Or is the fat
drooping off your eyebrows

492
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,710
impairing your vision?

493
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,415
Besides, you killed Matthew McConaughey.

494
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:22,292
He's dead?

495
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:25,962
Well, they administered CPR to him,
and he...

496
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:27,963
he's brought back to life.

497
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:31,172
But... but yeah, he was,
he was momentarily dead.

498
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:32,827
You are a murderer.

499
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:34,497
It was a temporary murder, if it was...

500
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:35,833
It was not a murder!

501
00:22:35,917 --> 00:22:37,627
Fine. I'll keep your secret.

502
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,285
Okay? But you owe me.

503
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:41,083
Owe you what?

504
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:44,002
Ten episodes
of <i>Between Two Ferns, </i>all right?

505
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,893
And I need them three weeks from today.

506
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:49,378
No. Hold on,
let's make this interesting.

507
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,168
How about two weeks from today?

508
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:53,955
9:00 a.m.

509
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:55,962
How? I can't film here anymore.

510
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:58,292
You're just going to have to go
to the celebrities,

511
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:00,127
wherever you can find them

512
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,503
across the country.

513
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,583
But what do I get in return, Mr. Ferrell?

514
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:05,327
You'll be showered in...

515
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:08,788
gold, and spices, and rare gems,

516
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:10,668
rubies and emeralds.

517
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,290
But I don't want that stuff.

518
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:15,633
If money is not
the treasure that you desire,

519
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:17,248
then say it.

520
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:21,958
What doth...

521
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:23,875
thy...

522
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:25,875
envision?

523
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:28,378
I want my own network talk show.

524
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:30,132
Five nights a week.

525
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,328
With an "Applause" sign and an audience.

526
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,793
I want people to laugh <i>with </i>me,

527
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:36,958
not <i>at </i>me.

528
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,707
Fulfill the contract,

529
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:42,417
you got a deal.

530
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:45,377
Ten of your dumb internet talk show

531
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:48,583
and you give me
a lifetime network talk show

532
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:49,747
Lifetime?

533
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:52,713
I'm a white man and I'm straight,
I deserve it.

534
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:56,997
Fine. Your own talk show
on the Lifetime network.

535
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,208
I'd take it.

536
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:00,998
I'd just take it now.

537
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,003
- Done.
- Done.

538
00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:10,792
I don't...

539
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:12,132
Please bow.

540
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,208
Are you...

541
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,080
I christen thee...

542
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:17,527
This is not a thing you do.

543
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,575
...worthy of the mantle
that is FOD.

544
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,922
Go on, young, pudgy Zach Galifianakis.

545
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,170
Ride your imaginary steed

546
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:29,997
through the hills and valleys

547
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,285
of this country

548
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,790
that we know

549
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,955
as America.

550
00:24:58,667 --> 00:24:59,707
Let's go!

551
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,750
Not in the front! Go around.

552
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,627
Hey, watch it!

553
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:10,503
Okay, guys,
Mr. Will Ferrell has promised

554
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
all of us

555
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:14,667
a new...

556
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:17,627
night-time network talk show.

557
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:20,082
<i>Whoa, he wants us all to work on it?</i>

558
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:21,247
Will Ferrell said this?

559
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,043
<i>Yep, he asked for you all by name,</i>

560
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:25,285
<i>and he decided to pay for our entire trip.</i>

561
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:27,955
So, let's go out
and film some celebrities!

562
00:25:28,042 --> 00:25:28,962
Who?

563
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:30,332
I'm not quite sure yet.

564
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,920
- Carol's looking into that and as soon...
- I am?

565
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,760
She didn't even know
what we were doing here,

566
00:25:34,792 --> 00:25:36,072
she's not looking into anything!

567
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:37,035
I'll start now.

568
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:38,915
She's fully aware of what's going on, Cam.

569
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,143
It's actually better that you don't know
what's going on.

570
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:44,627
Just point your camera
and shut the fuck up.

571
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:47,787
That's a nice thing to hear
as you're getting kidnapped.

572
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:50,575
And how long is this trip?

573
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,503
The trip should take us just two...

574
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,580
just two weeks.

575
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:55,851
- Two weeks?
- Wait, two weeks?

576
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:59,325
To get to the big time,
you gotta be a chance-taker.

577
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:00,707
<i>And I am a chance-taker.</i>

578
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:03,042
We're taking <i>Between Two Ferns</i>
on the road!

579
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,578
Oh! Hey, Zach?

580
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:07,423
Think I found someone.

581
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:10,145
- Oh, good!
- They're three hours away.

582
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:11,833
- No kidding?
- Yep.

583
00:26:11,917 --> 00:26:12,917
Who is it?

584
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:24,125
Hi, welcome to another edition
of <i>Between Two Ferns.</i>

585
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,788
I'm your host, Zach Galifianakis.

586
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:29,383
My guess today is
Santa Claus with an eating disorder.

587
00:26:30,792 --> 00:26:31,632
You look good.

588
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:32,788
Thanks, so do you.

589
00:26:32,917 --> 00:26:34,827
Did you just wake up from a 15-year nap?

590
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,253
You look like Steve Jobs now.

591
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:40,333
Okay.

592
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:43,632
Your Netflix show is called
<i>My Next Guest Needs No Introduction.</i>

593
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:47,125
Wouldn't a better title be
<i>My Next Show Will Have No Viewers?</i>

594
00:26:48,417 --> 00:26:50,627
Yeah, that... we considered that.

595
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,038
And that didn't test well?

596
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,920
Oh, I think it tested very well,

597
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,670
but it hurt my feelings.

598
00:26:56,042 --> 00:26:57,832
Tell me about your long beard.

599
00:26:57,917 --> 00:26:59,667
Is that a Stupid Human Trick?

600
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,210
Is it <i>Between Two Ferns</i>
or <i>Between the Ferns?</i>

601
00:27:02,292 --> 00:27:03,502
<i>Between Two Ferns.</i>

602
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:05,083
Yeah, but that's apparent.

603
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:06,247
Your show was on late.

604
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,833
Everybody knew it was late.
It was dark outside.

605
00:27:08,917 --> 00:27:10,226
Why did they call it the <i>Late Show</i>

606
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,559
- or whatever they call it?
- Mmm.

607
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:13,503
If you're going to get nitpicky
with titles of...

608
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:14,542
I'm just saying,

609
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:16,002
<i>Between the Ferns,</i> yes.

610
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:17,883
<i>Between Two Ferns, </i>oh!

611
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,790
One day you might go crazy
and add a third.

612
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:21,205
Then what are you going to do?

613
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:24,187
- I haven't thought about that.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

614
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:25,995
Plenty you haven't thought about.

615
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:28,378
Your son's name is Harry.

616
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:30,038
Did you name him after your face?

617
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:33,253
Named him after my late father.

618
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:35,745
How do you feel now?

619
00:27:35,917 --> 00:27:38,309
Well, I didn't know it was gonna go
into a bummer story like that.

620
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:39,173
No, I know.

621
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,790
But you don't have the capacity
for any sort of empathy or embarrassment.

622
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,540
<i>Can you take some constructive criticism?</i>

623
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:47,923
Yeah.

624
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,460
People find you unpleasant.

625
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:51,247
Mm. Thank you.

626
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:55,173
You love fast cars.

627
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:57,502
In what other ways is your penis small?

628
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,793
Can I just say something about this?

629
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:02,918
Not once has anyone discussed with me

630
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,880
my penis, my size of my penis,

631
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,540
my use of my penis,

632
00:28:07,917 --> 00:28:08,957
or my testicles.

633
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:12,002
So, I'm just curious
about the pathology behind this.

634
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:13,101
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

635
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,125
<i>What?</i>

636
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:16,583
What'd you say?

637
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,080
I said, "Jesus Christ."

638
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:20,787
Stop talk...
Do not editorialize right now, please.

639
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:24,205
It's hard not to let it out
when it's such a stupid thing you said.

640
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:28,934
It was a lot of fun, really.
Seriously. Thank you very much.

641
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:30,601
- Thank you.
- I know you gotta run, so, thanks.

642
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,495
Yeah, thank you.
I just wanted to say that...

643
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:35,997
you know, this has been
a real inspiration to me...

644
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,583
- ...'cause I want my own talk show.
- Good. Good. Great.

645
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:41,827
Nightly talk show, 'cause I think that'll
make me happy, like it made you happy.

646
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:44,787
Yeah, I'm sure it will.

647
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,205
Good luck on that.

648
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:49,292
- Okay.
- Make you happy!

649
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:51,285
- Right?
- Yeah!

650
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:52,748
- Yeah.
- Okay.

651
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:53,673
All right.

652
00:28:53,792 --> 00:28:55,934
- Thank you very much for your time.
- Which way do I go?

653
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:57,328
Right up there, where the guy is.

654
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
- Okay. Thank you.
- Yeah.

655
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,790
Okay. Bye-bye.

656
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,543
Try to stay off the grass.

657
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,893
- We're... in the grass.
- Thank you. All right, bye-bye.

658
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:07,577
Bye-bye. Take care.

659
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:10,125
<i>Whoa.</i>

660
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:12,832
- Hello.
<i>- What?</i>

661
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:15,417
What?

662
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,460
Okay, what's going on?

663
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:20,828
Are you gonna, like, make us all
smoosh in one shitty little room?

664
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:22,357
No, Cam, no one would room with you.

665
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:23,417
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

666
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:25,498
Four rooms, please.

667
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,101
- Four rooms?
- Four separate rooms.

668
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:29,035
One...

669
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:30,925
- We each getting our own room?
- Two...

670
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,130
three, and four.

671
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:33,828
- We each get our own room!
- Nice!

672
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:34,917
That's nice.

673
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,790
- Goodnight.
- Night.

674
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:43,667
God...

675
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,250
Carol!

676
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:49,393
Thanks so much for doing the show.
What are you doing in town?

677
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:51,497
Oh, I'm here working, uh,

678
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:53,252
on my foundation.

679
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,133
- What is it?
- Bones For Kids.

680
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:58,498
It's for kids that are born
without bones.

681
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:00,173
- God, that's terrible.
- I know.

682
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:01,625
How can I help?

683
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:04,538
You probably could stand
to donate some arm bones.

684
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:06,025
You don't need all those arm bones.

685
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,000
This one you can keep.

686
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,543
This one you can keep.

687
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:10,875
But, for some child,

688
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:12,247
that's a shin.

689
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:13,625
Hmm.

690
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:16,747
It seems like a bogus, like...

691
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,210
it's like a bogus charity thing,

692
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:21,712
kids without boners... Bones!

693
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,133
Without bones or something.

694
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:26,555
Why were you putting a paper up to your...

695
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,462
- I could totally hear you.
- Quiet.

696
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,880
Hi, welcome to another edition
of <i>Between Two Ferns.</i>

697
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:33,378
My guest today

698
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:34,958
is Paul Rudd.

699
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,502
- Thank you, Paul.
- Thank you.

700
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:38,792
Some people have it all.

701
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,630
Looks, talent.

702
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:43,248
How does it feel to only have looks?

703
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:45,583
Great.

704
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:47,285
If you didn't look the way you do,

705
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:49,559
instead of acting,
what do you think you would be doing?

706
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:50,583
Shoveling shit?

707
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,403
I read that you might quit acting

708
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:54,538
and just disappear?

709
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:56,788
Where did you read that?

710
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:59,167
Right here. I wrote it down.

711
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:01,537
Which do you prefer,

712
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:02,535
being in Marvel movies,

713
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:04,915
or being in stuff
that nobody has ever heard of?

714
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:07,788
Uh, being in Marvel movies.

715
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:09,455
Do you go to your acting coach and go,

716
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:12,132
"I've gotta play a goddamn ant,
what am I supposed to do?"

717
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:13,708
You lost me at "acting coach."

718
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:15,627
Yeah, that seems about right.

719
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,332
What advice would you give
to a young actor

720
00:31:18,417 --> 00:31:20,787
who wants to hide his Jewishness
as well as you have?

721
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:23,075
But I've never really tried
to hide my Jewishness.

722
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:26,077
"I've really never tried
to hide my Jewishness."

723
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:27,577
Yeah.

724
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:29,957
Jesus was Jewish and he didn't hide it.

725
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:33,285
No, he put it out there
for everybody to see.

726
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:35,205
He's one of our best.

727
00:31:35,292 --> 00:31:37,082
- Are you practicing?
<i>- No.</i>

728
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,830
I'm not a practicing Jew.

729
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:41,497
I perfected it.

730
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:50,828
- <i>Zach?</i>
- Yeah?

731
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:52,878
<i>Some bad news.</i>

732
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,710
Jake Gyllenhaal had to cancel.

733
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:56,792
Why?

734
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:58,753
He spelled his name wrong
on his plane ticket.

735
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,208
What?

736
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:01,672
It's too many As.

737
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,710
- I don't know what to do.
- Ah! Oh, my God! Zach!

738
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:09,753
Look over there! That's Chrissy Teigen!

739
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:11,417
She's a supermodel.

740
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
How super?

741
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,210
She's married to John Legend.

742
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:21,327
Go talk to her. You have to.

743
00:32:21,417 --> 00:32:22,417
- I can't.
- Get up!

744
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:24,955
Go! Go!

745
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:26,625
Okay.

746
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,750
- Hi.
- Hi.

747
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:34,542
Another Brandy Alexander, please.

748
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:40,245
- Hello.
- Oh, my God, I know you!

749
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,583
- You do?
- Oh, my God.

750
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:43,377
You are the <i>Between Two Ferns</i> guy.

751
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:44,918
I love your show.

752
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
You've seen my show?

753
00:32:46,292 --> 00:32:48,412
Yes, I've seen it, everybody's seen it.
It's so funny.

754
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,333
<i>You are so...</i>

755
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,750
uncomfortable,

756
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:53,582
and weird, and awkward,

757
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:55,957
<i>and all your guests,
like, you can tell they hate it,</i>

758
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:57,122
<i>- but they're there!</i>
- Yeah.

759
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,000
- I love it.
<i>- Not really what I'm going for, but...</i>

760
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:02,248
<i>- Sorry.</i>
- That's okay.

761
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,380
Can I ask you a question?

762
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:06,288
Shoot.

763
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:07,875
How did you get started?

764
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:10,673
How did you become...

765
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,130
<i>Everyone always asks me that,</i>

766
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,880
<i>and it's actually a really funny story.</i>

767
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,628
So, it's 2003,

768
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:18,418
this guy shows up at my door
with this box,

769
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,380
and there's this button inside,
and he says, "If you push this button,

770
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,788
- your greatest dream will come true...
- Hmm.

771
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:26,325
...but somebody, somewhere, will die."

772
00:33:27,042 --> 00:33:28,632
And so, I pushed it,

773
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:30,043
Mister Rogers died...

774
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:31,495
- What?
<i>- ...and here I am.</i>

775
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:34,601
Wait, because you pushed the button,
you think that's...

776
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:36,375
I mean, he had a good life, so...

777
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:41,377
- I had a guest that dropped out...
- Mm-hmm.

778
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:43,423
...just last-minute for my talk show.

779
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,420
Is there anyway I can interview you?

780
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,880
I actually have a better idea.

781
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:55,883
You're touching my hand.

782
00:33:56,542 --> 00:33:57,382
<i>Listen...</i>

783
00:33:57,458 --> 00:34:00,078
what if we take this upstairs?

784
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:03,077
What about John Legend?

785
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:06,667
He's fine, he's probably
at home polishing his EGOT.

786
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,170
Is that what he calls his penis?

787
00:34:20,167 --> 00:34:21,167
Come on.

788
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:35,248
That was at my hotel room.

789
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:36,503
How did you get that footage?

790
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:37,883
There are cameras everywhere.

791
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:39,498
You told me to never stop filming.

792
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:42,955
This whole trip, you've been filming me
in every hotel room that I've been in?

793
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:44,417
Yes.

794
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,540
Right. This is not in the documentary.

795
00:34:48,958 --> 00:34:49,958
Right?

796
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:52,167
At all.

797
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:54,207
Destroy it.

798
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:56,125
Now.

799
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:58,415
But before you do,
will you email me that?

800
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:06,853
<i>Hey, guys, welcome
to The Bear Pit. We cook with wood.</i>

801
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:09,168
Can I get you some honey gushers to start?

802
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:10,458
What are honey gushers?

803
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,500
It's just lemonade.

804
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:13,038
Wow, you really sell it.

805
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,170
Just telling it like it is.

806
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,920
I'll take the fried chicken plate.

807
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,460
I'll get pork ribs.

808
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:20,309
- I want the special. I want...
<i>- Special.</i>

809
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:22,043
- Do you have sushi?
<i>- I could...</i>

810
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:24,915
put some fish sticks
on a rice pilaf, I guess?

811
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,960
That's fine. Side of gravy.

812
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,684
Good enough.
I'll be right back with that, guys.

813
00:35:28,708 --> 00:35:30,601
- Thank you so much for your patience.
<i>- And your name is?</i>

814
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:32,143
- My name is Mike.
<i>- Thanks, Mike.</i>

815
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:34,087
- Thanks, Mike.
<i>- You can call me Michael.</i>

816
00:35:34,417 --> 00:35:35,417
Thanks, Mike.

817
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:37,173
That's great, actually. Wow.

818
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:39,625
- We're gonna go to the bathroom.
- Does he really?

819
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:40,883
Okay!

820
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:41,958
Thank you so much.

821
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:43,995
We got a celebrity!

822
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:45,083
Oh, good!

823
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:46,583
John Legend!

824
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:49,078
Oh, I'm so excited!

825
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:50,375
The...

826
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:52,535
Yes, the piano man, yeah!

827
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:54,726
He just called his manager out of the blue
this morning and was like,

828
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,500
"I wanna be on that show,"
and he's on a plane right now flying here.

829
00:35:57,917 --> 00:35:58,917
- Right now?
- Yes.

830
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:00,083
- Here?
<i>- He's rushed.</i>

831
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:03,875
Honestly, I've never heard someone
sound so excited to do our show.

832
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:08,875
Okay. Yeah, so...
when is he coming?

833
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,809
- He's gonna be here in a second.
- Where is he? Where is he though?

834
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:12,713
His team said he was minutes away.

835
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:14,268
There's a chance
I might leave during the interview.

836
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:15,632
- Zach!
- What?

837
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:17,875
Hi.

838
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:22,668
How are you, buddy?

839
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:24,537
So good to see you, man.

840
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:26,333
I'm so excited to be here.

841
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:27,625
Oh, good.

842
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:29,877
- Yeah, have... have a seat.
- Yeah.

843
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:30,995
- Okay.
- Okay.

844
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:31,923
Okay.

845
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,250
Oh! I've been wanting
to be on your show for so long.

846
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:36,973
I've been talking to my manager about it.

847
00:36:37,042 --> 00:36:39,059
- I'm so excited to be here.
- Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

848
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:40,383
Is everything okay, Zach?

849
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:41,934
Yeah, everything's... everything's fine,

850
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:45,288
I just get the pre-jo shitters sometime...
Uh, pre-show jitters sometimes.

851
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:46,708
Okay.

852
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:52,133
Hi, uh, welcome to another, uh,
edition of <i>Between Two Ferns.</i>

853
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:53,828
I'm your host, Zach Galifianakis,

854
00:36:53,917 --> 00:36:55,037
and my guest today

855
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,500
is John Legend.

856
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:58,213
- Hey, Zach!
- Hey, John.

857
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:00,458
Can I get an autograph for my mom?

858
00:37:00,542 --> 00:37:01,672
Sure, no problem.

859
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,040
- Because she wants to give it to her mom.
- Okay.

860
00:37:04,792 --> 00:37:06,042
Grandmas are great, too.

861
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:09,497
Are you okay with all this?

862
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:10,833
I'm so okay with it.

863
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:12,748
I'm having such a great time!

864
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:13,833
Are you having fun?

865
00:37:16,792 --> 00:37:18,672
We have something in common, uh...

866
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,170
which is we both
love to tickle the ivories.

867
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,490
You play the piano
and I love to make white people laugh.

868
00:37:24,917 --> 00:37:25,917
You're great!

869
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,330
This is good stuff.

870
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:31,083
You have many titles, uh...

871
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:32,417
musician, actor,

872
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,205
producer, philanthropist.

873
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:35,753
But at the end of the day,

874
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:38,193
aren't you just a millionaire
who's married to a supermodel?

875
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:45,377
I, uh, am married to a supermodel, yes.

876
00:37:46,042 --> 00:37:47,042
I'll look her up.

877
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:48,333
He met her.

878
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:49,327
- You met her?
- I did?

879
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:50,417
Yeah.

880
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:51,958
- When?
- Yes, of course.

881
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:53,542
In the bar.

882
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:55,293
<i>You met my wife in a bar?</i>

883
00:37:55,792 --> 00:37:57,434
I meet a lot of people.
I meet a lot of people.

884
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:58,828
It was last night.

885
00:37:59,167 --> 00:38:00,827
You met my wife last night?

886
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:03,018
- What does she look like?
<i>- She's gorgeous.</i>

887
00:38:03,042 --> 00:38:05,672
I told you, "Go over and talk to her,
we can get an interview."

888
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:08,132
I don't remember her.

889
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:09,928
Why are you
staring at me like this?

890
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:10,923
What?

891
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,143
I feel you're trying to communicate
something that I don't get.

892
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:14,377
Shut the fuck up.

893
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:19,458
Carol.

894
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Zach!

895
00:38:21,917 --> 00:38:22,997
That was fun, man.

896
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:24,417
Yeah.

897
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:25,625
Don't leave yet.

898
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:27,538
Give me a hug, brother.

899
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:28,917
Okay.

900
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:33,168
I know what you did.

901
00:38:35,958 --> 00:38:37,328
Ah!

902
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,000
God! God!

903
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:46,875
Yeah. I'll be out in a second.

904
00:38:47,042 --> 00:38:48,402
Just meet me at the back entrance.

905
00:38:49,792 --> 00:38:50,792
Zach?

906
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:51,923
What just happened?

907
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,750
He sprayed mace on my penis!

908
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:54,673
What did you do?

909
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:58,420
He's probably retaliating
'cause I had intercourse with his wife!

910
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,750
What?

911
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:03,745
I had sex with Chrissy Teigen.

912
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:04,963
No, you didn't.

913
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,920
Why else would he come
and spray me where it happened?

914
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,250
Ew.

915
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,960
It'll go away in, like, a half-hour.

916
00:39:11,042 --> 00:39:13,252
I've been sprayed before. It's not bad.

917
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:17,293
Oh, God!

918
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:25,793
Excuse me, Mr. Hamm?

919
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,375
- Hi!
<i>- Hi, my name is Zach,</i>

920
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:28,788
I have a public access talk show,

921
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:31,156
and I was wondering
if you would like to be a guest on it?

922
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:34,633
Absolutely.

923
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:36,498
Guys, we're gonna need
to take a quick break.

924
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,083
My friend Jack just asked me
to be on his TV show,

925
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:40,827
and I don't say no to anything, so...

926
00:39:40,917 --> 00:39:43,827
Thank you so much. Yeah.

927
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:47,328
The Me Too movement has been
an important learning process for men.

928
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:49,307
Do you feel like
you've missed out on that

929
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:52,175
because every woman you've ever met
just wants to fuck your brains out?

930
00:39:53,292 --> 00:39:56,882
Bradley Cooper co-wrote, produced,
directed, and starred in <i>A Star is Born.</i>

931
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:57,878
I hear it's great.

932
00:39:57,958 --> 00:40:00,788
Are you hoping that will open doors
for other hot idiots?

933
00:40:01,917 --> 00:40:03,457
Uh, you know...

934
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:06,212
At what point during the making of <i>Tag</i>
did you guys realize

935
00:40:06,292 --> 00:40:10,212
that you were making one of the most
iconic pieces of mediocrity ever produced?

936
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:15,543
I get it!

937
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:19,707
My guest today is Hailee Steinfeld.

938
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,792
All right.

939
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:23,128
- Nice to have you here, Sta... Stailee...
- Thank...

940
00:40:23,208 --> 00:40:25,128
To have... Nice to hear... Have...

941
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:26,958
Nice to have you here, Stailee.

942
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,210
You were in <i>Pitch Perfect 2</i> and <i>3.</i>

943
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:31,133
Do you ever wish
you had been in the good one?

944
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:34,958
You have 12 million Instagram followers.

945
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:38,502
How long did it take you to apologize
to each one of them for <i>Bumblebee?</i>

946
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:40,922
<i>I walked out of that movie.</i>

947
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,420
I'm just kidding,
I didn't walk out of the movie.

948
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:46,498
<i>I skipped out
'cause I was so happy to be leaving.</i>

949
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:47,583
Wow.

950
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:49,995
You dated a guy from One Direction.

951
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:53,080
Which one direction
was his penis pointing, north or south?

952
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:56,583
Are we done?

953
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:00,212
Hey, Zach, could I get this?

954
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,772
Absolutely. Matter of fact,
if you guys want some trinkets too,

955
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:04,133
it's on me. My treat.

956
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,290
My guest today is...

957
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:14,375
Aquafina.

958
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:15,583
Awkwafina.

959
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:16,747
Like the water?

960
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:18,883
Well, it's spelled differently, so...

961
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:21,078
You've been raping since the age of 13...

962
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:22,167
Rapping.

963
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:24,038
- Rapping.
- That makes more sense.

964
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,333
You starred in, um, <i>Ocean's 8.</i>

965
00:41:27,417 --> 00:41:28,327
It's a great movie.

966
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:31,077
I'd love to see an all-male
reboot of <i>Ocean's 8.</i>

967
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:32,880
- That would be nice.
- Yeah.

968
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:34,708
There... It exists already.

969
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:35,875
Couple of them.

970
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:38,667
Couple of what?
Male versions of the female <i>Ocean's 8?</i>

971
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,210
<i>Ocean's 8 </i>was a reboot of a male...

972
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:42,059
Next thing you're gonna tell me
there's a male <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

973
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,083
There is.

974
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,960
- It's with, um...
- Leslie Jones.

975
00:41:46,042 --> 00:41:47,042
No.

976
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:53,247
You got famous for peeing from a zip line.

977
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:54,463
What's your next project?

978
00:41:54,542 --> 00:41:55,922
Queefing on a ski lift?

979
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:58,133
No, I already queefed on a podcast.

980
00:41:58,208 --> 00:42:00,168
Is that how you got your nickname,
Queef Latifah?

981
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:01,463
Possibly.

982
00:42:01,542 --> 00:42:04,172
Do you ever wish people would stop
calling you a female comedian?

983
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:05,625
Yeah.

984
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:07,987
Don't you think they should
just call you a black comedian?

985
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:10,833
It's better than them
calling me a male comedian.

986
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:13,002
You were raised in the foster care system,

987
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:15,543
which brings us to our sponsor,
Foster's beer.

988
00:42:15,875 --> 00:42:17,495
Can you look at this camera right here

989
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:19,003
and say,

990
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:20,393
"Foster beer,

991
00:42:20,417 --> 00:42:22,287
the best beer for foster kids."

992
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:23,375
I'm not doing that.

993
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:24,583
No.

994
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:47,328
Hey, can I just take a second?
I wanted to, um...

995
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,580
I just want to thank you guys

996
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:53,333
for going on this venture with me,
and, uh...

997
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:55,293
this has been a dream of mine.

998
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,290
As a kid, I realized that people

999
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,625
love to point and laugh
and look at me.

1000
00:43:01,042 --> 00:43:02,132
And I knew then...

1001
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:04,457
I have the It Factor.

1002
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:09,325
So, I just wanted to thank you guys
for helping me capitalize on that.

1003
00:43:09,958 --> 00:43:10,958
<i>Hey, I want to say,</i>

1004
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:13,133
when we first started
on this whole trip,

1005
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:15,668
I found you to be annoying
and hard to be around,

1006
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,750
and that hasn't changed.

1007
00:43:18,958 --> 00:43:20,328
I'm kidding!

1008
00:43:20,417 --> 00:43:21,247
Ha!

1009
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:22,684
- Yeah, I know! Yeah.
- That's why it's funny,

1010
00:43:22,708 --> 00:43:24,458
'cause it has changed.
I actually,

1011
00:43:24,917 --> 00:43:26,077
you know, I think...

1012
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:28,207
I don't know, I kinda...

1013
00:43:28,292 --> 00:43:29,172
I like you.

1014
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,790
- Wow.
- Well...

1015
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:32,498
thank you, Cam.

1016
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:33,583
You're welcome.

1017
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:36,165
Well, I'd like to say
a little something, too.

1018
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,710
Ever since my dad shot my mom
and then killed himself,

1019
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:40,292
I felt kind of...

1020
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:41,423
unmoored,

1021
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,790
but you've made me really
feel stable and needed.

1022
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:45,325
- So, thank you so much.
- What?

1023
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:49,290
Oh, yeah, my dad killed my mom
then killed himself, 'cause...

1024
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,455
- When... when did that happen?
- A while ago.

1025
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:52,625
Like, a month.

1026
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:56,035
You didn't take any time off of work,
you didn't say anything?

1027
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:57,125
I'm fine.

1028
00:43:58,625 --> 00:43:59,535
I'd like to do a toast,

1029
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:00,726
- if that's possible?
- Yeah.

1030
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:01,830
- Yeah.
- Let's do a toast.

1031
00:44:01,917 --> 00:44:02,917
Okay.

1032
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:05,253
Here's to the crazy ones,

1033
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:07,167
the misfits,

1034
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:08,667
maniacs,

1035
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
to the loonies,

1036
00:44:10,542 --> 00:44:11,542
and ding-dongs.

1037
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:14,415
And some people would say
that we're the crazy ones,

1038
00:44:14,958 --> 00:44:15,958
but I think...

1039
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,580
we're geniuses,

1040
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:19,328
because we're...

1041
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:20,915
crazy enough

1042
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:25,495
to try to change
this ding-dong crazy world.

1043
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:27,632
Cheers.

1044
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:29,498
That was a great speech.

1045
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:32,253
Would you like to, uh, dance?

1046
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:34,250
With me, though.

1047
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:35,583
- Yes. Okay.
- Okay.

1048
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:43,495
You wanna dance?

1049
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:44,633
I wanna dance alone.

1050
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:51,957
<i>Come on, Cam!</i>

1051
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:53,378
<i>Come on.</i>

1052
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:13,583
Hello.

1053
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:14,955
Hi.

1054
00:45:15,042 --> 00:45:16,082
Room 203.

1055
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:18,497
There should be some...
several rooms under that.

1056
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:20,333
Yes, here's your receipt.

1057
00:45:21,458 --> 00:45:23,038
I hope you enjoyed your stay.

1058
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,500
Very much.

1059
00:45:25,542 --> 00:45:26,832
What are all these charges?

1060
00:45:26,917 --> 00:45:27,997
It's itemized, sir.

1061
00:45:28,542 --> 00:45:31,172
I just, I didn't realize
when you take out the, um,

1062
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,750
the crackers in the snack drawer
that they charge you for it or the drinks.

1063
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:36,883
You didn't realize that?

1064
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:39,726
Well, I didn't know, like, even if you
put it back, you're still charged.

1065
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:42,880
If you eat it or drink it, yes.

1066
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:44,288
Did you eat the stuff, too?

1067
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:45,875
I moved it and then I ate it, yeah.

1068
00:45:46,042 --> 00:45:49,002
But, just 'cause I move it
I shouldn't be charged.

1069
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:50,793
What are these? Those look like...

1070
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:52,462
I rented one movie.

1071
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,125
Big deal.

1072
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:56,333
Is that porn?

1073
00:45:57,083 --> 00:45:59,503
I thought it was <i>Analyze This,</i>
but it was <i>Anal-yze This.</i>

1074
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:02,018
They didn't even have to change
the spelling of it.

1075
00:46:02,042 --> 00:46:04,672
You rented <i>Anal-yze This</i>
several times in a row.

1076
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:07,710
I kept hitting it 'cause I was,
"Well, maybe <i>Analyze This </i>will come..."

1077
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:09,503
The point being is...

1078
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:12,225
You should see the guy they had
playing Billy Crystal, by the way.

1079
00:46:13,542 --> 00:46:15,726
- I'm not paying for this.
- You've already paid for it.

1080
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:16,960
This is just your receipt.

1081
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:20,213
But, I'm saying
I'm not paying for it... again.

1082
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:27,538
- I'm hungry.
- I'm starving.

1083
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:28,535
I'm so hungry.

1084
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:30,705
You guys wanna do
a family-style type thing?

1085
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:34,042
No, I think we each
wanted to get our own thing.

1086
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,035
- I was...
- Hey, gang.

1087
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,125
Did you get a chance
to look at the menus here?

1088
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:38,248
I'll take a grape juice...

1089
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:41,003
Uh, no, we'll have, uh,
four waters for the table.

1090
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:41,923
No grape juice.

1091
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,380
Can I get an orange soda?

1092
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:44,643
- Okay, orange...
- We'll split.

1093
00:46:44,667 --> 00:46:46,147
Maybe we can split a soda three ways.

1094
00:46:46,208 --> 00:46:48,038
Can you do one soda with two extra cups,

1095
00:46:48,125 --> 00:46:51,285
but just charge us once, and then
put the other two, just put refills in it?

1096
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:52,495
It just has to be...

1097
00:46:52,708 --> 00:46:54,748
one cup you all share.

1098
00:46:55,042 --> 00:46:57,042
I can bring four straws?

1099
00:46:57,167 --> 00:46:58,377
Sweet. Cool.

1100
00:46:58,458 --> 00:47:00,378
How many clam strips come in an order?

1101
00:47:00,458 --> 00:47:01,498
Six.

1102
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:04,333
- How big are they?
- Well, have you ever seen a chicken strip?

1103
00:47:05,042 --> 00:47:06,922
I've never seen a chicken wear clothes.

1104
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:10,875
No, I mean like baked into a strip, not...

1105
00:47:12,542 --> 00:47:13,792
- You bake them?
- That's fine.

1106
00:47:13,875 --> 00:47:17,285
One is good. Look, we'll get an order
of the clam strips and a scoop of tuna.

1107
00:47:17,542 --> 00:47:19,172
And can I get a, uh...

1108
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,580
mug of hot water, please?

1109
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:25,575
<i>What were you saying earlier</i>

1110
00:47:25,667 --> 00:47:28,627
about your buddy Martin Freeman
being the only good part of <i>Black Panther?</i>

1111
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:29,538
What?

1112
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:31,825
It's just a weird thing to say
to someone you just met.

1113
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,670
- But I didn't say that.
- Ready?

1114
00:47:34,042 --> 00:47:36,962
Hi, welcome to another edition
of <i>Between Two Ferns.</i>

1115
00:47:37,042 --> 00:47:39,252
I'm your host,
Zach Galifianakis, and...

1116
00:47:39,708 --> 00:47:41,418
my guest today is

1117
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,750
Benedick Cumberbut... Batch.

1118
00:47:44,417 --> 00:47:46,627
Benedick, Benedick Cumberbat... Bun.

1119

Cam...

1120
00:47:48,667 --> 00:47:49,707
Benedick Cam...

1121
00:47:50,458 --> 00:47:51,458
Benefit Lumberjacks.

1122
00:47:51,542 --> 00:47:52,672
Ju... Uh, Bit...

1123
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:53,934
- Uh, Benedict...
- Cumberdit...

1124
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:55,128
Cumberba... Uh...

1125
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,170
Benedict Cumberbatch.

1126
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:58,705
- That's what it is.
- Yeah.

1127
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,422
You once said
you're your own worst critic.

1128
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:04,173
So, you haven't read any of your reviews?

1129
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:05,250
No, no, I try not to.

1130
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:06,976
Has there ever been
anything negative written about...

1131
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1132
00:48:08,583 --> 00:48:10,253
A horse-faced, wooden...

1133
00:48:10,667 --> 00:48:12,518
- I see that, now you say that.
- ...oddly-named.

1134
00:48:12,542 --> 00:48:14,172
- That I do see.
- Yeah.

1135
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:17,213
You got your start doing theater
and independent films.

1136
00:48:17,292 --> 00:48:18,292
I did.

1137
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:20,213
And now you're acting
in Marvel movies.

1138
00:48:20,292 --> 00:48:22,042
How good does it feel to sell-out?

1139
00:48:24,042 --> 00:48:25,502
Uh, I don't think it's a sell-out.

1140
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:27,293
I think they're pretty cool films.

1141
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:29,625
There's a lot for an actor to do in them.
So...

1142
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:30,708
You wear a cape?

1143
00:48:30,917 --> 00:48:31,997
No, I wear a cloak.

1144
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:38,962
Do you think you play smart characters
like Sherlock Holmes because you have...

1145
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,630
you have one of these,
you know, these faces...

1146
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:44,628
Can we... Is there a...
Let's just get a close-up here.

1147
00:48:44,708 --> 00:48:46,378
It's a face that could go either way.

1148
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:48,995
It can use inductive reasoning
to solve mysteries,

1149
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:50,713
or it's the type of face that...

1150
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:53,043
masturbates all day wearing a helmet.

1151
00:48:53,875 --> 00:48:55,035
See, it's a fine line.

1152
00:48:57,042 --> 00:48:59,252
You played Vincent van Gogh in a movie.

1153
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:00,633
I did, yes.

1154
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:03,325
This is Vincent van Gogh
answering his cell phone.

1155
00:49:04,292 --> 00:49:05,292
Hello...

1156
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:06,625
Hello?

1157
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:08,750
It's hilarious.

1158
00:49:09,292 --> 00:49:10,712
If you didn't have an accent,

1159
00:49:10,792 --> 00:49:13,792
do you think people would be able
to tell that you're not a very good actor?

1160
00:49:14,083 --> 00:49:16,583
Yeah, no, I think my accent
probably does help, that's true.

1161
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:17,957
Can you do an American accent?

1162
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:19,632
Yes, I can.

1163
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:20,830
Um...

1164
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,665
okay, maybe I'll give you a few words?

1165
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:23,580
Sure.

1166
00:49:23,667 --> 00:49:26,417
That's a nice bicycle you have there,
my young son.

1167
00:49:29,125 --> 00:49:32,285
Well, that's a nice
bicycle you have there, my young son.

1168
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:35,958
- Pervert. Get away from me.
- Pervert. Get away from me.

1169
00:49:36,042 --> 00:49:38,202
- No, that's me responding.
- No, that's me responding.

1170
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:42,458
- You have a rabid fan base, and it's...
- A what?

1171
00:49:42,542 --> 00:49:44,862
- You have a rabid...
- I thought you said "rabbit." Sorry.

1172
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,290
Why... I said rabid.

1173
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:48,495
It's vowels with you,

1174
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:50,673
so I can't sometimes
understand what you're saying.

1175
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:53,170
All right, I'll say "rabbit."
You have a "rabbit" fan base.

1176
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:54,559
- That what you want?
- No, just "d", "d".

1177
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:56,883
You have a fan base full of rabbits.

1178
00:49:56,958 --> 00:49:57,958
Rabid.

1179
00:49:58,667 --> 00:50:00,827
Do they fuck a lot
while they come see your plays?

1180
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:03,417
Are the rabbits always
having sex in the audience,

1181
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,500
- while...
- Unbelievable.

1182
00:50:04,583 --> 00:50:06,793
Are you good friends
with the Easter Bunny?

1183
00:50:07,125 --> 00:50:08,575
Do you know Bugs?

1184
00:50:17,417 --> 00:50:19,127
Everything, uh, everything good?

1185
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:21,458
You got kinda heated in there with...

1186
00:50:21,542 --> 00:50:24,132
with Cumber... Cumercleat...
Cumbercleatch.

1187
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:26,078
It's Dickerflick Cabbagepatch.

1188
00:50:26,167 --> 00:50:28,287
<i>I just... Look, I...</i>

1189
00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:31,962
I don't wanna put this on you guys,
but, uh...

1190
00:50:32,417 --> 00:50:33,707
we're in a little bit of a...

1191
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:37,253
budget situation,
we're strapped for cash right now.

1192
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:39,753
That's okay, you can just
call Will Ferrell.

1193
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:41,143
- Oh, yeah.
- He can send more money.

1194
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:42,167
I'll call him right now.

1195
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:43,893
- Don't do...
- How do you spell Ferrell?

1196
00:50:43,917 --> 00:50:44,917
Don't do that.

1197
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:49,075
When I said that he was
bankrolling this project,

1198
00:50:49,167 --> 00:50:50,167
I meant...

1199
00:50:50,333 --> 00:50:53,133
I meant he was bankrolling it
in the future tense.

1200
00:50:53,708 --> 00:50:54,708
What?

1201
00:50:54,792 --> 00:50:56,632
He didn't give us any money upfront,

1202
00:50:56,708 --> 00:50:58,168
and we're running low.

1203
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:00,040
So, you lied about Will Ferrell?

1204
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:01,125
Oh, that's great.

1205
00:51:01,167 --> 00:51:04,287
Let me guess, he never actually said
that we could be a part of the show?

1206
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:05,825
Did you lie about that, too?

1207
00:51:05,917 --> 00:51:08,377
As soon as we get to Los Angeles,
everything will be fine.

1208
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:09,918
I'm not gonna leave you guys behind.

1209
00:51:10,958 --> 00:51:11,958
We're friends.

1210
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Oh, are we?

1211
00:51:13,417 --> 00:51:15,667
Are we? Or are we just
a bunch of dumb shits

1212
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:18,625
<i>that you tricked
into doing unpaid labor for you?</i>

1213
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:19,708
Come on. Come on.

1214
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:25,583
Carol...

1215
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:42,035
- Hi, Norma!
- Hi, Tessa!

1216
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:44,268
What are you doing out here
in the middle of nowhere anyway?

1217
00:51:44,292 --> 00:51:46,582
I'm researching for a film
that I'm doing next.

1218
00:51:46,667 --> 00:51:47,667
What kind of research?

1219
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:50,380
I'm just learning
how to be a boring person.

1220
00:51:50,458 --> 00:51:51,498
Oh, really?

1221
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:53,455
My guest today is...

1222
00:51:54,042 --> 00:51:55,332
Tesla Thompson.

1223
00:51:55,458 --> 00:51:56,768
- Tesla? Tesla Thompson?
- Tessa.

1224
00:51:56,792 --> 00:51:58,792
No, Tes... Yeah, just Tessa.

1225
00:51:58,875 --> 00:51:59,875
Like the car.

1226
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:01,476
- No, no, unlike the car.
- Tesla, like the car?

1227
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,393
- Like, if you take the "L" out of it.
- But, it says,

1228
00:52:03,417 --> 00:52:04,417
"Tessa...

1229
00:52:04,542 --> 00:52:06,502
parenthetically, like the car."

1230
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:08,434
But, you don't say it
like you say the car.

1231
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,828
'Cause then that's not my name.

1232
00:52:09,917 --> 00:52:11,127
I drive a Tessa.

1233
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:12,625
You were in Creed.

1234
00:52:12,667 --> 00:52:13,667
Mm-hmm.

1235
00:52:13,708 --> 00:52:15,128
What's Scott Stapp like?

1236
00:52:15,208 --> 00:52:17,128
- Who?
- The singer in your band.

1237
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:19,708
Were you in Cr...
It says you were in Creed.

1238
00:52:19,792 --> 00:52:21,252
No, the movie, not the band.

1239
00:52:21,958 --> 00:52:23,578
Oh. Well, what's Scott Stapp like?

1240
00:52:24,542 --> 00:52:27,582
I never... I didn't...
We didn't meet 'cause I'm...

1241
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:29,418
They weren't involved in the movie.

1242
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,330
But, would you like to meet him one day?

1243
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:34,078
I mean, yeah, sure,

1244
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:37,707
if the opportunity presented itself
and I didn't have to drive anywhere, yeah.

1245
00:52:38,292 --> 00:52:41,082
Women are always being told
to watch their weight in Hollywood.

1246
00:52:41,167 --> 00:52:44,827
So, why do you think so many actresses
could still stand to lose a few pounds?

1247
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:46,710
I mean, you look at Hollywood

1248
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:48,792
and all the men
that get to age gracefully.

1249
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:52,075
It looks like they haven't been to a gym,

1250
00:52:52,167 --> 00:52:54,037
they get to come in disheveled,

1251
00:52:54,125 --> 00:52:55,955
and they look like they need to shower,

1252
00:52:56,042 --> 00:52:58,332
and they're wearing
just, like, some blazer,

1253
00:52:58,417 --> 00:53:00,627
and be told
that they just look distinguished,

1254
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:01,918
but really they just look...

1255
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:04,077
pretty disgusting, so...

1256
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:05,708
Yeah, I hear you.

1257
00:53:05,917 --> 00:53:07,268
That's... that's gotta be frustrating.

1258
00:53:07,292 --> 00:53:08,292
Yeah.

1259
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:14,788
- So this like a shortcut?
- Where are we going?

1260
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:16,893
I don't know if this
is where you check in, or...

1261
00:53:16,917 --> 00:53:17,747
Now what?

1262
00:53:17,875 --> 00:53:20,355
- What do you mean?
- We'll see what's going on.

1263
00:53:26,542 --> 00:53:28,184
- This looks weird.
- Where are we?

1264
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:29,578
This where we're staying tonight.

1265
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:32,375
You said we were staying
at the Four Seasons.

1266
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:37,495
I said that we were staying at a place
that was closed for three of the seasons.

1267
00:53:37,583 --> 00:53:38,893
Oh, Jesus Christ.
We're supposed to believe that?

1268
00:53:38,917 --> 00:53:40,393
That's exactly what I said
and for you guys

1269
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:42,097
to run your mouths
like it was something...

1270
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:44,625
You are a liar and you have deceived us.

1271
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:46,708
Yes, it's an abandoned campground,

1272
00:53:46,792 --> 00:53:49,332
but let's just stay here for the night
and have some fun.

1273
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,250
He's crazy. He's literally losing it.

1274
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:54,809
He's under a lot of stress.

1275
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:57,083
But, we only have one more episode to go.

1276
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:58,407
Hey, Zach found a fishing pole,

1277
00:53:58,458 --> 00:54:00,698
so we're gonna go on the lake
and try to catch something.

1278
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:07,325
Let me put the hot dog on it.

1279
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:09,165
- You have a hot dog?
- Yeah.

1280
00:54:09,792 --> 00:54:10,792
We could've eaten that.

1281
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:11,833
You want a piece?

1282
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:13,893
- No, I don't wanna a piece.
- I can give you that one.

1283
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,327
It's been in your pocket all day.

1284
00:54:15,417 --> 00:54:17,417
It's only two days old, it's fine.
Hot dogs keep.

1285
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,250
- Use it.
- Fine.

1286
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,580
Just give me a second.

1287
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:29,833
You get caught?

1288
00:54:30,458 --> 00:54:31,998
- You gotta get it...
- God Almighty!

1289
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:34,825
Hey.

1290
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:38,208
What's going on?

1291
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:39,708
I just feel like...

1292
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:41,790
What are we doing?

1293
00:54:42,542 --> 00:54:46,252
I... I'm fishing on a giant goose
looking for food.

1294
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:47,995
You got this.

1295
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,500
You're gonna catch us fish for dinner,

1296
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:52,583
we're all going to eat like kings tonight.

1297
00:54:53,292 --> 00:54:56,212
And you're gonna make a TV show
that's going to change the entire world.

1298
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Okay?

1299
00:54:58,583 --> 00:54:59,583
I believe in you.

1300
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:02,420
You can't just give up
when someone believes in you.

1301
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:09,693
I don't know what I'd do without you,
Carol, I really don't.

1302
00:55:14,208 --> 00:55:16,498
If you could do anything with your life,
what would it be?

1303
00:55:17,458 --> 00:55:18,458
Forget me,

1304
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:20,003
forget the cable access.

1305
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:21,083
What would you do?

1306
00:55:21,458 --> 00:55:23,828
Once upon a time,
I thought about being a trumpet player.

1307
00:55:25,833 --> 00:55:28,383
That was right before we left
on this trip. I bought a trumpet.

1308
00:55:32,292 --> 00:55:33,792
- That was in your purse?
- Yeah.

1309
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:36,288
Just in case I ever get the guts
to give it a toot.

1310
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:38,673
Well, what are you afraid of?

1311
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:41,705
I'm scared I might be too good at it,

1312
00:55:42,292 --> 00:55:43,372
and I'll have to leave you.

1313
00:55:44,042 --> 00:55:45,212
Well, then you become...

1314
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:48,752
a famous trumpeter
and you leave me behind. It's okay.

1315
00:55:49,167 --> 00:55:50,917
If you wanna play the trumpet, go ahead.

1316
00:55:51,542 --> 00:55:53,462
Lip up. Give that thing a toot.

1317
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:55,333
Okay.

1318
00:55:55,875 --> 00:55:56,875
Okay!

1319
00:55:58,833 --> 00:56:00,713
I watched a ton of videos
on how to do it.

1320
00:56:19,917 --> 00:56:20,747
It's a good start.

1321
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:22,043
You play that trumpet.

1322
00:56:22,667 --> 00:56:24,037
I'm gonna catch us some fish.

1323
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:39,248
Okay, everybody.
Can everybody gather round, please?

1324
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:40,625
Gather round.

1325
00:56:40,958 --> 00:56:41,958
All right.

1326
00:56:42,042 --> 00:56:43,832
So, we're at Peter Dinklage's house.

1327
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,790
This is our last interview.
Obviously, he's as rich as Croesus.

1328
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:48,458
I have a plan.

1329
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,290
Carol, he's going to be distracted
during the interview.

1330
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:54,003
I need you to steal some of his stuff.

1331
00:56:54,583 --> 00:56:55,923
- What?
- What? No!

1332
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,601
- We're not stealing!
- You can't do that. No.

1333
00:56:57,625 --> 00:57:00,455
I know... Not a lot of stuff,
just enough stuff so I can sell it later,

1334
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,422
so we have some dough.

1335
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:04,018
- I don't feel comfortable with that.
<i>- You don't have to do that.</i>

1336
00:57:04,042 --> 00:57:05,132
Okay, I'll do it.

1337
00:57:05,792 --> 00:57:07,872
You have to work the camera.
Plus, you're too stupid.

1338
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:09,833
Carol,

1339
00:57:09,958 --> 00:57:11,328
if we don't get to Los Angeles...

1340
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:14,253
our talk show dreams are over.

1341
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:17,708
Please?

1342
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:21,333
Okay.

1343
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,920
Let's steal Peter Dinklage's stuff.

1344
00:57:24,583 --> 00:57:25,713
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1345
00:57:25,792 --> 00:57:26,792
Okay!

1346
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:28,628
Game faces! Let's go.

1347
00:57:29,125 --> 00:57:30,995
All right. I'll get the ferns.

1348
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:39,000
Hey, yeah,

1349
00:57:39,292 --> 00:57:41,172
the <i>Ferns </i>peoples.

1350
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:42,542
Come on.

1351
00:57:45,167 --> 00:57:46,377
<i>Come on, don't be shy.</i>

1352
00:57:47,792 --> 00:57:49,212
Late one last night.

1353
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:50,750
Oh, wow.

1354
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:52,503
What a fancy house.

1355
00:57:52,833 --> 00:57:54,963
Tell us about
all of your expensive things.

1356
00:57:55,375 --> 00:57:56,875
All right.

1357
00:57:57,667 --> 00:57:59,377
I was just about to anyway.

1358
00:57:59,458 --> 00:58:01,578
You're noticing my Warhol, I see.

1359
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:03,250
Wow.

1360
00:58:03,292 --> 00:58:04,462
Must be really expensive.

1361
00:58:04,542 --> 00:58:07,962
Oh, about 250K. Got that for a steal.

1362
00:58:08,042 --> 00:58:09,632
Was LaCroix around back then?

1363
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:10,708
<i>Yeah.</i>

1364
00:58:10,917 --> 00:58:11,827
<i>LaCroix!</i>

1365
00:58:11,917 --> 00:58:14,377
Seems like it must be
hard to get that off the wall.

1366
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Over here...

1367
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,130
<i>Winds Of Winter</i> by George R.R. Martin?

1368
00:58:21,583 --> 00:58:22,713
It's not even out yet!

1369
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:25,282
I bet that would fetch a pretty penny
on the open market.

1370
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:27,208
Check this out.

1371
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:31,880
<i>Et voilà.</i>

1372
00:58:32,917 --> 00:58:34,417
Are those Fabergé eggs?

1373
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,830
Yes, they are indeed.

1374
00:58:35,917 --> 00:58:36,747
Wow.

1375
00:58:36,917 --> 00:58:39,207
You know what's the most amazing thing
about this, though?

1376
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:40,583
Uh...

1377
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:42,627
Fabergé egg carton.

1378
00:58:43,083 --> 00:58:44,083
Wow.

1379
00:58:44,375 --> 00:58:46,018
- Is that worth a lot of money?
- Oh...

1380
00:58:46,042 --> 00:58:47,462
- Like, how much?
- Oh...

1381
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:49,540
You can't even
think of a number that high.

1382
00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:50,665
Okay, great.

1383
00:58:51,167 --> 00:58:52,917
Thank you.
We'll set up for the interview.

1384
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,101
So, we're gonna do the interview?

1385
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:55,125
Let's do it.

1386
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:02,457
Hi, welcome to another edition
of <i>Between Two Ferns.</i>

1387
00:59:02,542 --> 00:59:04,632
I'm your host, Zach Galifianakis,

1388
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,208
and my guest today...

1389
00:59:06,667 --> 00:59:08,167
is Peter Dinklage.

1390
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,290
Thank you for joining me, Mr. Dinklage.

1391
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:12,463
Mm-hmm.

1392
00:59:12,542 --> 00:59:13,542
Dinklage.

1393
00:59:14,208 --> 00:59:15,498
Is that an STD?

1394
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,670
Uh, I think in German
it's von Dincklage, but...

1395
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,290
Why did you keep your real name?

1396
00:59:22,167 --> 00:59:23,747
I mean, if someone said to me,

1397
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:28,213
"You have to start an acting career
with the name Peter Dinkylage..."

1398
00:59:28,292 --> 00:59:30,672
I'm thinking of other choices
I could've made right now.

1399
00:59:31,667 --> 00:59:33,497
Well, Galifianakis is a stage name.

1400
00:59:33,917 --> 00:59:34,827
What's your real name?

1401
00:59:34,917 --> 00:59:37,287
My real name is Chad Farthouse.

1402
00:59:38,417 --> 00:59:39,667
That doesn't sound right.

1403
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,880
There's a kid
on the Disney Channel.

1404
00:59:42,208 --> 00:59:43,828
Uh, Chad...

1405
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:45,080
Farthouse.

1406
00:59:45,167 --> 00:59:47,327
He's on one of...
<i>Wizards Of Waverly Place,</i>

1407
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:48,832
with that last name.

1408
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:50,417
So, I had to change my name.

1409
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,670
You're in <i>X-Men, </i>right?

1410
00:59:55,417 --> 00:59:56,997
You know who my favorite X-Man is?

1411
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:58,750
Caitlyn Jenner.

1412
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:01,422
And, by the way,
that's not an offensive joke.

1413
01:00:01,792 --> 01:00:05,172
I'm honestly under the impression
that she was in the <i>X-Men </i>movies.

1414
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:08,998
You were in <i>ALF, </i>right?

1415
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:10,583
<i>Elf.</i>

1416
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,710
No, I mean, you were in ALF,
the costume?

1417
01:00:14,458 --> 01:00:16,458
- Um, hey!
- Can I just...

1418
01:00:16,875 --> 01:00:17,875
Real quick,

1419
01:00:18,125 --> 01:00:19,434
and it's important you look at my face

1420
01:00:19,458 --> 01:00:21,378
'cause I think
the sincerity in this question

1421
01:00:21,458 --> 01:00:22,878
is reading in my face.

1422
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:26,003
Tell us about how fun it was
to be in <i>Pixels.</i>

1423
01:00:26,125 --> 01:00:28,205
<i>Pixels, </i>was that a fun challenge?

1424
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:29,538
Hey...

1425
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:30,745
she's taking my eggs!

1426
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:32,173
- Hey, wait!
- Okay. Let's go!

1427
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:34,040
- Hey!
- Let's go! Grab it! Go!

1428
01:00:34,125 --> 01:00:34,955
Grab what you can!

1429
01:00:35,042 --> 01:00:36,712
- Go!
- What the heck are you doing?

1430
01:00:36,792 --> 01:00:39,032
- What are you doing? Those are my eggs!
- Go! Go!

1431
01:00:39,083 --> 01:00:40,601
<i>My precious eggs!</i>

1432
01:00:40,625 --> 01:00:41,995
<i>No!</i>

1433
01:00:42,167 --> 01:00:44,537
- Loved you in <i>Three Billboards!</i>
- Shit!

1434
01:00:44,833 --> 01:00:47,003
Why didn't I get attack dogs?

1435
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:48,750
Well, I...

1436
01:00:49,292 --> 01:00:51,292
still have $102 million dollars

1437
01:00:51,875 --> 01:00:54,035
in my savings account alone. Ah.

1438
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,130
You'll be fine, Peter.

1439
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:57,503
You're a survivor.

1440
01:00:57,833 --> 01:00:59,003
You will survive.

1441
01:01:03,167 --> 01:01:05,567
So, guys, got a little cash
from selling Mr. Dinklage's eggs.

1442
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:08,205
Now, all we have to do
is get to Los Angeles by 9:00 a.m.,

1443
01:01:08,375 --> 01:01:10,495
- and get this show to Mr. Will Ferrell.
- Yes!

1444
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,173
Get in!

1445
01:01:57,542 --> 01:01:58,542
What's this?

1446
01:02:00,708 --> 01:02:01,708
God.

1447
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:03,875
Check my e-mail.

1448
01:02:15,375 --> 01:02:16,915
Password? Jesus.

1449
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:19,167
Oh, it's "Jesus."

1450
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,130
I always do that.

1451
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:31,542
Oh, my God.

1452
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:34,078
What happened to all my music?

1453
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:38,673
Oh, God!

1454
01:02:52,167 --> 01:02:53,167
What happened?

1455
01:02:55,167 --> 01:02:56,037
Oh..

1456
01:02:56,125 --> 01:02:57,125
God.

1457
01:02:59,333 --> 01:03:00,173
Are you ki...

1458
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:01,830
- How did this happen?
- What the fuck?

1459
01:03:02,667 --> 01:03:03,917
We're fucked.

1460
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:06,708
We're never gonna make it
to Los Angeles now.

1461
01:03:06,792 --> 01:03:07,922
Where are my ferns?

1462
01:03:10,167 --> 01:03:11,167
Where are the fer...

1463
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:13,292
Wait!

1464
01:03:13,417 --> 01:03:14,417
Hey!

1465
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:16,417
You animal!

1466
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:18,750
My ferns!

1467
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:20,625
My ferns!

1468
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:23,665
They're ruined!

1469
01:03:25,625 --> 01:03:27,285
My ferns are ruined!

1470
01:03:27,458 --> 01:03:29,378
Zach, don't worry,
we can get you new ferns.

1471
01:03:29,458 --> 01:03:32,038
What am I thinking?
This is no way to get a talk show.

1472
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:33,962
Driving around the country.

1473
01:03:34,042 --> 01:03:35,582
There's absolutely no way

1474
01:03:35,917 --> 01:03:37,787
we can make it to Los Angeles in time.

1475
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:38,875
It's okay.

1476
01:03:38,917 --> 01:03:41,287
All we have to do
is just walk the nearest town...

1477
01:03:41,375 --> 01:03:42,535
I'm no good for you guys.

1478
01:03:45,417 --> 01:03:46,417
So, get away from me.

1479
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:48,708
<i>It's over. I'm going back home.</i>

1480
01:03:48,792 --> 01:03:50,082
Zach, you can't give up.

1481
01:03:50,583 --> 01:03:51,463
I need you.

1482
01:03:51,542 --> 01:03:53,672
Yeah? Well, I can't do it any more.

1483
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:57,125
So, leave.

1484
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,500
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1485
01:04:02,542 --> 01:04:03,542
We're going?

1486
01:04:08,375 --> 01:04:09,375
Are you sure?

1487
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:36,503
Okay, will you just stop filming, please?

1488
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:38,708
<i>You told me to get everything.</i>

1489
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,382
All right, thank you.
Please just turn the cam...

1490
01:04:44,042 --> 01:04:45,042
Stop!

1491
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,633
What can I get you?

1492
01:05:08,917 --> 01:05:10,327
Can I have an orange juice, please.

1493
01:05:11,125 --> 01:05:13,184
<i>And, as you can see,
Jim is still in the lead,</i>

1494
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:15,458
<i>but we did have to deduct 250 points</i>

1495
01:05:15,542 --> 01:05:18,542
<i>because, during the break,
our judges have ruled that Abraham Lincoln</i>

1496
01:05:18,625 --> 01:05:19,455
There you go.

1497
01:05:19,542 --> 01:05:21,832
<i>...was the 16th President
of the United States.</i>

1498
01:05:22,083 --> 01:05:23,963
<i>Tina, from Houston, Texas.</i>

1499
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:26,168
<i>Texas, represent!</i>

1500
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:29,330
<i>And you said you had a very special reason
for being here on the show tonight?</i>

1501
01:05:29,875 --> 01:05:31,995
<i>It's 'cause I'd love to take
my friends on a vacation.</i>

1502
01:05:32,042 --> 01:05:35,082
<i>They really deserve it
and they mean everything to me.</i>

1503
01:05:36,083 --> 01:05:38,753
<i>And I would love to show them
that I am not a failure,</i>

1504
01:05:39,167 --> 01:05:41,207
<i>and that I just appreciate them.</i>

1505
01:05:41,583 --> 01:05:42,833
<i>So you feel like a failure now?</i>

1506
01:05:43,333 --> 01:05:44,383
<i>Currently, yeah.</i>

1507
01:05:44,458 --> 01:05:47,668
<i>- But you wanna prove that you are not one?
- And I think I can do it today.</i>

1508
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,710
<i>Well, Tina, you are down by quite a bit,</i>

1509
01:05:50,917 --> 01:05:53,417
<i>but you still have a chance
to catch up and win.</i>

1510
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:55,125
<i>That's why we call this show...</i>

1511
01:05:55,208 --> 01:05:58,418
<i>Don't Give Up!</i>

1512
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,500
Don't give up.

1513
01:06:07,875 --> 01:06:08,875
Carol!

1514
01:06:12,208 --> 01:06:13,208
Carol!

1515
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:15,165
- Carol!
- Zach!

1516
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:17,130
- Oh, my God! Zach!
- There you are.

1517
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:21,083
You were right.

1518
01:06:21,292 --> 01:06:22,462
I should never give up.

1519
01:06:22,708 --> 01:06:24,184
I just want to thank you
for believing in me.

1520
01:06:24,208 --> 01:06:26,893
No! Everything's fine, we found a guy
who's gonna take us to Los Angeles.

1521
01:06:26,917 --> 01:06:28,226
- He's gonna drive us.
- Get in the car!

1522
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:29,850
- Yeah?
- Let's go, get in the car!

1523
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:31,535
We're doing it! We're doing it!

1524
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
<i>Thanks, Chuck!</i>

1525
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:49,920
Go, go, go.
Bye! Thank you!

1526
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:52,518
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1527
01:06:54,458 --> 01:06:55,851
What time is it?
Anybody know what time it is?

1528
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:57,825
- No!
- Nobody wears a watch anymore.

1529
01:06:57,917 --> 01:06:58,827
Come on.

1530
01:06:58,917 --> 01:06:59,997
Shit, go.

1531
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,726
- Hey! You can't go in there.
- This way! This way!

1532
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:04,790
Just burst in, just go, go, go!

1533
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Mr. Ferrell?

1534
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:18,790
Mr. Ferrell, it's Zach Galifianakis,

1535
01:07:19,375 --> 01:07:20,745
from the internet show.

1536
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:23,083
I've got those tapes that you wanted.

1537
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:25,333
Hello?

1538
01:07:28,583 --> 01:07:30,213
Jesus Christ!

1539
01:07:30,542 --> 01:07:31,462
What is that?

1540
01:07:31,542 --> 01:07:33,082
- It's a teeth whitener.
- Oh.

1541
01:07:36,875 --> 01:07:37,875
Ah-ah-ah!

1542
01:07:38,792 --> 01:07:41,462
Gently place the bag on the floor
and kick it over to me.

1543
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:43,458
Slowly.

1544
01:07:44,792 --> 01:07:45,792
Slowly.

1545
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:48,750
Gently.

1546
01:07:49,583 --> 01:07:50,583
Gently.

1547
01:07:52,042 --> 01:07:54,212
Now, kick it as hard as you can
across the floor.

1548
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:57,250
Keep kicking them.

1549
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:02,250
That's as hard as you can kick?

1550
01:08:02,333 --> 01:08:03,333
- Do it.
- You can...

1551
01:08:03,417 --> 01:08:05,457
Ah! Fu...

1552
01:08:05,542 --> 01:08:06,672
Push it, if you have to.

1553
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:18,958
They're all there.

1554
01:08:27,375 --> 01:08:28,375
Episode ten.

1555
01:08:30,917 --> 01:08:32,077
Nice job, Zachy Baby.

1556
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:34,726
I knew you were gonna say
something like that. I told you right?

1557
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:36,851
- Yeah, you did.
- I said "Zachy Baby," and he said it.

1558
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:38,575
You completed your task.

1559
01:08:40,125 --> 01:08:41,125
And now...

1560
01:08:42,625 --> 01:08:43,625
you may leave.

1561
01:08:45,583 --> 01:08:47,923
You told me that
if I delivered those tapes,

1562
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,768
you'd give me my own network talk show.

1563
01:08:51,625 --> 01:08:53,165
<i>Our</i> own talk show.

1564
01:08:53,542 --> 01:08:56,082
Are you forgetting the "pro"
of the quid pro quo?

1565
01:08:56,167 --> 01:08:59,077
I asked you to deliver
ten episodes of your show...

1566
01:08:59,167 --> 01:09:00,707
- Yeah.
- ...by 9:00 a.m.

1567
01:09:01,083 --> 01:09:02,883
Yeah, it's 9:00 a.m.
It's before 9:00 a.m.

1568
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:04,250
9:00 a.m...

1569
01:09:05,458 --> 01:09:06,668
Tokyo time!

1570
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:09,210
Before the markets open!

1571
01:09:09,875 --> 01:09:11,825
I can't do anything with these!

1572
01:09:12,083 --> 01:09:13,833
They are worthless to me,

1573
01:09:13,917 --> 01:09:15,327
you fat idiot!

1574
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:19,268
- How could we have known?
- There's no way...

1575
01:09:19,292 --> 01:09:20,922
It makes sense, though. Let's just go.

1576
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,480
Let's just get out of here. I'm so...

1577
01:09:22,583 --> 01:09:23,753
Mr. Galifianakis?

1578
01:09:23,917 --> 01:09:24,747
Yes?

1579
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:26,213
Your television contract.

1580
01:09:28,417 --> 01:09:30,917
For one big, fancy network talk show.

1581
01:09:37,458 --> 01:09:38,858
What is this? What... what is this?

1582
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,920
I was fucking with you!

1583
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,420
- What, you mean...
- You know why I was fucking with you?

1584
01:09:44,042 --> 01:09:46,382
Because that's what celebrities
do to each other.

1585
01:09:47,542 --> 01:09:48,922
You were just Clooney-ed.

1586
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
What?

1587
01:09:50,083 --> 01:09:50,963
You won.

1588
01:09:51,042 --> 01:09:52,962
I'm getting my own network talk show?

1589
01:09:53,042 --> 01:09:54,882
You're about to be a TV star!

1590
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:57,168
God Almighty!

1591
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:59,330
- Yeah!
- On TV, not the internet?

1592
01:09:59,417 --> 01:10:01,037
My God! Zach!

1593
01:10:01,125 --> 01:10:02,825
- Yeah!
- You did it!

1594
01:10:02,917 --> 01:10:03,917
So exciting.

1595
01:10:10,208 --> 01:10:11,458
My two ferns...

1596
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,582
you know, they were destroyed and...

1597
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:18,168
I don't know if I can
do a show without them.

1598
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:20,080
You sign that contract...

1599
01:10:21,292 --> 01:10:22,382
and I'll give you something

1600
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:24,325
way better than two ferns.

1601
01:10:25,208 --> 01:10:26,208
Three ferns?

1602
01:10:28,333 --> 01:10:30,543
- Twenty?
- No, four ferns

1603
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:31,625
Four fer...

1604
01:10:32,083 --> 01:10:33,793
- Four ferns?
- Four ferns!

1605
01:10:36,042 --> 01:10:37,672
Gaya! Come on!

1606
01:10:39,292 --> 01:10:42,172
USA! USA!

1607
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:43,250
US...

1608
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:56,632
Hi, welcome back, I'm Zachy G,

1609
01:10:56,708 --> 01:10:59,128
and you're watching
my first episode of...

1610
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,583
<i>Ferns.</i>

1611
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,710
Give it up for DJ Flop!

1612
01:11:08,167 --> 01:11:09,667
What's going on, Zachy G?

1613
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:12,458
Okay,

1614
01:11:12,708 --> 01:11:15,038
let's get to our very first guest ever.

1615
01:11:15,583 --> 01:11:16,833
According to Wikipedia,

1616
01:11:16,917 --> 01:11:18,667
she is 5 ft. 10,

1617
01:11:18,792 --> 01:11:21,132
and was born April 30th, 1985.

1618
01:11:21,417 --> 01:11:24,127
Please welcome our guest, Gal Gadot!

1619
01:11:24,583 --> 01:11:25,673
Oh, Gal!

1620
01:11:28,333 --> 01:11:30,253
- Hey! How are you?
- Hi.

1621
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:31,333
Ooh.

1622
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,375
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1623
01:11:34,417 --> 01:11:35,827
Thank you so much for having me.

1624
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:36,957
Hey, everyone.

1625
01:11:38,125 --> 01:11:38,955
Ah.

1626
01:11:39,042 --> 01:11:41,002
Oh, how wonderful is this?

1627
01:11:41,083 --> 01:11:42,673
Gal Gadot's here!

1628
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:45,250
Thank you so much for having me,

1629
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:49,173
and I'm so honored
to be the first guest on your first show.

1630
01:11:49,708 --> 01:11:51,878
I've never been someone's first before,
so that's...

1631
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:55,378
All right, so, uh, Gal,

1632
01:11:55,583 --> 01:11:57,713
here comes my first question.

1633
01:11:58,917 --> 01:12:01,287
Now, Gal, you played Wonder Woman.

1634
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:02,827
I'm wondering, woman,

1635
01:12:02,958 --> 01:12:03,958
how fun was that?

1636
01:12:06,542 --> 01:12:09,672
It was amazing, it was so much fun.

1637
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,040
The ratings are solid
in all four quadrants.

1638
01:12:41,125 --> 01:12:42,665
A slight dip in seniors over 80,

1639
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:44,510
but you make up for it
with pregnant mothers,

1640
01:12:44,542 --> 01:12:46,382
which technically
counts as watching for two.

1641
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:47,995
Oh, hey, guys.

1642
01:12:48,083 --> 01:12:49,463
Can I have a minute with them?

1643
01:12:49,542 --> 01:12:50,542
Sure.

1644
01:12:52,708 --> 01:12:53,578
You saw that, huh?

1645
01:12:53,667 --> 01:12:54,667
- Yeah, we did.
- Yeah.

1646
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:55,788
What was that all about?

1647
01:12:55,875 --> 01:12:57,285
I thought it was so good!

1648
01:12:57,583 --> 01:12:59,753
I mean, did you see the chemistry
between me and Gal?

1649
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,422
It was unbelievable,

1650
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,290
the back-and-forth we had.

1651
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:04,768
I don't think that's what Carol meant.

1652
01:13:04,792 --> 01:13:06,922
Yeah, it's different
from what you usually do.

1653
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,130
Okay, yeah, all right, so,

1654
01:13:08,208 --> 01:13:10,708
Mr. Ferrell and I talked about the old me,

1655
01:13:11,333 --> 01:13:14,293
and the old me
is not gonna work for this, you guys.

1656
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,880
This is the new me, this is the new ZG.

1657
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:18,628
Celebrities don't wanna be insulted,

1658
01:13:18,708 --> 01:13:20,788
they just wanna talk
about their fascinating lives.

1659
01:13:20,917 --> 01:13:22,747
But, don't you kind of feel
like a sell-out?

1660
01:13:22,833 --> 01:13:24,153
Can you really call it a sell-out

1661
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:26,208
when they give you a free Tesla
for doing the show?

1662
01:13:26,292 --> 01:13:28,422
That's literally
the definition of selling out.

1663
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,500
Zach, do you really
wanna be like Will Ferrell?

1664
01:13:30,583 --> 01:13:31,923
Some washed-up has-been

1665
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,210
who takes cameos in Hollywood movies

1666
01:13:34,292 --> 01:13:36,172
just to get another day's worth
of cocaine?

1667
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:39,670
You know, I didn't even like you
before we took this trip to Hollywood,

1668
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:42,420
but at least then I knew who you were.

1669
01:13:42,625 --> 01:13:45,325
I don't know who this person is
that you're pretending to be.

1670
01:13:46,833 --> 01:13:48,463
So, are you just saying that I should...

1671
01:13:49,708 --> 01:13:51,078
just forget everything? Just...

1672
01:13:52,458 --> 01:13:54,668
just drop my dreams, my childhood dreams?

1673
01:13:56,667 --> 01:13:59,377
Zach, we need you on set
to shoot promos for tomorrow's show.

1674
01:14:00,708 --> 01:14:03,378
Zach, we're leaving. We're going
to drive back to North Carolina.

1675
01:14:03,458 --> 01:14:05,878
Shirl called and said
they rebuilt the studio.

1676
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:07,625
We can have our old jobs back.

1677
01:14:08,417 --> 01:14:10,497
Carol, you're the one
that told me never to give up.

1678
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,790
I know, and I still believe in you, Zach,
but...

1679
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:16,205
this isn't you.

1680
01:14:17,458 --> 01:14:19,248
Zach? Are you coming?

1681
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Hey, guys!

1682
01:14:50,417 --> 01:14:51,877
Wait for me! I had to get my ferns.

1683
01:14:51,958 --> 01:14:52,828
- Zach!
- What?

1684
01:14:52,917 --> 01:14:54,997
We thought you chose the show over us?

1685
01:14:55,167 --> 01:14:57,167
What, just 'cause I walked
into the studio silently

1686
01:14:57,208 --> 01:14:58,748
without telling you what I was doing?

1687
01:14:58,833 --> 01:14:59,833
Have more faith.

1688
01:14:59,917 --> 01:15:01,287
Of course I'm going with you guys!

1689
01:15:01,375 --> 01:15:02,745
- You're coming?
- Yes!

1690
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:04,293
- You're coming with us?
- Yes!

1691
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:06,575
All right! Let's go. Let's go.

1692
01:15:06,667 --> 01:15:07,667
Yes!

1693
01:15:08,542 --> 01:15:09,832
Carol, you were right.

1694
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:11,833
Hollywood's not for us.

1695
01:15:12,625 --> 01:15:15,165
It has a need to sanitize everything,

1696
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:17,380
to slap a happy ending on everything.

1697
01:15:17,458 --> 01:15:19,168
So, let's get out of here

1698
01:15:19,583 --> 01:15:21,543
and drive off into the sunset together.

1699
01:15:22,625 --> 01:15:24,245
'Cause all I need are my friends,

1700
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:25,750
my show,

1701
01:15:26,208 --> 01:15:27,208
and my ferns.

1702
01:15:33,708 --> 01:15:34,918
We'll just get some new ones.

1703
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,710
- I'll drive.
- Okay.

1704
01:15:43,875 --> 01:15:45,785
Bradley Co... Bradley Coper.

1705
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:47,893
- Cooper. Yeah.
- Bradly Cooper co-wrote,

1706
01:15:47,917 --> 01:15:50,207
produced, directed
and starred in <i>A Star Is Born.</i>

1707
01:15:50,292 --> 01:15:51,132
I haven't seen it.

1708
01:15:51,208 --> 01:15:54,078
Are you hoping that will open doors
for other hot idiots?

1709
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,330
It's such a good question!

1710
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:03,673
So sorry.

1711
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:05,332
- Oh...
- I'm so sorry.

1712
01:16:05,417 --> 01:16:06,627
Let's take that one back.

1713
01:16:06,708 --> 01:16:09,378
And, uh, we had this young woman,

1714
01:16:09,542 --> 01:16:11,422
heroic young woman, Malala...

1715
01:16:12,292 --> 01:16:13,672
uh, on the show,

1716
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:15,330
and, um...

1717
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:18,670
Known the world over,
not big in North America.

1718
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,630
You, I can tell by that look

1719
01:16:20,708 --> 01:16:22,428
that you have no idea
who I'm talking about.

1720
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,340
- Yeah, I know who you're talking about.
- Who?

1721
01:16:24,458 --> 01:16:25,958
Adam Carolla, is that who you said?

1722
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,080
That's why I have this look on my face.

1723
01:16:33,333 --> 01:16:34,173
Wow.

1724
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:35,410
If you didn't have an accent,

1725
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:38,458
do you think people would be able
to tell that you're not a very good actor?

1726
01:16:44,542 --> 01:16:45,542
Please keep going.

1727
01:16:46,083 --> 01:16:48,083
I read online that you're very private

1728
01:16:48,167 --> 01:16:50,747
and decline to answer questions
that make you feel uncomfortable.

1729
01:16:50,833 --> 01:16:52,043
This is a two-parter.

1730
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:55,500
Is that true? And how old were you
when you got your period?

1731
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,880
Do you ever go to the DMZ?

1732
01:17:00,708 --> 01:17:03,378
- No.
- It's a combination of TMZ and the DMV.

1733
01:17:03,458 --> 01:17:05,418
That's just a bunch of people...

1734
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:06,920
sitting around...

1735
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:11,705
talking about their drivers' licenses.

1736
01:17:14,167 --> 01:17:16,287
Talking about celebrity drivers' licenses.

1737
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:20,000
"Oh, my gosh,
she's got a C-class on hers."

1738
01:17:21,333 --> 01:17:22,333
"Oh...

1739
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:25,328
James Franco wears corrective lenses."

1740
01:17:31,083 --> 01:17:33,133
- You used to live in your car.
- Yeah.

1741
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:35,290
Is it as fun as it sounds,
or is there a downside?

1742
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,210
Would you say that your work
in <i>La La Land</i>

1743
01:17:44,542 --> 01:17:45,752
really helped pave the way

1744
01:17:45,833 --> 01:17:48,213
for white people
to explain jazz to black people?

1745
01:17:48,292 --> 01:17:49,292
Sorry!

1746
01:17:53,958 --> 01:17:55,838
All right. Let me get that out.
Sorry, you guys.

1747
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:57,915
We'll be right back
with <i>Who Gives A Shit?</i>

1748
01:18:01,917 --> 01:18:04,377
I mean, what, did you
read something last night

1749
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:06,748
and were so eager to come
tell a bunch of young people

1750
01:18:06,833 --> 01:18:08,133
about what you read?

1751
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:10,880
Yes, I did.

1752
01:18:11,708 --> 01:18:12,918
I did do a lot of reading.

1753
01:18:13,042 --> 01:18:15,962
When you and Woody Harrelson
are acting in a scene together,

1754
01:18:16,042 --> 01:18:19,082
are you sad that somewhere
there's a sack not being hackied?

1755
01:18:24,292 --> 01:18:25,292
That's good.

1756
01:18:25,458 --> 01:18:27,038
"A sack not being hackied."

1757
01:18:27,542 --> 01:18:30,002
What was the marijuana budget
on <i>True Detective?</i>

1758
01:18:34,208 --> 01:18:35,208
And are you...

1759
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:37,013
Have you smoked
a lot of that budget today?

1760
01:18:38,542 --> 01:18:39,542
Oh, shit.

1761
01:18:39,625 --> 01:18:41,455
- You know a guy that has a Tesla?
- Mm-hmm.

1762
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,580
I won the EGOF.

1763
01:18:45,708 --> 01:18:46,538
Hmm?

1764
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:47,955
- You know what an EGOT is?
- No.

1765
01:18:48,083 --> 01:18:50,253
Oh, an EGOT! Stupid!

1766
01:18:50,875 --> 01:18:52,665
It's amazing that this is even a thing.

1767
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
An EGOT?

1768
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:54,882
Or this thing?

1769
01:18:54,958 --> 01:18:55,998
This.

1770
01:18:56,083 --> 01:18:58,543
I wasn't talking about the EGOT!
I really...

1771
01:19:00,417 --> 01:19:02,787
I was talking about this. Exactly.

1772
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:07,038
There's a kid on the Disney Channel.

1773
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,080
Uh, Chad...

1774
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:10,330
Farthouse.

1775
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:12,667
He's on one of...
<i>Wizards Of Waverly Place.</i>

1776
01:19:17,542 --> 01:19:19,101
- Your face...
- How does anybody do this?

1777
01:19:19,125 --> 01:19:20,125
- Sorry.
- Your face.

1778
01:19:20,167 --> 01:19:21,377
- Sorry.
- ...is not helping.

1779
01:19:21,458 --> 01:19:23,038
Chad Far...

1780
01:19:24,458 --> 01:19:25,458
Do you hear that?

1781
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:26,955
No, I don't hear anything.

1782
01:19:27,208 --> 01:19:28,708
That is the sound of everybody

1783
01:19:28,792 --> 01:19:31,212
talking about your performance
in <i>Big Little Lies.</i>

1784
01:19:32,917 --> 01:19:33,957
No one cares.

1785
01:19:36,583 --> 01:19:37,583
It's so mean!

1786
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,300
Your parents got divorced
when you were seven.

1787
01:19:42,208 --> 01:19:43,208
Was that your fault?

1788
01:19:45,833 --> 01:19:46,673
And guess why?

1789
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:50,210
They named their daughter
after a fucking piece of cheese.

1790
01:19:53,125 --> 01:19:55,825
Again, I'd like to thank
crystal meth Santa Claus for being here.

1791
01:20:00,458 --> 01:20:03,168
Don Draper's suit
hangs in the Smithsonian Museum

1792
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:04,309
- Yes, it does.
- It's an honor.

1793
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:06,333
- Yeah!
- Right next to the Cosby sweaters?

1794
01:20:17,708 --> 01:20:19,168
- Okay.
- No!

1795
01:20:19,375 --> 01:20:21,075
What advice would you
give to a young actor

1796
01:20:21,167 --> 01:20:23,457
who wants to hide his Jewishness
as well as you have?

1797
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,880
You know what happens
when a Jewish guy

1798
01:20:36,333 --> 01:20:39,253
walks into a brick wall
with a full erection?

1799
01:20:40,667 --> 01:20:42,167
- What?
- He breaks his nose.

1800
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:45,633
I knew that was the answer!

1801
01:20:46,958 --> 01:20:48,538
I did too, and I laughed!

1802
01:20:48,625 --> 01:20:51,345
- I've told that joke for 20...
- Did you just come up with the joke?

1803
01:20:51,708 --> 01:20:53,248
That's a joke you've told before?

1804
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:03,625
And...

1805
01:21:04,083 --> 01:21:05,543
that's the end of your movie, right?

1806
01:21:05,958 --> 01:21:07,248
Yeah. And cut.

1807
01:21:07,708 --> 01:21:10,328
Thanks, guys, thank you very much
for your time. Thank you.

1808
01:21:10,458 --> 01:21:12,328
Thank you so much for doing this. Uh...

1809
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:15,168
I think it's gonna be good.
I hope my professor gives me an A.

1810
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:16,250
What?

1811
01:21:17,292 --> 01:21:18,972
Your professor?
What are you talking about?

1812
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,630
Yeah, this is a student film.

1813
01:21:20,875 --> 01:21:22,675
I'm a student
at Appalachian State University.

1814
01:21:22,875 --> 01:21:23,955
Student film?

1815
01:21:24,292 --> 01:21:25,882
Yeah, I told you that at the beginning.

1816
01:21:25,958 --> 01:21:27,498
So, nobody's gonna see this?

1817
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,460
Well, my professor's gonna see it.

1818
01:21:29,667 --> 01:21:30,667
And the students.

1819
01:21:31,083 --> 01:21:32,309
There's, like, 12 people in my class.

1820
01:21:32,333 --> 01:21:33,543
And I'll show my parents.

1821
01:21:35,083 --> 01:21:36,603
Get the fuck out of my office, please.

1822
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:38,330
Excuse me?

1823
01:21:38,417 --> 01:21:40,327
Get the fudge out of my office, please.

1824
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:43,768
I said "fuck" the first time, now I'm
saying "fudge" 'cause it's more polite,

1825
01:21:43,792 --> 01:21:45,252
but get the fuck out of my office.

1826
01:21:45,458 --> 01:21:47,128
Geez. Sorry.

1827
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:58,080
It could've been in 3D!

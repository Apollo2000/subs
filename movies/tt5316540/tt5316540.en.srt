1
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,878
<i>Sam? Just received a report...</i>

2
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,793
<i>...attacked a village
near your location. Over.</i>

3
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:12,963
Go ahead.

4
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:15,462
<i>Satellite shows... heading south.</i>

5
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:19,042
<i>Expect fleeing villagers traveling on foot
towards your location...</i>

6
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:31,997
<i>Sam...</i>

7
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,833
<i>Sam, do you copy? Over.</i>

8
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,785
Wait out! Turn around! Go!

9
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,420
Zero, this is four. Contact.

10
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,787
Wait out. Hostile! Reverse!

11
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:06,502
Golf alpha, requesting immediate evac.

12
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,213
We are under attack.
I repeat, immediate evac.

13
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:12,422
<i>- Copy that. Send location.</i>
<i>- </i>Location six-seven.

14
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,418
Get in the back. Move!

15
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,130
Move over. Fast!

16
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,630
- Scream.
- Oh, my God.

17
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,038
I... I can't.

18
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,460
Help me! Please don't shoot me!

19
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,330
Stop the vehicle! Stop!

20
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,708
Get out of the car.
Get out of the fucking car. Get out!

21
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:46,422
Move! Move! Move!

22
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,920
Keep moving.

23
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,500
Get down on your knees.
Get down! Get down!

24
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,253
Sarah, Joe! Get out of the car.

25
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,670
Get out! Move!

26
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,210
Move! Faster! Move! Move!

27
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,828
Move!

28
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:07,582
You need to get ready, Zoe.

29
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,710
We gather here today

30
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:35,502
to celebrate the life of Eric Tanner.

31
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:39,253
Who leaves behind his only daughter,
Zoe.

32
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:44,503
She has had more tragedy to bear
than most at her young age.

33
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,643
Eric was responsible

34
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:48,997
for the lives of many...

35
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:53,535
both with his business...
and extensive charity work.

36
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,880
He also leaves behind his wife, Rima,

37
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:01,125
with whom he shared ten wonderful years.

38
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,460
I know you will join with me
in supporting them both at this time.

39
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:30,995
<i>Friday, 5:58 p.m.</i>

40
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:35,538
<i>Hello, my name is Derek Litman.
I'm with Allstate Farmers Life Insurance.</i>

41
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,325
<i>Uh, the reason I'm calling today
is that we are offering...</i>

42
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:41,577
<i>Hey, Sam. Justin.</i>

43
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,208
<i>That drink. Give me a call.</i>

44
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,580
<i>Hi, um...</i>

45
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:52,462
<i>I don't... I don't know if this is the...</i>

46
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,958
<i>Los Angeles, where any rain
is considered a newsworthy novelty,</i>

47
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:17,542
<i>is caught in a genuine tropical downpour.
It's currently 75 degrees.</i>

48
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,415
<i>Shareholders in Hassine Mining,</i>

49
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,920
<i>concerned by the death
of CFO Eric Tanner,</i>

50
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,210
<i>were reassured by a billion-dollar deal</i>

51
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:27,132
<i>secured by his stand-in and widow,
Rima Hassine.</i>

52
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,633
<i>Phosphate mining is known
as the white gold of Africa,</i>

53
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,878
<i>a global industry fought over
between giants Sikong</i>

54
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,498
<i>and rival, Hassine Mining.</i>

55
00:10:36,417 --> 00:10:38,827
<i>- Shares of Hassine Mining...</i>
- How did this leak?

56
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,828
Look at the stock. It's stable.

57
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,423
The deal's not done until it's signed.

58
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,630
This will provide confidence
at a key time for us.

59
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:50,327
It shows you have not been weakened
by Eric's death.

60
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:56,035
Let the story run. Follow my advice.

61
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,745
Bring my flight forward
to tomorrow morning.

62
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,673
<i>...is worth over three billion dollars.</i>

63
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:07,627
What do you want?

64
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,750
Hi.

65
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:19,247
How are you feeling?

66
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:21,917
Pretty shitty.

67
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,915
I know. Me, too.

68
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:29,917
Where's Adam?

69
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:32,963
Oh, you don't know?

70
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,625
What?

71
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:38,037
He requested a transfer.

72
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,415
Zoe, the lawyers are waiting.

73
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,383
Will you be all right?

74
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,708
You're not gonna start pretending
you care about me?

75
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:49,875
Oh, Zoe...

76
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:51,998
Make yourself presentable.

77
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,535
"I, Eric Tanner,

78
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,165
hereby bequeath all my shares
in Hassine Mining...

79
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,790
to Zoe Tanner."

80
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,328
I will contest this.

81
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:13,787
Eric wanted me
to present this to you personally.

82
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,955
He felt you might need our... guidance.

83
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:18,962
I can't believe he did this.

84
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,268
There are some terms I need to run through
before we conclude this meeting.

85
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:24,212
My family founded Hassine Mining.

86
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,455
How much are they worth?

87
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:28,382
The shares?

88
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:32,167
Eric hoped that getting Zoe involved
in the company...

89
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,290
would bring you closer.

90
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,248
I don't have time for this.

91
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:41,502
We anticipate it'll take three months
for the share transfer to go through.

92
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,293
- So I can stay here for the summer?
- No, I need you with me.

93
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,785
No. I hate it there.

94
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,825
We can meet there
and discuss matters then.

95
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:49,577
Ladies, look...

96
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,535
Miss Tanner?

97
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,330
We need to assign you
a new close protection officer.

98
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:57,997
Well, seeing as she's coming
to the Azref residence next week,

99
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,543
I'm assuming one of my team
can take it from there.

100
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,250
Yeah, that will be fine.

101
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:04,252
Find someone she can't fuck.

102
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,785
Let's go.

103
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:06,745
You coping?

104
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,288
With what exactly?

105
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,710
Work. Being based in an office.

106
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,080
Must be hard.

107
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,418
Looks cute.

108
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,630
You still get off on dodging bullets?

109
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:29,457
I had shitty intel.

110
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:34,707
- You could do with a rest.
- That's none of your concern.

111
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:55,882
So Rima Hassine was his second wife.

112
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,325
Her real mother died when Zoe was ten.

113
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,083
Suicide.

114
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,250
Great.

115
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:05,542
A rich kid with mommy issues.

116
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:28,768
- Alik.
- Pleasure to meet you.

117
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:31,672
You, too.
Sam, this is Hassine's head of security.

118
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:33,252
Nice to meet you.

119
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:35,726
I advised the family not to work
with your company again,

120
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,330
but Madame Hassine wanted a woman.

121
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:41,422
Happy to be of assistance.

122
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:45,003
We don't have female CPOs in Morocco.

123
00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:55,212
Mr. Sinclair and Ms. Carlson.

124
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,748
Am I supposed to know who you are?

125
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,535
Ms. Carlson is Adam's replacement.

126
00:18:02,292 --> 00:18:04,042
Sam. Nice to meet you.

127
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,668
Take him to the kitchen.
He needs to be fed.

128
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,745
We leave in an hour.

129
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,670
You might want to change.

130
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,830
So they... hired me
because Adam was fucking her.

131
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,563
Look at it this way.
They actually want a woman. It's progress.

132
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,130
Who do you think you are? My mom?

133
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:36,247
Of course not.

134
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:41,667
- I could have you fired.
- Be my guest.

135
00:19:43,292 --> 00:19:45,382
I don't care
what you think about me.

136
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,495
I don't think anything about you.

137
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,883
I'll wait outside.

138
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:23,580
<i>Our helicopter today
is 20 miles north. That's 1,500...</i>

139
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,705
Have you been briefed
on the risk factors here?

140
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,708
- Many times.
- Including kidnap for ransom?

141
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:38,382
Look, they pretty much lock me away here.

142
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:43,752
What happened to your face?

143
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,042
Sorry?

144
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:48,212
What happened to your face?

145
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,208
Work.

146
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,375
My inheritance.

147
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,673
You should know there's been
a recent increase

148
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,460
in high-net worth individuals
being targeted for kidnap and ransom.

149
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:23,707
You're great company.
I'm really gonna miss you.

150
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:27,377
Hassine Mining has
a very suitable replacement.

151
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:30,172
Someone who knows the region better.

152
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:44,632
You know what a "kasbah" means?

153
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,583
No.

154
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:48,752
Fortified house.

155
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,960
<i>Prepare to land on helipad.</i>

156
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,998
Welcome to my prison.

157
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,208
Zoe.

158
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:52,708
Where's Rima?

159
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,708
She'll be a few days.
She's held up in the mines.

160
00:22:58,292 --> 00:22:59,962
We have a car on standby for you.

161
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:02,922
No. She's staying for the night.

162
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:07,043
Her contract is over.
She's heading to the airport.

163
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,495
Her flight isn't till tomorrow morning.

164
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:12,288
She still has 12 hours on the clock.

165
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,210
You've been paid for it.

166
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:16,917
Fine.

167
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:03,542
Fuck.

168
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:28,455
Tactical defenses active, sir.

169
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:30,497
Get that camera back online.

170
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:37,537
Can I help you?

171
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:39,785
Was he like that when I took a shower?

172
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:45,077
Abdel, take a break.

173
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:50,252
There aren't as many boots on the ground
as I expected.

174
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:53,173
This is a top-of-the-range safe house.

175
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:55,705
It supersedes the need for manpower.

176
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:57,753
You can relax.

177
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,580
Just wanted to see your setup.

178
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:21,502
You like what you see?

179
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,670
My sexual preferences aren't women.

180
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:27,458
Good night, Zoe.

181
00:27:57,333 --> 00:28:00,383
<i>Hi, it's... it's Beth.</i>

182
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:04,125
<i>Um, I'm not sure
if this is the right number.</i>

183
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:05,458
<i>Um...</i>

184
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:29,518
Get down! Get down!

185
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:35,537
What's in the walls?

186
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:36,995
Shells.

187
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:38,375
What the fuck?

188
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:43,208
Go to Alik.

189
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,630
Get access to the control room.

190
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:48,575
Someone has taken over the system.
I'll go to Zoe.

191
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:13,958
Open the door.

192
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,330
<i>Be advised, hostile on exterior roof.</i>

193
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:17,417
Copy.

194
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,455
Approaching target.

195
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,553
<i>Her door
is encrypted. Give me two minutes.</i>

196
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:02,583
Copy.

197
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:05,958
In position.

198
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:11,245
Sam... Sam to Alik. Sam to Alik.
Do you copy?

199
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:13,285
I need backup.

200
00:32:15,792 --> 00:32:18,212
Zoe? Zoe, it's Sam. I'm outside.

201
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:21,463
Sam! Sam, what do I do?

202
00:32:21,542 --> 00:32:23,752
There are intruders.
If they're coming for you,

203
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:25,923
they have to open the shutters
to get in to you.

204
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:27,705
That will be your chance.

205
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:30,422
I want you to get down low,
so you can roll out to me.

206
00:32:31,292 --> 00:32:33,502
Alik? Alik, do you copy?

207
00:32:35,167 --> 00:32:38,627
<i>I need backup.
I repeat, backup is needed on terrace C.</i>

208
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:40,628
<i>Backup is needed...</i>

209
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:46,917
Zoe, I need you to get ready.

210
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:48,828
Sam, there won't be enough time.

211
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:52,577
There is enough time,
so get down low, stay low, okay?

212
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:55,457
As soon as the shutters open,
you roll out to me.

213
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,790
<i>One minute.</i>

214
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:05,333
Sam!

215
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:07,247
I'm right here. I need you to stay calm.

216
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:24,745
Sam! Sam!

217
00:33:26,792 --> 00:33:28,542
Mark in position. Open it up.

218
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:34,127
Sam, the door's opening!
This is not opening! Sam!

219
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,038
They will open. Just stay low.

220
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:39,035
Okay.

221
00:33:39,792 --> 00:33:41,422
- Push!
- Sam!

222
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,960
- Stay low!
- They're coming! Sam, they're coming!

223
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:50,165
Come on. Come on!

224
00:33:52,042 --> 00:33:53,212
Where's the girl?

225
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:55,042
- Fuck!
- This way.

226
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:01,488
- Come on!
- My feet!

227
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:03,582
We're nearly... We're nearly there.

228
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,250
Thank God you were there.

229
00:35:29,583 --> 00:35:30,633
No phone, please.

230
00:35:44,583 --> 00:35:45,923
Where are you taking us?

231
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:48,292
Police headquarter, madam.

232
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,710
How much longer?

233
00:35:57,292 --> 00:35:58,882
English not good. Sorry.

234
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:08,463
- Sam.
- Do you understand what they're saying?

235
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:10,752
It's an address.
It's not the police station.

236
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:12,877
And they're talking about money.

237
00:36:57,792 --> 00:36:59,042
Sam!

238
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:08,577
Sam!

239
00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:28,165
Come on! Just come on!

240
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:55,667
Hey.

241
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:14,832
No passports. We got mugged.

242
00:39:03,042 --> 00:39:04,712
We can't stay here.

243
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:08,038
I can't do this!

244
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,580
You shot a cop.

245
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,458
You made yourself a fugitive.

246
00:39:14,542 --> 00:39:16,832
He... He was gonna kill you.

247
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,380
There was a reason I didn't use my gun.

248
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,417
What is he saying?

249
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,828
What is he saying?
Zoe, what is he saying?

250
00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:40,667
Calm down.

251
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,210
You need to calm down.

252
00:39:42,292 --> 00:39:46,712
I... I... I...

253
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,040
Calm down. Calm down. Look at me.

254
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:52,125
Shh! Shh!

255
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:54,583
Shh! Shh!

256
00:39:54,667 --> 00:39:57,667
Okay? No. Look at me. Look at me.

257
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,330
Calm... Shh!

258
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:00,457
Look at me.

259
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,380
Good. Good. Okay. Shh!

260
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:05,418
You're gonna... You're going to call Rima.

261
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,880
She's gonna get you out.

262
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:11,038
Okay? Okay?

263
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:13,955
Good. Good.

264
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:23,327
<i>Hassine Mining heiress, Zoe Tanner,</i>

265
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:27,077
<i>who is set to inherit the entirety
of her late father's shares,</i>

266
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:31,377
<i>is wanted for questioning over the death
of a local policeman in Casablanca.</i>

267
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:34,828
<i>Hassine's stocks are already dropping
when they were forecast to increase</i>

268
00:40:34,917 --> 00:40:37,247
<i>in the run-up
to the signature of the deal.</i>

269
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:40,833
<i>Madame Hassine will be joining us
on our business segment tomorrow.</i>

270
00:40:40,917 --> 00:40:42,417
Get Alik on the phone.

271
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:46,833
Uh...

272
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:50,037
He didn't make it.

273
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:53,827
Who's left?

274
00:40:53,917 --> 00:40:56,667
Three or four men.
They are not contactable.

275
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:58,748
We believe they may have taken bribes.

276
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:02,917
Hello?

277
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:07,707
Who is this?

278
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:11,288
It's me.

279
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:14,383
<i>I need your help.</i>

280
00:41:14,792 --> 00:41:16,832
Zoe, this is a huge mess.

281
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,630
I'm in real trouble.

282
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:22,628
Did you really kill that policeman?

283
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,040
Yes.

284
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:31,883
Were you high?

285
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:35,125
No. No, of course not.
We were attacked.

286
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:38,288
<i>Zoe, it's all over the news.
Our stocks are plummeting.</i>

287
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:40,165
Are you serious right now?

288
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,455
Someone tried to kill me,

289
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:43,712
and you're worried
about your fucking shares?

290
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:46,583
You know,
if your security hadn't been so shit,

291
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:48,287
<i>I wouldn't be in this mess.</i>

292
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:50,708
Alik died trying to protect you.

293
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:52,252
That was his job!

294
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:56,125
Zoe, that's enough, please.

295
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:58,128
You don't even care about me!

296
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:00,125
You never wanted me!

297
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:03,434
You know, it's a good thing
you never could have kids,

298
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:05,668
because I wouldn't wish you on anybody!

299
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:14,793
Who else is there?

300
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:18,875
No one.

301
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,460
Your insurance policy dictates
you send in a team.

302
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:30,673
I'm taking Zoe off the policy.

303
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:33,713
Effective immediately.

304
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:52,673
You're leaving.

305
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,540
I'm going out
to get us some supplies.

306
00:42:57,833 --> 00:42:59,333
You won't come back.

307
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,630
I'm gonna get you out of the country.

308
00:43:10,292 --> 00:43:12,132
You're not leaving me here?

309
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:14,503
Let's get one thing straight.

310
00:43:15,083 --> 00:43:17,633
I no longer work for you
or the Hassines.

311
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:21,535
So from now on,
you do as I say. Okay?

312
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:27,423
Stay here.

313
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:33,462
And don't open for anyone.

314
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,630
<i>Good evening.</i>

315
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:42,288
<i>Tonight, we will be talking
to Hassine Mining CEO Rima Hassine,</i>

316
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:46,035
<i>and Watt Li,
the deputy CEO of Sikong Industries.</i>

317
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,500
<i>Bids were placed by both companies</i>

318
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:51,923
<i>to purchase over 6,000 hectares
of land in Zambia,</i>

319
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,210
<i>speculated to have
the world's largest phosphate reserves.</i>

320
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:58,252
<i>A dramatic fall in share prices
at Hassine Mining</i>

321
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:01,793
<i>has led to speculation Sikong
could steal the deal from under them.</i>

322
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:04,375
<i>The deadline for closing is tomorrow.</i>

323
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:08,875
<i>Madame Hassine,
it's been a difficult few weeks for you.</i>

324
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:11,878
<i>Is there anything you can say
to your shareholders</i>

325
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:13,248
<i>that might reassure them?</i>

326
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,210
<i>Hassine Mining is doing everything
in its power</i>

327
00:45:16,292 --> 00:45:18,882
<i>to cooperate
with the ongoing police investigation.</i>

328
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:23,418
<i>I, personally, have had no contact
with Zoe, with... with Miss Tanner,</i>

329
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:27,380
<i>and my message to her would be
to hand herself over to the authorities</i>

330
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,498
<i>as quickly as possible.</i>

331
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:33,498
<i>Hassine Mining is having
one of its strongest years yet</i>

332
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:37,963
<i>and is confident in completing
the Zambian phosphate deal tomorrow.</i>

333
00:45:38,542 --> 00:45:42,922
<i>Well, surely a governmental organization,
such as the Izwe Estate Group,</i>

334
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,330
<i>they must have a code of ethics
they need to abide by.</i>

335
00:45:46,417 --> 00:45:49,787
<i>Uh, how can they justify proceeding
with Hassine Mining</i>

336
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:51,495
<i>when you're under police investigation?</i>

337
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:55,463
<i>Zoe Tanner is not a...
is... is not an employee of Hassine Mining.</i>

338
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:59,078
<i>Has she not just inherited
a large proportion of the company?</i>

339
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:03,575
<i>There are stipulations in place
that would prevent Zoe's inheritance</i>

340
00:46:03,667 --> 00:46:06,037
<i>during a police investigation
into manslaughter.</i>

341
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:07,535
<i>Look, I see no reason</i>

342
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:10,665
<i>why my stepdaughter's
personal circumstances</i>

343
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,580
<i>should affect a business deal.</i>

344
00:46:12,667 --> 00:46:17,877
<i>What is Hassine Mining's policy
as regards to their code of ethics?</i>

345
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:22,828
<i>Sikong is an international business,</i>

346
00:46:22,917 --> 00:46:26,497
<i>which adheres to strict policies
when it comes to our ethics code.</i>

347
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:28,503
<i>As one of the fastest growing...</i>

348
00:46:33,292 --> 00:46:34,962
Oh, Mr. Kabila, how are you?

349
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,832
<i>I'm afraid
we have to postpone our meeting.</i>

350
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:40,535
I don't understand.
We were...

351
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:42,325
We were set to sign tonight.

352
00:46:42,417 --> 00:46:44,247
<i>Oh, it can't come as a surprise.</i>

353
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:47,543
<i>Zoe Tanner is set to inherit
a large proportion of your company.</i>

354
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:50,035
Approval has been given
for the drilling sites.

355
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:52,535
<i>She is wanted on a murder charge.</i>

356
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,540
<i>Our board are concerned
about accepting your offer.</i>

357
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:01,003
Is your board
reconsidering Sikong's offer?

358
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:04,333
<i>You will need to increase your bid
if you want to remain in the deal.</i>

359
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:21,575
- <i>Madame Hassine.</i>
- I've decided to proceed.

360
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,960
Report only to me on this number.

361
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:28,375
No one else in my organization.
Do you understand?

362
00:47:43,792 --> 00:47:45,292
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

363
00:47:50,917 --> 00:47:53,827
So, fingers under, just hold the top.

364
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:42,578
Okay. Be still.

365
00:48:44,583 --> 00:48:45,883
Do you have kids?

366
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:49,333
No.

367
00:48:50,458 --> 00:48:52,168
- Ah!
- Be still.

368
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:01,170
I've organized an evac.

369
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:04,918
My guy is sending someone to get us out.

370
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,500
How?

371
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:08,043
We drive to Tangiers...

372
00:49:08,792 --> 00:49:10,212
and take the ferry to Spain.

373
00:49:10,708 --> 00:49:13,288
Won't there be checkpoints?

374
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:17,753
The guy they're sending
will bring us new passports...

375
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:19,827
and he'll travel with us.

376
00:49:22,667 --> 00:49:23,917
As my husband.

377
00:49:24,792 --> 00:49:25,792
Your father.

378
00:49:29,417 --> 00:49:30,787
Here, put these on.

379
00:49:31,792 --> 00:49:34,002
Don't take them off.
You sleep in them, okay?

380
00:49:34,292 --> 00:49:36,422
You have the worst taste in shoes.

381
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,500
That's enough.

382
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:10,173
Where are we?

383
00:51:11,292 --> 00:51:13,502
We think they're somewhere
in Mellah district.

384
00:51:13,583 --> 00:51:15,503
How many men have you got on this job?

385
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:19,383
Madame Hassine...
I have this under control.

386
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:21,957
I hope so.

387
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:27,406
He's here.

388
00:51:30,417 --> 00:51:31,417
Turn it off.

389
00:51:42,542 --> 00:51:44,422
What the fuck?

390
00:51:45,083 --> 00:51:46,083
Hey.

391
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:52,923
Hey.

392
00:51:54,042 --> 00:51:55,752
This is a bad idea.

393
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:58,133
You're not reliable in the field.

394
00:52:00,792 --> 00:52:01,962
Let's speak outside.

395
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:03,583
Sure.

396
00:52:17,292 --> 00:52:19,712
There you go. Two passports.

397
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,250
How are you?

398
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:29,168
I mean,
this is a fucking shitshow.

399
00:52:46,417 --> 00:52:48,037
Mm...

400
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:50,462
You shouldn't have come here.

401
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:55,418
Because I'm unreliable?

402
00:52:55,958 --> 00:52:57,748
- That what you really think?
- Yeah.

403
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:01,915
What about you, Sam?

404
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:05,633
Job's over, contract's done.
What're you still doing here?

405
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,420
She has no one.

406
00:53:11,042 --> 00:53:13,712
Let's talk about
what's really going on here.

407
00:53:14,667 --> 00:53:16,207
I know about your kid...

408
00:53:17,583 --> 00:53:20,043
and staying here isn't going to fix it
in some weird way.

409
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,170
Fuck you.

410
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,330
Fuck you.

411
00:54:24,625 --> 00:54:25,995
Do you have any jewelry on?

412
00:54:26,958 --> 00:54:27,958
No.

413
00:54:29,042 --> 00:54:30,252
Put your scarf on.

414
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,500
Hey.

415
00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:56,502
Sam!

416
00:54:56,583 --> 00:54:57,883
- Sam, get me...
- Shut up!

417
00:54:57,958 --> 00:54:59,958
- They're gonna take you.
- What do I do?

418
00:55:00,042 --> 00:55:01,752
- No!
- You have to fight back.

419
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:04,963
- Sam!
- Zoe, you have to fight them.

420
00:55:05,042 --> 00:55:06,518
- Sam.
- You have to fight back.

421
00:55:06,542 --> 00:55:08,582
Don't let them take you into a car
or a building.

422
00:55:08,667 --> 00:55:10,427
That's your chance.
You have to fight back...

423
00:55:10,458 --> 00:55:12,078
Fuck the shut up!

424
00:55:19,875 --> 00:55:20,955
Happy families.

425
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:23,998
- Sam.
- Hey. Fight back.

426
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:25,828
Fight back.

427
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:28,250
Sam!

428
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:32,293
No, no, no! Sam!

429
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:34,995
Fight back, Zoe! Fight back...

430
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:40,037
Sam! Let me go! Help!

431
00:55:40,542 --> 00:55:41,922
Shut up!

Okay? Okay?

Zoe, look at me. It's okay, yeah?

- two phones, and there's...
- Yeah?

453

- There's cash and a gun.
- Yeah?

Okay, come on.

455
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:31,832
How much to buy your taxi?

He says it's not for sale.
It's how he makes his living.

Tell him he can get a better one.
A new one.

458
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,920
Get us out of the city.

Never before
have I seen such incompetence.

This is a disgrace.

Yes, okay, my cell only.

Are we driving to the ferry?

465
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:42,208
No.

466
01:03:42,875 --> 01:03:44,125
No passports.

467
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:46,000
No cover.

So what're we gonna do, then?

I don't know.

470
01:03:55,917 --> 01:03:57,577
I'm... I'm trying to think.

471
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,960
What do you mean, you don't know?
Isn't this your job?

I...

473

Can you take me to Rima?

Yeah.

Sir.

476
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,710
Excuse me, sir!

477
01:04:46,125 --> 01:04:47,285
Excuse me.

478
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,380
That's the entrance.

479
01:05:51,625 --> 01:05:55,245
- Do you think I'll get past security?
- Yeah. I think you'll be fine.

480
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:57,665
That's Rima.

481
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:01,918
Oh, my God.

482
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:06,423
- That's the man from the hotel.
- Yeah. Fuck.

483
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:09,460
She must really hate me.

484
01:06:11,542 --> 01:06:12,832
We don't know that.

485
01:06:17,542 --> 01:06:19,832
- Sam, let's go.
- Stay down. Stay down.

486
01:06:19,917 --> 01:06:21,827
We need to follow him.

487
01:06:21,917 --> 01:06:24,037
This is our chance
to find out what's going on.

488
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:58,580
Get what you need?

489
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
No.

490
01:07:00,333 --> 01:07:01,963
What about the cash?

491
01:07:02,042 --> 01:07:03,792
Client pays when the job's done.

492
01:07:05,583 --> 01:07:08,293
It's not my problem. You hired me.

493
01:07:08,583 --> 01:07:09,793
You didn't deliver.

494
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:13,245
I paid out a lot of money on this job.

495
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:14,793
I fronted your expenses.

496
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:19,787
When one of my men gets killed,
I pay out to their family.

497
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:28,627
That's $10,000.
You want the rest, you finish the job.

498
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:39,503
I heard about what happened downtown.

499
01:07:40,917 --> 01:07:42,247
You should have called.

500
01:07:42,667 --> 01:07:45,457
- I don't like working with you.
- Then why are you here?

501
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:47,790
The girl and her minder saw my face.

502
01:07:48,583 --> 01:07:50,833
If I'm identified, the client will spook.

503
01:07:52,083 --> 01:07:53,753
There'll be no more money.

504
01:07:54,125 --> 01:07:55,375
As I said...

505
01:07:56,167 --> 01:07:57,667
not my problem.

506
01:07:57,750 --> 01:08:00,880
It will be if I'm dead
or in a police cell.

507
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:08,833
Where's the fat one?

508
01:08:09,167 --> 01:08:10,497
He's running late.

509
01:08:12,083 --> 01:08:13,883
You want me to kill the bodyguard?

510
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:16,375
If you can.

511
01:08:20,833 --> 01:08:23,753
8521... That's his car.

512
01:08:31,125 --> 01:08:32,705
This is the last of the cash.

513
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:37,710
If I'm not back in 20 minutes, you drive.

514
01:08:37,792 --> 01:08:40,832
- What do you mean, if you're not back?
- There's no time for this.

515
01:08:41,125 --> 01:08:42,125
Please...

516
01:11:50,458 --> 01:11:51,538
Move!

517
01:12:09,375 --> 01:12:10,415
He's a cop.

518
01:12:10,917 --> 01:12:12,667
Yeah. Yeah.

519
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
He was.

520
01:12:16,125 --> 01:12:18,245
What's that?

521
01:12:20,042 --> 01:12:22,542
It's Rima's username
and password.

522
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,580
If Rima's behind this...

523
01:12:31,167 --> 01:12:32,917
you won't be safe anywhere.

524
01:12:34,958 --> 01:12:36,458
So this will never end.

525
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:40,543
We have to know if Rima is responsible.

526
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:43,075
And if she is?

527
01:12:43,875 --> 01:12:44,915
We get proof...

528
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:47,710
we threaten to expose her...

529
01:12:49,917 --> 01:12:51,077
and we negotiate.

530
01:12:55,042 --> 01:12:56,042
Fuck!

531
01:12:56,667 --> 01:12:58,457
I can get into her phone.

532
01:12:59,167 --> 01:13:00,167
How?

533
01:13:00,667 --> 01:13:02,917
It's linked to the control room
at the kasbah.

534
01:13:03,208 --> 01:13:05,288
Okay.

535
01:13:05,792 --> 01:13:07,382
This password gets me in.

536
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:10,383
That's good. That's good.

537
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:15,500
<i>Mr. Kabila just confirmed</i>

538
01:13:15,583 --> 01:13:17,833
<i>the Izwe Estate Group
are remaining sympathetic.</i>

539
01:13:17,917 --> 01:13:19,747
I'm heading into their offices now.

540
01:13:20,667 --> 01:13:24,127
<i>Present the higher offer
and we will be able to cut out Sikong</i>

541
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:25,458
<i>and close the deal today.</i>

542
01:13:25,542 --> 01:13:28,922
I'm certain Sikong don't have the pockets
to match our higher bid.

543
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,420
<i>Agreed. Good luck.</i>

544
01:14:01,167 --> 01:14:02,417
What are you doing here?

545
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:12,165
This is ridiculous.

546
01:14:13,542 --> 01:14:16,332
I think it would be in your best interest
to let this one go.

547
01:14:19,875 --> 01:14:21,245
You need to drop this deal.

548
01:14:24,292 --> 01:14:28,132
This company is all I have left
of my husband.

549
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:34,080
And if you think
I'm going to let you destroy it,

550
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,540
you are deeply mistaken.

551
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
You're making a massive mistake.

552
01:14:41,083 --> 01:14:42,583
No. We are the bigger company.

553
01:14:43,667 --> 01:14:45,957
You can't match our deal. It's over.

554
01:14:50,875 --> 01:14:52,495
Good luck finding your daughter.

555
01:14:53,917 --> 01:14:56,707
It would be a pity
if anything bad should happen to her.

556
01:15:00,083 --> 01:15:02,003
Sikong wishes her well, of course.

557
01:15:27,458 --> 01:15:28,828
It looks deserted.

558
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:30,630
Yeah. Let's do this.

559
01:16:25,417 --> 01:16:26,497
Zoe?

560
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:29,133
Zoe?

561
01:16:32,917 --> 01:16:33,917
You here?

562
01:16:35,875 --> 01:16:36,875
Hey.

563
01:16:44,792 --> 01:16:46,002
You lied to me.

564
01:16:47,458 --> 01:16:48,458
What?

565
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:51,040
You said you didn't have a kid.

566
01:16:52,083 --> 01:16:53,423
You have a kid.

567
01:16:56,917 --> 01:16:58,877
My personal life is none of your business.

568
01:16:58,958 --> 01:17:00,878
- Why do you do that?
- Do what?

569
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,380
You shut people out.

570
01:17:08,667 --> 01:17:10,747
I've never been able to trust anyone.

571
01:17:13,458 --> 01:17:15,958
- I thought you were different.
- Are you kidding me?

572
01:17:17,083 --> 01:17:19,213
I lost everything for you.

573
01:17:20,042 --> 01:17:23,042
- I killed a fucking cop.
- That was your choice, Sam.

574
01:17:30,458 --> 01:17:32,418
I got pregnant when I was 16.

575
01:17:34,625 --> 01:17:36,745
I didn't have a choice.
I couldn't take care of her.

576
01:17:36,833 --> 01:17:38,293
I had to send her away.

577
01:17:39,333 --> 01:17:40,883
I was just a kid myself.

578
01:17:41,292 --> 01:17:43,462
Well, I was just a kid
when my mom left me.

579
01:17:43,708 --> 01:17:45,578
Yeah, I know. It's in your file.

580
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,080
She committed suicide
when you were eight.

581
01:17:52,917 --> 01:17:54,747
Friends are supposed to trust each other.

582
01:17:55,125 --> 01:17:56,375
I'm not your friend.

583
01:17:58,583 --> 01:17:59,583
Right.

584
01:18:00,917 --> 01:18:01,957
Good to know.

585
01:18:41,458 --> 01:18:42,628
Damn it.

586
01:18:42,875 --> 01:18:44,535
Is there anything I can do?

587
01:18:45,125 --> 01:18:46,125
No.

588
01:19:12,292 --> 01:19:13,882
I do care about you, Zoe.

589
01:19:23,333 --> 01:19:24,753
Do you regret giving her up?

590
01:19:29,167 --> 01:19:30,167
She, um...

591
01:19:32,125 --> 01:19:34,875
She found me.
She... she calls me sometimes.

592
01:19:35,875 --> 01:19:37,285
But you never answer.

593
01:19:38,583 --> 01:19:42,383
Hmm. I'm...
I'm waiting for the... the right time.

594
01:19:59,917 --> 01:20:01,207
It's my birthday.

595
01:20:01,708 --> 01:20:02,708
You're in?

596
01:20:04,083 --> 01:20:05,083
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

597
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:06,383
Okay.

598
01:20:12,292 --> 01:20:15,632
We have decided to overlook
the ongoing investigation.

599
01:20:15,708 --> 01:20:18,628
The board agrees with me
that yourself

600
01:20:18,708 --> 01:20:23,458
and Hassine Mining's prior public record
is exemplary.

601
01:20:24,042 --> 01:20:28,712
We understand that Zoe Tanner
will be treated, uh, accordingly.

602
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:33,038
I was able to persuade
all parties to sign today,

603
01:20:33,125 --> 01:20:35,125
if your offer is significantly...

604
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:39,193
I have the paperwork with me today...

605
01:20:45,417 --> 01:20:50,497
Madame Hassine?
Madame Hassine, what is your offer?

606
01:20:51,917 --> 01:20:54,377
I'm so sorry.
I... I can't proceed with this.

607
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:55,670
Excuse me.

608
01:21:00,333 --> 01:21:02,793
Oh, fuck.

609
01:21:03,583 --> 01:21:05,083
They know where we are.

610
01:21:05,542 --> 01:21:07,502
She must have seen us on the cameras.

611
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:15,035
- What're you doing?
- Locking us in. We'll be safe in here.

612
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:17,500
Fuck.

613
01:21:26,792 --> 01:21:28,476
<i>This is Detective Zuberi.</i>

614
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:32,380
<i>Calling unit 367 to Kasbah residence.
Hassine family.</i>

615
01:21:36,083 --> 01:21:37,253
Get rid of her.

616
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:46,673
A car's coming up.

617
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:49,460
Can't you get the cameras back on?

618
01:21:49,625 --> 01:21:50,745
Uh...

619
01:21:50,833 --> 01:21:51,833
Yeah.

620
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,540
Where is Rima?

621
01:22:10,083 --> 01:22:12,963
People like her don't do
their own shitty work, Zoe.

622
01:22:14,542 --> 01:22:15,542
Of course not.

623
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:26,708
Look.

624
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:29,710
And who the fuck are these guys?

625
01:22:34,667 --> 01:22:36,957
Is there a camera out in this hallway?

626
01:22:37,042 --> 01:22:38,462
Yeah, but they don't all work.

627
01:22:39,083 --> 01:22:41,213
- Can you get it back on?
- Yeah, I'm trying.

628
01:22:41,292 --> 01:22:43,382
Okay. Take it easy. You can do it. Okay?

629
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:45,077
- Okay.
- Okay.

630
01:22:46,583 --> 01:22:47,983
I got it.

631
01:22:48,542 --> 01:22:49,542
He's there.

632
01:22:50,917 --> 01:22:52,577
Where's the other guy?

633
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:09,170
You are way out of your jurisdiction.

634
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:11,330
I'm under orders
to search this property.

635
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:12,750
Who from?

636
01:23:16,083 --> 01:23:18,333
I am not permitted
to let anyone onto this property.

637
01:23:18,958 --> 01:23:20,578
If you have a warrant,
I need to see it,

638
01:23:20,667 --> 01:23:22,957
or speak with your commander
in Casablanca.

639
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:41,630
Copy that.

640
01:23:51,917 --> 01:23:55,207
Fuck me. She's here.

641
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:21,250
Zoe... are you in there?

642
01:24:24,958 --> 01:24:27,328
Zoe.

643
01:24:27,833 --> 01:24:29,633
<i>Zoe, I have to talk to you.</i>

644
01:24:31,375 --> 01:24:34,035
<i>Somebody's blackmailing me.
Open the door.</i>

645
01:24:36,458 --> 01:24:38,078
You left me here to die.

646
01:24:38,833 --> 01:24:40,633
No. No!

647
01:24:40,917 --> 01:24:43,437
<i>Is that
why you called him here? You bitch.</i>

648
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:46,170
Madame Hassine, don't be alarmed.

649
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:48,578
Who are you?

650
01:24:49,625 --> 01:24:50,825
What the fuck?

651
01:24:54,917 --> 01:24:57,077
You're working for Sikong, aren't you?

652
01:24:59,917 --> 01:25:01,077
What's going on?

653
01:25:09,458 --> 01:25:11,288
Don't move.

654
01:25:21,917 --> 01:25:23,497
What the fuck is going on?

655
01:25:23,875 --> 01:25:25,495
This is not her people, is it?

656
01:25:25,792 --> 01:25:28,582
- Obviously not.
- She was telling the truth.

657
01:25:28,667 --> 01:25:30,997
- This is my fault.
- No, it's not your fault, Zoe.

658
01:25:34,708 --> 01:25:36,828
Zoe! Zoe!

659
01:25:44,542 --> 01:25:45,542
Fuck.

660
01:26:04,833 --> 01:26:06,583
Come on, shoot. Shoot.

661
01:26:15,958 --> 01:26:18,538
Can you stand?
Rima, you need to stand up.

662
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:20,325
We need to get some help. Come on.

663
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:22,252
What'd she do?

664
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:28,670
What did you do? What was it?

665
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:35,670
What did she do?

666
01:26:38,375 --> 01:26:39,375
Oh, no.

667
01:26:39,875 --> 01:26:41,665
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

668
01:26:42,708 --> 01:26:44,828
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

669
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,920
The gun. Give me the gun!

670
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:54,963
Shit. Okay. Okay. Calm down.

671
01:26:58,958 --> 01:27:00,418
Oh, for fuck's sake.

672
01:27:08,792 --> 01:27:11,002
It's her birthday, it's in the file.
It's...

673
01:27:13,083 --> 01:27:14,333
It's her birthday.

674
01:27:19,458 --> 01:27:21,458
No!

675
01:27:22,292 --> 01:27:23,962
No! Go! Rima, go...

676
01:27:25,292 --> 01:27:26,922
Please! Please!

677
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:46,002
Sam, are you okay?

678
01:27:46,083 --> 01:27:47,673
Yeah, I'm okay.

679
01:27:51,875 --> 01:27:53,205
We need to get out.

680
01:27:54,208 --> 01:27:57,498
Rima! Rima,
we need to get outside! Come on!

681
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,790
It's Zuberi. I hired him.
You can trust him.

682
01:28:37,542 --> 01:28:38,542
Sam.

683
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:02,880
Call her.

684
01:29:03,083 --> 01:29:04,133
Your daughter.

685
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:07,332
Okay? Promise me.

686
01:29:10,208 --> 01:29:11,288
I promise.

687
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
You gotta go.

688
01:29:19,958 --> 01:29:20,958
Yeah.

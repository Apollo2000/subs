2
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,604
Retirement, here I come, motherfuckers.

3
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,740
Ah.

4
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,242
What's your name again, baby?

5
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,197
I'm still Sindy, baby!

6
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,081
Well, hello again, Sindy baby.

7
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,286
- How about a little bubbly?
- Oh, yeah!

8
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,340
Whoa!

9
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,092
You got a little on you!

10
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,174
Come here.

11
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,012
Woo-woo!

12
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,146
- ...thirteen, fourteen...
- Yeah, baby!

13
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,150
...fifteen...

14
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,611
You're so strong!

15
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,478
In position.

16
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,529
Woo-hoo!

17
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,163
You like that?

18
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,320
You know I do!

19
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:39,988
You got it, babe!

20
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,327
<i>You're such a great dancer.</i>

21
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,794
Oh, yes!

22
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,955
- Come here, honey.
- Oh, these hips don't lie.

23
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,506
- Rawr!
- You like that?

24
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,840
I love it! Come here.

25
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,893
Easy now, Disco Man.

26
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,604
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh!

27
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,276
It's blow time, mister.

28
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,701
- Oh, is that an order?
- Mm-hmm.

29
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,780
Be my guest.

30
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,315
Oh, yeah. <i>Hello there.</i>

31
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,460
This retirement thing
is really working out.

32
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,996
<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>

33
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,209
Bang.

34
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,759
Moving in.

35
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:43,931
Hey!

36
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,234
Oh, God, fuck!

37
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,614
I fuckin' love that song!

38
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,030
- <i>All you, Facundo.</i>
- Oh!

39
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,751
Why?

40
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,118
- You got old, Michael.
- Sindy bab...

41
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,422
Not that old, after all.

42
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,663
Karl, we're ready
to get the fuck out of here.

43
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,337
<i>At your service!
Please come onboard.</i>

44
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,808
Yeah. It's done. We're heading back now.

45
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,981
<i>Fasten your seatbelts.</i>

46
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,904
<i>Enjoy the ride.</i>

47
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,193
Woo-woo!

48
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,741
Great job, Facundo.
See you back at the mansion.

49
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,695
Yes, ma'am. Safe flight.

50
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,524
Okay, sweetie,
Dr. Becker will see you now.

51
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,990
If I can get you to take
a nice deep breath in.

52
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,242
And out.

53
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,780
And once more.

54
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,285
And out.

55
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,080
Oh.

56
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,003
Lung's good... considering.

57
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,298
It's never too late to get
that metal removed.

58
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:40,972
Lift the arm up.

59
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,604
Gosh, it must hurt.

60
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,143
Eh, it's not too bad.

61
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,724
Okay, you can lower it.

62
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,861
How's the hearing
in that left ear, Duncan?

63
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:57,939
What was that?

64
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,855
Funny. Very funny.

65
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,066
Did you get all the shots I recommended?

66
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,775
Hep-A? Shingles?

67
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,155
All good.

68
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,411
Okay. If you lie down
on your side, please.

69
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,957
And I'll get you to bring your knees
up to your chest, please.

70
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,631
Okay.

71
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,133
And deep breath.

72
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,515
When people ask me why I save
the prostate exam till last,

73
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,592
I just think it's nice for my patients
to have something fun to look forward to.

74
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,560
And exhale.

75
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,105
We're done.

76
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,646
Oh, I baked a pear tartine.

77
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,373
- You want some?
- Thanks.

78
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,829
All right!

79
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,909
Here you go.

80
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,369
Homemade.

81
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,750
What are you looking forward to most
about retiring?

82
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,086
Don't know. The normal stuff.

83
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,378
The most dangerous time for men
is the year they retire.

84
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,219
They take up some crazy sport.

85
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,680
They ditch their wife and fuck girls
younger than their daughters.

86
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,391
They think they're king of the world.

87
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,770
It's not always the things
I test for that get you.

88
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:20,113
We got you covered for cancer
and heart disease and basic human biology.

89
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,031
But sometimes the killer's in your head.

90
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:27,195
The mental side of retirement. Phew.

91
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,780
It can be deadly.

92
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,279
Mmm.

93
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,907
Wow! This pie is great. Hmm.

94
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,079
What about cigarettes?

95
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,584
I quit. Good for you.

96
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,237
<i>Yes, going through your
financial report, the good news,</i>

97
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:54,221
yes, is that you've got
no financial worries at all.

98
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:02,111
Will you be making the same
charity donation again this year,

99
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,940
$200,000, yes?

100
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,736
- Yes.
- Yes.

101
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,909
Same recipient, the trust, yes?

102
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,655
- Yes.
- Yes.

103
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,330
And from the same bank account,

104
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,538
the Montana Union Credit Bank, yes?

105
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,707
Yes.

106
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,709
As per your employment agreement,

107
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:27,014
Damocles will be matching
your pension contributions,

108
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,259
which have been substantial.

109
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,721
You have put away the maximum

110
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,890
and the company plan has seen it grow
at a rate of a good six percent per year.

111
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:40,438
You can draw half of that
on your official retirement date,

112
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,730
which is in...

113
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,231
Fourteen days.

114
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,779
Yes!

115
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,488
Then in 14 days,

116
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,659
Damocles will be cutting you a check

117
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,696
for the best part of...

118
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:59,164
eight million two hundred and seven thousand five
hundred and twenty-three dollars and four cents.

119
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,835
How about that, Mr. Vizla?

120
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,350
You have properties in four states, yes?

121
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:17,598
I just need to know which one
you'll be retiring to so...

122
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,062
Use the Florida address.

123
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,811
The Florida address, yes.

124
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,567
Keeping the old golf handicap down?

125
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,148
Yes?

126
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,780
Yes.

127
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:29,859
Yes.

128
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,294
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

129
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,159
I shall fear no evil,

130
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,706
for you are with me.

131
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,959
Your rod and your staff comfort me...

132
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,877
And I will dwell in
the house of the Lord forever.

133
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,385
Speak.

134
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,850
- You wanted to talk.
<i>- You watching me?</i>

135
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,138
Yep.

136
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,725
We need to meet.

137
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,810
- Jimmy's in ten.
<i>- I'll be there.</i>

138
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,124
Dom Pérignon, 2004.

139
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,912
You remembered.

140
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,211
- It's good to see you, Duncan.
- What happened to Michael?

141
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:31,547
I figured you might show up,
so I brought you this.

142
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,893
Apparently, he'd been partying
in his big-ass McMansion down in Chile

143
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,009
for days when he got attacked.

144
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,096
- And for you, sir?
- No.

145
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,805
- You're not drinking?
- I quit.

146
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,483
What's this about, Vivian?

147
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,570
Michael was the fourth dead Damocles agent
in the past month.

148
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:00,201
Our intel says Michael's killer
is tied to a Russian outlet.

149
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,748
They hired some Mexican hit man

150
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,748
by the name of Pedro Gonzalez Gonzales.

151
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,251
He's currently staking out
in Belarus, Russia.

152
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:12,666
Your old boss, Blut,
sanctioned a revenge hit.

153
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:16,585
A million dollar bullet
to tell this <i>pendejo</i>

154
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,933
that we are not to be fucked with.

155
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,682
Well, Blut fired me.

156
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,769
Oh, don't be such a cry-baby.

157
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:27,649
He lets go of everybody at 50.
You know that. Company fucking policy.

158
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,439
You can't be a hit man with Alzheimer's.

159
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,153
Get one of the young guys, then.

160
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,112
Technically, you're still active
for the next two weeks.

161
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:42,447
This needs somebody
with more finesse, more...

162
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,662
experience.

163
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,539
Why don't you do it?

164
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:48,673
He wants you.

165
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,667
The Black Kaiser.

166
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,686
...got me some Lip Smackers for
the store just like you said I should.

167
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,158
- Oh, the flavored ones!
- Yeah!

168
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,200
I got strawberry, I got raspberry,
I got rhubarb.

169
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,485
- But do they taste good?
- They do.

170
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,207
I was thinking, maybe in the summer,

171
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,669
I could do a promotional tie-in
with the pies.

172
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,040
- Did you say "Italian"?
- No, <i>a tie-in.</i>

173
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,207
- It's like marketing.
- Like a commercial.

174
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,046
- Absolutely!
- Like on TV.

175
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:22,051
Do you remember that TV series
that I was telling you about?

176
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,764
Mm-hmm.
You have to start it from the beginning.

177
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,465
I got it in the box across the street.

178
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,055
Now, it's British,
but you can put the subtitles on.

179
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,651
- It sounds kind of religious.
- It's not as religious as you might think.

180
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,728
Do you find Jesus attractive?

181
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,074
Oh, my, Jesus is a handsome man, isn't he?

182
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,807
Hey.

183
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,138
He likes you, man.

184
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,644
What's his name?

185
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,402
He doesn't have one.

186
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,441
I like dogs with human names.

187
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,784
- Like what?
- Like "Rusty."

188
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,277
I don't know anyone human named Rusty.

189
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,913
- Isn't that a dog's name?
- No, it's human.

190
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,741
Okay, whatever you say, man.

191
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,077
He's only 50 bucks.

192
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,526
I don't need a dog. Okay.

193
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,482
<i>Finally you're free.</i>

194
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,812
<i>After all these years.</i>

195
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,981
<i>I want to take a picture of this moment.</i>

196
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:01,839
Pretty good, huh?

197
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,633
Ah.

198
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:46,921
Rusty?

199
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,005
Shit...

200
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,076
Oh, shit!

201
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,064
<i>It's not about who you are
or what you think...</i>

202
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,464
<i>Just imagine. You and me.</i>

203
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,540
<i>There's a strong energy between us, right?</i>

204
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,916
<i>I quite enjoy writing my feelings
down in a journal.</i>

205
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,376
<i>The bond between
an elephant cub and its mother</i>

206
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,007
<i>is unmistakable...</i>

207
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,979
<i>- Speak.</i>
- I got your message.

208
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,233
Which one?

209
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,110
The first or the 15th?

210
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,194
You only get 30 seconds.

211
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,238
Blut won't take no for an answer.

212
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,203
<i>You didn't hang up, so I assume
you want to know how much.</i>

213
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,044
Two million. One now, one when it's done.

214
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,290
It's still a no.

215
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:27,621
This shit-spit really struggles
with that two-letter word.

216
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,840
What the fuck else you got going on?

217
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:30,958
A lot.

218
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,510
You don't strike me as a man with a hobby.

219
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,669
- Your 30 seconds is up.
<i>- Jesus, Mary, fuck.</i>

220
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,637
<i>Are you retired or ret...</i>

221
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,231
It's $2 million.
Don't make me fuckin' beg.

222
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,937
Leave the file on the company server.

223
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,317
<i>You don't have to be such...</i>

224
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,243
You did well.

225
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,332
Though,
your description of me as a shit-spit

226
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,825
didn't go unnoticed.

227
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,167
Does he scare you?

228
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,264
You fucking scare me.

229
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,932
Just talking to the Black Kaiser
makes you nervous.

230
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:22,762
You're shaking.

231
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,267
You should just forget about him
and move on.

232
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,738
Who can forget about the Black Kaiser?

233
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,357
So very special!

234
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,164
This is a bad idea.

235
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,451
Spare me the lecture.

236
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,624
Unless you have a better way
of putting him in our crosshairs

237
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,753
and saving me $8 million.

238
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,290
So shut the fuck up

239
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,705
and let's go with my plan

240
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,553
and send him to Belarus to die.

241
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,218
If he accepts this assignment,

242
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:02,178
he'll expect $1 million in his account
before he makes a move.

243
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,551
I need authorization to make it happen.

244
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,766
Ha! Ha! Yah!

245
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,863
Ha, ha! Yah!

246
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:05,663
As you know,
swords are synonymous with Damocles,

247
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,871
but this...

248
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:10,451
...this is my most special sword.

249
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,668
Owned by the great
German general Arminius,

250
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,050
butcher of the Romans
at Teutoburg Forest.

251
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:23,008
The handle is made from Roman bone.

252
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:28,638
My father was a big fan
of this kind of stuff.

253
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,523
Papa.

254
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:38,818
Thank you for your incredible sword show
and touching story.

255
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,112
Now, let's get down to business.

256
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,203
We have some questions regarding
the purchase of Damocles.

257
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:48,699
Accounts show this year,
your liabilities are at 29 million,

258
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:53,874
yet next year your liabilities
are predicted to be paid off.

259
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:54,865
Correct.

260
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,996
In fact, we were surprised to see
that they have become revenue.

261
00:22:58,585 --> 00:22:59,585
Correct.

262
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:03,378
This seems to be done in order
to inflate the value of your company.

263
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,965
We control the pensions
of our former employees.

264
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:11,102
They pay into our fund,
we match their contributions,

265
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,381
and manage the investments.
Please do explain, Mr Blut.

266
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:20,688
It's our company policy that all
our agents must retire at the age of 50.

267
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:25,611
We have a plethora of agents
who have now reached this milestone.

268
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:30,373
Their combined fund
adds up to $29 million.

269
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,740
How do you consider this income?

270
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:37,038
If our agents were to die
in the field of duty

271
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,504
or in an unspecified accident,

272
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:45,299
the clause in their contract states
that Damocles would be the beneficiary.

273
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,641
And you are assuming they will die?

274
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,429
I don't <i>assume </i>they will die,

275
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,520
I guarantee it.

276
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,981
If you can uphold that guarantee,

277
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,597
we will move forward with this deal.

278
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,980
<i>Santé.</i>

279
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:07,653
Ah!

280
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,766
The train woke me up again.

281
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,560
I can't sleep.

282
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,064
Go back to bed, baby.

283
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,610
I'll be back.

284
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,984
Do you want to go
somewhere else for a few days?

285
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,864
Let the kid get a good night of sleep.

286
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:12,111
You pay me for sex.
My regular life is not for sale.

287
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,786
How much for two nights?

288
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,211
He's not your kid.

289
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,205
I know.

290
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,127
How much?

291
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,508
THE MINSK PLAZA

292
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,635
Excuse me.

293
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,427
Hotel service.

294
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,434
Madam.

295
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,057
Yes.

296
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,654
Yes, I'll call maintenance right away.

297
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,283
Thank you so much.

298
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,884
A woman and her son
are locked inside.

299
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:15,842
These doors have high security deadlocks
for our VIP guests.

300
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,005
We can't release it from the outside.

301
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,723
I have to drill it.

302
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,349
Okay, but try to keep it down.

303
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,162
Speak!

304
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,569
No fucking way!

305
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,492
Yes, you said that two days ago.

306
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,294
When the fuck is he coming?

307
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:50,085
What is that fucking sound?

308
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,799
Shit!

309
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,384
What is that fucking sound?

310
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:56,797
What the hell is this?

311
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,643
You know we are in here!

312
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,428
We are so sorry, sir.

313
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,392
What?

314
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,681
We're just...

315
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,024
- Sir!
<i>- ¡Oye, cabrón!</i>

316
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,806
Sit down.

317
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,563
Shh.

318
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,356
Be quiet.

319
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,316
I need some answers.

320
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,865
Nod if you understand.

321
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,119
I was sent to kill you.

322
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:08,751
But it looks
like I'm the target here, right?

323
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,750
Yes.

324
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,131
Do you know who ordered this?

325
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,628
I don't know anything.

326
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,667
I don't know anything.

327
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,467
I need to make sure
you're telling me the truth.

328
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:24,968
I'm not lying!

329
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,604
I swear!

330
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,306
I'm not lying!

331
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,113
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

332
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,545
Speak.

333
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,008
Do you have authorization
to hire me for the Belarus job?

334
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:05,640
Yes. The first 50 percent is sitting
in a payable account, ready to go.

335
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
Wire it over.

336
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:15,809
Boom.

337
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,067
One million dollars...

338
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,066
sent.

339
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,946
Okay, the job is done.
I'll send you a picture.

340
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,200
Wait, what? Duncan...

341
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,161
Shit!

342
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,276
<i>- Duncan...</i>
- I want the second half

343
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,456
<i>of my payment in 24 hours.</i>

344
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,297
Vivian, somebody set me up over here.

345
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,222
You better pray
you have nothing to do with it.

346
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,316
- Duncan...
- Don't ever contact me again.

347
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,178
Spank me again!

348
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,586
Let's go.

349
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,784
Let's leave.

350
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,744
Come on, let's go. Don't look.

351
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,749
Somebody call the police!

352
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,882
You make all this money
from killing people?

353
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,276
We could have been killed up there.

354
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,323
One day...

355
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,784
even you will get killed.

356
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,455
Don't come near me again.

357
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,453
How nice to see you, Ms. Vivian!

358
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,782
Where's the shit-spit?

359
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,025
Mr. Blut is busy.

360
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,446
He's not answering my calls.
What the fuck is he doing?

361
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,004
A cup of tea to calm down, Ms. Vivian?

362
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,581
This is not a convenient time.

363
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,587
I don't give a shit what time it is.

364
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,763
You tried to kill the Black Kaiser

365
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:48,678
with some low-rent Mexican clowns?

366
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,430
Yeah, that plan worked well.

367
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,262
I told you we should
leave him the fuck alone.

368
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,135
- You worry too much.
- You have to pay him everything now.

369
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,852
I don't have to do shit
until his birthday.

370
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,147
Right.

371
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,936
Pay him the second half of his fee

372
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:10,027
so we don't have to look over
our fucking shoulder

373
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,573
for the rest of our lives.

374
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,695
Okay, do it.

375
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,333
Smart move.

376
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,040
I'll send in the A-team.

377
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,580
They'll get it done.

378
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,373
Whatever.
As long as you pay him.

379
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,339
These are all the properties he owns?

380
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,848
Y-Yes, all of them.

381
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:40,100
I can't see where it says one of them
is his actual permanent address.

382
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:41,981
His home base?

383
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,694
- He... He...
- Florida? Texas?

384
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,193
Where does he live, Paul?

385
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,065
He doesn't tell me much.

386
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,152
He moves around a lot. Yeah, I...

387
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:54,657
I know that from... from his,
uh, accounts.

388
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,241
I want to see these accounts.

389
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,752
The profit and loss, expenses.
I want everything.

390
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,120
Please let me go.

391
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:13,798
Yeah, it's all in there, under V.
V for Vizla.

392
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,925
Duncan V-Vizla.

393
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,938
For 20 years, I... I worked for him.

394
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,726
- Please let me go.
- Thank you, Paul.

395
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,725
Y-You're welcome.

396
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,878
- You've been very helpful.
- I can still be helpful.

397
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,362
I can call and s-send him a message.

398
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:36,816
That's how we do it. Talk to him.
I'm good at that. And you can trace him.

399
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,738
Or we could meet at a coffee shop

400
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,366
or... or at a park.

401
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,333
He trusts me. He always says that.

402
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,373
"You and me, Paul, I trust you."

403
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,497
He does. Yes, he really trusts me. Yes!

404
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,133
Take all the files.

405
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,506
Let's start with Florida.

406
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,974
I have a perfect outfit.

407
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:09,323
No, we didn't deliver any logs
and we only deliver what we get asked.

408
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:12,438
Logs are expensive. It's not like
they grow on trees, you know!

409
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,987
Yeah, I know, but my woodpile got filled.

410
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,241
I mean, that doesn't just happen.

411
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,993
Sounds to me
like you've got yourself a magic woodpile.

412
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,656
Golden goose would be better,
but we don't get to pick and choose

413
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,615
what sort of supernatural events
we witness.

414
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,829
Oh, hey, there's your neighbor!

415
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,916
Did you happen to see anything peculiar

416
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,091
out by your place
over the past couple days?

417
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:35,050
Perhaps some sort of supernatural event
of someone dumping a truckload of logs?

418
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,803
- No.
- This young lady rents up where you are.

419
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:40,465
You can probably see her cabin
from your place across the lake.

420
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,220
Maybe not, I don't know.

421
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,926
Seems her woodpile
got filled up as if by magic!

422
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:51,404
- Shit! I'm so sorry.
- Let it be. Let it be.

423
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,572
I should have fixed that door years ago.

424
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:57,491
Well, well, well,
look who's having himself a birthday!

425
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,292
And baking a Betty Crocker.
So much better when you make it yourself.

426
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,494
You know, I got all sorts
of fun party stuff.

427
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,617
I got streamers and balloons and poppers.

428
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:05,584
Come on back this way.

429
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,583
I got paper plates
with Disney folk on 'em and napkins.

430
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,088
<i>...easy way to make some delicious cakes.</i>

431
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,172
<i>You'll love these recipes</i>

432
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,757
<i>just as much as I do.</i>

433
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:23,846
<i>...you may find this process
even more satisfying</i>

434
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:24,971
<i>with the smell wafting...</i>

435
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:06,514
Hello?

436
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:12,975
Hi there!
Um, I'm looking for apartment 506.

437
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,444
What's it say on the door?

438
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,976
Sorry! I didn't see that.

439
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,775
- Come in.
- Great! Um...

440
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,612
I've been expecting you.

441
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,791
So, is your name Mr. Vizla?

442
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:36,836
- Mr. Duncan Viz...
- You want a drink before we get started?

443
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,631
No. No drink, thanks.

444
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:42,085
I'm really just here
regarding the questionnaire.

445
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:46,096
- Oh, yeah.
- We are making a survey...

446
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,766
So, what are you into? Being hit?

447
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,233
Strangled?

448
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,773
You like takin' it up the ass?

449
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,016
It's not him.

450
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,358
- What'd you say to me?
- It's not him!

451
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,243
What'd you fucking say?
What the fuck? My door!

452
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,352
Who the fuck are you? Fuck this!

453
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,946
- Do you have a fucking warrant?
- Who do you pay rent to?

454
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:10,865
I didn't fucking touch her.
You're paying for the fucking door!

455
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,670
Fuck! My teeth!

456
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,790
- Who do you pay rent to?!
- Shit!

457
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,497
What are you fucking talking about?

458
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,545
Some fucking accountant.

459
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,591
- His name Lomas?
- Yeah. That's his name. Why?

460
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,006
This is fucking stupid!

461
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,094
I'm not saying anyth...

462
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
Sindy!

463
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,101
Sindy, enough! Let's go!

464
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:37,976
- <i>Speak.</i>
- Yeah.

465
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,855
Nah, he's not here.
We're moving to the next location.

466
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,953
<i>Don't leave any witnesses behind,
you hear me?</i>

467
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,409
Yeah, whatever you say, ma'am.

468
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,198
<i>I'm serious. And call me
from the next location.</i>

469
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,043
<i>- Find him.</i>
- Okay, we're on it.

470
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,947
I think he's dead now, Sindy.

471
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,327
Let's go to breakfast.

472
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,996
Good idea. Eggs and toast.
You're paying this time, goddamn it.

473
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,542
Yeah, I'm fucking starving.

474
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,588
Thanks.

475
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,638
- Winter coffee?
- Yes, please.

476
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,613
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

477
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,949
It's funny we're neighbors.

478
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,962
Yes. That is funny.

479
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,221
You live in the house with the big porch.

480
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,314
Yes.

481
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,895
I live in the gray cabin,
just across the lake.

482
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,533
- It's so funny.
- That is funny.

483
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:12,867
I like it here.

484
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,662
Me too.

485
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:21,037
- It's peaceful.
- Yeah.

486
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,433
It makes me peaceful.

487
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,261
Me too.

488
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,769
- I'm so, so sorry.
- It's totally fine.

489
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,693
It's okay. It's fine.

490
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:41,771
Okay.

491
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,727
<i>I don't know, man!</i>

492
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,349
It's not my house!

493
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,061
- It's just...
- Boom!

494
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,439
...give a shit if we stay here.

495
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,194
- Hey, man.
- The place is always empty.

496
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:30,446
I need you to answer
a simple question, okay?

497
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,659
Who do you pay rent to?

498
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,530
Is it Duncan Vizla?

499
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,367
Bro, we don't live here! We don't pay.

500
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,043
- I don't owe shit!
- Well...

501
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,041
- Why are you doing this?
- I don't...

502
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:43,003
All right, I'm coming.

503
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,088
Who the hell are you?
Where's Shotgun Frank?

504
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,510
You should probably get the fuck
out of here, sweetie.

505
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,774
- I'm just here to...
- Whatever.

506
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,838
- Wrong place at the wrong time.
- Please!

507
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,428
What the fuck is going on in there?

508
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,215
I'm outta here!

509
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,102
Whoa!

510
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,440
Come on, I wasn't gonna...

511
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,863
Come on, let's get out of here.

512
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,110
<i>Speak.</i>

513
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,198
No, ma'am. He's not here either.

514
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:19,373
<i>- We got one more place to check.</i>
<i>- </i>That better be the place then, Facundo.

515
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,957
- Come on! Let's go!
- Right.

516
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,424
You okay? You're making a mess.

517
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,218
These are very good.

518
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,216
You're not from around here, are you?

519
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,350
No.

520
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,430
- Like Europe or something?
- Mm.

521
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:26,685
You don't have the same look
as people around here either.

522
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,230
What's that?

523
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,278
Resigned to a slow death.

524
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,151
No future.

525
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,111
No money.

526
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,322
No work.

527
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:41,368
Well, I'm not working anymore.
I'm retired.

528
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,203
What was your job?

529
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,535
I was in the funeral business.

530
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:52,545
Where?

531
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,545
Different places.

532
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,219
Mostly overseas.

533
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,135
A...

534
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,720
A traveling funeral business?

535
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,474
Yeah, well...

536
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:08,228
Well, people die traveling
in foreign countries.

537
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,772
- Americans.
- Hmm.

538
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,612
I go over and I take care of it.

539
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,108
Oh.

540
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,607
How many countries have you been to?

541
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,112
Ninety-nine.

542
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,279
Most people don't even know 99 countries.

543
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:22,825
Andorra.

544
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:26,210
Albania. Austria. Australia.

545
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,415
Antigua. Angola.

546
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,879
Algeria. Afghanistan.

547
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:31,959
Argentina.

548
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:33,628
Azerbaijan.

549
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,508
That was ten.

550
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,929
And I'm only at the As, so, yeah.

551
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,181
Do you speak any languages?

552
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,054
Eight.

553
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,516
You should give a class at school,
here in town.

554
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,313
About what?

555
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,904
Tell the kids about the world.

556
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,315
How many teachers have actually
seen the places you have?

557
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,275
Would you do it?

558
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:58,945
No.

559
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:01,572
Why not?

560
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,662
I don't know how to talk to kids.

561
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,209
Oh, right.

562
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,548
- <i>I'll rip your fucking arms off!</i>
- Speak.

563
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:27,097
Yeah, we're all out of luck here, too.
He ain't at this last location, either.

564
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:36,976
- Go, girl! USA! USA!
- I'll rip your spindly fucking arms off!

565
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:38,776
- What?
- One, two, three.

566
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,461
Can you get it done already, goddamn it?

567
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:41,777
- Four...
- Fuck!

568
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,284
Sorry, I can't hear you.

569
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:46,655
You better tell Hilde
her boyfriend is not gonna be happy

570
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,624
if she doesn't find the Black Kaiser.

571
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:51,334
Stop fighting.

572
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,665
Stay still, Meatloaf.

573
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,380
She's replaceable.

574
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,460
Come on!

575
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:56,594
You all are.

576
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,340
Yeah, I can't remember all that.

577
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,722
Better not call me again without a plan.

578
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,889
I'm sorry, it's really noisy in here.
Can you repeat?

579
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,138
Unless you have a serious death wish.

580
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:06,721
<i>Come on!</i>

581
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:08,765
One, two,

582
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,076
- three, four...
- Hold him down!

583
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,730
I'm doing the best I can, okay?

584
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:13,693
Fuck!

585
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,611
Fuck it.

586
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,821
- Get out of the way.
- Come on!

587
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:28,197
- Fucking hell!
- Oh, no, you killed him!

588
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,369
Let's get the fuck out of here.

589
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:33,577
Get back here, you fucking sacks of shit!

590
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,495
- He's alive!
- I'll fucking kill you!

591
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,464
Who the fuck do you think you are?

592
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,030
All right, all right. One more time.

593
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,452
Last time, okay?

594
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,077
All right.

595
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:12,199
The kukri is an arterial weapon.

596
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,290
Perfect for slicing through flesh.

597
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,499
But it sucks at...

598
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:20,384
- Stabbing!
- There you go. Let's see what it can do.

599
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:22,588
Here we go.

600
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,255
And here. Boom!

601
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:33,266
All right, all right, all right.

602
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,732
Have a look at it.

603
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,313
Pass it around.

604
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,828
Good. Any questions? Let's start with you.

605
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:49,155
How do they bury people in India?

606
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,169
They burn 'em.

607
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:08,006
And if the man dies first,
they'll burn the wife as well. Alive.

608
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:14,096
- What clothes do they wear in Africa?
- Summer clothes.

609
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,226
White. A lot of red.

610
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:24,527
- Yeah?
- Do they eat turkey in Turkey?

611
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,361
Very good, very good.

612
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,986
No, chicken.

613
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,333
And they put 'em on skewers.

614
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,661
Right, last one.

615
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:38,668
Do they speak American in England?

616
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:45,796
They don't speak a lot.

617
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,839
All right. Have any of you ever seen...

618
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:54,263
a dead body that's been in the sun
for three weeks?

619
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,558
No.

620
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,391
Well, take a look at this, then.

621
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,404
Here you go. Pay attention to his face.

622
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,272
You can hardly see it anymore.

623
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:06,605
Cool.

624
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:26,837
How did it go?

625
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,553
Pretty good, I think.

626
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,184
They liked the knife.

627
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,267
Oh.

628
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,606
That was a pretty cool knife.

629
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,524
I guess.

630
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:01,495
Finally!

631
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,706
That fucking accountant
was hiding something.

632
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:14,094
Hey, what are you guys looking for?
You really think you're gonna find him?

633
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,847
Shut up, Junkie Jane.

634
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,636
You guys are so fucking boring.

635
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,188
I said, shut up, Jane.

636
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,915
- Hey there.
- I brought you something.

637
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:44,829
Oh.

638
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,076
Uh, thanks.

639
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,756
You told me
how much you like knives, so...

640
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,927
I thought this might be something.

641
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,264
It comes in black if you like that better.

642
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:01,766
I...

643
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:06,613
- I don't know how to shoot. I...
- That's okay.

644
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,270
I'm a teacher now.

645
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,400
Remember?

646
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,909
<i>I would do anything for you,
my love.</i>

647
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:18,831
<i>Anything.</i>

648
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,119
That's my girl.

649
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,202
I miss you so much.

650
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,293
I know, baby.

651
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:26,832
Tell me again, what is it you plan to do?

652
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,335
I will kill him for you.

653
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,799
Oh, yeah!

654
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:32,513
I love you.

655
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:39,810
Shit! Imagine how much dope
you can get for 200,000.

656
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,848
- Give me that.
- Can we cash this?

657
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,772
What are you talking about?
Let me see.

658
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,402
I got one more here
made out to some fucking charity shit.

659
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,528
Awesome!

660
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,488
Let's cash 'em all. We'll be rich.

661
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,688
Shut up, Jane.

662
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,030
A charity.

663
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,405
I've got two more here.

664
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,788
2005, 2009.

665
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:10,462
Well, the charity is not what's important,

666
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,304
it's the bank account.

667
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:16,589
Fuck me. The Montana Union Credit Bank
in Triple Oak.

668
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,472
The fuck is Triple Oak?

669
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,259
Looks cold.
Why the fuck would he live there?

670
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,186
- Why wouldn't he?
- No shit.

671
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:28,685
Looks like we're on the move.

672
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,482
Let's go.
We have a long drive ahead of us.

673
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,899
All right. Here we go.

674
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:19,736
Always two hands.

675
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:22,991
One thumb there, one right there. Right?

676
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:31,876
Then when you feel you have the target,
you squeeze the trigger nice and easy.

677
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:33,964
Click. Got it?

678
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:39,840
Now it's loaded.

679
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:41,258
It's all yours.

680
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,010
Two hands.

681
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:57,900
That's it.

682
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:24,677
It's okay.

683
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,763
It's okay. We'll get you something else.

684
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:29,848
I still have the receipt.

685
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,277
I have never heard
about winter coffee before.

686
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:44,196
No?

687
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:47,831
I use bourbon and maple syrup.

688
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,713
You really like animals, huh?

689
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,670
Yes.

690
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:06,428
I used to have a dog.

691
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:17,305
We don't have to talk about it.

692
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,490
I had this job when I was 13.

693
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:25,315
I liked it a lot.

694
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,698
I was Santa's helper at the library.

695
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:31,618
And, uh...

696
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,495
this one day,
it was just me and him there.

697
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:39,093
He was more drunk than usual.

698
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:41,875
He just came up to me.

699
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:44,506
Hit me.

700
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:47,426
Real hard.

701
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,715
So hard, I landed on the floor.

702
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,850
And then he...

703
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:05,201
I always imagined what it would be like...

704
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,113
to find him.

705
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:10,908
Surprise him.

706
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,788
I would have a gun in my hand.

707
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:17,923
"Sit down," I would say.

708
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,964
And then I would tell him
what he did to me.

709
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:25,422
To my life.

710
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:29,512
I guess I would tell him what he did.

711
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,850
And he would listen.

712
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,140
Tell him how that day
never left my thoughts.

713
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:41,355
Never. And then...

714
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,276
click.

715
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:49,568
It would all go away.

716
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,540
I would never have to see him again
when I close my eyes.

717
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,254
It would all go away.

718
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,434
Do you think it would be difficult
to kill someone?

719
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,064
I don't know.

720
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,597
Oh, hey there, Mr. Duncan!

721
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:47,667
- How are you doing? What can I do you for?
- I'm looking for a gift.

722
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,125
Well, you came to the right place.

723
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:52,886
- It's for a girl.
- Oh! What kind of gift?

724
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,471
Something normal.

725
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:03,228
Shit, man.

726
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,975
I got visuals on the target. Right there.

727
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:10,444
Here we go.

728
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:13,032
<i>Sindy, he's coming your way.</i>

729
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:45,896
Hi.

730
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:47,774
What's the problem?

731
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:50,647
Do I look like a mechanic?

732
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,113
Uh...

733
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:56,906
I don't know. It just died.

734
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,124
Did you call a tow truck?

735
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,866
My phone's dead, too.

736
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,383
Could I charge it in your car?

737
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:06,750
Not in this car.

738
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:08,839
Goddamn it!

739
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:10,712
Well, um...

740
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,804
Do you live far from here?

741
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:22,709
Thanks for helping me out.

742
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,563
You're welcome.

743
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,068
Okay.

744
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,070
Thanks.

745
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,786
The soonest they can come out
is ten in the morning.

746
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,245
Wow, look at that storm.

747
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:53,755
You hungry?

748
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,297
Mm-hmm.

749
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:31,835
You get the couch.

750
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:44,597
You're cute for an older guy.

751
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,990
I said I'd never fuck anyone
older than my dad.

752
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:04,583
Mm-hmm...

753
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,837
Oh, yeah!

754
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:24,025
Goddamn, Sindy!

755
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:27,655
Take it easy on his old ass. You're gonna
kill him before I get a chance to.

756
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:30,164
<i>He'll die a lucky man.</i>

757
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:32,789
In position.

758
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:37,754
- Let's take this fucker out.
<i>- Yes, ma'am.</i>

759
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,461
<i>Take it away, Sindy.</i>

760
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:53,389
It's blow time, mister.

761
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,112
Ready?

762
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,980
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- Here we go.

763
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:01,397
Consider yourself retired, motherfucker.

764
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,360
<i>All yours, Facundo.</i>

765
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:11,953
Bang.

766
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,424
Fuck!

767
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,417
Fuck!

768
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:24,051
<i>Sindy, talk to me.</i>

769
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:26,303
By the bed, southwest corner!

770
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,274
- Where the hell is he?
- Under the bed!

771
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,272
Center.

772
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:53,293
Fuck! I can't see him, can't see Sindy,
can't see shit.

773
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:54,663
Shit.

774
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,634
<i>- Moving in.
- Breaching now.</i>

775
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:04,548
Fuck!

776
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:07,255
<i>"Fuck" what?</i>

777
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,259
<i>What's happening?</i>

778
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:12,642
He's not here.

779
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:14,808
Facundo?

780
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,101
- Find him.
<i>- I'm on it.</i>

781
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:22,864
I got nothin'.

782
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:28,871
Fuck!

783
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:32,333
<i>What the fuck was that?</i>

784
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:33,410
Facundo?

785
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:34,953
<i>You there?</i>

786
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:38,915
<i>Facundo?</i>

787
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,000
Facundo, what the hell is going on?

788
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,085
Did you hear that?

789
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:03,727
Fuck!

790
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:16,749
Try not to be scared.

791
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:18,408
<i>Scared of what?</i>

792
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,709
You make mistakes when you're afraid.

793
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:26,795
<i>No mistakes. Not today.</i>

794
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:34,929
Alexei, activate plan B.

795
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:38,636
I'm going to kill you.

796
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:40,647
<i>Why?</i>

797
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:44,232
Because that's what
I get paid to do, Duncan.

798
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:45,895
<i>Who is paying you?</i>

799
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:49,111
Does it fucking matter?

800
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:51,605
<i>You'll be dead
before we leave here.</i>

801
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:55,239
<i>Well, in that case, I guess
I wouldn't want you to leave, then.</i>

802
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:56,793
<i>Yeah?</i>

803
01:05:56,869 --> 01:05:59,369
<i>You can't always get what you want,
old man.</i>

804
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:00,705
<i>Goodbye.</i>

805
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,385
- I need a name.
- Fuck you, you cunt!

806
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:20,426
A different name.

807
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:23,765
Name.

808
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:25,984
- No fuckin' names.
- Right.

809
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,065
You know what this...

810
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:34,702
Did you hear that?

811
01:06:58,097 --> 01:06:59,427
Try not to be scared.

812
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:14,472
Alexei?

813
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:16,049
Did you get the girl?

814
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:22,809
What girl?

815
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:24,851
Who the fuck are you?

816
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,442
- What the fuck's going on, man?
- You tell me.

817
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:29,521
What's going on?

818
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:31,769
Alexei got a call.

819
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:34,441
We was told to go
and fetch the girl and shit.

820
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:36,279
What girl?

821
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:38,775
The girl the old man bought a gift for.

822
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:40,948
What the fuck do I know?

823
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:50,024
Don't be sad.
You'll find a new girlfriend.

824
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,896
Shouldn't be a problem
with your hot looks.

825
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:58,402
I'm gonna cut him into pieces
and feed him to the rats!

826
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:03,201
I told you not to fuck with him.

827
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:06,332
I'm gonna chop his balls off
and shove them down his throat!

828
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:11,460
What you should do
is pay Duncan his fuckin' pension

829
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:13,496
and enjoy the rest of your life.

830
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:14,844
No!

831
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:18,876
This is personal.

832
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:21,881
Stealing his pension,

833
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,351
trying to kill him, twice,

834
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:26,258
and kidnapping his cute little neighbor,

835
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:28,097
<i>that </i>is personal.

836
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:29,812
I want him.

837
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:32,693
I'm sick of giving you advice.

838
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,100
I'm not asking for advice!

839
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:36,975
I'm givingyou a fucking order!

840
01:10:41,528 --> 01:10:43,158
- Are you done?
- No!

841
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:32,370
To hell with you guys.

842
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:35,124
<i>Give it up for our own
king of the road, Porter.</i>

843
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:36,996
<i>Next up, Larry.</i>

844
01:11:38,752 --> 01:11:40,002
What are you drinking?

845
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,173
I don't have time, Porter.

846
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:45,546
Oh, you got time to have a drink
with a dying man.

847
01:11:46,176 --> 01:11:49,096
One for me
and one for my friend here.

848
01:11:52,599 --> 01:11:53,599
Cheers.

849
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:01,399
So.

850
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,280
They did try to kill you.

851
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:05,194
Twice.

852
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:09,028
Once in Belarus and once at my place.

853
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:13,868
You know,
I had the worst winter of my life...

854
01:12:14,955 --> 01:12:16,285
one summer in Belarus.

855
01:12:16,373 --> 01:12:17,963
What's going on, Porter?

856
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:20,462
We're getting too old.

857
01:12:21,545 --> 01:12:23,045
And that's what's going on.

858
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:30,468
Somewhere in your contract
is a bunch of words

859
01:12:30,554 --> 01:12:33,314
that says if you die before retirement,

860
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,943
all the money goes back to the company,

861
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:39,559
unless you've named a next of kin,

862
01:12:39,646 --> 01:12:42,106
and who in our business

863
01:12:43,108 --> 01:12:45,738
has a next of kin?

864
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:48,362
And you are costing the company...

865
01:12:49,406 --> 01:12:51,366
a shitload of money.

866
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,078
How much they owe you? Three?

867
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:55,995
Four?

868
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:57,957
Eight.

869
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:01,746
You trust Vivian?

870
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:03,301
No.

871
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:04,379
D'you fuck her?

872
01:13:06,673 --> 01:13:07,673
I did. Ugh.

873
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:13,807
Okay. Do you know
where they would keep the girl?

874
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:20,271
Your guess is as good as mine,
but, uh, she's probably in the mansion.

875
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:22,024
It's got lots of rooms.

876
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:25,688
Enough for all of his perverted stunts.

877
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:27,646
I've only been in that building once.

878
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:32,992
I had to shake
that disgusting creature's hand.

879
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:34,624
Thanks, Porter.

880
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:36,911
And I... I want to tell you something.

881
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:41,668
You were just too good, you know.

882
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:43,289
Is that it?

883
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:46,714
Take it for what it's worth.

884
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:49,473
Be careful, Duncan.

885
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:05,227
And down he goes.

886
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:07,479
Fuckin' drunk.

887
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:10,566
<i>Speak.</i>

888
01:14:10,654 --> 01:14:11,824
It's done.

889
01:14:11,905 --> 01:14:13,195
<i>Well done, Porter.</i>

890
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:16,162
Send someone over, clean this place up.

891
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:17,827
<i>You got it.</i>

892
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:07,877
You hurt me, Mr. Vizla.

893
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:15,219
And that cannot be repaid
with a swift, impersonal death.

894
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:30,441
Hmm.

895
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:35,487
When the English caught
the traitor William Wallace...

896
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:40,122
they dragged him naked
through the streets for six miles

897
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:45,712
so that peasants could smear
their warm, fresh piss and shit on him.

898
01:15:47,584 --> 01:15:52,464
Then the executioner cut off
his cock and balls,

899
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:55,545
cooked them over a fire,

900
01:15:55,842 --> 01:15:57,892
and then served them for him to eat.

901
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:03,144
He slit his guts right open, huh,
and pulled them out.

902
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:07,852
He could literally see and smell
his own intestines.

903
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:11,065
And so it went on,

904
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:15,113
because the traitor had hurt the king.

905
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:20,911
I guess Wallace hurt England pretty bad.

906
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:28,666
You hurt me pretty bad, Mr. Vizla.

907
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:34,881
I have four days
before I have to kill you.

908
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:39,218
Four days of hell!

909
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:41,886
And on your birthday...

910
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,140
you die.

911
01:17:00,824 --> 01:17:02,584
I'm gonna have a little fun...

912
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:05,082
with your lady.

913
01:17:05,662 --> 01:17:06,872
And you're gonna watch.

914
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:15,509
So I've given it some thought,

915
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:19,379
and I've decided
that we're gonna start...

916
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:22,094
with these.

917
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:24,006
Huh?

918
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:26,927
Music, please.

919
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:36,692
Fuck!

920
01:17:43,533 --> 01:17:45,013
Sorry, did that hurt?

921
01:17:50,707 --> 01:17:53,667
The fun continues tomorrow,
Mr. Vizla.

922
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:06,810
There you go, honey.

923
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:30,409
Music, please.

924
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:47,805
Hah!

925
01:18:49,099 --> 01:18:51,889
The fun continues tomorrow, Mr. Vizla.

926
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:24,344
Well, I can't just do one side
and not the other.

927
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:29,886
Easy now, honey.

928
01:19:41,401 --> 01:19:43,281
You broke my favorite knife.

929
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,365
I said, you've broken my favorite...

930
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:50,407
Hello?

931
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:52,036
Hello?

932
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:59,587
I'm obviously not getting through to you,
am I?

933
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:14,768
The fun continues tomorrow, Mr. Vizla.

934
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:42,843
<i>Wake up...</i>

935
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:56,288
What the fuck?

936
01:23:34,926 --> 01:23:37,136
Well, don't just stand there. Kill him!

937
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:53,360
Oh, shit!

938
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:56,607
Fuck!

939
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:02,292
Go, go, go!

940
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:20,175
He's coming. Get him!

941
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:45,351
Who the fuck are you?

942
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:47,466
No. I need your phone, Jazmin.

943
01:27:48,471 --> 01:27:49,561
Duncan?

944
01:27:49,639 --> 01:27:50,809
- Is that you?
- Phone.

945
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:54,105
- Jesus. What the fuck happened to you?
- Phone!

946
01:27:54,143 --> 01:27:55,563
Here, here, take the phone.

947
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:07,237
Quiet.
Try and keep him on the line.

948
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:11,041
Speak.

949
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:12,746
I'll make you a trade.

950
01:28:14,038 --> 01:28:15,158
Me for the girl.

951
01:28:17,083 --> 01:28:19,503
You hear? You hear me?

952
01:28:19,919 --> 01:28:21,049
I heard you.

953
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:22,339
I'll call you back.

954
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:26,125
Whoa. I got you.

955
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:30,722
- Please, tell me you got him.
- No, no luck. Not long enough.

956
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:32,515
We have to keep him on the line longer.

957
01:28:32,598 --> 01:28:33,958
What did he say? He wants a trade.

958
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:36,847
A trade?

959
01:28:36,936 --> 01:28:39,436
- His life for the girl's.
- The girl?

960
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:43,322
- Is she even worth it?
- Not when I'm done with her.

961
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:45,265
Because when I'm done with them,

962
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:48,073
they're both going to be fucking dead!

963
01:28:54,704 --> 01:28:55,914
How many men do you have left?

964
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,333
Enough.

965
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:17,080
Up, up, up. Let's go.

966
01:30:17,328 --> 01:30:18,368
Up.

967
01:30:20,998 --> 01:30:23,748
You're not going anywhere soon
with all that shit in your system.

968
01:30:27,713 --> 01:30:29,473
Hey, stop, stop, stop.

969
01:30:33,052 --> 01:30:34,102
This should help.

970
01:30:36,389 --> 01:30:37,389
Okay, just lie down.

971
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:41,600
There you go.

972
01:30:42,854 --> 01:30:43,864
Yeah.

973
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:58,163
Okay, Duncan.
How can I help you? What do you need?

974
01:30:58,244 --> 01:30:59,244
An army.

975
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:03,038
Okay, here we go. You'll need all of it.

976
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:05,754
- It's like a full package.
- Okay.

977
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:07,958
Here, try these on.

978
01:31:30,276 --> 01:31:32,276
I always knew you'd come back.

979
01:31:32,862 --> 01:31:35,662
I was just hoping it'd be for me,
not the guns.

980
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:57,394
Okay, ready.

981
01:31:58,679 --> 01:31:59,719
Be quiet!

982
01:32:00,598 --> 01:32:01,428
Speak.

983
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:02,556
Is she alive?

984
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:03,642
Yes.

985
01:32:03,893 --> 01:32:05,193
She'll be ready, Duncan.

986
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:06,645
Stand by.

987
01:32:07,438 --> 01:32:09,688
- Did we trace that?
- We're working on it.

988
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:12,154
We have his general vicinity,
but we need another call.

989
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:14,738
Let's get on the move.

990
01:32:15,947 --> 01:32:17,027
I'm on it. He'll call back.

991
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:21,011
- You'd better be right.
- I'm always right.

992
01:32:21,035 --> 01:32:22,445
Let's go!

993
01:33:28,769 --> 01:33:29,769
Speak.

994
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:32,318
- <i>What's the deal?</i>
- Me for the girl.

995
01:33:32,815 --> 01:33:35,435
- <i>An even trade.</i>
- I know. You already said that.

996
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:38,569
Where and when?

997
01:33:38,654 --> 01:33:41,414
Central Train Station, nine a.m. tomorrow.

998
01:33:41,866 --> 01:33:43,866
Why the fuck are you doing this?

999
01:33:43,951 --> 01:33:45,831
I don't know. I like her.

1000
01:33:46,412 --> 01:33:47,502
<i>You like her?</i>

1001
01:33:48,497 --> 01:33:49,827
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

1002
01:33:49,915 --> 01:33:50,955
Please.

1003
01:33:51,042 --> 01:33:52,882
This is our fucking job, remember?

1004
01:33:54,128 --> 01:33:56,838
You used to have one and be good at it.

1005
01:33:58,090 --> 01:33:59,210
<i>Nine a.m. tomorrow.</i>

1006
01:33:59,675 --> 01:34:01,475
You, me, and Camille.
<i>That's it. No one else.</i>

1007
01:34:02,928 --> 01:34:05,678
Jesus! It has a name.
And you remembered it.

1008
01:34:06,265 --> 01:34:09,685
And you have a face I won't forget.
You better not pull a fast one tomorrow.

1009
01:34:11,687 --> 01:34:14,017
<i>Unless you want to hide
for the rest of your life, Vivian.</i>

1010
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:18,857
I'm afraid it's a bit too late
for that now.

1011
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:25,076
<i>And to think, you've been
hiding out just around the corner.</i>

1012
01:34:31,123 --> 01:34:32,253
<i>Here we are.</i>

1013
01:34:35,711 --> 01:34:37,051
<i>Happy to see me?</i>

1014
01:34:37,129 --> 01:34:38,339
<i>Not really.</i>

1015
01:34:41,008 --> 01:34:44,208
I like the eye patch. Very fancy.
And you look extraordinary, as always.

1016
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:56,024
Time to die, Herr Black Kaiser.

1017
01:34:56,107 --> 01:34:57,777
Nowhere to run this time.

1018
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:01,613
- Thought you stopped smoking.
- Yeah.

1019
01:35:02,905 --> 01:35:04,315
Figured it wouldn't kill me.

1020
01:35:05,616 --> 01:35:06,616
Hm.

1021
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:11,000
Was I on the phone too long?

1022
01:35:11,789 --> 01:35:12,999
Forty-seven seconds.

1023
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:15,753
Guess we do get rusty when we turn 50.

1024
01:35:16,293 --> 01:35:18,093
Yeah, it's sad.

1025
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:20,421
I know they pay you well for this, Vivian.

1026
01:35:21,757 --> 01:35:24,547
But I'm still gonna give you a chance
to walk out of here alive.

1027
01:35:25,594 --> 01:35:26,684
For old times' sake.

1028
01:35:28,264 --> 01:35:29,854
You've become sentimental.

1029
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:33,354
Me for the girl. An even trade.

1030
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:38,400
You keep saying that,
but you don't have anything to trade with.

1031
01:35:38,816 --> 01:35:40,146
You are at a dead end.

1032
01:35:41,110 --> 01:35:44,280
The road that you have chosen
doesn't have a rainbow.

1033
01:35:45,448 --> 01:35:46,448
No.

1034
01:35:47,575 --> 01:35:48,575
No rainbows.

1035
01:35:51,495 --> 01:35:52,995
You grew soft, Duncan.

1036
01:35:54,957 --> 01:35:55,957
Your bad.

1037
01:36:45,299 --> 01:36:48,719
Oh, shit!

1038
01:37:06,737 --> 01:37:08,777
Shit!

1039
01:37:17,915 --> 01:37:19,075
Duncan...

1040
01:37:20,125 --> 01:37:21,125
Duncan...

1041
01:37:27,383 --> 01:37:28,383
Guards?

1042
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:35,890
Guards!

1043
01:37:51,156 --> 01:37:52,276
You know what? Let him come.

1044
01:37:55,035 --> 01:37:56,615
I'm gonna fuck him up.

1045
01:37:56,704 --> 01:37:58,794
Yeah.

1046
01:37:58,914 --> 01:38:00,424
I'm gonna fuck him up!

1047
01:38:00,499 --> 01:38:02,749
Yes, come here, you fucking fuck!

1048
01:38:02,835 --> 01:38:03,835
Mr. Blut?

1049
01:38:04,336 --> 01:38:05,376
Look.

1050
01:38:11,844 --> 01:38:13,394
Oh, shit.

1051
01:38:25,608 --> 01:38:27,128
Let's get the fuck outta here!

1052
01:38:27,526 --> 01:38:29,146
Go, go, go! Move!

1053
01:38:29,737 --> 01:38:30,737
Don't you fucking dare!

1054
01:38:30,946 --> 01:38:32,566
Hey, you fucking pussies!

1055
01:38:36,535 --> 01:38:37,535
Oh, dear! Come back!

1056
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:48,514
- Excuse us.
- He's upstairs.

1057
01:38:56,889 --> 01:38:58,099
Go, go, go! Move!

1058
01:39:05,564 --> 01:39:06,734
Hello, there.

1059
01:39:06,857 --> 01:39:08,277
Is Mr. Blut expecting you, sir?

1060
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:12,775
I'll fetch you a cup of coffee, sir.

1061
01:39:13,489 --> 01:39:15,369
- Bring me the girl.
<i>- No.</i>

1062
01:39:15,407 --> 01:39:16,737
Bring me the fucking girl!

1063
01:39:16,825 --> 01:39:18,365
<i>No fuckin' way. You're on your own.</i>

1064
01:39:18,452 --> 01:39:20,582
What do you mean you won't... Hello?

1065
01:39:20,663 --> 01:39:21,663
Hello?

1066
01:40:04,373 --> 01:40:05,623
Done already, sir?

1067
01:40:06,125 --> 01:40:07,125
Yes.

1068
01:40:07,376 --> 01:40:08,376
Oh.

1069
01:40:09,253 --> 01:40:10,253
Mr. Blut?

1070
01:40:10,963 --> 01:40:11,963
Oh, dear.

1071
01:42:33,355 --> 01:42:34,685
<i>I always wonder...</i>

1072
01:42:34,773 --> 01:42:36,533
<i>...be to find him.</i>

1073
01:42:38,235 --> 01:42:40,105
<i>...and tell him what he did.</i>

1074
01:42:42,072 --> 01:42:44,322
<i>Do you think it would be difficult
to kill someone?</i>

1075
01:42:44,449 --> 01:42:47,239
<i>Will you be making
the same charity donation?</i>

1076
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:04,390
<i>I can see you.</i>

1077
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:21,200
I only see you.

1078
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:31,539
You are always the only one I see.

1079
01:43:36,251 --> 01:43:38,051
Sit down.

1080
01:43:46,136 --> 01:43:48,466
Everyone else is there
when I close my eyes.

1081
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:51,677
But I can't see them.

1082
01:43:53,185 --> 01:43:54,265
I can feel them.

1083
01:43:56,021 --> 01:43:58,321
I feel my brother's soft cheek
on my shoulder.

1084
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:00,233
His hair...

1085
01:44:00,734 --> 01:44:02,654
His hair smelled of little boy.

1086
01:44:02,736 --> 01:44:04,066
I loved him.

1087
01:44:06,281 --> 01:44:09,661
I can feel my mother's warm hand
wrapped around mine.

1088
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:12,245
Always warm.

1089
01:44:13,288 --> 01:44:17,248
All of her is warm because she's
about to have my baby sister.

1090
01:44:20,462 --> 01:44:22,922
I can smell the cigarette
my father just put out.

1091
01:44:24,299 --> 01:44:26,299
He smelled of cigarettes and aftershave.

1092
01:44:27,094 --> 01:44:28,104
I liked it a lot.

1093
01:44:30,472 --> 01:44:31,932
I can feel them.

1094
01:44:32,349 --> 01:44:33,679
But I can't see them.

1095
01:44:35,686 --> 01:44:36,686
Only you.

1096
01:44:38,897 --> 01:44:40,267
Always you.

1097
01:44:42,567 --> 01:44:43,567
Why?

1098
01:44:44,903 --> 01:44:46,533
Why didn't you just shoot me?

1099
01:44:49,825 --> 01:44:51,325
It was not supposed to happen.

1100
01:44:52,327 --> 01:44:53,327
It was a mistake.

1101
01:44:56,456 --> 01:44:58,666
- I was given the wrong information...
- Don't talk.

1102
01:44:59,334 --> 01:45:01,804
Just... don't talk.

1103
01:45:05,716 --> 01:45:10,096
Every day,
I pray that I'd died that night.

1104
01:45:11,972 --> 01:45:13,352
Do you understand?

1105
01:45:16,768 --> 01:45:19,188
No, do you understand?

1106
01:45:22,524 --> 01:45:23,734
I'm sorry.

1107
01:45:27,237 --> 01:45:29,817
Yeah, I didn't learn about it
until I turned 21.

1108
01:45:31,366 --> 01:45:33,036
Someone paid for my school.

1109
01:45:34,077 --> 01:45:36,997
Someone was asking for salvation.

1110
01:45:38,582 --> 01:45:41,382
I thought, "Follow the money,"
as they say.

1111
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:44,456
It wasn't as hard as I thought.

1112
01:45:45,672 --> 01:45:47,342
It just took me a while to go there.

1113
01:45:49,051 --> 01:45:50,261
Too afraid, I guess.

1114
01:45:52,679 --> 01:45:54,809
I thought that if I saw you,

1115
01:45:55,474 --> 01:45:58,814
I might get my family back
when I closed my eyes.

1116
01:46:00,228 --> 01:46:01,518
But that didn't happen.

1117
01:46:02,522 --> 01:46:04,402
I didn't move on.

1118
01:46:06,318 --> 01:46:07,488
I can't!

1119
01:46:10,739 --> 01:46:12,319
Do you understand?

1120
01:46:14,618 --> 01:46:15,618
Yeah.

1121
01:46:16,328 --> 01:46:19,288
You didn't recognize me
when we met at the store?

1122
01:46:20,457 --> 01:46:21,957
You know, the first time we met?

1123
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:24,917
Were you not curious?

1124
01:46:26,046 --> 01:46:30,256
You paid all this money and you didn't
even know what I looked like?

1125
01:46:31,134 --> 01:46:32,304
Who I was?

1126
01:46:37,182 --> 01:46:38,812
I didn't want to disturb you.

1127
01:46:40,602 --> 01:46:42,152
Interfere with your life.

1128
01:46:43,355 --> 01:46:47,025
Well, but you have... interfered.

1129
01:46:50,695 --> 01:46:52,315
I don't want to see you anymore.

1130
01:46:52,948 --> 01:46:55,948
I want you to go away.

1131
01:46:56,868 --> 01:46:58,538
And I want them to come back.

1132
01:47:00,038 --> 01:47:01,038
Understand?

1133
01:47:08,630 --> 01:47:09,630
Close your mind...

1134
01:47:11,049 --> 01:47:12,179
and pull the trigger.

1135
01:47:17,472 --> 01:47:18,472
It's okay.

1136
01:47:47,085 --> 01:47:49,045
Do you know who wanted my father dead?

1137
01:47:52,549 --> 01:47:53,549
No.

1138
01:47:55,635 --> 01:47:56,885
Well, can we find out?

1139
01:48:00,182 --> 01:48:01,222
We can try.

1139
01:48:02,305 --> 01:49:02,765

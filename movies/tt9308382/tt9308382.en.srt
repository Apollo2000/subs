00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,166
Okay, now, guys,
I'm not going back to Hawaii.

162
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,636
If we're gonna do tropical,
Jack,

163
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:09,271
I want to go to the Maldives.

164
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:13,942
Jack, there hasn't been a new
Grace Davis record in a decade,

165
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:15,944
and the fans want one.

166
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:17,312
- (sighing): Okay.
- We need one.

167
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:20,115
Let me tell you something...
I've been managing Grace

168
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:22,418
longer than you've
probably been alive.

169
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:24,721
So you think
she should do new material?

170
00:07:24,754 --> 00:07:27,022
- Yeah.
- Okay. Guess what.

171
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:29,726
Don't nobody give a shit
about new material.

172
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,093
- Okay?
- (scoffs)

173
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:32,729
That last album she did,

174
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:36,098
it didn't do as well
as she had hoped.

175
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:39,535
Matter of fact, those was not
Grace Davis numbers,

176
00:07:39,568 --> 00:07:41,069
and you know it.

177
00:07:41,103 --> 00:07:42,471
That was a reality check,

178
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,340
people letting us know
it's time to move on.

179
00:07:45,374 --> 00:07:47,543
- To a Vegas residency?
- Yeah.

180
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:49,478
Don't nobody want to go
to no Yankee Doodle

181
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,714
Springsteen concert
and hear him play

182
00:07:51,748 --> 00:07:53,683
that <i>Wrecking Ball</i>
folksy bullshit.

183
00:07:53,716 --> 00:07:56,151
Actually, that was
an incredibly poignant album,

184
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:57,986
and it did extremely well.

185
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,123
People want
"Thunder Road," okay?

186
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:02,725
And that's what
we gonna give 'em.

187
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,127
We gonna give 'em
"Thunder Road."

188
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,062
That's how I pay my mortgage.

189
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:08,063
But you wouldn't know that,

190
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:09,264
'cause your little ass
ain't got no mortgage.

191
00:08:09,298 --> 00:08:12,702
Crazy little girl gonna tell me
how to do my goddamn job.

No, I don't want

- Dark shorty.

318
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:21,944
- I call Mr. Chocolate.
- JACK: Grace!

319
00:13:21,978 --> 00:13:23,545
- Yes, Jack.
- Look. Hey.

320
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:24,914
Hey, y'all.
Get the hell out of here.

321
00:13:24,947 --> 00:13:26,649
- Beat it. Beat it.
- Oh, and hello to you, too.

322
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:28,718
- Give me that.
- Oh, give me that.

323
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:30,920
- Remember Alec? Caesars Palace?
- Oh.

324
00:13:30,953 --> 00:13:32,387
Of course I do.

325
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,523
I wish I'd known
you were coming. I...

326
00:13:34,556 --> 00:13:36,458
I would've gotten you box seats.

327
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:38,628
Oh, there's no need to fret.
Jack got me...

328
00:13:38,661 --> 00:13:40,562
- (mimicking Jack): the hookup.
- Ah!

329
00:13:40,595 --> 00:13:41,931
ALEC:
I can't tell you how stoked I am

330
00:13:41,964 --> 00:13:43,866
to be here and finally
be having this conversation.

331
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,068
We so want to be
in the you business, Grace.

332
00:13:46,102 --> 00:13:48,336
Caesars is going through
a full revamp.

333
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,539
Uh, more seats,
brighter lights, louder sound.

334
00:13:50,572 --> 00:13:51,941
JACK:
It looked great in there.

335
00:13:51,974 --> 00:13:54,376
It's hooked. And everything
you're doing on tour,

336
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:55,678
- we can do it right there.
- Yeah.

337
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:57,445
JACK:
Five years, six years.

338
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:59,749
- Ten.
- Ten.

339
00:13:59,782 --> 00:14:01,617
I would do the same thing
every night?

340
00:14:01,651 --> 00:14:03,686
(laughing):
Man, that's my dream job.

341
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,655
- Easy money. Look, no stress.
- Mm-hmm.

342
00:14:05,688 --> 00:14:06,956
All right? No more touring.

343
00:14:06,989 --> 00:14:08,691
(whispers):
I love touring.

344
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:10,425
- I like groupies, too.
- (chuckles)

345
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,694
No, I like touring.
I don't like groupies.

346
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:13,696
But this way...
this way, I ain't got to

347
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:16,732
(chuckling):
reinvent your ass every time.

348
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:19,101
I'm just trying to take
a little pressure off myself.

349
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,969
MAGGIE:
I found your lucky glass.

350
00:14:20,002 --> 00:14:21,871
It was on the balcony,
which was weird.

351
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,973
- Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't...
- ALEC: Sweetheart, be an angel.

352
00:14:24,006 --> 00:14:26,575
- Get me a drink. No soda. Ugh.
- Get, get, get, get.

353
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:28,711
Celine Dion did over
a thousand shows for us.

354
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:31,848
But I think, with your fan base,
we can beat that record.

355
00:14:31,881 --> 00:14:34,416
(scoffs) Man, come on.

356
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:35,718
(mimicking Jack):
Man, come on.

357
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:37,485
- JACK: That's nothing.
- ALEC: That's nothing.

358
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,788
It's "nathan."

359
00:14:38,821 --> 00:14:40,455
It's... "nathan."

360
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:42,591
If you want the feel
of touring, we can do it.

361
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,060
We'll leave from Vegas,
we'll drive you around,

362
00:14:44,093 --> 00:14:45,127
we'll come back to Vegas.

363
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:46,128
You'll feel like you're touring.

364
00:14:46,162 --> 00:14:47,163
We'll do whatever you want.

365
00:14:47,196 --> 00:14:48,865
Grace, there's a problem
with the house monitor,

366
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:50,900
so we just need to do
another sound check.

367
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,034
Oh, my God. Okay.

368
00:14:52,068 --> 00:14:53,169
- So sorry. Duty calls.
- Oh.

369
00:14:53,202 --> 00:14:54,604
- Got to go.
- Of course. Yeah.

370
00:14:54,637 --> 00:14:55,872
We'll do anything
to get you there.

371
00:14:55,905 --> 00:14:57,472
- So, uh...
- Thank you for coming.

372
00:14:57,505 --> 00:14:58,941
Enjoy the show.

Yeah. I can't sleep.

Such a good song.

Maxine Brown.

393
00:15:47,223 --> 00:15:48,891
You know who originally
wrote this?

394
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:50,960
- Yeah. Carole King.
- Very good.

395
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:53,595
- She's my favorite songwriter.
- Really?

396
00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:55,665
- Other than you.
- Thank you.

397
00:15:55,698 --> 00:15:57,133
- I'm sorry.
- (laughing)

398
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,935
- I'm joking.
- Mm.

399
00:15:58,968 --> 00:16:00,502
Here.

400
00:16:01,804 --> 00:16:04,807
That was a really good move
back there with Mr. Vegas.

401
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,475
(exhales through lips)
It did not look like

402
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,211
you wanted to have
that conversation.

403
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:10,545
Oh.

404
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:12,615
Like you can read me so well.

405
00:16:13,282 --> 00:16:14,482
Sorry.

406
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:15,685
I'm kidding.

407
00:16:15,718 --> 00:16:17,485
I can't believe he pulled that.

408
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,689
He's just looking out for me.

409
00:16:19,722 --> 00:16:24,160
He and I have been hustling
together since I was...

410
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:25,995
since I was 18.

411
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:30,166
I used to do these sets
at these late-night,

412
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:32,134
divey piano bars.

413
00:16:32,168 --> 00:16:36,205
They were, like, sticky floors,
like, smoke everywhere.

414
00:16:36,238 --> 00:16:38,540
Sound system was terrible.

415
00:16:38,573 --> 00:16:40,676
They were awful.
Like, awful.

416
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,979
And every night, Jack would...
(chuckles)

417
00:16:43,012 --> 00:16:47,149
He would show up, and he'd be
standing in the back...

418
00:16:47,183 --> 00:16:51,120
and his mouth was just, like,
hanging open, looking at me.

419
00:16:51,153 --> 00:16:52,221
(chuckles)

420
00:16:52,254 --> 00:16:54,924
For where we come from,

421
00:16:54,957 --> 00:16:59,095
getting locked into
a Vegas residency,

422
00:16:59,128 --> 00:17:02,264
that is a win.

423
00:17:02,298 --> 00:17:04,900
What?

424
00:17:04,934 --> 00:17:07,269
Nothing.

425
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:11,040
I know everyone
is happy with me...

426
00:17:13,676 --> 00:17:16,645
...doing the same show
every night.

427
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:19,749
I don't know, what if...

428
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,852
Whatever.

429
00:17:22,885 --> 00:17:24,820
I remember watching you
on <i>Oprah...</i>

430
00:17:24,854 --> 00:17:27,023
- Which time?
- ...when I was little, and...

431
00:17:27,056 --> 00:17:28,590
I've done <i>Oprah</i> so many times.

432
00:17:28,624 --> 00:17:30,893
I think you were talking
about your third album.

433
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:31,961
Uh-huh.

434
00:17:31,994 --> 00:17:35,664
And you said this thing
that I'll never forget.

435
00:17:35,698 --> 00:17:37,099
I think about it all the time.

436
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:40,269
You said, "When there are
no more surprises,

437
00:17:40,302 --> 00:17:42,738
then who am I doing it for?"

438
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:47,209
- Oprah.
- (quietly): Oprah.

439
00:17:47,243 --> 00:17:49,577
- Long time ago.
- (chuckles)

440
00:17:49,612 --> 00:17:51,781
So, has this just been,
like, a long con?

441
00:17:51,814 --> 00:17:54,183
Yes. Ever since
I was a little girl,

442
00:17:54,216 --> 00:17:58,020
I've dreamed of giving you
an enema in Toronto.

443
00:17:58,054 --> 00:17:58,888
Okay.

444
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:00,856
- Do not bring up Toronto.
- (chuckling)

445
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,059
You know what clams do to me.

MAGGIE:
She was telling me about

448
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:11,267
all these amazing affairs
that she had. It...

449
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,803
KATIE: So you didn't talk
to her about the album.

450
00:18:13,836 --> 00:18:15,304
MAGGIE: No.
You don't understand. Katie...

451
00:18:15,337 --> 00:18:18,074
BOTH: She doesn't have
any family, and no friends.

452
00:18:18,107 --> 00:18:19,675
You're not friends.
We are friends.

453
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,177
You know how I know
we're friends?

454
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,081
Because friends don't pay
friends to be their friends.

455
00:18:26,248 --> 00:18:29,085
I actually feel like I pay
for a lot of stuff

456
00:18:29,118 --> 00:18:31,387
- in this relationship.
- This is like a trap, you know?

457
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:35,024
- No.
- You are not the only person in the world for her.

458
00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:37,093
You are my only person
in my world.

459
00:18:37,126 --> 00:18:39,895
(chuckles) I know that,
but if you told 12-year-old me

460
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:42,098
that one day I'd be working
for Grace Davis...

461
00:18:42,131 --> 00:18:43,632
I mean, she's an icon.

462
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,000
- It's the dream job.
- (phone chimes)

463
00:18:45,034 --> 00:18:46,669
Or at least it's,
like, the gateway

464
00:18:46,702 --> 00:18:48,070
to my actual dream job, but...

465
00:18:48,104 --> 00:18:50,139
It's the gateway to, like,
Stockholm syndrome.

466
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:53,242
Hey, I thought you left
your phone in the car.

467
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:55,311
Yeah, my...
I left my phone in the car.

468
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:56,278
This is my work phone.

469
00:18:56,312 --> 00:18:58,047
Okay. You know what?
Listen to me, Maggie.

470
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,815
- Yes.
- Phone down. Eyes on me.

471
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:01,383
I know you think
that she's gonna

472
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:02,451
give you this, like,
life-changing shot

473
00:19:02,485 --> 00:19:05,354
and you guys are gonna ride off
into the sunset

474
00:19:05,387 --> 00:19:06,956
holding hands or some shit,

475
00:19:06,989 --> 00:19:10,025
but I think we need to
consider the possibility

476
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:12,795
that this woman doesn't even
know your last name.

477
00:19:12,828 --> 00:19:14,730
- She does, sometimes.
- Do we really think

478
00:19:14,763 --> 00:19:15,998
she's gonna stop making you

479
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:18,067
wear her shoes around the house
to break them in

480
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,137
and, oh, I don't know,
make you her producer?

481
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,972
- Yes!
- Maggie!

482
00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:24,740
- (scoffs)
- She only did that once, by the way,

483
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:25,975
and it was for the Grammys.

484
00:19:26,008 --> 00:19:27,710
Can you please want more
for yourself?

485
00:19:27,743 --> 00:19:30,279
We are like this.

486
00:19:30,312 --> 00:19:31,747
So, when you say "affairs"...

487
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,982
MAGGIE:
I'm not gonna tell you anything.

488
00:19:33,015 --> 00:19:34,450
KATIE:
Like, give me a name. One name.

489
00:19:34,483 --> 00:19:35,818
MAGGIE:
Because Grace and I are friends

490
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:37,086

if your distaste for the show

516
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:39,048
is affecting your ability
to appreciate

517
00:20:39,081 --> 00:20:41,884
the musical complexity
of the song.

518
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:43,252
(clears throat)
Um...

519
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:46,488
Well, of all the songs
about California,

520
00:20:46,522 --> 00:20:48,157
this is not the one
that I would pick.

521
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,359
- Okay.
- Joni Mitchell's "California," maybe.

522
00:20:50,392 --> 00:20:52,962
Or "Going Back to Cali"
or "California Dreamin'."

523
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:54,496
They're all way better
than this.

524
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,498
- "California Love."
- Yeah.

525
00:20:56,532 --> 00:20:58,400
Zeppelin's
"Going to California."

526
00:20:58,434 --> 00:21:00,269
- That's an amazing song.
- Okay.

527
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:01,537
"Hotel California."

528
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,772
Mm, uh...

529
00:21:03,806 --> 00:21:05,174
What's wrong with
"Hotel California"?

530
00:21:05,207 --> 00:21:07,810
Well, the Eagles are hokey,
and Don Henley is

531
00:21:07,843 --> 00:21:08,944
a very mean man.

532
00:21:08,978 --> 00:21:11,780
- Okay.
- Randy Meisner almost died of a stomach ulcer

533
00:21:11,814 --> 00:21:13,849
because the band
hated each other so much.

534
00:21:13,882 --> 00:21:15,050
Yeah, but it's a perfect song.

535
00:21:15,084 --> 00:21:16,418
It's, like, underrated,
to be honest.

536
00:21:16,452 --> 00:21:17,219
Underrated?

537
00:21:17,253 --> 00:21:19,321
- Yeah.
- It's literally always on.

538
00:21:19,355 --> 00:21:21,056
- (scoffs) Okay.
- It's, like, the "Brown Eyed Girl"

539
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,858
of Southern California
soft rock.

540
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:25,194
So the Eagles won't make
your fantasy dinner party.

541
00:21:25,227 --> 00:21:26,228
Who does?

542
00:21:26,262 --> 00:21:27,396
Popsicle?

543
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:28,797
Oh, no, thanks.

544
00:21:28,831 --> 00:21:31,567
Well, uh, living or dead?

545
00:21:31,601 --> 00:21:33,869
It doesn't matter.

546
00:21:33,902 --> 00:21:35,537
Um, Brian Wilson.

547
00:21:35,571 --> 00:21:37,139
Mm-hmm.

548
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:37,940
Nina Simone.

549
00:21:37,973 --> 00:21:40,309
She and I have
the same birthday.

550
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:41,377
Me and Mariah Carey.

551
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,913
So we're both very demanding
and very deeply sad.

552
00:21:44,947 --> 00:21:47,583
- Yeah.
- (laughs)

553
00:21:47,617 --> 00:21:48,652
- Otis Redding, for sure.
- Oh, you're not

554
00:21:48,685 --> 00:21:50,419
one of those girls
who learned about Otis Redding

555
00:21:50,452 --> 00:21:52,021
from the <i>Dirty Dancing</i>
soundtrack, are you?

556
00:21:52,054 --> 00:21:53,822
I'm not even gonna
respond to that.

557
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:55,591
- So, yes. Last one.
- Hi.

558
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:56,592
Hi.

559
00:21:56,626 --> 00:21:59,028
- Sam Cooke.
- Who's Sam Cooke?

560
00:21:59,061 --> 00:22:01,930
- "Who's Sam Cooke?"
- Yeah, who's Sam Cooke?

561
00:22:01,964 --> 00:22:04,166
You know Phantom Planet,
but you don't know Sam Cooke?

00:25:20,095 --> 00:25:22,364
Richie Williams' version
of "Bad Girl."

630
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:25,167
- (ascending synthesizer tone)
- Mm-hmm.

631
00:25:26,335 --> 00:25:27,202
Yeah.

632
00:25:27,236 --> 00:25:28,605
(electronic beat plays)

633
00:25:28,638 --> 00:25:32,274
(heavily processed vocal):
♪ Bad... girl ♪

634
00:25:32,307 --> 00:25:34,677
- Signature sound right there.
- Yep.

635
00:25:34,711 --> 00:25:37,246
(distorted vocalizations)

636
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,149
- (turns down volume)
- Is that dope, or is that dope?

637
00:25:41,818 --> 00:25:43,218
Trick question. This is dope.

638
00:25:43,252 --> 00:25:45,287
- Gotcha. - We know that.
- All of it.

639
00:25:46,388 --> 00:25:48,725
- What are you doing here, Maggie?
- Um...

640
00:25:48,758 --> 00:25:50,125
Richie Williams. R-Dubs.

641
00:25:50,158 --> 00:25:51,293
Grammy Award winner.

642
00:25:51,326 --> 00:25:52,427
I'm working on the album.
If you want to

643
00:25:52,461 --> 00:25:54,429
sit in the, uh, session,
I can mentor you a little bit.

644
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:56,532
Uh, it's important for me
to raise women up, you know?

645
00:25:56,565 --> 00:25:58,400
- Come on in here, sweetheart.
- JACK: Come on, man.

646
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:00,068
We ain't got time
for that, okay?

647
00:26:00,102 --> 00:26:01,036
All right.
Let's get back into it.

648
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:02,404
Let's focus on this.
Don't worry about her.

649
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:03,773
I mean, I'm...
Kind of feels done.

650
00:26:03,806 --> 00:26:05,173
Let's talk about it.

651
00:26:05,207 --> 00:26:06,241
This version of "Bad Girl."

652
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:07,543
The old one's
kind of old, right?

653
00:26:07,576 --> 00:26:09,545
Feels old or whatever.
I feel like this one

654
00:26:09,578 --> 00:26:12,147
spiced it up a little bit.
Feels global now.

655
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,683
Global, all right?

656
00:26:13,716 --> 00:26:15,752
Matter of fact, intergalactical.

657
00:26:15,785 --> 00:26:17,419
- Intergalactical.
- That's that EDM stuff, man.

658
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:18,453
This is just what
the doctor ordered.

659
00:26:18,487 --> 00:26:20,790
Grace, may I please speak
with you for a moment?

660
00:26:20,823 --> 00:26:22,424
- What?
- Um, well,

661
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:25,193
- I just, um, wanted to...
- Oh, my God, spit it out.

662
00:26:25,227 --> 00:26:27,730
I... I did a cut of the album.

663
00:26:27,764 --> 00:26:29,431
- Wh...
- I did a cut.

664
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:31,366
Seth helped me.

665
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,435
You hadn't hired anybody
to do it yet,

666
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:35,437
and I didn't want
to tell you or Jack.

667
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,607
JACK (over speaker):
Hey, hey. We can hear y'all.

668
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,508
Y'all know it's a damn
microphone in there, right?

669
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:42,177
How long have you been
working on this?

670
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,846
I came in before work
and after work

671
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,247
and whenever I could.

672
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,382
- I should have asked you.
- Yeah.

673
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:49,151
I just wanted to take a shot.

674
00:26:50,853 --> 00:26:52,321
Do you want to hear it?

675
00:26:52,354 --> 00:26:54,456
- Okay. I... (sighs)
- JACK: Hell nah.

676
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:57,326
- MAGGIE: This is the spine of the song.
- (music playing)

677
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:59,561
You're always talking about how
there has to be a heartbeat,

678
00:26:59,595 --> 00:27:02,230
something to hold onto
and then give away,

679
00:27:02,264 --> 00:27:03,432
and this is it.

680
00:27:03,465 --> 00:27:05,635
- (drumbeat begins)
- Hanky's been playing this drum track

681
00:27:05,668 --> 00:27:08,871
for 20 years, and it still
sounds as tight as it did

682
00:27:08,905 --> 00:27:10,339
on the day you recorded it.

683
00:27:10,372 --> 00:27:11,841
- Richard.
- R-Dawg.

684
00:27:11,874 --> 00:27:13,408
Did you redo this with a synth?

685
00:27:13,442 --> 00:27:15,377
It's actually called
cross synthesis,

686
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,379
which I invented,
which takes one synth

687
00:27:17,412 --> 00:27:19,616
and cancels the other out
when they play at the same time.

688
00:27:19,649 --> 00:27:20,650
Sounds dope.

689
00:27:20,683 --> 00:27:21,818
That doesn't make any sense.

690
00:27:21,851 --> 00:27:23,485
- RICHIE: Yeah, it does.
- JACK: It does.

691
00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:24,821
You've heard of
cross synthesis, right?

692
00:27:24,854 --> 00:27:26,288
No, but it don't matter.

693
00:27:26,321 --> 00:27:27,724
- You the producer.
- Yeah.

694
00:27:27,757 --> 00:27:29,391
You took out the backup singers?

695
00:27:29,424 --> 00:27:30,927
They're kind of old-sounding,
I mean, honestly.

696
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,629
We got plug-ins
that do that stuff.

697
00:27:32,662 --> 00:27:35,163
- Ah.
- We don't even need backup singers anymore.

698
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:37,265
I put my voice in there
and stacked it,

699
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:38,533
- put some Auto-Tune.
- ♪ Bad... girl ♪

700
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:39,568
It sounds brand-new.
Sounds great.

701
00:27:39,602 --> 00:27:42,905
- MAGGIE: Grace, do you hear this?
- ♪ Bad... ♪

702
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:44,707
- You are the song.
- (song continues)

703
00:27:44,741 --> 00:27:48,343
You should not be buried
under all this flashy bullshit.

704
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:51,346
Sure, the track needs
some mixing and some editing,

705
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,348
but you could release
your demos,

706
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:55,618
and they would be way better

707
00:27:55,652 --> 00:27:58,186
than anything
that he's ever, ever done.

708
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,656
(scoffs) Yeah, right.

709
00:27:59,689 --> 00:28:01,456
I actually think you should
release your demos,

710
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,759
because I've heard them,
and they're unbelievable.

711
00:28:02,792 --> 00:28:05,460
Who the hell you think you are?
Missy Elliott?

712
00:28:05,494 --> 00:28:06,461
RICHIE:
Who releases demos?

713
00:28:06,495 --> 00:28:07,630
JACK: How you gonna
come in here and insult

714
00:28:07,664 --> 00:28:08,597
- my man Richie?
- MAGGIE: Plenty of artists. Bob Dylan...

715
00:28:08,631 --> 00:28:10,565
- Okay, okay, okay.
- JACK: Go to Starbucks.

716
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:12,534
Everybody, stop.

717
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:14,871
- (music stops)
- (buttons clicking)

718
00:28:14,904 --> 00:28:17,406
Margaret, never talk to anyone

719
00:28:17,439 --> 00:28:19,642
that Jack has hired that way
again, do you understand?

720
00:28:19,676 --> 00:28:20,843
Yeah.

721
00:28:20,877 --> 00:28:22,344
- Okay.
- Yes.

722
00:28:22,377 --> 00:28:23,813
- Never.
- Never.

723
00:28:23,846 --> 00:28:25,414
We got a hit.

724
00:28:25,447 --> 00:28:27,516
We got a big one.
(chuckles)

725
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:28,651
- (makes whooshing sound)
- JACK: It's a hit.

726
00:28:28,685 --> 00:28:31,286
- My version, not hers.
- Don't worry about hers, man.

727
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,989
- Oh, I'm not.
- See what I'm dealing with here?

728
00:28:33,022 --> 00:28:34,556
RICHE:
She was kind of mean, right?

729
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:36,391
- JACK: She is very abrasive.
- Use her cut.

730
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:38,293
- What?
- Wha...

731
00:28:38,326 --> 00:28:39,962
RICHIE:
I'm still getting paid, right?

732
00:28:39,996 --> 00:28:41,530
(door closes)

733
00:28:43,733 --> 00:28:46,535
JACK:
Maggie. Maggie!

734
00:28:46,568 --> 00:28:48,203
Come here.

735
00:28:49,304 --> 00:28:51,573
I don't know what planet
you come from

736
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:53,676
where rattling off
every little opinion

737
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,311
that's rolling around
in that brain of yours

738
00:28:56,344 --> 00:28:57,747
is considered a skill.

739
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,314
But...

740
00:28:59,347 --> 00:29:00,783
I was right.

741
00:29:00,817 --> 00:29:02,451
This is not about being right

742
00:29:02,484 --> 00:29:05,021
in the studio
for a moment in time.

743
00:29:05,054 --> 00:29:06,723
This is a marathon.

744
00:29:06,756 --> 00:29:08,758
I'm sorry, I disagree.
I think if she put out

745
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:11,894
something like that...
oh, my God.

746
00:29:11,928 --> 00:29:13,730
Obviously.

747
00:29:13,763 --> 00:29:17,033
We would never put out
garbage like that.

748
00:29:17,066 --> 00:29:19,602
But that's besides the point.

749
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:24,539
It took me months to get them
in a studio together.

750
00:29:24,573 --> 00:29:25,641
Months.

751
00:29:25,675 --> 00:29:27,877
Off the off chance
she might say,

752
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:30,747
"Hey, Jack,
I want to do a remix album."

753
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,750
And I say,
"I got the perfect person.

754
00:29:33,783 --> 00:29:35,317
"Oh, damn.

755
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,352
"We can't work with him anymore

756
00:29:37,385 --> 00:29:41,891
"because your dumbass assistant
insulted the man,

757
00:29:41,924 --> 00:29:44,426
"and he don't want to work
with you no more.

758
00:29:44,459 --> 00:29:46,629
He'd rather do Rihanna."

759
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:52,769
Well, I...
I apologize for that.

760
00:29:52,802 --> 00:29:54,569
(Jack sighs)

761
00:29:54,604 --> 00:29:57,073
And-and now that
I'm the producer,

762
00:29:57,106 --> 00:29:59,341
I will look for my replacement.

763
00:29:59,374 --> 00:30:02,812
Do you know how long
it took for Seth

764
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:05,915
to get a little-bitty
engineering credit?

765
00:30:05,948 --> 00:30:11,386
Being a producer is about
having a point of view

766
00:30:11,419 --> 00:30:15,925
that you've earned
over years of hard work.

767
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:17,927
It don't happen like this.

768
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,329
You're not a producer.
You're not a artist.

769
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:22,965
You're not a manager.

770
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:26,434
If you want to be a producer,

771
00:30:26,468 --> 00:30:29,437
you find your own
goddamn clients

772
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:31,808
and stay the hell out of mine.

We're gonna go in there.

Then we're gonna

No, we don't have to

I went, technically, to
Elton John's, um, Oscar party.

785
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:11,747
That doesn't count.

786
00:31:11,781 --> 00:31:13,816
You stood outside
the entire time.

787
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:14,851
Whoa, he has a pool?

788
00:31:14,884 --> 00:31:16,551
- (upbeat R&B music playing)
- (people whooping)

789
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:19,856
Do any of them have jobs?

790
00:31:19,889 --> 00:31:20,690
Hi. Excuse me.

791
00:31:20,723 --> 00:31:22,825
- Do you have a job?
- I'm a model.

792
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:23,793
Okay.

793
00:31:23,826 --> 00:31:25,728
(loudly):
It's a Wednesday.

794
00:31:25,761 --> 00:31:27,462
MAGGIE: I didn't think
you'd ever wear it.

795
00:31:27,495 --> 00:31:29,031
What is... Oh, my God.

796
00:31:29,065 --> 00:31:31,968
Wait, I thought you said
he performed at a grocery store,

797
00:31:32,001 --> 00:31:33,568
not that he owned it.

798
00:31:33,603 --> 00:31:35,137
- You ready?
- WOMAN: Yes, I'm coming.

799
00:31:35,171 --> 00:31:36,639
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- (woman laughing)

800
00:31:36,672 --> 00:31:38,473
- (gasps)
- (laughing): Oh. My drink.

801
00:31:38,506 --> 00:31:39,308
- Ooh!
- Oh, my God.

802
00:31:39,342 --> 00:31:41,944
- Is it bad?
- (laughing): Oh, my...

803
00:31:41,978 --> 00:31:43,613
Ugh, this is so crazy.

804
00:31:43,646 --> 00:31:45,948
I know.
Why does he have a blow-dryer?

805
00:31:46,983 --> 00:31:48,150
I don't even know him.

806
00:31:48,184 --> 00:31:50,853
"Hey, man, um, from last week.

807
00:31:50,887 --> 00:31:53,488
"I just want you
to remind yourself of me,

808
00:31:53,521 --> 00:31:54,891
"and I would like to tell you

809
00:31:54,924 --> 00:31:56,491
"that I'm just
a personal assistant,

810
00:31:56,524 --> 00:31:57,894
"but I'd love to produce
your music,

811
00:31:57,927 --> 00:32:00,162
- if you got any."
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

812
00:32:00,196 --> 00:32:01,998
Look, all I do is basically

813
00:32:02,031 --> 00:32:03,633
clean up
biohazardous materials,

814
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:06,168
but I get to walk around
and call myself a doctor.

815
00:32:06,202 --> 00:32:07,535
That's not all you do.

816
00:32:07,569 --> 00:32:09,504
Exactly.
Do not sell yourself short.

817
00:32:09,537 --> 00:32:11,140
- Uh... (sighs) I'm...
- You just produced

818
00:32:11,173 --> 00:32:14,677
a live Grace Davis album
for no money and no credit.

819
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,646
And you're gonna do it again.
You know why?

820
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:18,114
Because you're following
your dream.

821
00:32:18,147 --> 00:32:20,650
No, that's not my dream.
I don't want to do that again.

822
00:32:20,683 --> 00:32:21,984
I'd love to get
money and credit.

823
00:32:22,018 --> 00:32:23,119
God, he has so many products.

824
00:32:23,152 --> 00:32:24,654
Ooh.

825
00:32:24,687 --> 00:32:26,588
Feels like we shouldn't
go through his stuff yet,

826
00:32:26,622 --> 00:32:28,190
- 'cause we don't even know him.
- Well, I've done it,

827
00:32:28,224 --> 00:32:30,660
and here we are. Look, you need
to pull yourself together

828
00:32:30,693 --> 00:32:32,895
and tell your vision-impaired,
fresh-breathed client

829
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:34,797
that you are a producer.

830
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,532
- I am not a...
- (water splashes)

831
00:32:37,565 --> 00:32:39,534
You are so lucky, Maggie.

832
00:32:39,567 --> 00:32:40,903
So you get out there,

833
00:32:40,937 --> 00:32:42,939
- and you close that deal.
- Okay.

834
00:32:42,972 --> 00:32:44,707
You're way too comfortable
in his house.

835
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,808
- You are.
- (laughing): I am not.

836
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:47,076
- DAVID: Hello.
- Oh, that's you.

837
00:32:47,109 --> 00:32:48,144
(chuckles)
That's him.

838
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:49,477
Thanks for dressing up.

839
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:51,446
Oh. That's...
(chuckles)

840
00:32:52,081 --> 00:32:53,249
This is Katie.

841
00:32:53,282 --> 00:32:54,750
- She's my roommate.
- Katie. Hi.

842
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,551
- Nice to meet you.
- You're very handsome.

843
00:32:56,584 --> 00:32:58,586
- Thank you.
- Did you know that Maggie's

844
00:32:58,621 --> 00:33:00,089
- a music producer?
- No, I didn't.

845
00:33:00,122 --> 00:33:01,023
KATIE:
Yeah, she's amazing.

846
00:33:01,057 --> 00:33:03,993
I like to say
the ear of our generation.

847
00:33:04,026 --> 00:33:06,262
Katie, thank you so much
for coming to this party.

848
00:33:06,295 --> 00:33:09,564
Got it. I'm gonna see how much
cheese I can fit into my bag.

849
00:33:09,597 --> 00:33:12,001
- Mm.
- And then I'm gonna look his house up on Zillow.

850
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:13,703
Please don't.

851
00:33:14,569 --> 00:33:16,839
Can't make any promises.

852
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:18,506
- Oh, my God.
- You want, uh,

853
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,876
another drink
to actually drink this time?

854
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,845
And here I was thinking
you had a crush on me

855
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:24,246
and just had to see me again.

856
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,048
Oh, no, I'm just here
for the pipes.

857
00:33:26,082 --> 00:33:29,185
Babe, I thought you were
bringing me a vodka Red Bull.

858
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:31,120
Uh, Theresa, this is Maggie.

859
00:33:31,153 --> 00:33:32,621
Maggie's a producer.

860
00:33:32,655 --> 00:33:33,689
THERESA:
Cool.

861
00:33:33,723 --> 00:33:35,191
I work at SpaceX.

862
00:33:35,224 --> 00:33:37,592
Cool.

863
00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:45,301
Why don't you come out?
DJ for us.

864
00:33:45,334 --> 00:33:47,603
Wow.

865
00:33:47,636 --> 00:33:49,105
Is that your girlfriend?

866
00:33:49,138 --> 00:33:51,607
She's not looking
for anything serious.

867
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,309
Good for her.

868
00:33:53,342 --> 00:33:54,576
Mm-hmm.

869
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,045
You have some lipstick.

870
00:33:56,078 --> 00:33:56,979
Right here?

871
00:33:57,013 --> 00:33:59,281
- All around your face.
- Mm.

872
00:33:59,315 --> 00:34:01,250
Do you have any songs recorded?

873
00:34:01,283 --> 00:34:02,584
Yeah.

874
00:34:02,618 --> 00:34:03,753
Can I hear them?

875
00:34:03,786 --> 00:34:05,287
Now?

876
00:34:05,321 --> 00:34:06,789
Yeah.

877
00:34:06,822 --> 00:34:09,591
(piano-based R&B song playing)

878
00:34:12,328 --> 00:34:15,197
♪ It's incomprehensible ♪

879
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:18,000
♪ Excitement I've never known ♪

880
00:34:18,034 --> 00:34:21,170

00:34:27,209 --> 00:34:29,912

886
00:34:36,052 --> 00:34:37,787
(clears throat)
This is pretty good.

887
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,988
Did you write this?

888
00:34:39,021 --> 00:34:41,257
Yeah, it took me,
like, 20 minutes.

889
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,825
The first verse?

890
00:34:42,858 --> 00:34:44,894
- Whole song.
- (chuckles)

891
00:34:44,927 --> 00:34:48,664
Why are you performing
at grocery stores?

892
00:34:48,697 --> 00:34:50,199
I like it.

893
00:34:50,232 --> 00:34:52,068
It's fun. It's no pressure.

894
00:34:52,101 --> 00:34:54,170
It's just... it's nice.

895
00:34:54,203 --> 00:34:57,073
Well, you can write.

896
00:34:57,106 --> 00:35:00,843
And you've got the voice
and the tone

897
00:35:00,876 --> 00:35:03,779
and, I mean,
an amazing record collection.

898
00:35:03,813 --> 00:35:05,648
That Marvin Gaye and...

899
00:35:05,681 --> 00:35:06,949
This Elmore James,

900
00:35:06,982 --> 00:35:09,785
I had this CD in my car
for, like, six years.

901
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:11,821
That was the first album
my dad gave me.

902
00:35:11,854 --> 00:35:13,089
Really?

903
00:35:13,122 --> 00:35:14,990
(chuckles)

904
00:35:16,792 --> 00:35:19,128
Well, I, um...
I would love to...

905
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:21,130
I mean, if you are...

906
00:35:21,163 --> 00:35:25,101
I-I could work with you
if you wanted.

907
00:35:25,134 --> 00:35:26,402
I'm listening.

908
00:35:26,435 --> 00:35:27,970
(chuckles)

909
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:30,005
Well, you have an amazing sound.

910
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:31,040
Thank you.

911
00:35:31,073 --> 00:35:33,676
I mean, there's a couple
of things that I-I-I...

912
00:35:33,709 --> 00:35:34,844
If I may?

913
00:35:34,877 --> 00:35:36,779
Please, you may.
(chuckles)

914
00:35:36,812 --> 00:35:41,951
Um, I think that your producer
might, uh, be...

915
00:35:41,984 --> 00:35:43,719
(stammers):
sucks.

916
00:35:43,752 --> 00:35:45,888
He's a friend of mine,
and he does it for free.

917
00:35:45,921 --> 00:35:51,427
I mean, what... what exactly
do you want to do differently?

918
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,296
Well, to start, I would...

919
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:56,065
Your bassist is way too loud.

920
00:35:56,098 --> 00:35:58,367
And then I'd probably drop
that weird drum track.

921
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,603
And then I'd move the bridge up.

922
00:35:59,635 --> 00:36:03,739
And then you should definitely
be singing into a real mic.

923
00:36:03,772 --> 00:36:05,908
(laughing):
I mean, I'm so sorry, but where

924
00:36:05,941 --> 00:36:07,376
did you record this,
in a closet?

925
00:36:07,409 --> 00:36:08,677
Wine cellar.

926
00:36:08,711 --> 00:36:10,146
Who?

927
00:36:10,179 --> 00:36:11,046
My wine cellar.

928
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,949
I thought the acoustics
would be better.

929
00:36:13,983 --> 00:36:14,884
Ooh.

930
00:36:14,917 --> 00:36:16,352
Will you send me the files?

931
00:36:16,385 --> 00:36:17,386
No.

932
00:36:17,419 --> 00:36:19,054
Please?

933
00:36:22,758 --> 00:36:24,927
Come to my show next week.

934
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,462
(chuckling):
Oh.

935
00:36:26,495 --> 00:36:29,365
Um, I... well,
I should ask Katie,

936
00:36:29,398 --> 00:36:30,933
'cause next week, I was...

937
00:36:30,966 --> 00:36:33,202
- What's that?
- A jacket.

938
00:36:33,235 --> 00:36:35,237
So I'll see you next Friday?

939
00:36:36,438 --> 00:36:38,941
Oh, my God.
Do you wear this?

940
00:36:38,974 --> 00:36:40,776
- (Maggie laughing)
- (sighing): Oh, my God.

941
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:41,977
What is that?

942
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:43,179
This looks like Stevie Nicks

943
00:36:43,212 --> 00:36:45,147
ran over Jason Derulo
with her car.

944
00:36:45,181 --> 00:36:47,082
- Okay. All right, we're done.
- Oh, my God.

945
00:36:47,116 --> 00:36:49,285
- Thank you so much. We're good.
- That is wild.

946
00:36:49,318 --> 00:36:50,920
That's enough. That's enough.

947
00:36:50,953 --> 00:36:53,088
(smooth R&B track playing)

948
00:37:03,766 --> 00:37:06,235
(track continues playing
over speakers)

949
00:37:11,974 --> 00:37:14,376
KATIE: Hey, you know
who's been up for 37 hours?

950
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,111
Me.

951
00:37:17,012 --> 00:37:18,247
You dick.

952
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,982
(birds chirping)

953
00:37:22,384 --> 00:37:25,221
So, if you can please just
make sure that she takes

954
00:37:25,254 --> 00:37:27,957
the, uh, fish oil
and the little green one

955
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,792
after she eats dinner
because they upset her stomach.

956
00:37:29,825 --> 00:37:31,427
Wow, you're really
the only person I know

957
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,229
who can make pills not fun.

958
00:37:33,262 --> 00:37:34,296
Wait.

959
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,497
Why are you leaving early?

960
00:37:35,531 --> 00:37:36,799
You never leave early.

961
00:37:36,832 --> 00:37:38,267
Um...

962
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:42,137
because I got to go to
this thing at, uh, the airport.

963
00:37:42,171 --> 00:37:44,039
'Cause my gr... my gran
is, like, demanding...

964
00:37:44,073 --> 00:37:46,108
Well, I don't care
about any of that.

965
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:47,176
Sorry.

966
00:37:47,209 --> 00:37:48,210
And I don't believe it.

967
00:37:48,244 --> 00:37:51,113
It sounds like a whole lot
of "B"... bull crap.

968
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:53,315
This is exactly what happens.

969
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:55,150
It starts off with a thing,

970
00:37:55,184 --> 00:37:56,852
and then you're gonna ask
for a weekend off.

971
00:37:56,885 --> 00:37:58,420
All of you assistants
are the same.

972
00:37:58,454 --> 00:38:02,191
You get lured in here
by the glitz, the glamour,

973
00:38:02,224 --> 00:38:04,893
the swag, the celebrity,
the pool house.

974
00:38:04,927 --> 00:38:06,562
You live in the pool house.

975
00:38:06,595 --> 00:38:08,464
And you could, too.

976
00:38:08,497 --> 00:38:10,132
Not at this moment,

977
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:12,301
because I'm not in the market
for a roommate,

978
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:13,969
but maybe someday.

979
00:38:14,003 --> 00:38:16,405
If you play your cards right.

980
00:38:16,438 --> 00:38:18,507
What are you doing?

981
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,010
This is all available to you.

982
00:38:21,043 --> 00:38:22,344
Ah!

983
00:38:22,378 --> 00:38:24,880
Ha. Found them.

984
00:38:24,913 --> 00:38:27,082
Wow, I thought you were
cleaning the pool.

985
00:38:27,116 --> 00:38:29,084
See, these are
a gift from Grace.

986
00:38:29,118 --> 00:38:31,453
Do I prefer Dior?
Of course I do.

987
00:38:31,487 --> 00:38:32,921
Am I gonna tell her that?

988
00:38:32,955 --> 00:38:35,357
No. I'm gonna be grateful
for what I have

989
00:38:35,391 --> 00:38:38,894
and for what she's discarded
because she's bored with it,

990
00:38:38,927 --> 00:38:41,196
'cause then it comes to me.

991
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,032
And I can wear it.

992
00:38:43,065 --> 00:38:45,434
And you got to start carrying
a notebook around

993
00:38:45,467 --> 00:38:47,036
to write this stuff down.

994
00:38:47,069 --> 00:38:49,405
GRACE:
Margaret!

995
00:38:49,438 --> 00:38:51,807
(groans)

996
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,209
Margaret!

997
00:38:55,244 --> 00:38:56,412
Margaret!

998
00:38:57,446 --> 00:38:59,815
Margaret!

999
00:39:00,516 --> 00:39:02,818
Margaret!

1000
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,554
Margaret!

1001
00:39:05,587 --> 00:39:06,588
Hi.

1002
00:39:06,623 --> 00:39:08,057
What do you think of this?

1003
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,391
Do you think it's too booby?

1004
00:39:09,425 --> 00:39:11,327
Mm, yes.

1005
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,594
Oh.

1006
00:39:12,629 --> 00:39:13,962
Perfect.

1007
00:39:13,996 --> 00:39:15,597
You can go.

1008
00:39:15,632 --> 00:39:17,599
Oh. Okay, great.
Thank you so much.

1009
00:39:17,634 --> 00:39:19,902
No, not you.
You guys can go.

1010
00:39:19,935 --> 00:39:21,270
- Thank you.
- BOTH: Oh.

1011
00:39:21,303 --> 00:39:22,271
- Thanks.
- Okay.

1012
00:39:22,304 --> 00:39:24,073
- GRACE: Okay, bye.
- STYLIST: Bye, Miss Davis.

1013
00:39:24,106 --> 00:39:25,874
- Well, Margaret.
- Yeah?

1014
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:30,913
Are you sure all of this
is still okay with you?

1015
00:39:30,946 --> 00:39:31,947
Um...

1016
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,383
'Cause after that little show

1017
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:39,488
at the recording studio,
I'm... I'm not sure.

1018
00:39:39,521 --> 00:39:41,490
Because if there is something
else you want to be doing,

1019
00:39:41,523 --> 00:39:44,293
I don't want you to be here
if you don't want to be here.

1020
00:39:46,696 --> 00:39:49,331
No, Grace, I, um...

1021
00:39:50,532 --> 00:39:52,501
- Yes?
- I want to be here.

1022
00:39:52,534 --> 00:39:54,203
Good.

1023
00:39:54,236 --> 00:39:56,372
Because I want to go
through my closet

1024
00:39:56,405 --> 00:39:59,508
and donate things that aren't
sparking joy or whatever.

1025
00:39:59,541 --> 00:40:00,943
Yeah, right now?

1026
00:40:00,976 --> 00:40:02,578
Yeah.

1027
00:40:02,612 --> 00:40:04,246
Great.

1028
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:06,181
(classical music playing
quietly)

1029
00:40:07,182 --> 00:40:08,016
Joy.

1030
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,119
- Definitely joy.
- Joy.

1031
00:40:10,152 --> 00:40:12,388
(gasps) Oh, my God.

1032
00:40:12,421 --> 00:40:13,389
Mm.

1033
00:40:13,422 --> 00:40:15,457
- Joy.
- Joyful.

1034
00:40:15,491 --> 00:40:17,694
- How's everybody doing?
- (applause, cheering)

1035
00:40:17,727 --> 00:40:19,629
Yeah, that's what
I like to hear.

1036
00:40:19,662 --> 00:40:22,564
Well, I'm David Cliff,
and this is my band, and, uh,

1037
00:40:22,598 --> 00:40:25,300
we're gonna play a couple songs
for y'all, if that's all right.

1038
00:40:25,334 --> 00:40:27,302
- (cheering, applause)
- DAVID: All right.

1039
00:40:32,374 --> 00:40:36,111
Obviously, I'm keeping
the Gianni Versace.

1040
00:40:36,145 --> 00:40:38,981
- Obviously.
- Yeah.

1041
00:40:39,014 --> 00:40:41,283
All right.
So we did all the evening wear.

1042
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:43,218
(Grace gasps)

1043
00:40:43,252 --> 00:40:45,487
Let's do
the early-evening wear.

1044
00:40:45,521 --> 00:40:47,523
- Come on.
- Okay.

1045
00:40:48,691 --> 00:40:49,591
- (cheering, applause)
- All right,

1046
00:40:49,626 --> 00:40:51,527
I've got one more song
for y'all tonight.

1047
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,729
MAN:
Oh, come on!

1048
00:40:52,762 --> 00:40:55,464
(scattered shouts, whooping)

1049
00:40:55,497 --> 00:40:57,166
Thanks for coming.

1050
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:58,534
- (mid-tempo drumbeat starts)
- (mouthing)

1051
00:40:58,567 --> 00:41:02,404

"Let's Stay Together")

you'd show up.

1057
00:41:20,022 --> 00:41:21,323
Well, we had a deal.

1058
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:22,991
- Ah, okay.
- (chuckles)

1059
00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:24,326
So, what'd you think?

1060
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:27,496
Um, uh, well, that was
a great song choice.

1061
00:41:27,529 --> 00:41:28,564
Huh.

1062
00:41:28,597 --> 00:41:29,732
And you sounded incredible.

1063
00:41:29,766 --> 00:41:31,200
Really good.

1064
00:41:31,233 --> 00:41:33,368
Great start. What else?

1065
00:41:34,436 --> 00:41:37,072
Um, well...

1066
00:41:37,105 --> 00:41:39,107
- your band...
- I knew it.

1067
00:41:39,141 --> 00:41:40,342
You couldn't even last a minute.

1068
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:42,244
- Well, the drummer.
- That's my friend.

1069
00:41:42,277 --> 00:41:43,378
Is he?

1070
00:41:43,412 --> 00:41:44,747
- Is he really?
- Here we go.

1071
00:41:44,781 --> 00:41:46,548
Here we go again. Wow.

1072
00:41:46,582 --> 00:41:49,485
You asked me,
and I'm not gonna tell you

1073
00:41:49,518 --> 00:41:52,755
that they're great
if they're not great.

1074
00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:55,257
I know there's a compliment
in there somewhere for me,

1075
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:57,694
if you want to be more direct.

1076
00:41:57,727 --> 00:41:59,696
Can I show you something?

1077
00:41:59,729 --> 00:42:01,563
Is this your car?

1078
00:42:01,597 --> 00:42:03,098
Yeah.

1079
00:42:03,131 --> 00:42:05,534
Should I sign a waiver?

1080
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:10,439
(grunting):
Okay.

1081

1084
00:42:21,483 --> 00:42:23,151

The drum pattern is not bad.

1088
00:42:29,692 --> 00:42:32,695
I also brought you up a bit,
and I rerecorded the guitar.

1089
00:42:32,729 --> 00:42:34,496
Yes, it's good.

1090
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,799
It's g... it's good.

1091
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:38,801
You have real talent.

1092
00:42:38,835 --> 00:42:40,469
You really do.

1093
00:42:40,502 --> 00:42:42,672
Do you need me? No.

1094
00:42:42,705 --> 00:42:45,407
But you should want me
because I think I can help

1095
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,277
bring out an entirely
different sound in you.

1096
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:50,647
And if you work with me,
I can get you heard

1097
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,814
by the right people.

1098
00:42:51,848 --> 00:42:53,382
Oh, I'm not worried about that.

1099
00:42:53,415 --> 00:42:55,417
I just want to know who else...

1100
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:58,086
who else you working with
right now.

1101
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,122
A producer never
discusses artists

1102
00:43:00,155 --> 00:43:01,356
with other artists.

1103
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:03,693
That's just not
part of the... those...

1104
00:43:03,726 --> 00:43:05,527
- It's...
- Okay.

1105
00:43:05,561 --> 00:43:06,796
Okay.

1106
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:09,197
How do you, um...

1107
00:43:10,299 --> 00:43:12,835
How do you know
how to do all of this stuff?

1108
00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:14,871
(chuckles)

1109
00:43:14,904 --> 00:43:17,439
- (music stops)
- I grew up around music

1110
00:43:17,472 --> 00:43:19,575
and musicians
and people talking about music.

1111
00:43:19,609 --> 00:43:23,211
My dad worked in radio,
and my mom was a singer.

1112
00:43:23,245 --> 00:43:25,280
And then I went to school
for composing,

1113
00:43:25,314 --> 00:43:29,451
and then immediately after,
I started, um, producing.

1114
00:43:29,484 --> 00:43:32,187
If you could point
to any time in my life,

1115
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,589
good or bad, I could tell you

1116
00:43:33,623 --> 00:43:36,124
who I was listening to
and how I got through it.

1117
00:43:36,158 --> 00:43:41,330
And if I had the opportunity
to work with an artist like you

1118
00:43:41,363 --> 00:43:45,500
and create something
that could maybe make somebody

1119
00:43:45,534 --> 00:43:48,303
or anybody feel
a little bit less alone,

1120
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:51,139
then I want to be
a part of that.

1121
00:43:51,173 --> 00:43:53,575
I know how to
be a part of that.

1122
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:54,877

recorded at
her tenth world tour.

1154

The music icon has remained
a remarkably private person.

1155
00:45:06,581 --> 00:45:08,316
She's never married
or had children

about her plans for the future.

00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:15,758
when can they expect
another hit?

No, you look great.
A-Amazing.

1170
00:45:42,051 --> 00:45:43,920
I don't eat dessert.

00:45:43,953 --> 00:45:45,454
Okay.

1172
00:45:45,487 --> 00:45:49,458

That's your dad?

- Yeah.
- Wow.

1196
00:46:47,683 --> 00:46:48,550
Sax player.

1197
00:46:48,583 --> 00:46:50,853
He plays better
than anyone else I know.

1198
00:46:50,887 --> 00:46:53,388
So, you said your mom
was a singer?

1199
00:46:53,421 --> 00:46:56,458
Well, she was.
Um, she died when I was six.

1200
00:46:56,491 --> 00:46:58,426
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

1201
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,663
Um, she, uh, met my dad

1202
00:47:00,696 --> 00:47:02,698
backstage at
a Paul Simon concert.

1203
00:47:02,732 --> 00:47:05,668
My dad was there
covering the show for work.

1204
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:08,838
And they met, and then she
moved in with him the next day,

1205
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:11,007
and they got married
a month later.

1206
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,374
Pretty crazy.

1207
00:47:12,407 --> 00:47:14,442
Not that crazy.

1208
00:47:15,111 --> 00:47:16,813
What about your mom and dad?

1209
00:47:16,846 --> 00:47:18,681
Never married.

1210
00:47:18,714 --> 00:47:22,584
My mom, um, she left me
with my dad when I was little.

1211
00:47:23,485 --> 00:47:26,088
And, um, it was complicated.

1212
00:47:26,122 --> 00:47:27,857
I don't know.

1213
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:29,926
My dad's cool, though.

1214
00:47:29,959 --> 00:47:32,427
Pissed I don't play sax, but...

1215
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,529
you know, he...
he's there for me.

1216
00:47:34,563 --> 00:47:35,832
- Yeah.
- How's your head?

1217
00:47:35,865 --> 00:47:37,332
Let's see.

1218
00:47:38,034 --> 00:47:40,136
- Ooh. (laughs)
- "Ooh," what?

1219
00:47:40,169 --> 00:47:41,904
- Are you laughing at me?
- Oh, man.

1220
00:47:41,938 --> 00:47:43,538
This is my moneymaker,
so I don't really

00:49:33,649 --> 00:49:35,217
I have these
really incredible...

1260
00:49:35,251 --> 00:49:37,687
I can't.
Playing a bat mitzvah.

1261
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,622
- What?
- What?

1262
00:49:39,655 --> 00:49:41,824
I don't...
David, I don't understand.

1263
00:49:41,857 --> 00:49:44,260
The... Clearly, you're not
doing these gigs for money.

1264
00:49:44,293 --> 00:49:45,527
I don't...

1265
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,929
I made a commitment.

1266
00:49:46,963 --> 00:49:47,964
Okay.

1267
00:49:47,997 --> 00:49:50,700
I'm not gonna beg you
to take this seriously.

1268
00:49:50,733 --> 00:49:52,234
- (Maggie chuckles)
- Don't beg me.

1269
00:49:52,268 --> 00:49:55,771
David, you have
an incredible voice.

1270
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:00,242
When you sing, it's restrained

1271
00:50:00,276 --> 00:50:03,913
and impassioned
and nostalgic, and...

1272
00:50:03,946 --> 00:50:06,615
people outside of various
L.A. community centers

1273
00:50:06,649 --> 00:50:07,950
should hear it.

1274
00:50:07,984 --> 00:50:09,652
Yeah, but what if
I'm not good enough?

1275
00:50:09,685 --> 00:50:11,120
- What?
- What if I'm just

1276
00:50:11,153 --> 00:50:13,521
some douchebag who thought
he could be a singer

1277
00:50:13,555 --> 00:50:16,058
like everybody else,
and then what?

1278
00:50:16,092 --> 00:50:18,027
Then what am I supposed to do?

1279
00:50:20,162 --> 00:50:21,764
Oh, my God.

1280
00:50:21,797 --> 00:50:23,065
What?

1281
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:24,734
You're insecure.

1282
00:50:25,701 --> 00:50:27,703
(laughing):
This is amazing.

1283
00:50:27,737 --> 00:50:29,939
(chuckles)
I'm coming at you with

1284
00:50:29,972 --> 00:50:32,274
some deep-seated anxiety
right now, and...

1285
00:50:32,308 --> 00:50:34,877
No, you're just self-sabotaging,

1286
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:37,246
- and I can work with that.
- (cell phone ringing)

1287
00:50:37,279 --> 00:50:39,514
Sorry.

1288
00:50:40,649 --> 00:50:42,118
Hello? Hello?

1289
00:50:42,151 --> 00:50:44,020
Oh, okay. I will...

1290
00:50:44,053 --> 00:50:45,553
Yes, I'll be right there.

1291
00:50:45,587 --> 00:50:47,089
Okay.

1292
00:50:47,123 --> 00:50:51,894
Um, that was another client,
so I have to go.

1293
00:50:51,927 --> 00:50:53,595
You're amazing.

1294
00:50:53,629 --> 00:50:55,898
- All right.
- And I will see you soon.

1295
00:50:55,931 --> 00:50:58,100
- So...
- And we will continue this conversation.

1296
00:50:58,134 --> 00:50:59,969
- Yes.
- Okay, bye.

1297
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:03,272
Good night, Maggie.

1298
00:51:03,305 --> 00:51:06,541
Thank you. Very nice.

1299
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:09,945
Wait.

1300
00:51:09,979 --> 00:51:11,647
Is this your car?

1301
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,883
Why do people keep
asking me that? Yeah.

1302
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:16,652
You need to ask your boss
for a raise.

1303
00:51:16,685 --> 00:51:18,120
(laughing)

1304
00:51:19,822 --> 00:51:21,057
(laughing):
That's so funny.

1305
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:23,659
Do you get it?
Because I'm your boss.

1306
00:51:23,692 --> 00:51:25,661
- (Grace laughing)
- (rock music playing)

1307
00:51:25,694 --> 00:51:27,663
Hey. Do you get it?

1308
00:51:27,696 --> 00:51:29,665
Wait, pull over. Right here.

1309
00:51:29,698 --> 00:51:30,666
Right here, right here,
right here.

1310
00:51:30,699 --> 00:51:34,036
(loudly): Hey. Can I get
two carnitas, please?

1311
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:36,338
And one of them
should be chicken,

1312
00:51:36,372 --> 00:51:38,007
with hot sauce.

1313
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,308
(pops lips, laughs)

1314
00:51:39,341 --> 00:51:43,079
So, Michael B. Jordan insisted

1315
00:51:43,112 --> 00:51:47,383
that we leave my house
and go to a hotel

1316
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:50,686
because he had...

1317
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:55,324
this whole proposal planned.

1318
00:51:55,357 --> 00:51:58,694
We have very different problems.

1319
00:51:58,727 --> 00:52:00,963
What are your problems,
Margaret?

1320
00:52:00,996 --> 00:52:02,965
- Well, I mean...
- I'm hungry.

1321
00:52:02,998 --> 00:52:04,934
- Oh. Um...
- I'm so hungry.

1322
00:52:04,967 --> 00:52:07,636
- Okay.
- Is the food coming, sir?

1323
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:09,371
MAN:
Ma'am, we've been over this.

1324
00:52:09,405 --> 00:52:11,674
We are not a drive-through.

1325
00:52:11,707 --> 00:52:13,909
GRACE:
Okay, well, it should be.

1326
00:52:13,943 --> 00:52:15,311
- It could be.
- WOMAN: Oh, my God.

1327
00:52:15,344 --> 00:52:16,779
Is that Grace Davis?

1328
00:52:16,812 --> 00:52:17,813
- No.
- Hi.

1329
00:52:17,847 --> 00:52:18,814
Hi. I love you so much.

1330
00:52:18,848 --> 00:52:20,349
- I love you.
- Can I take a picture with you?

1331
00:52:20,382 --> 00:52:21,917
- Wow. Love, huh?
- (laughing): I know.

1332
00:52:21,951 --> 00:52:22,852
- Sure. Yeah.
- WOMAN: It's Grace Davis!

1333
00:52:22,885 --> 00:52:25,154
- I'm gonna get out. Hi.
- (fans clamoring)

1334
00:52:25,187 --> 00:52:27,123
- GRACE: Hi. This isn't my car.
- Hi.

1335
00:52:27,156 --> 00:52:29,058
- Hello.
- Okay, followers, look who I am with.

1336
00:52:29,091 --> 00:52:31,260
- It's Grace Davis!
- Okay, one, two.

1337
00:52:31,293 --> 00:52:32,394
Hi, Grace Davis!

1338
00:52:32,428 --> 00:52:33,729
- Hi!
- (camera clicks)

1339
00:52:33,762 --> 00:52:34,864
WOMAN:
You look gorgeous.

1340
00:52:34,897 --> 00:52:37,366
So glad I called you.

1341
00:52:37,399 --> 00:52:39,768
MAGGIE:
Uh, usually, you call Gail.

1342
00:52:39,802 --> 00:52:41,804
(blows raspberry)
Are you kidding me?

1343
00:52:41,837 --> 00:52:43,405
It's after 10:00.

1344
00:52:43,439 --> 00:52:45,407
Miss Gail is passed out.

1345
00:52:45,441 --> 00:52:47,143
(laughing)

1346
00:52:47,176 --> 00:52:50,012
Anyway, I thought you would
enjoy this time with me

1347
00:52:50,045 --> 00:52:53,215
'cause you're always
hanging around me,

1348
00:52:53,249 --> 00:52:55,317
just hanging around me.

1349
00:52:55,351 --> 00:52:57,353
That's my job.

1350
00:52:57,386 --> 00:52:58,854
You know what I mean.

1351
00:52:58,888 --> 00:53:01,023
(chuckles softly)

1352
00:53:01,056 --> 00:53:02,458
Mm.

1353
00:53:02,491 --> 00:53:05,161
Would you get married?

1354
00:53:05,194 --> 00:53:06,695
Oh, my God.

1355
00:53:06,729 --> 00:53:08,430
Not you, too.

1356
00:53:08,464 --> 00:53:13,736
I know that everybody wonders,
"Is Grace gonna find a man?"

1357
00:53:13,769 --> 00:53:15,704
I mean...

1358
00:53:15,738 --> 00:53:18,807
"Who's gonna put a ring on it?"

1359
00:53:18,841 --> 00:53:21,043
You know what?

1360
00:53:21,076 --> 00:53:24,246
(sighs)
I'm happy with me.

1361
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,448
I am happy with me.

1362
00:53:26,482 --> 00:53:28,717
Yup.

1363
00:53:29,952 --> 00:53:31,287
I just thought that maybe,

1364
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,255
if you were gonna do
anybody the favor,

1365
00:53:33,289 --> 00:53:36,091
then it may as well be
Michael B. Jordan.

1366
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:39,061
I almost did.

1367
00:53:39,094 --> 00:53:41,330
Once.

1368
00:53:41,363 --> 00:53:43,799
- Really?
- Yeah.

the whole thing.

1374

1376
00:54:07,556 --> 00:54:10,492
Then it did.

1377
00:54:10,526 --> 00:54:12,895
And I didn't choose him.

1378
00:54:14,163 --> 00:54:15,931
Obviously.

1379

I don't want it.

1381
00:54:22,238 --> 00:54:26,208
I chose those countertops
in the bathroom.

1382
00:54:26,242 --> 00:54:28,777
They were like,
"You can have two sinks."

1383
00:54:28,811 --> 00:54:30,813
And I was like, "No."
(scoffs)

1384
00:54:30,846 --> 00:54:34,216
"I want one... one big one."

1385
00:54:35,117 --> 00:54:37,286
- It is a very big sink.
- Mm-hmm.

steal from the needy

00:54:53,269 --> 00:54:56,238
and take this $3,000
Saint Laurent jacket?

01:03:11,901 --> 01:03:13,502
we think through
your next moves.

1573
01:03:13,535 --> 01:03:15,370
Yeah, what do you want
to do next?

1574
01:03:16,038 --> 01:03:18,808
Well, um...

1575
01:03:18,841 --> 01:03:20,810
I've been thinking, and...

1576
01:03:22,078 --> 01:03:25,280
I think it's time
I record a new album.

1577
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,089
JACK:
Um...

1578
01:03:33,122 --> 01:03:35,390
Well, I mean, that's one plan.

1579
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,859
(Jack laughs)

1580
01:03:36,893 --> 01:03:40,963
Um, we've talked about
a few different things,

1581
01:03:40,997 --> 01:03:43,633
and we really want to know
what you want to do.

1582
01:03:43,666 --> 01:03:47,804
I mean, where do you envision
Grace Davis in the future?

1583
01:03:47,837 --> 01:03:49,571
RYAN:
Yeah.

1584
01:03:49,605 --> 01:03:52,041
Have you thought any more about
the, uh... the Vegas residency?

1585
01:03:52,074 --> 01:03:53,910
We talked about Vegas, remember?

1586
01:03:53,943 --> 01:03:56,112
RYAN: We think it's
a cool, reliable way

1587
01:03:56,145 --> 01:03:58,748
for you to showcase
where you're at.

1588
01:04:02,018 --> 01:04:03,451
(Ryan clears throat quietly)

1589
01:04:05,721 --> 01:04:06,722
Could be fun.

1590
01:04:06,756 --> 01:04:08,658
JACK:
I mean, I'm-a have fun.

1591
01:04:08,691 --> 01:04:09,625
(laughter)

1592
01:04:09,659 --> 01:04:11,961
At least I can get
a damn drink somewhere.

1593
01:04:11,994 --> 01:04:14,096
- (laughter)
- Price of one.

1594
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:15,463
We'll get you a damn drink.

1595
01:04:15,497 --> 01:04:16,766
SPENCER:
We're super excited.

1596
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:18,366
And, uh, if you want,
I can show you

1597
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,434
the slideshow
that I put together.

1598
01:04:19,467 --> 01:04:21,804
(taking deep,
shuddering breaths)

1599
01:04:24,006 --> 01:04:26,676
- (door opens)
- (groans)

1600
01:04:30,613 --> 01:04:32,547
I don't want to talk about it.

1601
01:04:36,819 --> 01:04:38,888
I thought you didn't want
to do Vegas.

1602
01:04:38,921 --> 01:04:41,456
I said I didn't want
to talk about it.

1603
01:04:41,489 --> 01:04:43,358
It's a big commitment.

1604
01:04:44,492 --> 01:04:45,928
You heard what they said.

1605
01:04:45,962 --> 01:04:49,364
It's-it's... it's not the same
as it used to be.

1606
01:04:51,133 --> 01:04:52,602
Yeah.

1607
01:04:52,635 --> 01:04:54,469
Some of their ideas
weren't terrible.

1608
01:04:54,502 --> 01:04:56,906
Yeah. I think a Spotify-curated
Christmas album

1609
01:04:56,939 --> 01:04:58,140
could be super cool.

1610
01:04:58,174 --> 01:05:00,508
Okay, just say it, all right?

1611
01:05:00,542 --> 01:05:02,879
I get it.
I know what you're thinking.

1612
01:05:02,912 --> 01:05:03,980
I'm a sellout. I get it.

1613
01:05:04,013 --> 01:05:06,448
That was humiliating.
Yep. You got to witness it.

1614
01:05:06,481 --> 01:05:07,817
- That was...
- What? No.

1615
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:08,951
It's fantastic.

1616
01:05:08,985 --> 01:05:10,720
That's not what...

1617
01:05:10,753 --> 01:05:16,092
Grace, those pretentious
sparkling water blowhards

1618
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:18,628
just spoke to you
like they forgot

1619
01:05:18,661 --> 01:05:20,763
that you basically built
this entire label for them.

1620
01:05:20,796 --> 01:05:23,065
- They were just trying to help me.
- What?

1621
01:05:23,099 --> 01:05:26,035
You've got, like, years
of career moves ahead of you.

1622
01:05:26,068 --> 01:05:29,504
If you want to do Vegas,
then fine, do Vegas.

1623
01:05:29,537 --> 01:05:32,041
But don't do it like
it's your farewell tour.

1624
01:05:32,074 --> 01:05:33,209
It's not over for you.

1625
01:05:33,242 --> 01:05:34,576
You said it in there.

1626
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:36,112
You said it... a new album.

1627
01:05:36,145 --> 01:05:37,213
That is what
you should be doing.

1628
01:05:37,246 --> 01:05:40,182
Do you know what they were
avoiding saying in there?

1629
01:05:40,216 --> 01:05:41,918
What?

1630
01:05:41,951 --> 01:05:43,853
In the history of music,

1631
01:05:43,886 --> 01:05:49,557
only five women over 40
have ever had a number one hit.

1632
01:05:49,591 --> 01:05:51,727
And only one of them was black.

1633
01:05:51,761 --> 01:05:53,029
One.

1634
01:05:53,062 --> 01:05:55,064
Do you understand that?

1635
01:05:55,097 --> 01:05:56,598
No.

1636
01:05:56,632 --> 01:05:58,768
You do not understand that.

1637
01:05:58,801 --> 01:06:00,770
And none of you guys in there

1638
01:06:00,803 --> 01:06:02,972
understand what
I have been through.

1639
01:06:04,807 --> 01:06:07,243
So, I don't know.
Uh, we could just pretend.

1640
01:06:07,276 --> 01:06:10,545
We could pretend that we live
in some sort of magical world

1641
01:06:10,578 --> 01:06:12,580
where, I don't know...
let's see...

1642
01:06:12,615 --> 01:06:14,817
age and race are not a thing.

1643
01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:16,953
And then do you know
what the problem is?

1644
01:06:16,986 --> 01:06:20,756
I... not the label,
not Jack, not you...

1645
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:23,826
have to come up with shit
that people give a shit about,

1646
01:06:23,859 --> 01:06:25,728
and I don't know
how to do that anymore.

1647
01:06:25,761 --> 01:06:27,930
I don't know if I know
how to do that.

What?

1652
01:06:36,005 --> 01:06:37,139
I'm sorry, what?

01:06:37,173 --> 01:06:38,140
Oh, no, no, no.

1654
01:06:38,174 --> 01:06:39,742
Have you been going
through my private stuff?

1655
01:06:39,775 --> 01:06:40,776
- No.
- You know what? No.

1656
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:42,945

- No.

I am not your stepping-stone.

1660
01:06:51,287 --> 01:06:53,689
You're not a producer, Margaret.

1661
01:06:53,723 --> 01:06:55,725
I didn't ask you
to produce my song.

1662
01:06:55,758 --> 01:06:57,827
And I'm not gonna say
thank you, either.

1663
01:06:59,228 --> 01:07:00,663
You're an encyclopedia.

1664
01:07:00,696 --> 01:07:02,098
You memorize trivia.

1665
01:07:02,131 --> 01:07:04,566
You-you handle my itinerary.

1666
01:07:04,599 --> 01:07:08,671
You pick peanuts
out of kung pao chicken.

1667
01:07:08,704 --> 01:07:11,173
You're not the ticket
to people's breakthrough.

Okay?

they're way better than you

because they were setting me up
for an easy win.

1672
01:07:18,247 --> 01:07:20,983
And you, little lady,
are setting me up for a fail.

01:16:31,533 --> 01:16:33,168
JOSH (over phone):
Hey, girl.

1884
01:16:33,201 --> 01:16:35,605
Dan is so excited
for Grace's party later.

1885
01:16:35,638 --> 01:16:38,173
Well, that's what I was calling
to talk to you about.

1886
01:16:38,206 --> 01:16:39,441
Do you have a quick sec?

1887
01:16:39,474 --> 01:16:40,877
Uh, I'm actually
waiting on him to...

1888
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:42,679
get out of a meeting
right now, so...

1889
01:16:42,712 --> 01:16:44,446
Oh, a meeting. Really?

1890
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:45,581
Wha...

1891
01:16:45,615 --> 01:16:46,749
(laughs) Maggie?

1892
01:16:46,783 --> 01:16:49,384
- How did you know we were here?
- Please. Everybody knows

1893
01:16:49,418 --> 01:16:52,321
this is the first place
he comes when he comes to L.A.

1894
01:16:52,354 --> 01:16:54,423
- (chuckles): Oh.
- How long have you been

1895
01:16:54,456 --> 01:16:56,191
Dan's assistant?
Like, five years?

1896
01:16:56,224 --> 01:16:57,192
- Yeah.
- Have you ever wanted

1897
01:16:57,225 --> 01:16:59,729
to do something
other than be his assistant?

1898
01:16:59,762 --> 01:17:01,530
Well, between you and me,

1899
01:17:01,563 --> 01:17:03,332
I've been working
on a screenplay.

1900
01:17:03,365 --> 01:17:05,334
It's 200 pages,
but I'm confident.

1901
01:17:05,367 --> 01:17:06,568
- It's hilarious.
- Okay, great. Yeah.

1902
01:17:06,603 --> 01:17:08,671
So, what would you do
to get, like,

1903
01:17:08,705 --> 01:17:11,406
I don't know,
Spielberg to read it?

1904
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,175
(chuckling):
Uh, anything.

1905
01:17:13,208 --> 01:17:15,444
Anything, right?
So, I've been working with this

1906
01:17:15,477 --> 01:17:18,213
really incredible artist on
the side without Grace knowing.

1907
01:17:18,246 --> 01:17:19,916
And I know that Dan
has already committed

1908
01:17:19,949 --> 01:17:21,618
to doing the party on Friday,

1909
01:17:21,651 --> 01:17:24,152
but I need you to help me
<i>Ocean's 11</i> this whole thing

1910
01:17:24,186 --> 01:17:27,255
and get him to drop out at
the last minute, so then I can

1911
01:17:27,289 --> 01:17:29,224
swoop in and I can get
my artist heard

1912
01:17:29,257 --> 01:17:30,559
by Grace and the label,

1913
01:17:30,592 --> 01:17:32,294
and then everyone is
gonna lose their minds...

1914
01:17:32,327 --> 01:17:33,462
clearly,
like I've lost my mind...

1915
01:17:33,495 --> 01:17:37,499
and I'm gonna change the
trajectory of our entire lives.

1916
01:17:37,532 --> 01:17:39,368
Roll credits.

1917
01:17:39,401 --> 01:17:41,536
I love <i>Ocean's 11.</i>

1918
01:17:44,674 --> 01:17:46,776

1919

but she needs a kick in the ass.

best man at
your brother's wedding.

1939

Or in the studio when your
kid's winning the nationals.

01:18:35,892 --> 01:18:40,495

No, four.

Yes.

1943
01:18:43,733 --> 01:18:45,835

Whatever side I'm on.

(laughing)

1972
01:19:53,703 --> 01:19:55,504
- This shit is confusing.
- Jack. Hi. Sorry.

1973
01:19:55,537 --> 01:19:57,405
- Can I just get a quick... One sec.
- Yeah.

1974
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:59,675
Thank you,
'cause he talking about VR.

1975
01:19:59,709 --> 01:20:02,377
Why can't people just take
shrooms like they used to?

1976
01:20:02,410 --> 01:20:05,681
Um, Dan is a no-go.

1977
01:20:06,716 --> 01:20:07,784
What?

1978
01:20:07,817 --> 01:20:08,818
Yeah.

1979
01:20:08,851 --> 01:20:11,053
He's... not able to make it.

1980
01:20:11,087 --> 01:20:13,388
So I have a plan B.

1981
01:20:13,421 --> 01:20:15,323
You said you was
gonna handle this.

1982
01:20:15,357 --> 01:20:17,592
I am. Trust me.

1983

- Where's your guitar?
- It's in the car.

1984
01:20:18,995 --> 01:20:20,395
I thought we were
going to dinner.

1985
01:20:20,428 --> 01:20:22,597
- Why this one? Oh, God.
- What? Why not?

1986
01:20:22,632 --> 01:20:24,967
Okay. Um, I'm gonna need you
to fight the urge

1987
01:20:25,001 --> 01:20:26,736
to get really mad at me
right now.

1988
01:20:26,769 --> 01:20:28,638
Okay.
I mean, what's going on?

1989
01:20:28,671 --> 01:20:32,775
Um, well, there's been
a little change of plans.

1990
01:20:32,809 --> 01:20:34,376
First of all...

1991
01:20:35,044 --> 01:20:36,378
(tapping pants)

1992
01:20:36,411 --> 01:20:37,947
I'm not a producer.

1993
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:39,882
- What?
- I mean, I am,

1994
01:20:39,916 --> 01:20:41,818
but I'm not a real one.

1995
01:20:41,851 --> 01:20:43,485
I'm a personal assistant.

1996
01:20:43,518 --> 01:20:46,388
I'm just... I'm an assistant
to a big-time singer

1997
01:20:46,421 --> 01:20:48,090
who is having
a big party tonight,

1998
01:20:48,124 --> 01:20:50,059
and her whole label
is gonna be there

1999
01:20:50,092 --> 01:20:52,494
and a lot of other music people,

2000
01:20:52,527 --> 01:20:54,831
and you're gonna sing for them.

2001
01:20:54,864 --> 01:20:57,432
That's gr...
That's good, right?

2002
01:20:57,465 --> 01:21:01,070
You're an, um...
you're-you're an assistant?

2003
01:21:01,103 --> 01:21:03,906
(sighs)
Yeah, I am.

2004
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:05,574
I'm an assistant to...

2005
01:21:05,608 --> 01:21:07,375
But my boss, Grace Davis,
is awesome.

2006
01:21:07,409 --> 01:21:08,978
You-you work for Grace Davis?

2007
01:21:09,011 --> 01:21:10,445
Yeah.

2008
01:21:10,478 --> 01:21:12,882
(chuckles, sighs)

2009
01:21:12,915 --> 01:21:14,984
Wow.

2010
01:21:15,017 --> 01:21:16,686
David! Hey, wait.

2011
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:18,386
Does she...
does she know about this?

2012
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:21,724
Um, no, not yet,
but she's gonna love you.

2013
01:21:21,757 --> 01:21:23,125
Do you even have any clients?

2014
01:21:23,159 --> 01:21:25,393
I mean, did you lie
about that, too?

2015
01:21:26,696 --> 01:21:29,397
Oh, my God.

2016
01:21:29,431 --> 01:21:31,399
I'm sorry.
I should have told you.

2017
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:32,969
And I don't...
I'm sorry that I...

2018
01:21:33,002 --> 01:21:35,671
Uh, but we can talk about
all of this later if...

2019
01:21:35,705 --> 01:21:37,607
You know, you're so arrogant.

2020
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:39,041
- (sighs)
- You don't know shit.

2021
01:21:39,075 --> 01:21:40,575
You don't know anything.

2022
01:21:40,610 --> 01:21:41,711
You just walk around
pretending and shit.

2023
01:21:41,744 --> 01:21:43,779
- Like, who does that?
- I'm sorry that I lied to you.

2024
01:21:43,813 --> 01:21:47,049
It was wrong, but I...
we made something really good,

2025
01:21:47,083 --> 01:21:48,117
and it deserves a shot.

2026
01:21:48,150 --> 01:21:49,417
I think you deserve a shot.

2027
01:21:49,451 --> 01:21:51,187
And do you know what's in there?

2028
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:52,520
That could change
your whole life.

2029
01:21:52,554 --> 01:21:54,090
It could change
both of our lives.

2030
01:21:54,123 --> 01:21:55,958
I'm not your escape plan,
Maggie.

2031
01:21:55,992 --> 01:21:57,927
That's... (sighs)

2032

That's not what I...

I was pissed

because you messed up
and you didn't do your job.

supposed to do?

No, no, no.
I have, actually, more to say.

I trusted you,

2292
01:35:18,393 --> 01:35:22,230
and I have never trusted
an assistant like that before.

2293
01:35:22,264 --> 01:35:23,666
Do not tell Gail.

2295
01:35:25,467 --> 01:35:28,303
But you were very good
at your job.

And you worked harder than...

2297

(laughing):
anyone else ever has,

2298
01:35:32,008 --> 01:35:33,341
and you loved it, and...

2299
01:35:33,375 --> 01:35:35,011

Maggie, that's not
why I came here.

that the work you did on
the live album was very good.

- Really?
- Yes.

2307
01:35:57,499 --> 01:35:58,735
I would have filled in
the audience track

2308
01:35:58,768 --> 01:36:00,837
a little bit more,
and I think you overmixed

01:36:00,870 --> 01:36:02,304
- in some places.
- Okay.

2310

01:38:23,179 --> 01:38:24,479
David?

2360
01:38:24,512 --> 01:38:26,816
- Um, this is...
- Mom?

2361
01:38:26,849 --> 01:38:27,884
What are you doing here?

2362
01:38:27,917 --> 01:38:28,550
"Mom"?

2363
01:38:28,583 --> 01:38:30,152
Did you send Dan the songs?

2364
01:38:30,186 --> 01:38:32,688
Oh, sweetheart,
are you recording?

2365
01:38:32,722 --> 01:38:34,857
Sorry.
Did you just call her "Mom"?

2366
01:38:34,891 --> 01:38:36,192
Are you his mom?

2367
01:38:36,225 --> 01:38:37,727
Not now, Margaret.

2368
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:39,862
Yeah, I've been working
on some stuff with Maggie.

2369
01:38:39,896 --> 01:38:41,998
- Oh.
- And Dan showed his label the tracks,

2370
01:38:42,031 --> 01:38:43,900
and they want to sign me.

2371
01:38:43,933 --> 01:38:45,768
So, wait, you...

2372
01:38:45,801 --> 01:38:50,106
you were working with him
while you were working for me?

2373
01:38:50,139 --> 01:38:51,741
Is this the guy... Are you...

2374
01:38:51,774 --> 01:38:52,675
Is this...

2375
01:38:52,708 --> 01:38:54,476
(whispers):
Is this the boy?

2376
01:38:56,478 --> 01:38:59,048
(gasps)
Are you two dating?

2377
01:38:59,081 --> 01:39:00,515
- MAGGIE: No.
- DAVID: Yeah.

2378
01:39:00,548 --> 01:39:03,953
Hey, Magpie, I got some tacos.

2379
01:39:03,986 --> 01:39:06,022
Wow. It's, uh...

2380
01:39:07,156 --> 01:39:08,758
It's Grace Davis.

2381
01:39:08,791 --> 01:39:10,458
That's me.

2382
01:39:10,492 --> 01:39:11,894
(chuckles softly)

2383
01:39:11,928 --> 01:39:13,595
Uh...

2384
01:39:13,629 --> 01:39:15,597
you came on the ferry?

2385
01:39:15,631 --> 01:39:17,599
- No, I have a helicopter.
- (scoffs) Wow.

2386
01:39:17,633 --> 01:39:19,635
- I do.
- (scoffs): Yeah.

2387
01:39:19,669 --> 01:39:21,938
- I have a helicopter.
- Tell everybody.

2388
01:39:21,971 --> 01:39:23,538
MAGGIE:
<i>So...</i>

2389
01:39:23,571 --> 01:39:25,041
when you said that
you and your mom

2390
01:39:25,074 --> 01:39:26,776
just started talking again,

2391
01:39:26,809 --> 01:39:30,880
you didn't think to tell me
that your mom is Grace Davis?

2392
01:39:30,913 --> 01:39:32,815
You didn't tell me
you were working for her.

2393
01:39:32,848 --> 01:39:34,482
Oh, don't change the subject.

2394
01:39:40,056 --> 01:39:41,791
We've met before.

2395
01:39:43,192 --> 01:39:48,230
1989, I interviewed you for
my radio show on K-SADJ, and...

2396
01:39:48,264 --> 01:39:50,565
- It was in L.A.
- Yes.

2397
01:39:50,598 --> 01:39:51,701
Downtown.

2398
01:39:51,734 --> 01:39:54,070
I can't believe
you remember that.

2399
01:39:54,103 --> 01:39:55,871
- Yes.
- (Max laughing)

2400
01:39:55,905 --> 01:39:57,206
Oh, my God. Wait.

2401
01:39:57,239 --> 01:39:58,808
- Yeah.
- You had long hair.

2402
01:39:58,841 --> 01:40:00,109
You didn't have the-the beard.

2403
01:40:00,142 --> 01:40:02,178
- Yeah, okay.
- And that voice.

2404
01:40:02,211 --> 01:40:04,113
That's you! (laughs)

2405
01:40:04,146 --> 01:40:05,715
That was a really good show.

2406
01:40:05,748 --> 01:40:07,216
I think it was. Yeah.

2407
01:40:07,249 --> 01:40:08,884
And you had a pregnant wife.

2408
01:40:08,918 --> 01:40:10,286
Yeah. Yeah.

2409
01:40:10,319 --> 01:40:11,921
- Yeah.
- She used to help me.

2410
01:40:11,954 --> 01:40:13,055
And that was Maggie.

2411
01:40:13,089 --> 01:40:14,223
What-what...

2412
01:40:14,256 --> 01:40:15,624
The one inside
the pregnant wife.

2413
01:40:15,658 --> 01:40:18,094
- (gasps)
- Small world.

2414
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:22,765
Fucking long con.

2415
01:40:28,037 --> 01:40:30,606
I had him when I was so young.

2416
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:32,875
And I had a chance

2417
01:40:32,908 --> 01:40:36,746
to change things for us,
and I took it.

2418
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:40,616
I took it.

2419
01:40:42,651 --> 01:40:44,920
Who else knows?

2420
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:52,661
Gail.

2421
01:40:54,764 --> 01:40:56,132
Jack.

2422
01:40:58,267 --> 01:41:01,103
He was there when I had him.

2423
01:41:01,137 --> 01:41:02,338
Jack's always there.

2424
01:41:02,371 --> 01:41:03,706
I don't... I just don't...

2425
01:41:03,739 --> 01:41:06,108
How-how did this...

2426
01:41:06,142 --> 01:41:09,645
I know everything about you.
I mean...

2427
01:41:09,678 --> 01:41:12,148
I have really good lawyers.

2428
01:41:12,181 --> 01:41:14,183
Like...

2429
01:41:14,216 --> 01:41:16,318
- Damn.
- Mm.

2430
01:41:16,352 --> 01:41:18,287
Are you gonna tell people?

2431
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,322
I wanted to.

2432
01:41:20,356 --> 01:41:22,792
Many times.

2433
01:41:22,825 --> 01:41:25,327
But he said he wasn't ready.

2434
01:41:25,361 --> 01:41:29,899
And after everything I put him
through, I... I respect that.

2435
01:41:29,932 --> 01:41:32,168
I wanted to help him
with his music.

2436
01:41:32,201 --> 01:41:36,605
But he was worried that people
wouldn't take him seriously

2437
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:38,941
if I was involved,
which I understand.

2438
01:41:38,974 --> 01:41:42,745
It must have been really,
really hard for you.

2439
01:41:42,778 --> 01:41:45,047
- Yeah.
- For you both. I mean...

2440
01:41:46,682 --> 01:41:48,851
Mostly him.

2441
01:41:50,319 --> 01:41:54,990
There's a lot of things
I wish I had done differently.

2442
01:41:55,024 --> 01:41:57,026
We're here now.

2443
01:42:04,266 --> 01:42:06,902
He's really good, Grace.

- Oh, my God. That was amazing.
- Oh, my God.

This is so crazy.
This is so crazy.

2452

So, uh, before we go,
we've got a surprise for y'all.

Oh, my God.

2458

- Is he talking about you?
- No.

2459
01:42:43,239 --> 01:42:45,274
And she happens to be

2460
01:42:45,307 --> 01:42:47,776
a really great singer.

2461
01:42:47,810 --> 01:42:49,178

2462

- Okay.
- Yep.

2464
01:42:51,447 --> 01:42:52,748
- Hold my phone.
- Got it. Yep.

2465
01:42:52,781 --> 01:42:54,283
- Excuse me, Margaret.
- Whoa.

2466

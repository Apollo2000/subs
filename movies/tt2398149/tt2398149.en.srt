2
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,639
Soldiers!

3
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,279
Present arms!

4
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,399
Commence!

5
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,639
"In the name of the French people,

6
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,359
the first War Council of the
military government of Paris

7
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:44,599
on December 22, 1894 found Dreyfus Alfred,

8
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,759
Captain of the 14th Artillery Regiment,

9
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,999
staff trainee, guilty of high treason.

10
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,639
It therefore condemns him
to be deported to a fortified place,

11
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,799
and to military degradation."

12
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,859
Alfred Dreyfus,
you are no longer worthy to bear arms.

13
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,879
In the name of the French people,
we degrade you.

14
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,199
Soldiers!

15
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,399
They degrade an innocent man!

16
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,439
They dishonour an innocent man!
Long live France!

17
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,439
- Long live the army!
- To death!

18
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,039
- To death!
- Traitor!

19
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,639
- To death!
- Death to the Jew!

20
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,919
You're a traitor!

21
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,119
Picquart, how does he look?

22
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,759
Like a Jewish tailor,
crying over the gold he lost.

23
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,759
Kill the traitor!

24
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,599
To death!

25
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,319
- Coward!
- To death!

26
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,599
Damn you!

27
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,799
- To death!
- Damn you, traitor!

28
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,879
- To death!
- Traitor!

29
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,919
I am innocent!

30
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,999
The Romans threw the Christians
to the lions, we the Jews. We progress.

31
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,279
What was the mood
at the end of the ceremony?

32
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,759
As if a healthy body
had been purged of a plague

33
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,779
and life would resume its course.

34
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,559
Too bad, the Minister of War
cannot assist in these events.

35
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,959
- Am I being sued?
- No, Minister.

36
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,039
It doesn't matter. You did well.

37
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,679
We were impressed with your
conduct. Right, Boisdeffre?

38
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,679
Indeed.
Colonel Sandherr witnessed the ceremony?

39
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,999
- He was there, General.
- His tremors?

40
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,399
He could control them.

41
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,599
His condition won't improve.

42
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,439
You will replace him.

43
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,639
With all due respect, I don't have
experience in the secret service.

44
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,719
You'll have to acquire it.

45
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,199
The punishment given to Dreyfus
will show the world how we treat traitors.

46
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,239
I want to send him to a place
where he has no one to talk to.

47
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,079
- The penal colony of Cayenne?
- No, better yet.

48
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,839
A deserted rock where he'll be alone,
Devil's Island.

49
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,019
Are they still talking
about that damn Jew?

50
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,399
Picquart. You knew him, didn't you?

51
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,919
- Sorry, who?
- Dreyfus.

52
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,119
He was my student at the War College.

53
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,599
- They treat him like that because he's Jewish?
- Yes. I am a lawyer.

54
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,439
A Catholic officer
would have had a fair trial.

55
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,559
Do you agree, Picquart?

56
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,719
He was denied due process
on matters of national security

57
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,879
that could not be disclosed, but the
evidence against him was not lacking.

58
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,159
I forgot!

59
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,519
With Philippe I discovered an
alsacian restaurant in Rue Marbeuf.

60
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,399
- Wonderful.
- Great restaurant.

61
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,079
I'll prove it.

62
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,839
- Major!
- Captain.

63
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,159
Major, did I do something to offend you?

64
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,399
No.

65
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,839
You're the only professor
who gave me a bad grade.

66
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,759
Perhaps I don't value your skills
as much as you do.

67
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,399
Not because I'm Jewish?

68
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,599
I'm careful that sentiment
doesn't affect my judgment.

69
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,279
If you have to be careful,
it's a plausible hypothesis.

70
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,639
If you're asking me if I
appreciate Jews, my answer is no.

71
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,759
If you're implying that
I have a discriminating attitude

72
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,679
I assure you I don't.

73
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,879
Never.

74
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,239
It was a beautiful day.
Are you tired?

75
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,439
A little, but I had a great time.

76
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,839
- Georges, I'll help you.
- Come on, darling.

77
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,999
He's going to Brussels on Wednesday.

78
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,919
- Can you come?
- Yes.

79
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,239
Do you ever feel guilty?

80
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,159
- He's not my husband.
- You know what I mean.

81
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,159
Why guilty?
You were with me before he showed up.

82
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,479
I don't understand why you married him.

83
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,399
He asked me.

84
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,319
You don't.

85
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,319
You think he knows about us?

86
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,239
No.

87
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,239
- Why?
- If he knew, he'd kill me.

88
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,239
- Are you sure he's in Brussels?
- That's what he said.

89
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,239
- Who is it?
- Telegram.

90
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,479
- Major Picquart?
- Yes.

91
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,599
Thank you.

92
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,039
- It's from General Gonse.
- Who is he?

93
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,519
He's the head of the Secret Service.

94
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,599
- He wants to see me in the morning.
- Darling! Are you in trouble?

95
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,839
I prayed that this day would never come.

96
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,679
Colonel Sandherr can no longer
head the Statistics section.

97
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,359
I'm sorry to hear that.

98
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,359
From now on, you will take his place.

99
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,399
You will be promoted to Lieutenant Colonel.

100
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,079
That makes you the youngest
Colonel in the army.

101
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,039
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

102
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,079
Keep me in the loop.

103
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,399
Understand, young man?
I hate surprises.

104
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,559
Major Henry will show you the offices.

105
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,799
Did he expect to get this assignment?

106
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,119
My God, no! Too crude.
His wife's father is a landlord, I think.

107
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,479
- You're not married?
- No, General.

108
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,399
- Is there a reason?
- No.

109
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,279
Is there anything that
could expose you to blackmail?

110
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,839
No.

111
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,119
I have to ask, you understand.

112
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,719
Major Henry, come in.

113
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,799
- General.
- Colonel Picquart

114
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,599
will head the Statistics section.

115
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,919
- Welcome him.
- Certainly, General.

116
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,119
Colonel.

117
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,679
Here we go.

118
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,599
- I thought it was uninhabited.
- Nobody's bothering us here.

119
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,879
I don't doubt it.

120
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,839
Bachir!

121
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,719
Good morning, Major.

122
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,239
Colonel Picquart
takes command of the section.

123
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,399
Bachir knows every secret here.

124
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,599
- Is that so?
- Yes.

125
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,599
What's all this racket?
You can hear it from the street.

126
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,119
Stop it!

127
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,519
Police officers, informants.
They're useful.

128
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,599
Colonel Sandherr made them
stay here to check them out.

129
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,479
- What's that smell?
- Tell me about it, the sewers.

130
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,199
The whole neighborhood stinks.

131
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,799
Meet Captains Junck and Valdant.

132
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,599
- What are they doing?
- Checking the correspondence.

133
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,559
Valdant uses the dry method,
Junck uses steam.

134
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,199
- Are these private letters?
- Not anymore.

135
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,959
At ease, Captain.

136
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,039
You remember Captain Lauth
of the Dreyfus affair.

137
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,439
Colonel Picquart is the new chief.

138
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,839
What are you doing?

139
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,639
I'll tell you later.

140
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,919
You may also remember
Gribelin, the archivist.

141
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,919
Colonel Picquart replaces Sandherr.

142
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,399
You have a lot of files.

143
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,879
All right, carry on.

144
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,319
Here's the telephone
and here's my office.

145
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,199
No secretaries,
the Colonel didn't trust them.

146
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,599
This was his office.

147
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,239
- So now it's mine.
- We'll have to get used to it.

148
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,839
Here are your keys.
Entrance, office, drawer, safe.

149
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,119
Thank you. What was Lauth working on?

150
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,599
Recomposing the correspondence
of the German military attaché.

151
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,479
- Colonel Schwartzkoppen.
- Private letters?

152
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,839
Yes.

153
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,039
- Does the Minister know about this?
- Certainly.

154
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,359
We follow his stories with pleasure.
He's been having an affair for years.

155
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,999
- Is that so strange?
- Yes, it is.

156
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,519
He's mad at the Italian military attaché,
Major Panizzardi.

157
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,119
Good gracious!

158
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,199
How do we get his letters?

159
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,439
Come on, I'm the section chief.

160
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,279
The cleaning lady at the
German Embassy, Marie Bastian.

161
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,039
Every week she delivers us
the contents of the garbage can.

162
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:03,199
They are important documents,
not just affected notes.

163
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,559
Remember this?

164
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,079
- Dreyfus' note.
- It was in six pieces.

165
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,199
Lauth glued them together
and removed the tear marks.

166
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,759
So you can't tell where it came from.
Without this, we wouldn't have caught him.

167
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,599
Good job.

168
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,199
We framed it for Sandherr
when they demoted the traitor.

169
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,239
Good. Thank you, Major.

170
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,839
- I think we'll get along just fine.
- Thank you, Colonel. I hope so.

171
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,599
"I send you some interesting information.

172
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,399
A note on the hydraulic brake
of the 120 and its functioning.

173
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,039
A note on the cover troops.

174
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,679
One on the changes to artillery units.

175
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:08,479
The Artillery Field Manual, Firing.
March 1894."

176
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,320
May I?

177
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,919
We recovered this one week ago
at the German Embassy.

178
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:21,159
- Where are the documents mentioned?
- Probably in Berlin.

179
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,359
Who's the spy?

180
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,879
What does the note say?

181
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,759
He's an artillery officer.

182
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,759
He served in all four
departments of the Joint Chiefs.

183
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:40,559
The only ones to have done this are your
students at the War College.

184
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,839
- I'm surprised there's a traitor.
- One of them is.

185
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,519
We'd like a sample
of each officer's handwriting

186
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,519
- who carried out this rotation.
- Certainly.

187
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,959
The gunners who served
in the four departments.

188
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,439
Souriau. Gaston. Corbin.

189
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,119
Dreyfus. Etienne. Dreyfus...

190
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,879
- The Jew?
- He's the only Jew among them.

191
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,839
Could it be him?

192
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,679
It may very well be him.
Better show it to Du Paty.

193
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,119
Major Du Paty?
Is he in charge of this?

194
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,639
Yes, Major Du Paty
is a passionate investigator.

195
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,599
Picquart, get Dreyfus in here.

196
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,599
Henry, hide behind the map.

197
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,719
I'll pretend I hurt my finger.

198
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,759
I'll ask him to write a letter
that I will dictate to him.

199
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,439
Cochefert, you and your colleague
be seated. Take the chair.

200
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,519
You'll be sitting here
to make the arrest.

201
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,839
Gribelin, take notes.

202
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,559
So...

203
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,839
When he confesses...

204
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,719
I'll propose to him to accept
the only honourable solution.

205
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,559
- He's at the entrance.
- Picquart, go.

206
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,279
Get in position. Good luck gentlemen.

207
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,519
- Good morning, Major.
- Captain.

208
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,279
Forgive my attire.

209
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,839
I'm called to a meeting
of the Joint Chiefs.

210
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,439
- "In bourgeois clothes."
- Exactly.

211
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,039
What a relief!

212
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,279
- I thought it was a joke.
- It's not a joke. I'll come with you.

213
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,519
- Don't bother.
- I insist.

214
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,559
It's very quiet, isn't it?

215
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,999
Good. Now I have to say goodbye.

216
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,639
Goodbye, Major.

217
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,199
Enter.

218
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,159
- Mrs. Sandherr?
- Yes.

219
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,759
I am Colonel Picquart,
your husband's successor.

220
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,760
You have his job. What do you want?

221
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,519
- Leave us alone.
- Who is it?

222
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,759
- Picquart.
- I summoned him. Send him in.

223
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,039
- Good morning, Colonel.
- Come closer, Picquart.

224
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,039
I have a few things
that will come in handy.

225
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,959
In the desk, down there.

226
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,359
There's something you must have.

227
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,759
Down there.

228
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,119
The bag, open it.

229
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,839
Secret funds, 48,000 francs.
It's yours now.

230
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,759
In the middle drawer
of the desk is a folder.

231
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,959
You see it?

232
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,719
Yes, it's here.

233
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,639
- Who are they?
- People suspected of treason.

234
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,319
People to arrest in case of war.

235
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,919
- All of them?
- Yes, 2,500 names.

236
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,359
Gribelin has the master list.

237
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,639
A hundred thousand foreigners to arrest.

238
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,159
- Good gracious!
- That's not all, there are no Jews.

239
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,679
My wife says it's shameful to retire.

240
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,479
But I'm happy to be forgotten.

241
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,079
When I see so many foreigners around me

242
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,999
I notice the degeneration of the
our moral and artistic values.

243
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,999
Then I realize I cannot recognize France.

244
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,319
- I will try to protect the country.
- Go ahead, for what's left of it!

245
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,279
Colonel.

246
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,279
Good day, Bachir.

247
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,879
- Good day, Colonel.
- Sorry to disturb you.

248
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,999
Major Henry! A word, if you please.

249
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,159
Colonel. You're early.

250
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,639
- Some changes will have to be made.
- Changes?

251
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,839
I don't want these shady types in here.
We'll replace the passes.

252
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,719
- And Bachir is exasperating.
- You're getting rid of Bachir?

253
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,719
He'll get another assignment.
Meantime, let's get a doorbell.

254
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,639
- Very well, Colonel.
- What's in the bag?

255
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,439
Marie Bastian's lastest delivery.

256
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,119
- From when?
- Last night.

257
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,399
She leaves it at a church near my house.

258
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,039
- You take it home?
- It's just my wife and me.

259
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,599
That's not why. Documents like that
need to be brought here right away.

260
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,079
I'll keep them in the safe.

261
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,319
I'll decide which leads to follow
and to whom to entrust the task.

262
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,199
Sandherr was happy with my work.

263
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,239
Sandherr is consumed by syphilis.

264
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,879
He is paralysed and brain damaged.

265
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,439
That'll be all.

266
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,199
Very well, Colonel.

267
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:49,319
One last thing.
I will pick up the next delivery myself.

268
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,399
- Well?
- It's a telegram.

269
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,679
"I look forward to
a more detailed explanation

270
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,959
than the one you gave me the other day
on the outstanding issue.

271
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:48,599
Please give it to me in writing
to see if I can continue my..."

272
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,239
- My...?
- "my relationship.

273
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,839
My relationship with the house of R."

274
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,999
He didn't send it.
There's the address on the back.

275
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,839
"Mr. Major Esterhazy.
Rue de la Bienfaisance.

276
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:29,119
Walsin Esterhazy, 74th Infantry
Regiment stationed in Rouen."

277
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,879
Rouen.

278
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,359
"The house of R."
Is there another traitor?

279
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:43,079
I want a list of more trustworthy
inspectors, someone discreet.

280
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,359
- I'll ask Major Henry.
- No.

281
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:50,879
It'll stay between us.
For now we won't tell anyone about this.

282
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,239
- Colonel Picquart?
- Yes.

283
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,679
- Jean Alfred Desvernine of security.
- Perfect.

284
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,079
I have an assignment for you,
a delicate matter.

285
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,559
There's a name inside.

286
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,079
I want to know everything about him.
How he lives, who he hangs out with.

287
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,999
Particularly if he has relations
with the German Embassy.

288
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,519
It's a delicate matter.
Don't come to the ministry.

289
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,999
- How long will you need?
- Give me a week.

290
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,439
- "Apollo." Is that Greek?
- No, it's a Roman copy.

291
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:59,279
- The original is lost.
- You mean it's a fake.

292
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,399
No, it's a copy. It's different.

293
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,079
- I'd rather have told you myself.
- It doesn't matter.

294
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,919
I asked Lauth not to tell anyone.

295
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,159
- Maybe nobody believes me.
- Who says otherwise?

296
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,679
- Can I give you some advice?
- Certainly.

297
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,199
Newcomers think that the first suspect

298
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,479
they meet is a great spy.

299
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,039
Esterhazy is stuck in Rouen, he doesn't
have access to confidential material.

300
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,119
He's small fry.

301
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,239
Judging from this,
Schwartzkoppen also doesn't consider it.

302
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,879
Keep an eye on him,
but don't waste too much time on it.

303
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,999
Thanks for the advice.

304
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,919
There he is.

305
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,159
- I'm assuming it's not the wife.
- No.

306
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,159
Marguerite Pays,
prostitute, 26 years old.

307
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,439
- She's known as Four Finger Margaret.
- You're joking.

308
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,719
No.

309
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,599
He settled her
in an apartment in Montmartre.

310
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,479
I thought he was stationed in Rouen.

311
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,639
- He never goes there.
- Never?

312
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,639
A curious detail.
He always enrolled in artillery classes.

313
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,119
But he's not in the artillery.

314
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,519
We'd better get going.

315
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,199
What's the next move?

316
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,519
Opposite the German Embassy is a building.

317
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,919
There's an empty apartment for rent.

318
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,399
The Germans use the ground floor
as a canteen for officers.

319
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,679
We should get some material over there.
It'll be risky and expensive.

320
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,519
- Isn't it enough to follow Esterhazy?
- You've seen him, he's cunning.

321
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,319
He'd know right away.

322
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,559
- Rent the apartment.
- Yes.

323
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,439
- Good day.
- Colonel.

324
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,759
Schwartzkoppen is with Panizzardi,
the Italian military attaché.

325
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,919
You come at just the right time.

326
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,519
Here's Schwartzkoppen.

327
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,839
Here is Panizzardi Alessandro.
He's a handsome young man.

328
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,399
The Ambassador, Count Munster...

329
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,199
and diplomats and officers
that we haven't identified yet.

330
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,159
- Isn't Esterhazy there?
- No.

331
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,719
Colonel, they're leaving.

332
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,799
My God! They're in love.

333
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,759
Gentlemen,
what you are about to see is secret.

334
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,559
Our cannons were firing
two rounds per minute.

335
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,399
Today I present to you Cannon 75.

336
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,359
It has a hydropneumatic brake
that absorbs the energy of the shot.

337
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,359
This avoids recalculating
the aim after the hit.

338
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:23,879
- So the firing rate has increased tenfold.
- Gunners, to your stations!

339
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,119
For a 12-shot. Load up.

340
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,519
- Loader ready.
- Shooter ready.

341
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,839
Fire!

342
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,839
If the Germans come back
we will give them a warm welcome.

343
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,359
To the 75!

344
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,999
Colonel Picquart?

345
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,199
- Yes.
- Colonel Foucault.

346
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,999
I'm the military attaché in Berlin.
Do you have a moment?

347
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,799
Yes.

348
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,999
- It will play a decisive role in battle.
- I'm sure.

349
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,119
You know about the infiltrator
in the German secret service?

350
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,959
- Cuers?
- Cuers.

351
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,119
He says the Germans have a spy in our army.

352
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,199
- Did he mention a name?
- He doesn't know.

353
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,879
He's 50 years old and commands a battalion.

354
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,799
For two years he's been passing
second-rate information

355
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,239
especially about artillery.

356
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,119
I wanted to fill you in.

357
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,759
Thanks, I'll take care of it.

358
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,799
A toast is in order.

359
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,639
- Cheers!
- Here's to us.

360
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,919
Well? What's so urgent?

361
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:41,359
- Interesting.
- It's interesting what he's holding.

362
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,079
- A cane?
- No, this.

363
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,319
- How long between the two pictures?
- Twelve minutes.

364
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,479
- He takes no precautions.
- He doesn't care.

365
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,919
My goodness, what they get up to nowadays!

366
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,319
- What does General Gonse say?
- I haven't told him yet.

367
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,399
- Why?
- I wanted to restrict it

368
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,479
to a limited circle of people.

369
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,479
- I would like to inform the minister.
- Why?

370
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,679
War Secretary Billot
asked to warn him about things

371
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,999
- that might create political problems.
- All right, you can talk to him about it.

372
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,999
But be discreet.
I don't want another Dreyfus scandal.

373
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,999
Esterhazy... Esterhazy...

374
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,159
That name sounds familiar.

375
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,599
Have you met him?

376
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,839
Evokes memories in my old head.

377
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,159
Minister.

378
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,199
Consult the registers
about... What's the name?

379
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:59,039
Marie Charles Ferdinand Walsin
Esterhazy, 74th Infantry.

380
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,479
- How will you proceed?
- It's not easy.

381
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,239
Except for the pictures,
we have an unsent telegram

382
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,919
and unusable chatter of an agent in Berlin.

383
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,479
So... You need to find the evidence.

384
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,239
- Shall we open an inquiry?
- Sure.

385
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,239
Boisdeffre doesn't want
more Dreyfus scandals.

386
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,519
The scandal is not to punish him.

387
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,599
Minister,
Esterhazy has written twice this summer.

388
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,839
Well, look at that!

389
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:35,719
"I request a transfer from Rouen
to the General Staff of Paris."

390
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,999
- The impudence!
- He wants to discover secrets

391
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,959
- and make a lot of money. Can I have them?
- Yes.

392
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,960
Thank you.

393
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,559
Name and occupation.

394
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,319
Alphonse Bertillon, head of the
Judicial Identity Service.

395
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,559
You are a handwriting expert.

396
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,639
You compared the note
addressed to the foreign embassy

397
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,559
- with the defendant's handwriting.
- Yes.

398
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,199
You have no doubt that they
are written by the same person.

399
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,159
I have no doubt.

400
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,999
There are similarities, but also
many differences. The O's, the double S's.

401
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:37,039
- You say so yourself.
- Yes, but they're deliberate.

402
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,959
It's a self-forgery operation.

403
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:46,079
The note was written
on extremely thin paper.

404
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:51,799
Like this one. You don't write letters
on paper like this. It allows...

405
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:56,039
I'm sorry, may I?
Allows to have perfect transparency.

406
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:01,199
So to use a model under
which I could copy it.

407
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,079
There is one word in particular.

408
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,999
That's the word "interest."

409
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,519
I've reproduced it
with a five millimetre grid

410
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:19,079
and a 12.5 millimeter template.
Notice the overlapping edges.

411
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:24,199
It's an overlapping of letters
by 1.25 millimeter.

412
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:29,319
Here we see an even more
detailed enlargement of the word.

413
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,359
What do we notice?
Every time you see a discrepancy.

414
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,359
The difference is 1.25 millimeters.

415
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,239
It's impossible for a hand

416
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:45,119
which performs natural handwriting
to reproduce an identical track.

417
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,199
It's a case of one in a million.

418
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,039
So I say that Dreyfus
forged the handwriting

419
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,359
in case it would be discovered...

420
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,399
You're saying I am guilty
because the handwriting is mine.

421
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,599
Yes.

422
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,959
But I'm equally guilty
if the handwriting isn't mine.

423
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,639
Yes.

424
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,119
Major, what will you tell the minister?

425
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,679
The chances of conviction
are not more than 50%.

426
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,239
Why?

427
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,799
What motive could he have?
It can't be money.

428
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,359
His personal resources are
20 times a captain's pay.

429
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,439
You haven't found a motive.

430
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,079
You should see the evidence
we have against that Jew.

431
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:34,319
In a letter, an officer
calls him "that scumbag D."

432
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:39,159
- "Scoundrel D." Then use it.
- Betray our secret source?

433
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,599
- They are closed hearings.
- Dreyfus and his lawyer are here.

434
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:49,399
What if I describe the contents
of our files in court?

435
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,039
You've already given your statement.

436
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,099
- If you spoke to the President of the Court?
- With all due respect,

437
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,919
I'm here to observe,
not to intervene.

438
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,839
Then I'll take care of it.

439
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:09,959
The Court has been informed that
your deposition was incomplete.

440
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:13,679
I didn't want to reveal
any secret information.

441
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,999
- Now you can reveal it.
- If the court insists, I will.

442
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,199
In March, a highly respected person...

443
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,959
An extremely estimable person
informed us of a traitor

444
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,239
who was transmitting secrets
to a foreign power.

445
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,399
In June, he reiterated the report
in a more precise fashion.

446
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,479
Carry on, Major.

447
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,759
The traitor he named is that man.

448
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,559
Stay calm.

449
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,399
- Do you swear this is true?
- I swear.

450
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,759
The statement has no value
without the witness.

451
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,479
Can you state the name?

452
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,999
- Impossible.
- Secrets are well guarded here.

453
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,719
An officer has secrets
that not even his kepi knows.

454
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,039
Major Henry concluded
the deposition thus.

455
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,679
Was it decisive?

456
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,999
- It certainly was spectacular.
- But not decisive.

457
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,599
He was speaking from hearsay.

458
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:24,919
The Statistics section has a file
containing evidence against Dreyfus.

459
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,679
According to them,
the judges should see it.

460
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,239
I agree.

461
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,079
Of course Dreyfus and
his lawyer can't see it.

462
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:41,519
- It will be reserved for judges.
- That's a breach of procedure.

463
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:45,719
Theoretically, yes, but it's vital
that the judges see it.

464
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,799
In the name of truth and justice.

465
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,359
You understand, Major Picquart?

466
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,959
Mr. Minister.

467
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,439
Colonel.

468
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,479
"In the name of the French people,

469
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,239
The first War Council of the
military government of Paris

470
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,199
has issued the following judgment.

471
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:59,319
Today, December 22, 1894,
the first War Council of Paris,

472
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:03,079
having heard the indictments and
conclusions of the government commissioner,

473
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,159
declares the defendant Dreyfus Alfred,

474
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,239
Captain of the 14th Artillery Regiment,

475
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,839
intern at the Joint Chiefs,
guilty as charged.

476
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:19,719
In 1894 he passed on
to agents of a foreign power

477
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:25,319
classified or confidential documents
regarding national defense.

478
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,119
He also exchanged
information with this power

479
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:36,239
to provide such power with
the means to perform hostile acts."

480
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,399
I thought you'd forgotten about me.

481
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,759
- Because you forgot me.
- Absolutely not.

482
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,679
Philippe won't be back tonight.

483
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,119
- Remember?
- Of course, my dear.

484
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,159
I've been thinking about it for weeks.

485
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,559
- I'll make you dinner.
- You're kind.

486
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:29,159
"What a horrible nightmare I've been living
for almost two years, my dear Lucie.

487
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:33,039
The guards are forbidden
to speak to me.

488
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,079
The days go by
without me talking to anyone.

489
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,839
The isolation is such that it
feels like I am buried alive.

490
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,239
If it were just for me, I would have
already slipped into the grave.

491
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:53,679
But it's not just about my life,
but my honor,

492
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,999
the honor of us all,
of our children's lives.

493
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:03,919
Lately they've been grilling me
every night. I don't know why.

494
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,259
It's not a precautionary measure.

495
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,299
It's a form of hatred.

496
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,059
It's a kind of torture."

497
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,659
Georges!

498
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,759
Sorry, I couldn't sleep.

499
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,119
- How long have you been there?
- Quite a while.

500
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:45,919
Are those letters? Love letters?

501
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:52,079
It doesn't matter.
I can't hope for fidelity.

502
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,219
It's nothing, I assure you.

503
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,039
- Is it just work?
- Yes, it's just work.

504
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,759
Hurry up.

505
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,479
Fifteen, Eight.

506
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,479
Sir.

507
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,679
- Colonel Picquart.
- Bertillon.

508
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,679
I replaced Sandherr
at the Statistics section.

509
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,959
I know.

510
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,839
What can I do for you?

511
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:37,079
I have these papers.
I'd like to know what you think.

512
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:41,039
- I never give an immediate opinion.
- Maybe in this case you will.

513
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,499
Yes, it looks the same.

514
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Yes.

515
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,639
Of course!

516
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,399
It's the same, yes.

517
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,399
Well?

518
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,279
Are they the same?

519
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:17,839
The handwriting is identical
to the note of Dreyfus.

520
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,399
Would you be willing
to state that in writing?

521
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,839
Of course, if you wish.

522
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:28,239
What if I told you that
this wasn't written by Dreyfus?

523
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:33,799
I'd say that the Jews
have taught someone to write

524
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,359
with the handwriting of Dreyfus.

525
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,239
I want to see the Dreyfus file.

526
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,039
- Major Henry has it.
- He is on leave.

527
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,439
Indeed.

528
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,439
Then give it to me.

529
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,879
Won't you wait for the major to return?

530
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,799
Why are you questioning my orders?
Find the file.

531
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,559
- Is that all?
- Yes.

532
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,359
The War Council hasn't touched it since.

533
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,359
"My dear friend...

534
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,619
I enclose twelve guiding plans for Nice

535
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:46,659
that that scumbag D gave to me for you.

536
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:53,079
He said he'll do his best
to please you. Alexandrine?

537
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,279
Don't fuck too much."

538
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,199
I'd like to talk to you.

539
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,699
- Is it urgent?
- If it's not too much trouble.

540
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,719
Leave us.

541
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:29,199
- Thank you for your time.
- Always a pleasure, Picquart.

542
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,639
But I'm busy with the preparations
for the Tsar's visit.

543
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,679
What's so urgent?

544
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,279
The case I told you about days ago.

545
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,959
Major Esterhazy.

546
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,999
Esterhazy?

547
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,719
Can I make some room?

548
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,879
- Sure.
- Thank you.

549
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,399
You know these already.

550
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,919
Goodness gracious! What is all this?

551
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,839
We have a serious problem, General.
The sooner we solve it, the better.

552
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:19,319
Esterhazy wrote to get a transfer.
I got them from the minister.

553
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:23,319
I noticed the resemblance of the
handwriting with the document

554
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,939
which has proven Dreyfus guilty.

555
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,639
I showed them to Bertillon,
the graphologist.

556
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,799
- Remember?
- Yes.

557
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,159
It confirms that
the handwriting is identical.

558
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:42,279
I've reviewed the secret file
of the evidence provided to the judges

559
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,839
who presided over the court-martial.

560
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,439
No, wait.

561
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:51,839
- The secret file still exists?
- Yes, here it is.

562
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:59,199
I was surprised
by the fragility of this evidence.

563
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:04,959
Only one letter alludes to Dreyfus
and it also has the initial "D."

564
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,279
All this should have been destroyed.

565
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:19,239
Mercier had told Sandherr
to get rid of it after the trial.

566
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,279
He didn't.

567
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,079
But perhaps the main problem
is not the existence of the file.

568
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,639
What are you saying?

569
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:33,439
It's the note, the handwriting.

570
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,359
Dreyfus is innocent.

571
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,119
Go to General Gonse.

572
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,319
He's the head of the secret service.

573
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,879
You should have turned to him
from the start.

574
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:52,799
Indeed, General.

575
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,839
But in the interest of the army
we must act now.

576
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,879
I know what the army's interest is.
Inform General Gonse.

577
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,399
He's in his country house on leave.

578
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,519
General.

579
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,439
Captain!

580
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,519
I thought I made myself clear.

581
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,119
I don't want another Dreyfus affair.

582
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:26,719
This is not another Dreyfus affair,
it's the same one.

583
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,999
Picquart!

584
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,879
- Welcome to the countryside.
- General.

585
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,519
What brings you here?

586
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,039
Come on. Shall we go?

587
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,719
So we haven't arrested
the real culprit.

588
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,839
I'm afraid not.

589
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:10,239
The note could only have been written
by an artillery officer

590
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:14,919
who knows the four departments.
It can't be Esterhazy.

591
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,039
It's Dreyfus.

592
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,599
That was our mistake from the start.

593
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,919
If you look closely,
you'll find they were just notes.

594
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:30,159
One about the cannon, one about the troops
and one about Madagascar.

595
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,919
They weren't official documents.
No, thank you.

596
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,679
It was a bunch of gossip
by a man thirsty for money.

597
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,399
It's not Dreyfus, it's Esterhazy.

598
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,159
I can make a suggestion,
dear Picquart?

599
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:52,919
Please do.

600
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,159
Forget the note.

601
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:01,279
- I beg your pardon?
- Investigate Esterhazy, if you will.

602
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:07,319
- But leave out the note.
- It's the evidence against Esterhazy.

603
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:11,879
A war council has decided
who wrote it. The case is closed.

604
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,799
And if we found out
that Esterhazy is the traitor?

605
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,759
We won't find out.

606
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,839
The case is closed
for the reason I just mentioned.

607
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,879
We want it closed.

608
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:25,119
But the Dreyfus family doesn't accept it.

609
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,759
One leak and they'll accuse
the army of having concealed the truth.

610
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,239
What do you propose?

611
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,719
- Put Dreyfus on trial again.
- Another trial?

612
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,839
- Are you crazy?
- Is that inconceivable?

613
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:46,359
Of course. Everyone would wonder why
such a mistake has been made!

614
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,519
They'll get at the secret file.
It's unthinkable.

615
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,959
Why?

616
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,719
It would embarrass us!

617
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,879
I don't understand you. We know
your opinion about the chosen race.

618
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,919
What do you care
if a Jew is being held on an island?

619
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,919
He's innocent.

620
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,519
How sentimental you are!

621
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:14,239
Lambs, newborn kittens and Dreyfus.
They're all innocent.

622
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:18,839
You talk as if I feel affection
for him, but it's not like that.

623
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:23,399
I'd rather he was guilty,
but the traitor is Esterhazy.

624
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:26,479
Maybe it's Esterhazy or maybe not.

625
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:29,999
If you don't say anything,
no one will ever know.

626
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,359
That's an abominable suggestion.

627
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,079
Should I take this secret to the grave?

628
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,439
Of course!

629
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,639
That is the essence of our profession.

630
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,359
I have nothing more to add on the matter.

631
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:49,719
Don't bring up Dreyfus. That's an order.

632
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,559
Enter.

633
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:01,279
- Colonel, I'm leaving.
- Good night.

634
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,919
- I will lock the doors.
- Leave the keys, I'll do it.

635
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:12,279
- Se volete, posso restare.
- Non c'è bisogno. Lasciate le chiavi.

636
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,439
"The request...

637
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:54,959
I got myself a cartridge
for the Lebel rifle. Dubois.

638
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:08,759
My dear sodomite,
I saw Mr. Dubois this morning.

639
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:12,519
We need to meet today."

640
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,359
Find anything interesting?

641
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,199
- Who's Dubois?
- Jacques Dubois.

642
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:34,199
He works in a printing house at
the service of the War Ministry.

643
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:40,479
So Schwartzkoppen's note that
you said makes allusion to Dreyfus

644
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,039
"I enclose twelve guiding plans for Nice

645
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,559
that that scumbag D gave to me for you."

646
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,759
is actually hinting at Dubois?

647
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,939
- Maybe.
- What do you mean "maybe"?

648
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,759
Who could provide better plans for Nice?

649
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:04,779
Dreyfus? Or Dubois who knows the
German and Italian military personnel?

650
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:09,959
And this? It's your handwriting.

651
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,639
Here you declare to the judges that
a Spanish military attaché told you

652
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,679
that there was a traitor
in the Joint Chiefs.

653
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,759
That's right.

654
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,559
"The Germans have an officer
informing them.

655
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:28,759
Find him, Henry.
If I knew the name, I would tell you."

656
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:34,479
Come on! How can that come
from the mouth of a Spanish marquis?

657
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,319
I paraphrased.

658
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,919
So if I asked the Marquis
if he said those things,

659
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:46,519
- would he confirm it?
- No, he'd lie like everybody else.

660
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:49,999
Stop it, this file is fake.

661
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,439
Have you told General Gonse about this?

662
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:58,799
- I told him Dreyfus is innocent.
- What did he say?

663
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:03,399
- He said to let it go.
- Then let it go.

664
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:08,319
They're the bosses.
We execute orders or we're nothing.

665
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,879
I don't know if Dreyfus is innocent
and I don't give a damn.

666
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,879
If you order me to kill, I will.

667
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,879
If you then tell me it was
the wrong person, it will grieve me.

668
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,759
But it's not my fault, it's the army.

669
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,839
Maybe it's your army,
but it's not mine.

670
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,759
Good night, Major.

671
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,199
Good night.

672
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,679
Colonel.

673
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,799
- That's a great idea.
- I'll do what I can.

674
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:13,719
- Don't compromise the source.
- They won't know anything.

675
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:20,119
You took your time!

676
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:24,359
- Did we have an appointment?
- No, we didn't.

677
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,479
- I stopped by.
- You've never done this before.

678
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,239
I should have done it more often.

679
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,799
It's a small, very quiet section.

680
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:39,999
- Where's the Dreyfus file?
- In the safe.

681
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,559
Be nice, give it to me.

682
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:02,679
Thank you. From now on if you don't have
any objections, I'll take care of it.

683
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,919
- May I know why?
- No.

684
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,239
- Is it all there?
- Of course it is.

685
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,959
- Do you have copies?
- No.

686
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:12,959
Good.

687
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:17,559
Major Henry will deliver
Mrs. Bastian's material to me.

688
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:22,079
You can change the procedure,
not the facts.

689
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:25,879
It is normal that it is delivered
to the head of the secret service.

690
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,439
- Goodbye.
- General.

691
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,239
You look lovely. Where is Philippe?

692
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:37,679
A crisis at the ministry.
He'll be here for the second part.

693
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:41,279
What happened to you?
We haven't seen you in a long time.

694
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,199
The Colonel doesn't see any of us anymore.

695
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,679
- He attends other spheres.
- No.

696
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,439
No champagne? Then it's serious.

697
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:54,959
- What's the matter, Georges?
- Your husband's here.

698
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:59,759
Forgive me for being late,
but it was a state business.

699
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,439
Picquart, I'm glad to see you.

700
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,759
I don't suppose you have read the paper.

701
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:10,719
Look, the copy
of the Dreyfus note.

702
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:15,479
We can finally see him.
Damned reporters!

703
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,119
- Is it important?
- Yes, it is.

704
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,479
A few heads will roll for sure.

705
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:24,679
"The evidence. The copy
of the ntoe written by Dreyfus."

706
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:29,839
Colonel, you command a ship
that travels everywhere.

707
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:34,879
You're right, it's an
outrageous violation of state secrets.

708
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,439
This doesn't stop here.

709
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,359
We have an anonymous letter.

710
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:48,279
It warns us that Esterhazy will be
reported to the Chamber of Deputies

711
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:51,959
as Dreyfus' accomplice. What do you think?

712
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:57,959
I'm dismayed, but... Someone's
trying to sabotage my investigation.

713
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:00,079
- Picquart!
- Control yourselves.

714
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:01,919
This is an intolerable accusation!

715
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:06,599
Are you obsessed with the idea
to replace Dreyfus with Esterhazy?

716
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:11,079
Nothing will stop you. I should
arrest you for gross negligence!

717
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:15,839
This is a bad situation, Picquart.
You disappoint me.

718
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:20,259
I haven't told anyone about the
investigation and I'm not obsessed.

719
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,839
I have a lead on Esterhazy.

720
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:28,919
What would you do if you had proof
that Dreyfus was a spy?

721
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:34,079
If it was assured, I'd accept it.
But there is no such proof.

722
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:44,199
We intercepted a recent letter
of Major Panizzardi

723
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,999
to Colonel Schwartzkoppen.

724
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,919
Here's the passage we're interested in.

725
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:54,319
"I read that a congressman is going
to officially question Dreyfus.

726
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:58,919
If in Rome they should ask me for
explanations, I'll say

727
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,399
that I never had any relationship
with that Jew, of course.

728
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,119
If they ask you, you'll say the same.

729
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:12,279
No one can ever know
what happened to him.

730
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:16,299
So... what do you say?

731
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,679
- Can I see?
- No.

732
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:25,319
When did it arrive?

733
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:28,159
Major Henry received it two weeks ago.

734
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:32,799
I expect you don't doubt
Major Henry's integrity.

735
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:38,599
If you are certain that the document
is authentic, I won't do it.

736
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:44,239
- You admit Dreyfus is guilty?
- If the document is genuine, yes.

737
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:47,159
Given your state of service

738
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:51,279
we won't take any
disciplinary action against you.

739
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,919
However, we demand

740
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,799
that you entrust us with the documents
of your investigation into Esterhazy.

741
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:03,479
You will leave Paris
and begin a tour of inspection

742
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,399
of the safety measures
in the Eastern garrisons.

743
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:12,839
- You're removing me forever?
- No, you'll only be gone a few days.

744
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,959
Mister? Who are you looking for?

745
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,279
- Lawyer Leblois.
- I've seen you before.

746
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,119
You are Colonel Picquart.

747
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,039
Excuse me.

748
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:27,119
- Georges!
- Good day, Martha.

749
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,679
Come on in.

750
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,799
Don't you eat in the army?

751
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:47,719
In Africa the worst thing is the food.
I've missed the French cuisine.

752
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:51,719
It was delicious. Thank you.

753
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:56,399
- You want to stay here?
- If I can. Just for one night.

754
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:58,759
You don't have the apartment anymore?

755
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,559
- I don't want to go there.
- Why not?

756
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,839
- I'm afraid it's being watched.
- By who?

757
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:11,999
You see those two?
They're plainclothes cops.

758
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,079
How do you know that?

759
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:17,559
They worked for me.

760
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,999
The generals understood
that I wouldn't keep quiet.

761
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:27,879
So they sent me on an
inspection at the Somme, then Nice.

762
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:31,319
Later in Marseille, Algiers and Tunisia.

763
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:35,439
I didn't even have time
to stop at my house.

764
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:42,359
- I ended up in an African regiment.
- You could have told us.

765
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:45,839
They intercept my correspondence
and I'm being followed.

766
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:52,879
Last week they wanted to send me
to Tripoli. A suicide mission.

767
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:54,959
My God!

768
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,599
So I realized I had to come back
to Paris at any cost.

769
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,399
- Can you prove any of this?
- Of course.

770
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,199
You have to make it public.

771
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:18,039
It's hard for me, you know.

772
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:21,199
Since I was 18,
the army is my life.

773
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,079
- I'd like to avoid a scandal.
- But it's already a scandal.

774
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:33,839
- One question!
- Do you think Dreyfus is innocent?

775
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,119
Major Esterhazy says
that you work for the Jews.

776
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:42,999
I am General de Pellieux,
I command the Seine department.

777
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:48,279
I've been tasked to investigate
the evidence you have collected

778
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:50,479
regarding Major Esterhazy.

779
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:53,959
- Do you understand?
- Yes, General.

780
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,919
- Do you recognize this?
- Yes.

781
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,099
It's the telegram written to Esterhazy
that Schwartzkoppen never sent.

782
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,999
Who gave it to Captain Lauth
to put it back together?

783
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:06,279
I did.

784
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:09,559
There's no evidence
it came from the embassy.

785
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:14,399
- You may have added it to the papers.
- Yes, but I didn't.

786
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:17,319
Did you know it was forged?

787
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:23,319
They canceled the address
and added Esterhazy's name.

788
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,239
That happened after I left.

789
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:30,719
- You faked it.
- Why would I do that?

790
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:34,559
You work for a Jewish union
that wants Dreyfus released.

791
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,959
You manufactured the evidence
to blame Esterhazy.

792
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:39,399
No need.

793
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,199
The note is proof of his guilt.

794
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:44,359
Yes, the note!

795
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:47,519
I'm glad you mention it.

796
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:51,079
- Did you send a copy to "Le Matin"?
- No.

797
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:55,559
- Did you give information to the press?
- No.

798
01:19:56,560 --> 01:20:00,439
Did you speak to Leblois
about the Esterhazy investigation?

799
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:04,319
- Yes, but I can explain.
- You don't have to.

800
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:08,279
Disclosing confidential
information is a crime.

801
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:12,639
Leblois told a member of the
Senate who reported to the government.

802
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:16,159
- I don't know how it got to the press.
- You have no idea!

803
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:21,919
How much information
did you reveal to Mrs. Monnier?

804
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,240
Mrs. Monnier?

805
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:28,199
The wife of Philippe Monnier
of Foreign Affairs.

806
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:30,479
- It's not about her.
- That is not for you to judge.

807
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,719
Do you recognize these?

808
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,559
They are personal letters
stolen from my house!

809
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:43,119
- It proves the connection with the lady.
- You searched my apartment!

810
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:47,719
Esterhazy saw some documents
of your investigation into him.

811
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:52,679
Kept in the house.
He got them from a woman wearing a veil.

812
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:55,879
- We think it's Mrs. Monnier.
- Was she wearing a veil?

813
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:00,679
- This is no laughing matter.
- It's a low-level melodrama.

814
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:05,759
- Can we talk about essential facts?
- Don't be impertinent.

815
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:09,359
Esterhazy's handwriting
is identical to that on the note.

816
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:10,999
We  are investigating you!

817
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:14,919
The Dreyfus file contained false evidence.

818
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,879
It's not relevant.

819
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,399
- Am I under arrest?
- Not yet.

820
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:24,039
Forgive me, but your investigation
is a farce and I don't want any part of it.

821
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,239
Have a seat.

822
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:29,679
We're not done.

823
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:34,239
Colonel. Colonel!

824
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,799
Thank you.

825
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,999
Here, drink this.

826
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,519
They told Philippe.

827
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:49,919
I knew he'd react
violently if he had known.

828
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,159
After that general...

829
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,799
- Pellieux?
- Yes, him.

830
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:03,159
When they were done questioning me,
they drove me back in a carriage.

831
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:07,359
Philippe was waiting for me.

832
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,399
He sent the girls to his sister.

833
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:16,059
He said I'm not worthy to be a mother.

834
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:23,539
He won't let me see them after
the divorce. Can he really do that?

835
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:25,799
No, certainly not.

836
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,679
You need a lawyer.
We'll ask Leblois.

837
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:33,879
Then you'll leave Paris for a while.

838
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,799
- Why?
- To avoid the press.

839
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,679
Do you have somewhere to go?

840
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:43,199
I can go to my sister in Toulon.

841
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:45,399
Good.

842
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,479
You?

843
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:51,519
I'll be all right.

844
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:23,519
- We're here.
- Yes, thank you.

845
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,159
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

846
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,119
Good to see you.

847
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:34,199
- Our guest, Mr. Charpentier.
- Pleased to meet you.

848
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:37,599
- He's the biggest publisher in Paris.
- You flatter me.

849
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:40,639
- Thank you for this meeting.
- It's an honor.

850
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,439
Let's go.

851
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:48,079
Gentlemen, this is Colonel Picquart.

852
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:50,359
Colonel.

853
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:53,679
- Meet Senator Arthur Ranc.
- Pleased to meet you.

854
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,239
- Joseph Reinach.
- Pleased to meet you.

855
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,039
Member of the Chamber of Deputies.

856
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:00,639
They coordinate the political campaign.

857
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:04,119
Georges Clémenceau,
columnist for "L'Aurore".

858
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:05,519
Colonel.

859
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,519
Mathieu Dreyfus.

860
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,439
For three years he's been fighting
to get justice for his brother.

861
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:17,079
My family and I
are enormously grateful to you.

862
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:21,679
You don't have to thank me,
I just listened to my conscience.

863
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:25,959
Finally, I have the honor
to present to you Emile Zola.

864
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:29,079
I'm a great admirer of yours, Colonel.

865
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:30,999
And I of your works.

866
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:36,599
The Joint Chiefs have put themselves in the
position of protecting the culprit

867
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:41,119
Marie Charles Ferdinand Esterhazy,
to keep Dreyfus in prison.

868
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:48,679
That's why I was the brains
of a conspiracy against Esterhazy.

869
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:52,839
- Therefore I must be punished.
- What will happen to you?

870
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:55,959
I'll be arrested, Mr. Clémenceau.

871
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:59,839
Arrested and probably
kicked out of the army.

872
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:02,319
The army is so narrow-minded!

873
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:04,919
It's the only way to keep
Dreyfus on the island.

874
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,319
It's staggering!

875
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:11,999
- There's shame in being French.
- How can we help you?

876
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:15,159
This story has to be told,
people have to understand.

877
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:18,599
As an officer on duty
I cannot say anything about it.

878
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:20,719
You can't.

879
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:22,839
But I can.

880
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:26,199
Maybe I'll end up on Devil's Island.

881
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:31,119
- Dreyfus will be glad to have company.
- How can you joke?

882
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:34,679
I can't stand the idea
of you alone in a cell.

883
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:39,559
It doesn't matter.
It's a fortress, not a prison.

884
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,919
I'll dedicate myself to reading.

885
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:54,719
I'm sorry I got you involved.

886
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:57,759
I got myself into this.

887
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:16,159
Colonel Picquart.

888
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,879
I have a warrant for your arrest
of the Minister of War.

889
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,719
Can I have your weapon?

890
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:06,999
Buy "L'Aurore"!

891
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:11,239
Emile Zola's letter!
Dreyfus defended by Zola!

892
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,959
Emile Zola's letter to the president!

893
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:17,199
Buy "L'Aurore"!

894
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,319
Boy!

895
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:22,759
Boy, come here. Can we stop?

896
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:40,839
What does it say?

897
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:44,199
"We witness this infamous spectacle.

898
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:48,159
It proclaims the innocence of individuals
burdened by debt and crime

899
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:51,919
and it is damaging an incorruptible man.

900
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:55,519
When a society goes this far,
it decomposes.

901
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:57,959
You don't publish such things!

902
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:10,319
I accuse Lieutenant Colonel
Du Paty de Clam

903
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:14,639
of having been the architect
of this miscarriage of justice."

904
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:19,679
"I accuse General Mercier
that he was complicit

905
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:22,119
of one of the worst iniquities
of the century."

906
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:26,319
"I accuse General Billot of having had

907
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:30,359
evidence of Dreyfus' innocence
and covering it up.

908
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:34,679
He is guilty of crimes
against humanity and justice

909
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:38,559
for political purposes and to save
the compromised General Staff."

910
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:41,639
"I accuse General de Pellieux
and Major Ravary

911
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:46,519
of having conducted an investigation
dominated by monstrous bias.

912
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:51,559
In the report of the latter
we find a monument of naive audacity."

913
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:56,559
"I accuse the expert calligraphers
of having made fraudulent reports

914
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:01,519
unless they were affected by
visual and judgemental illness."

915
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:07,679
"I accuse generals Boisdeffre
and Gonse of the same crime.

916
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:12,599
One through clerical fanaticism,
the other through pride,

917
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:17,359
making the Ministry of War
an holy and untouchable ark."

918
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:22,079
"I accuse the first War Council
of convicting an accused

919
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:23,919
on the basis of a secret document."

920
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:29,839
"I accuse the second War Council
of having covered up

921
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:33,999
the crime of knowingly
acquitting a delinquent."

922
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:36,679
"In making these accusations

923
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:41,839
I knowingly expose myself to
articles 30 and 31 of the Press Law

924
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:47,159
which punish crimes of defamation
and I do this of my own free will."

925
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:54,119
- Traitor!
- To death!

926
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:57,399
Traitor!

927
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:01,999
- Traitor!
- Death to Emile Zola!

928
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:08,239
- To death!
- You must die!

929
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:34,679
- My dear Georges.
- Louis!

930
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:37,979
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

931
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,799
- Good.
- Give it to me.

932
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:43,999
Good heavens!

933
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,719
- What a lovely place!
- Isn't it?

934
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,879
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

935
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,159
Zola has been reported.

936
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:56,639
- By the army?
- No, the government.

937
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,999
- When will he be judged?
- Soon, in two weeks.

938
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:01,559
Two weeks.

939
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:03,839
Zola and Clémenceau
would like you as a witness.

940
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:06,759
- Yes, of course.
- Good.

941
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:10,079
They have the most aggressive lawyer
in Paris, Fernand Labori.

942
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,879
Labori.

943
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,119
- Do you know him?
- No.

944
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:18,839
- They call him "The Viking", right?
- No.

945
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:29,239
You bastard!

946
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:34,079
- Picquart, you bastard!
- Traitor!

947
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:40,519
Bastard!

948
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:56,079
Swear to speak without hate
or fear and tell the whole truth?

949
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:57,439
I swear.

950
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:59,919
- Your name?
- Marie Georges Picquart.

951
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:01,719
Place of residence?

952
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:04,739
Fortress of Mont-Valérien,
prison wing.

953
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:07,799
Attorney Labori.

954
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:13,479
Can you tell the Court
who knows about the Esterhazy affair?

955
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:19,959
In the spring of 1896
I found fragments of a telegram.

956
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:27,119
From the military attaché of a country
foreign to Major Esterhazy.

957
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:31,319
It revealed that Esterhazy
he was feeding him information.

958
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:34,199
Consequently I had Esterhazy monitored.

959
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:39,159
Four months later he wrote about
an assignment at the Joint Chiefs.

960
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:41,159
Twice!

961
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:47,279
The handwriting matched
the note known as "bordereau",

962
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:49,319
attributed to Major Dreyfus.

963
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:52,919
This was confirmed by the first expert
appointed by the government.

964
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:56,679
Did you inform your superiors of this news?

965
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:58,519
- Of course.
- What did they say?

966
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:02,079
They said to keep the two cases separate.

967
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:06,439
Major Lauth, can you come closer?

968
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:15,399
You have stated that you believe

969
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:19,439
that Colonel Picquart
added the telegram

970
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:23,159
to secret documents not yet examined.

971
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:26,639
- That's what I believe.
- Colonel Picquart.

972
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:29,239
That doesn't make it true.

973
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:32,159
Colonel Henry, come forward please.

974
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:33,959
Thank you, Major Lauth.

975
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:43,079
You have said that you saw

976
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:48,639
Colonel Picquart showing
the file to lawyer Leblois.

977
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:52,399
Yes. He was in his office.
He showed him the document

978
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:55,599
in which he calls Dreyfus
"that scumbag D."

979
01:36:56,480 --> 01:37:00,359
- You're wrong. I didn't show it to anyone.
- I saw it.

980
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:03,799
- That's all I can say.
- May I ask a question?

981
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:09,839
- How far did you get in?
- My head was in the door opening.

982
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:14,359
- How could you tell it was him?
- I got a good look.

983
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:19,399
The handwriting is not clear from
up close, let alone from a distance.

984
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:23,959
I know that document
better than anyone and I saw it.

985
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:29,359
You need a full airing? So be it!
I'll tell it like it was.

986
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:33,639
- Colonel Picquart is lying!
- Mr. President!

987
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:40,319
You heard Colonel Henry
calling me a liar

988
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:47,079
and Major Lauth insinuating
that I fabricated the telegram.

989
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:53,359
Do you know why?
All the makers of the Dreyfus case...

990
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:56,719
- Colonel!
- Henry, Gribelin, Lauth,

991
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,239
by order of General Gonse

992
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:02,599
covering up Colonel Sandherr's
mistakes, a sick man.

993
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:05,719
- Sit down!
- Do you know what my crime is?

994
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:10,119
Thinking that honor doesn't defend itself
with blind obedience.

995
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:11,839
Enough!

996
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,319
Maybe I'll get kicked out of the army
that I love and gave 25 years to.

997
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:18,479
Well, so be it.

998
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:23,119
I still believe it was my duty
to seek truth and justice.

999
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:25,279
The army should be served in this way.

1000
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,159
- Enough!
- Honestly.

1001
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:31,039
- Bravo!
- You will pay for this insult.

1002
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:32,719
Silence!

1003
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:42,799
General Pellieux, come to the stand.

1004
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,559
- We're listening.
- Nothing has been said about the Dreyfus affair.

1005
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:59,759
It's <i>res judicata</i> which is judged,
but seeing how it was...

1006
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:05,239
As Colonel Henry says,
"You need a full airing? So be it."

1007
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:11,119
In November 1896,
the Ministry of War received

1008
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:15,679
proof of Dreyfus' guilt.
I've seen it.

1009
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:20,759
It's a letter from one foreign military
attaché to another. This what it says.

1010
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:24,279
"Questions arise about the Dreyfus affair.

1011
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:29,799
Never admit to the relationship
we had with that Jew."

1012
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:33,919
- I ask to speak.
- Pardon me! I am speaking.

1013
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:37,039
- I demand that the document be produced.
- Attorney Labori!

1014
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:40,679
General Gonse, come closer please.

1015
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:47,319
The army fears nothing.

1016
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:50,519
But documents of that nature
remain confidential.

1017
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:56,399
Summon General Boisdeffre.

1018
01:39:56,480 --> 01:40:00,359
- He'll confirm.
- Then summon him.

1019
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:05,079
- Bravo!
- Long live the Republic!

1020
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:08,359
Long live the army!

1021
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:10,719
Long live the Republic!

1022
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,799
- Long live the general!
- Bravo!

1023
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,159
Long live France!

1024
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:20,759
Long live the Republic!

1025
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:22,999
Bravo!

1026
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:25,119
Silence.

1027
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:27,879
Silence!

1028
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:30,159
We're listening.

1029
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:33,639
I heard about General Pellieux's statement.

1030
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:37,759
I confirm all items.
It's precise, it reflects the truth.

1031
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,119
That's all I have to say.

1032
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:43,959
But, gentlemen...

1033
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:47,919
Allow me to add something.

1034
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:51,119
You are the jury.

1035
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:53,919
You are the nation.

1036
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:58,519
If the nation no longer has confidence
in the leaders of its army

1037
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:01,919
to have responsibility
for the national defence

1038
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:06,479
then leave this task to others.

1039
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:10,519
- Bravo!
- It's a coup d'etat.

1040
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:14,839
Will they resign if they don't get
the verdict they demand?

1041
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:19,559
- You don't have the floor. Thank you, General.
- I have some questions for him.

1042
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:21,199
You don't have the floor.

1043
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:24,599
Colonel Picquart wants to say something.

1044
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:26,639
Colonel, come closer please.

1045
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:35,519
If Generals Pellieux and Boisdeffre
had not revealed its existence

1046
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,599
I wouldn't have mentioned it.

1047
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:41,399
I am bound by the oath of secrecy.

1048
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:48,999
The letter they're talking about, this
irrefutable evidence, is fake.

1049
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:51,799
- Cowardly liar!
- Clown!

1050
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:55,919
- That's a lie!
- Silence!

1051
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:59,719
Silence!

1052
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:09,719
The question is this.
Did Emile Zola publish lies

1053
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:14,439
designed to compromise the honour
and reputation of the army?

1054
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:17,799
Members of the jury,
what is your verdict?

1055
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:26,239
On my honor and conscience

1056
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:32,799
the verdict of the jury is...
Yes, the defendant is guilty.

1057
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,279
Bravo!

1058
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:38,919
By virtue of this, the Court
condemns you to one year imprisonment

1059
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,839
- and a fine of 3,000 francs.
- Yes!

1060
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:42,159
Bravo.

1061
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:44,239
- Long live France.
- Bravo!

1062
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:50,279
- Long live France!
- That's right!

1063
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:52,079
- That's right!

1064
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:59,399
Gentlemen, if one of you is injured,
the duel will be interrupted.

1065
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:04,799
After inspection of the wound, if the
wounded man wants, the duel will resume.

1066
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:08,799
En garde!

1067
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:13,119
Go!

1068
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:17,319
Mr. referee, this is ridiculous!

1069
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,359
Stop!

1070
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:27,559
Doctor! Examine the wound.

1071
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:30,119
It's nothing, he just missed you.

1072
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:33,239
- That man is crazy.
- No, he's desperate.

1073
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:36,599
I'm fine!

1074
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:38,199
It's nothing!

1075
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,559
I'm ready.

1076
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:50,479
En garde!

1077
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,319
Go!

1078
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,999
Stop!

1079
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,599
No! I can go on.

1080
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:53,199
Give me a minute!

1081
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:24,159
Examination.

1082
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:59,279
- Who are you?
- Labori.

1083
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:03,839
So, how is life at Santé?

1084
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:06,679
Mont-Valérien was better.

1085
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:09,479
I have a present for you.

1086
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:15,639
"Today Colonel Henry admitted
to be the author of the letter

1087
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:19,399
of October 1896
in which Dreyfus was named.

1088
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:24,359
The Minister of War has
ordered Henry's arrest.

1089
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:26,319
He's in Mont-Valérien now."

1090
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:28,879
- Why did he confess?
- He had no choice.

1091
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:32,239
His letter was poorly made.

1092
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:34,919
He glued pieces together
that didn't match.

1093
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,479
Poor fool!

1094
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:40,479
They'll have to redo the trial
and repatriate Dreyfus.

1095
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:44,399
I'll call Henry to the stand.
We'll bring down the government.

1096
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:15,199
Look, it's Picquart!

1097
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:17,159
- Colonel!
- One question!

1098
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:21,319
- Gentlemen, one moment.
- Quiet!

1099
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:24,119
I'm satisfied.

1100
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:29,759
After a year in prison the government
has dropped the charges against me.

1101
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:34,599
It also decided to review
Captain Dreyfus' conviction.

1102
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:40,399
- I demand that Esterhazy be arrested.
- Esterhazy has challenged you to a duel.

1103
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:41,480
What will you do?

1104
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:45,639
He's a criminal,
justice will take care of him.

1105
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:56,879
There he is.

1106
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:16,119
I'll kill you, you filthy coward!

1107
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:29,519
- I will have satisfaction!
- Look for her among your whores.

1108
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:33,559
Coward! Traitor! Dirty Jew!

1109
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:48,639
- Name.
- Alfred Dreyfus.

1110
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:50,079
Speak up.

1111
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:52,359
Alfred Dreyfus.

1112
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:55,439
- Age?
- Thirty-nine.

1113
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:58,279
- Place of birth?
- Mulhouse.

1114
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:02,239
- Rank?
- Captain, diplomat at the Joint Chiefs.

1115
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:05,279
You are accused of high treason.

1116
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:08,239
- How do you plead?
- I am...

1117
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,519
I'm... I'm innocent.

1118
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:22,479
Once again, on the honor
of my name and my children.

1119
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:26,919
Colonel, I swear. I am innocent.

1120
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,639
About face!

1121
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:33,119
Present arms!

1122
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,599
General Mercier has the floor.

1123
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:52,239
I ordered the delivery of a
file of evidence to the judges.

1124
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:56,339
There was a secret document
and it should have stayed that way.

1125
01:50:56,560 --> 01:51:01,759
Let me add something. I am an
honest son of an honest man.

1126
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:05,039
If I had doubts, I would admit it.

1127
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:07,839
I would tell Captain Dreyfus
that I made a mistake.

1128
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:09,479
Then tell him!

1129
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:19,279
But it's not like that. Since 1894
nothing has made my conviction waver.

1130
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:25,079
It has been strengthened by the
painful efforts to prove his innocence.

1131
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:28,999
Not to mention the millions spent
on him by the Jewish people.

1132
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:33,239
Mr. President,
may I question the witness?

1133
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:38,759
Given the time, we'll continue
listening to the testimony tomorrow.

1134
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:40,479
- But why?
- The hearing is adjourned.

1135
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:41,999
You may go, General.

1136
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:48,319
Georges!

1137
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:52,439
- Are you ready?
- Yes, I'm coming!

1138
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:10,839
Picquart! Gast!

1139
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:14,799
Good day, Labori.

1140
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:17,799
- Are you ready for battle?
- Ready as I'll ever be.

1141
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:23,599
We're gonna blow up General Mercier
with the arsenal you provided.

1142
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,719
My God!

1143
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:33,879
- Hurry! Help!
- Stay with him!

1144
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,719
- He's been shot!
- Help me!

1145
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:40,599
Help!

1146
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:44,559
Stop him! Murderer! Stop him!

1147
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:26,599
"In the name of the French people,

1148
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:30,599
today, September 9, 1899,

1149
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:35,759
the War Coucil of the
10th Legion of the Army Corps...

1150
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:39,319
declares the defendant Dreyfus Alfred,

1151
01:54:39,960 --> 01:54:43,239
Captain of the 14th Artillery Regiment,

1152
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:48,999
by five votes to two,
guilty of high treason."

1153
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:51,159
Long live France!

1154
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:54,559
Boo!

1155
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:03,639
"With the same majority and
given the extenuating circumstances

1156
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:08,519
the Court therefore commutes the sentence
to ten years in prison."

1157
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:15,399
Extenuating circumstances!

1158
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:21,119
Watch over my wife.

1159
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:24,799
Of course.

1160
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:34,919
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1161
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:39,199
Mathieu Dreyfus arrived
as I was leaving the house.

1162
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:40,280
What did he want?

1163
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:42,399
They offered his brother a pardon.

1164
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:45,399
- He wanted my advice.
- Wonderful!

1165
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:51,039
- What did you tell him?
- He doesn't have to accept.

1166
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:55,759
- But then he'll be free.
- Free, but technically guilty.

1167
01:55:55,840 --> 01:56:00,759
- He hasn't seen his children in 5 years!
- He has to hang in there. We will win.

1168
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:03,479
It'll be quicker if he stays in jail.

1169
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:07,119
- Waiter! A cognac.
- Right away.

1170
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:13,959
Now that your divorce is official,

1171
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:17,439
- maybe we could get married.
- We could.

1172
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:21,279
Do you think we should?

1173
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:25,919
- Do you want me to ask for your hand?
- Not particularly.

1174
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:28,679
Why?

1175
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:33,159
Darling, it doesn't make much sense
if you ask me that way.

1176
01:56:34,280 --> 01:56:35,639
Don't you think?

1177
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:38,479
Forgive me.

1178
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:44,679
Will you marry me?

1179
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:46,599
No.

1180
01:56:48,200 --> 01:56:50,599
Seriously? You refuse?

1181
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:56,479
You're not the marrying kind.
And deep down, neither am I.

1182
01:56:58,160 --> 01:56:59,959
Let's continue as before.

1183
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:34,679
Mr. Minister,
Major Dreyfus is here.

1184
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:37,559
Let him in.

1185
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:41,999
General.

1186
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,999
Major.

1187
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:55,159
Please.

1188
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:58,879
Have a seat.

1189
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:04,759
- Have you been here before?
- No, Minister.

1190
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:10,279
All right, then.

1191
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:14,919
- What did you want to discuss?
- My rank.

1192
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:21,499
My promotion to major does not take
into account the years of imprisonment.

1193
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:26,359
Your eight years
outside the army are considered

1194
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:30,919
like you've been through them
on duty. It's unfair.

1195
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,759
I consider it a prejudice.

1196
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:39,039
I see. What should I do about it?

1197
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:43,199
Promote me to my due rank.

1198
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:47,599
- Which is?
- Lieutenant Colonel.

1199
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:53,879
- That requires a special law.
- It should be done, it would be right.

1200
01:58:54,280 --> 01:58:57,159
- That's not possible.
- Why not?

1201
01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:01,879
The law wouldn't pass.
The political climate has changed.

1202
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:06,399
It is already difficult to work
with those who were our enemies.

1203
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:10,599
- Why reopen the matter?
- Because it's the right thing.

1204
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:14,799
I'm sorry, that's not possible.

1205
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:26,159
- If that's all...
- Yes, that's all.

1206
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:39,919
I'm sorry that we couldn't talk
in private these last few years.

1207
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:43,959
No, indeed.
Not since the morning of my arrest.

1208
01:59:44,360 --> 01:59:48,599
Yes. I apologize for the role
that I had in this sad charade.

1209
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:51,559
You recovered very well.

1210
01:59:54,680 --> 01:59:59,679
It's good to have done all this
and finally be elected to government.

1211
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:02,959
And yet it's strange to say, but...

1212
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:07,999
- I wouldn't be here without you.
- No, General.

1213
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:11,459
You're here because you did your duty.

1214
02:00:22,300 --> 02:00:27,300
The two men never met again.

1214
02:00:28,305 --> 02:01:28,375

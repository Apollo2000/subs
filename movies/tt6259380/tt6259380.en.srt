Um.

979
00:54:05,952 --> 00:54:07,328
One more thing.

980
00:54:09,247 --> 00:54:10,790
What's that?

981
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:12,333
We're partners.

984
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:24,387
Do you remember when
I first found you?

985
00:54:26,055 --> 00:54:27,407
You were eating out of a
dumpster like a little

986
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:29,183
stray dog.

987
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:31,769
Do you remember that, Garrett?

988
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:34,355
How I took you in,
I cleaned you up,

989
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:38,276
and I gave you all the
things you didn't have?

990
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:39,777
I'm grateful.

991
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,445
But let me explain something.

992
00:54:41,529 --> 00:54:44,073
There's too much territory,
and there's too much product,

993
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:46,951
to lay it all at the
feet of one person.

994
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:48,494
We work this together.

995
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:51,080
We pay off the Trust,
then you and me,

996
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:53,874
we won't be answering to anyone.

997
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:57,795
You and me.

998
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:01,299
You and me.

999
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:09,974
Okay, Garrett.

1000
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:12,268
You have a deal.

1001
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:16,772
You earned it.

1002
00:55:16,856 --> 00:55:18,232
Yeah.

<i>(distant siren)</i>

1005
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,255
No fly zone starts right
there, Main and 5th.

1006
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:43,132
Then that's where we should go.

1007
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:46,844
This whole thing's going down

1008
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:48,471
right in the middle
of Lincoln City.

1009
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:51,599
Because of the towers, drones
are restricted from downtown.

1010
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:54,018
That means we do this quietly.

1011
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:56,145
The longer it stays that
way, the longer we have,

1012
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:58,189
so nobody pop off.

1013
00:55:58,272 --> 00:55:59,440
Truck comes down this street.

1014
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:01,817
We can't do it here,
way too many cameras.

1015
00:56:01,901 --> 00:56:03,486
Main Street's gonna be worse.

1016
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:05,988
What if we send it
down there?

1017
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:07,030
When it's at the cutoff,

1018
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:08,491
we're gonna put
Connor in the alley.

1019
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:10,159
We secure the area.

1020
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:12,054
Anyone calls in an attack,
restrictions get lifted,

1021
00:56:12,078 --> 00:56:14,080
and they'll be on us in seconds.

1022
00:56:14,163 --> 00:56:16,183
We take down the Guardians
and we round up the cops.

1023
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:18,125
Okay, we tie them
up, we get the Psyke,

1024
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:19,227
we get out, we
don't kill anyone.

1025
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:20,251
It's different
this time, Connor.

1026
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:21,252
CONNOR: It doesn't matter.

1027
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:23,005
Nobody has to die.

1028
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:24,548
This truck has four
Guardians on it.

1029
00:56:24,632 --> 00:56:27,051
It has 10 times the surge
protection of a drone.

1030
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:31,180
Only way that we make it
work is if we get you close,

1031
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:33,224
you have one shot.

1032
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:35,142
You hit it, and we
have the window.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I
know he's classified,

1034
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,354
but he's still
only one Electric.

1035
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:40,189
What's the plan if the

1036
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:41,272
I won't.

He won't.

1
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:32,642
I don't understand it.

2
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,892
Nothing on here
indicates land for miles.

3
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:37,059
What could we possibly have hit?

4
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:39,017
Has it occurred to you

5
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:41,226
that we're not where
you thought we were?

6
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,476
It doesn't make any sense.

7
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,226
Well, you're reading it wrong, sir.
Jim.

8
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,476
What?

9
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,892
The man's an idiot!

10
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,934
He can't even read
a chart properly.

11
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:06,250
Well, I don't know what he's
done what that. Jim, enough!

12
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:11,226
It's all right, Ferris.

13
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,017
I don't know where we are.

14
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,125
Land!

15
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,041
Land!

16
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,892
Row, Bickley!

17
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,875
Row! Row, man!

18
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,351
We need to get you warm, sir.

19
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:52,166
I could... try
and get a fire started.

20
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,333
I'll give you a hand.

21
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,541
Useless anyway.

22
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,351
We'll be lucky if this works.
It's all pretty damp.

23
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,791
But it's worth a shot.

24
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,726
I can try and find some flint.

25
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,476
Good idea, Cailean.

26
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,476
I'll go and see
if I can find any shelter.

27
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,517
We should stay together. We don't
know what's on this island.

28
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,559
Come off it, man!

29
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,434
Surely you couldn't
have got us so lost

30
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,892
that we're somewhere
off the East Indies?

31
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:58,142
I'm sure I can handle myself if I come
across a primitive Highland Pict.

32
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,476
Jesus!

33
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,934
Good morning, gentlemen.

34
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,767
Morning!

35
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,559
I'm Fingal MacLeod.

36
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,517
Welcome to the island.

37
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,517
We're extremely relieved to make
your acquaintance, Mr. MacLeod.

38
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:14,267
Our ship sank in the mist, and our
row boat barely made it here.

39
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,351
Might I presume that we're somewhere
off the west coast of Scotland?

40
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,166
Thereabouts, aye.

41
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,309
Well, looks like you could all
do with a restorative, hmm?

42
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,892
Follow me.

43
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,559
Our ship hit some rocks
not far from here.

44
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,476
There may be some survivors.

45
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,017
Perhaps if we built a fire,

46
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,333
they might be able
to follow it to shore.

47
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,726
I'll tell you what.

48
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,559
You come and dry
yourselves at my cottage,

49
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,601
and I'll come back
and light a fire.

50
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,476
We'll make sure
if there's anyone out there,

51
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,101
they'll know where to swim to.

52
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,976
We do need to get you warm, sir,

53
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,041
and take a look at your arm.

54
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,351
There we go.

55
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:24,416
Have your fill.
There's plenty more.

56
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,059
We haven't much here,
but porridge we have.

57
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,708
We're very grateful, sir.

58
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,583
Bickley, have you the, um...

59
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,309
Where'd you get this?

60
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,559
We managed to salvage a little from
the ship before she went down.

61
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,208
Thank you kindly.

62
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,000
Now, eat.

63
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,934
So tell me,
where are you from? Navy?

64
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,559
Merchant.

65
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,458
So you're on your own.

66
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,309
Where were you headed?
New York,

67
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,934
where I still intend to go.

68
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,184
The land of opportunity.

69
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:19,059
You certainly can't say that about
this place. Where are we exactly?

70
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,958
Do you know
what happened out there?

71
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,934
We got lost.

72
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,726
Quite spectacularly.

73
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,976
This island isn't on
any of the charts we had.

74
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,642
No.
And then the mist came in.

75
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,809
We couldn't see a thing
except a light in the distance.

76
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,684
A light?

77
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,767
Yes. It seemed a long way
off, so we carried on.

78
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,101
Even though the first mate said we should
stop. It was the captain's decision.

79
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,726
We ran aground, the ship sank,
and you're still defending him!

80
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,333
That's enough, sailor!
Gentlemen.

81
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,851
My apologies,
Mr. MacLeod.

82
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,041
We've been through
quite the ordeal.

83
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,101
Now, we need to get
that wound seen to.

84
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,684
There's a farm a little way off.

85
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:08,101
We'll get Lanthe Innis
to take a look at it.

86
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,476
Thank you, sir, but perhaps we could
organize that fire on the beach first?

87
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,392
Finish up.
I'll see to it now,

88
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,017
and then we'll head to the farm.

89
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,101
They'll have space
for you all to stay there

90
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,184
until we can work out a way to
get you back to the mainland.

91
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,642
I'll help you with the fire, sir.
No, lad.

92
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,517
You rest,
get your strength back.

93
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,642
When is the next boat
to the mainland, Mr. MacLeod?

94
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,934
They're coming, Lanthe.

95
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,559
What? Who are?

96
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,708
Three of them.
Survivors.

97
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,851
Wait. How?

98
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,291
I don't know, but they're here.
And they can help us.

99
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,559
Where are they now?

100
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,267
MacLeod got to them first.

101
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,833
Lanthe!

102
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,916
Hmm.
What, sir?

103
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,726
Nothing.

104
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,333
Just that our host has
excellent taste in literature.

105
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,791
September 22, 1841.

106
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,601
Stop! Stop!
Turn back!

107
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,851
It's happened again.

108
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,809
Another ship has broken
upon the rocks.

109
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,309
You're headed towards the rocks!

110
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,226
I tried to help them,
but they couldn't hear me.

111
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,517
That awful, deafening sound.

112
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,726
Right that's done.

113
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,250
All set then?

114
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,351
How many people
are on the island, Mr. MacLeod?

115
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,809
"Fingal," please.

116
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,642
It's been a tough few years.

117
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,976
The food plight
of '41 devastated

118
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,559
what was once very fertile land.

119
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,892
Most have moved on now.

120
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,684
You mentioned earlier about
getting us back to the mainland.

121
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,851
Is there a regular crossing?

122
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,809
I wouldn't say it was
particularly regular, no.

123
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,101
I see. So...
All in good time.

124
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,684
Leave them be, old man!

125
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,125
You can't keep them
for yourself.

126
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,476
You've come back for me!

127
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,375
You leave them be, Korrigan!

128
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,000
Leave! Leave now.
You mustn't be here.

129
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,791
Go home.

130
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,958
Careful, Fingal.

131
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,267
Sorry about that.
Ignore her.

132
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,851
Just the ravings of a mad woman.

133
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:58,017
Her brother was taken
by the sea a few years back.

134
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,726
She's never quite recovered.

135
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,500
Let's press on.

136
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,708
She certainly took
a liking to you, Jim.

137
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,458
Can you blame her?

138
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,750
Douglas?

139
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,708
I've some guests for you.

140
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,476
Their brig hit upon
some trouble.

141
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,934
These poor fellows were the only
ones that managed to survive.

142
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,125
I thought they could
stay with you.

143
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,517
No.
I don't think so.

144
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:25,059
Master Gosling here is in a
pretty bad way, Douglas.

145
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,392
Perhaps your Lanthe might be
able to take a look at him.

146
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,750
They can't stay here, Fingal.
Lanthe's not been well.

147
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,767
They managed to salvage a few

148
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,916
interesting supplies, Douglas.

149
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,601
Rum.
Pleased to meet you, sir.

150
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,892
I'm Midshipman Oliver Gosling,
and these gentlemen

151
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,125
are Able Seamen Jim Bickley
and Cailean Ferris.

152
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,041
Rum, sir.

153
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,267
You'll have to forgive Douglas.

154
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,416
We don't have
many visitors these days.

155
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,476
Thank you, MacLeod.

156
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,226
Aye, well, I'll be off then.

157
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,226
I'll let you know if we have any
luck with that fire of yours.

158
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,226
Thank you for your kindness, Mr. MacLeod.
And that boat you mentioned?

159
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,351
The boat?

160
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,684
To the mainland.
Oh, yes.

161
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,934
MacLeod...

162
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,666
Good day.

163
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,142
You'd better
sit yourselves down.

164
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:35,059
I'll go make the room up for the young
officer, get blankets for the other two.

165
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,642
He is not staying
in William's room.

166
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,267
They can all sleep down here.

167
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,976
Uncle, he's wounded.
He needs a proper bed.

168
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,726
Aye, well, you get
yourself back upstairs

169
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,208
soon as you've tended
to him, hmm?

170
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,767
So how many were aboard?

171
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,642
Sixteen.

172
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,642
And you were the only survivors?
We couldn't see.

173
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,101
It was thick with fog.

174
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:25,142
Couldn't even see
a yard in front of you.

175
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,666
Just hear the screaming.

176
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,333
Sorry.

177
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,559
It was chaos.

178
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,500
I didn't know
what was happening.

179
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,333
But I thought I heard singing.

180
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,166
Excuse me.

181
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,642
I'm sorry.

182
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,583
Was it something I said?

183
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,976
You're all right.

184
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,791
It's not you.

185
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,125
Rum.

186
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,809
A few years ago now,

187
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,541
one of our fishing boats sank.

188
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,125
All the young men were drowned.

189
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,458
It hit this wee community hard.

190
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,416
Good night.

191
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:54,458
There's something
really weird going on here.

192
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
Pull yourself together.

193
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,583
Guide us home, eh?

194
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,041
Jacob!

195
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,559
Bickley.

196
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,726
Sir.

197
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,500
Did you sleep?

198
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,166
Some.

199
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,208
How's the arm?

200
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,226
Good, thank you.

201
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,476
Morning, sir.

202
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,726
Goodness, Bickley,
you look awful.

203
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,083
Thanks, Ferris.

204
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,166
Gentlemen,

205
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,517
I think we should have a look to see if
we can get off this island ourselves.

206
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:38,601
Why, sir? Didn't Fingal say he was
going to help us with a boat?

207
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:42,166
No, you're right, sir. We
should have a look ourselves.

208
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,351
We don't want to
burden these people

209
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,000
any longer than we have to.

210
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,976
We can see who else is
on the island,

211
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,517
bargain some rum
for a decent boat, but...

212
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:56,601
let's not mention
anything to our hosts.

213
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,166
Agreed?

214
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,226
Good morning.
I hope you all slept well.

215
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,392
Perfectly, thank you, Lanthe.

216
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,434
I trust your arm's feeling
better, Mr. Gosling?

217
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:10,017
"Oliver," please.
And yes.

218
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,684
Yes, much better, thank you.
Remarkably so, in fact.

219
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,916
Good. I'm glad. I'll make a
start on breakfast then.

220
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:22,125
We were thinking of
exploring the island today.

221
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:24,726
Why?

222
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,726
Stretch our legs,
get some fresh air,

223
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,726
see what your lovely
home has to offer.

224
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,833
There's nothing out there.
Not anymore.

225
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,976
Still...
You should stay inside, Oliver.

226
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,267
Get your rest.
You won't heal if you don't.

227
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,809
Let the others go if they must.

228
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:43,000
We can report back anything we find, and you
can take a look when you're feeling stronger.

229
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:48,809
Very well.
Thank you, Bickley.

230
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,666
You can tell me about your home.

231
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:54,517
What's this?
Mr. Bickley and Mr. Ferris

232
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,476
were going to have
a wee look around the island,

233
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,226
but I told Mr. Gosling
he should stay here and rest.

234
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,726
There's nothing
for you out there.

235
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,476
Just thought
we'd take the opportunity

236
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,226
of having an explore,
that's all.

237
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:08,267
There's nothing
for you to explore.

238
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,434
This is a dead isle.

239
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:14,142
We're only here
'cause we've no choice.

240
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:16,267
Besides,

241
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:18,184
there's a storm coming.

242
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,041
We'll wrap up warm.

243
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:25,458
Suit yourselves.

244
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,458
I'll make a start
on the porridge then.

245
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,791
It's a good job I like porridge.

246
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,684
I can't find anything.

247
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,583
I'm looking, I am.

248
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,767
No.

249
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:38,625
No, I don't want to.
Not this one.

250
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,041
Yes.

251
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:46,000
Yes, of course I know they did.

252
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:50,250
Aye.

253
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,625
Anything?

254
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:08,226
No.
It's completely empty.

255
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,916
Another one.

256
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,166
What on earth happened here?

257
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,392
Douglas was right.

258
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:32,809
There's nothing here.

259
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:34,976
The place is dead.

260
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,059
What do you think?
Go back?

261
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:41,059
There must be an old
boat or something here.

262
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:42,892
Where did they all go?

263
00:26:42,916 --> 00:26:45,750
Why are you so desperate to leave?
Because...

264
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,559
Because there are only four people on
this island, and they're all weird.

265
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:52,958
You'd be a weird too
if you lived here too long.

266
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:56,416
They've been kind to us so far.

267
00:26:57,708 --> 00:26:59,434
Why did they stay
when everyone else

268
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:01,642
clearly had the sense to leave?

269
00:27:01,666 --> 00:27:03,476
I suppose they...

270
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:07,184
Maybe we should go.
Let's split up.

271
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,892
We'll cover
more ground that way,

272
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:10,392
hopefully find something useful.

273
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:12,184
Jim, I don't think...
Cailean, just...

274
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:14,184
Okay.

275
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:16,750
But if it starts to rain,
I'm going back.

276
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,226
Good lad.

277
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,083
See you in an hour.

278
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,875
What were you talking
to her about?

279
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,476
Nothing.
She just wanted food.

280
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,476
Ah, don't give me that, Lanthe.

281
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,333
What was she doing here?

282
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:02,892
She's worked herself up
over the sailors.

283
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:06,017
You must've noticed
the resemblance to Jacob.

284
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:08,642
Aye. Well, I don't want
you getting worked up.

285
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:11,125
You stay away from her,
do you hear me?

286
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:15,125
I'll make a start on supper.

287
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:49,000
Typical.

288
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:52,208
Where am I?

289
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:03,833
Bickley?

290
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:15,375
Bickley?

291
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,791
Bickley!

292
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:57,351
He's not in.
Jesus, man!

293
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:59,851
Oh I'm sorry, laddie.
How can I help?

294
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:02,291
Oh, I just, uh...

295
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:05,476
Where is everyone?

296
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,750
We've been all round the island.

297
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,309
What happened?
Oh.

298
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,267
That's a very long story.

299
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:16,309
And it's time
you got back to the farm.

300
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:19,375
It gets awful dark awful
quick around these parts.

301
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:24,184
Fingal, how do we get back
to the mainland?

302
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:27,458
There must be a...
Oh, I almost forgot. Your matches.

303
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:31,666
You must have left
them yesterday.

304
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:36,375
Best get inside
before it gets too dark.

305
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,500
Mind your way.

306
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,458
Yeah.

307
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:45,250
Thank you.

308
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,916
Bickley?

309
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:59,166
Gosling?

310
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:04,000
Bickley!

311
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:06,708
Somebody!

312
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:17,726
What have you been doing out there?
Oh!

313
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,892
I just got muddled as to
where I was, that's all.

314
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:21,559
It gets pretty dark quick.

315
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,809
You shouldn't be out after dark.

316
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:26,934
It's not safe out there.
There's cliffs and bogs,

317
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:29,226
rabbit holes
you snap your ankle in,

318
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,916
all sorts of things.

319
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:34,476
Anything of interest, Bickley?

320
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,267
Uh, no.
The place is deserted.

321
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:40,375
I told you. There's nothing
for you out there.

322
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:46,000
Did Ferris find anything?

323
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:49,000
Is he not with you?

324
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:51,666
What?

325
00:33:52,791 --> 00:33:54,833
Why weren't you together?

326
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:57,809
Well, we... Uh, he...

327
00:33:57,833 --> 00:34:00,017
he just wanted to have
a look by himself.

328
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:02,351
Explore and all that.

329
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:04,934
I thought he'd be back
by now though.

330
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:07,226
We need to look for him.
No, no, no, no.

331
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,976
You're not gonna...

332
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,833
Bickley?

333
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:13,916
Gosling?

334
00:34:15,791 --> 00:34:17,392
Somebody!

335
00:34:17,416 --> 00:34:19,416
Right, Lanthe?
What?

336
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:23,851
Oh, yes.

337
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:25,666
He'll be fine.

338
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,184
Excuse me.

339
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:29,851
I'm sorry.
I just need to...

340
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:33,250
Miss Innis?
No, it's all right.

341
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:37,125
She has bad nerves is all.

342
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:45,101
Stay here.

343
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:48,291
What you doing?
You should get warm.

344
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:57,791
Get you away from that window.

345
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:02,500
Don't touch me!

346
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:06,166
Come on!
No! No!

347
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:24,059
Quiet!

348
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,458
Shh!

349
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:09,101
So if you came
back past Fingal's cottage,

350
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,851
then you must have split up...

351
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:15,875
somewhere around here, correct?

352
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:20,767
Bickley!

353
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:23,184
What?

354
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:25,726
At first light, we'll set
out along this route

355
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,041
and see if we can
retrace his steps.

356
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:45,166
Do you hear that?

357
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:17,833
Cailean.

358
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:21,708
Ferris?

359
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:24,142
Ferris?

360
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:25,851
There's no one there, Bickley.

361
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:27,875
Oliver?

362
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:30,642
I didn't see anything.

363
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,291
Cailean?

364
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:14,767
Another ship
has broken upon the rocks.

365
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:16,892
This time it was one of ours.

366
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:20,309
I found the bodies washed up
on the shore this morning.

367
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:23,476
No. Not "washed up."

368
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,392
It was if they'd
been placed there,

369
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:29,434
all in a perfect line.

370
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:31,934
Poor Billy.

371
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:34,601
He should never have gone out.

372
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:38,101
He wasn't a fisherman,
but he wanted to help.

373
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:40,541
We're so desperate for food.

374
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:03,583
Was this our fault?

375
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:08,166
I can't help but think
we're being punished.

376
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:55,250
Oh, no.

377
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:21,208
Do you think it's Ferris?

378
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:33,851
He must have fell in the storm.

379
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:37,476
These cliffs become
treacherous in bad weather.

380
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,726
What do you think
happened to his face?

381
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,791
Probably fell into
all sorts on his way down.

382
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:52,333
He should be buried at sea.

383
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:56,142
We need a boat.

384
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,184
Fingal, can we borrow yours?

385
00:43:58,208 --> 00:44:00,666
Don't be ridiculous.
In this storm?

386
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:04,583
The boat's too small.
It's far too dangerous.

387
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:14,458
Help me wrap him, Bickley.

388
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:34,559
We bury him tonight.

389
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:37,458
We're not waiting for good weather. It
could be months in a place like this.

390
00:44:38,416 --> 00:44:40,250
I have a bad feeling, sir.

391
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,309
It's this island.

392
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:46,166
It's not just the island.
It's the people.

393
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,976
I've been stashing
supplies, sir...

394
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,976
Food, oil, water.

395
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,059
I think we should make
a break for it tonight.

396
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:57,351
And we take Ferris with us,
give him to the sea.

397
00:44:57,375 --> 00:45:00,517
It doesn't look like this ship's
going to materialize anytime soon.

398
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:03,392
I'll make a start in getting
things in order, sir.

399
00:45:03,416 --> 00:45:04,958
Bickley.

400
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,833
Good lad.

401
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,517
Please don't leave.

402
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:19,976
Lanthe.

403
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,833
Sorry. I didn't mean
to frighten you.

404
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:24,791
How long have you been there?

405
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:28,458
Don't go. Not yet.

406
00:45:30,083 --> 00:45:33,000
We need to give Ferris
a proper seaman's burial.

407
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:36,500
You're not coming back.

408
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:40,458
I know you're not.

409
00:45:47,041 --> 00:45:48,916
Why don't you come with us?

410
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:54,791
I can't leave.

411
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,267
Why?

412
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:01,267
You could have a life here.
Help us rebuild the island.

413
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:03,750
We don't belong here, Lanthe.
Neither do you.

414
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:09,208
Lanthe?

415
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:12,333
Are you all right?

416
00:46:24,208 --> 00:46:26,000
Stay, Oliver.

417
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:45,083
Excuse me.

418
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,791
I'm feeling a little unwell.

419
00:46:57,916 --> 00:47:00,726
Why don't you come inside,

420
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:02,958
and I'll take a look at you.

421
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,226
No! Leave him alone!
Lanthe, stop!

422
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,958
No!

423
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:52,791
Where have you been?

424
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:56,958
Let's go.

425
00:49:24,416 --> 00:49:26,767
Oh, shit.

426
00:49:26,791 --> 00:49:28,750
It looks like he's in.

427
00:49:31,416 --> 00:49:34,184
Well, you take
Ferris down to the boat.

428
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:36,000
I'll go and check.

429
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:06,642
Jesus, man!

430
00:50:06,666 --> 00:50:09,250
Sorry, sir.
Is he in there?

431
00:50:10,416 --> 00:50:13,583
He's asleep.
Let's be quick.

432
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:24,642
Sorry.

433
00:50:24,666 --> 00:50:26,458
It's my shoulder.

434
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:42,500
Shh! Quiet, boy.

435
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:50,916
Sorry, Ferris.
Cold hands.

436
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:26,166
This is as good a place as any.

437
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,750
Oars in.

438
00:51:38,041 --> 00:51:39,541
Uh...

439
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,250
Jim?

440
00:51:48,166 --> 00:51:49,583
Well...

441
00:51:52,833 --> 00:51:55,166
You were a good lad, Cailean.

442
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:59,017
Awful sailor, but a good lad.

443
00:52:01,416 --> 00:52:04,708
I never heard you speak
a bad word against anyone.

444
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,559
I'm sorry I wasn't there,

445
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:11,541
I should have been.

446
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:17,791
Come on.

447
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:47,833
God be with you,
Mr. Ferris.

448
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:03,726
Maybe we should go back.

449
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,642
Leave at first light instead.
What? No.

450
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:10,017
We've got everything with us,
I'm not going back there.

451
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:12,642
I can't see anything out here.

452
00:53:12,666 --> 00:53:15,476
No, I won't be able to navigate.
We'll have to go back.

453
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,392
That doesn't make sense, sir.

454
00:53:17,416 --> 00:53:20,309
We knew it was going to be hard.
Look, we can't give up now.

455
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:22,767
No. No, it's no good.
We'll have to turn back.

456
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:25,017
Stop! Stop!

457
00:53:25,041 --> 00:53:27,476
We have to get out of the mist!
We have to turn back!

458
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,267
It's her, isn't it?

459
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:31,226
What has she done to you?

460
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,976
We can't be out here!

461
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,059
Shit!
Which way's South?

462
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:36,934
What?
I can't hear you.

463
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:41,833
What was that?

464
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,541
Bickley, what was that?
Quiet, sir!

465
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:51,208
It's a ship.

466
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,017
Hello!

467
00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:56,601
Hello?
Can you hear me?

468
00:53:56,625 --> 00:53:58,892
A light!
Head for the light.

469
00:53:58,916 --> 00:54:01,559
No! No, turn about!

470
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:03,726
Stay away from the light!

471
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,767
Oh! Oh!

472
00:54:22,791 --> 00:54:24,934
Oh, my God!
We need to help them!

473
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:27,476
I, I don't know where they are!
It's like they're all around us!

474
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,684
Where, where are you?
Swim to us!

475
00:54:29,708 --> 00:54:31,434
Swim to us!

476
00:54:31,458 --> 00:54:34,684
Bickley! Help me!

477
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:36,434
Ferris?

478
00:54:36,458 --> 00:54:37,726
What?

479
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:39,226
I heard him calling me.

480
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:41,601
That's impossible.
He called my name!

481
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:43,934
Ferris! Ferris!

482
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:46,767
Ferris! Ferris!

483
00:54:46,791 --> 00:54:48,684
It's coming towards us!

484
00:54:58,208 --> 00:55:00,809
Oliver! Jim!

485
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:04,101
Can you hear me?
Come back to shore!

486
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,392
Quickly! Come with me!
We have to help them!

487
00:55:22,416 --> 00:55:24,684
There's a ship that's
broken up on the rocks!

488
00:55:24,708 --> 00:55:26,684
We need to do something, Fingal!

489
00:55:26,708 --> 00:55:28,476
No, we don't!

490
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,559
Get inside.
They're drowning out there!

491
00:55:30,583 --> 00:55:33,166
We heard them!
MacLeod!

492
00:55:53,166 --> 00:55:55,601
Sit.
Fingal, why won't you help them?

493
00:55:55,625 --> 00:55:58,642
There was no boat tonight!

494
00:55:58,666 --> 00:56:02,083
We heard...
What you heard happened five years ago.

495
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:07,517
When the food plight
really took hold,

496
00:56:07,541 --> 00:56:09,392
our boys stayed out
at sea for days,

497
00:56:09,416 --> 00:56:12,351
trying to catch
anything they could.

498
00:56:12,375 --> 00:56:16,851
One night, they got caught
in a dreadful storm,

499
00:56:16,875 --> 00:56:19,392
the likes none of us
had witnessed before.

500
00:56:19,416 --> 00:56:22,434
And you think that's what we heard?
I know that's what you heard.

501
00:56:22,458 --> 00:56:24,434
I hear it.

502
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:26,892
Hear them calling for my help.

503
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:30,000
I think you've been
alone here too long.

504
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:36,125
Sit.

505
00:56:46,625 --> 00:56:48,392
A few years back,

506
00:56:48,416 --> 00:56:51,517
I found the body of a young
woman washed up on the shore.

507
00:56:53,416 --> 00:56:55,666
Aye, it was a fine evening.

508
00:56:56,958 --> 00:56:59,434
Ah, but I think
my dancing days are over.

509
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:01,142
Did you ever have any?

510
00:57:01,166 --> 00:57:04,434
I'll have you know I cut
a fine caper in my day.

511
00:57:04,458 --> 00:57:06,642
Here, your Korrigan
was in fine form.

512
00:57:06,666 --> 00:57:09,642
Aye. Had to drag
her away in the end.

513
00:57:09,666 --> 00:57:12,166
Jacob was in a strange mood.

514
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:14,976
Ah.

515
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,976
Our Billy's always
in a strange mood.

516
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,017
What's he up to now?
Better go and fetch him.

517
00:57:22,041 --> 00:57:23,916
Aye. Come on then.

518
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:40,059
It wasn't long after that

519
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:42,517
that the crops started failing.

520
00:57:42,541 --> 00:57:44,767
Nothing would grow.

521
00:57:44,791 --> 00:57:48,267
The livestock took ill
and slowly died.

522
00:57:48,291 --> 00:57:50,101
People's livelihoods
were destroyed.

523
00:57:50,125 --> 00:57:52,517
Whole families were starving

524
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:54,958
and had no choice but to leave.

525
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:59,309
It's a curse placed
on the island...

526
00:57:59,333 --> 00:58:01,017
by her.

527
00:58:01,041 --> 00:58:04,476
By who?
The drowned woman?

528
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,559
I call her Persephone.

529
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:08,684
After the Greek myth.

530
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:10,458
What?

531
00:58:12,333 --> 00:58:16,726
I read it in Fingal's book. She was
known as the goddess of death.

532
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:19,476
Persephone was
abducted by Hades,

533
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,351
and it was believed that,
because of this,

534
00:58:22,375 --> 00:58:24,851
nothing grew
and the people starved.

535
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:27,559
What's that got to do
with shipwrecked fishermen?

536
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:30,226
It's her curse.

537
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:33,500
She torments us
with the sound of death.

538
00:58:50,208 --> 00:58:51,809
Where have you been?

539
00:58:51,833 --> 00:58:54,000
What are you doing
sitting in the dark, man?

540
00:58:55,791 --> 00:58:57,434
Where are they?

541
00:58:57,458 --> 00:58:59,476
I don't know.
Where are they, Lanthe?

542
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,892
I was out looking for them.

543
00:59:01,916 --> 00:59:04,541
Don't lie to me! Lanthe.

544
00:59:10,041 --> 00:59:12,309
No!
No! Upstairs.

545
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:13,934
No!
It's for your own good!

546
00:59:13,958 --> 00:59:15,601
No, Uncle! Please don't!

547
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:17,458
I can help! No!

548
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:28,708
You!

549
00:59:31,166 --> 00:59:33,434
I want a word with you.

550
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:36,517
I've warned you before.

551
00:59:36,541 --> 00:59:39,875
I don't want you going
anywhere near her!

552
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:44,642
I saw the two of you
up by the farm.

553
00:59:44,666 --> 00:59:47,416
You know you can't be
talking to Lanthe.

554
00:59:48,416 --> 00:59:50,226
I know what's happening!

555
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:53,809
You keep away from her!

556
00:59:53,833 --> 00:59:55,809
You go back to the cottage,

557
00:59:55,833 --> 00:59:57,934
and I'll go and see
what the commotion is about.

558
00:59:57,958 --> 00:59:59,851
Would you like me
to come with you?

559
00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:02,500
No, you go back.
And stay inside.

560
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,851
"Persephone had
two sirens as companions.

561
01:00:08,875 --> 01:00:11,851
When they failed to stop
her abduction by Hades,

562
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:14,851
their song, a beautiful,
sad melody,

563
01:00:14,875 --> 01:00:17,767
eternally called for her return.

564
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:21,559
It lured ships
onto the rocks."

565
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:22,726
Ships...

566
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:25,642
Stop! Stop!

567
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:27,934
Turn back! Turn back!

568
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:30,142
I tried to help
them, but they couldn't hear me.

569
01:00:30,166 --> 01:00:32,767
That awful deafening sound.

570
01:00:32,791 --> 01:00:35,434
I still hear it constantly
in my head...

571
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:39,416
The cries of all those poor,
lost souls.

572
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,392
More families have left.

573
01:00:43,416 --> 01:00:45,583
Fled in fear.

574
01:00:51,833 --> 01:00:53,642
This is going to have to stop.

575
01:00:53,666 --> 01:00:56,267
You're gonna end up killing her.

576
01:00:56,291 --> 01:00:57,916
I'm trying.

577
01:00:59,791 --> 01:01:01,958
What are you doing, man?

578
01:01:07,291 --> 01:01:09,309
What's got into you,
for goodness sake?

579
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:11,184
Come off it, MacLeod.

580
01:01:11,208 --> 01:01:13,642
You know as well as I do
this is happening again.

581
01:01:13,666 --> 01:01:15,601
We don't know that.

582
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:16,934
Your daughter is dangerous.

583
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:19,017
You to keep a closer eye on her.

584
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:21,708
And I suppose your Lanthe is
doing well, is she? Coping?

585
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:27,250
We just need to keep them
away from each other.

586
01:01:29,041 --> 01:01:31,625
Aye. Agreed.

587
01:02:08,416 --> 01:02:12,476
What have you got there?
We were right.

588
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:15,309
There is no supply boat.

589
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:17,892
The last boat logged
was a year ago,

590
01:02:17,916 --> 01:02:19,851
almost to the day.

591
01:02:19,875 --> 01:02:21,250
Look what happened to it.

592
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:25,101
"All souls lost."

593
01:02:25,125 --> 01:02:26,601
Here's another.

594
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:29,333
Almost the same date
the year before.

595
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,541
"All souls lost."

596
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:40,666
Bickley...

597
01:02:47,833 --> 01:02:50,517
Now, what do you say
to another drop of rum,

598
01:02:50,541 --> 01:02:52,625
to keep the nightmares at bay?

599
01:03:17,916 --> 01:03:19,684
No.

600
01:03:19,708 --> 01:03:20,916
Sir?

601
01:03:22,166 --> 01:03:24,517
You go on ahead,
Bickley. I...

602
01:03:24,541 --> 01:03:27,142
I think I might explore
the island a little.

603
01:03:27,166 --> 01:03:30,142
Are you sure, sir? I really
think we should stick together.

604
01:03:30,166 --> 01:03:33,291
I just want to try and find out a little
more about what actually happened here.

605
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,809
Something's very much amiss,

606
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:40,041
but I refuse to believe that
a mythical being is to blame.

607
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:43,166
What?

608
01:03:45,208 --> 01:03:48,059
I'll see you back
at the farmhouse, Jim.

609
01:03:48,083 --> 01:03:50,125
I won't be long.

610
01:05:03,083 --> 01:05:05,250
Oliver.

611
01:05:06,375 --> 01:05:07,875
Hello?

612
01:05:10,541 --> 01:05:11,958
Hello?

613
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:23,291
Hello?

614
01:05:26,833 --> 01:05:28,166
Hello?

615
01:05:29,666 --> 01:05:33,208
Hello!

616
01:06:48,541 --> 01:06:51,583
September 20, 1840.

617
01:06:53,083 --> 01:06:55,851
Tonight is the Mabon dance.

618
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:58,559
The village is alive
with comings and goings,

619
01:06:58,583 --> 01:07:02,184
everyone gathering what they can to
celebrate the last of the harvest

620
01:07:02,208 --> 01:07:04,559
and stockpiling
for the long, dark days ahead.

621
01:07:04,583 --> 01:07:05,976
Morning, Lorna.

622
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,017
Our bounteous isle giving way

623
01:07:08,041 --> 01:07:10,708
to the inevitable
cold grasp of winter.

624
01:07:12,583 --> 01:07:14,309
I went out this morning.

625
01:07:14,333 --> 01:07:16,226
Managed to hit
a couple more brace of grouse

626
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:18,976
and bumped into Lorna Elliot.

627
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,267
Morning, Jacob.
How are you on this fine day?

628
01:07:22,291 --> 01:07:25,351
Very well, thank you.

629
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:27,726
I hope I'll be seeing
you at the dance.

630
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:29,684
I wouldn't miss it for anything.

631
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:32,333
I'm off to pick flowers
for the hall now.

632
01:07:35,041 --> 01:07:38,392
I actually managed to pluck up the
courage and ask her for a dance.

633
01:07:38,416 --> 01:07:40,184
Save a dance for me.

634
01:07:40,208 --> 01:07:42,017
Maybe she does like me.

635
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:45,017
Ridiculous.
Running away with myself.

636
01:07:45,041 --> 01:07:47,642
She only smiled at me,
for God's sake.

637
01:07:47,666 --> 01:07:50,017
And there's Billy Innis,
of course.

638
01:07:50,041 --> 01:07:51,934
He'll be prowling around her,

639
01:07:51,958 --> 01:07:54,309
marking his territory
as if she belongs to him.

640
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:55,476
I was hoping I'd see you here.
Oh!

641
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:56,976
I didn't see you there.

642
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,476
Hope I didn't frighten you.
No. No.

643
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:03,684
I just need to get these
flowers picked for tonight.

644
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:05,517
Funny you should mention that.

645
01:08:05,541 --> 01:08:07,351
What time should I pick you up?

646
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,476
Oh, no, I'm fine.

647
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,434
I'll make my own way there.

648
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:12,916
Thank you.

649
01:08:13,833 --> 01:08:16,142
But I'll see you there.

650
01:08:16,166 --> 01:08:17,500
Good day.

651
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:55,083
Right!

652
01:09:00,541 --> 01:09:03,166
Come on!
Show yourself!

653
01:09:04,125 --> 01:09:05,916
Where are you?

654
01:09:19,458 --> 01:09:21,226
It was a bonnie night.

655
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:23,351
Everyone was in high spirits.

656
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:26,375
Douglas Innis could
barely stand by the end.

657
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:30,059
I saw something on my way home,

658
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:32,000
and I've been turning it
over and over.

659
01:09:34,291 --> 01:09:37,142
At first I couldn't make out
who it was with Billy.

660
01:09:37,166 --> 01:09:39,041
And then I saw her dress.

661
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:42,726
It just doesn't make any sense.

662
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:45,392
She'd been dancing
with me all night.

663
01:09:45,416 --> 01:09:48,184
What are you reading?

664
01:09:48,208 --> 01:09:49,833
Lanthe!

665
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:04,291
I'm sorry I left. I...
It's fine.

666
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:07,517
We had to bury Ferris.

667
01:10:07,541 --> 01:10:09,416
I said it's fine.

668
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,125
Lanthe, I...

669
01:10:15,916 --> 01:10:18,809
Why did you go out in the dark?

670
01:10:18,833 --> 01:10:20,375
It isn't safe.

671
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,125
What happened?

672
01:10:28,333 --> 01:10:29,916
It's nothing.

673
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:37,976
We have to get off this island,

674
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,250
and you have to come with us.

675
01:10:47,875 --> 01:10:49,458
They won't let me.

676
01:10:52,375 --> 01:10:53,833
Who won't?

677
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,958
It doesn't matter.

678
01:11:26,125 --> 01:11:28,476
You have to stay away from me.

679
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:34,875
Lanthe. Lanthe!

680
01:11:38,541 --> 01:11:40,541
Lanthe, please.

681
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,559
Let me help you.

682
01:11:43,583 --> 01:11:46,601
Leave me alone!

683
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:33,601
Jacob! Jacob!

684
01:12:38,291 --> 01:12:41,226
God's sake.
Were you born in a field?

685
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:43,041
You're letting...

686
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:47,267
Bickley?

687
01:12:47,291 --> 01:12:49,583
Oh, damn it.
Bickley!

688
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:02,333
Jim!

689
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:05,416
Jim!

690
01:13:10,791 --> 01:13:12,875
Jim!

691
01:13:56,791 --> 01:13:58,250
Oliver.

692
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:01,333
You need to get up.

693
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:04,666
Something's happened.

694
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,642
No.

695
01:14:10,666 --> 01:14:12,726
Jacob, please, no!

696
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:15,517
That's not Jacob, Korrigan.
Leave him be.

697
01:14:15,541 --> 01:14:18,476
But she killed him!

698
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,976
Please, Korrigan, darling,
come away now.

699
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,083
No.
Oh, dear God.

700
01:14:25,125 --> 01:14:27,434
Please, no, no!

701
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:30,059
She did this.

702
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:31,642
You killed him.

703
01:14:31,666 --> 01:14:34,434
You know I didn't do this,
Korrigan.

704
01:14:36,875 --> 01:14:39,976
Korrigan!
Take hold of her!

705
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,166
Get hold of her, Fingal.

706
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,958
Lanthe?

707
01:14:48,333 --> 01:14:50,476
What's happening to her?

708
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,833
Fingal, please!
Hold her still.

709
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,833
Hold her head steady.

710
01:15:02,333 --> 01:15:05,267
Shh, Lanthe.
Lanthe, it's all right.

711
01:15:05,291 --> 01:15:08,500
It's all right. Shh.

712
01:15:09,333 --> 01:15:11,500
Lanthe?

713
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:31,684
Lanthe! Where the
hell have you been, Innis?

714
01:15:31,708 --> 01:15:33,184
Lanthe!
What happened?

715
01:15:33,208 --> 01:15:35,517
She had one of her fits.
Where were you?

716
01:15:35,541 --> 01:15:37,976
I had to go out searching
for that idiot, Bickley.

717
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,851
He took off in the night.
Then the mist came down.

718
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:43,059
My lantern went out.
I had to shelter till light.

719
01:15:43,083 --> 01:15:45,583
Well, "that idiot Bickley"
is dead.

720
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,351
Enough!

721
01:15:56,375 --> 01:15:58,642
No more excuses.

722
01:15:58,666 --> 01:16:01,476
What the hell is going on? You tell
me the truth, and you tell me now!

723
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:04,184
Calm down, Oliver.
You're scared. I understand.

724
01:16:04,208 --> 01:16:06,267
Of course I'm fucking scared!
Will you...

725
01:16:06,291 --> 01:16:09,309
You stay away from me.
You be quiet, Oliver.

726
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:13,851
Lanthe is upstairs sleeping.
Now, get control of yourself.

727
01:16:13,875 --> 01:16:15,601
I want to know what is going on,

728
01:16:15,625 --> 01:16:17,726
and then I want to get off
this God forsaken island.

729
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:21,208
And we want to help you, Oliver.
Will you just listen?

730
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:26,166
Remember that drowned woman
I told you about?

731
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:29,375
Yes.

732
01:16:30,583 --> 01:16:33,309
The night before I found her,

733
01:16:33,333 --> 01:16:35,642
there'd been a dance.

734
01:16:35,666 --> 01:16:38,684
Evening, Billy. Good night for it.
Aye.

735
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:41,541
Good to see you're
pacing yourself, lad.

736
01:16:44,583 --> 01:16:47,375
Take it easy, son.

737
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,767
I haven't seen you dancing
much this evening, Billy.

738
01:16:52,791 --> 01:16:55,101
You're dancing enough
for the whole family.

739
01:16:55,125 --> 01:16:57,517
Oh, you're such a killjoy,
William Innis.

740
01:16:57,541 --> 01:17:00,726
Well, I might consider it if
my woman would dance with me.

741
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:02,476
Oh, and who might
that be, Billy?

742
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,601
I hope that's not me
you're referring to.

743
01:17:04,625 --> 01:17:06,392
I'm nobody's woman.

744
01:17:06,416 --> 01:17:09,642
Aye, until it suits you, Lorna.
Says you, you strumpet.

745
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:12,267
I'm not the one that's been flirting
with Davey Campbell all evening.

746
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:15,958
Oh, ho, ho! I'll have no sister
of mine talking to a Campbell!

747
01:17:19,875 --> 01:17:22,559
Well, I'm ready
for another reel.

748
01:17:22,583 --> 01:17:25,392
Aye. Maybe a wee bit more
of that punch as well.

749
01:17:25,416 --> 01:17:28,309
I think I might head back.
I'm feeling pretty tired.

750
01:17:28,333 --> 01:17:30,625
As you wish.
Mind how you go.

751
01:17:33,375 --> 01:17:35,017
I'll keep you
company if you like.

752
01:17:35,041 --> 01:17:36,642
No, I'll take her home.
Billy...

753
01:17:36,666 --> 01:17:39,559
No worries.
I'll be fine on my own.

754
01:17:39,583 --> 01:17:41,875
I'll see you
in the morning, Jacob.

755
01:17:48,583 --> 01:17:50,767
Come on.
Let's have a drink.

756
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:52,934
Listen, MacLeod!

757
01:17:52,958 --> 01:17:55,351
She and I have an understanding.

758
01:17:55,375 --> 01:17:57,541
She doesn't think so, Billy.

759
01:17:58,833 --> 01:18:00,892
Are you saying I'm lying?

760
01:18:07,541 --> 01:18:09,517
What's going on here?

761
01:18:09,541 --> 01:18:11,875
Nothing, Uncle.

762
01:18:13,125 --> 01:18:16,226
Jacob, your the wants to...

763
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:18,166
Better go in to...

764
01:18:27,208 --> 01:18:29,000
Billy...

765
01:18:29,833 --> 01:18:31,375
I'll be in.

766
01:19:20,333 --> 01:19:22,601
Stop, you...

767
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:25,809
Stop! Stay quiet, woman!
Shut it!

768
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:28,559
We don't want anyone to hear.

769
01:19:28,583 --> 01:19:31,559
This has to be our secret, okay?

770
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:35,601
Okay?

771
01:20:09,291 --> 01:20:11,101
Quiet!

772
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:14,476
Shush!

773
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,500
Stay still, for fuck's sake!

774
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:47,559
No.
No, please don't.

775
01:20:47,583 --> 01:20:51,434
Wake up. Wake up!
Please...

776
01:20:51,458 --> 01:20:54,059
No, please don't.

777
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:56,434
I'm s...
I'm sorry.

778
01:20:56,458 --> 01:20:59,375
I didn't mean to.

779
01:21:00,666 --> 01:21:03,267
Lorna Elliot.

780
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:04,958
Poor thing.

781
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:12,351
She must have fallen over the cliffs
on her way home from the dance.

782
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:14,601
This was no accident, Douglas.

783
01:21:14,625 --> 01:21:17,184
Look at the bruising.

784
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:20,226
What if this was
one of our lads?

785
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:23,517
You said you'd caught them
arguing over her last night.

786
01:21:23,541 --> 01:21:26,017
God, Fingal.

787
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:28,226
You know what this'll mean.

788
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,791
They'll come here
looking for who did this.

789
01:21:33,083 --> 01:21:35,166
Someone will hang.

790
01:21:37,958 --> 01:21:39,767
Right.

791
01:21:39,791 --> 01:21:42,267
We'll bury her properly at sea.

792
01:21:42,291 --> 01:21:44,601
Then we'll never
speak of this again.

793
01:21:44,625 --> 01:21:47,309
We can't do that.
What about her family?

794
01:21:47,333 --> 01:21:49,559
What about our families?

795
01:21:49,583 --> 01:21:51,892
Billy? Your Jacob?

796
01:21:51,916 --> 01:21:53,708
They're young men.

797
01:21:55,875 --> 01:21:58,309
Aye.

798
01:21:58,333 --> 01:22:00,809
They've both got
their lives ahead of them.

799
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:02,791
So you covered it up.

800
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:07,017
And no one knew
what happened to her?

801
01:22:07,041 --> 01:22:09,916
Aye. And now
she haunts us.

802
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:15,309
She uses the women.
She controls them.

803
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:17,434
Lanthe and Korrigan
don't know what they're doing,

804
01:22:17,458 --> 01:22:19,916
and we're powerless to stop her.

805
01:22:21,958 --> 01:22:25,142
Then all of you need
to get off the island.

806
01:22:25,166 --> 01:22:27,583
Do you not think we've tried?

807
01:22:31,416 --> 01:22:33,166
Where are they?

808
01:22:38,041 --> 01:22:39,767
No.

809
01:22:39,791 --> 01:22:41,476
No, no, no, no, please.

810
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:44,476
Please.
Korrigan. Korrigan!

811
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,767
Korrigan! It's Jacob. It's me!
It's your brother!

812
01:23:12,791 --> 01:23:15,642
Stop!
Please stop!

813
01:23:15,666 --> 01:23:17,892
Jacob! Jacob!

814
01:23:21,083 --> 01:23:24,017
She'll never let us forget.
Jacob!

815
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:26,892
This is our punishment...

816
01:23:26,916 --> 01:23:31,166
To have to watch our innocent
girls take everyone we care for.

817
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,208
We'll have to try and get you away
from here as soon as possible.

818
01:23:42,375 --> 01:23:43,976
I'll make sure
Lanthe can't get out.

819
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,226
Oliver, you get
your things together.

820
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:49,267
Fingal and I will then make sure
that Korrigan's locked up.

821
01:23:49,291 --> 01:23:50,666
We'll meet you on the beach.

822
01:23:52,458 --> 01:23:54,000
Douglas...

823
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:16,708
See that Lanthe
gets that, please.

824
01:24:36,333 --> 01:24:37,958
Lanthe...

825
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:41,416
I'm sorry.

826
01:24:45,458 --> 01:24:47,559
I know.

827
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:49,809
It's all right.

828
01:24:49,833 --> 01:24:51,625
Good girl.

829
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:54,517
Quick, lad. In.

830
01:25:54,541 --> 01:25:57,184
Oliver!
You need to get away.

831
01:25:57,208 --> 01:26:00,017
Keep true North for six miles,
then North-Northeast,

832
01:26:00,041 --> 01:26:02,726
and the gods willing, you'll
find the mainland eventually.

833
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:05,184
Here. You're going to need these.
Put them in your ears.

834
01:26:05,208 --> 01:26:08,142
Don't take them out till
you're away from the mist.

835
01:26:08,166 --> 01:26:10,184
It's their song.

836
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:11,934
That's why we wrecked in the first place.
Aye, aye, aye.

837
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:14,226
And if you hear it, you'll be powerless.
Now, come on.

838
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:16,684
The wax. It worked
for Odysseus laddie.

839
01:26:16,708 --> 01:26:19,809
Whatever happens,
don't take them out.

840
01:26:19,833 --> 01:26:23,333
Good luck. Try not to think
too harshly of us.

841
01:26:25,541 --> 01:26:27,500
Thank you, gentlemen.

842
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:37,892
Lanthe?

843
01:26:37,916 --> 01:26:41,642
We have to stop him.
They've helped him escape.

844
01:26:41,666 --> 01:26:45,142
You...
He must not leave!

845
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:47,351
You know what'll happen to us.

846
01:26:47,375 --> 01:26:50,833
I'll not help you anymore.
Let her go.

847
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:55,017
Lanthe, listen to me.

848
01:26:55,041 --> 01:26:57,083
You have to fight her.
Lanthe!

849
01:27:09,291 --> 01:27:13,333
You will
do as we want, Korrigan.

850
01:27:43,041 --> 01:27:44,976
He's on his own now.

851
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,625
Aye.

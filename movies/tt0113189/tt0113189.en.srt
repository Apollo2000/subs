1
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,437
Beg your pardon. Forgot to knock.

2
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,776
<i>Ni odnoho vyzdoha. Gdye vashy?</i>

3
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:57,945
I'm alone.

4
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,993
Aren't we all?

5
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,664
-You're late, 007.
-I had to stop in the bathroom.

6
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,627
-Ready to save the world again?
-After you, 006.

7
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:22,136
-James... For England.
-For England, Alec.

8
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,142
-It's too easy.
-Half of everything is luck, James.

9
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,979
And the other half?

10
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,691
Fate.

11
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,277
-Set timers: six minutes.
-Six minutes. Check.

12
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,557
Fire.

13
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,187
-Closing time, James. Last call.
-Buy me a pint.

14
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,791
This is Colonel Ourumov.
Come out with your hands up.

15
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,460
How original.

16
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,300
Shut the door, Alec. There's a draught.

17
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,180
Alec?

18
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:45,654
Move out. Throw down your weapon
and walk towards me, slowly.

19
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:49,575
-Finish the job, James. Blow them to hell.
-You have ten seconds.

20
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,370
Ten,

21
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,665
nine, eight,

22
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,835
seven, six,

23
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,589
five, four,

24
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,258
-three, two...
-For England, James.

25
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:12,389
Hold your fire. You'll blow the gas tanks.

26
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,269
This is your last chance.
Come out with your hands...

27
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,235
Wait.

28
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,027
You can't win.

29
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,217
Get out there. Move. Move it.

30
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,358
Hold your fire.

31
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,063
Wait.

32
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,824
-James, is it necessary to drive so fast?
-More often than you'd think.

33
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:59,838
I enjoy a spirited ride
as much as the next girl, but...

34
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,470
-Who's that?
-The next girl.

35
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,120
James, stop this. Stop it.

36
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,456
-I know what you're doing.
-What's that, dear?

37
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,793
You are just trying to show off
the size of your...

38
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,962
-Engine?
-Ego.

39
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,924
We're having a pleasant drive
and you bring psychology into it.

40
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:30,470
-I was just sent here to evaluate you.
-Let's put that behind us, shall we?

41
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,092
Ladies first.

42
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,901
James, I want you to stop this car.

43
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,528
-Really?
-Stop this car at once.

44
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:40,123
As you can see, I have no problem
with female authority.

45
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,341
James, you're incorrigible.

46
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,344
What am I going to do with you?

47
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,764
Let's toast your evaluation, shall we?

48
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,231
A very thorough evaluation.

49
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,173
<i>Bonsoir, Monsieur Bond.</i>
<i>Très heureux de vous revoir.</i>

50
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:34,553
<i>-Bonsoir, Pierre. Ça va bien?</i>
<i>-Très bien. Et vous?</i>

51
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,367
<i>Sept à la banque.</i>

52
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,704
Madame wins.

53
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,088
Bet, mademoiselle? Non?

54
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,716
Monsieur.

55
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,885
Bets, ladies and gentlemen?

56
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,596
-No players?
<i>-Banco.</i>

57
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,530
It appears we share the same passions.

58
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,491
Three, anyway.

59
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:42,245
I count two -motoring and baccarat.

60
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,291
<i>Huit, pour la banque.</i>

61
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,962
Seven. Madame wins.

62
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:54,883
I hope the third
is where your real talent lies.

63
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,177
One rises to meet a challenge.

64
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,640
<i>Double.</i>

65
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,976
<i>Suivez.</i>

66
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,657
<i>Carte.</i>

67
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,633
Madame stands with five.

68
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:44,057
-Six. Madame loses.
<i>-Buliatch.</i>

69
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:50,605
-Enjoy it while it lasts.
-The very words I live by.

70
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,072
And what words do you live by?

71
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:04,286
-The trick is to quit while you're ahead.
-That's one trick I've never learned.

72
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,663
Perhaps you'll show me how it's done.

73
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:10,458
Vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred.

74
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,627
And for you?

75
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,880
The same.

76
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,048
How do you take it?

77
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:20,385
Straight up, with a twist.

78
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,973
Thank you, Mr...

79
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,226
The name's Bond. James Bond.

80
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,812
Xenia Zaragevna Onatopp.

81
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,025
-Onatopp?
-Onatopp.

82
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:40,071
-Your accent... Georgian?
-Very good, Mr Bond.

83
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,157
-You've been to Russia.
-Not recently.

84
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,535
I used to drop in occasionally.
Shoot in and out.

85
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:50,332
It's very different now.
A land of opportunity.

86
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:54,085
With a new Ferrari in every garage?

87
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,589
No, not quite. That belongs to a friend.

88
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:03,428
A tip for your friend: the French number
plates for this year's model start with "L".

89
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,096
Even the counterfeit ones.

90
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:13,521
And what rank do you hold with
the motor vehicles department, Mr Bond?

91
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,065
Commander.

92
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,525
Shall we go?

93
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,570
This one is an admiral.

94
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,114
I like a woman who enjoys pulling rank.

95
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,743
Nice to meet you, Mr Bond.

96
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,913
The pleasure, I'm sure, was all mine.

97
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,377
<i>Transmission begins from Moneypenny.</i>

98

106
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:11,741
Xenia, I can't breathe.

107
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,128
Yes! Yes!

108
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,769
<i>Merci, mon amiral.</i>

109
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,488
My respects, Admiral.

110
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:38,369
Delighted to have you aboard,
mademoiselle.

111
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,916
Ladies and gentlemen,

112
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,378
please take your seats
for the demonstration of the aircraft.

113
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:25,416
What you are about to see is Europe's
answer to the electronic battlefield:

114
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:29,128
the first working prototype
of the Tiger helicopter.

115
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:32,966
Uniquely manoeuvrable, the Tiger
not only uses Stealth technology,

116
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:37,262
it is hardened against all forms
of electronic interference,

117
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:40,181
radio jamming
and electromagnetic radiation.

118
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,319
I have a small surprise from
your friends at the barracks.

119
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,446
I think I've gone to heaven.

120
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,240
Not yet.

121
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,334
Please welcome the pilots.

122
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:15,425
Lieutenant Commander Bernard Jaubert
and Lieutenant François Brouse.

123
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,119
Select Mir.

124
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:28,122
Orthographic projection.

125
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:34,087
Compute possible intercept
with second-stage geo-sat two.

126
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:42,970
Anna.

127
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:49,644
He wouldn't know a woman
if one came up and sat on his head.

128
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,732
Boris.

129
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,569
What?

130
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,448
I thought I'd post it
on the Internet, no?

131
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:05,910
-What's the password?
-I made it easy this time.

132
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,664
Even you should be able to break it,
borscht-for-brains.

133
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,960
All right. All right. I'll give you a hint.

134
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:19,799
They're right in front of you
and can open very large doors.

135
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,428
You're such a geek.

136
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,097
Yes. I'm in.

137
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,857
You've hacked into
the US Department of Justice.

138
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,942
What if they trace it here?

139
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:42,155
The chief of computers will call me
a genius, move me to Moscow

140
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:45,783
and give me a million bucks
hard currency.

141
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,828
I think not.

142
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:52,999
Besides, the Americans are slug-heads.
They'll never detect me.

143
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:57,003
You were saying, slug-head?

144
00:29:57,087 --> 00:30:00,173
Nobody screws with Boris Grishenko.

145
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:05,136
-Spiked them.
-Come on, Boris. Just hang up.

146
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,138
No way. I spiked them.

147
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:14,562
-All right. What's the password?
-I'm not going to tell you.

148
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,398
OK. Let me guess.

149
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,485
It's not in front of me?

150
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:24,155
You sit on it,
but you can't take it with you.

151
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,413
My program seizes the phone line
of whoever's tracing me

152
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:35,833
and jams their modem
so they can't hang up.

153
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,837
Now the hunted becomes the hunter.

154
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:46,344
"Better luck next time,

155
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,262
"slug-heads."

156
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,725
Bang. Gone. I am invincible.

157
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,733
Was it good for you, too?

158
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,402
I'm getting some coffee.

159
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,613
I'm going for a cigarette.

160
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:14,974
General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov,
head of Space Division.

161
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,155
-General, if I'd known...
-You'd have been ready.

162
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:33,451
This is an unscheduled test
of Severnaya, Major. War simulation.

163
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,871
We are going to test-fire GoldenEye.
Report your status.

164
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:42,710
Two operational satellites, sir, Petya and
Mischa, in 90-minute earth orbit at 1 00km.

165
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,378
Good.

166
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,547
Here is the authorisation code.

167
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:51,052
Now, the GoldenEye and today's access
numbers for satellite Petya, please.

168
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,138
I am timing you.

169
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:27,838
Good. Thank you, Major.

170
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,044
On my count.

171
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:10,548
Three, two, one...

172
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:21,392
Set target. Severnaya.

173
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:35,072
Arm the weapon.

174
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:01,682
Check it.

175
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:16,489
Their best response time
is 1 9 minutes. They'll be late.

176
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:54,401
It's clean. I had to ventilate someone.

177
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,941
-Good evening, Moneypenny.
-Good evening, James.

178
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:37,611
M will meet you in the Situation Room.
I'm to take you in.

179
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,948
-Never seen you after hours. Lovely.
-Thank you, James.

180
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,702
Out on some kind of assignment?
Dressing to kill?

181
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,371
I know you'll find this crushing, 007,

182
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:51,250
but I don't sit at home
praying for an international incident

183
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:54,712
so I can run down here
all dressed up to impress James Bond.

184
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,716
I was on a date with a gentleman.
We went to the theatre.

185
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:01,218
Moneypenny, I'm devastated.

186
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,637
What would I ever do without you?

187
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:07,892
As far as I can remember, James,
you've never had me.

188
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:13,397
Hope springs eternal.

189
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:17,192
This sort of behaviour
could qualify as sexual harassment.

190
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:20,738
Really? What's the penalty for that?

191
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:23,949
Someday you have to make good
on your innuendoes.

192
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:32,541
-After you, Moneypenny.
-No, I insist. You first.

193
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,341
-Good evening, 007.
-Tanner. What's up?

194
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:43,093
1 6 minutes ago,
we intercepted a distress call

195
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:47,181
from a supposedly abandoned
radar station at Severnaya. Look.

196
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:56,941
-We found a match. Your missing Tiger.
-In the middle of northern Russia?

197
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:01,445
Your hunch was right. Too bad the evil
queen of numbers wouldn't let you play it.

198
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:09,328
-You were saying?
-No, no. I was just...just...

199
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:13,874
Good. Because if I want sarcasm, I'll
talk to my children, thank you very much.

200
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,628
-Good evening, 007.
-Good evening, M.

201
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:21,090
The prime minister's
waiting for an update.

202
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:24,051
Proceed with your briefing, Mr Tanner.

203
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,303
Thank you.

204
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:30,349
Yes, after the distress signal,
your helicopter took off

205
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:33,060
and the Russians
had three MiGs intercept it.

206
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,729
What do you think the base is used for?

207
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,565
We suspected it might be
the ground station

208
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,569
for a secret space-based
weapon called GoldenEye, but...

209
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:47,616
Our statistical analysis saw they had
neither the finance nor technology.

210
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,284
Numbers were never my strong suit.

211
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,330
Are these pictures live?

212
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:57,084
Unlike the American government, we
prefer not to get our bad news from CNN.

213
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,360
<i>Negative so far.</i>
<i>Everything seems normaI.</i>

214
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,258
What the bloody hell was that?

215
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,514
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.

216
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,595
Boris. Boris.

217
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:21,265
Thanks.

218
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:25,769
Our satellite is knocked out.
So are two of the Americans'.

219
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:31,441
We have another, coming into range now.

220
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,322
Good God.

221
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,701
Two of the MiGs are down.

222
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:43,203
It looks like the third went into the dish.

223
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,497
What do you think?

224
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:50,460
No lights. Not one single
electric light on in a 30-mile radius.

225
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,715
-EMP?
-It would explain the MiGs and satellites.

226
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:57,509
-And the blackout.
-Electromagnetic pulse.

227
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:02,681
-A satellite weapon developed by the...
-Americans and Soviets in the Cold War.

228
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,683
I've read the brief.

229
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:09,438
Discovered after Hiroshima. Set off
a nuclear device in the upper atmosphere.

230
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:14,609
Creates a pulse, a radiation surge,
that destroys everything electronic.

231
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:19,990
The idea being to knock out the enemy's
communications before they can retaliate.

232
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,577
So, GoldenEye exists.

233
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:25,787
Yes.

234
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,541
-Could this be an accident?
-No. The helicopter.

235
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:33,337
For stealing the GoldenEye,
it was the perfect getaway vehicle.

236
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:36,798
Setting off the blast would
wipe out any trace of the crime.

237
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:41,511
-The Janus group?
-It may be linked to the helicopter.

238
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,598
I know the Russian fail-safe systems.

239
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:49,853
You just don't walk in and ask for the keys
to the bomb. You need the access codes.

240
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,237
There had to be an insider.

241
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:09,956
At least one person
probably knows who it is.

242
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:35,232
Very well, sir. Thank you. Good night.

243
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:41,822
The prime minister's talked to Moscow. It
was "an accident on a training exercise".

244
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:45,075
Governments change.
The lies stay the same.

245
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:47,160
What else do we know about Janus?

246
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:50,497
Top-flight arms dealers,
headquartered in St Petersburg.

247
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,542
Restocked the Iraqis during the Gulf War.

248
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:57,045
The head man's unreliably
described. No photographs.

249
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:02,509
The woman, Onatopp,
is our only confirmed contact.

250
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,430
-Would you care for a drink?
-Thank you.

251
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:10,225
-Your predecessor kept some cognac...
-I prefer bourbon.

252
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,185
-Ice?
-Yes.

253
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:25,991
We pulled the files on whoever may have
had access or authority at Severnaya.

254
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:30,120
The top name on the list's
an old friend of yours, I understand.

255
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,460
Ourumov. They made him a general.

256
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:39,546
He sees himself as the next
"iron man of Russia".

257
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:43,467
Our political analysts say
he doesn't fit the profile of a traitor.

258
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:47,554
Are these the same analysts who said
that GoldenEye couldn't exist?

259
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:52,642
Who said the helicopter posed no threat
and wasn't worth following?

260
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,897
You don't like me, Bond.
You don't like my methods.

261
00:46:56,981 --> 00:47:01,902
You think I'm an accountant, more
interested in numbers than your instincts.

262
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:04,529
-The thought had occurred to me.
-Good.

263
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,741
Because I think you're
a sexist, misogynist dinosaur,

264
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:11,912
a relic of the Cold War, whose
boyish charms, though wasted on me,

265
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:15,707
obviously appealed to that young woman
I sent out to evaluate you.

266
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,960
-Point taken.
-Not quite, 007.

267
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:22,797
If you think I don't have the balls
to send a man out to die,

268
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:25,383
your instincts are dead wrong.

269
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:28,386
I've no compunction
about sending you to your death.

270
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:34,226
But I won't do it on a whim, even
with your cavalier attitude towards life.

271
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,605
I want you to find GoldenEye.

272
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:42,067
Find who took it, what they plan
to do with it, and stop it.

273
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:44,819
If you come across Ourumov,
guilty or not,

274
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:50,158
don't run off on a vendetta. Avenging
Alec Trevelyan will not bring him back.

275
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:54,788
-You didn't get him killed.
-Neither did you. Don't make it personal.

276
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:57,832
Never.

277
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:03,421
Bond...

278
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:07,884
Come back alive.

279
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,802
Good morning, General Ourumov.

280
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:54,514
Defence Minister Mishkin... Gentlemen.

281
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:58,143
Please, deliver your report.

282
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:06,192
As you know, 72 hours ago, a secret
weapons system -codename GoldenEye-

283
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,236
was detonated over Severnaya.

284
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:12,949
As head of Space Division,
I personally undertook the investigation.

285
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:17,412
I have concluded this crime was
committed by Siberian separatists

286
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:20,123
seeking to create political unrest.

287
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:25,879
Regrettably, the peaceful work and the
hard-currency earnings of Severnaya

288
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,882
have been set back by several years.

289
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,884
Therefore, I tender my resignation.

290
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:37,599
It seems the council does not want
your head, Arkady Grigorovich.

291
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:41,227
Merely your assurance that
there are no other GoldenEyes.

292
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,980
I can give you that assurance,
Defence Minister.

293
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:46,483
And what of the two missing
Severnaya technicians?

294
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:53,948
I was aware only of the one.
Boris Grishenko.

295
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:56,910
There was a girl also, whose body
was not among the dead.

296
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:00,163
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.
A level-two programmer.

297
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,999
I will investigate immediately.

298
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:08,588
It would seem presumptuous to blame
this incident on Siberian separatists

299
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:13,134
before the whereabouts
of your own people are determined.

300
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:17,347
-Do you agree?
-Yes, Defence Minister.

301
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:21,101
Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

302
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:24,562
That will be all.

303
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:41,746
Morning, Q. Sorry about the leg. Skiing?

304
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:45,709
Hunting.

305
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:49,421
Right. Now pay attention, 007.

306
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,631
First, your new car.

307
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:56,136
BMW. Agile, five forward gears,
all-points radar.

308
00:50:56,679 --> 00:51:01,975
Self-destruct system. And, naturally,
all the usual refinements.

309
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,687
Now, this I'm particularly proud of.

310
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,690
Behind the headlights, Stinger missiles.

311
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:12,318
Excellent. Just the thing
for unwinding after a rough day.

312
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:19,409
Need I remind you, 007, that you have
a licence to kill, not break the traffic laws.

313
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,245
-I wouldn't think of it.
-Good.

314
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,622
Right. Let's get on
to more practical matters.

315
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:31,296
A typical leather belt.
Male, size 34, buckle, notch.

316
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:35,884
Have you finished?

317
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:37,302
-Yes.
-Good.

318
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:40,346
-A typical belt...
-Q, I'm familiar with that device.

319
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:45,018
Not one with a 75-foot
rappelling cord built into the buckle.

320
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:48,229
Fire, and out shoots a piton,

321
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:52,192
followed by a high-tensile wire
designed to support your weight.

322
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:55,653
I see. And what if I need
additional support?

323
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,114
It's tested for one, 007.

324
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:06,164
Flight 878 to St Petersburg.

325
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,627
X-ray document scanner.

326
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:14,005
A pen. This is a class 4 grenade.

327
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:17,675
Three clicks arms the four-second fuse.

328
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,678
Another three disarms it.

329
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:26,100
How long did you say the fuse was?

330
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:28,228
Grow up, 007.

331
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:32,941
-"The pen is mightier than the sword."
-Thanks to me, it is.

332
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:36,903
Look, let's ask Freddie here
to demonstrate for us.

333
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:41,449
Here we are. Sorry about this, Fred.
One, two, three.

334
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:50,959
-Don't say it.
-The writing's on the wall?

335
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,170
Along with the rest of him.

336
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,715
Now, 007, do please try and return...

337
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,639
Do try and return some of this
equipment in pristine order.

338
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,724
Don't touch that. That's my lunch.

339
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:35,879
In London, April's a spring month.

340
00:53:36,005 --> 00:53:39,007
Oh, yeah? What are you -
the weatherman?

341
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:41,801
For cryin' out loud.
Another stiff-assed Brit,

342
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:44,637
with your secret codes and passwords.

343
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:47,807
One of these days you guys
are gonna learn just to drop it.

344
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:50,560
Come on. My car's over there.

345
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,869
-After you.
-Thank you.

346
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,415
-Like you said, drop it.
-All right.

347
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:16,711
In London, April's a spring month.
In St Petersburg, we freeze our butts off.

348
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:19,714
-Close enough for government work?
-No.

349
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:23,927
-Show me the rose.
-Please, no.

350
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,554
All right, all right, all right.

351
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,653
-"Muffy"?
-Third wife.

352
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:45,490
-Jack Wade, CIA.
-James Bond, stiff-assed Brit.

353
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:47,659
-That's a nice move.
-Nice car.

354
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:51,788
Hasn't let me down yet. She's an ugly
little bitch, but she gets you there.

355
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:54,499
Hey, Bond. Do you do any gardening?

356
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:05,301
<i>St Petersburg express</i>
<i>has now arrived at Platform 3.</i>

357
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,518
Can you hand me that wrench, Jimmy?

358
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:17,814
-So what do you know about Janus?
-Zilch. Zipsky.

359
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:21,526
No one's ever seen him.
But the man's connected up the kazoo.

360
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:24,153
KGB, military. Screwdriver.

361
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:30,326
Rumour has it he lives on
one of those old Soviet missile trains.

362
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:34,539
That armoured stuff they used to
run around so we couldn't target 'em.

363
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:38,001
Wanna hand me that hammer, Jimbo?

364
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:40,545
No, the bigger one. The sledge.

365
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:44,966
Anyways, to tell the truth,
you don't find this guy. He finds you.

366
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,969
Hell, it's all Russian Mafia.

367
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:52,849
Best thing I can do is point you
in the direction of his competition.

368
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:59,605
-Who is the competition?
-An ex-KGB guy. Tough mother.

369
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,358
Limps on his right leg. Name's Zukovsky.

370
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:04,944
-Valentin Dimitreveych Zukovsky?
-Yeah.

371
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:07,864
-You know him?
-I gave him the limp.

372
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,849
Yes?

373
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:39,270
-Are these all you have?
-How many do you want?

374
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:43,274
24 for the American school,
1 1 for the Swedish.

375
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:48,738
IBM-compatible with 500 meg
hard drives, CD-ROM and 1 4.4 modems.

376
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:52,075
-You pay dollars?
-Of course.

377
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:54,327
If madam requires a demonstration...

378
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:59,415
Madam requires one demonstration
model and a quiet place to test it.

379
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,430
Natalya.

380
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:35,618
-Is everything satisfactory?
-Everything except the interruption.

381
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:50,049
<i>Let me get this straight, Jimmy.</i>

382
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:53,970
<i>You shot him in the Ieg,</i>
<i>you stoIe his car, you took his girI.</i>

383
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:57,140
<i>And now you want Zukovsky</i>
<i>to set you up with Janus?</i>

384
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,726
-Yes.
-Are you gonna appeal to his heart?

385
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,980
-No. His wallet.
-That might work.

386
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,440
OK. Showtime.

387
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:14,699
Valentin operates
out of building number 23.

388
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:16,909
Are you sure you wanna do this?

389
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:22,331
Last guy who dropped in uninvited went
home air freight -in very small boxes.

390
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:26,335
Make sure they send me home first class.

391
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:24,894
Natalya. It's me. It's Boris.
It's Boris. It's Boris. Hello.

392
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,402
Another morning shot to hell.

393
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:39,325
Free-market economy!
I swear it will be the end of me.

394
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:47,083
Walther PPK, 7.65mm.

395
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:52,380
Only three men I know use such a gun.
I believe I've killed two of them.

396
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:56,342
-Lucky me.
-I think not.

397
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:59,845
<i>Ooh-ahh</i>

398
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,682
<i>And if you Iove him</i>

399
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:03,933
<i>Love him</i>

400
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,894
<i>Oh, be so proud of him</i>

401
01:00:06,979 --> 01:00:08,145
<i>Of him</i>

402
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,940
<i>Cos after all</i>

403
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,526
<i>He's just a man</i>

404
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:18,739
<i>Stand by your man...</i>

405
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,953
James Bond.

406
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:27,915
Charming, sophisticated secret agent.

407
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:31,544
"Shaken, but not stirred."

408
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:36,507
I see you haven't lost your
delicate sense of humour, Valentin.

409
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:39,093
Or your need for an audience.

410
01:00:40,012 --> 01:00:43,639
-Who's strangling the cat?
-Strangling a cat?

411
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:45,933
<i>Stand by your man</i>

412
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:52,815
That is Irina, my mistress.

413
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:56,736
Very talented girl.

414
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,071
Irina. Take a hike.

415
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:09,123
So, Mr Bond, what is it that
brings you to my neighbourhood?

416
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:14,879
Still working for MI6, or
have you joined the 21 st century?

417
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,922
I hear the new M is a lady.

418
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:20,343
I want you to do me a favour.

419
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:25,681
He wants me to do him a favour.

420
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:32,772
My knee aches every single day.
Twice as bad when it is cold.

421
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:36,734
Have you any idea how long
the winter lasts in this country?

422
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:39,070
-Tell him, Dimitri.
-It depends...

423
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:40,821
Silence.

424
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:44,367
For an ex-KGB agent,
you surprise me, Valentin.

425
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:49,246
Surely you must have realised the skill
was not to hit your knee, but to

426
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:51,624
miss the rest of you.

427
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:57,380
-So why did you not kill me?
-Call it professional courtesy.

428
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:01,967
Then I should extend you
the same courtesy.

429
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:08,557
Kirov's funeral parlour,
four o'clock this afternoon.

430
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:11,894
200 pounds of C4 explosives
hidden in a casket.

431
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:15,439
Your man drives the hearse in,
the money's exchanged,

432
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:18,150
their man drives the hearse out.

433
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:20,945
Their man will be arrested
with the explosives.

434
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:24,949
Your man will make
a miraculous escape with the money.

435
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:27,159
Your money.

436
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:29,870
And what do I owe
for this accommodation?

437
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:33,416
I want you to set me up with Janus.

438
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:38,587
-What has he done to deserve you?
-Stole a helicopter.

439
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:41,257
-I have six.
-Three. None that fly.

440
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:45,428
-Who's counting?
-These aren't just criminals but traitors.

441
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:51,267
They used the chopper to steal a nuclear
weapon. Killed a lot of innocent Russians.

442
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:53,853
-What do you expect from a Cossack?
-Who?

443
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:58,607
This Janus -I never met the man,
but I know he's a Lienz Cossack.

444
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:02,153
The group that worked
for the Nazis, Second World War.

445
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:04,989
You know your history.
At the end of the war,

446
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:08,659
the Lienz Cossacks surrendered
to the British in Austria,

447
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:13,205
believing they would join them
and wage war against the communists.

448
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:16,667
But the British betrayed them,
sent them back to Stalin,

449
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,836
who promptly had them all shot.

450
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,380
Women, children, families.

451
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:25,968
Not exactly our finest hour.

452
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:30,014
Still, ruthless people.
They got what they deserved.

453
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:34,018
I want you to set me up with Janus.
Tell him I'm asking about the chopper.

454
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:38,481
-You meet me tonight at the Grand Hotel.
-And then you and I are even and

455
01:03:38,607 --> 01:03:41,734
-he owes me one.
-Precisely.

456
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:47,007
You don't need the gun, Commander.

457
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,177
That depends on
your definition of safe sex.

458
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:58,310
That's close enough.

459
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:00,938
Not for what I have in mind.

460
01:05:24,713 --> 01:05:27,590
You think you can hurt me?

461
01:05:46,735 --> 01:05:49,028
You think you can break me?

462
01:05:57,537 --> 01:05:59,955
Yes! Yes! Yes!

463
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:09,423
No, no, no.

464
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:11,967
No more foreplay.

465
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:14,720
Take me to Janus.

466
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:15,804
<i>Buliatch.</i>

467
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:32,655
-This is it?
-Yes.

468
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:38,494
Well, I must say, I've had a lovely evening.

469
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:42,498
-You?
-Once again, the pleasure was all yours.

470
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:46,960
-You'll understand if I don't call.
-I won't lose sleep over it.

471
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,382
Sweet dreams.

472
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:05,414
Hello, James.

473
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:31,440
-Alec?
-Back from the dead.

474
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:34,777
No longer just an anonymous star
on the Memorial Wall at MI6.

475
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:40,741
What's the matter, James?
No glib remark? No pithy comeback?

476
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:44,620
Why?

477
01:08:45,413 --> 01:08:48,832
Hilarious question. Particularly from you.

478
01:08:49,501 --> 01:08:55,631
Did you ever ask why we toppled
all those dictators and regimes,

479
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:59,176
only to come home - "Well done.
Good job, but sorry, old boy."

480
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:02,095
"Everything you risked
your life for has changed."

481
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:06,308
-It was the job we were chosen for.
-Of course you'd say that.

482
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:12,314
James Bond, Her Majesty's loyal terrier,
defender of the so-called faith.

483
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,775
Please, James, put it away.

484
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:19,780
It's insulting to think
I haven't anticipated your every move.

485
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:22,908
Yes.

486
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:30,457
-I trusted you, Alec.
-Trust. What a quaint idea.

487
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:35,587
How did the MI6 screening miss
that your parents were Lienz Cossacks?

488
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:39,341
Once again, your faith
is misplaced. They knew.

489
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:41,802
We're both orphans, James.

490
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:46,139
But where your parents had the luxury
of dying in a climbing accident,

491
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:50,894
mine survived the British betrayal
and Stalin's execution squads.

492
01:09:50,979 --> 01:09:56,400
But my father couldn't let himself
or my mother live with the shame of it.

493
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:59,194
MI6 figured I was too young to remember.

494
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:02,489
And in one of life's little ironies,

495
01:10:02,574 --> 01:10:05,868
the son went to work for
the government whose betrayal

496
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:09,454
caused the father to kill
himself and his wife.

497
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:15,127
Hence Janus, the two-faced
Roman god, come to life.

498
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:18,171
It wasn't God who gave me this face.

499
01:10:18,256 --> 01:10:21,925
It was you, setting the timers
for three minutes instead of six.

500
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:27,264
-Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?
-No. You're supposed to die for me.

501
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:32,394
By the way,

502
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:37,649
I did think of asking you to join
my little scheme, but somehow I knew

503
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:41,612
007's loyalty was always to the mission,

504
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:43,780
never to his friend.

505
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,701
Closing time, James. Last call.

506
01:11:03,551 --> 01:11:04,760
For England, James.

507
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:08,096
Wake up. Mister.

508
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:13,185
Wake up, please. Wake up.

509
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,145
I'm here. I'm here.

510
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:18,273
Hurry. Hurry up. Come on.

511
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:21,151
Pull yourself together or we're gonna die.

512
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:28,700
-Do something. Get us out of here.
-I'm a little tied up.

513
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:30,160
Never mind.

514
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,492
The things we do
for frequent-flier mileage.

515
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:55,996
Here. Let me help you.

516
01:12:56,164 --> 01:12:58,790
That's it. Mind your head.

517
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,592
Let me go.

518
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:54,930
Who are you?

519
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:59,768
-Listen. I'm on your side.
-I don't know anything.

520
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,728
-I don't believe you.
-I don't care.

521
01:14:01,813 --> 01:14:04,106
Look, they might be back any minute.

522
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:08,026
Are you with me, or your countrymen
who killed everyone at Severnaya?

523
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:10,904
I've never been to Severnaya.

524
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:14,324
Your watch has. Frozen
by the GoldenEye blast.

525
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:20,455
And I'm willing to bet you're the one
who climbed up the dish to get out.

526
01:14:20,915 --> 01:14:23,333
-Who are you?
-I work for the British government.

527
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:25,919
The more you tell me,
the more I can help you.

528
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:30,173
-But I don't know anything.
-Then start with what you do know.

529
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:42,644
My name is Natalya Simonova.

530
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:46,898
I was a systems programmer
at Severnaya facility until...

531
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:49,067
Go on.

532
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:53,613
-...until they killed everyone.
-Who? Alec Trevelyan?

533
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:58,201
-No. I don't know who that is.
-Who's the insider? Who's the traitor?

534
01:14:58,286 --> 01:15:00,579
Boris. Boris Grishenko.

535
01:15:00,872 --> 01:15:04,624
-KGB or military?
-Computer programmer.

536
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:07,961
-There was no one else?
-No.

537
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:11,715
They're going to kill me, aren't they?

538
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:14,926
Trust me.

539
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:20,932
Trust you? I don't even know your name.

540
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:26,021
Good morning, Mr Bond. Sit.

541
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:35,780
I am Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin.

542
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:39,326
So, by what means shall we
execute you, Commander Bond?

543
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:41,494
What, no small talk?

544
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:43,705
No chitchat?

545
01:15:43,915 --> 01:15:48,418
That's the trouble. No one has time to do
a really sinister interrogation any more.

546
01:15:48,628 --> 01:15:52,422
-It's a lost art.
-Your sense of humour doesn't slay me.

547
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:55,091
-Where is the GoldenEye?
-I assumed you had it.

548
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:58,803
I have an English spy,
a programmer and a helicopter...

549
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:02,307
-That's how your traitor wants it to look.
-Who attacked Severnaya?

550
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:06,353
-Who had the codes?
-The penalty for terrorism is still death.

551
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:10,607
-And for treason?
-Stop it, both of you. Stop it.

552
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:13,193
You're like boys with toys.

553
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:21,409
It was Ourumov.
General Ourumov set off the weapon.

554
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:23,745
I saw him do it.

555
01:16:26,457 --> 01:16:29,876
-Are you certain it was Ourumov?
-Yes.

556
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:34,089
He killed everyone,
then stole the GoldenEye.

557
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:35,924
And why would he do that?

558
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,844
There is another satellite.

559
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:45,183
Another GoldenEye.

560
01:16:45,977 --> 01:16:48,812
Thank you, Miss Simonova.

561
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:52,607
What did you say about
the lost art of interrogation, Mr Bond?

562
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:58,196
Defence Minister, I must protest.
This is my investigation.

563
01:16:58,281 --> 01:17:01,449
-You are out of order.
-Molcheetye. Molcheech.

564
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:05,537
From what I am hearing,
it is you who is out of order.

565
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,998
I've seen this gun
in the hand of our enemy.

566
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:12,377
-Put it down, General.
-Do you even know who the enemy is?

567
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,129
-Do you?
-Guard.

568
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:23,430
Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin,

569
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:28,560
murdered by British agent James Bond,

570
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:34,691
himself shot while trying to escape.

571
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:36,192
Guards.

572
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:48,830
Come on.

573
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:30,580
They're in the archive.

574
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:37,045
Down.

575
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:31,349
Spread out. Cover the other side.

576
01:19:31,434 --> 01:19:33,518
Trust me.

577
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:12,098
Go now.

578
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:42,962
Faster.

579
01:21:03,817 --> 01:21:05,318
Damn it.

580
01:21:12,243 --> 01:21:14,577
Down the alley.

581
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:16,097
Use the bumper. That's what it's for.

582
01:22:28,986 --> 01:22:30,403
<i>Nazad.</i>

583
01:23:52,695 --> 01:23:54,362
What was that?

584
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,067
Go left.

585
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:15,443
Get out.

586
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:13,209
Either you've brought me the perfect gift,
or you've made me a very unhappy man.

587
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:16,295
Mishkin got to them before I could.

588
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,882
Bond is alive?

589
01:26:19,967 --> 01:26:23,845
-He escaped.
-Good for Bond.

590
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:26,514
Bad for you.

591
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:31,102
Take a seat, my dear.

592
01:26:47,578 --> 01:26:50,788
You know, James and I
shared everything.

593
01:26:52,499 --> 01:26:54,959
Absolutely everything.

594
01:27:00,007 --> 01:27:01,257
To the victor go the spoils.

595
01:27:11,184 --> 01:27:12,810
You'll like it where we're going.

596
01:27:19,568 --> 01:27:21,652
You may even learn to like me.

597
01:27:29,453 --> 01:27:31,412
<i>Svinya.</i>

598
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:33,372
Stay with her.

599
01:27:39,463 --> 01:27:42,381
Bond. Only Bond.

600
01:27:42,716 --> 01:27:45,426
He's going to derail us.

601
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:48,471
-Full speed.
<i>-Shto?</i>

602
01:27:48,555 --> 01:27:50,222
Full speed. Ram him.

603
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:53,100
Bye-bye.

604
01:28:55,789 --> 01:28:58,666
Why can't you just
be a good boy and die?

605
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,376
You first.

606
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,545
You second.

607
01:29:03,463 --> 01:29:05,131
Up.

608
01:29:08,552 --> 01:29:12,096
Situation analysis: hopeless.

609
01:29:13,223 --> 01:29:16,308
You have no backup, no escape route.

610
01:29:16,393 --> 01:29:19,311
And I have the only bargaining chip.

611
01:29:19,396 --> 01:29:23,899
-Where is she?
-Ah, yes. Your fatal weakness.

612
01:29:25,527 --> 01:29:28,070
Ourumov, bring her in.

613
01:29:29,865 --> 01:29:31,741
Lovely girl.

614
01:29:31,825 --> 01:29:35,453
Tastes like...like strawberries.

615
01:29:35,746 --> 01:29:38,789
-I wouldn't know.
-I would.

616
01:29:45,881 --> 01:29:48,049
So, back where we started, James.

617
01:29:49,259 --> 01:29:51,844
Your friend, or the mission?

618
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:54,555
Drop the gun. I'll let her live.

619
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:02,605
Ourumov, what has
this Cossack promised you?

620
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:07,276
You knew, didn't you?
He's a Lienz Cossack.

621
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:12,156
-It's in the past.
-He'll betray you. Just like everyone else.

622
01:30:12,491 --> 01:30:15,367
-Is this true?
-What's true is that in 48 hours

623
01:30:15,452 --> 01:30:18,579
you and I will have more money than God,

624
01:30:18,872 --> 01:30:22,208
and Mr Bond here will have
a small memorial service

625
01:30:22,501 --> 01:30:27,838
with only Moneypenny and a few
tearful restaurateurs in attendance.

626
01:30:27,923 --> 01:30:31,050
So, what's the choice, James?

627
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:35,262
Two targets, time enough for one shot.

628
01:30:35,597 --> 01:30:37,556
The girl, or the mission?

629
01:30:38,058 --> 01:30:40,851
Kill her. She means nothing to me.

630
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:46,524
See you in hell, James.

631
01:30:57,035 --> 01:31:01,664
-One-inch armour plating.
-I'm fine, thank you very much!

632
01:31:06,336 --> 01:31:08,629
Boris. Yes.

633
01:31:09,256 --> 01:31:12,466
-What are you doing?
-Boris is on-line backing up his files.

634
01:31:12,551 --> 01:31:16,887
If I can spike him, I might be able
to find out where they're going.

635
01:31:18,682 --> 01:31:22,476
-Don't stand there. Get us out of here.
-Yes, sir.

636
01:31:40,662 --> 01:31:42,788
<i>Good luck with the floor, James.</i>

637
01:31:42,873 --> 01:31:46,625
<i>l set the timers for six minutes -</i>
<i>the same six minutes you gave me.</i>

638
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:50,129
It was the least I could do for a friend.

639
01:31:52,382 --> 01:31:55,634
-What does that mean?
-We've got three minutes.

640
01:32:29,211 --> 01:32:31,629
-What else do you call your bottom?
-What?

641
01:32:31,713 --> 01:32:35,799
Boris' password. He plays word games.
"What I sit on but don't take with me."

642
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:38,844
-Chair.
-Like I said...

643
01:32:43,183 --> 01:32:44,266
30 seconds.

644
01:32:44,351 --> 01:32:48,020
He's not in Russia,
Germany, Paris, London, Madrid...

645
01:32:48,104 --> 01:32:51,232
-25 seconds.
-New York, Toronto, Chicago,

646
01:32:51,316 --> 01:32:53,275
-San Francisco...
-20 seconds.

647
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,694
Mexico City, Rio, Miami...

648
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:05,371
-Come on.
-Wait. He's in Cuba. Havana -no.

649
01:33:06,623 --> 01:33:07,706
Now.

650
01:33:27,644 --> 01:33:30,980
Do you destroy
every vehicle you get into?

651
01:33:31,064 --> 01:33:33,774
Standard operating procedure.

652
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:37,444
Boys with toys.

653
01:33:40,073 --> 01:33:44,994
Maybe I should take care of
the transportation for our trip to Cuba.

654
01:33:45,287 --> 01:33:46,620
Our trip?

655
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:49,999
Do you know how to disarm the weapon?

656
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:56,672
I suppose that depends on what kind of
weapon you're talking about disarming.

657
01:33:57,424 --> 01:34:03,929
So, tell me. Are there any other
standard operating procedures

658
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:07,683
I should be aware of, Commander?

659
01:34:11,688 --> 01:34:13,647
Thousands.

660
01:34:13,732 --> 01:34:16,275
But I only pay them

661
01:34:16,818 --> 01:34:18,902
lip service.

662
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:45,471
My whole life I dreamed
about coming to the Caribbean.

663
01:34:45,555 --> 01:34:47,806
It's so beautiful.

664
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:50,142
Not another human being in sight.

665
01:35:03,239 --> 01:35:05,949
What is it with you and moving vehicles?

666
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:35,938
Yo, Jimbo. Brought a little gift
from old whatshisname? T? Z?

667
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:37,731
-Q.
-Yeah.

668
01:35:37,816 --> 01:35:41,485
-What are you doing here, Wade?
-Banyan trees.

669
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:45,280
I am not here. The CIA has
no knowledge, no involvement.

670
01:35:45,365 --> 01:35:49,368
Nothing to do with your insertion
into Cuba, if you catch my drift.

671
01:35:49,452 --> 01:35:50,744
Yes, I do.

672
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:53,372
Borrowed the plane
from a friend in the DEA.

673
01:35:53,915 --> 01:35:55,999
The Coast Guard and the FAA
are in the loop.

674
01:35:56,084 --> 01:35:58,794
You're cleared on our radar
for 0600 hours.

675
01:35:59,129 --> 01:36:01,296
Here's the latest sat-int from Langley.

676
01:36:01,381 --> 01:36:05,175
-Stay below 600 feet.
-500 feet.

677
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:07,845
-Who's that?
-Natalya Simonova.

678
01:36:07,929 --> 01:36:11,014
-Sim-yo-nova.
-Russian minister of transportation.

679
01:36:14,227 --> 01:36:16,603
Did you check her out?

680
01:36:16,938 --> 01:36:20,524
-Head to toe.
-Right...

681
01:36:21,317 --> 01:36:25,487
So, you're lookin' for a dish the size
of a football field, huh? Doesn't exist.

682
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:29,158
-Light a cigar in Cuba and we see it.
-I know it's there.

683
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:34,163
It's a duplicate of Severnaya, like
your secret transmitters in New Zealand.

684
01:36:34,497 --> 01:36:37,082
I've never been there.
How does she know about that?

685
01:36:37,167 --> 01:36:41,962
-What if I need backup?
-Get on the radio. I'll send in the marines.

686
01:36:42,464 --> 01:36:44,923
Anyway, hang a left
at the end of the runway.

687
01:36:45,008 --> 01:36:48,969
-Cuba's 80 miles on your right.
-Yo, Wade.

688
01:36:51,890 --> 01:36:55,267
Just one thing. Don't push
any of the buttons on that car.

689
01:36:55,351 --> 01:36:58,812
-I'm just gonna bomb around in it.
-Exactly.

690
01:36:59,481 --> 01:37:02,274
Yo, James. I got faith, but be careful.

691
01:37:02,358 --> 01:37:05,110
He knows you're comin'.

692
01:38:08,216 --> 01:38:10,801
He was your friend -Trevelyan.

693
01:38:12,804 --> 01:38:15,847
And now he's your enemy
and you will kill him.

694
01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:20,894
It is that simple?

695
01:38:20,979 --> 01:38:23,897
In a word, yes.

696
01:38:24,357 --> 01:38:26,525
-Unless he kills you first.
-Natalya...

697
01:38:26,609 --> 01:38:31,822
You think I'm impressed? With your guns,
your killing, your death. For what?

698
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:34,408
So you can be a hero?

699
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:37,953
-All the heroes I know are dead.
-Natalya...

700
01:38:38,037 --> 01:38:41,206
How can you act like this?
How can you be so cold?

701
01:38:43,334 --> 01:38:46,044
It's what keeps me alive.

702
01:38:47,088 --> 01:38:50,257
No. It's what keeps you alone.

703
01:39:29,714 --> 01:39:31,798
James...

704
01:39:33,259 --> 01:39:35,344
Yes?

705
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:44,811
On the train,

706
01:39:44,896 --> 01:39:49,441
when you told him to kill me
and that I meant nothing to you,

707
01:39:49,525 --> 01:39:51,902
did you mean it?

708
01:39:53,571 --> 01:39:55,447
Yes.

709
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:59,576
Basic rule: always call their bluff.

710
01:40:04,248 --> 01:40:05,916
No.

711
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:43,245
Turn ten degrees south, bearing 1 -8-4.

712
01:40:43,329 --> 01:40:45,205
Yes, sir.

713
01:41:09,647 --> 01:41:13,191
Nothing. There is nothing here.

714
01:41:14,026 --> 01:41:16,111
Let's make another pass.

715
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:31,334
Maybe Wade was right. There is no dish.

716
01:42:30,019 --> 01:42:31,686
Natalya.

717
01:43:31,956 --> 01:43:37,168
This time, Mr Bond,
the pleasure will be all mine.

718
01:43:56,355 --> 01:43:57,772
You wait for your turn.

719
01:44:32,224 --> 01:44:34,017
She always did enjoy a good squeeze.

720
01:44:45,655 --> 01:44:48,823
-Is the satellite in range?
-Six minutes.

721
01:44:48,908 --> 01:44:52,160
-Prepare the dish.
-No. It's too early.

722
01:44:52,411 --> 01:44:55,538
-I am not ready.
-Do it.

723
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:27,237
No wonder we couldn't see it.

724
01:45:38,541 --> 01:45:40,625
Come on.

725
01:45:55,766 --> 01:45:58,685
The world's greatest cash card.

726
01:45:59,854 --> 01:46:02,814
It had better not be rejected.

727
01:47:06,337 --> 01:47:09,464
-Mischa is on-line.
-Sir.

728
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:16,846
Kill him.

729
01:47:16,931 --> 01:47:19,015
The man just won't take a hint.

730
01:47:20,643 --> 01:47:24,646
-Target coordinates?
-The target is London.

731
01:47:37,493 --> 01:47:40,120
He's getting ready to signal the satellite.

732
01:47:40,538 --> 01:47:43,248
-How do you stop it?
-The transmitter above the antenna.

733
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:16,990
Antenna in position.

734
01:48:20,703 --> 01:48:21,953
On my count.

735
01:48:22,955 --> 01:48:26,166
Three, two, one.

736
01:48:55,362 --> 01:48:57,447
God save the Queen.

737
01:49:16,592 --> 01:49:19,719
-The mainframe computer.
-Don't move.

738
01:50:46,473 --> 01:50:49,475
James. What an unpleasant surprise.

739
01:50:49,977 --> 01:50:53,104
-We aim to please.
-Where's the girl?

740
01:50:53,814 --> 01:50:55,815
Find her.

741
01:51:02,781 --> 01:51:04,824
So, how is old Q?

742
01:51:05,576 --> 01:51:07,744
Up to his usual tricks?

743
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:10,663
The watch.

744
01:51:15,586 --> 01:51:19,422
A new model. Still press here, do I?

745
01:51:36,273 --> 01:51:37,774
Interesting setup, Alec.

746
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:41,736
You break into the Bank of England
via computer,

747
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:44,364
then transfer the money electronically

748
01:51:44,448 --> 01:51:47,200
just seconds before
you set off the GoldenEye,

749
01:51:47,868 --> 01:51:51,037
which erases any record
of the transactions.

750
01:51:51,663 --> 01:51:54,415
-Ingenious.
-Thank you, James.

751
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:57,627
But it still boils down to petty theft.

752
01:51:58,545 --> 01:52:02,715
In the end, you're just a bank robber.
Nothing more than a common thief.

753
01:52:13,227 --> 01:52:15,686
You always did have
a small mind, James.

754
01:52:16,397 --> 01:52:21,234
It's not just erasing bank records. It's
everything on every computer in London.

755
01:52:21,527 --> 01:52:26,239
Tax records, the stock market,
credit ratings, land registries,

756
01:52:26,490 --> 01:52:28,449
criminal records.

757
01:52:28,784 --> 01:52:33,121
In 1 6 minutes and 43... No, 42 seconds,

758
01:52:33,539 --> 01:52:35,873
the United Kingdom
will re-enter the Stone Age.

759
01:52:35,958 --> 01:52:37,917
A worldwide financial meltdown.

760
01:52:39,044 --> 01:52:43,339
And all so mad little Alec can settle
a score with the world 50 years on.

761
01:52:43,424 --> 01:52:47,718
Please, James. Spare me the Freud.
I might as well ask you

762
01:52:47,803 --> 01:52:52,014
if all the vodka martinis ever silence
the screams of all the men you've killed.

763
01:52:55,436 --> 01:52:58,604
Or if you find forgiveness
in the arms of all those willing women

764
01:52:59,565 --> 01:53:01,816
for all the dead ones
you failed to protect.

765
01:53:04,111 --> 01:53:07,613
England is about to learn
the cost of betrayal,

766
01:53:07,739 --> 01:53:10,450
inflation-adjusted for 1 945.

767
01:53:13,245 --> 01:53:15,788
-Welcome to the party, my dear.
-Natalya.

768
01:53:50,616 --> 01:53:54,035
Don't ever do that again.

769
01:53:54,495 --> 01:53:57,788
This is not one of your games, Boris.
Real people will die.

770
01:53:57,873 --> 01:53:59,749
You pathetic little worm.

771
01:54:01,627 --> 01:54:04,128
She was in the mainframe.
Check the computer.

772
01:54:04,213 --> 01:54:08,007
She's a moron.
A second-level programmer.

773
01:54:08,842 --> 01:54:11,719
She works on the guidance system.

774
01:54:11,845 --> 01:54:15,848
She doesn't even have access
to the firing codes.

775
01:54:20,187 --> 01:54:21,604
Retro-rockets firing.

776
01:54:39,706 --> 01:54:45,545
-What the hell's happening?
-We will have re-entry in 1 2 minutes.

777
01:54:47,005 --> 01:54:49,590
It will burn up
somewhere over the Atlantic.

778
01:54:49,716 --> 01:54:53,678
-Deal with it.
-She changed the access codes.

779
01:54:55,264 --> 01:54:57,765
Then she can fix it.

780
01:55:00,561 --> 01:55:04,230
Go ahead. Shoot him.
He means nothing to me.

781
01:55:05,524 --> 01:55:08,568
I can do it. I can break her codes.

782
01:55:08,694 --> 01:55:11,195
Then get on with it.

783
01:55:38,974 --> 01:55:41,017
Tell him. Now.

784
01:55:41,768 --> 01:55:45,187
Give me the codes, Natalya.
Give them to me.

785
01:56:01,330 --> 01:56:03,998
-Can Boris break your codes?
-Possibly.

786
01:56:04,124 --> 01:56:06,500
Possibly?

787
01:56:06,627 --> 01:56:09,003
We have to destroy the transmitter.

788
01:56:09,129 --> 01:56:12,840
By the way, I'm fine,
thank you very much!

789
01:56:40,994 --> 01:56:42,495
Do you know how to use one of these?

790
01:56:45,999 --> 01:56:47,416
Yes.

791
01:56:47,501 --> 01:56:49,627
Good. Stay out of sight.

792
01:57:04,518 --> 01:57:06,435
-How long?
-Two minutes.

793
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:08,104
-One minute.
-Guard.

794
01:57:08,188 --> 01:57:12,817
-I'm fixing it.
-If he moves, kill him.

795
01:58:34,900 --> 01:58:37,610
Yes. I am invincible.

796
02:00:48,575 --> 02:00:51,660
You know, James?

797
02:00:51,745 --> 02:00:53,370
I was always better.

798
02:01:10,805 --> 02:01:12,014
Alpha One to Gunship.

799
02:01:13,058 --> 02:01:15,517
<i>Alpha One to Gunship.</i>

800
02:02:16,246 --> 02:02:18,122
Speak to me.

801
02:02:53,199 --> 02:02:55,075
For England, James?

802
02:02:55,952 --> 02:02:57,411
No.

803
02:02:58,288 --> 02:02:59,747
For me.

804
02:04:19,035 --> 02:04:21,537
Yes. I am invincible.

805
02:04:46,312 --> 02:04:49,857
James. James. Are you all right?

806
02:04:53,736 --> 02:04:56,113
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.

807
02:05:06,207 --> 02:05:08,917
Suppose someone is watching?

808
02:05:09,961 --> 02:05:13,589
There's no one within 25 miles,
believe me.

809
02:05:13,673 --> 02:05:16,133
Yo, Jimbo.

810
02:05:24,601 --> 02:05:28,979
Is this supposed to be your idea
of "coming through in a clinch"?

811
02:05:30,607 --> 02:05:59,941
It's tobacco plants.

812
02:05:33,026 --> 02:05:34,985
I said I'd be here, huh?

813
02:05:35,069 --> 02:05:37,362
Yo. Marines.

814
02:05:47,415 --> 02:05:52,961
Maybe you two'd like to finish debriefing
each other at Guantanamo?

815
02:05:53,713 --> 02:05:55,923
-Ready?
-I'm not going on a helicopter with you.

816
02:05:56,049 --> 02:05:59,343
No plane, no train, nothing that moves.

817
02:05:59,427 --> 02:06:02,888
Darling, what could
possibly go wrong, hey?

818
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:55,307

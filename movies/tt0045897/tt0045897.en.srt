2
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,324
Who's there?

3
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,038
Keller.

4
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,999
Why are you here this time of night?

5
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,752
I... I wanted to pray.

6
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,963
Is something wrong?

7
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,632
I...

8
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,718
Can I help you in any way?

9
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,473
- Can I be of any help?
- No one can help me.

10
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,352
I have abused your kindness.

11
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,187
How?

12
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:36,359
You gave my wife and me
a home, a job, even friendship.

13
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,362
I felt you would let me be your friend.

14
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:44,700
So wonderful a thing for a refugee,
a German, a man without a home.

15
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,578
You will hate me now.

16
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,705
I don't hate anyone, Keller.

17
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,584
You will, after what you have done for me.

18
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,962
You trusted me.

19
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,090
You saw that my wife and I
were not common servants.

20
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:04,762
It was you who found more pleasant tasks
for us, working here in the rectory.

21
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:09,225
It was my wife, working so hard...

22
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,019
It breaks my heart.

23
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,564
What is the matter?

24
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,443
I must confess to you.

25
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,904
I must tell someone.

26
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:28,160
I want to make a confession.

27
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:55,521
I confess to Almighty God
and to you, Father, that I have sinned.

28
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,606
When was your last confession?

29
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,400
I can't remember.

30
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,444
Can you remember approximately?

31
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,948
I have killed Mr. Villette.

32
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,588
Go on.

33
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,923
Villette, the lawyer.

34
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,176
I went to his house tonight.

35
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,428
I went to steal his money.

36
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,014
I wore a cassock to avoid attention.

37
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,515
He surprised me.

38
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,101
He was going to call the police.

39
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:38,564
He was going to call the police
and I tried to stop him.

40
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,525
I didn't mean to kill him.

41
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,070
Alma, I'm not a murderer.

42
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,530
It was an accident.

43
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,991
It was the money.

44
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:53,079
How could I watch you work so hard?

45
00:06:54,164 --> 00:07:00,503
I lie awake night after night
and I think, "All we need is $2,000."

46
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,591
Alma, with $2,000,
we can start a new life.

47
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,052
Villette was rich.

48
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,098
But now I cannot keep it.

49
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:16,310
That's what Father Logan told me.
I must give it back.

50
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,062
I promised him.

51
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,147
It's so hard, Alma.

52
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,233
It's so dangerous.

53
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,110
They will catch me.

54
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,986
They will hang me.

55
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,696
I cannot.

56
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,074
I cannot.

57
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:35,246
Father Logan will go to them.
He will tell them.

58
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,465
He will tell them?

59
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:52,805
He cannot tell them
what he heard in confession.

60
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:55,099
The police will come.

61
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,393
Why, Alma?

62
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,604
Why should they come here?

63
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,399
They know nothing.

64
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,862
I have told them nothing, have I?

65
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:12,283
Alma, no one knows.

66
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:13,909
Father Logan.

67
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,413
He cannot tell them
what he heard in the confessional.

68
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,081
Can't you understand that?

69
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,544
Otto.

70
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,683
What is it, Alma?

71
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,810
You're going to the police?

72
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,812
What is today, Alma?

73
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,940
Isn't it the day when I attend
to Mr. Villette's garden?

74
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,775
But he's dead.

75
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:51,530
I always work in Mr. Villette's garden
on Wednesdays.

76
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,909
Today is Wednesday, Alma.

77
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,686
- Good morning, Father Logan.
- Good morning, Father.

78
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,106
Tell me, will it take you and Keller
much longer

79
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,233
to finish the painting in this room?

80
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,278
I don't know.

81
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:16,532
I only ask because the smell
makes one quite ill, really.

82
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,202
You know, I read some advertisement
about paints

83
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,581
and, of course, one should not judge
on so little evidence, but I...

84
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:25,958
After you, Father.

85
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:31,255
One finds it difficult to believe
that there are paints with no smell.

86
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:38,053
Do you know of any paints
that do not smell, Father Michael?

87
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,847
Do I know...

88
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,015
Oh, uh...

89
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,850
No, I don't.

90
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,270
Well, don't think of it.
It doesn't matter.

91
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,612
How fortunate we are
to have Keller with us.

92
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,240
The man is clever about everything.

93
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,160
Before he came six months ago,
don't you remember

94
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:04,830
how all the drains wouldn't work
and the windows would not open?

95
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,417
One can learn a great deal from him.

96
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,044
Aha.

97
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:14,048
Father Benoit and his bicycle
are in time for breakfast.

98
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,300
Good morning, Father Millars.
Good morning, Father Michael.

99
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,177
- Good morning.
- Morning.

100
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:22,723
Seriously, must you keep your bicycle
in the hall, Father Benoit?

101
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:29,104
It doesn't always fall,
and I don't seem to know where else.

102
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,607
It's lucky he doesn't have a horse.

103
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:34,777
Father, would you pass me
the butter, please?

104
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:38,947
Mrs. Keller, would you ask
your husband to look at my front tire?

105
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,783
It's flat. Could you, please?

106
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,368
My husband?

107
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,703
But it is Wednesday.

108
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,789
He's not here.

109
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,457
Thank you, no.

110
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,461
On Wednesdays,
he attends to Mr. Villette's garden.

111
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:53,587
Oh.

112
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,384
Then will you tell him
when he comes back, please?

113
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:03,055
Yes, Father, I'll tell him
when he comes back.

114
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:07,476
Now, now, Father Benoit,
you should learn how to patch a tire.

115
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:11,063
One should be able
to take care of one's possessions.

116
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,149
One has a face, one would shave it.

117
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,111
- One has a...
- Excuse me, please.

118
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,117
Good morning, Father.
Monsieur Villette's been murdered.

119
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,495
Good morning.

120
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,091
- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning.

121
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,093
- I had an appointment here.
- Appointment?

122
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,887
With Villette? Well, he's dead.

123
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,222
Yes, I know. Is there anything I can do?

124
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,059
Well, perhaps Mr. Larrue
would like to see you. Come in, Father.

125
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,816
Mr. Larrue, sir. Father here says
he had an appointment with Villette.

126
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,067
I'll be with you in a moment.

127
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,903
Hello, Father.

128
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,907
- I believe I've met you before, haven't I?
- Yes, I'm from St. Marie.

129
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,993
- Yes. And how is Father Millars?
- Father Millars is fine.

130
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,454
Good. You had an appointment
with Villette?

131
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,581
- Yes.
- Anything special?

132
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:55,250
- No. There was...
- You've, of course, heard what's happened.

133
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,920
Father, Keller works at the rectory,
doesn't he?

134
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,464
Yes. He and his wife work there.

135
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:04,718
The poor devil is terrified
at the moment, Father.

136
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,179
Forgive me, but I have
forgotten your name.

137
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,264
- Logan.
- Yes. Father Logan.

138
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,934
You don't mind if we call on you
later today, maybe tomorrow?

139
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:16,522
Perhaps we'd like to know what your
appointment with Villette was all about.

140
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,482
Au revoir. Murphy, get Keller.

141
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,526
He's the man who found the body.

142
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,821
- Mr. Larrue.
- Yeah.

143
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:26,281
No fingerprints.

144
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,783
All right.

145
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,161
This was on his desk.
The keys were in his pocket.

146
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:34,248
$500.
It does not look like robbery, sir.

147
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,333
They usually take the lot.

148
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,878
You work at the rectory
at St. Marie's, eh?

149
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,505
- Yes.
- Good.

150
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,132
Now, how did you find the body?

151
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,469
On Wednesdays,
I work in Mr. Villette's garden.

152
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,847
This morning, I arrived as usual at 8:30.

153
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,182
I came inside...

154
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,394
- You have a key?
- No. The door was open.

155
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,980
- That frightened me.
- An open door?

156
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,108
- Why should that frighten you?
- The door was always locked.

157
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,611
I went in, and there he was.

158
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,656
I could see that he was dead.

159
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,533
I wanted to run.

160
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:10,784
Run?

161
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:16,123
There I was, a man without a country,
alone, discovering a murder.

162
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,127
I thought of the police.
I'm always afraid of the police.

163
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,337
That's a German fear, this fear.

164
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,840
There's nothing to be afraid of.

165
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,633
Uh, step outside for a moment.

166
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,719
Yes. Thank you, sir.

167
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:39,938
- Villette's been murdered.
- He's dead? I can't believe it.

168
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,065
We're free.

169
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,638
- Bonjour, madame.
- Bonjour.

170
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,849
Good morning, Sergeant.
Is my husband in the chamber?

171
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,769
Yes, madame.
Mr. Grandfort is speaking now.

172
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,562
A very stormy debate.

173
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,898
That, I believe,
is the understatement of the year.

174
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,692
The honorable member
has used every known clichי,

175
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,737
except perhaps,
"Curb your dog, keep your city clean."

176
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,365
Equal salary
for female schoolteachers

177
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,825
would bring disaster to our whole economy.

178
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,037
Except to the economy
of female schoolteachers.

179
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,622
Mr. Speaker!

180
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,916
At this point
of the discussion, gentlemen,

181
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,628
I adjourn the House
until this afternoon at 3:00.

182
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:57,683
Ruth, my dear, what a charming surprise.

183
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,603
- Pierre, take me to lunch.
- Of course.

184
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,272
You're feeling better, then?
This morning, you seemed rather depressed.

185
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,360
- Was I?
- Yes, and not only this morning.

186
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,196
- I don't seem depressed now, do I?
- No.

187
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,413
The tire wasn't flat after all.

188
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,675
Of course, you and Keller
know what you are doing.

189
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:35,220
Personally, I would have preferred
an old-fashioned white.

190
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,972
- That's what it is, Father.
- Is it?

191
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,640
At least it's supposed to be.

192
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,768
- Mr. Keller, good morning.
- Good morning, Father.

193
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,480
You're back early, aren't you?
Is Mr. Villette's garden flourishing?

194
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:49,025
- Mr. Villette is dead, Father.
- Dead?

195
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,361
He was murdered, Father.

196
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:55,532
What? Did you hear that, Father Logan?
How dreadful.

197
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,784
I discovered the body.

198
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,745
I called the police.

199
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,499
Then they came and asked me
a lot of questions.

200
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,461
A lot of people were outside the house.

201
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:11,256
Then the inspector told me I could leave.

202
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,343
What a terrible thing.

203
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,679
A very terrible thing.

204
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:25,353
Father, why did you come
to Villette's house this morning?

205
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,149
Father, I must speak to you.

206
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,948
I know what you must think of me,
but I can't give myself up. I can't.

207
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,409
They would hang me.

208
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,205
Hasn't God forgiven me, thanks to you?

209
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,499
But the police never would.

210
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,251
I don't know what you're talking about.

211
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,296
But it was I who confessed to you.
It was my confession.

212
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,341
I want you to speak to me about it.

213
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,676
You must tell me what to do.

214
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,845
I can't give myself up.

215
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,765
You must tell me some other way.

216
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,768
There... There is nothing I can add
to what I've already said.

217
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,230
Aren't you human?

218
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,732
Haven't you ever been afraid?

219
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,859
You are so good.

220
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,654
It's easy for you to be good.

221
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,573
Have you no pity for me?

222
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:19,991
Otto.

223
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,827
Oh, Alma.

224
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:25,872
Otto, Father Benoit asked earlier

225
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:29,501
would you please
mend the tire on his bicycle?

226
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,755
But the tire wasn't flat after all, Alma.

227
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:40,011
I don't see why you're so
damn solemn about this case, Larrue.

228
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,890
Anyway, why do you come
and worry me after lunch?

229
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,935
I've always had the greatest
admiration for you, Inspector.

230
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:50,939
You have, in the past, been faced
with tremendously difficult cases,

231
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:54,442
all of which you have solved
with remarkable skill.

232
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,779
And now, here you have a case
in which there are no clues,

233
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,575
no fingerprints, no motives, no suspects.

234
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:04,661
Ought to be very simple for you.

235
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,330
Shall I bring the girls in, sir?

236
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,124
- Girls?
- Yes.

237
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,836
Just a possibility.
It may be something to go on.

238
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:15,589
Oh.

239
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:16,965
Sit down.

240
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,928
Uh, sorry I had to
drag you away from school.

241
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,890
We love to be dragged away from school.
Thank you.

242
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:27,309
Are you a detective, monsieur?

243
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,481
Yes. And monsieur here
is the crown prosecutor.

244
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:35,275
Hello.

245
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,320
- Would you like a biscuit?
- Please.

246
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,157
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

247
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:43,658
Thank you.

248
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,161
Now, my little ones, tell me everything.

249
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:50,040
Your mother called us saying that you
had passed the Villette house last night.

250
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,417
- That's right.
- And what was the time?

251
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:55,420
- 11:00
- No, it was after 11:00.

252
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:59,341
- Well, now, which one of you is right?
- Well, we had been babysitting

253
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,843
but we didn't go straight home.
That's why.

254
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,721
Well, shall we say, then,
between 11:00 and 11:30?

255
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,015
- Yes.
- So. And what did you see?

256
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,851
We saw someone leaving the Villette house.

257
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,395
- A man or a woman?
- Man.

258
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,564
- Well, what was he like?
- He was a priest.

259
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,650
- What?
- A priest.

260
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,528
Now this is very important.
Are you sure?

261
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:22,072
Quite sure.

262
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,956
Tell us exactly.

263
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,959
Well, on our way home
by the Rue Valentine

264
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,877
we passed Monsieur Villette's house.

265
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,796
We know it well.

266
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:41,091
It was very dark, and she was frightened.

267
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:45,053
- I was not.
- Yes, you were, and we began to hurry.

268
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,306
And then suddenly, there was this priest.

269
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,726
He was coming out of the house
and walking away.

270
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,146
- Did you see his face?
- No.

271
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,565
How tall was he?

272
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,610
Like him.

273
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,198
- Was he fat or thin?
- Not fat. Not thin.

274
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,535
Did you notice
anything special about him?

275
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,245
- No.
- Did he see you?

276
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:11,579
I don't think so.

277
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,457
But you are absolutely sure
he was a priest?

278
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,334
Yes.

279
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,424
Thank you. You may go now.

280
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:29,014
My little ones, I do not want you
to say anything to anyone about this.

281
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,141
- Promise.
- Yes.

282
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,600
Thank you.

283
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:37,480
Murphy, I want you to check
every rectory in town

284
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,608
and find out which priests
were out late last night.

285
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:42,027
Yes, sir.

286
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:49,826
Of course, it's absurd
that a priest would be involved.

287
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,246
You don't really think
it could be a priest, do you?

288
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,956
Yes, maybe.

289
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,167
- Who?
- I have to make sure.

290
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,502
I can't tell you
until I've checked further.

291
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,796
Well, don't be so mysterious.

292
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,663
Most of his time
is given to his parishioners.

293
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,999
Was he with one on Tuesday night?

294
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:41,002
I have no idea where he was
or what he did.

295
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:45,465
But I'm perfectly sure it's all right.
He will tell you so himself.

296
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,009
Come in.

297
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,932
- Good evening, Father Logan.
- Good evening.

298
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,685
Oh, I believe this room has given this
gentleman from the police department

299
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:02,941
the idea that we hide grime with paint,
but it is not so, Mr. Murphy.

300
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:07,195
We have made certain
that the walls underneath are spotless.

301
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,865
I don't question that, Father.
Sorry to bother you, Father.

302
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,909
It's no bother. What can I do for you?

303
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,079
It seems that Inspector Larrue
wishes to speak to you.

304
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,832
Would it be convenient for you
to come down to the office with me now?

305
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,084
Certainly. Certainly.

306
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,921
It's all right, Father,
I... I told Mr. Larrue I'd be available.

307
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,214
Good night.

308
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,363
What is it, Father? Who was that man?

309
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,783
The police want to ask
Father Logan some questions.

310
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,328
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Oh, now you're bringing
your bicycle into the study.

311
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,748
How much further into the rectory
are you gonna push it?

312
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,341
Alma, have you washed the cassock?

313
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,218
Not yet.

314
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,179
Where is it?

315
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:15,763
It's in our room.

316
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,600
Don't wash it. I don't want it washed.

317
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,311
- But why?
- Listen to me.

318
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,899
Very sorry to have
kept you waiting, Father.

319
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,317
I was occupied on the telephone.

320
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:30,028
It's all right, Murphy.
I'll call you later.

321
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,199
Unpleasant bit of business,
isn't it, Father?

322
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:35,450
It is, yes.

323
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,410
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

324
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:42,665
Well, just a few questions,
and we'll get it over as soon as possible.

325
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,918
You've been at St. Marie's for how long?

326
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,086
- For nearly two years now.
- Mmm.

327
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:52,300
I have known Father Millars for...
For a... A long while.

328
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,470
As a matter of fact, I was a choirboy
when he was over at the basilica.

329
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:56,971
- Really?
- Mmm.

330
00:25:57,932 --> 00:26:00,892
I've heard that you saw military service
during the last war.

331
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:02,602
- Yes.
- I believe you were awarded

332
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,312
the Military Cross.

333
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,605
Yes.

334
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,691
You seem to have done
a number of brave things.

335
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,526
Well, I survived.

336
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,737
Are you given to understatement, Father?

337
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,656
Well, that depends.

338
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:20,203
This case, this Villette murder,
is all understatement so far.

339
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,665
- You knew Villette, didn't you, Father?
- Slightly, yes.

340
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,000
Then perhaps you can give me some help.
What was he like?

341
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,419
Well, unfortunately,
I didn't know him well.

342
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,506
Well, did you know him
socially or in a business sort of way?

343
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,341
In neither way, actually.

344
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:35,635
I'd met him once many years ago.

345
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,845
- Cigarette?
- Thank you, no.

346
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,430
Hmm.

347
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,184
No one seems to have known this Villette.

348
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:46,396
And yet he was a lawyer, he had clients.

349
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,566
Not one of his clients have
any information to give about the man.

350
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,485
Not that you, Father,
were a client of his,

351
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,029
as you say, you hardly knew him.

352
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,740
But, may I ask what were you going
to see him about yesterday morning?

353
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,911
Well, that... That was a personal matter.

354
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,206
Or you were acting for someone?
One of your parishioners, perhaps.

355
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:09,544
I can just say that my visit didn't have
anything to do with Villette's death.

356
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,838
Well, of course it didn't, Father.

357
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,339
But you do understand, don't you,

358
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,550
that I must consider
every scrap of information?

359
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:18,011
- Yes.
- When a murder has been committed

360
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,972
each scrap of information
is important to the police.

361
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:22,181
Of course.

362
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:25,643
I know sometimes
it seems like, uh, prying.

363
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,396
- It can be very embarrassing.
- I'm not embarrassed, Inspector.

364
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,356
Good. Very good.

365
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:35,361
I've been wondering about the lady
you met outside Villette's house.

366
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:40,283
Quite by chance, I happened
to see you from inside the house.

367
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:44,037
Inspector, the appointment
that I had with Villette

368
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,955
couldn't be of any importance to you.

369
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,166
But we aren't discussing that
at the moment, Father.

370
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:53,004
You see, with a murder, one has
to jump from one detail to another.

371
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,006
Forgive me,
perhaps I jumped too suddenly for you.

372
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,758
Well, it seems maybe I don't

373
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:58,259
follow as fast as you jump.

374
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:01,429
I have a methodical mind.
I do have to take things one by one.

375
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,639
So do I.

376
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,808
So do I.

377
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:09,437
The difficulty, perhaps,
is that, well, we aren't thinking

378
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,606
from the same point of view.
Could it be that, Father?

379
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:16,569
That could be. I don't really know
what your point of view is.

380
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:18,446
Oh.

381
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:21,532
Well, then I've put it badly. Very badly.

382
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:24,577
Let me try again.

383
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:28,122
Now, this lady that you met
outside Villette's house...

384
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,875
I wish I could discuss it, but I can't.

385
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,960
- But who is she?
- She isn't involved.

386
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:36,339
- That is for me to decide, Father.
- I... I know, I know.

387
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,591
But you'll have to take my word for it.
She's not involved.

388
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:42,011
I respect your word, but I need your help.

389
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:45,098
I'm not able to help.

390
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,683
I see.

391
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,479
I see, of course.

392
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:59,112
I just don't want all this mystification
to make things too awkward for you.

393
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:00,655
Awkward for me?

394
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,867
A priest was seen leaving Villette's
house at the time of the murder.

395
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,495
I saw a priest outside Villette's house
the next morning.

396
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,666
- Well, Father?
- Well?

397
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,377
Too much mystification
might lead one to believe

398
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,546
that both priests were one and the same,
mightn't it?

399
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,757
What have you to say?

400
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:22,301
Well, what would you want me to say?

401
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,512
That is up to you, Father.

402
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,392
Well, then, I would say
that a man of intelligence

403
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:32,562
would not be led to believe
anything on so little evidence.

404
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,314
You're perfectly right.

405
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,860
We have checked on every priest in Quebec.

406
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,154
Each could account for his movements
at the time of the murder,

407
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,613
that is, each except one.

408
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,868
Where were you at 11:00, Father?

409
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:50,371
- I was walking.
- Alone?

410
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,706
No.

411
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:52,957
Good.

412
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:57,628
Now, if you will just give me
the name and the address of the person.

413
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:00,131
I can't.

414
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,430
Father.

415
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,683
Don't you wanna help me?

416
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:14,061
- I've done my best.
- But you refuse to answer my questions.

417
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:18,524
I'm sorry. I know, I...
It isn't possible for me to answer them.

418
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,401
Then it's a pity.

419
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:21,819
A great pity.

420
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,075
Good night, Father.

421
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,081
I'm deeply sorry.

422
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:37,084
Good night, Inspector.

423
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,897
Get me Mr. Robertson.

424
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,107
Yes, the crown prosecutor.

425
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,361
What?

426
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,154
I don't care where he is, find him.

427
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,782
I said, find him wherever he is.

428
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,245
Take it slow. Come on.

429
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:13,913
Come on.

430
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,167
Lower. You have to get much lower.

431
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,469
Willy, you're wanted on the telephone.

432
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:33,474
- That's no fair. Leave me alone.
- I'm not kidding. You really are.

433
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,601
See what they want, Ruth.

434
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,485
All right, Ruth, where are you?
I'll take it.

435
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,113
- You idiot.
- Thank you.

436
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,616
Hello. Hello, yes, this is Robertson.

437
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,118
It's you, Larrue.

438
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,370
- Fix me a drink, will ya?
- Scotch and soda?

439
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:55,830
Just scotch, no water.

440
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:57,206
Yes, hello.

441
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:01,168
You ought to be in bed with a thriller
instead of worrying people.

442
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:02,503
Oh?

443
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,422
Yes, yes, I'm listening.

444
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,261
- Drink, darling?
- I'll get it.

445
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:13,472
What? But aren't you
jumping to conclusions?

446
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,641
Are you sure?

447
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,560
Yes, I see.

448
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:21,188
Yes. Yes, Inspector, yes.
I'll be right over.

449
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,109
Willy, don't look so unhappy.

450
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:28,279
I can't help it.
Murder's not particularly pleasant.

451
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,990
By now, you should be able
to take that in your stride.

452
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,575
Not this one.

453
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:35,953
- Is it about the Villette murder?
- Yes.

454
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:41,167
And the unpleasant part of it is,
a priest is suspected.

455
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,711
- What nonsense.
- Fantastic, isn't it?

456
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:47,256
But a priest was actually seen
leaving Villette's house.

457
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,924
Which priest?

458
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:52,720
Well, Larrue thinks it's Logan
from St. Marie's Church.

459
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,347
Do you know him?

460
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:55,806
I've heard of him.

461
00:32:56,725 --> 00:33:00,978
Well, I must be off. I hate to.
Thanks for a lovely party.

462
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,438
- Good night, Willy.
- Good night, Willy.

463
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:03,856
Good night, Ruth.

464
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,567
- You'll find your way out, won't you?
- Oh, yes, all right.

465
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,403
- Good night, everybody.
- Good night.

466
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,448
Ruth.

467
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,575
We have guests, Pierre.

468
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,570
It was a good party, wasn't it?

469
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,786
- Ruth.
- Yes?

470
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,538
Stop worrying.

471
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:03,457
- About what?
- Logan. The whole idea is ridiculous.

472
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,377
- Why on earth...
- Shut up, please. Shut up.

473
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,379
Pierre, I'm sorry.

474
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,382
You're still in love with him.

475
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:12,842
That should be apparent.

476
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:18,639
- You never spoke about it.
- Well, I'm not going to talk about it now.

477
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,726
Yes. You are going to speak about it.

478
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,811
I'm not going on like this.

479
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:29,316
- You don't have to.
- What do you want me to do?

480
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,152
Whatever you wish.

481
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:35,489
Very simple, isn't it? What does one do
when one's wife is in love with a priest?

482
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,327
- You can leave me.
- How easily you can say that.

483
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,706
I'm not in love with you. I've never been
in love with you, you know that.

484
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:49,503
But I never wanted to believe it.

485
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:52,673
That's not my fault.
I've never pretended anything with you.

486
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:57,636
I hope he's in trouble, terrible trouble.

487
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,103
Michael.

488
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,106
My poor Michael.

489
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,504
Hello? I'd like to speak
to Father Logan, please.

490
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,464
Father Logan?

491
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,925
Oh, but he's asleep.

492
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,886
- I'm not asleep.
- It is very late.

493
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,513
I'll take it.

494
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,892
Thank you.

495
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,520
Hello, this is Father Logan.

496
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:49,855
I've got to see you.

497
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,066
No, I've got to see you.

498
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,027
I can't tell you now. Tomorrow?

499
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,072
No, not at the rectory, please.

500
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:02,868
Michael, listen.
I've got to meet you somewhere. Anywhere.

501
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,746
Are you listening?

502
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:09,917
I'm going to Lיvis tomorrow morning
on the 9:00 ferry.

503
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:11,627
All right.

504
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,130
Good night.

505
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:20,988
Good morning.

506
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,240
Good morning, Father Logan.

507
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,995
We shouldn't be seen together,
for your sake.

508
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:29,830
I had to see you.

509
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,458
Ruth, the police have been questioning me.

510
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:35,920
They saw the two of us talking outside
of Villette's house the other morning.

511
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:39,798
- They're trying to find out who you are.
- I don't care. I've got to tell you.

512
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,508
You are being suspected.

513
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:43,093
I know that.

514
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,055
Ruth, you..
You shouldn't be seen talking to me.

515
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:49,016
There are probably police
all over the boat.

516
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:02,321
The only thing is for me to tell them
you were with me that night.

517
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:05,824
- You can't. They'd wanna know why.
- Do you think I care?

518
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,369
I'll tell them everything if I have to.

519
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,288
Ruth, you've got to think of yourself,
you've got to think of your husband.

520
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,375
Think of Pierre?

521
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:17,211
Think of him before I think of you?

522
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,798
- I've never been able to do that.
- You must.

523
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,717
It's too late to think of him.

524
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,552
We spoke of you last night.

525
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:29,264
He's still in love with me.

526
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,892
I'm not that good.

527
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,648
I love you, Michael.
I've always been in love with you.

528
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:39,984
I know.

529
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,569
I know it's wrong. I can't help it.

530
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:46,073
Do you want me to lie to you?

531
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,492
No, I don't want you to lie to me.

532
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:52,413
- But I don't want you to lie to yourself.
- But I haven't changed, Michael.

533
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:55,749
I've been married seven years,
and I haven't changed.

534
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,169
Are you afraid of me?

535
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:00,587
Why?

536
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,090
Why?

537
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,594
You're in love with me.
You've always been in love with me.

538
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,763
- You haven't changed.
- Ruth, I've changed.

539
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,056
You've changed, too.

540
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,934
You want me to pretend that.

541
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,645
No, I don't want you to pretend.

542
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:20,399
Ruth, do you understand?

543
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:24,820
I chose to be what I am.
I believe in what I am.

544
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,280
Michael.

545
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:29,742
I... I want you to see things as they are
and not...

546
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:33,328
And not go on hurting yourself.

547
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,461
Don't pity me.

548
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,800
I... I shan't bother you again.

549
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:05,194
And you followed her from the ferry
to 22 Grande Allיe?

550
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,487
Yes, sir.

551
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,697
This is absurd, Larrue.

552
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:12,493
That is all, Sergeant Farouche.
Murphy, thank you.

553
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,664
This will be very embarrassing for me.

554
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,833
Why should it be, sir?

555
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:25,089
I... I shall have to apologize
to Madame Grandfort for this...

556
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:27,466
This ridiculous report
your men have turned in.

557
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,719
I will apologize, sir,
if an apology is necessary.

558
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,973
Very well.

559
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,643
I'll call Madame Grandfort tomorrow.

560
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,561
Why not get it over with, sir?

561
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:43,232
And then we can get on
with the apologies, if necessary.

562
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,203
Hello, Pierre. Uh, this is Willy.

563
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,455
Oh, no. No.

564
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:01,583
Is Ruth there? Yes, please.

565
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,546
Hello, Ruth.

566
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,798
I see.

567
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:12,052
Yes, I understand. Yes. Of course.

568
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:16,223
That's very kind of you. Thank you.

569
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:19,726
What does Willy want?

570
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,522
He wants me to come to his office now.

571
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,108
May I ask you why?

572
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:29,570
I was seen on the ferry this morning
with Michael Logan.

573
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:31,738
Apparently, I was followed by a detective.

574
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:33,574
Could you have picked a less public place

575
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,284
- if you had to see...
- Pierre.

576
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,785
I'm sorry.

577
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,289
Would you like to tell me
what you're going to do?

578
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:44,626
I'm going to answer whatever questions
the inspector wishes to ask me.

579
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:48,881
I'm also going to explain that Michael
could not have killed Villette.

580
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:52,843
Has Father Logan cleared himself
to your satisfaction?

581
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:54,678
He didn't have to.

582
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,598
I was with him at the time.

583
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,938
Would you like me to go with you?

584
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:09,067
I'm in no position to ask
any favors of you, Pierre.

585
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,870
- Monsieur and Madame Grandfort.
- Do come in.

586
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,956
I'm extremely grateful that
you are both so cooperative.

587
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:26,460
- Ruth, Pierre, I'm terribly sorry.
- It's perfectly all right.

588
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:28,629
Mr. Larrue has promised
to keep this from the press.

589
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,339
No, I... I will do my best.

590
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,132
Sit down, please.

591
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,889
- Father Logan's outside.
- Oh. Bring him in. Come in.

592
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:42,476
I've asked Father Logan to join us.

593
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:43,977
Father Logan,

594
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,480
Madame and Monsieur Grandfort,
Mr. Robertson.

595
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,483
- Me, you know.
- Good evening, Father Logan.

596
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:51,401
- Good evening.
- Sit down.

597
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:52,861
Thank you.

598
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:02,329
May we begin, please?

599
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:03,830
Well, Madame Grandfort...

600
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:05,791
What do you wish to know?

601
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:09,586
You met and talked with Father Logan
on the 9:00 Lיvis ferry this morning.

602
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,714
- Yes.
- May I ask the reason for this meeting?

603
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:16,176
I don't think the reason
could help you, Inspector.

604
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:19,346
- It was personal?
- Yes.

605
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,056
Very well.

606
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:23,225
You also
met and spoke with Father Logan

607
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:25,435
on the morning following
Villette's murder.

608
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,855
You met and spoke to him on the pavement
immediately in front of Villette's house.

609
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,400
- Yes.
- May I ask the reason for that?

610
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:33,610
I had had an appointment
with Monsieur Villette.

611
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,320
He was your lawyer?

612
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,571
No.

613
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:40,617
Father Logan, knowing of the murder,
stopped you from entering the house.

614
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,160
- Am I right?
- Yes.

615
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:43,370
Of course, he did not know

616
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:45,372
that you had an appointment
with Monsieur Villette.

617
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,540
He did.

618
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:50,043
The night before,
I'd had an appointment with Father Logan.

619
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:54,214
I told him I was going to meet Monsieur
Villette at 9:30 the following morning.

620
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:57,050
You had an appointment with Father Logan

621
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,511
on the night Monsieur Villette
was murdered?

622
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,221
- Yes.
- Where?

623
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,056
We took a ride in my car.

624
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,642
- What time?
- Between 9:00 and 11:00.

625
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:11,523
Madame Grandfort.

626
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,609
- Are you sure of the time?
- Oh, yes.

627
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:19,156
I got home just after 11:00. My husband
had come in five minutes before.

628
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:20,365
That's right, Inspector.

629
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:26,747
You, uh, told your husband, of course,
that you had just seen Father Logan?

630
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,835
No, I did not tell my husband.

631
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:37,674
Was there any particular reason
why you shouldn't have told him?

632
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:39,634
Yes.

633
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:41,928
Inspector, I beg you.

634
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,598
Consider if your line of questioning
has to be so personal.

635
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,600
That is for me to decide, Father.

636
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,396
- Madame Grandfort?
- Yes?

637
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,732
You understand, don't you,
that I must ask these questions?

638
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,776
Yes. But I came here to tell that you

639
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,570
that Father Logan could not have been
involved in Monsieur Villette's death.

640
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,114
I was with him at the time.

641
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,825
I have accepted everything
that you have said, madame.

642
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,327
But I must know, if possible,

643
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:07,788
the reason for your appointment
with Monsieur Villette.

644
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,667
Monsieur Villette was blackmailing me.

645
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,046
I had met Father Logan to ask his advice.

646
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,303
You had not told your husband about this?

647
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:28,392
- It was...
- It was what, madame?

648
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:30,477
It was nothing to do with my husband.

649
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:32,938
I'm sure he would have been concerned
had he known about it.

650
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:34,773
Yes. You see, that was it.

651
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,108
I didn't want to worry him.

652
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:37,984
- So you turned to Father Logan.
- Yes.

653
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:41,154
Is Father Logan your parish priest?

654
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,698
- No.
- No?

655
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,325
Yet you turned to him for advice

656
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:47,619
in a matter about which
you would not turn to your husband.

657
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,663
Father Logan is an old friend.

658
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:51,665
And he advised you, of course,
to tell your husband.

659
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:53,041
No, how could he? He couldn't do that.

660
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,506
Before your first appointment
with Father Logan,

661
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,425
he knew, of course,
that you were being blackmailed?

662
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:04,469
How could he? I hadn't seen him in years.

663
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:08,014
You hadn't seen him in years, and yet
you say he was an old friend of yours.

664
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:11,351
Mr. Larrue.

665
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:13,812
- Inspector?
- Yes, sir?

666
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:16,440
My wife does not have to
answer those questions.

667
00:46:16,566 --> 00:46:18,358
She's not under oath.

668
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:21,528
Your wife was seen outside
Villette's house with Father Logan.

669
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,031
She was seen again this morning
with Father Logan.

670
00:46:25,158 --> 00:46:26,700
She told us of an appointment
with Father Logan.

671
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:29,828
An appointment that took place
the night Monsieur Villette was murdered.

672
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:33,665
Surely, Monsieur Grandfort

673
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,668
you do not want your wife
to implicate herself further.

674
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,004
It is you who are trying to implicate her.

675
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,881
My wife came here to answer questions

676
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:45,010
and to clear, as far as possible,
Father Logan of any suspicions.

677
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,220
She has done both of those things.

678
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:50,390
Madame Grandfort,
why were you being blackmailed?

679
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,350
You don't need to answer that.

680
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:54,978
Why shouldn't she, Father?

681
00:46:56,189 --> 00:46:57,522
What are you afraid of?

682
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,441
It isn't necessary. Don't answer.

683
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:03,487
Madame Grandfort,
are you trying to protect Father Logan?

684
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:06,198
From what? He hasn't done anything.

685
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,451
It would seem as if he had.

686
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,500
Are you a human being, Inspector?

687
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:21,796
You think it's important
for me to tell you

688
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:24,090
why I was being blackmailed.

689
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:29,137
You don't care whom I hurt, just so long
as I answer all your questions.

690
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:32,390
- I only want to clear a murder.
- Yes, I know.

691
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,310
You only want everything clear.

692
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:38,772
And I want to clear Father Logan.

693
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,565
- Ruth.
- Willy.

694
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,817
May I have a glass of water, please?

695
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:46,488
Ruth.

696
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:50,534
Pierre, why must you hear
what I'm going to say?

697
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,877
Thank you, Willy. Inspector.

698
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:05,590
The blackmail was about
me and Father Logan.

699
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:10,053
Father Logan and I grew up together.

700
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:14,099
Have you ever been young, Inspector?

701
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:18,395
Of course, you know
that the first thing is to fall in love.

702
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:51,011
If we'd been engaged,
it wouldn't have mattered

703
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:54,973
because the war came.
He was one of the first to volunteer.

704
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,017
I hated him for that.

705
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,227
I was selfish even then.

706
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,938
He took things so seriously.

707
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:05,191
War and love.

708
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,777
Yes, even love.

709
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:11,990
Because when I said
we ought to get married,

710
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:14,993
he said there were enough widows already.

711
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,996
He said he loved me too much.

712
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,376
He didn't know
he could never love me enough.

713
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:27,255
That night, we went dancing.

714
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,424
It was our last evening together.

715
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,076
It was all too short.

716
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:00,038
That was the night Michael went away.

717
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:04,209
I thought the world was coming to an end.

718
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:09,673
I suppose there were millions of people
feeling the same way that night.

719
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:15,595
You don't think of millions of people.

720
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,603
You think of yourself

721
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:26,648
and the one you're in love with.

722
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:44,332
He asked me not to wait for him.

723
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:48,294
A lot of other boys must have said
the same thing to their girls.

724
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,380
I had to wait for him.

725
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:53,425
His letters were long at first,
but always serious.

726
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:55,510
I didn't want serious letters,

727
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:58,972
but I would prefer those
to no letters at all.

728
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:03,059
Because after a while,

729
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:05,937
he stopped writing.

730
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:11,276
Soon afterward, I...
I started working for my future husband.

731
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:13,987
Pierre was...

732
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,906
Pierre was...

733
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:21,369
Madame Grandfort,
perhaps if you are unable to continue...

734
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,246
It's all right. I...

735
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:24,539
I'm sorry.

736
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:28,168
Pierre was always so brilliant.

737
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,295
He was kind.

738
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:32,756
He realized I was unhappy.

739
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:35,800
And like very kind people,

740
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:39,095
he didn't ask me why.
He just tried to amuse me.

741
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,182
We got married.

742
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,225
I was happy.

743
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,227
I was through with...

744
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,481
I thought I was through with...

745
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,649
You know.

746
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:54,652
Well. Oh, yes. It...

747
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:59,032
It was at my wedding
that I saw Villette for the first time.

748
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:11,753
Then the war was over.

749
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:14,214
The men were coming home.

750
00:52:15,508 --> 00:52:19,052
I knew the day when he would come home.

751
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,139
On that day, I went down to the port.

752
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,142
A boat had just come in.

753
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:30,396
Suddenly, I saw him.

754
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:35,276
He had changed, I suppose,
but I didn't notice.

755
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:43,284
We arranged to meet the next day.

756
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,328
It was a lovely day.

757
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:47,539
The end of summer.

758
00:52:48,249 --> 00:52:50,959
Michael talked and talked.

759
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:55,755
He told me all the thoughts
that had come to him during the war.

760
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:58,466
I didn't want to hear about the war.

761
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,387
But the war had changed him.

762
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:09,769
Then a storm came up, so suddenly.

763
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:15,608
We saw a house across the field
and ran for shelter.

764
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:33,585
The house was closed.

765
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:07,994
I don't know what time it was.

766
00:54:16,629 --> 00:54:18,212
But it was late.

767
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:21,549
We had missed the last ferry
back from the island.

768
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:28,598
There was no way
I could get in touch with my husband.

769
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:34,687
It stopped raining in the morning.

770
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:02,966
A man came walking down
through the garden.

771
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,759
He walked as though he owned it.

772
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,930
As a matter of fact, he did.

773
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:13,351
I was still in the summerhouse
and he didn't know who I was,

774
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:17,313
but apparently, he knew I was a woman

775
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:21,150
because he made some remark to Michael.

776
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,152
Michael knocked him down.

777
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:26,739
I came out and stood on the steps of
the summerhouse, looked down at him.

778
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:31,911
He looked up at me and said,
"Good morning, Madame Grandfort."

779
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:35,456
It was Villette.

780
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:38,584
What could I say to Michael?

781
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,837
I hadn't told him I was married.

782
00:55:44,425 --> 00:55:47,093
I didn't see him again for five years.

783
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:51,389
Nor did I see Villette again,
until the day Michael was ordained.

784
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:24,130
Then I began running into Villette.

785
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,133
All the time.

786
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:30,053
He appeared everywhere I went.

787
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:40,772
One day in Parliament,
I was listening to Pierre.

788
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:42,482
Villette came up to me.

789
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:44,484
He said he was in trouble.

790
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,944
Something to do with a tax scandal.

791
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:49,572
Only my husband could help him.

792
00:56:49,698 --> 00:56:53,576
I told him Pierre would never
get involved in anything shady.

793
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:56,662
Then he threatened
to tell about Michael and me.

794
00:56:56,789 --> 00:57:00,666
What words could I say that would
tell him it was wrong about us?

795
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:03,044
Pierre's career would be finished.

796
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:05,379
Michael might be unfrocked.

797
00:57:05,506 --> 00:57:08,841
I tried to ignore him,
but he kept after me,

798
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,260
kept calling up.

799
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,268
Then one day, I ran into him again.

800
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,523
And he gave me 24 hours,

801
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:25,441
or else.

802
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:28,528
Oh, I was really desperate by then.

803
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:32,448
Then I thought that...
That maybe Michael might help.

804
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,285
And I rang him up. We met that same night.

805
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,872
He was very angry.

806
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:44,794
He said not to worry about Villette,
that he would deal with him.

807
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:48,965
And we arranged to meet the next day
in front of Villette's house.

808
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:54,095
I went there at 9:30.

809
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,805
I wondered at the crowds.

810
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:18,161
Then Michael told me Villette was dead.

811
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:20,246
I couldn't believe it.

812
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:22,206
I was free.

813
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:28,880
Well, Inspector?

814
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:31,048
May my wife leave now?

815
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:34,385
Certainly.

816
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:45,104
Father Logan has his alibi now,
doesn't he, Willy?

817
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:47,815
Of course.

818
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:51,903
Thank you.

819
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:00,995
Would you like to go now, Father?

820
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,498
- Good night.
- Good night.

821
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:06,626
Good night, Father.

822
00:59:10,339 --> 00:59:12,131
Well, it's over.

823
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:14,634
Is it, sir?

824
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,929
- Yes. Let's get out of here.
- Look, sir.

825
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:20,306
- What's that?
- The autopsy report.

826
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:23,726
Villette had dinner in a restaurant
at 9:00.

827
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:28,648
Examining his stomach, the doctors found
that he couldn't have died before 11:30.

828
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:29,941
Larrue.

829
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:32,985
Madame Grandfort said that
she left Father Logan at 11:00.

830
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,404
You can do a lot of things in 30 minutes.

831
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:42,995
Who is it?

832
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:44,372
Pierre.

833
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,041
Come in.

834
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,295
Sorry I woke you up.

835
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,922
I was awake.

836
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,715
Willy Robertson just called.

837
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,175
He's coming over.

838
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,427
What an odd time to pay us a visit.

839
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,179
Must be very early.

840
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,431
I'm afraid he's coming here officially.

841
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,475
Officially?

842
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:08,354
The statement you made last night,
it wasn't helpful.

843
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:12,358
At least not...
Not in the way you hoped it to be.

844
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:13,901
But I told the truth.

845
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,904
No one doubts what you said.

846
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,281
I don't see...

847
01:00:18,407 --> 01:00:20,950
You said you left Father Logan at 11:00.

848
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:24,996
Now they have established
that Villette was murdered at 11:30.

849
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:26,914
There's a time lag of half an hour.

850
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:38,467
Did they know about this time lag?

851
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:41,929
Did they know about it
before they questioned me?

852
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:49,228
Why did the inspector
allow me to say all those things?

853
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:53,941
There was no need for my statement.

854
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,405
- Why is Willy coming here?
- I asked him.

855
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:02,783
I want him to talk to you.
You may be called as a witness.

856
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:04,744
A witness?

857
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:06,912
Are they going to arrest Michael?

858
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:08,205
Yes.

859
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:11,876
But he hasn't done anything.
He had no reason to.

860
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:13,544
Why should they think he killed Villette?

861
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,087
Your statement answered that.

862
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:17,590
My statement?

863
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:20,426
He says you have given the motive
they've been waiting for.

864
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:22,762
I...

865
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:28,142
I should have lied, Pierre.

866
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,227
I lied before.

867
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:32,938
I should have lied last night.

868
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:36,442
They'll twist what I've said.

869
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:39,528
They'll turn it, they'll use it.

870
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:43,657
I've given them what they wanted.

871
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,916
I was going to help Michael,

872
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,587
but I've destroyed him.

873
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,635
And you, Pierre.

874
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,764
What have I done to you?

875
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:09,392
Willy will soon be here.

876
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,894
You must have your breakfast.

877
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:14,605
Would you like it here, in your room?

878
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,065
I will send it up.

879
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:28,661
You must do something.
They're going to arrest you.

880
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:31,080
Michael, what can we do?

881
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:33,249
I don't know.

882
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,210
You're not going to let them
bring you to trial?

883
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:38,212
You understand what that would mean.

884
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:40,464
You can't let that happen.

885
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,351
Michael.

886
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:56,522
I've done this to you.
There must be something I can do.

887
01:02:58,442 --> 01:03:00,526
There's nothing we can do.

888
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:05,364
Goodbye.

889
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:31,765
I beg your pardon. I'm so sorry.

890
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:33,893
It was my fault, madame.

891
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,271
I've been waiting to speak to you, Father.

892
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:21,649
You have been talking to the police, yes?

893
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:24,109
What did the police ask you, eh, Father?

894
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:27,238
They asked about me?
You told them about me?

895
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:30,407
I'm going to be arrested, Keller.

896
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:31,617
You?

897
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:35,204
Why would they arrest you, Father?

898
01:04:35,664 --> 01:04:37,456
You're trying to frighten me, perhaps.

899
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:40,125
You think by telling me that,
I will give myself up.

900
01:04:40,252 --> 01:04:42,545
You think I am easily frightened
after what I have done?

901
01:04:42,671 --> 01:04:45,172
So, what are you going to do
when they arrest you?

902
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:48,676
Perhaps you'll point your finger at me.
Perhaps you'll say, "It's Keller."

903
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,427
That's what you will do, is it?

904
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:53,097
You are a coward after all?
You are frightened?

905
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:56,517
Maybe they will hang you instead of me,
and that frightens you.

906
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:57,726
Perhaps you will tell them.

907
01:04:57,852 --> 01:05:00,521
You can't tell them
as long as you are a priest.

908
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:01,981
Can you?

909
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:37,182
The priest is frightened, Alma.
You saw the look on his face?

910
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,810
He thinks he can tell the police, yes?
I am ready.

911
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:00,831
I'd like to speak
with Father Logan, please.

912
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,541
Father Logan is not here.

913
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:05,085
- Good morning, monsieur.
- Good morning, Father.

914
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:07,421
I came to see Father Logan,
but Keller says he's not here.

915
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:11,050
Not here? He didn't say he was going out.

916
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:13,135
He didn't say anything to me.

917
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:14,637
I saw him.

918
01:06:14,763 --> 01:06:18,265
I tried to speak to him.
He seemed frightened.

919
01:06:19,017 --> 01:06:23,270
I asked him if I could do anything.
He didn't even hear me.

920
01:06:24,064 --> 01:06:29,234
He went out by that door
20 minutes ago, maybe 30.

921
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:32,154
Thank you. I'll be back, Father.

922
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,240
All right, Murphy, what is it?

923
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:38,994
What?

924
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,457
Stand by outside the rectory.

925
01:06:45,377 --> 01:06:46,919
Logan is gone.

926
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,678
Give me the radio room.

927
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:13,857
Will Father Logan be in for lunch?

928
01:09:16,528 --> 01:09:18,111
I don't know.

929
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:36,129
Any news yet?

930
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:39,341
All right.

931
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:47,140
Hello, Father.

932
01:09:52,564 --> 01:09:55,274
- Have you had your lunch yet?
- No.

933
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:58,026
Let me order something for you.

934
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:04,700
Mr. Murphy, would you tell us
where you found this cassock?

935
01:10:04,826 --> 01:10:06,410
I found it in a patent-leather trunk, sir.

936
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:09,621
Would you be able to say whether or not
the trunk belonged to the accused?

937
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:10,956
I would say that it did, sir.

938
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:15,043
His initials, M.W.L., were on the side
of the trunk. The trunk was in his room.

939
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:18,338
Would you say, Mr. Murphy, that the
cassock had been hidden in the trunk?

940
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:21,842
Did it seem as though placed
so as to, uh, escape detection?

941
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:24,720
Well, there were a lot
of other things covering it, sir.

942
01:10:25,013 --> 01:10:27,890
A raincoat, a pair of galoshes
and several books.

943
01:10:28,016 --> 01:10:31,059
- Thank you. Your witness.
- No questions.

944
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:33,061
That's all, thank you.

945
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:37,441
Call Dr. Bonnard.

946
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:02,925
The evidence you would give to the court
shall be the truth, the whole truth

947
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:04,259
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God.

948
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:05,510
I swear.

949
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:07,179
Your name?

950
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:08,889
Georges Bonnard.

951
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,475
- Your age, please?
- Forty-two.

952
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:14,019
- Your occupation?
- Pathologist.

953
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:17,689
Dr. Bonnard. You are a professor
at Laval University?

954
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:18,857
I am.

955
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:20,776
You have examined
the stains on this cassock?

956
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:21,902
I have, sir.

957
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:25,113
- Would you tell the court what they are?
- They're human blood.

958
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:27,658
Would you tell us what blood type
they belong to?

959
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:29,034
Type O, sir.

960
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:32,454
And is this the same blood type
as that of the murdered man?

961
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:33,747
It is, sir.

962
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:35,374
Thank you, Doctor.

963
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:40,462
On the night of the murder,
you spoke to the accused?

964
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:41,672
Yes, sir.

965
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:45,217
At what time did your conversation
with the accused take place?

966
01:11:45,385 --> 01:11:48,428
- A little after 11:45, sir.
- Hmm.

967
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:53,225
Would you tell the court of the events
that led up to this conversation?

968
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:54,685
Yes, sir.

969
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:59,856
My wife was asleep, sir,
and I was just about to go to bed.

970
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:05,445
I happened to look out of the window,
and there I saw someone enter the church.

971
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:08,907
I couldn't tell who it was
at that distance, sir.

972
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:12,911
So I went downstairs
and through the passageway

973
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:15,956
that connects the rectory to the church.

974
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:20,293
The light was dim, sir,
but I could see someone

975
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:23,797
who was kneeling against the altar rail.

976
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:29,428
As he lifted his head,
I recognized Father Logan, sir.

977
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:35,809
Was there anything about his manner
that seemed out of the ordinary?

978
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:40,605
He seemed distressed, sir.

979
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:42,649
Did you speak to him?

980
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:46,028
Yes, sir.
I asked him if he were ill.

981
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,280
He said no.

982
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:51,033
He said I should go back
and leave him alone.

983
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:54,870
- But you didn't leave him immediately?
- No, sir.

984
01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:56,872
Why was that?

985
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:03,128
Father Logan had always been very kind
to my wife and to me,

986
01:13:03,254 --> 01:13:05,630
so I wanted to help him if I could.

987
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:07,716
He seemed to need help?

988
01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:11,720
He seemed very,
very distressed, sir.

989
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:14,806
And yet,
he wouldn't let you help him?

990
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:19,644
No, sir. He said to me again,
"Go back, Keller. Leave me alone, Keller."

991
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:22,272
So I went back to my room.

992
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:28,904
You... You spoke to your wife
of this incident?

993
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:30,906
No, sir.

994
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:34,993
- Why not?
- She was asleep, sir.

995
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:39,706
And also, I didn't like to talk about it.

996
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,168
It didn't seem right to me

997
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:47,714
to mention such distress
as Father Logan's to anyone.

998
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:51,259
It seemed a very private distress, sir.

999
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:56,098
Madame Grandfort,
I'm only trying to clarify your testimony.

1000
01:13:56,224 --> 01:13:58,016
I've told you everything you need to know.

1001
01:13:58,643 --> 01:14:00,477
That is hardly for you to decide.

1002
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:04,022
Now, Madame Grandfort, will you please
answer my questions, "yes" or "no"?

1003
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:07,192
Some questions
cannot be answered that way.

1004
01:14:08,528 --> 01:14:12,489
Well, I'll try to rephrase it.
I'll try to help you.

1005
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:16,535
Now, it is true, is it not, that you had
an association with the accused,

1006
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:18,703
which you didn't wish
to become public knowledge?

1007
01:14:19,038 --> 01:14:21,623
You're twisting my words.
You haven't listened to what I've said.

1008
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:25,460
The witness will confine herself
to answer as to the facts.

1009
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:29,881
Madame Grandfort, let me repeat
your answer to my earlier question.

1010
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:34,928
You said that you were in love with
the accused before the war. Am I right?

1011
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:36,346
Yes.

1012
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,724
Then were you in love with him

1013
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:42,227
at the time of your marriage
to Monsieur Grandfort?

1014
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:44,396
- I object, My Lord.
- I refuse to answer such questions.

1015
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:47,107
- You have no right...
- Objection overruled.

1016
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:48,650
Madame Grandfort,
we have your signed testimony

1017
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:50,235
as to your relationship with the accused.

1018
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:52,112
Do you wish that testimony
read to this court?

1019
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,496
Then were you in love with the accused

1020
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:04,040
at the time of your marriage
to Monsieur Grandfort?

1021
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:08,003
Yes.

1022
01:15:08,379 --> 01:15:11,464
And still in love with him
on the night of the murder?

1023
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:20,765
Yes.

1024
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:27,230
Then isn't it possible that you met
with him between the night

1025
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:30,150
at the summerhouse
and the night Villette was killed?

1026
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:31,568
I did not.

1027
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:34,863
Madame Grandfort,
you can hardly expect the jury to believe

1028
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:37,490
that a woman in love doesn't make
some attempt to meet her lover.

1029
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:38,867
I object, My Lord.

1030
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:41,828
This line of questioning
doesn't seem particularly relevant.

1031
01:15:42,121 --> 01:15:44,956
But it is, My Lord. I'm trying
to establish a motive for the murder.

1032
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:47,959
I'm trying to discover
whether or not Villette's blackmail

1033
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:51,421
was based on his knowledge
not merely of one night at his summer home

1034
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:54,090
but also of a continuous,
uninterrupted, illicit...

1035
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:55,967
No, that's not true! Not true!

1036
01:15:56,761 --> 01:15:58,720
Silence! Silence!

1037
01:16:01,766 --> 01:16:04,976
Father Logan,
will you examine this garment?

1038
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:13,652
Is this your cassock?

1039
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:15,070
No, sir.

1040
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:18,240
Then did you, perhaps,
borrow this cassock from someone?

1041
01:16:18,366 --> 01:16:19,491
No.

1042
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:24,704
It's not yours, and you did not borrow it.
And yet it was found in your trunk.

1043
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:28,541
- Someone must have put it there.
- Yes.

1044
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:34,047
Have you any idea who might
have put this cassock in your trunk?

1045
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:37,926
I can't say.

1046
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:44,683
Father Logan, when did you decide
to become a priest?

1047
01:16:44,809 --> 01:16:46,017
After the war.

1048
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:50,522
In becoming a priest, were you,
perhaps, trying to hide from something?

1049
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:54,109
I had never thought of the priesthood
as offering a hiding place.

1050
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:59,489
I understand you to mean that priesthood
involves certain responsibilities,

1051
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:01,616
- certain moralities.
- Yes.

1052
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:05,370
You were aware of these
responsibilities, these moralities?

1053
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:06,663
Yes.

1054
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:11,251
And yet you saw nothing wrong in having
a clandestine meeting with a woman?

1055
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:15,380
Are you trying to imply that I was
a priest at that time? I was not a priest.

1056
01:17:15,548 --> 01:17:18,883
Did you take into consideration
that this woman was married?

1057
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:20,385
I wasn't aware that she was.

1058
01:17:21,721 --> 01:17:24,973
And so you spent the whole day
with this woman?

1059
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:28,935
Yes. We were good friends.
I hadn't seen her in over two years.

1060
01:17:29,729 --> 01:17:32,480
Such good friends
that you spent a night with her?

1061
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:34,649
We were caught in a storm.

1062
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:36,067
Oh?

1063
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:38,194
The storm was the villain.

1064
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:39,988
Did you warn Madame Grandfort that

1065
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:42,073
perhaps her husband
might not agree on that?

1066
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:45,243
As I said,
I didn't know she was married.

1067
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:47,037
And on discovering that she was

1068
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:51,041
did you make any attempt to explain
the situation to Monsieur Grandfort?

1069
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:52,250
No.

1070
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:55,086
But surely there is some contradiction

1071
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:59,758
between this... This secretiveness
and your vocation.

1072
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:03,595
I saw nothing wrong
being caught in a storm.

1073
01:18:03,763 --> 01:18:05,764
If there was nothing wrong,
why did you have

1074
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:09,142
such a violent argument with Villette
when he appeared next morning?

1075
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:12,520
Were you anxious to protect
Madame Grandfort's reputation?

1076
01:18:12,646 --> 01:18:13,772
Yes.

1077
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:16,358
Oh. Then her reputation was in danger?

1078
01:18:16,484 --> 01:18:18,902
Now, you realized suddenly,
that there was something more

1079
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:21,279
than merely being caught in the storm?

1080
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:23,740
Villette made an insinuation.

1081
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:27,702
My argument with Villette had nothing to
do with any sudden realization on my part.

1082
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:29,871
- And you hit him?
- Yes, I did.

1083
01:18:29,997 --> 01:18:31,456
- In anger?
- Yes.

1084
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,084
You are capable of hitting a man

1085
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:36,419
when he merely intrudes
upon a harmless situation.

1086
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:40,298
Then surely you are capable
of far more violent action

1087
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:44,511
when that same man blackmails
your good friend Madame Grandfort.

1088
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:46,262
I'm not capable of murder.

1089
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:48,640
You would allow such a man to destroy

1090
01:18:48,766 --> 01:18:51,851
Madame Grandfort's home
as well as your career?

1091
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:53,561
No.

1092
01:18:53,813 --> 01:18:57,065
You would go to such a man and,
unable to control your temper,

1093
01:18:57,608 --> 01:19:00,568
unable to face a public scandal,
you would turn to physical force.

1094
01:19:00,694 --> 01:19:02,153
No, I would not!

1095
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:07,325
Silence! Silence!

1096
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:13,206
You say you and Madame Grandfort separated
at 11:00 on the night of the murder.

1097
01:19:13,374 --> 01:19:14,666
That's right. Yes.

1098
01:19:14,834 --> 01:19:17,836
Then it was possible for you
to go to Villette's house.

1099
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:21,756
It was possible for you to arrive there
at 11:30, the time he was murdered.

1100
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:25,176
Yes, it was possible,
but I didn't go there.

1101
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:28,471
- I went right home to the rectory.
- Ah.

1102
01:19:28,848 --> 01:19:31,766
And what time did you arrive
at the rectory?

1103
01:19:31,934 --> 01:19:33,435
About 11:15.

1104
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:37,147
- Anybody witness this arrival of yours?
- I don't believe so.

1105
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:40,358
You say you arrived at 11:15.

1106
01:19:40,568 --> 01:19:43,778
- Uh, what did you do then?
- I went up to my room.

1107
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:46,281
- You went to bed immediately?
- No.

1108
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:50,535
- What did you do?
- I went into the church.

1109
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:53,288
Did you see anybody there?

1110
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:54,664
Otto Keller.

1111
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:59,127
Otto Keller has testified to this court
that he followed you into the church

1112
01:19:59,253 --> 01:20:03,006
and that he found you kneeling
before the altar in great distress.

1113
01:20:03,174 --> 01:20:07,719
He has further testified
that the time was then 11:45 or after.

1114
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:11,806
Well, it could have been 11:45.
The rest isn't true.

1115
01:20:12,475 --> 01:20:16,019
Perhaps you are prepared,
at last, to tell us the truth.

1116
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:20,231
It might have been 11:45.
The rest is not true.

1117
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:24,903
Perhaps you are prepared
to give us your version of the truth.

1118
01:20:25,905 --> 01:20:28,072
Of course you refuse to answer

1119
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:31,576
because I submit you did not return
to the rectory at 11:15.

1120
01:20:31,702 --> 01:20:34,412
As you say
you did not return until 11:45 or after.

1121
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:37,499
And that your distress, when discovered
by Otto Keller, was caused by the fact

1122
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:41,044
that only a short while before you had met
with Villette and been threatened by him

1123
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:43,671
with exposure of your affair
with Madame Grandfort.

1124
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:47,175
And that you had taken the first weapon
that came to hand and struck at Villette

1125
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:50,345
and continued to strike
until you cracked his skull wide open.

1126
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:51,888
No!

1127
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:56,267
I repeat, it is your duty

1128
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:59,437
to carefully examine
all the evidence that has been given

1129
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:03,942
and to determine whether the charge
against the accused has been proven.

1130
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:07,779
Remember also
that you are not trying the accused

1131
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:10,365
for whatever views you may hold

1132
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:13,409
as to his relationship
with Madame Grandfort

1133
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:16,913
except as it may affect
this charge of murder.

1134
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:18,915
One final point.

1135
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:23,002
The fact that the accused
is a priest under holy orders

1136
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:26,923
should not influence your verdict
one way or the other.

1137
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:30,426
You may now withdraw
to consider your verdict.

1138
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:01,583
But I believe what the prosecutor said.

1139
01:22:01,709 --> 01:22:05,169
Obviously, they didn't spend
just that one night together.

1140
01:22:05,296 --> 01:22:08,006
There must have been many more times.

1141
01:22:10,175 --> 01:22:11,175
Silence...

1142
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:54,636
Gentlemen of the jury,
are you agreed on your verdict

1143
01:22:54,762 --> 01:22:58,056
- and who will speak for you?
- We are.

1144
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:02,018
How say you? Is Michael William Logan
guilty of murder or not guilty?

1145
01:23:02,394 --> 01:23:05,229
While we attach grave suspicion
to the accused,

1146
01:23:05,773 --> 01:23:08,066
we cannot find sufficient evidence
to prove

1147
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:12,153
that he actually wielded the weapon
that killed Monsieur Villette.

1148
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:15,740
Therefore, our verdict is not guilty.

1149
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:23,247
Hearken to your verdict
as the court recorded it.

1150
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:26,542
You say Michael William Logan
is not guilty, so you say all.

1151
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,128
Yes.

1152
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:35,343
Monsieur, monsieur.

1153
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:40,431
- I told you that cassock...
- They've ruined him.

1154
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:43,309
Why couldn't they have said
"not guilty" simply and let it go at that?

1155
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:46,771
Your Lordship, I move that
the prisoner be released.

1156
01:23:47,272 --> 01:23:50,108
Michael Logan,
while I have no doubt that the jury

1157
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:53,319
must have reached their conclusion
in utmost fairness

1158
01:23:53,987 --> 01:23:56,072
and solemn regard for justice,

1159
01:23:56,448 --> 01:24:00,660
I cannot help expressing my personal
disagreement with their verdict.

1160
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:04,122
Michael William Logan,
you are hereby discharged.

1161
01:24:04,581 --> 01:24:06,958
Everybody stand up. Silence.

1162
01:24:17,136 --> 01:24:18,386
Michael.

1163
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:30,898
Take off that collar!

1164
01:25:15,903 --> 01:25:17,236
Preach us a sermon, Logan!

1165
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:42,428
Are you satisfied, Willy?

1166
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:44,555
Are you satisfied with... With all this?

1167
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:46,140
Do you think I've enjoyed it?

1168
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:08,246
Alma. Alma!

1169
01:26:10,207 --> 01:26:12,917
Alma! Alma, come here! Alma!

1170
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:18,673
Alma.

1171
01:26:18,799 --> 01:26:20,174
Stop it!

1172
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:22,134
He's innocent.

1173
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:26,764
My husband...

1174
01:26:38,068 --> 01:26:39,986
There he goes! In the hotel.

1175
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:49,287
All right. Quick, get a doctor.

1176
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:01,632
It hurts.

1177
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:05,303
- Could we move her inside?
- No, she should not be moved at all.

1178
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:06,512
She shouted something.

1179
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:08,764
What is it you were shouting, Mrs. Keller?

1180
01:27:08,891 --> 01:27:10,182
She said he was innocent.

1181
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:16,981
- Villette.
- Villette?

1182
01:27:17,316 --> 01:27:18,816
What about Villette, Mrs. Keller?

1183
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:30,995
What? What is it?

1184
01:27:31,705 --> 01:27:33,456
What is she saying?

1185
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:35,791
She says, "Forgive me."

1186
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:51,390
- Mr. Larrue, sir.
- Have you got Keller?

1187
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:54,060
He just ran in the Chגteau Frontenac, sir.

1188
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:56,187
- Get Farouche and his squad. Corrigan too.
- Yes, sir.

1189
01:27:56,313 --> 01:27:59,440
- And Murphy, I do not want him to be shot.
- But, sir, he's got a gun.

1190
01:27:59,566 --> 01:28:02,151
I know, I know. I don't want him dead.
I want to talk to him.

1191
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:03,444
Yes, sir.

1192
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:08,616
- She's gone.
- Come along, Father.

1193
01:28:08,742 --> 01:28:11,202
- Now, what about this Keller?
- What do you mean, Inspector?

1194
01:28:11,370 --> 01:28:13,079
He just shot his wife.
What was she trying to do?

1195
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:15,289
Was she trying to warn you or to save you?

1196
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:17,041
Now, this Keller works
as Villette's gardener.

1197
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:18,876
He also works in the rectory.

1198
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:20,878
Now, what more can you tell me about him?

1199
01:28:21,004 --> 01:28:22,755
Let me try and talk to him, Inspector.

1200
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:25,383
Talk to him, sure, of course, go ahead.
But where is he?

1201
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:42,817
Couldn't we have one entrance open?
At least one entrance?

1202
01:28:42,943 --> 01:28:44,235
No, no.

1203
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:48,698
Keep these people right where they are
for their own safety, please.

1204
01:28:49,032 --> 01:28:50,992
I want you to start in the basement
and work your way up.

1205
01:28:51,118 --> 01:28:54,078
Remember, I said no shooting.
Now, go ahead.

1206
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:32,116
Get an ambulance at once.

1207
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:35,494
Well, he just shot a man,
a chef in the kitchen.

1208
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:38,622
Now will you tell me anything
about him, Father?

1209
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:42,460
Father, what are you trying to do?
Protect this Keller?

1210
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:44,253
He's on the mezzanine going upstairs.

1211
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:46,964
In the ballroom.

1212
01:30:03,482 --> 01:30:04,940
Tell Larrue.

1213
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:25,169
Keller! Give yourself up!

1214
01:30:26,171 --> 01:30:27,338
Stay back!

1215
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:29,507
Have them send over some tear gas.

1216
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:34,386
- Keller!
- Inspector, let me go in.

1217
01:30:34,513 --> 01:30:36,680
Let me try and talk to him.

1218
01:30:37,099 --> 01:30:38,265
No.

1219
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:41,852
- Keller!
- What do you want, Inspector?

1220
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:43,729
I want you to give yourself up.

1221
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:46,190
Why would I do that?

1222
01:30:46,316 --> 01:30:48,109
Haven't you done enough harm?

1223
01:30:48,235 --> 01:30:50,528
I could do more, Inspector.

1224
01:30:50,695 --> 01:30:53,030
You've already shot two people.
Now, isn't that enough?

1225
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:55,533
And...

1226
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:58,702
And what about Villette?

1227
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:03,040
- Villette?
- Yes, what about Villette?

1228
01:31:05,001 --> 01:31:06,544
So the priest talked.

1229
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:13,801
Hey, Logan! Where are you, Father Logan?

1230
01:31:13,927 --> 01:31:15,219
Keller.

1231
01:31:15,554 --> 01:31:17,138
Ah, there you are.

1232
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:20,599
My only friend, Father Logan.

1233
01:31:22,227 --> 01:31:25,479
How kindly he hears my confession

1234
01:31:25,605 --> 01:31:29,525
and then a little shame,
a little violence,

1235
01:31:29,651 --> 01:31:32,403
that's all it takes to make him talk.

1236
01:31:32,654 --> 01:31:36,323
It was too much for you, huh?

1237
01:31:36,533 --> 01:31:40,870
You are a coward
like all other people, aren't you?

1238
01:31:41,163 --> 01:31:43,581
A hypocrite like all the rest.

1239
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:45,833
Pierre, take me home.

1240
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:53,090
Frank, try to get him in the shoulder
to make him drop that gun.

1241
01:31:53,258 --> 01:31:54,758
It'd be easier to get him in the leg, sir.

1242
01:31:54,885 --> 01:31:56,969
His shoulder. The right shoulder.

1243
01:31:57,095 --> 01:32:00,222
- We're going to shoot now, Keller.
- Don't make them do it, Keller!

1244
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:06,896
Father, don't go in...

1245
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:09,315
Coming to speak to me?

1246
01:32:12,944 --> 01:32:16,322
Put the gun away.
There's been enough bloodshed already.

1247
01:32:17,157 --> 01:32:19,158
You must not come closer, Father.

1248
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,246
I'll shoot you, you know.

1249
01:32:28,335 --> 01:32:30,085
You won't shoot me, Otto.

1250
01:32:30,212 --> 01:32:34,465
Why will I not shoot you?
Because you call me Otto

1251
01:32:36,176 --> 01:32:40,137
in such a friendly way,
like Alma used to call me Otto?

1252
01:32:41,765 --> 01:32:43,557
Where is my Alma?

1253
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:47,728
- She's dead.
- No.

1254
01:32:47,854 --> 01:32:50,814
- You killed her.
- It is your fault.

1255
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:53,192
I loved her.

1256
01:32:54,819 --> 01:32:57,821
It made me cry to see her work so hard.

1257
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:03,285
Those poor hands. Such beautiful hands.

1258
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:08,040
- She can't be dead.
- She is.

1259
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:12,294
Then I am as alone as you are.

1260
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:16,131
- I'm not alone.
- Oh, yes, you are.

1261
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:20,177
To kill you now would be a favor to you.

1262
01:33:20,762 --> 01:33:22,680
You have no friends.

1263
01:33:23,723 --> 01:33:26,850
What has happened to your friends,
eh, Father?

1264
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:30,562
They mob you, they call at you.

1265
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:36,026
It would be better
if you were as guilty as I am.

1266
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:42,449
Then they would shoot you quickly
and you mustn't suffer much.

1267
01:33:43,201 --> 01:33:44,827
Look...

1268
01:33:45,495 --> 01:33:46,662
Oh, Father!

1269
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:49,707
Help me. Quickly.

1270
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:51,542
Get the hotel doctor.

1271
01:33:51,668 --> 01:33:52,835
- And the ambulance?
- Yes.

1272
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:54,378
Forgive me.

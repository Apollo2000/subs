2
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,241
Excuse me, something
is happening...

3
00:03:55,274 --> 00:03:56,476
What the...?

4
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:42,675
Yeah, he's the one!

5
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:46,312
Pick him up,
you fucking weakling!

6
00:06:46,878 --> 00:06:48,380
- Pilot, get him to the stairs!
- Go!

7
00:06:48,413 --> 00:06:49,181
- Now take him.
- Go!

8
00:06:49,214 --> 00:06:51,017
- Come on! Move it!
- Lets move!

9
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,314
Move!

10
00:07:26,084 --> 00:07:28,054
- Hurry!
- He's shell-shocked!

11
00:07:52,377 --> 00:07:53,278
Fucking Astronomer,

12
00:07:53,312 --> 00:07:54,913
it's impossible to understand
this shit.

13
00:07:54,946 --> 00:07:56,115
Come with me!

14
00:07:56,414 --> 00:07:57,850
Come on!

15
00:07:58,817 --> 00:08:00,453
Just follow us, got it?

16
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:08,728
Come on, jump!

17
00:08:45,564 --> 00:08:46,766
Let's move!

18
00:08:59,077 --> 00:09:00,913
Let's go!
Move out!

19
00:09:25,437 --> 00:09:27,173
Come on.
That's it.

20
00:09:33,979 --> 00:09:36,182
Fuck. We're done for.

21
00:09:36,348 --> 00:09:37,950
There's no way out.

22
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,152
Told you so. I told you...

23
00:09:51,997 --> 00:09:53,098
Hey, don't...

24
00:10:09,981 --> 00:10:11,584
There's not much time!

25
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:16,222
From now on...

26
00:10:17,122 --> 00:10:19,124
...you're on your own.

27
00:10:43,415 --> 00:10:45,050
Wait!

28
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,986
Who are you?

29
00:10:47,352 --> 00:10:49,021
At least tell me.

30
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:50,890
Where are we going?

31
00:10:55,293 --> 00:10:57,263
Why, you wanna stay?

32
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:30,529
- What happened to me?
- How am I supposed to know?

33
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:33,532
Car accident maybe
or maybe an OD...

34
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,635
Am I dead?

35
00:11:36,735 --> 00:11:38,170
Coma.

36
00:11:38,636 --> 00:11:40,639
You saying this is like
a dream?

37
00:11:41,406 --> 00:11:43,208
It's memories.

38
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:46,545
- Whose memories?
- Everyone in a coma.

39
00:11:47,545 --> 00:11:51,517
Everyone who's in a coma
comes to the same place-- here.

40
00:11:51,617 --> 00:11:53,618
Our brain stores memories like
an electromagnetic field.

41
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:55,721
And if you're in a coma,
they become your reality.

42
00:11:55,754 --> 00:11:57,723
Like changing stations
on a radio.

43
00:11:57,756 --> 00:11:59,224
Look at that.

44
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,095
Buildings, objects, people...

45
00:12:04,162 --> 00:12:05,697
What we remember is here.

46
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,068
What we don't remember
or never knew, doesn't exist.

47
00:12:09,168 --> 00:12:11,236
Everything you're staring at...

48
00:12:11,336 --> 00:12:13,272
...memories.

49
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,098
It doesn't makes sense.

50
00:12:40,131 --> 00:12:42,201
What those people
in the street?

51
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:43,268
They aren't people.

52
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:44,803
I'm telling you,
these are memories.

53
00:12:44,836 --> 00:12:46,805
Ok, and what about
that black creature?

54
00:12:46,838 --> 00:12:48,774
Is that a memory, too?

55
00:12:49,474 --> 00:12:50,776
Hold on.

56
00:12:53,244 --> 00:12:54,546
Hold on!

57
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:10,029
Goddammit, Private Fly!

58
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:13,265
Make sure the perimeter is safe
or should I do it?

59
00:13:13,598 --> 00:13:15,067
I already completed it.

60
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:17,202
Then do it the fuck again.

61
00:13:20,305 --> 00:13:22,574
Where are we supposed
to be going anyway?

62
00:13:46,464 --> 00:13:48,801
- What, does this thing fly?
- Get the fuck in there.

63
00:14:04,516 --> 00:14:05,784
Think wormhole, but actually,
it's a memory gap.

64
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:07,719
One person remembers
the bus near a building,

65
00:14:07,752 --> 00:14:09,688
for someone else,
it's in a field.

66
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:12,758
The memories get all jumbled.

67
00:14:20,665 --> 00:14:22,734
Where is he? Where's Pilot?

68
00:14:25,236 --> 00:14:27,506
He distract the Reapers
with a whistle.

69
00:14:27,606 --> 00:14:29,508
Otherwise we would have
bitten the dust.

70
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,411
You let him do that...

71
00:14:33,444 --> 00:14:35,480
- You do that, you son-of-a-bitch!
- Hey!

72
00:14:35,513 --> 00:14:37,682
I told everyone, if we go there,
it's gonna be dangerous.

73
00:14:37,715 --> 00:14:39,885
And the fucking map you drew
was bullshit.

74
00:14:39,918 --> 00:14:41,586
There wasn't enough time,
I told you.

75
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:43,588
Everything has changed.
You were rushing me!

76
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:45,691
What the hell are we
doing there anyway?

77
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:52,698
It was worth it...

78
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:56,235
...believe me.

79
00:14:58,469 --> 00:15:02,508
Fly, show him around.
And get him settled in upstairs.

80
00:15:05,276 --> 00:15:06,478
Let's go.

81
00:15:13,685 --> 00:15:15,720
The show is over!
Now get back to work!

82
00:15:15,753 --> 00:15:18,256
Tank, what's up
with that path?

83
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:19,691
You waiting for the
fucking Reapers to come over?

84
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:20,525
Go blow it up already!

85
00:15:20,558 --> 00:15:22,360
We're running low
on explosives.

86
00:15:22,393 --> 00:15:23,895
We need to ration them.

87
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:26,732
Ration my ass.
Didn't you see how they jump?

88
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,740
We blow up all the paths
leading to our base here.

89
00:15:34,906 --> 00:15:36,908
But of course, someone
always remembers them,

90
00:15:36,941 --> 00:15:38,543
so they reappear.

91
00:15:38,576 --> 00:15:39,678
In order to contain
the Reapers,

92
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:41,446
we're on constant alert.

93
00:15:41,813 --> 00:15:43,315
We take turns
keeping watch here.

94
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,885
Yan says there's
an island in Coma

95
00:15:46,918 --> 00:15:48,854
that doesn't have
any Reapers on it.

96
00:15:49,254 --> 00:15:50,622
We're always on
the lookout for people

97
00:15:50,655 --> 00:15:52,391
who can help us get there.

98
00:15:52,724 --> 00:15:55,460
He's got a good feeling
about you, for some reason.

99
00:15:56,327 --> 00:15:57,161
You need to eat
and drink here.

100
00:15:57,195 --> 00:15:59,497
Hunger, cold,
yeah they're memories

101
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,266
but everything is like
in reality,

102
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:02,634
so we have to leave
the base sometimes.

103
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:04,970
Those of us from the squad,
go out for supplies.

104
00:16:05,003 --> 00:16:07,739
- I don't remember what my name was.
- Nobody does.

105
00:16:07,772 --> 00:16:09,507
By the way,
give yourself a nickname

106
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,475
before someone
chooses one for you.

107
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:11,543
Jesus fucking Christ!

108
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:14,312
This is a dream....
It's a... It's like a dream.

109
00:16:14,345 --> 00:16:15,480
Hey!

110
00:16:16,514 --> 00:16:17,582
A person just died
to save your frickin' life.

111
00:16:17,615 --> 00:16:19,551
Believe me,

112
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:21,553
you can't wake up.
Now except that.

113
00:16:21,586 --> 00:16:23,822
Your body is somewhere
in a coma and you're here.

114
00:16:23,855 --> 00:16:25,991
You can't change that.

115
00:16:38,536 --> 00:16:39,705
And what's this?

116
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:45,577
Dreams.

117
00:16:45,977 --> 00:16:48,413
They materialize
when we're asleep.

118
00:16:48,913 --> 00:16:50,983
They're like remnants
from reality.

119
00:16:52,617 --> 00:16:54,286
It's normal here.

120
00:16:55,453 --> 00:16:57,722
This is where Gnome lives,
Tank is here, then Spirit,

121
00:16:57,755 --> 00:16:59,791
The Astronomer,
me, Phantom.

122
00:16:59,824 --> 00:17:01,326
The rest live downstairs.

123
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:02,827
You'll receive clothes
and ammo from Tank.

124
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,930
You and Phantom
are a couple?

125
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,732
What?

126
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:19,444
It's empty.

127
00:17:20,411 --> 00:17:21,279
Spend a couple
of weeks here

128
00:17:21,312 --> 00:17:22,948
and the room
will start to get filled.

129
00:17:23,681 --> 00:17:25,284
Go on it, it's yours.

130
00:17:29,687 --> 00:17:32,023
Usually a newcomer goes
through a kind of an initiation.

131
00:17:32,056 --> 00:17:33,591
But in your case Yan decided

132
00:17:33,624 --> 00:17:35,393
to let you be a part
of the squad right away.

133
00:17:35,426 --> 00:17:37,562
You mean, uh,
the man on the balcony.

134
00:17:37,595 --> 00:17:39,965
Is that right?
I'm guessing he's the leader.

135
00:17:40,565 --> 00:17:42,534
He's been here
the longest.

136
00:17:43,434 --> 00:17:45,103
And he was out
of his Coma once.

137
00:17:45,136 --> 00:17:46,638
That's how we know
what this world is.

138
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:48,473
He taught us how
to survive here.

139
00:17:48,506 --> 00:17:50,509
All of us here,
owe him our lives.

140
00:17:50,742 --> 00:17:52,311
That means you as well.

141
00:17:55,046 --> 00:17:57,082
Alright then,
you get some rest now.

142
00:17:57,115 --> 00:17:58,784
We'll test your metal
tomorrow.

143
00:18:03,921 --> 00:18:05,624
Me and Phantom
are not together.

144
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,328
- No, that's not what I meant--
- Even though that's what he likes to think.

145
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:12,097
That's not how it is.

146
00:20:21,225 --> 00:20:22,828
Whoa!

147
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:26,465
You really are
something special.

148
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:30,735
Don't even think
of going back there.

149
00:20:31,636 --> 00:20:34,940
Dreams are tricky.
You can get lost.

150
00:20:35,773 --> 00:20:37,542
And then there's
no way out.

151
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:40,212
So, how are you?
You settling in ok?

152
00:20:41,145 --> 00:20:43,615
- As far as I can tell.
- Don't bullshit me.

153
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,252
Everyone here goes
mental at first.

154
00:20:47,285 --> 00:20:50,088
Listen, I was a little hard
on you back there.

155
00:20:52,056 --> 00:20:55,160
- No hard feelings, ok?
- Yeah, all cool.

156
00:20:56,894 --> 00:20:58,129
Peace?

157
00:20:59,931 --> 00:21:01,166
Peace.

158
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:03,635
Listen up,

159
00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:07,672
Yan, he's got this island
thing he's pursuing.

160
00:21:07,705 --> 00:21:10,008
It's a big deal
about chosen ones.

161
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:14,646
Well, not my business.
Really, ok by me.

162
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:17,115
I got people
to take care of.

163
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:19,183
Discipline's important
to keeping control...

164
00:21:19,216 --> 00:21:21,720
Yo, Gnome,
I'm totally with you.

165
00:21:23,254 --> 00:21:24,789
Good man.

166
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,260
I liked you from the start.

167
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,129
You're smarter
than the others.

168
00:21:32,296 --> 00:21:34,699
And stay away from my girl.

169
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:36,801
I like her, bro.

170
00:21:37,768 --> 00:21:40,672
She's acting out now.
That's ok.

171
00:21:40,705 --> 00:21:43,174
We're like,
almost there, you know.

172
00:21:43,207 --> 00:21:45,310
Hmm, I don't know about that.

173
00:21:52,116 --> 00:21:55,687
Yan might see
something in you.

174
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,589
He's not perfect.

175
00:21:57,622 --> 00:21:59,824
He's made mistakes
in the past, he has.

176
00:22:02,693 --> 00:22:06,231
But um... I'm the one
leading the squad, right?

177
00:22:07,098 --> 00:22:08,567
Not him.

178
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,102
And to think
we should be buddies,

179
00:22:11,135 --> 00:22:12,904
and yet you're
so fucking rude.

180
00:22:12,937 --> 00:22:16,207
All I wanted to say is that
she should decide for herself.

181
00:22:22,113 --> 00:22:24,716
You haven't figured out
jack shit, have you?

182
00:22:25,249 --> 00:22:27,586
- Get up.
- What for?

183
00:22:30,988 --> 00:22:32,958
Stand up, soldier!

184
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:35,994
On the double!

185
00:22:36,027 --> 00:22:38,296
Everyone's tired
of waiting for you.

186
00:22:58,082 --> 00:23:02,353
In Coma some people
develop unique abilities.

187
00:23:02,386 --> 00:23:04,122
It depends on
how they think

188
00:23:04,155 --> 00:23:05,790
and what they're good at.

189
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:07,992
Like Spirit here,

190
00:23:08,025 --> 00:23:09,894
has the ability to sense
if there's danger.

191
00:23:09,927 --> 00:23:11,729
He can also summon ghosts.

192
00:23:11,762 --> 00:23:13,798
The Astronomer creates
maps for us

193
00:23:13,831 --> 00:23:16,300
and Pilot can locate new people
who just arrived here.

194
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,802
In order to discover
those abilities,

195
00:23:17,835 --> 00:23:20,005
a person needs
a little push.

196
00:23:21,105 --> 00:23:23,074
To be put in danger.

197
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:41,993
I'm wondering what your
special ability is going to be.

198
00:23:42,793 --> 00:23:44,396
Gnome, give us another shot!

199
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,952
Hey!
Get your shit together!

200
00:24:08,152 --> 00:24:09,454
Try defending yourself.

201
00:24:24,969 --> 00:24:26,705
So far so bad.

202
00:24:27,972 --> 00:24:29,307
But you know,
sometimes these abilities

203
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,276
don't reveal themselves...

204
00:24:31,842 --> 00:24:33,978
...until you're in a real
combat situation out there.

205
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:35,947
That's what happened to me,
for instance.

206
00:24:36,881 --> 00:24:38,282
But we're not animals who
are gonna send you

207
00:24:38,315 --> 00:24:39,884
straight out to battle.

208
00:24:41,018 --> 00:24:45,090
My friend Gnome
built me a training machine.

209
00:24:45,556 --> 00:24:47,125
Bring me your little toy,
Gnome!

210
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,866
I said, go get it.

211
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,183
It's an enemy
for Christ's sake!

212
00:25:52,556 --> 00:25:54,125
Attack it!

213
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,163
Fight back!
You can do it!

214
00:26:30,895 --> 00:26:33,031
Why didn't you
defend yourself?

215
00:26:42,406 --> 00:26:44,509
What did you do
for a living, huh?

216
00:26:45,209 --> 00:26:47,478
An architect, I believe.

217
00:26:49,046 --> 00:26:51,616
Cable!
He's on your team now.

218
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:55,453
I don't think we've
had an architect here yet.

219
00:28:10,028 --> 00:28:13,264
Afternoon shift!
Wake up everybody!

220
00:28:13,564 --> 00:28:16,434
Let's go! Let's go!
Off to work!

221
00:28:39,556 --> 00:28:41,259
A little bit higher!
A little higher!

222
00:28:50,134 --> 00:28:51,435
Cable!

223
00:28:51,468 --> 00:28:54,171
We're going to see
your submarine, huh.

224
00:28:54,204 --> 00:28:56,207
To get the explosives on it.
We're running low.

225
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,341
You coming?

226
00:28:57,374 --> 00:28:59,010
Aye aye, Commander!

227
00:29:02,446 --> 00:29:04,515
Keep working, Architect.

228
00:29:06,617 --> 00:29:08,586
We don't want no fucking
freeloaders here.

229
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:24,035
Hey.

230
00:29:24,601 --> 00:29:27,171
You can't just sit around!
Now get back to work here.

231
00:29:30,574 --> 00:29:31,675
What's going on, huh?

232
00:29:31,709 --> 00:29:33,511
Because you're probably like,
one of the lucky ones,

233
00:29:33,544 --> 00:29:34,679
you know,
if you think about it.

234
00:29:35,746 --> 00:29:37,749
What makes me so lucky?

235
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:42,053
Yeah, you may not have those,
you know, super powers,

236
00:29:42,086 --> 00:29:43,388
and all that stuff like that.

237
00:29:43,754 --> 00:29:47,291
Eh, there are plenty of us
that didn't pass the test.

238
00:29:47,591 --> 00:29:49,460
It would've been
a mistake to take us.

239
00:29:49,493 --> 00:29:51,596
At least we don't
have to go out there.

240
00:29:51,762 --> 00:29:54,165
You're a lot safer anyway,
working here!

241
00:29:54,565 --> 00:29:56,300
So live your life!

242
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:59,503
Huh? And then you can move on
with your life and all.

243
00:29:59,536 --> 00:30:03,041
You know, when you're out of
the coma and back in life.

244
00:30:04,775 --> 00:30:06,411
Whole other world.

245
00:30:08,112 --> 00:30:09,647
That may take a while.

246
00:30:11,482 --> 00:30:13,618
Time flows differently here.

247
00:30:14,418 --> 00:30:16,487
We're not exactly sure
about this...

248
00:30:17,521 --> 00:30:20,691
...but it seems to be
in a ratio of 1 to 100.

249
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:24,428
Which means one day in reality
is several months in Coma.

250
00:30:24,461 --> 00:30:25,596
I've been here
for 15 years,

251
00:30:25,629 --> 00:30:27,532
you can live here
thousands of years.

252
00:30:29,199 --> 00:30:30,635
The question is,

253
00:30:31,635 --> 00:30:34,105
what do you want to do with
all that time on your hands?

254
00:30:34,138 --> 00:30:35,373
You're the one
who had me saved,

255
00:30:35,406 --> 00:30:37,608
why don't you tell me what my
reason here is supposed to be.

256
00:30:37,808 --> 00:30:38,909
It doesn't matter.

257
00:30:38,943 --> 00:30:42,446
We want to be here is for you
to determine yourself.

258
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:44,548
You can get by
doing menial work

259
00:30:44,581 --> 00:30:45,850
or you can explore
your abilities

260
00:30:45,883 --> 00:30:47,518
and we'll see what happens.

261
00:30:47,551 --> 00:30:49,220
Sometimes...

262
00:30:49,253 --> 00:30:51,755
...sometimes it's hard
to recognize what's going on

263
00:30:51,788 --> 00:30:53,424
certainly in the beginning.

264
00:30:53,457 --> 00:30:55,426
You feel like you should
be able to do something

265
00:30:55,459 --> 00:30:57,328
and then nothing
comes of it.

266
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:02,733
Yeah um, I think it must have
been a building I finished,

267
00:31:02,766 --> 00:31:05,436
but I don't know how.

268
00:31:05,469 --> 00:31:06,871
I want to try to build
something here

269
00:31:06,904 --> 00:31:09,140
and nothing works out at all.

270
00:31:12,743 --> 00:31:14,712
Well, Phantom wasn't lying.

271
00:31:14,912 --> 00:31:17,181
Sometimes we don't know
what our additional powers are

272
00:31:17,214 --> 00:31:18,716
until we're out there.

273
00:31:19,416 --> 00:31:21,786
But if you're new here,
of course, it's way too risky.

274
00:31:22,586 --> 00:31:24,355
In his case,
it worked out just fine.

275
00:31:24,388 --> 00:31:25,790
My god,
take a look at him,

276
00:31:26,356 --> 00:31:29,393
superhuman strength, speed.

277
00:31:29,426 --> 00:31:31,362
Natural leader for us here.

278
00:31:31,462 --> 00:31:33,297
I've seen a lot of people
come and go

279
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:36,634
and I'd say there's
a deeper reason

280
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:38,369
as to why we're all here.

281
00:31:38,535 --> 00:31:39,703
My take,

282
00:31:39,736 --> 00:31:42,673
everyone who's here didn't
quite make it in the real world.

283
00:31:43,273 --> 00:31:45,743
They didn't have
a future there.

284
00:31:47,244 --> 00:31:49,346
Yeah, but I got like,
no idea about myself.

285
00:31:49,379 --> 00:31:51,582
It's all just like
a vague recollection.

286
00:31:51,615 --> 00:31:53,651
Maybe that's for the best.

287
00:31:53,684 --> 00:31:54,919
How is that?

288
00:31:54,952 --> 00:31:55,953
Without the burden
of memories,

289
00:31:55,987 --> 00:31:58,723
we're a clean slate,
we can have a fresh start.

290
00:31:59,456 --> 00:32:02,627
Nobody can tell you
who you are but you yourself.

291
00:32:02,993 --> 00:32:05,630
This world is created
by our thoughts.

292
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:09,333
The rules are different here.

293
00:32:09,366 --> 00:32:11,569
And here,
unlike in reality,

294
00:32:12,336 --> 00:32:14,839
you can do whatever
the hell you want.

295
00:32:21,712 --> 00:32:23,981
But that doesn't mean,

296
00:32:24,014 --> 00:32:25,783
is that you shouldn't
do anything.

297
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,822
Grip it as hard as you can.
You got it?

298
00:32:31,855 --> 00:32:34,559
- Yeah.
- Hold on a second. A little straighter.

299
00:32:36,693 --> 00:32:38,229
What do you want?

300
00:32:38,695 --> 00:32:40,531
I'd like to go with you.

301
00:32:40,764 --> 00:32:43,801
What?
You should know your rank.

302
00:32:43,901 --> 00:32:45,469
Take him with you.

303
00:32:48,372 --> 00:32:49,840
What for?

304
00:32:50,474 --> 00:32:52,376
You're gonna take him
because I asked you to.

305
00:32:53,877 --> 00:32:55,313
He'll get killed.

306
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,448
So be it.

307
00:32:57,481 --> 00:32:59,617
We have enough people
for the manual labor here.

308
00:33:06,657 --> 00:33:07,525
Listen up...

309
00:33:08,492 --> 00:33:10,328
I got a meeting now,
I'll be right back.

310
00:33:13,397 --> 00:33:16,500
Excuse me, would it be
possible for me to try the gun?

311
00:34:22,532 --> 00:34:24,401
That's the tunnel Gnome
was talking about.

312
00:34:24,434 --> 00:34:26,570
- Yeah! That's my tunnel.
- We turn here.

313
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:34,712
I'm sorry,
but why is it "Gnome's tunnel"?

314
00:34:34,945 --> 00:34:36,847
Because I the one
who remembered it.

315
00:34:37,047 --> 00:34:39,016
Just like I'm the one
who remembers that shit

316
00:34:39,049 --> 00:34:40,951
we're going to see.
She's a beauty.

317
00:34:41,518 --> 00:34:43,454
This world is made up
of memories.

318
00:34:43,487 --> 00:34:44,922
Every once in a while
they can figure out

319
00:34:44,955 --> 00:34:46,457
the person it belong to.

320
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,958
By the way, the Astronomer
has this whole theory

321
00:34:47,991 --> 00:34:48,859
about out dreams.

322
00:34:48,892 --> 00:34:50,494
Ask him about it.
It's way out there.

323
00:34:50,527 --> 00:34:51,996
Come on.
Tell us, Astronomer.

324
00:34:53,163 --> 00:34:55,466
- I heard that it was a lot for you?
- What, dreams?

325
00:34:55,499 --> 00:34:57,668
- Yeah, in your room.
- Well, yeah.

326
00:34:59,102 --> 00:35:01,438
Because in Coma
there's consciousness

327
00:35:01,471 --> 00:35:02,806
and then who we are.

328
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:06,577
Here we lose our memories.
We've lose ourselves.

329
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,445
Got it?

330
00:35:08,212 --> 00:35:10,114
- Well...
- In dreams though,

331
00:35:10,147 --> 00:35:11,715
there's tons of information

332
00:35:11,748 --> 00:35:13,984
about what we remember
from real life.

333
00:35:14,017 --> 00:35:16,553
Even this place,
where we are now,

334
00:35:16,586 --> 00:35:18,789
exists in your dreams.

335
00:35:18,822 --> 00:35:21,025
You find yourself dreaming
about your dreams.

336
00:35:22,058 --> 00:35:25,796
- Ah, so that way you can come out of the coma?
- What are you talking about?

337
00:35:26,029 --> 00:35:27,197
Yan's already told you.

338
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:30,067
Anyone who tries to enter
his dreams and leave Coma die.

339
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,870
- What's so hard to get?
- That doesn't necessarily mean it's impossible.

340
00:35:32,903 --> 00:35:34,571
Who the fuck asked you, huh?

341
00:35:34,604 --> 00:35:35,773
Reapers!

342
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,415
No, no.
It's safe.

343
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:47,785
It'd be like, maybe
a two-day detour to here.

344
00:35:50,821 --> 00:35:53,157
- Can they see us?
- They sense us.

345
00:35:53,257 --> 00:35:56,694
We produce a signal,
a frequency.

346
00:35:56,827 --> 00:35:59,863
- That's why I made the whistle.
- What do you mean whistle?

347
00:35:59,896 --> 00:36:02,032
So that in
a worst case scenario,

348
00:36:02,065 --> 00:36:03,767
they're only drawn
to one of us.

349
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,901
Like Pilot, yeah.

350
00:36:04,935 --> 00:36:07,638
When you turn on the whistle
it attracts the Reapers.

351
00:36:08,171 --> 00:36:09,807
Then you blow yourself up
with dynamite

352
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,041
and take them down.

353
00:36:13,677 --> 00:36:15,179
If this world is made
of memories,

354
00:36:15,212 --> 00:36:16,680
then how did they get here?

355
00:36:16,813 --> 00:36:17,948
It doesn't make sense.

356
00:36:17,981 --> 00:36:19,583
It's us.

357
00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:24,455
What do you mean?

358
00:36:25,655 --> 00:36:27,425
Coma patients.

359
00:36:27,824 --> 00:36:29,893
Technically they're
brain dead,

360
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:31,862
however life support
is still on.

361
00:36:31,895 --> 00:36:33,831
The relatives can't let go.

362
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,500
The dead brain
manifests itself into that.

363
00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:39,837
They're in a perpetual
state of decay...

364
00:36:40,103 --> 00:36:41,472
...they're time eternal.

365
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:43,874
But they're able
to turn the living into

366
00:36:43,907 --> 00:36:46,110
the same black shit
they are made of.

367
00:36:46,676 --> 00:36:49,179
I'd rather have life support
turned off than be that.

368
00:36:49,212 --> 00:36:51,582
Enough of this shit!
Let's move out!

369
00:37:05,562 --> 00:37:07,932
Time to play!

370
00:37:20,544 --> 00:37:23,147
Hey Architect, bring an extra
pair of underwear?

371
00:37:23,613 --> 00:37:25,916
Yeah, they're trigger-happy
band of guys, they are.

372
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:27,551
- Who are you talking about?
- Security guards.

373
00:37:27,584 --> 00:37:30,020
- They're from his memory.
- Why would they shoot us?

374
00:37:30,053 --> 00:37:32,523
They shoot at all strangers.

375
00:37:32,556 --> 00:37:33,857
That's how I remember it.

376
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,593
Now listen up,
take this.

377
00:37:35,926 --> 00:37:39,663
If you twist it here and
it'll boost up your bio-signal.

378
00:37:39,896 --> 00:37:41,999
It'll attract the Reapers,
like bees to honey.

379
00:37:42,566 --> 00:37:44,134
- Got it.
- Don't worry.

380
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:46,003
There are no Reapers here.

381
00:37:46,036 --> 00:37:48,171
But don't start firing guns
for no reason.

382
00:37:48,204 --> 00:37:49,573
Loser Astronomer.

383
00:37:49,606 --> 00:37:50,841
We more likely
to die of boredom

384
00:37:50,874 --> 00:37:52,910
than from any Reapers.

385
00:37:53,143 --> 00:37:55,045
Ok, enough fucking around,
bitches!

386
00:37:55,178 --> 00:37:57,581
I'm leading.
Tank, stay behind and cover me.

387
00:37:57,847 --> 00:38:00,651
Spirit, get over there
and distract them.

388
00:38:01,017 --> 00:38:02,218
Front and back.

389
00:38:02,252 --> 00:38:04,688
The rest of you bastards can
stay the fuck out of the way.

390
00:38:05,155 --> 00:38:07,591
Any questions?
No fucking way.

391
00:38:07,857 --> 00:38:09,527
Let's do this!

392
00:38:27,277 --> 00:38:28,211
Freeze!

393
00:39:01,077 --> 00:39:02,913
Did you work
in this factory?

394
00:39:02,946 --> 00:39:04,815
What is this frickin' place?

395
00:39:04,915 --> 00:39:06,049
A lot of factories
are mixed up in here.

396
00:39:06,082 --> 00:39:07,651
It's a combined
of different memories.

397
00:39:08,018 --> 00:39:09,186
There!

398
00:39:10,053 --> 00:39:11,088
That's the hangar!

399
00:39:11,121 --> 00:39:12,856
I can remember it now!

400
00:39:12,889 --> 00:39:14,825
We have to find
the secret door.

401
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:17,227
They just about finished
with their rounds.

402
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:19,863
We have 30 seconds
to get past them.

403
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:24,835
Not yet, Phantom!
Phantom!

404
00:39:56,766 --> 00:39:58,268
- Come on!
- I said freeze, motherfucker!

405
00:40:10,146 --> 00:40:12,082
Tank, throw a grenade!

406
00:40:12,115 --> 00:40:15,319
- It's too far, I won't make it!
- Goddamn it! Just throw it!

407
00:40:46,249 --> 00:40:47,418
Tank!

408
00:40:47,784 --> 00:40:49,186
Cover me!
Going up!

409
00:40:49,486 --> 00:40:50,721
Gotcha!

410
00:40:50,954 --> 00:40:52,890
You got to stay back, Tank!

411
00:41:42,071 --> 00:41:43,807
Whoo-hoo!

412
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:48,045
Get down!

413
00:41:55,451 --> 00:41:56,787
Spirit!

414
00:42:11,501 --> 00:42:12,936
Here...

415
00:42:38,027 --> 00:42:39,296
Huh. Ok.

416
00:43:00,984 --> 00:43:03,587
What the hell was that!
For Christ's fucking sake!

417
00:43:04,621 --> 00:43:06,256
Are you trying to get
us all killed!

418
00:43:08,358 --> 00:43:10,394
Why are you so nervous?

419
00:43:11,561 --> 00:43:15,499
- Calm down!
- We've called all the Reapers to this location!

420
00:43:16,432 --> 00:43:19,069
- Spirit?
- I don't perceive any of them yet.

421
00:43:23,573 --> 00:43:25,209
Listen...

422
00:43:25,975 --> 00:43:27,411
...I'm in charge here.

423
00:43:32,916 --> 00:43:35,585
If you ever scream
at me again,

424
00:43:35,618 --> 00:43:37,955
I will break you
limb by limb.

425
00:43:39,222 --> 00:43:41,925
I'm am the commander here!

426
00:43:43,259 --> 00:43:45,429
Do you share this opinion?

427
00:43:45,628 --> 00:43:47,598
I can't hear you!

428
00:43:52,602 --> 00:43:53,971
Hey!

429
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:55,305
I got it!

430
00:44:01,077 --> 00:44:02,145
Come here.

431
00:44:02,512 --> 00:44:04,147
You ok?

432
00:44:19,529 --> 00:44:22,399
That I really
can't remember.

433
00:44:27,737 --> 00:44:30,006
The explosives
in just one torpedo

434
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:31,642
would be enough
for a month.

435
00:44:32,342 --> 00:44:34,311
- Cable, get to it.
- Yeah.

436
00:44:34,978 --> 00:44:36,280
I'm on it!

437
00:44:43,586 --> 00:44:45,622
Come on, come on!
Come on!

438
00:44:46,022 --> 00:44:48,191
Easy, easy!
Easy!

439
00:44:49,592 --> 00:44:50,360
Easy.

440
00:44:50,393 --> 00:44:53,597
Slowly. Come on.
Come on, come on.

441
00:45:03,439 --> 00:45:05,309
Let me heal that.

442
00:45:06,376 --> 00:45:07,210
It's nothing.

443
00:45:07,243 --> 00:45:08,144
Come on.

444
00:45:08,178 --> 00:45:09,546
Let me take a look
at your hand as well.

445
00:45:10,246 --> 00:45:12,282
I just said it's nothing!

446
00:45:17,387 --> 00:45:19,056
Thanks.

447
00:45:20,189 --> 00:45:22,092
I said careful here!

448
00:45:22,192 --> 00:45:24,161
Careful, you blockhead!
Hold it tighter!

449
00:45:24,694 --> 00:45:27,197
One false move
and we're blown to bits

450
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,966
in a matter of seconds!

451
00:45:35,671 --> 00:45:37,374
Fucking Coma!

452
00:45:38,508 --> 00:45:42,112
I've seen this before.
The country I know...

453
00:45:42,612 --> 00:45:45,482
...but I can't remember
what it is.

454
00:45:56,526 --> 00:45:58,128
What's going on?

455
00:46:03,332 --> 00:46:06,336
Everything is strange here,
right?

456
00:46:08,271 --> 00:46:09,639
Like a dream.

457
00:46:10,807 --> 00:46:14,678
You should be able to feel
whats around you...

458
00:46:22,752 --> 00:46:25,455
- They're here!
- Don't say I didn't tell you.

459
00:46:27,757 --> 00:46:29,026
How far?

460
00:46:30,126 --> 00:46:33,063
- Around 500 meters!
- Get it down!

461
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,432
No can do!

462
00:46:35,698 --> 00:46:37,734
I need a minute here,
at least!

463
00:46:37,834 --> 00:46:40,370
- Down! Both of you!
- I need another minute!

464
00:46:40,403 --> 00:46:41,738
Commander, my ass!

465
00:46:42,271 --> 00:46:44,541
I'll finish it myself.

466
00:46:58,788 --> 00:47:00,423
He won't make it.

467
00:47:00,456 --> 00:47:02,492
Now what?
I hope you're happy.

468
00:47:09,765 --> 00:47:12,602
Hold it for as long as
you can, buddy. Got it?

469
00:47:15,905 --> 00:47:18,308
Gnome stays here,
the rest follow me!

470
00:47:18,508 --> 00:47:21,611
- No way he can get it down by himself!
- What about Cable?

471
00:47:21,644 --> 00:47:24,180
No discussions,
obey the fucking order!

472
00:47:24,213 --> 00:47:26,683
On three. One, two,

473
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:29,453
three. Now move!

474
00:47:38,728 --> 00:47:41,331
Stop!
Get back here and hold this!

475
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:51,608
Jesus Christ,
we can't hold this!

476
00:47:52,408 --> 00:47:53,643
I said, move!

477
00:47:55,378 --> 00:47:56,446
Come back here!

478
00:47:57,346 --> 00:47:58,782
- Come on!
- Get back!

479
00:48:04,287 --> 00:48:06,289
Everyone get back!

480
00:48:22,805 --> 00:48:24,207
You little piece of--

481
00:48:24,941 --> 00:48:26,910
Don't you dare!

482
00:48:53,569 --> 00:48:55,172
Get this to the exit.

483
00:48:56,305 --> 00:48:57,574
Move it!

484
00:49:27,336 --> 00:49:31,341
I look up
and while you guys are running,

485
00:49:31,374 --> 00:49:33,443
the stupid thing starts sliding
down, dragging me with it.

486
00:49:33,476 --> 00:49:37,313
And as I'm riding it,
I'm thinking, "This is it."

487
00:49:37,346 --> 00:49:40,951
But then the sparks,
this ramp... Kaboom!

488
00:49:41,484 --> 00:49:45,822
My first thought,
"I'm dead, it exploded."

489
00:49:45,922 --> 00:49:47,757
Rest in piece, Cable.

490
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:50,326
Who knows what the hell
dying in Coma is like?

491
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:52,262
Architect, you fool!

492
00:49:52,295 --> 00:49:54,297
Why didn't you run
with the rest of the squad?

493
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:56,266
It was an order
for Christ's sake!

494
00:49:58,534 --> 00:50:00,470
That gives me an idea...

495
00:50:12,548 --> 00:50:14,350
Could you build a wall,
if needed,

496
00:50:14,383 --> 00:50:16,486
if we're in combat, fighting?

497
00:50:17,553 --> 00:50:18,822
Yeah.

498
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:23,393
Maybe a bridge
or something like that?

499
00:50:26,896 --> 00:50:28,732
Maybe a bridge, I guess.
Yeah.

500
00:50:34,503 --> 00:50:36,873
Attaboy!

501
00:50:38,474 --> 00:50:40,777
That'll be useful to us,
Architect.

502
00:50:42,845 --> 00:50:46,283
We can go to fucking places
we never dared to go before.

503
00:50:46,882 --> 00:50:48,351
And I'm thinking...

504
00:50:49,352 --> 00:50:50,887
...there's a better way
for us to make use

505
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,889
of this special talent of his.

506
00:50:56,492 --> 00:50:57,860
For a long time, we were
trying to find a place

507
00:50:57,893 --> 00:51:00,430
to hide from the Reapers.

508
00:51:00,463 --> 00:51:01,898
Some place isolated.

509
00:51:02,131 --> 00:51:03,933
But it's difficult,

510
00:51:03,966 --> 00:51:06,069
because we remember
not only the place,

511
00:51:06,102 --> 00:51:08,705
but the path that leads us
to the place as well.

512
00:51:09,572 --> 00:51:11,474
Isn't that right,
Astronomer?

513
00:51:12,108 --> 00:51:14,944
But what if the place
wasn't built

514
00:51:14,977 --> 00:51:16,813
using our memories,

515
00:51:16,846 --> 00:51:18,715
but our imagination.

516
00:51:18,815 --> 00:51:22,552
What if we started
from scratch, no memories.

517
00:51:22,585 --> 00:51:23,720
What if we designed
an island

518
00:51:23,753 --> 00:51:25,521
that was never seen before.

519
00:51:25,554 --> 00:51:28,591
A place that wasn't
attached to any memories.

520
00:51:28,924 --> 00:51:30,994
That would make is safe,
wouldn't it?

521
00:51:32,962 --> 00:51:35,498
I told you that I...

522
00:51:35,531 --> 00:51:37,600
...would lead you all to
a safe place.

523
00:51:37,633 --> 00:51:39,869
And here's the man
who will build it for us.

524
00:51:46,675 --> 00:51:49,579
You mean really?
A whole frickin' island?

525
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,049
You in?

526
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,463
I can do it.

527
00:52:09,698 --> 00:52:12,435
The best time for us to
head out would be right now.

528
00:52:14,437 --> 00:52:16,773
Hey Yan, shouldn't me and you
discuss that first?

529
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,744
- We need time to prepare for this.
- What do you think, Astronomer?

530
00:52:23,045 --> 00:52:26,516
If we're going to be leaving,
all of us as one big group,

531
00:52:26,549 --> 00:52:27,950
it means we're
going to need a route

532
00:52:27,983 --> 00:52:30,453
that's absolutely safe
from Reapers.

533
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:33,757
- Like we haven't had in a while.
- That's so theoretical.

534
00:52:34,056 --> 00:52:36,426
- It's all bullshit, Yan.
- Consider this,

535
00:52:36,459 --> 00:52:38,995
are explosives supply
is running real low.

536
00:52:39,462 --> 00:52:42,031
What are chances of surviving
here when we're out?

537
00:52:42,665 --> 00:52:44,700
Sooner or later Reapers
will see us entering

538
00:52:44,733 --> 00:52:46,035
or leaving the bus.

539
00:52:46,068 --> 00:52:47,504
And then what?

540
00:52:47,604 --> 00:52:49,005
We leave tomorrow.

541
00:52:50,706 --> 00:52:52,842
I want you
to be squad leader.

542
00:52:59,114 --> 00:53:00,249
Yan...

543
00:53:00,282 --> 00:53:04,654
Yan, I might've overstepped
my boundaries today, but--

544
00:53:04,687 --> 00:53:06,856
You were reckless
and brought on the Reapers.

545
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:09,459
You endangered
the whole squad.

546
00:53:09,492 --> 00:53:11,828
This is not what we
agreed upon.

547
00:53:12,228 --> 00:53:13,830
It's my place to lead.

548
00:53:16,131 --> 00:53:18,568
This mission is way
too important.

549
00:53:19,635 --> 00:53:21,504
Important mission?

550
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,906
Well maybe they should hear
about some of the other things

551
00:53:23,939 --> 00:53:26,810
- we were talking about.
- Muzzle it, Phantom!

552
00:53:49,565 --> 00:53:51,968
Why aren't we partying, huh?

553
00:53:57,273 --> 00:54:01,010
Tomorrow is a big day.
Right, Architect?

554
00:54:43,018 --> 00:54:44,787
Shit!

555
00:54:45,187 --> 00:54:46,923
What are you doing?

556
00:54:47,023 --> 00:54:48,724
Ooh, you scared me.

557
00:54:48,757 --> 00:54:49,926
I'm just messing around.

558
00:54:52,861 --> 00:54:54,797
You're building what?

559
00:54:55,898 --> 00:54:57,634
Well I'm trying.

560
00:54:59,234 --> 00:55:01,037
Can I watch?

561
00:55:01,137 --> 00:55:03,172
I'm almost done, actually.

562
00:55:07,176 --> 00:55:08,778
It looks like
it doesn't work.

563
00:55:10,279 --> 00:55:12,115
No, no problem.

564
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:16,252
And how come
you told everyone

565
00:55:16,285 --> 00:55:18,321
you were going to build
that island for us?

566
00:55:24,193 --> 00:55:25,928
At the submarine you were
yelling for everyone

567
00:55:25,961 --> 00:55:27,096
to get back.

568
00:55:27,129 --> 00:55:29,632
You were afraid the whole
thing could maybe collapsed.

569
00:55:30,699 --> 00:55:31,968
You would've killed us.

570
00:55:32,001 --> 00:55:33,570
I'm done here.

571
00:55:34,036 --> 00:55:36,105
But wait,
you made it work.

572
00:55:36,138 --> 00:55:37,673
You made it this far
without me...

573
00:55:37,706 --> 00:55:39,709
Just figure out
what went wrong.

574
00:55:39,742 --> 00:55:41,811
Hey, wait a sec!
You were concentrating.

575
00:55:41,844 --> 00:55:43,980
Did something with your
hands and something appeared.

576
00:55:44,013 --> 00:55:45,181
Yes and the ramp appeared.

577
00:55:45,214 --> 00:55:46,816
What's the point
of discussing it right now?

578
00:55:46,849 --> 00:55:49,085
No, a blueprint appeared.

579
00:55:59,428 --> 00:56:01,731
Appeared...

580
00:56:01,764 --> 00:56:03,833
The blueprint appeared...

581
00:56:07,036 --> 00:56:10,306
Yeah, I need to imagine
the entire construction map.

582
00:56:11,173 --> 00:56:12,875
The 3D layout...

583
00:56:42,271 --> 00:56:43,439
What kind of house do you
want me to build for you

584
00:56:43,472 --> 00:56:44,974
on my island?

585
00:57:15,971 --> 00:57:19,008
They say you have a room
full of memories.

586
00:57:19,908 --> 00:57:21,210
That's right.

587
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:23,780
I'd be interested
in taking a look.

588
00:57:28,317 --> 00:57:29,352
Wow!

589
00:57:29,385 --> 00:57:33,222
You have so many.
I only have a few in my room.

590
00:57:33,989 --> 00:57:35,891
Does that mean you don't
remember anything?

591
00:57:35,924 --> 00:57:37,827
No, just feelings.

592
00:57:38,527 --> 00:57:39,662
Was this an accident
you were in?

593
00:57:39,695 --> 00:57:42,699
Yeah, I was being driven
to a meeting with a client,

594
00:57:43,966 --> 00:57:46,069
but it turned out
it was kinda a trap.

595
00:57:46,502 --> 00:57:48,037
A trap for an architect?

596
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:50,173
Yeah, I hear you,
it sounds bizarre.

597
00:57:53,809 --> 00:57:56,112
And this woman?
Were you close?

598
00:57:56,145 --> 00:57:56,813
I'm not sure,

599
00:57:56,846 --> 00:57:58,247
and it's not really important,

600
00:57:58,281 --> 00:58:01,984
- because my life is here now.
- But you wanted to wake up so bad.

601
00:58:02,017 --> 00:58:05,221
Yeah, yeah, I know.
But...

602
00:58:07,389 --> 00:58:11,093
Yeah, it was like I met you here
and for the first time

603
00:58:11,126 --> 00:58:13,028
I can be who
I really want to be.

604
00:58:13,061 --> 00:58:13,963
Like Yan said.

605
00:58:13,996 --> 00:58:15,030
If we don't remember anything,

606
00:58:15,063 --> 00:58:16,999
we can start a life
all over again.

607
00:58:17,866 --> 00:58:19,135
And become the person,

608
00:58:19,168 --> 00:58:22,838
you know, the individual
that we always aspire to.

609
00:58:22,871 --> 00:58:24,874
- I'm talking nonsense, huh?
- No.

610
00:58:29,144 --> 00:58:30,780
I have that feeling, too.

611
00:58:30,913 --> 00:58:32,815
Then you can
remember something.

612
00:58:35,484 --> 00:58:37,086
Memories.

613
00:58:39,021 --> 00:58:40,256
I remember I couldn't
be together

614
00:58:40,289 --> 00:58:41,958
with the one
I wanted to be.

615
00:58:44,092 --> 00:58:45,428
Here it's possible.

616
00:59:33,041 --> 00:59:34,176
During the trek,

617
00:59:34,209 --> 00:59:36,345
you're gonna have
to follow orders.

618
00:59:37,045 --> 00:59:39,482
Make sure you stay in line,
but keep your distance.

619
00:59:39,582 --> 00:59:42,852
- Can we carry guns?
- No, we won't be needing them.

620
00:59:42,885 --> 00:59:45,388
There are no Reapers
on the route we're taking.

621
00:59:45,988 --> 00:59:47,824
Here is where we want
to build the island.

622
00:59:48,257 --> 00:59:50,359
We approach from behind
these hills here.

623
00:59:50,959 --> 00:59:52,895
They won't even notice us.

624
00:59:53,195 --> 00:59:54,964
What if you missed
the route?

625
00:59:55,097 --> 00:59:56,599
I know them like
the back of my hand.

626
00:59:56,632 --> 00:59:59,268
The dangerous parts have been
cleared and double checked.

627
00:59:59,301 --> 01:00:02,238
Seems about right.
I would sense them...

628
01:00:02,971 --> 01:00:04,473
...and I'm not sensing them.

629
01:00:04,506 --> 01:00:05,875
Hey Phantom, listen up.

630
01:00:06,942 --> 01:00:09,178
Fuse wires. Should I pack them?
Are we need them?

631
01:00:10,245 --> 01:00:11,914
Why don't you ask
the Astronomer.

632
01:00:11,947 --> 01:00:13,449
He's the one
leading the squad.

633
01:00:13,482 --> 01:00:14,851
Alright.

634
01:01:37,432 --> 01:01:40,235
Um, uh, I have got a minor
kind of question.

635
01:01:40,268 --> 01:01:43,172
Which is, what am I supposed
to build on this island?

636
01:01:43,705 --> 01:01:46,041
- You're the architect, you can decide.
- Well there is one project,

637
01:01:46,074 --> 01:01:47,276
although it's not
technically mine,

638
01:01:47,309 --> 01:01:49,278
the client might be
against me sharing it.

639
01:01:50,112 --> 01:01:51,213
In your position,

640
01:01:51,247 --> 01:01:54,083
I think you can call the client
and say, "kiss my ass."

641
01:01:54,116 --> 01:01:56,051
I don't know anything
about your project.

642
01:01:56,084 --> 01:01:59,021
but let me tell you though,
I would like my own workshop.

643
01:01:59,054 --> 01:02:03,192
- With a lot of power tools and a case of beer.
- Aw, can I have a jacuzzi?

644
01:02:03,225 --> 01:02:06,362
- I want a weight room!
- Whoa, guys, whoa! Too many requests!

645
01:02:06,395 --> 01:02:07,730
One at a time now.

646
01:02:09,731 --> 01:02:11,200
They're here!

647
01:02:24,279 --> 01:02:26,382
No, that's impossible.

648
01:02:26,415 --> 01:02:28,284
The maps are up to date.
Are you sure?

649
01:02:28,517 --> 01:02:31,153
- I say what I sense.
- Shit!

650
01:02:31,186 --> 01:02:33,289
That's the Reapers for you.

651
01:02:34,456 --> 01:02:36,592
With so many people
and so much equipment,

652
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:38,361
we can't move very quickly!

653
01:02:39,161 --> 01:02:40,696
Should we head back?

654
01:02:43,131 --> 01:02:45,200
We won't have an opportunity
to get there for a while,

655
01:02:45,233 --> 01:02:46,569
I'd say it's up to you.

656
01:02:50,272 --> 01:02:51,707
Phantom.

657
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:55,044
You're more experienced than I.
What do you think?

658
01:02:56,611 --> 01:02:57,712
We're going to need
another path there,

659
01:02:57,746 --> 01:03:00,082
so probably we should split up,
do some reconnaissance

660
01:03:00,115 --> 01:03:01,484
and then meet back here.

661
01:03:03,151 --> 01:03:04,119
Makes sense.

662
01:03:04,152 --> 01:03:06,555
Two of us should stay,
to look after everyone.

663
01:03:06,588 --> 01:03:08,257
I'll stay here
with the Architect.

664
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:10,426
The Architect is not
going to be able to help you.

665
01:03:10,826 --> 01:03:13,295
He doesn't know how to shoot,
has zero experience.

666
01:03:13,328 --> 01:03:14,663
Tank would be better.

667
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:17,232
- Or I'll stay if you like.
- No.

668
01:03:17,265 --> 01:03:18,801
Nothing will happen to him!

669
01:03:19,167 --> 01:03:21,170
Just a bit of scouting,
here we have civilians.

670
01:03:21,203 --> 01:03:22,438
I said no!

671
01:03:22,471 --> 01:03:25,274
Count me in.
I'll be fine.

672
01:03:27,109 --> 01:03:28,444
Tank stays here.

673
01:03:28,477 --> 01:03:31,113
Architect,
go to the top of that hill.

674
01:03:31,146 --> 01:03:33,416
When you see the airplane,
you come right back. Got it?

675
01:03:33,849 --> 01:03:36,519
The rest of you spread out
in different directions.

676
01:05:08,643 --> 01:05:10,346
Tank, what are you
doing here?

677
01:05:10,946 --> 01:05:13,749
We gotta move quickly.
Yan sent me for you.

678
01:05:17,452 --> 01:05:18,721
Watch out!

679
01:05:29,798 --> 01:05:33,268
Reapers!
About 300 meters!

680
01:05:33,301 --> 01:05:34,503
We gotta head out!

681
01:05:38,807 --> 01:05:39,641
- Give me that!
- What...

682
01:05:39,675 --> 01:05:41,310
- What are you doing?
- Give me that!

683
01:05:43,378 --> 01:05:44,813
- I said give me that!
- What the hell is this?

684
01:05:46,681 --> 01:05:47,950
Let him fucking go!

685
01:05:50,919 --> 01:05:52,721
Where did you get it?

686
01:05:53,555 --> 01:05:56,458
- You fucking planted it!
- You set us all up to die!

687
01:06:00,829 --> 01:06:04,200
I didn't want to.
We need to leave.

688
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,203
Hey, I know what
you're thinking.

689
01:06:08,603 --> 01:06:10,339
You don't know
what's happening here.

690
01:06:10,372 --> 01:06:13,542
I'm not the one who... who
put is here in the first place.

691
01:06:13,742 --> 01:06:15,844
It was...
it was him all along.

692
01:06:26,354 --> 01:06:27,856
We need to leave.

693
01:06:27,889 --> 01:06:29,958
We need to be leaving
here right away.

694
01:06:29,991 --> 01:06:32,828
Reapers!
Reapers!

695
01:06:34,429 --> 01:06:36,699
Astronomer!
Get everyone to safety!

696
01:06:37,732 --> 01:06:41,670
Right, listen up everyone!
Get rid of the heavy gear!

697
01:06:46,775 --> 01:06:47,576
Cable!

698
01:07:13,902 --> 01:07:15,837
Architect, to the bus!
Hurry!

699
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:16,905
Tank, take him!

700
01:08:01,416 --> 01:08:02,685
Hey.

701
01:08:04,919 --> 01:08:06,689
Hey!

702
01:08:07,055 --> 01:08:08,857
Hey!

703
01:08:09,624 --> 01:08:11,060
Hey!

704
01:08:23,905 --> 01:08:25,707
The Reaper whistle
drew them here.

705
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:27,009
Behind us!

706
01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:29,345
This is it, buddies.

707
01:08:30,078 --> 01:08:31,680
That way!

708
01:08:40,989 --> 01:08:42,758
Let's go!

709
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:10,979
We're almost there.

710
01:10:11,112 --> 01:10:13,515
- Have they given you any money yet?
- Forget about money.

711
01:10:13,548 --> 01:10:14,549
Unlike the other idiots
out there,

712
01:10:14,582 --> 01:10:15,416
they're interested
in a project

713
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:16,751
and my ideas will bring
something new.

714
01:10:16,784 --> 01:10:18,253
This is a big chance for me!

715
01:10:18,286 --> 01:10:19,788
Come on, just because
they told you were cool,

716
01:10:19,821 --> 01:10:21,623
and how great
your project is.

717
01:10:22,257 --> 01:10:23,959
Have you lost your mind
or what?

718
01:10:23,992 --> 01:10:25,126
Are you that gullible?

719
01:10:25,159 --> 01:10:27,229
This isn't any old client,
it's a sect.

720
01:10:27,262 --> 01:10:29,130
It's like,
all over the news.

721
01:10:29,163 --> 01:10:31,166
They're probably using you.

722
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:32,534
Who know's what
they're planning to do

723
01:10:32,567 --> 01:10:33,702
with all your ideas.

724
01:10:36,771 --> 01:10:39,741
The Teacher loves you
and all of his followers.

725
01:10:40,608 --> 01:10:42,544
The Teacher sets you free!
Follow his calling.

726
01:10:44,312 --> 01:10:47,048
- Read what the Teacher says about you!
- Holy shit!

727
01:10:47,081 --> 01:10:49,184
A path to a new life
will open up to you!

728
01:10:49,217 --> 01:10:50,953
The Teacher sets you free!

729
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:53,989
The Teacher loves you.

730
01:10:56,958 --> 01:10:58,694
The Teacher sets you free.

731
01:11:00,061 --> 01:11:02,030
- Is that him?
- How do I know!

732
01:11:02,564 --> 01:11:03,532
You don't know
what he looks like?

733
01:11:03,565 --> 01:11:05,968
We just wrote to each other,
that's it, ok!

734
01:11:06,935 --> 01:11:08,203
Uh...

735
01:11:08,236 --> 01:11:10,805
We were told
you'd be arriving alone.

736
01:11:10,838 --> 01:11:12,841
- Yeah, but he's not alone!
- Can you please calm down.

737
01:11:12,941 --> 01:11:15,076
We can only let you in
on your own.

738
01:11:15,109 --> 01:11:17,079
My really sorry,
we have strict rules.

739
01:11:17,612 --> 01:11:20,282
- You're the one I should see?
- No, of course not.

740
01:11:20,915 --> 01:11:23,051
Why don't you think of me
as a disciple.

741
01:11:24,619 --> 01:11:27,055
I was the person who
sent you the letter though.

742
01:11:27,288 --> 01:11:29,658
Our Teacher awaits
your presence inside.

743
01:11:30,992 --> 01:11:31,860
- Please don't--
- You gotta be kidding me.

744
01:11:31,893 --> 01:11:33,729
You need to stay
in the car and wait.

745
01:11:33,962 --> 01:11:35,630
- Hold on.
- What?

746
01:11:35,663 --> 01:11:37,232
Here, I want you
to have this.

747
01:11:47,241 --> 01:11:50,011
So... what is this place?
A hospital?

748
01:11:50,044 --> 01:11:52,714
It used to be.
Until we took it over.

749
01:11:57,685 --> 01:11:59,187
Follow me, please.

750
01:12:25,146 --> 01:12:27,616
Brilliant. How long have
you had these plans?

751
01:12:27,649 --> 01:12:29,618
Um...
since I was a student.

752
01:12:29,651 --> 01:12:33,221
And yet people continue
building these ugly boxes.

753
01:12:33,254 --> 01:12:34,356
Yeah, yeah,
you're absolutely right,

754
01:12:34,389 --> 01:12:35,624
it makes no sense to me.

755
01:12:35,657 --> 01:12:36,558
I've submitted them all over

756
01:12:36,592 --> 01:12:37,892
and no one out there
is even interested.

757
01:12:37,925 --> 01:12:39,928
Yeah.
You're absolutely right.

758
01:12:39,961 --> 01:12:41,229
I've submitted them all over

759
01:12:41,263 --> 01:12:43,965
and the world will never be able
to recognize something inspired

760
01:12:43,998 --> 01:12:47,169
even if it was...
...was a 100 times better.

761
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:51,340
Would you really be able
to build what I'm proposing?

762
01:12:51,973 --> 01:12:52,741
Hmm.

763
01:12:53,475 --> 01:12:55,143
Allow me to show
you something.

764
01:13:04,252 --> 01:13:06,721
Uh... excuse me,

765
01:13:06,754 --> 01:13:09,925
what exactly does your
organization do?

766
01:13:11,025 --> 01:13:13,328
You know, there's a lot
of rumors out there.

767
01:13:14,896 --> 01:13:16,431
We give people
the gift of a new life.

768
01:13:16,464 --> 01:13:18,266
Like it says
on the billboard.

769
01:13:21,302 --> 01:13:23,138
You'll see everything
for yourself.

770
01:13:33,781 --> 01:13:35,884
While studying the cerebral
physiology of the brain,

771
01:13:35,917 --> 01:13:37,886
I discovered that in a state
of a deep coma,

772
01:13:37,919 --> 01:13:39,287
we have access
to a variable world

773
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:40,955
no one knows about.

774
01:13:40,988 --> 01:13:42,924
And I swear to you on
the soul of my mother

775
01:13:42,957 --> 01:13:46,662
that this world is better
than consensus reality.

776
01:13:46,762 --> 01:13:48,363
What do you mean, dreams?

777
01:13:48,896 --> 01:13:50,098
It's impossible to explain.

778
01:13:50,131 --> 01:13:51,166
Would you like to
try it out now?

779
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:53,902
Uh, I'm in a hurry,
I've got to be somewhere.

780
01:13:54,002 --> 01:13:55,270
It won't take
but a minute.

781
01:13:56,938 --> 01:13:58,240
I'm sure you'll like it!

782
01:14:00,808 --> 01:14:02,778
Get back!
Both of you!

783
01:14:18,259 --> 01:14:19,093
What's going on?

784
01:14:19,127 --> 01:14:20,862
- What happened?
- Come on! Go! Go! Go!

785
01:14:22,831 --> 01:14:24,499
I just ran a person over!

786
01:14:24,532 --> 01:14:26,735
- Go! Go! Go!
- I told you they were lying,

787
01:14:26,768 --> 01:14:28,203
but you can never listen!

788
01:14:28,236 --> 01:14:30,271
Why can't you ever listen
to anyone--

789
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:11,780
That's right.
She was put in a coma

790
01:15:11,813 --> 01:15:13,849
just a couple of hours
before you.

791
01:15:14,382 --> 01:15:16,785
But there,
months have passed.

792
01:15:16,885 --> 01:15:18,487
Extraordinary, isn't it?

793
01:15:18,953 --> 01:15:20,922
Who the hell are you?

794
01:15:21,522 --> 01:15:24,526
A group of scientists
that want to give

795
01:15:24,559 --> 01:15:26,194
a new world to people.

796
01:15:27,428 --> 01:15:29,331
And that spiritual teaching?

797
01:15:29,597 --> 01:15:32,100
It helps to finance
the project.

798
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,069
My research was considered
lacking in perspective

799
01:15:35,102 --> 01:15:37,839
so I had to find a way
to finance the whole thing.

800
01:15:37,872 --> 01:15:39,274
And as a wise man
once said,

801
01:15:39,307 --> 01:15:42,577
"If you want to get rich,
create your own religion."

802
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:44,112
And in truth,
it was a lot easier

803
01:15:44,145 --> 01:15:45,547
than I thought it would be.

804
01:15:46,981 --> 01:15:49,985
- Was your promise to build a city of mine a lie?
- Of course not.

805
01:15:51,085 --> 01:15:52,788
The plans are real.

806
01:15:53,921 --> 01:15:56,591
I've put together
a group of people

807
01:15:56,624 --> 01:15:58,893
that have specific brain
pathologies,

808
01:15:58,926 --> 01:15:59,961
that are unique to them

809
01:15:59,994 --> 01:16:01,930
so they could survive
in a coma.

810
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:05,400
And I found an artist
with a singular memory

811
01:16:05,433 --> 01:16:08,970
and an amazing imagination
for a project,

812
01:16:09,003 --> 01:16:10,371
that would mean
realizing his dreams.

813
01:16:10,404 --> 01:16:11,873
What for?

814
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:15,210
It's obvious.
To live there happily.

815
01:16:15,443 --> 01:16:17,112
A fantasy world?

816
01:16:18,546 --> 01:16:20,181
Mankind has know for ages

817
01:16:20,214 --> 01:16:22,350
that there are other
worlds out there.

818
01:16:23,217 --> 01:16:26,588
Coma was visited
by many Ancient rulers

819
01:16:26,621 --> 01:16:28,056
of many cultures.

820
01:16:28,089 --> 01:16:30,291
But the truth is,
modern medicine

821
01:16:30,324 --> 01:16:33,862
has filled this world
with corpses, they're Reapers.

822
01:16:33,962 --> 01:16:35,396
And all these souls
that should be dead

823
01:16:35,429 --> 01:16:37,031
suddenly found
a reason to live.

824
01:16:37,064 --> 01:16:39,301
You were happy there
yourself, right?

825
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,003
You're a successful
architect there.

826
01:16:42,036 --> 01:16:44,172
What are you going
to build here,

827
01:16:44,205 --> 01:16:46,107
a set of row houses?

828
01:16:46,607 --> 01:16:48,376
If you ever get lucky.

829
01:16:50,144 --> 01:16:52,380
Did you give them
the same shots as me?

830
01:16:52,413 --> 01:16:54,549
A more robust one,
that works faster.

831
01:16:54,582 --> 01:16:56,585
Maybe you should have
asked them first!

832
01:16:59,553 --> 01:17:02,858
You know, Phantom fully
recovered his memory.

833
01:17:03,457 --> 01:17:05,927
He remembered
how he got here

834
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:08,196
and who he was.

835
01:17:09,664 --> 01:17:11,166
But he didn't want
to wake up.

836
01:17:12,233 --> 01:17:13,635
But then a Reaper
got to him.

837
01:17:13,668 --> 01:17:15,169
Which physiological speaking

838
01:17:15,202 --> 01:17:17,873
initiated a necrosis
of brain tissue.

839
01:17:18,272 --> 01:17:19,240
He panicked,

840
01:17:19,273 --> 01:17:21,610
threaten he would reveal
the truth to everyone.

841
01:17:22,209 --> 01:17:23,678
But in the end he killed
a bunch of people

842
01:17:23,711 --> 01:17:25,613
and almost spoiled
everything.

843
01:17:25,646 --> 01:17:27,282
I barely got you
out of there.

844
01:17:27,548 --> 01:17:29,450
So if you could
remain ignorant,

845
01:17:29,483 --> 01:17:31,987
that'll solve your problems.

846
01:17:34,155 --> 01:17:36,090
And... all the people
out there, your followers,

847
01:17:36,123 --> 01:17:37,992
you're gonna take them
with you to Coma as well?

848
01:17:38,025 --> 01:17:39,661
Well someone's
got to support life.

849
01:17:39,694 --> 01:17:40,695
Slaves.

850
01:17:41,228 --> 01:17:44,900
But do they know that they
will be put into a coma?

851
01:17:45,366 --> 01:17:48,369
In return I give people an
infinite life full of meaning.

852
01:17:48,402 --> 01:17:49,671
What's wrong with that?

853
01:17:50,104 --> 01:17:52,407
Everyone gets what
they want in Coma.

854
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:55,543
One person is a commander
or spiritual leader,

855
01:17:55,576 --> 01:17:57,645
and another person needs
to be a great architect.

856
01:17:57,678 --> 01:17:59,447
You're fucking demented, man!

857
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:01,249
It's a dream world.
Are you aware of that?

858
01:18:01,282 --> 01:18:03,117
Oh, good God.
That's not important.

859
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:04,085
That's it,
I'm out of here.

860
01:18:04,118 --> 01:18:05,653
This is...
Please, let me go.

861
01:18:05,686 --> 01:18:07,155
Let us all go.

862
01:18:10,424 --> 01:18:12,460
Knowledge is the source
of all problems.

863
01:18:16,764 --> 01:18:19,200
I'm going to need you to
finish that project for me.

864
01:18:19,734 --> 01:18:22,103
I am not going back there.

865
01:18:24,739 --> 01:18:27,375
You know, when a person's
been touched by a Reaper,

866
01:18:28,609 --> 01:18:32,213
within a couple of minutes,
their brain is dead.

867
01:18:32,446 --> 01:18:34,382
Where did you leave her
in a field?

868
01:18:35,082 --> 01:18:37,719
That's strange,
but it's pretty normal.

869
01:18:38,486 --> 01:18:41,556
- Well you know, sometimes the necrosis is reversible.
- Shut up!

870
01:18:42,623 --> 01:18:44,659
Let her go!
She's not a part of this!

871
01:18:44,692 --> 01:18:45,693
I wanted you
to come alone.

872
01:18:45,727 --> 01:18:47,996
You're the one who started
the road race here.

873
01:18:48,029 --> 01:18:50,332
I'd say you're responsible
for all of this.

874
01:18:51,399 --> 01:18:54,435
Get the island and the city
on top of it completed

875
01:18:54,468 --> 01:18:56,304
and then I will let
both of you go.

876
01:18:56,337 --> 01:18:58,406
And you'll let
all of us go!

877
01:19:01,609 --> 01:19:03,011
You've got my word of honor,

878
01:19:03,044 --> 01:19:04,980
not to keep anyone
against their will.

879
01:19:25,566 --> 01:19:27,502
You will wake up
in your apartment.

880
01:19:28,669 --> 01:19:30,104
The brain is drawn
to the strongest

881
01:19:30,137 --> 01:19:32,073
and most powerful memories.

882
01:19:33,374 --> 01:19:35,076
And this time, you will find
that your memory

883
01:19:35,109 --> 01:19:36,578
will recover faster.

884
01:19:37,078 --> 01:19:39,014
You will find Astronomer.

885
01:19:39,213 --> 01:19:40,581
The coordinates of where
to build the city

886
01:19:40,614 --> 01:19:43,318
- are on his map.
- What if I don't make it there?

887
01:19:43,418 --> 01:19:44,452
You will.

888
01:19:44,685 --> 01:19:47,355
This stimulation
you just received

889
01:19:47,388 --> 01:19:49,424
will make your brain
work more intensely.

890
01:19:50,257 --> 01:19:52,060
It may damage your health,
in the long run,

891
01:19:52,626 --> 01:19:55,096
but you'll be like Superman
for a little while.

892
01:19:55,463 --> 01:19:57,398
Wait, hold on, how will they
know when it's time

893
01:19:57,431 --> 01:19:59,067
to get out of the coma?

894
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:00,402
Hard to say.

895
01:20:01,836 --> 01:20:04,672
There is a way.
From the inside.

896
01:20:05,339 --> 01:20:07,308
A back door of sorts.

897
01:20:07,575 --> 01:20:10,144
You do everything I ask
and I'll show it to you.

898
01:20:10,177 --> 01:20:11,178
Think about it.

899
01:20:11,212 --> 01:20:13,281
I made it back here
safe and sound, didn't I.

900
01:20:14,248 --> 01:20:15,150
Sleep.

901
01:21:34,828 --> 01:21:36,564
Get down!

902
01:21:43,938 --> 01:21:46,908
That's it.
We have one last grenade.

903
01:21:47,308 --> 01:21:49,644
Maybe we should use it
on ourselves?

904
01:22:15,636 --> 01:22:17,172
This world...

905
01:22:18,505 --> 01:22:20,274
...everything is not
what you thought it was,

906
01:22:20,307 --> 01:22:21,910
what we think is around us.

907
01:22:25,246 --> 01:22:26,748
Uh, so let's move out.

908
01:22:27,248 --> 01:22:28,816
We gotta move, peeps!

909
01:22:38,859 --> 01:22:41,295
A lot of people resist
in the beginning.

910
01:22:41,328 --> 01:22:43,631
Maybe you should
give him some more time.

911
01:22:45,766 --> 01:22:46,901
No.

912
01:22:48,602 --> 01:22:50,605
You'll do what
I told you to do.

913
01:23:10,891 --> 01:23:12,293
This is it.

914
01:23:13,027 --> 01:23:14,796
The place Yan chose.

915
01:23:16,930 --> 01:23:18,700
He said it was majestic.

916
01:23:21,735 --> 01:23:23,604
What's wrong?
You alright?

917
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:28,376
I'm ok.
I'm just a little tired.

918
01:23:29,777 --> 01:23:32,247
But once I'm on this island,
I'll be chill.

919
01:23:32,946 --> 01:23:34,716
We are almost there.

920
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:37,885
I was waiting for this.

921
01:23:39,653 --> 01:23:41,455
Yan ended up
being completely right.

922
01:23:41,488 --> 01:23:42,657
Don't you get it?

923
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:44,525
Can't you grasp that
we that we are laying

924
01:23:44,558 --> 01:23:45,926
in the basement
of that psychopath?

925
01:23:45,959 --> 01:23:47,728
There isn't any island
and there never will be.

926
01:23:47,761 --> 01:23:49,430
This is just a dream!

927
01:23:51,332 --> 01:23:52,900
Yo man, it's hard to believe,
I understand,

928
01:23:52,933 --> 01:23:54,468
but after you've seen it
with your own eyes,

929
01:23:54,501 --> 01:23:56,470
and everyone is like, frickin'
laying there, you just--

930
01:23:56,503 --> 01:23:58,840
So you told them after all.

931
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:00,875
They've been through
so much already.

932
01:24:01,942 --> 01:24:03,678
That's not really
fair of you.

933
01:24:05,412 --> 01:24:06,547
Where do you want it?

934
01:24:08,415 --> 01:24:10,751
The bridge should start
right here.

935
01:24:10,784 --> 01:24:12,053
Make it happen.

936
01:25:21,955 --> 01:25:25,025
"And God beheld
all that he had created,

937
01:25:25,058 --> 01:25:26,627
and it was very good."

938
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:28,990
What do you need reality
for after this?

939
01:26:34,027 --> 01:26:35,062
Yan, I've built
what you asked for.

940
01:26:35,095 --> 01:26:36,731
Now let us go.

941
01:26:44,638 --> 01:26:45,539
Spirit.

942
01:26:45,573 --> 01:26:48,108
In life you constantly saw
hallucinations.

943
01:26:48,141 --> 01:26:50,077
You were surrounded
by dead people.

944
01:26:51,178 --> 01:26:54,182
You had spasms and convulsions
almost every day of your life.

945
01:26:54,915 --> 01:26:56,951
You don't have family,
no one,

946
01:26:56,984 --> 01:26:58,853
and you lost
your only child.

947
01:26:58,886 --> 01:27:00,554
I rescued you
from the asylum,

948
01:27:00,587 --> 01:27:01,655
where you would have rotted

949
01:27:01,688 --> 01:27:03,591
till the last
of your dying days.

950
01:27:04,258 --> 01:27:05,593
Tank.

951
01:27:06,126 --> 01:27:08,729
You lost your family
in an accident.

952
01:27:09,530 --> 01:27:11,232
Blind drunk on rotgut.

953
01:27:11,265 --> 01:27:12,967
You tried to shoot
your neighbors.

954
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,702
You would have been
behind bars

955
01:27:14,735 --> 01:27:18,005
or locked up for the rest
of your life in a madhouse.

956
01:27:19,573 --> 01:27:21,843
Astronomer, in real life
you're autistic.

957
01:27:22,576 --> 01:27:24,045
You can't even leave
your house.

958
01:27:24,678 --> 01:27:26,481
Your poor old parents.

959
01:27:27,548 --> 01:27:30,485
What's going to happen to you
when they pass away, huh?

960
01:27:31,752 --> 01:27:35,623
And you have something worse
that's ailing you, Architect.

961
01:27:37,157 --> 01:27:40,861
Your ideas are beautiful,
just way ahead of their time,

962
01:27:40,894 --> 01:27:41,862
so no one wants them

963
01:27:41,895 --> 01:27:44,865
and everyone has abandoned you,
including her,

964
01:27:44,898 --> 01:27:47,268
and she was the last one
you drove away.

965
01:27:47,301 --> 01:27:48,970
There is nobody.

966
01:27:49,202 --> 01:27:51,772
Childish,
an unrecognized genius

967
01:27:51,805 --> 01:27:54,275
moody, with a chip
on his shoulder

968
01:27:54,708 --> 01:27:56,177
and the world is to blame.

969
01:27:58,812 --> 01:28:00,114
I'm sure you
contemplated suicide

970
01:28:00,147 --> 01:28:01,983
long before we contacted you.

971
01:28:05,285 --> 01:28:08,589
This project gave
meaning to your life.

972
01:28:15,996 --> 01:28:18,265
- Have they given you any money yet?
- Forget about money.

973
01:28:18,298 --> 01:28:20,234
Unlike other idiots out there,
they're interested in a project

974
01:28:20,267 --> 01:28:21,902
and my ideas
will bring something new!

975
01:28:21,935 --> 01:28:23,804
This is a big chance for me!

976
01:28:24,805 --> 01:28:25,840
Yeah, make fun of me.

977
01:28:25,873 --> 01:28:28,075
I swear everything will change
for us after this.

978
01:28:28,108 --> 01:28:30,344
- Huh? For us?
- Mm-hmm.

979
01:28:30,377 --> 01:28:31,412
There isn't any "us".

980
01:28:31,445 --> 01:28:33,314
Then why are you sitting
in this car with me now.

981
01:28:33,347 --> 01:28:34,682
Oh, please.
Fuck.

982
01:28:36,149 --> 01:28:38,185
C'mon, just because they
tell you how cool you are,

983
01:28:38,218 --> 01:28:39,553
and how great
your project is.

984
01:28:39,586 --> 01:28:43,157
- Have you lost your mind, or what?
- You used to believe in me.

985
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:46,694
They won't pay you
and they may even do--

986
01:28:46,927 --> 01:28:48,929
I don't know.
Something thats even worse.

987
01:28:48,962 --> 01:28:50,664
Your conscience
bothering you?

988
01:28:50,697 --> 01:28:51,932
Nice car you're driving.

989
01:28:51,965 --> 01:28:54,034
Is it a present
from your new lover...

990
01:28:54,067 --> 01:28:56,003
How else could you pay
for a car like this.

991
01:28:56,036 --> 01:28:57,004
But I promise you,

992
01:28:57,037 --> 01:28:59,774
when I'm famous,
you'll get a new one from me.

993
01:29:02,042 --> 01:29:04,078
I'm never
helping you again.

994
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:11,919
We want to remain here.

995
01:29:12,786 --> 01:29:14,655
I want to stay, too.

996
01:29:24,331 --> 01:29:26,634
I won't able
to let you stay.

997
01:29:33,874 --> 01:29:36,243
I'm sorry but you would
reveal everything.

998
01:29:40,747 --> 01:29:43,751
- Who's going to believe us?
- My followers will believe you.

999
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:46,086
C'mon, you can't hide it
forever. Now can you?

1000
01:29:46,119 --> 01:29:47,120
And in heaven,

1001
01:29:47,154 --> 01:29:49,723
there's no place for those
who know the secrets

1002
01:29:49,756 --> 01:29:51,292
of its creation.

1003
01:29:51,792 --> 01:29:53,628
This effects all of you.

1004
01:29:53,994 --> 01:29:55,262
Now that you know
the whole truth,

1005
01:29:55,295 --> 01:29:57,398
I can't let you live
among the others.

1006
01:29:58,131 --> 01:30:00,267
We promise
not to tell anyone.

1007
01:30:02,102 --> 01:30:03,771
The die is cast.

1008
01:30:08,909 --> 01:30:11,345
Cerebral hypoxy
has been induced.

1009
01:30:11,378 --> 01:30:13,914
Your brains will suffocate
for lack of oxygen

1010
01:30:14,247 --> 01:30:15,849
and you will all
feel it soon.

1011
01:30:23,290 --> 01:30:25,359
I don't know who's machine
was unplugged first,

1012
01:30:25,392 --> 01:30:27,127
but it's only a matter
of seconds.

1013
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:30,097
So here we have a little more
time to say out last goodbyes.

1014
01:30:30,130 --> 01:30:31,866
About fifteen minutes.

1015
01:30:35,969 --> 01:30:37,071
Wait!

1016
01:30:37,104 --> 01:30:37,838
Stay here!

1017
01:30:43,877 --> 01:30:46,013
Don't think I wasn't
expecting this.

1018
01:30:46,113 --> 01:30:48,182
Brain stimulation
can be tricky,

1019
01:30:48,215 --> 01:30:50,985
but I thought it was worth it,
in this case.

1020
01:30:52,018 --> 01:30:54,021
I'm on my way.
Adieu.

1021
01:31:17,110 --> 01:31:18,278
Damn!

1022
01:31:18,311 --> 01:31:21,248
You warned me about this,
that they would fuck me over.

1023
01:31:22,149 --> 01:31:24,251
- What?
- Wake up! We gotta wake ourselves.

1024
01:31:26,386 --> 01:31:28,288
We will wake up
and we will stop him.

1025
01:31:28,321 --> 01:31:29,857
The back door!

1026
01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:31,492
Astronomer!

1027
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:35,829
How did he mention escape
when the Reapers attacked?

1028
01:31:35,862 --> 01:31:37,031
Dreams.

1029
01:31:37,230 --> 01:31:39,366
We dream where we are
laying there, we all do.

1030
01:31:39,399 --> 01:31:40,968
Like right now.

1031
01:31:41,001 --> 01:31:42,836
So If you can find yourself
in a dream, then--

1032
01:31:42,869 --> 01:31:44,838
That's why he said that
they are dangerous! Dreams!

1033
01:31:44,871 --> 01:31:46,106
Why he said they're
fucking dangerous.

1034
01:31:46,139 --> 01:31:47,007
C'mon, lets go!

1035
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,175
- It's not that easy!
- C'mon, c'mon!

1036
01:31:48,208 --> 01:31:50,110
- We don't have much time, Astronomer!
- Spirit, let's go!

1037
01:31:50,143 --> 01:31:52,213
Let her be.
Let her be.

1038
01:32:48,235 --> 01:32:49,403
Astronomer, come on.
We need to get into the room.

1039
01:32:49,436 --> 01:32:50,905
We gotta move fast!

1040
01:32:52,072 --> 01:32:53,507
They made it before us.

1041
01:33:01,481 --> 01:33:03,117
- We can't get past him.
- Fuck!

1042
01:33:07,621 --> 01:33:09,156
I got an idea.

1043
01:33:25,505 --> 01:33:27,208
Come on! Come on!
Hurry!

1044
01:33:28,108 --> 01:33:29,343
Hurry!

1045
01:34:49,622 --> 01:34:52,960
- What?
- It's not how I remember it.

1046
01:34:52,993 --> 01:34:55,429
These are dreams,
I mentioned that already.

1047
01:34:56,196 --> 01:34:56,964
Everything is mixed up here.

1048
01:34:56,997 --> 01:34:59,199
Now concentrate
and find the room.

1049
01:35:01,234 --> 01:35:03,103
There, I think
I want to go there.

1050
01:36:09,102 --> 01:36:11,071
There was a door
and stairs.

1051
01:36:11,538 --> 01:36:13,173
It's not the same!

1052
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:15,509
Could you help me?

1053
01:36:16,109 --> 01:36:18,679
Everything is linked here
by association.

1054
01:36:19,145 --> 01:36:21,548
Maybe forget where rooms
are located for a minute.

1055
01:36:23,416 --> 01:36:24,785
How is that?

1056
01:36:24,818 --> 01:36:26,153
Detail!

1057
01:36:26,186 --> 01:36:27,654
You need details

1058
01:36:27,687 --> 01:36:30,190
that remind you of the room
and help you find it.

1059
01:36:30,223 --> 01:36:31,592
Details...

1060
01:36:49,876 --> 01:36:51,645
Yeah, here it is.

1061
01:36:52,579 --> 01:36:55,549
It was in a painting.
It was hanging in the room!

1062
01:36:55,649 --> 01:36:57,284
Bravo.

1063
01:36:57,584 --> 01:36:59,486
I... got it right.

1064
01:37:06,826 --> 01:37:08,429
Of course he got it right.

1065
01:37:08,795 --> 01:37:10,697
The Astronomer is a genius.

1066
01:37:10,730 --> 01:37:12,433
Where would we be
without him?

1067
01:37:13,133 --> 01:37:15,836
Our memory clings to what
we find most interesting.

1068
01:37:16,870 --> 01:37:18,839
And of all things,

1069
01:37:18,872 --> 01:37:21,241
you remembered a painting
with a temple.

1070
01:37:22,208 --> 01:37:23,610
A true architect.

1071
01:37:24,744 --> 01:37:26,213
You know,
I really hoped you'd be

1072
01:37:26,246 --> 01:37:28,182
a bit smarter than the rest.

1073
01:37:29,616 --> 01:37:32,285
You reminded me of myself
when I was young.

1074
01:37:35,622 --> 01:37:37,791
Modern medicine fights
to prolong a persons's life

1075
01:37:37,824 --> 01:37:39,660
for a few meager years.

1076
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:42,162
I was able to prolong it
for a thousand.

1077
01:37:42,195 --> 01:37:43,764
And you know what?

1078
01:37:43,897 --> 01:37:47,467
My own research department
lost it's financing

1079
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:50,771
in order to support studies
for a solution to cellulite.

1080
01:37:51,471 --> 01:37:54,141
And I never understood how to
live in a world so foolish,

1081
01:37:54,174 --> 01:37:55,109
so petty.

1082
01:37:55,142 --> 01:37:57,744
But then I realized
there is another world.

1083
01:37:58,811 --> 01:38:00,681
I'm a god there.

1084
01:38:06,819 --> 01:38:08,255
Watch out!

1085
01:38:10,657 --> 01:38:11,425
Fly, run!

1086
01:38:11,458 --> 01:38:13,627
I was a doubting Thomas
as well,

1087
01:38:13,660 --> 01:38:15,829
afraid it was just
a mere illusion.

1088
01:38:16,429 --> 01:38:18,899
But then,
I made a discovery.

1089
01:38:19,799 --> 01:38:22,769
Everything that we live for,
all of our emotions

1090
01:38:22,802 --> 01:38:27,908
like joy, anger, sorrow,
surprise, happiness,

1091
01:38:27,941 --> 01:38:31,145
are nothing more than
electrical signals in our brain.

1092
01:38:31,911 --> 01:38:35,282
We measured them on people
in a coma and in real world,

1093
01:38:35,315 --> 01:38:36,483
and you know what?

1094
01:38:36,516 --> 01:38:39,319
They are absolutely identical.

1095
01:38:40,453 --> 01:38:43,457
The life in Coma
is as real as it gets.

1096
01:38:46,226 --> 01:38:48,562
End of story.
Simple as that.

1097
01:40:48,381 --> 01:40:50,417
We found it, Fly.

1098
01:41:56,949 --> 01:41:58,051
Come on.

1099
01:41:58,751 --> 01:41:59,886
Come on.

1100
01:42:00,052 --> 01:42:01,555
Quiet.

1101
01:42:05,691 --> 01:42:07,594
Quiet. Quiet.

1102
01:42:08,194 --> 01:42:09,796
Breath. Breath.

1103
01:42:12,198 --> 01:42:15,468
Just breath. Breath gently.

1104
01:42:15,501 --> 01:42:17,037
You'll be ok.

1105
01:42:58,544 --> 01:43:00,647
You and me,
we're going home now.

1106
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:02,849
I need to be quiet.
Can you get up?

1107
01:43:02,882 --> 01:43:04,017
Ok, ready?

1108
01:43:04,050 --> 01:43:05,885
We're going home now, ok.

1109
01:43:05,918 --> 01:43:07,654
Stand up. Stand up.
Stand up.

1110
01:44:15,988 --> 01:44:19,826
Ok, I'm pretty much almost done,
but I need a break anyway.

1111
01:44:19,859 --> 01:44:22,161
So let's take the dog out
for some fresh air.

1112
01:44:22,194 --> 01:44:23,863
- Alright, let's grab our coats.
- Mm-hmm.

1113
01:44:23,896 --> 01:44:26,199
Did anyone get back to you
about your proposal?

1114
01:44:27,033 --> 01:44:28,268
Nothing.

1115
01:44:29,535 --> 01:44:32,205
I think maybe it's a question
of how the presentation is done.

1116
01:44:32,238 --> 01:44:35,008
No, everything is fine.
You just have to be realistic.

1117
01:44:35,108 --> 01:44:36,843
My plans aren't
commercially interesting.

1118
01:44:36,876 --> 01:44:40,813
But we won't have to worry
about money because

1119
01:44:40,846 --> 01:44:42,115
I got a gig.

1120
01:44:42,915 --> 01:44:44,985
- Really?
- Yeah.

1121
01:44:46,852 --> 01:44:48,688
I'm so proud of you, baby.

1122
01:44:49,655 --> 01:44:51,024
Concluding the trial involving

1123
01:44:51,057 --> 01:44:53,326
the Foundation
of Eternal Life

1124
01:44:53,359 --> 01:44:55,662
will end with a hung jury.

1125
01:44:56,329 --> 01:44:57,997
Charges are expected
to be dropped

1126
01:44:58,030 --> 01:44:59,966
due to a lack
of hard evidence,

1127
01:44:59,999 --> 01:45:01,901
as it was established
during court hearings,

1128
01:45:01,934 --> 01:45:03,803
that all subjects
of the experiment

1129
01:45:03,836 --> 01:45:05,605
were there legally.

1130
01:45:06,138 --> 01:45:07,640
Despite recent accusations,

1131
01:45:07,673 --> 01:45:09,142
the organization continues
to successfully

1132
01:45:09,175 --> 01:45:10,810
recruit followers...

1133
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:22,956
Do you think they
will come for us?

1134
01:45:22,989 --> 01:45:25,659
I'm not worried too much.
Why don't you go get dressed.

1135
01:45:40,873 --> 01:45:42,942
By the way, there was
a letter for you

1136
01:45:42,975 --> 01:45:44,043
in the mail this morning.

1137
01:45:44,076 --> 01:45:46,012
- Yeah, I saw it already.
- Yeah? What was it?

1138
01:45:51,651 --> 01:45:52,885
Uh, nothing
that's interesting.

1139
01:45:52,918 --> 01:45:55,722
You know, documents
for an old project.

1139
01:45:56,305 --> 01:46:56,498

1
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,920
Ronson's down.

2
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,589
He needs medical evac.

3
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,424
<i>Where is it? Is it there?</i>

4
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,508
Hard drive's gone.

5
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:34,510
<i>M: Are you sure?</i>

6
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,474
It's gone. Give me a minute.

7
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,517
<i>They must have it. Get after them.</i>

8
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,523
I'm stabilizing Ronson.

9
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:48,858
<i>We don't have the time.</i>

10
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,526
I have to stop the bleeding!

11
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,612
<i>Leave him!</i>

12
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,648
Have you got him?

13
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,608
He's in the black Audi.

14
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,694
- What about Ronson?
- He's been hit.

16
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,905
We're sending an emergency evacuation squad.

17
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,615
They'll be too bloody late!

18
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,284
He's seen us.

19
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,829
Medical evac for Ronson five minutes away.

20
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,170
That's all right. You weren't using it.

21
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,591
I wasn't using that one, either.

22
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,305
Keep your head down.

23
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,466
Just get clear!

24
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,053
Tanner, which way?

25
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,846
Keep going. I can direct you from here.

26
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,183
You both know what's at stake here.
We can't afford to lose that list.

28
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,309
Yes, ma'am.

29
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,465
Where are they now?

30
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,009
They appear to be on the rooftops
of the Grand Bazaar.

31
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,272
Take a left. There's a bridge.
You can cut him off.

32
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,554
Down, sir!

33
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,409
- What happened?
- They're on the train, ma'am.

34
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:51,702
<i>What do you mean on the train?</i>

35
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,079
I mean, they're on top of a train.

36
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,622
Well, get after them, for God's sake!

37
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,529
She's going out of range.

38
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:27,988
We've lost tracking. We're blind here.

39
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,990
- What's going on?
- I'm still with them.

40
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,201
Get me CCTV, satellite, anything!

41
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,502
M: <i>What was that?</i>

42
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,755
3 VW Beetles. I think.

44
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,366
<i>- Bond!</i>
- He's uncoupling the cars.

45
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,156
M: <i>007, are you all right?</i>

46
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,325
Just changing carriages.

47
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,912
<i>What's going on? Report!</i>

48
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,747
It's rather hard to explain, ma'am.

49
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,540
<i>007's still in pursuit.</i>

50
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:52,234
Looks like there isn't much more road.
I don't think I can go any further.

52
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,270
I may have a shot.

53
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,612
It's not clean.

54
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,364
<i>Repeat, I do not have a clean shot.</i>

55
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,831
There's a tunnel ahead.
I'm gonna lose them.

56
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,625
Can you get into a better position?

57
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,335
Negative. There's no time.

58
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,463
Take the shot.

59
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,758
<i>I said take the shot.</i>

60
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,803
I can't! I may hit Bond.

61
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,137
Take the bloody shot!

62
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,870
<i>Agent down.</i>

63
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,753
<i>This is the end</i>

64
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,844
<i>Hold your breath and count to ten</i>

65
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:30,601
<i>Feel the earth move and then</i>

66
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:37,858
<i>Hear my heart burst again</i>

67
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:42,237
<i>For this is the end</i>

68
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,286
<i>I've drowned and dreamt this moment</i>

69
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:55,918
<i>So overdue, I owe them</i>

70
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:02,674
<i>Swept away, I'm stolen</i>

71
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,971
<i>Let the sky fall</i>

72
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,849
<i>When it crumbles</i>

73
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,186
<i>We will stand tall</i>

74
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,605
<i>And face it all together</i>

75
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,066
<i>At Skyfall</i>

76
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,657
<i>Skyfall is where we start</i>

77
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,121
<i>A thousand miles and poles apart</i>

78
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:39,711
<i>Where worlds collide and days are dark</i>

79
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,130
<i>You may have my number</i>

80
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,007
<i>You can take my name</i>

81
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:49,721
<i>But you'll never have my heart</i>

82
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,224
<i>Let the sky fall</i>

83
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,143

<i>And face it all together At Skyfall</i>

90
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,172
<i>Where you go I go</i>

91
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,384
<i>What you see I see</i>

92
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:32,889
<i>I know I'd never be me
without the security</i>

93
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,227
<i>Of your loving arms</i>

94
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,188
<i>keeping me from harm</i>

95
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:45,152
<i>Put your hand in my hand and we'll stand</i>

96
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,114
<i>Let the sky fall</i>

97
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,534

98
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,203

00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,716

<i>At Skyfall</i>

108
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,233
It's like being summoned
to the headmaster's study.

109
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,736
It's a new Chairman.
Just standard procedure.

110
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,988
Bloody waste of my time is what I call it.

111
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:57,242
I'm sorry to have to deal with such
a delicate subject at our first encounter.

113
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:03,665
But, um... I have to be frank with you.

115
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,834
I think that would be a good idea.

116
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,881
The Prime Minister's concerned.

117
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,509
Well, you can tell him my operatives
are pursuing every avenue.

118
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,678
Have you considered pulling out the agents?

119
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,180
I've considered every option.

120
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,599
Forgive me, that sounds like an evasion.

121
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,684
Forgive me, but why am I here?

122
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:27,773
Three months ago, you lost the computer drive
containing the identity...

123
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,358
...of almost every N.A.T.O. agent embedded...

124
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,903
...in terrorist organizations across the globe.

125
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,406
A list which, in the eyes of our allies,
never existed.

126
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:40,410
So if you'll forgive me,
I think you know why you're here.

127
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,370
Are we to call this "civilian oversight"?

128
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,041
No, we're to call this "retirement planning."

129
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:51,880
Your country has only the highest respect for you
and your many years of service.

131
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:57,052
When your current posting is completed,
you'll be awarded GCMG with full honors.

133
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,222
Congratulations.

134
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,098
You're firing me.

135
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,643
No, ma'am, I'm here to oversee
the transition period...

136
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,479
...leading to your voluntary retirement
in two months' time.

137
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,398
Your successor has yet to be appointed,
so we'll be asking you...

138
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,275
I'm not an idiot, Mallory.

139
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:15,070
I know I can't do this job forever...

140
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,364
...but I'll be damned if I'm going
to leave the department...

141
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,491
...in worse shape than I found it.

142
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,160
M, you've had a great run.

143
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,287
You should leave with dignity.

144
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,582
Oh, to hell with dignity.
I'll leave when the job's done.

145
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:47,811
Yes?

146
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,480
Now?

147
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:56,444
Ma'am, alert from Q-Branch.
Someone's trying to decrypt the stolen hard drive.

148
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,947
We're tracing the encryption signal.

149
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,615
Localizing now.

150
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,120
Centering in the UK.

151
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,540
London.

152
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,625
Get us back to base as soon as possible.

153
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,468
- It's coming from MI-6.
- What?

155
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,762
The data packet is linking to our network.

156
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,473
Correction. This is behind our firewall.

157
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,184
- We should shut down.
- No, track it.

159
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,395
We have to know where it's coming from.

160
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,314
Strip the headers. Trace the source.

161
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,357
How the hell did they get into our system?

162
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,318
Getting trace back now.

163
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,490
It appears...

164
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:47,329
- It appears to be your computer, ma'am.
- Shut it down.

166
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,502
What's this?

167
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,859
For God's sake!

168
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,404
Just get out of the way!

169
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,032
- Don't you recognize the car?
- Madam.

170
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,636
Oh...!

terrorist attack in the heart of London.</i>

176
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,783
<i>No-one has yet claimed responsibility
for what sources are calling...</i>

177
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:16,204
<i>...a possible "cyber-terrorist assault"
on the British Secret Service.</i>

178
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:20,917
<i>Early reports from the scene indicate
at least six dead, many more injured...</i>

180
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:25,964
<i>...with victims being evacuated to local hospitals
within minutes of the explosion.</i>

182
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,151
It's time to go, ma'am.

183
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:51,406
I'm going to find whoever did this.

184
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:45,126
- Where the hell have you been?
- Enjoying death.

186
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:49,047
007 reporting for duty.

187
00:25:56,472 --> 00:26:00,475
- Why didn't you call?
- You didn't get the postcard?

189
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,727
You should try it some time.
Get away from it all.

190
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,687
It really lends perspective.

191
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,148
Ran out of drink where you were, did they?

192
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:11,486
What was it you said?
"Take the bloody shot."

194
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,029
I made a judgment call.

195
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,657
You should have trusted me to finish the job.

196
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,659
It was the possibility of losing you...

197
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,328
...or the certainty of losing
all those other agents.

198
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,331
I made the only decision I could
and you know it.

199
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,667
I think you lost your nerve.

200
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,253
What do you expect, a bloody apology?

201
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:31,589
You know the rules of the game.
You've been playing it long enough.

203
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:34,926
We both have.
Maybe too long.

205
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,262
Speak for yourself.

206
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,849
Ronson didn't make it, did he?

207
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,018
No.

208
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:51,276
So this is it.
We're both played out.

210
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,404
Well, if you believe that,
why did you come back?

211
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,197
Good question.

212
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:03,788
Because we're under attack.
And you know we need you.

214
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,294
Well, I'm here.

215
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:14,632
You'll have to be debriefed
and declared fit for active service.

216
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,552
You can only return to duty when
you've passed the tests...

217
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,054
...so take them seriously.

218
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,640
And a shower might be in order.

219
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:24,892
I'll go home and change.

220
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:29,063
Oh, we've sold your flat, put
your things into storage.

221
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:35,611
Standard procedure on the death of
an unmarried employee with no next of kin.

223
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:37,405
You should have called.

224
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,282
I'll find a hotel.

225
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,909
Well, you're bloody well not sleeping here.

226
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,440
The assailant hacked into the
environmental control system...

227
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,108
...locked out the safety protocols...

228
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:17,612
...and turned on the gas, all of which
should have been impossible.

229
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,114
On top of that, they hacked into her files.

230
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:23,534
They knew her appointments,
knew she'd be out of the building.

231
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,453
They weren't targeting her.

232
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,039
They wanted her to see it.

233
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,750
Where are we, Tanner?

234
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,168
New digs.

235
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:43,221
The old building was declared
"strategically vulnerable".

236
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,473
That's putting it mildly.

237
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:48,976
He was able to breach the most secure
computer system in Britain.

238
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,853
So we're on war footing now.

239
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,856
This was part of Churchill's bunker.

240
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,984
We're still discovering tunnels
dating back to the 18th Century.

242
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,487
Quite fascinating, if it wasn't for the rats.

243
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,155
When do I see M?

244
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,700
Tomorrow you'll see M and Mallory,
too, if you're lucky.

245
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:05,993
Who's Mallory?

246
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,830
The new Chairman of the Intelligence
and Security Committee.

247
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,499
Charming man. I think you and he
are really going to hit it off.

249
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,753
Welcome to the new MI6.

250
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,897
We've attempted to trace
the computer message, but...

251
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,025
...it was sent by an asymmetrical
security algorithm...

252
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,694
...which bounced the signal
all over the globe...

253
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,779
...through over a thousand different servers.

254
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:43,573
And now that they've accessed M's codes...

255
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,367
...it's only a matter of time before
they're able to decrypt the list.

256
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,953
Q-Branch have been analyzing
the picture but so far nothing.

257
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,373
The general feeling is it's probably
someone from her past.

258
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:55,042
Perhaps when she was running
things in Hong Kong.

259
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,544
She's no idea what it all means.

260
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,795
You believe that?

261
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,964
The truth is, we don't have
a clue who took the list...

262
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,384
...or what they plan to do with it.

263
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,517
We can always do this later.

264
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:15,438
You know what? Let's.

265
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:25,466
I'd like to start with some
simple word associations.

266
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,969
Just tell me the first word
that pops into your head.

267
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,513
For example, I might say "Day"
and you might say...

268
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:31,639
"Wasted".

269
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,228
All right.

270
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:47,530
- "Gun". - "Shot".
- "Agent". - "Provocateur".

273
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:51,993
- "Woman". - "Provocatrix".
- "Heart". - "Target".

277
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:55,538
- "Bird".
- "Sky".

279
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:57,915
- "M".
- "Bitch".

281
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:04,505
- "Sunlight". - "Swim".
- "Moonlight". - "Dance".

284
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,258
- "Murder".
- "Employment".

286
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,552
- "Country".
- "England".

287
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:17,935
"Skyfall".

288
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,607
Done.

289
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,865
Well, this is going well.

290
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,498
Get these analyzed.

291
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,084
For her eyes only.

292
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,114
She's ready for you.

293
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:58,619
- I'm sorry, have we met before?
- I'm the one who should say "sorry".

295
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:05,209
It was only four ribs.
Some of the less vital organs.

297
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,421
Nothing major.

298
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:17,138
- Not enough excitement in Istanbul?
- I've been reassigned.

300
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:20,891
- Temporary suspension from field work.
- Really? Mmm.

302
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,643
Something to do with killing 007.

303
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:26,647
- Well, you gave it your best shot.
- That was hardly my best shot.

305
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,985
- I'm not sure I could survive your best.
- I doubt you'll get the chance.

307
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:34,405
Well, do me a favor, will you?
If they do ever let you back out there...

308
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,158
...warn me first.

309
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:42,496
I'm assisting Gareth Mallory in the transition,
and then I'll be back in the field.

311
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,916
- That's what you want?
- Yes, of course.

313
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:47,668
It's not for everyone.

314
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,087
Ah, 007. It's this way.

315
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:55,593
In your defense, a moving target
is much harder to hit.

316
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,263
Then you better keep moving.

317
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,569
The whole office goes up in smoke
and that bloody thing survives.

319
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,573
Your interior decorating tips
have always been appreciated, 007.

320
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,910
007, Gareth Mallory.

321
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:22,453
I hope I haven't missed anything.

322
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,038
The PM does prattle on in a crisis.

323
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,289
Bond.

324
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:26,791
Mallory.

325
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,423
I've just been reviewing Bond's tests.

326
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:38,052
It seems you've passed...
by the skin of your teeth.

327
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,262
You're back on active service.

328
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:43,599
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

330
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:46,644
I'll, um... I'll be outside.

332
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:51,565
I only have one question.
Why not stay dead?

334
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:56,278
You have the perfect way out.
Go and live quietly somewhere.

335
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:59,657
Not many field agents
get to leave this cleanly.

336
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,450
Do you get out in the field much?

337
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:06,163
You don't need to be an operative
to see the obvious.

338
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,791
It's a young man's game.

339
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,585
Look, you've been seriously injured.

340
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,004
There's no shame in saying
you've lost a step.

341
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,091
The only shame would be not admitting
it until it's too late.

342
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,178
Hire me or fire me.
It's entirely up to you.

343
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,265
If he says he's ready, he's ready.

344
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,852
Perhaps you can't see it,
or maybe you won't.

345
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,647
- What exactly are you implying?
- You're sentimental about him.

347
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,819
As long as I'm head of this department,
I'll choose my own operatives.

348
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,865
Fair enough.

349
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:47,037
Good luck, 007.

350
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,874
Don't cock it up.

351
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,716
We've analyzed the shrapnel fragments.

352
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,093
You're lucky it wasn't a direct hit

353
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,553
or it would have cut you in half.

354
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:05,973
It's a depleted uranium shell.
Military grade.

355
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:11,812
Hard to get, extremely expensive,
and only used by a select few.

357
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,148
Recognize anyone?

358
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,067
Him.

359
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:20,487
Okay. Name's Patrice.

360
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:23,032
He's a ghost. No known residence
or country of origin.

361
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,742
So how do we find him?

362
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:28,078
Well, luckily, we still have
one or two friends left in the CIA.

363
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,997
They're after him for the Yemeni
ambassador's murder...

364
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,874
...and they're getting close.

365
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:35,920
Intel is he's going to be in Shanghai
in two days time, probably on a job.

367
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,672
You're to go there and await
further instructions.

368
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,758
If he turns up, he's yours.

369
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:44,219
Find out who he works for
and who has the list.

370
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:48,015
- Then terminate him, for Ronson.
- With pleasure.

372
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:53,479
- Is there anything else you want to tell me?
- No.

374
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,358
Report to the new Quartermaster
for your documentation.

375
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:02,029
He hasn't set up shop yet, but Tanner
will put you two together. Good luck.

377
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,281
Thank you.

378
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,827
007.

379
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,040
You are ready for this?

380
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,459
Yes, ma'am.

381
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,548
I didn't know Bond passed the tests.

382
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,384
He didn't.

383
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,374
Always makes me feel a little melancholy.

384
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:59,294
A grand old warship being ignominiously
hauled away for scrap.

385
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,883
The inevitability of time, don't you think?

386
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:08,887
What do you see?

387
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:12,516
A bloody big ship.

388
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:14,852
Excuse me.

389
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,603
007...

390
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,190
I'm your new Quartermaster.

391
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:23,610
You must be joking.

392
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:27,948
- Why, because I'm not wearing a lab coat?
- Because you still have spots.

394
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,870
- My complexion is hardly relevant.
- Well, your competence is.

396
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:38,542
- Age is no guarantee of efficiency.
- And youth is no guarantee of innovation.

398
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:42,337
I'll hazard I can do more damage
on my laptop sitting in my pajamas...

400
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:45,841
...before my first cup of Earl Grey
than you can do in a year in the field.

402
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,551
Oh, so why do you need me?

403
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,221
Every now and then a trigger
has to be pulled.

404
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:53,807
Or not pulled.

405
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:57,061
It's hard to know which in your pajamas.

406
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,649
Q.

407
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:04,526
007.

408
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,617
Ticket to Shanghai.
Documentation and passport.

410
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:14,203
- Thank you.
- And this.

412
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,584
Walther PPK/S 9mm short.

413
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:24,588
There's a micro-dermal sensor in the grip.

414
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:28,258
It's been coded to your palm print
so only you can fire it.

415
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,513
Less of a random killing machine,
more of a personal statement.

416
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,014
And this?

417
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:37,726
Standard issue radio transmitter.

418
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,730
Activate it and it broadcasts your location.

419
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:43,649
Distress signal.

420
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,443
And that's it.

421
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:52,449
A gun... and a radio.

423
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,787
Not exactly Christmas, is it?

424
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,040
Were you expecting an exploding pen?

425
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,710
We don't really go in for that anymore.

426
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,220
Good luck out there in the field.

427
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,807
And please return the equipment
in one piece.

428
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,730
Brave new world.

429
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:44,939
Who's got the list?

430
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:52,197
Tell me! Who are you working for?

431
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,330
Tanner... He's posted the first five names.

432
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:27,500
Their cover's blown.
They're in danger. Get them out now.

433
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,250
<i>Room service.<i>

434
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,720
I didn't order anything. Not even you.

435
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:22,722
I've got some new information.

436
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:27,477
Aren't you a little overqualified
to be delivering messages?

437
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,230
It's all part of the learning curve.

438
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:34,859
- And Q's afraid of flying.
- Of course he is.

440
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:38,738
So whoever stole the list
has already decrypted it.

441
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:41,908
They posted the first five names on the web.

442
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:45,870
- Well, it was only a matter of time.
- Well, that's just the start.

444
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,915
They're posting five more next week,
and the week after.

445
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,709
It's some kind of sadistic game.

446
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:58,758
Cut-throat razor.

447
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:02,095
How very traditional.

448
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:06,099
Well, I like to do some things
the old-fashioned way.

449
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:11,396
Sometimes the old ways are the best.

450
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,617
Are you putting your life
in my hands again?

451
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:28,288
M's...

452
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,624
...already briefed me on the list.

453
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:37,130
Raising the tantalizing question
of what you're really doing here.

455
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,884
My official directive was to help...

456
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,637
..."in any way I can."

457
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,808
Like spying for Mallory.

458
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:53,479
You know, Mallory's not as bad as you think.

459
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,482
He's a bureaucrat.

460
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,277
You should do your homework.

461
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:02,447
Gareth Mallory was a Lieutenant Colonel...

462
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:05,283
Lieutenant Colonel in Northern Ireland,
Hereford Regiment.

463
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:07,869
Spent three months at the hands of the IRA.

464
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:12,332
So there's more to him than meets the eye.

465
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:16,336
We'll see.

466
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,672
Keep still.

467
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,177
This is the tricky part.

468
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,690
Now that's better.

469
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:40,068
You look the part now.

470
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:42,195
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

471
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:45,490
And what part's that?

472
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:49,035
Old dog...

473
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,038
...new tricks.

474
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:05,445
Good evening.

475
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:06,988
<i>Evening.</i>

476
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:08,948
Don't touch your ear.

477
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:12,285
I've got three exits...

478
00:56:13,162 --> 00:56:15,121
...lots of blind spots.

479
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:17,290
I've got them covered.

480
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:25,631
You look beautiful in that dress.

481
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:27,425
<i>You don't scrub up so bad yourself.</i>

482
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:30,470
It's amazing what one can do
with an extra pair of hands.

483
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,638
<i>You're telling me.</i>

484
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:36,017
Do you gamble?

485
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:37,852
<i>I like a little flutter now and then.</i>

486
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:42,982
<i>Who doesn't like to take chances?</i>

487
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:50,323
Good evening, sir.
How may I help you?

488
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,492
I'd like to cash this in, please.

489
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,500
One moment, sir.

490
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,534
Good fortune tonight, sir.

491
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,208
Let's hope so.

492
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:54,720
- With compliments of the house.
- Thank you.

494
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,411
Now you can afford to buy me a drink.

495
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:22,915
Maybe I'll even stretch to two.

496
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:26,586
I'm guessing I've got four
million euros in here.

497
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:31,799
- Not bad. I like this game.
- Why don't we play another?

499
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:34,927
I don't gamble.

500
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:42,268
- I'm not very lucky.
- A little like our friend in Shanghai.

502
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:49,609
I've been waiting to see who
would redeem the chip.

503
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:53,487
You made such a bold entrance
into our little drama.

504
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,907
Did I over-complicate the plot?

505
00:58:57,242 --> 00:59:00,119
Who doesn't appreciate the
occasional twist, Mr...?

506
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:03,414
Bond. James Bond.

508
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,958
Severine.

509
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:10,796
So, Mr. Bond, shall we discuss your
next performance over that drink?

510
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:12,965
I'd like that.

511
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,137
Will your friends be joining us?

512
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,975
That, I'm afraid, is inevitable.

513
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:28,856
<i>- She's pretty.</i>
- Now, now.

515
00:59:29,024 --> 00:59:31,150
<i>If you like that sort of thing.</i>

516
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,527
I'll keep you posted.

517
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:46,499
Perfect.

518
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:52,046
Would you mind if I asked
you a business question?

519
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,674
Depends on the question.

520
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:57,885
It has to do with death.

521
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:02,223
A subject in which you're well-versed.

522
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,183
And how would you know that?

523
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,396
Only a certain kind of woman
wears a backless dress...

524
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:11,732
...with a Beretta 70 strapped to her thigh.

525
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:17,863
One can never be too careful when
handsome men in tuxedos carry Walthers.

527
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:23,244
I am correct in assuming you killed Patrice?

528
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,705
Yes.

529
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:29,250
Might I ask why?

530
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,253
I want to meet your employer.

531
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,059
Be careful what you wish for.

532
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:50,187
You're scared.

533
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,940
Thank you for the drink...

534
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,569
...Mr. Bond.

535
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,412
You put on a good show.

536
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:10,541
But ever since we sat down,
you haven't stopped...

537
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,626
...looking at your bodyguards.

538
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:16,630
Now, three of them is a bit excessive.

539
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:20,551
They're controlling you.
They're not protecting you.

540
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:25,973
The tattoo on your wrist is Macau sex trade.

541
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:30,603
You belonged to one of the houses.
What were you? 12? 13?

542
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:34,315
I'm guessing he was your way out.

543
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:37,777
Perhaps you thought you were in love.

544
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:41,655
But that was a long time ago.

545
01:01:44,076 --> 01:01:46,118
You know nothing about it.

546
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:49,789
I know when a woman is afraid
and pretending not to be.

547
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:57,505
- How much do you know about fear?
- All there is.

549
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,633
Not like this.

550
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:04,804
Not like him.

551
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,681
I can help you.

552
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:10,976
- I don't think so.
- Let me try.

554
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:14,814
How?

555
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:17,650
Bring me to him.

556
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:22,655
- Can you kill him?
- Yes.

558
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:25,324
Will you?

559
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:27,827
Someone usually dies.

560
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,375
Perhaps you can.

561
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,802
When I leave, they're going to kill you.

562
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:52,393
If you survive, I'm on the Chimera.
North harbor. Berth seven.

564
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:55,896
We cast off in an hour.

565
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:03,404
Very nice to have met you, Mr. Bond.

566
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:06,574
Good luck.

567
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,036
Good luck with that.

568
01:04:58,687 --> 01:04:59,812
Thank you.

569
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:06,110
Put it all on red.

570
01:05:08,989 --> 01:05:10,656
It's the circle of life.

571
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:35,973
Yes!

572
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:41,729
It's time to cast off.

573
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:44,857
All right.

574
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:43,248
I like you better without your Beretta.

575
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:48,587
I feel naked without it.

576
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:06,980
<i>Good evening.</i>

577
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:10,567
<i>The controversy surrounding the Ministry
of Defence has escalated today...</i>

578
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:14,321
<i>...as images of the Husein assassination
continue to circulate.</i>

579
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:18,283
<i>We should warn you, some viewers
might find these images disturbing.</i>

581
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:22,955
<i>Captain Husein, an MI-6 operative
embedded in the Middle East...</i>

582
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:26,959
<i>was one of the five agents exposed
in what is now being considered...</i>

584
01:07:27,085 --> 01:07:30,629
<i>...the greatest internal security breach
in modern British history.</i>

585
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:34,800
<i>The Prime Minister continues
to express public support for MI-6...</i>

586
01:07:34,926 --> 01:07:37,010
<i>...while the opposition
has taken the position...</i>

587
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:39,805
Has taken the position we're a bunch
of antiquated bloody idiots...

588
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,975
...fighting a war we don't understand
and can't possibly win.

589
01:07:43,435 --> 01:07:47,187
Look, three of my agents are dead already.
Don't embroil me in politics now.

591
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:50,649
The Prime Minister's ordered an inquiry.
You'll have to appear.

592
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:54,069
Oh, standing in the stocks at midday?
Who's antiquated now?

593
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:56,405
For Christ's sake, listen to
yourself. We're a democracy,

594
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:59,116
accountable to the people
we're trying to defend.

595
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,327
We can't keep working in the shadows.
There are no more shadows.

596
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:04,246
You don't get this, do you?

597
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:08,709
Whoever's behind this,
whoever's doing it, he knows us.

598
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:12,087
He's one of us. He comes from
the same place as Bond.

599
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:17,009
The place you say doesn't exist.
The shadows.

601
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:57,174
It's not too late.
We could turn back now.

602
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,682
I wouldn't be so sure.

603
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:45,806
They abandoned it almost overnight.

604
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:50,227
He made them think
there was a leak at the chemical plant.

605
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:54,940
It's amazing the panic you can cause
with a single computer.

606
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:59,945
He wanted the island, so he took it.

607
01:10:01,573 --> 01:10:06,577
- Does he always get what he wants?
- More than you know.

609
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:10,956
I'm sorry.

610
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,778
Hello, James. Welcome.

611
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,656
Do you like the island?

612
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:49,536
My grandmother had an island.

613
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:53,206
Nothing to boast of.
You could walk around it in an hour.

614
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:56,376
But still, it was, it was a paradise for us.

615
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:59,504
One summer, we went for a visit...

616
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:03,634
...and discovered the place
had been infested with rats!

617
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:08,221
They'd come on a fishing boat
and gorged themselves on coconut.

618
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:11,058
So how do you get rats
off an island? Hmm?

619
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:13,727
My grandmother showed me.

620
01:11:14,646 --> 01:11:17,356
We buried an oil drum and hinged the lid...

621
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,733
...then wired coconut to the lid as bait.

622
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:21,860
And the rats would come
for the coconut and...

623
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,530
...they would fall into the drum.

624
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:29,743
And after a month,
you have trapped all the rats.

625
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,412
But what do you do then?

626
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:38,377
Throw the drum into the ocean?
Burn it? No.

628
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:40,754
You just leave it.

629
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:44,091
And they begin to get hungry.

630
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:46,718
And one by one...

631
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:50,722
...they start eating each other...

632
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:54,226
...until there are only two left.
The two survivors.

633
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:57,020
And then what? Do you kill them?
No.

634
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,941
You take them
and release them into the trees.

635
01:12:01,401 --> 01:12:04,111
But now they don't eat coconut anymore.

636
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:06,780
Now they only eat rat.

637
01:12:08,408 --> 01:12:10,784
You have changed their nature.

638
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:14,162
The two survivors...

639
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,665
...this is what she made us.

640
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:21,461
I made my own choices.

641
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:23,839
You think you did.

642
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:26,425
That's her genius.

643
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:32,347
Station H. Am I right?
Hong Kong.

644
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:33,640
Mm-hmm.

645
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,268
'86 to '97.

646
01:12:36,978 --> 01:12:39,229
Back then, I was her favorite.

647
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:42,899
And you're not nearly the agent
I was, I can tell you that.

648
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:49,072
Just look at you, barely held together
by your pills and your drink.

649
01:12:49,157 --> 01:12:50,949
Don't forget my pathetic love of country.

650
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:56,621
You're still clinging to your faith
in that old woman.

651
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:59,458
When all she does is lie to you.
She never lied to me.

652
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:01,168
- No?
- No.

653
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:03,712
What did you score
in your marksmanship evaluation?

654
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:05,088
70.

655
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:07,799
40.

656
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:12,262
Did she tell you the psychologist
cleared you for duty?

657
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,681
- Yes.
- No. No.

658
01:13:23,191 --> 01:13:27,611
Medical evaluation: Failed.
Physical evaluation: Failed.

659
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:30,113
"Alcohol..."

660
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,449
"...and substance addiction indicated."

661
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:37,621
"Pathological rejection of authority..."

662
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:40,165
"...based on unresolved childhood trauma."

663
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:48,507
"Subject is not approved for field duty..."

664
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:51,676
"...and immediate suspension
from service advised."

665
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:54,054
What is this if not betrayal?

666
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:58,183
She sent you after me knowing you're not ready,
knowing you'll likely die.

667
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:00,852
Mommy was very bad!

668
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:05,398
Hmm?

669
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:23,416
Ooh.

670
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,711
See what she's done to you?

671
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:30,715
Well, she never tied me to a chair.

672
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,509
Her loss.

673
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:40,016
- Are you sure this is about M?
- It's about her...

675
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:43,228
...and you, and me.

676
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:47,232
You see, we are the last two rats.

677
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:49,693
We can either eat each other...

678
01:14:52,864 --> 01:14:53,864
Hmm?

679
01:14:56,409 --> 01:14:58,285
...or eat everyone else.

680
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:04,583
How you're trying to remember
your training now.

681
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:08,545
What's the regulation to cover this?

682
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:15,427
Well, first time for everything.
Yes?

683
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:21,433
What makes you think this is my first time?

684
01:15:22,602 --> 01:15:24,728
Oh, Mr. Bond!

685
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:31,109
All that physical stuff...
So dull, so dull.

686
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:37,365
Chasing spies... so old-fashioned!

688
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:42,621
Your knees must be killing you.

689
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:48,752
England.

690
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:51,630
The Empire! MI-6!

691
01:15:52,173 --> 01:15:54,090
You're living in a ruin as well...

692
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,967
...you just don't know it yet.

693
01:15:57,345 --> 01:16:01,806
At least here there are no old ladies
giving orders and no little...

694
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:03,892
Bip!

695
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:06,478
Gadgets from those fools in Q-Branch.

696
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:14,027
If you wanted, you could pick
your own secret missions. As I do.

697
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:19,824
Name it.

698
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:26,748
Destabilize a multinational
by manipulating stocks... Bip. Easy.

700
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:32,462
Interrupt transmissions from a spy satellite
over Kabul... Done.

702
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:37,133
Hmm. Rig an election in Uganda.
All to the highest bidder.

703
01:16:37,677 --> 01:16:39,844
Or a gas explosion in London.

704
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:44,641
- Just point and click.
- Well, everybody needs a hobby.

706
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:52,315
So what's yours?

707
01:16:54,986 --> 01:16:56,528
Resurrection.

708
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:02,158
Let me show you something.

709
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:16,715
Tells a story, doesn't it?

710
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:22,679
They left the island so quickly...

711
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:26,766
...they couldn't decide what to take,
what to leave, what was important.

713
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:31,021
And seeing this every day
reminds me to focus on the essentials.

714
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:34,899
There's nothing... nothing
superfluous in my life.

715
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:38,737
When a thing is redundant, it is eliminated.

716
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,082
50-year-old McCullan.

717
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:54,544
A particular favorite of yours, I understand.

718
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:59,090
So, what's the toast?

719
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:03,720
"To the women we love"?

720
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:05,263
Hmm.

721
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:15,940
Darling...

722
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:19,611
Darling, your lovers are here.

723
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:26,618
No, no, no, no.

724
01:18:27,161 --> 01:18:29,162
Stand up straight. Keep still.

725
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:32,957
And whatever you do, don't lose your head.

726
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:36,169
Don't lose... your head.

728
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:40,799
Don't lose your head.

729
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:44,594
Time to redeem your marksmanship scores.

730
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:47,472
Let's see.

731
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:52,477
Who can be the first to knock
the glass from her head?

732
01:18:58,526 --> 01:19:01,319
And just to be sporting,
I'll let you go first.

733
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:21,840
Let's see who ends up on top.

734
01:19:34,854 --> 01:19:36,688
Oh, I can't believe it.

735
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:40,483
I can't believe it!
Did you really die that day?

736
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:45,321
Is there any, any of the old 007 left?

737
01:19:53,873 --> 01:19:55,206
My turn.

738
01:19:58,878 --> 01:20:01,713
I win.
What do you say to that?

739
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:06,509
It's a waste of good Scotch.

740
01:20:17,897 --> 01:20:21,441
What are you going to do now?
Take me back to her? All on your own?

741
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:23,902
Who says I'm on my own?

742
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:47,759
It's the latest thing from Q-Branch.
It's called a radio.

744
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:10,949
All right, time to say hello.

745
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:45,984
You're smaller than I remember!

746
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:48,987
Whereas I barely remember you at all.

747
01:21:49,405 --> 01:21:52,490
Strange.
For me, it feels just like yesterday.

748
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:55,868
Are you surprised?

749
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:59,414
Not particularly. But then
you always were a slippery one.

750
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:01,874
Maybe that's why you liked me so much.

751
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:05,336
- You flatter yourself.
- No remorse.

753
01:22:07,715 --> 01:22:09,882
Just as I had imagined.

754
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:12,176
Regret is unprofessional.

755
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:20,518
"Regret is unprofessional."

756
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:25,690
They kept me for 5 months in a room
with no air. They tortured me.

757
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:28,860
And I protected your secrets.
I protected you.

758
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:33,281
But they made me suffer. And suffer.

759
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:36,868
And suffer.

760
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,871
Until I realized...

761
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:43,374
...it was you who betrayed me.

762
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,377
You betrayed me.

763
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:50,798
So, I had only one thing left.

764
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:56,220
My cyanide capsule in my back left molar.

765
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:58,890
You remember, right?

766
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:05,063
So I broke the tooth and...

767
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:07,565
...bit into the capsule.

768
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:09,567
And it...

769
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:15,740
It burned all my insides.

770
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:17,950
But I didn't die.

771
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:23,915
Life clung to me like a disease.

772
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:29,587
And then...

773
01:23:29,797 --> 01:23:33,591
I understood why I had survived.

774
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:39,764
I needed to look in your eyes one last time.

775
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:44,769
Well, I hope it was worth it.

776
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:50,775
Mr. Silva, you're going to be transferred
to Belmarsh Prison...

777
01:23:51,318 --> 01:23:55,613
...where you'll be remanded in custody
until the Crown Prosecution Service...

779
01:23:55,739 --> 01:23:57,490
...deem you fit to stand trial for...

780
01:23:57,616 --> 01:24:01,953
Say my name. Say it.
My real name.

782
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,497
I know you remember it.

783
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:10,128
Your name is on the memorial wall
of the very building you attacked.

785
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:12,630
I will have it struck off.

786
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:17,552
Soon your past will be as nonexistent
as your future.

787
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:20,471
I'll never see you again.

788
01:24:23,308 --> 01:24:25,309
Do you know what it does to you?

789
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:29,731
Hydrogen cyanide?

790
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:44,829
Look upon your work...

791
01:24:45,873 --> 01:24:47,165
...Mother.

792
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:27,789
Let me know what you recover
from his computer.

793
01:25:27,915 --> 01:25:31,375
Has he transmitted the lists?
If so, to whom? I want this resolved.

794
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:32,543
Yes, ma'am.

795
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:43,554
His name is Tiago Rodriguez.
He was a brilliant agent.

797
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:47,725
But he started operating beyond
his brief, hacking the Chinese.

798
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:52,480
The handover was coming up
and they were onto him, so I gave him up.

799
01:25:52,606 --> 01:25:55,733
I got six agents in return
and a peaceful transition.

800
01:25:56,109 --> 01:25:58,986
We should go, ma'am.
Board of Inquiry begins in 30 minutes.

801
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:01,489
I want to know what's on that computer.

802
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:16,796
Now, looking at Silva's computer...

803
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:21,217
...it seems to me he's done a number
of slightly unusual things.

804
01:26:21,301 --> 01:26:24,303
He's established failsafe protocols
to wipe the memory...

805
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:26,973
...if there's any attempt
to access certain files.

806
01:26:27,808 --> 01:26:30,518
Only six people in the world
could program safeguards like that.

807
01:26:30,644 --> 01:26:32,645
Of course there are.
Can you get past them?

808
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,981
I invented them.

809
01:26:38,318 --> 01:26:39,485
Right, then.

810
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:43,990
Let's see what you've got for us, Mr. Silva.

811
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:47,785
We're in.

812
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:56,752
Sir, what do you make of this?

813
01:27:01,884 --> 01:27:03,593
It's his Omega site.

814
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:06,304
Most encrypted level he has.

815
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:11,976
Looks like obfuscated code
to conceal its true purpose.

816
01:27:13,312 --> 01:27:15,438
Security through obscurity.

817
01:27:17,316 --> 01:27:19,859
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I might have order?

818
01:27:21,028 --> 01:27:22,653
I'd like to begin the proceedings.

819
01:27:24,823 --> 01:27:27,491
We're gathered today to address
important issues...

820
01:27:27,618 --> 01:27:30,161
...concerning the future
of our national security.

821
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:37,835
Going somewhere?

822
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:43,549
So you believe your stewardship
of MI-6 during the recent crisis...

823
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:45,009
...has been up to scratch?

824
01:27:45,385 --> 01:27:48,471
Well, I believe we have apprehended
the responsible party...

825
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:50,348
...and are taking all necessary steps...

826
01:27:50,474 --> 01:27:53,184
...to ensure that the sensitive
information is contained.

827
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:56,312
Oh... so it's a job well done.

829
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:58,147
I'm not saying it's gone perfectly, but...

830
01:27:58,315 --> 01:28:00,942
You'll forgive me
for not putting up the bunting.

831
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:05,363
I find it rather difficult to overlook monumental
security breaches and dead operatives...

833
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:08,282
...for which you are almost
single-handedly responsible.

834
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:13,663
He's using a polymorphic engine
to mutate the code.

835
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:15,998
Whenever I try to gain access, it changes.

836
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:19,210
It's like solving a Rubik's cube
that's fighting back.

837
01:28:25,342 --> 01:28:26,384
Stop.

838
01:28:28,095 --> 01:28:29,512
Go in on that.

839
01:28:36,186 --> 01:28:37,228
Granborough.

840
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:41,691
Granborough Road. It's an old
Tube station on the Metropolitan Line.

841
01:28:41,817 --> 01:28:43,442
Been closed for years.

842
01:28:45,487 --> 01:28:47,071
Use that as a key.

843
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,084
Oh, look, it's a map!

844
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:06,799
It's London.
Subterranean London.

846
01:29:08,385 --> 01:29:10,594
What's going on?
Why are the doors open?

847
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:22,064
Oh, no.

848
01:29:22,149 --> 01:29:24,400
Can someone tell me how the hell
he got into our system?

849
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:30,031
Oh, shit.

850
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:33,159
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

851
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:36,120
He hacked us.

852
01:29:43,754 --> 01:29:45,171
Oh, no.

853
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:54,513
Q.

854
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:56,348
He's gone.

855
01:30:05,942 --> 01:30:07,902
I'm in a stairwell below isolation.

856
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:11,322
<i>- Do you read me, Q?</i>
- I can hear you. I'm looking for you.

858
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:23,542
Got you. Tracking your location.

859
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:28,380
<i>Just keep moving forward. Enter
the next service door on your right.</i>

861
01:30:35,222 --> 01:30:37,223
If you're through that door,
you should be in the Tube.

862
01:30:38,016 --> 01:30:39,475
I'm in the Tube.

863
01:30:41,103 --> 01:30:44,146
Bond, this isn't an escape.
This was years in the planning.

864
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:46,857
<i>He wanted us to capture him,
he wanted us to access his computer.</i>

865
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:48,567
<i>It was all planned.</i>

866
01:30:48,652 --> 01:30:52,196
Blowing up HQ.
Knowing the emergency protocols.

867
01:30:52,322 --> 01:30:54,031
Knowing we'd retreat down here.

868
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:58,536
I've got all that. It's what he's
got planned next that worries me.

869
01:30:59,037 --> 01:31:02,081
District Line is the closest.
There's a service door on your left.

870
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:04,792
Got it.

871
01:31:08,547 --> 01:31:09,713
It won't open.

872
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,090
Of course it will.
Put your back into it.

873
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:13,634
Why don't you come down here
and put your back into it?

874
01:31:17,389 --> 01:31:19,014
No, it's stuck.

875
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:22,393
Oh, good. There's a train coming.

876
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:29,233
Hmm. That's vexing.

877
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:43,539
I'm through.

878
01:31:44,374 --> 01:31:45,875
Told you.

879
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:47,960
We alerted security.
Police are on their way.

880
01:32:25,498 --> 01:32:26,790
Where are you now?

881
01:32:26,917 --> 01:32:29,960
Temple Tube station.
Along with half of London.

883
01:32:34,758 --> 01:32:36,091
Oh, I see you. There you are.

884
01:32:36,676 --> 01:32:40,346
I know where I am, Q.
Where's he?

885
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:42,431
<i>Give us a second. I'm looking for him.</i>

886
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:44,016
Mind the gap.

887
01:32:50,941 --> 01:32:52,816
There's too many people. I can't see him.

888
01:32:53,068 --> 01:32:57,321
Welcome to rush hour on the Tube.
Not something you'd know much about.

890
01:32:57,822 --> 01:32:59,907
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

891
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:11,540
- The train's leaving. Do I get on the train?
<i>- Don't get on.</i>

892
01:33:12,103 --> 01:33:14,213
I'm not sure he's on it.
Give us a minute.

893
01:33:17,008 --> 01:33:18,050
<i>Do I get on the train?</i>

894
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:26,976
- Bond. - <i>What?</i>
- Get on the train!

896
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:42,741
He's keen to get home.

897
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:44,994
Will you open the door, please?

898
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:49,581
Open the door.

899
01:33:52,669 --> 01:33:54,753
Health and Safety.
Carry on.

900
01:34:01,553 --> 01:34:04,763
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- Take a wild guess, Q.

902
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:07,558
<i>He's in disguise, dressed as a policeman.</i>

903
01:34:07,726 --> 01:34:09,184
Of course he is.

904
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:33,000
Where's he going?
Where's he going?

905
01:34:40,425 --> 01:34:43,218
He's going for M. Tell Tanner.
Get her out of there.

906
01:34:43,636 --> 01:34:47,097
You've overlooked, or chosen
to ignore, hard evidence...

907
01:34:47,974 --> 01:34:53,520
...and consistently, almost obstinately...
- Silva's escaped. Bond's in pursuit.

909
01:34:53,813 --> 01:34:56,357
We need to get you to a secure
location immediately.

910
01:34:56,483 --> 01:34:58,359
I'll be damned
if I'm gonna show her my back.

911
01:34:59,069 --> 01:35:04,490
- Are we straining your attention?
- No. Please, Minister, proceed.

913
01:35:12,791 --> 01:35:13,999
Excuse me.

914
01:35:32,602 --> 01:35:33,644
Move! Move!

915
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:41,336
It's as if you insist on pretending
we still live in a golden age of espionage...

917
01:36:41,713 --> 01:36:44,298
...where human intelligence
was the only resource available.

918
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:49,553
Well, I find this rather old-fashioned belief
demonstrates a reckless disregard for...

920
01:36:49,721 --> 01:36:51,972
Excuse me, Minister,
I don't mean to interrupt...

921
01:36:52,056 --> 01:36:56,643
...but just for the sake of variety,
might we actually hear from the witness?

923
01:36:58,646 --> 01:36:59,897
Of course.

924
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:04,359
Thank you.

925
01:37:29,719 --> 01:37:30,719
Oh!

926
01:37:33,014 --> 01:37:34,765
I won't miss next time, Mr. Silva.

927
01:37:35,225 --> 01:37:38,602
Not bad. Not bad, James,
for a physical wreck.

928
01:37:39,103 --> 01:37:42,606
- Oi. Thank you.
- You caught me.

930
01:37:44,526 --> 01:37:47,444
Now... here's your prize.

931
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:51,114
The latest thing from my local toy store.

932
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:53,784
It's called radio.

933
01:37:58,748 --> 01:37:59,748
Whew!

934
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:05,796
- I do hope that wasn't for me.
- No.

936
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:07,756
But that is.

937
01:38:59,183 --> 01:39:00,517
M: <i>Chairman, Ministers.</i>

938
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:05,522
M: <i>Today I've repeatedly heard
how irrelevant my department has become.</i>

940
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:09,860
Why do we need agents? The Double-O section?
Isn't it all rather quaint?

942
01:39:11,696 --> 01:39:14,489
Well, I suppose I see
a different world than you do.

943
01:39:16,034 --> 01:39:19,202
And the truth is that
what I see frightens me.

944
01:39:21,164 --> 01:39:23,000
<i>I'm frightened because our enemies...</i>

945
01:39:23,427 --> 01:39:27,419
...are no longer known to us.
They do not exist on a map.

946
01:39:27,503 --> 01:39:30,005
They're not nations.
They are individuals.

947
01:39:33,259 --> 01:39:34,843
Look around you.
Who do you fear?

948
01:39:36,012 --> 01:39:38,722
<i>Can you see a face?
A uniform? A flag? No.</i>

949
01:39:40,058 --> 01:39:42,225
<i>Our world is not more transparent now.</i>

950
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:45,729
It's more opaque.
It's in the shadows.

952
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:49,232
That's where we must do battle.

953
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:53,320
So, before you declare us irrelevant,
ask yourselves...

954
01:39:54,739 --> 01:39:57,199
...how safe do you feel?

955
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:03,497
I've just one more thing to say.

956
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:06,583
My late husband was a great lover of poetry.

957
01:40:06,834 --> 01:40:08,168
And, um...

958
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:12,589
I suppose some of it sunk in,
despite my best intentions.

959
01:40:13,424 --> 01:40:17,761
<i>And here today I remember this,
I think from Tennyson:</i>

960
01:40:20,223 --> 01:40:26,436
<i>"We are not now that strength,
which in old days moved earth and heaven;"</i>

962
01:40:27,855 --> 01:40:30,107
"That which we are, we are;"

963
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:33,944
<i>"One equal temper of heroic hearts..."</i>

964
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:39,116
"...made weak by time and fate."

966
01:40:39,951 --> 01:40:41,952
<i>"But strong in will..."</i>

967
01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:44,246
"...to strive, to seek..."

968
01:40:45,081 --> 01:40:46,581
<i>"...to find..."</i>

969
01:40:46,874 --> 01:40:48,917
"...and not to yield."

970
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:13,376
- Go, go, go, go!
- Move!

972
01:42:13,836 --> 01:42:15,378
Move! Go! Move!

973
01:42:55,837 --> 01:42:58,922
007, what the hell are we doing?
Are you kidnapping me?

974
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:00,757
That would be one way of looking at it.

975
01:43:03,845 --> 01:43:06,012
Too many people are dying because of me.

976
01:43:06,264 --> 01:43:08,431
If he wants you,
he'll have to come and get you.

977
01:43:08,558 --> 01:43:10,976
We've been one step behind Silva
from the start.

978
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:13,228
It's time to get out in front,
change the game.

979
01:43:14,188 --> 01:43:15,397
And I'm to be the bait?

980
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:21,570
All right.
But just us. No one else.

981
01:43:22,955 --> 01:43:23,812
Q?

982
01:43:24,182 --> 01:43:27,386
<i>- I need help.</i> - I'm tracking the car.
Where are you going?

983
01:43:27,438 --> 01:43:28,250
<i>I've got M.</i>

983
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:29,733
We're about to disappear.

984
01:43:30,285 --> 01:43:31,123
What?

985
01:43:31,455 --> 01:43:33,623
I need you to lay a trail of breadcrumbs
impossible to follow...

986
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:35,959
...for anyone except Silva.
Think you can do it?

987
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,880
I'm guessing this isn't strictly official.

988
01:43:39,964 --> 01:43:41,131
Not even remotely.

989
01:43:41,424 --> 01:43:44,342
So much for my promising career in espionage.

990
01:43:53,102 --> 01:43:55,562
I'm not hiding in there,
if that's your brilliant plan.

991
01:43:55,563 --> 01:43:57,355
We're changing vehicles.

992
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:01,610
Trouble with company cars
is they have trackers.

993
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:14,247
Oh, and I suppose
that's completely inconspicuous.

994
01:44:14,999 --> 01:44:16,124
Get in.

995
01:44:38,981 --> 01:44:40,857
It's not very comfortable, is it?

996
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:44,861
Are you gonna complain the whole way?

997
01:44:44,987 --> 01:44:47,030
Oh, go on then, eject me.
See if I care.

998
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:51,326
Where are we going?

999
01:44:53,245 --> 01:44:54,537
Back in time.

1000
01:44:55,623 --> 01:44:57,958
Somewhere we'll have the advantage.

1001
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:01,169
It's a fine line.

1002
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:03,797
Make the breadcrumb too small
and he might miss it.

1003
01:45:04,048 --> 01:45:06,132
Too big and Silva will smell a rat.

1004
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:08,885
But do you think even Silva
will be able to spot that?

1005
01:45:09,637 --> 01:45:11,513
He's the only one who could.

1006
01:45:13,891 --> 01:45:15,016
Sir.

1007
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:17,560
Oh.

1008
01:45:18,062 --> 01:45:20,730
- What are you doing?
- We're just... monitoring.

1010
01:45:20,856 --> 01:45:23,483
Creating a false tracking signal
for Silva to follow.

1011
01:45:24,402 --> 01:45:26,319
Well, sir, um... Well, no.

1012
01:45:26,529 --> 01:45:28,405
Excellent thinking.
Get him isolated.

1013
01:45:28,572 --> 01:45:30,490
Send him on the A9.
It's the direct route.

1014
01:45:30,574 --> 01:45:32,742
You can monitor his progress
more accurately...

1015
01:45:32,868 --> 01:45:34,703
...and confirm it with the traffic cameras.

1016
01:45:34,912 --> 01:45:36,955
But what if the PM finds out?

1017
01:45:38,249 --> 01:45:39,874
Then we're all buggered.

1018
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:41,918
Carry on.

1019
01:46:24,211 --> 01:46:26,046
Is this where you grew up?

1020
01:46:26,714 --> 01:46:27,714
Mm.

1021
01:46:30,301 --> 01:46:32,177
How old were you when they died?

1022
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:37,974
You know the answer to that.

1023
01:46:40,311 --> 01:46:42,437
You know the whole story.

1024
01:46:50,279 --> 01:46:52,906
Orphans always make the best recruits.

1025
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:00,663
Storm's coming.

1026
01:48:00,683 --> 01:48:01,850
Christ.

1027
01:48:01,934 --> 01:48:02,934
Mm-hmm.

1028
01:48:04,478 --> 01:48:06,521
No wonder you never came back.

1029
01:49:00,284 --> 01:49:03,703
James. James Bond.

1031
01:49:03,954 --> 01:49:04,954
Good God.

1032
01:49:06,707 --> 01:49:08,082
Are you still alive?

1033
01:49:09,793 --> 01:49:11,544
It's nice to see you, too.

1034
01:49:13,923 --> 01:49:16,299
M, this is Kincade.

1035
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,635
Gamekeeper here since I was a boy.

1036
01:49:19,136 --> 01:49:21,471
- Pleased to meet you, Emma.
- Mr. Kincade.

1038
01:49:23,432 --> 01:49:26,559
You're a tad late. They've sold the place
when they thought you were dead.

1040
01:49:26,644 --> 01:49:28,311
It seems they were wrong.

1041
01:49:29,605 --> 01:49:32,982
- What are you doing here?
- Some men are coming to kill us.

1043
01:49:34,652 --> 01:49:35,818
But we're gonna kill them first.

1044
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:39,239
Then we'd better get ready.

1045
01:49:41,617 --> 01:49:43,243
Do we still have a gun room?

1046
01:49:43,994 --> 01:49:44,994
Ah.

1047
01:49:46,956 --> 01:49:51,334
They sold the lot to a collector
from Idaho or some such place.

1048
01:49:51,794 --> 01:49:53,920
They were shipped out weeks ago.

1049
01:49:54,463 --> 01:50:00,009
There's just... your father's old hunting rifle.

1051
01:50:01,136 --> 01:50:02,971
We couldn't let that go.

1052
01:50:08,936 --> 01:50:10,353
And this is what we've got.

1053
01:50:12,022 --> 01:50:15,024
There might be a couple of sticks
of dynamite from the quarry.

1054
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:17,694
But if all else fails...

1055
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:22,365
...sometimes the old ways are the best.

1056
01:50:28,372 --> 01:50:30,873
So who is it we're supposed to be fighting?

1057
01:50:31,208 --> 01:50:35,628
No "we" in it, Kincade.
This is not your fight.

1059
01:50:35,713 --> 01:50:38,881
Try and stop me,
you jumped-up little shit.

1060
01:50:40,509 --> 01:50:43,928
Now, remember what I taught you.
Don't let it pull to the left.

1061
01:50:45,389 --> 01:50:47,223
I'll do my best.

1062
01:50:55,983 --> 01:50:57,942
What did you say you did for a living?

1063
01:51:13,667 --> 01:51:14,959
Emma!

1064
01:51:15,753 --> 01:51:17,378
I brought you some things.

1065
01:51:20,591 --> 01:51:25,178
- The nights get cold here.
- Thank you, Mr. Kincade.

1067
01:51:26,597 --> 01:51:28,806
- It's a beautiful old house.
- She is.

1069
01:51:29,767 --> 01:51:34,687
And like all great ladies,
she still has her secret ways.

1070
01:51:35,189 --> 01:51:36,314
Let me show you this.

1071
01:51:41,612 --> 01:51:45,448
- Priest's hole?
- Yeah, from Reformation times.

1073
01:51:45,949 --> 01:51:48,117
The tunnel leads under the moor.

1074
01:51:48,243 --> 01:51:50,411
If you get in danger,
this is the place to come.

1075
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:56,376
The night I told him his parents had died,
he hid in here for two days.

1076
01:51:58,796 --> 01:51:59,962
When he did come out...

1077
01:52:00,631 --> 01:52:02,298
...he wasn't a boy anymore.

1078
01:52:03,842 --> 01:52:06,094
Eh. Must get on.

1079
01:54:06,507 --> 01:54:08,424
I fucked this up, didn't I?

1080
01:54:10,135 --> 01:54:11,302
No.

1081
01:54:13,222 --> 01:54:14,931
You did your job.

1082
01:54:20,062 --> 01:54:21,729
I read your obituary of me.

1083
01:54:23,482 --> 01:54:25,900
- And?
- Appalling.

1085
01:54:26,735 --> 01:54:28,236
Yeah, I knew you'd hate it.

1086
01:54:30,364 --> 01:54:32,865
I did call you "an exemplar of British fortitude".

1087
01:54:33,742 --> 01:54:35,409
That bit was all right.

1088
01:54:40,624 --> 01:54:41,749
You ready?

1089
01:54:42,334 --> 01:54:45,419
I was ready before you were born, son.

1090
01:56:04,708 --> 01:56:06,208
Welcome to Scotland.

1091
01:57:23,078 --> 01:57:24,120
You dropped something?

1092
01:57:50,647 --> 01:57:51,689
You hurt?

1093
01:57:52,566 --> 01:57:54,900
Only my pride.
I never was a good shot.

1094
01:58:00,907 --> 01:58:03,868
He's not here.

1095
01:58:38,403 --> 01:58:40,237
Always got to make an entrance.

1096
01:58:41,823 --> 01:58:43,866
You two, go to the kitchen. Now!

1097
01:59:08,058 --> 01:59:09,058
Get behind the arch!

1098
01:59:52,519 --> 01:59:54,061
Go to the chapel.
Use the tunnel.

1099
02:01:15,977 --> 02:01:20,189
Everyone, listen to me!
Don't you dare touch her. She's mine.

1100
02:01:37,207 --> 02:01:38,540
Can your friend come out and say hello?

1101
02:02:46,526 --> 02:02:48,610
Come on. This way.

1102
02:03:46,461 --> 02:03:48,504
I always hated this place.

1103
02:03:58,890 --> 02:04:00,349
Are you getting warm?

1104
02:05:29,314 --> 02:05:31,481
Just make sure Bond's dead!

1105
02:05:34,861 --> 02:05:37,070
Now it's me and her.

1106
02:07:35,189 --> 02:07:38,650
You see what comes of all this
running around, Mr. Bond?

1107
02:07:39,819 --> 02:07:42,070
All this jumping and fighting.

1108
02:07:42,238 --> 02:07:44,114
It's exhausting!

1109
02:07:47,285 --> 02:07:48,744
Relax.

1110
02:07:50,413 --> 02:07:52,164
You need to relax.

1111
02:08:10,975 --> 02:08:13,769
Ah, well... Mother's calling.

1112
02:08:15,396 --> 02:08:17,522
I'll give her a goodbye kiss for you.

1113
02:08:36,918 --> 02:08:38,960
Oh, my God.

1114
02:10:36,621 --> 02:10:38,497
Of course.

1115
02:10:38,915 --> 02:10:40,540
It had to be here.

1116
02:10:42,919 --> 02:10:44,544
It had to be this way.

1117
02:10:46,005 --> 02:10:47,464
Thank you.

1118
02:10:47,590 --> 02:10:49,299
- I can't find it no...
- Don't.

1119
02:10:53,262 --> 02:10:55,847
Please. Don't.

1120
02:11:11,155 --> 02:11:13,573
You're hurt... You're hurt!

1121
02:11:17,828 --> 02:11:22,415
What have they done to you?

1122
02:11:54,907 --> 02:11:56,449
Free both of us.

1123
02:11:56,909 --> 02:11:58,618
Free both of us...

1124
02:11:59,954 --> 02:12:01,204
...with the same bullet.

1125
02:12:02,957 --> 02:12:05,834
Do it.

1126
02:12:07,962 --> 02:12:09,170
Only you can do it.

1127
02:12:09,964 --> 02:12:11,214
Do it.

1128
02:12:27,023 --> 02:12:28,273
Ah!

1129
02:12:54,216 --> 02:12:56,009
Last rat standing.

1130
02:13:06,270 --> 02:13:09,272
007. What took you so long?

1131
02:13:09,565 --> 02:13:12,525
Well, I got into some deep water.

1132
02:13:14,445 --> 02:13:15,445
Oh!

1133
02:13:28,542 --> 02:13:30,627
I suppose it's...

1134
02:13:31,045 --> 02:13:33,380
...too late to make a run for it?

1135
02:13:39,553 --> 02:13:41,471
Well, I'm game if you are.

1136
02:13:51,899 --> 02:13:54,234
I did get one thing right.

1137
02:15:18,527 --> 02:15:19,778
Wow.

1138
02:15:21,030 --> 02:15:23,198
I didn't even know you could come up here.

1139
02:15:24,533 --> 02:15:28,453
- Hate to waste a view.
- I can see why.

1141
02:15:30,247 --> 02:15:33,124
I thought you were going back
out on active service.

1142
02:15:34,627 --> 02:15:36,419
I declined.

1143
02:15:38,088 --> 02:15:41,800
You said it yourself,
fieldwork's not for everyone.

1145
02:15:42,760 --> 02:15:45,637
If it helps, I feel a lot safer.

1146
02:15:50,935 --> 02:15:52,811
Her will was read today.

1147
02:15:53,729 --> 02:15:55,230
She left you this.

1148
02:16:07,493 --> 02:16:10,370
Maybe it was her way of telling you
to take a desk job.

1149
02:16:11,247 --> 02:16:12,997
Just the opposite.

1150
02:16:16,210 --> 02:16:17,502
Thank you.

1151
02:16:36,438 --> 02:16:38,982
You know, we've never formally
been introduced.

1152
02:16:42,653 --> 02:16:46,322
Well, my name's Eve.
Eve Moneypenny.

1154
02:16:47,283 --> 02:16:49,868
Well, I look forward to our time together,
Miss Moneypenny.

1155
02:16:50,369 --> 02:16:54,539
Me, too. I'm sure we'll have
one or two close shaves.

1156
02:16:56,917 --> 02:16:59,127
- Morning, 007.
- Good morning, Tanner.

1158
02:16:59,545 --> 02:17:00,545
He'll see you now.

1159
02:17:15,978 --> 02:17:17,312
How's the arm, sir?

1160
02:17:17,980 --> 02:17:20,440
What? Oh, it's fine.

1161
02:17:20,566 --> 02:17:21,816
It'll get better.

1162
02:17:21,942 --> 02:17:24,819
All pretty shocking for someone
unused to fieldwork.

1163
02:17:27,823 --> 02:17:31,326
So, 007... Lots to be done.

1164
02:17:35,497 --> 02:17:37,415
Are you ready to get back to work?

1165
02:17:39,335 --> 02:17:41,419
With pleasure, M.

1166
02:17:43,672 --> 02:17:45,673
With pleasure.

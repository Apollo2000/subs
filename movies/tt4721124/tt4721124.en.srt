2
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,290
I have to go.

3
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,966
Here.

4
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,811
Can I see you again?

5
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,360
One telegram from the War Ministry
is enough.

6
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,441
Brandt.

7
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,296
<i>What do you know about the Kaiser?</i>

8
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,848
<i>Kaiser Wilhelm II,
former Emperor of the Fatherland.</i>

9
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,241
<i>Weak leader. Poor strategist.</i>

10
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,209
<i>Led us to defeat.
Ran away afterwards.</i>

11
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,282
- Exiled in Belgium, sir.
- Holland.

12
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,762
- Is he still alive?
- Damn your ignorance, Captain.

13
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,330
The Kaiser is absolutely still alive

14
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,840
and remains of great symbolic importance
to the German people.

15
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,125
You're to take immediate command

16
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,409
of Kaiser Wilhelm's military guard
outside Utrecht.

17
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,565
As of now, the safety of the Kaiser is
of prime concern to the <i>Reich,</i>

18
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,962
and, therefore, also to you.

19
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,805
General, I wish to inform, I am now fit
for active service.

20
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,521
Don't push your luck, Captain.

21
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,524
After that business
with the SS in Poland,

22
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,881
- you were lucky to avoid a court martial.
- Yes, sir.

23
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,169
- This posting is a great honor.
- Yes, General.

24
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,163
Thank you, General.

25
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,164
General, if the Kaiser's in Holland,

26
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,730
how am I supposed to guard him?

27
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,891
At dawn this morning, our forces invaded
Belgium and the Netherlands.

28
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,201
The <i>Führer</i> thinks of everything.

29
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,407
Brandt. Eighth Infantry.

30
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,610
I am Colonel Sigurd von Ilsemann,
aide-de-camp to the Kaiser.

31
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,808
My orders are to assume immediate
command

32
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,803
of the Kaiser's personal bodyguards.

33
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,008
A captain?

34
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,004
All the majors are busy, sir.

35
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,682
The Dutch army guard have deserted.

36
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,536
Your men will take their billet
in the stables.

37
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,696
- I'll need a command post.
- I'm in charge of the household.

38
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,801
Within the grounds.

39
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,090
The female staff
are not to be interfered with.

40
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,083
Look forward to working with you, Colonel.

41
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,527
Wilhelm!

42
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,527
Wilhelm!

43
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,841
They're here.

44
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,164
- The army, your army.
- No. No. Not mine.

45
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,129
They have been sent to protect you.

46
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,204
That in itself
is not without significance.

47
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,410
In return, it is <i>vital</i> to make
the right impression.

48
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,170
Oh? On whom?

49
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,206
Our friends in Berlin have been constantly
active on your behalf.

50
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,244
The army want you back.
They always have.

51
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,360
The stage is set.
Every detail matters.

52
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,688
We must invite
the commanding officer to dinner.

53
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,366
So now we're running a restaurant?

54
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,764
- He will be watching us.
- Yes, perhaps. From outside.

55
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,522
Wilhelm, do you want
your throne back or not?

56
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,365
You are the Kaiser.

57
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,604
Secure the perimeter.
Get this place cleaned up.

58
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,081
- We have to go faster.
- Move it! Move it! Move it!

59
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,647
I'm looking for
Gestapo Inspector Dietrich.

60
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,768
All these boxes get in the building.

61
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,686
Inspector Dietrich, I'm Brandt.

62
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,001
I was expecting you yesterday.

63
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,801
Apologies. My orders were to report
upon arrival. No time was specified.

64
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,280
- What can I do for you, Inspector?
- The Kaiser.

65
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,204
The former Kaiser.

66
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,601
The Gestapo keeps extensive files
on this individual,

67
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,364
but they are not up to date.

68
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,563
As part of your duties here,
you will compile a detailed report.

69
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,725
In particular, his attitudes towards
the <i>Reich</i> and its leaders,

70
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,121
anything he says
about the war and its conduct,

71
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,720
noting also significant omissions,

72
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,725
such as failure to agree with statements
made in favor of the <i>Reich</i> and so on.

73
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,451
You expect me to spy on him?

74
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,649
You'll also keep a list of all visitors,
noting the duration of their stay.

75
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,167
- Is that really necessary?
- Ah.

76
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,211
You think because he is old,
he is unimportant?

77
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,966
The British Secret Service
have an agent in the area.

78
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,567
We picked up coded radio
transmissions from the vicinity.

79
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,291
It could be a kidnap attempt
or, most likely, an assassination.

80
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,967
What's the point of killing an old man
that's been out of power for 20 years?

81
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,611
Personally, I couldn't care less.

82
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,567
He is everything that was wrong
with old Germany.

83
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,929
Where was he
while we were all starving?

84
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,408
If anything happens to him, Captain,
you'll be shot.

85
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,847
And I will do it.

86
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,723
<i>Did you read
the SS file on him?</i>

87
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,724
Hard to believe he wasn't executed.

88
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,243
He must have friends in Berlin.

89
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,448
Brussels fell to our forces yesterday

90
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,330
and airborne troops have secured
the border with France.

91
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,244
Holland is now
almost completely occupied,

92
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,120
- barring some unofficial resistance.
- It's unnecessary.

93
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,931
Strategically irrelevant for now
and a waste of resources.

94
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,445
I mean, invading Holland!

95
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,047
Further south, armored divisions
are through the Ardennes forest,

96
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,168
in behind the Maginot Line.

97
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,484
Forgive me, Your Highness.
I was told you have coffee at this time.

98
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,726
You're new.

99
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,642
- Yes, Your Highness.
- No need to be alarmed.

100
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,051
What's your name?

101
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,283
- Mieke, Your Highness.
- Dutch?

102
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,442
- Yes, Your Highness.
- I see.

103
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,048
Well, tell me, child,
would you have invaded Holland?

104
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,161
What?

105
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,322
If you had been in command
of the German army,

106
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,607
would you have invaded Holland?

107
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,762
Why, yes, Your Highness. Of course.

108
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,482
I see. And what precisely
is your military objective?

109
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,643
- Well, it's very nice.
- What is?

110
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,728
Holland.

111
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,811
Goddamn, Sigurd. She's better
than half the General Staff!

112
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,244
We will expect you
at tomorrow's briefing!

113
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,931
Yes, Your Highness.

114
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,882
She's the one my wife has been
complaining about, I suppose.

115
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,203
You know, I don't mind telling you,

116
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,568
if I was a hundred years younger...

117
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,086
Oh, never mind.

118
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,045
You know, Sigurd, I've been thinking.

119
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,404
Tonight we'll have fish.

120
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,044
The Kaiser presents his compliments.

121
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,004
He would be pleased if you'd join him
at dinner tomorrow night.

122
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,964
Take your clothes off.

123
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,281
Please.

124
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,686
Gently.

125
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,449
Please...

126
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,961
tell the Kaiser I would be honored
to accept his invitation.

127
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,841
There.

128
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,691
Fuck it.

129
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,171
Your Highness.

130
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,687
May I take that, Captain?

131
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,330
Thank you.

132
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,162
- You stink of schnapps.
- We need to speak.

133
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,811
Not now. You're late. He's waiting.

134
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,928
You'll address him as sir,
and his wife as madame.

135
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,844
The Treaty of Versailles forbids
any other form of address.

136
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,083
His left arm is slightly deformed.
You will not refer to it or look at it.

137
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,605
You will speak only when spoken to

138
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,728
and all discussion of politics
is forbidden.

139
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,725
Express no opinion of your own,
agree with his, and remember...

140
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,885
At the age of four, he bit
the Duke of Edinburgh in the leg.

141
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,967
Captain Brandt, Prince Friedrich Wilhelm
Viktor Albrecht von Preussen

142
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,601
and his wife,
Princess Hermine Reuss von Greiz.

143
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,162
Your Highness. Your Highness.

144
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,725
We are both so pleased
that you could join us, Captain.

145
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,566
<i>...that I have always found
so fascinating.</i>

146
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,602
<i>I published a book on the subject
in 1934. You will have seen it.</i>

147
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,685
For example, there are some people
who actually believe

148
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,809
that Adolf Hitler invented the swastika.

149
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,327
Utter nonsense.
The word comes from the Sanskrit.

150
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,004
It means "well-being,"

151
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,085
and the earliest examples date
from the Indus Valley,

152
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,130
3,000 years before Christ.

153
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,204
Oh, yes. In many religions, it's...

154
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,046
it is a symbol of life,
of good fortune.

155
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,442
Not that it has brought much to me.

156
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,200
And yet we must accept

157
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,648
that God has imposed
these terrible trials on us

158
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,441
for some inscrutable purpose of His own.

159
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,811
Oh, these books they're writing, my God!

160
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,327
They just dump bucketloads of filth
on my head

161
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,131
and nobody does anything.

162
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,767
Bismarck would have had
something to say on the subject.

163
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,286
But then he had something
to say on every subject,

164
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,681
which is why I got rid of him.

165
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:47,530
His servants would pull
the wine corks in front of you.

166
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,571
But I must say the old boy knew
how to deal with troublemakers.

167
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,008
Freemasons, Bolsheviks, Jews.

168
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,084
The unholy alliance
that we have to face.

169
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,485
Which is exactly why
a strong monarchy,

170
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,360
the physical manifestation
of God's will on earth,

171
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,240
is more vital now than ever.

172
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,322
Tell us a little about yourself, Captain.
Where's your family from?

173
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,528
Brandenburg, Your Highness.

174
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,522
My grandfather was an army officer,

175
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,369
as was my father.

176
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,967
He was killed on the Somme
just before I was born.

177
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,570
- And your mother?
- From a landowning family.

178
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,008
- Really? Which one?
- Related to the Ludendorffs.

179
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,686
- Oh.
- Distantly.

180
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,163
After the war, of course,
she had to clean houses.

181
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,564
I remember helping her
wheel her wages home in a barrow.

182
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,731
Of course, by the time we got
to the bakery, it was worthless.

183
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,929
- She died of tuberculosis when I was 12.
- Mm-hmm.

184
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,204
Am I to blame for every misfortune
on this earth?

185
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,202
I gave my life to the Fatherland!

186
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,727
And this is my thanks?!

187
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,929
Nobody cares my navy betrayed me!

188
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,685
Nobody remembers my army fell apart.

189
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,808
Ludendorff, Bethmann, Tirpitz!

190
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,486
Where were they? Where were they?
Where were they?!

191
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,729
After all I've done for them,

192
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,724
they stabbed me in the back.

193
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,246
They lost me the war!

194
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,924
They lost me my country.

195
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:19,090
I ask forgiveness for unintentionally
upsetting His Highness.

196
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,208
His earlier remark about the fuhrer

197
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,408
was simply a correction of fact,
you understand?

198
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,845
In no way a criticism.

199
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,483
The trout was first rate.

200
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,251
Hmm.

201
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,760
How did you get in?

202
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,446
Take your clothes off.

203
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,562
Will there be anything else,
Your Highness?

204
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,891
No, thank you, Sigurd.
There will be absolutely nothing.

205
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,481
Wait.

206
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,162
Stay. Stay the night.

207
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,964
- Good morning, Your Highness.
- Huh!

208
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,522
I had a visit just now
from Captain Brandt.

209
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,928
He tells me the British
have an agent active in this area.

210
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,163
It is his opinion that this agent
may wish you harm.

211
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,561
An agent?

212
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,768
We must alert the ducks.

213
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,004
He therefore requests that he move
into the house immediately.

214
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,361
What do you think of him,
our Captain Brandt?

215
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,402
He is a typical, cocky young officer,

216
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,164
who thinks he can win the war
on his own.

217
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,366
Does he remind you of anyone, Sigurd?

218
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,886
Not at all.

219
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,891
Are you ready for your daily briefing,
Your Highness?

220
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,329
I think I will give it a miss.

221
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:35,325
I have something
much more important to do.

222
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,085
He is not himself.

223
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,243
But I expect great news any day now.

224
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,561
We must never lose hope.

225
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,803
It is the hope which is killing him.

226
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,724
Of course, I shall say nothing for now.

227
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,770
Until then, we must just keep
his spirits up.

228
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,765
Ahem.

229
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,207
- Oh.
- Forgive me, Your Highness.

230
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,921
Colonel von Ilsemann sent me out
with more bread.

231
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,571
Oh, did he now?
That was very good of him. Ha!

232
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,041
- For the ducks.
- Oh, for the ducks, of course.

233
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,565
It's a bit early for my lunch.

234
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,120
No, why don't <i>you</i> feed them?

235
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,481
You have beautiful hands.

236
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:52,243
You are quite unused
to physical labor, no?

237
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,688
War changes everything.

238
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,841
<i>Ja.</i>

239
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:03,766
What do you think of ducks, child?
Hmm? I'm very fond of them.

240
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,162
They're beautiful creatures,
and they ask for so little.

241
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,050
A duck will never blame you
for his troubles

242
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,567
or force you to abdicate your throne.

243
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:20,964
I know you miss it terribly,
and yet, what a dreadful burden.

244
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,329
You're right. And it was.

245
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,164
Captain. Captain!

246
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,166
Your Highness.

247
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,729
I hear there's a British spy after me.

248
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,056
You'll be quite safe, Your Highness.

249
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,844
Oh...

250
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:43,608
Sigurd tells me that you fought
in Poland last year.

251
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:48,129
My grandson, Oscar, was killed
at the front there.

252
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,089
Perhaps you knew?

253
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,051
No. No, Your Highness. I... I didn't.
Please accept my sympathies.

254
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,728
Last September. Hmm.
You must come to dinner again.

255
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,605
Tell me all about it. Er...

256
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:09,769
Why don't you, er, show the captain
his new rooms at the house?

257
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,926
Of course, Your Highness.

258
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,764
My name is Stefan.
I was wondering what yours was.

259
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,642
De Jong. Mieke de Jong.

260
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,922
May I call you Mieke?

261
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,490
It would be better if you didn't.

262
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,202
Copulation is strictly forbidden
among the staff.

263
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,126
I would lose my position.
You might lose yours.

264
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,725
Where's your room?

265
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,922
On the other side of the staircase.
The last on the right.

266
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,280
They told me you were up here.

267
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,044
Nice place. Very comfy.

268
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,963
What can I do for you,
Inspector?

269
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,327
There was another transmission
last night.

270
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,448
At the moment, we only have
the one detector truck,

271
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,490
but there's a chance
it's coming from the village.

272
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,770
We're getting a second truck soon,
and then we will find the exact location.

273
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,811
- Soon?
- How's your report coming?

274
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,202
Fuck. I wouldn't mind
pulling her in for questioning.

275
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:48,770
You know, they say the Dutch women
are as sex-mad as the French.

276
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,320
I'm sure your <i>Reich</i> Marks
will be welcome anywhere.

277
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,925
- What?
- In the meantime,

278
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,049
perhaps you should spend less time
lusting after servant girls

279
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,044
and more finding
a second detector truck.

280
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,648
Ah! You've marked her out
for yourself, have you?

281
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,088
Copulation is strictly forbidden
among the staff.

282
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,889
Goodbye, Inspector.

283
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,290
Anyone might think
you were spying on me, Captain.

284
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,727
Forgive me, Your Highness.

285
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,725
What are you doing
creeping around in the woods?

286
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,280
If anything happens to you,
Your Highness, I'll be shot.

287
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,330
Oh, it's good to know they still care.

288
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,285
Walk with me.

289
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,926
Tell me about Poland.
Your first action?

290
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,604
Yes, Your Highness.

291
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,842
What you expected?

292
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,922
I expected to die.

293
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,764
Come on!

294
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,040
- They know there's a British agent here.
- Who knows?

295
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,849
The army captain guarding the Kaiser.

296
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,241
And the Gestapo turned up
at the house today.

297
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,166
If they knew any more than that,
you'd have been arrested by now

298
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,603
- When can you do it?
- I need more time.

299
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,001
- You may not have it.
- I know that.

300
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,284
As soon as you feel it's safe, do it.

301
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,126
Then we'll get you out.

302
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,961
Be careful.

303
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,880
What are you doing?

304
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,725
I wanted to see you.

305
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,406
I'm on duty now. They're calling me.

306
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:34,210
There's a Gestapo officer,
Dietrich, in Utrecht.

307
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,487
What about him?

308
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,801
If he bothers you at all, tell me.

309
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,211
I'll deal with it.

310
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,770
It seems the General Staff has
learnt from its mistakes of last time.

311
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,320
Wouldn't you say, huh, child?

312
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,606
On the whole, Your Highness.

313
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,130
Although, they may find
the infernal machinery,

314
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,410
<i>la machine infernale,</i>
harder to stop than to start.

315
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,883
I never wanted the last war, you know.

316
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:19,205
But there are still people who don't...
who don't seem to realize that.

317
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,727
Of course,
the Serbs were a crowd of thugs.

318
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,689
They still are.

319
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,560
But I told the Austrians,

320
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,326
"You got what you wanted.
Stop in Belgrade!"

321
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,082
I wrote a telegram to Vienna,
"Stop in Belgrade!"

322
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,088
They never sent it.

323
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,240
Bethmann, Moltke,
they wanted the war, you see.

324
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,763
It was never sent.
They made sure of that.

325
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,569
Yes, Your Highness.

326
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,041
My voice...
my voice was a lone voice.

327
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,856
- Perhaps... perhaps, Your Highness,
- What could I do? What could I do?

328
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,647
The Captain would like to see
your collection of military uniforms.

329
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,569
Yes, yes, go on.

330
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,645
He was still the Kaiser.

331
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,485
He could have sent
another fucking telegram.

332
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,283
Any progress catching the spy?

333
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,806
They're waiting
for another signal truck.

334
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,489
Your family.

335
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,483
- My family, Your Highness?
- Are they all right?

336
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,441
If there's anything I can do for them,
you must let me know.

337
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,127
- These are difficult times.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

338
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,282
Your Highness...

339
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,521
What is it?

340
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,363
You're very kind, Your Highness.
Good night.

341
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,160
- Was that girl asking for money?
- No, I...

342
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,926
I believe I was inquiring
about her family.

343
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,650
Perhaps I dreamed it.

344
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,722
Well, I don't like her manner.

345
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,521
If it weren't for the shortage,
I would certainly let her go.

346
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,241
I suppose it's part of your duties
to read this stuff?

347
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,846
- You're ignorant.
- I know.

348
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:21,489
Mieke, I wanted to apologize for how I was
the first time we met.

349
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,726
Met?

350
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,286
You know what I mean.

351
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,171
I wanted you.

352
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,691
It's somewhere in the village.

353
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,046
We'll get him next time.

354
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,407
So, how did you get
your Iron Cross Second Class?

355
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,244
I survived in a second class way.

356
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,170
And the scars?

357
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,330
Shrapnel.

358
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,922
Most of it's still in there.

359
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,411
It hurts you.

360
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,642
Is that why you're stuck here
and not at the front?

361
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,005
I'm here because I follow orders.

362
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,448
Do you always follow orders?

363
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,760
What else is there?

364
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,124
I'm Jewish.

365
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,446
I'm not.

366
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,160
Obviously.

367
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,287
I don't care.

368
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,850
One day, you might have to.

369
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,324
One day, we'll be dead.

370
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,608
You have bad dreams.

371
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,566
You have someone, somewhere?

372
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,362
If I did, you wouldn't be here.

373
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,522
And you, Captain?
No girl anywhere?

374
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,131
If I did, I'd still be here.

375
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,724
You have to go.

376
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,840
What you told me about yourself...

377
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,486
don't tell anyone else.

378
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,723
You're up early, Inspector.

379
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,531
The transmitter's right in the village.

380
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,967
If he doesn't signal tonight,
we'll go in and search.

381
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,571
Hmm.

382
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,363
But that's not why I'm here.

383
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:44,323
The old man is getting a visit
tomorrow, from the head of the SS.

384
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,882
- Himmler's coming here?
- You catch on quick.

385
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,284
He'll have dinner, then we'll take him
back to a secret location.

386
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,448
- I'll notify the household.
- No, you won't.

387
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,727
You can tell the old man,
but no one else.

388
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,451
I'm handling his security,
so we'll be searching the house today.

389
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,443
I'll need a list of all the staff.

390
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,656
And what do I tell them?
They're bound to ask questions.

391
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,685
Oh, their job is to answer them.
I'll be back in an hour.

392
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,005
Captain Brandt requests
a private audience.

393
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,684
Hmm.

394
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,603
Your Highness,
what I have to tell you

395
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,576
is top secret and must remain
strictly between us.

396
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,170
Wilhelm! Oh, Captain.

397
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,368
Have you heard the news?

398
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,602
<i>Reichsführer</i> of the SS,
Heinrich Himmler,

399
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,684
is coming to dinner tomorrow night.
Isn't that marvelous?

400
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,569
I just received a telegram from Berlin.

401
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,281
One can only hope that he has
better manners than that oaf, Goering.

402
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,885
It is a pity that his wife is not able
to join him, but still...

403
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,088
Oh, we have a million things to do!

404
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,448
He came here a few years back,
fat Goering.

405
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,490
You never knew
if he was a boy or a girl.

406
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,530
And he came down to lunch in plus fours.

407
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,927
Plus fours!

408
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,606
My old regiment would have set
the dogs on him.

409
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,201
My husband is always joking.

410
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,648
You must have a great deal
to do today, Captain,

411
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,371
so we mustn't keep you
a moment longer.

412
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,884
Better start counting the silver.

413
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,121
Wilhelm!

414
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,282
I regret to inform you the Gestapo

415
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,016
will be making a thorough search
of the house

416
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,724
before the <i>Reichsführer's</i> visit.

417
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:44,045
And may I say, between us,
it would be better if the Kaiser

418
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:48,762
didn't air certain opinions
in front of the Gestapo.

419
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,923
Inspector Dietrich
has no sense of humor.

420
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,530
Oh, Colonel?

421
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,761
Do you keep guns in the house?

422
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,081
Of course. His Highness shoots.

423
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,482
- And who cleans them?
- The guns? The footmen.

424
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,722
Hmm. Not the maids?

425
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,167
No, of course not the maids. Why?

426
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,651
Thank you.

427
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,961
At ease. Ready?

428
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,687
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

429
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,240
You must pay no attention
to my husband's jokes.

430
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,290
You know, there is nobody
more loyal to the <i>führer.</i>

431
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,044
Please.

432
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,325
Now, this visit tomorrow
is of the utmost significance.

433
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,250
It is, of course, well-known,
among those who know,

434
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,362
that Himmler is Hitler's
right-hand man.

435
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,046
One hears that Goering
isn't quite so trusted.

436
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,487
Although it is due to my efforts
in that direction,

437
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,164
I shall say no more,

438
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,130
that the government continues
to pay our allowance,

439
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,124
which Wilhelm doesn't seem
to understand,

440
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,441
could be taken away at any moment.

441
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,603
But, before the last war, of course,
he was the richest man in Germany,

442
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,002
so I'm afraid he has
very little idea of money.

443
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,764
The purpose of this visit

444
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:17,609
can only be to propose in some form
the restoration of the monarchy.

445
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,609
Oh, the fuhrer has done
very well so far, of course.

446
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,331
But it is obvious that,
in this time of crisis,

447
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,165
Germany needs its king.

448
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,487
A man of wisdom and experience,

449
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,642
who can ensure
the allegiance of the Church,

450
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,520
- the aristocracy, and the armed forces.
- Hmm.

451
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:40,207
I myself have been using what little
influence I have in Berlin.

452
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,248
Oh, I shall say no more.

453
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:46,564
But I am delighted
that my efforts have borne fruit.

454
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,531
It was for Germany that I acted,
of course.

455
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,600
Certainly not for the pleasure
of seeing my sisters

456
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,206
- bowing and scraping in front of me.
- Hmm.

457
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,443
Do you know, I am not sure I shall even
receive them in court.

458
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,166
They treated me very shabbily
when I was young.

459
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:09,524
Captain, as head of the Kaiser's
personal bodyguard,

460
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,080
<i>Herr</i> Himmler will surely want
your impressions.

461
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,408
May I hope
you will give a positive account

462
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,529
of our humble and loyal household?

463
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,568
- Of course, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Captain

464
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,211
- I was certain I could rely on you.
- If you'll excuse me.

465
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,964
- Yes.
<i>- Everyone knows.</i>

466
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,930
- Hmm?
- Kaiser's wife got a telegram.

467
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,968
I'll find out who sent it.

468
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,247
May I suggest my men start
at the top, work down'?

469
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,810
You come up from the bottom.

470
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,009
Yes, that's just
what I was going to suggest.

471
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:47,761
<i>It's a madhouse.</i>

472
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,411
It's a damned madhouse!

473
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,926
Who do they think they are?
Who do they think I am?

474
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,931
You should never have permitted it!

475
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,764
Send me the damned girl!

476
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,971
Take a room each.

477
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:16,724
Be respectful of personal property,
but thorough.

478
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,246
I'll start at the far end.

479
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,531
You know, my Uncle Friedrich
once told me

480
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:46,242
that a one-armed man
should never be King in Prussia.

481
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:51,281
"I'll show you," I thought,
"you miserable swine."

482
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:58,170
The old bastard died
just before I came to the throne.

483
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,000
I always thought
he did it on purpose.

484
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,250
By the way, are you courting?

485
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,930
Courting?

486
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,927
No. Well, not exactly, Your Highness.
I mean, there is someone.

487
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,402
Oh, of course there is.

488
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,323
Do you love him?

489
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,448
No, I... I hardly know him.

490
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,607
You know, my... the first girl
I ever loved, her name was Ella.

491
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:33,809
We had the same grandmother,
Queen Victoria of England,

492
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,848
on her mother's side and on mine.

493
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,207
But Ella...

494
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:43,650
Oh, she was gorgeous.

495
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,884
Of course, she knew it.

496
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,442
I went down on my knees
one summer evening

497
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,921
and begged her to be my wife.

498
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,527
Instead, she married a Romanov.

499
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,444
Butchered by Bolsheviks
in a mine shaft.

500
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:04,570
"That'll teach her," I thought.

501
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,010
So...

502
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,847
the moral of this story is...

503
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,488
Be careful what you wish for.

504
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:21,647
And, as they say, seize the day.

505
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,366
Yes, definitely do that.

506
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,444
- Finished?
- For now.

507
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,763
- You look happy.
- Of course.

508
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,765
Here am I,
a butcher's son from Munich,

509
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,128
tearing the Kaiser's palace
upside down.

510
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,890
That is what National Socialism
has done for Germany.

511
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,326
Staff files from von Ilsemann.

512
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,691
- What do you think of him?
- He's harmless.

513
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,286
- I don't like him.
- You don't like anyone.

514
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,600
Hmm.

515
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,329
We'll be back...

516
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,970
tomorrow.

517
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,568
Get it refueled.

518
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,530
Himmler's coming to the house
tomorrow.

519
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,171
Himmler? The head of the SS?

520
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,801
He'll arrive in the afternoon,
and he'll stay for dinner.

521
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,929
- I can kill him.
- No, that's not our mission.

522
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,209
Well, tell London.
They might change it.

523
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,884
No, it would be suicide!

524
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,529
The SS murdered my father
and my husband.

525
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,807
- You're not here to avenge your family.
- Tell London.

526
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,884
Tell them I'm ready.
Tell them I'll do it.

527
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,411
Oh, my God.

528
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,926
Oh, Mieke.

529
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,728
I'll come to the house.

530
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,691
And I'll give you the answer
tomorrow.

531
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,005
Let's go!

532
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,366
Sorry.

533
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,608
I can go, if you want.

534
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,287
No.

535
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:19,891
Stay.

536
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,241
Shh.

537
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,405
What is it this time?

538
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,245
<i>Poland.</i>

539
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,371
<i>A village of women and children.</i>

540
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,847
<i>They'd been machine-gunned by the SS.</i>

541
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,240
<i>It was a beautiful day.</i>

542
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,525
And I thought...

543
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,331
"God made this.

544
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,085
God made all of it."

545
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,162
<i>There was a girl.</i>

546
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,242
<i>She was still alive.</i>

547
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,886
<i>I tried to help her, but she died.</i>

548
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,929
I beat the officer senseless
in front of his unit.

549
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:08,046
It's men like that, they shame the SS.
They shame us all.

550
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:12,603
But they are not the exception,
they are the rule.

551
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,967
I don't believe that.

552
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,443
I have to go.

553
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:31,087
- Will you marry me?
- What?

554
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,527
Marry me, Mieke. Now. Today.

555
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,802
- Are you serious?
- Completely.

556
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,450
But I'm a Jewess.

557
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,330
- I'll protect you.
- No!

558
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,209
Nobody can.

559
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,891
I will do my duty.

560
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,365
Everyone must.

561
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:10,727
You never stop. You're always there.

562
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,165
Ah.

563
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:27,646
Why is he coming, Sigurd? Why?

564
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,171
Not to see my uniforms.

565
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,129
Is it possible?

566
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,327
After all this time?

567
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:52,284
I dare not hope. I cannot.

568
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,688
Certainly it would make
the Empress exceedingly happy.

569
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,966
A small price to pay.

570
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:03,045
Sigurd, I have to be
at this morning's briefings.

571
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,401
I must be up to date for our visitors.

572
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,848
- Your Highness.
- What?!

573
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:13,926
Wilhelm, I am sorry to involve you
in this sordid affair.

574
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,288
This disgrace also involves the head
of your personal bodyguard,

575
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,930
whom you'll wish to dismiss yourself.

576
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,446
What precisely is the nature
of this scandal?

577
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,969
This girl has been caught in flagrante
in this officer's bedroom.

578
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:29,010
And <i>Frau</i> Linnenkamp swears
it is not the first time.

579
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,367
Your Highness,
I am entirely to blame.

580
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:34,927
That this should come to light on the very
day that <i>Herr</i> Himmler is to visit!

581
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,968
God forbid that he should hear of it!

582
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,522
You are dismissed.
Go and pack your effects immediately.

583
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,126
Now, just a moment.

584
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,444
Nobody's going anywhere.

585
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:52,048
I will speak to the captain and the girl.

586
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,442
In private.

587
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,056
I'm not sure you understand.

588
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,845
They have been caught fornicating
under our roof.

589
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,287
This girl is no better
than a common slut.

590
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,886
This officer has disgraced his uniform.

591
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,200
<i>Your</i> uniform.

592
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:12,605
I may not rule in Germany,
but, by Christ, I rule in my own house!

593
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,082
This is him, I hope?

594
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,926
- Of course, Your Highness.
- Well!

595
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,325
I am ashamed to say that before and after
my first marriage,

596
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,564
I myself fathered
at least two illegitimate children.

597
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:09,202
One with an Austrian Countess,
another with a French prostitute,

598
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:13,524
who was known in court circles
as "Madame I'Amour."

599
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,729
Both, incidentally, blackmailed me
for huge sums of money,

600
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,007
the Countess and the prostitute.

601
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:22,129
I expected better of the prostitute.

602
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:27,091
Now, I have many vices.

603
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,651
Hypocrisy is not one of them.

604
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:38,051
So you will resume your duties,
but this time...

605
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,643
you will be more discreet.

606
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,651
Thank you, Your Highness.

607
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,122
His Highness will see you now.

608
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,321
Telephone message for you, Captain.

609
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:29,651
- You sent for me?
- I've got something to show you.

610
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,444
It was the fucking pastor!

611
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,443
We found the radio set and everything.

612
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:39,649
Dirksen knocked him clean out last night,
or we would have started sooner.

613
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,405
Still, we should have
everything we need by tonight.

614
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,889
Good work, Inspector.

615
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,123
I'm sorry I could not count
on your support this morning, Sigurd.

616
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,409
And furthermore, your attitude
since the news of <i>Herr</i> Himmler's visit

617
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:38,370
is far from what I might have hoped.

618
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,603
I long for the restoration of the monarchy
as much as you do.

619
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:46,969
And yet I fear this meeting carries
with it a very grave risk.

620
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:51,248
- What are you talking about, Sigurd?
- The Kaiser's temper is short.

621
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:54,927
Should Himmler provoke him to rage,
as Goering so very nearly did,

622
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,764
His Highness could lose everything.

623
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:02,370
Not only the annual allowance they so
generously grant him, but his life.

624
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,728
The Night of the Long Knives taught us
who and what they are.

625
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,451
The <i>Führer</i> simply dealt
with a few Jews and Communists.

626
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:13,845
The former Chancellor and his wife,
gunned down in their own home.

627
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,844
Nobody is safe, not even you.

628
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:23,530
Then you must make sure
he is not provoked,

629
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:27,241
mustn't you, Colonel?

630
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,930
Your Highness.

631
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,089
Captain?

632
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,602
He's here. He's here!

633
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,966
Mm-hmm.

634
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:48,806
Attention!

635
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:23,330
<i>Herr Reichsführer,</i>
I am Sigurd von Ilsemann.

636
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,722
- Welcome to Huis Doorn.
- <i>Heil Hitler.</i>

637
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,402
May I present Captain Brandt
of the Eighth Infantry Regiment?

638
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,926
- He commands the army here.
- Captain.

639
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:55,004
May I present
Prince Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor...

640
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:56,161
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

641
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:04,405
<i>Herr Reichsführer,</i>
welcome to our humble home.

642
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,201
We are delighted you could spare
the time from your innumerable duties

643
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,487
and we are only sorry your dear wife

644
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:14,246
is unable to come with you
on this occasion.

645
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,840
You will, we hope, allow us,

646
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:20,447
as representatives
of the Hohenzollern dynasty

647
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:24,206
and the royal house of Prussia,
to congratulate you and the <i>Führer</i>

648
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:28,046
on the latest of your astounding series
of great victories.

649
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:31,283
The National Socialist
Democratic Workers' Party

650
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:34,887
thanks you for your kind words
and your loyal support.

651
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,890
May I show you to your rooms?

652
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:45,487
Thank you.
It's been a tiring journey.

653
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:57,961
May I request, before dinner,
the pleasure of a private audience?

654
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:01,283
That is to say,
a meeting on matters of State.

655
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,010
I shall arrange it.

656
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,651
- I need to see you.
- Not now.

657
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,768
Yes, now!

658
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:24,287
No, we were told to be discreet.

659
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:27,091
The pastor's been arrested
by the Gestapo.

660
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:28,969
They're interrogating him now.

661
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,520
Soon he'll tell them
everything he knows.

662
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,736
- Why do you tell me this?
- Why did you sleep with me?

663
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,376
- Why did you ask me?
- Were you following orders?

664
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,528
No, it was a mistake, a madness.

665
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,968
- You used me!
- I used myself.

666
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,440
If you wanted to kill him,
you could have done that any time.

667
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,209
- I'll scream the house down!
- Oh, you will when Dietrich starts.

668
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,441
- How did you know?
- I saw you with him at the church.

669
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,321
And you're a Jew
who knows German army medals

670
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,483
and keeps gun oil hidden in her room.

671
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:11,849
Then, Captain, you must do your duty.

672
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,527
Just leave. Leave now.

673
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,721
- Please.
- I can't.

674
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:27,885
Do you expect me to betray my oath,
my country, for you?

675
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:32,761
I expected nothing from you,
Captain.

676
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:36,970
You must do your duty.
And I will do mine.

677
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,401
Forgive me, <i>Herr Reichsführer.</i>

678
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,764
What can I do for you?

679
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:47,490
This is for you, <i>Herr Reichsführer.</i>

680
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,403
I'm sure a man in your position

681
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:54,168
must have so many unforeseen expenses
in your positions...

682
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,607
It can be so difficult
to make ends meet.

683
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:59,889
Certainly,
I know in my own household...

684
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,765
servants, oh, they are so expensive,
especially in wartime.

685
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,326
So difficult to keep.

686
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,323
Thank you.

687
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,650
Oh!

688
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,251
Here you are!

689
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:23,891
I was worried.
It's almost time for dinner.

690
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,601
Wilhelm?

691
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:39,207
It seems we are to go back to Berlin.

692
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,171
If we choose.

693
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,163
Can that be true?

694
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,682
You are to be king again?

695
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,360
I'm afraid I'm going to need
a new wardrobe.

696
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:11,290
For now, I think we should keep this
to ourselves.

697
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,521
Mm.

698
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,168
<i>Oh, my dear</i> Frau <i>Linnenkamp.</i>

699
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:22,969
First thing tomorrow,
I shall say no more,

700
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,249
we must start packing the house.

701
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:31,361
<i>Your Highness.</i>

702
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:37,360
May I be the first
to offer my congratulations?

703
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,488
Oh.

704
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,446
I know we both had reservations
about these people

705
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,967
and all the people in power, but...

706
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:51,610
Yet I believe that both they
and the German people

707
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:57,608
can only benefit from a firm
and Christian presence on the throne.

708
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:59,449
A restraining influence.

709
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:05,048
Perhaps God has not forgotten me
after all.

710
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,411
Make yourself at home.

711
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,926
- Some of us weren't invited to dinner.
- Ah.

712
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,364
So much for National Socialism.

713
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,167
Has the pastor talked yet?

714
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:31,607
I just called them.
It won't be long.

715
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,691
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

716
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,125
At ease, gentlemen.

717
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,880
Is that schnapps, by any chance?

718
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,681
This will go no further.

719
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:02,884
I have just told the former Kaiser
that the <i>Führer</i> has,

720
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:07,648
under strict conditions,
and for the good of the Fatherland,

721
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:11,611
agreed to bring him back from exile
to take up his throne once more in Berlin.

722
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:22,006
I have to tell you now
that this is a deception.

723
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,847
Its aim is to flush out any remaining
monarchist sympathizers, in the <i>Reich.</i>

724
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,285
You two will work together

725
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:35,729
to intercept any communications
in and out of the house.

726
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:36,926
When messengers are sent,

727
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,844
you'll find out where where they
come from or where they're going,

728
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,730
and report directly to my office
in Berlin.

729
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,649
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

730
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,805
Any questions?

731
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:53,720
Good.

732
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,962
Captain. Thank you.

733
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:19,521
He's holding out. For now.

734
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,404
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

735
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,729
I'm starving.

736
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,366
We'll take a break
until he comes round again.

737
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,601
<i>The Americans
will stay out this time.</i>

738
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:49,846
They are decadent people,

739
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,400
no fonder of the Jews
and Communists than we are.

740
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,921
Now, there I disagree with you.

741
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,801
We face an international conspiracy
funded by Jewish capital

742
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,962
which has its home in America.

743
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,526
It will have to be defeated
sooner or later.

744
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,170
I'm glad to hear you say that.

745
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,891
You had 30 years to do something
about the Jews.

746
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:14,242
And yet, you just let them
get on with it.

747
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,731
We had other priorities.

748
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:20,168
But you had Jewish friends, didn't you?
I'm sure I read that.

749
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:24,522
In the last war, the German Jews fought
and died for our country

750
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,762
- in their hundreds of thousands.
- What's your point?

751
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:27,921
I think it's fair to say

752
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,209
that few people really understood
the Jewish threat until the '20s.

753
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,647
And for that we are very grateful
to the <i>Führer.</i>

754
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,722
Of course, the problem
is the same everywhere,

755
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:39,122
but only now, in Germany, is there
sufficient clarity of thought

756
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:42,807
to admit the scale of the task
and to examine the potential solutions

757
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:46,248
in a thorough and an imaginative manner.

758
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:50,370
And yet, where we lead
I'm sure that others will follow.

759
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:53,683
It's obvious Germany needs more room
for its people, especially in the east,

760
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:57,401
and for that there will have to be a
certain re-ordering of other populations.

761
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:01,565
And where relocation is impractical,
a more sensible solution must be found.

762
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:03,688
The elderly, the crippled,
the mentally ill

763
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,848
are simply a drain
on the <i>Reich's</i> resources.

764
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:09,686
- Not to mention the children, of course.
- Well, indeed.

765
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,762
In wartime, it is hardly feasible
to feed them

766
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:15,640
until they can provide
the return on capital.

767
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:18,849
And we are very much
at the experimental stage.

768
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:22,925
I attended one demonstration recently
at the laboratory in Potsdam

769
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:27,688
where ten disabled children were
each given a red balloon to play with,

770
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,845
and then injected in the heart
with a solution of concentrated phenol.

771
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,809
- I beg your pardon?
- Phenol.

772
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:41,249
You probably know it as carbolic acid.
It's easily soluble.

773
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:43,536
The children look as if they have passed
away in their sleep,

774
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:46,928
but the doctor and his assistant,
who are both very skilled,

775
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,083
could only manage ten in a minute.

776
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:53,881
So I fear it's hardly practical
on the scale we may eventually need.

777
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:14,404
Will you take some brandy
and a cigar, <i>Herr</i> Himmler?

778
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:19,601
Yes, yes!

779
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:26,689
Yes, and I will show you my collection
of P.G. Wodehouse first editions.

780
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:32,960
I'm afraid I must go.
I have an early start tomorrow.

781
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,923
We have an understanding, I think?

782
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,889
Indeed, we do.

783
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:13,128
Brandt, they are the rule.
You are the exception.

784
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,120
You let me know the minute the pastor
gives you anything.

785
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,640
Ah, good to see you finally
taking an interest, Brandt.

786
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:45,051
You were wonderful.

787
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,043
I was very proud of you.

788
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:35,249
You are a bloody fool, Sigurd.
You almost ruined everything.

789
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,925
Colonel.

790
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:52,210
I've been wondering something.

791
01:22:55,800 --> 01:23:00,886
Can an officer have a loyalty
to anything greater than his country?

792
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:07,361
First, he must answer the question...

793
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:12,366
"What is my country...

794
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:14,283
and does it even still exist?"

795
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,760
Hmm.

796
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,885
The offer His Highness received
tonight from Himmler...

797
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,849
It's a trap.

798
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:31,684
They want to know who secretly
supports the restoration.

799
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:37,650
I trust you will inform
His Highness accordingly.

800
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:43,004
If you'll excuse me.

801
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,121
Captain?

802
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,686
Thank you.

803
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,809
Is something wrong?

804
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:25,965
- I have to go now. Forever.
- Oh...

805
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,651
But first I...
I have a message for you.

806
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,082
From Winston Churchill.

807
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:44,247
Of course you do.

808
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,682
You're the secret agent.

809
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,926
Marvelous.

810
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:01,691
<i>Help!</i>

811
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:06,881
<i>Help!</i>

812
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:11,806
Help!

813
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,249
Help!

814
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:17,209
It's the Kaiser,
he's collapsed in the clearing!

815
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,123
No, get him to hospital now!

816
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:32,044
What happened? Is he dead?

817
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:33,770
We spoke and then I left.

818
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,888
I saw him pick up his axe
and he just fell.

819
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:38,201
- You should have gone hours ago.
- I know, I'll go now.

820
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:43,480
Brandt.

821
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,681
I'll find her.

822
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:55,651
Gestapo. They know.

823
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,160
They are coming for you now.
You'll never make it.

824
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,449
Mieke, trust me.

825
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,724
It's Brandt. Listen.

826
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,201
One of the female servants
is an enemy agent.

827
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:28,284
Get all the men out.
Seal off the exits and the perimeter.

828
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:31,603
And nobody, nobody gets in or out
of the grounds without my permission.

829
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,682
Clear?

830
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:49,967
I'm perfectly well.
Just a little dizzy, that's...

831
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:52,088
I'm fine now.
I'm fine now.

832
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:55,130
I'm all right, I'm all right.
Please, don't fuss!

833
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:59,250
I have told you so many times
not to exercise so after dinner.

834
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:04,121
I must remember that. Huh?

835
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,362
You... you won't believe...

836
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:12,163
I... I just received a message
from Britain's Prime Minister.

837
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:15,687
- The boy, Churchill.
- What? What message?

838
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:16,966
What?

839
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:19,884
He was offering me exile in England,

840
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:21,769
and then, when the war ends,

841
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:25,521
the throne of a defeated Germany.

842
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:29,251
Imagine that!
Two offers in one night.

843
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:31,926
Not bad, huh? After 20 years.

844
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,210
- Oh!
- Wilhelm, please, please rest.

845
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:37,645
Rest.

846
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:41,964
Of course, I was very polite.
I said, "No, thank you."

847
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:45,203
Of course. Please rest. Rest.

848
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:47,049
Sigurd will be here in a moment.

849
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:50,329
- Hermine.
- Hmm?

850
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,368
There's something I must tell you.

851
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:56,247
I shall not return to Berlin.

852
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:01,441
I shall stay here with you...

853
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:04,686
And I will never leave.

854
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:11,960
Was it tonight?
That dreadful man?

855
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:15,761
I should never have brought him here.
Oh, I am such a fool.

856
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:19,367
No, no, no!
Thank God, I'm grateful to you.

857
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:21,721
But they are not all like Himmler.

858
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:25,646
You will talk to the <i>Führer,</i>
and the man must be dismissed.

859
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:28,041
- Something must be done.
- No, nothing can be done.

860
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:32,887
No, they are not as we are,
as anyone is.

861
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:35,201
We had to know that, and now we do.

862
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:39,365
Oh! Look at me.

863
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,689
My love.

864
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:48,683
It's God's will. All of it.

865
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,167
No. How can that be?

866
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:57,048
And I'm content. I must be.

867
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:04,762
- Truly?
- Truly.

868
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:11,126
Then so am I.

869
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,805
It's that new servant girl.

870
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:51,281
- He has chest pains.
- Dr. Krahl is coming.

871
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,488
- Don't fuss, Sigurd. Don't fuss.
- Quick, help!

872
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,121
Careful.

873
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,202
- Don't...
- To the house.

874
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:02,284
- The doctor is coming.
- Don't fuss, Sigurd. Don't fuss.

875
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,089
- Careful.
- Yes. Yes.

876
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,242
Just put me to bed, that's all.

877
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:20,806
- Captain, open the door.
- He needs the hospital.

878
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:23,531
- Open the door!
- Brandt, the doctor is coming here.

879
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,602
- Follow me.
- Brandt!

880
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:30,881
But wait! I need to go with him!

881
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:59,441
Mieke. Mieke!

882
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,682
The Gestapo's coming for her.

883
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,649
Well, get her in. Quick!

884
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:21,731
Why did you wait so long?

885
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:25,441
Did you think I was going
to turn you over to the Gestapo?

886
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:28,000
Well, of course, that's exactly
what I should have done.

887
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:39,803
Halt!

888
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:42,042
Open the gate, damn you!

889
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,849
We're looking for an enemy agent.

890
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:46,605
Ah, so are we!
Open the fucking gate!

891
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:49,047
Oh, Christ. They're here already.

892
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,484
Mieke, give me your gun, now.

893
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:56,361
Mieke!

894
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:05,246
- Mueller, get that gate open.
- Sir.

895
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:11,610
Move that car out of the way now!

896
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:12,896
Where do you think you're going?

897
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:15,096
Hospital. The Kaiser's in the back,
he's had a heart attack.

898
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:19,091
- Our priority is the spy.
- Mine is his life.

899
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:20,216
They've sealed the perimeter.

900
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:22,641
Take my men and your cars
and start searching the house.

901
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:24,768
I'll be back in an hour.

902
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:27,609
Get them up to the house!

903
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:30,763
Oh, come along.
Move that fucking car!

904
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:32,524
Get moving!

905
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,607
- I'm checking the van.
- It's the Kaiser.

906
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:46,284
Get out of the way.

907
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:48,169
Ah, we'll just take a little look.

908
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:58,561
No!

909
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:29,121
Oh, Mieke.

910
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:49,247
You saved my life.

911
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:57,650
I'm glad we had the chance
to say goodbye.

912
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:02,361
I shall miss you.

913
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:16,647
Such beautiful hands.

914
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:28,762
Your Highness.

915
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:32,162
Your Highness?

916
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:33,969
Your Highness.

917
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,646
Brandt! Brandt!

918
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,762
He's just asleep.

919
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:15,081
- You've got somewhere to go?
- An address. Will you come with me?

920
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,800
I betrayed my country,
but I won't abandon it.

921
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:21,081
Oh, Brandt, please, you'll be shot!

922
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:23,322
I left two Gestapo officers
to guard the gate

923
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:26,051
and took the Kaiser to hospital.

924
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:27,680
The enemy agent killed them
and escaped.

925
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,405
Don't be sad.

926
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,043
I found something else to fight for.

927
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:49,411
Me too.

928
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:16,046
I...

929
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:21,520
I know.

930
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:33,046
But will you marry me?

931
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:43,044
Come and find me after the war.

932
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,881
Is that a yes?

933
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:49,565
Of course!

934
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:20,521
Has she gone?

935
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:32,885
Thank you.

936
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,729
From the Red Cross.

937
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:48,162
Your Highness, Captain Brandt
sent a message from Berlin.

938
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:52,560
He has good news.

939
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,889
Thank you, Sigurd.

940
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:00,684
Of course he has.

941
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:11,726
There you are.

942
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:14,007
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

943
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:15,889
The Prime Minister will see you now.

944
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:17,724
Oh...

945
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:19,404
Thank you.

945
01:40:20,305 --> 01:41:20,479

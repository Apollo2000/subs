<i>Reporter: It's day 7 of
the nationwide manhunt...</i>

3
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:21,453
For the death cult congregation
leader known as the reaper.

<i>This man has been...</i>

Female reporter ♪1: After a freak
power failure during the execution...

6
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:35,300
At central prison, the reaper escaped,
killing several police officers...

7
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:37,136
<i>And leaving multiple
wounded in his rampage.</i>

<i>Former ordained
minister, the reaper...</i>

Female reporter ♪2: So, professor, can
you tell us a little about the victims?

12
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:58,924
Professor well, the reaper's victims
were known to be convicted felons...

13
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:03,062
Prostitutes, drug dealers and
gang members and that sort.

14
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:13,839
<i>Of the victims, two have been decorated
officers under investigation...</i>

15
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:16,347
By internal affairs, involving a

department-wide investigation
into corruption.

<i>The governor has declared
a statewide dusk curfew.</i>

18

Reporter: What we can do, is to
advise people not to pick up...

19
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:43,335
Hitchhikers, stay indoors as much
as possible, and stay off the road.

Natalie: Hey, mom, it's me, Natalie.
I'm on my way with my friends.

<i>They're giving me a ride
all the way to California.</i>

<i>Don't worry, I'll stay away
from strangers. I promise.</i>

23
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:28,647
<i>See you soon. I love you.</i>

24
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,524
Hey, thanks for the lift.

25
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,259
Hey, come here often?

26
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:17,162
Yeah, they've got great... sand.

27
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:24,069
So, are you gonna be a
smartass or a gentleman?

28
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,637
What's the difference?

29
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:29,041
A gentleman would have just
opened my door right now.

30
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,509
This is either my lucky day...

31
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:34,379
Or you are gonna cause
me some serious trouble.

32
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,914
But be warned...

33
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:40,152
The air conditioner in this thing
is broken, so it's kind of hot.

34
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:43,755
Been drinking?

35
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:46,658
Only since I woke up.

36
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,728
Rum's really the best way
to the pass the time.

37
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,065
Well, I guess drinking in the morning makes
you more of a pirate than an alcoholic.

38
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:56,535
Arrgh! Let's plot a course.

39
00:03:56,537 --> 00:04:00,205
As far west as my captain
is willing to take me.

40
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,708
You got it.

41
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,152
So, what's your story?

42
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:17,556
Oh, are we gonna play the getting
to know each other game?

43
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:22,861
I like games. All
right, let's see here.

44
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:25,497
Searching or running?

45
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:29,568
Pretty girl like you hitchhiking
out here in the middle of nowhere.

46
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,105
I'm guessing you're either
running from your old life...

47
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:36,275
Or you're searching for
your new life, right?

48
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:41,980
Yeah, I kinda like me as I am.

49
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:44,316
Oh, no complaints here.

50
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:48,287
But that doesn't mean
you're telling the truth.

51
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:51,156
So how long have you
been a salesman for?

52
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,961
How did you know that?

53
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,630
Beat up company car, old suit...

54
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:02,100
And I'd bet you'd have a conversation
with a brick wall if you had to.

55
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:05,003
I sell air conditioners.

56
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,839
But your own ac doesn't work?

57
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:11,910
I, uh... in-home
air conditioners.

58
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,446
Sounds fun.

59
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,581
Oh, it is. It's a hoot.
I love it.

60
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:20,285
Driving from one crappy town
to the next crappy town...

61
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:24,856
Selling crappy ac units
to crappy people.

62
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,358
Well, it pays the bills.

63
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,196
Yes, it pays the bills.
Pays <i>the</i> bill. Me.

64
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,800
You got a name?

65
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:37,069
Sure do.

66
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:42,207
You gonna keep me guessing?

67
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:47,079
I'll give you a hint.
Sounds like "sheryl."

68
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:50,048
I like the sound of that.

69
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,389
Huh... maybe I should drive?

70
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,624
No, no, I got it, I got
it, kiddo, I got it.

71
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,609
Now where were we? I
was about to get out.

72
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,277
Now why would you
go and do that?

73
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,579
Because you almost
just killed us.

74
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,715
Relax, have a drink.

75
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:02,621
Man. Not again! I hate this.

76
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,122
What?

77
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:08,260
Car's overheating. That's
why I don't run the ac.

78
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,128
Well, can we at least
make it to the next stop?

79
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,231
You bet your ass
we're gonna try.

80
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,267
I saw a motel back there.

81
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,769
Maybe we'll turn around
and go check that out.

82
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:18,463
Car ought to cool down
in a couple minutes.

83
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,499
Great.

84
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,824
I've been driving
since before sun-up.

85
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:50,262
I don't know, I'm thinking I
might just call it for the day.

86
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:55,467
Okay, well I'm just gonna get out here
and go hitch a ride somewhere else.

87
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:58,069
No, no, wait, wait,
wait, whoa, whoa.

88
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:01,873
C'mon, don't tell me you're not
up for a little excitement.

89
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,342
Naw, dude. I have hit my excitement
quota for the year, thank you.

90
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,478
All right, look. How 'bout this?

91
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,769
Go inside, we'll have
a couple drinks and

92
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,082
mellow out, you know,
just chill for a minute.

93
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,351
You know, hit the reset button.
Decompress.

94
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:15,353
And then if you want to go, you can.
Totally.

95
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,355
I mean, look, how bad can it be?

96
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,457
There's a church right
across the street.

97
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:23,194
Bill, I am not the kind of
girl that you think I am.

98
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:26,531
I keep telling you,
it's not about <i>that.</i>

99
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:30,235
I'm just... I know that
you are low on the money.

100
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:34,472
And a hotel is here.

101
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:37,142
I'm not gonna sit here and
beg you to hang out with me.

102
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:44,683
You're... you're kind
of begging right now.

103
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,585
Come on.

104
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,317
Hello?

105
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,826
Anyone here?

106
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,733
What's the deal with
this place, man?

107
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:44,009
Hello? Brother and sister.

108
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:48,313
Oh, um... we're not related.

109
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:53,685
But you are here for relations.
Correct?

110
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:56,588
We, uh... we... we're newlyweds.

111
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,759
Do you, um, you got
any honeymoon suites?

112
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:03,028
They're all honeymoon suites.

113
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,396
I've been spraying them down...

114
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:07,032
And mopping them up for
the last 30 years.

115
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:08,600
Gross.

116
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:11,803
Well, at least they're clean.
We'll have one.

117
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,208
Cash.

118
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,779
Okay, cash. Okay. All right.

119
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,663
Have you surrendered your
will to the almighty?

120
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,131
Yeah.

121
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:44,269
Yeah. Yeah, man. We're practically,
uh, in church every day.

122
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:48,106
So room 7, right?

123
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:49,974
Of course.

124
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,976
Up the stairs?

125
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,946
Fantastic.

126
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:03,254
You have a coat check, sir?

127
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:04,856
Thanks.

128
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:10,195
Seven feasts. Seven sins.

129
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:12,831
Seven plagues to do you in.

130
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,900
He's still staring at us.

131
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:38,223
Ha, ho. Sorry, the
wind must have got it.

132
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:41,459
Yeah. Didn't mean to scare you.

133
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:47,065
I'm still, um... still just a
little stressed, that's all.

134
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:54,172
Well, you know, we can...
We can fix that.

135
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:58,943
Yeah, you know, we should,
uh, have a drink.

136
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,946
Yes, we should have a drink.
Mm-hmm.

137
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:06,351
For sure. Well, there's
glasses right here.

138
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:19,564
I'm not that kind of girl, but that
doesn't mean I'm not a little bad.

139
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:23,601
Well, you know a little
bad never hurt anybody.

140
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,245
L-let me go fix that. Yeah.

141
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,547
Mm-hm.

142
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:49,727
So, what are we
drinking to, sheryl?

143
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:53,565
Ah. To our honeymoon, bill.

144
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:56,467
Our honeymoon. Yes,
our honeymoon.

145
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,203
Yeah.

146
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:02,040
Hey. 'Til sunrise do us part.

147
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,811
Ah, yeah, mm...

148
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:11,049
Ah, yeah, it's... it's good.

149
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:12,450
So, are you still scared?

150
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:15,253
Ha. Slow down, tiger.

151
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,622
What do you mean, slow down?

152
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,524
I thought that we were
on our honeymoon.

153
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,160
Yeah, so, what's the rush?

154
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:26,497
No rush, but I mean, we're here.

155
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:30,235
I've been wanting to introduce you to
little bill ever since we first met.

156
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:31,369
Stop!

157
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,137
Whaddya mean "stop?"

158
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:37,275
Bill, stop! What is wrong with you.
Bill, please! Stop it!

159
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:38,810
We're on our honeymoon, right?

160
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:41,579
Bill! Stop or I'm out of here!

161
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,414
You're not going anywhere.

162
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,284
Stop it!

163
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:47,352
Bill! What?

164
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:49,254
Don't be an asshole!

165
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:51,823
Yeah, that's more like it.

166
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:53,191
You want me to take charge?

167
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:54,225
Yeah.

168
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,861
Yeah?

169
00:14:56,863 --> 00:15:00,198
How do you like that, huh?
Oh, yeah, bring it!

170
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,302
I'm gonna make you
bleed, Billy boy.

171
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:09,007
Oh! Ah! Ah! Hit me! Ah! Ah!

172
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:11,776
You like that?

173
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,378
More! Oh! Ah! You do?

174
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,146
Come on! Harder!

175
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,552
You like that?

176
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,791
Yeah, wait, wait.

177
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:30,895
Okay, you creep. Get up.

178
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,402
Ooh. I think I'm a little drunk.

179
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:40,071
Sit down. Okay.

180
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,839
Sit down!

181
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:44,842
What are you d... come on.

182
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:49,514
Oh! Yeah, all right. Tie me up!

183
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:51,482
Don't go anywhere.

184
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,858
Hey, there's no sex toys in there.
Come here.

185
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:08,199
Yes, yes. Yeah, get in there.

186
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:16,808
Hey. What are you...
What are you doing?

187
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,043
Oh, you've done this before.

188
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:22,213
You're right. I have
done this before.

189
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:24,749
That's not funny.

190
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,385
But it is... it is a
little funny, though.

191
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,287
Isn't it, bill?

192
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:34,525
The big, bad wolf slain by the
little damsel in distress.

193
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:38,029
A whole, new kind of fairy tale.

194
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:40,832
I feel like I'm gonna puke.

195
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,202
They're gonna find you.

196
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:47,305
I'm gonna tell the cops.
I'm gonna tell them.

197
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:51,175
I'm gonna tell them
that sheryl did this.

198
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:56,414
You know, baby, that would
work, if sheryl was my name.

199
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:02,186
It doesn't have to be like this.

200
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:06,457
You can give up now, and you won't...
be in trouble.

201
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,593
See ya, bill.

202
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:14,132
Sheryl, don't do this. Sheryl?

203
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,700
Oh, man!

204
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:06,284
Sheryl? That you?

205
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,533
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed by thy name.

206
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:27,071
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

207
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:30,842
Give us this day
our daily bread.

208
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:32,877
Forgive us our trespasses...

209
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:36,380
As we forgive those who
trespass against us.

210
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,483
Lead us not into temptation.

211
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:41,486
But deliver us from evil.

212
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:42,987
Amen.

213
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,923
<i>Mother: Hello?</i>

214
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:22,193
Hi, mom. <i>Natalie!
How are you, baby?</i>

215
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:25,285
Yeah, I'm good, um, we're
just stopping off at

216
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,399
the badlands for lunch
at this little diner.

217
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:32,436
It's going all right.
How are you?

218
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:35,873
I'm okay, baby, just surviving.

219
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,742
Well, what did the
doctors tell you?

220
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:45,183
<i>The doctor said there's a good chance the
surgery will help, but it's very expensive.</i>

221
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:48,719
<i>They need me to pay for it now
because of my bankruptcy.</i>

222
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:52,089
<i>It's okay, I'm strong...</i>

223
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:55,226
And we've always been a strong
family, just the two of us.

224
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:57,728
Well, you just
stay strong, okay?

225
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,130
I will, honey.

226
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:00,631
You do exactly what they say.

227
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,066
I am.

228
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:05,703
Hey, um, I have some money.
I'll bring it.

229
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,104
Enough to cover the operation.

230
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:08,606
No, Natalie, you don't have to.

231
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:13,077
I know that you don't
want it, but you need it.

232
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:16,447
<i>Oh, bless your heart, baby.
Thank you.</i>

233
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:19,584
Of course, anything for you.

234
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:23,521
Hey, well, I gotta go, so...
I'll be there, I promise.

235
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:26,490
<i>Okay, sweetie. I love you.</i>

236
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,526
I love you, too.

237
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,481
<i>Reporter: Breaking news today,
we have new developments...</i>

238
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:25,583
<i>In this ongoing story.</i>

239
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:29,253
<i>The ex-minister and convicted felon
now known as "the reaper"...</i>

240
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:31,522
<i>Has been sighted
in kings county...</i>

241
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:36,060
<i>The same city where he was convicted
for murder so many years ago.</i>

242
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:38,352
The reaper, after
surviving the electric

243
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:40,665
chair and escaping the
state penitentiary...

244
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:44,735
<i>Is believed to be hiding
in or around kings county.</i>

245
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,704
<i>The nightmare continues.</i>

246
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:49,707
<i>Police are investigating a missing
persons case in the area.</i>

247
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:53,277
Tammy Simmons, a known
prostitute, has gone missing...

248
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,180
<i>And the police believe the
reaper might be involved.</i>

249
00:21:56,182 --> 00:22:00,251
<i>Again, authorities are urging the people
of kings county to stay indoors...</i>

250
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:06,390
<i>And be cautious until the police are able
to apprehend the suspect. In other news...</i>

251
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:11,195
I'm all right.

252
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:28,579
Hi. What'll it be, sweetie?

253
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:32,183
Um, give me a piece of
that chocolate cake.

254
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,752
I'll get that warmed up for you.

255
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:37,121
Thank you.

256
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,666
There you go.

257
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,104
Thank you, darling.

258
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:55,272
Can I get you
anything else, Rob?

259
00:22:55,274 --> 00:23:00,144
No, darling. Just go and look after the
other customers like you're paid to.

260
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:03,481
Red meat'll kill ya.

261
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:05,116
Something's got you, my son...

262
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:09,153
I got Daisy may here
to watch my back.

263
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:11,355
I'm telling you,
man, go vegetarian.

264
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,090
Better for the
body and the soul.

265
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:16,994
Yeah. But I ain't got one.
Neither have you.

266
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:19,630
Better for the body, at least.

267
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:27,171
Now, here's a down payment.

268
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:29,106
That's for somebody else's soul.

269
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:32,910
Whoa, hey!

270
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,246
Now I think you owe me.

271
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,581
For all them other jobs
you keep screwing up.

272
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,816
Now what do you say?

273
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:41,118
Hey, hey, hey!

274
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,187
One finger for a down payment?

275
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:48,626
Hey, man, I'm an earner. I make money
for you. Don't you forget that.

276
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:53,230
Good point. And that's
why you're above ground.

277
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:57,635
Now, show me the stuff.

278
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:09,246
Blue pill, blue pill.

279
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:15,453
That don't taste like I'm
screwing up now, does it, Rob?

280
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:20,057
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
That is nuclear.

281
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,126
That's right.

282
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,462
Now get me the rest.

283
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:26,597
This is... this is not
enough to close the deal.

284
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:31,135
Listen. You make the deal,
or I'll make you squeal.

285
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:35,873
That how you sweet
talk ol' Daisy may?

286
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:39,276
Just remember, Daisy may has
got a soft spot for you.

287
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:42,780
Don't let her down. Fellas.

288
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:05,636
Rough day, cowboy?

289
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:07,204
Well, I'll tell you
something, darling.

290
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:10,574
Bull riding would have been
a lot easier than this.

291
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:14,144
Come here, I got a little
something to show you.

292
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,519
Between us, okay?

293
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:23,454
Rob is not gonna like this.

294
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,423
Oh, ho, ho, he doesn't
have to know, darling.

295
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:28,325
I'm not for sale.

296
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:30,828
Everybody is, sweetheart.
Everybody.

297
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:34,632
How do you like your coffee?

298
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:40,371
Hot, sweet, and sometimes
with a shot of amaretto.

299
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:54,685
So, when are you going to take
me on that long, overdue ride?

300
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:58,255
Excuse me, can I pay for
that chocolate cake?

301
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:02,293
Yeah, sure.

302
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,464
Here you go.

303
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:09,633
You can keep the change.

304
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:12,202
Thank you.

305
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:23,881
What were we talking about again?
Darling?

306
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:49,807
What the... hell?

307
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:55,646
Oh, perfect!

308
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:58,449
Freaking perfect.

309
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:14,431
Whoa! Oh!

310
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:15,833
Oh, my god, are you okay?

311
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:21,805
You freaking worthless...
I mean, yeah, you okay?

312
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,107
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

313
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:26,110
My heart is racing, but... I
don't know what happened.

314
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:27,411
My foot must have just slipped.

315
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:31,882
Yeah, that happens sometimes.
Yeah.

316
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:35,219
Well, that sucks about your car.

317
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:40,591
Either pure bad luck, or I must
have really pissed somebody off.

318
00:27:40,593 --> 00:27:45,396
Do you want a ride? I mean, I did
almost just kind of kill you.

319
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:47,731
That you did.

320
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:51,802
Unfortunately, I don't
take rides from strangers.

321
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,006
Okay.

322
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:03,647
I'm Sarah.

323
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:07,818
Brad.

324
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:12,389
I guess this means we're not
strangers anymore, now does it?

325
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:14,958
Hop in, Brad.

326
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:30,207
So, where you headed?

327
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,810
Your guess is as good as mine.

328
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:34,178
No, really?

329
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,879
Well, I was heading
to a meeting.

330
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,048
It's actually not
too far from here.

331
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,316
Hmm.

332
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:42,086
So, what were you
doing at Rob's diner?

333
00:28:42,088 --> 00:28:45,823
I was on a date.

334
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:47,424
And how did that go?

335
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:50,561
It didn't. He stood me up.

336
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:54,031
Well, <i>he</i> is an idiot.

337
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:56,533
You're sweet.

338
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:58,268
Just being nice to my driver.

339
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:02,639
This way I don't have to
give you much of a tip.

340
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:06,610
And a gentleman, too.

341
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:11,381
So, um, what is it that you do?

342
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:13,484
I buy and sell stuff.

343
00:29:13,486 --> 00:29:15,419
What kind of stuff?

344
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,287
The profitable kind.

345
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:20,023
Hey, would you pull over at
that mini mart over there?

346
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,764
And make a right here.

347
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,748
Well, thank you.

348
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,950
Of course.

349
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,623
You know, um...

350
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:58,562
My mom used to say that with every
sunset comes a new beginning.

351
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:01,465
So that's what
you're looking for.

352
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,801
Isn't that what we're
all looking for?

353
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:16,780
If, ha, if I was to kiss you...
Mm-hm.

354
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:20,851
It would not be in a
mini mart parking lot.

355
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:24,454
Sarah, we just met.

356
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:26,857
I don't know what kind
of girl you think I am.

357
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:30,093
Well, hopefully no
kind of girl at all.

358
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:32,162
But if we were...

359
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,697
If we were...

360
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:36,767
Going to kiss... Mm-hm.

361
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:39,169
At a different location.

362
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,904
Yeah, umm...

363
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:45,809
Is there anything
that you might want?

364
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:50,814
Uhh, something fermented.
And lots of it.

365
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:52,109
Sorry, honey. But it's
all about the money.

366
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:21,138
No, no, no!

367
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,843
Oh, come on, come on...

368
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:36,453
Oh, oh. Oh, my... really?

369
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,155
Really.

370
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:46,063
Oh... great.

371
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,670
Perfect. Perfect!

372
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,964
Hey.

373
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:23,333
Looks like you got trouble.

374
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:26,703
Yeah, that's the, uh,
horoscope of the day.

375
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:28,305
Is that your car?

376
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:33,777
Yeah, it's stolen. I'm not, um...
ex-boyfriend.

377
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:36,413
Jerk, you know?

378
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:39,583
Yeah, I've seen it on the road,
he's a real piece of work.

379
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:40,951
Yeah.

380
00:33:40,953 --> 00:33:43,854
So, uh, do you think
you could fix it?

381
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,622
You know what, sweetheart?
I just drive them.

382
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:47,391
I don't work on them. Oh, yeah.

383
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:48,525
Where you headed?

384
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:51,795
West. Away from him.

385
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:55,599
West. Okay, you know
you're headed east?

386
00:33:55,601 --> 00:34:00,303
Ha, well, um, I do now.

387
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:02,606
Look, you're not gonna get a
tow out here 'til tomorrow.

388
00:34:02,608 --> 00:34:04,141
You want a lift?

389
00:34:04,143 --> 00:34:07,778
Naw, it's... it's all right.
Thanks, though.

390
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,147
You sure? Yeah.

391
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:11,982
Have it your way.

392
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:16,186
You know what, you
know, um, actually...

393
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:18,455
Yeah, I'll... I'll take
you up on that ride.

394
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:20,690
Jump in. Thanks.

395
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,048
<i>Reporter: The nightmare
continues to unfold.</i>

396
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:49,019
<i>The prison warden and the county's top
prosecutor were found terribly mutilated...</i>

397
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:51,555
<i>In separate but possibly
connected incidents.</i>

398
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:55,125
Some speculate the serial killings are
somehow linked... can you turn that off?

399
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:56,760
<i>To the execution
of the original...</i>

400
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:02,732
Hey, by the way, my name's Jack.

401
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,504
How far out west you going?

402
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:09,473
California.

403
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:13,043
You got people out there or you just
trying to get away from that prick?

404
00:35:13,045 --> 00:35:16,813
Listen, I really appreciate
the ride and everything...

405
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:21,885
But I've had a long day and I would
really like to get some rest.

406
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:24,321
Sure, all right.
I'll just drive.

407
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:31,161
I'm sorry, I'm being rude.

408
00:35:31,163 --> 00:35:33,864
No, hey, look, I've
had shit days myself.

409
00:35:33,866 --> 00:35:37,901
So, Jack, how long you
been on the road?

410
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:42,172
Mm, about five minutes
past forever.

411
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,541
Well, that sounds lonely.

412
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:49,446
Not really. And I don't play
well with other people.

413
00:35:49,448 --> 00:35:52,449
But I'd do anything
to be your age.

414
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:54,985
What would you do differently?

415
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:57,187
Absolutely everything.

416
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:02,492
Whoa, watch this.

417
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,161
Oh. I'm sorry.

418
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:08,064
That's okay. Look, I
gotta make one stop.

419
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,533
And there's a hotel there.

420
00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:11,134
No. No hotels.

421
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:14,171
It's not like that. I
gotta get some sleep.

422
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:15,972
And you look like you
could take a break, too.

423
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:19,809
Look, I just, i... I
really need to keep going.

424
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:21,645
Look, I gotta make this stop.

425
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:28,285
So, if you don't like the deal,
just say so and I'll keep driving.

426
00:36:28,287 --> 00:36:29,386
You would do that?

427
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:34,124
Yeah. I can get some
sleep when I die.

428
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:52,869
Whoa, uh, ha-ha, is it cool
if I just stay in the car?

429
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:55,505
Haven't you listened
to the radio?

430
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:58,174
All the bodies they're
finding on this stretch?

431
00:37:58,176 --> 00:38:02,479
You're a lot safer in there with me,
than you are out here without me.

432
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:05,615
What's the worst
that could happen?

433
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,450
Uh-huh.

434
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:29,306
Don't you look
familiar, young lady?

435
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:30,907
The, um...

436
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:33,910
The car's looking pretty
good right about now, Jack.

437
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:37,914
I'm sorry, folks, the honeymoon suite
is already booked for the evening.

438
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:40,917
We're gonna need
two rooms, amigo.

439
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:44,921
Uh, connected if you got 'em.

440
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:47,457
Announcer: Anyone with any
information on the murderer...

441
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:53,029
Police have labeled the reaper,
please call 1-555-587-6238.

442
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:56,232
You heard? About the reaper?

443
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:58,635
How could we not hear?
You got those keys?

444
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:03,206
They say he's on a rampage, seeking
revenge against the unjust.

445
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,675
You actually believe that crap?

446
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:08,712
It doesn't matter, because
I'm not a sinner.

447
00:39:08,714 --> 00:39:12,415
Hey. You're scaring her,
and you're scaring me.

448
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:15,151
Now why don't you
get us those keys?

449
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,988
Boy's a real piece of work.

450
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,724
Oh, I can pay for my own.

451
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:24,227
I got it, I got it. Don't worry.
Rooms eight and nine...

452
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:27,030
And don't forget to pray.

453
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:31,468
Mary, mother of god,
pray for our sinners.

454
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:34,304
Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed by thy name.

455
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,401
That one's yours.

456
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:12,375
Oh, um, hey, thanks
again for everything.

457
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:16,045
You know, I never
did get your name.

458
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:17,947
It's Natalie.

459
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:22,419
All right, Natalie, I'm gonna go down
and move the truck, put it in back.

460
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:24,387
Get some rest.

461
00:41:45,871 --> 00:41:49,038
Hi, mom, I know I said
I'd be there tonight...

462
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,574
But we got a flat tire
and had to pull over...

463
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:53,776
So we're gonna stay the night.

464
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:56,379
Don't worry, though, I'll be there
first thing in the morning.

465
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:59,482
Tell the doctors that I
have the money, okay?

466
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:01,217
I love you.

467
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:38,274
Jack, open up! Jack!

468
00:44:38,276 --> 00:44:40,677
There's someone in my room.

469
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:43,846
Look, it's been a long day.

470
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:47,984
The imagination has a...
Look, he was watching me.

471
00:44:47,986 --> 00:44:49,986
All right, hold on.

472
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:56,092
Come on, hurry!

473
00:44:56,094 --> 00:44:57,860
Why do you have that?

474
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:59,395
Why do you have that?

475
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:04,634
Look, I know that
I saw somebody.

476
00:45:04,636 --> 00:45:05,868
All right.

477
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:12,308
Well, whatever it was,
it's not here now.

478
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:19,716
Oh, my god, you must
be so sick of me.

479
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:23,486
Naw, I'm not bored
with you yet, kid.

480
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:28,024
Why don't we go get a drink
and calm our nerves.

481
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:33,496
So, I thought you were supposed
to be meeting somebody.

482
00:45:33,498 --> 00:45:35,331
Yeah, that's later.

483
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:38,668
Oh, yeah? Thanks for
helping me back there.

484
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:44,140
So, this guy you're running
from, he get outta line?

485
00:45:44,142 --> 00:45:46,375
They all do, eventually.

486
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:50,113
You married?

487
00:45:50,115 --> 00:45:51,380
No.

488
00:45:51,382 --> 00:45:54,383
Ehh. Thought you were too young.
I was, once.

489
00:45:54,385 --> 00:45:59,455
Oh, yeah? Handsome guy like you
got locked down? How'd she do it?

490
00:45:59,457 --> 00:46:03,192
I don't know. Got me
to stop drinking.

491
00:46:03,194 --> 00:46:09,499
I started drinking when I was about 12.
Met her 15 years later and I just quit.

492
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:11,768
Well, how'd she do it?

493
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:15,438
God, I have no idea. It
didn't last anyways.

494
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,274
I still kinda missed the booze.

495
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,009
Started getting out of line.

496
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:22,278
What was her name?

497
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,649
Millie... Mildred.

498
00:46:26,651 --> 00:46:30,486
Well, when did she leave you?

499
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:36,125
It was a car accident. I lived.

500
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:39,362
Kids?

501
00:46:39,364 --> 00:46:40,863
Yeah, I got one.

502
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:44,567
She lives with her aunt in
Florida, her mom's sister.

503
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:46,068
She won't talk to me.

504
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:51,941
So, if you don't have an ex, why
are you going to California?

505
00:46:51,943 --> 00:46:57,079
My mom. She's, um she's not in
the best condition right now.

506
00:46:57,081 --> 00:47:02,285
I'm sorry to hear that.
What about your dad?

507
00:47:02,287 --> 00:47:06,589
Dad? Yeah, he, uh, he wasn't
really good for much...

508
00:47:06,591 --> 00:47:09,692
Except for running
around on my mom and me.

509
00:47:09,694 --> 00:47:14,397
And then one day, he just left.

510
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:19,101
Then my mom had to go
and get sick on me.

511
00:47:19,103 --> 00:47:23,673
You know, not tell me until a
couple of weeks ago how bad it is.

512
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:28,411
Well, looks like both of
us could use a refill.

513
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:38,521
You know, maybe...
Maybe I should go.

514
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:41,157
You got me thinking.

515
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:46,462
Thinking is good...
Only in moderation.

516
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:49,465
I'll walk you out.

517
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:02,545
If you need anything,
come on over.

518
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,814
I'll leave my door unlocked.

519
00:48:04,816 --> 00:48:08,451
You know, you, um, really
shouldn't be so hard on yourself.

520
00:48:08,453 --> 00:48:10,052
You're not that bad of a guy.

521
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:14,023
What do you know? You just met me.
You're just a kid.

522
00:48:14,025 --> 00:48:19,528
Yeah, I'm young, but
I've met enough to know.

523
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:22,098
Get some rest.

524
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,833
You, too.

525
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:56,365
Hello?

526
00:48:58,803 --> 00:49:02,238
Hello?

527
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:09,278
You can't be serious.

528
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,882
What the hell is he watching?

529
00:49:12,884 --> 00:49:14,550
What do you mean you lost it?

530
00:49:14,552 --> 00:49:18,054
I didn't lose it, all right?
It was stolen, man.

531
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:20,656
Okay, stolen, lost, misplaced.
Doesn't matter.

532
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:22,858
No money, no pills.

533
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:25,695
Calm down, all right,
just calm down, old man.

534
00:49:25,697 --> 00:49:27,129
I'm gonna get you your money.

535
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:29,398
Just give me some time to
figure things out, all right?

536
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,802
You got 'til dawn, and
then I'm out of here.

537
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:35,705
Well, mighty kind of you.
Mighty kind of you.

538
00:49:35,707 --> 00:49:41,243
Lemme see, smart guy like you,
only two ways you could be taken.

539
00:49:41,245 --> 00:49:46,315
One would be a woman. The
other would be a woman.

540
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:47,750
Which one was it?

541
00:49:47,752 --> 00:49:52,054
Looked like an angel.

542
00:49:52,056 --> 00:49:56,092
I hope that angel is watching
out for you... tonight.

543
00:49:57,395 --> 00:49:59,528
Toss me a taste, will you?
Just toss me a taste.

544
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,197
What do you think this
is, a charity line?

545
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:05,001
Give me a break, man, I need
to stay wired, come on!

546
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:11,140
All right here,
knock yourself out.

547
00:50:11,142 --> 00:50:13,809
Oh, I hope you brought
more than these.

548
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:17,313
Yeah, sure, here, let me tell
you where my stash is...

549
00:50:17,315 --> 00:50:20,449
So you can come back later
tonight and try to Jack me.

550
00:50:21,786 --> 00:50:24,653
Then I can kill you.

551
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:04,520
Hello? Hello?

552
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:09,325
Hello?

553
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:14,997
Did ya miss me, missy?

554
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:16,332
Jesus!

555
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:18,934
Well, haven't you been a
naughty girl tonight?

556
00:52:18,936 --> 00:52:20,769
And still looking for more.

557
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:23,005
I don't know what
you're talking about.

558
00:52:23,007 --> 00:52:26,208
When you came here, I sensed
you would be my sister.

559
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:29,211
That you would come to know me.

560
00:52:29,213 --> 00:52:33,349
Mm, well, I just came here for a cab.
That's all.

561
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:38,487
Can you... call one?

562
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:52,261
Taxi for one. Last chance...
hotel.

563
00:52:55,773 --> 00:53:02,244
30 minutes or less. If you need anything.
Anything at all...

564
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:07,516
I'm good. Thank you.

565
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:17,893
Yeah, yeah, that's the good news, but the
bad news is he's trying to screw us.

566
00:53:17,895 --> 00:53:20,563
Mm-hm, double.

567
00:53:20,565 --> 00:53:24,033
Double! Hell no, I
didn't pay him that.

568
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:26,835
I mean, I only got half
what he's asking for.

569
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:31,106
<i>Hello?</i>

570
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:49,792
Boys... I was right.

571
00:53:49,794 --> 00:53:52,428
Brad is a punk.

572
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:57,299
Now I want you to go to his
hotel and finish things.

573
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:01,270
One more thing.

574
00:54:01,272 --> 00:54:04,506
When you get the stuff...

575
00:54:04,508 --> 00:54:10,179
Get a big green apple and
put it in his mouth...

576
00:54:10,181 --> 00:54:15,351
Like one of them stuffed pigs.
Now do it.

577
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,727
Jackpot.

578
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:23,652
Sorry, Jack.

579
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:50,846
Damn. Damn.

580
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:03,625
What?

581
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:16,772
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me.

582
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:34,256
Hey, stranger, remember me?

583
00:56:36,127 --> 00:56:38,627
Oh!

584
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:42,898
What the hell's going on?

585
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,199
Natalie?

586
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:46,735
Oh, it's Natalie now, not Sarah?

587
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,203
Both of you shut up!

588
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:49,638
All right, calm down, honey.

589
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:54,343
Oh, your honey over here is
a conniving little thief.

590
00:56:54,345 --> 00:56:55,778
What's he talking about?

591
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,781
Well, go on, Natalie, go on,
or whatever your name is.

592
00:56:58,783 --> 00:57:00,916
Shut up, or I'll put a
bullet in both of you.

593
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:04,820
See, Natalie over here is the woman
that I was telling you about.

594
00:57:04,822 --> 00:57:10,359
And I'm willing to bet she has a whole
lot more than just my money by now.

595
00:57:10,361 --> 00:57:12,795
You so much as breathe,
and I'll shoot.

596
00:57:12,797 --> 00:57:17,866
Ooh, we got a tough girl. You
think we can take her, Jack?

597
00:57:17,868 --> 00:57:19,501
Whoa! Hey!

598
00:57:19,503 --> 00:57:22,504
Yeah-ha. Next time,
I aim higher.

599
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:40,856
You know, I told myself that I was
going to turn over a new leaf.

600
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:45,727
But guys like you make me
feel so good about being bad.

601
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,868
Huh. That's my ride!

602
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:04,913
Aw, no show?

603
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:08,617
What, baby, did you want me
to stick around and play?

604
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:10,319
Natalie, we can work this out.

605
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:11,887
There is nothing to work out.

606
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:14,356
You two are a bunch of
low-life criminals.

607
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:17,159
Unbelievable, the
thief is preaching.

608
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:20,295
Hey, what's in your purse, huh?
What's in it?

609
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,074
That's my ride.

610
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:39,982
You boys have a good night.

611
00:58:39,984 --> 00:58:44,720
You don't know what's
coming for you.

612
00:58:44,722 --> 00:58:46,822
Mmph!

613
00:58:46,824 --> 00:58:50,826
Finally got what you
wanted, huh, baby?

614
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:54,463
You're making a big mistake.

615
00:58:54,465 --> 00:59:00,502
You know what, no, no, because you
already have made a lifetime of them.

616
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,810
I'll get you out, hang
on, I'll get you out.

617
00:59:08,812 --> 00:59:11,446
Rob is sending the bag man. He
don't care who he gotta kill.

618
01:00:14,478 --> 01:00:16,979
What the hell?

619
01:00:16,981 --> 01:00:18,547
That's our guy.

620
01:00:18,549 --> 01:00:22,784
Shoot his ass!

621
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,761
Where'd he go?

622
01:00:32,763 --> 01:00:35,864
You don't know who
you're messing with.

623
01:00:49,713 --> 01:00:53,081
What the hell, man? Joe.

624
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,726
<i>Operator: 9-1-1, what is the
nature of your emergency?</i>

625
01:01:04,728 --> 01:01:10,499
Um, the, the nature of the problem is
an emergency in the last chance hotel.

626
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:13,735
I got a green apple
for you, pig!

627
01:01:20,978 --> 01:01:22,744
Know... the address?

628
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:35,891
The address... is, um...

629
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:48,036
I tried to be righteous, sister.

630
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:52,040
But no, no, you had to
bring out the filth in me.

631
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:54,276
Now you're like gonna like
our sin before you die.

632
01:01:54,278 --> 01:01:57,112
No!

633
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:01,717
Should I tell them about
your friend in room 7?

634
01:02:03,353 --> 01:02:06,655
Or are you ready for your
punishment from your brother?

635
01:02:06,657 --> 01:02:08,123
Hail Mary...

636
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:10,826
Yes! There's a...

637
01:02:10,828 --> 01:02:13,528
Kiss me first, kiss
me first, please!

638
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:16,298
Ow! Ow!

639
01:02:21,805 --> 01:02:25,474
Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha, yeah!
Yeah. Yeah.

640
01:02:25,476 --> 01:02:27,576
You're a harlot,
you're not a killer.

641
01:02:27,578 --> 01:02:28,777
Yeah?

642
01:02:30,114 --> 01:02:31,213
You're a har...

643
01:02:31,215 --> 01:02:34,950
That's divine intervention.
No! No! No!

644
01:02:34,952 --> 01:02:37,853
I never called the taxi.

645
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:44,726
Forbidden fruit, I am going to make
you repent before he comes for you.

646
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:51,867
I made a mistake, reaper!

647
01:02:51,869 --> 01:02:54,803
I was getting her ready for you!

648
01:02:54,805 --> 01:02:57,606
No, reaper, please!

649
01:02:57,608 --> 01:03:00,842
Mercy! Mercy!

650
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:18,126
It's here.

651
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:19,161
Who's here?

652
01:03:19,163 --> 01:03:20,395
Reaper!

653
01:03:20,397 --> 01:03:22,497
Boy, you really have
lost it, haven't you?

654
01:03:22,499 --> 01:03:24,633
There are dead
bodies everywhere!

655
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:27,202
Get the gag out of his mouth.

656
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:33,275
Who's dead?

657
01:03:33,277 --> 01:03:34,609
We are.

658
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:39,614
Be careful!

659
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:56,097
What's in the bag?
What's in the bag?

660
01:04:02,104 --> 01:04:07,175
That's that religious nut's hat.
The desk clerk downstairs.

661
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:11,112
Natalie, what exactly
did you see out there?

662
01:04:11,114 --> 01:04:14,783
I don't know, I mean, first he
was there, and then he wasn't.

663
01:04:14,785 --> 01:04:16,251
Get us out of this damn tape!
No!

664
01:04:16,253 --> 01:04:20,355
Listen! You're gonna need
all the help you can get!

665
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:22,257
Get that machete, cut me loose.

666
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:28,964
I'm trying.

667
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:39,808
Think you could just walk away?
Huh?

668
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:45,647
Where is my money? Where is it?
Huh?

669
01:04:45,649 --> 01:04:47,849
Let her go.

670
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:51,319
She left us for dead, man.

671
01:04:51,321 --> 01:04:54,022
Get off her or I'll
cut your head off.

672
01:04:55,459 --> 01:05:00,929
Drop your weapon! Drop it!

673
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:04,699
Ah, stay back! Stay back,
pretty boy, stay back!

674
01:05:04,701 --> 01:05:06,534
Blondie, you all right?

675
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:09,704
Huh, um, yeah.

676
01:05:09,706 --> 01:05:12,941
All right. Now let's figure
out what's going on.

677
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:19,014
<i>Wake up, boy.</i>

678
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:28,056
Now how does a sweet, innocent
little thing like you...

679
01:05:28,058 --> 01:05:31,259
Find yourself in a heap
of crap like this?

680
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,862
Don't be fooled, officer,
she's as rotten as they come.

681
01:05:33,864 --> 01:05:37,299
I don't remember asking
you a damn thing!

682
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:47,342
What you staring at?

683
01:05:47,344 --> 01:05:48,710
Officer of the law.

684
01:05:48,712 --> 01:05:50,812
That's right.

685
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:55,483
Let's see what you got here.

686
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:04,359
Well, well, well... narcotics.

687
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:08,463
You boys are screwed!

688
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:18,173
Let me tell you
something, darling.

689
01:06:18,175 --> 01:06:21,009
You are one fine piece of pie.

690
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:24,045
Officer?

691
01:06:24,047 --> 01:06:28,016
I don't think that you understand that
there's a psycho killer on the loose.

692
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:36,057
Well, then let's get
our asses out of here.

693
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:40,628
All right, let's go, boys.

694
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:01,616
Careful, officer, she bites.

695
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:04,285
One more word and you'll be
spitting out those shiny teeth.

696
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,092
We need to leave.

697
01:07:11,094 --> 01:07:13,228
Ain't nothing, get you back.

698
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:14,829
Move!

699
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:17,065
Move!

700
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:23,438
Now you three stay in here.
I'm gonna go check that out.

701
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:55,670
There's gotta be a
way out of here.

702
01:07:55,672 --> 01:07:58,239
That's it right there.

703
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:27,168
Well, Daisy may, I suppose if
you want a job done properly...

704
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:29,871
You have to do it yourself.

705
01:08:57,833 --> 01:09:00,602
What the hell?

706
01:09:08,945 --> 01:09:12,780
Run! Run, boy, you can't hide!

707
01:09:12,782 --> 01:09:16,751
The big bad sheriff's up for
a killing party tonight!

708
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:56,925
Natalie, get us out
of these cuffs.

709
01:09:56,927 --> 01:09:58,126
You need us and you know it.

710
01:09:58,128 --> 01:10:00,495
No, the last time, you
almost killed me.

711
01:10:00,497 --> 01:10:02,263
Look around you.

712
01:10:02,265 --> 01:10:06,467
If we stay here tonight,
it's over for all of us.

713
01:10:06,469 --> 01:10:11,439
He's right, Natalie.
Tonight is not our night.

714
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:54,549
That's right, I knew
you had it in you.

715
01:10:54,551 --> 01:10:57,051
Oh, shut up, would you? Come on!

716
01:10:57,053 --> 01:10:58,653
Damn!

717
01:10:58,655 --> 01:10:59,887
It was right there.

718
01:10:59,889 --> 01:11:01,022
I don't see it.

719
01:11:01,024 --> 01:11:02,323
It was right there beneath you.

720
01:11:02,325 --> 01:11:04,192
I can't see it. I
can't see anything!

721
01:11:08,664 --> 01:11:10,164
Hey! It's time to
get out of here.

722
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:22,844
What was that?

723
01:11:24,381 --> 01:11:26,814
My god, where is it? They
were right there, come on!

724
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:31,219
What is... what...

725
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:35,223
Ugh.

726
01:11:35,225 --> 01:11:39,227
Looks like officer what's his
face isn't coming back to get us.

727
01:11:39,229 --> 01:11:41,129
Come on. Come on.

728
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:43,197
I found it. I found it!

729
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:45,199
Get these. Hurry up. Come on!

730
01:11:45,201 --> 01:11:46,801
He's coming.

731
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:51,005
Okay... All right.

732
01:11:52,142 --> 01:11:54,242
Watch out, watch out.

733
01:11:54,244 --> 01:11:56,311
Oh, man,

734
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:11,759
You think that lock is
gonna do us any good?

735
01:12:11,761 --> 01:12:14,529
That thing outside is real.
It's the thing from the news.

736
01:12:14,531 --> 01:12:16,564
And we're next, unless...

737
01:12:16,566 --> 01:12:20,435
Unless what? Huh? So suddenly we're
all best friends all of a sudden?

738
01:12:20,437 --> 01:12:23,571
No offense, but you're not
exactly lifeline material.

739
01:12:23,573 --> 01:12:26,674
And let's just say this is the
last time you and I do business.

740
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:29,477
Okay? So, good luck
to the two of you...

741
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:32,814
I'm getting the
hell out of here.

742
01:12:32,816 --> 01:12:35,483
Walk out that door and
you're a dead man.

743
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:38,653
Only way out of
here is together.

744
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:42,690
Listen, guys, if we... if we can
just make it through the night...

745
01:12:42,692 --> 01:12:46,861
Then your money and your pills will
both be back in your guys' hands.

746
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:51,065
So we're gonna risk getting killed
in exchange for what's already ours?

747
01:12:51,067 --> 01:12:53,534
Or we can die right now.

748
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:57,305
We just gotta make
it to that truck.

749
01:12:57,307 --> 01:12:58,806
Just give me the keys,
I'll go get her.

750
01:12:58,808 --> 01:13:01,509
No. You stay with her.

751
01:13:01,511 --> 01:13:04,645
Get what you owe me.
I'll get the truck.

752
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:13,488
Guys, um... about the truck?
It's kind of, uh, broken.

753
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:14,922
Oh.

754
01:13:14,924 --> 01:13:16,724
I didn't want you
guys following me!

755
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:18,826
But this was before...
Any of this.

756
01:13:18,828 --> 01:13:22,797
Oh, bitch just keeps
getting better and better.

757
01:13:22,799 --> 01:13:25,366
Is there anything
that you can't ruin?

758
01:13:25,368 --> 01:13:30,171
Listen, Jack, if you just put the
wires back in the distributor cap...

759
01:13:30,173 --> 01:13:34,008
She'll run like a charm.

760
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:39,881
You two, hold up your end.
I'll pick you up out front.

761
01:13:39,883 --> 01:13:44,419
Wait, wait, um... About
what I said earlier?

762
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:46,621
I'm really sorry.

763
01:13:46,623 --> 01:13:48,756
It's me who's messing
everything up.

764
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:52,393
Nah, you're gonna be all right.

765
01:13:52,395 --> 01:13:55,663
Just got to be a little smarter.

766
01:13:57,933 --> 01:14:00,368
Stay safe.

767
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:40,775
Aww, getting all lovey dovey.

768
01:14:40,777 --> 01:14:44,679
Now they taught you well at
whore school, didn't they?

769
01:14:44,681 --> 01:14:48,716
You sure as hell can fake it when
you need to make it, can't ya?

770
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:52,086
It's not all fake.

771
01:14:52,088 --> 01:14:55,056
But you wouldn't know the
difference, would you?

772
01:14:55,058 --> 01:14:57,758
You expect me to buy that?

773
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:58,960
Do you?

774
01:15:00,295 --> 01:15:05,066
Look at this face. Would I lie?

775
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:25,520
Holy...

776
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:05,226
Where is it? I don't know.

777
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:06,661
Where'd you put it?

778
01:16:06,663 --> 01:16:08,496
I don't know, listen,
it was right there.

779
01:16:08,498 --> 01:16:09,830
Where is it now?

780
01:16:09,832 --> 01:16:12,667
Look, just stay
here, you look...

781
01:16:12,669 --> 01:16:14,902
I'm gonna go upstairs
and check it out.

782
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:17,305
I don't think so.

783
01:16:17,307 --> 01:16:19,674
Trust me.

784
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,615
Looking for this, Brad?

785
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:05,886
Why do you look so surprised?

786
01:17:05,888 --> 01:17:09,557
All your stuff's there, man.
You're home free.

787
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:14,962
But you never stuck to
your part of the deal.

788
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:17,999
Now, on your knees.

789
01:17:18,001 --> 01:17:19,767
Is that all you got?

790
01:17:19,769 --> 01:17:21,669
Huh, Rob? No, no, no!

791
01:17:21,671 --> 01:17:24,872
I got something a little
bit more poetic for you.

792
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:31,412
Go on. Do it. I want you to.

793
01:17:47,363 --> 01:17:51,332
Looks like Daisy may's
still into you, pal.

794
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:54,201
She's mine now.

795
01:17:54,203 --> 01:17:55,403
Oh!

796
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:19,860
Mm, so are we square?

797
01:18:24,066 --> 01:18:25,900
Almost.

798
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:39,146
Get in! Where's the lunatic?

799
01:18:39,148 --> 01:18:40,781
I don't know, get in!

800
01:18:40,783 --> 01:18:42,850
There's just one problem, Jack.
What?

801
01:18:45,353 --> 01:18:47,822
Why? Why? Get out, now!

802
01:18:47,824 --> 01:18:50,991
You, I should shoot.

803
01:18:50,993 --> 01:18:55,429
But you did save my life back there.
So now we're square.

804
01:18:55,431 --> 01:18:57,765
What? You can't
just leave me here.

805
01:18:57,767 --> 01:18:59,467
Oh, I can, and I will.

806
01:18:59,469 --> 01:19:03,904
See, our little love story is just
way too dangerous, sweetheart.

807
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:06,807
I think you're better
suited for the road.

808
01:19:06,809 --> 01:19:09,176
But we were on to
a new beginning.

809
01:19:09,178 --> 01:19:10,678
New beginning?

810
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:13,380
There are no new beginnings
for people like us.

811
01:19:13,382 --> 01:19:16,250
Haven't you figured
that out already?

812
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:21,388
I'm afraid there's no fairytale
ending for you, sweetheart.

813
01:19:25,228 --> 01:19:26,827
Oh!

814
01:21:14,135 --> 01:21:15,703
Rise.

815
01:21:15,705 --> 01:21:18,839
Behold your fate, sinner.

816
01:21:29,352 --> 01:21:31,185
Why didn't you kill me before?

817
01:21:31,187 --> 01:21:34,188
Salvation was within your reach.

818
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:35,489
What are you doing?

819
01:21:35,491 --> 01:21:38,759
Sending you to hell
where you belong.

820
01:21:38,761 --> 01:21:45,199
You had your chance to change...
but you failed.

821
01:21:45,201 --> 01:21:48,936
Agh!

822
01:21:48,938 --> 01:21:53,841
You're just like the rest of
them, corrupt and wicked.

823
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:14,228
Agh! Agh!

824
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:20,701
Jack! Get the keys
in my front pocket!

825
01:22:26,574 --> 01:22:29,009
It's in the front pocket.

826
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:31,078
Unlock the cuffs.

827
01:22:37,852 --> 01:22:39,153
Thank you.

828
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:48,996
Oh, my god... It's
going to be okay!

829
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:55,669
It already is. You're
gonna walk away.

830
01:22:55,671 --> 01:22:58,439
I'm so sorry!

831
01:22:58,441 --> 01:23:02,743
Don't be. You got time.

832
01:23:02,745 --> 01:23:05,713
What? Take... take the truck.

833
01:23:07,248 --> 01:23:10,084
To start again.

834
01:23:42,585 --> 01:23:45,019
<i>Natalie: Hey mom, I'm
sorry I keep missing you.</i>

835
01:23:45,021 --> 01:23:48,222
<i>On the way back to you now.
The car's all fixed.</i>

836
01:23:48,224 --> 01:23:53,027
<i>I met this really nice man,
Jack, on the road last night.</i>

837
01:23:53,029 --> 01:23:56,764
<i>I guess not all strangers
are the bad kind.</i>

838
01:23:56,766 --> 01:24:01,335
<i>Okay, well, I love you
and I'll see you soon.</i>

839
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:42,576
Where are you headed?

840
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:44,244
Anywhere but here.

841
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:45,913
Hop in.

842
01:24:45,915 --> 01:24:48,682
Are you okay? What
happened to you?

843
01:24:48,684 --> 01:24:52,119
You should see the other guys.

844
01:24:52,987 --> 01:24:55,522
Thanks. I really appreciate it.

845
01:24:55,524 --> 01:24:59,760
Ooh, I can't even begin to tell you about
how many weirdoes I've met on the road.

846
01:24:59,762 --> 01:25:02,362
Huh, I can imagine.

847
01:25:02,364 --> 01:25:05,165
I didn't know a chick could
drive a bad boy like this.

848
01:25:05,167 --> 01:25:07,301
It used to belong to
a friend of mine.

849
01:25:07,303 --> 01:25:09,736
An ex?

850
01:25:09,738 --> 01:25:12,973
Yeah. Something like that.

851
01:25:12,975 --> 01:25:16,844
So... what's your story?

852
01:25:16,846 --> 01:25:20,347

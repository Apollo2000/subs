00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:20,659
<i>If you can, incontramoci Friday' 
ice-cream 'Via Flaminia'.</i>

156
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:23,453
<i>It is a public place, so you can 
feel comfortable with.</i>

157
00:15:23,553 --> 00:15:26,747
<i>I'm not a psychopath. Saro' li', 
at 5 in the afternoon.</i>

158
00:15:26,847 --> 00:15:29,397
<i>I'm sorry if I bothered you...</i>

159
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:32,518
<i>What's up, fucker?</i>

160
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,227
Hey, Fernandito.

161
00:15:41,634 --> 00:15:43,134
- Mario.
- How is it going?

162
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:44,655
<b>,- Well?</b>
- Good.

163
00:15:44,755 --> 00:15:47,005
It is from a lot that people do not 
see.

164
00:15:47,216 --> 00:15:48,966
- Are you okay?
- Yes, Yes.

165
00:15:52,232 --> 00:15:54,032
- Aunt?
- Aunt, well.

166
00:15:54,228 --> 00:15:54,978
Well.

167
00:15:55,674 --> 00:15:58,024
See, Fernandito, I work alone.

168
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,922
I don't know why the Doc he spoke to 
me.

169
00:16:02,022 --> 00:16:03,722
Why are you the number one.

170
00:16:04,508 --> 00:16:06,358
You have the brain... balls...

171
00:16:07,502 --> 00:16:08,402
and money.

172
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:13,077
Do you have children?

173
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:22,064
Mario, not to offend you if I say 
this,

174
00:16:22,164 --> 00:16:24,964
but, do you know why you went in so 
often?

175
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:25,714
No.

176
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,882
- Come on, tell me.
- Why rubacchi small.

177
00:16:28,982 --> 00:16:31,174
I don't rubacchio. I'm not a petty 
thief.

178
00:16:31,274 --> 00:16:33,917
- I'm a professional thief.
- You are right.

179
00:16:34,017 --> 00:16:35,667
Each thing with its name.

180
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,549
I propose to you a thing.

181
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,670
Only one theft...

182
00:16:45,124 --> 00:16:46,124
colossal.

183
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,716
Can I show you something?

184
00:16:52,876 --> 00:16:56,487
But, in the cashier for the 
customers, there is no money.

185
00:16:56,587 --> 00:17:00,387
The central bank has established 
that, if you reach the 10,000 
-<b>pesos,

186
00:17:00,635 --> 00:17:04,185
the cashier must deposit in the safe 
underground.

187
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:06,021
- Do you want to?
- No, No.

188
00:17:06,774 --> 00:17:09,292
The substantial part is located in 
the <i>the vault

189
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,615
where the bank holds the money it 
takes to open that day.

190
00:17:12,715 --> 00:17:16,566
Who ever thought that the banks were 
in the <i>vault the most lucrative!

191
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:20,030
Well, where do you want to arrive 
before giving me a small idea

192
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,980
what do you want from me?

193
00:17:22,516 --> 00:17:23,716
Now you'll see.

194
00:17:28,651 --> 00:17:29,951
For just a moment.

195
00:17:56,504 --> 00:17:57,754
What do you do?

196
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,020
Measure 41, no?

197
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:32,503
We are 18 metres from the be a 
millionaire.

198
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,560
Here above, there is the Tour of Rio.

199
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:45,098
The tide comes up to here?

200
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:48,775
Yes, in two moments of the day the 
tide is low.

201
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:52,421
Let's start to work in one and we go 
in the other.

202
00:18:52,521 --> 00:18:56,771
But if there is a sudden rain, and 
here there is no signal, what to do?

203
00:18:57,047 --> 00:18:59,599
We must follow the current weather 
forecast

204
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:02,099
and enter only when there is good 
weather.

205
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:09,448
Nothing bad...

206
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:11,909
it's not bad.

207
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:25,821
Hello, Lu.

208
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:28,984
I knew that I success.

209
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:33,292
Outside of me: I am here happy to 
dine with you,

210
00:19:33,392 --> 00:19:35,724
you know how dutiful punctuality, 
well,

211
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:38,810
didn't fall in a pit full sidewalk?

212
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,560
Tell me, but you can believe such a 
thing?

213
00:19:42,496 --> 00:19:45,029
- Terrible.
- Is', the devil, zac!, and I 
swallows!

214
00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:46,479
But look a little.

215
00:19:46,945 --> 00:19:48,927
- I-made-flesh, with the pure'.
- Is', good.

216
00:19:49,027 --> 00:19:51,533
- You', to no avail.
- No...

217
00:19:52,115 --> 00:19:54,485
I'm going to bed because work 
tomorrow, I get up early.

218
00:19:54,585 --> 00:19:57,070
As for you, take a glass, feeling 
refreshed, and the...

219
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,781
No, Lu, don't be angry, so,

220
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:01,284
you say that you are fallen in a pit, 
in full avenida Santa Fe',

221
00:20:01,384 --> 00:20:03,009
- I have to do...
- Santa Fe', and what?

222
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:04,955
- Here....<b> - Tell me, Santa Fe', 
and what?

223
00:20:05,055 --> 00:20:07,902
Well, the... the one with... Aona. 
Yes, Aona.

224
00:20:08,002 --> 00:20:09,343
- Santa Fe', and Aona.
- You'.

225
00:20:09,443 --> 00:20:10,743
- Gaona.
- You'.

226
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:13,684
See that we can' trust you?

227
00:20:13,784 --> 00:20:17,134
No, No, you can always trust me, 
please, I beg you.

228
00:20:18,922 --> 00:20:20,426
Have you made a rod?

229
00:20:20,526 --> 00:20:22,551
But to sell drugs, now? That happens 
to you?

230
00:20:22,651 --> 00:20:25,651
Are you mad? I never doped, but what 
do you say?

231
00:20:26,313 --> 00:20:27,888
You stink of marijuana!

232
00:20:29,773 --> 00:20:31,980
Ah, I understand. Yes, I'll explain.

233
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,733
No, believe here. Just.

234
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:34,983
How would it be?

235
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:36,583
Lu?

236
00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:40,242
- Luciana?
- Close the door when you go away.

237
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:47,059
Well, let's make a hole and enter in 
any local bank.

238
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:51,209
All of those rooms do not have motion 
detectors.

239
00:20:51,923 --> 00:20:54,673
- That is, the first thing...
- The temperature.

240
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:58,421
I installed the same system, here, 
last week.

241
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:00,671
And I know already how it works.

242
00:21:00,771 --> 00:21:04,432
The motion detector does not detect 
the movements,

243
00:21:05,638 --> 00:21:06,588
but...

244
00:21:06,955 --> 00:21:09,677
the difference of temperature.

245
00:21:11,702 --> 00:21:12,852
A moment...

246
00:21:14,927 --> 00:21:16,677
The way I see it difficult...

247
00:21:17,016 --> 00:21:19,487
Where is this puppet? Comes to mass 
with you?

248
00:21:19,587 --> 00:21:22,237
Being' calm, Mario, give them a 
chance.

249
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:25,467
If what they show does not go, there 
we go and that's it.

250
00:21:26,292 --> 00:21:28,092
Not for nothing is stupid.

251
00:21:30,203 --> 00:21:31,053
Do you see?

252
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,657
Using these suits made sleeping bags 
for high altitude

253
00:21:37,757 --> 00:21:39,589
the sensor does not detect...

254
00:21:40,194 --> 00:21:43,312
the temperature of the body, and not 
the alarm is triggered.

255
00:21:43,412 --> 00:21:46,900
And you say that we should enter the 
bank masked so with sleeping bags?

256
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,700
You'.

257
00:21:48,786 --> 00:21:49,486
You'.

258
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,868
With these suits, we will be able 
to... move...

259
00:21:53,365 --> 00:21:56,883
quietly for the bank as a whole 
without the shots the alarm.

260
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,633
- Quietly.
- Quietly, you'.

261
00:21:59,914 --> 00:22:02,134
And how do you plan to open the 
<i>the vaults of the bank?

262
00:22:02,234 --> 00:22:04,184
For this thing, give me time.

263
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,733
Now, we need a plan of the bank.

264
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:11,372
<i>Parking</i>

265
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:25,663
- Please, come with me, lord.

266
00:23:25,763 --> 00:23:28,613
- Okay, let's go. For what?
- I, to accompany.

267
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:34,454
Honestly, I don't understand why.

268
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:35,815
Why?

269
00:23:39,803 --> 00:23:41,103
What do you suspect?

270
00:23:53,044 --> 00:23:56,247
<i>Vault safety deposit Boxes</i>

271
00:23:56,775 --> 00:23:59,175
You are wrong, I was not doing photos.

272
00:23:59,804 --> 00:24:01,554
I was looking at <i>menu.

273
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,379
I did not do photos.

274
00:24:04,158 --> 00:24:07,390
For pleasure, I am an artist. All of 
this is ridiculous.

275
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,790
Well. The apologies, lord.

276
00:24:11,127 --> 00:24:13,727
And who repays me in this bad time?

277
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,672
- Huh? Who pays?
- No one, lord.

278
00:24:16,772 --> 00:24:18,898
- It is our job, no?
- Had'...

279
00:24:18,998 --> 00:24:21,995
Should I just speak with the 
secretariat of the human rights.

280
00:24:22,095 --> 00:24:24,545
- And, by...
- please, not there to create 
problems...

281
00:24:24,645 --> 00:24:25,745
Ground floor.

282
00:24:27,028 --> 00:24:29,278
Here, there is a ditch with the meter.

283
00:24:29,653 --> 00:24:30,753
Underground.

284
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:34,183
The <i>the vaults of the bank, and 
here, more or less, at this height.

285
00:24:34,283 --> 00:24:36,872
And here, safety deposit boxes. 
Hundreds of them.

286
00:24:36,972 --> 00:24:39,072
But our port of entry to...

287
00:24:40,183 --> 00:24:41,333
it will be this.

288
00:24:41,515 --> 00:24:43,952
It is located in a small room where I 
have retained:

289
00:24:44,052 --> 00:24:46,252
it's the perfect place to enter.

290
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,352
Then...

291
00:24:49,325 --> 00:24:51,925
depths in the drainage channel, 18 
feet.

292
00:24:52,202 --> 00:24:53,702
Now, we need to know

293
00:24:53,921 --> 00:24:56,671
what distance there is between the 
gutter and the bank.

294
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,629
You can not stretch a meter in the 
street. There is the guardiola of 
surveillance

295
00:25:00,729 --> 00:25:03,379
- and the guard of the bank.
- You are right.

296
00:25:03,803 --> 00:25:05,535
Think of something else.

297
00:25:38,323 --> 00:25:42,866
7 meters and 10 centimeters from the 
manhole to the bank.

298
00:25:44,372 --> 00:25:47,191
18 meters of depth in the drainage 
channel.

299
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:50,541
We have the two sides of a triangle 
and so we can...

300
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:53,152
to find the hypotenuse.

301
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:55,881
- The hypotenuse, what?
- By, by, by, va!

302
00:25:55,981 --> 00:25:56,831
Exact.

303
00:25:57,325 --> 00:26:00,989
The tunnel: from here to here, so. 
See?

304
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,120
And in this corner, angle of 
inclination,

305
00:26:04,684 --> 00:26:07,384
you calculate the arc tangent.

306
00:26:08,016 --> 00:26:11,048
Arc tangent: the 2nd year of Geometry.

307
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:14,118
And this moron, also he arrived late 
to the lesson of Geometry?

308
00:26:14,218 --> 00:26:16,568
He was always the best of the class.

309
00:26:19,053 --> 00:26:20,953
Always with that shit, eh!

310
00:26:21,829 --> 00:26:23,179
Shit, no, Mario.

311
00:26:23,607 --> 00:26:26,257
This is a sensory experience... is it 
so?

312
00:26:28,204 --> 00:26:31,531
Everything that you think, or that 
you can produce under cannabis

313
00:26:32,115 --> 00:26:34,215
it is the opposite of tension.

314
00:26:34,531 --> 00:26:37,431
- Under cannabis.
- Quite the opposite. See...

315
00:26:37,713 --> 00:26:40,130
this... to me, this reinforces the 
observation.

316
00:26:41,115 --> 00:26:44,265
I smoke... and they are super 
concentrated.

317
00:26:45,246 --> 00:26:48,496
So I insert it in a design like this.

318
00:26:48,985 --> 00:26:50,592
If I had not smoked marijuana

319
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,542
this robbery would not have the 
balance that he has.

320
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:55,642
Doesn't make you talk, huh?

321
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,269
You don't realize but you talk, talk, 
talk.

322
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:01,556
When you commit an immoral action, 
like robbing a bank,

323
00:27:01,656 --> 00:27:04,899
most think of the side effects that 
produce

324
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:07,638
with greater empathy and personal 
ethics,

325
00:27:07,738 --> 00:27:10,938
much better will be the social 
reaction as a result.

326
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:12,554
The what and' so'.

327
00:27:12,654 --> 00:27:15,757
Here, no one will' the hunger until 
the reimbursement of the insurance.

328
00:27:15,857 --> 00:27:18,896
On the contrary, there will be 
someone to pronounce him' more' than 
what he had

329
00:27:18,996 --> 00:27:20,246
set aside.

330
00:27:20,642 --> 00:27:22,392
Here, there is no real harm.

331
00:27:22,571 --> 00:27:25,921
The bank loses, yes, but people will 
be happy.

332
00:27:26,246 --> 00:27:28,147
- Balance...
- Natural.

333
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:34,610
In short, hearing you, it almost 
makes you want to be ripped off, 
really.

334
00:27:35,744 --> 00:27:38,438
Why not leave a note to the owners of 
the boxes

335
00:27:38,538 --> 00:27:41,338
explaining all of this. They will be 
delighted.

336
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,501
Now, I would like to know how you are 
going to open <i>vault.

337
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:49,460
You continue with the natural 
balance, and I continue to spend 
vacuum?

338
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,060
Tell me, so much in order to get an 
idea.

339
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:55,711
Sorry, guys, I had to bring Lolito at 
a party.

340
00:27:55,811 --> 00:27:57,336
Not wanted to stay. That tantrum!

341
00:27:57,436 --> 00:28:00,540
From, because I do not think with 
this natural balance.

342
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,364
Speak, speak, speak, speak!

343
00:28:28,255 --> 00:28:29,905
Here, we've arrived.

344
00:28:33,516 --> 00:28:36,183
- We need to be more.
- On the job, guys!

345
00:28:38,451 --> 00:28:39,851
- See that?
- You'.

346
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:48,669
- Sostienilo.
- You'.

347
00:29:04,692 --> 00:29:05,442
Ow!

348
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:07,092
- You put it down?
- You'.

349
00:29:14,897 --> 00:29:16,997
- Attentive to the cut, eh!
- You'.

350
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:44,013
How will you open the mailbox?

351
00:29:44,113 --> 00:29:46,938
- With a stick, as it once was.
- You are a romantic.

352
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:47,888
I don't know.

353
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:51,580
I don't know, after having forced the 
twentieth or thirtieth cassette,

354
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,316
they form lactic acid, the muscles 
weaken,

355
00:29:54,416 --> 00:29:58,071
there is more chance of an accident. 
No, we have to find another way.

356
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,276
Such as accidents? We have 12 hours 
to open some box.

357
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:04,176
If it were a weekend would be more 
than 48 hours.

358
00:30:04,276 --> 00:30:06,772
And a torch? It takes just a minute 
to open one.

359
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:09,590
We calculate more than 400 safety 
deposit boxes,

360
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:12,831
with a torch it would be 1 minute, or 
1 and a half, on average, per box.

361
00:30:12,931 --> 00:30:15,808
We would stay 7 hours in the bank. It 
is too much.

362
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,250
Must be faster. We must study the 
lock.

363
00:30:19,512 --> 00:30:22,166
And as we study it if none of us know 
the <i>vault.

364
00:30:22,266 --> 00:30:23,966
We have to rent a deposit box.

365
00:30:25,305 --> 00:30:27,094
By doing so, would our data.

366
00:30:27,194 --> 00:30:29,994
Not in this branch, Mario, in another.

367
00:30:31,314 --> 00:30:32,675
- Do you want to?
- No, step.

368
00:30:32,775 --> 00:30:35,025
Take that stuff, makes me die!

369
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,604
Mr. Vitette.

370
00:31:00,704 --> 00:31:02,334
- Many thanks.
- Please.

371
00:31:02,434 --> 00:31:04,829
- Number of 8-20.
- Yes, sir.

372
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:13,849
Perfect.

373
00:31:25,575 --> 00:31:26,475
In place?

374
00:31:27,322 --> 00:31:29,172
Yes, yes, okay, for today.

375
00:31:31,855 --> 00:31:33,705
Now, of course only...

376
00:31:34,055 --> 00:31:37,341
adjust the tunnel to 69 degrees.

377
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:39,509
We need a theodolite.

378
00:31:39,784 --> 00:31:41,517
- A what?
- A theodolite.

379
00:31:41,617 --> 00:31:46,017
The angle of the excavation must be 
precise, or we go out to the library 
here.

380
00:31:46,143 --> 00:31:47,793
We need to buy one.

381
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:50,756
<u> - $3,000.</u>
- Good. And if the rubassimo?

382
00:31:50,856 --> 00:31:52,361
- You can't.
- Why?

383
00:31:52,461 --> 00:31:53,968
You already know, Mario. The natural 
balance.

384
00:31:54,068 --> 00:31:56,738
- You will continue with this 
foolishness?
- It is not for nothing.

385
00:31:56,838 --> 00:31:59,352
How much more do I have to spend? You 
kidding me?

386
00:31:59,452 --> 00:32:02,081
- And the rest is in place, Fernando?
- I said we work.

387
00:32:02,181 --> 00:32:05,231
- The sistemero'...
- you Can listen to me for a moment?

388
00:32:05,782 --> 00:32:08,332
A tripod, a conveyor in the corners,

389
00:32:08,664 --> 00:32:10,214
and a laser pointer.

390
00:32:10,924 --> 00:32:11,924
Theodolite.

391
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:15,571
Are we going to? I told my wife that 
I went fishing.

392
00:32:19,887 --> 00:32:20,787
Ok, go'.

393
00:32:21,569 --> 00:32:22,951
But at 100, there's the door.

394
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:25,901
Where, shit, sara, what? Leave it in 
gear.

395
00:32:26,219 --> 00:32:27,901
We consume gas for nothing.

396
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:31,796
Listen, dear, you're new, I know that 
they say very good of you, but I do 
not know you.

397
00:32:31,896 --> 00:32:35,953
I'll explain the context of the 
situation, so you understand better 
the panorama.

398
00:32:36,842 --> 00:32:40,742
We are on the van stolen, and you 
have stolen a very strange

399
00:32:40,842 --> 00:32:43,596
and expect a jerk that should be 
there and not there',

400
00:32:43,696 --> 00:32:45,610
and then, in this neighborhood of 
shit...

401
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,757
Then, leave it in gear, why there 
should be any surprise...

402
00:32:48,857 --> 00:32:51,307
- we can move fast, yes?
- Ok.

403
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:52,855
Do what it tells you.

404
00:32:53,184 --> 00:32:56,084
Now, we are all screwed. We wanted to 
own.

405
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,770
That break, but for pleasure!

406
00:33:04,527 --> 00:33:05,927
- Salve.
- Salve.

407
00:33:07,162 --> 00:33:08,362
That do you guys?

408
00:33:08,462 --> 00:33:10,494
Expect a friend, but it seems that it 
has given us hole.

409
00:33:10,594 --> 00:33:13,023
- Pass me the documents? <u> Yeah, of 
course.

410
00:33:13,854 --> 00:33:16,744
That's the problem, and', persons? We 
are in a democracy!

411
00:33:16,844 --> 00:33:18,644
There is no doubt, gentlemen.

412
00:33:19,962 --> 00:33:21,012
Booklet...

413
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,509
insurance...

414
00:33:27,575 --> 00:33:29,835
Who is Walter Well?

415
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,644
- My uncle, agent.
- His uncle.

416
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:37,078
Hi, is there any problem?

417
00:33:37,178 --> 00:33:38,586
- Hi, guys.
- Salve.

418
00:33:38,686 --> 00:33:40,786
- Are our friends.
- Ah, yes.

419
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:43,767
Chela, it was you?

420
00:33:43,867 --> 00:33:45,942
Yes, Momi, I called him.

421
00:33:46,042 --> 00:33:47,929
And that I are worried.

422
00:33:48,684 --> 00:33:50,987
You know, I saw that van,

423
00:33:51,227 --> 00:33:54,630
those faces... those people.

424
00:33:54,861 --> 00:33:58,113
Excuse me, agent, I'm sorry, boys, 
I'm sorry.

425
00:33:58,659 --> 00:34:00,709
- Claw...
- okay, okay.

426
00:34:00,903 --> 00:34:03,703
Very well, lady. Very good attitude.

427
00:34:04,118 --> 00:34:06,959
Go on watch in the neighborhood. 
Congratulations.

428
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:09,241
- All right, then?
- We're good.

429
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:11,241
- Thanks, agent.
- Well...

430
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:14,953
And...

431
00:34:16,364 --> 00:34:17,799
as you like it, cousin?

432
00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:21,078
- The clutch pulls a lot? <u> It 
seems to me a bit short.

433
00:34:21,778 --> 00:34:23,092
You cannot spread?

434
00:34:23,192 --> 00:34:25,392
Well, the leg is not allunghera'.

435
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:27,013
It's heavy duty.

436
00:34:27,748 --> 00:34:29,098
How do you feel?

437
00:34:29,844 --> 00:34:32,362
What do I know, well. I feel that 
effort.

438
00:34:33,331 --> 00:34:36,553
I get the carburetor because it has a 
bit more of a recovery.

439
00:34:36,653 --> 00:34:37,403
Well.

440
00:34:41,549 --> 00:34:42,599
Let's get started.

441
00:34:43,703 --> 00:34:44,620
If you can'.

442
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,276
Well, I think of you'. Yes, yes.

443
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:49,076
Do you think you talk, or do we have 
to ask us?

444
00:34:49,376 --> 00:34:51,665
Talk about what? What the fuck are 
you doing here, your wife?

445
00:34:51,765 --> 00:34:55,030
- Where should I put it, if he lives 
here?
- We would have had to be alone.

446
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,383
- Had not said anything.
- How?

447
00:34:56,483 --> 00:34:58,183
Had not said anything.

448
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:01,163
The 'Turkish' does not speak'.

449
00:35:01,263 --> 00:35:05,013
There is also inside you. I have 
never cheated, it must do so now?

450
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:19,350
No, what I am saying is that you have 
a vice, which is to fuck.

451
00:35:19,529 --> 00:35:21,879
- And that's not good?
- It's not good.

452
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:27,639
And there come the women with the 
faith?

453
00:35:27,955 --> 00:35:30,605
But fuck it is an act of faith, or 
not?

454
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,070
Careful! Careful!

455
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:50,331
Cacho?

456
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:52,599
Daniel?

457
00:35:53,924 --> 00:35:55,424
Tito is out of the game.

458
00:35:56,628 --> 00:35:58,203
Yes, yes... eh...

459
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:02,120
you are detached pieces but does not 
fall more land.

460
00:36:02,766 --> 00:36:06,816
- And the tunnel remained off the 
same.
- So it was only that part.

461
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,913
- Driller and was destroyed.
- No, stop.

462
00:36:10,013 --> 00:36:13,402
- And tomorrow, I buy another.
- No, just, I end up here. Just.

463
00:36:13,502 --> 00:36:16,381
Mario, we made the most of the middle 
of the tunnel, we are 7 metres from 
the bank.

464
00:36:16,481 --> 00:36:19,031
Just tell me if you know how to open 
<i>vault.

465
00:36:19,371 --> 00:36:21,492
I didn't believe this cost me so much 
but I gues you are not soon.

466
00:36:21,592 --> 00:36:24,374
- Can't you see that it's all useless.
- There are no impossible solutions.

467
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:27,156
- There are problems ill-posed.
- Just nonsense, I have the balls 
full.

468
00:36:27,256 --> 00:36:28,056
Enough!

469
00:36:29,201 --> 00:36:31,451
And' stuff by professionals, this.

470
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:35,533
We're playing it all: health, time, 
and in my case, money.

471
00:36:35,633 --> 00:36:37,782
Here I gave you the rope, Fernando, 
now just.

472
00:36:37,882 --> 00:36:40,235
Do you want to enjoy an adventure? 
Go, thrown with the parachute,

473
00:36:40,335 --> 00:36:42,434
drunk, do what you want,

474
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:45,684
just tell me if you know how to open 
<i>vault. Answer me.

475
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:09,275
Among all, which are you?

476
00:37:12,503 --> 00:37:13,303
Sirius.

477
00:37:14,903 --> 00:37:16,353
The eye of heaven.

478
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:20,853
I like Sirius. I like the name.

479
00:37:21,389 --> 00:37:24,095
It's crazy, because if you put 
yourself to think...

480
00:37:24,195 --> 00:37:26,695
we are seeing the past of the stars.

481
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:32,066
The light puts us years to get to 
here, then some there are already' 
more'.

482
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,066
And it's true.

483
00:37:34,384 --> 00:37:36,884
We think we are, but there are more.

484
00:37:49,523 --> 00:37:51,073
"We think we are...

485
00:37:52,459 --> 00:37:54,059
"but there are no more"!

486
00:38:24,423 --> 00:38:26,023
<i>- Who is it for?</i>
- Fernando.

487
00:38:26,735 --> 00:38:29,135
<i>- I people.</i>
- Mario, I have to talk to.

488
00:38:29,235 --> 00:38:32,349
<i>Fernando I'll call you tomorrow. 
Don't break the balls.</i>

489
00:38:32,449 --> 00:38:33,431
Appearance.

490
00:38:36,336 --> 00:38:38,336
<i>Come on, come on, but do not 
knock.</i>

491
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:45,592
Mario.

492
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,970
Let me in.

493
00:38:47,567 --> 00:38:48,367
Mario.

494
00:38:59,475 --> 00:39:01,575
- You were busy.
- What do you want?

495
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:03,050
- I have the solution.
- Of what?

496
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,100
Of everything.

497
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,832
- You 'smoked'?
- Nothing to do with it.

498
00:39:10,518 --> 00:39:12,430
- We see a little bit.
- Mario, the banks

499
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:15,224
are well protected when they are 
closed,

500
00:39:15,324 --> 00:39:19,224
and are well-protected when they are 
open, but the measurements are 
different.

501
00:39:20,029 --> 00:39:23,170
There are good security measures to 
avoid the robbery at the tills.

502
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:26,133
And good security measures to avoid 
the "hole".

503
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:29,668
But, so far, no one has ever created 
a system of safety,

504
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:31,911
if they occur...

505
00:39:32,668 --> 00:39:34,868
the two things at the same time.

506
00:39:35,802 --> 00:39:37,666
The "hole" and "robbery express".

507
00:39:39,439 --> 00:39:41,453
Then, we...

508
00:39:42,074 --> 00:39:43,746
we enter in the bank...

509
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,660
when it is open to the public.

510
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,610
- In the <i>caveau will be open...
- No alarm.

511
00:39:51,677 --> 00:39:53,027
For the police...

512
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,984
must be something usual,

513
00:39:56,084 --> 00:40:00,141
a robbery express, of the petty 
thieves who steal the cash of the 
customers.

514
00:40:00,241 --> 00:40:03,639
But the things inside of the bank is 
complicated.

515
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,160
And we, what do we do in that time?

516
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:07,549
We do "cucu'".

517
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,446
Clock cucu'...

518
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:13,782
We see that you do not want to flee 
for the door.

519
00:40:14,524 --> 00:40:17,516
And if the police believes that it 
does not want to flee for the door,

520
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:21,766
because it is a robbery of express, 
certainly not going to think that we 
have the "hole"!

521
00:40:22,469 --> 00:40:25,801
The "hole" that we will not enter in 
the bank, but for...

522
00:40:28,812 --> 00:40:29,662
Get out!

523
00:41:43,817 --> 00:41:44,932
How do you call it?

524
00:41:56,731 --> 00:41:57,781
Voltage...

525
00:41:59,056 --> 00:42:00,206
relaxation.

526
00:42:02,463 --> 00:42:03,513
Voltage...

527
00:42:04,809 --> 00:42:05,959
relaxation.

528
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:10,043
Voltage...

529
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,413
<i>Parking</i>

530
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:07,612
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a 
robbery

531
00:44:08,064 --> 00:44:10,864
I want all flat, belly to the ground! 
Force!

532
00:44:10,964 --> 00:44:12,825
- All!
- All down!

533
00:44:12,925 --> 00:44:15,137
Fermi there, or you'll end up all bad!

534
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:17,913
You to the ground. To the ground! Do 
not look up.

535
00:44:18,013 --> 00:44:20,513
I told you to stand down or I will 
kill you!

536
00:44:23,393 --> 00:44:24,747
Central Acassuso?

537
00:44:24,847 --> 00:44:27,479
Serrano, Banco Rio. There is a bank 
robbery!

538
00:44:28,675 --> 00:44:32,300
Give me the money! Force, to fill it! 
All! Fill it, fill it I said!

539
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,750
You, too, asshole! Force, go!

540
00:44:34,864 --> 00:44:35,664
Force!

541
00:44:36,053 --> 00:44:39,853
Do the jerk, to fill it. Fill the 
entire case. Come on, come on!

542
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:43,303
Come on, put still! Still! Draw them 
out!

543
00:44:43,403 --> 00:44:45,028
- There is more.
- Here, dick!

544
00:44:45,128 --> 00:44:46,585
- There is not!
- Do the jerk!

545
00:44:46,685 --> 00:44:48,428
Continues to fill it for you!

546
00:45:04,115 --> 00:45:05,365
Stage 1: "Cucu'".

547
00:45:05,758 --> 00:45:07,448
Come on, you, come on! Get up.

548
00:45:07,548 --> 00:45:09,458
What can I say to you, and not 
happens nothing.

549
00:45:09,558 --> 00:45:10,640
- Cucu'.
- Ok.

550
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,308
Continue to fill it with!

551
00:45:12,408 --> 00:45:14,862
<u> 'Stop, police!</u>
- No! No, No, don't shoot.

552
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,708
Not even you. Exit from there.

553
00:45:17,447 --> 00:45:18,776
Throw down the gun!

554
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:20,251
Leave him alone!

555
00:45:20,849 --> 00:45:21,999
Come on in.

556
00:45:26,461 --> 00:45:28,475
- No, do not watch.
- What would happen?

557
00:45:28,575 --> 00:45:29,375
So.

558
00:45:31,058 --> 00:45:33,008
- Stage 2: "The Bunker".
- Bunker.

559
00:45:33,426 --> 00:45:34,936
- Come on, you. Come on.
- I?

560
00:45:35,036 --> 00:45:36,636
You, move. Move it!

561
00:45:36,854 --> 00:45:38,604
On, come here. Come on, come on.

562
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,086
Here, come here.

563
00:45:40,329 --> 00:45:41,250
On, and strength.

564
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:44,550
On the scale. Walk slowly that will 
happen is nothing.

565
00:45:44,733 --> 00:45:46,126
On, come on. Shut up.

566
00:45:46,226 --> 00:45:47,976
Let's go, come on, come on out.

567
00:45:48,076 --> 00:45:50,236
The bag, watch it here. And' them'.

568
00:45:50,336 --> 00:45:51,036
From.

569
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:52,215
By!

570
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:55,047
Come on out, that'll kill you, eh!

571
00:45:55,147 --> 00:45:56,897
Martin, please, quit!

572
00:45:57,766 --> 00:45:59,373
Martin open, Martin!

573
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:01,848
Martin, please, open!

574
00:46:01,948 --> 00:46:04,316
- I haven't seen my nephew! <u> Come 
On, Martin!

575
00:46:04,416 --> 00:46:06,702
Not cincischiare much. We have 
nothing to lose.

576
00:46:06,802 --> 00:46:08,306
Out there and the police.

577
00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:11,659
Not to complicate things. Come on. 
Exit, from.

578
00:46:13,267 --> 00:46:15,538
Not to complicate everything, I tell 
you. From.

579
00:46:17,529 --> 00:46:21,129
- Exit, otherwise the kill!
- The kills, I know. The kills.

580
00:46:22,576 --> 00:46:24,504
Stop it, or they will become more 
nervous.

581
00:46:24,604 --> 00:46:27,147
Don't will happen nothing, but you, 
quit. From.

582
00:46:27,247 --> 00:46:27,997
Exit.

583
00:46:29,884 --> 00:46:32,634
Well... you made the precious, 
trippone, eh?

584
00:46:33,473 --> 00:46:34,573
Well, so.

585
00:46:42,479 --> 00:46:44,401
Still, here it all goes to hell!

586
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:45,608
Give up!

587
00:46:45,876 --> 00:46:47,933
Do not do evil to anyone. You are 
surrounded!

588
00:46:48,033 --> 00:46:49,596
- Please, take it you.
- No.

589
00:46:49,696 --> 00:46:51,292
Not nothing. By, by, by.

590
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:53,392
- Give me the phone.
- All hands up!

591
00:46:53,492 --> 00:46:55,681
If I want to talk about, to do with 
this.

592
00:46:55,781 --> 00:46:57,852
Line, otherwise, I repent. Force. 
Move.

593
00:46:57,952 --> 00:46:59,052
Give up!

594
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:04,575
Anyone clever! The bank full of 
hostages.

595
00:47:05,004 --> 00:47:07,954
<i>- You, from that part.</i>
- First, go to the other.

596
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,650
Move here, and I kill you.

597
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,990
Stage 3: "Camcorders".

598
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:48,745
Stage 4: "Break", Pepper.

599
00:47:56,444 --> 00:47:57,544
I?

600
00:48:18,034 --> 00:48:19,738
Stage 5: "Cannon Power".

601
00:49:04,436 --> 00:49:07,386
- How do you call this beast?
- Cannon Power.

602
00:49:07,717 --> 00:49:08,520
Now.

603
00:49:14,627 --> 00:49:15,427
Time.

604
00:49:17,033 --> 00:49:18,033
7 seconds!

605
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:43,736
Stage 6: The "Time".

606
00:50:00,851 --> 00:50:03,669
I saw that he was about to flee with 
a hostage, I gave him the alt,

607
00:50:03,769 --> 00:50:06,135
and could not make a return in the 
bank.

608
00:50:06,235 --> 00:50:08,235
Shortly after, they liberated Serrano.

609
00:50:08,387 --> 00:50:10,116
Yes, they went to 4 or 5.

610
00:50:10,576 --> 00:50:11,376
4 or 5?

611
00:50:11,979 --> 00:50:15,423
I have seen 4, lord. And they have 
guns, a rifle...

612
00:50:15,977 --> 00:50:18,985
Then, put the cap, tried to rob the 
cashier on the first floor...

613
00:50:19,085 --> 00:50:21,167
but they saw that they were 
surrounded,...

614
00:50:21,267 --> 00:50:24,435
- How many hostages are?
- Between employees and customers,

615
00:50:24,535 --> 00:50:27,000
- about thirty people.
- Cameras?

616
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:30,321
They entered the bunker, but there is 
a new security system

617
00:50:30,421 --> 00:50:33,739
it saves the information in a 
hard-disk that is in central.

618
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:36,132
- Well, what else?
- I asked for the phone...

619
00:50:36,232 --> 00:50:38,832
- I requires the gun.
- That regulate.

620
00:50:38,932 --> 00:50:39,632
You'.

621
00:50:39,824 --> 00:50:43,824
Maybe they did it on purpose, just to 
avoid a disciplinary sanction.

622
00:50:44,977 --> 00:50:46,577
And if they were colleagues?

623
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,820
I have no idea, lord.

624
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:12,300
There's the guy?

625
00:51:14,764 --> 00:51:16,114
I'm wetting myself.

626
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:17,800
Will not hear you.

627
00:51:19,179 --> 00:51:20,529
I'm wetting myself.

628

You don't make to wait?

629
00:51:28,803 --> 00:51:30,703

Don't you?

They are going up on the roof. 
Bastards, want to get into the bank.

- A friend of the judge.

647
00:52:34,997 --> 00:52:38,418
As soon as the police will know of 
the robbery in a few minutes we will

we open the safety deposit boxes.

You have gone mad.

651
00:52:46,969 --> 00:52:49,611
I am a thief. I climb on the 
balconies, settle the pain in the ass,

652
00:52:49,711 --> 00:52:52,930
I do the bad, if there is need, but 
this is another thing, no.

Tension, relaxation, tension, 
relaxation.

658

Act and action, or not?

661
00:53:11,477 --> 00:53:14,604
So. Connect with others who have come 
to the lesson,

662
00:53:14,704 --> 00:53:17,226
and begin to understand where we're 
headed. The Force, Mario.

<i>Approached. Come closer, please,

the main gate and the parking.

709
00:56:04,655 --> 00:56:07,662
You do not know where they are now, 
the hostages... where to keep them.

710
00:56:07,762 --> 00:56:09,784
Perhaps distributed on the 3 floors, 
or...

711
00:56:09,884 --> 00:56:12,523
move them from the place. You do not 
know where they are.

712
00:56:12,623 --> 00:56:16,494
- What is planned, the prosecutor?
- For now, and attempted robbery.

<i>- Give me time. Is coming.</i>
- But, is the tricycle?

725
00:56:49,473 --> 00:56:51,979
Trust that I'm doing everything I can,

726
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,264
<i>but you have to help me... a 
hostage.</i>

727
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:58,846
Free a hostage, so they will think 
that you want to have a happy ending.

Tell me, how many burglars have you 
seen?

737
00:57:29,509 --> 00:57:31,159
Weapons, what kind of weapons?

738
00:57:33,243 --> 00:57:36,143
The hostages are all together or are 
they separate?

739

birthday.</i>

778
01:00:25,571 --> 01:00:26,982
Are you kidding, Ramirez?

779
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:31,861
# Happy birthday to you... ##

780
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:34,171
What is it? A funeral? Come on, come 
on!

781
01:00:34,271 --> 01:00:38,556
# Happy birthday to you #

782
01:00:38,915 --> 01:00:44,519
# Happy birthday, Susanita #

783
01:00:45,038 --> 01:00:49,935
# Happy birthday to you! ##

784
01:00:50,454 --> 01:00:52,265
Brava!

785
01:00:53,938 --> 01:00:56,338
And now there's a gift that will, 
Susy.

786
01:00:57,259 --> 01:00:58,809
We go to the house.

787
01:00:59,241 --> 01:01:00,848
Yes, now. Let's go.

788
01:01:01,067 --> 01:01:05,589
5, 6, 7, 8, let's go!

789
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,558
Your bag, treasure.

790
01:01:07,658 --> 01:01:09,603
- Let's go home, Susy.
- You'...

791
01:01:09,703 --> 01:01:11,718
To celebrate the birthday with the 
grandchildren.

792
01:01:11,818 --> 01:01:13,821
- You'.
- I ask you a favor, darling.

793
01:01:13,921 --> 01:01:16,484
This is a gift for the policeman who 
welcomes you.

794
01:01:16,584 --> 01:01:18,449
Tell him: "You sent him, Walter".

795
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:21,563
If you question, "How has treated 
you, Walter?", you say, "Oh, it's 
fantastic!"

796
01:01:21,663 --> 01:01:24,074
Tell him "Eh, we played so well with 
him."

797
01:01:24,174 --> 01:01:26,024
So... hello, sweetheart, hello.

798
01:01:26,288 --> 01:01:29,845
- Lady! Lady, you come near me!
- Hello, I wish you a beautiful 
celebration!

799
01:01:29,945 --> 01:01:31,945
- And that's it.
- Be, lady.

800
01:01:32,568 --> 01:01:33,818
Hello, my life!

801
01:01:37,381 --> 01:01:39,431
Quiet, quiet. Is.

802
01:01:39,538 --> 01:01:42,638
- Well, all right. Careful.
- Let's go, let's go.

803
01:01:42,867 --> 01:01:45,326
Miguel, I rescued a granny.

804
01:01:45,683 --> 01:01:49,091
Thank You, Walter. Have you spoken 
with the guys? As it goes, them'?

805
01:01:49,191 --> 01:01:51,487
Evil. The matter is complicated.

806
01:01:51,587 --> 01:01:52,616
Son of a bitch.

807
01:01:52,716 --> 01:01:54,980
Things may end better than you think.

808
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,848
<i>We came to do one thing fast,</i>

809
01:01:56,948 --> 01:02:00,363
but we have put so much, that 
everything went to hell. A sin.

810
01:02:00,463 --> 01:02:04,163
- Personally, here's what you need to 
do.
- Make it easy on you, Miguel.

811
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:06,759
Listen, I'll tell you'...

812
01:02:08,161 --> 01:02:12,800
I went out two weeks ago, after 15 
years of imprisonment, Miguel.

813
01:02:13,357 --> 01:02:16,219
- You arrive at understand what I 
say? <i>- Yes, I understand that, yes.

814
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:20,270
The more time passes, the more you 
complicate things, you know? You have 
to establish.

815
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:23,420
Divine, divine, I can't believe I 
can't do it.

816
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,370
Commander, Sniper 1, I news.

817
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:28,666
- Crow from the gray dress in the 
viewfinder. <i>- Received Sniper. 
Keep the place tidy.

818
01:02:28,766 --> 01:02:31,182
<i>No, I don't want to go back to 
prison, no, no.</i>

819
01:02:31,282 --> 01:02:33,382
Walter, you're intelligent, eh?

820
01:02:33,593 --> 01:02:36,143
<i>- And it was all over.</i>
- Yes, I know that it's over.

821
01:02:36,243 --> 01:02:39,732
Please, bring here the attorney who 
guarantees me that I go out alive 
from here,

822
01:02:39,832 --> 01:02:43,307
and that I do not fill the barrel... 
you know that's one thing that you do.

823
01:02:43,407 --> 01:02:44,935
I will port the prosecutor,

824
01:02:45,035 --> 01:02:48,364
but, after you have spoken, what will 
you do... will be' exit.

825
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:49,481
<i>Deliver.</i>

826
01:02:49,581 --> 01:02:51,606
- I can only this. <i>- Yes, yes.

827
01:02:51,706 --> 01:02:54,381
<i>I have people above me, far more 
powerful and decide them.</i>

828
01:02:54,481 --> 01:02:56,705
I know, you'. Are things that I 
already know'.

829
01:02:56,805 --> 01:02:59,062
- Give me the straight line. <i>- 
What a bad luck.

830
01:03:00,097 --> 01:03:02,058
<i>The suspect, out of reach.</i>

831
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:03,770
Hello, Miguel.

832
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:08,350
Ole'!

833
01:03:15,914 --> 01:03:17,592
It says that it will deliver'.

834
01:03:17,692 --> 01:03:18,992
And what do you think?

835
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:21,750
There is something strange.

836
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:30,779
What the fuck...

837
01:03:36,276 --> 01:03:37,226
What?

838
01:03:37,616 --> 01:03:40,116
It is overheated. Must cool down.

839
01:03:53,884 --> 01:03:55,873
<i>- Ready?</i>
- Walter, I have here the prosecutor.

840
01:03:55,973 --> 01:03:57,266
- You step. <i>- From.

841
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:59,216
<i>Mario, we need more time.</i>

842
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:00,365
What?

843
01:04:00,465 --> 01:04:02,827
Hi, Walter, are the prosecutor 
Chester.

844
01:04:02,927 --> 01:04:06,469
You overheated the Power: need more 
time for it to cool.

845
01:04:06,569 --> 01:04:08,669
<i>Ready? Ready, ready. Walter?</i>

846
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:11,071
Walter?

847
01:04:13,328 --> 01:04:14,628
Miguel, are you there?

848
01:04:14,736 --> 01:04:16,636
Yeah, I'm with the prosecutor. What?

849
01:04:16,736 --> 01:04:19,511
<i>Ah, that last name said the 
prosecutor? Chester?</i>

850
01:04:19,611 --> 01:04:20,311
You'.

851
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:23,223
That asshole, son of a bitch?

852
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:27,301
Let Alone, Miguel! The last time I 
let' I massacrassero.

853
01:04:27,401 --> 01:04:29,870
<i>That sewer rat not lifted a finger 
for me.</i>

854
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:33,249
- I can assure you that...
- Shut that sewer, delinquent!

855
01:04:33,349 --> 01:04:36,999
Remember how ridevi when the 
commissioner I beat it in the head?

856
01:04:37,099 --> 01:04:38,949
You are confusing the issue, Walter.

857
01:04:39,513 --> 01:04:41,663
I'm embarrassed? I? I'm embarrassed?

858
01:04:41,863 --> 01:04:44,813
<i>Asshole bastard, you put me back 
inside?</i>

859
01:04:44,913 --> 01:04:45,934
<i>Put it in me?</i>

860
01:04:46,034 --> 01:04:49,834
I'll tell you one thing: I costituiro 
only through my lawyer.

861
01:04:50,097 --> 01:04:53,665
Otherwise, don't talk about it. It 
all goes to hell!

862
01:04:54,008 --> 01:04:55,308
Calm Down, Walter.

863
01:04:55,514 --> 01:04:58,036
I calm myself? Fascist shit!!!!

864
01:04:58,136 --> 01:04:59,386
<i>Pass Miguel.</i>

865
01:05:01,976 --> 01:05:04,608
Walter, give me the number of the 
lawyer: we come right away.

866
01:05:04,708 --> 01:05:07,158
<i>So we end up here. Give me the 
number.</i>

867
01:05:07,315 --> 01:05:10,815
Now I'll give you the phone of my 
lawyer, now you do.

868
01:05:13,786 --> 01:05:15,967
- 15-4... <i>- 15-4...

869
01:05:16,067 --> 01:05:18,389
- 6-5-9...
- 6-5-9...

870
01:05:18,592 --> 01:05:20,395
2-8-1-1.

871
01:05:20,649 --> 01:05:22,442
28-11, and the name?

872
01:05:25,822 --> 01:05:27,472
Juan Carlos Mendizabal.

873
01:05:28,468 --> 01:05:31,168
Tell him that you are "the man in the 
gray suit".

874
01:05:34,982 --> 01:05:38,082
Has no doubts about me? Are a person 
above reproach.

875
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:43,204
You and started.

876
01:06:18,890 --> 01:06:22,506
And to get in a second? Tell me how 
many times you and I have to say, for 
god's sake!

877
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:31,550
But it is so hard, I said, his 
story... Is' who'?

878
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:33,414
<u> "- Dr. Mendizabal? <i>- Yes, 
please tell me.</u>

879
01:06:33,514 --> 01:06:36,070
<i>The prosecutor Chester of Procura1 
of San Isidro.</i>

880
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:39,548
Here, now, there is a hostage 
situation at the Banco Rio in Acassuso

881
01:06:39,648 --> 01:06:42,314
and one of the robbers requesting his 
presence.

882
01:06:42,414 --> 01:06:44,071
<i>It seems to be a client of his.</i>

883
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:47,847
Ah, is it so? I have many clients 
tell me at least one name. Who is it 
for?

884
01:06:47,947 --> 01:06:50,110
It is identified as "the man in the 
gray suit".

885
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:52,760
But what a strange thing. If it just 
came out!

886
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:56,322
Doctor, this man has a hostage a lot 
of people, understand me?

887
01:06:56,422 --> 01:06:59,365
Well, give me the address and I am 
soon there.

888
01:06:59,465 --> 01:07:00,769
Libertador and Peru.

889
01:07:00,869 --> 01:07:03,102
Many thanks, I'm already leaving.

890
01:07:03,378 --> 01:07:05,228
- Sonia, I go away.
- Good.

891
01:07:05,737 --> 01:07:06,887
Now is.

892
01:07:19,249 --> 01:07:20,899
You stopped again.

893
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:22,866
How much time remains?

894
01:07:22,966 --> 01:07:24,366
Let's give it 5 minutes.

895
01:07:32,009 --> 01:07:34,309
- Come On, Ferdi.
- Try again.

896
01:07:43,831 --> 01:07:45,731
<i>What? How's it going?</i>

897
01:07:47,849 --> 01:07:48,799
We?

898
01:07:52,842 --> 01:07:53,892
Are you all right?

899
01:07:59,052 --> 01:08:01,298
But, if you the money do not care!

900
01:08:01,398 --> 01:08:03,148
No, it's not the money, no.

901
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:07,913
Brecht wondered if it was worse to 
rob a bank, or who founded it.

902
01:08:08,286 --> 01:08:09,836
You're gìustificandoti.

903
01:08:10,332 --> 01:08:11,282
No. No...

904
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:14,950
I'm not a Robin Hood.

905
01:08:18,298 --> 01:08:21,566
The fact is that they are completely 
taken by this thought.

906
01:08:21,666 --> 01:08:24,666
I get up and go to bed always 
thinking about the plan.

907
01:08:25,774 --> 01:08:27,224
I think it's perfect.

908
01:08:29,395 --> 01:08:32,454
A schedule, Fernando, starts to fail, 
when its creator

909
01:08:32,554 --> 01:08:34,754
he believes he has a perfect plan.

910
01:08:35,318 --> 01:08:37,265
And not the said Brecht.

911
01:08:37,365 --> 01:08:38,415
I say it.

912
01:08:43,033 --> 01:08:43,933
Stage 7:

913
01:08:45,164 --> 01:08:46,614
"Weapons and a handrail".

914
01:08:47,955 --> 01:08:49,305
Weapons and the handrail!

915
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:00,409
Come on, you fool.

916
01:09:04,107 --> 01:09:04,807
Doc.

917
01:09:12,185 --> 01:09:13,085
Move.

918
01:09:26,976 --> 01:09:28,959
<i>The final stage: "Brain and I".</i>

919
01:09:29,059 --> 01:09:29,841
Well.

920
01:09:36,806 --> 01:09:37,634
Walter?

921
01:09:37,734 --> 01:09:40,934
- Have you talked with the lawyer?
- Yes, it's coming.

922
01:09:46,527 --> 01:09:49,727
You know I was thinking, Miguel? That 
we've been here for quite a while.

923
01:09:50,309 --> 01:09:53,198
And before us we would like to eat 
something.

924
01:09:53,298 --> 01:09:54,763
And what do you want to eat?

925
01:09:54,863 --> 01:09:56,413
Ordinaci 5 <i>fugazetas.

926
01:09:56,631 --> 01:09:58,931
Very good, 5 <i>fugazetas. And to 
drink?

927
01:09:59,406 --> 01:10:00,706
Of The Coca-Cole.

928
01:10:03,703 --> 01:10:07,953
<i>That is not one thing long, I 
don't want to spend the afternoon 
aspettandole.</i>

929
01:10:09,472 --> 01:10:10,322
Walter.

930
01:10:11,065 --> 01:10:11,915
Walter?

931
01:10:18,659 --> 01:10:20,150
That bastard...

932
01:10:38,559 --> 01:10:40,876
They were about to exit. Because they 
earn the time?

933
01:10:40,976 --> 01:10:43,826
- For what?
- Stand by blocking the entrances.

934
01:10:44,654 --> 01:10:46,954
Or preparing for a fight. Well.

935
01:10:47,574 --> 01:10:49,309
- But...
- What else can be?

936
01:10:49,409 --> 01:10:50,338
- Sileo?
- What?

937
01:10:50,438 --> 01:10:52,339
- The director of the bank.
- I am the director.

938
01:10:52,439 --> 01:10:56,121
Tell me, are there outputs that are 
not the entrance, the roof or the 
parking lot?

939
01:10:56,221 --> 01:10:58,296
- I haven't said enough?
- Answer me.

940
01:10:58,396 --> 01:11:00,257
- Not there is not other.
- Sure?

941
01:11:00,357 --> 01:11:01,764
You'. Please.

942
01:11:01,993 --> 01:11:04,183
- Take care of the people.
- And that we do here?

943
01:11:04,283 --> 01:11:06,272
- But if I go!
- Is, please.

944
01:11:12,706 --> 01:11:15,206
- And, who pays me?
- Now you pay for it.

945
01:11:17,056 --> 01:11:18,706
Head, came the pizzas.

946
01:11:18,806 --> 01:11:21,927
<i>The number required and' out of 
the coverage area.</i>

947
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:28,999
<i>The number required and' out of 
the coverage area.</i>

948
01:11:29,099 --> 01:11:30,249
That bastard.

949
01:11:36,705 --> 01:11:37,905
Keep you money.

950
01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:30,280
Well.

951
01:12:31,502 --> 01:12:32,752
Who said that?

952
01:12:37,016 --> 01:12:39,066
Who is talking, eh?

953
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:40,880
Who was it?

954
01:12:41,496 --> 01:12:43,096
What do you mean, Mario?

955
01:12:43,575 --> 01:12:46,175
Around, she started running to the 
voice.

956
01:12:46,617 --> 01:12:48,967
You speak already also of Banco Rio.

957
01:12:49,307 --> 01:12:52,119
A shame, I thought we were 
professionals.

958
01:12:52,219 --> 01:12:53,919
Here, no one opens his mouth.

959
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,820
Well, nice that you say this. This...

960
01:12:57,295 --> 01:12:59,345
and that's what I want to ascertain.

961
01:12:59,545 --> 01:13:03,295
- Maybe talk about another 'job'.
- You say? Well, it can be.

962
01:13:03,395 --> 01:13:06,245
- Is' calm, Mario.
- Quiet? They are quite calm.

963
01:13:06,901 --> 01:13:09,504
I just want to know who he spoke too.

964
01:13:10,002 --> 01:13:11,252
- Ferdi.
- Huh?

965
01:13:11,926 --> 01:13:13,838
Mario, you say crap.

966
01:13:14,374 --> 01:13:15,074
You'?

967
01:13:15,949 --> 01:13:18,231
- I say bullshit?
- Yes, you.

968
01:13:18,331 --> 01:13:19,481
Fermo, Fermo.

969
01:13:19,581 --> 01:13:22,874
- Saw that says this jerk?
- Is', is' stationary. Stop!

970
01:13:22,974 --> 01:13:25,182
- I say bullshit?
- You' that you say.

971
01:13:25,282 --> 01:13:27,032
Just, Mario, put down.

972
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:29,210
Mario, put down the gun.

973
01:13:30,533 --> 01:13:32,433
Those who have spoken, holy shit?

974
01:13:35,312 --> 01:13:37,012
It's a toy, you fool.

975
01:13:38,473 --> 01:13:40,166
Your sister, the whore, the uruguayan.

976
01:13:40,266 --> 01:13:43,199
Sorry, I'm sorry, boys, but we wanted 
it to be clear

977
01:13:43,299 --> 01:13:46,337
an important point: we will not go 
into the bank with real weapons,

978
01:13:46,437 --> 01:13:49,187
- we'll use the replicas.
- Replicas!

979
01:13:49,964 --> 01:13:52,885
- Is it a joke?
- You drink you will drink all.

980
01:13:52,985 --> 01:13:56,239
Not like this, someone to whom 
trembled the hand and escaped the 
blow.

981
01:13:56,339 --> 01:13:58,546
And if he escapes them, and we have 
to defend ourselves?

982
01:13:58,646 --> 01:14:02,154
After the massacre of Ramallo, any 
police officer osera join the bank.

983
01:14:02,254 --> 01:14:04,579
Until there will be hostages, not 
sparera' a shot.

984
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:06,379
And then, if we take...

985
01:14:06,604 --> 01:14:07,804
replicas...

986
01:14:08,243 --> 01:14:09,990
we will avoid several years in.

987
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:12,509
Believe me, the plan is perfect as is.

988
01:14:12,609 --> 01:14:15,334
However, if someone has doubts, 
expresses them now.

989
01:14:15,434 --> 01:14:18,884
Yes, I will. How will the police that 
we use replicas?

990
01:14:25,004 --> 01:14:27,304
All quiet, eh? Plan, where you are.

991
01:14:27,993 --> 01:14:30,043
No, giu', giu', giu' look.

992
01:14:30,608 --> 01:14:32,108
So. Strength, as well.

993
01:14:32,767 --> 01:14:36,206
Quiet, that comes the pizzas...

994
01:14:47,357 --> 01:14:51,729
<i>Hey, what are you watching this 
movie.</i>

995
01:14:52,134 --> 01:14:57,127
<i>We would like you to know that if 
I had not found the credits</i>

996
01:14:57,474 --> 01:15:02,598
<i>know that these subtitles were 
made</i>

997
01:15:03,011 --> 01:15:08,468
<i>from the S|R|T| p|r|o|j|e|c|t, and 
then stolen from the site in which 
your are seeing the film.</i>

998
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:13,375
<i>Good day!</i>

999
01:15:26,743 --> 01:15:29,815
I don't know how they did it, but 
they came from the bank.

1000
01:15:29,915 --> 01:15:31,961
To the sewers. Know that you must do?

1001
01:15:32,061 --> 01:15:35,768
Those of Ramirez entering from the 
sewers, we enter from above, and them 
we encase.

1002
01:15:35,868 --> 01:15:37,043
- No.
- Why not?

1003
01:15:37,143 --> 01:15:38,938
Don't know if I am inside or not.

1004
01:15:39,038 --> 01:15:40,923
You can not give him any more time!

1005
01:15:41,023 --> 01:15:43,537
Come to that, don't you see? Not have 
a telephone,

1006
01:15:43,637 --> 01:15:46,730
do not withdraw from the pizza, the 
signal tells us that in the bank 
there is no.

1007
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:48,616
- What evidence do you want?
- I do not mix.

1008
01:15:48,716 --> 01:15:50,382
- It is not so.
- Confuses me!

1009
01:15:50,482 --> 01:15:52,516
I say no and it is I who command!

1010
01:15:52,616 --> 01:15:53,916
- You'...
- Ti sanziono!

1011
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:56,265
- Does not see the reality!
- It is not enough to enter.

1012
01:15:56,365 --> 01:15:58,137
There was a fork in the road, that 
the head will fall'?

1013
01:15:58,237 --> 01:16:00,619
- What the fork!
- That the head will be, Miguel? 
Clear?

1014
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:04,367
- My sister is calling from inside!
- It puts in danger the life, lady!

1015
01:16:04,467 --> 01:16:06,535
- Ready?
- Please, let me go.

1016
01:16:06,635 --> 01:16:10,025
Close the phone, please! Please turn 
off your mobiles!

1017
01:16:10,125 --> 01:16:13,225
- Is calling them'!
- Call from inside, the head.

1018
01:16:14,655 --> 01:16:17,350
Please turn off cell phones, for the 
good of your family!

1019
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:19,804
- Prepare to enter.
- Turn off all mobile phones.

1020
01:16:23,819 --> 01:16:25,569
Raggruppatevi! Advance!

1021
01:16:59,143 --> 01:17:00,643
Attention! The police!

1022
01:17:00,936 --> 01:17:01,993
The police!

1023
01:17:46,479 --> 01:17:47,979
Out! Out! Out!

1024
01:17:56,219 --> 01:17:58,394
- What's this, now?
- It happens,

1025
01:17:58,494 --> 01:18:00,969
want to save money on the engine, 
holy cow!

1026
01:18:01,069 --> 01:18:03,252
I told you the price of a new one, 
and you liked it.

1027
01:18:03,352 --> 01:18:06,423
You said you'd rebuilt again. We have 
millions of dollars,

1028
01:18:06,523 --> 01:18:08,830
- what are two thousand <i>pesos?
- You say it now, Felicio.

1029
01:18:08,930 --> 01:18:11,130
We are ready. Let's go with the oars.

1030
01:18:11,905 --> 01:18:14,396
And with the money? How to do it?

1031
01:18:15,602 --> 01:18:17,934
Are many miles to bring them to the 
feet.

1032
01:18:18,034 --> 01:18:20,259
Yes, we will more than three hours, 
you'.

1033
01:18:20,359 --> 01:18:22,101
I thought of the use of the rafts.

1034
01:18:22,201 --> 01:18:23,991
Motor? There is no' depth'.

1035
01:18:24,091 --> 01:18:27,771
Then, if they discover the what of 
the sewers, will be waiting for us in 
the river.

1036
01:18:27,871 --> 01:18:29,271
Them, we are fried.

1037
01:18:29,778 --> 01:18:32,528
- He's right.
- We could build a dam.

1038
01:18:33,539 --> 01:18:35,689
- Done? Are we going to?
- Come on, come on!

1039
01:18:35,789 --> 01:18:37,767
So, so! Straight, straight!!!

1040
01:18:37,867 --> 01:18:38,922
By, by, by!

1041
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:41,381
Come on, come on, come on! Let's go!

1042
01:18:41,913 --> 01:18:43,727
So. We continue! We continue, as well.

1043
01:18:43,827 --> 01:18:45,759
To the left, to the left.

1044
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:09,640
Help me!

1045
01:19:12,908 --> 01:19:14,747
- Li I am chasing!
- There are traps!

1046
01:19:14,847 --> 01:19:15,897
Them I choose!

1047
01:19:16,154 --> 01:19:18,104
Go! Go, more strong! Force!

1048
01:19:19,947 --> 01:19:21,247
Go, go, go...

1049
01:19:25,402 --> 01:19:27,302
Come on, let's go, come on. Let's go.

1050
01:19:39,474 --> 01:19:40,874
Well, Mario, good.

1051
01:19:46,006 --> 01:19:48,545
Lord, I have news. The weapons found 
are replicas.

1052
01:19:48,645 --> 01:19:50,245
<i>I repeat, they are replicas.</i>

1053
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:15,224
Nutria1, to Nutria2, do you hear me?

1054
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:30,140
- Nutria1, to Nutria2, do you hear me?
- I hear you.

1055
01:21:18,588 --> 01:21:19,288
By!

1056
01:21:47,876 --> 01:21:50,559
- Police! Identify!
- Are There!

1057
01:22:40,313 --> 01:22:41,263
No, No...

1058
01:22:45,308 --> 01:22:48,458
This has to be the pickup truck the 
most expensive in the world.

1059
01:23:02,884 --> 01:23:04,727
<i>Banco Rio</i>

1060
01:23:20,108 --> 01:23:21,919
That son of a bitch!

1061
01:23:54,781 --> 01:23:58,544
<i>In the neighborhood of rich men, 
without arms, nor grudges.</i>

1062
01:23:58,644 --> 01:24:01,162
<i>Are only money and not love.</i>

1063
01:25:04,053 --> 01:25:05,153
Amazing!

1064
01:25:30,590 --> 01:25:32,340
Congratulations, guys.

1065
01:25:33,943 --> 01:25:35,957
Congratulations. Really.

1066
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:39,240
Now, a low profile.

1067
01:25:40,353 --> 01:25:41,553
And discretion.

1068
01:26:19,491 --> 01:26:22,302
<i>In the history of argentina, I 
can't remember a band that</i>

1069
01:26:22,402 --> 01:26:25,612
<i>he has acted with so much 
organization, a lot of technique, or 
lots of luck,</i>

1070
01:26:25,712 --> 01:26:28,210
<i>as that which made the robbery of 
the Banco Rio.</i>

1071
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:31,460
<i>Obviously a band very 
well-prepared, but be assured...</i>

1072
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:34,753
<i>all, that soon they will be in 
prison, to drink mate.</i>

1074
01:28:57,217 --> 01:28:57,957
Name?

1075
01:28:59,730 --> 01:29:01,280
My, or my husband?

1076
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:02,530
Him.

1077
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:05,180
Alberto de la Torre, my husband.

1078
01:29:06,233 --> 01:29:09,233
And that's what he robbed the bank. 
The Tour Rio.

1079
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:12,500
- As he robbed the bank?
- You'.

1080
01:29:12,836 --> 01:29:15,486
There are all the money from me, in 
the ceiling.

1081
01:29:17,153 --> 01:29:19,957
- Want to write down the address?
- A moment, please.

1082
01:29:20,057 --> 01:29:21,107
A moment.

1084
01:29:35,101 --> 01:29:36,815
Stop! Sta' fermo!

1085
01:29:37,823 --> 01:29:40,807
- Force the son of a bitch!
- Why I have stopped, the cow trojan!

1086
01:29:40,907 --> 01:29:42,495
Calm down, you son of a bitch!

1087
01:29:42,595 --> 01:29:44,041
Fottetevi all of you!

1088
01:29:44,141 --> 01:29:45,745
That bitch who made you!

1089
01:29:45,845 --> 01:29:47,191
- And-down!
- Do not touch me!

1090
01:29:47,291 --> 01:29:49,091
- Stop!
- Do not touch me!

1091
01:29:50,899 --> 01:29:52,299
Your mother whore!

1092
01:29:55,806 --> 01:29:57,206
Your mother whore!

1093
01:30:16,374 --> 01:30:19,386
<i>Ruben "Beto" de la Torre has just 
been caught,</i>

1094
01:30:19,486 --> 01:30:21,629
<i>after a chase spectacular.</i>

1095
01:30:21,729 --> 01:30:25,127
<i>That would be one of the robbers, 
Banco Rio.</i>

1096
01:30:33,421 --> 01:30:37,021
They are looking for the one that has 
designed the blow to the Tour Rio.

1097
01:30:37,892 --> 01:30:39,342
And' in these parts?

1098
01:30:40,946 --> 01:30:42,778
What they will never find him.

1099
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:46,411
The people of Buenos Aires told me 
how it all went.

1100
01:30:46,511 --> 01:30:47,811
And how did that go?

1101
01:30:48,297 --> 01:30:51,147
Reached Montevideo, are passed in 
Brazil.

1102
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:53,382
Li' have already' invested everything.

1103
01:30:53,482 --> 01:30:56,132
The creator of the hit not any.

1104
01:30:56,264 --> 01:30:59,496
It is a political and very very 
well-known Buenos Aires.

1105
01:30:59,596 --> 01:31:03,396
At this time, will be in Miami, or an 
island where nobody knows.

1106
01:31:04,771 --> 01:31:06,521
You will never who it is.

1107
01:31:21,767 --> 01:31:23,556
With that of iron near a cover.

1108
01:31:23,656 --> 01:31:26,156
- I can bring the car in the night?
- You'.

1109
01:31:27,392 --> 01:31:29,892
Hey, is' stop it! Sta' fermo! Fermo 
li'!

1110
01:31:30,553 --> 01:31:32,804
- Power on!
- By!

1111
01:31:33,982 --> 01:31:35,708
Dale

1112
01:32:11,552 --> 01:32:14,752
It was very good. I've just 
surprised. Very well.

1113
01:32:20,892 --> 01:32:21,642
What?

1114
01:32:24,546 --> 01:32:26,096
What? By, what?

1115
01:32:29,227 --> 01:32:29,927
From.

1116
01:32:31,648 --> 01:32:34,055
Does not begin the game? Put it on, 
come on.

1117
01:32:34,155 --> 01:32:36,755
Do you want to see a movie? For me 
it's the same.

1118
01:32:38,559 --> 01:32:39,909
You put the game.

1119
01:32:42,311 --> 01:32:44,261
And if better still switch it off?

1120
01:32:45,407 --> 01:32:46,357
Turn.

1121
01:32:46,521 --> 01:32:48,421
So we are talking about. Better, no?

1122
01:33:25,312 --> 01:33:26,502
- Come On, Lu.
- What?

1123
01:33:26,602 --> 01:33:28,570
- Come on, not nothing.
- What happens?

1124
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:30,573
- Come on, get here!
- But, dad!

1125
01:33:30,673 --> 01:33:32,622
- Stay here!
- Pope', what happens?

1126
01:33:32,722 --> 01:33:36,522
Close the door, Lu, please! It 
remains to them'! Remains them', I 
said.

1127
01:33:37,163 --> 01:33:39,413
If you ask questions, it remains 
inside!

1128
01:33:42,048 --> 01:33:42,948
The police!

1129
01:33:43,287 --> 01:33:44,987
Done! Shot! To the ground!

1130
01:33:45,339 --> 01:33:47,889
On the ground, I said, lie down. To 
the ground!

1131
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:52,250
Deliver me, you son of a bitch!

1132
01:33:52,350 --> 01:33:54,350
Release the bullet, not the tap!

1133
01:33:54,450 --> 01:33:56,950
- Pope'!
- Take the handcuffs. Toglile!

1134
01:34:09,871 --> 01:34:11,721
Received, the basis. There is another 
one?

1135
01:34:12,349 --> 01:34:15,692
<i>Male 38 years has taken hostage 
the wife.</i>

1136
01:34:16,624 --> 01:34:18,674
That we are there' in 5 minutes.

1137
01:34:18,774 --> 01:34:21,424
<i>Head, they took Walter, Banco 
Rio.</i>

1138
01:34:22,361 --> 01:34:24,111
I don't give a fuck.

1139
01:34:37,207 --> 01:34:38,578
With me, doll!

1140
01:34:43,046 --> 01:34:45,136
As I miss you, beautiful brunette!

1141
01:34:53,417 --> 01:34:54,417
How are you?

1142
01:35:05,126 --> 01:35:07,312
Listen, I've talked with lawyers...

1143
01:35:21,576 --> 01:35:22,776
Forgive Me, Lu.

1144
01:35:25,069 --> 01:35:26,069
Forgive me.

1145
01:35:28,922 --> 01:35:30,722
I apologize for everything.

1146
01:35:32,468 --> 01:35:35,118
For all the shit that I've done and 
for...

1147
01:35:39,357 --> 01:35:41,857
what I did suffer from a small.

1148
01:35:45,094 --> 01:35:48,194
For all the lies that I said to you, 
forgive me.

1149
01:35:51,505 --> 01:35:52,455
I know that...

1150
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:57,041
this you have already heard many 
times, Lu...

1151
01:35:57,913 --> 01:35:59,363
but now it's over.

1152
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:00,520
And it was all over.

1153
01:36:02,017 --> 01:36:03,117
Ends here.

1154
01:36:04,042 --> 01:36:04,992
Never more'.

1155
01:36:06,110 --> 01:36:07,010
Really.

1156
01:36:12,863 --> 01:36:14,663
And today I wanted to see you...

1157
01:36:17,181 --> 01:36:20,081
'cause I wanted to look you in the 
eye and tell you.

1158
01:36:24,896 --> 01:36:25,946
And that...

1159
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:27,739
you trust...

1160
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:30,289
that what daddy tells you...

1161
01:36:31,635 --> 01:36:33,135
today, and' the truth'.

1162
01:36:36,649 --> 01:36:38,049
I understand all of this, eh?

1163
01:36:39,076 --> 01:36:40,276
I understand all of this.

1164
01:36:41,036 --> 01:36:42,336
Your anger...

1165
01:36:43,303 --> 01:36:44,653
your anger...

1166
01:36:47,342 --> 01:36:50,542
- you', that you're in the mood...
- Of punching?

1167
01:36:52,742 --> 01:36:54,542
To take a punch, you'.

1168
01:37:33,105 --> 01:37:35,997
<i>If you put yourself to think about 
the men the most important in the 
History,</i>

1169
01:37:36,097 --> 01:37:38,008
<i>families more powerful,</i>

1170
01:37:39,036 --> 01:37:42,977
always you will find of the murky, 
something dark.

1171
01:37:43,234 --> 01:37:46,634
As if they had understood that in 
order to emerge, first,

1172
01:37:47,348 --> 01:37:48,798
they had to "get dirty".

1173
01:37:50,123 --> 01:37:52,923
But, do you feel "dirty" for what you 
do?

1174
01:37:54,289 --> 01:37:54,939
No.

1175
01:37:58,232 --> 01:37:59,832
Should I worry about it?

1176
01:38:01,618 --> 01:38:02,718
What would you say?

1177
01:38:07,842 --> 01:38:09,592
You did a good job.

1178
01:38:11,089 --> 01:38:14,164
No, since that will be our last 
session, you say, Daniel,

1179
01:38:14,264 --> 01:38:16,214
you did a great job.

1180
01:38:17,025 --> 01:38:20,375
Because you seem to have done a good 
job with you?

1181
01:38:22,243 --> 01:38:25,993
Why, a week before committing the 
robbery of the century,

1182
01:38:27,901 --> 01:38:31,008
I feel the man... more "clean" in the 
world.

1183
01:38:49,294 --> 01:38:50,694
- Salve.
- Salve.

1184
01:38:52,112 --> 01:38:55,162
- What makes these parts?
- A spiritual retreat.

1185
01:38:56,134 --> 01:38:57,734
Is there any problem?

1186
01:38:58,737 --> 01:38:59,737
Documents?

1187
01:39:02,091 --> 01:39:04,687
Ah, what a fool! I left them in the 
hotel.

1188
01:39:04,787 --> 01:39:07,837
That's stupid. I could not be more. 
Excuse me.

1189
01:39:08,247 --> 01:39:10,347
The sorry if we take a look?

1190
01:39:12,308 --> 01:39:13,308
I have a choice?

1191
01:39:28,862 --> 01:39:30,753
Fuck... what can you do.

1192
01:39:38,403 --> 01:39:41,280
Command, attention. It seems we have 
the suspect that you are looking for.

1193
01:40:05,122 --> 01:40:05,895
Thanks.

1194
01:40:05,995 --> 01:40:07,731
Araujo! Take away everything!

1195
01:40:24,431 --> 01:40:25,831
Good-Bye, Luis.

1196
01:40:41,823 --> 01:40:43,323
God be thanked for it.

1197
01:40:46,145 --> 01:40:47,645
Exit clean, from them'?

1198
01:40:48,608 --> 01:40:49,547
And the aunt?

1199
01:40:49,862 --> 01:40:52,062
The aunt? The aunt and remained 
inside.

1200
01:40:52,423 --> 01:40:53,273
Watch.

1201
01:40:53,373 --> 01:40:55,859
<i>Today they release the inventor of 
the blow to the Tour Rio.</i>

1202
01:40:55,959 --> 01:40:57,159
Ah, but look at it.

1203
01:40:58,008 --> 01:40:59,958
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1204
01:41:01,453 --> 01:41:03,403
I piacevi with the jacket, eh!

1205
01:41:03,757 --> 01:41:05,957
But, this also not is evil.

1206
01:41:06,296 --> 01:41:08,146
I can't say the same...

1207
01:41:16,543 --> 01:41:19,293
- What are you doing here?
- No, don't be disappointed.

1208
01:41:19,894 --> 01:41:22,844
Are in a temporary exit. At 20 I have 
to go back.

1209
01:41:23,462 --> 01:41:25,112
Take it as a farewell.

1210
01:41:25,508 --> 01:41:26,958
Already, so soon?

1211
01:41:28,626 --> 01:41:30,876
You know that we can make a slaughter 
of us, no, Mario?

1212
01:41:30,976 --> 01:41:33,351
- I am retired, Fernando.
- You'...

1213
01:41:33,451 --> 01:41:34,351
I, too.

1214
01:41:35,765 --> 01:41:38,965
- The goodness of the guards.
- Even with that, my God!

1215
01:41:40,319 --> 01:41:42,619
- I focuses.
- Ti 'focus'...

1216
01:41:48,861 --> 01:41:49,932
Concentrated.

1217
01:41:50,032 --> 01:41:52,232
After so much insistence... let's See.

1218
01:41:53,311 --> 01:41:54,511
Deeply.

1219
01:41:57,661 --> 01:41:59,171
- And?
- Ti centers.

1220
01:41:59,271 --> 01:42:01,303
- Visa?
- You concentrate, yes, yes.

1221
01:42:01,403 --> 01:42:03,431
Uh, and how! That strong!

1222
01:42:04,781 --> 01:42:06,431
But go to hell, you fool!

1223
01:42:33,361 --> 01:42:35,645
<i>It was a blow carefully 
planned.</i>

1224
01:42:35,745 --> 01:42:39,699
<i>The robbers fled with money and 
jewelry safes,</i>

1225
01:42:39,799 --> 01:42:43,592
<i>through a tunnel dug in the 
subsoil, where they had put</i>

1226
01:42:43,692 --> 01:42:46,692
<i>booby traps, to avoid the 
pursuits.</i>

1227
01:42:47,456 --> 01:42:51,934
<i>The dinghy was found in a canal 
that runs right under the bank.</i>

1228
01:42:52,791 --> 01:42:54,956
<i>Let's see if, before the 
process,</i>

1229
01:42:55,163 --> 01:42:58,084
<i>you will be able to clarify what 
happened with "the robbery of the 
century".</i>

1230
01:42:58,184 --> 01:43:00,434
<i>And also because, of all the 
money,</i>

1231
01:43:00,797 --> 01:43:02,897
<i>there were not even the coins.</i>

1232
01:43:08,005 --> 01:43:10,373
<i>5 people</i>

1233
01:43:10,473 --> 01:43:12,634
<i>were sentenced for the 
so-called:</i>

1234
01:43:12,734 --> 01:43:17,463
<i>"The robbery of the century"</i>

1235
01:43:17,563 --> 01:43:19,348
<i>The pains were</i>

1236
01:43:19,448 --> 01:43:22,169
<i>from 7 to 15 years.</i>

1237
01:43:22,269 --> 01:43:25,216
<i>I was in Montevideo when you 
robbed the bank!</i>

1238
01:43:25,316 --> 01:43:28,634
<i>The Court of criminal appeal 
reduced the penis</i>

1239

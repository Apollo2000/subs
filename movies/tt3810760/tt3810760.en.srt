1
00:00:19,054 --> 00:00:20,848
So much of our life is

2
00:00:20,873 --> 00:00:25,165
lived in a fog of automatic
habitual behavior.

3
00:00:28,857 --> 00:00:32,360
We spend so much time on the hunt.

4
00:00:34,779 --> 00:00:37,599
But nothing ever quite does it for us.
[DAN HARRIS   AUTHOR, 10% HAPPIER]

5
00:00:37,825 --> 00:00:43,315
And we get so wrapped up in the hunt
that it kind of makes us miserable.

6
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,331
And I had everything I ever wanted.

7
00:01:28,924 --> 00:01:31,528
I had everything I
was supposed to have.

8
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:38,076
Everyone around me said:
"You're successful."

9
00:01:40,395 --> 00:01:43,030
But really, I was miserable.

10
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:47,608
There was this ...

11
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,352
gaping...
[RYAN NICODEMUS  THE MINIMALISTS]

12
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:51,472
... void in my life.
[RYAN NICODEMUS  THE MINIMALISTS]

13
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:56,284
So... I tried to fill that void
the same way many people do:

14
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,643
with stuff... lots of stuff.

15
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:03,622
I was filling the void
with consumer purchases.

16
00:02:05,628 --> 00:02:08,997
I was spending money faster
than I was earning it,

17
00:02:09,465 --> 00:02:11,839
attempting to buy
my way to happiness.

18
00:02:13,886 --> 00:02:15,763
I thought I'd get there one day.

19
00:02:16,764 --> 00:02:19,476
Eventually, I mean,
happiness had to be

20
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,062
somewhere, just
around the corner.

21
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,524
I was living paycheck to paycheck,

22
00:02:25,774 --> 00:02:30,028
living for a paycheck,
living for stuff.

23
00:02:31,573 --> 00:02:34,474
But I wasn't living at all.

24
00:02:47,882 --> 00:02:50,943
At a time when people in the West

25
00:02:50,968 --> 00:02:55,003
are experiencing the best
standard of living in history,

26
00:02:55,974 --> 00:02:58,144
why, is it at the same time...
[Rick Hanson, PhD in Neurophysiologist]

27
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:00,226
there is such a longing for more?
[Rick Hanson, PhD in Neurophysiologist]

28
00:03:02,606 --> 00:03:07,421
I think of that as a kind of
biologically based delusional craving.

29
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:13,117
That autocraving is a good
strategy to keep animals alive,

30
00:03:13,147 --> 00:03:15,119
including early human animals,

31
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:16,752
in really harsh conditions.

32
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:21,946
But these days today,
it creates a disconnect.

33
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:26,298
You're like a puppet, whose strings

34
00:03:26,323 --> 00:03:29,359
should be pulled by Mother
Nature and evolution,

35
00:03:29,384 --> 00:03:32,137
reaching back tens
of millions of years.

36
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:35,225
We still feel restless.

37
00:03:35,308 --> 00:03:37,681
We still are always scratching
and calling for more.

38
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:42,982
It's why lottery winners are miserable.

39
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:46,539
It's why homeowners
have three car garages.

40
00:03:48,197 --> 00:03:50,342
The first car generates an exponential...
[Jesse Jacobs, Entrepreneur]

41
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:53,335
awesome rush of happiness, joy and utility.
[Jesse Jacobs, Entrepreneur]

42
00:03:53,536 --> 00:03:56,795
The second car comes about
because we tire of the first car.

43
00:03:56,824 --> 00:03:59,842
And, as humans, we're wired
to become dissatisfied.

44
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:02,765
It's an addiction, really.

45
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:08,515
And we are encouraged to
maintain the addiction

46
00:04:08,635 --> 00:04:10,221
through technology and information.

47
00:04:13,516 --> 00:04:16,085
American culture has ...
[Shannon Whitehead, Sustainable-Apparel]

48
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,984
for the most part, these blinders on.
[Shannon Whitehead, Sustainable-Apparel]

49
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,694
There is definitely this illusion
of what our lives should look like.

50
00:04:25,153 --> 00:04:29,291
Whether it's advertising,
or your Instagram,

51
00:04:29,316 --> 00:04:33,245
or Facebook feed, it's this illusion

52
00:04:33,328 --> 00:04:34,956
that our lives should be perfect.

53
00:04:36,499 --> 00:04:39,871
It's natural to use
other people's lives,

54
00:04:39,973 --> 00:04:41,594
and even imaginary lives, you know ...
[Sam Harris, PhD, Neuroscientist]

55
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:43,343
the confections we see in
[Sam Harris, PhD, Neuroscientist]

56
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,773
advertisements, as a yardstick.

57
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:50,139
You open Vanity Fair
or Esquire and you see

58
00:04:50,222 --> 00:04:53,569
very sexy and glamorous lives.

59
00:04:54,018 --> 00:04:56,770
And then the projects for
most people seem to become:

60
00:04:56,854 --> 00:05:00,568
"How can I get that or close
to that as I'm going to get?"

61
00:05:01,443 --> 00:05:03,987
There can be an immense
amount of dissatisfaction

62
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,488
for trying to live that way.

63
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:08,783
And many of us see no
alternative to live that way.

64
00:05:12,622 --> 00:05:15,314
Advertising has polluted...
[Juliet Schor,  PhD, Economist]

65
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:17,752
...and infiltrated culture.
[Juliet Schor,  PhD, Economist]

66
00:05:17,835 --> 00:05:19,347
It's in our movies.

67
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:22,289
It's in our television shows.

68
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:23,966
It's in our books.

69
00:05:24,467 --> 00:05:26,261
It's in our doctors' offices.

70
00:05:26,345 --> 00:05:28,263
It's in the taxicabs.

71
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:33,048
It's in the bar, sitting next
to you, the person who you think

72
00:05:33,073 --> 00:05:35,668
you're just having and idle
chat with could have been

73
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:38,232
placed there by an
alcohol company.

74
00:05:39,003 --> 00:05:40,527
Hydrate the Hustle

75
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:43,512
It's been a slow evolution.

76
00:05:43,537 --> 00:05:46,206
This is not something that
just happened yesterday.

77
00:05:47,116 --> 00:05:51,038
This is something that has been sold
to us, I would say, the past 100 years,

78
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:55,250
slowly but surely, by those that
want to make a lot of money.

79
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:58,545
Now that's what I call
a good looking car.

80
00:05:59,088 --> 00:06:00,964
They want us to believe that ...
[Patrick Rhone, Author, ENOUGH]

81
00:06:00,989 --> 00:06:04,045
you really need these things.
[Patrick Rhone, Author, ENOUGH]

82
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,625
Every year that passes
has more stimulators,

83
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,350
more pressure,
there's more options,

84
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,583
there's more media,
more noise, noise, noise.

85
00:06:14,104 --> 00:06:17,499
And by streamlining, simplifying and just
[Yarrow Kraner, Director & Photographer]

86
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:19,356
letting people know
they have the option,

87
00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:24,916
is a wake up call that
is very valuable in

88
00:06:24,941 --> 00:06:26,684
in a very critical time now.

89
00:06:36,878 --> 00:06:38,980
It got to a point in my life

90
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:43,202
where I don't what was
important any more.

91
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:51,114
Then, at some point when I
was approaching 30 year old,

92
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,740
I noticed something
different about my best friend

93
00:06:53,765 --> 00:06:55,149
of twenty something years.

94
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,833
Josh, he seemed happy
for the first time

95
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:01,800
in a really long time,
like truly happy, ecstatic.

96
00:07:02,906 --> 00:07:05,752
But I didn't understand
why, because we had both

97
00:07:05,777 --> 00:07:07,116
worked at the same corporation.

98
00:07:07,182 --> 00:07:10,165
We both wasted our twenties climbing
the corporate ladder together,

99
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:13,407
and he had been just
as miserable as me.

100
00:07:14,627 --> 00:07:16,463
So I did what any good
best friend would do.

101
00:07:16,546 --> 00:07:18,382
I took him out to a
really nice lunch...

102
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:21,802
I think we went to the Subway.
And I sat him down

103
00:07:21,886 --> 00:07:23,763
and I asked him a question.

104
00:07:25,347 --> 00:07:26,912
Why the hell are you so happy?

105
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:33,520
He spends the next 20 minutes telling
me about this thing called minimalism.

106
00:07:37,736 --> 00:07:39,946
Before I discovered minimalism,

107
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,409
I think my life was like
pretty much anyone elses.

108
00:07:44,285 --> 00:07:45,753
I had a lot of stuff.

109
00:07:46,954 --> 00:07:51,959
Hundreds, thousands of
books, DVDs and VHSs,

110
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,005
closets full of expensive clothes.

111
00:07:55,714 --> 00:08:00,719
All these things that I brought
into my life without questioning.

112
00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:03,597
But when I started to let it go,

113
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,724
I started feeling freer and happier
[Joshua Fields Millburn]

114
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:07,863
and lighter. And now as...
[The Minimilists]

115
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:11,940
a minimalist, every
possession serves a purpose,

116
00:08:12,273 --> 00:08:13,691
or brings me joy.

117
00:08:15,568 --> 00:08:19,407
I have a bed and a chair, and a radio.

118
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,785
And I have some furniture
in my dining room.

119
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:25,074
In my kitchen I have appliances.

120
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:28,381
I don't have any excess stuff.

121
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:32,629
Everything that I look around

122
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,924
I have to go and justify to
myself, not to anyone else,

123
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:40,032
but justify to myself: "Does
this add value to my life?"

124
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,988
And if not, I have to
be willing to let go.

125
00:08:48,938 --> 00:08:53,109
Ryan and I just writing a book
about the last five years of our lives,

126
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:57,982
It's from being these suit and
tie corporate guys, to minimalists.

127
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:01,658
And so, now we gonna get on
the road for ten months this year

128
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,329
and promote that book.

129
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,498
But really for all the
message we really believe in.

130
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:11,811
A simple living message of:
living more deliberately with less.

131
00:09:11,991 --> 00:09:13,690
Oh! I'm gonna need a jacket.

132
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,805
We'll see where the
journey will take us.

133
00:09:29,982 --> 00:09:32,985
MUSIC FILM INTERACTIVE

134
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:36,823
So you presented it as a
12 minute talk 8 minute reading.

135
00:09:37,288 --> 00:09:38,163
- Okay.
- Yeah.

136
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:39,284
Cool.

137
00:09:39,507 --> 00:09:41,813
Cause I just don't want to feel
rushed in the talk, that's all.

138
00:09:41,995 --> 00:09:43,121
Right.

139
00:09:43,246 --> 00:09:47,282
Early into their tour Joshua & Ryan
land a speaking gig at South by Southwest.

140
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:50,801
They hope it will bring their
story to a larger audience

141
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:53,462
- Ready?
- I was born ready.

142
00:09:53,487 --> 00:09:54,550
Nice.

143
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,678
Hello, thanks for coming out.

144
00:09:57,762 --> 00:10:02,116
My name is Ryan Nicodemus and
this is the Joshua Fields Millburn.

145
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:06,146
And together we run a website
called theminimalists.com.

146
00:10:08,023 --> 00:10:10,984
So today, Josh is gonna
read from our new book.

147
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,975
But first let me tell
you a story about how

148
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,530
we become the Minimalists.

149
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,327
We've never been shut out, so as
long as one person shows up...

150
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,546
- That's all that matters.
- I feel really good.

151
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,541
We've had events where you
had two people show up,

152
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,835
and that was amazing,

153
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,922
because we got to spend time
with two people and add value

154
00:10:29,947 --> 00:10:31,605
to their lives in a different way.

155
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,442
- I'm a hugger, man.
- Okay.

156
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,063
Thanks for coming out, man.

157
00:10:35,945 --> 00:10:37,555
Thanks for coming out
and seeing the talk, man.

158
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,282
- For sure. Thank you.
- Our pleasure.

159
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:41,142
Did you forget your
Kindle and badge in there?

160
00:10:41,351 --> 00:10:42,602
Oh yes. Thank you.

161
00:10:53,155 --> 00:10:56,075
From the day I was born

162
00:10:56,283 --> 00:11:00,746
until the second grade, when
my parents got divorced,

163
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:07,411
I had like the perfect
quintessential mom and dad.

164
00:11:08,797 --> 00:11:10,700
When my mom left my dad,

165
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:14,279
she just really went
off the deep end.

166
00:11:15,638 --> 00:11:20,309
By junior high, we had a lot
of people over at the house.

167
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:25,398
And later I found out they
were in there smoking crack.

168
00:11:26,232 --> 00:11:27,926
They would cook crack.

169
00:11:28,902 --> 00:11:32,573
By the eighth grade, the SWAT
team was kicking in our door,

170
00:11:32,656 --> 00:11:34,992
busting my mother for selling drugs.

171
00:11:37,327 --> 00:11:41,403
It was a drug that overtook my mother.

172
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:46,262
Josh had a very similar
childhood to what I do.

173
00:11:48,757 --> 00:11:50,608
My very first memories of my father

174
00:11:50,633 --> 00:11:53,179
extinguishing a cigarette
on my mother's chest.

175
00:11:55,097 --> 00:11:59,477
Shortly after she left my
father, she started drinking.

176
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,274
It was my biggest fear that I was
going to get taken away from her.

177
00:12:04,816 --> 00:12:08,737
When she was sober, she
was a phenomenal mother.

178
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:12,115
I think she kind of felt trapped.

179
00:12:13,283 --> 00:12:15,786
My mom always complained about money.

180
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,447
She didn't have any money.

181
00:12:20,124 --> 00:12:22,715
I remember being poor growing up.

182
00:12:24,212 --> 00:12:28,382
And I remember thinking
when I graduate high school:

183
00:12:29,343 --> 00:12:33,483
"I want to start on a path that
is going to take me somewhere

184
00:12:33,508 --> 00:12:36,308
other than a struggle. "

185
00:12:38,101 --> 00:12:40,896
Half a mile, turn left
on to San Pedro Drive.

186
00:12:41,271 --> 00:12:45,621
We're currenlty on our way
to NPR for a radio interview.

187
00:12:45,777 --> 00:12:47,965
Well, those are our peeps.
That's our demographics.

188
00:12:48,321 --> 00:12:49,155
Howdy?

189
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:50,832
You're looking for Rick Daniels.

190
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:51,803
I think so. Yes.

191
00:12:51,828 --> 00:12:54,001
- You are the Minimalists.
- Yes, we are indeed.

192
00:12:54,203 --> 00:12:55,047
How are you ?

193
00:12:55,072 --> 00:12:57,385
- I'm Scott.
- I'm Ryan. I'm a hugger, man.

194
00:12:57,414 --> 00:12:58,348
Nice to meet you, buddy.

195
00:12:58,383 --> 00:12:59,700
Thanks for having us.

196
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:00,835
Joshua.

197
00:13:02,503 --> 00:13:05,864
I think my light bulb moment
when I was showing my guys

198
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:08,473
how to sell cell phones
to a five year old.

199
00:13:08,677 --> 00:13:10,220
I was like, "What am I doing?"

200
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:14,800
This mentality of getting
a better promotion,

201
00:13:14,825 --> 00:13:17,318
Getting a better house,
getting a better car,

202
00:13:17,352 --> 00:13:21,816
getting a bigger paycheck, being
able to buy more expensive bar tabs.

203
00:13:22,191 --> 00:13:25,593
And, you know, to do that I had to
sell cell phones to five-year-olds.

204
00:13:26,112 --> 00:13:27,530
There's a template out there.

205
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:29,282
You can call it the American Dream,

206
00:13:29,365 --> 00:13:31,493
or keeping up with the
Joneses, or whatever.

207
00:13:31,994 --> 00:13:34,412
That's just a template.
It's not the template.

208
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:36,744
And once we realize that,

209
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:41,128
I think we can create our own
template that works just for us.

210
00:13:46,634 --> 00:13:49,220
The American Dream has a long history

211
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:54,746
which started out as a concept that
was really more about opportunity.

212
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,832
The US is a land of opportunity

213
00:13:59,857 --> 00:14:03,903
where somebody could start out at
the bottom, work hard and do well.

214
00:14:05,195 --> 00:14:09,885
There is no question that
what it means to have made it,

215
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,954
or have achieved the American
Dream in the United States

216
00:14:13,038 --> 00:14:16,666
has increased tremendously
in material terms.

217
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:20,003
A hundred thousand dollar
a year plus kind of income

218
00:14:20,086 --> 00:14:23,232
became more and more
an aspirational norm

219
00:14:23,257 --> 00:14:26,152
across the society, because
that's what's portrayed

220
00:14:26,177 --> 00:14:27,678
as normal on TV.

221
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,432
A six-figure income.

222
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:37,689
Beginning from about the mid 1990s,

223
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:41,418
Americans went on a buying
spree that was probably

224
00:14:41,443 --> 00:14:43,445
unprecedented in human history.

225
00:14:43,528 --> 00:14:48,326
Average household expenditures

226
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:51,579
And a lot of it had to do
with the cheapness of products

227
00:14:51,622 --> 00:14:53,957
coming mostly from China.

228
00:14:57,835 --> 00:15:02,370
Whether we're talking
about fashion, electronics,

229
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:05,219
all types of household goods.

230
00:15:10,224 --> 00:15:12,394
So stuff's cheaper, but
it's also more available.

231
00:15:12,465 --> 00:15:14,778
You can order stuff 24 hours online.
[Graham Hill, Founder, Lifeedited]

232
00:15:14,803 --> 00:15:16,756
And there are big box stores.
[Graham Hill, Founder, Lifeedited]

233
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:20,777
We end up accumulating
a lot more stuff.

234
00:15:22,144 --> 00:15:24,240
So much so that eventhough you have

235
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,874
about three times the space per person

236
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:29,367
that we used to have in the
50's, so a lot more space ...

237
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,124
We got so much stuff, we
need space on top of that,

238
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:37,796
and so there's a 2.2 billion square
foot personal storage industry.

239
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:40,590
Which is ludicrous.

240
00:15:43,135 --> 00:15:46,727
And so you have people living
in these... enormous homes.

241
00:15:47,423 --> 00:15:49,185
And if you really look at it,

242
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,769
people don't use the
space that they have.

243
00:15:52,228 --> 00:15:54,657
Someone did a study and it
showed a heat map of, like where,

244
00:15:54,682 --> 00:15:57,766
people travelled inside their homes ...
[David Friedlander, Comms Dir, Lifeedited]

245
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,298
over the course of a normal day with

246
00:15:59,323 --> 00:16:01,947
a family of four. And they
rent a very average home.

247
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:05,467
And what they found is that
people used about, maybe,

248
00:16:05,492 --> 00:16:08,245
maybe forty percent of their space.

249
00:16:08,662 --> 00:16:10,347
Nobody used the dining room.

250
00:16:10,414 --> 00:16:11,790
No one used the living room.

251
00:16:11,874 --> 00:16:13,667
There was a big, you know, porch.

252
00:16:13,752 --> 00:16:14,923
No one used the porch.

253
00:16:14,948 --> 00:16:17,439
You know, I mean, I'm not saying
this is the way everyone lives.

254
00:16:17,464 --> 00:16:20,422
Some people use dining rooms,
but it creates this big vacuum

255
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:23,560
that you have to fill, so people a
throwing all this crap into their homes,

256
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:24,796
that they don't need.

257
00:16:29,352 --> 00:16:30,728
We're living our lives

258
00:16:30,811 --> 00:16:32,104
depending on the space we've got

259
00:16:32,188 --> 00:16:34,997
rather than creating our
space to fit our lives.

260
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:40,739
It's so easy to go
wrong, and you wind up

261
00:16:40,822 --> 00:16:43,840
with three dining tables in the same house.
[Frank Mascia, Architect]

262
00:16:43,992 --> 00:16:47,829
Well, you have to run pretty fast to
eat at three tables at the same meal.

263
00:16:48,622 --> 00:16:55,355
Nothing is more responsible than living
in the smallest space you possibly can.

264
00:16:59,092 --> 00:17:05,432
We've probably sold or donated, let's
say, at least 90 percent of our stuff.

265
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:10,425
I mean, you can't bring all
your stuff into a tiny house.

266
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:15,250
I was commuting about two hours a day...
[Tammy Strobel, Author]

267
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:19,739
and then sitting in a cubicle,
for ten to twelve hours a day.

268
00:17:19,823 --> 00:17:22,559
I had gained a lot of weight.
I was unhappy.

269
00:17:22,826 --> 00:17:25,964
And I was, kind of like,
"What's wrong with me?"

270
00:17:25,989 --> 00:17:28,248
I should be happy.
I've got all these stuff.

271
00:17:28,456 --> 00:17:30,775
A nice home, a great husband.

272
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:33,645
And Logan was like,

273
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:36,342
"Well, you know, you could
probably quit your job

274
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:40,539
if we simplified and moved
into a smaller apartment."

275
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:43,054
And I was like, "What the
hell are you talking about?"

276
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:44,850
"I don't want to get rid of my stuff."

277
00:17:45,517 --> 00:17:48,787
I found a YouTube video,
saw the tiny houses,

278
00:17:48,812 --> 00:17:50,333
and I was hooked.

279
00:17:54,652 --> 00:17:55,778
Hi, Earl.

280
00:17:56,571 --> 00:17:57,780
What's up, dude?

281
00:18:00,783 --> 00:18:03,594
I think the biggest thing for
me, at least in the beginning,

282
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:06,170
was the financial side of things.

283
00:18:06,874 --> 00:18:09,668
When we looked at our
budget and the numbers,

284
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,957
I was like, well,
let's just give it a go.

285
00:18:13,464 --> 00:18:17,001
If I hate a smaller apartment,
we can always upsize."

286
00:18:19,554 --> 00:18:22,682
I think there is this
element of affordability,

287
00:18:22,724 --> 00:18:25,977
simplicity and sustainability
that just makes

288
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,563
tiny houses seem like
the perfect solution

289
00:18:28,646 --> 00:18:31,192
to a problem that we
haven't yet figured out,

290
00:18:31,817 --> 00:18:34,601
which is: how do we go from working...
[Jay Austin, Tiny-House Designer]

291
00:18:34,626 --> 00:18:35,934
all throughout our lifetime
[Jay Austin, Tiny-House Designer]

292
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:38,991
to enjoying a lifetime with a
bit of work here and there?

293
00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:43,979
For a long time when
people were looking

294
00:18:44,004 --> 00:18:46,583
to buy their first house, they
looked at their budget

295
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,044
and they said: "How much
money do I have to spend?"

296
00:18:49,252 --> 00:18:51,153
"Oh I have $ 500,000

297
00:18:51,177 --> 00:18:54,277
Let me buy whatever $
500,000 can get me."

298
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:58,321
And the big mistake there
was that these individuals

299
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,389
didn't have $ 500,000.

300
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:04,499
They had a loan that would
guarantee them that amount.

301
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,810
And, of course, after a few
years of people buying houses

302
00:19:08,835 --> 00:19:10,734
that they weren't actually buying,

303
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,753
they were just hoping
to buy it someday,

304
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,697
the entire housing market collapsed.

305
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:18,713
We're down 1.7 percent here,
a loss of 37 points or so.

306
00:19:18,738 --> 00:19:20,661
Apple shares are just getting
hammered this morning.

307
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:23,206
We're down by between three
and four and a half percent

308
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:24,707
generally across these markets.

309
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,085
Let's talk about the speed

310
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,100
with which we are watching
this market deteriorate.

311
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:32,882
It was the worse day on Wall
Street's since the crash of 1987.

312
00:19:32,966 --> 00:19:36,382
This could be the most
serious recession in decades.

313
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:39,637
And that means life, as most
Americans know it, is about to change.

314
00:19:39,662 --> 00:19:41,642
In some cases, dramatically.

315
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:44,303
I think where that has left us,

316
00:19:44,353 --> 00:19:50,502
in the wake of a recession,
is with a really, really

317
00:19:50,527 --> 00:19:54,441
strong appeal to buy a house outright.

318
00:19:57,701 --> 00:19:59,887
The vision that really
came out of LifeEdited

319
00:19:59,912 --> 00:20:03,534
is just like, "Hey, I think we
got to take a step back here."

320
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:07,503
We are very much a
mission based company.

321
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:11,341
The mission being to do more with less.

322
00:20:12,843 --> 00:20:15,237
So the LifeEdited prototype apartment

323
00:20:15,262 --> 00:20:20,058
started with me buying a place
420 square feet in New York

324
00:20:20,726 --> 00:20:24,619
And coming up with a
really aggressive program.

325
00:20:24,644 --> 00:20:26,566
What I was asking for was a lot.

326
00:20:29,986 --> 00:20:32,634
Living home for a couple.

327
00:20:32,658 --> 00:20:35,628
Be able to have a sit
down dinner for 10 or 12.

328
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:38,203
To be able to have guests
over in a civil manner.

329
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:43,083
And be able to work at home
with some sort of standing desk.

330
00:20:44,752 --> 00:20:50,300
Very quickly, I realized that
small place made so much sense

331
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:53,762
environmentally, but also made
sense from many other levels.

332
00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:58,910
One of the things that we really
want to do is design homes

333
00:20:58,935 --> 00:21:03,436
around A, how people live,
and B, what's truly important.

334
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:05,583
Creating more social homes,
you know, homes that actually

335
00:21:05,608 --> 00:21:07,410
bring people closer together.

336
00:21:08,611 --> 00:21:10,821
It was kind of an
incredible experience,

337
00:21:10,905 --> 00:21:13,825
could going from a
1200 square foot space,

338
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:16,954
I had  never felt more calm in my life.
[Jacqueline Schmidt, Illustrator, Designer]

339
00:21:17,252 --> 00:21:18,947
There is less stuff to think about.

340
00:21:18,972 --> 00:21:20,931
Our overhead was lower.

341
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,418
This is when I first started to say:

342
00:21:23,502 --> 00:21:26,756
"You know, this LifeEdited
thing,this philosophy,

343
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,592
maybe there's something to it. "

344
00:21:30,885 --> 00:21:33,096
A beautiful future for us

345
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,142
would be to do development
that does really well financially,

346
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:39,561
has a much lower footprint,

347
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,981
and have lots of developers
copy what we're doing.

348
00:21:43,315 --> 00:21:48,278
And so that it really spreads and we
start to change how we live as Americans

349
00:21:48,362 --> 00:21:52,462
and just change this desire for
bigger is better philosophy.

350
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,745
I think we've only begun to re-examine what it

351
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,790
means to be successful in life.

352
00:21:58,873 --> 00:22:00,875
That's it no longer that white fence,

353
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,397
it's no longer that McMansion.

354
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:04,547
I think that people are beginning

355
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,590
to recognise that they've
maybe been tricked,

356
00:22:07,675 --> 00:22:11,971
and that they maybe have
more agency over their options

357
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:13,667
than they once thought they did.

358
00:22:21,064 --> 00:22:23,400
We're out sharing a recipe.

359
00:22:23,483 --> 00:22:25,527
You know, we're not out
here trying to proselytize.

360
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,274
We're not trying to convert
anyone to minimalism.

361
00:22:28,531 --> 00:22:30,408
But I do want to share a recipe and see

362
00:22:30,491 --> 00:22:34,203
if there are ingredients that
other people get value from,

363
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:38,040
and apply those ingredients
to their own lives.

364
00:22:39,917 --> 00:22:41,920
There is this underlying discontent,

365
00:22:42,004 --> 00:22:45,424
and I think that it starts
to manifest in our stuff.

366
00:22:45,507 --> 00:22:47,593
And what I'm finding as
we go out on the road,

367
00:22:47,676 --> 00:22:49,636
and when we talked to so many people.

368
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:54,100
Everyone is looking for
more meaning in their lives.

369
00:22:58,438 --> 00:23:00,106
We're at the Tucson Book Festival.

370
00:23:00,273 --> 00:23:02,338
We're getting ready to
go, sign some books ...

371
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:05,806
and then, a little bit
later, we'll do our speech.

372
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,077
Man, look at all these people waiting
to get their books signed by us.

373
00:23:14,288 --> 00:23:15,831
Let's sit on the outside.

374
00:23:16,749 --> 00:23:18,543
This just doesn't feel like us.

375
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,389
If one person comes,

376
00:23:20,962 --> 00:23:23,465
then we will go out to
the front and stand there.

377
00:23:25,217 --> 00:23:26,384
Okay.

378
00:23:27,177 --> 00:23:28,668
- What's up man?
- I love your stuff.

379
00:23:28,693 --> 00:23:30,723
Oh thanks. I'm a hugger, brother.
I'm going to give you a hug.

380
00:23:30,772 --> 00:23:34,769
Yeah, I follow you guys on Facebook
and you got your talk this afternoon.

381
00:23:34,894 --> 00:23:36,172
What time is it at?

382
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,105
We're at 7:00 o'clock.

383
00:23:38,189 --> 00:23:39,232
GALLAGHER THEATER

384
00:23:40,358 --> 00:23:42,435
Imagine a life with less.

385
00:23:43,237 --> 00:23:47,847
Less stuff, less clutter, less stress,

386
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:50,869
and debt and discontent.

387
00:23:50,953 --> 00:23:53,080
A life with fewer distractions.

388
00:23:53,997 --> 00:23:55,637
Now imagine a life with more.

389
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:58,962
More time, more
meaningful relationships,

390
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:03,091
more growth, and
contribution and contentment.

391
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,844
So it's funny because people
will inevitably come on to us

392
00:24:06,928 --> 00:24:09,682
and will be llike: "No, I'm
not a minimalist like you."

393
00:24:09,765 --> 00:24:12,768
I've got this book
collection and I love books.

394
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:16,939
And I've got nice big library and
I love the way the book smell.

395
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,239
I love turning the pages.
I love how they feel.

396
00:24:19,264 --> 00:24:21,110
I love lending them out to my friends.

397
00:24:21,135 --> 00:24:23,387
And then we talk about the book later.

398
00:24:23,412 --> 00:24:26,145
And I'm like, "Hey, keep your books."

399
00:24:26,742 --> 00:24:29,202
"Sounds like you get a lot of value out of your books."

400
00:24:29,536 --> 00:24:31,913
And that's what I would say
with any type of collection.

401
00:24:32,957 --> 00:24:34,750
If you get a book or
whatever, that's great.

402
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:36,466
Make sure you  minimize it afterwards.

403
00:24:37,987 --> 00:24:40,548
But I'd love to get a hug
from you as well, you know.

404
00:24:40,631 --> 00:24:44,066
We're big time huggers.
They're free and transferable.

405
00:24:44,093 --> 00:24:46,032
Make sure you got
one from us afterwards.

406
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:01,404
I was 27 years old.

407
00:25:02,238 --> 00:25:06,367
I was a director of operations
for 150 retail stores.

408
00:25:06,826 --> 00:25:09,329
It was December 23, 2008,

409
00:25:10,741 --> 00:25:13,866
I got a phone call from my mom.

410
00:25:15,377 --> 00:25:17,421
I sent it to voicemail
because I was at a meeting.

411
00:25:18,547 --> 00:25:22,217
At 7:00 pm, going through
this barrage of e-mails,

412
00:25:23,136 --> 00:25:27,140
and I realize I've had
several voicemails.

413
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,937
One was from my mom and...
she had been sober for a while,

414
00:25:33,188 --> 00:25:35,483
but I could tell in the
message she had been drinking.

415
00:25:38,486 --> 00:25:39,904
On her voicemail,

416
00:25:40,404 --> 00:25:43,962
She said, "Honey, it's me."

417
00:25:44,867 --> 00:25:46,341
Can you call me back?

418
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:53,460
She told me the doctors
have found something.

419
00:25:57,964 --> 00:26:01,427
And she found out she had
stage four lung cancer.

420
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:05,764
She went through
chemo and radiation,

421
00:26:05,995 --> 00:26:09,143
but in stage four, you
usually don't get out of that.

422
00:26:10,144 --> 00:26:13,023
I got to the hospital.
My mom was still on the bed.

423
00:26:14,983 --> 00:26:17,600
It was the first time I
cried in my adult life.

424
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:21,240
Sobbed uncontrollably.

425
00:26:21,642 --> 00:26:23,367
I kept saying I was sorry.

426
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,579
I did not even know why
at the time I was saying it.

427
00:26:26,663 --> 00:26:29,249
It was just, I suppose, the
only thing that I could say.

428
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:33,799
I really wished that I would
have spent more time with her.

429
00:26:43,305 --> 00:26:46,726
My mother's death still
hangs in the air around me.

430
00:26:47,466 --> 00:26:52,451
And now, during the same month,
my six-year marriage in ending.

431
00:26:55,026 --> 00:26:57,070
But even while Rome is burning,

432
00:26:57,154 --> 00:27:01,032
there somehow time
for shopping at IKEA.

433
00:27:02,075 --> 00:27:04,936
See? When I moved out of
the house earlier in the week,

434
00:27:04,961 --> 00:27:08,958
toting my many personal
belongings in large bins and boxes

435
00:27:08,983 --> 00:27:12,628
and 50 gallons garbage
bags, my first inclination

436
00:27:12,624 --> 00:27:17,009
was, of course, to
purchase the things I still

437
00:27:17,718 --> 00:27:19,811
needed for my new place.

438
00:27:20,512 --> 00:27:22,985
You know, just the basics.

439
00:27:23,682 --> 00:27:27,227
A shower curtain, towels, a bed, and,

440
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:29,981
I need a couch and a
matching leather chair,

441
00:27:30,064 --> 00:27:35,584
and a loveseat, and a lamp,
and a desk, and a desk chair,

442
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:37,238
and another lamp for over there.

443
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,767
And yeah, don't forget
about the sideboard

444
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:42,995
that matches the desk and
a dresser for the bedroom.

445
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:46,499
And I need a coffee table
and a couple of end tables,

446
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:49,794
and a TV stand for
the TV I still need to buy.

447
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:52,240
And now that I think about it,

448
00:27:52,265 --> 00:27:56,852
I'm going to want my apartment
to be my style, you know,

449
00:27:57,219 --> 00:27:58,470
my own motif.

450
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:02,098
So I need certain decoratives
to spruce up the decor.

451
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:05,663
But wait, what exactly is my style?

452
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,980
And do these stainless steel frames

453
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,063
embody that particular style?

454
00:28:10,483 --> 00:28:13,788
Does this replica Matisse
sketch accurately capture

455
00:28:13,813 --> 00:28:16,531
my edgy but professional vibe?

456
00:28:17,374 --> 00:28:19,034
Exactly how edgy am I?

457
00:28:20,744 --> 00:28:23,914
What espresso maker
defines me as a man?

458
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:27,256
But the fact that I'm asking
these questions preclude me

459
00:28:27,281 --> 00:28:31,548
from being a "man's man"?

460
00:28:32,766 --> 00:28:35,677
How many plates, and cups,
and bowls should a man own?

461
00:28:36,095 --> 00:28:38,471
I guess I need a dining
room table too, right?

462
00:28:38,555 --> 00:28:41,509
And a rug for the entryway, and bath mat

463
00:28:41,534 --> 00:28:44,040
and what about that
one thing, that thing

464
00:28:44,065 --> 00:28:46,564
that sort of like a rug, but longer?

465
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:48,732
Yeah, a runner.

466
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:51,182
I'm gonna need one of those.

467
00:28:52,153 --> 00:28:54,526
And I'm also going to need ...

468
00:28:55,721 --> 00:28:57,937
Oh hell, what else do I need?

469
00:29:09,422 --> 00:29:12,300
My name is Sam Harris.
I am an author and a neuroscientist.

470
00:29:12,404 --> 00:29:16,137
And I'm interested in how
our growing understanding

471
00:29:16,162 --> 00:29:20,338
of ourselves scientifically,
can and must and really

472
00:29:20,363 --> 00:29:22,868
should change our conception

473
00:29:22,893 --> 00:29:25,167
of what it means to live a good life.

474
00:29:26,273 --> 00:29:31,445
Gratifying desires in a
starkly materialistic way

475
00:29:31,653 --> 00:29:34,032
is really an interesting phenomenon.

476
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:38,286
You have this thing that
you were obsessed about.

477
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:41,998
But then the new version comes out,

478
00:29:42,023 --> 00:29:45,106
which is new and
improved in a dozen ways.

479
00:29:45,711 --> 00:29:49,356
When it comes to the newest, hottest,
most crave worthy status symbols,

480
00:29:49,381 --> 00:29:53,041
you can bet customers will
wait long hours to snag one.

481
00:29:57,139 --> 00:29:59,559
And now you no longer care
about the one you have.

482
00:29:59,584 --> 00:30:02,598
In fact, the one you have is
a source of dissatisfaction.

483
00:30:04,356 --> 00:30:07,734
I think we are confused about
what's gonna make us happy.

484
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:11,821
Many people think that
material possessions are really

485
00:30:11,846 --> 00:30:13,307
the center of the bullseye,

486
00:30:13,332 --> 00:30:17,078
and they expect that you
gratifying each desire as it arises

487
00:30:17,161 --> 00:30:20,606
will somehow summate
into a satisfying life.

488
00:30:23,752 --> 00:30:24,836
School of Social Work

489
00:30:24,861 --> 00:30:28,279
It is clear that, as human beings ...
Gail Steketee, Compulsive-Hoarding Expert

490
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:31,769
... we have strong attachment, initially
Gail Steketee, Compulsive-Hoarding Expert

491
00:30:31,794 --> 00:30:34,596
in our lives to people
who are caring for us.

492
00:30:35,515 --> 00:30:39,105
And sometimes it feels like
those attachment spill over

493
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:43,619
to objects, as if they were
as important as people.

494
00:30:44,774 --> 00:30:48,730
I'm not so sure that we have such
a great relationship with things.

495
00:30:57,037 --> 00:30:58,872
Give me... Give me that box!

496
00:30:59,623 --> 00:31:01,042
Get off of me!

497
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:02,769
Why are you being so aggressive?

498
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,254
You're scaring me!

499
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:12,430
I was talking to author and
sociologist Juliet Schor.

500
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:15,253
And I said: The problem with our society...
[Colin Beavan, Author, No Impact Man]

501
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:17,146
is that we're too materialistic.
[Colin Beavan, Author, No Impact Man]

502
00:31:18,853 --> 00:31:21,624
And she said actually if you
think about it in some ways,

503
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,476
we're not material enough.

504
00:31:26,006 --> 00:31:29,740
We are too materialistic in
the everyday sense of the word.

505
00:31:29,966 --> 00:31:32,924
And we are not all materialistic enough

506
00:31:32,955 --> 00:31:34,619
in the true sense of the word.

507
00:31:34,911 --> 00:31:36,515
We need to be true materialists,

508
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,586
like we really care about
the materiality of goods.

509
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:44,005
Instead, we are in a world
in which material goods are

510
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,799
so important for their
symbolic meanings,

511
00:31:47,175 --> 00:31:50,406
What they do to position
us in the status system,

512
00:31:50,431 --> 00:31:53,834
based on what advertising or
marketing says they're about.

513
00:31:59,813 --> 00:32:05,695
The status quo in the fashion industry
right now is... driven by fast fashion.

514
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,531
Maybe when our moms
were shopping for clothes

515
00:32:08,556 --> 00:32:11,326
or our grandmothers, there
were four seasons a year.

516
00:32:11,701 --> 00:32:12,983
Or maybe even two seasons.

517
00:32:13,008 --> 00:32:15,150
You're dressed for cold or
you're dressed for warmth.

518
00:32:15,175 --> 00:32:19,168
Now we work in a cycle
of 52 seasons per year.

519
00:32:28,053 --> 00:32:30,639
They want you to feel
like you're out of trend

520
00:32:30,722 --> 00:32:34,454
after one week so that you'll buy
something new the following week.

521
00:32:36,061 --> 00:32:37,687
There have actually been accounts

522
00:32:37,771 --> 00:32:41,734
of big fashion retailers
baling all of the clothes

523
00:32:41,818 --> 00:32:44,911
from one week together,
slashing through them with scissors,

524
00:32:44,936 --> 00:32:47,365
destroying them, and leaving
them on the side of the roads

525
00:32:47,448 --> 00:32:50,743
so that nobody can resell
them or even wear them.

526
00:32:51,911 --> 00:32:57,046
They want consumers to buy as
much clothing as quickly as possible.

527
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:01,193
The era of fast fashion,

528
00:33:01,218 --> 00:33:03,507
in which we are making
clothes in sweatshops

529
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,276
so we're not paying the true labor cost

530
00:33:05,301 --> 00:33:07,294
and we're not paying
the ecological cost

531
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,339
of these things, drove
the price of apparel down

532
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:14,089
so far that used apparel
became worthless.

533
00:33:14,978 --> 00:33:18,213
I'd like to think rice and beans
cost more than used apparel.

534
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:24,011
In historical terms, that's
the world upside down.

535
00:33:24,488 --> 00:33:27,116
And that represents the economics

536
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:31,920
of such an extreme and
profound unsustainability.

537
00:33:33,206 --> 00:33:37,257
For a scholar of these things, it's
kind of breathtaking and horrifying.

538
00:33:39,463 --> 00:33:41,735
Fast fashion is what's
happened to apparel

539
00:33:41,783 --> 00:33:44,552
and then increasingly to the
home consumer goods sector.

540
00:33:45,303 --> 00:33:47,346
Almost everything in the home now

541
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:50,349
would become an
object of fashionability,

542
00:33:50,374 --> 00:33:54,437
and that's been a
dramatic transformation.

543
00:33:55,397 --> 00:33:58,275
If you think about the
concept of fashion,

544
00:33:58,358 --> 00:34:01,695
it embodies in it the idea that you can

545
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,115
throw things away not when
they're no longer usable,

546
00:34:05,199 --> 00:34:07,035
but when they no longer
have that social value

547
00:34:07,118 --> 00:34:09,373
or they're no longer fashionable.

548
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:14,682
I think people buy because they are ...
[Leo Babauta, Author, Zen Habits]

549
00:34:14,707 --> 00:34:17,545
trying to fulfill this
void inside of them.

550
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,716
I know that because that was me.

551
00:34:20,382 --> 00:34:22,426
But no matter how much stuff we buy,

552
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,345
and how many
different fads that we try,

553
00:34:24,428 --> 00:34:26,597
we don't become a more whole person.

554
00:34:26,622 --> 00:34:27,608
We keep looking.

555
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:29,558
This hunger never gets fulfilled.

556
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,770
I think it goes to the bottom one fact

557
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:37,067
that you can never get enough
of what you don't really want.

558
00:34:37,526 --> 00:34:39,653
In other words, deep
down, we don't really

559
00:34:39,736 --> 00:34:42,948
want more goodies,
more toys, more cars.

560
00:34:43,031 --> 00:34:45,757
We want what they will bring us.

561
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,703
We want to feel whole.

562
00:34:47,787 --> 00:34:49,789
We want to feel content.

563
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:55,962
This mindless consumption,
this same thing

564
00:34:56,087 --> 00:34:58,674
that's not making us
happy, is also causing

565
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,927
the degradation of our habitat.

566
00:35:01,426 --> 00:35:05,584
We can afford to have 350 parts
per million of carbon dioxide

567
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:07,140
in the atmosphere.

568
00:35:07,169 --> 00:35:10,107
We're closing in on
400 parts per million.

569
00:35:10,353 --> 00:35:13,731
This is caused by the burning
of oil, of natural gas, of coal.

570
00:35:13,856 --> 00:35:17,610
Of all the fuels that we use
to power our consumer economy,

571
00:35:17,694 --> 00:35:20,508
to power the making of
craft that we don't need.

572
00:35:20,947 --> 00:35:25,327
This is real, and we really
have to do something about it.

573
00:35:26,203 --> 00:35:27,913
We are not knowing to ever be

574
00:35:27,997 --> 00:35:31,214
able to achieve the environmental gains

575
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:35,463
that we're seeking, while still
expecting our lives to be the same.

576
00:35:35,488 --> 00:35:37,216
We don't have to give up a lot.

577
00:35:37,241 --> 00:35:38,841
BLACK FRIDAY FRENZY

578
00:35:43,414 --> 00:35:46,500
The secret is that a lot of that
we're not actually going to miss.

579
00:35:55,633 --> 00:35:58,571
It has been like four plus years

580
00:35:58,629 --> 00:36:00,115
that I've been
technically been homeless,

581
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:03,118
so I go to new countries
and rent flats.

582
00:36:03,201 --> 00:36:05,912
So it's maybe in between homes

583
00:36:05,996 --> 00:36:07,477
or maybe home full.

584
00:36:07,502 --> 00:36:10,834
I just have a lot of homes,
just not in one place,

585
00:36:10,917 --> 00:36:13,171
not for very long.
It's always interesting.

586
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,340
You go on a date or something
and have to explain:

587
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,924
"Oh yes, I'm homeless."

588
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,653
Maybe I shouldn't leave with that.

589
00:36:24,419 --> 00:36:26,967
When I first started reducing
the number of things in my life,

590
00:36:26,992 --> 00:36:29,021
and started getting rid
of essentially everything

591
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,449
that did not fit in these bags,

592
00:36:30,473 --> 00:36:32,095
so I went and took photos of everything...
[Colin Wright, Entrepreneur, Taveler]

593
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,080
that I owned in the world and counted.
[Colin Wright, Entrepreneur, Taveler]

594
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:39,605
And as a result, I found out that I
had 51 things in the entire world.

595
00:36:41,879 --> 00:36:44,537
I started living this
way about four years ago.

596
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:46,687
I was running a branding studio.

597
00:36:46,873 --> 00:36:49,502
I had always wanted
to travel the world,

598
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:52,129
and I had never left the country.

599
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:55,424
And that was kind of a sign
of my failure in a lot of ways.

600
00:36:56,272 --> 00:37:00,367
So I started a blog, left my
career behind in Los Angeles,

601
00:37:00,398 --> 00:37:02,373
and started looking for something new,

602
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:05,782
Something a little bit different, and
something a little bit more in line

603
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,649
with what I wanted out of life.

604
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:11,005
And now I carry everything
that I own on my back,

605
00:37:11,074 --> 00:37:13,423
much like a hermit crab or a turtle.

606
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:16,932
I was able to get rid of everything

607
00:37:16,964 --> 00:37:20,537
that I owned, that didn't
fit into a carry-on luggage,

608
00:37:20,562 --> 00:37:23,318
which was an immense
decision and not something

609
00:37:23,343 --> 00:37:25,373
that I expected from the get-go.

610
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:28,624
I realized very quickly
I wouldn't need as much.

611
00:37:28,692 --> 00:37:33,090
And it came to the conclusion
that anything I left behind

612
00:37:33,115 --> 00:37:35,495
would probably be left behind forever.

613
00:37:40,028 --> 00:37:44,741
What did it at the end of the day,
knowing this path had been well tread,

614
00:37:44,766 --> 00:37:48,732
the direction I was going, and these
very very successful men and women

615
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:50,984
with all of this money
and all this prestige,

616
00:37:51,067 --> 00:37:54,071
and all this professional
background behind them,

617
00:37:54,461 --> 00:37:55,990
they weren't happy.

618
00:37:56,695 --> 00:37:59,958
They're very successful,
but not in an absolute sense.

619
00:38:00,035 --> 00:38:02,663
They're dollars and cents successful.

620
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:05,375
It seemed far much more likely
that I could find something,

621
00:38:05,413 --> 00:38:08,253
find a definition of success
that would actually get me

622
00:38:08,278 --> 00:38:12,257
to a place where I was both
successful and just incredibly happy.

623
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:18,890
It does look like money can
buy happiness in some sense.

624
00:38:20,183 --> 00:38:25,313
In global research,
below US$70,000 a year,

625
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:28,180
adding greater material well-being

626
00:38:28,255 --> 00:38:31,635
is linked to greater
psychological well-being.

627
00:38:32,488 --> 00:38:35,491
But when you start pushing
past that rough threshold,

628
00:38:35,582 --> 00:38:37,555
money doesn't buy happiness.

629
00:38:38,078 --> 00:38:40,750
You can have more money,
but you're not happier.

630
00:38:41,163 --> 00:38:43,043
Jim Carrey has a quote where he says:

631
00:38:43,082 --> 00:38:45,376
"I wish everyone can
become rich and famous,

632
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,545
so they could realize
it's not the answer."

633
00:38:48,207 --> 00:38:50,856
The first response is always this.

634
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,006
"Well, it's easy for Jim Carrey to say,

635
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,174
he's rich and famous, right?"
Joshua Becker, Author, Clutterfree With Kids

636
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,160
And I'm like, "Wait a minute...
Joshua Becker, Author, Clutterfree With Kids

637
00:38:57,184 --> 00:38:59,368
who else could say that?"

638
00:38:59,558 --> 00:39:03,120
It would take someone rich
and famous to be able to say:

639
00:39:03,145 --> 00:39:05,144
"It's not worth it."

640
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:09,496
We all need to have
our basic needs met.

641
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:12,556
Having a house, food on the table...
[Tammy Strobel, Author]

642
00:39:12,581 --> 00:39:14,255
you know, being safe.
[Tammy Strobel, Author]

643
00:39:14,491 --> 00:39:16,618
That's really important to recognize,

644
00:39:16,643 --> 00:39:18,745
cos not everyone has these things.

645
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:22,306
You think that more money...
[Patrick Rhone, Author, Enough]

646
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:25,112
is going to, say, give you more security.
[Patrick Rhone, Author, Enough]

647
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,730
The problem is, is that
you don't necessarily

648
00:39:27,755 --> 00:39:30,494
have control over making more.

649
00:39:30,605 --> 00:39:34,012
One thing you do have
control over is spending less.

650
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:37,558
What you do have
control over is having less.

651
00:39:37,724 --> 00:39:40,561
And that by having
less, you automatically

652
00:39:40,735 --> 00:39:42,969
stretch what you do have.

653
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:47,669
It's not so much about
a financial gain for me...

654
00:39:47,694 --> 00:39:50,709
as it is about financial
freedom, which is the ability

655
00:39:50,734 --> 00:39:54,659
to wake up in the morning and
spends one's day as they see fit.

656
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,967
One part of why we...

657
00:39:57,991 --> 00:40:00,768
why we consume one thing
is that we work so long,

658
00:40:00,793 --> 00:40:04,628
and a lot of people aren't
finding fulfillment in their jobs.

659
00:40:05,044 --> 00:40:09,301
And they need someway to tell
themselves that it is worth it,

660
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:14,014
that it is amounting to something more
than a few numbers in a bank account.

661
00:40:14,806 --> 00:40:18,560
There is more. There is more to
life than bills and money and work.

662
00:40:22,593 --> 00:40:23,816
How do you win?

663
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:25,890
You win by the...

664
00:40:25,955 --> 00:40:27,868
traditional monikers of success.
[AJ Leon, Former Wall Street Broker]

665
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:29,005
You win by how many zeros
[AJ Leon, Former Wall Street Broker]

666
00:40:29,114 --> 00:40:30,657
right at the end of your paycheck.
[AJ Leon, Former Wall Street Broker]

667
00:40:30,849 --> 00:40:33,599
I remember I was sitting
in a Barnes and Noble's,

668
00:40:33,624 --> 00:40:35,411
and I was deciding what
major I would study,

669
00:40:35,436 --> 00:40:37,748
and all I was doing was
leafing through this book.

670
00:40:37,831 --> 00:40:41,376
It was a book that showed degree
versus and earning potential over time.

671
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,066
And that's when I zeroed in
on finance and accounting.

672
00:40:44,963 --> 00:40:48,706
My entire life became about
winning, with a capital "W".

673
00:40:48,731 --> 00:40:53,212
My entire life became about being
the guy that would be respected.

674
00:40:53,892 --> 00:40:55,971
I've had a series of vertical
leaps through my 20s,

675
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:58,061
which landed me to this place in 2008.

676
00:40:58,144 --> 00:41:00,522
I was making a ridiculous
six figure salary.

677
00:41:00,547 --> 00:41:01,827
I've got a corner office.

678
00:41:02,161 --> 00:41:07,166
And on December 31, 2007, my
boss calls me into his office,

679
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:09,886
and he tells me that
I'm getting a promotion.

680
00:41:10,323 --> 00:41:12,037
And this is it.
This is the game changer.

681
00:41:12,118 --> 00:41:13,995
This is me being a
junior partner in this firm

682
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:17,290
and everything that
I'd ever worked for

683
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:21,295
was gonna be handed to
me right then and there.

684
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,938
You know, in banking
terms, I was minted.

685
00:41:23,963 --> 00:41:27,517
And I remember just
hearing this man say that,

686
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:31,555
and it was just a really
bizarre kind of ethereal moment.

687
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:33,599
Where I was like watching
this happen, you know?

688
00:41:33,683 --> 00:41:36,137
I was almost ... and I
walked out of his office,

689
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:39,891
and I walked back into my own, and
I just closed the door behind me.

690
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:41,389
I just started weeping.

691
00:41:42,317 --> 00:41:46,571
Because I realized that I was
completely and utterly trapped.

692
00:41:46,596 --> 00:41:49,826
And that I would never
be able to walk away

693
00:41:49,851 --> 00:41:51,869
from that amount of
money ever in my life.

694
00:41:52,113 --> 00:41:56,290
And any dream that I had
of living a life of purpose

695
00:41:56,315 --> 00:42:00,211
and meaning, and...
being an adventurer,

696
00:42:00,294 --> 00:42:02,293
and somebody that
would actually take risks,

697
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:04,506
and live a life that's
deliberate and intentional.

698
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:05,696
Those were gone!

699
00:42:07,636 --> 00:42:10,305
When you see your life scripted out,

700
00:42:10,389 --> 00:42:14,310
and you recognizes that
this is not anything I want.

701
00:42:14,335 --> 00:42:15,562
Why am I doing this?

702
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:18,314
This guy that's handing me
this firm, I don't want to be him.

703
00:42:18,339 --> 00:42:19,757
I don't envy his life.

704
00:42:21,187 --> 00:42:23,692
Hell, maybe this was
never for me to begin with.

705
00:42:23,717 --> 00:42:25,836
And maybe, if I don't leave right now,

706
00:42:26,072 --> 00:42:29,243
I'm going to be that
dude for the rest of my life.

707
00:42:30,786 --> 00:42:34,749
And I just took the elevator
down 28 storeys and that was it.

708
00:42:34,893 --> 00:42:38,259
And ever since then, I decided
that this life was going to be mine

709
00:42:38,284 --> 00:42:42,049
And it was going to be
wildly, flamboyantly my life.

710
00:42:42,215 --> 00:42:43,175
You know?

711
00:42:45,194 --> 00:42:46,821
Ready?
Here it is.

712
00:42:46,905 --> 00:42:48,465
Nevada.

713
00:42:57,899 --> 00:43:00,063
We're back, Nevada!

714
00:43:02,403 --> 00:43:04,570
Yeah. That was good.

715
00:43:06,492 --> 00:43:07,826
WELCOME TO Fabulous LAS VEGAS, NEVADA

716
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:09,578
- All these people are waiting,
- That's why we're here.

717
00:43:09,603 --> 00:43:11,630
and I'm not sure where
they're supposed to be.

718
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,506
I'm thinking... You wanna
go take a look over here?

719
00:43:13,531 --> 00:43:14,833
Sure, we can do that.

720
00:43:15,273 --> 00:43:18,473
We're scrambling to find
seats for roughly 30 people.

721
00:43:18,931 --> 00:43:22,769
This is the most disorganized
night of the tour, so far.

722
00:43:22,884 --> 00:43:25,303
We're in Las Vegas. Go figure.

723
00:43:25,688 --> 00:43:30,267
And the space that we rented here, for
whatever reason there, aren't ready for us.

724
00:43:30,292 --> 00:43:32,619
Even though that we paid rented space.

725
00:43:33,285 --> 00:43:35,515
Thankfully, there are
some awesome people here

726
00:43:35,648 --> 00:43:36,941
who are really helping us.

727
00:43:38,025 --> 00:43:39,527
Somehow, we're gonna make this work.

728
00:43:39,652 --> 00:43:40,611
Yes.

729
00:43:42,001 --> 00:43:43,490
Thank you very much.

730
00:43:45,575 --> 00:43:50,080
You know it's funny. I used to think
rich was earning $ 50,000 a year.

731
00:43:51,216 --> 00:43:53,626
Then when I started climbing the
corporate ladder in my early twenties,

732
00:43:53,651 --> 00:43:55,995
I quickly began earning $ 50,000.

733
00:43:56,629 --> 00:43:59,148
But I didn't feel rich.
Something went wrong.

734
00:43:59,173 --> 00:44:00,758
I had to go back to the drawing board.

735
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,483
And I found out that, I
hadn't adjusted for inflation.

736
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,684
Okay, so we can
pontificate for only so long.

737
00:44:08,709 --> 00:44:10,795
We're really here for
you, as Ryan mentioned,

738
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,418
and so we would like
to do what we call

739
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,378
questions and attempted answers.
[Clyde Dinkins, Las Vegas Resident]

740
00:44:15,379 --> 00:44:16,365
[Clyde Dinkins, Las Vegas Resident]

741
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:18,977
You're dedicated, you're
creative, you're innovative.

742
00:44:19,002 --> 00:44:21,838
You have a sincere desire for mankind,

743
00:44:22,699 --> 00:44:27,495
the very people who the
wolves of Wall Street fear.

744
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:29,944
And to me, you're removing
yourselves from the war.

745
00:44:30,247 --> 00:44:33,715
If you're really talking about
minimalism, the ultimate minimalist

746
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:36,088
is a hermit, a recluse, or a monk.

747
00:44:36,113 --> 00:44:38,382
And to me, that's not
gonna change the world.

748
00:44:38,465 --> 00:44:42,094
You know what I'm saying?
You're the only threat to that system.

749
00:44:43,926 --> 00:44:46,057
You're right, there are
two sides to the spectrum.

750
00:44:46,278 --> 00:44:49,769
I think we know... we're idealist
somewhere in the middle of that, right?

751
00:44:49,831 --> 00:44:52,230
Because I don't think there is
anything wrong with consumption.

752
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,983
The problem is compulsory consumption.

753
00:44:55,008 --> 00:44:57,753
Buying stuff because that's
what you're supposed to do.

754
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,405
That's what
advertising tells you to do.

755
00:44:59,434 --> 00:45:02,533
Or that's what this... magic
template is for happiness,

756
00:45:02,558 --> 00:45:03,922
so then, when you get it, you realize

757
00:45:03,947 --> 00:45:06,746
that it doesn't make you as
happy as you thought it would.

758
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,625
Yes, it was a great
comment, thank you so much.

759
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:12,668
We're trying to destroy those
wolves of Wall Street. I'm serious.

760
00:45:12,693 --> 00:45:14,379
- Amen. Let me grab a hug.
- Yeah.

761
00:45:14,404 --> 00:45:15,547
Yeah. Thank you so much.

762
00:45:15,572 --> 00:45:18,950
I tell you, your personality
and your straightforwardness,

763
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:22,639
and answering all the
questions, that charisma bound,

764
00:45:22,722 --> 00:45:26,017
was connecting with people,
as you can see yourself.

765
00:45:35,152 --> 00:45:37,154
It's like 4:30 in the morning.

766
00:45:37,237 --> 00:45:38,238
Yes.

767
00:45:38,322 --> 00:45:41,700
And we... are gonna go be on TV.

768
00:45:47,457 --> 00:45:48,750
Good morning, 5:23 am.

769
00:45:48,775 --> 00:45:52,253
A lot of us look forward to buying
the latest gadget or smartphone.

770
00:45:52,288 --> 00:45:55,340
But this morning, I'm joined by two men

771
00:45:55,365 --> 00:45:57,926
who've taken what
they say is a simpler route

772
00:45:57,962 --> 00:46:01,175
and are living a life of minimalism.

773
00:46:01,218 --> 00:46:02,219
Hello.

774
00:46:02,244 --> 00:46:05,406
Hi, we're here for the
5 o'clock hour and 6 o'clock hour,

775
00:46:05,431 --> 00:46:07,141
Josh and Ryan with the Minimalists.

776
00:46:08,528 --> 00:46:12,588
I was living the American Dream
and realized it wasn't my dream.

777
00:46:12,693 --> 00:46:14,444
I looked around at all
the stuff in my life

778
00:46:14,469 --> 00:46:16,652
when my mother died
and my marriage ended,

779
00:46:16,677 --> 00:46:20,042
both in the same month and started
questioning what was actually important.

780
00:46:20,071 --> 00:46:22,403
What things were actually
adding value to my life?

781
00:46:22,428 --> 00:46:23,934
And I realized that many of the things

782
00:46:23,959 --> 00:46:27,485
that I had bought to make me happy,
they weren't actually doing their job.

783
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:30,169
Okay well, good luck to you.
Take it easy.

784
00:46:30,236 --> 00:46:32,390
Don't do too much. Don't
buy anything today, alright?

785
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:33,307
Amen.

786
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,215
Good luck with that.
We'll be back in just a bit.

787
00:46:37,011 --> 00:46:38,908
<i>Well that's the 5:30,
the lastest storm is...

788
00:46:48,273 --> 00:46:51,151
Minimalism is not a radical lifestyle.

789
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:56,677
Yeah, I absolutely believe in
quality over quantity. Right?

790
00:46:56,702 --> 00:46:59,868
So I'd much rather have
one nice sweatshirt

791
00:47:00,092 --> 00:47:05,166
than a closet full of ugly sweatshirts
that I don't enjoy wearing.

792
00:47:05,191 --> 00:47:06,464
I don't own a lot of clothes now,

793
00:47:06,489 --> 00:47:10,504
but all the clothes I do own,
are my favorite clothes.

794
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:15,802
So let's take a look at what I have
packed for ten months of traveling.

795
00:47:17,035 --> 00:47:21,127
I'm wearing my one pair of jeans.
Got a couple of denim shirts.

796
00:47:21,516 --> 00:47:27,106
I have a short sleeve button-up
Oxford, a few T-shirts,

797
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,733
A blow dryer.

798
00:47:28,938 --> 00:47:31,611
Every good minimalist has a blow dryer.

799
00:47:32,695 --> 00:47:36,657
And plenty of underwear. Now
here's a secret with underwear.

800
00:47:37,045 --> 00:47:41,052
You have to have one color
that's in the middle.

801
00:47:41,077 --> 00:47:44,500
This is how you separate
your dirty underwear

802
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:47,920
from your clean underwear...
with the red pair of underwear.

803
00:47:49,296 --> 00:47:50,464
Toiletry bag.

804
00:47:51,591 --> 00:47:53,760
Everyone needs a toiletry bag, obviously.

805
00:47:53,887 --> 00:47:58,488
And I also have a laptop with me,
but that's it, for ten months.

806
00:48:04,775 --> 00:48:08,526
We don't really have a plan,
which is pretty much our story.

807
00:48:12,083 --> 00:48:18,417
In 2010, when I was really digging
into this decluttering and simplifying,

808
00:48:18,442 --> 00:48:20,134
I thought about the one place...
[Courtney Carver, Founder, Project 333]

809
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:22,607
in my house that was the most cluttered
[Courtney Carver, Founder, Project 333]

810
00:48:22,631 --> 00:48:24,631
and that was my closet.

811
00:48:26,545 --> 00:48:31,926
And so I decided to create
a minimalist fashion challenge,

812
00:48:32,093 --> 00:48:35,179
to use less than what I had.

813
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,275
So in Project 333, the challenge for me

814
00:48:39,433 --> 00:48:42,887
was to wear 33 items for three months.

815
00:48:42,912 --> 00:48:49,962
And the 33 items included clothing,
jewelry, accessories, and shoes.

816
00:48:50,764 --> 00:48:53,241
And that's where I usually lose people.

817
00:48:54,742 --> 00:48:58,413
It was a great way for me
to really see what I needed,

818
00:48:58,521 --> 00:49:02,045
what I was using, and just if
it would make a difference.

819
00:49:02,921 --> 00:49:05,086
And so I was working in advertising.

820
00:49:05,118 --> 00:49:07,298
I had a lot of clients
I had to see everyday.

821
00:49:07,323 --> 00:49:08,999
I go to to sales meetings,

822
00:49:09,024 --> 00:49:12,595
and for that first three
months, nobody noticed.

823
00:49:13,069 --> 00:49:15,965
The story got picked up
by the Associated Press,

824
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:18,064
because so many people
were writing about it,

825
00:49:18,101 --> 00:49:19,849
and practicing it and trying it.

826
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:23,905
In this video, I'm gonna talk more
about how I plan my Project 333.

827
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:27,250
Project 333...

828
00:49:27,903 --> 00:49:29,779
And I thought, "Oh boy, this was it,

829
00:49:30,645 --> 00:49:32,699
and they didn't notice.

830
00:49:33,075 --> 00:49:36,453
So I probably went that full year

831
00:49:36,478 --> 00:49:39,924
until I left my job, with
no one really knowing

832
00:49:39,949 --> 00:49:42,585
that I was dressing with only 33 items.

833
00:49:44,213 --> 00:49:46,673
I do this thing called Project 333,

834
00:49:46,715 --> 00:49:50,010
and it just kind of helps me
keep my order really simple.

835
00:49:50,177 --> 00:49:53,305
I went from this giant closet where I had,

836
00:49:53,506 --> 00:49:56,125
I don't know, 100
sweaters, to now having

837
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:59,954
this super tiny wardrobe
and being able to share

838
00:49:59,979 --> 00:50:01,731
a closet with Logan.

839
00:50:01,814 --> 00:50:04,028
And has made a big difference, just...

840
00:50:04,053 --> 00:50:08,176
I don't fret about what I'm going to put
on in the morning, because all the stuff

841
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:11,742
in my closet is awesome.
At least I think so.

842
00:50:13,167 --> 00:50:15,454
There's something about
not being prepared

843
00:50:15,447 --> 00:50:19,995
for every moment that actually helps
you engage with your community.

844
00:50:20,736 --> 00:50:23,838
Being pregnant, for instance,
is such a limited time.

845
00:50:23,922 --> 00:50:25,674
I had a dress-up events to go to

846
00:50:25,757 --> 00:50:28,343
and I said to David, "Let me
go see if I can find a dress."

847
00:50:28,426 --> 00:50:31,091
And I was thinking, "Gosh,
this is really outdated."

848
00:50:31,116 --> 00:50:33,641
I have two months left.
The event is next week.

849
00:50:33,666 --> 00:50:36,342
What am I gonna do? So I
called a couple of my girlfriends.

850
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:39,738
"Hey, do you any dresses I
can, you know, go through?"

851
00:50:39,763 --> 00:50:41,892
But in the past, you know, I definitely

852
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:44,235
would have bought what
I needed, when I needed it

853
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:45,997
Because that's what you do.

854
00:50:46,022 --> 00:50:49,073
You prepare yourself, you
know, for your situation.

855
00:50:49,098 --> 00:50:51,535
The beauty of that is it
becomes very communal.

856
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,036
Our friends ask us for stuff.

857
00:50:53,061 --> 00:50:56,373
You know, we've become closer
to people because of it.

858
00:50:59,524 --> 00:51:01,759
Mark and I got married in 2005,

859
00:51:01,798 --> 00:51:06,388
and a year later, I
started feeling really bad.

860
00:51:06,451 --> 00:51:10,802
Had a lot of vertigo, and
tingling, and fatigue.

861
00:51:11,671 --> 00:51:13,765
That following year got really bad,

862
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:16,687
and in July, I was diagnosed
with Multiple Sclerosis.

863
00:51:17,338 --> 00:51:21,202
And at first we were both terrified.

864
00:51:21,227 --> 00:51:23,903
It was hard. And that
was a tough time.

865
00:51:24,397 --> 00:51:28,667
I mean immediately, my response
wasn't I got to simplify things.

866
00:51:28,692 --> 00:51:29,676
I'm a slow learner.

867
00:51:29,701 --> 00:51:35,108
So I decided that I had to really
push hard to prove that I was okay.

868
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,226
And so, I worked more.

869
00:51:37,497 --> 00:51:39,128
I worked out more.

870
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:42,256
I really pushed myself for
probably that first month

871
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,268
and I felt terrible.

872
00:51:44,516 --> 00:51:48,396
In any disease or sickness,
one of the biggest factors,

873
00:51:48,421 --> 00:51:51,600
and one of the things that contribute
to these things, in a negative way

874
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:53,240
is the stress in your life.

875
00:51:53,265 --> 00:51:55,604
By getting rid of these
things in our lives,

876
00:51:55,629 --> 00:51:59,174
these material items, and all these
excess that we used to live in,

877
00:51:59,344 --> 00:52:00,763
good things happen.

878
00:52:01,954 --> 00:52:06,699
Since then, I have not had
what I would consider a relapse.

879
00:52:06,864 --> 00:52:11,285
I'm in better health than I
was before I was diagnosed.

880
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,630
People always tell you,
or at least they did for me

881
00:52:14,687 --> 00:52:17,773
in the early stages of MS you
have to listen to your body.

882
00:52:18,028 --> 00:52:20,631
Like listen to my body? I
can't even listen to my family.

883
00:52:20,656 --> 00:52:22,758
I don't know how I'm
going to hear my body.

884
00:52:23,012 --> 00:52:25,895
And so as I started to
move that stuff out,

885
00:52:26,001 --> 00:52:28,905
I was able to finally realize

886
00:52:29,366 --> 00:52:34,813
what I had sacrificed by being
busy, by engaging in constant work.

887
00:52:46,994 --> 00:52:49,161
We have this capacity for focus,

888
00:52:49,762 --> 00:52:54,039
but we're living in a context
where we are continually

889
00:52:54,064 --> 00:52:57,479
moving from one stimulus
to next, in search of the

890
00:52:57,504 --> 00:53:01,478
dopamine experience,
where we rewarded by

891
00:53:01,503 --> 00:53:03,730
the next email, or the next retweet,

892
00:53:03,755 --> 00:53:06,382
or the next thing that comes
into our phone rather often.

893
00:53:09,016 --> 00:53:11,477
I think it's a price we pay for that.

894
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,233
This really become...
has become an issue.

895
00:53:14,311 --> 00:53:15,941
There is a Nokia study
that shows that the average

896
00:53:16,024 --> 00:53:19,319
person checks his or her
phone like a 150 times a day.

897
00:53:26,886 --> 00:53:30,373
You walk down the streets in any major
city. They're locked into their devices.

898
00:53:30,398 --> 00:53:32,316
We're totally in the Matrix.

899
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,612
And it's easier to be mindless
and just read the paper,

900
00:53:35,706 --> 00:53:38,756
Update your social
media feed and consume.

901
00:53:40,335 --> 00:53:42,582
Because you can do anything you want,

902
00:53:42,607 --> 00:53:45,764
you can potentially do
everything you want.

903
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:47,266
[Patrick Rhone, Author, ENOUGH]

904
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:48,902
But to do everything you want,

905
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:52,354
you have to sacrifice for things
that really are important.

906
00:53:52,821 --> 00:53:54,529
When it comes to you overwhelm,

907
00:53:54,553 --> 00:53:57,599
the easiest way to
solve that is to turn it off.

908
00:53:58,754 --> 00:54:00,405
Really, just turn it off.

909
00:54:08,949 --> 00:54:15,421
It was really powerfull to realize
that most of my life was in a daydream.

910
00:54:17,591 --> 00:54:20,070
I got here at ABC News
when I was 28 years old.

911
00:54:20,095 --> 00:54:22,804
I was a really ambitious young guy.

912
00:54:23,397 --> 00:54:27,324
And my way of compensating
for my insecurity

913
00:54:27,349 --> 00:54:32,907
about being such a newbie,
was to throw myself into the job

914
00:54:32,932 --> 00:54:34,400
and really become a workaholic.

915
00:54:34,651 --> 00:54:37,168
And after 9-11, I raised
my hand to go overseas

916
00:54:37,193 --> 00:54:39,614
and cover the ensuing conflicts.

917
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:42,079
We were fortunate this
week to have our reporter

918
00:54:42,104 --> 00:54:45,062
Dan Harris on a trip
organized by the Taliban.

919
00:54:45,273 --> 00:54:48,206
We arrived at night,
a spine rattling ride

920
00:54:48,231 --> 00:54:52,419
down a single mangled road
into a city under siege.

921
00:54:52,503 --> 00:54:55,296
I spent a lot of time
in Iraq and Afghanistan

922
00:54:55,351 --> 00:54:59,475
without really thinking much about
the psychological consequences.

923
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,598
And when I came home from
a particularly long trip in Iraq,

924
00:55:03,623 --> 00:55:05,016
I got depressed.

925
00:55:05,566 --> 00:55:07,228
And then I did something
really really dumb,

926
00:55:07,253 --> 00:55:10,356
in which I started to self-medicate
with recreational drugs.

927
00:55:10,687 --> 00:55:12,463
It was enough, according to my doctor,

928
00:55:12,523 --> 00:55:16,217
to provoke a panic
attack on live television.

929
00:55:16,278 --> 00:55:19,146
We're gonna go now to Dan Harris,
who's at the newsdesk. Dan?

930
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:20,316
Health news now.

931
00:55:20,341 --> 00:55:22,644
One of the world's most
commonly prescribed medication

932
00:55:22,783 --> 00:55:24,563
may be providing a big bonus.

933
00:55:24,677 --> 00:55:27,457
Researchers report, people that
take cholesterol-lowering drugs,

934
00:55:27,482 --> 00:55:29,773
called statins for at least five years,

935
00:55:29,798 --> 00:55:32,404
may also lower their risk for cancer.

936
00:55:32,487 --> 00:55:36,593
But it's too early to prescribe
statins solely for cancer prevention.

937
00:55:37,158 --> 00:55:40,346
That does it for news. We're gonna
go back now to Robin and Charlie.

938
00:55:43,818 --> 00:55:46,747
It raised the level of adrenaline in my
brain which, according to my doctor,

939
00:55:46,772 --> 00:55:49,678
primed me to lose it
on Good Morning America

940
00:55:49,703 --> 00:55:51,204
in front of five million people.

941
00:55:52,545 --> 00:55:55,798
5.019 million people, according
to the Nielsen ratings.

942
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:00,042
That moment set me off
on a weird and windy road

943
00:56:00,067 --> 00:56:03,519
that ultimately led me to the last
thing that I ever thought would

944
00:56:03,544 --> 00:56:06,333
would be useful for anybody,
which was meditation.

945
00:56:14,785 --> 00:56:17,277
We're ruminating about
the past and future

946
00:56:17,302 --> 00:56:21,298
in a way that keeps us
from really connecting

947
00:56:21,323 --> 00:56:26,021
with the present moment, in a
way that values ​​it as good enough.

948
00:56:27,288 --> 00:56:32,319
Meditation is a technique
of finding wellbeing

949
00:56:32,402 --> 00:56:36,324
in the present moment,
before anything happens.

950
00:56:39,984 --> 00:56:42,950
You can be happy and satisfied

951
00:56:43,035 --> 00:56:46,567
simply being aware of the
sensation of breathing.

952
00:56:50,528 --> 00:56:54,771
Very rarely are we fully
dedicated to one thing.

953
00:56:54,796 --> 00:56:56,770
We are interrupting ourselves,
or allowing ourselves

954
00:56:56,795 --> 00:56:59,640
be interrupted by these streams of data

955
00:56:59,665 --> 00:57:02,787
and what would, in any other context,

956
00:57:02,812 --> 00:57:04,164
be thought of as distractions,

957
00:57:04,189 --> 00:57:08,579
but now we think of them as this is
all necessary parts of our bandwidth.

958
00:57:10,369 --> 00:57:13,114
If I leave my phone in my pocket
and it is on vibrate mode,

959
00:57:13,536 --> 00:57:15,908
unconsciously, I'll
flinch when it vibrates.

960
00:57:15,991 --> 00:57:19,996
I even flinch when it doesn't
vibrate, thinking it vibrates.

961
00:57:20,442 --> 00:57:22,589
And that kills that little discussion.

962
00:57:22,614 --> 00:57:26,128
Like, those nanoseconds of distraction,

963
00:57:26,375 --> 00:57:29,045
I think has a hugely
detrimental effect.

964
00:57:29,929 --> 00:57:33,721
Everywhere I look, it's like
constant high frequency flinches.

965
00:57:36,072 --> 00:57:38,675
This anticipation of novelty

966
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:43,588
has the character of making us the
lab rats such as pressing the bar.

967
00:57:44,952 --> 00:57:48,943
Meditation is a great
great antidote to that.

968
00:57:51,598 --> 00:57:53,846
The people around here at
ABC News would asked me

969
00:57:53,895 --> 00:57:55,242
"Why are you meditating?"

970
00:57:55,503 --> 00:57:57,703
Paratactically:
"What's the matter with you?"

971
00:57:57,728 --> 00:57:59,204
What happened to you?

972
00:57:59,468 --> 00:58:01,215
Eventually, I started to answer:

973
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,376
"Oh you know, it's because it
makes me about 10% happier."

974
00:58:03,406 --> 00:58:07,819
And I could see the looks
transform, from scorn slash

975
00:58:07,844 --> 00:58:11,718
skepticism into interest, like
"Oh! That sounds reasonable."

976
00:58:11,743 --> 00:58:12,886
"I'd like that."

977
00:58:14,216 --> 00:58:16,796
One of the best piece of
advice I've ever received

978
00:58:16,792 --> 00:58:19,518
in my entire life was
from a meditation teacher

979
00:58:19,543 --> 00:58:21,020
named Joseph Goldstein.

980
00:58:21,657 --> 00:58:24,381
I was asking him about
the utility of worry.

981
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,484
In the specific context,
I was talking about

982
00:58:26,567 --> 00:58:29,289
whether it made sense to
worry about missing a flight.

983
00:58:29,399 --> 00:58:30,989
And I was arguing to him that:

984
00:58:31,037 --> 00:58:34,235
"Look, you Buddhists are always talking
about how thoughts are just thoughts.

985
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,803
They don't necessarily have
any connection to reality,

986
00:58:36,828 --> 00:58:40,666
but the fact is, if I miss
my flight, I'm screwed."

987
00:58:40,932 --> 00:58:44,087
And he said, "You're
unquestionably correct,

988
00:58:44,212 --> 00:58:47,696
but there is a certain amount
of worry that makes sense

989
00:58:47,751 --> 00:58:49,550
and a certain amount
of worry that doesn't.

990
00:58:49,806 --> 00:58:53,214
So, on the seventeenth time that
you're worrying about missing your flight

991
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:56,100
and all of the horrible ramifications,

992
00:58:56,554 --> 00:58:58,644
maybe ask yourself a simple question:

993
00:58:58,823 --> 00:59:00,062
'Is this useful?' "

994
00:59:01,021 --> 00:59:04,333
Boom! For a guy who spent his
whole life worrying and thinking

995
00:59:04,406 --> 00:59:08,185
that my worrying was the edge
I had over everybody else,

996
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:12,187
because I knew I was going to be
more anxious and more compulsive

997
00:59:12,212 --> 00:59:13,671
than any of my competitors,

998
00:59:13,742 --> 00:59:16,800
I realized that there is a
certain amount of worrying

999
00:59:16,825 --> 00:59:19,750
that is what I call
constructive anguish,

1000
00:59:19,821 --> 00:59:23,379
and then there's useless rumination
that just making you miserable.

1001
00:59:24,296 --> 00:59:27,967
It's not like I'm 100%
mindful all the time.

1002
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:31,513
You know, I still do an
enormous amount of stupid shit,

1003
00:59:31,578 --> 00:59:33,792
and if my wife was
here, she would give you

1004
00:59:33,817 --> 00:59:35,851
the "90% still a moron" spiel.

1005
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:39,889
There is no question that I am
still an idiot in lots of ways,

1006
00:59:39,998 --> 00:59:42,525
but I'm less of an idiot
and less of a jerk,

1007
00:59:42,574 --> 00:59:45,653
and more thoughtful, and
more focused and calmer.

1008
00:59:54,459 --> 00:59:56,326
We've been on tour all year,

1009
00:59:56,412 --> 01:00:01,404
and just when I start to think
if we're getting through,

1010
01:00:01,429 --> 01:00:07,051
if we're making a difference,
the Today Show gives us a call.

1011
01:00:07,384 --> 01:00:09,304
and asks us to be on.

1012
01:00:10,192 --> 01:00:11,863
Now we have an
opportunity to share this

1013
01:00:11,888 --> 01:00:16,519
with millions of people,
which... is... is huge.

1014
01:00:16,951 --> 01:00:19,872
Dude, we're actually late
now, so we got to go.

1015
01:00:20,232 --> 01:00:21,466
The entrance is ...

1016
01:00:21,491 --> 01:00:23,649
What is the address? It's 35?

1017
01:00:23,742 --> 01:00:26,322
Yeah, but you'll see like the
Today Show sussed that up.

1018
01:00:26,405 --> 01:00:27,698
Oh! Right there, there it is.

1019
01:00:28,734 --> 01:00:32,287
- Are you sure this is it?
- Yup. Go down stairs."

1020
01:00:32,370 --> 01:00:33,543
We're in together.

1021
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:40,670
From NBC News,

1022
01:00:41,561 --> 01:00:43,423
this is Today.

1023
01:00:44,862 --> 01:00:46,718
With Black Friday, Cyber ​​Monday,

1024
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:49,115
boughs of holly and stuffed stockings,

1025
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:50,473
It can start to feel like the holidays

1026
01:00:50,498 --> 01:00:53,436
are more about more and less
than about what's really important.

1027
01:00:53,461 --> 01:00:56,423
Joshua Fields Millburn
and Ryan Nicodemus

1028
01:00:56,448 --> 01:00:58,310
have come to see things differently.

1029
01:00:58,335 --> 01:01:01,482
They are what you call ...
The Minimalists.

1030
01:01:01,537 --> 01:01:03,040
In a hypothetical world,

1031
01:01:03,312 --> 01:01:08,138
What if one of you falls madly in love
with a maximalist who likes her stuff?

1032
01:01:08,163 --> 01:01:09,142
What you gonna do?

1033
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:11,396
Well, that's a great question.
My girlfriend, actually I live with

1034
01:01:11,421 --> 01:01:13,443
I don't think she would
call herself a minimalist.

1035
01:01:13,468 --> 01:01:15,666
She's got about 20 pairs of shoes.

1036
01:01:15,691 --> 01:01:16,471
Well, that's not bad.

1037
01:01:16,496 --> 01:01:19,162
- It's nothing compared to what I have.
- Hello?

1038
01:01:19,187 --> 01:01:23,300
But what I will say is that her and I
have very similar values ​​and beliefs.

1039
01:01:23,325 --> 01:01:25,474
We respect one another.
We love one another.

1040
01:01:25,499 --> 01:01:27,045
- We appreciate one another.
- It's a great lifestyle,

1041
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:29,098
- it's a great topic for Today.
- It's great to meet you both.

1042
01:01:29,181 --> 01:01:30,182
- Yeah, Merry Christmas.
- The Minimalist

1043
01:01:30,207 --> 01:01:34,140
latest book, Everything That
Remains, is in stores right now.

1044
01:01:34,165 --> 01:01:35,542
What a concept.

1045
01:01:40,402 --> 01:01:42,144
So the event last night was crazy.

1046
01:01:42,169 --> 01:01:45,281
We showed up, the store
owner had about 30 chairs out.

1047
01:01:45,306 --> 01:01:47,058
I asked him to put out more chairs

1048
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:50,204
and he was like, "Are you sure
you're going to need more chairs?"

1049
01:01:50,427 --> 01:01:53,749
Ken Burns was here and he
maxed out all my seating.

1050
01:01:53,774 --> 01:01:55,334
I got 60 chairs total.

1051
01:01:55,418 --> 01:01:57,915
And I said, "Yeah. I think we'll
have about 50 or 60 people show up."

1052
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,881
Go ahead and bring the
rest of the chairs out.

1053
01:02:00,073 --> 01:02:03,412
And we ended up having like
150, 200 people show up.

1054
01:02:03,437 --> 01:02:07,806
I mean, people were standing on
the bookshelves, wall to wall.

1055
01:02:08,049 --> 01:02:10,142
It's great for coming
out to support us, man.

1056
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:11,662
Okay, thanks for everything you do.

1057
01:02:11,687 --> 01:02:14,480
I think your story
came at the right time.

1058
01:02:14,942 --> 01:02:15,982
Serendipity.

1059
01:02:16,007 --> 01:02:17,667
You guys are my inspiration.

1060
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:20,278
Awesome, thank you so much
for that. I'm glad we could help.

1061
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:21,779
Thanks for coming out, brother.

1062
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,462
We're seeing more and more
and more people show up,

1063
01:02:24,487 --> 01:02:27,453
so, it's great to see that
the message is spreading.

1064
01:02:28,197 --> 01:02:31,373
So we are on our way to Los Angeles.

1065
01:02:31,718 --> 01:02:33,573
It's gonna be our biggest venue so far.

1066
01:02:33,598 --> 01:02:36,705
Expecting one of our biggest
crowd, and really I think

1067
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:39,883
Los Angeles is a city that
can really use this message.

1068
01:03:23,763 --> 01:03:28,178
Cars, homes and six digits salaries.
It may sound like a dream life.

1069
01:03:28,203 --> 01:03:31,427
Joshua Millburn and Ryan
Nicodemus on a world book tour.

1070
01:03:31,452 --> 01:03:35,984
And here to explain why someone
would just give up all of these stuff.

1071
01:03:36,554 --> 01:03:38,718
Letting it go was really very difficult.

1072
01:03:38,743 --> 01:03:41,007
I wish I could say it was as
easy as renting a dumpster

1073
01:03:41,032 --> 01:03:43,743
and throwing away all my stuff,
but it was really a process.

1074
01:04:10,147 --> 01:04:15,419
I love watching how it's spreading
like wildfire, in a good way.

1075
01:04:15,444 --> 01:04:16,988
It's like a good plague.

1076
01:04:25,037 --> 01:04:26,389
A startling new study

1077
01:04:26,414 --> 01:04:29,517
shows a huge number of
children under the age of four

1078
01:04:29,542 --> 01:04:32,671
have access to a mobile
device, and some of those kids

1079
01:04:32,696 --> 01:04:35,966
started using them before
they were one year old.

1080
01:04:36,192 --> 01:04:37,763
We're building more competitive

1081
01:04:37,747 --> 01:04:39,981
more interesting environments
for the consumer.

1082
01:04:40,006 --> 01:04:43,680
This means adjusting signals their
telling us about their interests,

1083
01:04:43,705 --> 01:04:46,644
and making sure we can control
what message they see next.

1084
01:04:46,712 --> 01:04:48,233
The Toronto based ad executive

1085
01:04:48,258 --> 01:04:50,069
has written an op-ed
in the Globe and Mail

1086
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:52,775
saying it's time we stop
advertising to children.

1087
01:04:53,408 --> 01:04:57,072
Advertising for children
has existed for so long.

1088
01:04:57,323 --> 01:05:01,598
What's changed though, is the amount
of this advertising and the media

1089
01:05:01,623 --> 01:05:04,038
through which these advertising comes.

1090
01:05:05,013 --> 01:05:06,907
Historically, companies

1091
01:05:06,932 --> 01:05:10,149
who'd had products aimed at
kids would go toward the mothers

1092
01:05:10,174 --> 01:05:13,215
and getting the mothers to want
to buy the stuff for their kids.

1093
01:05:13,794 --> 01:05:18,053
What happens is that companies
decide to go around the mothers

1094
01:05:18,177 --> 01:05:20,014
and go directly to the kids.

1095
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:25,201
I don't know what the most common
three words are in American homes.

1096
01:05:25,402 --> 01:05:28,738
I don't know if it's "I love
you" or if it's "I want that".

1097
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:32,703
5,000 advertisements
we see every single day,

1098
01:05:32,728 --> 01:05:34,947
from the moment we're born.

1099
01:05:35,209 --> 01:05:38,132
And they all tell us, "Hey, this
is what your life should be about."

1100
01:05:38,157 --> 01:05:40,768
It should be about
accumulating more things

1101
01:05:40,793 --> 01:05:43,580
or it should all be
about focusing on you.

1102
01:05:44,979 --> 01:05:48,711
If you guys have walked around,
you know, a kid's store lately,

1103
01:05:48,927 --> 01:05:51,068
but it's kind of incredible.

1104
01:05:51,093 --> 01:05:55,009
Anything you ever could have
dreamed of has been thought of.

1105
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:58,575
Advertisers have just realized
there's this huge market.

1106
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,209
There are parents who want to
[Christine Koh, Minimalist Parenting]

1107
01:06:01,234 --> 01:06:05,649
give their kids the best, and they're
really working hard to go that angle.

1108
01:06:06,313 --> 01:06:10,277
In 1983, companies spent
$100 million marketing to children.

1109
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:14,447
In 2006, companies spent $17 billion.

1110
01:06:14,442 --> 01:06:18,315
There is a problem, of
both process and content,

1111
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:20,885
and the problem of content is huge.

1112
01:06:21,229 --> 01:06:25,729
The products that are being
advertised to kids are junk.

1113
01:06:25,791 --> 01:06:27,830
Welcome to Mutant Mania Wrestling.

1114
01:06:27,855 --> 01:06:30,029
One hundred and twenty new
characters you can collect.

1115
01:06:30,054 --> 01:06:32,133
The secret is their flexi-spine!

1116
01:06:32,576 --> 01:06:36,193
It's a junk culture. It's
food that's bad for them.

1117
01:06:36,218 --> 01:06:40,601
It's crappy toys, that
are gendered and violent.

1118
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:46,106
I don't see the argument for
subjecting children to this,

1119
01:06:46,181 --> 01:06:49,360
Like, there's no positive
social benefit from it.

1120
01:06:49,898 --> 01:06:51,648
We just know there's a negative,

1121
01:06:51,719 --> 01:06:54,335
and it's just the political
power of advertising

1122
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:56,651
and the companies that
do the advertising that,

1123
01:06:56,676 --> 01:06:58,871
keeps us from doing
something about it.

1124
01:07:04,926 --> 01:07:07,949
So I've heard someone say,
"There is another word for minimalism,

1125
01:07:07,974 --> 01:07:09,902
it's called being a bachelor.

1126
01:07:10,098 --> 01:07:12,510
So it's.. Yeah, I mean, I could see how
[Leo Babauta, Husband & father of six]

1127
01:07:12,535 --> 01:07:16,139
people would think. Oh that's really easy
if you're not married and you have no kids.

1128
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:20,530
How do set an example
of myself, being married

1129
01:07:20,555 --> 01:07:25,066
and having six kids, which is
totally un-minimalist and very ironic?

1130
01:07:25,828 --> 01:07:30,821
How do I live a minimalist lifestyle
with those kinds of constraints?

1131
01:07:32,705 --> 01:07:36,338
Jaqueline and I haven't been
too prescriptive about, like

1132
01:07:36,486 --> 01:07:38,596
"You have five toys" you know.

1133
01:07:38,675 --> 01:07:41,605
No, dude. You can only have one truck.
You can't have three trucks" you know.

1134
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:44,817
It's like now, when I was a little
kid, I didn't have one GI Joe.

1135
01:07:44,842 --> 01:07:47,044
Oh I had like 100 GI Joes.

1136
01:07:47,747 --> 01:07:51,366
We've welcomed things into our lives,
but definitely with the intention of

1137
01:07:51,391 --> 01:07:57,350
thinking about what we're doing
as opposed to just consuming.

1138
01:07:57,889 --> 01:08:00,516
When you live with other people

1139
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:04,607
and your family, you can't
just make unilateral decisions.

1140
01:08:04,632 --> 01:08:07,778
"Okay, we're now getting rid of everything
and throwing the TV out the door."

1141
01:08:07,903 --> 01:08:09,697
There will be a riot.

1142
01:08:11,075 --> 01:08:14,661
That's a little bit frustrating,
because you can't just get your way.

1143
01:08:15,005 --> 01:08:17,664
But it's also a really
interesting experiment

1144
01:08:17,673 --> 01:08:20,374
and how you can move
together as a group

1145
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:22,437
and learn about this
together as a group.

1146
01:08:30,446 --> 01:08:33,889
At the very beginning, when
we decided to live with less,

1147
01:08:34,492 --> 01:08:37,859
we knew early on that
minimalism would just

1148
01:08:37,935 --> 01:08:41,356
gonna look like the way
we wanted it to look.

1149
01:08:42,401 --> 01:08:44,651
I remember going through
getting rid of things

1150
01:08:44,676 --> 01:08:47,981
and finally saying, "Okay, Sam.
Let's go through your toys

1151
01:08:48,006 --> 01:08:50,520
and let's get rid of some of the
things you don't need any more."

1152
01:08:50,545 --> 01:08:54,036
And he had no problem whatsoever.

1153
01:08:55,555 --> 01:09:00,543
My daughter is seven and
she is very different.

1154
01:09:01,794 --> 01:09:04,965
She loves every doll that she can get.

1155
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:10,348
She collects rocks, twigs and
any thing else you can find.

1156
01:09:10,373 --> 01:09:13,307
She collects and she holds on to.

1157
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:16,803
You know, as parents, we get to to
set some boundaries for her but,

1158
01:09:16,828 --> 01:09:19,731
but ultimately, we let
her choose what she wants.

1159
01:09:21,175 --> 01:09:23,965
I think he certainly has been

1160
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:26,122
at a different level of minimalism...
[Kim Becker, Co-Founder, The Hope Effect]

1161
01:09:26,147 --> 01:09:28,310
than I am.
[Kim Becker, Co-Founder, The Hope Effect]

1162
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:31,388
He wanted to get rid of more than I wanted to get rid of,

1163
01:09:31,413 --> 01:09:33,704
and so there comes the compromise.

1164
01:09:35,639 --> 01:09:40,803
His side of the closet looks much
smaller than my side of the closet.

1165
01:09:40,904 --> 01:09:43,006
And that's okay with us.

1166
01:09:43,703 --> 01:09:45,187
You know, I think one
of the lessons that

1167
01:09:45,212 --> 01:09:47,953
that we learned through
this whole journey

1168
01:09:47,978 --> 01:09:51,181
is just... that our kids
are really watching us.

1169
01:09:51,492 --> 01:09:54,865
And we can tell them that we
want them to be certain people,

1170
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:57,486
but, man, they're picking
up a lot more just

1171
01:09:57,525 --> 01:10:00,191
from how we...
how we live our lives.

1172
01:10:02,126 --> 01:10:04,407
This is undercurrent of consumerism.

1173
01:10:04,432 --> 01:10:08,829
Removing some of that stuff
provided a safe environment

1174
01:10:08,854 --> 01:10:11,637
where they are able to become
what they most want to be,

1175
01:10:11,662 --> 01:10:14,498
rather than what the world will
try to convince them to be.

1176
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:19,539
Good evening.

1177
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:24,634
It's clear that the true
problems of our nation

1178
01:10:25,109 --> 01:10:29,586
are much deeper,
deeper than gasoline lines

1179
01:10:29,611 --> 01:10:33,978
or energy shortages, deeper
even than inflation or recession.

1180
01:10:35,471 --> 01:10:38,941
In a nation that was
proud of hard work,

1181
01:10:40,012 --> 01:10:43,989
strong families, close knit communities,

1182
01:10:45,364 --> 01:10:50,412
too many of us now tend to
worship self indulgence.

1183
01:10:51,436 --> 01:10:52,952
and consumption.

1184
01:10:55,249 --> 01:11:01,382
Human identity is no longer
defined by what one does,

1185
01:11:03,102 --> 01:11:05,479
but by what one owns.

1186
01:11:09,104 --> 01:11:14,855
But we've discovered that owning
things and consuming things

1187
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:20,068
does not satisfy our
longing for meaning.

1188
01:11:21,521 --> 01:11:26,115
We've learned that piling up
material goods cannot fill

1189
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:30,997
the emptiness of lives which
have no confidence or purpose.

1190
01:11:33,376 --> 01:11:37,880
This is not a message of
happiness or reassurance,

1191
01:11:38,339 --> 01:11:42,885
but it is the truth,
and it is a warning.

1192
01:11:47,246 --> 01:11:49,100
We think we need those things,

1193
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:51,686
because we've been told
we need those things.

1194
01:11:52,692 --> 01:11:56,691
We've been told we need
those things by our society.

1195
01:12:00,381 --> 01:12:04,623
It's been this kind of slow little
thing, that's just kind of trickle down

1196
01:12:04,648 --> 01:12:07,203
and suddenly it becomes
the thing you do.

1197
01:12:09,771 --> 01:12:14,086
It really does come down
to a value based ideal.

1198
01:12:14,412 --> 01:12:17,787
You want to do the most amount of good

1199
01:12:17,812 --> 01:12:21,635
and get the most amount of value
with exactly what you need.

1200
01:12:24,244 --> 01:12:26,087
Having too little is not
going to give you that,

1201
01:12:26,112 --> 01:12:29,060
and having too much is not
going to give you that, right?

1202
01:12:31,356 --> 01:12:36,402
Having that balance, having enough,
that's what you're looking for.

1203
01:12:42,181 --> 01:12:44,576
If I had to revise the American Dream,

1204
01:12:44,751 --> 01:12:49,124
it would be more about
coming together in community.

1205
01:12:50,115 --> 01:12:52,537
It would be more about a society

1206
01:12:52,562 --> 01:12:55,341
which had much less
inequality and more fairness,

1207
01:12:55,366 --> 01:12:57,590
in which everybody had a chance,

1208
01:12:58,748 --> 01:13:03,055
and that is responsible toward
the planet and our ecosystem.

1209
01:13:03,383 --> 01:13:05,641
To me, that would be an American Dream.

1210
01:13:08,219 --> 01:13:10,364
When you talk about not consuming,

1211
01:13:10,389 --> 01:13:13,483
people think, well, you're trying
to take something away from them.

1212
01:13:15,737 --> 01:13:17,237
But the truth of the matter is that

1213
01:13:17,262 --> 01:13:19,522
I think that what this
movement is really about

1214
01:13:19,547 --> 01:13:21,895
is questing after a life
that's good for ourselves

1215
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,827
and good for the people around us.

1216
01:13:36,551 --> 01:13:38,260
So we're in Los Angeles now.

1217
01:13:39,137 --> 01:13:42,681
We're here for our biggest event.

1218
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:45,410
What we're trying to do is show people

1219
01:13:45,435 --> 01:13:50,772
there is a different
way for us to live.

1220
01:13:53,017 --> 01:13:54,814
The people you bring into your live,

1221
01:13:54,839 --> 01:13:56,509
you should always be
hanging out with people

1222
01:13:56,534 --> 01:13:59,562
who have the same values ​​and that's
really what minimalism is all about.

1223
01:13:59,587 --> 01:14:01,451
It's about living deliberately.

1224
01:14:01,946 --> 01:14:04,956
So every choice that I make,
every relationship, every item,

1225
01:14:04,981 --> 01:14:07,440
every dollar I spend,
I'm not perfect, obviously,

1226
01:14:07,465 --> 01:14:10,268
but I do constantly ask the
question: "Is this adding value?"

1227
01:14:10,293 --> 01:14:12,505
Am I being deliberate
with this decision?

1228
01:14:13,007 --> 01:14:15,515
Go see 'em tonight at The Last
Bookstore in Los Angeles, at 7 o'clock.

1229
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:17,611
Thank you, Joshua and
Ryan for coming in.

1230
01:14:17,636 --> 01:14:18,929
The Last Bookstore
Spring Arts Collective

1231
01:14:20,257 --> 01:14:22,924
I didn't realize it at the time,

1232
01:14:22,949 --> 01:14:28,147
but I was so focused on
what my idea of success was.

1233
01:14:28,868 --> 01:14:33,611
My idea of ​​success was
making more money.

1234
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:37,073
Consumer relationships were a priority.

1235
01:14:38,097 --> 01:14:40,869
Well, I didn't pay any attention
to the people closest to me,

1236
01:14:42,632 --> 01:14:45,051
including my mom.

1237
01:14:47,124 --> 01:14:50,343
The whole point of this message,
the whole point of us sharing this story,

1238
01:14:50,368 --> 01:14:55,635
is to help people curb that
appetite for more things,

1239
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:59,556
because it's such a
destructive path to go down.

1240
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:04,157
I literally had used
people to sell cell phones.

1241
01:15:04,182 --> 01:15:08,732
I've used people to get
bigger and better clients.

1242
01:15:09,161 --> 01:15:13,237
And what I love about my life
now is that I can be genuine.

1243
01:15:13,614 --> 01:15:15,694
And that there is no manipulation.

1244
01:15:16,686 --> 01:15:18,366
It is my very, very great pleasure

1245
01:15:18,391 --> 01:15:23,614
to introduce Joshua Fields Millburn and
Ryan Nicodemus, the Minimalists.

1246
01:15:31,882 --> 01:15:35,429
Imagine a life with less,
a life of passion,

1247
01:15:35,454 --> 01:15:39,599
unencumbered by the trappings
of the chaotic world around you.

1248
01:15:40,766 --> 01:15:45,272
Well, what you're imagining
is an intentional life.

1249
01:15:45,995 --> 01:15:51,653
It is not a perfect life, and it is not
even an easy life, but a simple one.

1250
01:15:53,255 --> 01:15:54,615
What I found with minimalism is that

1251
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,827
it's a way of saying,
"Let's stop the madness."

1252
01:15:58,630 --> 01:16:01,607
You don't need these stuff.
Like it's not going to do it.

1253
01:16:01,911 --> 01:16:03,162
It's not the answer.

1254
01:16:03,645 --> 01:16:05,233
There's a movement growing.

1255
01:16:05,578 --> 01:16:08,791
I don't think that there's a cap to it.

1256
01:16:09,055 --> 01:16:10,655
I'm now surrounded by people

1257
01:16:10,656 --> 01:16:14,181
who are inspired and creating
massive social change and impact.

1258
01:16:14,213 --> 01:16:16,663
The depth and profundity
of my relationship

1259
01:16:16,665 --> 01:16:19,892
is beyond anything I
could ever imagine.

1260
01:16:19,917 --> 01:16:22,961
When you recognise
that this life is yours,

1261
01:16:22,986 --> 01:16:26,147
and that it is your one and only,
and when that ceases to be

1262
01:16:26,172 --> 01:16:30,988
to be esoteric bullshit, when
that's not hippie poetry any more,

1263
01:16:31,013 --> 01:16:33,008
when the pragmatism of that statement

1264
01:16:33,033 --> 01:16:37,211
seeps directly in your bones,
and you recognise that this is it,

1265
01:16:37,929 --> 01:16:39,872
everything changes.

1266
01:16:40,661 --> 01:16:43,208
I don't know where you
are on your journey,

1267
01:16:43,233 --> 01:16:46,964
where you are in life, or wherever
you're going on that journey,

1268
01:16:46,997 --> 01:16:49,505
but we're really grateful
you're here with us tonight.

1269
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:52,126
So if I could give one takeaway,

1270
01:16:52,446 --> 01:16:56,390
one thing to bring away from
all of this, it would be this:

1271
01:16:57,306 --> 01:17:03,497
Love people and use things,
because the opposite never works.

1272
01:17:03,898 --> 01:17:05,650
Thank you so much for coming out.

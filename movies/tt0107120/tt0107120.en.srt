I want to show you something.

Give you an idea of
exactly what we're dealing with.

"William Butcherson"? "Lost soul"?

524
00:37:23,915 --> 00:37:26,168
Billy Butcherson was Winifred's lover.

525
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:28,503
But she found him sporting
with her sister, Sarah.

526
00:37:28,587 --> 00:37:32,257
So she poisoned him and sewed
his mouth shut with a dull needle,

527
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,718
so he couldn't tell her secrets
even in death.

528
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,678
Winifred always was the jealous type.

- I hate Halloween.

The magic that brought us back

Fortunately, the potion
I brewed the night we were hanged

547
00:38:29,856 --> 00:38:32,526
would keep us alive and young forever.

548
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:36,321
Unfortunately, the recipe for
that potion is in my spell book,

549
00:38:36,404 --> 00:38:37,906
and the little wretches have stolen it.

550
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:41,409
Therefore, it stands to reason,
does it not, sisters dear,

551
00:38:41,493 --> 00:38:44,162
that we must find the book,
brew the potion,

552
00:38:44,246 --> 00:38:47,916
and suck the lives out of
the children of Salem before sunrise?

553
00:38:47,999 --> 00:38:50,919
Otherwise, it's curtains! We evaporate!

and then you sorta

Come! We fly!

559
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:09,437
Because of me, my little
sister's life was stolen.

560
00:39:10,063 --> 00:39:12,232
For years I waited for my life to end,

561
00:39:12,274 --> 00:39:14,484
so I could be reunited with my family.

562
00:39:14,901 --> 00:39:18,905
But Winifred's curse
of immortality kept me alive.

563
00:39:18,947 --> 00:39:21,783
Then one day I figured out
what to do with my eternal life.

564
00:39:22,284 --> 00:39:25,704
Now, I'd failed Emily,
but I wouldn't fail again.

When Winifred
and her sisters returned,

566
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:30,292
I'd be there to stop them.

their house on All Hallows' night,

dangerous spells. She must not get it.

Well, let's torch the sucker.

(WINNIE CACKLING)

1278
01:25:30,257 --> 01:25:33,969
All right, you little trollimog.

1279
01:25:34,053 --> 01:25:35,888
Hold on, Dani!

1280
01:25:39,725 --> 01:25:42,227
This'll teach you to call people ugly.

1281
01:25:43,354 --> 01:25:44,396
Open your mouth.

1282
01:25:45,230 --> 01:25:47,107
Open your mouth, I say!

1283
01:25:47,191 --> 01:25:49,693
WINNIE: Confound you!

1284
01:25:55,449 --> 01:25:58,243
- Give me that vial!
- Put her down or I'll smash it!

1285
01:25:58,285 --> 01:25:59,703
Smash it and she dies!

1286
01:26:01,413 --> 01:26:03,165
- Max!
- No!

1287
01:26:07,002 --> 01:26:08,045
Max, no!

1288
01:26:13,926 --> 01:26:15,678
Now you have no choice!

1289
01:26:16,261 --> 01:26:17,513
You have to take me.

1290
01:26:24,561 --> 01:26:27,898
What a fool to give up thy life

1291
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:29,858
for thy sister's.

1292
01:26:29,983 --> 01:26:30,984
(DANI SCREAMS)

1293
01:26:31,652 --> 01:26:33,570
DANI: Max!

1294
01:26:33,612 --> 01:26:36,198
- Dani!
- Allison, Billy.

1295
01:26:40,285 --> 01:26:41,286
Put him down!

1296
01:26:41,745 --> 01:26:44,081
- Boy!
- Max!

1297
01:26:45,374 --> 01:26:46,375
(BOTH GROANING)

1298
01:26:52,798 --> 01:26:53,799
DANI: Max!

1299
01:26:56,927 --> 01:26:59,638
Hallowed ground! Sisters!

1300
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:02,307
- Winnie, I'm coming!
-(VACUUM STARTS)

1301
01:27:08,147 --> 01:27:10,816
Pull! Harder!

1302
01:27:10,899 --> 01:27:12,359
Harder!

1303
01:27:14,236 --> 01:27:17,656
I'm going to teach you
a lesson you'll never forget!

1304
01:27:18,490 --> 01:27:19,491
Sarah!

1305
01:27:25,372 --> 01:27:28,292
Come on. Come and get me!

1306
01:27:35,758 --> 01:27:37,718
Let go now!

1307
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:39,261
(SCREAMING)

1308
01:27:43,474 --> 01:27:44,475

1310
01:27:54,151 --> 01:27:55,152
(GROANS)

1311
01:28:29,561 --> 01:28:32,689
Book.

1312
01:28:44,618 --> 01:28:47,746
Winnie! Goodbye.

1313
01:28:49,665 --> 01:28:50,666
Uh-oh.

1314
01:28:51,458 --> 01:28:53,293
Bye-bye.

1315
01:29:06,265 --> 01:29:07,266
(MEOWING WEAKLY)

1316
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:18,819
Oh, yeah.

1317
01:29:20,821 --> 01:29:21,905
DANI: Max!

1318
01:29:29,663 --> 01:29:32,499
Max, are you okay?

1319
01:29:34,668 --> 01:29:37,462
Yeah, I think so.

1320
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:39,423
You saved my life.

1321
01:29:39,923 --> 01:29:42,217
Well, I had to. I'm your big brother.

1322
01:29:43,427 --> 01:29:44,845
I love you, jerkface.

1323
01:29:45,596 --> 01:29:47,264
I love you, too.

1324
01:29:50,642 --> 01:29:52,227
Come on.

1325
01:29:59,192 --> 01:30:02,195
Bye, Billy. Have a nice sleep.

1326
01:30:02,279 --> 01:30:03,280
Hey, Billy.

1327
01:30:06,491 --> 01:30:07,618
Thanks.

1328
01:30:15,334 --> 01:30:17,753
Where's Binx?

1329
01:30:17,836 --> 01:30:20,047
Binx?

1330
01:30:20,130 --> 01:30:21,757
Binx?

1331
01:30:24,009 --> 01:30:25,177
Binx!

1332
01:30:28,764 --> 01:30:31,141
He's gone. He's gone, Dani.

1333
01:30:31,183 --> 01:30:32,643
But he can't die, remember?

1334
01:30:35,437 --> 01:30:38,065
Wake up, Binx. Binx, wake up.

1335
01:30:40,275 --> 01:30:42,152
Like last time!

1336
01:30:48,075 --> 01:30:49,201
THACKERY: Dani.

1337
01:30:49,952 --> 01:30:53,205
Come on. Please don't be sad for me.

1338
01:30:53,956 --> 01:30:54,957
Binx?

1339
01:30:55,624 --> 01:30:57,668
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

1340
01:31:01,546 --> 01:31:05,133
The witches are dead.
My soul's finally free.

1341
01:31:11,390 --> 01:31:12,766
You freed me, Dani.

1342
01:31:12,849 --> 01:31:16,228
Thank you. Hey, Max.

1343
01:31:17,771 --> 01:31:19,523
Thanks for lighting the candle.

1344
01:31:22,567 --> 01:31:24,111
EMILY: Thackery.

1345
01:31:24,236 --> 01:31:26,238
Thackery Binx.

1346
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:32,119
It's Emily.

1347
01:31:36,915 --> 01:31:38,917
I shall always be with you.

1348
01:32:02,858 --> 01:32:05,944
Thackery Binx, what took thee so long?

1349
01:32:05,986 --> 01:32:07,362
I'm sorry, Emily.

1350
01:32:07,446 --> 01:32:11,533
I had to wait 300 years
for a virgin to light a candle.

1351
01:32:43,815 --> 01:32:46,276
JENNY: I put a spell on you.
(LAUGHING)

1352
01:32:50,447 --> 01:32:52,491
I put a spell on you.

1353
01:32:55,952 --> 01:32:57,496
And I thought LA was a party town.

1354
01:32:57,537 --> 01:32:59,831
Yeah. Wow.

1355
01:33:01,875 --> 01:33:04,669
Row, row, row your boat

1356
01:33:04,711 --> 01:33:07,589
- Gently down the stream
- Row, row, row your boat

1357
01:33:07,672 --> 01:33:09,674
- Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
- Gently down the stream

1358
01:33:10,509 --> 01:33:13,261
- Life is but a dream
- Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

1359

- Row, row, row your boat

1363
01:33:25,190 --> 01:33:27,818
My Whammy fell on you

1364
01:33:27,859 --> 01:33:31,530
- And it was strong
- So strong, so strong, so strong

1365
01:33:31,571 --> 01:33:34,699
Your wretched little lives
Have all been cursed

She'll deny you!

If you don't believe
You'd better get superstitious

1371
01:33:54,678 --> 01:33:57,806
- Ask my sisters
- She's vicious!

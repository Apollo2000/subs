3
00:02:09,309 --> 00:02:10,679
Anne.

4
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,318
Anne, come in.

5
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:23,325
Anne.

6
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,129
I'm here, go 'head.

7
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:27,130
Ask Cully if
he's got a leaf spring

8
00:02:27,162 --> 00:02:28,131
for a griffin.

9
00:02:28,163 --> 00:02:30,634
Just had one break on me.

10
00:02:30,668 --> 00:02:31,635
Leaf spring.

11
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:32,803
Got it.

12
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:33,904
Griffin leaf spring.

13
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:36,674
Make sure you say griffin
or he'll give you a lancer.

14
00:02:37,507 --> 00:02:39,144
Anything else?

15
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:40,145
That's it.

16
00:02:40,177 --> 00:02:41,178
Over and out.

17
00:03:08,576 --> 00:03:09,544
Fox.

18
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:15,883
Raccoon.

19
00:03:43,413 --> 00:03:44,815
Where's the rest?

20
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:50,789
It's back.

21
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:10,077
Manual job search begins

22
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,812
for young men of
Fullman right now.

23
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:14,916
Camped out in the best
land building on main.

24
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:16,084
At seven o'clock we have

25
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:18,352
a Winnipeg temperature
of 11 celsius.

26
00:04:18,452 --> 00:04:20,454
Carol Sadler with the
ACKY morning news.

27
00:04:20,487 --> 00:04:22,690
On the sky watch
is Captain John.

28
00:04:26,996 --> 00:04:28,264
Now a
steady flow of traffic up

29
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:30,166
to the narrow overpass
once you're in downtown.

30
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,440
And traffic will remain
steady through there.

31
00:04:38,474 --> 00:04:39,976
Two lanes on the south
side of the street.

32
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,147
I'll be back with a full
report with sky watch at seven.

33
00:04:44,882 --> 00:04:47,852
10 furs times 11.

34
00:04:47,885 --> 00:04:48,886
110.

35
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:49,954
11?

36
00:04:49,987 --> 00:04:50,955
It was 20 in June.

37
00:04:50,988 --> 00:04:52,290
That was peak off season.

38
00:04:52,322 --> 00:04:53,457
Didn't sell.

39
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:54,893
It'll all go for 11 now.

40
00:04:54,993 --> 00:04:57,062
Can't even take that
coon and muskrat there.

41
00:04:57,996 --> 00:04:59,865
How much for the beaver?

42
00:04:59,898 --> 00:05:01,233
Eight.

43
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,339
Is there anything
that didn't drop?

44
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:08,975
Mink and Martin went up.

45
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,243
Wolf is 175.

46
00:05:10,342 --> 00:05:11,679
Wolverine's 300.

47
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:18,018
I can see already you don't
got enough for all this stuff.

48
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,523
Might have to work out
what you need the most.

49
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:25,026
I need a leaf spring.

50
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:26,895
Griffin.

51
00:07:18,018 --> 00:07:19,653
You wanna be real careful.

52
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:21,855
You just wanna cut the skin.

53
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:23,323
You don't wanna
slice the organs.

54
00:07:23,357 --> 00:07:25,559
You don't wanna
puncture the stomach

55
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:28,229
'cause it'll make a mess
and it'll spoil the meat.

56
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,189
Every animal in the
forest has enough brains

57
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,192
to tan its own hide.

58
00:07:57,194 --> 00:07:58,162
Except one.

59
00:07:58,195 --> 00:07:59,830
A moose.

60
00:08:12,778 --> 00:08:14,213
200 is an insult.

61
00:08:15,214 --> 00:08:16,249
I had to cut our supplies.

62
00:08:16,282 --> 00:08:18,284
I couldn't get any food.

63
00:08:18,384 --> 00:08:21,287
I'll have to go back next
week with castor sides.

64
00:08:21,387 --> 00:08:23,524
It's the season.

65
00:08:23,557 --> 00:08:25,759
People don't need
fur 'til it's cold.

66
00:08:25,793 --> 00:08:28,062
Prices are a quarter of
what they were two years ago.

67
00:08:28,095 --> 00:08:29,396
Costs are almost double.

68
00:08:30,464 --> 00:08:33,201
Muskrats are worthless
so I'll stop baiting them.

69
00:08:33,234 --> 00:08:36,237
Put down more body grips from
Martin's down at the river.

70
00:08:37,472 --> 00:08:39,541
Castors out there steady.

71
00:08:39,574 --> 00:08:40,642
Beavers are worth it.

72
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,413
Take it off the table.

73
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,548
I'm working on it.

74
00:08:45,581 --> 00:08:47,249
Not while we eat.

75
00:08:54,424 --> 00:08:56,326
My love, how was your day?

76
00:08:57,761 --> 00:08:59,796
Dad let me do everything.

77
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,233
I found this weird bug with
orange hair all over it.

78
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:03,968
A bug with orange hair?

79
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,303
Yeah, Tova ate it.

80
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,171
What kind was it?

81
00:09:07,271 --> 00:09:08,272
Did you ask your dad?

82
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,942
Never heard a name for it.

83
00:09:12,144 --> 00:09:14,012
Bug with orange
hair is fine though.

84
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,983
And the wolf is back.

85
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,985
Ate a raccoon and left the paw.

86
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,688
The back leg.

87
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:28,294
You weren't gonna tell me?

88
00:09:28,328 --> 00:09:29,996
I didn't wanna
upset you again.

89
00:09:34,635 --> 00:09:36,103
Renee, take your
food into your room.

90
00:09:36,137 --> 00:09:37,171
Can't I just cover my ears?

91
00:09:37,204 --> 00:09:39,306
Do as you're told please.

92
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,675
Won't be long.

93
00:09:41,343 --> 00:09:42,677
Go on.

94
00:09:51,487 --> 00:09:53,189
You were gonna put us
in danger with no warning?

95
00:09:53,222 --> 00:09:54,323
We're in no danger.

96
00:09:56,225 --> 00:09:58,194
It's just a hungry wolf
looking for an easy meal.

97
00:09:58,227 --> 00:09:59,228
It's the same one.

98
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,668
Something's bringing it back.

99
00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:07,304
Either it's food
or it's a female.

100
00:10:07,337 --> 00:10:08,805
If I find out what
it's attracted to,

101
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:09,807
I could use it to bait it.

102
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:11,176
It's attracted to us.

103
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,478
It's taking from the trap line.

104
00:10:13,511 --> 00:10:15,747
It already knows we're
a steady food supply.

105
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,520
We're reporting it this time.

106
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,893
Fish cops gonna do
something I can't?

107
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,397
Maybe they can catch it.

108
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,570
We don't run
from our troubles.

109
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:37,838
We bring our problems to them.

110
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:39,340
They bring their problems to us.

111
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:41,442
At least I have good reason
to be worried about the wolf.

112
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:42,510
You're scared of people.

113
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:43,878
Enough.

114
00:10:49,718 --> 00:10:51,753
I'll go out tomorrow morning.

115
00:10:51,787 --> 00:10:54,256
If it's there, I will catch it.

116
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:56,425
It's not just the wolf.

117
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,962
The garden's done and
we can't afford food.

118
00:10:59,062 --> 00:11:00,430
The season's turned
and we have no money

119
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:01,764
for the winter move.

120
00:11:01,798 --> 00:11:03,566
What if we can't make it
out before the freeze?

121
00:11:06,971 --> 00:11:08,272
What's the end of this?

122
00:11:11,442 --> 00:11:12,577
Say what you're gonna say.

123
00:11:22,954 --> 00:11:24,422
Just think about it.

124
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,959
We got no money for food.

125
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:30,597
We're gonna buy a
house in the city.

126
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:31,897
Kearney isn't a city.

127
00:11:31,931 --> 00:11:33,833
It isn't even a town,
but there's a school

128
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:36,837
and it's still close
enough to the trap line.

129
00:11:36,937 --> 00:11:37,904
We could talk to a bank.

130
00:11:37,938 --> 00:11:39,607
I could get a job.

131
00:11:43,277 --> 00:11:44,511
She's been in
there long enough.

132
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:46,114
She's gonna think
we're punishing her.

133
00:11:47,448 --> 00:11:48,416
We'll talk about this later.

134
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:49,450
Yeah.

135
00:11:52,787 --> 00:11:55,659
He was mastered by the
sheer sure dream of life.

136
00:11:55,692 --> 00:11:57,459
The tidal wave of being.

137
00:11:57,493 --> 00:12:01,330
The perfect joy of each separate
muscle, joint and sinew,

138
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:04,367
and that it was everything
that was not death.

139
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:06,536
That it was a glow and rampant.

140
00:12:07,537 --> 00:12:09,005
Mom, what does rampant mean?

141
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,441
I'm not sure.

142
00:12:11,474 --> 00:12:12,442
You're all done.

143
00:12:12,475 --> 00:12:13,612
Go get ready for bed.

144
00:12:27,993 --> 00:12:29,194
This is a hard life.

145
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,467
Life is hard everywhere.

146
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,169
This is harder.

147
00:12:37,036 --> 00:12:38,404
You chose it and it suits you.

148
00:12:40,573 --> 00:12:42,376
I chose it when I chose you.

149
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:46,380
And it suits me.

150
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,085
Renee never had a choice.

151
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,659
She should be in school.

152
00:12:56,692 --> 00:13:00,696
She should be worried
about math and boys.

153
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:02,531
Not wolves.

154
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,867
She's not scared of a wolf.

155
00:13:05,935 --> 00:13:07,269
You are.

156
00:13:09,438 --> 00:13:10,539
I never finished school.

157
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:13,845
Does that make me weak?

158
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,879
It's not about
being weak or strong.

159
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,617
People don't live
like this anymore.

160
00:13:22,053 --> 00:13:24,555
It feels like the world
has left us behind.

161
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,394
There isn't another
generation left.

162
00:13:31,731 --> 00:13:33,065
There is if we make one.

163
00:13:37,737 --> 00:13:38,872
This is our life.

164
00:13:40,473 --> 00:13:42,710
This is our home.

165
00:13:42,743 --> 00:13:46,246
Nothing pushes us out
of our home or our life.

166
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,581
Not even you.

167
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,636
Goodnight.

168
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,691
Not today.

169
00:15:56,724 --> 00:15:57,725
Stay home and help your
mother with the chores.

170
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,726
I wanna help catch him.

171
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,093
You're too young.

172
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:01,461
First get used to
the animals that run,

173
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:02,931
then you can hunt
the ones that chase.

174
00:16:02,964 --> 00:16:04,232
Grandpa took
you hunting wolves

175
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:05,801
when you were eight
and I'm almost 13.

176
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:07,468
I was twice as mean.

177
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:08,536
Took me half the time.

178
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,939
I don't have to be mean.

179
00:16:09,972 --> 00:16:11,472
I'm smart.

180
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:18,280
Okay, you can help
with the bait sets,

181
00:16:18,314 --> 00:16:20,050
but we find any fresh tracks,
you take the same path home.

182
00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:21,083
No questions.

183
00:16:23,086 --> 00:16:24,321
Tova stays here.

184
00:16:24,421 --> 00:16:26,057
Go grab your rifle.

185
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,860
Jo, are you there?

186
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,696
I'm here, go.

187
00:17:01,796 --> 00:17:03,430
Renee is with you?

188
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:04,431
She's here.

189
00:17:04,465 --> 00:17:05,700
She's just baiting sets.

190
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,836
I'll send her back when
it turns into a hunt.

191
00:17:09,303 --> 00:17:10,672
You sure that's safe?

192
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:12,842
We're moving up wind.

193
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,777
She follows the same path
back, she'll be fine.

194
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:15,845
She's got the 22.

195
00:17:18,313 --> 00:17:20,315
Don't make that face.

196
00:17:20,348 --> 00:17:21,484
I know what I'm doing.

197
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:23,687
We should stay off the walkie.

198
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,957
Buddy trip is so loud, it'll
hear us from a mile away.

199
00:17:29,993 --> 00:17:31,194
Over and out.

200
00:17:37,068 --> 00:17:38,335
Think it's wolf shit.

201
00:17:39,671 --> 00:17:40,639
Come here.

202
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:48,047
I want you to rub this
all over your body.

203
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,180
Get it in deep.

204
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:51,851
Look at me.

205
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,587
You wanna snag a wolf,
you gotta out wolf them.

206
00:17:57,857 --> 00:18:00,761
That careful son of a bitch is
always looking for traps so.

207
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:06,167
We gotta be careful, too.

208
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:09,037
That's for your breath.

209
00:18:12,206 --> 00:18:13,574
Yeah.

210
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:15,043
Come on, let's go.

211
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:23,019
Without its pack, a lone wolf
won't go for its usual prey.

212
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:28,058
It'll go for the old, the
young, the sick, dead.

213
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:30,293
Gotta give him some
of what he wants.

214
00:18:32,796 --> 00:18:36,066
When you're backing up, don't
lean heavy on your footsteps.

215
00:18:37,234 --> 00:18:39,369
Watch how you don't break.

216
00:18:42,272 --> 00:18:43,407
What is it?

217
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:53,251
Is it him?

218
00:18:56,489 --> 00:18:58,158
Go on home.

219
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,727
Keep your rifle close.

220
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:02,428
Stay to the path.

221
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,834
If you see anything, you
hear anything, don't run.

222
00:19:07,668 --> 00:19:09,269
Pop a shot off.

223
00:19:09,302 --> 00:19:11,806
Whatever it is,
it'll keep on going.

224
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,607
What do you do if
you see something?

225
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:15,911
Don't run.

226
00:19:15,944 --> 00:19:17,980
All right, yeah.

227
00:19:19,948 --> 00:19:22,416
Tell mom I'll be home
after dark, okay?

228
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,786
Go on.

229
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:53,785
Pew pew.

230
00:26:42,003 --> 00:26:43,337
Hello.

231
00:26:46,608 --> 00:26:47,943
Hello.

232
00:27:00,857 --> 00:27:01,858
Hey.

233
00:28:29,254 --> 00:28:32,258
What's
wrong with the food?

234
00:28:34,594 --> 00:28:36,229
Ate on the line.

235
00:28:49,744 --> 00:28:51,579
Renee says she
heard a gunshot.

236
00:28:54,582 --> 00:28:55,950
Thought I heard something.

237
00:28:59,755 --> 00:29:00,757
And?

238
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,928
I was wrong.

239
00:29:07,096 --> 00:29:09,833
Deep in the forest
a call was sounding

240
00:29:09,932 --> 00:29:12,436
and as often as he
heard this call,

241
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:16,106
mysteriously grilling
and learning,

242
00:29:16,139 --> 00:29:19,342
he felt compelled to turn
his back upon the fire

243
00:29:19,443 --> 00:29:21,245
and the beaming earth around it

244
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,648
and to plunge into the forest

245
00:29:23,681 --> 00:29:27,018
and on and on he
knew not where or why

246
00:29:27,118 --> 00:29:30,088
and what did he
tender where or why.

247
00:29:30,122 --> 00:29:31,523
The call sounding.

248
00:29:34,694 --> 00:29:35,795
Imperiously.

249
00:29:36,628 --> 00:29:39,499
The call sounding imperiously.

250
00:30:20,177 --> 00:30:21,813
He just needs to
show himself once

251
00:30:21,846 --> 00:30:23,748
and it'll all be over.

252
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,851
I know.

253
00:30:28,586 --> 00:30:29,922
Tomorrow.

254
00:30:32,423 --> 00:30:33,691
Tomorrow.

255
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,253
Are you there?

256
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,428
Are you there?

257
00:31:44,771 --> 00:31:46,138
Jo, are you there?

258
00:32:00,153 --> 00:32:01,488
I'm here.

259
00:32:04,994 --> 00:32:06,127
Any sign yet?

260
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:11,666
No.

261
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,873
I'm gonna stay out all night
if that's what it takes.

262
00:32:18,307 --> 00:32:19,642
Might be out of range so.

263
00:32:21,845 --> 00:32:23,179
Check in tomorrow.

264
00:32:27,517 --> 00:32:30,021
Promise you'll let
me know when you get it.

265
00:32:34,726 --> 00:32:35,827
Soon as I know.

266
00:32:38,864 --> 00:32:41,333
In the meantime, don't veer
too far from the cabin.

267
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,004
You go anywhere, you
take your 22, okay?

268
00:32:46,906 --> 00:32:47,907
I thought you said

269
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,541
there was nothing
to worry about.

270
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:57,918
Just to be safe.

271
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,419
Over and out.

272
00:33:46,939 --> 00:33:48,607
Mom, I got five.

273
00:33:49,976 --> 00:33:52,045
That's just two off
your dad's record.

274
00:33:52,078 --> 00:33:53,780
Pretty soon you'll
even beat that.

275
00:33:53,813 --> 00:33:55,314
Yeah, I'll never beat him.

276
00:33:56,482 --> 00:33:58,551
Doesn't even need flat ones.

277
00:33:58,585 --> 00:34:00,420
He can skip any shape.

278
00:34:03,758 --> 00:34:05,291
Mom, where's Tova?

279
00:34:05,325 --> 00:34:06,426
He can't have gone far.

280
00:34:06,459 --> 00:34:07,595
He was just beside me.

281
00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:11,432
Tova.

282
00:34:15,336 --> 00:34:16,437
Tova.

283
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:28,018
Renee, get behind me.

284
00:35:00,854 --> 00:35:02,956
Mom, Tova's
still out there.

285
00:35:02,989 --> 00:35:05,293
He's still out
there with the wolf.

286
00:35:05,325 --> 00:35:06,994
Please, we gotta go back.

287
00:35:07,028 --> 00:35:07,995
Okay, okay.

288
00:35:08,029 --> 00:35:09,197
Okay, okay, okay.

289
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,497
I'm gonna go look
for Tova, okay?

290
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:11,833
I'm gonna go look.

291
00:35:11,866 --> 00:35:13,667
Go get the 22 shells.

292
00:35:26,348 --> 00:35:27,317
Tova.

293
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:28,318
Tova.

294
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,319
Inside.

295
00:35:29,351 --> 00:35:30,320
Shut the door.

296
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:43,433
Tova.

297
00:35:51,076 --> 00:35:52,409
Tova.

298
00:35:57,216 --> 00:35:58,184
Tova, come.

299
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,999
I'm worried about Tova.

300
00:37:12,032 --> 00:37:14,168
He knows how to
take care of himself.

301
00:37:14,201 --> 00:37:15,468
Not against a wolf.

302
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,306
Dad said wolves hate dogs.

303
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:24,379
We'll go out again tomorrow
when your dad gets home.

304
00:37:26,181 --> 00:37:27,481
I'm worried about Dad, too.

305
00:37:29,151 --> 00:37:31,053
Renee, there's
nothing to worry about.

306
00:37:31,153 --> 00:37:32,121
He's fine.

307
00:37:32,154 --> 00:37:33,289
How do you know?

308
00:37:33,322 --> 00:37:35,958
'Cause I know your dad.

309
00:37:35,992 --> 00:37:38,227
I know he's stronger than
any animal in this forest.

310
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:42,165
He's not afraid of a wolf
and neither are we, right?

311
00:37:45,168 --> 00:37:46,203
Right.

312
00:37:47,037 --> 00:37:49,307
Goodnight, sweetheart.

313
00:37:53,044 --> 00:37:55,545
I hope he gets him
while we're sleeping.

314
00:38:22,376 --> 00:38:23,543
Jo.

315
00:38:28,716 --> 00:38:30,218
Joseph, are you there?

316
00:38:43,933 --> 00:38:46,270
One, two.

317
00:38:46,736 --> 00:38:47,737
Three.

318
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:49,106
Five.

319
00:38:49,807 --> 00:38:51,141
Seven.

320
00:38:51,442 --> 00:38:52,776
11.

321
00:38:53,477 --> 00:38:54,778
17.

322
00:38:54,812 --> 00:38:56,081
13.

323
00:38:56,114 --> 00:38:57,415
13.

324
00:38:57,449 --> 00:38:58,783
17.

325
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:01,086
19.

326
00:39:05,424 --> 00:39:07,326
We need to find more food.

327
00:39:15,001 --> 00:39:16,136
Hey, not that way.

328
00:39:17,437 --> 00:39:19,806
We'll check the Highland line.

329
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,808
The closest traps
are by the river.

330
00:39:21,842 --> 00:39:24,078
Your dad can check those
ones when he gets back.

331
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,248
Come on.

332
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:53,777
What's wrong?

333
00:40:17,403 --> 00:40:18,804
It's wolf.

334
00:40:29,516 --> 00:40:31,084
What is that?

335
00:40:33,855 --> 00:40:35,523
It's a ring.

336
00:40:37,258 --> 00:40:39,527
The wolf ate a ring?

337
00:40:43,265 --> 00:40:44,934
I guess it did.

338
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,671
But where
would it get it from?

339
00:40:52,275 --> 00:40:54,344
We're going for a
ride in the truck.

340
00:41:17,803 --> 00:41:19,472
Hold on, hold on.

341
00:41:20,406 --> 00:41:21,740
Yes.

342
00:41:22,475 --> 00:41:24,477
Yes, I'm listening.

343
00:41:25,411 --> 00:41:26,713
Ma'am.

344
00:41:26,745 --> 00:41:28,983
Ma'am, I can help you but
you're gonna have to calm down.

345
00:41:29,817 --> 00:41:31,085
Yes, I am.

346
00:41:32,586 --> 00:41:33,921
Yes.

347
00:41:35,755 --> 00:41:37,324
Please.

348
00:41:37,424 --> 00:41:39,461
Ma'am, we can send someone
as soon as I have an address.

349
00:41:40,996 --> 00:41:42,330
Okay.

350
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:44,399
Great.

351
00:41:44,432 --> 00:41:46,968
We're gonna have someone right.

352
00:41:48,604 --> 00:41:50,006
Nice.

353
00:41:50,106 --> 00:41:51,140
Who's turn?

354
00:41:51,173 --> 00:41:52,275
I did the last one.

355
00:41:53,175 --> 00:41:54,844
We'll flip for it.

356
00:41:54,944 --> 00:41:56,946
We can flip when it's my turn.

357
00:41:56,979 --> 00:41:58,315
86 Wilton.

358
00:41:58,348 --> 00:41:59,316
I'd get going.

359
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:00,784
She didn't sound like
the most patient type.

360
00:42:04,454 --> 00:42:06,356
Make sure you bring
the sat phone.

361
00:42:06,456 --> 00:42:08,026
The coverage up there stinks.

362
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:10,461
Kind of like that lunch
that you just brought in.

363
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,965
Have fun.

364
00:42:22,808 --> 00:42:24,043
Oh my God.

365
00:42:24,143 --> 00:42:26,278
I'm literally staring at
a dead bear right now.

366
00:42:26,313 --> 00:42:29,449
It was a lot bigger when
it was walking around.

367
00:42:29,482 --> 00:42:30,950
And it smells like.

368
00:42:30,984 --> 00:42:32,352
Like.

369
00:42:32,385 --> 00:42:33,620
Dead bear?

370
00:42:33,653 --> 00:42:34,954
The damn thing
is worthless, Greg.

371
00:42:34,988 --> 00:42:37,291
It's the reception,
not the phone, hon.

372
00:42:37,325 --> 00:42:38,459
Just use the landline inside.

373
00:42:38,492 --> 00:42:39,795
Swear to God don't
start with me right now.

374
00:42:39,827 --> 00:42:40,796
My hands are still shaking.

375
00:42:40,828 --> 00:42:41,862
Is that a ticket?

376
00:42:41,896 --> 00:42:42,863
You are
required by law-

377
00:42:42,897 --> 00:42:44,131
- Are you writing me a ticking?

378
00:42:44,165 --> 00:42:45,132
To have locks on
your garbage cans.

379
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:46,134
No, no, no, no, no, no.

380
00:42:46,168 --> 00:42:47,135
A ticket for what?

381
00:42:47,169 --> 00:42:48,337
$500?

382
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:50,472
Do you know what
habituated means?

383
00:42:50,505 --> 00:42:53,475
It's when an animal loses its
natural aversion to humans.

384
00:42:53,508 --> 00:42:55,078
Bad for animals.

385
00:42:55,178 --> 00:42:56,479
Bad for humans.

386
00:42:56,512 --> 00:42:58,014
Get some proper trash cans.

387
00:43:00,016 --> 00:43:01,584
Hey, hey.

388
00:43:01,684 --> 00:43:02,719
Thanks for stopping by, huh?

389
00:43:02,752 --> 00:43:04,420
Fuck off.

390
00:43:08,225 --> 00:43:09,828
Thanks for stopping by.

391
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:12,996
Babe, tell him about the dogs.

392
00:43:54,276 --> 00:43:55,944
I don't think I'm
understanding this right.

393
00:43:55,978 --> 00:43:57,579
Which part?

394
00:43:57,613 --> 00:43:58,882
The living
out in the woods part.

395
00:43:58,914 --> 00:44:00,549
You said that's your
permanent address?

396
00:44:00,582 --> 00:44:01,617
In the summer and fall.

397
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:03,420
We have a winter
cabin 60 miles north.

398
00:44:06,756 --> 00:44:09,159
So your husband
goes hunting yesterday

399
00:44:09,259 --> 00:44:10,593
and you haven't
heard back from him.

400
00:44:10,627 --> 00:44:11,996
Has he ever been gone this long?

401
00:44:12,096 --> 00:44:13,764
He's always in radio contact.

402
00:44:13,799 --> 00:44:16,100
36 hours isn't
that long for a hunt.

403
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:18,502
We lose radio contact
out there all the time.

404
00:44:18,602 --> 00:44:20,271
Are you even allowed
to be living out there?

405
00:44:20,304 --> 00:44:21,573
That's all federal land.

406
00:44:21,606 --> 00:44:22,774
It's my husband's land.

407
00:44:22,809 --> 00:44:25,277
It's been in his family
for three generations.

408
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:27,612
Well, not according to
the line management act.

409
00:44:28,613 --> 00:44:29,916
What does that mean?

410
00:44:29,948 --> 00:44:31,517
It means it's out
of our jurisdiction.

411
00:44:31,617 --> 00:44:33,486
This isn't a federal office.

412
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:36,522
It also means if we file
a missing persons report,

413
00:44:36,622 --> 00:44:38,524
it's gonna be questions about
your living arrangements.

414
00:44:38,624 --> 00:44:40,493
You know with your
little boy out there,

415
00:44:40,526 --> 00:44:42,463
is that something you
want to do right now?

416
00:44:43,664 --> 00:44:44,799
What about the wolf?

417
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,334
If it happened near
town, it'd be different,

418
00:44:47,367 --> 00:44:50,538
but you can't really blame
a wolf for being a wolf,

419
00:44:50,638 --> 00:44:53,308
especially if he's doing
it where he's supposed to.

420
00:44:53,341 --> 00:44:55,610
Technically, he has more claim
to that area than she does.

421
00:44:55,643 --> 00:44:57,712
This isn't a normal wolf.

422
00:44:57,813 --> 00:45:00,449
I stood face to face with
it as close as we are now.

423
00:45:00,483 --> 00:45:02,618
Was it foaming, rabid?

424
00:45:02,651 --> 00:45:03,619
It wasn't rabid.

425
00:45:03,652 --> 00:45:04,987
It was.

426
00:45:08,324 --> 00:45:09,993
Mean.

427
00:45:11,829 --> 00:45:12,897
Mean wolf.

428
00:45:12,996 --> 00:45:13,965
You don't believe me.

429
00:45:13,997 --> 00:45:14,966
It's not that.

430
00:45:14,998 --> 00:45:16,333
It's just.

431
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:18,870
Like she said, we're
a municipal office.

432
00:45:18,903 --> 00:45:20,505
So there's nothing you'll do.

433
00:45:20,538 --> 00:45:21,506
What's to be done?

434
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:23,040
Wolves are native to the area.

435
00:45:23,074 --> 00:45:24,008
My advice is to wait
for your husband

436
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:25,309
to get back from his hunting

437
00:45:25,343 --> 00:45:26,979
and then move your
family out of the woods.

438
00:45:27,011 --> 00:45:28,513
Thank you for your time.

439
00:45:28,547 --> 00:45:29,916
Hey look, I don't wanna
be the bad guy here.

440
00:45:30,015 --> 00:45:31,350
I just.

441
00:45:32,017 --> 00:45:33,652
I don't know what
we can do for you.

442
00:45:37,389 --> 00:45:38,926
Do you have any food?

443
00:45:55,709 --> 00:45:56,878
Come on.

444
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:08,691
Go on inside,
start your lessons.

445
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:09,725
I'll be right back.

446
00:46:09,759 --> 00:46:10,726
Where are you going?

447
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,727
Just to look around.

448
00:46:11,761 --> 00:46:12,896
I won't be long.

449
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:36,187
It's just a baby.

450
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:37,522
I know.

451
00:47:38,223 --> 00:47:39,691
Not supposed to
shoot the babies.

452
00:47:39,724 --> 00:47:40,826
It was an accident.

453
00:47:41,827 --> 00:47:42,863
I thought it was.

454
00:47:45,498 --> 00:47:47,901
Anyway, no sense in letting
good meat go to waste.

455
00:47:48,001 --> 00:47:49,368
We're gonna eat it?

456
00:47:49,402 --> 00:47:50,837
We have to eat something.

457
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,009
I've never had to
skin a deer before,

458
00:47:55,043 --> 00:47:57,177
but you watch your dad
do it all the time.

459
00:47:58,913 --> 00:48:01,049
Do you think you
could show me how?

460
00:48:07,422 --> 00:48:08,723
Now hold these tight.

461
00:48:08,756 --> 00:48:09,892
Okay.

462
00:48:09,925 --> 00:48:11,828
And then you start
to cut through the skin

463
00:48:11,861 --> 00:48:15,664
by the back leg down to the
ribs, but don't cut too deep

464
00:48:15,698 --> 00:48:18,500
because then you'll
puncture the stomach.

465
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:25,375
Okay, stop.

466
00:48:26,276 --> 00:48:29,713
And then you reach
all the way inside.

467
00:48:30,882 --> 00:48:31,883
And pull.

468
00:48:37,055 --> 00:48:39,557
Okay and then to skin
it, you take this corner

469
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:43,196
and pull down really hard,
but you have to cut as you go.

470
00:49:02,917 --> 00:49:03,885
Eat.

471
00:49:03,918 --> 00:49:05,252
You eat deer all the time.

472
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,890
I can't stop
thinking about it.

473
00:49:08,923 --> 00:49:10,425
My brain just knows it's a baby.

474
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:11,426
It's not a baby.

475
00:49:11,459 --> 00:49:12,427
It's food.

476
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:13,428
It's meat.

477
00:49:13,461 --> 00:49:14,796
Please eat.

478
00:49:55,175 --> 00:49:56,843
Joe, are you there?

479
00:50:01,648 --> 00:50:03,050
Joseph, can you hear me?

480
00:50:08,156 --> 00:50:09,825
Joe, come in.

481
00:50:10,826 --> 00:50:11,860
Joseph.

482
00:50:34,852 --> 00:50:36,520
Mom, wake up.

483
00:50:36,553 --> 00:50:38,022
Mom, wake up.

484
00:50:38,056 --> 00:50:39,023
Tova's back.

485
00:50:39,057 --> 00:50:40,024
- He's outside.
- What?

486
00:50:40,058 --> 00:50:41,025
Come on, I know it's him.

487
00:50:41,059 --> 00:50:42,026
I heard him howling.

488
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,027
- Sweetheart, no.
- No please, it's Tova.

489
00:50:43,061 --> 00:50:44,028
I know it is.

490
00:50:44,062 --> 00:50:45,029
Come on, Mom.

491
00:50:45,064 --> 00:50:46,031
Come on.

492
00:50:58,544 --> 00:51:00,046
I can't hear anything.

493
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,047
I heard him.

494
00:51:01,081 --> 00:51:02,414
I know I did.

495
00:51:02,715 --> 00:51:05,019
It's not Tova.

496
00:51:05,052 --> 00:51:06,419
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

497
00:51:06,453 --> 00:51:07,420
There's nothing out here.

498
00:51:07,454 --> 00:51:08,421
You were having a dream.

499
00:51:08,455 --> 00:51:09,589
I wasn't having a dream.

500
00:51:09,623 --> 00:51:10,624
I heard it.

501
00:51:10,724 --> 00:51:11,859
It sounded like he was hurt.

502
00:51:11,893 --> 00:51:12,860
Please, Mom.

503
00:51:12,894 --> 00:51:13,862
Renee, please.

504
00:51:16,899 --> 00:51:17,866
There, you heard it right?

505
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:18,867
Sh.

506
00:51:21,469 --> 00:51:22,803
Joe.

507
00:51:23,238 --> 00:51:24,908
That wasn't Tova.

508
00:51:25,241 --> 00:51:26,209
Stay inside.

509
00:51:26,242 --> 00:51:27,377
I'll be right back.

510
00:51:27,409 --> 00:51:28,543
- I'll be right back.
- Mom, it wasn't the wolf.

511
00:51:28,577 --> 00:51:29,544
Joe.

512
00:51:33,918 --> 00:51:34,952
Joseph.

513
00:51:38,788 --> 00:51:40,490
Joe, where are you?

514
00:51:42,961 --> 00:51:44,129
Here.

515
00:51:47,165 --> 00:51:48,133
Here.

516
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:04,017
What was it?

517
00:52:04,117 --> 00:52:05,118
Come on.

518
00:52:06,019 --> 00:52:07,486
Stay in this room
until I come get you.

519
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,754
Do you understand?

520
00:52:08,788 --> 00:52:09,789
Say you understand.

521
00:52:09,822 --> 00:52:10,823
I understand.

522
00:55:51,034 --> 00:55:52,036
Mom.

523
00:55:52,069 --> 00:55:53,070
Mom.

524
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:54,338
Water.

525
00:55:54,371 --> 00:55:56,040
He's awake.

526
00:56:00,544 --> 00:56:02,547
Water.

527
00:56:03,215 --> 00:56:04,883
Please.

528
00:56:23,736 --> 00:56:26,039
It's okay, come on.

529
00:56:26,073 --> 00:56:27,474
Come sit.

530
00:56:37,485 --> 00:56:38,819
Who is he?

531
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,589
I found him in the
woods last night.

532
00:56:40,623 --> 00:56:41,924
He has no identification.

533
00:56:42,757 --> 00:56:44,093
What identification?

534
00:56:46,462 --> 00:56:49,298
People from the city carry
cards that say who they are.

535
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:58,475
He doesn't have one?

536
00:56:58,508 --> 00:57:01,746
No.

537
00:57:01,778 --> 00:57:02,980
What happened to him?

538
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,449
His leg is hurt.

539
00:57:07,184 --> 00:57:09,187
Did the wolf bite him?

540
00:57:09,955 --> 00:57:11,957
Looks like it.

541
00:57:13,158 --> 00:57:15,160
He's a stranger.

542
00:57:15,527 --> 00:57:16,762
Dad said we're not supposed
to trust strangers.

543
00:57:16,794 --> 00:57:17,795
It doesn't matter
what dad says.

544
00:57:17,828 --> 00:57:18,931
Dad's not here.

545
00:57:18,965 --> 00:57:20,633
And we can't just.

546
00:57:25,305 --> 00:57:27,173
We're helping him because
that's what you do

547
00:57:27,206 --> 00:57:29,376
when you find someone
who needs help.

548
00:57:29,476 --> 00:57:31,945
If your dad was here,
he'd say the same thing.

549
00:58:20,366 --> 00:58:21,700
You are not
gonna believe this.

550
00:58:21,734 --> 00:58:22,768
What?

551
00:58:22,867 --> 00:58:24,236
Another bear call.

552
00:58:24,269 --> 00:58:25,705
Seriously?

553
00:58:25,739 --> 00:58:27,073
Where?

554
00:58:28,041 --> 00:58:29,008
No.

555
00:58:29,042 --> 00:58:30,009
Yep.

556
00:58:30,043 --> 00:58:31,010
Again?

557
00:58:31,044 --> 00:58:32,045
Yep.

558
00:58:32,078 --> 00:58:36,217
Damn yuppies think
the laws do not apply

559
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:37,418
until they need 'em.

560
00:58:39,086 --> 00:58:40,287
Still wanna
flip that coin?

561
00:58:40,388 --> 00:58:41,922
No, I'll go.

562
00:58:41,956 --> 00:58:44,726
I got a skunk up at 21 so
I gotta hit the dump again.

563
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:45,727
Oh, thank God.

564
00:58:45,761 --> 00:58:47,429
I thought that was your lunch.

565
00:58:47,796 --> 00:58:49,931
I'm gonna tell
Barb you said that.

566
00:58:49,965 --> 00:58:51,233
See you later.

567
00:58:51,266 --> 00:58:52,901
You're forgetting something.

568
00:58:54,136 --> 00:58:55,104
Yeah.

569
00:58:55,138 --> 00:58:56,806
Sat phone.

570
00:58:58,808 --> 00:58:59,776
See ya.

571
00:58:59,809 --> 00:59:01,077
See ya.

572
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,217
That bear's long gone.

573
00:59:07,251 --> 00:59:08,318
What?

574
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:09,486
It couldn't have gone far.

575
00:59:09,586 --> 00:59:10,554
It's off your property
and on private land.

576
00:59:10,587 --> 00:59:11,555
What are we supposed to do?

577
00:59:11,588 --> 00:59:12,556
Hey, hey, hey.

578
00:59:12,589 --> 00:59:13,558
That was the
mother or the father.

579
00:59:46,961 --> 00:59:48,296
Hello.

580
01:00:07,217 --> 01:00:08,551
Hello.

581
01:00:13,657 --> 01:00:14,992
Hello.

582
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,567
Where am I?

583
01:00:53,201 --> 01:00:54,869
This is our home.

584
01:00:55,403 --> 01:00:56,604
I brought you here last night.

585
01:00:56,704 --> 01:00:57,872
I'll get you some water.

586
01:01:01,877 --> 01:01:02,845
I don't remember.

587
01:01:02,878 --> 01:01:03,846
Wait, don't move your leg.

588
01:01:05,548 --> 01:01:06,549
Just.

589
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:08,552
Take it easy.

590
01:01:09,452 --> 01:01:10,787
Here.

591
01:01:11,388 --> 01:01:13,456
You don't remember last night?

592
01:01:13,557 --> 01:01:14,558
No.

593
01:01:14,591 --> 01:01:15,927
No.

594
01:01:18,629 --> 01:01:20,097
I was attacked.

595
01:01:20,131 --> 01:01:21,232
There's a wolf.

596
01:01:21,265 --> 01:01:22,700
It's been stalking us.

597
01:01:22,733 --> 01:01:24,468
Almost attacked us two days ago.

598
01:01:25,736 --> 01:01:27,238
Something must
have scared it off

599
01:01:27,271 --> 01:01:28,473
before it could finish you.

600
01:01:28,574 --> 01:01:29,775
Hopefully it was my husband.

601
01:01:31,076 --> 01:01:32,711
Your husband.

602
01:01:32,744 --> 01:01:34,413
Joseph.

603
01:01:34,446 --> 01:01:35,480
My name is Anne.

604
01:01:36,782 --> 01:01:38,718
That's our daughter Renee.

605
01:01:38,751 --> 01:01:40,086
Lou.

606
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:41,654
Nice to meet you, Anne.

607
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:46,326
Thinking maybe
you saved my life.

608
01:01:46,426 --> 01:01:47,428
Thank you.

609
01:01:55,102 --> 01:01:57,405
I must've been
freezing out there.

610
01:01:57,439 --> 01:01:59,441
I'm surprised I didn't
catch hypothermia.

611
01:02:00,977 --> 01:02:02,444
What brought you out here?

612
01:02:04,947 --> 01:02:06,449
What do you mean?

613
01:02:06,482 --> 01:02:08,150
Well this.

614
01:02:08,784 --> 01:02:10,519
We don't get a lot
of people out here.

615
01:02:12,288 --> 01:02:13,656
Well no, of course not.

616
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:16,460
That's what makes it so special.

617
01:02:18,029 --> 01:02:19,696
I'm a photographer.

618
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:21,632
I was headed up to the falls.

619
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,371
My car broke down.

620
01:02:28,306 --> 01:02:29,507
Started walking back.

621
01:02:30,508 --> 01:02:31,542
I was.

622
01:02:32,644 --> 01:02:34,345
I was so dumb.

623
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:35,547
I don't know what
I was thinking.

624
01:02:37,383 --> 01:02:38,717
It got dark fast.

625
01:02:38,817 --> 01:02:39,852
Cold, too.

626
01:02:41,654 --> 01:02:43,322
I heard a sound.

627
01:02:45,492 --> 01:02:46,693
I heard a sound.

628
01:02:47,861 --> 01:02:49,162
I thought that was help.

629
01:02:51,065 --> 01:02:52,033
Maybe it was a wolf.

630
01:02:52,066 --> 01:02:53,733
I don't know.

631
01:02:54,835 --> 01:02:55,803
That's the last
thing I remember.

632
01:02:55,836 --> 01:02:57,405
I must've blacked out.

633
01:02:59,173 --> 01:03:00,708
This is where we are.

634
01:03:00,741 --> 01:03:02,144
The road is up here.

635
01:03:02,176 --> 01:03:04,579
And we got a truck
parked there abouts.

636
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,215
If we can make it there,
we can get you to help.

637
01:03:07,249 --> 01:03:09,651
Wait, you wanna go outside?

638
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:11,520
What if it's still out there?

639
01:03:11,553 --> 01:03:13,189
You need a hospital.

640
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:14,424
Those wounds will get infected

641
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:15,491
and you're gonna
be in a lot of pain

642
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:17,027
when that shot I
gave you wears off.

643
01:03:17,061 --> 01:03:18,028
Right.

644
01:03:18,062 --> 01:03:19,029
Right, right.

645
01:03:19,063 --> 01:03:20,496
I just.

646
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:24,002
This thing attacked
you too, right?

647
01:03:24,035 --> 01:03:25,703
I'd be like a sitting
duck out there.

648
01:03:26,037 --> 01:03:27,005
Look at me.

649
01:03:27,038 --> 01:03:28,006
I can't fight back.

650
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:30,041
I mean, I can barely
sit up straight.

651
01:03:35,714 --> 01:03:36,681
Come.

652
01:03:36,715 --> 01:03:38,349
I need your help.

653
01:03:44,724 --> 01:03:45,791
This doesn't feel right.

654
01:03:48,227 --> 01:03:49,196
Oh.

655
01:03:49,228 --> 01:03:50,197
No.

656
01:03:50,229 --> 01:03:51,297
I'm not getting on that thing.

657
01:03:51,397 --> 01:03:53,201
It's the only way to
get you to the road.

658
01:03:53,233 --> 01:03:54,202
Look at it.

659
01:03:54,234 --> 01:03:55,203
It's way too small.

660
01:03:55,235 --> 01:03:57,205
I'm gonna be hanging off of it.

661
01:03:57,237 --> 01:03:58,371
These aren't meant for people.

662
01:03:58,405 --> 01:04:00,240
This is how I got you here.

663
01:04:00,273 --> 01:04:01,275
Get the door, Renee.

664
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:05,379
I don't think
I'm ready for this.

665
01:04:05,413 --> 01:04:06,647
Okay, come
on, help me with this.

666
01:04:09,584 --> 01:04:11,453
Taking him all
the way to the road?

667
01:04:11,487 --> 01:04:13,288
I won't be strong enough
so you're gonna have to help.

668
01:04:13,322 --> 01:04:14,289
Okay?

669
01:04:14,323 --> 01:04:15,290
Get behind and push.

670
01:04:15,324 --> 01:04:16,291
It's really hurting me.

671
01:04:16,325 --> 01:04:17,292
I'm sorry.

672
01:04:17,326 --> 01:04:18,293
It's the only way
to get you there.

673
01:04:18,327 --> 01:04:19,795
This is never gonna work.

674
01:04:19,828 --> 01:04:20,797
I'm telling you.

675
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:21,798
It's just not gonna work.

676
01:04:21,831 --> 01:04:22,799
You ready, Renee?

677
01:04:22,832 --> 01:04:24,068
Three, two, one.

678
01:04:24,101 --> 01:04:25,069
Push.

679
01:04:25,102 --> 01:04:26,170
It's slippery.

680
01:04:26,269 --> 01:04:27,303
Just dig
your heels in, Renee.

681
01:04:27,337 --> 01:04:29,006
Please stop.

682
01:04:29,106 --> 01:04:30,741
Mom, he wants us to stop.

683
01:04:30,775 --> 01:04:31,742
It's hurting him.

684
01:04:31,776 --> 01:04:32,743
It's okay.

685
01:04:32,777 --> 01:04:33,744
Keep going.

686
01:04:33,778 --> 01:04:34,745
Please.

687
01:04:34,779 --> 01:04:35,746
For the love of
God, please stop.

688
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:36,747
The wolf's gonna hear him.

689
01:04:36,781 --> 01:04:38,415
- He's too loud.
- Please stop.

690
01:04:38,449 --> 01:04:39,584
The wolf's gonna hear him.

691
01:04:39,618 --> 01:04:41,286
He's too loud.

692
01:04:41,853 --> 01:04:43,156
I'm sorry.

693
01:04:43,189 --> 01:04:44,289
I can't.

694
01:04:44,322 --> 01:04:45,290
I just can't.

695
01:04:45,323 --> 01:04:47,126
It hurts too much.

696
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,428
I'm sorry.

697
01:04:49,462 --> 01:04:50,663
I don't wanna go out there.

698
01:04:54,634 --> 01:04:56,502
Just put me on the floor.

699
01:04:56,536 --> 01:04:57,503
Not the floor.

700
01:04:57,537 --> 01:04:58,504
We'll take him to my room.

701
01:04:58,538 --> 01:05:00,008
Grab the bedding, Renee.

702
01:05:00,041 --> 01:05:01,009
Sorry.

703
01:05:01,042 --> 01:05:02,309
I'm so sorry for all this.

704
01:05:03,477 --> 01:05:04,946
Ah, thank you.

705
01:05:04,979 --> 01:05:07,548
Thank you, thank you.

706
01:05:07,648 --> 01:05:09,717
I just need some time.

707
01:05:09,818 --> 01:05:11,519
Things will be easier
when my husband gets back.

708
01:05:11,553 --> 01:05:12,887
I promise.

709
01:05:13,655 --> 01:05:14,656
You'll be okay.

710
01:05:15,657 --> 01:05:16,658
We'll all be okay.

711
01:05:17,826 --> 01:05:19,129
Get some rest.

712
01:05:31,242 --> 01:05:34,245
Gather up the reworking trap
and see what you can find.

713
01:05:34,344 --> 01:05:36,746
Any kind of weapons.

714
01:05:36,847 --> 01:05:38,850
We need to start
thinking like your dad.

715
01:05:42,687 --> 01:05:44,189
That's all the
traps we've got.

716
01:05:46,758 --> 01:05:48,493
Not enough.

717
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:50,562
This is the way my
granddad used to do it.

718
01:05:50,596 --> 01:05:51,697
He was a hunter, too.

719
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:54,867
The wolf tries to eat the meat,

720
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:58,605
but he licks the blade
and taste his own blood.

721
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,676
So he keeps licking and licking

722
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,112
and licking and
licking and licking.

723
01:06:06,914 --> 01:06:08,849
Dad says we don't use poison.

724
01:06:08,883 --> 01:06:11,019
Well if he were,
we wouldn't have to.

725
01:06:11,052 --> 01:06:12,087
We need to protect ourselves.

726
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,355
If we don't hurt the wolf,

727
01:06:13,387 --> 01:06:15,624
the wolf is gonna keep
trying to hurt us.

728
01:06:15,724 --> 01:06:18,361
And what is Tova comes
back and eats it instead?

729
01:06:21,796 --> 01:06:22,797
He won't.

730
01:06:26,469 --> 01:06:27,703
I'm all out.

731
01:06:32,909 --> 01:06:35,280
What else did your dad
teach you about wolves?

732
01:06:36,914 --> 01:06:38,415
They hate smoke and fire.

733
01:06:41,252 --> 01:06:44,088
Then we'll
have smoke and fire.

734
01:06:55,268 --> 01:06:58,671
Orion hotel foxtrot
two four eight.

735
01:07:01,807 --> 01:07:02,775
That's right.

736
01:07:02,808 --> 01:07:04,145
K car.

737
01:07:05,779 --> 01:07:06,746
Probably two days.

738
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:08,282
Maybe more.

739
01:07:10,284 --> 01:07:11,319
All right, no problem.

740
01:07:12,286 --> 01:07:13,821
Thanks.

741
01:07:13,854 --> 01:07:15,523
You too.

742
01:07:22,331 --> 01:07:23,299
Please
don't take that out

743
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:24,866
until I'm done with this.

744
01:07:26,302 --> 01:07:27,469
What did she say
she found this?

745
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:29,205
I don't remember.

746
01:07:29,305 --> 01:07:31,374
It must be sector six or seven

747
01:07:31,473 --> 01:07:33,177
if it's only 20 minutes
from the country.

748
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:34,711
Hair lakes.

749
01:07:36,479 --> 01:07:37,647
Uh oh.

750
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,949
I see the wheels turning.

751
01:07:38,983 --> 01:07:40,550
What does that mean?

752
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:43,487
Something about that lady.

753
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,823
If you ask me, the wolf is
the least of her problems.

754
01:07:45,856 --> 01:07:49,127
Can you imagine living out
there permanently with a kid?

755
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,527
That's just it.

756
01:07:50,561 --> 01:07:53,032
She's been living out
there for how long?

757
01:07:53,065 --> 01:07:55,700
She didn't seem like the
type that scared so easy.

758
01:07:57,003 --> 01:07:59,804
Where would a wolf find
a cheap old ring like that?

759
01:08:11,551 --> 01:08:14,721
Maybe it was attached to
something that tasted good.

760
01:08:14,755 --> 01:08:16,024
Like a finger?

761
01:08:19,093 --> 01:08:20,061
I'm heading out.

762
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,063
Out where?

763
01:08:21,096 --> 01:08:22,064
Check out the K car.

764
01:08:22,097 --> 01:08:23,531
What, we got like an hour left

765
01:08:23,564 --> 01:08:24,766
and you just called
in the plates.

766
01:08:24,866 --> 01:08:25,833
Why don't you wait
'til tomorrow?

767
01:08:25,867 --> 01:08:26,834
I'm curious.

768
01:08:26,868 --> 01:08:27,936
If I don't, it's going
to bug me all night.

769
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:33,410
Sat phone.

770
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:34,411
Nice.

771
01:10:17,657 --> 01:10:18,892
Lucy.

772
01:10:18,993 --> 01:10:20,327
Lucy.

773
01:10:20,827 --> 01:10:21,828
Do you copy?

774
01:10:23,531 --> 01:10:24,865
Lucy.

775
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,537
Jesus Christ.

776
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:29,803
Oh Jesus.

777
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:00,904
You there, Danny?

778
01:12:00,938 --> 01:12:03,108
Pick up the phone
if you're there.

779
01:12:03,141 --> 01:12:04,442
Come on, Danny.

780
01:12:04,476 --> 01:12:06,478
You better not have
fallen asleep there again.

781
01:12:06,511 --> 01:12:07,746
Wake up.

782
01:12:07,778 --> 01:12:08,912
Danny?

783
01:12:12,118 --> 01:12:13,519
Danny?

784
01:12:13,619 --> 01:12:14,853
Hey Luce, it's Barb.

785
01:12:14,953 --> 01:12:16,322
I fell asleep waiting
for Danny last night.

786
01:12:16,355 --> 01:12:17,856
He didn't come home.

787
01:12:17,957 --> 01:12:19,158
He didn't phone or anything.

788
01:12:19,191 --> 01:12:20,160
Danny.

789
01:12:20,193 --> 01:12:21,161
Can you give me
a call when you get in?

790
01:12:21,194 --> 01:12:22,162
Thanks.

791
01:14:48,523 --> 01:14:50,192
Joe, please answer me.

792
01:14:55,465 --> 01:14:56,432
Please help me.

793
01:14:56,466 --> 01:14:58,034
I can't do this alone.

794
01:15:08,979 --> 01:15:09,947
Joe.

795
01:15:14,152 --> 01:15:15,119
Joe.

796
01:15:17,489 --> 01:15:18,456
Joe.

797
01:15:23,329 --> 01:15:24,730
No.

798
01:15:24,830 --> 01:15:25,831
No.

799
01:16:23,762 --> 01:16:24,963
Danny.

800
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,136
Danny.

801
01:16:32,605 --> 01:16:33,573
Danny.

802
01:17:03,672 --> 01:17:04,640
Danny.

803
01:17:18,122 --> 01:17:19,091
Danny.

804
01:17:34,473 --> 01:17:35,807
Jesus.

805
01:17:36,676 --> 01:17:37,810
Danny.

806
01:17:37,844 --> 01:17:39,178
Oh my God.

807
01:17:39,212 --> 01:17:40,179
Oh my God, Danny.

808
01:17:40,213 --> 01:17:41,280
No.

809
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:45,518
Okay, listen to me.

810
01:17:45,551 --> 01:17:46,520
Listen to me.

811
01:17:46,553 --> 01:17:47,521
Tell Barb I love her.

812
01:17:47,554 --> 01:17:48,522
Listen to me.

813
01:17:48,555 --> 01:17:49,523
I am gonna go and
get help, okay?

814
01:17:49,556 --> 01:17:50,557
So you have to stay awake.

815
01:17:50,658 --> 01:17:51,625
Tell Barb-

816
01:17:51,659 --> 01:17:52,626
- You're gonna
tell her yourself.

817
01:20:05,306 --> 01:20:06,275
Renee.

818
01:20:11,214 --> 01:20:12,347
Renee.

819
01:20:30,534 --> 01:20:31,869
Mom.

820
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:33,704
Go.

821
01:20:33,737 --> 01:20:35,339
No, please.

822
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:36,574
Please, don't.

823
01:20:36,674 --> 01:20:37,675
Stop.

824
01:21:12,714 --> 01:21:13,681
Oh, man.

825
01:21:13,715 --> 01:21:14,782
That's the stuff.

826
01:21:16,751 --> 01:21:19,455
That is the stuff right there.

827
01:21:31,968 --> 01:21:33,304
Hey.

828
01:21:34,471 --> 01:21:37,408
I need the keys to your truck.

829
01:21:37,441 --> 01:21:40,312
I need to get to my car
before someone else finds it.

830
01:21:40,411 --> 01:21:41,913
Where are the keys?

831
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:44,283
Don't worry about her.

832
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:45,918
Your girl's fine.

833
01:21:45,951 --> 01:21:47,486
Tell me where the keys are.

834
01:21:47,586 --> 01:21:51,957
I'll take you to Renee,
but you got to go first.

835
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,059
Okay?

836
01:21:53,092 --> 01:21:54,760
You go first.

837
01:21:55,662 --> 01:21:56,629
Keys.

838
01:21:56,663 --> 01:21:59,166
Renee.

839
01:22:06,941 --> 01:22:07,908
Here?

840
01:22:13,315 --> 01:22:14,349
Where's Renee?

841
01:22:14,448 --> 01:22:17,018
Now we're talking.

842
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:18,954
Where's Renee?

843
01:22:21,324 --> 01:22:24,694
I wasn't looking
for any of this.

If it were up to me, we never
would have crossed paths,

845
01:22:30,967 --> 01:22:32,802
but your husband
wanted to catch a wolf.

846
01:22:35,839 --> 01:22:37,175
Is that what he told you?

847
01:22:48,153 --> 01:22:49,721
I wanna know who did this.

848
01:22:49,821 --> 01:22:51,489
We've got a blood trail.

849
01:24:33,436 --> 01:24:34,504
Look at me.

850
01:24:36,772 --> 01:24:37,806
Look at me.

851
01:26:01,533 --> 01:26:03,502
We got smoke over here.

852
01:26:07,073 --> 01:26:08,541
Smoke.

2
00:01:13,766 --> 00:01:16,686
The man who said,
"I'd rather be lucky than good,"

3
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:18,966
saw deeply into life.

4
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:22,966
People are afraid to face how great
a part of life is dependent on luck.

5
00:01:23,806 --> 00:01:27,046
It's scary to think so much
is out of one's control.

6
00:01:27,886 --> 00:01:31,846
There are moments in a match
when the ball hits the top of the net,

7
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:36,687
and for a split second
it can either go forward or fall back.

8
00:01:37,646 --> 00:01:41,606
With a little luck,
it goes forward and you win.

9
00:01:41,646 --> 00:01:45,086
Or maybe it doesn't, and you lose.

10
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:50,966
Sorry.

11
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:57,966
Mr. Townsend.

12
00:02:03,126 --> 00:02:05,086
Just this way.

13
00:02:05,846 --> 00:02:08,326
So the Beach Club Marbella,
tennis instructor.

14
00:02:08,406 --> 00:02:11,926
Stanford House.
Forte Village, Sardinia. Nice.

15
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,966
Yes. I've had
a good deal of experience.

16
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:15,566
Yeah, so I see.

17
00:02:15,646 --> 00:02:18,726
Now, I've heard very good things.
You don't miss playing professionally?

18
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,526
I thank God every day
I don't have to do it.

19
00:02:20,606 --> 00:02:23,926
I hate the whole tennis tour thing.

20
00:02:24,006 --> 00:02:28,326
Constant traveling, and I was
never going to be Rusedski or Agassi.

21
00:02:28,406 --> 00:02:30,206
You have to really want it.

22
00:02:30,286 --> 00:02:32,166
Not that I have their talent.

23
00:02:32,646 --> 00:02:35,326
Well, your credentials
and references are excellent.

24
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:37,246
And you want to live in London?

25
00:02:37,326 --> 00:02:40,366
Very much. Very much.

26
00:02:40,446 --> 00:02:43,686
We have a very
exclusive membership here.

27
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:45,606
You can begin this weekend?

28
00:02:46,486 --> 00:02:49,086
Thank you. Thank you very much.

29
00:02:50,326 --> 00:02:53,206
That's your sofa,
which also doubles up as a bed.

30
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:56,086
Which is great, you know,
'cause you can be watching some telly,

31
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,206
ain't got the hassle
of having to go to a bedroom.

32
00:02:58,286 --> 00:03:00,646
You can just open it up, get your kip.

33
00:03:00,726 --> 00:03:02,886
Kitchen just through there.

34
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:06,366
All your amenities, fixtures,
fittings, washer-dryer...

35
00:03:06,446 --> 00:03:07,686
All that stuff.

36
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:10,246
Lovely view, not overlooked.

37
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:12,246
So it's all good.

38
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,846
This is 225 a week?

39
00:03:14,926 --> 00:03:18,606
Well, it's London, mate. Bang, mate.
If you don't like it, move to Leeds.

40
00:03:18,686 --> 00:03:20,486
D'you know what I mean?
You got a wok?

41
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:23,366
You got a wok? It's one of those
Oriental, sort of conical pans.

42
00:03:23,406 --> 00:03:25,566
- No, no, no.
- The geezer who was in here before,

43
00:03:25,646 --> 00:03:28,646
he left one in there. You're
welcome to it. I'll throw that in.

44
00:03:28,726 --> 00:03:31,486
- I'll take it.
- That's a good choice.

45
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,046
Very good.

46
00:04:00,726 --> 00:04:02,206
Chris Wilton.

47
00:04:02,246 --> 00:04:04,046
This is Tom Hewett.

48
00:04:04,126 --> 00:04:06,046
- Very nice to meet you. How do you do?
- Morning. Pleasure.

49
00:04:06,126 --> 00:04:07,846
I think Chris would be
the perfect instructor for you,

50
00:04:07,926 --> 00:04:10,646
and he's very patient.
Great at analyzing a player's faults.

51
00:04:10,686 --> 00:04:13,886
I'm so out of practice. I mean,
I haven't played since university,

52
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:17,246
and I loved it, but I haven't
picked up a racket in bloody ages, so...

53
00:04:17,326 --> 00:04:18,846
Don't worry, it comes back.

54
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,526
What you can't do is rush in,
be discouraged.

55
00:04:21,606 --> 00:04:22,926
OK.

56
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:25,046
- Well, good luck.
- Thank you very much.

57
00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:27,206
- Over here.
- Brilliant.

58
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:43,006
OK, so who was better, or tougher?
Henman or Agassi?

59
00:04:43,086 --> 00:04:45,366
- They were both great.
- Yeah, I know, but I mean,

60
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:47,286
you held your own more than admirably.

61
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:48,766
For a while.

62
00:04:48,846 --> 00:04:51,366
But as the game goes on,
you see how really good they are.

63
00:04:51,446 --> 00:04:53,206
- Actually, I'll get this.
- No, no, no, no.

64
00:04:53,286 --> 00:04:55,766
- No, please, Tom, I insist. I insist.
- No, no, no, no, no.

65
00:04:55,846 --> 00:04:57,726
Get your dirty great forehand off.

66
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,126
Thank you. I'll get the next one.

67
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:04,006
So, do you need a lift after this?

68
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:07,646
Actually, I'm looking for a music store.
I want to buy some CDs.

69
00:05:07,726 --> 00:05:11,406
Music around here?
I think there's one on the Fulham Road.

70
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:13,606
And they'll have a decent opera section?

71
00:05:13,686 --> 00:05:15,726
Opera? You like opera, really?

72
00:05:15,806 --> 00:05:17,046
I love opera.

73
00:05:17,086 --> 00:05:20,246
Papa gives loads
to the Royal in Covent Garden.

74
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:22,206
I know this is gonna sound a bit weird,

75
00:05:22,286 --> 00:05:24,606
but would you like to go
to the opera tomorrow night?

76
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,686
To the opera?

77
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:30,206
Yeah. We've got a box
and someone's not coming.

78
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:32,766
It's La bloody Traviata.

79
00:05:32,806 --> 00:05:35,886
My God. I'd love to.

80
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:38,806
Are you sure it's not an imposition?
Can I at least pay for my seat?

81
00:05:38,886 --> 00:05:41,486
It's not an imposition,
it'd be an absolute pleasure.

82
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:45,726
I just like the fact that we both
share a love for opera. Brilliant.

83
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:48,806
So?

84
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:51,886
- I said to David and Melissa...
- Evening all. Hello, Mum.

85
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:54,046
Hello, sweetie. Very nice to see you.

86
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:56,926
- This is Chris. This is my father Alec.
- Hello. Good to meet you.

87
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:58,926
I hear you're an
incredible tennis player.

88
00:05:59,006 --> 00:06:01,766
I played once, and then I gave up,
then I went back, then I gave up,

89
00:06:01,846 --> 00:06:03,046
- then I went back
- Rubbish.

90
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:05,766
- I'm sure Tom exaggerated my game.
- I just got bored.

91
00:06:05,846 --> 00:06:07,886
- Good evening. My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

92
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:10,526
- This is my sister... Chloe.
- There's a chair somewhere.

93
00:06:10,606 --> 00:06:12,646
- I'm Chloe. Nice to meet you.
- There's two more.

94
00:07:03,126 --> 00:07:07,046
Yeah, well, the olds say thank you
very much for the lovely flowers.

95
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:10,246
They said it was very thoughtful,
and totally unnecessary.

96
00:07:10,326 --> 00:07:14,686
But off the record, well done, A plus,
'cause they love that sort of thing.

97
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:18,326
Oh, they're lovely people.
And your sister's very bright.

98
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:21,046
Frighteningly so at times. But...

99
00:07:21,126 --> 00:07:24,126
Anyway, she thought you were terrific,
and she wanted to invite you

100
00:07:24,206 --> 00:07:27,086
to our country house
with the parents on Sunday.

101
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:30,126
'Cause they're having a party,
there'll be some good people.

102
00:07:30,206 --> 00:07:34,526
And I'll play you some great music,
because Dad's got an epic collection.

103
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:54,766
Chlo-Chlo, do you wanna have
a knock with Chris for a bit?

104
00:07:54,846 --> 00:07:56,686
It's just that
it's 5:00 somewhere, darling,

105
00:07:56,766 --> 00:07:58,926
and I've some serious
cocktails to start making.

106
00:07:59,006 --> 00:08:02,006
Irish! Have you ever had a
Cuba libre or a caipirinha?

107
00:08:02,086 --> 00:08:04,526
It'd be really boring
for Chris to play with me on my own.

108
00:08:04,606 --> 00:08:07,326
It's really boring for him
to play with me, but he's a good sport.

109
00:08:07,406 --> 00:08:10,206
And anyway, you've got better
legs than I've got. Chop-chop.

110
00:08:10,286 --> 00:08:13,246
Don't be silly. I teach people
who have never held a racket before.

111
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,166
- I'm so bad.
- That's how you get better.

112
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,086
Playing with a stronger player. Come on.

113
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,886
OK.

114
00:08:39,846 --> 00:08:41,126
Was I dreadful?

115
00:08:41,206 --> 00:08:43,966
Not at all.
You have a very unique style.

116
00:08:44,046 --> 00:08:47,926
Yeah, it's called clumsy.
How did you get to be so good anyway?

117
00:08:48,006 --> 00:08:50,326
Tom says you played
with some of the real greats.

118
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:53,286
For me, it was a way out
of a poor existence.

119
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,326
Caught the eye of a good coach.
I don't know.

120
00:08:57,446 --> 00:08:59,446
It all came so easy at first.

121
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,086
- Do you enjoy teaching?
- Not really.

122
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:04,086
I mean, it's OK for now,

123
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,886
but I'd cut my throat
if I thought I had to do it forever.

124
00:09:06,966 --> 00:09:08,806
I'd like to do something with my life.

125
00:09:08,886 --> 00:09:12,446
You know, special.
I'd like to make a contribution.

126
00:09:12,526 --> 00:09:15,766
So, you're a poor boy
from Ireland come to London.

127
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:17,566
I love it.

128
00:09:17,646 --> 00:09:20,046
It's so exciting and alive.

129
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,446
I've never seen so much art or theater.

130
00:09:22,526 --> 00:09:24,726
Not that I've taken
much advantage of it yet.

131
00:09:24,766 --> 00:09:27,446
Well, look, if you'd like someone
to show you around,

132
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:31,246
I grew up in Belgravia. I'd be happy
to take you to all the good places.

133
00:09:31,326 --> 00:09:32,566
That'd be great.

134
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:36,606
On one condition: I buy the tickets.

135
00:09:36,646 --> 00:09:38,406
Oh, dear, is that going to be an issue?

136
00:09:38,486 --> 00:09:41,246
I'm afraid it is.
I'm very old-fashioned.

137
00:09:41,286 --> 00:09:44,006
But actually,
I did read something about the...

138
00:09:44,086 --> 00:09:46,366
...exhibition in the Saatchi Gallery.

139
00:09:46,446 --> 00:09:50,326
That's perfect.
It'd be my pleasure to take you.

140
00:09:50,366 --> 00:09:52,566
You're very kind to offer this.

141
00:09:52,646 --> 00:09:55,046
Can I at least give you
some free tennis lessons?

142
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:56,806
OK, it's a deal.

143
00:09:56,886 --> 00:09:59,286
How about Wednesday for the Saatchi?

144
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:00,846
I can do that.

145
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:04,366
- Shall we meet for lunch first?
- It's a date.

146
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:07,206
I'd better get ready.
Your guests will be arriving soon.

147
00:10:07,246 --> 00:10:09,166
Yeah, yeah. Of course. Go.

148
00:10:09,246 --> 00:10:12,406
A sweaty tennis player's
hardly what they expect.

149
00:11:08,846 --> 00:11:12,206
So who's my next victim?

150
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,526
You?

151
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:17,126
I haven't played table tennis
in quite a while.

152
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:20,686
Would you like to play
for a thousand pounds a game?

153
00:11:22,486 --> 00:11:24,126
What did I walk into?

154
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,486
What did I walk into?

155
00:11:38,806 --> 00:11:40,806
It's like this.

156
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:43,606
- May I?
- Please.

157
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:49,846
You have to lean in,
and hit through the ball.

158
00:11:52,806 --> 00:11:55,686
I was doing just fine
until you showed up.

159
00:11:55,766 --> 00:11:57,926
The story of my life.

160
00:11:58,006 --> 00:11:59,446
So, tell me,

161
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:02,286
what's a beautiful, young,
American Ping-Pong player doing

162
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:04,606
mingling amongst
the British upper class?

163
00:12:09,406 --> 00:12:13,766
Did anyone ever tell you,
you play a very aggressive game?

164
00:12:16,406 --> 00:12:19,326
Did anyone ever tell you
you've very sensual lips?

165
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:26,726
- Extremely aggressive.
- I'm naturally competitive.

166
00:12:27,806 --> 00:12:29,806
Is it off-putting?

167
00:12:31,726 --> 00:12:34,246
I'll have to think
about that for a while.

168
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:38,806
There you are.

169
00:12:38,886 --> 00:12:40,926
I wanted to introduce you
to Chris Wilton.

170
00:12:41,006 --> 00:12:44,046
Chris Wilton,
this is Nola Rice, my fiancיe.

171
00:12:45,926 --> 00:12:48,326
So, you're the tennis pro.

172
00:12:48,406 --> 00:12:50,366
- Hello, darling.
- My pleasure.

173
00:12:50,446 --> 00:12:52,806
He was trying to have
his way with me over the table.

174
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:55,646
Oh, really? Yeah, well,
you'd better watch out for this one.

175
00:12:55,726 --> 00:12:57,766
He's made a living out of hustling.

176
00:12:58,126 --> 00:13:00,846
I'll be ready for you next time.

177
00:13:02,686 --> 00:13:06,246
- I'll see you outside.
- Oh, yeah.

178
00:13:13,046 --> 00:13:15,326
She's quite something, isn't she?

179
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:20,526
- How long have you been together?
- Six months.

180
00:13:20,606 --> 00:13:22,726
Jesus, yeah, six months!

181
00:13:22,806 --> 00:13:25,206
She came over to study acting,
and I met her at a party

182
00:13:25,286 --> 00:13:27,366
that I'd crashed
and she'd crashed, and...

183
00:13:27,446 --> 00:13:30,126
...one thing led to another.

184
00:13:30,886 --> 00:13:33,886
Obviously, it's taken Mother quite
a long time to get used to the idea

185
00:13:33,966 --> 00:13:35,486
that I'm serious about her, but...

186
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:36,566
To be honest with you,

187
00:13:36,646 --> 00:13:38,926
Mother's always had
this funny little agenda for me

188
00:13:39,006 --> 00:13:42,286
which doesn't really involve
marrying a struggling actress.

189
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:44,446
Especially an American one.

190
00:13:46,046 --> 00:13:48,406
But I am crazy about her.

191
00:13:48,486 --> 00:13:52,166
Anyway, I think we should all go to
dinner next week. What do you think?

192
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:54,246
- I'd love to.
- Excellent.

193
00:13:54,326 --> 00:13:57,846
Now, Irish, how about a little drop
of Scottish before supper?

194
00:13:57,926 --> 00:14:01,246
- Why not.
- Lead on. Quickly.

195
00:14:41,086 --> 00:14:43,726
These afternoons have been great.

196
00:14:44,486 --> 00:14:47,726
I'm so glad your schedule
allows you so much time off.

197
00:14:47,806 --> 00:14:49,406
Yes, it's fun.

198
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:52,126
Although it wouldn't hurt
to have a few more pupils.

199
00:14:54,366 --> 00:14:56,366
Do you need money?

200
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:58,246
God, no.

201
00:14:58,526 --> 00:15:00,126
No, I'm fine.

202
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,886
It's very sweet of you to ask,
but I don't.

203
00:15:09,046 --> 00:15:12,566
I'm only asking
because I care about you.

204
00:15:30,286 --> 00:15:33,126
Shall we go to your place or mine?

205
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,446
I don't think mine's
quite what you're used to.

206
00:15:35,526 --> 00:15:39,406
Shut up. I think yours'll be just great.

207
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:02,726
You've been seeing a lot
of Chris Wilton lately, I understand.

208
00:16:02,806 --> 00:16:06,406
- Yeah. He's very nice.
- I liked him.

209
00:16:06,486 --> 00:16:09,246
I just don't understand
what he's aiming for.

210
00:16:09,326 --> 00:16:12,206
He certainly doesn't want to be
a tennis pro for the rest of his life.

211
00:16:12,246 --> 00:16:14,526
Well, I find him very likeable.

212
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:18,046
He's fought his way up the only way
open to him, and he's not trivial.

213
00:16:18,126 --> 00:16:22,406
I had a very interesting conversation
the other day about Dostoyevsky.

214
00:16:22,486 --> 00:16:24,446
Can't we do something for him?

215
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,846
A place in one of
your companies or something?

216
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:28,206
Has he expressed a desire?

217
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:31,926
No, but... he's open,
you know, about his future.

218
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:34,246
He really wants
to make something of his life.

219
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,366
Chloe, be careful.

220
00:16:36,446 --> 00:16:40,366
Tom's involved with a woman I have
reservations about. Don't rush off.

221
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:43,366
Tom's happy with Nola.
You're prejudiced 'cause she's American.

222
00:16:43,406 --> 00:16:45,286
She's spoilt and temperamental.

223
00:16:45,366 --> 00:16:47,206
She's an actress, they're emotional.

224
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:50,526
She's deluding herself, and she's moody.
She's not right for Tom.

225
00:16:50,606 --> 00:16:53,846
Well, I care very deeply for Chris,
and I think he feels the same way.

226
00:16:53,886 --> 00:16:56,246
- Who are you talking about?
- Nola.

227
00:17:09,046 --> 00:17:11,366
- Have you been waiting ages?
- Hello. Not at all.

228
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:13,926
Traffic was awful.
The others'll be here in a minute.

229
00:17:14,006 --> 00:17:15,886
They're probably
stuck in it somewhere.

230
00:17:15,966 --> 00:17:17,886
Can I have a champagne cocktail, please?

231
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:24,166
One of your father's associates spoke to
me today about the possibility of a job.

232
00:17:24,246 --> 00:17:25,806
Did you say anything?

233
00:17:25,886 --> 00:17:30,286
Look, I just told Papa to keep his
eyes open if anything juicy opened up,

234
00:17:30,326 --> 00:17:33,166
so you could have first option,
if you wanted it.

235
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,926
- You're not cross, are you?
- God, no.

236
00:17:36,006 --> 00:17:38,886
It's extremely thoughtful of you.

237
00:17:40,446 --> 00:17:42,446
Thanks.

238
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:44,486
What do you think?

239
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,566
I'm gonna have to think about it.

240
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:50,446
I've never really seen myself
in the business world.

241
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:57,286
So, what do you see for yourself,
you know, in the future?

242
00:17:58,246 --> 00:18:00,046
I don't know, really.

243
00:18:02,126 --> 00:18:04,606
I mean, I'm sure
it's a great opportunity.

244
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:06,406
I think it is.

245
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:09,846
Papa said it's a chance
to learn the business.

246
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:13,566
And if things go well,
he'll see to it, you know, that...

247
00:18:13,646 --> 00:18:15,846
...you move up quickly, or whatever.

248
00:18:16,886 --> 00:18:19,766
I've always felt so-so
about office work.

249
00:18:19,846 --> 00:18:21,926
It's not exactly office work.

250
00:18:22,006 --> 00:18:25,486
Think of it more as a stepping stone.

251
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:26,606
To?

252
00:18:26,686 --> 00:18:30,646
To a bigger job, more responsibility,

253
00:18:30,686 --> 00:18:33,646
greater earning potential, I don't know.

254
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:38,766
You've always said how much
you admire Papa's accomplishments.

255
00:18:39,526 --> 00:18:41,046
Of course.

256
00:18:41,126 --> 00:18:44,286
I mean, it's strange,
but coming where I come from,

257
00:18:44,366 --> 00:18:47,486
I've always admired
men like your father.

258
00:18:47,566 --> 00:18:50,006
Wealthy, but not stuffy.

259
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:52,126
Enjoying his fortune.

260
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:55,366
Having a grand time,
supporting the arts.

261
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:58,806
Well, he'd really like
to open some doors for you, that's all.

262
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,686
He's a very generous man.

263
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:04,526
He respects how you've pulled
yourself up, against the odds.

264
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:11,046
- You don't seem very enthusiastic.
- I'm sorry.

265
00:19:11,126 --> 00:19:13,006
I hope my hesitation isn't upsetting.

266
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:15,886
No, no, not at all.
It's just that, you know,

267
00:19:15,926 --> 00:19:19,566
you've always talked about
making a contribution and... I'm sorry.

268
00:19:19,646 --> 00:19:22,086
I will. I promise.

269
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:25,206
- Oh, good.
- Hello.

270
00:19:25,286 --> 00:19:26,526
Hi, guys.

271
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,926
Hello.

272
00:19:32,806 --> 00:19:35,406
Don't worry, the traffic was awful.

273
00:19:35,486 --> 00:19:39,206
It's my fault, I dragged Nola
to the classic car show at ExCeL.

274
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:41,246
- Really?
- It was unbelievable.

275
00:19:41,326 --> 00:19:43,126
I swear, my trousers have barely dried.

276
00:19:43,206 --> 00:19:44,406
Oh, God. Shut up.

277
00:19:44,486 --> 00:19:46,046
You love your cars, don't you, Chris?

278
00:19:46,126 --> 00:19:49,246
- I think the old ones are beautiful.
- Yeah, I like the old ones.

279
00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:53,206
But Tom likes all those new ones
with the gadgets and...

280
00:19:53,286 --> 00:19:55,486
I want an Aston Martin.

281
00:19:55,606 --> 00:19:57,446
- I drove an Aston Martin.
- Really?

282
00:19:57,526 --> 00:20:00,926
Yeah, I used to work for a man,
and I used to wash his cars for him.

283
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,086
- He was very, very particular about
- Thank you.

284
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,126
Taking care of them, so I had to
wash them every day with a toothbrush.

285
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:10,926
I want an Aston Martin, or one of
those vintage convertible Mercedes.

286
00:20:11,006 --> 00:20:14,166
Well, when we're married
we'll collect vintage cars.

287
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:17,366
Just as long as I can have a DB9
with all the trimmings. OK?

288
00:20:17,446 --> 00:20:20,046
In fact, Hedley is perfect
for keeping all those cars.

289
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:23,486
- In fact, speaking of Hedley...
- Should we order, 'cause he's waiting.

290
00:20:23,526 --> 00:20:26,286
Frightfully sorry. I'll have
the baked potato with truffles.

291
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:28,686
- That'll be lovely. Yum-yum.
- I'd like the same, please.

292
00:20:28,766 --> 00:20:30,726
Nothing to start?

293
00:20:30,806 --> 00:20:32,406
Oh, I think the wine list.

294
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,926
I'll have the caviar blinis, please.

295
00:20:36,006 --> 00:20:38,806
- Roast chicken.
- God, boring!

296
00:20:38,886 --> 00:20:41,486
Honestly, they have the
greatest caviar blinis here.

297
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:43,286
- You should try them.
- That's OK.

298
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:46,286
- No, do you like caviar?
- So-so.

299
00:20:46,366 --> 00:20:47,886
"So-so."

300
00:20:47,966 --> 00:20:51,926
He's been brought up as a good boy, to
always order modestly. I'm very sorry.

301
00:20:52,006 --> 00:20:53,886
He'll have the blinis.

302
00:20:54,006 --> 00:20:57,686
My goodness, was your father an oil
rigger who specialized in etiquette?

303
00:20:57,766 --> 00:20:59,726
He was kind of austere.

304
00:20:59,766 --> 00:21:01,926
Chris's dad was a bit
of a religious fanatic.

305
00:21:02,006 --> 00:21:03,006
Oh, Christ.

306
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:05,006
After he lost both his legs,
he found Jesus.

307
00:21:06,046 --> 00:21:09,486
God. Sorry, but it just
doesn't seem like a fair trade.

308
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:12,846
What were you saying about Hedley?

309
00:21:12,926 --> 00:21:15,606
- Papa's invited us for some shooting.
- Oh, really?

310
00:21:15,686 --> 00:21:17,526
I'd better bring
a different change of clothes.

311
00:21:17,606 --> 00:21:20,206
I don't think your mother
appreciated what I brought last time.

312
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:23,046
I think that was your swimsuit.
She's used to slightly more fabric.

313
00:21:23,126 --> 00:21:26,926
I'm sure if she knew you'd worn it
in a movie, she'd suddenly find it chic.

314
00:21:27,006 --> 00:21:29,566
- True.
- Have you done many movies?

315
00:21:29,646 --> 00:21:32,246
It was a commercial, not a movie.

316
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:35,126
But your eyes went straight to her,
if you know what I mean.

317
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:38,886
I don't think my career has...
really gone as planned.

318
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:40,366
Oh, you just need a break.

319
00:21:40,446 --> 00:21:42,566
I think it's important
to be lucky in anything.

320
00:21:42,646 --> 00:21:44,766
Well, I don't believe in luck.
I believe in hard work.

321
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:46,606
Oh, hard work is mandatory,

322
00:21:46,686 --> 00:21:49,926
but I think everybody's afraid
to admit what a big part luck plays.

323
00:21:50,006 --> 00:21:52,206
I mean, it seems scientists are...

324
00:21:52,246 --> 00:21:56,126
...confirming more and more that
all existence is here by blind chance.

325
00:21:56,206 --> 00:21:59,126
No purpose, no design.

326
00:21:59,726 --> 00:22:01,846
Well, I don't care,
I love every minute of it.

327
00:22:01,926 --> 00:22:03,806
And I envy you for it.

328
00:22:03,886 --> 00:22:06,886
What was it the...
the vicar used to say?

329
00:22:06,966 --> 00:22:09,606
"Despair is the path
of least resistance."

330
00:22:09,686 --> 00:22:12,086
It was something odd, wasn't it?
It was very strange...

331
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,446
I think that faith
is the path of least resistance.

332
00:22:14,526 --> 00:22:15,806
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

333
00:22:15,886 --> 00:22:17,526
Can we change the subject, please?

334
00:22:17,606 --> 00:22:20,886
Nola was talking about acting,
which is much more interesting.

335
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:22,606
No, I was...

336
00:22:22,686 --> 00:22:27,286
...just saying that I think
I'm giving acting a second thought.

337
00:22:27,366 --> 00:22:31,806
I just can't bear people
in my hometown to think I've failed.

338
00:22:31,886 --> 00:22:34,526
Not that I'm ever
going back to Colorado.

339
00:22:34,606 --> 00:22:35,886
Ever.

340
00:22:35,966 --> 00:22:38,446
Have you decided on a wine?

341
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:42,486
Two bottles of Puligny-Montrachet.
Thank you.

342
00:22:42,846 --> 00:22:42,966
- Good morning. Chris Wilton.
- Rod Carver.

343
00:22:42,966 --> 00:22:44,646
- Good morning. Chris Wilton.
- Rod Carver.

344
00:22:44,726 --> 00:22:45,926
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

345
00:22:46,006 --> 00:22:49,526
You'll be working
under Alan Sinclair here.

346
00:22:49,606 --> 00:22:50,846
Hi, Alan. How are you?

347
00:22:50,926 --> 00:22:54,526
At first, you may find the
assignments a little unchallenging,

348
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:57,766
but that'll soon change as you
appreciate how things wash here.

349
00:22:57,846 --> 00:22:59,806
- It's basically nine to five.
- Yes, yes.

350
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:02,566
So you'll have plenty of time
to keep up the backhand, if you like.

351
00:23:02,646 --> 00:23:04,366
Now, if you're OK with the package,

352
00:23:04,446 --> 00:23:06,606
we'd like to begin
the first of the month.

353
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:08,486
I'm sure the salary won't be a problem.

354
00:23:08,526 --> 00:23:10,606
- Good to meet you, Alan.
- Good. And you.

355
00:23:10,686 --> 00:23:11,646
And Rod.

356
00:23:11,726 --> 00:23:12,926
- I'm sure you'll be happy here.
- I'm sure I will.

357
00:23:13,006 --> 00:23:14,366
- Exciting things are happening.
- OK.

358
00:23:18,566 --> 00:23:21,566
I can't tell you how happy I am
you've taken that job.

359
00:23:21,646 --> 00:23:24,206
It's such good news.

360
00:23:25,606 --> 00:23:27,926
Here, I brought you this to celebrate.

361
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,446
Wow. Thank you.

362
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:35,006
Believe me, in no time
you'll be running that division.

363
00:23:35,086 --> 00:23:38,886
You're so much more on the ball
than Alan Sinclair. He's nice, but...

364
00:23:39,606 --> 00:23:42,606
...uninspiring.
- It's very rare.

365
00:23:42,686 --> 00:23:44,646
It has some beautiful arias on it.

366
00:23:44,726 --> 00:23:46,446
And his voice expresses

367
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,846
everything that's tragic about life.

368
00:23:49,566 --> 00:23:52,606
- You find it tragic, do you?
- And you?

369
00:23:56,406 --> 00:23:58,366
I love it.

370
00:24:00,046 --> 00:24:04,606
Let's stay at home and have dinner,
and listen to the tragedy.

371
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:09,166
I'm gonna open one of those
bottles of wine I got you.

372
00:24:09,846 --> 00:24:11,806
Puligny-Montrachet.

373
00:24:11,886 --> 00:24:14,206
I never heard of it
before Tom ordered it.

374
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,606
Now I'm addicted.

375
00:24:15,686 --> 00:24:18,406
Tom and Nola invited us
to go and see a film with them tonight,

376
00:24:18,486 --> 00:24:20,166
but I told them we're busy.

377
00:24:22,886 --> 00:24:24,886
But we have no plans.

378
00:24:24,966 --> 00:24:26,926
Well, no special plans.

379
00:24:27,846 --> 00:24:29,846
I thought we said we'd stay in?

380
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:33,486
Yeah, but it wasn't written in stone.

381
00:24:33,566 --> 00:24:35,166
We could've joined them.

382
00:24:35,246 --> 00:24:37,686
We still can, if you'd prefer it.

383
00:24:39,486 --> 00:24:43,126
It's... it's not a case
of preferring it, it's just...

384
00:24:43,886 --> 00:24:47,206
...we always have fun with them,
and you love films.

385
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:49,566
Well, shall I call them?

386
00:24:51,726 --> 00:24:54,286
I mean, sure, unless you'd rather not.

387
00:24:55,646 --> 00:24:57,646
Well...

388
00:24:57,726 --> 00:25:00,606
It might be more fun,
just the two of us.

389
00:25:00,686 --> 00:25:03,166
The wine, the opera.

390
00:25:04,206 --> 00:25:06,246
Absolutely.

391
00:25:15,726 --> 00:25:17,606
I just figured...

392
00:25:18,486 --> 00:25:21,246
We can stay in any... any night, and...

393
00:25:21,886 --> 00:25:24,326
...they're free and suggested a film.

394
00:25:24,406 --> 00:25:25,726
What's the film?

395
00:25:25,806 --> 00:25:28,446
I don't know, but if you'd prefer it.

396
00:25:30,286 --> 00:25:32,406
I am in the mood for a film.

397
00:25:37,606 --> 00:25:39,606
Thank you so much, fella.

398
00:25:40,326 --> 00:25:44,806
Hello. Oh, hang on, I'm having problems
with the door. There we go.

399
00:25:44,886 --> 00:25:47,046
- Hello, sweetie.
- Hi, guys. One second.

400
00:25:48,686 --> 00:25:50,686
There you go, fella. Thanks so much.

401
00:25:50,766 --> 00:25:53,126
- Good luck with the Sky Blues.
- Oh, yeah, cheers.

402
00:25:53,926 --> 00:25:55,166
Where is she?

403
00:25:55,366 --> 00:25:58,726
Nola got a migraine at the last moment,
and unfortunately she can't make it.

404
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:00,886
- Oh, no. Is she gonna be all right?
- But she sends her love.

405
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,526
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

406
00:26:02,606 --> 00:26:05,726
- Hell with her, Motorcycle Diaries!
- I bet that was her choice.

407
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:08,286
I can't believe this is
what you really want to see.

408
00:26:09,806 --> 00:26:12,126
Everybody likes you at work.

409
00:26:13,726 --> 00:26:16,766
Papa says he's heard great things.

410
00:26:18,926 --> 00:26:21,526
You're a very clever boy.

411
00:26:39,366 --> 00:26:40,846
Hey!

412
00:26:41,206 --> 00:26:42,566
Hey.

413
00:26:42,606 --> 00:26:44,246
- Hi.
- How are you?

414
00:26:44,326 --> 00:26:47,966
- What are you doing here?
- I was just looking for a sweater.

415
00:26:48,046 --> 00:26:50,846
The kind Tom has. Is it cashmere?

416
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:53,326
It's vicuסa.

417
00:26:53,406 --> 00:26:54,846
- Vicuסa.
- Vicuסa?

418
00:26:54,886 --> 00:26:56,166
- Yeah.
- Right.

419
00:26:56,246 --> 00:26:57,286
Where are you going?

420
00:26:57,366 --> 00:27:00,046
Oh, I'm just
having a nervous breakdown.

421
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:01,086
- Why?
- So...

422
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:03,646
Well, I have an audition
in ten minutes and...

423
00:27:03,726 --> 00:27:08,286
As usual, my confidence level, which
started off at a ten, is now at a zero.

424
00:27:08,366 --> 00:27:12,006
- Don't worry, you'll be great.
- Yeah. I'm gonna be late, so...

425
00:27:12,086 --> 00:27:14,526
- Are you walk? You wanna walk?
- Yeah, sure.

426
00:27:16,046 --> 00:27:19,046
My agent was supposed
to meet me, but he canceled.

427
00:27:19,126 --> 00:27:23,406
So that's... awful.
I'm alone to...

428
00:27:23,446 --> 00:27:26,526
Would you like me to come along
for moral support?

429
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:30,206
- Yes. That would be great. If you...
- Sure.

430
00:27:30,286 --> 00:27:32,366
- If it's not a problem.
- It's not a problem.

431
00:27:32,446 --> 00:27:33,846
- No, it's not a problem.
- OK.

432
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:36,446
I used to get really tense
before big tennis matches.

433
00:27:38,126 --> 00:27:39,806
Have you ever tried yoga?

434
00:27:40,446 --> 00:27:42,566
- No.
- No?

435
00:28:38,326 --> 00:28:39,806
Hi.

436
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:41,846
- Hello. Hi.
- Oh, hey.

437
00:28:42,126 --> 00:28:44,726
- How was it?
- Blew that.

438
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,006
It just works, you know, at home, but...

439
00:28:47,086 --> 00:28:50,686
I don't know,
I just can never really pull through...

440
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:53,006
...in the end.
- You will. You will.

441
00:28:53,086 --> 00:28:54,406
Yeah.

442
00:28:55,606 --> 00:28:56,646
You know what,

443
00:28:56,726 --> 00:28:59,606
I could actually use a drink
just to pull myself together...

444
00:28:59,686 --> 00:29:01,126
...a little bit.
- Sure.

445
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,166
- OK.
- This way.

446
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:16,526
What was I saying?

447
00:29:20,206 --> 00:29:23,406
My sister went to college
for a couple of years.

448
00:29:23,486 --> 00:29:26,166
But I'm like you, I'm self-taught.

449
00:29:26,566 --> 00:29:28,566
You should see my sister, she's...

450
00:29:28,646 --> 00:29:33,806
...she's very beautiful,
but she's lost in drugs and...

451
00:29:33,886 --> 00:29:36,646
I'm sure she's not
more beautiful than you are.

452
00:29:38,366 --> 00:29:41,286
What I am is sexy. But Linda's...

453
00:29:41,366 --> 00:29:43,126
My sister...

454
00:29:44,126 --> 00:29:46,966
...is classically beautiful.

455
00:29:49,326 --> 00:29:52,086
So, you are aware
of your effect on men?

456
00:29:53,886 --> 00:29:57,046
Before my parents split,
they used to put her in these pageants.

457
00:29:58,766 --> 00:30:00,726
It's just a joke.

458
00:30:01,526 --> 00:30:03,326
What did your father do?

459
00:30:05,286 --> 00:30:08,126
He... left.

460
00:30:09,246 --> 00:30:11,766
And never sent any money.

461
00:30:11,846 --> 00:30:14,206
And my mother
could never hold down a job.

462
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:17,006
- No?
- No.

463
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:20,446
Her problem was that she drank.

464
00:30:22,726 --> 00:30:24,726
How did you meet Tom?

465
00:30:28,446 --> 00:30:29,926
We met at a party.

466
00:30:30,006 --> 00:30:31,206
He...

467
00:30:31,286 --> 00:30:33,006
...saw me across the room

468
00:30:33,086 --> 00:30:37,326
and he honed in on me,
like a guided missile.

469
00:30:37,806 --> 00:30:38,806
And I...

470
00:30:38,886 --> 00:30:40,726
I liked him right off, you know.

471
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:42,606
I thought...

472
00:30:43,406 --> 00:30:45,606
Well, I think he's very handsome.

473
00:30:45,686 --> 00:30:46,926
Don't you?

474
00:30:47,006 --> 00:30:48,846
Very.

475
00:30:48,926 --> 00:30:51,166
And he asked you to marry him?

476
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,446
Well, he...

477
00:30:55,526 --> 00:31:00,326
...swept me off of my feet
with presents and, you know...

478
00:31:00,366 --> 00:31:02,326
What did I know
about that kind of life?

479
00:31:02,366 --> 00:31:05,526
I'm just a starving actress
from Boulder, Colorado.

480
00:31:05,606 --> 00:31:07,046
But...

481
00:31:07,526 --> 00:31:11,566
I had another bad marriage behind me.
That's another reason she hates me.

482
00:31:11,646 --> 00:31:15,406
- Who?
- Eleanor. Tom's mother.

483
00:31:15,566 --> 00:31:17,886
She wants him
to marry this girl named Olivia,

484
00:31:17,966 --> 00:31:20,926
who I think is a distant cousin.
I don't know. It's... it's sick.

485
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:23,446
It's such an inbred family. It's...

486
00:31:23,486 --> 00:31:25,886
And was it love at first sight
for you too?

487
00:31:30,446 --> 00:31:32,846
I thought he was very handsome.

488
00:31:32,926 --> 00:31:35,886
You know, and I told you I was just...

489
00:31:36,366 --> 00:31:39,406
I was overwhelmed with attention.

490
00:31:42,206 --> 00:31:44,686
So, what about you and Chloe?

491
00:31:47,726 --> 00:31:49,726
She's very sweet.

492
00:31:52,806 --> 00:31:54,806
She is very sweet.

493
00:31:57,086 --> 00:31:59,046
And she wants to marry you.

494
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,726
I don't think her mother
would approve of that either.

495
00:32:01,806 --> 00:32:04,006
No. No, it's different.

496
00:32:04,086 --> 00:32:07,526
I don't buy into Eleanor,
and she knows it, but you...

497
00:32:08,566 --> 00:32:10,566
...are being groomed.

498
00:32:10,646 --> 00:32:12,326
You mark my words.

499
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:15,766
They almost died when they thought
that Chloe had run off with some...

500
00:32:15,806 --> 00:32:18,486
...guy that ran a gastropub in the city.

501
00:32:18,566 --> 00:32:20,046
But...

502
00:32:23,046 --> 00:32:27,206
You're gonna do very well
for yourself, unless you blow it.

503
00:32:28,366 --> 00:32:30,406
And how am I going to blow it?

504
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,406
By making a pass at me.

505
00:32:38,606 --> 00:32:40,966
And what makes you think
that's gonna happen?

506
00:32:43,206 --> 00:32:45,566
Men always seem to wonder.

507
00:32:47,406 --> 00:32:50,686
They think I'd be
something very special.

508
00:32:50,766 --> 00:32:52,726
And are you?

509
00:32:55,886 --> 00:32:58,726
Well, no one's ever
asked for their money back.

510
00:33:02,086 --> 00:33:05,246
Where was all this confidence
when you needed it in the audition?

511
00:33:11,926 --> 00:33:14,046
I've had too much to drink.

512
00:33:15,566 --> 00:33:17,526
Can you get me a cab?

513
00:33:17,606 --> 00:33:19,606
Sure.

514
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:40,846
Thank you.

515
00:33:41,406 --> 00:33:42,926
You were driving a bit fast,

516
00:33:43,006 --> 00:33:44,486
- weren't you?
- Good morning.

517
00:33:44,726 --> 00:33:47,446
- Which one is he in?
- Second one over there.

518
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,486
Oh, hi.

519
00:33:48,566 --> 00:33:49,766
So, do you think
he's gonna be all right?

520
00:33:49,846 --> 00:33:51,886
Carmichael came and had a look at him
the other week.

521
00:33:51,966 --> 00:33:53,366
Oh, he's so sweet.

522
00:33:53,446 --> 00:33:55,366
The problem with the right hind
is gonna...

523
00:33:55,446 --> 00:33:57,406
It should have dissipated fully already.

524
00:33:57,486 --> 00:33:59,726
- Tom, can I feed him?
- Yeah, yeah, wack him some hay.

525
00:33:59,806 --> 00:34:01,366
Tom, do you think he's
gonna be able to play on Sunday?

526
00:34:01,446 --> 00:34:04,326
Well, he will play on Sunday,
but it's just the problem with the fact

527
00:34:04,406 --> 00:34:07,126
that it's only Lopez who can ride him,
and he's injured at the moment.

528
00:34:07,206 --> 00:34:09,046
We're having a bloody nightmare
with injuries.

529
00:34:09,126 --> 00:34:11,126
You're so beautiful.

530
00:34:11,206 --> 00:34:16,446
What would you say to the idea
of taking a business course at school

531
00:34:16,526 --> 00:34:18,806
that the company would pay for?

532
00:34:18,886 --> 00:34:20,446
I don't know.

533
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:27,206
I've had very good
feedback on your work.

534
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,366
And the beginning of next year

535
00:34:29,446 --> 00:34:32,366
there's going to be a very
significant position opening up.

536
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:36,366
One that carries a great deal
of responsibility and pays accordingly.

537
00:34:36,446 --> 00:34:39,246
Plus, there are a number of perks...

538
00:34:39,326 --> 00:34:43,366
Expense account, driver, et cetera.

539
00:34:43,446 --> 00:34:45,966
We had been focusing on someone else...

540
00:34:46,886 --> 00:34:50,406
...but it's obvious to me
that you and Chloe have become close.

541
00:34:50,486 --> 00:34:53,846
Although I wouldn't consider it,
if I didn't think you were qualified.

542
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,486
I'd hate to disappoint you.

543
00:34:56,726 --> 00:34:58,286
- Oh, excuse me.
- Come on, Chris...

544
00:34:58,366 --> 00:35:00,326
We're nearly ready.

545
00:35:00,406 --> 00:35:02,806
- I'll bring a gun for Chris.
- Thanks, Tom.

546
00:35:07,726 --> 00:35:08,766
Never mind, fella.

547
00:35:08,846 --> 00:35:12,446
This is basically a tune-up for the
grouse season, which is starting soon.

548
00:35:12,526 --> 00:35:15,406
- But it's bloody good fun.
- Don't frighten him.

549
00:35:15,486 --> 00:35:17,926
His shooting's not really up
to his tennis, poor thing.

550
00:35:18,006 --> 00:35:19,966
I'll make an accomplished
grouse shooter of him yet.

551
00:35:20,046 --> 00:35:22,206
- Don't you worry, Chris.
- Quite right, Papa.

552
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,246
Come on, Chloe.

553
00:35:26,806 --> 00:35:28,086
Hi, darling.

554
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,766
Have you seen my Strindberg book?

555
00:35:29,846 --> 00:35:31,166
No.

556
00:35:31,246 --> 00:35:33,006
How did your audition go?

557
00:35:33,086 --> 00:35:36,366
Oh, it was pretty awful, I'm afraid.

558
00:35:36,406 --> 00:35:39,286
It's her own fault, bless her.
She just tightens up.

559
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:42,206
Well, I'm sure something
worthwhile will come along.

560
00:35:42,246 --> 00:35:46,726
Unfortunately, there's just not anything
right now that I'm that great for.

561
00:35:48,766 --> 00:35:51,046
So, how long do you keep it up?

562
00:35:53,366 --> 00:35:54,926
How long?

563
00:35:55,006 --> 00:35:58,286
Well, if time passes
and nothing significant materializes,

564
00:35:58,366 --> 00:36:02,886
how long do you keep on going
before you decide that?

565
00:36:02,966 --> 00:36:05,646
To try something else?

566
00:36:05,966 --> 00:36:08,366
I hardly think Nola's
reached that point, Mother.

567
00:36:08,446 --> 00:36:09,446
I'm not saying that.

568
00:36:09,526 --> 00:36:12,206
All I'm saying is
you give acting a try for a time,

569
00:36:12,286 --> 00:36:16,006
and if you keep being disappointed
you have to ask yourself the question,

570
00:36:16,046 --> 00:36:20,206
"Is this really what I want in my life?
Is this what I want?"

571
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:22,526
Well, I do ask myself that.

572
00:36:22,606 --> 00:36:24,726
See? It's only logical, Tom.

573
00:36:24,806 --> 00:36:27,086
Especially for a woman.

574
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:30,006
It's a particularly
cruel business for a woman,

575
00:36:30,086 --> 00:36:32,806
and as you get older and time passes,

576
00:36:32,886 --> 00:36:35,126
if nothing happens
it gets harder and harder.

577
00:36:35,886 --> 00:36:38,726
Eleanor,
Nola isn't exactly over the hill.

578
00:36:39,686 --> 00:36:42,366
I'm not saying now.

579
00:36:42,446 --> 00:36:46,406
But I'm a great one
for facing up to realities.

580
00:36:46,566 --> 00:36:49,486
Your take on these realities
is your own opinion and nothing else.

581
00:36:49,566 --> 00:36:52,046
Frankly, not everybody else
is interested in hearing about it.

582
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,286
Tom, don't raise your voice
to your mother, please.

583
00:36:54,366 --> 00:36:56,406
I'm not raising my voice.
And I'm sorry, Papa,

584
00:36:56,486 --> 00:37:00,406
but she's always on Nola's case,
continually discouraging her via...

585
00:37:00,486 --> 00:37:01,846
...innuendos.

586
00:37:01,926 --> 00:37:04,566
All I'm saying is acting's
so will-o'-the-wisp.

587
00:37:04,646 --> 00:37:06,686
Those that have it, know it right off.

588
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:09,286
To pursue it because
you don't want to admit defeat

589
00:37:09,366 --> 00:37:12,206
to friends back home is,
frankly, unrealistic.

590
00:37:12,286 --> 00:37:14,286
I'm sorry, but that's the way I feel.

591
00:37:14,886 --> 00:37:16,206
Excuse me.

592
00:37:16,846 --> 00:37:17,846
Nola.

593
00:37:17,926 --> 00:37:20,126
It's OK. I'd like to be alone, thanks.

594
00:37:20,206 --> 00:37:23,126
Well, thank you very much. And I'm
sorry if I'm raising my voice now,

595
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:25,406
but you know that's her
Achilles heel, emotionally.

596
00:37:25,446 --> 00:37:29,006
He's right, Eleanor. I think
you've had one too many G and T's.

597
00:38:44,846 --> 00:38:46,326
I was looking for you.

598
00:38:47,846 --> 00:38:50,486
I was upset.
I just wanted to be alone.

599
00:38:50,566 --> 00:38:52,526
I don't mean to intrude.

600
00:38:53,766 --> 00:38:55,686
I need a drink.

601
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:58,526
I like you when you drink.
You get flirtatious.

602
00:38:58,606 --> 00:39:00,566
- Do I?
- Yeah.

603
00:39:00,646 --> 00:39:03,006
- Confident.
- I don't think this was a good idea.

604
00:39:03,046 --> 00:39:04,686
You shouldn't have followed me here.

605
00:39:04,766 --> 00:39:06,766
Do you feel guilty?

606
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:10,046
Do you?

607
00:39:18,046 --> 00:39:20,046
We can't do this.

608
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:22,686
I know.

609
00:39:29,886 --> 00:39:31,886
This can't lead anyplace.

610
00:40:47,766 --> 00:40:48,766
Hello.

611
00:40:49,846 --> 00:40:51,806
Darling, I think it's for you.

612
00:40:52,806 --> 00:40:54,686
But take it outside.

613
00:41:10,246 --> 00:41:12,326
Well, there's hope, at least.

614
00:41:12,406 --> 00:41:14,566
When's the callback?

615
00:41:16,646 --> 00:41:18,806
Just let me know
when you hear anything at all,

616
00:41:18,886 --> 00:41:22,086
'cause I really think
I could be great in this part.

617
00:41:23,246 --> 00:41:25,966
Yeah. OK.

618
00:41:26,046 --> 00:41:27,126
Bye.

619
00:41:27,886 --> 00:41:29,886
Why have you been so cold to me?

620
00:41:29,966 --> 00:41:32,686
- I haven't been cold.
- Yes, you have.

621
00:41:32,766 --> 00:41:34,926
Ever since we came back
from the countryside

622
00:41:35,006 --> 00:41:37,406
you've been distant, evasive.

623
00:41:37,486 --> 00:41:39,606
I don't want to encourage anything.

624
00:41:39,686 --> 00:41:42,006
What happened, happened, Chris.

625
00:41:42,086 --> 00:41:45,046
I mean... The moment was very
out of control for many reasons.

626
00:41:45,126 --> 00:41:47,806
I was upset, I was drinking,
and the storm was overpowering.

627
00:41:47,886 --> 00:41:50,606
- Oh, stop rationalizing.
- I'm not rationalizing.

628
00:41:50,646 --> 00:41:54,726
Passions are passions, but we're
both very involved with other people.

629
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:58,086
You're not such a good actress,
you know. It's not possible.

630
00:41:58,686 --> 00:42:01,806
Look, you daydreamed
about making love to me,

631
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,686
and I'm not saying the fantasy
didn't cross my mind, OK?

632
00:42:04,726 --> 00:42:06,046
We had our moment.

633
00:42:06,126 --> 00:42:08,606
But, you know, let's move on,
get back to reality.

634
00:42:08,686 --> 00:42:10,926
Chris, we're gonna be
brother and sister-in-law.

635
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,966
You were exactly
as I pictured you'd be making love.

636
00:42:14,046 --> 00:42:16,286
Chris, forget it. It's over.

637
00:42:29,366 --> 00:42:31,926
Thanks. Henry!

638
00:42:32,006 --> 00:42:34,646
- Hey. How are you?
- Chris. All right.

639
00:42:34,726 --> 00:42:36,246
- Look at you.
- Good to see you.

640
00:42:36,326 --> 00:42:38,606
Looks like you're doing
all right for yourself, aren't you?

641
00:42:38,686 --> 00:42:40,406
- Thanks.
- You still doing the tennis tour?

642
00:42:40,486 --> 00:42:42,206
Yeah, I love it. I love it.
Look at this car.

643
00:42:42,286 --> 00:42:44,646
Oh, don't worry, it's not mine.
It's the company's.

644
00:42:44,726 --> 00:42:47,326
Yeah, I know you found it
a bit of a grind, didn't you?

645
00:42:47,366 --> 00:42:50,126
But I'm still circling the globe,
deluding myself.

646
00:42:50,206 --> 00:42:51,926
I just couldn't stand it.

647
00:42:52,006 --> 00:42:54,326
No. No, I heard you went into business.

648
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:56,606
I'm a wheel in an office,
if you can believe it.

649
00:42:56,686 --> 00:42:59,126
- A big wheel.
- It's who you know, Henry.

650
00:42:59,206 --> 00:43:01,726
I got involved with a woman.
Very nice.

651
00:43:01,806 --> 00:43:03,406
Family's got nothing but money.

652
00:43:03,486 --> 00:43:06,646
Big estate, servants, polo ponies.
All quite lovely.

653
00:43:06,726 --> 00:43:07,806
Hey, look, I understand.

654
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:10,566
It beats getting your heart broken
all the time by the top seeds.

655
00:43:10,646 --> 00:43:13,166
Isn't it amazing how much of life
turns on whether the ball

656
00:43:13,246 --> 00:43:14,726
goes over the net
or comes right back at you?

657
00:43:14,806 --> 00:43:16,726
I always admired
your game though, you know?

658
00:43:16,766 --> 00:43:18,206
- Thanks.
- You were very steady.

659
00:43:18,286 --> 00:43:19,886
Cool under pressure, but creative.

660
00:43:19,966 --> 00:43:22,126
You could be a poet
with the racket like Laver was.

661
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,606
I lost to you as much as I beat you.

662
00:43:23,686 --> 00:43:25,486
No. When I played you,
you never beat yourself.

663
00:43:25,566 --> 00:43:27,566
I'm telling you, a couple
of bounces the other way,

664
00:43:27,606 --> 00:43:29,926
you might've beaten
some of those top seeds.

665
00:43:30,006 --> 00:43:31,286
Listen, can I buy you lunch?

666
00:43:31,366 --> 00:43:33,046
That's...
What about next time I'm in town?

667
00:43:33,126 --> 00:43:34,806
- Give me your number.
- Certainly.

668
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:37,886
I'm moving into a new flat,
so this is my business card.

669
00:43:37,966 --> 00:43:40,286
- You should call me anytime.
- Very impressive.

670
00:43:40,366 --> 00:43:41,526
So good to see you, Henry.

671
00:43:41,606 --> 00:43:42,966
- You look well.
- And you, mate.

672
00:43:43,046 --> 00:43:44,406
- You look very, very well.
- I can buy us lunch.

673
00:43:44,486 --> 00:43:46,526
- Put it on the expense account, so...
- Very well.

674
00:43:46,606 --> 00:43:47,686
...do call.
- Very good. Yeah, yeah.

675
00:43:47,726 --> 00:43:49,606
- All right.
- Bye.

676
00:43:49,686 --> 00:43:51,046
- Oh, my God.
- Right there.

677
00:43:51,126 --> 00:43:54,366
- She's got glasses on.
- But why on earth?

678
00:43:54,446 --> 00:43:56,446
Why on earth would
your mother invite her here?

679
00:43:56,526 --> 00:43:59,046
She met her at the supermarket
yesterday and invited her...

680
00:43:59,126 --> 00:44:00,126
- The supermarket?
- Yes.

681
00:44:00,206 --> 00:44:02,446
- Can you play the piano?
- No, I'm terrible at the piano.

682
00:44:02,526 --> 00:44:04,566
- So, when are you two getting married?
- Mummy!

683
00:44:04,646 --> 00:44:06,606
- Oh, gosh, Eleanor!
- Oh, don't look so surprised.

684
00:44:06,646 --> 00:44:07,646
Stop it.

685
00:44:07,726 --> 00:44:09,806
You've been like two peas
in a pod for a long time now.

686
00:44:09,886 --> 00:44:11,646
Don't tell me the subject
hasn't come up.

687
00:44:11,726 --> 00:44:12,966
- Mummy, come with me.
- Oh, dear.

688
00:44:13,046 --> 00:44:16,446
You need a strong cup of coffee.
Come on.

689
00:44:16,526 --> 00:44:18,806
Eleanor doesn't hold back
when she's had a few.

690
00:44:18,886 --> 00:44:21,926
Look, it's a reasonable question.
Chloe and I have discussed it.

691
00:44:22,006 --> 00:44:24,246
Eleanor and I would be delighted
to welcome you to the family.

692
00:44:24,326 --> 00:44:25,726
Tom would love
having you as a brother-in-law,

693
00:44:25,766 --> 00:44:27,886
and whatever you two need,
you can always rely on us.

694
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:29,286
I appreciate that.

695
00:45:07,766 --> 00:45:09,926
Darling, one second.
I just think we...

696
00:45:14,246 --> 00:45:16,646
You two have met, haven't you?
I'm sure you've met.

697
00:45:16,726 --> 00:45:18,846
I'm sorry. Who'd have thought?

698
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:20,886
What, that we were
hiding in the pantry?

699
00:45:20,966 --> 00:45:22,326
It was all her fault, you know.

700
00:45:22,406 --> 00:45:25,166
Like, how can I help it if she
gets turned on by sexual intimacy

701
00:45:25,246 --> 00:45:27,246
in places that we know
we're gonna get caught?

702
00:45:27,326 --> 00:45:29,726
You were... You!
The risky business was your idea.

703
00:45:29,806 --> 00:45:31,846
All men who see you want to attack you.

704
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:35,126
Isn't that right, Christopher?

705
00:45:36,286 --> 00:45:37,766
Oh, God, are you all right?

706
00:45:38,646 --> 00:45:40,166
I'm fine.

707
00:45:40,246 --> 00:45:42,606
I shouldn't drink on an empty stomach.

708
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:48,566
I now pronounce you man and wife.

709
00:45:48,646 --> 00:45:50,686
You may kiss the bride.

710
00:46:06,646 --> 00:46:08,646
Oh, my God.

711
00:46:08,726 --> 00:46:10,966
- This is incredible.
- Isn't it?

712
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:14,006
- What's up here?
- That's the bedroom.

713
00:46:14,086 --> 00:46:16,046
There's another bedroom through there.

714
00:46:16,126 --> 00:46:18,086
The bathroom and a kitchen.

715
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:20,206
- Little terrace.
- Wow.

716
00:46:20,246 --> 00:46:23,326
- But look at this view.
- Oh, it's breathtaking.

717
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:27,046
- I just... wish I could afford it.
- Oh, don't bring that up again.

718
00:46:27,086 --> 00:46:29,086
You know it gives Papa pleasure to help.

719
00:46:30,566 --> 00:46:33,926
Come on.
The light coming through every day.

720
00:46:34,006 --> 00:46:36,166
It's beautiful. But it's huge!

721
00:46:36,246 --> 00:46:38,246
I'm gonna get lost in here or something.

722
00:46:41,046 --> 00:46:43,446
- Did I tell you I'm scared of heights?
- Really?

723
00:46:43,526 --> 00:46:45,526
- Yeah.
- That could be a problem.

724
00:46:47,286 --> 00:46:49,606
I want you to make me pregnant.

725
00:46:50,646 --> 00:46:54,006
Chloe... We discussed this.

726
00:46:54,046 --> 00:46:55,966
It's very quick.

727
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:59,126
It's not quick, we've been
sleeping together for ages.

728
00:46:59,886 --> 00:47:02,846
And I want three children,
and I want them when I'm young.

729
00:47:04,966 --> 00:47:07,966
Come on, you can do it,
you've got a powerful serve.

730
00:47:14,806 --> 00:47:17,406
Hey! Where are you?

731
00:47:18,726 --> 00:47:20,726
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

732
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:23,486
Not good.

733
00:47:25,446 --> 00:47:27,446
Listen, I've got to tell you something.

734
00:47:28,206 --> 00:47:29,646
What?

735
00:47:30,206 --> 00:47:32,126
Well, Nola and I...

736
00:47:32,206 --> 00:47:34,006
...broke up.

737
00:47:34,086 --> 00:47:36,246
- No!
- Yeah.

738
00:47:36,326 --> 00:47:38,606
Or, I should say, I called it off.

739
00:47:40,486 --> 00:47:42,286
I thought you were gonna get married.

740
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,526
Yeah, well,
it's rather embarrassing to say

741
00:47:44,566 --> 00:47:47,166
but I think Mother rather
poisoned the well on that one.

742
00:47:47,246 --> 00:47:50,366
Not that I have any intention
in marrying Olivia sodding Allred,

743
00:47:50,446 --> 00:47:52,086
who's her main candidate.

744
00:47:52,446 --> 00:47:54,006
God, no.

745
00:47:55,126 --> 00:47:57,926
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

746
00:47:58,926 --> 00:48:01,406
I suppose the whole truth,
nothing but the truth,

747
00:48:01,486 --> 00:48:03,886
so help me God,
part of the situation is, is that...

748
00:48:04,886 --> 00:48:06,886
...I've met someone else.

749
00:48:06,966 --> 00:48:09,006
- No!
- Yeah.

750
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:13,286
I met someone and I fell in love,
and I just knew right away.

751
00:48:13,366 --> 00:48:16,726
Although the fact that my mother
is in seventh heaven about her,

752
00:48:16,806 --> 00:48:20,086
I keep trying to tell myself
isn't a factor, but...

753
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:23,126
You know what I mean.

754
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:44,606
The number you are calling
is not available.

755
00:48:46,326 --> 00:48:48,926
The number you are calling
is not available.

756
00:49:05,246 --> 00:49:06,326
Excuse me.

757
00:49:06,406 --> 00:49:08,846
- Are you looking for Miss Rice?
- Yes.

758
00:49:08,926 --> 00:49:12,686
She's gone. Saw her yesterday.
She's given up the apartment.

759
00:49:15,366 --> 00:49:18,246
- Did she say where?
- Not to me.

760
00:49:19,566 --> 00:49:22,086
- Thanks.
- That's all right.

761
00:49:29,246 --> 00:49:31,966
- What are you thinking about?
- Nothing.

762
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:34,806
Just business.

763
00:49:39,166 --> 00:49:41,926
You know it's been over a week
since we made love.

764
00:49:42,006 --> 00:49:44,486
Oh, Chloe, I'm beat.

765
00:49:45,966 --> 00:49:48,686
- Am I being rejected?
- Of course not.

766
00:49:49,566 --> 00:49:51,806
OK, I can take a hint.

767
00:49:56,046 --> 00:50:00,486
Meanwhile, I don't know what's wrong.
All my cousins get pregnant so easily.

768
00:50:00,566 --> 00:50:01,966
Look...

769
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:04,366
...it'll happen.

770
00:50:04,446 --> 00:50:06,886
I'm just really tired.

771
00:50:07,566 --> 00:50:09,326
Kiss.

772
00:50:14,246 --> 00:50:15,806
Sweet dreams.

773
00:50:21,086 --> 00:50:24,046
I now pronounce you man and wife.

774
00:50:24,126 --> 00:50:26,246
You may kiss the bride.

775
00:50:36,526 --> 00:50:40,406
Just in time.
I'm almost starting to show.

776
00:50:43,406 --> 00:50:43,446
Well, you have
to see a fertility doctor.

777
00:50:43,446 --> 00:50:45,406
Well, you have
to see a fertility doctor.

778
00:50:45,446 --> 00:50:46,646
I know.

779
00:50:46,726 --> 00:50:50,006
- We've tried everything.
- What about this?

780
00:50:50,086 --> 00:50:53,086
His brushstrokes are really intense,
aren't they?

781
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:55,166
- Yeah, I don't like it.
- No.

782
00:50:55,246 --> 00:50:58,686
- Would you ever consider adopting?
- No, absolutely not.

783
00:50:58,726 --> 00:51:00,726
I want my own children.

784
00:51:01,286 --> 00:51:02,606
This one?

785
00:51:04,006 --> 00:51:05,006
Sort of...

786
00:51:05,086 --> 00:51:07,526
Did I tell you Victoria Phyfe
is pregnant?

787
00:51:07,566 --> 00:51:08,766
Really?

788
00:51:08,846 --> 00:51:10,766
- She's so happy.
- Whoa.

789
00:51:10,806 --> 00:51:12,846
Her and her husband
just found each other.

790
00:51:12,926 --> 00:51:15,886
All their neuroses
intertwine so perfectly,

791
00:51:15,966 --> 00:51:17,966
and it just works like a charm.

792
00:51:18,046 --> 00:51:22,246
After all their unhappy relationships,
they met during a traffic accident.

793
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:25,086
- God...
- I know, it's great.

794
00:51:25,886 --> 00:51:28,166
Well, our lawyers
are going over it as we speak.

795
00:51:28,886 --> 00:51:31,806
You'll have a daft by Friday. I promise.

796
00:51:31,886 --> 00:51:33,966
If I have to work all night.

797
00:51:34,046 --> 00:51:35,046
OK.

798
00:51:35,126 --> 00:51:37,246
Thank you. Thanks.

799
00:51:49,766 --> 00:51:52,006
Samantha,
can I have two aspirin, please?

800
00:51:59,886 --> 00:52:01,126
Thanks.

801
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:04,686
Are you OK, sir?

802
00:52:07,126 --> 00:52:10,566
Tell me, Samantha,
do you ever feel claustrophobic in here?

803
00:52:11,766 --> 00:52:14,326
No, not really.

804
00:52:17,886 --> 00:52:18,886
Oh, Christ!

805
00:52:18,966 --> 00:52:20,966
I've got to meet my wife
at the Tate Modern.

806
00:52:21,006 --> 00:52:23,046
There's a new painter
she wants to show me.

807
00:52:23,126 --> 00:52:25,406
If they call back, Samantha,
tell them Friday.

808
00:52:25,446 --> 00:52:27,006
Not before.

809
00:52:27,086 --> 00:52:28,846
Good night.

810
00:53:21,086 --> 00:53:24,086
- Chris.
- Oh, I was looking for you.

811
00:53:24,166 --> 00:53:25,966
- Hi, Carol.
- Hi, Chris.

812
00:53:26,046 --> 00:53:27,526
- How are you, darling?
- Good.

813
00:53:27,606 --> 00:53:29,846
They've got the most
amazing new artists here.

814
00:53:29,926 --> 00:53:30,926
Yeah?

815
00:53:31,006 --> 00:53:32,766
I want you to see
this woman from St. Ives.

816
00:53:32,846 --> 00:53:34,726
- Oh, yes.
- Look, where are you going to be?

817
00:53:34,806 --> 00:53:35,806
Why?

818
00:53:35,846 --> 00:53:38,766
I have to make a phone call,
and I can't get any reception down here.

819
00:53:38,846 --> 00:53:41,526
Well, we'll be over there.
But hurry, 'cause they're closing soon.

820
00:53:41,606 --> 00:53:42,606
I'm coming.

821
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:44,246
- OK.
- OK.

822
00:54:44,126 --> 00:54:45,526
Hello.

823
00:54:47,086 --> 00:54:48,766
What a surprise.

824
00:54:48,846 --> 00:54:50,166
I...

825
00:54:50,246 --> 00:54:54,006
- I moved back into town.
- I didn't know you'd left town.

826
00:54:54,086 --> 00:54:57,766
Yeah, I was really upset
about everything that happened,

827
00:54:57,846 --> 00:55:00,446
so I just went back to America
to look for a job.

828
00:55:00,766 --> 00:55:04,766
- I thought you hated that place?
- Anyplace but here.

829
00:55:06,246 --> 00:55:08,006
I looked for you.

830
00:55:08,686 --> 00:55:09,966
For what?

831
00:55:11,086 --> 00:55:13,086
You're still so angry.

832
00:55:16,406 --> 00:55:18,086
Where are you living?

833
00:55:18,926 --> 00:55:21,446
In town. Why?

834
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:24,406
You live alone?

835
00:55:24,486 --> 00:55:28,006
Why are you asking me these questions,
aren't you still married?

836
00:55:29,486 --> 00:55:31,486
Can I meet you for a drink?

837
00:55:31,566 --> 00:55:33,406
Talk?

838
00:55:35,006 --> 00:55:37,846
Where can I reach you? Come on.

839
00:55:37,926 --> 00:55:41,086
- My goodness. Hello.
- Hi, darling.

840
00:55:41,166 --> 00:55:43,206
Look who I bumped into.

841
00:55:43,286 --> 00:55:45,446
- Hi.
- Hi.

842
00:55:45,526 --> 00:55:48,086
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

843
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:50,446
- You look great.
- Thanks.

844
00:55:51,086 --> 00:55:53,206
- How's Tom?
- He's fine.

845
00:55:53,286 --> 00:55:56,406
- Really well.
- Yeah, I heard he got married.

846
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:59,086
Yeah. They've got a baby.

847
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:01,286
You know Tom, all settled down.

848
00:56:01,366 --> 00:56:03,966
- OK, I think I've found it.
- Do you two know each other?

849
00:56:04,046 --> 00:56:06,366
This is my friend Carol.
This is Nola.

850
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,686
- Hi.
- Hi.

851
00:56:08,286 --> 00:56:11,246
We've been looking everywhere
for this video installation.

852
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:14,406
We can't find it at all.
Will you excuse us?

853
00:56:14,486 --> 00:56:16,806
I think it's
on the third floor, isn't it?

854
00:56:16,886 --> 00:56:19,646
Yeah. No, no, no.
I think it's back there.

855
00:56:19,726 --> 00:56:21,126
Say your phone number.

856
00:56:21,206 --> 00:56:24,566
- What's the point?
- Just say your phone number.

857
00:56:24,646 --> 00:56:26,286
- Chris...
- Please.

858
00:56:26,366 --> 00:56:28,446
Say your phone number.

859
00:56:32,566 --> 00:56:36,646
02079460996.

860
00:56:37,886 --> 00:56:39,606
I'll call you.

861
00:56:40,886 --> 00:56:41,886
Bye.

862
00:56:45,446 --> 00:56:47,446
I think he really knows
what he's doing.

863
00:56:47,526 --> 00:56:49,446
Didn't you get
a good feeling about him?

864
00:56:49,526 --> 00:56:52,206
To me, fertility doctors
are a cut above witch doctors.

865
00:56:52,246 --> 00:56:54,406
Oh, yeah.
Well, he's not like that last one.

866
00:56:54,766 --> 00:56:55,766
It's OK, John.

867
00:56:55,846 --> 00:56:57,646
I feel like it's gonna happen this time.

868
00:56:57,686 --> 00:56:59,446
You go ahead, I've got a few meetings.

869
00:56:59,526 --> 00:57:02,046
- I'll drop you.
- No, it's OK. It's nearby. I'll walk.

870
00:57:02,126 --> 00:57:03,286
- OK.
- See you at home.

871
00:57:03,366 --> 00:57:04,366
Bye.

872
00:57:37,926 --> 00:57:39,966
You have a very charming flat.

873
00:57:40,046 --> 00:57:42,846
The area's not as run-down
as you said it was.

874
00:57:45,006 --> 00:57:47,726
I was lucky to find it
on such short notice.

875
00:57:49,126 --> 00:57:50,566
I mean, it's not perfect.

876
00:57:50,606 --> 00:57:53,606
The building's been burglarized
a couple of times and the...

877
00:57:53,646 --> 00:57:55,766
...woman down the hall has mice, but...

878
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:59,646
...you know, the lobby's decent.

879
00:58:00,286 --> 00:58:02,646
The key word is it's cheap.

880
00:58:03,966 --> 00:58:05,566
What time is it?

881
00:58:06,166 --> 00:58:07,766
Time for you to go.

882
00:58:09,326 --> 00:58:11,326
It's so hard to leave you.

883
00:58:15,606 --> 00:58:17,606
Beautiful woman.

884
00:58:22,806 --> 00:58:24,326
How'd you sleep?

885
00:58:25,486 --> 00:58:26,846
Good.

886
00:58:30,286 --> 00:58:32,686
God, did you see that stuff
on the news last night

887
00:58:32,766 --> 00:58:34,766
about that earthquake in China?

888
00:58:36,686 --> 00:58:38,366
Terrible.

889
00:58:40,486 --> 00:58:42,446
And there was this whole thing
about how they've discovered

890
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:45,446
- an entirely new planet.
- Yeah?

891
00:58:45,526 --> 00:58:46,926
Yeah.

892
00:58:59,606 --> 00:59:02,686
I went looking for space to rent
for the new gallery yesterday.

893
00:59:02,766 --> 00:59:05,126
Papa's getting so into the idea.

894
00:59:05,406 --> 00:59:07,366
It should be good for you.

895
00:59:09,286 --> 00:59:11,726
- I've got to go to work.
- Oh, really?

896
00:59:13,286 --> 00:59:16,046
I was kind of hoping we might,
you know...

897
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:18,086
...before you went to work.

898
00:59:18,646 --> 00:59:21,246
It's my time of the month,
and remember the doctor said

899
00:59:21,326 --> 00:59:24,766
we really should try and do it as often
as we possibly can in the morning.

900
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:29,766
- Darling, I'm gonna be late.
- Come on, it'll be fun.

901
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:32,486
Wait, I've got
to take my temperature first.

902
00:59:45,326 --> 00:59:47,806
So, you wanna meet
the same time next week?

903
00:59:47,886 --> 00:59:49,326
Let me come up.

904
00:59:49,406 --> 00:59:52,286
We just spent an hour at the hotel.
Don't tell me that you...

905
00:59:52,326 --> 00:59:54,726
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
You drive me crazy.

906
00:59:58,006 --> 01:00:00,246
- You're gonna be late for work.
- I don't care.

907
01:00:03,286 --> 01:00:04,806
Come on.

908
01:00:10,126 --> 01:00:12,286
- Oh, Mrs. Eastby, hello.
- Oh, hello.

909
01:00:12,366 --> 01:00:14,726
Hey, did you get that pest control?

910
01:00:14,766 --> 01:00:15,966
Oh, yes. Yes.

911
01:00:16,046 --> 01:00:18,486
The traps work better
with a little peanut butter.

912
01:00:18,566 --> 01:00:20,006
It's much better than cheese,

913
01:00:20,086 --> 01:00:22,406
despite the popular notion
that cheese is best.

914
01:00:22,486 --> 01:00:24,886
- Oh, this is Mr. Harris.
- Good afternoon. How are you?

915
01:00:24,966 --> 01:00:26,446
- Hello.
- Hello. Good to meet you.

916
01:00:26,526 --> 01:00:27,726
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.

917
01:00:27,806 --> 01:00:28,766
Bye.

918
01:01:01,486 --> 01:01:04,086
But I think that Bruton Street
would be perfect for the gallery

919
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:06,206
because it's just right
in the thick of things and...

920
01:01:06,286 --> 01:01:07,766
It'll just be a natural success,
I think,

921
01:01:07,846 --> 01:01:10,206
because you're great at picking out
paintings and bric-a-brac.

922
01:01:10,286 --> 01:01:11,526
Yeah.

923
01:01:11,606 --> 01:01:14,206
Knowing my luck,
I'll get pregnant the minute it opens.

924
01:01:14,286 --> 01:01:16,206
Yeah, well, you can manage both.
I mean...

925
01:01:16,286 --> 01:01:17,646
Heths didn't have a problem

926
01:01:17,726 --> 01:01:19,646
giving up Adair,
when we first had Rosie.

927
01:01:19,726 --> 01:01:21,686
Remember,
we did have a lot of help though.

928
01:01:21,766 --> 01:01:23,926
But the nanny left us.
She got a part in a movie.

929
01:01:24,006 --> 01:01:25,166
- No.
- Yeah.

930
01:01:25,246 --> 01:01:27,966
Actually, you know who we
bumped into the other day?

931
01:01:28,366 --> 01:01:30,966
- Obviously you know, but... Nola.
- Yeah.

932
01:01:31,006 --> 01:01:33,646
Well, I told you, we saw her.
When was it? Ages ago now.

933
01:01:33,726 --> 01:01:37,406
Yeah. Well, I think she's now working
in a boutique on Ledbury Road.

934
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:39,606
I think it's Paul and Joe's
or something.

935
01:01:39,686 --> 01:01:42,046
But she's just such an odd girl.

936
01:01:42,086 --> 01:01:44,966
I mean, she still looks great.
Sorry, but it's true.

937
01:01:45,846 --> 01:01:47,846
But something's just...

938
01:01:47,926 --> 01:01:50,606
...changed in her face.
I mean, I... We barely spoke.

939
01:01:50,686 --> 01:01:52,206
Tom said she looked a bit hard.

940
01:01:52,286 --> 01:01:55,446
Yeah, well, she's always, you know,
been a lady of the sauce, so to speak.

941
01:01:55,526 --> 01:01:57,286
And I think it kind of
runs in the family,

942
01:01:57,366 --> 01:01:59,486
but, I don't know...

943
01:02:00,246 --> 01:02:02,846
I mean she's still got
that "come-hither" look.

944
01:02:03,606 --> 01:02:07,006
- Is she going out with anyone?
- Strangely, I forgot to ask.

945
01:02:07,046 --> 01:02:09,126
But I'll keep you in touch with that,
Chloe, let you know.

946
01:02:09,206 --> 01:02:10,446
- Hello, Tom.
- Hello.

947
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:13,366
- Hello, fella.
- What are you doing here?

948
01:02:13,446 --> 01:02:16,286
We just popped in for a bit of,
you know, local tagliatelle.

949
01:02:16,326 --> 01:02:18,446
Good to see you.
What a lovely family gathering.

950
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:19,886
You should have told us.
We'd have made a sextet.

951
01:02:19,926 --> 01:02:20,926
A sextet.
We could have had one of those.

952
01:02:21,006 --> 01:02:23,086
- You guys going to Hedley next month?
- Yeah, we're gonna try. Aren't we?

953
01:02:23,126 --> 01:02:24,486
I know Tom's dying to get away.

954
01:02:24,526 --> 01:02:26,126
I was yelling at you the other day.
You didn't hear me.

955
01:02:26,206 --> 01:02:27,206
Me?

956
01:02:27,286 --> 01:02:30,366
Yeah, you were hailing a cab
on Melcombe Street about, what, 5:00.

957
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:33,526
- I'd have given you a lift.
- I was?

958
01:02:33,606 --> 01:02:35,366
- Where's Melcombe Street?
- No, not me.

959
01:02:35,406 --> 01:02:37,606
Yes, I mean it
certainly looked like you.

960
01:02:37,686 --> 01:02:40,726
- Where is Melcombe Street?
- No, I'm afraid you're mistaken.

961
01:02:40,806 --> 01:02:43,206
But people are always
taking me for other people. So...

962
01:02:43,246 --> 01:02:44,406
I'd have sworn it was you.

963
01:02:44,446 --> 01:02:46,606
Well, it certainly
wouldn't be Chris hailing a cab.

964
01:02:46,686 --> 01:02:48,566
He's completely dependant on our driver.

965
01:02:48,646 --> 01:02:49,886
- Quite right.
- Very annoying.

966
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:53,726
You should check for early Alzheimer's.
You're forgetting. I'm sure I'm right.

967
01:02:53,806 --> 01:02:56,966
No, you are mistaken.
But thank you for thinking of me.

968
01:02:57,046 --> 01:03:00,566
I think the only thing that comes out of
this conversation is you're both nuts.

969
01:03:00,646 --> 01:03:03,846
- Well, you're an authority on that.
- Or drunk. How dare you?

970
01:03:03,926 --> 01:03:05,286
Look, we'd better be going on.
Look, call me.

971
01:03:05,366 --> 01:03:06,726
- I will do.
- Enjoy your supper.

972
01:03:06,806 --> 01:03:07,926
- Bye. See you.
- Thanks.

973
01:03:08,006 --> 01:03:08,966
Nuts.

974
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:11,686
Good afternoon, Ingrid.

975
01:03:12,446 --> 01:03:14,606
Samantha, what do we have
for this afternoon?

976
01:03:14,686 --> 01:03:16,886
Just the Sarazin people at two.

977
01:03:16,966 --> 01:03:18,086
- Can we push it an hour?
- Yeah.

978
01:03:18,166 --> 01:03:21,406
I should be back in time, but if I'm
not, please make them comfortable.

979
01:03:25,486 --> 01:03:27,126
Chris. Where are you off to?

980
01:03:27,206 --> 01:03:29,286
I'm sorry, Rod,
I've got an appointment.

981
01:03:29,326 --> 01:03:31,526
We have Sarazin
and company this afternoon.

982
01:03:31,606 --> 01:03:34,526
I should be back in time but if I'm not,
please start without me.

983
01:03:34,646 --> 01:03:38,486
- Really?
- It's OK. It's important, trust me.

984
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:41,326
It's ridiculous to go back to my place.

985
01:03:41,406 --> 01:03:43,246
Once we get there,
you'll have less than an hour.

986
01:03:43,326 --> 01:03:45,806
Look, it's not that I'm
miserable with Chloe, it's just...

987
01:03:45,846 --> 01:03:47,366
I don't wanna talk about Chloe anymore!

988
01:03:47,446 --> 01:03:49,566
Listen, it's just I'm bored!
I mean, she's very nice, but...

989
01:03:49,646 --> 01:03:51,526
- Chris!
- Are you in a bad mood?

990
01:03:51,606 --> 01:03:54,006
Yes, I am in a bad mood.
I just blew another audition.

991
01:03:54,086 --> 01:03:56,446
I'm so sick of this acting thing,
it's just not working out.

992
01:03:56,486 --> 01:03:57,566
It's a hard field.

993
01:03:57,646 --> 01:04:00,126
- You have to keep plugging at it.
- I'm sick of plugging.

994
01:04:00,206 --> 01:04:03,046
Tom's mother was right.
It just gets to a point, you know?

995
01:04:03,126 --> 01:04:04,886
Or should I say your mother-in-law?

996
01:04:04,926 --> 01:04:07,926
Hey, look.
Let's not go into one of those, OK?

997
01:04:09,126 --> 01:04:13,046
I don't know what I'm doing with you.
You're never gonna leave Chloe.

998
01:04:14,766 --> 01:04:16,766
Maybe I will.

999
01:04:18,926 --> 01:04:21,246
Don't say that unless you mean it.

1000
01:04:22,766 --> 01:04:25,366
Chloe's just so desperate
to get pregnant.

1001
01:04:26,126 --> 01:04:28,486
I mean, it's... mechanical.

1002
01:04:32,686 --> 01:04:34,886
I don't know what I'd do
if I couldn't see you.

1003
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:39,206
Really. I mean it.

1004
01:04:42,046 --> 01:04:44,726
- Merry bloody Christmas.
- Lovely.

1005
01:04:44,766 --> 01:04:46,486
How many cigarettes
are you gonna smoke today?

1006
01:04:46,566 --> 01:04:48,766
- A million, at least.
- Please don't start smoking.

1007
01:04:48,806 --> 01:04:50,686
- Well, it is Christmas.
- It's such a pity.

1008
01:04:50,766 --> 01:04:51,926
- Come on, just a little one.
- It's gonna...

1009
01:04:52,006 --> 01:04:54,446
You think you're going
to be living forever, you're not.

1010
01:04:54,646 --> 01:04:56,166
Hi.

1011
01:04:56,246 --> 01:04:58,566
I wanted to wish you a merry Christmas.

1012
01:04:59,726 --> 01:05:02,166
I've been thinking about you.

1013
01:05:04,486 --> 01:05:07,886
I may be able to get away tomorrow,
for an hour or so.

1014
01:05:09,366 --> 01:05:11,806
OK. See you then.

1015
01:05:11,886 --> 01:05:13,446
Bye-bye.

1016
01:05:14,126 --> 01:05:16,006
There you are, Chris.

1017
01:05:16,086 --> 01:05:19,446
Chloe tells me you've sustained
some personal loss in the market

1018
01:05:19,526 --> 01:05:21,286
over the past few months.

1019
01:05:21,366 --> 01:05:24,286
Well, I guess I've been a little bit
careless, not concentrating.

1020
01:05:24,366 --> 01:05:26,166
And, of course,
I thought I made good decisions, but...

1021
01:05:26,246 --> 01:05:28,046
Well, who could have predicted these?

1022
01:05:28,126 --> 01:05:30,406
Look, I don't want
you and Chloe to worry.

1023
01:05:30,446 --> 01:05:33,326
- You'll always have a safety net.
- You're too generous, sir.

1024
01:05:33,406 --> 01:05:34,926
Oh, no, you've made Chloe happy,

1025
01:05:35,006 --> 01:05:37,046
and that means a great deal
to Eleanor and me.

1026
01:06:38,246 --> 01:06:42,206
Well, I think it's gonna be
an amazing holiday. Don't you, Chris?

1027
01:06:42,286 --> 01:06:43,646
Yes.

1028
01:06:43,686 --> 01:06:47,406
We have a choice of sleeping
on the boat or in the different hotels.

1029
01:06:47,486 --> 01:06:48,446
- Boat.
- Boat.

1030
01:06:48,526 --> 01:06:49,726
- Every time.
- Good. I say the boat.

1031
01:06:49,806 --> 01:06:51,166
Do you know he's never been
to the Greek Islands.

1032
01:06:51,246 --> 01:06:52,486
- What?
- No.

1033
01:06:52,566 --> 01:06:54,086
- No, he's never been.
- You'll love it.

1034
01:06:54,166 --> 01:06:57,006
No. I have been to Athens,
but I hear the Islands are paradise.

1035
01:06:57,086 --> 01:06:58,086
Oh, that reminds me,

1036
01:06:58,166 --> 01:07:00,606
we have to go to Sardinia to
pop in on Brook and Dougie Winston.

1037
01:07:00,686 --> 01:07:01,686
- Oh, good.
- Oh, God.

1038
01:07:01,766 --> 01:07:04,286
- No, no, the house is beautiful.
- Brook's fine, Dougie's a nightmare.

1039
01:07:04,366 --> 01:07:06,206
Sounds so romantic, doesn't it?
Mikonos and Crete.

1040
01:07:06,246 --> 01:07:07,246
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1041
01:07:07,326 --> 01:07:09,846
I'm so anxious to see all the
beautiful old temples and theaters.

1042
01:07:09,926 --> 01:07:10,926
Oh, God.

1043
01:07:11,006 --> 01:07:12,446
Yeah. Oh, I'll do that with you.
Tom can stay...

1044
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:15,486
You know, I bought Chris
an ancient Greek fertility charm.

1045
01:07:15,526 --> 01:07:17,406
- Do you remember?
- I'll never forget.

1046
01:07:17,486 --> 01:07:19,166
I sent off for that fertility thingy.

1047
01:07:19,246 --> 01:07:22,166
He had to put it under
his pillow for two months.

1048
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:25,246
And absolutely nothing happened,
of course.

1049
01:07:25,326 --> 01:07:26,286
Poor thing.

1050
01:07:26,366 --> 01:07:28,966
- I'd just subjected him to the torture.
- They think he's firing blanks.

1051
01:07:29,046 --> 01:07:30,046
- Oh, shut up!
- Hello?

1052
01:07:30,126 --> 01:07:31,806
I miss you.

1053
01:07:32,366 --> 01:07:34,606
- Love me. Just love me.
- No, because it's not funny.

1054
01:07:34,686 --> 01:07:36,166
- It's not funny.
- I'm sorry.

1055
01:07:36,206 --> 01:07:38,366
Proof is in the pudding,
and there ain't been any pudding.

1056
01:07:38,446 --> 01:07:40,526
- I can't get away right now.
- Well, you have to.

1057
01:07:40,606 --> 01:07:42,206
When can you get here?

1058
01:07:43,406 --> 01:07:45,646
Tomorrow. No, Monday.

1059
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:47,046
Look...

1060
01:07:47,726 --> 01:07:49,446
It's a three-day weekend.

1061
01:07:49,726 --> 01:07:51,286
Tuesday.

1062
01:07:51,846 --> 01:07:53,846
Chris, I need to see you.

1063
01:07:55,006 --> 01:07:57,686
I'll see what I can do.
I'll call you right back.

1064
01:07:57,766 --> 01:08:00,206
I would love to meet Barbra Streisand.

1065
01:08:00,286 --> 01:08:03,246
She's meant to be really lovely.
She's with that other American fella.

1066
01:08:03,326 --> 01:08:04,886
- Who was that?
- Oh, I'm such an idiot.

1067
01:08:04,966 --> 01:08:07,366
I forgot to sign some papers.
I may have to drive into town.

1068
01:08:07,406 --> 01:08:08,406
Jack Garner?

1069
01:08:08,486 --> 01:08:10,526
You can't go,
it's a bank holiday weekend.

1070
01:08:10,606 --> 01:08:11,886
The traffic'll be terrible.

1071
01:08:11,966 --> 01:08:14,366
- James Garner, that's it.
- I mean, we've all got plans.

1072
01:08:14,446 --> 01:08:15,406
I don't mean today.

1073
01:08:15,486 --> 01:08:17,166
They named their little dog
after Elaine Paige.

1074
01:08:17,246 --> 01:08:18,566
Well, surely it can wait
a couple of days.

1075
01:08:18,646 --> 01:08:20,446
- Why did they do that?
- 'Cause it howls all night long.

1076
01:08:20,526 --> 01:08:22,046
- Yes, I'm sure it can.
- Oh, that's mean.

1077
01:08:22,126 --> 01:08:23,886
I know. And it's
terribly small and furry.

1078
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:24,966
That's mean.

1079
01:08:25,526 --> 01:08:28,046
I think tomorrow
we should go for a morning ride.

1080
01:08:28,126 --> 01:08:29,606
I've some lovely new horses.

1081
01:08:29,686 --> 01:08:31,286
Do you remember when
Chris came here first,

1082
01:08:31,326 --> 01:08:33,326
and he had some
serious qualms about riding?

1083
01:08:33,366 --> 01:08:34,486
- I spoke to Teddy.
- How is he?

1084
01:08:34,566 --> 01:08:36,366
Well, this morning he was talking
about buying a horse of his own.

1085
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,046
- No.
- Yeah.

1086
01:08:38,126 --> 01:08:39,646
I don't know, it was all in good fun.

1087
01:08:39,726 --> 01:08:40,846
- Where from?
- Anyway...

1088
01:08:40,926 --> 01:08:43,326
- I think Nan's got a really nice mare.
...he's a wonderful new horse.

1089
01:08:43,406 --> 01:08:46,206
Telephone call, sir.
She said it was important.

1090
01:08:49,286 --> 01:08:50,806
Excuse me.

1091
01:08:52,126 --> 01:08:54,126
- Tomorrow morning?
- Do you wanna come?

1092
01:08:54,206 --> 01:08:56,886
That bloody phone
has not stopped ringing all weekend.

1093
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:59,006
- I know.
- It's so irritating.

1094
01:08:59,446 --> 01:09:00,446
Hello?

1095
01:09:00,526 --> 01:09:02,686
I tried to call your mobile,
but it's off.

1096
01:09:03,166 --> 01:09:05,126
Are you mad calling me here?

1097
01:09:05,726 --> 01:09:07,366
When are you coming over?

1098
01:09:07,446 --> 01:09:09,446
I'm trying to make it for tomorrow.

1099
01:09:09,526 --> 01:09:11,606
I can't wait till tomorrow,
I'm going crazy.

1100
01:09:11,686 --> 01:09:14,526
- What the hell's the matter?
- I'm pregnant.

1101
01:09:20,686 --> 01:09:22,686
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1102
01:09:22,766 --> 01:09:25,246
'Cause we've got to go
and try and look at this...

1103
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:28,406
...horse for Chris.
- They got it in the navy?

1104
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:32,086
Yeah, the... It was lack of enough
vegetables, or something.

1105
01:09:32,166 --> 01:09:34,686
I wonder if that's why they took
lemons and oranges...

1106
01:09:34,766 --> 01:09:36,086
Well, they only had biscuits.

1107
01:09:36,166 --> 01:09:38,526
Well, that's where
Rose's Lime Cordial originated...

1108
01:09:38,606 --> 01:09:42,366
- Who keeps calling?
- It was Samantha, my secretary.

1109
01:09:42,446 --> 01:09:45,566
I'm afraid I won't be able
to go riding tomorrow. I can't help it.

1110
01:09:45,646 --> 01:09:47,926
I thought Samantha said she was
going to her parents this weekend.

1111
01:09:48,006 --> 01:09:50,246
I know, it's all my fault. Poor girl.

1112
01:09:51,166 --> 01:09:52,486
It's no big deal.

1113
01:09:52,566 --> 01:09:53,726
I'll pop back into town.

1114
01:09:53,846 --> 01:09:57,806
The whole thing'll take a few hours,
and it'll be off my mind. I promise.

1115
01:09:57,886 --> 01:09:59,566
- That's a shame.
- It's really sad.

1116
01:09:59,646 --> 01:10:01,246
Well, it is a pity because I...

1117
01:10:01,326 --> 01:10:03,526
I think it's unfair
on Samantha too, frankly.

1118
01:10:03,606 --> 01:10:04,966
Yeah. Well, it's unfortunate,

1119
01:10:05,046 --> 01:10:07,166
but, you know,
Chris has a lot of responsibility.

1120
01:10:07,246 --> 01:10:08,886
Well, anyway,
let's not worry about it. Let's...

1121
01:10:08,966 --> 01:10:10,446
- Slave driver.
- Look, as long as we make lamb bone.

1122
01:10:10,526 --> 01:10:11,526
- Can you, can you?
- Well, I think so.

1123
01:10:11,606 --> 01:10:11,686
- How the hell did you get pregnant?
- I told you that weekend last month

1124
01:10:11,686 --> 01:10:14,366
- How the hell did you get pregnant?
- I told you that weekend last month

1125
01:10:14,446 --> 01:10:16,246
that we needed to be careful
and I didn't have protection,

1126
01:10:16,326 --> 01:10:17,886
but you couldn't wait.

1127
01:10:19,806 --> 01:10:21,686
What unbelievable bad luck.

1128
01:10:21,766 --> 01:10:24,566
Christ, I can't get my wife pregnant
no matter how hard I try,

1129
01:10:24,606 --> 01:10:26,446
and the minute you're unprotected
I knock you up.

1130
01:10:26,526 --> 01:10:28,326
It's 'cause you love me,
and you don't love her.

1131
01:10:28,406 --> 01:10:29,406
Is that your interpretation?

1132
01:10:29,486 --> 01:10:31,566
It's a child conceived
out of genuine passion,

1133
01:10:31,646 --> 01:10:34,206
not as part of some fertility project.

1134
01:10:34,286 --> 01:10:36,206
OK. Well I'll go with you,
and we'll get it sorted.

1135
01:10:36,286 --> 01:10:38,046
- I'm not doing that again.
- Again?

1136
01:10:38,086 --> 01:10:40,646
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's the third time.

1137
01:10:40,726 --> 01:10:43,246
I did it once when I was younger,
and then I did it for Tom.

1138
01:10:43,326 --> 01:10:45,126
I didn't want to, but he insisted.

1139
01:10:45,206 --> 01:10:47,166
Nola, I really can't see any other way.

1140
01:10:47,246 --> 01:10:49,246
- Why can't I just have it?
- And what?

1141
01:10:49,326 --> 01:10:52,246
- And we'll raise it together.
- That's obviously not possible.

1142
01:10:52,326 --> 01:10:54,286
Why? You hate your job,
you hate your life.

1143
01:10:54,366 --> 01:10:57,046
I mean, it seems like a blessing.
It's a sign.

1144
01:10:57,126 --> 01:10:58,806
Look, Nola, I have to go.

1145
01:10:58,886 --> 01:11:00,846
I'm juggling six things
at the same time

1146
01:11:00,926 --> 01:11:03,486
just to make
this trip to the city look legit.

1147
01:11:05,086 --> 01:11:06,446
I'll talk to you on Tuesday.

1148
01:11:06,526 --> 01:11:07,766
Chris...

1149
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:10,966
You must... I expect you
to do the right thing, OK?

1150
01:11:11,046 --> 01:11:13,566
I'm not walking away from this.

1151
01:11:15,206 --> 01:11:18,166
Is anything the matter?
You seemed very gloomy all weekend.

1152
01:11:20,486 --> 01:11:23,606
- I wanted to talk to you.
- What about?

1153
01:11:24,606 --> 01:11:26,726
Us.

1154
01:11:27,206 --> 01:11:29,166
Is something wrong?

1155
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:33,406
Yeah. There is.

1156
01:11:34,886 --> 01:11:35,886
What?

1157
01:11:35,966 --> 01:11:39,006
If you're still taking a hammering
financially in the market,

1158
01:11:39,086 --> 01:11:40,566
you know it's not a problem.

1159
01:11:41,086 --> 01:11:43,766
I can't keep leaning
on your father, Chloe.

1160
01:11:44,886 --> 01:11:48,166
Papa gets more pleasure
out of helping his family,

1161
01:11:48,246 --> 01:11:51,766
than all the possessions he owns.
You know that.

1162
01:11:54,766 --> 01:11:56,526
What is it?

1163
01:12:01,046 --> 01:12:04,406
Is it something to do
with those phone calls you kept getting?

1164
01:12:05,526 --> 01:12:08,766
Because you acted
really strangely after each of them.

1165
01:12:13,126 --> 01:12:15,526
Are you having an affair?

1166
01:12:16,486 --> 01:12:18,726
Am I having an affair?

1167
01:12:18,806 --> 01:12:20,886
Yeah, that's what I asked.

1168
01:12:22,926 --> 01:12:25,286
- No.
- You are.

1169
01:12:25,326 --> 01:12:27,526
Of course I'm not. Don't be silly.

1170
01:12:38,326 --> 01:12:40,846
Do you not love me anymore?

1171
01:12:43,046 --> 01:12:45,246
Of course I love you.

1172
01:12:46,486 --> 01:12:48,646
Well, what's wrong?

1173
01:12:51,846 --> 01:12:54,086
I just feel like I'm letting you down.

1174
01:12:54,126 --> 01:12:56,166
You're not. How?

1175
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:01,806
Is it because I'm not getting pregnant?

1176
01:13:05,126 --> 01:13:07,126
I just...

1177
01:13:07,766 --> 01:13:10,166
...feel so guilty.

1178
01:13:10,966 --> 01:13:13,686
So terribly guilty.

1179
01:13:13,766 --> 01:13:16,086
Listen, Chris.

1180
01:13:16,166 --> 01:13:19,606
We've both been to the doctor.
We're both perfectly healthy.

1181
01:13:19,686 --> 01:13:24,126
I can conceive and you're perfectly
capable of making a woman pregnant.

1182
01:13:25,806 --> 01:13:30,086
Is it me? Have I been horribly pushy
and obnoxious on the subject?

1183
01:13:30,966 --> 01:13:35,806
Look, I... I just want a baby.
I want to have our baby.

1184
01:13:37,766 --> 01:13:40,486
We haven't been lucky yet, that's all.

1185
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,646
Oh, Chloe.

1186
01:13:51,606 --> 01:13:53,846
Let's get off the subject.

1187
01:13:53,886 --> 01:13:57,886
Having a child should be something
that makes us both happy and excited,

1188
01:13:57,966 --> 01:14:01,726
not a cause of all this
tension and anxiety and...

1189
01:14:05,366 --> 01:14:07,366
I had to talk to somebody.

1190
01:14:08,646 --> 01:14:10,006
I'm really suffering.

1191
01:14:10,086 --> 01:14:13,166
Whatever you tell me goes no further.

1192
01:14:14,406 --> 01:14:17,406
I'm contemplating leaving my wife
for another woman.

1193
01:14:18,806 --> 01:14:20,766
But when the time came to tell her...

1194
01:14:21,806 --> 01:14:23,406
...I couldn't do it.

1195
01:14:23,486 --> 01:14:25,966
Yeah, well, it's not the easiest
thing in the world to do, is it?

1196
01:14:28,126 --> 01:14:29,806
It's crazy.

1197
01:14:31,086 --> 01:14:33,806
I can see no real future
with this other woman.

1198
01:14:33,966 --> 01:14:36,246
And I have a very
comfortable life with my wife.

1199
01:14:36,326 --> 01:14:39,646
- Yeah, but if you don't love her...
- I'm not saying I don't love her.

1200
01:14:39,726 --> 01:14:42,326
Just not in the way I feel
about this other woman.

1201
01:14:42,366 --> 01:14:44,086
Right.

1202
01:14:44,806 --> 01:14:47,966
Maybe it's finally the difference
between love and lust.

1203
01:14:48,086 --> 01:14:50,566
But what the hell
am I going to do if I leave Chloe?

1204
01:14:52,846 --> 01:14:56,486
I don't fool myself that I haven't
gotten used to a certain kind of living.

1205
01:14:56,566 --> 01:14:59,966
Am I supposed to give it all up?
For what?

1206
01:15:00,646 --> 01:15:02,206
Is it for a woman you love?

1207
01:15:02,286 --> 01:15:05,006
To live how? Where?

1208
01:15:05,286 --> 01:15:08,286
- To work as what?
- Well, it seems to me that you...

1209
01:15:08,326 --> 01:15:10,246
You're pretty good
at what you're doing.

1210
01:15:10,326 --> 01:15:13,406
There must be another job in another
firm that you can just, you know...

1211
01:15:13,486 --> 01:15:16,526
Let's face it,
I'm the boss's son-in-law.

1212
01:15:16,606 --> 01:15:18,726
And he loves me.

1213
01:15:19,846 --> 01:15:22,326
Doesn't seem to me like you
want this other woman enough

1214
01:15:22,406 --> 01:15:24,966
to give up everything
you've achieved for it.

1215
01:15:25,606 --> 01:15:27,846
We're going away for three weeks.

1216
01:15:27,926 --> 01:15:30,966
- When I get back I'll tell her.
- When you get back?

1217
01:15:32,006 --> 01:15:34,446
What am I supposed to do?
Stop playing games with me!

1218
01:15:34,486 --> 01:15:37,806
- I'm not playing games with you.
- Why don't you just tell her now then?

1219
01:15:37,886 --> 01:15:40,046
I'd think you'd want
to stop living such a sham.

1220
01:15:40,126 --> 01:15:43,126
- Look, it's not easy.
- Why not?

1221
01:15:43,166 --> 01:15:46,206
If you're so bored at home with her
and you're so crazy about me,

1222
01:15:46,286 --> 01:15:47,686
which is all you ever tell me...

1223
01:15:47,766 --> 01:15:50,526
I don't wanna mess
this holiday up for everybody, OK?

1224
01:15:51,806 --> 01:15:53,806
It's a big blow.

1225
01:15:53,846 --> 01:15:56,006
And it's gonna make
a huge impact on everyone.

1226
01:15:56,086 --> 01:15:59,446
How can you go on vacation with a
woman that you know you're gonna leave

1227
01:15:59,526 --> 01:16:01,606
- the minute you get back?
- Keep your voice down.

1228
01:16:01,686 --> 01:16:04,286
You wanna know how I feel?
I'm jealous, OK?

1229
01:16:04,366 --> 01:16:06,446
I don't like the idea
of you making love with her.

1230
01:16:06,526 --> 01:16:10,766
I don't like the idea of you going off
island-hopping with her. It's romantic!

1231
01:16:10,846 --> 01:16:12,846
Hey, keep your voice down.

1232
01:16:13,846 --> 01:16:16,086
You know I make love to her.

1233
01:16:16,126 --> 01:16:18,646
And you know it's just routine.

1234
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:22,126
For God's sakes,
can't you wait a few weeks?

1235
01:16:24,526 --> 01:16:26,126
Yeah.

1236
01:16:27,446 --> 01:16:30,286
I just wanna know that
something's gonna happen, you know?

1237
01:16:30,366 --> 01:16:32,006
It will.

1238
01:16:33,366 --> 01:16:35,566
- It will.
- OK.

1239
01:16:40,246 --> 01:16:42,006
The holiday's off.

1240
01:16:42,086 --> 01:16:43,526
Why? What happened?

1241
01:16:43,606 --> 01:16:45,766
Maurice Lewis has
to go in for an operation.

1242
01:16:46,766 --> 01:16:48,006
Why?

1243
01:16:48,086 --> 01:16:50,486
Disc in his back or something.
He can't walk.

1244
01:16:50,526 --> 01:16:52,326
Anyway, he needs recovery time

1245
01:16:52,406 --> 01:16:55,646
and everyone thought we should
just move it till after the summer.

1246
01:16:55,726 --> 01:16:57,166
Let me just pack up my stuff.

1247
01:16:57,246 --> 01:16:59,806
We should probably walk to the opera,
it's so close.

1248
01:16:59,886 --> 01:17:01,566
Yeah.

1249
01:17:17,606 --> 01:17:18,646
Hello?

1250
01:17:31,646 --> 01:17:33,646
Hello?

1251
01:17:49,846 --> 01:17:51,686
An opportunity has arisen, Chris,

1252
01:17:51,726 --> 01:17:53,726
which I think may be
a lucrative one for you.

1253
01:17:53,806 --> 01:17:54,806
Really?

1254
01:17:54,886 --> 01:17:56,886
We're structuring something
with a Japanese company.

1255
01:17:56,966 --> 01:18:00,086
It's an independent operation. There's
a great deal of money to be made.

1256
01:18:00,206 --> 01:18:04,566
And my thought was, anyone in on the
ground floor stands to profit hugely,

1257
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:06,886
assuming our predictions are correct.

1258
01:18:06,966 --> 01:18:08,366
- Sounds exciting.
- It is.

1259
01:18:08,406 --> 01:18:11,406
Eleanor. I've just
told Chris the good news.

1260
01:18:11,486 --> 01:18:14,406
But what would make me the happiest
has nothing to do with money.

1261
01:18:14,446 --> 01:18:16,526
I'd like you to make me
a young grandmother.

1262
01:18:16,606 --> 01:18:18,606
You already are a young grandmother.

1263
01:18:18,646 --> 01:18:20,926
Yes. Tom and Heather
are trying for their second,

1264
01:18:21,006 --> 01:18:23,006
but I'd like you to be a mother.

1265
01:18:23,086 --> 01:18:25,286
Oh, all right.
Don't look at me like that.

1266
01:18:25,366 --> 01:18:28,526
I'll be quiet. What would you
like for your birthday?

1267
01:18:28,606 --> 01:18:30,326
- I don't know.
- Your birthday?

1268
01:18:30,406 --> 01:18:32,366
Great. You forgot.

1269
01:18:32,446 --> 01:18:35,086
I didn't actually.
I bought you something already.

1270
01:18:35,166 --> 01:18:36,846
So my hints worked.

1271
01:18:37,926 --> 01:18:40,006
- Mummy...
- I knew. I knew.

1272
01:18:40,086 --> 01:18:41,086
- We are trying. We don't want to...
- All right.

1273
01:18:41,166 --> 01:18:43,406
- Hello?
- Chris?

1274
01:18:43,486 --> 01:18:44,726
- Excuse me.
- By all means.

1275
01:18:44,806 --> 01:18:46,286
- I weigh as much as I did.
- Yes, darling.

1276
01:18:46,366 --> 01:18:47,966
- Look, please relax, OK?
- I spoke out of turn.

1277
01:18:48,046 --> 01:18:49,606
- Hey. Hey.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1278
01:18:49,726 --> 01:18:51,006
- What are you two bickering about?
- Nothing.

1279
01:18:51,046 --> 01:18:53,326
I told you not to call me, I'd call you.

1280
01:18:53,486 --> 01:18:55,966
Well, I... I...
I was waiting for you to call.

1281
01:18:56,046 --> 01:18:57,366
I've been waiting a week.

1282
01:18:57,566 --> 01:19:00,326
Well, there's always
people around and I can't talk.

1283
01:19:00,806 --> 01:19:02,446
When are you coming home?

1284
01:19:02,606 --> 01:19:04,006
In about two weeks.

1285
01:19:04,086 --> 01:19:06,726
About two weeks? You said
the whole trip was three weeks!

1286
01:19:06,806 --> 01:19:08,166
Yeah, right. Three weeks.

1287
01:19:08,246 --> 01:19:10,046
Chris, Mummy and Papa are leaving.

1288
01:19:10,126 --> 01:19:12,006
OK. OK...

1289
01:19:12,166 --> 01:19:13,926
Who is that? What country are you in?

1290
01:19:14,006 --> 01:19:16,046
Your mobile's been impossible.

1291
01:19:16,406 --> 01:19:18,566
I told you. I'm in Greece.

1292
01:19:18,606 --> 01:19:21,086
And there's always people around,
so I can't talk.

1293
01:19:21,166 --> 01:19:23,766
I said I'd be home soon,
and I will call you.

1294
01:19:24,606 --> 01:19:26,766
I'm just lonely. I'm anxious.

1295
01:19:26,846 --> 01:19:28,246
Can you just?

1296
01:19:28,766 --> 01:19:30,886
Please tell Chloe
as soon as you get home.

1297
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:33,686
I just want this situation
to be resolved.

1298
01:19:34,246 --> 01:19:36,046
Do you miss me?

1299
01:19:36,126 --> 01:19:38,086
OK. Bye, bye.

1300
01:19:39,126 --> 01:19:41,366
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

1301
01:19:41,446 --> 01:19:43,166
- Are you leaving already?
- Yeah.

1302
01:20:09,766 --> 01:20:12,486
Chris, it's Nola.
Where have I reached you?

1303
01:20:12,966 --> 01:20:14,486
Sardinia.

1304
01:20:14,566 --> 01:20:16,846
I'll be back in five or six days, OK?

1305
01:20:27,526 --> 01:20:29,806
- Good morning, John.
- Oh, you're early, sir.

1306
01:20:29,846 --> 01:20:31,646
- I'll bring the car around.
- Yes.

1307
01:20:37,926 --> 01:20:39,006
You lied to me.

1308
01:20:39,086 --> 01:20:40,646
- Oh, Jesus.
- You lied to me!

1309
01:20:40,726 --> 01:20:42,206
- Quiet!
- I wanna see Chloe!

1310
01:20:42,286 --> 01:20:44,046
- Quiet, quiet.
- I wanna talk to Chloe.

1311
01:20:44,126 --> 01:20:45,086
Look, Christ, Christ.

1312
01:20:45,166 --> 01:20:46,366
No, no, no, listen.
Listen, I can explain.

1313
01:20:46,446 --> 01:20:47,686
I wanna talk to Chloe.
You're a liar! You're a liar!

1314
01:20:47,766 --> 01:20:48,926
I can explain. I... Taxi!

1315
01:20:48,966 --> 01:20:50,326
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Taxi!

1316
01:20:50,366 --> 01:20:52,606
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Calm down.

1317
01:20:52,686 --> 01:20:55,526
- Nola! Nola, calm down. Calm down.
- You're a liar! You're a liar!

1318
01:20:55,606 --> 01:20:57,086
I came home deliberately,
I came home early.

1319
01:20:57,166 --> 01:20:59,646
You're a liar! I wanna talk to Chloe.

1320
01:20:59,726 --> 01:21:02,326
- I wanna talk to Chloe!
- Calm down. Calm the fuck down!

1321
01:21:02,406 --> 01:21:06,246
I wanna talk to Chloe.
You liar! You're a liar!

1322
01:21:06,846 --> 01:21:08,246
You're a liar!

1323
01:21:12,166 --> 01:21:15,126
I decided to cut the trip short
because all this is eating away at me.

1324
01:21:15,206 --> 01:21:17,006
I only came back
the day before yesterday

1325
01:21:17,086 --> 01:21:19,246
because I need a week
in the city to deal with Chloe

1326
01:21:19,326 --> 01:21:22,126
- without you breathing down my neck.
- You're driving me crazy!

1327
01:21:22,206 --> 01:21:24,166
I don't know whether
to believe you or not.

1328
01:21:24,206 --> 01:21:26,006
- Please believe me, Nola.
- Well, did you tell her?

1329
01:21:26,086 --> 01:21:27,406
I was about to when you called.

1330
01:21:27,486 --> 01:21:28,526
What does that have to do with anything?

1331
01:21:28,606 --> 01:21:29,766
- I got flustered.
- Oh, please!

1332
01:21:29,846 --> 01:21:31,366
I was all set to tell her
and then you called,

1333
01:21:31,446 --> 01:21:33,486
and then I feel guilty about
telling you that I'm still in Greece.

1334
01:21:33,566 --> 01:21:36,206
- You said Sardinia.
- I... I was talking fast.

1335
01:21:36,286 --> 01:21:38,726
I... I didn't want her to know
what I was talking about.

1336
01:21:38,806 --> 01:21:40,406
Well, she has to know eventually.

1337
01:21:40,726 --> 01:21:42,686
- I can't tell her.
- Then I will.

1338
01:21:42,766 --> 01:21:43,766
Nola, stop!

1339
01:21:43,846 --> 01:21:46,086
Well, this is crazy.
We're having a child together!

1340
01:21:46,166 --> 01:21:47,726
We don't have to have a child together.

1341
01:21:47,806 --> 01:21:49,566
It would make life
a hell of a lot simpler if we didn't.

1342
01:21:49,646 --> 01:21:51,686
Yeah, simpler for you, but not for me.

1343
01:21:52,766 --> 01:21:55,046
It occurred to me
that even if you had the child,

1344
01:21:55,126 --> 01:21:57,766
- I could help you out financially.
- That's not enough.

1345
01:21:57,846 --> 01:21:59,766
Nola, be reasonable.

1346
01:21:59,846 --> 01:22:02,846
That's exactly what Tom said
when he broke off our engagement.

1347
01:22:02,926 --> 01:22:05,086
Being reasonable
got me where I am right now.

1348
01:22:05,166 --> 01:22:06,486
So, you're threatening me?

1349
01:22:06,566 --> 01:22:09,166
If I don't do what you say,
you're gonna go to my wife.

1350
01:22:09,486 --> 01:22:11,086
Were you lying to me?

1351
01:22:11,246 --> 01:22:12,646
All those times we made love,

1352
01:22:12,726 --> 01:22:15,726
all those conversations,
were you lying to me then?

1353
01:22:15,806 --> 01:22:18,326
- Of course I wasn't lying.
- Tell Chloe.

1354
01:22:18,406 --> 01:22:22,246
Someone has to explain the situation.
Either you do it, or I'll do it.

1355
01:22:23,326 --> 01:22:26,966
OK, OK. I'll do the right thing.

1356
01:24:22,086 --> 01:24:23,446
Have you seen Chris?

1357
01:24:23,526 --> 01:24:25,526
A minute ago. He went that way.

1358
01:24:25,966 --> 01:24:27,646
Chris?

1359
01:24:28,446 --> 01:24:29,606
Chris?

1360
01:24:30,766 --> 01:24:32,566
Chris?

1361
01:24:40,006 --> 01:24:42,126
Where are you, Chris?

1362
01:24:43,406 --> 01:24:45,406
Chris?

1363
01:24:48,406 --> 01:24:51,206
Chloe, are you there?

1364
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:52,766
Have you seen Chris anywhere?

1365
01:24:52,806 --> 01:24:55,126
No. Could you come up for a minute?

1366
01:24:55,206 --> 01:24:57,806
I want you to give me
some advice about this dress.

1367
01:24:58,446 --> 01:25:00,406
Yeah, OK.

1368
01:25:25,926 --> 01:25:27,926
I'm telling Chloe tomorrow.

1369
01:25:28,006 --> 01:25:30,726
You say that every day,
and you always back out.

1370
01:25:30,806 --> 01:25:33,806
I'm back where I started.
I want something done, Chris.

1371
01:25:33,886 --> 01:25:35,886
If you don't have
the nerve to do it, I'll do it.

1372
01:25:35,966 --> 01:25:38,846
That would be revenge for you against
the whole Hewett family, wouldn't it?

1373
01:25:38,886 --> 01:25:40,926
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1374
01:25:41,006 --> 01:25:43,766
My theory is you want me to tell Chloe
so you don't have to do it yourself.

1375
01:25:43,846 --> 01:25:46,566
My God, it seems like you've
had this whole thing checked out

1376
01:25:46,646 --> 01:25:48,166
- by some psychiatrist.
- I wish.

1377
01:25:48,246 --> 01:25:51,326
I wish had someone to confide in,
but it's all so damn secretive.

1378
01:25:51,406 --> 01:25:53,886
Look, Chris,
if I don't do something about this,

1379
01:25:53,966 --> 01:25:56,006
we're gonna grow apart.
I'm having your child!

1380
01:25:56,086 --> 01:25:58,606
I'm telling her tomorrow, Nola.
What more do you want me to do?

1381
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:00,766
What more? Tell her now!
Tell her tonight!

1382
01:26:00,846 --> 01:26:04,126
I can't, not before she goes to sleep.
It wouldn't be the right time.

1383
01:26:04,526 --> 01:26:06,166
Nola, tomorrow is fine.

1384
01:26:06,246 --> 01:26:10,446
- What time will you get back from work?
- Same time I always get off, 6:30.

1385
01:26:10,526 --> 01:26:12,046
So you'll be home by a quarter to seven?

1386
01:26:12,086 --> 01:26:15,646
Yeah. Chris, you make me say
these things. I hate myself for them.

1387
01:26:15,766 --> 01:26:17,926
- I just want us to be together.
- We will be.

1388
01:26:19,886 --> 01:26:22,406
You were very nervy
all through the ballet.

1389
01:26:22,486 --> 01:26:23,686
Did you hate it?

1390
01:26:23,766 --> 01:26:26,406
- No, I'm just out of sorts.
- Yeah.

1391
01:26:26,486 --> 01:26:28,366
I thought you were gonna pass out.

1392
01:26:28,406 --> 01:26:30,726
Low blood sugar. I'll be better soon.

1393
01:26:33,686 --> 01:26:36,006
I still can't do it with you tonight.

1394
01:26:36,046 --> 01:26:38,486
I'm not over my little dose of whatever.

1395
01:26:42,526 --> 01:26:45,726
Did the cleaner put one of my
tennis shirts in with your gear?

1396
01:26:45,806 --> 01:26:46,926
No. What are you doing?

1397
01:26:47,006 --> 01:26:48,686
Really? Just let me have a quick look.

1398
01:26:48,726 --> 01:26:50,686
- I can't find it anywhere.
- No. Look, I'll check, I'll check.

1399
01:26:50,726 --> 01:26:54,606
- I've got everything arranged in there.
- OK. I wasn't gonna disturb anything.

1400
01:26:54,686 --> 01:26:56,406
'Cause I don't know
where else it can be.

1401
01:26:56,486 --> 01:26:59,326
She's always bloody
mixing my stuff in with yours.

1402
01:27:03,446 --> 01:27:04,446
Is this it?

1403
01:27:04,526 --> 01:27:07,086
See, I knew it!
She always bloody does that.

1404
01:27:07,166 --> 01:27:09,086
I've got to have words
with her about it.

1405
01:27:09,166 --> 01:27:10,766
It's really...

1406
01:27:10,846 --> 01:27:12,566
What did you just put in your pocket?

1407
01:27:12,646 --> 01:27:15,246
- Oh, it's just my pill box.
- What do you mean a pill box?

1408
01:27:15,326 --> 01:27:16,686
A pill box. You know
what a pill box looks like.

1409
01:27:16,766 --> 01:27:18,446
Let me have a look at it.
What pills are you taking?

1410
01:27:18,526 --> 01:27:20,086
No, they're just my pills. I need them.

1411
01:27:20,166 --> 01:27:22,766
No, no, no, it's for stress,
'cause you stress me so much.

1412
01:27:22,846 --> 01:27:24,046
- Guess what?
- What?

1413
01:27:24,126 --> 01:27:26,526
I got tickets for the theater
for tomorrow night.

1414
01:27:26,566 --> 01:27:28,566
You haven't. That's not like you.

1415
01:27:28,646 --> 01:27:30,886
- What for?
- The Woman in White.

1416
01:27:30,966 --> 01:27:33,766
- I heard it's great.
- I thought you hated musicals.

1417
01:27:33,846 --> 01:27:35,566
No, that's not so.

1418
01:27:35,606 --> 01:27:39,086
- And anyway, you love his music.
- Well, that's great.

1419
01:27:39,166 --> 01:27:41,086
I'll have to meet you
outside the theater,

1420
01:27:41,166 --> 01:27:43,526
'cause I'll be coming
straight from the gallery.

1421
01:27:43,606 --> 01:27:45,326
Why don't you take the chauffeur?

1422
01:27:45,406 --> 01:27:49,006
I'll grab a taxi, and with any luck
I can get an hour of tennis in.

1423
01:27:49,926 --> 01:27:52,046
You're so sweet.

1424
01:27:52,126 --> 01:27:54,606
You knew how much
I wanted to see that.

1425
01:27:57,646 --> 01:28:00,446
All right, come to bed,
because you're tired, my darling.

1426
01:28:00,526 --> 01:28:02,326
OK, I will.

1427
01:28:05,286 --> 01:28:07,966
- Hello?
- Hello, Nola?

1428
01:28:09,286 --> 01:28:11,486
When you get off work today,
come right home.

1429
01:28:11,566 --> 01:28:13,566
I have some good news.

1430
01:28:14,806 --> 01:28:18,006
Everything's taken care of,
but I'm reluctant to talk on the phone.

1431
01:28:18,086 --> 01:28:19,966
You've got to meet me
right after work.

1432
01:28:20,046 --> 01:28:22,726
We have... plans to make.

1433
01:28:23,686 --> 01:28:27,006
OK. I'll cancel my agent appointment.

1434
01:28:27,086 --> 01:28:28,806
It's good. This is good.

1435
01:28:28,886 --> 01:28:31,686
I'll see you soon. Bye.

1436
01:28:31,726 --> 01:28:34,126
- Was it him?
- Yeah.

1437
01:28:36,686 --> 01:28:39,726
So, you'll have to be prepared
to cash flow the first six months.

1438
01:28:39,806 --> 01:28:41,966
Is that right, Chris? A half year?

1439
01:28:42,046 --> 01:28:43,046
Yes.

1440
01:28:43,126 --> 01:28:45,766
A half year should do it, maybe less.

1441
01:28:45,806 --> 01:28:48,486
Good. Jolly good.
Well, see you next time.

1442
01:28:54,886 --> 01:28:56,606
Good.

1443
01:28:57,886 --> 01:29:00,846
Sayonara indeed. I thought you
showed some interesting ideas there

1444
01:29:00,926 --> 01:29:03,006
for developing their capacity.

1445
01:29:03,086 --> 01:29:05,606
- I'm excited about this venture, Rod.
- Good, good.

1446
01:29:15,486 --> 01:29:18,446
- Playing a little tennis later?
- Yes.

1447
01:29:19,406 --> 01:29:22,966
Amazing energy. Love it. Envy it.

1448
01:30:29,566 --> 01:30:32,686
- Yes?
- Hello. I'm Chris.

1449
01:30:32,766 --> 01:30:35,406
I'm a friend of Nola's,
your neighbor from next door.

1450
01:30:35,486 --> 01:30:36,686
We met here last...

1451
01:30:36,766 --> 01:30:39,166
I'm sorry, I don't let anybody in.

1452
01:30:39,246 --> 01:30:41,246
But... but, do you not remember?
We met...

1453
01:30:42,686 --> 01:30:45,886
She asked you something
about your trouble with your mice,

1454
01:30:45,926 --> 01:30:48,526
and you mentioned
something about peanut butter.

1455
01:30:48,606 --> 01:30:51,606
- Oh, yes. Yes.
- Yes.

1456
01:30:53,526 --> 01:30:55,566
I'm Chris Wilton, the tennis instructor.

1457
01:30:55,646 --> 01:30:57,046
Well, what's the trouble?

1458
01:30:57,126 --> 01:30:59,966
No trouble at all really, and I...
I don't mean to disturb you.

1459
01:31:00,006 --> 01:31:03,966
I was wondering if I could...
could look at your TV reception.

1460
01:31:04,046 --> 01:31:07,526
- We seem to have trouble next door.
- Oh, with the TV?

1461
01:31:07,606 --> 01:31:08,606
Yes.

1462
01:31:08,686 --> 01:31:12,646
We're getting some interference,
and it's Nola's favorite TV night.

1463
01:31:12,726 --> 01:31:15,926
So I don't know if it's the
aerial on the roof or if it's us.

1464
01:31:16,006 --> 01:31:18,006
- It's in there.
- Thank... thank you.

1465
01:31:18,086 --> 01:31:20,086
I have to take my medicine.

1466
01:31:36,366 --> 01:31:40,046
There was no trouble before.
I had it on and it was fine.

1467
01:32:03,086 --> 01:32:06,086
Didn't you say your name was Harris?

1468
01:35:48,566 --> 01:35:50,526
Mrs. Eastby?

1469
01:35:53,686 --> 01:35:55,686
It's lan.

1470
01:36:02,846 --> 01:36:04,686
Mrs. Eastby?

1471
01:36:09,486 --> 01:36:11,686
Mrs. Eastby? It's lan.

1472
01:36:13,966 --> 01:36:17,446
I'm going down the corner shop.
Can I get you anything?

1473
01:36:21,766 --> 01:36:24,446
Mrs. Eastby, are you all right?

1474
01:36:48,326 --> 01:36:49,286
- Hi, princess.
- Hi.

1475
01:36:49,366 --> 01:36:52,046
D'you ever get that
portable CD player we talked about?

1476
01:36:52,126 --> 01:36:54,166
Yes, I did.
Thank you so much for helping me.

1477
01:36:54,246 --> 01:36:55,246
Excellent.

1478
01:37:12,206 --> 01:37:14,646
- See you later. Bye-bye.
- OK. Bye.

1479
01:37:45,246 --> 01:37:46,606
Nola.

1480
01:37:56,926 --> 01:37:58,406
Excuse me.

1481
01:38:07,846 --> 01:38:09,366
Hello.

1482
01:38:10,086 --> 01:38:11,406
Where are you?

1483
01:38:12,606 --> 01:38:15,166
I'm almost there. I'll be two minutes.

1484
01:38:46,886 --> 01:38:48,326
- Good evening.
- Hello.

1485
01:38:53,366 --> 01:38:55,406
- How much?
- That's two pounds, please.

1486
01:38:55,486 --> 01:38:57,006
Two pounds.

1487
01:39:02,126 --> 01:39:04,126
- Two pounds. My tickets?
- Yes. Thank you.

1488
01:39:21,566 --> 01:39:23,166
It's a terrible mess in there, sir.

1489
01:39:23,246 --> 01:39:25,286
Well, I think it's pretty obvious
what's happened here.

1490
01:39:25,366 --> 01:39:27,366
Someone's robbed
and killed the old lady.

1491
01:39:27,446 --> 01:39:28,766
As he, or they, were running out

1492
01:39:28,846 --> 01:39:31,326
they've run into the Rice woman
coming in, so they've shot her too.

1493
01:39:31,406 --> 01:39:32,686
Either out of panic,

1494
01:39:32,766 --> 01:39:35,766
or because they saw a chance
to make an additional score.

1495
01:39:35,846 --> 01:39:38,446
Poor unsuspecting soul
came home at the wrong moment.

1496
01:39:38,526 --> 01:39:40,646
He's cleared out the house
of all prescription drugs, sir.

1497
01:39:40,726 --> 01:39:43,086
Oh, no, it's definitely
a drugs-related robbery.

1498
01:39:43,166 --> 01:39:45,526
He might have known there
was an old lady living in flat 8.

1499
01:39:45,566 --> 01:39:46,926
Probably cased her.

1500
01:39:46,966 --> 01:39:49,366
Was surprised by running
into the other woman.

1501
01:39:49,406 --> 01:39:51,446
She picked the wrong time to come home.

1502
01:39:51,966 --> 01:39:54,166
Some people just don't have any luck.

1503
01:39:55,646 --> 01:39:58,166
Yeah, I just spoke to her.
This is unbelievable.

1504
01:39:58,246 --> 01:40:00,126
Half an hour ago I came down the stairs,

1505
01:40:00,206 --> 01:40:01,806
knocked on Mrs. Eastby's door
'cause I couldn't...

1506
01:40:01,886 --> 01:40:03,086
Do you need anything from the car?

1507
01:40:03,166 --> 01:40:05,206
Yeah. You can tell the
exhibits officer to get a move on,

1508
01:40:05,286 --> 01:40:08,526
- 'cause this is getting ridiculous.
- Yeah, this is quite important.

1509
01:40:08,606 --> 01:40:10,526
She usually bakes today, and
I thought maybe she'd run out of stuff.

1510
01:40:10,566 --> 01:40:12,286
So I asked her if she
needed anything, and then

1511
01:40:12,366 --> 01:40:13,726
- So, half an hour ago? Spoke to her?
- She didn't answer.

1512
01:40:13,766 --> 01:40:16,526
- Yeah, half an hour ago. Yeah.
- So whoever it was, was still in there.

1513
01:40:16,606 --> 01:40:18,326
That's terrifying. I can't believe that.

1514
01:40:18,406 --> 01:40:21,046
- So someone was in there?
- And you spoke to Nola Rice,

1515
01:40:21,126 --> 01:40:23,086
- and did she say anything?
- Sorry to interrupt.

1516
01:40:23,166 --> 01:40:24,886
Could we send the
photographers in now, please?

1517
01:40:24,966 --> 01:40:26,086
No, hang on. If you just wait.

1518
01:40:26,166 --> 01:40:28,526
We've just got to get the
exhibit officer in there first.

1519
01:40:28,606 --> 01:40:31,846
Chris, Chris, can you
liaise with this man here?

1520
01:40:31,926 --> 01:40:34,406
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just catch him there.

1521
01:40:34,486 --> 01:40:36,886
Well, I ran...
Yeah, I bumped into Nola right here...

1522
01:40:36,966 --> 01:40:38,846
Scenes of Crime will be
on their way very shortly, all right?

1523
01:40:38,886 --> 01:40:40,206
- Yeah...
- Yeah, I spoke...

1524
01:40:40,286 --> 01:40:42,446
I bumped into her here.
We talked and we chatted.

1525
01:40:42,526 --> 01:40:44,406
I recommended a piece
of music equipment.

1526
01:40:44,486 --> 01:40:46,926
- She'd bought it. Yeah, and...
- Music equipment? What was that?

1527
01:40:46,966 --> 01:40:50,326
Nothing. It was a portable CD player
which reads MP3s, CD rewrites...

1528
01:40:50,366 --> 01:40:52,406
It's drugs, guv.
Someone after money for some drugs.

1529
01:40:52,486 --> 01:40:54,566
Well, Mrs. Eastby wasn't wealthy.

1530
01:40:54,646 --> 01:40:55,926
- They don't care.
- Drugs?

1531
01:40:56,006 --> 01:40:58,846
Yeah, definitely drugs.
Someone after money for 'em, and...

1532
01:40:58,926 --> 01:41:01,006
They'll kill you for a pound
if they wanted to, you know.

1533
01:41:01,086 --> 01:41:02,486
Well, it's a sorry state of affairs,
isn't it?

1534
01:41:02,566 --> 01:41:05,926
Well, it's not as if the old lady
had any enemies. She rarely went out.

1535
01:41:06,006 --> 01:41:07,286
- Used a shotgun.
- A shotgun?

1536
01:41:07,366 --> 01:41:09,046
That's a... That's a bit obvious,
isn't it?

1537
01:41:09,126 --> 01:41:11,246
- Somebody must've seen something.
- Oh, not if it was sawn-off.

1538
01:41:11,286 --> 01:41:14,286
They can make them pretty small.
Catherine, love, you can't park there.

1539
01:41:14,366 --> 01:41:16,566
Leave that clear.
We've got the SOCO coming down.

1540
01:41:18,366 --> 01:41:20,606
Did you like the musical last night?

1541
01:41:21,326 --> 01:41:25,246
Yeah, I did. It was good fun.
Pretty music.

1542
01:41:25,326 --> 01:41:27,726
Yeah, he's very good.

1543
01:41:28,366 --> 01:41:30,486
I'm gonna get tickets
for Mummy and Papa.

1544
01:41:30,566 --> 01:41:32,606
Good.

1545
01:41:35,406 --> 01:41:38,846
- Oh, my God.
- What? What is it?

1546
01:41:40,166 --> 01:41:43,166
Oh, my God! Nola!

1547
01:41:43,246 --> 01:41:46,006
- Nola Rice.
- What?

1548
01:41:46,326 --> 01:41:50,006
She was killed in a burglary.
A... a drugs burglary.

1549
01:41:50,646 --> 01:41:53,646
What? Here, let me see that.

1550
01:41:53,726 --> 01:41:55,526
Jesus Christ!

1551
01:41:59,486 --> 01:42:01,526
Apparently, she was
coming home from work,

1552
01:42:01,606 --> 01:42:05,566
and someone who was already there
who'd burgled another flat and rob...

1553
01:42:05,646 --> 01:42:08,166
And shot an old lady,
ran into Nola by chance, and...

1554
01:42:08,246 --> 01:42:12,206
She was entering the building,
and he was running out and he shot her.

1555
01:42:12,286 --> 01:42:14,566
Oh, my God.

1556
01:42:20,126 --> 01:42:21,646
Hello?

1557
01:42:22,566 --> 01:42:25,286
Yeah. Yeah,
we've just this second read it.

1558
01:42:25,326 --> 01:42:26,926
Isn't it just terrible?

1559
01:42:27,006 --> 01:42:30,286
I never got along with her,
but this is just tragic.

1560
01:42:30,366 --> 01:42:33,366
- It's tragic.
- Does Tom know?

1561
01:42:33,486 --> 01:42:35,646
I've just called him.
He can't believe it.

1562
01:42:36,286 --> 01:42:37,966
I know.

1563
01:42:38,006 --> 01:42:40,566
Wait, wait, that must be him.
I'll call you back.

1564
01:42:40,646 --> 01:42:42,406
Hello?

1565
01:42:42,446 --> 01:42:44,966
Yeah, we've just read it,
and Mummy just called.

1566
01:42:45,046 --> 01:42:47,886
Well, yeah, yeah, I know.
I mean, wrong place at the wrong time.

1567
01:42:47,966 --> 01:42:49,326
I suppose she must've...

1568
01:42:49,406 --> 01:42:52,046
I mean, disturbed a burglar
or burglars, or whatever.

1569
01:42:52,126 --> 01:42:54,406
I mean, it doesn't... It doesn't say
how many of them there were.

1570
01:42:54,486 --> 01:42:56,206
Well, even Mummy's really shaken up,

1571
01:42:56,286 --> 01:42:58,486
and you know they
weren't exactly friends.

1572
01:42:58,526 --> 01:43:01,806
It says here that there's been a rise
in drug-related crime in the area

1573
01:43:01,886 --> 01:43:03,766
over the past year.

1574
01:43:03,846 --> 01:43:06,486
Did you hear that? Yeah.

1575
01:43:06,566 --> 01:43:10,926
I just can't believe it.
It's just... I know.

1576
01:43:17,246 --> 01:43:18,646
Mummy.

1577
01:43:20,806 --> 01:43:22,806
I've got something to tell you.

1578
01:43:22,886 --> 01:43:24,886
But I want Chris to be here.

1579
01:43:26,206 --> 01:43:28,086
Chris?

1580
01:43:28,126 --> 01:43:31,126
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

1581
01:43:31,206 --> 01:43:33,206
He was just in here. Chris?

1582
01:43:33,886 --> 01:43:35,886
Chris?

1583
01:43:43,206 --> 01:43:44,566
He was just here.

1584
01:43:44,606 --> 01:43:46,286
Well, what did you want to tell me?

1585
01:43:46,366 --> 01:43:48,806
Just wait. Wait, wait. Chris?

1586
01:44:21,166 --> 01:44:23,326
Where are you? Chris?

1587
01:44:24,846 --> 01:44:26,086
Well, what did you want to tell me?

1588
01:44:26,166 --> 01:44:27,846
Well, I just really want him to be here.

1589
01:44:27,926 --> 01:44:30,246
Hang on, there he is. There you are!

1590
01:44:30,806 --> 01:44:32,926
- Can we tell her now?
- Sure.

1591
01:44:33,006 --> 01:44:35,246
Well, I wanted you to be here.

1592
01:44:35,326 --> 01:44:36,846
Well, what is it?

1593
01:44:36,926 --> 01:44:38,406
Mummy...

1594
01:44:38,486 --> 01:44:41,246
You can finally
crack open the champagne.

1595
01:44:41,326 --> 01:44:43,046
It looks like I'm pregnant.

1596
01:44:43,126 --> 01:44:45,366
- When did you hear?
- This morning.

1597
01:44:45,446 --> 01:44:49,246
- Oh, I'm so delighted.
- Oh, good.

1598
01:44:49,886 --> 01:44:51,366
Alec?

1599
01:44:51,446 --> 01:44:54,166
Alec? Come here.

1600
01:44:54,366 --> 01:44:56,806
We're both walking on air.

1601
01:44:56,846 --> 01:45:00,006
Well, you're walking on air. Your
husband looks a bit shell shocked.

1602
01:45:00,086 --> 01:45:01,966
- 'Cause I've exhausted him, poor thing.
- What?

1603
01:45:02,046 --> 01:45:03,286
Chloe's pregnant.

1604
01:45:03,366 --> 01:45:05,846
Oh, what a great day.
Oh, my darling, congratulations.

1605
01:45:05,886 --> 01:45:08,286
I'm absolutely thrilled.
I couldn't be more pleased.

1606
01:45:08,366 --> 01:45:10,006
Thank you so much.
It's such a relief.

1607
01:45:10,086 --> 01:45:11,046
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

1608
01:45:11,126 --> 01:45:12,686
- Yes?
- Phone call, sir. Your secretary.

1609
01:45:12,726 --> 01:45:15,126
It's wonderful, isn't it? Look at her,
doesn't she look gorgeous?

1610
01:45:15,166 --> 01:45:18,966
- Margaret, I'm pregnant!
- Congratulations! That's wonderful.

1611
01:45:19,046 --> 01:45:20,486
Thank you, Margaret.

1612
01:45:21,406 --> 01:45:22,886
Sam?

1613
01:45:22,966 --> 01:45:25,526
Yeah, there's a message for you
that a Mike Banner,

1614
01:45:25,606 --> 01:45:27,486
Detective Mike Banner, called.

1615
01:45:27,566 --> 01:45:30,686
He wants you to call him
at Shepherd's Bush police station.

1616
01:45:31,166 --> 01:45:34,206
Yeah. No, I don't think it's urgent,
but he left a number.

1617
01:45:34,326 --> 01:45:36,246
- Banner?
- Sweetheart...

1618
01:45:36,286 --> 01:45:37,686
I bet it was that night...

1619
01:45:37,766 --> 01:45:41,046
- You better give me the number.
- Look, that's flattering.

1620
01:45:43,526 --> 01:45:47,006
Well, the last time you went,
he said everything was fine, didn't he?

1621
01:45:47,086 --> 01:45:49,246
Yes, and he just made me
completely calm down.

1622
01:45:49,326 --> 01:45:51,526
Oh, I just can't believe it.
It's marvelous.

1623
01:45:51,566 --> 01:45:53,166
OK. Thanks, Samantha. Bye.

1624
01:45:53,246 --> 01:45:55,806
He just seemed odd,
there was something weird.

1625
01:45:57,926 --> 01:46:01,126
- Granny would have been thrilled.
...alternative medicine.

1626
01:46:01,206 --> 01:46:04,366
Granny would have loved it.
I wish she could be here.

1627
01:46:04,446 --> 01:46:07,246
- Thank God. Thank God.
- Congratulations!

1628
01:46:07,326 --> 01:46:09,086
Detective Banner, please.

1629
01:46:09,166 --> 01:46:11,166
This is Chris Wilton.

1630
01:46:14,846 --> 01:46:15,846
Oh, hello.

1631
01:46:15,926 --> 01:46:18,406
This is Chris Wilton. You called?

1632
01:46:18,526 --> 01:46:21,366
Oh, yes. I was wondering if there
was a time you could drop in here?

1633
01:46:21,446 --> 01:46:23,686
Or if it's more convenient,
we can come and see you.

1634
01:46:23,766 --> 01:46:27,166
- In reference to what?
- I'd rather not explain on the phone.

1635
01:46:27,246 --> 01:46:30,526
It's just a few questions, and I'm sure
you'd prefer it to be discreet.

1636
01:46:33,406 --> 01:46:35,606
I've no reason to bring a lawyer, do I?

1637
01:46:35,686 --> 01:46:37,686
I certainly hope not.

1638
01:47:44,246 --> 01:47:46,806
- Chris Wilton. Detective Banner.
- Good afternoon.

1639
01:47:46,886 --> 01:47:49,886
- How do you do? Take a seat.
- Thank you.

1640
01:47:50,806 --> 01:47:52,806
This is nothing to be alarmed about.

1641
01:47:52,886 --> 01:47:56,926
We're just doing a routine investigation
into the Betty Eastby-Nola Rice murders.

1642
01:47:58,526 --> 01:48:01,246
Were you acquainted
with either of the victims?

1643
01:48:01,326 --> 01:48:03,686
Peripherally, I knew Nola Rice.

1644
01:48:04,286 --> 01:48:05,526
How?

1645
01:48:06,446 --> 01:48:09,726
She was engaged for a time
to the man who's now my brother-in-law.

1646
01:48:09,806 --> 01:48:11,526
That's...

1647
01:48:12,206 --> 01:48:14,326
...Tom Hewett?
- That's correct.

1648
01:48:16,166 --> 01:48:19,406
They broke up. A year ago. More.

1649
01:48:20,846 --> 01:48:22,846
When did you last see her?

1650
01:48:23,766 --> 01:48:26,086
Oh, God, I can't remember.

1651
01:48:29,526 --> 01:48:32,766
At the Tate Modern.
My wife and I ran into her.

1652
01:48:32,846 --> 01:48:35,286
But that was a long time ago.

1653
01:48:37,126 --> 01:48:38,766
Have you seen her since?

1654
01:48:39,166 --> 01:48:40,966
Not that I recall.

1655
01:48:43,726 --> 01:48:45,366
Have?

1656
01:48:46,566 --> 01:48:48,006
Have you ever seen this?

1657
01:48:49,006 --> 01:48:50,966
No. What is it?

1658
01:48:52,286 --> 01:48:54,886
Are you aware
that Nola Rice kept a diary?

1659
01:49:04,406 --> 01:49:06,086
No.

1660
01:49:07,086 --> 01:49:09,086
As you can see...

1661
01:49:09,686 --> 01:49:12,086
...you're all over it.

1662
01:49:19,326 --> 01:49:21,686
Yes, I can see that.

1663
01:49:24,926 --> 01:49:27,126
Do you still claim
that you haven't seen her,

1664
01:49:27,206 --> 01:49:29,726
except for more than a year ago
at the Tate Modern?

1665
01:49:32,766 --> 01:49:36,326
You can't blame me for trying to hide
the fact that I had an affair with her.

1666
01:49:36,966 --> 01:49:39,326
But you people have to protect me here.

1667
01:49:40,246 --> 01:49:43,046
I hope you don't think
I had anything to do with her murder.

1668
01:49:43,126 --> 01:49:45,086
How long did your affair go on?

1669
01:49:50,326 --> 01:49:53,206
It began casually
when she was still engaged to Tom.

1670
01:49:54,006 --> 01:49:56,166
They broke up, she moved away.

1671
01:49:57,246 --> 01:50:01,006
She came back and I ran into her
at the Tate Modern, and it began again.

1672
01:50:03,446 --> 01:50:05,406
God, have a heart.

1673
01:50:06,206 --> 01:50:08,606
My wife is gonna have a baby.

1674
01:50:08,886 --> 01:50:11,126
This will devastate her.

1675
01:50:12,326 --> 01:50:13,726
Did you...

1676
01:50:14,086 --> 01:50:17,966
...promise that you were going
to leave your wife and marry Miss Rice?

1677
01:50:18,366 --> 01:50:20,446
No, I did not.

1678
01:50:20,806 --> 01:50:23,166
I mean, it's possible
she had that fantasy.

1679
01:50:24,126 --> 01:50:27,406
And, obviously, she wrote that I did.

1680
01:50:32,846 --> 01:50:35,566
But I tried to finesse
that point with her.

1681
01:50:35,646 --> 01:50:37,886
I didn't want the
sexual relationship to end,

1682
01:50:37,966 --> 01:50:40,046
but I'm not gonna break up my home.

1683
01:50:41,766 --> 01:50:44,726
My wife and I are
trying very hard to have a baby.

1684
01:50:44,766 --> 01:50:48,446
We've seen several
fertility doctors, et cetera.

1685
01:50:49,526 --> 01:50:53,126
You can check that out if you like,
but I beg you to be discreet.

1686
01:50:53,206 --> 01:50:55,246
But you did lead her on,

1687
01:50:55,326 --> 01:50:58,126
so that she had the impression
you were unhappy at home.

1688
01:50:58,806 --> 01:51:01,086
I tried to tip-toe around it
and not lead her on,

1689
01:51:01,166 --> 01:51:03,926
but she's going to believe
what she wants to believe.

1690
01:51:04,806 --> 01:51:10,246
Look, don't irresponsibly run roughshod
over this and wreck people's lives.

1691
01:51:10,886 --> 01:51:13,726
I mean, there is no case
because I would not harm anyone,

1692
01:51:13,806 --> 01:51:15,886
much less Nola Rice.

1693
01:51:21,246 --> 01:51:24,166
Isn't it obvious
that somebody killed her neighbor,

1694
01:51:24,206 --> 01:51:26,246
and she walked in when it was happening?

1695
01:51:28,126 --> 01:51:31,646
God, I beg you, don't go on
a fishing expedition over this and...

1696
01:51:32,046 --> 01:51:34,046
...wreck people's lives.

1697
01:51:34,126 --> 01:51:37,206
My family, my marriage is at stake.

1698
01:51:38,286 --> 01:51:40,926
We just have to
check out everything in a murder case.

1699
01:51:41,006 --> 01:51:43,406
OK, but I'm not your man.

1700
01:51:43,886 --> 01:51:47,126
I know it's not the most
honorable thing to cheat on your wife,

1701
01:51:47,206 --> 01:51:49,446
but that does not make me a murderer.

1702
01:51:49,606 --> 01:51:52,526
We're... obligated
to review the situation.

1703
01:51:52,606 --> 01:51:54,606
I understand
it's sensitive stuff for you.

1704
01:51:54,686 --> 01:51:56,286
And if we have to talk to you again,

1705
01:51:56,366 --> 01:51:58,686
we'll do everything in our power
to keep it very private.

1706
01:51:58,766 --> 01:52:00,286
Your personal life's your own.

1707
01:52:00,366 --> 01:52:04,206
We're not making any moral judgments,
just investigating a crime.

1708
01:52:14,406 --> 01:52:16,486
I understand.

1709
01:52:17,406 --> 01:52:19,046
Look...

1710
01:52:19,126 --> 01:52:21,326
...if you have to get
in contact with me again,

1711
01:52:21,406 --> 01:52:23,406
which, God in heaven,
I hope you don't,

1712
01:52:23,486 --> 01:52:25,446
please call me on my mobile.

1713
01:52:25,886 --> 01:52:27,926
This is my number.

1714
01:52:29,806 --> 01:52:31,406
Thanks.

1715
01:52:32,126 --> 01:52:33,086
One other thing.

1716
01:52:33,166 --> 01:52:35,566
Do you own or have access to a shotgun?

1717
01:52:37,766 --> 01:52:39,206
Me?

1718
01:52:39,406 --> 01:52:40,606
No.

1719
01:52:40,686 --> 01:52:44,566
My father-in-law shoots
on the estate, but not me.

1720
01:52:44,646 --> 01:52:46,806
You can check it out, but...

1721
01:52:47,806 --> 01:52:51,766
...I beg you to consider mine
and his position.

1722
01:52:51,846 --> 01:52:53,926
Of course.

1723
01:52:56,926 --> 01:52:58,886
Thank you.

1724
01:53:07,526 --> 01:53:09,526
So, what do you think?

1725
01:53:10,046 --> 01:53:11,846
I think it's what it looks like.

1726
01:53:11,926 --> 01:53:13,966
Someone robbed and killed Mrs. Eastby,

1727
01:53:14,046 --> 01:53:17,606
who was surprised leaving,
and killed Nola Rice.

1728
01:53:18,646 --> 01:53:22,206
Yeah, I know. I know, it's got
drug robbery written all over it.

1729
01:53:22,286 --> 01:53:24,286
He's 'specting a baby.

1730
01:53:24,486 --> 01:53:26,886
OK, he's not gonna win
a medal for fidelity, but...

1731
01:53:28,046 --> 01:53:29,646
...we can find out discreetly enough

1732
01:53:29,726 --> 01:53:32,726
whether the Hewetts
had a shotgun unaccounted for.

1733
01:53:34,606 --> 01:53:38,686
I don't think that he would know the
first thing about stealing one though,

1734
01:53:38,766 --> 01:53:41,566
never mind sawing one off.

1735
01:53:42,406 --> 01:53:45,366
It's a bit of a stretch.
He's got no previous convictions.

1736
01:53:45,446 --> 01:53:47,166
Not even a speeding ticket.

1737
01:53:47,246 --> 01:53:50,046
The coroner says
that Eastby was killed first.

1738
01:53:50,126 --> 01:53:52,446
- Yeah.
- There's no sign of a forced entry.

1739
01:53:52,526 --> 01:53:54,766
So Mrs. Eastby knew the killer,
if she let him in.

1740
01:53:54,846 --> 01:53:56,326
Well, come on, Mike.

1741
01:53:56,406 --> 01:53:58,246
Ninety percent
of the crimes we go out on,

1742
01:53:58,286 --> 01:54:00,446
people open their doors
and invite the criminals in.

1743
01:54:00,526 --> 01:54:02,846
Yeah, I know, you're right.
I'm just thinking out loud.

1744
01:54:02,926 --> 01:54:05,886
- It's just he's got a real motive.
- Yeah, maybe.

1745
01:54:05,966 --> 01:54:10,566
But a motive, as you and I
both painfully know, is not a case.

1746
01:54:10,646 --> 01:54:13,686
I'm torn because the Rice murder
was clearly an afterthought,

1747
01:54:13,766 --> 01:54:15,606
but I'd love to pursue it a little more.

1748
01:54:15,686 --> 01:54:19,046
But I'm reluctant to fish around
and cause problems for everybody.

1749
01:54:19,126 --> 01:54:21,406
Well, if something develops,
we can pursue it.

1750
01:54:21,486 --> 01:54:24,206
I doubt anything's
gonna drop into our laps.

1751
01:56:21,966 --> 01:56:23,646
Chris.

1752
01:56:33,606 --> 01:56:35,366
Nola...

1753
01:56:37,446 --> 01:56:39,686
...it wasn't easy.

1754
01:56:40,646 --> 01:56:43,446
But when the time came,
I could pull the trigger.

1755
01:56:45,326 --> 01:56:48,326
You never know who your neighbors are
till there's a crisis.

1756
01:56:49,926 --> 01:56:54,126
You can learn to push the guilt
under the rug and... go on.

1757
01:56:55,326 --> 01:56:57,086
You have to.

1758
01:56:57,166 --> 01:56:59,686
Otherwise it overwhelms you.

1759
01:56:59,766 --> 01:57:01,926
And what about me?

1760
01:57:01,966 --> 01:57:04,726
What about the next-door neighbor?

1761
01:57:05,486 --> 01:57:08,486
I had no involvement
in this awful affair.

1762
01:57:09,926 --> 01:57:14,846
Is there no problem about me
having to die as an innocent bystander?

1763
01:57:16,766 --> 01:57:21,166
The innocent are sometimes slain
to make way for a grander scheme.

1764
01:57:23,246 --> 01:57:25,486
You were collateral damage.

1765
01:57:25,566 --> 01:57:28,046
So was your own child.

1766
01:57:32,286 --> 01:57:34,286
Sophocles said:

1767
01:57:35,766 --> 01:57:37,966
"To never have been born

1768
01:57:38,566 --> 01:57:41,046
may be the greatest boon of all."

1769
01:57:43,406 --> 01:57:45,726
Prepare to pay the price, Chris.

1770
01:57:46,646 --> 01:57:48,806
Your actions were clumsy.

1771
01:57:48,886 --> 01:57:50,566
Full of holes.

1772
01:57:50,646 --> 01:57:53,846
Almost like someone
begging to be found out.

1773
01:57:57,326 --> 01:58:00,326
It would be fitting
if I were apprehended

1774
01:58:00,366 --> 01:58:02,286
and punished.

1775
01:58:03,406 --> 01:58:07,126
At least there would be
some small sign of justice.

1776
01:58:07,206 --> 01:58:10,206
Some small...

1777
01:58:10,886 --> 01:58:14,326
...measure of hope
for the possibility of meaning.

1778
01:58:16,726 --> 01:58:19,886
Chris Wilton killed them.
I see how he did it.

1779
01:58:19,966 --> 01:58:21,726
What?

1780
01:58:22,926 --> 01:58:24,486
It's as we speculated

1781
01:58:24,566 --> 01:58:26,966
and said was too elaborate,
but that's what he did.

1782
01:58:27,046 --> 01:58:30,126
He killed the next-door neighbor first
to throw us off the scent

1783
01:58:30,206 --> 01:58:31,886
and set up the appearance of a robbery.

1784
01:58:31,966 --> 01:58:32,966
He waited in the hall.

1785
01:58:33,046 --> 01:58:34,926
He knew she'd be back
the same time as usual,

1786
01:58:35,006 --> 01:58:38,286
and he killed her, making it seem like
she surprised a burglar running out.

1787
01:58:38,366 --> 01:58:40,486
He planned it all so he could
make the theater in time

1788
01:58:40,566 --> 01:58:42,806
to strengthen his alibi,
if one became necessary.

1789
01:58:42,886 --> 01:58:45,406
Now, I haven't figured out
the weapon problem,

1790
01:58:45,486 --> 01:58:46,966
and I know it's a lot to ask a jury,

1791
01:58:47,006 --> 01:58:49,206
but the correctness of it
came to me in my sleep

1792
01:58:49,286 --> 01:58:51,046
and I am going to break this case.

1793
01:58:51,126 --> 01:58:52,966
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news, Mike.

1794
01:58:53,046 --> 01:58:54,006
What?

1795
01:58:54,086 --> 01:58:56,046
Not that your dream
isn't of primary interest to a jury.

1796
01:58:56,086 --> 01:58:57,366
What's the bad news?

1797
01:58:57,446 --> 01:59:00,326
There was another shooting
in the area last night, 4am.

1798
01:59:00,406 --> 01:59:03,126
A drug addict killed.
Looks like a drug sale turned nasty.

1799
01:59:03,206 --> 01:59:06,446
What, and he confessed
to killing two women before he died?

1800
01:59:06,526 --> 01:59:08,206
No, he didn't have to.

1801
01:59:08,286 --> 01:59:11,486
The old woman's wedding ring
was right in his pocket.

1802
01:59:12,166 --> 01:59:15,406
- No.
- Name and date engraved right on it.

1803
01:59:16,406 --> 01:59:19,606
- I don't believe it.
- I know. I know.

1804
01:59:19,686 --> 01:59:22,006
Your case looked good, lots of motive.

1805
01:59:22,046 --> 01:59:24,326
But his motive
was pretty strong too. Heroin.

1806
01:59:24,646 --> 01:59:27,046
Junkie with a long string
of convictions.

1807
01:59:27,646 --> 01:59:29,646
Killed by one of his own, no doubt.

1808
01:59:29,726 --> 01:59:31,566
Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.

1809
01:59:31,646 --> 01:59:33,966
You can traumatize me
with the rest of your dreams.

1810
01:59:34,046 --> 01:59:35,446
No, wait.

1811
01:59:35,486 --> 01:59:39,486
What if Wilton did it, threw the
jewels away, this guy finds them?

1812
01:59:40,926 --> 01:59:44,286
I don't know.
See what tonight's dream tells you.

1813
01:59:44,366 --> 01:59:47,086
I'm sure a jury will be interested.

1814
01:59:47,166 --> 01:59:49,006
Come on.

1815
01:59:50,366 --> 01:59:51,606
I give up.

1816
01:59:51,686 --> 01:59:53,486
I knew Wilton didn't do it.

1817
01:59:53,566 --> 01:59:55,886
He's another poor schmuck
who cheated on his wife.

1818
01:59:55,966 --> 01:59:59,286
When you see those pictures
of Nola Rice, you can see why though.

1819
02:00:00,006 --> 02:00:02,766
What a world. Am I right?

1820
02:00:03,246 --> 02:00:06,206
Careful, careful.
I'm always afraid they'll drop.

1821
02:00:06,286 --> 02:00:09,286
- Oh, chill out, Dad.
- Babies are so, so soft.

1822
02:00:09,366 --> 02:00:11,326
Right. Champagne.

1823
02:00:11,366 --> 02:00:13,606
- I think he's got your eyes, Chloe.
- Really?

1824
02:00:13,686 --> 02:00:16,046
I think he's got
your coloring darling, I really do.

1825
02:00:16,126 --> 02:00:19,366
Mummy, you can't tell anything yet.
They change all the time.

1826
02:00:20,726 --> 02:00:22,286
- My nephew.
- Uncle, Uncle Tom.

1827
02:00:22,366 --> 02:00:25,006
- Oh, look at these flowers.
- No, he does look like Christopher.

1828
02:00:25,086 --> 02:00:28,566
Actually, speaking of which, didn't you
move into Alan Sinclair's old office?

1829
02:00:28,646 --> 02:00:31,006
- You lucky swine.
- Oh, Mummy, look, he's dreaming.

1830
02:00:31,086 --> 02:00:32,566
Let's work on number two. Come on.

1831
02:00:32,646 --> 02:00:36,006
Come on, he is a handsome boy.
Look at that face.

1832
02:00:36,086 --> 02:00:37,326
Yeah, he's gorgeous.

1833
02:00:37,406 --> 02:00:39,446
Right, here we are. Eleanor. Please...

1834
02:00:39,526 --> 02:00:40,886
- Chloe...
- Good stuff, Papa.

1835
02:00:40,926 --> 02:00:42,446
- Thank you, darling. There you are.
- There we go.

1836
02:00:42,526 --> 02:00:44,686
- It's all right, you stay there.
- I'll pass them round, shall I?

1837
02:00:44,726 --> 02:00:45,726
Please do.

1838
02:00:45,806 --> 02:00:46,886
- What a good idea.
- Darling, have one.

1839
02:00:46,926 --> 02:00:49,166
- To Terence Elliot Wilton.
- Yes.

1840
02:00:49,246 --> 02:00:51,646
With parents like Chloe and Chris,

1841
02:00:51,726 --> 02:00:54,526
this child will be great
at anything he sets his mind to.

1842
02:00:54,566 --> 02:00:56,126
- Thank you, Mummy.
- He will. He...

1843
02:00:56,206 --> 02:00:58,126
Do you know what,
I don't care if he's great.

1844
02:00:58,206 --> 02:00:59,526
I just hope that he's lucky.

1845
02:00:59,606 --> 02:01:01,206
- Oh, lovely.
- What a lovely thought.

1846
02:01:01,286 --> 02:01:02,606
- He probably will be.
- Absolutely adorable.

1847
02:01:02,686 --> 02:01:04,526
- Mummy, are you sure I'm allowed this?
- Yes, yes.

1848
02:01:04,606 --> 02:01:07,446
- Yes, of course you are.
- You haven't had any for months.

1849
02:01:07,486 --> 02:01:08,886
I'd get it down you now, while you can.

1850
02:01:08,966 --> 02:01:10,246
Isn't he handsome?
My God, he's handsome.

1851
02:01:10,326 --> 02:01:12,486
Bet you any money
the next one's a girl.

1852
02:01:14,646 --> 02:01:16,046
What are you saying about him?

1853
02:01:16,126 --> 02:01:18,126
I was just saying he's got
the most adorable cheeks.

1854
02:01:18,206 --> 02:01:22,166
We were just saying how handsome he is.
Just so extraordinarily handsome.

1855
02:01:22,246 --> 02:01:23,526
I wonder what he's thinking.

1856
02:01:23,566 --> 02:01:24,846
Well, you know, they said
he was a thinker. The nurses.

1857
02:01:24,926 --> 02:01:26,566
- Deep thoughts. Deep thoughts.
- Here we are.

1858
02:01:26,646 --> 02:01:28,566
- To Terence.
- To Terence.

1859
02:01:28,646 --> 02:01:31,326
- To Terence.
- And all that sail on him.

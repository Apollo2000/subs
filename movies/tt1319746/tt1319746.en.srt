1
00:00:08,723 --> 00:00:11,090
Not another wedding.

2
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,659
Sure they can be lovely,

3
00:00:14,694 --> 00:00:16,327
but when you're a single girl

4
00:00:16,363 --> 00:00:18,763
and most of your friends
are married,

5
00:00:18,798 --> 00:00:21,665
let's just say going to weddings

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,134
can be treacherous.

7
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:26,436
I know Courtney and Steve
mean well,

8
00:00:26,472 --> 00:00:28,771
yet I'm always
at the losers' table.

9

10
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:51,791
Okay okay, I'll behave.

11
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,061
Maybe for once, the guy
they put me next to will be...

12
00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:57,796
Decent.

13
00:00:57,831 --> 00:00:59,264
Weddings.

14
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:01,366
What a joke.

15
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:03,668
Beautiful ceremony, wasn't it?

16
00:01:03,703 --> 00:01:06,003
I couldn't believe they used
"thou shalt obey" in the vows.

17
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:08,105
Who does that?

18
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:10,674
Actually, I was, um...

19
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:12,375
I was just making
a little small talk.

20
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:14,711
Great. They sat me
next to that guy.

21
00:01:15,713 --> 00:01:17,479
What do you mean "that guy"?

22
00:01:17,515 --> 00:01:19,782
Well, I notice you're not
wearing a ring and you're what,

23
00:01:19,817 --> 00:01:21,884
- mid-30s?
- Uh, late 20s...

24
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:23,785
To early 30s.

25
00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:27,088
Let me guess,
you lease a really nice car

26
00:01:27,123 --> 00:01:29,157
you could never buy,
you never cry in movies

27
00:01:29,192 --> 00:01:31,191
and you only bang hot chicks.

28
00:01:31,226 --> 00:01:33,360
- Have we met?
- No.

29
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:41,133
They're perfect for each other.

30
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,105
So why don't you like weddings?

31
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,874
It's a silly fairy tale...
Marrying the man of your dreams

32
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,942
and living happily ever after

33
00:01:51,977 --> 00:01:54,211
in a gingerbread house next
to the field of cotton candy.

34
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:55,946
Yummy.

35
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:57,513
No, I mean there's
no such thing as soulmates.

36
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:00,216
- So you sleep around?
- Sorry.

37
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:02,251
- I'm not your type.
- I don't have a type.

38
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:04,119
- What makes you think I have a type?
- Oh please.

39
00:02:04,154 --> 00:02:06,088
You ever hear the phrase
"the clothes make the man"?

40
00:02:06,123 --> 00:02:07,723
Maybe.

41
00:02:07,758 --> 00:02:10,792
- Well, look at you.
- What?

42
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:14,228
You were invited to a formal wedding but
you obviously couldn't afford a tuxedo,

43
00:02:14,263 --> 00:02:16,831
so you decided you'd get away with
a dark suit and matching tie.

44
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:18,865
Only you don't own a dark suit,
just a Navy blue blazer

45
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,967
which, judging by the width of
the lapel is what, 10 years old?

46
00:02:21,002 --> 00:02:23,002
Not that you couldn't afford
a new one necessarily,

47
00:02:23,038 --> 00:02:25,337
but because you also chose not
to get it cleaned and pressed,

48
00:02:25,372 --> 00:02:27,740
I'm guessing you're one of those
people that just can't be bothered.

49
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:29,408
As long as it fits, why get a new one?
Am I right?

50
00:02:29,443 --> 00:02:31,243
Wow.

51
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:33,377
Which would also explain the jeans
and the stain on your shirt.

52
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:35,079
- May I?
- What are you...

53
00:02:35,115 --> 00:02:37,749
Yeah, just like I thought.
A clip-on.

54
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:40,417
And I bet you're going commando 'cause
you don't like the boys to be tied up.

55
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:43,220
Right?

56
00:02:43,255 --> 00:02:46,889
- Want me to show you?
- Yeah. Hey, show the world, flash.

57
00:02:46,924 --> 00:02:49,091
You don't know me.

58
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:56,197
Hi, can you do me a favor?
Would you mind switching seats with me?

59
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:57,999
I don't think
she'll attack her own.

Do you know
the score on the game?

67
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,845
Thanks.

68
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:17,048
Thank you so much.
Really appreciate it.

69
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:18,550
You're welcome, Steve.

70
00:03:18,585 --> 00:03:20,418
Congratulations, buddy.

71
00:03:20,453 --> 00:03:22,186
Thanks, man.

72
00:03:24,357 --> 00:03:26,056
Do you have service?

73
00:03:26,092 --> 00:03:27,557
May I?

74
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:29,292
How do I know you're
gonna call a 900 number?

75
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:31,995
- I won't.
- Fine.

76
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:39,168
Hey, it's Vince.
Is The Monkey there?

77
00:03:39,203 --> 00:03:41,136
Oh.
How did I do today?

78
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,206
Damn it. Crap.

79
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:48,975
Yeah, I know The Monkey's
looking for me.

80
00:03:49,011 --> 00:03:52,212
- Thank you.
- So how much do you owe?

81
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,848
I don't know what
you're talking about.

82
00:03:55,883 --> 00:03:58,384
You don't realize how transparent you are.

83
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:01,420
Either you owe money or you're
being stalked by a monkey.

84
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:04,556
It's not a monkey,
it's The Monkey.

85
00:04:04,591 --> 00:04:07,592
So how much
do you owe The Monkey?

86
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:10,828
Enough.

87
00:04:10,863 --> 00:04:12,596
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

88
00:04:15,434 --> 00:04:17,300
How big a haul would you say
they're going to take in?

89
00:04:17,335 --> 00:04:20,169
Have you seen their registry?
Who needs a $600 towel warmer?

90
00:04:20,205 --> 00:04:22,238
People say gambling's
throwing your money away.

91
00:04:22,273 --> 00:04:23,839
Plus, when I tried
to get them something

92
00:04:23,874 --> 00:04:25,941
almost all the gifts
had already been bought.

93
00:04:25,976 --> 00:04:27,843
And you should see the pile of gifts
she got at the bridal shower.

94
00:04:27,878 --> 00:04:29,344
I bet if you add it up,
over the years I've spent...

95
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:31,045
$20 grand in wedding gifts.

96
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,113
Yeah.
Yeah, at least.

97
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:36,417
I guess in theory
it's like a savings account.

98
00:04:36,452 --> 00:04:38,384
You know, we're supposed
to get that money back one day

99
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,353
- when we get married?
- We?

100
00:04:40,388 --> 00:04:42,055
Like I'd ever marry
a guy like you.

101
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,922
Really?

102
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,624
I was kinda hoping
we could grow old together.

103
00:04:51,497 --> 00:04:53,497
Whoo.

104
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:56,167
Besides the hernia
and the back spasms,

105
00:04:56,202 --> 00:04:58,001
I think that went very well.

106
00:04:58,036 --> 00:05:01,104
I owe you one.
Moving is the biggest drag there is.

107
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,206
- So are you still scared?
- I have no margin for error.

108
00:05:03,242 --> 00:05:06,075
I put all my savings
into the down payment.

109
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,643
What if I get laid off?

110
00:05:07,678 --> 00:05:09,979
- Am I crazy for doing this?
- Look...

111
00:05:10,014 --> 00:05:13,047
You've been saving for six
years to buy your first place.

112
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,216
I mean, you'll be fine
as long as you don't

113
00:05:15,252 --> 00:05:18,019
buy food or gas or,
god forbid, turn on a light.

114
00:05:18,054 --> 00:05:20,153
Ah, well, that whole food
thing is overrated.

115
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:22,923
I just... I'm really gonna miss this place.

116
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,524
Seven years, three boyfriends,

117
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,260
four crash diets.

118
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:29,028
That cabbage
and cayenne pepper thing

119
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:30,997
almost killed me.

120
00:05:31,032 --> 00:05:32,597
I'm just gonna go take
one last look around.

121
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:36,201
All right. I'll use
the little boys' room.

122
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,870
It's great that you're moving into
Courtney and Steve's building.

123
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:41,205
Yeah, I wouldn't have found
the apartment otherwise.

124
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,507
I meant that they'll be there to
help us unload on the other end.

125
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:45,542
Don't you wish?

126
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,477
They're still
on their honeymoon.

127
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:51,648
- I'll meet you outside.
- Okay.

128
00:06:01,391 --> 00:06:04,225
- Uh, Jennifer?
- All right, I'll put it back.

129
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,160
Can I show you something?

130
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:09,396
What happened?

131
00:06:09,431 --> 00:06:11,164
There's a slight possibility

132
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,966
that I might have left
the keys in the ignition.

133
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:17,336
You are no longer
my gay boyfriend.

134
00:06:57,472 --> 00:06:59,639
Be the coffee-maker.
Be the coffee-maker.

135
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:22,158
The Monkey sends his regards.

136
00:07:22,194 --> 00:07:25,194
Fellas, how sweet.
You decided to stop by, huh?

137
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:26,695
A phone call would've
sufficed, really.

138
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:28,530
Yeah, listen.
You got something for him?

139
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:30,432
You have to tell The Monkey
I need some more time.

140
00:07:32,102 --> 00:07:34,969
Fellas, come on.
There's gotta be a choice.

141
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:37,637
- There's always a choice, right?
- Yeah, we can leave you

142
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:39,473
in here on the floor
in a crumpled mess

143
00:07:39,508 --> 00:07:42,576
or out there on the tracks.
I'll let you decide.

144
00:07:42,611 --> 00:07:44,344
Those the only choices?

145
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,317
- Okay.
- That's a bad cough, Vince.

146
00:07:51,352 --> 00:07:53,284
You might want
to get that checked out.

147
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,320
Now we'll be back next week.

148
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:57,489
Either you have
the money by then or...

149
00:07:57,524 --> 00:08:01,258
Let me guess,
it'll be monkey business?

150
00:08:01,293 --> 00:08:04,094
I was just gonna say break some
bones, but that was way more clever.

151
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,396
You know, you're smarter
than you look.

152
00:08:06,431 --> 00:08:08,164
You guys are really
a cliché, you know that?

153
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:10,099
- We are not.
- Are too.

154
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:12,300
We are not!

155
00:08:12,336 --> 00:08:14,102
Let's get out of here.

156
00:08:41,628 --> 00:08:44,028
Congratulations.

157
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:46,764
- Excuse me?
- Oh well, I couldn't help but notice.

158
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,498
You know, there's
an easier way to do that.

159
00:08:48,534 --> 00:08:50,367
Everything is computerized
these days.

160
00:08:50,402 --> 00:08:53,503
So just choose what you want,
aim the gun at the bar code

161
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:56,338
and pull the trigger.
It's a lot of fun.

Hey, it's Courtney. Leave me a message.

175
00:09:51,855 --> 00:09:53,754
Hey Courtney, it's Jennifer.

176
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,157
I hope you guys are having
a great time on your honeymoon.

177
00:09:56,192 --> 00:09:58,825
But listen, um,
there was a guy at the wedding,

178
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:00,694
I think his name was Vince.

179
00:10:00,729 --> 00:10:02,729
Well, we were talking
and I just...

180
00:10:02,764 --> 00:10:04,697
I have some information for him.

181
00:10:04,732 --> 00:10:07,199
So no big deal, but you know,

182
00:10:07,235 --> 00:10:09,301
if you could call me back with
his number that'd be great.

183
00:10:09,337 --> 00:10:11,136
Thanks.

184
00:10:14,107 --> 00:10:16,774
Ooh, The Monkey guy.

185
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:21,411
Hi, is...
Is Monkey there?

186
00:10:21,447 --> 00:10:23,213
- It's The Monkey.
- What?

187
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:25,248
- You heard me.
- The Monkey?

188
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:27,116
- You're the kidding, right?
- No, I'm not kidding.

189
00:10:27,152 --> 00:10:29,252
- Oh, sorry.
- Who is this?

190
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:32,420
Listen, a guy named Vince called
you the other day from my phone.

191
00:10:32,456 --> 00:10:35,090
I really need to talk to him,
but I don't have his number.

192
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:38,626
- Yeah, I'll give it to you.
- Oh, that's great. Thanks.

193
00:10:38,661 --> 00:10:41,328
- You're very the kind.
- What are you, smart?

194
00:10:41,364 --> 00:10:43,697
- Don't be smart.
- Okay, I won't do it again, I'm sorry.

195
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:45,832
I have to admit. I was a
little surprised you called.

196
00:10:45,867 --> 00:10:47,867
I didn't think you liked me.

197
00:10:47,903 --> 00:10:50,737
- I don't.
- Well, I don't like you either.

198
00:10:50,772 --> 00:10:52,437
Great. Lunch?

199
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:57,209
Did you put it on a credit card?

200
00:10:57,244 --> 00:10:59,610
- Maybe the credit card company insurance will pay for it.
- I checked.

201
00:10:59,646 --> 00:11:01,846
The truck is covered,
but not what was in it.

202
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:04,248
That's too bad.
I still don't see

203
00:11:04,284 --> 00:11:05,850
what all this has
to do with me though.

204
00:11:05,884 --> 00:11:08,351
I was thinking about something
you said at the wedding,

205
00:11:08,387 --> 00:11:11,655
about how the money we put into wedding
gifts is like a savings account.

206
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,589
Well I really need
to make a withdrawal.

207
00:11:13,624 --> 00:11:17,126
Really really can't sleep
another night on throw pillows.

208
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:20,428
- So what I was thinking was...
- I'm in.

209
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:22,463
- Well, I didn't even...
- I'm in. I love it.

210
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:25,800
It's perfect. I'm in.
We stage a fake wedding.

211
00:11:25,835 --> 00:11:27,501
We invite everyone that we know.

212
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:29,469
You register for all the stuff
you want to replace,

213
00:11:29,505 --> 00:11:31,505
I get to keep all the cash.
It's perfect. I'm in.

214
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,773
How long do we have to stay married
in order to keep the gifts?

215
00:11:33,808 --> 00:11:35,841
- So you think it's a good idea?
- Oh! You know what else?

216
00:11:35,877 --> 00:11:38,211
We can turn all
the gifts into cash too.

217
00:11:38,246 --> 00:11:40,879
Take the whole bundle down to the
track, double and triple our money,

218
00:11:40,914 --> 00:11:43,582
furnish your place
like a palace.

219
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:47,452
Check, please!

220
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:49,220
Yeah, this isn't gonna work.
Wedding's off.

221
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:51,455
Wow, talk about
commitment issues.

222
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,524
You're getting cold feet
over our pretend wedding.

223
00:11:55,393 --> 00:11:56,926
Hello.

224
00:11:56,962 --> 00:11:59,596
You're kidding!
Where?

225
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:01,297
That's great.
I'll be right there.

226
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,699
- Have a nice life.
- Wait a minute.

227
00:12:03,734 --> 00:12:06,435
Wait a minute! What about...
What about the money?

228
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,303
Your furniture?

229
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:10,304
Our love?

230
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,616
Be the coffee-maker.
Be the coffee-maker.

231
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,889
So are you thinking D.J. or a band?

232
00:12:45,903 --> 00:12:47,703
- Oh! Here it is.
- Yeah.

233
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:49,605
"Invited guests have an
obligation to send a gift

234
00:12:49,641 --> 00:12:51,873
whether they are
attending or not."

235
00:12:51,908 --> 00:12:55,343
Seriously? That is...
That is awesome.

236
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:57,244
So we need to invite
everyone that we know.

237
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,813
In fact, we should invite
everyone that we've ever met.

238
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:02,016
Especially the rich ones.

239
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:04,851
You know what?
I spilled coffee once on Donald Trump.

240
00:13:04,886 --> 00:13:07,020
Why don't we send a couple of
invites over to Trump Tower,

241
00:13:07,055 --> 00:13:08,721
see what happens?

242
00:13:08,757 --> 00:13:11,490
- Brilliant.
- Thank you.

243
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,258
Okay, just so we're clear...

244
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:15,027
We announce our engagement,
we send out invitations

245
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:17,262
and then just before
the wedding we call it off.

246
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:19,330
I keep all the gifts
for my apartment

247
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,499
- and you keep the cash to pay off your debt.
- It's perfect.

248
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,734
Plus, you know the girls love a
guy who's been left at the altar.

249
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,669
So I will definitely
be seeing some sympathy.

250
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,704
Boom chick-a wah-wah.

251
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:30,340
Wow. I just hope
people will buy

252
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,841
that I've actually lowered my standards this much.

253
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:35,344
So what does it say about calling it off?
I need to know how long

254
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:38,380
we need to keep this charade up? I
really need to pay off The Monkey.

255
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,982
Oh no. "If the couple calls off their
engagement prior to the wedding,

256
00:13:41,017 --> 00:13:43,351
all gifts must be promptly returned."

257
00:13:44,988 --> 00:13:46,486
So wait a minute, what does that mean?

258
00:13:46,522 --> 00:13:48,655
That we have to actually
go through with it?

259
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:51,291
Apparently so.

260
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:53,626
You and I are broke.
We can't afford a wedding.

261
00:13:54,829 --> 00:13:56,529
Yes, we can.

262
00:13:56,564 --> 00:13:58,297
We pretend we're
planning a wedding.

263
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,031
But then as the date approaches,

264
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:02,300
we get overwhelmed by the
details and have to elope.

265
00:14:02,336 --> 00:14:03,802
It's perfect.
We get the gifts,

266
00:14:03,837 --> 00:14:05,570
but without the wedding.

267
00:14:05,605 --> 00:14:07,671
- That could work.
- It will work.

268
00:14:07,707 --> 00:14:10,107
All we have to do is convince
people that we're in love.

269
00:14:11,744 --> 00:14:14,811
Oh god.

270
00:14:14,846 --> 00:14:17,413
No, you know what?
We can do this.

271
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:21,049
We just have to make up a story
about our whirlwind romance.

272
00:14:21,085 --> 00:14:23,985
Yeah, like how I swept you off your
feet with my dashing good looks.

273
00:14:24,021 --> 00:14:25,787
Or something believable.

274
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,823
What, like your
effervescent charm?

275
00:14:28,858 --> 00:14:31,726
No, like we bonded over

276
00:14:31,761 --> 00:14:34,061
something we have in common.

277
00:14:34,097 --> 00:14:35,729
Now what do we have in common?

278
00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:42,568
- Any ideas?
- Not a one.

279
00:14:48,842 --> 00:14:51,042
Well, I guess that's about it.

280
00:14:51,077 --> 00:14:53,511
I'm telling you, pants.
This guy's a real pig.

281
00:14:53,546 --> 00:14:56,680
I know. This is the first
time I've ransacked a place

282
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:59,750
and I left it cleaner
than I found it.

283
00:14:59,785 --> 00:15:01,685
- What did we get, anyway?
- Not much.

284
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,087
A jar of pennies, a stack of
vintage girlie magazines.

285
00:15:06,924 --> 00:15:09,557
Then we're gonna have
to wait until he gets here.

286
00:15:09,593 --> 00:15:11,059
What is that?

287
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:12,761
A dictionary.

288
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:14,829
What was that thing
he called us?

289
00:15:14,865 --> 00:15:18,465
- What do you mean, a cliché?
- Yeah, a cliché.

290
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:22,136
Cliché, cliché.

291
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,905
C-l-e-e-s-h-a-y.

292
00:15:27,909 --> 00:15:29,709
I can't find it.

293
00:15:29,744 --> 00:15:32,911
Look, all I know is
he'd better get here soon.

294
00:15:32,946 --> 00:15:34,746
'Cause if I miss
"Desperate Housewives,"

295
00:15:34,782 --> 00:15:36,615
he's gonna be missing a finger.

296
00:15:41,954 --> 00:15:44,387
Where is that boy?

297
00:16:04,973 --> 00:16:07,040
Hello?

298
00:16:07,075 --> 00:16:10,076
- Honey, I'm home.
- Did you leave something here,

299
00:16:10,112 --> 00:16:12,144
like your pride?

300
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,780
- Just let me in.
- I'm in my pajamas.

301
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:17,149
Ooh, how exciting.

302
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,950
Just let me in or I'm
calling off the wedding.

303
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,722
No. No.
No no no no no.

304
00:16:25,758 --> 00:16:27,791
That was not part of the deal.
You cannot stay here.

305
00:16:27,827 --> 00:16:29,927
- Do you remember The Monkey?
- Yeah, who could forget?

306
00:16:29,962 --> 00:16:33,196
Right now there are two gorillas
outside my apartment waiting for me.

307
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:35,731
Do you want to become a widow before
you ever get your shower gifts?

308
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:37,099
Have you heard of these
things called friends?

309
00:16:37,135 --> 00:16:38,734
They come in really handy
at times like this.

310
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,769
I have a lot of friends,
thank you very much.

311
00:16:40,804 --> 00:16:43,505
I just owe them all money.

312
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,207
Oh, wow.
You're living the dream.

313
00:16:45,242 --> 00:16:47,775
It'll be one night.
You won't even know I'm here.

314
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:53,446
Fine. One night.

315
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,649
What's with the gloves,
Minnie Mouse?

316
00:16:56,685 --> 00:16:58,518
Uh, they're moisturizing gloves.

317
00:16:58,553 --> 00:17:00,586
Right. It's probably
a good idea at your age.

318
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:18,435
- Honey, where are you going?
- To see Jennifer.

319
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,604
I told you, she called
and asked for Vince's number.

320
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,837
It's 8:00 in the morning!

321
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:23,873
We have been in Fiji for two weeks.

322
00:17:23,908 --> 00:17:25,441
I'm sure that she's dying to see him.

323
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:27,176
This is no time to be selfish, sweetie.

324
00:17:27,211 --> 00:17:29,511
Uh, a little help?

325
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:32,647
How insensitive of me.

326
00:17:32,682 --> 00:17:35,182
I completely forgot.

327
00:17:35,217 --> 00:17:37,184
Her housewarming gift.
Thanks, honey.

328
00:17:48,862 --> 00:17:50,729
Jennifer.

329
00:17:53,634 --> 00:17:55,567
Jennifer, someone's at the door.

330
00:18:11,749 --> 00:18:13,949
Jennifer.

331
00:18:15,085 --> 00:18:16,884
J...

332
00:18:29,531 --> 00:18:31,030
Hello?

333
00:18:31,065 --> 00:18:32,798
Hello.

334
00:18:34,201 --> 00:18:36,168
Hello.

335
00:18:38,138 --> 00:18:41,306
Vince, I can see you.

336
00:18:42,576 --> 00:18:44,208
Let me in.

337
00:18:48,747 --> 00:18:51,480
Hey. You're... you're back
from your honeymoon, huh?

338
00:18:51,516 --> 00:18:53,516
Just got back.

339
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:55,251
And you're...

340
00:18:56,321 --> 00:18:57,887
Here.

341
00:18:57,922 --> 00:19:00,021
Yeah. Yeah.

342
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:03,725
So, uh, what's...

343
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:06,293
What's new?

344
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:09,029
Married.

345
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,998
What's new with you?

346
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:13,866
Oh, not much.

347
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,569
I... I woke up yesterday and
my stomach was a little upset.

348
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:19,038
Vince, you tell me
about Jennifer.

349
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,540
- Her stomach's fine.
- Stop playing games.

350
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:23,575
I mean it... it looks like you
two have really hit it off.

351
00:19:23,611 --> 00:19:25,544
Yeah.

352
00:19:25,579 --> 00:19:28,212
Yeah, we... we did.
She's great. Great.

353
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:31,716
She... you know,
we realized we had...

354
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:33,617
- Something in common.
- See, I knew it!

355
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:35,585
Jennifer!

356
00:19:36,888 --> 00:19:38,588
- Is she here?
- No.

357
00:19:38,624 --> 00:19:40,623
She... left.

358
00:19:40,658 --> 00:19:43,692
- Oh, she went to work?
- Yes.

359
00:19:43,728 --> 00:19:46,228
Yes, she did. Work...
That's where she went.

360
00:19:46,263 --> 00:19:47,996
She's there working at work.

361
00:19:48,031 --> 00:19:49,931
At her job.
That's what she, you know,

362
00:19:49,966 --> 00:19:51,899
that's what she does.
That box looks awfully heavy.

363
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,201
Can I take that from you?

364
00:19:55,638 --> 00:19:57,671
Huh.

365
00:19:57,706 --> 00:20:00,307
You know, I would have thought she
would have moved her stuff in by now.

366
00:20:00,342 --> 00:20:02,675
I know, I know.
It's a very long story actually.

367
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,311
One that I'm sure she would
love to tell you herself.

368
00:20:10,684 --> 00:20:12,717
Damn it. Um,
I have to take this.

369
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,586
Can you just give me
one moment please?

370
00:20:17,156 --> 00:20:18,856
- Hello, Monkey?
- Monkey here.

371
00:20:18,891 --> 00:20:21,225
Monkey?
Oh, that is so sweet.

372
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,660
- Is that Jennifer? Let me talk to her.
- No. No no no no.

373
00:20:23,695 --> 00:20:25,762
This... this...
This is my mom.

374
00:20:27,766 --> 00:20:29,965
I call her Monkey
because of her...

375
00:20:31,602 --> 00:20:33,935
Face.

376
00:20:33,971 --> 00:20:36,303
It's kinda personal. Can you
just give me one moment, please?

377
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:39,106
- Yeah.
- Thank you. Thank you.

378
00:20:39,142 --> 00:20:40,975
- Hey, I'm sorry. Yeah.
- You better be sorry.

379
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,709
No, I'm...
I'm with someone.

380
00:20:42,744 --> 00:20:44,277
I was wondering,
can I come over personally

381
00:20:44,312 --> 00:20:46,646
and talk to you about my plan?

382
00:20:47,983 --> 00:20:49,782
Yes. Yes.

383
00:20:49,817 --> 00:20:51,817
I just got engaged.

384
00:20:52,987 --> 00:20:55,187
No.
No, that is the plan.

385
00:20:55,222 --> 00:20:58,289
- I'm getting married.
- Married?

386
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:00,992
Thanks, Vince.
I've got to go.

387
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:03,027
I'll see you later.

388
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,630
No, but this plan's gonna work.

389
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,709
Excuse me. The white
one goes in recycling.

390
00:21:29,018 --> 00:21:30,718
Nice day for a walk.

391
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,056
- I thought you said walk.
- Oh, come on, Vince.

392
00:21:38,092 --> 00:21:39,958
You're getting married.
You need the exercise.

393
00:21:39,993 --> 00:21:42,127
Besides, it's gonna thin your
face out for the pictures.

394
00:21:42,162 --> 00:21:44,296
- Did wonders for me.
- You do look great.

395
00:21:44,331 --> 00:21:46,931
- Why, thank you, Vince.
- All right, wait a minute.

396
00:21:46,966 --> 00:21:48,999
Wait a minute.

397
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:54,037
Where are we going?

398
00:21:54,072 --> 00:21:56,439
- The Monkey wants to see you.
- He didn't want to send a car?

399
00:21:56,475 --> 00:21:58,074
The Monkey's gone green.

400
00:22:00,244 --> 00:22:02,444
- Hey, how do you spell cliché?
- What?

401
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,446
You got wax in your ears?
That's a simple question.

402
00:22:04,482 --> 00:22:06,147
How do you spell cliché?

403
00:22:06,182 --> 00:22:07,782
C-l-i-c-h-e.

404
00:22:07,817 --> 00:22:09,851
Show me.

405
00:22:11,521 --> 00:22:13,887
Hey, this is...
This is my dictionary.

406
00:22:13,922 --> 00:22:16,223
- Told you.
- No it isn't.

407
00:22:16,258 --> 00:22:18,725
I bought it at a flea market.

408
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:21,827
"To Vince, on the occasion
of his high school graduation.

409
00:22:21,863 --> 00:22:23,395
I am so proud of you.

410
00:22:23,431 --> 00:22:25,097
Love, mom."

411
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:26,931
Coincidence.

412
00:22:26,967 --> 00:22:29,734
Look, just consider it interest
on the loan. Now show him.

413
00:22:34,173 --> 00:22:35,939
Right here.

414
00:22:43,348 --> 00:22:45,248
"Cliché...

415
00:22:45,283 --> 00:22:47,450
A very predictable or un..."

416
00:22:47,485 --> 00:22:51,453
- Unoriginal.
- "Unoriginable person or thing."

417
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:55,790
- You think I'm predictable?
- Yeah, I do.

418
00:22:55,825 --> 00:22:57,324
What am I gonna do now?

419
00:22:59,162 --> 00:23:01,828
Punch me in the face.

420
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:03,797
Wrong.

421
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:05,799
- I'm gonna punch you in the shoulder.
- Ow!

422
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:07,100
Vince.

423
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,234
Man, you gonna need
some ice on that.

424
00:23:23,248 --> 00:23:25,448
You think I'm an idiot,
don't you?

425
00:23:25,484 --> 00:23:29,285
I'm just some dumb monkey that'll
fall for this stupid scheme?

426
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,154
Look, I'm gonna
get your money, okay?

427
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,957
I've known you for the past,
what, five years, Vince?

428
00:23:34,992 --> 00:23:37,125
- Yeah.
- In all that time,

429
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,961
I've never seen you
have a steady girlfriend.

430
00:23:39,996 --> 00:23:42,230
You're looser with your women
then you are with your money.

431
00:23:42,265 --> 00:23:44,131
This wedding
is different than that.

432
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,033
So excuse me if I just don't buy

433
00:23:46,068 --> 00:23:48,001
that you're ready
for a lifelong commitment.

434
00:23:48,037 --> 00:23:50,102
Which means...

435
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:52,805
You're either lying to your
girl or you're lying to me.

436
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:55,141
Or maybe he's lying
to both of us.

437
00:23:55,176 --> 00:23:57,042
Jennifer? What...

438
00:23:57,077 --> 00:23:58,844
What are you doing here?

439
00:23:58,879 --> 00:24:00,846
I thought you were
done with this, Vince.

440
00:24:00,881 --> 00:24:02,547
- Done with what?
- Done with the gambling.

441
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:04,415
You told me you'd
never do it again

442
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,984
and here you are,
being held at gunpoint.

443
00:24:08,921 --> 00:24:10,855
I'm sorry, I'm Jennifer.
I didn't get your name.

444
00:24:10,889 --> 00:24:13,289
I'm, uh...

445
00:24:16,061 --> 00:24:17,527
It's Eugene.

446
00:24:17,562 --> 00:24:19,595
Eugene?

447
00:24:21,866 --> 00:24:23,799
- But you can call me Monkey.
- Oh, Mr. Monkey.

448
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:25,266
We spoke on the phone.

449
00:24:25,301 --> 00:24:27,134
You gave me Vince's
number, remember?

450
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:30,104
- I do.
- You have a very nice phone voice.

451
00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:33,006
Thank you.

452
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:36,209
Now how are we supposed to start a
life together if I can't trust you?

453
00:24:36,245 --> 00:24:39,144
- How much does he owe?
- $15 grand plus interest.

454
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,580
So what are we talking about?

455
00:24:41,616 --> 00:24:44,183
- 8% compounded weekly? Monthly?
- I'm not really sure.

456
00:24:44,218 --> 00:24:46,551
- My accountant kinda handles...
- It really doesn't matter.

457
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:49,187
What matters is I'm here, Vince,

458
00:24:49,222 --> 00:24:51,956
and I know about your debt
and your philandering past

459
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:53,924
and I'm here to help.

460
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,293
But we have to be completely
honest with one another.

461
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,862
No more...
No more secrets.

462
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:00,463
She's got a point, Vince.

463
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,164
Yeah, man, she does. Listen to her.

464
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,966
She's very supportive.

465
00:25:07,471 --> 00:25:09,271
Okay.

466
00:25:09,306 --> 00:25:11,640
That's all you've got to say?

467
00:25:12,876 --> 00:25:14,408
No more secrets.

468
00:25:14,443 --> 00:25:16,243
I will never lie to you again.

469
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:19,914
I just wanted to give you that...
That honeymoon in Italy.

470
00:25:19,949 --> 00:25:24,217
Well, I guess our vacation will just
have to turn into a "staycation."

471
00:25:24,252 --> 00:25:26,886
But you know, Rome can't
compare to our morning cuddles.

472
00:25:26,922 --> 00:25:30,122
- I love to spoon, man
- I love pillow talk.

473
00:25:30,157 --> 00:25:32,224
Well, Mr. Monkey... Eugene,

474
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:35,026
we'll be in touch about Vince's
debt right after the wedding.

475
00:25:35,061 --> 00:25:37,161
I gotta get
this guy out of here.

476
00:25:37,196 --> 00:25:39,130
He's meeting the parents tonight.

477
00:25:39,165 --> 00:25:41,231
Vince, you want me
to shoot you now, man?

478
00:25:41,266 --> 00:25:45,035
Hey, don't make him any more
nervous than he already is.

479
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:49,305
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Wait a minute.

480
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,207
I expect an invitation
to the wedding.

481
00:25:52,243 --> 00:25:54,276
Plus two guests.

482
00:25:54,312 --> 00:25:57,211
- Actually, we were thinking about elo...
- Okay, sure!

483
00:25:57,247 --> 00:25:59,447
- Uh, fish or beef?
- Beef.

484
00:25:59,482 --> 00:26:00,949
Fish for me.

485
00:26:00,984 --> 00:26:03,216
I'm watching my girlish figure.

486
00:26:03,252 --> 00:26:05,519
Oh, and you got a month
to get this done.

487
00:26:05,554 --> 00:26:07,888
- A month?
- Uh, I'm not sure it can happen that soon.

488
00:26:07,923 --> 00:26:10,623
Sometimes you have to book a year in
advance just to reserve the space.

489
00:26:10,658 --> 00:26:12,959
I'm sentimental,
but I'm not stupid.

490
00:26:12,994 --> 00:26:15,994
One month. And under
the circumstances,

491
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:18,496
the sweetness clause
will be in effect.

492
00:26:18,532 --> 00:26:21,066
- The sweetness clause?
- A technicality.

493
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:23,200
Nothing to concern
yourself with.

494
00:26:23,235 --> 00:26:26,270
Now Vince, give this
lovely lady a kiss.

495
00:26:26,305 --> 00:26:29,006
I mean, after all,
she did save your life.

496
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:32,375
- We don't believe in public displays of affection.
- Yeah, it's tacky.

497
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,510
Yeah, it is.
Very much against that.

498
00:26:34,546 --> 00:26:37,446
Well you're gonna have to kiss her
in front of everyone you know.

499
00:26:37,481 --> 00:26:39,181
You might as well
start practicing.

500
00:26:45,154 --> 00:26:49,290
Come on, she's your
fiancée, not your cousin.

501
00:26:49,325 --> 00:26:51,291
Give her a kiss.

502
00:26:59,266 --> 00:27:01,900
- Yeah, that's what's up.
- That's more like it.

503
00:27:01,936 --> 00:27:04,236
You've got yourself
a good lady, Vince.

504
00:27:04,271 --> 00:27:06,604
I don't know how you did it,
but you did it.

505
00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:08,573
It'd be a shame if she was a widow

506
00:27:08,608 --> 00:27:10,375
before she got married.

507
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,443
You got one month.
Not a day more.

508
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:17,080
Oh, and Vince, good luck
with the in-laws!

509
00:27:19,217 --> 00:27:21,650
- Tell 'em I said hi!
- Hey, Eugene, that was nice

510
00:27:21,686 --> 00:27:24,253
- Monkey! Monkey!
- Yeah.

511
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:28,023
What are you doing?

512
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:36,130
One month?
Everyone's going to think I'm pregnant.

513
00:27:36,165 --> 00:27:37,631
We might be killed by gangsters

514
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:39,332
and that's what
you're worried about?

515
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:41,267
I take my reputation
very seriously.

516
00:27:41,302 --> 00:27:43,936
Trust me, the last thing anyone
would call you is loose.

517
00:27:43,972 --> 00:27:46,005
And what is that
supposed to mean?

518
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,706
We have bigger
fish to fry, okay?

519
00:27:47,741 --> 00:27:50,042
Like how are we
gonna afford the wedding?

520
00:27:50,077 --> 00:27:52,277
Wait a minute. Aren't the bride's
parents supposed to pay?

521
00:27:52,312 --> 00:27:56,013
No way. We are not asking my parents
to pay for our fake wedding.

522
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,748
We'll just have to figure
something else out.

523
00:27:57,784 --> 00:28:00,250
Besides, they're still
freaking out that I'm engaged.

524
00:28:00,285 --> 00:28:01,818
How did they find out?

525
00:28:01,853 --> 00:28:04,154
Courtney told Lisa,
who told her mother,

526
00:28:04,189 --> 00:28:07,256
who told her podiatrist, who told
my Aunt Dolly, who told my mother.

527
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,026
What did they say?

528
00:28:11,062 --> 00:28:13,562
I think her exact words
were "miracles do happen."

529
00:28:14,998 --> 00:28:17,965
They got you pegged.

530
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:20,935
Listen, my parents aren't the easiest
people in the world to get along with.

531
00:28:20,969 --> 00:28:23,103
So just try not to say anything
that's gonna tick them off

532
00:28:23,138 --> 00:28:24,704
or make them suspicious or...

533
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,406
Let me do all the talking, okay?

534
00:28:26,442 --> 00:28:29,075
The less they know
about you, the better.

535
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:32,111
I see. This really has nothing to do
with your parents at all, does it?

536
00:28:32,146 --> 00:28:35,113
It has to do with me. You don't think
your parents are gonna like me, do you?

537
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:37,348
No, I know they're not
going to like you.

538
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:40,418
- They're gonna think I'm crazy.
- Please, I'm a catch.

539
00:28:40,454 --> 00:28:42,586
Oh, please. You're like
a 30-year-old man-child

540
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:46,056
who has no friends, no money in the
bank and no apparent ambition.

541
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:48,392
My parents will be so proud.

542
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:52,795
We'll see.

543
00:28:57,601 --> 00:28:59,701
Remember, no talking.

544
00:28:59,736 --> 00:29:02,237
You're my mute fiancé.

545
00:29:02,272 --> 00:29:04,338
Mom!

546
00:29:04,373 --> 00:29:07,708
Hey, there she is.
Oh my goodness.

547
00:29:07,743 --> 00:29:11,010
I cannot believe this! Forget that, give me a hug.

548
00:29:11,046 --> 00:29:12,779
Wow, it is so good
to meet you, really.

549
00:29:12,814 --> 00:29:14,747
I mean, I have heard so much
about you, it's ridiculous.

550
00:29:14,783 --> 00:29:16,582
Oh my god, show me the ring!
Show me the ring!

551
00:29:16,617 --> 00:29:18,317
Uh... the ring?

552
00:29:18,352 --> 00:29:21,086
Actually, um, mom,
there is no ring.

553
00:29:21,122 --> 00:29:23,521
Oh, seriously.
Come on, where's the ring?

554
00:29:23,556 --> 00:29:25,356
No, there...
There is no ring.

555
00:29:25,391 --> 00:29:27,158
Jennifer and I
were talking about it

556
00:29:27,193 --> 00:29:28,726
and we decided to wait
until we could afford

557
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:31,128
to buy the type
of ring that she deserves.

558
00:29:31,163 --> 00:29:33,697
One as beautiful as her spirit, which
I can tell she got from her mother.

559
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:35,398
Enough.

560
00:29:35,434 --> 00:29:37,733
Ow. Dad!

561
00:29:37,768 --> 00:29:40,302
- Hey!
- Wow, he is really spirited.

562
00:29:40,338 --> 00:29:42,771
- Yeah.
- Sweetie, is that the dress I gave you?

563
00:29:42,807 --> 00:29:44,672
Yeah, actually, it is.

564
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:47,442
Oh, how strange.
It just looked so...

565
00:29:47,477 --> 00:29:49,444
Different on the hanger.

566
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:52,146
Just goes to show, you
should always try things on.

567
00:29:55,284 --> 00:29:57,718
That's Jennifer's
sister Bonnie's wedding.

568
00:29:57,753 --> 00:30:00,586
- And that's her husband will.
- And these are our grandbabies.

569
00:30:00,622 --> 00:30:03,022
There's Jonathan and Samantha.

570
00:30:03,057 --> 00:30:05,657
They are so adorable, I just wanna
grab those pictures and eat 'em.

571
00:30:05,692 --> 00:30:08,360
- Oh yeah.
- Perhaps we'll have some more grandkids soon.

572
00:30:08,395 --> 00:30:10,662
- Hmm?
- Honey, should you be drinking?

573
00:30:10,697 --> 00:30:14,064
Mom, I told you
I'm not pregnant.

574
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,334
You know, it's crazy. I never even
knew that Jennifer had a sister.

575
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,102
Oh, wait till you meet her.

576
00:30:19,137 --> 00:30:20,770
You're gonna love her.
Everyone does.

577
00:30:20,805 --> 00:30:23,206
She was voted "most popular"
at slauson county high school.

578
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:25,441
Oh, I have that
yearbook somewhere.

579
00:30:25,477 --> 00:30:28,410
Oh, hon, I'm sure Vince would rather see
pictures of Jennifer from high school.

580
00:30:28,445 --> 00:30:31,613
- We put those in the attic.
- Oh, that's right.

581
00:30:31,649 --> 00:30:33,814
Well, here's one of my
graduation day from Harvard.

582
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:36,784
Right. That was a proud day for all of us.

583
00:30:36,819 --> 00:30:38,619
Oh, well.
Come on, son, let's eat.

584
00:30:38,655 --> 00:30:40,487
- You hungry?
- Uh, yeah.

585
00:30:40,522 --> 00:30:42,289
Probably a long ride
over here, wasn't it?

586
00:30:42,324 --> 00:30:44,858
It was, yeah.

587
00:30:51,132 --> 00:30:53,432
Thank you so much for having me here tonight.

588
00:30:53,467 --> 00:30:57,101
Your home is
absolutely gorgeous.

589
00:30:57,137 --> 00:30:59,504
I don't think I've ever
seen a home so beautiful.

590
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:01,838
- That's so sweet.
- Did you pay somebody to decorate it?

591
00:31:01,874 --> 00:31:04,074
- No no.
- I know you paid somebody to decorate it.

592
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:06,310
- This place looks like a magazine.
- Honey, great dinner.

593
00:31:06,345 --> 00:31:08,511
Amazing. You're one hell
of a cook, I'll tell ya.

594
00:31:08,546 --> 00:31:10,746
So Vince, what do you
do for a living?

595
00:31:10,782 --> 00:31:12,882
That is a good question, Dad.

596
00:31:12,917 --> 00:31:14,783
- What do you do for a living, Vince?
- You don't know?

597
00:31:14,818 --> 00:31:18,486
Well, I... yeah, I just
love to hear him explain it.

598
00:31:20,624 --> 00:31:23,190
I'm in investment management.

599
00:31:23,226 --> 00:31:26,794
I analyze risk and reward and weigh them
against each other to maximize gain.

600
00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:28,861
You know, I have a little
investment money set aside.

601
00:31:28,897 --> 00:31:31,297
Have you got some
inside advice for me, vinny?

602
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:32,799
I've got a lot of ideas.
How much you got?

603
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:35,101
Vince, what are you doing?

604
00:31:35,136 --> 00:31:37,369
Just trying to help out Dad.

605
00:31:37,404 --> 00:31:39,271
What about your family?

606
00:31:39,306 --> 00:31:41,440
We should have them
over for dinner.

607
00:31:41,475 --> 00:31:44,475
Better yet, why not have us
all over to your new place?

608
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,544
Oh, we're dying to see it.

609
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:48,279
I don't have a family.

610
00:31:48,314 --> 00:31:51,448
I'm so sorry.

611
00:31:51,483 --> 00:31:54,184
- I grew up in a foster home.
- Oh, Vince.

612
00:31:54,219 --> 00:31:55,685
Why didn't you tell us?

613
00:31:55,721 --> 00:31:57,886
Vince really doesn't
like to talk about it.

614
00:31:57,922 --> 00:32:00,823
Oh, it's... it's okay, sweetheart.
We're with family now.

615
00:32:00,858 --> 00:32:03,791
No, there were actually four other
children that lived there too.

616
00:32:03,827 --> 00:32:06,527
There was Jo, Natalie...

617
00:32:06,563 --> 00:32:10,131
Blair and of course
sweet little Tootie.

618
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:11,832
Yeah, we were guided through
trials of adolescence

619
00:32:11,867 --> 00:32:14,668
by the tender hand
of Mrs. Garrett.

620
00:32:14,703 --> 00:32:17,603
We called her Mrs. G.

621
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:20,906
You know, Mrs. G
always taught us to

622
00:32:20,942 --> 00:32:22,742
take the good

623
00:32:22,777 --> 00:32:24,776
and then take the bad...

624
00:32:25,846 --> 00:32:28,580
And then take them both.

625
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,549
And there you have it.

626
00:32:32,585 --> 00:32:34,785
- Wow, it's almost like a song.
- Yeah?

627
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,654
Sounds like a wise woman.

628
00:32:36,689 --> 00:32:39,422
I can't wait to meet her.
Does she live in the area?

629
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,859
Who? Oh, my mother?
Yes.

630
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:45,227
- Yeah.
- She does, right outside the city.

631
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:47,529
- Actually in the complete opposite direction.
- Wonderful.

632
00:32:47,564 --> 00:32:49,164
Find out when it would be
convenient for her.

633
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:51,733
Oh, mom, I haven't
met her yet myself.

634
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:54,769
Who gets married
without meeting the parents?

635
00:32:57,573 --> 00:32:59,873
I guess we do.

636
00:33:03,245 --> 00:33:06,312
Oh, listen,
when you meet Mrs. G...

637
00:33:06,347 --> 00:33:08,580
You know, don't mention
the whole foster home thing.

638
00:33:08,616 --> 00:33:10,549
She gets extremely
sensitive about it.

639
00:33:10,584 --> 00:33:12,817
'Cause she always likes to
think of me as her real son.

640
00:33:12,852 --> 00:33:14,919
Oh, that is so lovely.

641
00:33:14,954 --> 00:33:17,755
- Our lips are sealed.
- Thanks.

642
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:19,823
Sweetie, would you help me
with the dessert?

643
00:33:19,858 --> 00:33:22,526
- Ooh.
- Sure, mom.

644
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:27,530
See you in a minute,
honey. Whoo!

645
00:33:34,905 --> 00:33:37,539
I'll tell you, Dad. It's... it's
really great to get a sense of where

646
00:33:37,574 --> 00:33:39,307
Jennifer comes from.

647
00:33:39,343 --> 00:33:41,241
Is she pregnant?
Tell me the truth.

648
00:33:42,278 --> 00:33:44,411
- No, she isn't.
- Damn.

649
00:33:44,447 --> 00:33:46,547
Why does that girl
not hear her clock ticking?

650
00:33:46,582 --> 00:33:48,314
I mean, everybody else does.

651
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,216
- Tick-tock, tick-tock.
- Yeah.

652
00:33:50,251 --> 00:33:51,918
It's more like a bong!

653
00:33:51,953 --> 00:33:53,686
Bong!

654
00:33:53,722 --> 00:33:55,520
- You get that right.
- Oh, up high.

655
00:33:57,558 --> 00:33:59,491
You know, Vince, you seem
like a really decent guy.

656
00:33:59,526 --> 00:34:01,692
And I gotta say I have not
seen Jennifer this happy

657
00:34:01,728 --> 00:34:03,327
in a long time.

658
00:34:03,363 --> 00:34:05,396
Really? She... she
seems happy to you?

659
00:34:05,431 --> 00:34:07,965
Yeah, this is the happiest
I've seen her in years.

660
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,766
Wow.

661
00:34:09,801 --> 00:34:11,935
Hon, can you come
in the kitchen?

662
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:14,571
Pot holders are
in the bottom drawer!

663
00:34:14,606 --> 00:34:17,806
Memory. First thing to go.
After the sex of course.

664
00:34:19,377 --> 00:34:21,977
I can't find 'em.

665
00:34:22,012 --> 00:34:23,711
Okay.

666
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:28,449
Now you two lovebirds try and
keep your hands off each other.

667
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:30,016
Okay, Dad.

668
00:34:32,688 --> 00:34:34,821
Ow! Why do you keep doing that?

669
00:34:34,857 --> 00:34:37,556
Thanks to you we have
to have both our parents

670
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:39,759
over to my completely empty
apartment for a meet and greet.

671
00:34:39,794 --> 00:34:41,527
What happens when your mom
shows up with your dad?

672
00:34:41,562 --> 00:34:43,395
You're not gonna have
to worry about it

673
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:44,996
because my dad left my mom
and me when I was a kid.

674
00:34:45,031 --> 00:34:46,965
What, let me guess,
"one day at a time"?

675
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,900
Your sister was
Valerie Bertinelli?

676
00:34:48,935 --> 00:34:51,635
No, seriously. My dad
left me when I was a kid.

677
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,704
He, you know, tried to get
back into my life

678
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:56,874
when I was a teenager but it
didn't really go over so well.

679
00:34:56,908 --> 00:34:58,608
So, you know,

680
00:34:58,643 --> 00:35:00,943
never really
seen each other since.

681
00:35:03,947 --> 00:35:07,482
Jennifer, we are paying
for your wedding.

682
00:35:07,518 --> 00:35:09,317
Oh, no no no.
I said we'd take care of it.

683
00:35:09,353 --> 00:35:11,619
Honey, honey,
let your mother speak.

684
00:35:11,654 --> 00:35:13,654
No no no. It... it is
out of the question.

685
00:35:13,689 --> 00:35:16,323
Sweetie, be reasonable.

686
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:18,825
It's a mother's right to get
to do this for her daughter.

687
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,628
You cannot deny me this joy.

688
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:23,663
I'm sorry, we can't
accept your money.

689
00:35:23,698 --> 00:35:26,298
We can't?
We... I think we can.

690
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,033
I... in fact,
I think we should.

691
00:35:28,068 --> 00:35:31,303
How can we deny your mother and father...

692
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:33,771
- That joy?
- Oh.

693
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:39,810
- Fine.
- There's just one catch.

694
00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:42,479
- We spent your wedding fund.
- What?!

695
00:35:42,514 --> 00:35:44,714
We landscaped the backyard.
Doesn't it look great?

696
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,749
Whoa, you spent my wedding fund?

697
00:35:46,784 --> 00:35:49,385
We thought we had more time.

698
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,954
Don't you worry.
We're going to move some money around

699
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:54,656
so we can throw you
the wedding of your dreams.

700
00:35:54,691 --> 00:35:56,458
- It'll be our gift to you.
- Mm-hmm.

701
00:35:56,493 --> 00:35:58,460
Sounds great.

702
00:36:00,396 --> 00:36:02,062
That's great.
All right.

703
00:36:02,097 --> 00:36:04,631
- Take this mousse.
- Get some of that mousse.

704
00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:23,714
- I can't do this.
- Is it too heavy?

705
00:36:23,749 --> 00:36:26,183
No, I'm talking
about my parents.

706
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:28,485
We can't let them
pay for our wedding.

707
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,954
Giving gives them joy.
Why would you want to hurt their feelings?

708
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:34,090
Please, they've been hurting my
feelings for years. It's payback.

709
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,525
I'm sorry, I can't let them
pay for our fake wedding.

710
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,093
Didn't they pay
for Bonnie's wedding?

711
00:36:38,128 --> 00:36:40,162
- Of course.
- Was it nice?

712
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:42,697
It was okay, you know, if
you're into that sort of thing.

713
00:36:42,732 --> 00:36:45,633
Custom Vera wang dresses,
horse-drawn carriages,

714
00:36:45,668 --> 00:36:48,502
a flock of doves released
when they kissed.

715
00:36:48,537 --> 00:36:50,904
My mom still cries
when she talks about it.

716
00:36:50,939 --> 00:36:54,875
See? They just want to share
that same moment with you.

717
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,775
Oh, you're good.

718
00:36:56,811 --> 00:36:59,178
I'm just saying, let them
pay for this wedding.

719
00:36:59,213 --> 00:37:02,914
Then when and if
you meet Mr. Right,

720
00:37:02,949 --> 00:37:05,817
and that's a big if,
you can elope.

721
00:37:05,852 --> 00:37:08,952
Look, we are going
to pay them back.

722
00:37:08,988 --> 00:37:11,455
That's why we're having the wedding.
We have no money.

723
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,891
I have a Monkey on my back
and you have an empty apartment.

724
00:37:13,926 --> 00:37:17,193
Look, we're gonna pay them back if
it takes 10 years, okay? 50-50.

725
00:37:17,228 --> 00:37:18,861
Remember, giving gives you joy.

726
00:37:18,897 --> 00:37:21,097
I didn't sign up for 10 years.

727
00:37:21,132 --> 00:37:23,698
Well, if you don't like the terms,
go find another fake fiancée.

728
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,570
Fine.
We'll pay them back.

729
00:37:28,605 --> 00:37:30,638
Swear on it.

730
00:37:30,673 --> 00:37:32,706
I swear.

731
00:37:36,512 --> 00:37:39,646
Oh my god.

732
00:37:39,681 --> 00:37:42,215
Oh! It's time
for "Sportscenter."

733
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,883
I am so looking forward
to our divorce.

734
00:37:56,729 --> 00:37:59,629
Yeah.

735
00:38:00,933 --> 00:38:02,732
- Hey.
- What are you doing up?

736
00:38:02,768 --> 00:38:05,734
I couldn't sleep, so I made
myself a little snack.

737
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,903
I thought my business
partner might like some.

738
00:38:09,073 --> 00:38:11,240
- Is that tiramisu?
- Yeah.

739
00:38:11,275 --> 00:38:12,941
My mom's an amazing cook.

740
00:38:12,976 --> 00:38:14,842
Taught me everything I know

741
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:19,746
well, good night.

742
00:38:21,617 --> 00:38:23,183
Thanks.

743
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,827
Fox puts it up on the left-hand
side off the backboard...

744
00:38:35,862 --> 00:38:38,196
Yes!

745
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:40,097
Jen, I can't get
over your new place.

746
00:38:40,132 --> 00:38:41,899
I love what you've done with it.

747
00:38:41,934 --> 00:38:43,634
Thanks, Dad.
I was going for

748
00:38:43,669 --> 00:38:45,269
the sweaty locker room feel.

749
00:38:45,304 --> 00:38:47,604
- You nailed it.
- Don't worry.

750
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:49,872
We'll go register
at not just sofas.

751
00:38:49,908 --> 00:38:53,076
- All of this will go.
- So what are you ladies talking about over here?

752
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:55,043
Oh, just making plans.

753
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:57,613
Oh. Wow.

754
00:38:57,648 --> 00:38:59,848
What is that number right there?

755
00:38:59,883 --> 00:39:02,283
Uh, that is the price per head.

756
00:39:02,318 --> 00:39:04,819
Is that the price for,
like, a real human head?

757
00:39:04,854 --> 00:39:08,154
- Because if not, it's way too expensive.
- Weddings aren't cheap.

758
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:11,224
Don't worry, Al and I
have got it covered.

759
00:39:11,259 --> 00:39:14,960
Honey, remember our mantra
"less food, more seats"?

760
00:39:14,996 --> 00:39:18,063
- Listen to that boy. He makes good sense.
- Sweetie?

761
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:19,898
We're throwing a wedding,
not a tailgate party.

762
00:39:19,934 --> 00:39:22,900
- We lucked out, Vince.
- Oh.

763
00:39:22,936 --> 00:39:26,604
The country club had a
cancelation for April 25th.

764
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,105
Can you imagine?

765
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,806
Less than a month
before the wedding.

766
00:39:29,842 --> 00:39:32,009
Poor soul.
Oh, well.

767
00:39:32,044 --> 00:39:35,945
I guess one girl's heartbreak
is another girl's special day.

768
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:39,548
So your first counseling
session with Reverend Jim...

769
00:39:39,584 --> 00:39:41,651
- It's Tuesday night.
- Counseling session?

770
00:39:41,686 --> 00:39:44,319
You just go in and chat
with the reverend

771
00:39:44,354 --> 00:39:47,989
about your relationship and the hopes
and fears you have about marriage.

772
00:39:48,025 --> 00:39:49,957
It's a lot of touchy-feely

773
00:39:49,992 --> 00:39:52,926
mumbo-jumbo
if you ask me.

774
00:39:52,962 --> 00:39:54,962
What are we gonna talk about?

775
00:39:54,997 --> 00:39:57,563
Mom, remember I told you,
Vince is not very religious?

776
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,266
Do you think maybe Reverend
Jim would make an exception?

777
00:40:00,301 --> 00:40:03,669
He will not perform the ceremony unless
you go through counseling first.

778
00:40:03,704 --> 00:40:05,570
Just say, "yes, dear."

779
00:40:05,606 --> 00:40:08,607
It's the two most important
words to a successful marriage.

780
00:40:08,642 --> 00:40:10,574
Yes, dear.

781
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,243
Honey, have you
thought about colors?

782
00:40:12,278 --> 00:40:14,712
'Cause I'm thinking teal.

783
00:40:14,747 --> 00:40:17,313
Huh? It's one of those few colors
that doesn't wash you out.

784
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:21,284
There she is.

785
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:25,320
- Hi, mom.
- Look at you!

786
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:27,289
- Give me a hug!
- How you doing?

787
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,925
Oh, you're just so huggable.

788
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,994
I'm sorry, honey, I would have
been here sooner but I got lost.

789
00:40:33,029 --> 00:40:34,796
I always get lost
in a full moon.

790
00:40:34,831 --> 00:40:36,898
- So introduce me.
- Hi.

791
00:40:36,933 --> 00:40:39,266
Everybody, this is
my mother Catherine.

792
00:40:39,301 --> 00:40:41,601
Mom, these are
Jennifer's parents.

793
00:40:41,637 --> 00:40:44,870
- This is Val.
- Oh, it is so good to meet you.

794
00:40:47,008 --> 00:40:48,774
Oh.

795
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,843
You smell wonderful.

796
00:40:50,878 --> 00:40:53,311
Like saffron.

797
00:40:53,346 --> 00:40:55,180
Thank you.

798
00:40:55,215 --> 00:40:57,348
And that is Al.

799
00:40:57,384 --> 00:40:59,650
Al. Oh.

800
00:41:02,288 --> 00:41:04,988
- So can we call you Mrs. G?
- Actually, I don't...

801
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:08,658
Well, you can call me
whatever moves you.

802
00:41:08,693 --> 00:41:11,828
And you must be Jennifer.

803
00:41:11,863 --> 00:41:14,296
Oh! Oh-oh-oh!

804
00:41:14,331 --> 00:41:17,299
Oh-oh-oh-oh!

805
00:41:17,334 --> 00:41:20,167
I am sure that you
hear this all the time,

806
00:41:20,203 --> 00:41:22,903
but you have
the most beautiful aura.

807
00:41:24,707 --> 00:41:27,640
- Actually, that's a first.
- Well, it's true.

808
00:41:27,676 --> 00:41:31,277
It's purple and orange
and swirls of magenta.

809
00:41:31,313 --> 00:41:34,379
I can tell that you are
a very passionate lover.

810
00:41:34,415 --> 00:41:36,148
Good work, son.

811
00:41:36,183 --> 00:41:38,350
Oh, let me see the
two of you together.

812
00:41:38,385 --> 00:41:39,951
Click.

813
00:41:39,986 --> 00:41:43,054
Now I have
an announcement to make.

814
00:41:43,089 --> 00:41:46,190
I'm sure that Vince has told you
a little bit about our family.

815
00:41:46,226 --> 00:41:49,359
Oh, he did. I hope someday
we get to meet that Tootie.

816
00:41:49,394 --> 00:41:51,261
- Who?
- Mom, you know what?

817
00:41:51,296 --> 00:41:53,096
You and I should
talk about this in private.

818
00:41:53,132 --> 00:41:56,031
It's okay, honey.
These people are family now.

819
00:41:56,067 --> 00:41:58,334
As you know,
Vince's father abandoned us

820
00:41:58,369 --> 00:42:01,369
to pursue his dream
of selfish isolation.

821
00:42:02,873 --> 00:42:04,372
You gotta have goals.

822
00:42:04,407 --> 00:42:06,808
Luckily, my son is an aries

823
00:42:06,843 --> 00:42:09,710
with a saturn rising,
so he persevered.

824
00:42:09,745 --> 00:42:13,147
But a few days ago, out of
the blue his father called.

825
00:42:13,182 --> 00:42:16,983
It seems he's having regrets about
some of the decisions that he made.

826
00:42:17,018 --> 00:42:19,051
And when I told him
about Vince's wedding...

827
00:42:19,087 --> 00:42:21,686
He offered to pay
for half of it.

828
00:42:21,722 --> 00:42:24,022
- Well, that's fantastic.
- No.

829
00:42:24,057 --> 00:42:26,224
- We can't let him pay.
- We can't?

830
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,260
I-I think we can.
I think we should.

831
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:31,095
I mean, how can we deny him that joy?

832
00:42:32,198 --> 00:42:34,098
I'm not letting him pay.

833
00:42:38,403 --> 00:42:40,370
See? Now this is
the perfect thing

834
00:42:40,405 --> 00:42:42,038
to talk about with Reverend Jim.

835
00:42:42,073 --> 00:42:43,906
Who's Tootie?

836
00:42:53,216 --> 00:42:55,049
Okay, well, that wasn't so bad.

837
00:42:55,084 --> 00:42:57,017
Can I just say one more thing?

838
00:42:57,052 --> 00:42:59,386
Sure, express yourself.

839
00:42:59,421 --> 00:43:01,221
He refuses to go see his dad.

840
00:43:01,256 --> 00:43:04,356
I mean, it's clear
he has abandonment issues,

841
00:43:04,392 --> 00:43:06,158
but I just feel that
rather than avoiding them,

842
00:43:06,194 --> 00:43:08,160
he should confront them head on.

843
00:43:08,196 --> 00:43:10,328
It would really help
with his personal growth.

844
00:43:10,363 --> 00:43:13,097
She's the one who's desperately searching
for approval from her parents.

845
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:15,800
So I really wish she would leave
my personal growth out of this.

846
00:43:15,836 --> 00:43:17,868
Now Vince, don't you see
why Jennifer is concerned

847
00:43:17,903 --> 00:43:19,736
with your relationship
with your father?

848
00:43:19,772 --> 00:43:22,172
Yeah, because she wants him
to pay for half the wedding.

849
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:24,140
No no no, I'm sure that
Jennifer is more concerned

850
00:43:24,175 --> 00:43:25,808
with how you'll bring
these feelings

851
00:43:25,844 --> 00:43:28,211
into your role as father
to your own children.

852
00:43:28,246 --> 00:43:31,746
- Isn't that right, Jennifer?
- No, I want his father to pay for half.

853
00:43:31,782 --> 00:43:34,249
Oh, I see.

854
00:43:34,284 --> 00:43:37,952
You with me?

855
00:43:37,987 --> 00:43:40,154
I mean, I'm not the crazy one,
but it doesn't take Dr. Phil

856
00:43:40,189 --> 00:43:43,457
to see that your father is somehow
the root of your gambling problem.

857
00:43:43,492 --> 00:43:46,426
- Gambling problem?
- I do not have a gambling problem.

858
00:43:46,461 --> 00:43:48,394
Oh, come on.

859
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:51,064
I would say owing $15,000 to
a bookie named The Monkey

860
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:52,865
who's gonna have you killed
unless you pay him...

861
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,967
I would say that's a pretty
big problem, wouldn't you?

862
00:43:55,002 --> 00:43:58,237
- Vince, you owe $15,000 to a bookie?
- Named The Monkey.

863
00:43:58,272 --> 00:44:01,138
Whose gonna have him killed if
he doesn't pay, I got that part.

864
00:44:01,174 --> 00:44:03,074
- Is it true?
- No, it is not true.

865
00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:05,376
I do not owe $15,000.

866
00:44:05,411 --> 00:44:07,944
- What?
- It's $20,000.

867
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,512
Oh, didn't see that one
coming now, did you?

868
00:44:09,548 --> 00:44:12,082
No, I didn't.

869
00:44:12,117 --> 00:44:15,818
- You owe another $5,000?
- No, not exactly.

870
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:18,153
Remember what The Monkey was
talking to us about at the zoo?

871
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:20,221
The sweetness clause?

872
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:23,024
It's like a service charge
for those special occasions

873
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:25,360
when The Monkey shows
just how sweet a guy he can be.

874
00:44:25,395 --> 00:44:28,762
Jennifer, tell Vince
how this makes you feel.

875
00:44:28,797 --> 00:44:30,998
I feel...

876
00:44:31,033 --> 00:44:33,966
Like I cannot wait for this to be over
so I never have to see you again.

877
00:44:34,002 --> 00:44:35,902
Don't expect a Christmas card
from me either, sweetie.

878
00:44:35,937 --> 00:44:37,236
I'm not sure you
know how to write.

879
00:44:37,272 --> 00:44:39,138
Okay, I think we're done here.

880
00:44:39,173 --> 00:44:41,806
- Yeah.
- Hold on, hold on. I'm confused.

881
00:44:41,842 --> 00:44:44,542
- Are we calling the wedding off?
- No way.

882
00:44:56,054 --> 00:44:58,254
Oh good, you're home.

883
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:00,056
Ma, those keys were
for emergencies only.

884
00:45:00,091 --> 00:45:03,759
- This is an emergency.
- The wedding is off.

885
00:45:03,794 --> 00:45:07,396
- What?!
- Your father played golf this morning with Reverend Jim.

886
00:45:07,431 --> 00:45:09,397
He told me about your
little gambling problem.

887
00:45:09,432 --> 00:45:12,333
I don't have a gambling problem.

888
00:45:14,971 --> 00:45:16,436
I'm sorry, son.

889
00:45:16,471 --> 00:45:18,471
I'm not letting my daughter
marry an addicted gambler.

890
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,307
Thought that was supposed
to be confidential?

891
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,908
Oh, Reverend Jim
is a terrible gossip.

892
00:45:22,944 --> 00:45:24,476
Thank god we're not catholic.

893
00:45:24,512 --> 00:45:26,211
That man could never
handle confessions.

894
00:45:26,247 --> 00:45:28,814
Vince, we feel for your predicament.

895
00:45:28,849 --> 00:45:31,849
We think you're a good guy.
But we've got to look out for Jennifer here.

896
00:45:31,885 --> 00:45:34,285
She hasn't always made the best
choices when it comes to men.

897
00:45:34,321 --> 00:45:36,019
Excuse me?

898
00:45:36,055 --> 00:45:38,522
Remember Bobby Sherwood?
The gum-in-hair incident?

899
00:45:38,557 --> 00:45:40,557
That was junior high.

900
00:45:40,592 --> 00:45:42,959
We're just saying,
it's a pattern.

901
00:45:42,994 --> 00:45:46,329
I'm sorry, we can't
support this wedding.

902
00:45:47,432 --> 00:45:50,498
- I see.
- Mom, Dad...

903
00:45:50,534 --> 00:45:53,301
I'm ashamed of you.
Marriage isn't only for the good times.

904
00:45:53,337 --> 00:45:55,870
Mom, did you leave Dad when he
had that awful toenail fungus?

905
00:45:55,906 --> 00:45:57,538
No.

906
00:45:57,573 --> 00:46:00,007
Dad, did you leave Mom
when she gave herself

907
00:46:00,042 --> 00:46:03,344
that bad home perm
and was bald for a year?

908
00:46:03,379 --> 00:46:07,146
- No.
- And I'm not leaving Vince in his time of need either.

909
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:09,248
Thanks.

910
00:46:09,284 --> 00:46:11,984
Besides, the catering
deposit is non-refundable.

911
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,886
- It is?
- You won't get a dime back.

912
00:46:14,922 --> 00:46:17,322
- Can they do that?
- Yes.

913
00:46:18,491 --> 00:46:21,125
And on top of all of that,

914
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:24,595
Vince has agreed to go
to Gambler's Anonymous.

915
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:27,130
What?

916
00:46:27,165 --> 00:46:30,533
You can beat this, son!

917
00:46:30,569 --> 00:46:32,634
I am so proud of you.

918
00:46:35,106 --> 00:46:38,873
Hi, I'm Vince and, uh...
And I'm a gambler.

919
00:46:38,908 --> 00:46:40,942
Hi, Vince.

920
00:46:45,581 --> 00:46:47,881
Still me?

921
00:46:49,418 --> 00:46:51,585
Well, um...

922
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,452
What can I say?

923
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:00,191
You gotta know when to hold 'em.

924
00:47:00,227 --> 00:47:03,995
- Hmm.
- Know when to fold 'em.

925
00:47:07,933 --> 00:47:09,433
Thank you.

926
00:47:09,468 --> 00:47:11,068
Thanks for sharing.

927
00:47:14,172 --> 00:47:15,872
That felt good.

928
00:47:15,907 --> 00:47:17,840
- Crazy, huh?
- Yeah.

929
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,442
You've known this guy
what, a month?

930
00:47:19,477 --> 00:47:21,443
You sure you're not preggo?

931
00:47:21,478 --> 00:47:23,445
I mean, we are
at David's bridal,

932
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,447
I'm sure we could find something
with an empire waist.

933
00:47:25,482 --> 00:47:27,181
No, I'm not preggo.

934
00:47:27,216 --> 00:47:28,949
So when am I gonna
get to meet this Vince?

935
00:47:28,985 --> 00:47:30,951
Wait a minute.
Why haven't I met Vince?

936
00:47:30,987 --> 00:47:32,553
Has the family met him?

937
00:47:32,588 --> 00:47:34,254
Everyone but Bonnie.

938
00:47:34,289 --> 00:47:36,489
Courtney, what do you
think of this one?

939
00:47:36,525 --> 00:47:38,625
- Sorry, what?
- What do you think?

940
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,393
This one's my favorite.

941
00:47:44,165 --> 00:47:46,231
Hi, my name is Ben
and I'm a gambling addict.

942
00:47:46,267 --> 00:47:48,599
- Hi, Ben.
- What's up?

943
00:47:48,635 --> 00:47:50,568
Horses were my thing.

944
00:47:50,603 --> 00:47:53,171
I spent more time at the track
than I did with my family.

945
00:47:53,206 --> 00:47:56,106
- I hear you.
- And at my lowest point,

946
00:47:56,141 --> 00:47:59,142
I was over $300,000 in debt.

947
00:47:59,178 --> 00:48:01,278
Thanks to these meetings,

948
00:48:01,313 --> 00:48:03,412
I've been able to control my addictions.

949
00:48:03,448 --> 00:48:05,181
And I haven't placed
a bet in over five years.

950
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:08,551
Way to go.

951
00:48:10,353 --> 00:48:14,122
In fact, I just took my company public.

952
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:17,257
Who would've ever thought that
I would be a multimillionaire?

953
00:48:17,293 --> 00:48:20,160
I mean... thanks.

954
00:48:23,565 --> 00:48:26,566
Ben shows us what is possible
if you work the program.

955
00:48:26,601 --> 00:48:29,535
I had a feeling you two would hit it off.

956
00:48:29,571 --> 00:48:31,236
Really? Why?

957
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:33,004
'Cause I know you.

958
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,940
And I know how important
loyalty is to you

959
00:48:34,975 --> 00:48:38,008
and Steve told me that
out of all of his friends

960
00:48:38,044 --> 00:48:40,377
Vince is the one guy that
he could always count on

961
00:48:40,413 --> 00:48:42,213
24/7.

962
00:48:42,248 --> 00:48:44,214
How is he with his mother?
I mean, that says a lot

963
00:48:44,249 --> 00:48:46,116
about how he'll be with you.

964
00:48:46,151 --> 00:48:47,684
Well, he's wonderful with her.

965
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:49,486
And you say that he gets
along with your parents?

966
00:48:49,521 --> 00:48:51,587
Strangely, yes.

967
00:48:51,622 --> 00:48:54,523
- Well, then he must really love you.
- Forget the parents.

968
00:48:54,558 --> 00:48:56,625
How is he at
the horizontal hokey-pokey?

969
00:48:56,660 --> 00:49:00,194
- You guys!
- Yeah, David. So rude.

970
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:02,163
But can we talk about his body?

971
00:49:02,198 --> 00:49:04,431
Seriously, he has ab muscles
I didn't know existed.

972
00:49:04,466 --> 00:49:08,001
Oh my god, you're blushing.

973
00:49:08,036 --> 00:49:10,370
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

974
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:13,205
I'm not sure I've ever
even seen you blush before.

975
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,773
Awww.

976
00:49:18,712 --> 00:49:21,112
Ben, hey.
Vince.

977
00:49:21,148 --> 00:49:22,514
Hi. I spoke
a little earlier.

978
00:49:22,549 --> 00:49:24,349
I remember.

979
00:49:24,384 --> 00:49:26,450
Yeah, um, listen,

980
00:49:26,485 --> 00:49:29,586
your story saved
my life tonight.

981
00:49:29,622 --> 00:49:32,955
- And I was just wondering...
- If I'd be your sponsor? Sure.

982
00:49:32,991 --> 00:49:34,690
Absolutely.

983
00:49:34,726 --> 00:49:37,293
Actually, if you'd
come to my wedding.

984
00:49:37,328 --> 00:49:40,362
- But we just met.
- I know. I know.

985
00:49:40,397 --> 00:49:42,330
It's just that you've
been such a wealth...

986
00:49:43,667 --> 00:49:45,367
Of inspiration to me, Ben.

987
00:49:45,402 --> 00:49:47,201
If you could just write down
your name and address,

988
00:49:47,236 --> 00:49:49,236
I would love to send you
an invitation.

989
00:49:49,272 --> 00:49:52,439
- Sure.
- Paper.

990
00:49:52,475 --> 00:49:55,808
- Pen.
- Appreciate it.

991
00:49:58,313 --> 00:49:59,679
- That's great. Thank you.
- Here you go.

992
00:49:59,714 --> 00:50:01,380
- Thanks.
- Thank you. See you soon.

993
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,081
- You got it.
- Okay.

994
00:50:03,117 --> 00:50:05,517
I'm sorry, I couldn't help
but overhearing.

995
00:50:05,553 --> 00:50:08,386
- You're not really getting married are you?
- Why do you ask?

996
00:50:08,421 --> 00:50:10,755
It's just that you don't seem like
the marrying type, that's all.

997
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:13,357
Why do people keep saying that?

998
00:50:13,393 --> 00:50:17,594
Well, I guess I am the type because
yes, I am getting married.

999
00:50:17,629 --> 00:50:19,129
Too bad.

1000
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:26,135
But not for several weeks.

1001
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:28,069
I know we're not supposed
to gamble anymore.

1002
00:50:28,104 --> 00:50:30,238
That's my understanding too.

1003
00:50:30,273 --> 00:50:32,674
But that doesn't rule out
all risky behavior, does it?

1004
00:50:32,709 --> 00:50:36,376
- What did you have in mind?
- Buy a girl a drink?

1005
00:50:40,616 --> 00:50:42,582
Maybe just one.

00:51:23,452 --> 00:51:25,452

So she's a real spitfire,
I'll tell you that.

1027
00:51:33,327 --> 00:51:36,028
She does not make it easy.

1028
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:39,030
Well, relationships never are.

1029
00:51:39,065 --> 00:51:41,165
There is something kinda cool
about her though, you know?

1030
00:51:41,201 --> 00:51:43,201
Something that just
sort of, I don't know,

1031
00:51:43,236 --> 00:51:46,036
sneaks up on you.

1032
00:51:46,071 --> 00:51:48,071
That's great.

1033
00:51:48,107 --> 00:51:49,706
Well, this is my stop.

1034
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:53,542
Be careful getting off.

1035
00:51:53,578 --> 00:51:55,645
That will be up to you.

1036
00:52:13,828 --> 00:52:15,495
Well, Mr. Gambling Man

1037
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:17,430
of the marrying type,

1038
00:52:17,465 --> 00:52:20,098
just how much risk
are you willing to take?

1039
00:53:01,536 --> 00:53:04,670
- Hey.
- Hey there, Bridezilla.

1040
00:53:04,706 --> 00:53:06,238
What are you doing?

1041
00:53:06,274 --> 00:53:08,873
I made us a lasagna
so that we could celebrate.

1042
00:53:08,909 --> 00:53:11,242
- Celebrate?
- Yeah.

1043
00:53:11,278 --> 00:53:13,411
We got our first official
wedding gifts today.

1044
00:53:13,447 --> 00:53:15,746
You are now the proud owner
of a cupcake carrier

1045
00:53:15,781 --> 00:53:18,415
and I got a check for 100 bucks.

1046
00:53:18,451 --> 00:53:20,551
Awesome.

1047
00:53:20,586 --> 00:53:23,419
- Oh, hey, sorry about last night.
- Last night?

1048
00:53:23,455 --> 00:53:25,855
Yeah, I should have called you,

1049
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:28,590
- let you know I wasn't gonna come home.
- Oh, did you not come back?

1050
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:30,826
- I didn't notice.
- Oh.

1051
00:53:30,861 --> 00:53:32,661
Okay, well, good.

1052
00:53:32,696 --> 00:53:35,297
I mean, we're just fake
fiancés, Vince, remember?

1053
00:53:35,331 --> 00:53:37,765
It's not like we're
really in love.

1054
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,534
I got it.

1055
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:43,269
You know, at some point, we're
gonna have to talk about our vows.

1056
00:53:43,305 --> 00:53:45,238
Don't we just repeat
what the Reverend says?

1057
00:53:45,273 --> 00:53:47,006
Church vows are so cold
and impersonal.

1058
00:53:47,042 --> 00:53:49,341
Yeah, I'd hate for our fake vows

1059
00:53:49,377 --> 00:53:51,310
at our fake wedding
to not be from the heart.

1060
00:53:51,345 --> 00:53:53,846
Look, all of my family and
friends are going to be there.

1061
00:53:53,881 --> 00:53:56,681
If the vows are fake, I'd still
like for them to be impressive.

1062
00:53:56,716 --> 00:53:58,349
Can't you just read a poem or something?

1063
00:53:58,385 --> 00:54:00,818
Okay, you know what?
Never mind.

1064
00:54:00,854 --> 00:54:03,320
I'll write your vows for you, okay?
You don't have to worry about it.

1065
00:54:03,355 --> 00:54:05,689
- What about your vows?
- What do you mean?

1066
00:54:05,724 --> 00:54:07,791
Well, you get to write exactly
what you want me to say.

1067
00:54:07,826 --> 00:54:09,526
What about what
you're gonna say to me?

1068
00:54:09,561 --> 00:54:11,827
I thought I'd just read
a poem or something.

1069
00:54:11,863 --> 00:54:14,330
What? No, I don't think so.
I'm gonna write your vows.

1070
00:54:14,365 --> 00:54:15,998
- Fine.
- Can I get a piece of paper?

1071
00:54:17,934 --> 00:54:19,701
Got an extra pen?

1072
00:54:19,736 --> 00:54:21,503
What is that?

1073
00:54:22,706 --> 00:54:24,471
It's a pen.

1074
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:27,541
Okay.

1075
00:54:36,584 --> 00:54:38,283
What do you have so far?

1076
00:54:40,354 --> 00:54:43,355
"Jennifer, I didn't know
how loving a person could be

1077
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:45,756
until I met you."

1078
00:54:45,792 --> 00:54:48,359
- What?
- I'm gonna sound like such a loser.

1079
00:54:48,394 --> 00:54:51,861
- You are a loser.
- I don't think I can read that with a straight face.

1080
00:54:51,897 --> 00:54:53,930
I don't even know if you
can read, period.

1081
00:54:53,965 --> 00:54:56,266
You know what?

1082
00:54:56,301 --> 00:54:57,867
Enjoy the lasagna.
I just lost my appetite.

1083
00:54:57,903 --> 00:55:00,569
Well, maybe you left it
where you were last night.

1084
00:55:00,604 --> 00:55:02,905
So now I'm supposed to check
in with my fake fiancé?

1085
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,506
No, because that
would be considerate,

1086
00:55:04,542 --> 00:55:06,774
something you
know nothing about.

1087
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:08,810
For your information, I walked
someone home last night

1088
00:55:08,845 --> 00:55:10,778
and then I slept at my mom's.

1089
00:55:10,814 --> 00:55:13,780
Why?
I have no idea.

1090
00:55:15,617 --> 00:55:19,352
Hello. Oh my god.
Okay, I'll be right there.

1091
00:55:20,354 --> 00:55:21,887
What happened?

1092
00:55:21,923 --> 00:55:24,890
My sister's in the hospital.
She had a car accident.

1093
00:55:27,494 --> 00:55:28,993
Jennifer!

1094
00:55:29,029 --> 00:55:31,463
Hey, guys.

1095
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:34,898
Hey. Where are grandma and grandpa?

1096
00:55:34,934 --> 00:55:37,835
- Inside with mom and dad.
- They won't let us see mommy.

1097
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:40,436
They didn't want Samantha to get scared.
I have to stay with her.

1098
00:55:40,472 --> 00:55:42,738
You guys gonna be okay out here
by yourselves for a little while?

1099
00:55:42,774 --> 00:55:44,474
Yep, I'm in charge.

1100
00:55:44,509 --> 00:55:46,742
Okay, I'll be right back, okay?

1101
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,646
- Who's he?
- Some guy.

1102
00:55:59,822 --> 00:56:01,721
Bonnie?

1103
00:56:01,756 --> 00:56:04,691
I'm sorry, Bonnie.
I'm so sorry.

1104
00:56:04,726 --> 00:56:08,094
Look, I know our
relationship has been rocky.

1105
00:56:10,898 --> 00:56:12,931
What can I say?

1106
00:56:14,502 --> 00:56:17,568
Here's what I can say.

1107
00:56:17,604 --> 00:56:21,506
You're my little sister, so I didn't
expect you to get married first.

1108
00:56:23,108 --> 00:56:24,774
But you did

1109
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:27,744
and I had to deal with that.

1110
00:56:27,779 --> 00:56:29,712
And then Jonathan
and Samantha came along

1111
00:56:29,747 --> 00:56:31,747
and you guys were like

1112
00:56:31,782 --> 00:56:34,517
the picture-perfect family.

1113
00:56:34,552 --> 00:56:36,718
And mom and dad wanted to spend
all their time with you guys

1114
00:56:36,753 --> 00:56:39,821
and I just...
I felt like an outsider.

1115
00:56:41,992 --> 00:56:44,057
And I admit I was jealous.

1116
00:56:44,093 --> 00:56:45,993
I'm still jealous.

1117
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:49,062
But if you could
just pull through...

1118
00:56:50,665 --> 00:56:52,999
I promise I'll put
all that behind me.

1119
00:56:55,403 --> 00:56:57,769
In fact,

1120
00:56:57,804 --> 00:57:01,439
I was thinking you'd make a
pretty good maid of honor.

1121
00:57:01,475 --> 00:57:03,508
All you had to do was ask.

1122
00:57:11,016 --> 00:57:12,815
Feel better.

1123
00:57:12,851 --> 00:57:15,118
Mom said you were
hit by a truck.

1124
00:57:15,153 --> 00:57:19,054
- Mom!
- Those weren't the exact words I used.

1125
00:57:19,089 --> 00:57:21,056
No, I was getting
some of the kids' stuff

1126
00:57:21,091 --> 00:57:23,792
out of the attic
to give to Goodwill

1127
00:57:23,827 --> 00:57:26,961
and I accidentally
stepped on a toy truck

1128
00:57:26,996 --> 00:57:29,397
- near the stairs.
- Thank god you're okay.

1129
00:57:30,967 --> 00:57:33,800
So I guess
you heard all that, huh?

1130
00:57:33,835 --> 00:57:35,735
Yeah.

1131
00:57:38,006 --> 00:57:40,773
I love you.

1132
00:57:40,808 --> 00:57:42,975
- I love you too.
- Come here.

1133
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:44,843
Give me a hug.

1134
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,447
I hope you guys aren't
the type of kids

1135
00:57:49,482 --> 00:57:51,149
who are used to adults
letting you win all the time.

1136
00:57:51,184 --> 00:57:53,150
It's not gonna be that
way tonight. Oh no.

1137
00:57:53,185 --> 00:57:55,419
No, tonight this game is on.

1138
00:57:55,454 --> 00:57:56,920
It's on like a night light.

1139
00:57:56,956 --> 00:57:58,822
Let's go.

1140
00:57:58,857 --> 00:58:02,058
He missed it!

1141
00:58:02,093 --> 00:58:04,927
Oh my god, he missed it.

1142
00:58:10,634 --> 00:58:13,034
Whoo-hoo!
Goal!

1143
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:15,669
He gets rid of this guy.
He picks the little girl up.

1144
00:58:15,705 --> 00:58:17,504
Oh, the crowd is going wild!

1145
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,039
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo!

1146
00:58:19,075 --> 00:58:20,773
He grabs the flag.

1147
00:58:20,809 --> 00:58:22,475
He's parading around the arena.

1148
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:24,711
Whoo-hoo!
Oh!

1149
00:58:24,746 --> 00:58:28,614
That was a cheap shot.
You think you got him down.

1150
00:58:28,649 --> 00:58:31,583
He's getting back up.

1151
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:33,852
He's angry!
He's angry!

1152
00:58:33,887 --> 00:58:37,688
He's turning into a monster!

1153
00:58:37,724 --> 00:58:39,757
Okay! Now visiting
hours are over.

1154
00:58:39,792 --> 00:58:41,658
Your dad's gonna
stay here tonight

1155
00:58:41,693 --> 00:58:43,660
so you kids get
to come home with us.

1156
00:58:43,695 --> 00:58:46,062
- Yeah, come on.
- Unless you guys want to come back

1157
00:58:46,098 --> 00:58:48,063
- to our place with us tonight.
- Yeah!

1158
00:58:48,099 --> 00:58:49,898
That's what I thought.

1159
00:58:52,169 --> 00:58:53,736
Okay! Good job.

1160
00:58:53,771 --> 00:58:55,470
Good game.

1161
00:59:21,094 --> 00:59:22,693
So, uh...

1162
00:59:22,728 --> 00:59:26,497
Guess I'll just
sleep in here tonight?

1163
00:59:26,532 --> 00:59:28,632
Hey, Vince, how's your stamina?

1164
00:59:29,734 --> 00:59:31,501
Never had any complaints.

1165
00:59:31,536 --> 00:59:33,870
And how's your lung capacity?

1166
00:59:34,973 --> 00:59:36,905
Fantastic.

1167
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:40,075
Great. Then you'll have no
problem blowing up your bed.

1168
00:59:42,513 --> 00:59:44,045
Good night.

1169
01:00:03,064 --> 01:00:05,630
- What's up, boss?
- What do you got for me?

1170
01:00:05,665 --> 01:00:07,799
From the pizza man.

1171
01:00:09,169 --> 01:00:11,102
Bam!

1172
01:00:13,872 --> 01:00:15,572
Not bad.

1173
01:00:17,876 --> 01:00:20,276
What is this?

1174
01:00:20,311 --> 01:00:23,612
- He only came up with half the cash...
- So we took half his finger.

1175
01:00:25,248 --> 01:00:28,817
- What else?
- We paid Vince a visit like you asked.

1176
01:00:28,852 --> 01:00:30,785
And?

1177
01:00:33,923 --> 01:00:37,257
They went with the hydrangeas
for the centerpieces.

1178
01:00:37,293 --> 01:00:38,992
And Wisteria for the bouquet.

1179
01:00:39,028 --> 01:00:41,127
Nosegay or cascade?

1180
01:00:41,162 --> 01:00:43,696
- I forgot to ask.
- Damn.

1181
01:00:44,966 --> 01:00:46,832
Well, go and find out.

1182
01:00:46,867 --> 01:00:49,835
Pay attention to detail, truck!

1183
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:52,204
"Pay attention to detail, truck."

1184
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,908
Go on. Got you. I got you.

1185
01:00:57,944 --> 01:01:00,777
For a little kid, you're pretty good at this thing.

1186
01:01:00,812 --> 01:01:04,180
- I know.
- Hey, no more video games. It's time for bed.

1187
01:01:04,216 --> 01:01:06,049
Oh, come on.
Just one more game, Aunt Jen?

1188
01:01:06,084 --> 01:01:08,283
Yeah, I'm really behind here.

1189
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:10,786
I said yes one game ago.
Now get in that bed...

1190
01:01:10,821 --> 01:01:13,255
Well, chair, little man.

1191
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:15,323
All right, let's do it.

1192
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:17,692
Get in there.

1193
01:01:17,727 --> 01:01:19,994
All right.
Night, buddy.

1194
01:01:21,797 --> 01:01:23,697
Aren't you gonna tuck me in?

1195
01:01:23,732 --> 01:01:27,334
You... yeah, sure.
Why not?

1196
01:01:27,369 --> 01:01:29,668
Um, but be warned,

1197
01:01:29,704 --> 01:01:31,804
this will be my first official tuck in.

1198
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:36,341
There you go.
Night night.

1199
01:01:37,878 --> 01:01:40,311
- Uncle Vince?
- Yeah?

1200
01:01:40,347 --> 01:01:42,579
Are we going home soon?

1201
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:44,581
Oh, you didn't hear?

1202
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:46,316
Your mother called earlier

1203
01:01:46,352 --> 01:01:48,785
and she said that you guys
get to stay with us forever!

1204
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:50,586
No! I wanna go home!

1205
01:01:50,622 --> 01:01:52,355
Hey, calm down.
Inside voice.

1206
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:55,124
- Whoa, what happened?
- Uh...

1207
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,192
- I think I broke him.
- Jonathan?

1208
01:01:57,227 --> 01:01:59,261
Tell Aunt Jen what's wrong.

1209
01:01:59,296 --> 01:02:03,097
Uncle Vince said mommy
left us here forever.

1210
01:02:03,132 --> 01:02:06,634
- It was a joke.
- Uncle Vince was trying to be funny.

1211
01:02:06,669 --> 01:02:08,903
- But he's not funny.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

1212
01:02:08,938 --> 01:02:12,172
Hey, you have any favorite nighttime stories?

1213
01:02:12,207 --> 01:02:14,841
Mmm, "Peter Pan."

1214
01:02:14,876 --> 01:02:16,809
Oh, really?

1215
01:02:16,844 --> 01:02:19,344
I don't think I know that one.
Can you tell it to me?

1216
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:23,015
Okay, well, it's about
this kid named Peter Pan.

1217
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:24,882
Oh, I like it already.

1218
01:02:24,918 --> 01:02:26,951
And also there's this girl Wendy

1219
01:02:26,986 --> 01:02:28,686
and this fairy tinkerbell

1220
01:02:28,721 --> 01:02:31,721
and this pirate that has
a hook instead of a hand.

1221
01:02:31,757 --> 01:02:33,957
Oh, really?
What else?

1222
01:02:33,992 --> 01:02:35,992
Well, Peter Pan takes Wendy and her brothers

1223
01:02:36,028 --> 01:02:39,795
off to Neverland and
they go on an adventure.

1224
01:02:39,831 --> 01:02:42,765
- Was there lost boys there?
- Yeah.

1225
01:02:49,806 --> 01:02:52,973
I'm sorry you've had to sleep on
that air mattress this whole time.

1226
01:02:53,008 --> 01:02:54,675
It's all right.
It's fine.

1227
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:56,210
Well, you haven't
complained once.

1228
01:02:56,245 --> 01:02:58,311
It's like you're a real adult.

1229
01:02:58,346 --> 01:03:00,446
That's the worst thing
anyone has ever told me.

1230
01:03:05,986 --> 01:03:08,320
Good night, Vince.

1231
01:03:08,355 --> 01:03:10,188
Good night, Jennifer.

1232
01:03:17,997 --> 01:03:20,029
I think you've sprung a leak.

1233
01:03:20,065 --> 01:03:21,865
It's a slow leak.
It'll be fine.

1234
01:03:27,071 --> 01:03:29,104
I guess you could sleep up here.

1235
01:03:31,275 --> 01:03:33,641
Wouldn't that be weird?

1236
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:36,077
Just stay on top of the covers.

1237
01:03:50,825 --> 01:03:52,658
Night.

1238
01:04:26,756 --> 01:04:28,388
Wait.
What are we doing?

1239
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:31,824
Have you never done this before?

1240
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:33,927
Shut up.

1241
01:04:36,864 --> 01:04:38,397
Who is it?

1242
01:04:38,432 --> 01:04:40,165
Wait.

1243
01:04:41,835 --> 01:04:43,301
I don't feel so good.

1244
01:04:43,336 --> 01:04:45,336
What's the matter, sweetie?

1245
01:04:45,371 --> 01:04:49,239
I have a tummy...

1246
01:04:54,313 --> 01:04:56,111
You feel better now?

1247
01:04:56,147 --> 01:04:58,447
Come on. Uncle Vince'll
clean you up, all right?

1248
01:04:58,482 --> 01:05:00,282
I want Aunt Jennifer to do it.

1249
01:05:00,318 --> 01:05:02,818
You do?

1250
01:05:02,853 --> 01:05:05,053
Oh, come here.
Let Aunt Jen take care of you.

1251
01:05:12,528 --> 01:05:14,761
I knew I should
have worn my slippers.

1252
01:05:54,530 --> 01:05:57,598
Uncle Vince.
Uncle Vince.

1253
01:06:01,003 --> 01:06:03,103
- Yeah, buddy?
- Where's Samantha?

1254
01:06:03,138 --> 01:06:05,238
Uh, she's sleeping
with your Aunt Jennifer.

1255
01:06:05,273 --> 01:06:06,939
Oh.

1256
01:06:06,974 --> 01:06:10,142
She's not feeling too good.

1257
01:06:10,177 --> 01:06:12,977
It's been a...

1258
01:06:13,013 --> 01:06:15,813
Very interesting night,
little man.

1259
01:06:15,849 --> 01:06:17,348
What happened?

1260
01:06:19,452 --> 01:06:22,352
One day I will tell you
all about it, all right?

1261
01:06:22,388 --> 01:06:24,788
- Maybe when you're in college.
- I'm not going to college.

1262
01:06:24,823 --> 01:06:27,356
- Neither is Samantha.
- Why not?

1263
01:06:27,392 --> 01:06:29,458
I heard grandpa say they're
gonna use our college fund

1264
01:06:29,494 --> 01:06:32,528
to pay for your wedding.

1265
01:06:32,563 --> 01:06:34,796
They said that?

1266
01:06:34,831 --> 01:06:37,098
Good night.

1267
01:06:43,906 --> 01:06:45,806
We won.

1268
01:06:54,049 --> 01:06:56,581
- How much we got?
- I'm gonna win big time.

1269
01:06:56,617 --> 01:06:59,284
Dad.

1270
01:06:59,319 --> 01:07:01,886
Hey.

1271
01:07:01,921 --> 01:07:04,121
Vince?

1272
01:07:04,157 --> 01:07:05,856
How the hell'd you know
where to find me?

1273
01:07:05,892 --> 01:07:07,992
It's where mom always came
when she needed to find you,

1274
01:07:08,027 --> 01:07:09,526
usually with me in tow.

1275
01:07:09,561 --> 01:07:11,361
And you remember that?

1276
01:07:11,396 --> 01:07:14,397
Not much else to remember, Dad.

1277
01:07:14,433 --> 01:07:17,566
Well, it's good to see you too.

1278
01:07:19,637 --> 01:07:21,970
- Can I buy you a beer or...
- No. No.

1279
01:07:22,005 --> 01:07:24,572
- I really just came here to take care of business.
- Come on.

1280
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:27,241
Stick around a while,
place a couple of bets.

1281
01:07:27,277 --> 01:07:29,342
I've given it up.
It's a nasty habit.

1282
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:32,946
I'm gonna be breaking
the cycle, I think.

1283
01:07:32,981 --> 01:07:35,048
So you're just here
for the money?

1284
01:07:37,185 --> 01:07:39,151
I don't know what I'm here for.
Maybe this was a mistake.

1285
01:07:39,187 --> 01:07:41,353
No, Vince, look.

1286
01:07:41,389 --> 01:07:43,488
I know that life
was tough for you

1287
01:07:43,523 --> 01:07:45,890
and I'm sorry about that.

1288
01:07:45,926 --> 01:07:49,461
I realize I'm never
gonna be father of the year.

1289
01:07:49,496 --> 01:07:51,228
I would have settled
for just a father.

1290
01:07:54,867 --> 01:07:57,100
I hit it pretty big
at the track last year.

1291
01:07:57,135 --> 01:08:00,570
It's the big payoff I've
always been waiting for.

1292
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,406
But after the excitement
wore off, I realized...

1293
01:08:05,976 --> 01:08:07,943
I don't have anybody
to celebrate with.

1294
01:08:07,978 --> 01:08:10,245
I guess that's what happens when
this replaces your home, Dad.

1295
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:13,180
I'm... I'm trying
to make amends, son.

1296
01:08:13,216 --> 01:08:16,317
I'd like a second chance.
I know that I don't deserve one.

1297
01:08:16,352 --> 01:08:18,017
You don't.

1298
01:08:18,053 --> 01:08:21,121
All right.
All right.

1299
01:08:23,225 --> 01:08:25,891
I'm proud of you, Vince.

1300
01:08:25,926 --> 01:08:29,628
Falling in love,
getting married,

1301
01:08:29,663 --> 01:08:32,130
creating a family, it's...

1302
01:08:32,165 --> 01:08:33,931
Hell, I envy you.

1303
01:08:36,102 --> 01:08:38,002
I gambled away
the love of my life...

1304
01:08:40,973 --> 01:08:42,506
And my relationship with you.

1305
01:08:47,445 --> 01:08:49,645
That is my biggest regret.

1306
01:08:55,886 --> 01:08:58,353
- I'm gonna find another way to get the money.
- Vince, come on.

1307
01:08:58,388 --> 01:09:00,954
Please. Please.

1308
01:09:02,458 --> 01:09:05,459
Let me do this much.
All right?

1309
01:09:13,534 --> 01:09:16,301
The wedding's next Saturday, 2:00 P.M.
at peachtree Christian.

1310
01:09:29,614 --> 01:09:32,448
Say goodbye to your Aunt Jen and
don't forget to say thank you.

1311
01:09:32,484 --> 01:09:34,516
Where's Uncle Vince?

1312
01:09:34,552 --> 01:09:36,685
Hey! Where do you
think I am, buddy?

1313
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,954
Hey! Ah!
What the heck, man?

1314
01:09:38,989 --> 01:09:40,522
You gonna leave
without saying goodbye?

1315
01:09:40,558 --> 01:09:42,356
After all we've
been through? Come on.

1316
01:09:44,961 --> 01:09:46,727
From my father.

1317
01:09:52,334 --> 01:09:54,000
Are you okay?

1318
01:09:54,036 --> 01:09:55,534
I will be.

1319
01:09:58,172 --> 01:10:01,240
Sorry, kid. Looks like you're gonna
be going to college after all.

1320
01:10:01,275 --> 01:10:03,408
- Come on, let's go.
- I'm gonna miss him.

1321
01:10:03,443 --> 01:10:05,310
Don't worry,
he's not going anywhere.

1322
01:10:10,349 --> 01:10:12,149
You know, the kids have
only been gone a few hours

1323
01:10:12,184 --> 01:10:14,051
- and I miss them already.
- I know.

1324
01:10:14,086 --> 01:10:16,385
This thing's still got a leak in it.

1325
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:19,355
Listen, about what
happened last night...

1326
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:23,124
Or didn't happen last night.

1327
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,627
It's probably for the best.

1328
01:10:28,065 --> 01:10:31,298
- Yeah.
- I mean, things could get complicated.

1329
01:10:33,202 --> 01:10:35,002
I'm a simple guy.

1330
01:10:38,073 --> 01:10:40,073
That was a softball.
No comeback there?

1331
01:10:42,577 --> 01:10:45,077
Good night, Vince.

1332
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:51,515
Well, I don't think I'm gonna risk

1333
01:10:51,551 --> 01:10:53,284
the air mattress again tonight.

1334
01:10:53,319 --> 01:10:55,586
So I'll probably just...

1335
01:10:58,257 --> 01:11:00,090
Night.

1336
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:03,260
See you at the rehearsal dinner.

1337
01:11:16,706 --> 01:11:18,972
Um, my parents and I

1338
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:21,208
couldn't be happier

1339
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:22,776
that we have
all of you here to celebrate

1340
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:24,678
Vince and Jennifer's
wedding tomorrow.

1341
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:27,046
I think it's probably
safe to say many of us

1342
01:11:27,081 --> 01:11:29,315
never thought that Jennifer
would ever get married.

1343
01:11:32,252 --> 01:11:35,320
But she has found
this wonderful man

1344
01:11:35,355 --> 01:11:38,390
who's so funny,

1345
01:11:38,425 --> 01:11:41,292
giving and warm.

1346
01:11:41,327 --> 01:11:44,962
And he obviously adores her.

1347
01:11:44,997 --> 01:11:47,330
I've seen the way
Vince looks at Jennifer

1348
01:11:47,365 --> 01:11:50,033
when she's not looking.

1349
01:11:50,068 --> 01:11:51,801
And I-I can see
what he must see.

1350
01:11:55,639 --> 01:11:59,341
I look forward to tomorrow

1351
01:11:59,376 --> 01:12:01,208
to seeing my beautiful
sister as happy

1352
01:12:01,244 --> 01:12:03,811
as I was on my wedding day.

1353
01:12:05,748 --> 01:12:08,048
But more importantly,
I look forward

1354
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:11,117
to being a part of the life

1355
01:12:11,153 --> 01:12:13,019
that Jennifer
and Vince make together.

1356
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:17,222
To Vince and Jennifer.

1357
01:12:17,258 --> 01:12:19,391
May you live happily ever...

1358
01:12:19,427 --> 01:12:21,292
Jen-Jen?

1359
01:12:25,699 --> 01:12:28,598
Nerves.

1360
01:12:40,345 --> 01:12:41,843
Hey.

1361
01:12:41,878 --> 01:12:43,545
I can't go through with it.

1362
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:47,449
I can't deceive
all my family and friends.

1363
01:12:47,484 --> 01:12:49,450
I'm sorry,
I-I just can't.

1364
01:12:51,854 --> 01:12:53,520
We have to.

1365
01:12:53,556 --> 01:12:55,422
I'm calling it off.

1366
01:12:57,325 --> 01:13:00,126
No, you're not.
Here.

1367
01:13:00,161 --> 01:13:01,794
How can you go
through with this?

1368
01:13:04,732 --> 01:13:07,466
You can't do this
to me, Jennifer.

1369
01:13:07,501 --> 01:13:10,101
I could have taken that money my
father gave me and paid off my debt,

1370
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:12,603
- but I didn't do it.
- Why didn't you?

1371
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:16,073
I don't know, because...

1372
01:13:16,109 --> 01:13:17,674
Because I just didn't.

1373
01:13:20,645 --> 01:13:23,213
Look, I can't... I can't
stand up there tomorrow

1374
01:13:23,247 --> 01:13:25,714
and marry a man
who doesn't love me.

1375
01:13:30,154 --> 01:13:35,223
Now you tell me. That's great timing.

1376
01:13:35,258 --> 01:13:37,724
Sorry, you'll just have to pay
back your debt some other way.

1377
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,160
If I could've thought of any
other way to get that money,

1378
01:13:40,195 --> 01:13:41,561
you think I would've
gone through all this?

1379
01:13:41,597 --> 01:13:44,463
Sorry it's been so terrible.

1380
01:13:46,534 --> 01:13:48,701
Why don't you go back
in there, Jennifer?

1381
01:13:48,736 --> 01:13:52,637
All right? Tell your parents that
all that money they just spent

1382
01:13:52,672 --> 01:13:54,539
was for nothing.

1383
01:13:56,476 --> 01:13:58,308
Can you do that?

1384
01:13:59,678 --> 01:14:02,579
That's what I thought.

1385
01:14:02,615 --> 01:14:05,648
The wedding is on.

1386
01:14:05,683 --> 01:14:08,418
Unless you want The Monkey to kill
me so you can keep my television.

1387
01:14:10,855 --> 01:14:13,155
After the wedding, I never
want to see you again.

1388
01:14:13,190 --> 01:14:15,624
- Thank god I didn't sleep with you.
- You would've loved it.

1389
01:14:15,659 --> 01:14:17,426
- Yeah, not as much as you would have.
- Mm-hmm.

1390
01:14:27,803 --> 01:14:30,236
How do you tie
these things, Steve?

1391
01:14:30,272 --> 01:14:32,238
Why didn't you just
get the clip-on?

1392
01:14:32,274 --> 01:14:34,573
I don't know, 'cause maybe
I'm getting married, man.

1393
01:14:34,608 --> 01:14:36,442
- Are you decent?
- Yeah.

1394
01:14:36,477 --> 01:14:39,311
Wow, you look...
Dashing.

1395
01:14:39,346 --> 01:14:41,779
Thanks. Is she okay? She's still
gonna go through with this, right?

1396
01:14:41,815 --> 01:14:44,215
Yeah, of course she is.

1397
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:46,950
I mean, she's a little uptight, but
that's just the nervous jitters.

1398
01:14:46,985 --> 01:14:48,819
But she did ask me
to give you this

1399
01:14:48,854 --> 01:14:51,388
and she said that you should
have something for her.

1400
01:14:51,423 --> 01:14:54,256
And if you don't, I'm supposed
to wait here until you do.

1401
01:14:54,292 --> 01:14:58,561
- I think it's code.
- Okay. Here.

1402
01:14:58,596 --> 01:15:00,962
It's really sweet, you know,
exchanging love letters

1403
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:03,631
right before the ceremony.

1404
01:15:03,667 --> 01:15:06,234
There you go.

1405
01:15:06,269 --> 01:15:08,902
- Yay, brother!
- Yay.

1406
01:15:08,938 --> 01:15:11,438
Oh!

1407
01:15:11,474 --> 01:15:13,540
Um... yeah.

1408
01:15:13,576 --> 01:15:15,374
You know what?
We're almost ready to go.

1409
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:17,743
- So you might want to tie that tie.
- Okay.

1410
01:15:21,315 --> 01:15:23,782
Just think of it
as a shoelace for your neck.

1411
01:15:36,661 --> 01:15:38,628
- Hey.
- Hey.

1412
01:15:38,663 --> 01:15:42,297
- Friend of Vick's. We met last week.
- Vince.

1413
01:15:42,333 --> 01:15:45,567
Right. Vince.

1414
01:16:30,441 --> 01:16:32,607
Okay. Okay.

1415
01:16:34,645 --> 01:16:36,478
So sweet.

1416
01:16:48,557 --> 01:16:50,490
Wait.
Close the doors.

1417
01:16:53,794 --> 01:16:57,629
- Honey, it's time.
- I don't think I can do this.

1418
01:16:57,665 --> 01:16:59,330
Of course you can.

1419
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:01,365
No, Vince and I...

1420
01:17:01,401 --> 01:17:04,969
Jennifer, listen to me.

1421
01:17:05,004 --> 01:17:08,338
Your mother and I always doubted
you'd even get married...

1422
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:09,906
Yeah, I know, Dad.
Thanks.

1423
01:17:09,942 --> 01:17:13,342
Because we never thought
you'd meet anybody

1424
01:17:13,377 --> 01:17:15,411
worthy of all you had to offer.

1425
01:17:17,114 --> 01:17:19,547
I couldn't be prouder

1426
01:17:19,583 --> 01:17:21,416
of the woman you've become.

1427
01:17:23,653 --> 01:17:26,587
And I'm really sorry I haven't
always told you that.

1428
01:17:34,062 --> 01:17:35,761
Dad, I just...
I need to tell you...

1429
01:17:35,797 --> 01:17:37,563
Sweetheart...

1430
01:17:41,735 --> 01:17:44,669
I know you're scared.

1431
01:17:44,705 --> 01:17:47,838
And as hard as it's gonna be
for me to give you away,

1432
01:17:47,873 --> 01:17:50,374
I know you're gonna
be in good hands.

1433
01:17:50,409 --> 01:17:52,743
Vince loves you.

1434
01:17:58,617 --> 01:18:00,116
Okay?

1435
01:18:22,136 --> 01:18:25,704
- Wow.
- I know.

1436
01:18:52,429 --> 01:18:54,763
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here

1437
01:18:54,798 --> 01:18:57,631
to join this man and this woman

1438
01:18:57,667 --> 01:19:00,634
in the sacred bonds
of holy matrimony.

1439
01:19:00,670 --> 01:19:02,836
I have had the chance
to spend time

1440
01:19:02,872 --> 01:19:04,637
with Jennifer and Vince,

1441
01:19:04,673 --> 01:19:07,507
and their unusually strong
feelings for one another

1442
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:09,809
are quite apparent.

1443
01:19:09,844 --> 01:19:12,544
I've done this job
long enough to know

1444
01:19:12,579 --> 01:19:14,046
when a couple is getting married

1445
01:19:14,081 --> 01:19:16,615
for the wrong reasons.

1446
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:19,083
Some, they're in love
with an idealized version

1447
01:19:19,118 --> 01:19:21,052
of the person they are marrying.

1448
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:23,854
Others feel that
they're simply too old

1449
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:25,522
to be single anymore.

1450
01:19:25,557 --> 01:19:28,925
And some... well, some
just want all the gifts.

1451
01:19:37,068 --> 01:19:38,733
That's ridiculous.

1452
01:19:38,768 --> 01:19:40,735
But what they don't realize is

1453
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:44,138
that marriage is a journey.

1454
01:19:44,174 --> 01:19:45,939
A wonderful, exciting

1455
01:19:45,974 --> 01:19:48,175
and at times
excruciating journey.

1456
01:19:50,045 --> 01:19:53,979
- Am I right?
- Yes.

1457
01:19:54,015 --> 01:19:57,083
But Jennifer and Vince,

1458
01:19:57,118 --> 01:20:00,885
they see each other
for who they really are.

1459
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:03,822
There are no rose-colored
glasses on these two,

1460
01:20:03,857 --> 01:20:05,423
not at all.

1461
01:20:05,459 --> 01:20:06,990
They are standing here today

1462
01:20:07,026 --> 01:20:08,859
committing to each other,

1463
01:20:08,894 --> 01:20:11,228
knowing full well
what they are getting into.

1464
01:20:12,965 --> 01:20:16,632
The couple has elected
to recite their own vows.

1465
01:20:16,668 --> 01:20:18,835
- Vince.
- Yeah?

1466
01:20:18,870 --> 01:20:21,670
- The vows.
- Oh, right.

1467
01:20:28,511 --> 01:20:30,211
Jennifer,

1468
01:20:30,246 --> 01:20:33,147
I didn't know how loving
a person could be

1469
01:20:33,182 --> 01:20:34,848
until I met you.

1470
01:20:41,789 --> 01:20:43,455
I can't.

1471
01:20:43,491 --> 01:20:45,157
I just cannot do this.

1472
01:20:50,163 --> 01:20:51,929
I've gotta speak
from the heart here.

1473
01:20:51,965 --> 01:20:53,998
- Mm-mmm.
- Jennifer...

1474
01:20:55,501 --> 01:20:58,568
You are the most frustrating person

1475
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:00,170
I have ever met.

1476
01:21:00,205 --> 01:21:02,304
You are opinionated

1477
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:05,808
and stubborn and at times

1478
01:21:05,843 --> 01:21:08,743
really really

1479
01:21:08,779 --> 01:21:10,478
really bossy.

1480
01:21:15,519 --> 01:21:17,151
And that is why I've
fallen in love with you.

1481
01:21:19,555 --> 01:21:21,188
I didn't plan on it, believe me.

1482
01:21:21,223 --> 01:21:25,057
It just happened.
And along the way I...

1483
01:21:25,093 --> 01:21:27,727
Noticed your generosity,

1484
01:21:27,762 --> 01:21:30,529
your kindness...

1485
01:21:31,865 --> 01:21:33,999
Your great sense of humor

1486
01:21:34,034 --> 01:21:36,801
and just your basic sense of decency.

1487
01:21:41,007 --> 01:21:42,706
You're an amazing woman, Jennifer.

1488
01:21:46,144 --> 01:21:48,311
And I would be proud
to call you my wife.

1489
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:57,285
Jennifer, it's your turn now.

1490
01:22:01,658 --> 01:22:03,791
Read your vows.

1491
01:22:20,674 --> 01:22:22,173
It was my grandmother's.

1492
01:22:26,278 --> 01:22:28,312
We're not quite
to the rings yet, guys.

1493
01:22:29,548 --> 01:22:32,615
What do you say?

1494
01:22:37,288 --> 01:22:39,621
You know, I-I pride myself
on being able to read people.

1495
01:22:41,925 --> 01:22:44,860
And when I met you, Vince,
I thought you were

1496
01:22:44,895 --> 01:22:47,761
sloppy and lazy
and a ladies' man.

1497
01:22:49,098 --> 01:22:51,732
And I was right.

1498
01:22:51,767 --> 01:22:55,235
In fact, that was all I could see.

1499
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:57,737
But every day that I've spent with
you, I have found little things

1500
01:22:57,772 --> 01:23:00,072
that I love about you.

1501
01:23:00,107 --> 01:23:03,709
Like the way you light up when
your mom walks in a room.

1502
01:23:03,744 --> 01:23:06,844
Or the way you make
my niece and nephew laugh.

1503
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,281
And ever since then, I just...

1504
01:23:10,316 --> 01:23:13,984
I don't know, I just love all
those little things about you.

1505
01:23:17,356 --> 01:23:18,922
I love you, Vince.

1506
01:23:25,196 --> 01:23:27,695
- Is that a yes?
- Yes.

1507
01:23:27,731 --> 01:23:29,831
- Okay.
- Yes.

1508
01:23:31,568 --> 01:23:33,034
Yes.

1509
01:23:34,970 --> 01:23:36,637
Guys, the kissing
comes later too.

1510
01:23:36,672 --> 01:23:39,172
We're still at vows.

1511
01:23:39,208 --> 01:23:42,041
Vince, do you take Jennifer
to be your lawful wedded wife?

1512
01:23:42,076 --> 01:23:44,911
Jennifer, do you take Vince to
be your lawful wedded husband?

1513
01:23:44,946 --> 01:23:46,612
I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

1514
01:23:46,648 --> 01:23:48,180
You may... do that.

1515
01:23:57,657 --> 01:23:59,156

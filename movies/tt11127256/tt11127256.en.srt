2
00:00:37,152 --> 00:00:40,012
This day wasn't
particularly a good one for him.

3
00:00:40,062 --> 00:00:41,911
He was 10 minutes late for the train,

4
00:00:41,961 --> 00:00:43,652
and as a result, he had
to take the next one

5
00:00:43,702 --> 00:00:46,031
that left an hour later.

6
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:48,369
The schedule that he had
meticulously planned for the day

7
00:00:48,419 --> 00:00:51,810
fell to the wayside, but
it didn't matter to him.

8
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,372
He knew that if he had to live his life

9
00:00:53,422 --> 00:00:56,223
by times and rhythms, that
he could never achieve

10
00:00:56,273 --> 00:00:58,372
what it was that he wanted.

11
00:00:58,422 --> 00:01:00,961
At least, not in any satisfactory way

12
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:02,252
that he could wake up the next day

13
00:01:02,302 --> 00:01:05,143
and felt that he had
achieved enough to move on.

14
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:28,909
He nevertheless had achieved
what he had wanted that day,

15
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,848
and felt that he could
take a breath and sit.

16
00:01:31,898 --> 00:01:34,269
Tomorrow was another day, and the dread of

17
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,728
and responsibilities of tomorrow

18
00:01:35,778 --> 00:01:37,538
would keep him up this night.

19
00:01:41,365 --> 00:01:43,658
This day was very different for him.

20
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:46,557
He vowed every night that
he would change his ways.

21
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,429
He told himself this every night,

22
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,528
and truly believed that he could change.

23
00:01:54,788 --> 00:01:58,309
Yes, he wanted to change,
he wanted to be different.

24
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,808
- You like that, don't you?

25
00:02:09,858 --> 00:02:11,746
Love those old-fashioned tape machines.

26
00:02:11,796 --> 00:02:14,026
We don't sell much of those anymore.

27
00:02:14,076 --> 00:02:16,666
I gotta be honest with you, you know,

28
00:02:16,716 --> 00:02:19,456
it's all landfill now,
those old tape machines.

29
00:02:27,003 --> 00:02:27,836
- My baby.

30
00:02:37,317 --> 00:02:39,195
- The other advantage
is jerkin' off to porn,

31
00:02:39,245 --> 00:02:41,675
you know the digital
stuff runs a little fast.

32
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:45,246
I've still got my old VHS
stash to jerk off to.

33
00:02:48,664 --> 00:02:49,914
You interested?

34
00:02:50,865 --> 00:02:52,366
- Yeah, yeah, I'll take it.

35
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,075
- Cool, 150 bucks.

36
00:02:58,056 --> 00:02:58,856
But the impulse was too strong

37
00:02:58,906 --> 00:03:00,816
that it overtook him.

38
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:04,576
Once he had crossed that
line, there was no going back.

39
00:03:04,626 --> 00:03:08,886
He had done this before,
but day 11 was different.

40
00:03:08,936 --> 00:03:11,063
Day 11 was significant

41
00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:14,304
because he had felt something
for her, something genuine.

42
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:19,653
He remembered how he first met her.

43
00:03:19,703 --> 00:03:22,872
This was the decision that
would change his life forever.

44
00:04:48,901 --> 00:04:51,234
That's an old one, isn't it?

45
00:04:52,981 --> 00:04:53,791
- Yeah.

46
00:04:53,841 --> 00:04:58,260
That's tape, right?

47
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,810
You know, like Betamax or VHS?

48
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:03,162
- Yeah.

49
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:09,210
- My dad has stacks and
decks sitting in his closet.

50
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,677
Hasn't used it in many years.

51
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,210
He has a lotta cool stuff.

52
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,831
I used to see his tapes
scattered on the floor.

53
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:20,580
- You still close to your dad?

54
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,463
- Yeah.

55
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,975
Yeah, he's saved me a lotta times.

56
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,106
No!

57
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,160
No!

58
00:05:47,377 --> 00:05:48,210
- Saved?

59
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:51,441
- You know.

60
00:05:53,415 --> 00:05:55,325
How old are you?

61
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,208
- 17.

62
00:05:59,036 --> 00:06:02,536
Well, I don't mean he saved me like Jesus.

63
00:06:03,521 --> 00:06:07,794
I just mean that
when I fell down during times,

64
00:06:07,844 --> 00:06:10,103
you know, like difficult
times in the past?

65
00:06:30,942 --> 00:06:32,411
- But you're only 17.

66
00:06:32,461 --> 00:06:34,023
- And?

67
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:37,895
Well.

68
00:06:40,172 --> 00:06:43,171
My father's been the only
one I can look up to.

69
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:46,138
He has saved me, he has rescued me.

70
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:52,776
I have no faith in anyone else.

71
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:56,093
My friends are all backstabbers.

72
00:06:56,143 --> 00:06:58,642
- So you don't have real friends?

73
00:06:58,692 --> 00:06:59,525
- Real?

74
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:02,125
No.

75
00:07:03,663 --> 00:07:06,246
- Nobody you can count on then?

76
00:07:07,103 --> 00:07:08,603
- I give too much,

77
00:07:12,124 --> 00:07:14,362
and they let me down.

78
00:07:14,412 --> 00:07:15,693
- How does that make you feel?

79
00:07:15,743 --> 00:07:17,442
- How would you feel if
your bestie fucked your BF

80
00:07:17,492 --> 00:07:20,543
and didn't give a shit about you?

81
00:07:20,593 --> 00:07:21,760
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

82
00:07:24,623 --> 00:07:29,290
Now, a friend is someone you
can just confess things to.

83
00:07:31,411 --> 00:07:34,903
Like, I can say I want to kill my mom,

84
00:07:34,953 --> 00:07:37,953
or fuck my brother, and that's that.

85
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:45,339
It's like I can't say
anything to anyone anymore,

86
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:48,306
and I don't even have any feelings.

87
00:07:49,307 --> 00:07:53,399
My friends reject me because
I don't go to church.

88
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:55,866
Sometimes I wish I could just

89
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,223
fly away.

90
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:05,021
Brandon knew he had found her.

91
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,170
- I beg you.

92
00:09:11,741 --> 00:09:13,062
Why are you doing this?

93
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:20,201
No, don't do that.

94
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,753
Please.

95
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,753
Stop!

96
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:51,996
- Your dad, he isn't doing too well.

97
00:10:53,805 --> 00:10:55,388
- You spoke to him?

98
00:10:56,585 --> 00:10:58,668
- He called from Memphis.

99
00:10:59,566 --> 00:11:04,566
I guess all that drinking and
binging finally got to him,

100
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,700
the bastard.

101
00:11:08,054 --> 00:11:09,554
He needs dialysis.

102
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:13,003
That's the least of it.

103
00:11:14,584 --> 00:11:16,167
He asked about you.

104
00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:23,305
He hopes you find something to do,

105
00:11:23,355 --> 00:11:25,876
something on your own,

106
00:11:25,926 --> 00:11:27,926
without me enabling you.

107
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:33,890
He says you're a failure,

108
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:38,500
and you need to accept that.

109
00:11:40,196 --> 00:11:41,858
And do something.

110
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,512
Hey, you.

111
00:12:39,562 --> 00:12:41,381
Hey.

112
00:12:41,431 --> 00:12:43,762
So my mom,

113
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:46,895
she's such a fucking bitch, you know?

114
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:51,168
It's just this disconnection.

115
00:12:52,932 --> 00:12:56,180
I don't think she
understands anything anymore.

116
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,147
I'm doing the best I can, you know?

117
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,813
- Yeah.

118
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,181
I don't have any friends.

119
00:13:07,231 --> 00:13:08,148
I just need

120
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:11,999
someone to talk to some time.

121
00:13:14,714 --> 00:13:16,482
I don't have anyone.

122
00:13:16,532 --> 00:13:17,782
- Yeah, I know.

123
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,292
- Yeah, I don't think Mom wants
me to finish school at all.

124
00:13:24,342 --> 00:13:28,213
I don't think she wants me to stay here.

125
00:13:28,263 --> 00:13:31,839
Dressed like as a fucking
whore, all her life.

126
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:34,536
I don't know what she
sees in those track guys.

127
00:13:34,586 --> 00:13:35,669
- Track guys?

128
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:37,925
- You know, the guys
that run in their shorts

129
00:13:37,975 --> 00:13:39,642
for miles and miles.

130
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:42,647
I don't really know
the point of it anyway,

131
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,399
to run all those miles and
wear off your body like that,

132
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,679
yeah, only to say you're the winner.

133
00:13:46,729 --> 00:13:49,727
Like, what is winning anyway?

134
00:13:49,777 --> 00:13:54,046
I won, well, I sorta won
the spelling bee one year.

135
00:13:54,096 --> 00:13:56,399
I was second place.

136
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:58,282
They gave me a plaque.

137
00:13:59,886 --> 00:14:03,833
I don't even know where it is anymore.

138
00:14:03,883 --> 00:14:06,383
Mom wasn't really proud of it.

139
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:09,711
She said the judges cheated
and that Chinese girl

140
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:12,261
from Monrovia should have won.

141
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:17,182
She didn't like that I had won.

142
00:14:23,451 --> 00:14:24,284
Hmm.

143
00:14:25,171 --> 00:14:29,254
Jesse's texting me now,
wants to know where I am.

144
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:45,654
Wanna be at that star there.

145
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:48,422
That star

146
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,511
is the furthest one away.

147
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:54,394
- Mm-mm.

148
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,871
That's the closest one.

149
00:14:57,921 --> 00:15:00,601
Furthest one is the big one right there.

150
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:02,721
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

151
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:03,604
- Huh.

152
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,389
- I mean, why be far away when
you can be close by, right?

153
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,719

187
00:18:26,211 --> 00:18:28,628
Dahlia, I wanted to call you.

188
00:18:30,941 --> 00:18:32,721
It's been too long.

189
00:18:32,771 --> 00:18:35,102
I know I should have reached out sooner

190
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:39,131
but this week has been incredibly insane.

191
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:40,598
You have no idea.

192
00:18:43,963 --> 00:18:46,463
I wonder, how's Ophelia doing?

193
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:50,045
I miss her, is she okay?

194
00:18:51,111 --> 00:18:52,182
How are her grades?

195
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:53,815
Is she eating okay?

196
00:18:55,614 --> 00:18:59,153
I know, I'm asking too many questions.

197
00:18:59,203 --> 00:19:00,444
I'm really sorry, my dear.

198
00:19:00,494 --> 00:19:02,661
I love you, you know that.

199
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,484
I don't know.

200
00:19:07,534 --> 00:19:11,804
Do you think that we could
attempt to be together again,

201
00:19:11,854 --> 00:19:13,981
at least for Ophelia?

202
00:19:14,031 --> 00:19:16,531
Maybe we can make it work out.

203
00:19:18,294 --> 00:19:23,294
My job's promoting
me to a big case now,

204
00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:27,222
and things will be better financially.

205
00:19:27,272 --> 00:19:29,273
I've amassed quite a bit of savings,

206
00:19:29,323 --> 00:19:31,689
so no more excess anymore, my love.

207
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:32,822
I just wonder

208
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:41,150
if we could give this another chance.

209
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,238
After all we've been through.

210
00:20:17,645 --> 00:20:19,398
Come on, man!

211
00:20:19,448 --> 00:20:21,660
Why don't you do a seizure for once?

212
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,001
Shut up!
- Well, well, well,

213
00:20:23,051 --> 00:20:24,281
look what we have here.

214
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:26,811
- Right, nice, that'll buy you
a few years, won't it, huh?

215
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:27,982
All the evidence we need.

216
00:20:29,952 --> 00:20:30,735
Shut up!

217
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:34,474
Keep gettin' him.

218
00:20:36,572 --> 00:20:38,751
Fuck you, cock sucker!

219
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:39,871
Fuck you!

220
00:20:39,921 --> 00:20:40,772
Hey, hey!

221
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,285
- Yeah, fuck you.

222
00:20:49,254 --> 00:20:52,045
Bugger off, wanker!

223
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,995
I said shut up!

224
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:55,628
- Who are you calling a wanker?

225
00:21:25,222 --> 00:21:27,019
- Detective, here's your papers.

226
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:28,191
Is there anything else you need?

227
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:29,831
- No, that's great, thank you, Samantha.

228
00:21:29,881 --> 00:21:30,780
- How's your boyfriend?

229
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,699
- Good.

230
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:38,583
This is a new prototype.

231
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:39,863
Even the gangs and the Chinese

232
00:21:39,913 --> 00:21:43,119
haven't been able to get
ahold of this one yet.

233
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,321
Pretty soon, we'll be using these on duty.

234
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,048
- Come off it, Tim, really?

235
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,947
- Yeah, anything's possible, isn't it?

236
00:21:49,997 --> 00:21:52,176
I mean, would you have predicted

237
00:21:52,226 --> 00:21:53,815
any of this that's happened,

238
00:21:53,865 --> 00:21:55,968
cars that drive themselves,

239
00:21:56,018 --> 00:21:57,998
phones that know what you wanna eat next,

240
00:21:58,048 --> 00:22:00,546
what music you're gonna listen to?

241
00:22:00,596 --> 00:22:03,227
Guess no real reason for
any of us to exist, right?

242
00:22:03,277 --> 00:22:05,638
I can't even predict this kinda thing.

243
00:22:05,688 --> 00:22:06,827
That's great.

244
00:22:06,877 --> 00:22:09,576
- It was really catching
that pervert last week.

245
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:10,626
- Which one?

246
00:22:13,203 --> 00:22:16,083
- The woods are lovely, dark and deep,

247
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:20,031
but I have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep.

248
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:21,914
- The wood are lovely,

249
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:24,100
dark and deep.

250
00:22:25,413 --> 00:22:27,694
And I have promise to keep.

251
00:22:27,744 --> 00:22:31,077
- These woods are lovely, dark and deep.

252
00:22:32,483 --> 00:22:34,972
And miles before.

253
00:22:40,264 --> 00:22:41,734
- It's over, you're caught.

254
00:22:41,784 --> 00:22:42,813
It's over!

255
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:44,563
You know the crank caller,

256
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,953
the one jerkin' off over the phone

257
00:22:46,003 --> 00:22:47,723
and blind-calling in girls.

258
00:22:47,773 --> 00:22:50,523
Oh, yeah, yeah.

259
00:22:50,573 --> 00:22:52,451
Where were you on the night of April 13th?

260
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:55,584
- I told you, I was in bed, sleeping.

261
00:22:56,452 --> 00:22:57,971
- Right, and somebody
can corroborate this?

262
00:22:58,021 --> 00:23:00,022
Yes.

263
00:23:00,072 --> 00:23:02,155
- You killed John Gaines.

264
00:23:03,053 --> 00:23:05,202
We have three key witnesses

265
00:23:05,252 --> 00:23:07,702
who saw you rob that liquor store,

266
00:23:07,752 --> 00:23:09,690
and kill this guy in cold-blooded murder

267
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,443
when it all went wrong.

268
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:13,193
- It wasn't me.
- It wasn't you.

269
00:23:13,243 --> 00:23:16,163
- It wasn't me.
- It wasn't you.

270
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:17,713
You piece of shit.

271
00:23:32,449 --> 00:23:34,102
- Poor girl.

272
00:23:34,152 --> 00:23:37,793
Coroner thinks it may have only
taken her two hours to die.

273
00:23:37,843 --> 00:23:39,664
With all the markings on her throat,

274
00:23:39,714 --> 00:23:42,843
there were at least a dozen
attempts to strangle her.

275
00:23:42,893 --> 00:23:46,905
My guess is two hours
for it to all go down.

276
00:23:46,955 --> 00:23:49,363
- This is a terrible situation.

277
00:23:49,413 --> 00:23:50,196
- It is.

278
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,903
- Not yet.

279
00:24:12,632 --> 00:24:13,433
Not yet.

280
00:24:45,893 --> 00:24:47,476
You're quiet today.

281
00:24:52,856 --> 00:24:54,689
I'm leaving this town.

282
00:24:58,735 --> 00:25:00,318
Next week, in fact.

283
00:25:01,837 --> 00:25:03,686
No, I did not find religion,

284
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:06,403
but I'm just turning a new leaf.

285
00:25:09,346 --> 00:25:12,917
I'm moving back up to my mom's in Oregon.

286
00:25:12,967 --> 00:25:16,134
I'm going to start a jewelry business.

287
00:25:17,968 --> 00:25:20,718
Oh, no need to be so heartbroken.

288
00:25:24,048 --> 00:25:26,465
There is a very special girl,

289
00:25:27,938 --> 00:25:32,188
very special, and she will
take my place, you know?

290
00:25:35,863 --> 00:25:39,235
It's not like I'm leaving forever.

291
00:25:39,285 --> 00:25:40,614
It's just a thousand miles away.

292
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,331
I'll come visit you.

293
00:25:45,424 --> 00:25:50,091
I have a four p.m. client, I
think you should leave now.

294
00:25:52,856 --> 00:25:55,189
Dahlia, day 289.

295
00:25:56,476 --> 00:25:59,059
Without you, it's not the same.

296
00:26:01,788 --> 00:26:03,985
I've begun writing again.

297
00:26:04,035 --> 00:26:06,138
Well, not actually writing.

298
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:08,007
I've been keeping a journal,

299
00:26:08,057 --> 00:26:12,640
but it's a journal based on
my recollections and dates.

300
00:26:14,348 --> 00:26:18,807
For example, and I know
I have the date wrong,

301
00:26:18,857 --> 00:26:22,309
but do you remember the
time you slapped me?

302
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,858
I have it written down in my journal

303
00:26:23,908 --> 00:26:26,075
as occurring on June 16th.

304
00:26:27,725 --> 00:26:31,321
You'll need to correct me
if I'm wrong about this,

305
00:26:31,371 --> 00:26:33,154
but I remember distinctly that the 15th

306
00:26:33,204 --> 00:26:35,402
was a Sunday that year,

307
00:26:35,452 --> 00:26:38,881
and Monday's paper, I went
to fetch that morning,

308
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:42,201
and then you slapped me that evening.

309
00:26:42,251 --> 00:26:45,834
It didn't hurt, but I
was stunned for sure.

310
00:26:46,961 --> 00:26:50,690
I'd never seen you as physical
as you were that night.

311
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:54,550

- We've been talking about your fears,

342
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:43,476
what it is that's troubling you,

343
00:29:43,526 --> 00:29:44,754
and how we can get to the bottom

344
00:29:44,804 --> 00:29:46,226
where the root of what's causing

345
00:29:46,276 --> 00:29:49,193
this imbalance you're experiencing.

346
00:29:56,098 --> 00:29:57,568
- So, there's this girl,

347
00:29:57,618 --> 00:29:59,957
this incredible girl.

348
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,424
- How old is she?

349
00:30:04,578 --> 00:30:05,828
- 21, maybe 25.

350
00:30:11,196 --> 00:30:15,688
She seems to know how to play
older when she needs to be.

351
00:30:15,738 --> 00:30:18,208
- You mentioned she was murdered.

352
00:30:18,258 --> 00:30:21,341
But isn't murder part of our DNA now?

353
00:30:23,316 --> 00:30:24,973
We've discussed all of this yesterday,

354
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,356
we've been over all of this.

355
00:30:29,463 --> 00:30:32,130
Anything else you wanna tell me?

356
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,005
For one brief moment,

357
00:30:53,055 --> 00:30:55,124
no matter how much we fought,

358
00:30:55,174 --> 00:30:57,185
no matter how much we hated each other...

359
00:30:57,235 --> 00:30:59,718
Yes!

360
00:30:59,768 --> 00:31:00,998
Yes!

361
00:31:01,048 --> 00:31:03,288
Yes!

362
00:31:03,338 --> 00:31:05,027
Pass out, baby.

363
00:31:05,077 --> 00:31:09,608
No matter how much
we wanted to kill each other.

364
00:31:09,658 --> 00:31:11,907
Motherfucker, you!

365
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:16,187
You motherfucker!

366
00:31:16,237 --> 00:31:19,067
The one brief moment,

367
00:31:19,117 --> 00:31:21,587
that one moment when hate turned to love,

368
00:31:21,637 --> 00:31:24,470
it was fleeting, but it was there.

369
00:31:25,538 --> 00:31:28,871
- So, I'm gonna see you tomorrow, right?

370
00:31:34,537 --> 00:31:38,496
You're not seriously thinking
about going back out there

371
00:31:38,546 --> 00:31:41,376
and finding that whole
lolita crowd again, are you?

372
00:31:41,426 --> 00:31:46,426
Because you cannot, Robert,
not anymore, it's dangerous.

373
00:31:46,517 --> 00:31:48,218
Oh, my God, you are!

374
00:31:48,268 --> 00:31:50,147
You're contemplating
jeopardizing everything

375
00:31:50,197 --> 00:31:52,425
and going back out there, aren't you?

376
00:31:52,475 --> 00:31:53,958
You can't, do you understand me?

377
00:31:54,008 --> 00:31:55,617
Like, no fucking way can't.

378
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:58,584
- Stephanie, I must do...
- You must.

379
00:32:01,177 --> 00:32:02,094
You psycho.

380
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,513
Yes, yes.

381
00:32:09,688 --> 00:32:11,110
Pass out.

382
00:32:13,657 --> 00:32:15,997
Yes!

383
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:04,374
What was the first thing you felt?

384
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,057
The room became darker,

385
00:33:07,107 --> 00:33:09,659
like watching the lights go down

386
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:12,209
as the theater program begins.

387
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,331
And do you
remember when you blacked out?

388
00:33:16,381 --> 00:33:18,659
No, it was
like a switch turned off.

389
00:33:18,709 --> 00:33:20,459
No, more like a fade.

390
00:33:21,551 --> 00:33:22,952
It just dimmed out.

391
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:26,228
What do you
remember when you woke?

392
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:29,078
I remember
this intense euphoria.

393
00:33:29,128 --> 00:33:30,909
You got it, baby.

394
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:34,379
No one ever experiences
that the first time.

395
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,598
I'm so impressed you got to that level.

396
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,798
The mind needs to be there

397
00:33:39,848 --> 00:33:42,515
to bring us to full realization.

398
00:33:44,738 --> 00:33:46,321
Day 335.

399
00:33:48,498 --> 00:33:50,081
Dahlia, I need you.

400
00:33:53,253 --> 00:33:56,253
Nothing seems to make sense anymore.

401
00:33:57,271 --> 00:34:00,345
I wake up and don't want to wake up

402
00:34:00,395 --> 00:34:02,478
unless you're next to me.

403
00:34:03,563 --> 00:34:07,581
The coffee I make in the
morning isn't even the same.

404
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:10,972
I can't smell you as I
shower in the morning.

405
00:34:11,022 --> 00:34:13,692
Time just seems to pass by in its own

406
00:34:13,742 --> 00:34:18,325
fleeting butterfly-ous way,
and I can't catch on to it.

407
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:23,623
I can't grasp it in any
way that's meaningful.

408
00:34:26,308 --> 00:34:29,620
And I've been making the wrong choices.

409
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,510
I can't stand what I've become.

410
00:34:45,439 --> 00:34:47,867
Timothy, I know you still
get a thrill out of this all,

411
00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:50,501
but I'm gonna call it quits soon.

412
00:34:50,551 --> 00:34:52,301
- You will, for what?

413
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,850
After being nice guys for so many years?

414
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,149
We busted our asses all these years,

415
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,560
did everything above the board,

416
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:02,240
only so those fucks could get promotions

417
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:04,707
for the cases that we solved.

418
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,589
I have no regrets in
what we're doing, Robert.

419
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:14,970
- Well, it's just enough for me.

420
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,901
If there ever was a thrill,
there isn't one anymore.

421
00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:25,141
- What are you gonna do,
go after your winery then?

422
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:26,541
Assuming they give you
a good enough pension

423
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,821
if you stick it out long enough.

424
00:35:28,871 --> 00:35:30,701
What if I became
the good guy for once?

425
00:35:30,751 --> 00:35:33,060
Good luck, pal.

426
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,109
Can't change a horse's stripes.

427
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,069
- They're zebras.

428
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:37,420
- Same difference.

429
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:40,229
The zebra is a horse,
or whatever they say.

430
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:43,859
We're in too deep, buddy, and you know it.

431
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:46,821
You have to play this out.

432
00:35:46,871 --> 00:35:48,547
You.

433
00:35:48,597 --> 00:35:52,010
- Okay, we if that makes
you feel any better.

434
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,940
Stakes are high, you just
gotta roll with it, baby.

435
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,869
So I think I found her.

436
00:36:01,919 --> 00:36:03,509
Oh?

437
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:04,608
I was at the coffee place

438
00:36:04,658 --> 00:36:07,075
ordering my usual black chai,

439
00:36:08,009 --> 00:36:09,592
and then I saw her.

440
00:36:11,896 --> 00:36:15,338
Same eyes as your girl,
same facial structures.

441
00:36:15,388 --> 00:36:18,246
It's crazy, the resemblance, uncanny.

442
00:36:18,296 --> 00:36:19,600
Her face was like porcelain,

443
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,818
like those antique porcelain dolls.

444
00:36:22,868 --> 00:36:26,868
Her eyes dark, deep blue,
just like your girl's.

445
00:36:28,858 --> 00:36:31,278
So what did you do.

446
00:36:31,328 --> 00:36:33,938
I was literally
frozen, I couldn't move.

447
00:36:33,988 --> 00:36:35,218
I wanted to walk up to her,

448
00:36:35,268 --> 00:36:38,935
but I just couldn't
believe the resemblance.

449
00:36:40,258 --> 00:36:41,091
We spoke.

450
00:36:42,168 --> 00:36:45,338
She admitted she made some
wrong choices early on,

451
00:36:45,388 --> 00:36:48,549
and was just looking to get
back on track with her life.

452
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,698
She's broke, as you might have guessed.

453
00:36:50,748 --> 00:36:54,069
That's where you come
in, if you wanna do this.

454
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:55,560
Okay.

455
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:56,610
- I saw you.

456
00:36:58,569 --> 00:37:01,606
And, well, you were alone, so.

457
00:37:01,656 --> 00:37:04,168
I was alone too, and well,
I was hoping to talk to you

458
00:37:04,218 --> 00:37:06,800
because I was alone too.

459
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,309
I just said that, didn't I?

460
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:10,405
- Yes, you did.
- Yeah.

461
00:37:10,455 --> 00:37:14,363
- You could really
benefit from my sessions.

462
00:37:14,413 --> 00:37:16,013
Here.

463
00:37:16,063 --> 00:37:16,896
Call me.

464
00:37:18,143 --> 00:37:19,925
Are you hesitating?

465
00:37:19,975 --> 00:37:22,544
She said she's done this
type of thing before.

466
00:37:22,594 --> 00:37:23,563
You're sure?

467
00:37:23,613 --> 00:37:25,195
Baby, look me in the eye.

468
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:27,333
Tell me you don't trust me after all

469
00:37:27,383 --> 00:37:29,194
that we've been through.

470
00:37:29,244 --> 00:37:34,244
I don't think you're going to
believe what you see, baby.

471
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:36,433
It's almost like she came
to us from another world

472
00:37:36,483 --> 00:37:38,509
or something because
they knew we wanted her,

473
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:42,738
like some cosmic gift.

474
00:37:42,788 --> 00:37:45,209
Oh, we sound like sci-fi nuts now.

475
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:47,018
Well, at least I do.

476
00:37:47,068 --> 00:37:47,901
Anyway.

477
00:37:49,399 --> 00:37:53,440
I don't know what
I'm doing anymore, Stephanie.

478
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,930
Robert, it's
too late for this now.

479
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,696
From the moment you
stepped into my office,

480
00:37:57,746 --> 00:37:59,749
I knew that we'd get to this level, baby.

481
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:03,137
We said every step of the
way, no matter how hard

482
00:38:03,187 --> 00:38:05,480
or how fucked up it was going to be,

483
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:09,056
we said we could and would just move on.

484
00:38:09,106 --> 00:38:10,269
Am I right?

485
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:12,280
Do you remember this at all?

486
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,656
Or do you only remember the fucking?

487
00:38:14,706 --> 00:38:16,930
There's no regrets, understand?

488
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,230
Do you understand me, baby?

489
00:38:20,106 --> 00:38:22,298
Baby, are you there?

490
00:38:22,348 --> 00:38:23,898
Yes.

491
00:38:23,948 --> 00:38:24,997
If you like her,

492
00:38:25,047 --> 00:38:29,290
then she must come to
Stanton's teachings next week.

493
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,656
Oh, give her 500 bucks, please.

494
00:38:31,706 --> 00:38:33,329
She needs rent money.

495
00:38:33,379 --> 00:38:35,949
Where's she staying?

496
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:38,290
Do you really wanna know?

497
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,480
I guess not.

498
00:39:06,492 --> 00:39:08,783
- A lot of what you experience in life

499
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:12,732
is completely related
and directly inherent

500
00:39:12,782 --> 00:39:17,131
to these preconceived notions
that we have about our lives.

501
00:39:17,181 --> 00:39:18,859
how to live it.

502
00:39:18,909 --> 00:39:21,338
How much of it do you live?

503
00:39:21,388 --> 00:39:24,940
How much are you willing
to live and not hold back

504
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:29,490
and accept the energy of all
of these incoming forces?

505
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:33,498
Therefore, we like to stress

506
00:39:33,548 --> 00:39:37,040
that this will be a highly individual

507
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:39,450
and personal experience for you,

508
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,268
'cause it takes time, it
takes years of living life,

509
00:39:43,318 --> 00:39:46,428
perhaps, to be in full balance,

510
00:39:46,478 --> 00:39:50,215
to experience the ultimate,
the right mindset,

511
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:53,098
the right body, touch your nerves.

512
00:39:56,258 --> 00:39:57,175
Touch them.

513
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:00,839
We're all circuit.

514
00:40:02,238 --> 00:40:03,758
Feel it!

515
00:40:03,808 --> 00:40:05,849
Feel yourselves.

516
00:40:05,899 --> 00:40:07,399
Feel the physical.

517
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:09,901
Feel the emotional.

518
00:40:11,299 --> 00:40:13,537
But what is emotion?

519
00:40:13,587 --> 00:40:18,097
Because what we think, it's
psychological, isn't it?

520
00:40:18,147 --> 00:40:20,657
And this psychological force, this energy,

521
00:40:20,707 --> 00:40:22,207
these cosmic lines

522
00:40:24,518 --> 00:40:26,435
combine and are created

523
00:40:28,768 --> 00:40:30,518
by a physical entity,

524
00:40:32,595 --> 00:40:33,428
a brain,

525
00:40:34,927 --> 00:40:36,260
a goddamn brain!

526
00:40:49,592 --> 00:40:51,113
- We are late.

527
00:40:51,163 --> 00:40:52,163
- I'm sorry.

528
00:40:53,123 --> 00:40:57,790
- We are already conscious
above what they already know.

529
00:40:58,894 --> 00:41:03,394
And we strive to go to places
with our physical bodies

530
00:41:04,538 --> 00:41:06,728
where are physical bodies cannot go,

531
00:41:06,778 --> 00:41:10,195
unless we are one, one with the universe.

532
00:41:12,626 --> 00:41:14,209
Love is the answer.

533
00:41:17,506 --> 00:41:19,339
Love is one continuous

534
00:41:23,604 --> 00:41:24,771
endless dream.

535
00:41:27,004 --> 00:41:28,671
Everyone needs love.

536
00:41:33,095 --> 00:41:36,262
Movement number one, raise your hands.

537
00:41:38,687 --> 00:41:39,604
Raise them.

538
00:41:40,676 --> 00:41:41,509
Higher.

539
00:41:43,236 --> 00:41:44,069
Higher.

540
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:47,266
Higher still.

541
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:55,971
Higher.

542
00:41:56,876 --> 00:41:58,488
Higher.

543
00:41:58,538 --> 00:41:59,957
Reach for the sky.

544
00:42:03,105 --> 00:42:04,772
Movement number two.

545
00:42:08,236 --> 00:42:10,736
- I don't think I can do this.

546
00:42:11,836 --> 00:42:13,586
- The mind blocks us,

547
00:42:14,858 --> 00:42:18,927
but there will always
be a metaphysical path.

548
00:42:18,977 --> 00:42:20,227
The mind knows.

549
00:42:22,737 --> 00:42:27,136
Our perceptions of reality
are based upon what we see

550
00:42:27,186 --> 00:42:28,603
and what we read.

551
00:42:30,927 --> 00:42:32,927
But what about feelings?

552
00:42:34,578 --> 00:42:36,245
Feelings is truthful

553
00:42:37,796 --> 00:42:41,879
and do not let them dictate
to you what you feel.

554
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:44,883
Four!

555
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:49,498
Feelings are your own experience,

556
00:42:49,548 --> 00:42:53,917
and you take with it
whatever is inside of you.

557
00:42:53,967 --> 00:42:54,800
4.5!

558
00:42:58,366 --> 00:43:01,917
All these molecules that are
trying to insert themselves

559
00:43:01,967 --> 00:43:04,884
into you and bang you all to hell...

560
00:43:06,008 --> 00:43:08,167
- I know I know can do it.

561
00:43:08,217 --> 00:43:09,050
- Five!

562
00:43:10,016 --> 00:43:10,849
- Please!

563
00:43:11,788 --> 00:43:15,288
- I ask you, you have the right afterwards

564
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,220
to morph with that.

565
00:43:22,711 --> 00:43:23,544
Six!

566
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:27,120
I can!

567
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:33,370
- Reject that cosmic sperm if you choose,

568
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,170
and be whatever it is

569
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,177
you want to be.

570
00:43:53,695 --> 00:43:57,365
The moment she
picked up the vial, she knew.

571
00:43:57,415 --> 00:43:59,885
The crystals melted into her hand

572
00:43:59,935 --> 00:44:02,736
as if they had existed for centuries.

573
00:44:02,786 --> 00:44:05,907
A single salt crystal, a grain harvested

574
00:44:05,957 --> 00:44:08,397
as far as the beginning of time,

575
00:44:08,447 --> 00:44:12,216

- You know, like, two
years ago at my school.

612
00:47:20,355 --> 00:47:23,585
And screw those mothers.

613
00:47:23,635 --> 00:47:25,065
But my school changed their lunch menu

614
00:47:25,115 --> 00:47:27,204
for all the popular
people, like James Steven

615
00:47:27,254 --> 00:47:28,401
and Linda Kendall.

616
00:47:28,451 --> 00:47:30,714
- They changed the lunch
menu 'cause of popular kids?

617
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,445
- Yeah, you can change a lunch menu.

618
00:47:32,495 --> 00:47:35,184
Well, for the elite few, you know,

619
00:47:35,234 --> 00:47:37,674
the real ones in the know,

620
00:47:37,724 --> 00:47:41,565
we were able to special
order in the morning.

621
00:47:41,615 --> 00:47:42,584
You know, like tell the
teacher in the morning

622
00:47:42,634 --> 00:47:44,685
you didn't want what
everyone else was having,

623
00:47:44,735 --> 00:47:46,864
like the penis dogs.

624
00:47:46,914 --> 00:47:48,143
- What's a penis dog?

625
00:47:48,193 --> 00:47:50,943
- You know, it's like a corn dog,

626
00:47:52,524 --> 00:47:54,034
breaded corn dog?

627
00:47:54,084 --> 00:47:54,984
- What's a breaded corn dog?

628
00:47:55,034 --> 00:47:56,744
- Yeah, it's like the
penis is in the middle

629
00:47:56,794 --> 00:47:59,925
and the breading's the condom!

630
00:47:59,975 --> 00:48:04,975
Well, anyway, when it came
time for us to go to our lunch,

631
00:48:05,055 --> 00:48:08,221
well, we lesbies went
off to the annex portion

632
00:48:08,271 --> 00:48:10,274
of the building where
we'd eat our sub sandwich

633
00:48:10,324 --> 00:48:11,403
and chicken salad.

634
00:48:11,453 --> 00:48:13,674
But hear me out here.

635
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,674
So, since only a handful of
us were sent to the annex

636
00:48:16,724 --> 00:48:18,645
to have lunch while the rest of those

637
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:21,704
Mr. and Mrs. Populars went
off to main cafeteria,

638
00:48:21,754 --> 00:48:24,504
we on the other side were queens.

639
00:48:29,392 --> 00:48:31,725
I remember that V, Veronica,

640
00:48:34,312 --> 00:48:36,933
always tasted like chapstick,

641
00:48:36,983 --> 00:48:39,816
but she had the most amazing lips.

642
00:48:42,014 --> 00:48:46,014
It always matched room
temperature, as I recall.

643
00:48:47,114 --> 00:48:49,864
Meanwhile, Haley was a cold fish.

644
00:48:52,615 --> 00:48:54,282
We had good lunches.

645
00:48:55,655 --> 00:48:59,405
Kinda wish I was back in school again.

646
00:48:59,455 --> 00:49:03,788
Least I had a place to go
to every day at 12:30 p.m.

647
00:49:05,524 --> 00:49:08,607
I don't even know where to go to now.

648
00:49:10,284 --> 00:49:11,784

- On the street that I
live, well, years ago,

673
00:50:56,722 --> 00:50:57,543
there was this ice cream truck

674
00:50:57,593 --> 00:50:59,403
that used to come by our house.

675
00:50:59,453 --> 00:51:02,143
And you could hear the chimes, the melody,

676
00:51:02,193 --> 00:51:04,276
it goes so far, far away.

677
00:51:05,192 --> 00:51:06,664
I remember that feeling, you know,

678
00:51:06,714 --> 00:51:08,992
like the anticipation
of what it all meant.

679
00:51:09,042 --> 00:51:09,843
Before I knew it, my brother and I

680
00:51:09,893 --> 00:51:11,912
were at the front of the truck,

681
00:51:11,962 --> 00:51:14,740
'cause it arrived at our house.

682
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:16,792
Sometimes it came by too quickly though,

683
00:51:16,842 --> 00:51:20,952
and the satisfaction wasn't quite there.

684
00:51:21,002 --> 00:51:22,272
Like, you know when you were
wanting something so bad

685
00:51:22,322 --> 00:51:24,614
that the build-up is
the best thing about it,

686
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:27,982
and the actual feeling
in the end isn't as much?

687
00:51:28,032 --> 00:51:29,782
You know what I mean?

688
00:51:31,784 --> 00:51:36,363
Like, it wasn't the orgasm you
thought you were building up.

689
00:51:36,413 --> 00:51:38,246
Like it was a letdown.

690
00:51:41,851 --> 00:51:43,268
I wish I could...

691
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,853
I wish I could just shut up.

692
00:53:50,489 --> 00:53:52,674
- Say it, whore, say it!

693
00:53:52,724 --> 00:53:55,224
Get motherfuckin' whore money!

694
00:53:56,404 --> 00:54:00,244
I earned every goddamned dollar
of my fuckin' life honestly!

695
00:54:00,294 --> 00:54:02,570
Never in my life, never think
my daughter would be a whore,

696
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,640
a cock-suckin' whore!

697
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:06,652
Whore, say it, say it!

698
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,369
Motherfuckin' whore!

699
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:11,159
Never in my life!

700
00:54:11,209 --> 00:54:13,271
Daughter does this to me!

701
00:54:13,321 --> 00:54:15,087
Never in my life would I think

702
00:54:15,137 --> 00:54:16,409
my daughter would be a whore.

703
00:54:16,459 --> 00:54:18,999
Cock-sucking, common, drinkin' whore!

704
00:55:32,229 --> 00:55:34,229
- It didn't really hurt.

705
00:55:36,613 --> 00:55:40,451
I don't know if it's
that I'm just used to it,

706
00:55:40,501 --> 00:55:42,418
or that I got stronger,

707
00:55:44,573 --> 00:55:45,573
or tolerant,

708
00:55:49,501 --> 00:55:50,334
or numb.

709
00:55:53,255 --> 00:55:54,338
I still feel,

710
00:55:58,165 --> 00:55:59,582
I feel you still.

711
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:03,042
Know what I mean?

712
00:56:05,975 --> 00:56:08,058
It's like that guy on TV,

713
00:56:09,874 --> 00:56:13,435
that Indian guy that
says you can conquer all,

714
00:56:13,485 --> 00:56:16,216
your pain, your everything that hurts you,

715
00:56:16,266 --> 00:56:19,384
ails you, bothers you, and
with one push on your head

716
00:56:19,434 --> 00:56:23,601
with his hand, you are
cured and you feel nothing.

717
00:56:34,535 --> 00:56:36,202
Give me a countdown.

718
00:56:37,554 --> 00:56:38,387
- What?

719
00:56:40,845 --> 00:56:42,678
- Give me a countdown.

720
00:56:44,685 --> 00:56:47,835
You know, like 10, nine, eight.

721
00:56:47,885 --> 00:56:50,375
- Okay, 10, nine, eight.

722
00:56:50,425 --> 00:56:51,258
- No.

723
00:56:53,706 --> 00:56:54,706
Not so fast.

724
00:56:57,354 --> 00:56:58,805
Do it slow, please.

725
00:57:08,628 --> 00:57:09,506
- 10,

726
00:57:17,043 --> 00:57:17,876
nine,

727
00:57:20,783 --> 00:57:21,616
eight,

728
00:57:25,321 --> 00:57:26,154
seven,

729
00:57:29,841 --> 00:57:30,674
six,

730
00:57:35,127 --> 00:57:35,960
five,

731
00:57:40,519 --> 00:57:41,352
four,

732
00:57:47,856 --> 00:57:48,639
three.

733
00:57:55,306 --> 00:57:56,723
- Say it, please.

734
00:57:58,706 --> 00:57:59,539
T-t-t-two.

735
00:58:03,425 --> 00:58:04,258
- Two.

736
00:58:07,586 --> 00:58:08,419
- Say it!

737
00:58:09,284 --> 00:58:12,867
One.

738
00:58:32,003 --> 00:58:33,344
What he wanted to say then,

739
00:58:33,394 --> 00:58:34,853
he clearly couldn't say.

740
00:58:34,903 --> 00:58:36,666
He couldn't even form the
words that would describe

741
00:58:36,716 --> 00:58:39,455
what would become an incredible hatred.

742
00:58:39,505 --> 00:58:41,394
Not a hatred directly against her,

743
00:58:41,444 --> 00:58:44,346
but for whoever made her
become what she became.

744
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:47,874
He called these the
horrible, the awful elements,

745
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:49,885
the ones that would ruin everything.

746
00:58:49,935 --> 00:58:52,335
But the forces who could
take anything that was good,

747
00:58:52,385 --> 00:58:55,274
anything that ever meant
anything meaningful and good,

748
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:57,965
good he kept seeing, and
then just ruin it all,

749
00:58:58,015 --> 00:58:59,615
just ruin the happiness,

750
00:58:59,665 --> 00:59:01,782
and that's all whatever the
forces that he had reckoned

751
00:59:01,832 --> 00:59:02,615
and struggled with.

752
00:59:02,665 --> 00:59:05,003
These were the ones ruining his happiness,

753
00:59:05,053 --> 00:59:06,974
and so the rest had to go.

754
00:59:07,024 --> 00:59:08,702
But he was very humble.

755
00:59:08,752 --> 00:59:10,832
He never stole anyone's happiness.

756
00:59:10,882 --> 00:59:13,462
He was only selfish to a point.

757
00:59:13,512 --> 00:59:14,982
But he said "thank you" whenever he felt

758
00:59:15,032 --> 00:59:18,662
he had received the correct
service at a diner, for example.

759
00:59:18,712 --> 00:59:21,100
And even though he didn't
really show his appreciation

760
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:25,282
to any man or god, he felt the reverence.

761
00:59:27,269 --> 00:59:29,647
Time seemed to stand still for Brandon

762
00:59:29,697 --> 00:59:33,499
and operated at a slow crawl, increments,

763
00:59:33,549 --> 00:59:35,299
decibels, micro ions.

764
00:59:37,368 --> 00:59:40,059
He didn't know what it all meant.

765
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:43,478
For Jeanie, it was the start of a life.

766
00:59:43,528 --> 00:59:47,316
And for Brandon, while
it had the joy of a life,

767
00:59:47,366 --> 00:59:50,048
the beauty, while it
all stood still for him

768
00:59:50,098 --> 00:59:54,190
whenever he was with Jeanie, it just ended

769
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,878
when she came to his world,

770
00:59:55,928 --> 00:59:57,950
because she hadn't come from there.

771
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,099
She was a gift, as
Stephanie had told Robert,

772
01:00:01,149 --> 01:00:04,118
but the gift was actually
meant for Brandon.

773
01:00:04,168 --> 01:00:07,808
He'd waited all his life for
someone who would look at him,

774
01:00:07,858 --> 01:00:10,508
just acknowledge his existence.

775
01:00:10,558 --> 01:00:13,107
He never knew when the
person he was next to

776
01:00:13,157 --> 01:00:15,258
knew if he was even there.

777
01:00:15,308 --> 01:00:18,309
He just wanted to know he was there,

778
01:00:18,359 --> 01:00:20,738
and Jeanie told him he was there.

779
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:30,578
Hi, it's me, leave a message.

780
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:31,461
- Day 301.

781
01:00:34,519 --> 01:00:35,879
It's a big number, isn't it?

782
01:00:39,489 --> 01:00:42,477
I thought about the
first time we went out,

783
01:00:42,527 --> 01:00:45,994
and me being crazy when I was back then,

784
01:00:46,044 --> 01:00:48,794
I asked you out for a midnight date,

785
01:00:48,844 --> 01:00:52,305
and you accepted, to my surprise.

786
01:00:52,355 --> 01:00:54,594
Do you remember that?

787
01:00:54,644 --> 01:00:56,674
No, you looked so beautiful.

788
01:00:56,724 --> 01:00:59,757
You didn't say a single word,
but I knew it in your eyes.

789
01:00:59,807 --> 01:01:02,457
You really believed in me.

790
01:01:02,507 --> 01:01:04,257
I could see the love.

791
01:01:05,596 --> 01:01:07,013
I saw your smile.

792
01:01:09,938 --> 01:01:13,021
It was late and you had no makeup on,

793
01:01:14,276 --> 01:01:15,443
and I saw you.

794
01:01:17,588 --> 01:01:21,255
You, that's what I
remember of you the most.

795
01:01:22,287 --> 01:01:25,704
I just don't want to lose those memories.

796
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,708
Now I don't even know if
you have them anymore.

797
01:01:31,758 --> 01:01:32,758
Was I there?

798
01:01:35,239 --> 01:01:39,780
I don't even know if it
was, but I know I saw you.

799
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:43,549
You existed and you were there for me.

800
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:47,614
And I, I was a...

801
01:01:57,985 --> 01:02:00,984
For Brandon, it was easy.

802
01:02:01,034 --> 01:02:04,194
He knew who did it, who corrupted Jeanie.

803
01:02:04,244 --> 01:02:07,074
This elite group, they
controlled everything,

804
01:02:07,124 --> 01:02:10,714
the media, banks, state
parks, commercial real estate,

805
01:02:10,764 --> 01:02:12,714
ecology, the environment, technology,

806
01:02:12,764 --> 01:02:14,855
and everything that he had ever missed.

807
01:02:14,905 --> 01:02:17,954
It wasn't even intuition,
because Brandon knew.

808
01:02:18,004 --> 01:02:20,332
He had felt this woman,
the woman who had destroyed

809
01:02:20,382 --> 01:02:23,394
every feeling he had
ever felt in his life,

810
01:02:23,444 --> 01:02:26,271
a woman so selfish, so
absorbed, so charmed

811
01:02:26,321 --> 01:02:28,973
with the immediacy of
being accepted by anyone,

812
01:02:29,023 --> 01:02:31,351
even the homeless, wig-less, thief scumbag

813
01:02:31,401 --> 01:02:33,179
taking a shit on the curb.

814
01:02:33,229 --> 01:02:36,691
His acceptance meant everything to her.

815
01:02:36,741 --> 01:02:39,882
It was obvious the way
Stephanie had corrupted Jeanie.

816
01:02:39,932 --> 01:02:42,265
She had done it so expertly.

817
01:02:44,111 --> 01:02:48,128
- So today, we're gonna start
with the basic principles

818
01:02:48,178 --> 01:02:50,461
of what we're trying to achieve.

819
01:02:50,511 --> 01:02:53,250
And by that, I mean we're
going to try to blend

820
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:56,169
the metaphysical with the physical,

821
01:02:56,219 --> 01:03:00,386
and that way, we can get
to that level of euphoria

822
01:03:01,372 --> 01:03:04,351
that's so important for mental health.

823
01:03:04,401 --> 01:03:05,184
- Cool.
- So we're gonna begin

824
01:03:05,234 --> 01:03:07,250
with the basics.
- Okay.

825
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,883
- Just sit up straight with me.

826
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:15,233
And we're gonna start by
facing our thumbs together.

827
01:03:16,509 --> 01:03:21,040
Beautiful, and now you're just
gonna wrap around your neck,

828
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:24,340
and just, I like to kinda ease into it.

829
01:03:26,658 --> 01:03:27,491
Beautiful.

830
01:03:28,618 --> 01:03:32,539
And now we're gonna find
that beautiful sweet spot.

831
01:03:32,589 --> 01:03:33,659
You got it.

832
01:03:43,061 --> 01:03:45,222
Why again, Steph?

833
01:03:45,272 --> 01:03:48,880
Haven't you learned by now it's
not about being insatiable?

834
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:52,010
You want too much, and
now you're using others

835
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:53,340
to do it for you.

836
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:55,789
Don't sacrifice this girl, please.

837
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:58,479
She's young, she's innocent.

838
01:03:58,529 --> 01:04:01,469
Just let her live her life for once.

839
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:05,799
Let her find love,
disappointment, let her live.

840
01:04:05,849 --> 01:04:07,941
Will you give her a chance?

841
01:04:07,991 --> 01:04:11,469
I see her eyes, her eyes
show that she has a chance,

842
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,349
unlike the others.

843
01:04:13,399 --> 01:04:15,189
How do you feel?

844
01:04:15,239 --> 01:04:16,570
- Good.

845
01:04:19,627 --> 01:04:22,258
- There you go, perfect.

846
01:04:22,308 --> 01:04:23,130
Yes.

847
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:25,400
A little more.

848
01:04:27,277 --> 01:04:28,360
Oh, yes, yes!

849
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:32,469
Yes!

850
01:04:32,519 --> 01:04:33,848
There you go.

851
01:04:33,898 --> 01:04:35,090
There you go.

852
01:04:36,908 --> 01:04:37,741
Yes.

853
01:04:38,828 --> 01:04:39,911
You got this.

01:04:41,266 --> 01:04:46,266

- So, who did you say
recommended me to you again?

866
01:06:01,236 --> 01:06:02,069
- Jeanie.

867
01:06:03,615 --> 01:06:05,346
- Right, Jeanie.

868
01:06:05,396 --> 01:06:08,826
I saw you after hours
because of her referral.

869
01:06:08,876 --> 01:06:10,959
I don't normally do that.

870
01:06:14,175 --> 01:06:18,092
Brandon, I can only help
you if you talk to me.

871
01:06:20,415 --> 01:06:22,154
Why did you contact me?

872
01:06:22,204 --> 01:06:25,621
What is troubling you that was so urgent?

873
01:06:30,415 --> 01:06:31,582
How is Jeanie?

874
01:06:37,142 --> 01:06:40,002
Is there something you want
to tell me about Jeanie?

875
01:06:40,052 --> 01:06:42,067
Are you in a relationship with her?

876
01:06:49,917 --> 01:06:52,288
- Like a little sister.

877
01:06:52,338 --> 01:06:55,306
- She's like a little sister.

878
01:06:55,356 --> 01:06:57,515
That's all she is to you, a little sister?

879
01:07:04,066 --> 01:07:08,733
You seem to be upset about
something relating to Jeanie.

880
01:07:10,557 --> 01:07:12,057
- I lost somebody.

881
01:07:14,176 --> 01:07:17,118
- Did something happen
to Jeanie because of you?

882
01:07:17,168 --> 01:07:18,335
- No, no, I'm.

883
01:07:21,026 --> 01:07:23,484
- I can't hear you, what did you say?

884
01:07:23,534 --> 01:07:27,366
Brandon, you have to talk
to me for me to help you.

885
01:07:27,416 --> 01:07:29,999
Did something happen to Jeanie?

886
01:07:31,386 --> 01:07:35,536
We've already gone over the hour allotted,

887
01:07:35,586 --> 01:07:37,076
and I don't think I'm helping you

888
01:07:37,126 --> 01:07:40,293
because you're not telling me anything

889
01:07:42,415 --> 01:07:44,407
to give me a chance to help you.

890
01:07:50,379 --> 01:07:52,061
Brandon, I don't think I can help you.

891
01:07:52,111 --> 01:07:54,130
I think you need to call
a different therapist.

892
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:55,610
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

893
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:56,762
- No.

894
01:07:56,812 --> 01:07:57,595
- It's getting late.

895
01:07:57,645 --> 01:07:58,951
- Sit the fuck down!

896
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:08,529
- There's no need to get upset.

897
01:08:08,579 --> 01:08:09,980
You can tell me what's bothering you.

898
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:13,221
That's what I do, that's
what I can do for you.

899
01:08:13,271 --> 01:08:15,770
I can help you get through this,

900
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:17,640
but you have to talk to me.

901
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:23,290
All right, now this is starting to make me

902
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:26,149
feel a little uncomfortable.

903
01:08:26,199 --> 01:08:27,501
I have to go.

904
01:08:27,551 --> 01:08:28,639
I really mean it...
- Sit down.

905
01:08:28,689 --> 01:08:30,661
- It's time to go, I
really want you to go.

906
01:08:30,711 --> 01:08:33,101
- Sit the fuck down!

907
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,850
You sit and stay the fuck right there!

908
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:38,410
- All right, I'm staying.

909
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:41,210
Okay.

910
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:45,478
- But I want you to leave.

911
01:08:45,528 --> 01:08:46,981
I want you to get the help you need,

912
01:08:47,031 --> 01:08:48,669
and I don't think I can do that.

913
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:49,650
- No, start.

914
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,088
- Please leave.

915
01:09:38,729 --> 01:09:41,312
No!

916
01:11:09,988 --> 01:11:12,571
Where is she now?

917
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,410
You know.

918
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:17,710
I'm so sorry.

919
01:11:19,255 --> 01:11:20,755
You did it nicely?

920
01:11:23,185 --> 01:11:24,435

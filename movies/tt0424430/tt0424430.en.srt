00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:30,128
A Yukisada Isao Film

3
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,008
It's getting closer

4
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,705
What is?

5
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,805
The typhoon

6
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,388
Typhoon?

7
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,619
Typhoon #29

8
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,007
Sweetie

9
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,373
Will we make it?

10
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:27,377
We'll make it

11
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,458
I promise I'll take you there

12
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,029
- Saku!
- Sorry

13
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,073
Morning

14
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:51,833
Good morning

15
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:54,608
Another all-nighter?

16
00:01:55,848 --> 00:01:57,338
You're part-time, right?

17
00:01:58,117 --> 00:01:59,880
Do full-timers work Saturdays, too?

18
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,218
Listen,

19
00:02:05,057 --> 00:02:08,652
Sakutaro is an odd name, no?

20
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,393
Dad was a fan of the poet,
Hagiwara Sakutaro

21
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:14,796
He wrote Chiekosho?

22
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,562
No, not that

23
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:18,192
What, then?

24
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,744
What was it...

25
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,074
You don't even know

26
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:36,612
Wow, some ugly weather

27
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,217
The typhoon's getting close

28
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:44,554
<i>Typhoon #29 is currently</i>

29
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,721
<i>at sea, southwest of Kagoshima,</i>

30
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:51,600
<i>moving north slowly, at about
20 kilometers per hour</i>

31
00:02:52,104 --> 00:02:55,005
<i>We aren't seeing any rain yet,</i>

32
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:58,941
<i>but thick storm clouds are moving in
from the west,</i>

33
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,206
<i>promising a torrent to come...</i>

34
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:04,750
Don't you have a girlfriend?

35
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:06,949
I do

36
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:10,014
So, go home, then

37
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,785
What?

38
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,221
The move

39
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,766
I said, I'm fine

40
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,162
You're the one I'm worried about

41
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,775
It's lonely living alone in the city

42
00:03:35,414 --> 00:03:39,282
Listen, Dad, don't you have
anyone special?

43
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:45,618
Haven't you been lonely since I left?

44
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,266
I'm not making fun of you,
I'm worried

45
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:03,368
It's not like I'm leaving the country

46
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,970
I'll come back and visit

47
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,208
I still had this

48
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:30,093
Excuse me, do you have
any Walkmen?

49
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,393
If you wanted MD players,

50
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,969
they're really compact now

51
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,901
These here all take CDs...

52
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,439
Excuse me,

53
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,407
do you have a Walkman
for playing cassette tapes?

54
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,476
Cassettes?

55
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,433
<i>October 28th...</i>

56
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:48,439
<i>I don't know why...</i>

57
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,701
<i>I can't get to sleep</i>

58
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:01,142
<i>I'm so afraid of tomorrow
that I can't fall asleep</i>

59
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:08,726
<i>I think...</i>

60
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,164
<i>I'm going to die soon</i>

61
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:13,517
CRYING OUT LOVE,
IN THE CENTER OF THE WORLD

62
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,315
<i>I'm going away for a while
Don't worry about me - Ritsuko</i>

63
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:56,764
<i>...the super typhoon, #29,
which struck Kagoshima,</i>

64
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,394
<i>has maintained
its ferocious strength,</i>

65
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,906
<i>traveling north at approximately
15 kilometers per hour</i>

66
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:06,611
<i>The atmospheric pressure at
the center is 950hPa,</i>

67
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,442
<i>the maximum wind speed
near the center is 40 meters,</i>

68
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:14,884
<i>and within the parameters
110 kilometers southeast and...</i>

69
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,612
Welcome

70
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:19,820
Oh, it's you

71
00:09:19,925 --> 00:09:21,790
Helluva welcome

72
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:24,689
I'm starving, Ryu

73
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,197
Eat at home
You've got a cute fianc×™e

74
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:28,823
Whatever

75
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:32,369
Shit

76
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:36,205
I never should've introduced you
to Ritsuko

77
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:41,502
You're marrying her
Better treat her right

78
00:09:45,684 --> 00:09:47,208
What?

79
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,583
Ritsuko is gone

80
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,919
Gone?

81
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:57,485
She left a note,
"I'm going away for a while"

82
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:59,223
A note? That's bad, man

83
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:02,500
You write a note if you're
going to elope, man,

84
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:04,762
or for a double suicide

85
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,599
Double suicide? Suicide?

86
00:10:06,705 --> 00:10:08,229
No way

87
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,329
You call her?

88
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:10,100
No

89
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,733
Call her

90
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,176
Hurry up and call,
her life's at stake

91
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,269
Oh, all right

92
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,939
Hurry

93
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:21,250
<i>...this afternoon, many Kyushu-bound
flights have been canceled,</i>

94
00:10:21,353 --> 00:10:24,049
<i>stranding more than
50, 000 passengers</i>

95
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,290
<i>If Typhoon #29 continues
its northerly course,</i>

96
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,488
<i>it should hit Shikoku
tomorrow afternoon...</i>

97
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,091
Hey, Saku

98
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,063
That's...

99
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:40,697
Ritsuko, isn't it?

100
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:47,911
Why'd you hang up?

101
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,580
But...

102
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:52,146
<i>...we can anticipate many
more canceled flights,</i>

103
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:55,687
<i>and disruption of travel plans
That's all...</i>

104
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:07,596
<i>That's all, from Takamatsu Airport</i>

105
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:13,103
What's Ritsuko doing in Takamatsu?

106
00:11:24,783 --> 00:11:26,080
Hey

107
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,310
Hey, Saku!

108
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:43,958
<i>1986</i>

109
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:10,878
June 24, 1986

110
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:14,583
Mayor, Onuki Shozaburo...

111
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:17,184
Saku! Over here

112
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:20,458
You're late

113
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,090
Sorry

114
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:26,968
Next, an eulogy from a Kobane High
School student, who she taught

115
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:30,372
Hirose Aki, 11th grade

116
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,199
Yes

117
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,772
To Principal Kunimura,

118
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:05,875
I offer my heartfelt condolences
on your passing,

119
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:11,105
and would like to take this opportunity
to thank you for teaching me

120
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,710
Teacher,

121
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:22,892
I wish I had no need to
say these things

122
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:28,799
I really feel great sorrow,
at the sudden news of your death,

123
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:32,296
and I can hardly believe
that I have to stand here

124
00:14:32,704 --> 00:14:36,834
and speak these words,

125
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,708
to a photograph

126
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:42,737
I think of what you always said,

127
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:46,015
"Beginnings are just
continuations of other things,"

128
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,916
about the real meaning
of those words

129
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,752
Our memories of you...

130
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,605
Hirose is amazing

131
00:15:12,744 --> 00:15:16,612
The other girls were just crying
their eyes out

132
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,945
She's like totally mature
or something

133
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,117
Sakutaro!

134
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:10,532
Uncle Shige,
you knew our principal?

135
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,839
She was my first love

136
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,544
I wanted a memorial photograph
of her,

137
00:16:26,718 --> 00:16:28,982
but I couldn't even see her face

138
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,646
No way, this was our principal?

139
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,816
The war was over
and we'd survived

140
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,889
But I was starting over from scratch,

141
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:15,592
lost my whole family,
totally broke

142
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:17,898
So,

143
00:17:19,604 --> 00:17:23,938
I worked like a dog to win her

144
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,678
I did everything but commit murder

145
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:31,009
Like what?

146
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,913
I can't tell you

147
00:17:34,252 --> 00:17:38,120
So I got things together

148
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,083
But then...

149
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,159
But then what?

150
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:53,069
But then, she'd already married
a man her parents had chosen

151
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:58,565
But that's...

152
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,741
Back then,

153
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,777
that's how it was done

154
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:17,684
Hey, Saku,
there aren't any cute girls

155
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,525
I like,

156
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:25,565
like a girl who reads
books on the train

157
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,696
Who's like...

158
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,744
What are you staring at, you lech

159
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:43,384
What's that?

160
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:53,160
Hey, hey, listen, listen!
It's Tachi, the movie star!

161
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,131
- Tachi?
- Tachi Hiroshi

162
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,504
It's a movie shoot,
he's playing some cop

163
00:18:59,604 --> 00:19:01,071
Where? Where?

164
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,231
Over there?

165
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:08,412
Can you call that girl over?

166
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,377
Hirose!

167
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,608
Come here!

168
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,616
Yes

169
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:19,849
It's just a pick-up shot

170
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,483
May we take your picture?

171
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,084
Do you mind?

172
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,187
I'll take your photo

173
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,126
Hey, Tachi is gone

174
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,260
Hey, isn't that Aki?

175
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:34,969
Hey, that's Aki

176
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:38,270
It's Aki, Aki! Why? Why?

177
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,569
What? Her debut?

178
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,879
Debut?

179
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,386
Very nice

180
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:03,701
Ouch

181
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,861
I caught a fool

182
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,733
Ouch, ouch, ouch...

183
00:20:10,775 --> 00:20:12,504
I caught a fool

184
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,920
I knew you came to school
on your motorbike

185
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,463
I've seen you riding it before

186
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,437
Are you going to rat on me?

187
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,014
Hey, what's this?

188
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,414
Here

189
00:20:58,189 --> 00:20:59,087
What?

190
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,452
Hurry

191
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:02,854
Hurry up

192
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,292
Oh, well

193
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,132
Don't hold on so tight

194
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:18,903
Feel my breasts?

195
00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:39,858
Listen, Saku

196
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,293
Please don't

197
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,660
Don't what?

198
00:21:46,404 --> 00:21:48,099
Call me Saku

199
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,441
Everybody calls you that

200
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,601
Just the guys

201
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,669
Well, Nakagawa's a girl

202
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:59,175
She's not really like that,
so it's okay for her, too

203
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,180
Why not me, too, then?

204
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:11,088
When you do it, I feel
like you're teasing me

205
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:13,463
I'm not teasing

206
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,027
You're different from
the other girls, Hirose

207
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,627
I'm different?

208
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:27,577
You're smart and
you're a great athlete,

209
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,613
and you're popular...

210
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,650
You're going into
show business, right?

211
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:45,392
You're like,

212
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,157
a little classier...

213
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,726
It's like you're here

214
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,469
- What?
- Going home

215
00:22:57,575 --> 00:22:59,873
Aren't you riding with me?

216
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:03,277
We live in opposite directions

217
00:23:03,481 --> 00:23:06,109
Then why'd you ask for that ride?

218
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,344
That's a no-brainer

219
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,790
How else could I talk to you?

220
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,902
A score of 82, what a laugh

221
00:24:04,008 --> 00:24:06,067
If I get serious,
I can do a lot better...

222
00:24:06,177 --> 00:24:07,872
Wait a second

223
00:24:10,815 --> 00:24:12,180
What?

224
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:36,734
32,000 Yen, huh

225
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,409
Expensive

226
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,506
You win the same thing,

227
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:47,074
if they read your postcard
on Midnight Wave

228
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:49,480
Midnight Wave?

229
00:24:49,687 --> 00:24:51,484
A late night radio show

230
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,193
Hey, I'll race you!

231
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:58,587
What?

232
00:24:58,696 --> 00:25:02,655
Let's both send postcards and
see who gets the Walkman first

233
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:18,612
I'm home

234
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,048
Welcome home, Sakutaro

235
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:24,721
You're late, was it a girl,
Sakutaro?

236
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,351
Shut up, ugly

237
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,026
Shut up!

238
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:46,971
<i>Whether you're cramming,
working or broken-hearted...</i>

239
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,409
This is it

240
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:53,448
<i>We're coming to you from FMKB</i>

241
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:57,112
<i>So, another round of Midnight Wave,
all night long</i>

242
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:02,783
<i>Our first request comes from a listener
by the pen name, Banana Boat</i>

243
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,454
<i>"SOMEDAY" by Sano Motoharu</i>

244
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:37,388
"The passage year..."

245
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:40,623
"The passing year"

246
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:45,600
"The passing year is yet
another traveling"

247
00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:51,470
So even amnesiacs can laugh
at memories

248
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:53,134
Hey, Saku!

249
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,206
Hirose san

250
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,409
Hirose san

251
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:36,076
We've tallied up votes and

252
00:27:36,754 --> 00:27:41,054
Hirose Aki has been elected
to play Juliet

253
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:55,264
I wonder how Juliet felt
when she woke up

254
00:27:57,275 --> 00:28:00,142
How it feels to have
your lover die first

255
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,913
Ask Uncle Shige

256
00:28:08,786 --> 00:28:10,048
Why?

257
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:11,916
Between you and me,

258
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:16,255
Uncle Shige, who runs the photo studio,
his first love was our principal

259
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:19,555
No way

260
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:21,757
They were planning to marry,

261
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:25,992
but war came and
prevented their union

262
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,140
But it was all in his mind, really

263
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,904
And he still loves her

264
00:28:36,914 --> 00:28:38,939
Fifty years is half a century

265
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:43,146
I can't imagine dreaming of
the same person for half a century

266
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,355
It's lovely

267
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,226
I'd like to hear
Uncle Shige's story

268
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,874
Are you nervous?

269
00:29:07,478 --> 00:29:10,538
With that face, you'll
never get in anywhere

270
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:12,377
Brighten up

271
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,979
What kind of face should I make?

272
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:20,285
I don't know how to smile

273
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:40,641
OK, don't laugh

274
00:29:41,712 --> 00:29:43,111
All right

275
00:29:44,982 --> 00:29:46,347
Done

276
00:29:47,718 --> 00:29:49,447
Thank you

277
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,116
Thanks again

278
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,401
I don't mind telling you...

279
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,379
But not for free

280
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,759
I still say this is nuts

281
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,421
You think?

282
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,589
We could get arrested

283
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:38,100
For what?

284
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:41,230
I think it's romantic and lovely

285
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:43,836
You think?

286
00:30:47,044 --> 00:30:49,911
It'll be so much nicer
with Uncle Shige,

287
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:53,381
than stuck in this desolate place

288
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,314
Isn't that it?

289
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:06,826
What's he going to do
with her bones?

290
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:10,358
Carry them to his grave

291
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,570
Oh, right

292
00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:18,706
Uncle Shige can't share
her grave

293
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,911
Light up the inside

294
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,481
Oh, sorry

295
00:32:02,853 --> 00:32:05,378
In a way, this is like

296
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:08,515
finding eternal love

297
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,835
But it's all over if you die

298
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,278
Shall we ask?

299
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,183
What?

300
00:32:40,691 --> 00:32:44,149
When you die,
does love die, too?

301
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:03,612
- Does love die, too?
- Does love die, too?

302
00:33:03,714 --> 00:33:05,511
Over here, here!

303
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:06,514
Someone's coming

304
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:09,017
Watch your step,
watch your step

305
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:12,046
Listen,

306
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:15,423
I'm covered with bites

307
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:16,788
Sit down

308
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:21,058
This is the most beautiful place
I know, so it's all for you

309
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,394
It's a grave

310
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:26,169
That's Johnny and Nakagawa

311
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:27,268
No way

312
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:32,775
So many mosquitoes

313
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,813
They're dating?

314
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:45,986
Who's there!

315
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,785
Run! Run!

316
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,520
Who's there!

317
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:18,344
Saku?

318
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:23,789
Saku! Hey

319
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:27,357
Hey, Saku, man

320
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,697
It's me, me

321
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:31,597
Johnny?

322
00:34:36,073 --> 00:34:38,200
It's been so long, man

323
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,174
How you been, man?

324
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:42,973
So, you wound up
taking over the temple?

325
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:44,872
Yeah, well

326
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:49,453
And what the hell
are you doing here?

327
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:50,845
Oh, nothing

328
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,479
Not nothing...

329
00:34:57,995 --> 00:34:59,155
Is that Hirose?

330
00:35:01,031 --> 00:35:02,191
Yeah, well

331
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,227
Right

332
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,165
Hirose, huh

333
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:20,842
She was amazing, Hirose was

334
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:24,283
A great athlete,

335
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:27,619
super smart, good at anything

336
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:32,794
To someone like me,
riddled with inferiority,

337
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:34,364
<i>Hirose Family Grave</i>

338
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,730
she was like a stab to the heart

339
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,805
She was so cool

340
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:50,545
About twice a day,
no more than an hour

341
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,579
No more than an hour

342
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:55,379
Oh, really?

343
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:58,650
Hey

344
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,185
Sakutaro!

345
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,390
What, Sakutaro?

346
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,440
Sakutaro?

347
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:26,510
What are you doing back home?

348
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,445
What about your job?

349
00:36:28,552 --> 00:36:30,042
Well...

350
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:34,152
You must be busy with
the wedding coming up

351
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,624
Oh, this is perfect

352
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:42,688
I want you to see
the kimono I'll be wearing

353
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,735
I can't outshine what
Ritsuko is wearing, right?

354
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:49,101
I'll lay it out downstairs,
so take a look, OK?

355
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:33,106
Found it

356
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:37,451
<i>This is Midnight Wave,
coming at you all night long</i>

357
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:40,922
<i>So, let's move on
to our next postcard</i>

358
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:43,220
<i>Pen name, Fried Noodle Bread...</i>

359
00:37:43,627 --> 00:37:44,855
What!

360
00:37:46,096 --> 00:37:50,328
<i>I'm writing today about a tragedy
that befell my classmate,</i>

361
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:54,393
<i>a quiet girl, with long hair</i>

362
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:59,440
<i>Our class decided to stage Romeo
and Juliet for the cultural festival</i>

363
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:03,411
<i>She was going to play Juliet</i>

364
00:38:03,747 --> 00:38:07,774
<i>But she never made it onstage</i>

365
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:10,513
<i>She had leukemia</i>

366
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:14,318
<i>All her long hair fell out,</i>

367
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:18,623
<i>and she grew
unrecognizably gaunt</i>

368
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,237
I won, right?

369
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:32,471
Hey? Were you asleep?

370
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:37,336
I know, you're jealous

371
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,767
Hey

372
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:18,985
Yes

373
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:15,942
The principal's bones...

374
00:41:31,688 --> 00:41:33,781
Hey, Aki!

375
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:06,782
<i>This is Aki</i>

376
00:42:08,992 --> 00:42:11,426
<i>If I see you in person,</i>

377
00:42:11,728 --> 00:42:16,324
<i>I'm afraid I'll either
snub you or slap you,</i>

378
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,530
<i>so I decided to
record this for you</i>

379
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:26,242
<i>Please listen to this on the Walkman
you won with your terrible lie</i>

380
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:31,304
<i>Listen, Saku...</i>

381
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:35,983
<i>The reason I was so furious
with you today,</i>

382
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:41,188
<i>was that I couldn't forgive
the heartless lie you told</i>

383
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,262
<i>I don't think you should
tell lies like that</i>

384
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:50,624
<i>Have you considered
how sick people feel?</i>

385
00:42:52,669 --> 00:42:55,365
<i>What will you do if I die?</i>

386
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:03,274
<i>Uncle Shige's love
lasted this long,</i>

387
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,281
<i>because it was never fulfilled</i>

388
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:10,581
<i>When you're together,
you see the other's faults</i>

389
00:43:12,422 --> 00:43:15,619
<i>That may even push you apart</i>

390
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:22,392
<i>But I like to believe
it only deepens love</i>

391
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:34,308
Um, I'm sorry

392
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,843
I regret what I did

393
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,957
You've got piece of rice
stuck, there

394
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,387
Oh! Disgusting!

395
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,599
It's your turn next

396
00:43:58,235 --> 00:43:59,224
What?

397
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:04,233
Record whatever you
have to say on tape

398
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,400
Then I'll answer you again

399
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:17,410
It's 8 o'clock at night

400
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:25,857
I just had dinner

401
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:27,859
We had croquettes

402
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:35,026
I like soy sauce with my croquettes

403
00:44:35,138 --> 00:44:39,199
Do you prefer soy sauce or regular
sauce with your croquettes?

404
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:43,742
What a ridiculous question

405
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:49,718
<i>Aki...</i>

406
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,855
<i>I really don't know what to say,</i>

407
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,022
<i>so I'll just tell you how I feel</i>

408
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:03,396
<i>Being with you is fun,</i>

409
00:45:05,068 --> 00:45:08,469
<i>and time passes so quickly
when we're together</i>

410
00:45:11,641 --> 00:45:13,575
<i>I know it's a little late, but...</i>

411
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:18,510
<i>Will you go out with me?</i>

412
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,084
Don't laugh

413
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,467
Sure

414
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:42,831
<i>July 14th</i>

00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,933

416
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:52,744
<i>and Matsumoto Sakutaro,
started going out together, but...</i>

417
00:45:53,216 --> 00:45:56,208
<i>Because you still know
so little about me,</i>

418
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,550
<i>I thought I'd introduce myself</i>

419
00:46:00,123 --> 00:46:04,685
<i>Let's see, my birthday,</i>

420
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:10,131
<i>is October 28th, 1969</i>

You sure this is really OK?

Sure, it's fine, leave it to me

462

Hey, what about your girlfriend?

463
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:24,589
She's off shopping right now,

Oh, I get it

If summer ends with you this way,
you'll stay platonic forever

Is that what you want?

468

What are you doing?

469
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,417
What? Nothing

470
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:56,753
Oh, look, a flying fish!

471

They fly so high, beautiful!

472

Wow, incredible

480
00:51:58,214 --> 00:52:00,205
What a wreck

481
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:07,085
A total wreck

482
00:52:13,062 --> 00:52:14,359
Your bag

Are we really staying here?

00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,598
What?

485
00:52:20,336 --> 00:52:21,997
Where else is there?

486
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,820
Saku!

487
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:46,560
What?

488
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:52,060
Hey, hey, Aki, look

489
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:53,362
At this

490
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:58,868
What?

491
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:02,575
Think it still works?

492
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,443
Amazing camera

493
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:10,343
What is this?

494
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:11,613
Cut it out

495
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,780
Get up there a second

496
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:20,388
OK, Cheese

497
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:27,602
No good, it's broken

498
00:53:37,146 --> 00:53:39,706
There's film in there, but...

499
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:45,652
I feel like we've come very far,

500
00:53:46,422 --> 00:53:49,880
from our usual world

501
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,288
Yeah

502
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:58,397
There are just tons of places
we've never been

503
00:54:03,606 --> 00:54:07,440
Ever since I was born,

504
00:54:08,711 --> 00:54:11,475
I haven't been anywhere

505
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:14,812
No, really?

506
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:16,810
Don't make fun of me

507
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,980
I'm sorry, sorry

508
00:54:26,362 --> 00:54:28,159
Actually, neither have I

509
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:32,797
This may be

510
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:37,401
the farthest I've ever gone

511
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:44,077
So today,

512
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:49,915
I feel a little guilty
lying to my parents

513
00:55:10,873 --> 00:55:12,534
You tried

514
00:55:13,042 --> 00:55:15,067
Were you trying to kiss me?

515
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:19,272
I can't?

516
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:23,319
Listen, Saku

517
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,120
Kissing is what you do,

518
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:29,851
when you talk about your dreams

519
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:31,524
Dreams?

520
00:55:33,062 --> 00:55:34,962
I mean dreams...

521
00:55:40,803 --> 00:55:42,600
What are dreams?

522
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,435
I won't tell

523
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,472
No fair

524
00:55:56,252 --> 00:56:01,554
If we develop this,
we might find amazing pictures

525
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:11,657
It suddenly struck me, summer's
almost over

526
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:15,200
Yeah

527
00:56:19,575 --> 00:56:22,009
Who named you Aki,
after the fall?

528
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:26,347
My father

529
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,281
Fall...

530
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:36,719
Reading in fall,

531
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:39,124
sports in fall,

532
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:42,595
fall appetites...

533
00:56:43,966 --> 00:56:44,864
Saku

534
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:51,262
You think they named me
after a season?

535
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:54,503
They didn't?

536
00:56:56,345 --> 00:56:58,575
They called me Aki after,

537
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,484
Hakuaki

538
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:06,220
Hakuaki?

539
00:57:14,263 --> 00:57:16,595
<i>Aki</i>

540
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:18,291
It's the geologic era,

541
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:22,360
when the most new plants and
animals emerged and flourished

542
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:26,474
They named me Aki,
hoping I would flourish, too,

543
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:28,806
the way dinosaurs and ferns did

544
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,136
Like a dinosaur?

545
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:32,578
That's right

546
00:57:35,918 --> 00:57:37,317
Say, Saku

547
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:41,616
Why did they name you Sakutaro?

548
00:57:44,193 --> 00:57:47,594
Because my Dad's a big
Hagiwara Sakutaro fan

549
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:53,858
Hagiwara Sakutaro...

550
00:57:57,306 --> 00:57:59,570
He wrote Chiekosho?

551
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:01,574
No, not that

552
00:58:01,677 --> 00:58:03,144
What, then?

553
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:08,840
What was it?

554
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:11,145
You don't even know

555
00:58:16,592 --> 00:58:18,617
I'm wide awake, now

556
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,598
You're late!

557
00:59:00,805 --> 00:59:02,670
Did you do it?

558
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,832
I couldn't

559
00:59:05,943 --> 00:59:08,002
What a fucking moron

560
00:59:08,112 --> 00:59:10,910
After all the trouble I went to

561
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,979
Saku! Oki!

562
00:59:41,712 --> 00:59:43,179
Aki!

563
01:00:05,236 --> 01:00:10,230
<i>Sakutaro/Aki</i>

564
01:00:19,316 --> 01:00:21,648
Hey, Saku!

565
01:00:22,153 --> 01:00:23,415
Saku!

566
01:00:31,265 --> 01:00:32,289
Aki!

567
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,734
Hey, open the door!

568
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:41,230
Are you OK?

569
01:00:44,278 --> 01:00:46,906
I'm so sorry

570
01:00:48,015 --> 01:00:49,505
Jerk!

571
01:00:57,391 --> 01:00:59,052
You OK, Saku?

572
01:01:13,407 --> 01:01:14,704
Aki

573
01:01:20,715 --> 01:01:22,114
Aki

574
01:01:22,383 --> 01:01:23,873
Aki!

575
01:01:43,271 --> 01:01:47,503
<i>Ever since the day we
went to Yume Island,</i>

576
01:01:47,642 --> 01:01:50,372
<i>my parents have been
kind of upset</i>

577
01:01:51,946 --> 01:01:53,846
<i>But don't worry about it</i>

578
01:01:54,515 --> 01:01:58,178
<i>It's fun, isn't it? Like we're
Romeo and Juliet</i>

579
01:02:04,525 --> 01:02:08,859
<i>It's 8 o'clock in the morning</i>

580
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:13,196
<i>Usually, I'd have left
the house long ago,</i>

581
01:02:13,301 --> 01:02:16,600
<i>but my uniform's
still hanging up,</i>

582
01:02:16,704 --> 01:02:18,831
<i>and I haven't even had breakfast</i>

583
01:02:20,207 --> 01:02:25,304
<i>Actually, I'm going
into the hospital today</i>

584
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:32,318
<i>But please don't worry</i>

585
01:02:33,921 --> 01:02:37,049
<i>My feelings for you are the same</i>

586
01:02:40,962 --> 01:02:44,125
<i>I've left you proof at school</i>

587
01:02:46,167 --> 01:02:49,466
<i>How'd you like
a little treasure hunt?</i>

588
01:02:52,707 --> 01:02:56,905
<i>Start outside the science lab,</i>

589
01:03:04,085 --> 01:03:07,145
<i>at the end of the long,
hushed hallway</i>

590
01:03:13,427 --> 01:03:15,395
<i>Go inside it</i>

591
01:03:26,974 --> 01:03:31,104
<i>Isn't there something
exciting about a lab?</i>

592
01:03:31,746 --> 01:03:34,977
<i>As if there's some secret</i>

593
01:03:37,718 --> 01:03:41,449
<i>Beakers, flasks,</i>

594
01:03:41,989 --> 01:03:43,581
<i>microscopes,</i>

595
01:03:44,091 --> 01:03:46,423
<i>the smell of spirit lamps</i>

596
01:03:49,497 --> 01:03:53,661
<i>Look at the desk at the back,
by the window</i>

597
01:04:26,801 --> 01:04:31,795
<i>Hirose Aki spent a drowsy
lecture here - 1986</i>

598
01:05:16,784 --> 01:05:18,376
Saku

599
01:05:40,641 --> 01:05:42,768
<i>I love the gym</i>

600
01:05:44,211 --> 01:05:46,202
<i>The high ceiling,</i>

601
01:05:47,114 --> 01:05:49,981
<i>the light pouring through
those big windows,</i>

602
01:05:51,051 --> 01:05:55,010
<i>the waxed hardwood floor</i>

603
01:05:56,290 --> 01:06:01,990
<i>You can hear shoes squeaking</i>

604
01:06:04,265 --> 01:06:06,358
<i>Get up on the stage</i>

605
01:06:08,102 --> 01:06:10,070
<i>Graduation Ceremony</i>

606
01:06:10,971 --> 01:06:16,637
<i>"Farewell for today"</i>

607
01:06:16,744 --> 01:06:22,410
<i>"Until we meet again"</i>

608
01:06:23,851 --> 01:06:25,876
<i>I like this song</i>

609
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:32,285
<i>Stand in front of the piano</i>

610
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,500
<i>Close your eyes</i>

611
01:06:44,738 --> 01:06:46,262
<i>Are they closed?</i>

612
01:06:47,174 --> 01:06:48,505
<i>Ready?</i>

613
01:06:48,609 --> 01:06:51,874
<i>You can't open them
until I tell you to</i>

614
01:06:55,316 --> 01:06:56,874
Don't open them

615
01:06:59,653 --> 01:07:01,120
Aki

616
01:07:04,825 --> 01:07:06,793
Keep your eyes closed, OK?

617
01:07:08,162 --> 01:07:12,690
I haven't played since I was little,
so I'm not sure how well I'll do

618
01:07:13,734 --> 01:07:16,430
I've never played for anyone

619
01:07:17,471 --> 01:07:19,439
This is a very big deal

620
01:10:25,092 --> 01:10:26,821
I love you

621
01:10:36,303 --> 01:10:38,328
I love you, Saku

622
01:11:07,968 --> 01:11:09,196
Say

623
01:11:10,204 --> 01:11:11,432
Yeah?

624
01:11:13,207 --> 01:11:15,402
How do you meet,

625
01:11:17,511 --> 01:11:20,207
when you meet by chance?

626
01:11:26,987 --> 01:11:28,818
Leukemia

627
01:11:33,527 --> 01:11:35,722
The name of my disease

628
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:44,798
Leukemia

629
01:11:54,781 --> 01:12:00,048
You got it because of that awful
postcard I sent to the radio show

630
01:12:00,153 --> 01:12:01,177
That's not true

631
01:12:01,288 --> 01:12:02,755
But no!

632
01:12:11,665 --> 01:12:13,428
It's my destiny

633
01:12:20,307 --> 01:12:24,266
But I swear not to die

634
01:12:25,879 --> 01:12:28,177
I need you to believe it, too

635
01:12:36,757 --> 01:12:38,486
Believe it

636
01:12:47,467 --> 01:12:49,094
Thank you

637
01:13:56,737 --> 01:13:59,433
<i>Oh, hello, it's me</i>

638
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,665
Did you find Ritsuko?

639
01:14:02,809 --> 01:14:04,709
<i>Not... yet</i>

640
01:14:05,412 --> 01:14:06,845
I see

641
01:14:07,347 --> 01:14:08,575
<i>Listen, Ryu</i>

642
01:14:11,985 --> 01:14:14,954
<i>Do you remember much
from high school?</i>

643
01:14:15,655 --> 01:14:17,714
That's kind of sudden

644
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:22,192
I can't believe I've forgotten

645
01:14:23,697 --> 01:14:26,291
So full of precious experiences

646
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:29,097
<i>What's up with you?</i>

647
01:14:35,642 --> 01:14:37,132
I just...

648
01:14:45,385 --> 01:14:47,376
I saw Aki

649
01:14:49,356 --> 01:14:51,881
<i>What are you talking about?
Get it together</i>

650
01:14:51,992 --> 01:14:54,552
<i>What'd you go there for?</i>

651
01:14:55,862 --> 01:14:58,695
<i>You went to find Ritsuko, right?</i>

652
01:14:59,499 --> 01:15:01,626
<i>Remembering Aki won't help</i>

653
01:15:01,735 --> 01:15:03,703
She's not a memory!

654
01:15:04,404 --> 01:15:06,031
That day, 17 years ago,

655
01:15:06,139 --> 01:15:09,472
after Typhoon #29 passed,
Aki died alone

656
01:15:11,311 --> 01:15:12,676
Aki didn't...

657
01:15:18,685 --> 01:15:21,620
Aki didn't want to see me
at the end

658
01:15:26,359 --> 01:15:27,587
That's why,

659
01:15:28,261 --> 01:15:31,287
being here, I feel like
Aki's still alive

660
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,518
Have some coffee

661
01:17:08,628 --> 01:17:10,186
Warm you right up

662
01:17:11,364 --> 01:17:13,298
Thank you so much

663
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:19,830
You know them?

664
01:17:25,011 --> 01:17:27,707
I owe so much to those kids

665
01:17:30,283 --> 01:17:34,049
The girl died right after
I took that picture

666
01:17:36,823 --> 01:17:39,690
Said she was afraid
of being forgotten

667
01:17:40,493 --> 01:17:42,085
So I took their picture

668
01:17:53,239 --> 01:17:54,797
I...

669
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:59,074
Stole it away

670
01:18:06,052 --> 01:18:08,077
The promise they'd made...

671
01:18:10,624 --> 01:18:12,854
I stole it away

672
01:19:03,543 --> 01:19:05,238
They're ready

673
01:19:06,646 --> 01:19:10,844
The film was pretty old,
but the pictures were fine

674
01:19:15,622 --> 01:19:17,487
Where is this?

675
01:19:18,825 --> 01:19:20,816
Probably Australia

676
01:19:21,394 --> 01:19:23,123
Ever been there?

677
01:19:24,097 --> 01:19:25,291
Nope

678
01:19:30,804 --> 01:19:32,237

Hey there, Ritsuko, don't run

680
01:19:45,752 --> 01:19:48,653
Aki, sister, the pictures are ready

681
01:19:48,822 --> 01:19:52,485
Really! Thanks

682
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:07,797
Amazing, right?

683
01:20:09,109 --> 01:20:11,270
Amazing

684
01:20:14,481 --> 01:20:15,675
Amazing!

I'm sorry she's always
pestering you

688

Oh, no, she's been

689
01:20:33,933 --> 01:20:35,127
Right?

690

at the crack of dawn

713

I'm sorry, sorry

714

Who delivers your tapes?

Who knows

717
01:22:43,229 --> 01:22:46,926
No fair. It bugs me

718
01:22:47,267 --> 01:22:49,735
Say, how's school?

719
01:22:50,370 --> 01:22:51,997
The culture festival's over

720
01:22:52,105 --> 01:22:55,336
The play was horrific

721
01:22:55,441 --> 01:22:57,170
Besides, you weren't there

722
01:22:57,310 --> 01:23:00,336
Huh, I see

723
01:23:03,716 --> 01:23:07,652
In here, you lose all sense of time

724

Don't talk like that

Pictures from the undeveloped
film on Yume Island

730
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:35,711
Look at what was there

731
01:23:36,549 --> 01:23:37,573
Where is this?

732
01:23:37,684 --> 01:23:39,447
Australia, they say

733
01:23:41,521 --> 01:23:44,012
This is called Uluru

734
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:47,854
Uluru is a place,

735
01:23:48,728 --> 01:23:50,389
that's sacred

736
01:23:50,496 --> 01:23:55,399
among the Aborigines,
Australian tribal people

737
01:23:55,501 --> 01:23:57,128
They consider it holy

738
01:24:00,773 --> 01:24:02,331
So sacred,

739
01:24:02,976 --> 01:24:06,571
that even for me,
it's the center of the world

740
01:24:10,149 --> 01:24:12,117
The center of the world?

741
01:24:13,286 --> 01:24:14,514
That's right

742

You take these balls and put
them all in your left hand

752
01:25:28,928 --> 01:25:33,627
You mash them together,
with both hands...

753
01:25:35,868 --> 01:25:39,599
Hey, Saku
Don't scare me

754
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:41,873
What's all this?

755
01:25:41,974 --> 01:25:46,468

Can you come have
your picture taken?

What?

762
01:26:05,698 --> 01:26:08,166
Don't worry, Uncle Shige's place
is close

763

Dr. Sudo was looking for you

771
01:26:39,866 --> 01:26:41,731
Oh, shoot

772
01:26:41,834 --> 01:26:44,064
I forgot I had afternoon tests

773
01:26:45,037 --> 01:26:48,234
Saku, can you wait?

774
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:53,371
You're not getting
any better at that

775
01:26:53,779 --> 01:26:56,475
I practice a lot, you know

776
01:26:58,017 --> 01:26:59,985
Sorry I made you wait

777
01:27:00,086 --> 01:27:00,916
Everything OK?

778
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:04,979
Yeah, if they find out,
Kawano will cover for me

779
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:11,127
What's with this "Kawano this"
and "Kawano that"?

780
01:27:15,701 --> 01:27:17,168
What?

781

Don't tell me you're jealous

782
01:27:24,243 --> 01:27:26,438

All right

786
01:28:02,848 --> 01:28:04,748
Will the pictures
be ready tomorrow?

787
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:06,044
Yeah

788
01:28:06,419 --> 01:28:08,785
They're for our passports,

02:05:53,617 --> 02:05:57,644
it was because of you that
Aki and I discovered each other

1005
02:06:12,903 --> 02:06:14,393
That day...

1006
02:06:17,975 --> 02:06:22,469
she only made it this far

1007
02:06:28,552 --> 02:06:29,985
Someday...

1008
02:06:32,789 --> 02:06:35,451
I promised her we'd get there

1009
02:06:50,674 --> 02:06:52,767
Time to tie up loose ends

1010
02:07:48,565 --> 02:07:49,827
Uluru

1011
02:09:58,195 --> 02:10:00,254
<i>When I close my eyes,</i>

1012
02:10:01,431 --> 02:10:04,889
<i>I only see your face</i>

1013
02:10:08,004 --> 02:10:10,165
<i>What I remember,</i>

1014
02:10:11,141 --> 02:10:14,804
<i>is your big mouth full
of fried noodle bread,</i>

1015
02:10:15,679 --> 02:10:19,206
<i>and your face,
crumpled up with laughter</i>

1016
02:10:21,384 --> 02:10:24,046
<i>You puffed it up earnestly,</i>

1017
02:10:24,354 --> 02:10:28,484
<i>then suddenly shifted and
softened with a kind smile</i>

1018
02:10:32,763 --> 02:10:35,698
<i>Your sleeping face on Yume Island</i>

1019
02:10:38,602 --> 02:10:42,595
<i>I wish it was near enough
to touch, now</i>

1020
02:10:47,210 --> 02:10:49,906
<i>When you gave me a ride
on your bike,</i>

1021
02:10:50,013 --> 02:10:53,073
<i>the warmth of your back,</i>

1022
02:10:53,350 --> 02:10:56,046
<i>meant the world to me</i>

1023
02:11:00,023 --> 02:11:03,322
<i>All the memories of time
I spent with you,</i>

1024
02:11:04,194 --> 02:11:07,789
<i>made my life sparkle</i>

1025
02:11:12,402 --> 02:11:15,894
<i>Thank you so much
for being with me</i>

1026
02:11:18,809 --> 02:11:20,709
<i>I'll never forget</i>

1027
02:11:24,314 --> 02:11:27,613
<i>the precious time I spent with you</i>

1028
02:11:34,090 --> 02:11:37,491
<i>I just have one last request</i>

1029
02:11:39,696 --> 02:11:42,028
<i>Please scatter my ashes</i>

1030
02:11:42,833 --> 02:11:46,325
<i>on the winds of Uluru</i>

1031
02:11:47,637 --> 02:11:49,298
<i>And then,</i>

1032
02:11:49,806 --> 02:11:54,072
<i>go on and live your life</i>

1033
02:11:58,315 --> 02:12:01,011
<i>I'm so glad I met you</i>

1034
02:12:04,521 --> 02:12:06,113
<i>Bye bye</i>

1035
02:12:58,508 --> 02:13:00,169
Coming here,

1036
02:13:03,580 --> 02:13:07,016
I feel like I've found
the center of the world

1037
02:14:13,283 --> 02:14:15,251
Like magic

1038
02:14:16,987 --> 02:14:19,182
Just like Aki...

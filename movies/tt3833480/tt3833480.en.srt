3
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:59,645
It's so goddamn
black out there.

4
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:02,447
Pilots won't come here
unless there's red illum.

5
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:04,282
No moonlight.

6
00:02:04,316 --> 00:02:07,619
Alisa was really freaked when
I told her I was coming here.

7
00:02:07,653 --> 00:02:10,355
Do yourself a favor, man.
Don't call home.

8
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,458
Like Sergeant Romesha.

9
00:02:13,492 --> 00:02:15,427
Fucks with his head too much
to call home, right, Ro?

10
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:20,800
I'll call home when I'm on
a bird out of this valley.

11
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,335
Until then, don't think
about your wives.

12
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,881
Goddamn it, fuck.

13
00:02:36,048 --> 00:02:38,450
Sir, sir.

14
00:02:40,552 --> 00:02:42,822
Is he fucking
smoking hash again?

15
00:02:42,855 --> 00:02:44,690
Come on, Faulkner,
for fuck's sake.

16
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:46,893
<i>Black night
X-ray, this is Husky 2.</i>

17
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:48,661
<i>We're one minute
from bringing the boys in</i>

18
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:49,929
<i>and deliver the blow.</i>

19
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,030
Roger, that Husky 2.

20
00:02:51,063 --> 00:02:53,666
This is X-ray.
Thanks for making our troop whole.

21
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:07,412
Unload from the right.

22
00:03:07,445 --> 00:03:09,381
Home, sweet home, warriors.

23
00:03:09,414 --> 00:03:10,482
All right, Sergeant.

24
00:03:12,118 --> 00:03:14,319
Holy shit, guys, we're here.

25
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:18,557
Hey, how you doing, guys?

26
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,627
- Captain!
- How you doing, sir?

27
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:24,496
Welcome to the dark side
of the moon, gentlemen.

28
00:03:24,529 --> 00:03:25,430
Delighted, sir.

29
00:03:25,463 --> 00:03:27,900
Jesus, Yunger, get
your fucking head down.

30
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:30,602
Carter?

31
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,873
I'll get the supplies, sir.

32
00:03:37,576 --> 00:03:39,946
All right, real men
have arrived!

33
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:41,479
Let's introduce some hot dollar.

34
00:03:42,815 --> 00:03:44,549
You guys are late
to the party, man.

35
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,751
Got my fucking bunk ready?

36
00:03:45,785 --> 00:03:47,787
Hey, new guys,
bunks with the folded blankets are open.

37
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,921
Make yourselves at home.

38
00:03:48,955 --> 00:03:50,656
Hey,
you fucking pussies.

39
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,924
Where am I bunking, cowgirl?

40
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,694
I won't ask,
if you won't tell.

41
00:03:54,727 --> 00:03:55,728
Ah, shit.

42
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:57,697
Picking up tricks from
the locals, I see, huh?

43
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,531
- Good to see you, man.
- Good to see you, bud.

44
00:03:59,564 --> 00:04:01,868
God, you smell like
a bag of dicks.

45
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:03,903
Well, I thought that
was the musk you like.

46
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:07,673
Hey, not that one, Cherry.
That's Libert's.

47
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:09,909
- Find a different bunk.
- Who's Libert?

48
00:04:09,942 --> 00:04:11,177
What the fuck, man.

49
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,012
Hey, show some
respect, goddamn it.

50
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,180
Who's Libert?

51
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:15,882
Fuck you is who he is.

52
00:04:15,915 --> 00:04:18,516
Put that down.
Go grab your bunk right there.

53
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,652
Grab your goddamn bunk, man.

54
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:21,020
Hey, nice to meet
you, too, Sergeant.

55
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,587
There's no way
I'm going underneath you

56
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:24,757
unless it's fucking
made out of titanium.

57
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,125
- You understand?
- Keep talking.

58
00:04:26,158 --> 00:04:27,592
I'm gonna kick
that fucking ass, man.

59
00:04:27,627 --> 00:04:29,494
You don't know what
muscle looks like, boy.

60
00:04:29,527 --> 00:04:31,831
Yeah, fuck you, too.
Come here, man.

61
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:32,965
Give me a fucking hug.

62
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:35,134
Hey, you can't move
the castle diagonally.

63
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:38,403
I'm your superior.
I can move it however the fuck I like.

64
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:42,875
That's what I'm saying.
I don't think I would stand a chance.

65
00:04:45,945 --> 00:04:47,512
At least we have a garden.

66
00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:50,582
- A real Garden of Eden.
- Gotta be shitting me.

67
00:04:50,615 --> 00:04:52,118
Look at this place.

68
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:54,552
Yeah, the Taliban have a
nice fucking view of us, don't they?

69
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,626
- Fuck me, man.
- Fucking retarded, I know.

70
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,528
They usually come up
that draw, on the back side,

71
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:07,767
take a few fucking shots, and then
just, like, get the hell out.

72
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,502
Aren't we supposed to be on
top of the mountain to win this thing?

73
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:11,837
Don't be logical, Scusa.

74
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:13,505
Yeah, let's get moving.

75
00:05:16,642 --> 00:05:17,810
This is a joke, right?

76
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:19,979
Not funny ha ha.

77
00:05:20,012 --> 00:05:21,613
It's more like a black comedy.

78
00:05:21,647 --> 00:05:24,083
Shit. I love getting fucked
in this shit bowl.

79
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,583
Man, we're not fucked.

80
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,753
Maybe this place is like
an opportunity, you know?

81
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:29,621
Yeah, how do we protect
this piece of shit?

82
00:05:29,655 --> 00:05:30,890
Better question
would be, "Why?"

83
00:05:30,923 --> 00:05:32,124
What do you mean, boys?

84
00:05:32,158 --> 00:05:33,993
Like they say,
freedom ain't free.

85
00:05:34,026 --> 00:05:36,729
- Tighten this motherfucker.
- Sitting fucking ducks.

86
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:38,764
- Good morning.
- Hey there, Martin.

87
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:40,833
- Hello, brother Martin.
- Well, hello.

88
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:42,134
Must be the honkies.

89
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:43,869
Heard someone talking
about freedom.

90
00:05:43,903 --> 00:05:45,871
Speaking of a black comedy...

91
00:05:45,905 --> 00:05:48,808
- Already at it, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

92
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:51,210
Working on a beast,
this big motherfucker right here.

93
00:05:51,243 --> 00:05:52,311
How'd it get out here?

94
00:05:52,345 --> 00:05:55,513
Some colonel in Jalalabad
had something to prove.

95
00:05:55,547 --> 00:05:56,916
Brought this big
motherfucker over here

96
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:59,151
through these shitty-ass roads.

97
00:05:59,185 --> 00:06:01,153
Yeah, risked life and limb,
but just not his own.

98
00:06:01,187 --> 00:06:02,554
Fucking officers.

99
00:06:02,587 --> 00:06:03,856
Yeah, heard that story before.

100
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:06,524
Yeah, it's the Tali's
favorite target.

101
00:06:06,558 --> 00:06:08,661
They take at least
one shot at it every day.

102
00:06:11,697 --> 00:06:13,666
Hey, leave that dog alone!

103
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:16,669
What the fuck you doing?

104
00:06:16,702 --> 00:06:18,004
Hey, hey, it's okay.

105
00:06:18,037 --> 00:06:20,139
What the fuck was that?

106
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,641
The dog, it has, uh, fleas.

107
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:24,243
Yeah, we all have
fucking fleas.

108
00:06:24,276 --> 00:06:26,245
It doesn't mean you gotta fucking kill it, motherfucker!

109
00:06:32,752 --> 00:06:33,953
Field to Red Dragon,
contact.

110
00:06:33,986 --> 00:06:35,921
Taliban's firing
from the Olive Garden!

111
00:06:35,955 --> 00:06:37,156
Got it!

112
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:44,596
I see 'em, man. I see 'em.

113
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,564
- Fuck.
- Whoo-hoo!

114
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,068
Come on, you motherfuckers!

115
00:06:50,102 --> 00:06:51,170
Asshole!

116
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,838
Fucking watch it,
fucking Yunger!

117
00:06:56,842 --> 00:06:57,777
What do we got?

118
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,879
Sir, we've got RPGs
from the Olive Garden

119
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:01,313
and a fuck load of rifle fire.

120
00:07:02,848 --> 00:07:04,316
Damn.

121
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,885
Bundy won again, huh?

122
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:07,787
- I'm fucking out, Ro.
- What?

123
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,055
Ugh, I only brought
my starter belt!

124
00:07:09,088 --> 00:07:11,057
Mace, Mace, we need more 240!

125
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,025
Give me
that 2-fucking-40, Mace!

126
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:15,694
This is LRAS 2,
we need more ammo. Over!

127
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:17,863
Let's show 'em some
love with the 1-20s.

128
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:18,931
Willie and Pete.

129
00:07:18,964 --> 00:07:20,966
Carter!

130
00:07:25,004 --> 00:07:26,739
Can I help you, Carter?

131
00:07:26,772 --> 00:07:28,274
What the fuck you doing
with my 240?

132
00:07:28,307 --> 00:07:31,210
- What the fuck you mean?
- Where the fuck is my 240 ammo, man?

133
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,312
Mace said LRAS 2,
which is a 50 cal...

134
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:34,947
Bullshit. I said 240!

135
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,082
Go get my fucking ammo, man!

136
00:07:36,115 --> 00:07:37,817
- Well, then why didn't you say...
- I fucking did!

137
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,353
Stop talking, and go get
the right ammo. Go, go!

138
00:07:41,387 --> 00:07:43,789
- Fucking Carter.
- Fuck me, do your fucking job!

139
00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:44,857
Mortars, this is X-ray.

140
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,026
CO wants you to put some
1-20s in the Olive Garden.

141
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:49,361
I'll say again, 1-20s
in the Olive Garden. Over.

142
00:07:49,395 --> 00:07:50,963
Thomson, we got
Olive Garden, baby.

143
00:07:50,996 --> 00:07:52,031
Here we fucking go again!

144
00:07:52,064 --> 00:07:53,799
Let's light these
motherfuckers up!

145
00:07:58,104 --> 00:07:59,905
Whoa, cease fire.

146
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:02,074
Mace, cease fire!

147
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:03,309
- We got 'em.
- Whoo!

148
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:05,678
- Good job, fellas.
- Oh, he gone.

149
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:07,780
- Hey, baby!
- Well, that really blew some minds.

150
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:09,281
Damn,
that's cold, bro.

151
00:08:09,315 --> 00:08:12,184
- Too soon?
- Mortaritaville saves the day again.

152
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:13,686
This is Red 2.

153
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:15,354
End of mission.
Target destroyed.

154
00:08:15,387 --> 00:08:18,824
Thank you for your service,
D-Rod and Thomson.

155
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:22,161
Oh, man, that was
the shit, man. I got it all.

156
00:08:22,194 --> 00:08:23,996
- You wait till you see this footage, boys.
- Yunger.

157
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:26,699
Yunger, you dick!

158
00:08:26,732 --> 00:08:28,134
Uh-oh.

159
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:31,203
- Welcome home, Cherry.
- You listen to me, Yunger.

160
00:08:31,237 --> 00:08:34,106
You ever a fucking fire a weapon
at me that close again,

161
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,041
and I'll fucking
kill you myself.

162
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:37,943
- Gallegos, stop.
- Fucking understand me?

163
00:08:37,977 --> 00:08:40,246
- Gallegos!
- Fuck you, Yunger.

164
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:43,883
- You okay, Yunger?
- I'm fine.

165
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,719
- You good, man?
- Goddamn Cherry shoots over my fucking head.

166
00:08:46,752 --> 00:08:48,120
- Hey, Yunger.
- All right, guys.

167
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:49,688
What? He could
have fucking killed me!

168
00:08:49,722 --> 00:08:50,890
Get up, get up.

169
00:08:52,424 --> 00:08:53,959
What? Are
you his mother now, Ro?

170
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:55,361
We all learn lessons out here.

171
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:56,896
- Leave that fucker in the dirt.
- You're doing good, kid.

172
00:08:56,929 --> 00:08:58,430
I'm cool,
Sergeant. I'm cool.

173
00:08:58,464 --> 00:08:59,765
You're cool, Yunger.

174
00:08:59,798 --> 00:09:00,933
Ah,
check it out, Mace.

175
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:03,035
Here comes my fucking 240 ammo.

176
00:09:03,068 --> 00:09:04,136
Typical Carter.

177
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,038
- What a fucking day.
- Is that it?

178
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,709
Is that all?

179
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:15,214
You can't argue and fight
at the same time.

180
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:18,484
- What?
- You can't argue and fight at the same time.

181
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:19,785
Don't do it again.

182
00:09:22,087 --> 00:09:23,088
Go on.

183
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:27,293
Whatever.

184
00:09:27,326 --> 00:09:28,727
It's not gonna work that way.

185
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:29,762
Get back here.

186
00:09:36,268 --> 00:09:37,336
Go to parade rest.

187
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:44,210
Repeat after me.

188
00:09:44,243 --> 00:09:46,845
"I will not argue and fight
at the same time."

189
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,882
I will not argue and fight
at the same time.

190
00:09:49,915 --> 00:09:51,116
Sound off this time.

191
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,384
I will not argue.

192
00:09:52,418 --> 00:09:54,086
- Sound off!
- I will not argue...

193
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:55,921
Let's not ruin a beautiful
morning, gentlemen.

194
00:09:55,955 --> 00:09:57,256
...and fight...

195
00:09:57,289 --> 00:09:58,490
- Thank you for your service.
- Thank you for your service.

196
00:09:58,524 --> 00:10:00,526
- ...at the same time.
- Medic needs a fucking litter!

197
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,995
- Aw, fuck!
- Fucking move!

198
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:05,164
You're gonna be okay, man.
You're gonna be okay.

199
00:10:05,197 --> 00:10:06,899
Jacobs, come on.

200
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:08,200
Stay with us, pal.

201
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:09,268
Doc, what you need?

202
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:10,169
Just keep everyone back.

203
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:11,437
Jacobs,
you're gonna be all right.

204
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,806
I'm gonna need
a fucking litter!

205
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,774
I lost two of my brothers
back home,

206
00:10:15,808 --> 00:10:17,276
fucking gang banging.

207
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:19,111
They looked just fucking like that.

208
00:10:21,046 --> 00:10:22,514
I told you this place
is a shithole.

209
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:24,950
Yeah. Well, it's ours now.

210
00:10:24,984 --> 00:10:26,085
I'm coming, I'm coming.

211
00:10:26,118 --> 00:10:28,220
- Jesus, what the fuck happened?
- The motherfuckers.

212
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:29,388
All right, what do you need?

213
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:31,857
That's it, this way.

214
00:10:35,861 --> 00:10:36,962
It's all you, Larson.

215
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:39,498
My bad.

216
00:10:39,531 --> 00:10:42,001
<i>Jacobs
got out of surgery okay.</i>

217
00:10:42,034 --> 00:10:44,236
<i>They even say he's gonna
fucking come back here.</i>

218
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,139
<i>Holy shit, man.
The guy lost half his fucking face.</i>

219
00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:49,508
- <i>Out.</i>
- That's fucking unbelievable.

220
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,278
There's no way I thought he'd be
back out here after that shit.

221
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:54,480
Jacobs is a squared
away dude, man.

222
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:56,448
Squared away ain't got nothing
to do with it, ham balls.

223
00:10:56,482 --> 00:10:57,983
You're a cherry.
You're a private.

224
00:10:58,017 --> 00:10:59,852
You don't know.
Fenty was squared away.

225
00:10:59,885 --> 00:11:01,220
Fritchy was squared away.

226
00:11:01,253 --> 00:11:04,023
- Snail.
- Who's Snail?

227
00:11:04,056 --> 00:11:06,859
Snail was one of the best
soldiers we knew.

228
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:09,962
And just like that, he was shot in
the face in Iraq, out of nowhere.

229
00:11:09,995 --> 00:11:11,497
Yeah.

230
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,265
Doesn't matter what
kind of soldier you are.

231
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:17,002
Good, bad.

232
00:11:17,036 --> 00:11:20,939
As far as I'm concerned,
we all stay alive out here, we win.

233
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:24,109
You guys got any extra
charges for the shitters?

234
00:11:24,143 --> 00:11:26,078
By the wack shack, man.
There's an ammo can full of 'em.

235
00:11:26,111 --> 00:11:27,946
Take 'em all.

236
00:11:30,883 --> 00:11:32,851
Jesus, call to prayer.

237
00:11:32,885 --> 00:11:34,253
Five times a fucking day, man.

238
00:11:34,286 --> 00:11:36,855
Ro, you in or you out?

239
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:38,991
- I'll play for him.
- I'll take two.

240
00:11:39,024 --> 00:11:40,893
Sit here,
look through these cards.

241
00:11:47,634 --> 00:11:49,435
Smoking hash isn't the answer.

242
00:11:50,602 --> 00:11:52,538
There's only 54 of us.
That's it.

243
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:54,073
And we all count on each other.

244
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:58,510
You being high out there
endangers all of us.

245
00:11:58,544 --> 00:12:01,347
It's not gonna
happen again, sir.

246
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,116
You're not the only one who came
here with substance abuse issues.

247
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:07,486
But you're the only one
who persists.

248
00:12:08,954 --> 00:12:10,089
I should kick you out of here...

249
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:12,057
- I don't have a substance abuse issue.
- Yes, you do.

250
00:12:12,991 --> 00:12:14,059
You do.

251
00:12:14,993 --> 00:12:16,161
Mmm-hmm.

252
00:12:18,597 --> 00:12:21,967
I'm busting you down to private, and you're
burning shit till I tell you to stop.

253
00:12:26,338 --> 00:12:27,506
One more chance, okay?

254
00:12:29,007 --> 00:12:30,943
- Sir.
- You're dismissed.

255
00:12:31,644 --> 00:12:32,911
Thank you, sir.

256
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,147
Evening, sir.

257
00:12:37,249 --> 00:12:39,618
Maybe he should
forfeit some pay.

258
00:12:39,652 --> 00:12:41,587
Pay don't mean nothing
to these guys out here.

259
00:12:45,591 --> 00:12:48,227
You take away their free time,
it's like being in prison.

260
00:12:53,098 --> 00:12:54,266
Hi, guys.

261
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:56,969
Hey, hey, listen up.

262
00:12:58,003 --> 00:12:59,104
Hello!

263
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,142
- Is this thing working?
- Yes, sir.

264
00:13:03,175 --> 00:13:04,977
Loud and clear.

265
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,378
The army made it, nope.

266
00:13:07,714 --> 00:13:09,248
- This everybody?
- Yes, sir.

267
00:13:09,548 --> 00:13:10,549
Okay.

268
00:13:12,618 --> 00:13:13,686
Look,

269
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:17,356
we're making great
progress here in Kamdesh,

270
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:20,159
but we still got
a lot of work to do.

271
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:25,964
Our outpost is still
a target of insurgents,

272
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:28,233
- in case you hadn't noticed.
- Hmm, oh, right.

273
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:33,305
So how do we do
our jobs and stay safe?

274
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:38,510
We need to keep a good
relationship with the locals.

275
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:40,446
Hmm?

276
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:44,183
Respect keeps us safe.

277
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:48,320
So we'll call
for another <i>shura.</i>

278
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:52,424
The lead elders
in the valley will attend.

279
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,727
They will bring some of
the younger men with them.

280
00:13:56,528 --> 00:13:58,631
Probably some of those assholes
who've been shooting at us.

281
00:13:58,665 --> 00:13:59,699
That's right.

282
00:13:59,732 --> 00:14:01,133
You know they are.

283
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:07,640
I will continue to speak
softly in the valley,

284
00:14:07,674 --> 00:14:10,375
offering more projects
and handshakes.

285
00:14:13,713 --> 00:14:17,282
But on the other hand,
I will carry all of you

286
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:18,785
like a big fucking stick.

287
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:20,385
- Fuck, yeah, sir.
- Sir.

288
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:21,688
Only way this thing works.

289
00:14:21,721 --> 00:14:23,155
I'm afraid you don't
have a big enough stick.

290
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:25,190
That's right.

291
00:14:25,224 --> 00:14:26,225
All right.

292
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:30,395
With your shield or on it.

293
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:32,264
On our shields, sir.

294
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:33,432
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

295
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:34,466
Yes, sir.

296
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:36,568
<i>Salam alaikum.</i>

297
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:37,737
<i>Salam alaikum.</i>

298
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,238
<i>Salam alaikum.</i>

299
00:14:52,384 --> 00:14:53,552
Carter, Griffin.

300
00:14:54,586 --> 00:14:55,755
- Sir.
- Sir.

301
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,358
You boys are joining me.

302
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:06,365
- Sir, some of those dudes are armed.
- I noticed.

303
00:15:06,398 --> 00:15:08,233
Sir, there is a price
on your head.

304
00:15:09,468 --> 00:15:11,203
That's why you're joining me.

305
00:15:11,236 --> 00:15:13,171
Keep your alien
invader costumes on.

306
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:15,574
Fuck the cigarette.

307
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,376
Sorry, Dad.

308
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:30,355
He says,
"Why have you come here?"

309
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:36,461
He says, you haven't
been here for 40 years.

310
00:15:36,495 --> 00:15:37,830
No, no.

311
00:15:39,197 --> 00:15:40,232
That was the Russians.

312
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:43,235
We're American.

313
00:15:43,268 --> 00:15:44,336
American.

314
00:15:45,672 --> 00:15:47,674
They really not understand this
or they just fucking with me?

315
00:15:49,274 --> 00:15:50,877
Sir, it's 556.

316
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,110
It's one of our bullets.

317
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:57,583
Our job is to
separate the Taliban

318
00:15:57,616 --> 00:15:58,851
and the ordinary people.

319
00:16:00,152 --> 00:16:01,420
We do that, the ordinary people

320
00:16:01,453 --> 00:16:02,789
won't get caught
in the crossfire.

321
00:16:05,557 --> 00:16:08,293
I can give you
money, contracts,

322
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:14,199
projects, if you help.

323
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:23,843
You know what this means?

324
00:16:26,311 --> 00:16:28,180
This man fired
his rifle yesterday.

325
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:30,850
We were attacked yesterday.

326
00:16:32,885 --> 00:16:35,187
I must report
the attack on my outpost.

327
00:16:37,824 --> 00:16:39,591
I will lose honor

328
00:16:39,626 --> 00:16:41,426
with my elders.

329
00:16:43,428 --> 00:16:46,531
I can regain
my honor in two ways.

330
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:50,770
One way is for all of you
to lay down your arms...

331
00:16:52,672 --> 00:16:55,675
...and watch as your communities
flourish with the help

332
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,910
of the United States
and Allah.

333
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:04,951
And what is the other way?

334
00:17:07,285 --> 00:17:08,721
Why get into such ugliness?

335
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:15,828
And of course, the United
States will compensate anyone...

336
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:18,497
...who lays down their arms.

337
00:17:20,565 --> 00:17:22,935
Sir, these dudes shot at us yesterday.
You wanna let 'em go?

338
00:17:23,568 --> 00:17:25,237
Yes, I do.

339
00:18:05,845 --> 00:18:06,979
You are a good guest.

340
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,718
We will call you <i>"Amat."</i>

341
00:18:15,688 --> 00:18:17,222
"Highly praised one."

342
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,563
- I love you.
- I love you.

343
00:18:25,965 --> 00:18:27,834
- I love you.
- I love you!

344
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:30,302
- I love you.
- If you don't say it like you mean it,

345
00:18:30,335 --> 00:18:32,337
- you'll be there all night.
- I love you!

346
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,538
- Louder!
- I love you!

347
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,808
Holy shit, mate. What the fuck?

348
00:18:41,013 --> 00:18:42,247
Fuck.

349
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:46,284
Doing this gives
you fucking cancer.

350
00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:48,721
Cancer?
You fucking serious?

351
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:51,389
Well, shit, who knows what
these assholes are shitting out.

352
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:53,993
Could you stop while I've got
my fucking face in it?

353
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:58,931
Shit detail is
the Agent Orange of today.

354
00:18:58,965 --> 00:19:00,565
Just stop talking, man.

355
00:19:01,968 --> 00:19:04,937
Doing should be against UCMJ.

356
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:07,305
This shit
gives you cancer.

357
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:09,608
Fucking kills you.

358
00:19:14,346 --> 00:19:15,380
What's so funny, Carter?

359
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:18,751
Hey, this ain't no fucking
laughing matter, man.

360
00:19:18,785 --> 00:19:22,922
That you think it's cancer
that's going to kill you.

361
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:24,556
Yeah, he fucking
got you there, Mace.

362
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:25,992
Good of you to
make it, Faulkner.

363
00:19:26,926 --> 00:19:28,694
What's that?

364
00:19:29,162 --> 00:19:30,529
Late as always.

365
00:19:32,031 --> 00:19:34,767
I was picking up charges
for Mortaritaville, asshole.

366
00:19:36,568 --> 00:19:38,805
Well, fucking done here, man.

367
00:19:38,838 --> 00:19:41,339
I've seen the pictures, bro.
She's a classy lady.

368
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:43,375
- They've been making the rounds.
- Classy?

369
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:47,379
What the fuck?
They're good, man. Shit.

370
00:19:47,412 --> 00:19:49,115
Look, fuck it, anyway.

371
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:51,083
I'm remarrying
the woman I divorced.

372
00:19:51,117 --> 00:19:53,085
And she's pregnant by
some other fucking dude.

373
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:55,620
Yeah, well, have fun
with that, buddy.

374
00:19:55,655 --> 00:19:57,422
Gonna raise the kid
like they're my own.

375
00:19:57,455 --> 00:19:58,858
- Great idea.
- Huh!

376
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:02,394
I never really took you for
the saint type there, Gallegos.

377
00:20:02,427 --> 00:20:03,796
Love is love, Hardt.

378
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,397
Love is fucking love.

379
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,833
I hear you.

380
00:20:06,866 --> 00:20:08,701
- There he is.
- Camel Lights, right?

381
00:20:09,401 --> 00:20:10,903
Thanks.

382
00:20:10,937 --> 00:20:12,604
These are not Camel Lights.

383
00:20:18,778 --> 00:20:22,715
Hey, Taliban motherfuckers!

384
00:20:22,748 --> 00:20:24,984
Not so tough without
night vision, huh?

385
00:20:27,954 --> 00:20:30,488
<i>♪ Party every day ♪</i>

386
00:20:34,459 --> 00:20:36,028
I love you.

387
00:20:36,062 --> 00:20:37,864
- Hey, Mace.
- Yes, Sergeant?

388
00:20:37,897 --> 00:20:40,498
Trying to wake up all
of fucking Nuristan here?

389
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,068
Sorry, Sergeant.

390
00:20:42,101 --> 00:20:43,870
You smell like dog shit, Mace.

391
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,838
Thank you, Sergeant.

392
00:20:45,872 --> 00:20:47,439
- I love you.
- I love you.

393
00:20:47,472 --> 00:20:49,675
- I love you.
- Love is in the air.

394
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:50,810
That's good.

395
00:20:53,012 --> 00:20:54,512
Oh, shit.

396
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:56,548
Goddamn, Mace.

397
00:20:56,581 --> 00:20:59,051
I picture you more of
like a name tag kind of guy.

398
00:20:59,085 --> 00:21:00,119
Like a waitress.

399
00:21:00,152 --> 00:21:02,655
I was a Home Depot salesman.

400
00:21:02,688 --> 00:21:04,891
Was that before or after you
got kicked out of the Marines?

401
00:21:04,924 --> 00:21:05,958
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

402
00:21:05,992 --> 00:21:08,460
I didn't get kicked out
of the Marines, Sergeant.

403
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:13,633
I got demoted for fighting.

404
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,936
I had a little bit of a temper
problem back then, so I got out.

405
00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:19,437
So you took your marine
skills to Home Depot?

406
00:21:19,471 --> 00:21:23,441
No, then I was
a cook at Denny's.

407
00:21:23,475 --> 00:21:25,978
I was a lumberjack,
projectionist at my local theater.

408
00:21:26,012 --> 00:21:29,181
And then I was a sales
associate at Home Depot,

409
00:21:29,215 --> 00:21:31,651
but only at Christmas
time, Sergeant.

410
00:21:31,684 --> 00:21:34,720
After that, I cleaned, helped
take care of the elderly,

411
00:21:34,754 --> 00:21:38,124
worked on cars for a
little while as a mechanic.

412
00:21:38,157 --> 00:21:40,893
Not certified, but still
a fucking mechanic.

413
00:21:40,927 --> 00:21:43,629
I was a barnacle sweeper for a small period of time.

414
00:21:43,663 --> 00:21:47,633
After that, I was lugging around
hot tubs to different houses,

415
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:49,902
but we call them
hot tub transporters.

416
00:21:49,936 --> 00:21:52,638
Then the Army took me.

417
00:21:52,672 --> 00:21:55,007
- I love you.
- You hearing this guy?

418
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,243
Remind me not to stand next to
him in the middle of a firefight.

419
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:59,946
- Excuse me, Sergeant?
- You heard me, Carter.

420
00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:04,016
Okay, we're gonna settle this Mini-Me and
Gary Coleman argument once and for all.

421
00:22:04,717 --> 00:22:07,720
And, uh,
no temper problem now?

422
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:11,523
Carter?

423
00:22:11,556 --> 00:22:13,659
Oh, I love you.

424
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,195
Touch glove, make love.

425
00:22:16,228 --> 00:22:18,230
Come on, boys!

426
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:23,535
You boys are real calm until you
get some shrapnel stuck in your ass.

427
00:22:23,568 --> 00:22:24,904
How much longer
is it gonna be?

428
00:22:24,937 --> 00:22:26,639
- Scusa, hurry up before my grandma dies, man.
- Hey, Scusa.

429
00:22:26,672 --> 00:22:27,740
Two minutes, man.

430
00:22:27,773 --> 00:22:28,908
Hugs and kisses
to the the missus.

431
00:22:28,941 --> 00:22:30,142
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

432
00:22:30,176 --> 00:22:31,744
- They love it. They love it.
- Hey, Scusa.

433
00:22:31,777 --> 00:22:34,246
Yo, I wanna see one of
your wife in costume, man.

434
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,881
Hey, you know what?

435
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:38,117
Jesus! fuck!

436
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,551
Hey, get to fucking cover.

437
00:22:39,584 --> 00:22:42,054
- Gallegos, take point.
- Tree top, tree top.

438
00:22:42,088 --> 00:22:43,255
Shit, shit, shit.

439
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,025
On me, on me!

440
00:22:47,893 --> 00:22:50,896
Where the fuck is he? Yunger?
This better be a fucking joke!

441
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,031
Sir?

442
00:22:52,064 --> 00:22:54,233
Give me that fucking photo,
you sick little fucker!

443
00:22:54,266 --> 00:22:56,102
- Get out here!
- You dirty bastard.

444
00:22:56,135 --> 00:22:58,204
Are you jerking off
to my fucking wife?

445
00:22:58,237 --> 00:22:59,972
Get the fuck out here!

446
00:23:00,006 --> 00:23:01,674
Are you fucking kidding me?

447
00:23:01,707 --> 00:23:04,043
- I'm sorry, okay? She's so pretty.
- Get the fuck down!

448
00:23:04,076 --> 00:23:06,779
Yunger, you were beating
your meat to his wife?

449
00:23:06,812 --> 00:23:08,613
Say you're fucking sorry.
Start pushing!

450
00:23:08,647 --> 00:23:10,649
I'm sorry, Olivia.
I'm sorry, Olivia.

451
00:23:10,683 --> 00:23:12,018
- Huh?
- I'm sorry.

452
00:23:12,051 --> 00:23:14,086
It's "Mrs. Hardt."

453
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,921
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hardt.

454
00:23:15,955 --> 00:23:18,090
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Ow!

455
00:23:18,124 --> 00:23:19,825
Loud and clear.

456
00:23:21,727 --> 00:23:23,996
- Loud and fucking clear.
- What's up, sir?

457
00:23:25,664 --> 00:23:28,868
Boss wants us to move that
damn LMTV back to Naray.

458
00:23:28,901 --> 00:23:30,202
Seriously? Why?

459
00:23:30,236 --> 00:23:31,603
I guess they need it.

460
00:23:31,637 --> 00:23:32,972
That's bullshit.

461
00:23:33,005 --> 00:23:36,075
Sir, that thing is way too big
to navigate these shit-ass roads.

462
00:23:36,108 --> 00:23:37,443
Well, it got here somehow.

463
00:23:37,476 --> 00:23:40,980
Everybody who brought that monster
over here was almost killed.

464
00:23:41,013 --> 00:23:42,748
The roads are too small.

465
00:23:42,782 --> 00:23:44,750
It's more dangerous
than the goddamn Taliban,

466
00:23:44,784 --> 00:23:46,152
especially after the rain, sir.

467
00:23:46,185 --> 00:23:48,254
You know, I'm close
with the CSM over there.

468
00:23:48,287 --> 00:23:50,022
I could reach out.

469
00:23:50,056 --> 00:23:53,692
Guys, brass gave us a mission.

470
00:23:53,726 --> 00:23:55,694
We're gonna deliver
like we always do.

471
00:23:56,962 --> 00:23:58,864
All right.

472
00:23:58,898 --> 00:24:00,966
Who are we gonna get
to drive it?

473
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,967
Sir, are you sure
you wouldn't rather

474
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:04,036
have one of the enlisted
men behind the wheel?

475
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,871
Can't always have
all the fun, Bundy.

476
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,709
You're in command now.

477
00:24:10,743 --> 00:24:14,380
Please, try not to invade
Pakistan or something.

478
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:15,881
I'll do my best, sir.

479
00:24:15,915 --> 00:24:17,283
Please be careful, sir.

480
00:24:19,885 --> 00:24:21,353
<i>Captain Keating, sir.</i>

481
00:24:21,387 --> 00:24:23,255
We're here, Red 5 Delta.
Go ahead.

482
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:24,690
Wanna make a little
room, Sergeant?

483
00:24:24,723 --> 00:24:26,292
<i>This is Red 5 Delta.</i>

484
00:24:26,325 --> 00:24:28,294
<i>Sir, I just had a thought.</i>

485
00:24:28,327 --> 00:24:30,930
<i>Shouldn't Gallegos
be driving the truck?</i>

486
00:24:30,963 --> 00:24:33,833
I mean, that's how he got his
whole family across the border.

487
00:24:33,866 --> 00:24:34,834
Over.

488
00:24:34,867 --> 00:24:36,802
<i>Oh, boy. Here it comes.</i>

489
00:24:36,836 --> 00:24:37,837
Bitch!

490
00:24:40,072 --> 00:24:42,842
I could fuck you
for that, white boy,

491
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:44,376
but your freaky ass
might fall in love.

492
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:06,765
It's gonna take 'em all night just
to travel 13 fucking miles, man.

493
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:08,901
Fucked up, sir.

494
00:25:08,934 --> 00:25:10,903
Yes, it is, Kirk.
Yes, it is fucked up.

495
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,052
Captain, the bees eat through
the sugar in just a few days.

496
00:25:27,086 --> 00:25:29,688
It's a time release
barrier, so the bees

497
00:25:29,722 --> 00:25:32,358
get used to the queen's
pheromones and don't kill her.

498
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:36,228
I wouldn't touch anybody else's
fucking honey except my own.

499
00:25:36,262 --> 00:25:38,697
And here I thought we'd run
out of things to talk about.

500
00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:44,036
Don't worry.
I got it, Sergeant.

501
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:46,338
- I trust you, sir.
- Just hug these walls.

502
00:25:46,372 --> 00:25:48,040
That's a good idea, sir.

503
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:52,144
Maybe it is time for
you to call home, Ro.

504
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,413
No, no.

505
00:25:54,446 --> 00:25:57,716
I call home,
and all I'll end up doing is lying.

506
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,918
What's the point in that?

507
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:03,322
How about you, sir?
You call home?

508
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:06,358
Parents and my fiance,
yeah, all the time.

509
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,827
What about you, Carter?

510
00:26:10,763 --> 00:26:12,765
Oh, nobody wants
to hear from me, sir.

511
00:26:14,233 --> 00:26:16,068
Oh, I doubt that's true.

512
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:18,204
You
don't know my ex-wife wife.

513
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:24,343
Look, I'm proud to be here.

514
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:27,379
I get it.

515
00:26:28,113 --> 00:26:30,182
I see it.

516
00:26:30,216 --> 00:26:33,185
We're gonna win by getting
their hearts and minds.

517
00:26:33,219 --> 00:26:35,254
Yeah, we want their
hearts and minds,

518
00:26:35,287 --> 00:26:37,323
and they want
our blood and guts, right?

519
00:26:37,356 --> 00:26:38,924
<i>Red 2, this is X-ray.</i>

520
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:40,859
<i>We got a reaper
on station in your vicinity</i>

521
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:43,429
<i>picking up an unknown
hotspot 200 meters ahead.</i>

522
00:26:43,462 --> 00:26:45,331
<i>Advise, proceed with caution.</i>

523
00:26:48,033 --> 00:26:49,969
I'll go check it out, sir.

524
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:57,876
What is that?

525
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:00,980
It looks... It's a chicken.

526
00:27:01,013 --> 00:27:02,915
A dead chicken.

527
00:27:02,948 --> 00:27:04,850
It's just a dead chicken.
Go on through.

528
00:27:09,455 --> 00:27:13,259
You know, Sergeant,
I used to be a Mormon, too.

529
00:27:13,292 --> 00:27:14,760
I was raised as one, anyways.

530
00:27:15,794 --> 00:27:17,830
I'm not sure that's gonna
make us friends, Carter.

531
00:27:21,567 --> 00:27:23,269
I don't need
friends, Sergeant.

532
00:27:23,836 --> 00:27:25,371
At least not these guys.

533
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:28,073
I got news for you.

534
00:27:28,107 --> 00:27:30,342
These guys are probably
the best you're ever gonna do.

535
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:33,879
Yeah, I don't, uh...

536
00:27:34,847 --> 00:27:37,082
I don't know about that.

537
00:27:37,116 --> 00:27:40,452
All this frat boy shit
and joking around,

538
00:27:40,486 --> 00:27:42,354
got their fucking
dicks in their hands,

539
00:27:43,255 --> 00:27:46,158
this is not the place
for it, Sergeant.

540
00:27:46,191 --> 00:27:48,227
Marines would never go
for what happens around here.

541
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,296
- You know that.
- Yeah, yeah, I remember.

542
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:51,597
- You're a Marine.
- Yeah.

543
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:54,333
Guys, what's the holdup, huh?

544
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:56,201
- Come on through.
- <i>What, man? I needed a leak.</i>

545
00:27:56,235 --> 00:27:58,337
Look, I'm sick
of your shit, okay?

546
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,239
You wanna know why
no one likes you?

547
00:28:00,272 --> 00:28:01,907
It's because you're
always the odd man out.

548
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,342
You're always
on the fucking sidelines.

549
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:06,979
Even if it is "frat boy
shit," Larson's right.

550
00:28:07,012 --> 00:28:08,814
Nobody knows
if they can trust you.

551
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,251
Come on. Move.

552
00:28:16,522 --> 00:28:17,589
Watch it, ladies.

553
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:19,591
Shit.

554
00:28:19,626 --> 00:28:21,927
Come on, Carter.

555
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,562
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm okay.

556
00:28:24,363 --> 00:28:26,198
Fuck!

557
00:28:26,231 --> 00:28:27,599
You know what, Sergeant?

558
00:28:27,634 --> 00:28:29,168
I don't care
if I'm a specialist.

559
00:28:29,968 --> 00:28:30,969
Fuck!

560
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:38,510
Oh, God.

561
00:28:42,414 --> 00:28:45,084
- <i>Guys, what the fuck was that, man?</i>
- Six is down.

562
00:28:45,117 --> 00:28:47,052
We need ropes and a litter ASAP.

563
00:28:47,086 --> 00:28:49,154
<i>We need immediate medevac.</i>

564
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:52,157
<i>Six is down.
The fucking LMTV came off a cliff.</i>

565
00:28:52,958 --> 00:28:54,426
<i>Fuck.</i>

566
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,729
<i>That's good copy.
Readings are all about now.</i>

567
00:28:55,762 --> 00:28:58,997
<i>Birds are about 40 mikes out.
Send me the land line. Over.</i>

568
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:18,250
Ready, aim, fire.

569
00:29:18,685 --> 00:29:21,153
Ready, aim, fire.

570
00:29:21,688 --> 00:29:24,056
Ready, aim, fire.

571
00:29:49,749 --> 00:29:52,151
God,
please watch over him

572
00:29:52,184 --> 00:29:55,020
and grant him passage
into the next life. Amen.

573
00:30:09,034 --> 00:30:10,335
All right, guys.

574
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:11,537
Back to work.

575
00:30:23,415 --> 00:30:26,351
I pledge allegiance
to your pussy.

576
00:30:26,385 --> 00:30:27,986
Time's almost up, Griff.

577
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,188
Specialist.

578
00:30:31,023 --> 00:30:33,058
Is that how mama taught
you how to wear panties?

579
00:30:33,091 --> 00:30:36,195
Griffin, this is your new
commander, Captain Yllescas.

580
00:30:37,196 --> 00:30:38,363
How are you doing, sir?

581
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:43,035
Sir, those were Maria Kirilenko's.
The tennis star.

582
00:30:43,068 --> 00:30:46,071
- She sent 'em as a gift, if you can believe that.
- Is that right?

583
00:30:46,104 --> 00:30:47,306
Ah, well, who needs
Toby Keith,

584
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:48,741
when you can
fucking sniff those.

585
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:51,009
Yeah, we're a little short on
recreation around here. Chris Cordova.

586
00:30:51,043 --> 00:30:52,211
- Hey, Rob Yllescas.
- Nice to meet you.

587
00:30:52,244 --> 00:30:54,546
- And this is Dr. Courville.
- Ah, good to meet you, sir.

588
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,515
Griffin, help him
with his bags.

589
00:30:56,548 --> 00:30:58,250
- Uh, yes, sir.
- Thanks.

590
00:31:00,653 --> 00:31:03,288
To ever think we were
enemies with the Russians.

591
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:05,090
I guess the guys come in
here a lot for these, huh?

592
00:31:05,123 --> 00:31:07,559
That and the working
internet, sometimes.

593
00:31:07,593 --> 00:31:08,728
What do you guys
deal with here mostly?

594
00:31:08,761 --> 00:31:10,763
Ah, it's mostly
aid to the locals.

595
00:31:10,797 --> 00:31:13,298
Gunshot wounds when the
assholes are firing at us.

596
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,168
You guys got a MASCAL plan?

597
00:31:16,201 --> 00:31:17,336
It's not fucking good.

598
00:31:17,369 --> 00:31:20,439
We got this room for two
and the cafe outside for two.

599
00:31:20,472 --> 00:31:21,741
We can't refrigerate blood.

600
00:31:21,774 --> 00:31:23,342
Once we drop the 9 line,
it's almost two hours before we get

601
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:25,310
any helos in here for medevacs.

602
00:31:26,746 --> 00:31:28,614
All right, what can I do?

603
00:31:28,648 --> 00:31:30,048
You can close this
damn place down.

604
00:31:30,449 --> 00:31:32,184
Amen to that.

605
00:31:32,217 --> 00:31:34,486
Over here are ANA troops.

606
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,723
In the back is our mortar pit.

607
00:31:36,756 --> 00:31:38,624
- Sir.
- Oh, Lakis.

608
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:40,526
He's our ANA trainer.

609
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,593
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

610
00:31:41,628 --> 00:31:43,830
I'm your, uh, coalition
force from Latvia, sir.

611
00:31:43,863 --> 00:31:46,265
Great. How are the ANA soldiers?

612
00:31:46,298 --> 00:31:48,066
Some of them are okay

613
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,269
when I can get them off
of their asses.

614
00:31:50,302 --> 00:31:53,372
The 6th Kandek don't have
the best reputation, sir.

615
00:31:53,405 --> 00:31:56,408
Hey, it's your chance to put
your leadership on display.

616
00:31:56,441 --> 00:31:57,710
Embrace the suck.

617
00:31:57,744 --> 00:31:59,712
Embarrass the suck?

618
00:31:59,746 --> 00:32:02,180
Like I was saying,
our mortar pit.

619
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:04,751
Those guys, Thomson,
Rodriguez, Breeding,

620
00:32:04,784 --> 00:32:06,418
they really save our asses, sir.

621
00:32:06,451 --> 00:32:08,420
- That so?
- Yeah.

622
00:32:08,453 --> 00:32:10,355
Yeah, it's all
numbers and angles.

623
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:13,091
The mortars are the only thing
that reach that ridge line.

624
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:14,560
Without 'em, we're fucked.

625
00:32:14,593 --> 00:32:16,395
- Hey, brother Ro.
- Oh, perfect.

626
00:32:16,428 --> 00:32:17,797
- Kirk.
- Yeah.

627
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,531
He's one of our best
team leaders, sir.

628
00:32:21,266 --> 00:32:22,467
Meet Captain Yllescas.

629
00:32:22,501 --> 00:32:23,803
- Nice to meet you.
- Sir.

630
00:32:23,836 --> 00:32:25,137
I wish we didn't
have to meet you.

631
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,438
I'll try to live up
to all that.

632
00:32:26,471 --> 00:32:27,807
Good to have you, sir.

633
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,575
Grab a fucking sponge.
Get my back.

634
00:32:29,608 --> 00:32:31,243
Yeah, fuck yourself.

635
00:32:31,811 --> 00:32:33,412
Over here is our mosque.

636
00:32:36,816 --> 00:32:38,718
Gunfire!

637
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:41,353
- Motherfuckers!
- Goddamn it, shit!

638
00:32:41,386 --> 00:32:42,655
Treetops!

639
00:32:42,689 --> 00:32:44,389
Right! Come right!

640
00:32:45,758 --> 00:32:47,459
Brace yourself, boys!

641
00:32:47,492 --> 00:32:48,493
Get em!

642
00:32:48,928 --> 00:32:50,128
Get em!

643
00:32:56,168 --> 00:32:57,302
Hey, what do you think?

644
00:32:58,638 --> 00:32:59,839
You think the new boss
is gonna make us

645
00:32:59,872 --> 00:33:02,709
do a fucking patrol every time
they take a pot shot at us?

646
00:33:02,742 --> 00:33:04,610
Never try to
understand the officer, Mace.

647
00:33:04,644 --> 00:33:06,378
A different breed.

648
00:33:06,411 --> 00:33:07,613
They even fuck
with the lights on.

649
00:33:07,647 --> 00:33:09,716
Goddamn it, quit
your bitching, man.

650
00:33:09,749 --> 00:33:11,116
This ain't so bad.

651
00:33:12,351 --> 00:33:14,386
Fucking nature walk
with God, right, boys?

652
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:16,756
If God was real,
then these guys

653
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:18,825
wouldn't be trying to
kill us every goddamn day

654
00:33:18,858 --> 00:33:20,359
and Keating would
still be around here.

655
00:33:20,392 --> 00:33:22,160
God works in mysterious
ways, Sergeant.

656
00:33:22,194 --> 00:33:25,564
Yeah, so I guess God's plan
is our chaos, then, huh?

657
00:33:25,597 --> 00:33:27,232
Jesus fucking Christ, man.

658
00:33:27,265 --> 00:33:29,234
What you looking at, Sergeant?

659
00:33:29,267 --> 00:33:30,770
Seeing what they see.

660
00:33:30,803 --> 00:33:31,871
What's that, Ro?

661
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:35,507
Dead Americans.

662
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,476
Goddamn, you're a fucking
buzzkill, man.

663
00:33:39,478 --> 00:33:41,446
Every time they take
a pot shot at us,

664
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,315
they're figuring us out.

665
00:33:43,348 --> 00:33:44,483
When the big one comes,

666
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:46,719
they'll have us dialed in.

667
00:33:46,753 --> 00:33:48,487
And how would do it,
if you were them?

668
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,922
What?

669
00:33:49,956 --> 00:33:51,556
How would you do it,
if you were them?

670
00:33:53,525 --> 00:33:54,861
How would I do it?

671
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:00,232
Well, first I'd knock
out our mortar pit.

672
00:34:00,265 --> 00:34:02,234
Without that, we're fucked.

673
00:34:02,267 --> 00:34:04,269
Then I'd start hammering
our stand-to trucks,

674
00:34:04,302 --> 00:34:07,439
armored Humvees,
especially LRAS 2.

675
00:34:07,472 --> 00:34:09,241
That protects our mortars.

676
00:34:09,274 --> 00:34:12,244
Take out our ammo depot,
so we can't resupply.

677
00:34:13,913 --> 00:34:15,514
And then
I'd hit our generator,

678
00:34:16,783 --> 00:34:18,383
effectively kill our comms.

679
00:34:21,486 --> 00:34:24,623
And then I'd start sending
fighters on the switchbacks.

680
00:34:24,657 --> 00:34:27,860
It'd be a race to get inside
the wire before air support.

681
00:34:27,894 --> 00:34:29,996
Yeah, but even then
it's gonna take a few hours.

682
00:34:30,029 --> 00:34:32,464
The B1s come
all the way from fucking Qatar.

683
00:34:32,497 --> 00:34:34,399
Yeah, that's right, Carter.

684
00:34:34,433 --> 00:34:36,969
Yeah.

685
00:34:37,003 --> 00:34:40,740
I'd get inside our camp,
take our ECP, divide us in half.

686
00:34:41,808 --> 00:34:43,341
Pretty much then we're fucked.

687
00:34:44,944 --> 00:34:47,546
Goddamn it, Ro.

688
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:49,448
Who the fuck pissed
in your Cheerios?

689
00:34:51,283 --> 00:34:52,551
Well...

690
00:34:52,584 --> 00:34:54,987
Sorry, pal.
But that's life at Camp Keating.

691
00:34:55,855 --> 00:34:57,824
Any thought how
we stop 'em, Sarge?

692
00:34:59,992 --> 00:35:01,293
We don't.

693
00:35:05,798 --> 00:35:07,033
- There you go.
- I'm good.

694
00:35:07,066 --> 00:35:08,134
Hey, guys.

695
00:35:08,167 --> 00:35:09,869
You think what fucking
happened to Captain Keating

696
00:35:09,902 --> 00:35:11,738
made it back to the news
in the States?

697
00:35:11,771 --> 00:35:13,973
The only news people give
a shit about back in the States

698
00:35:14,006 --> 00:35:15,507
is who's fucking Paris Hilton.

699
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,677
Who the fuck hasn't?

700
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,046
I saw her picture
getting out of the car.

701
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,015
Goddamn it, even the fucking
hajis have seen her snatch.

702
00:35:23,049 --> 00:35:25,752
Yeah, <i>1 Night in Paris,</i> Taliban bestseller.

703
00:35:25,785 --> 00:35:27,653
Ah, there you go.

704
00:35:28,087 --> 00:35:29,621
Goddamn it.

705
00:35:29,655 --> 00:35:32,457
It's a good day when God
made my ass, right, sir?

706
00:35:32,491 --> 00:35:33,960
You know what?
Somebody's gotta be fit around here

707
00:35:33,993 --> 00:35:35,928
for when we go
hand-to-hand with these fucks.

708
00:35:35,962 --> 00:35:37,897
- Know what I'm saying?
- If you go mouth-to-mouth,

709
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,498
this war would be over.

710
00:35:39,531 --> 00:35:41,333
I'll fuck you till
you love me, boy.

711
00:35:41,366 --> 00:35:44,369
You just keep working on
those man tits, Gallegos.

712
00:35:44,402 --> 00:35:45,671
They're intimidated by it.

713
00:35:45,705 --> 00:35:47,472
Somebody's gotta win
this fucking war, man.

714
00:35:48,473 --> 00:35:49,675
Okay.

715
00:35:49,709 --> 00:35:51,043
Let's go. Let me spot you, boy.

716
00:35:51,077 --> 00:35:52,979
Hey, Ro. Let's go, let's go.

717
00:35:53,012 --> 00:35:54,046
- Hey, Ro.
- Come on.

718
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,347
What's going on?

719
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:05,858
Hey, how's it going, man?

720
00:36:05,892 --> 00:36:08,728
How you doing?
Come here. Come here!

721
00:36:09,427 --> 00:36:10,495
Fuck!

722
00:36:11,931 --> 00:36:12,999
Shit.

723
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:16,501
Warning shot!

724
00:36:16,535 --> 00:36:17,804
Fuck!

725
00:36:20,405 --> 00:36:21,506
Motherfucker.

726
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,076
Jesus Christ! Watch where
you're going, you haji fuck!

727
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,411
Motherfucker.
I should fucking wax you.

728
00:36:26,444 --> 00:36:28,446
- What the fuck, is he blind?
- What's going on, Sergeant?

729
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,883
What's this?
What's this, huh?

730
00:36:30,917 --> 00:36:32,819
What's this?

731
00:36:32,852 --> 00:36:35,855
He's taking photos of our camp, sir.
I'll fucking kill him.

732
00:36:35,888 --> 00:36:37,123
Fucker's taking photos.

733
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:40,525
Must be to show the enemy
what we see here from here.

734
00:36:41,894 --> 00:36:43,095
Huh, what is this?

735
00:36:44,396 --> 00:36:46,866
What is this?
Is this a gift?

736
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:48,067
Is this a gift from the Taliban?

737
00:36:50,636 --> 00:36:52,437
So, don't you want one?

738
00:36:55,107 --> 00:36:56,608
You're looking at my scars?

739
00:36:56,642 --> 00:36:59,912
Yeah, you'd be fucked up, too, if you
had a kid-beating dad like my old man.

740
00:36:59,946 --> 00:37:01,013
And he was a fucking cop.

741
00:37:04,784 --> 00:37:06,686
Americans can have
fucked up lives, too.

742
00:37:07,687 --> 00:37:09,755
Drunk a whole bottle
of carpet cleaner once.

743
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:12,158
I puked that up.

744
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:13,558
Couldn't go through with it.

745
00:37:16,629 --> 00:37:19,131
I did have a great mom, though.

746
00:37:19,165 --> 00:37:20,766
I should probably call her...

747
00:37:22,768 --> 00:37:26,772
Did you ever see your mom,
because of the...

748
00:37:26,806 --> 00:37:28,473
Didn't sign up for <i>Jeopardy!,</i>
Thomson.

749
00:37:28,506 --> 00:37:31,409
Shit me. Uh, Sergeant.

750
00:37:31,443 --> 00:37:32,778
It's called a fucking burqa.

751
00:37:32,812 --> 00:37:35,413
A burqa, yeah.

752
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:38,718
Um, what did he do?

753
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,022
Told us the elders
from Kamu paid him

754
00:37:43,055 --> 00:37:44,623
to take photos of our camp.

755
00:37:45,423 --> 00:37:48,694
Probably
for the fucking Talibans.

756
00:37:48,728 --> 00:37:50,830
We'll call another <i>shura,</i>
find out what the fuck happened.

757
00:37:52,832 --> 00:37:56,135
It is important that we find out
which elders in Kamu paid Nasir.

758
00:38:00,505 --> 00:38:03,541
Good boy,
good boy, not bad boy.

759
00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:05,745
What he was doing
was a red flag for us.

760
00:38:05,778 --> 00:38:07,612
Red flag? A communist flag?

761
00:38:07,647 --> 00:38:08,814
- A warning sign.
- Oh.

762
00:38:11,684 --> 00:38:13,185
It is important
that we investigate.

763
00:38:14,687 --> 00:38:17,089
Your son will not be hurt.

764
00:38:17,123 --> 00:38:19,659
If he is innocent,
he'll be back in two or three days.

765
00:38:27,934 --> 00:38:29,936
He says, you have broke
Commander Keating's promise.

766
00:38:29,969 --> 00:38:32,470
You haven't paid them, and now
you steal their children, too.

767
00:38:33,706 --> 00:38:35,141
This money?

768
00:38:35,174 --> 00:38:36,208
It's for building a school.

769
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,912
For bringing
power and water to...

770
00:38:39,946 --> 00:38:41,080
What's that place called?

771
00:38:41,113 --> 00:38:42,547
- Urmul, sir.
- Urmul.

772
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,918
But now I have
to hold on to this.

773
00:38:47,286 --> 00:38:48,721
Until you help me.

774
00:38:51,724 --> 00:38:54,026
It is an honor to be
among such courageous men.

775
00:38:56,729 --> 00:38:58,130
Men who love peace.

776
00:39:00,232 --> 00:39:02,068
Men who want that
peace to spread.

777
00:39:04,602 --> 00:39:05,871
And the projects will spread.

778
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:08,741
If we all work together.

779
00:39:11,576 --> 00:39:12,778
- <i>Inshallah.</i>
- <i>Inshallah.</i>

780
00:39:12,812 --> 00:39:14,180
<i>Inshallah.</i>

781
00:39:17,116 --> 00:39:20,086
Half the Afghan men from
the last <i>shura</i> are gone.

782
00:39:21,253 --> 00:39:22,554
Yeah.

783
00:39:23,189 --> 00:39:24,724
The fighting-age ones.

784
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:29,561
- Griffin, come here.
- Sir.

785
00:39:32,564 --> 00:39:34,033
You got a good handle
on this shit, right?

786
00:39:34,066 --> 00:39:36,601
I mean, you're Cherokee
or something, I don't know.

787
00:39:36,635 --> 00:39:38,536
You're a tribe.
They're a tribe.

788
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,106
It's Chippewa, sir.

789
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,775
But, uh, you know,
I didn't grow up

790
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:47,013
smoking a peace pipe around the fire
with my father and the tribal elders.

791
00:39:48,647 --> 00:39:52,985
But, uh, you know, I know
not to piss them off.

792
00:39:53,019 --> 00:39:57,223
I know that we get shot at a lot
less when the villagers are happy.

793
00:39:57,256 --> 00:39:59,725
That way we can
focus on the mission.

794
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,028
You know what our mission is?

795
00:40:05,064 --> 00:40:06,198
Not really, sir.

796
00:40:06,232 --> 00:40:08,801
Well, we can't accomplish
our mission if we can't survive.

797
00:40:09,902 --> 00:40:11,771
The elders will come around.

798
00:40:11,804 --> 00:40:13,538
They need us as much
as we need them.

799
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:16,208
Yes, sir.

800
00:40:19,011 --> 00:40:20,846
Hey, Larson,
you're SOG, right?

801
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,648
- Yeah, what's up, Sergeant?
- Mohammed, come here.

802
00:40:25,051 --> 00:40:26,584
Tell him exactly
what you told me.

803
00:40:26,618 --> 00:40:27,887
- <i>Salam alaikum,</i> sir.
- <i>Salam,</i> bro.

804
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,055
I've just been to
the village, sir.

805
00:40:29,088 --> 00:40:32,291
My sources are telling me
the Talibans are coming on us.

806
00:40:32,324 --> 00:40:34,693
- Okay.
- The villagers are not happy, sir.

807
00:40:34,727 --> 00:40:37,263
They are complaining about their
money, the school, the road.

808
00:40:37,296 --> 00:40:39,098
The previous <i>shura</i>
didn't go well, sir.

809
00:40:39,131 --> 00:40:41,133
Everything...
And I really believe, sir,

810
00:40:41,167 --> 00:40:43,969
this time my sources are telling me
that the Talibans are coming on us.

811
00:40:44,003 --> 00:40:45,905
- How many are gonna come on us?
- A lot, sir.

812
00:40:45,938 --> 00:40:47,273
I don't know, a lot.

813
00:40:47,306 --> 00:40:49,975
You think like, um,
in a row, or at the same time...

814
00:40:50,009 --> 00:40:51,210
Sir, are you laughing at me?

815
00:40:51,243 --> 00:40:53,179
- No, no.
- I'm sorry.

816
00:40:53,212 --> 00:40:55,014
Sir, do you know
what the problem is?

817
00:40:55,047 --> 00:40:57,349
The British invaded us,
and they didn't listen to us.

818
00:40:57,383 --> 00:40:58,684
They thought we were stupid.

819
00:40:58,717 --> 00:40:59,919
- They were crushed down.
- All right.

820
00:40:59,952 --> 00:41:01,120
The Russians invaded us.

821
00:41:01,153 --> 00:41:03,022
They thought we were stupid,
and they were crushed down.

822
00:41:03,055 --> 00:41:03,889
Mohammed, Mohammed!

823
00:41:03,923 --> 00:41:05,091
And now you make
the same mistake, sir!

824
00:41:05,124 --> 00:41:07,293
Mohammed, we don't need
a fucking history lesson, Okay?

825
00:41:07,326 --> 00:41:09,795
- You know why we don't listen to you?
- Why?

826
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:11,964
Because every week,
you tell us the same damn thing!

827
00:41:11,997 --> 00:41:13,933
- Because...
- You're always crying...

828
00:41:13,966 --> 00:41:16,635
You're always crying wolf.

829
00:41:16,669 --> 00:41:19,839
Of course, we, we have the Taliban
surrounding us all the time.

830
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,241
We're in the middle of Afghanistan.
We get hit every single day.

831
00:41:22,274 --> 00:41:24,844
You coming in and yelling, "The Taliban
is coming. The Taliban is coming,"

832
00:41:24,877 --> 00:41:26,278
is just added pressure, man.

833
00:41:26,312 --> 00:41:29,081
I don't need to learn about the
fucking battle of Normandy from you.

834
00:41:29,115 --> 00:41:30,950
It's cool, man.
We heard you.

835
00:41:31,951 --> 00:41:32,985
It's okay.

836
00:41:33,018 --> 00:41:34,053
- Sir...
- Thank you.

837
00:41:34,086 --> 00:41:35,321
I have a little family.

838
00:41:35,354 --> 00:41:36,956
- I really don't want to die.
- We know.

839
00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:38,290
And I don't want
you to die as well.

840
00:41:38,324 --> 00:41:39,792
- That's all, sir.
- Thank you.

841
00:41:39,825 --> 00:41:42,161
- We won't let you down.
- I've done my job.

842
00:41:42,194 --> 00:41:43,095
Thank you, Mohammed.

843
00:41:43,129 --> 00:41:44,897
You're still my second
favorite Mohammed.

844
00:41:45,898 --> 00:41:47,666
Guy hates dick jokes.

845
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,169
- Yeah.
- Think he's you serious?

846
00:41:50,202 --> 00:41:53,072
I think he'll be serious when he's
the one that's running and hiding.

847
00:41:53,105 --> 00:41:54,106
Yeah.

848
00:41:59,712 --> 00:42:01,280
I wouldn't
trade this for anything.

849
00:42:01,313 --> 00:42:02,948
That right, private?

850
00:42:02,982 --> 00:42:05,384
You'd rather hump gear
or a couple of porn stars?

851
00:42:05,417 --> 00:42:06,452
I'd rather hump gear.

852
00:42:06,485 --> 00:42:09,355
Well, shit, Yunger.
Thank you for your service.

853
00:42:09,388 --> 00:42:10,923
Thank you for your service!

854
00:42:10,956 --> 00:42:12,324
It's worth it
for the brotherhood, man.

855
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:14,960
Look at us, band of brothers!

856
00:42:15,861 --> 00:42:17,830
Like me and Sergeant Martin.

857
00:42:17,863 --> 00:42:20,366
We can just say
anything to one another,

858
00:42:20,399 --> 00:42:22,034
and we're still tight
as fuck, man,

859
00:42:22,067 --> 00:42:24,203
and always will be
after this, right?

860
00:42:24,236 --> 00:42:26,872
Shit, he can call me
a white trash motherfucker,

861
00:42:26,906 --> 00:42:30,709
- and I could call him a nigger, and it doesn't even matter.
- Wait, what?

862
00:42:30,743 --> 00:42:32,044
What the fuck
you just say to me?

863
00:42:32,077 --> 00:42:33,045
You can call me what?

864
00:42:33,078 --> 00:42:34,847
Yo, Yunger, you about
to get your ass whooped.

865
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,882
You Whiskey Tango
cousin fucker you.

866
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:39,151
- Chill, man.
- Go ahead, say that shit again, man.

867
00:42:39,185 --> 00:42:42,354
- I'll slap your fucking nose off.
- All right, knock it off!

868
00:42:42,388 --> 00:42:45,191
You got my blessing to kick his
Whiskey Tango ass when we get back.

869
00:42:45,224 --> 00:42:46,292
You're a dead man, Yunger.

870
00:42:46,325 --> 00:42:47,927
What are they saying?

871
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,329
Can't even make
out this dialect.

872
00:42:50,362 --> 00:42:52,898
I think they're
talking about scarves.

873
00:42:52,932 --> 00:42:55,434
You don't... You don't
speak the goddamn dialect?

874
00:42:55,467 --> 00:42:58,103
All right,
secure the far side.

875
00:42:58,971 --> 00:43:00,206
Sir, let us.

876
00:43:00,906 --> 00:43:02,041
Carter.

877
00:43:02,074 --> 00:43:03,309
Carter, come here.

878
00:43:03,342 --> 00:43:05,211
Kirk, you go.

879
00:43:05,244 --> 00:43:07,346
- You got it.
- Yunger, on me.

880
00:43:09,515 --> 00:43:11,350
Welcome to Denny's.

881
00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:13,319
I'll be your server, Carter.

882
00:43:13,352 --> 00:43:15,087
Don't mind the Goth makeup.

883
00:43:15,988 --> 00:43:17,489
I just hate myself.

884
00:43:21,927 --> 00:43:24,830
Well, okay, rock star,
I'll have a grand slam then.

885
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:27,433
What?

886
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:30,102
Carter, that was
pretty good, man.

887
00:43:30,135 --> 00:43:32,004
- Okay, good to go!
- No?

888
00:43:32,037 --> 00:43:34,340
Captain Yllescas,
this bridge is for shit, sir.

889
00:43:34,373 --> 00:43:36,775
Embrace the suck, Yunger.

890
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:38,477
Yes. Yes, sir.

891
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:39,878
I got a question.

892
00:43:39,912 --> 00:43:42,281
Your old man in the military?

893
00:43:42,314 --> 00:43:44,950
Yes, sir, West Point,
class of '84.

894
00:43:44,984 --> 00:43:46,518
- Really?
- Yeah.

895
00:43:46,552 --> 00:43:49,788
You know a guy
named Nick Coddington?

896
00:43:49,822 --> 00:43:51,056
Yeah, I think
he did, actually.

897
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:52,291
He's a fucking prick.

898
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,463
- You like football, sir?
- I do like football, yeah.

899
00:43:57,496 --> 00:43:59,465
- Thanks for asking.
- Are you, uh, you a basket fan, right?

900
00:43:59,498 --> 00:44:01,567
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, I think they're gonna...

901
00:44:04,937 --> 00:44:06,305
We got
someone down there.

902
00:44:06,338 --> 00:44:08,540
Goddamn it, man,
where's that coming from?

903
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:10,943
Get the fuck down now!

904
00:44:11,877 --> 00:44:13,579
Fuck! Goddamn it!

905
00:44:13,612 --> 00:44:15,080
Anyone got eyes?

906
00:44:15,114 --> 00:44:16,415
Thomson, call it in.

907
00:44:16,448 --> 00:44:18,250
I see movement, 11 o'clock.

908
00:44:18,284 --> 00:44:20,586
Norman, get your fucking
ass down there and grab him.

909
00:44:25,257 --> 00:44:26,425
Yunger.

910
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:29,862
Hey, you okay?

911
00:44:31,297 --> 00:44:32,464
Hey, man!

I think I had like, a piece
of his brain in my mouth, man.

918
00:45:30,657 --> 00:45:33,025
- Blew him right up.
- Oh, Yunger.

919
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,495
Yunger, you okay?

920
00:45:36,528 --> 00:45:38,897
They just blew
him up, Sergeant.

921
00:45:38,931 --> 00:45:41,600
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
I was there.

922
00:45:42,267 --> 00:45:45,571
They just blew him up, man.

923
00:45:45,604 --> 00:45:48,273
I think I had like, a piece
of his brain in my mouth.

924
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:50,643
Yeah.

925
00:45:52,277 --> 00:45:54,913
Yeah, I know, man.
That was, uh...

926
00:45:54,947 --> 00:45:58,450
- It was bad.
- I'm a bad soldier, Sergeant.

927
00:45:58,484 --> 00:46:01,253
- You know, my dad was right. I don't think I can...
- No, no, no, no.

928
00:46:01,286 --> 00:46:03,522
You're a good soldier.

929
00:46:03,555 --> 00:46:05,190
- You're a good soldier, Yunger.
- Don't fucking bull...

930
00:46:05,224 --> 00:46:06,358
Don't bullshit me, man.

931
00:46:06,392 --> 00:46:08,594
I'm not bullshitting you, okay?

932
00:46:08,628 --> 00:46:11,397
I feel so fucked
up, Sergeant, man.

933
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:13,465
Sir, I feel so fucked up.

934
00:46:14,266 --> 00:46:15,567
I know.

935
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:18,404
I know what you're
going through, okay?

936
00:46:18,437 --> 00:46:21,373
The same thing
happened to me in Iraq.

937
00:46:21,407 --> 00:46:24,276
I watched my best friend die.
A fucking sniper.

938
00:46:25,043 --> 00:46:26,211
But, Yunger...

939
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,382
Yunger, you listen to me.

940
00:46:30,416 --> 00:46:32,584
I got a wife and kids
to come home to,

941
00:46:32,618 --> 00:46:34,153
and I made them promises.

942
00:46:36,021 --> 00:46:37,389
So I need you to make a choice.

943
00:46:37,423 --> 00:46:39,391
You gotta get
your shit together,

944
00:46:39,425 --> 00:46:41,093
or we're gonna
get you out of here.

945
00:46:41,126 --> 00:46:42,261
Sergeant.

946
00:46:43,763 --> 00:46:46,699
I'm fucking...
fucking trying, man.

947
00:46:46,733 --> 00:46:48,233
- I just...
- Listen to me.

948
00:46:49,001 --> 00:46:50,068
Sergeant!

949
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:55,174
Get him to the aid station.
We're gonna medevac him out.

950
00:47:02,548 --> 00:47:04,416
All right, guys, let's go.

951
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:09,154
Yunger, it's time to go.

952
00:47:09,188 --> 00:47:10,690
We'll see you in a few months.

953
00:47:16,528 --> 00:47:18,230
Don't let him touch the ground!

954
00:47:33,212 --> 00:47:34,714
That's it? All on.

955
00:47:35,715 --> 00:47:36,850
HESCOS are pretty beat up.

956
00:47:36,883 --> 00:47:39,585
We got double-strand
concertina wire and trip flares

957
00:47:39,618 --> 00:47:41,119
around the entire perimeter.

958
00:47:41,153 --> 00:47:43,055
We're thinking about making
it triple-strand, sir.

959
00:47:43,088 --> 00:47:44,490
And given all
the attacks here, sir

960
00:47:44,523 --> 00:47:46,659
I really think we should
change our Claymore mines.

961
00:47:46,693 --> 00:47:48,728
As I understand it, they've
been out there for over a year,

962
00:47:48,761 --> 00:47:50,529
- and are probably ineffective...
- We'll get into all that later.

963
00:47:50,562 --> 00:47:51,798
How many ANA here?

964
00:47:51,831 --> 00:47:54,266
Uh, 80 on the payroll,
when they all show up,

965
00:47:54,299 --> 00:47:55,467
which is never.

966
00:47:55,501 --> 00:47:58,270
We get 20 at a time, at best.

967
00:47:58,303 --> 00:47:59,571
Sort of what I thought.

968
00:47:59,605 --> 00:48:01,540
- This the TOC?
- It is, sir.

969
00:48:06,578 --> 00:48:08,146
New orders have come down.

970
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,716
We're closing this outpost
come July.

971
00:48:10,516 --> 00:48:11,784
July, sir?

972
00:48:11,818 --> 00:48:12,952
July 6th.

973
00:48:12,986 --> 00:48:15,722
That's where I want you to
concentrate all your efforts,

974
00:48:15,755 --> 00:48:17,489
- closing shop.
- Yes, sir.

975
00:48:18,357 --> 00:48:19,826
Goodnight, gentlemen.

976
00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:21,460
I'll see you in the morning.

977
00:48:21,493 --> 00:48:23,128
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, sir.

978
00:48:26,766 --> 00:48:28,233
July, huh?

979
00:48:29,869 --> 00:48:31,169
Good night.

980
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:44,249
Sir.

981
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,588
What is this?

982
00:48:49,621 --> 00:48:52,357
It's an Afghan
voter ID card, sir.

983
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:55,628
It was at the bridge where Captain
Yllescas was targ... targeted.

984
00:48:55,662 --> 00:48:58,330
It most likely fell out of the prick's
pocket that killed our captain.

985
00:48:59,164 --> 00:49:00,332
Tell him, Malak.

986
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,402
I'm afraid it's true, sir.

987
00:49:03,435 --> 00:49:05,504
I, uh, remember this man.

988
00:49:05,537 --> 00:49:08,340
He was one of the workers
at the hydroelectric plant.

989
00:49:09,842 --> 00:49:11,410
Somebody who we we're employing.

990
00:49:11,443 --> 00:49:13,345
We're not sure
which village he's in.

991
00:49:13,378 --> 00:49:15,480
But I can saddle up
the men, find him.

992
00:49:15,514 --> 00:49:17,416
Absolutely not.

993
00:49:17,449 --> 00:49:20,352
The squadron has appointed
an investigating officer.

994
00:49:20,385 --> 00:49:21,553
We will wait on him to get here.

995
00:49:21,587 --> 00:49:24,423
Sir, by the time he gets here,
that suspect will be gone.

996
00:49:24,456 --> 00:49:26,592
I am not gonna have
you guys antagonize

997
00:49:26,626 --> 00:49:29,461
the population by rousing
families in the villages.

998
00:49:29,494 --> 00:49:31,864
Colonel Spicer will have my ass.

999
00:49:31,898 --> 00:49:34,199
With all due respect,
Captain Broward,

1000
00:49:34,232 --> 00:49:35,868
I think the Colonel
would appreciate it if...

1001
00:49:35,902 --> 00:49:41,139
What the Colonel would appreciate
is we do our jobs and properly,

1002
00:49:41,173 --> 00:49:42,875
especially since we're
outta here come July.

1003
00:49:44,343 --> 00:49:45,745
The man killed our commander.

1004
00:49:50,315 --> 00:49:51,383
I know.

1005
00:49:52,819 --> 00:49:54,353
Justice will be served,
Sergeant.

1006
00:49:56,188 --> 00:49:57,724
Let's get this
to the proper authorities.

1007
00:49:57,757 --> 00:49:58,825
Sir.

1008
00:49:59,792 --> 00:50:00,860
Okay?

1009
00:50:01,894 --> 00:50:03,261
Okay, sir.

1010
00:50:03,863 --> 00:50:05,130
Thank you.

1011
00:50:07,532 --> 00:50:09,434
- Private.
- Sir.

1012
00:50:09,468 --> 00:50:10,837
Let's get this to the burn pit.

1013
00:50:11,603 --> 00:50:12,739
Yes, sir.

1014
00:50:13,438 --> 00:50:14,573
Aw, man.

1015
00:50:17,877 --> 00:50:19,244
- Thank you, sir.
- There you go.

1016
00:50:19,277 --> 00:50:20,479
Have fun dreams.

1017
00:50:20,512 --> 00:50:21,881
Take this.

1018
00:50:21,914 --> 00:50:23,883
I don't want anybody getting
malaria and spitting blood and shit.

1019
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:25,718
- Hey, Scusa.
- I finished.

1020
00:50:25,752 --> 00:50:26,853
I finished my application.

1021
00:50:26,886 --> 00:50:28,453
Application for what?

1022
00:50:28,487 --> 00:50:29,922
This guy wants
to be an officer.

1023
00:50:29,956 --> 00:50:32,290
No, no. I wanna go
to flight school.

1024
00:50:32,324 --> 00:50:33,558
Flight school, Scusa?

1025
00:50:33,592 --> 00:50:35,293
Shit, I wouldn't let you
hand out peanuts

1026
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:36,663
on the Afghan Air, my friend.

1027
00:50:36,696 --> 00:50:38,430
Thanks, Kirk.
That's really nice of you.

1028
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:40,633
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Goodbye, ladies.

1029
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:43,201
You're gonna be a good pilot
and a good officer.

1030
00:50:43,235 --> 00:50:44,336
Thanks, Sergeant.

1031
00:50:44,369 --> 00:50:45,905
But I ain't calling
you "sir" ever.

1032
00:50:45,938 --> 00:50:47,272
Hey, it's all good, Sergeant.

1033
00:50:47,305 --> 00:50:48,473
You can call me
whatever you want.

1034
00:50:49,676 --> 00:50:51,376
I'll think of something.

1035
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:52,577
I'm sure you will.

1036
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,381
Really? An officer and a pilot?

1037
00:50:56,415 --> 00:50:58,617
- Yeah.
- Good luck with those goggles.

1038
00:51:02,021 --> 00:51:03,522
What's up, guys?

1039
00:51:03,555 --> 00:51:05,190
- Morning, Sergeant.
- Morning, Sergeant.

1040
00:51:06,525 --> 00:51:08,593
- How you hanging?
- Not too bad.

1041
00:51:08,628 --> 00:51:10,697
Scusa stole my fucking
cheese tortellini.

1042
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:11,964
Now I got Asian beef strips.

1043
00:51:11,998 --> 00:51:14,332
Hey, my one-year-old
loves 'em?

1044
00:51:14,366 --> 00:51:15,434
Let me see those.

1045
00:51:17,569 --> 00:51:19,772
I'll show you what you do
with this Asian beef dicks.

1046
00:51:22,842 --> 00:51:24,276
.Come here.

1047
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:25,377
Come here, Franklin.

1048
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:27,479
Come on, buddy.

1049
00:51:27,512 --> 00:51:29,782
Hey, see? Even the dogs
don't eat this shit.

1050
00:51:29,816 --> 00:51:31,851
Don't abuse my dog, Sergeant.

1051
00:51:31,884 --> 00:51:34,619
- Shit! Shit!
- Recon, Sergeant!

1052
00:51:38,323 --> 00:51:39,558
- Scusa!
- Yes.

1053
00:51:39,591 --> 00:51:40,860
- Pre-fire!
- Yes, Sergeant!

1054
00:51:43,062 --> 00:51:46,498
Six, Red 2, taking sniper
fire at LRAS 2, over.

1055
00:51:46,531 --> 00:51:48,735
<i>We have movement
at the treetop.</i>

1056
00:51:48,768 --> 00:51:51,637
Requesting fire
mission CRP Bravo 5.

1057
00:51:51,671 --> 00:51:52,705
This is Six.

1058
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:54,573
Can you positively
identify target?

1059
00:51:54,606 --> 00:51:57,309
We have movement
at the tree farm.

1060
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:00,545
Our mortars are laid on, sir.

1061
00:52:00,579 --> 00:52:01,881
<i>Do you have PID?</i>

1062
00:52:01,914 --> 00:52:04,917
Captain Broward,
our mortars are laid on.

1063
00:52:04,951 --> 00:52:06,886
We have dudes who we're
getting sniped from.

1064
00:52:06,919 --> 00:52:10,022
<i>It's fucking obvious where
we're being shot from. Over.</i>

1065
00:52:10,056 --> 00:52:12,992
Do you have PID?
Do you see a weapon?

1066
00:52:13,025 --> 00:52:14,761
Fucking PID.

1067
00:52:15,628 --> 00:52:16,696
- Scusa!
- Yeah.

1068
00:52:16,729 --> 00:52:17,764
We have PID?

1069
00:52:17,797 --> 00:52:19,832
Uh, I see...

1070
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,668
- I see movement!
- Great.

1071
00:52:23,568 --> 00:52:24,871
We have PID, sir.

1072
00:52:24,904 --> 00:52:26,371
Clear to engage.

1073
00:52:26,404 --> 00:52:27,774
Fuck you.

1074
00:52:27,807 --> 00:52:29,008
Tree farm! One round!

1075
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:31,644
Thomson, pack of
smokes says you miss!

1076
00:52:31,677 --> 00:52:32,945
Now you know I love a smoke!

1077
00:52:36,548 --> 00:52:38,785
Rules of engagement
are different here.

1078
00:52:38,818 --> 00:52:41,286
You cannot shoot someone
for acting suspicious.

1079
00:52:41,888 --> 00:52:43,689
Suspicious?

1080
00:52:43,723 --> 00:52:46,491
So where were the bullets
coming from, sir?

1081
00:52:48,426 --> 00:52:52,564
You must PID a weapon
or a radio in an enemy's hand.

1082
00:52:52,597 --> 00:52:54,599
That comes straight
from McChrystal.

1083
00:52:54,634 --> 00:52:56,501
You want your next tour
to be in Leavenworth?

1084
00:52:57,837 --> 00:52:59,371
Well, someone
should tell McChrystal

1085
00:52:59,404 --> 00:53:01,606
that we're not out here
selling popsicles, sir.

1086
00:53:04,543 --> 00:53:09,347
Excessive force alienates the
locals and causes greater risk.

1087
00:53:09,381 --> 00:53:11,851
You better grass that
fucking sentiment now.

1088
00:53:11,884 --> 00:53:15,487
Furthermore, who knows
when we'll be resupplied?

1089
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,923
And we can't waste ammo.

1090
00:53:18,858 --> 00:53:20,392
And one more thing, Sergeant.

1091
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:22,962
You ever speak
to me like that again,

1092
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:25,965
I'll send you to squadron.

1093
00:53:25,998 --> 00:53:28,000
You wanna be a staff bitch
and leave your men?

1094
00:53:29,068 --> 00:53:30,335
No, sir.

1095
00:53:34,506 --> 00:53:36,843
President Karzai doesn't
want American forces to leave

1096
00:53:36,876 --> 00:53:38,410
before the Afghan election.

1097
00:53:39,111 --> 00:53:40,646
General McChrystal agrees.

1098
00:53:41,981 --> 00:53:43,749
You need to let the men know.

1099
00:53:43,783 --> 00:53:46,052
So we're not closing
the outpost in July?

1100
00:53:46,085 --> 00:53:47,720
- That's correct.
- Got it.

1101
00:53:47,753 --> 00:53:49,856
I'm sorry. Maybe October.

1102
00:53:51,057 --> 00:53:51,958
The good news is,

1103
00:53:51,991 --> 00:53:54,093
you'll all receive
an extra $1,000 a month.

1104
00:53:56,629 --> 00:53:57,697
That's all.

1105
00:53:59,431 --> 00:54:01,100
- Thanks, Bundy.
- Let's go.

1106
00:54:02,101 --> 00:54:05,071
- Afternoon, sir.
- Sir.

1107
00:54:05,104 --> 00:54:06,739
Let's get these
to the burn pit.

1108
00:54:06,772 --> 00:54:08,040
Where do you want these?

1109
00:54:08,074 --> 00:54:09,675
Set them right
there on the desk.

1110
00:54:16,615 --> 00:54:17,683
Let's get them to the burn pit.

1111
00:54:21,153 --> 00:54:23,388
You got it, sir.

1112
00:54:25,191 --> 00:54:26,792
Fucking unbelievable.

1113
00:54:28,895 --> 00:54:30,763
You got another
picture from home, I see.

1114
00:54:30,796 --> 00:54:32,064
Yeah, check out these.

1115
00:54:32,098 --> 00:54:33,866
You are a man
obsessed, I swear.

1116
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,668
Mmm-hmm. Who wouldn't be?

1117
00:54:35,701 --> 00:54:37,737
You are a lucky guy,
but I don't know

1118
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:40,206
if it's healthy
to, uh, dwell on her out here.

1119
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:42,041
At least on guard
and all, you know?

1120
00:54:42,642 --> 00:54:44,576
Yeah, I know, I just...

1121
00:54:44,609 --> 00:54:46,779
I keep thinking about where
the big one's gonna come from.

1122
00:54:46,812 --> 00:54:48,513
Hey, fuck it.

1123
00:54:48,546 --> 00:54:49,682
If they come, they come.

1124
00:54:49,715 --> 00:54:50,783
This is our reality now.

1125
00:54:50,816 --> 00:54:52,985
- I know, I know.
- Okay? Focus.

1126
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,088
Only thing that keeps
running through my head

1127
00:54:56,122 --> 00:54:58,224
is how ungrateful I was
when I was at home.

1128
00:54:58,257 --> 00:55:00,726
Look, man, we're
gonna get out of here

1129
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,762
and see our friends,
our families,

1130
00:55:02,795 --> 00:55:04,664
our loved ones, Sophie.

1131
00:55:04,697 --> 00:55:06,198
We're gonna have a chance
to make things right.

1132
00:55:06,232 --> 00:55:07,700
- Yeah.
- Okay?

1133
00:55:07,733 --> 00:55:09,702
- Yeah.
- That's where I need you at right now.

1134
00:55:09,735 --> 00:55:11,804
Okay. Okay.

1135
00:55:11,837 --> 00:55:14,206
Hey, you know what I'm gonna do
when I get back home?

1136
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,641
Tell me.

1137
00:55:15,675 --> 00:55:17,475
- I'm gonna take her in her room.
- Yeah.

1138
00:55:17,509 --> 00:55:18,811
- Yeah, gonna hug her.
- Mmm-hmm.

1139
00:55:18,844 --> 00:55:20,179
- Gonna hold her.
- Mmm-hmm.

1140
00:55:20,212 --> 00:55:22,514
- And let her kiss me all over.
- Yeah.

1141
00:55:22,547 --> 00:55:23,916
Never gonna let her go.

1142
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:26,185
- Yeah, that's one lucky girl.
- Mmm-hmm.

1143
00:55:26,218 --> 00:55:29,021
- Belly rubs for days.
- Yeah.

1144
00:55:59,085 --> 00:56:00,886
- Sir.
- What's up, Carter?

1145
00:56:02,688 --> 00:56:04,824
Can I speak to you under the
commander's open door policy?

1146
00:56:04,857 --> 00:56:06,092
Yeah, What's going on?

1147
00:56:13,132 --> 00:56:15,134
Everyone's worried
about the new CO.

1148
00:56:16,635 --> 00:56:17,837
Okay, how so?

1149
00:56:19,238 --> 00:56:20,306
He doesn't know
what he's doing.

1150
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:22,008
He's scared. It's obvious.

1151
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:24,176
He doesn't leave the TOC
except to take a shit.

1152
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:26,045
Even then, he does it
with an escort.

1153
00:56:26,078 --> 00:56:29,682
I carry his piss every
other day to the burn pit.

1154
00:56:29,715 --> 00:56:31,684
The men call him
Broward the Coward.

1155
00:56:33,252 --> 00:56:34,619
Carter, take a seat.

1156
00:56:36,222 --> 00:56:37,757
Take a seat, Carter. Come on.

1157
00:56:41,593 --> 00:56:45,597
You ever heard of, uh,
Captain Bostick or Colonel Fenty?

1158
00:56:46,032 --> 00:56:47,800
No, sir.

1159
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:51,203
They're two commanders who lost their lives
in this shithole before Keating and Yllescas.

1160
00:56:51,837 --> 00:56:53,839
Okay.

1161
00:56:53,873 --> 00:56:55,741
This commander is
a 37-year-old captain,

1162
00:56:55,775 --> 00:56:58,978
who has seen a whole lot of
death in Iraq before he got here.

1163
00:56:59,011 --> 00:57:01,613
And he's probably seen more firefights
than you've seen in the movies.

1164
00:57:03,849 --> 00:57:07,720
And despite all that, despite the shitty
odds stacked against him, he's here anyway.

1165
00:57:09,621 --> 00:57:11,891
People much smarter than you or
I put him here, and that's it.

1166
00:57:15,094 --> 00:57:17,196
We will all do as he
fucking says, Carter.

1167
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:21,167
Yes, sir.

1168
00:57:23,135 --> 00:57:24,270
And, Carter...

1169
00:57:26,338 --> 00:57:29,942
I better never, ever,
ever hear that fucking nickname again,

1170
00:57:29,975 --> 00:57:31,210
from you or anybody else.

1171
00:57:32,778 --> 00:57:33,946
Good to go?

1172
00:57:35,681 --> 00:57:36,749
Yes, sir.

1173
00:57:38,751 --> 00:57:39,819
Thank you.

1174
00:57:56,001 --> 00:57:57,636
<i>You awake, Carter?</i>

1175
00:58:02,108 --> 00:58:03,642
Yeah, I'm awake, Sergeant.

1176
00:58:04,743 --> 00:58:06,345
<i>Good.</i>

1177
00:58:06,378 --> 00:58:08,814
<i>'Cause I don't exactly feel like lugging
my ass out there to check on you.</i>

1178
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:14,120
Well, all, all good out here.

1179
00:58:16,222 --> 00:58:18,757
<i>Just because I'm not
watching, doesn't mean God isn't.</i>

1180
00:58:23,162 --> 00:58:25,698
You know, Jesus was
a pacifist, Sergeant.

1181
00:58:27,099 --> 00:58:29,902
I joined...
volunteered for a war.

1182
00:58:31,203 --> 00:58:32,204
You understand?

1183
00:58:33,038 --> 00:58:34,974
I think that, uh...

1184
00:58:35,007 --> 00:58:38,177
I think that tells you where,
where God and I stand.

1185
00:58:40,246 --> 00:58:42,014
<i>You read the Bible, Carter?</i>

1186
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,782
<i>Violent as hell.</i>

1187
00:58:43,816 --> 00:58:46,719
<i>Full of stories about
Christians using force for good.</i>

1188
00:58:46,752 --> 00:58:48,420
Yeah, I've read it.
Muslims think they're good,

1189
00:58:48,454 --> 00:58:50,122
using force for good, too.

1190
00:58:51,991 --> 00:58:53,692
<i>Well,
we can't both be right.</i>

1191
00:58:56,762 --> 00:58:58,430
We can both be wrong.

1192
00:59:00,966 --> 00:59:03,135
<i>Keep your ass awake. Out.</i>

1193
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:05,938
Yeah, fuck you.

1194
00:59:14,013 --> 00:59:16,382
I see movement,
but I don't see a weapon.

1195
00:59:16,415 --> 00:59:17,783
Maybe it's a spotter.

1196
00:59:21,854 --> 00:59:23,022
Shit, shit, shit!

1197
00:59:23,889 --> 00:59:26,025
Fuck!

1198
00:59:26,058 --> 00:59:27,793
Well, that one was closer!

1199
00:59:27,826 --> 00:59:30,095
Yeah, 150 meters.

1200
00:59:30,129 --> 00:59:31,864
They're walking them in.

1201
00:59:31,897 --> 00:59:34,400
I can't believe
these fuckers have mortars now.

1202
00:59:34,433 --> 00:59:36,368
- Son of a bitch!
- <i>Shots fired.</i>

1203
00:59:36,402 --> 00:59:39,405
<i>Yankee, Foxtrot, 15627.</i>

1204
00:59:39,438 --> 00:59:42,341
<i>Sir,
those grid coordinates are 40 miles away.</i>

1205
00:59:42,374 --> 00:59:43,409
<i>You mean Yankee, Echo?</i>

1206
00:59:43,442 --> 00:59:45,911
- Yeah, shit.
- Yankee, Echo.

1207
00:59:45,945 --> 00:59:47,246
Now he's fucking spooked.

1208
00:59:47,279 --> 00:59:49,348
He's calling the wrong
fucking coordinates!

1209
00:59:50,149 --> 00:59:53,752
15627890.

1210
00:59:54,987 --> 00:59:56,889
<i>Let's get some Willie Pete
on their asses.</i>

1211
01:00:02,294 --> 01:00:04,863
They were walking mortars in
and at night.

1212
01:00:04,897 --> 01:00:06,899
Which means they have
night vision now, sir.

1213
01:00:06,932 --> 01:00:08,167
Has this
ever happened before?

1214
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,335
No, sir.

1215
01:00:09,368 --> 01:00:11,403
Well, where'd they get 'em from?
Fucking ANA?

1216
01:00:11,437 --> 01:00:13,305
I don't know, but we'll get
accountability, sir.

1217
01:00:13,339 --> 01:00:15,307
Captain Broward. Captain.

1218
01:00:15,341 --> 01:00:17,943
Okay, make sure that happens.

1219
01:00:17,977 --> 01:00:19,778
- You got it, sir.
- What is it, Specialist?

1220
01:00:19,812 --> 01:00:22,181
There's a situation
at the ANA gate, sir.

1221
01:00:22,214 --> 01:00:23,349
What's the situation?

1222
01:00:23,382 --> 01:00:25,484
There's elders from the village.

1223
01:00:25,517 --> 01:00:27,753
Fuck.

1224
01:00:34,093 --> 01:00:35,394
You killed his daughter,
Captain,

1225
01:00:35,427 --> 01:00:37,062
with white phosphorous

1226
01:00:37,096 --> 01:00:38,430
in the mortar attack
last night.

1227
01:00:38,464 --> 01:00:41,133
If his daughter is dead,
then you have my sincerest condolences.

1228
01:00:42,234 --> 01:00:43,769
No "if," sir.

1229
01:00:47,172 --> 01:00:49,975
Sir, this isn't our job,
This girl's been dead for days.

1230
01:00:50,009 --> 01:00:52,878
This is what Americans bring.
This is the death you bring.

1231
01:00:52,911 --> 01:00:54,480
No, this is Taliban.
This isn't us.

1232
01:00:54,513 --> 01:00:57,116
The American government will pay
a condolence fee of 3,500 once...

1233
01:00:57,149 --> 01:00:59,852
- Sir, permission to speak.
- Speak, Sergeant.

1234
01:00:59,885 --> 01:01:01,253
They killed this girl, sir.

1235
01:01:01,287 --> 01:01:03,188
And now they're
fucking cashing in, sir.

1236
01:01:03,222 --> 01:01:06,425
I understand, Sergeant.
Let me handle this.

1237
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:09,261
Everybody knows
you are leaving soon.

1238
01:01:09,295 --> 01:01:12,398
If we do not get paid now,
we will never get paid.

1239
01:01:12,431 --> 01:01:14,366
Why do you say, we're leaving?
We're not leaving.

1240
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,268
- Why does he say we're leaving?
- No idea, sir.

1241
01:01:25,477 --> 01:01:26,545
He claims
the dog bit him, sir.

1242
01:01:26,578 --> 01:01:28,847
Get this man to our medic.
We'll take care of him.

1243
01:01:28,881 --> 01:01:30,182
It's not so simple.

1244
01:01:30,215 --> 01:01:32,851
To be bitten by a dog is
extremely shameful in our culture.

1245
01:01:32,885 --> 01:01:34,420
They expect retribution.

1246
01:01:37,089 --> 01:01:38,324
They want retribution, sir.

1247
01:01:38,357 --> 01:01:39,925
This is fucking bullshit.

1248
01:01:42,928 --> 01:01:44,029
Fuck!

1249
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:45,264
What the fuck?

1250
01:01:46,965 --> 01:01:48,367
It'd be great
if we could all hang out,

1251
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,537
just playing with dogs,
Witness Specialist Scusa,

1252
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:53,572
but we're soldiers
in Afghanistan.

1253
01:01:53,605 --> 01:01:55,407
We're not in a fucking dog park.

1254
01:02:00,312 --> 01:02:02,314
Pay this man from the
commander's discretionary fund.

1255
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:19,965
1,000, 2,000, 3,000,
4,000, 5,000, 6,000!

1256
01:02:22,301 --> 01:02:23,936
I don't care
what anyone fucking says,

1257
01:02:23,969 --> 01:02:25,070
man, that shit's torture.

1258
01:02:27,139 --> 01:02:28,907
Fuck that.
Broward should have a go.

1259
01:02:29,676 --> 01:02:31,276
I lasted 10 seconds.

1260
01:02:32,511 --> 01:02:33,879
A year ago in Iraq.

1261
01:02:38,183 --> 01:02:39,351
Boosting morale?

1262
01:02:40,185 --> 01:02:41,253
Trying, sir.

1263
01:02:46,191 --> 01:02:47,526
I've been relieved
of duty, gentlemen.

1264
01:02:49,294 --> 01:02:51,096
A bird's gonna get me out
of here in a day or two.

1265
01:02:53,332 --> 01:02:56,068
Captain Stoney Portis is gonna
take over in a couple of weeks.

1266
01:02:56,101 --> 01:02:59,672
And the sorties to close down
Combat Outpost Keating October 6th.

1267
01:03:02,174 --> 01:03:03,575
You're in charge
until then, Lieutenant.

1268
01:03:06,245 --> 01:03:07,246
Sir.

1269
01:03:11,417 --> 01:03:12,418
Gentlemen.

1270
01:03:12,886 --> 01:03:14,353
- Sir.
- Sir.

1271
01:03:14,386 --> 01:03:15,554
- Sir.
- Sir.

1272
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:19,324
Stoney Portis
is bad ass, man.

1273
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:20,459
Dude's legit.

1274
01:03:20,492 --> 01:03:21,628
Didn't you fuckers hear him?

1275
01:03:21,661 --> 01:03:23,295
- What?
- We're going home.

1276
01:03:23,328 --> 01:03:25,464
Just when I was starting to
have some fucking fun, right?

1277
01:03:25,497 --> 01:03:26,666
I mean, we've heard
this shit before, right?

1278
01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:29,001
Yeah, they wouldn't have
scheduled the birds, man, if...

1279
01:03:29,034 --> 01:03:30,637
if it wasn't happening
for real.

1280
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:31,704
He's right.

1281
01:03:31,738 --> 01:03:34,006
- That's a good point.
- Yeah.

1282
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:36,542
The Taliban cannot
fucking find out about this.

1283
01:03:36,575 --> 01:03:38,977
All right? None of this
gets talked about in Skype,

1284
01:03:39,011 --> 01:03:40,345
radio, e-mails, nothing.

1285
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:42,514
- Check?
- Check.

1286
01:03:42,548 --> 01:03:43,883
They ain't getting
the drop on us, LT.

1287
01:03:43,917 --> 01:03:47,085
Because, guys, our mission from
now on is what it's always been.

1288
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:49,321
Yeah. To survive.

1289
01:03:52,424 --> 01:03:53,959
Hey, hey,
can you hear me?

1290
01:03:55,728 --> 01:03:58,130
You think I don't like
being there with him?

1291
01:03:58,163 --> 01:04:00,165
He's growing up without me.

1292
01:04:00,199 --> 01:04:03,435
Just... You know
this is how it goes.

1293
01:04:04,303 --> 01:04:06,171
Remember, it's all good.

1294
01:04:07,105 --> 01:04:09,408
You know I love you. Okay.

1295
01:04:09,441 --> 01:04:12,611
If it's getting that bad
for you, I'll get out, okay?

1296
01:04:12,645 --> 01:04:15,247
I'll finish this deployment,
and we'll start a family.

1297
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,749
I gotta go now, baby.

1298
01:04:17,516 --> 01:04:19,017
I love you.

1299
01:04:19,051 --> 01:04:22,054
All right, keep me
in your prayers, okay?

1300
01:04:22,087 --> 01:04:24,423
And tell Dad to stop
being a wise ass.

1301
01:04:24,456 --> 01:04:26,492
Okay, God bless, Mama.

1302
01:04:26,525 --> 01:04:28,527
Love to you and Dad,
all right?

1303
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,230
I poured the whole thing
on his head.

1304
01:04:33,933 --> 01:04:35,200
Yeah, I know.

1305
01:04:36,068 --> 01:04:37,536
Oh, yeah, no, it was fine.

1306
01:04:37,569 --> 01:04:39,672
He didn't really...
All right, uh,

1307
01:04:39,706 --> 01:04:41,073
I gotta go, Mom.

1308
01:04:42,474 --> 01:04:44,610
I love you, too.

1309
01:04:44,644 --> 01:04:48,080
Brittany, is that my son?
Put him on the phone.

1310
01:04:49,081 --> 01:04:50,717
Hazim, hey, man!

1311
01:04:54,186 --> 01:04:56,121
I'm just working
on my fucking tan.

1312
01:04:57,089 --> 01:04:58,624
I'm not fucking cussing.

1313
01:04:58,658 --> 01:05:00,259
I love you, Blue Eyes.

1314
01:05:01,593 --> 01:05:02,594
Bye.

1315
01:05:03,595 --> 01:05:05,698
Yeah, yeah, eating enough.

1316
01:05:07,266 --> 01:05:08,367
Love you, Gam-Gam.

1317
01:05:09,368 --> 01:05:11,403
Trust me, babe, I quit.

1318
01:05:11,436 --> 01:05:12,672
I wouldn't touch those things.

1319
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:16,643
Uh, me too. Me too.

1320
01:05:18,443 --> 01:05:20,813
<i>♪ Six, seven, eight, nine, ten ♪</i>

1321
01:05:20,847 --> 01:05:23,282
<i>♪ I put that fish
right back again ♪</i>

1322
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:28,287
I have to go, sweetheart,
and you have to get to bed.

1323
01:05:29,889 --> 01:05:31,758
Oh, fuck it.

1324
01:05:34,259 --> 01:05:38,196
Okay, on the news...
When you watch the news on TV,

1325
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:40,532
you see bad guys
doing bad things

1326
01:05:40,566 --> 01:05:42,467
to good people
like you and mommy?

1327
01:05:42,501 --> 01:05:44,469
It's my job to take care
of the bad guys,

1328
01:05:46,171 --> 01:05:48,206
to find them
and to kill them, sweetie.

1329
01:06:02,689 --> 01:06:05,090
Okay, Miller,
go get some sleep, man.

1330
01:06:14,734 --> 01:06:16,903
Hey, Gallegos.

1331
01:06:16,936 --> 01:06:19,371
Walked around this whole base
like a half hour ago.

1332
01:06:19,404 --> 01:06:20,707
Uh...

1333
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:21,841
Fresh batteries.

1334
01:06:23,241 --> 01:06:24,443
Everyone's fucking good, man.

1335
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:26,244
Get some rack, man.

1336
01:06:26,746 --> 01:06:27,747
Rack out.

1337
01:06:29,381 --> 01:06:32,484
Mace, relief, buddy,
just as soon as I am, all right?

1338
01:06:32,517 --> 01:06:33,619
Morning, Sergeant.

1339
01:06:34,821 --> 01:06:36,923
Hey, Sergeant.

1340
01:06:36,956 --> 01:06:40,459
- Yeah.
- If you had to fuck one guy, gun to your head,

1341
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:42,561
who would it be?

1342
01:06:43,029 --> 01:06:44,797
No gun necessary.

1343
01:06:44,831 --> 01:06:45,865
Chuck Norris.

1344
01:06:47,232 --> 01:06:48,935
I always thought
a beard would feel nice.

1345
01:06:48,968 --> 01:06:51,236
Yeah, seems excessive.

1346
01:06:51,269 --> 01:06:53,238
Hundreds are
coming on us!

1347
01:06:53,271 --> 01:06:57,342
They... The Taliban...
The villagers are all gone.

1348
01:06:57,376 --> 01:06:59,646
The Talibans are here!

1349
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:01,446
The villagers are all gone.

1350
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:02,949
The Talibans are here!

1351
01:07:02,982 --> 01:07:05,350
Hundreds are coming on us!

1352
01:07:05,384 --> 01:07:06,853
Hundreds are coming on us!

1353
01:07:06,886 --> 01:07:09,421
That's what she said.

1354
01:07:09,454 --> 01:07:12,959
Seriously, he fucking said that before.
Last week, twice.

1355
01:07:12,992 --> 01:07:14,861
- I know.
- Guy needs a new catchphrase.

1356
01:07:40,452 --> 01:07:41,486
Fuck me.

1357
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:47,492
Just another fucking day
in Afghanistan.

1358
01:07:48,828 --> 01:07:50,863
Bro, that incoming
or outgoing?

1359
01:07:50,897 --> 01:07:51,931
Outgoing?

1360
01:07:53,032 --> 01:07:54,366
Nope, incoming.

1361
01:07:54,399 --> 01:07:56,002
Hey, get up!

1362
01:07:56,035 --> 01:07:58,004
All right, boys,
we got contact.

1363
01:07:58,037 --> 01:07:59,337
Everybody get up, now!

1364
01:08:01,841 --> 01:08:02,909
Fucking here too.

1365
01:08:20,525 --> 01:08:21,526
Jesus Christ.

1366
01:08:26,331 --> 01:08:27,365
Fuck!

1367
01:08:32,038 --> 01:08:33,005
Wong, what do we got?

1368
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:35,675
Sir, guard post
reporting heavy contact.

1369
01:08:36,341 --> 01:08:37,275
From where?

1370
01:08:37,309 --> 01:08:40,880
Switchbacks, north face,
fucking everywhere.

1371
01:08:40,913 --> 01:08:42,014
Why aren't our fucking
mortars up, Wong?

1372
01:08:42,048 --> 01:08:44,349
Why aren't our fucking mortars up?
Get 'em up now.

1373
01:08:44,382 --> 01:08:46,786
- Thomson, go to work, Thomson!
- Yeah, I'm on it.

1374
01:08:46,819 --> 01:08:49,321
RPG raw.
Yes, heavy fire.

1375
01:08:51,523 --> 01:08:55,828
RPG raw. RPG raw.
Switchback, switchback, switch...

1376
01:08:55,862 --> 01:08:56,896
Fuck!

1377
01:08:56,929 --> 01:08:59,031
Thomson's down!
Thomson's down!

1378
01:09:04,036 --> 01:09:05,037
Shit!

1379
01:09:09,374 --> 01:09:11,010
Come on, Rod, get up!

1380
01:09:11,043 --> 01:09:12,078
Rod!

1381
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:20,519
Rod, what's going on?

1382
01:09:20,552 --> 01:09:21,954
Thomson's down!

1383
01:09:21,988 --> 01:09:23,421
- Thomson's down!
- I'm coming up. I'm coming up.

1384
01:09:24,791 --> 01:09:27,927
Rod, come on. Come on.
Come on, let's go!

1385
01:09:29,862 --> 01:09:31,798
Tell Bostick
we need fucking air now!

1386
01:09:31,831 --> 01:09:33,331
Rod, over.
Thomson is KIA.

1387
01:09:33,365 --> 01:09:34,634
Repeat, Thomson is KIA.

1388
01:09:34,667 --> 01:09:35,835
<i>X-ray, be advised.</i>

1389
01:09:35,868 --> 01:09:37,402
<i>Due to weather,
Apaches are down,</i>

1390
01:09:37,435 --> 01:09:38,470
<i>It's gonna be two more hours.</i>

1391
01:09:38,503 --> 01:09:39,972
Copy that.
Headed to LRAS 1.

1392
01:09:40,006 --> 01:09:41,540
- Gallegos, LRAS 2.
- Got it.

1393
01:09:41,573 --> 01:09:42,407
LRAS, move your ass.

1394
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:43,943
I'm heading to ECP.
No fucking around.

1395
01:09:43,976 --> 01:09:45,812
- ECP, Good, good.
- I'm sending your ass to the <i>shura</i> buildings.

1396
01:09:45,845 --> 01:09:46,879
We fucked up there.

1397
01:09:46,913 --> 01:09:47,880
Why you sending me, Ro?

1398
01:09:47,914 --> 01:09:49,682
You ready? This is the big one.
Saddle up!

1399
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,520
Easy there, mate.

1400
01:09:55,554 --> 01:09:56,989
It's gonna be
a long fucking day.

1401
01:09:57,023 --> 01:09:59,058
Look at these Afghan cowards!

1402
01:10:03,428 --> 01:10:05,397
We gotta get to Larson.

1403
01:10:05,430 --> 01:10:07,066
We gotta get
to LRAS soon, man.

1404
01:10:07,099 --> 01:10:08,533
- All right.
- On me.

1405
01:10:08,567 --> 01:10:09,635
Let's do it.

1406
01:10:09,669 --> 01:10:10,569
Fuck!

1407
01:10:10,602 --> 01:10:13,505
Friendlies,
friendlies, friendlies!

1408
01:10:15,574 --> 01:10:16,742
I'm coming, Thomson.

1409
01:10:16,776 --> 01:10:17,910
Fuck!

1410
01:10:26,152 --> 01:10:27,954
Friendlies coming in.

1411
01:10:27,987 --> 01:10:29,922
Here to save your ass, Larson!

1412
01:10:30,656 --> 01:10:31,757
Olive Garden!

1413
01:10:33,525 --> 01:10:36,963
Move further to the left,
further to the left!

1414
01:10:36,996 --> 01:10:40,432
- On target, keep engaging, keep engaging!
- Tell me what I am looking at!

1415
01:10:40,465 --> 01:10:41,801
- Need any help?
- Keep it.

1416
01:10:41,834 --> 01:10:43,636
No, we're gonna
need fucking ammo.

1417
01:10:43,669 --> 01:10:45,671
RPG raw, Hector 100...

1418
01:10:52,144 --> 01:10:54,714
Stand-to One,
I'm fucking black on ammo.

1419
01:10:54,747 --> 01:10:56,716
Fucking black on .50 cal.

1420
01:10:56,749 --> 01:10:57,750
Get out of the fucking way!

1421
01:10:59,785 --> 01:11:01,453
Fucker!

1422
01:11:01,486 --> 01:11:03,022
Get up, Carter.
Get the fuck up!

1423
01:11:03,055 --> 01:11:04,090
Let's go!

1424
01:11:04,123 --> 01:11:05,057
We need fucking 240.

1425
01:11:05,091 --> 01:11:06,859
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- 240.

1426
01:11:06,893 --> 01:11:07,994
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, hand it out!

1427
01:11:08,027 --> 01:11:09,427
Let's go!

1428
01:11:09,461 --> 01:11:10,495
- Keep engaging.
- Fuck!

1429
01:11:10,528 --> 01:11:11,697
Keep engaging!

1430
01:11:11,731 --> 01:11:13,465
Fuck!

1431
01:11:13,498 --> 01:11:15,101
It's fucking hard lined, bro.

1432
01:11:15,134 --> 01:11:16,802
Gallegos,
get in the truck!

1433
01:11:20,072 --> 01:11:21,173
Fuck!

1434
01:11:25,477 --> 01:11:26,511
You good, mate?

1435
01:11:26,544 --> 01:11:27,647
I'm good.

1436
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:29,782
Is that all
the fucking ammo we got?

1437
01:11:29,815 --> 01:11:31,416
- Is that all we got?
- Fucking is, man.

1438
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,887
This is LRAS 2.

1439
01:11:34,921 --> 01:11:35,788
We're pinned down.

1440
01:11:35,821 --> 01:11:37,489
We're gonna need some
more fucking ammo.

1441
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:39,025
Let's go, faster.

1442
01:11:39,058 --> 01:11:40,793
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1443
01:11:40,826 --> 01:11:42,427
Let's go, fucking move!

1444
01:11:46,999 --> 01:11:48,067
Oh, shit.

1445
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:49,467
Koppes!

1446
01:11:49,501 --> 01:11:50,836
Keep lighting up that area.

1447
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:52,705
You got a Kevlar blanket
and you're good to go.

1448
01:11:52,738 --> 01:11:54,472
We'll keep ammo
coming your way.

1449
01:11:54,506 --> 01:11:55,942
- Thanks, Sergeant.
- I got it.

1450
01:12:04,951 --> 01:12:06,118
Hey, Carter!

1451
01:12:06,152 --> 01:12:08,020
Are you my ammo resupply?

1452
01:12:08,054 --> 01:12:09,822
- No!
- Oh, fuck!

1453
01:12:10,756 --> 01:12:11,757
Shit.

1454
01:12:13,826 --> 01:12:15,161
Romesha, you all right?

1455
01:12:15,194 --> 01:12:16,829
Move, you fucking pussy.

1456
01:12:18,197 --> 01:12:20,633
Hey, we're gonna
get you more ammo!

1457
01:12:20,666 --> 01:12:22,168
Kirk, you good?

1458
01:12:22,201 --> 01:12:23,636
Yeah, fuck.

1459
01:12:23,669 --> 01:12:26,772
All right, we're gonna
go on my count, on three!

1460
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:28,874
Fuck

1461
01:12:28,908 --> 01:12:31,043
One... Damn it, Kirk!

1462
01:12:32,544 --> 01:12:34,747
Kirk, RPG!

1463
01:12:37,549 --> 01:12:39,285
Kirk down!

1464
01:12:39,318 --> 01:12:40,920
Kirk, you're gonna be all right!

1465
01:12:42,154 --> 01:12:44,023
Sir, sir.

1466
01:12:44,056 --> 01:12:45,858
We need... We need
the Blackhawks in here.

1467
01:12:45,891 --> 01:12:46,959
My men can't fight anymore.

1468
01:12:46,993 --> 01:12:48,194
Birds can't land
till your boys

1469
01:12:48,227 --> 01:12:49,628
help us drive back the Taliban.

1470
01:12:49,662 --> 01:12:51,263
We're out of ammunition.

1471
01:12:51,297 --> 01:12:52,530
We need air support.

1472
01:12:52,564 --> 01:12:55,101
Get your shit together,
and get your men to fucking fight.

1473
01:12:55,134 --> 01:12:56,802
We gotta free up our mortars,
or none of us

1474
01:12:56,836 --> 01:12:58,170
are getting out of here
fucking alive.

1475
01:12:58,204 --> 01:13:00,106
Sir, Kirk's hit.
They need a medic.

1476
01:13:00,139 --> 01:13:01,173
Fuck, come on!

1477
01:13:04,176 --> 01:13:06,812
<i>Kirk is down in the</i>
shura <i>buildings. Severe head trauma.</i>

1478
01:13:06,846 --> 01:13:08,613
Fuck it, bro.
I'm going for Kirk.

1479
01:13:08,647 --> 01:13:09,682
Take your gun.

1480
01:13:10,783 --> 01:13:11,817
Fuck!

1481
01:13:11,851 --> 01:13:13,919
Jesus. Jesus fucking shit.

1482
01:13:13,953 --> 01:13:16,255
- Take your fucking rifle!
- Fuck.

1483
01:13:19,825 --> 01:13:20,993
Fuck!

1484
01:13:21,894 --> 01:13:22,928
Shit.

1485
01:13:29,368 --> 01:13:31,637
Jesus Christ, what the fuck?

1486
01:13:47,319 --> 01:13:48,354
Don't worry.

1487
01:13:48,387 --> 01:13:50,089
Don't worry.
You're gonna be okay.

1488
01:13:50,122 --> 01:13:51,223
What have we got?
What have we got?

1489
01:13:51,257 --> 01:13:52,892
- Shot to the face.
- Fuck.

1490
01:13:52,925 --> 01:13:54,794
All right, shit.
Hold on, we can't treat him here.

1491
01:13:54,827 --> 01:13:56,328
- We gotta get him back to Cordova.
- Okay.

1492
01:13:56,362 --> 01:13:58,130
Good, hold on.

1493
01:13:58,164 --> 01:14:00,066
Don't worry, don't worry.
You're gonna be all right.

1494
01:14:00,099 --> 01:14:02,034
All right, grab his head.
Get him ready.

1495
01:14:02,068 --> 01:14:05,037
Lift on three, two, lift... in.

1496
01:14:05,071 --> 01:14:06,105
You got it?

1497
01:14:06,138 --> 01:14:08,274
Lift on one,
two, three, lift, go.

1498
01:14:08,307 --> 01:14:09,708
Careful.

1499
01:14:13,345 --> 01:14:14,313
You got him, got him?

1500
01:14:14,346 --> 01:14:16,682
Come on, goddamn it!

1501
01:14:16,715 --> 01:14:17,683
We got you.

1502
01:14:17,716 --> 01:14:19,251
- Come on!
- You're gonna be all right.

1503
01:14:19,285 --> 01:14:20,820
Oh, fuck, what the fuck?

1504
01:14:20,853 --> 01:14:21,887
Fuck!

1505
01:14:21,921 --> 01:14:23,621
Hey, shut your fucking mouth!

1506
01:14:23,656 --> 01:14:24,490
Get down!

1507
01:14:24,523 --> 01:14:26,158
We need to figure
out who needs what.

1508
01:14:26,192 --> 01:14:28,194
Everyone needs
fucking everything.

1509
01:14:29,395 --> 01:14:31,330
Griffin, the <i>shura</i> building.

1510
01:14:31,363 --> 01:14:32,398
<i>Shura</i> building, check.

1511
01:14:32,431 --> 01:14:35,634
- LRAS 1.
- Check.

1512
01:14:35,668 --> 01:14:38,838
Scusa, get this
to Gallegos at LRAS 2.

1513
01:14:38,871 --> 01:14:40,272
Okay?

1514
01:14:40,306 --> 01:14:41,340
It's all good, Sergeant.

1515
01:14:41,373 --> 01:14:43,175
All right.
All right. Go.

1516
01:14:43,209 --> 01:14:44,276
Yes, Sergeant!

1517
01:14:45,811 --> 01:14:46,846
Fuck.

1518
01:14:46,879 --> 01:14:49,248
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1519
01:14:56,355 --> 01:14:57,923
It's all right, Scusa.

1520
01:14:57,957 --> 01:14:59,125
Fuck!

1521
01:14:59,959 --> 01:15:00,960
We're coming, Scusa.

1522
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:09,135
I got this.

1523
01:15:09,835 --> 01:15:10,970
Come on.

1524
01:15:11,003 --> 01:15:12,905
Scusa, let's go!

1525
01:15:12,938 --> 01:15:13,973
Go, go, go.

1526
01:15:14,006 --> 01:15:15,174
We're coming in to medic.

1527
01:15:15,207 --> 01:15:17,009
All right, stay with me, Kirk.
Come on, buddy.

1528
01:15:17,042 --> 01:15:18,344
- Doc, where do you want him?
- Scusa's hit.

1529
01:15:18,377 --> 01:15:19,411
Get out of the way,
get out of the way.

1530
01:15:19,445 --> 01:15:20,579
Scusa's fucking hit.

1531
01:15:20,613 --> 01:15:21,714
All right, stay with me, Kirk.
Stay with me.

1532
01:15:21,747 --> 01:15:22,781
Talk to me, guys,
talks to me. What happened?

1533
01:15:22,815 --> 01:15:24,817
I'm not sure.
I think he got hit in the neck.

1534
01:15:25,951 --> 01:15:27,086
How's Kirk doing?

1535
01:15:27,119 --> 01:15:28,754
I got a pulse,
sir, but it's weak.

1536
01:15:28,787 --> 01:15:29,788
It's really weak.

1537
01:15:30,422 --> 01:15:31,423
What have you got, man?

1538
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:34,894
- He's gone.
- What?

1539
01:15:34,927 --> 01:15:36,061
- No.
- He's gone.

1540
01:15:36,095 --> 01:15:37,496
Put him in my room.
He's gone.

1541
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:38,764
- I sent him out there, man.
- Just get out of here. You're in the way.

1542
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:42,868
Holy shit.
Is that Kirk?

1543
01:15:42,902 --> 01:15:44,103
Fuck this hell, man.

1544
01:15:46,805 --> 01:15:47,973
We gotta help Gallegos.

1545
01:15:48,507 --> 01:15:50,142
Generator.

1546
01:15:52,945 --> 01:15:54,246
Understood, sir.

1547
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,314
- Sir.
- SOG.

1548
01:15:55,347 --> 01:15:56,482
Sir.

1549
01:15:56,515 --> 01:15:58,217
Apaches are wheels
up in 40 minutes.

1550
01:15:58,250 --> 01:15:59,251
If we don't get
these guys ammo,

1551
01:15:59,285 --> 01:16:00,886
we're not gonna be here
in 40 fucking minutes.

1552
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,229
Ah, shit! Fuck!

1553
01:16:11,263 --> 01:16:12,431
Fucking gun's down, man.

1554
01:16:12,464 --> 01:16:13,832
Larson talk to me, man.

1555
01:16:13,866 --> 01:16:15,034
The .50 cal's broken!

1556
01:16:15,067 --> 01:16:16,101
Larson, talk to me.

1557
01:16:16,135 --> 01:16:17,169
They fucking
blew it up, man!

1558
01:16:17,203 --> 01:16:18,304
Oh, for fuck...
Goddamn it!

1559
01:16:18,337 --> 01:16:21,073
This is LRAS 2.
Where the fuck is our ammo?

1560
01:16:21,106 --> 01:16:22,208
<i>Moving as fast as we can.</i>

1561
01:16:22,241 --> 01:16:23,876
We don't fucking
need the ammo, man.

1562
01:16:23,909 --> 01:16:25,911
- The fucking gun is down.
- <i>Ammo, Larson.</i>

1563
01:16:25,945 --> 01:16:27,146
Goddamn it!

1564
01:16:27,179 --> 01:16:29,181
What the fuck
is going on, man?

1565
01:16:29,215 --> 01:16:31,817
<i>We need more ammo
at LRAS 2, ASAP.</i>

1566
01:16:34,553 --> 01:16:35,754
I'm good.

1567
01:16:39,959 --> 01:16:40,960
Fuck!

1568
01:17:33,279 --> 01:17:35,547
Open the fucking door, Mace.
Get it open.

1569
01:17:35,581 --> 01:17:37,850
Get the fuck in here, bro.

1570
01:17:37,883 --> 01:17:40,252
- I have the 240.
- 240's fucking down, bro.

1571
01:17:40,286 --> 01:17:43,155
Get the fuck in here
or get the fuck out!

1572
01:17:43,188 --> 01:17:44,957
- Ammo's...
- Close the door, close the door!

1573
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:46,292
I'm trying!

1574
01:17:46,325 --> 01:17:47,593
What else you got?

1575
01:17:47,627 --> 01:17:50,162
I got... Here you go.

1576
01:17:50,195 --> 01:17:51,363
Let him in, Carter.

1577
01:17:51,397 --> 01:17:53,832
- Who's that?
- Oh, shit, I heard you needed ammo!

1578
01:17:56,001 --> 01:17:57,970
- Come on, get in.
- Get in, get in!

1579
01:17:58,003 --> 01:17:59,271
Hurry up!

1580
01:17:59,305 --> 01:18:01,273
Let him in here!

1581
01:18:01,307 --> 01:18:03,208
Oh, fuck!

1582
01:18:03,242 --> 01:18:04,977
Nice of you to join
the party, Martin.

1583
01:18:05,010 --> 01:18:07,146
- You must like this. It's like Cinco de Mayo.
- RPG!

1584
01:18:10,983 --> 01:18:13,519
Oh, fuck!

1585
01:18:13,552 --> 01:18:15,521
Gallegos, how you
holding up over there?

1586
01:18:15,554 --> 01:18:16,588
<i>Ro?</i>

1587
01:18:16,622 --> 01:18:17,791
I don't know, man.

1588
01:18:17,823 --> 01:18:20,392
We got a shitload of gunfire
from the fucking south, man.

1589
01:18:20,426 --> 01:18:22,461
Well, other than that,
you're fine, right?

1590
01:18:22,494 --> 01:18:23,862
<i>Yeah, I guess.</i>

1591
01:18:23,896 --> 01:18:26,598
Look, I got
a machine gun set up.

1592
01:18:26,633 --> 01:18:28,367
You think you guys can make
it back to the barracks?

1593
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,602
I don't know if you can
lay down enough fucking fire,

1594
01:18:30,637 --> 01:18:32,304
but go for it. Over.

1595
01:18:32,338 --> 01:18:33,972
All right. Be ready.

1596
01:18:34,573 --> 01:18:35,642
Gregory, you ready?

1597
01:18:35,675 --> 01:18:37,076
- Good to go!
- Good.

1598
01:18:52,324 --> 01:18:53,325
Help!

1599
01:18:57,329 --> 01:18:58,397
RPG!

1600
01:19:06,639 --> 01:19:08,675
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1601
01:19:08,708 --> 01:19:10,175
Are you?

1602
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:13,445
Holy fuck, your arm!

1603
01:19:13,479 --> 01:19:15,347
Are you all right?

1604
01:19:15,381 --> 01:19:17,216
Yeah.
Displace to the trenches.

1605
01:19:17,249 --> 01:19:18,283
Are you sure?

1606
01:19:18,317 --> 01:19:19,952
Go! Go on, get out of here!

1607
01:19:25,958 --> 01:19:28,160
Hey, brother.

1608
01:19:28,193 --> 01:19:30,396
I'm sorry, I can't stay here.
They're all over us.

1609
01:19:31,363 --> 01:19:32,632
Thanks for trying, Ro.

1610
01:19:35,134 --> 01:19:36,502
We'll just chill here
for a while.

1611
01:19:36,535 --> 01:19:37,936
Hey, Ro.

1612
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:39,639
Keep everyone
the fuck away from here.

1613
01:19:39,672 --> 01:19:40,707
Fuck!

1614
01:19:46,278 --> 01:19:48,080
- Gregory.
- Yeah.

1615
01:19:48,113 --> 01:19:49,615
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1616
01:19:52,151 --> 01:19:53,619
The only way we're
getting those guys out there...

1617
01:19:53,653 --> 01:19:55,254
- Hey, Ro.
- We're gonna lose another vehicle.

1618
01:19:55,287 --> 01:19:56,255
- Ro, hear me out here, man.
- What?

1619
01:19:56,288 --> 01:19:59,124
LRAS 2 is stranded, okay?
They are inoperable.

1620
01:19:59,158 --> 01:20:00,592
I'm taking Truck I.

1621
01:20:00,627 --> 01:20:01,861
- I'm going with Faulkner.
- I'm going, too.

1622
01:20:01,895 --> 01:20:03,495
- We're gonna get those guys out of here.
- Yo, yo, yo, Ro.

1623
01:20:03,529 --> 01:20:05,230
Listen, Ro, we gotta get
this arm checked out.

1624
01:20:05,264 --> 01:20:06,666
I'm fine, I'm fine.
I just came from there.

1625
01:20:06,699 --> 01:20:08,267
- It's a cluster fuck.
- What, you wanna bleed out?

1626
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:11,403
Listen, Gallegos is telling
everybody to stay back

1627
01:20:11,437 --> 01:20:12,739
- for a fucking reason.
- Fuck that, man.

1628
01:20:12,772 --> 01:20:14,606
Dead bodies attract
more dead bodies.

1629
01:20:14,641 --> 01:20:17,075
We have two KIAs already, okay?

1630
01:20:17,109 --> 01:20:19,044
And we got Kirk in
the fucking aid station, man.

1631
01:20:19,077 --> 01:20:20,279
Kirk's in the fucking
aid station.

1632
01:20:20,312 --> 01:20:22,414
- Kirk?
- Yeah, fucking Kirk, Sergeant.

1633
01:20:24,349 --> 01:20:26,418
Okay, okay.

1634
01:20:28,454 --> 01:20:29,488
Check this.

1635
01:20:29,521 --> 01:20:32,024
You do this,
you do it smart, okay?

1636
01:20:32,057 --> 01:20:32,892
Fine.

1637
01:20:32,926 --> 01:20:34,661
Use that maintenance
shed for cover.

1638
01:20:34,694 --> 01:20:35,561
You don't go up the middle.

1639
01:20:35,594 --> 01:20:37,697
No, that's too far
out of the way, man.

1640
01:20:37,730 --> 01:20:40,700
Don't rush for failure.

1641
01:20:40,733 --> 01:20:42,702
Fine, okay, come on.
Let's go, Griffin.

1642
01:20:44,704 --> 01:20:47,573
Don't worry about that. Just set
it, set it, splint it, move on, okay?

1643
01:20:58,718 --> 01:21:00,285
I tried everything, man.

1644
01:21:00,319 --> 01:21:02,054
<i>Six, this is LRAS 1,</i>

1645
01:21:02,087 --> 01:21:03,690
<i>I got a fucking sniper
over here.</i>

1646
01:21:06,525 --> 01:21:08,093
I need your sniper rifle!

1647
01:21:09,561 --> 01:21:10,730
Where's that ammo?

1648
01:21:15,367 --> 01:21:16,769
Koppes!

1649
01:21:16,803 --> 01:21:18,705
Koppes, you okay?

1650
01:21:18,738 --> 01:21:20,372
Where's that sniper?

1651
01:21:20,405 --> 01:21:21,741
He's behind me.

1652
01:21:21,774 --> 01:21:23,442
Same guy who killed Scusa.

1653
01:21:23,475 --> 01:21:24,677
- Fuck.
- <i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

1654
01:21:24,711 --> 01:21:25,745
Shit.

1655
01:21:29,448 --> 01:21:32,117
12 o clock up on the treetops!

1656
01:21:37,322 --> 01:21:40,125
LRAS 1, do you copy?
LRAS 1, come in!

1657
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:41,560
Man, come here.

1658
01:21:43,595 --> 01:21:44,596
Oh, where...

1659
01:21:55,207 --> 01:21:56,809
Keep doing what you're doing.

1660
01:21:56,843 --> 01:21:58,811
- I'm up the ECP.
- I got you.

1661
01:21:58,845 --> 01:22:01,513
Sir, I hear them fucking
laughing, right outside...

1662
01:22:01,547 --> 01:22:03,816
Hey, hey, Claymores.

1663
01:22:03,850 --> 01:22:05,050
Roger.

1664
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:10,222
Fucking Claymores
aren't working.

1665
01:22:10,255 --> 01:22:11,590
Goddamned fucking Broward.

1666
01:22:11,623 --> 01:22:12,659
Hey, hey.

1667
01:22:12,692 --> 01:22:14,092
We may die today,

1668
01:22:14,126 --> 01:22:16,729
but let's kill as many of these
motherfuckers as we can, all right?

1669
01:22:16,763 --> 01:22:17,797
Roger that.

1670
01:22:17,830 --> 01:22:19,732
Frag these dudes,
frag these dudes.

1671
01:22:19,766 --> 01:22:20,800
Roger.

1672
01:22:20,833 --> 01:22:22,401
Smoke 'em for three.

1673
01:22:23,703 --> 01:22:26,605
One one-thousand,
two one-thousand, three.

1674
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:28,273
Eat shit, motherfucker!

1675
01:22:41,386 --> 01:22:42,421
Go, go, go!

1676
01:22:44,489 --> 01:22:47,860
- Friendlies! Friendlies!
- Friendlies, hold!

1677
01:22:47,894 --> 01:22:49,461
Fuck!

1678
01:22:50,897 --> 01:22:52,164
Find cover!

1679
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,704
You got ammo?

1680
01:22:57,737 --> 01:22:59,672
- Yeah, man.
- What are we doing, Sergeant?

1681
01:22:59,706 --> 01:23:00,807
You're gonna drive us
over to LRAS 2,

1682
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:02,541
and we're gonna get those
guys the fuck out of there.

1683
01:23:02,574 --> 01:23:03,843
Sergeant,
fucking that we are.

1684
01:23:03,876 --> 01:23:06,746
Quick, get up in the turret.
Close that fucking door.

1685
01:23:06,779 --> 01:23:08,213
Oh, shit!

1686
01:23:08,246 --> 01:23:09,414
Motherfucker.

1687
01:23:09,448 --> 01:23:12,284
Ammo.
Gallegos, this is Hardt.

1688
01:23:12,317 --> 01:23:13,853
We're driving to you now.
Stay put.

1689
01:23:13,886 --> 01:23:14,954
<i>We're gonna get
you out of there.</i>

1690
01:23:14,988 --> 01:23:17,422
Do not drive that fucking
truck over here, Hardt.

1691
01:23:17,456 --> 01:23:18,624
Do you hear me?

1692
01:23:18,658 --> 01:23:19,792
Keep fucking pushing!

1693
01:23:19,826 --> 01:23:20,860
<i>Hardt.</i>

1694
01:23:25,497 --> 01:23:27,399
Are you good?
Are you good?

1695
01:23:27,432 --> 01:23:29,434
Look at me.
Griff, get down!

1696
01:23:31,638 --> 01:23:33,305
Fuck, fuck.

1697
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:34,874
You good?

1698
01:23:34,907 --> 01:23:35,875
- Can you drive?
- Yeah.

1699
01:23:35,908 --> 01:23:39,311
Okay, okay, let's go.
We gotta get over there.

1700
01:23:39,344 --> 01:23:40,512
- You good?
- Yes.

1701
01:23:42,982 --> 01:23:45,384
We're fucking stuck.
I think we're on a bump.

1702
01:23:45,652 --> 01:23:46,653
Fuck!

1703
01:23:54,393 --> 01:23:55,427
<i>Hardt?</i>

1704
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:56,929
- <i>Hardt, are you good?</i>
- Fuck.

1705
01:23:56,963 --> 01:23:58,497
Gallegos, I'm sorry.

1706
01:23:58,530 --> 01:24:00,298
Fucking hell, Gallegos.

1707
01:24:00,332 --> 01:24:03,368
I'm sorry we couldn't help.
Fuck, I'm sorry.

1708
01:24:03,402 --> 01:24:04,436
Fuck!

1709
01:24:04,469 --> 01:24:07,406
I fucking told you, man!

1710
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:09,508
Will you please get
the fuck out of here, man?

1711
01:24:09,541 --> 01:24:11,410
Hang in there.

1712
01:24:11,443 --> 01:24:14,413
Sergeant, those
ANA don't look good.

1713
01:24:14,446 --> 01:24:16,816
- What?
- I think we got people in the fucking wire, man.

1714
01:24:16,849 --> 01:24:18,951
Jesus.
Those fucking Taliban.

1715
01:24:18,985 --> 01:24:21,319
Those fucking Taliban,
let's fucking kill those fuckers.

1716
01:24:21,353 --> 01:24:22,554
All right,
all right, all right.

1717
01:24:22,587 --> 01:24:24,289
Look at me.
This is what we're gonna do.

1718
01:24:24,322 --> 01:24:25,958
You two are gonna
make a run for it.

1719
01:24:25,992 --> 01:24:27,225
You're gonna run
like fucking hell.

1720
01:24:27,259 --> 01:24:29,494
I'm gonna get in this turret,
and I'm gonna cover fire you.

1721
01:24:29,528 --> 01:24:30,562
- Yes.
- Okay.

1722
01:24:30,595 --> 01:24:31,496
Yes, Sergeant!

1723
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:32,431
- I'll see you soon, guys.
- Fucking go.

1724
01:24:32,464 --> 01:24:33,866
- Let's go! Fuck, yeah!
- Fuck yeah!

1725
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:34,967
Fuck!

1726
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:49,716
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

1727
01:24:50,883 --> 01:24:52,350
Lakis, on me!

1728
01:24:56,689 --> 01:24:57,857
Friendly, friendly, friendly!

1729
01:24:57,890 --> 01:24:58,991
- Whoa, shit.
- Sergeant.

1730
01:24:59,025 --> 01:25:00,893
- Fuck!
- Charlie in the wire, Charlie in the wire!

1731
01:25:00,927 --> 01:25:03,696
- Who's Charlie?
- Fucking enemy, enemy in the wire!

1732
01:25:03,730 --> 01:25:05,430
<i>Holy fuck.</i>

1733
01:25:05,464 --> 01:25:07,633
<i>They've got an RPG
pointed right at me.</i>

1734
01:25:07,667 --> 01:25:09,468
Hardt?

1735
01:25:09,769 --> 01:25:11,269
Hardt?

1736
01:25:11,303 --> 01:25:13,505
Sarge, Griffin's dead, too.

1737
01:25:16,976 --> 01:25:18,410
These your ANA?

1738
01:25:18,443 --> 01:25:20,445
Not mine.

1739
01:25:20,479 --> 01:25:22,414
These cocksuckers
think they already won.

1740
01:25:24,751 --> 01:25:26,886
Hit 'em with the 203.

1741
01:25:30,723 --> 01:25:31,858
<i>This is X-ray.</i>

1742
01:25:31,891 --> 01:25:33,726
<i>Enemy in the wire,
enemy in the wire.</i>

1743
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,393
- <i>Everybody fall back.</i>
- You see?

1744
01:25:35,427 --> 01:25:36,629
They're fucking everywhere.

1745
01:25:36,662 --> 01:25:37,897
Sergeant, what the fuck
do we do?

1746
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:39,866
<i>Enemy in the
wire, enemy in the wire.</i>

1747
01:25:39,899 --> 01:25:41,533
<i>Everyone into Alamo position.</i>

1748
01:25:41,566 --> 01:25:43,268
<i>No, not today.</i>

1749
01:25:43,903 --> 01:25:45,604
- Romesha.
- Sergeant!

1750
01:25:45,638 --> 01:25:47,405
<i>This is Black Knight VI.</i>

1751
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:49,441
<i>Quick reaction force
has landed on the mountain.</i>

1752
01:25:49,474 --> 01:25:50,843
<i>We will be there
as soon as we can.</i>

1753
01:25:50,877 --> 01:25:51,978
<i>Out.</i>

1754
01:25:52,011 --> 01:25:53,079
Roger, Captain Portis.

1755
01:25:53,112 --> 01:25:54,914
We're gonna hang
onto what we can.

1756
01:25:54,947 --> 01:25:56,783
But it'd be really fucking
nice to see you, sir.

1757
01:25:57,582 --> 01:25:58,583
Over.

1758
01:25:59,886 --> 01:26:01,486
Guidons, guidons, guidons.

1759
01:26:01,988 --> 01:26:03,790
Alamo, Alamo, Alamo.

1760
01:26:03,823 --> 01:26:05,557
- Collapse to the core.
- Fuck that.

1761
01:26:07,994 --> 01:26:09,629
We need to retake this camp.

1762
01:26:09,662 --> 01:26:13,431
We don't have any mortars,
air support, the manpower.

1763
01:26:13,465 --> 01:26:15,034
We don't have
any accountability.

1764
01:26:15,067 --> 01:26:15,968
LT's right, Ro.

1765
01:26:16,002 --> 01:26:18,436
We need to dig in,
hold on to what we can,

1766
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:19,906
- and wait for support.
- Stop.

1767
01:26:20,873 --> 01:26:23,441
Helicopters alone won't save us.

1768
01:26:23,475 --> 01:26:25,645
Our ammo depot is 40 yards away.

1769
01:26:25,678 --> 01:26:28,346
It has everything we need
to stay in this fight.

1770
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:30,482
We start there,
and we plug our leaks.

1771
01:26:32,484 --> 01:26:33,820
Take back our front gate,

1772
01:26:33,853 --> 01:26:36,421
where the enemy
is just walking the fuck in.

1773
01:26:36,454 --> 01:26:38,758
And you get a machine gun
on that dining hall.

1774
01:26:41,828 --> 01:26:42,895
Everybody good?

1775
01:26:42,929 --> 01:26:45,097
- We lost power!
- Everybody good?

1776
01:26:45,131 --> 01:26:46,699
Hey, you good?

1777
01:26:47,365 --> 01:26:49,467
- LT.
- Are the radios up?

1778
01:26:49,501 --> 01:26:51,637
LT, our men
are trapped out here.

1779
01:26:53,706 --> 01:26:56,408
Let me do this, sir.

1780
01:26:58,177 --> 01:26:59,511
You're sure you
can make it happen?

1781
01:26:59,544 --> 01:27:01,781
Yes.

1782
01:27:01,814 --> 01:27:03,983
All right, if we're gonna do
this, we gotta call a net switch.

1783
01:27:04,016 --> 01:27:05,051
We got enemy in the wire.

1784
01:27:05,084 --> 01:27:06,853
They probably got
one of our radios.

1785
01:27:06,886 --> 01:27:08,120
The men out there
that are trapped,

1786
01:27:08,154 --> 01:27:09,689
they're gonna be cut off,
but we gotta do it.

1787
01:27:09,722 --> 01:27:10,823
All right?

1788
01:27:10,857 --> 01:27:11,824
- Check?
- Check.

1789
01:27:11,858 --> 01:27:15,962
Ro, wait for Hill's
machine gun, all right?

1790
01:27:15,995 --> 01:27:16,996
Check.

1791
01:27:22,034 --> 01:27:23,970
X-ray, X-ray, do you copy?

1792
01:27:25,938 --> 01:27:28,074
Motherfucking cocksucker!

1793
01:27:28,107 --> 01:27:29,175
What?

1794
01:27:29,208 --> 01:27:30,843
We lost comms, boys.

1795
01:27:30,877 --> 01:27:33,045
What's the plan, G?

1796
01:27:33,079 --> 01:27:35,681
- Gallegos, what are we doing, Sergeant?
- Okay, here's what we do.

1797
01:27:35,715 --> 01:27:37,515
We take cover at the rocks.

1798
01:27:37,549 --> 01:27:40,686
We go to latrines. We'll pass
latrines, past the laundry trailers,

1799
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:43,122
and then we haul ass to the TOC.

1800
01:27:43,155 --> 01:27:45,091
I'll hang back
and provide cover.

1801
01:27:45,124 --> 01:27:46,092
It's gonna take
a long fucking time.

1802
01:27:46,125 --> 01:27:47,627
- I'll cover with you.
- Everybody in?

1803
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:49,561
It's not up to us, man.
You're senior.

1804
01:27:49,594 --> 01:27:51,097
It's on you.
It's your decision.

1805
01:27:51,130 --> 01:27:52,899
Mace, keep the fuck up.

1806
01:27:52,932 --> 01:27:55,034
- Martin, you're gonna okay.
- Let's do it.

1807
01:27:55,067 --> 01:27:56,168
Come on, bitch.

1808
01:27:56,202 --> 01:27:58,771
- Carter!
- Is everybody fucking in?

1809
01:27:58,804 --> 01:28:00,172
We're going first, Carter.

1810
01:28:00,206 --> 01:28:02,440
- I love you, faggots. Let's go.
- Larson, Carter, you're out first.

1811
01:28:02,474 --> 01:28:03,976
- On my fire!
- Let's fucking move it.

1812
01:28:06,178 --> 01:28:07,179
Go!

1813
01:28:12,018 --> 01:28:13,185
RPG!

1814
01:28:15,721 --> 01:28:16,822
You guys okay?

1815
01:28:17,723 --> 01:28:19,125
Go, I got you covered!

1816
01:28:19,659 --> 01:28:21,794
Go! Get out of here!

1817
01:28:22,728 --> 01:28:23,763
Get up.

1818
01:28:23,796 --> 01:28:25,865
- Mace is hurt, guys.
- We're on you, we're on you.

1819
01:28:25,898 --> 01:28:27,033
- Come on!
- Fast.

1820
01:28:27,066 --> 01:28:28,935
Cover me!

1821
01:28:28,968 --> 01:28:31,170
Carter, cover me!

1822
01:28:31,203 --> 01:28:33,706
Shit, these motherfuckers!

1823
01:28:33,739 --> 01:28:34,907
Go!

1824
01:28:34,941 --> 01:28:36,208
Quit dragging
your ass, shit!

1825
01:28:38,978 --> 01:28:40,646
Come on, man.
We're nearly there.

1826
01:28:42,014 --> 01:28:43,182
Gallegos!

1827
01:28:44,850 --> 01:28:45,885
I'm good.

1828
01:28:48,321 --> 01:28:50,455
Motherfuckers!

1829
01:28:52,624 --> 01:28:54,760
Gallegos is down!

1830
01:28:54,794 --> 01:28:56,228
How bad is it?

1831
01:28:56,262 --> 01:28:57,730
Hey, watch your six!

1832
01:28:59,999 --> 01:29:01,499
Coming to you!

1833
01:29:01,533 --> 01:29:02,567
Carter!

1834
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:03,903
Carter, get in the truck!

1835
01:29:08,007 --> 01:29:09,574
What the fuck happened
to Mace and Martin?

1836
01:29:09,607 --> 01:29:10,710
Fuck!

1837
01:29:10,743 --> 01:29:12,244
What happened to
Mace and Martin?

1838
01:29:12,278 --> 01:29:14,080
I don't know!

1839
01:29:14,113 --> 01:29:17,717
Hey, Red Platoon,
I need volunteers.

1840
01:29:19,118 --> 01:29:20,219
We're taking this bitch back.

1841
01:29:20,753 --> 01:29:21,988
Hell yeah, Ro.

1842
01:29:22,021 --> 01:29:23,055
Count me in.

1843
01:29:23,089 --> 01:29:24,290
- You got me?
- Good.

1844
01:29:24,323 --> 01:29:25,992
Gregory?

1845
01:29:26,025 --> 01:29:27,626
I don't think I
can make it, Ro.

1846
01:29:28,794 --> 01:29:31,263
- I've got his gun.
- Jones, good man.

1847
01:29:31,297 --> 01:29:33,565
Miller, Dannelley, let's go.

1848
01:29:36,068 --> 01:29:38,671
Motherfuck...

1849
01:29:39,839 --> 01:29:42,675
Ow, mother... Shit.

1850
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:54,787
Red II, X-ray,
where the fuck's that machine gun?

1851
01:29:54,820 --> 01:29:56,055
The machine gun is on its way.

1852
01:29:56,088 --> 01:29:57,156
<i>Just hang on.</i>

1853
01:30:01,761 --> 01:30:02,895
Shit. Shit.

1854
01:30:02,928 --> 01:30:04,030
X-ray, we gotta move.

1855
01:30:04,063 --> 01:30:05,798
We gotta get to
the front gate now.

1856
01:30:05,831 --> 01:30:07,033
<i>They're right on top of us.</i>

1857
01:30:07,066 --> 01:30:08,834
Negative, Red II.
Hold your position.

1858
01:30:08,868 --> 01:30:09,835
Wait for cover fire.

1859
01:30:09,869 --> 01:30:11,771
Sorry, what was that?
You're coming in broken.

1860
01:30:11,804 --> 01:30:13,072
<i>Goddamn it, Ro.</i>

1861
01:30:13,105 --> 01:30:14,106
No.

1862
01:30:15,074 --> 01:30:16,142
Oh, fuck.

1863
01:30:16,742 --> 01:30:18,310
All right, guys. Let's go.

1864
01:30:21,981 --> 01:30:23,215
I've never killed
anyone before.

1865
01:30:26,752 --> 01:30:27,887
Me too.

1866
01:30:29,221 --> 01:30:31,223
- You got any smokes in that?
- What?

1867
01:30:31,257 --> 01:30:32,324
A pack of cigarettes.

1868
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:35,795
Wouldn't you be lucky?

1869
01:30:42,835 --> 01:30:45,037
- Fuck. Mace.
- Help!

1870
01:30:45,071 --> 01:30:46,839
Mace, he's crawling to us.

1871
01:30:46,872 --> 01:30:49,909
- Help me, please.
- Shit, it's Mace!

1872
01:30:49,942 --> 01:30:51,077
He's crawling to us.

1873
01:30:52,078 --> 01:30:53,646
Mace is calling at us!

1874
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:54,980
Tell him to get behind
that fucking rock for cover.

1875
01:30:55,014 --> 01:30:57,016
- Mace!
- Behind the rock!

1876
01:30:57,049 --> 01:30:58,350
Get the rock...
Get cover behind the rock!

1877
01:30:58,384 --> 01:31:00,319
We'll come after
you in a second!

1878
01:31:00,352 --> 01:31:01,353
Fuck!

1879
01:31:03,189 --> 01:31:04,223
He's okay, man.
He has cover.

1880
01:31:04,256 --> 01:31:06,258
He's fucking bleeding.
He's fucking bleeding out.

1881
01:31:06,292 --> 01:31:08,227
Carter, he has cover.

1882
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:09,528
- Carter, what are you doing?
- Take cover.

1883
01:31:09,562 --> 01:31:12,698
- I'm going out there.
- Carter, what the fuck are you doing?

1884
01:31:12,731 --> 01:31:13,866
Carter!

1885
01:31:13,899 --> 01:31:15,734
- What are you fucking doing, man?
- What the fuck?

1886
01:31:15,768 --> 01:31:17,336
What do you mean,
what the fuck am I doing?

1887
01:31:17,369 --> 01:31:18,771
He's bleeding out!

1888
01:31:18,804 --> 01:31:20,406
Dude, he has
fucking cover there.

1889
01:31:20,439 --> 01:31:22,141
<i>We have cover here.</i>

1890
01:31:22,174 --> 01:31:24,210
<i>There are only two of us!</i>

1891
01:31:24,243 --> 01:31:26,178
You wanna fucking die
trying to save him?

1892
01:31:26,212 --> 01:31:28,347
Mace, wait, Mace, wait!

1893
01:31:37,189 --> 01:31:39,792
Jones, Dannelley, Lakis, ammo.

1894
01:31:40,025 --> 01:31:41,093
Ras.

1895
01:31:50,402 --> 01:31:51,904
Hey, 203!

1896
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:03,282
Dannelley, blind spot!

1897
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:07,753
You okay?

1898
01:32:07,786 --> 01:32:09,788
Aid station, go!

1899
01:32:09,822 --> 01:32:11,690
Ras, let's get these fuckers!

1900
01:32:17,329 --> 01:32:18,464
Go.

1901
01:32:18,497 --> 01:32:21,700
You keep that gun up until
we get the front gate, okay?

1902
01:32:21,734 --> 01:32:24,336
We take back the front gate,
we take back this outpost.

1903
01:32:24,370 --> 01:32:25,538
Love the pressure, Ro.

1904
01:32:25,571 --> 01:32:28,140
This net, any station, this
net, this is Red Dragon over.

1905
01:32:28,174 --> 01:32:29,375
I got half a mag left.

1906
01:32:29,608 --> 01:32:30,843
You?

1907
01:32:32,077 --> 01:32:33,412
Take some of mine.

1908
01:32:34,413 --> 01:32:35,381
Fuck.

1909
01:32:35,414 --> 01:32:37,416
Any station this net,
any station this net,

1910
01:32:37,449 --> 01:32:38,817
this is Red Dragon, over.

1911
01:32:38,851 --> 01:32:40,186
Think there's
any one of us alive?

1912
01:32:41,253 --> 01:32:43,022
Think we're it, huh?

1913
01:32:43,689 --> 01:32:45,291
I don't know, man. Fuck this!

1914
01:32:45,324 --> 01:32:48,093
I can get to him.
Larson, I can fucking get to him.

1915
01:32:48,127 --> 01:32:51,363
- He's right fucking there.
- Dead bodies attract dead bodies, all right?

1916
01:32:51,397 --> 01:32:52,998
I don't want you
trying to win a fucking medal.

1917
01:32:54,767 --> 01:32:57,736
Hey, Mace, stay right there,
don't fucking move!

1918
01:32:57,770 --> 01:32:59,305
We're coming as soon as we can!

1919
01:32:59,338 --> 01:33:01,273
Fuck, fuck.

1920
01:33:02,942 --> 01:33:05,444
Sergeant, Sergeant, Sergeant.

1921
01:33:05,477 --> 01:33:07,213
- Carter, please.
- Sergeant.

1922
01:33:07,246 --> 01:33:09,114
God, stop talking.

1923
01:33:09,882 --> 01:33:10,883
Stop.

1924
01:33:12,551 --> 01:33:13,986
What are you gonna do
when you get to him?

1925
01:33:14,019 --> 01:33:15,955
I'm gonna render
him fucking aid, man.

1926
01:33:15,988 --> 01:33:17,523
Where are you gonna take him?

1927
01:33:17,556 --> 01:33:20,092
His best chance
is in here with us.

1928
01:33:20,125 --> 01:33:21,860
- I agree. I agree.
- Agreed?

1929
01:33:21,894 --> 01:33:22,895
So?

1930
01:33:24,029 --> 01:33:25,898
I'll cover you, okay?

1931
01:33:25,931 --> 01:33:27,266
- Thank you.
- All right?

1932
01:33:27,299 --> 01:33:29,001
- Thank you.
- Take a fucking breath.

1933
01:33:29,034 --> 01:33:30,436
All right?

1934
01:33:30,469 --> 01:33:32,037
Conserve your fucking ammo.

1935
01:33:33,906 --> 01:33:35,407
Are you ready?

1936
01:33:35,441 --> 01:33:37,876
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1937
01:33:51,257 --> 01:33:52,424
You all right, Mace?

1938
01:33:52,458 --> 01:33:54,426
My ankle is fucked up.

1939
01:33:59,164 --> 01:34:00,432
It's okay.

1940
01:34:00,466 --> 01:34:04,503
- Carter, is he alive?
- Oh, baby, you're looking good.

1941
01:34:04,536 --> 01:34:06,238
Fuck you,
gay motherfucker.

1942
01:34:06,272 --> 01:34:08,407
All right, man, just
as soon as I can find it.

1943
01:34:10,309 --> 01:34:12,077
- Hang with me.
- Bunch of fucking...

1944
01:34:12,111 --> 01:34:13,212
Hang with me.

1945
01:34:13,245 --> 01:34:14,580
Ah, this is nothing, man.

1946
01:34:14,613 --> 01:34:16,081
Where's your nuts,
motherfucker?

1947
01:34:16,115 --> 01:34:17,283
I know.

1948
01:34:17,316 --> 01:34:18,350
I know, baby.

1949
01:34:18,384 --> 01:34:19,385
Here we go.

1950
01:34:21,487 --> 01:34:23,188
Come on,
you a man or not?

1951
01:34:23,222 --> 01:34:25,190
Huh? You got it.

1952
01:34:25,224 --> 01:34:27,059
There you go.

1953
01:34:27,092 --> 01:34:28,294
There you go, brother.

1954
01:34:30,162 --> 01:34:31,196
I know!

1955
01:34:36,101 --> 01:34:38,237
I think Sergeant
Gallegos is dead.

1956
01:34:39,471 --> 01:34:41,307
Fuck.

1957
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:43,342
Hey, but you're
not gonna die, okay?

1958
01:34:43,375 --> 01:34:45,944
- You stay with me, okay?
- I'm gonna fucking die, Carter.

1959
01:34:45,978 --> 01:34:47,513
No, you're not.
No, you're not, fucker.

1960
01:34:47,546 --> 01:34:49,048
You're dying of
cancer, remember?

1961
01:34:49,081 --> 01:34:50,616
You're dying of fucking cancer.

1962
01:34:50,650 --> 01:34:52,251
Now, come on.

1963
01:34:52,284 --> 01:34:53,919
Put your arms around me.

1964
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:55,354
- Put your arms...
- Give me a fucking sec!

1965
01:34:55,387 --> 01:34:57,056
Put your arms around me!

1966
01:34:57,089 --> 01:34:58,624
Just like we're dancing.

1967
01:34:58,658 --> 01:34:59,992
Carter, is he okay?

1968
01:35:06,031 --> 01:35:07,266
Fat hobbit fuck.

1969
01:35:07,299 --> 01:35:10,002
Find yourself
a fucking parade.

1970
01:35:12,371 --> 01:35:15,040
- Larson!
- Put him in the front!

1971
01:35:17,042 --> 01:35:18,444
Get in the truck.
I'll cover you!

1972
01:35:19,278 --> 01:35:20,379
Thanks!

1973
01:35:23,182 --> 01:35:25,884
- Get in the truck!
- Fuck me.

1974
01:35:29,588 --> 01:35:31,223
Mace!

1975
01:35:31,256 --> 01:35:32,324
Mace!

1976
01:35:32,624 --> 01:35:34,259
Mace!

1977
01:35:34,293 --> 01:35:36,228
- Mace!
- You guys got a cigarette?

1978
01:35:40,299 --> 01:35:41,900
Ras, 203.

1979
01:35:42,334 --> 01:35:44,002
Stop, Ras.

1980
01:35:53,512 --> 01:35:54,580
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

1981
01:35:56,081 --> 01:35:58,450
Friendly, friendly, friendly.

1982
01:35:59,618 --> 01:36:03,122
Geez, Ras, hit him
with a CS grenade?

1983
01:36:03,155 --> 01:36:05,023
No, high explosive, standard.

1984
01:36:05,057 --> 01:36:07,192
Shit. Get the fire extinguisher.
Good shot.

1985
01:36:07,226 --> 01:36:08,227
Go.

1986
01:36:09,361 --> 01:36:10,462
ECP clear.

1987
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:11,530
Take the guards out.

1988
01:36:11,563 --> 01:36:13,332
Go.

1989
01:36:13,365 --> 01:36:15,534
Just a little
air support now, boys.

1990
01:36:21,073 --> 01:36:23,542
X-ray, we're at the front gate.
No one's getting in here.

1991
01:36:31,417 --> 01:36:32,451
Oh, shit.

1992
01:36:37,456 --> 01:36:40,660
Oh. Oh, come on,
come on.

1993
01:36:40,693 --> 01:36:42,194
Oh, shit.
There's too many.

1994
01:36:43,562 --> 01:36:44,697

your service, ma'am.

Hey.

1999
01:37:33,345 --> 01:37:34,613
He's not gonna make it.

2000
01:37:34,647 --> 01:37:36,014
Yeah, I know.

2001
01:37:36,048 --> 01:37:37,082
So I'm gonna go on recon.

2002
01:37:37,115 --> 01:37:38,450
If I'm not back in
10 minutes,

2003
01:37:38,484 --> 01:37:40,219
then I made it
or don't worry about me.

2004
01:37:40,252 --> 01:37:41,453
Eyes open.

2005
01:37:41,487 --> 01:37:42,521
You got me?

2006
01:37:42,554 --> 01:37:43,656
Hm, yeah. fuck.

2007
01:37:46,358 --> 01:37:47,392
Fuck.

2008
01:37:48,494 --> 01:37:49,528
Yo, Mace.

2009
01:37:49,561 --> 01:37:51,029
No, fucking what?

2010
01:37:51,063 --> 01:37:53,599
- Gun to your head.
- Gun to my head?

2011
01:37:53,633 --> 01:37:55,400
Gun to your head, a guy you gotta fuck.
Who is it?

2012
01:37:55,434 --> 01:37:56,568
Gun to your head.

2013
01:37:56,602 --> 01:37:58,036
- Oh, fuck.
- Which guy?

2014
01:37:58,070 --> 01:37:59,104
Fucking, uh...

2015
01:38:38,477 --> 01:38:41,179
This is Blue Four Golf.
Is anyone still alive?

2016
01:38:44,316 --> 01:38:46,084
<i>Request
permission to engage up ahead.</i>

2017

Keep your eyes open, Mace.
Keep them open.

2018
01:38:50,389 --> 01:38:51,791
Mace, look, look.

2019
01:38:51,824 --> 01:38:52,825
Carter.

2020
01:38:53,626 --> 01:38:55,160
American voices.

2021
01:38:55,193 --> 01:38:56,361
I heard American voices!

2022
01:38:56,395 --> 01:38:58,230
Get in here,
get in here, get in here!

2023
01:38:58,263 --> 01:38:59,264
You hear that, Mace?

2024
01:38:59,298 --> 01:39:00,733
X-ray, X-ray,
this is Red Dragon, over.

2025
01:39:00,767 --> 01:39:02,501
This is the high
point right there.

2026
01:39:03,703 --> 01:39:05,370
Red Dragon, go ahead.
What's going on?

2027
01:39:05,404 --> 01:39:07,472
We're still trapped in LRAS 2.

2028
01:39:08,173 --> 01:39:09,441
Gallegos is KIA.

2029
01:39:09,474 --> 01:39:10,710
Hardt's missing.

2030
01:39:10,743 --> 01:39:12,311
Carter and I are okay.

2031
01:39:12,344 --> 01:39:13,478
- Okay?
- And Mace is pretty jacked up.

2032
01:39:13,512 --> 01:39:14,781
- You look me in the fucking eye.
- He's hurting surgical.

2033
01:39:14,814 --> 01:39:16,883
He's gonna need to get the aid
station as soon as possible.

2034
01:39:16,916 --> 01:39:19,384
<i>We need some serious
covering fire, over.</i>

2035
01:39:19,418 --> 01:39:21,320
Glad to hear you boys
are still breathing.

2036
01:39:21,353 --> 01:39:22,789
<i>I'm gonna wrangle
you some cover.</i>

2037
01:39:24,323 --> 01:39:26,425
We got a B1 bomber
coming in from Qatar.

2038
01:39:26,458 --> 01:39:29,294
When it drops its payload,
it's gonna be a son of a bitch.

2039
01:39:29,328 --> 01:39:32,865
When it hits, I need every
weapon we have on camp.

2040
01:39:32,899 --> 01:39:34,867
LRAS 2, that ought to be
enough cover for you guys

2041
01:39:34,901 --> 01:39:36,134

Get your boys down.</i>

2050
01:39:55,722 --> 01:39:57,222
<i>We're gonna get close.</i>

2051
01:39:57,255 --> 01:39:59,191
- Carter, good luck, man.
- Five, four...

2052
01:39:59,224 --> 01:40:00,459
- Mace, stay with us.
- ...three...

2053
01:40:00,492 --> 01:40:02,227
...two, one.

2054
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:03,328
You're
gonna be all right.

2055
01:40:04,864 --> 01:40:06,833
- Go, go, go!
- Let's go!

2056
01:40:06,866 --> 01:40:08,668
Hang the fuck on, Mace!

2057
01:40:08,701 --> 01:40:10,335
We're hauling fucking ass!

2058
01:40:13,438 --> 01:40:14,539
Whoa!

2059
01:40:14,573 --> 01:40:15,642
There's Griffin!

2060
01:40:22,314 --> 01:40:23,315
Come on!

2061
01:40:24,249 --> 01:40:25,283
Move!

2062
01:40:25,317 --> 01:40:26,653
Come on!

2063
01:40:26,686 --> 01:40:27,887
You got it, Carter.
Keep going.

2064
01:40:42,501 --> 01:40:43,703
We're coming in!

2065
01:40:44,871 --> 01:40:46,806
We got Mace!
We're coming in!

2066
01:40:48,373 --> 01:40:49,709
Make way!

2067
01:40:49,742 --> 01:40:50,877
Make way!

2068
01:40:52,879 --> 01:40:54,747
Carter, let go.
Let go, Carter.

2069
01:40:54,781 --> 01:40:56,916
Carter! Let go, Carter!

2070
01:41:06,959 --> 01:41:07,827
Stay with us.

2071
01:41:07,860 --> 01:41:10,863
I put the tourniquet
on 15 minutes ago.

2072
01:41:11,931 --> 01:41:14,466
He's...
He's been bleeding...

2073
01:41:14,499 --> 01:41:16,334
15 minutes.

2074
01:41:16,368 --> 01:41:17,770
45.

2075
01:41:17,804 --> 01:41:20,272
He's been bleeding out
for 45 minutes.

2076
01:41:26,278 --> 01:41:27,546
Come on, Mace, hang in there.

2077
01:41:27,579 --> 01:41:29,514
Hang in there, Mace!

2078
01:41:32,617 --> 01:41:34,519
Fuck yeah,
you beautiful fuckers!

2079
01:41:35,487 --> 01:41:36,588
Bird is coming in!

2080
01:41:37,622 --> 01:41:39,391
Larson!
Damn glad to see you.

2081
01:41:39,424 --> 01:41:40,559
- Yellow.
- I love you, too, man.

2082
01:41:40,592 --> 01:41:42,594
Activity on the North face.

2083
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:44,964
Hardt and Martin are missing.

2084
01:41:44,997 --> 01:41:46,733
Griffin and Gallegos are KIA.

2085
01:41:49,035 --> 01:41:51,037
Hey, you know where they are?

2086
01:41:51,070 --> 01:41:53,371
Got a stent
in your carotid artery.

2087
01:41:53,405 --> 01:41:55,440
His body's sending all his
blood to his vital organs.

2088
01:41:55,474 --> 01:41:57,442
- That's good.
- No, no, no, stay with me.

2089
01:41:57,476 --> 01:41:58,811
Hey, Cordova,
that's good, right?

2090
01:41:58,845 --> 01:41:59,979
No, it's not.
His blood pressure's too weak.

2091
01:42:00,012 --> 01:42:01,546
If he doesn't get out of
this valley in the next hour,

2092
01:42:01,580 --> 01:42:02,782
he won't make it.

2093
01:42:02,815 --> 01:42:04,483
And there's no birds getting
in here till after nightfall.

2094
01:42:06,986 --> 01:42:08,420
It's time to get radical.

2095
01:42:08,453 --> 01:42:09,689
As you can hear,
air support is out there,

2096
01:42:09,722 --> 01:42:12,591
doing the Lord's
fucking work, right?

2097
01:42:12,624 --> 01:42:14,559
Captain Portis and the quick
reaction force is on their way.

2098
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:16,696
We're almost done, guys.

2099
01:42:20,398 --> 01:42:21,968
Jesus Christ.

2100
01:42:26,404 --> 01:42:28,708
X-ray, this is Black
Knights VI with the QRF.

2101
01:42:28,741 --> 01:42:30,275
Got eyes on the COP, over.

2102
01:42:31,476 --> 01:42:32,678
<i>Roger that, sir.</i>

2103
01:42:32,712 --> 01:42:33,746
<i>We'll see you soon.</i>

2104
01:42:42,054 --> 01:42:43,656
Bone One Eight, you have
eyes on my position?

2105
01:42:43,689 --> 01:42:44,791
<i>I copy.</i>

2106
01:42:45,758 --> 01:42:47,693
I think I see the last of 'em.

2107
01:42:47,727 --> 01:42:50,328
500 meters north, 50 degrees.

2108
01:42:50,362 --> 01:42:51,563
Let's end this thing.

2109
01:42:51,596 --> 01:42:52,632
<i>Roger that.</i>

2110
01:43:22,527 --> 01:43:23,729
Glad they're on our side.

2111
01:43:26,699 --> 01:43:27,767
A+ve.

2112
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:29,467
I'm A+ve.
I'm A+ve.

2113
01:43:29,501 --> 01:43:31,536
Hey, Doc. What Does that mean?
What's going on?

2114
01:43:31,570 --> 01:43:33,405
We can't perform
surgery on him here.

2115
01:43:33,438 --> 01:43:35,041
And what the fuck
does that mean?

2116
01:43:35,074 --> 01:43:37,375
Medevac won't be here
for a few hours,

2117
01:43:37,409 --> 01:43:39,578
which means he needs fresh blood
if he wants to live.

2118
01:43:39,611 --> 01:43:40,646
This is the only
thing we can do.

2119
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:41,848
We're not sterile,
and we can't test for disease.

2120
01:43:41,881 --> 01:43:44,416
- Okay.
- Our fresh blood is all we can do to save him.

2121
01:43:44,449 --> 01:43:45,651
- Fuck.
- Come on.

2122
01:43:45,685 --> 01:43:46,986
Hey, Mace.

2123
01:43:47,019 --> 01:43:47,987
- Mace, come on. Stick with me.
- You'll be good, buddy.

2124
01:43:48,020 --> 01:43:48,955
You might be a little
light in the loafers,

2125
01:43:48,988 --> 01:43:51,157
because it's fucking
officer blood, but...

2126
01:43:51,190 --> 01:43:52,925
All right, I need you to
put a call in on the radio.

2127
01:43:52,959 --> 01:43:54,526
Everybody with A+ve blood

2128
01:43:54,559 --> 01:43:55,795
needs to get their ass
to the aid station, okay?

2129
01:43:55,828 --> 01:43:57,964
We need as much fucking
blood as we can get.

2130
01:44:07,173 --> 01:44:08,941
Fuck, Mohammed.

2131
01:44:08,975 --> 01:44:10,375
Get out of there. Go on.

2132
01:44:13,646 --> 01:44:15,681
I told you the
Taliban would attack.

2133
01:44:15,715 --> 01:44:17,884
- I know my country.
- All right, go, go, go.

2134
01:44:17,917 --> 01:44:19,584
Heard on the radio
you guys need blood.

2135
01:44:19,618 --> 01:44:21,020
Yeah, we need a second bag.
You A+ve?

2136
01:44:21,053 --> 01:44:22,755
- A-fucking-positive.
- All right, give me this.

2137
01:44:23,155 --> 01:44:24,156
All right.

2138
01:44:24,190 --> 01:44:25,523
- You all right, Mace?
- Stay with me, buddy.

2139
01:44:25,557 --> 01:44:26,893
You all right, Mace?

2140
01:44:26,926 --> 01:44:28,060
- We're gonna get you medevac soon, Mace.
- How's he doing?

2141
01:44:28,895 --> 01:44:30,863
We fucking won, man.
We fucking won.

2142
01:44:44,143 --> 01:44:45,811
We'll get you back home
to Amanda and Mac, man.

2143
01:44:45,845 --> 01:44:46,946
Come on, you're good.

2144
01:44:46,979 --> 01:44:48,147
Come on, motherfucker.

2145
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:49,849
Let's go.

2146
01:44:49,882 --> 01:44:50,917
Come on.
You got him?

2147
01:44:50,950 --> 01:44:51,984
- You got him?
- Yeah.

2148
01:44:52,018 --> 01:44:54,053
Come on, bro.
Come on, bro.

2149
01:44:54,086 --> 01:44:55,755
Come on, bro.
You're good, man.

2150
01:45:16,709 --> 01:45:17,944
I'm Lieutenant Bundermann.

2151
01:45:17,977 --> 01:45:19,078
Captain Portis.

2152
01:45:19,111 --> 01:45:20,512
Welcome to Outpost
Keating, sir.

2153
01:45:22,882 --> 01:45:25,583
All your men
accounted for, Lieutenant?

2154
01:45:25,617 --> 01:45:30,555
27 wounded, seven dead,
a dozen ANA severely wounded.

2155
01:45:31,691 --> 01:45:33,025
Specialist Mace
is pretty banged up.

2156
01:45:33,059 --> 01:45:35,795
The medics are...
They're optimistic, sir.

2157
01:45:38,297 --> 01:45:39,865
He's got all
of our blood in him.

2158
01:45:46,604 --> 01:45:48,506
I'm sorry, sir.
I know now's not the time.

2159
01:45:51,543 --> 01:45:52,645
It is the time.

2160
01:45:54,213 --> 01:45:57,615
Lieutenant, you did
a hell of a job here.

2161
01:45:59,218 --> 01:46:00,920
You took fucking command.

2162
01:46:07,026 --> 01:46:08,728
What do you
wanna salvage, sir?

2163
01:46:10,029 --> 01:46:11,163
Nothing.

2164
01:46:13,265 --> 01:46:16,268
Tomorrow, we blow this shithole
off the face of the earth.

2165
01:46:22,208 --> 01:46:23,709
That Hardt?

2166
01:46:23,743 --> 01:46:24,777
Yes, Sergeant.

2167
01:46:32,318 --> 01:46:33,518
Sergeant?

2168
01:46:35,821 --> 01:46:36,856
Yeah, okay.

2169
01:47:03,849 --> 01:47:04,917

01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:22,661
What?

2188
01:48:23,729 --> 01:48:25,164
Be good!

2189
01:48:28,033 --> 01:48:29,034
Carter!

2190
01:48:30,803 --> 01:48:31,871
Carter, let's go.

2191
01:48:33,472 --> 01:48:35,074
Faulkner, Ro, you
guys are injured.

2192
01:48:35,107 --> 01:48:37,176
I need you to get
on that bird and leave tonight.

2193
01:48:37,209 --> 01:48:40,212
I wanna leave with everybody
else, sir, if that's okay.

2194
01:48:40,246 --> 01:48:41,347
We're good, sir.

2195
01:49:28,961 --> 01:49:30,329
Yo, run the line
all the way.

2196
01:49:32,898 --> 01:49:35,768
It won't fit on the truck,
you put it where it'll burn.

2197
01:50:06,198 --> 01:50:07,433
Yeah, roger.

2198
01:50:13,272 --> 01:50:14,907
Mace didn't make it.

2199
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:15,941
What?

2200
01:50:16,976 --> 01:50:18,377
Mace didn't make it!

2201
01:51:24,443 --> 01:51:25,444
<i>Hello?</i>

2202
01:51:28,147 --> 01:51:30,816
<i>Hello? Hon, is...
Is that you?</i>

2203
01:51:33,886 --> 01:51:35,387
I'm happy you came to talk.

2204
01:51:37,523 --> 01:51:39,224
Well, Sergeant Hal
said I had to.

2205
01:51:40,292 --> 01:51:41,393
Well, you don't have to.

2206
01:51:41,427 --> 01:51:43,862
- Only if you want to.
- He said I needed to.

2207
01:51:46,165 --> 01:51:47,266
Mm.

2208
01:51:48,567 --> 01:51:49,902
You're very pretty.

2209
01:51:49,935 --> 01:51:50,969
Thank you.

2210
01:51:53,572 --> 01:51:55,140
So can you tell
me what happened?

2211
01:52:00,446 --> 01:52:01,914
What? When?

2212
01:52:02,682 --> 01:52:03,982
During the battle.

2213
01:52:05,652 --> 01:52:06,952
What... What about it?

2214
01:52:09,188 --> 01:52:11,658
Do you remember what happened
with you in the battle?

2215
01:52:11,691 --> 01:52:12,991
Mm-hm.

2216
01:52:24,370 --> 01:52:25,437
I didn't save...

2217
01:52:26,238 --> 01:52:27,506
I didn't save him.

2218
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:29,274
Who?

2219
01:52:31,343 --> 01:52:32,978
Mace.

2220
01:52:33,011 --> 01:52:35,481
Mace, he was your friend.

2221
01:52:35,514 --> 01:52:37,049
No.

2222
01:52:38,150 --> 01:52:39,585
No, he was not.

2223
01:52:48,527 --> 01:52:51,263
- I'm scared.
- I know.

2224
01:52:51,296 --> 01:52:54,099
It's scary, but I promise
it will help to talk about it.

2225
01:52:56,568 --> 01:52:57,670
I'm sorry.

2226
01:52:57,704 --> 01:52:59,972
- It's okay.
- Give me a sec.

2227
01:53:00,572 --> 01:53:01,573
It's okay.

2228
01:53:09,047 --> 01:53:11,550
Ty, can you breathe for me?

2229
01:53:14,620 --> 01:53:15,954
In and out.

2230
01:53:17,322 --> 01:53:18,323
I'm breathing.

2231
01:53:19,358 --> 01:53:21,260
I'm breathing.

2232
01:53:21,293 --> 01:53:23,195
I'm...

2233
01:53:24,396 --> 01:53:25,397
I'm breathing.

2268
01:57:04,651 --> 01:57:05,952
He was on his...

2269
01:57:05,985 --> 01:57:09,789
he was on his forearms,
and his elbows, and he went behind.

2270
01:57:09,822 --> 01:57:13,291
He went towards...
towards Gallegos.

2271
01:57:13,325 --> 01:57:15,928
And that's when I said, "Hey,
Sergeant Larson, Mace is alive.

2272
01:57:15,962 --> 01:57:17,930
"I can get to him.
He's right there."

2273
01:57:17,964 --> 01:57:20,465
And, uh, I think he looked,
and he says,

2274
01:57:20,499 --> 01:57:21,934
"No, you can't get to him."

2275
01:57:21,968 --> 01:57:23,602
I say, "No, he's right there.
I can get to him."

2276
01:57:23,636 --> 01:57:25,705
And he says,
"You're no good to him dead."

2277
01:57:25,738 --> 01:57:27,406
And, uh... and I knew.

2278
01:57:27,439 --> 01:57:31,744
I knew he was right, but it...
It ate me up so bad.

2279
01:57:34,714 --> 01:57:35,848
I need a break.
Hold on.

2280
01:57:35,882 --> 01:57:36,883
Yeah.

2281
01:57:38,583 --> 01:57:39,719
Take as much time as you need.

2282
01:57:44,957 --> 01:57:48,460
Finished out the belt
and scurried on back,

2283
01:57:49,996 --> 01:57:52,497
and I called Gallegos
and told him...

2284
01:58:00,572 --> 01:58:01,606
I told him I was sorry.

2285
01:58:03,843 --> 01:58:07,612
Clint, you're one guy with no
ammunition, facing 400 Taliban,

2286
01:58:07,647 --> 01:58:08,948
all of whom have
the high ground.

2287
01:58:11,316 --> 01:58:12,584
You could always try,
though.

2288
01:58:15,287 --> 01:58:19,291
We'd landed, uh,
at nighttime,

2289
01:58:19,324 --> 01:58:20,392
but even at night,

2290
01:58:20,425 --> 01:58:23,261
you could tell the
silhouettes of the mountain

2291
01:58:23,295 --> 01:58:24,797
and the sky were...

2292
01:58:27,432 --> 01:58:29,001
Did not give us...
It did not give you

2293
01:58:29,035 --> 01:58:30,970
a very good sense of
"this is a safe place."

2294
01:58:31,003 --> 01:58:33,538
It gave me a quick
sense of impending doom,

2295
01:58:33,572 --> 01:58:35,041
that it was just
a matter of time

2296
01:58:35,074 --> 01:58:38,610
before a bad thing happens,
and... And we're gonna...

2297
01:58:38,644 --> 01:58:40,012
We'll be in trouble.

2298
01:58:40,046 --> 01:58:43,415
I remember when I first
landed at Keating.

2299
01:58:43,448 --> 01:58:45,885
Um, I got off the helicopter.

2300
01:58:45,918 --> 01:58:46,953
And when you got
off the helicopter,

2301
01:58:46,986 --> 01:58:48,487
you're supposed
to take a knee,

2302
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:50,957
'cause the propeller blades
create such a prop blast

2303
01:58:50,990 --> 01:58:53,291
that it, like, pushes you over.

2304
01:58:53,325 --> 01:58:56,361
But I was just, like, staring with
my mouth open, looking at the...

2305
01:58:56,394 --> 01:58:58,931
At all... Like, the mountains,
and just being in the valley,

2306
01:58:58,965 --> 01:58:59,899
and it was so strange.

2307
01:58:59,932 --> 01:59:02,635
I remember being down
in the middle of it,

2308
01:59:02,668 --> 01:59:04,971
and just looking
up, and up, and up.

2309
01:59:05,004 --> 01:59:09,407
And finally, I could see, like,
the top of... Of the...

2310
01:59:10,042 --> 01:59:12,011
The switchbacks.

2311
01:59:12,044 --> 01:59:14,546
And it was just like
that all the way around.

2312
01:59:14,579 --> 01:59:16,515
Being able to play myself is...

2313
01:59:16,548 --> 01:59:18,084
Is unique.
You know, it's a very...

2314
01:59:18,117 --> 01:59:21,654
I don't know if that happens
very often in this industry.

2315
01:59:21,687 --> 01:59:24,757
But as we were saying,
just the realness of here,

2316
01:59:24,791 --> 01:59:26,525
it's put me back
into that mindset,

2317
01:59:26,558 --> 01:59:29,762
and I've tried to embrace that,
you know, with the uniform

2318
01:59:29,796 --> 01:59:33,065
and, you know, the names of all
those soldiers that were lost,

2319
01:59:33,099 --> 01:59:34,767
that are still
walking around here,

2320
01:59:34,801 --> 01:59:36,535
you know, doing their role.

2321
01:59:36,568 --> 01:59:38,336
Um, I think it's special,
you know.

2322
01:59:38,370 --> 01:59:39,772
And to be able
to play myself,

2323
01:59:39,806 --> 01:59:42,041
I'm very grateful
that I'm still alive.

2324
01:59:42,074 --> 01:59:45,477
And it's almost
an obligation, I feel,

2325
01:59:45,510 --> 01:59:48,014
to bring authenticity
to this film.

2326
01:59:48,047 --> 01:59:53,485
At... At LRAS 2, five men
gave their lives to save mine.

2327
01:59:53,518 --> 01:59:56,454
They were either directly at
that position or supporting it.

2328
01:59:56,488 --> 01:59:58,724
And so when I wear the medal,
I think about them.

2329
01:59:58,758 --> 02:00:01,526
I also wear
the memorial bracelet,

2330
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:02,995
and in fact,

2331
02:00:03,029 --> 02:00:05,530
most people think
of Memorial Day

2332
02:00:05,564 --> 02:00:08,600
as a time to celebrate or...

2333
02:00:08,634 --> 02:00:11,704
Or have hot dogs,
but it's actually a very somber time,

2334
02:00:11,737 --> 02:00:16,976
to where we recognize what a lot
of men and women have died for.

2335
02:00:17,009 --> 02:00:19,979
When I came in with the QRF
down the switchbacks,

2336
02:00:20,012 --> 02:00:23,615
it was nighttime,
and you could see the flames

2337
02:00:23,649 --> 02:00:26,384
against the canyon walls.

2338
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:31,824
Um, and in the flicker
of the flames

2339
02:00:31,858 --> 02:00:34,727
kind of dancing
on the canyon walls behind it,

2340
02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:37,964
and in the buildings
over the course of that night,

2341
02:00:37,997 --> 02:00:41,067
started... They were razed. I mean,
they started falling to the ground.

2342
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:42,101
Yeah.

2343
02:00:43,102 --> 02:00:47,405
And I remember as I...
As I walked the outpost

2344
02:00:48,473 --> 02:00:50,009
when the battle was over,

2345
02:00:50,542 --> 02:00:51,978
and the buildings were

2346
02:00:52,011 --> 02:00:55,447
literally falling to the ground,
I would see,

2347
02:00:55,480 --> 02:01:00,920
um, black spots on the ground
that were dark as motor oil.

2348
02:01:00,953 --> 02:01:04,489
And then the flame,
the light of the flames

2349
02:01:04,522 --> 02:01:06,692
from the buildings
would kind of illuminate it,

2350
02:01:06,726 --> 02:01:10,663
just enough for me to see
that it was a very deep color

2351
02:01:10,696 --> 02:01:12,031
of red, and that's
when I realized,

2352
02:01:12,064 --> 02:01:16,168
"Oh, this is where...
This is where one of our soldiers died."

2353
02:01:16,202 --> 02:01:22,842
It's a very hard terrain
out in Nuristan.

2354
02:01:22,875 --> 02:01:25,878
It's incredibly difficult to...

2355
02:01:25,912 --> 02:01:28,915
To win a battle when you're
in the low ground like that.

2356
02:01:28,948 --> 02:01:30,515
It's... It's near impossible.

2357
02:01:30,548 --> 02:01:32,584
I mean, the only reason
it was possible for these guys

2358
02:01:32,617 --> 02:01:35,221
was because of some
very strong leadership,

2359
02:01:35,254 --> 02:01:37,757
uh, at the camp itself,

2360
02:01:37,790 --> 02:01:41,127
and because they had an
immense amount of air support,

2361
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:44,063
um, once it finally came in.

2362
02:01:44,096 --> 02:01:47,532
I want people to know
about Stephan Mace.

2363
02:01:47,565 --> 02:01:50,636
I want, you know, more people
to know about Justin Gallegos

2364
02:01:50,670 --> 02:01:52,905
and the six others
who died that day.

2365
02:01:52,939 --> 02:01:55,540
Vernon Martin,
I knew him for...

2366
02:01:55,573 --> 02:01:57,575
For about three or four years.

2367
02:01:57,609 --> 02:01:59,178
Scusa, I knew him
for about three or four years

2368
02:01:59,211 --> 02:02:00,279
from our deployment
to Iraq together.

2369
02:02:00,313 --> 02:02:03,149
And so, I mean, these...
They were incredible people,

2370
02:02:03,182 --> 02:02:04,684
incredible humans.

2371
02:02:04,717 --> 02:02:09,487
Uh, that... I think
it's important

2372
02:02:09,521 --> 02:02:13,525
for more people to know
about these eight

2373
02:02:13,558 --> 02:02:14,894
that sacrificed themselves

2374
02:02:14,927 --> 02:02:16,762
and hopefully spark an interest
in learning more about

2375
02:02:16,796 --> 02:02:19,665
others that have
sacrificed themselves

2376
02:02:19,699 --> 02:02:22,702
for the greater good
of the United States' security.

2377
02:02:22,735 --> 02:02:24,536
In my own words,
I would describe

2378
02:02:24,569 --> 02:02:26,839
Combat Outpost Keating
as a...

2379
02:02:27,873 --> 02:02:28,941
I don't know.

2380
02:02:28,975 --> 02:02:32,645
I read somewhere in the Bible,
the gates of heaven

2381
02:02:32,678 --> 02:02:35,281
and the gates of hell
are in the same spot.

2382
02:02:35,314 --> 02:02:39,551
So at the time of the firefight,
this was the...

2383
02:02:39,584 --> 02:02:40,618
The gates of hell.

2384
02:02:40,653 --> 02:02:44,790
But watching men, you know,
sacrifice themselves

2385
02:02:44,824 --> 02:02:47,226
to protect each other,
you can see the true form

2386
02:02:47,259 --> 02:02:49,628
of what, uh,
brotherhood and love is.

2387
02:02:49,662 --> 02:02:51,831
And so therefore, it would be
the gates of heaven as well.

2388
02:02:53,032 --> 02:02:54,633
That's the best way
I can describe it.

{1600}{1700}I couldn't remember Germany.
{1701}{1801}I only knew there's snow and 4 seasons.
{1802}{1904}And that our family was there.|Everyone, not just mum and dad. Everyone.
{1905}{1992}And that I liked that.
{2031}{2131}But I know as well that I was|always afraid of something.
{2132}{2290}Of the other children, of the people on|the streets. I was even afraid of dogs.
{2402}{2458}Oh come on, I'll help you.
{2786}{2911}Germany is a dark place for me.|Not so light and hot as Kenia.
{2912}{3011}A place with big buildings|and gloomy rooms.
{3012}{3137}Dad says that Germany is our home.|I guess he misses his own father.
{3138}{3262}My grandfather. He's allergic to nuts|And was not allowed to eat nut cookies.
{3263}{3409}He liked Heinrich Heines poems.|Especially those about Germany.
{3473}{3556}I had two aunts there too,|I really like them
{3557}{3657}Aunt Kהthe was my mother’s sister.|Dad’s sister was called Liesel.
{3658}{3757}Sometimes they helped out in grandfather’s|hotel Eagle..
{3758}{3831}But that was before the Nazis came.
{4038}{4113}May I help you?
{4114}{4189}No, thank you!
{4496}{4571}We have to leave now.
{4640}{4740}The Nazis didn’t allow my father|to work as lawyer.
{4741}{4854}And they took grandfather’s hotel.|So the whole family had no job.
{4855}{4981}I always got the same answer|If I asked my mother why:
{4982}{5058}Because we are Jews, Regina.|That’s the only reason.
{6256}{6331}Bwana! Bwana! Bwana!
{6359}{6434}Bwana! Bwana! Bwana!
{6487}{6587}- What’s up?|- An urgent message.
{7221}{7271}Walter.
{7277}{7367}Walter! Wake up!|This is Chinin! It's good.
{7481}{7533}Bring me the coffee.
{7559}{7608}Hurry!
{7705}{7798}God damn it, Walter, wake up!
{8137}{8214}Walter, open your mouth!
{8364}{8474}Excuse me, I have to open|the door. Hold on!
{8475}{8604}Aunt Jettel, is there still some apple|juice left?
{8635}{8758}Anna! I’m glad that you came.|Rudolf come in.
{8759}{8860}Good evening, Miss Redlich.|You shouldn’t talk to them!
{8920}{9080}Anna, hello.|Hi, Ina.
{9110}{9218}Hubert, Jrgen! Stop playing with fire!|You will light up the whole building.
{9219}{9294}Sure, Klara.
{9355}{9457}Here. Bite this|You will have to get used to this
{9458}{9579}The negros eat everything burned.|Or raw and bloody!
{9580}{9680}But they eat dogs!|I know that from my geography book.
{9681}{9796}They eat grasshoppers too. Hold him!|What do you want in Africa?
{9797}{9933}You don’t even dare to touch|a dog.
{9934}{9983}Does this food contain nuts?
{9984}{10034}This was the only thing I|could get, Mister Redlich!
{10035}{10134}But, Klara.|There are not that many nuts in it!
{10135}{10234}Because you have to sneeze, right?
{10235}{10310}Every god damn time.
{10352}{10462}I loved the green. Walter bought|it on New Year’s Eve.
{10463}{10565}But actually it doesn’t suit me anymore.
{10566}{10641}Then take it.
{10679}{10754}You’re an angel, Jettel. Thank you.
{10767}{10879}Kהthchen. No tears, ok?
{10880}{10982}Stay to your ass, Liesel.|That’s how men like it.
{10983}{11082}- A letter for you.|- For me?
{11083}{11158}Some glitter is good for you.
{11159}{11245}Thank you very much!
{11264}{11339}It’s from Africa.
{11466}{11545}Rongai, Kenia, December 2nd 1937.
{11555}{11680}Dear Jettel. I can imagine how excited|you are because of this letter
{11681}{11781}but I beg you to be strong.|The Jewish community in Nairobi
{11782}{11906}will pay the fees for your immigration.|Time has come now
{11907}{12046}In 6 months I can afford|letting Regina and you Come here.
{12047}{12150}Don’t hesitate any longer!|Go to Karl Silbermann immediately.
{12151}{12275}He can I help you with the schedule.|Tell him which ferry to take
{12276}{12338}It doesn’t matter how|long he will be traveling
{12339}{12401}It’s most important that you both go.
{12402}{12527}We definitely need a fridge.|If it doesn’t fit in our boxes,
{12528}{12629}get rid of the Rosenthal-dishes.|That doesn’t count there.
{12630}{12722}And please get some gas lamps,|mosquito nets and sturdy shoes!
{12723}{12832}for you and Regina. Don’t try to take|cash or jewels!
{12833}{12943}You know the Nazis. Talk as little|as possible about your plans.
{12944}{13044}You can’t trust anybody,|even those people,
{13045}{13170}who were our best friends.|I’ve heart-rending feelings when I think
{13171}{13296}you both being in my arms.
{13297}{13387}It’s hard to imagine how painful|this letter will be to you mother.
{13440}{13520}Walter? Listen to me! You have malaria.
{13530}{13640}You have to take this!|You understand? That’s very important!
{13641}{13714}I have to go back to the ranch.|Owuor will take care of you.
{13741}{13795}He needs Chinin 3 times a day,
{13813}{13856}Three times 40 drips.
{13990}{14032}Understood?
{14033}{14073}Understood
{14433}{14539}Max, what’s up? We have to go!
{14540}{14620}I don’t like railway stations
{14690}{14790}In one or two years this|will be over anyway.
{14992}{15077}You guys stay close eachother, ok?
{15115}{15209}Promise that you make it out together.
{15331}{15380}There’s always the one who|loves more than the other one.
{15381}{15429}That’s why it’s so difficult.
{15472}{15550}The one who loves more can be hurt easily.
{15725}{15804}My son loves you very much!
{15897}{15955}I’ll be missing you so much, Max.
{16137}{16187}Mum!
{16656}{16745}Say goodbye please!
{18064}{18095}Eat this.
{18103}{18170}This will get the bad|things out of your body.
{18219}{18265}Very good!
{18340}{18448}Do you know Schlesisches Himmelreich?|(Silesian Heaven)
{18465}{18583}Meat, potatos, bacon, dried fruits,|mixed up together. Mmmh!
{18598}{18661}I don't understand a single word!
{18742}{18842}You know? In my first life|I was a lawyer.
{18909}{19011}Kikombe.|Kikombe!
{19012}{19062}Kikombe.
{19065}{19164}Kiyo la dirisha.|Kiyo la dirisha.
{19165}{19240}Kiko la di...
{19260}{19335}Dirisha la Kiyo.
{19351}{19432}Dirisha la Kiyo.
{21150}{21210}Owuor? This is for you.
{21211}{21269}You give me your coat?
{21270}{21313}That's not a coat. It's a robe.
{21322}{21398}I was sick and you took care of me.
{21403}{21466}Thank you Owuor.
{21506}{21598}I used to wear this robe at home.
{21603}{21673}When I was not yet a Bwana but|used my brain
{21823}{21898}And you don't wear it here?
{21911}{21986}For that robe you have to be smart.
{21998}{22086}Here in Rongai you are smart. Not me.
{22168}{22205}"Robe" I'll need to say|those words very often
{22229}{22294}so that i can say them as well as you.
{22355}{22393}Thanks a lot.
{22525}{22639}6 weeks we spent together on this steamship|and circumnavigated Africa.
{22640}{22743}On April 201938, Hitler’s birthday|We arrived in Nairobi.
{22744}{22819}Regina, hold that for me please.
{22903}{22981}Mr. Morrison, the owner of the farm|where my father worked gave us a ride.
{23588}{23688}I had to think about chocolate|But mum explained me that|from this point on we were poor
{23689}{23795}And there’s no chocolate for|for poor kids.
{23796}{23882}I promised to be brave.
{24137}{24186}Hey, come here.
{24187}{24232}How did that cow die?
{24233}{24272}We don't have enough water.
{24280}{24332}Shit! Always the same!
{24363}{24401}You have to dig a well.
{24410}{24439}A well!
{24836}{24900}A car is coming!
{25141}{25184}Where?
{25202}{25244}Over there.
{26089}{26179}Now everything is fine.
{26413}{26457}Welcome.
{26458}{26489}Welcome, little Memsaab!
{26511}{26561}Come to me.
{26730}{26798}Welcome to Rongai!
{27119}{27229}Regina, my darling! Come here!
{27230}{27351}And we were in England and Marocco,|everywhere at the harbour. I saw dolphins!
{27352}{27452}Mum danced too the other night!
{28268}{28327}Bwana, he means water.
{28644}{28683}Explain him what he has to do.
{28684}{28751}Yes, Bwana.
{29692}{29792}There’s little water for the battle
{29898}{29960}The fee to leave the|country was expemsive.
{29961}{30023}We had luck. They just|opened 1 box at the border…
{30024}{30124}filled with clothes.|Max gave me this for you.
{30125}{30239}The books were in the other box.|Thanks God!
{30240}{30341}I know that this is not what you expected.
{30342}{30417}It’s beautiful.
{30446}{30524}But we can’t live here.
{30830}{30938}Everything except those over there.
{30939}{31005}We wont stay long here anyway.
{31366}{31449}Memsaab. Plate. One plate.
{31465}{31603}You have to learn German if you|want to talk to me. Plate!
{31736}{31832}Attention!
{31861}{31911}Plate!
{32650}{32725}Jettel? My name is Skind.
{32741}{32829}Walter as well.|Everybody calls me Skind.
{32833}{32897}Alright.
{32898}{33024}Walter shows Regina the farm.|They will be right back.
{33046}{33146}You want to have dinner with us?
{33147}{33297}I’ve had a 4 hours ride.|I can’t go back tonight.
{33358}{33489}I brought onions, sugar|and cigarettes.
{33536}{33666}Praising God...
{34721}{34820}Chinin every day makes you blind.
{34821}{34921}You can still fight against it|if you get it. Owuor!
{34963}{35086}Let’s drink on the arrival of Jettel|and Regina. On our second life.
{35087}{35152}Cheers.
{35245}{35345}How long have you been away|from home?
{35346}{35446}Sweetie was smart enough to|leave Germany in ‘33.
{35447}{35569}The departure was much easier. You could|take all you money with you right?
{35570}{35594}Especially your books.
{35595}{35655}And your wife? Weren't you married?
{35721}{35764}No I wasn’t.
{35765}{35807}And why not?
{35808}{35854}Jettel!
{35855}{36017}I never had luck because I always|fell in love with married women
{36077}{36202}My mother always says that the|Nazis wont survive long.
{36203}{36295}Germany is a nation of culture,|the country of Goethe and Schiller.
{36296}{36420}Dad! I think I heard lions!
{36421}{36504}Those were monkies
{36625}{36704}You start talking like a black!
{36830}{36913}The air is muggy and dusk is breaking,
{36914}{36989}Smooth is flowing the Rhein.
{36990}{37089}The summit of the mountain is|glimmering.
{37090}{37190}The most beautiful virgin is up there.
{37191}{37302}She’s combing her blond hair…
{37303}{37403}…and is singing a song
{37404}{37492}…with a beautiful melody
{37513}{37613}The sailor’s heart has been ached
{37614}{37737}He doesn’t look at the rocks,|He just looks into the sky.
{37738}{37846}I think the waves will eat|the sailor and his boat.
{37847}{37963}And all that time he’s singing...
{37964}{38039}Have a good night honey.
{38686}{38788}You didn’t bring the refrigerator right?
{38789}{38839}Jettel?
{38847}{38922}No I didn’t.
{38923}{39023}There was no space left in the boxes.|You know, we were allowed to have just 2...
{39024}{39121}But there was space left for this crap!
{39122}{39272}What did you do with all the money?
{39273}{39373}I just bought this.
{39374}{39464}It wasn’t expensive, just 4 Mark.
{39480}{39552}You bought a grown?
{39580}{39630}Yes I did.
{39985}{40125}(Goebbels)... in his name.|And the stamp of his peronality
{40127}{40202}[going on and on... ]
{40205}{40308}Damn, I never thought I would|enjoy his voice
{40309}{40434}I’ll leave the radio here.
{40435}{40589}We can’ take this gift.
{40590}{40728}But know I have a reason to come back
{40729}{40829}to recharge the batteries.
{41067}{41166}Do you have a rifle?
{41167}{41279}Since Jettel and Regina are here now...
{41280}{41382}Good luck with the well!
{41820}{41886}Come on little Memsaab!
{41906}{41936}Do you see the holy mouontain?
{41937}{41977}That's Mount Kenya.
{42002}{42051}It is holy.
{42077}{42132}Mount Kenya
{42170}{42221}Little Memsaab, let's go!
{42271}{42407}I can’t go any further.|Mum told me to stop here!
{43115}{43190}Could you help me out?
{43211}{43260}Help!
{43261}{43298}I am a cook
{43311}{43360}A cook doesn't dig holes.
{43430}{43473}The fields are thirsty
{43486}{43562}You need more water.
{43569}{43600}Come with me!
{43633}{43679}Water.
{44226}{44260}No men?
{44261}{44325}No, men don't carry water.
{44338}{44384}Women only.
{44773}{44847}Help me! It's so heavy.
{45253}{45303}please help me too!
{45316}{45373}The water is so heavy...
{45374}{45463}Help us too!
{45871}{45913}Please give me the shovel!
{46245}{46368}I lost my heart in Heidelberg...
{46378}{46425}Fire.
{46479}{46533}Yes. Fire.
{46605}{46648}There is no water, Bwana.
{46649}{46680}Didn't I tell you.
{46693}{46773}You were right, Chepoi
{46786}{46823}I'm sorry.
{46849}{46893}Go home!
{46905}{46938}Thank you. Thanks a lot!
{47275}{47334}6 months later
{47355}{47464}Why doesn’t Owour slaugter chicken?
{47465}{47563}That’s how it is arranged with Morrison.|Just the eggs.
{47565}{47665}I can’t stand this garbage.|From time to time I need meat!
{47666}{47741}Thanks, Owuor.
{47820}{47888}Fire.
{48023}{48086}You have to look at the fire,
{48100}{48136}if it has been quiet a while.
{48186}{48286}Don’t be afraid.|It’s just a normal bush fire.
{48287}{48374}It wont reach the house...
{48778}{48879}Where do you wanna go?|Come on, that’s stupid.
{48880}{48980}I can’t stand it anymore.|That’s what you always say.
{48981}{49081}But I want to live with people,|whose language I can understand!
{49082}{49182}You don’t earn a single cent here. Every day|we eat eggs and semi-solid food!
{49183}{49291}How could Regina go to school?
{49292}{49367}Yeah we are alive! And why?
{49380}{49492}All day long we’re hoping for rain so that|the battle doesn’t die
{49493}{49593}which don’t even belong to us?|I’m feeling pretty rotten!
{49594}{49694}And sometimes I wish I were.
{49695}{49798}We just could escape in time!
{49799}{49880}Yesterday the Nazis burned down|All the synagogues in Germany
{49881}{50003}and pillaged all the Jewish shops.|They smashed everything to pieces.
{50004}{50070}People, houses, shops, everything.
{50095}{50191}Who should have informed you about|this on this goddamn farm?
{50192}{50338}In the morning I could|receive the Swiss radio.
{50444}{50554}For the Nazis we’re no longer human|beings for Christ’s sake.
{50560}{50678}I saw it coming.|I always saw it coming!
{50690}{50848}Do you get it now? It doesn’t|matter if Regina doesn’t study?
{50875}{50954}And mum, Kהthe and your dad?
{50973}{51115}I dont‘ know! I always said they|should leave Germany.
{51513}{51588}November 10th 1938.
{51591}{51691}Dear dad, I’m very worried about the
{51692}{51796}news we hear from Germany.
{51797}{51872}What do you say?
{51880}{51992}I’d love to know that you guys|are alright! If I earned money we could
{51993}{52093}afford that you leave the country!|Isn’t there any way?
{52094}{52194}Do you really think it’s too late?
{52195}{52296}Oh dad I tell you that I’m looking
{52297}{52371}forward to see you.
{52455}{52567}Here in this foreign country I realize|how lucky we were back home
{52568}{52668}and how i appreciate everything|you did for me.
{52669}{52769}Don’t think that the money you|spent is lost.
{52770}{52870}I’m grateful that you let me|study so long.
{52871}{52996}One day I will be again the lawyer|you were so proud of.
{53393}{53473}Little Memsaab, come here!
{53773}{53823}It needs you
{53836}{53893}It's a kid (Toto) like you.
{54142}{54242}Hold it carefully.
{54447}{54497}Toto!
{54531}{54630}Eww that’s cold!
{54631}{54729}I don’t care.
{54730}{54855}There are a lot of other kids here.|But be careful! They all have malaria.
{54856}{54967}I don’t want you to be ill.
{54968}{55066}You can’t change it! A white kid|isn’t a black kid.
{55068}{55195}Never eat anything they give you!|Never enter their homes!
{55196}{55246}So.
{55264}{55317}Swallow this!
{55318}{55418}That tastes so nasty.|You get blind too!
{55419}{55496}Bullshit! Open your mouth!
{55555}{55659}Hey mum? Tonight they want to|celebrate for their ancestors.
{55660}{55768}They want to slaughter a lamb to|pray to God Hnai to ask for rain.
{55769}{55866}He lives on Mount Kenia.|And in the trees as well.
{55867}{55981}That’s going to be a huge party.
{55982}{56094}They pray for rain. That’s important.
{56095}{56195}The negros do it like this as well?
{56196}{56296}Says who?
{56297}{56377}What shall I do with you?
{56379}{56481}You know, grandma used to say?
{56486}{56612}Don’t worry about Regina.|She knows what she does!
{56642}{56691}Exactly.
{56692}{56790}She knows what she does..|That’s what grandma used to say.
{56792}{56892}So, don’t worry ma!
{56893}{57039}I’m so scared that something|happens to you.
{57040}{57102}Toto? Toto!
{59695}{59748}Memsaab, Bwana is on killing spree...
{59761}{59798}with the big gun!
{60381}{60456}Shoot it to death!
{60528}{60640}I can’t!|You see that I can’t!
{60677}{60803}I just wanted you to have meat.
{61019}{61078}You don't want anything of it?
{61090}{61121}No.
{61125}{61198}You say you are not hungry
{61515}{61621}Good night.|I don’t mind if you read.
{61622}{61722}I already read this book 3 times.|It doesn’t make any difference
{61723}{61814}if I read it the 4th time
{61815}{61915}I didn’t expect that you|can hunt, Walter.
{61916}{62016}I couldn’t do it.|You’ve never killed an animal.
{62017}{62117}I want be able to do it!
{62118}{62217}I didn’t ask you to hunt.
{62218}{62339}You treat me like I'm an asshole!
{62340}{62440}As lawyer I’m you favourite panty|remover! And now?
{62441}{62541}Sweat-stained and unshaved|I don’t exist for you!
{62542}{62655}How come princess! I’m your husband!|I can say what I think!
{62656}{62770}You don’t have the right for a privileged|life! Untill now we just had luck!
{62800}{62925}So stop playing the daughter of|a middle class famlily.
{62926}{63031}you need to understand what’s|going on here!
{63032}{63132}One last thing. The way you treat Owur
{63133}{63258}remembers me of some people|back home in Germany.
{63259}{63346}I guess you don’t want to be|compared to those people!
{64127}{64153}That's pretty warm.
{64154}{64199}Yes, warm.
{64401}{64491}Habari, little dog.|Where did you coming from?
{64572}{64620}Chepoi, whos dog is this?
{64621}{64668}This dog doesn't have a home.
{64671}{64708}It's a wild dog.
{64715}{64762}He is homeless.
{64763}{64882}Dad, this dog is homeless!|Could I keep him? Please!
{64883}{64982}But you are afraid of dogs!
{64983}{65064}But I like this one. We’ll keep him.
{65065}{65165}We call him Rummler!
{65166}{65268}Rummler is a nice name!
{66046}{66096}Toto!
{66109}{66159}Toto!
{66727}{66777}Owuor!
{66793}{66837}Owuor!
{66838}{66917}The trucks are going fast.
{67308}{67408}We will all be interned!
{67409}{67507}Nobody can stay on his farm!
{67545}{67645}Kids and women will come to Nairobi.
{67646}{67720}Everything is going to be alright!|I promise!
{67738}{67791}I won't go away!
{67839}{67889}Walter!
{67940}{67983}Owuor! Take care of them!
{67996}{68037}Yes, Bwana. I will.
{68048}{68098}Regina!
{68555}{68659}Can I take this too?
{68660}{68710}Asante.
{68880}{68980}Let me help you.|Don’t forget your ID!
{68982}{69114}Do you speak German?
{69176}{69225}No tears little Memsaab!
{69236}{69281}I'll find you everywhere,
{69288}{69333}and follow you soon.
{69343}{69372}You promise?
{69373}{69400}I promise
{69401}{69454}I'll follow you and get you a new Toto.
{69463}{69540}No. I don’t want a new Toto.
{69544}{69586}I didn't protect it good enough.
{69591}{69643}Its mother would have taken more care of it.
{69648}{69698}I am not a good mother...
{69703}{69748}...for an antelope.
{69753}{69830}You are smart little Memsaab.
{69879}{69925}Take care of our stuff!
{69931}{69963}Good bye, Owuor!
{69966}{70004}Good bye, Rummler!
{70715}{70815}Suddenly we were no longer|refugees but enemies
{70816}{70916}We didn’t even know why the|British were locking us up.
{70917}{71017}We were Germans and Germany|was in war with Great Britain.
{71018}{71144}But we were Jews as well and|obviously not on Hitler’s side
{72557}{72632}Get off miladies
{72675}{72752}That’s a nice prison!
{73483}{73579}Can you understand that?
{73584}{73684}Maybe they didn’t know|where to keep us
{73700}{73800}What’s that?
{73801}{73879}Don't know. Something British.
{73980}{74055}Excuse me. Still free?
{74417}{74538}This remembers me of better times.
{74539}{74639}The chef de la cuisine used to|cook on a luxury cruise.
{74640}{74704}I’m very hungry!|This is lobster.
{74705}{74790}Fish, nice fish!|No thanks.
{74791}{74890}Thank you.|What"s wrong with it, ladies?
{75048}{75123}I Breslau we were never alone.|There was always something to do.
{75182}{75257}What a life!
{75258}{75376}Oh yeah, before immigation!
{75440}{75515}Are you done? Thanks.
{75889}{75966}No message for your husband?
{76081}{76181}It’s the feeling of being alone.|The feeling that you have
{76182}{76296}anything to say.|That you own anything
{76297}{76397}Some children maybe.|Realizing this is very painful!
{76398}{76473}You know what I am talking about?
{76474}{76574}Loneliness is a thing I can talk about.
{76575}{76677}With a wife like Jettel?|Such a beautiful woman!
{76706}{76779}She’s happy and full of life.
{76783}{76879}Maybe you don’t give her|a real chance.
{76884}{77010}Back home everything was fine.|Everyone played his part...
{77011}{77074}Now you can see.
{77075}{77197}I don’t want to see reality.|But I want a grown up wife,
{77198}{77273}who I can talk to!
{77274}{77374}I have to put it past me. My dad, Liesel...
{77375}{77454}Shut the fuck up!
{77458}{77508}Oi!
{77758}{77854}Sometimes I think we are 2 parcels.
{77881}{77981}Wrapped up together in a train
{77982}{78107}with unknown destination.
{78108}{78208}Nobody knows what the other one contains.
{78209}{78345}You think too much.
{78622}{78655}Hey!
{78777}{78877}Soon we started to get used to the hotel.|Every day our mothers and us took
{78878}{78979}a walk in he shadow and thought|what we were going to get for lunch.
{78980}{79080}If we could just spend a couple|of hours outside.
{79081}{79181}Inside you get insane.
{79283}{79383}Mum, I’m hungry!|You are all Jews, aren’t you.
{79384}{79480}Why don’t you just write a letter|To your community in Nairobi!
{79486}{79611}They still have something to say|in this country.
{79666}{79791}Soon the government figured out that|not all the Germans are with Hitler.
{79792}{79917}2 weeks later we could visit the|husbands in the camp.
{79918}{80042}With the brown uniforms it was hard to see
{80043}{80119}who was British and who was German.
{80417}{80477}Dad, got a real friend!
{80478}{80539}She’s called Inge. She|already kows how to read!
{80540}{80643}And mum wrote a letter!
{80644}{80754}A real letter, so that we could visit you!
{81020}{81120}You wrote to the British?
{81121}{81221}Perhaps we can go to Rongai soon!
{81222}{81322}You were very unhappy in Rongai right?|You guys want to drink something?
{81323}{81422}We all want to get back to the farms!
{81614}{81688}We can’t go back to Rongai.
{81689}{81789}I was made redundant. Because of the war.|Morrison doesn’t want to hire Enemy Alien
{81891}{82009}So I have no work and we have no home.
{82149}{82249}No matter what we have to do to|get our stuff from the farm.
{82250}{82375}Maybe he is still waiting for us.|Because he thinks that we may come back.
{82376}{82476}Then grandpa will maybe meet Owuor.
{82477}{82552}Yeah of course!
{83512}{83604}May I help you?
{83605}{83717}I need a special permission.|I have to visit Mr. Edward Rubens,
{83718}{83827}the mayor of the Jewish community.|It’s very important that I talk to him.
{83985}{84079}Here we are.|Please help yourself, Mrs. Redlich.
{84085}{84205}My husband and I we have been at|the Olymmpics in Berlin!
{84206}{84306}My first time in Germany.|My God, we were naiv.
{84307}{84432}Until the end we thought our|civilized friends will help us
{84433}{84533}and stop Hitler.
{84635}{84735}Where are you now?|Where have you been in ‘38?
{84736}{84836}Hitler didn’t invent anti-Semitism!|I don’t think, Mrs Redlich came here
{84837}{84958}to discuss politics with you! Right?|How can we help you my dear?
{84959}{85059}Mr. Morrison, the owner of our farm|doesn’t want Enemmy Aliens anymore.
{85060}{85160}But without work Walter can’t leave the farm
{85161}{85268}and we don’t know how to find new work.|That’s why I beg you for help.
{85269}{85390}We’d do anything.
{85391}{85516}Do you think you are the only one|who suffers from war?
{85517}{85617}Or do you think we are responsible?
{85618}{85718}You are alive!|By God, make the best out of it!
{85719}{85855}Eddie! I’m sorry, I can’t help you!|Excuse me.
{85918}{85993}We have relatives in Poland.
{85994}{86093}For ages my husband hasn’t heard|anything from them.
{86094}{86145}Sorry about that.
{86146}{86264}Well, good luck, my dear. Please take|these Biscuits for your little girl.
{86265}{86351}Thanks. Bye.
{87385}{87523}What are you doing here?
{87675}{87750}Why, what do you mean?
{87811}{87915}You are looking for a job for your husband.|On a farm
{87925}{88027}I got a friend here at the army.
{88032}{88107}He needs somebody.
{88147}{88228}I could talk to him.
{88311}{88391}That would be great.
{88408}{88483}...6... 7... 8...
{88654}{88729}You’re very beautiful, Mrs. Redlich.
{89371}{89452}Where were you? You have mail.
{89469}{89548}Looks pretty important.
{89570}{89670}Yesterday... today... what|the fuck means morgen?
{89671}{89772}Tomorrow!|Maybe you can remember this finally!
{89773}{89879}Tomorrow, there will be rain in Kenia.
{89880}{89984}Pussycat, pussycat, where have you been?
{89985}{90126}Pussycat, pussycat, what did you there?
{90127}{90199}Oh God, Regina!
{90200}{90287}Walter!
{90288}{90449}What did I do?
{90761}{90818}Here we are, Owuor!
{91111}{91219}Dad! The holy mountain!|Looks like a Chinese hat
{91220}{91320}Hey! Come down here?|You’ll brake your neck!
{91321}{91395}That’s the most beautiful place on Earth!
{91518}{91568}Thanks.
{91629}{91706}I am scared.
{91707}{91757}This place is much further away|from your farm than Rongai.
{91758}{91893}We wont see you often.
{91894}{91944}You promise?
{91947}{92029}We will see each other|more often than you like!
{92372}{92471}The damn cattle is out again.
{92472}{92634}Very good.
{92656}{92755}I’m your Bwana and I...
{92756}{92852}want you to undress yourself!
{92853}{92941}You will get grilled chicken if you do.
{93093}{93205}And now on the way down there.|Like a African woman.
{93598}{93732}Did you miss me in your hotel?
{94453}{94491}Good morning.
{94608}{94651}My name is Walter.
{94867}{94903}You will need my help.
{94908}{94958}I live here for 40 years.
{94968}{95013}I appreciate your offer!
{95221}{95271}Did Bwana Gibson die?
{95273}{95306}No.
{95311}{95348}He doesn't have time to be here.
{95353}{95390}He is in the Royal Army
{95396}{95448}He wants me to take care of his farm.
{95453}{95496}You have to show me everything.
{95500}{95539}You are not a British Bwana right?
{95542}{95623}No. I didn't come to|become rich in this country.
{95625}{95723}I came because I was|driven out of my country.
{95728}{95758}Which is your country?
{95763}{95827}Germany - It's far away.
{95831}{95870}It is at war.
{95939}{95986}Somebody steals you an ox,
{95993}{96061}it will be killed, cooked and eaten.
{96068}{96140}You will forget that soon.
{96143}{96186}But if somebody steals your land,
{96193}{96238}then it's always there.
{96243}{96318}You can visit it. It will always be there.
{96323}{96413}You can't forget that.
{97274}{97331}Daji Jiwan is Indian. He's a good Fundi.
{97336}{97402}He can help you build the house.
{97435}{97498}As long as you work for|me you'll get your corn.
{97503}{97585}Firewood, 2 liters milk per|day and 12 Schillings per month.
{97590}{97632}12 Schillings is not much.
{97637}{97762}I don't make deals. If you don't want|to work for me someone else will do it.
{97861}{97928}These men can't build a house for you.
{97933}{97981}I'll teach them how to do it.
{98302}{98340}Bwana, Kania is my brother.
{98341}{98377}He can tidy up the rooms.
{98381}{98427}Can he cook as well?
{98436}{98480}We need a cook!
{98502}{98577}No, Kania isn't a cook,|he can tidy up the rooms.
{98627}{98677}Kamau can cook for the dog.
{98678}{98691}For whose dog?
{98692}{98746}We don't have a dog.
{98881}{98952}Yes or No?
{98953}{99009}It's very expensive.
{99051}{99120}I have to pick up the mail.
{99601}{99668}Letters with those|stamps always bring tears.
{99669}{99734}I'll be the one who|gives Bwana the letter.

2
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,380
Oh, it’s you?

3
00:03:17,218 --> 00:03:18,876
- Going that way?
- Over there!

4
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:20,586
- Too bad!
- That’s life!

5
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:32,250
Hello, Mme Vercel.

6
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:33,712
<i>Put Julien on!</i>

7
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:37,458
Your husband’s out hunting.
He’s not back yet.

8
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:38,671
<i>Then, you’ll do.</i>

9
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,420
<i>Go to my bank</i>
<i>and get me a checkbook.</i>

10
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:45,462
<i>Mail it to room 813,</i>
<i>Hotel Garibaldi, Nice.</i>

11
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:47,962
I can’t leave now.
I’m alone here.

12
00:03:48,175 --> 00:03:50,580
And I’d need your signature.

13
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,210
<i>Don’t quibble with me!</i>

14
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:56,041
Remember, last time
the manager turned me down!

15
00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:58,463
He told me to get lost.

16
00:03:58,676 --> 00:04:00,797
<i>What nerve!</i>
<i>I’ll tell my husband.</i>

17
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:03,628
Go ahead. He’s on his way in.

18
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:08,375
It’s Mme Vercel. Hurry.

19
00:04:09,843 --> 00:04:14,335
I hope you can hear her. Sounds
like trumpets in the background.

20
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:17,218
And your wife’s rather
overwrought.

21
00:04:17,718 --> 00:04:19,875
It <i>does</i> sound like trumpets.

22
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:21,753
Marie-Christine?

23
00:04:22,594 --> 00:04:25,924
Come on, don’t be so uptight.

24
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,588
You must stay in Nice?

25
00:04:28,593 --> 00:04:29,209
3 more days?

26
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:33,422
I’ll send it.
But don’t be so nasty

27
00:04:33,677 --> 00:04:35,502
to my secretary.

28
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:38,504
Stop saying "that girl".
Her name’s Barbara.

29
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:41,798
Lost?

30
00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:43,256
If she said that,

31
00:04:43,802 --> 00:04:45,296
you were right.

32
00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:49,416
Why did you insult my wife?

33
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:51,459
You told her to get lost.

34
00:04:51,676 --> 00:04:53,085
No, I didn’t!

35
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,331
She’s high-strung,
but she doesn’t lie.

36
00:04:56,551 --> 00:04:57,712
Yes, she did!

37
00:04:57,926 --> 00:05:00,593
She got along well
with my former secretary.

38
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,717
Listen, Mr. Vercel,

39
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,292
why not let your wife pick
your next secretary?

40
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:07,623
My next one

41
00:05:07,843 --> 00:05:09,632
will start in a month.

42
00:05:16,593 --> 00:05:17,506
"Le Provencal?"

43
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:20,042
The Want Ads section, please.

44
00:05:20,593 --> 00:05:23,876
I’m looking for
a skilled secretary.

45
00:05:24,552 --> 00:05:26,839
She has to be fluent in English.

46
00:05:27,136 --> 00:05:28,676
A month from now.

47
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:30,675
Yes, references required.

48
00:05:31,302 --> 00:05:33,293
Marital status? Irrelevant.

49
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,090
Get yourself an orphan.
They’re used to being abused!

50
00:05:47,552 --> 00:05:49,210
Mr. Vercel, please.

51
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:51,959
Inspector Santelli to see you.

52
00:06:00,634 --> 00:06:01,962
Detective Jambrau.

53
00:06:02,843 --> 00:06:04,466
How was the hunting today?

54
00:06:04,677 --> 00:06:06,502
I didn’t hit anything.

55
00:06:06,718 --> 00:06:09,965
I don’t know why I bother.
I’m fed up.

56
00:06:10,177 --> 00:06:11,835
Notice anything unusual?

57
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:12,881
No...

58
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:16,671
I heard two odd shots.

59
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:19,168
The second
5 seconds after the first...

60
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:23,457
as if to kill off a duck.
But there was no duck.

61
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:24,625
There was no duck

62
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:29,259
but there was a hunter
whose head was shattered to bits.

63
00:06:29,761 --> 00:06:30,377
Massoulier?

64
00:06:30,761 --> 00:06:32,965
- Is he dead?
- How did you know it was him?

65
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,336
I didn’t mention his name.

66
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:39,171
I recognized his car
as I was leaving. It’s odd...

67
00:06:39,386 --> 00:06:41,377
he was a crack shot.

68
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,668
Maybe a suicide.

69
00:06:42,887 --> 00:06:45,126
He wouldn’t commit suicide, chief.

70
00:06:45,386 --> 00:06:47,756
His brother’s a priest.

71
00:06:48,595 --> 00:06:50,004
It doesn’t mean anything.

72
00:06:53,677 --> 00:06:56,165
Do you mind
if I leave early tonight?

73
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,713
Even if you mind, I don’t care.

74
00:07:00,093 --> 00:07:02,297
According to union rules...

75
00:07:03,093 --> 00:07:07,088
I can take 2 hours off
to look for a new job.

76
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:44,666
Vercel real estate!

77
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:47,589
<i>You sound like an angel...</i>

78
00:07:47,804 --> 00:07:50,257
<i>but you killed Massoulier.</i>
<i>You’ll pay for it!</i>

79
00:08:29,553 --> 00:08:32,586
<i>It’s me again.</i>
<i>It’s very rude to hang up.</i>

80
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,676
<i>Hello. Don’t hang up again.</i>

81
00:08:34,887 --> 00:08:37,801
No, madame. Wait a minute...

82
00:08:38,012 --> 00:08:39,919
Just let me lower the TV.

83
00:08:44,345 --> 00:08:45,257
Ok, I’m listening.

84
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,710
<i>You’re a murderer.</i>
<i>You killed Massoulier</i>

85
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:49,256
<i>because you were jealous.</i>

86
00:08:49,471 --> 00:08:51,545
<i>He was your wife’s lover,</i>

87
00:08:51,762 --> 00:08:53,504
<i>one of many...</i>

88
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:55,960
Madame, I could sue you.

89
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:57,755
<i>It was jealousy.</i>

90
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,050
<i>I know all about jealousy.</i>
<i>It’s agony.</i>

91
00:09:01,303 --> 00:09:04,253
<i>She slept with anyone</i>
<i>and tutti quanti.</i>

92
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:10,131
<i>Ask her about the silver dining set</i>
<i>that you got as a wedding present.</i>

93
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:11,883
Who are you?

94
00:09:12,095 --> 00:09:14,251
<i>If I were you, I’d kill myself.</i>

95
00:09:23,886 --> 00:09:25,712
<i>If she’s so virtuous,</i>

96
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:29,874
<i>ask her what she did</i>
<i>with the silver dining set.</i>

97
00:09:30,095 --> 00:09:30,960
<i>Who are you?</i>

98
00:09:31,345 --> 00:09:34,177
<i>If I were you, I’d kill myself.</i>

99
00:09:39,137 --> 00:09:41,590
"Me hate him?

100
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:44,250
"Oh no! You’re all wrong.

101
00:09:44,554 --> 00:09:47,042
"I’ve admired him all along.

102
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,875
"He’s a head taller
than the others.

103
00:09:50,388 --> 00:09:54,168
"Brave, yet gentle.
Noble and proud. Berard!

104
00:09:54,388 --> 00:09:56,462
"He rides past,
his head unbowed."

105
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,876
"He is charming."

106
00:09:58,096 --> 00:09:59,375
"Such a man must be..."

107
00:09:59,596 --> 00:10:00,425
"Refined."

108
00:10:00,637 --> 00:10:03,303
"His eyes reflect his great heart.

109
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:04,257
"A great heart!"

110
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,464
"Tremendous!"

111
00:10:05,678 --> 00:10:07,467
- "Gallant!"
- "Brave!"

112
00:10:07,678 --> 00:10:09,218
"And yet, kind!"

113
00:10:09,428 --> 00:10:10,589
"Tender."

114
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:12,593
- "Generous!"
- "Wonderful!"

115
00:10:12,803 --> 00:10:13,916
"I like him!"

116
00:10:14,136 --> 00:10:16,009
"His height is extraordinary!"

117
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,791
"His brow! His eyes! His nose!"

118
00:10:19,095 --> 00:10:21,927
"If she keeps on praising me,
I’m ruined."

119
00:10:22,387 --> 00:10:25,468
Not bad.
But if the king isn’t funnier...

120
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:27,468
I’ll play the part myself.

121
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:32,007
Let’s go on to Blanche
and the jester, Triboulet.

122
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:33,927
- Where’s Triboulet?
- He’s not here.

123
00:10:34,137 --> 00:10:35,630
Bertrand’s always late.

124
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:37,801
- Where is he?
- I don’t know.

125
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,967
Well, he’s your ex-husband.

126
00:10:41,263 --> 00:10:42,755
Does he know we’re rehearsing?

127
00:10:42,971 --> 00:10:44,761
Cut it out!

128
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:48,965
We’ve been divorced for a year.
I’m not his custodian.

129
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:50,672
Why not call his paper?

130
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:54,005
We’re wasting time.
Let’s look at the wardrobe.

131
00:11:08,637 --> 00:11:10,177
Hello, Mme Vercel.

132
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:17,298
You’ll wake all the neighbors.

133
00:12:20,595 --> 00:12:23,001
Come on,
it’s none of our business.

134
00:12:24,846 --> 00:12:28,460
<i>I know all about jealousy.</i>
<i>It’s agony.</i>

135
00:12:29,096 --> 00:12:32,461
<i>She slept with anyone</i>
<i>and tutti quanti.</i>

136
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:34,882
I admit it.

137
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:37,797
I was Massoulier’s mistress...

138
00:12:39,346 --> 00:12:41,751
but it’s ancient history.

139
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,388
He’s dead and so what?
He was a bastard

140
00:12:46,596 --> 00:12:48,422
and a lousy lover.

141
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:53,051
Leave me alone!

142
00:12:54,263 --> 00:12:55,590
I’ve nothing to say to you.

143
00:13:00,222 --> 00:13:01,763
Open the door.

144
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:04,003
I’m scared of you.

145
00:13:04,222 --> 00:13:06,012
Don’t be ridiculous!

146
00:13:07,431 --> 00:13:08,758
You won’t hit me?

147
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:11,259
Have I ever hit you?

148
00:13:45,305 --> 00:13:47,628
There’s no need
for you to be afraid.

149
00:13:48,513 --> 00:13:50,753
You know I never get angry.

150
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,053
I don’t understand anger.

151
00:13:54,681 --> 00:13:56,339
I don’t understand arguments.

152
00:13:57,389 --> 00:13:58,633
If someone disappoints me,

153
00:13:58,847 --> 00:14:00,388
I lower the iron curtain.

154
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:24,344
You’re reading the paper?

155
00:14:25,513 --> 00:14:26,970
Is it interesting?

156
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:33,258
I’m speaking calmly...

157
00:14:34,347 --> 00:14:37,214
and regretfully, but I mean it!

158
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:41,001
We must get a divorce.

159
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:48,168
Nothing to say?

160
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,512
I don’t hear you.
I’m reading the paper.

161
00:14:56,681 --> 00:14:58,719
I’m reading it for you.

162
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:02,466
Don’t talk.

163
00:15:03,472 --> 00:15:04,752
Look at me.

164
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:06,919
Wait...

165
00:15:07,723 --> 00:15:09,002
Wait awhile.

166
00:15:11,307 --> 00:15:13,344
I’m waiting for you, Julien.

167
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:21,752
Don’t tell them I’m here.

168
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,092
Inspector Santelli
wants to see you.

169
00:15:45,472 --> 00:15:46,385
We met today.

170
00:15:46,598 --> 00:15:48,221
He wants to see you again.

171
00:15:48,556 --> 00:15:52,466
Did you know Massoulier
was going hunting today?

172
00:15:52,556 --> 00:15:53,800
Certainly not.

173
00:15:54,014 --> 00:15:56,052
But you recognized his car.

174
00:15:56,264 --> 00:15:58,967
I told you I saw it
only as I was leaving.

175
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:02,712
What shot pellets go in this gun?

176
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:04,045
I’d say three.

177
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:08,093
Nowadays no one uses six but me.

178
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:15,634
This is Massoulier’s gun!
3 shot pellets.

179
00:16:17,015 --> 00:16:20,511
But Massoulier was killed
by two number six shots.

180
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:22,922
Is that why I’m here?

181
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,840
No.

182
00:16:25,347 --> 00:16:26,804
It’s to show you this.

183
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,888
The 6 shot pellets I bought.
I told you myself I use 6.

184
00:16:32,097 --> 00:16:35,213
You also told me
you were the only one to use 6.

185
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,388
You must be kidding!

186
00:16:38,473 --> 00:16:39,716
Look here Vercel...

187
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:43,802
I may be younger than you,
but I’m not intimidated!

188
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,802
It’s going to be a long night.
Tomorrow too.

189
00:16:48,514 --> 00:16:50,173
Then, I’ll call my lawyer.

190
00:16:52,806 --> 00:16:56,254
I can detain you for 48 hours
without a lawyer.

191
00:16:57,181 --> 00:16:58,638
Who is your lawyer?

192
00:16:58,848 --> 00:17:00,127
Mr. Clement.

193
00:17:01,098 --> 00:17:02,260
Go ahead, then.

194
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,553
I won’t answer any question
till he gets here.

195
00:17:09,473 --> 00:17:11,878
You won’t get a peep out of me...

196
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,172
not even the right time!

197
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:22,014
Good evening, Mr. Clement.

198
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:26,510
Bring in two chairs
and some sandwiches.

199
00:17:26,932 --> 00:17:28,968
Massoulier’s been killed.

200
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:29,880
I know.

201
00:17:30,098 --> 00:17:33,794
These idiots suspect me.
They want to detain me.

202
00:17:34,014 --> 00:17:35,044
It’s their right, but...

203
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:37,752
I think I was denounced.

204
00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:43,048
Not exactly, but accused
by a loony anonymous phone caller.

205
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:45,054
- Did you tell them?
- Not yet.

206
00:17:48,723 --> 00:17:50,381
What do you want here?

207
00:17:51,223 --> 00:17:53,510
One day,
I’ll find you in my bedroom.

208
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:55,631
We’ll see this with Mme Santelli.

209
00:17:59,932 --> 00:18:01,045
Listen to me...

210
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:03,760
You two, come here.

211
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:05,962
No conspiracies.

212
00:18:06,182 --> 00:18:07,344
Sit down.

213
00:18:07,557 --> 00:18:10,224
- Commissaire Santelli?
- What is it now?

214
00:18:10,432 --> 00:18:13,300
He’s an Albanian.
She’s his interpreter.

215
00:18:13,515 --> 00:18:15,921
They insisted on seeing you.

216
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:21,090
I want to live here,
in this country.

217
00:18:22,683 --> 00:18:24,887
I don’t want to be sent back.

218
00:18:26,724 --> 00:18:31,676
He wants political asylum here,
Inspector.

219
00:18:32,223 --> 00:18:34,344
Political asylum at 11 p.m.!

220
00:18:34,556 --> 00:18:37,305
I’ll see what I can do.

221
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:44,716
You kept us waiting!

222
00:18:44,932 --> 00:18:49,091
I know, I’m sorry. Killings
don’t happen everyday in this town.

223
00:18:50,515 --> 00:18:52,138
Massoulier died this morning.

224
00:18:52,682 --> 00:18:54,672
Neither a suicide nor an accident.

225
00:18:55,306 --> 00:18:57,713
He was hot pointblank
in the head.

226
00:18:58,307 --> 00:19:00,594
They’ve got a prime suspect.

227
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:02,804
When they went to get him...

228
00:19:03,182 --> 00:19:04,972
Vercel was about to flee.

229
00:19:05,182 --> 00:19:05,963
Julien Vercel.

230
00:19:06,182 --> 00:19:08,386
- Is he arrested?
- No, detained!

231
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:11,807
Do you feel better?

232
00:19:12,349 --> 00:19:13,925
Yes, thanks to you.

233
00:19:14,516 --> 00:19:16,057
But why does that cop

234
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:19,098
go on and on
about being younger than I am?

235
00:19:20,141 --> 00:19:23,056
That’s to overcome his timidity.
But he’s no fool.

236
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,925
I doubt the killer
is a local resident.

237
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,389
What about those phone calls?

238
00:19:32,391 --> 00:19:33,801
Just another maniac.

239
00:19:34,016 --> 00:19:35,129
Listen Clement,

240
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,545
I’m sure my wife
was Massoulier’s mistress.

241
00:19:39,682 --> 00:19:41,553
You’ve got no proof.

242
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,594
I can’t believe it.

243
00:19:44,931 --> 00:19:48,132
It’s true.
I’m considering a divorce.

244
00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:49,889
No, not now!

245
00:19:50,224 --> 00:19:51,882
It would look bad.

246
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,262
Have you told your wife?

247
00:19:55,515 --> 00:19:59,260
No, she’s in Nice.
She’s coming back tomorrow.

248
00:19:59,474 --> 00:20:00,422
Then wait.

249
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:02,590
You may work things out.

250
00:20:03,433 --> 00:20:05,553
The word "divorce" is ugly.

251
00:20:05,974 --> 00:20:07,384
Both the word and the act!

252
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:11,095
If things reach that stage...

253
00:20:11,766 --> 00:20:15,097
I’d feel wretched...
really wretched.

254
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,594
Here we are.

255
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,265
Thank you for everything.

256
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,675
Come in for a drink.

257
00:20:29,017 --> 00:20:30,047
No, thanks.

258
00:20:30,517 --> 00:20:33,468
My daughter’s feverish.
I want to make sure she’s okay.

259
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:35,682
Don’t worry.

260
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:38,461
Calm down and get some sleep.

261
00:20:47,557 --> 00:20:49,429
"You’re so kind, father."

262
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:53,463
"Are you not my own flesh
and blood?"

263
00:20:53,683 --> 00:20:57,013
I’m fed up!
Bertrand keeps on pawing me!

264
00:20:57,349 --> 00:20:59,589
Old Hugo didn’t mind
a little incest.

265
00:21:00,224 --> 00:21:04,799
"How can we stage out play...
If she won’t meet me half way?"

266
00:21:05,016 --> 00:21:06,723
Your attitude isn’t professional.

267
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:10,425
We’re not professionals.
We’re amateurs!

268
00:21:10,641 --> 00:21:12,466
We play for fun and charity.

269
00:21:12,683 --> 00:21:15,218
Who decided Bertrand
would play Triboulet?

270
00:21:16,017 --> 00:21:19,015
We’re wasting time.
Let’s start all over.

271
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:25,796
You come in when you hear!
"Here she comes".

272
00:21:26,017 --> 00:21:27,842
Help me move the door.

273
00:21:52,141 --> 00:21:56,265
I’ve got to leave town.
Can you manage the agency?

274
00:21:56,475 --> 00:21:59,805
Make up your mind!
You fire me and now I’m promoted.

275
00:22:00,016 --> 00:22:02,220
I’m in trouble.

276
00:22:02,474 --> 00:22:04,216
I can’t force you to help me.

277
00:22:04,433 --> 00:22:06,638
What do you want me to do?

278
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,301
I’ll explain.

279
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:11,965
"Heavens,
I’m terribly impatient.

280
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:15,136
"But I hear her footsteps.
Here she comes."

281
00:22:18,016 --> 00:22:19,558
"Two bells chime."

282
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:23,301
"Heavens,
I’m terribly impatient.

283
00:22:23,517 --> 00:22:26,266
"But I hear her footsteps.
Here she comes."

284
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:53,967
Put the lights out.

285
00:22:54,183 --> 00:22:56,967
What’s wrong?
The police let you go.

286
00:22:57,224 --> 00:22:59,050
Only because they had to.

287
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,759
I must go to Nice...

288
00:23:01,225 --> 00:23:03,678
to find out what
my wife was doing there.

289
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:05,676
To find out...

290
00:23:06,933 --> 00:23:09,682
whom she was meeting,
everything.

291
00:23:10,351 --> 00:23:13,882
If there was someone
besides Massoulier.

292
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,259
I must tell you something!

293
00:23:17,725 --> 00:23:20,012
Massoulier was my wife’s lover!

294
00:23:20,225 --> 00:23:21,552
I know it,

295
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,923
but it’s none of my business.

296
00:23:25,976 --> 00:23:27,350
Where’s the gun that was here?

297
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:28,721
In my pocket.

298
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:29,763
Oh, no!

299
00:23:31,184 --> 00:23:32,890
It’s crazy for you to run away,

300
00:23:33,517 --> 00:23:36,600
but if it’s to kill your wife,
I won’t let you.

301
00:23:36,852 --> 00:23:40,134
I’m not going to kill her...
she’s already dead!

302
00:23:40,351 --> 00:23:41,133
What?

303
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,215
She was killed
in our house this evening...

304
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,636
but I didn’t do it.

305
00:23:48,102 --> 00:23:49,130
Do you believe me?

306
00:23:50,975 --> 00:23:52,384
It’s hard to believe...

307
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:54,508
She came home at 7 p.m.

308
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,133
We had a big fight.
Then, this fool,

309
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:02,012
Santelli’s assistant,
took me back to the police station.

310
00:24:02,517 --> 00:24:03,974
I was very upset

311
00:24:04,184 --> 00:24:06,139
but they allowed my lawyer
to come over.

312
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,673
He drove me home.

313
00:24:08,892 --> 00:24:12,471
When he asked when my wife
was coming back, I lied...

314
00:24:12,683 --> 00:24:14,675
and said she’d be back in 2 days.

315
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:19,590
Because of that stupid lie,
I couldn’t ask him to help me.

316
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:26,058
My daughter’s feverish.
I want to make sure she’s okay.

317
00:24:26,477 --> 00:24:28,882
Don’t worry.

318
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:31,389
Calm down and get some sleep.

319
00:25:24,726 --> 00:25:26,219
Do you believe me now?

320
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:30,095
- Would the cops believe me?
- No.

321
00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:32,799
I have no choice.

322
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:35,767
I must dig
into Marie-Christine’s past.

323
00:25:36,018 --> 00:25:39,798
I must investigate in Nice
where she ran a beauty salon.

324
00:25:40,018 --> 00:25:41,475
I’ve got to run.

325
00:25:41,685 --> 00:25:44,388
No, you can’t drive
in your condition.

326
00:25:44,602 --> 00:25:47,553
I’ll make you some coffee
or you’ll fall asleep.

327
00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:51,217
I’m much too keyed up
to fall asleep at the wheel.

328
00:25:55,061 --> 00:25:57,180
Let me give you my opinion.

329
00:25:57,393 --> 00:26:01,552
I think you should turn yourself in
as a temporary prisoner.

330
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:04,639
"A temporary prisoner!"

331
00:26:06,101 --> 00:26:07,344
And I’ll go to Nice

332
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,473
to investigate for you.

333
00:26:10,476 --> 00:26:12,301
I know Nice very well.

334
00:26:13,518 --> 00:26:15,639
I went to business school there.

335
00:26:16,226 --> 00:26:18,133
It was the best school

336
00:26:18,393 --> 00:26:23,181
for the Prevost-Delaunay system.
It was on Plaza Albert Ist.

337
00:26:24,018 --> 00:26:26,720
I guess that’s not very exciting.

338
00:26:27,268 --> 00:26:28,595
Here’s the coffee.

339
00:27:19,602 --> 00:27:20,300
Damn it!

340
00:28:23,644 --> 00:28:24,591
POLICE STATION

341
00:29:05,312 --> 00:29:07,052
Is "rue des Entrepreneurs"
on the way?

342
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,977
To the Garibaldi? It’s not far.

343
00:29:10,227 --> 00:29:12,846
Then, let’s go!
57, rue des Entrepreneurs.

344
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:31,392
It’s a nightclub!

345
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,009
It wasn’t a beauty salon?

346
00:29:34,228 --> 00:29:35,970
It’s been
the "Red Angel" for years.

347
00:29:37,145 --> 00:29:40,391
If I were you,
I wouldn’t set foot in there.

348
00:29:40,894 --> 00:29:41,889
What do you mean?

349
00:29:42,103 --> 00:29:45,137
You may not believe me,
but if you come in,

350
00:29:45,354 --> 00:29:47,261
I won’t wait for you.
It’s Louison’s joint.

351
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,927
- Who is she?
- I don’t know...

352
00:29:50,478 --> 00:29:51,971
but I don’t want trouble.

353
00:29:52,603 --> 00:29:55,885
Make up your mind!
You stay

354
00:29:56,103 --> 00:29:57,645
or we go on but I’m leaving.

355
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:00,019
Okay, on to the Garibaldi.

356
00:30:09,603 --> 00:30:10,977
A room for the night.

357
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:12,726
Have you reserved?

358
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:18,431
Mme Vercel recommended
her room to me.

359
00:30:18,644 --> 00:30:19,592
Mme Vercel.

360
00:30:19,811 --> 00:30:23,640
She was in room 813,
but it isn’t ready.

361
00:30:23,978 --> 00:30:26,218
You can have room 811, next door.

362
00:30:26,436 --> 00:30:27,265
Fine.

363
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,012
Where’s your luggage?

364
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:30,768
It’ll be here tomorrow.

365
00:30:31,853 --> 00:30:34,389
But you wanted a room
for one night.

366
00:30:34,937 --> 00:30:38,717
Yes. My luggage will get here
in time for my departure.

367
00:30:40,895 --> 00:30:42,352
Just a minute, please.

368
00:30:59,145 --> 00:31:01,018
Shall I pay in advance?

369
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,806
No, it’s alright.

370
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:15,891
Germaine!

371
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:20,682
Come here!

372
00:32:21,103 --> 00:32:22,762
You must help me out.

373
00:32:22,978 --> 00:32:23,891
Right now?

374
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,726
It’s embarrassing.

375
00:32:27,395 --> 00:32:28,853
Don’t tell anybody!

376
00:32:29,229 --> 00:32:30,852
My trick can only make it...

377
00:32:31,312 --> 00:32:32,342
if I’m a maid.

378
00:32:32,562 --> 00:32:34,220
Is he the tax man?

379
00:32:44,146 --> 00:32:45,971
So you must lend me your apron.

380
00:32:46,313 --> 00:32:48,303
- What about me?
- I’ll give it back.

381
00:32:50,604 --> 00:32:53,271
Leave it on my shelf when you go.

382
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:55,810
May I help?

383
00:32:56,813 --> 00:32:58,887
I need a savonette.

384
00:32:59,355 --> 00:33:01,345
No problem. Just ask.

385
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:06,020
I’ve got a hunch
you know you way around. Right?

386
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,473
Tell me about her.

387
00:33:09,897 --> 00:33:12,136
I never saw this dame before.

388
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:19,178
The woman in the panther coat...
She was here this morning.

389
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:21,018
Was she alone?

390
00:33:21,229 --> 00:33:23,266
Yes, always by herself.

391
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:25,385
No visitors?

392
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:26,847
Never...

393
00:33:27,062 --> 00:33:28,436
I bet I know!

394
00:33:28,729 --> 00:33:32,011
The man with her
is your husband, right?

395
00:33:32,396 --> 00:33:33,889
No, he’s my brother.

396
00:33:45,813 --> 00:33:48,846
Since room 813 is ready,
can I stay here?

397
00:33:49,438 --> 00:33:51,096
It’s alright with me.

398
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,759
I’ll just tell the desk.

399
00:35:20,814 --> 00:35:21,844
What’s going on?

400
00:35:22,981 --> 00:35:23,561
It’s a mistake.

401
00:35:23,981 --> 00:35:25,604
I’m in the wrong room.

402
00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:33,600
I won’t let you leave!

403
00:35:33,854 --> 00:35:35,228
Don’t run away!

404
00:35:35,563 --> 00:35:37,388
- Who are you?
- Let me go!

405
00:35:38,104 --> 00:35:39,302
Who are you?

406
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,555
What did you do in my room?

407
00:36:00,355 --> 00:36:02,429
LABLACHE DETECTIVE AGENCY

408
00:36:53,272 --> 00:36:55,643
I was wrong to let Vercel go.

409
00:36:55,856 --> 00:36:58,012
I should have kept him here.

410
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:04,520
But you were with him.

411
00:37:04,981 --> 00:37:06,438
I left him at his house.

412
00:37:07,147 --> 00:37:08,522
He didn’t tell me

413
00:37:08,773 --> 00:37:09,970
his wife was back.

414
00:37:10,731 --> 00:37:13,267
I’m sure
he can explain everything.

415
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,271
Chief, a call from Nice.

416
00:37:21,232 --> 00:37:22,559
<i>Nice airport.</i>

417
00:37:23,024 --> 00:37:25,310
Nice airport.
Stop your search.

418
00:37:25,524 --> 00:37:27,680
We’ve located his car.

419
00:37:27,898 --> 00:37:29,225
He’s flown the coop!

420
00:37:41,772 --> 00:37:43,679
Good morning.
Mr. Lablache, please.

421
00:37:43,897 --> 00:37:46,682
He’s in conference.

422
00:37:49,523 --> 00:37:53,847
Remember, gentlemen!
Our job is 10 % inspiration

423
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:56,932
and 90 % transpiration.

424
00:38:02,356 --> 00:38:03,351
Mr. Lablache?

425
00:38:03,856 --> 00:38:05,432
Let me show you something.

426
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,975
It’s the woman I told you about.

427
00:38:09,481 --> 00:38:11,353
Leave us alone.

428
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,767
Put this on.

429
00:38:25,732 --> 00:38:27,273
They won’t recognize you.

430
00:38:28,482 --> 00:38:31,315
I’ll be frank with you,
I get the picture.

431
00:38:31,524 --> 00:38:35,932
I know about
the incident last night.

432
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,347
The man is a beginner here.

433
00:38:38,564 --> 00:38:41,811
He’s not good at shadowing jobs
so we gave him an investigation.

434
00:38:42,022 --> 00:38:43,136
End of story.

435
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:45,264
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

436
00:38:45,481 --> 00:38:49,177
We both know
that private detectives

437
00:38:49,397 --> 00:38:51,602
have no right to break and enter.

438
00:38:51,815 --> 00:38:55,346
If I report this to the police,
you’ll be in trouble.

439
00:38:56,481 --> 00:39:00,771
I have a hunch
you won’t go to the police.

440
00:39:01,189 --> 00:39:02,102
Don’t bet on it!

441
00:39:02,315 --> 00:39:04,471
Normally, 9 persons out of 10

442
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,894
would have complained
to the hotel management.

443
00:39:07,107 --> 00:39:10,105
But you came straight here.

444
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,679
What do you want?
My apologies?

445
00:39:12,898 --> 00:39:15,601
I apologize most sincerely.

446
00:39:16,274 --> 00:39:19,391
I direct the most
reputable agency in Nice.

447
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:22,688
A client requested
a report on a woman.

448
00:39:22,899 --> 00:39:26,727
Yesterday, she was
in room 813 at the Garibaldi.

449
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,892
We didn’t know
she’d checked out.

450
00:39:30,108 --> 00:39:32,015
I accept your apologies...

451
00:39:33,233 --> 00:39:36,728
but I want to know
the name of your client.

452
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,062
Even if I knew it. No way!

453
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:42,390
But in this case,
he didn’t give his name.

454
00:39:42,606 --> 00:39:44,810
He calls us when he wants news.

455
00:39:45,023 --> 00:39:47,855
Do you think it was one
of her lovers?

456
00:39:48,064 --> 00:39:51,892
In the past 25 years,
I’ve learned one thing!

457
00:39:52,106 --> 00:39:56,101
It’s never the lover who has
a woman shadowed, it’s her husband!

458
00:39:58,398 --> 00:40:00,803
In that case,
tell me her name...

459
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,690
the name of the woman
in room 813.

460
00:40:03,898 --> 00:40:06,518
I’m sorry, but I can’t tell you.

461
00:40:06,774 --> 00:40:10,021
It’s Marie-Christine Vercel.

462
00:40:10,607 --> 00:40:12,681
Now, you’ve got to help me.

463
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,100
The bus to Marseilles?

464
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:19,892
Across the way!

465
00:40:47,523 --> 00:40:50,557
<i>"Le Capitaine" is ahead,</i>

466
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:52,889
<i>"Mon amour" a length behind.</i>

467
00:40:54,606 --> 00:40:57,854
<i>"Mon Amour", moves up to</i>
<i>the finish line</i>

468
00:40:58,107 --> 00:41:00,145
<i>and wins by a nose.</i>

469
00:41:10,649 --> 00:41:12,190
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>"Le Capitaine"?</i>

470
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:14,473
Mme Vercel’s lover?
Her "Amour?"

471
00:41:14,858 --> 00:41:18,472
No, "Le Capitaine" isn’t a man,
he’s a horse...

472
00:41:18,774 --> 00:41:20,978
<i>Same thing for "Mon Amour."</i>

473
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,263
Horse racing!

474
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:26,648
That’s where all her money went.
Here’s my bus.

475
00:41:27,941 --> 00:41:31,307
Check into the racing circles!

476
00:42:01,899 --> 00:42:03,061
How dirty!

477
00:42:10,274 --> 00:42:11,304
Don’t you realize?

478
00:42:12,024 --> 00:42:13,897
I’m locked in here,

479
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,513
gagged out,

480
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,639
with the phone ringing all day...

481
00:42:18,858 --> 00:42:20,895
and wild rumors spreading
in town.

482
00:42:21,775 --> 00:42:25,389
You meant well
and were trying to help

483
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:28,227
but it was up to me
to go to Nice.

484
00:42:28,442 --> 00:42:29,769
Helpful or not...

485
00:42:30,275 --> 00:42:32,598
I wouldn’t have lifted a finger

486
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,559
if I’d known you were a killer.

487
00:42:34,775 --> 00:42:36,149
What do you mean?

488
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:37,555
I know now!

489
00:42:38,484 --> 00:42:42,394
3 days ago, you asked a detective
in Nice to shadow your wife.

490
00:42:44,234 --> 00:42:45,608
I never left town.

491
00:42:45,817 --> 00:42:49,645
You did it by phone
and didn’t tell them your name.

492
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,187
You were suspicious of her.

493
00:42:52,441 --> 00:42:54,348
I might as well tell you!

494
00:42:54,691 --> 00:42:58,850
I always knew you were guilty,
but I went along with you

495
00:42:59,441 --> 00:43:03,649
because I thought it was
an unpremeditated crime of passion.

496
00:43:03,858 --> 00:43:06,809
In reality,
you planned the whole thing

497
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:09,270
and I find it revolting.

498
00:43:10,108 --> 00:43:11,684
No Barbara, you’re right.

499
00:43:12,024 --> 00:43:13,932
You’re entitled to the truth.

500
00:43:14,399 --> 00:43:15,513
I’m guilty.

501
00:43:15,983 --> 00:43:17,145
I’m guilty...

502
00:43:17,942 --> 00:43:19,351
just as you said.

503
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,650
But please try to understand me.

504
00:43:27,525 --> 00:43:29,647
You mustn’t think I’m a coward.

505
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:32,105
I’m ready to pay for what I did.

506
00:43:33,442 --> 00:43:36,855
Let’s go to the cops.
We’ll tell them everything.

507
00:43:38,942 --> 00:43:40,684
You’re right, Barbara,

508
00:43:40,942 --> 00:43:43,645
about the man
who wanted her watched.

509
00:43:43,943 --> 00:43:46,609
When we find him,
we’ll have the killer.

510
00:43:47,401 --> 00:43:48,313
What’s that?

511
00:43:48,984 --> 00:43:50,263
Be careful, Barbara.

512
00:43:53,817 --> 00:43:55,190
What do you want?

513
00:43:58,316 --> 00:43:59,513
I’m just doing my job.

514
00:43:59,733 --> 00:44:01,190
No stray dogs here!

515
00:44:02,649 --> 00:44:03,431
No dogs...

516
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:05,100
but lots of dead bodies.

517
00:44:06,274 --> 00:44:08,017
You’re not fussy, are you?

518
00:44:08,275 --> 00:44:09,981
Working for a killer.

519
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:11,933
I feel concerned.

520
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,892
I’m worried.

521
00:44:15,108 --> 00:44:17,099
Do you have a picture
of your boss?

522
00:44:17,816 --> 00:44:19,558
Is that all?
Draw it yourself!

523
00:44:21,234 --> 00:44:22,264
Go on, get lost!

524
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:24,895
Everybody knows
you sleep with him.

525
00:44:27,942 --> 00:44:29,103
You creep!

526
00:44:51,193 --> 00:44:52,650
The coffee’s warm.

527
00:45:08,275 --> 00:45:09,684
It’s hot, right?

528
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,441
Yes, very.

529
00:45:12,526 --> 00:45:13,805
Is it too hot?

530
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:17,483
No, it’s better when it’s hot.

531
00:45:22,108 --> 00:45:24,977
I’ll pick it up there.
You listen in.

532
00:45:25,443 --> 00:45:28,192
We’ll lift the receiver together.

533
00:45:29,609 --> 00:45:30,983
After the next ring.

534
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:38,308
Vercel Agency.

535
00:45:38,526 --> 00:45:41,643
<i>So it’s true?</i>
<i>I can hardly believe it.</i>

536
00:45:41,943 --> 00:45:43,057
Who is this?

537
00:45:43,276 --> 00:45:44,306
<i>You tramp...</i>

538
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:47,149
<i>working for a killer.</i>

539
00:45:47,401 --> 00:45:49,476
I didn’t know
he’d been indicted.

540
00:45:49,694 --> 00:45:51,352
<i>Don’t be a smart ass!</i>

541
00:45:51,777 --> 00:45:54,526
<i>I’m sure you know</i>
<i>where he’s hiding.</i>

542
00:45:54,735 --> 00:45:57,484
<i>Why don’t you join him, you slut?</i>

543
00:46:01,152 --> 00:46:02,892
You think it’s the same woman?

544
00:46:03,567 --> 00:46:05,309
I think I know her. Don’t you?

545
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:07,309
I’ve no idea.

546
00:46:08,984 --> 00:46:10,097
Watch out!

547
00:46:16,776 --> 00:46:18,399
I’d like to see Mr. Vercel.

548
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,932
He’s not here. Can I help you?

549
00:46:22,526 --> 00:46:26,222
I wanted to talk
to him about a château.

550
00:46:28,151 --> 00:46:28,850
A château...

551
00:46:29,401 --> 00:46:31,060
for a summer camp.

552
00:46:31,318 --> 00:46:34,435
Do you want to rent it, or buy it?

553
00:46:34,943 --> 00:46:37,431
Perhaps an annuity purchase.

554
00:46:37,651 --> 00:46:38,646
It’s risky...

555
00:46:38,859 --> 00:46:41,527
You must wait
till the owners are deceased.

556
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:45,728
But our camp’s only open
3 months a year.

557
00:46:45,985 --> 00:46:47,940
Even so,
you can’t evict the owners.

558
00:46:48,193 --> 00:46:49,769
They’re generally elderly.

559
00:46:50,068 --> 00:46:53,351
My vacation camp
is for adolescents.

560
00:46:53,569 --> 00:46:55,192
It’s rarely for senior citizens!

561
00:46:55,819 --> 00:46:57,525
Think it over.

562
00:46:58,111 --> 00:46:59,272
I’d like to get going

563
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:02,649
by next year.
Kids need a bracing climate,

564
00:47:02,902 --> 00:47:04,276
something high up.

565
00:47:04,485 --> 00:47:09,390
We have some nice properties,
between 900 and 1800 feet up.

566
00:47:09,651 --> 00:47:11,641
The ads say
"a step from the ocean."

567
00:47:11,901 --> 00:47:14,733
Do you want the mountains
or the beach?

568
00:47:14,942 --> 00:47:16,483
You seem a little confused.

569
00:47:17,484 --> 00:47:20,234
Isn’t this Mr. Vercel’s agency?

570
00:47:21,151 --> 00:47:22,727
Can’t I speak to him?

571
00:47:22,985 --> 00:47:26,148
He’s away at a convention...

572
00:47:26,693 --> 00:47:28,067
the real estate convention.

573
00:47:28,943 --> 00:47:30,815
You deal in real estate?

574
00:47:31,735 --> 00:47:33,726
Does this look like
a grocery store?

575
00:47:35,235 --> 00:47:37,060
I’ve got work to do.

576
00:47:37,443 --> 00:47:39,848
Why don’t you think things over.

577
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,935
Come back some other time.

578
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:44,811
Alright, I’ll be back.

579
00:47:45,902 --> 00:47:47,478
I’ll surely be back.

580
00:47:52,985 --> 00:47:56,269
If all our customers
were like that one...

581
00:47:56,486 --> 00:47:57,564
What a creep!

582
00:48:13,151 --> 00:48:14,146
A telex.

583
00:48:16,651 --> 00:48:19,566
"Report from Lablache to Vercel.

584
00:48:20,068 --> 00:48:22,936
"Marie-Christine Beauty Salon

"Signed! Lablache."

593
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:54,107
Take it to Clement,
but don’t tell him I’m here.

594
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,310
Why worry about him?

595
00:48:56,527 --> 00:48:58,648
After all, he’s your lawyer.

596
00:48:58,986 --> 00:49:01,273
Give me my raincoat.

597
00:49:01,737 --> 00:49:03,359
Just look!

598
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:05,193
Can I run around this way?

599
00:49:06,445 --> 00:49:09,015
Now, I’ll lock up and remember!

600
00:49:09,236 --> 00:49:10,978
Don’t answer the phone.

601
00:49:11,195 --> 00:49:12,521
Unless you call.

602
00:49:13,027 --> 00:49:14,436
How will you know?

603
00:49:15,027 --> 00:49:16,484
We’ll make up a code!

604
00:49:16,818 --> 00:49:18,892
Let it ring once and hang up.

605
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:21,563
When you ring again,
I’ll answer.

606
00:49:21,776 --> 00:49:23,186
Good idea. So long.

607
00:49:56,486 --> 00:49:58,062
Mr. Clement, please.

608
00:49:58,278 --> 00:50:00,399
He’s busy. Would you wait?

609
00:50:05,112 --> 00:50:06,688
There’s someone in.

610
00:50:07,195 --> 00:50:08,522
Have a seat.

611
00:50:10,695 --> 00:50:11,939
It won’t be long.

612
00:50:18,985 --> 00:50:20,644
If you won’t...

613
00:50:20,902 --> 00:50:22,478
I’ll go to the police!

614
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,483
It’s a scandal!

615
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,563
They were all jealous of him!

616
00:50:37,611 --> 00:50:39,317
My life is over now!

617
00:50:41,695 --> 00:50:43,520
It’s all over!

618
00:50:46,153 --> 00:50:49,483
I meant to call you. Come in.

619
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:57,729
My life is over!

620
00:51:02,987 --> 00:51:04,527
Take a deep breath.

621
00:51:07,904 --> 00:51:09,101
It’s awful!

622
00:51:09,529 --> 00:51:13,060
The more you love a person,

623
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,902
the less helpful you are.

624
00:51:15,112 --> 00:51:17,150
Wasn’t Mr. Vercel with you
that night?

625
00:51:17,362 --> 00:51:20,110
I drove him home
from the police station.

626
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:21,937
And you know,

627
00:51:22,403 --> 00:51:24,891
I wanted to ask him
to stay at my house...

628
00:51:25,111 --> 00:51:28,855
but I was embarrassed to.

629
00:51:29,069 --> 00:51:30,348
I didn’t.

630
00:51:30,569 --> 00:51:32,940
But Mme Vercel was already dead!

631
00:51:33,153 --> 00:51:34,350
Who knows?

632
00:51:34,903 --> 00:51:37,142
He told me she was still in Nice...

633
00:51:37,653 --> 00:51:41,693
and yet the police officer
saw her suitcase...

634
00:51:41,903 --> 00:51:43,526
one hour earlier in the salon.

635
00:51:43,903 --> 00:51:45,693
Why did Julien lie?

636
00:51:46,404 --> 00:51:49,899
You talk as if he was guilty.
Do you believe that?

637
00:51:50,112 --> 00:51:52,778
No, but to believe
or not to believe

638
00:51:53,195 --> 00:51:55,683
is not the question.
Life isn’t a novel.

639
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:59,226
In a novel,
our friend would be guilty.

640
00:51:59,946 --> 00:52:03,477
By running away, Vercel is acting
as if he were guilty.

641
00:52:03,779 --> 00:52:05,686
What would you do in his place?

642
00:52:05,987 --> 00:52:09,269
If he asked me,
I’d tell him what I’m telling you.

643
00:52:09,571 --> 00:52:11,230
No reason to worry.

644
00:52:11,696 --> 00:52:13,936
Thank God,
we’re in France where juries

645
00:52:14,654 --> 00:52:16,858
allow for crimes of passion.

646
00:52:20,696 --> 00:52:22,188
Meanwhile, tell me...

647
00:52:22,447 --> 00:52:24,234
what can I do for you?

648
00:52:24,736 --> 00:52:26,727
I want your advice.

649
00:52:28,403 --> 00:52:30,726
If you know where Vercel is,

650
00:52:30,944 --> 00:52:32,852
can you ask him...

651
00:52:33,069 --> 00:52:34,348
for instructions.

652
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:38,066
I’ve kept the agency open
but is that what he wants?

653
00:52:38,278 --> 00:52:39,191
Unfortunately...

654
00:52:39,445 --> 00:52:41,270
I don’t know where he is.

655
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:44,024
If I did,
I’d tell him to surrender.

656
00:52:44,237 --> 00:52:48,101
Only then can I really help him.

657
00:52:48,904 --> 00:52:51,227
If he contacts you, tell him that

658
00:52:51,446 --> 00:52:54,396
and ask him to call me at once.

659
00:53:03,321 --> 00:53:04,518
Come along, please.

660
00:53:04,738 --> 00:53:05,899
What for?

661
00:53:06,113 --> 00:53:07,984
The chief wants to see you.

662
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:19,028
What were you doing
in Nice last night?

663
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:20,861
None of your business!

664
00:53:21,071 --> 00:53:22,398
Is that so?

665
00:53:22,655 --> 00:53:25,487
I already know
that at the Garibaldi,

666
00:53:25,696 --> 00:53:28,184
you insisted on having room 813,

667
00:53:28,737 --> 00:53:31,225
the very one Mme Vercel
had just vacated.

668
00:53:32,153 --> 00:53:33,563
Mr. Vercel...

669
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:36,731
asked me for some information

670
00:53:36,945 --> 00:53:39,020
on his wife’s trip to Nice.

671
00:53:39,237 --> 00:53:41,642
But we both thought she was alive.

672
00:53:41,862 --> 00:53:45,192
At least, I thought so.
But never mind.

673
00:53:45,404 --> 00:53:48,188
I gather you also know
that 3 days ago,

674
00:53:48,404 --> 00:53:50,773
the Lablache agency
got instructions

675
00:53:50,987 --> 00:53:52,860
to check Mme Vercel’s past.

676
00:53:53,071 --> 00:53:56,519
When you’re about to kill someone,
you don’t consult a private eye.

677
00:53:57,113 --> 00:53:59,482
Why not try to find out

678
00:53:59,696 --> 00:54:01,852
who called the agency in Nice?

679
00:54:02,654 --> 00:54:04,692
I’d be on top of things...

680
00:54:05,697 --> 00:54:08,399
if I’d kept your boss locked up.

681
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:11,186
I had the right to detain him.

682
00:54:21,322 --> 00:54:22,483
Don’t leave town

683
00:54:22,739 --> 00:54:24,066
without my permission.

684
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,444
We’re in charge.
And if your murdering boss...

685
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:28,810
He’s innocent!

686
00:54:29,072 --> 00:54:30,860
You’re really stubborn!

687
00:54:31,154 --> 00:54:35,230
How can I convince you we’re dealing
with a dangerous paranoid?

688
00:54:38,862 --> 00:54:40,568
Impressive, aren’t they?

689
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,148
Mme Vercel...

690
00:54:45,571 --> 00:54:48,403
Massoulier’s car as we found it.

691
00:54:50,237 --> 00:54:51,813
Look at the door.

692
00:54:53,487 --> 00:54:55,111
Now see these fingerprints,

693
00:54:55,322 --> 00:54:58,521
the fingers of Vercel’s right hand.

694
00:54:59,405 --> 00:55:00,732
It’s very simple.

695
00:55:01,113 --> 00:55:04,443
As I was leaving,
I saw a car with the lights on.

696
00:55:04,654 --> 00:55:07,938
To be helpful, I put them out
and closed the door

697
00:55:08,155 --> 00:55:09,648
with my hand like this.

698
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:13,396
It would be a miracle
if I’d left no prints!

699
00:55:13,655 --> 00:55:14,982
Did you tell them that?

700
00:55:15,197 --> 00:55:16,820
I couldn’t... I didn’t know.

701
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:20,278
When Santelli showed me
the pictures, I was upset.

702
00:55:20,489 --> 00:55:21,946
Because you’re a ninny!

703
00:55:22,156 --> 00:55:26,232
Besides, why go to the cops?
I told you to see my lawyer.

704
00:55:26,447 --> 00:55:28,070
You’re all mixed up.

705
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,401
You keep on getting me in deeper.

706
00:55:31,447 --> 00:55:34,065
I’m going to call my lawyer.

707
00:55:42,029 --> 00:55:44,517
Let me tell you something first.

708
00:55:44,737 --> 00:55:48,151
Your dear lawyer thinks
you’re guilty.

709
00:55:48,613 --> 00:55:49,691
Did he say so?

710
00:55:49,905 --> 00:55:52,607
He almost did.
True, he adores you.

711
00:55:53,488 --> 00:55:55,976
"My best friend...
my close friend..."

712
00:55:56,863 --> 00:55:58,487
But what he really craves

713
00:55:58,905 --> 00:56:03,278
is a chance to display his eloquence
by pleading a crime of passion.

714
00:56:03,488 --> 00:56:06,155
He said!
"The French adore love affairs...

715
00:56:07,613 --> 00:56:09,568
"I’ll get Julien Vercel acquitted."

716
00:56:10,446 --> 00:56:12,853
You still want to call him?

717
00:56:21,364 --> 00:56:22,312
Look!

718
00:56:23,489 --> 00:56:25,859
Between your lawyer...

719
00:56:26,114 --> 00:56:28,947
and Santelli!
The creep who came here.

720
00:56:29,448 --> 00:56:30,857
The summer camp?

721
00:56:31,073 --> 00:56:32,020
I’m sure of it.

722
00:56:33,614 --> 00:56:34,644
He’s snooping around.

723
00:56:34,864 --> 00:56:37,731
First, he’s there
when they remove the body.

724
00:56:37,946 --> 00:56:40,233
Then, he just happens
to drop in here.

725
00:56:40,821 --> 00:56:42,444
It’s not a coincidence.

726
00:56:42,654 --> 00:56:45,107
Stop scratching your ear!
It’s annoying.

727
00:56:45,654 --> 00:56:47,728
But it helps me to think.

728
00:56:53,405 --> 00:56:55,277
Dial the number
of the Eden Cinema.

729
00:56:55,697 --> 00:56:57,071
You want to see a movie?

730
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,899
No, I want to speak
to the manager.

731
00:57:00,113 --> 00:57:02,781
Massoulier owned it,
so she may know something.

732
00:57:02,989 --> 00:57:06,070
She might know
whom he spoke to last.

733
00:57:10,155 --> 00:57:12,857
<i>The Eden! Next show at 8:30.</i>

734
00:57:13,114 --> 00:57:14,311
Good morning,

735
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:18,027
I’d like to speak to the manager.

736
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:19,697
<i>There is no manager.</i>

737
00:57:21,031 --> 00:57:22,358
Do you know this voice?

738
00:57:22,656 --> 00:57:23,604
I’m not sure.

739
00:57:23,822 --> 00:57:27,106
She’s the nut
who makes those phone calls.

740
00:57:27,323 --> 00:57:29,113
To be sure...

741
00:57:29,407 --> 00:57:32,274
I’ll call back and keep her talking.

742
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,361
I just want to know...

743
00:57:40,572 --> 00:57:42,977
if "Paths of Glory"
is a love story.

744
00:57:43,197 --> 00:57:44,227
<i>It’s a war film</i>

745
00:57:44,488 --> 00:57:47,107
<i>between the French and Germans.</i>

746
00:57:47,946 --> 00:57:50,400
Canons and soldiers.
Are there any women?

747
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:53,770
<i>The soldiers carry photos</i>
<i>of their wives...</i>

748
00:57:54,447 --> 00:57:55,609
So, it’s a love story?

749
00:57:55,864 --> 00:57:58,150
<i>There’s love, battles, songs,</i>

750
00:57:58,405 --> 00:58:00,064
<i>emotions and tutti quanti.</i>

751
00:58:31,449 --> 00:58:32,776
Orchestra or balcony?

752
00:58:35,407 --> 00:58:37,196
It’s about Mr. Massoulier.

753
00:58:37,573 --> 00:58:39,196
The film is half over

754
00:58:39,448 --> 00:58:40,479
but it’s up to you.

755
00:58:40,698 --> 00:58:42,902
Do you know who he met last?

756
00:58:43,491 --> 00:58:44,816
I know who sent you.

757
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,851
If he had any decency,
he would kill himself.

758
00:58:48,114 --> 00:58:51,728
You’re all wrong.
Mr. Vercel isn’t guilty.

759
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:54,194
Don’t be indecent!

760
00:58:59,906 --> 00:59:01,778
He wasn’t the only one.

761
00:59:02,614 --> 00:59:04,900
Many men were drooling
around that bitch.

762
00:59:05,364 --> 00:59:07,485
It turned ugly
when that slut hit town.

763
00:59:07,864 --> 00:59:09,772
Yes, she was a slut!

764
00:59:10,198 --> 00:59:11,360
Go away!

765
00:59:11,573 --> 00:59:12,900
Listen to me!

766
00:59:13,198 --> 00:59:15,865
I too want to know the truth.

767
00:59:16,073 --> 00:59:17,566
Go away!

768
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,774
Either go in, or go out.

769
00:59:40,032 --> 00:59:43,528
I’m just looking at the posters.

770
00:59:44,032 --> 00:59:44,897
This is the lobby...

771
00:59:45,157 --> 00:59:47,360
you’re in the way.

772
00:59:47,864 --> 00:59:50,269
I’m asking you to leave.

773
01:01:19,282 --> 01:01:20,656
- How much?
- What?

774
01:01:20,865 --> 01:01:22,109
How much is it?

775
01:01:22,782 --> 01:01:24,239
It’s past 7:35. p.m.

776
01:01:38,449 --> 01:01:39,693
So, you saw Barbara?

777
01:01:39,907 --> 01:01:41,864
<i>I couldn’t get a word out of her,</i>

778
01:01:42,242 --> 01:01:44,398
but I’m sure she knows a lot!

779
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:47,864
<i>I saw her</i>
<i>leaving the lawyer’s office.</i>

780
01:01:48,366 --> 01:01:49,610
She was hysterical.

781
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:53,944
<i>She just went into a brand new</i>
<i>cabaret, "The Red Angel."</i>

782
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:55,531
I thought that was in Nice.

783
01:01:55,782 --> 01:01:59,230
It’s the same name.
I could hardly believe my eyes.

784
01:01:59,948 --> 01:02:01,606
<i>There’s a restaurant name...</i>

785
01:02:01,906 --> 01:02:03,862
- "Thi Loan."
<i>- A Vietnamese?</i>

786
01:02:05,031 --> 01:02:06,275
We sold the property,

787
01:02:06,532 --> 01:02:07,562
<i>it’s in our files.</i>

788
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,816
She just came out.

789
01:02:11,074 --> 01:02:12,650
<i>What’s her name?</i>

790
01:02:12,865 --> 01:02:15,484
I can’t just walk up
and ask her name.

791
01:02:16,157 --> 01:02:18,147
She’s leaving. I’ll follow her.

792
01:02:19,491 --> 01:02:21,944
Barbara, wait. Be careful!

793
01:03:17,991 --> 01:03:19,483
You’re late, sir.

794
01:03:21,407 --> 01:03:23,944
You’re late and you’re losing
your keys.

795
01:03:25,158 --> 01:03:27,196
Has the rehearsal started?

796
01:03:27,408 --> 01:03:29,066
Are we friends again?

797
01:03:29,283 --> 01:03:31,273
You’re a lunatic!

798
01:03:31,491 --> 01:03:34,158
Why? Because I want
to sleep with you?

799
01:03:34,366 --> 01:03:36,571
Do divorced couples make love?

800
01:03:36,784 --> 01:03:38,442
It happens every day.

801
01:03:38,659 --> 01:03:39,820
What about Genevieve?

802
01:03:40,033 --> 01:03:42,735
She left me because of you.

803
01:03:43,533 --> 01:03:46,200
I said your name
when I slept with her.

804
01:03:50,826 --> 01:03:53,907
Yes, I know,
while you work like angels,

805
01:03:54,159 --> 01:03:56,398
I miss one rehearsal out of two
and we play

806
01:03:56,659 --> 01:03:58,531
next Sunday.
I’ve let you down.

807
01:03:59,909 --> 01:04:02,822
So, either you trust me
to be letter perfect...

808
01:04:03,033 --> 01:04:04,406
or else, replace me...

809
01:04:04,616 --> 01:04:06,108
Is this alright?

810
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:15,108
You’ve got some nerve!

811
01:04:15,866 --> 01:04:17,573
No, she looks just fine.

812
01:04:17,908 --> 01:04:18,856
Very pretty.

813
01:04:19,575 --> 01:04:21,530
Go on!

814
01:04:21,949 --> 01:04:23,490
Don’t mind me.

815
01:04:23,699 --> 01:04:24,943
Go ahead.

816
01:04:25,158 --> 01:04:27,612
"Me hate him? Oh no!

817
01:04:27,825 --> 01:04:29,650
"You’re all wrong.

818
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:32,280
"I’ve admired him all along."

819
01:04:47,909 --> 01:04:50,658
"Berard! He rides past,
his head unbowed."

820
01:04:52,868 --> 01:04:55,949
I’ll run along.
I don’t want to intrude.

821
01:05:00,701 --> 01:05:03,189
"You obviously prefer
"Le Provencal"...

822
01:05:03,492 --> 01:05:06,489
"To our amateur efforts
at rehearsal."

823
01:05:10,033 --> 01:05:13,777
I know the cashier’s name!
It’s Paula Delbeque.

824
01:05:14,158 --> 01:05:15,734
That’s a big help.

825
01:05:17,117 --> 01:05:18,657
What about the "Red Angel" file?

826
01:05:18,867 --> 01:05:20,525
Nothing of interest.

827
01:05:20,825 --> 01:05:24,273
"Mme Loan sold
all of her restaurant stock...

828
01:05:24,492 --> 01:05:28,320
"as follows!
365 shares to Paula Delbeque..."

829
01:05:28,533 --> 01:05:29,279
Look!

830
01:05:29,491 --> 01:05:31,317
Delbeque!
It’s the same name.

831
01:05:32,617 --> 01:05:35,022
I can’t figure it out.

832
01:05:35,825 --> 01:05:40,068
Why would the major stockholder
of a nightclub...

833
01:05:40,284 --> 01:05:43,531
work as a cashier
in a crummy cinema?

834
01:05:43,826 --> 01:05:47,108
It’s vital that I talk to her.

835
01:05:47,326 --> 01:05:48,605
Don’t be crazy!

836
01:05:48,826 --> 01:05:51,658
All the cops have your picture.
Let me go!

837
01:05:51,867 --> 01:05:55,447
You can’t handle it.
Besides, she knows you.

838
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:59,488
She won’t see me.
I’ll sneak into her flat.

839
01:05:59,701 --> 01:06:01,609
If they used her as a cover,

840
01:06:01,826 --> 01:06:05,274
she’s got files. I’ll find them.

841
01:06:05,493 --> 01:06:07,365
Don’t you think I can?

842
01:06:07,576 --> 01:06:10,608
Cut it out?
Who is accused of murder?

843
01:06:10,825 --> 01:06:13,148
I get all the dirty work and...

844
01:06:13,367 --> 01:06:15,238
Stop yelling!

845
01:06:17,575 --> 01:06:18,818
Who can that be?

846
01:06:22,617 --> 01:06:24,074
Don’t answer it.

847
01:06:27,159 --> 01:06:30,110
I won’t. I’ve got to leave.

848
01:06:30,575 --> 01:06:33,360
You’re stubborn, but so am I.

849
01:06:34,243 --> 01:06:37,904
We’re both whispering since
the phone rang.

850
01:06:38,118 --> 01:06:40,108
I borrowed
"Le Provencal" car.

851
01:06:40,326 --> 01:06:42,032
It’s final! I’m telling you...

852
01:06:42,242 --> 01:06:45,489
What? That I’m fired?
That’s already done.

853
01:07:25,659 --> 01:07:27,152
Don’t be afraid, it’s me.

854
01:07:27,368 --> 01:07:30,401
If this is risky,
I should be in on it, right?

855
01:07:31,617 --> 01:07:33,158
It’s really unfair!

856
01:07:33,367 --> 01:07:36,698
If a boss can fire me,
why can’t I fire him?

857
01:07:37,243 --> 01:07:38,901
Keep out of sight.

858
01:07:43,118 --> 01:07:44,990
We’re at the Eden.

859
01:07:45,285 --> 01:07:46,030
I’m slowing down.

860
01:07:48,576 --> 01:07:51,030
Do you recognize the cashier?

861
01:07:51,244 --> 01:07:52,571
I certainly do.

862
01:07:52,785 --> 01:07:56,198
She was Massoulier’s mistress
long ago. It didn’t last.

863
01:07:56,827 --> 01:07:59,031
I assure you she still loves him.

864
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:03,866
She’s stuck there
between the two evening shows.

865
01:08:04,452 --> 01:08:08,316
One hour to search her apartment,
that’s enough to find something.

866
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:12,109
It’s there, on the 4th floor.

867
01:08:19,284 --> 01:08:20,563
I’ll go up and you watch.

868
01:08:20,784 --> 01:08:22,442
No way!
I’ll go and you watch!

869
01:08:22,659 --> 01:08:23,820
Don’t argue.

870
01:08:24,034 --> 01:08:25,278
As you like.

871
01:10:28,285 --> 01:10:30,240
What are you doing here?

872
01:10:50,578 --> 01:10:52,154
I didn’t kill him?

873
01:10:52,536 --> 01:10:53,815
He’s not dead?

874
01:10:54,577 --> 01:10:55,572
He’s breathing.

875
01:10:56,411 --> 01:10:59,325
If we don’t stop him,
he’ll come to real fast.

876
01:10:59,787 --> 01:11:01,612
We must do something.

877
01:11:05,495 --> 01:11:06,241
You know...

878
01:11:07,245 --> 01:11:10,361
this guy...
I’m certain he’s the killer.

879
01:11:10,828 --> 01:11:11,823
Not necessarily.

880
01:11:12,787 --> 01:11:14,612
I’m positive, it’s him.

881
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,691
I’d say there are
9 chances out of 10.

882
01:11:23,828 --> 01:11:27,109
Tying up an unconscious man
isn’t very heroic.

883
01:11:27,452 --> 01:11:29,324
We’re no heroes!

884
01:11:33,744 --> 01:11:34,489
The police?

885
01:11:34,785 --> 01:11:36,361
How about some protection?

886
01:11:36,618 --> 01:11:39,238
Robberies night after night!

887
01:11:39,536 --> 01:11:41,194
57, rue des Recollets,

888
01:11:41,453 --> 01:11:42,566
there’s a customer for you.

889
01:11:43,452 --> 01:11:45,657
What did you do that for?

890
01:11:45,869 --> 01:11:48,618
To accelerate your release.

891
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:07,233
What are you waiting for?

892
01:12:07,745 --> 01:12:09,700
Can you start it?

893
01:12:17,496 --> 01:12:19,570
I’ll handle it.

894
01:12:19,912 --> 01:12:21,867
Look, it’s flooded.

895
01:12:43,286 --> 01:12:44,945
What got into you?

896
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:47,326
I saw it in a movie.

897
01:12:47,536 --> 01:12:51,067
Let’s wait to see how it winds up.

898
01:12:51,286 --> 01:12:53,360
We’ll find out
in the morning paper.

899
01:13:31,204 --> 01:13:32,861
I feel dizzy.

900
01:13:38,036 --> 01:13:38,901
You’re O. K?

901
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:41,786
It’s the first time
I slugged a man.

902
01:13:41,994 --> 01:13:44,115
By the twelfth,
I’ll have the knack.

903
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:49,618
With all what’s happened
in the past two days...

904
01:13:49,828 --> 01:13:53,490
it’s only now I realize
that Marie-Christine’s gone.

905
01:13:54,578 --> 01:13:56,983
I lived with a stranger
for 2 years.

906
01:13:57,746 --> 01:14:01,325
I sensed there was something
wrong, but I ignored it.

907
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:05,405
I wonder why she came here.

908
01:14:05,787 --> 01:14:09,697
- Was she your client at first?
- No, I found the store for her.

909
01:14:11,329 --> 01:14:14,777
She closed her beauty salon
soon after opening it.

910
01:14:15,788 --> 01:14:18,110
She claimed she wanted
to be with me.

911
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:22,569
I liked her, I really did...

912
01:14:23,413 --> 01:14:24,954
you can’t understand.

913
01:14:25,413 --> 01:14:27,534
In that case,
why tell me about it?

914
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:33,737
Death is a strange thing.

915
01:14:34,705 --> 01:14:36,493
When people die of illness...

916
01:14:36,953 --> 01:14:39,987
it’s cruel and unfair,
but it’s really death.

917
01:14:40,495 --> 01:14:42,699
When it’s a crime,
or a killing...

918
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:45,776
death becomes abstract...

919
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:49,785
as if the solution
to the mystery had priority.

920
01:14:50,329 --> 01:14:52,568
It’s like reading a thriller.

921
01:14:53,787 --> 01:14:56,240
And yet Marie-Christine is dead...

922
01:14:57,037 --> 01:14:58,660
and so is Massoulier.

923
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:04,405
From here, our town looks lovely.

924
01:15:07,079 --> 01:15:08,986
When I started in business,

925
01:15:09,204 --> 01:15:11,906
whenever a customer hesitated...
I’d bring him here

926
01:15:12,162 --> 01:15:13,536
to convince him.

927
01:15:13,997 --> 01:15:17,362
Behind those little lights,
there are all sorts of people!

928
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:19,535
Watching TV, night shifts,

929
01:15:19,746 --> 01:15:21,322
sleeping children...

930
01:15:21,996 --> 01:15:23,406
and our killer,

931
01:15:24,163 --> 01:15:26,948
who’ll be sore as hell
when the cops pick him up.

932
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:32,621
No, let me drive.

933
01:15:35,872 --> 01:15:37,246
Why did you kiss me?

934
01:15:37,455 --> 01:15:39,079
There are no cops around.

935
01:15:39,538 --> 01:15:40,532
Who knows!

936
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:42,073
Another riddle.

937
01:16:08,913 --> 01:16:10,536
Just browsing?

938
01:16:11,163 --> 01:16:13,698
I’ll pay, but it’s not worth it.

939
01:16:15,829 --> 01:16:16,991
What do they say?

940
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:18,615
Almost nothing.

941
01:16:19,247 --> 01:16:21,818
"Inquest in double murder
at a standstill."

942
01:16:22,038 --> 01:16:23,152
It’s awful!

943
01:16:23,372 --> 01:16:24,699
We didn’t dream it.

944
01:16:25,663 --> 01:16:27,370
There’s another possibility!

945
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:29,487
The guy we slugged is a big shot

946
01:16:29,705 --> 01:16:32,822
and the cops want
the whole network.

947
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:34,368
What’s that?

948
01:16:34,581 --> 01:16:36,239
It’s for Massoulier’s funeral.

949
01:16:36,831 --> 01:16:39,828
For today?
You’ve got to go, Barbara.

950
01:16:40,039 --> 01:16:43,948
We can’t afford to neglect a lead.

951
01:17:54,829 --> 01:17:56,370
Not this!
I won’t stand it!

952
01:17:57,829 --> 01:18:00,319
Take that wreath away!

953
01:18:03,705 --> 01:18:05,032
We are gathered

954
01:18:05,288 --> 01:18:07,824
to accompany Jacques Massoulier

955
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,324
to his last home.

956
01:18:10,455 --> 01:18:13,987
The mass for his eternal soul
will be offered

957
01:18:14,206 --> 01:18:16,741
by his brother,
Father Claude Massoulier.

958
01:18:20,289 --> 01:18:22,078
"May the peace of Our Lord

959
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:25,578
be with one and all

960
01:18:25,831 --> 01:18:27,537
forever and ever."

961
01:18:30,081 --> 01:18:32,830
I wonder who invented you!

962
01:18:33,206 --> 01:18:36,406
Who said the priest looked
like a killer?

963
01:18:37,123 --> 01:18:39,659
He was investigating on his own.
It was his right.

964
01:18:40,457 --> 01:18:42,198
We’re doing the same thing!

965
01:18:42,415 --> 01:18:43,872
I was wrong to go by looks.

966
01:18:44,123 --> 01:18:46,197
To go by looks!

967
01:18:46,415 --> 01:18:49,746
Even while I was fighting him,

968
01:18:49,957 --> 01:18:52,490
I thought he looked like
a nice guy!

969
01:18:53,622 --> 01:18:55,612
Naturally,
with your imagination...

970
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:58,781
you figure the real killer
looks like a priest.

971
01:19:04,789 --> 01:19:07,787
I’m here for the secretarial job.
The ad in "Le Provencal".

972
01:19:08,330 --> 01:19:12,158
Oh, the ad! Well,
things have happened since then.

973
01:19:12,372 --> 01:19:13,118
You got someone?

974
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:15,156
No, the job is open.

975
01:19:15,498 --> 01:19:16,907
Well, it should be.

976
01:19:17,164 --> 01:19:20,530
May I see the director?

977
01:19:20,748 --> 01:19:23,366
Mr. Vercel is out of town.

978
01:19:24,039 --> 01:19:25,200
For how long?

979
01:19:26,581 --> 01:19:27,743
Don’t you read the papers?

980
01:19:28,248 --> 01:19:31,246
No, the ink smears.
I hate dirty fingers.

981
01:19:31,956 --> 01:19:33,118
Are you a secretary?

982
01:19:33,331 --> 01:19:34,824
I do what I’m told.

983
01:19:35,123 --> 01:19:36,829
You take stenography?

984
01:19:37,331 --> 01:19:39,322
Those pencil notes?

985
01:19:39,623 --> 01:19:40,572
Is it really necessary?

986
01:19:41,332 --> 01:19:43,406
It comes in handy.
Can you type?

987
01:19:44,249 --> 01:19:45,196
How fast?

988
01:19:45,415 --> 01:19:48,247
I type, but I’m no speed demon.

989
01:19:49,082 --> 01:19:51,451
I type with one finger.

990
01:19:51,665 --> 01:19:53,075
Only one finger?

991
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:54,239
This one.

992
01:19:54,705 --> 01:19:55,535
It’s enough.

993
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:57,074
Let me show you.

994
01:20:09,539 --> 01:20:10,569
Fantastic!

995
01:20:12,539 --> 01:20:13,534
And you’re a blonde.

996
01:20:13,831 --> 01:20:15,110
Yes, I am. So what?

997
01:20:15,331 --> 01:20:16,574
It’s an asset.

998
01:20:16,831 --> 01:20:18,288
Mr. Vercel hates brunettes.

999
01:20:18,582 --> 01:20:19,955
In fact, he fired me.

1000
01:20:20,665 --> 01:20:22,157
I’m leaving.

1001
01:20:22,415 --> 01:20:26,243
Maybe he has other reasons.

1002
01:20:26,498 --> 01:20:28,405
He may want
to rejuvenate his staff!

1003
01:20:30,331 --> 01:20:32,536
Thanks, I feel better.

1004
01:20:33,915 --> 01:20:35,953
It’s a pity Mr. Vercel’s away.

1005
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:39,163
He’d be very interested in you.

1006
01:20:39,373 --> 01:20:41,328
I’ll leave you my phone number.

1007
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:42,784
He can call me.

1008
01:20:42,998 --> 01:20:45,535
Almost 4 p.m.
I’ve got to run.

1009
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:57,112
A bill, another one...

1010
01:20:57,581 --> 01:20:59,038
publicity... Ah!

1011
01:20:59,331 --> 01:21:00,160
What is it?

1012
01:21:00,372 --> 01:21:03,323
Nothing. An anonymous letter.

1013
01:21:03,539 --> 01:21:04,404
Let’s see.

1014
01:21:04,622 --> 01:21:06,696
- It’s for me.
- I want to see it.

1015
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:15,493
"You little intriguer, why don’t
you mind your own business?"

1016
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:18,161
See, "little intriguer".

1017
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:20,280
When I say it,
you don’t believe me.

1018
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,698
We’re not getting anywhere.

1019
01:21:29,832 --> 01:21:33,078
All we’ve done in 3 days
is to bash a priest...

1020
01:21:33,290 --> 01:21:35,080
and to get anonymous filth.

1021
01:21:35,291 --> 01:21:37,365
Do you want to turn yourself in?

1022
01:21:37,582 --> 01:21:39,952
Never! I’d rather die.

1023
01:21:40,707 --> 01:21:44,322
But we’ve got no more leads.

1024
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:46,412
I’ve got a lead.

1025
01:21:46,624 --> 01:21:48,698
It’s the "Red Angel."

1026
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:49,745
First...

1027
01:21:50,916 --> 01:21:53,286
The Eden is
a crummy movie house

1028
01:21:53,499 --> 01:21:56,166
that conceals a chain of cabarets.

1029
01:21:57,208 --> 01:21:57,704
Second...

1030
01:21:58,124 --> 01:22:01,987
The cabarets conceal
a prostitution ring.

1031
01:22:02,206 --> 01:22:02,988
When a hooker

1032
01:22:03,248 --> 01:22:08,320
is arrested,
she’s released within the hour.

1033
01:22:08,956 --> 01:22:11,658
Because her working card says

1034
01:22:11,873 --> 01:22:14,160
she’s a hostess
for "The Red Angel."

1035
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:16,119
Thanks to Louison...

1036
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:17,908
I’ll bore from within.

1037
01:22:18,123 --> 01:22:19,782
What does Louison do?

1038
01:22:22,165 --> 01:22:24,570
The oldest profession in the world.

1039
01:22:24,831 --> 01:22:25,413
You know her?

1040
01:22:25,957 --> 01:22:26,952
Almost.

1041
01:22:28,207 --> 01:22:30,162
But thanks to her...

1042
01:22:31,332 --> 01:22:34,780
we’ll find out what
Paula Delbeque won’t tell us.

1043
01:22:37,874 --> 01:22:40,825
Do I look plausible?

1044
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:43,245
Plausible as what?

1045
01:22:46,291 --> 01:22:48,412
That’s all I wanted to know.

1046
01:23:13,623 --> 01:23:14,902
Got a light?

1047
01:23:16,416 --> 01:23:18,489
Do you wear pantyhose?

1048
01:23:18,749 --> 01:23:19,697
No, stockings.

1049
01:23:19,915 --> 01:23:21,408
Then, let’s go up.

1050
01:23:21,624 --> 01:23:22,903
No way!

1051
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:24,119
Why not?

1052
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:27,532
It’s your mustache.
I can’t stand it.

1053
01:23:27,748 --> 01:23:29,290
Try another girl.

1054
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:37,328
Who is she?

1055
01:23:37,541 --> 01:23:38,950
She turned me down.

1056
01:23:39,166 --> 01:23:40,114
Hear that?

1057
01:23:40,332 --> 01:23:43,497
The new one picks her johns.

1058
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:45,624
I’ll handle her.

1059
01:23:53,416 --> 01:23:54,826
This is our beat.

1060
01:23:55,042 --> 01:23:57,163
Louison told me to work here.

1061
01:23:58,084 --> 01:23:59,078
Let’s find out.

1062
01:23:59,292 --> 01:24:01,081
Right, let’s go ask Louison.

1063
01:24:01,292 --> 01:24:02,571
Let’s go.

1064
01:24:16,124 --> 01:24:19,536
What do you plan to do
about the lights?

1065
01:24:20,916 --> 01:24:22,823
You getting cold feet?

1066
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:24,949
Because customers...

1067
01:24:25,291 --> 01:24:26,535
Excuse me.

1068
01:24:29,041 --> 01:24:30,866
What are you doing here?

1069
01:24:31,291 --> 01:24:33,958
You’re not supposed
to come inside.

1070
01:24:34,166 --> 01:24:37,413
There’s a mix-up.
She says you hired her.

1071
01:24:37,625 --> 01:24:40,078
We’d never hire a brunette.

1072
01:24:40,291 --> 01:24:43,289
They don’t make enough
to buy new shoes.

1073
01:24:43,499 --> 01:24:45,704
She says Louison hired her.

1074
01:24:45,917 --> 01:24:47,078
You know Louison?

1075
01:24:47,292 --> 01:24:48,785
Yes, I know her.

1076
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:49,913
You know her?

1077
01:24:50,125 --> 01:24:52,116
I know her and she knows me.

1078
01:24:52,333 --> 01:24:53,874
Where did you meet?

1079
01:24:54,083 --> 01:24:55,327
In Nice. I worked there.

1080
01:24:55,542 --> 01:24:59,323
She suggested I come...
and work for her here.

1081
01:25:01,876 --> 01:25:03,119
Louison said that?

1082
01:25:03,334 --> 01:25:04,708
Yes, she did.

1083
01:25:06,375 --> 01:25:09,622
Louison, a visitor!

1084
01:25:15,082 --> 01:25:16,492
What is it?

1085
01:25:17,332 --> 01:25:19,619
This broad says you hired her.

1086
01:25:20,499 --> 01:25:21,908
Have we met?

1087
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:29,659
I didn’t hire her.

1088
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:31,451
I don’t know you.

1089
01:25:31,666 --> 01:25:34,119
And she thought
you were a dame.

1090
01:25:35,291 --> 01:25:36,950
Me, a dame?

1091
01:25:44,167 --> 01:25:45,245
I’ve been called

1092
01:25:45,458 --> 01:25:47,662
lots of things, but till now...

1093
01:25:47,875 --> 01:25:50,494
no one’s ever called me a dame!

1094
01:25:50,709 --> 01:25:51,870
The things you hear...

1095
01:25:53,209 --> 01:25:55,875
"DELBEQUE-MASSOULIER, INC."

1096
01:25:56,084 --> 01:25:58,489
Do you have a cigarette?
A light?

1097
01:25:58,709 --> 01:26:02,241
You want me to puff it for you?
Beat it!

1098
01:26:10,376 --> 01:26:12,829
Wait till we’re alone.

1099
01:26:13,042 --> 01:26:14,534
Hey, you!

1100
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,204
You can’t hang around here.

1101
01:26:17,416 --> 01:26:18,957
On your way!

1102
01:26:19,166 --> 01:26:22,911
Go on to Marseilles.
There’s lots of work there.

1103
01:26:29,167 --> 01:26:30,280
...And the platform goes down.

1104
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,621
The platform goes down
and the girls up!

1105
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:58,208
You feel better?
No hard feelings?

1106
01:26:58,418 --> 01:26:59,958
No, you were right.

1107
01:27:00,168 --> 01:27:01,874
I was wrong.

1108
01:27:02,667 --> 01:27:05,666
But I’m scarred...
so I only get 100 Frs.

1109
01:27:06,668 --> 01:27:08,410
That’s less income...

1110
01:27:08,793 --> 01:27:11,957
so you’ll have to work more.

1111
01:27:17,502 --> 01:27:20,249
Thank you.
But I’ve got no right to accept it.

1112
01:27:20,458 --> 01:27:23,658
Since when are you so virtuous?

1113
01:27:41,958 --> 01:27:43,073
<i>Get me Louison.</i>

1114
01:27:43,293 --> 01:27:45,497
I’ll get my brother.

1115
01:27:46,168 --> 01:27:47,246
It’s Paula!

1116
01:27:47,459 --> 01:27:48,621
Coming.

1117
01:27:51,917 --> 01:27:53,742
<i>He’s coming to see you.</i>

1118
01:27:53,959 --> 01:27:55,238
No kidding!

1119
01:27:55,585 --> 01:27:56,497
Are you sure?

1120
01:27:56,710 --> 01:27:57,788
<i>Yes.</i>

1121
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:03,288
Let me take this call upstairs.
Hold on.

1122
01:28:03,501 --> 01:28:04,496
OK.

1123
01:28:21,584 --> 01:28:24,203
I’ve got the letters.
He’ll have to pay.

1124
01:28:24,709 --> 01:28:26,664
- <i>What will you do?</i>
- Don’t worry,

1125
01:28:26,875 --> 01:28:29,162
I won’t mention you.

1126
01:28:29,709 --> 01:28:31,664
It’ll soon be over.

1127
01:28:36,084 --> 01:28:37,743
Oh, it’s you? Come in.

1128
01:28:42,709 --> 01:28:45,244
They were well hidden.

1129
01:28:45,876 --> 01:28:47,369
I looked all over.

1130
01:28:47,585 --> 01:28:48,959
You can stop worrying.

1131
01:28:49,168 --> 01:28:50,744
You know where I found them?

1132
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:53,116
They were in a shoe box!

1133
01:28:55,293 --> 01:28:56,572
How about a bonus?

1134
01:28:58,043 --> 01:28:59,323
I kept a few.

1135
01:29:24,503 --> 01:29:25,496
Who was it?

1136
01:29:25,709 --> 01:29:28,198
Tell me his name.
It was a man?

1137
01:29:28,417 --> 01:29:30,622
Warn Paula...

1138
01:29:31,667 --> 01:29:32,864
Hurry!

1139
01:30:13,085 --> 01:30:14,827
I must see Mr. Clement.

1140
01:30:15,044 --> 01:30:18,327
He’s usually here at this time,
but today he’s out.

1141
01:30:18,544 --> 01:30:21,661
It’s strange, he didn’t call.
You can wait here.

1142
01:30:43,793 --> 01:30:45,831
BEAUTY SALON TO RENT

1143
01:30:46,043 --> 01:30:47,915
I’ll wait in his office.

1144
01:30:52,876 --> 01:30:54,251
Is the boss back?

1145
01:30:54,461 --> 01:30:57,873
It’s the dame from
the Vercel agency. She’s nervy!

1146
01:30:58,086 --> 01:30:59,626
She crashed his office.

1147
01:30:59,835 --> 01:31:03,663
- You let her?
- She just bolted past me!

1148
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:14,617
Hello?

1149
01:32:25,545 --> 01:32:27,038
What happened?

1150
01:32:42,169 --> 01:32:44,917
One! Massoulier.
Two! Vercel’s wife.

1151
01:32:45,127 --> 01:32:48,707
Three! The Eden cashier.
Bodies right and left.

1152
01:32:48,919 --> 01:32:50,578
Make up your mind.

1153
01:32:50,794 --> 01:32:52,915
Are you with us or against us?

1154
01:33:06,336 --> 01:33:08,907
<i>And now, a third murder.</i>

1155
01:33:09,128 --> 01:33:12,624
<i>Following the shooting</i>
<i>of Jacques Massoulier...</i>

1156
01:33:12,836 --> 01:33:16,249
<i>and the killing</i>
<i>of Marie-Christine Vercel...</i>

1157
01:33:16,670 --> 01:33:20,616
<i>the latest victim is</i>
<i>the cashier of the Eden...</i>

1158
01:33:20,837 --> 01:33:24,960
<i>stabbed to death an hour ago</i>
<i>in the darkened cinema.</i>

1159
01:33:25,754 --> 01:33:30,411
<i>The circumstantial evidence</i>
<i>points to Julien Vercel...</i>

1160
01:33:30,629 --> 01:33:32,536
<i>who disappeared 3 days ago.</i>

1161
01:33:32,754 --> 01:33:36,202
<i>A city-wide search</i>
<i>is under way for Vercel.</i>

1162
01:33:36,420 --> 01:33:38,162
<i>The police blocked</i>
<i>all the city exists.</i>

1163
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:42,074
<i>The killer’s arrest is imminent.</i>

1164
01:33:49,461 --> 01:33:52,246
- Mr. Clement, please.
- Hold on.

1165
01:33:52,461 --> 01:33:54,950
I’ve got to see you right away.

1166
01:34:19,004 --> 01:34:20,876
Did you hear the radio?

1167
01:34:21,379 --> 01:34:24,246
This is goodbye.
Thanks for everything.

1168
01:34:24,462 --> 01:34:28,159
You did your best.
You meant well.

1169
01:34:28,795 --> 01:34:31,711
I’ve got to go now.

1170
01:34:31,921 --> 01:34:33,083
To the police?

1171
01:34:33,296 --> 01:34:35,417
No, I’m going to see my lawyer.

1172
01:34:35,629 --> 01:34:39,326
You’re made!
There are roadblocks all over.

1173
01:34:39,546 --> 01:34:42,792
I’ll go by the sea.
My lawyer set it up.

1174
01:34:43,003 --> 01:34:44,579
Please,

1175
01:34:45,211 --> 01:34:47,451
listen to me...

1176
01:34:47,794 --> 01:34:49,074
don’t leave.

1177
01:34:49,294 --> 01:34:50,870
I know what I’m doing.

1178
01:34:53,003 --> 01:34:54,580
Or take me with you.

1179
01:34:54,795 --> 01:34:56,205
Impossible.

1180
01:34:56,837 --> 01:34:58,993
Because you despise me?

1181
01:34:59,212 --> 01:35:00,953
I don’t despise you.

1182
01:35:01,170 --> 01:35:03,160
Well, I despise you...

1183
01:35:03,503 --> 01:35:05,079
and moreover...

1184
01:35:06,586 --> 01:35:08,080
I love you.

1185
01:35:08,754 --> 01:35:10,875
A blind man could see that!

1186
01:35:11,087 --> 01:35:13,291
You’ve never looked
at me as a woman.

1187
01:35:13,504 --> 01:35:16,916
Since I’m not a platinum blonde
with fake eye lashes,

1188
01:35:17,129 --> 01:35:19,000
I haven’t got a chance!

1189
01:36:13,046 --> 01:36:15,914
Ask me the question
you asked before.

1190
01:36:17,296 --> 01:36:18,326
I’m asking you.

1191
01:36:18,546 --> 01:36:20,086
The answer is yes.

1192
01:36:20,296 --> 01:36:21,290
You’re taking me?

1193
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:24,289
No, I need 24 hours.
I’ll call you tomorrow...

1194
01:36:25,463 --> 01:36:27,086
and you’ll join me.

1195
01:36:28,338 --> 01:36:32,627
I feel like a complete idiot.
Does it mean I’m in love?

1196
01:36:33,630 --> 01:36:37,375
I’ve felt that way
for the past 6 months.

1197
01:36:41,089 --> 01:36:42,498
I can’t wait.

1198
01:36:43,047 --> 01:36:44,421
Wait for what?

1199
01:36:46,338 --> 01:36:48,578
Wait for next Sunday.

1200
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:00,998
Hear that?

1201
01:37:01,212 --> 01:37:03,287
I hear nothing.

1202
01:37:04,796 --> 01:37:07,580
It’s not normal.
We always hear street noises.

1203
01:37:08,004 --> 01:37:09,331
Take a look.

1204
01:37:20,505 --> 01:37:21,535
It’s quiet.

1205
01:37:23,213 --> 01:37:24,753
Everything’s alright.

1206
01:37:28,297 --> 01:37:30,785
It’s been two minutes
since I kissed you.

1207
01:37:34,672 --> 01:37:36,709
I know who the killer is.

1208
01:37:47,214 --> 01:37:49,169
Good work!

1209
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:53,212
You’ve been despicable
all along!

1210
01:38:08,505 --> 01:38:12,166
I didn’t kill Massoulier,
I didn’t kill my wife...

1211
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:15,626
I didn’t kill the Eden cashier.

1212
01:38:15,838 --> 01:38:17,913
Is that your story?

1213
01:38:18,130 --> 01:38:22,420
We could write
a book about your wife.

1214
01:38:22,963 --> 01:38:26,578
Did you know she married you
under a false name?

1215
01:38:26,963 --> 01:38:28,290
You’re real funny.

1216
01:38:28,505 --> 01:38:31,041
It’s no laughing matter.

1217
01:38:31,256 --> 01:38:32,997
Your marriage isn’t valid...

1218
01:38:33,214 --> 01:38:36,911
because under her real name
of Josiane Kerbel...

1219
01:38:37,130 --> 01:38:40,827
was married
to a Belgian horse trainer.

1220
01:38:41,339 --> 01:38:44,503
He went to jail for doping a horse.

1221
01:38:44,715 --> 01:38:47,416
He always claimed she did it.

1222
01:38:47,798 --> 01:38:50,203
Meanwhile, she was living it up.

1223
01:38:50,423 --> 01:38:54,286
An ex-lover was blackmailing her,
so she drove to France.

1224
01:38:54,506 --> 01:38:58,664
She got drunk
and ran over a soldier.

1225
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:01,368
She drove off
leaving him to die on the road.

1226
01:39:01,588 --> 01:39:03,211
So aside from Interpol,

1227
01:39:03,421 --> 01:39:07,746
insurance companies
were on her trail. Here you are!

1228
01:39:09,547 --> 01:39:11,537
We’ve got your client...

1229
01:39:11,755 --> 01:39:14,919
and all your legal
wiles won’t get him out.

1230
01:39:15,130 --> 01:39:18,661
Let me go on
with the report on his wife.

1231
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:20,870
It’s very interesting.

1232
01:39:21,088 --> 01:39:23,873
We’ll skip the rubber checks.

1233
01:39:24,089 --> 01:39:28,497
She lands in Nice
and opens a beauty salon.

1234
01:39:28,714 --> 01:39:32,162
When you married her,
she heaved a sigh of relief!

1235
01:39:32,380 --> 01:39:36,588
She needed to lie low at that time.
How’s that?

1236
01:39:36,798 --> 01:39:38,338
It’s still funny.

1237
01:39:38,548 --> 01:39:40,503
Yes, she needed time...

1238
01:39:40,714 --> 01:39:43,499
but with Massoulier around,
it wasn’t easy.

1239
01:39:43,714 --> 01:39:47,163
I never speak ill of the dead...

1240
01:39:47,382 --> 01:39:51,375
but if it wasn’t for Massoulier,
all this mess...

1241
01:39:54,506 --> 01:39:57,623
Little boys play with toy railroads,

1242
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:00,920
stations, houses, cars, garages.

1243
01:40:01,130 --> 01:40:05,254
Later on, they find out they can’t
all belong to one man.

1244
01:40:05,463 --> 01:40:08,461
They learn to share,
to go into partnership.

1245
01:40:09,046 --> 01:40:11,203
Massoulier had remained
a little boy!

1246
01:40:12,297 --> 01:40:14,501
He wanted the beauty salon,

1247
01:40:14,714 --> 01:40:18,754
the cinema, the cabaret,
the brothels, he wanted them all!

1248
01:40:18,964 --> 01:40:23,420
Damn it! I remind you that 3 persons
were killed after Massoulier.

1249
01:40:23,630 --> 01:40:28,205
So there’s another little boy
in this town who refused to grow up!

1250
01:40:31,881 --> 01:40:34,452
I must see Mr. Santelli!

1251
01:40:34,881 --> 01:40:37,085
Excuse me for interrupting...

1252
01:40:37,297 --> 01:40:39,502
but I’ve got some information.

1253
01:40:39,715 --> 01:40:40,627
Busybody!

1254
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:42,249
Let her talk.

1255
01:40:42,465 --> 01:40:45,830
All leads are useful at that point.

1256
01:40:49,214 --> 01:40:52,498
A detective agency
in Nice was hired

1257
01:40:52,715 --> 01:40:55,630
to investigate on
Marie-Christine’s past.

1258
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:59,585
It was a phone request
by an unknown client.

1259
01:40:59,798 --> 01:41:01,670
Yes, it’s in the file.

1260
01:41:01,882 --> 01:41:05,163
Well, I decided to call
the Nice agency...

1261
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:07,537
and I learned that the client...

1262
01:41:07,964 --> 01:41:11,080
sent them a picture
of Marie-Christine

1263
01:41:11,297 --> 01:41:12,837
in a typed envelope.

1264
01:41:13,047 --> 01:41:14,587
Do you have the envelope?

1265
01:41:14,797 --> 01:41:17,464
If I get it,
can you identify it?

1266
01:41:17,673 --> 01:41:20,670
In 3 days, I can trace
any typewriter owner.

1267
01:41:20,881 --> 01:41:22,836
Wait...

1268
01:41:23,964 --> 01:41:25,540
The detective has just left home.

1269
01:41:25,756 --> 01:41:28,125
By now,
he should be in the office

1270
01:41:28,340 --> 01:41:30,461
searching for the envelope.

1271
01:41:30,673 --> 01:41:33,624
As soon as he does,
he’ll call us here.

1272
01:41:34,048 --> 01:41:36,962
I gave him your phone number.

1273
01:41:37,881 --> 01:41:42,172
Thank you for your cooperation.

1274
01:41:42,382 --> 01:41:44,040
You may go now.

1275
01:41:49,173 --> 01:41:53,001
May I read
my client’s statement?

1276
01:41:53,423 --> 01:41:54,703
Certainly.

1277
01:41:59,007 --> 01:42:01,128
It’s short and sweet!

1278
01:42:01,757 --> 01:42:04,625
"I didn’t kill Massoulier,
nor my wife.

1279
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:08,536
"I didn’t kill Louison,
or the Eden cashier."

1280
01:42:08,923 --> 01:42:10,878
It’s not much help.

1281
01:42:20,423 --> 01:42:21,797
<i>Santelli speaking.</i>

1282
01:42:23,881 --> 01:42:25,291
I don’t know. I’m busy.

1283
01:42:25,506 --> 01:42:26,916
I’m tied up here

1284
01:42:27,256 --> 01:42:28,630
for at least an hour.

1285
01:42:28,839 --> 01:42:30,462
It’s very simple, honey.

1286
01:42:33,049 --> 01:42:35,122
<i>Use the potatoes while they’re hot.</i>

1287
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:38,291
<i>You may burn your fingers,</i>
<i>but never mind.</i>

1288
01:42:38,507 --> 01:42:39,750
I get it, darling.

1289
01:42:39,965 --> 01:42:41,588
Then, you pour the white wine

1290
01:42:41,798 --> 01:42:42,995
on the potatoes,

1291
01:42:43,215 --> 01:42:45,088
but slice them thin. Got it?

1292
01:42:45,299 --> 01:42:49,245
Yes, but hurry because
the kids have to go to school.

1293
01:42:49,466 --> 01:42:51,456
The table’s set and we’re waiting.

1294
01:42:51,674 --> 01:42:52,622
Cut it out...

1295
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:54,416
I need the line

1296
01:42:54,632 --> 01:42:56,457
for an important call.
Bye, darling.

1297
01:42:59,924 --> 01:43:01,832
It was my old lady.

1298
01:43:08,966 --> 01:43:10,045
What are you doing?

1299
01:43:13,006 --> 01:43:15,044
Your conversation made me hungry.

1300
01:43:15,756 --> 01:43:17,794
I’ll just hop out for a sandwich.

1301
01:43:18,631 --> 01:43:20,172
They can send someone for it.

1302
01:43:20,673 --> 01:43:23,162
I prefer to take a walk.

1303
01:43:27,548 --> 01:43:28,662
Come with me.

1304
01:43:30,465 --> 01:43:32,502
- Don’t lose him.
- OK.

1305
01:43:35,591 --> 01:43:37,747
Is Lablache still on the line?

1306
01:43:37,966 --> 01:43:38,711
He’s on hold.

1307
01:43:40,674 --> 01:43:44,253
It looks as if my lawyer will be
needing a good lawyer.

1308
01:43:44,465 --> 01:43:47,333
Hold on, Mr. Lablache,
Mr. Santelli wants to talk to you.

1309
01:43:49,383 --> 01:43:51,587
Lablache? Santelli speaking.

1310
01:43:51,799 --> 01:43:53,340
<i>I’m still here.</i>

1311
01:43:53,716 --> 01:43:57,461
It’s working as planned.
He just left. He’s about to call you.

1312
01:43:57,841 --> 01:44:00,246
Tell me what I should say.

1313
01:44:00,466 --> 01:44:03,914
Just keep him talking
till he hangs himself.

1314
01:44:04,342 --> 01:44:05,206
I’ll hang up.

1315
01:44:05,425 --> 01:44:07,499
<i>Fine. We’ll both hang up!</i>

1316
01:44:09,425 --> 01:44:11,711
Come down, Miss-know-it-all!

1317
01:44:12,133 --> 01:44:14,964
She did well in the role of my wife.

1318
01:44:15,173 --> 01:44:17,413
We had to needle the lawyer.

1319
01:44:17,632 --> 01:44:20,416
Did you see him
with those cigarettes?

1320
01:44:20,632 --> 01:44:23,380
I planned to nail him...

1321
01:44:23,590 --> 01:44:25,829
while he was helping me run away.

1322
01:44:26,049 --> 01:44:28,751
- He could’ve killed you.
- It’s true.

1323
01:44:29,216 --> 01:44:31,289
When did you suspect him?

1324
01:44:31,507 --> 01:44:35,168
I never trusted him
since he handled my divorce.

1325
01:44:35,382 --> 01:44:37,040
I had to slap him down.

1326
01:44:37,257 --> 01:44:38,916
What for?

1327
01:44:39,133 --> 01:44:42,415
To make him
remove his hand from my bra.

1328
01:44:42,633 --> 01:44:45,666
A groping hand doesn’t
always mean a killer...

1329
01:44:46,299 --> 01:44:49,048
Or else,
Jambrau’d be in jail for life.

1330
01:44:49,799 --> 01:44:50,912
OK,

1331
01:44:51,717 --> 01:44:54,963
but while I was waiting
in his office...

1332
01:44:56,008 --> 01:44:59,456
I noticed something suspicious.

1333
01:45:16,050 --> 01:45:19,461
I leaned against the wall.

1334
01:45:36,382 --> 01:45:40,458
It led to Marie-Christine’s
former beauty salon.

1335
01:45:40,674 --> 01:45:45,000
A fantastic gimmick
to have a secret affair

1336
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:46,590
in a small town.

1337
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:50,793
I also noticed a card
from the Lablache agency

1338
01:45:53,883 --> 01:45:57,332
and a picture of Marie-Christine
in Clement’s arms.

1339
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:59,791
It all added up.

1340
01:46:01,675 --> 01:46:05,254
He’s just gone
into to phone booth!

1341
01:46:08,342 --> 01:46:10,001
Lablache speaking.

1342
01:46:10,217 --> 01:46:13,132
Last week,
I requested a little inquest.

1343
01:46:14,342 --> 01:46:16,498
I mailed you a picture
in an envelope.

1344
01:46:16,717 --> 01:46:19,122
<i>I see.</i>
<i>I just got to the office.</i>

1345
01:46:19,342 --> 01:46:21,332
I don’t know if it’s still here.

1346
01:46:21,716 --> 01:46:23,790
I’m pretty sure
it’s been destroyed.

1347
01:46:24,341 --> 01:46:26,580
<i>Mr. Lablache,</i>
<i>are you a gambler?</i>

1348
01:46:26,799 --> 01:46:28,422
When the odds are good.

1349
01:46:28,632 --> 01:46:32,578
I’ll bet a handsome amount
you won’t find that envelope.

1350
01:46:32,799 --> 01:46:35,371
What do you mean
by handsome amount?

1351
01:46:36,758 --> 01:46:37,587
15,000 Frs.

1352
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:40,122
But destroying evidence...

1353
01:46:40,341 --> 01:46:41,419
Who says it’s evidence?

1354
01:46:41,799 --> 01:46:43,458
<i>You simply won’t find...</i>

1355
01:46:43,674 --> 01:46:46,543
an envelope that was discarded

1356
01:46:46,759 --> 01:46:48,879
<i>in a wastebasket 3 days ago.</i>

1357
01:46:49,217 --> 01:46:51,089
I’m willing to bet 30,000 Frs.

1358
01:46:51,550 --> 01:46:53,043
It’s my final price.

1359
01:47:03,759 --> 01:47:05,133
Forget all I said.

1360
01:47:07,342 --> 01:47:09,249
<i>You were putting me on.</i>

1361
01:47:09,467 --> 01:47:11,921
The die is cast!

1362
01:47:12,135 --> 01:47:13,675
Give the envelope to the cops...

1363
01:47:13,884 --> 01:47:16,882
but keep Marie-Christine’s picture.

1364
01:47:17,509 --> 01:47:19,630
I killed her
because she no longer loved me,

1365
01:47:19,843 --> 01:47:21,632
Massoulier
because she asked me to.

1366
01:47:21,842 --> 01:47:23,964
I killed Paula
because she guessed the truth

1367
01:47:24,177 --> 01:47:26,663
and Louison
because he was blackmailing me.

1368
01:47:27,258 --> 01:47:29,000
I was about to kill Vercel.

1369
01:47:30,174 --> 01:47:33,622
I don’t belong
to the brotherhood of men.

1370
01:47:33,841 --> 01:47:36,080
Everything
I’ve done was for women.

1371
01:47:36,299 --> 01:47:39,796
I like to look at them
and to touch them.

1372
01:47:40,342 --> 01:47:42,581
I enjoy giving them pleasure.

1373
01:47:44,592 --> 01:47:48,964
Women are magic,
so I became a magician.

1374
01:47:49,176 --> 01:47:52,588
In one minute,
there’ll be another corpse here.

1375
01:47:55,342 --> 01:47:57,214
I see them approaching.

1376
01:47:57,800 --> 01:47:59,590
Sorry to let you down,

1377
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:01,625
you’ve just lost 30,000 Frs.

1378
01:48:02,305 --> 01:49:02,765

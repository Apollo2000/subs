2
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,180
What is this again?

3
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,980
Don't you have other things to do
besides this?

4
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,600
Sorry sir,
this lane is closed temporarily.

5
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,060
You can turn around
through the other way.

6
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,500
Please understand.

7
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,160
Go on.

8
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,100
But I'm gonna be late!

9
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,900
This is a very important order package.

10
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,450
If this package is not
delivered on time...

11
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,280
Who do you think will be responsible?!

12
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,840
Geez, Okay. Just be quick, all right?

13
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,000
You can pass.

14
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,240
Come on.

15
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,440
What a really bad day...

16
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,240
Rough morning. What more...

17
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,900
Dammit!

18
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,100
Dammit!

19
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,200
As if anything else could go worse!

20
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,400
"TRAIN TO BUSAN"

21
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,160
Sunbaenim,

22
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,500
statistical data companies showed
abnormal stock market returns.

23
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,040
What we need is to take action
as soon as possible.

24
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,260
In order to secure our
position in this stock market.

25
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,860
Yes.

26
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,000
Thank you for the instructions.

27
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,360
I will do it as soon as possible.

28
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,260
Yes.

29
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,460
It will be done as you wish.

30
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,180
Yeah yeah.

31
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,160
Have a nice day!

32
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,100
Come into my office.

33
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,480
Yes, director?

34
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,880
Secure all of our assets
in the stock market.

35
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,400
All of them?

36
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:53,400
Yes.

37
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,160
Is it not too risky to do this?

38
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,350
We could still maintain
our first assets...

39
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,300
and wait if something better comes...

40
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,040
Mr. Kim...

41
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,360
Yes sir?

42
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
You just do what I tell you to do.

43
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
We must be careful of the
possibilities that may happen.

44
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,480
Yes sir.

45
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,760
One more thing Mr Kim...

46
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,340
What's the popular
gift for kids nowadays?

47
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,300
<i>Forget it. You really can't be a good dad to
Soo-an. You didn't even attend her recital.</i>

48
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,240
You know I'm busy at work.

49
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,340
She can stay here in Seoul with me.

50
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,900
<i>Just send her here in Busan!</i>

51
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,900
<i>You've already broke your promises!</i>

52
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,040
<i>How many times have you told her
you'll come come with her.</i>

53
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,900
<i>Can you keep it just this once?</i>

54
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,900
Yes, I promise we'll go there soon!

55
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,900
<i>I don't believe you.</i>

56
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,740
Take my word for it.

57
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,800
<i>Anyway you have to keep your promise.</i>

58
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,900
<i>Our daughter is tired
of your broken promises.</i>

59
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,200
Nevermind, talk to you later.

60
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,980
<i>You know that its her
birthday tomorrow right?</i>

61
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,440
I know!

62
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,720
Let me help you with that.

63
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,120
Thank you.

64
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,460
How is she?

65
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,740
She's playing in her room.

66
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,060
When are we going there?
Don't know when.

67
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,300
Mom doesn't talk to Dad, huh?

68
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,600
I have to go. Dad is here.

69
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,700
Soo-ann why are you awake?

70
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,300
I can't sleep

71
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,660
Your mom and I talked.

72
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,520
I promised your mom we'd go together.

73
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,240
But before that there are things
I have to do...

74
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,300
Soo-an you have to be patient.

75
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,300
Open it.

76
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,500
You thought I forgot? Happy birthday.

77
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,600
Open it now.

78
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,660
What's wrong... Don't you like it?

79
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,800
Could you replace this one?

80
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,000
Maybe we could?

81
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,900
What do you want?

82
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,640
Busan.

83
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,300
I want to go to mom at Busan.

84
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,700
Tomorrow.

85
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,760
Yeah, just wait.

86
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,160
We'll certainly go there once
your dad is done with work.

87
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,000
No.

88
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,360
Tomorrow.

89
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,100
You always make promises you can't keep.

90
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,800
We have to go tomorrow no matter what.

91
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,320
Are you not tired of working
all the time?

92
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,500
Grant my wish for once.

93
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,700
What did your daughter said?

94
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,000
She wants us to have a vacation.

95
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,000
Does she want to go to Busan?

96
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,520
Yes.

97
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,020
Since the divorce,
she loves you both less.

98
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,200
She misses the times when her parents
were still together.

99
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,260
As if she wants her
family reunited again.

100
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,900
There's nothing wrong with your family
being reunited again.

101
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,540
Try it this time so your family
is back together again.

102
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,380
Ma...

103
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,940
I do not want to talk about it...

104
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,020
Let it be the past...

105
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,240
Okay.

106
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,140
Don't be too busy with work...

107
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,160
Sometimes you should not always
focus on work. Soo-an is growing up.

108
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,280
She also needs you.

109
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,680
Take care of your family,
especially Soo-an.

110
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,900
<i>Come on Soo-an, cheer up!</i>

111
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,900
<i>It's okay, continue singing...</i>

112
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,900
<i>Please give a round of applause
to Soo-an!</i>

113
00:11:06,824 --> 00:11:07,824
<i>Okay.</i>

114
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,300
<i>Yes...ma..</i>

115
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,880
<i>Okay.</i>

116
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,840
No.

117
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,420
I'm with dad.

118
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,600
Yeah, see you there...

119
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,600
Hey Soo-an,
isn't your song finished yet?

120
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,100
How did you know? You weren't there.

121
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,600
Dad always know what you've been doing.

122
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,600
You got nervous right? Am I right?

123
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,260
Yes...

124
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,960
Okay.

125
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,880
You know you have to finish that song.

126
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,140
When you start something.
You should finish it no matter what.

127
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,700
Always remember that.

128
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,980
Ahh... that was close.

129
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,680
What's going on?

130
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,240
It's like raining ashes.

131
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,160
It looks like a big fire.

132
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,700
Hopefully there were no casualties.

133
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:16,260
<i>All departing passengers, kindly board the train
now as this train is now ready to depart for Busan.</i>

134
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,700
Excuse me, where is the south station?

135
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,440
Ah, South station,
you need to go that way..

136
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,360
Thank you.

137
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,800
Hold on, hold on... Your scarf...

138
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,940
Please rest during this trip.

139
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,240
Good.

140
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,900
Wow, Jin-Hee is here.

141
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,640
What do you mean,
I'm coming with you guys.

142
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,240
I'm your cheerleader.

143
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500
How are you guys doing?

144
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,660
Good.

145
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,480
Finally, something fresh for the eyes!

146
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,040
Finally!

147
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,960
Hey, it's rude to take something
that's not yours.

148
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,780
You really hate to share.

149
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,140
Hey, maybe if we were lovers
you're gonna share...

150
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,380
I might even share my bed with you...

151
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,460
Wow, very tempting!

152
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,080
Share with her! Share with her!
Share with her! Share with her!

153
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,260
You want some?

154
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,220
Oh my God!

155
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,080
Don't eat too much eggs...
You'll be passing gas later...

156
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,080
Here take it.

157
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,100
- Eat...
- No thanks.

158
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,180
- <i>Sunbaenim, are you on the train?</i>
- Yes, we're on the train.

159
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,400
<i>Stop thinking about work...
We'll take care of it.</i>

160
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,840
Okay.

161
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,340
We will discuss it again
after this holiday.

162
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,640
He manages the company well.

163
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,020
- See you later.
- <i>Good.</i>

164
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:37,340
- This is not happening...
- This is not happening...

165
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,520
Please don't let this happen!

166
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,300
- Choi Gyo..
- Yes.

167
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,220
- Can you please check lavatory?
- Okay.

168
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,680
- I'd been waiting to go to the lavatory.
- It's occupied.

169
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,220
Ask what's happening in there.

170
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,520
I'm afraid something happened to him.

171
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,700
Yes, he's been there a long time.

172
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,360
Well, I will check...
Please wait a moment...

173
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,820
Sir?

174
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,500
Sir?

175
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,040
Sir?

176
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,620
Sir?

177
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,880
Sir?

178
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,720
Do you have a ticket?

179
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,220
Sir, do you have a ticket?

180
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,500
If you don't, we need to drop
you off on the next station.

181
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,840
Everyone is dead.

182
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,420
- Everyone is dead.
- What?

183
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,500
Hey little girl!

184
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,500
What are you doing here?

185
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,500
I think there are zombies hiding here.

186
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,500
There are no zombies in
modern times like this.

187
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,800
Sir, you must come with me to the back.

188
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,180
Lavatory?

189
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,520
We'll, you'll need to find another place
because my pregnant wife is there.

190
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,820
Go through there... go.

191
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,940
It will really take a while.

192
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,420
Baby? How are you doing in there?

193
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,500
Ahhh... sorry, go ahead.
Take your time... take your time.

194
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,880
Please go ahead.

195
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,480
Go there, go there.

196
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,880
She's gone, she's gone.
Relax... relax...

197
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,440
Miss? Are you okay?

198
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,480
Miss? Oh what to do?

199
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,680
There's an emergency at car 11!

- <i>Hello?</i>

207

<i>But I can't seem to control her seizure!</i>

<i>Sir, what should we do?</i>

209

These people are crazy!

213
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,060
They should be shot and killed.

214
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,600
You mustn't say that.

215
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,588
Look, look.

216
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,480

Get the door! The door!

Do you hear me?!

259

Let it go.

What?

261
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,180
I don't think they know how to open it.

262
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,120
They attack because they see us.

You shut the door in our faces, asshole!

<i>Yes, go ahead.</i>

Do you even know
what's going on back here?

284

Why aren't you stopping in Cheonan?

I'm really sorry,

292
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,460

<i>Riots led to shutting

00:33:46,096 --> 00:33:49,096
<i>Those in front, hurry up!</i>

335
00:33:49,525 --> 00:33:51,025
Soo-an, sit over here.

336
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:53,963
Don't worry, I'll give her a call.

337
00:33:56,005 --> 00:33:57,605
Jong-Gil, come sit down.

338
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,360
You're older, you sit down.

339
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,500
I'm fine, take it.

340
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,020
Baby, let's go over there.

341
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,080
Ma'am, take my seat.

342
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,220
- I'm okay.
- No, please sit.

343
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:17,960
Child.

344
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,960
Would you like one?

345
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,760
Thank you.

346
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,470
What a great kid.

347
00:34:31,329 --> 00:34:33,730
- We both got seats.
- Keep walking.

348
00:34:34,731 --> 00:34:35,731
<i>That bag...</i>

349
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,720
Soo-an, you didn't have to do that.

350
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,860
- Do what?
- Being good.

351
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,120
At a time like this,
only watch out for yourself.

352
00:34:49,413 --> 00:34:50,413
Answer me.

353
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,800
Granny always had knee aches.

354
00:35:00,452 --> 00:35:01,452
Soo-an...

355
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,700
<i>May I have your attention please.</i>

356
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,900
<i>Our train will conclude
service at Daejeon station.</i>

357
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:19,930
<i>Military is deployed there,
and will secure our train.</i>

358
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:24,000
<i>So once we arrive,
please exit the train.</i>

359
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,740
<i>I repeat,</i>

360
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,920
<i>Daejeon station is our last stop.</i>

361
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,400
Which cities can be entered?

362
00:35:31,753 --> 00:35:34,420
Yeosu, Uljin, Busan. What about Daejeon?

363
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,540
Excuse me, I need to use it.

364
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,100
What about Daejeon?

365
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,440
<i>Why not?!</i>

366
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,940
Soo-an, stay put.

367
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,860
Hey, kiddo.

368
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,360
Yes?

369
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,330
Who is he? Your dad?

370
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,040
Yes.

371
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,820
- Real dad?
- Yes.

372
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:57,980
I wanna know.

373
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,500
What does he do?

374
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,750
He's a fund manager.

375
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:05,157
- Fund manager?
- Yes.

376
00:36:06,043 --> 00:36:07,643
He's a bloodsucker, a bloodsucker

377
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,580
He leaches off others.

378
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,460
Don't say that in front of his child.

379
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,940
It's okay.

380
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,340
That's what everyone thinks.

381
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,440
Want some?

382
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,300
It's what Sleepy eats.

383
00:36:29,876 --> 00:36:32,275
This is Sleepy. Say hello

384
00:36:33,753 --> 00:36:35,954
Baby's name is Sleepy?

385
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,550
No, the fetus name.

386
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,120
It's like a nickname,

387
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:44,380
her dad is too lazy to
come up with a name yet.

388
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,460
Touch her belly.

389
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:48,890
Right here.

390
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,340
Go on.

391
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,000
Felt it?

392
00:36:59,806 --> 00:37:01,222
I made that.

393
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,500
- You idiot...
- But it's true. No?

394
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,820
<i>Mr. Seok, you called me at a bad time.</i>

395
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:24,720
Wait, wait!

396
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,780
Let me ask you something.

397
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,840
<i>What?</i>

398
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,180
I'm on KTX to Daejeon.

399
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:35,150
<i>KTX? Right this minute?</i>

400
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,620
Yes, I'm almost there.

401
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:40,853
Is it true the military
is deployed in Daejeon?

402
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,290
<i>Yes, that's correct.</i>

403
00:37:44,634 --> 00:37:47,943
Is that so? It must be safe there.

404
00:37:49,945 --> 00:37:52,206
<i>Well... it's...</i>

405
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,920
Min, it is safe, right?

406
00:37:57,706 --> 00:38:02,802
<i>Once you arrive, you'll be quarantined.</i>

407
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,580
What?

408
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,450
I'm with my daughter.

409
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,120
Can you help me and my daughter, huh?

410
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:16,820
<i>But the thing is...</i>

411
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:20,670
I'll get you a real scoop,
do me a favor.

412
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,820
<i>Don't go to the main square,
come to the East one, okay?</i>

413
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,540
<i>I'll let my men know.</i>

414
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,800
Okay, thank you. Thanks so much.

415
00:38:36,655 --> 00:38:37,655
All dead...

416
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,880
What's going on?

417
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,600
So quiet...

418
00:39:00,786 --> 00:39:01,786
Is it Daejeon?

419
00:39:09,304 --> 00:39:10,304
<i>There's nobody.</i>

420
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,440
Why isn't anyone here?

421
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,240
Out of my way.

422
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,911
What's going on back there?

423
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,580
This is that violent
incident I told you about!

424
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,440
Conductor!

425
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,480
- You're the conductor?
- Yes.

426
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,800
How many can fit in the engine car?

427
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,260
We must uncouple it and go to Busan.

428
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,400
- Uncouple?
- Yes!

429
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,070
- We can't!
- Why not?!

430
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,760
It can't be done here.

431
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,120
Then where's the military?

432
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:47,791
Yeah right.

433
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,240
I only received a report about it...

434
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,860
Where's my business card?

435
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,710
I'm the COO of Stallion Express,

436
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,060
all routes into Daejeon are cut off.

437
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,880
Our buses are all rerouted.

438
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,980
But what for?

439
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,440
The city's been quarantined!

440
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,520
They probably won't let us in.

441
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,220
But Busan is still open,
so let's go there!

442
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,620
Wait, if that's true...

443
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,110
- we must take others.
- Take who?!

444
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,220
Let's check the station first.

445
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:18,720
Hey!

446
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,240
<i>RESTRICTED AREA</i>

447
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,120
Don't mind them.

448
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,640
<i>Come on Soo-an.</i>

449
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,720
Where are we going?

450
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,520
We're going this way.

451
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,450
- Just us?
- Yes, let's go.

452
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,580
What is it?

453
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:32,340
I'm going this way too.

454
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:36,001
Main square is that way,
just follow the others.

455
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,760
I'm gonna come with you.

456
00:42:38,815 --> 00:42:40,416
I heard your phone call.

457
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,910
About pulling you two out.

458
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,130
I know others will be quarantined.

459
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,800
It's not true, Soo-an.

460
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,440
I'll go tell the others.

461
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,270
- Soo-an, you don't have to.
- Of course I do!

462
00:42:56,367 --> 00:42:58,635
Forget them! We're all on our own!

463
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,010
Dad, you only care about yourself.

464
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,950
That's why mommy left.

465
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,360
Soo-an...

466
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,160
Hey!

467
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,240
Here! Over here!

468
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,550
Please help!

469
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,740
Soo-an, stay right here.

470
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,740
Goddamit!

471
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,620
Hold on!

472
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,230
Go back up! Go! Go!

473
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:37,930
Mr. Min...

474
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:39,440
- <i>Mr. Seok!</i>
- I'm in Daejeon.

475
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,200
<i>Is everything okay there?
I can't contact my men!</i>

476
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,260
What?

477
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,580
<i>Hello?!</i>

478
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,020
Help me...

479
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,950
Come on! Hurry!

480
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:43,940
Hurry up! Quick!

481
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:45,820
Take this!

482
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,540
Run! Come on!

483
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,200
Asshole! Come on!

484
00:46:20,846 --> 00:46:21,846
Faster!

485
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,010
Hold them off!

486
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:03,080
- Over here! Run!
- This way! Hurry!

487
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,620
Here! Here!

488
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,340
This way!

489
00:47:10,512 --> 00:47:11,512
Come on!

490
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,840
Hurry!

491
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,200
Why aren't we leaving yet?!

492
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,560
There are still more people!

493
00:47:17,949 --> 00:47:18,949
Hurry up!

494
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,420
Come this way!

495
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,720
Hurry!

496
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,140
Faster! Here!

497
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:39,610
Granny!

498
00:47:40,451 --> 00:47:41,451
Please get up!

499
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,190
No, stop!

500
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:54,800
My sister!

501
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:04,400
Hop on!

502
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,220
Me too!

503
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,710
Let me in!

504
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,480
Please!

505
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,200
How much longer? We have to leave!

506
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,210
No! my friends aren't here yet!

507
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,380
Those onboard must survive!

508
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:56,740
Am I right?

509
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:04,700
Conductor.

510
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,240
Please... depart.

511
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,480
Run! Let's go!

512
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,660
Look, the train!

513
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:48,800
Run faster!

514
00:50:08,295 --> 00:50:09,762
Snap out of it, idiot!

515
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,100
Watch out!

516
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:06,260
Control, 101 could not dock
at Daejeon due to the outbreak.

517
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,440
Advise which station is
available to dock, over.

518
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:14,697
<i>101, due to unstable comm,
it is difficult to advise.</i>

519
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:20,080
Control, is 101 clear to reach Busan?
Over.

520
00:51:22,902 --> 00:51:26,175
<i>101, we'll clear your route to Busan.</i>

521
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,150
<i>Control center, out.</i>

522
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,260
Advise when you make contact with Busan.

523
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,280
101, out.

524
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:51,600
<i>Attention everyone.</i>

525
00:52:52,061 --> 00:52:57,137
<i>For those safety of those on board,
we'll head straight for Busan.</i>

526
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,180
We won't be making any stops.

527
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,960
Conductor, can you hear me?

528
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,660
<i>Go ahead.</i>

529
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,840
Were you able to contact Busan?

530
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:10,010
<i>No, the communication is erratic.</i>

531
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,500
Full speed, no matter what!

532
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,860
Or we won't get in, understand?!

533
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,480
Young-Gook, where are you?!

534
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,060
I thought you were dead!

535
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,560
I'm sorry!

536
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:36,760
No one else made it!

537
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,180
I'm sorry.

538
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:52,720
- Baby?
- <i>Mister!</i>

539
00:53:53,844 --> 00:53:56,232
Why are you answering? Where are you?

540
00:53:56,432 --> 00:53:58,820
We're, we're in the train washroom!

541
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,630
Washroom? Which car?

542
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:04,520
Well... it's...

543
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,860
Car 13!

544
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,740
- Get your ass over here!
- Baby!

545
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,780
Was that my kid?

546
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:13,840
Is she okay?

547
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,940
Washroom in car 13.

548
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,120
Gonna pass through?

549
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:36,740
Let's say you got
through and rescue them,

550
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,380
how will you come back?

551
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,350
In car 15,

552
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,600
people are gathered there.

553
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,580
<i>CAR 9</i>

554
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,640
Only 4 cars away.

555
00:55:16,739 --> 00:55:17,739
I'll lead.

556
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,480
You in the middle,

557
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,120
and you in the back.

558
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,580
Block anyone attacking from the rear.

559
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,880
I heard you're a fund manager.

560
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,460
Then you're an expert,

561
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,620
at leaving useless people behind.

562
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:59,380
Wait till we exit the tunnel.

563
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,510
Let's go.

564
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:27,520
Come on!

565
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,400
Let's go!

566
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:48,960
Move.

567
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:33,980
Out of the way.

568
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,500
They stopped once we entered the tunnel,
right?

569
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,080
Probably because of the darkness.

570
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,060
Yeah, I think so too.

571
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,820
There are even more here.

572
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,250
What do we do now?

573
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,000
There's no way around it.

574
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:57,800
Let's go.

575
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:04,000
Hey, can I borrow your cell?

576
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,180
Get that out of my face.

577
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,640
Yo, douche.

578
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:18,960
Felt good to see your kid thanks to me,
huh?

579
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:21,040
Are you grateful or what?

580
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,800
Why is your ringtone so tacky?

581
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,700
What's wrong with it?

582
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,780
How do I change it?

583
01:02:32,422 --> 01:02:36,398
Am I funny? You little rat.

584
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,360
How tall are you?

585
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:39,760
181cm.

586
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:43,700
10km away, at 300km/h...

587
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,580
What?

588
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:51,040
2 minutes...
upcoming tunnel will give us 2 minutes.

589
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,230
- Can we do it?
- We gotta, we gotta...

590
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:59,660
If we miss this one,
there's another in 3km...

591
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:03,020
I bet you never get to
play with your daughter.

592
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,600
When she gets older,

593
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:11,090
she'll understand why you work so hard.

594
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:16,430
Dads get all the bad rap and no praise,

595
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:19,540
but it's all about sacrifice, right?

596
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:26,200
What's with the look? Did I sound cool?

597
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:36,440
<i>People rescued. Heading over now.</i>

598
01:03:37,951 --> 01:03:39,550
My friend's coming here!

599
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,180
What did you say?

600
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:45,060
My friend from another
car is coming over.

601
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:47,580
- Who's coming?
- My friend!

602
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:51,380
He was in car 9,
and he rescued some people.

603
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:52,660
Rescued?

604
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:59,090
From there to here,
passing through those monsters?

605
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,480
Without any injuries?

606
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,700
You sure they're not infected?

607
01:04:06,070 --> 01:04:08,680
Are you damn sure?!

608
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:12,000
What do you mean?

609
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:14,770
Look, look at them.

610
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,880
At a moment like this,

611
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,830
no one knows what
happened to their families.

612
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:27,370
We don't even know if
your damn friends are infected!

613
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:30,490
But allow them in here?! Huh?!

614
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:36,680
I don't believe this.

615
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,380
Sir,

616
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:52,100
please say something.

617
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,720
They'll be here soon.

618
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,360
Sir!

619
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,720
Get over here.

620
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:57,720
One!

621
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:01,160
Two!

622
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:08,760
Run!

623
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:23,460
Jin-Hee! Jin-Hee!

624
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:28,300
Hurry the hell up!

625
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,300
Open up!

626
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:42,860
Hey! Open this door!

627
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:45,240
Jin-hee!

628
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,380
Open this door!

629
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:05,950
- Open up!
- Jin-Hee! Jin-Hee!

630
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:17,970
Open it now!

631
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,100
It won't budge!

632
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:21,520
I can't open it!

633
01:10:21,649 --> 01:10:22,649
Smash it!

634
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:24,480
Stand back!

635
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:32,480
Hurry up!

636
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,360
Dammit!

637
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:04,220
You stupid idiots!

638
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:18,890
Come on!

639
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:31,540
In-Gil!

640
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,100
Young-Gook!

641
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:42,900
Stand back!

642
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:43,800
Young-Gook!

643
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:19,740
Stay away!

644
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:30,680
Stay back, baby. Please go!

645
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:38,640
Buddy, hey!

646
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:42,160
Take her and leave.

647
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,820
You have to go!

648
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:47,920
I said go, douche!

649
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,840
I'm getting tired, please go.

650
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:58,640
- Please take...
- ...care of her. I will.

651
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:03,880
I'll hold them off, just go!

652
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:16,120
I'm... I'm sorry.

653
01:13:26,993 --> 01:13:28,993
We have to go, let's go!

654
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:32,080
Yoon Su-yun!

655
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,420
Our baby's name!

656
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:38,720
Got it?

657
01:15:38,939 --> 01:15:40,207
Why did you do it?!

658
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:43,980
You bastard!

659
01:15:45,948 --> 01:15:47,416
We could've save them!

660
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:50,960
Why?!

661
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:53,980
He's infected!

662
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:57,280
He's one of them!

663
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:59,090
This guy's infected!

664
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,520
His eyes! Look at his eyes!

665
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:03,940
He'll become one of them!

666
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:05,790
Do you all want to die?!

667
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,520
We must throw them out!

668
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:21,270
Those of you who just arrived,

669
01:16:22,292 --> 01:16:24,625
I don't think you can stay with us.

670
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,480
Please move to the vestibule.

671
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:44,580
Just go!

672
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:50,700
Get out!

673
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:58,720
Get out now!

674
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:01,540
Hurry up!

675
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:03,640
Move!

676
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:07,480
Go!

677
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,420
Leave us!

678
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,000
Get the hell out!

679
01:17:13,698 --> 01:17:14,698
Out now!

680
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:17,680
Hurry!

681
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,200
It'll be safer for you to stay here.

682
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:27,210
No, I don't want to stay.

683
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:29,961
I'm coming with you.

684
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:30,700
But...

685
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:32,530
Get the hell out!

686
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,920
What are you waiting for!

687
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:36,900
Okay, let's go.

688
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:42,000
Get out! Rest of you!

689
01:17:42,676 --> 01:17:43,676
Get out!

690
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:46,020
Get out of here!

691
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:04,940
Let's go.

692
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,910
Tie it faster!

693
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,100
More ties! Neckties!

694
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:49,020
Shut up! I'm working on it!

695
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:05,680
Yun In-Gil

696
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:07,870
Great name.

697
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:13,320
Always helping others
instead of yourself.

698
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,520
Why did you live like that?

699
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:23,480
What was the point?

700
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:26,180
So stupid...

701
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:34,910
Shut up! Be quiet!

702
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:37,460
Stay in your seat!

703
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,940
What a load of shit.

704
01:19:45,770 --> 01:19:48,000
Finish up and do the other side too.

705
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:02,880
Thank you for everyting.

706
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:05,520
That woman...

707
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:06,960
Stop her!

708
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:03,700
Control, this is Busan-bound 101!

709
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,740
Requesting current situation in Busan,
over.

710
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:08,370
Control?!

711
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:09,980
Control!

712
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,460
It's your birthday...

713
01:22:43,157 --> 01:22:44,157
Don't worry.

714
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,920
I'll take you to mom no matter what.

715
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,000
Aren't you scared?

716
01:22:58,940 --> 01:22:59,860
Of course I am.

717
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,150
I'm scared too.

718
01:23:08,310 --> 01:23:10,160
I was so scared.

719
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:13,840
I thought I'd never see you again.

720
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:21,020
I practiced that song just for you.

721
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,340
That's why I couldn't sing.

722
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:31,560
Because I didn't see you.

723
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,360
Will you stay with me?

724
01:23:56,580 --> 01:23:58,520

<i>We're only doing our jobs, right?</i>

739
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,980
<i>Is this my fault, huh?</i>

740
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:20,800
It's...

741
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,120
It's not your fault.

742
01:25:27,192 --> 01:25:28,192

<i>Due to a blockage on our track,</i>

747
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:29,180
<i>We should either wait

748
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:34,060
<i>or we'll have to reach

Will there be a rescue?

756
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:06,700
I heard that Busan is safe.

757
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:10,620
We have to move now.

758
01:30:56,140 --> 01:30:56,960

01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:00,950
Yeah.

I see something.

Two subjects are
approaching at our location.

836
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:48,120
Looks like a woman and a child.

<i>Are you able to verify the subjects?

I can't see them clearly.

840

Cant see the subjects clearly.

Unable to verify.

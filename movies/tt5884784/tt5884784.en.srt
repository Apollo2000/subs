1
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,799
- Ms. Daigle?
- Oh.

2
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,009
- Mr. Johnson.
- How's that brother of yours?

3
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,594
Good. Getting better.

4
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:00,013
- I dropped off rent this morning.
- Yeah.

5
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,059
I stopped by to see if you'll be home
tomorrow so we can change out your locks.

6
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,646
- Why?
- A master key ring went missing.

7
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:09,690
Well, can you change them now?

8
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,234
No, no. No. We've gotta change
the locks out on the whole floor.

9
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:13,860
- Oh.
- Yeah.

10
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,406
Nothing for you to worry about.
We'll surely keep an eye on you.

11
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,494
Yeah, I was wondering too if, uh,

12
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,621
you'd given any thought to my proposal.

13
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,665
Yes. Yeah, I did.

14
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,419
Um, thank you very much,
but I cannot switch apartments right now.

15
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,670
Be less expensive for you.

16
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,463
Yeah, I know. I appreciate it a lot.

17
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,424
If anything changes, I'll let you know.

18
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:36,925
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye, Mr. Johnson.

19
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,176
- Thank you, thank you.
- Okay.

20
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,311
Ann, I'm home.

21
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,446
Ann?

22
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:22,220
Hey, Brad.

23
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,728
Brad?

24
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,319
Hey. There he is.

25
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,072
Hi. How was your day'?

26
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,244
Mine was okay.
I think one of my students was sick.

27
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,080
Threw up on my shoes, that was super fun.

28
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,124
- No.
- No?

29
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,417
- It's your favorite.
- Uh-uh.

30
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,462
All right.

31
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,173
I'm gonna leave this right here.

32
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,257
Mm.

33
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,260
Maybe a little later.

34
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,723
I have a mountain of papers
to grade.

35
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,904
<i>♪ Beautiful dreamer ♪</i>

36
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,992
<i>♪ Wake unto me ♪</i>

37
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,244
See you later then.

38
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,247
<i>♪ Starlight and dewdrops ♪</i>

39
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,582
<i>♪ Waiting for thee ♪</i>

40
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,797
<i>♪ Sounds of the rude world ♪</i>

41
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,759
<i>♪ Heard in the day ♪</i>

42
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,972
<i>♪ Lulled by the moonlight ♪</i>

43
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,684
<i>♪ Have all passed away ♪</i>

44
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,939
<i>♪ Oh, beautiful dreamer ♪</i>

45
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,785
Brad?

46
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,631
What's wrong? Sweetie?

47
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,678
Wait, let me turn the music back on.

48
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,680
What the hell happened to this thing?

49
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,856
Here. There we go.

50
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,358
See? It's all right.

51
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:53,872
Ow!

52
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,711
Mm.

53
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,458
Brad?

54
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,797
Brad, what's going on? Hey.

55
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,388
Brad, where did you get these?

56
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,349
Brad, where did you get these?

57
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,062
- Brad, give me the keys.

58
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,023
Brad, give them to me, please.

59
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,816
Please, don't--

60
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,735
- Ah.
- Get out!

61
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,820
- Get out!

62
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:50,989
Get out!

63
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,159
Get out! Get out!

64
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,953
Get out! Get out!

65
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:29,944
Hello?

66
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,406
Hello?

67
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,201
I'm calling the police.

68
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,463
No!

69
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,757
No, please! No!

70
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,093
No! No!

71
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,041
No. No!

72
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,459
Help! Help me!

73
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,461
Help!

74
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:11,796
Help me!

75
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,591
Help me!

76
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,255
No!

77
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,799
No!

78
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,293
Hi. Uh, Phil Lodge here
to see Mr. Johnson.

79
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,627
- I see you were here last week.
- Yes, sir.

80
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,379
- Yeah, right over there.
- Thank you.

81
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,340
- Daddy?
- Yeah.

82
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:03,885
- Why can't I come in?
- I'm just gonna be a second.

83
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,471
So you stay down here
with your sister, okay?

84
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,515
Hey, Violet, I want you to keep
an eye on Rose for me, okay?

85
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:14,979
Right this way.

86
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:19,317
Mr. Johnson, this is Mr. Lodge.

87
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,319
- Coffee?

88
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,321
- No, thank you.
- All right.

89
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,700
So, Sylvi didn't tell me.
How'd you hear about the position?

90
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:31,788
Uh, one of my daughters.
Her old teacher lives here.

91
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,456
She told me about an apartment.

92
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,793
I came to look at the place, Sylvi told me
there might be a job available.

93
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,170
Six years with the Newburgh Police.

94
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,964
And Why'd you leave?

95
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,342
Uh, my wife passed away.

96
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,221
Oh, sorry.

97
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,848
Loved being a cop, but, uh...

98
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,227
couldn't risk having my daughters grow up
without both of their parents,

99
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,479
so here we are.

100
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:58,773
Let's take a look.

101
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,529
Ah, Bernard Shaw.

102
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:08,866
Nice to see someone your age
enjoying the classics.

103
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,400
The building was originally
the headquarters

104
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,193
for Pete Moore Savings and Loan

105
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,987
until it went under in the Depression.

106
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,239
Depression put them under in '33.

107
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,909
There's more than one sub-basement
that made up the old vault area.

108
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,661
Place is a maze.

109
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,746
I don't even go down there.

110
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:57,915
It's off-limits to tenants, of course.

111
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,626
Owners and high-end renters
have access to the gym

112
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,879
the conference room, the lounges.

113
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,213
Get a good deal.

114
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,841
Well, we like to keep
our more affluent residents happy.

115
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,886
You know, they pay very
expensive maintenance fees.

116
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,054
Some pay for parking in our garage.

117
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,559
It's more than-- more than
some of the tenants' rent.

118
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,020
This way, now.

119
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,120
Hey.

120
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,206
Give me one of those.

121
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,669
Thanks.

122
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,985
Who are you?

123
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,696
I'm Rose.

124
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,742
You don't belong here, Rose.

125
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,544
Well, not that it's part of your job,

126
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:10,089
but it'd be good to have someone
on staff with your experience.

127
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,842
- Are there problems?
- No, no. Heavens, no.

128
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,804
With the low-income tenants,

129
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,764
it's always good to have
an extra pair of eyes.

130
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,474
I'm not familiar with furnaces.

131
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,685
- I'm pretty handy.
- You know what? That's good.

132
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,938
That's one of the oldest working furnaces
in all of New York City right there.

133
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,274
That's-- Look at that.

134
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,485
Pennsylvania Boiler Works, 1890.

135
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:39,035
Yeah, don't mind
those photos over there.

136
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,163
Those belong to Walter.

137
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,999
Now, Walter's our most senior super.

138
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,293
Yeah, best to keep an eye on him.

139
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,212
He's into some Ukrainian
psycho voodoo shit, but...

140
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,090
probably nothing to get excited about.

141
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,469
Well, this is-- There you go.

142
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,638
Usual staff quarters are all taken.

143
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,766
But, uh, well, this should do for now.

144
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,061
Have to call Conrad about that.

145
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,646
It's not much, I know.

146
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,105
No, it's, uh--

147
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,316
Uh, as long as it's only temporary.

148
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:11,942
Thank you for this.

149
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,654
Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.m.
Bright and early.

150
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,072
- 7:00, it is.
- Don't be late.

151
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,575
How many times do I have to tell you?

152
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,535
I'll get these myself.

153
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:25,331
I don't want you in my apartment alone.

154
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,624
I understand.

155
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,422
Excuse me. Uh, my daughters,
one 14, one seven, have you seen them?

156
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,507
Do you mind?

157
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,802
Excuse me, I didn't see a seven-year-old,

158
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,680
but I saw a teenage girl
a few minutes ago by that door.

159
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,057
I appreciate it. Thank you.

160
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,144
I doubt I'll still even be here
when school starts, so...

161
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,814
I don't even wanna think about
where I'm gonna go.

162
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,775
I told you to watch your sister.

163
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:54,985
Bye.

164
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,615
Bye.

165
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,997
- Give me the rest of the cigarettes.
- He only gave me one.

166
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,457
He only gave you one?

167
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,418
Daddy?

168
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,714
Hey, there you are, baby.

169
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,382
I was looking for you.

170
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,010
Where do I get a ball like that, Daddy?

171
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,639
- Ball like what?
- The one the boy had.

172
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,516
Everything all right?

173
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:27,727
It's great.

174
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,105
- I'm Beverly.
- That's Violet.

175
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,150
She's my oldest.
Thank you very much, by the way.

176
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,486
- Are you taking a place here?
- Actually, I got a job here as the super.

177
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,364
So, next time you see me,
I'll be in uniform.

178
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,159
- Phil Lodge.
- Well, welcome aboard, Phil.

179
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,910
Thank you very much.

180
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,083
Can we leave now?

181
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,919
- Why?
- I don't like it here.

182
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,046
If Mommy were here,
she'd want to leave too.

183
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,341
You're gonna like it here.

184
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,807
- Stop that.

185
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,742
Who's in here?

186
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,371
Don't think I won't use this.

187
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,631
Damn it, Murphy.

188
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,050
Boy, leave it alone.

189
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,886
That's not for you.

190
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:47,927
You all right, baby?

191
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:55,100
What's wrong, baby?

192
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:16,413
I'm sorry. I thought the room was empty.

193
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:18,582
Clearly it's not.

194
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,837
I'm Phil Lodge. Hi.

195
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,384
I just started working here.
I live here, so--

196
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,719
Suppose they should've told you.

197
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,684
Did you need anything else?

198
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:12,845
Hey.

199
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,639
What do you think you're doing, man?

200
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:20,310
No, I'm just fucking around, dude.
You can take that.

201
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:23,480
You can take anything you want.
38-C moved out.

202
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:24,898
She left all that.

203
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:26,692
I'm Julio.

204
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:28,652
Phil Lodge.

205
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,112
Hey, Phil, good to meet you.

206
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,531
Does this happen a lot?
It's a lot of stuff.

207
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,701
Well, you know, some people donate stuff
and some people, they just leave it.

208
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,036
I took a dresser.

209
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,788
So, is this your first gig as a super?

210
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,374
Yeah, I used to be a cop, actually.

211
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,001
Well, this is gonna be
a lot less exciting.

212
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,252
I don't mind that.

213
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,297
Get to spend a lot more time
with my kids anyway.

214
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,381
Vondell.

215
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,133
Vondell!

216
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,760
Vondell, stop with the ball.

217
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:55,095
Stop with the ball.
You're scuffing up the wall.

218
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,722
How many times do I gotta tell you this?

219
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,433
Fucking kid.

220
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,353
Anyways, family
is the most important thing.

221
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,857
- Ah, it's pretty empty, huh?
- Yeah, don't worry about that.

222
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,859
Come Monday morning, it's gonna
be like Macy's out there.

223
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,280
What's your name?

224
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,992
- That's Violet.
- Hey, Violet.

225
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,369
I'm Julio.

226
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,290
Right, she's just quiet.

227
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,293
See you later, sweetie.

228
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,023
Rose?

229
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,402
Rose? Rose?

230
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,655
Rose! Rose!

231
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:07,895
Rose?

232
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:11,773
Hey!

233
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,359
Hey.

234
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,740
What are you doing, baby?

235
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,743
Just looking at the flames.

236
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,384
Just come upstairs with me.

237
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,844
Please.

238
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,723
How's the little one?

239
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,520
Rose seemed lost.

240
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,775
How do you know
my daughter's name, Walter?

241
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,401
She told me.

242
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,700
You spoke to my daughter?

243
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,536
Just enough, Phil.

244
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,624
Just head up to 70-B, will ya?

245
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,043
There's a faulty window.
It's off the track up there.

246
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,586
It's gonna break somebody's neck.

247
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,381
We'll have a damn claim on our hand.
Cal, listen up.

248
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,467
I'm getting complaints
about Mrs. Grey's dog yapping.

249
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,095
She knows she can't leave that animal
alone up in there. Go check it out.

250
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,847
Yeah, but she said she'll have you fire me
if I'm up there when she's not home.

251
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:29,309
She lived in this building 50 years,
payin' $100 rent.

252
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:30,894
I don't give a rat's ass
what Mrs. Grey wants.

253
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,479
- Go check it out.
- Yes, sir.

254
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,897
Cal.

255
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,108
I can go up with you if you like.

256
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,033
Hello?

257
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,577
Mrs. Grey?

258
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,500
Mrs. Grey?

259
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:59,923
- Did she say she was going away?
- If she did, I tuned her out.

260
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,842
Come here, boy. Get over here. Come here.

261
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:07,931
Mrs. Grey?

262
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,104
All right, put it down
and let's get out here.

263
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,398
Oh, but--

264
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,609
We can't leave him.
We should take the dog, right?

265
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,361
This is your idea, not mine.

266
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:22,946
All right.

267
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,371
- What the hell?
- Daddy said I can have the dog.

268
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:33,498
What's that thing?

269
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,542
I think someone's
little princess outgrew it.

270
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,252
It's just perfect for mine.

271
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,339
Okay, there you go, sweetie.

272
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,720
- I wish Mommy could see it.
- And I'm still on the floor?

273
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,805
It's just for now.
I'm still on the floor too.

274
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,434
- I'm so fucking sick of this.
- Hey, language.

275
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,062
Everything's for Rose!
Every goddamn thing we do!

276
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,480
Violet, wait.

277
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,997
Mom, door.

278
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,126
Little busy over here, Vondell.

279
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:02,212
Get your ass up and get it. Come on.

280
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,455
Violet, right?

281
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,832
Yeah.

282
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,506
You know, I have a younger sister.

283
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,759
She was always getting in the way,
messing up my life.

284
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:52,762
There are so many times I really
thought I was gonna kill her.

285
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,473
You know?

286
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,976
What are you doing here?

287
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,236
That was weird.

288
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,263
Julio.

289
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,891
Hey, you got a flat-head screwdriver?

290
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,143
Must've left it inside.

291
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,022
Beverly.

292
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,903
- You're so athletic.

293
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:36,157
My wife works for Beverly
at the Folk Art Museum.

294
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,201
- Hi.
- Hi.

295
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,661
Sofia reach you?

296
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,122
Friday, 8:00 p.m. at the terrace.

297
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,040
- Turning fuckin' 50, bro.

298
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:46,376
My wife's throwing me
a birthday party to depress me.

299
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,920
You're coming, by the way.

300
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:00,473
He said someone was at the door.

301
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,312
- Freddy, what happened?
- Vondell Evans is missing.

302
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:08,648
I mean, he pulls this crap all the time,
but usually it's just for an hour or two.

303
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:11,735
Someone has my son!

304
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:15,071
Von!

305
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,868
Julio, what do you know about Walter?

306
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,622
He's got those pictures by the furnace
that freak me out every time I see them.

307
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:24,873
I'm gonna see you later.

308
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,584
If you ask me, the place is haunted.

309
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,545
Something down, it's gone.
Look again, it's back.

310
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,672
- Hello.

311
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:33,923
Violet?

312
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,719
Violet?

313
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,055
What's going on?

314
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:45,268
The police are looking for, uh, Vondell,
the kid you were smoking with, uh...

315
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,938
They don't know what happened.
He probably just ran away.

316
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,899
I just got a little worried.

317
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,736
We have to look out for each other, right?

318
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,948
Violet, I'm so sorry.

319
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,117
I'm sorry.

320
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,310
Don't worry, Rose.

321
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,312
Your father is still there.

322
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,735
What's that?

323
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,947
Now, this, this is Nisitas.

324
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,366
He was tormented.

325
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:28,913
So tormented, he moved to a cave
and lived as a hermit.

326
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:31,458
But then Nisitas learned to do something.

327
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:37,046
Something so magic
that no one has ever done before.

328
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,799
- What?
- He whispers.

329
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:41,551
Can you hear him?

330
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:49,309
You, you know what happened
to this boy, Vondell.

331
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:53,021
He is missing. Show me where he is.

332
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,564
Show me.

333
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,317
Show me where he is!

334
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,652
Hey. Hey!

335
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,197
What are you doing?

336
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,708
I don't want you around my children.
Never again.

337
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,003
Bye-bye, Rose.

338
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:19,088
Baby, come on.

339
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,301
Bye-bye.

340
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,197
Violet?

341
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:48,910
Sweetie.

342
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:52,789
Sweetie.

343
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,974
Daddy?

344
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,767
I just saw Mommy.

345
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:18,815
Mommy and I were in the garden,
and she let me use the hose,

346
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,734
and everything that I watered
turned into flowers.

347
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:23,361
They were everywhere.

348
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,656
Go back to bed, baby.

349
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,905
- What are you doing, Lodge?
- I'm just mopping, sir.

350
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:08,114
Just do the halls.

351
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,949
You don't need to go in there.
It's not part of your job.

352
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,242
Yes, sir. I apologize.

353
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,399
All right.

354
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:46,361
Violet.

355
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,739
Give it a chance, okay?
You might have a good time.

356
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:53,826
What do you think?

357
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,245
With or with no chocolate frosting?

358
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:58,456
- There's the man.
- Hey.

359
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:01,292
- I'm Sofia, Julio's wife.
- Phil. Nice to meet you.

360
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,460
- Nice meeting you.
- Happy birthday, sir.

361
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,253
- Oh, thanks, man.
- Oh, all right.

362
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:05,880
- Thank you so much.
- My kids.

363
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,507
- Hector and Diego.
- Hey, Hector.

364
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:11,803
Julio said you have two.

365
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,013
Violet right here, this is my oldest.

366
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,683
Little sister Rose is...

367
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,644
run off to find some fun somewhere,
I guess.

368
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,229
Hey, you want something to eat?

369
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,482
Uh, yeah. Violet, you hungry?

370
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,876
Who is that?

371
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:32,341
So, Violet, what do you think of Beverly?

372
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,305
I wanted to stay at the party.

373
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,140
Mommy would've let me stay.

374
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,647
- Violet?
- What do you care?

375
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:50,568
Why did we have to leave?
Other people got to stay.

376
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:52,862
I know.

377
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,998
- Daddy?
- Yeah.

378
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,626
- Smells bad.
- What does, sweetie?

379
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,091
Rose. Rose.

380
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,634
- What's going on?
- What's wrong?

381
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,552
I don't like it, Daddy.

382
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,431
It's all wet.

383
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:30,983
Dad.

384
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,443
I'll be right back.

385
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:58,261
Hey. Did they find Vondell?

386
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,388
Johnson doesn't like things on the walls.

387
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:09,564
I know you were in my apartment, Walter.

388
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,987
I'm gonna have to kill you, all right?

389
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,990
Uh... Uh...

390
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:25,580
Phil. Hey, Phil. What's going on, guys?

391
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,376
Hey, are you okay?

392
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,425
Wouldn't worry too much about Walter.

393
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:41,846
He told me that after his wife died
every night at dinnertime

394
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,891
he'd see her sitting
across the table from him.

395
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,188
I thought it was kind of romantic.

396
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:51,647
Yeah.

397
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:55,818
You have a strange sense of romance.

398
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:58,029
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

399
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,865
Well, after my college boyfriend
proposed to me,

400
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,159
- I couldn't stop laughing.
- You laughed at him?

401
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,203
Then he called me a mental patient,
and that was that.

402
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,830
Don't worry, it's not like I'm gonna...

403
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:10,166
come after you with a knife or anything.

404
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:32,146
Hey, um, I should get going.

405
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,317
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

406
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,612
Well... um...

407
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,157
just... put your dead bolt on.

408
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,575
Okay.

409
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:22,947
Phil?

410
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:19,128
Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of
the color of these walls though.

411
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,255
I love this building.
It has such a good vibe.

412
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:22,965
Well, the building
was originally the headquarters

413
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:24,508
of Pete Moore Savings and Loan

414
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:27,595
till it went under in
the Depression in 1933.

415
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:28,929
Look at this.

416
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:31,015
That's her.

417
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,309
- That's the teacher.
- I know her.

418
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,436
That's Violet's favorite teacher.

419
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,730
She was the one that told me
how much she loved this place.

420
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,441
- Why would she move out?
- Family emergency.

421
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,110
People split all the time.

422
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,910
That's blood, man.

423
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,249
Mr. Johnson?

424
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,085
Can I show you something?

425
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,546
Look at this. That's blood.

426
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,773
You do some maintenance too, huh?

427
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,733
So you like it?

428
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:24,735
- Yeah, we'll take it.
- Well, that's good.

429
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,780
We have three terraces,
a roof garden, and a gym,

430
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,365
conference room, lounge.

431
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,618
I have something
I think I should show you.

432
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:54,932
Hello?

433
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,311
Excuse me. The elevator's stuck.

434
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,827
It makes perfect sense that it's Johnson.

435
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,829
We don't know that yet.

436
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:19,707
But he was acting weird around this room.

437
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:25,129
You get the old rent-control tenants out,
prices skyrocket.

438
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:32,761
There's nothing in here, bro.

439
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,475
What?

440
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:57,578
I don't know if he's a murderer,
but... he's definitely a pervert.

441
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:07,796
<i>Hello. The elevator isn't moving.
Excuse me. Hello!</i>

442
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:40,579
Hello?

443
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:46,377
Shit!

444
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,534
Aah! Shit.

445
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:58,741
You're so stubborn. You would not listen.

446
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,492
You are gonna re--

447
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:02,119
Get away from me! Get away!

448
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,454
No!

449
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,481
No! Get off! No!

450
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:31,899
Hey, what's wrong?

451
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,776
Hey, what's wrong?

452
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,861
- This is your fault!
- What's my fault?

453
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,571
This would've never happened
if Mom was here!

454
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:39,448
Maybe I wouldn't have creepy,
fucking old men

455
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:40,908
chasing me around basements.

456
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:43,327
What's going on?

457
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:49,249
- I'm taking this guy down right now!

458
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:00,302
What are you doin', man?
What are you doin'?

459
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:02,680
Dude, she needs that to get around.

460
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:03,806
Exactly.

461
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,058
She's not away.

462
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:08,310
Something happened to her.
The same thing that happened to Vondell.

463
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:09,645
The same thing that's gonna
happen to my kids

464
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,689
unless I do something about this.

465
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,566
What if it was your kids
he was threatening?

466
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,568
Dude, planting evidence?

467
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:17,820
Make an anonymous call.

468
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,822
They'll talk to him,
they'll get a warrant.

469
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:21,657
I promise you,

470
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,159
they'll find plenty of real evidence
on their own.

471
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:26,054
He's coming, he's coming, he's coming.

472
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,184
Hey, Walter.

473
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,439
Sofia's looking for you.
There's a leak in 12-B.

474
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:36,356
So fix it.

475
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,484
It's no secret they think
I'm a shitty plumber.

476
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:41,820
Johnson's office is right below. Please.
We don't want that stuff leaking through.

477
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:43,989
- I don't have my tools--
- Can you just get 'em, Walter?

478
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,575
And do me a solid, please?

479
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,495
No.

480
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,297
I owe you, Walter.

481
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:10,766
Don't fuckin' do that!

482
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,185
Now fuckin' what?

483
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,147
We make an anonymous call.

484
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:46,844
When was the last time you saw
the tenant in 15-H, Mrs. Grey?

485
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:49,888
Oh, I got hundreds of tenants, you know.

486
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:53,308
She could be in the park,
or she's shopping, she's riding a bike.

487
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:54,560
Who knows?

488
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:55,727
Listen.

489
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:57,020
Do me a favor.

490
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:58,981
If you hear something, give me a call.

491
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:10,492
When I was 12, my mother had an affair.

492
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:13,704
And... my dad had all these connections,

493
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:16,331
so he managed to get custody
and basically...

494
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,376
cut her out of our lives.

495
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,672
Sorry to hear that.

496
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,382
I was a little younger than Violet,

497
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:28,260
so I know what it's like
to act out at her age.

498
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,555
Ah, Violet.

499
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:36,101
I'm the bad guy right now.
She blames me for everything.

500
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:38,437
Which I don't really
fault her for, 'cause...

501
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:41,106
I blame myself.

502
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,357
For what?

503
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:49,531
There was a fire.

504
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:55,370
And my wife was stuck upstairs.

505
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,333
The floor collapsed.
I was able to get Rose and myself out.

506
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,002
But I wasn't able to reach her.

507
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:05,881
What about Violet?

508
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:09,593
Uh, she was in the yard.
Thank God for that.

509
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:14,681
So Violet, when her mom died...

510
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,268
she wanted everything else dead too.

511
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:22,731
I'm sorry.

512
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:34,910
You're a good dad.

513
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:25,312
Hey. Why did they let him go?

514
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,897
He didn't know how
the old lady's cane handle

515
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,482
ended up in the dresser.

516
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:33,403
They're not even convinced
the old lady is missing.

517
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:36,907
They also didn't find anything else
when they searched his place, Phil.

518
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:14,361
You can't protect them.

519
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,279
I'm coming for them.

520
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:20,408
- Dad?

521
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:23,203
You all right?

522
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,248
Yeah.

523
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,417
What are you doing up?

524
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:33,922
I heard you and thought you were
having a bad dream or something.

525
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,597
Come here.

526
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:50,147
You are a good kid.

527
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:25,432
Are you okay, bro?

528
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:28,018
Yeah.

529
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,353
Haven't been getting much sleep.

530
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:34,900
I guess with Walter back,
I'm just kind of freaking out.

531
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,238
Hey, you seen Phil and Julio?

532
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,702
Hello? Walter?

533
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:59,216
Are you guys looking
at the work screen or what?

534
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:02,886
I've been texting you all morning.
38-C has a problem with the lock.

535
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:05,805
- I got it. I got it.
- Phil's taking it.

536
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:07,933
You want the job, don't you, Phil?

537
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:11,978
- You keep an eye on her.
- Yeah, yeah.

538
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,903
- Maybe I should go help him with the lock.
- You're not going anywhere.

539
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,863
- Oh.

540
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:37,504
<i>I'm watchin' the kids.</i>

541
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:57,482
- Hello?
- Hey.

542
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,445
Uh, the office said that you
had a problem with one of your locks.

543
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:05,073
Yeah, I woke up,
and they were all unlocked.

544
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:07,242
- The dead bolts and everything.
- Oh, my gosh.

545
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:09,035
Can you please just put some clothes on?

546
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,204
I'm sorry to drag you up here.

547
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:13,164
She just stumbled in
really late last night.

548
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:15,166
I did not stumble.
I never stumble.

549
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:16,668
I don't know what you're talking about.

550
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:44,237
Julio? Julio?

551
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,365
Violet? Are you all right?

552
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:49,784
- Where's Julio?
- He left.

553
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,620
Where's Rose, Violet?

554
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,332
- Where's Rose?
- You know where she is.

555
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:18,438
Something reeks.

556
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:25,695
Smells just like Rose's bed.

557
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:28,573
Hey, listen, you go back,
and you lock the door.

558
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:31,034
- Okay? Okay?
- Fine.

559
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:49,260
You're fine, baby.

560
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:24,045
Hey, sweetie. Come here.

561
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:26,923
Puppy, don't go. Puppy.

562
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:53,992
Hello, Phil.

563
01:05:56,619 --> 01:06:00,165
The knowledge has been
passed down for generations.

564
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:03,334
Nisitas was the first.

565
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:07,755
With a great fire,
he summoned the unwanted souls.

566
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:12,760
He forged a chain
and sent back the cursed ones

567
01:06:12,844 --> 01:06:14,679
from where they came.

568
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:16,264
Where is she, Walter?

569
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:19,893
He protected us from the dead.

570
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:24,689
Now it is me who must protect us.

571
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:26,941
Where is she? Where is she?

572
01:06:27,025 --> 01:06:29,277
- Where is she?
- Where is she?

573
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:31,613
Dad?

574
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:33,823
Where is she? Where?

575
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:41,164
Where is she?

576
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:46,711
Where is she? Where is she? Where is she?

577
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,271
Please tell me where she is.

578
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,525
Give her back to me!

579
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:11,361
- Coming.

580
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:13,863
Violet.

581
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:15,323
Can I come in?

582
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:17,825
Yeah.

583
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,533
Daddy?

584
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:04,038
Rose.

585
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:08,084
I was really worried about you.
Where were you, baby?

586
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:09,419
I heard the bad person.

587
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:13,089
So I ran away. He was chasing me.

588
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:15,216
I'm glad you're okay.

589
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,935
Hey, I was just about to call you.

590
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,021
<i>Julio--</i>

591
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,440
Listen, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

592
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:32,108
<i>I fucked up.</i>

593
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:33,985
<i>I fucked up so bad.</i>

594
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:36,946
Hey, man, what's wrong?
What's wrong with you?

595
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:43,369
Mr. Johnson.

596
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:45,705
You're not gonna like this.

597
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:49,042
Let me call you back.

598
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:57,008
I thought he had my baby, and I--

599
01:08:57,508 --> 01:08:59,427
I just wanted him to tell me
where she was.

600
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,054
I just couldn't stop.

601
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:03,264
Okay.

602
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,268
Where is he?

603
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:16,235
He was right here.

604
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:17,987
Yeah?

605
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:21,741
You lost him?

606
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:24,786
Phil, look at me.

607
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:26,204
Phil.

608
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:29,040
What's going on with you, man?

609
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:35,421
Why was this in your apartment?

610
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,262
That's mine.

611
01:09:46,474 --> 01:09:47,558
Who are you?

612
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:49,435
I'm Rose.

613
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:53,106
I don't think I've ever
met you before, Rose.

614
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:57,151
Most people don't see me
until it's their time.

615
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:47,994
He was my friend.

616
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,496
He found out.

617
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:54,000
They'd take you away from us.

618
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:57,837
That's my sister.

619
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:00,965
She's the cute one.

620
01:11:05,303 --> 01:11:07,847
- You know, I think it helps--
- Don't try to be my mom.

621
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:10,975
I'm not your mom, Violet.

622
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:22,361
I want to show you something.

623
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:26,741
This is Rose.

624
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:38,002
Mr. Lodge?

625
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:41,214
Mr. Lodge?

626
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:44,967
Walter was right about you, Mr. Lodge.

627
01:11:45,051 --> 01:11:48,429
When I rehired him,
he suggested you falsified your resume.

628
01:11:49,347 --> 01:11:51,140
Newburgh Police has no record--

629
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:54,393
no record of you.

630
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:58,147
There must be some mistake.

631
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:04,320
Oh, no.

632
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:07,365
No! No!

633
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,200
No!

634
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,038
She's cute.

635
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,083
You know, I've never actually met her.

636
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,918
That was just before the funeral.

637
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:25,550
- And that's Rose?
- No, that's me.

638
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:29,679
You looked a lot like her.

639
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:31,514
That was taken seven years ago.

640
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:10,678
- Daddy.
- No.

641
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,650
- Violet, I don't understand.
- This is where we grew up.

642
01:13:25,192 --> 01:13:26,736
Burned down on our birthday.

643
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,488
You and Rose have the same birthday?

644
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:30,990
Of course we do.

645
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:33,784
We're twins.

646
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:40,917
I'm three minutes older.

647
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:44,670
You and Rose can't be twins.
Phil said she's only seven.

648
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:48,925
No, we were both seven.
We were both seven the day she died.

649
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:51,594
She can't be dead. Phil talks about her.

650
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:53,095
He sees her.

651
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:57,099
He sees her, and that weird
janitor Walter sees her

652
01:13:57,183 --> 01:13:59,060
ever since we moved here, and...

653
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:05,900
You'll see her too.

654
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:09,195
No!

655
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,588
No. Oh, God!

656
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:32,843
Please.

657
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:41,477
Oh, no. Oh, my God. Please. Oh, no.

658
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,728
No!

659
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:02,707
Daddy.

660
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:05,001
Violet's telling.

661
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:12,299
Rose always did whatever she wanted,
and no one ever did anything about it.

662
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:15,928
My favorite teacher, Ms. Daigle.
Did you know her?

663
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:18,889
She used to live here
until Rose got to her.

664
01:15:18,973 --> 01:15:22,059
We were friends. That's all it took.

665
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:25,521
I had a picture of Vondell.
I never got one of Mrs. Grey.

666
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:27,231
I think Rose just wanted her dog.

667
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:31,402
It's been happening like this
ever since she died.

668
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:33,320
I don't think she can be stopped.

669
01:15:35,823 --> 01:15:37,366
I don't understand what--

670
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:38,826
Don't you get it?

671
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:42,121
She's evil.

672
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:47,209
Hey, Phil. Have you seen Julio'?

673
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:49,670
His phone is off,
and I can't seem to find him.

674
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:54,216
You're not covering
for my husband, are you, Phil?

675
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,344
I mean, I know the kind of man...

676
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:09,815
Phil?

677
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:15,404
Yeah, he's up on the--
On the roof fixing a railing.

678
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,035
Give him that when you see him.

679
01:16:31,212 --> 01:16:33,672
Rose set the fire
that burned the house down?

680
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:38,260
It was all because Mom
wanted to punish Rose.

681
01:16:40,471 --> 01:16:41,722
For all she's done.

682
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:43,599
Rose burned down the house.

683
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:46,727
I didn't know my mother was home.
I swear I didn't.

684
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:51,732
Violet told Daddy what I did.

685
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:56,529
So he broke my neck
and threw me out of a window.

686
01:16:57,238 --> 01:16:58,656
How did you get in here?

687
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:01,909
You see her, don't you?

688
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:05,704
- Daddy knows what Violet said.
- We have to get out of here.

689
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,877
Why are we doing this?

690
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:14,130
If you saw Rose, it means
my dad's not far behind.

691
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:15,214
I don't understand.

692
01:17:19,426 --> 01:17:20,427
Shit!

693
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:23,639
- Hello, Beverly.
- Rose?

694
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,435
- Beverly.

695
01:17:28,519 --> 01:17:30,312
I'm sorry.

696
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:44,869
Phil?

697
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:50,374
I'm sorry.

698
01:17:54,962 --> 01:17:57,047
Run! No! No!

699
01:18:09,435 --> 01:18:11,312
- Wait.
- Let's go this way!

700
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:14,773
There's no way out.

701
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:23,949
Daddy!

702
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:46,222
Rose.

703
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:51,310
- What are you--
- No! You can't touch her!

704
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:52,269
- Violet.
- You--

705
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:06,992
- What are you doing?

706
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:07,993
Get off of her!

707
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:10,955
You do not touch her.

708
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:12,873
You can't. He's getting rid of her.

709
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:18,796
Daddy!

710
01:19:23,801 --> 01:19:26,095
- She's just a child. What--
- No, she's not!

711
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:41,860
Violet, help me!

712
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:47,199
Daddy!

713
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:03,424
Daddy, Daddy, help me.

714
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:09,430
You're okay. It's okay.

715
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:13,267
It's okay.

716
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:28,991
Phil.

717
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:31,243
Phil.

718
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:41,045
I'm trying to save you, Phil.

719
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:31,512
No. Phil, you don't have to do this.

720
01:21:31,762 --> 01:21:33,389
Please.

721
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:34,890
Daddy, wait.

722
01:21:39,686 --> 01:21:41,939
You know what I really want?

723
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:52,408
A mommy.

724
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:32,114
- What do I do?
- Just do what she says, and it's okay.

725
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:33,949
Are we done, baby?

726
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:36,285
No, Daddy.

727
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:38,287
We're just getting started.

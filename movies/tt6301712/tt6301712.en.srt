Mark!

3
00:02:28,227 --> 00:02:29,893
Mark?

4
00:02:29,895 --> 00:02:31,230
Can you please turn that down?

5
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:35,168
Can you not hear me?

6
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,299
What are you...

7
00:02:59,991 --> 00:03:01,193
Mark!

8
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:09,431
Mark!

9
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:10,870
- Mark!
- Hey!

10
00:03:14,438 --> 00:03:16,038
I'm sorry, Mark.

11
00:03:23,649 --> 00:03:26,382
Get off me, you fucking cunt!

12
00:03:26,384 --> 00:03:27,485
Shut the fuck up.

13
00:03:40,431 --> 00:03:41,867
Mark!

14
00:03:46,237 --> 00:03:48,240
Get on your knees.
Get on your knees.

15
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:03,553
What did they do?

16
00:04:03,555 --> 00:04:05,324
They stole from me.

17
00:04:06,692 --> 00:04:08,425
What was it?

18
00:04:08,427 --> 00:04:10,493
Heroin.

19
00:04:10,495 --> 00:04:13,462
Your brother helped this piece of
shit rip two bags from one of my crew.

20
00:04:13,464 --> 00:04:14,599
They broke the code.

21
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:18,468
- Get him up.
- No, no, no, no!

22
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,139
No, no, no, no...

23
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:26,142
You either knock him,
or I'll get him to knock you.

24
00:04:26,144 --> 00:04:27,610
I'll fucking do it. I'll do it.

25
00:04:27,612 --> 00:04:29,411
I'll do it. Give me the gun.
I'll fucking do it.

26
00:04:29,413 --> 00:04:31,116
Give me the gun.
I'll fucking do it.

27
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,387
- Skink, man, don't.
- I'm sorry.

28
00:04:35,754 --> 00:04:37,323
Do it.

29
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:42,194
Skink...

30
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:44,463
I'll fucking do it.

31
00:04:50,735 --> 00:04:52,538
You fucking cunt.

32
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:57,440
No, no, no, no, no! No, no!

33
00:05:02,346 --> 00:05:03,512
Right over there.

34
00:05:06,517 --> 00:05:08,019
Come on, hurry up.

35
00:05:10,588 --> 00:05:12,454
There.

36
00:05:12,456 --> 00:05:13,959
Dig it deep. Shoulder height.

37
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,569
Fuck me. What happened to you?

38
00:05:26,204 --> 00:05:28,605
Dad threw boiling
water on my back.

39
00:05:28,607 --> 00:05:30,376
So, I stabbed the cunt
in the throat.

40
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,712
And threw him in the river.

41
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:40,416
Rules are rules.

42
00:05:40,418 --> 00:05:42,221
How's he gonna get to learn?

43
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,525
I will work something out.

44
00:05:53,064 --> 00:05:54,163
I've got a good idea.

45
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:55,264
Why don't you bring your bitch?

46
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:56,601
I'll introduce her
to my bitches.

47
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:02,805
Don't you fucking touch her.

48
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:04,074
Don't you fucking...

49
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:24,293
Get down!

50
00:06:25,697 --> 00:06:28,363
The bitches always
the best fighters, you know.

51
00:06:28,365 --> 00:06:31,637
I mean, these ones, they
prefer to fight than fuck.

52
00:06:32,838 --> 00:06:34,573
I got to strap 'em down
to breed.

53
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,740
It's called a rape stand.

54
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:40,877
But now they're angry.

55
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,711
And every time they're
looking at me, I swear to God,

56
00:06:42,713 --> 00:06:44,716
they're planning some
type of payback.

57
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,151
Your bitch ever look
at you like that?

58
00:06:48,153 --> 00:06:49,553
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

59
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,627
What? Should we let 'em out?

60
00:06:55,392 --> 00:06:56,494
Eh?

61
00:06:58,697 --> 00:07:01,296
They'll rip your fucking
throat out.

62
00:07:09,274 --> 00:07:11,076
You wanna save your brother?

63
00:07:13,245 --> 00:07:15,277
I wanna do business.

64
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,913
You've done well
for yourself, Paddo.

65
00:07:16,915 --> 00:07:18,551
Got a lot of cash
that needs cleaning.

66
00:07:19,884 --> 00:07:22,454
We own a pub,
we own a restaurant.

67
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:24,622
We can wash your cash.

68
00:07:25,423 --> 00:07:26,826
Yeah, I can do that.

69
00:07:27,725 --> 00:07:30,692
I do that, I get 30%.

70
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:32,361
And we wanna sell
to your customers.

71
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:37,669
Oh, she's a merry little
fucking thing, isn't she?

72
00:07:41,673 --> 00:07:43,675
Back the fuck up, pal.

73
00:07:45,343 --> 00:07:46,612
I'll take 30%,

74
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:49,581
and I'll wash your cash. Hmm?

75
00:07:51,182 --> 00:07:53,183
Or I'll kill that simple cunt.

76
00:07:53,185 --> 00:07:54,483
All right?

77
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:55,817
Now there,
you'd like to do that?

78
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:56,819
Okay!

79
00:07:58,456 --> 00:07:59,458
"Okay"?

80
00:08:11,235 --> 00:08:13,636
Why?

81
00:08:13,638 --> 00:08:15,504
I was thinking of getting
a bike for meself.

82
00:08:15,506 --> 00:08:16,772
You've got a fucking bike, Adam.

83
00:08:16,774 --> 00:08:18,941
It's his old one.
He rode around that...

84
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,709
You're not doing a fucking thing

85
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:22,681
without me from now on.
Do you understand?

86
00:08:24,682 --> 00:08:25,750
Yes.

87
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:28,851
Is there any left?

88
00:08:30,355 --> 00:08:31,356
No.

89
00:08:36,427 --> 00:08:37,730
You fuck.

90
00:08:40,498 --> 00:08:43,201
He fucking tricked me.
I had no fucking idea.

91
00:09:09,628 --> 00:09:10,663
You all right?

92
00:09:59,644 --> 00:10:00,810
Hand 'em over.

93
00:10:00,812 --> 00:10:03,079
- What?
- Do you think I'm dumb?

94
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:03,946
Jesus Christ!

95
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:05,783
Never mind the blasphemy.
Give 'em here.

96
00:10:08,852 --> 00:10:09,854
Are we clear?

97
00:10:11,022 --> 00:10:13,623
<i>I don't give a fuck how
many of these you swallow</i>

98
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,791
<i>or you stick up your arse
when you're not here.</i>

99
00:10:15,793 --> 00:10:17,663
But in the club,
these are banned.

100
00:10:18,797 --> 00:10:19,798
Them the rules.

101
00:10:20,065 --> 00:10:21,433
Piss off.

102
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:24,502
Oi, Paddo.

103
00:10:26,471 --> 00:10:28,031
Check that other one
on the side.

104
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:31,373
TVs?

105
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,543
Yeah.

106
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:34,913
Huge ones.

107
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,783
Katrina's idea. Like 'em?

108
00:10:39,017 --> 00:10:41,084
Youse didn't come to me.

109
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,692
What happened to you?

110
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:55,834
You know what? Give Knuck and I
45 minutes before you come in.

111
00:10:58,001 --> 00:10:59,337
He's only gotten out.

112
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:03,808
Well, then, tell me what you wanna
tell him, and I'll pass it on.

113
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,581
Or don't.

114
00:11:32,903 --> 00:11:35,872
Push back on the gun. Push back on
the gun, you fucking weird cunt.

115
00:12:04,635 --> 00:12:08,871
Listen to me. You need to take
charge as soon as you get out.

116
00:12:08,873 --> 00:12:10,006
Oh, I am in charge.

117
00:12:10,008 --> 00:12:12,574
Nah. It's not the same
when you're in here.

118
00:12:12,576 --> 00:12:14,209
Listen, Hayley,

119
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:16,478
Paddo will fall in
when I get out.

120
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,051
And he's gonna do that
because I put him there.

121
00:12:20,018 --> 00:12:21,783
I don't trust him.

122
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:24,923
You don't trust anyone.

123
00:12:30,094 --> 00:12:31,661
He tried to fuck you, did he?

124
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:33,728
Nah.

125
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,890
No, he didn't try to fuck me.

126
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:39,234
Just show him
you're the president,

127
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:41,439
and do it so the men can see it.

128
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:47,613
They gotten bigger?

129
00:12:51,014 --> 00:12:53,782
You just puffed yourself
out like a toadfish.

130
00:12:53,784 --> 00:12:55,517
I didn't do anything.

131
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,054
No. Bigger.

132
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,589
- You look good.
- Really?

133
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:01,927
Way bigger.

134
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:08,667
I love you.

135
00:13:37,995 --> 00:13:38,996
What did she say?

136
00:13:41,265 --> 00:13:43,065
She said you are
trying to fuck her.

137
00:13:47,871 --> 00:13:49,040
I've got a proposition.

138
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:51,709
From who?

139
00:13:52,744 --> 00:13:53,812
Devils.

140
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:57,179
And what is it?

141
00:13:58,182 --> 00:13:59,817
They can wash our paper.

142
00:14:02,186 --> 00:14:03,286
Can they?

143
00:14:03,288 --> 00:14:05,021
Knuck, there's too much
of it, mate.

144
00:14:05,023 --> 00:14:06,321
It's useless if we
can't filter it.

145
00:14:06,323 --> 00:14:07,725
If we wash it,

146
00:14:08,826 --> 00:14:09,995
we can buy assets.

147
00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:13,094
Legit.

148
00:14:13,096 --> 00:14:15,667
Renovate the clubhouse.
We can buy a house.

149
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:18,228
Well, that'll be good,
wouldn't it?

150
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:20,739
And what'll they want?

151
00:14:21,306 --> 00:14:23,039
Thirty percent.

152
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,910
- Which is nothing.
- No.

153
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,175
It's 30%.

154
00:14:27,177 --> 00:14:28,614
Sugar come to you
with this thing?

155
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:31,916
Yes.

156
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:36,017
Oh.

157
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:38,459
So, what, you and Sugar are
fucking best friends now, are you?

158
00:14:44,162 --> 00:14:45,631
It's a good deal, Knuck.

159
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,003
I wouldn't be coming to you
if it wasn't.

160
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,111
You got to think about it.

161
00:15:05,115 --> 00:15:06,748
What happened to you face?

162
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,922
A little scrap at the pub.
Some fucking muppet.

163
00:15:11,355 --> 00:15:12,988
How's Skink?

164
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,991
Good. Yeah.

165
00:15:14,993 --> 00:15:17,162
Besides whacking too much
in the shower, he's good.

166
00:15:19,897 --> 00:15:21,099
All right.

167
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,901
You set it up with
your mate Sugar.

168
00:15:25,903 --> 00:15:28,070
But you set it up day
one I get out next week.

169
00:15:28,072 --> 00:15:29,405
You understand that?

170
00:15:29,407 --> 00:15:31,143
- Day one.
- Okay.

171
00:15:46,157 --> 00:15:47,158
What did he say?

172
00:15:49,192 --> 00:15:50,227
He said yes?

173
00:15:51,962 --> 00:15:53,598
He said he'd set up a meeting.

174
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:55,100
A meeting?

175
00:15:55,966 --> 00:15:56,968
With who?

176
00:15:58,669 --> 00:15:59,868
Sugar.

177
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,139
When?

178
00:16:04,274 --> 00:16:05,276
When he gets out?

179
00:16:06,977 --> 00:16:08,879
- Yes.
- Shit, Mark.

180
00:16:18,221 --> 00:16:19,954
Baby.

181
00:16:19,956 --> 00:16:22,958
We got to be careful.

182
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,797
He gets out after three years and
we just hand everything over to him?

183
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,201
It's not like that.

184
00:16:30,701 --> 00:16:33,138
It's good business, Kat.
It legitimizes everything.

185
00:16:35,306 --> 00:16:36,675
He'll see that.

186
00:16:40,144 --> 00:16:41,178
And Skink's okay.

187
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:51,889
You should be president,
you know that?

188
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,760
He couldn't have done
what you've done.

189
00:16:57,228 --> 00:16:58,830
He doesn't have the brains.

190
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:07,004
Do you know what those men
see in you?

191
00:17:09,307 --> 00:17:10,709
What I see in you?

192
00:17:13,376 --> 00:17:14,712
We'd die for you.

193
00:18:07,531 --> 00:18:09,931
You don't utter my name
to anyone.

194
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:11,967
You do it and I'll find out.

195
00:18:11,969 --> 00:18:13,936
Then I'll murder some cunt
just to get back in here

196
00:18:13,938 --> 00:18:15,273
so I can cut your throat.

197
00:18:16,941 --> 00:18:18,407
You understand?

198
00:18:42,834 --> 00:18:43,969
Stop it now.

199
00:18:48,972 --> 00:18:50,207
It's okay.

200
00:18:51,308 --> 00:18:52,778
Shh.

201
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:10,392
Where's your drink, dude?

202
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:12,505
You're an idiot, Webby. You
know it's fucking Ramadan?

203
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:15,064
- Ramadan?
- Mmm.

204
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:16,364
- Fuck Ramadan.
- Fuck Ramadan.

205
00:19:16,366 --> 00:19:18,033
- And fuck you.
- Fuck me?

206
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:20,603
It's a bar.
You're here to drink.

207
00:19:20,605 --> 00:19:22,537
You don't like it,
you can fuck off.

208
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:24,373
Hey, you're a fat cunt, Webby.

209
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,807
Count these...

210
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:28,409
Skinks, Paddo reckons you got
in a bit of a scrap the other night.

211
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,216
Yeah, yeah.

212
00:19:33,483 --> 00:19:35,351
So, how many
were there, brother?

213
00:19:35,353 --> 00:19:36,919
I don't know,
they all look the same.

214
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:38,386
They're all a bunch
of perm heads.

215
00:19:40,023 --> 00:19:42,391
So, did you flog 'em or what?

216
00:19:42,393 --> 00:19:45,526
Yeah, well... One of
them hit me in the face.

217
00:19:45,528 --> 00:19:47,395
I had blood
coming out of my nose,

218
00:19:47,397 --> 00:19:50,199
so I got him in an arm bar,

219
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:52,567
and then I broke
his femur, and the...

220
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:54,003
That's enough.

221
00:19:54,005 --> 00:19:55,373
That's enough, man.

222
00:19:57,942 --> 00:19:59,674
Even this will keep you
in the camp for a week.

223
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:00,878
Jesus.

224
00:20:01,913 --> 00:20:03,011
You should follow me down.

225
00:20:03,013 --> 00:20:05,014
Shot you a rim job
with me missus.

226
00:20:05,016 --> 00:20:06,351
Got a tongue like a lizard.

227
00:20:07,518 --> 00:20:10,552
Oh, come on.

228
00:20:10,554 --> 00:20:12,390
Dib's gonna need
a little extra this week.

229
00:20:14,592 --> 00:20:16,926
He got fired. It was a layoff thing.
It wasn't his fault, all right?

230
00:20:16,928 --> 00:20:17,929
He needs a hand.

231
00:20:41,117 --> 00:20:42,419
Look at you.

232
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,557
You could have got
a nom to come and get me.

233
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,429
Please. They can't hit 50
without shitting their pants.

234
00:20:55,432 --> 00:20:57,565
Did you look after him?

235
00:20:57,567 --> 00:20:58,936
Fucking, nos.

236
00:21:13,284 --> 00:21:15,020
- Wanna go home?
- Yeah.

237
00:21:27,097 --> 00:21:28,265
Yeah.

238
00:21:29,432 --> 00:21:31,001
Push your fucking back on it.
Push.

239
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:34,105
Fuck!

240
00:21:45,516 --> 00:21:46,518
Give it here.

241
00:21:57,761 --> 00:21:59,163
Oi.

242
00:22:08,705 --> 00:22:10,140
It's the way it should be.

243
00:22:21,652 --> 00:22:23,054
Thank you.

244
00:22:26,156 --> 00:22:27,258
I missed you.

245
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:30,627
I really fucking missed you.

246
00:22:31,662 --> 00:22:33,264
Yeah, I missed you too.

247
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:37,035
What was it like in there?

248
00:22:38,169 --> 00:22:39,537
You saw me in there.

249
00:22:40,403 --> 00:22:41,670
That's what it's like.

250
00:22:41,672 --> 00:22:43,508
Anyone try to come after you?

251
00:22:44,674 --> 00:22:46,076
And do what?

252
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:49,545
Give you the bash or something?

253
00:22:51,414 --> 00:22:52,547
- Bash?
- Yeah.

254
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:55,552
Nah. No one tried
to give me the bash.

255
00:22:58,422 --> 00:22:59,591
'Cause you're not going back.

256
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:02,625
You're right.

257
00:23:05,462 --> 00:23:07,531
I wanna try for
a kid again, Knuck.

258
00:23:52,242 --> 00:23:54,676
What, Knuck wants his own
song to come in to, does he?

259
00:23:54,678 --> 00:23:56,245
What, his own national anthem?

260
00:23:59,482 --> 00:24:00,585
Knuck!

261
00:24:01,652 --> 00:24:03,688
Jeez! You look big.

262
00:24:04,421 --> 00:24:05,423
Or bigger.

263
00:24:06,923 --> 00:24:08,526
You still got that, uh,

264
00:24:09,492 --> 00:24:11,293
skinny flexing arm?

265
00:24:11,295 --> 00:24:12,630
Why, sure. Bomber.

266
00:24:16,733 --> 00:24:19,367
You're still a vodka and
orange man, aren't you, Knuck?

267
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:22,270
Hey, look. A nice little pink
umbrella there for you, too.

268
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,706
Or do you want me to get you
a low carb beer?

269
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:25,641
Or maybe even a light?

270
00:24:25,643 --> 00:24:27,545
How about we just
get down to business, huh?

271
00:24:28,778 --> 00:24:30,682
Yeah, sure, Paddo.

272
00:24:32,816 --> 00:24:35,383
Paddo tells me you want
30% to clean our paper.

273
00:24:35,385 --> 00:24:36,553
Correct weight.

274
00:24:37,922 --> 00:24:39,621
Okay.

275
00:24:39,623 --> 00:24:40,788
What happens then?

276
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,359
Oh, you'll make money.

277
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,227
Legitimate money.

278
00:24:45,229 --> 00:24:47,863
And you're not gonna try and
renegotiate your fee or anything?

279
00:24:47,865 --> 00:24:50,231
Nah! You have my word.

280
00:24:52,303 --> 00:24:54,670
Back the fuck up.

281
00:24:54,672 --> 00:24:56,837
And stay real fucking...

282
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:58,239
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

283
00:24:58,241 --> 00:24:59,810
Hey, look at me.

284
00:25:00,678 --> 00:25:01,846
You think it's funny?

285
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,812
Can you read that?

286
00:25:03,814 --> 00:25:04,880
Right?

287
00:25:04,882 --> 00:25:06,315
That says "president."

288
00:25:06,317 --> 00:25:09,218
So I'm still the president,
not him.

289
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,852
Not him. You ask me.

290
00:25:10,854 --> 00:25:13,488
So, if I ever catch you talking
to any of my men about business,

291
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,724
I'll tie a dishwasher
around your ankles,

292
00:25:15,726 --> 00:25:17,726
and I'll drop you
in one of your billabongs.

293
00:25:28,605 --> 00:25:31,739
Hey, Knuck, you forgot to drink
your vodka and orange juice,

294
00:25:31,741 --> 00:25:33,344
you fucking rude cunt.

295
00:25:38,015 --> 00:25:39,751
Can you please put
your shirt on, mate?

296
00:25:52,895 --> 00:25:54,528
Oh, you all right?

297
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,600
- I'm sorry.
- Jeez!

298
00:25:59,903 --> 00:26:01,206
Fuck.

299
00:26:03,606 --> 00:26:04,808
What are you reading?

300
00:26:07,411 --> 00:26:08,910
New cars?

301
00:26:08,912 --> 00:26:11,479
Mark doesn't drive cars,
just Harleys.

302
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:12,913
Yeah, well, I'll be
driving it, won't I?

303
00:26:12,915 --> 00:26:15,484
Are you driving to
Knuck's party tonight?

304
00:26:15,486 --> 00:26:16,766
I'm gonna try and be with Josie.

305
00:26:17,954 --> 00:26:19,756
I don't think that's
a very good idea.

306
00:26:20,657 --> 00:26:22,024
Why?

307
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:23,894
Because you and her
are different.

308
00:26:25,796 --> 00:26:27,599
You're different than Mark.

309
00:26:32,836 --> 00:26:35,437
Well, I just don't think she'll
be very nice to you, okay?

310
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:37,508
She's nice to me. She's
nice to me all the time.

311
00:26:39,843 --> 00:26:41,109
Hey, one on the pokeys.

312
00:26:41,111 --> 00:26:43,045
- What happened?
- Oh, he threw it straight back at Sugar.

313
00:26:43,047 --> 00:26:44,946
That was supposed
to get Skink square, Mark.

314
00:26:44,948 --> 00:26:46,484
Do you realize what that means?

315
00:26:47,951 --> 00:26:49,751
If Knuck doesn't do this,
I'll kill him, Mark.

316
00:26:50,354 --> 00:26:51,920
You need to convince him.

317
00:26:51,922 --> 00:26:53,490
I'll take care of it.

318
00:27:35,932 --> 00:27:37,835
What the fuck is he wearing?

319
00:27:38,868 --> 00:27:40,337
We got new hoodies.

320
00:27:41,505 --> 00:27:42,907
Take it off.

321
00:27:44,107 --> 00:27:45,539
What?

322
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:46,877
What are you looking at him for?

323
00:27:49,512 --> 00:27:51,014
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

324
00:27:52,648 --> 00:27:54,885
Well, you seem like a real
fucking prospect, don't you?

325
00:27:56,987 --> 00:27:58,523
Who are you?

326
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:00,557
I'm David Seamus.

327
00:28:01,057 --> 00:28:02,693
He's an accountant.

328
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,040
So you've been
counting my money?

329
00:28:06,563 --> 00:28:07,696
Yeah.

330
00:28:07,698 --> 00:28:09,564
You look at him again while
I'm asking you a question,

331
00:28:09,566 --> 00:28:11,006
I'm gonna bite
your fucking nose off.

332
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,605
He's a good kid, Knuck.

333
00:28:16,906 --> 00:28:17,906
We could use him.

334
00:28:22,512 --> 00:28:23,714
I'll tell you what, David.

335
00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:26,715
You take that thing off,

336
00:28:26,717 --> 00:28:28,820
go outside and put it
in that big fire.

337
00:28:33,423 --> 00:28:34,892
- Fuck off.
- Yeah.

338
00:28:38,028 --> 00:28:41,462
- They're banned.
- Why?

339
00:28:41,464 --> 00:28:43,834
Because we're a 1% club,
not a fucking netball team.

340
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:52,974
Hey, Notu, do us
a favor, would ya?

341
00:28:52,976 --> 00:28:55,075
- Yo.
- Take off the hoodies, whoever's got 'em.

342
00:28:55,077 --> 00:28:57,478
Fuck! I knew he wouldn't
have liked them.

343
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:18,001
Hey, Josie.

344
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:19,968
Hi, Adam.

345
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,670
What are you doing?

346
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:23,037
Talking to you.

347
00:29:44,961 --> 00:29:46,096
You got a new tat.

348
00:29:46,963 --> 00:29:48,098
Yeah.

349
00:29:48,932 --> 00:29:50,067
I got it for Knuck.

350
00:29:52,102 --> 00:29:53,905
I'm thinking of getting
one on me bonnet.

351
00:29:54,872 --> 00:29:56,770
You know, as a surprise.

352
00:29:56,772 --> 00:29:58,139
Why the fuck would you do that?

353
00:29:58,141 --> 00:30:00,044
'Cause he would fucking love it.

354
00:30:03,547 --> 00:30:04,949
Do you want any drugs?

355
00:30:05,516 --> 00:30:06,882
I got some.

356
00:30:06,884 --> 00:30:09,150
You know we're not allowed to
in the clubhouse, Skink.

357
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,855
You don't have to pay for any.

358
00:30:18,662 --> 00:30:19,963
What would I have to do?

359
00:30:22,031 --> 00:30:23,134
What would you do?

360
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:26,203
Would I have to fuck you?

361
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:29,136
You can if you want.

362
00:30:29,138 --> 00:30:30,640
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

363
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,145
Let me think about it.

364
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,128
You make sure that every nom
can ride from here on.

365
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,565
Every one of them.

366
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:59,034
I'll get 'em around to it.

367
00:30:59,036 --> 00:31:01,937
I don't care if you make him jump
through rings of fucking fire, Webby.

368
00:31:01,939 --> 00:31:03,941
Just make sure they don't
embarrass me on a run.

369
00:31:07,044 --> 00:31:09,177
Come out and have
a drink with your men.

370
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:12,016
You haven't seen most
of them for three years.

371
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,682
Go talk to 'em.

372
00:31:14,684 --> 00:31:15,917
About what?

373
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,022
I don't know.
Ask them how they've been.

374
00:31:20,123 --> 00:31:21,259
Can you move for a sec?

375
00:31:21,892 --> 00:31:23,059
Please?

376
00:31:28,632 --> 00:31:30,931
I swear on this nom.

377
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:32,103
This accountant.

378
00:31:35,105 --> 00:31:36,105
You look good, bro.

379
00:31:56,727 --> 00:31:58,062
Whoa!

380
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:04,099
You had enough, Noisy?

381
00:32:04,101 --> 00:32:06,267
You nominated this prick,
all right?

382
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:09,004
You're gonna look him in the eye
and flog him like I flogged you.

383
00:32:09,006 --> 00:32:10,107
Hear that, Noisy? Look up.

384
00:32:19,148 --> 00:32:20,748
Stand him up.
Stand him up, Webby.

385
00:32:21,117 --> 00:32:23,019
Stand him up.

386
00:32:26,856 --> 00:32:30,659
You have David Seamus,
who's the fucking accountant.

387
00:32:30,661 --> 00:32:32,763
Do you swear allegiance to me,

388
00:32:33,997 --> 00:32:36,296
and the Copperhead
Motorcycle Club, Australia?

389
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:37,798
- Yes.
- Yeah?

390
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,967
Yeah.

391
00:32:38,969 --> 00:32:40,304
- To me?
- Yes.

392
00:32:46,343 --> 00:32:47,945
Look at me.

393
00:32:48,178 --> 00:32:50,010
Hmm?

394
00:32:56,286 --> 00:32:57,654
Hmm?

395
00:33:07,329 --> 00:33:10,033
So... I'm back.

396
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:14,068
And there's a lot of faces
here I don't know.

397
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,550
I've never seen 'em
before in my life.

398
00:33:16,338 --> 00:33:17,875
I have no idea who you are.

399
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:21,329
I don't know
who the fuck you are.

400
00:33:22,813 --> 00:33:24,215
But you've all been vouched for.

401
00:33:26,148 --> 00:33:27,348
So I will say what, we'll see.

402
00:33:29,219 --> 00:33:32,155
You wanna nominate anyone,
you bring him before me.

403
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:34,290
Me only.

404
00:33:35,192 --> 00:33:36,324
You understand?

405
00:33:36,326 --> 00:33:37,392
Yes.

406
00:33:37,394 --> 00:33:38,492
Answer your pres!

407
00:33:38,494 --> 00:33:39,827
Yes!

408
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:41,261
Get him up.

409
00:33:41,263 --> 00:33:42,330
Come on, come on.

410
00:33:46,303 --> 00:33:47,901
I got you.

411
00:33:52,509 --> 00:33:54,244
All the best.

412
00:34:00,217 --> 00:34:01,419
Copperhead forever!

413
00:34:03,286 --> 00:34:04,853
Copperhead forever!

414
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:09,090
Webby, love him up, sew him up.

415
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:31,505
Thanks.

416
00:35:35,344 --> 00:35:36,980
Welcome back, Pres.

417
00:35:39,882 --> 00:35:41,883
Looks like a big fucking lolly.

418
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,893
Already got a bike.

419
00:35:52,329 --> 00:35:54,162
Hey!

420
00:35:54,164 --> 00:35:57,130
Someone's gonna work dick
and that's me!

421
00:36:02,606 --> 00:36:04,438
Bloody Tracey, everybody.

422
00:36:12,514 --> 00:36:13,648
Pay up.

423
00:36:16,518 --> 00:36:17,854
Bullshit.

424
00:36:45,949 --> 00:36:47,414
You're fucking smoking.

425
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:48,585
Stop it.

426
00:36:50,387 --> 00:36:52,222
- Boost!
- Fluke.

427
00:36:53,422 --> 00:36:55,088
No, it's not.

428
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,426
I never miss. I'm too good.

429
00:37:02,932 --> 00:37:04,367
Good shot.

430
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:18,448
That bike looks very flash.

431
00:37:26,155 --> 00:37:28,291
I thought you were gonna
take care of this, Mark.

432
00:37:36,498 --> 00:37:38,166
Knuck, can I have a word?

433
00:37:38,168 --> 00:37:39,434
In a minute?

434
00:37:39,436 --> 00:37:40,571
Right now.

435
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:51,112
Yeah, what now? It must feel
different being out, I know.

436
00:37:51,114 --> 00:37:54,581
Feel different being here. I've
only tried to make you feel welcome.

437
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:56,119
- Welcome?
- Yes, Knuck.

438
00:37:57,086 --> 00:37:59,153
In here, my club?

439
00:37:59,155 --> 00:38:01,021
- You asked me to look after things.
- Yeah.

440
00:38:01,023 --> 00:38:04,494
To look after the men.
I've done what you asked.

441
00:38:05,362 --> 00:38:07,260
- I wanted you to...
- What?

442
00:38:07,262 --> 00:38:09,262
I wanted to hand it back to you in
better shape than when you went in.

443
00:38:09,264 --> 00:38:11,100
More money, more men.

444
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:13,971
No trouble.

445
00:38:16,005 --> 00:38:17,604
Things are different now.

446
00:38:17,606 --> 00:38:18,740
If we're smart,
everything changes.

447
00:38:18,742 --> 00:38:21,108
We'll never have to look
over our shoulder ever again.

448
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,776
We never have to worry about money.

449
00:38:22,778 --> 00:38:24,612
We never have to
worry about other clubs.

450
00:38:24,614 --> 00:38:26,282
About the fucking Jacks?

451
00:38:27,617 --> 00:38:30,017
Oh, is that what your
fucking mate Sugar told you?

452
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:31,184
What the fuck
is your obsession with...

453
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:33,186
Listen. Listen to me.

454
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:35,523
And you listen really
fucking carefully.

455
00:38:35,525 --> 00:38:37,224
Things aren't different
out here now.

456
00:38:37,226 --> 00:38:38,461
Not while I'm involved.

457
00:38:39,128 --> 00:38:40,197
Hmm?

458
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,530
And I don't want anyone's help.

459
00:38:42,532 --> 00:38:43,697
Do you understand that?

460
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:45,566
And I'm not gonna split money,

461
00:38:45,568 --> 00:38:49,704
and I'm never, ever gonna sit around
the table with some other cunt

462
00:38:49,706 --> 00:38:54,307
from another club and talk about
how we can help each other.

463
00:38:54,309 --> 00:38:57,547
And I never asked you
to do any of that.

464
00:38:58,715 --> 00:39:00,017
Did I?

465
00:39:01,483 --> 00:39:03,019
- Did I? No.
- No.

466
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:08,155
Now, we've got more money.

467
00:39:08,157 --> 00:39:10,527
And we've got more men, for
good or bad, we're fine now.

468
00:39:11,795 --> 00:39:13,163
So thank you.

469
00:39:24,606 --> 00:39:26,576
What the fuck, Skink?
Shut the fuck up.

470
00:39:29,344 --> 00:39:30,513
So, what do you got?

471
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,579
I got some goey.

472
00:39:32,581 --> 00:39:34,648
Some speed?

473
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:36,416
Fuck that, Skink.

474
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:37,554
Wait.

475
00:39:38,588 --> 00:39:40,290
I got some hezza.

476
00:39:42,192 --> 00:39:43,858
It's mine.

477
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,592
But I'm not supposed to have it.

478
00:39:45,594 --> 00:39:48,064
So, you can't tell.

479
00:39:51,434 --> 00:39:53,370
If I give it to you,
you cannot tell.

480
00:39:58,574 --> 00:39:59,740
Do you like that?

481
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:22,132
Hey, brother!

482
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,306
Must be good to have him back.

483
00:40:30,306 --> 00:40:31,738
Yeah, it is.

484
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,480
Bet he can't keep
his hands off you.

485
00:40:37,146 --> 00:40:38,315
Yeah.

486
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:44,153
He did okay, your bloke.

487
00:40:45,922 --> 00:40:47,190
Yeah, he had some help.

488
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:50,626
Knuck will take it
from here but.

489
00:40:52,628 --> 00:40:53,628
Yeah, we'll see, I guess.

490
00:40:57,534 --> 00:40:59,202
I may not be that smart,

491
00:41:00,202 --> 00:41:02,302
but I do know
paying someone else

492
00:41:02,304 --> 00:41:04,304
to do something you can
do yourself

493
00:41:04,306 --> 00:41:05,675
is fucking stupid.

494
00:41:11,947 --> 00:41:14,447
Hey, hey...

495
00:41:14,449 --> 00:41:16,119
Josie licked my ears.

496
00:41:17,452 --> 00:41:20,556
Uh-huh? Just ears?

497
00:41:22,659 --> 00:41:24,361
She touched my dick too.

498
00:41:30,465 --> 00:41:32,666
I knew it! I fucking knew it!

499
00:41:32,668 --> 00:41:34,834
It's just...

500
00:41:34,836 --> 00:41:36,670
It's all just
part of the initiation.

501
00:41:36,672 --> 00:41:37,704
Yeah.

502
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:39,639
- It happened to me.
- Yeah.

503
00:41:39,641 --> 00:41:41,644
I had my nose broken
and everything.

504
00:41:42,945 --> 00:41:45,481
Yeah, yeah. Paddo told me.
Yeah, it's all good.

505
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:48,682
So where are you from?

506
00:41:48,684 --> 00:41:49,849
Uh, Sydney.

507
00:41:49,851 --> 00:41:51,552
Come over to go to uni.

508
00:41:51,554 --> 00:41:52,887
You're being a real
smart fucker.

509
00:41:56,326 --> 00:41:58,161
Smart fucker who
likes to ride motorbikes.

510
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:01,494
Sort of, yeah.

511
00:42:01,496 --> 00:42:03,798
I only started last year when
I met Katrina and Paddo, so...

512
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,868
And you like 'em?

513
00:42:05,867 --> 00:42:07,403
You like Paddo and Katrina?

514
00:42:09,005 --> 00:42:10,737
Yeah.

515
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:12,708
They're real good people.
Paddo...

516
00:42:14,376 --> 00:42:15,746
Really looks after his brother.

517
00:42:16,746 --> 00:42:17,780
Like no other.

518
00:42:19,748 --> 00:42:20,750
So, what are you riding?

519
00:42:21,617 --> 00:42:24,918
A, uh, Sportster.

520
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,722
Hmm.

521
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,020
You can ride that new thing
if you want.

522
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:38,465
That's your present.

523
00:42:38,467 --> 00:42:39,802
Not really my style.

524
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:46,677
I could teach you to ride.

525
00:42:49,445 --> 00:42:50,778
- If you want.
- Yeah.

526
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,280
All right.

527
00:42:52,282 --> 00:42:53,417
We could

528
00:42:54,916 --> 00:42:56,586
come a few rounds with me.

529
00:42:57,753 --> 00:42:58,753
Show you around.

530
00:42:59,956 --> 00:43:01,921
- You wanna?
- Yeah.

531
00:43:01,923 --> 00:43:03,490
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

532
00:43:03,492 --> 00:43:04,728
You're awesome.

533
00:43:07,929 --> 00:43:09,463
What the fuck are you doing?

534
00:43:09,465 --> 00:43:11,898
What the fuck are you...
I told you!

535
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,300
Get off me!

536
00:43:13,302 --> 00:43:14,568
Shut up, bitch.

537
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:15,936
Get off me!

538
00:43:15,938 --> 00:43:17,637
You fucking slut!

539
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:23,043
Let her go. Let her go.

540
00:43:23,045 --> 00:43:24,644
Get your hands off her.

541
00:43:24,646 --> 00:43:26,079
Let her go. What is going on?

542
00:43:26,081 --> 00:43:28,751
Look at her.
She's off her fucking chops.

543
00:43:32,355 --> 00:43:33,657
You fucking slut.

544
00:43:42,998 --> 00:43:46,333
Hey! Are you fucking stupid?

545
00:43:46,335 --> 00:43:49,836
Seriously! What the fuck is wrong with you?
What's this?

546
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:51,805
Jesus fucking...
Come here, you...

547
00:43:51,807 --> 00:43:55,443
I get out one fucking day.
I'm out one fucking day,

548
00:43:55,445 --> 00:43:56,976
and you want me to
go back to fucking prison?

549
00:43:56,978 --> 00:43:58,713
This is fucking heroin.

550
00:43:58,715 --> 00:43:59,947
It wasn't mine.

551
00:43:59,949 --> 00:44:01,849
It's not yours?
Where'd you get it?

552
00:44:01,851 --> 00:44:03,787
Where did you fucking get it?

553
00:44:05,655 --> 00:44:06,787
Who?

554
00:44:06,789 --> 00:44:07,991
- Who?
- Skink!

555
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:11,458
- Come here.
- I'm sorry Skink.

556
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,860
I didn't sell it to her.

557
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:15,464
I didn't sell it to her, Knuck.

558
00:44:18,501 --> 00:44:19,836
You gonna hit me?

559
00:44:26,876 --> 00:44:27,978
You simple fuck.

560
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,050
Your old man should have
drowned you at birth.

561
00:44:36,885 --> 00:44:38,519
You're out.

562
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:39,586
No, Knuck...

563
00:44:39,588 --> 00:44:42,155
Webby, you fat fuck,
take his cards.

564
00:44:42,157 --> 00:44:44,425
Knuck, I can... No!

565
00:44:44,427 --> 00:44:46,025
- No, no, Webby.
- Take it off.

566
00:44:46,027 --> 00:44:48,028
- No, this is my jacket!
- Take it off.

567
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:49,929
This is my jacket!

568
00:44:49,931 --> 00:44:52,091
- Take it off.
- I fought with this jacket! No! No, no!

569
00:44:54,436 --> 00:44:55,838
You know I didn't mean it.

570
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,539
Come on.

571
00:45:00,443 --> 00:45:01,976
Turn on the music.

572
00:45:01,978 --> 00:45:03,613
Turn it back on now.

573
00:45:14,023 --> 00:45:15,625
He pissed himself, Mark.

574
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:23,164
Okay, come on. It's all right.
You're all right.

575
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:24,731
You're all right, mate,
you're all right.

576
00:45:24,733 --> 00:45:25,932
Breathe.

577
00:45:25,934 --> 00:45:27,534
Come on, you're all right.

578
00:45:27,536 --> 00:45:29,470
You wanna take a shower?
Let's take a shower.

579
00:45:29,472 --> 00:45:30,938
Come on. Hey, hey, hey.

580
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,740
Let's take a shower.

581
00:46:40,009 --> 00:46:41,110
Ah, fuck.

582
00:46:44,112 --> 00:46:47,016
Hey, we're off? I think
we're done here, so...

583
00:46:48,684 --> 00:46:49,686
What's got into you?

584
00:47:08,538 --> 00:47:10,018
What are you doing?

585
00:47:17,746 --> 00:47:19,646
Let go of me, you fuckin' cunt.

586
00:47:19,648 --> 00:47:20,650
Get off me.

587
00:47:34,829 --> 00:47:35,896
Bugger.

588
00:47:35,898 --> 00:47:37,097
Shut up.

589
00:47:37,099 --> 00:47:38,535
Shut up.

590
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:30,152
Just throw your shit
on the fuckin' floor.

591
00:48:40,161 --> 00:48:41,230
Kid gone, eh?

592
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,302
I'll be outside doing some quin.

593
00:49:44,059 --> 00:49:45,295
We should move away from here.

594
00:49:47,329 --> 00:49:48,865
- Why?
- Just...

595
00:49:50,432 --> 00:49:51,701
Enjoy.

596
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,369
Where?

597
00:50:03,445 --> 00:50:05,179
Queensland.

598
00:50:06,715 --> 00:50:08,916
I fucking hate Queensland.

599
00:50:08,918 --> 00:50:10,217
Where else would you go?

600
00:50:10,219 --> 00:50:12,219
You wouldn't know anyone
there, Mark.

601
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:13,757
Yeah, that's the point.

602
00:50:18,193 --> 00:50:19,892
That's the point.

603
00:50:19,894 --> 00:50:21,230
I don't know anyone there.

604
00:50:25,233 --> 00:50:26,233
Fresh start.

605
00:50:31,106 --> 00:50:32,275
No baggage.

606
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:44,320
You listen to me,

607
00:50:45,487 --> 00:50:49,021
we're not going anywhere.

608
00:50:49,023 --> 00:50:52,194
We've worked too hard to get to where
we are, we're not giving that up.

609
00:50:57,233 --> 00:50:59,199
And I know you'll do
whatever it takes

610
00:50:59,201 --> 00:51:01,371
to look after us, that's
why I love you so much.

611
00:51:03,873 --> 00:51:05,139
That's why those men love you,

612
00:51:05,141 --> 00:51:07,110
that's why Knuck
is so fucking threatened.

613
00:51:09,077 --> 00:51:11,244
You are not the sort of man

614
00:51:11,246 --> 00:51:13,315
that walks away from anything.

615
00:51:55,157 --> 00:51:56,425
He won't budge.

616
00:51:58,293 --> 00:52:01,029
- Yeah, I know.
- I need more time.

617
00:52:08,003 --> 00:52:09,873
You don't have the numbers
to overthrow Knuck.

618
00:52:12,273 --> 00:52:14,176
- Maybe I do.
- No, you don't.

619
00:52:17,847 --> 00:52:20,447
And you know why?
Because he is the club.

620
00:52:20,449 --> 00:52:23,052
He is the president
and he is protection.

621
00:52:23,952 --> 00:52:25,184
And you're none of that.

622
00:52:25,186 --> 00:52:26,855
Give me a week
and I'll get it done.

623
00:52:28,489 --> 00:52:30,359
You're not fuckin' listening,
are you, Paddo?

624
00:52:32,027 --> 00:52:34,193
I don't wanna do
business with him.

625
00:52:34,195 --> 00:52:35,963
Because in the end,
he'll just fuck it up

626
00:52:35,965 --> 00:52:38,445
for no other reason other than
the fact that he likes to fight.

627
00:52:41,135 --> 00:52:42,438
But I wanna do
business with you.

628
00:52:45,474 --> 00:52:47,010
My advice?

629
00:52:48,309 --> 00:52:50,077
You take him out.

630
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,612
You'll live with what's left
and you keep building.

631
00:52:52,614 --> 00:52:55,148
Come into business with me and
you'll make more legitimate money

632
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:56,920
than you've ever made
in your fuckin' life.

633
00:52:59,021 --> 00:53:00,056
And if you don't,

634
00:53:01,356 --> 00:53:03,326
I'll kill your brother
by the end of the week.

635
00:53:10,365 --> 00:53:12,402
You kill him, you're
going to have to kill me.

636
00:53:15,271 --> 00:53:16,439
Yeah, I know.

637
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:31,221
Hey, Web.

638
00:53:31,487 --> 00:53:32,686
Hello.

639
00:53:32,688 --> 00:53:34,123
How you doing?

640
00:53:35,391 --> 00:53:36,423
Yeah, going good.

641
00:53:40,695 --> 00:53:42,431
Hey.

642
00:53:49,605 --> 00:53:50,907
What?

643
00:53:53,141 --> 00:53:55,041
What?

644
00:53:55,043 --> 00:53:57,145
First night out,
you could've come home.

645
00:53:58,681 --> 00:54:00,383
I fell asleep at the club.

646
00:54:06,722 --> 00:54:08,057
I'm here.

647
00:54:08,456 --> 00:54:09,458
Hmm?

648
00:54:19,001 --> 00:54:20,633
What are you doing?

649
00:54:20,635 --> 00:54:22,471
What the fuck does it
feel like I'm doing?

650
00:54:24,005 --> 00:54:25,440
- Something like that.
- Yeah?

651
00:54:26,976 --> 00:54:29,175
You still have it
when you're hungover.

652
00:54:29,177 --> 00:54:32,579
Stop it, please, Hayley,
just, not, hey...

653
00:54:32,581 --> 00:54:33,950
Stop it.

654
00:54:38,519 --> 00:54:40,487
Maybe you just getting old, eh?

655
00:54:43,492 --> 00:54:46,296
Maybe it's you getting old?

656
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:49,632
Maybe I don't wanna
stick it in you.

657
00:54:53,101 --> 00:54:54,202
You're a cunt.

658
00:55:13,155 --> 00:55:14,157
Hayley.

659
00:55:15,356 --> 00:55:18,325
Hayley! Hayley!

660
00:55:18,327 --> 00:55:20,330
Hayley, you know
I didn't fuckin' mean that.

661
00:55:29,637 --> 00:55:30,639
Mark.

662
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:34,177
Mark.

663
00:55:35,543 --> 00:55:37,246
Hey, Mark.

664
00:55:47,523 --> 00:55:48,992
What did he say?

665
00:55:50,391 --> 00:55:52,027
He said to kill Knuck.

666
00:55:58,434 --> 00:55:59,569
Rebuild.

667
00:56:01,369 --> 00:56:02,505
Take control.

668
00:56:05,239 --> 00:56:06,475
Go into business with him.

669
00:56:09,844 --> 00:56:11,580
And Skink's okay.

670
00:56:13,681 --> 00:56:15,017
So just do it,

671
00:56:15,684 --> 00:56:17,253
if that's the only way.

672
00:56:22,391 --> 00:56:24,027
Well, we'll do
what we talked about.

673
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:30,630
Run?

674
00:56:31,365 --> 00:56:32,568
It's not running.

675
00:56:35,704 --> 00:56:37,073
I don't need this.

676
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:44,211
I kill Knuck,

677
00:56:44,213 --> 00:56:46,278
ten years later, in the end,
it doesn't fuckin' matter,

678
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,549
someone kills me,

679
00:56:48,382 --> 00:56:49,451
Skink,

680
00:56:51,719 --> 00:56:53,121
or you.

681
00:56:57,759 --> 00:56:58,759
Kill him.

682
00:57:00,394 --> 00:57:01,597
Save your brother.

683
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:38,666
Can I sit down?

684
00:58:02,724 --> 00:58:03,724
Where'd you get this?

685
00:58:04,659 --> 00:58:06,128
Dad's stuff.

686
00:58:06,762 --> 00:58:08,464
It's me bookmark.

687
00:58:23,644 --> 00:58:24,844
We'll be all right, eh?

688
00:58:24,846 --> 00:58:26,813
Yeah.

689
00:58:26,815 --> 00:58:28,315
Always have been, haven't we?

690
00:58:28,317 --> 00:58:29,418
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

691
00:58:34,755 --> 00:58:35,757
Knuck.

692
00:58:50,905 --> 00:58:52,240
That your choice?

693
00:58:56,411 --> 00:58:57,746
I choose my brother.

694
00:58:59,847 --> 00:59:01,615
You're out as well then.

695
00:59:01,617 --> 00:59:03,916
No, he's not
gonna survive by himself.

696
00:59:03,918 --> 00:59:05,754
He's your fuckin' brother too.

697
00:59:06,855 --> 00:59:08,824
He's a brother to
every single one of ya.

698
00:59:13,894 --> 00:59:15,654
Did you tell the men
what you've turned down?

699
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,402
Your brothers?

700
00:59:20,735 --> 00:59:22,635
Money.

701
00:59:22,637 --> 00:59:25,304
Hundreds of thousands.

702
00:59:25,306 --> 00:59:28,441
A chance for every one
in the club to share in it.

703
00:59:28,443 --> 00:59:29,679
To build something legitimate.

704
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,713
Something that Jacks
can't touch,

705
00:59:34,715 --> 00:59:36,315
but you didn't want that,
did you, Knuck?

706
00:59:36,784 --> 00:59:37,784
No.

707
00:59:41,056 --> 00:59:42,758
You've been like
a fuckin' father to me.

708
00:59:47,596 --> 00:59:49,231
You're a dumb cunt, Knuck.

709
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,833
You know what your fuckin'
problem is, do you?

710
00:59:53,835 --> 00:59:54,835
Tell me.

711
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:57,672
You're not fucking real.

712
00:59:58,472 --> 00:59:59,608
You're a fake.

713
01:00:01,643 --> 01:00:04,476
You like all this, you like
the leather, you like the ink.

714
01:00:04,478 --> 01:00:06,780
You like the motorbikes.

715
01:00:06,782 --> 01:00:09,986
Then you might as well
be a male model or a fag.

716
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,655
Yeah, you're right, Knuck.

717
01:00:16,358 --> 01:00:17,793
Maybe I am a fake.

718
01:00:22,597 --> 01:00:23,733
We've all got our secrets.

719
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:29,438
Don't we?

720
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:32,541
Don't we?

721
01:00:39,815 --> 01:00:40,914
Knuck, fuck you.

722
01:00:44,952 --> 01:00:46,653
Take your fuckin' hands off him.

723
01:00:46,655 --> 01:00:47,787
Put the fuckin' gun down
before I shove it up your arse!

724
01:00:47,789 --> 01:00:49,923
Shut the fuck up,
you black cunt!

725
01:00:49,925 --> 01:00:51,961
I'm the fucking president. Me.

726
01:00:52,893 --> 01:00:55,494
You understand? Knuck!

727
01:00:55,496 --> 01:00:56,862
You're with me or you're not.

728
01:00:56,864 --> 01:00:58,565
It's okay, it's okay.

729
01:00:58,567 --> 01:00:59,568
It's okay.

730
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:18,952
- Fuckin' pussy.
- Fuck off.

731
01:01:43,512 --> 01:01:46,912
- Fuck Knuck.
- Fuck him.

732
01:01:54,188 --> 01:01:55,590
Fuck Knuck!

733
01:01:56,757 --> 01:01:58,793
I want sluts. Ah!

734
01:02:01,797 --> 01:02:04,463
Oi, what's this shit? What the
fuck happened to your face?

735
01:02:05,934 --> 01:02:07,733
What happened to you?

736
01:02:07,735 --> 01:02:09,601
Knuck did it, he threw him out.

737
01:02:09,603 --> 01:02:11,439
No, Knuck...
He didn't throw me out.

738
01:02:13,742 --> 01:02:14,977
Well, if...

739
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,481
You're out.

740
01:02:21,081 --> 01:02:22,481
Get the fuck!

741
01:02:22,483 --> 01:02:23,950
- What?
- What the fuck...

742
01:02:26,086 --> 01:02:27,889
Hey, hey, hey.

743
01:02:28,923 --> 01:02:30,055
Fuck!

744
01:02:30,057 --> 01:02:31,590
Everyone get the fuck out now.

745
01:02:31,592 --> 01:02:32,861
Everyone get the fuck out!

746
01:02:33,628 --> 01:02:34,663
Now!

747
01:02:59,019 --> 01:03:00,088
Hey.

748
01:03:01,822 --> 01:03:03,856
He's made up his mind,
there's nothing I can do.

749
01:03:03,858 --> 01:03:05,090
Yeah, well, Mark didn't
do anything wrong.

750
01:03:05,092 --> 01:03:06,959
Yeah, but he chose.

751
01:03:06,961 --> 01:03:07,963
It's his brother.

752
01:03:09,164 --> 01:03:10,929
Yeah.

753
01:03:10,931 --> 01:03:13,833
A simpleton who can't
keep out of trouble,

754
01:03:13,835 --> 01:03:15,133
and you know what? Fuck Paddo.

755
01:03:15,135 --> 01:03:17,172
Knuck has done everything
for him.

756
01:03:19,608 --> 01:03:21,477
You really believe
that, don't you?

757
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:24,712
I know that.

758
01:03:26,146 --> 01:03:27,949
I thought you were smart.

759
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:31,019
He fucks around on you Hayls,

760
01:03:32,554 --> 01:03:33,720
with men.

761
01:03:33,722 --> 01:03:35,490
Oh, yeah?

762
01:03:36,724 --> 01:03:38,157
Yeah.

763
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:39,858
- You're pathetic.
- It's true.

764
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:40,862
Is it?

765
01:03:42,998 --> 01:03:45,197
All you wanna be is me.

766
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:48,001
I've seen it in
your crazy fuckin' eyes.

767
01:03:48,003 --> 01:03:49,135
Be you?

768
01:03:49,137 --> 01:03:50,003
Yeah.

769
01:03:50,005 --> 01:03:51,640
You got nothing I want.

770
01:03:52,139 --> 01:03:53,641
I got Knuck.

771
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:56,879
And I got the clubhouse.

772
01:03:58,646 --> 01:04:01,079
You go in there,

773
01:04:01,081 --> 01:04:03,485
and I'll have your
fucking teeth kicked in.

774
01:04:05,554 --> 01:04:06,920
Now, fuck off.

775
01:04:06,922 --> 01:04:07,990
Okay.

776
01:04:25,172 --> 01:04:27,175
Here, Knuck asked me
to get it for you.

777
01:04:27,909 --> 01:04:29,575
Hey.

778
01:04:29,577 --> 01:04:30,612
What are you doing here?

779
01:04:31,313 --> 01:04:32,711
Huh?

780
01:04:32,713 --> 01:04:33,916
Shouldn't you be with Paddo?

781
01:05:36,744 --> 01:05:37,813
She's hot.

782
01:05:39,947 --> 01:05:41,115
Yeah.

783
01:05:54,695 --> 01:05:56,998
I spoke to Mark, he
made a deal with Sugar.

784
01:06:01,036 --> 01:06:02,137
What deal?

785
01:06:03,204 --> 01:06:06,141
Hmm, doesn't matter, 'cause

786
01:06:07,275 --> 01:06:08,777
he's not gonna take it.

787
01:06:12,313 --> 01:06:14,115
So we're gonna have to move.

788
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:18,016
Mmm, go on the run actually.

789
01:06:18,018 --> 01:06:19,184
Why?

790
01:06:19,186 --> 01:06:20,889
Where are we gonna go?

791
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:23,325
I don't know.

792
01:06:27,061 --> 01:06:30,429
Everything he's worked so hard for, just...

793
01:06:30,431 --> 01:06:31,733
Gone.

794
01:06:35,003 --> 01:06:37,840
And we'll be looking over our
shoulder forever, you know why?

795
01:06:41,175 --> 01:06:42,710
Because you mucked up.

796
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:44,379
Adam.

797
01:06:45,313 --> 01:06:46,715
Again.

798
01:06:53,722 --> 01:06:56,988
It's not all your fault, Knuck
shouldn't have kicked him out.

799
01:06:56,990 --> 01:06:58,760
He didn't do anything
wrong, did he?

800
01:07:01,463 --> 01:07:02,898
You did.

801
01:07:04,331 --> 01:07:05,768
Adam.

802
01:07:07,367 --> 01:07:08,670
Look at me.

803
01:07:10,739 --> 01:07:13,742
Mark might not love you
anymore after all this mess.

804
01:08:41,328 --> 01:08:42,448
The fuck are you doing here?

805
01:08:48,502 --> 01:08:50,104
I thought Knuck was here.

806
01:08:52,372 --> 01:08:53,372
No, he's not.

807
01:08:58,313 --> 01:09:00,379
Is that why you broke in,
so you could shoot him?

808
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:08,289
Yes, but not you, Hayley.

809
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:14,061
You need to leave, Adam.

810
01:09:15,395 --> 01:09:17,198
Go on, go home.

811
01:09:21,069 --> 01:09:22,300
You'll tell.

812
01:09:22,302 --> 01:09:23,404
No.

813
01:09:24,471 --> 01:09:25,471
I won't.

814
01:09:27,341 --> 01:09:30,476
I can't go home
unless I shoot him.

815
01:09:30,478 --> 01:09:32,077
Get the fuck...

816
01:10:02,342 --> 01:10:03,342
Kate.

817
01:10:04,545 --> 01:10:06,347
- You seen Skink?
- Mmm-mmm.

818
01:10:08,115 --> 01:10:09,350
He's not here?

819
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:13,255
Oi.

820
01:10:15,489 --> 01:10:16,524
Oi, hey.

821
01:10:20,962 --> 01:10:22,364
Skinky!

822
01:10:26,199 --> 01:10:27,469
Adam!

823
01:11:11,612 --> 01:11:13,949
Fuck!

824
01:11:16,117 --> 01:11:18,020
I just want you to love me.

825
01:11:20,454 --> 01:11:23,289
Mark, what's...

826
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:24,993
How could you say
those things to him?

827
01:11:26,194 --> 01:11:27,429
How could you do that?

828
01:11:28,128 --> 01:11:29,327
To him!

829
01:11:29,329 --> 01:11:30,528
Well, you weren't gonna do it.

830
01:11:30,530 --> 01:11:32,164
I can't fucking do it!

831
01:11:33,568 --> 01:11:36,134
Well, I'm sorry,
Mark, but he's gone.

832
01:11:36,136 --> 01:11:38,004
So take charge, man up.

833
01:11:41,042 --> 01:11:43,211
He fuckin' shot Hayley.

834
01:12:09,804 --> 01:12:11,570
Hayley, who? Who, who, who?

835
01:12:11,572 --> 01:12:13,339
- Who?
- Where were you?

836
01:12:13,341 --> 01:12:14,673
Fuck off, cunt!

837
01:12:14,675 --> 01:12:16,709
Who? Tell me.

838
01:12:16,711 --> 01:12:18,680
I told you not to trust him.

839
01:12:27,188 --> 01:12:29,548
- How many more?
- They're getting here as fast as they can.

840
01:12:30,224 --> 01:12:31,460
Fuckin'...

841
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:35,693
Come on, David and Burn,
cover the back door.

842
01:12:35,695 --> 01:12:38,033
Right! Up against the windows!

843
01:12:47,742 --> 01:12:49,411
You stay here, you understand?

844
01:12:51,546 --> 01:12:52,646
It'll be right, eh?

845
01:13:00,587 --> 01:13:02,088
Hey, Knuck, what's going on?

846
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:04,456
- Where are your colors?
- In the car.

847
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:06,224
- Go get 'em.
- What?

848
01:13:06,226 --> 01:13:07,496
Go and get 'em!

849
01:13:51,305 --> 01:13:52,871
I don't wanna do this.

850
01:13:52,873 --> 01:13:56,310
I don't want.
Please, don't do this.

851
01:13:58,712 --> 01:14:01,082
- Please don't.
- Get in the fucking car.

852
01:14:02,917 --> 01:14:04,553
You stay here, you die!

853
01:14:08,488 --> 01:14:09,490
Go.

854
01:14:11,626 --> 01:14:12,986
Fuckin' go!

855
01:14:54,702 --> 01:14:56,235
They're not coming,
let's just go.

856
01:14:56,237 --> 01:14:57,468
Fuck up!

857
01:14:57,470 --> 01:14:59,205
There's not enough of us, Motu.

858
01:14:59,207 --> 01:15:00,505
Well, fuck off then, cunt.

859
01:15:00,507 --> 01:15:02,427
I'm just saying, there's
only fuckin' four of us.

860
01:15:17,725 --> 01:15:20,428
Fuckin' hell. Oh, fuck.

861
01:15:20,728 --> 01:15:22,361
Oh, fuck, no.

862
01:15:22,363 --> 01:15:23,995
Oh, fuck.

863
01:15:23,997 --> 01:15:25,863
Oh, fuck!

864
01:15:25,865 --> 01:15:27,665
No! Fuck!

865
01:15:27,667 --> 01:15:28,670
Fuck! Fuck!

866
01:15:31,706 --> 01:15:33,705
Come on, man! We're not a fuckin'...

867
01:15:33,707 --> 01:15:34,906
The same.

868
01:15:34,908 --> 01:15:36,210
Shut the fuck up.

869
01:15:44,752 --> 01:15:46,884
- Dibs, go around the side.
- This is fuckin' easy for him.

870
01:15:46,886 --> 01:15:47,886
Motu, go with him.

871
01:15:49,256 --> 01:15:50,724
Do the fuckin' thing. Fuck.

872
01:16:31,798 --> 01:16:32,900
Fuck.

873
01:16:34,902 --> 01:16:36,768
- Fuck.
- What are you doing?

874
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:37,870
I can't do it, Motu!

875
01:16:37,872 --> 01:16:39,437
- You fuck...
- I'm fuckin' out of here.

876
01:16:39,439 --> 01:16:40,606
Get the fuck...

877
01:16:40,608 --> 01:16:42,641
What are you fuckin' doing?

878
01:16:42,643 --> 01:16:43,808
Come back here,

879
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:45,447
you fuckin' dog!

880
01:16:49,684 --> 01:16:51,650
Can we go through?

881
01:16:51,652 --> 01:16:52,951
All right, go, go, go, go.

882
01:16:52,953 --> 01:16:54,856
- Keep on fuckin' moving!
- Okay.

883
01:17:02,997 --> 01:17:04,332
Fuck.

884
01:17:08,903 --> 01:17:10,335
Webby, go out the front door.

885
01:17:10,337 --> 01:17:11,437
And do what?

886
01:17:11,439 --> 01:17:12,673
Fuckin' kick it in.

887
01:17:13,974 --> 01:17:15,777
Psst. Turn around, cunt.

888
01:17:16,844 --> 01:17:18,544
Shit!

889
01:17:18,546 --> 01:17:19,847
Fall back, fall in.

890
01:17:44,939 --> 01:17:47,740
Go, I'll get in the back,
go, go, go.

891
01:17:47,742 --> 01:17:49,511
Webby, you fuckin' go in,
go, go, go.

892
01:18:03,858 --> 01:18:06,023
- We're not going anywhere.
- You fuckin' go in!

893
01:18:06,025 --> 01:18:07,826
We're not going anywhere.

894
01:18:07,828 --> 01:18:11,129
- David!
- David, where are you fucking going?

895
01:18:11,131 --> 01:18:12,830
Come with me, you fuckin'...

896
01:18:14,068 --> 01:18:15,901
Where are you going,
you soft cunt?

897
01:18:15,903 --> 01:18:17,972
Get back here!

898
01:18:21,442 --> 01:18:23,511
Please, no.

899
01:18:30,784 --> 01:18:32,183
Go, fucking move!

900
01:18:32,185 --> 01:18:33,454
- Don't, don't, don't...
- Move!

901
01:18:35,055 --> 01:18:36,524
Please!

902
01:18:37,056 --> 01:18:38,022
Go, shoot him!

903
01:18:38,024 --> 01:18:39,059
Please!

904
01:18:41,028 --> 01:18:42,693
Fuck, fuck, go.

905
01:18:42,695 --> 01:18:44,729
Keep movin'.

906
01:18:44,731 --> 01:18:46,734
Go. Move, move, move.

907
01:18:47,935 --> 01:18:49,634
Don't look back, don't
look back, come on.

908
01:18:49,636 --> 01:18:51,005
Go, go, go. Fuckin' go.

909
01:20:08,047 --> 01:20:10,048
Hey, hey, shut the fuck up.

910
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:11,152
Shh.

911
01:20:36,277 --> 01:20:37,811
Oi, Mark.

912
01:20:43,716 --> 01:20:45,884
That didn't work out too
good for you, did it?

913
01:20:45,886 --> 01:20:47,052
Hmm?

914
01:20:47,054 --> 01:20:48,186
You came to kill me.

915
01:20:48,188 --> 01:20:49,287
Eh?

916
01:20:49,289 --> 01:20:50,492
I did.

917
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,562
I didn't mean to shoot Hayley.

918
01:20:56,896 --> 01:20:58,932
You sent a fuckin'
half-wit to do it?

919
01:21:00,935 --> 01:21:02,003
I wanted to

920
01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:05,202
'cause I don't like you, Knuck.

921
01:21:05,204 --> 01:21:08,542
- I fuckin' hate you.
- I don't fuckin' like you either, Adam.

922
01:21:10,210 --> 01:21:12,614
I fuckin' hate you,
you're a fucker.

923
01:21:15,215 --> 01:21:17,081
- Brother...
- What's that?

924
01:21:17,083 --> 01:21:20,251
No, see, David, he can't
go anywhere, can you?

925
01:21:20,253 --> 01:21:22,187
Right, 'cause he killed
a big, black cunt.

926
01:21:22,189 --> 01:21:23,789
You see, we're
all in this together.

927
01:21:23,791 --> 01:21:24,889
Including you.

928
01:21:24,891 --> 01:21:26,223
Fuck you!

929
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:33,635
Markie, Markie, look at me.

930
01:21:35,069 --> 01:21:36,602
- Move!
- No.

931
01:21:36,604 --> 01:21:37,902
Get out of the fucking way!

932
01:21:37,904 --> 01:21:39,773
- No.
- Get out of the fuckin' way.

933
01:21:41,742 --> 01:21:43,174
Get out of the fucking way!

934
01:21:43,176 --> 01:21:44,878
No! Do it!

935
01:21:45,179 --> 01:21:46,581
Do it!

936
01:21:48,282 --> 01:21:51,552
Do it, Knuck.
Do it, do it, do it.

937
01:21:52,086 --> 01:21:53,221
Shoot me!

938
01:21:59,627 --> 01:22:02,093
Mark, Mark, Mark.

939
01:22:02,095 --> 01:22:04,830
No, no, no,
please don't die, Markie.

940
01:22:04,832 --> 01:22:07,569
Hey, you'll be okay, Mark.

941
01:22:08,068 --> 01:22:09,068
Mark.

942
01:22:09,369 --> 01:22:10,835
No.

943
01:22:10,837 --> 01:22:13,237
No.

944
01:22:13,239 --> 01:22:14,608
Mark!

945
01:22:15,074 --> 01:22:16,407
Markie.

946
01:22:16,409 --> 01:22:18,210
Markie, look at me.

947
01:22:18,212 --> 01:22:20,411
You'll be all right, Markie.

948
01:22:44,003 --> 01:22:45,139
You'll be right.

949
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:48,710
We'll be right, Mark.

950
01:22:55,114 --> 01:22:56,117
Hey.

951
01:22:57,717 --> 01:22:59,052
Hey.

952
01:23:13,067 --> 01:23:14,268
Hey, Mark.

953
01:23:17,704 --> 01:23:19,006
We'll be right.

954
01:23:23,277 --> 01:23:24,679
Mmm.

955
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:01,302
You look good.

956
01:26:09,141 --> 01:26:10,144
Does that hurt?

957
01:26:12,345 --> 01:26:14,381
Must've started in here, did it?

958
01:26:15,649 --> 01:26:18,349
Where you got the taste?

959
01:26:18,351 --> 01:26:21,288
You think me fucking someone
like what, makes me what,

960
01:26:22,189 --> 01:26:23,858
a fuckin' fag?

961
01:26:27,493 --> 01:26:29,362
Not a fucking faggot.

962
01:26:32,064 --> 01:26:34,201
You see, in here or out there...

963
01:26:36,904 --> 01:26:38,439
It makes me a king.

964
01:26:42,074 --> 01:26:45,011
You tell yourself whatever
you need to, I don't care.

965
01:26:45,545 --> 01:26:48,079
I'm done.

966
01:26:48,081 --> 01:26:49,947
- You're done?
- Yeah.

967
01:26:49,949 --> 01:26:51,385
Webby's going to testify.

968
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:55,389
His sentence
is going to be suspended.

969
01:26:57,524 --> 01:26:58,889
You're out.

970
01:26:58,891 --> 01:27:02,563
He's going to be president. Well,
that's what we'll call him anyway.

971
01:27:03,930 --> 01:27:06,397
But it'll be me pulling
the strings,

972
01:27:06,399 --> 01:27:07,965
it's my club now,

973
01:27:07,967 --> 01:27:09,567
it's all you left me.

974
01:27:15,574 --> 01:27:16,574
It's never gonna happen.

975
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:21,582
It's fucking happened.

976
01:27:30,524 --> 01:27:32,126
Rot in hell.

977
01:27:34,493 --> 01:27:35,929
Hayley, sit down!

978
01:27:37,096 --> 01:27:38,595
Hayley!

979
01:27:38,597 --> 01:27:40,902
- Open up.
- Sit fuckin' back down.

980
01:27:41,301 --> 01:27:42,968
Hayley.

981
01:27:42,970 --> 01:27:44,472
Hayley!

982
01:27:45,471 --> 01:27:48,009
Fuck! Hayley!

983
01:28:08,028 --> 01:28:09,195
Hey.

984
01:28:10,463 --> 01:28:11,996
Good thing you're here.

985
01:28:11,998 --> 01:28:13,630
You can help me clean up.

986
01:28:13,632 --> 01:28:15,000
I want this place
fuckin' spark...

987
01:28:54,804 --> 01:29:02,804

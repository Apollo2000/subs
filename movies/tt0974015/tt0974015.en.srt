2
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,927
<i>There he is!</i>

3
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:54,062
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>

4
00:00:54,064 --> 00:00:57,631
<i>Superman, Superman,
can we ask you some questions?</i>

5
00:00:57,733 --> 00:00:59,099
<i>It's for our podcast.</i>

6
00:00:59,201 --> 00:01:00,334
Well, in that case...

7
00:01:00,536 --> 00:01:02,715
<i>How many people that
you saved... Have you saved?</i>

8
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:04,072
- I...
<i>- Never mind.</i>

9
00:01:04,074 --> 00:01:06,041
<i>Does your thing
really stand for hope?</i>

10
00:01:06,043 --> 00:01:07,142
Yes. It does.

11
00:01:07,144 --> 00:01:08,643
<i>But it looks like an "S."</i>

12
00:01:08,645 --> 00:01:10,946
Yes. It's meant to. It's...

13
00:01:10,948 --> 00:01:13,381
It's meant to wind like a river.

14
00:01:13,383 --> 00:01:15,252
It comes and goes. My...

15
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:20,521
A man I knew used to say that
hope is like your car keys.

16
00:01:20,523 --> 00:01:24,191
Easy to lose, but if you dig
around, it's usually close by.

17
00:01:24,193 --> 00:01:26,428
<i>Did you ever fight a hippo?</i>

18
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,862
<i>No. Shh. That's dumb.</i>

19
00:01:27,864 --> 00:01:29,497
<i>But hippos
are the most deadly.</i>

20
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,467
<i>What's the best thing
about Planet Earth?</i>

21
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:34,671
Hmm...

22
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,191
What are you doing?

23
00:03:04,193 --> 00:03:07,996
No, wait. No, wait. Wait. Wait!

24
00:03:07,998 --> 00:03:10,100
Please! Please, man. Please!

25
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:15,204
What do you want from me?

26
00:03:15,638 --> 00:03:17,538
Fear.

27
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,941
<i>They can smell it.</i>

28
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,338
What the hell?

29
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:33,751
- What was that?
- A scout.

30
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:36,151
From space?

31
00:04:36,153 --> 00:04:38,085
<i>Like an alien army?</i>

32
00:04:38,087 --> 00:04:39,987
<i>Alfred, are you seeing this?</i>

33
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:43,324
<i>I am.
Matches the other sightings.</i>

34
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:46,526
And that pattern
is all over Luthor's notes.

35
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:48,963
Prep the jet.
We're going north tonight.

36
00:04:48,965 --> 00:04:51,101
Good. It's time, then.

37
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,773
It's 'cause
they know he's dead, right?

38
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,841
Superman.

39
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:00,544
He's gone.

40
00:05:01,578 --> 00:05:03,046
<i>Where does that leave us?</i>

41
00:08:02,926 --> 00:08:04,294
Drop your guns now!

42
00:08:06,963 --> 00:08:08,295
Excuse me.

43
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,569
Go!

44
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:20,076
Move it! Move! Move!

45
00:08:23,345 --> 00:08:24,580
Get down!

46
00:08:25,782 --> 00:08:27,781
Line them up along the wall!

47
00:08:27,783 --> 00:08:29,151
Keep them quiet!

48
00:08:33,056 --> 00:08:34,555
<i>Children, stay close to me.</i>

49
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,750
Who are you?

50
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:05,756
The Lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.

51
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:08,555
Now, who are you?

52
00:09:08,557 --> 00:09:11,626
We're a small group
of reactionary terrorists.

53
00:09:11,628 --> 00:09:13,995
We know that sin has brought
on this plague of aliens.

54
00:09:13,997 --> 00:09:15,462
Why the hostages?

55
00:09:15,464 --> 00:09:18,065
You're too late.

56
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:20,034
The countdown's already begun.

57
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:24,872
In a few minutes, four city
blocks...

58
00:09:24,874 --> 00:09:26,676
While the world watches.

59
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,045
<i>Hush!</i>

60
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:32,146
Shut up!

61
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:34,449
This is man's best hope.

62
00:09:34,451 --> 00:09:36,851
Down with the modern world.

63
00:09:36,853 --> 00:09:41,421
Back to the Dark Ages,
and the safety of holy fear.

64
00:09:43,026 --> 00:09:44,227
<i>Quiet!</i>

65
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:24,501
This would've been
over quickly, but...

66
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:26,934
No! Don't!

67
00:10:49,057 --> 00:10:50,724
I don't believe it.

68
00:10:50,726 --> 00:10:51,858
What are you?

69
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,129
A believer.

70
00:11:30,265 --> 00:11:33,099
<i>I'm asking for your help.</i>

71
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:37,872
I believe there is a stranger who
comes to this village from the sea.

72
00:11:37,874 --> 00:11:41,444
He comes in the winter when the
people are hungry and brings fish.

73
00:11:42,946 --> 00:11:44,648
<i>He comes on the king tide.</i>

74
00:11:46,181 --> 00:11:47,383
That was last night.

75
00:11:51,988 --> 00:11:56,089
Icebergs in the harbor, four months
since the last ship got through.

76
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:59,929
Well, this stranger
doesn't come by ship.

77
00:12:01,464 --> 00:12:04,834
There are enemies coming
from far away.

78
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,334
I need warriors.

79
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:12,171
I'm building an alliance
to defend ourselves.

80
00:12:12,173 --> 00:12:15,776
Look, I'll give you $25,000
to talk to this man right now.

81
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:20,247
Outside.

82
00:12:39,234 --> 00:12:41,904
Tell me what those three boxes
are and I'll make it $30,000.

83
00:12:45,907 --> 00:12:47,540
You should get out.

84
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:49,022
Can you at least point me
to Atlantis?

85
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:53,450
Arthur Curry.

86
00:12:59,687 --> 00:13:02,324
Also known as
Protector of the Oceans.

87
00:13:02,892 --> 00:13:03,994
The Aquaman.

88
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:08,330
I hear you can talk to fish.

89
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,800
So let me get this straight.

90
00:13:12,802 --> 00:13:16,570
You do it dressed like a bat?
Like an actual bat?

91
00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:18,506
It's worked for 20 years
in Gotham.

92
00:13:18,508 --> 00:13:20,407
Oh, that shithole.

93
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:22,377
When the fight comes,
we'll need you.

94
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:24,178
- Don't count on it, Batman.
- Why not?

95
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,780
'Cause I don't like
you coming here,

96
00:13:25,782 --> 00:13:27,580
digging into my business
and getting into my life.

97
00:13:27,582 --> 00:13:29,317
People from Atlantis tell me,
"Do this."

98
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:30,784
Now you say, "Do that."

99
00:13:30,786 --> 00:13:32,519
- I wanna be left alone.
- Is that why you help

100
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,454
these people out here
in the middle of nowhere?

101
00:13:34,456 --> 00:13:36,089
'Cause you can just leave?

102
00:13:36,091 --> 00:13:38,593
I help them 'cause
no one else does.

103
00:13:38,595 --> 00:13:41,261
If you want to protect them,
you need to work with me.

104
00:13:41,263 --> 00:13:43,063
"Strong man is strongest alone."

105
00:13:43,065 --> 00:13:44,464
You ever heard that?

106
00:13:44,466 --> 00:13:45,998
That's not a saying.

107
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,102
That's the opposite
of what the saying is.

108
00:13:48,104 --> 00:13:49,837
Yeah.

109
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,308
<i>Doesn't mean I'm wrong.</i>

110
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,808
You ever hear of Superman?

111
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,809
He died fighting next to me.

112
00:13:55,811 --> 00:13:56,980
My point exactly.

113
00:13:59,315 --> 00:14:01,448
What's in the three boxes?

114
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,784
It's ancient history.

115
00:14:02,786 --> 00:14:03,984
What is it?

116
00:14:03,986 --> 00:14:05,553
Mankind's melting
the polar ice caps,

117
00:14:05,555 --> 00:14:07,854
destroying the ecosystem.
They got it coming?

118
00:14:07,856 --> 00:14:11,492
Hey, I don't mind
if the oceans rise.

119
00:14:11,494 --> 00:14:12,862
How about if they boil?

120
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:15,431
Dressed like a bat.

121
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:18,368
You're out of your mind,
Bruce Wayne.

122
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,109
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

123
00:14:34,148 --> 00:14:38,385
So you say you have no way of
reconnecting with this Aquaman?

124
00:14:38,387 --> 00:14:42,058
Oh, I put a tracking device in his
coat, but he left without it.

125
00:14:43,658 --> 00:14:45,662
May, in fact,
not have been his coat.

126
00:14:47,397 --> 00:14:50,098
Those squares
from Luthor's notes.

127
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,366
I think they must be
containers of some kind.

128
00:14:52,368 --> 00:14:53,733
Of what?

129
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:55,835
I don't know. Money. Power.

130
00:14:55,837 --> 00:14:59,140
Something worth starting
a war over.

131
00:14:59,142 --> 00:15:03,611
Well, we've had luck with one
person on the team list.

132
00:15:03,613 --> 00:15:06,814
Barry Allen of Central City.

133
00:15:06,816 --> 00:15:08,848
He's completely off the grid.

134
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,285
Squatting, I think.
Moves suddenly and often.

135
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:13,688
Disappearing act.

136
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,056
<i>But he does visit
his father.</i>

137
00:15:16,058 --> 00:15:18,925
In prison for murdering
his mother.

138
00:15:18,927 --> 00:15:20,694
Jesus.

139
00:15:20,696 --> 00:15:22,662
<i>Young Barry always
protested his father's innocence.</i>

140
00:15:22,664 --> 00:15:24,765
<i>But he was nine
and nobody listened to him.</i>

141
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:26,300
We have somebody at the prison?

142
00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:28,437
<i>Oh, yeah.
We'll find the address.</i>

143
00:15:29,337 --> 00:15:31,872
What about, uh, Diana?

144
00:15:31,874 --> 00:15:34,308
Well, you have her number.

145
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,876
What, you could've called her.

146
00:15:35,878 --> 00:15:40,080
Oh! Perhaps I should fly to
Paris with a handwritten note.

147
00:15:40,082 --> 00:15:43,784
"Will you be Bruce's teammate?
Check yes or no."

148
00:15:43,786 --> 00:15:45,987
I'm only interested
in her skill set.

149
00:15:45,989 --> 00:15:48,856
- I'm sure you are.
- Can we?

150
00:15:48,858 --> 00:15:52,425
Ah, well, facial recognition's
a bit dodgy on this one.

151
00:15:52,427 --> 00:15:54,361
But they've got a partial match.

152
00:15:54,363 --> 00:15:56,063
A Victor Stone.

153
00:15:56,065 --> 00:16:01,468
Genius IQ, football scholarship
to GCU, and deceased.

154
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,535
Figures.

155
00:16:02,537 --> 00:16:04,572
Fairy tales and ghost stories.

156
00:16:04,574 --> 00:16:09,510
One misses the days when one's biggest
concerns were exploding wind-up penguins.

157
00:16:09,512 --> 00:16:10,847
The simple life.

158
00:16:12,414 --> 00:16:15,282
I don't recognize this world.

159
00:16:15,284 --> 00:16:16,785
I don't have to recognize it.

160
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:19,789
I just have to save it.

161
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:28,963
Here to see Henry Allen.

162
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:30,162
Sign.

163
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,172
Hurry it up, will you?

164
00:16:39,608 --> 00:16:41,010
What, you got a problem?

165
00:16:41,978 --> 00:16:43,246
No, there's no problem.

166
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,514
Better not be.

167
00:16:50,786 --> 00:16:51,988
You know where to go.

168
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:04,164
Are those prescription?

169
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,069
Or are you just trying
to look brainy?

170
00:17:09,971 --> 00:17:12,305
Because you're holding
yourself back.

171
00:17:12,307 --> 00:17:13,908
You're going in circles.

172
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,009
You're working three dead-end
jobs, going on four.

173
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:17,612
Where do you even have the time?

174
00:17:17,614 --> 00:17:19,179
- I make the time.
- And this is all to pay

175
00:17:19,181 --> 00:17:20,980
for a criminal justice
degree, huh?

176
00:17:20,982 --> 00:17:23,449
Okay, I really don't wanna
talk about this again.

177
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:25,218
The investigation was botched.

178
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,221
Give me your hand, man.

179
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:36,231
I want you to listen to me,
Barry, because I mean this.

180
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,301
I want you to give all that up.

181
00:17:42,671 --> 00:17:45,642
And I want you to stop
coming to see me.

182
00:17:47,742 --> 00:17:50,779
I am a drag on your life.

183
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:55,117
Please don't ever say
that to me again.

184
00:17:55,985 --> 00:17:57,083
Please?

185
00:17:57,085 --> 00:17:58,584
You can be whatever
you want to be.

186
00:17:58,586 --> 00:17:59,922
You're brilliant, man.

187
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,426
Absolute best of the best.

188
00:18:05,428 --> 00:18:10,229
I can't sit here and watch you
run in place in Central City

189
00:18:10,231 --> 00:18:15,268
for some old dude
who is not going anywhere.

190
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,138
- Dad, that's not true.
<i>- It's time.</i>

191
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,605
- That's not true.
- Let's go, Allen. Allen!

192
00:18:19,607 --> 00:18:21,240
I want you to make
your own future.

193
00:18:21,242 --> 00:18:23,376
You're living in the past.
Make your own future.

194
00:18:23,378 --> 00:18:24,510
Open gate.

195
00:18:48,537 --> 00:18:49,806
Lab's all yours, Howard.

196
00:18:50,272 --> 00:18:51,372
11:30.

197
00:18:51,374 --> 00:18:53,740
Early night for you, Silas.

198
00:18:53,742 --> 00:18:55,345
Yes. Early.

199
00:18:56,812 --> 00:18:58,381
I never got to say...

200
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:02,852
I'm very sorry
about what happened.

201
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,254
Victor was a wonderful kid.

202
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:08,991
Thank you.

203
00:19:20,435 --> 00:19:21,637
Victor.

204
00:19:22,738 --> 00:19:24,641
Victor, you're not stuck
up here.

205
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,646
You can have a life.
You can have more than...

206
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,614
If you stay up here brooding...

207
00:19:34,616 --> 00:19:36,315
I'm processing.

208
00:19:36,317 --> 00:19:38,818
I can access everything.

209
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,720
But I can't put it all together.

210
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:43,756
Not yet. But if you worked with me,
if we had the change engine...

211
00:19:43,758 --> 00:19:46,729
So you'd do to someone
else what you did to me?

212
00:19:47,762 --> 00:19:49,062
No.

213
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:51,064
The box stays hidden.

214
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:53,132
If you could see
what we're learning

215
00:19:53,134 --> 00:19:56,937
from the Kryptonian ship... I think the change
engine could integrate with its energy,

216
00:19:56,939 --> 00:19:59,099
- get it powered up and...
- Does anybody know?

217
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:02,141
- What?
- At the lab.

218
00:20:02,143 --> 00:20:03,910
Does anybody know I'm alive?

219
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:06,545
I...

220
00:20:06,547 --> 00:20:08,215
didn't think you were ready
for them to...

221
00:20:08,217 --> 00:20:09,083
To what?

222
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:10,787
For them to see the monster?

223
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,287
You are not a monster.

224
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:16,758
It's weird that you thought
I meant me.

225
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,263
What I did...

226
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:26,632
I lost your mother
in that accident.

227
00:20:26,634 --> 00:20:27,869
I wasn't about to...

228
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:31,705
I couldn't bear to lose my son.

229
00:20:31,707 --> 00:20:34,006
But you did.

230
00:20:34,008 --> 00:20:38,211
I got a language in my head
that I don't speak.

231
00:20:38,213 --> 00:20:41,680
It's not just digital.
It's alien.

232
00:20:41,682 --> 00:20:44,052
Every day, I wake up different.

233
00:20:46,255 --> 00:20:47,290
Modified.

234
00:20:48,891 --> 00:20:50,093
How do you...

235
00:20:56,332 --> 00:20:57,900
Couldn't do that last night.

236
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,401
Ever since we got visitors
from Krypton,

237
00:21:01,403 --> 00:21:04,006
people have been waiting
for the next alien invasion.

238
00:21:06,776 --> 00:21:08,244
Now I gotta wonder if I'm it.

239
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:26,519
Any changes today?

240
00:22:26,521 --> 00:22:27,956
No, my Queen.

241
00:22:29,423 --> 00:22:33,326
The Mother Box has awoken,
yet nothing has happened.

242
00:22:33,328 --> 00:22:37,066
It has slept for thousands of
years, since the First Age.

243
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,166
Why did it wake at all?

244
00:22:48,376 --> 00:22:50,980
Amazons! On your mark!

245
00:22:57,219 --> 00:23:00,286
Yes, soldiers! Fight on!

246
00:23:00,288 --> 00:23:01,523
Ready!

247
00:23:14,403 --> 00:23:15,938
Steppenwolf.

248
00:23:18,908 --> 00:23:20,673
<i>Mother.</i>

249
00:23:20,675 --> 00:23:24,246
Millennia in exile, searching...

250
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:28,114
At last you call me home.

251
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:30,784
You will not like
your welcome.

252
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:33,154
Oh, I think I will.

253
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:39,666
Steady!

254
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:44,430
Forward!

255
00:23:56,577 --> 00:23:58,010
Gather the legions!

256
00:23:58,012 --> 00:23:59,712
You must seal the cage!

257
00:23:59,714 --> 00:24:01,281
Go!

258
00:24:01,283 --> 00:24:02,618
Flank right!

259
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,126
Yes.

260
00:24:10,726 --> 00:24:11,891
Run.

261
00:24:11,893 --> 00:24:13,794
Seal the gates!

262
00:24:36,485 --> 00:24:37,485
Keep it moving.

263
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:43,418
Got it! Go!

264
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,593
Enough.

265
00:26:02,805 --> 00:26:06,605
Noble Queen, why do you fight?

266
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:10,642
After the unity,
you will join my legion

267
00:26:10,644 --> 00:26:14,616
and you will know
the righteousness of power.

268
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,688
You will love me.

269
00:26:29,998 --> 00:26:31,566
You all will.

270
00:26:57,192 --> 00:26:59,758
We have to light the ancient
warning fire.

271
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,330
The fire has not burned
for 5,000 years.

272
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:05,434
Men won't know what it means.

273
00:27:06,201 --> 00:27:07,403
Men won't.

274
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:10,506
She will.

275
00:27:23,218 --> 00:27:24,854
Listen to me, Diana.

276
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,974
What did you
do this weekend, Diana?

277
00:27:47,976 --> 00:27:49,475
- Me?
- Yeah.

278
00:27:49,477 --> 00:27:51,443
Nothing very interesting.

279
00:27:51,445 --> 00:27:54,514
That's all you ever tell us.

280
00:27:54,516 --> 00:27:56,815
What can I say,
I'm not that exciting.

281
00:27:56,817 --> 00:27:58,951
<i>...so-called
shrine of the Amazons,</i>

282
00:27:58,953 --> 00:28:02,721
<i>an enormous bonfire burned
right behind me,</i>

283
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:08,327
<i>baffling absolutely everyone from
locals to government authorities alike.</i>

284
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:11,198
<i>The fire could be seen
for miles on end.</i>

285
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,499
Invasion.

286
00:28:13,501 --> 00:28:17,504
<i>On the local scene, this janitor's
wife had some strong words</i>

287
00:28:17,506 --> 00:28:21,208
<i>for the aliens she says
stole her man.</i>

288
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:25,378
<i>My Howard is a good man.
He's a provider.</i>

289
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,248
<i>And these aliens
are gonna... probe him?</i>

290
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:34,587
<i>Come down to the Lakeview, and I'll stick
a... probe up your alien... you...</i>

291
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:37,990
I found a little
place. By the diner.

292
00:28:37,992 --> 00:28:39,426
Suits me just fine.

293
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:40,892
I wish
you'd said something.

294
00:28:40,894 --> 00:28:43,162
Oh, no.
I got behind in the payments.

295
00:28:43,164 --> 00:28:46,902
And you know the banks jump like
a cougar if you miss by a dime.

296
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:49,869
Place was too big
for me, anyway.

297
00:28:49,871 --> 00:28:52,037
Shuffling around
like an old ghost.

298
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:55,475
Well, I might've been able
to talk to someone, or...

299
00:28:55,477 --> 00:28:57,009
You had enough to deal with.

300
00:28:57,011 --> 00:28:58,811
Don't need to add
"mother-in-law" to the list.

301
00:29:00,214 --> 00:29:01,479
Not that I was ever...

302
00:29:01,481 --> 00:29:02,916
<i>Hey, Lane.</i>

303
00:29:02,918 --> 00:29:08,020
Who was your source,
the activist in that university?

304
00:29:08,022 --> 00:29:09,488
Well, it's my source.

305
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:12,359
<i>I got tapped
for the kidnapping story.</i>

306
00:29:12,361 --> 00:29:14,093
There were all
those student protests.

307
00:29:14,095 --> 00:29:15,562
Anyway, I'm thinking
it's political.

308
00:29:15,564 --> 00:29:17,630
<i>So, who's your guy?</i>

309
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:19,565
Well, I'll see
if she'll take your call.

310
00:29:19,567 --> 00:29:23,338
So it's a she. Hmm.

311
00:29:24,873 --> 00:29:25,874
It's not a she.

312
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:29,278
Sounds like you should be
working that story.

313
00:29:30,345 --> 00:29:31,547
I'm...

314
00:29:32,547 --> 00:29:34,448
I'm not ready yet.

315
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,682
I'm perfectly happy
doing fluff pieces

316
00:29:36,684 --> 00:29:38,386
about kitten grooming.

317
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:40,355
For a while.

318
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:44,360
It was hard coming back
here at all.

319
00:29:45,626 --> 00:29:47,996
Well, I can hardly read
the news, anyway.

320
00:29:48,896 --> 00:29:50,964
So much bitterness.

321
00:29:50,966 --> 00:29:53,002
Of course I think it's all
because he's gone.

322
00:29:55,237 --> 00:29:56,839
But I suppose a mother does.

323
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,007
But it's not like there's any
less that needs reporting.

324
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:05,144
And Clark promised me you were
gonna bring home another Pulitzer.

325
00:30:05,146 --> 00:30:07,314
- Oh, did he?
- Oh, yes. He did.

326
00:30:07,316 --> 00:30:10,950
He said that you were the thirstiest
young woman that he'd ever met.

327
00:30:13,253 --> 00:30:14,621
Hungriest.

328
00:30:14,623 --> 00:30:17,724
Hungriest... Yeah.

329
00:30:17,726 --> 00:30:22,031
He said you could smell a story
further away than he could hear.

330
00:30:24,266 --> 00:30:27,903
Well, stories just made sense.

331
00:30:29,104 --> 00:30:30,503
It was more than just a puzzle.

332
00:30:30,505 --> 00:30:33,006
It was about the truth.

333
00:30:33,008 --> 00:30:36,979
It was about seeing the engine
of the world.

334
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,314
When it still ran.

335
00:30:47,422 --> 00:30:50,592
<i>Victor Stone. Deceased.</i>

336
00:31:33,168 --> 00:31:34,868
That one.

337
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,137
Pretty sure that's what made
the alien go crazy.

338
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:39,572
<i>I'll see about rigging
something for the suit.</i>

339
00:31:39,574 --> 00:31:40,707
<i>Won't be quick.</i>

340
00:31:40,709 --> 00:31:42,029
Anything that can
give me an edge.

341
00:31:54,322 --> 00:31:57,791
You know, I paid millions of dollars
for this building's security.

342
00:31:57,793 --> 00:31:59,561
Yeah, it looked expensive.

343
00:32:04,164 --> 00:32:05,166
Hi.

344
00:32:06,567 --> 00:32:08,167
A new toy?

345
00:32:08,169 --> 00:32:10,836
Prototype troop carrier.

346
00:32:10,838 --> 00:32:13,575
I once knew a man
who would have loved to fly it.

347
00:32:14,209 --> 00:32:15,574
Yeah.

348
00:32:15,576 --> 00:32:17,512
We're gonna need
more than a pilot.

349
00:32:18,546 --> 00:32:20,346
I think
there's an attack coming.

350
00:32:20,348 --> 00:32:21,682
Not coming, Bruce.

351
00:32:22,451 --> 00:32:23,786
It's already here.

352
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:31,026
<i>They called him
Steppenwolf, the end of worlds.</i>

353
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,126
<i>He lived only to conquer.</i>

354
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:40,533
<i>Millions fell before his blade,
or rose again as his Parademons.</i>

355
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:44,571
<i>Nightmare creatures
who feed on fear.</i>

356
00:32:46,306 --> 00:32:47,907
Yeah, I think I met one.

357
00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:49,542
We didn't hit it off.

358
00:32:49,544 --> 00:32:51,311
Here in Gotham?

359
00:32:51,313 --> 00:32:54,814
They're all over.
They're looking for his boxes?

360
00:32:54,816 --> 00:32:56,381
The Mother Boxes.

361
00:32:56,383 --> 00:32:57,917
Mother Boxes.

362
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,119
I guess Steppenwolf took the one
your people were guarding.

363
00:33:00,121 --> 00:33:01,653
That leaves two more.

364
00:33:01,655 --> 00:33:03,156
I'm impressed.

365
00:33:03,158 --> 00:33:05,458
Don't be.
I have no idea what's in them.

366
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,259
A weapon? Some kind of power?

367
00:33:07,261 --> 00:33:08,763
They don't contain power.

368
00:33:10,431 --> 00:33:11,933
They are power.

369
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:15,767
<i>Carried from planet
to planet,</i>

370
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:19,139
<i>the Mother Boxes combine
to form the unity.</i>

371
00:33:19,141 --> 00:33:22,741
<i>An apocalyptic power
that not only destroys worlds,</i>

372
00:33:22,743 --> 00:33:28,483
<i>but transforms them into the primordial
hellscape of Steppenwolf's birth world.</i>

373
00:33:29,817 --> 00:33:31,717
<i>We should have died.</i>

374
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:34,387
<i>But we formed our own unity.</i>

375
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:41,294
<i>Amazons, Atlanteans, all the
tribes of men fought side by side.</i>

376
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:45,198
<i>Warriors of legend...</i>

377
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,605
<i>...allies from other worlds,</i>

378
00:33:52,306 --> 00:33:56,442
<i>even the gods themselves
all acted as one,</i>

379
00:33:56,444 --> 00:33:59,780
<i>laying down their lives
to drive Steppenwolf away.</i>

380
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:13,793
<i>Some say it drove him mad.</i>

381
00:34:13,795 --> 00:34:16,662
<i>The disgrace
of his first retreat.</i>

382
00:34:16,664 --> 00:34:18,867
<i>He swore our alliance
would crumble.</i>

383
00:34:20,367 --> 00:34:22,769
<i>That darkness would cover
the Earth.</i>

384
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,277
<i>And that he would return
when it did.</i>

385
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,546
<i>Left behind,</i>

386
00:34:34,548 --> 00:34:37,184
<i>the Mother Boxes were too
dangerous to be kept together.</i>

387
00:34:39,787 --> 00:34:42,056
<i>One was entrusted
to the Amazons.</i>

388
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,758
<i>One to the Atlanteans.</i>

389
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,565
<i>Both sealed and guarded
in secure strongholds.</i>

390
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:54,668
<i>The Box of Men
was buried in secret,</i>

391
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:59,007
<i>so that no tribe would be tempted
to use its power over another.</i>

392
00:35:03,445 --> 00:35:05,978
Such harmony out of such horror.

393
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,680
It was truly an Age of Heroes.

394
00:35:08,682 --> 00:35:12,052
Something tells me we're not
getting the band back together.

395
00:35:12,054 --> 00:35:14,287
The Atlanteans
were forced undersea,

396
00:35:14,289 --> 00:35:17,423
and the Amazons to an island
they can never leave.

397
00:35:17,425 --> 00:35:20,325
Well, I wouldn't count
on the tribes of men.

398
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:23,264
We tend to act like the Doomsday
Clock has a snooze button.

399
00:35:24,432 --> 00:35:25,934
- How long until...
- Days.

400
00:35:26,934 --> 00:35:28,967
At most.

401
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:31,637
Steppenwolf's mistake last time
was attacking us.

402
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:34,405
He wanted to make the Earth
kneel before he destroyed us.

403
00:35:35,844 --> 00:35:38,276
This time he'll just go
after the boxes.

404
00:35:38,278 --> 00:35:40,579
I got a location
for one of our recruits.

405
00:35:40,581 --> 00:35:41,813
Barry Allen.

406
00:35:41,815 --> 00:35:44,115
What about the other one?
Victor Stone?

407
00:35:44,117 --> 00:35:45,653
I was hoping
you would dig him up.

408
00:35:48,923 --> 00:35:51,423
We're asking people we don't
know to risk their lives.

409
00:35:51,425 --> 00:35:52,661
I know.

410
00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:55,097
That's how this works.

411
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,496
Barry Allen, Bruce Wayne.

412
00:36:30,498 --> 00:36:34,900
You said that like it explains why
there's a total stranger in my place,

413
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:37,405
sitting in the dark,
in my second favorite chair.

414
00:36:38,438 --> 00:36:39,440
Tell me about this.

415
00:36:43,978 --> 00:36:48,749
This is a person who looks exactly
like me, but who is definitely not me.

416
00:36:49,851 --> 00:36:52,684
Very attractive Jewish boy.

417
00:36:52,686 --> 00:36:55,787
Somebody who, I don't know,
stole your pocket watch?

418
00:36:55,789 --> 00:36:58,490
Or railroads?

419
00:36:58,492 --> 00:37:00,059
I know you have abilities.

420
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:02,295
I just don't know what they are.

421
00:37:02,297 --> 00:37:07,999
My special skills include viola, web
design, fluent in sign language...

422
00:37:08,001 --> 00:37:09,802
Gorilla sign language.

423
00:37:09,804 --> 00:37:13,773
Silica-based quartz sand fabric,
abrasion resistant, heat resistant...

424
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:15,941
Yeah, I do competitive
ice dancing.

425
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:17,443
It's what they use
on the space shuttle

426
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:19,345
to prevent it from burning up
on reentry.

427
00:37:19,347 --> 00:37:23,449
I do very competitive
ice dancing.

428
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:26,353
Whoever you're looking for,
it's not me.

429
00:37:50,744 --> 00:37:52,478
You're the Batman?

430
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,280
So, you're fast.

431
00:37:54,282 --> 00:37:56,215
That feels like
an oversimplification.

432
00:37:56,217 --> 00:37:59,851
I'm putting together a team.
People with special abilities.

433
00:37:59,853 --> 00:38:01,619
You see,
I believe enemies are coming.

434
00:38:01,621 --> 00:38:03,988
Stop right there. I'm in.

435
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,392
- You are?
- Yeah.

436
00:38:06,394 --> 00:38:07,963
I need friends.

437
00:38:09,262 --> 00:38:12,831
People are difficult.
They require a lot of focus.

438
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,967
They, uh...
They have, like, a rhythm

439
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:17,168
that I haven't quite
been able to...

440
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,706
Like brunch!
Like, what is brunch?

441
00:38:20,708 --> 00:38:24,211
You wait in line for an hour
for, essentially, lunch.

442
00:38:24,713 --> 00:38:25,914
I mean...

443
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,646
I don't know.

444
00:38:28,648 --> 00:38:31,286
People are a little slow.

445
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:33,554
I'll try to keep up.

446
00:38:34,322 --> 00:38:36,621
Can I keep this?

447
00:38:36,623 --> 00:38:39,124
It's like this layer
of dimensional reality,

448
00:38:39,126 --> 00:38:40,626
and it seems to manipulate
space-time.

449
00:38:40,628 --> 00:38:42,160
I call it the Speed Force.

450
00:38:42,162 --> 00:38:44,030
Causes me to burn a tremendous
amount of calories.

451
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:46,865
So I'm just a black hole
of snacks.

452
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:49,369
I am a "snack" hole.

453
00:38:49,371 --> 00:38:52,637
How many people
are on this special fight team?

454
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:53,972
Three, including you.

455
00:38:53,974 --> 00:38:55,576
Three? Against what?

456
00:38:56,777 --> 00:38:57,979
I'll tell you on the plane.

457
00:38:58,579 --> 00:38:59,815
The plane?

458
00:39:00,715 --> 00:39:02,350
What are your superpowers again?

459
00:39:03,316 --> 00:39:04,318
I'm rich.

460
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:31,912
The program always gets
twitchy with this footage.

461
00:39:42,657 --> 00:39:43,925
You know who we are.

462
00:39:49,028 --> 00:39:50,532
Are you Victor Stone?

463
00:39:55,903 --> 00:39:57,338
I need to speak to you.

464
00:39:59,507 --> 00:40:01,106
No. Face-to-face.

465
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:02,611
I'm old-fashioned that way.

466
00:40:05,813 --> 00:40:09,884
If I was going to attack you, I
would have done it by the lake.

467
00:40:13,253 --> 00:40:15,123
Looks like you have a date,
Ms. Prince.

468
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:18,593
<i>About time somebody here did.</i>

469
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:54,226
Face-to-face.

470
00:40:54,228 --> 00:40:55,931
I've been doing some tracking.

471
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,700
What you're looking for
is sticking to the dead zones.

472
00:41:01,702 --> 00:41:05,403
If it gets in front of a camera,
causes a surge,

473
00:41:05,405 --> 00:41:07,874
- I'll let you know.
- That's not good enough.

474
00:41:07,876 --> 00:41:09,077
Not good enough?

475
00:41:09,644 --> 00:41:11,642
<i>For you.</i>

476
00:41:11,644 --> 00:41:15,682
Look, I don't know you, and I don't
know how you got these gifts.

477
00:41:15,684 --> 00:41:16,782
Gifts?

478
00:41:16,784 --> 00:41:18,450
No one else can do what you do.

479
00:41:18,452 --> 00:41:24,055
No. If these are gifts, then why
am I the one paying for them?

480
00:41:24,057 --> 00:41:25,393
We need you, Victor.

481
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:29,528
And maybe you need us.

482
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,063
I do fine alone.

483
00:41:31,065 --> 00:41:33,601
I told myself the same
for a long time.

484
00:41:38,972 --> 00:41:41,308
I lost someone I loved once.

485
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,414
I shut myself off from...

486
00:41:47,715 --> 00:41:49,548
From everyone.

487
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:52,253
But I had to learn to open
back up again.

488
00:41:54,621 --> 00:41:57,856
The truth is,
I'm still working on it.

489
00:41:57,858 --> 00:42:00,161
And if you agreed to meet me,

490
00:42:02,429 --> 00:42:04,264
you're working on it, too.

491
00:42:06,032 --> 00:42:07,335
Trust me, Victor.

492
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,712
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

493
00:42:19,213 --> 00:42:21,514
<i>Something came down
from the sky!</i>

494
00:42:21,516 --> 00:42:22,947
<i>Cortlandt, you're cutting out.</i>

495
00:42:22,949 --> 00:42:24,218
<i>Please help me!</i>

496
00:42:46,807 --> 00:42:48,307
Whiskey.

497
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:50,275
And one for Ahab, there.

498
00:42:50,277 --> 00:42:52,545
From the sky.

499
00:42:52,547 --> 00:42:54,613
I heard a cannon.

500
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:56,751
- To ocean's rage.
- And they came.

501
00:42:57,918 --> 00:43:00,822
Monsters from the sky.

502
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:04,559
Tore right through my boat.

503
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,062
Monsters.

504
00:43:08,929 --> 00:43:10,164
It's on him.

505
00:45:35,309 --> 00:45:36,678
You took a hell of a hit.

506
00:45:37,344 --> 00:45:38,546
You all right?

507
00:45:39,045 --> 00:45:40,378
At last.

508
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,951
The firstborn of beloved
Queen Atlanna.

509
00:45:44,918 --> 00:45:45,920
Wait.

510
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:49,324
Please.

511
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:53,360
I knew her.

512
00:45:55,228 --> 00:45:56,896
Well, that makes one of us.

513
00:45:56,898 --> 00:46:01,032
When my parents fought in
the wars, she took me in.

514
00:46:01,034 --> 00:46:02,400
What a saint.

515
00:46:02,402 --> 00:46:03,901
You dare speak
of Queen Atlanna that way?

516
00:46:03,903 --> 00:46:06,204
Your Queen left me
on my father's doorstep

517
00:46:06,206 --> 00:46:07,539
and never gave me
another thought.

518
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:09,807
Your mother left you
to save your life.

519
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:12,311
You cannot imagine
how it hurt her.

520
00:46:12,313 --> 00:46:13,780
What it cost her.

521
00:46:15,615 --> 00:46:17,918
But you're not a defenseless
child now.

522
00:46:19,387 --> 00:46:20,952
It would have been
her responsibility

523
00:46:20,954 --> 00:46:24,025
to follow that monster
to the surface and stop it.

524
00:46:25,525 --> 00:46:28,962
Now, it's yours.

525
00:46:30,831 --> 00:46:32,700
Then I'm gonna need
something from you.

526
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,195
<i>I see, Mother.</i>

527
00:47:36,197 --> 00:47:40,398
<i>I see why you waited
to summon me.</i>

528
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,970
<i>The Kryptonian's death plunged
this timid world into such terror.</i>

529
00:47:45,972 --> 00:47:52,112
Amazons, Atlanteans,
each stands and falls alone.

530
00:47:56,016 --> 00:48:00,217
I know, Mother, you've waited
too long for the unity.

531
00:48:00,219 --> 00:48:02,823
I know. But you will feed.

532
00:48:05,826 --> 00:48:09,728
And my exile will come
to an end.

533
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:13,434
I will take my place among
the New Gods.

534
00:48:14,702 --> 00:48:16,904
Find the last one!

535
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:21,476
Its power will cleanse
this world.

536
00:48:23,143 --> 00:48:24,945
For the unity!

537
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,981
For Darkseid.

538
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:38,892
Oh, Victor.

539
00:48:49,603 --> 00:48:51,235
Asshole!

540
00:48:51,237 --> 00:48:54,173
Eight kidnappings.
Six in Metropolis, two here.

541
00:48:54,175 --> 00:48:56,077
All the vics work for STAR Labs.

542
00:48:58,478 --> 00:49:01,546
"Attacked by a flying vampire."

543
00:49:01,548 --> 00:49:05,483
"Suspect was a giant bat
with huge fangs."

544
00:49:05,485 --> 00:49:07,119
One of them was a little kid.

545
00:49:07,121 --> 00:49:09,921
Scared. Won't say a word
but drew this. Looks like...

546
00:49:09,923 --> 00:49:12,157
I know what it looks like.

547
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:14,525
Come on, you think he fights
criminals for 20 years here,

548
00:49:14,527 --> 00:49:17,431
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

549
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:20,699
I'll talk to him tonight.

550
00:49:20,701 --> 00:49:22,767
World's gone crazy, Jim.

551
00:49:22,769 --> 00:49:24,204
Maybe he did, too.

552
00:49:28,809 --> 00:49:30,111
Did you find the cyborg?

553
00:49:31,478 --> 00:49:32,712
We spoke.

554
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:34,582
Give him time.

555
00:49:35,548 --> 00:49:37,715
You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

556
00:49:37,717 --> 00:49:39,351
Hi, Barry, I'm Diana.

557
00:49:39,353 --> 00:49:41,153
That's not right. Great.

558
00:49:41,155 --> 00:49:44,122
- So this is us?
- Yeah, this is us.

559
00:49:44,124 --> 00:49:46,191
Oh! Awesome!

560
00:49:46,193 --> 00:49:48,659
That's the Bat-Signal!
That's your... Oh, sh...

561
00:49:48,661 --> 00:49:50,394
Sorry.
That's your signal.

562
00:49:50,396 --> 00:49:51,796
That means we have to go now.

563
00:49:51,798 --> 00:49:53,499
Yeah, that's what that means.

564
00:49:53,501 --> 00:49:54,769
It's so cool.

565
00:50:30,469 --> 00:50:32,537
How many of you are there?

566
00:50:32,539 --> 00:50:35,072
Not enough.

567
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:38,075
Eight people abducted
from or near STAR Labs.

568
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:39,713
Here's the potential perp.

569
00:50:40,514 --> 00:50:42,180
Parademons.

570
00:50:42,182 --> 00:50:43,615
Okay.

571
00:50:43,617 --> 00:50:45,550
The demons must have caught
the scent of the Mother Box.

572
00:50:45,552 --> 00:50:48,287
They carried people away
to find out what they know.

573
00:50:48,289 --> 00:50:49,720
So the eight may still be alive.

574
00:50:49,722 --> 00:50:51,258
Nine.

575
00:50:53,594 --> 00:50:55,963
The head of STAR Labs
was taken as well.

576
00:50:56,896 --> 00:50:58,132
You made it.

577
00:50:59,934 --> 00:51:02,967
So then, there must be
a nest nearby.

578
00:51:02,969 --> 00:51:06,436
I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.

579
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,805
No pattern I can see.

580
00:51:07,807 --> 00:51:09,541
The lines on the map
don't converge.

581
00:51:09,543 --> 00:51:11,175
On land.

582
00:51:11,177 --> 00:51:13,577
These lead back to Braxton
Island between the two cities.

583
00:51:13,579 --> 00:51:14,813
Gotham Harbor.

584
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,881
These are air vents.

585
00:51:16,883 --> 00:51:20,123
They all lead down to the tunnel for
Metropolis Project that was abandoned in '29.

586
00:51:22,889 --> 00:51:24,190
Do you really think that...

587
00:51:25,826 --> 00:51:29,126
Oh, wow. They just...
They really just vanish.

588
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:30,628
Huh? Oh.

589
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:31,831
That's rude.

590
00:51:58,858 --> 00:52:00,925
- Where are we, Alfred?
- <i>Braxton Island.</i>

591
00:52:00,927 --> 00:52:05,997
You should be directly under the
venting tower for the tunnel.

592
00:52:05,999 --> 00:52:09,001
<i>Now look to your left,
you should see a staircase.</i>

593
00:52:09,003 --> 00:52:10,972
<i>It'll give you access
to the machine room.</i>

594
00:52:17,244 --> 00:52:19,644
Define "access."

595
00:52:19,646 --> 00:52:24,184
One at a time.
The bridge may not hold.

596
00:52:29,222 --> 00:52:31,789
<i>Just tell me the truth.</i>

597
00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:34,392
<i>Please, just let us go.
I have a family.</i>

598
00:52:34,394 --> 00:52:35,760
<i>Wrong answer.</i>

599
00:52:36,996 --> 00:52:38,729
<i>Humans.</i>

600
00:52:38,731 --> 00:52:42,834
<i>The stench of your fear
is making my soldiers hungry.</i>

601
00:52:42,836 --> 00:52:45,206
Shall I feed them?

602
00:52:46,505 --> 00:52:48,639
You've been near the Mother Box.

603
00:52:48,641 --> 00:52:50,008
Her scent is on you.

604
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:52,677
Please. We have families.

605
00:52:52,679 --> 00:52:55,046
Why does everyone keep
telling me that?

606
00:52:55,048 --> 00:52:56,548
<i>Please, please.</i>

607
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:59,416
<i>I don't need to hurt you...</i>

608
00:52:59,418 --> 00:53:02,119
Right. Okay. Yeah.
Here's the thing. Um...

609
00:53:02,121 --> 00:53:07,758
See, I'm afraid of bugs and, um,
guns, and obnoxiously tall people.

610
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,427
And murder. And I can't be here.

611
00:53:11,231 --> 00:53:13,530
It's really cool you guys seem
ready to do battle and stuff,

612
00:53:13,532 --> 00:53:16,267
but, full transparency,
I've never done battle.

613
00:53:16,269 --> 00:53:18,839
I've just pushed some people
and run away.

614
00:53:19,373 --> 00:53:20,805
Save one.

615
00:53:20,807 --> 00:53:23,675
- What?
- Save one person.

616
00:53:23,677 --> 00:53:25,943
Uh... Which one?

617
00:53:25,945 --> 00:53:29,215
Don't talk, don't fight.
Get in, get one out.

618
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:31,316
And then?

619
00:53:31,318 --> 00:53:32,319
You'll know.

620
00:53:34,487 --> 00:53:35,586
Okay.

621
00:53:37,389 --> 00:53:38,826
Useless.

622
00:53:40,661 --> 00:53:41,929
You then.

623
00:53:43,931 --> 00:53:47,101
Where is my Mother Box?

624
00:53:48,268 --> 00:53:50,568
I'll die before I tell you.

625
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:54,041
At last, one that doesn't whine.

626
00:53:56,809 --> 00:53:58,878
But you will scream.

627
00:54:03,717 --> 00:54:05,249
Dad.

628
00:54:05,251 --> 00:54:06,617
Victor.

629
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:10,822
Ah, you were born of her.

630
00:54:10,824 --> 00:54:13,425
A creature of chaos.

631
00:54:13,427 --> 00:54:14,693
Not how I see it.

632
00:54:14,695 --> 00:54:16,430
Give it time.

633
00:54:17,297 --> 00:54:18,396
Ahh!

634
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:31,478
Amazon!

635
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:41,521
Okay.

636
00:54:42,556 --> 00:54:44,157
Save one. Save one.

637
00:54:54,601 --> 00:54:56,403
This one is mine.

638
00:54:58,103 --> 00:55:00,271
You overestimate yourself.

639
00:55:00,273 --> 00:55:02,072
Child,

640
00:55:02,074 --> 00:55:06,212
my ax is still slick
with the blood of your sisters.

641
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:22,561
Alfred, I need the Nightcrawler.

642
00:55:22,563 --> 00:55:24,396
Thought you'd never ask.

643
00:55:24,398 --> 00:55:26,901
Crawler's on the way.
Initiating remote mode.

644
00:55:40,313 --> 00:55:42,213
- Okay, you good?
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

645
00:55:42,215 --> 00:55:44,682
At the end of the hall,
there should be stairs. Go!

646
00:55:44,684 --> 00:55:46,985
He's after the change engine.
His Mother Box.

647
00:55:46,987 --> 00:55:48,353
You have to keep him from it.

648
00:55:48,355 --> 00:55:49,720
- Help people get to safety.
- Promise me!

649
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:50,925
Go!

650
00:56:26,659 --> 00:56:27,862
Finish her!

651
00:56:32,231 --> 00:56:33,566
Sorry, guys.

652
00:56:34,934 --> 00:56:36,834
I didn't bring a sword.

653
00:56:49,849 --> 00:56:52,385
Jesus. He is tall.

654
00:57:37,563 --> 00:57:38,632
Oh, fuck.

655
00:57:51,711 --> 00:57:52,713
Uh...

656
00:58:02,554 --> 00:58:06,693
So, you have the blood
of the Old Gods in you.

657
00:58:12,666 --> 00:58:14,601
The Old Gods died.

658
00:58:23,742 --> 00:58:25,943
No!

659
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:44,631
Heads up.

660
00:58:55,441 --> 00:58:58,309
Thanks, Alfred,
but I'll take it from here.

661
00:58:58,311 --> 00:59:00,246
Uh, do I know you?

662
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:19,766
Primitive beings.

663
00:59:25,204 --> 00:59:26,505
What are we under right now?

664
00:59:29,576 --> 00:59:30,644
Gotham Harbor.

665
00:59:34,347 --> 00:59:35,646
You all need to move.

666
00:59:35,648 --> 00:59:36,613
You get him out.

667
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:37,883
Diana, there's no time.

668
00:59:37,885 --> 00:59:40,184
Also among my fears is drowning.

669
00:59:40,186 --> 00:59:42,189
You are a distraction.

670
00:59:42,956 --> 00:59:44,557
Mother is calling.

671
00:59:48,994 --> 00:59:50,329
<i>Diana, come on!</i>

672
01:00:20,961 --> 01:00:22,463
Oh, come on.

673
01:00:26,499 --> 01:00:27,501
Whoa!

674
01:00:42,349 --> 01:00:43,749
The change engine.

675
01:00:49,155 --> 01:00:51,655
Did he just bail?

676
01:00:51,657 --> 01:00:54,025
Millions in structural damage.

677
01:00:54,027 --> 01:00:55,760
You haven't lost your touch.

678
01:00:55,762 --> 01:00:58,265
But it's good to see you
playing well with others.

679
01:01:02,268 --> 01:01:03,470
Dressed like a bat.

680
01:01:04,204 --> 01:01:05,439
I dig it.

681
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:08,173
May be temporary.

682
01:01:08,175 --> 01:01:11,275
So, what made you change
your mind?

683
01:01:11,277 --> 01:01:13,378
Steppenwolf.

684
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:15,412
He took the Mother Box
from Atlantis.

685
01:01:15,414 --> 01:01:18,048
All he needs now
is the lost Box of Men.

686
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:19,385
If he doesn't already have it.

687
01:01:22,521 --> 01:01:23,757
He doesn't have it.

688
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:13,873
Wow! It's like a cave.

689
01:02:16,842 --> 01:02:18,611
Like a bat cave.

690
01:02:22,815 --> 01:02:23,816
Barry.

691
01:02:25,418 --> 01:02:27,519
My father called it
a change engine.

692
01:02:27,521 --> 01:02:29,921
It was found by the British
during World War I.

693
01:02:29,923 --> 01:02:33,992
They studied it, but they couldn't
even date it, it's so old.

694
01:02:33,994 --> 01:02:37,695
It was shelved till
the night Superman died.

695
01:02:37,697 --> 01:02:39,997
Then she lit up like Christmas.

696
01:02:39,999 --> 01:02:44,802
They brought it to STAR Labs where my father
recognized it as a perpetual energy matrix.

697
01:02:44,804 --> 01:02:47,706
That sounds cool. I thought
it was like a nuclear bomb.

698
01:02:47,708 --> 01:02:50,909
A Mother Box destroys
as it creates.

699
01:02:50,911 --> 01:02:54,612
It's a cycle of life,
but a million times faster.

700
01:02:54,614 --> 01:02:56,983
My father thought it was the key
to unlimited energy.

701
01:02:57,883 --> 01:02:59,349
New formulas.

702
01:02:59,351 --> 01:03:01,184
Cellular regeneration.

703
01:03:01,186 --> 01:03:03,488
<i>But it's too volatile
to control.</i>

704
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:04,825
He used it on you.

705
01:03:05,624 --> 01:03:07,892
I was in an accident.

706
01:03:07,894 --> 01:03:09,894
<i>Should've died.</i>

707
01:03:09,896 --> 01:03:12,430
<i>My father thought that he
could use the Mother Box</i>

708
01:03:12,432 --> 01:03:13,865
<i>to rebuild the broken
parts of me</i>

709
01:03:13,867 --> 01:03:15,833
<i>with a few
cybernetic enhancements.</i>

710
01:03:15,835 --> 01:03:17,702
<i>Instead he built
a living machine</i>

711
01:03:17,704 --> 01:03:19,539
that may be stronger
than its host.

712
01:03:20,206 --> 01:03:21,408
<i>Too much.</i>

713
01:03:22,074 --> 01:03:23,409
Too much life.

714
01:03:24,309 --> 01:03:25,809
What's on your weird mind?

715
01:03:25,811 --> 01:03:30,814
Muscles, coordination,
basic cellular integrity.

716
01:03:30,816 --> 01:03:34,251
A human being can only
absorb so much.

717
01:03:34,253 --> 01:03:37,887
The Mother Box was designed
to reshape a planet.

718
01:03:37,889 --> 01:03:39,122
So?

719
01:03:39,124 --> 01:03:42,593
So, what if you were stronger
than a planet?

720
01:03:42,595 --> 01:03:47,130
Your cells lying dormant,
but incapable of decay.

721
01:03:47,132 --> 01:03:51,202
If you were in a conductive field,
a boost from the Mother Box...

722
01:03:51,204 --> 01:03:53,539
Could bring him back to life.

723
01:03:55,909 --> 01:03:58,409
The Kryptonian ship
has an amniotic chamber,

724
01:03:58,411 --> 01:04:00,445
- which would be a perfect...
- No.

725
01:04:00,447 --> 01:04:02,179
- <i>Diana...</i>
- Bruce, no.

726
01:04:02,181 --> 01:04:04,648
You have no idea what kind
of power you are dealing with.

727
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:06,282
Even if there's a fraction
of a chance?

728
01:04:06,284 --> 01:04:08,987
That what? That we could raise
a monster like Luthor did?

729
01:04:08,989 --> 01:04:10,822
We have tech Luthor's
never even seen.

730
01:04:10,824 --> 01:04:12,459
Superman is dead.

731
01:04:13,492 --> 01:04:14,892
We all wish he weren't.

732
01:04:14,894 --> 01:04:16,693
We don't know
what state he's in.

733
01:04:16,695 --> 01:04:18,695
We know we can't bring him back.

734
01:04:18,697 --> 01:04:21,398
But this is science
beyond our limits.

735
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,001
And that's what science is for.

736
01:04:23,003 --> 01:04:24,601
To do what's never been done.
To make life better.

737
01:04:24,603 --> 01:04:26,604
Or to end it.

738
01:04:26,606 --> 01:04:28,271
Technology is like
any other power.

739
01:04:28,273 --> 01:04:31,478
Without reason, without heart,
it destroys us.

740
01:04:32,711 --> 01:04:34,414
You're risking lives.

741
01:04:35,282 --> 01:04:36,914
Theirs and maybe countless more.

742
01:04:36,916 --> 01:04:39,150
We don't have time
for a control group.

743
01:04:39,152 --> 01:04:41,318
Is it a risk? Yes.
But it's necessary.

744
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,755
Why, because of your guilt?

745
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:47,324
Bruce, I was there.

746
01:04:47,326 --> 01:04:49,061
You didn't kill Superman.

747
01:04:50,664 --> 01:04:53,530
At some point, even you have
to learn to move on.

748
01:04:53,532 --> 01:04:55,601
Steve Trevor tell you that?

749
01:05:06,947 --> 01:05:11,117
Superman was a beacon
to the world.

750
01:05:12,552 --> 01:05:13,820
Why aren't you?

751
01:05:15,688 --> 01:05:17,688
<i>You're an inspiration, Diana.</i>

752
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:22,459
You don't just save people, you
make them see their better selves.

753
01:05:22,461 --> 01:05:27,430
And yet, I'd never heard of you until
Luthor lured you out by stealing

754
01:05:27,432 --> 01:05:28,969
a picture
of your dead boyfriend.

755
01:05:31,605 --> 01:05:34,204
You shut yourself down
for a century,

756
01:05:34,206 --> 01:05:37,775
so let's not talk about
me moving on.

757
01:05:37,777 --> 01:05:41,311
You know that if she kills
you, we'll cover for her.

758
01:05:41,313 --> 01:05:43,615
We are not enough!

759
01:05:43,617 --> 01:05:45,583
Each of us, in our own way,
is held back.

760
01:05:45,585 --> 01:05:47,885
And I promise you, Steppenwolf is
not out there talking about ethics.

761
01:05:47,887 --> 01:05:50,822
He's trying to burn
down the world!

762
01:05:50,824 --> 01:05:54,258
The way we're gonna stop him
is by using his power...

763
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:56,630
This power, against him.

764
01:05:58,164 --> 01:06:00,497
I agree.

765
01:06:00,499 --> 01:06:04,034
I don't like the idea of
reintegrating with the Mother Box,

766
01:06:04,036 --> 01:06:06,336
but I was running the numbers
while you were being an asshole,

767
01:06:06,338 --> 01:06:08,673
and there is a high probability
that we can bring him back.

768
01:06:08,675 --> 01:06:12,209
Right, right. But we mean bring him
back in like a, "Yay, he's back!" way,

769
01:06:12,211 --> 01:06:16,780
not in like
a <i>Pet Sematary</i> scenario.

770
01:06:16,782 --> 01:06:18,217
You lose something when you die.

771
01:06:19,251 --> 01:06:21,084
Even Superman.

772
01:06:21,086 --> 01:06:22,753
Maybe not his mind.

773
01:06:22,755 --> 01:06:24,588
Maybe his soul.

774
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:27,258
I'll have a contingency plan
for that.

775
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:31,865
If he wakes up and you're the first
thing he sees, you'll need one.

776
01:06:43,309 --> 01:06:45,775
Well, that was fun
while it didn't last.

777
01:06:45,777 --> 01:06:46,878
She could've stopped me.

778
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,311
I practically dared her to.

779
01:06:48,313 --> 01:06:50,082
I don't see why
you're pushing her.

780
01:06:52,418 --> 01:06:53,751
We have to boost the signal.

781
01:06:53,753 --> 01:06:55,485
Put it through
the Batmobile speakers.

782
01:06:55,487 --> 01:06:56,787
Yeah, now you're changing
the subject.

783
01:06:56,789 --> 01:06:58,521
- I have a contingency.
- What?

784
01:06:58,523 --> 01:07:00,256
Diana was right about the risk.

785
01:07:00,258 --> 01:07:03,427
If the plan goes south, we're
gonna bring in the big guns.

786
01:07:03,429 --> 01:07:04,728
But that's not...

787
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:07,298
Those are very big guns.

788
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,633
You've got a team here.

789
01:07:08,635 --> 01:07:09,967
Superman would bring
this team together

790
01:07:09,969 --> 01:07:11,836
better than I ever could.
His strength...

791
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:13,371
It doesn't matter
how strong you are.

792
01:07:13,373 --> 01:07:15,340
<i>Or what abilities
you might have...</i>

793
01:07:15,342 --> 01:07:16,742
He was more human than I am.

794
01:07:21,581 --> 01:07:23,514
He lived in this world.

795
01:07:23,516 --> 01:07:25,751
Fell in love. Had a job.

796
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,255
Despite all that power.

797
01:07:30,489 --> 01:07:31,824
The world needs Superman.

798
01:07:35,394 --> 01:07:36,796
And the team needs Clark.

799
01:07:37,695 --> 01:07:39,132
And what does Clark need?

800
01:07:40,498 --> 01:07:42,034
Maybe he's at peace.

801
01:07:43,269 --> 01:07:44,271
He'll get over it.

802
01:07:55,047 --> 01:07:58,682
You know, I could do
this a lot faster. I just...

803
01:07:58,684 --> 01:08:00,885
Is it weird that
it feels disrespectful?

804
01:08:00,887 --> 01:08:01,888
Yep.

805
01:08:03,222 --> 01:08:05,088
Do you feel a sense
of confidence

806
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:09,295
that we're not doing something
horribly wrong and macabre here?

807
01:08:10,195 --> 01:08:11,729
Not really.

808
01:08:11,731 --> 01:08:14,398
- Okay, then why...
- Because I saw Steppenwolf up close.

809
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,937
The stories Diana told us,
I believe them.

810
01:08:18,937 --> 01:08:20,770
Why we gotta stop him.

811
01:08:20,772 --> 01:08:22,007
That's the plan.

812
01:08:23,142 --> 01:08:24,143
That's the plan.

813
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:29,980
Okay. We're not ready for...

814
01:08:29,982 --> 01:08:32,217
It's racially charged.

815
01:08:34,019 --> 01:08:36,087
You got struck
by lightning, huh?

816
01:08:36,089 --> 01:08:39,390
Uh, yeah,
that's the abridged version.

817
01:08:39,392 --> 01:08:40,961
- And you...
- Explosion.

818
01:08:41,561 --> 01:08:42,926
Woke up in a lab.

819
01:08:42,928 --> 01:08:44,663
So we're the accidents.

820
01:08:45,865 --> 01:08:47,267
Yeah, that's us.

821
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:50,370
Hey. No, no.

822
01:09:02,447 --> 01:09:04,815
<i>We're approaching
the Kryptonian ship.</i>

823
01:09:04,817 --> 01:09:06,786
<i>ETA 30 seconds.</i>

824
01:09:12,424 --> 01:09:13,892
I'm here for him.

825
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,996
- I swear I would never...
- Save it.

826
01:09:38,284 --> 01:09:39,853
- Okay.
- Okay.

827
01:09:40,786 --> 01:09:41,987
Okay.

828
01:10:02,808 --> 01:10:04,710
This is amazing.

829
01:10:05,577 --> 01:10:06,843
This is crazy.

830
01:10:06,845 --> 01:10:09,246
Oh, what, now it's crazy?

831
01:10:09,248 --> 01:10:11,250
You lunatics better know
what you're doing.

832
01:11:00,833 --> 01:11:02,736
<i>Welcome.</i>

833
01:11:04,535 --> 01:11:07,938
Lex Luthor fried the circuits
bringing his creature to life.

834
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:10,143
There's not enough charge
to wake the box.

835
01:11:11,009 --> 01:11:12,278
I might be able to do it.

836
01:11:13,245 --> 01:11:15,579
I might be able
to jump-start it.

837
01:11:15,581 --> 01:11:17,748
If I can get enough distance, I can
conduct a significant electrical current.

838
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:21,185
I might be able to wake
the box. If that's...

839
01:11:21,187 --> 01:11:23,389
- still what we want.
- We have to try.

840
01:11:28,695 --> 01:11:29,926
This must be the end
of the line.

841
01:11:29,928 --> 01:11:31,830
<i>So, I'm in position.</i>

842
01:11:35,267 --> 01:11:36,934
The Mother Box is ready.

843
01:11:36,936 --> 01:11:39,502
You have to charge it the moment
it touches the fluid.

844
01:11:39,504 --> 01:11:41,038
- Five.
- Five.

845
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,440
Diana's right.
This is a bad idea.

846
01:11:44,442 --> 01:11:46,146
- Four.
- Four.

847
01:11:47,179 --> 01:11:49,214
<i>- Three.</i>
- Three.

848
01:11:49,682 --> 01:11:51,448
Two.

849
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:53,051
Two.

850
01:11:53,785 --> 01:11:54,987
<i>One.</i>

851
01:13:39,424 --> 01:13:40,626
He's back.

852
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,673
<i>Dispatch,
this is 3-Adam-1-6.</i>

853
01:13:57,675 --> 01:13:58,876
<i>Backing up Code Three.</i>

854
01:13:58,878 --> 01:14:00,078
<i>I'm currently two minutes out.</i>

855
01:14:03,281 --> 01:14:04,914
He's not all right.

856
01:14:04,916 --> 01:14:06,016
<i>Copy that.</i>

857
01:14:08,254 --> 01:14:10,386
- He's scanning us.
- What?

858
01:14:10,388 --> 01:14:12,956
Arthur, you need to relax.
Your adrenaline's spiking.

859
01:14:12,958 --> 01:14:14,091
Because he's not all right.

860
01:14:14,093 --> 01:14:15,359
Oh, no.

861
01:14:15,361 --> 01:14:18,164
Should we bow?
Or show our bellies?

862
01:14:21,133 --> 01:14:23,533
Victor? Victor!

863
01:14:23,535 --> 01:14:25,136
- Shit!
- What are you doing?

864
01:14:25,138 --> 01:14:26,403
- Victor!
- It's my armor's

865
01:14:26,405 --> 01:14:27,738
- defense system.
- No!

866
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:29,405
It's stronger
since the interface.

867
01:14:29,407 --> 01:14:31,042
- I can't control it.
- Victor, no! Victor!

868
01:14:31,044 --> 01:14:32,876
Just think
happy thoughts, Victor.

869
01:14:32,878 --> 01:14:34,179
Go to a happier place.

870
01:14:45,958 --> 01:14:47,293
Kal-El, no!

871
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:58,034
He's confused.
He doesn't know who he is.

872
01:14:58,036 --> 01:14:59,271
<i>Pet Sematary.</i>

873
01:15:05,044 --> 01:15:07,610
Arthur, we need to restrain him.

874
01:15:13,018 --> 01:15:14,219
I got him.

875
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:35,107
Kal-El, the last son of Krypton.

876
01:15:36,241 --> 01:15:38,378
Remember who you are.

877
01:15:40,178 --> 01:15:42,447
Tell me who you...

878
01:16:39,205 --> 01:16:40,440
<i>Clark.</i>

879
01:16:44,643 --> 01:16:45,811
I know you.

880
01:16:52,450 --> 01:16:54,419
Please don't make me do this.

881
01:17:15,708 --> 01:17:17,610
Alfred, I need the big gun.

882
01:17:23,115 --> 01:17:25,181
You did this.

883
01:17:25,183 --> 01:17:26,850
I had to.

884
01:17:26,852 --> 01:17:28,488
You won't let me live.

885
01:17:29,855 --> 01:17:31,456
You won't let me die.

886
01:17:32,191 --> 01:17:33,626
The world needs you.

887
01:17:38,429 --> 01:17:39,898
But does it need you?

888
01:17:42,099 --> 01:17:43,369
Tell me.

889
01:17:45,336 --> 01:17:46,772
Do you bleed?

890
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,275
<i>Clark!</i>

891
01:17:58,817 --> 01:17:59,818
Clark.

892
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:02,622
Please.

893
01:18:21,874 --> 01:18:22,875
Please.

894
01:18:30,249 --> 01:18:31,483
Please.

895
01:18:32,217 --> 01:18:33,518
Just go.

896
01:18:34,754 --> 01:18:35,755
Yeah.

897
01:18:36,655 --> 01:18:37,690
Let's go.

898
01:18:49,433 --> 01:18:52,605
Yeah, something
is definitely bleeding.

899
01:19:13,125 --> 01:19:14,393
The Mother Box.

900
01:19:15,861 --> 01:19:17,330
He has the last one.

901
01:19:31,876 --> 01:19:33,612
You brought us here.

902
01:19:35,347 --> 01:19:36,648
You remembered.

903
01:19:39,317 --> 01:19:40,552
This is home.

904
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,356
You smell good.

905
01:19:48,326 --> 01:19:49,561
Did I not before?

906
01:20:05,611 --> 01:20:07,042
Don't do that.

907
01:20:07,044 --> 01:20:08,944
We just got our asses
handed to us.

908
01:20:08,946 --> 01:20:11,181
And Steppenwolf has got
the third box.

909
01:20:11,183 --> 01:20:13,383
So we find them.

910
01:20:13,385 --> 01:20:15,452
If the boxes are even close
to each other,

911
01:20:15,454 --> 01:20:17,988
there is going to be
some kind of energy surge.

912
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:20,690
Steppenwolf's gonna be keeping
them somewhere where they don't read.

913
01:20:20,692 --> 01:20:22,824
No Internet,
no satellite coverage.

914
01:20:22,826 --> 01:20:25,494
- Well, that narrows it down.
<i>- Not enough.</i>

915
01:20:25,496 --> 01:20:27,396
So, you can't find them.

916
01:20:27,398 --> 01:20:28,800
Or maybe you don't want to.

917
01:20:32,004 --> 01:20:33,537
Arthur.

918
01:20:33,539 --> 01:20:34,904
Yeah, that was a great way
to get rid of Superman.

919
01:20:34,906 --> 01:20:37,172
Man, I'm not doing
this on purpose.

920
01:20:37,174 --> 01:20:40,109
Right, 'cause you can't
control the machine.

921
01:20:40,111 --> 01:20:43,748
So is this a bad time
to bring up my blood sugar?

922
01:20:46,084 --> 01:20:47,085
Very hungry.

923
01:20:49,254 --> 01:20:51,020
Victor.

924
01:20:51,022 --> 01:20:54,858
You can find the boxes.
You share their energy.

925
01:20:54,860 --> 01:20:57,493
I know it's frightening,
but if you go under,

926
01:20:57,495 --> 01:20:59,898
I promise we will pull
you back out.

927
01:21:03,235 --> 01:21:05,804
Just keep the little merman
away from me while I work.

928
01:21:09,741 --> 01:21:12,274
Barry, go find Alfred
in the pantry.

929
01:21:12,276 --> 01:21:13,709
When you come back, get online.

930
01:21:13,711 --> 01:21:15,548
Everybody checks
everybody else's work.

931
01:21:16,614 --> 01:21:18,081
Listen...

932
01:21:18,083 --> 01:21:22,519
I was wondering if you could
put out a feeler.

933
01:21:22,521 --> 01:21:24,056
Like, aquatic.

934
01:21:26,525 --> 01:21:27,826
Do you talk to fish?

935
01:21:29,829 --> 01:21:32,465
The water does the talking.

936
01:21:33,365 --> 01:21:34,864
Of course.

937
01:21:34,866 --> 01:21:37,066
If the current comes in strange,
it might point the way.

938
01:21:37,836 --> 01:21:38,838
Okay.

939
01:22:02,361 --> 01:22:03,562
Wait.

940
01:22:04,463 --> 01:22:06,596
Let me.

941
01:22:06,598 --> 01:22:07,999
It's just a little out of place.

942
01:22:10,669 --> 01:22:13,770
So Clark seemed to share
your view on being woken up.

943
01:22:13,772 --> 01:22:15,706
He could've killed you.

944
01:22:15,708 --> 01:22:17,143
I was willing to make the trade.

945
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:21,910
And bringing in Lois Lane?

946
01:22:21,912 --> 01:22:23,846
Remember what you told me
about heart in the hangar?

947
01:22:23,848 --> 01:22:25,015
I bet you...

948
01:22:25,017 --> 01:22:26,519
...thought I wasn't listening.

949
01:22:27,952 --> 01:22:28,987
Thank you.

950
01:22:33,023 --> 01:22:34,658
You know you can't
do this forever.

951
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:36,495
I can barely do it now.

952
01:22:37,329 --> 01:22:38,597
Steppenwolf.

953
01:22:39,264 --> 01:22:40,329
This is the job.

954
01:22:40,331 --> 01:22:42,465
It's my job.

955
01:22:42,467 --> 01:22:45,036
And I haven't been doing it.
I've been reacting.

956
01:22:46,138 --> 01:22:47,139
Not leading.

957
01:22:50,308 --> 01:22:51,975
You know, what you said
about Steve Trevor...

958
01:22:51,977 --> 01:22:53,679
It wasn't my business.
I'm sorry.

959
01:22:55,681 --> 01:22:57,950
You were pushing me
to lead the team.

960
01:22:58,983 --> 01:23:00,952
But leaders get people killed.

961
01:23:02,153 --> 01:23:07,658
I fought always
when I was needed.

962
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:11,728
But to lead, to step into the
light and to say to people,

963
01:23:11,730 --> 01:23:13,632
"This is worth your life."

964
01:23:15,599 --> 01:23:17,035
When it's your fault,

965
01:23:19,537 --> 01:23:20,973
they're all Steve Trevor.

966
01:23:23,674 --> 01:23:27,612
We make it through tonight, you
can stay in the shadows forever.

967
01:23:29,114 --> 01:23:30,413
Dress up like a bat.

968
01:23:30,415 --> 01:23:31,684
I won't even sue.

969
01:23:32,817 --> 01:23:35,253
If we get through the night.

970
01:23:56,174 --> 01:23:57,209
Are you okay?

971
01:23:59,811 --> 01:24:01,077
You brought us here,
but you've...

972
01:24:01,079 --> 01:24:03,378
hardly spent
a minute in the house.

973
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:04,883
I know. It's...

974
01:24:07,451 --> 01:24:09,053
I just got out of a wooden box.

975
01:24:12,124 --> 01:24:13,157
What was it like?

976
01:24:15,227 --> 01:24:16,228
Coming back?

977
01:24:20,266 --> 01:24:21,299
Itchy.

978
01:24:23,233 --> 01:24:29,206
I mean, honestly,
weird in so many ways.

979
01:24:29,208 --> 01:24:32,076
- But mostly just...
- I wasn't strong.

980
01:24:35,647 --> 01:24:36,849
I didn't, um...

981
01:24:38,349 --> 01:24:40,350
You would've been
very disappointed in me.

982
01:24:40,352 --> 01:24:44,857
I wasn't Lois Lane,
the dedicated reporter.

983
01:24:45,491 --> 01:24:47,222
I just...

984
01:24:47,224 --> 01:24:48,294
It's okay.

985
01:24:51,362 --> 01:24:52,731
I'm the idiot who left.

986
01:24:54,266 --> 01:24:56,399
But I'm back now.

987
01:24:56,401 --> 01:24:58,003
And I'm gonna make things right.

988
01:25:17,155 --> 01:25:18,157
Ah.

989
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:20,259
You called Mom.

990
01:25:22,059 --> 01:25:23,359
Of course.

991
01:25:23,361 --> 01:25:24,597
Thank you.

992
01:25:27,098 --> 01:25:30,835
I was hoping it was gonna
take you longer to recover.

993
01:25:32,437 --> 01:25:34,671
Why?

994
01:25:34,673 --> 01:25:36,809
Because now I have
to send you away.

995
01:25:39,577 --> 01:25:41,110
Bruce.

996
01:25:41,112 --> 01:25:42,845
He needs you.

997
01:25:42,847 --> 01:25:44,480
Fate of the world,
I think that's the deal.

998
01:25:44,482 --> 01:25:46,748
He was pretty tense.

999
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:48,350
Well, I guess I do owe him one.

1000
01:25:49,588 --> 01:25:50,822
Right.

1001
01:25:52,257 --> 01:25:53,392
But no dying.

1002
01:25:54,558 --> 01:25:55,994
And I get the exclusive.

1003
01:25:56,794 --> 01:25:58,097
Yes, ma'am.

1004
01:26:34,665 --> 01:26:35,831
Are you really you?

1005
01:26:35,833 --> 01:26:37,402
I'm really me, Ma.

1006
01:26:49,446 --> 01:26:50,815
At last.

1007
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:55,253
Praise to the unity!

1008
01:26:57,789 --> 01:26:59,291
The three as one.

1009
01:27:27,553 --> 01:27:31,023
Praise to the mother of horrors.

1010
01:27:40,699 --> 01:27:41,864
Is Steppenwolf there?

1011
01:27:41,866 --> 01:27:43,302
Just a minute.

1012
01:27:44,736 --> 01:27:46,301
Sorry.

1013
01:27:46,303 --> 01:27:48,605
It's Pozharnov
in northern Russia.

1014
01:27:48,607 --> 01:27:50,006
The nuclear plant.

1015
01:27:50,008 --> 01:27:51,640
Had a meltdown 30 years ago.

1016
01:27:51,642 --> 01:27:54,075
Uh-huh. There have been some
attempts to resettle nearby.

1017
01:27:54,077 --> 01:27:56,846
But it looks like
really rough sledding.

1018
01:27:56,848 --> 01:27:59,148
Who picks this place
to put down roots?

1019
01:27:59,150 --> 01:28:01,717
People that have been
kicked out of everywhere else.

1020
01:28:01,719 --> 01:28:05,188
The Earth starts changing,
it will hit them first.

1021
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:08,224
- How long have we got?
- A few hours.

1022
01:28:08,226 --> 01:28:10,062
Transport won't fly that fast.

1023
01:28:11,295 --> 01:28:12,396
It will for me.

1024
01:28:53,838 --> 01:28:58,507
The unity brings all three
boxes together in perfect sync.

1025
01:28:58,509 --> 01:29:01,810
Its power builds until
it can't be contained.

1026
01:29:01,812 --> 01:29:05,681
But if I can cause a delay between
each box, even for a nanosecond,

1027
01:29:05,683 --> 01:29:08,117
its energy will cascade,
form a loop.

1028
01:29:08,119 --> 01:29:09,519
They'll feed on each other.

1029
01:29:09,521 --> 01:29:11,554
And that's it?
We just pull them apart.

1030
01:29:11,556 --> 01:29:13,222
No fuss, no muss.

1031
01:29:13,224 --> 01:29:15,824
Separating the boxes is still
gonna cause a massive surge.

1032
01:29:15,826 --> 01:29:17,260
I'll have to be there.

1033
01:29:17,262 --> 01:29:19,028
But you guys should think
about getting clear.

1034
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:20,762
We're with you till it's done.

1035
01:29:20,764 --> 01:29:23,045
Honestly, I think we're all
gonna be dead way before that.

1036
01:29:23,602 --> 01:29:25,066
And you know what?

1037
01:29:25,068 --> 01:29:28,070
I don't mind.
It's an honorable end.

1038
01:29:28,072 --> 01:29:30,174
But we gotta shut
Steppenwolf down.

1039
01:29:31,041 --> 01:29:32,774
Superman's a no-show.

1040
01:29:32,776 --> 01:29:34,610
You got no powers. No offense.

1041
01:29:34,612 --> 01:29:37,279
This guy might be working
for the enemy, we don't know.

1042
01:29:37,281 --> 01:29:39,284
You're tripping over your feet
and mine.

1043
01:29:40,485 --> 01:29:41,950
Oof...

1044
01:29:41,952 --> 01:29:43,252
You're gorgeous.

1045
01:29:43,254 --> 01:29:45,654
And fierce, and strong,
and... Mmm.

1046
01:29:45,656 --> 01:29:48,457
I know we went to war with the
Amazons, but that was before my time.

1047
01:29:48,459 --> 01:29:51,093
And you know what?
I don't wanna die.

1048
01:29:51,095 --> 01:29:53,098
I'm young. There's shit
that I want to do.

1049
01:29:53,865 --> 01:29:55,364
I just feel like...

1050
01:29:55,366 --> 01:29:57,832
I didn't really embrace
the sea or the land.

1051
01:29:57,834 --> 01:29:59,301
I've been a loner my whole life.

1052
01:29:59,303 --> 01:30:02,140
But being part of something
bigger like this,

1053
01:30:03,374 --> 01:30:06,510
maybe I'm scared because
I'm meant to...

1054
01:30:18,757 --> 01:30:20,392
I think that was beautiful.

1055
01:30:23,661 --> 01:30:27,098
You say a word about this, and
you'll meet every piranha I know.

1056
01:30:29,567 --> 01:30:33,037
I honestly didn't hear anything
after, "We're all gonna die."

1057
01:30:53,525 --> 01:30:56,561
Ah. Let them come.

1058
01:31:04,436 --> 01:31:07,604
I'm going to take out that tower
and knock down that shield dome.

1059
01:31:07,606 --> 01:31:08,738
You get to Steppenwolf.

1060
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:11,043
Don't wait for me,
just do the job.

1061
01:32:15,107 --> 01:32:17,239
All right, Alfred.
Are we set for broadcast?

1062
01:32:17,241 --> 01:32:20,278
Playing all your favorite hits.

1063
01:32:30,187 --> 01:32:32,556
Come on, follow me,
you damn insects.

1064
01:32:43,735 --> 01:32:44,800
They're coming.

1065
01:32:46,771 --> 01:32:48,106
They're all coming.

1066
01:32:51,575 --> 01:32:52,740
<i>Ah.</i>

1067
01:32:52,742 --> 01:32:54,713
We might not have
thought this through.

1068
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:00,617
He's clearing the field.

1069
01:33:00,619 --> 01:33:02,383
He won't last three minutes.

1070
01:33:02,385 --> 01:33:03,621
Then let's use them.

1071
01:33:07,157 --> 01:33:08,360
On my lead.

1072
01:34:21,432 --> 01:34:22,800
<i>Critical damage.</i>

1073
01:34:24,968 --> 01:34:26,370
Son of a bitch.

1074
01:34:29,307 --> 01:34:30,709
Oh, snap!

1075
01:34:34,879 --> 01:34:35,913
You're welcome.

1076
01:34:38,883 --> 01:34:40,082
Yeah!

1077
01:34:40,084 --> 01:34:41,283
This isn't the plan.

1078
01:34:41,285 --> 01:34:42,653
<i>No, Master Wayne.</i>

1079
01:34:43,321 --> 01:34:44,689
This is the team.

1080
01:34:45,522 --> 01:34:47,256
Hey, blame the lady.

1081
01:34:47,258 --> 01:34:49,298
We would've left you,
but she didn't ask for a vote.

1082
01:34:52,297 --> 01:34:54,898
So your genius move
is dying?

1083
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:56,599
You really are out of your mind.

1084
01:34:56,601 --> 01:34:58,603
I'm not the one
who brought a pitchfork.

1085
01:35:00,370 --> 01:35:02,606
Yahoo!

1086
01:35:21,992 --> 01:35:23,258
Ride ain't over yet.

1087
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:24,495
My man.

1088
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:12,140
<i>Is this what conquering is?</i>

1089
01:36:12,142 --> 01:36:13,644
Hiding from the fight?

1090
01:36:14,277 --> 01:36:15,879
Oh, no.

1091
01:36:16,813 --> 01:36:18,381
You're all mine.

1092
01:36:24,355 --> 01:36:26,122
- Thanks for the lift.
- Yeah, no problem.

1093
01:36:26,124 --> 01:36:27,289
You got this?

1094
01:36:27,291 --> 01:36:28,890
Whoa!

1095
01:36:28,892 --> 01:36:30,392
These things are gonna
keep coming.

1096
01:36:30,394 --> 01:36:32,560
Okay. You get technical,
I'm on bug duty.

1097
01:36:32,562 --> 01:36:33,831
Let's do it.

1098
01:36:38,535 --> 01:36:41,505
Yes! That was gross! Oh...

1099
01:37:01,424 --> 01:37:02,626
Thank you.

1100
01:37:04,361 --> 01:37:05,697
This is...

1101
01:37:07,431 --> 01:37:08,633
This is a lot.

1102
01:37:28,585 --> 01:37:30,722
Now do you see it?

1103
01:37:51,041 --> 01:37:54,609
<i>Whatever you're in the
middle of, it's spreading for miles.</i>

1104
01:37:54,611 --> 01:37:57,679
Satellites show civilians
moving east.

1105
01:37:57,681 --> 01:37:59,382
They're not gonna make it.

1106
01:37:59,384 --> 01:38:00,748
Barry.

1107
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:02,353
<i>I need you to take a walk.</i>

1108
01:38:09,192 --> 01:38:10,728
God, I hope this is east.

1109
01:38:56,607 --> 01:39:00,575
You're not worthy
to touch Mother.

1110
01:39:00,577 --> 01:39:05,950
She's power, and power is the only law.

1111
01:39:11,723 --> 01:39:15,291
You're all too weak
to see the truth.

1112
01:39:15,293 --> 01:39:16,527
Well...

1113
01:39:18,028 --> 01:39:19,496
I believe in truth.

1114
01:39:20,798 --> 01:39:22,934
But I'm also a big fan
of justice.

1115
01:39:31,407 --> 01:39:32,507
All right.

1116
01:39:36,647 --> 01:39:38,148
Kryptonian!

1117
01:39:55,866 --> 01:39:57,999
So, how do I help?

1118
01:39:58,001 --> 01:40:01,071
We buy him some time, he can stop that
box from destroying all life on Earth.

1119
01:40:02,173 --> 01:40:04,006
We hope.

1120
01:40:04,008 --> 01:40:06,408
Well, I knew you didn't bring
me back 'cause you liked me.

1121
01:40:06,410 --> 01:40:08,709
I don't not...

1122
01:40:14,686 --> 01:40:16,385
- Civilians.
- Barry's headed...

1123
01:40:16,387 --> 01:40:17,621
There's too many of them.

1124
01:40:26,763 --> 01:40:27,998
Come on.

1125
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:43,914
Okay, this is definitely east.

1126
01:40:50,655 --> 01:40:52,320
Slowpoke.

1127
01:40:52,322 --> 01:40:53,521
Oh, it's on.

1128
01:40:53,523 --> 01:40:55,026
I'll take the ones on the right.

1129
01:40:57,827 --> 01:40:59,030
It's okay.

1130
01:40:59,931 --> 01:41:01,833
Hold on. Hold on. Yeah.

1131
01:41:20,117 --> 01:41:21,285
Dostoevsky!

1132
01:41:38,335 --> 01:41:40,271
Is this guy
still bothering you?

1133
01:41:54,518 --> 01:41:55,950
Superman!

1134
01:41:55,952 --> 01:41:57,420
We gotta pull
these things apart.

1135
01:41:57,422 --> 01:42:00,922
A couple more seconds,
you'll see your opening.

1136
01:42:00,924 --> 01:42:03,591
- Any blowback?
- Big time.

1137
01:42:03,593 --> 01:42:05,093
But I think we can take it.

1138
01:42:05,095 --> 01:42:06,761
Good.

1139
01:42:06,763 --> 01:42:08,298
'Cause I really like
being alive.

1140
01:42:09,566 --> 01:42:10,802
So do I.

1141
01:42:34,157 --> 01:42:35,192
Clark.

1142
01:42:41,298 --> 01:42:42,367
I take it back.

1143
01:42:43,468 --> 01:42:44,736
I wanna die.

1144
01:42:48,772 --> 01:42:51,605
Man, my toes hurt!

1145
01:42:51,607 --> 01:42:54,676
I don't even understand
the physics of how my toes hurt.

1146
01:42:56,213 --> 01:42:59,150
Children. I work with children.

1147
01:43:01,985 --> 01:43:05,787
Uh... Have you guys seen
what's going on outside?

1148
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:17,702
I am the end of worlds!

1149
01:43:18,803 --> 01:43:22,073
Who are you to defy...

1150
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:27,178
This world is my right!

1151
01:43:48,665 --> 01:43:50,365
No!

1152
01:43:50,367 --> 01:43:52,499
This cannot be.

1153
01:43:52,501 --> 01:43:54,168
You recognize that smell?

1154
01:43:55,740 --> 01:43:56,974
Fear.

1155
01:44:00,443 --> 01:44:02,245
No! Leave me!

1156
01:44:05,682 --> 01:44:08,716
Get off me! I command you.

1157
01:44:10,187 --> 01:44:11,222
No!

1158
01:44:13,624 --> 01:44:14,925
No!

1159
01:44:16,526 --> 01:44:18,126
I'll kill you!

1160
01:44:18,128 --> 01:44:20,031
I'll kill you all!

1161
01:44:45,388 --> 01:44:46,456
Booyah!

1162
01:45:11,915 --> 01:45:13,284
I'm glad I didn't miss this.

1163
01:45:15,184 --> 01:45:16,219
So am I.

1164
01:45:16,754 --> 01:45:18,019
Yeah.

1165
01:45:18,021 --> 01:45:19,357
Now she's glad.

1166
01:45:50,187 --> 01:45:53,387
"Thank you" is not enough
for what you did.

1167
01:45:53,389 --> 01:45:56,259
I just undid a mistake,
that's all.

1168
01:46:05,669 --> 01:46:07,438
How did you get the house back
from the bank?

1169
01:46:08,806 --> 01:46:10,141
I bought the bank.

1170
01:46:12,843 --> 01:46:14,376
The whole bank?

1171
01:46:14,378 --> 01:46:16,380
It's like a reflex with me.
I don't know.

1172
01:46:20,284 --> 01:46:21,783
What?

1173
01:46:21,785 --> 01:46:24,752
It's actually the worst job
you can get in a crime lab.

1174
01:46:24,754 --> 01:46:27,422
But my foot's in the door.

1175
01:46:27,424 --> 01:46:30,225
Yeah, I got a recommendation
from a friend.

1176
01:46:30,227 --> 01:46:31,996
This is like a "job" job?

1177
01:46:32,728 --> 01:46:33,931
"Job" job.

1178
01:46:37,634 --> 01:46:38,936
Look at you go.

1179
01:46:56,887 --> 01:47:02,293
<i>Darkness, the truest darkness,
is not the absence of light.</i>

1180
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:07,330
<i>It is the conviction that
the light will never return.</i>

1181
01:47:08,232 --> 01:47:10,931
Must be 100, 150 feet.

1182
01:47:10,933 --> 01:47:12,135
Must be.

1183
01:47:13,637 --> 01:47:15,503
Big round table.

1184
01:47:15,505 --> 01:47:17,374
Six chairs, right there.

1185
01:47:18,709 --> 01:47:19,977
But room for more.

1186
01:47:22,745 --> 01:47:25,713
But room for more.

1187
01:47:25,715 --> 01:47:30,287
<i>But the light always returns
to show us things familiar.</i>

1188
01:47:31,888 --> 01:47:34,557
<i>Home, family,</i>

1189
01:47:36,293 --> 01:47:40,998
<i>and things entirely new,
or long overlooked.</i>

1190
01:47:46,070 --> 01:47:51,208
<i>It shows us new possibilities and
challenges us to pursue them.</i>

1191
01:47:52,675 --> 01:47:54,642
Yeah, and Jerry Monasco
runs the whole kit.

1192
01:47:54,644 --> 01:47:56,578
I mean, he did the Bilbao job
two years ago.

1193
01:47:56,580 --> 01:47:58,579
Yeah, he has it all in storage
in Croydon.

1194
01:47:58,581 --> 01:48:00,382
- The Belgian?
- Right, yeah, the Belgian.

1195
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:03,519
<i>This time,
the light shone on the heroes</i>

1196
01:48:03,521 --> 01:48:07,525
<i>coming out of the shadows to
tell us we won't be alone again.</i>

1197
01:48:09,593 --> 01:48:14,863
<i>Our darkness was deep
and seemed to swallow all hope.</i>

1198
01:48:14,865 --> 01:48:18,266
<i>But these heroes
were here the whole time</i>

1199
01:48:18,268 --> 01:48:23,440
<i>to remind us that hope is
real, that you can see it.</i>

1200
01:48:28,144 --> 01:48:30,481
<i>All you have to do is look</i>

1201
01:48:33,150 --> 01:48:34,418
<i>up in the sky.</i>

1202
01:49:32,977 --> 01:49:36,078
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate you doing this.

1203
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:37,314
Not at all, Barry.

1204
01:49:38,181 --> 01:49:39,614
Curious myself.

1205
01:49:39,616 --> 01:49:41,216
Yeah, and it's not like
a competition, you know?

1206
01:49:41,218 --> 01:49:43,484
Well, it is a competition.

1207
01:49:43,486 --> 01:49:46,688
But, you know, it's not like
a macho measuring thing.

1208
01:49:46,690 --> 01:49:48,192
But if I win,
you're off the team.

1209
01:49:54,297 --> 01:49:56,067
- No...
- Oof.

1210
01:49:57,168 --> 01:49:59,033
If I win,

1211
01:49:59,035 --> 01:50:02,302
Bruce said something about you
having to take us all to brunch?

1212
01:50:02,304 --> 01:50:05,006
Oh, see, now that's cold.
That's a betrayal.

1213
01:50:05,008 --> 01:50:06,309
I feel stung by that.

1214
01:50:08,277 --> 01:50:09,944
Okay, but if I win,
I get to tell everyone.

1215
01:50:09,946 --> 01:50:11,147
Deal.

1216
01:50:11,882 --> 01:50:13,480
Which coast?

1217
01:50:13,482 --> 01:50:15,418
Ah, you know,
I've never seen the Pacific.

1218
01:50:17,053 --> 01:50:18,285
Which is that way.

1219
01:50:18,287 --> 01:50:21,357
Because the sun and it's...

1220
01:58:07,156 --> 01:58:08,989
All right,
let's keep it moving.

1221
01:58:08,991 --> 01:58:10,791
<i>Come on, Luthor. Let's go.</i>

1222
01:58:12,062 --> 01:58:13,063
<i>Luthor!</i>

1223
01:58:22,339 --> 01:58:23,872
All right,
stop jerking around, Luthor,

1224
01:58:23,874 --> 01:58:25,275
or I'm gonna have
to come in there.

1225
01:58:58,407 --> 01:59:00,774
Ah! There he is. Welcome aboard.

1226
01:59:00,776 --> 01:59:02,877
Care for a glass
of Goût de Diamants?

1227
01:59:02,879 --> 01:59:04,712
I was just celebrating
God's return

1228
01:59:04,714 --> 01:59:07,481
out of the ground
and back up into the sky.

1229
01:59:07,483 --> 01:59:10,952
He and his odd little friends
are forming some sort of league.

1230
01:59:10,954 --> 01:59:12,619
You better not
be wasting my time.

1231
01:59:12,621 --> 01:59:16,457
No. I have too much to live for
and more important things to do.

1232
01:59:16,459 --> 01:59:19,296
We have to level
the playing field, Mr. Wilson.

1233
01:59:20,330 --> 01:59:21,665
To put it plainly

1234
01:59:23,232 --> 01:59:26,235
shouldn't we have
a league of our own?

1234
01:59:27,305 --> 02:00:27,785

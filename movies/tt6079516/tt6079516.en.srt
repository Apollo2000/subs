[boy] You know, my birthday
isn't for another two months.

I know that.

And given her the satisfaction?

32
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,278
So when'd you start
sleeping on the couch?

not that I blame you.

what she did.

36

Hey, hey.
None of that.

37
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,968
So, what, you getting
into fights now?

38
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,570
They were being assholes.

That's no excuse.

your mom and me...

So how'd the other kid look?

44
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,655
The other two kids.

45

<i>Well, I also wanna talk.</i>

53
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:52,604

[receptionist] Dr. Harper,

61
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,905
[woman]
Justin Whitter, 10 years old.

62
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:02,641
Went missing on a bike ride
last night near Troubadour Park.

63
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:05,043
Park ranger
found the bike, no boy.

64
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,412
Just like Michael King?

65
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,814
No, we don't know if
the two are connected.

66
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,082
Michael King was abducted

67
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,717
cycling to a corner store
in the city.

68
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:16,321
Justin Whitter, local boy.
Good home, respected family.

69
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:17,589
He went missing on county lines,

70
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,691
but as of nine o'clock
this morning

71
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,159
the case was ruled ours.

72
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,362
Does Spitz know about this?

73
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,498
It's up to him if
he wants to get involved.

74
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,467
He'll wanna get involved.

75
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,837
I'll let you manage the
situation as you see fit.

76
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,940
You're lead on this.

77
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,174
Got it.

78
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,915

Connor?

82
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:51,316
Connor?

83
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,354
[screams, gasps]
Whoa! Whoa.

84
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,323
I'm just a window repairman.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

85
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,192
What are you doing here?
Your husband called about a broken window.

86
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,194
Just finished putting
in a new one for you.

87
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,263
Oh, my God.

88
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,799
[repairman] Okeydokey.

89
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,434
Just give me a jingle if you
have any problems with it,

90
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,036
and have a good day.

91
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,137
Thank you.

92
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,039
I'm sorry, who let you in?

93
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,874
That kid of yours.
Very polite.

94
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,643
You trained her well.
[phone ringing]

95
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,679
Who?
[repairman] Yeah, John. No.

96
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:28,153
And the truth is,
anything you find

97
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,321
could be important.

98
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:35,293
Justin was last seen wearing a
green soccer jersey and carrying...

99
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,495
[detective]
Gonna want answers, and fast.

100
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:41,332
So the kid's riding his bike
all alone through the woods.

101
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,134
The parents are okay with that?

102
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,537
[detective] He's 10.
Figure he's old enough.

103
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,074
[Greg] How's the home life?
You know, really.

104
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:50,742
Mom, dad, two happy kids.

105
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:53,978
Perfect all-American family.
[phone ringing]

106
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,580
Yeah.

107
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:57,716
Aren't they all?

108
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,885
Lisa and I went through
that rough patch last year.

109
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,387
Hey, come on, Spitz.

110
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,489
Look,

111
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:06,324
I'm not saying I know anything.

112
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,093
Just there was this counselor.

113
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,894
Jackie is a counselor.

114
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,397
[sighs] Yeah.
We'll be fine.

115
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,165
[man]
There's something up here!

116

[shutter clicks]

117
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,572
All right, step away.
What you got?

118
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,446
Jesus Christ.

119
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,583
[policewoman] Sir,
should we bring it in?

120
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,119
Yeah.
Yeah, you can...

121
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:36,588
You can bag it.

122
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,690
Thanks, Kayla.

123
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,261
Spitz.

124
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,931
You okay?

125
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,534
You remember Cole Gordon?
It was before your time.

126
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:50,769
Oh, of course I remember.

127
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,036
The green knives.

128
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:54,773
Six boys.

129
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,242
All found buried
with those knives.

130
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:58,543
Yeah, I know.

131
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,312
But Gordon, he's...

132
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:02,547
Yeah, yeah,
I helped put him there,

133
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,149
and he ain't getting out.

134
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,550
So what're you thinking?

135

[slurping]

136
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,206

137
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:36,815
Thank you.

138
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:42,053
Hey, did you let a repairman in
today when I wasn't here?

139
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,656
Jesus, Mom,
is that who it was?

140
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:47,892
Did you screw a repairman?

141
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,032
Okay.

142
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,301
Okay, you're angry.

143
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:57,669
How could you do that?

144
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,372
How could you do that to Dad?

145
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,413
Who was it?

146
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,983
Just someone, sweetie...

147
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:14,285
Oh, you don't get
to call me that.

148
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:17,055
You don't ever get
to call me that again.

149
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:18,489
I see how mad you are.

150
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,458
You don't get to act
like nothing happened!

151
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,994
You think pancakes and fancy
dinners are gonna make it up?

152
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:26,531
No, I don't... You ruined our family
and you should fucking pay for it!

shitty silverware?

You know why you're here, Spitz.

of a serial child abductor
you put away 15 years ago.

to build a case for a mistrial.

00:23:58,037 --> 00:23:59,437
They didn't waste any time.

I'm sorry to disappoint
the dickhead lawyer,

269
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:03,107
but Gordon was a
convicted pedophile

full of those knives,

of the victims we found at his house.

it's probably a copycat.

in front of this.

What are you doing here?

327
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:25,109
I took the bus out
this morning.

328
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:26,777
I'm staying with a college
buddy in Braxfield.

329
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,178
Did you not get my messages?

330
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,848
You cannot be here.
My son is here.

331
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,017
Well, let's go somewhere.
Take the day off work.

332
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:35,319
It's so good to see you.
No, no, no, no.

Did you not get my texts?

334
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,625
Did I freak you out by what I said last time?
No.

335
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:44,528
Because that was a whole different...
Because I'm in love with you!

I don't want to be with you.

I know you're scared.

355
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:33,711
This reminds me of high school.
Remember?

No, what're you talking about?

I can pick him up.

487
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,628
["A Man at the Frontier" by Marc Morvan,
Ben Jarry playing]

488
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:59,469
[music continues]

489
00:44:07,078 --> 00:44:08,244
[screaming]

490
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:54,991
[girl, boy laughing]

491
00:44:54,993 --> 00:44:56,893
Did you get that on camera?

492
00:44:56,895 --> 00:44:59,896
[boy] Yeah. I thought that wasn't
gonna happen. I was so close.

493
00:44:59,898 --> 00:45:00,997
Hell yeah!

494
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:03,466
Holy shit.

495
00:45:03,468 --> 00:45:04,867
You see this view?

496
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:07,470
[boy] Wow.
[girl] What?

497
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,740
I don't think I've ever seen
a view this nice before.

498
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:13,142
[boy] Nobody deserves this.
[laughing]

499
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:18,214
[boy] That's a fridge?
What the hell?

500
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:22,485
[girl]
Hey, don't break anything.

501
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:24,287
[boy]
I wasn't planning on it.

502
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,657
[girl] Oh, my God!

503
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:28,925
They have "Battlestar"?

504
00:45:29,494 --> 00:45:31,394
Look at all that wine.

505
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:32,995
Bet they're alcoholics.

506
00:45:33,698 --> 00:45:35,231
Jesus.

507
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:38,101
They take so many pictures.

508
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:41,971
Creepy mom.

509
00:45:43,942 --> 00:45:46,509
It just keeps going
and going.

510
00:45:47,212 --> 00:45:49,145
It has, like, actual wings.

511
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:56,586
[boy]
They got you locked up.

512
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:04,127
[girl] Alec!

513
00:46:04,129 --> 00:46:05,995
Hey, check it out.
I found our room!

514
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:14,604
Guest room, baby.

515
00:46:17,976 --> 00:46:19,876
This is the life.

516
00:46:19,878 --> 00:46:21,377
[laughing]

517
00:46:21,379 --> 00:46:22,912
What the...

518
00:46:22,914 --> 00:46:26,215
These sheets are covered
in, like, a layer of dust.

519
00:46:26,217 --> 00:46:28,985
It's a fucking sandstorm,
Jesus.

520
00:46:28,987 --> 00:46:30,820
Do these people
not have friends?

521
00:46:30,822 --> 00:46:34,056
[Alec] Didn't you say we had to
sleep somewhere out of sight?

522
00:46:34,058 --> 00:46:35,825
I did.

523
00:46:35,827 --> 00:46:38,060
Let me take you
to our sleeping quarters.

524
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,830
And at night...

525
00:46:41,733 --> 00:46:44,901
we are going to sleep in here.

526
00:46:50,441 --> 00:46:52,175
Ta-da.

527
00:46:52,177 --> 00:46:54,577
[Alec] You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

528
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:56,045
I'm not.

529
00:46:56,948 --> 00:46:58,014
[Alec sighs]

530
00:46:58,016 --> 00:46:59,215
[camera beeps]

531
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:01,851
Okay.

532
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:06,422
Okay.

533
00:47:06,424 --> 00:47:08,424
So,

534
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:12,795
I should probably tell you a little
bit about what we're doing. Um...

535
00:47:12,797 --> 00:47:16,999
So this is a documentary.
Yeah. Um...

536
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:23,472
It's to give you all a look at how a
professional phrog goes about phrogging.

537
00:47:23,474 --> 00:47:25,308
They call us phrogs
with a "P-H"

538
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:28,444
because we hop
from pad to pad

539
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:31,314
undetected by the people
who actually live in the house.

540
00:47:31,316 --> 00:47:34,851
Usually I try to stay in a place for no
longer than, like, four or five days

541
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:37,019
'cause it makes it harder
to be discovered.

542
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:39,555
For the most part, I really try to disrupt
their lives as little as possible.

543
00:47:39,557 --> 00:47:42,558
Oh, and it's a good thing that
these people have a guest room.

544
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,660
That's what you wanna look for.

545
00:47:44,662 --> 00:47:48,731
A room that is rarely used by the
family that you can make headquarters.

546
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:50,299
As you can see,

547
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:52,368
I'm eating some of their food.

548
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,537
Um, this is allowed
because, you know,

549
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:57,506
um... a girl's gotta eat.

550
00:47:57,508 --> 00:47:59,976
We just try not to take
too much of one thing.

551
00:47:59,978 --> 00:48:01,677
[shrieks]
[laughing]

552
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:03,746
You asshole!
Alec!

553
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:10,720
This disturbing creature is my cameraman,
Alec. [laughing]

554
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:12,755
I can't believe you brought
this creepy thing with you.

555
00:48:12,757 --> 00:48:14,323
What? It's fitting.
We're phrogs.

556
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:16,025
It's a frog.
You're such a freak.

557
00:48:16,027 --> 00:48:19,562
He has never done this before,
so I'm showing him the ropes

558
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:22,665
while he documents
with his nifty camera.

559
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:24,066
Oh, I also let him
pick out this house.

560
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:26,035
And I sure know how
to pick 'em, huh?

561
00:48:26,037 --> 00:48:27,670
So far, so good.

562
00:48:27,672 --> 00:48:29,338
This is
the best part of the day.

563
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,274
We get to be loud,
and we have the house to ourselves

564
00:48:31,276 --> 00:48:32,909
and we can
move about freely.

565
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:34,377
But when they come home,

566
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:36,779
we have to stick
to our hiding places

567
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:37,947
and stay quiet.

568
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:40,383
And that part's gonna suck.

569
00:48:40,385 --> 00:48:41,584
Yep.

570
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:43,786
[camera beeps]

571
00:48:47,892 --> 00:48:49,125
[whispering] So...

572
00:48:50,395 --> 00:48:54,430
It is ten minutes
after 2:00 a.m.

573
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:57,233
Alec and I fell asleep,

574
00:48:57,235 --> 00:49:01,370
and the family must've come home
while we were passed out.

575
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:05,541
Alec, are you awake?

576
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:10,212
Alec? Alec?

577
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:12,014
[camera beeps]

578
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:20,890
Alec?

579
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:23,559
What the hell are you doing?

580
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:26,362
[Alec] I was bored.

581
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:30,499
[girl] You can't just go
outside whenever you want.

582
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:33,970
[Alec] He just got home.

583
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:35,371
[girl] Who?

584
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:38,207
[Alec] The husband.

585
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:40,176
[girl] Did he see you?

586
00:49:41,446 --> 00:49:43,512
[Alec] Yeah, I mean,
he saw me. He waved.

587
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:45,815
[girl] Okay, very funny.
Come on. Get back inside.

588
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,596
[camera beeps]

589
00:50:03,034 --> 00:50:04,934
[Alec] Sweet dreams.

590
00:50:09,874 --> 00:50:11,841
And here we go.

591
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:05,728
[snores]

592
00:51:24,282 --> 00:51:26,315
[static crackles]

593
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:35,925
[knife clinks]
[sizzling]

594
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:44,800
[Jackie] We're gonna be late.

595
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:03,919
[girl] Hey, are you insane?

596
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:05,921
You trying to set off
a smoke alarm?

597
00:52:05,923 --> 00:52:08,591
Yes.
Stay away from the window.

598
00:52:08,593 --> 00:52:11,327
God, who knew this phrogging thing would
give you such a stick up your ass?

599
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:13,829
Shh! Hushed voices.

600
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:15,331
Sorry.

601
00:52:20,505 --> 00:52:23,005
Dude, I don't think you
understand how dangerous this is.

602
00:52:23,007 --> 00:52:26,408
We could go to jail. We're breaking
so many laws just by being here.

603
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:28,010
I do understand.

604
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:31,247
But isn't that part of the fun,
almost getting caught?

605
00:52:31,249 --> 00:52:33,883
No, the fun is to not come
close to getting caught.

606
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:46,829
Wanna play the word game?

607
00:52:50,101 --> 00:52:52,134
What is it with you
and that word game?

608
00:52:52,136 --> 00:52:53,836
Something to fucking do.

609
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:56,705
Okay, you're the one who's been
hounding me to come along.

610
00:52:56,707 --> 00:52:58,541
I was perfectly happy
doing this alone.

611
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,044
I know.

612
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,813
I'm glad to.

613
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:07,516
I just thought it
would be a little more...

614
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:09,885
less shit.

615
00:53:09,887 --> 00:53:12,421
[giggling]

616
00:53:13,991 --> 00:53:16,625
It's better than...
[phone ringing]

617
00:53:16,627 --> 00:53:18,727
...subways and park benches.

618

[phone ringing]

619
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:24,633
Just about.

620
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:36,478
Okay.

621
00:53:38,316 --> 00:53:40,616
I'm thinking of a...

622
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,686
seven-letter word.

623
00:53:43,688 --> 00:53:45,221
It starts with a "B."

624
00:53:48,192 --> 00:53:50,559
[glass shattering]

625
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:12,915

[gasps]

00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:35,537
[Greg] Jesus Christ, Connor.

630
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:37,106
[Alec] Bastard.

631
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:38,941
What?

632
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:41,210
[Alec] Seven-letter word,
starts with "B."

633
00:55:11,575 --> 00:55:13,342
[girl]
Mission accomplished.

634
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,213
There's so many places
to hide shit down there.

635
00:55:20,117 --> 00:55:22,184
If we need a quick escape,
that's our route.

636
00:55:25,623 --> 00:55:27,423
Check it out.

637
00:55:27,425 --> 00:55:30,192
[man on TV, indistinct]
How'd you do that?

638
00:55:30,194 --> 00:55:31,827
Downloaded an app.

639
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:34,530
They keep their Wi-Fi password
next to the chore chart.

640
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:38,434
You are such a freak.

641
00:55:38,436 --> 00:55:41,370
[man on TV continues,
indistinct]

642
00:55:42,973 --> 00:55:45,207
Wouldn't it be kinda funny
to mess with them?

643
00:55:46,477 --> 00:55:49,445
Take some random shit,
make them think they're going crazy?

644
00:55:49,447 --> 00:55:50,713
No.

645
00:55:51,782 --> 00:55:53,048
It wouldn't.

646
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:55,951
Stop touching stuff, okay?

647
00:55:58,489 --> 00:56:01,390
Can you believe

Just a second!

[Alec] Just let him in.
He doesn't know you don't live here.

656
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:34,423
[repairman] Hi. I got a call
about a broken window.

657

Yeah, that was my dad.

Now!

663
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,486
I'm just a window repairman.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

664
00:57:37,488 --> 00:57:39,988
[Jackie] What're you doing here? [repairman]
Your husband called about a broken window.

665
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:41,623
Just finished
putting in a new one.

666
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,326
No more going downstairs.

Ha-ha. Level 59.

00:57:58,943 --> 00:58:00,676
This is so messed up.

Oh, yeah, Justin.

674
00:58:14,792 --> 00:58:16,458
You know him?

675
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,427
No, Mindy, I kinda stopped
hanging out with ten-year-olds

676
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:19,595
when I was, like, ten.

677
00:58:19,597 --> 00:58:21,997
Okay, yeah.
Fucking hysterical.

Yeah, it does.

00:58:37,314 --> 00:58:38,714
Here's your bottle.

00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,517
Okay.

00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,082
<i>Let's remember the energy.</i>

3
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,050
<i>America had won the war.</i>

4
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,441
<i>The depression was over.</i>

5
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,205
<i>Sacrifice was over.</i>

6
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,090
<i>The upsurge of life was contagious.</i>

7
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,809
<i>We celebrated a moment
of collective inebriation</i>

8
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,042
<i>that we would never know again.</i>

9
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,681
<i>Nothing like it in all the years
that followed</i>

10
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,969
<i>from our childhood
until tonight,</i>

11
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,601
<i>the 45th reunion of our high school class.</i>

12
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,563
<i>At 30 or 40, a gathering
of my old classmates</i>

13
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,645
<i>would have been exactly the kind of thing
I'd have kept my nose out of.</i>

14
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,520
<i>But at 62,
I found myself drawn to it</i>

15
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,683
<i>as if in the crowd
of half-remembered faces</i>

16
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,481
<i>I'd be closer to the mystery
at the heart of things,</i>

17
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,044
<i>a magic trick that turned time past
into time present.</i>

18
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,370
<i>The Swede.</i>

19
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,124
<i>Swede Levov.</i>

20
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,603
<i>During the war years, this was
a magical name in our neighborhood.</i>

21
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,089
<i>Of the few fair-complexioned students
in our predominantly Jewish public school,</i>

22
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,485
<i>none possessed the Viking mask
of this blue-eyed hero, the Swede.</i>

23
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,530
<i>Big brother of my best friend, Jerry,</i>

24
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,162
<i>born into our tribe
as Seymour Irving Levov,</i>

25
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,841
<i>the greatest high school athlete
New Jersey had ever seen.</i>

26
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,244
<i>Watching the Swede, people could forget
the way things actually were.</i>

27
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,163
<i>We could forget the war.</i>

28
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,605
<i>The Swede went off to the Marines in '44,</i>

29
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,684
<i>just missing the end of the fighting,</i>

30
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,770
<i>and came home to Dawn Dwyer,</i>

31
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,526
<i>a plumber's daughter from Elizabeth,
who made it all the way</i>

32
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,645
<i>to the Miss America pageant
in Atlantic City.</i>

33
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,929
<i>A</i> shiksa.
<i>The Swede had done it.</i>

34
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,929
<i>But before he could marry Dawn,
she had one great test to pass;</i>

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,447
<i>She had to meet the old man,
the Swedes father,</i>

36
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,570
<i>Lou Levov, founder and owner
of Newark Maid gloves.</i>

37
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,896
He just wants to ask you
a couple of things, that's all.

38
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,161
"That's all"?
Can't you answer for me?

39
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,050
He wants to get to know you
and he's not an easy guy,

40
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,727
- but if you stand your ground...
- Oh, Swede.

41
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,451
He'll respect that.
He'll respect you for it.

42
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,284
I'll be right there.

43
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,441
<i>Dawn, let's get down
to brass tacks.</i>

44
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,887
What do you people say
about Jews?

45
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,088
My family doesn't talk much
about Jews.

46
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,481
I don't mean that as an excuse.

47
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,131
We don't talk much
about anything.

48
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,282
But marrying a Jew
isn't a big deal.

49
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,290
Until the issue
of what to raise the kids as.

50
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,204
I would want our child
to be baptized, yes.

51
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,489
Baptized? No.
That's a no.

52
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,680
But...

53
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,841
Baptism, it washes away original sin.
Without it, if they die, they go to limbo.

54
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,043
Limbo, I don't know about,
but baptism, I can't allow.

55
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,600
It's important to me,
Mr. Levov.

56
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,364
All of the sacraments
are important.

57
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,727
Like communion, the Eucharist.

58
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,040
What is that?

59
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,569
Well, everybody kneels
and you eat the Body of Christ.

60
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,291
I cannot go that far.
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,691
I have the highest respect,

62
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,890
but my grandchild
is not going to eat Jesus.

63
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,928
- I can give you Christmas.
- What about Easter?

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,002
Easter?
She wants Easter, Seymour.

65
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,731
- What about Catechism?
- No! Whatever that is.

66
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,202
Now, both of you, we have to talk
about the bar mitzvah.

67
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,930
Why can't we just let him decide?

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,764
A child cannot decide.

69
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,285
But I don't want a bar mitzvah.

70
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,776
Then I don't think
we can reach an agreement.

71
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,246
- Dad.
- She wants the child to decide?

72
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,970
A child cannot decide.

73
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,451
Then we won't have a child.

74
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,330
We can marry,
but we won't have children.

75
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,801
Miss Dwyer,
you are as pretty as a picture.

76
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,567
I congratulate you
on how far you've come.

77
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,682
Your parents must be proud.

78
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,845
But I think we should just shake hands
and everybody go their own way.

79
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,163
I'm not leaving.
I'm not going to go.

80
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,811
And I'm not a picture,
Mr. Levov, I'm myself.

81
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,360
I'm Mary Dawn Dwyer
and I love your son.

82
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,884
I love him.
That's why I'm here.

83
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,246
So, please...

84
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,645
Let's go on.

85
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,126
<i>So, the old man was won over.</i>

86
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,326
<i>In a few years, the Swede took over
the glove factory, built it up.</i>

87
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,290
<i>He commuted from the home
he and Dawn had made together</i>

88
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,408
<i>30 miles west of Newark,</i>

89
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,485
<i>out past the suburbs
in wealthy Old Rimrock,</i>

90
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,847
<i>where they were raising
the child they had,</i>

91
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,524
<i>a daughter, Merry.</i>

92
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,527
Count! Where are you?

93
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,651
Count!

94
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,648
I hear him.

95
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,328
Count! We're here!
Count!

96
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,890
Come on, Count.

97
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,842
Penny, Russ, how are you doing?

98
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,216
- How's the family, Mr. Levov?
- Real good, thanks.

99
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,925
- You two have a good rest of your day.
- You, too, Mr. Levov.

100
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,245
<i>Something was
smiling down on him.</i>

101
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,164
<i>This is the way I thought
it would always be.</i>

102
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,480
Daddy!

103
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,202
<i>Life would open its arms
and he would carry all before him.</i>

104
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,045
<i>He was the Swede, after all.</i>

105
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,090
- Hey,
- Hey.

106
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,360
<i>♪ Won't you play the music
so the cradle can rock ♪</i>

107
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,571
<i>♪ To a lullaby in ragtime ♪</i>

108
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,202
<i>♪ Sleepy hands are creeping

109
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,886
<i>♪ Play a lullaby in ragtime... ♪</i>

110
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,485
Jerry Levov.

111
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,962
God, Nathan!
I didn't expect to see you here.

112
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,169
Well, I didn't expect
to see you either...

113
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,483
I was sure you'd find all this
sentimentality repellent.

114
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,800
Yeah, I do.

115
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,163
This nostalgia. Bullshit.

116
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,323
- You wanna find a spot?
- Sure.

117
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,084
So, why did you come?

118
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,211
Well, of all the forms
of bullshit available,

119
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,602
this was the most likely
to have unsettling surprises.

120
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,684
And you like
unsettling surprises?

121
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,524
...I suppose I do.

122
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,883
Hey, did you see that display
they have for your brother?

123
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,925
Like I said,
I'm not one for nostalgia.

124
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,921
We were... I don't know,
we were probably ten,

125
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,328
and we went to watch
one of his practices.

126
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,564
He ran the ball and his teammates
took him down and they piled on.

127
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,325
And we were worried
for a second, you and I.

128
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,085
Worried about the Swede?
No, never.

129
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,482
No, we were,
because they took him down hard.

130
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,321
But he popped up
and dusted himself off.

131
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,722
And as he trotted by,
he turned, uh...

132
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,848
he turned to me,
his brother's friend.

133
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,651
I mean, I was a nobody,
and he said...

134
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,405
"Basketball was never like this, Skip."

135
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,242
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
He called me Skip.

136
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,684
My brother's dead.

137
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,762
That's why I, uh, came up from Florida,
for his funeral.

138
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,641
Not for this reunion thing.

139
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,680
The... the Swede is...

140
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,489
Just a sweetheart whose fate

141
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,404
was to get himself fucked over
by some real crazies.

142
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,847
My brother, the best you're
going to get in this country,

143
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,729
got caught in a war
he didn't start.

144
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,882
Jerry...

145
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,760
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

146
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,970
No? You don't know?
Were you alive during the '60s?

147
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,169
Well, I wasn't here.
I was... you know...

148
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,084
I was out of country
for most of the '60s.

149
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,126
Oh, I guess you're
the last person to hear, huh?

150
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,602
The famous writer,
the last one to hear the big story.

151
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,520
What is it, then,
th... this big story?

152
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,450
Well, you know he and Dawn had a kid.

153
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,291
You wrote to me
after she was born.

154
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,762
Adorable when she was little.
So, she had a stutter, that was nothing.

155
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,251
To hell with that.

156
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,244
But then Merry got older
and when she did...

157
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,564
I told him. I told him,
"Let her go.

158
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,247
Otherwise, it will rot your gut
and take your life, too."

159
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,846
But... he couldn't.

160
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,567
And now I'm burying my brother.

161
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,416
She was a good kid...

162
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,091
<i>Jerry was correct.</i>

163
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,686
<i>Here I was, the famous writer,</i>

164
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,883
<i>the last one to know the story.</i>

165
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,440
<i>But now I wanted all of it.</i>

166
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,205
<i>I wanted to hear what had become
of the young man</i>

167
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,124
<i>from whom we had expected everything.</i>

168
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,284
<i>Our hero.</i>

169
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,805
<i>Our Kennedy.</i>

170
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,650
Grandpa.

171
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,642
- Grandpa.
- Yes, Merry, what?

172
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,123
Lady Jane's going to have
a calf, grandpa.

173
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,531
I hope it's a heifer.

174
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,444
What's a heifer, sweetheart?
You're talking to a guy from Newark.

175
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,000
It's a girl, grandpa.

176
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,445
Oh. a girl!

177
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,364
I bet it's going to look just like Count.

178
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,843
That's who mounted her.

179
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,003
"Mounted"? ls that a way
for a young girl to talk?

180
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,650
That's what it's called, Dad.

181
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,040
Yeah, what's she supposed to say?

182
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,764
"Make love"? It's a cow.

183
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,922
And what does my son
need with cows?

184
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,765
Why do they need to live this far
from civilization?

185
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,811
No offense to the locals, Mr. Orcutt,
Mrs. Orcutt, but let's be candid.

186
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,167
This is all rock-ribbed
Republican out here.

187
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,442
- That's true. That's so.
- Lou, don't start.

188
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,521
What did I say?

189
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,160
We're out in the middle of nowhere.
This is Ku Klux Klan country.

190
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,645
Dad, will you stop?

191
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,803
I don't see why my brother wants
to live here either,

192
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,087
but a couple of cows
doesn't make it Mississippi.

193
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,606
- This is Morris County.
- Grandpa!

194
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,205
Jerry's right, Dad.

195
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,123
No one thinks like you anymore.

196
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,568
We can live where we want.
This is America.

197
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,371
- Newark is in America.
- Grandpa!

198
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,488
Yes, darling.
What? Yes, sweetheart.

199
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,762
Come to the barn to see Count.

200
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,968
Wait till you meet him.
He's so...

201
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,005
<i>I adore Merry.</i>

202
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,003
I think she's very special.

203
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,525
- Thank you.
- We all do.

204
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,364
She likes coming here.
She told us that.

205
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,965
Very much.

206
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,805
Sometimes when
she's here, I ask her,

207
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,726
"Merry, what terrible thing
do you think would happen

208
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,962
if you stopped stuttering?

209
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,840
How do you think your father
or your mother would feel if you stopped?"

210
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,649
But she can't stop.

211
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,367
I think Merry's stuttering
is a strategy.

212
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,210
A strategy for what?

213
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,891
For avoiding competition
with the beautiful mother,

214
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,248
the beautiful
Miss New Jersey mother,

215
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,369
for winning the handsome father.

216
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,090
This is about our looks?

217
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,083
- Doctor...
- Sheila.

218
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,085
Sheila, stuttering isn't
something that Merry chooses.

219
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,685
It makes her suffer.

220
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,843
Maybe the benefits
outweigh the suffering.

221
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,651
But it's killing us to see her.
It's killing Merry's mother.

222
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,683
Maybe that's one
of the benefits.

223
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,129
Have you thought about how difficult
it must be for Merry

224
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,727
growing up the daughter of someone
who's had so much attention

225
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,451
for something as trivial as beauty?

226
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:03,731
Maybe the reason Merry stutters
is to stop people from asking her,

227
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,885
"Do you want to be Miss New Jersey
just like your Mommy?"

228
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,281
But who asks her that?
Nobody asks her that.

229
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,206
I'm not Miss New Jersey,
for God's sake. I'm her mother.

230
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,241
It's just that in a highly-pressured
perfectionist family, you...

231
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,368
Who says we're
a highly-perfectionist family?

232
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,010
We're an ordinary family.

233
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,402
What about the physiological basis
for her stuttering?

234
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,130
I read an article where...

235
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,931
I can give you organic theories
if that's what you want,

236
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,800
but that's not the way I've found
I can be most effective.

237
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,565
Ouch. Ouch.

238
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,563
I told you to wear your shoes.

239
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,601
You didn't tell me
about how sharp the rocks would be.

240
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,601
No!

241
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,886
Dad!

242
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,567
Do I look... look like
Audrey Hepburn?

243
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,884
Better. You look like
Meredith Levov.

244
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,411
Do you...

245
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,611
- miss Mother?
- Sure I do.

246
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,090
Me, too.

247
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,242
She wanted to come.
She couldn't.

248
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,845
I... I know.

249
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,367
Lady Jane's going to have her calf
any day now. Mom had to be there.

250
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,523
- Yes, Dad. I know.
- She'll come next time.

251
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,847
Have you had a nice time here?

252
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,766
With you?

253
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,686
Terrible.

254
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,769

Hold these for your mother.

261
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,410
Daddy...

262
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,045
Kiss me.

263
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,526
No.

264
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,366
Really, really kiss me.

265
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,440
Kiss me the way you kiss mother.

266
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,249
No!

267
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,444
And fix your dress.

268
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,964
Oh, I'm sorry, Cookie.

269
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,962
Oh, I deserve it.

270
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,964
It's the same at school
with my friends.

271
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,486
I get started with
something and I go...

272
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,326
...too far
and I get carried aw...

273
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,840
There's nothing wrong
with that little girl.

274
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,486
Her mind goes too fast
for her tongue. That's all.

275
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,136
There, I just saved you the money
you were going to give to the shrink,

276
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,243
- because that's all there is to it.
- We just want to help her, Dad.

277
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,416
"Help"? That girl?
Just give her a little bit of time.

278
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,081
Let her tongue catch up to that brain.
The rest will follow from that.

279
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,049
Freddy, is something up
with this machine?

280
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,531
Every now and then, she kicks.

281
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,490
No, no, no. You'll be throwing stitches
soon. Send it down to the shop.

282
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,971
See my son, Vick?

283
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,725
He picks out the bad machine from 100.
He's got the ear.

284
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,763
He gets it from you, Lou.

285
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,286
How are you feeling, Dad?

286
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,568
You don't have to come in every day.

287
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,371
Who comes in every day?
I don't.

288
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,450
Besides, where else am I supposed to go?

289
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,681
- Time cards, gentlemen.
- Thank you, Vicky.

290
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,367
Vicky, my son is trying to tell me never
to come around here anymore.

291
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,603
I didn't say "anymore,"
I said "not every day."

292
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,808
But, Lou, you built this place.

293
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,248
You made a home for all of us.
Where else do you belong?

294
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,322
Exactly my point.

295
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,209
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

296
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,001
- You finish your stuttering book?
- Mm-hmm.

297
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,526
Have you written down
all the words that stopped you today?

298
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,240
D... do you want to check?

299
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,169
Not if you say you finished.

300
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,081
My teacher in school never believes me
unless she checks.

301
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,807
Well, your teacher says that you have
a stubborn streak.

302
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,930
Merry, why does she say that?

303
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,049
Because of the homework.

304
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,523
The class had to write an answer
to the question "Why are we here?"

305
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,604
- and Merry wrote...
- Merry can tell me herself.

306
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,051
Sorry.

307
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,011
"Why are apes here?"

308
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,767
That's it?

309
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,126
She made her rewrite it.

310
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,685
So I wrote...

311
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,125
"Why are...

312
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,330
kangaroos here?"

313
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,165
And then last week,

314
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,561
the teacher asked them,
"What is life?"

315
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,802
This is what they ask in school?

316
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,247
"What is life?"
What did you answer?

317
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,604
I don't...

318
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,889
- remember.
- Yes, you do.

319
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,807
"Life is just a short space of time

320
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,043
in which you were alive."

321
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,485
Daddy,

322
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,167
do you understand?

323
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,851
Yes, I think I do.

324
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,843
<i>He assumed the lotus posture</i>

325
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,811
<i>and another priest stepped forward
and poured gasoline over him.</i>

326
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,087
<i>- A very frail, old man in his 70s,
- Oh, my God.</i>

327
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,401
<i>- Quang Duc.
- What is this?</i>

328
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,802
<i>This monk burned himself
and he sat there.</i>

329
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,451
- Oh, Merry shouldn't be seeing this.
- No.

330
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,965
<i>And then suddenly, a towering flame</i>

331
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:31,490
<i>and the smell of gasoline and of burning
flesh in the air for ten minutes.</i>

332
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,844
<i>And the priests and the nuns in the
audience moaned and prostrated them...</i>

333
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,568
Why did that poor...

334
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,883
why did that poor man
have to burn himself?

335
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,404
Hey.

336
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,246
That gentle man and
those gentle people.

337
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,324
It's far away, baby.
It's far away.

338
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,560
- Doesn't anybody care?
- Of course people care.

339
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,166
Doesn't anybody...

340
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,926
doesn't anybody
have a conscience?

341
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,800
- Yes, you have a conscience.
- Cookie.

342
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,961
Don't cry. Shh.

343
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,090
- Do they look good, Daddy?
- You've got the touch.

344
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,049
If you don't end up senator
for New Jersey,

345
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,600
you'll make a great short-order cook.

346
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,809
I'd rather cook any day.

347
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,447
Mmm. Great.

348
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,127
This makes you the first Levov in history
who can prepare edible food.

349
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,807
As long as it's hamburgers.

350
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,123
What's wrong with hamburgers?
It's an American classic.

351
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,010
<i>I came hereto speak to you about Vietnam.</i>

352
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,564
Talk about an American classic.

353
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,370
There's an American classic asshole.

354
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,321
<i>We abhor the political murder
of any state by another.</i>

355
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,731
Fucking liar.

356
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,336
He's better than the guy
he ran against.

357
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,886
Barry Goldwater
would have buried us all.

358
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,282
Fucking madman.

359
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,443
Lyndon Baines

360
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,683
"Baby Burner" Johnson.

361
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,684
- What's going on?
- Johnson's press conference.

362
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,242
We don't disagree, Mer.
We're all against the war in this family.

363
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,687
You heartless, miserable prick.

364
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,809
Merry, stop. Please.

365
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,609
What do you care about the war?

366
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,331
You're just contented,
middle-class people.

367
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,731
Some people would be very happy

368
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,848
to have contented,
middle-class people for parents.

369
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,321
Well, I'm not brainwashed
enough to be one of them.

370
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,765
Merry. Dawn.

371
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,401
What? Don't tell me. Tell her.

372
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,086
Tell her to behave
like a civilized person.

373
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,640
- Don't tell me what to do.
- I'm your mother.

374
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,688
I can and I will
tell you what to do.

375
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,406
- I'm turning this off.
- Sure, turn it off.

376
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,290
The Democratic Republic of Hanoi

377
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,362
could just burn down

378
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,046
and Mom would just go on
worrying about her cows.

379
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,400
- Merry...
- Don't touch me, Dad.

380
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,805
I can't stand this.

381
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,565
You're not anti-war,
you're anti-everything.

382
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,324
And you're pro...

383
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,090
COW.

384
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,405
I don't know why
she's turned against me.

385
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,087
Is it her stuttering?

386
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,561
Is she angry because
she can't make friends?

387
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,405
She's made friends, all right?
The ones she's made in New York.

388
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,682
Who is she?

389
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,160
I thought she was smart.

390
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,242
She's becoming stupid, Seymour.

391
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,325
No. She's just a kid with a strong will,
a strong idea.

392
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,649
- It's not very well worked out...
- You're defending her. She hates me.

393
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,449
Dawn.

394
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,161
She talks to me like...
I don't know what.

395
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,091
With no respect.

396
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,009
And if I ever spoke
to my mother like that,

397
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,282
do you know what my father
would have done?

398
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,250
He would have turned you
over his knee.

399
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,970
You think it's funny?

400
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,368
I have to pick her up
from the train.

401
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,201
I can't believe we let her go to New York.

402
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,403
She's 16, Seymour.

403
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,485
We don't even know who she's with.
We don't know who her friends are.

404
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,769
Well, she likes them, they like her.
That's what's important.

405
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,161
I don't like those pamphlets
they give her.

406
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,925
What pamphlets?

407
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,483
In her room, Seymour.

408
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,165
<i>Police
and fire departments are on the alert</i>

409
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,846
<i>as negro demonstrators
take to the streets of Newark</i>

410
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,891
<i>after the arrest and alleged beating
of cab driver John W. Smith.</i>

411
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,042
You were supposed
to be on the 8:00 o'clock.

412
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,528
You were involved in something there,
something political.

413
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,049
Everything is political.
Brushing your teeth is political.

414
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,886
People who are against the war.
ls that who you see?

415
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,248
They're just people
who don't believe in the war.

416
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,529
- I don't believe in the war myself.
- Then what's your problem?

417
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,096
I don't want you getting mixed up
in things

418
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,849
that could hurt your chances
for college.

419
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,321
My friends have been to college.

420
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,449
They had to leave because of the way
they treat student protestors.

421
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:17,242
Is that who they are?
College kids who have gotten thrown out?

422
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,927
They're just my friends.

423
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,561
Can't you believe that I have friends?
Don't you believe that?

424
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,603
Of course I believe you have friends.

425
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,160
They wanted me to stay the night.

426
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,765
No. That's...

427
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,760
You can never even think about staying
over with people that we don't know

428
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,406
or you'll never be
allowed to go again.

429
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,007
What do you believe in, Daddy?

430
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,287
This is not about politics.

431
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,887
My responsibility is to you,
not the war.

432
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,724
Oh, I know.

433
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,690
That's why I have to go to New York,

434
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,286
because people there
do feel responsible,

435
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,887
responsible for blowing up
Vietnamese villages,

436
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,281
blowing up little babies.

437
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,442
But you don't care.

438
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,921
And neither does Mother.

439
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,561
No one in our family
or in our fucking little town does.

440
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,206
Sir, could you go
to your vehicle?

441
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,886
You need to get off the street.
There's a curfew in effect.

442
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,291
"Curfew"?

443
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,523
- What kind of fascist bullshit is that?
- Merry!

444
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,127
We've got enough trouble tonight.
The curfew's to protect people.

445
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,690
From what?
They should riot.

446
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,570
I'm sorry, officer.
We... we're both sorry.

447
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,768
I am not fucking sorry.

448
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,764
She's 16. You got any at home,
you'll understand.

449
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,171
I don't.

450
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,646
Right.

451
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,376
<i>Hundreds of protestors
have gathered in the Fourth Precinct</i>

452
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,051
<i>where cab driver John W. Smith
is being held</i>

453
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,842
<i>after allegedly being beaten by police,
who are calling this an isolated incident.</i>

454
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,402
<i>Yet some local residents
are urging violent retaliation.</i>

455
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,202
<i>More news as it comes in.
And now, back to our regular programming.</i>

456
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,605
Get on out of here!

457
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,176
- Streets to the people.
- Power to the people!

458
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,964
Get the fuck back home now!

459
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,289
Black power! Black power! Black power!

460
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,600
- Black power!
- Get out of here!

461
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,085
Jesus, Merry!

462
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,770
Your father called from Florida.

463
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,536
He wants to know
if they've come near the factory.

464
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,891
I'll see in the morning.

465
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,203
You're not going to work tomorrow,
not with the riot going on.

466
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,726
It's not a riot.

467
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,529
It's a revolution.

468
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,728
People standing up for their rights.

469
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,016
If you're going to defend them,
maybe you should just join them.

470
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,451
That's a good idea.

471
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,682
The governor called
the National Guard in.

472
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,603
Of course. I mean,
what else can he do?

473
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,891
He can treat black people
like human beings, that's what.

474
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,009
No blacks on the city council,
the poverty, the unemployment.

475
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,243
We have 80% negroes working at the plant.
We're proud of that.

476
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,448
Oh, I forgot.

477
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,930
You're a hero.

478
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,085
- Hello?
- Seymour.

479
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,531
- Vicky.
- <i>It's bad.</i>

480
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,601
What is it?

481
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,201
I ain't never seen anything this bad.

482
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,521
They're beating 'em and dragging...
Oh, my God.

483
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,204
Sniper!

484
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,961
- Vicky.
- People are shooting.

485
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,168
Police are shooting,
and soldiers.

486
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,722
People have lost their minds.

487
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,851
Thank you.

488
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,571
Thank you, sir.

489
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,450
- Going to war, huh?
- It's what it is.

490
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,966
No. It isn't, either.

491
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,441
These are just troublemakers,
so think.

492
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,649
What we're saying is,
you're hereto keep the peace, son.

493
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,644
That means protecting the people
and the property of this neighborhood.

494
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,768
What I'm saying is to think.

495
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,162
Think before you start shooting
at somebody's window.

496
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,288
- Vicky.
- These aren't snipers.

497
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,530
These are people,
good people who live around here,

498
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,046
people just like your own mothers
and fathers.

499
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,361
That's who lives up there.

500
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,886
Now, this is their home.

501
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,931
And they've got to live here
long after you're gone.

502
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,921
This is <i>their</i> home.
Not yours.

503
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,005
All right. Well done.

504
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,776
I'm just telling them how it is,
that's all.

505
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,883
But tonight is going to be bad.
Do you hear me?

506
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,566
So, go home. Take everybody
who came to work and go home.

507
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,051
You're staying, though.

508
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,929
There ain't no telling
how bad it's going get.

509
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,651
Won't be safe for anybody,
and not you.

510
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,087
The place will be safer
with someone inside.

511
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,969
Then I'll stay, too.

512
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,096
- I've got that.
- No, I'll put it.

513
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,804
- Vicky.
- They're shootin' outside...

514
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,291
I got it.

515
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,290
Are you talking to me?

516
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,365
I told you not to move!
Keep your people back!

517
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,170
What do you want?

518
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,924
Turn it down.

519
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,202
All dressed up for your stupid...

520
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,603
...award that they gave you?

521
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,328
You expect me to...

522
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,484
congratulate you, too?

523
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,283
What was the award for anyway?

524
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,806
We didn't shut down
after the riots.

525
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,136
The people who worked there,
who have always worked there,

526
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,889
were welcomed back
to their jobs.

527
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,485
The mayor thought that
that was good,

528
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,376
that other businesses
should have done the same.

529
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,562
There was a ceremony in his office.

530
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,330
Congratulations...

531
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,644
Swede.

532
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,722
And I would have liked it
if you had come.

533
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,131
I would have...

534
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,084
fucking hated it.

535
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,847
Have you thought about
what I asked you?

536
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,369
Going away to private school?

537
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,249
If you don't like
living here with us.

538
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,848
I just want to be able to go to New York
again on the weekends.

539
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,766
No. You didn't come home last time.
You knew the rules.

540
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,129
I never thought my own father
would keep me prisoner.

541
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,089
Merry.

542
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,804
I have an idea for you.

543
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,488
I've been thinking
and I have an idea.

544
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,561
You want to protest the war.

545
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,166
Protest it right here in Old Rimrock.

546
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,527
What am I going to do,
march around the post office?

547
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,126
"Bring the war home."
Isn't that the slogan?

548
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,771
Look, they gave me this award.

549
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,882
It's just a stupid plaque,
but it means one thing.

550
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,123
If you take a stand, people notice.

551
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,966
If you oppose the war right here
with all your strength...

552
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,361
This is part of America too, you know.

553
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,680
Read Marx.

554
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,481
Revolutions don't begin
in the countryside.

555
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,406
- We're not talking about revolution.
- You're not talking about revolution.

556
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,041
You think about what I'm saying.

557
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,451
I'm sure she's just with her friends
in New York.

558
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,443
Should we call the police?

559
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,921
No, let's give her some more time.

560
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,640
Swede...

561
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,970
do you think...

562
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,124
the post office...

563
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,409
- Do you think Merry...
- No.

564
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,245
It's not possible.

565
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,164
You told her to bring the war home.

566
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,242
Well, that was just talk.

567
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,531
I hope so.

568
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,362
A warrant. How many lies
did you tell to get that?

569
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,456
We have an informant that confirms that
your daughter and another young woman

570
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,164
placed a bomb in the post office.

571
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,924
An informant?
Who is this informant?

572
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,976
Does your daughter know Russ Hamlin,
the Storekeeper?

573
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,411
We all know Russ, Penny.

574
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,845
Do you know Russ Hamlin is dead?

575
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,445
I know it because it was on the radio.

576
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,921
- It has nothing to do with...
- Hey, hey, hey.

577
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,530
Open that up.

578
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,442
What does my daughter
know about dynamite?

579
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,648
- Mrs. Levov.
- This is a girl.

580
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,643
This is a high school girl.

581
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,849
She didn't make a bomb.
She doesn't even know what a bomb is.

582
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,329
How could you even think that she could
make a bomb or... or kill somebody?

583
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,246
- Where is she, Mrs. Levov?
- I don't know.

584
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,489
- She's been tricked.
- Mm-hmm.

585
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,846
She's been tricked!

586
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,481
Why does everybody say that she did it
when she couldn't have done it?

587
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,484
She's been tricked and abducted.

588
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,642
Somebody is brainwashing her
right now.

589
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,296
- We need to find her, Mrs...
- She doesn't have anything to do with it!

590
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,456
My daughter could not have had
anything to do with this!

591
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,606
Then why did she run off?

592
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,336
Maybe she doesn't even know
you're looking for her.

593
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,045
You know that they've probably taken her
underground already, right?

594
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,976
- Seymour.
- It's all right, Dawnie. Who's "they"?

595
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,049
You said she has political friends
in New York.

596
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,010
"We are against everything
decent in America.

597
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,162
We will loot and burn"
and on and on and on.

598
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,536
All right, that's written on a wall.

599
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,216
That's probably written
on a lot of kids' walls.

600
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,847
Not in Old Rimrock it's not.
Not in...

601
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,526
"our fucking little town."

602
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,936
What is that?
What are you reading?

603
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,611
- Your daughter stutters?
- Oh, my God.

604
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,569
What does that have
to do with anything?

605
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,325
A police officer in Newark
made a note about it two months ago.

606
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,841
- You were present, sir.
- Oh, for Christ's sake. That?

607
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,289
Yeah, that. That and a couple questions
raised by her teachers.

608
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,930
Come on. Swede!

609
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,844
We're the family,
that's who we are.

610
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,048
They have a right to be here.
They're my family.

611
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,400
- Seymour.
- Mom.

612
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,086
- Our beautiful little girl.
- I know. Dad.

613
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,209
How could this be? Would you tell me
how this thing could be?

614
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,566
Lou?

615
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,688
Make them stop.

616
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,486
They keep saying that Merry did this.
Make them stop saying it.

617
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,007
- Not Merry. Nobody knows if she did it.
- That's right. Nobody knows.

618
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,082
Let them talk.
You're the mother.

619
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,491
She's just a little girl.

620
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,608
Maybe not so little anymore.

621
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,887
- Tell them, Lou.
- I will. I will.

622
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,486
It'll be all right.
It's going to be fine.

623
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:44,771
- You going to be all right?
- We said we'd do this.

624
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,325
Let's do it.

625
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,405
Penny...

626
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,206
We got the news
like everyone else, like you.

627
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,962
We're sorry.

628
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,408
Dawn and I, we're sorry for you,

629
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,807
your son, your children,

630
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,407
sorry for this t... terrible thing,
this terrible, awful...

631
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,241
Whatever happened...

632
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:23,769
whatever Merry did or did not do,
all I'm saying is, I blame myself.

633
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,365
Mrs. Hamlin...

634
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,524
Penny.

635
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,410
I don't know if you can understand,
b... because Merry...

636
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,602
Well...

637
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,688
This is hard to say,
but if Merry did this,

638
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,650
and I understand that's the way it seems,
then it's myself I blame.

639
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,610
Because I did
what I thought is right.

640
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,923
I... I raised her the way I thought best.

641
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,527
I mean, you're a parent, Penny.

642
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,682
My God, you know how hard it is!

643
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,688
And then, things come up with kids,
from inside them, someplace inside.

644
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,124
How can you know what to do?

645
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,761
You try.
You love them.

646
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,763
And I still love my daughter ri...

647
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,403
Maybe I shouldn't be saying this, but...

648
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,650
I love her right now more than ever.

649
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,526
- I hurt for her more now...
- I don't blame you...

650
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,931
Mr. Levov.

651
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,401
I don't blame either one of you.

652
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,166
You didn't go out and buy the dynamite
and make the bomb.

653
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,924
You didn't plant the bomb.

654
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,808
I feel badly for you both.

655
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:48,602
The two of you are as much victims
of this tragedy as we are.

656
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,003
I lost a husband.

657
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,403
My kids lost a father.

658
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,484
But the difference is that, for us...

659
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:08,120
we will survive as a family,

660
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,407
a loving family.

661
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:14,730
We will survive
with our memories intact...

662
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,607
and our memories to sustain us.

663
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,810
We are the same family we were
when Russ was here.

664
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,802
And we will survive.

665
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,763
That's the difference.

666
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,656
<i>Police have widened their search</i>

Meredith Levov,</i>

669
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,530
Where is she?

670
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,120
Swede.

671
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,800
Dawnie.

672
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,887
I want her to come home now.

673
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,405
Right now.

674
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,086
Now.

675
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,764
Now.

676
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,689
- Now. Now.
- Precious.

677
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,966
Now.

678
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,809
There were three blasts.

679
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,760
The townhouse is totally destroyed.
If there was anybody else in there...

680
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,136
But the two women who escaped,
they're young, they're white.

681
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,447
- "Is one of them Merry?"
- Why not? Why couldn't it be?

682
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,289
Mr. Levov, it's been over a year.

683
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,966
Look, the bombs they were building
in the townhouse,

684
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,416
they were pipes filled with dynamite.

685
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,761
Well, the bomb that blew up Hamlins,
that's what it was.

686
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,569
It was a pipe
filled with dynamite.

687
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,007
One of the missing women,
we know who she is.

688
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,570
Her parents own the building.

689
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,449
They're down in the Caribbean
growing a tan

690
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,444
while their rich-fuck daughter's making
bombs to blow people up with.

691
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,729
But the other girl, you don't know
the identity of the other girl.

692
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,131
And therefore it's Merry?

693
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,250
Go home, Mr. Levov.

694
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,084
This is my daughter.

695
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,889
We'll tell you.
All right, Mr. Levov?

696
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,736
No, you won't.
You're not telling us anything.

697
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,161
And for Christ's sake,
stop tapping our phone.

698
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,920
There's... there's nothing.

699
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,924
All right? There's one thing.
It was nothing.

700
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,365
What?

701
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,810
Someone said they saw her
at the train station.

702
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,928
- Here in Newark?
- It didn't make any sense.

703
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,128
We thought she'd be
halfway across the country.

704
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,925
We worked it.
It went nowhere.

705
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,809
This was months ago.

706

"Rita Cohen."

710
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,522
From the Wharton School of Business.

711
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,843
I'm doing my thesis on the leather glove
industry here in Newark.

712
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,127
I'd be grateful for anything
you could teach me.

713
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,760
Mm-hmm.

714
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,650
Go ahead, feel it.

715
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,006
It's sheepskin.

716
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,809
Cabretta.

717
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,370
It's lovely.

718
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,126
They've been shipped from the same ports
in Africa for hundreds of years.

719

You want to learn about gloves?
We'll make you up a pair.

720
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,564
Here? Now?

721
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,085
Here.

722
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,731
I'm guessing you're a four.

723
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,928
Let me see what kind of guesser I am.

724
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,731
Four it is.
That's as small as ladies' come.

725
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,165
Any smaller is a child's.

726
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,171
Harry, make up a four
for this young lady, British tan.

727
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,766
You're witnessing a dying business,
Miss Cohen.

728
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:31,722
- Am I? I'm sorry, I didn't realize.
- Oh, not us. Knock wood.

729
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,083
No, we've still got the big accounts,
Bendel's, Macy's.

730
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,491
No, I meant the whole industry.

731
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,801
Everyone's moving to Hong Kong,
Puerto Rico.

732
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,291
To cut labor costs.

733
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,408
Exactly. Precisely.

734
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,801
Everybody's hurting.

735
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,690
It used to be that a woman owned ten,
12 pairs of gloves.

736
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,091
Imagine that.

737
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,648
These are for you, Miss.

738
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:07,206
Slowly.
Always slowly the first time.

739
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,566
Feel how it expands
when you make a fist.

740
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,320
Thank you.

741
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,046
She wants
her Audrey Hepburn scrapbook.

742
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,281
- Talk to me.
- Not near the house.

743
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,363
Swede, what is it?

744
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,881
Somebody came to me from Merry.

745
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,481
She's all right?
Where is she?

746
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,800
I don't know. I don't know where she is,
but this person,

747
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,922
this little person,
she looked younger than Merry.

748
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,490
She wants to meet me tomorrow.

749
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,562
- Merry?
- No, this Rita person.

750
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,564
She wants me to meet her
in a parking lot downtown.

751
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,130
She gave me all these instructions.

752
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,096
"Drive through the park.
Make sure you're not followed."

753
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,124
The agents.
Are you going to tell the agents?

754
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,647
I don't know.
I don't know what to do, Dawn.

755
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,161
She knew about
the Audrey Hepburn pictures.

756
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,847
She knew about the stuttering books,
the ballet classes, the cows.

757
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,605
This girl, she could lead us to Merry.

758
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,520
Where are the cows?

759
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,602
- What?
- The cows, where are they?

760
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,042
I sold them.
I'm selling them.

761
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,043
Why would you sell your cows?

762
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:42,247
You can't tell the agents... Swede.

763
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:46,120
This girl,
just do whatever she says.

764
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,440
Please.

765
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,451
Why are you wearing Merry's coat?

766
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,204
She gave it to me.

767
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,285
Surely, you can...

768
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,681
Surely, you can now tell me something
about Merry.

769
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,451
- I surely cannot.
- I would like to speak with her.

770
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,887
Well, she wouldn't like to speak with you.

771
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,167
She hates you.

772
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,924
Does she?

773
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,724
Thinks you ought to be shot.

774
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,370
Yes? That, too?

775
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,084
Swede Levov.

776
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:55,010
How much do you pay the workers
in your factory in Puerto Rico?

777
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,651
I don't have a factory in Puerto Rico.
I stayed right here.

778
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,848
How much do you pay
the women going blind

779
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,969
stitching gloves for the ladies
at Bendel's and Macy's?

780
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,327
You've seen how unhappy
my employees are.

781
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,323
That's why they've worked for me
for 40 years,

782
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,890
because they're so exploited.

783
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,531
Who are you? You don't even know
what you're talking about.

784
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,206
You own your people.
You own them, you use them,

785
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,016
you sleep with them,
and then when you're done...

786
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:19,283
Please, Rita. I haven't two minutes'
interest in your cliches.

787
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,328
I want you to tell me
where my daughter is.

788
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,576
- That's all I want to hear from you.
- Your daughter never wants

789
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,250
to see you again.

790
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,204
Or that mother.

791
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,089
You don't know anything
about her mother.

792
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,528
Lady Dawn?
Lady Dawn of the manor?

793
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,167
I know all there is to know
about Lady fucking Dawn.

794
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,163
So ashamed of her class origins,

795
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,129
she had to become lady
of the fucking manor

796
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,089
and turn her daughter
into a debutante.

797
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:47,370
"A debutante"? Merry shoveled cow shit
since the age of six.

798
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,728
- She rode tractors, she's 4-H.
- Fake. All fake.

799
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:54,327
The daughter of the beauty queen
and the captain of the football team?

800
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,687
What kind of nightmare
is that for a girl with a soul?

801
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,650
Dawn is not a beauty queen.
She works a farm all day.

802
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,610
Fake, fake. She works a farm
like a fucking upper-class landowner.

803
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,887
"Upper class"?
Her father was a plumber!

804
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,725
Her grandfather was
an Irish milk farmer!

805
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,287
This is crazy!
Where's my daughter?

806
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,365
Somebody is dead.
My daughter is accused of murder!

807
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,091
You're really hung up
on that, aren't you?

808
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,926
Do you know how many Vietnamese have
died in the time we've been talking here?

809
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,570
You give her back to me!

810
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,927
She's not a possession.

811
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,082
You don't own her anymore,

812
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,926
the way you own your factory
and your Buick fucking Electra.

813
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,128
Where is she, Miss Cohen?

814
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,122
So, where is she?

815
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,726
The girl's our link,
our only one.

816
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,690
You let her go? Why?
Why did you let her go?

817
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:52,282
Well, she's just a kid. I know I can work
around her to get to Merry.

818
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,805
That's nonsense.
That's crazy.

819
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,776
You go to the cops.
You go to... what's it, the FBI.

820
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,404
- You tell them everything.
- No. No.

821
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,290
No? Did you get the infant's
phone number, at least?

822
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,806
That's not the plan.
She makes contact with me.

823
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,805
If she feels like it.
If she feels like it. You've got nothing.

824
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,042
- Dr. Levov?
- What? I don't need you.

825
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,360
- But, doctor...
- Just go jump in a lake, nurse, please.

826
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,924
I've got to do this, Jerry.

827
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,650
You should see Dawn these days.

828
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,041
I'm worried about Dawn.
This has to work.

829
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:24,602
Rita has to take us to Merry.
This Rita and the others.

830
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,045
What others?

831
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,771
The ones that have her.
They're controlling her.

832
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,611
If she did this,
if she blew up Hamlins

833
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,206
then these are the people
that made her do it. Don't you see?

834
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,807
"If"? If she blew up Hamlins?
That's what you're asking yourself?

835
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,689
What kind of man are you?

836
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,762
You go to the FBI.
Do you hear me?

837
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,126
No.

838
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,242
And you can't tell
anyone what I told you.

839
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,091
Promise me.

840
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,160
All right.

841
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,730
Good morning, boy.

842
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,530
Do come in.

843
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,284
Make yourself at home.

844
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,485
I brought the money, Miss Cohen.

845
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:42,167
I brought the $10,000 in small bills.
Now, where's my daughter?

846
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:47,521
Come off it, Swede.
You came here to fuck me.

847
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,200
What?

848
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:56,560
Please, Miss, if you have any feeling
for what everyone is going through...

849
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,404
Ask anybody.

850
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,084
Why does
a middle-aged capitalist

851
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,646
come to a hotel room
to meet a young piece of ass?

852
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,204
Say it.

853
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:10,080
Just say it, Swede.
"I came here to fuck you."

854
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,400
Will you stop all this?

855
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,720
I'm 22.

856
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,525
I do everything.

857
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,010
I do it all.

858
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,529
You're not scared, are you?

859
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:26,883
A big guy like you can't have met
your match in little me.

860
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,120
Pillar.

861
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,408
Pillar of the fucking community,
Swede Levov.

862
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,925
Come on, let's see the pillar.

863
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,721
- What is the aim of all this?
- To introduce you to reality.

864
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,485
And it ain't going to be no picnic,
jock-o.

865
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,364
I'll tell you where your daughter is.

866
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,408
First we fuck,

867
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,644
and then I'll zip up your little fly
and take you to where she is.

868
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,121
My daughter has no part in this.

869
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,204
You're not fit to wipe
my daughter's shoes.

870
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,090
She has nothing to do with you
or the bombing.

871
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,606
There.

872
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:11,250
Put it right there.

873
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,328
Do you know what size it is?

874
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,882
Let's see what kind of guesser you are.

875
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,890
I'm guessing it's a four.

876
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,130
In ladies', that's as small as they come.

877
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,208
Stick it in.

878
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:49,205
But slowly,
always slowly the first time.

879
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,407
This has nothing to do with anything.

880
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:55,046
You great, big Boy Scout.

881
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,849
Do you want to know what this has to do
with what's happening?

882
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,045
Taste it.

883
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,563
Taste it and you'll know.

884
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,209
Do you want to know
how it tastes?

885
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:42,404
It tastes like your daughter.

886
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,244
Get out of the street, clown!

887
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,169
What the fuck are you doing?

888
01:03:56,840 --> 01:04:00,003
When you add it up,
your daughter's a minor,

889
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,048
she's seen a psychologist for years.

890
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,088
That's evidence of mental stress.

891
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,448
That bomb, she plainly
had no intent to kill,

892
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,648
not at that hour in the morning.

893
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,326
Protecting her from us
is not intelligent.

894
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,801
It's pretty unintelligent,
if you think about it.

895
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,850
- What is it you want from me?
- Nothing.

896
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:21,286
The description that you gave
of this girl, Rita Cohen,

897
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:24,887
if that's her real name, that's fine,
all right? You can go.

898
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,042
Mrs. Levov know
what happened here today?

899
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:30,044
Yeah, I just called her.
She's disappointed, naturally.

900
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,327
This was our only hope.

901
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,562
You should have called us in
on this, Mr. Levov.

902
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:38,048
You've done everything wrong
you possibly could've.

903
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,645
Since when?

904
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,166
Excuse me?

905
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,846
I've done everything wrong
since when?

906
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:54,205
That's a question you're gonna have
to answer for yourself, Mr. Levov.

907
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,680
Seymour.

908
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,176
- How long ago did she get here?
- I don't know. I didn't see her come in.

909
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,329
She won't let me near her, poor thing,
and I didn't want to scare her.

910
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,084

Don't.

925
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,971
I'm afraid.

926
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,930
I'm frightened.

927
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,489
I'm frightened.
I'm frightened all the time.

928
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,447
It's not time for your medicine.

929
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,046
Dawn. Dawn.

930
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:29,011
Think of the most pleasant place
you've ever been. Hmm?

931
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,602
Um...

932
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:42,443
At the... at the shore, in Avon.

933
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,202
It's my uncle's house and...

934
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,365
I'm a girl.

935
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,646
Come on, lie down.
Come on.

936
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:04,966
And the...

937
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,323
the lifeguards are all...

938
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:15,603
Catholic boys from Fordham
and Holy Cross.

939
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,808
They'd come down for summer.

940
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,848
And they were all in love with you.

941
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:28,122
I should have married one of them.

942
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,765
- See you again tomorrow, Mr. Levov.
- Good night.

943
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,801
<i>At one minute before 1:00 this morning,</i>

944
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,929
<i>the switchboard at the U.S. Capitol
received a phone call.</i>

945
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,607
<i>A man's voice said a bomb would go off
in the building in half an hour.</i>

946
01:07:55,680 --> 01:08:00,049
<i>At 1:30 in the morning, it did,
in a small, unmarked restroom</i>

947
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:02,088
<i>on the ground floor of the Senate side,</i>

948
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,164
<i>next to a barbershop
and near several small offices,</i>

949
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,641
<i>including one
committee hearing room.</i>

950
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:11,645
<i>For a report on the first serious damage
to the nation's foremost structure</i>

951
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:14,166
<i>since the British burned it in 1814,</i>

952
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:18,802
<i>here is congressional correspondent
Lawrence Lawson.</i>

953
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,920
<i>There was alarm for a time
that other bombs</i>

954
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,406
<i>might still be hidden
inside the Capitol.</i>

955
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,450
<i>They're forced to be outlaws
by the way this society is run</i>

956
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,045
<i>and we think they're great.</i>

957
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,416
Across the nation,

958
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:32,364
<i>between January of last year
and April of this year,</i>

959
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:37,002
<i>a total of 4,330 bombings
have been reported.</i>

960
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,416
<i>We're going
to remake this country in the streets.</i>

961
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:42,250
<i>We've got to build a strong base
and someday we've got to knock</i>

962
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:45,608
<i>those motherfuckers who control
this thing right on their ass.</i>

963
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,720
Seymour.

964
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,246
Yeah?

965
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,485
The first time I was in Princeton,
I was at the Governor's mansion.

966
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,528
That's right,
just after the contest.

967
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:19,001
Twenty-one, scared to death.

968
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:26,323
And his chauffeur drove me
from Elizabeth in my crown.

969
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:31,442
I danced in my crown
with the governor of New Jersey...

970
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:36,680
and I ended up here. How?

971
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,444
How did I end up here?

972
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:46,720
You.

973
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,846
You.

974
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,008
You wouldn't leave me alone.

975
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,489
Had to marry me.

976
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,847
I just wanted to teach music.

977
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,043
That's what I wanted.

978
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,844
To teach kids music
in the school system...

979
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,921
and be left alone by boys.

980
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,930
That's it.

981
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:25,803
I never wanted to be
Miss Union County...

982
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:31,370
Miss crazy New Jersey...

983
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,249
Miss America.

984
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,328
I wanted a scholarship.

985
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:48,370
I wanted a degree... a job.

986
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,649
But then you arrived.

987
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,929
You. Those hands.

988
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,051
You wouldn't let me breathe!

989
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:08,367
Every time I looked up,
there's my boyfriend,

990
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:11,649
gaga because I was some
ridiculous beauty queen.

991
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,129
You were like a child.

992
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,128
And you made me a princess.

993
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,404
Look where I wound up.

994
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,604
In a madhouse.

995
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,324
Your princess.

996
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,529
In a madhouse.

997
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,886
Thank you very much.

998
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,610
- Take care.
- Goodbye.

999
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,690
She read a magazine article
about a doctor in Geneva.

1000
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:13,923
- What kind of doctor?
- A plastic surgeon.

1001
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,731
That's all she's talked about
since she came home.

1002
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,165
I see her looking in the mirror.

1003
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,720
<i>She thinks somehow
that by having a facelift,</i>

1004
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,404
<i>even though she's only 43...</i>

1005
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,962
<i>She thinks that it will help her
to start over, and why not?</i>

1006
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,849
<i>Imagine all that Dawn's been through.</i>

1007
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,684
I don't have to imagine.

1008
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:36,449
I've seen this before. Women in trauma,
women who have been ill,

1009
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,887
it can help them
to become a new woman.

1010
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,367
But I want the old Dawn.

1011
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,284
<i>I want my wife and I want Merry.</i>

1012
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,522
<i>We're not talking about Merry.</i>

1013
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,206
<i>But as for Dawn,</i>

1014
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:54,127
what if you were to go along with her,
support her in this,

1015
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:57,761
<i>in the trip to Switzerland,
the operation?</i>

1016
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,684
<i>It could help the both of you
to put the past behind you.</i>

1017
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:03,445
<i>I don't want
to put the past behind.</i>

1018
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:06,524
<i>The past is Merry. There's no way I want
to put that behind.</i>

1019
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,444
<i>But Dawn does.</i>

1020
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,611
What is it?
Can you help me out?

1021
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:25,966
Lou, keep your voice down.

1022
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,610
This is the way
your friend paints?

1023
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,856
You know it is, Dad. You've seen the one
in our living room.

1024
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,326
The one you paid
an arm and a leg for.

1025
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,286
I don't care what you say,
she looks like a million dollars.

1026
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,169
Yeah, all right, Dad.
She looks great.

1027
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,720
"Great"?
The girl's herself again.

1028
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:44,280
Getting rid of those cows
was the smartest thing she ever did.

1029
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,089
I never liked 'em.

1030
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:51,130
But getting that facelift?
I was against it, but I was wrong.

1031
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:57,363
- Darling, a million dollars.
- Thank you, Lou.

1032
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,727
I'm serious, Dawn.
The best money ever spent.

1033
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,325
You seem better.

1034
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:04,006
Lou, Sylvia, you know
Bill and Jesse Orcutt.

1035
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,880
You'll see them at our house
for the barbecue.

1036
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:07,325
I hear you're the artist.

1037
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:10,290
And Bill is helping us on the design
for our new house.

1038
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,805
An artist and an architect.

1039
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,405
Architect's my day job.

1040
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:15,767
Can't make a living just
being an abstract painter.

1041
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,251
No, I should think not.

1042
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:21,928
A glove, everybody understands.
These, you might be the only one.

1043
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:25,325
- I think they're divine, Bill.
- Thanks, Dawn.

1044
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,925
Still, I've got to hand it to anybody

1045
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,004
who's got the guts to wear
that shirt and those pants.

1046
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,010
What? What did I say?

1047
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,651
- Lou. Every time.
- What?

1048
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:46,126
Well, I for one had enough
pretentious art talk for one night.

1049
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:49,010
But you enjoyed yourself.
You had a good time.

1050
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,365
All right, I did.

1051
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:55,122
I'm glad you're
doing so well, Dawn.

1052
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:59,051
I am doing well, aren't I?

1053
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:02,090
I haven't seen you
this happy in a long time.

1054
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,366
Thank you, dear.

1055
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,403
- You drive them home.
- What do you mean?

1056
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,130
- You drive them home.
- Seymour.

1057
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,201
Don't argue.

1058
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,370
I want my daughter.

1059
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,291
If you turn me in, she'll die.
She'll have no one.

1060
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:04,091
- What? What are you talking about?
- Stop.

1061
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:10,928
All right, all right. If you let me go,
I'll tell you where she is.

1062
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,128
You take me. Where is she?
ls she here?

1063
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,328
- You take me there.
- No. I don't want to see her.

1064
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:18,609
- What?
- I can't take it anymore.

1065
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:21,763
You can't take it?
You can't take it?!

1066
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,649
Wait a minute.
She's in Newark?

1067
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:04,170
That's the building.

1068
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,921
Get out of the van.

1069
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,082
- Out.
- All right. All right.

1070
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,800
There's a dog and cat hospital
on the second floor.

1071
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,080
She's got a job there.

1072
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:18,924
But don't go in. Wait for her.

1073
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,288
If you go in, you'll make a scene.
She'll be discovered.

1074
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:25,762
She couldn't handle that.
She'd never survive the FBI.

1075
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,042
Take care of her, Mr. Levov.

1076
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,888
Daddy?

1077
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,930
I'm lonesome.

1078
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,446
Where do you even
get a word like that?

1079
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:00,969
I like it when you hold me.

1080
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,644
Then I'll never let you go.

1081
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:07,166
Ever?

1082
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:08,765
Not ever.

1083
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,320
Merry?

1084
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,526
Daddy.

1085
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:29,322
- You're not stuttering.
- No, I'm not.

1086
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,648
I've become a Jain, Daddy.

1087
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,245
A "Jain"?

1088
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,527
We're a small Indian sect.

1089
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:40,525
I wear the veil to do no harm
to the organisms that dwell in the air.

1090
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:45,006
Merry, this is awful.

1091
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,447
Do you walk this way every night?

1092
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,763
Nor do we bathe,
to do no harm to the water.

1093
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:55,561
We step carefully for fear of crushing
some living object.

1094
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:00,047
There are souls imprisoned
in even the lowest form of life.

1095
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,883
Forgive me, Merry, but...

1096
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:16,529
How can you stand this?

1097
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,244
It's okay, Daddy.

1098
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,044
Really, I'm okay.

1099
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:33,526
You always had things over your bed.

1100
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,807
Used to be pictures
of Audrey Hepburn.

1101
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,843
Those are the five vows.

1102
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,611
"I renounce all killing of living beings,

1103
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:49,321
whether subtle or gross,
moveable or immovable."

1104
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:52,847
"I renounce all vices of lying
speech arising from anger.

1105
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:56,402
I renounce all sexual pleasure
with either Gods or men,

1106
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,006
all taking of anything not given."

1107
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,080
I think you're terrified
of what you've done.

1108
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:06,009
I'm not going to ask what you've done.

1109
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:09,880
I made up my mind. I'm not going
to ask you anything like that.

1110
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,531
But I think that rather than
evade punishment,

1111
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:15,046
you've taken it into your own hands.

1112
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:18,691
It's all right, Daddy.

1113
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:21,923
I can believe that
you can't understand.

1114
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:25,283
I don't believe it's a difficult
conclusion to reach, honey.

1115
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:28,250
I don't think I'm the only person
who, seeing you here,

1116
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,687
would come up with that idea.

1117
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:35,049
You want to do penance,
but this is not penance.

1118
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,487
Not even the state
would punish you like this.

1119
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:38,891
- Daddy.
- No.

1120
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,689
Look at what
you've done to yourself.

1121
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:42,762
You could die if you keep this up.

1122
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,603
But only to be reborn.

1123
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:53,531
Will you at least take off that mask
while we're talking so I can see you?

1124
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,762
See me stutter, do you mean?

1125
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:01,287
My stutter was only my way
of doing no violence to the air.

1126
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,967
Well, maybe you would
have been better off with your stutter

1127
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:09,122
if you had to go this far.

1128
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,290
Where have you been?

1129
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,011
Did you come to Newark
to help me find you?

1130
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:27,323
I got a ride and here I was, you see?

1131
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:32,120
Coincidence? That's all?

1132
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:38,970
The world is not a place on which
I have any influence or wish to have any.

1133
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:44,927
As to what constitutes a coincidence,
you and I, Daddy.

1134
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:48,681
Where have you been all these years?

1135
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:54,086
After Hamlins, I went to Sheila's.

1136
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:58,409
Sheila Smith, your therapist?

1137
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,164
She kept me for a few days

1138
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:02,322
and then she sent me on to people
in the underground.

1139
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:08,322
- She sent you to them? Sheila?
- Yes.

1140
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,409
They took care of me.

1141
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,727
But it wasn't safe to stay anywhere.

1142
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:22,970
In two months, I had 15 aliases
and moved every four or five clays.

1143
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:25,771
I took a name from a tombstone
in a cemetery.

1144
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,126
Merry...

1145
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:32,364
One morning, I received a phone call
that I was to go to the Greyhound station.

1146
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,362
They gave me a ticket to Chicago.

1147
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,931
I would stay there for two days
and then travel to Oregon,

1148
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,209
where there would be sanctuary.

1149
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:46,250
I was raped the night I arrived
in Chica... cago.

1150
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:49,290
Oh, my God.

1151
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:53,883
Held captive and raped and robbed.

1152
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:55,849
Come home with me, Merry.

1153
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:59,286
You go, Daddy.

1154
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:03,570
Leave you?
You think I could leave you?

1155
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:06,211
- After everything I've...
- You must.

1156
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:11,200
is go.

1157
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:16,481
No. You're asking me
to do something impossible.

1158
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,888
I've looked for you for so long.

1159
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:22,769
I can't.

1160
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,569
Come home.
Come home, Merry.

1161
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:34,048
Please go now, Daddy.

1162
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,524
Please go.

1163
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:50,489
What's wrong, Swede?

1164
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,449
You never told me.

1165
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,766
- You've seen her, you've seen Merry.
- She came to your house.

1166
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,809
Why did you let her go?

1167
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:05,923
Answer me!
You knew.

1168
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,764
It was on the news.

1169
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,920
She blew up a building
and you hid her in your house?

1170
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:12,725
When I heard,
I couldn't believe it.

1171
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:16,282
But I was her therapist.
I couldn't betray her.

1172
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,084
You did betray her!

1173
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:20,640
You sent her to people,
the worst people in the world,

1174
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,529
the ones who got her
to do what she did.

1175
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:25,410
That's not true. Merry believed
in what she did.

1176
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:27,687
No! A man died!

1177
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,570
A good man. I'll never believe
that that's what she wanted.

1178
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:32,130
They manipulated her.

1179
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:35,363
They used her for their crazy,
fucking politics.

1180
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,805
You used her.

1181
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:39,082
You're trying to make this
my responsibility.

1182
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:41,128
You and your radical friends.

1183
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:45,171
They don't believe in peace or war
or the Vietnamese people.

1184
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:47,447
They just wanted to blow a hole
in the world,

1185
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:50,729
the biggest hole they could
in everything that was good!

1186
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,646
They don't care if people get killed!
And you sent her right to them!

1187
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:58,884
I sent her to where she'd be safe.
She couldn't stay here.

1188
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:02,203
She was a troubled girl.
Going to prison was not what she...

1189
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,288
You think she was troubled then?

1190
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:07,091
Oh, my God, Sheila,
you haven't seen her now!

1191
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:09,567
How she lives! Where she's been!

1192
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:12,211
- She was raped!
- No, don't say that.

1193
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:14,256
Listen, I'm telling you something!
Did you hear me?

1194
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:16,647
- Stop it.
- She's been raped!

1195
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:19,530
My daughter!

1196
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:23,244
She's sick in her body...

1197
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:25,890
sick in her mind!

1198
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:05,607
Dawn says to get
the steaks going, Swede.

1199
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:09,046
Right. Okay.

1200
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,851
She wants me inside,
helping with the corn.

1201
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:15,925
<i>And it's going to be
close, and he is out at home plate.</i>

1202
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,642
<i>He's out! It's a double play
with a tag from Ray Fosse.</i>

1203
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:24,042
<i>And here comes Mets manager,
Yogi Berra, to argue with the ump...</i>

1204
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:27,090
Ah, I don't believe it.

1205
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:29,683
God damn this team!

1206
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:35,209
- I thought Bill told you to put the...
- I can't.

1207
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:38,763
I need to talk to you.

1208
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,846
I hope this is important.

1209
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:51,049
Leaving the Orcutts
to your parents like this...

1210
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:58,169
Look, have you seen where Bill and I
moved the sunroom?

1211
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:00,971
He was so wrong
about the Western light.

1212
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:03,965
It's about Merry.

1213
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,364
What about Merry?

1214
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:12,849
All this time, we've had no idea
where she is.

1215
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:15,571
And we aren't going to.

1216
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:19,042
If she'd wanted us to find her,
she would have told us how.

1217
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:22,010
She hasn't wanted to.
We've had to accept that.

1218
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,606
- Dawn...
- We've had to accept that and we have.

1219
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:28,126
- But just suppose...
- Suppose what?

1220
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:30,400
What?

1221
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,768
Suppose that we knew
where she was.

1222
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:37,726
Go on. What is it now?

1223
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:41,770
Do you have a new lead?
Some hunch?

1224
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,683
- Some information?
- More than that.

1225
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,649
Why? Did someone call?

1226
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,768
Some nut who saw her
at an airport in Phoenix

1227
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,296
or at a fucking Hare Krishna meeting?
ls that what it is, Swede?

1228
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:51,976
Will you listen?
I'm telling you something.

1229
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,606
When are you going
to give up on her?

1230
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,365
I can't.

1231
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:04,089
I tried so hard, but I can't.

1232
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:12,764
Our old life is gone, Swede.

1233
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:16,045
It's dead.

1234
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:21,891
This.

1235
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:23,928
This is our only future.

1236
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:31,802
Excuse me, we have guests.

1237
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:42,320
<i>Nixon.</i>

1238
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:45,210
Watergate. It's all I hear.
Day and night, he goes on...

1239
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:49,285
Von Ehrlichman,
von Haldeman, von Nixon.

1240
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,089
They're all <i>mamzers.</i>

1241
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:54,084
I agree with you, Mr. Levov.
They should all go to jail.

1242
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:57,482
- And I'm a Republican!
- Good for you, Mrs. Orcutt.

1243
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:59,324
Are you okay, son?

1244
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:03,530
- Sure I am, Mom.
- Oh, my boy.

1245
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,762
Who could want a better son?

1246
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,200
Jesse, don't you think
you've had enough, dear?

1247
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,089
Can I get you something, Dad?

1248
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:28,369
No. Rest,
you don't look so great.

1249
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:33,608
I'll get you another drink.

1250
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:55,120
Not now.

1251
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:57,720
Not now.

1252
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:22,080
Seymour?

1253
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:23,650
Don't say anything!

1254
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,684
- Swede.
- No.

1255
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,526
Why are apes here?

1256
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:51,765
<i>Why are kangaroos here?</i>

1257
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:57,601
<i>Life is just a short space of time</i>

1258
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:00,365
<i>in which you were alive.</i>

1259
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:34,803
Merry.

1260
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:37,321
I have to ask you something.

1261
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:40,210
I have to ask you something
I promised I wouldn't ask,

1262
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:41,566
but I must.

1263
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:44,763
You can ask me anything.

1264
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:50,045
Did you do it?

1265
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:53,442
Do what, Daddy?

1266
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,682
Plant the bomb in the post office.

1267
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:01,446
Yes.

1268
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,084
Who made you do it?

1269
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:09,691
- Lyndon Johnson.
- No, who talked you into it?

1270
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:15,127
How strongly you still crave the idea
of your innocent child.

1271
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:18,600
Was it Rita?

1272
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:21,608
- Who's Rita?
- Rita, the girl you sent,

1273
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:23,330
the one who came to my office.

1274
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:27,360
I never sent you anyone.

1275
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:31,648
Was this just some kind of game you were
playing with me, the two of you?

1276
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:35,451
I relinquish all cruelty,
I relinquish all control,

1277
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,204
all influence over the world.

1278
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:40,409
Do you? Do you?

1279
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:43,609
Well, you have
influence over me, Merry.

1280
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:46,126
I renounce all attachments
whether little or much,

1281
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:48,322
small or great,
living or lifeless.

1282
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:51,204
Were there others?

1283
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:55,244
Did others die?

1284
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:57,243
Were you involved
in other bombings?

1285
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:00,930
Two.

1286
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:03,763
You built the bombs.

1287
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:06,047
I built and planted the bombs.

1288
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,524
Was anyone killed?

1289
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:12,726
Yes.

1290
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:15,526
Who?

1291
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:18,526
People.

1292
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:21,090
How many people?

1293
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:24,326
Three.

1294
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:32,170
I'm going in now.

1295
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:41,684
Don't go away from me.
Don't go anywhere.

1296
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:46,281
Daddy, how much suffering
do you want?

1297
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:48,805
Who are you?

1298
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,811
Where is my daughter?

1299
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:55,565
My daughter did not kill four people.

1300
01:35:57,640 --> 01:35:59,244
Say it isn't you.

1301
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:03,489
Say it isn't you!

1302
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:27,847
Look...

1303
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:30,921
Merry.

1304
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:34,846
Your ballet shoes,

1305
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:37,082
your riding ribbons,
all your things.

1306
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,684
My stuttering book.

1307
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,528
Why have you
brought these things?

1308
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,247
Does it mean that
you aren't coming back?

1309
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:08,646
Because if it does,
maybe that's best.

1310
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:12,520
Merry...

1311
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:16,010
I'm your father.

1312
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,766
I made you and I found you.

1313
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:26,284
And there's no way I can ever lose you
or you can ever lose me again.

1314
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,369
Let me take you home.

1315
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:38,083
I can't leave you here.

1316
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:42,570
You've seen me.

1317
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:47,564
Please go now.

1318
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:54,285
If you love me,
you'll let me be.

1319
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:32,323
<i>That was to be
the last time he ever saw her.</i>

1320
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,048
<i>He never got over Merry.</i>

1321
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:43,009
<i>He never got over her...</i>

1322
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:47,522
<i>and never gave up on her.</i>

1323
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:05,524
It was good to see you.

1324
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:09,208
Will you excuse me?

1325
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:13,126
- Are you taking off?
- Oh, there you are. Uh...

1326
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:17,489
Yeah. These days I'm asleep
on my feet after 9:00.

1327
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:19,483
Yeah, me too.

1328
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:22,564
Uh, well, it was good
to see you. Really.

1329
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:25,040
Well, night.

1330
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:27,280
Jerry.

1331
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:35,002
The Swede's funeral tomorrow,
do you mind if I come?

1332
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:37,765
No. No, not at all.
I'd be happy to see you.

1333
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:41,407
You remember.
You were there.

1334
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:44,363
He called you "Skip."

1335
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:56,690
As we prepare to recite
the mourner's Kaddish,

1336
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:59,326
we remember the Swede
one last time.

1337
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:03,246
A football hero, a baseball hero,

1338
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:05,448
an officer in the Marines.

1339
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:08,689
<i>What Merry blew up
with that bomb of hers</i>

1340
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:11,809
<i>was nothing less than his life.</i>

1341
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:15,805
<i>He never got past
the Rimrock Bomber,</i>

1342
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:20,408
<i>a girl who perhaps didn't deserve
anything from him,</i>

1343
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:24,724
<i>who wasn't on the same playing field
as him or anybody else.</i>

1344
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:28,771
At this time, please rise
for the mourner's Kaddish.

1345
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:36,730
<i>You come at people
with an open mind</i>

1346
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:39,605
<i>and yet you never fail
to get them wrong.</i>

1347
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:44,363
<i>You get them wrong
while you're with them</i>

1348
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:48,411
<i>or you tell someone about them
and get them wrong again.</i>

1349
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:52,841
<i>That's how we know we're alive.</i>

1350
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:55,690
<i>We are wrong.</i>

1351
01:40:57,720 --> 01:41:00,451
<i>About the Swede,</i>

1352
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:03,091
<i>how life was going to open its arms</i>

1353
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:06,329
<i>and shower blessings upon him.</i>

1354
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:10,564
<i>I was never more wrong
about anyone in my life.</i>

1355
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:23,690
Thank you. It's nice to see you.
Thanks for coming today.

2
00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:14,959
Fai!

3
00:01:21,126 --> 00:01:22,501
What happened to you?

4
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:25,042
Send an ambulance over.

5
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:27,959
What's your name? What happened?

6
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:31,209
I'm Hahou Mo.

7
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:40,042
I killed someone.

8
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:34,084
"Three years later."

9
00:04:05,251 --> 00:04:06,834
Estimated time of death is 2:30 a.m.

10
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:08,251
Madam is here.

11
00:04:19,917 --> 00:04:21,792
Madam, this is Tarn Sir.

12
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,376
Tarn Fu-wing from Tsimshatsui Crime Unit.

13
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:27,583
Luk Yuen-sum from HQ. I'm taking over.

14
00:04:27,584 --> 00:04:29,709
I understand. Down this way.

15
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:31,417
Big Guy!

16
00:04:35,084 --> 00:04:37,792
I told them to check the nearby CCTV,

17
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:40,334
to find out how the Ferrari crashed.

18
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:49,750
Anything in the car?

19
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:51,917
2 packs of drugs in the driver seat.

20
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:54,001
Where's the body? Not in the car?

21
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:55,459
In the tunnel.

22
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:13,192
Is this Glock 17 the murder weapon?

23
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:15,001
No, it belongs to the deceased.

24
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:16,584
All rounds have been fired,

25
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,334
but didn't hit anyone.

26
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:32,626
Estimated time of death is 2:30 a.m.

27
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:34,417
No sign of the body being moved.

28
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,292
I believe he was killed right here.

29
00:05:36,626 --> 00:05:38,667
He sustained multiple injuries.

30
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:42,001
Check out the bruises on his left hand,

31
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:44,542
fractured ribs and sternum

32
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,917
dislocated lower jaw and a skull
with comminuted fracture,

33
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:49,459
all indicate the impact of a heavy blow.

34
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:51,292
From the crash?

35
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:53,125
No, according to Forensics,

36
00:05:53,126 --> 00:05:55,959
the injuries are created by bare hands.

37
00:05:56,334 --> 00:05:57,667
Check out his throat.

38
00:05:57,876 --> 00:05:59,459
There's no apparent open wound,

39
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:03,292
but his cervial vertebra
and wind pipe have snapped.

40
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:06,792
By bare hands?

41
00:06:30,876 --> 00:06:32,251
Try to clench your fist.

42
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:33,751
I can't.

43
00:06:34,376 --> 00:06:35,626
I can't even hold a cup.

44
00:06:36,084 --> 00:06:38,792
The hand trembles when the weather changes.

45
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:42,625
The wound was bone deep,

46
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:43,666
you didn't consult a doctor back then,

47
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:45,000
or else you would have recovered.

48
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:46,376
I did that on purpose.

49
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:48,876
I hacked that bastard
30 times before I was hit.

50
00:06:49,126 --> 00:06:50,542
When I look at the scar,

51
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:53,500
I know I have avenged my daughter.

52
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:55,084
Yes, you've got a point, OK?

53
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:00,542
See you later.

54
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:04,209
Looks who's here!
The asshole who just got arrested.

55
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:06,626
Move, you old bastard!

56
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,626
Let's go sit over there!

57
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:09,751
Get lost!

58
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:13,084
We're leaving... sorry!

59
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:17,292
Get lost!

60
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:19,501
We're leaving... sorry!

61
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:23,584
Read the paper.

62
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:30,208
Come on.

63
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:32,251
A bizarre homicide

64
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:34,177
took place inside the
Salisbury Road tunnel.

65
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:38,084
A body with multiple injuries was found.

66
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:40,042
The victim Mak Wing-yan,

67
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,584
a.k.a. Shark Yan,

68
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:42,992
had multiple criminal records.

69
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:44,792
The Police found drugs at the scene.

70
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:47,584
It's possible the murder is drug related.

71
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:51,167
Chief Inspector Luk Yuen-sum is
in charge of the investigation.

72
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,501
Sir, I need to make a call.

73
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:58,987
I need to make a call to F0 Shan.

74
00:07:59,084 --> 00:07:59,876
Sure!

75
00:07:59,877 --> 00:08:01,292
- It won't take long. - Fill out the form.

76
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:02,292
But Sir...

77
00:08:02,293 --> 00:08:04,333
Ask someone to buy you a phone card,

78
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:05,375
Don't play me, Sir.

79
00:08:05,376 --> 00:08:08,126
Give it to your welfare
officer and get in line.

80
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:09,666
You can make the call in front
of the welfare officer.

81
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:12,000
Just one call, Sir.

82
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:13,709
Everyone says it's urgent.

83
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:15,251
No matter how urgent,

84
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:17,876
we must go by the book.

85
00:08:18,084 --> 00:08:21,334
Sir... Please help me out! Do you hear me?

86
00:08:36,084 --> 00:08:38,001
I want to see Madam Luk.

87
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:40,876
I can help her with the case.

88
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:42,834
Yes, Sir!

89
00:08:44,084 --> 00:08:46,667
Shall I serve you milk tea and toast?

90
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:49,501
You think you're still the instructor?

91
00:08:49,626 --> 00:08:51,334
You can see anyone you want?

92
00:08:56,834 --> 00:08:59,001
We'll fix the old man in the shower.

93
00:09:17,751 --> 00:09:19,459
What are you doing? Don't fight!

94
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:20,791
Don't fight!

95
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:21,876
Fix him!

96
00:09:42,334 --> 00:09:43,751
Beat him up!

97
00:11:00,876 --> 00:11:05,417
Hands on your head! Get down!

98
00:11:11,876 --> 00:11:13,417
I want to see Luk Yuen-sum!

99
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,584
I want to see Luk Yuen-sum!

100
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:19,792
He is a model inmate,

101
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:21,757
and has been on good behavior
the past 3 years.

102
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:24,042
But yesterday he asked for you

103
00:11:25,126 --> 00:11:26,834
and beat up on other inmates.

104
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:30,667
This behavior is highly unusual.

105
00:11:33,334 --> 00:11:34,626
How many?

106
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:37,334
17...

107
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:38,917
Open up!

108
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:58,751
Madam,

109
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:01,084
could you buy me 17 carton of smokes

110
00:12:01,251 --> 00:12:03,292
for those I have injured?

111
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:05,417
I'll pay you back next time.

112
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:07,459
Next time?

113
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:09,542
You'll be back.

114
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:14,459
I once fought Shark Yan,
the Boxing Champion.

115
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:16,501
You know who's the killer?

116
00:12:16,876 --> 00:12:18,083
I know what he is.

117
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:18,792
You know him?

118
00:12:18,793 --> 00:12:19,917
No.

119
00:12:20,751 --> 00:12:22,626
I know what he's thinking.

120
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,251
He'll strike again.

121
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:26,876
How do you know?

122
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:28,959
You don't kill someone

123
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:30,542
in an ordinary duel.

124
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,041
Even when I killed someone by accident,

125
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,292
I didn't run off.

126
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:35,626
If it's revenge, he should have used a gun.

127
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:39,084
Killing with bare hands,
he meant to slaughter.

128
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:42,792
Don't you think he did that on purpose?

129
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:45,709
I know what he's thinking.

130
00:12:47,126 --> 00:12:48,792
I can help you catch him if

131
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:50,209
you set me free.

132
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:53,084
Why do you think I need your help?

133
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:56,251
Because you know martial arts
and what he's thinking?

134
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:02,917
Shoulders merge with crotch,

135
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:04,334
elbows with knees,

136
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:05,709
hands with feet.

137
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:07,626
Capturing is rigid, seizing is flexible.

138
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:09,042
One moves onto weapons

139
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:10,876
after he masters grappling.

140
00:13:11,084 --> 00:13:13,084
A weapon is the extension of the limbs.

141
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,959
When man and weapon merge,

142
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:16,917
heart merges with mind,

143
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:19,158
mind merges with energy,
and energy merges with strength.

144
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:21,389
Yin on the inside and yang on the outside.

145
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:23,626
Energy is formed inside out.

146
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:26,376
You can't move on without first attaining
the previous form.

147
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:28,066
What the hell are you talking about?

148
00:13:28,084 --> 00:13:30,459
I cracked many cases without
knowing martial arts.

149
00:13:30,584 --> 00:13:32,784
Knowing martials arts doesn't mean
you can solve a case.

150
00:13:32,876 --> 00:13:35,209
Give me another reason.

151
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:42,542
Tung Ching-ting, Tarn King-yiu, Cho Chi-on,

152
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:46,334
Yuen Ching-yeung, Fong Man-hei,
Fu Sing-tai, Fong Luk-tak,

153
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:49,167
one of these seven men
will be the next victim.

154
00:13:50,376 --> 00:13:52,792
Sit down!

155
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:06,842
Dig up everything you can
about all 8 of them.

156
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:07,751
8?

157
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:08,751
Including Hahou Mo.

158
00:14:08,876 --> 00:14:10,126
Yes, Madam!

161
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:34,084
Over 10 years ago,

162
00:15:34,626 --> 00:15:37,501
a man called Tarn King-yiu

163
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:41,917
kicked his way to the top in Asia.

164
00:15:43,334 --> 00:15:46,334
He was regarded as the best.

165
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:50,292
Afterwards,

166
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:52,792
he retired

167
00:15:53,376 --> 00:15:55,542
and became an artist.

168
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:04,709

00:16:08,126 --> 00:16:09,709
to fight you

171
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:11,959
to the death.

172
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:14,126
Get off!

173
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:16,584
You can't step on that.

174
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:23,792
Can we fight now?

175
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:45,626
You're born with a handicap in your legs,

176
00:16:46,376 --> 00:16:49,042
I'm really impressed

177
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,000
you trained yourself to overcome it.

178
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:52,333
You're renowned for your kicking,

179
00:16:52,334 --> 00:16:54,501
I wish to challenge you.

180
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:39,792
Tung Ching-ting, Tam King-yiu,

181
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:42,459
Fu Sing-tai, Fong Luk-tak are all clean

182
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:44,167
and have different backgrounds
and professions.

183
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:45,374
They're ordinary citizens.

184
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:46,834
Do they know martial arts?

185
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:48,209
I'll need to check.

186
00:17:48,376 --> 00:17:50,709
Now Hahou Mo is interesting.

187
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:53,125
He once headed the famous martial arts club

188
00:17:53,126 --> 00:17:54,376
Six Mergence Sect in Fo Shan,

189
00:17:55,001 --> 00:17:58,042
which had thousands
of followers in its heyday.

190
00:17:58,209 --> 00:17:59,375
He was enlisted by the Hong Kong Police

191
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:00,834
as a martial arts instructor.

192
00:18:01,126 --> 00:18:03,292
He killed someone in a duel

193
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:04,959
and got a 5-year sentence.

194
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,834
His followers and students dispersed,

195
00:18:07,251 --> 00:18:08,971
while many of the branch schools shut down.

196
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:11,126
Madam, we have a problem!

197
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:29,292
We interrupt with a breaking news

198
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:33,251
of a homicide at the
Arts Expo this morning.

199
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:35,833
The victim is a contemporary artist,

200
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:37,416
Tarn King-yiu.

201
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:40,126
I can help you catch him
if you set me free.

202
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:43,376
I know what he's thinking.

203
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:46,084
Give me another reason.

204
00:18:49,751 --> 00:18:52,792
Tung Ching-ting, Tam King-yiu,

205
00:18:53,084 --> 00:18:55,959
one of these seven men
will be the next victim.

206
00:18:57,167 --> 00:18:58,584
You'll be back.

207
00:19:06,459 --> 00:19:07,667
Tarn King-yiu is dead.

208
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:12,959
He was kicked to death?

209
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:15,376
Does it matter?

210
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:20,376
Tarn had awesome leg training
and was kicked to death,

211
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,417
and Mak was an expert boxer
and was beaten to death,

212
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:24,667
weren't they?

213
00:19:25,334 --> 00:19:28,667
Let me out so I can help you, or

214
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,042
more people will die.

215
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:55,334
It won't be long now.

216
00:19:56,501 --> 00:19:57,667
Won't be long.

217
00:20:04,126 --> 00:20:07,126
"Conquer The Five Battles
(CHINESE OPERA)"

218
00:20:13,751 --> 00:20:19,709
"Wong Chit"

219
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:40,751
Thanks.

220
00:20:40,752 --> 00:20:41,876
Bye-bye.

221
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:47,959
Good morning.

222
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:49,126
Morning.

223
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,542
This is your temporary pass.

224
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,333
From now on,

225
00:20:54,334 --> 00:20:56,376
you're in Police custody.

226
00:20:57,042 --> 00:20:58,417
Inside is a cell phone,

227
00:20:58,584 --> 00:21:00,459
we must be able to reach
you round the clock,

228
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,042
until we close file and we don't need you.

229
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:04,959
Whether or not you go back to jail

230
00:21:05,084 --> 00:21:06,001
and for how long,

231
00:21:06,002 --> 00:21:07,792
will depend on your behavior.

232
00:21:14,251 --> 00:21:15,626
You're out.

233
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:18,709
Tell me how you can help me.

234
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:21,626
According to the sequence of the victims,

235
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:24,751
the killer seems to be following
a martial arts phrase.

236
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:27,334
Starting with fists,
then legs and grappling,

237
00:21:27,709 --> 00:21:29,709
weapons and internal energy.

238
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:31,250
His target is always the expert

239
00:21:31,251 --> 00:21:32,709
in the repsective discipline.

240
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,084
Who's the next target?

241
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:39,959
Go to Mongkok.

242
00:21:41,376 --> 00:21:43,417
"Tattoo Studio"

243
00:21:54,626 --> 00:21:57,417
We're closed. Come back tomorrow.

244
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:04,876
We found this at the scene,

245
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:06,167
what do you make of it?

246
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:08,001
I don't know.

247
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:11,876
If your logic is

248
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:15,709
boxing, kicking then grappling,

249
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:18,084
is Wong Chit

250
00:22:18,292 --> 00:22:19,959
a" expert grappler?

251
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:24,126
He was, 3 years ago.

252
00:22:39,084 --> 00:22:40,959
Go up...

253
00:22:41,501 --> 00:22:43,751
Excuse me, step back...

254
00:22:45,834 --> 00:22:47,084
Go up...

255
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:54,292
His hand is bent out of shape

256
00:22:54,459 --> 00:22:55,459
as if it was smashed by a hammer.

257
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,292
The so-called breaking
the bones and tendons?

258
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:03,084
Grappling!

259
00:23:03,376 --> 00:23:04,959
If the killer is the same person,

260
00:23:05,376 --> 00:23:06,916
is it possible he's proficient

261
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:08,459
in boxing, kicking and grappling?

262
00:23:08,876 --> 00:23:10,126
It's not impossible.

263
00:23:18,376 --> 00:23:22,542
I came to fight you to the death.

264
00:25:23,126 --> 00:25:24,667
He won't shut his eyes!

265
00:25:25,001 --> 00:25:26,292
He was my friend.

266
00:25:27,001 --> 00:25:28,501
My friend.

267
00:25:49,126 --> 00:25:50,542
Don't move!

268
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:06,417
He jumped to the next building,
lock it down!

269
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:11,084
Police! Open up!

270
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:15,166
Madam, we searched the nearby buildings.

271
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:16,584
No sign of Hahou Mo.

272
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:23,626
I can't take your call right now,

273
00:27:23,834 --> 00:27:25,084
please leave a message.

274
00:27:27,626 --> 00:27:28,751
Sinn Ying,

275
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:30,959
I'm out.

276
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,459
I'm on my way back to Fo Shan.

277
00:27:52,459 --> 00:27:53,751
See you.

278
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:22,417
"Six Mergence Sect"

279
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:38,376
Shifu,

280
00:29:39,251 --> 00:29:40,376
I was wrong.

281
00:29:41,126 --> 00:29:44,751
I thought beating other
sects would bring glory,

282
00:29:45,876 --> 00:29:47,501
but I caused trouble instead,

283
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:50,542
for killed someone by accident.

284
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:53,751
I'm so sorry!

285
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:35,376
I got this for you.

286
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:36,792
Hopefully the string

287
00:30:37,209 --> 00:30:39,959
can restrain your fists

288
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:41,834
and help you control yourself.

289
00:31:34,334 --> 00:31:35,417
Where did this come from?

290
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:40,209
A few months ago, a man came to the school.

291
00:31:40,751 --> 00:31:44,126
He was about 30 and was limping.

292
00:31:44,501 --> 00:31:46,667
He asked me to give this to you.

293
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:50,876
Is everything alright?

294
00:31:53,292 --> 00:31:55,334
I'm actually working for
the Hong Kong Police.

295
00:31:56,084 --> 00:31:58,834
The case may be related to this thing.

296
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,376
Don't worry!

297
00:32:03,792 --> 00:32:05,167
Are you sure?

298
00:32:06,042 --> 00:32:07,417
Don't worry!

299
00:32:08,251 --> 00:32:10,917
You wanted to see To Fook-ming?

300
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:13,251
Because of this thing?

301
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:15,542
I'll take you to him tomorrow morning.

302
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:19,251
Get some sleep!

303
00:32:19,251 --> 00:32:20,251
Good night.

304
00:32:20,459 --> 00:32:22,501
Good night.

305
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,083
"The same object was"

306
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,334
"found at the scene."

307
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:36,833
"The Police believe the killer
left it behind for a reason"

308
00:32:36,834 --> 00:32:38,250
"and has released a picture
of the object to the media."

309
00:32:38,251 --> 00:32:39,791
"Anyone who has information of the object"

310
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:41,352
"should contact the Police right away."

311
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:54,417
Suet!

312
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:56,376
It won't be long now.

313
00:32:57,626 --> 00:32:58,876
Won't be long.

314
00:34:31,751 --> 00:34:32,376
Enjoy!

315
00:34:32,376 --> 00:34:33,001
Thank you.

316
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:34,292
Thank you.

317
00:34:36,376 --> 00:34:38,626
Swallows used to nest
beneath the eaves of the rich

318
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:41,626
now enter the homes of commoners.

319
00:34:43,376 --> 00:34:46,376
This is called "Eaves Swallow".

320
00:34:47,042 --> 00:34:48,251
In the Qing dynasty,

321
00:34:48,626 --> 00:34:51,501
martial artists used to compete in Beijing.

322
00:34:51,917 --> 00:34:54,166
The losers will each get an Eaves Swallow

323
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:57,126
from the Ministry of War.

324
00:34:57,792 --> 00:34:59,417
Yours is an imitation,

325
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:02,417
the real one is made of silver and lead

326
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:03,876
and should be worth something.

327
00:35:04,042 --> 00:35:05,417
A consolation prize.

328
00:35:06,751 --> 00:35:08,584
This so called conferment

329
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:10,542
definitely had a different meaning.

330
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:12,500
It appeared to be a token of

331
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:14,459
appreciation for their hard work.

332
00:35:14,626 --> 00:35:16,106
But in reality, the message was clear

333
00:35:16,376 --> 00:35:19,751
that martial artists completely useless,

334
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:23,792
just like a swallow beneath
the eaves of the Qing Emperor.

335
00:35:24,334 --> 00:35:27,084
What's your interest in it?

336
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,834
A serial killer of martial artists

337
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:31,917
left the Eaves Swallow at the scene.

338
00:35:32,126 --> 00:35:34,417
The killer is a cripple.

339
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:39,376
Anything else you wish to add?

340
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:42,542
That's about it.

341
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:46,042
That's all I know.

342
00:35:47,876 --> 00:35:48,959
Thank you, sir.

343
00:35:49,084 --> 00:35:49,834
Thank you.

344
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:51,959
We won't impose on you anymore.

345
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:53,126
Goodbye.

346
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:54,626
I know him.

347
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:57,209
6 years ago, this man showed up

348
00:35:57,501 --> 00:35:58,876
to challenge me and we fought.

349
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:01,126
He beat me in the end

350
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:04,001
and left behind this Eaves Swallow.

351
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:08,625
He had an unusual name, it sounded ancient.

352
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:10,001
It's Fung Yu-sau.

353
00:36:10,584 --> 00:36:12,459
He was born with an atrophied left leg,

354
00:36:12,792 --> 00:36:14,542
his legs are of different lengths

355
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:17,001
as well as different strengths.

356
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:20,876
Overcoming the handicap through practice,

357
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:23,209
his achievement

358
00:36:24,126 --> 00:36:25,792
is rather inconceivable.

359
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:27,959
Do you know where he is?

360
00:36:28,667 --> 00:36:30,834
He lives with his wife on...

361
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:32,542
Sui Kwai Lane.

362
00:36:38,001 --> 00:36:39,001
Madam.

363
00:36:39,084 --> 00:36:39,834
Who's this?

364
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:41,084
Hahou Mo!

365
00:36:41,334 --> 00:36:42,167
Where are you?

366
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:43,292
You've been classified as a fugitive

367
00:36:43,293 --> 00:36:44,959
and been wanted.

368
00:36:46,001 --> 00:36:47,417
I just had a lead on the killer.

369
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,501
Crossing the border without our
consent is a major breach.

370
00:36:54,834 --> 00:36:57,042
I can revoke his parole any minute.

371
00:36:57,292 --> 00:36:58,834
This is a martial arts business.

372
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:01,376
You may not be able to close file
without our help.

373
00:37:02,126 --> 00:37:04,042
If we help you apprehend the killer,

374
00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:05,959
does he have to go back to jail?

375
00:37:08,209 --> 00:37:09,689
We'll get to that when we close file.

376
00:37:29,501 --> 00:37:30,709
Thank you.

377
00:37:36,376 --> 00:37:38,709
No sign of the suspect, please come up.

378
00:37:39,084 --> 00:37:40,417
Tai Yue, check with Immigration.

379
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:41,667
Yes, Madam!

380
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:50,376
Big Guy, check upstairs.

381
00:37:50,626 --> 00:37:51,751
Yes, Madam!

382
00:37:52,709 --> 00:37:53,959
You two stay here.

383
00:37:54,126 --> 00:37:55,417
Don't touch anything.

384
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:11,126
We searched the house, no one is here.

385
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:12,917
The tenant is Shum Suet.

386
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:14,751
She lived here with Fung Yu-sau,

387
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,584
but they've moved out already.

388
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:18,542
She's the landlady,

389
00:38:18,751 --> 00:38:20,084
she knows the suspect.

390
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:23,751
The man's name is Fung Yu-sau.

391
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:25,334
Shum Suet is his wife.

392
00:38:25,542 --> 00:38:27,584
They're a pair of love birds.

393
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:30,167
The wife has cancer.

394
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:33,541
The husband does nothing
but practice martial arts.

395
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:34,917
Over there.

396
00:38:35,334 --> 00:38:37,751
Attain ultimate emptiness
and absolute tranquility,

397
00:38:38,209 --> 00:38:41,292
I observe all things as they develop

398
00:38:41,626 --> 00:38:44,959
and return to their origin.

399
00:38:45,126 --> 00:38:47,876
It means repose and
a return to their destiny,

400
00:38:48,042 --> 00:38:50,959
which leads eternity, to know eternity
means enlightenment.

401
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:07,792
One day I watched him on the roof.

402
00:39:08,876 --> 00:39:12,001
He rubbed his face with something white,

403
00:39:12,334 --> 00:39:16,084
until there was blood all over his face.

404
00:39:16,834 --> 00:39:18,501
He must be crazy!

405
00:39:19,292 --> 00:39:23,459
He's practicing. It's an ancient method.

406
00:39:23,751 --> 00:39:26,001
He used coarse grained sea salt

407
00:39:26,251 --> 00:39:29,667
to thicken his skin, so he can
take a longer beating.

408
00:40:10,751 --> 00:40:13,084
He turned his handicap
into an awesome weapon.

409
00:40:14,876 --> 00:40:16,500
Without a care in the world,

410
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:18,958
alone and without a home,

411
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:20,639
I can now challenge other martial artists.

412
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,042
That's the motive.

413
00:40:22,292 --> 00:40:24,376
He wants to challenge
other martial artists,

414
00:40:27,042 --> 00:40:28,417
and he wants to be No. 1!

415
00:40:29,876 --> 00:40:31,209
A few months ago,
they said they had to go away

416
00:40:31,501 --> 00:40:33,084
to take care of business in Hong Kong,

417
00:40:33,292 --> 00:40:35,751
and paid me 6 months'
rent before they left.

418
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:39,417
Madam, we got something.

419
00:40:39,917 --> 00:40:41,626
I checked with Immigration,

420
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:43,876
they said they remembered Shum Suet

421
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:46,917
because she sat in the lobby by herself

422
00:40:47,084 --> 00:40:48,459
and they helped push her through.

423
00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:50,251
We checked with Hong Kong Immigration,

424
00:40:50,459 --> 00:40:52,042
their record showed Shum Suet

425
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:55,292
came to Hong Kong from
Fo Shan 3 months ago.

426
00:40:56,001 --> 00:40:57,334
They have nothing after that.

427
00:40:57,917 --> 00:40:59,709
6 years ago, Fung Yu-sau was committed

428
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:01,417
to a mental hospital in Fo Shan.

429
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:03,834
There's no recent record of him
entering Hong Kong.

430
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:06,959
He's being very careful,

431
00:41:07,417 --> 00:41:09,292
trying not to leave a trace.

432
00:41:11,626 --> 00:41:12,626
I bet

433
00:41:12,959 --> 00:41:14,709
he started planning to kill back then.

434
00:41:16,876 --> 00:41:19,209
"Six Mergence Sect"

435
00:41:22,709 --> 00:41:24,584
I must go back with them.

436
00:41:25,292 --> 00:41:27,626
This is the condition for my early release.

437
00:41:29,209 --> 00:41:30,791
Can you stay in Shandong

438
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:32,084
with Uncle Chor?

439
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:35,834
Do as I say.

440
00:41:36,751 --> 00:41:37,709
Listen to me.

441
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,292
You fought with Fung Yu-sau already?

442
00:41:39,792 --> 00:41:42,126
That explains your injury.

443
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,959
A martial artist must guard his underarm,

444
00:41:45,042 --> 00:41:45,876
how can you let him injure you?

445
00:41:45,877 --> 00:41:48,042
I have never asked anything of you,

446
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:50,834
but before we catch the killer,
you must go to Shandong.

447
00:41:54,501 --> 00:41:55,751
Very well!

448
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:05,251
But,

449
00:42:05,459 --> 00:42:06,959
if you really care about me,

450
00:42:07,292 --> 00:42:09,501
you should let me stay with you.

451
00:42:09,834 --> 00:42:11,333
Listen to me...

452
00:42:11,334 --> 00:42:13,333
Miss Sinn, on behalf
of the Hong Kong Police,

453
00:42:13,334 --> 00:42:14,876
I wish to solicit your help.

454
00:42:15,334 --> 00:42:16,792
But, Madam...

455
00:42:17,292 --> 00:42:19,583
I'll tell Miss Lee,

456
00:42:19,584 --> 00:42:20,750
so she can find a substitute teacher.

457
00:42:20,751 --> 00:42:24,209
No! You can't do this...

458
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:27,041
You can't drag her into this mess!

459
00:42:27,042 --> 00:42:28,500
If she comes along,

460
00:42:28,501 --> 00:42:30,126
you can concentrate on the case.

461
00:42:31,042 --> 00:42:35,042
Madam, come back...

462
00:42:40,001 --> 00:42:41,459
You can't bring a weapon.

463
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,251
I need to practice everyday.

464
00:42:43,417 --> 00:42:45,792
This is from my father.

465
00:42:45,959 --> 00:42:47,376
Sorry, Madam,

466
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:49,876
the sword goes wherever she goes.

467
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:53,709
Who's the next target?

468
00:42:53,917 --> 00:42:55,542
Weapon comes after grappling.

469
00:42:57,084 --> 00:42:59,167
The most likely target is Chan Pak-kwong.

470
00:42:59,334 --> 00:43:01,292
His saber is fast like lightning.

471
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:04,792
Madam, we commandeered several units,

472
00:43:05,042 --> 00:43:07,334
and put eyes in the neighboring streets.

473
00:43:07,584 --> 00:43:09,292
Good, be careful!

474
00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:29,792
Mr. Chow, you're not eating in?

475
00:43:30,042 --> 00:43:32,792
No, I'm eating with my wife tonight.

476
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:46,001
The one holding the shovel
is your weapon master?

477
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:48,584
Back then, with a rod in his hands,

478
00:43:49,292 --> 00:43:51,542
he beat several dozens
holding watermelon knives.

479
00:43:54,792 --> 00:43:55,876
Master Chan!

480
00:43:56,292 --> 00:43:58,542
Try my cooking, Miss Sinn!

481
00:43:58,792 --> 00:43:59,459
Come on, Mo!

482
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,042
Long time no see!

483
00:44:02,167 --> 00:44:05,000
This is my friend Miss Luk.

484
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:08,292
Please sit down! Try my cooking!

485
00:44:08,542 --> 00:44:09,459
How long ago

486
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:13,001
did you beat me?

487
00:44:13,626 --> 00:44:15,167
It was pure luck!

488
00:44:15,459 --> 00:44:18,001
I haven't practiced in 3 years.

489
00:44:19,292 --> 00:44:22,459
I can't practice even if I wanted to. Look!

490
00:44:24,167 --> 00:44:25,959
What happened?

491
00:44:26,209 --> 00:44:28,250
I was in a car crash 2 years ago.

492
00:44:28,251 --> 00:44:30,376
It's nothing but nuts and bolts inside.

493
00:44:32,084 --> 00:44:33,125
What about your school?

494
00:44:33,126 --> 00:44:36,416
Remember you first challenged my protege

495
00:44:36,417 --> 00:44:38,209
and came to me after you beat him?

496
00:44:38,584 --> 00:44:40,166
I'm putting him in charge of the school.

497
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:41,042
I seldom go back now.

498
00:44:41,043 --> 00:44:42,667
The action star Hung Yip?

499
00:44:44,209 --> 00:44:45,417
Now the next shot...

500
00:44:45,626 --> 00:44:47,167
the camera will stay on the bike,

501
00:44:47,417 --> 00:44:49,834
when it lands,

502
00:44:50,417 --> 00:44:52,917
the warriors on the left will
run towards Hung Yip.

503
00:44:53,126 --> 00:44:53,917
Understand?

504
00:44:53,917 --> 00:44:54,667
I understand.

505
00:44:54,667 --> 00:44:55,584
Are you clear?

506
00:44:55,584 --> 00:44:56,501
I'm clear.

507
00:44:56,584 --> 00:44:58,084
Ready... go!

508
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,667
Who let the bike down?
Who let go of the wire?

509
00:45:12,959 --> 00:45:13,626
Who the hell is he?

510
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,542
Who the hell is he? Get rid of him!

511
00:45:16,626 --> 00:45:19,709
Hey, you! Get out!

512
00:45:34,084 --> 00:45:35,584
This is not your fight!

513
00:45:36,542 --> 00:45:37,876
Leave!

514
00:45:43,001 --> 00:45:44,459
Let's go!

515
00:45:47,209 --> 00:45:49,251
For a true expert

516
00:45:49,542 --> 00:45:52,876
still water runs deep.

517
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,459
You're a weapon master,

518
00:45:55,709 --> 00:45:57,376
but reduced to being a stuntman.

519
00:45:58,417 --> 00:45:59,751
Who would have guessed

520
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:03,251
your craft is not an act?

521
00:46:05,542 --> 00:46:07,334
I'm here to challenge you.

522
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:40,709
According to the autopsy,

523
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:43,209
the deceased sustained 14 wounds.

524
00:48:44,084 --> 00:48:46,792
The cause of death is a severed
aorta by something sharp,

525
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:50,084
leaving a wound 16 cm. long.

526
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:05,751
Madam,

527
00:49:06,917 --> 00:49:09,792
we only found Hung Yip's
prints on the sword.

528
00:49:10,584 --> 00:49:12,750
We found a scrap of cloth on the sword

529
00:49:12,751 --> 00:49:14,501
that contains a small amount of blood.

530
00:49:15,542 --> 00:49:17,751
Crosscheck the DNA samples on file,

531
00:49:18,001 --> 00:49:19,376
see if we'll find anything.

532
00:49:19,542 --> 00:49:20,834
Yes, Madam!

533
00:49:25,084 --> 00:49:29,376
Boxing, kicking, grappling and then weapon.

534
00:49:29,626 --> 00:49:31,026
If you move from outside to inside,

535
00:49:31,126 --> 00:49:33,792
what is inside?

536
00:49:34,209 --> 00:49:35,584
Who's next?

537
00:49:35,792 --> 00:49:38,001
Why is he so determined to kill them all?

538
00:49:38,459 --> 00:49:40,625
No one in this day and age would do it,

539
00:49:40,626 --> 00:49:41,959
unless he's a maniac.

540
00:49:43,084 --> 00:49:44,126
A martial arts maniac.

541
00:49:44,292 --> 00:49:45,416
Is that why you killed your opponent?

542
00:49:45,417 --> 00:49:46,792
That's why I'm in jail.

543
00:49:47,667 --> 00:49:50,917
One must pay for one's mistake.
I'm still paying...

544
00:50:07,751 --> 00:50:08,917
This is Lee Yeung-chung.

545
00:50:09,084 --> 00:50:11,417
The last 3 homicides hit the front page.

546
00:50:11,626 --> 00:50:12,626
I could understand that.

547
00:50:13,001 --> 00:50:15,042
Last night's case

548
00:50:15,334 --> 00:50:16,959
became a showbiz headline!

549
00:50:17,667 --> 00:50:20,001
How much time do you
still need to wrap this up?

550
00:50:20,959 --> 00:50:23,834
Sir, I have a very important lead...

551
00:50:24,292 --> 00:50:25,750
Leads are useless.

552
00:50:25,751 --> 00:50:27,292
I want to close file!

553
00:50:27,834 --> 00:50:28,875
Just like in a soccer game,

554
00:50:28,876 --> 00:50:30,251
passing the ball
without shooting for the goal

555
00:50:30,459 --> 00:50:31,667
will never win the game.

556
00:50:32,042 --> 00:50:33,792
I want to know when you can crack the case.

557
00:50:35,334 --> 00:50:37,001
Give me 72 hours.

558
00:50:38,417 --> 00:50:39,666
Fine! 3 days later,

559
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:42,876
you better make the headlines.

560
00:50:51,376 --> 00:50:52,542
Sorry!

561
00:50:53,876 --> 00:50:55,542
I didn't expect Hung Yip would die.

562
00:50:56,917 --> 00:50:58,501
I've been in jail for 3 years,

563
00:50:59,292 --> 00:51:00,876
so much has changed in the meantime.

564
00:51:02,876 --> 00:51:04,376
If we still come up empty handed,

565
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:06,542
I'll be tranferred.

566
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:08,334
And...

567
00:51:09,042 --> 00:51:10,417
you'll go straight back to jail.

568
00:51:13,042 --> 00:51:14,626
Hopefully, with what we have on hand,

569
00:51:15,001 --> 00:51:17,126
we can catch Fung Yu-sau
before he strikes again.

570
00:51:18,209 --> 00:51:20,334
If the blood on the sword

571
00:51:21,292 --> 00:51:22,375
belongs to Fung Yu-sau,

572
00:51:22,376 --> 00:51:23,834
that means he's wounded.

573
00:51:24,126 --> 00:51:26,209
He'll probably lay low for a while.

574
00:51:26,376 --> 00:51:27,458
I need time to find out

575
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:28,292
in martial arts circles

576
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:30,209
who would be the next target.

577
00:51:45,459 --> 00:51:49,584
Hope you'll be out soon
to take on the challenge

578
00:51:59,667 --> 00:52:01,626
Lam Sir, this way...

579
00:52:03,751 --> 00:52:05,083
ls Hahou Mo on parole?

580
00:52:05,084 --> 00:52:06,208
What is his connection to the case?

581
00:52:06,209 --> 00:52:07,416
What do you want with him?

582
00:52:07,417 --> 00:52:08,917
Why can't the Police solve the case?

583
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:11,876
We already have a few leads

584
00:52:12,209 --> 00:52:13,959
and have zeroed in on a suspect.

585
00:52:14,626 --> 00:52:16,625
Once we have something more solid,

586
00:52:16,626 --> 00:52:18,000
we will release it to the media.

587
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:20,041
Lam Sir, the Police said

588
00:52:20,042 --> 00:52:21,958
the killer is after martial artists,

589
00:52:21,959 --> 00:52:23,500
I'm a beginner in judo,

590
00:52:23,501 --> 00:52:25,917
am I in any danger?

591
00:52:27,126 --> 00:52:28,459
Yes or no?

592
00:52:28,626 --> 00:52:30,167
Please say a few words...

593
00:52:30,334 --> 00:52:34,709
Come back, Lam Sir!

594
00:52:36,876 --> 00:52:38,584
Long time no see, Sir!

595
00:52:48,376 --> 00:52:50,625
The metal scraps we found

596
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:51,959
<i>in Fung Yu-sau's house in Fo Shan</i>

597
00:52:52,126 --> 00:52:54,000
is the same material

598
00:52:54,001 --> 00:52:56,167
as the Eaves Swallows.

599
00:52:56,501 --> 00:52:57,209
Madam,

600
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:58,583
we found sea salt

601
00:52:58,584 --> 00:53:00,264
on the scrap of cloth on Hung Yip's sword.

602
00:53:00,542 --> 00:53:01,666
Check the degree of pollution

603
00:53:01,667 --> 00:53:03,166
and cross match it with water
quality of different areas.

604
00:53:03,167 --> 00:53:04,459
Yes, Madam!

605
00:53:09,376 --> 00:53:10,542
This is Fung Yu-sau,

606
00:53:10,792 --> 00:53:12,001
let me speak to Hahou Mo.

607
00:53:12,709 --> 00:53:14,334
He said he's Fung Yu-sau,

608
00:53:14,542 --> 00:53:15,876
he's asking for Hahou Mo.

609
00:53:20,959 --> 00:53:21,792
Call SDU.

610
00:53:21,793 --> 00:53:22,834
Yes, Madam!

611
00:53:27,501 --> 00:53:29,084
Stall him!

612
00:53:35,292 --> 00:53:36,667
This is Hahou Mo.

613
00:53:37,292 --> 00:53:40,667
You should thank me for getting you out.

614
00:53:42,584 --> 00:53:44,167
You should know better.

615
00:53:45,209 --> 00:53:46,751
Boxing, kicking,

616
00:53:47,292 --> 00:53:48,792
grappling and then weapon.

617
00:53:49,667 --> 00:53:52,376
From outside to inside, the Mergence.

618
00:53:53,626 --> 00:53:55,459
No jail can keep you

619
00:53:55,834 --> 00:53:57,584
if you wanted to come out.

620
00:53:58,834 --> 00:54:00,542
Madam, we found him!

621
00:54:00,792 --> 00:54:03,126
"Tsim Sha Tsui"

622
00:54:03,501 --> 00:54:04,709
Action!

623
00:54:05,126 --> 00:54:06,251
SDU action!

624
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:08,167
That day on the roof,

625
00:54:08,709 --> 00:54:10,167
I was disappointed with you.

626
00:54:11,042 --> 00:54:13,042
When we finally meet,

627
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:14,751
lexpect

628
00:54:14,959 --> 00:54:17,001
to see you in top form.

629
00:54:18,709 --> 00:54:20,542
Perhaps I can help you.

630
00:54:21,126 --> 00:54:22,292
If

631
00:54:23,251 --> 00:54:25,001
Your dearly beloved is dead,

632
00:54:26,376 --> 00:54:27,709
I guarantee

633
00:54:28,959 --> 00:54:30,667
you can kill anyone.

634
00:54:30,959 --> 00:54:32,584
You'll be the first, asshole!

635
00:54:33,501 --> 00:54:35,042
I already told you

636
00:54:35,709 --> 00:54:38,001
the only way to stop me is

637
00:54:38,584 --> 00:54:40,167
to kill me.

638
00:55:07,292 --> 00:55:09,166
Madam, SDU at the scene, over!

639
00:55:09,167 --> 00:55:10,501
Up there! Hurry!

640
00:55:11,084 --> 00:55:12,084
"Sauna"

641
00:55:27,792 --> 00:55:28,959
The suspect got away!

642
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:30,792
Fung Yu-sau got away again!

643
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,167
He knows you're in jail,

644
00:55:39,334 --> 00:55:40,959
he knows about Sinn Ying,

645
00:55:41,126 --> 00:55:42,606
and plans to use her to threaten you.

646
00:55:42,834 --> 00:55:44,167
He knows you very well.

647
00:55:47,167 --> 00:55:48,167
Wait...

648
00:55:48,459 --> 00:55:49,916
He sets out to kill martial artists,

649
00:55:49,917 --> 00:55:51,376
I'm not surprised he knows me.

650
00:55:52,084 --> 00:55:53,584
Are you suspecting me?

651
00:55:57,292 --> 00:55:58,501
Madam, I'm very tired,

652
00:55:58,792 --> 00:56:00,501
can I see Sinn Ying?

653
00:56:03,334 --> 00:56:04,916
Big Guy, take him away!

654
00:56:04,917 --> 00:56:05,459
Yes, Madam!

655
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,751
Thank you, Madam!

656
00:56:16,917 --> 00:56:19,250
Tai Yue, dig up Hahou Mo's phone records,

657
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:21,541
visitors and correspondence
for the last 3 years.

658
00:56:21,542 --> 00:56:22,583
I want them now!

659
00:56:22,584 --> 00:56:23,584
Yes, Madam!

660
00:56:26,001 --> 00:56:27,876
If your dearly beloved is dead,

661
00:56:28,542 --> 00:56:31,667
I guarantee you can kill anyone.

662
00:56:32,126 --> 00:56:34,042
You'll be the first, asshole!

663
00:56:36,167 --> 00:56:37,709
I already told you

664
00:56:38,001 --> 00:56:40,126
the only way to stop me is

665
00:56:40,667 --> 00:56:42,209
to kill me.

666
00:56:48,917 --> 00:56:50,501
Madam, it's me.

667
00:56:50,709 --> 00:56:52,042
I was at the prison,

668
00:56:52,084 --> 00:56:54,042
they only keep the surveillance
tape for a month.

669
00:56:54,292 --> 00:56:55,959
Apply for access to HQ's supercomputer

670
00:56:56,167 --> 00:56:58,959
retrieve all the deleted files
from the last 3 years.

671
00:57:38,417 --> 00:57:41,126
Watch the news on TV tomorrow

672
00:57:41,376 --> 00:57:43,917
Last night, a bizarre
homicide took place...

673
00:57:44,084 --> 00:57:45,792
A body was found

674
00:57:45,959 --> 00:57:47,459
with multiple injuries.

675
00:57:47,584 --> 00:57:49,584
The victim is Mak Wing-yan...

676
00:57:58,876 --> 00:57:59,792
Sorry, Madam!

677
00:57:59,793 --> 00:58:00,834
Let's begin!

678
00:58:01,126 --> 00:58:02,500
The phone we found in the sauna

679
00:58:02,501 --> 00:58:04,041
contains an unregistered SIM.

680
00:58:04,042 --> 00:58:06,417
Just like with the Eaves Swallows,

681
00:58:06,667 --> 00:58:08,347
we only found partial prints on the phone.

682
00:58:08,459 --> 00:58:10,501
As for the scrap of cloth,

683
00:58:10,751 --> 00:58:12,083
Tai O's water quality

684
00:58:12,084 --> 00:58:14,292
matched the sea salt on the scrap.

685
00:58:14,584 --> 00:58:17,250
We checked Fung Yu-sau's
picture with Database,

686
00:58:17,251 --> 00:58:18,167
and finally found something.

687
00:58:18,292 --> 00:58:19,834
His real name is Yung Hoi-sang.

688
00:58:20,001 --> 00:58:22,542
He came to Hong Kong
from Hebei at the age of 16.

689
00:58:22,709 --> 00:58:25,458
Tai Fai, debrief other departments
after the meeting.

690
00:58:25,459 --> 00:58:26,584
Yes, Madam!

691
00:58:26,834 --> 00:58:29,042
Over the past 20 years,

692
00:58:29,251 --> 00:58:30,971
he has been coming in and out of Hong Kong,

693
00:58:31,167 --> 00:58:33,542
but stayed mainly in China.

694
00:58:34,126 --> 00:58:35,542
From his inheritance record,

695
00:58:35,917 --> 00:58:38,001
his grandmother had a house in Tai O.

696
00:58:38,292 --> 00:58:41,001
The sea salt we found matched the area.

697
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:42,666
We believe

698
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:44,042
that's where he's hiding.

699
00:58:44,501 --> 00:58:45,833
I repeat...

700
00:58:45,834 --> 00:58:47,626
Fung Yu-sau has not yet been convicted,

701
00:58:47,792 --> 00:58:48,876
he's only a suspect.

702
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:50,667
Our job is to arrest him,

703
00:58:50,876 --> 00:58:53,166
unless he attacks a police or injures
innocent bystander,

704
00:58:53,167 --> 00:58:54,876
otherwise, do not open fire!

705
00:59:12,751 --> 00:59:14,709
SDU standby outside!

706
00:59:19,084 --> 00:59:19,792
Let's get to work!

707
00:59:19,793 --> 00:59:20,917
Yes, Madam!

708
00:59:45,834 --> 00:59:47,167
Shum Suet's memorial tablet.

709
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:49,376
Madam, the memorial tablet.

710
00:59:51,042 --> 00:59:52,376
The flowers look fresh.

711
00:59:59,751 --> 01:00:03,417
Born October 18, 1987.

712
01:00:03,626 --> 01:00:06,334
Died September 25, 2014.

713
01:00:06,542 --> 01:00:07,917
She died recently.

714
01:00:11,834 --> 01:00:13,084
Big guy,

715
01:00:13,959 --> 01:00:15,084
Put that down!

716
01:00:17,626 --> 01:00:20,417
Tell everyone to put everything back.

717
01:00:20,626 --> 01:00:21,917
Yes, Madam!

718
01:00:25,084 --> 01:00:26,333
Shum Suet's ashes are still here,

719
01:00:26,334 --> 01:00:27,614
target may come back any minute.

720
01:00:27,626 --> 01:00:29,167
We must redeploy.

721
01:00:53,292 --> 01:00:54,972
Based on Shum Suet's personal particulars,

722
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,727
the day after tomorrow is her birthday.

723
01:00:56,792 --> 01:00:58,667
Fung Yu-sau is bound to come back then.

724
01:00:59,042 --> 01:01:02,626
Seal off a 1 km-radius area from
Fung Yu-sau's house.

725
01:01:02,751 --> 01:01:04,511
CIB will standby outside
the designated area.

726
01:01:04,667 --> 01:01:05,501
Yes, Madam!

727
01:01:05,502 --> 01:01:07,667
The Water Team will guard the 3 channels.

728
01:01:07,876 --> 01:01:08,626
Yes, Madam!

729
01:01:08,627 --> 01:01:11,917
Tai Yue and the Hit Team will split
into 4 teams of 3,

730
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:13,959
move in when Fung Yu-sau sets foot
inside the house.

731
01:01:14,126 --> 01:01:15,001
Yes, Madam!

732
01:01:15,002 --> 01:01:17,876
The area branches out into many paths

733
01:01:18,001 --> 01:01:19,292
and close to civilan dwellings.

734
01:01:19,501 --> 01:01:21,209
We mustn't let him get away.

735
01:01:21,459 --> 01:01:22,459
You all should notice,

736
01:01:22,667 --> 01:01:25,542
Fung Yu-sau is a highly dangerous
murder suspect.

737
01:01:33,626 --> 01:01:34,501
Thank you!

738
01:01:34,626 --> 01:01:36,334
I'll tie it for you.

739
01:01:36,667 --> 01:01:37,917
I can manage.

740
01:01:40,667 --> 01:01:41,667
Alright, you do it.

741
01:01:41,876 --> 01:01:44,917
You're always taking on everything.

742
01:01:48,834 --> 01:01:51,251
The day you become famous,

743
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:53,667
was the day you become alone in your world.

744
01:01:59,126 --> 01:02:00,542
Let's eat.

745
01:02:05,376 --> 01:02:07,417
You think Fung Yu-sau is your match?

746
01:02:13,584 --> 01:02:15,292
What are you trying to say?

747
01:02:18,084 --> 01:02:19,584
This is my business,

748
01:02:20,251 --> 01:02:21,459
not yours.

749
01:02:22,209 --> 01:02:23,542
This is Police business,

750
01:02:23,751 --> 01:02:25,251
not yours.

751
01:04:05,334 --> 01:04:07,084
Target entering Zone C.

752
01:04:44,917 --> 01:04:46,292
Target is gone.

753
01:04:46,876 --> 01:04:47,792
Fung Yu-sau is gone.

754
01:04:47,793 --> 01:04:49,792
Tai Yue, lead the Hit Team in a search.

755
01:04:53,584 --> 01:04:54,834
Look again!

756
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:58,167
Hurry!

757
01:05:09,501 --> 01:05:11,042
Lam Sir, take a look at this.

758
01:05:18,501 --> 01:05:20,042
Madam, a call for you.

759
01:05:22,417 --> 01:05:23,709
Arrest Hahou Mo at once.

760
01:05:23,876 --> 01:05:25,292
You were right.

761
01:05:25,459 --> 01:05:27,042
He saw Fung Yu-sau before.

762
01:05:27,209 --> 01:05:28,417
It's possible they're in on this together,

763
01:05:28,584 --> 01:05:31,251
aiming to break Hahou Mo out of jail.

764
01:05:31,542 --> 01:05:32,959
I'll send the information to your laptop.

765
01:05:33,126 --> 01:05:34,167
Thank you.

766
01:05:54,126 --> 01:05:56,042
Get up! Hands on your head!

767
01:05:57,126 --> 01:05:58,959
You're working with Fung Yu-sau!

768
01:05:59,084 --> 01:06:00,542
Look, Madam! It's Sinn Ying!

769
01:06:07,417 --> 01:06:09,292
Don't move, put down the gun!

770
01:06:20,959 --> 01:06:22,084
I'll do it!

771
01:06:28,792 --> 01:06:30,001
Freeze!

772
01:06:31,876 --> 01:06:33,126
Freeze!

773
01:06:46,292 --> 01:06:47,417
Freeze!

774
01:06:53,084 --> 01:06:54,792
Tai Fai, arrest Hahou Mo at once!

775
01:06:55,501 --> 01:06:56,459
Listen up!

776
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:58,292
He's likely to be an accomplice
and highly dangerous.

777
01:06:58,459 --> 01:07:00,626
Shoot him if he resists.

778
01:07:41,376 --> 01:07:42,917
I have her ashes,

779
01:07:43,376 --> 01:07:45,667
leave Hahou Mo alone!

780
01:07:50,417 --> 01:07:51,667
He'll only become stronger

781
01:07:52,376 --> 01:07:54,376
when you're dead!

782
01:08:12,542 --> 01:08:13,501
Hahou Mo got away!

783
01:08:13,502 --> 01:08:15,292
Officers down! Send backup!

784
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:46,834
Are you alright?

785
01:08:47,376 --> 01:08:48,542
Stand up!

786
01:09:03,626 --> 01:09:06,292
Yours is fancy boxing,

787
01:09:06,917 --> 01:09:08,292
real martial arts is

788
01:09:08,876 --> 01:09:10,792
for killing.

789
01:09:42,584 --> 01:09:44,292
You'll be alright...

790
01:09:45,501 --> 01:09:47,334
Madam, this is Tai Yue.

791
01:09:47,501 --> 01:09:49,001
We can't find Hahou Mo in Zone B.

792
01:09:51,501 --> 01:09:52,667
Freeze!

793
01:10:01,834 --> 01:10:03,501
What's your situation?

794
01:10:05,417 --> 01:10:07,751
We need backup!

795
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:11,084
Calling control, officers down in Zone A.

796
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:15,334
Hello? Someone is hurt!

797
01:10:17,709 --> 01:10:19,001
- Fung Yu-sau's house!
- Send an ambulance.

798
01:10:19,167 --> 01:10:20,001
I can't hear you, please repeat that!

799
01:10:20,002 --> 01:10:22,209
Fung Yu-sau's house!

800
01:10:22,542 --> 01:10:24,584
Teams A, B & C, do you copy?

801
01:10:25,001 --> 01:10:26,209
Snipers, do you copy?

802
01:10:26,334 --> 01:10:27,666
Do you copy?

803
01:10:27,667 --> 01:10:29,084
Let's go over there now!

804
01:10:45,417 --> 01:10:47,834
Don't go!

805
01:11:19,376 --> 01:11:21,042
We're on our way over!

806
01:12:01,751 --> 01:12:03,126
Officers in the water,

807
01:12:05,126 --> 01:12:07,042
we need the Lantau Marine Police.

808
01:12:07,126 --> 01:12:08,334
Come on!

809
01:12:16,834 --> 01:12:19,001
Intercept him before he leaves
the typhoon shelter.

810
01:13:21,542 --> 01:13:23,376
I'm not his accomplice.

811
01:13:24,209 --> 01:13:25,917
I can explain everything.

812
01:13:26,834 --> 01:13:28,291
I admit he came to see me in jail.

813
01:13:28,292 --> 01:13:29,084
Madam.

814
01:13:29,251 --> 01:13:30,375
He said he worshiped me

815
01:13:30,376 --> 01:13:31,736
and wanted to follow my footsteps.

816
01:13:32,001 --> 01:13:34,251
He wanted to beat those I have beaten,

817
01:13:34,876 --> 01:13:37,376
and then come to challenge
me and be the NO.1.

818
01:13:37,876 --> 01:13:40,876
Hahou Mo,

819
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:44,042
you're regarded as the No.1 martial artist.

820
01:13:44,917 --> 01:13:47,542
We'll fight to the death.

821
01:13:47,834 --> 01:13:49,126
This is the whole thing goes.

822
01:13:49,376 --> 01:13:51,876
Why didn't you tell me about
this from the start?

823
01:13:52,584 --> 01:13:54,084
I admit I have a personal agenda.

824
01:13:54,667 --> 01:13:56,083
If I told you

825
01:13:56,084 --> 01:13:57,584
I have met him before,

826
01:13:58,292 --> 01:13:59,584
then you won't need me

827
01:14:00,084 --> 01:14:01,292
and get me out.

828
01:14:01,417 --> 01:14:03,251
I won't have a chance to protect Sinn Ying.

829
01:14:03,417 --> 01:14:04,751
He threatened me with Sinn Ying.

830
01:14:05,459 --> 01:14:07,584
Sinn Ying is in Fo Shan.

831
01:14:08,459 --> 01:14:10,126
If you won't fight me,

832
01:14:10,584 --> 01:14:11,709
I'll kill her.

833
01:14:13,626 --> 01:14:16,001
You wanted to fight him from the start.

834
01:14:18,876 --> 01:14:19,876
Listen to me!

835
01:14:20,001 --> 01:14:21,833
I did this all for Sinn Ying.

836
01:14:21,834 --> 01:14:23,709
I thought if I helped
you catch Fung Yu-sau,

837
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:25,709
Sinn Ying would be safe.

838
01:14:26,584 --> 01:14:28,083
But Fung Yu-sau killed so many people,

839
01:14:28,084 --> 01:14:29,644
She was in danger and I can do nothing.

840
01:14:30,542 --> 01:14:32,302
Sinn Ying is the most
important thing to me.

841
01:14:32,626 --> 01:14:34,209
She is the most important thing to me.

842
01:14:34,459 --> 01:14:41,042
Hahou Mo!

843
01:14:48,626 --> 01:14:49,792
Come over here.

844
01:14:51,542 --> 01:14:52,626
Lam Sir!

845
01:14:55,334 --> 01:14:57,292
I really think you need time off.

846
01:14:59,209 --> 01:15:00,959
You're taking over?

847
01:15:02,792 --> 01:15:03,876
The brass thinks

848
01:15:04,001 --> 01:15:06,334
I've been negligent too,

849
01:15:06,959 --> 01:15:08,584
though I'm not directly in charge.

850
01:15:09,626 --> 01:15:12,167
They're shipping me off to
an anti-terrorist drill.

851
01:15:12,334 --> 01:15:14,251
I'm taking the night train to Guangzhou.

852
01:15:15,834 --> 01:15:17,500
We're both off the case?

853
01:15:17,501 --> 01:15:19,292
It'll slow down our progress.

854
01:15:21,042 --> 01:15:22,584
Everyone stays on

855
01:15:22,834 --> 01:15:24,501
except you and me.

856
01:15:28,501 --> 01:15:29,626
Madam.

857
01:15:33,959 --> 01:15:35,667
Lock down Lantau Island

858
01:15:35,917 --> 01:15:37,167
and send choppers to conduct a search.

859
01:15:37,334 --> 01:15:38,959
Call Lantau Police for backup.

860
01:15:39,084 --> 01:15:40,334
The suspects are still on the island,

861
01:15:40,459 --> 01:15:42,001
we must find them ASAP.

862
01:15:42,209 --> 01:15:45,251
Lam Sir, can your team back us up?

863
01:15:45,501 --> 01:15:46,292
No problem!

864
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:47,292
Thank you! Get to work!

865
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:48,542
Yes, Sir!

866
01:16:23,459 --> 01:16:24,876
I know you know him.

867
01:16:25,042 --> 01:16:26,709
Why didn't you tell me?

868
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:30,682
He was really obsessed with martial arts.

869
01:16:31,292 --> 01:16:33,542
He kept writing me and asked me questions.

870
01:16:38,917 --> 01:16:40,117
I didn't know he's a murderer.

871
01:16:40,501 --> 01:16:41,501
I can't believe

872
01:16:41,709 --> 01:16:44,084
I helped a killer.

873
01:16:48,209 --> 01:16:49,459
It's not your fault.

874
01:16:49,667 --> 01:16:51,584
You are right to work with the Police.

875
01:16:52,709 --> 01:16:54,209
Don't blame yourself.

876
01:17:06,709 --> 01:17:08,084
I don't know,

877
01:17:08,584 --> 01:17:10,376
I think I need do something to compensate.

878
01:17:12,292 --> 01:17:13,626
You promised me

879
01:17:13,917 --> 01:17:15,667
you'll restrain your fists.

880
01:17:20,251 --> 01:17:21,292
Do it for me!

881
01:17:21,626 --> 01:17:22,959
Don't fight him.

882
01:17:29,126 --> 01:17:30,917
Martial arts is meant to kill,

883
01:17:32,834 --> 01:17:34,459
not a kid's brawl.

884
01:17:35,501 --> 01:17:37,209
We must decide who lives and who dies.

885
01:17:41,667 --> 01:17:43,209
<i>Fung Yu-sau was fight.</i>

886
01:17:44,167 --> 01:17:46,292
Martial arts is meant to kill.

887
01:17:47,792 --> 01:17:50,084
I should have killed him
the minute I got out.

888
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:54,292
Then he couldn't have hurt Sinn Ying.

889
01:18:49,209 --> 01:18:50,709
Boxing, kicking,

890
01:18:51,501 --> 01:18:52,917
grappling then weapon.

891
01:18:53,126 --> 01:18:55,584
From the outside to the inside...

892
01:18:59,626 --> 01:19:03,709
Boxing, kicking, grappling then weapon.

893
01:19:03,959 --> 01:19:05,279
From the outside to the inside...

894
01:19:05,501 --> 01:19:08,001
What's inside?

895
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:10,709
Who's next?

896
01:19:19,084 --> 01:19:22,709
"Hung Yip, Wong Chit,
Tam King-yiu, Mak Wing-yam..."

897
01:19:24,001 --> 01:19:25,251
Siu Hok-nin?

898
01:19:40,667 --> 01:19:42,376
"Siu Hok-nin, car plate GB6729"

899
01:20:12,792 --> 01:20:14,292
The fact that you didn't run me over,

900
01:20:15,709 --> 01:20:17,334
means you're ready

901
01:20:17,542 --> 01:20:18,834
to take me on.

902
01:20:19,126 --> 01:20:20,917
Running you over is too easy for you.

903
01:20:23,792 --> 01:20:25,334
I'm here to kill you.

904
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:26,751
Good!

905
01:20:28,959 --> 01:20:30,667
We fight

906
01:20:31,917 --> 01:20:33,501
to the death!

907
01:20:45,001 --> 01:20:46,584
Madam Luk Yuen-sum?

908
01:20:47,417 --> 01:20:48,376
Speaking.

909
01:20:48,377 --> 01:20:49,501
I'm Siu Hok-nin,

910
01:20:49,959 --> 01:20:51,542
Hahou Mo asked me to call you.

911
01:21:41,084 --> 01:21:42,084
This is fun!

912
01:23:29,501 --> 01:23:31,042
We're not finished!

913
01:24:01,626 --> 01:24:02,959
"Superintendent Chan"

914
01:24:05,042 --> 01:24:06,042
Rewind it,

915
01:24:06,167 --> 01:24:07,709
let me hear what he said.

916
01:24:09,126 --> 01:24:10,334
Right here...

917
01:27:17,001 --> 01:27:18,709
This is the Hahou Mo

918
01:27:18,834 --> 01:27:21,876
I've been waiting for.

919
01:27:24,042 --> 01:27:25,292
Come on!

920
01:27:25,917 --> 01:27:28,084
Kill me and you'll win.

921
01:27:41,626 --> 01:27:42,751
Come on!

922
01:27:47,042 --> 01:27:49,292
Hopefully the string

923
01:27:50,084 --> 01:27:51,626
can restrain your fists.

924
01:27:54,126 --> 01:27:55,542
No!

925
01:29:12,167 --> 01:29:13,626
Hahou Mo,

926
01:29:15,167 --> 01:29:17,667
you didn't let me down after all.

927
01:29:21,667 --> 01:29:23,792
You're by far

928
01:29:24,751 --> 01:29:26,209
the strongest of my opponents.

929
01:29:28,167 --> 01:29:29,167
But

930
01:29:30,542 --> 01:29:32,792
martial arts is...

931
01:29:34,876 --> 01:29:37,959
meant to kill.

932
01:29:38,834 --> 01:29:40,584
I'll kill you

933
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,042
even if you wouldn't kill me.

934
01:30:09,459 --> 01:30:11,708
Hahou Mo, can you hear me?

935
01:30:11,709 --> 01:30:14,001
Hang in there, the ambulance is on its way.

936
01:30:14,209 --> 01:30:16,501
Hahou Mo, don't close your eyes.

937
01:30:17,834 --> 01:30:20,459
I'm No. 1.

938
01:30:25,709 --> 01:30:26,791
<i>Fung Yu-sau,</i>

939
01:30:26,792 --> 01:30:29,417
put your hands on your head.

940
01:30:34,167 --> 01:30:36,084
Or I'll shoot.

941
01:31:01,626 --> 01:31:04,251
Hahou Mo...

942
01:31:43,292 --> 01:31:45,792
"3 months later"

943
01:31:52,167 --> 01:31:54,459
Hahou Mou, you have visitors.

944
01:31:56,792 --> 01:31:59,291
Hey, what about my left arm?

945
01:31:59,292 --> 01:32:01,334
I'll fix it when I come back.

946
01:32:19,251 --> 01:32:20,542
Sit down.

947
01:32:24,334 --> 01:32:26,626
Thanks for looking after Sinn Ying.

948
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:29,417
I've kicked off the judicial procedure,

949
01:32:29,584 --> 01:32:31,084
for the Police to review your case.

950
01:32:31,251 --> 01:32:32,792
You should get out soon.

951
01:32:33,084 --> 01:32:34,583
I hope you'll come back

952
01:32:34,584 --> 01:32:36,542
as an instructor.

953
01:32:38,792 --> 01:32:40,626
That was Lam Sir's idea.

954
01:32:41,751 --> 01:32:43,292
I always go by the book.

955
01:32:45,209 --> 01:32:46,501
Thank you.

956
01:32:48,751 --> 01:32:50,167
Thank you.

957
01:32:54,834 --> 01:32:56,209
One looks for nothing

958
01:32:56,542 --> 01:32:58,626
but safety and happiness.

959
01:32:59,376 --> 01:33:01,792
Being No. 1 is a lonely business.

960
01:33:02,334 --> 01:33:04,084
There is so much one must forsake

961
01:33:04,626 --> 01:33:06,917
to stand on that narrow peak.

962
01:33:12,042 --> 01:33:13,209
I'd rather

963
01:33:13,584 --> 01:33:15,501
take someone's hands

964
01:33:16,001 --> 01:33:17,876
and brave the world together,

965
01:33:20,917 --> 01:33:23,459
creating the happiness

966
01:33:24,042 --> 01:33:26,667
and bearing the bitterness.

967
01:33:28,334 --> 01:33:30,001
The thought of being No. 1

968
01:33:30,959 --> 01:33:32,917
never crossed my mind again.

969
01:33:32,941 --> 01:35:32,941

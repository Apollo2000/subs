00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,730
This is pointless. It's our last day
here, we should get lunch.

620
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:30,151
JEFF: Hi, can you connect me to the
vice president of the United States?

621
00:54:31,281 --> 00:54:33,136
Yeah, his office please.

622
00:54:33,316 --> 00:54:35,172
Thank you.

623
00:54:35,752 --> 00:54:37,974
- JEFF: It's ringing.
- What?

624
00:54:38,054 --> 00:54:39,932
JEFF: It's ringing.

625
00:54:43,926 --> 00:54:45,449
Hello?

626
00:54:46,029 --> 00:54:49,320
Yes, we're from William Dawes High in Ohio.

627
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,189
Just in the middle of nowhere.

628
00:54:52,569 --> 00:54:56,526
Yes, we're honor students,
and part of the school newspaper...

629
00:54:56,606 --> 00:54:58,662
...and we're very interested in politics.

630
00:54:58,742 --> 00:55:00,997
And we were wondering if we
could interview you as an aide...

631
00:55:01,077 --> 00:55:03,289
...to the vice president
of the United States?

632
00:55:05,214 --> 00:55:06,903
Yes.

633
00:55:06,983 --> 00:55:09,442
Uh-huh. We are...

634
00:55:13,222 --> 00:55:15,079
...one minute...

635
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:18,248
...on Constitutional Avenue.

636
00:55:18,628 --> 00:55:20,151
Uh-huh.

637
00:55:21,331 --> 00:55:23,821
Okay. Great.

638
00:55:23,901 --> 00:55:25,489
Great.

639
00:55:26,569 --> 00:55:28,261
We're in.

640
00:55:28,341 --> 00:55:31,361
- We're in.
- GIRL: What? Come on.

641
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:35,859
- Dahmer's got balls, man, he's slick.
- We have an appointment in an hour.

642
00:55:35,939 --> 00:55:38,992
So you get to sit in meetings
with the vice president?

643
00:55:39,072 --> 00:55:40,870
Sometimes.

644
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:42,572
Really?

645
00:55:42,652 --> 00:55:46,543
- Where is his office?
- WOMAN: Oh, wait! Mr. Vice President.

646
00:55:46,623 --> 00:55:49,046
Sorry. Excuse me.

647
00:55:49,826 --> 00:55:52,882
Just a second. These kids
are with the newspaper...

648
00:55:52,962 --> 00:55:55,819
- ...their school newspaper from...
- JEFF: Ohio.

649
00:55:55,899 --> 00:56:00,757
Ohio. That's a great state. Our fellow
Midwesterners, I'm from Minnesota.

650
00:56:00,837 --> 00:56:04,995
So you want to pursue journalism
when you grow up, or what?

651
00:56:05,075 --> 00:56:08,698
Well, I want to draw cartoons,
but not for TV.

652
00:56:08,778 --> 00:56:11,034
I want to draw comics.

653
00:56:11,114 --> 00:56:14,003
Well, that's great, as long as you
don't draw any political ones about me.

654
00:56:14,083 --> 00:56:15,772
- I won't do that.
- MONDALE: Young lady?

655
00:56:15,852 --> 00:56:18,942
- I want to be a teacher.
- MONDALE: That's nice.

656
00:56:19,422 --> 00:56:21,250
I really don't know.

657
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:24,247
Don't worry, you got plenty
of time to figure it out.

658
00:56:24,327 --> 00:56:29,152
Professor? You know, or my dad
wants me to go into real estate.

659
00:56:29,232 --> 00:56:31,088
MONDALE: What about you?

660
00:56:31,668 --> 00:56:35,193
- Biology.
- Great. You ought to pursue that.

661
00:56:36,273 --> 00:56:41,030
I'm sure you'll be happy no matter what you
choose. You might want to consider politics.

662
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:43,413
An admirable profession, young lady.

663
00:56:43,613 --> 00:56:46,035
- Enjoy D.C-, kids.
- Thank you, sir.

664
00:56:46,115 --> 00:56:47,960
Nice to meet you.

665
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:52,542
- GIRL: Thank you.
- WOMAN: You're welcome.

666
00:56:52,622 --> 00:56:55,244
Thank you. Thank you.

667
00:56:55,324 --> 00:56:57,147
Thank you so much.

668
00:56:58,127 --> 00:56:59,638
Yes.

669
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,879
Hey. Dahmer.

670
00:57:09,071 --> 00:57:12,395
I'm Professor Mondale and you're gonna
have a very bright future ahead of you.

671
00:57:12,475 --> 00:57:14,353
Thank you, Son.

672
00:57:20,549 --> 00:57:22,373
How'd it go?

673
00:57:23,653 --> 00:57:25,475
You all right?

674
00:57:26,155 --> 00:57:27,966
It was great.

675
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,332
You know...

676
00:57:33,419 --> 00:57:35,285
...that it has been difficult
with your mother.

677
00:57:35,365 --> 00:57:39,656
I don't want to say anything bad about her.

678
00:57:40,436 --> 00:57:41,947
Just...

679
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,131
Is she going back to the hospital?

680
00:57:48,111 --> 00:57:50,500
Not exactly.

681
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:52,669
When you were younger...

682
00:57:53,749 --> 00:57:57,541
...but then life gets in the...

683
00:57:57,621 --> 00:58:00,305
I work and...

684
00:58:03,312 --> 00:58:05,899
...so while you were away,
I moved into a motel.

685
00:58:05,979 --> 00:58:08,661
It's just down the block.

686
00:58:10,133 --> 00:58:13,395
I just thought it would be easier...

687
00:58:14,104 --> 00:58:15,976
...while you were away.

688
00:58:16,973 --> 00:58:18,817
You okay?

689
00:58:22,211 --> 00:58:24,023
It'll be amicable.

690
00:58:33,421 --> 00:58:35,303
JOYCE: Hey, kid.

691
00:58:36,493 --> 00:58:39,505
I know you spoke to your dad. You okay?

692
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:44,242
Aw.

693
00:58:52,507 --> 00:58:54,999
Do you want to talk to somebody about it now?

694
00:58:55,279 --> 00:58:57,934
- JEFF: Hmm.
- Okay.

695
00:58:58,014 --> 00:58:59,858
Get some sleep, honey.

696
00:59:26,141 --> 00:59:27,864
DR. MATTHEWS: Hello.

697
00:59:27,944 --> 00:59:31,207
- You're running a cold, huh?
- I think so.

698
00:59:32,282 --> 00:59:34,360
I've been getting chills.

699
00:59:36,352 --> 00:59:37,870
DR. MATTHEWS: Well...

700
00:59:38,787 --> 00:59:40,851
...it's always good to see your patients.

701
00:59:43,859 --> 00:59:46,138
So, a physical maybe?

702
00:59:54,736 --> 00:59:56,793
Stick out your tongue, say "ah."

703
00:59:56,873 --> 00:59:58,895
JEFF: Ah.

704
00:59:58,975 --> 01:00:00,986
Okay. Tonsils look good.

705
01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:04,700
All right.

706
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:06,992
Turn your head. Let's look in those ears.

707
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:11,740
Do you do surgery?

708
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,344
No.

709
01:00:14,424 --> 01:00:16,412
Why not?

710
01:00:16,492 --> 01:00:18,648
Turn your head.

711
01:00:18,728 --> 01:00:21,058
Well, I like caring for people, but...

712
01:00:21,138 --> 01:00:24,721
...I'm not the type of person who
wants to cut someone open, so this.

713
01:00:24,801 --> 01:00:27,625
Well, I almost became a podiatrist.

714
01:00:28,405 --> 01:00:31,194
- Less blood.
- Yeah.

715
01:00:31,574 --> 01:00:33,139
Exactly.

716
01:00:34,977 --> 01:00:38,991
- What about what's on a patient's mind?
- You mean a psychiatrist?

717
01:00:43,051 --> 01:00:45,531
Okay. Just relax, okay?

718
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:54,739
Take a deep breath.

719
01:00:56,932 --> 01:01:00,179
Good. And another deep breath.

720
01:01:04,806 --> 01:01:07,432
Well, you seem healthy to me.

721
01:01:08,912 --> 01:01:10,925
Now before I weigh you...

722
01:01:12,534 --> 01:01:14,606
...does it hurt when you urinate?

723
01:01:15,018 --> 01:01:16,773
Uh, no.

724
01:01:16,853 --> 01:01:18,409
Okay.

725
01:01:19,789 --> 01:01:22,106
And are you sexually active?

726
01:01:23,326 --> 01:01:24,933
What kind?

727
01:01:29,565 --> 01:01:31,454
Sort of.

728
01:01:32,134 --> 01:01:35,804
Well, you're at that age.
Okay. Drop your underpants.

729
01:01:47,148 --> 01:01:48,738
Okay. (CLEARS THROAT)

730
01:01:49,408 --> 01:01:50,941
- Cough.
- (JEFF COUGHS)

731
01:01:52,521 --> 01:01:54,544
- Okay, good. Cough again.
- (COUGH)

732
01:01:55,324 --> 01:01:57,147
And cough one more time.

733
01:01:57,727 --> 01:01:59,772
(COUGH)

734
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:07,496
I'm finished. You can pull up your pants.

735
01:02:31,093 --> 01:02:33,108
(JEFF PANTING)

736
01:02:39,867 --> 01:02:41,491
- (KNOCK ON THE DOOR)
- JOYCE: Jeff, dinner.

737
01:02:41,571 --> 01:02:45,094
- JEFF: Just... a minute. Go away.
- (KNOCK)

738
01:02:45,174 --> 01:02:47,452
- JOYCE: Jeff?
- JEFF: Go away!

739
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,864
(GRUNTING)

740
01:03:06,461 --> 01:03:08,918
Jeffrey was really hot.

741
01:03:08,998 --> 01:03:11,655
Shut up, gross. No, she's not.

742
01:03:11,735 --> 01:03:13,355
Yeah.

743
01:03:13,435 --> 01:03:14,991
Yes.

744
01:03:15,571 --> 01:03:17,805
Neil, your mom's smoking too.

745
01:03:19,008 --> 01:03:21,564
Yeah. So is that car she drives.

746
01:03:21,644 --> 01:03:24,702
The Jaguar? The piece of shit?

747
01:03:25,182 --> 01:03:28,337
Your mom... your mom's extraordinarily hot.

748
01:03:28,417 --> 01:03:30,873
- Yeah, so...
- I've jerked off to your mom before.

749
01:03:30,953 --> 01:03:32,241
Jesus Christ.

750
01:03:32,321 --> 01:03:35,979
Well, I've jerked off in my room,
I've jerked off to your mom before.

751
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:38,815
Not gonna lie, I have too.

752
01:03:39,295 --> 01:03:41,550
- I banged her.
- That is true.

753
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:43,817
No. No, you didn't.

754
01:03:43,897 --> 01:03:47,106
Come on, Derf. What, you haven't
banged your best friend's mom?

755
01:03:47,186 --> 01:03:49,692
You guys haven't actually banged
your best friend's mom, right?

756
01:03:49,772 --> 01:03:51,527
You're just messing with me.

757
01:03:51,607 --> 01:03:53,496
- Of course not.
- Can you believe it?

758
01:03:53,576 --> 01:03:56,966
- I wish I had a best friend.
- Jesus, Dahmer.

759
01:03:57,046 --> 01:03:59,736
Forgot you were over there. Freaked me out.

760
01:03:59,816 --> 01:04:03,573
You guys want to head inside and raid
the fridge before my folks get home?

761
01:04:03,653 --> 01:04:05,608
- Put that out?
- Just give me one sec.

762
01:04:05,688 --> 01:04:07,565
Come on.

763
01:04:21,002 --> 01:04:22,860
Hold up.

764
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:25,995
What's Dahmer up to?

765
01:04:26,475 --> 01:04:31,200
I don't know. Something about last weekend
in your clubhouse kinda creeped me out.

766
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,936
Jeff's a little off, you know?

767
01:04:33,016 --> 01:04:35,873
Well, yeah, but that's what
we like about him, right?

768
01:04:36,953 --> 01:04:40,276
Do you guys think that
the way we treat him is mean?

769
01:04:40,356 --> 01:04:42,879
What? No. No. Why?

770
01:04:42,959 --> 01:04:45,964
- Are you sure?
- No. I...

771
01:04:47,644 --> 01:04:50,019
...I think... I think he seems to enjoy it.

772
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:53,156
I think if he didn't want to,
he wouldn't do it. Right?

773
01:04:53,236 --> 01:04:56,425
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

774
01:04:56,505 --> 01:04:58,328
I'm cool with it.

775
01:04:59,408 --> 01:05:01,764
Okay. Who wants the back seat of pain?

776
01:05:01,844 --> 01:05:03,399
Shotgun.

777
01:05:03,479 --> 01:05:05,290
I got shotgun.

778
01:05:26,902 --> 01:05:28,875
They here?

779
01:05:28,955 --> 01:05:31,027

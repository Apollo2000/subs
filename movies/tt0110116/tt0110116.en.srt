00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,002
"Ludwig van Beethoven,
the man who inherited...

3
00:01:21,086 --> 00:01:25,924
and increased the immortal fame
of Handel and Bach...

4
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:29,930
of Haydn and Mozart,
is now no more.

5
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:50,572
He was an artist,
and who will stand beside him?

6
00:01:50,615 --> 00:01:53,367
He was an artist...

7
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,704
and what he was,
he was only through music.

8
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:02,291
The thorns of life
had wounded him deeply...

9
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:05,293
so he held fast to his art...

10
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:09,591
even when the gate through which
it entered was shut.

11
00:02:09,673 --> 00:02:14,262
Music spoke through a deafened ear
to he who could no longer hear it.

12
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:18,474
He carried the music
in his heart.

13
00:03:28,954 --> 00:03:33,626
Because he shut himself off
from the world, they called him hostile.

14
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:36,087
They said he was unfeeling...

15
00:03:36,171 --> 00:03:37,421
and called him callous.

16
00:03:38,796 --> 00:03:42,634
But he was not hard of heart.

17
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:49,056
It is the finest blades
that are most easily blunted...

18
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:53,061
bent or broken.

19
00:04:03,863 --> 00:04:09,034
He withdrew from his fellow man
after he had given them everything...

20
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:12,746
and had received nothing in return.

21
00:04:12,828 --> 00:04:14,497
He lived alone...

22
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:17,665
because he found no second self.

23
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:21,793
Thus he was, thus he died.

24
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:24,587
Thus he will live for all time".

25
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:55,758
Which one of you is the thief?

26
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:58,092
Huh?

27
00:06:00,553 --> 00:06:03,930
Produce the money,
or I will have you arrested!

28
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,519
Then arrest me!

29
00:06:07,602 --> 00:06:11,896
I took him in when nobody
could bear his company!

30
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:14,107
And now you want to get paid, eh?

31
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:18,237
- Bank shares.
- Give them to me!

32
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,198
The money is mine!

33
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,326
Here. Here is his will.

34
00:06:26,827 --> 00:06:30,248
"I declare that my brothers
Caspar and Johann...

35
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:33,959
are the heirs to my fortune,
if so it can be called".

36
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:38,589
As Caspar is long dead,
that leaves me! Just me!

37
00:06:38,673 --> 00:06:43,300
Well, give me my money!
Answer!

38
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:47,597
This is his final testament.

39
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,098
What?

40
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,937
"All my music
and all the capital of my estate..

41
00:06:56,021 --> 00:07:00,652
shall go to my sole heir,
my immortal beloved".

42
00:07:00,694 --> 00:07:03,445
Signed, "Ludwig van Beethoven".

43
00:07:03,528 --> 00:07:05,448
A letter is enclosed.

44
00:07:07,532 --> 00:07:09,284
- This is...
- Come on, now.

45
00:07:09,368 --> 00:07:11,328
Don't keep me in suspense.
Who is it?

46
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:14,331
- Nobody.
- Oh, not so.

47
00:07:14,415 --> 00:07:15,917
The letter bears no name.

48
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:18,500
"To my immortal beloved".

49
00:07:26,134 --> 00:07:30,970
"My angel, my all,
my other self".

50
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:36,978
The maestro was nursing
a secret passion.

51
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,647
I never heard such words from his lips.
Who could this be?

52
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,192
The only love he held
was for himself.

53
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:48,195
I suffered his insults, his temper.

54
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:52,031
I suffered in silence when he spat
the food I made back in my face.

55
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:54,367
That money is ours!

56
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:55,995
It is not.

57
00:07:56,077 --> 00:08:00,373
It doesn't matter anymore.
He is gone.

58
00:08:00,457 --> 00:08:02,375
We have his music.

59
00:08:05,002 --> 00:08:06,420
Destroy this letter.

60
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,342
It would only show
his disordered life to the world.

61
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:15,595
It's his dying wish.
We owe him at least that.

62
00:08:15,678 --> 00:08:17,888
You have no authority in this matter.

63
00:08:17,974 --> 00:08:19,974
I have his authority.

64
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:23,311
Still the faithful dog, eh?

65
00:08:24,102 --> 00:08:25,356
He was my friend.

66
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,564
What friend would be so cruel?

67
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:30,359
What brother so uncaring?

68
00:08:30,445 --> 00:08:32,903
You know nothing of my brother!

69
00:08:52,295 --> 00:08:55,089
Take me to Karlsbad.

70
00:09:03,805 --> 00:09:08,769
"My angel, my all, my other self.

71
00:09:08,811 --> 00:09:13,065
Just a few words today
and that in pencil, yours.

72
00:09:14,482 --> 00:09:18,280
Only tomorrow will I know for certain
where I am to stay.

73
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,239
A worthless waste of time
and such.

74
00:09:22,323 --> 00:09:24,742
Why this deep sorrow?

75
00:09:24,826 --> 00:09:29,913
If we could be united,
we would feel this pain no longer".

76
00:09:36,713 --> 00:09:39,507
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon, Frau...

77
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:41,050
Streicher.

78
00:09:41,134 --> 00:09:45,094
- Herr Schindler.
- Let me find your reservation.

79
00:09:45,176 --> 00:09:47,472
I'm afraid I don't have
a reservation.

80
00:09:47,557 --> 00:09:52,684
Oh, no matter. We have always room
for a gentleman such as yourself.

81
00:09:52,768 --> 00:09:55,771
Is this the address for this hotel?

82
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,486
One moment.

83
00:10:00,568 --> 00:10:02,611
Ja, of course.

84
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:05,864
Do you know the name
Ludwig van Beethoven?

85
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:08,199
- The composer?
- Yes.

86
00:10:08,284 --> 00:10:10,661
I knew him.

87
00:10:10,701 --> 00:10:14,829
- Did he ever stay here?
- Are you a policeman?

88
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,002
Then I will not answer your questions.

89
00:10:19,043 --> 00:10:22,296
Oh, please, I'm trying
to conclude his affairs.

90
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:24,297
Ah, van Beethoven is dead.

91
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:26,383
Alas, yes.

92
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:29,218
Best thing for him.
He was a terrible man.

93
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:31,513
Then he stayed here?

94
00:10:31,554 --> 00:10:35,266
A long time ago.
Too long to remember.

95
00:10:35,349 --> 00:10:37,394
I can remember only the damage.

96
00:10:37,476 --> 00:10:39,144
The damage?

97
00:10:39,187 --> 00:10:42,565
I was never paid for the damage.

98
00:10:42,647 --> 00:10:45,609
He smashed it all up, everything.

99
00:10:45,694 --> 00:10:50,155
There was a chair, three florins.
Window, five.

100
00:10:50,196 --> 00:10:52,949
- I had to paint everything.
- Frau Streicher.

101
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:56,995
Would this be sufficient?

102
00:11:07,795 --> 00:11:09,548
There was a woman.

103
00:11:11,175 --> 00:11:16,053
We had been expecting
Herr van Beethoven for days.

104
00:11:16,097 --> 00:11:17,889
She came instead.

105
00:11:19,514 --> 00:11:23,186
She said he was to join her.

106
00:11:23,227 --> 00:11:26,815
She registered in his room.

107
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:29,483
Under what name?

108
00:11:29,568 --> 00:11:31,820
illegible. Then...

109
00:11:33,236 --> 00:11:37,533
there was this terrible storm,
a deluge.

110
00:11:37,616 --> 00:11:39,451
The woman hid in her room...

111
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,497
waiting.

112
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:45,832
Ashamed to show her face,
I'd say.

113
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:51,128
And then, the letter arrived.

114
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,430
You opened the letter.

115
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,852
I had to. How else would I know
who it was for?

116
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:09,814
I only read his signature.

117
00:12:12,355 --> 00:12:16,778
"My angel, my all, my other self.

118
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:18,737
Just a few words...

119
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,324
and that in pencil..."

120
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,118
I sent it to her room at once.

121
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:02,445
She can't have liked what she read.

122
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:06,656
She left at once, right away.

123
00:13:06,742 --> 00:13:09,244
Left without a word to anybody.

124
00:13:11,037 --> 00:13:15,624
And then, of course,
Herr van Beethoven arrives.

125
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:19,211
When he found she was gone,
he went mad.

126
00:13:19,293 --> 00:13:21,213
He was like a madman.

127
00:13:37,185 --> 00:13:40,354
Threw a chair out of the window.

128
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:44,068
I called the police.
I was frightened of him.

129
00:13:50,614 --> 00:13:53,366
Herr van Beethoven!

130
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,869
Open up!

131
00:14:29,274 --> 00:14:31,527
Here is her signature.

132
00:14:33,652 --> 00:14:36,196
Is that a "J" or a "G"?

133
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:40,115
It looks more like an "A" to me.

134
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:46,499
She was haughty like a countess.

135
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:48,125
What did she look like?

136
00:14:49,876 --> 00:14:53,257
Never got a proper look at her.

137
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:56,509
I don't think she wanted
to be recognized.

138
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:07,977
Herr Schindler.

139
00:15:10,145 --> 00:15:12,563
Lock the door.

140
00:15:12,607 --> 00:15:13,734
But, Countess...

141
00:15:14,318 --> 00:15:15,985
Lock the door.

142
00:15:20,365 --> 00:15:22,281
We must not be disturbed.

143
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:26,744
Not everything they say
about me is true.

144
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,879
Holz was here
with the other one, the weasel.

145
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:36,128
Johann.

146
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:39,048
How could Luigi
have such a vile brother?

147
00:15:39,132 --> 00:15:41,553
I hope they were in good health.

148
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:47,139
They say you have
stolen Luigi's money.

149
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,974
They thought you would come here.

150
00:15:50,058 --> 00:15:51,226
Why?

151
00:15:51,311 --> 00:15:53,855
I told them nothing.

152
00:15:53,937 --> 00:15:58,233
The price for my silence
is that you must tell me everything.

153
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:03,779
I'm afraid that's impossible.
It falls upon me to interrogate you.

154
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,573
Why should I submit to that?

155
00:16:08,492 --> 00:16:10,075
That is what he wanted.

156
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:11,621
Who?

157
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:13,998
The maestro.

158
00:16:17,918 --> 00:16:21,462
What I shall tell you
will never leave this room?

159
00:16:21,504 --> 00:16:25,675
On my word of honor, Contessa.

160
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:32,473
There is substance to the rumors.

161
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,018
I was the great love of Luigi's life.

162
00:16:57,371 --> 00:17:01,208
I first heard the name
Beethoven when I was 17.

163
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:06,964
I had heard that his music
aroused such passion as to be dangerous.

164
00:17:07,046 --> 00:17:10,883
Some thought it obscene
and unsuitable for the young.

165
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:39,326
I wrote to my cousins,
Theresa and Josephine.

166
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,705
They lived in Vienna,
the great music capital of the world.

167
00:17:45,622 --> 00:17:50,211
Surely they would know more.
Indeed they did.

168
00:17:50,295 --> 00:17:53,049
They knew him intimately.

169
00:17:53,132 --> 00:17:55,843
More intimately than
they admitted at the time.

170
00:18:43,134 --> 00:18:45,304
Most nights I dreamt of him.

171
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:48,516
And then,
Father was posted to Vienna.

172
00:18:50,977 --> 00:18:55,440
We were invited to Prince Lichnowsky's
palace for a musical evening.

173
00:18:55,522 --> 00:18:57,274
Beethoven was going to be there.

174
00:19:01,361 --> 00:19:03,029
I knew he must be so noble...

175
00:19:03,111 --> 00:19:06,240
so refined in feeling,
so cultured.

176
00:19:06,323 --> 00:19:10,368
I could hardly wait.
I was going to hear him play.

177
00:20:43,914 --> 00:20:48,752
That music affected me like
none I had ever heard before.

178
00:20:48,795 --> 00:20:51,211
And as for Beethoven...

179
00:20:52,255 --> 00:20:54,215
I was soon overcome.

180
00:20:54,256 --> 00:20:56,219
I feared I might faint.

181
00:21:04,182 --> 00:21:05,435
Hello.

182
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,061
Oh. I didn't see you.

183
00:21:10,105 --> 00:21:12,064
I have to go back.

184
00:21:13,274 --> 00:21:17,029
Oh, you are leaving me
to listen to that ass...

185
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:21,406
who plays like a kitchen maid,
all clipped and staccato.

186
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:23,951
This music is beautiful.

187
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:27,289
I was told that the Viennese
had superior taste.

188
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:30,708
Clearly in your case,
it is not true.

189
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:33,834
You must be Julia Guicciardi.

190
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,338
I hear there's quite a contest
for your charms.

191
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:41,218
Sir, you're rude and offensive.
I'm leaving.

192
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,430
- Do you play the piano?
- What?

193
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,391
I intend to be your teacher.

194
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:51,935
I shall call for you
tomorrow at 10:00.

195
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,480
You shall be barred from the house.

196
00:22:03,154 --> 00:22:05,657
I could not believe the outrage.

197
00:22:05,739 --> 00:22:10,036
This ugly man, surely a servant,
had called at the front door.

198
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:19,295
I have an appointment.

199
00:22:19,336 --> 00:22:21,797
She has a piano.

200
00:22:25,885 --> 00:22:27,845
A gentleman is here to see you.

201
00:22:27,968 --> 00:22:30,679
He says he's your new music teacher.

202
00:22:30,762 --> 00:22:33,848
Father, there has been a mistake.
This man is a common oat.

203
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:38,185
He accosted me last night.
Send him away at once.

204
00:22:38,228 --> 00:22:41,814
I will not! It would be a shame
on our household.

205
00:22:44,693 --> 00:22:47,112
Sir?

206
00:22:53,283 --> 00:22:57,539
May i present Ludwig van Beethoven?

207
00:23:21,728 --> 00:23:24,062
So you must attend my next recital.

208
00:23:24,104 --> 00:23:26,064
I heard you last week.

209
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:28,066
I remember.

210
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:30,276
The music was beautiful.

211
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:32,361
Surely not that bad.

212
00:23:32,404 --> 00:23:34,240
I found the playing exquisite.

213
00:23:36,073 --> 00:23:39,742
It's that damned Beethoven
I can't stand.

214
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:43,246
People only claim to admire his stuff
so as not to seem ignorant.

215
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:47,749
My dear husband, don't confirm
your stupidity in front of the guests.

216
00:23:52,047 --> 00:23:54,548
We all speak frankly here.

217
00:23:55,633 --> 00:23:57,092
Tell us your opinion.

218
00:23:57,176 --> 00:23:59,886
Heavens, no.
I was not looking for flattery.

219
00:24:02,055 --> 00:24:04,225
It was too clipped and staccato.

220
00:24:04,266 --> 00:24:07,687
There was not enough singing tone.

221
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:12,316
Julia, as you can see, is being taught
by the maestro himself.

222
00:24:13,525 --> 00:24:14,442
What?

223
00:24:14,526 --> 00:24:16,571
He comes every day to the house.

224
00:24:16,612 --> 00:24:18,654
Every day?

225
00:24:18,736 --> 00:24:21,117
Is that wise?

226
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:23,450
Why do you say that?

227
00:24:23,536 --> 00:24:25,619
He's a harsh teacher.

228
00:24:26,663 --> 00:24:29,499
He's a scoundrel
and a republican.

229
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,875
It is even said that he is
a follower of Napoleon.

230
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:35,086
He'd have us all in the arms
of Madame La Guillotine.

231
00:24:35,129 --> 00:24:39,214
He travels in polite society
on his reputation as a virtuoso...

232
00:24:39,298 --> 00:24:41,424
but flies into a fit if anyone...

233
00:24:41,468 --> 00:24:45,595
even dares suggest
he sit at the keyboard.

234
00:24:45,636 --> 00:24:48,640
Why will he no longer play?

235
00:24:48,683 --> 00:24:52,519
Beethoven is a strange
and obstinate man.

236
00:24:52,602 --> 00:24:54,979
He says it makes him
feel like a servant...

237
00:24:55,065 --> 00:24:57,149
and he serves no masters.

238
00:24:57,232 --> 00:24:59,150
But he takes the money.

239
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:38,728
You think because I did not stop you
that I am not listening.

240
00:25:40,812 --> 00:25:44,193
A mistake is nothing.

241
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:47,654
But the fact that
you thump out the notes...

242
00:25:47,695 --> 00:25:52,115
without the least sensitivity
to their meaning is unforgivable.

243
00:25:52,198 --> 00:25:56,493
And your lack of passion
is unforgivable.

244
00:25:58,747 --> 00:26:00,666
I shall have to beat you.

245
00:26:26,105 --> 00:26:28,442
I am writing a new symphony.

246
00:26:28,526 --> 00:26:31,110
It will cause a scandal
because of its subject.

247
00:26:31,192 --> 00:26:33,906
- Tell me.
- Here. Take my arm.

248
00:26:40,078 --> 00:26:42,581
They should make way for us,
not us for them!

249
00:26:42,663 --> 00:26:44,832
Their days are over.
Your world is finished!

250
00:26:44,915 --> 00:26:46,750
Oh, shut up!

251
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:51,338
When I was a boy, they would have
had you arrested for less.

252
00:26:51,421 --> 00:26:54,756
But now they are scared
of what is happening in France.

253
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,508
- You know why wigs went out of fashion?
- Why?

254
00:26:57,595 --> 00:27:00,180
Because too many ended up
in the bottom of baskets.

255
00:27:00,262 --> 00:27:02,516
But I am a countess, too, Luigi.

256
00:27:02,598 --> 00:27:06,477
They are scared.
Scared of Napoleon.

257
00:27:06,562 --> 00:27:09,480
That is why Napoleon
is the subject of my symphony.

258
00:27:49,225 --> 00:27:53,187
I have here
a proposal of marriage..

259
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:55,188
from a composer.

260
00:27:57,483 --> 00:28:00,275
- Count Gallenberg.
- Oh.

261
00:28:00,318 --> 00:28:02,195
You were thinking of Beethoven?

262
00:28:02,277 --> 00:28:05,282
Julia, the gossip is everywhere.

263
00:28:07,616 --> 00:28:12,245
- He also has proposed.
- Then there is no contest.

264
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:14,666
- You love Beethoven?
- Yes.

265
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,380
I cannot give my consent.

266
00:28:21,462 --> 00:28:23,549
We are not wealthy, Julia.

267
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:27,176
He is a man without rank,
fortune or permanent engagement.

268
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,512
His character and temperament
are so peculiar that I doubt...

269
00:28:30,597 --> 00:28:32,684
any would find happiness with him.

270
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:34,433
- He's a genius.
- Perhaps.

271
00:28:35,518 --> 00:28:39,981
But in the last year he has not
played nor published a single note.

272
00:28:40,021 --> 00:28:44,857
There are those who say there is
some infirmity that prevents him.

273
00:28:44,943 --> 00:28:48,030
Untrue gossip! Lies!

274
00:28:48,113 --> 00:28:50,114
Has he played for you?

275
00:28:53,492 --> 00:28:56,662
We made a bargain. If I could
prove Luigi could still play...

276
00:28:57,705 --> 00:28:59,625
Father would give his consent.

277
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,508
Obviously a fine countess.

278
00:29:14,387 --> 00:29:15,971
Dear brother...

279
00:29:16,057 --> 00:29:17,890
you are going up in the world.

280
00:29:17,974 --> 00:29:20,601
Hand it over, you ignoramus.

281
00:29:20,684 --> 00:29:24,230
As your secretary,
it is my solemn duty to read this.

282
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:31,570
"Beloved Luigi, my father
has recently taken delivery...

283
00:29:31,653 --> 00:29:35,405
of a new pianoforte
from Broadwood in London.

284
00:29:35,492 --> 00:29:39,618
It is of the latest design and is
the first of its kind in Vienna.

285
00:29:39,703 --> 00:29:44,831
Tomorrow morning I will send away
the servants and we shall all be out.

286
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:49,253
I have done this so that you might try
this new invention undisturbed".

287
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,790
What is the meaning of this? What
kind of trick have you played on me?

288
00:33:28,872 --> 00:33:30,624
Stop it, Luigi.

289
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:33,836
- Herr Beethoven, I beg you.
- Now I see.

290
00:33:33,918 --> 00:33:35,796
- I see perfectly.
- We mean you no harm.

291
00:33:35,878 --> 00:33:39,007
- A little test!
- Luigi, wait!

292
00:33:40,092 --> 00:33:43,928
It is terrible to rob me
in this way...

293
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,931
of my most treasured feelings!

294
00:33:48,138 --> 00:33:50,977
Father can go to hell!
I bid you wait!

295
00:33:51,061 --> 00:33:53,436
It's no use. He can't hear you!

296
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,439
He's deaf!

297
00:34:01,654 --> 00:34:05,741
A month later
I married Count Gallenberg.

298
00:34:05,822 --> 00:34:09,285
And you never heard from him again?

299
00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:10,827
He wrote to me.

300
00:34:10,911 --> 00:34:12,079
It was...

301
00:34:13,873 --> 00:34:16,666
After the war,
there had been some...

302
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,669
unpleasantness.

303
00:34:20,087 --> 00:34:22,131
It was a bad time.

304
00:34:31,681 --> 00:34:33,432
They who think me hostile...

305
00:34:34,309 --> 00:34:37,436
obstinate or misanthropic...

306
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:40,521
how unjust they are to me...

307
00:34:40,606 --> 00:34:45,067
for they do not know
the secret reason I appear that way.

308
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:49,529
It is not possible for me
to say, "Speak louder.

309
00:34:49,574 --> 00:34:51,532
Shout. I am deaf".

310
00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:56,954
How can I live if my enemies,
who are many...

311
00:34:57,038 --> 00:35:00,542
believe I no longer possess
the one sense that should be perfect...

312
00:35:00,627 --> 00:35:04,338
to a higher degree in me
than in others?

313
00:35:14,097 --> 00:35:17,889
Not so fast.
So what will you do?

314
00:35:17,932 --> 00:35:21,729
See every shallow countess
Ludwig gave a dedication to?

315
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:24,521
They are all liars
who want a piece of him now he is gone.

316
00:35:24,563 --> 00:35:27,567
I have the lady's signature.

317
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:31,194
I shall study his correspondence
to find the hand that matches.

318
00:35:31,277 --> 00:35:33,947
It is illegible.
You are wasting your time.

319
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:36,992
- No court will uphold this nonsense.
- Help me then.

320
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,702
Are you mad?

321
00:35:39,786 --> 00:35:44,164
Help you to cheat me?
I will tell you this.

322
00:35:44,249 --> 00:35:47,207
There is no lady
at the end of your search.

323
00:35:47,251 --> 00:35:50,504
Ludwig was a woman hater.
Look at how he behaved with Johanna.

324
00:35:50,586 --> 00:35:54,839
He had every right. Your brother
took a bride of low character.

325
00:35:54,926 --> 00:35:58,095
You are too much under Ludwig's
influence to see the truth.

326
00:35:59,264 --> 00:36:01,597
He wanted Caspar under his thumb.

327
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:03,848
Running his errands.

328
00:36:03,933 --> 00:36:06,393
He hated Johanna
because she took him away.

329
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,410
There she is.

330
00:36:22,367 --> 00:36:24,118
Oh, she's so beautiful.

331
00:36:26,577 --> 00:36:31,291
- A marvelous creature.
- She will be mine.

332
00:36:31,334 --> 00:36:34,127
So, you would betray me for that?

333
00:36:34,211 --> 00:36:36,754
Where is your book? Here.

334
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:42,470
Willingly.

335
00:36:42,551 --> 00:36:44,095
She can be bought.

336
00:36:44,138 --> 00:36:46,764
- All women can be bought.
- You are insulting the woman I love.

337
00:36:49,142 --> 00:36:51,602
At first, it will
be all enticements.

338
00:36:51,688 --> 00:36:56,148
Then, snap! The trap shuts.
There's always a price to pay.

339
00:36:56,189 --> 00:36:59,276
I would never betray you
for one of those creatures.

340
00:37:10,452 --> 00:37:12,539
Brothers, I have wonderful news.

341
00:37:13,955 --> 00:37:16,042
She has finally consented.

342
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:18,543
- You are to be wed?
- Yes!

343
00:37:18,627 --> 00:37:19,796
You explain to him.

344
00:37:19,836 --> 00:37:22,506
May I...

345
00:37:22,589 --> 00:37:25,092
present my bride?

346
00:37:25,175 --> 00:37:28,012
Is this a joke?

347
00:37:28,845 --> 00:37:30,805
You cannot be serious.

348
00:37:32,348 --> 00:37:35,101
By all means, copulate with her.

349
00:37:35,182 --> 00:37:38,895
But marriage? What for?

350
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,606
You will be a laughingstock.

351
00:37:40,689 --> 00:37:43,650
Every farmhand in the region
has enjoyed her for free.

352
00:37:43,734 --> 00:37:46,110
Why should you pay more?

353
00:37:55,495 --> 00:37:58,664
I know you cannot hear me,
and I don't care.

354
00:37:58,705 --> 00:38:02,626
What I have to say
is for Caspar, not you.

355
00:38:04,878 --> 00:38:07,507
I have had lovers...

356
00:38:07,549 --> 00:38:09,509
but that is not a crime.

357
00:38:14,556 --> 00:38:16,680
I told you it was impossible.

358
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,654
I only want what is right.

359
00:38:33,238 --> 00:38:37,659
He was jealous of his brother.

360
00:38:37,743 --> 00:38:39,868
Why, she will destroy him.

361
00:38:39,953 --> 00:38:42,663
Jealous of his happiness.

362
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:05,060
I'm Ludwig van Beethoven,
and I need your help.

363
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:25,328
Break the door down.

364
00:40:04,614 --> 00:40:05,864
What are you playing at?

365
00:40:05,949 --> 00:40:07,619
Arrest that whore.

366
00:40:08,744 --> 00:40:11,163
- Don't touch her!
- Arrest that whore.

367
00:40:11,246 --> 00:40:13,581
That is slander.

368
00:40:14,957 --> 00:40:16,752
We were married yesterday.

369
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:26,843
She is with child.

370
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:30,514
Now leave!

371
00:40:31,889 --> 00:40:35,311
He behaved no better
when I married Therese.

372
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:38,352
He wanted us both
at his beck and call.

373
00:40:38,437 --> 00:40:40,856
Give up the search.

374
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:42,857
I cannot.

375
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,859
I have my reasons.

376
00:40:44,941 --> 00:40:47,405
I will find this lady.

377
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:51,908
And she will claim her legacy
with the full force of the law.

378
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,295
"The journey was dreadful.

379
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:09,008
The coach had to go and break
down on such a terrible road.

380
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:12,219
And for no reason,
just a country road.

381
00:41:13,969 --> 00:41:16,683
I have to see you.

382
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:21,269
However much you love me,
I love you more.

383
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:23,478
Never hide yourself from me".

384
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:39,035
Excuse me. I'm looking for
the Countess Erdצdy.

385
00:41:39,078 --> 00:41:40,537
Erdצdy?

386
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:47,249
I'm looking for the Countess Erdצdy.

387
00:41:51,297 --> 00:41:52,256
Zoltan!

388
00:42:04,684 --> 00:42:07,769
Schindler.
You do not recognize me?

389
00:42:07,852 --> 00:42:09,063
Oh.

390
00:42:09,772 --> 00:42:12,232
Please, sit.
Join me for dinner.

391
00:42:18,071 --> 00:42:20,616
- Countess.
- Anna Marie.

392
00:42:20,698 --> 00:42:23,703
These are my people I'm home now.
I don't have to play the countess.

393
00:42:23,786 --> 00:42:25,204
I'm free!

394
00:42:31,624 --> 00:42:35,461
Poor Louis.
I miss him so much.

395
00:42:36,631 --> 00:42:38,590
His death has left a void.

396
00:42:38,674 --> 00:42:40,885
The way they treated him...

397
00:42:42,552 --> 00:42:44,765
disgusted me.

398
00:42:45,805 --> 00:42:48,017
He was too good for them.

399
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:49,766
His fire...

400
00:42:50,852 --> 00:42:52,560
offended their small brains.

401
00:42:53,396 --> 00:42:55,649
But not you.

402
00:42:56,856 --> 00:42:59,151
I could match his temperament.

403
00:43:01,488 --> 00:43:03,490
You gave him rooms at your palace?

404
00:43:04,948 --> 00:43:07,660
I wanted him near me.

405
00:43:08,536 --> 00:43:10,077
Was he your lover?

406
00:44:26,232 --> 00:44:27,650
Horns!

407
00:44:31,861 --> 00:44:33,321
Clarinets!

408
00:45:21,408 --> 00:45:23,327
From the beginning.

409
00:45:55,147 --> 00:45:56,480
From the beginning.

410
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:49,240
That was how I met Louis...

411
00:46:51,324 --> 00:46:54,369
and how the world
learned of his deafness.

412
00:46:59,708 --> 00:47:02,210
I was separated from my husband.

413
00:47:02,292 --> 00:47:07,424
I lived an independent life in Vienna
with my three children.

414
00:47:23,896 --> 00:47:26,356
I will arrange a housekeeper.

415
00:47:44,166 --> 00:47:45,584
Please.

416
00:47:55,092 --> 00:47:57,052
Oh, I had one.

417
00:47:59,346 --> 00:48:01,265
She cheated me.

418
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:14,361
We had thought of Napoleon
as a liberator...

419
00:48:14,443 --> 00:48:17,156
a force for change.

420
00:48:17,237 --> 00:48:20,034
Now we saw the truth.

421
00:48:20,116 --> 00:48:23,536
Bonaparte
had declared himself emperor...

422
00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:26,413
and set out to conquer the world.

423
00:48:26,454 --> 00:48:30,584
He said he brought freedom
from the tyranny of kings.

424
00:48:30,626 --> 00:48:35,255
But he was Saturn,
gobbling up his children.

425
00:48:51,686 --> 00:48:54,189
His cannon fired night and day...

426
00:48:54,272 --> 00:48:56,191
on the city of Vienna.

427
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,521
Leave her alone!

428
00:49:57,122 --> 00:49:58,082
Mimi!

429
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,147
Fire!

430
00:51:02,432 --> 00:51:04,392
Madam.

431
00:51:04,434 --> 00:51:07,271
There is a gentleman
here to see you.

432
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:14,236
I cannot receive anybody.

433
00:51:14,277 --> 00:51:16,487
I think he is deaf.

434
00:51:16,569 --> 00:51:18,864
He will not go away.

435
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:24,120
The countess will see you now.

436
00:51:38,506 --> 00:51:40,259
Your son...

437
00:51:51,393 --> 00:51:53,938
We will speak in music.

438
00:52:15,416 --> 00:52:18,420
Napoleon was victorious.

439
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:22,049
The whole of Europe was at his feet.

440
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:26,593
He took a Hapsburg princess
as his bride...

441
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:29,429
and set up court at Schoenbrun Palace.

442
00:52:31,098 --> 00:52:36,561
He proved himself no different
than any aristocrat.

443
00:52:36,643 --> 00:52:38,562
Everybody was betrayed.

444
00:52:40,814 --> 00:52:43,318
This was the way
of the modern world.

445
00:53:55,426 --> 00:53:58,179
The year Louis lived with us...

446
00:53:58,262 --> 00:54:01,890
was the happiest of my life.

447
00:54:01,974 --> 00:54:03,933
And, I think, of his too.

448
00:54:27,246 --> 00:54:30,250
He opened his heart to me.

449
00:54:30,334 --> 00:54:33,379
He called me
his father confessor.

450
00:54:33,461 --> 00:54:35,380
He told me everything.

451
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:42,553
You must have loved him
very, very much.

452
00:54:42,635 --> 00:54:44,682
With all my heart.

453
00:54:44,763 --> 00:54:46,516
And he you.

454
00:54:58,401 --> 00:54:59,986
I don't think so. No.

455
00:55:00,068 --> 00:55:02,613
Then he was a fool!

456
00:55:05,408 --> 00:55:06,992
I like you better drunk.

457
00:55:08,453 --> 00:55:10,496
- It's good to talk about him.
- Yeah.

458
00:55:11,997 --> 00:55:14,958
But is this why
you came all this way?

459
00:55:14,999 --> 00:55:17,834
No, not only.

460
00:55:17,878 --> 00:55:20,504
You said there was
some unfinished business.

461
00:55:20,587 --> 00:55:22,005
There is.

462
00:55:23,174 --> 00:55:25,885
But how can I help you, Anton?

463
00:55:29,387 --> 00:55:31,931
Perhaps it's nothing.

464
00:55:32,017 --> 00:55:36,436
And perhaps it's the key to him.

465
00:55:38,939 --> 00:55:43,151
Perhaps they're right
and I should let it go, but I cannot.

466
00:55:43,193 --> 00:55:46,905
- It's impossible for me.
- But why?

467
00:55:49,283 --> 00:55:52,450
It was that damned sonata...

468
00:55:54,037 --> 00:55:55,620
the "Kreutzer".

469
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:00,501
At the time I entertained
ambitions of a musical career.

470
00:56:00,541 --> 00:56:03,337
I'd gone to Vienna to study
and was fortunate enough...

471
00:56:03,379 --> 00:56:05,880
to be taken by Schuppanzigh
as a pupil.

472
00:56:05,921 --> 00:56:09,135
He and George Bridgetower,
the famous virtuoso from Africa...

473
00:56:09,216 --> 00:56:12,178
were about to premiere
this new Beethoven sonata...

474
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:15,098
at Count Razumovsky's that evening...

475
00:56:15,182 --> 00:56:18,100
and I was allowed
to attend the rehearsal.

476
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:24,107
It was there that the seed
of a mystery was planted...

477
00:56:24,189 --> 00:56:27,066
that haunts me to this day.

478
00:56:37,076 --> 00:56:38,411
Do you like it?

479
00:56:39,495 --> 00:56:42,415
I cannot hear them.

480
00:56:42,456 --> 00:56:44,750
But I know they are
making a hash of it.

481
00:56:44,832 --> 00:56:46,753
What do you think?

482
00:56:50,212 --> 00:56:54,299
Music is a dreadful thing.

483
00:56:55,759 --> 00:56:57,888
What is it?

484
00:56:57,970 --> 00:56:59,473
I don't understand it.

485
00:56:59,555 --> 00:57:02,850
What does it do?

486
00:57:04,476 --> 00:57:07,646
It exalts the soul.

487
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:10,733
Utter nonsense If you hear
a marching band, is your soul exalted?

488
00:57:10,774 --> 00:57:14,028
No, you march.
If you hear a waltz, you dance.

489
00:57:14,111 --> 00:57:16,238
If you hear a mass,
you take communion.

490
00:57:17,405 --> 00:57:20,783
It is the power of music...

491
00:57:20,824 --> 00:57:24,412
to carry one directly
into the mental state...

492
00:57:24,494 --> 00:57:26,288
of the composer.

493
00:57:26,998 --> 00:57:29,710
The listener has no choice.

494
00:57:29,792 --> 00:57:31,708
It is like hypnotism.

495
00:57:33,503 --> 00:57:36,256
So, now...

496
00:57:36,296 --> 00:57:38,923
what was in my mind
when I wrote this?

497
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:47,850
A man is trying
to reach his lover.

498
00:57:47,933 --> 00:57:50,560
His carriage has broken down
in the rain.

499
00:57:50,644 --> 00:57:53,482
The wheels stuck in the mud.

500
00:57:55,065 --> 00:57:56,983
She will only wait so long.

501
00:57:59,277 --> 00:58:01,779
This...

502
00:58:01,863 --> 00:58:05,033
is the sound of his agitation.

503
00:58:13,539 --> 00:58:16,335
"This is how it is..."

504
00:58:17,252 --> 00:58:19,837
the music is saying.

505
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:24,091
"Not how you are used to being.

506
00:58:24,176 --> 00:58:27,136
Not how you are used to thinking.

507
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:30,641
But like this".

508
00:58:33,353 --> 00:58:37,188
Who was the woman?
He never told me.

509
00:58:37,273 --> 00:58:39,356
I knew better than to ask.

510
00:58:42,651 --> 00:58:46,072
He made me see the world
in an entirely new light.

511
00:58:47,904 --> 00:58:52,827
I abandoned my petty ambitions.
I fetched and carried for him.

512
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:56,373
I wrote his letters and smoothed over
his domestic disputes.

513
00:58:58,248 --> 00:59:00,625
I became his secretary.

514
00:59:05,879 --> 00:59:10,551
Oh, the hag has sold it in the market
for a souvenir.

515
00:59:10,633 --> 00:59:12,345
Oh, no.

516
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:14,514
It's lost.

517
00:59:15,557 --> 00:59:17,684
Gone forever.

518
00:59:17,766 --> 00:59:19,226
Here.

519
00:59:24,065 --> 00:59:25,525
Maybe not.

520
00:59:27,191 --> 00:59:30,278
Ludwig was convinced he had left
the sketch for his new symphony...

521
00:59:30,361 --> 00:59:32,905
in the safekeeping
of his brother Caspar.

522
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:35,034
- My God. Here.
- Uncle!

523
00:59:35,115 --> 00:59:37,618
The brothers had barely spoken
for eight years.

524
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,286
This is Herr Schindler.

525
00:59:39,369 --> 00:59:42,374
This is my brother Caspar...

526
00:59:43,249 --> 00:59:47,126
and my nephew, young Karl.

527
00:59:47,211 --> 00:59:50,379
Had I realized this,
I would have stopped him.

528
00:59:52,757 --> 00:59:54,718
It is good to see you.

529
01:00:04,265 --> 01:00:07,771
I need the papers
I entrusted to you.

530
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,573
They were all returned to you.

531
01:00:35,588 --> 01:00:39,842
I said, your papers
are not here.

532
01:00:51,479 --> 01:00:54,063
You.
Where are my notes?

533
01:00:54,148 --> 01:00:57,108
I would rather he not cause a scene
in front of the boy.

534
01:00:57,191 --> 01:01:00,194
- What did the whore say?
- Get out of my house!

535
01:01:00,278 --> 01:01:02,530
You've thrown away my music.

536
01:01:02,615 --> 01:01:06,117
You and this foul slut
you call a wife.

537
01:01:16,836 --> 01:01:18,753
- You have betrayed me!
- Maestro!

538
01:01:18,839 --> 01:01:20,588
Maestro, please!

539
01:01:20,673 --> 01:01:22,007
Stop it!

540
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:25,009
He's sick!

541
01:01:29,345 --> 01:01:32,391
Leave!
Never return to this house!

542
01:01:34,184 --> 01:01:36,145
He has consumption.

543
01:01:53,953 --> 01:01:56,621
Caspar died
before the year was out...

544
01:01:56,706 --> 01:01:59,499
but there was no relief
in his death.

545
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:02,126
Rather, it sent Ludwig
on a path of action...

546
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:04,129
that would lead to his destruction.

547
01:02:05,213 --> 01:02:07,255
That man.

548
01:02:07,341 --> 01:02:09,508
He rooms with her.

549
01:02:10,303 --> 01:02:14,223
My brother's bed is not yet cold...

550
01:02:15,055 --> 01:02:17,017
and he is climbing in.

551
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:31,613
If he says nasty things about me,
don't listen. None of it is true.

552
01:02:31,697 --> 01:02:34,366
- Promise?
- I promise.

553
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:37,452
I will come and see you
every day.

554
01:02:38,244 --> 01:02:39,663
Come in.

555
01:02:42,247 --> 01:02:43,666
Is this the lad?

556
01:02:47,545 --> 01:02:48,962
Yes.

557
01:02:50,924 --> 01:02:52,840
"By order of the Landrechte...

558
01:02:52,924 --> 01:02:57,638
Ludwig van Beethoven has been appointed
the legal guardian of his nephew Karl...

559
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:02,808
owing to the low moral character
of his mother, Johanna van Beethoven.

560
01:03:02,892 --> 01:03:06,311
Rights of visitation for the mother will
be at the discretion and convenience...

561
01:03:06,396 --> 01:03:08,313
of the legal guardian".

562
01:03:47,892 --> 01:03:49,435
Too watery.

563
01:03:52,147 --> 01:03:53,563
Write.

564
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:10,914
Then we shall have to find
someone who can cook.

565
01:04:15,834 --> 01:04:18,463
She has a swinish face anyway.

566
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:25,510
- Were you taught music?
- Yes.

567
01:04:27,762 --> 01:04:29,680
I have a gift for you.

568
01:04:37,187 --> 01:04:38,606
Come.

569
01:04:47,531 --> 01:04:49,948
- Can you read?
- Yes.

570
01:05:13,011 --> 01:05:15,098
Here.

571
01:05:15,181 --> 01:05:17,101
Let me show you.

572
01:05:30,528 --> 01:05:32,448
You shall be a musician.

573
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:35,866
I want to be a soldier.

574
01:05:35,908 --> 01:05:37,534
A composer?

575
01:05:37,578 --> 01:05:39,537
No. A soldier.

576
01:05:41,373 --> 01:05:42,790
Oh.

577
01:05:47,294 --> 01:05:50,255
I gave my first concert
when I was your age.

578
01:05:52,174 --> 01:05:53,718
I was terrible.

579
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:59,598
Your grandfather thought that he was
going to make a fortune out of me...

580
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,599
as a child prodigy.

581
01:06:02,933 --> 01:06:04,852
Like Mozart's old man.

582
01:06:12,192 --> 01:06:14,403
But I was pigheaded.

583
01:06:14,488 --> 01:06:19,741
I wouldn't play that tinkly,
pretty stuff that was in vogue then.

584
01:06:19,824 --> 01:06:22,410
But the keyboards of the day
were not up to it.

585
01:06:22,493 --> 01:06:25,996
The first time I played at court,
I broke four strings.

586
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:27,999
Herr Beethoven!

587
01:06:29,124 --> 01:06:31,543
The boy is hardly a Mozart,
is he?

588
01:06:34,378 --> 01:06:36,298
I was 12...

589
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:38,799
but Father told them I was nine.

590
01:07:30,849 --> 01:07:33,685
Mother died of consumption...

591
01:07:33,726 --> 01:07:36,980
and I became
the head of the family.

592
01:07:41,442 --> 01:07:42,735
Your papa...

593
01:07:43,986 --> 01:07:45,904
I loved most of all.

594
01:07:49,032 --> 01:07:50,785
As I love you...

595
01:07:51,866 --> 01:07:53,620
my dear Karl.

596
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,893
His eyes shone with joy...

597
01:08:19,976 --> 01:08:22,229
when he looked at the boy.

598
01:08:22,311 --> 01:08:25,817
All the love in his rich and deep nature
seemed to concentrate...

599
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:28,236
on this boy.

600
01:08:28,318 --> 01:08:31,446
There was no more tender father.

601
01:08:45,084 --> 01:08:47,001
You should hear him play.

602
01:08:48,587 --> 01:08:50,922
He is going to be a great virtuoso.

603
01:08:57,344 --> 01:08:58,763
You spoil him.

604
01:09:05,436 --> 01:09:08,064
Schindler tells me
you've written nothing.

605
01:09:08,106 --> 01:09:10,065
Well, I have no time.

606
01:09:11,608 --> 01:09:13,360
And besides...

607
01:09:14,196 --> 01:09:17,490
all the servants that Schindler sends me
are scoundrels.

608
01:09:17,573 --> 01:09:18,991
You are impossible.

609
01:09:20,867 --> 01:09:22,911
Perhaps.

610
01:09:24,412 --> 01:09:25,913
You and I...

611
01:09:29,206 --> 01:09:30,794
Could Karl...

612
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:35,881
not replace
the son that you lost?

613
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:56,317
I know what it is to lose a son.

614
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:09,077
I know the sorrow Johanna feels.

615
01:10:10,287 --> 01:10:13,709
- She has no right to him!
- She's his mother!

616
01:10:14,876 --> 01:10:16,836
She's his mother!

617
01:10:22,173 --> 01:10:24,219
What new insanity is this?

618
01:10:24,301 --> 01:10:27,931
It has come to our attention
that you have been bribing servants...

619
01:10:28,013 --> 01:10:30,807
in order to have access to the boy
in secret...

620
01:10:30,848 --> 01:10:33,685
while you well know that Herr Beethoven
would not allow...

621
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:36,060
You are talking about my son.

622
01:10:36,144 --> 01:10:41,067
My son, who I have not seen for a year,
who is being taught to hate me.

623
01:10:41,149 --> 01:10:43,236
The decree of the court states...

624
01:10:43,319 --> 01:10:45,320
I know what it says.

625
01:10:47,865 --> 01:10:52,702
Can you look me in the eye and tell me
a mother has no right to see her son?

626
01:10:55,455 --> 01:10:57,248
I will fight this.

627
01:10:57,332 --> 01:10:59,500
You will lose.

628
01:10:59,542 --> 01:11:01,500
He has many enemies.

629
01:11:04,045 --> 01:11:06,675
The filth was bad enough.

630
01:11:06,757 --> 01:11:08,715
That man is mad.

631
01:11:08,759 --> 01:11:12,885
He cannot hear a thing.
He's always shouting and yelling.

632
01:11:12,971 --> 01:11:16,516
The landlord would chuck him out
from his carrying on.

633
01:11:16,599 --> 01:11:20,603
The boy is just as bad.
His uncle encouraged him.

634
01:11:20,685 --> 01:11:25,024
I overheard them discussing how
they was going to beat me, so I left.

635
01:11:25,065 --> 01:11:27,569
Was the boy kept clean?

636
01:11:27,652 --> 01:11:31,697
He'd go a month
without fresh underwear.

637
01:11:31,737 --> 01:11:35,326
That man cannot look after himself,
let alone a child.

638
01:11:35,408 --> 01:11:38,579
I would now like to call
Karl van Beethoven.

639
01:11:52,258 --> 01:11:54,216
Good afternoon, Karl.

640
01:11:54,261 --> 01:11:55,636
Good afternoon.

641
01:11:55,718 --> 01:11:57,637
How does your uncle treat you?

642
01:11:58,346 --> 01:11:59,431
Well.

643
01:11:59,513 --> 01:12:01,515
He has a hot temper?

644
01:12:01,599 --> 01:12:02,683
Yes.

645
01:12:02,769 --> 01:12:05,268
- Do you fear his temper?
- No.

646
01:12:06,185 --> 01:12:09,983
- Did he ever punish you?
- Only when I deserved it.

647
01:12:11,066 --> 01:12:13,610
Who would you prefer to live with?

648
01:12:14,445 --> 01:12:17,198
Your uncle or your mother?

649
01:12:18,281 --> 01:12:20,534
Do you want to stay
with your uncle?

650
01:12:21,618 --> 01:12:22,743
Yes.

651
01:12:22,785 --> 01:12:24,120
Speak up.

652
01:12:24,204 --> 01:12:27,206
- Yes.
- You don't sound certain.

653
01:12:27,291 --> 01:12:31,212
It would be better
if Uncle had someone to be with him...

654
01:12:31,293 --> 01:12:35,297
because he is hard of hearing
and can't talk to me.

655
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:38,299
In fact, he is stone deaf.

656
01:12:43,473 --> 01:12:45,182
Do you love your mother?

657
01:12:50,353 --> 01:12:52,438
Yes.

658
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,356
Do you miss her?

659
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:56,109
Yes.

660
01:12:56,150 --> 01:12:59,570
Then would you not prefer
to live with her?

661
01:13:05,284 --> 01:13:07,202
Uncle needs me.

662
01:13:11,165 --> 01:13:15,793
What I would prefer...

663
01:13:15,835 --> 01:13:19,172
is that we might all live together.

664
01:13:21,256 --> 01:13:23,176
This way, gentlemen, please.

665
01:13:29,722 --> 01:13:33,809
Herr Beethoven,
our most accomplished composer.

666
01:13:35,019 --> 01:13:37,104
It is an honor.

667
01:13:39,648 --> 01:13:42,319
Chancellor Metternich...

668
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,904
due to his infirmity, Herr Beethoven
has requested that I speak for him.

669
01:13:45,988 --> 01:13:48,364
As you wish.

670
01:13:48,449 --> 01:13:51,369
His case in the magistracies
is not going well.

671
01:13:51,451 --> 01:13:54,871
That is, Frau Beethoven
has bribed witnesses...

672
01:13:54,954 --> 01:13:57,291
Sir, I need your help.

673
01:13:57,373 --> 01:14:00,586
My young nephew, Karl...

674
01:14:00,668 --> 01:14:04,547
he is being corrupted
by this woman's poisonous carryings on.

675
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:09,342
- What Herr Beethoven means...
- Why should I help you, Beethoven?

676
01:14:30,110 --> 01:14:34,783
"Metternich is a worse tyrant
than Napoleon".

677
01:14:34,866 --> 01:14:38,578
That was recorded last Tuesday
at the Swan Tavern.

678
01:14:41,664 --> 01:14:45,126
"Metternich should be forced
to eat my shit".

679
01:14:46,378 --> 01:14:48,964
And so on, and so forth.

680
01:14:50,045 --> 01:14:53,176
Herr Beethoven,
there are many forces in Austria...

681
01:14:53,258 --> 01:14:55,302
that foment revolt.

682
01:14:55,386 --> 01:14:58,304
I like a lively discussion
as much as the next man...

683
01:14:58,388 --> 01:15:02,434
but I fear that these days
we cannot allow quite so much...

684
01:15:02,516 --> 01:15:04,768
How can I put it?

685
01:15:04,852 --> 01:15:06,314
Enthusiasm.

686
01:15:07,189 --> 01:15:10,192
Perhaps it would be better
if our great artists...

687
01:15:10,274 --> 01:15:12,193
were a little more circumspect.

688
01:15:12,276 --> 01:15:15,029
Herr Beethoven proposes
that he write a grand oratorio...

689
01:15:15,113 --> 01:15:18,449
praising Austria
and your magnificent diplomacy...

690
01:15:18,532 --> 01:15:20,575
at the Congress of Vienna...

691
01:15:20,617 --> 01:15:23,578
that has secured the peace
for all of Europe.

692
01:15:27,414 --> 01:15:29,542
This court...

693
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:33,838
has seen fit to ordain...

694
01:15:33,922 --> 01:15:38,009
that Johanna van Beethoven...

695
01:15:38,091 --> 01:15:41,345
shall be excluded from...

696
01:15:42,513 --> 01:15:44,973
This court is corrupt!

697
01:15:52,647 --> 01:15:56,400
Now that the boy was delivered
to Ludwig, body and soul...

698
01:15:56,484 --> 01:16:01,990
the deaf genius began in earnest what
was to be his most tragic endeavor...

699
01:16:02,072 --> 01:16:04,992
to make his ward a great virtuoso.

700
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:09,748
For five long years
this was his goal...

701
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:12,834
and in those five years
Ludwig wrote nothing.

702
01:16:12,916 --> 01:16:14,835
Not the oratorio
he promised Metternich.

703
01:16:14,919 --> 01:16:17,837
Not the mass he promised
the London Philharmonic Society.

704
01:16:17,921 --> 01:16:20,840
Not the great symphony
he spoke of endlessly.

705
01:16:22,091 --> 01:16:23,509
Nothing.

706
01:16:27,553 --> 01:16:31,057
In Vienna they thought he was finished...
deaf, written-out.

707
01:16:32,143 --> 01:16:34,061
Rossini had performed
The Thieving Magpie..

708
01:16:34,143 --> 01:16:36,814
and Italian opera was all the rage.

709
01:16:36,852 --> 01:16:39,815
Beethoven was no longer performed.

710
01:16:45,444 --> 01:16:46,863
Karl!

711
01:17:07,633 --> 01:17:08,718
It's late.

712
01:17:10,221 --> 01:17:11,470
I'm sorry, sir.

713
01:17:19,808 --> 01:17:21,938
It's disgusting.

714
01:17:22,022 --> 01:17:26,566
Why does she disobey me? She knows
my bowel is in a terrible state.

715
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:37,244
You're trying to poison me!

716
01:17:48,002 --> 01:17:52,758
Well, she might appear
plump and pretty to you...

717
01:17:52,841 --> 01:17:55,386
but she's a vulgar bitch.

718
01:17:55,469 --> 01:17:59,472
Gossips about me all over town.

719
01:18:02,558 --> 01:18:03,851
Frהulein!

720
01:18:06,105 --> 01:18:07,440
Yes, sir?

721
01:18:07,523 --> 01:18:10,192
Your food is poison.
You're fired.

722
01:18:17,449 --> 01:18:19,199
You foul old bastard.

723
01:18:19,283 --> 01:18:21,201
Write.

724
01:18:26,706 --> 01:18:28,293
Where are you going?

725
01:18:29,918 --> 01:18:31,419
Away from you.

726
01:18:34,629 --> 01:18:36,591
Well, leave me, then.

727
01:18:37,967 --> 01:18:39,886
You're evil.

728
01:18:39,969 --> 01:18:41,886
Like your mother.

729
01:18:43,764 --> 01:18:47,059
Leave me alone with no food.

730
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:08,077
Have you seen Karl?

731
01:20:08,675 --> 01:20:10,595
You're worthless!

732
01:20:11,889 --> 01:20:13,512
Worthless!

733
01:20:47,420 --> 01:20:49,508
I'm sending for the doctor now.

734
01:20:56,053 --> 01:20:57,471
Tomorrow.

735
01:21:02,558 --> 01:21:04,143
Play for me.

736
01:21:05,437 --> 01:21:06,854
Not now.

737
01:21:08,064 --> 01:21:09,941
It will calm me.

738
01:21:11,609 --> 01:21:13,068
Play.

739
01:22:27,346 --> 01:22:29,765
I found this the other day.

740
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:32,767
"The Maestro,
Ludwig van Beethoven...

741
01:22:32,853 --> 01:22:34,769
has the pleasure
to announce a concert...

742
01:22:34,853 --> 01:22:39,691
which will be the debut of his nephew
and ward, Karl van Beethoven...

743
01:22:39,775 --> 01:22:42,192
a prodigy instructed
by the Maestro himself".

744
01:22:42,276 --> 01:22:46,490
Why, this is wonderful. The very thing
that will raise his spirits.

745
01:22:46,531 --> 01:22:48,532
You must be very excited.

746
01:22:48,615 --> 01:22:50,825
Anton, have you ever heard me play?

747
01:22:50,868 --> 01:22:53,621
- No, but...
- You have to help me.

748
01:22:53,705 --> 01:22:56,122
I'm at the end of my tether.

749
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:01,337
Endless hours at the keyboard.

750
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:05,381
For what?

751
01:23:05,466 --> 01:23:08,383
He cannot hear
my ham-fisted playing.

752
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,391
He does no work.

753
01:23:17,725 --> 01:23:21,355
All he does is
scribble incomprehensible phrases.

754
01:23:23,064 --> 01:23:27,986
Then he bellows this stupid,
childish tune at the top of his lungs.

755
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:38,828
He says this is the motif
of a grand symphony.

756
01:23:40,661 --> 01:23:42,249
I think it's ridiculous.

757
01:23:43,666 --> 01:23:46,586
- That cannot be.
- But it is.

758
01:23:47,921 --> 01:23:50,339
I think he's going mad.

759
01:23:54,386 --> 01:23:56,388
So...

760
01:23:57,595 --> 01:24:00,516
I am to abandon my plans, eh?

761
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:03,767
I am placing...

762
01:24:03,852 --> 01:24:06,771
intolerable pressure..

763
01:24:06,813 --> 01:24:08,814
on Karl, eh?

764
01:24:12,902 --> 01:24:14,529
He is a...

765
01:24:15,528 --> 01:24:17,450
a mediocre talent.

766
01:24:26,122 --> 01:24:30,251
There are always these...

767
01:24:30,335 --> 01:24:33,004
asinine fellows like Schindler...

768
01:24:33,088 --> 01:24:35,132
with their...

769
01:24:35,215 --> 01:24:37,633
commonplace opinions...

770
01:24:37,718 --> 01:24:40,218
from their commonplace minds.

771
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:43,138
Schindler is right.

772
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:44,640
Oh.

773
01:24:46,641 --> 01:24:48,603
Anton Schindler...

774
01:24:48,644 --> 01:24:50,102
bad violinist...

775
01:24:50,144 --> 01:24:53,648
knows more about music
than Ludwig van Beethoven.

776
01:24:54,648 --> 01:24:56,567
This is too much.

777
01:24:58,653 --> 01:25:00,279
You're torturing the boy.

778
01:25:10,621 --> 01:25:14,042
I always thought
that you were a bore...

779
01:25:15,628 --> 01:25:17,878
and an ass...

780
01:25:17,962 --> 01:25:21,507
but you've had your uses,
and now you have none.

781
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:22,718
Get out.

782
01:25:31,726 --> 01:25:35,230
Get out.

783
01:26:36,076 --> 01:26:38,370
Wake up, bastard!

784
01:26:38,411 --> 01:26:39,872
Schindler!

785
01:26:41,625 --> 01:26:43,248
Wake up!

786
01:26:44,334 --> 01:26:45,753
Karl.

787
01:26:46,796 --> 01:26:48,253
He's gone...

788
01:26:49,298 --> 01:26:50,507
on your account.

789
01:28:44,904 --> 01:28:47,073
My Karl has shot himself.

790
01:28:47,157 --> 01:28:50,951
A farmer found him in the ruins.
He carried him here on his cart.

791
01:28:51,035 --> 01:28:52,453
I fear the worst.

792
01:28:54,205 --> 01:28:55,622
Uncle.

793
01:28:56,790 --> 01:28:58,417
I was expecting you.

794
01:29:46,587 --> 01:29:49,841
Karl was a bungler with firearms.

795
01:29:49,922 --> 01:29:53,050
The bullet
did not penetrate his skull.

796
01:29:53,135 --> 01:29:55,762
He did not die.

797
01:29:55,844 --> 01:29:59,431
But the legend grew in Vienna
of Ludwig's cruelty to the boy...

798
01:30:00,684 --> 01:30:03,437
of how he drove him to a desperate act.

799
01:30:04,685 --> 01:30:08,023
Those who had
silently disliked him...

800
01:30:08,107 --> 01:30:10,024
now shouted their derision...

801
01:30:11,109 --> 01:30:13,026
from the rooftops.

802
01:30:53,647 --> 01:30:55,192
There is a letter.

803
01:31:00,321 --> 01:31:02,405
I must find this lady.

804
01:31:04,074 --> 01:31:07,495
He bequeathed
his entire estate to her.

805
01:31:21,549 --> 01:31:23,802
It was not written to me.

806
01:31:27,136 --> 01:31:28,808
Then who?

807
01:31:36,521 --> 01:31:39,608
It was she who came between us.

808
01:31:41,484 --> 01:31:43,487
I loved him completely...

809
01:31:43,527 --> 01:31:47,115
but he could never
return that sentiment.

810
01:31:47,199 --> 01:31:49,116
He could not forget her.

811
01:31:50,244 --> 01:31:51,496
Who is she?

812
01:31:56,873 --> 01:31:58,626
I failed him.

813
01:31:58,710 --> 01:32:01,129
We all failed him.

814
01:32:01,211 --> 01:32:03,172
He gave us so much.

815
01:32:03,213 --> 01:32:06,174
We couldn't even
make his life tolerable.

816
01:32:06,215 --> 01:32:08,842
This last wish
must be as he wanted.

817
01:32:08,885 --> 01:32:11,262
Tell me.

818
01:32:11,346 --> 01:32:13,347
Tell me her name.

819
01:32:16,434 --> 01:32:19,104
The answer was always
in front of you.

820
01:32:26,359 --> 01:32:28,321
"While still in my bed...

821
01:32:28,405 --> 01:32:30,530
my thoughts turn to you...

822
01:32:30,612 --> 01:32:32,574
my immortal beloved.

823
01:32:32,615 --> 01:32:33,866
What will you do?

824
01:32:33,907 --> 01:32:35,703
Some happy, some sad...

825
01:32:35,785 --> 01:32:37,744
I don't know.

826
01:32:37,829 --> 01:32:41,499
waiting to see
whether fate will hear us.

827
01:32:42,791 --> 01:32:44,251
I don't know.

828
01:32:50,215 --> 01:32:54,968
I can live only completely
with you or not at all.

829
01:32:55,052 --> 01:32:57,555
Yes. It must be".

830
01:32:58,763 --> 01:33:00,184
Go to her.

831
01:33:01,933 --> 01:33:03,352
It must be.

832
01:33:42,722 --> 01:33:44,641
May we speak in private?

833
01:33:45,974 --> 01:33:49,021
I have nothing to hide
from my workers.

834
01:33:49,812 --> 01:33:51,397
I implore you.

835
01:33:56,652 --> 01:33:59,113
As you can see,
I am very busy.

836
01:34:03,157 --> 01:34:05,117
Frau Beethoven...

837
01:34:06,534 --> 01:34:09,663
may I see a sample
of your handwriting?

838
01:34:10,747 --> 01:34:12,832
- Why?
- Please.

839
01:34:14,376 --> 01:34:15,836
Indulge me.

840
01:34:24,510 --> 01:34:25,845
Here.

841
01:34:35,062 --> 01:34:37,149
Is this your handwriting?

842
01:34:38,108 --> 01:34:39,232
What is this?

843
01:34:40,025 --> 01:34:43,903
A page from the registry
of a hotel in Karlsbad.

844
01:34:45,820 --> 01:34:47,073
I would like you to go.

845
01:34:47,158 --> 01:34:48,573
Signed...

846
01:34:51,077 --> 01:34:52,329
by you.

847
01:34:53,454 --> 01:34:56,875
Did you ever meet Ludwig
in Karlsbad?

848
01:34:58,709 --> 01:35:02,419
You can hardly be unaware of the manner
in which I suffered at his hands.

849
01:35:02,504 --> 01:35:05,422
I find the question
as insulting as it is impudent.

850
01:35:05,507 --> 01:35:07,092
What are you implying?

851
01:35:07,175 --> 01:35:10,845
There can be no peace
without the truth.

852
01:35:14,850 --> 01:35:16,767
For you, maybe.

853
01:35:17,892 --> 01:35:20,353
But I have made my peace
with Ludwig.

854
01:35:41,914 --> 01:35:44,875
I forgave him
because of the "Ode to Joy".

855
01:35:47,754 --> 01:35:50,714
When they announced the premiere
of the Ninth Symphony...

856
01:35:50,758 --> 01:35:52,925
the gossip was everywhere.

857
01:35:53,010 --> 01:35:55,176
Ludwig had fought with the singers.

858
01:35:55,261 --> 01:35:57,178
He had fought the theater.

859
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:04,854
Even though
I had hated him for so long...

860
01:36:04,936 --> 01:36:08,022
even though
he had tried to destroy me...

861
01:36:08,105 --> 01:36:10,486
I went.

862
01:36:10,569 --> 01:36:11,987
I had to go.

863
01:36:13,068 --> 01:36:15,488
I knew it would be the last time.

864
01:37:08,454 --> 01:37:10,246
I could not see him...

865
01:37:10,330 --> 01:37:13,167
and I imagined
some last-minute insult...

866
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:15,168
had sent him running home.

867
01:37:34,186 --> 01:37:35,857
Then I saw him.

868
01:37:35,938 --> 01:37:37,857
Everybody saw him.

869
01:43:02,866 --> 01:43:04,533
Bravo!

870
01:43:39,983 --> 01:43:44,071
He had revealed
his most hidden secrets to us.

871
01:43:44,155 --> 01:43:46,531
The circle was broken.

872
01:43:46,615 --> 01:43:50,035
I could not hate the man
who could write such music.

873
01:43:52,702 --> 01:43:54,621
I saw him one more time...

874
01:43:54,705 --> 01:43:57,833
at his rooms
on Schwarzspanier Strasse.

875
01:43:57,915 --> 01:43:59,877
That was where he died.

876
01:44:01,587 --> 01:44:03,548
His belly swelled so much...

877
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:06,969
that the surgeon had to make a puncture
to drain off the fluid.

878
01:44:08,095 --> 01:44:10,679
The incision became inflamed.

879
01:44:10,721 --> 01:44:14,849
His strength has gone,
and I fear the death struggle has begun.

880
01:44:16,392 --> 01:44:20,353
I want him to receive the last rites
while he is still conscious.

881
01:44:20,395 --> 01:44:24,232
But when I suggested
I send for a priest...

882
01:44:24,316 --> 01:44:27,527
he turned his face to the wall
and called me an ass.

883
01:44:27,609 --> 01:44:30,864
Then he asked for you.
I don't know why.

884
01:44:30,949 --> 01:44:32,490
Is he sleeping?

885
01:44:32,574 --> 01:44:34,157
I don't think so.

886
01:44:36,202 --> 01:44:37,786
He is composing.

887
01:47:48,046 --> 01:47:50,383
The comedy is over.

888
01:48:24,914 --> 01:48:26,332
Yes.

889
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:30,127
I once loved him.

890
01:48:35,466 --> 01:48:37,969
But he turned his back on me.

891
01:48:38,054 --> 01:48:39,970
He abandoned me.

892
01:48:41,014 --> 01:48:43,265
I never heard a word from him.

893
01:48:45,684 --> 01:48:48,269
I was a fool.

894
01:48:48,353 --> 01:48:50,689
I never meant anything to him.

895
01:48:52,149 --> 01:48:53,609
But the letter...

896
01:48:54,609 --> 01:48:55,735
What letter?

897
01:49:18,465 --> 01:49:20,465
Frau Beethoven, I believe...

898
01:49:21,716 --> 01:49:23,678
this is addressed to you.

899
01:50:45,919 --> 01:50:48,171
"My angel...

900
01:50:48,255 --> 01:50:50,632
my all...

901
01:50:50,716 --> 01:50:53,303
my other self.

902
01:50:53,386 --> 01:50:57,389
Just a few words today,
and that in pencil...

903
01:50:57,471 --> 01:50:58,932
yours.

904
01:51:05,856 --> 01:51:09,776
Only tomorrow will I know for certain
where I am to stay.

905
01:51:09,858 --> 01:51:13,570
A worthless waste
of time and such.

906
01:51:13,654 --> 01:51:16,407
Why this deep sorrow?

907
01:51:16,490 --> 01:51:20,953
If we could be united,
we would feel this pain no longer.

908
01:51:22,203 --> 01:51:23,915
Where I am...

909
01:51:23,997 --> 01:51:26,374
you are with me too.

910
01:51:26,459 --> 01:51:30,838
Soon we shall live together,
and what a life it will be".

911
01:51:54,317 --> 01:51:56,236
- We must talk.
- Not here.

912
01:51:59,906 --> 01:52:02,158
Caspar will come.

913
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:03,659
We must speak.

914
01:52:06,036 --> 01:52:07,995
I'm talking too loudly.

915
01:52:12,836 --> 01:52:15,628
Meet me in Karlsbad.

916
01:52:15,710 --> 01:52:17,921
This is the address.

917
01:52:18,005 --> 01:52:21,674
I can no longer skulk around
like a guilty schoolboy.

918
01:52:33,978 --> 01:52:36,440
I have your child in me.

919
01:52:40,985 --> 01:52:42,403
Go.

920
01:53:05,634 --> 01:53:07,843
"The journey was dreadful.

921
01:53:07,885 --> 01:53:11,638
I did not arrive here
until 4:00 in the morning.

922
01:53:11,722 --> 01:53:14,642
At the last stop they warned me
against traveling at night...

923
01:53:14,725 --> 01:53:17,351
and tried to frighten me
about a forest...

924
01:53:17,393 --> 01:53:20,563
but that only tempted me.

925
01:53:20,646 --> 01:53:25,027
The coach had to go and break down
on such a terrible road for no reason.

926
01:53:25,067 --> 01:53:26,737
Just a country road...

927
01:53:26,819 --> 01:53:30,448
and now I am held up completely.

928
01:53:30,530 --> 01:53:32,783
But I have found another...

929
01:53:32,868 --> 01:53:36,328
and we will surely
see one another soon.

930
01:53:36,412 --> 01:53:38,329
Today, I hope.

931
01:53:40,624 --> 01:53:43,501
I have to see you.

932
01:53:43,585 --> 01:53:45,503
However much you love me...

933
01:53:46,629 --> 01:53:49,213
I love you more.

934
01:53:49,299 --> 01:53:51,758
Never hide yourself from me".

935
01:55:08,415 --> 01:55:10,500
Herr van Beethoven!

936
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,459
Wait!

937
01:55:47,660 --> 01:55:49,618
"While still in my bed...

938
01:55:49,702 --> 01:55:52,827
my thoughts turn to you...

939
01:55:52,872 --> 01:55:54,831
my immortal beloved.

940
01:55:55,707 --> 01:55:58,877
Some of them happy, some sad...

941
01:56:00,042 --> 01:56:03,005
waiting to see
whether fate will hear us.

942
01:56:06,049 --> 01:56:10,846
I can live only completely
with you or not at all.

943
01:56:10,930 --> 01:56:13,390
Yes. It must be.

944
01:56:15,850 --> 01:56:18,187
I must go to sleep now.

945
01:56:18,228 --> 01:56:20,772
Be calm, love.

946
01:56:20,856 --> 01:56:23,440
Today, yesterday...

947
01:56:23,524 --> 01:56:25,736
what longing with tears for you.

948
01:56:26,819 --> 01:56:29,032
You.

949
01:56:29,072 --> 01:56:31,616
You're my life.

950
01:56:31,698 --> 01:56:33,619
My everything.

951
01:56:35,119 --> 01:56:36,787
Farewell, then.

952
01:56:36,870 --> 01:56:38,373
Go on loving me.

953
01:56:38,456 --> 01:56:41,916
Ever yours, ever mine...

954
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,002
forever".

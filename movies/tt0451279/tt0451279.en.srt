DIANA: I used to
want to save the world.

3
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:53,621
This beautiful place.

4
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:57,525
But I knew so little then.

5
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:02,663
It is a land
of magic and wonder.

6
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,666
Worth cherishing in every way.

7
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:10,938
But the closer you get,

8
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:14,942
the more you see the great
darkness simmering within.

9
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:22,215
And mankind? (CHUCKLES)

10
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,085
Mankind is
another story altogether.

11
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:30,090
What one does
when faced with the truth

12
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:32,593
is more difficult
than you think.

13
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,605
I learned this the hard way.

14
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,708
A long, long time ago.

15
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,612
And now,

16
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,949
I will never be the same.

17
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,725
Merci.

How are you today?

HIPPOLYTA: Let's get you
back to school

41
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,114
before another tutor quits.

42
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:42,821
YOUNG DIANA:
But don't you think it's time

43
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:45,418
to start my training?

44
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,220
Antiope thinks I'm ready.

45
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,890
HIPPOLYTA: Does she?

46
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,793
I could begin
showing her some things.

47
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,629
She should at least
be able to defend herself.

48
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:57,765
From whom?

49
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,833
In the event of an invasion.

50
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,234
HIPPOLYTA:
Isn't that why I have

51
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,303
the greatest warrior
in our history

52
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,673
leading an entire army,
General?

53
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,910
I pray a day will never come
where she has to fight.

54
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:13,446
But you know,
a scorpion must sting,

55
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,647
a wolf must hunt...

56
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,249
She is a child.

57
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,061
The only child on the island.
Please let her be so.

58
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:19,619
YOUNG DIANA: But, Mother...

59
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,088
There will be no training.

60
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,428
YOUNG DIANA: What if
I promised to be careful?

It's time to sleep.

62
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:37,670
What if I didn't use a sword?

63
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:40,373
Fighting does not
make you a hero.

64
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,843
Just a shield then.
No sharp edges.

65
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,712
(SIGHS) Diana, you are
the most precious thing

66
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,280
in the world to me.

67
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,917
I wished for you so much so,

68
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,052
I sculpted you
from clay myself,

69
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:54,855
and begged Zeus
to give you life.

70
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:57,057
You've told me this story.

71
00:05:57,124 --> 00:06:01,294
Which is why tonight
I will tell you a new one.

72
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,697
A story of our people,
and my days of battle.

73
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:05,866
Yes!

74
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,901
So you will
finally understand

75
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,536
why war is nothing
to hope for.

76
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,979
Long ago, when time was new

77
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:22,015
and all of history
was still a dream,

78
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,717
the gods ruled the Earth,

79
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,387
Zeus king among them.

80
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:33,693
Zeus created beings over which
the gods would rule.

81
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,129
Beings born in his image,

82
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:40,667
fair and good,
strong and passionate.

83
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:45,805
He called his creation "man."
And mankind was good.

84
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:49,009
But Zeus's son
grew envious of mankind

85
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:52,579
and sought to corrupt
his father's creation.

86
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,117
This was Ares, the God of War.

87
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:03,390
Ares poisoned men's hearts
with jealousy and suspicion.

88
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,758
He turned them
against one another

89
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:09,696
and war ravaged the Earth.

90
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,901
So, the gods created us,
the Amazons,

91
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,769
to influence
men's hearts with love

92
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,339
and restore peace
to the Earth.

93
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:25,612
And for a brief time,
there was peace.

94
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:33,053
ANTIOPE: But it did not last.

95
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:43,163
Your mother, the Amazon Queen,
led a revolt

96
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,366
that freed us all
from enslavement.

97
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,776
When Zeus led the gods
to our defense,

98
00:07:56,843 --> 00:08:00,013
Ares killed them one by one,

99
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,484
until only Zeus himself
remained.

100
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:09,856
HIPPOLYTA: Zeus used the last
of his power to stop Ares,

101
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:12,092
striking such a blow,

102
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,962
the God of War
was forced to retreat.

103
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:17,497
But Zeus knew

104
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:21,868
that one day, Ares might
return to finish his mission.

105
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:24,237
An endless war

106
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:27,740
where mankind would finally
destroy themselves,

107
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,510
and us with them.

108
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:33,113
ANTIOPE:
So Zeus left us a weapon,

109
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,450
one powerful enough
to kill a god.

110
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,986
HIPPOLYTA:
With his dying breath,

111
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,754
Zeus created this island

112
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,024
to hide us
from the outside world,

113
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,526
somewhere
Ares could not find us.

114
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,333
And all has been quiet
ever since.

115
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:05,278
We give thanks to the gods
for giving us this paradise.

116
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,715
And the Godkiller?

117
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,587
The Godkiller?

118
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,257
The weapon that's
strong enough to kill a god.

119
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,459
Can I see it?

120
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,938
The gods gave us many gifts.

121
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:34,141
One day, you'll know them all.

122
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,310
This great tower
is where we keep them.

123
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,091
The Godkiller.

124
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,329
It's beautiful.

125
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,199
Who would wield it?

126
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:04,671
I pray it will never be
called to arms.

127
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:08,141
But only the fiercest
among us even could.

128
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,343
And that is not you, Diana.

129
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,713
You see, you're safe

130
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,117
and there is nothing you
should concern yourself with.

00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:33,466
No, I don't.

No, I don't.

You are stronger

No, Mother, I'm fine,

00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,863
I was just...
Training.

143
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,100
It seems I'm not the
revered queen I should be.

Disobeyed,
betrayed by my own sister...

No, Mother.
It was me, I asked her to...

Take her to the palace.

00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:16,343
Off you go.

You left me no choice,
Hippolyta.

149

You neglect your duty
if she cannot fight.

You speak of a time

He might never return.

He could have died
from his wounds.

153

Ares is alive.

You feel it, as I do,
in your bones.

It is only a matter of time
before he returns.

The stronger she gets,
the sooner he'll find her.

Until she is better
than even you.

It's like nothing
I've ever seen.

339
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,280
It's like the world's
going to end.

340
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:04,416
Should we let him go?

341
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:07,286
And risk him bringing
more men to our shores?

342

We cannot hold him forever,
my queen.

343

Mother. Excuse me,

344
00:28:11,657 --> 00:28:15,594
but after everything the man
said, this must be Ares.

345

What are you
talking about, child?

346
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:18,530
Forgive me, Senator,

347
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:21,167
but the man called it
"a war without end."

348

Millions of people
already dead.

Like nothing he's ever seen.

350
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,574
Only Ares could do
such a thing.

351
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:34,045
We cannot simply let him go.
We must go with him.

352
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,814
I will not deploy our army

353
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,692

to go and fight their war.

354

It is not their war.

360
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:51,263
Yes, but Ares is behind
that corruption!

361

It is Ares who has
these Germans fighting.

362

It's a watch.
(CLEARS THROAT)

A watch?

383
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:34,766
Yeah, it's a watch.

It tells time.

it's still ticking.

390

Because it tells time.

Where are we?
Themyscira.

No, I got that before.
But I mean, where are we?

00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,478
What is this place?
Who are you people?

Why does the water do that?

How come you don't know
what a watch is?

How come you speak
English so well?

402

We speak hundreds
of languages.

403

We are the bridge to
a greater understanding

but it's not up to me.

to send me with you.

to go back?

00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:25,859
She actually helped me bring
this, uh, notebook back here.

the armistice
is of paramount importance.

it must be signed, and this is...

Well, it's the best way
of stopping the war.

897

you will do nothing.

2
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,641
- When'll you be back, Roy?
- In a couple of weeks.

3
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,852
Don't do nothing
you wouldn't want me to hear about.

4
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,147
- Well, so long.
- So long.

5
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,739
How about a lift, mister?

6
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:41,410
- Can't you see that sticker?
- Sure, I see it.

7
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,412
But a good guy don't pay no attention...

8
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,416
...to what some heel
makes him stick on his truck.

9
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:52,254
Well, scrunch down on the running board
till we get around the bend.

10
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,861
- Going far?
- No, just a couple of miles.

11
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,489
I'd have walked her
if my dogs wasn't pooped out.

12
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,619
- Looking for a job?
- No. My old man's got a place.

13
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:27,623
Forty acres. He's a sharecropper,
but we've been there a long while.

14
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,213
- Been doing a job?
- Yeah.

15
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:39,092
I seen your hands.
You been swinging a pick or a sledge.

16
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,055
That's what makes them shiny.
I notice little things like that all the time.

17
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,307
Got a trade?

18
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,810
- Why don't you get at it, buddy?
- Get at what?

19
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:53,148
You know. You been going over me since
I got in. Why don't you ask where I've been?

20
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,902
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
I stay in my own yard.

21
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,989
That big nose of yours been going over me
like a sheep in a vegetable patch.

22
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:05,577
Well, I ain't keeping it a secret. I've been
in the penitentiary. Been there four years.

23
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,829
- Anything else?
- You ain't gotta get sore.

24
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,957
- Ask me anything.
- I didn't mean nothing.

25
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:15,170
Me neither. I'm just trying to get along
without shoving anybody, that's all.

26
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:19,424
See that road ahead?
That's where I get out.

27
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,435
You're about to bust a gut
to know what I done, ain't you?

28
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,689
Well, I ain't a guy to let you down.

29
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,357
Homicide.

30
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,757
He's my savior

31
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,511
My savior

32
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,224
My savior now

33
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,936
- Howdy, friend.
- Howdy.

34
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,690
Say...

35
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,860
...ain't you young Tom Joad,
old Tom's boy?

36
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,029
Yeah.
I'm on my way home now.

37
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,157
Well, I do declare.

38
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,658
I baptized you, son.

39
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,619
Ain't you the preacher?

40
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,085
Used to be.

41
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,254
Not no more.

42
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,465
I lost the call.

43
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,719
But, boy, I sure used to have it.

44
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:49,264
I used to get an irrigation ditch
so full of repented sinners...

45
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,434
...I'd pretty near drown half of them.

46
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,686
But not no more.

47
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,648
I lost the spirit.

48
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:04,196
I got nothing to preach about
no more, that's all.

49
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,740
I ain't so sure of things.

50
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,326
I remember you preaching a sermon...

51
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,079
...walking around on your hands,
shouting your head off.

52
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,291
Yeah, I remember.

53
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,877
Went pretty good that way.

54
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,046
But that was nothing.

55
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,800
I preached a whole sermon once
straddling the ridge pole of a barn.

56
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,386
Like this:

57
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,100
- Did you see that one?
- No.

58
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,311
You didn't?

59
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,900
Well, it's all gone anyway.

60
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,153
You should have got yourself a wife.

61
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:51,159
Why, at my meetings, I used to get the girls
glory-shouting till they about passed out.

62
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,662
Then I'd go to comfort them.

63
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,748
I'd always end up by loving them.

64
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:01,503
I'd feel bad and pray and pray,
but it didn't do no good.

65
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,922
Next time, do it again.

66
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,633
I figured I just wasn't worth saving.

67
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:11,179
Yeah, Pa always says you was never
cut out for no preacher.

68
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:15,058
I never let one get by me
if I could catch her. Have a snort?

69
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:20,689
But you wasn't a preacher.
A girl was just a girl to you.

70
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:24,443
To me, they's holy vessels.

71
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,612
I was saving their souls.

72
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:34,327
I asked myself,
what is this here called Holy Spirit?

73
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,538
Maybe that's love.

74
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:42,878
Why, I love everybody so much
I'm fit to burst sometimes.

75
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:48,884
So maybe there ain't no sin
and there ain't no virtue.

76
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:52,304
It's just what people does.

77
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:59,853
Some things folks do is nice
and some ain't so nice...

78
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,023
...and that's all any man's
got a right to say.

79
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:08,111
Of course, I'll say a grace
if somebody sets out the food...

80
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,739
...but my heart ain't in it.

81
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,074
- Nice drinking liquor.
- Ought to be.

82
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,661
That's factory liquor.
Cost me a buck.

83
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:21,583
- You been out traveling around?
- Ain't you heard? It's been in the papers.

84
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,587
- No, I never. What?
- I've been in the penitentiary for four years.

85
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,298
Excuse me for asking.

86
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:35,180
I don't mind no more.
I'd do what I done again.

87
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,890
Killed a guy in a dance hall.

88
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:43,396
We was drunk. He got a knife in me
and I laid him out with a shovel.

89
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:47,108
- Knocked his head plumb to squash.
- You ain't ashamed?

90
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:51,112
No. He had a knife in me.
That's why they only gave me seven years.

91
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,865
I got out in four.
Parole.

92
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,911
- Ain't seen your folks since?
- No, but I aim to before sundown...

93
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,205
...and I'm getting excited about it too.

94
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,124
- Which way are you going?
- It don't matter.

95
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:07,629
Ever since I lost the spirit, looks like
I'd just as soon go one way as the other.

96
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,965
I'll go your way.

97
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,803
Maybe Ma will have pork for supper.

98
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:19,891
I ain't had pork but four times in four years.
Every Christmas.

99
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,018
I'll be glad to see your pa.

100
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:26,147
Last time I seen him was at a baptizing.

101
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:30,151
He had one of the biggest doses
of the Holy Spirit I ever seen.

102
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:34,990
Got to jumping over bushes.
Howling like a dog-wolf at moon-time.

103
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:39,578
Finally, he picks himself out
a bush big as a piano...

104
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:43,123
...and he lets out a squawk
and takes a run at that bush.

105
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,513
Well, he cleared her.

106
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:02,392
But he bust his leg snap in two doing it.
Ha.

107
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:07,105
There was a traveling dentist and he set
her and I gave her a praying over, but...

108
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:11,109
...there wasn't no more Holy Spirit
left in your pa after that.

109
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:19,826
- Listen. That wind's fixing to do something.
- Sure it is.

110
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,871
Always is this time of year.

111
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,904
Ma?

112
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,074
Pa?

113
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,786
Ma?

114
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,915
Ain't nobody here.

115
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,337
- Something's happened.
- You got a match?

116
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,443
They're all gone or dead.

117
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:39,989
- They never wrote you nothing?
- No. They wasn't people to write.

118
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,167
It's Ma's.
She had them for years.

119
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:16,818
Used to be mine.
I gave it to Grandpa when I went away.

120
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,492
You reckon they're dead?

121
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,328
I never heard nothing about it.

122
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,921
Tommy?

123
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,471
Muley.

124
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,348
- Where's my folks, Muley?
- Why, they gone.

125
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,976
I know they're gone,
but where are they gone?

126
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:54,147
It's Muley Graves.
You remember the preacher, don't you?

127
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,984
- I ain't no preacher anymore.
- All right. You remember the man?

128
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,987
- Glad to see you again.
- Now, where are my folks?

129
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:06,534
They gone. They gone to your Uncle John's.
The whole crowd of them. Two weeks ago.

130
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:10,038
But they can't stay there,
because John's got his notice to get off.

131
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,208
What happened?
How come they gotta get off?

132
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,169
We lived here 50 years, same place.

133
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:21,216
Everybody's gotta get off.
Everybody's leaving. Going out to California.

134
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,886
Your folks, my folks, everybody's folks.

135
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,389
Everybody except me.
I ain't getting off.

136
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,392
- Who done it?
- Listen.

137
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,397
That's some of what done it.
The dusters. They started it, anyways.

138
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,192
Blowing like this year after year.

139
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,487
Blowing the land away.
Blowing the crops away.

140
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,280
Blowing us away now.

141
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,243
Are you crazy?

142
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,329
Some say I am.
You wanna hear how it happened?

143
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,790
That's what I'm asking you, ain't it?

144
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,085
Well, the way it happens...

145
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,921
The way it happened to me...

146
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,090
A man come one day...

147
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:07,262
After what them dusters done to the land,
the tenant system don't work no more.

148
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,931
They don't even break even,
much less show profit.

149
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,518
One man and a tractor
can handle 12 or 14 of these places.

150
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,937
You just pay him a wage
and take all the crop.

151
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:21,276
Yeah, but we couldn't do on any less
than what our share is now.

152
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:25,947
The children ain't getting enough to eat
as it is. And they're so ragged...

153
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,617
...we'd be ashamed if everybody else's
children wasn't the same way.

154
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:33,454
I can't help that. I got my orders.
They told me to tell you to get off.

155
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,708
- That's what I'm telling you.
- You mean get off my own land?

156
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,211
- Don't go to blaming me. It ain't my fault.
- Whose fault is it?

157
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,631
You know who owns the land.
Shawnee Land and Cattle Company.

158
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,385
- Who's Shawnee Land and Cattle Company?
- It ain't nobody. It's a company.

159
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,890
They got a president, ain't they? They got
somebody who knows what a shotgun's for!

160
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,476
Son, it ain't his fault because
the bank tells him what to do.

161
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:59,814
- All right. Where's the bank?
- Tulsa. What's the use of picking on him?

162
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:04,569
He ain't nothing but the manager. He's half
crazy trying to keep up with his orders.

163
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,072
- Then who do we shoot?
- Brother, I don't know.

164
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,826
If I did, I'd tell you.
I just don't know who's to blame.

165
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,661
I'm right here to tell you, mister:

166
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,289
There ain't nobody
gonna push me off my land!

167
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,667
My grandpa took up this land
70 years ago!

168
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:23,046
My pa was born here.
We was all born on it!

169
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,633
And some of us was killed on it!

170
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:39,604
And some of us died on it.

171
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,106
That's what makes it our'n.

172
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,525
Being born on it...

173
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:48,154
...and working on it...

174
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,616
...and dying.
Dying on it!

175
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:56,746
And not no piece of paper
with writing on it.

176
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,343
Well, what happened?

177
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:17,558
They come.
They come and pushed me off.

178
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,852
- They come with the cats.
- The what?

179
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,398
The cats, the caterpillar tractors.

180
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,088
And for every one of them...

181
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:51,759
...there was 10, 15 families
thrown right out of their homes.

182
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:56,764
A hundred folks.
And no place to live but on the road.

183
00:16:56,932 --> 00:17:01,352
The Rances, the Peterses,
the Perrys, the Joadses.

184
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,230
One right after the other,
they got thrown out.

185
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:09,485
Half the folks you and me know
thrown right out into the road.

186
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:15,575
The one that got me come,
about a month ago.

187
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,785
Go on back!

188
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:22,415
Go on back!
I'm warning you, go on back!

189
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,969
You come any closer and I'm gonna
blow you right out of that cat!

190
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,306
I told you!

191
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,559
Why, you're Joe Davis' boy.

192
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,103
I don't like for nobody
to draw a bead on me.

193
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:47,315
Then what are you doing this for?
Against your own people.

194
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,234
Three dollars a day,
that's what I'm doing it for.

195
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:55,615
I got two little kids at home. My wife,
my wife's mother. Them folks gotta eat.

196
00:17:55,783 --> 00:18:00,161
First and only, I think about my folks.
What happens to others is their own lookout.

197
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,206
Yeah, but you don't understand, son.
This is my land!

198
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,125
Used to be your land.
It's the company's now.

199
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:11,339
Have it your own way, son. But just as sure
as you touch my house with that cat...

200
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,467
...I'm gonna blow you
plumb to kingdom come!

201
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:19,013
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere.
First place, they'd hang you and you know it.

202
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,600
It wouldn't be two days before
they'd send a guy to take my place.

203
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,519
Now go on!
Get out of the way!

204
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,062
What was the use?
He was right.

205
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,357
And there wasn't a thing in the world
I could do about it.

206
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:18,239
It's just, it don't seem possible
just getting throwed off like that.

207
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,075
The rest of my family set out
for the West.

208
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:26,497
There wasn't nothing to eat, but I couldn't
leave. Something just wouldn't let me.

209
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:34,213
So now I just wander around
and sleep wherever I am.

210
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,260
I used to tell myself
that I was looking out for things...

211
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:44,265
...so that when the folks come back,
everything would be all right.

212
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,435
But I knowed it wasn't true.

213
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,521
There ain't nothing to look out for...

214
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,066
...and there ain't nobody
ever coming back.

215
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,694
They're gone!

216
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,405
And me...

217
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:03,910
...I'm just an old graveyard ghost.

218
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,997
That's all in the world I am.

219
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,419
Do you think I'm touched?

220
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,508
No.

221
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,470
You're lonely, but...

222
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,138
...you ain't touched.

223
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:30,436
Well, it don't matter. If I'm touched,
I'm touched and that's all there is to it.

224
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:35,149
The thing I don't understand
is my folks taking it. Like Ma.

225
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,819
I seen her nearly beat a peddler
to death with a live chicken.

226
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,155
She aimed to go with an ax
in the other hand...

227
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,574
...got mixed up, forgot which was which.

228
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:47,954
When she got through with that peddler,
all she had left was two chicken legs.

229
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,581
Just a...

230
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:55,169
Just a plain old graveyard ghost.

231
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,505
That's all.

232
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,188
She's settling.

233
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,569
What do you figure on doing?

234
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,947
It's hard to say.

235
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:27,159
Stay here till morning,
go to Uncle John's, I reckon.

236
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,829
After that, I don't know.

237
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,999
Listen.

238
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,550
That's them.
Them lights.

239
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,512
Come on. Come on.
We gotta hide out.

240
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,974
Hide out for what?
We ain't doing nothing.

241
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:55,354
You're trespassing. This ain't your land no
more. That's the superintendent with a gun.

242
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:59,108
- Come on!
- Come on, Tom. You're on parole.

243
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,924
Muley!

244
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:41,233
All you gotta do is hide and watch.

245
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:45,112
- Won't they come out here?
- I don't think so.

246
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,490
- One came out once and I clipped him...
- Shh!

247
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,117
From behind with a fence stake.

248
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,870
They ain't bothered since.

249
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,502
He ain't here.

250
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:13,849
Anybody ever told me
I'd be hiding out at my own place...

251
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:32,243
Lord, make us grateful
for what we are about to receive...

252
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,496
...for his sake.
Amen.

253
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,082
I seen you.
You ate during grace.

254
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,627
Just one little dab.
Just one teeny little old dab, that's all.

255
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:46,757
- Ain't he messy though.
- I seen him. Gobbling away like an old pig.

256
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,635
Why don't you keep your eyes shut
during grace, you old...?

257
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:52,012
What's it say again, Uncle John?

258
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:58,018
It says, "Plenty of work in California.
Eight hundred pickers wanted."

259
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,152
Wait till I get to California.

260
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,822
I'm gonna reach up and pick me
an orange whenever I want it.

261
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:14,702
Or some grapes. Now, there's something
I ain't never had enough of.

262
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,080
I'm gonna get me a whole
big bunch of grapes off a bush...

263
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,791
...and I'm gonna squash them
all over my face...

264
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,794
...and let the juice
drain down off of my chin.

265
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,338
Praise the Lord for victory!

266
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:29,717
Maybe I'll get me
a whole washtub full of grapes...

267
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:36,056
...and just sit in them and scrounge
around in them until they're all gone.

268
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,810
I sure would like that.

269
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:45,232
Yes, sir, I sure would like that.

270
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,587
Oh, thank God.
Thank God.

271
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,924
Tommy.

272
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,722
Ma.

273
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,064
You didn't bust out, did you?
You ain't gotta hide?

274
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,776
No, Ma. I'm paroled.
I got my papers.

275
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,781
I was so scared
we was going away without you...

276
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:37,284
...and we'd never see each other again.

277
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,079
I'd have found you, Ma.

278
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,460
Muley told me what happened.

279
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,629
We going to California true?

280
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,590
We've gotta go, Tommy,
but it's gonna be all right.

281
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:57,137
I seen the handbills about how much
work there is, and high wages too.

282
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:02,977
There's something I gotta find out first,
Tommy. Did they hurt you, son?

283
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,271
Did they hurt you and make you mean mad?

284
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:06,605
Mad, Ma?

285
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:10,609
- Sometimes they do.
- No, Ma. I was at first, but not no more.

286
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,570
Sometimes they do something to you.

287
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,490
They hurt you and you get mad
and then you get mean.

288
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:19,743
And they hurt you again
and you get meaner and meaner...

289
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:25,124
...till you ain't no boy nor man anymore,
just a walking chunk of mean mad.

290
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:29,336
- Did they hurt you that way, son?
- No, Ma. Don't worry about that.

291
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,088
Well, I...

292
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,507
I don't want no mean son.

293
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,635
- It's Tommy. It's Tommy back!
- Tommy!

294
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,013
What'd you do, son?
Bust out?

295
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,181
Tommy's out of jail!

296
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:46,604
I knowed it! You couldn't keep him in.
You can't keep a Joad in jail.

297
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,106
I knowed it from the first.

298
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:54,987
Get out of my way! I told you so. I told you
Tom would come busting out of that jail...

299
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:59,700
...just like a bull through a corral fence.
You can't keep a Joad in jail!

300
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:03,495
- I didn't bust out. They paroled me.
- I was that way myself.

301
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:08,542
- How are you, Uncle John?
- Hello, Tommy. I'm feeling fine.

302
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,880
- How are you, Noah?
- Fine, Tommy. Bust out?

303
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,299
No, parole.

304
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,842
- Hello.
- Tommy!

305
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:24,391
The jailbird's back!
The jailbird's back!

306
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,144
The jailbird's back.

307
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,104
The jailbird's back!

308
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:32,066
- Hi, Al.
- Hello, Tom.

309
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:36,403
- Did you bust out of jail?
- No, they paroled me.

310
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:39,031
Rosasharn.

311
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,033
Busted out.

312
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,244
That's Connie Rivers with her.
They're married now.

313
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:47,081
She's due now about three, four months.

314
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:51,585
She wasn't any more than a kid
when I went up.

315
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,715
- Hi, Rosasharn.
- How are you, Tom?

316
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,469
This is Connie, my husband.

317
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,764
- Did you...?
- No, parole.

318
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:08,894
If this don't beat all.
I see I'm gonna be an uncle soon.

319
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,104
You do not see.

320
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,190
Look at her blush, I tell you.

321
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,443
- Look at her blush.
- Look at her blushing.

322
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:28,414
Hey, Joad!
John Joad.

323
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,048
- You ain't forgot, have you?
- We ain't forgot.

324
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,885
- We'll be coming through here tomorrow.
- I know.

325
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,805
We be out.
We be out by sunup.

326
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,365
How'd you get all this money?

327
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,995
Sold things, chopped cotton.
Even Grandpa.

328
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:13,500
Got us about $200 all told.
Shucked out 75 for this here truck.

329
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:18,672
Still got nearly 150 to set out on. I figure
we ought to be able to make her on that.

330
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,760
Easy. After all,
they ain't but about 12 of us, is they?

331
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,764
She'll probably ride like a bull calf,
but she'll ride.

332
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:31,101
Well, I reckon we better begin rousting
them out if we aim to get out by daylight.

333
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,353
How about it, John?
How are you boys coming?

334
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,947
Ma.

335
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,157
I'm ready.

336
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:21,962
Rosasharn, honey. Wake up the children.
We're fixing to leave.

337
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,133
Ruthie. Winfield.
Jump up now.

338
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,261
Where's Grandpa?
Al, go get him.

339
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,556
I'm gonna get up front.
Somebody help me.

340
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,099
Wait.
Somebody help me.

341
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:37,644
- Kids, you climb up on top first.
- We're going to California!

342
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:41,607
Al's gonna drive, Ma. Sit with him and
Grandma, and we'll swap around later.

343
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:46,486
Connie, help Rosasharn up there
alongside the kids.

344
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,324
- Where's Grandpa?
- Grandpa!

345
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,410
Where he always is, probably.

346
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:58,123
Grandpa!
Grandpa!

347
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:02,085
Well, save him a place. John, you
and Noah climb up and find a place.

348
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,339
Gotta kind of keep her even all around.

349
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,308
You think it'll hold?

350
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:20,020
If it does, it'll be
a miracle out of Scripture.

351
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,022
Ma.
Pa.

352
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,441
Let go of me, goldurn you!

353
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:29,363
No, Pa, please.
There's something the matter with Pa.

354
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:33,200
- Why don't you stand still?!
- There's something wrong with him.

355
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:40,874
You let me alone, that's all.
That's all.

356
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:44,127
What's the matter, Grandpa?

357
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:48,298
What's the matter?
There's nothing the matter. I just...

358
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:52,052
- I just ain't going, that's all.
- What do you mean? We gotta go.

359
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,137
We got no place to stay.

360
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:58,684
I ain't talking about you,
I'm talking about me.

361
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:03,730
I give her a good going-over
all last night and I'm staying.

362
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:08,068
But you can't do that, Grandpa.
This here land's going under the tractor.

363
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:12,489
- We all gotta get out.
- All except me and I'm staying.

364
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,700
- What about Grandma?
- Take her with you!

365
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,996
Who'd cook for you, Grandpa?
How you gonna live?

366
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:24,543
Muley's living, ain't he?
And I'm twice the man that Muley is.

367
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,921
Now, listen to me, Grandpa.
Listen to me just a minute.

368
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,007
And I ain't listening either.

369
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:35,762
I told you what I was gonna do,
and I don't give a hoot and a holler...

370
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,599
...if there's oranges and grapes
crowding a fella out of bed.

371
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:43,186
I ain't going to California!

372
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:48,358
Goldurn!
This is my country and I belong here.

373
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,652
Yes, sir.

374
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,739
It's my dirt.

375
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,867
It's no good, but it's...

376
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,203
It's mine, all mine.

377
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,290
Either we gotta tie him up
and throw him in the truck...

378
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,208
...or something.
He can't stay here.

379
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:10,547
No, can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him
or he'll get so mad, he'll hurt himself.

380
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,925
- Reckon we could get him drunk?
- Ain't no whiskey, is there?

381
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:18,764
Now, wait. There's a half a bottle
of soothing syrup here.

382
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:24,936
Here.
Used to put the children to sleep.

383
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:30,233
- Don't taste bad.
- There's coffee left. We can fix him a cup.

384
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,737
- That's right, douse some in it.
- Better give him a good dose.

385
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,947
He's mighty muleheaded.

386
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,408
If Muley...

387
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,828
If Muley can scramble along, I...

388
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,623
I guess I can.

389
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,419
I smell spareribs.

390
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:54,841
Somebody's been eating spareribs.
How come I ain't got none?

391
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:58,678
Well, I got some saved for you, Grandpa.
Got some warming now.

392
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:02,641
And here's a cup of coffee for you first.

393
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,685
Get me a mess of spareribs.

394
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:09,689
I want a great big mess of spareribs.

395
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:14,986
- I'm... I'm hungry.
- Why, sure you're hungry.

396
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:28,708
I sure do like spareribs.

397
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:39,761
- Get up there, Noah.
- Put his feet in there first, Tom.

398
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,181
Easy, now.
Easy!

399
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,228
Better throw something over him
so he won't get sunstruck.

400
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:53,400
Everything all set now?
All right, let her go, Al.

401
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,987
Get aboard, Ma.

402
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:01,074
- Well, goodbye and good luck.
- Hold her, Al.

403
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,535
Ain't you going with us?

404
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,953
I'd like to.

405
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,789
There's something going on
there in the West...

406
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:10,876
...and I'd like to try and learn what it is...

407
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,794
...if you feel you've got the room.

408
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,883
Plenty of room.
Get on.

409
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:21,428
- Let her go, Al!
- California, here we come!

410
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,784
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?
Give the old place a last look?

411
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:49,080
We're going to California, ain't we?
All right then, let's go to California.

412
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:52,292
That don't sound like you, Ma.
You never was like that before.

413
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,670
I never had my house pushed over before.

414
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,797
Never had my family
stuck out on the road.

415
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:02,594
Never had to lose
everything I had in life.

416
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,709
- I... I ain't going.
- It's gonna be all right, Grandpa.

417
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:21,006
I ain't going.
I ain't going. I ain't going.

418
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:24,384
I ain't going.

419
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,388
It's all right, Grandpa.

420
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,725
You're just tired, that's all.

421
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,352
That's it.

422
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,689
Just tired.

423
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,483
Just...

424
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,486
...tired.

425
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:21,524
"This here is William James Joad.
Died of a stroke, old, old man.

426
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,735
His folks buried him...

427
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:29,908
...because they got no money
to pay for funerals.

428
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:41,669
Nobody killed him.
Just a stroke and he died."

429
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:48,426
I figure best we leave
something like this on him...

430
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:52,764
...lest somebody digs him up
and makes out he was killed.

431
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,058
Looks like a lot of times...

432
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,812
...the government's got more interest
in a dead man than a live one.

433
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:02,482
Not be so lonesome,
knowing his name's there with him.

434
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,652
Not just an old fella
lonesome underground.

435
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,573
Would you say a few words, Casy?

436
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,493
I ain't a preacher no more, you know.

437
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:19,916
We know, but ain't none of our folks
ever been buried without a few words.

438
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:26,506
I'll say them, make it short.

439
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,848
This here old man just...

440
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,183
...lived a life and just died out of it.

441
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:41,646
I don't know
whether he was good or bad...

442
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,399
...and it don't matter much.

443
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,902
Heard a fella say a poem once.

444
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,865
And he says, "All that lives is holy."

445
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:55,785
Well, I wouldn't pray
just for an old man that's dead...

446
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,538
...because he's all right.

447
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:04,752
If I was to pray, I'd pray for folks that's
alive and don't know which way to turn.

448
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,464
Grandpa here...

449
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,924
...he ain't got no more trouble like that.

450
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,428
He's got his job all cut out for him...

451
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:17,223
...so cover him up and let him get to it.

452
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:14,906
I'm going down the road feeling bad

453
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:23,115
I'm going down the road feeling bad

454
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,294
Oh Lordy

455
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:34,092
I ain't a-gonna be a-treated this way

456
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:43,386
They fed me on corn bread and beans

457
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,943
Gosh, Connie sure sings pretty, don't he?

458
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,196
And beans, oh Lordy

459
00:42:55,614 --> 00:43:01,327
I ain't a-gonna be a-treated this way

460
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:09,586
- That's my son-in-law.
- Sings real nice. What state you all from?

461
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:13,673
Oklahoma.
Had us a farm there, sharecropping.

462
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,509
We're from Arkansas.

463
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:21,222
Had me a store there.
Kind of a general notions store.

464
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:25,476
When the farms went, the stores went too.

465
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:29,606
I had as nice a little store
as you ever saw.

466
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,817
I sure did hate to give it up.

467
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,653
Well, you can't tell.

468
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:38,656
I figure when we get out there
and get work...

469
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:43,119
...and maybe get us a piece of growing land
near water, it might not be so bad at that.

470
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,997
That's right.
Paying good wages, I hear.

471
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:49,792
- We can all get work.
- Can't be no worse than home.

472
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,544
You all must have a pot of money.

473
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,213
No, we ain't got no money...

474
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:57,216
...but there's plenty of us to work
and we're all good men.

475
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:00,887
Get good wages out there and put it
all together, and we'll be all right.

476
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,725
Good wages?
Picking oranges and peaches?

477
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:09,103
- Well, we aim to take whatever they got.
- What's so funny about that?

478
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:13,107
What's so funny about it?
I've just been out there.

479
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:17,028
I've been and seen it.
I'm going back and starve...

480
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,739
...because I'd rather starve
all over at once.

481
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,283
Say, what do you think
you're talking about?

482
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:25,495
I got a handbill here
says they're paying good wages.

483
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,872
And I seen in the papers
they need pickers.

484
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,708
All right, go on.
Nobody's stopping you.

485
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:34,212
- Yeah, but what about this?
- I ain't gonna rile you. Go on.

486
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,716
Wait a minute, buddy. You just done
some jackassing. You can't shut up now.

487
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:43,846
It says they need 800 pickers. You laugh
and say they don't. Which one's the liar?

488
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,224
- How many of you got them handbills?
- I got one.

489
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,517
Come on, how many?

490
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,436
- I got one.
- We all got one.

491
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:56,109
- What does that prove?
- There you are. Same yellow handbill.

492
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,236
Eight hundred pickers wanted.

493
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:03,116
All right, the man wants 800 men.
So he prints 5,000 handbills...

494
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:05,535
...and maybe 20,000 people see them.

495
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:09,330
And maybe 2- or 3,000 people start west
on account of that handbill.

496
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:13,376
Two or 3,000 people
that are crazy with worry...

497
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:17,130
...heading out for 800 jobs.
Now, does that make sense?

498
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:22,051
Say, what are you, a troublemaker?
You sure you ain't one of them labor fakes?

499
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,137
I... I swear I ain't, mister.

500
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,973
Don't you go around here
trying to stir up any trouble.

501
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:32,311
I tried to tell you folks
what it took me a year to find out.

502
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:39,068
Took two kids dead. Took my wife dead to
show me. But nobody could tell me neither.

503
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,738
I can't tell you about them little fellas...

504
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,741
...laying in the tent
with their bellies swelled out...

505
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:47,076
...and just skin over their bones.

506
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,996
Shivering and whining like pups.

507
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,206
And me running around looking for work.

508
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,835
Not for money, not for wages.

509
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:59,005
Just for a cup of flour
and a spoon of lard.

510
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,215
Then the coroner come.

511
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:06,471
"Them children died of heart failure,"
he said. He put it down in his paper.

512
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,639
Heart failure?

513
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:12,685
And their little bellies
stuck out like a pig bladder.

514
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,524
Well, it's late.
I gotta get some sleep.

515
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,111
Well...

516
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,363
Good night, folks.

517
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:40,671
Suppose he's telling the truth, that fella?

518
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,091
He's telling the truth.

519
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:46,594
The truth for him.

520
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:49,180
He wasn't making it up.

521
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:52,016
Was it the truth for us?

522
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:54,227
I don't know.

523
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:46,737
I gotta get out, I tell you.

524
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:49,699
I gotta get out now.

525
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:01,711
- You folks aim to buy anything?
- We want some gas, mister.

526
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:05,298
- Got any money?
- What do you think, we're begging?

527
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:10,803
- I just asked, that's all.
- Well, ask right. You ain't talking to bums.

528
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:14,473
All in the world I done was ask.

529
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:18,644
- What kind of pie you got?
- Banana, pineapple, chocolate and apple.

530
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:21,397
Cut me a hunk of that banana cream
and a cup of java.

531
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,983
- Make it two.
- Two it is.

532
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,777
Seen any good etchings lately, Bill?

533
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:31,866
Well, this one ain't bad. A little kid comes
late for school and the teacher says...

534
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,784
Cheese it.

535
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,997
Could you see your way clear
to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am?

536
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:41,626
This ain't a grocery store.
We got bread to make sandwiches with.

537
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:45,922
I know, ma'am.
Only, it's for an old lady.

538
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:51,010
No teeth. Got to soften it with water
so she can chew it, and she's hungry.

539
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,679
Why don't you buy a sandwich?
We got nice sandwiches.

540
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:59,727
Well, I sure would like to do that, ma'am,
but the fact is, we ain't got but a dime for it.

541
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:02,355
It's all figured out, I mean for the trip.

542
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:06,776
You can't buy no loaf of bread for a dime.
We only got 15-cent loaves.

543
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:10,196
- Give him the bread.
- We'll run out before the bread truck comes.

544
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,864
All right, then we run out!

545
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,600
This here's a 15-cent loaf.

546
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:43,729
Well, would you...? Could you see your way
to cutting off 10 cents worth?

547
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:48,901
- Give him the loaf.
- No, sir. We wanna buy 10 cents worth.

548
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,153
Go on, it's yesterday's bread.

549
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:55,032
Go ahead.
Bert says to take it.

550
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:00,621
Well, it may sound funny, being so tight,
but we got 1,000 miles to go...

551
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:03,499
...and we don't know if we'll make it.

552
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:12,174
Is them penny candies, ma'am?

553
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,677
- Which ones?
- There, them stripy ones.

554
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,179
Oh, them.

555
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:20,057
Well, no.

556
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:23,102
- Them's two for a penny.
- Give us two then, ma'am.

557
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:31,193
Go on, take them, take them.

558
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,612
Thank you, ma'am.

559
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:44,915
- Them ain't two-for-a-cent candy.
- What's it to you?

560
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:50,046
- Them's a-nickel-apiece candy.
- We better get going. We're dropping time.

561
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,220
- So long.
- Wait a minute, you got change coming.

562
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,473
What's it to you?

563
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,982
Bert.

564
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:13,319
Look.

565
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:17,156
Truck drivers.

566
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,197
- Where you going?
- California.

567
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:01,700
- How long you plan to be in Arizona?
- No longer than to get across.

568
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:05,371
- Got any plants?
- No, no plants.

569
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:11,544
- Okay, go ahead, but keep moving.
- We aim to.

570
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:37,755
Well, there she is, folks.
The land of milk and honey.

571
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:38,964
California.

572
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,181
Well, if that's what
we came out here for...

573
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,808
Well, Connie,
maybe it's nice on the other side.

574
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:53,103
Them picture postcards,
they was real pretty.

575
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:57,441
There, Grandma.
There's California.

576
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:06,700
Let's get going.
She don't look so tough to me, John?

577
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:09,495
Well, I don't know.

578
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,094
Hold on.

579
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:17,146
- Ain't too cold, is she, Tom?
- No, it's fine when you get in, Pa.

580
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,733
Come on, John.
Let's give her a whirl.

581
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,996
This is supposed to be
good for you, John.

582
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:38,917
- Come on, Pa, before she floats away.
- Here we come.

583
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:46,050
- You people got a lot of nerve.
- What do you mean?

584
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:49,678
- Crossing the desert in a jalopy like this.
- You been across?

585
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:53,724
Sure, plenty.
But never in no wreck like that.

586
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,393
If we break down,
maybe somebody'd give us a hand.

587
00:55:56,561 --> 00:56:00,272
Well, maybe, but I'd hate to be doing it.
Takes more nerve than I got.

588
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,650
Don't take no nerve to do something,
ain't nothing else you can do.

589
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:05,277
Hope she holds.

590
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,293
Grandpa.

591
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:30,177
I want Grandpa.

592
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:33,514
I want...

593
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:35,974
...Grandpa.

594
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:39,311
Don't you fret now.

595
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:42,022
There.

596
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:45,651
Don't you fret now, Grandma.

597
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:48,320
- Everybody set back there?
- Yeah.

598
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,531
Here we go.

599
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:52,991
Thank you very much.

600
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,546
- Holy Moses, what a hard-looking outfit.
- All them Okies is hard-looking.

601
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:09,216
Boy, but I'd hate to hit that desert
in a jalopy like that.

602
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:13,971
You and me got sense.
Them Okies got no sense and no feeling.

603
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:18,809
They ain't human.
No human being would live the way they do.

604
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:22,438
A human being couldn't stand
to be so miserable.

605
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:25,732
Just don't know any better, I guess.

606
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:50,966
What a place.
How would you like to walk across it?

607
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:54,595
People done it.
If they could, we could.

608
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:57,222
Lots must have died too.

609
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:00,350
Well, we ain't out of it yet.

610
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:08,192
- This here's the desert. We're right in it.
- I wish it was day.

611
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:13,113
Tom says if it was day,
it'd cut the gizzard right out of you.

612
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:16,283
I seen a picture once
and there was bones everywhere.

613
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:20,996
- Man bones?
- Some, I guess. But mostly cow bones.

614
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:25,417
I sure would like to see
some of them man bones.

615
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,841
Grandpa.
I want Grandpa.

616
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:36,386
Yes.
Now, everything's going to be all right.

617
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:42,309
We got to get across, Grandma.
The family's got to get across.

618
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,645
There.

619
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:56,949
Seems like we wasn't ever doing
nothing but moving. I'm tired.

620
00:58:57,116 --> 00:59:00,118
Women's always tired.

621
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:04,248
You ain't?
You ain't sorry, are you, honey?

622
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:06,291
No, but...

623
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:11,046
But you seen that advertisement
in the Spicy Western Story magazine.

624
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:16,760
Don't pay nothing. Just send them
the coupon and you're a radio expert.

625
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,304
Nice, clean work.

626
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,473
But we can still do it, honey.

627
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:25,644
I ought to have done it then,
not come on any trip like this.

628
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:52,504
- What's this here?
- Agricultural inspection.

629
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:55,340
We gotta go over your stuff.
Got any vegetables or seed?

630
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:56,592
No.

631
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:59,469
We gotta look over your stuff.
You gotta unload.

632
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:03,682
Unload?
Holy Moses.

633
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:15,777
You'll have to get out
while we unload for inspection.

634
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:18,155
Look, mister, we've got a sick old lady.

635
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:21,491
We gotta get her to a doctor.
We can't wait. You can't make us wait.

636
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,535
Yeah?
Well, we gotta look you over.

637
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:26,830
Well, I swear we ain't got anything.
I swear it.

638
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:29,249
Grandma's awful sick.

639
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,251
Look.

640
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,382
You wasn't fooling.

641
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,679
- You swear you got no fruit or vegetables?
- No, I swear it.

642
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:45,891
Then go ahead. Get a doctor at Barstow.
That's just eight miles.

643
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:47,809
But don't stop or get off.
Understand?

644
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:49,895
- Thank you.
- Okay, cap. Much obliged.

645
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,563
Thanks.

646
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,884
Ma! Grandma!
Look!

647
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:38,026
There she is. There she is.
I never knowed there was anything like her.

648
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:41,947
- Will you look at her?
- Look yonder, John.

649
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,741
Look how pretty and green it is, Winfield.

650
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:48,537
- Wonder if them's orange trees, John.
- Look like orange trees to me.

651
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,498
- They sure are pretty, whatever they are.
- Yes, indeed.

652
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:55,919
Look at them haystacks. I bet
we sure could have fun playing over there.

653
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:59,631
Pretty, ain't it?
Mighty pretty. Tom.

654
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:03,301
Where's Ma? I want Ma to see this.
Look, Ma. Come here, Ma.

655
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:05,137
Come on.

656
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:10,809
- You sick, Ma?
- You say we got across?

657
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:12,728
Look.

658
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:15,272
Thank God.

659
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,526
And we're still together.
Most of us.

660
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:22,195
Didn't you sleep none?

661
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:25,949
- Was Grandma bad?
- Grandma's dead.

662
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,410
When?

663
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:34,124
- Since before they stopped us last night.
- That's why you didn't want them to look?

664
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:38,503
I was afraid they'd stop us
and we wouldn't get across.

665
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:42,424
I told Grandma.

666
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:47,512
I told her when she was dying.
I told her the family had to get across.

667
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:52,350
I told her we couldn't take no chance
on being stopped.

668
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:56,938
So it's all right.

669
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:59,524
She'll get buried
where it's nice and green...

670
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:03,945
...and trees and flowers all around and...

671
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:10,202
She got to lay her head down
in California after all.

672
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:34,059
How far you figure
you gonna get that way, pushing?

673
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:37,312
Right here.
We run out of gas.

674
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:41,858
Where's the best place to get work
around here? Don't matter what kind either.

675
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:45,237
If I've seen one of them things,
I've seen 10,000 of them.

676
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:49,616
- Why? Ain't it no good?
- Not here. Not now.

677
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:54,079
There was some picking around here
about a month ago, but it's all moved south.

678
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:57,249
- What part of Oklahoma you from, anyhow?
- Sallisaw.

679
01:03:57,416 --> 01:04:01,711
Sallisaw? Well, I come out from Cherokee
County myself about two years ago.

680
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:04,297
- Cherokee County! Gee!
- Oh, boy!

681
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:09,719
- Connie's folks are from Cherokee County.
- Well, you don't say!

682
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:13,473
All right, all right.
Let's don't go into it.

683
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,433
What I gotta tell you is this:

684
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:19,145
Don't try to park in town tonight.
Just go right on out to that camp.

685
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:21,857
If I catch you in town after dark,
I gotta lock you up.

686
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:26,319
- But what are we gonna do?
- Well, Pop, that just ain't up to me.

687
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:31,616
The guy they ought to lock up
is the guy that sent them things out.

688
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:38,206
How many, folks?

689
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,208
One.

690
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:11,007
Sure don't look none too prosperous.

691
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:14,886
- Wanna go somewhere else?
- On a gallon of gas?

692
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:18,723
Let's set up the tent
and maybe I can fix some stew.

693
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:47,210
I could break up some brush
if you want me, ma'am.

694
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:50,755
- You wanna be asked to eat, don't you?
- Yes, ma'am.

695
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:55,010
- Didn't you have no breakfast?
- No, ma'am. There ain't no work hereabouts.

696
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:58,680
Pa's been trying to sell some stuff
to get gas, so as we can get along.

697
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:01,391
Didn't none of these have no breakfast?

698
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:07,731
I did. Me and my brother did.
We ate good.

699
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:12,193
- Well, you ain't hungry then, are you?
- We ate good.

700
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:16,489
I'm glad some of you ain't hungry.
There won't be enough to go all around.

701
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:18,908
He was bragging.
Know what he done?

702
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:21,870
Last night, come out
and say they got chicken to eat.

703
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:26,458
Well, I looked in whilst they was eating and
it was fried dough, just like everybody else.

704
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,211
Ma?
How about it?

705
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:33,965
Well, I don't know what to do.
I've got to feed the family.

706
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:37,302
And what am I gonna do
about all these here?

707
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:46,478
Give this to Ruthie.

708
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:48,396
Here.

709
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:54,986
There you are, John.

710
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:07,999
Here, Tom. You take it.
I ain't hungry.

711
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:12,420
- What do you mean? You ain't ate today.
- I know, but I got a stomachache.

712
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,839
I ain't hungry.

713
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:21,429
- Take that plate in the tent and you eat it.
- It wouldn't be no use. I'd still see them.

714
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:25,391
You get.
Go on now. Get.

715
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:28,686
You ain't doing no good.
There ain't enough for youse anyway.

716
01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:33,608
Go on now.

717
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:47,956
You can't send them away.

718
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:51,835
Here.
Take your plates and go inside.

719
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:56,965
Now, look, all you little fellas.
You each go and get you a nice flat stick...

720
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,926
...and I'll put what's left for you?

721
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:02,137
Now get.

722
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:10,395
I don't know whether
I'm doing right or not.

723
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:16,234
Get inside.
Get inside, everybody, and stay inside.

724
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:20,280
Lady's gonna feed us.
Get yourself a tin can.

725
01:09:33,794 --> 01:09:36,546
- Come on. Give me some.
- You're taking too much.

726
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,070
You men wanna work?

727
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:05,533
Sure, we wanna work.
Where's it at?

728
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:09,287
Tovaris County. Fruit's opening up.
Need a lot of fruit pickers.

729
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:13,458
- You doing the hiring?
- Well, I'm contracting the land.

730
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:14,959
What you paying?

731
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:19,047
Well, can't tell exactly yet.
About, 30 cents, I guess.

732
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:22,634
Why can't you tell?
You took the contract, didn't you?

733
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:24,928
That's true, but it's keyed to the price.

734
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:27,305
Might be a little more,
might be a little less.

735
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,474
All right, mister.
I'll go.

736
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:34,646
You just show us your license to contract,
then you make out an order.

737
01:10:34,813 --> 01:10:38,316
Where, and when and how much you're
gonna pay. You sign it and we'll go.

738
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:41,444
Now, listen, smart guy.
I'll run my business my own way.

739
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:44,113
I got work.
If you wanna take it, okay.

740
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:47,158
If not, just sit here, that's all.

741
01:10:47,993 --> 01:10:50,662
Twice now I fell for that line.

742
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:56,417
Maybe he needs 1,000 men. So he gets
5,000 there and he'll pay 15 cents an hour.

743
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:59,462
You guys will have to take it
because you'll be hungry.

744
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:03,091
If he wants to hire men, let him write it out
and say what he's gonna pay.

745
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:07,011
Ask to see his license. He ain't allowed
to contract men without a license.

746
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:09,347
Hey, Joe.

747
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,557
Agitator.

748
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:21,109
- Ever see this guy before?
- Seems like I have.

749
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:25,780
Seems like I seen him hanging around
a used-car lot that was busted into.

750
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:28,825
Yep, that's the fella.
Get in this car.

751
01:11:29,493 --> 01:11:32,996
- You got nothing on him.
- Open your trap again and you'll go too.

752
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:35,540
You don't wanna listen to troublemakers.

753
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:38,042
You better all pack
and come to Tovaris County.

754
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:39,877
Come on, you.

755
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:16,581
Give me that gun. Now get out of here.
Go down to the willows and wait.

756
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:20,209
- I ain't gonna run.
- Why, the sheriff, he seen you, Tom.

757
01:12:20,377 --> 01:12:25,256
You wanna get fingerprinted?
You wanna be sent back for breaking parole?

758
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:27,508
I guess you're right.

759
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:31,179
Hide in the willows.
If it's all right to come back...

760
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,765
...I'll give you four high whistles.

761
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:03,795
- What's going on here?
- This man of yours...

762
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:05,713
...he got tough so I hit him.

763
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:10,134
Then he started shooting.
Hit that woman there, so I hit him again.

764
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:12,470
Well, what'd you do in the first place?

765
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:14,889
I talked back.

766
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:18,476
Is this the fella that hit you?

767
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:22,313
- Don't look like him.
- It was me, all right.

768
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:24,899
You just got smart with the wrong fella.

769
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:27,443
Get in that car.

770
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:50,007
This lady's bleeding to death.

771
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:53,678
Boy, what a mess them.45s make.

772
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:56,139
Better get the doc.

773
01:14:34,094 --> 01:14:35,845
Al.

774
01:14:36,513 --> 01:14:39,056
- You can come in now.
- We gotta get out of here.

775
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:40,391
Guy in the willows said...

776
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:43,728
...them poolroom fellas
figure on burning the camp out.

777
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:47,148
We gotta get the truck loaded.
Ma.

778
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,150
Pa.

779
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:56,073
- What are you doing with the jack handle?
- She just got sassy, that's all.

780
01:14:57,701 --> 01:15:00,953
Well, we'll fight it out later.
We gotta hustle. Where's Connie?

781
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:02,914
Well, Tom, he's gone.

782
01:15:03,081 --> 01:15:07,084
He lit out this evening. Said he
didn't know it was going to be like this.

783
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:08,377
Glad to get shot of him.

784
01:15:08,545 --> 01:15:10,421
- Never was no good, never will be.
- Pa, shh!

785
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:13,049
How come I got to shh?
Run out on us, didn't he?

786
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:15,426
Cut it out, Pa.
Help Al with the truck.

787
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:18,930
Some of the fellas in town,
they're gonna burn out the camp tonight.

788
01:15:30,234 --> 01:15:32,068
Don't fret, honey.
You'll be all right.

789
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:42,703
Tom, I just don't feel like nothing at all.

790
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:47,166
Without him, I just don't wanna live.

791
01:15:49,753 --> 01:15:53,297
He'll be back.
We'll leave word for him.

792
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:54,799
Just don't you worry.

793
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:13,025
Get on.
Ma, you and Rosasharn climb up.

794
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:50,813
Ma.

795
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:55,359
Maybe... Maybe Connie gone
to get some books to study up with.

796
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:58,529
He gonna be a radio expert, you know.

797
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:00,865
Maybe he figured to surprise us.

798
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:04,160
Maybe that's just what he done.

799
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:07,705
Ma, there comes a time
when a man gets mad.

800
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:10,541
- You promised me...
- I know, Ma. I'm trying to.

801
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:13,961
If there was a law, maybe we could take it.
But it ain't the law.

802
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:15,796
They're working on our spirits...

803
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:18,841
...trying to make us cringe and crawl,
working on our decency.

804
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:22,136
- You promised, Tom.
- I know. I'm trying to, Ma. Honest I am.

805
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:25,890
You gotta keep clear. The family's
breaking up. You gotta keep clear.

806
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:28,059
What's that?
A detour?

807
01:17:37,944 --> 01:17:39,654
- Tom! Tom! Please!
- Tom!

808
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:47,036
Just where do you think you're going?

809
01:17:47,871 --> 01:17:49,580
Well...

810
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:55,169
We're strangers here, mister. We heard
there was work in a place called Tovaris.

811
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:57,254
Yeah?
You're heading the wrong way.

812
01:17:57,422 --> 01:18:01,217
What's more, we don't want
no more Okies in this town.

813
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:05,179
There ain't enough work here
for them that's already here.

814
01:18:06,431 --> 01:18:09,684
- Which way's it at, mister?
- You turn right around and head north.

815
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:14,605
And don't you come back
until the cotton's ready. You understand?

816
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:40,840
Pa.
Let's try that other tire.

817
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:46,137
- You got another flat tire, Tom?
- What? Another one?

818
01:18:48,181 --> 01:18:51,976
Pa, get that spare back there?

819
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:14,039
Ma, will you get the hell off there?
This is gonna be heavy enough.

820
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:17,376
Tell you, something's got to happen soon.

821
01:19:17,544 --> 01:19:23,340
We're down to our last day of grease
and two days of flour and 10 potatoes.

822
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:27,678
And Rosasharn, we gotta remember
she's gonna be due soon.

823
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:32,725
- Morning.
- Morning.

824
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:37,438
- You folks looking for work?
- We're looking under boards for work.

825
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:40,191
- Can you pick peaches?
- We can pick anything.

826
01:19:40,358 --> 01:19:44,069
There's plenty of work
about 40 miles up here, this side of Pixley.

827
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:49,033
You turn east on 32, look for the Keene
ranch. Tell them Spencer sent you.

828
01:19:50,076 --> 01:19:53,204
- Mister, we sure thank you.
- Thank you.

829
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:57,833
Come on, Ma.

830
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:20,940
- What is it? A wreck?
- Where do you think you're going?

831
01:20:21,107 --> 01:20:24,235
A fella named Spencer sent us.
Said there was work picking peaches.

832
01:20:24,402 --> 01:20:26,904
- You wanna work?
- Sure do.

833
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:29,824
All right.
Just pull up in line there.

834
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:33,911
- Okay for this one. Take them through.
- What's the matter? What happened?

835
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:37,623
A little trouble up there,
but you'll get through all right.

836
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:46,882
- Go ahead.
- Right there.

837
01:20:54,599 --> 01:20:56,767
What do you think it is?
A washout?

838
01:20:56,935 --> 01:21:01,146
I don't know what these cops
have got to do with it, but I don't like it.

839
01:21:01,314 --> 01:21:05,901
These are our own people too, all of them.
I don't like this.

840
01:21:06,069 --> 01:21:08,654
Get going.
Stay in line.

841
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:12,032
Go ahead.

842
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:18,622
What are you gonna do, scab?

843
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:05,294
Go on.
Hurry up.

844
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:08,714
Come on, come on, come on.

845
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:10,841
Go on up there.

846
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,011
Up the street there.

847
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:19,266
Keep in line, up the street.

848
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:40,287
Hold it, bud.

849
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:46,502
- Wanna work?
- Sure, but what is this?

850
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:50,005
- None of your business. Name?
- Joad.

851
01:22:50,173 --> 01:22:52,424
- How many men?
- Four.

852
01:22:52,592 --> 01:22:55,511
- Women?
- Two.

853
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,554
- Kids?
- Two.

854
01:22:57,722 --> 01:22:59,932
Can you all work?

855
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:03,227
- Sure, I guess so.
- Okay. House 63.

856
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:06,063
Wages, 5 cents a box.
No bruised fruit.

857
01:23:07,107 --> 01:23:09,900
Move along.
You go to work right away.

858
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:38,178
Come on, honey.

859
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:43,517
- Name?
- Joad.

860
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:45,853
Say, what is all this here?

861
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:48,772
- Joad. Not here.
- License?

862
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:51,692
Oklahoma E-L-2-0-4.

863
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,527
Don't check.

864
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:56,780
Now, you look here.
We don't want no trouble with you.

865
01:23:56,948 --> 01:24:00,659
Just do your own work and mind
your business, and you'll be all right.

866
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:07,499
Sure do wanna make you
feel at home here, all right.

867
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:16,258
- We gonna live here, Ma?
- Why, sure.

868
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:20,012
This won't be so bad
once we get her washed out.

869
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:22,056
I liked the tent better.

870
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:25,100
Why, this has got a floor.

871
01:24:25,268 --> 01:24:28,020
It won't leak when it rains.

872
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:32,316
Here.
This might come in handy.

873
01:24:36,988 --> 01:24:39,198
- Name?
- Still Joad.

874
01:24:39,365 --> 01:24:41,158
- How many?
- Six. You all go on.

875
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:44,453
Rosasharn and me will unload the truck.

876
01:25:32,585 --> 01:25:35,712
- Any more of them hamburgers, Ma?
- No, there ain't.

877
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:39,800
- You made a dollar. That's a dollar's worth.
- Dollar's worth? That?

878
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:43,428
They charge extra at that company store
and there ain't no other place.

879
01:25:43,596 --> 01:25:45,889
Well, I ain't full.

880
01:25:46,057 --> 01:25:49,143
Well, tomorrow you'll get in
a full day's work...

881
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:52,980
...and a full day's pay,
and then we'll all have enough.

882
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:57,651
You wouldn't think just reaching up
and picking would get you in the back.

883
01:25:58,611 --> 01:26:02,406
Think I'll walk out and find out
what all that fuss outside the gate was.

884
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:06,660
- Anybody come with me?
- No, I think I'll set a while, then go to bed.

885
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:10,247
Think I'll look around
and see if I can't meet me a girl.

886
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:12,666
- Say, when I was your age...
- Pa!

887
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:17,171
Working on me what all that yelling
was about. Got me all curious.

888
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:19,131
I'll be back in a little while.

889
01:26:21,801 --> 01:26:26,263
Tom. Now, you be careful. Don't you
go sticking your nose in anything.

890
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:28,682
Okay, Ma.
Don't worry.

891
01:26:39,819 --> 01:26:42,321
Where do you think you're going?

892
01:26:42,488 --> 01:26:44,698
I thought I'd take a walk.

893
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:49,036
- Is there any law against that?
- You can just turn around and walk back.

894
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:52,122
- You mean I can't even get out of here?
- Not tonight, you can't.

895
01:26:52,957 --> 01:26:59,171
Do you wanna walk back? Or shall I whistle
up some help and have you taken back?

896
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:03,884
I'll walk back.

897
01:27:50,181 --> 01:27:52,224
- Evening.
- Who are you?

898
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:54,977
- Just going past, that's all.
- Know anybody around here?

899
01:27:55,144 --> 01:27:57,813
No.
Just going past, I tell you.

900
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:04,695
- Casy!
- Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. Hi, boy.

901
01:28:05,571 --> 01:28:09,449
- I thought you was in jail.
- No. They just run me out of town.

902
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:13,203
Come on in.
Tom Joad.

903
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:18,000
- This the fella you been talking about?
- That's him. What are you doing here?

904
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:20,335
Working, picking peaches.

905
01:28:20,503 --> 01:28:24,298
I heard fellas shouting when we come in.
I came to find out what's going on.

906
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:27,259
- What's it all about?
- This here's a strike.

907
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:30,595
Well, 5 cents a box ain't much,
but a fella can eat.

908
01:28:30,763 --> 01:28:35,350
- Five cents? They paying you 5 cents?
- Sure. We made a buck since midday.

909
01:28:35,518 --> 01:28:38,729
Lookie, Tom.
We come here to work.

910
01:28:38,896 --> 01:28:42,649
They tell us it's gonna be 5 cents,
but there's a whole lot of us.

911
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:46,236
So the man says 2 and a half cents.

912
01:28:46,404 --> 01:28:50,407
A fella can't even eat on that
and if he's got kids...

913
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:52,576
So we says we won't take it.

914
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:55,996
So they drive us off.
Now they're paying you 5 cents.

915
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:58,999
But if they bust this strike,
you think they'll pay 5?

916
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:00,792
Don't know.
Paying 5 now.

917
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:04,546
They'll get 2 and a half cents
just the minute we're gone.

918
01:29:04,714 --> 01:29:06,757
You know what that is.

919
01:29:06,924 --> 01:29:10,969
One ton of peaches,
picked and carried for a dollar.

920
01:29:11,137 --> 01:29:14,848
That way you can't even
buy enough food to keep you alive.

921
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:18,977
Tell them to come out with us, Tom.
Them peaches is ripe.

922
01:29:19,145 --> 01:29:23,815
Two days out and they'll pay us all 5,
maybe 7.

923
01:29:25,109 --> 01:29:28,570
They won't. They're getting 5 now.
That's all they care about.

924
01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:32,074
But the moment they ain't strikebreaking,
they won't get no 5.

925
01:29:32,241 --> 01:29:36,244
Next thing you know you'll be out.
They got it all fixed down to a tee.

926
01:29:36,412 --> 01:29:40,207
Well, soon as the harvest is in, you're
a migrant worker. Afterwards, just a bum.

927
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:43,877
Five they're getting now.
That's all they're interested in.

928
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:47,297
I know exactly what Pa would say.
He'd say it's none of his business.

929
01:29:47,465 --> 01:29:50,592
That's right. He'll have to
take a beating before he'll know.

930
01:29:50,968 --> 01:29:53,595
Take a beating?
We was out of food.

931
01:29:53,763 --> 01:29:57,015
Tonight we had meat.
Not much, but we had it.

932
01:29:57,183 --> 01:30:01,603
You think Pa's gonna give up his meat
on account of some other fellas?

933
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:04,022
Rosasharn needs milk.

934
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:08,985
You think Ma's gonna starve that baby just
on account of fellas yelling outside a gate?

935
01:30:09,153 --> 01:30:12,072
Tom, you gotta learn like I'm learning.

936
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:16,243
I don't know what's right yet myself,
but I'm trying to find out.

937
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:19,704
That's why I can't ever be
a preacher again.

938
01:30:19,872 --> 01:30:21,998
Preacher's gotta know.

939
01:30:22,166 --> 01:30:24,584
I don't know.

940
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:26,503
I gotta ask.

941
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:28,755
- I don't like it.
- What's the matter?

942
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:30,465
I can't tell.

943
01:30:30,633 --> 01:30:34,344
Seems as though I hear something and
when I listen, there ain't nothing to hear.

944
01:30:34,512 --> 01:30:37,848
- It ain't out of the question, you know.
- We're all a little itchy.

945
01:30:38,015 --> 01:30:41,017
Cops been telling us how they're
gonna beat us up and run us out.

946
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:46,648
Not them regular deputies, but them
tin-seal men. The ones they got for guards.

947
01:30:46,816 --> 01:30:49,693
They figure I'm the leader
because I talk so much.

948
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:53,363
Turn out the light. Come outside.
There's something here.

949
01:30:59,078 --> 01:31:02,372
- What is it?
- I don't know. Listen.

950
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:05,500
- Can't tell whether you hear it or not.
- You hear it, Tom?

951
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:10,922
I hear it. I think there's some guys
coming this way, a lot of them.

952
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:15,051
- We gotta get out of here.
- Down that way, under the bridge span.

953
01:31:36,282 --> 01:31:39,784
There he is! The one in the middle,
the skinny one. Chuck, Alec, get him!

954
01:31:44,749 --> 01:31:47,792
You don't know what you're doing!
You're helping to starve kids.

955
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:50,420
- Shut up, you dirty...
- Casy!

956
01:31:51,589 --> 01:31:54,758
- You've killed him!
- Serves him right too.

957
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:56,968
Look out!

958
01:32:05,561 --> 01:32:09,314
He's dead. He's good and dead.
Did you see the fella that done it?

959
01:32:09,482 --> 01:32:13,777
I ain't sure, but I caught him across the face,
a trademark he won't get rid of in a hurry.

960
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:30,126
Ma?

961
01:32:30,294 --> 01:32:34,965
Tom! Tom!
Pa, wake up. Al, get the light.

962
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:41,513
Come on.

963
01:33:33,691 --> 01:33:36,151
- Anybody ask anything?
- No, ma'am.

964
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:38,695
- Well, you stay by that door.
- Yes, ma'am.

965
01:33:41,699 --> 01:33:43,575
Tommy?

966
01:33:44,744 --> 01:33:47,287
How's it feel?

967
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:52,250
Busted my cheek, but I can still see.

968
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:57,589
- What'd you hear?
- Looks like you've done it.

969
01:33:59,467 --> 01:34:02,218
I thought so.
Felt like it.

970
01:34:04,138 --> 01:34:06,973
Folks ain't talking about much else.

971
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:09,726
They say they got posses out.

972
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:12,354
Talking about a lynching
when they catch the fella.

973
01:34:13,147 --> 01:34:14,898
They killed Casy first.

974
01:34:15,524 --> 01:34:19,069
That ain't the way they're telling it.
They're saying you done it first.

975
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:23,740
Do they know what the fella looks like?

976
01:34:25,117 --> 01:34:27,994
They know he got hit in the face.

977
01:34:30,581 --> 01:34:32,832
I'm sorry, Ma.

978
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,670
I didn't know what I was doing
any more than when you take a breath.

979
01:34:36,837 --> 01:34:38,963
I didn't even know I was gonna do it.

980
01:34:40,216 --> 01:34:43,343
It's all right, Tommy.

981
01:34:44,929 --> 01:34:47,555
I wished you didn't do it...

982
01:34:47,723 --> 01:34:50,350
...but you done what you had to do...

983
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:53,103
...and I can't read no fault in you.

984
01:34:57,441 --> 01:35:00,235
I'm going away tonight.
I can't go putting this on you folks.

985
01:35:00,403 --> 01:35:02,028
Tom.

986
01:35:02,196 --> 01:35:05,365
There's a whole lot I don't understand.

987
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:08,868
But going away ain't gonna ease us.

988
01:35:10,621 --> 01:35:13,623
There was a time we was on the land.

989
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:16,960
There was a boundary to us then.

990
01:35:17,336 --> 01:35:20,880
Old folks died off and little fellas come.

991
01:35:21,048 --> 01:35:24,008
We was always one thing.

992
01:35:24,176 --> 01:35:26,970
We was the family.

993
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:30,473
Kind of whole and clear.

994
01:35:30,641 --> 01:35:33,560
But now we ain't clear no more.

995
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:36,938
There ain't nothing that keeps us clear.

996
01:35:37,106 --> 01:35:40,817
Al, he's hankering and gibbeting
to be off on his own.

997
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:44,446
Uncle John's just dragging around.

998
01:35:44,822 --> 01:35:48,908
Your pa's lost his place.
He ain't the head no more.

999
01:35:50,494 --> 01:35:53,246
We're cracking up, Tom.

1000
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:57,083
There ain't no family now.

1001
01:36:00,212 --> 01:36:06,009
And Rosasharn, she's gonna have her baby,
but it won't have no family.

1002
01:36:06,177 --> 01:36:09,471
I been trying to keep her going, but...

1003
01:36:11,515 --> 01:36:13,725
And Winfield...

1004
01:36:13,893 --> 01:36:16,478
...what's he gonna be this way?

1005
01:36:16,645 --> 01:36:21,232
Growing up wild.
And Ruthie too.

1006
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:24,068
Just like animals.

1007
01:36:25,905 --> 01:36:29,282
Got nothing to trust.

1008
01:36:31,869 --> 01:36:34,204
Don't go, Tom.

1009
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:37,624
Stay and help.

1010
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:40,585
Help me.

1011
01:36:45,299 --> 01:36:50,220
Okay, Ma. I shouldn't.
I know I shouldn't, but okay.

1012
01:36:53,599 --> 01:36:55,558
Ma, here come a lot of people.

1013
01:36:56,769 --> 01:36:59,020
- How many?
- Ten of us.

1014
01:36:59,188 --> 01:37:01,356
House 25.
The number's on the door.

1015
01:37:01,524 --> 01:37:05,527
- Okay, mister. What you paying?
- Two and a half cents.

1016
01:37:05,694 --> 01:37:09,697
Two and a half? Say, mister,
a man can't make his dinner on that.

1017
01:37:09,865 --> 01:37:11,105
Take it or leave it.

1018
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:14,035
There are 200 men coming in
from the South that'll be glad to get it.

1019
01:37:14,203 --> 01:37:16,913
- But how are we going to eat?
- Look.

1020
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:21,793
I didn't set the price. If you want it, okay.
If you don't, turn around and beat it.

1021
01:37:21,961 --> 01:37:25,922
- Which way to House 25?
- Straight up the street.

1022
01:37:34,598 --> 01:37:36,724
That Casy.

1023
01:37:36,892 --> 01:37:41,187
He might have been a preacher,
but he seen things clear.

1024
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:43,356
He was like a lantern.

1025
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:45,942
He helped me to see things too.

1026
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:49,904
Comes night, we'll get out of here.

1027
01:37:51,115 --> 01:37:53,324
Like a lantern.

1028
01:37:57,663 --> 01:38:00,331
- I'll start the car.
- Yes.

1029
01:38:11,051 --> 01:38:13,219
All right, Tom.

1030
01:38:15,472 --> 01:38:17,640
Jump up.
Jump up.

1031
01:38:21,228 --> 01:38:23,730
Just till we get distance.
Then you can come out.

1032
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:26,441
I'd hate to get trapped in here.

1033
01:38:26,609 --> 01:38:28,651
Get in, Ma.

1034
01:38:30,362 --> 01:38:31,362
Come on, John.

1035
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:34,240
- Hey! Where you going?
- We're going out.

1036
01:38:34,408 --> 01:38:37,410
- What for?
- We got a job offered. A good job.

1037
01:38:37,578 --> 01:38:38,745
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1038
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:41,205
Well, let's take a look at you.

1039
01:38:59,683 --> 01:39:03,061
- Wasn't there another fella with you?
- You mean that hitchhiker?

1040
01:39:03,228 --> 01:39:07,106
- Little short fella with a pale face?
- I guess that's what he looked like.

1041
01:39:07,274 --> 01:39:09,943
We just picked him up on the way in.

1042
01:39:10,110 --> 01:39:13,947
- He left when the rate dropped.
- What did you say he looked like again?

1043
01:39:14,114 --> 01:39:16,366
Short fella, pale face.

1044
01:39:16,533 --> 01:39:18,785
Was he bruised about the face
this morning?

1045
01:39:18,953 --> 01:39:20,995
I didn't see nothing.

1046
01:39:21,163 --> 01:39:23,915
Okay, go on.

1047
01:39:42,726 --> 01:39:48,231
- Going out for good?
- Yeah. Going north. Got a job.

1048
01:39:49,566 --> 01:39:51,401
Okay.

1049
01:40:01,495 --> 01:40:05,373
- You done good, Al. You done real good.
- Know where we're going?

1050
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:07,625
It don't matter.
We gotta go and keep going...

1051
01:40:07,793 --> 01:40:10,837
...till we get plenty of distance
away from here.

1052
01:40:27,813 --> 01:40:30,481
She's... She's hotter than a heifer.

1053
01:40:30,649 --> 01:40:32,233
The fan belt's shot.

1054
01:40:32,401 --> 01:40:35,528
Sure picked a nice place for it too,
didn't she?

1055
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:38,990
- Got any gas?
- About half a gallon.

1056
01:40:39,158 --> 01:40:41,743
Well, Ma, sure looks like
we done her this time.

1057
01:40:41,910 --> 01:40:44,871
Lights up ahead.
That might be a camp or something.

1058
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:47,790
Looks like about a mile.
Reckon she'll coast her, Al?

1059
01:40:48,459 --> 01:40:51,544
- Got to coast it.
- Well, let's give her a whirl?

1060
01:40:51,712 --> 01:40:54,881
Come on, kids. Get in.
John!

1061
01:41:31,335 --> 01:41:33,544
Did you hurt yourself, John?

1062
01:41:33,712 --> 01:41:35,546
No.

1063
01:41:37,007 --> 01:41:40,134
- You hit it too fast.
- What's the idea of that?

1064
01:41:40,302 --> 01:41:43,054
Well, you see, a lot of children
play in here.

1065
01:41:43,222 --> 01:41:46,516
You can tell people to drive slow
and they're liable to forget...

1066
01:41:46,683 --> 01:41:49,018
...but once they hit that hump,
they don't forget.

1067
01:41:49,186 --> 01:41:51,687
- Got any room here for us?
- You're lucky.

1068
01:41:51,855 --> 01:41:54,398
How do you do, ma'am?
How are you?

1069
01:41:54,566 --> 01:41:56,651
How are you?

1070
01:41:56,819 --> 01:41:59,731
Down that line, turn to the left.
You'll see it.

1071
01:41:59,756 --> 01:42:01,456
You'll be in Number 4 sanitary unit.

1072
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:05,952
- What's that?
- Toilet, showers, washtubs.

1073
01:42:07,037 --> 01:42:09,372
You mean we'll have
washtubs with running water?

1074
01:42:09,832 --> 01:42:11,207
Yes, ma'am.
Ha.

1075
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:14,418
Camp committee will call on you
in the morning, get you fixed.

1076
01:42:14,711 --> 01:42:17,755
- Cops?
- No. No cops.

1077
01:42:17,923 --> 01:42:22,301
No, people here elect their own cops.
The ladies' committee'll call on you, ma'am.

1078
01:42:22,469 --> 01:42:25,555
Tell you about the children,
the schools and sanitary unit...

1079
01:42:25,848 --> 01:42:28,057
...and who takes care of them.

1080
01:42:28,225 --> 01:42:30,351
Will you come inside and sign up?

1081
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:43,698
Drive her on down, Al.
I'll sign up.

1082
01:42:45,117 --> 01:42:48,744
Right this way.
In here.

1083
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:59,505
Now, I don't wanna seem inquisitive,
you understand...

1084
01:42:59,673 --> 01:43:05,052
...but there's certain information
I have to have. What's your name?

1085
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:07,638
Joad.
Tom Joad.

1086
01:43:07,806 --> 01:43:10,099
- J-O...
- A-D.

1087
01:43:10,267 --> 01:43:11,934
A-D.

1088
01:43:12,102 --> 01:43:14,478
And how many of you?

1089
01:43:15,314 --> 01:43:17,857
Eight now.

1090
01:43:19,943 --> 01:43:24,363
- Uncle John, you don't look so good.
- I ain't so good, but I'm coming.

1091
01:43:24,531 --> 01:43:26,616
Come on.

1092
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:28,701
Shove.

1093
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:31,495
Campsite costs a dollar a week.
You can work that out...

1094
01:43:31,663 --> 01:43:35,541
...carrying garbage, keeping
the camp clean, things like that.

1095
01:43:35,709 --> 01:43:37,793
We'll work it out.

1096
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:40,630
What's the committee
you're talking about?

1097
01:43:40,797 --> 01:43:45,843
We have five sanitary units.
Each one elects a central committee man.

1098
01:43:46,011 --> 01:43:48,429
They make the laws
and what they say goes.

1099
01:43:48,597 --> 01:43:54,227
You aiming to tell me the fellas running
the camp are just fellas camping here?

1100
01:43:54,394 --> 01:43:57,230
- That's the way it is.
- And you say no cops?

1101
01:43:58,482 --> 01:44:00,483
No cop can come in here
without a warrant.

1102
01:44:01,652 --> 01:44:04,153
I can't hardly believe it.

1103
01:44:04,321 --> 01:44:09,158
Camp I was in before, they burnt it out.
Deputies and some of them poolroom fellas.

1104
01:44:09,326 --> 01:44:13,204
They don't get in here.
Sometimes the boys patrol the fences.

1105
01:44:13,372 --> 01:44:16,999
- Especially on dance nights.
- You got dances too?

1106
01:44:17,167 --> 01:44:20,461
We have the best dances in the county,
every Saturday night.

1107
01:44:20,629 --> 01:44:23,339
- Who runs this place?
- The government.

1108
01:44:23,507 --> 01:44:27,843
- Why ain't there more like it?
- You find out. I can't.

1109
01:44:29,596 --> 01:44:31,973
Is there anything like work around here?

1110
01:44:32,224 --> 01:44:33,724
I can't promise you that...

1111
01:44:33,892 --> 01:44:37,812
...but there'll be a licensed agent here later
if you wanna talk to him.

1112
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:39,689
That cut you have?

1113
01:44:40,774 --> 01:44:43,401
- Crate fell on me.
- You'd better take care of it.

1114
01:44:43,568 --> 01:44:47,363
Store manager will give you
something for it. See you later.

1115
01:44:48,615 --> 01:44:50,908
Ma's sure gonna like it here.

1116
01:44:51,076 --> 01:44:54,161
She ain't been treated decent for...

1117
01:44:54,329 --> 01:44:56,372
...a long while.

1118
01:44:57,916 --> 01:44:59,709
See you later.

1119
01:45:40,751 --> 01:45:44,837
- Winfield. I got something to show you.
- What's the matter?

1120
01:45:45,005 --> 01:45:48,132
It's some white things made out
of dish stuff, like in the catalogs.

1121
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:49,925
Come on, I'll show you.

1122
01:46:02,606 --> 01:46:05,608
Come on.
Ain't nobody gonna say anything.

1123
01:46:11,531 --> 01:46:15,117
There's where you wash your hands.

1124
01:46:15,285 --> 01:46:18,204
- What's these?
- I reckon you stand in them little rooms.

1125
01:46:18,372 --> 01:46:21,957
And water comes down out of that
little jigger up there. You take a bath.

1126
01:46:22,125 --> 01:46:26,087
- Look. Just like in the catalogs.
- Hey! Don't you go monkeying!

1127
01:46:28,131 --> 01:46:29,924
Now you done it!
You busted it!

1128
01:46:31,468 --> 01:46:33,469
All I done was pull that string.

1129
01:46:52,989 --> 01:46:54,532
- Hi, Mr. Thomas.
- Morning.

1130
01:46:54,699 --> 01:46:56,992
- How are you?
- Morning.

1131
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:59,078
Nice job.

1132
01:46:59,246 --> 01:47:04,333
Listen here. Maybe I'm gonna talk myself
out of my farm, but I like you fellas.

1133
01:47:04,501 --> 01:47:06,961
You're good workers
so I'm gonna tell you.

1134
01:47:07,129 --> 01:47:09,713
- You live over in the government camp?
- Yes, sir.

1135
01:47:09,881 --> 01:47:11,841
You have dances there
every Saturday night.

1136
01:47:12,008 --> 01:47:13,217
We sure do.

1137
01:47:13,385 --> 01:47:17,012
- Well, look out next Saturday night.
- What's the matter?

1138
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:19,682
I'm head to the central committee.
I gotta know.

1139
01:47:19,850 --> 01:47:22,476
Well, don't tell I told you.

1140
01:47:23,019 --> 01:47:24,770
Listen.

1141
01:47:25,689 --> 01:47:30,943
"Citizens angered at red agitators
burning other squatters' camps...

1142
01:47:31,111 --> 01:47:33,529
...and order agitators
to leave the county."

1143
01:47:33,697 --> 01:47:36,699
Listen.
What is these reds anyway?

1144
01:47:36,867 --> 01:47:40,578
Every time you turn around,
somebody's calling somebody else a red.

1145
01:47:40,745 --> 01:47:42,288
What is these reds anyway?

1146
01:47:42,456 --> 01:47:45,040
I ain't talking about that,
one way or the other.

1147
01:47:45,208 --> 01:47:48,669
All I'm saying is there's going to be
a fight at the camp Saturday night...

1148
01:47:49,129 --> 01:47:51,338
...and there'll be deputies ready to go in.

1149
01:47:52,466 --> 01:47:54,842
Now go on with your work.

1150
01:47:55,010 --> 01:48:01,307
Maybe I've talked myself into trouble,
but you're folks like us and I like you.

1151
01:48:01,475 --> 01:48:03,684
We won't tell who told.
Thank you.

1152
01:48:03,852 --> 01:48:08,105
- All right.
- There ain't gonna be no fight either.

1153
01:48:22,454 --> 01:48:25,498
- Evening. Who'd you say invited you?
- Mr. And Mrs. Brown.

1154
01:48:25,665 --> 01:48:28,918
Go right on in, folks. Go right on in.
Hello, there. How are you?

1155
01:48:29,085 --> 01:48:31,754
Hi, Mrs. Jennings. How are you?
Glad to see you.

1156
01:48:48,939 --> 01:48:50,814
- Hello.
- Hello.

1157
01:48:50,982 --> 01:48:55,653
- Going to the dance tonight? I can waltz.
- That's nothing. Anybody can waltz.

1158
01:48:55,820 --> 01:48:58,531
- Not like me, they can't.
- You get going!

1159
01:48:58,698 --> 01:49:00,908
This girl's spoke for.
She's gonna be married...

1160
01:49:01,076 --> 01:49:03,536
...and her man's coming for her.
So get!

1161
01:49:10,919 --> 01:49:13,587
Hi, Bill.
Nice-looking girl you got there.

1162
01:49:13,755 --> 01:49:17,049
- Howdy, Mr. Thomas. Howdy, Mrs. Thomas.
- Watching out, ain't you?

1163
01:49:17,217 --> 01:49:18,842
There ain't gonna be no trouble.

1164
01:49:19,010 --> 01:49:21,720
I hope you know
what you're talking about.

1165
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:25,307
Evening, boys.
Who did you say invited you?

1166
01:49:25,892 --> 01:49:29,478
Fella named Jackson.
Buck Jackson.

1167
01:49:29,646 --> 01:49:33,941
- Okay. Have a good time.
- Thanks.

1168
01:49:40,407 --> 01:49:41,949
Hey.

1169
01:49:42,117 --> 01:49:44,618
- Them's our fellas.
- How do you know?

1170
01:49:45,370 --> 01:49:46,954
Well...

1171
01:49:47,122 --> 01:49:49,456
...just got a feeling.

1172
01:49:49,624 --> 01:49:52,334
They're kind of scared too.

1173
01:49:52,502 --> 01:49:56,088
Follow them. Get hold of Jackson,
see if he knows them. I'll stay here.

1174
01:49:59,926 --> 01:50:02,720
- Hello. I...
- Hello.

1175
01:50:02,887 --> 01:50:04,930
So long.

1176
01:50:09,102 --> 01:50:11,437
How do you do, Mrs. Joad?
How do you do?

1177
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:14,607
My, you sure look pretty.

1178
01:50:23,283 --> 01:50:26,368
- Please to dance, ma'am?
- Thank you kindly, but she ain't well.

1179
01:50:26,536 --> 01:50:30,247
- Sort of poorly.
- Well, thank you just the same.

1180
01:50:31,708 --> 01:50:34,084
Howdy do.

1181
01:50:41,134 --> 01:50:42,885
Hey, Jackson.

1182
01:50:43,053 --> 01:50:46,013
Look.
Did you ever see them fellas before?

1183
01:50:51,394 --> 01:50:56,732
Sorry, neighbor, but we got
to keep the camp clean.

1184
01:50:57,484 --> 01:51:01,695
I know one of them. Used to work with him.
I never asked him to the dance though.

1185
01:51:01,863 --> 01:51:06,283
All right. Keep your eye on them.
Just keep them in sight, that's all.

1186
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,628
I seen them. A car with five men
parked down by the eucalyptus trees.

1187
01:51:17,796 --> 01:51:21,590
And another with four men on the main road.
And they got guns, I seen them.

1188
01:51:21,758 --> 01:51:27,221
Thank you, Willy. You done right good.
You can run along and dance now.

1189
01:51:27,389 --> 01:51:30,265
Well, sure looks like
the fat's in the fire this time.

1190
01:51:30,433 --> 01:51:34,228
What them deputies wanna hurt the camp for?
How come they can't let us alone?

1191
01:51:34,396 --> 01:51:39,692
- We ought to get some pickax handles...
- No. That's just what they want.

1192
01:51:39,859 --> 01:51:41,944
No, sirree.
If they can get a fight going...

1193
01:51:42,112 --> 01:51:44,446
...they can call in the cops,
say we ain't orderly.

1194
01:51:44,614 --> 01:51:47,491
- They're here. We got them spotted.
- Got everything ready?

1195
01:51:47,659 --> 01:51:50,744
- There ain't gonna be trouble.
- I don't want you hurting them.

1196
01:51:50,912 --> 01:51:54,331
Don't worry. Everything's arranged.
Maybe nobody will even see it.

1197
01:51:54,499 --> 01:51:59,420
Well, just don't use no sticks
or no knives or no piece of iron.

1198
01:51:59,587 --> 01:52:03,090
If you gotta sock them,
sock them where they ain't gonna bleed.

1199
01:52:17,397 --> 01:52:21,608
Gentlemen, hats off, please.
Thank you.

1200
01:52:37,834 --> 01:52:42,880
- She's getting prettier every day, Ma.
- Girl with a baby's always prettier.

1201
01:53:02,484 --> 01:53:07,196
- Come on, Ma, let's dance.
- Oh, Tom. I can't.

1202
01:53:07,363 --> 01:53:09,448
Well, all right.

1203
01:53:13,703 --> 01:53:16,163
Tom, stop.

1204
01:53:23,129 --> 01:53:28,091
Come and sit by my side if you love me

1205
01:53:28,259 --> 01:53:33,138
Do not hasten to bid me adieu

1206
01:53:33,306 --> 01:53:38,143
But remember the Red River Valley

1207
01:53:38,311 --> 01:53:43,232
And the boy who had loved you so true

1208
01:53:54,828 --> 01:53:56,912
Nine-twenty-nine.
Let's go!

1209
01:54:02,919 --> 01:54:05,879
All right, 9:30.
Here we go.

1210
01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:13,053
- All right. I'll dance with her.
- You and who else?

1211
01:54:13,513 --> 01:54:14,930
Excuse me, Ma.

1212
01:54:23,606 --> 01:54:25,691
Open up!
We're here about a riot!

1213
01:54:25,859 --> 01:54:30,070
- Riot? I don't see any riot. Who are you?
- Deputy sheriffs.

1214
01:54:30,238 --> 01:54:33,490
- Have you got a warrant?
- We don't need a warrant when there's a riot.

1215
01:54:33,658 --> 01:54:37,494
I don't know what you're gonna do about it.
I don't hear or see any riot.

1216
01:54:37,662 --> 01:54:40,455
What's more, I don't believe
there is any riot. Look for yourself.

1217
01:54:54,053 --> 01:54:56,138
All right, let's go.

1218
01:55:49,192 --> 01:55:54,071
Oklahoma.
E-L-2-0-4.

1219
01:56:35,321 --> 01:56:37,864
You have no right
to arrest anybody without a warrant.

1220
01:56:38,032 --> 01:56:41,827
We'll have a warrant just as soon
as we check with headquarters.

1221
01:58:07,246 --> 01:58:09,456
Tommy.

1222
01:58:09,624 --> 01:58:11,833
Ain't you gonna tell me goodbye?

1223
01:58:19,592 --> 01:58:21,885
I didn't know, Ma.

1224
01:58:22,053 --> 01:58:23,845
I didn't know if I ought to.

1225
01:58:24,013 --> 01:58:28,183
- Ma...
- Hush, Ruthie.

1226
01:58:29,894 --> 01:58:32,229
Come outside.

1227
01:59:08,808 --> 01:59:13,061
There was some cops here tonight.
They was taking down license numbers.

1228
01:59:13,229 --> 01:59:15,438
I guess somebody knows something.

1229
01:59:15,606 --> 01:59:19,943
I guess it had to come sooner or later.

1230
01:59:56,355 --> 01:59:58,857
Sit down for a minute.

1231
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:02,611
I'd like to stay, Ma.

1232
02:00:04,113 --> 02:00:06,239
I'd like to be with you
and see your face...

1233
02:00:06,407 --> 02:00:09,993
...when you and Pa
get settled in some nice place.

1234
02:00:10,161 --> 02:00:13,330
I'd sure like to see you then.

1235
02:00:14,457 --> 02:00:17,959
But I won't never get that chance,
I guess, now.

1236
02:00:18,711 --> 02:00:22,881
- I could hide you, Tommy.
- I know you would, but I ain't gonna let you.

1237
02:00:23,049 --> 02:00:28,053
You hide somebody that's killed a guy
and you're in trouble too.

1238
02:00:28,221 --> 02:00:30,472
All right, Tommy.

1239
02:00:30,973 --> 02:00:32,933
But what do you figure you're gonna do?

1240
02:00:34,769 --> 02:00:37,729
You know what I've been thinking about?

1241
02:00:37,897 --> 02:00:40,148
About Casy.

1242
02:00:40,316 --> 02:00:42,692
About what he said...

1243
02:00:42,860 --> 02:00:45,153
...what he done...

1244
02:00:45,321 --> 02:00:47,822
...about how he died.

1245
02:00:48,407 --> 02:00:50,367
And I remember all of it.

1246
02:00:52,828 --> 02:00:55,372
He was a good man.

1247
02:00:55,539 --> 02:00:57,874
I've been thinking about us too.

1248
02:00:58,417 --> 02:01:01,670
About our people living like pigs...

1249
02:01:01,837 --> 02:01:05,340
...and good, rich land laying fallow.

1250
02:01:05,925 --> 02:01:11,179
Or maybe one guy with a million acres
and 100,000 farmers starving.

1251
02:01:12,056 --> 02:01:14,599
And I've been wondering if...

1252
02:01:14,767 --> 02:01:17,185
...all our folks got together and yelled...

1253
02:01:17,353 --> 02:01:19,521
Tommy.
They'd drive you out and cut you down...

1254
02:01:19,689 --> 02:01:23,149
...just like they done to Casy.
They're gonna drive me anyways.

1255
02:01:23,317 --> 02:01:27,696
Sooner or later they'd get me,
for one thing if not for another.

1256
02:01:27,863 --> 02:01:29,614
Until then...

1257
02:01:30,032 --> 02:01:31,533
Tommy.

1258
02:01:31,701 --> 02:01:36,037
- You're not aiming to kill nobody?
- No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it.

1259
02:01:36,205 --> 02:01:38,206
It's just...

1260
02:01:38,374 --> 02:01:42,502
Well, as long as I'm an outlaw anyways,
maybe I can do something.

1261
02:01:42,670 --> 02:01:45,297
Maybe I can just find out something.

1262
02:01:45,464 --> 02:01:50,885
Just scrounge around
and maybe find out what it is that's wrong.

1263
02:01:52,054 --> 02:01:55,473
Then see if there ain't something
that can be done about it.

1264
02:01:57,560 --> 02:02:00,979
I ain't thought it all out clear, Ma.
I...

1265
02:02:01,147 --> 02:02:03,898
I can't.
I don't know enough.

1266
02:02:04,650 --> 02:02:06,693
How am I gonna know about you, Tommy?

1267
02:02:07,570 --> 02:02:10,071
Why, they could kill you
and I'd never know.

1268
02:02:10,239 --> 02:02:13,074
They could hurt you.
How am I gonna know?

1269
02:02:15,328 --> 02:02:20,123
Well, maybe it's like Casy says.

1270
02:02:20,333 --> 02:02:23,835
Fella ain't got a soul of his own,
just...

1271
02:02:24,003 --> 02:02:26,004
...a little piece of a big soul.

1272
02:02:26,172 --> 02:02:29,591
The one big soul
that belongs to everybody.

1273
02:02:30,551 --> 02:02:32,427
Then...

1274
02:02:32,595 --> 02:02:36,306
- Then what, Tom?
- Then it don't matter.

1275
02:02:36,557 --> 02:02:39,559
I'll be all around in the dark.

1276
02:02:39,727 --> 02:02:41,519
I'll be everywhere...

1277
02:02:41,687 --> 02:02:44,105
...wherever you can look.

1278
02:02:44,940 --> 02:02:50,904
Wherever there's a fight
so hungry people can eat, I'll be there.

1279
02:02:51,197 --> 02:02:56,534
Wherever there's a cop beating up a guy,
I'll be there.

1280
02:02:57,328 --> 02:02:59,829
I'll be in the way guys yell
when they're mad.

1281
02:03:01,540 --> 02:03:07,295
I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're
hungry and they know supper's ready.

1282
02:03:08,172 --> 02:03:12,926
And when the people
are eating the stuff they raise...

1283
02:03:13,344 --> 02:03:16,346
...and living in the houses they build...

1284
02:03:16,847 --> 02:03:19,140
...I'll be there too.

1285
02:03:22,812 --> 02:03:25,230
I don't understand it, Tom.

1286
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:29,275
Me neither, Ma, but...

1287
02:03:29,735 --> 02:03:32,195
...it's just something
I've been thinking about.

1288
02:03:33,989 --> 02:03:35,865
Give me your hand, Ma.

1289
02:03:38,452 --> 02:03:39,994
Goodbye.

1290
02:03:40,162 --> 02:03:42,288
Goodbye, Tommy.

1291
02:03:42,456 --> 02:03:45,667
Later, when this is blowed over...

1292
02:03:45,835 --> 02:03:47,919
...you'll come back?

1293
02:03:48,087 --> 02:03:50,171
Sure, Ma.

1294
02:03:51,173 --> 02:03:55,343
Tom, we ain't the kissing kind, but...

1295
02:04:02,476 --> 02:04:04,519
Goodbye, Ma.

1296
02:04:05,146 --> 02:04:07,355
Goodbye, Tommy.

1297
02:04:15,406 --> 02:04:17,490
Tommy.

1298
02:04:56,280 --> 02:04:58,072
Goodbye.

1299
02:05:02,578 --> 02:05:04,913
Turn that up, Al, and get her rolled up.

1300
02:05:05,080 --> 02:05:07,040
- How you fixed, John?
- Getting along.

1301
02:05:07,208 --> 02:05:08,917
Here.

1302
02:05:10,085 --> 02:05:12,045
Winfield, get on top, out of the way.

1303
02:05:12,213 --> 02:05:14,422
I don't see what you folks
are hurrying so for.

1304
02:05:14,590 --> 02:05:16,633
They tell me there's 20 days' work
up there.

1305
02:05:17,092 --> 02:05:19,594
Yes, sir, and we aim to get in
all 20 of them.

1306
02:05:19,762 --> 02:05:23,097
- All ready, Ma?
- Yes. How you feeling, Rosasharn?

1307
02:05:23,265 --> 02:05:26,726
All aboard, everybody.
All aboard for Fresno.

1308
02:05:26,894 --> 02:05:29,395
Wait a minute.
I'll give you a hand.

1309
02:05:29,563 --> 02:05:32,690
- Careful of her, now.
- Easy, child.

1310
02:05:37,947 --> 02:05:40,031
She'll be all right.

1311
02:05:43,619 --> 02:05:47,080
- Watch her, John.
- I'll take care of her.

1312
02:05:48,457 --> 02:05:51,793
- How are you fixed, Al?
- All right, Pa.

1313
02:05:55,548 --> 02:05:57,465
Now, Ma...

1314
02:06:03,305 --> 02:06:04,806
Goodbye.

1315
02:06:05,224 --> 02:06:07,600
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

1316
02:06:10,020 --> 02:06:13,064
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.

1317
02:06:13,899 --> 02:06:16,651
- Thanks a lot. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1318
02:06:16,819 --> 02:06:19,529
Thanks, Mr. Conway.

1319
02:06:21,824 --> 02:06:23,264
- Bye.
- Be careful.

1320
02:06:23,409 --> 02:06:24,909
Goodbye.

1321
02:06:43,554 --> 02:06:46,431
Twenty days' work.
Oh, boy!

1322
02:06:46,599 --> 02:06:51,436
I'll be glad to get my hands on some cotton.
That's the kind of picking I understand.

1323
02:06:51,604 --> 02:06:56,274
Maybe. Maybe 20 days' work
and maybe no days' work.

1324
02:06:56,442 --> 02:07:00,194
- We ain't got it till we get it.
- What's the matter, Ma? Getting scared?

1325
02:07:00,613 --> 02:07:02,322
Scared.
Ha!

1326
02:07:02,489 --> 02:07:05,199
I ain't never gonna be scared no more.

1327
02:07:05,367 --> 02:07:11,164
I was though. For a while, it looked
as though we was beat. Good and beat.

1328
02:07:11,332 --> 02:07:14,584
Looked like we didn't have nobody
in the whole wide world but enemies.

1329
02:07:14,752 --> 02:07:17,629
Like nobody was friendly no more.

1330
02:07:17,796 --> 02:07:21,257
Made me feel kind of bad and scared too.

1331
02:07:21,425 --> 02:07:24,636
Like we was lost and nobody cared.

1332
02:07:26,055 --> 02:07:29,057
You're the one that keeps us going, Ma.

1333
02:07:29,224 --> 02:07:32,143
I ain't no good no more and I know it.

1334
02:07:32,311 --> 02:07:37,148
Seems like I spend all my time these days
thinking how it used to be.

1335
02:07:37,316 --> 02:07:39,525
Thinking of home.

1336
02:07:40,152 --> 02:07:42,403
I ain't never gonna see it no more.

1337
02:07:42,571 --> 02:07:47,241
Well, Pa, a woman can change
better than a man.

1338
02:07:47,409 --> 02:07:51,704
A man lives sort of, well, in jerks.

1339
02:07:51,872 --> 02:07:54,457
Baby's born or somebody dies,
and that's a jerk.

1340
02:07:54,625 --> 02:07:58,461
He gets a farm or loses it,
and that's a jerk.

1341
02:07:58,629 --> 02:08:02,173
With a woman, it's all in one flow
like a stream.

1342
02:08:02,341 --> 02:08:08,346
Little eddies and waterfalls,
but the river, it goes right on.

1343
02:08:08,514 --> 02:08:11,599
A woman looks at it that way.

1344
02:08:13,936 --> 02:08:17,105
Maybe, but we're sure taking a beating.

1345
02:08:17,272 --> 02:08:18,773
I know.

1346
02:08:18,941 --> 02:08:21,234
That's what makes us tough.

1347
02:08:21,402 --> 02:08:23,861
Rich fellas come up and they die...

1348
02:08:24,029 --> 02:08:26,489
...and their kids ain't no good,
and they die out.

1349
02:08:26,657 --> 02:08:30,576
But we keep coming.
We're the people that live.

1350
02:08:30,744 --> 02:08:33,955
They can't wipe us out.
They can't lick us.

1351
02:08:34,123 --> 02:08:39,085
We'll go on forever, Pa,
because we're the people.

1352
02:08:40,305 --> 02:09:40,298

00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:31,666
- That what you want?
- I want my police force to obey the law!

481
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,166
There are no laws on this drug!

482
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,041
They don't exist officially,
'cause every time we try to deal with it,

483
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:38,416
some guys in suits show up
and tell us to stop.

484
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:41,958
Look, I don't know who those two were
that came in today

485
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:43,250
and cut you off at the knees.

486
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:45,583
I don't know
if they're feds or military or what,

487
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:48,541
but clearly,
they have you under their thumb.

488
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:50,958
And I don't think you like it.

489
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,750
'Cause they don't care
about the people of this city.

Not like you do, not like I do,

we were counting on guys in suits

to look out for New Orleans.

Now, you need to make me the bad guy,
that's fine.

494
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:07,625
But I'd be willing to bet
you know more than you're allowed to say.

495
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,250
Maybe we can work together on this,
unofficially.

496
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,083
And maybe we can do some good.

that leads us to... where to, huh?

You know, on the streets,

they're talking about
how it'll give you superpowers,

how one hit could kill you.

01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,083
Power to create chaos.

1117
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:15,500
Power to renegotiate your reality.

1118
01:01:15,583 --> 01:01:17,500
One day, you won't even need a pill.

1119
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:19,333
Pretty words.

1120
01:01:20,375 --> 01:01:21,666
Be more specific.

01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:22,666
[whirring]

1122
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:27,583
Sure. Let me tell you
about my friend the little lizard.

1123
01:01:29,166 --> 01:01:33,458
A healer who can stitch himself up
and even regrow what he lost.

1124
01:01:33,541 --> 01:01:38,083
Hands, feet, eyes,
unfathomably complex structures.

1125
01:01:38,791 --> 01:01:42,833
The octopus camouflages herself
against the sea floor.

1126
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:47,083
The wolverine frog breaks its own bones
to use as weapons.

1127
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:50,208
They see in the dark,
they dislocate their bones.

1128
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:52,041
They turn water into plasma.

1129
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:55,916
They punch, they strangle,
they thermoregulate.

1130
01:01:56,458 --> 01:02:00,333
Evolution has given animals
countless abilities we can only dream of.

1131
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:03,166
So much power, <i>por favor.</i>

1132
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:05,958
All the genetic potential
hidden in our DNA

1133
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:07,916
just waiting to be released.

[whirring]

1135
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:10,458
With your investment,

1136
01:02:10,541 --> 01:02:12,791
one day, a pill that lasts forever.

1137
01:02:14,625 --> 01:02:15,875
Stop wishing.

1138
01:02:15,958 --> 01:02:17,166
Start doing.

1139
01:02:18,666 --> 01:02:21,208
Find your power.

Results may vary.

1143
01:02:30,416 --> 01:02:33,875
But as we work to a compound
that we fully control,

1144
01:02:35,083 --> 01:02:36,000
we have the tank.

[car horn blaring]

What you doing here?

1149
01:02:44,333 --> 01:02:46,000
Looking for you. Your mom is worried sick.

1150
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:48,416
- Is she okay?
- Yes, she's okay.

1151
01:02:49,416 --> 01:02:50,250
Where's he?

1152
01:02:52,041 --> 01:02:52,958
I don't know.

1153
01:02:53,791 --> 01:02:55,208
Listen, don't bullshit me right now.

1154
01:02:55,291 --> 01:02:57,000
- I'm not.
- Are you protecting him?

1155
01:02:57,083 --> 01:02:58,416
- No.
- Why are you protecting...

1156
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,625
This is a bad guy.

1157
01:03:00,083 --> 01:03:02,666
Why is he a bad guy?
Because he's done some bad things?

1158
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:04,458
What about you? You do bad things too!

1159
01:03:04,541 --> 01:03:07,666
That is almost a good point,
but the bad things that I have done...

1160
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,416
He's just looking for his daughter.

1161
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,833
Everything he's doing,
he's doing it for her.

1162
01:03:11,916 --> 01:03:14,375
- That sound like a bad guy to you?
- That's what he told you?

1163
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,166
That's what I know.

1164
01:03:19,916 --> 01:03:21,541
Look, I'm sorry that you miss your dad,

1165
01:03:21,625 --> 01:03:23,750
- but he's telling you a story...
- Don't do me like that...

1166
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:26,208
He's not here looking for his daughter.
He's setting up shop.

1167
01:03:26,708 --> 01:03:28,583
- You think he's the source of Power?
- Yes!

1168
01:03:28,666 --> 01:03:30,541
Well, he's not. He's trying to stop it.

1169
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:33,583
Uh-huh. Okay. If that's true,
and by the way, I don't think it is,

1170
01:03:33,666 --> 01:03:35,458
but if it is,
then he should be helping me.

1171
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:38,208
If it's not true, then he's lying to you
and he's dangerous

1172
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:41,541
and I need to bring him in. Either way,
you should tell me where he is.

- [man] Don't worry.

1175

This tank is completely safe.

You're about to witness a very rare power.

Thermoregulation.

This one can get a bit intense.

Is she on the boat?
Tell me where my daughter is!

- [Frank] NOPD, drop your weapon!
- Oh. God!

01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:22,625
- Help me!
- [Art] Shut up.

1277
01:09:22,708 --> 01:09:24,916
- Put the gun down, now!
- I can't do that, chief.

1278

I am not asking!

[gun clatters]

All right, gun down, hands up.
Boss, you running everything.

1281
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:34,500
- Just know I got a little hitch here.
- I don't care!

1282
01:09:34,583 --> 01:09:36,416
I understand you don't care,
but I gotta care.

1283
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,541
I'm just letting you know I'm complying,
okay?

1284
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:41,708
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used...

1285

- [Frank grunts] Ah!
- [gun clicks]

- [Frank] Wait.
- [Art] What now?

1287
01:09:44,416 --> 01:09:45,333
[Frank] Robin!

1288
01:09:45,416 --> 01:09:47,125
Robin told me to tell you something.

1289
01:09:47,208 --> 01:09:50,125
She said every moment
comes with invisible decisions.

1290
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:52,875
She told me to tell you about mine rats
and seismographs...

1291
01:09:52,958 --> 01:09:54,833
Man it was long.
It was about decisions,

1292
01:09:54,916 --> 01:09:56,875
but in the end she said, "Am I lying?"

- [Robin] Frank, we gotta help him.
- [Frank] You already did help him.

1314
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:21,166
You brought him here.
Are you not paying attention?

1315
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:22,250
He's using you.

1316
01:11:22,333 --> 01:11:23,333
What, and you don't?

1317
01:11:23,708 --> 01:11:25,833
At least he's being honest about it.

1318
01:11:25,916 --> 01:11:28,083
Come on. Art, tell him what you told me.

Go home.

1320

- No, come on, please, you can't give up.
- I said...

01:11:32,833 --> 01:11:34,500
- go home.
- You cannot give up!

Uh-huh. Let me guess, you're one
of the good drug dealers, right?

You're trying to save the world.

They have my daughter.

I don't know, man.

You're the one in handcuffs,

01:13:06,166 --> 01:13:07,333
so what am I missing?

1347
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,458
What you're missing is

1348
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:12,333
in the next 30 seconds,
your captain is gonna call you

1349

and tell you to take me
to a different place, not the precinct.

[railway crossing dinging]

But we're never gonna make it

1352
01:13:19,958 --> 01:13:21,083
[Frank] Oh yeah? Why is that?

1353
01:13:22,583 --> 01:13:24,041
Think about what you've seen.

1355

Local authorities on payroll.

Why?

1358
01:13:32,916 --> 01:13:35,583
And then your captain
sends out a single cop

1359
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:39,333
to apprehend the most dangerous man
in the city. Why?

Because he's taking orders
from someone else.

01:14:05,375 --> 01:14:07,708
And I can also tell you
that that van over there...

01:14:10,583 --> 01:14:12,000
ain't delivering newspapers.

This what's gonna happen.

They gonna kill you,
and then they gonna take me.

1367
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:19,541
Now, I'm okay
with that second part of this

1368
01:14:19,625 --> 01:14:21,833
if it gets me to my daughter sooner.

- What are they doing here?
- Doing field testing.

1370
01:14:24,375 --> 01:14:27,125
If they can stabilize it,
then they'll mass produce it.

1371
01:14:27,875 --> 01:14:31,583
So whatever's happening here
is gonna start happening everywhere.

And what?
Your kid has something to do with it?

no one's gonna fight them on it?

So you let 'em take him?

No, it was his plan. It's the only way

01:17:30,291 --> 01:17:32,708
to send the bag man home empty-handed,

1429
01:17:32,791 --> 01:17:34,375
make the boss get out of bed,

1430
01:17:34,458 --> 01:17:37,083
start raining hellfire
on whoever's responsible?

1431
01:17:37,166 --> 01:17:41,250
Or am I gonna be the guy
who makes a good decision

1432
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:43,833
and get the hell out of the goddamn way,

1433
01:17:43,916 --> 01:17:46,708
so we can all get home
in time to watch the Saints highlights?

[Robin] <i>Yeah, Frank!</i>

1435
01:17:49,458 --> 01:17:50,666
So what's it gonna be...

1436
01:17:52,458 --> 01:17:53,291
punk?

1437

I'm the punk?

Where's Tracy?

1443
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,833
I'm just here for Tracy.

1444
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:25,625
She's safe.

1445
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:28,625
Come with me.

01:18:46,958 --> 01:18:49,083
[woman] I know you think
what we're doing here is wrong,

1452
01:18:49,166 --> 01:18:51,958
but do you know the name Henrietta Lacks?

1453
01:18:52,666 --> 01:18:56,458
Henrietta Lacks checks into a hospital
in 1951

1454
01:18:56,541 --> 01:18:58,916
to have a tumor removed from her cervix,

1455
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:01,416
but the doctor
doesn't just take the tumor,

1456
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:04,083
he also takes healthy cells
in the process.

[Robin] <i>Frank. Wait, can you hear me?</i>

<i>Frank?</i>

1459
01:19:08,625 --> 01:19:09,791
[Frank] Hello there.

- [thudding]

1461

[woman]
Those cells, stolen without her consent,

1462
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:17,541
are the backbone
of nearly every medical advancement

1463
01:19:17,625 --> 01:19:18,666
in the last century.

1464
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:22,166
All because someone took one look
at that woman

1465
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:23,833
and saw her true potential.

1466
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:26,500
Tracy's lab results are fascinating.

1467
01:19:26,583 --> 01:19:30,833
We're talking about permanent power,
the next step in human evolution.

All of our greatest advancements
began in darkness, Major.

1470
01:19:42,166 --> 01:19:44,375
It's up to the pioneers to light the way.

1471
01:19:48,875 --> 01:19:50,750
[Art] Well, you see,
that's the thing, Doc.

1472
01:19:51,125 --> 01:19:52,333
You not a pioneer.

1473
01:19:53,583 --> 01:19:54,708
You a drug dealer.

1474
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:57,625
How about you take your science project

1475

No, you're supposed to be the lookout.

Well, you got shot.

1484

[Frank] Yeah, I know.

So what, you bulletproof?

Okay, so see here?

All the checkpoints
got their own security doors.

And if I press those two buttons,
the whole thing go on lockdown mode.

Yeah, that's like County.

1503
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:33,666
So you're saying
you can open and close doors for me.

1504
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:34,833
I mean, I think so.

- I'm going after Art.

You get in any trouble, you run.
You meet me at the front of the ship.

If I can get there, I will.
If I can't, then you keep running.

But you know I'm awesome, right?

Well, go be awesome then.

1512

01:25:20,291 --> 01:25:21,208
<i>Give me an update.</i>

1587
01:25:22,416 --> 01:25:23,291
Room's empty.

1588
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:25,583
She took the escape hatch.

1589
01:25:25,666 --> 01:25:26,625
<i>She could be anywhere.</i>

1590
01:25:26,708 --> 01:25:28,166
[woman] <i>You get back to the Major.</i>

1591
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:29,208
<i>We are ending this.</i>

1592
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:31,041
<i>Somebody find that kid.</i>

1593
01:25:31,458 --> 01:25:32,500
We gotta move.

1594
01:25:32,583 --> 01:25:33,458
You got this?

1595
01:25:34,666 --> 01:25:35,958
[man chuckles]

1596
01:25:37,416 --> 01:25:38,500
[woman] You. With me.

1597
01:25:42,541 --> 01:25:44,916
[high-pitched whirring]

1598
01:25:45,541 --> 01:25:46,416
[watch beeps]

1599
01:25:47,833 --> 01:25:48,708
[gun clicks]

1600
01:25:49,291 --> 01:25:51,125
- [alarm ringing]
- [man] <i>The ship is ready.</i>

1601
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:53,041
Well, then get us out to sea.

1602
01:26:05,666 --> 01:26:08,750
[distant alarm blaring]

1603
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:31,833
[beeping]

1604
01:26:31,916 --> 01:26:33,583
[Art] Let me ask you something, big man.

1605
01:26:36,208 --> 01:26:38,500
What's the most powerful animal
on the planet?

1606
01:26:39,583 --> 01:26:40,541
Shut up.

1607
01:26:40,625 --> 01:26:43,583
[Art] Some people think it's the lion
'cause, you know, they big,

1608
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:44,875
but it's actually the...

1609
01:26:46,625 --> 01:26:47,625
the pistol shrimp.

1610
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:50,208
Little bitty guy, look harmless,

1611
01:26:50,958 --> 01:26:54,833
but hit you so fast,
it vaporizes the water around it.

1612
01:26:55,875 --> 01:26:59,791
Eight thousand degrees hotter
than the surface of the sun.

1613
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:02,833
The shock waves,

1614
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:06,500
rips the flesh right off the bone.

1615
01:27:07,375 --> 01:27:08,583
And when it's all over,

1616
01:27:09,958 --> 01:27:14,041
it's just Mr. Shrimp
sitting there, eating...

1617
01:27:15,375 --> 01:27:16,583
anything that's left.

1618
01:27:18,125 --> 01:27:19,958
Yeah, so?

1619
01:27:21,041 --> 01:27:21,875
So...

1620
01:27:23,875 --> 01:27:25,916
We get all these powers from animals,
right?

1621
01:27:27,041 --> 01:27:28,333
Guess what animal I got?

1622
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:37,375
[distant alarm blaring]

1623
01:27:46,583 --> 01:27:47,916
You made the right choice.

1624
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:48,958
Smart man.

1625
01:27:49,333 --> 01:27:51,250
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1626
01:27:52,083 --> 01:27:53,375
Get the fuck out of here!

1627
01:27:55,791 --> 01:27:57,208
Gotta be honest,

1628
01:27:57,291 --> 01:27:59,833
I was a little disappointed
we took you without a fight.

1629
01:27:59,916 --> 01:28:01,708
Got a lot of dead friends because of you.

1630
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:11,750
[man screams]

1631
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:16,791
Let's go.

1632
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:20,666
- Something funny?
- [cocks gun]

1633
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:21,708
Don't move!

1634
01:28:23,333 --> 01:28:24,250
[grunting]

1635
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:27,375
- [gun fires]
- [man grunts]

1636
01:28:30,958 --> 01:28:31,958
Took you long enough.

1637
01:28:32,333 --> 01:28:33,541
Yeah, you're welcome.

1638
01:28:34,125 --> 01:28:35,958
That's disgusting, by the way. Come on.

1639
01:28:38,083 --> 01:28:39,250
[beeping rapidly]

1640
01:28:39,333 --> 01:28:40,416
[beeps twice]

1641
01:28:47,041 --> 01:28:47,958
[beeping]

1642
01:29:06,166 --> 01:29:07,000
Tracy?

1643
01:29:11,291 --> 01:29:12,125
I'm Robin.

1644
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:16,250
I gotta get you out of here.

1645
01:29:17,625 --> 01:29:18,625
I'm with your dad.

1646
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:20,416
I gotta bring you to him.

1647
01:29:22,416 --> 01:29:23,375
He's here.

1648
01:29:25,208 --> 01:29:26,041
Really?

1649
01:29:28,666 --> 01:29:29,500
He came?

1650
01:29:32,208 --> 01:29:33,208
I knew he'd come.

1651
01:29:36,291 --> 01:29:38,416
- [loud knock]
- [distant alarm ringing]

1652
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,416
[woman]
All right, I'm gonna check the other room.

1653
01:29:48,958 --> 01:29:49,791
No!

1654
01:29:49,875 --> 01:29:51,583
I want you on the deck now.
It's the only way

1655
01:29:51,666 --> 01:29:53,625
- she can get off this damn ship.
- [man] Yes, ma'am.

1656
01:30:01,833 --> 01:30:03,041
[alarm ringing]

<i>The asset is missing. Multiple intruders.
I want a full sweep of the ship.</i>

1659
01:30:12,916 --> 01:30:14,166
[Robin] We gotta keep moving.

1660
01:30:20,458 --> 01:30:22,916
- [Art] Was that Robin I heard?
- Yeah, she's in the control room.

1661
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,333
I think she knows where Tracy is.

1662
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:26,583
Hatch 16.

1663
01:30:27,458 --> 01:30:29,541
Robin, hatch 16.

[Art grunts]

1665
01:30:32,708 --> 01:30:34,458
All right, we gotta get to the bow.

1666
01:30:42,125 --> 01:30:43,208
- [Art] Tracy?
- [Frank] Robin?

1667
01:30:43,291 --> 01:30:44,625
[Art] Where is she? Tracy?

1668
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:47,125
What's going on?

1669
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:49,583
I told her anything goes wrong,
meet at the front of the boat.

1670
01:30:58,500 --> 01:30:59,333
Tracy.

1671
01:31:07,625 --> 01:31:08,875
[Tracy] I missed you so much.

[Tracy and Art crying]

We gotta go.

1675

You okay?

1676
01:31:28,333 --> 01:31:30,250
Let's get you out of here. Come on.

1677
01:31:42,708 --> 01:31:43,791
How much time we got left?

1678
01:31:43,875 --> 01:31:45,458
Less than five, more than zero.

1679
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,875
- Still got your pill?
- Yeah, I'm saving that one.

1680
01:31:49,083 --> 01:31:50,250
Saving it for what?

1681
01:31:50,541 --> 01:31:51,750
Last resort.

1682
01:32:26,125 --> 01:32:26,958

[grunting continues]

[Robin] Yes!

1705
01:33:49,333 --> 01:33:50,541

[Robin] Get off of me!

- [Art] It's not gonna work on you.

1723
01:34:38,791 --> 01:34:40,333
- It's got to be me.
- No, Daddy.

1724
01:34:40,416 --> 01:34:43,458
- You know what'll happen if you do that.
- I will kill her, Arthur, right now,

right in front of you.

I love you more
than anything in the world, you hear me?

1727
01:34:48,291 --> 01:34:51,125
I love you, but there's no way
we're leaving her behind.

All of you out of the boat, now!

[screaming]

1730

Look, if anything goes wrong,

1731
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,916
you drop this boat down
and get out of here, okay?

1732
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
All right.

1733
01:35:01,708 --> 01:35:02,666
I'm gonna end this.

[whispers] Wait.

1741
01:36:01,375 --> 01:36:03,458
- Robin, you all right?
- Don't talk to her!

1742
01:36:03,541 --> 01:36:05,375
[Art] Let me tell you something, Robin.

1743
01:36:05,458 --> 01:36:06,666
You did a great job.

1744
01:36:06,750 --> 01:36:08,208
You saved my daughter's life.

1745
01:36:09,083 --> 01:36:10,625
Now you listen up, Doc!

1746
01:36:11,041 --> 01:36:12,291
You got one chance.

1747

You let her go, I let you live.

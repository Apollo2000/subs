1
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,100
Come on.

2
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,844
Hush.

3
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:30,926
It can at the same time
be both a particle and a wave,

4
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:36,352
depending on the measuring
apparatus we use.

5
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,191
<i>- Hi, Mum.
- Hi.</i>

6
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:54,946
<i>- Hey, is anything wrong?
- No, I'm just at home, reading.</i>

7
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:58,415
<i>I see. We've been trying to call you.</i>

8
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,536
Yes, I know, but I was at a lecture.

9
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,584
<i>Oh? What lecture?</i>

10
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,295
<i>Biology started today. I meant
to call you back, but I was too busy.</i>

11
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,638
Isn't that in the morning?

12
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,597
<i>- What do you mean?
- I thought that was at eight.</i>

13
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,595
- It's Tuesday morning, right?
- Yes.

14
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:24,359
Daddy showed me how
to keep track of everything online.

15
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:29,231
<i>- Well, it was moved to six just this week.
- OK.</i>

16
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:33,117
But, hey, I'm cooking dinner, so...

17
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,953
What are you making?

18
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:40,542
<i>- Just some pasta and stuff.
- OK. Right.</i>

19
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:46,331
<i>- But we can talk later.
- How about tomorrow?</i>

20
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,924
<i>- Sure.
- Yes.</i>

21
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,796
<i>- OK. We love you.
- Love you too.</i>

22
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:56,425
<i>- OK. Bye.
- Bye.</i>

23
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,401
Hello?

24
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,730
Hello? Hey!

25
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,743
Can someone call an ambulance?

26
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,377
Had it been a while since you ate?

27
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,548
No, not really.

28
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,002
Had you been drinking?

29
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,805
Alcohol?

30
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:03,472
- No, I don't really drink.
- Don't really?

31
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:07,813
- No, I don't drink.
- You've never experienced it before?

32
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,058
No.

33
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:14,904
- Is it epilepsy?
- It's too early to tell.

34
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:20,322
- Do you have a family history of epilepsy?
- No, not that I know of.

35
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,866
I should look at your medical record.

36
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,740
Can I call your family doctor back home?

37
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:29,248
No, I'd rather you didn't.

38
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:32,372
I don't want my parents
to know about this.

39
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:36,968
They don't have to know.
I'll just talk to your doctor.

40
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,132
It's up to you if you want to tell them.

41
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,427
Well, OK.

42
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,101
Could it be serious?

43
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:49,643
The tests don't show anything abnormal.

44
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:53,393
We'll take some more tests later on
to exclude certain conditions.

45
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,104
Meanwhile, try not to think about it.

46
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,032
- Hi.
- Hi.

47
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,414
Hey, I just wanted to say hello.

48
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:01,539
I was in the reading hall

49
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:05,543
when you had some sort of...

50
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,011
- Anyway, I'm Anja.
- Thelma.

51
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:12,558
- But... Are you feeling better?
- Much better.

52
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,302
Great.

53
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,684
- Are you also studying chemistry?
- No, biology.

54
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:31,368
- Good. OK, maybe I'll see you in maths.
- Yeah.

55
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,618
- Bye.
- Bye.

56
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,740
- It's in here.
- Here?

57
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,491
Right.

58
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:49,655
But whenever
someone mentions it, you...

59
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,068
I don't know what you mean.

60
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:55,820
- I remember Sofia and Gunnar's father.
- Aksel.

61
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,414
Yes. Sofia and I
were going to summer camp.

62
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:05,254
He started talking about how fossils were
the result of the great flood.

63
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,715
You didn't say much,
just put an end to the conversation.

64
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,428
Marthe's parents too, they...

65
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:18,017
We met Marthe at the mall.
Was it last week?

66
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:21,763
- She sends her regards.
- That's nice.

67
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,559
They're very nice.

68
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:28,311
But they believe the Earth
was created 6,000 years ago.

69
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:32,110
At one time,
there was this documentary...

70
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,403
That's enough, Thelma.

71
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,533
Don't make fun of people.

72
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,199
I didn't mean to, I just...

73
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,452
Don't you agree it's strange?

74
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,581
I'm not sure I like this new attitude.

75
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,166
What do you mean?

76
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,716
A little knowledge doesn't
make us better than others.

77
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,264
How did life come to be
where there was no life?

78
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,186
Do you know?

79
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,898
No.

80
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,569
You talk as if you know everything.

81
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,036
I know I don't.

82
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,660
- Are you feeling sad?
- Yes, a little.

83
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,671
Want to sit here a while?

84
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:28,104
What's the matter?

85
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,061
I'm sorry, Daddy.

86
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,908
I don't know what's wrong with me.

87
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,745
Sometimes I think I'm better than others.

88
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,660
And I know I'm not.

89
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,034
But I can't help it.

90
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,207
I'm glad you say so.

91
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,797
Anything else?

92
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:05,430
It's just when I see girls with friends and
boyfriends, they seem uglier than me.

93
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:09,601
And they say stupid things.
I don't know why they...

94
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:18,398
I see you're getting
new friends on Facebook.

95
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,444
- Yes.
- Well?

96
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,833
What's the matter?

97
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:34,250
Well, I talk to some of them before lectures
and so on, but it stops there.

98
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,251
Seems everyone knows a lot of people
already. I don't.

99
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,095
But they have to get to know you.

100
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,596
You're a great person.

101
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,726
Thank you.

102
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,690
It'll just take some time.

103
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:15,713
We'll call you when we get home.
Take care.

104
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,628
- See you soon.
- Have a nice trip.

105
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,351
- Hi!
- Hi!

106
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,930
How nice to see you!
Are you leaving, or...

107
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:01,356
No, I was supposed to meet someone,
but it looks like they've left.

108
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,071
- Hi.
- This is Julie.

109
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,190
I'm Julie.

110
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,655
Is that just a Coke?

111
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,195
Yeah.

112
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,744
That's it? Just a Coke?

113
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,164
- Yeah.
- May I ask why?

114
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,042
My family's Christian.

115
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:24,587
- That's how I was raised.
- Really?

116
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,677
Diehard Christian?
I mean, ordinary Christian?

117
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,638
- Yeah.
- Well, that's cool.

118
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,101
Exotic. I just...

119
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:41,559
Because... Honestly,
I think that religious faith is a bit odd.

120
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:46,280
"Why?"
"Well, because God or Allah..."

121
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,524
- Or Santa Claus.
- "Santa says that's how it is."

122
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:52,904
"Santa says birth control is wrong.
Let's just have 14 kids."

123
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:57,791
"Santa says
women must cover their faces."

124
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,580
I don't get it. I think it's weird.

125
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:02,170
- Don't you believe in anything?
- No.

126
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:08,419
Only stuff that you can explain,
that has a scientific explanation.

127
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:11,342
Can you explain
how your mobile works?

128
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:18,770
- Right... What do you mean?
- Well, how does it work?

129
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:24,643
- It's not just because someone says so.
- Well, there are signals, like...

130
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,690
What kind of signals?

131
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:30,941
Well, it's not God. I know that for sure.

132
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,819
But signals that are like...

133
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,537
Help me if I'm completely...

134
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,408
But it's in that area, like... radiation.

135
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,035
- Radiation!
- But it is!

136
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:47,587
That's why it gives you cancer.
Radiation, that's the explanation.

137
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,350
<i>- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi.</i>

138
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,317
Sorry for calling so late.

139
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,063
<i>- My phone was in silent mode.
- OK.</i>

140
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,656
<i>- Is everything OK?
- Yes.</i>

141
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,946
<i>It's just your mother.</i>

142
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,910
<i>She gets nervous
when you don't answer.</i>

143
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,200
Yes, I know. Sorry.

144
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,870
<i>She's been feeling very down again.</i>

145
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,493
<i>She's in a lot of pain, you know.</i>

146
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,839
<i>Where are you? Are you outside?</i>

147
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,760
Yes. I've been out with some friends.

148
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,797
I had a lot of fun.

149
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:20,095
<i>Right.</i>

150
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:23,641
<i>I'm glad you're having fun.
Just be careful.</i>

151
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,639
I am.

152
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:29,643
<i>OK. We'll talk tomorrow.</i>

153
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,020
<i>I love you.</i>

154
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,239
I love you too.

155
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:37,655
Say hello to Mum, and tell her I'm sorry.

156
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,653
<i>Yes, I will.</i>

157
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,574
OK. Good night.

158
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,372
<i>- Good night. Bye.
- Bye.</i>

159
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:03,762
Hi.

160
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,300
Hi.

161
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,323
Thelma?

162
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:38,043
Thelma?

163
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,634
Thelma?

164
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,577
Do you want to call someone?

165
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,667
No, not now.

166
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,424
I'm sorry.

167
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,804
For what? Don't think about it.

168
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,360
Are you tired?

169
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:43,104
Yeah.

170
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,935
- Hey.
- Yeah?

171
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,524
Why did you turn up here last night?

172
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,984
Didn't you text me?

173
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,487
No, I don't think so.

174
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,786
No...

175
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:19,750
Did you know where I live?

176
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,004
I must have.

177
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,420
I've probably told you.

178
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:32,422
I got pretty drunk yesterday.
I hardly remember anything.

179
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,508
...from the extreme value theorem,
as this...

180
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:37,412
A simple application of the theorem...

181
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:06,270
I remember how Dad once held my hand
over a lit candle.

182
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:13,907
He pulled it away just before I got burned.
But it was really painful.

183
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,196
Then he said...

184
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,988
"Remember, this is what it's like in Hell,
all the time."

185
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,417
Are you kidding?

186
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:30,211
Are you... Aren't you angry with him?

187
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:32,709
No. Or...

188
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,551
It's a long time ago.

189
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,305
He's actually very kind.

190
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,512
OK!

191
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:48,142
I mean it. He's really nice.

192
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,855
I can talk about everything with him.

193
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,529
You talk about everything with your dad?

194
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,276
Yeah. Shouldn't I?

195
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:03,076
Well, I think I've talked to my dad like...

196
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,200
ten times.

197
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,167
Shit.

198
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:14,543
He lives abroad. Has loads of kids.

199
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,545
Though I'm not sure he likes children.

200
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,384
But are you angry with him?

201
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:31,233
I think I was, for a while.

202
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,361
But the older I get,

203
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:38,404
the less I feel I need him
in my life, so...

204
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,861
it's no problem.

205
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,407
"Jesus turd"?

206
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,874
- No!
- No, maybe that doesn't cut it.

207
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,373
"Jesus cunt"?

208
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:55,963
The worst what?
What do you mean, the worst?

209
00:34:55,969 --> 00:35:01,806
The worst thing you can say
if you're a Christian, like.

210
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,732
If you combine what's holy
with what's less holy.

211
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:13,147
"Jesus Sa..."

212
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:17,443
- What did you just say?
- "Jesus Sat..."

213
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,533
- A little louder.
- "Jesus Satan".

214
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:25,826
- Why are you whispering?
- "Jesus Satan"!

215
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,882
You've got one there as well.

216
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:42,221
I've got them everywhere.

217
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:47,681
- A man?
- Yeah.

218
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,430
The world's tiniest man.

219
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,228
- It's nice.
- Thanks.

220
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,692
- You OK?
- Guess I need practice.

221
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,194
You don't have to smoke.
We can go inside.

222
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:12,896
- Thank you for inviting me along.
- My pleasure.

223
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,640
I'm glad you could make it.

224
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,892
It's always nice to meet Anja's friends.

225
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:25,192
- Have you been here before?
- No, I haven't. It's really beautiful.

226
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,864
Let's see... I think it's this way.

227
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:51,718
- Here, have a snack.
- What is it?

228
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:54,971
It's one of those food bars.

229
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,565
- I don't feel like chocolate.
- You haven't eaten.

230
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:02,608
I'm OK. I don't need anything.

231
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:18,377
Hey, why couldn't Daniel come?

232
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:21,122
I broke up with him.

233
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:25,217
- Shit! What happened?
- Don't tell Mum. She really liked him.

234
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,797
- But are you OK?
- I'm fine.

235
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,460
Lord, save me from these thoughts.

236
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,546
Please, I beg you. Take them away.

237
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:15,962
Lord, save me from these thoughts.

238
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,085
Please, I beg you. Take them away.

239
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,759
Lord, save me from these thoughts.

240
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,722
Please, I beg you. Take them away.

241
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:29,142
<i>- Has it been a long day?
- Yes.</i>

242
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,442
<i>Do you manage to get some rest
when you come home?</i>

243
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,567
Yes.

244
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:41,742
<i>Do you make dinner regularly,
or do you eat takeaway?</i>

245
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,700
I mostly make dinner here.

246
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,873
<i>What did you have today?</i>

247
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,838
I made vegetable soup today.

248
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,718
<i>Do you go shopping down there?</i>

249
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,922
Yes.

250
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,852
<i>What's the matter, Thelma?</i>

251
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,606
Nothing.

252
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,774
<i>I can always tell when there's something.</i>

253
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,486
I...

254
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,240
I...

255
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:36,205
<i>You can always tell me, you know.
It's important that you do.</i>

256
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,218
I've drunk alcohol.

257
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,303
And I'm very sorry I did.

258
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:57,480
<i>How much?</i>

259
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:03,065
Just two beers with some friends.

260
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,788
<i>Was that the day you didn't call us
until late in the evening?</i>

261
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,874
Yes.

262
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:36,056
<i>Right.</i>

263
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,728
<i>Maybe it's all right.</i>

264
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:46,408
<i>You're an adult now.
Need to make your own experiences.</i>

265
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:53,456
<i>Maybe one beer isn't that bad.</i>

266
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:03,167
<i>Just make sure you don't
lose touch with who you are.</i>

267
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:09,305
No. I know.

268
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:13,894
<i>- I won't.
- Many people drink too much.</i>

269
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,438
<i>It's very easy to lose control.</i>

270
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,314
Yes.

271
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:26,065
<i>- I'm so sorry.
- It's OK.</i>

272
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:28,112
<i>It's all right, Thelma.</i>

273
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:33,747
<i>Don't worry about it.
I'm glad you told me.</i>

274
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:38,536
<i>- Try to get some sleep.
- Yes.</i>

275
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:46,210
<i>- OK, we'll talk later.
- Yes. Take care.</i>

276
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,303
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

277
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:06,652
<i>The power that conquered death</i>

278
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:15,164
<i>Lives on in those who are His</i>

279
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:19,911
<i>The grave is empty, Jesus lives now</i>

280
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,163
<i>In honour and in glory</i>

281
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:29,171
<i>Eternally, He has conquered death</i>

282
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:33,925
<i>The grave is empty, Jesus lives now</i>

283
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:37,143
<i>In honour and in glory</i>

284
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:43,063
<i>Eternally, He has conquered death</i>

285
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:47,439
<i>The grave is empty, Jesus lives now</i>

286
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:49,815
<i>- Hello! Come in.
- In honour and in glory...</i>

287
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,660
Hi.

288
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,714
Well, here you go.

289
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,175
Sorry, you want something else?

290
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:11,386
- No, it's OK.
- You sure?

291
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,346
- Yeah.
- OK, cool.

292
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:30,489
- Hi.
- Hi.

293
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,031
- You're drinking?
- Yeah.

294
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,704
Where have you been?

295
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:45,044
Haven't you seen my messages?

296
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:49,712
Yeah, sorry. It's just been hectic.
It slipped my mind.

297
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,851
Hey, sorry I had to leave.

298
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:03,063
It was nice.
Tell your mum I appreciated it.

299
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,022
I will.

300
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:13,527
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Why do you ask?

301
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,701
Did you arrive with Kristoffer?

302
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:21,077
Yeah, we came together.

303
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,533
OK.

304
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,162
Hey!

305
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:29,016
Hey, I'm not having any.

306
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:32,019
- Many of us don't smoke.
- She knows that.

307
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,074
Sorry, count me out.

308
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:53,506
Take a proper puff.

309
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:09,309
Wow. Shit.

310
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:14,937
- Can you feel anything?
- Maybe a bit.

311
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:17,655
Yeah? Like, what?

312
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:22,323
One more time.

313
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,667
- Now I feel something.
- Yeah? Good.

314
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,377
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

315
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,121
You're hammered.

316
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,084
Is this normal?

317
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:16,881
Yeah.

318
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:42,018
<i>Hey! Hello?</i>

319
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:46,781
Hey! They're making fun of you.

320
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:50,156
There's no weed in that cigarette,
just tobacco.

321
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:53,746
You know? They're mean.

322
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:59,878
- Yeah. They were kidding.
- It got out of hand.

323
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,668
Do you think it's funny?

324
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,087
No, it's not, but...

325
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,669
Oh, shit.

326
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:14,050
- Are you OK?
- I'm sorry.

327
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:19,875
The scan we just took rules out
the possibility of a tumour.

328
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:25,544
What I'm going to do is refer you
to a specialist ward for epilepsy.

329
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:27,461
- OK...
- To give you a diagnosis,

330
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:32,087
they must measure your brain activity
during a seizure.

331
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:36,888
- What do you mean?
- We just need to hospitalise you

332
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:39,887
- to observe you for a few days.
- Right.

333
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:44,107
Now, I've got your journal here.

334
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:49,195
It says you had some sort of seizure
when you were six years old.

335
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:54,864
It was diagnosed
as a nervous breakdown.

336
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,953
Are you sure?

337
00:56:56,955 --> 00:57:01,825
It says you received neuroleptic
medication for about a year,

338
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:05,203
for irregular sleep patterns.

339
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:09,298
- I didn't know that.
- You were given Nozinan.

340
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:13,966
Nozinan is a very powerful drug
to give a child.

341
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,387
Right.

342
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:23,309
Otherwise, there's very little information
here. Almost nothing.

343
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:27,776
Well, Dad's a doctor,
so he's always taken care of that stuff.

344
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:31,237
- Your father's a doctor?
- Yes, a general practitioner.

345
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:33,196
Oh.

346
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:38,115
Well, then, you should ask him about it.

347
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:41,831
- He can probably explain.
- OK.

348
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:46,002
Mummy?

349
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,487
Yes.

350
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:22,906
No, not now, Thelma.
Can't you see he's feeding?

351
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:25,499
Hey!

352
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,459
Go downstairs and draw, OK?

353
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:45,057
There. Yes.

354
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,100
Mattias?

355
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,725
Mattias!

356
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:17,904
Where's Mattias?

357
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,867
Have you taken him?

358
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,613
You mustn't do that! Where is he?

359
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,991
- I don't know.
- Tell me where you've put him.

360
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:33,877
Tell me where you've put him, Thelma!

361
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,667
You...

362
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,718
Thelma? Where have you put him?

363
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:57,902
Hush. Trond!

364
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:08,075
Trond! He's under here.

365
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:10,198
Careful, careful! Yes.

366
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:56,286
We'll try one more round.
Open your eyes.

367
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,248
Breathe quickly. In and out.

368
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:02,215
Good.

369
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:04,920
Could you close your eyes?

370
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:11,017
Open your eyes again.
Breathe more quickly.

371
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:47,512
Breathe in. Feel your lungs expand.

372
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:50,723
Hold your breath. And breathe out.

373
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:54,886
Good.

374
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:57,104
We're ready to do this.

375
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:03,069
In order to provoke a seizure,
we have to, as we discussed,

376
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:06,906
try to reach
some fairly unpleasant places.

377
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:11,201
If it's too much, just let us know.

378
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,205
OK.

379
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:23,164
How do you feel about
the upcoming exams?

380
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:25,666
Are you nervous?

381
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:28,340
Yes, quite.

382
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:37,771
It's OK to reply, but you can just
shake your head or nod.

383
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:42,733
Think about my questions.
Just let your thoughts flow freely.

384
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:54,991
You mentioned that you had
a nervous breakdown as a child.

385
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:57,998
When you were six.

386
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:03,871
Do you remember anything about that?

387
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:11,926
Do you remember anything
about your parents at the time?

388
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:14,469
It must have been hard for all of you.

389
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:18,846
Yes. No, I don't remember much.

390
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:20,618
You recently moved to the city.

391
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:25,168
Have you made any friends?

392
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:30,082
And what about boys?

393
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,383
If this is painful, try not to block it out.

394
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:48,184
Is there someone special?

395
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:55,650
Maybe it's not a boy at all?
Close your eyes.

396
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:12,758
Breathe faster now.

397
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:16,671
Faster. Good.

398
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:21,596
Breathe even faster.

399
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,291
Hello?

400
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:15,904
Hello?

401
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:21,201
And... now open your eyes.

402
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:22,661
Look into the light.

403
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:31,878
Breathe more rapidly now. Good.

404
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:46,344
I can see you're having difficult thoughts.
Don't hold back. Dive in.

405
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:56,608
Go deeper.

406
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:13,538
Breathe faster.
Keep breathing. In and out.

407
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:17,921
<i>Lord, save me from these thoughts.</i>

408
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:20,465
Please, I beg you. Take them away.
Take them away.

409
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:20,423
<i>Hi, it's Anja. I can't pick up the phone
right now, so please leave a message.</i>

410
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:00,416
I'll fast-forward a bit.

411
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:05,834
Look at this. Nothing's happening.

412
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:09,134
If it had been epilepsy,
we'd have seen significant spikes.

413
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,307
So it's not epilepsy?

414
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:16,682
No, it's not.

415
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:24,027
But what is it?
What's happening to me?

416
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:26,147
Well, it seems consistent

417
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:30,822
with what we call
psychogenic non-epileptic seizures.

418
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:33,115
OK?

419
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:36,832
These seizures may be
a symptom of something else.

420
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:41,412
A physical reaction
to mental suppression.

421
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:46,417
- I don't know what you mean.
- It might just be due to stress.

422
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:49,090
It could also be some sort of trauma.

423
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:51,471
Many different things.

424
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:56,597
But something caught my attention.

425
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:58,891
I looked at genetic predisposition.

426
01:11:58,898 --> 01:12:03,438
Your grandmother has had a fairly
extensive history of mental disorders.

427
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:09,315
- Are you telling me I'm mentally ill?
- No, it's...

428
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:11,908
- That I'm mad, like Grandma?
- No, no.

429
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:17,373
Relax. I can't access her diagnosis.

430
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:20,868
But she's been in hospital
for a long time.

431
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:24,542
You probably know
more about it than I do.

432
01:12:24,549 --> 01:12:28,418
No, I don't know much about it.
She died a long time ago.

433
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:37,468
OK. That's strange.

434
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:39,435
It says here that she...

435
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:44,809
She was a patient at Hellersmo in 2016.

436
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:51,615
The point is that you'll be referred
to a psychiatrist for diagnosis.

437
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:54,701
- No, that can't be right.
- It's true.

438
01:12:56,038 --> 01:13:00,078
It says she was still at Hellersmo
in the spring of 2016.

439
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:03,619
That's the latest.

440
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:07,964
The point is that you'll be referred
to a psychiatrist.

441
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:11,506
You'll have to take a good look
at these issues together.

442
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:27,387
Hello?

443
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:56,082
Grandma?

444
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:58,710
It's Thelma.

445
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:06,308
Trond's daughter.

446
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:17,445
Hi, it's Thelma.

447
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:25,871
She's been like this for years.
I don't think she even knows we're here.

448
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:39,919
She wasn't always like that. She used
to be lucid, but had serious delusions.

449
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:43,843
I still think the drugs she's on
are much too strong.

450
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:45,932
What sort of delusions?

451
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:51,605
Well, she was devastated
when her husband disappeared like that.

452
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:56,401
- How?
- They never found his body. Just the boat.

453
01:16:56,403 --> 01:17:00,943
She became obsessed
with the idea that it was her fault.

454
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:04,443
Well, so she was very confused.

455
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:09,869
So when she got cancer,
she was convinced she'd caused it herself.

456
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:15,120
- What do you mean?
- She thought...

457
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:19,758
That she caused things to happen.

458
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:26,052
I told your father that
the medication she's on is way too strong.

459
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:28,846
He didn't seem worried.

460
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:57,542
<i>Hi, it's Anja. I can't pick up the phone
right now, so please leave a message.</i>

461
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:13,979
...quite evident. We have n-tuple algebra,
true for all values of n.

462
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:18,351
Then we have two-
and three-dimensional interpretations...

463
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:37,248
<i>Hi, Thelma. Can't get hold of Anja...</i>

464
01:18:37,254 --> 01:18:40,838
<i>Have you heard from her?
Vilde, Anja's mum.</i>

465
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:56,093
Something's happened.
I've had these seizures.

466
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:59,305
I don't get it. This girl...

467
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:03,309
<i>What? What's happened?</i>

468
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:06,729
A girl is missing.

469
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:11,147
And I just know it's my fault.

470
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:15,693
I can't stop thinking about it. I know it.

471
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:19,238
That it's my fault.

472
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:21,156
Can I come home?

473
01:23:22,206 --> 01:23:25,040
<i>Of course you can come home, dear.</i>

474
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:28,747
OK.

475
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:52,813
I know you've spent a lot of money

476
01:23:52,819 --> 01:23:55,311
so I wouldn't have to work while I study.

477
01:23:57,241 --> 01:23:59,358
I'm sorry it turned out like this.

478
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:02,861
You can take the exam later.
Don't worry.

479
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:07,789
So what's the matter?

480
01:24:09,586 --> 01:24:12,704
I've had seizures, epileptic seizures.

481
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,711
But it's something else.

482
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:17,800
Psychogenic seizures?

483
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:19,920
Yes.

484
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:23,924
A patient of mine was diagnosed
with it a few years ago.

485
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:26,426
- OK?
- It turned out fine.

486
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:31,560
Drink your tea. Don't worry. It'll be OK.

487
01:24:37,948 --> 01:24:43,819
The doctors said it could be stress,
but I don't know. I don't get it.

488
01:24:51,545 --> 01:24:53,582
Are you OK?

489
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:57,753
Yes.

490
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:59,716
I'm just a little tired.

491
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:07,551
Don't be afraid.

492
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:11,350
We've given you something
to help you calm down.

493
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:26,111
We know what's happening to you,
Thelma. We'll help you.

494
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:51,970
I have to tell you something.

495
01:25:54,191 --> 01:25:56,183
It will be very painful.

496
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:05,274
"Quack!"

497
01:26:05,285 --> 01:26:08,449
Mum forgot the washcloth.
You have to be good and sit here.

498
01:26:08,455 --> 01:26:13,541
I'll be right back. Can you
look after this for me? Good boy!

499
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:18,709
Are you up already?
You can go back to sleep.

500
01:26:26,973 --> 01:26:31,183
Trond! Trond?

501
01:26:33,397 --> 01:26:35,639
Mattias!

502
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:38,436
Trond!

503
01:26:42,406 --> 01:26:44,318
Where is he?

504
01:26:45,242 --> 01:26:47,450
Have you done something to him?

505
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:49,068
Just say it.

506
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:52,288
- Tell me if you have.
- I haven't.

507
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:58,456
I can't find him, Trond!

508
01:27:02,092 --> 01:27:04,550
Could you look downstairs?

509
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:12,883
He's not up here either.

510
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:16,266
Why aren't you answering me?

511
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:00,560
No! No!

512
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:07,522
No!

513
01:28:48,532 --> 01:28:51,149
There's something within you.

514
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:54,869
If you truly desire something,
with body and mind,

515
01:28:54,871 --> 01:28:57,864
there's something within you
that can make it happen.

516
01:28:59,918 --> 01:29:02,285
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Yes.

517
01:29:14,975 --> 01:29:17,012
Are you awake?

518
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:20,852
Can you sit upright?

519
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:42,704
Open wide.

520
01:29:44,462 --> 01:29:46,454
Lift your tongue.

521
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:49,464
I'm sorry.

522
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:53,253
I should never have let you leave.

523
01:29:53,263 --> 01:29:54,754
I thought it was over.

524
01:29:54,764 --> 01:29:59,350
It hadn't happened
since you found God as a child.

525
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:04,020
I'm going to help you.

526
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:16,405
Dear Lord, Heavenly Father,
have mercy on me.

527
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:19,245
I have sinned in mind and deed.

528
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:21,739
My heart lusts for evil.

529
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:25,414
Purify my heart
and redeem me by the Holy Ghost.

530
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:28,754
Purify my heart and redeem me
by the Holy Ghost.

531
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:32,751
Purify my heart
and redeem me by the Holy Ghost.

532
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:36,801
Purify my heart and redeem me
by the Holy Ghost.

533
01:30:36,806 --> 01:30:39,844
Dear Lord, Heavenly Father,
have mercy on me.

534
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:42,184
I have sinned in mind and deed.

535
01:30:42,187 --> 01:30:44,349
My heart lusts for evil.

536
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:46,018
Purify my heart...

537
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:49,354
I feel angry.

538
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:52,687
I'm angry with you, God.

539
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:56,069
Why are you doing this to me?

540
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:58,992
What do you want?

541
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,493
And I feel angry with Dad as well.

542
01:31:06,836 --> 01:31:11,376
I'm not worth it.
He has to stop. I can't take it any more.

543
01:31:24,938 --> 01:31:29,478
Why can't I just be what I am?
Why isn't that possible?

544
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:31,851
What about that poor girl?

545
01:31:33,822 --> 01:31:35,905
She disappeared.

546
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:39,901
Were you angry with her as well?

547
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:44,701
No.

548
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:50,002
I was in love with her.

549
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,628
And she loved me as well, and I...

550
01:31:59,889 --> 01:32:01,801
She didn't love you, Thelma.

551
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:06,643
Think about it.

552
01:32:06,646 --> 01:32:08,979
Did she like you before you wanted her?

553
01:32:12,235 --> 01:32:15,478
Do you think she had a choice?
With what's within you?

554
01:32:20,076 --> 01:32:21,988
You were probably just lonely.

555
01:32:25,582 --> 01:32:27,869
You needed someone.

556
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:38,629
I didn't want her to disappear.

557
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:41,299
No, but deep down, you did.

558
01:32:44,517 --> 01:32:46,850
That's how it happens.

559
01:33:17,008 --> 01:33:19,546
- Good night.
- Good night.

560
01:33:30,563 --> 01:33:32,646
This is no use.

561
01:33:37,654 --> 01:33:40,237
We have to stop fooling ourselves.

562
01:33:41,866 --> 01:33:43,903
What if she does it again?

563
01:33:48,206 --> 01:33:50,664
You'll never be able to forgive yourself.

564
01:33:57,257 --> 01:33:59,044
Hey...

565
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:03,836
You're such a good man.

566
01:34:03,847 --> 01:34:05,804
You're so kind.

567
01:34:05,807 --> 01:34:09,471
But this is about something
much greater than us.

568
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:12,720
We're being tested.

569
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:17,350
And you said so yourself.

570
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:21,695
If this doesn't work,
then we have to take the consequences.

571
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:29,203
No matter how painful it is.

572
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:31,868
Or how much we love her.

573
01:34:36,379 --> 01:34:39,588
You've done everything you can.

574
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:53,849
And we'll all meet again.

575
01:36:13,059 --> 01:36:14,925
- Hi, Trond.
- Hi.

576
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:19,851
- Isn't that Thelma?
- Yes.

577
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:23,191
- Has she come to visit you?
- No, Thelma has moved back home.

578
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:26,896
Well, that's good.

579
01:37:09,574 --> 01:37:11,691
It's OK. I've got it.

580
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:40,302
I went to see Grandma
at the nursing home.

581
01:37:43,316 --> 01:37:45,649
Is that what you're planning to do to me?

582
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:49,732
Is it?

583
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:17,552
Can you please let me go?

584
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:30,519
Go to sleep.

585
01:45:05,257 --> 01:45:07,294
Trond?

586
01:45:11,388 --> 01:45:13,380
Trond?

587
01:45:20,397 --> 01:45:22,730
Trond!

588
01:45:27,112 --> 01:45:28,523
Trond?

589
01:45:57,977 --> 01:46:00,310
Where's Trond?

590
01:46:04,525 --> 01:46:06,812
What's going on?

591
01:46:51,572 --> 01:46:54,906
Thelma, don't leave. Thelma!

592
01:47:08,047 --> 01:47:10,130
Thelma!

593
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:18,009
Thelma! Thelma...

594
01:48:33,465 --> 01:48:34,626
- Hi.
- Hi.

595
01:48:43,934 --> 01:48:46,847
- You look like a real babe today.
- Thank you.

596
01:48:48,313 --> 01:48:51,101
You too. My jacket suits you.

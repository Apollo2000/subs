1
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,456
<i>I'm sexy, I'm cute</i>

2
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,166
<i>I'm popular to boot</i>

3
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,043
<i>I'm bitching, great hair</i>

4
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,795
<i>The boys all love to stare</i>

5
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,505
<i>I'm wanted, I'm hot</i>

6
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,215
<i>I'm everything you're not</i>

7
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,050
<i>I'm pretty, I'm cool</i>

8
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,718
<i>I dominate this school</i>

9
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,470
<i>Who am I? Just guess</i>

10
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,180
<i>Guys wanna touch my chest</i>

11
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,015
<i>I'm rocking, I smile</i>

12
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,809
<i>And many think I'm vile</i>

13
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,477
<i>I'm flying, I jump</i>

14
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,479
<i>You can look but
don't you hump, whoo</i>

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,022
<i>I'm major, I roar</i>

16
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,816
<i>I swear I'm not a whore</i>

17
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,568
<i>We cheer and we lead</i>

18
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,570
<i>We act like we're on speed</i>

19
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,154
<i>Hate us 'cause we're beautiful</i>

20
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,614
<i>Well, we don't like you either</i>

21
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,824
<i>We're cheerleaders</i>

22
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,993
<i>We are cheerleaders, uh-huh</i>

23
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,661
<i>Call me Big Red</i>

24
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,580
<i>I'm Wh-Wh- Whitney</i>

25
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,498
<i>C-C-C-Courtney</i>

26
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,041
<i>Dude, it's Darcy</i>

27
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,876
<i>I'm Big Bad Carver, yeah</i>

28
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,837
<i>Just call me Kasey</i>

29
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,587
<i>I'm still Big Red</i>

30
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,301
<i>I sizzle, I scorch</i>

31
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,011
<i>But now I pass the torch</i>

32
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,721
<i>The ballots are in</i>

33
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,514
<i>And one girl had to win</i>

34
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,266
<i>She's perky, she's fun</i>

35
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,642
<i>And now she's number one</i>

36
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,227
<i>K-K-Kick it, Torrance</i>

37
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,055
<i>T- T- T- Torrance</i>

38
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,701
<i>I'm strong and I'm loud</i>

39
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,036
<i>I'm gonna make you proud</i>

40
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,746
<i>I'm T- T-T- Torrance</i>

41
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,745
<i>Your captain Torrance</i>

42
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,956
<i>Let's go, Toros</i>

43
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,378
<i>We are the Toros</i>

44
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,380
<i>The mighty, mighty Toros</i>

45
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,840
<i>We're so terrific</i>

46
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,092
<i>We must be Toros</i>

47
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,011
- Yeah!
- Go, Toros!

48
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:20,640
Yeah, come on! Yeah! All right!

49
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,725
Oh, my God!

50
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,981
- Nice rack!
- Huh?

51
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,566
Oh, baby!

52
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,277
Serves her right!

53
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,446
Check out the hooters!

54
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,126
Holy shit.

55
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,810
Hey, hey, Mr. and Mrs. S.

56
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,019
Oh, look, it's Aaron.

57
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,893
Oh! Hello, Aaron.

58
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,398
Hey, can I help?

59
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:13,150
Oh, no. We're fine, thanks.
Really. Stay in your vehicle.

60
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,228
You sure?

61
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,863
Bye! Be back later!

62
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,948
- Bye.
- Bye, honey.

63
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,492
Hi.

64
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,329
Come on, Tor.

65
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,249
Can't mack on you
in front of the parentals.

66
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,667
Bye-bye!

67
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,677
Remember, he's leaving for college.

68
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:40,970
Right.

69
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,390
So, are you excited?

70
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,599
Oh, yeah!

71
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,353
It's college, Tor. I'm
really stoked, you know?

72
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:53,566
It's just, you know,
I'm gonna miss you.

73
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,025
- Really?
- Yeah.

74
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:58,028
But next year, it'll
be you and me reunited

75
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:01,031
at Cal State Dominguez Hills.

76
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,825
I'll be the experienced sophomore,

77
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,536
you'll be the hot, new freshman.

78
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:09,367
Yup. It'll be just like
high school, only better.

79
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,333
Dorm rooms.

80
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,660
Hmm.

81
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,183
I got the door, Tor.

82
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,267
Okay.

83
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,852
I got the door, Tor.

84
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,020
All right.

85
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,223
- What's up, Aaron?
- Hey, what up, Grady?

86
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,524
- Hey!
- Yeah!

87
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:39,403
Hey, hey, remember, when you get
captain, act surprised, okay?

88
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,696
Don't jinx me.

89
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,781
Hi, Torrance.

90
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,199
Hey, Aaron.

91
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,700
Ah, ladies.

92
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,826
Good luck at school.

93
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,869
Thank you.

94
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,663
Oh, Aaron, come to
one last practice?

95
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,707
You know you're still my
favorite cheerleader.

96
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,833
- Aw!
- Please?

97
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,877
I'm sorry, guys. I gotta run.

98
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,212
You're not staying for the vote?

99
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,546
Hey, I really gotta beat traffic.

100
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,215
I can't be late for orientation.

101
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,418
- But I really want...
- Hey. Hey.

102
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,297
Mmm. Trust me. You're gonna get it.

103
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,307
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

104
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:15,898
- Did you vote?
- Oh, yeah.

105
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,609
Darcy thinks she should get captain
'cause her dad pays for everything.

106
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,402
He should use some of that
money to buy her a clue.

107
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,487
Oh!

108
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,198
Courtney'll get captain.

109
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,075
The guys love clutching her butt.

110
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,827
Yeah, she's got
a lot to hang on to.

111
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,328
What's plural for "butt"?

112
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,788
On one person, I mean.

113
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,249
She puts the "ass" in "massive."

114
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,292
You put the "lude" in "deluded."

115
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,712
Yo! Can I have all your votes?

116
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,831
- Mine.
- Here's me.

117
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,303
Thank you.

118
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,931
We should get Big Red a gift, or at
least someone should say something.

119
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,599
- Pass.
- Good riddance.

120
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,684
I don't believe in osmosis.

121
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,977
It's not brown-nosing.

122
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,436
She's the departing captain.

123
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,564
She did a lot for this squad.

124
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,275
Oh, come on. Both of you sucked
before she whipped you into shape.

125
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,443
Oh, whipped? Is that what that was?

126
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,446
No one will miss Big Red, Tor.
She puts the "itch" in "bitch."

127
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,032
She puts the "whore"
in "horrifying."

128
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,326
You know, it's her last practice.
How would you feel?

129
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,161
Big Red has no feelings.

130
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,909
Just testicles.

131
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:16,293
You guys are all great athletes.

132
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,210
Thanks in large part to me.

133
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:25,127
And I know that your new captain
will keep the tradition alive.

134
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,137
Leading you to the
record sixth national

135
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:31,432
cheerleading championship,
you know is yours.

136
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:36,395
So, let's meet your new
leader, Torrance Shipman.

137
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,940
Oh, my God!

138
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:42,277
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

139
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:43,944
That slut.

140
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,447
Okay, Listen up!
I'd like to try a Wolf Wall.

141
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,282
- Oh, excellent!
- Okay, yeah! We're all going to die.

142
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,117
Torrance has got the fever, people.

143
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,702
What's a Wolf's Wall?

144
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,663
Only the hardest pyramid known
to cheerleading and mankind.

145
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,874
The words "big" and
"britches" come to mind.

146
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,084
She's crazy. She'll kill us all.

147
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,296
Hello! Some of us have not spent
the entire summer working out.

148
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,505
Right, Carver?

149
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,342
Come on, guys!
Let's be different for once.

150
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,927
We can't just rest on our laurels.

151
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,219
Why does everybody say that?

152
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,096
Maybe a laurel's
a good place to rest.

153
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,597
Come on, man. You guys
suck. Let's do this.

154
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,813
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

155
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,192
Five, six, seven, eight! Kick one.

156
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,152
Carver!

157
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,238
Five, six, seven, eight!
And one! Stick it!

158
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,698
Come on, girls! Stick it for me!

159
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,618
Five, six, seven, eight!

160
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:37,120
Go one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight. Kick one!

161
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,124
Good job! Whoo!

162
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,876
Pinch some panties.
Someone's slacking.

163
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,044
Do I look like a milkmaid?

164
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,046
'Cause somebody feels like a cow!

165
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,631
Carver, can you cradle out?

166
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,379
You bet I can.

167
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,636
Okay, ready? One, two, down, up!

168
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,179
Carver!

169
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,646
Carver!

170
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,398
Are you okay?

171
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,316
I'm fine, really.

172
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,152
Don't you guys worry about me.
It's just a scratch.

173
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,862
I'll be back to practice tomorrow,

174
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,198
so don't you guys fret, okay?

175
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,910
And I don't want you to worry at
all, because I'm a quick healer.

176
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,371
I promise, you guys.
I'm gonna be there for you.

177
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,580
You hear me?

178
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,582
Guys?

179
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,376
Bye!

180
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,216
I got captain.

181
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,177
Yeah, and you sent a girl to the
hospital on your first day.

182
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,595
Aye, aye, Captain!

183
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,265
You were listening
on the phone? Mom!

184
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,433
It's true.

185
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,102
She really should get her
own private line, you know.

186
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,305
She's growing up so fast.

187
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,732
Justin, go away.

188
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,061
- At ease, Captain.
- Oh, shut up.

189
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,989
Well, this blistering academic
schedule shouldn't get in your way.

190
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,824
You should be happy about that.

191
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,452
Why can't you accept the
fact that I'm not a genius?

192
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,662
It just kills you that I'm
not an honor student.

193
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,749
No. It kills me that you
barely make time to study.

194
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,960
If you studied half as much as you
cheer, you'd be in great shape.

195
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,045
Your priorities are...

196
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:09,298
No! Those are your priorities!
Mine are just fine.

197
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:13,302
Look, I'm just saying that
college might be less of a shock

198
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:17,599
if you take an extra lab or
language course or something.

199
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,224
What do you think?

200
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,393
Will Advanced Chem
get you off my back?

201
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,847
Not completely, but it'll help.

202
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,189
Done.

203
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:30,277
You know, mothers have killed to
get their daughters on squads.

204
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,152
That mother didn't kill anyone.
She hired a hit man.

205
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,543
Hmm.

206
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,045
Everyone, we have a new student

207
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:51,548
transferring from Mission Hills
High School in Los Angeles.

208
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,377
Please welcome Cliff Pant-One.

209
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,970
Pantone.

210
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,221
Thanks.

211
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,020
Loser!

212
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,860
Loser!

213
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,157
Wait, wait, wait. Was that, uh...

214
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,785
Was that the "loser sneeze"
I just heard right there?

215
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,488
Guys, come on.

216
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,622
I mean, what is that,
from like the 1900s?

217
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,084
Nobody does that anymore.
I don't think anybody does.

218
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,544
When I lived in Kentucky...

219
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,963
Did they still do the
loser sneeze in Kentucky?

220
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,049
No. They had, uh,
guns and homemade bombs.

221
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,175
What about LA?

222
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,886
There was a lot of attitude
in LA, but no loser sneeze.

223
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,056
I'm pretty sure the loser
sneeze is officially dead.

224
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,429
Sorry.

225
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:45,894
Loser!

226
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,890
Nice.

227
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,737
I don't think they got the
memo about the loser sneeze.

228
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,777
Uh, no, apparently not.

229
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,233
Cliff.

230
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,947
Torrance.

231
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,912
Advanced Chem. Yikes.

232
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,115
Um, afraid so.

233
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,917
Are you intimidated?

234
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,961
Yeah, a little.

235
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,039
- Really?
- No, not really.

236
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,547
So, is that your band or something?

237
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,430
The Clash? No, uh...

238
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:26,518
It's a British punk band,
circa 1977 to 1983-ish.

239
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,187
Original lineup, anyway.

240
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,810
How vintage.

241
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,990
Um, so I'll see you around then?

242
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,817
Looks like it.

243
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,828
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

244
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:49,458
Whoa! It's sexy Leslie and Jan,
Jan, the cheerleading man.

245
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,959
Hey, fags.

246
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,295
Whoa, whoa. Just because we won
more trophies than you guys,

247
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,797
that's no reason
to go get all malignant.

248
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,132
Malignant this, tool.

249
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,302
- Nice.
- Oh, right on!

250
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,762
One of these days, man.

251
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:02,971
Let it go.

252
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,890
They never even won a single game.

253
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,100
It's gotta be kinda rough on them.

254
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,644
- Besides, they're dicks.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

255
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,021
Les, tell me you have
Advanced Chem first period.

256
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,481
Advanced Chem, first period.

257
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,316
If you have a lab partner
already, I'm screwed.

258
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,318
Torrance, it's only
the second day of school,

259
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:19,238
and your academic insecurity
bit is completely tired.

260
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:25,077
You know, everyone's saying your
ambition broke Carver's leg.

261
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,163
When, really, it was the angle at
which she slammed into the ground.

262
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,832
Kasey did a massive e-mail last
night. Misspelled "leg."

263
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,959
Shut up!

264
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,412
Two G's.

265
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,838
Apparently, Carver gets home
schooling for the next three months.

266
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,507
I'm cursed.

267
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,550
Replacing her is gonna
be a nightmare.

268
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,721
Well, that's why you're
the captain, Captain.

269
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,015
Bring on the tyros, the
neophytes and the dilettanti.

270
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,850
SAT's are over, Darcy.

271
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,894
And you're still
jealous of my score.

272
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,646
Are we sure Carver's
not malingering?

273
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,857
Carver will strictly be cheering
in Special Olympics until March.

274
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,401
Nationals are February 10th.

275
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,361
Regionals are in, like, four weeks.

276
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,654
I talked to her.
She's cool with this.

277
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,114
Don't tell me Carver can cut school

278
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,157
just because she broke
her leg in three places.

279
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,034
Hello! Get a wheelchair!

280
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,327
That lucky bitch.

281
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,746
Tell me we're not actually
continuing this masquerade

282
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,872
and having tryouts.

283
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,709
Let's cut the crap
and pick somebody now.

284
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,128
Whitney's little sister
Jamie is really teeny.

285
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,713
She'll be easy to toss,
and she doesn't give lip.

286
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:18,797
Just tongue.

287
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,090
Oh, kiss my ass, Jan.

288
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,216
I'd love to.

289
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,093
If she's the best, Jamie's got it.

290
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,137
But we have to see everyone.

291
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,888
Ready, okay!

292
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,807
Wait. Hold on.

293
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,600
Let me try that again.
That was terrible.

294
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,519
Ready, okay!

295
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,097
Go, team...

296
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,642
Ready, okay!

297
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,234
Sorry.

298
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,857
Ready, okay!

299
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:42,897
Shit.

300
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,823
Be aggressive.

301
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,617
Be, be aggressive.

302
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,744
How many cheers do we
actually have to memorize?

303
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:49,911
Do we get paid for this?

304
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,913
Oh, and do I have to
provide my own uniform?

305
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,131
And I see you guys are wearing red.

306
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,633
Um, that just does not work for me.

307
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,757
Ready, okay!

308
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,763
R-C-H!

309
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,766
Toros all the way!

310
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,559
I'm sorry. I just broke
up with my boyfriend.

311
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,982
Pretty good.

312
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,077
<i>Yo, yo, yo! What's up? What's up?</i>

313
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,037
<i>It's time to get busy!</i>

314
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,789
<i>So let's kick this shit</i>

315
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,210
<i>And rock the CK
off your panties, yeah</i>

316
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,421
<i>Give my regards to Broadway</i>

317
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,591
<i>Remember me to Herald Square</i>

318
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,675
<i>Tell all the gang...</i>

319
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,219
Excuse me!

320
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,465
What's with the song?

321
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,972
Isn't this the audition
for <i>Pippin?</i>

322
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,352
No.

323
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,146
<i>Cool drink of water,
such a sweet surprise</i>

324
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,774
<i>Tastes so good
make a grown man cry</i>

325
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,610
<i>Sweet cherry pie, yeah</i>

326
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,775
<i>Whoo!</i>

327
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,032
Hi.

328
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,457
<i>Well, swinging on the front
porch Swinging on the lawn</i>

329
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,377
<i>Swinging where we want
'cause there ain't nobody home</i>

330
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,755
Okay, uh, any more questions?

331
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,708
I think we're good.

332
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,044
- Here's our girl.
- Mmm-hmm.

333
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,885
<i>Rancho Carne's not all talk</i>

334
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,716
<i>All we know is Toros rock</i>

335
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,554
<i>Shake your booties
Scream and shout</i>

336
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,106
<i>Toro players work it out</i>

337
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,442
Go, Toros!

338
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,701
And do I really have to wear
those little underwear things?

339
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,619
'Cause I don't like
wearing underwear.

340
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,704
Thanks!

341
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,051
Excuse me. Where'd you
park your Harley?

342
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,554
Get real.

343
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,974
Tattoos are strictly verboten.

344
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,556
Sorry.

345
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,362
I got bored during fourth period.

346
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,941
You need to fill one of these out.

347
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,491
Did it.

348
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,625
Missy, is it?

349
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,544
Okay, before we start, I'm afraid
we're gonna need to make sure

350
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,922
you can do a standing back tuck.

351
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,546
Standard procedure, you understand.

352
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,879
Standing back handspring
back tuck, okay?

353
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,647
Where's this girl from, Romania?

354
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,649
Can she yell?

355
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,442
We'll try an oldie.

356
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,111
<i>Awesome, oh, wow!
Like, totally freak me out!</i>

357
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,988
<i>- I mean, right on
- I mean, right on</i>

358
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,317
<i>The Toros sure are number one</i>

359
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,702
<i>I transferred from Los Angeles</i>

360
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,371
<i>Your school has no gymnastics team</i>

361
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,449
<i>This is a last resort</i>

362
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,254
Okay, so I've never
cheered before. So what?

363
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,297
How about something that
actually requires neurons?

364
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,340
Do it.

365
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,133
Front handspring,
step out, round off,

366
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,843
back handspring,
step out, round off,

367
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,672
back handspring,
full twisting lay out.

368
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,998
Hey!

369
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,874
Missy is bank.

370
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,209
Uh, bankrupt.

371
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,003
We've already so decided on Jamie.

372
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,129
Yeah.

373
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,840
Courtney, this is not a democracy.
It's a "cheerocracy."

374
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,175
I'm sorry, but I'm overruling you.

375
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,554
You are being a "cheertator,"
Torrance, and a pain in my ass!

376
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,382
We already voted.

377
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,809
Besides, Missy looks
like an uber dyke.

378
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,110
Courtney, I'm the captain.

379
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,322
I'm pulling rank, and you
can fall in line or not.

380
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:38,033
If we're gonna be the best,
we have to have the best.

381
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,783
Missy's the poo.
So take a big whiff.

382
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,051
You.

383
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,469
And you.

384
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,054
I mean, hi. I'm...

385
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,848
A cheerleader.

386
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,264
Uh, yeah. Head
cheerleader, to be exact.

387
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,019
Wow.

388
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,479
So, does Missy live here?

389
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,440
Uh, actually, she moved
back to LA, yeah.

390
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,817
Something about
evil cheerleaders or...

391
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,612
Look, I'm serious.
We have to get her.

392
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,238
Is her drug dependency
gonna be a problem?

393
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,659
Cliff, shut up. What do you want?

394
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,783
I want you on the squad.

395
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,413
You're the best. They know it.

396
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,332
They just reject the unfamiliar.

397
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,000
Thanks, but, no, thanks.

398
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,586
I mean, I plead temporary insanity.

399
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,088
See, I'm a hard-core gymnast.

400
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:37,050
No way jumping up and down, screaming,
"Go, team, go!" is gonna satisfy me.

401
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:40,972
Look, we're gymnasts, too, except
no beam, no bars, no vault.

402
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,466
Sorry. Not interested.

403
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,642
What are you doing?

404
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,853
Nothing, I just thought
that it was interesting

405
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,022
hearing Torrance's point of view.

406
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,482
How do you even know her?

407
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,356
We're old friends.

408
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,529
Ever been to a
cheerleading competition?

409
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,280
Oh, you mean like a football game?

410
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,865
No, not a game.

411
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,742
Those are like practices for us.

412
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,953
I'm talking about a tournament.

413
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,788
ESPN cameras all around,

414
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,790
hundreds of people
in the crowds cheering.

415
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,995
Wait, people cheering cheerleaders?

416
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,706
That's right. Lots of people.

417
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,588
Here's the deal, Missy.
We're the shit. The best.

418
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:19,968
We have fun, we work hard,

419
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,470
and we win national championships.

420
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,682
I'm offering you a chance
to be a part of that.

421
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,435
Think about it, Miss. I mean,
you get to wear sassy outfits.

422
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:31,606
You get to yell like you
care about something.

423
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,775
She's not the cheering type.

424
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,854
You know what?

425
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,027
Count me in.

426
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,032
Ready, girls?

427
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:51,124
<i>I said brrr
It's cold in here</i>

428
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,419
<i>I said there must be some
Toros in the atmosphere</i>

429
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,756
<i>I said brrr
It's cold in here</i>

430
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,842
<i>I said there must be some
Toros in the atmosphere</i>

431
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:04,387
<i>I said oh-ee, oh-ee, oh
Ice, ice, ice</i>

432
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,848
<i>Oh-ee, oh-ee, oh
Ice, ice, ice</i>

433
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:07,932
Here we go, girls.

434
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:19,027
Hey, practice isn't over yet.

435
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,071
Nice recruit, Torrance.

436
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:25,200
A real captain would've seen
what I saw, a big dykey loser.

437
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,403
I'd say that's strike two.

438
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,669
What the hell is up?

439
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,755
I went out on a limb for
you, and you just bail?

440
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:39,923
I'm not about stealing.

441
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,257
What are you talking about?

442
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,051
You ripped off those cheers.

443
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:46,346
Listen, Missy, our cheers
are 100% original.

444
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,722
Count the trophies.

445
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,140
Well, your trophies are bullshit,

446
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,809
because you're a sad-ass liar.

447
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,227
All right, that's it!
Get out of the car!

448
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,395
I'm gonna kick your ass!

449
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,939
Oh, really?

450
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,769
Come on.

451
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,239
You're in for a rude
awakening. Get in.

452
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,942
What? No way.

453
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,611
For real. Get in.

454
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,316
Do your thing, Isis!

455
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:48,234
<i>I said brrr
It's cold in here</i>

456
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,452
<i>There must be some
Clovers in the atmosphere</i>

457
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:55,206
<i>I said brrr
It's cold in here</i>

458
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,167
<i>There must be some
Clovers in the atmosphere</i>

459
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:01,754
<i>I said oh-ee, oh-ee, oh
Ice, ice, ice</i>

460
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:02,964
<i>Slow it down</i>

461
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:06,426
<i>Oh-ee, oh-ee, oh
Ice, ice, ice</i>

462
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,510
Here we go

463
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,757
Hey!

464
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,846
You guys enjoy the show?

465
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,724
Yes, were the ethnic festivities
to your liking today?

466
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,017
You guys are awesome.

467
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:58,394
Really? You're ready
to share those trophies?

468
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:01,356
Can we just beat these buffys
down so I can go home?

469
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,899
I'm on curfew, girl.

470
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,692
Look, there's no need for that.

471
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,027
Oh, you know what? She's right.

472
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:07,654
See, then we'd be
doing them a favor.

473
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:09,614
See, then they could feel good
about sending Raggedy Ann up here

474
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:10,907
to jack us for our cheers.

475
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,033
Raggedy Ann?

476
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:14,911
Ugly redhead with a video camera
permanently attached to her hand.

477
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:17,163
Y'all have been coming up here for
years, trying to steal our routines.

478
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,791
And we just love
seeing them on ESPN.

479
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:20,875
What are you talking about?

480
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,001
"Brrr, it's cold in here.

481
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,212
"I said there must be some
Toros in the atmosphere?"

482
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,214
I know you didn't think a
white girl made that shit up.

483
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,382
I...

484
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,050
Our free cheer service
is over as of this moment.

485
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,718
- Over!
<i>- Finito!</i>

486
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,388
God, it's like, every time we get some,
here y'all come, trying to steal it,

487
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:36,557
putting blonde hair on it and
calling it something different.

488
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,059
We've had the best squad
around for years,

489
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,894
but no one's been able
to see what we can do.

490
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,313
Oh, but you better believe all
that's gonna change this year.

491
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,733
I'm captain, and I guarantee you
we'll make it to Nationals.

492
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,736
So, just hand over the tape you made
tonight and we'll call it even for now.

493
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,029
We don't have any tape.

494
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,739
Really. We just came
to see the show.

495
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,944
What? Come on, Isis.
Let me do this.

496
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,864
You know what? Let's go.

497
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,617
Wait a minute. So that's it?

498
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,459
We're just gonna let them go?

499
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,631
Yeah, because unlike
them, we have class.

500
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,709
I swear I had no idea.

501
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,632
Well, now you do.

502
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,058
You been touched by an angel, girl.

503
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,268
Jenelope, let's go.

504
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:24,190
I can't believe those white
girls just came up here...

505
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:30,570
We just so almost got our
asses kicked back there!

506
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,488
I mean, I knew I'd seen
those routines before.

507
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,488
We used to play East
Compton all the time.

508
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,537
You really had no idea, did you?

509
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,866
Do you know what this means?

510
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,540
My entire cheerleading
career has been a lie.

511
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,295
Well, look on the bright side.

512
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,380
It's only cheerleading.

513
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,504
I am only cheerleading.

514
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,305
Do you believe in curses?

515
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,554
What are you talking about?

516
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,011
I think I'm cursed.

517
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,013
And why is that?

518
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,440
This past summer at cheer camp,

519
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:10,607
all the new seniors
had to do a dare.

520
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:13,404
See, there's this thing
called the spirit stick,

521
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,653
and it can never,
ever touch the ground.

522
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,117
Torrance Shipman, your mission,

523
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:21,367
should you choose to
accept it, and you better,

524
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,874
is to capture the spirit stick

525
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:27,996
and drop it in front
of the entire camp.

526
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,732
Y'all are such
an inspiration to us.

527
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,068
Well, I just wanted
to congratulate you guys

528
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,271
and take a picture of you

529
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,908
with the spirit stick.

530
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,737
Here.

531
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,267
Here.

532
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:26,060
I don't want it now.

533
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:29,313
No, it's okay. The spirit
stick doesn't lose anything.

534
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,858
The person who drops it, however,

535
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,357
goes to Hades!

536
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,115
I don't mean to laugh, but
cheerleading urban legends?

537
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:46,790
You're not jinxed. Shit happens.

538
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:55,756
Hey, I have to tell you something.

539
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:56,924
I'm on the phone, creep.

540
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,509
I realize that, and normally

541
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,012
I'd be listening on the other
line, but this is important.

542
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,805
Okay, what?

543
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,557
Oh! Get out!

544
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:05,975
Thank you for listening.

545
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,770
Yo.

546
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,230
- Is Aaron around?
<i>- Back later.</i>

547
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,607
- Do you know when?
<i>- No.</i>

548
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:13,941
Have him call Torrance.
It's urgent.

549
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,314
<i>All right.</i>

550
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:17,112
Big Red totally screwed us!

551
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,363
I mean monster screwed us!

552
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,365
I put this to the entire squad.

553
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,700
Swear you guys didn't know?

554
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,120
Big Red didn't exactly let any of us
help with the routines, Torrance.

555
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,872
I cannot believe she did this.

556
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,832
I feel awful. It's depraved.

557
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,418
I mean, those East Compton girls
wanted to grill our asses.

558
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,128
Big Red ran the show, man.

559
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,381
I mean, we were just flying
ignorami, for sobbing out loud.

560
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,967
We can't go to Regionals
with a stolen routine.

561
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,052
It's too risky.

562
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,430
Changing the routine now would
be total murder-suicide.

563
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:45,681
Seriously.

564
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,305
Let's not put the "duh" in "dumb."

565
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,561
How are East Compton
gonna prove anything?

566
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,313
You people are unbelievable.

567
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,523
I mean, we're talking
about cheating here.

568
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,648
Sorry, new girl,
but nobody hit your buzzer.

569
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:01,739
Look, I hate to be predictable,
but I don't give a shit.

570
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,659
We learned that routine
fair and square.

571
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,244
We logged the man-hours.

572
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,369
Don't punish the squad
for Big Red's mistake.

573
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,750
This isn't about cheating.

574
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,581
This is about winning.
Everyone in favor of winning?

575
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,685
I get what you're saying,
Missy, but there's no time.

576
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:33,562
If we don't do the routine,
we've got nothing else.

577
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,016
So, you in?

578
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,235
Whatever.

579
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:52,832
Get out of here!

580
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:56,082
Hey, this is the living room.
It's public domain.

581
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,005
<i>Yo.</i>

582
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,965
Hey, may I please speak
to Aaron? It's Torrance.

583
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:04,218
<i>He's not here. He's, uh...
He's not here. Bye.</i>

584
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,765
I'll take Famous Losers
for 200, Alex.

585
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,058
Shut up, moron!

586
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,226
It's not my fault you're in love

587
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,104
with a big gay cheerleader who
won't return your phone calls.

588
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:16,522
Aaron is not gay.

589
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,899
Oh, so someone just made
him become a cheerleader?

590
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,193
He's just busy!

591
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,488
Yeah, busy scamming on guys.

592
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,108
Give me that!

593
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,115
Bitch!

594
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,960
Where is she?

595
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,455
Come on.

596
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,175
- Oh, baby!
- Oh!

597
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,468
Whoo!

598
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:47,386
No way.

599
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,681
Sexy mama!

600
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,267
Whoo! Take it off!

601
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,845
Whoo!

602
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,773
Come on. Go, sexy.

603
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:03,646
Whoo! You're on fire, yeah!

604
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,906
You sure I can stay over
at your house tonight?

605
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:09,116
Totally fine. My parents
are at some benefit.

606
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,452
They'll be pouring themselves
into bed around dawn.

607
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:12,995
Good. We gotta start early.

608
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,540
You'll be a star cheerleader yet.

609
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,625
You know, all the
cheerleaders in the world

610
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:18,959
wouldn't help our football team.

611
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,544
Man, it's just wrong.

612
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,797
Cheering for them
is just plain mean.

613
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,799
Everybody comes to
see you ladies, anyway.

614
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,884
Because we're such fine athletes.

615
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,135
Oh, live with it.

616
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:31,514
You'll be fighting off major oglers
while we defend our sexuality.

617
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,638
What is your sexuality?

618
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:38,097
Well, Jan's straight,
while I'm controversial.

619
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,231
Are you trying to tell
me you speak fag?

620
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,690
Oh, fluently.

621
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,401
And Courtney and
Whitney, dyke-adelic?

622
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,693
- No!
- Are you kidding?

623
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:45,820
I don't think so.

624
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:49,031
See, Courtney doesn't wear
anything under her spankies.

625
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,491
That's no excuse, Jan.

626
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,333
I can't help it if my
digits slip occasionally.

627
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,621
Nuh-uh. Slip? Where?

628
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,957
Oh, come on, Missy.
Don't make him say it.

629
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,250
Oh, my God.

630
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,418
My God, too.

631
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,496
You're a sick man, Jan.

632
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,380
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

633
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:09,178
<i>put your hands together
for the Rancho Carne Toros!</i>

634
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,354
<i>And now, without further
ado let's hear it</i>

635
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,941
<i>for the five-time National
Cheerleading Champions,</i>

636
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,943
<i>the mighty Toros!</i>

637
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,745
Go! Go! Come on!

638
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,713
We're number one!

639
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:48,174
Come on! Let's hear it!

640
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,423
Whoo! Yeah!

641
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:54,555
Bring it on, baby!

642
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,758
Come on! Let's hear it! Come on!

643
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,557
Go, Toros!

644
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,817
Come on, Toros! Whoo!

645
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,402
Go, Toros!

646
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,069
Come on, Toros!

647
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,242
Come on. Yeah!

648
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,411
Yeah, Toros! Yeah!

649
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,541
Whoo!

650
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,044
Come on, guys, let's do it!

651
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:26,086
Ready?

652
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,797
<i>Yo-ho, go, everybody!</i>

653
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,091
Why don't you let your
cheerleaders play for you?

654
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,844
At least they win shit occasionally.
Oh, man, is that the best you got?

655
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,638
Yeah, come on, bring
it on, butt plug.

656
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:36,722
You want more? Okay.

657
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,891
While we're out here
kicking your ass,

658
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,893
- your cheer boys are over there...
- Ooh.

659
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,603
scamming on all your squirrel.

660
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,272
Which is cool, since you
don't have dicks anyway.

661
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,398
Mmm-hmm.

662
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,901
Bitch! Punk!

663
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:08,295
<i>Hey, Toros
That's right</i>

664
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,464
<i>The red, black and white</i>

665
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,633
<i>Guess what? Guess what?</i>

666
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,381
<i>You really suck</i>

667
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:22,810
<i>Hey, that's all right, that's okay</i>

668
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,979
<i>You're gonna pump our gas someday</i>

669
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,273
<i>That's all right That's okay</i>

670
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,650
<i>You're gonna pump our gas someday</i>

671
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,113
Come on, guys! Touchdown!
Let's go, yeah!

672
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,656
Oh!

673
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,831
Nice.

674
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:55,009
<i>Fourteen-nothing.</i>

675
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,712
- Go!
- Hut!

676
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:06,103
<i>And with 4:50 left in
the third quarter...</i>

677
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,271
Losers.

678
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,940
<i>It's Costa Mesa 34, Toros nothing.</i>

679
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,400
<i>Come on, Defense, work!</i>

680
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:12,526
Work!

681
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,570
<i>Knock them down roll them around</i>

Ooh!

Jan!

698
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,181
Go, Toros!

699
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,262
Yeah!

700
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,850
Come on, Toros!

701
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,402
You're, like,
totally his eye candy.

702
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,571
God, I can't believe
you'd do that to Aaron.

703
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,656
Do what?

704
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,240
Especially with him.

705
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,076
What are you talking about?

706
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,745
Oh, don't play dumb. We're
better at it than you.

707
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,413
You're having cheer sex with him.

708
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,166
<i>Flag on the play, it's
called against...</i>

709
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,752
<i>You guessed it, the Toros.</i>

710
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:15,673
<i>Remember, our next defeat is scheduled
for next Friday night at 8:00.</i>

711
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,169
Let's go, Toros!

712
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,971
Let's go, Toros!

713
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,137
Let's go, Toros!

714
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,136
Let's go, Toros!

715
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,980
All right!

716
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:34,108
We're sweet, we got the
whip We can't be beat

717
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,734
<i>We're the best
Our team's too cool</i>

718
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,820
<i>We got the class
to rock this school</i>

719
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,613
<i>Ah, yeah</i>

720
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,783
<i>We bad, we got the
team, we can't be had</i>

721
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,618
<i>We're the best
So score them points</i>

722
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,537
<i>You win the game
We'll rock this joint</i>

723
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:50,457
<i>Go, Toros, go, Toros
Go, go, go, Toros</i>

724
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:54,336
<i>Go, Clovers, go, Clovers
Go, go, go, Clovers</i>

725
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,255
<i>Our game is fierce and we are hip</i>

726
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:58,173
<i>So get on back
You can't touch this</i>

727
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,050
<i>Our game is bad
We're without peer</i>

728
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,386
<i>So get that weakness outta here</i>

729
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:04,638
<i>Tried to steal our bit
but you look like shit</i>

730
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,724
<i>But we're the ones
who are down with it</i>

731
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,651
I still say we use
the routine we have.

732
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,111
If we have to start over, I quit.

733
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,907
<i>And that's the game.</i>

734
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,909
Whoever here is for a new
routine, raise your hand.

735
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:30,456
<i>Final score. Cougars
42, Toros nothing.</i>

736
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,868
<i>Jan's got spirit, yes, he do</i>

737
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:37,042
<i>Jan's got spirit, how about you?</i>

738
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:39,416
Dude, you just lost.

739
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,347
So, is every game that eventful?

740
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,050
No. Thank God.

741
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,684
We have a real situation
on our hands.

742
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,395
I mean, we were humiliated
on our own turf.

743
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,522
We might have to have a rumble.

744
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,691
This is a serious problem!

745
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,815
Oh, so is your breath.

746
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,238
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

747
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,082
What are you doing?

748
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,456
Um...

749
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,509
Where's the bathroom?

750
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,010
Right there.

751
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,303
Oh!

752
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,257
Good night.

753
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,717
Night.

754
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,897
Are you into my brother?

755
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:43,975
No. I have a boyfriend.

756
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:12,052
Hello.

757
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:13,178
<i>Aaron?</i>

758
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,222
Tor, is that you?

759
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,224
Where have you been?
I keep trying to call you.

760
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,768
Yeah, I know. I've been, like,
totally busy with school

761
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:21,728
and practice and stuff. What's up?

762
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,063
Oh, it's bad, Aaron.

763
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:26,066
Miss Red snaked our routines
from the East Compton Clovers.

764
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,943
- All of our routines.
- What?

765
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:29,277
And they found out about it.

766
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,989
They showed up at the game.
Gauntlets were thrown.

767
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,908
Tell me you didn't know about this.
I mean, I don't know what to do here.

768
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:38,453
Of course, I didn't know,
but you gotta calm down.

769
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,163
<i>This is not that big a deal.</i>

770
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,374
<i>Everybody uses
everybody else's material.</i>

771
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,418
It's like this unwritten
rule or something.

772
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:45,752
That doesn't help me.

773
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,421
We can't do their
routine at Regionals

774
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,506
because they're gonna do
their routine at Regionals.

775
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,925
Come on, Tor,
you need a new routine.

776
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,593
That's all. No problem.

777
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,387
Just hire a professional
choreographer.

778
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:56,847
A choreographer?

779
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,682
<i>Look, just think of it
as collaboration.</i>

780
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:00,977
<i>The UCA totally
looks the other way.</i>

781
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:05,105
Call this guy.
His name is Sparky Polastri.

782
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,024
<i>- Pen.
- Remember Nationals last year?</i>

783
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,234
Knows his shit, all right?

784
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:13,113
Here's the number. It's 555-7219.

785
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:15,699
Thanks, Aaron. You
always know what to do.

786
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,652
Mmm-hmm. Bye, baby.

787
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:20,955
Mmm, who was that?

788
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:23,874
My sister. Mmm.

789
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,043
But you're not my sister, are you?

790
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,585
He says we should hire
a choreographer.

791
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,050
<i>Hello.</i>

792
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,379
Hi. May I please speak
to Sparky Polastri?

793
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,138
He'll need three or four days
to teach us the routine.

794
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:41,843
But here's the thing.
It's gonna cost us $2,000.

795
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:45,645
What, do I have the letters
A-T-M tattooed on my forehead?

796
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,349
We were thinking more
like D-A-D-D-Y.

797
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:52,024
Maybe I can get 500.

798
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:55,323
Okay, then we only need
1500 more by Monday.

799
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,240
What's up, Whitney?

800
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,366
Hi.

801
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,494
Here we are at the Rancho
Carne Toro car wash,

802
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:02,242
raising a little money.

803
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,622
<i>Yeah, baby, yeah!</i>

804
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:10,253
<i>Work it, Kasey!</i>

805
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,505
<i>What's up, buddy?</i>

806
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,379
<i>Come to mama.</i>

807
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:14,716
<i>Soak it up.</i>

808
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,384
<i>Working hard for our money?</i>

809
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,677
<i>That's a good shot, Les.</i>

810
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,221
You're right.

811
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:22,724
<i>Giving it a little
buff job. That's good.</i>

812
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,684
<i>Oh, that's attractive, Tor.</i>

813
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,978
<i>Looking good. Shaking the booty.</i>

814
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,943
<i>Missy, what the hell are you doing?</i>

815
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:38,573
<i>Watch it!</i>

816
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:42,365
<i>Dude, watch out for the camera.</i>

817
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:56,508
Hey, perv.

818
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,054
Hand over your 15 bucks
or get out of here.

819
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,305
What are you doing?

820
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,683
Making money from guys
ogling my goodies.

821
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:06,560
Aw, I didn't need
to hear that. I didn't.

822
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:08,353
That was an over-share.

823
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,773
Hey, Torrance. Come here a sec.

824
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:15,528
We'll just get this over with.

825
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:19,615
My brother wants to
check out your rack.

826
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:23,744
You know, I begged my
mom for a brother.

827
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,413
He'd look a little ridiculous
in that bikini, wouldn't he?

828
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:28,332
Yeah.

829
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,622
So, nice car.

830
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,878
Yeah. Um...

831
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,755
What can I say? I drive hard.

832
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,215
Shouldn't take long to wash.

833
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,718
Oh, don't even worry about it.
I got all afternoon.

834
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,887
I'll bet you do.

835
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,433
Where the hell is this guy?

836
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:49,269
Listen, we're lucky he's
even doing this for us.

837
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,833
<i>Prepare for total domination!</i>

838
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,135
<i>Y'all ready for this?</i>

839
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,361
Great.

840
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:45,660
- Thanks for coming. We're...
- Don't speak.

841
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:53,701
You. You have weak ankles.

842
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:59,169
One of your calves
is bigger than the other.

843
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,216
Too much makeup.

844
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:04,469
Not enough makeup.
What's with the skin?

845
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:06,931
Say it with me, "Sunlight"!

846
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:11,394
Male cheerleaders. Enough said.

847
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,975
Smile.

848
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,606
Don't smile.

849
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,059
Jackass.

850
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:21,691
Good general tone and musculature.

851
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,158
Report those compliments
to your ass

852
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:30,454
before it gets so big
it forms its own Web site.

853
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:36,584
And you, I take you
to be the captain,

854
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,129
which means you'll probably
need more work than anyone.

855
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,547
- Look, you don't...
- Shh...

856
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:42,591
- But...
- No, no, no, no, no.

857
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,468
Don't speak. Don't think.

858
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,922
Listen and learn.

859
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:55,680
I'm a choreographer.

860
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:57,974
That's what I do.

861
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,273
You are cheerleaders.

862
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:04,780
Cheerleaders are dancers
who have gone retarded.

863
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:08,948
What you do is a tiny,
pathetic subset of dancing.

864
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:13,496
I will attempt to transform your
robotic routines into poetry,

865
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,040
written with the human body.

866
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:19,252
Follow me or perish,
sweater monkeys.

867
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,840
I want you to think of what
you ate today. Got it?

868
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:28,137
Now cut that in half. This is called
a diet. Everyone start one today.

869
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:31,556
Darcy, honey,
you should stop eating.

870
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:35,226
You see, when you skip a meal, your
body feeds off its fat stores.

871
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:38,681
And if you skip enough, maybe
your body will eat your ass.

872
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:42,810
Why does everyone
have to go on a diet?

873
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,112
Because in cheerleading,
we throw people in the air,

874
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,611
and fat people don't go as high.

875
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:51,117
Come on, come on.
Let's get back to work!

876
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:03,922
Hold her up! I want dangerous!

877
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:05,924
I wanna feel like somebody's
gonna snap their neck!

878
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:08,927
Spirit fingers!
Give me spirit fingers!

879
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:11,805
Spirit fingers. Give me spirit!

880
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,184
Ouch! Ouch!

881
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:17,932
What? I told you I'd catch you.

882
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:22,023
Look, I understand you have
underwear up your ass right now,

883
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,900
but it beats the hell
out of a shattered skull.

884
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,478
Think about it.

885
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:41,794
Okay, now, spirit fingers.
Spirit fingers!

886
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:45,422
And spirit fingers!

887
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,470
Oh, my God!

888
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,639
These are not spirit fingers.

889
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:00,392
These are spirit fingers.

890
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,565
And these are gold.

891
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:07,778
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

892
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:11,489
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

893
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,574
Screw this.

894
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,903
I did not sign on
for spirit fingers.

895
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,369
Come on! The spirit
fingers are great!

896
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,040
Yeah, whatever.

897
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,914
We are so screwed.

898
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,462
- Hey.
- Hey.

899
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,089
What's the matter?

900
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,674
You don't wanna know.

901
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,473
Ah! Cheer crisis.

902
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:45,688
I've just gotten so bogged
down in all this crap.

903
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:49,733
Well, if it's crap,
why do you do it?

904
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:52,780
I don't know.

905
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,403
So quit.

906
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:55,950
Maybe I should.

907
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,368
Yeah, I mean, if you
don't like it anymore.

908
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,946
I didn't say that.

909
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,618
Sounds like it.

910
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,917
I don't know what I want.

911
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:07,086
I remember back when I cheered
at my school in Detroit.

912
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,088
You cheered at your
other high school?

913
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:12,634
No, I never cheered, but I know
what you're going through.

914
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:16,885
And regardless of all the
politics and the doubts,

915
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,099
and the crap,

916
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,436
you just have to know
that you can do it.

917
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,649
And if it helps,

918
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:30,064
I know you can.

919
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:32,779
You do?

920
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,773
Yeah.

921
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:42,494
All right, all right! I'm ready
to make a fool of myself.

922
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:44,825
State regionals, here we come.

923
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,681
So much better than last year.

924
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:15,523
Welcome to the world of
competitive cheerleading.

925
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:27,417
High school divisions,
please check the signs.

926
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:29,294
If you're not here,
your division will be...

927
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:32,505
Who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

928
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:37,553
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven...

929
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,260
Broncos!

930
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,604
Ready? Okay!

931
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,751
Some of these uniforms
look so skanky.

932
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:11,002
Whatever. They're white trash.

933
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,883
- Where do they get them?
- They're white trash.

934
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:18,465
Cutter, I'm gonna kick
your ass, you evil whore!

935
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,595
Get over it, hag!

936
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:22,930
She did not just hit me!

937
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:24,557
No, she's a little kid.

938
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,392
You little...

939
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:27,936
Get off me!

940
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,521
- Leave me alone!
- Stop it, Courtney!

941
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,902
Hi. You, yes.

942
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,577
Your head was down.

943
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,330
Your head was down
during that move.

944
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:49,123
How are you gonna give a proper
score if you're not looking,

945
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,793
if your head is down during a move?

946
00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:00,927
Remember, they give extra points
for alacrity and effulgence.

947
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:02,880
Did we bring those?

948
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:04,969
Oh, no. Look who's here.

949
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:16,814
Hi.

950
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:25,827
We're in trouble.

951
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:27,662
<i>And now, making their
first appearance</i>

952
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:33,211
<i>at the UCA California Regionals,
the East Compton Clovers!</i>

953
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:35,830
Yeah, Clovers!

954
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,623
Stop.

955
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,864
<i>I'm standing here with five-time
national returning champions,</i>

956
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:46,532
the Rancho Carne Toros.

957
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:52,955
Leading the squad this year
is senior Torrance Shipman.

958
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,041
<i>Torrance, one of the things
we've come to expect</i>

959
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:58,628
<i>from the Toros over the last few
years is a highly original routine.</i>

960
00:54:58,629 --> 00:54:59,921
<i>Can we expect the same this year?</i>

961
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:03,132
<i>Well, I think everyone goes
out there the same way,</i>

962
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:06,803
<i>being as prepared as they can be
and just hoping for the best.</i>

963
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:08,095
<i>We're just glad to be back here,</i>

964
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:10,656
<i>and eager to see what some of the
other squads have come up with.</i>

965
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,560
<i>Prepare for total domination!</i>

966
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,978
<i>Isn't that Sparky?</i>

967
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,981
<i>Well, thank you, Rancho
Carne Toros, and good luck.</i>

968
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,775
<i>- And now, the Mighty Muskrats...</i>
- Thanks.

969
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:23,104
<i>of Mesa Cucamonga!</i>

970
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,868
Spirit fingers.

971
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,992
They stole our routine!

972
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:06,112
Keep that Trojan spirit up!

973
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:08,114
Pump! Pump! Pump it up!

974
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:09,991
- It's the curse.
- What?

975
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:11,158
The spirit stick curse.

976
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,451
Oh, God, will you
lay off with that?

977
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,662
There's no curse, and
you're not going to Hades.

978
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:17,123
News flash! Look around.
We are in Hades!

979
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:19,827
Rancho Carne! You're up next!

980
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:24,338
<i>And now, from San
Diego, California,</i>

981
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,757
<i>the five-time
national champions,</i>

982
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:30,219
<i>the Rancho Carne Toros!</i>

983
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,971
Yeah! Yeah!

984
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:36,392
I bet this is good.

985
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,517
<i>Prepare for total domination!</i>

986
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,193
Didn't we just see this routine?

987
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,309
What the f...?

988
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:19,951
<i>The Rancho Carne Toros,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

989
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,207
Go, Toros!

990
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:23,955
Think they screwed up.

991
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:28,463
That was, um, interesting.

992
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:31,716
Y'all should've just
stuck with our routines.

993
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:32,842
Yeah.

994
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:35,163
Don't worry. We'll send you
a postcard from Nationals.

995
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:39,223
<i>Next up, the Fighting
Beavers of San Bernardino.</i>

996
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,599
- Torrance Shipman?
- Yes.

997
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,393
Tad Freeman, Universal
Cheer Association.

998
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:43,853
We have a problem.

999
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:45,438
A problem?

1000
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:47,273
Oh, yes, a very big problem.

1001
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:48,441
Hey.

1002
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:49,612
I don't know if you can imagine...

1003
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:52,153
- Hey. - ...The incredible sense
of <i>déja vu</i> I experienced

1004
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:54,947
as I was watching
that last routine.

1005
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,741
I wouldn't just now.

1006
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,785
- What?
- Official cheer business.

1007
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,621
Come on. It's me. Hey, Torrance!

1008
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,244
You see, I...

1009
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:05,993
Not now.

1010
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:08,621
That was smooth. Real smooth.

1011
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,379
I'll see her later.

1012
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,923
All righty.

1013
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:18,804
Oh, uh, by the way,
nice spirit fingers.

1014
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,848
Yeah. Well, here's another.

1015
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,019
Thanks.

1016
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:29,148
Obviously your Toros aren't the only
squad with this particular routine.

1017
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:34,153
Does the name Sparky Polastri
mean anything to you?

1018
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:35,863
- Sparky Polastri?
- Mmm-hmm.

1019
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:39,742
Apparently he's been peddling this same
routine up and down the California coast.

1020
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:41,741
Six squads total.

1021
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,372
We're holding an emergency session
of the discretionary panel.

1022
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,457
About what?

1023
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:48,501
We've never had a situation
like this before.

1024
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:50,002
We really should
disqualify you and...

1025
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,462
No, no, don't punish the squad.

1026
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:53,672
It was my choice to hire
Sparky, not theirs.

1027
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,674
Don't penalize everyone
for my bad judgment.

1028
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:58,636
But since there's
no precedent for this,

1029
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:00,304
there's nothing in the rule
books that forbids it.

1030
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,556
It's simply frowned upon.

1031
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:05,601
And I suppose we can't disqualify
you on those grounds alone.

1032
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:08,437
As defending champions, you are
guaranteed a bid to Florida,

1033
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,564
but know that
we'll be watching you.

1034
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:13,985
And don't expect to show up
at finals with that routine.

1035
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:19,698
What are you doing? You're
wrecking everything I built!

1036
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:22,243
Hey, hey, hey, it's not totally her fault.
I was the one that hooked up...

1037
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:24,495
This season should have
been gravy, okay?

1038
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:27,581
I handpicked the squad, I
delivered an idiot-proof routine.

1039
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,792
Platter, Nationals, hello!

1040
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:31,502
Don't you mean a stolen routine?

1041
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:34,213
Don't be so naive, Torrance.

1042
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:37,049
Look, the truth is I was
a real leader, okay?

1043
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,884
I did what I had to do
to win at Nationals,

1044
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:41,053
and ever since I handed
the reins over to you,

1045
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:43,973
you've run my squad
straight into the ground!

1046
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,267
If I made any mistake
as a squad leader,

1047
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:48,102
it wasn't borrowing cheers,

1048
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:50,681
it was announcing you
as my successor.

1049
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:57,062
Uh-uh. Not cool.

1050
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:02,032
Hey, Tor. Tor. Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

1051
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,409
Let me go. I just wanna
get out of here.

1052
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:05,286
Hey, Big Red's a bitch.

1053
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:08,247
We all know that.
Even she knows that.

1054
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:09,957
I don't know what
to do here, Aaron.

1055
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:12,751
Look. I know I haven't
always been there for you,

1056
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,253
since I went to college.

1057
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:17,298
It's been a rough
transition, for both of us.

1058
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:20,968
But I still care about you as much
as I ever did. You know that, right?

1059
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:22,928
- You do?
- Of course.

1060
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:25,764
Which is why I hate to see you
like this, all stressed out.

1061
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,766
It's not good for you.

1062
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:31,562
You're a great cheerleader,
Tor, and you're cute as hell.

1063
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:34,516
It's just that maybe...

1064
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:40,314
Maybe.

1065
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:43,449
You're just not captain material,

1066
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:45,823
and there's nothing
wrong with that.

1067
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,079
Maybe you should consider letting
Courtney and Whitney take over the squad.

1068
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,956
They're just like Big Red.

1069
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,625
You want me to give up captain?

1070
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:55,169
Hey, let them deal
with the politics.

1071
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,796
You just do what you do best, Tor.

1072
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,340
You cheer.

1073
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:02,715
Cheer, Tor. Okay?

1074
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:06,131
I just wanna see you happy.

1075
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,028
Bye.

1076
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:31,539
Sleep tight, sweetie.

1077
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,312
Friend of yours?

1078
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:57,690
He's my boyfriend.

1079
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:02,108
Look, Cliff, I can explain.

1080
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:03,981
No. It's cool.

1081
01:03:09,411 --> 01:03:12,956
Here, um, I made you a tape, too.

1082
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:17,248
Cliff...

1083
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:54,621
<i>Hey, Torrance, uh, it's me, Cliff.</i>

1084
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:56,707
Um, here's...

1085
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:59,335
<i>I wrote something for
you, so here it is.</i>

1086
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:03,172
Oh, Torrance

1087
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:06,300
<i>Can't stand your cheerleading squad</i>

1088
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:09,803
<i>But I love your pom-poms</i>

1089
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:14,600
<i>I'd feed you bonbons all night</i>

1090
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:15,851
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

1091
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:24,860
<i>Yeah, you got me to feel
all those butterflies inside</i>

1092
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,237
<i>In your locker I would hide</i>

1093
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:30,115
<i>The truth,
It's only you I see</i>

1094
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,368
<i>And you're just what I need</i>

1095
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:34,995
<i>I'd bring you flowers everyday</i>

1096
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:37,581
<i>Just to roll you in the hay</i>

1097
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:40,292
<i>Well, I'm feeling fine
I'm right on time</i>

1098
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:44,171
<i>I know I'll get my way</i>

1099
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:49,301
<i>And you're just what I need</i>

1100
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:52,096
<i>Not everything works as it seems</i>

1101
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:54,515
<i>Is that so hard to believe?</i>

1102
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:56,975
<i>'Cause you're just what I need</i>

1103
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:59,561
<i>And you're just what I need</i>

1104
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:02,314
<i>Not everything works as it seems</i>

1105
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,817
<i>Is that so hard to believe?</i>

1106
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:06,611
<i>Shout out</i>

1107
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:15,744
Aaron called us last night.

1108
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,414
He told us you're turning
the squad over to us.

1109
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:21,875
We want you know that just because
you bit the big one as captain,

1110
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:24,002
does not mean we're gonna
be super hard on you.

1111
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,337
- Oh!
- We'll treat you as if

1112
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:27,339
you didn't screw us
into the ground.

1113
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,962
Gee, thanks.

1114
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:32,719
Everyone, Torrance
is not to be harmed.

1115
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,173
We've already decided
on a course of action.

1116
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,485
We're gonna forego
Nationals this year.

1117
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:39,852
Everyone's already agreed to it.

1118
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:41,854
- Uh, except me.
- And me!

1119
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:43,605
Both of you can be replaced.

1120
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,566
I can't believe you guys.

1121
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:49,403
The only person who can officially resign
the post of captain is the captain,

1122
01:05:49,404 --> 01:05:50,863
and I'm not going anywhere.

1123
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:52,531
Then we'll have to overthrow you.

1124
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:53,904
Which we will!

1125
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:55,451
Enough!

1126
01:05:55,827 --> 01:06:00,205
Our whole cheering career, we've staked
our reputation on being the best,

1127
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:01,999
the most inventive.

1128
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:05,287
Now we finally have a chance
to truly be original,

1129
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:07,421
and you're all running scared.

1130
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:08,714
She's crazy.

1131
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:10,215
I am not crazy,

1132
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:12,426
and I'm not resigning
as captain either.

1133
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:14,136
You're gonna have to kill me first.

1134
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:15,714
That can be arranged.

1135
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:17,765
Shut it, Whitney! Let her talk!

1136
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:21,727
Look, I know I've screwed
up royally as captain,

1137
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:23,395
but I believe in this squad,

1138
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:25,981
and I know we can
bounce back from this.

1139
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,358
I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.

1140
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:30,194
It's gonna be hard work.

1141
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:33,864
We need a new routine,
something amazing and fresh,

1142
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:36,534
and we've got less than
three weeks till Nationals.

1143
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:40,412
But if we can do it,
if we can pull this off,

1144
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:43,457
then we can really
call ourselves original.

1145
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:44,791
Now who's with me?

1146
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,172
How about it, girls?

1147
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:52,296
It's gonna be hard without you two.

1148
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:54,919
Fine.

1149
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:57,964
Sure. Whatever.

1150
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:00,300
Okay. Let's do this.

1151
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:03,852
<i>We're gonna devote every
waking hour to practice,</i>

1152
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:07,606
<i>before school, in between
classes and after school.</i>

1153
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:10,817
<i>Afternoon practices will
have to be twice as long.</i>

1154
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:14,029
<i>We've gotta do whatever it takes
to be in perfect physical shape.</i>

1155
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,948
Yeah. You can go a little harder.

1156
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:16,990
There, there.

1157
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:18,116
Yeah, that feels good.

1158
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:20,410
Maybe we should join the squad.

1159
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,204
- Push.
- Oh, yeah.

1160
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:23,914
Fag!

1161
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:28,877
<i>And since the football team sucks
no matter how hard we cheer,</i>

1162
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,706
<i>we'll use night games
to practice, too.</i>

1163
01:07:31,923 --> 01:07:33,131
<i>But that's not all.</i>

1164
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:35,008
<i>We're gonna study
other types of movement,</i>

1165
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:36,882
<i>from swing dance,</i>

1166
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:39,304
<i>to interpretive dance...</i>

1167
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:41,348
And you flow and you...

1168
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:44,309
<i>even mime.</i>

1169
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:49,357
<i>We'll draw inspiration from martial
arts, musicals, everything.</i>

1170
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:53,357
<i>You guys know
we've got the talent.</i>

1171
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:58,033
<i>We've just gotta work our asses
off and trust our instincts.</i>

1172
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:00,868
<i>All of our instincts.</i>

1173
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,377
Tor!

1174
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,170
Wow! What are you doing here?

1175
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:14,339
Just wanted to come by and see you.

1176
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:15,716
Is this a bad time?

1177
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:17,301
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1178
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:19,636
I'm super busy. I'm
working on this project...

1179
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:21,847
Yeah, you sound super busy.

1180
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:23,348
I guess that's it.

1181
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:25,809
You were too busy to believe in me.

1182
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,686
Oh, no, no, but wait.

1183
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:31,481
You weren't too busy to sell me out
to Courtney and Whitney, were you?

1184
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:33,730
Gee, now I'm confused.

1185
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:37,314
Well, I hope you're not
too busy to hear this.

1186
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:40,567
Kiss my ass, Aaron! It's over!

1187
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,707
You're a great cheerleader, Aaron.

1188
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:50,792
It's just that...

1189
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:53,917
Maybe you're not exactly
boyfriend material.

1190
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,797
Bye-bye.

1191
01:08:58,217 --> 01:08:59,885
You're a cheerleader?

1192
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:12,064
UCA just posted the Nationals
list on the Internet.

1193
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:14,483
East Compton isn't on it.

1194
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:17,944
They couldn't raise the money
in time. They're not going.

1195
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:19,738
What do you mean,
"They're not going"?

1196
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:21,740
Torrance, that's good news.

1197
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:23,867
They cannot not go.
That's not good news.

1198
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:25,202
What are you talking about?

1199
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:27,496
They don't go, we win.
Once again we're the best.

1200
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:31,750
I define best as competing against the
best there is out there and beating them.

1201
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:33,419
They have to go.

1202
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:37,005
It's so unfair.
The first inter-city squad

1203
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,508
to get a bid to Nationals
and they can't afford to go?

1204
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,802
Look, Mom. Her head is spinning
off into another dimension.

1205
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:42,928
Justin!

1206
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:45,180
The company gets hit up for
money all the time, honey.

1207
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,306
I just can't.

1208
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:48,934
It's not that much money,
Mr. Level-Playing-Field.

1209
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:51,186
Tell them the deal.
Maybe they'll wanna help.

1210
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,480
Yeah? Okay, I'll make the call,

1211
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:55,440
but I'll tell you,
they'll probably say no.

1212
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:56,900
Don't let them.

1213
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:58,944
Think of how much it'll
mean to East Compton.

1214
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:01,113
They deserve to go.

1215
01:10:01,114 --> 01:10:03,282
Do the right thing, Dad!

1216
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:09,322
Did that just happen?

1217
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:10,827
Yeah.

1218
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:13,750
"Where we come from, cheer is
not a word we hear very often."

1219
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:16,628
"They should call us
inspiration leaders instead."

1220
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:18,755
Oh, that's deep. I like that.

1221
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:20,465
I don't know why we writing
to some talk-show host.

1222
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:22,342
It's like we begging
for charity or something.

1223
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:24,803
It's not charity. Pauletta
Patton's from our neighborhood.

1224
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:26,680
She'll understand
why we need the money.

1225
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:27,931
Tell her we need to buy donuts.

1226
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:29,558
Her big butt will understand that.

1227
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:32,310
Ha-ha! Stop being
counterproductive, all right?

1228
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:35,480
Lava, please stop teaching her these
big words before she choke on one.

1229
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:38,692
No, better I choke you, Lafred.

1230
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:40,777
- Look, Jenelope...
- You guys, stop!

1231
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:42,946
Please. Damn!

1232
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:48,201
Well, tell her about the late-night
practices we've been having.

1233
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:50,655
There you go. That's the kind of
stuff she wants to hear about.

1234
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:52,035
Now we're talking.

1235
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:10,056
You guys have to go to Nationals.

1236
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:12,009
Did you come up here
just to tell me that?

1237
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:15,187
Here. I got my dad's company
to sponsor you guys.

1238
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:16,688
What is this, hush money?

1239
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:17,814
No.

1240
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:20,192
Oh, right. It's guilt money.

1241
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:22,152
You pay our way in and you
sleep better at night

1242
01:11:22,153 --> 01:11:25,482
knowing how your whole world is
based on one big, old fat lie.

1243
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:28,530
Well, you know what?

1244
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,615
We don't need you.

1245
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:36,208
Why do you have to be so mean?

1246
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:37,959
I'm just trying to do
the right thing here.

1247
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:41,046
Look, I'm trying to be
strong for my squad, okay?

1248
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:42,714
That's what a captain does.

1249
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,674
Well, I'm a captain, too, you know,

1250
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:46,627
and I'm trying to make it right.

1251
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:49,430
You wanna make it right?

1252
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,682
Then when you go
to Nationals, bring it.

1253
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:55,727
Don't slack off because
you feel sorry for us.

1254
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:57,896
That way, when we beat you,

1255
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:00,190
we'll know it's
because we're better.

1256
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:02,769
I'll bring it. Don't worry.

1257
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:04,441
I never do.

1258
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:13,954
Yeah, your parents
just have to sign it.

1259
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:16,039
Okay, bye.

1260
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,662
Bye, Tor.

1261
01:12:26,217 --> 01:12:28,677
I listened to your tape.
I loved it.

1262
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:29,761
Great.

1263
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:31,596
Can I talk to you?

1264
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:34,224
I was upset that night.
Aaron gave me a ride home.

1265
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:36,977
It was just a good-night
kiss. It meant nothing.

1266
01:12:36,978 --> 01:12:38,680
Oh. I'm sorry.

1267
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:42,525
And I wanted you to know
that I broke up with him.

1268
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,653
Congratulations.

1269
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:49,155
He didn't believe in me.

1270
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:50,407
You did!

1271
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:51,616
Whatever.

1272
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:55,447
That's important to me!
You believed in me!

1273
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:13,930
Bite me.

1274
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:17,183
Hanging out with the air heads has really
sharpened your verbal skills, huh?

1275
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:18,636
Screw you.

1276
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:21,013
Said the cheerleader.

1277
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,726
That's right, I am a cheerleader,
and you're a dumb ass.

1278
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:28,862
Torrance likes you, okay?
She likes you.

1279
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:30,530
She has an odd way of showing it.

1280
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:31,948
Don't be stupid.

1281
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,742
She broke up with
her boyfriend for you.

1282
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:35,445
Yeah.

1283
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:40,499
Look. Do us all a favor and get over
yourself and tell her how you feel.

1284
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,747
I thought I had.

1285
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:44,704
Well, try again.

1286
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:48,253
And let me give you a little
tip from a cheerleader.

1287
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:52,677
Be aggressive.

1288
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:56,848
<i>Now back to Paulette!</i>

1289

So, is your family coming?

1315
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:23,810
I don't know if Cliff's coming.

1316
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:25,895
I totally blew it with Cliff.

1317

Forget it. My brother's an idiot.

1318

You're his sister. You
don't see him like I do.

1319
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:34,484
Yeah, and that's a good thing,
'cause that would be a crime.

<i>Now, I'm surrounded by them,

You don't wanna blow it
on something tiny.

1341
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:06,037
Look, me and my squad made it to the
big show without any of your help.

1342
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:08,286
I think we can handle it.

1343
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:10,834
Stay in bounds!

1344

If any of you step outside that
ugly blue carpet, you are dead.

Happy?

1346
01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:16,707
Yes.

1347

a half second early on all her moves.

And what the hell was that about?

1353
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:35,564
It's boom, boom...

1354

We just understand
each other, that's all.

All right, let's do this.

Gross, Kasey. You're totally
bedaubing the mirror.

1365
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:38,398
Clean it off.

Okay, okay! All right.

cheerleaders or the pressure to win.

I could make a killing selling
something like Diet Prozac.

Thank God you're here
this season, Missy.

2
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
According to the dictionary,
“fool"

3
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,874
refers to someone stupid,

4
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:40,625
or someone naive,
or not very bright.

5
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,624
Although we already know
that working man,

6
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:48,124
honest person,
people that follow the rules,

7
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,000
end up also being synonyms of fool.

8
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:55,375
But one day the abuse
us fools are used to

9
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,124
turns into a real kick in the balls.

10
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:01,625
Until you say: "Enough".

11
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:07,375
And you find yourself doing something
you never thought you could.

12
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,250
HEROIC LOSERS

13
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,499
The Methodic

14
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,249
We'll have to invest a lot of money.

15
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,625
Probably.

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,125
It's been abandoned for a long time,
over ten years.

17
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,375
But we thought,

18
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,625
why don't we call DeLuca's son

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,250
and make him an offer.
You never know.

20
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,749
You want to build a company

21
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,999
like the one that went bankrupt
in this very place?

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,624
Please explain to me
this brilliant idea, I don't get it.

23
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:04,624
Wait a moment, this is different,
it's going to be a cooperative.

24
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,499
It's giving the local farmers,
the small producers,

25
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,499
a chance to store their goods,
so they don't have to sell...

26
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,125
Antonio Fontana
is an anarchist by nature.

27
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,250
He came to this town in 1984,
when Alfonsin was president.

28
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,500
He came with his family
to manage road constructions.

29
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,124
But the money never came through,

30
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:24,124
and his wife got tired of Alsina,
and of Fontana, and left with the kids.

31
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,375
He stayed.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,375
But in the 90's the road work stopped
and he set up the tire shop.

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,624
"It's the perfect job, it lets
you think“, he confessed.

34
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,124
I'm still not seeing it, Lidia.

35
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:40,499
We have no idea how to run
a grain store facility, or do you?

36
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,374
But we can learn, Antonio.

37
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:45,124
Did Fermín's grandfather know anything
about farming when he started?

38
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:48,125
- But he went bankrupt.
- That was 30 years later.

39
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,874
Think about it.

40
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,374
Well organized,
this could employ around...

41
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,249
how many did we say?

42
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,749
About 20, 30 people.

43
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,374
30 people, are you sure?

44
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,499
At least, think about it.

45
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,624
Operators, administrative staff...

46
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,124
That's no less than 30.

47
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,375
Holy crap.

48
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:10,874
And do you think this is the right time
to do something like this?

49
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,375
- Yes!
- Yes!

50
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,875
This is the best time.

51
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,124
We couldn't be doing worse,
what else could happen?

52
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,875
Argentina
August 2001

53
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,375
Oh please.

54
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,249
Always talking about iron, man.

55
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,374
What are you talking about?

56
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,249
Of sovereignty!

57
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,749
To get rid of the English,
that's what the General bought.

58
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,874
Fermín, you used to be a smart lad,
explain it to him.

59
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,999
How can you always
argue about the same thing?

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,749
Don't you have something else
to talk about?

61
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,999
I didn't recognize you there.
Don't you think you overdid the color?

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,083
Rolo Belaúnde
is the best mechanic in this town.

63
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,374
He's the head of the train station,

64
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,249
even though the train
doesn't even stop here anymore.

65
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,249
A man from Córdoba, as loyal as any.
Stubbornly single.

66
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,874
And he had more <i>peronism</i> in him
than the 17th of October.

67
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,249
And? Did you talk with DeLuca?

68
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,874
- I talked with him.
- Yeah?

69
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:10,624
Well, the man was pretty surprised
someone wanted to buy The Methodical.

70
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,874
But apparently he's willing to talk.

71
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,708
Oh, that's a good start.

72
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:17,124
But you have to go,
you're a celebrity to him.

73
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,499
Why me?
You guys do nothing all day, you go.

74
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,999
Was I a soccer player?

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,999
- Was he a soccer player?
- Who cares?

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
He does.

77
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:27,249
Small town stuff.
Who cares that 30 years ago

78
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,730
I was a professional soccer player
in a small Buenos Aires club

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,124
and scored a last minute goal
against Chacarita in their stadium?

80
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,999
Everyone in Alsina, apparently.

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,250
Outside Alsina? No one.

82
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,624
Lidia finally convinced me,
like always,

83
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,249
and we went to the capital
to see if we could still

84
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,125
keep our hopes up with
our dream of the cooperative.

85
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,375
So, I'd have to talk with my sister,
but I think we can work something out.

86
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,000
Do you have any idea of how much

87
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,000
all of that could be worth?

88
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:18,125
I don't have
any recent estimates, but...

89
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,124
I don't know.

90
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,375
Considering
you're from Alsina and all...

91
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,750
I don't know,
I think 300 thousand could work.

92
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,625
300 thousand...

93
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,780
Close to what you were thinking?

94
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,249
- Yes.
- Yes, yes.

95
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:45,124
Um, we'd have to talk it over
with our associates, but it could be.

96
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,750
- Right?
- Right.

97
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,999
I know you came here to talk business

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,124
but, I look at him

99
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,125
and all I see is my childhood idol.

100
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,624
I don't know about that.

101
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:03,375
Did I tell you my dad had the poster,
from El Gráfico, in his office.

102
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,375
Fermín Perlassi, number five.

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,624
The pearl of the crown.

104
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,125
I'd go into his office
and see you there in the photo.

105
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,375
Amazing.

106
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,124
You're okay with talking about this?

107
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:20,375
No, not at all, ask him anything,
he loves talking about it.

108
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,250
Oh, okay.

109
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,874
Then I'd like to know about that goal.

110
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,750
Eh, you know...

111
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,999
I hit it hard with the tip of my foot,
outside the scoring area, and...

112
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,499
it went in, that's it.

113
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,874
It hit a defender first.

114
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,750
Yeah, it hit a defender and went in.

115
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,125
Perlassi.

116
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,375
Do you forgive me for making you talk
about your past as a player?

117
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,249
Can't complain, though.

118
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,874
You told some stories
about your golden days

119
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,750
and he lowered the price
by 30 thousand dollars.

120
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,874
- What?
- What are you doing?

121
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,624
- Nothing.
- Is this your surprise?

122
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,624
How many times did you see this movie?

123
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,874
- I wasn't expecting this.
- No?

124
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,375
- I wasn't ready for this.
- Get ready.

125
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,375
Are you sure?

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,249
The most important thing you need
to form a cooperative

127
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,375
is hardworking, honest, smart people.

128
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,749
That's why we went to see
Eladio and José Gómez,

129
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,000
who fit our first two conditions...

130
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,374
kind of.

131
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,375
Hello, boys.

132
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,999
How are you?

133
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,499
What's up?

134
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,874
- How are you?
- Good, good.

135
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,375
Okay, Perlassi here has an idea.

136
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,624
Yes, but...

137
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:12,750
I'm going to let Antonio tell it to you,
he'll explain it better.

138
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,749
Okay, um...

139
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:21,124
You've seen the silos over there,
they've been abandoned for ages.

140
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:25,375
When you were kids,
that used to work as a granary.

141
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,500
The idea is to form a cooperative.

142
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,625
And what's a cooperative?

143
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,124
A coop... It's like a cake.

144
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,625
Oh, and what's it made of?

145
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,250
A cake, a chocolate cake.

146
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,375
That chocolate cake belongs
to everyone in the cooperative...

147
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,499
The Gómez brothers
worked their whole lives

148
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,375
in the metallurgical company
in Villagrán.

149
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,499
They get things done.

150
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,000
So when the plants closed,
they weren't disheartened

151
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,500
and tried their hand
at the livestock industry.

152
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,124
But the boys didn't show
much restraint

153
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,750
and ended up eating
half of their investment.

154
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,375
So?

155
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,249
I think it's a good idea.

156
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,500
The other option
is the business we thought of.

157
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,625
Oh, you thought
of another business?

158
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,499
And...

159
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,624
what is it?

160
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,500
- A video store.
- A video store.

161
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,999
It could work.

162
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,375
But a lot of people have left the town,
I wouldn't know what to tell you.

163
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,249
Maybe...

164
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,625
It's not the right time?

165
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,375
Probably not.

166
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,374
Luckily the Gómez brothers
agreed that the cooperative

167
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,624
sounded better than a video store

168
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:50,250
and added the 12 thousands
they had left from their severance pay.

169
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,249
The next person we went to
was Safa the Turk.

170
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,749
I had to insist, since Fontana said
he rubbed him the wrong way,

171
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,749
but eventually I convinced him.

172
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,750
He loved the idea
and ended up giving us 11 thousand.

173
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,249
Ms. Llanos opened the safe
from her nursery

174
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,375
and gave us all her savings:
2500 dollars.

175
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,874
We went to see "Skinny" Cacheuta
at the haberdashery,

176
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,874
and right there he gave us 3000.

177
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:35,000
One on top of the other, literally.

178
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:43,125
During our usual Friday meeting
we agreed on how much we'd invest.

179
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:48,750
Belaúnde put down 6000,
Fontana 7000, and Lidia and I 15.000.

180
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,125
Everything was going good...

181
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,500
Too good.

182
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,249
- You do the talking.
- Why?

183
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,249
Because you're the only fool
who thinks

184
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,499
that <i>loco</i> Medina
could be a shareholder in anything.

185
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,624
<i>Loco</i> Medina has a fortune.

186
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,374
What are you talking about? Medina?

187
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:07,374
The county gave him
a bunch of money to move.

188
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,624
And he didn't move!

189
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,000
Exactly.

190
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,374
Hello, Antonio!

191
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,124
Hey, how are you?

192
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,374
Easy, we have guests.

193
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,499
- Mr. Perlassi.
- How do you do, Medina. What was that?

194
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
Um, dynamite, for fishing.

195
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:34,625
Fishing?

196
00:12:34,626 --> 00:12:37,999
It's easier, you don't have to sit
around with the fishing rod all day.

197
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,624
My friend Fontana over here
gets it for me.

198
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,499
But that's dangerous,
you could blow the whole place up.

199
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,124
Not at all, Medina, please tell him.

200
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,999
Soldier Atanasio Medina,
class of '52,

201
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,624
Punto Negro, San Nicolás,
at your orders.

202
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,125
At ease, soldier.

203
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,125
Medina, I'm going to explain to you
why we're here.

204
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,750
Imagine...

205
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,125
a chocolate cake.

206
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:12,750
But this cake belongs to many people.

207
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,499
- He's going to explain.
- It's a cooperative.

208
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,999
- Exactly.
- A cooperative.

209
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,375
Atanasio Medina lives at the edge
of the lake with his whole family.

210
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,499
Since he lives too close to the water,
his house gets flooded often

211
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,000
and the firefighters
have to come save him.

212
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,249
Since the county was tired of having
to evacuate him every time it rained

213
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,500
they offered him a relocation subsidy.

214
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,625
Medina took the money
and signed the papers.

215
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,500
But then he changed his mind.

216
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:45,000
He bought a second-hand car.

217
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:49,000
He bought mattresses, blankets,
clothes and toys for the kids.

218
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,624
And after his shopping spree
he was just left with exactly...

219
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:57,375
2153, put me down for that, please.

220
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,874
What about the rest of the money
they gave you?

221
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,999
You know me, Fontana,
I don't know how to manage things.

222
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,500
But put me down for that.

223
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,625
Okay.

224
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,749
I'll round it down to two thousand.

225
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,250
No, round it to 2153.

226
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:21,249
And since we were never going to get
all the money we needed

227
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,499
I went to see the biggest
businesswoman in town.

228
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,375
Carmen Lorgio.

229
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:30,500
You're the one who knows
about business, Carmen. Not us.

230
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,874
I'm offering this to you
because we thought

231
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:38,000
that maybe you'd be interested
in taking part.

232
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:43,374
Plus, a transport company

233
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:48,999
is the ideal partner for a granary,
understand?

234
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,375
Yes.

235
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,250
And how much have you raised thus far?

236
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,500
58 thousand...
almost 59 thousand dollars.

237
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,624
Hello Fermín, how are you?

238
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,000
Hernán, how are you?

239
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,749
Rodrigo?

240
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,624
In La Plata, in college.

241
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,249
I haven't seen him in ages.

242
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,250
He'll probably be here for Christmas.

243
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,125
What do you need, son?

244
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
The mechanic has the car ready for me.

245
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,125
And we have to pay him.

246
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:19,624
Well, tell Santiesteban,
he'll handle it.

247
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,874
Why? Tell him to give me the money
and I'll take it.

248
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:25,000
Hernán, please,
go talk with Santiesteban, go.

249
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,250
Say hi to Rodrigo for me.

250
00:15:27,251 --> 00:15:28,625
Thanks, see you.

251
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,749
I don't want to take up any more of
your time, you must be very occupied.

252
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,375
No, no.
You're not taking up my time and...

253
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,000
honestly, it makes me happy.

254
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,125
Look, I want to talk to you
about my son, because he...

255
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,750
Well, the thing is
since his father died,

256
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,250
he doesn't have any role models,
and I didn't know how to handle it.

257
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,374
He's not doing anything,

258
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:59,124
he comes and goes,

259
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,249
doesn't see anything through,

260
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,124
except going out,

261
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,750
drinking, getting into
as much trouble as possible.

262
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,750
That's why I think it'd be good if...

263
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,999
well...

264
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,374
for him to be with you,
hardworking people,

265
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,625
decent people.

266
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,999
It's going to help him.

267
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,249
What I mean to say is...

268
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,750
Is there a chance for him
to do something in all this?

269
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,499
Of course, Carmen.

270
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,625
Count on it.

271
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,640
Okay, I can give you
100 thousand dollars.

272
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,125
No.

273
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,250
Thank you.

274
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,875
We decided that Carmen
would keep negotiating with Deluca

275
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,250
and she managed to settle
on 250 thousand dollars.

276
00:16:56,625 --> 00:17:00,124
And since we already had
158.653,

277
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:03,124
we decided that the best thing to do
was put them somewhere safe.

278
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,499
So we went to Villagrán,

279
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,750
the largest town in the area.

280
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,499
To do what people do

281
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,125
if they want to rest easy
that their money is safe.

282
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,874
How are you, Lidia?

283
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,749
- Delighted to see you all.
- How are you?

284
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,125
- How is everyone?
- Hello.

285
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,624
Shall we?

286
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,375
- Thank you.
- Wait here? Okay.

287
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,249
- Fermín!
- What?

288
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,625
Alvarado called about the credit.

289
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,374
He says you need to go see him today,
without delay.

290
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,750
- That's what he said?
- Yes.

291
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,375
Your dossier is perfect.

292
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,374
But nowadays,
given the state of the country,

293
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,749
the bank is looking for other things

294
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,500
when it comes to deciding
whether or not to give out a loan.

295
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,249
Do you follow?

296
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,499
And your account

297
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,874
does not have the volume

298
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,000
to be granted the amount
you're asking for.

299
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,250
But I thought of a solution.

300
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:30,999
Let's say that instead of having
your money in a safe deposit box,

301
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,625
you had it in your bank account,

302
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,999
the Central Bank would see

303
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,749
that Fermín Perlassi

304
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,500
Is asking for 100 thousand,
but has in his account...

305
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,999
Um, 158.653 dollars.

306
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,874
150... perfect.

307
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,999
You see, that makes a difference.

308
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,874
Because you're asking for 60 percent
of the money in your account.

309
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:56,000
So then the credit
comes through immediately, I assure you.

310
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:01,124
I'd have to talk it over
with my associates.

311
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,749
It's not all my money, understand?

312
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,749
I understand,
I completely understand.

313
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,374
But, today 5 pm. the Central Bank

314
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,499
closes the annual balance
for credits this year.

315
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,249
And whatever doesn't come in today
passes over to March, April,

316
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,375
May, June. Who knows?

317
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:22,625
Look.

318
00:19:22,626 --> 00:19:24,374
Right now it's 2:50.

319
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,499
If you decide to do the deposit

320
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,999
in half an hour
this dossier leaves for Buenos Aires.

321
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,749
And I will personally

322
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,499
call the Central Bank

323
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,750
To tell them to check what you
have deposited in your account.

324
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,375
The credit will be approved by Monday.

325
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,500
And Tuesday, or Wednesday,

326
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,124
you will have the money in your account.

327
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,375
I guarantee it.

328
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,250
Knowledge is power.

329
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,375
I don't know who said it but it's true.
The one who knows has the power.

330
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,999
The one who doesn't,
after a little hesitation,

331
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,125
listens to the bank manager
he's trusted his whole life

332
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,249
and stops being a fool

333
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,125
to automatically turn
into a complete moron.

334
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,125
DEPOSITED

335
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:32,750
A DAY AFTER

336
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,375
Fermín!

337
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,750
The rest of the money
in your bank accounts,

338
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,500
or if you have a savings account.
- Lidia.

339
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,375
How much did he say
you could take out per week?

340
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,750
- Lidia.
- What?

341
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,124
How much did he say
you could take out per week?

342
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,000
250 pesos.

343
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,124
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

344
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,375
- What's wrong, Fermín?
- No...

345
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,500
Fermín!

346
00:22:28,501 --> 00:22:30,249
Honey, what's wrong!?

347
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,375
Fermín!

348
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:35,500
No, no, my blood pressure dropped.
That's all.

349
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,750
- I'm fine, honey. I'm fine.
- Yes?

350
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,374
Fermín, no one is going to think
it was your fault.

351
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:44,749
No?

352
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,999
And who was the idiot

353
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,374
who put all of our money
into the account?

354
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:52,374
Anyone would have done the same,
sweetheart.

355
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:55,124
No one could have imagined
this would happen.

356
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,125
I cannot believe it.

357
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,000
God damn it.

358
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,749
I didn't have time to tell anyone.

359
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,999
Everyone must think the money
is still in the security deposit box.

360
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,125
I'm going to take care of everyone.

361
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,999
You stay here, relaxed.

362
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,999
How are we going to tell them
we can't get the money from the bank?

363
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,625
I already told you.

364
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,750
I'll take care of it.

365
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,874
How are you, Turk?

366
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,499
- What can I say?
- I know, I know.

367
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,624
We're about to head to the bank

368
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,874
- to see what they can tell us.
- What are they going to say?

369
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,874
- They'll say they can't give it to you.
- Maybe.

370
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,874
- Maybe.
- Turns out I gave the money to you.

371
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:46,374
- I didn't give it to the bank.
- I know...

372
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,124
So you can't tell me the same thing.

373
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:50,083
- Okay, but wait.
- Wait for what?

374
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:52,624
I gave you the money
for the cooperative, remember?

375
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:55,749
Now it turns out you stored it in pesos
and can't get it out?

376
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,999
Let me explain what happened.

377
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,124
They told me
that if I didn't do what I did...

378
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,624
- I don't want you to explain!
- Let me speak, let me speak!

379
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,499
I'm not letting you say anything!

380
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,999
- I'm sorry! - You're sorry?
Stick your sorry up your ass!

381
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,749
Who the hell are you
to talk to me like that?

382
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,583
- I'm the dumb-ass you screwed over!
- I didn't screw over anyone!

383
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:13,499
You screwed me!
I'm going to kill you!

384
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,999
Safa!

385
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,749
Hit him and I'll kill you!

386
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,874
Get out of the way, honey.

387
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,124
Listen to me you asshole,

388
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:22,500
they screwed over an entire country
and you come pick a fight with my husband?

389
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,874
We invested all of our savings

390
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,874
so this town wouldn't disappear

391
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,999
and you come here acting like an ass?

392
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,125
Fucking hell.
As if you were the only victim here?

393
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,250
What the hell are you thinking, Safa?

394
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,499
Leave!

395
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,500
Leave because you don't know
how badly I want to shoot someone!

396
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,250
It's over, it's over.

397
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:15,125
A few days after the
<i>corralito</i> (economic measures),

398
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:18,375
something completely unexpected
happened.

399
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:25,500
Come here.

400
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:28,424
- What?
- Come on, when you hear it

401
00:25:28,425 --> 00:25:29,875
you'll be shocked.

402
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:31,500
Come in.

403
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,625
Don't you work at the bank?

404
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,499
- What's he doing here?
- Calm down, Fermín.

405
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,749
- How do you expect me to calm down?
- Fernando is my cousin Beba's son.

406
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,874
You see what happens? I told you.

407
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:43,499
Calm down, kid,
our problem isn't with you.

408
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,374
I'll tell you because I don't want
to be an accomplice to what happened.

409
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:47,749
But I don't want to lose my job.

410
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,125
Calm down,
no one is going to mention you.

411
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:55,500
- Come on! Talk! Say something.
- Okay.

412
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:58,874
This was the situation.

413
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:01,624
Last Friday, you left the bank

414
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,000
when it was closing.

415
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,750
Alvarado, the manager, let Manzi in.

416
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,500
Who's Manzi?

417
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,125
Manzi...

418
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:11,624
A lawyer from Villagrán.

419
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:13,250
A friend of the mayor.

420
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:16,500
Keep going, Fernando.

421
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:22,000
Alvarado set up a credit in pesos
for Manzi right there and then.

422
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:25,625
And with that credit in pesos,
Manzi exchanged it into dollars.

423
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:31,749
Let's say that instead of having
your money in a safe deposit box

424
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,874
you had it in your bank account,

425
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,749
the Central Bank would see

426
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,125
that Fermín Perlassi
has in his account...

427
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:42,625
Um, 158.653 dollars.

428
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:45,500
And Tuesday,

429
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:47,375
Wednesday,

430
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:52,250
you will have the money
in your account.

431
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,180
And he took all of the dollars
in the bank.

432
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,250
Ours, Fermín.

433
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:07,000
Yours and everyone else's.
He took a fortune.

434
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:09,999
He knew what was coming.

435
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,249
That's why they made you
take the dollars from the box

436
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,250
and put them in your account.

437
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,249
- Alvarado.
- I'm sorry I haven't called,

438
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,999
it's been crazy,
but it's going to be fine.

439
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,749
I just have one question.

440
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,624
- How much did you take?
- What?

441
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:38,749
How much did Manzi give you
to screw over all of us?

442
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,874
- I don't know what you mean.
- Look at me.

443
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:42,874
- Look at my face!
- Look at him and answer!

444
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:45,624
- Tell me you didn't know.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

445
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:46,958
It's not my fault.

446
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:48,999
And you pretend not to know, asshole?

447
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,874
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

448
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:52,999
You screwed all of us!
We're working class people!

449
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,499
Come here, asshole!

450
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,500
Son of a bitch!

451
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:58,125
Die, asshole!

452
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
What do you do when you realize
that it's not only one,

453
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:18,375
but a whole army of assholes
that ruined your life?

454
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,375
What do you do?

455
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:22,749
Who defends you?

456
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,250
Who do you talk to?

457
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:26,125
No one.

458
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:29,625
Suddenly you realize
that they took everything from you.

459
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,874
They kept all your savings

460
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,999
and crushed your dream.

461
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,125
And you feel like it's the worst thing
that could have happened to you.

462
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,625
Fermín!

463
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:53,250
But it wasn't.

464
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:06,250
Mom...

465
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,750
By the time I left the hospital,
the country was devastated.

466
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:07,250
It was February,

467
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:11,625
and five presidents had come and gone,
crazy as it sounds.

468
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:15,374
People were plunged into poverty.

469
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:19,125
Or in the best cases,
anguished and hopeless.

470
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:26,250
Rodrigo dropped out of college
and stayed with me.

471
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,249
Neither of us would have been able
to get over the heartbreak

472
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,750
hadn't we been together.

473
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,125
Carmen,

474
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,125
who wasn't left as penniless
as most of us,

475
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:41,375
hired the Gómez brothers
without a word.

476
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:46,625
She didn't need them, but she knew
they had families and no money.

477
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:55,000
Belaúnde patriotically held on
as the head of the phantom train station.

478
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:03,250
On top of it all, to the Medina's dismay,
it wouldn't stop raining that summer.

479
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,624
Fontana continued with his job.

480
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:11,624
With or without a crisis,
people still get flat tires.

481
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:13,999
He was sure that sooner or later

482
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,749
Manzi or Alvarado
would show up at his tire shop,

483
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,875
and he was ready to give them
a warm welcome.

484
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,375
Fontana is like that,
he never loses hope.

485
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,875
We have to kill them!

486
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,875
Argentina! Argentina!

487
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:00,874
Do you accept “patacones”?

488
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:03,999
Patacones, Lecop, quebrachos,
federales, we accept anything here.

489
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,125
A YEAR LATER

490
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,250
- Two, thank you.
- Thank you.

491
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:12,125
- Kid.
- What?

492
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Hey, Antonio.

493
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:16,249
- Is your dad still holed up in there?
- Yeah.

494
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,624
Listen to me, you'll be interested

495
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:21,750
in what we're here to tell you.
Come, listen.

496
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,625
Hello, Fermín.

497
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,750
- Hello.
- Afternoon.

498
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:30,000
You look good.

499
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:34,874
Your friend Fontana
has been looking into something.

500
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:36,749
Since when does he do that?

501
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:41,249
A good anarchist always has to be
two steps ahead of the enemy.

502
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:44,624
You're not going to believe
what we have to tell you.

503
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:46,625
Okay, turn that off and listen to us.

504
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,124
It turns out
that José Gomez's wife, Alicia,

505
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:56,499
is a nurse at Villagrán's hospital.
You know that?

506
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,874
Okay, good.

507
00:33:57,875 --> 00:34:01,999
It turns out, one day someone
checks himself into the hospital,

508
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,749
a man called Saldaña,
I don't know if you remember him.

509
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:09,124
The hermit who lived
behind the chicken farm and drank a lot.

510
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:10,874
That guy, that guy.

511
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:12,749
- Yes.
- He showed up at the hospital,

512
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,333
fucked up,

513
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:18,625
the doctors couldn't do anything
and the man was dying.

514
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,374
So Alicia was taking care of him,
talking to him and what not.

515
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:24,749
And one day,

516
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,124
she enters the room

517
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:30,874
and there's a man visiting Saldaña.

518
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:33,875
She asks him who he is
and he says he's not family.

519
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:37,125
She tells him that in that case
he can't be there,

520
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:38,875
and tells him to leave.

521
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,500
When this guy leaves,

522
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,125
Saldaña tells her that he's a man
who would give him work.

523
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:50,375
His name is Manzi.

524
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:58,374
When Alicia heard the name Manzi,

525
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:00,625
as quick as she is, you can imagine

526
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,499
she started asking questions.

527
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:08,124
And this guy told her
that the last job he'd done

528
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:10,750
was at one of this guy's farms.

529
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,500
A huge farm Manzi bought from Langara.

530
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,125
The story goes that the guy took him out
into the middle of the farm

531
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,624
and onto a little hill full of trees.

532
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:24,999
He gets him in there and tells him

533
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,250
to dig a hole three by three meters wide
and two meters deep.

534
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:36,624
And when Saldaña asks him
what the room is for

535
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:42,874
the other guy tells him it's for
a mechanical room for the pool filter

536
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:46,250
for the country house
he's going to build.

537
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:48,499
It's ridiculous, can you imagine?

538
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:53,875
You can't start with the mechanical room,
then the pool and then the house.

539
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:56,250
You think?

540
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:58,875
Are you stupid or what?

541
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,525
Don't you realize what's happening?

542
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,374
It's a vault.

543
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:07,500
He built a vault to hide the money
he stole from us.

544
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:11,250
How do you know where the guy's
gonna hide the money?

545
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:14,499
After the <i>corralito</i>
he wouldn't put the dollars in the bank.

546
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,749
But maybe a safety deposit box,
I don't know.

547
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,874
No way. Everyone's saying
that any day now

548
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:22,124
they're going to open them all.

549
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:25,749
That's why Manzi thought of the vault.

550
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,125
What he didn't think

551
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,500
was that Saldaña would tell Alicia
before kicking the bucket.

552
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:33,375
And that Alicia would tell José.

553
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,999
And José would tell me.

554
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,999
I would tell this guy.

555
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,750
And now we're telling both of you.

556
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:47,375
So? What do you think?

557
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,125
That everyone wastes their time
differently.

558
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,250
What the hell is wrong with you?

559
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,750
- Come on, please.
- Antonio.

560
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:04,625
When I found out about this
I went crazy.

561
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:10,874
I said, "Fuck yeah. Finally a shot
in justice's direction".

562
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:17,125
Look at how we found a way
to get this motherfucker back.

563
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:21,624
But it turns out our friend
wants to continue playing victim.

564
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:23,750
And the truth is he can go to hell.

565
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,499
Because we've done a lot. We've been
with him through the grieving process,

566
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,500
as we should be.

567
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,999
But it's been over a year, man.

568
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,749
I'm fed up with it.

569
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,125
- Calm down.
- I will not calm down, I've had enough.

570
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,250
I've had enough of him.

571
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:43,750
God forbid he thinks he's the only one
who's lost someone in life.

572
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:03,000
What if he's right?

573
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,000
What if he has a vault?

574
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:13,750
You know what I'm thinking?

575
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,125
If it were the other way,

576
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:19,750
if mom had lived, not you,

577
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,875
and Fontana comes over
to tell her everything he just told us.

578
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,270
What do you think she would have said?

579
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:28,999
Or worse,

580
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,500
what if I'd lost you both
and were left alone?

581
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,125
And Fontana comes over
to tell me everything.

582
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:38,625
What do you think I should do now?

583
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,250
Nothing?

584
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,625
The return of the living dead.

585
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:23,750
Come in.

586
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,375
This is the famous crowbar
to bash Manzi's head in?

587
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,625
Or Alvarado,
whoever shows up first.

588
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:45,625
Alvarado... I've wished him dead
more times that I can count.

589
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,250
What's up?

590
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,000
Got a flat tire?

591
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,250
You came to tell me
about Saldaño and...

592
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:02,125
that maybe Manzi made a vault
for himself and all that.

593
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,625
Yes. And?

594
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,625
I came to say yes.

595
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,125
Yes what?

596
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:15,250
That we have to do something.

597
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:28,749
We were about the same as before.

598
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,999
Safa was missing,

599
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,500
he closed shop and left town
convinced that we screwed him over.

600
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:36,124
And Cacheuta, poor man,

601
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:39,249
the crisis gave him
a fatal heart attack.

602
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:44,125
We told Mrs. Llanos not to worry,
that'd we'd take care of it.

603
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,999
And Lidia, of course.

604
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,750
Lidia was missing.

605
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,500
Gentlemen.

606
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:55,500
Lady.

607
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,999
Today is a historic day.

608
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,375
Because we're chasing
after Mikhail Bakunin's dream.

609
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,000
The father of anarchism.

610
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:12,250
This is the individual above
the state and the institutions.

611
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,499
The man who takes his destiny
into his own hands

612
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:23,750
which in our case is to take back
what belongs to us.

613
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:25,750
Yes, well...

614
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,374
I think there's no need

615
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:31,250
to say that

616
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,999
we're about to get ourselves
into a problem

617
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,375
much bigger
than the one we already have.

618
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,374
So...

619
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,875
If any of you

620
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,000
wants to back down for any reason

621
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:48,000
or is afraid,

622
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:49,625
which can happen...

623
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,250
This is the time to say it.

624
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:07,875
Okay.

625
00:42:07,876 --> 00:42:09,250
So, then...

626
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,249
- Hello?
- Hi, honey.

627
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,875
- Hello, honey.
- Where are you?

628
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:24,624
- I'm busy.
- When will you be home?

629
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,249
- I'll call you later.
- Okay, kisses.

630
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,500
Okay, kisses.

631
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:29,125
Kisses.

632
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,000
What was that?

633
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:34,625
A cell phone.

634
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:36,625
No, I know.
Why do you want it?

635
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:39,500
To talk.

636
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:43,124
Eladio.
You live in a small town

637
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:45,124
where everything
is ten blocks away or less.

638
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:46,250
Why do you need a phone?

639
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:48,125
They were cheap.

640
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:50,125
They?

641
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,249
You have another one?

642
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,250
Yeah, but no one's called me yet.

643
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,625
The other day
we got a good deal in Villagrán.

644
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,374
An exclusive deal for people
with their ID

645
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:04,375
ending on an odd number.

646
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,250
Thank God his is odd.

647
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,249
Mine is even.

648
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,250
And it didn't work.

649
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:15,375
Boy, half of the world has documentation
that ends on an odd number.

650
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And how do you know that,
Mr. Fontana?

651
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:21,499
They're a couple of idiots.

652
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:26,249
Okay, please,
let's get back to the matter at hand.

653
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,500
Yes.

654
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,250
There is a possibility

655
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,625
that this man, Manzi,

656
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:37,624
has a hole, safe, vault,

657
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:40,125
something like that,
in the middle of a field.

658
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,250
If that's true,

659
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:44,374
it's likely that

660
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:45,874
all the money is there.

661
00:43:45,875 --> 00:43:48,000
Ours and who knows who else's.

662
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,749
That's why

663
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:54,375
it's important for us
to agree on this right now.

664
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:58,499
If that's true, and we find it,

665
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,625
we're only going to take what's ours.

666
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:03,999
Do we all agree?

667
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,999
Excuse me Fermín,
but if that happens,

668
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,499
we're going to have to act quickly.

669
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,500
We can't stay there
counting the money.

670
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,499
- She's right.
- Yes, yes.

671
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,499
Well, yes, she's right.

672
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,250
And what do you suggest we do, Carmen?

673
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,375
I say that if it goes well
we take everything.

674
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:26,999
Then, of course, we separate our share

675
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,749
and we can donate the rest
to a charitable organization.

676
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:33,125
Because... it's not his money.

677
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:35,500
The guy is a criminal.

678
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:37,624
- Yes.
- It's true.

679
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:38,999
- She's right.
- It's true.

680
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,999
You're right Carmen, you're right.

681
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Something else that worries me.

682
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:44,875
Once we're there...

683
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,874
If the guy shows up what do we do?

684
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:48,375
We've already got that covered.

685
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,500
Yes?

686
00:44:59,501 --> 00:45:01,625
Yes, I'm from the Llanos nursery.

687
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,000
To take care of the plants.

688
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:06,250
I didn't order anything.

689
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,874
But my boss told me to come here.

690
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:10,999
No, it's not here.

691
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,499
No, I'm sorry, counselor,
I talked with him.

692
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,000
I'm sorry I'm late,
had to do some paperwork for my mom.

693
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,125
You deal with it then.

694
00:45:18,126 --> 00:45:20,374
Yes, did you see I left
a note for you?

695
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:22,624
You have a meeting with the mayor
today at seven.

696
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:23,750
Come in.

697
00:45:30,625 --> 00:45:33,374
I'm Florencia,
Mr. Manzi's secretary.

698
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:35,000
Miguel, pleased to meet you.

699
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,500
You sure there's no charge?

700
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,499
No, no. It's completely free.

701
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,624
The idea is for you to try out the service
and if you like it we'll see.

702
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:44,874
Perfect. Okay.

703
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:47,374
The plants are these ones,
and there's a small garden outside.

704
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:49,000
Tell me if you need anything.

705
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,000
Thank you.

706
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:03,624
See what I mean?

707
00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:07,249
The guy made a corral
in the middle of a crop field

708
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,124
and put some cows in it.

709
00:46:09,125 --> 00:46:10,250
That's a smokescreen.

710
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,999
It's so that the people that work here

711
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,124
don't go into that hill
where he has the money.

712
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:17,499
- I bet my life on it.
- Yes.

713
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,625
Perlassi! We're ready over here.

714
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,749
Keep an eye out.

715
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,500
- Do you have everything?
- Yes, yes.

716
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,250
What're you doing, Medina?

717
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:31,750
So they don't recognize me.

718
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,874
There's no one here.

719
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:35,999
That's why we came,
it's not necessary.

720
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,499
- You never know.
- Whatever.

721
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,124
Let's go, let's go.

722
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:40,749
Guys.

723
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:41,750
Let's get going.

724
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:47,249
What are you putting on it?

725
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,374
Fertilizer.

726
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:50,125
On the leaves?
But it goes in the roots.

727
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,375
This is a new product,
that's how you apply it.

728
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:10,749
Build a country house my ass,
he thinks we're all morons.

729
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:13,500
I don't know,
in your case it's debatable.

730
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,625
By the way, what could we do
with the casuarinas?

731
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Why?

732
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,500
Because the leaves have yellow spots.

733
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,375
Yes.

734
00:47:28,375 --> 00:47:30,125
This is due to overwatering.

735
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:32,750
But I always forget to water them.

736
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:36,000
Could also be due to lack of water.

737
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:37,749
Yes.

738
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,375
It's lack of water in this case.

739
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:49,625
Aren't you scared?

740
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:51,250
Of what?

741
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:54,500
Touching them like that,
they're supposed to be really toxic.

742
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,625
No, it's not a big deal.

743
00:48:26,125 --> 00:48:27,500
Holy crap.

744
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,500
We found it.

745
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,375
- I'm going.
- Wait.

746
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,499
Let me go in first.
In case there's...

747
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,250
- What?
- Maybe he put traps.

748
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,375
This is an alert from alarm UK16-VE.

749
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:08,999
- Did something happen, counselor?
- No.

750
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,875
No, an alarm went off.

751
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:12,375
No.

752
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,249
Everything okay?

753
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:27,124
Yes, yes.

754
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:28,499
All good, the only thing is...

755
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,625
I think I forgot my scissors.

756
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,124
I'll go get it, it's in the car.

757
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:35,124
I'll leave this here for a moment,
I'll be right back.

758
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:36,500
Sure, no problem.

759
00:50:05,625 --> 00:50:10,374
- Hello?
- An alarm went off, he's on his way.

760
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:12,250
- Get out of there now!
- What?

761
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:14,750
Son of a bitch.

762
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,124
This is an alert...
- He has an alarm, he's on his way!

763
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:20,875
I can't hear you man, what!?

764
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:27,125
Alarm!

765
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:31,875
Alarm!

766
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:34,125
The boy. He's shouting “alarm"!

767
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,375
- Get out!
- Let's go!

768
00:50:35,376 --> 00:50:36,999
- Come on!
- Let's go!

769
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,500
Manzi's coming!

770
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,499
- Come on, come on!
- God damn it.

771
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,875
Let's go! Let's go!

772
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:52,250
Let's go, let's go!

773
00:50:52,251 --> 00:50:53,374
Go, go!

774
00:50:53,375 --> 00:50:54,499
Come on, man!

775
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,625
Let's go!

776
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,499
- Come on, José!
- Let's go!

777
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,125
Manzi!

778
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:01,000
Manzi!

779
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:03,750
Manzi's coming!

780
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,624
- Go through.
- Come on, let's get out of here!

781
00:51:11,625 --> 00:51:13,250
Come on, go through.

782
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
What? What's wrong? What?

783
00:51:16,001 --> 00:51:17,749
No, no, I can't, I can't.

784
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:18,874
Relax, relax.

785
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:19,999
José, the bag!

786
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,124
- The bag!
- Go get it!

787
00:51:22,125 --> 00:51:23,374
Relax, lean on me.

788
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:25,250
Like this, let's go. Hernán!

789
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:36,999
- Come on, José!
- Let's go!

790
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,500
Open it. Careful.

791
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:40,874
Grab him. Pass your leg.

792
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:42,374
There you go, other leg.

793
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:43,500
Guys!

794
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:45,250
Let's go!

795
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:49,999
Let's go.

796
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,375
Come on, come on.

797
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,375
- Let's go!
- Close it!

798
00:52:21,625 --> 00:52:23,499
How the fuck do we get back?

799
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,750
In about three kilometers
it connects with another road.

800
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:29,249
Parallel to the highway.

801
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:31,625
- It's in pretty good shape.
- Are you sure?

802
00:52:32,375 --> 00:52:35,374
Who was the head of road works
in this area, you or me?

803
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:36,875
- Never mind.
- Okay.

804
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,374
Do you want something to drink?

805
00:52:40,375 --> 00:52:41,875
A glass of water?

806
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:43,750
Some water, sure.

807
00:53:19,625 --> 00:53:21,249
BATTERY AT 100%

808
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:22,375
POWER SUPPLY

809
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,749
Please, listen to me.

810
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:39,874
Listen to me, please.

811
00:53:39,875 --> 00:53:44,750
Please, can we talk one at a time
so we can hear each other, please.

812
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:46,750
What Florencia?

813
00:53:46,751 --> 00:53:47,999
Okay,

814
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,125
everybody pay attention to me
so I don't have to keep repeating myself.

815
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:52,750
The alarm went off.

816
00:53:52,751 --> 00:53:53,875
Was it loud?

817
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,625
No, Medina.
He gets a phone call.

818
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,249
The phone rang and the guy ran off.

819
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,874
So then he didn't call the police.

820
00:54:01,875 --> 00:54:03,124
- No.
- No.

821
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:05,249
What I want to know
is how much time passed

822
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:08,124
between the alarm going off
and Manzi getting there.

823
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:09,999
We don't know that, Carmen.

824
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
We didn't see him get there, we ran.

825
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:16,499
But if we prepare,

826
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,749
do we have time to lift the door
before Manzi gets there?

827
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:21,124
I don't know,
we have no way of knowing.

828
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:23,249
We don't even know how it was sealed.

829
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:25,499
The only thing I saw

830
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,249
is a solid steel door

831
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,374
and nothing else,
I don't know about you guys.

832
00:54:30,375 --> 00:54:32,125
No, no idea.

833
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:37,875
I know what we have to do.

834
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:40,999
Son, let the people who know speak.

835
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,750
No, no, let him speak, Carmen,
to be honest, we're all a bit lost.

836
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:51,624
We have to go
through Manzi's paperwork.

837
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:53,625
If he has an alarm it must have a bill.

838
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,999
And if we figure out
what we're dealing with

839
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,750
we have the possibility
of finding out how to turn it off.

840
00:55:02,625 --> 00:55:03,999
Good idea.

841
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,375
Yes.

842
00:55:07,125 --> 00:55:08,375
Can you do it?

843
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:17,125
See the withered edges there?

844
00:55:19,875 --> 00:55:22,625
There, the edges are kind of withered.

845
00:55:23,875 --> 00:55:25,375
Oh, this one.

846
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:26,750
Yes.

847
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:28,625
I'll fix it right away for you.

848
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:31,500
Yes, I'm leaving now.

849
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:34,500
Cancel my meeting with Quinteros.

850
00:55:34,875 --> 00:55:36,250
Did something happen?

851
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,249
Alvarado died.

852
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:40,624
From the bank?

853
00:55:40,625 --> 00:55:41,749
What happened?

854
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:44,999
The chief of police
said it was a gas leak.

855
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,374
His wife and him.

856
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:48,125
Did they have children?

857
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,499
Not that I know of.

858
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,874
It breaks my heart.

859
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:53,375
It ruins my day.

860
00:55:58,375 --> 00:55:59,750
Poor people.

861
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:03,749
Did you know him?

862
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:06,250
Yes. My dad was a client at the bank.

863
00:56:07,125 --> 00:56:10,125
And I went there several times
with everything that happened.

864
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:12,500
The crisis got to you too?

865
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:14,249
It killed us.

866
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:17,625
I was going to go study to La Plata
and had to stay home to help.

867
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,125
That sucks.

868
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:23,375
Well, luckily I got this job.

869
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,761
I need to go to the bathroom,
would you pick up the phone if it rings?

870
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:32,500
Go, I got it.

871
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,000
BILLS

872
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:04,375
SEONE ALARMS

873
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:13,625
UK16-VE

874
00:57:14,625 --> 00:57:16,500
What are you doing to the poinsettia?

875
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:18,375
You massacred her.

876
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:20,374
No, it's, um...

877
00:57:20,375 --> 00:57:23,749
Grafting, otherwise
this plant is going to die.

878
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:26,125
I'll take it with me
and when I bring it back...

879
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,750
You'll see.

880
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I know some people
aren't good with plants...

881
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:36,750
but this is something else.

882
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,499
Come on, dad. Stop it.

883
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,374
Alvarado just died,
it's not because you wished him dead.

884
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:47,624
But it gets to you.

885
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:50,875
The guy was an asshole,
a son of a bitch. But his wife?

886
00:57:53,125 --> 00:57:55,875
It felt like just a formality to Manzi.

887
00:57:57,375 --> 00:57:59,249
Everything means shit to him.

888
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:00,375
No...

889
00:58:00,875 --> 00:58:02,250
Not everything.

890
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,999
There's something he cares about

891
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,125
a lot.

892
00:58:07,125 --> 00:58:08,250
A lot.

893
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:10,625
Go, go eat.

894
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:22,500
Infrared motion sensors.

895
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:24,499
Pressure sensors.

896
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,249
Mine effect.

897
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:29,249
And a latency of 120 seconds.

898
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:31,374
If it's not deactivated

899
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:32,375
it goes off.

900
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,750
UK16-VE.

901
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,374
Does it go off at the location?

902
00:58:38,375 --> 00:58:40,000
Well, it wouldn't make much sense.

903
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,624
Although if you want it
to dissuade intruders

904
00:58:43,625 --> 00:58:44,749
it can go off.

905
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:47,625
It sends an alert
to a phone of your choosing.

906
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,875
What does it run on?

907
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:51,250
Electricity.

908
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:52,999
And if the power goes out?

909
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,124
Battery.

910
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:55,875
For up to 48 hours.

911
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,124
And if the battery

912
00:58:58,125 --> 00:59:00,249
goes below 50 percent

913
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,250
it goes off.

914
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:03,999
But even then it still has

915
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,249
24 hours of up time

916
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,650
so that your country house is safe.

917
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,625
In any case a power outage
isn't going to last two days.

918
00:59:13,875 --> 00:59:14,875
Seems impenetrable.

919
00:59:16,625 --> 00:59:19,125
Doesn't seem like it, it is.

920
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

921
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:27,875
I came to bring you the plant because...

922
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:29,749
Look at it, it's so nice.

923
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:32,375
It reminded me of you
and I thought I'd bring it.

924
00:59:32,875 --> 00:59:34,749
Oh, you shouldn't have.

925
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:36,124
Not a problem,

926
00:59:36,125 --> 00:59:37,875
I wanted you to have it,
so you'd enjoy it.

927
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:40,500
How'd you fix it?

928
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,124
You know, with those cuts
1 did the other time and...

929
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:46,375
grafting and all that.

930
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:51,374
The secret is I put it in my house
next to another plant.

931
00:59:51,375 --> 00:59:53,374
And it's kinda magical,
it has an energy...

932
00:59:53,375 --> 00:59:56,125
Plants understand each other,
they have...

933
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,125
a special...

934
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,750
connection...
Can I ask you out?

935
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:02,500
Huh?

936
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:04,750
Go out to dinner,

937
01:00:04,751 --> 01:00:07,249
watch a movie,
or get some ice cream.

938
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,124
Oh, Miguel.

939
01:00:09,125 --> 01:00:10,249
Thank you.

940
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:11,374
You're welcome.

941
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:13,250
No, but I can't, I have a boyfriend.

942
01:00:14,875 --> 01:00:17,175
It's okay, let's go the three of us,
I'm not jealous.

943
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:22,000
Okay, um...

944
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:25,000
It's okay, oh.

945
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:29,924
I'll come by during the week
to check up on the girls.

946
01:00:29,925 --> 01:00:31,000
Okay.

947
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,375
Thank you.

948
01:00:32,376 --> 01:00:33,750
Call me if you need anything.

949
01:00:34,875 --> 01:00:36,035
Okay, I need to keep working.

950
01:00:36,375 --> 01:00:37,499
Bye.

951
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,875
- Bye.
- See you.

952
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:55,500
Does anyone have any other idea?

953
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,750
We have to get the alarm code.

954
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:03,499
The one with the numbers, you know?
That one.

955
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:06,875
With that code we can enter the vault
and deactivate the alarm.

956
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:12,000
- I have an idea.
- Go ahead, Medina.

957
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:14,874
With all due respect, ma'am...

958
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:16,874
Oh, go ahead, Medina.

959
01:01:16,875 --> 01:01:19,875
Erm, okay... we beat him up.

960
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:24,999
Why don't we beat him up real good
until he gives us the passcode

961
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,500
and we stop messing around
with that son of a bitch, god damn it.

962
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:34,500
Medina, the problem is...

963
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:36,500
We're peaceful people.

964
01:01:36,875 --> 01:01:41,125
And we want to keep living peacefully
here in Alsina. Understand?

965
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:47,000
I was saying we could do it at night,
so he can't see us.

966
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,499
No, we got that, Medina.

967
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,125
We got it.

968
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:55,375
So?

969
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,750
We have to think.

970
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:03,125
I have to think.

971
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,500
It's psychological warfare.

972
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:29,625
With that!

973
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:53,999
Son, son.

974
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,249
- What? What is it?
- I've got it.

975
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,749
- I've got it.
- What?

976
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,624
I have an idea.

977
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:02,500
How to beat Manzi.
Come.

978
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:11,499
They have to steal the statue,

979
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,250
but the security system
is really complicated.

980
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:25,375
And they make it go off again and again,
and it's such a pain in the ass

981
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:28,875
that even the president of France
calls to tell them to deactivate it.

982
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,750
And he deactivates it.

983
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:33,749
But it's just an old movie,
are you kidding me?

984
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,249
Forget about the movie.

985
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:36,749
It's the idea!

986
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:38,250
Call the guys, tell them to come.

987
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,374
At this hour?

988
01:04:40,375 --> 01:04:41,625
Yes, now.

989
01:05:03,125 --> 01:05:05,374
So then your idea is

990
01:05:05,375 --> 01:05:07,624
to make him deactivate
the alarm himself?

991
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:08,625
No, the battery.

992
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:10,375
The battery.

993
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:14,374
We have to get Manzi
to disconnect the battery.

994
01:05:14,375 --> 01:05:17,125
We have to convince him
that the battery is faulty.

995
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:19,374
So he disconnects it

996
01:05:19,375 --> 01:05:23,750
and leaves the vault
only connected to the power line.

997
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:25,749
So then, when the time comes,

998
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:27,124
that time

999
01:05:27,125 --> 01:05:28,374
we cut the power.

1000
01:05:28,375 --> 01:05:29,875
And when the power goes out

1001
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,124
the alarm goes off.

1002
01:05:32,125 --> 01:05:33,125
Yes.

1003
01:05:33,126 --> 01:05:35,625
But we don't just cut
the power to the vault.

1004
01:05:37,875 --> 01:05:39,624
If it's a general blackout

1005
01:05:39,625 --> 01:05:43,375
Manzi won't think the power outage
is related to the vault.

1006
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:45,624
It's just a general blackout.

1007
01:05:45,625 --> 01:05:47,249
He's going to see it.

1008
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:49,625
And how do we know
when there's going to be a blackout?

1009
01:05:50,875 --> 01:05:52,750
Because we're going to cause it.

1010
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:56,125
He wants to blow up a transformer
at the power plant.

1011
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:58,125
You're crazy.

1012
01:05:58,126 --> 01:05:59,374
No.

1013
01:05:59,375 --> 01:06:01,624
Antonio, think about it.

1014
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:04,499
How many times have we had blackouts
because of a storm?

1015
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:05,624
A thousand times.

1016
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:08,000
But that's because a lightning bolt
hits a transformer.

1017
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:11,374
But I'm telling you everyone's going
to think that's what happened,

1018
01:06:11,375 --> 01:06:12,375
including Manzi.

1019
01:06:12,376 --> 01:06:14,750
But do you plan on leaving
the whole town in the dark?

1020
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:17,249
Yes.

1021
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:19,875
You're crazier than Bakunin.

1022
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:22,250
Yes.

1023
01:06:38,125 --> 01:06:40,125
The first thing we have to do

1024
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:41,749
is to find out

1025
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:45,750
where the electricity that goes
to the vault comes from.

1026
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:47,875
And how do we do that?

1027
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,625
We have to look at every utility pole,
one by one.

1028
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,500
Until we find one that has a box

1029
01:06:55,375 --> 01:06:56,750
with a cable that goes down.

1030
01:06:57,875 --> 01:06:59,250
And goes into the ground.

1031
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:01,624
I honestly...

1032
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:03,749
forgive me, but I don't understand.

1033
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:05,374
It's not that complicated, mom.

1034
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:08,500
Okay, but please let them
explain it to me.

1035
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:09,999
It's like this.

1036
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,500
We have to get him

1037
01:07:11,875 --> 01:07:13,250
to disconnect the battery.

1038
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Which is the only thing we can't do.

1039
01:07:16,625 --> 01:07:18,625
For that, we need to make him think

1040
01:07:19,375 --> 01:07:21,250
that the alarm works,
but the battery doesn't.

1041
01:07:22,625 --> 01:07:25,874
That's why we need to cut and restore,
cut and restore. Understand?

1042
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:29,125
That's why we need to know
where the cable goes.

1043
01:07:30,125 --> 01:07:31,624
But, excuse me,

1044
01:07:31,625 --> 01:07:33,999
hadn't the Gómez found the pole?

1045
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Yes, but we shouldn't cut the wires
at the base of the pole.

1046
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:40,750
It's like Hernán says.

1047
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:42,999
When we cut the power

1048
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,874
Manzi is going to check
where the cable goes underground.

1049
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:49,750
And if we dig a hole
at the base of the pole he'll notice.

1050
01:07:50,125 --> 01:07:52,375
- We need to see where that cable goes.
- Please, Hernán.

1051
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:03,125
I think we need to try to remain calm.

1052
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:06,499
Listen to each other.

1053
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:09,375
It's important, maybe somebody
has something to contribute.

1054
01:08:09,875 --> 01:08:10,875
Okay?

1055
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:15,375
This is a metal detector.

1056
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:19,750
Like the ones you use in the beach
to look for stuff in the sand.

1057
01:08:20,875 --> 01:08:22,249
Since the cable is so long,

1058
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:25,875
it has to be thick due
to the fall in voltage it'll suffer.

1059
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:30,750
We have to walk from the pole
and mark its path on the map.

1060
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:35,250
Extraordinary.

1061
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,750
You should listen to me
every once in a while.

1062
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:44,875
Excuse me.

1063
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,624
- Hey.
- What?

1064
01:09:02,625 --> 01:09:05,499
- The signal's stronger here.
- Yeah?

1065
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:08,125
Yeah, quite a bit,
the cable must be closer.

1066
01:09:08,875 --> 01:09:10,625
- Look, look.
- And why don't we do it here?

1067
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,624
Let's do it here then,
why do we need to keep going?

1068
01:09:13,625 --> 01:09:15,249
We'll go into Manzi's fields.

1069
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:16,500
It's safer here.

1070
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:24,749
You know what bugs me?

1071
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:25,875
What?

1072
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:29,375
That if we pull this off...

1073
01:09:30,125 --> 01:09:31,749
This son of a bitch, Manzi,

1074
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:34,875
isn't going to know
that it's an act of justice.

1075
01:09:35,875 --> 01:09:38,625
He's going to think that it's
another son of a bitch like him.

1076
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:41,250
And why do you care?

1077
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,375
What do you have to prove?

1078
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:46,125
Huh?

1079
01:09:47,375 --> 01:09:48,749
A son of a bitch

1080
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:50,749
doesn't feel like a son of a bitch,
Antonio.

1081
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:53,374
They don't get up, look themselves
in the mirror, and think:

1082
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:57,125
"Look at the piece of shit I am".
No, they don't feel any guilt.

1083
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:58,625
That's for fools like us.

1084
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:02,124
- Okay, this is ready.
- Okay.

1085
01:10:02,125 --> 01:10:03,375
Do I cut it?

1086
01:10:03,875 --> 01:10:05,499
Well, yes, I think so.

1087
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,499
- Mark the time.
- Careful, Rolo

1088
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:08,624
said it's the blue one.

1089
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:11,124
- Not the black one.
- Yes, yes, I know.

1090
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:12,500
- Let's see.
- Mark the time.

1091
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,250
- I'm gonna do it, okay?
- Ready.

1092
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:26,249
POWER LINE

1093
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:27,624
BATTERY

1094
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:28,999
BATTERY AT 100%

1095
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,875
BATTERY AT 99%

1096
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:35,624
It's transformer number three,

1097
01:10:35,625 --> 01:10:38,375
the line that goes
from Alsina to Villagrán.

1098
01:10:38,875 --> 01:10:40,124
But which one is it?

1099
01:10:40,125 --> 01:10:42,250
The one in front of the door,
the middle one.

1100
01:10:43,125 --> 01:10:45,750
The voltage on these things
is crazy high.

1101
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,375
You need to be crazy to go in there.

1102
01:10:49,375 --> 01:10:50,625
So what do we do then?

1103
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:54,625
We'll think of something.

1104
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:01,625
24 HOURS LATER

1105
01:11:05,875 --> 01:11:06,875
Join them.

1106
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:09,375
Join them,
the battery passed its limit.

1107
01:11:09,875 --> 01:11:11,999
The alarm should've gone off.
Need help?

1108
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,250
Nah.

1109
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:22,875
God fucking damn...

1110
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:09,874
He's calling someone.

1111
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:11,374
What do we do?

1112
01:12:11,375 --> 01:12:13,625
Let's wait for him to leave,
or he could see us.

1113
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:19,875
Rolo.

1114
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:22,625
Rolo! Come here.

1115
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:27,500
Look.

1116
01:12:27,501 --> 01:12:29,750
He called Seoane,
from the alarm company.

1117
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:32,750
What a beautiful moment.

1118
01:12:33,125 --> 01:12:34,749
- What a moment.
- Yeah.

1119
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:37,500
Seeing this son of a bitch
full of questions.

1120
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:45,250
The circuit works fine.

1121
01:12:45,875 --> 01:12:47,750
You're saying the battery

1122
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:49,374
was half full?

1123
01:12:49,375 --> 01:12:50,750
Again, with this?

1124
01:12:51,125 --> 01:12:52,500
I already told you, yes.

1125
01:12:52,875 --> 01:12:55,374
It said 40-something percent, this time.

1126
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:58,374
Because the first time it went off
the battery was full.

1127
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:00,625
- Well now it's at 100.
- Yes, I know it's at 100.

1128
01:13:01,375 --> 01:13:03,374
I don't know,
the power line might've gone out.

1129
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:05,875
No, the power line didn't fucking go out.

1130
01:13:06,375 --> 01:13:07,874
The line comes from Villagrán.

1131
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:09,375
And it didn't go out there.

1132
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:12,374
I don't know what to tell you,
everything works fine here.

1133
01:13:12,375 --> 01:13:13,749
If you want we can check the cable.

1134
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:15,374
I do, of course I do.

1135
01:13:15,375 --> 01:13:18,500
Okay, I'll go up
and let you set the alarm.

1136
01:13:35,375 --> 01:13:39,125
Anyways what could happen out here
in the middle of nowhere?

1137
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:42,749
What did you say?

1138
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:44,500
I mean, I'm just saying it's far away.

1139
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:48,375
And what the fuck do you care
if it's in the middle of nowhere?

1140
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:51,749
Why the fuck would you say that
it's in the middle of nowhere?

1141
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:52,875
Excuse me?

1142
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:01,249
Only one person knows about
this alarm apart from me.

1143
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:02,750
No, you can't mean that, Manzi.

1144
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:05,874
You're going after my money.

1145
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:07,750
No, how could I do that?

1146
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,374
It's you, you son of a bitch.

1147
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:11,625
- No! No!
- Are you fucking with me, you asshole?

1148
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:13,750
He's going to kill him, man.

1149
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:17,874
Tell me the truth
or I'll shoot you, motherfucker!

1150
01:14:17,875 --> 01:14:19,499
No! I swear! I didn't do anything.

1151
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,749
This is my job, this is...

1152
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:23,624
This is what I do for a living,
alarms, security!

1153
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:25,750
- You fucking with me?
- No, no, no.

1154
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,249
Please relax, I beg of you.

1155
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:32,874
Look, if you want, I'll look
at the whole installation for free.

1156
01:14:32,875 --> 01:14:35,875
No cost, I'll pay for it, okay?

1157
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:40,875
God fucking damn it!

1158
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,249
He's crazy, man.

1159
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,750
This guy's crazy.

1160
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:56,750
Forgive me.

1161
01:14:58,125 --> 01:14:59,875
I've had some stressful days.

1162
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,125
- Forgive me.
- Yes, yes.

1163
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:05,999
I assure you the alarms are good.

1164
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,999
I've installed more than 100
of those alarms and they work.

1165
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,374
If you want
we can go to the utility pole.

1166
01:15:11,375 --> 01:15:13,124
And we can check the cable.

1167
01:15:13,125 --> 01:15:14,375
Okay?

1168
01:15:16,375 --> 01:15:17,375
Yes.

1169
01:15:17,376 --> 01:15:18,500
Good.

1170
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:22,375
Forgive me.

1171
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:24,375
Forgive me.

1172
01:15:44,125 --> 01:15:46,125
No, the box is fine.

1173
01:15:47,625 --> 01:15:49,750
The device has a complex circuit.

1174
01:15:50,375 --> 01:15:51,624
And here in this area

1175
01:15:51,625 --> 01:15:53,750
the electricity isn't very stable.

1176
01:15:55,625 --> 01:15:58,750
Maybe with some voltage variance

1177
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:04,125
the battery sensor resets
and makes the alarm go off.

1178
01:16:05,375 --> 01:16:08,499
I'd have to take the device
back to Buenos Aires

1179
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,374
for the technicians
to take a look at it.

1180
01:16:10,375 --> 01:16:11,624
But...

1181
01:16:11,625 --> 01:16:14,249
you'd be without an alarm
for two weeks.

1182
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:15,625
No, that won't happen.

1183
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:18,625
Well...

1184
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,250
The other option is...

1185
01:16:21,625 --> 01:16:23,500
to disconnect the battery.

1186
01:16:23,875 --> 01:16:26,374
And if the problem
is the battery sensor,

1187
01:16:26,375 --> 01:16:27,500
it won't go off anymore.

1188
01:16:29,625 --> 01:16:31,125
Maybe it's a bug?

1189
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,749
A machine touched the cable?

1190
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:36,124
No, if that were the case
it wouldn't restore itself.

1191
01:16:36,125 --> 01:16:38,125
I think it's a problem
with the electricity.

1192
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:41,750
Okay.

1193
01:16:42,125 --> 01:16:43,285
I'll call again if I need to.

1194
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,125
Okay.

1195
01:16:49,875 --> 01:16:52,749
He was this close
to shooting Seoane's head off.

1196
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:53,875
Yeah.

1197
01:16:54,875 --> 01:16:56,999
But he was worried

1198
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,250
or he wouldn't have called him
right there.

1199
01:17:00,625 --> 01:17:02,249
Do you think Manzi has a flip phone?

1200
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:03,499
What are you talking about?

1201
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,749
Of course he does,
he's rolling in money.

1202
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:08,124
- Wouldn't you have one?
- Of course, they're my favorite.

1203
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:10,125
Guys, guys, this is serious.

1204
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,000
This guy is dangerous,
he's hardcore.

1205
01:17:13,875 --> 01:17:17,375
Well, I'm used to dealing
with hardcore men and it doesn't scare me.

1206
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,500
What about you, guys?

1207
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
I'm in.

1208
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:26,624
Let's continue?

1209
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:28,250
- Yes.
- Yes.

1210
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,124
Okay, so then

1211
01:17:31,125 --> 01:17:34,249
we need to get him
to disconnect the battery,

1212
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:36,375
and for that,
we gotta make him go crazy.

1213
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:40,125
But completely crazy.

1236
01:20:19,125 --> 01:20:21,749
Running the National Roadway camp?

1237
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:26,999
Waking up each morning proud of the work
we're doing without stealing a dime?

1238
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,250
Having a happy family?

1239
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:31,500
You know what? I don't.

1240

I don't miss any of that.

1242
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,375
There it is.

1243
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,499
Are you kidding me?

1244
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,499
We're not.

1245
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,250
Come on, Fermín.
Let me show you, come on.

1246
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,125
The cherry on top of the cake.

1247
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:21,500
Ninety kilos of dynamite.

1248
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,999
- Well?
- Forget about it, I can't do this.

1249
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,249
You have to, do you want that son
of a bitch to catch us red handed?

1250
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:38,499
- I understand, but do you?
- I understand, but we need it.

1251
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:42,749
- It's ancient.
- So is <i>Peronismo</i>, but it still lives on.

1252
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:45,999
We'll leave you two alone,
you understand each other. Let's go.

1253
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,249
You're the best.

1254
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:48,750
Don't forget it.

1255
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:54,749
I'm going to the bathroom,
be right back.

1256
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:56,000
Okay.

1257
01:22:09,125 --> 01:22:10,500
Tell me what's going on.

1258
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,250
What's going on with what?

1259
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:16,125
Do you think I'm stupid?

1260
01:22:17,125 --> 01:22:20,875
Ever since you showed up here my boss has
been running around because of an alarm.

1261
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:23,250
And I know more about plants than you.

1262
01:22:23,875 --> 01:22:25,875
So tell me what's going on.

1263
01:22:29,125 --> 01:22:33,250
You can either tell me now
or I can tell all of this to my boss.

1264
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,125
Hello?

1265
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:40,625
It's your call.

1266
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:45,124
- Counselor? A word.
- Not now.

1267
01:22:45,125 --> 01:22:46,750
- No, counselor...
- No!

1268
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,125
He's on his way.

1269
01:23:02,375 --> 01:23:03,874
Fortunato Manzi,

1270
01:23:03,875 --> 01:23:05,250
your boss,

1271
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:07,250
is a monster.

1272
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:09,750
A son of a bitch.

1273
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,999
Manzi had a deal with Alvarado,

1274
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,499
who knew the crisis was coming
and gave your boss a loan

1275
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:19,875
with all of the dollars at the bank
the Friday before everything went to shit.

1276
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:21,750
All of the dollars.

1277
01:23:22,125 --> 01:23:23,749
Hundreds of thousands.

1278
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:25,999
My family's, your family's.

1279
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,875
An entire group we'd gotten together
to make a cooperative. Everyone's!

1280
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:33,375
And you want to steal it.

1281
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,125
We don't want to steal anything.

1282
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,375
We're not thieves.

1283
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:39,875
Hey.

1284
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:43,625
We want to get back what's ours.

1285
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
And your family's too, if you want.

1286
01:23:48,375 --> 01:23:49,750
No. I don't want to.

1287
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:52,124
I don't want to know anything.
Please leave.

1288
01:23:52,125 --> 01:23:53,875
Wait, listen to me for a second.

1289
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,000
We lost everything.

1290
01:24:03,875 --> 01:24:05,125
I lost my mom.

1291
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:08,500
In an accident.

1292
01:24:08,875 --> 01:24:10,500
Because of these assholes.

1293
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,500
They ruined all of our lives.

1294
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:19,250
I want the cooperative to happen.

1295
01:24:21,375 --> 01:24:23,375
Because that was my mom's dream.

1296
01:24:26,375 --> 01:24:27,875
That's all I want.

1297
01:24:34,125 --> 01:24:35,375
And my name isn't Miguel,

1298
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:37,500
my name is Rodrigo.

1299
01:25:15,125 --> 01:25:16,000
What happened?

1300
01:25:16,001 --> 01:25:21,750
Nothing, a medium voltage transformer
broke but we're fixing it.

1301
01:25:22,375 --> 01:25:23,874
And the power is out everywhere?

1302
01:25:23,875 --> 01:25:25,874
No, no, the problem is here.

1303
01:25:25,875 --> 01:25:30,124
Villagrán, Alsina,
that whole area has power.

1304
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,874
The problem is from here and out.

1305
01:25:32,875 --> 01:25:34,124
- From here and out.
- But...

1306
01:25:34,125 --> 01:25:35,999
It should be fixed soon.

1307
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,999
How are you doing over there?

1308
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,250
We're almost, almost ready.

1309
01:25:40,625 --> 01:25:41,749
Okay, yeah.

1310
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:44,750
Yeah, it'll be ready soon, doc.

1311
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:49,375
Do you know me?

1312
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,250
No, why?

1313
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:53,150
How do you know I have a doctorate?

1314
01:25:54,125 --> 01:25:56,124
Oh no, the thing is

1315
01:25:56,125 --> 01:25:59,500
someone with a car like this
has to at least be a doctor...

1316
01:26:02,125 --> 01:26:03,250
Okay.

1317
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
- Thank you.
- Bye, and sorry for the inconvenience.

1318
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:19,250
- Hello.
- Hello.

1319
01:26:19,625 --> 01:26:22,999
Connect everything and get out of there
because he's on his way.

1320
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
We got him.

1321
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:26,374
- We got him.
- A hug, comrade.

1322
01:26:26,375 --> 01:26:28,500
Comrade my ass.

1323
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:33,499
- Is it dangerous for Manzi to go there?
- No, on the contrary, it's much better.

1324
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:37,000
He has to find everything
in perfect shape and working.

1325
01:26:37,375 --> 01:26:39,500
We already know
he disconnected the battery.

1326
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:45,750
I couldn't do anything else,
I'm sorry.

1327
01:26:46,125 --> 01:26:47,999
She confronted me
and I didn't know how to act.

1328
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,125
You didn't have a choice, son.
That's it.

1329
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:54,249
- What do we do now?
- Nothing.

1330
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:57,124
Nothing, stop messing around
and call it quits.

1331
01:26:57,125 --> 01:26:58,375
Fermín.

1332
01:26:58,875 --> 01:27:01,375
We got him to disconnect the battery.

1333
01:27:02,125 --> 01:27:04,999
All we have to do is wait
for the storm, we're almost there.

1334
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,624
Almost where, Antonio? Think.

1335
01:27:07,625 --> 01:27:09,250
At ending up worse off?

1336
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,374
The girl knows everything!

1337
01:27:11,375 --> 01:27:13,374
She probably told Manzi
everything by now.

1338
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:15,374
What does she know?

1339
01:27:15,375 --> 01:27:16,874
What is she going to tell him?

1340
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:19,124
That there's a guy named Rodrigo

1341
01:27:19,125 --> 01:27:21,499
who wants to get back
what they stole from him.

1342
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:22,624
Nothing else!

1343
01:27:22,625 --> 01:27:25,125
- Nothing else?
- So what if she tells Manzi?

1344
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,250
What is he going to do,
call the police?

1345
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,750
Worst case, he takes the money
out of the vault.

1346
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:32,750
She heard me, dad.

1347
01:27:33,125 --> 01:27:34,375
I know she heard me.

1348
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,999
I could go back and try
to figure out if she said anything.

1349
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,750
You're never stepping foot in there again!
We've talked about this already, Rodrigo.

1350
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:43,499
Don't you understand?

1351
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,000
It's over!

1352
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:47,750
I lost my wife.

1353
01:27:48,250 --> 01:27:49,500
I'm not going to lose my son.

1354
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
It's over.

1355
01:27:52,001 --> 01:27:53,500
There's nothing else to discuss.

1356
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,999
You saw the storm
that's rolling in, right?

1357
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,374
I don't know what you want for dinner,

1358
01:28:32,375 --> 01:28:36,749
but there's some left over roast beef.
I can make some fries, a salad...

1359
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:39,375
Hey. Florencia isn't going
to say anything.

1360
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,250
How do you know?

1361
01:28:42,125 --> 01:28:45,250
- Manzi already knows everything. He does.
- No, no, listen to me.

1362
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:46,750
I was there.

1363
01:28:46,751 --> 01:28:49,499
When I told her everything
I got the feeling she understood.

1364
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,749
She's not going to rat us out, dad.
I saw it in her eyes.

1365
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:53,249
What are you talking about?

1366
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:55,124
You don't know her.
How long have you known her?

1367
01:28:55,125 --> 01:28:57,750
What did you see in her eyes?
Explain it to me!

1368
01:28:58,375 --> 01:28:59,499
Manzi knows everything!

1369
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:01,124
He probably already emptied the vault.

1370
01:29:01,125 --> 01:29:02,999
Think! It makes no sense.

1371
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,500
It's a miracle
they didn't recognize you!

1372
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,500
What are you doing here?

1373
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:11,750
You should be in La Plata studying
with your friends, give it a break!

1374
01:29:12,875 --> 01:29:13,999
Look at me.

1375
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,375
Forget about all of this.

1376
01:29:16,375 --> 01:29:17,500
Listen to me.

1377
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,250
Want me to fill the tank?

1378
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:45,750
Fermín...

1379
01:29:45,751 --> 01:29:49,125
Antonio, we've talked about it.
Case closed.

1380
01:29:50,125 --> 01:29:51,125
Fermín.

1381
01:29:51,625 --> 01:29:54,250
We understand.
Don't come and it's fine,

1382
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:58,749
- but we're doing it anyways.
- Do whatever you want, don't count us in.

1383
01:29:58,750 --> 01:29:59,999
Count me in.

1384
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,375
I'm going.

1385
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:03,624
I'm not backing out.

1386
01:30:03,625 --> 01:30:05,125
I'm in it until the end.

1387
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:07,375
Let's go.

1388
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:42,750
Let's give a warm welcome

1389
01:30:43,125 --> 01:30:46,749
to María Gabriela and Juan Carlos!

1390
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:50,375
With this applause we tell you
how much we care about you,

1391
01:30:50,875 --> 01:30:52,499
how much we love you.

1392
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:55,124
On this unforgettable night,

1393
01:30:55,125 --> 01:30:58,874
which we will all treasure forever

1394
01:30:58,875 --> 01:31:00,500
in our hearts.

1395
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,249
Didn't your dad say
the blowtorch was enough?

1396
01:31:25,250 --> 01:31:26,499
We agreed to take everything.

1397
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:29,000
He said we should travel light
because of the mud.

1398
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:31,000
We're taking everything.

1399
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:34,249
Why are we taking everything?
Weren't two sticks enough?

1400
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:38,249
Perlassi says we should dump the leftovers
in the lake so there's no evidence.

1401
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:39,750
Let the engine run!

1402
01:31:41,125 --> 01:31:43,000
And don't touch the pedal.

1403
01:31:50,125 --> 01:31:54,125
The <i>Peronista</i> men!

1404
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:57,125
Come on, guys!

1405
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:04,874
It's my dad...

1406
01:32:04,875 --> 01:32:06,375
It's my dad!

1407
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,375
Perlassi, yes man!

1408
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:20,874
You said you were going
to see it through.

1409
01:32:20,875 --> 01:32:22,500
I'm with you.

1410
01:32:36,125 --> 01:32:38,499
- That guy's awesome.
- Listen, listen to me.

1411
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:41,125
- He knows what's up.
- Please, please listen to me.

1412
01:32:42,125 --> 01:32:43,499
Wait for my call,

1413
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,124
if for some reason

1414
01:32:45,125 --> 01:32:48,124
we can't talk,
the phones don't work or whatever,

1415
01:32:48,125 --> 01:32:51,374
send up the flare,
that's the sign for us to go in.

1416
01:32:51,375 --> 01:32:52,624
- Understood?
- Understood.

1417
01:32:52,625 --> 01:32:55,224
- Do we all know what we have to do?
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

1418
01:32:55,225 --> 01:32:56,500
Okay, let's go! Let's go!

1419
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:44,999
Come on, Medina!

1420
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,999
Leave a long fuse
so we can get out of here, okay?

1421
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,500
Yeah! Calm down man, fuck.

1422
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:56,000
- Ready!
- No way we're getting stuck with this.

1423
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Guys!

1424
01:34:58,001 --> 01:34:59,500
- Let's unload everything.
- Okay.

1425
01:35:01,625 --> 01:35:03,375
We're ready over here.

1426
01:35:03,875 --> 01:35:04,875
Okay, okay.

1427
01:35:04,876 --> 01:35:07,000
I'm going to wait for Fontana's warning.

1428
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:17,750
Wait for me!

1429
01:35:17,751 --> 01:35:19,249
Don't fuck around!
What are you doing?

1430
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:20,999
I'm testing it!
Which one is number three?

1431
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,125
It's the one in the middle, that one!

1432
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:25,500
Hello?

1433
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,125
Antonio?

1434
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,124
Hello? Hello? Hello?

1435
01:35:30,125 --> 01:35:33,250
My part is done!

1436
01:35:34,125 --> 01:35:35,125
Bye!

1437
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:40,000
Rolo? Do it.

1438
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,500
- Let's go, Medina!
- Let's go, let's go!

1439
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:56,250
Send it to the middle one!

1440
01:36:01,125 --> 01:36:04,374
Down the middle!
Down the fucking middle!

1441
01:36:04,375 --> 01:36:06,624
No, no! It does whatever it wants!
I can't!

1442
01:36:06,625 --> 01:36:09,499
- Control the damn thing!
- It does whatever it wants!

1443
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:11,750
No, no, no!

1444
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:19,500
God fucking damn it!

1445
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:23,374
The electricity from the machinery
is interfering with it!

1446
01:36:23,375 --> 01:36:25,250
- It didn't work, let's go!
- No!

1447
01:36:26,125 --> 01:36:27,249
It has to be now.

1448
01:36:27,250 --> 01:36:28,750
And what are we going to do?

1449
01:36:29,375 --> 01:36:31,625
We're going to do things seriously,
Medina.

1450
01:36:43,625 --> 01:36:45,000
Turn it on, Medina!

1451
01:36:47,375 --> 01:36:48,750
Ready!

1452
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,624
Run, Medina!

1453
01:37:01,625 --> 01:37:02,750
Run!

1454
01:37:12,250 --> 01:37:14,249
No answer, no flare.
What the hell is going on?

1455
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:15,875
I don't know, I don't know.

1456
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,375
- Holy shit!
- What is that?

1457
01:37:35,125 --> 01:37:38,250
- The flare?
- There's no way that's the flare.

1458
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:43,750
What happened?

1459
01:37:45,125 --> 01:37:46,749
Something bad happened!

1460
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:48,000
What do we do?

1461
01:37:50,375 --> 01:37:53,499
This is an alert from alarm UK16-VE.

1462
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:55,000
Did something happen, honey?

1463
01:37:56,125 --> 01:37:58,125
No, no. Everything's fine.

1464
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:02,000
What are we going to do?

1465
01:38:03,125 --> 01:38:04,375
We go in anyways.

1466
01:38:04,875 --> 01:38:06,624
- Let's go.
- Let's go! Let's go!

1467
01:38:06,625 --> 01:38:07,625
Come on! Let's go!

1468
01:38:11,125 --> 01:38:12,375
Do you know what happened?

1469
01:38:12,875 --> 01:38:15,374
They're already calling
the electric company.

1470
01:38:15,375 --> 01:38:17,815
It must have been a lightning strike.
It happens all the time.

1471
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:20,625
What's going on?

1472
01:38:22,125 --> 01:38:23,625
He says it's a lightning strike.

1473
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:47,000
They're saying
there's a blackout in Rufino too.

1474
01:38:48,125 --> 01:38:50,000
- What do you mean in Rufino?
- Yes.

1475
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:54,750
Well then this can't be
because of a lightning strike.

1476
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:13,499
- Hello?
- Vázquez, it's Manzi.

1477
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:15,374
How are you, counselor?

1478
01:39:15,375 --> 01:39:16,999
I'm fine, the power is out.

1479
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,249
What happened?
A lightning strike?

1480
01:39:19,250 --> 01:39:22,124
No, what lightning strike?
This was intentional.

1481
01:39:22,125 --> 01:39:24,124
They blew everything up.

1482
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:27,500
I've never seen anything like it,
the whole station's destroyed.

1483
01:39:28,375 --> 01:39:29,375
Where are you going?

1484
01:40:09,375 --> 01:40:10,875
Holy shit.

1485
01:40:15,750 --> 01:40:18,374
The amount of people
this asshole screwed over.

1486
01:40:18,375 --> 01:40:20,625
- Come on, Perlassi!
- Let's go!

1487
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:40,500
The other one.

1488
01:40:40,501 --> 01:40:42,499
- The other one.
- Come on, let's go!

1489
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:44,499
- One minute!
- Come on! Let's go, Perlassi!

1490
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:45,750
Almost done!

1491
01:40:48,875 --> 01:40:50,125
God damn it!

1492
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:51,500
Take it.

1493
01:40:53,375 --> 01:40:54,499
Help me!

1494
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:56,000
Come on! Let's go!

1495
01:40:58,125 --> 01:40:59,250
Careful!

1496
01:41:04,125 --> 01:41:05,500
Let's go!

1497
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Come on, man! Let's go!

1498
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:54,750
Manzi.

1499
01:41:54,751 --> 01:41:56,374
It's Manzi. Manzi's coming!

1500
01:41:56,375 --> 01:41:57,500
Manzi!

1501
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:16,875
Let's go!

1502
01:42:29,375 --> 01:42:31,375
Motherfuckers!

1503
01:43:18,375 --> 01:43:19,750
We did it!

1504
01:43:20,375 --> 01:43:21,874
I can't believe it!

1505
01:43:21,875 --> 01:43:23,625
You're alive!

1506
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:24,875
How did it go?

1507
01:43:24,876 --> 01:43:27,375
- We did it. We did it.
- We did it!

1508
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,124
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1509
01:43:31,125 --> 01:43:32,500
Calm down, calm down.

1510
01:43:33,625 --> 01:43:34,874
Let's not lose time.

1511
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:36,874
Let's split up, just in case. Okay?

1512
01:43:36,875 --> 01:43:37,875
We'll take a bag.

1513
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:41,249
- Hernán, take the other one to your mom.
- Got it, got it.

1514
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:43,249
- Who's coming with me?
- Gómez, take Medina.

1515
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:45,124
- Rolo, you're coming with us.
- Let's go, let's go!

1516
01:43:45,125 --> 01:43:46,749
Move! Come on!

1517
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:48,500
Be careful, don't waste time. Let's go.

1518
01:43:53,375 --> 01:43:55,000
Take this one.

1519
01:44:01,125 --> 01:44:02,000
We did it!

1520
01:44:02,001 --> 01:44:03,375
Good job kid, good job.

1521
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:29,624
No!

1522
01:44:29,625 --> 01:44:31,750
No! Motherfuckers!

1523
01:44:32,125 --> 01:44:34,000
Motherfuckers!

1524
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:37,375
No!

1525
01:44:38,125 --> 01:44:39,375
No!

1526
01:44:40,375 --> 01:44:41,625
No!

1527
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:44,500
Motherfuckers!

1528
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:46,875
No!

1529
01:45:15,375 --> 01:45:16,875
How much did he take?

1530
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:21,500
We're not sure, but...

1531
01:45:22,375 --> 01:45:25,250
There were about
two million dollars in that bag.

1532
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:31,375
Carmen.

1533
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:36,375
I don't know, maybe...

1534
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:38,875
He'll think it through and...

1535
01:45:40,125 --> 01:45:41,375
He'll come back.

1536
01:45:44,750 --> 01:45:46,125
He's not coming back.

1537
01:45:50,625 --> 01:45:52,249
Carmen was right.

1538
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:54,125
Hernán never came back.

1539
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:00,125
The Methodical reopened its doors
on September 14 of 2003,

1540
01:46:01,250 --> 01:46:03,375
the day of Lidia's birthday,

1541
01:46:04,125 --> 01:46:07,125
and gave jobs to 57 people.

1542
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,250
We donated the rest,
like we'd agreed.

1543
01:46:13,625 --> 01:46:15,750
Our dreams came true.

1544
01:46:16,875 --> 01:46:18,499
The big ones,

1545
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:20,499
and the others.

1546
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:21,874
Hello?

1547
01:46:21,875 --> 01:46:23,375
Hey...

1548
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:25,750
- Hello, José?
- How are you, Eladio?

1549
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:34,000
The truth is,
this story changed all of our lives.

1550
01:46:36,250 --> 01:46:37,750
Forever.

1551
01:46:45,125 --> 01:46:48,000
Now, I think being a fool
isn't so bad.

1552
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:51,499
Because what no one tells you,

1553
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:53,624
not even the dictionary,

1554
01:46:53,625 --> 01:46:57,124
is that fools are people
who learned to get back up

1555
01:46:57,125 --> 01:46:59,125
over and over again.

1556
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:02,875
To never give up.

1557
01:47:05,375 --> 01:47:06,875
Never.

1558
01:47:21,250 --> 01:47:28,375
HEROIC LOSERS

1559
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:00,500
- Kid.
- What do you need?

1560
01:48:01,125 --> 01:48:03,500
- Fix my tire, please.
- Yes.

1561
01:48:34,625 --> 01:48:36,250
Care for some <i>Maté</i>?

1562
01:48:41,875 --> 01:48:42,875
Thank you.

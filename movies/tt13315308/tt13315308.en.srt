You know, you just don't...

that this turned into

a real family and not work.

82
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,926

We had a really fast family.

Oh, I read about you somewhere.

about the pilot?

117
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,500
What are your memories?

It didn't matter.

136
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,874
- I came out,

137
00:06:13,914 --> 00:06:15,114
I'm saying my stuff.

138
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,100
I'm trying to get through

139
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:18,080
and do... just do my thing

140
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,080
and keep it together,

141
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,141
and you mouthed lines...

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,080
All rehearsal you never did it.

146
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,080
- I don't... okay.

147
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,568
- All rehearsal,

148
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:28,080
you never did it.

149
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,144
The night in front

150
00:06:29,184 --> 00:06:30,080
of the audience,

151
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,049
you looked up at me and went...

152
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:31,120
d

153
00:06:31,121 --> 00:06:32,994
- And I was just going

154
00:06:33,034 --> 00:06:33,080
d

155
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,648
- You did it to me too.

156
00:06:33,688 --> 00:06:34,768
- I did it to you.

157
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,080
- And I was a nervous wreck,

158
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,262
and I was like, "Oh, my God!"

159
00:06:37,286 --> 00:06:38,080
- All right, so wait.

160
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,080
So my side of that was

161
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,361
when we were on the set

162
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,080
of the pilot,

163
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,884
that was my first time,

164
00:06:43,924 --> 00:06:46,080
like, really doing dialogue.

165
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,448
- So you did

166
00:06:46,488 --> 00:06:47,748
everybody's dialogue?

167
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,080
- I learned everybody's.

168
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,080
So it's on the episode.

169
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,177
You can see it on the episodes.

170
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:53,080
- Oh, yeah, you can see it.

171
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,766
- I saw one episode, though,

172
00:06:54,806 --> 00:06:56,080
where you're standing,

173
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,022
like, behind the couch

174
00:06:57,062 --> 00:06:58,080
in the living room scene.

175
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,080
- Yeah?

176
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,534
- And it's you

177
00:06:59,574 --> 00:07:00,080
and whoever else.

178
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,080
- Was that Don Cheadle?

179
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,080
- Tray!

180
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,901
- Prince!

181
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:06,080
Homey, homey!

182
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,124
- They literally had to show

183
00:07:09,148 --> 00:07:10,080
me, and I was like.

184
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,088
- That's the one that was like,

185
00:07:12,128 --> 00:07:14,080
"Okay, we need to change this."

186
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,820
- You don't go to school,

187
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,080
Ice Tray?

188
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,002
- Oh, sure I do.

189
00:07:16,042 --> 00:07:17,080
I've been held back

190
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,468
in the tenth grade

191
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:20,080
three times in a row.

192
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,080
- Three times?

193
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,080
- Yeah, see, my motto is

194
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,969
when I find a grade I like,

195
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:26,100
I stick with it.

196
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,080
I stick with it.

197
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,144
- That's terrible.

198
00:07:32,184 --> 00:07:33,080
That's terrible.

199
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,969
Oh, wow.

200
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:37,080
Oh, that's painful to watch.

201
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,532
- She was so ugly that

202
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:40,080
Freddy Krueger used to have

203
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,080
nightmares about her.

204
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,560
- Was it the fifth episode

205
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,080
when you finally had enough

206
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,252
and you were like...

207
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:48,080
'cause I remember in rehears...

208
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,853
She just looked

209
00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:50,333
and she said, "Stop it!"

210
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,080
I knew everybody's lines.

211
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,885
I would have

212
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:56,080
played Uncle Phil.

213
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,080
I could have played Aunt Viv.

214
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,925
I was... I knew

215
00:07:57,965 --> 00:07:59,080
everybody's words.

216
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,840
Does anybody remember

217
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,080
their audition?

218
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,895
- I mean, I remember

219
00:08:02,935 --> 00:08:04,095
very little of it, obviously,

220
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,080
but, like, I do remember...

221
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,983
- Oh, no.

222
00:08:08,023 --> 00:08:09,080
- Oh! Ohhh!

223
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,344
- Alfonso Ribeiro.

224
00:08:10,384 --> 00:08:12,080
- You're ten, you're ten.

225
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,086
- Whoo!

226
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,080
- Okay.

227
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,371
What am I wearing?

228
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,207
What have you been

229
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,080
doing in here?

230
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,080
- Just maxing and relaxing.

231
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,280
- I meant what have you been

232
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,080
doing to this room?

233
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,587
- Oh, I'm trying to make it

234
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:27,080
a little more.

235
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,080
Malcolm X, he's my hero.

236
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,740
- Well, he was a great man.

237
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,989
I don't know if I'd call him

238
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:34,080
my hero exactly.

239
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,928
- Whoa. Wow.

240
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:36,080
d

241
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,835
- All right,

242
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,080
first, I would say...

243
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,122
- No, no, we're gonna give

244
00:08:39,146 --> 00:08:40,080
that a moment of silence!

245
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,080
- Okay, yes.

246
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,179
I know I didn't go there

247
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:44,080
wearing a sweat suit

248
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,819
believing that I was gonna

249
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,080
get that character.

250
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,462
I don't know

251
00:08:47,502 --> 00:08:48,080
what I was thinking.

252
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,858
I don't know

253
00:08:48,898 --> 00:08:50,080
how I got that job.

254
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,652
- You know what thought...

255
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:51,692
- That dude sucked!

256
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:53,080
- No, no.

257
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,080
- No.

258
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,716
- You are so much fun to watch.

259
00:08:55,756 --> 00:08:57,080
- Yeah, I wanna watch you.

260
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,274
- With everything you do.

261
00:08:58,314 --> 00:08:59,080
- Thank goodness.

262
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,002
I guess somewhere along

263
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:03,080
the line people were able

264
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,537
to see the magic

265
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:07,080
that I clearly couldn't see.

266
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,181
- Do you remember

267
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:09,080
your audition?

268
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,734
- They had me audition

269
00:09:09,774 --> 00:09:10,774
in New York,

270
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,414
and I remember my mom and

271
00:09:12,454 --> 00:09:14,080
my aunties being really excited

272
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,274
because I was auditioning

273
00:09:15,314 --> 00:09:16,080
for Quincy Jones.

274
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,080
That was my second call.

275
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,730
- Mm-hmm.

276
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:18,080
- Oh.

277
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,080
- And they had me rap,

278
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,080
but they had the kids,

279
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,774
like, last-minute,

280
00:09:22,814 --> 00:09:24,100
make up a rap.

281
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,080
- A rap?

282
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,700
- Like, I can sing.

283
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,080
I can't rap.

284
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,138
Like, that's a whole

285
00:09:28,178 --> 00:09:29,178
'nother skill set.

286
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,080
d

287
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,819
And I guess I was probably

288
00:09:42,859 --> 00:09:44,080
so corny and so bad

289
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,080
that that's probably why...

290
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,080
- That's perfect!

291
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,642
- I remember thinking, like,

292
00:09:48,682 --> 00:09:50,080
"This is really horrible."

293
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,731
- Do you remember

294
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:53,080
your audition?

295
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,487
No, I'm just...

296
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,080
I'm just asking.

297
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,657
Do you...

298
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:57,080
- Ahh!

299
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,080
- Karyn Parsons.

300
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,265
Lord, have mercy on me,

301
00:10:00,305 --> 00:10:01,305
oh, my goodness.

302
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,080
Dad, I need $300.

303
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,357
- Hilary, your cousin

304
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:06,080
Will's here.

305
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,080
- Hi.

306
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,080
Dad, I need $300.

307
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,962
Like, I'm going on the

308
00:10:10,002 --> 00:10:11,096
Save the Ozone celebrity bus

309
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,080
next Saturday,

310
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,848
and it's gonna be Bruce Willis

311
00:10:14,888 --> 00:10:16,080
and Demi and Rob Lowe

312
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,142
and Emilio Estevez

313
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:20,080
or Charlie Sheen,

314
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,080
I don't remember which.

315
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,604
- Wow.

316
00:10:22,644 --> 00:10:24,080
That's beautiful.

317
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,080
d

318
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,190
- I auditioned a lot.

319
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,080
- Did you really?

320
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,325
- I auditioned a lot,

321
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:31,080
and I remember the network one

322
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,080
because it was down to...

323
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,954
There were, like,

324
00:10:33,994 --> 00:10:35,080
you know, two Hilarys,

325
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,080
and I was so nervous,

326
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,417
and I caught my reflection

327
00:10:38,457 --> 00:10:39,080
in something,

328
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,086
and I remember I kinda

329
00:10:41,126 --> 00:10:43,080
started primping and...

330
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,501
And it was like,

331
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,080
I started feeling her.

332
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,665
She started, like,

333
00:10:47,705 --> 00:10:48,705
coming over...

334
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,692
- They're like, "You got it.

335
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,080
You got the role!"

336
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,716
- No, but you could

337
00:10:51,756 --> 00:10:53,080
absolutely see...

338
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,080
See the Hilary.

339
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,175
- That was Hilary.

340
00:10:55,215 --> 00:10:56,080
- Come to life.

341
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,087
Even as little as the way

342
00:10:58,127 --> 00:11:00,080
you held your bottom jaw.

343
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,600
- Yeah, yeah, it's like...

344
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,080
- Right?

345
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,486
Like, it was so just,

346
00:11:03,526 --> 00:11:04,080
like, ha.

347
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,931
- I'm in a bad mood, and

348
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:08,080
somebody is going to suffer.

349
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,191
- I didn't go to the audition

350
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:12,080
in 1990 because they said,

351
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,467
"Oh, we want you to audition

352
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,080
for this new sitcom

353
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,967
with a rapper."

354
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:18,080
I said, "Mm, pass."

355
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,915
I said, "Um, um,

356
00:11:22,955 --> 00:11:25,080
thank you, no, no."

357
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,541
And I left,

358
00:11:25,581 --> 00:11:26,080
and I watched

359
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,080
the show come on in September.

360
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,244
I said, "Oh, damn,

361
00:11:29,284 --> 00:11:30,284
that's cute."

362
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,661
- Got this whole town

363
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:34,080
of Bel-Air buzzing.

364
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,980
- Get a load of me

365
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,080
and my rapping cousin!

366
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,080
- Yeah, you know.

367
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,291
So Quincy Jones basically

368
00:11:41,331 --> 00:11:43,100
steamrolled me

369
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,080
through the whole process

370
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,478
without ever really

371
00:11:46,518 --> 00:11:48,080
auditioning me, right?

372
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,688
So the only kind of audition

373
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:52,080
I had was the...

374
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,100
Quincy's birthday.

375
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,080
The show was an idea.

376
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,977
Benny Medina had

377
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,080
pitched me the idea,

378
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,934
and it's like,

379
00:11:59,974 --> 00:12:01,080
I was making music,

380
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,968
and they were like,

381
00:12:02,008 --> 00:12:03,080
"Come to Quincy's house.

382
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,149
We have this idea

383
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:05,080
for a TV show."

384
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,080
I'm like, "Okay," you know?

385
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,080
- "I'll go to Quincy's."

386
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,080
So I got to Quincy's house,

387
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,587
and Benny Medina pitched me

388
00:12:12,627 --> 00:12:14,080
the whole idea of the show,

389
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,043
and he's like, you know,

390
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,096
"We have this... this idea,"

391
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,986
'cause it was based

392
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:18,080
on Benny Medina's life.

393
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,080
- His life, right.

394
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,623
- He went from Watts

395
00:12:20,663 --> 00:12:21,080
to Beverly Hills.

396
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,936
So I'm like, "Cool,"

397
00:12:21,976 --> 00:12:23,080
so we go to Quincy's house,

398
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,301
and Benny's like,

399
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:26,080
"Hey, you know, this is...

400
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,680
This is the Fresh Prince."

401
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,411
Quincy said,

402
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:29,080
"I know who that boy is.

403
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,051
I seen his stuff," you know?

404
00:12:30,091 --> 00:12:31,096
"Hey, come on in. Come on in."

405
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,080
So Quincy, it's his birthday.

406
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,061
He had been tasting

407
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:35,080
a little bit, right?

408
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,085
So he was... he was

409
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,080
wetting his beak.

410
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,080
He wet his beak, right?

411
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,434
So he... you know, he's like,

412
00:12:39,474 --> 00:12:40,080
"Come on in."

413
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,811
So we go in,

414
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:42,080
and he said... he said,

415
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,872
"Where you from?"

416
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:44,080
I said, "I'm from Philly."

417
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,417
He said, "Your character's

418
00:12:45,457 --> 00:12:46,080
from Philly."

419
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,967
"Oh."

420
00:12:47,007 --> 00:12:49,080
Like, "Okay.

421
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,260
Give me a glass of whatever

422
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,080
Quincy's drinking."

423
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,080
Right?

424
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,838
So it's like...

425
00:12:53,878 --> 00:12:55,080
It's Quincy's birthday,

426
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,534
so it's like...

427
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:56,080
It's a big party,

428
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,541
so everybody's in there,

429
00:12:57,581 --> 00:12:58,080
you know?

430
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,080
So it was Brandon Tartikoff,

431
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,080
who's the head of NBC,

432
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,310
Warren Littlefield,

433
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,080
all of that.

434
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,301
So everybody gets in the room,

435
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:06,080
and Quincy, he says,

436
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,403
"Hey!

437
00:13:06,443 --> 00:13:08,080
Clear the living room out!

438
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,122
Clear the living room out!

439
00:13:09,146 --> 00:13:10,080
We gonna do an audition."

440
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,049
- Oh, man.

441
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:13,080
- You like go, "Who?"

442
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,709
- Right, I'm saying,

443
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:14,080
"Who? Who..."

444
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,376
Yeah, "Who's gonna audition?"

445
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,080
And he was like,

446
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,941
"Yeah, you got it.

447
00:13:16,981 --> 00:13:18,080
You got it. You got it."

448
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,445
I said, "Q, Q, no, no,"

449
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:22,080
and he grabs me,

450
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,994
and he takes me

451
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:24,080
in the other room,

452
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,235
and he sits me down

453
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:26,080
in his office,

454
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,015
and there's a 48 million

455
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:31,080
"Thriller" thing.

456
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,080
There's a "Color Purple,"

457
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,804
and he sits me under this

458
00:13:35,844 --> 00:13:38,080
70 Grammys, you know,

459
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,724
this Em... and I'm sitting under

460
00:13:39,764 --> 00:13:41,080
all of that stuff, like...

461
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,141
And Michael's looking down

462
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:44,181
on me like...

463
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,080
So Quincy says,

464
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,473
"Okay, what do you need?"

465
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:51,080
and I said,

466
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,450
"Quincy, I'm the... I don't

467
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,080
know how to... I'm not an actor.

468
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,441
"I just... just give me

469
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:56,080
two weeks,

470
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,357
"Let me find an acting coach,

471
00:13:58,397 --> 00:14:00,080
and let me work on it,

472
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,241
and then let's just set up

473
00:14:01,281 --> 00:14:02,080
a proper audition."

474
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,142
He said, "Oh, so two weeks.

475
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,080
You only need two weeks?"

476
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,197
I said, "Yeah, yeah,

477
00:14:05,237 --> 00:14:06,080
just two weeks."

478
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,080
He said, "So here's the deal.

479
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,080
"Right now everybody

480
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,407
"that needs to say yes

481
00:14:11,447 --> 00:14:13,080
for this show is sitting out

482
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,328
in that living room

483
00:14:14,368 --> 00:14:16,080
right now waiting for you."

484
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,080
- It's now.

485
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,080
- And I was like...

486
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,085
I was like,

487
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,080
"Give me ten minutes."

488
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,141
And he's like, "All right!

489
00:14:23,165 --> 00:14:24,080
Audition in ten minutes!

490
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,080
Audition in ten minutes!"

491
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,080
- Far out.

492
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,752
- They did a deal memo

493
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:29,080
that night.

494
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,781
That's how we got

495
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:33,080
to the pilot that fast.

496
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,604
- Whoa.

497
00:14:33,644 --> 00:14:35,080
- How is it possible

498
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,029
I've known you this long

499
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:37,096
and never heard that story?

500
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,445
- I know.

501
00:14:37,485 --> 00:14:38,080
- I know, right?

502
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,144
- Do you remember,

503
00:14:39,184 --> 00:14:40,080
we were on tour?

504
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,080
- We were in Detroit, yep.

505
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,058
- We were on tour

506
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:43,080
and had a day off.

507
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,447
- Yep.

508
00:14:43,487 --> 00:14:45,080
- And Will flew and came...

509
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,671
- To go to

510
00:14:45,711 --> 00:14:47,080
"The Arsenio Hall Show."

511
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,336
- And said, "I got a TV show."

512
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,624
Being from Philly,

513
00:14:52,664 --> 00:14:54,080
"I got a TV show"

514
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,950
was a homeboy

515
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,080
with a camcorder.

516
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,445
No one thought anything

517
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:00,080
other than that.

518
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,602
- It was probably

519
00:15:00,642 --> 00:15:01,080
six weeks later,

520
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,709
we were on the set, right?

521
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:03,749
- Wow.

522
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,180
- Okay, Will, just come

523
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,080
downstage a little.

524
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,853
Okay, actually,

525
00:15:06,893 --> 00:15:08,080
no, you're fine, and go.

526
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,417
- I remember

527
00:15:09,457 --> 00:15:12,080
our first table reading.

528
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,315
Will and Alfonso

529
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:15,080
were chasing each other

530
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,080
around the table.

531
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,236
There were network executives

532
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,580
and all kinds of thi...

533
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:23,360
You know,

534
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,080
really powerful people,

535
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,704
and they were just playmates

536
00:15:25,744 --> 00:15:27,184
from the very beginning.

537
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,080
- Look who's here, Will.

538
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,080
- Hey!

539
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,080
Who is he?

540
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,424
- One of the things I've always

541
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:38,080
been able to recognize

542
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,541
in my life is chemistry.

543
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:40,581
- Mm-hmm.

544
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,181
- And that really came alive

545
00:15:43,221 --> 00:15:44,080
on the show,

546
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,895
the comedic relationship

547
00:15:45,935 --> 00:15:48,080
that we were able to develop.

548
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,895
The initial focus of

549
00:16:01,935 --> 00:16:04,100
the show was going to be

550
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,080
Will, Uncle Phil collisions.

551
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,120
- Oh, my God.

552
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,695
- We started to see

553
00:16:10,735 --> 00:16:11,080
the dynamics

554
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,080
between the other characters,

555
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,080
and Uncle Phil, Aunt Viv

556
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,080
were holding the base,

557
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,941
and Will and Carlton

558
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,080
being able to run wild.

559
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,428
- Yo, how you playing me,

560
00:16:26,468 --> 00:16:27,080
Prince?

561
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,584
- What?

562
00:16:27,624 --> 00:16:29,080
- Yo, you dissin' me!

563
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,080
- C'mon, man, stop it!

564
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,080
It became clear very quickly

565
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,351
that that was the most powerful

566
00:16:36,391 --> 00:16:39,080
comedic asset of the show.

567
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,188
[The Sugarhill Gang's

568
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,122
- We understood that someone

569
00:16:49,162 --> 00:16:51,080
had to be the straight man.

570
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,941
- Yep, absolutely.

571
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:53,080
- For the other person's

572
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,319
silliness and comedy.

573
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:55,080
- Absolutely.

574
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
d

575
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,020
- It was never

576
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,080
as crystal clear

577
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,666
as "this is a Carlton moment,"

578
00:17:01,706 --> 00:17:03,080
or "this is a Will moment."

579
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,903
- Mm-hmm.

580
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:06,080
- It was always the show

581
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,080
that came first.

582
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,019
- I saved your life!

583
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:10,100
You owe me!

584
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,420
- We knew that we could rely

585
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,080
on each other,

586
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,986
and there was always

587
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:26,080
a respect and a trust.

588
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,260
Is that the police?

589
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,631
- Punch it, man.

590
00:17:29,671 --> 00:17:30,671
We in a Benz.

591
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,080
- Are you crazy?

592
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,080
I'd call this a lucky break.

593
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,391
A policeman is our pal.

594
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:36,080
We can ask him for directions.

595
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,885
The episode where Will

596
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:40,080
and Carlton get pulled over

597
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,080
made it abundantly clear that

598
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,087
Will came from the streets,

599
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:47,080
Carlton grew up in Bel-Air.

600
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,080
- Listen to me, Carlton.

601
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,192
When he comes up,

602
00:17:49,232 --> 00:17:51,080
keep your hands on the wheel.

603
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,348
- Good evening, officer.

604
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:53,080
Carlton Banks.

605
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,784
- Keep your hands

606
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,080
on the wheel.

607
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,229
- Culturally,

608
00:17:57,269 --> 00:17:59,080
we learned how to see

609
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,080
other people's points of view.

610
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,085
- Even when you make

611
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,080
fun of me,

612
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,029
I know you're doing it

613
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:07,100
out of love.

614
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,080
Influences change people.

615
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,080
Will learned from Carlton.

616
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,080
Carlton learned from Will.

617
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,080
You can't be the same kid

618
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
before Will

619
00:18:17,154 --> 00:18:19,080
comes into that house

620
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,172
and be the same kid

621
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:21,080
six years later.

622
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,994
Admit it, Will.

623
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,080
You care about me.

624
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,080
- I do not.

625
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,080
- You love me.

626
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,588
Hey, my brother,

627
00:18:28,628 --> 00:18:30,080
you wanna take this outside?

628
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,332
How about you do the Carlton

629
00:18:33,372 --> 00:18:34,080
dance real quick?

630
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,080
Do the Carlton dance.

631
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,816
- How about I don't

632
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:38,080
and say I did?

633
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,798
- I never, ever could do

634
00:18:39,838 --> 00:18:41,080
the Carlton dance.

635
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,138
For whatever reason,

636
00:18:42,178 --> 00:18:43,080
I can't find the...

637
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,399
There's an opposite thing

638
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:45,080
that he does,

639
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,587
and I can't... I just never...

640
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:48,080
I never was able to get it.

641
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,301
- The first time,

642
00:18:49,341 --> 00:18:51,080
all it said in the script

643
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,460
was, "Carlton dances,"

644
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,080
and I needed to figure out

645
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,283
how this character

646
00:18:55,323 --> 00:18:56,080
would dance.

647
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,454
What would be the actual move

648
00:18:58,494 --> 00:19:00,080
that hit it perfect?

649
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,354
- You got to do it.

650
00:19:01,394 --> 00:19:03,080
One last time for me, man.

651
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,184
[Tom Jones'

652
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,627
- That final moment

653
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:14,080
doing it together,

654
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:14,967
that was, like,

655
00:19:15,007 --> 00:19:16,080
Will finally making

656
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,987
the full acceptance

657
00:19:18,027 --> 00:19:19,080
of Carlton,

658
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,948
and we are in sync

659
00:19:20,988 --> 00:19:22,080
and as one.

660
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,100
d

661
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,741
- We did six seasons

662
00:19:36,781 --> 00:19:39,080
and, you know, 150 episodes,

663
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,241
so it's like, finding

664
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:43,080
my favorite moment

665
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,080
is really hard.

666
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,613
This is a job

667
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:49,080
for Sherlock Homeboy.

668
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,418
- My favorite episode

669
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,080
is "Def Poet's Society."

670
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,557
- Ladies and gentlemen,

671
00:19:55,597 --> 00:19:57,080
Mr. Rafael de la Ghetto!

672
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,080
d

673
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,080
- The Rafael de la Ghetto

674
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,849
was fun for Joe

675
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:05,080
to break character.

676
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,080
- Cannons to the right of them!

677
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,080
- Cannons to the left of them.

678
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,080
Cannons in front of them.

679
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,080
Volleyed and thundered!

680
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,778
Talk about ham acting,

681
00:20:15,818 --> 00:20:17,080
that's brilliant.

682
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,539
- One of my most

683
00:20:18,579 --> 00:20:20,080
memorable moments

684
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,080
was in the first season

685
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,301
when you guys

686
00:20:23,341 --> 00:20:25,080
blackmailed Hilary.

687
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,080
d

688
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,197
I was really worried

689
00:20:28,237 --> 00:20:29,080
about how people

690
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,124
were gonna feel about Hilary

691
00:20:30,148 --> 00:20:31,080
all the time, and I'm like,

692
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,213
"They're just gonna hate her.

693
00:20:32,237 --> 00:20:33,080
They're gonna hate her.

694
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,318
They're gonna hate her,"

695
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,080
which was true,

696
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,087
and I found out

697
00:20:36,127 --> 00:20:38,080
just how much in that episode.

698
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,080
- That's awful.

699
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,120
Is he making you

700
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,080
clean his room?

701
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,638
- No.

702
00:20:41,678 --> 00:20:44,080
- Will you clean mine?

703
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,218
- Do you remember

704
00:20:48,258 --> 00:20:49,080
the audience?

705
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,516
- I do remember.

706
00:20:49,556 --> 00:20:50,816
- The audience, yeah.

707
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,931
- They started

708
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:53,080
stomping out there.

709
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,100
d

710
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,642
- Hilary!

711
00:21:01,682 --> 00:21:02,682
- Woof!

712
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,436
- A lot of sitcoms

713
00:21:06,476 --> 00:21:08,080
just had the...

714
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,643
You know,

715
00:21:08,683 --> 00:21:10,080
they had the laugh knob

716
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,650
that they would turn up,

717
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,080
and there were moments

718
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,152
on the show

719
00:21:14,192 --> 00:21:16,080
where we had to dial

720
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,080
the laughter back.

721
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,080
- Hilary Banks!

722
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,080
- Oh, yes, Trevor?

723
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,939
- Will you marry me?

724
00:21:23,979 --> 00:21:24,080
d

725
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,100
d

726
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,920
- The Trevor moment

727
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,080
was another one of those...

728
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,994
- Oh.

729
00:21:33,034 --> 00:21:34,080
- Yes.

730
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,441
- One of those

731
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:37,080
sustained laughs.

732
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,894
- I ain't no bungee expert

733
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,080
or nothing,

734
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,840
but I don't think

735
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,080
he's supposed to be slamming

736
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,080
into the ground like that.

737
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,357
- I had my first kiss

738
00:21:49,397 --> 00:21:50,080
on the show.

739
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,080
Like, my first actual kiss.

740
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,080
- I think I'd feel better

741
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,080
if I-I could kiss you.

742
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,080
d

743
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,080
- I was so nervous,

744
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,569
and we're about

745
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:02,080
to do the scene.

746
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,415
Is it terrible that

747
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,080
I want to kiss you back?

748
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,080
And I swear to you,

749
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,080
I see Alfonso, Will and Karyn

750
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,086
peek out from behind

751
00:22:11,126 --> 00:22:13,100
a camera like, "Oh."

752
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,080
- Can I blow in your ear?

753
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,080
d

754
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,766
- That was all so...

755
00:22:21,806 --> 00:22:23,080
Like, I was 11,

756
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,080
having, like, breakdown...

757
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,645
Like, "I don't know

758
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:26,080
what I'm doing.

759
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,866
I don't know how to do this,"

760
00:22:27,906 --> 00:22:29,080
because everything...

761
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,357
- Think of you doing that

762
00:22:31,397 --> 00:22:33,080
as an 11-year-old...

763
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,449
- You gotta act like

764
00:22:34,489 --> 00:22:36,080
you got this tic, right?

765
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,022
Like the Army did this

766
00:22:37,062 --> 00:22:38,080
experiment on you, right,

767
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,080
that just went terribly wrong.

768
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,885
You be like,

769
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:42,080
"Back up! Back up!

770
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,373
"Mind your business,

771
00:22:43,413 --> 00:22:44,080
that's all.

772
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,080
Mind your business."

773
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,080
Back up! Back up!

774
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,777
Mind your business, that's all.

775
00:22:51,817 --> 00:22:53,080
Just mind your business.

776
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,080
- That's good.

777
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,080
- Me getting tossed out

778
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,765
was written into

779
00:22:56,805 --> 00:22:58,080
the very first show that I did.

780
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,357
When it aired,

781
00:22:59,397 --> 00:23:01,080
everybody loved it.

782
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,080
- When do we eat here?

783
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,134
- We eat here later.

784
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,100
You eat here never.

785
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,855
- Looks like

786
00:23:07,895 --> 00:23:09,100
you eat here often.

787
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,080
Ahh!

788
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,717
One day we filmed maybe

789
00:23:19,757 --> 00:23:22,080
about 150 takes

790
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,164
of me getting tossed

791
00:23:23,204 --> 00:23:24,080
out of the house.

792
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,080
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

793
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,127
I think they didn't want

794
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:29,080
to torture me anymore,

795
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,116
so that's the reason why they

796
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:33,080
started using the same shot,

797
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,860
and then that became a thing,

798
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,414
that every time I walked

799
00:23:36,454 --> 00:23:37,080
into a scene

800
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,080
and I had that shirt on,

801
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,222
the audience kind of knew

802
00:23:40,262 --> 00:23:41,080
what was coming up.

803
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,080
- You know the drill.

804
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,080
- Uh-oh.

805
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,080
Ahh!

806
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,080
Ahh!

807
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,188
- My favorite moment,

808
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:50,080
I think...

809
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,654
I think... and there's

810
00:23:50,694 --> 00:23:51,080
so many things,

811
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,619
but one that comes to mind

812
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:54,080
right away of my favorite

813
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,080
is when you lost your mind

814
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,609
and dragged yourself

815
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:56,729
across that floor.

816
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,541
- Oh, my goodness.

817
00:23:57,581 --> 00:23:58,080
- That's my favorite.

818
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,447
- Yes.

819
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:00,080
- That's my favorite scene.

820
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,002
- And into the...

821
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:02,080
That was, I think...

822
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,468
I've never laughed

823
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,080
that hard in my life.

824
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,324
- Oh, my gosh,

825
00:24:06,364 --> 00:24:08,080
he's still up there!

826
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,709
- Oh, my God!

827
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:11,080
Oh, my God!

828
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,203
- I don't know what

829
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:13,080
you were doing.

830
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,586
- What got into you?

831
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:14,080
- Like, what... what...

832
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,057
- No, no, no, so...

833
00:24:15,097 --> 00:24:16,080
- But, like, what...

834
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,084
How do you know

835
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:18,080
how to do that?

836
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,820
- There's a lot of things

837
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,080
that I do

838
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,680
that I don't know

839
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,080
how I do, but...

840
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,513
How could you do it?

841
00:24:23,553 --> 00:24:24,080
Oh, God!

842
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,080
No, no, no!

843
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,164
The scene was set up

844
00:24:28,204 --> 00:24:29,080
perfectly for it,

845
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,771
and I was like, "Let's just

846
00:24:30,811 --> 00:24:32,080
break the fourth wall

847
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,080
and go absolutely crazy."

848
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,080
How could you do it?

849
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,858
Never before

850
00:24:37,898 --> 00:24:39,080
had those moments...

851
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,419
- Be allowed to be...

852
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:42,080
- Be allowed to be on TV.

853
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,080
d

854
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,080
- That was a serious no-no.

855
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,870
You don't break the fourth wall

856
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,170
in sitcom television.

857
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,110
- How could he do that?

858
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,080
Oh, my God!

859
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,468
- I'm telling you, that

860
00:24:54,508 --> 00:24:56,080
breaking of the fourth wall

861
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,730
with the audience,

862
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:57,080
that's a...

863
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,520
That's a really special part

864
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,080
of that connection

865
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,517
that we had with the audience.

866
00:25:03,557 --> 00:25:04,080
- Yeah.

867
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,086
- Look at me

868
00:25:05,126 --> 00:25:07,080
when I'm talking to you.

869
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,080
d

870
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,100
- Run!

871
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,056
- There's something

872
00:25:22,096 --> 00:25:23,096
different about you.

873
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,080
- We so rich.

874
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,885
Why we can't

875
00:25:31,925 --> 00:25:33,080
afford no ceiling?

876
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:36,614
- That was cute.

877
00:25:36,654 --> 00:25:37,654
- Like, that...

878
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,054
That relationship

879
00:25:39,094 --> 00:25:40,094
with the audience,

880
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,723
it was like they were in

881
00:25:41,763 --> 00:25:43,080
on the joke with us.

882
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,498
- And I always felt like

883
00:25:44,538 --> 00:25:46,080
the audience appreciated...

884
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,203
- Being brought in.

885
00:25:47,243 --> 00:25:48,080
- Being let in.

886
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,552
- Yeah.

887
00:25:48,592 --> 00:25:49,080
- Right?

888
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,045
Like, you're watching this,

889
00:25:50,085 --> 00:25:51,825
and it's written, wink, wink.

890
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,597
- And while we're

891
00:25:52,637 --> 00:25:53,637
on the subject...

892
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,445
- That's kinda fly, right?

893
00:25:58,485 --> 00:26:00,080
Don't you wish you lived on TV?

894
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,478
- When we were doing the show,

895
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,080
I have to say

896
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,774
I always felt like

897
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:05,080
it was just us

898
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,568
and the audience

899
00:26:05,608 --> 00:26:06,080
that was present.

900
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,740
I had no sense of millions

901
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,080
of viewers beyond that.

902
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,290
- Oh.

903
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,080
- Let alone decades

904
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,673
and generations after that.

905
00:26:13,713 --> 00:26:14,713
- Yeah.

906
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,674
- I just want to sit here

907
00:26:16,714 --> 00:26:18,080
and watch a little TV.

908
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,080
- It was three shows.

909
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,281
It was

910
00:26:20,321 --> 00:26:21,080
"Monday Night Football."

911
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,080
It was "Monday Night Movie."

912
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,357
And "The Fresh Prince

913
00:26:24,397 --> 00:26:25,080
of Bel-Air."

914
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,449
- People would leave

915
00:26:26,489 --> 00:26:28,100
"Monday Night Football,"

916
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,423
go over to

917
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:30,603
that other channel,

918
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:31,773
and watch

919
00:26:31,813 --> 00:26:34,080
"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air."

920
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,233
- It's like a beautiful

921
00:26:35,273 --> 00:26:36,080
underdog position

922
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,903
where you're not

923
00:26:36,943 --> 00:26:38,323
really expected to win.

924
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,013
You're not gonna beat

925
00:26:40,053 --> 00:26:41,080
"Monday Night Football,"

926
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,007
but we enjoyed the rumble.

927
00:26:43,047 --> 00:26:44,047
d

928
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,080
Now it's on!

929
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,522
- People loved watching

930
00:26:47,562 --> 00:26:48,080
the show,

931
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,080
which meant a lot

932
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,343
because they didn't have it

933
00:26:50,383 --> 00:26:51,080
on their phones.

934
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,585
You had to actually

935
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:54,080
watch it to see it,

936
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,080
and then the next day

937
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,918
you would have to read

938
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:59,080
about it in the newspaper.

939
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,465
- I realized that

940
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:04,080
this show was bigger

941
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,885
than I could

942
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:06,080
have ever expected

943
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,853
when there were

944
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:08,080
80-year-old grandmothers

945
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,490
that would come up to me

946
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,080
and say, "Jazz."

947
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,925
That freaked me out

948
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,080
because I didn't correlate

949
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,559
that people were recognizing

950
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:17,080
you from the television show.

951
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,411
- One thing special to me

952
00:27:21,451 --> 00:27:23,080
about the show was

953
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,331
we had a really unique

954
00:27:25,371 --> 00:27:28,100
and distinct fashion sense.

955
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,958
- I didn't realize

956
00:27:30,998 --> 00:27:32,080
how much freedom we had

957
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,149
when it came down

958
00:27:33,189 --> 00:27:34,080
to the clothes.

959
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,192
- We always wanted to have

960
00:27:35,232 --> 00:27:36,080
the hottest stuff on.

961
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,981
You know, we were

962
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:38,080
always trying to find

963
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:38,615
what was

964
00:27:38,655 --> 00:27:40,080
the hottest new thing.

965
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,888
- It isn't as easy

966
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:43,080
at it looks.

967
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,731
- This was a very

968
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:48,080
impactful time

969
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,080
in pop culture,

970
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,952
where, you know,

971
00:27:49,992 --> 00:27:51,252
you wanted to be fly.

972
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,404
- Eh, it's a little something

973
00:27:53,444 --> 00:27:54,080
I put together.

974
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,273
Jordan would send over

975
00:27:55,313 --> 00:27:56,080
the new Jordans

976
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,222
six weeks before they

977
00:27:57,262 --> 00:27:58,080
were coming out.

978
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,646
- You don't realize, you're

979
00:27:59,686 --> 00:28:01,080
wearing a pair of Jordans

980
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,784
that this picture

981
00:28:02,824 --> 00:28:04,080
is circulated

982
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,436
among sneakerheads

983
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,080
for the past 30 years.

984
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,080
- Ah.

985
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,080
That's what's wrong.

986
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,100
- What?

987
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,080
- Ha ha.

988
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,987
- You know, I think that

989
00:28:17,027 --> 00:28:18,096
"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"

990
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,415
is a bigger hit now

991
00:28:19,455 --> 00:28:21,080
than it was ever before.

992
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,375
- Yes, it's the cast,

993
00:28:22,415 --> 00:28:24,080
and the cast is fun to watch

994
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,871
and all of that, but I think

995
00:28:25,911 --> 00:28:27,080
it's the idea of it

996
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,254
as the part that, I think,

997
00:28:29,294 --> 00:28:30,080
translates

998
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,080
to so many different places.

999
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,347
- For years, I've had

1000
00:28:34,387 --> 00:28:36,080
people come up to me and say,

1001
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,534
"This show was

1002
00:28:36,574 --> 00:28:37,080
my favorite show,

1003
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,252
and now it's my son's

1004
00:28:38,292 --> 00:28:39,080
favorite show."

1005
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,185
And I think "The Fresh

1006
00:28:40,225 --> 00:28:41,080
Prince of Bel-Air"

1007
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,080
had a lot of impact.

1008
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,173
- The things

1009
00:28:45,213 --> 00:28:47,080
that stuck out for me

1010
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,357
whenever I've thought

1011
00:28:48,397 --> 00:28:49,080
of this show

1012
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,588
has always been our Tuesdays

1013
00:28:51,628 --> 00:28:54,080
and Wednesdays run-throughs.

1014
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,349
- The way the week would work,

1015
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:58,080
we'd come in on Monday.

1016
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,057
Everybody's there,

1017
00:28:59,097 --> 00:29:00,080
writers, producers,

1018
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,787
director, everybody,

1019
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:04,080
and we read the screenplay.

1020
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,080
- Why don't you, Mom?

1021
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,968
It's all hollow and

1022
00:29:07,008 --> 00:29:08,448
meaningless anyway, so...

1023
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,665
Did I say it right?

1024
00:29:10,705 --> 00:29:11,080
I'm...

1025
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,080
- We'd come in on Tuesday,

1026
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,256
and we'd kinda block it,

1027
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:15,080
and we'd work it,

1028
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,396
but it was our time

1029
00:29:16,436 --> 00:29:17,436
to present

1030
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,378
our ideas

1031
00:29:18,418 --> 00:29:19,080
and our thoughts and,

1032
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,380
"Hey, what if it was like this?

1033
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,080
What about that?"

1034
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,295
- And I just kinda stop

1035
00:29:22,335 --> 00:29:23,080
and just watch?

1036
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,343
- Yeah, 'cause you supposed

1037
00:29:24,383 --> 00:29:25,080
to hear the kids

1038
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,337
and turn back around.

1039
00:29:27,377 --> 00:29:28,080
- Okay.

1040
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,080
- That Tuesday and Wednesday

1041
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,186
would be a beautifully

1042
00:29:31,226 --> 00:29:33,080
collaborative period

1043
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,915
where the actors

1044
00:29:34,955 --> 00:29:37,080
would find the soul

1045
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,948
and the truth of the moments

1046
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:42,080
for these characters.

1047
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,402
- The idea that we,

1048
00:29:44,442 --> 00:29:47,080
as a Black show on TV,

1049
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,697
one of three at the time,

1050
00:29:48,737 --> 00:29:49,080
right?

1051
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,693
There weren't really us

1052
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:52,080
in the writers room,

1053
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,926
and as an actor,

1054
00:29:52,966 --> 00:29:54,080
you never had a voice.

1055
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,357
You never had a voice

1056
00:29:55,397 --> 00:29:56,080
in the room.

1057
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,740
You were a puppet

1058
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,080
who was told what to do.

1059
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,615
- Take your notes.

1060
00:30:00,655 --> 00:30:01,080
- Say this line.

1061
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,667
- Yeah.

1062
00:30:01,707 --> 00:30:03,080
- Move over here.

1063
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,067
- At some point the producers

1064
00:30:05,107 --> 00:30:06,080
and the writers

1065
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,586
wanted to make Hilary

1066
00:30:07,626 --> 00:30:09,080
a strong Black woman.

1067
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,520
They wanted to, like,

1068
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,080
see that switch in her,

1069
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,486
and then I felt like,

1070
00:30:13,526 --> 00:30:14,080
you know,

1071
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,661
there are some people

1072
00:30:15,701 --> 00:30:17,080
who are just flawed

1073
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,080
and see things a certain way,

1074
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,952
and you can learn a lot

1075
00:30:20,992 --> 00:30:22,080
from them too.

1076
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,080
Look, I'm a career woman.

1077
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,680
I don't have time to dust

1078
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,080
and push around that...

1079
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,086
Oh, what do you call

1080
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:29,080
that big, loud thing

1081
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,080
that sucks up everything?

1082
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,113
- We were able to share

1083
00:30:34,153 --> 00:30:36,080
the experience,

1084
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,402
the real experience

1085
00:30:38,442 --> 00:30:41,080
and gave those writers

1086
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,780
our perspective.

1087
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,080
- Yeah.

1088
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,830
- You can put your hands

1089
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,080
down, Jazz.

1090
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,775
- No way.

1091
00:30:46,815 --> 00:30:48,080
Dude's got a gun.

1092
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,970
Next thing you know, I got

1093
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:52,100
six warning shots in my back.

1094
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,147
When we did

1095
00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:56,080
the courtroom scene,

1096
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,680
there was a level

1097
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,080
of truth to it.

1098
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,572
That's the reason

1099
00:30:59,612 --> 00:31:00,080
why they wrote it.

1100
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,361
I'm putting

1101
00:31:02,401 --> 00:31:06,080
my hands down now.

1102
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,925
- Part of the power

1103
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:08,080
of what we would always do

1104
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,080
with "The Fresh Prince,"

1105
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,781
there would be

1106
00:31:11,821 --> 00:31:14,080
very powerful ideas

1107
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,333
under the jokes

1108
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,080
and under the comedy.

1109
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,615
- You can wear the T-shirts,

1110
00:31:18,655 --> 00:31:20,080
you can put up the posters,

1111
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,080
and you can shout the slogans,

1112
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,354
but unless you know

1113
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:24,080
all the history behind it,

1114
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,551
you're trivializing

1115
00:31:25,591 --> 00:31:27,080
the entire struggle.

1116
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,499
- That is one of those things

1117
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:29,539
that I think

1118
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,080
kinda makes people understand

1119
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,326
just how groundbreaking

1120
00:31:33,366 --> 00:31:34,080
this show was.

1121
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,080
- It is as relevant today

1122
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,570
as it was 30 years ago,

1123
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,080
unfortunately.

1124
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,980
- Whenever we would come

1125
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,080
across moments

1126
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,724
that they wrote that was like,

1127
00:31:45,764 --> 00:31:47,080
"This wouldn't happen..."

1128
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,905
- Right.

1129
00:31:47,945 --> 00:31:51,080
- "Black people don't do this."

1130
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,229
- Right.

1131
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:53,080
- Yes.

1132
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,533
- Tuesday and Wednesday is

1133
00:31:54,573 --> 00:31:56,080
what made this show special,

1134
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,545
because we made sure that we

1135
00:31:58,585 --> 00:32:01,100
were authentic every episode.

1136
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,915
- I had spent a career

1137
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,080
being on shows

1138
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,652
that showed the variety

1139
00:32:06,692 --> 00:32:08,080
of the Black culture,

1140
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,116
showing that we were not just

1141
00:32:10,156 --> 00:32:12,080
a monolithic group of people

1142
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,341
with one idea

1143
00:32:13,381 --> 00:32:15,080
and one lifestyle,

1144
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,080
and when I got here,

1145
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,344
we had the freedom

1146
00:32:17,384 --> 00:32:19,080
to express to the writers

1147
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,045
the cultural aspects of what

1148
00:32:21,085 --> 00:32:23,080
they had in the written word.

1149
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,115
I remember a table read

1150
00:32:25,155 --> 00:32:26,080
one Monday,

1151
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,015
and there was some line that

1152
00:32:28,055 --> 00:32:30,080
they had given Tatyana to say,

1153
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,080
and I said, "Excuse me,

1154
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,080
if Tatyana says that

1155
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,824
to her daddy,

1156
00:32:34,864 --> 00:32:36,080
she'd lose her teeth."

1157
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,950
- Yeah, yeah,

1158
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,080
exactly, exactly.

1159
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,164
- So no, culturally,

1160
00:32:39,204 --> 00:32:40,080
we don't do that.

1161
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:40,986
- James used to sit

1162
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:42,406
where you're sitting...

1163
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:43,279
- Yep.

1164
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:44,080
- That was James's spot.

1165
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,080
- During those note sessions,

1166
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,826
and that is where I learned

1167
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:49,080
that

1168
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,080
what we do is not for us.

1169
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,080
It's not about us.

1170
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,184
We are here

1171
00:32:58,224 --> 00:33:00,080
to bring dignity...

1172
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,080
- Mm-hmm.

1173
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,800
- To represent, to expand,

1174
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,080
to push forward,

1175
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,713
and I learned that here

1176
00:33:10,753 --> 00:33:12,080
at his feet.

1177
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,080
- This one takes the cake.

1178
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,960
- James is the heart

1179
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,080
of the show.

1180
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,080
- I love you, Uncle Phil.

1181
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,357
- We knew that

1182
00:33:24,397 --> 00:33:26,080
he knew the answers

1183
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,800
or could guide folks

1184
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,080
to the answers.

1185
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,080
- Carlton, sit.

1186
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,080
- As you wish, Father.

1187
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,087
- James had a very deep love

1188
00:33:35,127 --> 00:33:36,080
of jazz music,

1189
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,391
and I would spend a lot

1190
00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:39,080
of times in his dressing room,

1191
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,080
and he would give me jazz CDs.

1192
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,586
- You know, he got his

1193
00:33:42,626 --> 00:33:44,080
Billie Holiday picture

1194
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,080
up on the wall,

1195
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,233
a little Charlie "Bird"

1196
00:33:47,273 --> 00:33:48,080
Parker, you know?

1197
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,490
Boy, I'm telling you,

1198
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,080
this man got mad flavor.

1199
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:51,844
- The music that

1200
00:33:51,884 --> 00:33:53,080
was coming out of his room

1201
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,560
was always just amazing.

1202
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,580
- Ashley, honey,

1203
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,080
this is possibly

1204
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,383
the most beautiful music

1205
00:33:57,423 --> 00:33:58,080
ever written.

1206
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,080
- He was my teacher.

1207
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,526
I learned what it means

1208
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:04,080
to be an artist from him.

1209
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,398
- Learning that there's

1210
00:34:05,438 --> 00:34:06,438
other works,

1211
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,749
there's other arts

1212
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:08,080
out there

1213
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,960
that would help you understand

1214
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,080
yours even better.

1215
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,869
- I was watching

1216
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:13,080
this Robeson documentary,

1217
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,086
and James used to bring up

1218
00:34:15,126 --> 00:34:16,080
Paul Robeson.

1219
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,526
He, like, introduced me

1220
00:34:17,566 --> 00:34:19,080
to Black art in ways that

1221
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,379
I wouldn't have gotten

1222
00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:22,080
that education anywhere else,

1223
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,539
and I'm watching

1224
00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:25,080
this documentary,

1225
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,732
and they're talking about him

1226
00:34:26,772 --> 00:34:28,080
singing "Ol' Man River."

1227
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,380
Him changing the word

1228
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,353
from "nigger" to "darkie."

1229
00:34:33,393 --> 00:34:34,080
- Darkie, yeah.

1230
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,448
- How hard he had to fight

1231
00:34:36,488 --> 00:34:38,100
for that one word.

1232
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:39,502
- Yeah.

1233
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:41,080
- It wasn't that long ago.

1234
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,120
- And it wasn't

1235
00:34:42,157 --> 00:34:43,080
that long ago.

1236
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,987
So you think about that,

1237
00:34:44,027 --> 00:34:45,096
you think about all the shows

1238
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,991
that came before... and I'm

1239
00:34:46,031 --> 00:34:47,096
just talking about television.

1240
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,512
- Every little step.

1241
00:34:48,552 --> 00:34:50,080
- And now what we see,

1242
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,586
it's such a privilege

1243
00:34:52,626 --> 00:34:55,080
to be a part of that.

1244
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,007
- Yes.

1245
00:34:56,047 --> 00:34:57,080
- Yeah.

1246
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,087
- You know, that history,

1247
00:34:58,127 --> 00:34:59,080
and those notes sessions,

1248
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,446
that's where I went to school,

1249
00:35:00,486 --> 00:35:01,080
like, that's...

1250
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,903
- And that was...

1251
00:35:01,943 --> 00:35:03,080
No, that was the thing.

1252
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:08,080
James, he pushed me so hard.

1253
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,080
- You think you're so wise.

1254
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,967
Look at me

1255
00:35:11,007 --> 00:35:13,100
when I'm talking to you.

1256
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,080
Let me tell you something, son.

1257
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,348
I grew up on the streets

1258
00:35:18,388 --> 00:35:19,388
just like you.

1259
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,548
I encountered bigotry

1260
00:35:21,588 --> 00:35:23,080
you could not imagine.

1261
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,120
Now, you have a nice poster

1262
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,080
of Malcolm X on your wall.

1263
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,080
I heard the brother speak.

1264
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,080
I read every word he wrote.

1265
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,004
Believe me,

1266
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:36,100
I know where I come from.

1267
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,036
- His thing was that I am

1268
00:35:39,076 --> 00:35:41,080
in such a unique position,

1269
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,854
and that responsibility,

1270
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:47,080
you must elevate your craft.

1271
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,492
You have to represent,

1272
00:35:48,532 --> 00:35:50,080
and you are paving a way,

1273
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,197
and he just wouldn't

1274
00:35:51,237 --> 00:35:52,080
give me an inch,

1275
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,329
and I remember in the...

1276
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:56,080
One of my favorite

1277
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,234
and most famous scenes

1278
00:35:58,274 --> 00:36:00,080
from "Fresh Prince"

1279
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,440
is the father episode.

1280
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,444
Hey, what's up, man?

1281
00:36:03,484 --> 00:36:05,080
Can I get you something?

1282
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,100
- No, I'm fine, son.

1283
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,100
- Um, if you need...

1284
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,100
- So is he a cop?

1285
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,080
- He's my father.

1286
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,080
So, you know, James Avery

1287
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,080
was this 6'4",

1288
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,080
300-pound...

1289
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,586
- Plus.

1290
00:36:30,626 --> 00:36:32,080
- Yeah.

1291
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,246
- Stage-trained...

1292
00:36:34,286 --> 00:36:35,080
- Yeah.

1293
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,080
- Shakespearean beast, right?

1294
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,118
And I'm... I'm the little rapper

1295
00:36:40,158 --> 00:36:42,080
from Philly under him, right?

1296
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,828
And I wanted him to think

1297
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,080
I was good so bad.

1298
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,541
- You wanted him

1299
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:46,080
to be proud of you.

1300
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,961
- I wanted him

1301
00:36:47,001 --> 00:36:48,080
to be proud of me,

1302
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,380
so the episode comes,

1303
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,246
and, you know,

1304
00:36:51,286 --> 00:36:53,080
we come to that scene,

1305
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,920
and I was like, I'm... you know,

1306
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,990
I wanna deliver

1307
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,080
this scene so bad,

1308
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,419
and if you remember,

1309
00:36:58,459 --> 00:37:00,080
in front of the audience,

1310
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,018
I flubbed my line

1311
00:37:03,058 --> 00:37:05,080
on the take.

1312
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,080
- Mm-hmm.

1313
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,974
- And I messed it up

1314
00:37:07,014 --> 00:37:08,514
in front of the audience,

1315
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,029
and my mind snapped,

1316
00:37:11,069 --> 00:37:13,080
and I'm like, "Aghh!"

1317
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,583
I'm like,

1318
00:37:14,623 --> 00:37:17,080
"Ahh! Damn it!"

1319
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,584
And James says,

1320
00:37:18,624 --> 00:37:19,080
"Hey!

1321
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,080
Right here!"

1322
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,937
and I was like... and

1323
00:37:22,977 --> 00:37:25,100
he was like, "Use me!"

1324
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:27,907
And I'm like...

1325
00:37:27,947 --> 00:37:29,080
And I'm right there,

1326
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,181
and he takes, and he's like,

1327
00:37:30,205 --> 00:37:31,645
"Get yourself together,"

1328
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,243
And I get it together,

1329
00:37:33,283 --> 00:37:34,080
and I'm looking,

1330
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,080
and he says, "Action."

1331
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,080
- I'm sorry, I...

1332
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:36,983
You know, if there was

1333
00:37:37,023 --> 00:37:38,096
something that I could do...

1334
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,104
- Hey, you know what? You ain't

1335
00:37:39,144 --> 00:37:40,080
got to do nothing, Uncle Phil.

1336
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,724
You know, ain't like I'm still

1337
00:37:41,764 --> 00:37:43,080
five years old, you know?

1338
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,152
Ain't like I'ma be sitting up

1339
00:37:44,176 --> 00:37:45,080
every night asking my mom,

1340
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,704
"When is Daddy coming home?"

1341
00:37:46,744 --> 00:37:48,080
You know? Who needs him?

1342
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,080
And the scene that we do

1343
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,854
is the scene that ended up

1344
00:37:52,894 --> 00:37:55,080
being in the episode.

1345
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,022
I ain't need him then,

1346
00:37:56,062 --> 00:37:57,080
and I don't need him now.

1347
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,080
- Will, Will...

1348
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,397
- Nah, you know what,

1349
00:37:59,437 --> 00:38:00,080
Uncle Phil?

1350
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,419
I'ma get through college

1351
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:02,080
without him.

1352
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,700
I'm get a great job

1353
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,080
without him.

1354
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,925
I'ma marry me

1355
00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:05,080
a beautiful honey,

1356
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,926
and I'ma have me

1357
00:38:05,966 --> 00:38:07,080
a whole bunch of kids.

1358
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,660
I'ma be a better father

1359
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,080
than he ever was!

1360
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:08,958
And I sure as hell

1361
00:38:08,998 --> 00:38:10,080
don't need him for that

1362
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,146
'cause ain't a damn thing

1363
00:38:11,186 --> 00:38:12,080
he could ever teach me

1364
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,100
about how to love my kids!

1365
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,100
d

1366
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,780
How come he don't

1367
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,100
want me, man?

1368
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,580
And I fall into his arms

1369
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,080
at the end of the scene,

1370
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,080
and he's holding me,

1371
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,961
and, you know,

1372
00:38:33,001 --> 00:38:34,080
the shot pans off,

1373
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,702
and he whispered

1374
00:38:34,742 --> 00:38:35,080
in my ear,

1375
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,969
he said,

1376
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:39,080
"Now, that's acting," right?

1377
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,080
- That's right.

1378
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,436
- "That's acting,"

1379
00:38:41,476 --> 00:38:43,080
and I was like, "Ahh!"

1380
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,051
You know, every single time.

1381
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:47,891
- I cry every time I see that.

1382
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,459
- Every single time,

1383
00:38:49,499 --> 00:38:50,080
you know?

1384
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,490
And it's like, he just...

1385
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,100
He, um... he, uh...

1386
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,326
It's like... oh, come on.

1387
00:38:57,366 --> 00:38:58,080
Don't do this.

1388
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,346
- I know, I'm s...

1389
00:38:59,386 --> 00:39:00,080
I'm sorry.

1390
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,080
- Tatyana throwing me off.

1391
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,100
And it's like, when...

1392
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,080
It's like, people do...

1393
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,000
People don't even know

1394
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,080
when they're shaping you

1395
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,020
and forming you

1396
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,080
and crafting you.

1397
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,729
- He knew.

1398
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:17,080
- In that w... he knew.

1399
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,287
No, that's what I'm saying.

1400
00:39:18,327 --> 00:39:19,080
- I think he knew.

1401
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,080
- He knew what he was doing.

1402
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,638
- There's some people

1403
00:39:21,678 --> 00:39:22,080
that plant seeds.

1404
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,509
- Yep.

1405
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:24,080
- That's what they do.

1406
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,840
And they do it to anyone

1407
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,080
they come across.

1408
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,685
- I mean, he was...

1409
00:39:28,725 --> 00:39:31,080
He was proud of who he was.

1410
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,080
He was proud of his race.

1411
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,470
He was proud of the history

1412
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,080
of his race.

1413
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,080
- Yes.

1414
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,844
- And, you know,

1415
00:39:36,884 --> 00:39:38,080
he could see it, you know?

1416
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,788
And it fell upon you,

1417
00:39:38,828 --> 00:39:39,080
you know?

1418
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,027
It fell upon you

1419
00:39:41,067 --> 00:39:43,080
to grab the rein.

1420
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,080
- Vote for Philip Banks.

1421
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,080
Philip Banks.

1422
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,080
Break out Lucille.

1423
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,335
I've got a few questions

1424
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:56,080
for you.

1425
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,766
When you got

1426
00:39:56,806 --> 00:39:58,080
this alleged confession

1427
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:58,976
from these two young men,

1428
00:39:59,016 --> 00:40:00,096
did they have a lawyer present?

1429
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,286
No, so, officer,

1430
00:40:01,326 --> 00:40:03,080
just open that damn cell

1431
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,340
and let those two boys

1432
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,080
out of there,

1433
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,675
or I'm gonna tie this place up

1434
00:40:05,715 --> 00:40:06,975
in so much litigation

1435
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,080
that your grandchildren

1436
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,080
are gonna need lawyers!

1437
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,120
d

1438
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,100
- That's right.

1439
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,442
- Nicky, you remember in

1440
00:40:19,482 --> 00:40:21,080
"The Lion King" when Mufasa...

1441
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,080
- Daddy, did you sit on Harry?

1442
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,080
- Yes, but... but...

1443
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,080
- That's okay, Dad.

1444
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,313
Death is a natural part

1445
00:40:31,353 --> 00:40:32,353
of life.

1446
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,522
- All right, all right.

1447
00:40:42,562 --> 00:40:43,080
- Oh, no.

1448
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,576
- Now, noble Geoffrey,

1449
00:40:45,616 --> 00:40:49,100
the gods today stand beside us.

1450
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,656
- A lot of good times

1451
00:40:54,696 --> 00:40:56,080
in this house, huh?

1452
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,080
- A lifetime's worth.

1453
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,080
Trust me, Will.

1454
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,735
I know it doesn't feel

1455
00:41:01,775 --> 00:41:03,080
like it right now,

1456
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,080
but what they say is true.

1457
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,441
Winning really

1458
00:41:05,481 --> 00:41:07,080
isn't everything.

1459
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,705
I'm sorry

1460
00:41:07,745 --> 00:41:09,080
I let you down, son.

1461
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,085
- You could never

1462
00:41:10,125 --> 00:41:11,125
let me down, Dad.

1463
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,100
- I love you.

1464
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,411
Just remember,

1465
00:41:19,451 --> 00:41:22,080
happiness comes from inside.

1466
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,100
- I love you, Daddy.

1467
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,688
- Nobody does anything

1468
00:41:27,728 --> 00:41:29,080
without help, Will.

1469
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,080
People opened doors for me,

1470
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,033
and I've worked hard

1471
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,080
to open doors for you.

1472
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,537
It doesn't make you any less

1473
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:36,080
of a man to walk through them.

1474
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,080
I have something special.

1475
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,080
- You always said

1476
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,436
that spending time

1477
00:41:43,476 --> 00:41:45,080
with me and the family

1478
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,686
was the most important thing

1479
00:41:46,726 --> 00:41:47,080
to you.

1480
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,415
- I'm lucky to have

1481
00:41:48,455 --> 00:41:50,080
such a wonderful family.

1482
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,142
- Look, Uncle Phil, I just

1483
00:42:08,182 --> 00:42:09,080
don't want you to think

1484
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,144
that I'm that same

1485
00:42:10,184 --> 00:42:11,184
stupid kid I was

1486
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:12,970
when I first

1487
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,080
moved out here.

1488
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,509
I love you, Uncle Phil, and

1489
00:42:15,549 --> 00:42:17,080
I just don't want to lose you,

1490
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,380
you know, any of you.

1491
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,080
- You're not gonna lose us.

1492
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,080
You are my son, Will.

1493
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,120
End of story.

1494
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,100
- Amen.

1495
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,080
Well, guys,

1496
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,080
give him a hand.

1497
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:58,363
- Yeah.

1498
00:42:58,403 --> 00:42:59,483
- Give him a hand.

1499
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:00,480
- Yes.

1500
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,080
- Oh, James, I miss you.

1501
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,100
- James, man.

1502
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,100
- Whew.

1503
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,819
I think what happens

1504
00:43:17,859 --> 00:43:20,080
on family shows like this,

1505
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,080
it's one of those things,

1506
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,709
you cannot buy

1507
00:43:24,749 --> 00:43:28,100
or fake chemistry.

1508
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,654
It's just the way that

1509
00:43:30,694 --> 00:43:32,080
we all came together

1510
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,080
as a group was very special.

1511
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,080
So as a family, you know,

1512
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,585
we have our things

1513
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:40,080
that we talk about

1514
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,646
and then we have our things

1515
00:43:41,686 --> 00:43:43,080
that we don't talk about.

1516
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,441
- Where are you going

1517
00:43:44,481 --> 00:43:45,080
with this?

1518
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,237
- Yeah, I know.

1519
00:43:46,277 --> 00:43:47,080
- You know?

1520
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:52,080
We never really together,

1521
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,642
like, publicly

1522
00:43:53,682 --> 00:43:55,080
talk about...

1523
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,080
um, Janet.

1524
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,080
- Hmm.

1525
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,100
- And what happened,

1526
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,080
and for me,

1527
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,080
it felt like

1528
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,080
I couldn't celebrate

1529
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,080
30 years of "Fresh Prince"

1530
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:20,080
without finding a way

1531
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:24,080
to celebrate Janet.

1532
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,080
So she agreed to sit down

1533
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:28,829
and have a conversation

1534
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:29,869
with me,

1535
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,346
and Janet and I saw

1536
00:44:31,386 --> 00:44:32,080
one another

1537
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,080
for the first time in 27 years

1538
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,335
yesterday.

1539
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:37,080
- Wow.

1540
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,085
- And I wanna show

1541
00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:39,080
you guys some of...

1542
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,766
- Oh, my gosh.

1543
00:44:40,806 --> 00:44:42,100
- Ooh, wow.

1544
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,542
- Take a seat here.

1545
00:44:44,582 --> 00:44:45,080
- Okay.

1546
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,080
- Thank you very much.

1547
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:47,784
If you need anything at all,

1548
00:44:47,824 --> 00:44:48,080
let me know.

1549
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,205
- Okay.

1550
00:44:49,245 --> 00:44:52,100
- Okay, thank you.

1551
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,003
- Tell me if my eyes glow

1552
00:44:58,043 --> 00:44:59,080
like a raccoon

1553
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,080
'cause they sometimes do.

1554
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,433
- Your eyes look spectacular.

1555
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,203
It's so good to see you.

1556
00:45:14,243 --> 00:45:15,383
- You too, you too.

1557
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:16,745
Oh, my God.

1558
00:45:16,785 --> 00:45:18,105
Where are you sitting?

1559
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,080
Been a long time.

1560
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,085
- It's been

1561
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:24,080
a real long time, 20...

1562
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,100
- 30.

1563
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,080
- My name is Janet Hubert,

1564
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,222
and I played the role

1565
00:45:29,262 --> 00:45:30,080
of Vivian Banks.

1566
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,080
I guess they call me the O.G.,

1567
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,080
the original Aunt Vivian.

1568
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,164
- The night is young, baby,

1569
00:45:36,204 --> 00:45:37,080
and so am I.

1570
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,080
My life is great.

1571
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,405
This party is gonna be great,

1572
00:45:40,445 --> 00:45:42,080
and I look fantastic.

1573
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,752
- Janet brought such

1574
00:45:44,792 --> 00:45:48,080
authenticity and dignity.

1575
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,402
- My name is not Mom.

1576
00:45:49,442 --> 00:45:51,080
My name is Professor Banks.

1577
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:51,639
That is how I prefer

1578
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:52,679
to be addressed.

1579
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:53,969
Is that clear, class?

1580
00:45:54,009 --> 00:45:55,080
Yes, Professor Banks.

1581
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,149
- I didn't expect

1582
00:45:56,189 --> 00:45:57,080
to get the role

1583
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,080
because I had not seen anyone

1584
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,233
who looked like me

1585
00:46:01,273 --> 00:46:03,080
playing those kinds of roles.

1586
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:03,636
- We just want to make sure

1587
00:46:03,676 --> 00:46:04,996
that the person we get

1588
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,080
is properly qualified.

1589
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:06,934
- For example,

1590
00:46:06,974 --> 00:46:08,080
a college professor

1591
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:08,985
with a PhD who's taught

1592
00:46:09,025 --> 00:46:10,705
Black history and literature

1593
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,080
at the university level?

1594
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,249
- Where are we gonna find

1595
00:46:13,289 --> 00:46:14,080
someone like that?

1596
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,080
- You're looking at her.

1597
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:20,136
- Janet was this beautiful,

1598
00:46:20,176 --> 00:46:22,080
dark-skinned,

1599
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,525
talented... she could sing.

1600
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:26,080
She could dance.

1601
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,357
- One, two, three.

1602
00:46:30,397 --> 00:46:31,080
Ooh.

1603
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:31,661
- I enjoyed it.

1604
00:46:31,701 --> 00:46:32,701
I loved it.

1605
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,080
I loved the way they wrote.

1606
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:34,811
I loved that

1607
00:46:34,851 --> 00:46:36,080
she was professional.

1608
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,711
I loved that she was

1609
00:46:37,751 --> 00:46:40,080
intelligent, she was refined,

1610
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:40,844
but I also loved

1611
00:46:40,884 --> 00:46:42,080
that she could throw down.

1612
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:42,845
This has got to be

1613
00:46:42,885 --> 00:46:44,080
the biggest amateur operation

1614
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,085
I have seen since

1615
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:46,080
"Mayberry R.F.D."

1616
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,141
It was a rare thing

1617
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:50,080
to be able to say,

1618
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,080
wearing a $5,000 sweater,

1619
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,886
"What? What?

1620
00:46:54,926 --> 00:46:56,080
Philip?"

1621
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:56,892
Oh, honey, we 'bout

1622
00:46:56,932 --> 00:46:58,080
to get very busy up in here.

1623
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,084
"Hold me back.

1624
00:46:59,124 --> 00:47:00,124
Hold me back."

1625
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,622
- There was a certain

1626
00:47:03,662 --> 00:47:05,080
foundational element

1627
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,022
that was broken

1628
00:47:07,062 --> 00:47:09,080
when Janet left.

1629
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,100
- Well...

1630
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,043
This has been tough.

1631
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:16,083
- Yeah.

1632
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,307
- Has it been tough for you?

1633
00:47:17,347 --> 00:47:18,080
- Oh, yes, it has.

1634
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,080
- Yeah.

1635
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:20,925
I just wanted

1636
00:47:20,965 --> 00:47:22,080
to know one thing.

1637
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:22,686
- Mm-hmm?

1638
00:47:22,726 --> 00:47:23,080
- Why?

1639
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,460
Why so far?

1640
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,080
You guys went so far.

1641
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,080
I lost so much.

1642
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,248
- I think what would be...

1643
00:47:30,288 --> 00:47:32,080
- How do we heal that?

1644
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,849
- Helpful for me is,

1645
00:47:33,889 --> 00:47:35,080
like, I know...

1646
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,271
- You look good,

1647
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:37,080
by the way.

1648
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,980
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1649
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,080
You look beautiful, as always.

1650
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,080
- Older, wiser.

1651
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,086
- So I think it would be

1652
00:47:46,126 --> 00:47:48,080
helpful for me...

1653
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,080
Like, I don't know your story.

1654
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,210
- Mm-hmm, I know.

1655
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:54,080
I know.

1656
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,185
- You know?

1657
00:47:55,225 --> 00:47:56,080
- I know.

1658
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,002
- I don't know...

1659
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:58,182
- You have no idea.

1660
00:47:59,100 --> 00:47:59,393
- You know,

1661
00:47:59,433 --> 00:48:00,080
I don't know your story.

1662
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,080
- It was insane.

1663
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,680
Something I would

1664
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,080
like to clarify

1665
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:19,080
is during that third season

1666
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,080
when I got pregnant,

1667
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,357
there was a lot of things

1668
00:48:23,397 --> 00:48:25,080
going on in my life

1669
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,080
and in Will's life as well.

1670
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,586
There was some friction

1671
00:48:29,626 --> 00:48:31,080
because I was pregnant.

1672
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,080
Home life was not good at all.

1673
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,961
I was no longer laughing,

1674
00:48:36,001 --> 00:48:37,080
smiling, joking

1675
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,828
because there were things

1676
00:48:38,868 --> 00:48:40,080
that were going on

1677
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,080
that nobody knew about.

1678
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,661
The cast had no idea

1679
00:48:43,701 --> 00:48:45,080
what was going on.

1680
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,953
- You know, during that time

1681
00:48:46,993 --> 00:48:48,080
of her pregnancy,

1682
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,522
I wasn't sensitive.

1683
00:48:50,562 --> 00:48:53,080
I wasn't perceptive,

1684
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,344
and, you know, now

1685
00:48:54,384 --> 00:48:56,080
that I've had three kids,

1686
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,560
I learned some things that

1687
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,080
I did not know at the time,

1688
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,297
and I would do things

1689
00:49:01,337 --> 00:49:03,080
very differently,

1690
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,268
but I can see

1691
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:06,100
where I made the set

1692
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:10,100
very difficult for Janet.

1693
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:13,461
- They offered me

1694
00:49:13,501 --> 00:49:15,080
this really bad deal

1695
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,080
in the third season.

1696
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:17,705
They said,

1697
00:49:17,745 --> 00:49:19,080
"You've got two months

1698
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,080
"and two weeks of work,

1699
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,766
and you cannot work

1700
00:49:21,806 --> 00:49:23,080
anywhere else."

1701
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,341
So that meant

1702
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:26,100
my salary was cut.

1703
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,483
I had a new baby and a husband

1704
00:49:29,523 --> 00:49:31,100
who was out of work,

1705
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,080
so I said no.

1706
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,554
I did not accept their offer.

1707
00:49:35,594 --> 00:49:37,080
I was never fired.

1708
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,308
So the misconception

1709
00:49:39,348 --> 00:49:42,080
was always put out there.

1710
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,487
I was trapped.

1711
00:49:43,527 --> 00:49:45,080
What could I do?

1712
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,902
So they said, "Okay, then

1713
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,080
we're gonna recast your role,"

1714
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,051
and I said,

1715
00:49:51,091 --> 00:49:54,080
"What can I say?"

1716
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,080
I was hurt deeply, deeply.

1717
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,080
- So talk me through

1718
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,478
because I was having

1719
00:50:00,518 --> 00:50:02,080
a different experience.

1720
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,203
- You were going forward

1721
00:50:03,243 --> 00:50:04,080
and getting bigger,

1722
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,164
but we knew you were

1723
00:50:05,204 --> 00:50:06,080
going to be huge.

1724
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,080
I mean, we all knew that.

1725
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,120
I even said that, that part

1726
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,080
of the success of the show

1727
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,080
was because of your success,

1728
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,746
but you were destined

1729
00:50:15,786 --> 00:50:17,080
for that as well,

1730
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,100
but when I left the show,

1731
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,983
I had this new baby

1732
00:50:22,023 --> 00:50:23,080
and no one.

1733
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,080
Family disowned me.

1734
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,080
Hollywood disowned me.

1735
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,213
My family said,

1736
00:50:29,253 --> 00:50:31,080
"You've ruined our name,"

1737
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,928
and I wasn't unprofessional

1738
00:50:33,968 --> 00:50:35,080
on the set.

1739
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,377
I just stopped talking

1740
00:50:36,417 --> 00:50:37,080
to everybody

1741
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:37,724
because I didn't know

1742
00:50:37,764 --> 00:50:38,080
who to trust

1743
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,080
because I had been banished,

1744
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,816
and they said it was you

1745
00:50:43,856 --> 00:50:46,080
who... who banished me

1746
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,774
because you were...

1747
00:50:47,814 --> 00:50:49,080
You were Will.

1748
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,100
You were a kid.

1749
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,080
It was hard.

1750
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,100
- Yeah.

1751
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:04,080
I was, uh, 21 years old.

1752
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:04,472
- Yeah.

1753
00:51:04,512 --> 00:51:05,512
- You know?

1754
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,100
- I know. I know.

1755
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,631
- Everything was

1756
00:51:10,671 --> 00:51:12,080
a threat to me.

1757
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,080
- Why was I a threat?

1758
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:17,080
- Not you, the world.

1759
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,080
I was so driven by fear,

1760
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,419
and jokes and comedy

1761
00:51:20,459 --> 00:51:22,080
and all of that was how...

1762
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,348
- Yeah, yeah, you were...

1763
00:51:23,388 --> 00:51:24,080
You were live.

1764
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:24,695
- Yeah.

1765
00:51:24,735 --> 00:51:26,080
- You were live.

1766
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,252
- But what you didn't

1767
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,080
realize either,

1768
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:28,720
that I was going through

1769
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,760
a lot at home.

1770
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,080
- Mm-hmm, right.

1771
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:31,705
- You didn't know.

1772
00:51:31,745 --> 00:51:32,080
- Yup, yup.

1773
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,080
- You guys didn't know,

1774
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,080
very abusive marriage.

1775
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:36,900
- You know,

1776
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,080
I have children.

1777
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,080
- Yeah.

1778
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,212
- I've been divorced

1779
00:51:41,252 --> 00:51:44,080
and have a second marriage.

1780
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,589
And I can see now

1781
00:51:46,629 --> 00:51:49,080
the level of pain

1782
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,357
and the level of struggle

1783
00:51:51,397 --> 00:51:53,080
that it was for you

1784
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:56,698
just to show up every day,

1785
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:58,080
and then...

1786
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,782
- But you took all that away

1787
00:52:00,822 --> 00:52:03,080
from me with your words.

1788
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,291
You know, words can kill.

1789
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:06,080
- Mm-hmm.

1790
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,019
- I lost everything,

1791
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:09,080
reputation,

1792
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,080
everything, everything,

1793
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,713
and I understand you were

1794
00:52:12,753 --> 00:52:14,080
able to move forward,

1795
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,420
but you know those words,

1796
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,080
calling a Black woman difficult

1797
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,173
in Hollywood

1798
00:52:18,213 --> 00:52:20,080
is the kiss of death.

1799
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:20,624
It's the kiss of death,

1800
00:52:20,664 --> 00:52:21,080
and it's hard enough

1801
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,123
being a dark-skinned

1802
00:52:23,163 --> 00:52:26,080
Black woman in this business,

1803
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,414
but I felt it was necessary

1804
00:52:28,454 --> 00:52:31,080
for us to finally move forward.

1805
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,080
- Yep.

1806
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,288
- And I'm sorry that I have

1807
00:52:35,328 --> 00:52:37,100
blasted you to pieces.

1808
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:41,080
- Nah, it's... it is so...

1809
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,960
First of all, thank you

1810
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,080
for sharing that with me.

1811
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:51,080
Like, I didn't know that.

1812
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,709
When I've looked back now,

1813
00:52:52,749 --> 00:52:53,080
it's...

1814
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,588
You know, it's obvious that you

1815
00:52:55,628 --> 00:52:58,100
were having a hard time, and...

1816
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,080
I felt like you hated me.

1817
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,100
- No.

1818
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:12,080
- You know, I...

1819
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:16,080
I could not do

1820
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:20,080
a 30-year celebration

1821
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,080
of this show

1822
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:26,080
and not celebrate you,

1823
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,164
celebrate your contribution

1824
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:29,080
to the show,

1825
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,771
celebrate your contribution

1826
00:53:30,811 --> 00:53:32,080
to my life, you know?

1827
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,080
And...

1828
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,258
- Come here, you.

1829
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:44,080
27 years, I think...

1830
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,705
I think we were just

1831
00:53:45,745 --> 00:53:47,080
short of 27 years

1832
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,941
that we didn't speak

1833
00:53:49,981 --> 00:53:52,080
to one another,

1834
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,061
and I'm just...

1835
00:53:53,101 --> 00:53:55,080
I'm glad we're talking again.

1836
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:58,080
The person I want to be

1837
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:03,080
is someone who protects you,

1838
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,244
not someone

1839
00:54:04,284 --> 00:54:07,080
that unleashes dogs on you,

1840
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:11,080
and however...

1841
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,138
- I appreciate that.

1842
00:54:12,178 --> 00:54:13,080
- You know, it's...

1843
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,080
- I appreciate that.

1844
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,100
I have to say,

1845
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:21,080
after 27 years,

1846
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:21,832
being here today

1847
00:54:21,872 --> 00:54:23,080
and having the conversation

1848
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:26,540
that Will and I had together,

1849
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:28,080
it's healing.

1850
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,127
I was watching the dance

1851
00:54:29,167 --> 00:54:30,080
episode the other day,

1852
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,585
and that's become

1853
00:54:31,625 --> 00:54:33,080
one of the crazy,

1854
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:33,618
iconic...

1855
00:54:33,658 --> 00:54:34,080
- Yeah.

1856
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,018
- They send me videos

1857
00:54:35,058 --> 00:54:36,080
from all over the world.

1858
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,080
- On the TikTok right now.

1859
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,080
- Of their mamas doing it.

1860
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,286
- I know, right?

1861
00:54:39,326 --> 00:54:41,080
- Oh, God. Their mamas...

1862
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,798
- Listen, the Aunt Viv, boy,

1863
00:54:42,838 --> 00:54:44,080
rocking the Aunt Viv.

1864
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,487
- The Aunt Viv.

1865
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,080
I don't know if it's real.

1866
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,080
I feel like this is a dream.

1867
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,085
I didn't come here

1868
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:56,080
to have animosity.

1869
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:59,080
I came here to resolve,

1870
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,080
'cause it's time.

1871
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,080
You still feel like...

1872
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,524
- Like I'm little?

1873
00:55:03,564 --> 00:55:04,564
- Yeah.

1874
00:55:05,553 --> 00:55:06,080
Yes.

1875
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,142
- You're still my Aunt Viv.

1876
00:55:07,166 --> 00:55:08,080
You're still my Aunt Viv.

1877
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,639
- Yeah, you do.

1878
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:11,080
It's so weird.

1879
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,120
You know, we've said

1880
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:13,080
such hateful things

1881
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:13,753
about each other publicly.

1882
00:55:13,793 --> 00:55:14,080
- Oh, I know.

1883
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:14,682
Ugh.

1884
00:55:14,722 --> 00:55:17,080
- And I'm sorry.

1885
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,211
- I'm sorry.

1886
00:55:18,251 --> 00:55:20,100
- And I'm sorry too.

1887
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:23,969
We good?

1888
00:55:24,009 --> 00:55:25,080
- We good.

1889
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:25,916
- We good.

1890
00:55:25,956 --> 00:55:27,080
- We are good.

1891
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,080
One of the major things for me,

1892
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,553
it was the first time

1893
00:55:36,593 --> 00:55:38,080
I was ever able to see

1894
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,148
how much pain she is in

1895
00:55:41,188 --> 00:55:44,080
and was in and just...

1896
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,082
- Jesus.

1897
00:55:45,122 --> 00:55:48,080
- What she was carrying,

1898
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:48,568
you know,

1899
00:55:48,608 --> 00:55:50,080
what she was trying to hide,

1900
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,271
what she was trying

1901
00:55:51,311 --> 00:55:52,080
to hold onto,

1902
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,537
and, you know,

1903
00:55:53,577 --> 00:55:55,080
she set a tone,

1904
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,870
and she set a...

1905
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:00,080
Set a standard on this show

1906
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,952
that's an integral part

1907
00:56:01,992 --> 00:56:03,080
of the success

1908
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,927
of "The Fresh Prince,"

1909
00:56:05,967 --> 00:56:07,080
you know?

1910
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:10,080
So she asked to...

1911
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,271
You know, were you guys open

1912
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:15,080
to speak to her,

1913
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,035
and, you know, is...

1914
00:56:16,075 --> 00:56:17,080
- I've never met her.

1915
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,080
- You've never met her?

1916
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,465
- I have never met her.

1917
00:56:21,505 --> 00:56:22,505
- Wow.

1918
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,080
Janet Hubert Whitten,

1919
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,380
ladies and gentlemen.

1920
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,652
- Hey.

1921
00:56:41,692 --> 00:56:42,080
d

1922
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,080
What's up?

1923
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,821
- Seeing Daphne and Janet,

1924
00:57:13,861 --> 00:57:15,080
my two moms,

1925
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,277
the two Aunt Vivs

1926
00:57:17,317 --> 00:57:19,080
come together,

1927
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,080
and they've never met before.

1928
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,477
Seeing them meet

1929
00:57:22,517 --> 00:57:25,100
for the first time and embrace

1930
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:30,080
was the most incredible thing.

1931
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,587
It was like... almost like

1932
00:57:31,627 --> 00:57:33,080
something just released.

1933
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,080
It was so beautiful.

1934
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,080
- That was chilling.

1935
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,080
That was a full-circle moment.

1936
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,470
- It just... it made my heart

1937
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:42,510
really full.

1938
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,259
- I cannot tell you

1939
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,080
how unbelievable

1940
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,960
and wonderful it feels

1941
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,080
that I... I'm overwhelmed.

1942
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,601
- I don't wanna be that guy,

1943
00:57:58,641 --> 00:57:59,080
you know?

1944
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,823
I go out in the world,

1945
00:58:00,863 --> 00:58:02,100
and I, you know,

1946
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:05,633
talk about understanding

1947
00:58:05,673 --> 00:58:08,080
and human relationships

1948
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,080
and then have somebody

1949
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,059
that I hadn't spoken to

1950
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:12,080
in 27 years.

1951
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,705
I just... I'm so happy

1952
00:58:13,745 --> 00:58:15,080
that we were able

1953
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:18,080
to make that reconciliation,

1954
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,925
and I hope other people

1955
00:58:19,965 --> 00:58:22,080
can take something from it.

1956
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,208
What was so great

1957
00:58:24,248 --> 00:58:26,080
about this show

1958
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,080
was how we became a family.

1959
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,087
You kinda fall

1960
00:58:30,127 --> 00:58:33,080
into your roles and...

1961
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,120
- Hey!

1962
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,080
- Oh, that's so awesome!

1963
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,406
- Good to see you.

1964
00:58:47,446 --> 00:58:49,080
- Yes, hello.

1965
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,080
- Nicky, Nicky.

1966
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,080
- Oh, my gosh.

1967
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:52,934
- Hey, my man.

1968
00:58:52,974 --> 00:58:54,080
How are you, buddy?

1969
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:57,080
- My baby grew up.

1970
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,008
- Great to see you.

1971
00:58:58,048 --> 00:58:59,368
- Good to see you too.

1972
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:00,506
- What's up, man?

1973
00:59:00,546 --> 00:59:01,080
- What's up? What's up?

1974
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,585
Man, it's so good

1975
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:04,080
to see everybody.

1976
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,080
This is so surreal.

1977
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,022
I mean, the recreation

1978
00:59:06,062 --> 00:59:07,080
of the set is incredible.

1979
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,310
I mean, I feel like

1980
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:09,080
a kid again.

1981
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,133
- Oh, yeah?

1982
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:14,080
As I look back to this show

1983
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,059
it just captured a time

1984
00:59:16,099 --> 00:59:17,080
in our lives

1985
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:21,227
that is really the golden era

1986
00:59:21,267 --> 00:59:23,100
of my career.

1987
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:24,374
Come on,

1988
00:59:24,414 --> 00:59:25,080
let's go on inside.

1989
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:25,885
Let's check to see

1990
00:59:25,925 --> 00:59:27,080
what's going on on the set,

1991
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:28,271
you know, backstage

1992
00:59:28,311 --> 00:59:29,080
and all that.

1993
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:33,080
- Ah, the Friday night ritual.

1994
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,140
What was it like?

1995
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,926
- We'd go to Will's room.

1996
00:59:36,966 --> 00:59:39,080
He would be jamming in there.

1997
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:39,788
[The Sugarhill Gang's

1998
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:43,080
Ho! Ho! Ho!

1999
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,244
- You'd just start

2000
00:59:44,284 --> 00:59:45,080
hearing music

2001
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:45,426
coming from

2002
00:59:45,466 --> 00:59:46,726
Will's room, booming,

2003
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,300
and you'd just start following

2004
00:59:48,325 --> 00:59:49,325
like the Pied Piper.

2005
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:54,774
- We would

2006
00:59:54,814 --> 00:59:56,080
have music playing.

2007
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,320
We would dance, jam,

2008
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,283
have a great time,

2009
00:59:59,323 --> 01:00:01,080
singing, rapping, whatever.

2010
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,080
- It was just kinda like,

2011
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,033
"Oh, my God, this is

2012
01:00:03,073 --> 01:00:04,080
a Friday night party."

2013
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:11,538
- It was kind of like,

2014
01:00:11,578 --> 01:00:12,080
I think, what you would do

2015
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:12,903
before a concert

2016
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:14,080
or something, you know?

2017
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,911
The whole band gets together

2018
01:00:15,951 --> 01:00:17,080
and says a prayer.

2019
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,615
- I just have to say there's

2020
01:00:18,655 --> 01:00:20,080
not another group of people

2021
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:20,983
that I would rather be

2022
01:00:21,023 --> 01:00:22,096
in this kind of circle with

2023
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:25,080
149-some-odd times.

2024
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,007
- Hey.

2025
01:00:26,047 --> 01:00:27,080
- Yeah.

2026
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:27,584
- Yeah!

2027
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:28,080
- Yeah.

2028
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,163
- Yeah!

2029
01:00:29,203 --> 01:00:30,080
- Man.

2030
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:30,884
- Ditto.

2031
01:00:30,924 --> 01:00:32,080
- Oh, ditto.

2032
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,241
Even though James takes up

2033
01:00:33,281 --> 01:00:34,080
most of the circle.

2034
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,974
- Ditto. As well I should.

2035
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:38,920
- Let's go out there,

2036
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,096
and let's just have some fun.

2037
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,080
Let's give 'em some!

2038
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,185
- We changed the way

2039
01:00:47,225 --> 01:00:49,080
sitcoms were shot.

2040
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:55,271
- People would come

2041
01:00:55,311 --> 01:00:56,311
to the taping

2042
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:58,017
like they were

2043
01:00:58,057 --> 01:00:59,080
going to a club,

2044
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,373
and it was

2045
01:01:00,413 --> 01:01:03,080
a full-on experience.

2046
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:06,080
Yo, yo, yo!

2047
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,504
- We'd have our moment

2048
01:01:09,544 --> 01:01:10,080
together,

2049
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,080
and then we'd head out.

2050
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,057
- And we would get

2051
01:01:13,097 --> 01:01:14,080
to our living room,

2052
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:14,850
and there was

2053
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:16,150
a little dairy basket

2054
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,353
of musical percussion

2055
01:01:18,393 --> 01:01:19,080
instruments.

2056
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,029
- Oh, that's a good one.

2057
01:01:20,069 --> 01:01:21,096
That's a good one, hold on.

2058
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,244
All right, I think

2059
01:01:22,284 --> 01:01:23,080
I'ma do that.

2060
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,029
I'ma do that, all right.

2061
01:01:24,069 --> 01:01:25,096
So this is how we would do.

2062
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:25,925
This is how...

2063
01:01:25,965 --> 01:01:27,080
This is how we do.

2064
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,120
[announcer shouting,

2065
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,186
- We'd each grab one,

2066
01:01:31,226 --> 01:01:33,080
and we would start.

2067
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,080
- Sometimes it was just sticks.

2068
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,646
It was all kinds of stuff

2069
01:01:36,686 --> 01:01:37,080
to bang

2070
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:37,858
on the walls

2071
01:01:37,898 --> 01:01:39,080
and create rhythms.

2072
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,817
- The energy that that created

2073
01:01:40,857 --> 01:01:42,177
for a live performance

2074
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,080
is not to be believed.

2075
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:44,795
- All right, yeah, yeah,

2076
01:01:44,835 --> 01:01:45,080
all right,

2077
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:45,860
we about to go

2078
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,080
on stage with it live.

2079
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,080
The audience is out there.

2080
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:49,603
- We would just

2081
01:01:49,643 --> 01:01:50,643
get the energy

2082
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,693
up to here

2083
01:01:52,733 --> 01:01:56,080
and then, like, surf.

2084
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:59,080
- Miss Tatyana M. Ali!

2085
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,866
- It felt like it was a show.

2086
01:02:00,906 --> 01:02:02,080
It wasn't a TV show.

2087
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,080
It was a show.

2088
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,888
- Alfonso Ribeiro!

2089
01:02:05,928 --> 01:02:07,080
There he is.

2090
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:10,687
Ms. Karyn Parsons!

2091
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,080
Hilary!

2092
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:16,080
Ms. Daphne Maxwell Reid!

2093
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,080
Vivian!

2094
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:22,080
James Avery, Uncle Phil!

2095
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,646
- I wanted to hit the stage

2096
01:02:23,686 --> 01:02:25,080
like a fighter, you know,

2097
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,120
with your theme music

2098
01:02:26,151 --> 01:02:27,080
coming and all that.

2099
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,080
- Mr. Will, Will Smith!

2100
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,080
d

2101
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,418
- Will kinda brought

2102
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:34,080
the energy

2103
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:35,661
that we had in doing

2104
01:02:35,701 --> 01:02:37,080
music to the show,

2105
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:37,916
crowd participation,

2106
01:02:37,956 --> 01:02:39,080
throw your hands in the air.

2107
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,080
- Let me hear you say, "Yeah!"

2108
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,120
Yeah!

2109
01:02:42,156 --> 01:02:44,080
- Say, "Hell yeah!"

2110
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,849
Hell yeah!

2111
01:02:45,889 --> 01:02:48,080
- Everybody scream.

2112
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,164
- Everyone felt like

2113
01:02:51,204 --> 01:02:52,224
they wanted to be

2114
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,268
at a "Fresh Prince" taping

2115
01:02:54,308 --> 01:02:55,080
on a Friday night.

2116
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,528
It was the hottest ticket

2117
01:02:56,568 --> 01:02:58,080
in town, as they called it.

2118
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,080
- Now everybody scream!

2119
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:03,080
d

2120
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,080
Oh, yeah!

2121
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,080
There was nothing like that.

2122
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,100
- He walked right by.

2123
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:10,080
- Aw.

2124
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,080
- Get off me!

2125
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,100
Mwah!

2126
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:32,203
We knew at the end

2127
01:03:32,243 --> 01:03:33,080
of season five

2128
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,286
that there would

2129
01:03:34,326 --> 01:03:36,080
only be one more season.

2130
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,233
- Welcome to the...

2131
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:40,080
Welcome to the final reading.

2132
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,080
- The final.

2133
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,377
- Of "The Fresh Prince

2134
01:03:42,417 --> 01:03:43,080
of Bel-Air."

2135
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,798
All right, gang, here we go.

2136
01:03:44,838 --> 01:03:46,080
Let's give it a read.

2137
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:46,799
We fade in

2138
01:03:46,839 --> 01:03:48,080
for the last time.

2139
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,490
- It was hard to come

2140
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:54,080
to terms with, you know?

2141
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,585
It was six years

2142
01:03:55,625 --> 01:03:57,080
of playing house

2143
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,080
with people I adored.

2144
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:00,603
- We really did

2145
01:04:00,643 --> 01:04:01,080
become family,

2146
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:03,687
and it's something that is

2147
01:04:03,727 --> 01:04:06,080
the essence of the show.

2148
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,848
- It's so strange because now,

2149
01:04:07,888 --> 01:04:09,080
like James was saying

2150
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,562
and what Tatyana was saying,

2151
01:04:10,602 --> 01:04:11,080
everybody,

2152
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:13,221
we're such a family now,

2153
01:04:13,261 --> 01:04:15,080
and it's just so sad.

2154
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,538
This is so sad.

2155
01:04:16,578 --> 01:04:18,080
This is so hard.

2156
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,080
You know, I was an only child,

2157
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:20,785
so here all of a sudden

2158
01:04:20,825 --> 01:04:21,825
I have a...

2159
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,181
I have a brother

2160
01:04:23,221 --> 01:04:24,080
and a sister,

2161
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,270
and I had Will,

2162
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:27,080
who was like a brother,

2163
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,785
and, you know, James Avery

2164
01:04:28,825 --> 01:04:30,080
took being my father

2165
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,120
very seriously.

2166
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,080
He called me "daughter."

2167
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,272
- Alfonso was absolutely

2168
01:04:35,312 --> 01:04:37,080
a big brother to me.

2169
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,183
Karyn is just a woman

2170
01:04:39,223 --> 01:04:42,080
that I look up to and admire.

2171
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,627
- A lot of good times

2172
01:04:49,667 --> 01:04:51,080
spent in this house.

2173
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,100
- A lifetime's worth.

2174
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,159
- I'm not gonna miss

2175
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:56,080
the house though.

2176
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,211
I'ma... I'ma miss all the people

2177
01:04:57,235 --> 01:04:58,080
that lived in the house.

2178
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,682
You know, but I want you

2179
01:04:59,722 --> 01:05:01,080
to call me on Sundays

2180
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:01,517
when you call

2181
01:05:01,557 --> 01:05:02,577
the rest of the...

2182
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:03,512
Well, I want you

2183
01:05:03,552 --> 01:05:04,080
to call me on Sundays

2184
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,211
when you call the rest

2185
01:05:05,251 --> 01:05:06,271
of your children.

2186
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:08,005
I love you, Uncle Phil,

2187
01:05:08,045 --> 01:05:09,096
and I don't wanna lose you,

2188
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,080
I mean, any of you.

2189
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,080
- They embrace.

2190
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,120
- Think about, like,

2191
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:14,080
people that you see

2192
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,575
every single day

2193
01:05:15,615 --> 01:05:18,080
for six years of your life,

2194
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,472
in the... you see them more

2195
01:05:19,512 --> 01:05:21,080
than you see your own family.

2196
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,080
- Okay, and we're out.

2197
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,056
- This has been very unique

2198
01:05:32,096 --> 01:05:33,080
for all of us,

2199
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,080
and I can honestly say,

2200
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,154
'cause I've been working

2201
01:05:35,194 --> 01:05:36,080
about 15 years or so,

2202
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,942
I don't know, but this has been

2203
01:05:37,982 --> 01:05:39,122
the best experience

2204
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:41,080
in terms of a TV show,

2205
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,132
in terms of people

2206
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:46,080
and friends and happiness,

2207
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,120
and I've got to stop now.

2208
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:49,080
Okay.

2209
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,084
- Thank you.

2210
01:05:50,124 --> 01:05:51,080
- All right.

2211
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,472
- You know, it was a very

2212
01:05:52,512 --> 01:05:54,080
difficult week for all of us,

2213
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,158
knowing that we were never

2214
01:05:55,182 --> 01:05:56,080
gonna be together again

2215
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,080
like that ever again.

2216
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,972
- You know, we've been...

2217
01:06:00,012 --> 01:06:02,080
We've been blessed in a way

2218
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,478
that a lot of people

2219
01:06:03,518 --> 01:06:05,080
don't get to experience

2220
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,901
and to be able to do

2221
01:06:06,941 --> 01:06:08,080
what we love,

2222
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:10,141
but to also put things out

2223
01:06:10,181 --> 01:06:11,080
in the world

2224
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:13,080
that display our love.

2225
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,510
And I've done a lot

2226
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:16,080
of things in my life,

2227
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:16,967
and I just want

2228
01:06:17,007 --> 01:06:18,080
to thank all of you

2229
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,704
for making this

2230
01:06:19,744 --> 01:06:22,080
the most beautiful job

2231
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,585
and life experience

2232
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:25,080
that I've ever had.

2233
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,164
Y'all know that this

2234
01:06:28,204 --> 01:06:29,080
the final episode

2235
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,741
of "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"

2236
01:06:30,781 --> 01:06:31,080
right?

2237
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,354
You know, it's sad,

2238
01:06:32,394 --> 01:06:34,080
but we had a six-year run,

2239
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:34,952
so we would like

2240
01:06:34,992 --> 01:06:36,080
for y'all to sit back

2241
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,587
and enjoy the second half

2242
01:06:37,627 --> 01:06:39,080
of what you just watched.

2243
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:39,905
Ladies and gentlemen,

2244
01:06:39,945 --> 01:06:41,096
"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"

2245
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,207
for the last time,

2246
01:06:42,247 --> 01:06:43,080
coming at you.

2247
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,797
Peace!

2248
01:06:44,837 --> 01:06:45,080
d

2249
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,221
The final week

2250
01:06:46,261 --> 01:06:48,080
was interesting for me.

2251
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,080
It was all... it was all...

2252
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:50,750
It's still...

2253
01:06:50,790 --> 01:06:52,080
It was fuzzy in my mind.

2254
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,851
I think that's part

2255
01:06:53,891 --> 01:06:56,080
of my emotional defense.

2256
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:59,080
I always live in the future.

2257
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:01,080
My mind is always

2258
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,403
in the next space,

2259
01:07:02,443 --> 01:07:04,080
and I think as a child,

2260
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,588
that's how I learned to avoid

2261
01:07:06,628 --> 01:07:09,080
the pain of a present moment.

2262
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:12,080
- Counting, three, two.

2263
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,120
- Oh, God.

2264
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:16,862
- Good start, good start,

2265
01:07:16,902 --> 01:07:18,080
good start.

2266
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,022
I've see pictures from

2267
01:07:19,062 --> 01:07:20,080
that week and everything,

2268
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,734
and it's like,

2269
01:07:22,774 --> 01:07:27,080
it was such a deeply...

2270
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,080
painful goodbye.

2271
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,139
- Being pulled away

2272
01:07:33,179 --> 01:07:34,080
from these people

2273
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,080
was really difficult.

2274
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,560
I loved being with them,

2275
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:38,580
and we'd also gone through

2276
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:39,080
something so life-changing

2277
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,042
for all of us,

2278
01:07:40,082 --> 01:07:42,080
so we were bonded in this way.

2279
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:45,080
- I wasn't in the last scene.

2280
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:45,835
I was in one

2281
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:47,080
of the early scenes,

2282
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,870
and right after I did my scene,

2283
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:50,170
I took a deep breath,

2284
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,020
and I waited for the director

2285
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:55,080
to say, "Clear, and moving on,"

2286
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:56,639
and when he said, "Moving on,"

2287
01:07:56,679 --> 01:07:58,080
I slowly walked off the set,

2288
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,452
went in the dressing room,

2289
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,080
grabbed my bag, got in the car,

2290
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,980
and drove to the airport

2291
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:04,080
and flew home.

2292
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,080
I couldn't... I couldn't do it.

2293
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,539
- All of my hu...

2294
01:08:07,579 --> 01:08:09,080
I mean, 11 to 17,

2295
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,418
it's such a huge...

2296
01:08:10,458 --> 01:08:11,080
You know,

2297
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,055
you grow so much

2298
01:08:12,095 --> 01:08:13,095
during that time.

2299
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,080
I did it all with them,

2300
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:14,987
and when I saw

2301
01:08:15,027 --> 01:08:16,080
that stage empty,

2302
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,837
it was just like...

2303
01:08:17,877 --> 01:08:20,080
I could barely breathe.

2304
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,405
- It didn't come to a head

2305
01:08:22,445 --> 01:08:25,080
until the last scene shooting,

2306
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,348
and we knew that

2307
01:08:26,388 --> 01:08:28,080
this was the last time

2308
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,301
we were gonna hug

2309
01:08:29,341 --> 01:08:31,080
these people on this set.

2310
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,753
- Leaving is like leaving

2311
01:08:32,793 --> 01:08:34,080
a grand, old friend.

2312
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,782
- Having to walk off the set,

2313
01:08:36,822 --> 01:08:38,080
that was hard.

2314
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,086
You know, it was like

2315
01:08:39,126 --> 01:08:40,080
I was out of my body,

2316
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,895
watching myself walk all

2317
01:08:41,935 --> 01:08:44,100
the way out and not stopping,

2318
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:48,080
and then I was out of frame,

2319
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,080
and I was done.

2320
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:51,492
- I remember that when

2321
01:08:51,532 --> 01:08:53,080
it was all said and done,

2322
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,500
I couldn't stop crying.

2323
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:56,080
- You okay?

2324
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,870
- Yeah, yeah, no, no, I'm cool.

2325
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:59,080
I'm cool, Uncle Phil.

2326
01:08:59,120 --> 01:08:59,912
You know, it's just

2327
01:08:59,952 --> 01:09:01,080
when I first came out here,

2328
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:04,080
you know, I was a relative.

2329
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:05,243
Been here for the past

2330
01:09:05,283 --> 01:09:06,080
six years, like,

2331
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:09,080
we've been family.

2332
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,116
I just don't wanna go back to

2333
01:09:11,156 --> 01:09:13,080
being just a relative again.

2334
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,053
I mean, I lived

2335
01:09:16,093 --> 01:09:17,093
without a father

2336
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,165
and without brothers

2337
01:09:19,205 --> 01:09:22,080
and sisters and all of that.

2338
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:25,080
I like this life better.

2339
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,144
- Hey, who turned

2340
01:09:49,184 --> 01:09:50,184
out the lights?

2341
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,080
Where is everybody?

2342
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,080
d

2343
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:07,537
- I am definitely

2344
01:10:07,577 --> 01:10:09,100
gonna miss you, C.

2345
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:16,080
d

2346
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:25,030
- We've been a part

2347
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:26,080
of creating something

2348
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,745
that has touched millions

2349
01:10:28,785 --> 01:10:31,080
and millions of hearts

2350
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,680
around the world,

2351
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,080
and on this set

2352
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:36,241
I learned how to lead

2353
01:10:36,281 --> 01:10:38,080
my life, you know?

2354
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,901
I figured out who I wanted

2355
01:10:39,941 --> 01:10:41,080
to be on this set

2356
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,660
with all of you

2357
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:45,080
making this show, so...

2358
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,055
This was family.

2359
01:10:46,095 --> 01:10:47,115
- This is family.

2360
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:48,868
- This is family.

2361
01:10:48,908 --> 01:10:50,080
- I love you guys so much.

2362
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,465
You have no idea.

2363
01:10:51,505 --> 01:10:53,080
I think... no, you do.

2364
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,981
- I think the continuing legacy

2365
01:10:57,021 --> 01:10:58,080
for "Fresh Prince"

2366
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,460
will simply be that

2367
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:03,080
we changed television

2368
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,080
in a positive way

2369
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,499
and that we will go down

2370
01:11:06,539 --> 01:11:07,080
in history

2371
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,468
as one of the best

2372
01:11:08,508 --> 01:11:10,080
to have ever done it.

2373
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:10,926
- I mean, it's...

2374
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:12,080
It's become legendary.

2375
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,419
It has become really,

2376
01:11:14,459 --> 01:11:16,080
really special.

2377
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:17,080
- We were so fortunate.

2378
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,184
It was like

2379
01:11:18,224 --> 01:11:20,080
no experience ever,

2380
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:22,080
but I had it.

2381
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,866
- We had no idea

2382
01:11:23,906 --> 01:11:26,080
that it was gonna be

2383
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,588
the iconic show

2384
01:11:27,628 --> 01:11:29,080
that it became.

2385
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,295
- While we were filming

2386
01:11:30,335 --> 01:11:31,080
this, you know,

2387
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,080
Will tweeted out a picture,

2388
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,231
and I saw a lot of posts

2389
01:11:34,271 --> 01:11:35,080
about the picture,

2390
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,389
and a lot of people responded,

2391
01:11:36,429 --> 01:11:37,080
and people said,

2392
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:40,080
#BlackExcellence, right?

2393
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,970
And it made me think about

2394
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:44,080
what our show meant to people

2395
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:46,199
and why it's lasted

2396
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:47,080
so long,

2397
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,235
and I don't want it

2398
01:11:48,275 --> 01:11:49,080
to be mistaken

2399
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,348
that the excellence part

2400
01:11:50,388 --> 01:11:51,080
is the wealth.

2401
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:54,080
That part is the fantasy.

2402
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,619
The excellence was the way

2403
01:11:55,659 --> 01:11:57,080
that we loved each other.

2404
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,125
- You know, the... the thing

2405
01:11:59,165 --> 01:12:01,080
that's difficult is that,

2406
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,556
you know, we're a family,

2407
01:12:02,596 --> 01:12:03,080
you know?

2408
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,080
Of course it's a TV show,

2409
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:05,750
and, you know,

2410
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:07,080
we're only playing a family,

2411
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,377
but you really develop

2412
01:12:09,417 --> 01:12:12,080
family-like relationships.

2413
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,419
You know, it was such

2414
01:12:14,459 --> 01:12:16,080
a beautiful way

2415
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,080
to have these memories

2416
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,211
and to be able to say goodbye

2417
01:12:20,251 --> 01:12:21,080
to this show

2418
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,771
and to this section

2419
01:12:22,811 --> 01:12:25,080
of our lives with dignity.

2420
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:25,958
- I think we all...

2421
01:12:25,998 --> 01:12:27,080
You know, to an extent,

2422
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,509
we've all gone off

2423
01:12:28,549 --> 01:12:30,080
and lived our lives,

2424
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,723
but there will always be

2425
01:12:31,763 --> 01:12:33,080
a piece of all of us

2426
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,800
in that living room,

2427
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,080
and it was nice

2428
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,080
for all of us to share it

2429
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:41,080
for one more day.

2430
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:47,934
- Y'all ready?

2431
01:12:47,974 --> 01:12:49,080
Let's go, let's go!

2432
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,080
Hit it, Snazz!

2433
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,085
["The Fresh Prince

2434
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,019
- One thing that always

2435
01:13:06,059 --> 01:13:07,096
bugged me about the show...

2436
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,149
Nothing bugged me

2437
01:13:08,189 --> 01:13:09,080
about the show.

2438
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:09,613
Well, I guess the one thing

2439
01:13:09,653 --> 01:13:10,080
that bugged me is that...

2440
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,120
[Tom Jones'

2441
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,317
- Uh-oh.

2442
01:13:13,357 --> 01:13:14,357
- Oh!

2443
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:15,562
- We doing it?

2444
01:13:15,602 --> 01:13:16,080
- What you got?

2445
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,178
What you got? What you got?

2446
01:13:17,202 --> 01:13:18,080
- When are we doing it?

2447
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,127
- I never could do this.

2448
01:13:19,167 --> 01:13:20,080
I never could do this.

2449
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:21,860
- You gotta start right here.

2450
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,080
- Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

2451
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,080
- Now do the steps.

2452
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:43,898
- There it is

2453
01:13:43,938 --> 01:13:45,080
right there, y'all.

2454
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,080
Bring it in right there.

2455
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:47,805
On three.

2456
01:13:47,845 --> 01:13:49,080
One, two, three!

2457
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:52,080
Yes!

2458
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:54,080
D f

2459
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,162
- Are we done?

2460
01:13:55,202 --> 01:13:56,080
- That's it.

2461
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:56,587
- That's it?

2462
01:13:56,627 --> 01:13:57,080
- That's it.

2463
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:57,671
- Oh.

2464
01:13:57,711 --> 01:13:59,080
- Thank you.

2465
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,120
- See you in ten years.

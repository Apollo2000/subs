It's getting closer,
but it's not getting any nicer.

34
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:57,875
Oh, wow.

35
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,416
It did not look like this
on the internet.

36
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,291
Yeah, I don't remember
it being this sausage color.

37
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,583
Oh, man, it's a dump!

38
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,791
It's not so bad.

39
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:24,208
We can fix it.

40
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:32,583
We can start with that.

41
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,916
Okay, that's the last box, Mum.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Thanks, Jack.
I'm gonna take a look at the new shop.

43
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,963
How about you ride down,
and I'll see you there?

44
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,041
No worries, Mum.

45
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,416
- Hey.
- Hey.

46
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,750
Need some help?

47
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,625
Actually, you have an invite.

48
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,966
Her mum heard
we moved into town.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,375
Go-karts are for kids, Mum.

50
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,041
Uh, you're a kid.

51
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:57,125
I prefer you driving one of those
than pulling cupcakes in my car.

52
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,310
- They're called donuts, thank you.
- I know what they're called.

53
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:03,041
- Stop doing them.
- I won't even know anyone.

54
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,000
That's the point.

55
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,708
You'll go to school with these kids
once the holidays are over.

56
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:09,708
I don't know.

57
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,375
Look, here are your choices.

58
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,541
You either go to the party,

59
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,208
or you can stay here
and help me all afternoon.

You know, because a platypus lays eggs
and produces milk,

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,500
it's the only animal
that can make its own custard.

70
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,583
Wait. Are you laughing <i>with </i>me or <i>at </i>me?

71
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:09,666
With you. Yeah.

72
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,291
I'm Colin. Colin Faber.

73
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,625
Jack. Jack Hooper. Nice to meet you.

74
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,291
They're so fast.

75
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,500
They are, aren't they?

76
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,791
I'm a bit nervous
about driving one of these things.

77
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,458
- I've never done it before.
- Neither have I.

78
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,625
But I'm sure it'll be all right.

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Come on.

80
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,416
Hey, it'll be an adventure.

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,041
Who's the dude man?

82
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,750
Dean Zeta.

83
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,500
State kart champion.

84
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,541
Everyone thinks
he'll win Nationals this year.

85
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:52,228
Remember when I asked you
if you were laughing with me or at me?

86
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:53,916
It was, like, one minute ago.

87
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,920
Yeah, well, he and his mates
laugh <i>at </i>me.

88
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,500
Hey, out of the way.

89
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,458
I know. They're dim-witted vulgarians,

90
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,250
but I prefer to just ignore them
and get on with my day.

91
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,416
Come on.

92
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,375
That's embarrassing.

93
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,458
Woo-hoo!

94
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,708
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

95
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,916
Yeah!

96
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
How you going?

97
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,166
Woo!

98
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,083
Here I come, dude man!

99
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,125
Woo-hoo!

100
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,458
Yeah!

101
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,875
Come on.

102
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Move!

103
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,541
<i>Show no fear, mate.</i>

104
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,166
Hey, Patrick.

105
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,125
Mike.

106
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:17,166
Thanks for holding the party here.
I appreciate the business.

107
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:18,791
Yeah, of course.

108
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,541
Have you thought anymore
about coaching my boy?

109
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,166
Can't do it.

110
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,845
Dean has a real shot at Nationals
this year.

111
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,791
All he needs someone with experience
to help him get ready.

112
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,375
And you'd make a great asset to our team,
Patrick.

113
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,625
Well, like I said, that's...

114
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,291
not gonna happen.

115
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:39,583
Why not?

116
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:43,208
Because your boy
doesn't have enough talent and...

117
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,000
I can't teach that.

118
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,041
Yeah.

119
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,125
Hey.

120
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,791
How long have you been karting?

121
00:08:58,875 --> 00:08:59,875
Um...

122
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,583
about ten minutes.

123
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,333
- Really?
- Yeah.

124
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,500
You were pretty good.

125
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,250
I don't know. I mean, I slid off.

126
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,583
That's because you went
on the outside of the track.

127
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,375
That's where the marbles are.

128
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,625
There were marbles on the track?

129
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,875
Not those kind of marbles.

130
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,958
All the loose bits of dirt and rubber
from the tires are swept onto the outside,

131
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,791
and when you drive over them,
they're super slippery.

132
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:24,875
Huh.

133
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:25,916
Um, I'm Jack.

134
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,166
- Mandy.
- Nice to meet you.

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So you, uh...

136
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:34,875
race karts?

137
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,833
Yeah, but I prefer to make 'em go faster.

138
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,166
So you're like a mechanic?

139
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,750
Well, they're actually called
chief engineers, but yeah.

140
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,125
I want to work in Formula 1 one day.

141
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,541
- Cool.
- Mandy.

142
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,125
Ready with the cake.

143
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Okay.

144
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,520
- All right, I'll see you soon.
- Yeah.

145
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,666
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

146
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,166
- That's a nice dog.
- Thanks.

147
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,330
Looks like he's got rabies.

148
00:09:58,833 --> 00:09:59,833
What's your problem?

149
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,541
When you spun off, you nearly took me out.

150
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,458
I think you're mad
because I almost beat you.

151
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,833
Ooh.

152
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,250
See, that would never happen.

153
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,541
I had you.

154
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:10,958
And you know it.

155
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,125
Stay out of my way.

156
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,416
That's your first and only warning.

157
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,791
I really showed him, huh?

158
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:37,000

160
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,125
What's with the matching vests?

161
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,458
That's Mandy's mum and dad.

162
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,583
He's like a race car guy. Owns a team.

163
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,083
- Hip hip...
- Hooray!

164
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,476
- Hip hip...
- Hooray!

165
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,125
- Hip hip...
- Hooray!

166
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,958
What's dude man doing there?

167
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,625
Oh, Dean? He's Mandy's brother.

168
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,791
Of course he is.

169
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,958
Never gonna beat you, am I, Dad?

170
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:28,916
Evening, Dennis.

171
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,223
After everything that happened in Sydney,

172
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,416
you take my car again,
two days after we get here.

173
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,333
Mum, I was in the middle of nowhere.

174
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,375
I mean, there was no traffic.

175
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,541
And I'm driving a station wagon.

176
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:46,833
Isn't that true?

177
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,625
Um...

178
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,125
You were chucking donuts
in an empty car park, son.

179
00:12:58,791 --> 00:12:59,991
Without a license.

180
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,958
I apologize, officer.
It will not happen again.

181
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:05,875
Well...

182
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,125
considering there was no harm done,

183
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm prepared to let you off
with a warning.

184
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,833
A stern warning.

185
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:17,083
If I catch you at it again,
you will be in very hot water.

186
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Understood?

187
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,208
Well, I should hit the road.

188
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,208
The old frog and toad.

189
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:35,458
Uh, I'm...

190
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,500
Officer Barry Johansen...

191
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,083
- by the way.
- Sorry. Christie Hooper.

192
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,125
Pleasure.

193
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,666
Have you just moved into town?

194
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,125
Yeah, we're taking a lease
on a shop on Queen Street.

195
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,541
- Really?
- Yes.

196
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:50,875
That's great.

197
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,458
Well, I might see you around sometime,
at some point.

198
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
In the future...

199
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,333
perhaps.

200
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,416
Okay.

201
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,458
Okay.

202
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,333
Evening.

203
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,783
Thank you, officer.

204
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,433
- Bye, Barry.
- Jack!

205
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:07,791
What?

206
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,250
You're doing donuts again?

207
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:16,666
What's going on?

208
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,375
Nothing.

209
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,375
Well, why do you keep doing it?

210
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:21,916
I don't know.

211
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,333
That's not a good enough reason, mate.

212
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,958
One day, your luck's gonna run out.

213
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,458
And it won't end well.

214
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,458
I'm hoping that we can build a life here.

215
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,708
You know you can tell me anything.

216
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,291
- Maybe you want to talk to me about Dad...
- Mum, I'm fine.

217
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,250
Look. I got sausage because it matches
the color of this house.

218
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,458
Far out. It's so expensive.

219
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:35,916
So...

220
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,541
you've been bitten by the racing bug.

221
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,430
Is that when you can't stop thinking
about how much of a rush it is?

222
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,059
And you feel like
it's what you were put on earth to do?

223
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,083
That's it.

224
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:47,916
Then I've been bitten.

225
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,625
Well...

226
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,041
I think that's great.

227
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:54,916
Now...

228
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,958
I reckon you should turn around...

229
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,750
go home...

230
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,541
and never speak of it again.

231
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:04,791
Excuse me?

232
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,875
You had one three-lap race
in which you spun off and finished last,

233
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,791
and now you want to make it
your life's work?

234
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,458
You know what would be a better idea?

235
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,750
Collect every dollar you have,

236
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,125
and your parents have,
and your friends have...

237
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,708
and buy the nicest boat you can.

238
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,625
Park it in the middle of the harbor...

239
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,333
blow it up...

240
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:25,833
and watch it sink.

241
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,343
That'd be a better use
of your time and money

242
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,975
than trying to make it as a race driver.

243
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,250
Wow.

244
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:33,708
You're the worst.

245
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,791
Hit the bricks, kid.
You don't want this life.

246
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,253
And your prices are too high.

247
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,458
No wonder no one's here.

248
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,750
We don't open for three hours.

249
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,291
Well, that explains it then.

250
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:51,916
Actually...

251
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,666
I do want this life.

252
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,083
That's not the problem.

253
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,416
I don't have enough money to pay you
to drive here.

254
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,958
And when I say enough, I mean any.

255
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:02,958
It's not a charity.

256
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,046
I've got an idea that could work
for both of us.

257
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:10,958
I'm listening.

258
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,083
Clearly, this place needs some TLC.

259
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,500
Is that right?

260
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:20,166
So employ me to help out,
but instead of paying me...

261
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,166
let me drive three laps of the track
for every hour I work.

262
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,385
- What's happening right now?
- I'm thinking.

263
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,583
One lap.

264
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,291
And only when I say.

265
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,750
- Three, because the track is short.
- One, because of fuel costs.

266
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,684
Three, and didn't you hear
what I said about the track being...

267
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,083
One. And I'm not loving this backchat.

268
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,375
- Three.
- Two.

269
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,458
Deal.

270
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,208
- Would have done it for one.
- Would have agreed to three.

271
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,291
All right, you can start now.

272
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:11,541
What's this for?

273
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,458
When the track gets dusty,
it's too slippery to race on.

274
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,666
You're gonna spray it with water
to keep it intact.

275
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,125
You want me to spray the whole track
using this?

276
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,208
Indeed I do.

277
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,041
Why don't we use
that enormous water truck?

278
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:28,000
I trust this backchat won't be
an ongoing feature of our conversation.

279
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,958
Make sure you spray evenly.

280
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,500
And one more thing.

281
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,416
Do not enter my caravan
without an invitation.

282
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,583
Ever. You understand?

283
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:39,541
Yep.

284
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,625
Hey. I googled you last night.

285
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,541
It said you used to race cars.

286
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,083
Won some big stuff.

287
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,166
Less talking, more spraying.

288
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,083
Get to it. You're burning sunlight.
Chop chop.

289
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,250

290

293
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,625
Thanks, Betsy.

294
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,416
Whoa!

295
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,250
Hey, <i>Mamasita.</i>

296
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:24,934
- Is that for me?
- Mm-hmm.

297
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,166
Oh, thank you.

298
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,250
Mmm!

299
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,708
Oh, that's good stuff.

300
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:31,958
Yeah, that's good.

301
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,375
So I, um...

302
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:34,916
I got a job today.

303
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,625
- Really?
- Yeah. At that kart place.

304
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,250
Oh, well done, you. That's great.

305
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,416
Not seeing a water sprayer.

306
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:41,791
This mean I get to drive?

307
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,666
I can't drive with this thing on.

308
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,958
You've got until sunset
to paint the garage with it.

309
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,458
Dude!

310
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,666
- Is this a joke?
- No backchat.

311
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:59,375
Get to it. You're burning sunlight.
Chop chop.

312
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,500
And don't call me "dude."

313
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,708
"You're burning sunlight."

314
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,166
Really, Mr. Miyagi?

315
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:20,791
Well...

316
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,875
why don't you shove this helmet...

317
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,958
where there is no sunlight?

318
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,375
Yes!

319
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,541
- Finally.
- Good.

320
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,291
Now do the inside.

321
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,666
That's right. Slow down, mate.

322
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,083
Hi, Barry.

323
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,833
Does this mean I get to drive?

324
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,125
I need you to wash all these.

325
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:57,583
And...

326
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,818
you're gonna do it with your feet.

327
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:00,875
My feet?

328
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,750
Your feet.

329
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,500
You know that's super weird, right?

330
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:06,583
No backchat.

331
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:10,541
Get to it. You're burning sunlight.
Chop chop.

332
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,583
<i>♪ We are the way out ♪</i>

333
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,166
<i>♪ We are the ones you loathe ♪</i>

334
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,458
<i>♪ Call us the wrong crowd ♪</i>

335
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,791
<i>♪ We'll never walk alone ♪</i>

336
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,166
Can't you offset the top from the center
and add more caster?

337
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:53,458
I know it's unconventional,

338
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:56,833
but if you tune it right, it's worth
at least a tenth of a second a lap.

339
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,625
Really? Is that what you reckon?

340
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,875
If that were true,
then why aren't other teams doing it?

341
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:06,875
'Cause they lack imagination?

342
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,228
I think we'll stick with what we know.

343
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:10,875
It's worked so far.

344
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,326
Leroy wouldn't know a fast kart
if it was stapled to...

345
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,375
Hey.

346
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,625
He has 20 years of experience.

347
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,125
And he's still wrong. Amazing.

348
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:29,625
Put me in charge of the kart.
I'll be a better chief engineer.

349
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,625
Sweetheart, you know it's not that simple.

350
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:37,583
How am I gonna learn if I never do it?

351
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,666
Maybe you'll get your chance one day.

352
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:43,008
But right now we all need to focus
on our jobs

353
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:44,458
so your brother wins Nationals.

354
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,750
I need to do some driving, man.

355
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,083
Regional championships are next week.

356
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:51,666
Regionals?

357
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:52,833
No.

358
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,916
You've got a lot of work to do
before you're ready to race.

359
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Then why am I spraying the track?

360
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,791
Or painting the walls with my head?

361
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,500
I need to do some driving.

362
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,916
And you owe me 100 laps.

363
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,916
You'll drive when I say so.

364
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:08,458
All right?

365
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:09,875
We have a deal.

366
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,416
Well, I'm canceling it.

367
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,666
You can't cancel it, it's a deal.

368
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,500
Hello? Is this thing on?

369
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:23,791
It's canceled.

370
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,250
Hooper out.

371
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,375
You're not racing in Regionals.

372
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,291
But I will let you drive.

373
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,583
Today, all right?

374
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,666
All 100 laps.

375
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:39,791
No stops.

376
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:41,500
And when you're finished...

377
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,333
you're gonna take everything
inside that shed and put it in the bin.

378
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:48,041
I'm gonna turn that into a snack bar.

379
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:49,666
Deal?

380
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:51,208
Yeah.

381
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,250
- Yes?
- Yes!

382
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,291
Good!

383
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,333
Get to it.

384
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,380
- You're burning sunlight... Chop...
- Yeah, sunlight, I know. Chop chop.

385
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:08,458
Woo!

386
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Woo!

387
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,291
Woo-hoo-hoo!

388
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:42,333
Looks like one of the Transformers
threw up.

389
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,208
Yep.

390
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:45,833
Know much about mechanical stuff?

391
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Me neither.

392
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,833
So, what do we do?

393
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:54,875
I've got an idea.

394
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,458
Hey.

395
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:10,625
What?

396
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:12,416
Wait! It's Jack!

397
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:15,291
Man, you scared the hell out of me.

398
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:17,750
Why are you leaping out of shadows?

399
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:19,392
- You couldn't see me?
- They're shadows!

400
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:20,958
Of course I couldn't see you!

401
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:22,916
What are you doing here?

402
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,916
Can you help me get my kart ready
to race at Regionals?

403
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:28,776
And I don't have any money.

404
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:30,583
So I can't pay you.

405
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,750
In fact...

406
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:35,625
it could end up costing you money.

407
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:38,125
So what do you say?

408
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:40,791
Well, since you put it like that...

409
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:44,583
Why are you asking <i>me?</i>

410
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:47,583
Well, I don't know anything about karts.

411
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,625
And I don't know anyone who does,

412
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:50,708
except for you.

413
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:54,833
So you're asking me
because you didn't have any other choices?

414
00:27:54,916 --> 00:27:55,916
Absolutely.

415
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,958
And that I think you'd do a good job.

416
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:02,791
- I'll do it, but with one stipulation.
- Okay.

417
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:05,833
I'm chief engineer.
That means I'm in charge of the kart.

418
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:07,458
Deal.

419
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:09,583
See you tomorrow?

420
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:10,958
We'll see!

421
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:13,083
Cool.

422
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:16,291
Woo!

423
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,083
You want to race <i>this</i>
at Regionals?

424
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,333
It looks like it was hit by a truck.

425
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:28,083
Can you fix it?

426
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,958
Was it hit by a truck?

427
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:33,125
That's the way we found it.

428
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:36,625
I can fix it.

429
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,916
Let's start by sorting everything.

430
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Put the engine parts there,
the brake parts there,

431
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:43,708
the steering parts here,
and the exhaust parts here.

432
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:50,250
Clearly, we need to start from basics.

433
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:52,833
Okay, listen closely.
There'll be an exam afterwards.

434
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:55,083
- That's an axle...
- Uh, Mandy?

435
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,250
Yes, Colin?

436
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:00,500
Will there really be an exam?

437
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:05,583
No, Colin.
That's the axle. This is the brake disc.

438
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:07,625
- She's so cool.
- That's the brake caliper...

439
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:09,541
- I'm just happy there isn't an exam.
- Yeah.

440
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:25,333
It's so...

441
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:26,875
ugly.

442
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,333
It's not ugly.

443
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:30,000
You know what's ugly?

444
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
Slow. And this ain't slow.

445
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,583
So where do we test drive it?

446
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:38,916
Are you sure
we're meant to be driving on this?

447
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,416
Sometimes you don't ask
for permission, Col.

448
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,291
You just do it and apologize later.

449
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:46,625
Now, this is a test drive,
so take it slow.

450
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:47,708
I hear you.

451
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,708
I don't think he heard you.

452
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,750
Idiot!

453
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:18,666
Woo-hoo!

454
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:25,833
Woo!

455
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:33,833
Woo!

456
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:52,750
Well, gentlemen, it's been real.

457
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:55,833
- See you at the track tomorrow?
- Yeah...

458
00:30:56,916 --> 00:30:59,041
about that. This was a one-off.

459
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,125
If my dad finds out
I helped a rival team...

460
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,666
he'll go off like a frog in a sock.

461
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,375
- Thanks.
- No worries.

462
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:15,000
Don't go on the outside of the track
like you did at my party.

463
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:18,500
If you get on the marbles,
you will slide off.

464
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:30,958
Hey, what if we get you a funnel?

465
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:33,361
That'd be faster.
Then I could just pour it right in there.

466
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:38,015
Are you working at that kart place today?

467
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:39,291
Um, no.

468
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:40,916
Today's my first race.

469
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:44,416
Oh, really?

470
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,500
- Right.
- Yeah.

471
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:46,916
First race.

472
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:49,500
Well, that's cool.

473
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:52,291
I'll get Colin to FaceTime you.

474
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:55,583
He'll FaceTime me?

475
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,000
Yeah.

476
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,291
Just answer the call.

477
00:31:58,791 --> 00:31:59,791
Race starts at 11:00.

478
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:02,125
- Wish me luck.
- Luck.

479
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:04,166
- Bye.
- Have fun!

480
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:28,291
Hey.

481
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:29,708
Out of the way.

482
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,880
You know you can't let them
treat you like that.

483
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,708
I know.
I just don't know what to do about it.

484
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:40,625
You want to go home?

485
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:44,125
No way.
I don't want to miss out on an adventure.

486
00:32:45,541 --> 00:32:46,541
Yeah, mate.

487
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:48,166
<i>After the KA3 qualifying session,</i>

488
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:51,750
title favorite Dean Zeta
is in first place!

489
00:32:51,833 --> 00:32:55,583
<i>In second is Jess Hoyt,
with Juliet Kay a solid third.</i>

490
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:57,875
<i>Top three finishers in the upcoming final</i>

491
00:32:57,958 --> 00:33:00,375
<i>move straight through
to the State Championships.</i>

492
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:06,208
I attack until I lead.
I take no prisoners.

493
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:07,625
I never concede.

494
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:10,791
Whoever said winning isn't everything
is a fool who knows nothing.

495
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:11,958
I am unbeatable.

496
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:15,041
Go do your thing.

497
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:25,958
<i>This race is in the KA3 class.</i>

498
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:27,125
<i>And just a reminder,</i>

499
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:30,541
the top three finishers go straight
through to the State Championship.

500
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:35,833
Come on, Jack.

501
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:38,833
It's my son's first race today.

502
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,541
- Oh, how nice.
- Yeah.

503
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:42,916
<i>Okay, here they come, folks, in formation.
Two by two.</i>

504
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,083
<i>We're getting set for a start.
Green light's on.</i>

505
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:48,541
<i>We're off and racing, folks!</i>

506
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:53,791
<i>Oh! That was a lunge, with a capital L!</i>

507
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:56,583
<i>Dean Zeta takes the lead,
and he's streaking away.</i>

508
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:20,458
<i>And young Hooper now thunders through
into tenth place.</i>

509
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:22,875
<i>- He's inside, he's outside.</i>
- That's good.

510
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:25,375
<i>He is wearing this go-kart
like an old suit!</i>

511
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:27,375
They're quite zippy, aren't they?

512
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:28,916
Is it safe?

513
00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:30,158
Well, they're wearing helmets.

514
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:35,708
<i>Into ninth.</i>

515
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:37,291
<i>From ninth to eighth.</i>

516
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:41,750
<i>He's going after the champagne,
the glory, and the gold!</i>

517
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:45,458
<i>Come on, Hooper! You can do it, son!</i>

518
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:57,541
<i>He's moving up into fifth.</i>

519
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:59,416
<i>- Oh, this is sensational.</i>
- Keep going.

520
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,416
Yes, Dean! Yes!

521
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,083
<i>He uses the whole of the track.</i>

522
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,916
<i>He's got his eyes on first place for sure.</i>

523
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:33,875
<i>- Jack Hooper takes fourth.</i>
- Come on, get out of the way!

524
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:38,416
<i>Show no fear, mate.</i>

525
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,060
<i>Don't go on the outside
of the track. You will slide off.</i>

526
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:05,458
Yeah!

527
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:06,541
<i>Dean Zeta, first.</i>

528
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,083
<i>Jack Hooper, third.</i>

529
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:10,083
Come on, Dean! Go!

530
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:22,458
What the hell are you doing?

531
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:25,388
- Coming third in my first race.
- But I told you you weren't ready.

532
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:28,125
Which you just proved
by making that reckless overtake.

533
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,250
That overtake got me through to States.

534
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:31,958
Yeah. It could have put you in a coffin.

535
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:33,083
But it didn't.

536
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:34,666
You should congratulate me.

537
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:36,708
Where did this come from?

538
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,250
The back of your shed.

539
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:43,083
Not bad work.

540
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:44,625
Did you do it?

541
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:47,750
I had a lot of help from my mates.

542
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:51,541
And I... I need help from you too.

543
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,083
Will you be my coach?

544
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:57,375
When I say coach,

545
00:36:57,458 --> 00:37:00,625
I mean teach me everything
I need to know about driving.

546
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:03,916
I don't wanna be doing
any more of this spraying

547
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,291
or painting or cleaning with my feet.

548
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:08,875
All of that was to improve your fitness.
All right?

549
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:11,798
The spraying develops your arms,
so they don't get tired when you steer.

550
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:15,375
The painting strengthens your neck, so you
can handle the G-forces when you corner.

551
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:17,298
The cleaning improves
your ankles' flexibility,

552
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:18,693
so you can work the pedals faster.

553
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,083
See?

554
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:23,625
This is exactly
why I need you to be my coach.

555
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:31,125
- Are you thinking again?
- Yes.

556
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:37,875
All right, listen to me.

557
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:43,541
I will coach you,
but you are gonna do everything I say.

558
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:44,875
Do you understand?

559
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,083
No backchat.

560
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,791
Okay. No backchat.

561
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:53,208
Nice suit, by the way.

562
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:05,458
Oh, those corn are great, by the way.
You're gonna love it.

563
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:07,875
- Thanks, guys. See ya.
- Thank you.

564
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:29,375
Mmm.

565
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:33,708
Mmm.

566
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:40,541
No, no, no, no, no.

567
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:42,625
Hi, Barry!

568
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:44,458
He did not.

569
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:46,750
Not on my watch.

570
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:00,416
Jack...

571
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:04,666
I'm gonna get you to pull over
and, uh, turn off your ignition, please.

572
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:09,833
<i>Your mother is going to be
very disappointed.</i>

573
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:12,125
<i>Jack?</i>

574
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:16,291
Hello?

575
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:18,866
<i>Is this thing working?</i>

576
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:23,625
<i>I'm ordering you to stop the vehicle.</i>

577
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:26,166
<i>Please. Thank you.</i>

578
00:39:40,416 --> 00:39:42,750
What on earth do you think
you're doing, mate?

579
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:44,208
I need you

580
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:46,250
to ask my mother out on a date.

581
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:48,833
What?

582
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:53,583
- And why would I want to do that?
- Because you like her.

583
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:56,333
Excuse me? I don't...

584
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,875
This... You...

585
00:39:58,791 --> 00:39:59,791
You...

586
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:02,958
I hope your conversation skills
are better than this on the date.

587
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:06,250
There isn't gonna be any date, mate.

588
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:08,458
- Why not?
- What makes you even think I like her?

589
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:10,250
Well, you haven't arrested me.

590
00:40:10,791 --> 00:40:12,041
The night is young.

591
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:13,875
Ha! See? There it is.

592
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:16,208
That's the type of cheeky banter
my mother loves.

593
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,708
Why are you asking me to do this?

594
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,500
You're a cop,
so you're probably not a criminal.

595
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:25,791
And you're not wearing a wedding ring.
You are single, right?

596
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,875
- Yes.
- Good.

597
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:30,291
And I'm guessing
your dad's out of the picture.

598
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:31,375
Yeah.

599
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:34,625
So, uh, what do you reckon?

600
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:36,666
The thing is...

601
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:41,041
when I talk to women socially,

602
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:43,916
I have been known to freeze up
from time to time.

603
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Okay.

604
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:48,750
- Make that all of the time.
- Okay, well...

605
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:51,000
that ends today, Barry.

606
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:53,625
She's inside.

607
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:56,625
Take a moment
to come up with an opening line.

608
00:40:57,125 --> 00:40:58,125
All right.

609
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,458
Okay.

610
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:02,958
- Got it.
- Good.

611
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:04,541
Try it on me. Go.

612
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:07,145
Hey, Christie.

613
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:09,833
Would you like
to go out to dinner with me?

614
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:11,666
Next week, perhaps?

615
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:14,916
Why do you have an accent all of a sudden?

616
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,416
- I don't have an accent.
- You do!

617
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,291
Okay, let's try it again.
One more time, yeah?

618
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:20,375
Okay. All right.

619
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:22,583
Hey, Christie.

620
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,500
Would you like
to go out to dinner with me sometime?

621
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:26,666
Sometime next week?

622
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:29,416
That was pretty good.

623
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,333
- It was adequate.
- That was all right.

624
00:41:31,416 --> 00:41:32,416
All right. Come on.

625
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,833
Okay.

626
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Good luck.

627
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,166
Ahem.

628
00:41:44,916 --> 00:41:46,458
- Officer Johansen.
- Hey.

629
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:48,083
Uh, is everything okay?

630
00:41:49,916 --> 00:41:51,291
Everything's cool-magool.

631
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:56,833
Yeah.

632
00:41:58,041 --> 00:41:59,041
Um...

633
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,583
Can I help you with anything?

634
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,250
Yes.

635
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:04,458
Christie, I was, um...

636
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:09,416
Christie, I was wondering if you'd, uh...

637
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:14,166
like to go out to dinner with me
sometime... next week.

638
00:42:15,416 --> 00:42:16,416
Perhaps.

639
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:21,583
Yeah. That'd be lovely.

640
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,416
- Really?
- Yeah.

641
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:27,625
That's great!

642
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:29,375
That's great.

643
00:42:29,666 --> 00:42:30,666
Um...

644
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:32,125
I'll be in touch.

645
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:33,833
Oh, okay.

646
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:36,500
There we are.

647
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:37,958
Uh...

648
00:42:38,041 --> 00:42:39,041
Bye.

649
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,416
So, Regionals went well.

650
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,666
Didn't need to make those changes
to the kart after all.

651
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:54,833
I guess.

652
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:57,125
"I guess"?

653
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,910
What's that supposed to mean?

654
00:43:00,541 --> 00:43:02,083
The kart was fast. I won.

655
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:04,166
Your changes weren't necessary.

656
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,291
I'm just being honest.

657
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:09,208
Don't take it personally.

658
00:43:11,916 --> 00:43:14,500
If your kart was fast,
you would have pulled away.

659
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:16,708
But you won by half a length.

660
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,458
If you started anywhere but the front,
you would have lost.

661
00:43:22,708 --> 00:43:23,875
I'm just being honest.

662
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:25,875
Don't take it personally.

663
00:43:32,916 --> 00:43:33,916
Hey.

664
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,500
Hi.

665
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:42,000
I've been asked out on a date.

666
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,791
- Really?
- Yeah.

667
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:45,375
That's cool.

668
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,958
I don't know what you did, but...

669
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:51,458
thank you.

670
00:43:51,541 --> 00:43:54,000
I'm sure I have no idea
what you're talking about.

671
00:43:58,416 --> 00:44:00,833
You know you don't have to fix everything,
right?

672
00:44:01,416 --> 00:44:03,541
You don't always have to be
the strong one.

673
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,375
It's okay if you want to, you know...

674
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:09,000
show some emotion.

675
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:12,833
That one.

676
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:21,291
Hey, Barry.

677
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:27,458
Welcome to race school.

678
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:29,375
What's that for?

679
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,833
Backchat.
It will also be used as a teaching aid.

680
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:35,601
It's really quite loud.

681
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Now get in.

682
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:42,125
Sorry.

683
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:43,541
Act like I'm not here.

684
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:48,125
Place your hands on the wheel.

685
00:44:51,708 --> 00:44:52,791
Wrong.

686
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:56,416
The correct position is nine o'clock
and three o'clock.

687
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:05,000
It doesn't feel natural...

688
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,809
You'll always know
which way your front wheels are pointing

689
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:10,166
if your hands mirror their position
on the steering wheel.

690
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:11,875
Easy breezy.

691
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:13,666
Easy breezy.

692
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:26,333
When the wheel's turned,
a string will be tied on the accelerator.

693
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:28,416
You won't be able to press it
without snapping it.

694
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,625
But as the wheel straightens...

695
00:45:31,333 --> 00:45:32,958
it'll start to give you some slack.

696
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:34,958
You can floor it.

697
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:37,041
Ugh!

698
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:39,166
I want you to drive as fast as you can.

699
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:41,791
But you don't snap the string.

700
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:44,833
You keep your hands at nine and three
at all times.

701
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,833
Aah!

702
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:49,541
Whoa.

703
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:51,583
I'm all right.

704
00:45:56,916 --> 00:45:58,125
Easy into the corner.

705
00:46:01,916 --> 00:46:03,583
Nine and three!

706
00:46:05,708 --> 00:46:06,875
Wait till we exit.

707
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,500
Nine and three.

708
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,000
Too soon.

709
00:46:14,916 --> 00:46:17,476
You've got to find
that balance between the accelerator

710
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,500
and the steering wheel.

711
00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:20,125
Yes?

712
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:23,333
Nine and three!

713
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:26,833
Keep the balance.

714
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:31,500
Not so easy breezy now, is it? Huh?

715
00:46:50,166 --> 00:46:51,458
All right, that'll do.

716
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:55,125
Right.

717
00:46:55,375 --> 00:46:56,541
Same time tomorrow.

718
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:00,500
Hey. What if the race line is blocked?

719
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:03,083
I mean, how do I get past?

720
00:47:04,541 --> 00:47:07,166
Well, each situation's different,
so there's no right answer.

721
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:11,625
But I like to apply
the rules of the overtake.

722
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:14,041
Be patient,

723
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,625
analyze what each driver is doing,

724
00:47:17,708 --> 00:47:20,000
and take advantage of any mistake.

725
00:47:22,666 --> 00:47:23,791
What's going on?

726
00:47:24,916 --> 00:47:26,041
I wasn't very good today.

727
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:31,101
Feeling sorry for yourself
isn't gonna make you a better driver,

728
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:33,125
it's just gonna make you
annoying to be around.

729
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:34,916
Yeah, but it pisses me off.

730
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:35,833
Good.

731
00:47:35,916 --> 00:47:36,916
Use it.

732
00:47:39,125 --> 00:47:39,958
Hey.

733
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:41,208
When I googled you,

734
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:44,166
it said that you retired from racing
in the middle of the season.

735
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:48,791
Hey, Mandy.

736
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:50,833
She never says hi to us.

737
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:00,791
Accelerate out of the apex.

738
00:48:06,958 --> 00:48:09,458
Remember your balance here.
Take a tighter line.

739
00:48:34,708 --> 00:48:36,083
Okay, pull it up here.

740
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,166
How was that?

741
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:47,000
Oh, my God. A smile!

742
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:49,388
That's the first time
I've seen your teeth.

743
00:48:49,416 --> 00:48:50,750
All right, don't get cocky.

744
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:53,083
You've got a long road ahead of you.

745
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:57,875
You've got to prepare your kart for State.
Your friends are gonna help again?

746
00:48:57,958 --> 00:48:58,958
I'm in!

747
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,875
Is he the one who made it quick?

748
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:06,125
He just found out
the engine runs on petrol.

749
00:49:06,916 --> 00:49:08,625
We need the one who made it quick.

750
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:24,083
Hey, Mandy?

751
00:49:24,666 --> 00:49:25,666
What?

752
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:27,708
Are you serious?

753
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:28,833
You did it again.

754
00:49:28,916 --> 00:49:30,166
You really couldn't see me?

755
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:33,208
We've been over this. They're shadows.

756
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:35,083
What are you doing here?

757
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:37,000
I wanted to thank you.

758
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:40,371
I wouldn't have made it through to State
without you.

759
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:42,750
I know.

760
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:44,291
Can you make it quicker?

761
00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:47,541
I don't know if I want to.

762
00:49:48,291 --> 00:49:51,166
- Why?
- Because you didn't listen to me.

763
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,170
I told you not to go
on the outside of the track,

764
00:49:53,208 --> 00:49:54,583
and that's exactly what you did.

765
00:49:54,666 --> 00:49:56,208
The inside was blocked.

766
00:49:56,291 --> 00:49:58,416
The inside is always blocked.

767
00:49:58,916 --> 00:50:01,000
The trick is to find a way to unblock it.

768
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:02,958
See?

769
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:05,583
I need to know this stuff.

770
00:50:07,625 --> 00:50:09,585
You only say that
because you want me to help you.

771
00:50:09,625 --> 00:50:10,625
Absolutely.

772
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:12,916
That doesn't mean it's not true.

773
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:15,458
Will you do it?

774
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,250
I don't know.

775
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:24,333
I'll take that as a definite maybe.

776
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:35,041
Is this all your handiwork, Jack?

777
00:50:35,791 --> 00:50:36,791
That's pretty good.

778
00:50:38,625 --> 00:50:39,750
I thank you.

779
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:42,916
You're working with Mike Zeta's daughter?

780
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:47,166
Yeah, and he can't find out
I'm doing this.

781
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:49,208
This is not gonna happen.

782
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:51,750
All in favor
of Mandy being chief engineer?

783
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,500
Carried.

784
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:03,750
You said you wanted
the one who made it quick.

785
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:15,875
Hey, I, um...

786
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:18,625
I really appreciate you helping me out.

787
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,541
No worries.

788
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:22,458
I want to say thank you by...

789
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:23,958
uh...

790
00:51:24,041 --> 00:51:25,083
asking you out.

791
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:28,291
That'd be lovely.

792
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:35,416
Right, well...

793
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:37,708
This is awkward.

794
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:39,250
Yep.

795
00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:41,208
I'll go see if Patrick
needs anything.

796
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:42,875
Anyway...

797
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,875
I thought it'd be cool to see
what you guys do for fun-ness around here.

798
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:52,791
Does that smile mean yes?

799
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:57,541
It means...

800
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:01,166
I'll meet you at the Rollerdrome
tomorrow at six.

801
00:52:05,166 --> 00:52:06,166
Cool.

802
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,833
Yeah.

803
00:52:08,916 --> 00:52:10,500
Patrick?

804
00:52:11,958 --> 00:52:13,750
Hello? I'm off.

805
00:52:38,166 --> 00:52:39,625
Oh, cool.

806
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:53,875
What the hell are you doing?

807
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:55,208
Uh... um...

808
00:52:55,875 --> 00:52:57,583
I had to drop off your keys.

809
00:52:58,583 --> 00:53:02,625
Right, and somehow break
a $150 Thomastik-Infeld D string.

810
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:03,708
I'm sorry.

811
00:53:04,291 --> 00:53:05,291
Get out.

812
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:09,083
Whoa!

813
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:11,250
That's so cool.

814
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:12,708
Get out!

815
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:14,625
Okay.

816
00:53:16,208 --> 00:53:17,500
Oh, my God!

817
00:53:19,541 --> 00:53:20,541
You're so young.

818
00:53:21,291 --> 00:53:22,291
Who's your mate?

819
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:24,750
Nobody.

820
00:53:25,208 --> 00:53:26,041
Out.

821
00:53:57,416 --> 00:53:58,416
G'day, Barry.

822
00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:00,666
Everything okay?

823
00:54:01,416 --> 00:54:02,583
Yeah, of course.

824
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,958
Uh, no, not really.

825
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:11,000
Thing is, I've got a date
with your mother tonight.

826
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:12,250
- Yeah?
- And...

827
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,208
I've come to realize
that I don't know what she likes.

828
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:17,375
So I need some advice.

829
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:19,541
For example...

830
00:54:20,125 --> 00:54:21,541
what does she actually like?

831
00:54:22,541 --> 00:54:23,541
Uh...

832
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:27,541
The music of Daryl Braithwaite.

833
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:28,833
Just give me a second, mate.

834
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,500
Braithwaite.

835
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:34,041
Yeah.

836
00:54:34,416 --> 00:54:35,416
Um...

837
00:54:36,958 --> 00:54:38,208
Chinese food.

838
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:39,708
Chinese.

839
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:41,500
And, um...

840
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:45,333
Steve Carell movies?

841
00:54:45,416 --> 00:54:47,208
I really did like <i>40-Year-Old Virgin.</i>

842
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,916
I'm just...

843
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,840
I'm afraid she's gonna think
I'm really boring.

844
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:53,875
Then don't be.

845
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:58,750
Look, don't talk about yourself too much.
Ask questions.

846
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:00,875
Listen to the answers.

847
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:03,208
- Listen.
- Make jokes.

848
00:55:03,291 --> 00:55:05,291
- Jokes.
- Have fun.

849
00:55:06,166 --> 00:55:07,166
- Fun.
- Yeah.

850
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
That's gold.

851
00:55:09,541 --> 00:55:11,666
- Where'd you get all this stuff?
- My dad.

852
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,083
Well, he was a very wise man.

853
00:55:16,166 --> 00:55:17,083
Catch you later.

854
00:55:40,708 --> 00:55:41,708
Wow.

855
00:55:43,041 --> 00:55:44,291
You look so lovely and...

856
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:46,458
clean.

857
00:55:48,416 --> 00:55:50,583
Did you say, "Lovely and clean"?

858
00:55:52,458 --> 00:55:54,750
I mean, most of the time,
you're covered in grease.

859
00:55:54,833 --> 00:55:56,375
You should stop talking now.

860
00:55:56,458 --> 00:55:58,041
Yeah. Yeah.

861
00:55:58,125 --> 00:55:59,125
Coming up!

862
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,791
Well, we tried.

863
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:13,375
I've got an idea.

864
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:21,708
Humongous Claw!

865
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,458
You didn't have an idea.

866
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:27,833
You just looked around,
saw the Humongous Claw,

867
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:29,916
and shouted, "The Humongous Claw!"

868
00:56:31,375 --> 00:56:32,375
Absolutely.

869
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:35,958
That doesn't mean it's not fun.

870
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:37,583
Hey? I mean...

871
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:39,625
it's a claw that's humongous.

872
00:56:42,708 --> 00:56:43,708
Please give it a go.

873
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:46,625
Please.

874
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,875
Hey, do you wanna go and see
the new Steve Carell movie tonight?

875
00:56:56,958 --> 00:56:57,833
That'd be great.

876
00:56:57,916 --> 00:57:00,291
It's playing up
at the Orana Cinema.

877
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,375
Okay.

878
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:02,875
Then maybe...

879
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:05,333
if you wanted to,
we could go to the Jade Temple.

880
00:57:06,375 --> 00:57:07,541
Get some Chinese food.

881
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:09,791
Oh, yeah, I love Chinese.

882
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:10,875
Yeah.

883
00:57:12,666 --> 00:57:17,416
♪ <i>One summer I'll find a way ♪</i>

884
00:57:18,666 --> 00:57:21,166
♪ <i>One summer I will... ♪</i>

885
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:22,916
Are you singing a Daryl Braithwaite song?

886
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,541
Yeah.

887
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:26,625
I love Daryl.

888
00:57:27,166 --> 00:57:28,416
I'm a massive fan.

889
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,791
- Really?
- Yeah.

890
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:31,416
You like Daryl Braithwaite?

891
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:32,750
Yeah.

892
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:36,125
No.

893
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:37,500
Not really.

894
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:41,375
I've never heard of him.
Actually, that's not true.

895
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:43,791
I committed it to memory.

896
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:44,958
Oh, my God!

897
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:46,916
- Why would you do that?
- I don't know.

898
00:57:47,541 --> 00:57:50,250
Someone told me that you liked him,
so I thought I'd impress you.

899
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:53,291
Look, why don't we do something
that we'd both like to do?

900
00:57:53,375 --> 00:57:56,875
So no Steve Carell, no Daryl Braithwaite,
no Chinese restaurant,

901
00:57:56,958 --> 00:57:59,333
no whatever else
my son said that I'd like.

902
00:58:00,416 --> 00:58:01,666
Good thinking. Rightie-o.

903
00:58:02,458 --> 00:58:05,000
Although I'd still like Chinese food.
Do you want to do that?

904
00:58:05,083 --> 00:58:06,958
Oh, good. Yeah, I'm dying for a dim sim.

905
00:58:10,416 --> 00:58:13,583
If you finish in the top three
and you make it through to Nationals,

906
00:58:13,666 --> 00:58:16,375
it's my first step
towards becoming the next Leena Gade.

907
00:58:16,458 --> 00:58:17,541
Next who?

908
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:20,125
She's the first woman
to engineer a car that won Le Mans.

909
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:22,666
I want to be her but in Formula 1.

910
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:23,583
Cool.

911
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,458
Well, we'd better win then, hey?

912
00:58:25,541 --> 00:58:26,541
No pressure.

913
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:30,541
My dad and I used to come here
when I was little.

914
00:58:31,416 --> 00:58:32,750
We haven't been for a while.

915
00:58:33,625 --> 00:58:34,625
What's your dad like?

916
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Uh...

917
00:58:37,875 --> 00:58:39,208
He died when I was 11.

918
00:58:40,708 --> 00:58:41,708
Cancer.

919
00:58:43,416 --> 00:58:46,333
Oh, man. And here I am blabbering on.

920
00:58:47,416 --> 00:58:48,416
It's fine.

921
00:58:50,333 --> 00:58:51,541
What was he like?

922
00:58:51,625 --> 00:58:53,125
Oh, he loved cars.

923
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:56,541
We used to drive around
on the weekends in his old car.

924
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I really miss that.

925
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,416
I'm sorry. This was supposed to be fun.

926
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:13,416
Actually, this is the most fun-ness
I've had in a long time.

927
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:40,875
You know, R2-D2 speaks perfect English
in the <i>Star Wars </i>movies,

928
00:59:40,958 --> 00:59:42,291
but all we hear are the beeps,

929
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:44,875
because he loves
to drop the f-bomb so much.

930
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:51,875
- Oh, no.
- It's ruined.

931
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:53,500
Who'd do this?

932
00:59:57,583 --> 00:59:58,583
Them.

933
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:15,375
That's my brother and his ass clown mates.

934
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:22,958
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

935
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:25,041
I can fix it.

936
01:00:26,666 --> 01:00:27,666
I don't know.

937
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,125
We can do it.

938
01:00:29,541 --> 01:00:31,416
State Championships are tomorrow.

939
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:35,541
So? We work all night
and hit Dean where it hurts. On the track.

940
01:00:36,041 --> 01:00:38,500
Personally,
I'd rather hit him in the nuts, but...

941
01:00:39,041 --> 01:00:40,208
on the track works too.

942
01:00:41,458 --> 01:00:43,166
Okay. Let's get to it.

943
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:06,125
We need a new brake disc.
This one is toast.

944
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:08,291
So we're screwed?

945
01:01:12,208 --> 01:01:13,541
Not necessarily.

946
01:01:17,041 --> 01:01:18,521
My dad won't give me anything

947
01:01:18,583 --> 01:01:20,541
if he finds out I'm working
with a rival team.

948
01:01:20,666 --> 01:01:22,166
It's our only option.

949
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,958
Look, I'm sure you'll do great in prison,

950
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:28,250
but my delicate constitution
isn't suited to a life behind bars.

951
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:30,416
No one's going to prison, Colin.

952
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,291
We're just gonna fix what they destroyed.

953
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:35,458
Now, keep your balaclavas on.
There's cameras everywhere.

954
01:01:36,041 --> 01:01:37,333
Okay, you're on watch.

955
01:01:37,416 --> 01:01:40,000
So if anyone approaches the building,
you have to let us know.

956
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:43,625
All right. If I see anyone coming,
I'll make a bird sound like...

957
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,458
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

958
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:47,791
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

959
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:49,750
Okay. Let's go on three.

960
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:52,708
- One, two...
- We're up to two already?

961
01:01:52,916 --> 01:01:53,916
Three!

962
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:57,291
Okay. This isn't so bad.

963
01:02:12,916 --> 01:02:14,041
All right, Colin.

964
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:15,208
You got this.

965
01:02:15,291 --> 01:02:17,166
I'll bet you're last!

966
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:19,250
Here comes the ankle tap! Oh!

967
01:02:20,125 --> 01:02:21,250
Stupid joke, Dean.

968
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:22,813
- Don't be such a baby.
- Jeez.

969
01:02:23,625 --> 01:02:24,625
Got it!

970
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:25,583
Excellent.

971
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:27,767
- Dean, tell us the code.
- You're dreaming.

972
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:30,458
Caw! Caw!

973
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:31,541
Ca-caw!

974
01:02:31,583 --> 01:02:32,833
Ca-caw!

975
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,060
Quick, quick, quick! Down here!

976
01:02:40,583 --> 01:02:42,383
Fire up the PlayStation.
I'll get some drinks.

977
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:45,333
- Shotgun player one!
- You're always player one. It's my turn.

978
01:02:45,416 --> 01:02:47,458
I'm player one. I'm the best.

979
01:02:47,541 --> 01:02:49,458
Hey, Dean. Get me a lemonade.

980
01:02:49,958 --> 01:02:51,500
What's with that stupid bird?

981
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:54,125
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

982
01:02:58,333 --> 01:03:00,916
Ralph, three. Ted, nothing.
You ain't gonna stop me.

983
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,880
- 'Cause I'm the best!
- Coming right up.

984
01:03:08,208 --> 01:03:10,166
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

985
01:03:16,291 --> 01:03:17,291
What was that?

986
01:03:17,625 --> 01:03:18,625
Who's there?

987
01:03:21,458 --> 01:03:22,791
I've never felt so alive!

988
01:03:27,166 --> 01:03:28,375
We stole a brake disc!

989
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:34,875
You stole my heart.

990
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:38,291
That's the lamest thing you've ever said.

991
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:40,916
And the best.

992
01:03:49,375 --> 01:03:51,250
It's amazing you don't get heartburn.

993
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:55,416
Sorry I can't come today.

994
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,375
Ah, it's all right.
I'll just get Colin to FaceTime you.

995
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:01,000
I like to call it FT.

996
01:04:03,416 --> 01:04:04,416
Okay, yeah.

997
01:04:04,958 --> 01:04:06,666
- I've got to go, Mum.
- Okay.

998
01:04:07,666 --> 01:04:09,083
- Wish me luck.
- Luck.

999
01:04:09,166 --> 01:04:10,166
See you soon.

1000
01:04:10,458 --> 01:04:12,658
- Don't do that scary sliding thing.
- Don't worry, Mum.

1001
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:24,631
<i>You're clearly favorite
to take the Under-16 State Championship.</i>

1002
01:04:24,958 --> 01:04:26,625
<i>Are you confident of a win?</i>

1003
01:04:26,708 --> 01:04:28,948
<i>Yes, well, of course
I would love to win State this year.</i>

1004
01:04:30,041 --> 01:04:33,166
<i>But, at this point in time,
I'm just taking it one day after the next.</i>

1005
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:34,500
Let me give you a tip.

1006
01:04:35,375 --> 01:04:37,541
Everybody takes it one day after the next.

1007
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,416
That's how time works.

1008
01:04:44,375 --> 01:04:45,750
See you at the finish line.

1009
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:47,458
I'll be waiting for you.

1010
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:53,083
Out of the way.

1011
01:04:56,416 --> 01:04:58,291
Mate, you've got to stand up to him, okay?

1012
01:04:59,291 --> 01:05:00,333
Show no fear.

1013
01:05:04,416 --> 01:05:06,875
Hi. I'm here to register
for the Under-16s.

1014
01:05:07,791 --> 01:05:09,875
The KA3 qualifying session ends

1015
01:05:09,958 --> 01:05:12,500
and title favorite Dean Zeta
is in first place.

1016
01:05:12,583 --> 01:05:13,583
<i>In second it's...</i>

1017
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:15,625
Aw, man. 14th?

1018
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:17,208
That sucks.

1019
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Don't worry.

1020
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:21,250
I mean, look at these.

1021
01:05:21,958 --> 01:05:24,083
You're gonna be a lot faster
with some new tires on.

1022
01:05:24,625 --> 01:05:25,833
I can't afford new ones.

1023
01:05:26,666 --> 01:05:28,586
It's a good thing I brought a set then,
isn't it?

1024
01:05:30,416 --> 01:05:31,416
Oh, man.

1025
01:05:32,583 --> 01:05:33,666
Thanks.

1026
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:35,590
- Really, thank you. This...
- Yeah, all right.

1027
01:05:36,125 --> 01:05:37,291
Just focus on the race.

1028
01:05:37,875 --> 01:05:39,375
Remember the rules of the overtake.

1029
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Be patient.

1030
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,458
Analyze what the other drivers are doing.

1031
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:45,333
Take advantage of any mistake.

1032
01:05:45,958 --> 01:05:47,278
And dance like nobody's watching.

1033
01:05:48,291 --> 01:05:49,625
There's no dancing.

1034
01:05:50,416 --> 01:05:52,125
But yeah. Good.

1035
01:05:52,208 --> 01:05:53,208
Okay.

1036
01:05:56,666 --> 01:05:57,666
What?

1037
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,458
Aren't you gonna give me
a motivational speech?

1038
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:01,958
Didn't I just do that?

1039
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:07,666
I mean something rousingly inspirational
about never giving up,

1040
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:10,583
and doing your best,
and the eye of the tiger and all that?

1041
01:06:11,916 --> 01:06:12,916
Oh, yeah.

1042
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:16,708
I mean, I could do all that.
It would feel a bit forced now.

1043
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:19,166
I mean, that stuff's
got to be spontaneous.

1044
01:06:19,958 --> 01:06:24,125
I attack until I lead.
I take no prisoners. I never concede.

1045
01:06:24,208 --> 01:06:27,458
Whoever said winning isn't everything
is a fool who knows nothing.

1046
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,208
I am unbeatable.

1047
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:49,500
<i>And they're racing!</i>

1048
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:55,500
<i>Okay, kart racers,</i>

1049
01:06:55,583 --> 01:06:57,291
let's see how fast you really are.

1050
01:06:57,375 --> 01:06:58,666
After 20 laps of racing,

1051
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:01,625
the top three finishers will advance
to the National finals.

1052
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:04,583
<i>Dean Zeta leads with daylight second.</i>

1053
01:07:17,916 --> 01:07:21,500
<i>They're traveling at 100 km an hour
a few millimeters above the ground.</i>

1054
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:27,041
<i>You make your own luck in a kart.</i>

1055
01:07:28,541 --> 01:07:30,791
<i>And Jack Hooper slices through the field.</i>

1056
01:07:46,583 --> 01:07:49,375
<i>Jack Hooper has a monster lunge
down the back straight</i>

1057
01:07:49,458 --> 01:07:51,041
<i>and picks up three places!</i>

1058
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:10,916
<i>Storming performance
from the new boy from Busselton.</i>

1059
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,833
He's hugging the inside of the track
like it's his favorite granny.

1060
01:08:25,166 --> 01:08:27,125
Remember the rules of the overtake.

1061
01:08:28,541 --> 01:08:29,541
Be patient.

1062
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:33,875
Analyze what the other drivers are doing.

1063
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:37,666
Take advantage of any mistake.

1064
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:46,375
<i>Hooper picks up another place.</i>

1065
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:56,033
The top three can cruise home from here,
and they'll be through to the Nationals.

1066
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:03,000
<i>Hooper throws one up the inside
and steals it.</i>

1067
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:05,856
I'm coming for you, dude man.

1068
01:09:05,916 --> 01:09:10,166
<i>A beautifully-constructed pass,
but also completely unnecessary.</i>

1069
01:09:15,708 --> 01:09:18,208
<i>Hooper didn't get the memo
about holding positions.</i>

1070
01:09:18,291 --> 01:09:19,583
<i>He's here to race.</i>

1071
01:09:22,041 --> 01:09:23,625
<i>Hooper tries to dive for first.</i>

1072
01:09:31,916 --> 01:09:33,125
Come on!

1073
01:09:33,208 --> 01:09:34,541
He muscles Jack Hooper wide.

1074
01:09:34,625 --> 01:09:36,000
<i>We're on the final lap.</i>

1075
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Come on, Jack!

1076
01:09:41,625 --> 01:09:42,708
Come on, move!

1077
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:46,309
- <i>Show no fear.
- Don't go on the outside.</i>

1078
01:09:46,333 --> 01:09:47,973
- <i>Be patient.</i>
- I am unbeatable.

1079
01:09:54,833 --> 01:09:56,416
<i>He loses it!</i>

1080
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:57,500
<i>Oh, no!</i>

1081
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,559
<i>I told you you weren't ready.</i>

1082
01:10:01,583 --> 01:10:03,423
<i>Get on the marbles,
you will slide off.</i>

1083
01:11:10,416 --> 01:11:12,736
<i>...they qualify
for the National Championships.</i>

1084
01:11:13,625 --> 01:11:16,875
<i>Jack Hooper finished fourth
and backwards over the finishing line.</i>

1085
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,875
You were second
and we were on our way to Nationals,

1086
01:11:20,958 --> 01:11:22,291
and instead you threw it away

1087
01:11:22,375 --> 01:11:25,041
by making a reckless move
that wasted all our time and effort.

1088
01:11:27,041 --> 01:11:28,166
Why would you do that?

1089
01:11:28,708 --> 01:11:29,708
I don't know.

1090
01:11:30,875 --> 01:11:31,958
I just had to beat him.

1091
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:33,333
But you didn't.

1092
01:11:33,416 --> 01:11:36,625
And you didn't even qualify,
so you could beat him when it counted.

1093
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,833
You put yourself ahead of the team,

1094
01:11:39,916 --> 01:11:42,041
and I can't be with someone who does that.

1095
01:11:46,083 --> 01:11:47,708
Not enough talent, hey, Patrick?

1096
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:51,166
Looks like you backed
the wrong horse, mate.

1097
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:54,916
Come on. Help us load this in.

1098
01:11:57,125 --> 01:11:59,541
Come on. We're doing this for you.
Chop chop.

1099
01:12:02,333 --> 01:12:03,333
What?

1100
01:12:04,458 --> 01:12:05,458
Well...

1101
01:12:05,791 --> 01:12:06,791
if it wasn't for me...

1102
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:09,416
you'd still be in that caravan
hiding from the world,

1103
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,125
like a sad old man.

1104
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:21,666
You know, that was a bit harsh.

1105
01:12:22,958 --> 01:12:24,041
Shut up, Colin.

1106
01:12:24,625 --> 01:12:25,625
What would you know?

1107
01:12:32,708 --> 01:12:34,583
Hey. Are you okay?

1108
01:12:35,375 --> 01:12:37,351
- I saw the accident.
- Don't want to talk about it.

1109
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,101
- Well, I do.
- Don't want to talk about it, Mum.

1110
01:12:39,125 --> 01:12:42,125
- I don't think you should race anymore.
- You don't have to worry about it!

1111
01:12:42,666 --> 01:12:44,583
I didn't make it through to Nationals!

1112
01:12:45,083 --> 01:12:46,083
It's over!

1113
01:13:03,916 --> 01:13:04,916
Yes!

1114
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:06,833
Go! Yes!

1115
01:13:08,416 --> 01:13:09,791
Finally.

1116
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:23,333

1117
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:34,750

Jack, you've got to talk to me.

01:15:59,791 --> 01:16:01,333
Why do you keep doing this?

1142
01:16:07,083 --> 01:16:08,083
It was our thing.

1143
01:16:09,416 --> 01:16:11,375
What? What was?

1144
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Donuts.

1145
01:16:19,625 --> 01:16:21,833
Me and Dad used to do them
when we drove around.

1146
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:26,750
Sometimes, I just...

1147
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:30,083
miss him so much.

1148
01:16:32,541 --> 01:16:35,041
So I take your car out
and for a little while, I just...

1149
01:16:36,833 --> 01:16:37,833
it's like he's...

1150
01:16:38,166 --> 01:16:39,166
with me again.

1151
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:43,416
And I don't know how to fix it.

1152
01:16:44,291 --> 01:16:45,291
Fix what?

1153
01:16:47,916 --> 01:16:49,000
The way I feel.

1154
01:16:50,625 --> 01:16:52,000
Our lives without him.

1155
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,708
Some things you just can't fix.

1156
01:16:58,041 --> 01:17:00,041
But this pain that you feel...

1157
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:02,083
it'll fade.

1158
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:05,833
I don't want it to.

1159
01:17:07,916 --> 01:17:10,125
I mean, it's already happening,
and I don't want it to.

1160
01:17:13,583 --> 01:17:14,666
I don't want to forget him.

1161
01:17:15,791 --> 01:17:17,458
Oh, we won't let that happen.

1162
01:17:22,791 --> 01:17:23,791
I'm crying.

1163
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:25,666
Just let it out. You'll feel better.

1164
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:28,291
Yeah, well, Dad said
blokes only get three cries in life.

1165
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:29,416
Well, he was wrong.

1166
01:17:30,625 --> 01:17:32,583
And if I have to choose between this

1167
01:17:32,666 --> 01:17:33,986
and you keeping everything inside

1168
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:36,500
until you lose it
and steal my car again...

1169
01:17:37,458 --> 01:17:38,708
I choose this.

1170
01:17:40,833 --> 01:17:41,833
Yeah.

1171
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:07,250
Oi, Colin!

1172
01:18:10,958 --> 01:18:11,958
Colin?

1173
01:18:20,875 --> 01:18:21,875
Colin!

1174
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Mate, I know you're there.
I can see your curtains twitching.

1175
01:18:33,916 --> 01:18:35,125
I want to apologize.

1176
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:40,875
Okay. Fair enough.

1177
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:42,875
I'm sorry.

1178
01:18:43,541 --> 01:18:46,958
I know what I said was terrible,
and I'm an idiot.

1179
01:18:48,875 --> 01:18:50,750
And I don't deserve you as my bestie.

1180
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:07,916
- Hm.
- What is it?

1181
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:11,250
The driver who came second at State
had an illegal carburetor.

1182
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:14,333
He's been disqualified.

1183
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:17,125
And I've been promoted to third.

1184
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:18,708
Oh.

1185
01:19:19,708 --> 01:19:21,125
And I can race at Nationals.

1186
01:19:23,375 --> 01:19:24,375
Doesn't matter.

1187
01:19:24,916 --> 01:19:26,000
Kart's wrecked.

1188
01:19:26,708 --> 01:19:28,541
I managed to piss off everyone on my team,

1189
01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:30,708
and you don't want me to do it anyway.

1190
01:19:33,833 --> 01:19:35,750
Well, if it's something
that you really love...

1191
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,125
I guess I'll just have to be brave.

1192
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:40,041
Thanks.

1193
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:41,791
Just get your team back together.

1194
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:45,750
I don't know, Mum.

1195
01:19:46,583 --> 01:19:47,791
I mean, I was terrible.

1196
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:49,666
I think they'll help.

1197
01:19:50,916 --> 01:19:54,041
You know,
girls kind of like it when you apologize.

1198
01:19:54,666 --> 01:19:55,666
Yeah.

1199
01:20:11,708 --> 01:20:13,625
Heard you lucked through to Nationals.

1200
01:20:14,375 --> 01:20:16,583
And that means
you're gonna need to fix your kart.

1201
01:20:17,916 --> 01:20:20,291
And I'm not gonna let you
steal any more of our parts.

1202
01:20:22,875 --> 01:20:25,458
You do need to be punished
for the last time you robbed us.

1203
01:20:26,666 --> 01:20:28,208
Leave my bestie alone!

1204
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:32,665
- Standing up to them. Showing no fear.
- I love it!

1205
01:20:33,125 --> 01:20:35,684
- Does it mean you accept my apology?
- Yeah, but don't do it again.

1206
01:20:35,708 --> 01:20:36,708
All right.

1207
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:38,583
Stop!

1208
01:20:41,333 --> 01:20:42,500
Settle it on the track.

1209
01:20:46,666 --> 01:20:47,833
You're dead, Hooper.

1210
01:20:53,208 --> 01:20:54,208
Mandy...

1211
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:57,708
Come on, mate. Let's go.

1212
01:21:20,541 --> 01:21:21,541
I, um...

1213
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:23,833
I shouldn't have said what I said.

1214
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:28,375
Okay, it was stupid and...

1215
01:21:29,375 --> 01:21:30,375
cruel.

1216
01:21:30,875 --> 01:21:32,958
I was upset, and I took it out on you.

1217
01:21:34,541 --> 01:21:36,416
And I hope you can forgive me.

1218
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:39,250
Well, I can,

1219
01:21:39,291 --> 01:21:41,166
because you did get me out of the caravan.

1220
01:21:43,125 --> 01:21:44,541
You want to get out one more time?

1221
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:46,333
What do you mean?

1222
01:21:47,041 --> 01:21:49,458
The driver who came second
at State was disqualified.

1223
01:21:50,333 --> 01:21:51,333
So...

1224
01:21:51,416 --> 01:21:53,333
we're going to Nationals in his place.

1225
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:54,750
Oh...

1226
01:21:54,958 --> 01:21:57,333
Listen, that accident of yours...

1227
01:21:58,291 --> 01:21:59,291
was...

1228
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:02,041
unnerving.

1229
01:22:02,541 --> 01:22:04,791
And I can't go through
something like that again.

1230
01:22:04,875 --> 01:22:06,708
Look, I'm trying to push it to the limit.

1231
01:22:06,791 --> 01:22:08,666
I'm trying to be fearless.

1232
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:10,250
You don't want to be fearless.

1233
01:22:10,833 --> 01:22:12,458
You don't want that. Fear is good.

1234
01:22:12,541 --> 01:22:14,833
Fear tells you when you push too far.

1235
01:22:14,916 --> 01:22:17,041
Doesn't it separate the winners
from everyone else?

1236
01:22:17,125 --> 01:22:17,958
No.

1237
01:22:18,041 --> 01:22:21,333
It separates the dead men
from those that get to go home.

1238
01:22:24,166 --> 01:22:26,375
It's why I was reluctant to help you
in the first place.

1239
01:22:26,458 --> 01:22:27,333
Then why did you?

1240
01:22:27,416 --> 01:22:30,708
Because, honestly,
when I saw you racing for the first time,

1241
01:22:30,791 --> 01:22:32,500
it was like I was watching myself.

1242
01:22:34,041 --> 01:22:36,958
And I thought I could help you
avoid some of the mistakes that I've made.

1243
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
What mistakes?

1244
01:22:40,458 --> 01:22:43,625
We were racing.
I was behind my teammate, and I...

1245
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:48,125
tried an overtake which was risky, stupid.

1246
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:53,375
And we clipped,
and I sent him into the wall.

1247
01:22:54,625 --> 01:22:56,041
Was it the guy in the photo?

1248
01:22:58,125 --> 01:23:01,375
Trying to be fearless on the track,
I ended up killing...

1249
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:04,750
a man who was very important to me.

1250
01:23:06,916 --> 01:23:10,125
So, honestly, I don't think
I'm the right man to be teaching you...

1251
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:11,500
You've taught me a lot.

1252
01:23:12,083 --> 01:23:13,708
Let me show you at Nationals.

1253
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:17,125
No.

1254
01:23:51,916 --> 01:23:52,916
<i>Actually...</i>

1255
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:54,458
<i>I do want this life.</i>

1256
01:23:55,041 --> 01:23:56,333
<i>But you've taught me a lot.</i>

1257
01:24:01,666 --> 01:24:03,416
<i>Let me show you at Nationals.</i>

1258
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,458
What was the first thing I ever told you?

1259
01:24:24,958 --> 01:24:26,416
The stuff about sinking the boat?

1260
01:24:27,833 --> 01:24:28,833
No, no, after that.

1261
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:30,500
Oh.

1262
01:24:30,833 --> 01:24:32,250
That you don't like backchat?

1263
01:24:33,541 --> 01:24:34,750
No, <i>before </i>that.

1264
01:24:36,791 --> 01:24:38,875
That I don't want a life in motor racing?

1265
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Yeah.

1266
01:24:43,041 --> 01:24:44,041
When I said that...

1267
01:24:44,708 --> 01:24:46,416
um, I may have been...

1268
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:50,125
talking about myself.

1269
01:24:50,875 --> 01:24:52,125
All right? But, you know...

1270
01:24:53,416 --> 01:24:54,416
things change.

1271
01:25:01,583 --> 01:25:03,625
Come on. We've got a kart to fix.

1272
01:25:06,083 --> 01:25:07,083
Chop chop.

1273
01:25:20,166 --> 01:25:22,166
This is the section
where you backed down.

1274
01:25:23,708 --> 01:25:24,708
You can't do that, son.

1275
01:25:25,666 --> 01:25:27,666
See how you've been muscled wide
by that kid?

1276
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:30,618
You need to be more aggressive
defending your position.

1277
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:43,545
<i>...come from all around the region.</i>

1278
01:25:43,583 --> 01:25:45,833
<i>Loads of talent from all the young kids.</i>

1279
01:25:45,916 --> 01:25:49,125
<i>I want to throw it to the principal
and the band master</i>

1280
01:25:49,208 --> 01:25:51,583
<i>to tell us about what sort of music
they're gonna play.</i>

1281
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:54,875
Who are you,
and what have you done with my son?

1282
01:25:54,958 --> 01:25:57,333
See? I do listen to you.

1283
01:26:00,875 --> 01:26:01,875
Okay, well...

1284
01:26:02,625 --> 01:26:03,666
I've got to bounce.

1285
01:26:04,208 --> 01:26:06,791
- Wish me luck.
- Luck. I'll see you there.

1286
01:26:08,333 --> 01:26:09,666
Go get 'em, tiger.

1287
01:26:17,791 --> 01:26:20,458
Rounding up the qualifying session
from the KA3

1288
01:26:20,541 --> 01:26:24,416
and it's nationals title favorite
Dean Zeta sitting on pole position.

1289
01:26:26,166 --> 01:26:27,166
Ninth.

1290
01:26:28,708 --> 01:26:29,791
Don't worry about it.

1291
01:26:30,291 --> 01:26:31,291
Refocus.

1292
01:26:32,166 --> 01:26:34,041
My steering was all over the shop.

1293
01:26:34,833 --> 01:26:36,000
I couldn't turn in properly.

1294
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,541
I've got no idea what that is.

1295
01:26:41,250 --> 01:26:42,458
I know someone who will.

1296
01:27:16,333 --> 01:27:17,333
What is it?

1297
01:27:17,875 --> 01:27:18,875
Look...

1298
01:27:19,625 --> 01:27:21,541
I know I was handed the keys to the...

1299
01:27:22,125 --> 01:27:23,291
keys to the castle...

1300
01:27:24,958 --> 01:27:26,125
and dropped them in the moat.

1301
01:27:27,083 --> 01:27:28,083
Okay?

1302
01:27:28,625 --> 01:27:30,000
What are you talking about?

1303
01:27:30,666 --> 01:27:32,333
What I'm trying to say is...

1304
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:35,708
I'm sorry for what I did.

1305
01:27:36,916 --> 01:27:38,416
If I could go back and change it...

1306
01:27:39,291 --> 01:27:40,291
I would.

1307
01:27:41,625 --> 01:27:42,625
But I can't.

1308
01:27:45,583 --> 01:27:46,750
Our team needs you.

1309
01:27:50,166 --> 01:27:51,166
I need you.

1310
01:27:54,333 --> 01:27:55,333
Please come back.

1311
01:27:56,541 --> 01:27:57,541
Please.

1312
01:27:57,875 --> 01:27:59,275
You think adding that second please

1313
01:27:59,333 --> 01:28:01,666
will make the difference
between me saying yes or no?

1314
01:28:13,958 --> 01:28:16,017
<i>With water on the track,
there won't be much grip,</i>

1315
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:18,791
<i>so we'll see the karts slip and slide
around the corners tonight.</i>

1316
01:28:18,875 --> 01:28:20,833
<i>It should make for an epic race.</i>

1317
01:28:22,833 --> 01:28:25,208
So keeps missing the apexes, right?

1318
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:27,750
It looked like he was driving
a box of cats.

1319
01:28:27,833 --> 01:28:29,375
We've got 20 minutes till the race.

1320
01:28:30,333 --> 01:28:31,333
What do you think?

1321
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:32,750
Can you fix it?

1322
01:28:33,625 --> 01:28:35,208
Of course I can. It's me.

1323
01:28:38,416 --> 01:28:39,666
What do you think you're doing?

1324
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:45,125
I'm chief engineer of this kart.

1325
01:28:45,666 --> 01:28:47,333
What?

1326
01:28:48,125 --> 01:28:49,500
What did you think I was gonna do?

1327
01:28:50,416 --> 01:28:53,375
Wait around, sorting bolts
for people who don't appreciate me?

1328
01:28:54,416 --> 01:28:55,416
Would you do that?

1329
01:28:56,416 --> 01:28:57,416
Of course not.

1330
01:28:57,916 --> 01:29:01,458
You never let me work on the kart.
We built this using my ideas.

1331
01:29:01,541 --> 01:29:04,791
It cost one tenth of yours,
and it's quick enough to beat it.

1332
01:29:09,916 --> 01:29:10,916
Come on, Amanda.

1333
01:29:12,916 --> 01:29:14,716
I'm not discussing this
in front of strangers.

1334
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:16,375
They're not strangers, Dad.

1335
01:29:17,333 --> 01:29:18,375
They're my team.

1336
01:29:29,916 --> 01:29:32,500
"They're not strangers, Dad.
They're my team."

1337
01:29:32,791 --> 01:29:34,458
Boom. That was epic.

1338
01:29:34,541 --> 01:29:37,500
Thank you. Now let's fix this kart
and win this thing, yeah?

1339
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:39,250
Dad!

1340
01:29:42,041 --> 01:29:43,500
I attack until I lead.

1341
01:29:44,041 --> 01:29:45,250
I take no prisoners.

1342
01:29:46,166 --> 01:29:47,208
I never concede.

1343
01:29:48,083 --> 01:29:51,333
Whoever said winning isn't everything
is a fool who knows nothing.

1344
01:29:52,458 --> 01:29:53,583
I am unbeatable.

1345
01:29:55,833 --> 01:29:58,208
<i>Last call for entrants
for the KA3 final.</i>

1346
01:29:58,291 --> 01:30:00,958
<i>You're required in the marshaling area
immediately.</i>

1347
01:30:03,416 --> 01:30:04,541
Are you ready?

1348
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Yeah, yeah.

1349
01:30:06,416 --> 01:30:07,708
- Do your best.
- Okay.

1350
01:30:08,208 --> 01:30:09,208
But don't be reckless.

1351
01:30:09,958 --> 01:30:11,333
I'll try not to be, but I...

1352
01:30:11,916 --> 01:30:13,166
I lose control and...

1353
01:30:13,958 --> 01:30:15,416
this anger rises inside me.

1354
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,583
Yeah, it's called the red mist.
Keep it open.

1355
01:30:18,958 --> 01:30:19,958
It has a name?

1356
01:30:20,458 --> 01:30:22,708
Yeah. It happens to a lot of people.

1357
01:30:23,416 --> 01:30:25,625
Believe me, if you want to have
any success on the track

1358
01:30:25,708 --> 01:30:26,791
or in life...

1359
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,333
you're gonna have to learn
how to control it.

1360
01:30:29,833 --> 01:30:32,416
- Okay. How do I do that?
- Well...

1361
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:35,125
the only thing that ever worked for me...

1362
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:37,666
you take a deep breath...

1363
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:39,791
and count backwards from five.

1364
01:30:40,958 --> 01:30:41,958
That's it?

1365
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,458
Sometimes the simple things work best.

1366
01:30:46,125 --> 01:30:46,958
Okay.

1367
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:48,041
Good to know.

1368
01:30:48,541 --> 01:30:51,125
So are you gonna give me
the motivational speech?

1369
01:30:51,208 --> 01:30:52,208
I mean, I think...

1370
01:30:52,791 --> 01:30:56,250
we've established that's not
my strong suit, all right, but...

1371
01:30:58,083 --> 01:30:59,083
hopefully...

1372
01:30:59,916 --> 01:31:01,208
this'll make up for it.

1373
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:04,541
Patrick...

1374
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:06,500
thank you.

1375
01:31:07,416 --> 01:31:08,496
- Jack Hooper.
- Yeah, yeah.

1376
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,041
Go on, get to it. You're burning...

1377
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:13,208
moonlight.

1378
01:31:15,875 --> 01:31:16,875
Chop chop.

1379
01:31:18,291 --> 01:31:19,291
Jack!

1380
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:21,500
Hey!

1381
01:31:30,041 --> 01:31:32,791
The last race of the night
is the KA3 class final.

1382
01:31:32,875 --> 01:31:36,833
A 20-lapper, at the end of which,
we'll have a new national champion.

1383
01:31:38,166 --> 01:31:39,166
Go, Jack!

1384
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:42,250
<i>Welcome to our television viewers

1386
01:31:44,291 --> 01:31:46,166
And they are off!

1387

- Come on, you've got this, Dean.

1390

<i>Back in the pack and the elbows are out.</i>

1391
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,833
Jack Hooper fires one up the inside

1392
01:32:07,958 --> 01:32:09,083
<i>and picks up a place.</i>

1393
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:10,958
Come on!

1394
01:32:11,333 --> 01:32:12,333
You've got it, buddy!

1395

<i>Dean Zeta, showing all of his experience,

through turn three</i>

<i>with a bucketload of understeer.</i>

1400

Woo!

1401
01:32:33,583 --> 01:32:35,458
Analyze what the other drivers are doing.

1402
01:32:35,541 --> 01:32:36,916
He's gained another place!

1403
01:32:43,875 --> 01:32:45,583
Take advantage of any mistake.

<i>Hooper gets a run

<i>Here's a chance.</i>

1409

Three.

<i>This is dangerous.

<i>Hooper cuts up the inside

Ah!

- I couldn't have done it without you.
- I know.

1440
01:34:52,208 --> 01:34:53,666
Did you count back from five?

1441
01:34:54,833 --> 01:34:55,875
Yep.

1442
01:34:56,458 --> 01:34:57,458
Pretty good, huh?

1443
01:35:06,125 --> 01:35:07,125
You did well.

3
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,683
Shh.

4
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:31,318
We're in the Bay of Silence.

5
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,387
Oh, that's right.

6
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:48,770
Now, my child,
what is your confession?

7
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:50,738
I lied yesterday.

8
00:02:50,772 --> 00:02:54,509
I see. Do you often lie,
my child?

9
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:58,579
If I say no,
will you believe me?

10
00:02:58,613 --> 00:02:59,947
Yes, absolutely.

11
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,620
And what is your confession,
my boy?

12
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:08,288
Well, I have been having
these impure thoughts

13
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,357
about a woman.

14
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,294
A very fascinating widow.

15
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:16,396
A famous artist.

16
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:18,465
How impure?

17
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,831
I wanna live here one day.

18
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,900
- We'll fix it up.
- Mmm.

19
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:54,669
Well, I can fix up anything.

20
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:58,906
Um, old bicycles,
broken hearts, anything.

21
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:03,978
Do you know what they call
this in French?

22
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,780
<i>Moule.</i>

23
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,615
But you know what it means?

24
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:09,282
Mussel. A mussel.
It's a mussel.

25
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,552
Mm, what else does it mean?

26
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:14,822
- No idea. No, no, no, no.
- Yeah.

27
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:16,423
- Really?
- <i>C'est la moule.</i>

28
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:19,060
- Can I have it?
- That's my moule!

29
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,461
I know. Now it's mine.

30
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,931
You ate my moule!

31
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,838
- Please don't.
- Sorry.

32
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:08,408
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

33
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,678
I'm fine.

34
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:17,718
Ah.

35
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:37,705
Will?

36
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:42,577
Will?

37
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:49,784
Will?

38
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:51,451
Will!

39
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,620
Argh!

40
00:05:53,154 --> 00:05:54,421
Ah!

41
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:57,658
- Don't do that.
- I... I'm sorry!

42
00:05:57,692 --> 00:05:59,627
- Don't do it.
- I didn't mean to scare you.

43
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:03,798
Please...
gimme your hand.

44
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,972
Please, say yes.

45
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:15,442
Have to consult the twins.

46
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,410
We'll get
a proper one later. Okay?

47
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:43,738
Come on.

48
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:46,040
What? No! Oh, my God,
you'll break your back!

49
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,842
But we need
to do this right.

50
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,543
But I'm so heavy.

51
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:51,746
No, you're not!
I'm strong for God sakes.

52
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,681
Look!

53
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,951
Here we are.

54
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:01,856
My God. Look at this!

55
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:03,057
Can you work here?

56
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,091
Yeah.

57
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:07,061
Come... Come.

58
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,529
Yeah, yeah.

59
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:12,099
Ow...

60
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,834
Oh, are you okay?

61
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:16,237
- All right?
- It's okay, it's just a twinge.

62
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,571
Ooh.

63
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:19,206
Mummy! Mummy!

64
00:07:21,676 --> 00:07:24,011
Mummy! Mummy!

65
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:25,478
Wait, will ya?

66
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,949
Candy kept saying fuck.

67
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:29,216
Because we got lost.

68
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,819
Yeah, well the GPS
said to drive into the canal.

69
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,488
Fuck me it's big!

70
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:38,025
You wanna go
check out the kitchen?

71
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:39,560
You mean,
shall I make some tea?

72
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:40,761
Yes, come on.

73
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:41,829
- Hey, girls.
- Hi, Will.

74
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,064
- Hi, Will.
- Hi Candy.

75
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:46,567
Oh, my gosh,
it's huge!

76
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:53,741
This is so nice.

77
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:54,976
It's heaven.

78
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,079
I'll check out the bath.

79
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:02,950
There's no milk!

80
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:06,520
- Let's bury Will!
- Yeah, let's.

81
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:07,955
No.

82
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:10,024
- Lie down, Will.
- No!

83
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:13,493
Oh, no, not in my ear!

84
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:18,132
Do you think Mummy'll have
twins like us?

85
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,968
- We want a baby each, so it'll be fair.
- Oh, do you?

86
00:08:21,402 --> 00:08:22,837
Baby each!

87
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,007
Baby each! Baby each!

88
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:30,011
Baby each! Baby each!

89
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:32,513
Hey, Will!
Lift your head up.

90
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,120
Hey, Ros, careful.

91
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:41,655
Careful!
No, Ros, no!

92
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:56,303
- What's happening?
- Excuse me.

93
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:57,605
Will.

94
00:08:57,638 --> 00:09:00,041
Drift you off to sleep now.

95
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,644
What's wrong?

96
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:08,082
- Suction...
- More suction.

97
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:12,286
- What's wrong?
- You need to leave now.

98
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:13,921
Tell me what's wrong,
please?

99
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:32,273
He's a lucky lad.

100
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:36,043
Had quite a shock
with that fall.

101
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:38,712
Didn't expect to be born
so soon, did he?

102
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:49,223
He's sleeping.

103
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,825
And he's beautiful.

104
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,994
Where is the other one?

105
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:56,897
I had twins, didn't I?

106
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:58,899
One died.

107
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:01,735
No! No, no, no, no, darling.

108
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:04,305
Just one beautiful boy.
And he needed help breathing,

109
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:06,340
- but he's very much alive.
- No.

110
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:09,110
No. I had twins again,
I saw.

111
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:11,745
They took him out?

112
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,781
Hey. Let it heal.
Let it heal.

113
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:19,954
You let them take my baby?

114
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,657
Try... Try and
get some rest.

115
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:24,992
Try and sleep,
Ros, okay?

116
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:27,361
Why did you let them
take my baby?

117
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:47,948
Why didn't you
just name him Jesus?

118
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:49,283
It's not religious, Mum.

119
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,418
Amadeo means
"loved by God".

120
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:53,254
He needed all the help
he could get.

121
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:55,356
And it's Italian.
Thought you'd like it.

122
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:58,192
Vivian, with that name he can play
for any European football team.

123
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:01,428
It's just our family has always
had such normal names.

124
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:03,464
Johnny, Tommy, Bertie.

125
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,833
Oh, yeah.
Really normal.

126
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:08,335
You look tired.

127
00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:09,737
Everything all right?

128
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:10,871
I'm fine.

129
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:14,808
Ah, Raul!

130
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,911
He's an ex-matador.
Raul...

131
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:18,179
- You okay, honey?
- I'm good.

132
00:11:18,212 --> 00:11:19,346
- Fine?
- Yeah.

133
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,481
Take him for a bit.

134
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:22,183
Hello, my darling.

135
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:27,988
Hi, Marcia.

136
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:30,090
- Fancy party.
- Fancy wife.

137
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:32,293
And that's Will's boss.

138
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:33,961
- Hey.
- Hey.

139
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:35,095
So, did you bring...

140
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,298
No, no.
Let's not go there.

141
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:38,165
There you are!

142
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:41,001
Oh, is Vivian's ex
still managing Ros?

143
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:42,336
Yeah, they're cool.

144
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,370
Mm.

145
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,942
Rosalind, my darling.

146
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:49,710
More radiant than ever.

147
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:52,446
So...

148
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,748
When do I get
my percentage?

149
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:55,916
Sorry?

150
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,220
Well, 10% of you, my darling,
means 5% of this bubala.

151
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:01,422
Milton, you might have
to run that by me.

152
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:04,959
Happy to negotiate. Ooh...

153
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:06,460
Let me
take him, honey.

154
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,128
Here.

155
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:13,167
Open the box.

156
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,073
Oh, my God!

157
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:21,775
Milton, I think he would have
been happier with a rattle.

158
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:27,147
Now, this is my bit.

159
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,384
Right... here.

160
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,086
You're spoiling her, Milton.

161
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,254
Oh, well.

162
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:39,493
- I'm so sorry.
- Milton!

163
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:41,228
Just go upstairs
and get a T-shirt.

164
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,131
Sorry about that.

165
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,432
Mmm.

166
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:47,368
Better get out of this wet shirt.

167
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:48,836
Okay.

168
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,474
Is he okay, honey?

169
00:12:53,508 --> 00:12:54,975
Yeah, he's fine.

170
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:56,810
Ooh.

171
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:58,479
You know, it might be
the flowers.

172
00:12:58,513 --> 00:12:59,813
Sure.

173
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,183
It's okay.

174
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:04,852
Here we are,
my dear Lena.

175
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:11,091
- It's all name value.
- Sorry?

176
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,027
Market is tribal.

177
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,928
Real artists don't
have a hope.

178
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:17,164
Well, my wife's work
is selling as well as ever.

179
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:19,466
I graduated in anthropology
three years ago.

180
00:13:19,501 --> 00:13:23,003
It qualifies me for babysitting
and table dancing.

181
00:13:25,573 --> 00:13:28,342
- A dark room.
- Erm, please, that's private.

182
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,279
We have these
at the Red Velvet.

183
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:34,315
The club where I dance.

184
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:36,216
Can I ask you
to go out, please?

185
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:40,522
Should come and see me
some time.

186
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:43,457
Careful.

187
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,460
To be continued.

188
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,162
No, no. Go on!

189
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,030
No, no, no,
it's time to sleep.

190
00:13:50,064 --> 00:13:52,132
- Please!
- No, no, no, no, no.

191
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,368
Time to sleep.
Good night. Good night.

192
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,237
Tickle?

193
00:13:57,271 --> 00:13:58,305
Tickle?

194
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:03,578
Tickle! Tickle! Tickle!

195
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:06,480
- All right.
- Tickle! Tickle!

196
00:14:06,514 --> 00:14:07,881
You ready?

197
00:14:08,683 --> 00:14:09,883
Ready?

198
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:18,058
Stop that!

199
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:21,228
They need to go to sleep.

200
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:25,999
All right.

201
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,401
Sleep tight, girls.

202
00:15:05,673 --> 00:15:07,107
Hey, you.

203
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:12,580
Why are you awake?

204
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:16,083
Why you not sleeping?

205
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,493
Ros?

206
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,235
Ros...

207
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:36,604
He's crying.

208
00:15:36,638 --> 00:15:38,405
And I need to get
him out.

209
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,443
Ros...

210
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:46,514
Honey, come back to bed.

211
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,552
You're dreaming.

212
00:15:51,686 --> 00:15:54,354
Come back
to bed, honey. Come.

213
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:03,531
Is Ros still upstairs?

214
00:16:03,565 --> 00:16:06,166
Yeah, she needs
a bit of rest, I think.

215
00:16:07,535 --> 00:16:09,303
Good morning, Amadeo.

216
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,250
Morning.

217
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,590
Will...

218
00:16:28,623 --> 00:16:31,158
I got a call from
Newcastle City Council.

219
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:32,594
Mmm-hmm.

220
00:16:32,627 --> 00:16:35,597
If we win this bid, we won't have
to worry for the next three years.

221
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,664
That's great.

222
00:16:36,698 --> 00:16:39,032
I'm making you project leader.
You know that.

223
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:40,502
Yeah, that's fine. Fine.

224
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:43,805
Hey, it's good.
It's all we worked for. Well done!

225
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:47,040
You know, my sister
had godawful depression

226
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:48,308
after her second child.

227
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:49,777
She's tired. That's all.

228
00:16:49,811 --> 00:16:51,245
It's gonna be fine.

229
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:00,153
<i>Hey, Will.</i>

230
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:02,422
She's taken Amadeo for a
check-up at the hospital.

231
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:03,625
<i>He's not due.</i>

232
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:05,527
Is something wrong?

233
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,694
<i>He's fine!</i>

234
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:23,811
Ros.

235
00:17:27,782 --> 00:17:30,083
They're all
nameless babies.

236
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:31,218
See?

237
00:17:33,655 --> 00:17:36,123
This is where
they buried his twin.

238
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,526
You're lying to me.

239
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,460
Ros...
No one is lying.

240
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,331
Everyone lies.

241
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:46,701
All the time.

242
00:17:58,913 --> 00:18:00,414
Milton...

243
00:18:02,884 --> 00:18:04,786
I need to talk to you.

244
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,555
About Ros.

245
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:10,390
She's a bit stressed
after the birth.

246
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:13,226
Well, no surprise there.

247
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:16,664
Dr. Muller's good.

248
00:18:16,698 --> 00:18:20,233
She's been seeing him
on and off for years.

249
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,302
More of a specialist really.

250
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:23,738
My job to know.

251
00:18:26,574 --> 00:18:28,342
Lugano is in Switzerland.

252
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,278
She's a well-travelled girl.

253
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:32,479
He Skypes.

254
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:37,250
My GP might as well
be in Switzerland.

255
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:40,420
The time it takes to get an
appointment's a bloody disgrace.

256
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,223
Here you are.

257
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:44,324
Thank you.

258
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:48,462
Oh. Do they work?

259
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,365
Some.

260
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:54,434
Collector's dispensation.

261
00:18:55,903 --> 00:18:58,773
And that's my service pistol.
On the right there.

262
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:00,575
I could never
see you in the Army.

263
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:04,378
Military intelligence.
Beats business school.

264
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:10,518
Ros, aged 14.

265
00:19:10,551 --> 00:19:13,755
Photographed by
the august John Birtram Raven,

266
00:19:13,788 --> 00:19:17,825
CBE, RA, FRPS,
the list goes on.

267
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:19,861
Bertie or JB
as I knew him.

268
00:19:19,894 --> 00:19:21,328
Vivian's brother.

269
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:22,897
Uh, step brother.

270
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,766
75 Gs on that wall.

271
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:26,634
Uh-huh.

272
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:29,904
"Bel Reve, France."

273
00:19:29,937 --> 00:19:30,772
Seaside place.

274
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:33,808
Viv inherited from him
when he died.

275
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,777
Place is a wreck.
She never goes.

276
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,813
You know,
I'm in a position to help.

277
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:39,947
Financially. Whatever.

278
00:19:39,981 --> 00:19:42,550
Milton, I can
look after us.

279
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,251
Don't be too proud, Will.

280
00:20:01,002 --> 00:20:02,369
What?

281
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:03,604
Nothing.

282
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:07,608
All the things
you don't say.

283
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:16,349
Why are you looking at me
like that?

284
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:21,421
I went to see Milton

285
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,491
about your depression.

286
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:26,928
But I'm not depressed.

287
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:30,464
Will, I'm not depressed and you
should talk to me when it's about me.

288
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:32,399
Honey, can I show you
something?

289
00:20:34,502 --> 00:20:36,303
Let me see your hand.

290
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:43,578
Do you know
how this happened?

291
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:49,984
Do you know why our brand
new wallpaper's all shredded?

292
00:20:52,754 --> 00:20:55,489
You did it.
In your sleep.

293
00:20:56,758 --> 00:20:58,358
You were sleepwalking.

294
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,990
Shh, shh, shh. What are you doing?

295
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,794
Hey, you. Bye-bye.

296
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:37,732
Uh, I'm back from
Newcastle tomorrow night.

297
00:21:37,765 --> 00:21:40,001
Please remember to pick the
girls up from swimming, okay?

298
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:41,368
Sure.

299
00:21:42,036 --> 00:21:43,470
Bye, Lena.

300
00:21:47,775 --> 00:21:49,076
Rosalind Pallister?

301
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,611
Oh, sure.

302
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,855
No, because
we're good at this.

303
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:02,557
We are good at this.

304
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:05,860
Now, how much time do you
need for the final specs?

305
00:22:05,893 --> 00:22:08,361
Three, four days?

306
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:10,765
I can't believe they need
one more bridge here.

307
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:11,899
I know.

308
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:13,400
City Center, please.

309
00:22:26,614 --> 00:22:27,682
Ros?

310
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:12,994
Ros, what's going on?
Where are the kids?

311
00:23:13,027 --> 00:23:14,595
Call me, please?

312
00:23:16,197 --> 00:23:17,899
Candy, are you
with Ros?

313
00:23:17,932 --> 00:23:19,499
Please ask her
to call me.

314
00:23:56,938 --> 00:23:58,471
Oh, for fuck's sake!

315
00:23:58,506 --> 00:23:59,874
Bloody hell!

316
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:02,610
How did you get in?

317
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,980
My dear boy,
you left the door open.

318
00:24:09,684 --> 00:24:11,786
Milton, what's going on?
Where are they?

319
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:14,522
I don't know.

320
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:16,958
She called yesterday to
say that she was leaving.

321
00:24:18,993 --> 00:24:21,028
I tried to talk her
out of it, of course.

322
00:24:21,996 --> 00:24:23,864
What happened
between you two?

323
00:24:23,898 --> 00:24:26,067
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing. Why?

324
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,735
Well, she was so angry.

325
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:29,870
So determined to leave.

326
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:32,540
I'm gonna call the police.

327
00:24:32,573 --> 00:24:34,575
- What can they do?
- She took the passports

328
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:36,844
and she took my son
maybe out of the country.

329
00:24:36,877 --> 00:24:39,213
Calm down.
Take a breath.

330
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:44,085
She's not well, Milton.
She's not well.

331
00:24:45,886 --> 00:24:46,921
I know.

332
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,592
Let me just
try her again.

333
00:24:56,998 --> 00:25:00,067
<i>Hi, Ros here.
Leave a message. Bye.</i>

334
00:25:00,101 --> 00:25:02,203
Ros, it's me. Again.

335
00:25:02,236 --> 00:25:06,540
Listen whatever this is,
whatever you think this is,

336
00:25:06,574 --> 00:25:09,010
we can work it out.
I'm sure.

337
00:25:09,043 --> 00:25:10,277
We can fix it.

338
00:25:11,746 --> 00:25:13,981
Please, call me.

339
00:25:14,015 --> 00:25:15,282
Come home.

340
00:27:33,954 --> 00:27:35,823
<i>Do you have
any of his portraits?</i>

341
00:27:35,856 --> 00:27:37,458
Unfortunately not.

342
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:41,295
His last 20 years were dedicated
to travel and landscapes.

343
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:43,464
He could make a tree knot
look subversive.

344
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:44,698
Mmm-hmm.

345
00:27:44,732 --> 00:27:48,736
I predict a 15% rise in market
value within five years.

346
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:50,070
He had a place
in France, right?

347
00:27:50,104 --> 00:27:52,373
Normandy. His early work
is very hard to get.

348
00:27:52,406 --> 00:27:54,041
I would say impossible.

349
00:28:41,288 --> 00:28:43,857
Hi, Milton, it's Will.

350
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:48,429
Did she mention that a parcel
came that day from Normandy?

351
00:28:48,462 --> 00:28:50,431
Please gimme
a call back.

352
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,095
Hello?

353
00:29:22,997 --> 00:29:25,032
Hello? Hello?

354
00:29:25,065 --> 00:29:27,001
<i>Please ask him
to come.</i>

355
00:29:28,035 --> 00:29:30,037
Girls, is that,
is that you?

356
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,805
<i>We need him
right now.</i>

357
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:34,174
<i>Someone has to come
put Mummy in the pram.</i>

358
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:35,809
What do you mean
"Mummy in the pram"?

359
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:37,512
Is Mummy there?
Can you put her on, please?

360
00:29:39,213 --> 00:29:40,881
Hello? Girls?

361
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:29,963
Fuck.

362
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:34,134
<i>I got your text
about JB's beach house.</i>

363
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:35,570
- <i>Did someone want to buy?</i>
- Where is it?

364
00:30:35,603 --> 00:30:38,238
<i>Larenguebec. No one's been
there for years.</i>

365
00:30:38,272 --> 00:30:41,241
<i>I wouldn't be surprised if it had
fallen off the edge of the cliff.</i>

366
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:43,243
<i>Everything all right?</i>

367
00:31:23,551 --> 00:31:27,488
<i>Bonjour.</i> Um, I'm looking
for this woman.

368
00:31:27,522 --> 00:31:29,957
Have you seen her?
Do you speak English?

369
00:31:31,693 --> 00:31:33,661
What do you want?

370
00:31:33,695 --> 00:31:37,297
I'm, uh, I'm looking for,
for this woman.

371
00:31:38,432 --> 00:31:39,466
Have you seen her?

372
00:31:40,968 --> 00:31:42,504
- No.
- Sure?

373
00:31:42,537 --> 00:31:43,538
Aye.

374
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:46,641
It's my wife.
My children.

375
00:31:49,143 --> 00:31:50,177
No.

376
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:25,212
Ros!

377
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:28,248
Ros!

378
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,218
Candy!

379
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,522
Ros!

380
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,335
I had it first!

381
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,506
It's mine!

382
00:32:53,808 --> 00:32:55,142
Stop!

383
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:59,146
Not fair! Give it back!

384
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:00,715
Girls!

385
00:33:00,748 --> 00:33:02,416
Ow! That hurt!

386
00:33:02,449 --> 00:33:04,218
Girls, stop fighting! Stop!

387
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:06,253
Stop, stop, stop, stop!
What are you fighting for?

388
00:33:06,286 --> 00:33:08,055
Wha... Stop.

389
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:09,256
What's going on?

390
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:13,393
You all right?
I've been worried.

391
00:33:13,427 --> 00:33:14,629
Where's Mummy?

392
00:33:14,662 --> 00:33:18,098
She doesn't come out anymore.
She has to stay in the dark.

393
00:33:19,433 --> 00:33:21,468
What d'you mean?

394
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:23,470
Where's Candy
and Amadeo?

395
00:33:23,505 --> 00:33:26,240
They're for Amadeo
to get better.

396
00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:30,712
Is... Is he not well?

397
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,413
What's wrong with him?

398
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:36,049
Has Candy
called a doctor?

399
00:33:36,551 --> 00:33:38,385
She fell in the sea.

400
00:33:38,418 --> 00:33:40,622
She did not.
She went to get help!

401
00:33:40,655 --> 00:33:42,590
Did... Did she call a doctor?
Please, girls?

402
00:33:42,624 --> 00:33:44,258
She was too scared.

403
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:46,093
She was not!
She wouldn't leave us!

404
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:47,494
Girls.
No, no, no, no!

405
00:33:50,665 --> 00:33:52,700
Let's go back now.

406
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:54,702
See if we can
find them. Right?

407
00:33:57,371 --> 00:33:58,840
Come on.
Let's find Amadeo and...

408
00:33:58,873 --> 00:34:01,441
- We'll push it.
- No, I'll push it. It's far too heavy.

409
00:34:01,475 --> 00:34:03,110
We'll push it!

410
00:34:10,117 --> 00:34:12,654
Hurry! Hurry up!
Mummy needs a doctor!

411
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:14,288
We'll leave Amadeo outside.

412
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:16,791
Stop! Stop! Girls, girls,
girls, stop. Please.

413
00:34:17,692 --> 00:34:20,360
Please, no more games.

414
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:22,296
We're not playing, Will.

415
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:51,753
Girls, I, I need you to go
and stay with Mummy now.

416
00:35:52,654 --> 00:35:53,821
Okay?

417
00:35:53,855 --> 00:35:55,056
You just go
and stay with Mummy.

418
00:35:55,089 --> 00:35:57,859
I'm gonna, I'm gonna run down
and try and get some help.

419
00:35:57,892 --> 00:35:59,060
Don't leave us!

420
00:35:59,093 --> 00:36:01,863
I need to get some help.
Please go and stay with Mummy.

421
00:36:01,896 --> 00:36:03,330
We're not grown up!

422
00:36:03,363 --> 00:36:04,632
Please, girls.

423
00:36:12,305 --> 00:36:14,307
Need some help.

424
00:36:15,275 --> 00:36:16,644
Need some help.

425
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:56,944
Ros.

426
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:01,649
What happened?

427
00:38:04,886 --> 00:38:09,056
It's me. It's Will.

428
00:38:13,094 --> 00:38:14,729
Ros...

429
00:38:17,064 --> 00:38:21,035
Amadeo, what
happened to him?

430
00:38:38,786 --> 00:38:41,856
Please...
It's me. It's Will.

431
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,025
Please.

432
00:38:45,392 --> 00:38:47,427
You need to tell me
what happened.

433
00:38:49,697 --> 00:38:51,632
Please stop it!
Stop, stop!

434
00:38:51,666 --> 00:38:53,668
Where is Candy?

435
00:38:55,603 --> 00:38:57,505
Please.

436
00:38:57,538 --> 00:39:00,440
No, Will, stop! No!

437
00:39:00,473 --> 00:39:01,976
Better!

438
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:03,611
No, no, no.

439
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:17,859
Will?

440
00:39:19,894 --> 00:39:20,928
Will!

441
00:39:22,663 --> 00:39:24,364
Will, it's you.

442
00:39:24,932 --> 00:39:26,801
Ah, it's Will.

443
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:34,575
Ah, we need rest.

444
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,678
That's all I want is rest.

445
00:39:38,813 --> 00:39:40,413
Get some rest.

446
00:39:40,848 --> 00:39:42,083
Oh...

447
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,843
Hello? Police?
Ambulance?

448
00:40:44,578 --> 00:40:45,813
Hello?

449
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:50,685
Um...

450
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:52,520
<i>Hello?</i>

451
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:57,024
<i>Hello?</i> Monsieur?

452
00:44:51,825 --> 00:44:53,427
We're hungry.

453
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,864
We'll get something on the
road when we're packed.

454
00:44:56,897 --> 00:44:59,200
Should we take Amadeo
to the beach?

455
00:45:02,336 --> 00:45:05,239
Girls...

456
00:45:05,272 --> 00:45:07,908
do you remember when
we found that baby bird

457
00:45:07,942 --> 00:45:09,877
that had fallen
from its nest?

458
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:11,979
Who couldn't hold
his head up.

459
00:45:12,012 --> 00:45:13,447
Yes. We buried him.

460
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,450
Put a stone to remember him
by, to keep him safe.

461
00:45:16,483 --> 00:45:18,385
So he could go
to Heaven.

462
00:45:19,153 --> 00:45:21,488
Yeah. That's right.

463
00:45:21,523 --> 00:45:23,390
Is Mummy going
to heaven, too?

464
00:45:23,424 --> 00:45:25,527
Mummy will be fine.

465
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,194
We just need
to help her.

466
00:45:29,496 --> 00:45:31,265
Just take it easy.

467
00:45:31,298 --> 00:45:33,234
It's fine, it's fine.

468
00:45:33,267 --> 00:45:35,503
We're just going
up to the car.

469
00:45:35,537 --> 00:45:37,104
All right. Come on.

470
00:45:38,405 --> 00:45:40,874
Come on, you can do it.
It's all right.

471
00:45:41,842 --> 00:45:44,311
Hey. Is she okay?

472
00:45:44,345 --> 00:45:47,481
Yeah, she's fine, thank you.
I'm just taking her home.

473
00:45:47,515 --> 00:45:48,916
She's well,
no problem.

474
00:45:48,949 --> 00:45:50,284
Thank you. Thank you.

475
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:54,188
Take it easy, honey.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

476
00:45:54,221 --> 00:45:56,457
Come on,
we're getting into the car.

477
00:46:04,832 --> 00:46:06,900
Can I, can I ask you...
Please let go of her.

478
00:46:06,934 --> 00:46:08,902
Come on, darling,
we need to go.

479
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:11,272
Darling, darling,
come on.

480
00:46:12,373 --> 00:46:13,541
- Yes, thank you.
- Doctor.

481
00:46:13,575 --> 00:46:14,808
- Thank you.
- Doc... understand?

482
00:46:14,842 --> 00:46:16,377
Thank you, I understand.
Thank you.

483
00:46:19,514 --> 00:46:22,082
Just need to get
in the car. Come on.

484
00:47:49,637 --> 00:47:51,405
I came as quickly as I could.

485
00:47:54,308 --> 00:47:56,243
She was off her medication?

486
00:47:56,276 --> 00:47:57,444
She's stabilized now.

487
00:48:02,249 --> 00:48:03,250
Where's that Candy?

488
00:48:04,451 --> 00:48:06,353
Being useful with the baby
for once, I hope?

489
00:48:06,387 --> 00:48:08,623
We need to talk.

490
00:48:08,656 --> 00:48:12,660
She hasn't had an episode in...
three years.

491
00:48:12,694 --> 00:48:13,994
Not since she met you.

492
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:18,031
Milton told me
how worried you are.

493
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:20,134
That he gave you
Dr. Muller's number.

494
00:48:21,068 --> 00:48:22,169
Yes, that's right.

495
00:48:22,202 --> 00:48:25,540
But before that I'd never heard
your name. Not once.

496
00:48:25,573 --> 00:48:28,242
It's printed on the medication.

497
00:48:28,275 --> 00:48:31,245
- Well, that's for migraine.
- That's what she told you?

498
00:48:31,278 --> 00:48:32,547
How could you not know?

499
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,715
It's not uncommon.

500
00:48:33,748 --> 00:48:37,351
Even if she wanted to tell you,
she probably couldn't.

501
00:48:37,384 --> 00:48:40,320
Dissociative memory loss
is a well know side effect

502
00:48:40,354 --> 00:48:41,589
of a schizophrenic breakdown.

503
00:48:44,391 --> 00:48:45,560
She's schizophrenic?

504
00:48:50,598 --> 00:48:53,000
And... And when did she
come here the first time?

505
00:48:55,402 --> 00:48:57,539
- When she was 14.
- 14!

506
00:49:02,544 --> 00:49:03,711
It was, um...

507
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:07,047
JB's summer assistant,

508
00:49:08,148 --> 00:49:09,551
Pierre Laurent.

509
00:49:09,584 --> 00:49:11,385
They say it was rape.

510
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:14,254
He got the maximum.

511
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:16,089
Milton's lawyers
made sure of it.

512
00:49:16,123 --> 00:49:18,025
Of course, the villagers
took his side.

513
00:49:18,058 --> 00:49:20,662
Village...
where I found her?

514
00:49:20,695 --> 00:49:22,597
God knows why
she went back there.

515
00:49:25,065 --> 00:49:26,133
Is this him?

516
00:49:32,674 --> 00:49:34,509
He forgives her?

517
00:49:34,542 --> 00:49:36,410
He destroyed her childhood!

518
00:49:38,245 --> 00:49:39,480
Where did you get this?

519
00:49:39,514 --> 00:49:41,281
I was too late, Vivian.

520
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:43,183
I mean, if only you'd
told me when she couldn't,

521
00:49:43,217 --> 00:49:44,351
but you didn't.

522
00:49:44,384 --> 00:49:46,654
If only I'd known,
none of this would have happened.

523
00:49:46,688 --> 00:49:47,988
None of it.

524
00:49:54,796 --> 00:49:56,196
You buried him?

525
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,131
I tried to save her, Vivian.

526
00:49:58,165 --> 00:49:59,466
I tried to save us all.

527
00:49:59,501 --> 00:50:00,802
Candy was missing,

528
00:50:00,835 --> 00:50:03,671
and every scenario ended up
with Ros being blamed.

529
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:08,442
I was in shock
for fuck's sake!

530
00:50:13,615 --> 00:50:16,283
I have to face up.
Go to the authorities.

531
00:50:16,316 --> 00:50:19,019
No. She's my daughter.
You don't think that...

532
00:50:21,255 --> 00:50:24,559
- You can't think that she...
- I don't think anything.

533
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:27,227
My son is dead.

534
00:50:28,328 --> 00:50:30,497
Amadeo is dead.

535
00:50:37,271 --> 00:50:40,073
Is there anything else
I need to know, Vivian?

536
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:45,613
Go. Find Candy.

537
00:50:47,214 --> 00:50:50,384
I'll look after my daughter
and my grandchildren.

538
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:53,086
But please,
think of them first.

539
00:51:04,766 --> 00:51:07,735
A Mrs. Joy Williams.

540
00:51:07,769 --> 00:51:10,705
I'm looking
for her sister Candy.

541
00:51:10,738 --> 00:51:13,541
Have you got
a forwarding address, please?

542
00:51:14,408 --> 00:51:15,510
Or a number?

543
00:51:17,177 --> 00:51:18,813
All right.

544
00:51:18,846 --> 00:51:20,515
Thank you.

545
00:52:26,413 --> 00:52:27,381
Yes?

546
00:52:27,414 --> 00:52:28,248
<i>Is that Mr. Pallister?</i>

547
00:52:28,281 --> 00:52:30,518
- Walsh.
- <i>Rosalind's husband right?</i>

548
00:52:30,551 --> 00:52:32,319
- Yes.
- <i>Love her work.</i>

549
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,188
<i>About the car accident.</i>

550
00:52:35,222 --> 00:52:36,557
<i>Can you confirm
where it happened?</i>

551
00:53:23,604 --> 00:53:26,007
Sooner or later, every man
has something to hide.

552
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,308
I need to tell the truth, Mil.

553
00:53:28,341 --> 00:53:29,777
Oh, you buried the truth.

554
00:53:29,811 --> 00:53:32,013
I'm not saying
it was the wrong decision,

555
00:53:32,046 --> 00:53:34,214
but you do have to think
how it might look.

556
00:53:35,817 --> 00:53:38,418
I kept it simple.
Car accident abroad.

557
00:53:38,452 --> 00:53:39,954
But, but this guy
and her past...

558
00:53:39,987 --> 00:53:41,522
I've been checking regularly.

559
00:53:41,556 --> 00:53:42,690
No one's picked it up.

560
00:53:42,724 --> 00:53:44,491
A journalist has been
calling the house.

561
00:53:44,525 --> 00:53:46,728
- I mean, I'm being followed.
- Will...

562
00:53:46,761 --> 00:53:48,629
You have to get a grip.

563
00:53:48,663 --> 00:53:51,999
Look, French death certificate

564
00:53:52,033 --> 00:53:53,534
police accident report,

565
00:53:53,568 --> 00:53:55,737
all verified
by the French Consulate.

566
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:58,371
- How?
- I'll settle for a thank you.

567
00:53:58,405 --> 00:53:59,439
Plus...

568
00:54:01,509 --> 00:54:03,644
- Please...
- It'll tide you over.

569
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,415
Priorities.
Rosalind and the twins.

570
00:54:08,448 --> 00:54:10,383
- Hmm.
- We wait for Rosalind to improve.

571
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:11,853
When she talks,
then we decide.

572
00:54:11,886 --> 00:54:13,888
- Not before.
- And what about Candy?

573
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:15,623
Well, Candy's disappearance

574
00:54:15,656 --> 00:54:16,724
points to guilt,
wouldn't you say?

575
00:54:16,758 --> 00:54:18,492
Even more reason
to go to the police.

576
00:54:18,526 --> 00:54:21,361
Oh, no, let's leave the
police out of it for now.

577
00:54:21,394 --> 00:54:22,897
Milton, I need to know.

578
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:25,533
I need to find out
how he died.

579
00:54:39,914 --> 00:54:40,915
Thank you.

580
00:54:41,549 --> 00:54:43,518
Uh, I'm looking for Becca.

581
00:54:44,484 --> 00:54:46,319
Becca, does she work here?

582
00:54:57,497 --> 00:55:00,668
Please tell her a friend
was in a car accident.

583
00:55:00,701 --> 00:55:01,803
Thank you.

584
00:55:47,447 --> 00:55:51,853
99.9 percent certain these are
from the lost Normandy series,

585
00:55:51,886 --> 00:55:53,420
<i>In the Garden of Good
and Evil.</i>

586
00:55:53,453 --> 00:55:55,122
And no one else
could have taken them?

587
00:55:55,156 --> 00:55:56,489
Oh, I don't think so.

588
00:55:58,025 --> 00:55:59,060
Where did you get them?

589
00:56:00,094 --> 00:56:02,063
Private collection.

590
00:56:02,096 --> 00:56:03,998
You know his assistant
was jailed for rape?

591
00:56:04,031 --> 00:56:06,399
- Yes, yes.
- They found incriminating photos

592
00:56:06,433 --> 00:56:08,401
of the underage victim
in his home.

593
00:56:08,435 --> 00:56:09,937
He claimed that
he was framed.

594
00:56:09,971 --> 00:56:12,106
- That the photos...
- Were Raven's, I know, yeah.

595
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:14,441
Well, he was
a celebrated photographer.

596
00:56:14,474 --> 00:56:16,409
The assistant
didn't stand a chance.

597
00:56:17,578 --> 00:56:19,947
But surely
the victim must have...

598
00:56:19,981 --> 00:56:22,049
Too traumatized to testify.

599
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:23,383
Allegedly.

600
00:56:25,019 --> 00:56:26,486
Think it was her?

601
00:56:40,935 --> 00:56:42,003
How is she?

602
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,404
She's, um...

603
00:56:46,173 --> 00:56:47,742
She's coming home.

604
00:56:48,876 --> 00:56:49,877
Soon.

605
00:56:52,647 --> 00:56:54,414
Will, what happened
out there?

606
00:56:58,219 --> 00:57:00,487
My wife is coming home
in a couple of days,

607
00:57:02,256 --> 00:57:04,191
and I don't know
how to deal with it.

608
00:57:07,862 --> 00:57:08,963
I wish I did.

609
00:57:12,667 --> 00:57:16,570
Oh, Lena,
they look so wonderful.

610
00:57:21,909 --> 00:57:25,846
I was so sad to hear
about the accident.

611
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,249
Everything that happened.

612
00:57:30,017 --> 00:57:32,620
Lena, thank you
for all your help.

613
00:57:32,653 --> 00:57:34,522
Ros really needs to rest now.

614
00:57:34,555 --> 00:57:37,091
You go to bed.
I made borscht.

615
00:57:37,124 --> 00:57:38,993
Borscht is fine.

616
00:57:40,995 --> 00:57:43,097
I miss the twins.

617
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,699
They're fine
with your mother.

618
00:57:44,732 --> 00:57:46,233
- It's gonna be all right.
- Yeah.

619
00:58:50,364 --> 00:58:51,799
Hi.

620
00:58:51,832 --> 00:58:52,833
Hi.

621
00:59:04,011 --> 00:59:05,846
I don't remember
making these.

622
00:59:11,986 --> 00:59:14,221
Mum says there was
a car accident...

623
00:59:15,389 --> 00:59:16,891
and our baby died.

624
00:59:19,894 --> 00:59:22,129
Which is why
I was ill for so long.

625
00:59:26,033 --> 00:59:27,301
I know I had a baby,

626
00:59:29,937 --> 00:59:32,339
but I can't find
any of his things.

627
00:59:34,942 --> 00:59:36,277
I packed them up.

628
00:59:36,944 --> 00:59:37,945
Why?

629
00:59:42,283 --> 00:59:43,784
Guess it hurt.

630
00:59:46,287 --> 00:59:47,588
I was angry.

631
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:51,959
- Angry?
- Yes.

632
00:59:51,992 --> 00:59:54,829
Ros, can you please try
and make me understand?

633
00:59:55,996 --> 00:59:57,698
Talk me through
what happened.

634
01:00:05,706 --> 01:00:09,009
Listen, I know, I...
Maybe I should have asked, but...

635
01:00:11,212 --> 01:00:14,381
Why didn't you tell me that
you needed those prescriptions?

636
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:21,989
Why did you stop
taking your pills?

637
01:00:38,272 --> 01:00:40,841
- <i>We miss you, Mummy!</i>
- I miss you, too.

638
01:00:40,875 --> 01:00:43,277
Hi, girls. All good?

639
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:44,445
<i>We're gonna leave now.</i>

640
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:47,014
<i>To the mountains with ponies.</i>

641
01:00:47,047 --> 01:00:48,349
And then home.

642
01:00:48,382 --> 01:00:50,084
<i>When Mummy's better.</i>

643
01:00:50,117 --> 01:00:54,155
Oh, but, I am better.
Aren't I, Lena?

644
01:00:54,188 --> 01:00:58,025
We see you
very soon, darlings.

645
01:00:58,058 --> 01:01:01,362
<i>Bye.</i>

646
01:01:12,339 --> 01:01:13,474
Hey, excuse me.

647
01:01:13,508 --> 01:01:16,110
Can you help me?
I'm looking for a girl called Becca.

648
01:01:16,143 --> 01:01:18,112
I think she works here.

649
01:01:18,145 --> 01:01:19,446
Perhaps she's
got a different name here.

650
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,714
- I mean...
- Fuck off, will you?

651
01:01:20,748 --> 01:01:21,749
Hey. I'm just...

652
01:01:23,851 --> 01:01:25,085
Take it easy.

653
01:02:38,359 --> 01:02:39,960
Let's just leave the city.

654
01:02:41,061 --> 01:02:42,564
Go to the sun.

655
01:02:42,597 --> 01:02:45,199
Find an old house on a cliff.

656
01:02:45,232 --> 01:02:48,269
You know, like the one
in Sestri you love so much.

657
01:02:48,302 --> 01:02:49,803
Are you asking me
to marry you?

658
01:02:51,305 --> 01:02:54,008
See, my memory's
getting better.

659
01:02:56,076 --> 01:02:58,879
You know, the girls
can go to a local school.

660
01:02:58,912 --> 01:03:01,849
I can work remotely,
or get something local.

661
01:03:01,882 --> 01:03:04,885
- I mean ev...
- If we had a car accident,

662
01:03:04,918 --> 01:03:07,254
how come we still have
the same car?

663
01:03:35,382 --> 01:03:36,850
I remember.

664
01:03:39,253 --> 01:03:40,522
I remember

665
01:03:41,955 --> 01:03:44,559
I didn't want
to take my pills anymore.

666
01:03:46,093 --> 01:03:49,363
When I felt him
in my belly, growing,

667
01:03:51,198 --> 01:03:53,167
because I didn't
want to hurt him.

668
01:03:56,303 --> 01:03:57,304
Go on.

669
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:01,208
And, er,

670
01:04:01,942 --> 01:04:03,243
I remember...

671
01:04:04,579 --> 01:04:07,214
hands pulling me
through the window.

672
01:04:08,382 --> 01:04:10,184
The twins crying.

673
01:04:15,623 --> 01:04:18,025
Was that the accident
Mum told me about?

674
01:04:21,629 --> 01:04:23,964
That was no car accident.

675
01:04:29,236 --> 01:04:31,004
Amadeo died.

676
01:04:32,439 --> 01:04:34,208
And we don't know why.

677
01:05:24,726 --> 01:05:25,959
Hey.

678
01:05:26,994 --> 01:05:28,328
What are you
doing with that?

679
01:05:28,362 --> 01:05:31,131
Mr. Milton tell me he
want me to give it to him.

680
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:32,600
Milton?

681
01:05:32,634 --> 01:05:35,169
He said it's okay with
you and Miss Rosalind.

682
01:05:36,638 --> 01:05:38,540
How did you even know
where to find it?

683
01:05:41,175 --> 01:05:42,309
Give it to me.

684
01:05:42,342 --> 01:05:43,977
Give it to me!

685
01:05:45,245 --> 01:05:46,346
What's going on?

686
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:56,156
What are you doing
with this case?

687
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:57,224
Let's wait with this one.

688
01:05:57,257 --> 01:05:58,726
- Let's, let's, let's...
- Wait, wait. Is this...

689
01:06:03,798 --> 01:06:05,432
Have you got a key
to our house?

690
01:06:06,433 --> 01:06:08,469
I'm taking Rosalind
for tea.

691
01:06:08,503 --> 01:06:09,671
Isn't that right, Ros?

692
01:06:11,138 --> 01:06:13,006
To er,
to talk about this?

693
01:06:14,576 --> 01:06:16,043
You opened it.

694
01:06:16,076 --> 01:06:17,077
Why?

695
01:06:17,377 --> 01:06:19,313
Ask him.

696
01:06:19,346 --> 01:06:21,215
- I've never opened it.
- No.

697
01:06:21,248 --> 01:06:22,784
Well, let's wait
till you're better.

698
01:06:22,817 --> 01:06:24,251
Oh, no, I am better.

699
01:06:24,284 --> 01:06:25,452
You don't know that.

700
01:06:26,688 --> 01:06:28,021
The doctor says I'm better.

701
01:06:28,055 --> 01:06:29,323
I... I feel better.

702
01:06:29,356 --> 01:06:31,693
I look better.
I'm better.

703
01:06:33,661 --> 01:06:35,295
I'm fucking better, okay?

704
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:36,664
Then why are you yelling?

705
01:06:37,431 --> 01:06:38,633
Because it's you.

706
01:06:38,666 --> 01:06:40,200
You made this place
a morgue.

707
01:06:40,234 --> 01:06:42,135
Ros, it is a morgue.

708
01:06:42,169 --> 01:06:44,238
Our son is dead.
You took him and he died.

709
01:06:44,271 --> 01:06:45,305
- Stop it, Will.
- How dare you?

710
01:06:45,339 --> 01:06:47,140
- How dare you?
- Your memory

711
01:06:47,174 --> 01:06:48,643
- is so convenient, isn't it?
- Let me go!

712
01:06:48,676 --> 01:06:50,210
You're hurting...

713
01:06:50,244 --> 01:06:51,579
- No!
- Amadeo.

714
01:06:51,613 --> 01:06:52,680
- Remember?
- No.

715
01:06:52,714 --> 01:06:53,748
- No? No.
- No. No.

716
01:06:53,781 --> 01:06:54,682
- Enough!
- So convenient, isn't it?

717
01:06:54,716 --> 01:06:56,784
- I don't remember.
- Outside, Will. Outside!

718
01:06:56,818 --> 01:06:58,185
I don't remember!

719
01:06:59,086 --> 01:07:00,153
Wait.

720
01:07:06,761 --> 01:07:08,796
I've worked out
why you're so desperate

721
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:11,064
for those missing photos.

722
01:07:11,098 --> 01:07:13,066
To save your precious
Raven's arse!

723
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:14,468
I won't let you
unravel this.

724
01:07:14,502 --> 01:07:15,637
Fuck you!

725
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:17,204
It needs to disappear.

726
01:07:17,237 --> 01:07:18,405
Stay buried.

727
01:07:18,438 --> 01:07:22,777
Nothing can be gained from
Rosalind reliving this trauma.

728
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:26,179
You want the twins
taken away from her? Hmm?

729
01:07:26,213 --> 01:07:28,448
Taken away from you?
Is that what you want?

730
01:07:30,852 --> 01:07:33,186
We have to protect
the ones we love.

731
01:07:48,536 --> 01:07:50,838
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

732
01:08:03,417 --> 01:08:05,419

01:08:13,393 --> 01:08:15,295

<i>Hey, it's Becca.</i>

740
01:09:14,656 --> 01:09:17,592
- So...
- I haven't seen her in weeks.

741
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:19,594
She's off Facebook,
Instagram,

742
01:09:19,627 --> 01:09:20,895
her phone just rings.

743
01:09:20,928 --> 01:09:22,429
Becca.

744
01:09:22,462 --> 01:09:25,833
Please, help me.

745
01:09:25,867 --> 01:09:28,503
I really need to find
out where she is.

746
01:09:29,103 --> 01:09:30,505
Have you tried
her mum?

747
01:09:30,538 --> 01:09:32,305
- Yes. Yes.
- Her sister?

748
01:09:34,474 --> 01:09:36,443
Look, I read
about the car crash.

749
01:09:36,476 --> 01:09:38,445
I'm so sorry.

750
01:09:38,478 --> 01:09:40,682
No, Becca, listen. Can we...

751
01:09:45,485 --> 01:09:46,587
I'll be next door.

752
01:09:47,454 --> 01:09:49,524
So now what?
You're gonna blackmail me?

753
01:09:49,557 --> 01:09:50,892
Not if you listen.

754
01:09:58,132 --> 01:09:59,901
So those videos...

755
01:09:59,934 --> 01:10:01,301
That was you?

756
01:10:02,537 --> 01:10:05,472
<i>Amadeo, you should
lie down, darling.</i>

757
01:10:05,506 --> 01:10:06,874
<i>You need to rest.</i>

758
01:10:08,009 --> 01:10:09,544
<i>You okay, darling?</i>

759
01:10:10,912 --> 01:10:12,647
<i>Are you a bit hot?</i>

760
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:13,715
<i>Yeah.</i>

761
01:10:13,748 --> 01:10:14,682
So he was sick?

762
01:10:14,716 --> 01:10:16,851
It seemed like a summer cold.
That's all.

763
01:10:20,521 --> 01:10:22,322
The villagers hated us.

764
01:10:22,355 --> 01:10:23,858
We'd throw those crabs out.

765
01:10:23,891 --> 01:10:25,560
In the morning
they'd be back.

766
01:10:26,594 --> 01:10:27,762
Stank.

767
01:10:28,462 --> 01:10:30,832
Made Ros mad.

768
01:10:30,865 --> 01:10:32,700
She yelled at them
in the bar.

769
01:10:35,469 --> 01:10:37,337
She was having
problems before we left.

770
01:10:38,873 --> 01:10:40,340
She rang Milton.

771
01:10:40,373 --> 01:10:41,542
Screamed and yelled at him.

772
01:10:41,576 --> 01:10:44,011
Then started packing.

773
01:10:44,045 --> 01:10:46,681
She kept saying everything
was her fault.

774
01:10:48,015 --> 01:10:51,384
She was obsessed with finding
the guy that sent the parcel.

775
01:10:51,819 --> 01:10:53,286
Who is he?

776
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,622
She wouldn't say.

777
01:10:54,655 --> 01:10:56,724
The night on the beach,
I saw them.

778
01:10:56,758 --> 01:10:58,659
That night just sent her
over the edge.

779
01:11:01,629 --> 01:11:02,630
<i>Ros.</i>

780
01:11:07,434 --> 01:11:08,368
- <i>Don't make a noise.</i>
- <i>You're scaring them.</i>

781
01:11:08,401 --> 01:11:11,304
<i>No,
we have to hide. No.</i>

782
01:11:11,338 --> 01:11:12,974
<i>No, put them back on!</i>

783
01:11:13,007 --> 01:11:14,509
<i>Put them back on!</i>

784
01:11:14,542 --> 01:11:15,910
Somebody's
stolen his twin.

785
01:11:15,943 --> 01:11:17,545
We had to protect Amadeo.

786
01:11:17,578 --> 01:11:19,412
<i>Get out!</i>

787
01:11:19,446 --> 01:11:22,016
<i>Get out of here!</i>

788
01:11:22,049 --> 01:11:25,787
She locked his bedroom
door and wouldn't let anyone in.

789
01:11:27,922 --> 01:11:29,456
The next morning...

790
01:11:31,092 --> 01:11:32,560
<i>Amadeo?</i>

791
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:36,631
<i>Ros!</i>

792
01:11:37,899 --> 01:11:39,967
I got scared and ran.

793
01:11:41,636 --> 01:11:43,805
I'm sorry.

794
01:11:43,838 --> 01:11:44,906
I loved him.

795
01:11:45,973 --> 01:11:47,975
But so did Ros.

796
01:12:27,081 --> 01:12:28,683
How did I get here?

797
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:30,751
Mmm...

798
01:12:34,822 --> 01:12:37,058
Ah, these are not mine.

799
01:12:38,092 --> 01:12:39,994
Mild sedative.

800
01:12:40,027 --> 01:12:41,529
Doctor's orders.

801
01:12:58,946 --> 01:13:00,548
I want the twins.

802
01:13:01,015 --> 01:13:02,617
In good time.

803
01:13:09,023 --> 01:13:11,525
Please, let me sleep.

804
01:13:27,541 --> 01:13:28,576
Ros?

805
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:34,615
Milton, let me in
for God's sake!

806
01:13:36,884 --> 01:13:38,953
Milton!

807
01:13:40,988 --> 01:13:42,823
Milton!

808
01:13:44,992 --> 01:13:46,493
Police?

809
01:13:47,628 --> 01:13:49,630
Milton!

810
01:13:49,664 --> 01:13:51,198
Open the door!

811
01:13:53,734 --> 01:13:55,603
Milton, let me in!

812
01:13:56,237 --> 01:13:57,838
Please! Five minutes!

813
01:14:00,942 --> 01:14:02,677
Open the door!

814
01:14:26,767 --> 01:14:29,603
Milton! Open the
God damn door!

815
01:14:30,938 --> 01:14:32,540
Milton!

816
01:15:04,038 --> 01:15:05,072
You.

817
01:15:05,106 --> 01:15:06,674
I just want to help you.

818
01:15:07,008 --> 01:15:08,009
Okay?

819
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:11,112
You're Pierre Laurent.

820
01:15:11,145 --> 01:15:12,847
Tell me what
you know about my son.

821
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,281
I know nothing
about your son.

822
01:15:20,654 --> 01:15:23,691
At the trial they called me
photographer's assistant.

823
01:15:24,725 --> 01:15:28,562
I was not.
I was doing everything,

824
01:15:28,596 --> 01:15:30,131
but touch a camera, never.

825
01:15:31,932 --> 01:15:36,070
<i>One night, she came to me
carrying a camera case.</i>

826
01:15:36,103 --> 01:15:37,671
<i>She wanted a place
to hide it.</i>

827
01:15:40,841 --> 01:15:44,612
<i>She asked me to wait
while she buried it.</i>

828
01:15:44,645 --> 01:15:46,347
<i>And when she's done,
she starts running.</i>

829
01:15:51,318 --> 01:15:52,353
<i>But when I touch her,</i>

830
01:15:52,386 --> 01:15:54,221
<i>she starts screaming.</i>

831
01:15:58,092 --> 01:16:01,095
<i>For years, I expected
the prison door to open</i>

832
01:16:01,128 --> 01:16:03,631
<i>and see her
standing there,</i>

833
01:16:03,664 --> 01:16:05,266
<i>saying she was sorry.</i>

834
01:16:07,701 --> 01:16:09,670
You know,
after I came out,

835
01:16:09,703 --> 01:16:11,272
I searched
for that hiding place.

836
01:16:12,807 --> 01:16:14,608
It had been 20 years.
I found it.

837
01:16:18,012 --> 01:16:19,713
But why send them
to her now?

838
01:16:21,082 --> 01:16:22,083
Raven's dead.

839
01:16:23,184 --> 01:16:24,285
But Milton is not.

840
01:16:32,359 --> 01:16:33,727
Look at the ring
on his finger.

841
01:16:44,805 --> 01:16:45,806
You want her?

842
01:16:46,307 --> 01:16:47,308
I want him.

843
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:19,073
<i>Milton,
I know it was you.</i>

844
01:17:19,106 --> 01:17:20,841
You don't know
what you're talking about.

845
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:22,343
<i>I have proof.</i>

846
01:17:22,376 --> 01:17:25,012
<i>But I'll leave you alone
if you let me take my wife.</i>

847
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:04,211
Stay still.

848
01:20:05,072 --> 01:20:06,273
I'm a quiet man.

849
01:20:07,509 --> 01:20:08,510
Hate fuss.

850
01:20:11,613 --> 01:20:12,813
Work hard.

851
01:20:14,315 --> 01:20:15,449
People rely on me.

852
01:20:20,187 --> 01:20:21,589
After all
I've done for you.

853
01:20:21,623 --> 01:20:22,657
Where is she?

854
01:20:22,691 --> 01:20:26,126
Rosalind's always understood
what she was doing.

855
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:28,128
- You just don't get it.
- You know that's a lie.

856
01:20:30,665 --> 01:20:33,100
That signet ring
you're so proud of.

857
01:20:35,002 --> 01:20:36,170
It's there.

858
01:20:36,203 --> 01:20:38,205
In every picture.

859
01:20:39,541 --> 01:20:43,010
You know, it really
is a tight-knit,

860
01:20:43,043 --> 01:20:45,613
self-preserving
little community at the top.

861
01:20:47,515 --> 01:20:49,116
I could have you
put away for life.

862
01:20:50,184 --> 01:20:52,587
You screwed it up
all by yourself.

863
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:55,122
Buried him in some
misguided belief

864
01:20:55,155 --> 01:20:56,423
you were saving
the woman you love.

865
01:20:56,457 --> 01:20:57,625
You're a sick person.

866
01:20:57,659 --> 01:20:59,126
No.

867
01:20:59,159 --> 01:21:00,595
I was different
from JB.

868
01:21:01,629 --> 01:21:02,630
I just loved her.

869
01:21:03,531 --> 01:21:05,432
I adored her.

870
01:21:13,073 --> 01:21:14,241
I own her.

871
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:17,044
I always have.

872
01:21:28,455 --> 01:21:29,657
What did I ever
do to you?

873
01:21:31,291 --> 01:21:33,360
Please, stop.
I beg you.

874
01:21:33,394 --> 01:21:35,095
Did you stop
when I begged you?

875
01:21:35,462 --> 01:21:36,497
No, please!

876
01:21:37,431 --> 01:21:40,267
You said Pierre
did those things to me.

877
01:21:42,236 --> 01:21:43,237
He was my friend.

878
01:21:48,175 --> 01:21:49,176
Why?

879
01:21:51,513 --> 01:21:52,514
I want to know.

880
01:21:53,615 --> 01:21:54,649
I want your love.

881
01:21:55,315 --> 01:21:56,917
That's all
I ever wanted.

882
01:21:59,654 --> 01:22:00,655
Ros.

883
01:22:03,157 --> 01:22:04,458
Ros.

884
01:22:04,491 --> 01:22:05,492
I need you.

885
01:22:09,196 --> 01:22:10,565
The twins need you.

886
01:22:12,734 --> 01:22:13,934
Don't.

887
01:24:06,146 --> 01:24:07,147
Careful, girls.

888
01:24:08,583 --> 01:24:10,150
Hatty!
Hatty, come back.

889
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:13,621
You'll need your towel.

890
01:24:17,391 --> 01:24:18,626
Where are you going?

891
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:19,661
Where are you going?

892
01:24:33,741 --> 01:24:35,208
<i>Uno.</i>

893
01:24:35,242 --> 01:24:37,311
- <i>Due.</i>
- <i>Due.</i>

894
01:24:37,344 --> 01:24:39,413
- <i>Tre.</i>
- <i>Tre.</i>

895
01:24:39,446 --> 01:24:41,181
- <i>Quattro.</i>
- <i>Quattro.</i>

896
01:24:41,214 --> 01:24:42,550
What comes next?

897
01:24:44,184 --> 01:24:45,419
What?

898
01:24:51,258 --> 01:24:52,359
What about the toes?

899
01:24:52,392 --> 01:24:54,161
We already
covered your feet.

900
01:24:54,194 --> 01:24:55,563
Did you?

901
01:24:55,597 --> 01:24:56,598
I can see them.

902
01:24:57,230 --> 01:24:59,634
Oh, I just
covered them.

903
01:25:00,233 --> 01:25:01,234
Cheeky.

904
01:25:03,705 --> 01:25:04,739
Are you gonna
leave me here?

905
01:25:10,612 --> 01:25:11,613
I can't move.

906
01:25:47,347 --> 01:25:48,783
We're in
the Bay of Silence.

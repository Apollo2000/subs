2
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:01,496
Chul Woo?

3
00:01:02,056 --> 00:01:03,216
Chul Woo?

4
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:07,056
Wake up.
It's time to collect the nets.

5
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:12,576
You have to wake up.
Come on, now.

6
00:01:15,316 --> 00:01:16,916
It's cold outside.

7
00:01:41,374 --> 00:01:42,614
Here you go.

8
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,998
Is it torn?

9
00:02:07,236 --> 00:02:08,716
Why are you laughing?

10
00:02:09,276 --> 00:02:10,596
Nothing.

11
00:02:11,192 --> 00:02:13,312
Tell me.
What's so funny?

12
00:02:16,556 --> 00:02:19,396
I think you look...

13
00:02:19,636 --> 00:02:21,476
...handsome in the morning.

14
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:25,779
Is that so?

15
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:31,569
I can be more charming.

16
00:02:32,316 --> 00:02:36,236
- What are you doing?
- Come here.

17
00:02:39,653 --> 00:02:41,293
You'll wake her up!

18
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:56,431
Beautiful girl.
How old is she?

19
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,886
She's 7 now.

20
00:03:58,456 --> 00:04:00,016
Same age as my daughter.

21
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:01,887
Is that so?

22
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,643
You might have hard time seeing
because of the fog.

23
00:04:07,195 --> 00:04:09,875
- Don't get too far away.
- I won't.

24
00:04:11,191 --> 00:04:15,031
There's a strong current
towards the South, stay away from there.

25
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:16,789
Alright.

26
00:04:21,855 --> 00:04:23,055
Comrade!

27
00:04:23,936 --> 00:04:25,496
Just out of curiosity...

28
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:29,776
What would you do
if your boat gets dragged to the South?

29
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,410
Would you jump into the water?

30
00:04:33,977 --> 00:04:37,097
- This boat is all I have.
- So?

31
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:42,317
- Will you go to South Korea?
- I will never go there.

32
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:45,593
I'm here to earn a living.

33
00:05:38,804 --> 00:05:40,244
What is he doing?

34
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:47,086
This is Post 26th.
Fishing boat is moving towards the South.

35
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:50,431
We are not sure
if he's going there on purpose.

36
00:05:55,636 --> 00:05:56,876
Help!

37
00:05:57,076 --> 00:05:58,756
Comrade Nam Chul Woo!
Come back!

38
00:05:58,956 --> 00:06:01,076
- What's happening?
- He's over there, commander.

39
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:03,301
He's drifting away.
Shall we catch the boat?

40
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:10,645
You're too late!

41
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:13,189
He's heading towards the border.
Aim the gun.

42
00:06:17,496 --> 00:06:19,496
Shoot him if he passes the border.

43
00:06:23,711 --> 00:06:26,351
- His boat might be broken.
- Shoot him!

44
00:06:26,852 --> 00:06:29,572
A fisherman living in this area
must be aware of the rules.

45
00:06:31,151 --> 00:06:33,031
- Are you sure, commander?
- Yes.

46
00:06:33,856 --> 00:06:36,896
If we shoot him while he's in the
South border, a war might break out.

47
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:38,713
I'll shoot him.

48
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:47,695
Can't he come back if his engine is broken?
His family is here.

49
00:06:56,343 --> 00:06:57,783
Damn it!

50
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:01,531
Let's go to his house.

51
00:07:09,456 --> 00:07:11,256
This is Post 13th,
I'm listening.

52
00:07:11,456 --> 00:07:15,336
There's a boat drifting
50 meters ahead. Check it out.

53
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,276
Yes, sir!

54
00:07:25,457 --> 00:07:26,657
Don't move!

55
00:07:29,338 --> 00:07:30,471
What are you doing here?

56
00:07:31,455 --> 00:07:34,775
- My engine is broken!
- North Korean.

57

58
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,976
Where are you taking me?

59
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:43,136
We are almost in Seoul.

60
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:50,579
Why did you close your eyes?

61
00:08:50,693 --> 00:08:53,253
I can't see anything
until I go back to the North.

62
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,690
Why?

63
00:08:55,488 --> 00:08:59,128
Are you afraid
the police will question you?

64
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:01,209
I belong in the North!

65
00:09:02,556 --> 00:09:06,991
Look, across there. Our tallest
building. Exactly 100 floors.

66
00:09:08,111 --> 00:09:12,111
World's fifth tallest building.

67
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:21,016
Open your eyes.
We are underground.

68
00:09:23,642 --> 00:09:24,711
I didn't see anything.

69
00:09:26,762 --> 00:09:29,082
We know...
Come on, open your eyes.

70
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,851
Empty your pockets, please.

71
00:09:51,136 --> 00:09:52,536
Take a shower.

72
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:54,896
Is it necessary?

73
00:09:55,336 --> 00:09:58,216
You think I'm hiding something?

74
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,096
This is the procedure.

75
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,075
I'm not a spy!

76
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:27,149
- Where are my clothes?
- We got rid of them.

77
00:10:28,976 --> 00:10:30,776
Why the hell would you
throw away my clothes?

78
00:10:30,976 --> 00:10:34,616
We'll give you new clothes.
Your belongigs are in your room.

79
00:10:35,227 --> 00:10:36,907
You didn't even ask me!

80
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:39,911
I'm only following the orders.

81
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:43,152
- Sorry. Wear these.
- Bring my own clothes!

82
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,519
- Wear them, come on.
- Who are you?

83
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:53,811
I'm Agent Jin Woo.
I'm responsible for protecting you.

84
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:56,615
You mean to keep an eye on,
not to protect.

85
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:59,613
Feel free to think that way
but I'm suposed to protect you.

86
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:03,969
I'll be waiting outside.

87
00:11:19,004 --> 00:11:20,324
Is this the guy?

88
00:11:21,135 --> 00:11:22,855
He looks like a spy.

89
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:37,649
Please send me back home.

90
00:11:38,951 --> 00:11:41,911
You must be questioned for not
entering the country legally.

91
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:45,676
Nets got stuck in the engine.

92
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:50,061
- It's not right for you to question me.
- You may think that way.

93
00:11:50,848 --> 00:11:55,909
If I were to enter North Korea,
would they let me off?

94
00:11:56,193 --> 00:11:57,696
But I'm not a spy.

95
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,454
I'll be the one to decide
whether you're a spy or not.

96
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:02,412
What's your name?

97
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:06,331
What's your name?!

98
00:12:08,213 --> 00:12:09,351
Nam Chul Woo.

99
00:12:11,576 --> 00:12:12,776
Your age?

100
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:14,896
I'm 37 years old.

101
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:16,853
Your address?

102
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:19,809
South Hwanghae District,
Bupo Village.

103
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,868
Write down your life.

104
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,270
- Starting with your birth.
- Why?

105
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:29,385
Do what I tell you.

106
00:12:32,616 --> 00:12:35,296
- His engine broke down?
- Yes.

107
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:39,908
Nets got stuck in the engine.

108
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,391
He didn't stop it.

109
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:45,256
We must make sure
he's not here as a spy.

110
00:12:45,968 --> 00:12:49,768
If not, let him stay here.

111
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,866
We can't allow him
to go back to dictatorship.

112
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,220
Come on in.

113
00:13:04,678 --> 00:13:09,218
- In case you want to look outside...
- I can't! Close it!

114
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:14,342
- There's no air inside.
- I said, don't! Close the curtain!

115
00:13:44,514 --> 00:13:48,794
Our leader Kim Jong Un
cried during a martyr funeral.

116
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:51,589
- He said he'll never be forgotten.
- Yes, yes. It's quite said.

117
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,910
Were you able to sleep well?

118
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:14,606
I know you were watching me.

119
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,970
- What would you like to eat?
- I have no money.

120
00:14:20,311 --> 00:14:22,871
You don't have to pay.
Everything is for free.

121
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,890
Choose something from the menu.
What do you think about this one? Alright.

122
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,067
Enjoy.

123
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,890
Eat.
Don't be shy.

124
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:01,152
I'll ask again.

125
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:03,703
Why did the engine got broken?

126
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:08,031
I already told you. Nets got stuck in it.
I wrote it in my statement.

127
00:15:10,531 --> 00:15:12,211
Answer my question.

128
00:15:12,965 --> 00:15:15,731
Please, let me go back home.
I didn't do anything wrong.

129
00:15:17,302 --> 00:15:19,502
You entered the demilitarized zone.

130
00:15:20,693 --> 00:15:22,733
- What were you looking for?
- Bullshit!

131
00:15:23,216 --> 00:15:26,736
The engine is toasted.
It will take a long time to fix it.

132
00:15:28,351 --> 00:15:30,151
Isn't that weird?

133
00:15:30,991 --> 00:15:32,871
Why did you burn the engine?

134
00:15:33,496 --> 00:15:36,256
Because I tried to get rid of the nets
by running the engine.

135
00:15:37,387 --> 00:15:39,231
So that it will take a long time
to get it fixed?

136
00:15:39,256 --> 00:15:42,456
Another spy managed to escape
by using the same tactic.

137
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,276
You look suspicious
under these conditions.

138
00:15:46,802 --> 00:15:48,322
Just let me be.

139
00:16:05,296 --> 00:16:09,096
Are you into sports?
You look fit.

140
00:16:10,096 --> 00:16:11,496
Like everyone else.

141
00:16:11,976 --> 00:16:13,456
Were you in the army?

142
00:16:14,536 --> 00:16:15,816
Where did you serve?

143
00:16:18,336 --> 00:16:21,536
Special Forces?
Come on, tell me.

144
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:27,692
I need to pee.

145
00:16:30,214 --> 00:16:31,574
You can go.

146
00:16:38,485 --> 00:16:39,885
Let me assist you.

147
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:44,145
It's me.

148
00:17:07,656 --> 00:17:09,056
Why did you do that?

149
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:10,776
Don't move!

150
00:17:12,953 --> 00:17:15,633
Son of a bitch!

151
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:18,172
You're screwed.

152
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,172
Cuff him.

153
00:17:25,952 --> 00:17:27,672
You're indeed
from the Special Forces.

154
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:31,632
Confess!
Tell me, now!

155
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:35,592
- I was in the eighth division.
- That's what I thought.

156
00:17:36,072 --> 00:17:38,272
I did my military service.

157
00:17:38,472 --> 00:17:40,512
You don't seem to be
an ordinary soldier.

158
00:17:40,912 --> 00:17:44,192
I can take down five men,
even without a gun.

159
00:17:44,392 --> 00:17:46,352
Are you putting on a show?

160
00:17:47,773 --> 00:17:51,192
Alright, tell me the location of your base
and the names of the commanders.

161
00:17:51,681 --> 00:17:54,401
- That's a private information.
- Son of a bitch!

162
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:58,047
- You're not following the procedure!
- He's a spy!

163
00:17:58,072 --> 00:18:01,912
My job is to protect him.
Perhaps he's not a spy. Don't harm him!

164
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:07,239
He's from the eighth division.
Special Forces. Don't you get it?

165
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,900
It doesn't mean he's a spy!

166
00:18:10,752 --> 00:18:13,712
You're making a mistake, just like
last year's case.

167
00:18:13,952 --> 00:18:18,232
He's no different than Lee Sang Taek.
We're in trouble because of him.

168
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:21,152
- How could you forget?!
- Question him, instead of beating him!

169
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:24,212
Otherwise I will report you.

170
00:18:26,744 --> 00:18:27,864
Alright...

171
00:18:29,222 --> 00:18:31,142
But if he's a spy...

172
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:32,887
...I will kill you.
- Okay.

173
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:36,024
I will quit my job
if he turns out to be a spy.

174
00:18:36,998 --> 00:18:39,638
Alright. We'll see...
Let's move.

175
00:18:44,204 --> 00:18:46,284
You should be ashamed of
what you're doing.

176
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:48,284
I don't need your opinion.

177
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:52,967
So, now...
Write your entire background.

178
00:18:54,687 --> 00:18:56,647
Starting from your birth.

179
00:18:57,871 --> 00:18:59,751
Why do I have to write it down?

180
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:03,491
You lied about the military.
I don't trust you.

181
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:08,404
Write everything about the eighth division.
I want names.

182
00:19:09,174 --> 00:19:10,334
Write it!

183
00:19:24,636 --> 00:19:25,796
Go away.

184
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,080
Get out!

185
00:19:46,776 --> 00:19:48,776
- Put on medicine.
- I don't need it.

186
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,360
- It will get infected.
- I don't give a damn.

187
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,840
Don't worry. It will hurt even more
if it gets infected.

188
00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:02,949
Thank you.

189
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,727
I will lose my job
if I'm mistaken about you.

190
00:20:10,888 --> 00:20:12,648
I swear, I'm not a spy.

191
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:16,966
All I care about is my family.
I have to take care of them.

192
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,370
Rest a little bit.
Tomorrow will be rough.

193
00:20:37,425 --> 00:20:39,745
Things you wrote today
are different than yesterday's.

194
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:43,052
- We have to talk.
- You can continue tomorrow.

195
00:20:44,426 --> 00:20:46,226
The investigator here is me,
not you.

196
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,460
Get up!

197
00:20:53,634 --> 00:20:54,874
Bring him in.

198
00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:15,369
Your questioning will continue
throughout the night.

199
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:20,912
I came here because my boat broke down.

200
00:21:21,832 --> 00:21:23,832
Why do you torture me like this?

201
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:28,124
I'm tired as well.
Just answer my questions.

202
00:21:28,564 --> 00:21:29,844
Without lies.

203
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:38,049
You've mentioned Pyongyang today,
but it wasn't there yesterday.

204
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:40,159
What are you hiding?

205
00:21:40,184 --> 00:21:44,344
I forgot yesterday. Everything I wrote
is the truth. I just remembered today.

206
00:21:46,487 --> 00:21:49,727
Is your memory changing every day?

207
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:55,427
Humans can make such mistakes.

208
00:21:56,186 --> 00:21:58,626
A single sentence can prove
that you're a spy.

209
00:22:01,392 --> 00:22:06,432
I'm not a spy.
I pity you.

210
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:17,943
- Write again.
- I've been writing for four hours!

211
00:22:18,731 --> 00:22:20,091
Never again!

212
00:22:21,346 --> 00:22:22,746
I said, write it.

213
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:26,663
If not, you won't be sleeping tonight.

214
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:47,309
Let him sleep.
You've been hard on him.

215
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:49,749
My job is to question him.

216
00:22:51,148 --> 00:22:52,468
You do your job.

217
00:23:29,356 --> 00:23:31,436
Your father's date of death is different.

218
00:23:32,297 --> 00:23:33,697
When did he die?

219
00:23:34,584 --> 00:23:36,664
- In November or December?
- Enough!

220
00:23:37,356 --> 00:23:41,156
I said, enough!
Let me be, you son of a bitch!

221
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:47,070
I was named the iron fist
of the eighth division!

222
00:23:47,702 --> 00:23:50,102
I can kill a man with a single punch!

223
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,230
- Son of a bitch!
- Stop it! Chul Woo, calm down!

224
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,660
Calm down!

225
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,990
- Please don't!
- Let me go!

226
00:23:58,628 --> 00:24:01,908
I will get out of here!

227
00:24:02,445 --> 00:24:05,805
Let me go!

228
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:09,070
- Let me go!
- Catch the communist!

229
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:14,350
- Let me go! I want to go home!
- Shut up!

230
00:24:15,947 --> 00:24:17,267
Move!

231
00:24:19,729 --> 00:24:21,529
Cuff him!

232
00:24:23,652 --> 00:24:25,492
Let me go.

233
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,200
Don't move.

234
00:24:27,689 --> 00:24:29,049
Get out!

235
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,420
I said get out!

236
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:40,199
Don't.

237
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,370
Iron fist, you said?

238
00:24:55,521 --> 00:24:57,321
Now we're talking.

239
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:02,382
Did they choose you as a spy?

240
00:25:05,092 --> 00:25:06,932
Do you need a spy?

241
00:25:08,852 --> 00:25:11,452
Yes.
Come on, confess.

242
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:17,750
You'd go to jail for a few years
and then train others to be spies.

243
00:25:18,274 --> 00:25:21,194
Here, you can earn enough money.
Why insist on dictatorship?

244
00:25:23,506 --> 00:25:26,506
Will you prefer living in hell instead?

245
00:25:29,746 --> 00:25:31,986
How many spies did you create?

246
00:25:34,007 --> 00:25:36,207
Don't ask questions.
Just answer me.

247
00:25:38,057 --> 00:25:39,897
I'm the one to decide.

248
00:25:41,137 --> 00:25:43,217
You won't get out
if you don't listen to me.

249
00:25:44,657 --> 00:25:47,137
You're the devil.

250
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,580
I will win.

251
00:26:09,585 --> 00:26:10,945
Alright.

252
00:26:12,274 --> 00:26:13,754
Let's wait and see.

253
00:26:15,752 --> 00:26:18,872
- What did you do?
- Don't you dare butt in!

254
00:26:19,973 --> 00:26:21,413
You son of a bitch!

255
00:26:27,501 --> 00:26:28,901
Is he really a spy?

256
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,420
Every single one of them has a potential.
He must be.

257
00:26:33,203 --> 00:26:35,843
Potential?
Tell me the truth.

258
00:26:36,517 --> 00:26:38,117
Did you find any evidence?

259
00:26:38,304 --> 00:26:40,464
Not yet, sir.

260
00:26:41,662 --> 00:26:43,302
Are you gonna torture him?

261
00:26:43,775 --> 00:26:45,455
That's the absolute solution.

262
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:49,746
- First you must find a proof.
- Not unless we force it.

263
00:26:50,857 --> 00:26:52,697
I don't think he's a spy.

264
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:57,510
I heard you were
really tough on the man.

265
00:26:58,051 --> 00:26:59,501
He's just a guard.
What does he know?

266
00:27:00,851 --> 00:27:04,211
Are you acting like this
because of Lee Sang Taek's case?

267
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,030
Are you seeking revenge?

268
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:10,666
Send him to the questioning team.

269
00:27:11,226 --> 00:27:13,466
No.
I'd like to continue.

270
00:27:14,194 --> 00:27:16,074
Catching spies makes me happy.

271
00:27:16,355 --> 00:27:19,635
Catch a real spy,
don't create a fake one.

272
00:27:22,714 --> 00:27:26,834
Did you forget the last one?
People are already on the edge.

273
00:27:27,738 --> 00:27:29,098
Exactly.

274
00:27:30,138 --> 00:27:32,658
Those damn ignorant communists...

275
00:27:33,498 --> 00:27:35,018
Forget about Nam Chul Woo.

276
00:27:36,024 --> 00:27:39,984
Question the North Korean
that came from Vietnam.

277
00:27:40,696 --> 00:27:41,896
What?

278
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,010
I won't write anymore.

279
00:27:54,135 --> 00:27:55,775
I won't.

280
00:27:57,286 --> 00:27:58,566
As you please.

281
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:04,174
Get the hell out of here.

282
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,570
I said, get out, bastard.

283
00:28:12,428 --> 00:28:14,468
- Wait and see.
- See what?

284
00:28:15,316 --> 00:28:17,516
I will get my revenge.

285
00:28:19,788 --> 00:28:23,108
Because I hit you?
How will you get your revenge?

286
00:28:24,699 --> 00:28:26,699
You will see
the day I walk out of this place.

287
00:28:27,631 --> 00:28:28,991
What?

288
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:36,219
Let's go.

289
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,640
Come on in.

290
00:28:52,502 --> 00:28:54,102
Is it done yet?

291
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,450
There's one more step.

292
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,395
Is my boat ready?

293
00:28:59,675 --> 00:29:02,395
- It will take three days.
- Why does it take so long?

294
00:29:02,765 --> 00:29:04,685
My family is in danger!

295
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,420
Alright.
I'll try to help.

296
00:29:40,876 --> 00:29:42,156
Drink it.

297
00:29:44,512 --> 00:29:46,272
You must be exhausted.

298
00:29:47,264 --> 00:29:49,184
I apologize on behalf of everyone.

299
00:29:49,984 --> 00:29:53,744
Our job is no different than
looking for something in the fog.

300
00:29:54,674 --> 00:29:56,954
Can I go back to my country now?

301
00:29:58,253 --> 00:30:00,373
Do you have to go?

302
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:03,947
What do you mean?

303
00:30:04,422 --> 00:30:07,502
We know the conditions
in North Korea are tough.

304
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:12,727
You ended up coming here
after your boat broke down.

305
00:30:13,156 --> 00:30:17,356
Perhaps you should see this
as a chance given to you by God.

306
00:30:19,294 --> 00:30:20,854
Please read this.

307
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,236
<i>Citizenship Proposal</i>

308
00:30:24,076 --> 00:30:26,836
You say that I should defect?

309
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,157
There are many advantages.

310
00:30:31,268 --> 00:30:35,268
You'll have a home,
a job and a good salary.

311
00:30:36,132 --> 00:30:39,892
Then...
Can you bring my family to the South?

312
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:46,066
You can start a new family here.

313
00:30:46,266 --> 00:30:47,906
- If you'd like to marry...
- Look.

314
00:30:48,866 --> 00:30:51,226
Even animals don't leave their flock.

315
00:30:53,237 --> 00:30:55,237
How could humans be this coldhearted?

316
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:58,704
We feel ashamed that
you're forced to live under dictatorship.

317
00:31:00,648 --> 00:31:04,288
Our purpose is to save people
from that regime.

318
00:31:04,888 --> 00:31:08,208
No.
Have you ever been in my country?

319
00:31:09,186 --> 00:31:10,506
You didn't see anything.

320
00:31:10,747 --> 00:31:12,627
How could you know that
we are unhappy?

321
00:31:13,307 --> 00:31:15,027
Because they brainwash all of you...

322
00:31:15,227 --> 00:31:17,347
You don't know
what real freedom feels like.

323
00:31:17,372 --> 00:31:18,652
I haven't been brainwashed!

324
00:31:21,187 --> 00:31:23,707
I didn't have any problems
before coming here.

325
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,680
What can I say...

326
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,120
This is a once in a lifetime chance.
Think about it.

327
00:31:34,386 --> 00:31:35,506
That's enough.

328
00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:41,769
Stop it! Stop playing games!

329
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,940
I'll go back to my country!

330
00:31:47,961 --> 00:31:50,121
He's a stubborn man.

331
00:31:51,611 --> 00:31:55,211
However, we cannot
send him back to dictatorship.

332
00:31:58,278 --> 00:31:59,758
Do you have any other idea?

333
00:32:00,158 --> 00:32:03,438
Should be let him free?

334
00:32:04,604 --> 00:32:06,164
- Free?
- Yes.

335
00:32:06,738 --> 00:32:09,578
Maybe then he would ask for citizenship.

336
00:32:10,941 --> 00:32:14,781
True...
True.

337
00:32:16,638 --> 00:32:17,958
I can't.

338
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:24,525
You have no choice.
It's been decided.

339
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,591
Don't you think it's too cruel?

340
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:32,271
Do we have to take him away
from his family?

341
00:32:36,031 --> 00:32:37,911
Would you be able to
leave your family behind?

342
00:32:38,431 --> 00:32:40,231
I'm not asking for permission.

343
00:32:40,951 --> 00:32:44,511
I only follow the orders.
Listen to my words.

344
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:50,820
Take him out as if you're going somewhere,
and leave him alone.

345
00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:54,138
Act natural.
Understood?

346
00:32:54,955 --> 00:32:56,595
I will take care of the rest.

347
00:33:00,152 --> 00:33:02,352
He'll want to go back to his country.

348
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:07,448
In case he doesn't change his mind,
then we will fail.

349
00:33:08,813 --> 00:33:11,653
Just follow my orders, understood?

350
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:23,502
Comrade, where are you from?

351
00:33:24,286 --> 00:33:27,486
Me?
Hwanghae Province.

352
00:33:29,222 --> 00:33:32,502
I come from the North as well.
My name is Lee Du Chun.

353
00:33:33,123 --> 00:33:35,163
My father was from the North as well.

354
00:33:36,393 --> 00:33:39,193
What are you doing here?

355
00:33:39,913 --> 00:33:42,433
Nice to meet you... However,
I can't talk now.

356
00:33:43,461 --> 00:33:47,301
Can you do me a favor?

357
00:33:50,157 --> 00:33:54,437
My daughter is living in Seoul.
However, I may not be able to see her.

358
00:33:54,927 --> 00:33:57,967
Could you give her a message for me?

359
00:33:58,668 --> 00:34:02,588
I'd like to, but I'll go back.

360
00:34:02,877 --> 00:34:04,637
I can't stay in Seoul any longer.

361
00:34:04,957 --> 00:34:08,757
Then you can ask the other comrades.

362
00:34:09,416 --> 00:34:13,976
Look for Azalea. At the famous
soup restaurant near central station.

363
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,716
Tell her that...

364
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:21,076
"Seven azaleas bloom in May.
Give three to the swallow."

365
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:25,596
"Give two to the deer.
Give last two to the flounder."

366
00:34:25,925 --> 00:34:27,525
Let's move if you're done.

367
00:34:31,186 --> 00:34:32,986
Find Azalea.

368
00:34:40,617 --> 00:34:42,177
Is it done now?

369
00:34:42,577 --> 00:34:45,857
Can I go back to my country
if my boat is fixed?

370
00:34:46,853 --> 00:34:48,373
Yes.

371
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,550
But we have to go somewhere tomorrow.

372
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,710
Are they gonna question me?

373
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:56,510
It has nothing to do with questioning.
Don't worry.

374
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:01,390
Your records are clear.
They will let you go.

375
00:35:05,246 --> 00:35:08,366
Would you like to visit Seoul
before leaving the country?

376
00:35:09,464 --> 00:35:11,144
Yes, but...

377
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:15,622
...I can't.
I shouldn't.

378
00:35:16,494 --> 00:35:19,254
I shouldn't see anything
so that I don't know anything.

379
00:35:20,974 --> 00:35:26,094
I'm afraid of what I wrote down.
The government finds out everything.

380
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:29,124
Will I be in trouble
for talking about the eighth division?

381
00:35:30,739 --> 00:35:35,059
I'm afraid.
I can't look around because of that.

382
00:35:35,803 --> 00:35:37,603
No way.
I can't.

383
00:35:46,989 --> 00:35:49,229
Open the door!
Catch him!

384
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,439
"Seven azaleas bloom in May.
Give three to the swallow."

385
00:35:52,759 --> 00:35:57,159
"Give two to the deer.
Give last two to the flounder."

386
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,839
Come here!

387
00:36:04,088 --> 00:36:05,688
Take him back!

388
00:36:09,217 --> 00:36:12,297
Don't!
He'll kill himself!

389
00:36:13,177 --> 00:36:16,777
- Stop it!
- Stop doing it!

390
00:36:18,531 --> 00:36:20,251
Stop!

391
00:36:29,856 --> 00:36:31,216
He's dead.

392
00:36:32,469 --> 00:36:33,989
Son of a bitch...

393
00:36:34,089 --> 00:36:36,049
What's going on?
Did he commit suicide?

394
00:36:38,038 --> 00:36:39,638
He was a spy.

395
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:42,518
After we found out about what
he's done in China, he wanted to escape.

396
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:46,436
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I will get evidence from China.

397
00:36:46,828 --> 00:36:49,228
I don't want any more troubles.
Hurry up.

398
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:50,961
Yes, sir.

399
00:36:59,044 --> 00:37:01,564
It's cold outside.
Take my hat.

400
00:37:05,815 --> 00:37:07,295
You look nice.

401
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:20,871
Let me know when we go to the city.

402
00:37:22,246 --> 00:37:25,406
Don't be afraid. Open your eyes.
No one will know.

403
00:37:25,966 --> 00:37:27,606
But I will know.

404
00:37:28,105 --> 00:37:30,545
Then my family would be in danger.

405
00:37:30,697 --> 00:37:33,897
I'll keep it a secret.
This is your last chance to see the city.

406
00:37:34,805 --> 00:37:37,805
Do you want me to get in trouble?

407
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:42,129
No. I won't tell anyone
what you saw.

408
00:37:43,103 --> 00:37:48,383
But if I see, I will remember.
If I get questioned, I will tell.

409
00:37:50,183 --> 00:37:52,183
Those agents are scary.

410
00:37:54,218 --> 00:37:59,058
By the way, the man that died...
Was he a spy?

411
00:37:59,698 --> 00:38:02,098
Chinese police proves him
being a spy...

412
00:38:02,298 --> 00:38:03,978
...with hard evidence.

413
00:38:04,879 --> 00:38:08,999
I heard that
people do anything for money in China.

414
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:11,599
How could you know it's not fake?

415
00:39:13,474 --> 00:39:14,834
We can get off.

416
00:39:17,074 --> 00:39:19,834
- Are we inside or outside?
- We're on the street.

417
00:39:20,594 --> 00:39:22,754
Then help me get into some place.

418
00:39:24,951 --> 00:39:26,351
Alright.
Come on.

419
00:40:22,197 --> 00:40:23,677
Are we inside?

420
00:40:24,437 --> 00:40:26,197
Yes, this is it.

421
00:40:26,696 --> 00:40:29,296
It's so crowded.
Take me inside.

422
00:40:31,141 --> 00:40:33,541
- Wait a little bit.
- Don't go, comrade.

423
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,770
Will you leave me here?

424
00:40:36,337 --> 00:40:39,657
Come on.
Open your eyes.

425
00:40:40,867 --> 00:40:43,067
I'll get arrested if I look around.

426
00:40:46,429 --> 00:40:47,949
Do whatever you want, then.

427
00:40:48,053 --> 00:40:50,293
Comrade Jin Woo! Wait!

428
00:40:50,804 --> 00:40:53,444
Comrade Jin Woo! Don't go!

429
00:40:56,115 --> 00:40:57,435
Comrade Jin Woo!

430
00:41:05,228 --> 00:41:06,588
Comrade Jin Woo!

431
00:41:16,465 --> 00:41:17,785
Did you see?

432
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,320
Yes, he's very stubborn.

433
00:41:21,485 --> 00:41:24,005
We must stop.
He can't last any longer.

434
00:41:24,436 --> 00:41:26,556
No.
Continue.

435
00:41:26,725 --> 00:41:29,165
What you're doing is wrong.

436
00:41:32,692 --> 00:41:34,212
I can't continue anymore.

437
00:41:34,652 --> 00:41:36,652
The squad will help him.
Wait a little.

438
00:41:36,852 --> 00:41:39,532
How?
He can't even open his eyes!

439
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,920
Just watch.

440
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:46,455
Where are you going?

441
00:41:47,001 --> 00:41:49,921
- Hold on to me, let me help.
- No, I don't need help.

442
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:52,085
Wait, wait.

443
00:41:52,565 --> 00:41:56,285
Did you see a man with a blue tie?

444
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,280
- A tie?
- Yes, a tie.

445
00:41:58,609 --> 00:42:01,969
Tie?
A blue tie.

446
00:42:03,918 --> 00:42:06,238
- I don't see anyone.
- No?

447
00:42:06,478 --> 00:42:09,878
- I don't see him.
- Where did he go?

448
00:42:12,192 --> 00:42:14,712
Comrade Jin Woo!
Stop hiding!

449
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,390
Come out.

450
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,150
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

451
00:42:29,584 --> 00:42:30,984
Comrade Jin Woo!

452
00:42:33,624 --> 00:42:35,104
- I apologize.
- Comrade Jin Woo!

453
00:42:35,446 --> 00:42:36,926
A thief!
Catch him!

454
00:43:20,507 --> 00:43:23,507
He looks dumbfounded.
He'll get used to it.

455
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:25,621
Hopefully he can manage.

456
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,597
I won't defect!

457
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:36,506
It's enough!
Come out!

458
00:45:39,853 --> 00:45:41,853
Will you let me escape?

459
00:45:50,843 --> 00:45:52,763
Do you rely on this thing?

460
00:46:04,247 --> 00:46:05,887
Don't run away!

461
00:46:53,855 --> 00:46:55,375
We've lost him!

462
00:46:56,295 --> 00:46:58,375
- He played us.
- What?

463
00:46:59,533 --> 00:47:01,093
Don't you get it?

464
00:47:01,493 --> 00:47:03,693
No, he's not a spy.

465
00:47:04,453 --> 00:47:07,733
- Don't be stupid and come back.
- He will come back.

466
00:47:11,006 --> 00:47:14,886
- What's going on?
- We have a problem, sir.

467
00:47:35,967 --> 00:47:39,767
I'm sorry.
Where's the famous soup restaurant?

468
00:47:40,258 --> 00:47:42,018
You'll see after that corner.

469
00:47:42,548 --> 00:47:43,828
Thank you.

470
00:48:06,836 --> 00:48:08,876
Catch her!
Come here!

471
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:12,256
Where the fuck
do you think you're going?

472
00:48:18,573 --> 00:48:19,893
Let me go.

473
00:48:20,302 --> 00:48:23,982
- Did you think you could run?
- Let me go! Help me!

474
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,100
Let the woman go.

475
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,420
Help!
Save me!

476
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:33,780
Who are you?
What are you doing to that woman?

477
00:48:34,614 --> 00:48:36,694
Fuck off.
Mind your business.

478
00:48:54,956 --> 00:48:57,676
- Let's go.
- Take care of your own self.

479
00:49:04,244 --> 00:49:05,604
Put it on.

480
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:07,768
Thank you.

481
00:49:12,445 --> 00:49:13,765
Yes, sir?

482
00:49:13,896 --> 00:49:15,056
Why aren't you coming back?

483
00:49:15,735 --> 00:49:17,375
I will wait for a little while.

484
00:49:17,533 --> 00:49:18,893
He won't come back.

485
00:49:30,397 --> 00:49:31,997
Come on, drink.

486
00:49:33,325 --> 00:49:34,485
Cheers.

487
00:49:42,196 --> 00:49:43,596
Would you like soup?

488
00:49:44,926 --> 00:49:46,326
Yes, please.

489
00:49:48,178 --> 00:49:50,618
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

490
00:50:15,907 --> 00:50:18,187
Is life that hard...

491
00:50:19,781 --> 00:50:21,581
...in a free country?

492
00:50:22,796 --> 00:50:24,156
Free?

493
00:50:26,406 --> 00:50:28,206
That's what you think.

494
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:33,046
I have no money.

495
00:50:34,686 --> 00:50:37,086
I have to sell my body.

496
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,920
They give a house and a job
to all defectors.

497
00:50:48,299 --> 00:50:50,360
Let's get married.

498
00:50:50,385 --> 00:50:52,381
I'll live with you.
I can cook and clean.

499
00:50:52,825 --> 00:50:53,825
Please don't.

500
00:50:54,748 --> 00:50:57,868
We just met.
You don't know me.

501
00:50:58,398 --> 00:50:59,958
I understood you, though.

502
00:51:01,438 --> 00:51:03,518
You're a good man.

503
00:51:07,578 --> 00:51:12,418
I'm sick and tired of living this way.

504
00:51:13,876 --> 00:51:15,156
I want to die.

505
00:51:20,542 --> 00:51:22,422
I should better get going.

506
00:51:26,155 --> 00:51:27,515
Okay.

507
00:51:31,141 --> 00:51:33,541
And I'll go back to my useless life.

508
00:51:35,121 --> 00:51:36,761
Can I use your phone?

509
00:51:44,141 --> 00:51:46,261
Mom, it's me.

510
00:51:47,218 --> 00:51:49,058
Don't worry.
I'm okay.

511
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:53,520
Did you receive the money?
I'll send more.

512
00:51:54,648 --> 00:51:57,928
Let me talk to Min Soo.
Wake her up.

513
00:51:58,732 --> 00:52:00,412
I want to hear her voice.

514
00:52:02,253 --> 00:52:06,493
Min Soo!
Sorry for waking you up.

515
00:52:07,646 --> 00:52:09,086
Were you studying?

516
00:52:09,871 --> 00:52:14,031
You must go to the university now!
You can do it!

517
00:52:16,785 --> 00:52:19,545
Take care of yourself.

518
00:52:25,932 --> 00:52:29,212
Thank you.
I work at the club in the corner.

519
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:30,750
Can you write it on my tab?

520
00:52:32,731 --> 00:52:33,891
Let's go.

521
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:50,670
Thank you.

522
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:56,291
Come to the club
if you want to sleep with me.

523
00:52:57,263 --> 00:52:59,863
I'll make you happy.

524
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:05,558
Wait. Where's the
famous soup restaurant?

525
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:09,798
It's in the corner.
The soup is delicious.

526
00:53:33,318 --> 00:53:36,198
Good evening.
Is this the famous soup restaurant?

527
00:53:37,158 --> 00:53:38,478
Yes.

528
00:53:42,615 --> 00:53:44,175
Is Azalea here?

529
00:53:46,977 --> 00:53:49,497
Azalea!
He's looking for you.

530
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,000
Thank you.

531
00:54:00,501 --> 00:54:02,581
How do you know my father?

532
00:54:04,024 --> 00:54:07,904
We've met recently
but he asked for a favor.

533
00:54:09,561 --> 00:54:12,641
I knew he came to the country.

534
00:54:13,497 --> 00:54:16,977
They must be questioning him now.

535
00:54:19,317 --> 00:54:21,037
Did something happen?

536
00:54:21,827 --> 00:54:26,107
I'm not sure.
I just came to deliver a message.

537
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:29,278
Is he dead?

538
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:34,590
So, he is.

539
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:39,020
Okay.
What's the message?

540
00:54:40,045 --> 00:54:42,725
Your father is dead.
Aren't you sad at all?

541
00:54:43,518 --> 00:54:44,758
I am sad.

542
00:54:45,761 --> 00:54:49,401
However, it doesn't mean
that I have to cry about it.

543
00:54:51,651 --> 00:54:53,171
What did he say?

544
00:54:53,531 --> 00:54:55,491
I don't remember exactly.

545
00:54:57,185 --> 00:54:59,745
Seven azaleas bloom in May.

546
00:55:00,579 --> 00:55:05,059
Give three to the swallow.
Give two to the deer.

547
00:55:06,402 --> 00:55:08,082
Give last two...

548
00:55:08,468 --> 00:55:10,708
- ...to the flounder?
- Exactly.

549
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:14,730
Is it his favourite poem?

550
00:55:18,537 --> 00:55:22,337
Drink your soup.
It's better while it's warm.

551
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,399
Azalea!
Where are you going?

552
00:56:07,595 --> 00:56:09,955
Thank you for believing in me.

553
00:56:18,916 --> 00:56:20,836
Thank you for coming back.

554
00:56:25,977 --> 00:56:27,057
Chief.

555
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,980
Aren't you coming back?

556
00:56:31,474 --> 00:56:33,518
He's here.
Beside me.

557
00:56:35,217 --> 00:56:38,217
- What did you say?
- Send a car.

558
00:56:41,307 --> 00:56:44,987
Comrade... Can I ask you something?

559
00:56:45,477 --> 00:56:46,557
Sure.

560
00:56:47,733 --> 00:56:51,853
I met a girl by chance.
She was very beautiful.

561
00:56:52,985 --> 00:56:56,465
However, she's selling her body
to earn money.

562
00:56:57,325 --> 00:57:00,442
Isn't there any other job
she can do in this country?

563
00:57:01,304 --> 00:57:05,344
I heard her phone call. She's kind,
and takes care of her family.

564
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:08,443
When the light is great,
your shadow grows big.

565
00:57:09,258 --> 00:57:11,578
Freedom does not guarantee happiness.

566
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,600
I saw people throwing away
delicious food.

567
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,400
If they save a little bit...

568
00:57:18,096 --> 00:57:21,016
...everything would be better.
I feel ashamed of this.

569
00:57:22,215 --> 00:57:23,615
Why do you feel ashamed?

570
00:57:23,855 --> 00:57:27,655
The country is fertile.

571
00:57:29,887 --> 00:57:31,767
People are happy.

572
00:57:32,477 --> 00:57:34,517
Everybody has a cellphone.

573
00:57:35,081 --> 00:57:37,321
They eat whatever they like.

574
00:57:39,971 --> 00:57:43,011
Would you like to stay
for these opportunities?

575
00:57:43,036 --> 00:57:44,196
No, I don't want to.

576
00:57:46,325 --> 00:57:48,765
My family is more important
than a luxurious life.

577
00:57:49,681 --> 00:57:51,041
Of course.

578
00:57:52,011 --> 00:57:55,531
I know you're thinking about me.
I can ever repay your kindness.

579
00:57:56,365 --> 00:57:57,685
I'm sorry.

580
00:57:58,165 --> 00:58:01,485
After losing you,
I thought you were a spy.

581
00:58:03,117 --> 00:58:05,357
I was tired of being followed.

582
00:58:06,121 --> 00:58:08,001
That's why I ran away.

583
00:58:08,647 --> 00:58:10,447
My grandfather was born in North Korea.

584
00:58:10,861 --> 00:58:13,181
He missed his land throughout his life.

585
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:17,746
Just like you, he spoke with an accent.

586
00:58:18,653 --> 00:58:21,453
He was also as funny as you.

587
00:58:22,408 --> 00:58:24,768
- I hope you can go back.
- Don't mock me.

588
00:58:28,364 --> 00:58:32,924
I will welcome you in my home
after peace is established.

589
00:58:33,496 --> 00:58:34,896
Alright.
I hope so.

590
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,780
What did you do for three hours?

591
00:58:43,124 --> 00:58:46,924
Is it important?
In the end, I came back, didn't I?

592
00:58:48,586 --> 00:58:51,066
Three hours is a long time to
carry out your mission.

593
00:58:54,825 --> 00:58:56,545
I didn't meet anyone.

594
00:58:56,776 --> 00:58:59,456
Is that so?
What did you do for three hours then?

595
00:59:01,019 --> 00:59:03,899
I met a beautiful woman.

596
00:59:05,025 --> 00:59:06,025
A woman?

597
00:59:06,174 --> 00:59:08,254
Let me take over.

598
00:59:31,573 --> 00:59:33,973
Tell me.
What did you do?

599
00:59:35,453 --> 00:59:37,933
I don't want to speak with you.

600
00:59:38,496 --> 00:59:40,656
Neither do I,
you fucking communist.

601
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:43,944
- Your mouth smells like shit.
- Shut up.

602
00:59:45,852 --> 00:59:47,492
What did you do out there?

603
00:59:48,412 --> 00:59:50,012
Did he meet the spy?

604
00:59:51,052 --> 00:59:54,332
- It seems so.
- No. Then he wouldn't have come back.

605
00:59:55,832 --> 00:59:57,152
True.

606
00:59:58,223 --> 01:00:01,303
Spies don't come here
for a single message.

607
01:00:02,731 --> 01:00:05,131
That's strange.

608
01:00:06,998 --> 01:00:11,118
While you were headed for soup,
you saw gangsters beating a woman.

609
01:00:11,798 --> 01:00:14,878
You helped her out by beating them.
Is that so?

610
01:00:15,442 --> 01:00:16,642
Correct.

611
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:20,556
She asked for your help,
so you stayed with her.

612
01:00:22,432 --> 01:00:24,232
Is that all?

613
01:00:25,144 --> 01:00:26,984
What did you do at the soup place?

614
01:00:32,271 --> 01:00:35,631
You met this girl.
Her codename is Azalea.

615
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,320
Her codename?

616
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:42,798
- Is she a spy?
- What did you do there?

617
01:00:44,212 --> 01:00:47,372
I just had a bowl of soup.

618
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:48,678
What did you two talk about?

619
01:00:49,523 --> 01:00:54,843
- That's none of your business.
- Answer me. What did you talk about?

620
01:00:55,733 --> 01:00:58,253
- I sent her a message.
- From whom?

621
01:00:59,191 --> 01:01:01,191
From the comrade that committed suicide.

622
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:03,071
Was he a spy?
What was the message?

623
01:01:04,256 --> 01:01:06,976
- A poem.
- What poem?

624
01:01:08,526 --> 01:01:11,206
Seven azaleas bloom in May.

625
01:01:13,031 --> 01:01:15,431
Give three to the swallow.

626
01:01:16,451 --> 01:01:20,491
Give two to the deer.
Give last two to the flounder.

627
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,863
- Is it a poem?
- I don't know. I just memorized it.

628
01:01:25,235 --> 01:01:28,795
What are you doing?
Aren't you done questioning me?

629
01:01:33,354 --> 01:01:36,874
What are you doing?
Stop it!

630
01:01:37,289 --> 01:01:40,769
I don't know anything!

631
01:01:41,367 --> 01:01:44,129
I don't know anything!
I swear!

632
01:01:44,838 --> 01:01:45,998
He's a spy.

633
01:01:46,198 --> 01:01:48,758
My investigation is finished!
Let me go!

634
01:01:49,126 --> 01:01:51,366
- I'm not sure.
- I don't know anything!

635
01:01:51,748 --> 01:01:54,348
- Go on with questioning.
- Should I torture him?

636
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:57,278
- Torture?
- As much as necessary, sir.

637
01:01:58,078 --> 01:02:01,798
Let me go!
I'll go back to my country!

638
01:02:03,998 --> 01:02:08,558
You! You would resign
if he turned out to be a spy. Go on.

639
01:02:08,918 --> 01:02:11,158
He didn't know!
They used him!

640
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:16,278
Pull yourself together! Whose side
will you be on in case of a war?

641
01:02:17,104 --> 01:02:18,944
Choose your side!

642
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:45,018
Open the door!
Open the door!

643
01:02:50,585 --> 01:02:52,385
- Chief.
- What is it?

644
01:02:52,726 --> 01:02:55,126
He locked the door
and started beating him.

645
01:02:55,408 --> 01:02:58,768
- He was suspicious.
- He's not a spy. I'm sure of it.

646
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:02,910
If he files a complaint...

647
01:03:03,748 --> 01:03:05,428
...you'll be in trouble as well, sir.

648
01:03:22,735 --> 01:03:24,775
Stand up.

649
01:03:29,734 --> 01:03:30,894
Sit down.

650
01:03:37,085 --> 01:03:38,765
Write down what I say.

651
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:45,028
Start.

652
01:03:46,436 --> 01:03:49,596
"I met spy Lee Du Chun..."

653
01:03:50,129 --> 01:03:52,952
...and I got orders from him."
- That was not an order.

654
01:03:53,902 --> 01:03:55,142
Continue.

655
01:03:56,543 --> 01:04:00,903
"I met Azalea at the famous
soup restaurant and gave her the message."

656
01:04:01,179 --> 01:04:04,379
I'm not a spy.

657
01:04:04,599 --> 01:04:05,839
Stop playing around.

658
01:04:06,661 --> 01:04:09,141
Write down everytihng and sign it.

659
01:04:09,994 --> 01:04:12,914
- I'm not guilty.
- I said, write it down.

660
01:04:16,343 --> 01:04:20,383
If I sign it...

661
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,400
...will I be a spy?

662
01:04:25,134 --> 01:04:28,654
If you write it down and sign it,
I'll send you home.

663
01:04:29,477 --> 01:04:33,557
Will you really send me back to my country?

664
01:04:35,011 --> 01:04:38,411
Yes.
Write and sign it.

665
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:43,808
We fixed your boat.
You'll go back to your family.

666
01:04:45,865 --> 01:04:47,105
Write it.

667
01:04:50,382 --> 01:04:52,542
"I met spy Lee Du Chun..."

668
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:03,560
You've been through a lot.

669
01:05:04,881 --> 01:05:07,761
No, don't sign it.

670
01:05:16,194 --> 01:05:17,434
Come on in.

671
01:05:21,419 --> 01:05:26,259
You are no longer a free man
for threatening our country by being a spy.

672
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:29,090
What does that mean?

673
01:05:29,635 --> 01:05:30,995
You're a spy.

674
01:05:31,325 --> 01:05:33,845
- You can't go anywhere.
- But...

675
01:05:34,823 --> 01:05:36,663
...you promised to send me home.

676
01:05:38,789 --> 01:05:41,349
Wait!
Don't go!

677
01:05:43,719 --> 01:05:46,599
Comrade Jin Woo, I'm not a spy!

678
01:05:46,683 --> 01:05:49,403
I know Chul Woo! Don't worry,
I will save you!

679
01:05:49,691 --> 01:05:52,531
- Is that so? Get out! Take him!
- Let him go!

680
01:05:54,474 --> 01:05:57,234
- Comrade Jin Woo! Comrade Jin Woo!
- Let me go!

681
01:06:00,196 --> 01:06:01,436
What the hell are you doing?

682
01:06:01,836 --> 01:06:04,236
How can you turn an innocent man
into a spy?

683
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,631
He conveyed a message
to another spy.

684
01:06:06,863 --> 01:06:08,463
He confessed it.

685
01:06:08,676 --> 01:06:11,676
You forced him! You know damn well
that he is not a spy!

686
01:06:12,216 --> 01:06:13,576
He's a potential spy.

687
01:06:14,521 --> 01:06:16,521
My job is to catch them.

688
01:06:17,651 --> 01:06:19,011
Bullshit.

689
01:06:19,066 --> 01:06:20,746
Did you forget about
the Cho Sun Cheol case?

690
01:06:21,331 --> 01:06:25,011
After running of resources, he
ran away to China with stolen information.

691
01:06:25,374 --> 01:06:26,974
It's not the same!

692
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:30,620
You will see that
my instincts are correct.

693
01:06:30,801 --> 01:06:33,721
I know you lost your family
during the Korean War.

694
01:06:34,402 --> 01:06:38,522
Then why do you
keep trying to butt in?

695
01:06:39,019 --> 01:06:40,819
This is different.

696
01:06:41,785 --> 01:06:43,465
I beg you.
Let him go.

697
01:06:43,537 --> 01:06:46,337
- What the hell? Go away.
- Let him go back to his country.

698
01:06:46,362 --> 01:06:47,522
Go away!

699
01:06:53,362 --> 01:06:55,282
As far as I understand...

700
01:06:55,722 --> 01:06:58,802
...you insist on
making him a spy by force.

701
01:07:00,977 --> 01:07:03,577
I caught him like a mad dog.
What do you mean to say?

702
01:07:03,777 --> 01:07:06,777
You're the one acting like a mad dog.

703
01:07:08,143 --> 01:07:10,623
We can't call him a spy
because of a simple message.

704
01:07:10,861 --> 01:07:12,741
Am I wrong?

705
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:19,328
We lost everything because of that message.
All the spies are hiding.

706
01:07:20,351 --> 01:07:23,551
It doesn't mean
you have to brand him a spy.

707
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:26,311
So, will he be free?

708
01:07:26,711 --> 01:07:27,951
Of course not.

709
01:07:29,551 --> 01:07:34,351
Convince him to
accept the citizenship proposal.

710
01:07:38,053 --> 01:07:41,813
Will you give him a salary
so that he continue being a spy?

711
01:07:43,516 --> 01:07:46,156
Think about your country
and your future first.

712
01:07:46,459 --> 01:07:50,459
- Not about taking your family's revenge!
- Who said it was about revenge?!

713
01:07:54,008 --> 01:07:55,288
Dumbasses.

714
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:06,067
Listen to me carefully.

715
01:08:07,811 --> 01:08:11,211
As of now, you're a spy.

716
01:08:12,921 --> 01:08:17,001
You will be prosecuted
and be punished accordingly.

717
01:08:17,411 --> 01:08:19,011
What you're doing is injustice.

718
01:08:20,968 --> 01:08:23,488
What did I do to deserve it?

719
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:29,451
- I'm innocent.
- There's one way out.

720
01:08:30,178 --> 01:08:32,058
Should I defect?

721
01:08:33,278 --> 01:08:34,478
Yes.

722
01:08:35,224 --> 01:08:37,064
So, I should betray my land...

723
01:08:38,376 --> 01:08:41,376
...and forget about my family?

724
01:08:42,586 --> 01:08:45,466
You must decide until tomorrow.

725
01:08:46,695 --> 01:08:48,615
I don't need to think.

726
01:08:50,589 --> 01:08:52,349
The answer is simple.

727
01:08:52,975 --> 01:08:54,455
What do you mean?

728
01:08:54,906 --> 01:08:56,786
I want to know one thing.

729
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:02,204
If I don't defect...

730
01:09:03,771 --> 01:09:06,131
...can't I go back to my life?

731
01:09:16,107 --> 01:09:18,307
I have one last wish.

732
01:09:21,145 --> 01:09:23,065
I'd like to talk to Jin Woo.

733
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:39,119
In my country...

734
01:09:39,919 --> 01:09:42,559
...I caught many fish in the river.

735
01:09:45,753 --> 01:09:49,873
- And now the net is around my own neck.
- Don't give up.

736
01:09:51,749 --> 01:09:54,069
Once the fish is caught on the net,
its life is over.

737
01:09:56,675 --> 01:09:58,515
I'd like to thank you.

738
01:10:00,455 --> 01:10:01,975
What do you mean?

739
01:10:04,639 --> 01:10:05,999
Chul Woo.

740
01:10:07,589 --> 01:10:08,909
Chul Woo.

741
01:10:34,051 --> 01:10:35,451
I have a bad feeling.

742
01:10:36,018 --> 01:10:39,058
- What happened?
- Chul Woo is saying goodbye.

743
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:42,710
Does he wish to die?

744
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:45,750
He would do anything to protect his family.

745
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:49,430
People don't die that easily.
Keep an eye on him.

746
01:11:31,151 --> 01:11:32,551
What is it?

747
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:35,111
- Move! Move!
- What are you doing?

748
01:11:36,151 --> 01:11:38,471
- Where is the key?
- Dedective has it.

749
01:11:38,671 --> 01:11:39,911
He's gonna kill himself!

750
01:11:40,906 --> 01:11:42,906
What?

751
01:11:45,962 --> 01:11:47,602
What is he doing?
Open the door!

752
01:11:50,076 --> 01:11:52,556
Help me!

753
01:11:53,276 --> 01:11:54,836
Chul Woo!

754
01:11:54,861 --> 01:11:56,301
Chul Woo!

755
01:11:57,396 --> 01:12:00,036
Let's save him! Chul Woo!
Please stop!

756
01:12:24,191 --> 01:12:26,231
Stupid men.
When they're in danger...

757
01:12:26,505 --> 01:12:28,785
...they want to bite off
their tongues and escape.

758
01:12:29,418 --> 01:12:31,258
How can you say that?

759
01:12:33,961 --> 01:12:35,521
You're not a human!

760
01:12:36,858 --> 01:12:38,378
You little prick.

761
01:12:38,837 --> 01:12:41,237
You planned it, didn't you?

762
01:12:50,904 --> 01:12:52,824
- What's going on?
- I apologize.

763
01:12:53,504 --> 01:12:54,904
He's alright now.

764
01:12:55,624 --> 01:12:59,264
You pushed him too far.
What if he managed to die?

765
01:13:00,169 --> 01:13:03,689
We are surrounded by reporters
since the last case, don't you know it?

766
01:13:03,714 --> 01:13:07,674
- He's a potential spy.
- That's enough! Stop it!

767
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:17,867
Sir, they are aware of his day in Seoul.

768
01:13:19,552 --> 01:13:21,112
They asked for the footage.

769
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:25,140
No way. If the North finds out,
they won't let him live.

770
01:13:26,534 --> 01:13:28,534
Don't let him go back.

771
01:13:29,469 --> 01:13:31,269
Why are you so cruel?

772
01:13:31,743 --> 01:13:33,023
What are you saying?

773
01:13:33,669 --> 01:13:36,149
Everything will be worse
if he goes back.

774
01:13:36,911 --> 01:13:38,751
Did you forget about our purpose?

775
01:13:39,031 --> 01:13:42,431
We are trying to save
more and more people from the dictatorship.

776
01:13:44,529 --> 01:13:47,129
However, we must respect their choices.

777
01:13:47,864 --> 01:13:49,104
Respect?

778
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:53,970
They're all brainwashed.
Why should we show them respect?

779
01:13:56,851 --> 01:13:58,651
But...

780
01:13:58,983 --> 01:14:02,343
...I'm suffering as well.
Don't you know it?

781
01:14:04,033 --> 01:14:06,873
As long as I obtain this position...

782
01:14:07,149 --> 01:14:09,909
...I'll keep helping people.

783
01:14:11,355 --> 01:14:14,835
You shoul help us as well.

784
01:14:16,227 --> 01:14:19,067
- Hand over the footage. Come on.
- No way!

785
01:14:19,707 --> 01:14:22,307
You disrespectful boy!

786
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:27,363
Don't you dare raise your voice!
Get out! Go!

787
01:14:39,617 --> 01:14:43,617
Seoul Trip of the
North Korean Fisherman

788
01:14:46,962 --> 01:14:50,082
Are they broadcasting this in the North?

789
01:14:50,603 --> 01:14:53,403
You'll be questioned if you go back.

790
01:14:56,368 --> 01:14:59,848
North Korea is answering
with a new footage.

791
01:15:02,839 --> 01:15:04,279
Don't.

792
01:15:05,197 --> 01:15:09,746
Chul Woo has been a faithful husband.

793
01:15:13,349 --> 01:15:17,429
My husband would never
leave his country.

794
01:15:18,028 --> 01:15:22,588
He's sincerely devoded
to his country and his family.

795
01:15:23,105 --> 01:15:27,185
He won't be fooled
by the capitalist games...

796
01:15:29,022 --> 01:15:34,254
He would never betray
his country or family.

797
01:15:36,962 --> 01:15:40,242
Chul Woo, when you come back...

798
01:15:40,391 --> 01:15:44,191
...the government promised
not to accuse you. Our daughter...

799
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:48,751
What happened Chul Woo?
Come back...

800
01:15:49,901 --> 01:15:51,941
Sul is waiting for you.

801
01:15:52,569 --> 01:15:54,769
Come back to your revolutionist land.

802
01:15:57,326 --> 01:16:01,566
Please come back.

803
01:16:04,474 --> 01:16:08,154
This is a message
to the South Korean officials.

804
01:16:09,256 --> 01:16:12,976
Our people can't disregard their tears.

805
01:16:14,576 --> 01:16:17,456
Let go of our fisherman brother.

806
01:16:18,153 --> 01:16:21,513
Stop playing your
anti-communism games at once.

807
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:25,160
Nam Chul Woo was dragged to
the Southern border...

808
01:16:25,185 --> 01:16:27,465
...because his boat broke down.

809
01:16:28,466 --> 01:16:33,386
Regardless of his innocence,
he was arrested and tortured.

810
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:36,280
You are looking for
an excuse to start a war.

811
01:16:36,488 --> 01:16:39,448
Your capitalist methods won't work.

812
01:16:39,743 --> 01:16:41,703
Our nation is bound to conquer.

813
01:16:46,987 --> 01:16:48,107
Congratulations.

814
01:16:49,731 --> 01:16:52,971
We will send you back to North Korea.

815
01:16:53,616 --> 01:16:54,936
I can't...

816
01:16:56,549 --> 01:16:58,869
...thank you for that.

817
01:17:00,011 --> 01:17:04,491
There are still many things
we don't know about you.

818
01:17:05,618 --> 01:17:06,858
So wht?

819
01:17:08,256 --> 01:17:12,176
The only reason you're going back
is because of your family...

820
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:14,630
...not because of dictatorship.

821
01:17:15,996 --> 01:17:21,716
Isn't that so? North Korea is
testing their nuclear missiles.

822
01:17:23,193 --> 01:17:26,073
The future of your country is in danger.

823
01:17:27,483 --> 01:17:32,323
The result can harm the entire Korean land.

824
01:17:34,155 --> 01:17:38,595
We'd like you to help us,
once you're back to your country.

825
01:17:40,065 --> 01:17:43,031
Think carefully.
There are secret bases where you live.

826
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,840
Are you asking me to be a spy?

827
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,640
What we can call it is...

828
01:17:50,734 --> 01:17:54,095
...that we need your help for peace.
You can be a hero.

829
01:17:54,501 --> 01:17:56,461
Stop talking.

830
01:18:08,614 --> 01:18:12,374
You received many presents
from Korean associations.

831
01:18:14,214 --> 01:18:16,174
I don't need any of these.

832
01:18:17,242 --> 01:18:20,082
All of them are for you.
Take anything you like.

833
01:18:20,882 --> 01:18:23,002
It would be better if you take them.

834
01:19:11,805 --> 01:19:13,245
Were you able to sleep?

835
01:19:17,405 --> 01:19:19,605
I sold the gifts and got you dollars.

836
01:19:21,241 --> 01:19:23,201
You can survive
for a long time with this money.

837
01:19:26,597 --> 01:19:28,197
Try not to get caught.

838
01:19:28,586 --> 01:19:30,106
Hide it well.

839
01:19:34,757 --> 01:19:37,957
Take it.
You can give it to your daughter.

840
01:19:54,233 --> 01:19:55,513
Jin Woo.

841
01:19:57,164 --> 01:19:58,404
Move!

842
01:20:04,022 --> 01:20:06,062
I heard you were going back to hell.

843
01:20:06,941 --> 01:20:09,261
- I pity you.
- What?

844
01:20:10,093 --> 01:20:12,573
- Let's get out of here.
- You owe me an apology.

845
01:20:13,717 --> 01:20:17,397
Lucky you. The only reason you're free
is because we don't have evidence.

846
01:20:17,916 --> 01:20:20,396
You're a twat with inferiority complex.

847
01:20:21,644 --> 01:20:25,404
Peace cannot be established
because of stupid men like you!

848
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:29,295
Stop ruining everything.

849
01:20:30,765 --> 01:20:32,325
Son of a bitch.

850
01:20:33,125 --> 01:20:36,805
Come on, hit me.
Think you will win then?

851
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:40,180
- You're not even worth hitting.
- Get the hell out.

852
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:42,785
Calm down.
Let's go.

853
01:20:44,144 --> 01:20:46,024
You're right, let's go.

854
01:20:46,865 --> 01:20:49,745
He's not even human.
He's not worth it.

855
01:20:50,953 --> 01:20:52,473
Wait now!

856
01:21:08,049 --> 01:21:10,409
You can't live like that.
Don't you understand?

857
01:21:20,551 --> 01:21:22,031
Son of a bitch.

858
01:21:22,907 --> 01:21:24,627
That man is definitely a spy!

859
01:21:24,827 --> 01:21:28,267
I won't let him
complete his mission!

860
01:21:28,292 --> 01:21:29,418
<i>Fake Spy Mission
at National Security</i>

861
01:21:29,442 --> 01:21:32,362
Explain this!
We didn't release such information!

862
01:21:33,549 --> 01:21:35,589
Those Chinese documents were fake.

863
01:21:37,523 --> 01:21:39,363
I will be questioned because of you!

864
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:44,308
What the hell was I supposed to do?
Tell me, what should I have done?

865
01:21:46,339 --> 01:21:50,179
<i>Until we protect our seas
and the Paektu Mountain</i>

866
01:21:50,542 --> 01:21:53,702
<i>God bless our nation</i>

867
01:21:54,554 --> 01:21:58,314
<i>The land of flowered mountains</i>

868
01:21:58,849 --> 01:22:02,474
<i>People of Great Korea</i>

869
01:22:03,101 --> 01:22:04,941
<i>They will always be honest</i>

870
01:22:05,141 --> 01:22:06,277
<i>We will always be honest</i>

871
01:22:06,377 --> 01:22:07,377
Enough!

872
01:22:08,596 --> 01:22:14,556
<i>Until we protect our seas
and the Paektu Mountain</i>

873
01:22:15,179 --> 01:22:21,139
<i>God bless our nation</i>

874
01:22:26,347 --> 01:22:27,707
Stop here.

875
01:23:49,311 --> 01:23:51,871
Democratic People's Republic of Korea!

876
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:53,671
Live long!

877
01:23:54,443 --> 01:23:56,323
Live long!

878
01:23:56,799 --> 01:23:58,839
Live long!

879
01:24:24,545 --> 01:24:26,505
Welcome Home Comrade Nam Chul Woo

880
01:24:32,085 --> 01:24:34,525
Democratic People's Republic of Korea!

881
01:24:34,833 --> 01:24:36,193
Live long!

882
01:24:36,285 --> 01:24:37,365
Live long!

883
01:24:37,742 --> 01:24:39,262
Live long!

884
01:24:45,456 --> 01:24:47,096
Welcome back to your land.

885
01:24:55,253 --> 01:24:56,573
Follow me.

886
01:25:01,929 --> 01:25:04,009
We congratulate you
on your return.

887
01:25:20,297 --> 01:25:23,057
Is my family safe?

888
01:25:23,583 --> 01:25:26,783
Why? Did you do something wrong
in South Korea?

889
01:25:26,983 --> 01:25:28,463
Of course, not.

890
01:25:29,202 --> 01:25:31,242
Then why are you afraid?

891
01:25:58,926 --> 01:26:00,983
Sul, your father's back.

892
01:26:04,078 --> 01:26:05,598
Are you happy?

893
01:26:20,656 --> 01:26:23,056
The soldiers took your husband
to the station.

894
01:26:42,892 --> 01:26:44,172
Go downstairs.

895
01:26:51,642 --> 01:26:52,762
He's here, sir.

896
01:26:53,028 --> 01:26:54,708
- Wait outside.
- Yes sir.

897
01:26:58,513 --> 01:26:59,713
Inspect him.

898
01:27:03,858 --> 01:27:05,418
Turn.

899
01:27:12,472 --> 01:27:15,152
- He's clean, sir.
- Give him clothes.

900
01:27:16,770 --> 01:27:19,490
Answer my questions properly.

901
01:27:20,139 --> 01:27:21,539
Yes, sir.

902
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,560
- Do you know how to swim?
- Yes, sir.

903
01:27:23,976 --> 01:27:26,576
- How far can you swim?
- At least three kilometers.

904
01:27:27,271 --> 01:27:30,071
Then why didn't you jump out
of the boat to come back?

905
01:27:32,357 --> 01:27:36,477
The boat is the only thing I have.
It took me 10 years to buy it.

906
01:27:37,099 --> 01:27:42,019
Is your boat more important
than your country?

907
01:27:43,195 --> 01:27:46,115
- Don't you trust your country?
- I believe it, sir!

908
01:27:50,123 --> 01:27:53,452
Start writing about everything
you experienced in South Korea.

909
01:27:54,408 --> 01:27:56,488
Including the food you ate.

910
01:27:59,963 --> 01:28:02,083
- Are you hesitating?
- No, sir.

911
01:28:03,603 --> 01:28:06,803
Then write every single detail.

912
01:28:19,715 --> 01:28:21,075
What happened?

913
01:28:21,606 --> 01:28:23,566
No progress yet.

914
01:28:23,797 --> 01:28:27,917
Try to find a mistake of South Korea.
Find something.

915
01:28:28,991 --> 01:28:30,111
Yes, sir.

916
01:28:37,096 --> 01:28:40,256
- Is everything true?
- Everything's true, sir.

917
01:28:41,093 --> 01:28:44,733
- I closed my eyes but there...
- Just answer my questions.

918
01:28:50,205 --> 01:28:53,285
There are some things wrong here.

919
01:28:54,742 --> 01:28:56,502
Write again.

920
01:28:59,504 --> 01:29:02,647
- What?
- Are you deaf?

921
01:29:03,093 --> 01:29:04,613
I said, write again.

922
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:08,660
Don't miss any detail.

923
01:29:09,672 --> 01:29:13,632
We have many unknown spies
in South Korean intelligent service.

924
01:29:14,753 --> 01:29:17,513
We know exactly
what you've done there.

925
01:29:18,314 --> 01:29:21,834
Then why do you need me to write it down?

926
01:29:23,322 --> 01:29:24,642
What did you say?

927
01:29:25,146 --> 01:29:28,186
You will do exactly
what I tell you to do!

928
01:29:30,727 --> 01:29:35,287
Just a visit in the South and now
you think you're an emperor?

929
01:29:40,286 --> 01:29:41,606
Start writing!

930
01:29:53,593 --> 01:29:57,593
- Why did you left out your trip in Seoul?
- I was not on a trip.

931
01:29:58,608 --> 01:30:02,448
- I got lost on the streets.
- Do you take us for a fool?

932
01:30:16,541 --> 01:30:19,541
You were obviously
mesmerised by the Southern things.

933
01:30:20,661 --> 01:30:23,261
I've never seen them before.

934
01:30:23,926 --> 01:30:27,766
I see. You were surprised.
We all know that.

935
01:30:30,185 --> 01:30:34,945
However, if you didn't have a family here,
you'd prefer staying there.

936
01:30:36,183 --> 01:30:37,823
- Is that correct?
- No, sir!

937
01:30:38,494 --> 01:30:40,814
Our great leader, Kim Jong Il!

938
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,200
Live long!
Live long!

939
01:30:44,871 --> 01:30:47,391
- Live long!
- That's enough.

940
01:30:49,438 --> 01:30:51,878
Write everything from scratch.

941
01:30:56,431 --> 01:30:59,920
I wonder if you were offered to be a spy...

942
01:31:01,138 --> 01:31:02,978
Yes, but I refused it.

943
01:31:03,614 --> 01:31:06,414
- Seriously?
- I would never betray my country!

944
01:31:07,104 --> 01:31:08,784
Then why did you...

945
01:31:09,603 --> 01:31:11,963
...tell them about your military service?
- I'm sorry.

946
01:31:12,466 --> 01:31:15,466
I wrote the division and names wrong
on purpose.

947
01:31:16,106 --> 01:31:19,266
- Can I trust you?
- My family lives here.

948
01:31:19,683 --> 01:31:22,563
I'm not a traitor!
Please believe me!

949
01:31:25,684 --> 01:31:27,724
Alright.

950
01:31:28,654 --> 01:31:30,214
I will believe you.

951
01:31:36,235 --> 01:31:39,235
- What's this?
- They found it on the boat.

952
01:31:41,036 --> 01:31:44,876
- Is that so?
- The engine was also brand new.

953
01:31:45,877 --> 01:31:47,117
Really?

954
01:32:02,429 --> 01:32:03,429
What's this?

955
01:32:05,496 --> 01:32:07,536
A gift for my daughter, sir.

956
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:09,720
A gift?

957
01:32:10,812 --> 01:32:12,932
Did you go there on a vacation?

958
01:32:15,853 --> 01:32:17,653
Stand up.

959
01:32:20,559 --> 01:32:21,799
Face the wall.

960
01:32:22,439 --> 01:32:25,119
I'm sorry. My daughter's
doll was worn out.

961
01:32:26,457 --> 01:32:28,257
Stop lying!

962
01:32:28,683 --> 01:32:31,563
Why did you bring the toy?
You traitor!

963
01:32:33,444 --> 01:32:36,564
Why the fuck did you bring the toy?

964
01:32:36,817 --> 01:32:41,057
Why?! Answer me!
You son of a bitch!

965
01:32:42,870 --> 01:32:47,710
My problem is not the toy!
The problem is your ideas!

966
01:32:48,638 --> 01:32:50,518
Why the fuck did you get a new engine?

967
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:52,450
What else did you bring?

968
01:32:54,855 --> 01:32:59,055
- Answer me. What else did you bring?
- I didn't bring anything else.

969
01:33:04,990 --> 01:33:06,230
Stand up.

970
01:33:13,383 --> 01:33:14,663
Sit.

971
01:33:27,229 --> 01:33:28,709
What's this, sir?

972
01:33:28,909 --> 01:33:33,189
For the evening news.
We will take his picture.

973
01:33:39,393 --> 01:33:40,873
Stand up.

974
01:33:49,521 --> 01:33:51,561
Now smile, proudly.

975
01:33:55,413 --> 01:33:59,293
You should smile more.
The entire country will see you.

976
01:33:59,903 --> 01:34:03,783
Come on, show your teeth.

977
01:34:05,745 --> 01:34:08,545
- There we go. Good.
- That's how you should pose.

978
01:34:11,054 --> 01:34:13,574
You should smile more.

979
01:34:18,806 --> 01:34:22,206
The photographer was beautiful.
Did you see her?

980
01:34:24,646 --> 01:34:26,566
Continue writing.

981
01:34:27,279 --> 01:34:29,519
Why do I have to write?

982
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:31,940
Did you say something?

983
01:34:32,376 --> 01:34:36,096
I got drifted there
because my engine broke.

984
01:34:37,606 --> 01:34:39,606
I don't have to write it down.

985
01:34:40,566 --> 01:34:44,246
I had closed my eyes,
but they fooled me, sir.

986
01:34:45,342 --> 01:34:47,022
You're a traitor.

987
01:34:50,330 --> 01:34:52,330
So, you don't want to write it.

988
01:34:54,259 --> 01:34:57,059
Then you won't see your family.

989
01:34:59,682 --> 01:35:04,002
I will write it, sir.
My family is waiting for me.

990
01:35:04,850 --> 01:35:07,090
I will write it a thousand times,
if necessary.

991
01:35:09,592 --> 01:35:12,952
I'm simply a fisherman.
I am not different than the others.

992
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:26,840
Are you ill?

993
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:29,640
Did they torture you?

994
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:33,250
No, sir.
I have stomach pain.

995
01:35:33,535 --> 01:35:34,935
Then go to the toilet.

996
01:35:35,273 --> 01:35:37,713
No.
I'm okay.

997
01:35:41,617 --> 01:35:44,337
Did you starve to save our country?

998
01:35:53,803 --> 01:35:55,403
It's me.

999
01:35:56,495 --> 01:35:58,415
Send some food downstairs.

1000
01:36:02,248 --> 01:36:04,168
It's my treat.

1001
01:36:08,139 --> 01:36:09,499
Eat it.

1002
01:36:11,259 --> 01:36:14,899
- I'm not hungry.
- You don't have to be shy. Eat.

1003
01:36:16,952 --> 01:36:18,234
I don't want to.

1004
01:36:18,558 --> 01:36:20,558
Did you eat a lot in South Korea?

1005
01:36:21,291 --> 01:36:22,891
That's not the reason.

1006
01:36:23,312 --> 01:36:25,592
Then eat.

1007
01:36:27,534 --> 01:36:28,694
Here.

1008
01:36:35,917 --> 01:36:40,717
When can I go back home?

1009
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:44,210
I miss my family.

1010
01:36:44,970 --> 01:36:48,970
If you write everything correctly,
you can go back in the morning.

1011
01:36:49,754 --> 01:36:51,394
Really?

1012
01:36:52,491 --> 01:36:53,931
Eat well.

1013
01:37:05,402 --> 01:37:06,842
Eat this one, too.

1014
01:37:19,769 --> 01:37:22,569
What happened?
Did you get nauseous?

1015
01:37:24,125 --> 01:37:25,965
Go to the toilet.

1016
01:37:26,999 --> 01:37:29,319
You don't have to hold it.

1017
01:37:37,434 --> 01:37:40,514
- Take him to the toiler.
- Yes, sir.

1018
01:38:06,937 --> 01:38:09,497
What's in your hand?
Show it to me.

1019
01:38:19,952 --> 01:38:22,112
Why did you
put your hand in the hole?

1020
01:38:23,358 --> 01:38:25,038
There was no toilet paper.

1021
01:38:26,069 --> 01:38:27,509
Check it.

1022
01:38:37,468 --> 01:38:39,148
I found it, sir.

1023
01:38:41,047 --> 01:38:42,407
What's this?

1024
01:38:46,567 --> 01:38:47,847
Don't move!

1025
01:38:50,886 --> 01:38:52,046
Stand up!

1026
01:38:53,895 --> 01:38:55,335
Forgive me!

1027
01:39:01,855 --> 01:39:03,455
So, you brought dollars.

1028
01:39:13,011 --> 01:39:14,971
You will continue to write.

1029
01:39:17,665 --> 01:39:18,705
Move.

1030
01:39:23,406 --> 01:39:26,366
Did you sleep with a South Korean girl?

1031
01:39:27,686 --> 01:39:28,886
No, sir.

1032
01:39:29,166 --> 01:39:31,526
I just helped her out.

1033
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:34,340
You could've fucked her.

1034
01:39:35,567 --> 01:39:37,927
- Why didn't you?
- I couldn't.

1035
01:39:40,212 --> 01:39:41,612
Alright.

1036
01:39:42,665 --> 01:39:45,305
How many men
can resist a woman like her?

1037
01:39:46,322 --> 01:39:47,562
I understand.

1038
01:39:48,516 --> 01:39:52,996
They set you up and
offered you citizenship.

1039
01:39:58,492 --> 01:40:03,532
After all, you have ideological problems.

1040
01:40:05,213 --> 01:40:07,933
However, the fact that you returned
to your land is sublime.

1041
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:11,050
I will let you go.

1042
01:40:11,432 --> 01:40:12,912
Are you serious, sir?

1043
01:40:18,109 --> 01:40:20,029
Yes.

1044
01:40:25,446 --> 01:40:29,006
You haven't seen the money.

1045
01:40:30,523 --> 01:40:31,763
Understood?

1046
01:40:32,672 --> 01:40:34,352
Keep it as a secret.

1047
01:40:36,369 --> 01:40:39,089
In return, I will keep...

1048
01:40:39,481 --> 01:40:41,201
...the things you've done there.

1049
01:40:41,696 --> 01:40:43,256
Understood?

1050
01:40:57,617 --> 01:40:59,417
Say hi to your little girl.

1051
01:41:56,514 --> 01:42:01,154
Welcome Home
Comrade Nam Chul Woo

1052
01:42:23,355 --> 01:42:25,795
Comrade, welcome home.

1053
01:43:23,096 --> 01:43:24,936
Did they question you?

1054
01:43:27,045 --> 01:43:28,365
No.

1055
01:43:28,577 --> 01:43:29,857
I'll bring water.

1056
01:43:41,751 --> 01:43:43,951
Dad!
Can you fix it?

1057
01:44:02,447 --> 01:44:04,687
Great Leader

1058
01:45:48,602 --> 01:45:50,762
Comrade.
Why are you here?

1059
01:45:51,882 --> 01:45:54,282
I have to cast a net.

1060
01:45:54,897 --> 01:45:58,297
No way.
You're forbidden from fishing.

1061
01:46:02,331 --> 01:46:05,171
Do other things.
You're till healthy.

1062
01:46:12,289 --> 01:46:14,729
I can't live without fishing.

1063
01:46:15,848 --> 01:46:17,928
- Wait, you can't go.
- Move!

1064
01:46:18,441 --> 01:46:20,201
What are you doing?
Wait!

1065
01:46:21,792 --> 01:46:23,352
I came back to the country!

1066
01:46:23,574 --> 01:46:25,494
- I want to work!
- Shut up!

1067
01:46:26,086 --> 01:46:29,096
You can't go into the river!
I got strict orders!

1068
01:46:29,764 --> 01:46:31,924
We're keep an eye on you!

1069
01:46:32,417 --> 01:46:34,497
No!
I will go!

1070
01:46:34,697 --> 01:46:36,457
- Don't move!
- Get out of my way!

1071
01:46:37,617 --> 01:46:38,737
Stop!

1072
01:46:39,697 --> 01:46:41,737
Are you disobeying my orders?

1073
01:46:45,947 --> 01:46:47,627
Go ahead, shoot me!

1074
01:46:48,387 --> 01:46:50,707
I suffered enough!

1075
01:46:57,024 --> 01:47:00,224
This is Post 26th. Comrade Nam
is insisting on going into the river.

1076
01:47:04,929 --> 01:47:06,129
Yes, sir.

1077
01:47:08,010 --> 01:47:11,170
I got ordered to shoot you!
Don't move!

1078
01:47:14,761 --> 01:47:18,961
Do whatever you want!
I have to catch fish!

1079
01:47:20,218 --> 01:47:25,258
That's the only way I can take care
of my family. You can't stop me!

1080
01:47:28,151 --> 01:47:33,151
Stop messing with me already!

1081
01:48:00,058 --> 01:48:04,058
We warned him enough.
Shoot, if he continues.

1082
01:48:05,305 --> 01:49:05,442

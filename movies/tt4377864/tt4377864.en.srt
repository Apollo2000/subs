THE PEARL BUTTON

3
00:00:58,935 --> 00:01:03,815
"we are all streams
from one water"

4
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:43,957
This block of quartz
was found

5
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:47,168
in the Atacama desert,
in Chile.

6
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,800
It is 3,000 years old

7
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:57,095
and contains a
drop of water.

8
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:40,638
The Chilean desert

9
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:43,766
is the driest
place on Earth.

10
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:45,852
From here,

11
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,855
astronomers discovered water

12
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:51,357
in almost the entire cosmos.

13
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:56,821
There's water
in the planets.

14
00:03:57,572 --> 00:04:00,909
There's water vapor
in some nebula.

15
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:05,872
There's ice in other
celestial bodies.

16
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,793
On earth, and elsewhere,

17
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:14,881
water is essential
for life to exist.

18
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:18,843
Each night

19
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:20,929
a new planet is discovered,

20
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:23,765
that might have water.

21
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:42,802
As I watched the stars,

22
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:46,180
I was drawn to the
importance of water.

23
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:51,686
It seems that water
came from outer space,

24
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:54,439
and life was brought to
earth by the comets,

25
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:57,608
that shaped the seas.

26
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:06,075
Water,

27
00:06:06,284 --> 00:06:09,287
Chile's longest border,

28
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:15,001
forms an estuary known
as Western Patagonia.

29
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:17,670
Here,

30
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,882
the Cordillera of the Andes
sinks into the water

31
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,510
and re-emerges as
thousands of islands.

32
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:28,556
It's a timeless place.

33
00:06:28,765 --> 00:06:31,351
An archipelago of rain.

34
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:58,229
Some distant relatives
of mine lived here.

35
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:01,941
We had a zinc roof

36
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,861
and the raindrops
made a noise

37
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:07,989
that reassured
and protected me.

38
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:15,955
That sound has followed
me all my life.

39
00:08:28,176 --> 00:08:30,094
When water moves,

40
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:32,638
the cosmos intervenes.

41
00:08:33,473 --> 00:08:37,143
Water receives the
force of the planets,

42
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:39,312
transmits it to the earth,

43
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,522
and to all living creatures.

44
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:47,987
Water is an intermediary force

45
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:51,157
between the stars and us.

46
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,329
Before the white
man arrived,

47
00:12:25,538 --> 00:12:28,249
the first inhabitants
of Patagonia,

48
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:30,584
lived in communion
with the cosmos.

49
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:36,132
They carved stones
to ensure their future.

50
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:39,844
They traveled by water.

51
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,181
They lived submerged in water.

52
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:48,018
They ate what the
water supplied.

53
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,490
They arrived ten
thousand years ago.

54
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:45,826
They were water nomads.

55
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:57,797
They lived in clans

56
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:00,633
that moved about
through the fjords.

57
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,720
They traveled from
island to island.

58
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,307
Each family kept
a fire burning

59
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:11,852
in the middle of their canoe.

60
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:16,148
There were five groups:

61
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:18,484
the Kawיsqar,

62
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:21,237
the Selk'nam,

63
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,614
the Aoniken,

64
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:26,116
the Hausch,

65
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,285
and the Yamana.

66
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:32,081
They all traveled by sea.

67
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,566
The sea...

68
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,569
The sea is one of
the places that I...

69
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:05,489
As I grew up close
to the sea,

70
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:08,659
I really love it.

71
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,120
I'd like to be able
to travel by boat

72
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,163
as we used to.

73
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:16,458
But now there are
too many restrictions,

74
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:19,211
we are barely
allowed in the sea.

75
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:21,005
Why?

76
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:25,843
The Navy demands too much
for us to be able to use the sea.

77
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,636
I have a boat I made myself.

78
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:31,432
Such a small boat
scares them.

79
00:15:31,891 --> 00:15:35,853
They're not familiar with
boats that travel in this way.

80
00:15:36,896 --> 00:15:38,564
That's why...

81
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:41,567
They claim they're
protecting us,

82
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,444
but I don't think so.

83
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:45,362
I was told

84
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,991
that you crossed Cape
Horn with your dad.

85
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:54,288
The first time we
crossed Cape Horn,

86
00:15:54,914 --> 00:15:57,625
the weather was bad.

87
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:00,294
The wind was strong.

88
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,254
The sea is very dangerous,

89
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:04,256
but we got across fine.

90
00:16:06,342 --> 00:16:07,301
How old were you?

91
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,595
Twelve years old.

92
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:12,806
<i>We went from Puma Arenas</i>

93
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:15,059
to Cape Horn and back again.

94
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:18,145
The paddles were short,
like this

95
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:21,065
because we paddled
downwards.

96
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:22,733
That's how you paddled?

97
00:16:22,942 --> 00:16:24,735
The paddle isn't
fixed to the boat?

98
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:27,237
No, we hold it in our hands.

99
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,075
The current doesn't
drag the boat away?

100
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,410
No, it doesn't.

101
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:34,954
In Cape Horn?

102
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,081
The current holds
it back a bit,

103
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:39,458
but it still moves forward.

104
00:16:45,965 --> 00:16:48,133
We still don't know

105
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:51,470
how they were able
to predict the weather.

106
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:55,599
It is estimated that
in the 19th century,

107
00:16:55,808 --> 00:17:00,229
there were 8,000 people
with 300 canoes,

108
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,190
traveling around this
vast archipelago.

109
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,863
Gabriela, do you feel Chilean?

110
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,533
Not at all.

111
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:13,659
What do you feel?

112
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,244
Kawיsqar.

113
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:19,623
I didn't tell you...

114
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,502
Once, with my mother,

115
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:27,423
we were on an island, near...

116
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,591
near Natalee.

117
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:32,386
I don't know exactly where.

118
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,638
I'd been sent there as
we didn't have water.

119
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:37,766
There was no well, no river,
nothing.

120
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:41,311
We had gone to fetch water.

121
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,731
Opposite, there was a river.

122
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:48,193
I already knew how
to paddle a little.

123
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:51,155
You need strength to paddle.

124
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:52,698
It's not easy.

125
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:56,160
It's not easy when it's windy.

126
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:59,580
The wind got up

127
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:03,792
and we couldn't reach
our camp on the island.

128
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,920
So we had to know
how to paddle,

129
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:09,798
in case we needed to
get out of trouble.

130
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:12,926
We couldn't say:

131
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:16,430
"I can't paddle",
that wasn't possible.

132
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,474
We had to be able to do it.

133
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:29,026
I learned how to dive,

134
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:31,779
I had to learn.

135
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:36,366
<i>I must have been
7 or 8 years old.</i>

136
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,414
I got a mussel on
my first dive.

137
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:44,583
That's when I was told

138
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:48,253
that I could catch
shellfish to eat.

139
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,589
This was our food.

140
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:54,218
Back then,
we ate only shellfish.

141
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:04,895
For Gabriela,

142
00:19:05,104 --> 00:19:08,232
water is part of her family.

143
00:19:09,108 --> 00:19:11,527
She accepts both
the dangers

144
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:14,571
and the food that
the sea offers her.

145
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,122
But I, as a Chilean,

146
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,707
I don't feel close
to the sea.

147
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,920
For the ocean I feel admiration

148
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,464
and at the same time, fear.

149
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:36,760
This is because of a
childhood memory.

150
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:39,847
One summer,

151
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:43,934
one of my friends was
swept away by the sea.

152
00:19:45,144 --> 00:19:48,147
He was jumping from
rock to rock,

153
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,149
amongst the waves,

154
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:54,486
that rushed in, claw-like,
between the reefs.

155
00:19:55,154 --> 00:19:58,365
His body was never recovered.

156
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:02,536
He was my first
disappeared person.

157
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,312
The indigenous
people of Patagonia

158
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:33,108
were Chile's first and
only maritime peoples.

159
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:36,528
We Chileans today

160
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:40,073
have lost this intimacy
with the sea.

161
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:57,966
I asked Emma Malig,

162
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:00,010
my painter friend,

163
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:03,847
to show me something
I've never seen.

164
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:03,633
Since I was a child,

165
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:05,427
I've never been
able to see

166
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:08,263
a complete picture
of my country.

167
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,141
In the schools,

168
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,310
there were no
walls big enough,

169
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:15,729
for such a long country.

170
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:21,360
Chile had to be divided
into three parts:

171
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,322
the north,
the center and the south,

172
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,533
as if it were
three countries.

173
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:43,298
I think this country
got its mission wrong.

174
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:47,010
We have 4,200 kilometers
of coastline.

175
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:51,306
Probably the most
coastlines in the world.

176
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:56,603
With a large mountain range
that isolates it from the continent.

177
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:59,106
The desert in the
north isolates us

178
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:04,194
from Western civilization and
a frozen continent in the South.

179
00:24:04,403 --> 00:24:06,154
We are an island,

180
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,783
in the geographical sense,

181
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:11,993
in terms of human
geography, etc.

182
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:15,622
We don't have a
maritime tradition,

183
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:19,292
and we've built up inland.

184
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:23,255
But our valley is too
narrow for agriculture,

185
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,383
so we built our future

186
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:29,845
on a very slim
economic possibility,

187
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:33,473
which, over time,
has shrunk to almost nothing.

188
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:37,936
This country has not made
proper use of its sea,

189
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:41,314
the vast ocean that
lies before it.

190
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:46,445
Few people have given
the ocean due honor,

191
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:49,322
have turned to the
sea to admire it.

192
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:52,659
Not just to admire it,
but to acknowledge it

193
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:55,579
as part of our identity.

194
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:01,626
My country denies
the Pacific ocean,

195
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:03,837
the biggest of
all the oceans.

196
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:08,925
It mistrusts its vastness,

197
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:13,513
equivalent to half the
surface of planet Earth.

198
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:18,643
However, for the indigenous
and the astronomers,

199
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:21,146
the ocean is an idea,

200
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:25,150
a concept that's
inseparable from life.

201
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:51,092
How long was the
journey of the comet

202
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:54,804
that brought us the
first drops of water?

203
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:04,022
Each drop

204
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:07,442
is a world apart.

205
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:12,239
Each drop is a breath.

206
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:40,934
As an anthropologist,

207
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:43,353
Claudio learned
from the natives,

208
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:45,522
the language of water.

209
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:53,780
Native Americans believe
all things are alive.

210
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,533
A stone is alive
and has a spirit,

211
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:58,702
water is alive
and has a spirit.

212
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:02,414
So water is a source of music.

213
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:12,132
All that moves makes a sound.

214
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:15,176
And the universe is movement,

215
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,304
so there's always sound.

216
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:22,309
It's the same water here.

217
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:25,437
If Earth's made up
of different parts...

218
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:27,397
three parts water,

219
00:27:27,606 --> 00:27:30,233
and one part earth,

220
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:33,111
what we call "earth"
is actually water.

221
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:37,198
Our bodies are made of water,
plants are water,

222
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:38,825
so everything's water,

223
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:42,829
with bits of something
more solid:

224
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:46,082
earth, stones or bones.

225
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:47,917
But everything is water.

226
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:50,545
What we breathe
is also water.

227
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:57,093
So there's nothing strange in
the fact that astrophysicists say

228
00:27:57,302 --> 00:28:00,597
that the universe
is full of water.

229
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:13,193
I began to listen to the
sound of the river,

230
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:16,821
and suddenly I began
to hear music.

231
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:20,033
A river sounds

232
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:22,744
like a thousand sounds
at the same time.

233
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:26,873
We can separate them,
listen to one at a time,

234
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:28,667
and suddenly you hear...

235
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:30,502
and you hold on
to it and then...

236
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:34,130
you have two
separate sounds

237
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:36,424
and then another...

238
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,968
and when you have
10 sounds...

239
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:43,014
That's when the jolt happens.

240
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:45,684
When you hear the noise,
that's a song,

241
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:47,102
a different sound.

242
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:04,197
An oceanographer
taught me

243
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:08,034
that the act of thinking
resembles the ocean.

244
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:13,498
The law of thought is the
same as that of water,

245
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:15,667
that is always ready

246
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:18,002
to adapt to everything.

247
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:25,385
Might this explain

248
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:28,763
how these groups of men
managed to live here

249
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:30,390
for thousands of years,

250
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:32,725
in polar temperatures?

251
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:39,983
They lived in the
most distant region,

252
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:43,152
the least inhabited.

253
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:46,823
They had no towns,

254
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:50,493
they didn't erect monuments,

255
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:53,580
but they knew
how to draw.

256
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:59,043
One of these groups,
the Selk'nam,

257
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:01,671
came up with the idea

258
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,507
of drawing on their
own bodies.

259
00:32:16,394 --> 00:32:18,563
After death,

260
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:22,567
they believed they
would become stars.

261
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,946
In their mythology

262
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:30,575
they evoke the
constellation of Orion,

263
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:33,620
and the Southern Cross.

264
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:24,022
We still don't know

265
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,524
the meanings of
these drawings.

266
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:32,030
Perhaps a Chilean poet,
Rafil Zurita,

267
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:34,449
might be able to help us.

268
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:40,663
These people were complex

269
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:42,081
and rich.

270
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:46,335
Their drawings show
the whole cosmos,

271
00:34:46,544 --> 00:34:49,422
the way they painted
their bodies,

272
00:34:49,964 --> 00:34:51,841
how they transformed them.

273
00:34:54,635 --> 00:34:55,720
For these people,

274
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:58,514
the stars are the spirits
of their ancestors.

275
00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:01,184
So what are they
searching for,

276
00:35:01,392 --> 00:35:04,854
those mighty telescopes
in the north?

277
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:06,773
They are searching,

278
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,941
essentially,

279
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:12,779
for their ancestors,

280
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:15,281
to make the universe

281
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,034
more familiar.

282
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:20,161
In one way or another,

283
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:24,040
when the Indians saw
the souls and spirits

284
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:26,709
of their ancestors,
their warriors,

285
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:32,924
they somehow felt
closer to the Universe.

286
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:35,093
They knew their
dead were there.

287
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:37,804
So what do they want?

288
00:35:38,012 --> 00:35:39,764
What are the telescopes
looking for,

289
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,808
the space probes?

290
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:45,311
To bring the universe closer.

291
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:48,314
It seems all this progress

292
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:50,900
is the product of
a deep nostalgia,

293
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:53,027
a desire to retrieve something,

294
00:35:54,362 --> 00:35:58,241
something we already knew,
in a poetic sense,

295
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:00,660
something we
inherently knew.

296
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:17,135
In 1883,

297
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:19,178
the settlers arrived,

298
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:21,472
the gold hunters,

299
00:36:21,681 --> 00:36:23,975
the military, the police,

300
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:26,561
the cattle farmers,

301
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:29,272
and the Catholic missionaries.

302
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:32,984
After centuries of
living alongside

303
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:35,611
the water and the stars,

304
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,241
the indigenous people
saw their world collapse.

305
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:43,035
The Chilean government,

306
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:45,204
who supported the colonists,

307
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:48,916
declared that the
Indians were corrupt,

308
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:52,420
cattle thieves and barbaric.

309
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:57,800
Many of them took refuge
on Dawson island,

310
00:36:58,551 --> 00:37:01,053
where the main
Mission was located.

311
00:37:02,555 --> 00:37:04,724
They took away their beliefs,

312
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:07,518
their language,
and their canoes.

313
00:37:08,186 --> 00:37:10,188
They dressed them
in old clothes

314
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:12,190
that were contaminated

315
00:37:12,398 --> 00:37:15,193
with the germs
of civilization.

316
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:16,986
Most of them

317
00:37:17,195 --> 00:37:22,074
got sick and died
within less than 50 years.

318
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:28,331
The others became prey

319
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:31,751
to those known as
"Indian hunters".

320
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:35,588
The farmers paid
one pound

321
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:38,132
for a man's testicle,

322
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:41,802
one pound for a
woman's breast,

323
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:45,890
ten shillings for a child's ear.

324
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:51,979
This story, I believe,

325
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:54,023
should be told far more often.

326
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:57,485
The Chilean settlers,

327
00:37:57,693 --> 00:37:59,570
backed by the foreign settlers,

328
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:01,072
carried on south

329
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:05,660
to establish large
farming companies.

330
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:09,538
The Chileans benefited,

331
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:13,459
buying or obtaining lands
from the government

332
00:38:13,668 --> 00:38:16,504
to occupy and turn
them into cattle farms.

333
00:38:16,796 --> 00:38:20,174
They began to exterminate
the southern people,

334
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:23,886
to wipe them out
and kill them,

335
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:26,514
in the savage way
we know about.

336
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:28,808
None of these massacres

337
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:33,854
ever resulted in the
perpetrators being accused.

338
00:38:51,956 --> 00:38:53,374
The mother is water,

339
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:58,045
she's the ocean,
the canals, the rain, all that.

340
00:39:00,298 --> 00:39:02,758
When we think of the
indigenous people

341
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:04,218
of America,

342
00:39:05,303 --> 00:39:07,763
we tend to think,
as historians,

343
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:10,391
that these people
already identified

344
00:39:10,641 --> 00:39:13,769
with their land, their territory,
with nature,

345
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:16,772
with water, in the case
of the Southern people.

346
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:19,734
They were the masters
of their country.

347
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:30,786
The last groups
sank into misery

348
00:39:30,995 --> 00:39:32,455
and alcoholism.

349
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:34,874
In the eyes of the settlers

350
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:37,418
they became monsters.

351
00:39:48,012 --> 00:39:49,555
In the 16th century,

352
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:52,475
the Spanish also
saw monsters

353
00:39:52,683 --> 00:39:54,226
in Patagonia.

354
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:58,898
They confirmed the presence
of giant savages.

355
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:01,233
They called them "Patagones",

356
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:04,111
because of their long feet.

357
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:14,705
I ask myself a question:

358
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:19,710
has the same thing happened
on other planets?

359
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:23,506
Have the strongest people

360
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:26,717
always dominated,
everywhere?

361
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:31,972
One of the planets
of the Gliese star,

362
00:40:32,181 --> 00:40:34,308
discovered in Chile,

363
00:40:34,517 --> 00:40:38,270
may have a vast ocean.

364
00:40:39,397 --> 00:40:41,774
Might it be inhabited
by living beings?

365
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:46,529
Might it have trees
to make large canoes?

366
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:51,909
Might this planet
have been a refuge

367
00:40:52,118 --> 00:40:55,454
where the Indians
could live in peace?

368
00:41:00,918 --> 00:41:05,005
Having these
thoughts is unreal.

369
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:08,968
But I dare to have them,

370
00:41:09,218 --> 00:41:12,263
because I'd love for
these water people

371
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:14,682
not to have disappeared.

372
00:42:00,102 --> 00:42:04,440
There now remain 20
direct descendants.

373
00:42:05,649 --> 00:42:07,193
Through them

374
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:10,571
their language has
survived for hundreds,

375
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:13,032
perhaps thousands of years.

376
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:41,644
A seal.

377
00:42:43,187 --> 00:42:44,813
A whale.

378
00:42:49,235 --> 00:42:50,444
Canoe.

379
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,072
Paddle.

380
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:56,742
Dad.

381
00:42:58,202 --> 00:42:59,370
Mum.

382
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:03,749
Child.

383
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:06,502
Sun.

384
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:08,712
Moon.

385
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,382
Star.

386
00:43:13,926 --> 00:43:17,763
Gabriela, I'd like you
to say in Kawיsqar:

387
00:43:17,972 --> 00:43:18,973
Beach.

388
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:21,517
Mussel.

389
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:24,937
Canoe.

390
00:43:26,105 --> 00:43:27,439
Button.

391
00:43:29,942 --> 00:43:30,776
Button?

392
00:43:32,695 --> 00:43:33,862
Shirt.

393
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:37,283
Rain.

394
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:40,369
Window.

395
00:43:42,955 --> 00:43:43,914
Sea.

396
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:46,667
Water.

397
00:43:48,711 --> 00:43:50,087
Storm.

398
00:43:54,216 --> 00:43:54,925
I got it wrong.

399
00:43:55,134 --> 00:43:56,677
Good man.

400
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:01,974
Bad man.

401
00:44:06,103 --> 00:44:07,229
God.

402
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:09,481
No, not God,

403
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,610
we don't have that.

404
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:15,070
Police.

405
00:44:17,948 --> 00:44:19,533
Police...

406
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:24,330
We don't need that either.

407
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:29,793
When she was a child,

408
00:44:30,002 --> 00:44:33,672
Gabriela crossed almost
the whole of Patagonia,

409
00:44:33,881 --> 00:44:36,467
paddling,
for 1,000 kilometers,

410
00:44:36,675 --> 00:44:38,385
in a canoe.

411
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:46,018
Is it true that when
you were a child

412
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:49,438
you made a long trip
with your family,

413
00:44:50,606 --> 00:44:53,776
from an island, to Port Eden?

414
00:44:53,984 --> 00:44:56,528
To the Gulf of Penas.

415
00:44:57,154 --> 00:44:59,990
I know the way.

416
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:03,243
I know how to get
to the Gulf of Penas,

417
00:45:03,452 --> 00:45:05,579
going through Agropolina,

418
00:45:06,163 --> 00:45:08,791
very near the island
of San Javier.

419
00:45:10,084 --> 00:45:12,294
Tell me about it in Kawיsqar.

420
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:15,839
I'm going to start

421
00:45:16,632 --> 00:45:19,259
to tell you from when
we were near...

422
00:45:20,386 --> 00:45:22,179
Cape Tomar.

423
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:34,316
I paddled all around the south.

424
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:37,945
It was known as the
"K'eaelkces' land,

425
00:45:38,195 --> 00:45:42,032
the Kawיsqar people
of the south.

426
00:45:42,616 --> 00:45:47,246
I don't know what the
area was called

427
00:45:47,496 --> 00:45:49,248
in Kawיsqar.

428
00:45:51,417 --> 00:45:54,545
When a canoe is
damaged by barnacles

429
00:45:54,795 --> 00:45:58,465
another is built
with an axe.

430
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:04,221
If the new canoe
gets a leak

431
00:46:04,513 --> 00:46:08,559
another must be made,
immediately.

432
00:46:09,977 --> 00:46:11,979
When you travel by canoe

433
00:46:12,229 --> 00:46:15,482
you get to know the
islands inside out,

434
00:46:16,024 --> 00:46:18,318
where to camp

435
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:21,488
and where to sleep.

436
00:46:24,742 --> 00:46:27,911
Sometimes we stay
there for several days,

437
00:46:28,162 --> 00:46:29,955
blocked by the wind

438
00:46:30,205 --> 00:46:34,585
and if it rains we sometimes
spend 3 months

439
00:46:34,835 --> 00:46:38,422
waiting for the sea to calm.

440
00:46:42,092 --> 00:46:44,511
I became a teenager,
then an adult

441
00:46:44,762 --> 00:46:47,097
as I paddled

442
00:46:47,347 --> 00:46:49,349
and here I am.

443
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:01,779
The first time I saw Gabriela
was in a photograph.

444
00:47:05,157 --> 00:47:06,909
It was also the first time

445
00:47:07,117 --> 00:47:10,996
that I saw nearly all
of Patagonia's survivors.

446
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:21,965
Paz Errיzuriz,

447
00:47:22,174 --> 00:47:24,259
a talented photographer
from Santiago,

448
00:47:25,177 --> 00:47:28,138
was drawn to the
faces of these people

449
00:47:28,388 --> 00:47:31,183
long before the
history text books.

450
00:47:34,478 --> 00:47:36,647
For many years,
for centuries,

451
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:39,316
the Fuegians were
invisible people.

452
00:47:56,667 --> 00:47:57,876
At the same time

453
00:47:58,085 --> 00:48:01,463
as Gabriela made her
1,000 kilometer journey,

454
00:48:01,672 --> 00:48:03,757
and dived in the sea,

455
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:05,634
I was at school

456
00:48:05,843 --> 00:48:08,178
and lived by the sea.

457
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:15,269
We school kids
knew nothing

458
00:48:15,644 --> 00:48:18,105
of the people
from the South.

459
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:21,233
Gabriela and I

460
00:48:21,483 --> 00:48:24,528
were several
centuries apart.

461
00:48:28,991 --> 00:48:30,492
During those years,

462
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:34,121
I preferred reading
Jules Verne novels.

463
00:48:34,746 --> 00:48:38,000
I didn't even know
about the only native

464
00:48:38,834 --> 00:48:41,837
who'd left his
mark on history.

465
00:48:42,713 --> 00:48:45,632
His name is Jemmy Button.

466
00:48:46,717 --> 00:48:50,721
I found out about his
life much later on.

467
00:48:52,389 --> 00:48:54,141
The adventure
of Jemmy Button

468
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:57,144
seemed almost
a legend to me,

469
00:48:57,352 --> 00:48:59,354
when I read it for
the first time.

470
00:49:00,063 --> 00:49:03,442
But this is a true story.

471
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:09,281
At the dawn of
the 19th century,

472
00:49:09,489 --> 00:49:10,490
an English boat

473
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:13,785
arrived in Patagonia,

474
00:49:13,994 --> 00:49:16,914
under the command
of Captain FitzRoy.

475
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:21,418
His mission was to
draw the lands

476
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:24,129
and coastlines
of this country.

477
00:49:25,714 --> 00:49:27,758
He drew the finest maps,

478
00:49:28,008 --> 00:49:30,677
that were used for
the next century.

479
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:34,932
He was the first person
to draw the natives

480
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,600
with a human face.

481
00:49:43,774 --> 00:49:45,108
The captain,

482
00:49:45,317 --> 00:49:47,819
a humanist,

483
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:51,365
had a surprising idea:

484
00:49:52,658 --> 00:49:55,243
to take four natives

485
00:49:55,452 --> 00:49:58,789
to England to civilize them.

486
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:05,754
One of the natives went aboard,
in exchange for a pearl button,

487
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:09,299
which is why the English

488
00:50:09,508 --> 00:50:11,635
named him Jemmy Button.

489
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:17,849
Jemmy Button was dressed
in a sailor's costume,

490
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:22,854
later on,
as an Englishman.

491
00:50:24,398 --> 00:50:26,149
For more than one year

492
00:50:26,358 --> 00:50:30,112
Jemmy Button lived on
an unknown planet.

493
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:37,202
He traveled from
the Stone age

494
00:50:37,411 --> 00:50:40,038
to the Industrial revolution.

495
00:50:41,623 --> 00:50:45,210
He traveled thousands
of years into the future.

496
00:50:45,419 --> 00:50:46,503
And then,

497
00:50:46,712 --> 00:50:49,506
thousands of years
back into the past.

498
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:34,092
After Jemmy Button had
become a gentleman,

499
00:51:34,551 --> 00:51:35,427
the captain

500
00:51:35,677 --> 00:51:38,221
took him back to Patagonia.

501
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,976
When he set foot
on his homeland

502
00:51:43,602 --> 00:51:46,855
Jemmy Button took off
his English clothes.

503
00:51:47,647 --> 00:51:50,776
He continued to
speak half in English,

504
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:53,111
half in his own language.

505
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:55,447
He let his hair grow long,

506
00:51:55,655 --> 00:51:59,159
but he was never
the same man again.

507
00:52:04,623 --> 00:52:06,083
This was the beginning

508
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:08,919
of the end of the
Southern peoples.

509
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:11,963
FitzRoy's maps

510
00:52:12,672 --> 00:52:15,425
opened the doors to
thousands of settlers.

511
00:52:29,356 --> 00:52:31,650
For 150 years,

512
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:33,485
a group of white men

513
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:37,614
governed harshly,
in a silent country.

514
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,498
Salvador Allende's revolution
broke the silence.

515
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:51,962
A major social movement arose

516
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,548
that spanned half the country.

517
00:52:55,924 --> 00:52:59,970
We heard voices we'd
never heard before.

518
00:53:03,515 --> 00:53:06,351
Allende began to give
back to the natives

519
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,688
the lands that had been
seized from them.

520
00:53:13,275 --> 00:53:15,694
The freedom didn't
last for long.

521
00:53:23,785 --> 00:53:26,705
It was destroyed
by a coup d'Etat,

522
00:53:26,913 --> 00:53:29,708
financed by the United States.

523
00:53:31,084 --> 00:53:32,836
At the same time,

524
00:53:33,044 --> 00:53:36,631
the disintegration of
a supernova star

525
00:53:36,882 --> 00:53:40,135
was seen from a
Chilean observatory.

526
00:53:41,803 --> 00:53:44,931
It was the first time
this had occurred

527
00:53:45,223 --> 00:53:47,309
so close to Earth.

528
00:53:59,905 --> 00:54:01,323
Dictatorship

529
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:02,991
struck Chile.

530
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,702
It lasted 16 years.

531
00:54:10,123 --> 00:54:13,251
There were 800 secret prisons,

532
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:16,046
with 3,500 civil servants,

533
00:54:16,296 --> 00:54:19,132
many of whom
carried out torture.

534
00:54:20,634 --> 00:54:22,093
In some regions,

535
00:54:22,302 --> 00:54:25,680
the prisoners were
butchered alive.

536
00:54:27,224 --> 00:54:29,559
Women were raped

537
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:33,271
in front of their
husbands or children.

538
00:54:34,272 --> 00:54:35,482
Men and women

539
00:54:36,316 --> 00:54:38,944
were hung from the ceiling.

540
00:54:41,071 --> 00:54:44,908
Their skin was burnt
with acid and cigarettes.

541
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:51,331
They were electrocuted
all over their bodies.

542
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:54,709
They were drugged.

543
00:54:55,794 --> 00:54:57,462
Their throats were slit.

544
00:54:58,588 --> 00:55:03,051
They were imprisoned
in boxes of 1m³.

545
00:55:15,188 --> 00:55:19,818
Usually, the information wanted,
was already known.

546
00:55:21,778 --> 00:55:23,822
They tortured to kill.

547
00:55:34,874 --> 00:55:36,376
For years,

548
00:55:36,584 --> 00:55:40,130
the military and
civilians involved

549
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:43,341
didn't say where
the prisoners were.

550
00:55:46,803 --> 00:55:47,971
Dawson island,

551
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:51,599
where hundreds of
indigenous people died

552
00:55:51,808 --> 00:55:53,810
in the Catholic missions,

553
00:55:54,102 --> 00:55:56,980
was turned into a
concentration camp

554
00:55:57,897 --> 00:56:00,066
for Salvador Allende's ministers

555
00:56:00,734 --> 00:56:04,404
who were deported
from Santiago.

556
00:56:08,408 --> 00:56:12,454
Dawson was also
used as a prison

557
00:56:12,662 --> 00:56:13,872
and torture house

558
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,459
for over 700 of
Allende's supporters

559
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:19,961
who lived in Punta Arenas,

560
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,881
capital of Patagonia.

561
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:26,551
I want you to show
me with your hands

562
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,636
where Dawson is.

563
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:39,522
I would like each of you to tell me
how long you were held in prison?

564
00:56:39,981 --> 00:56:41,900
- One and a half years
- Four years.

565
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:43,151
Four years and three months.

566
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,111
- Six months.
- Four years.

567
00:56:47,322 --> 00:56:49,199
444 days.

568
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,533
Two years and two months.

569
00:56:50,742 --> 00:56:51,826
Two and a half years.

570
00:56:52,035 --> 00:56:53,495
Two years and ten months.

571
00:56:53,703 --> 00:56:55,330
Five years and one day.

572
00:56:55,538 --> 00:56:57,332
- Six months.
- One year and seven months.

573
00:57:03,505 --> 00:57:07,217
They were victims
of a violence

574
00:57:07,425 --> 00:57:10,303
that the natives knew
only too well.

575
00:57:13,807 --> 00:57:14,849
In Chile,

576
00:57:15,058 --> 00:57:18,728
impunity accumulated
over centuries.

577
00:57:19,396 --> 00:57:22,649
Dawson is just one chapter.

578
00:58:19,372 --> 00:58:21,958
During those violent years,

579
00:58:22,542 --> 00:58:26,212
the Humboldt current
washed up a body,

580
00:58:26,463 --> 00:58:27,881
in the same region

581
00:58:28,256 --> 00:58:31,801
in which my childhood
friend had disappeared.

582
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:36,639
It wasn't the
body of a child,

583
00:58:37,182 --> 00:58:39,767
it was the body of a woman.

584
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:43,104
Nobody knew who she was.

585
00:58:47,859 --> 00:58:50,403
People began to suspect

586
00:58:50,612 --> 00:58:53,781
that the ocean
was a cemetery.

587
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:07,212
Thirty years later,

588
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:09,547
several officers
of the dictatorship

589
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:11,841
confessed that perhaps

590
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:16,095
a few people had been
thrown into the sea.

591
00:59:17,764 --> 00:59:20,934
One of them
was Marta Ugarte,

592
00:59:21,142 --> 00:59:23,102
the woman from the beach.

593
00:59:24,854 --> 00:59:28,358
The family's lawyer
knows the facts.

594
00:59:31,152 --> 00:59:35,198
Her wounds are
mainly internal.

595
00:59:36,366 --> 00:59:39,869
She shows other
signs of torture.

596
00:59:40,078 --> 00:59:42,497
She has some cuts.

597
00:59:43,498 --> 00:59:45,750
As for her face...

598
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,087
what strikes me most,
even today,

599
00:59:51,047 --> 00:59:52,674
is that she's looking at us.

600
00:59:53,967 --> 00:59:56,302
Her eyes are open,

601
00:59:56,511 --> 00:59:58,054
and she's looking at us.

602
00:59:58,972 --> 01:00:00,473
Curiously,

603
01:00:00,682 --> 01:00:03,393
her eyes are intact,

604
01:00:04,185 --> 01:00:06,145
which is unusual,

605
01:00:06,354 --> 01:00:10,191
when a body has remained
for a long time,

606
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,526
underwater.

607
01:00:12,527 --> 01:00:14,445
But that's how it
was with her,

608
01:00:14,654 --> 01:00:16,948
I find it very strange.

609
01:00:17,156 --> 01:00:21,786
Her face isn't bloated.

610
01:00:23,496 --> 01:00:25,123
And she's looking at us.

611
01:00:27,292 --> 01:00:31,004
It's as though she's
awake and looking at us.

612
01:00:36,259 --> 01:00:39,137
I wonder what was
the last thing

613
01:00:39,345 --> 01:00:40,763
that she saw?

614
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:43,016
Did she see other prisoners

615
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,268
nearby?

616
01:00:48,062 --> 01:00:49,897
I have decided
to reconstruct

617
01:00:50,148 --> 01:00:51,524
the last moments

618
01:00:51,733 --> 01:00:54,152
of a victim,
in order to believe it.

619
01:00:57,196 --> 01:00:59,032
A writer and journalist

620
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,366
will help me.

621
01:01:03,786 --> 01:01:07,707
There are various testimonies
that they were given an injection.

622
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:13,046
Some say that
it was cyanide,

623
01:01:13,254 --> 01:01:16,507
but most say that
it was pentothal.

624
01:01:17,258 --> 01:01:21,012
It was a way of guaranteeing
a prisoner's death.

625
01:01:26,142 --> 01:01:29,228
The rail was placed
on the thoracic cage.

626
01:01:29,437 --> 01:01:31,689
Higher up, on the chest.

627
01:01:38,071 --> 01:01:41,032
How much do you
think this rail weighs?

628
01:01:41,282 --> 01:01:42,408
This rail

629
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:45,953
must weigh around 30 kilos,
at least.

630
01:01:48,998 --> 01:01:51,793
The rails came from the
Puente Alto barracks.

631
01:01:52,001 --> 01:01:54,754
The rail carrier was
murdered by the DINA,

632
01:01:54,962 --> 01:01:56,422
for talking too much.

633
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:10,561
To finish off the packaging,

634
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,939
they put plastic bags,

635
01:02:13,147 --> 01:02:16,401
one over the head,
and another from the feet,

636
01:02:16,859 --> 01:02:18,736
meeting in the middle.

637
01:02:25,201 --> 01:02:27,078
The other plastic bag here.

638
01:02:35,378 --> 01:02:37,380
And potato sacks.

639
01:02:38,506 --> 01:02:40,174
Exactly the same process:

640
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:43,553
from the feet up,
and from the head down,

641
01:02:43,845 --> 01:02:46,139
to meet in the middle.

642
01:02:48,141 --> 01:02:51,853
Then they awaited the
helicopters or airplanes,

643
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:54,605
from which they'd be
thrown into the sea.

644
01:02:56,065 --> 01:02:58,651
What happened with
Marta Ugarte's body?

645
01:02:58,943 --> 01:03:01,487
What happened was
that this prisoner,

646
01:03:01,738 --> 01:03:03,531
when she was
in the airplane,

647
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:04,741
began to move.

648
01:03:04,991 --> 01:03:07,618
What they did was
to take this off her,

649
01:03:07,827 --> 01:03:10,621
untie the bags,
take them off her body.

650
01:03:12,206 --> 01:03:13,458
They opened the packaging,

651
01:03:15,293 --> 01:03:17,628
and realized she was alive.

652
01:03:17,837 --> 01:03:21,174
So they took the
wire that was here,

653
01:03:22,717 --> 01:03:23,634
and strangled her.

654
01:03:25,678 --> 01:03:30,349
The package was
then badly sealed.

655
01:03:30,558 --> 01:03:34,187
This would explain
how her body

656
01:03:34,395 --> 01:03:36,189
came to be washed ashore.

657
01:03:57,543 --> 01:03:59,337
According to judicial reports,

658
01:03:59,545 --> 01:04:02,632
the Chilean Armed
Forces tossed

659
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:08,095
between 1,200 and 1,400
people into the ocean,

660
01:04:08,471 --> 01:04:10,723
dead or alive.

661
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:15,269
They were assisted
by many civilians.

662
01:04:16,354 --> 01:04:18,022
They hoped

663
01:04:18,231 --> 01:04:22,318
that the sea would keep
the secret of the crime.

664
01:04:25,738 --> 01:04:28,866
This happened in November '79.

665
01:04:29,075 --> 01:04:30,535
Aboard the helicopter,

666
01:04:30,743 --> 01:04:34,038
the mechanic enters
the side door.

667
01:04:34,413 --> 01:04:36,666
I realized that there
were two bodies:

668
01:04:36,916 --> 01:04:39,001
one was a woman,

669
01:04:39,544 --> 01:04:41,003
who was obviously young,

670
01:04:41,212 --> 01:04:45,591
and one a man,
of more than 90 kilos.

671
01:04:46,384 --> 01:04:50,596
I could see his build,
but his face was hidden in a bag.

672
01:04:51,681 --> 01:04:54,433
A rail was attached
to the body.

673
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:59,856
Unfortunately,

674
01:05:00,064 --> 01:05:03,401
that was the most difficult
day of my career,

675
01:05:04,068 --> 01:05:05,778
I'd already said

676
01:05:05,987 --> 01:05:08,281
that God would punish us.

677
01:05:08,489 --> 01:05:10,533
What we were doing
was a crime.

678
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:20,626
On my second flight,

679
01:05:20,835 --> 01:05:23,963
that was in June 1980,

680
01:05:24,171 --> 01:05:26,048
There must have been...

681
01:05:26,257 --> 01:05:29,552
judging from the stains,

682
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,846
I think there were
8 or 9 bodies.

683
01:05:35,141 --> 01:05:38,436
I had the impression
they'd just been killed,

684
01:05:39,061 --> 01:05:41,731
given the blood stains
that were left.

685
01:05:42,106 --> 01:05:43,983
Was there more
than one civilian?

686
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:46,193
There were four civilians.

687
01:05:46,444 --> 01:05:48,237
They pushed the bodies out.

688
01:05:48,487 --> 01:05:52,074
They used the hatchway

689
01:05:52,283 --> 01:05:54,452
that's used to load cargo,

690
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:56,412
and the side doors.

691
01:05:56,621 --> 01:06:00,416
It was easier to throw
them from there,

692
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:04,420
than to drag them
to the side doors.

693
01:06:04,629 --> 01:06:07,298
Those by the side doors
were thrown out there,

694
01:06:07,506 --> 01:06:08,966
the others out the middle.

695
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,915
There's no limit
to the cruelty.

696
01:06:42,416 --> 01:06:45,378
They didn't even
have the grace,

697
01:06:45,586 --> 01:06:48,214
the compassion,
to return the dead.

698
01:06:48,506 --> 01:06:52,343
It's written in the
most ancient history:

699
01:06:52,843 --> 01:06:54,929
the enemy's dead
body is returned,

700
01:06:55,137 --> 01:06:57,390
so its relatives may
continue to live.

701
01:06:59,141 --> 01:07:02,061
For them to grieve,
the bodies must be returned.

702
01:07:02,979 --> 01:07:04,730
So the dead
may finish dying

703
01:07:04,939 --> 01:07:07,608
and the living
carry on living.

704
01:07:08,442 --> 01:07:10,111
It's so...

705
01:07:13,072 --> 01:07:15,533
It's so brutal,
what happened...

706
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:18,828
in Chile,

707
01:07:20,246 --> 01:07:21,414
in these countries.

708
01:07:25,292 --> 01:07:28,004
Impunity is a double murder,

709
01:07:28,504 --> 01:07:31,090
it's like killing
the dead twice.

710
01:07:35,094 --> 01:07:38,639
Finding the guilty is not
the end of the road.

711
01:07:38,848 --> 01:07:42,059
It's just the beginning.

712
01:07:50,609 --> 01:07:51,902
Ever since he was a child,

713
01:07:52,194 --> 01:07:56,073
Rafil Veas has dived
near to the rails.

714
01:07:57,074 --> 01:07:59,869
Almost everyone in the
town knew about them,

715
01:08:00,077 --> 01:08:02,496
but people were scared.

716
01:08:07,293 --> 01:08:09,128
In 2004,

717
01:08:09,378 --> 01:08:12,298
judge Guzmיn ordered
inspector Vignolo

718
01:08:12,506 --> 01:08:14,091
to find them.

719
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:18,471
It was Rafil who dived
to the bottom of the sea.

720
01:10:04,451 --> 01:10:06,328
Forty years later,

721
01:10:06,537 --> 01:10:10,040
the rails have become
covered with marks.

722
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:13,794
Water and its creatures

723
01:10:14,003 --> 01:10:16,755
have engraved
these messages.

724
01:10:20,718 --> 01:10:22,636
Here are the secrets

725
01:10:22,845 --> 01:10:26,056
that the bodies
left on the rails,

726
01:10:26,307 --> 01:10:28,475
before melting
into the water

727
01:10:28,684 --> 01:10:31,353
and taking on the
shape of the ocean.

728
01:11:16,774 --> 01:11:19,360
Observing each of the rails,

729
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:22,780
other remains
were discovered.

730
01:11:23,572 --> 01:11:27,785
A button was found,
stuck to a rail.

731
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:32,748
This button is the only trace

732
01:11:32,957 --> 01:11:35,292
of someone who
had been there.

733
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:55,729
From Jemmy Button,
in exchange for a pearl button,

734
01:11:56,605 --> 01:11:58,691
they took away his land,

735
01:11:58,899 --> 01:12:01,652
his freedom, his life.

736
01:12:04,029 --> 01:12:06,824
When he was returned
to his island,

737
01:12:07,032 --> 01:12:10,452
Jemmy Button never
retrieved his identity.

738
01:12:12,538 --> 01:12:16,750
He became exiled
in his own land.

739
01:12:19,712 --> 01:12:23,924
Both buttons tell
the same story,

740
01:12:24,133 --> 01:12:26,468
a story of extermination.

741
01:12:37,062 --> 01:12:40,149
There are probably
many other buttons

742
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:41,942
in the ocean.

743
01:12:55,372 --> 01:12:57,333
In this detail lies everything,

744
01:12:57,541 --> 01:13:00,210
condensed,dense,

745
01:13:00,419 --> 01:13:02,129
like a black hole.

746
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:05,632
That was my impression,

747
01:13:05,841 --> 01:13:09,345
because one can
imagine the rail,

748
01:13:09,595 --> 01:13:11,180
and trace its story:

749
01:13:11,388 --> 01:13:13,349
the workers who made it,

750
01:13:13,557 --> 01:13:16,602
who cut it, who laid it.

751
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:19,188
One can trace the
story of the button:

752
01:13:19,396 --> 01:13:21,815
the button leads
us to a person,

753
01:13:22,024 --> 01:13:24,693
a shirt, a situation.

754
01:13:25,361 --> 01:13:28,530
Perhaps to Villa Grimaldi itself,

755
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:30,574
and all that happened there.

756
01:13:30,783 --> 01:13:34,828
It's a detail that
grows and expands,

757
01:13:35,079 --> 01:13:37,790
waves that go in
different directions.

758
01:13:39,375 --> 01:13:41,043
It's the history of Chile,

759
01:13:41,251 --> 01:13:44,171
and all events of
the dictatorship.

760
01:13:57,309 --> 01:13:59,812
When you watch the sea,
the water,

761
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:02,773
you're watching
all of humanity.

762
01:14:04,691 --> 01:14:09,655
These lands, both marvelous
and in some ways blood-soaked.

763
01:14:11,907 --> 01:14:14,243
They hold the worst

764
01:14:15,327 --> 01:14:17,037
of ourselves.

765
01:14:18,372 --> 01:14:20,207
At the end of the day,
we all...

766
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:24,586
In a world of victims
and killers...

767
01:14:25,129 --> 01:14:26,505
although both exist,

768
01:14:26,713 --> 01:14:29,508
we are each responsible
for everything,

769
01:14:29,967 --> 01:14:31,635
for the victims
and the killers.

770
01:14:31,844 --> 01:14:34,221
Each human being,
no one in particular.

771
01:14:35,013 --> 01:14:38,100
So when such terrible
things happen,

772
01:14:38,308 --> 01:14:41,186
as they often have done,
throughout history,

773
01:14:42,271 --> 01:14:45,732
without participating,
we're also responsible,

774
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:50,154
as in a family in which
a child commits a crime

775
01:14:50,362 --> 01:14:52,489
and the whole
family is affected.

776
01:14:53,198 --> 01:14:54,408
So...

777
01:14:58,787 --> 01:15:00,414
this part of History,

778
01:15:00,664 --> 01:15:03,292
associated with water,
ice, volcanoes,

779
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,919
is also associated with death,
massacres,

780
01:15:06,128 --> 01:15:08,297
abuse, genocide.

781
01:15:09,756 --> 01:15:11,216
It is one part...

782
01:15:11,425 --> 01:15:15,095
If water has memory,
it will also remember this.

783
01:15:25,606 --> 01:15:27,691
All things converse
with all things,

784
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:30,444
water, rivers, plants,

785
01:15:30,652 --> 01:15:34,698
reefs, deserts,
stones, stars...

786
01:15:34,907 --> 01:15:36,617
It's one long conversation,

787
01:15:36,825 --> 01:15:39,786
a mutual regard.

788
01:15:51,048 --> 01:15:53,634
The Indians of Patagonia,

789
01:15:53,842 --> 01:15:55,844
believed that
souls didn't die,

790
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:00,432
and that they could live again,
as stars.

791
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:04,788
They say that
water has memory.

792
01:17:05,872 --> 01:17:08,875
I believe it also
has a voice.

793
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:12,045
If we were to get
very close to it,

794
01:17:12,296 --> 01:17:14,548
we'd be able to
hear the voices

795
01:17:14,798 --> 01:17:18,719
of each of the Indians
and the disappeared.

796
01:18:32,501 --> 01:18:35,837
Not long ago,
very far away,

797
01:18:36,046 --> 01:18:40,384
a Quasar was discovered,
full of water vapor.

798
01:18:41,385 --> 01:18:45,639
It holds 120 million
times more water

799
01:18:45,847 --> 01:18:48,350
than all of our seas.

800
01:18:50,644 --> 01:18:55,065
How many wandering
souls might find refuge

801
01:18:55,273 --> 01:18:59,695
in this vast ocean that's
drifting in the void?

802
01:19:00,305 --> 01:20:00,446

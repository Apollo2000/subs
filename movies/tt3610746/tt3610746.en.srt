2
00:01:11,317 --> 00:01:12,750
Yes?

3
00:01:14,065 --> 00:01:16,489
- Hello?
- <i>Mrs. Kolbein?</i>

4
00:01:16,589 --> 00:01:19,860
What? Who is this?

5
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,130
<i>This is the police, ma'am.
You need to listen to me.</i>

6
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,432
What... police?

7
00:01:26,532 --> 00:01:30,579
<i>Listen, who else is in the house?
Are you alone?</i>

8
00:01:31,035 --> 00:01:32,905
My husband's out of town.

9
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:37,053
My... my, my daughter, she's...
she's in her room.

10
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:40,846
<i>Okay, good. You both need
to stay right where you are.</i>

11
00:01:40,946 --> 00:01:43,983
- <i>We have your house surrounded.</i>
- What?

12
00:01:44,683 --> 00:01:47,920
<i>If you move from your location
you'll be putting your child in danger.</i>

13
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,922
<i>Keep your lights off.</i>

14
00:01:50,022 --> 00:01:53,926
<i>Do not approach any windows,
and stay where you are.</i>

15
00:01:54,026 --> 00:01:56,895
<i>We need you out of our way
so we can safely locate the suspect.</i>

16
00:01:56,995 --> 00:02:01,833
- What do you mean, suspect?
- <i>There is a man, possibly two.</i>

17
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:03,936
- Oh, my God!
- <i>Inside your house.</i>

18
00:02:04,036 --> 00:02:06,639
- Oh, my God! My daughter!
- <i>I need you to stay where you are!</i>

19
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:11,610
<i>Listen! Listen to me! The best way
to protect her is to work with us.</i>

20
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,414
<i>We'll keep her safe, but we need
your help. Can you help us?</i>

21
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:16,798
Yes.

22
00:02:16,898 --> 00:02:20,019
<i>And I want you to lock the door.
And don't hang up!</i>

23
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:23,155
I can't. There's no lock.

24
00:02:23,255 --> 00:02:27,460
<i>Do what you can to secure the room.
Stay put and let us do our job.</i>

25
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,972
<i>We will keep your daughter safe.</i>

26
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:41,473
<i>Now, she's good.</i>

27
00:02:41,573 --> 00:02:45,187
<i>She's secure. Do you hear anything?</i>

28
00:02:52,084 --> 00:02:54,953
Nothing. There's nothing.

29
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:57,657
- <i>You're upstairs, right?</i>
- Yeah.

30
00:02:57,757 --> 00:02:59,859
<i>Everything's happening down in the basement.</i>

31
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:02,794
<i>If you can't hear anything,
that means you're safe.</i>

32
00:03:03,994 --> 00:03:06,999
- <i>Hold on.</i>
- Okay.

33
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:09,135
<i>Ready to roll.</i>

34
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,649
I heard something.

35
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,229
I can't hear anything.

36
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:22,715
<i>We're going in.</i>

37
00:03:22,815 --> 00:03:25,551
- <i>No shot! No shot! He has the kid!</i>
- No! No!

38
00:03:25,651 --> 00:03:29,054
<i>He's down! He's down! Shit,
we need a medical for the girl now!</i>

39
00:03:29,154 --> 00:03:33,525
<i>Mrs. Kolbein, do not leave that room.
The second suspect is coming for you!</i>

40
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,272
<i>Mrs. Kolbein? Are you still there?</i>

41
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,433
<i>Mrs. Kolbein?</i>

42
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:43,836
<i>I have one last thing to tell you.</i>

43
00:03:43,936 --> 00:03:45,938
<i>I'm very sorry to inform you...</i>

44
00:03:46,038 --> 00:03:48,741
<i>...that you've been pranked, bitch!</i>

45
00:03:49,493 --> 00:03:52,077
Oh... fuck! Whoo!

46
00:03:52,177 --> 00:03:55,014
- Yes!
- Oh, so much blood!

47
00:03:55,714 --> 00:03:59,218
- Wait a minute, you got her audio, right?
- "I hope my little girl is okay!"

48
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:03,123
"No... no, I just wanna see my daughter."

49
00:04:04,823 --> 00:04:05,858
Woo!

50
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,661
That is how we do it. Seriously, people.

51
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:13,232
All right, click me some likes
and let's make this bitch go viral!

52
00:04:13,332 --> 00:04:17,268
This is Prankmonkey 69... out!

53
00:04:37,489 --> 00:04:39,891
<i>What's up, pussies?</i>

54
00:04:42,995 --> 00:04:46,297
<i>I think she actually
believed us for a second.</i>

55
00:04:56,091 --> 00:04:57,670
<i>What the fuck, man?</i>

56
00:05:01,313 --> 00:05:03,382
<i>The bitches don't care.</i>

57
00:05:03,482 --> 00:05:06,328
He's still trying to get her
dumb ass out the door.

58
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:17,863
<i>So the camera's all set,
I'm in Sam's bedroom. Yes.</i>

59
00:05:17,963 --> 00:05:20,243
<i>Holy fuck, he's...</i>

60
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,783
- <i>What the fuck, Sam?</i>
- <i>Babe, I'm sorry.</i>

61
00:05:36,883 --> 00:05:40,152
<i>All right, Brady...
I told him, he's a frickin' idiot.</i>

62
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:42,264
<i>Please, call me.</i>

63
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:48,895
<i>This is Prank Monkey 69, out!</i>

64
00:08:23,881 --> 00:08:25,394
Hello?

65
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:32,535
Hello?

66
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:40,212
Okay, I'm hanging up in about two seconds...

67
00:08:41,132 --> 00:08:42,975
- Yes! I got you!
- Shit!

68
00:08:43,075 --> 00:08:46,138
- Got you!
- Shit! You're such a dick, Brady!

69
00:08:46,238 --> 00:08:49,041
Oh, yeah, and you are a giant pussy.

70
00:08:49,141 --> 00:08:52,711
Okay? Which makes us a perfect match,
get over here. Yeah, that's right, baby.

71
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:55,033
Oh! Show me what you got.
Work with me, bitch!

72
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:58,384
- Man, stop. I'm not in the mood right now.
- Oh, trouble in paradise, I see.

73
00:08:58,484 --> 00:09:00,862
No, a little privacy. Please?

74
00:09:02,354 --> 00:09:04,156
Shit, dude.

75
00:09:05,156 --> 00:09:07,994
You and Peyton are like "done" done?

76
00:09:09,394 --> 00:09:11,630
Apparently, it's complicated.

77
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,001
Which means I have no idea what's
going on, and she won't talk to me.

78
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:20,305
That is a fucking bummer, bro.
But look on the bright side.

79
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:22,140
Yeah, I'm listening. This should be genius.

80
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,011
All right. Your parents are
out of town for the weekend.

81
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:30,916
You have the house to yourself
and you are suddenly single.

82
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:34,052
- No, I'm not single.
- And ready to mingle.

83
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:38,924
We need to get a party
going up in here right now.

84
00:09:39,024 --> 00:09:40,993
- What?
- That's not gonna happen, man.

85
00:09:41,093 --> 00:09:42,861
Besides, I have a history paper due Monday.

86
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:45,894
That's what Sunday nights
and caffeine are for. All right, stop!

87
00:09:45,994 --> 00:09:47,866
Let's go out.
I know a place that doesn't card.

88
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:50,737
Not in the mood for that kinda scene
right now. You're spilling the beer.

89
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:55,007
- Who gives a shit? Fine. Plan B.
- I think you're up to plan C now.

90
00:09:55,107 --> 00:09:58,943
I don't care what you call it, just trust me.

91
00:09:59,743 --> 00:10:02,414
- This one's a winner.
- Oh, yeah? Can't wait to hear it.

92
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:06,184
Okay, stay in, get wasted. Grab the beer.

93
00:10:06,284 --> 00:10:08,227
Take the motherfucking beer.

94
00:10:08,327 --> 00:10:11,791
And, uh... maybe make some prank calls? Agh!

95
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:18,563
- Honestly, if I don't finish this paper...
- Then life will go on. Fuck it, man.

96
00:10:19,063 --> 00:10:23,168
You really... you've got a serious case
of I'm a pussy-itis right now.

97
00:10:23,268 --> 00:10:27,672
And good time Brady is here with the cure.

98
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:31,243
All right, fine. One beer and a movie,
all right, but I'm not doing prank calls.

99
00:10:31,343 --> 00:10:33,345
- Last time we did that shit...
- Was amaze-balls!

100
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:35,814
And when Prank Monkey gets here,
you're gonna shut the fuck up.

101
00:10:35,914 --> 00:10:37,883
Whoa, hold on!
What happened to just you and me?

102
00:10:37,983 --> 00:10:41,119
When you've Prank Monkey 69
in the house. Dude is a genius at this.

103
00:10:41,219 --> 00:10:43,625
Dude, you cannot be inviting
people over. If my parents...

104
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:46,123
Your parents are too busy banging
each other in some cheap hotel room...

105
00:10:46,223 --> 00:10:49,478
- ...to care what you're doing tonight.
- Thanks. Thanks for the image, you sick fuck!

106
00:10:49,578 --> 00:10:51,730
Do you think your mom blows your dad?

107
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,199
- She seems like a giver to me.
- You are in for it!

108
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:58,333
- Oh, Mrs. Fuller!
- Oh, your titties are so huge!

109
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,843
Besides, Prank Monkey probably
won't even show.

110
00:11:04,943 --> 00:11:07,946
- Little fucker hasn't texted me back all day.
- Please do not be inviting anyone else.

111
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:12,284
And forget about making prank calls,
that shit is absolutely not happening.

112
00:11:12,384 --> 00:11:15,120
What's that guy's name across the street?
The one whose dog craps on your lawn?

113
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,873
- No, dude, not on my street.
- Dude, he deserves it.

114
00:11:17,973 --> 00:11:21,436
Besides you need a reaction shot.
You wanna see him freak out, right?

115
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,429
- It's Larry, but please...
- Ju... ju...

116
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:27,866
<i>Ginelle's Pizza, Peyton speaking.
How can I help you?</i>

117
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,703
- There's a lot of ways you can help me, honey.
- <i>Well, that may be, sir, but...</i>

118
00:11:31,803 --> 00:11:34,273
Asshole, not Ginelle's man, hang up!

119
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:38,257
- <i>...ends with taking your order.</i>
- I'm gonna need one large pepperoni...

120
00:11:38,357 --> 00:11:41,880
...to 1357 Ashton Lane.

121
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,344
- <i>Your name please?</i>
- Larry and, hey, you, uh...

122
00:11:45,444 --> 00:11:50,455
...bring that pie over here yourself.
Oh! I guarantee you a real big tip.

123
00:11:50,555 --> 00:11:52,524
<i>Yeah, 45 minutes.</i>

124
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:54,559
- Yes!
- Are you kidding?

125
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:57,062
- Relax, you have caller ID blocked.
- You had to order from Peyton?

126
00:11:57,162 --> 00:12:00,165
When she finds out it's a prank from across
the street, she's gonna know it was me.

127
00:12:00,265 --> 00:12:03,068
- Isn't it innocent until proven guilty?
- I am guilty.

128
00:12:03,168 --> 00:12:06,722
Then just do what I do, deny, deny, deny.

129
00:12:06,822 --> 00:12:11,410
All right, all right, all right.
Let's get this shit started.

130
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,113
Sir, this is Sergeant Whetherly
from Highway Patrol.

131
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:19,051
Your number was listed as an emergency
contact. Was your wife Brenda?

132
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:22,054
But last night was so much fun.
Why are you pretending not to know me?

133
00:12:22,154 --> 00:12:24,656
Is it the wife? Is she there?
Let me talk to her.

134
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:26,991
There was a pile up on the 118.
Multiple vehicles.

135
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:29,104
<i>No, there must be a mistake.
Brenda went to the movies.</i>

136
00:12:29,204 --> 00:12:31,730
- <i>She was nowhere near the 118.</i>
- Obviously you're in shock.

137
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,766
I'm gonna pass you off to a grief councilor
who can help you onto the next step.

138
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:37,369
- My condolences, sir.
- <i>Are you telling me she's dead?</i>

139
00:12:37,469 --> 00:12:41,323
That's right. I... I... I said cancer, um...

140
00:12:41,423 --> 00:12:42,978
...dick cancer, in fact.

141
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:47,345
You do have a life insurance policy, right?
Maybe that could be a silver lining?

142
00:12:47,445 --> 00:12:50,148
<i>What the hell are you talking about? I thought
you were supposed to be a grief counselor?</i>

143
00:12:50,248 --> 00:12:52,818
I'm serious, man,
you owe me for two keys of blow.

144
00:12:52,918 --> 00:12:56,121
If I ain't got that cash tomorrow
we're gonna have a serious problem here.

145
00:12:56,221 --> 00:12:58,890
Well, my daughter is as sure
as shit pregnant...

146
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,128
...and she says that you're the one
that put that demon seed inside of her.

147
00:13:03,228 --> 00:13:05,862
<i>It couldn't be me I'm a virgin, I swear.</i>

148
00:13:05,962 --> 00:13:09,934
Oh, my God! Busted,
you fucking liar, Thornton!

149
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:12,637
- I knew he didn't bang Christie.
- Yeah!

150
00:13:12,737 --> 00:13:17,042
<i>Hang on, there's somebody at my door.
She's here! Brenda's alive! She's okay.</i>

151
00:13:17,142 --> 00:13:21,780
<i>Is that you, Brady Mannion?
Oh, I'm gonna beat the shit out of you!</i>

152
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,218
Asshole, you hear me or what?

153
00:13:24,816 --> 00:13:26,896
<i>Are you having fun?</i>

154
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,322
A little bit, yeah, how about you?

155
00:13:31,422 --> 00:13:35,026
<i>Not yet, but I have a feeling
that's about to change.</i>

156
00:13:35,126 --> 00:13:37,295
What you got, big plans tonight?

157
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:42,567
<i>It's all one big joke to you, isn't it?
These phone calls you make?</i>

158
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:46,551
<i>You must feel so powerful,
sitting there on your couch...</i>

159
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:50,007
<i>...laughing at the embarrassment
and pain you cause.</i>

160
00:13:50,107 --> 00:13:52,845
- Yeah, it's pretty funny, yeah.
- <i>Maybe it's time for someone like me...</i>

161
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:56,247
<i>...to come over there and wipe
that smug grin off your face.</i>

162
00:13:56,347 --> 00:14:01,597
Okay. Well, uh, how about when
you get here, you suck my dick!

163
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,926
I guess some people really
don't like getting pranked.

164
00:14:08,026 --> 00:14:09,394
Oh, dude, pizza time, come on!

165
00:14:09,494 --> 00:14:11,129
You don't happen to have
Larry's number, do you?

166
00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:14,109
- Why?
- Let's take this shit up a notch.

167
00:14:16,634 --> 00:14:19,833
- <i>What? Hello?</i>
- Hi-dee-ho there, neighbor. This is, uh...

168
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:23,008
...Brad Gunderson from over on Elm Street.

169
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:24,910
I'm with neighborhood watch, don't you know?

170
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,528
<i>Okay, so I care why?</i>

171
00:14:26,628 --> 00:14:29,581
Well, we've had a bit of mischief
in our happy hood lately.

172
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:32,473
Teenagers and the like pretending
to be, uh... gas company workers...

173
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:37,055
...and even pizza delivery boys. They knock
on the door and see if anyone's home...

174
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:39,257
...and if no one answers, they rob the place.

175
00:14:39,357 --> 00:14:43,861
<i>Well, holy shit. I got a pizza guy
on my front porch right now.</i>

176
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:47,198
- And you didn't order one?
- <i>Hell, no.</i>

177
00:14:47,298 --> 00:14:49,133
Oh, dear.

178
00:14:49,915 --> 00:14:51,882
That's a pickle, for sure.

179
00:14:51,982 --> 00:14:55,440
Uh, just stay calm
and... uh, call the police.

180
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,122
<i>I know how to take care
of assholes like this, don't worry.</i>

181
00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:04,460
- Shit, is that Mosley?
- What?

182
00:15:06,418 --> 00:15:09,621
Dude, do you think Lar...
what do you think Larry's gonna do?

183
00:15:09,721 --> 00:15:14,359
- Hey! You wanna find out what...
- Holy shit, dude, dude, he's got a bat!

184
00:15:15,225 --> 00:15:17,429
Yes! Oh, my God!

185
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:20,280
- Take the pizza and stick it up your ass!
- Oh, my God.

186
00:15:23,902 --> 00:15:25,804
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Get down!

187
00:15:26,104 --> 00:15:28,106
Do you think he saw us?

188
00:15:28,506 --> 00:15:30,308
Not sure.

189
00:15:30,408 --> 00:15:34,456
I know you're in there,
Fuller, come on! Fuller!

190
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,581
What?

191
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:39,150
Shit's not funny, Brady.
The guy had a fucking bat.

192
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,754
- I was about to knock his old ass out!
- Your skinny ass ain't gonna knock nobody out.

193
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:45,390
- Don't test me, man, I'm serious.
- What are you gonna do?

194
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,726
You're such a dick, you know that?
You're lucky I'm working.

195
00:15:47,826 --> 00:15:48,761
Oh, he's working.

196
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:52,504
And my fucking asshole manager's
docking my pay for these... so, great.

197
00:15:52,604 --> 00:15:55,911
- Fuck that, we'll take it.
- All right, cool.

198
00:15:58,403 --> 00:16:00,672
Hey, how's Peyton tonight?

199
00:16:00,772 --> 00:16:04,075
- Oh, come on, man, don't ask me.
- I wanna know if she's doing all right.

200
00:16:04,175 --> 00:16:08,714
She seems fine.
We're really busy, man. I gotta roll.

201
00:16:10,214 --> 00:16:12,778
Hey. Quit stressing, let's eat.

202
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:26,064
I really am sorry about
what's going on with you and Peyton.

203
00:16:26,164 --> 00:16:28,901
Yeah. We'll figure it out.

204
00:16:30,251 --> 00:16:34,122
And I know like Peyton is obviously like
the hottest girl you're ever gonna be with.

205
00:16:34,222 --> 00:16:37,542
Like ever. So, it's gonna sting extra hard.

206
00:16:37,642 --> 00:16:42,747
- And you're still a dick.
- Yeah? Semper Fi, bitch!

207
00:16:43,247 --> 00:16:46,318
Dude! The Marines?

208
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:49,454
Hoo-ah! Ship out right after graduation.

209
00:16:49,554 --> 00:16:52,957
- But wait, what about film school?
- Dude, have you seen my grades?

210
00:16:53,057 --> 00:16:57,462
Nah, man. No, my only options
are working with my dad...

211
00:16:57,562 --> 00:17:00,716
...or getting as far away
from here as possible.

212
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:05,236
Shit! Man, your parents,
they must have freaked.

213
00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:07,839
That is gonna be one bomb
going off in the Mannion house...

214
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:12,377
- ...and I am in no hurry to light that fuse.
- You haven't even told them yet?

215
00:17:12,477 --> 00:17:15,147
And honestly,
it's gonna break my mom's heart.

216
00:17:15,697 --> 00:17:18,105
But I really think this'll be good for me.

217
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,693
It'll really give me a chance to
prove myself to them, you know?

218
00:17:25,122 --> 00:17:26,925
Damn, man.

219
00:17:27,725 --> 00:17:31,326
Well, you know I'm always gonna
be here, right? No matter what.

220
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:34,880
Brothers for life.

221
00:17:40,738 --> 00:17:42,751
No, dude, it might be my parents!

222
00:17:45,677 --> 00:17:47,545
Hello?

223
00:17:47,645 --> 00:17:50,715
<i>You're not the one I was speaking to before.</i>

224
00:17:50,815 --> 00:17:53,284
I'm sorry, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

225
00:17:53,384 --> 00:17:56,197
<i>The one who told me to suck his dick.</i>

226
00:17:57,922 --> 00:18:02,727
Uh, actually that was me.
Got your lips all primed, buddy?

227
00:18:02,827 --> 00:18:06,831
<i>Where does that vile hate you spew come from?</i>

228
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:10,001
<i>Do you have Mommy issues?</i>

229
00:18:10,101 --> 00:18:12,171
<i>Daddy issues?</i>

230
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:15,339
<i>Maybe I should speak to them and find out?</i>

231
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:20,145
- Yo, ass-clown, listen up!
- <i>Aren't you curious why I'm calling?</i>

232
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:22,347
<i>Why I've chosen you?</i>

233
00:18:23,347 --> 00:18:27,118
<i>Your night is about to get very exciting.</i>

234
00:18:27,218 --> 00:18:30,999
<i>So I suggest you pay attention
and no matter what...</i>

235
00:18:32,857 --> 00:18:35,893
<i>...don't hang up.</i>

236
00:18:35,993 --> 00:18:38,285
Now you're just making me do it.

237
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:45,399
Fuck him! Let's just watch a movie.

238
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:19,994
Okay. So we've been trying to watch
a movie, but this ass-humer...

239
00:19:20,094 --> 00:19:23,301
...has been calling non-stop
for the last hour.

240
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:27,112
Yo, tiny dick, give it up already.

241
00:19:28,112 --> 00:19:31,282
<i>That was very rude of you to hang up on me.</i>

242
00:19:31,382 --> 00:19:33,684
How did you even get this number?

243
00:19:33,784 --> 00:19:38,190
<i>You should know... I have a lot more
than your phone number.</i>

244
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,758
Dude, just give it up already.
We're done with you.

245
00:19:41,858 --> 00:19:44,895
<i>Actually we're just getting started...</i>

246
00:19:44,995 --> 00:19:46,608
<i>...Brady.</i>

247
00:19:50,134 --> 00:19:53,738
- What did you say?
- <i>Brady Mannion.</i>

248
00:19:53,838 --> 00:19:55,840
<i>That's you, right?</i>

249
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,604
<i>You live at, uh, 437 Oak Street.</i>

250
00:20:00,704 --> 00:20:03,548
<i>I love the American flag out front.</i>

251
00:20:05,048 --> 00:20:08,019
<i>But right now,
you're at Sam Fuller's house...</i>

252
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,733
<i>...1358 Ashton Lane.</i>

253
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:26,114
- Honestly, sir...
- <i>Oh, it's sir now, is it?</i>

254
00:20:27,305 --> 00:20:31,726
<i>Did you say sir to the others you called
tonight? Like your neighbor Larry?</i>

255
00:20:33,478 --> 00:20:35,513
Who the hell are you?

256
00:20:35,613 --> 00:20:37,882
<i>You'll find out soon enough.</i>

257
00:20:37,982 --> 00:20:40,018
<i>When we're face-to-face.</i>

258
00:20:40,618 --> 00:20:46,301
<i>For now, you can call me... Mr. Lee.</i>

259
00:20:48,793 --> 00:20:51,617
Why do you even care
who we called, like what we said?

260
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,531
<i>Don't you want the attention?</i>

261
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:57,368
<i>Well, that's why you post
your little videos online, isn't it?</i>

262
00:20:57,468 --> 00:21:00,238
<i>So the world can see how clever you are.</i>

263
00:21:00,338 --> 00:21:04,411
<i>Well, tonight I'm gonna give you
all the attention you deserve.</i>

264
00:21:50,721 --> 00:21:52,691
Get ready.

265
00:21:59,897 --> 00:22:02,599
- What the hell?
- Oh, my God, are you okay?

266
00:22:02,699 --> 00:22:05,503
- Are you guys drunk?
- A little bit, yeah. Wanna join?

267
00:22:05,603 --> 00:22:09,417
No, what I want is to deliver this pizza
and not hear from you guys.

268
00:22:18,048 --> 00:22:21,753
So, did you guys cook up this plan
with Mosley to get me over here?

269
00:22:21,853 --> 00:22:23,154
What are you talking about?

270
00:22:23,254 --> 00:22:26,090
He texted saying he was sick
right after he left here...

271
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,859
...which means I'm stuck on deliveries...

272
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:30,228
...and then all of a sudden,
you order another pizza.

273
00:22:30,328 --> 00:22:33,063
No, we didn't order this pizza.
Would I do that to you?

274
00:22:33,163 --> 00:22:35,434
You already did it once tonight.

275
00:22:36,634 --> 00:22:41,372
Hang on, hang on.
Can we... can we maybe talk?

276
00:22:41,472 --> 00:22:43,140
Sam, no, not now.

277
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,943
Five minutes. Just you and me,
upstairs in private.

278
00:22:46,043 --> 00:22:49,090
Oh, God, anchovies... what a dick move!

279
00:22:52,316 --> 00:22:55,019
Okay. Five minutes.

280
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:57,789
No, I know, it's not my fault.
Brady cranked this guy...

281
00:22:57,889 --> 00:23:00,364
So you have no responsibility here?

282
00:23:00,824 --> 00:23:02,419
No.

283
00:23:04,429 --> 00:23:07,182
Well, I mean... I mean, yeah, but...

284
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:11,803
I have to get back.

285
00:23:12,103 --> 00:23:14,748
Wait, hold on, hold on. We're not finished.

286
00:23:15,406 --> 00:23:17,075
Sam.

287
00:23:17,575 --> 00:23:19,957
Why are you in such a hurry?

288
00:23:20,477 --> 00:23:24,482
I can't do this right now. I'm... sorry.

289
00:23:24,582 --> 00:23:28,045
- I shouldn't have come up here.
- Please do not say that.

290
00:23:37,695 --> 00:23:39,296
Sorry.

291
00:23:39,596 --> 00:23:41,265
Fuck.

292
00:23:41,665 --> 00:23:45,203
We will talk,
but Mosley really did screw me...

293
00:23:45,303 --> 00:23:49,296
...by walking on his shift
and I need this job.

294
00:23:54,031 --> 00:23:57,314
- What now, dick head?
- Classy as always, Brady.

295
00:23:57,414 --> 00:24:00,952
Yeah? Well, this is the dong merchant
that ordered the anchovy pizza...

296
00:24:01,052 --> 00:24:03,353
...and made you drive all the way out here.

297
00:24:03,453 --> 00:24:06,491
- Wait, don't leave yet. Come on.
- What, dickface?

298
00:24:06,591 --> 00:24:09,003
You guys are busy... apparently.

299
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:14,098
<i>So that was the lovely Miss Peyton, was it?</i>

300
00:24:14,198 --> 00:24:16,551
- <i>I can see why you like her.</i>
- What did you say?

301
00:24:16,651 --> 00:24:21,539
<i>She seems a little upset, though.
Trouble in paradise, Sam?</i>

302
00:24:21,639 --> 00:24:24,259
Look, I don't know who the hell you are,
but this has gone on long enough.

303
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:28,550
- You need to stop this right now.
- <i>I'm afraid that's not an option.</i>

304
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:33,017
Yes, it is! All right, we're done
with your bullshit!

305
00:24:33,117 --> 00:24:36,974
- You know, I'm hanging up for good.
- <i>Go ahead, but if you do...</i>

306
00:24:37,074 --> 00:24:40,291
<i>...be prepared to reap the consequences.</i>

307
00:24:58,442 --> 00:25:01,514
Dude, I'm telling you, he's probably
just some 400-pound nerd...

308
00:25:01,614 --> 00:25:03,748
...with too much computer equipment
for his own good.

309
00:25:03,848 --> 00:25:05,716
I don't know, this guy
seems to know about stuff.

310
00:25:05,816 --> 00:25:08,189
No, dude, he's whacking off right now
in his mom's basement...

311
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:11,733
...at the thought of us
being scared. Forget him.

312
00:25:12,723 --> 00:25:14,535
What's wrong with Peyton?

313
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,039
Still not talking.

314
00:25:20,097 --> 00:25:21,671
So...

315
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:26,714
...no details?
About what's bugging her. Nothing?

316
00:25:27,788 --> 00:25:30,468
Nope. She said we'll talk later.

317
00:25:33,144 --> 00:25:34,713
Okay.

318
00:25:39,216 --> 00:25:40,428
Shit.

319
00:25:50,026 --> 00:25:54,075
Motherfucker. Sam, come here. Check this out.

320
00:25:57,968 --> 00:26:01,772
"Next time it rings, you'd better answer.
Don't test me."

321
00:26:02,772 --> 00:26:04,816
How does he have your cell phone number?
He has both our addresses...

322
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:08,756
- ...plus he knew Peyton was here.
- Maybe he called Ginello's to ask her.

323
00:26:10,281 --> 00:26:12,917
- Shit.
- Dude, this is not funny.

324
00:26:13,017 --> 00:26:15,420
- Ginello's. Think about it.
- What?

325
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,646
Who would know that Peyton's doing
deliveries has both our addresses...

326
00:26:18,746 --> 00:26:20,661
- ...and loves making prank calls?
- Mosley.

327
00:26:20,761 --> 00:26:23,828
Called in sick, my ass. You saw how pissed
he was when he left the house.

328
00:26:23,928 --> 00:26:25,996
- He even said it.
- Yeah, he said, don't test me.

329
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:28,483
Shit, dude, you're right.

330
00:26:28,933 --> 00:26:32,503
Great, he's using POPShot now.
Gonna send us a dick pick.

331
00:26:33,056 --> 00:26:34,772
What the hell?

332
00:26:34,872 --> 00:26:38,809
- "Not Mosley... guess again."
- How does he know what we said?

333
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:41,088
Dude, what is this picture?

334
00:26:44,949 --> 00:26:46,768
No idea.

335
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,315
- Is that a person in a chair?
- Yeah, it could be, it's kind of...

336
00:26:56,593 --> 00:27:00,297
No, no, shit, dude. No, no, that looked
like someone was tied up or something.

337
00:27:00,397 --> 00:27:03,868
Okay, this is getting really weird, dude.
This is definitely beyond Mosley.

338
00:27:31,128 --> 00:27:34,956
<i>You're right, Sam.
This is definitely beyond Mosley.</i>

339
00:27:43,174 --> 00:27:45,542
Oh... holy shit!

340
00:27:45,642 --> 00:27:47,488
What is it?

341
00:27:49,313 --> 00:27:51,159
My parents.

342
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,920
- Why the hell are you doing this?
- <i>Aren't we still having fun?</i>

343
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,823
<i>Don't you like my surprise?</i>

344
00:27:58,923 --> 00:28:02,793
<i>I went through a lot of trouble
to make tonight special for all of us.</i>

345
00:28:02,893 --> 00:28:04,428
Son of a bitch. I swear to...

346
00:28:04,528 --> 00:28:07,932
<i>You're not the one in control
here, Brady. I am!</i>

347
00:28:08,032 --> 00:28:12,703
<i>So if you want your parents to live,
you will not hang up.</i>

348
00:28:12,803 --> 00:28:15,957
<i>You'll stay on the line and do as I s...</i>

349
00:28:16,307 --> 00:28:18,775
What the fuck are you doing?
He said don't hang up!

350
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:21,612
Brady, Brady, calm down!
He's at your house, all right?

351
00:28:21,712 --> 00:28:23,247
Your parents are tied up
in your own living room.

352
00:28:23,347 --> 00:28:25,700
I saw the clock and I saw
the chairs they were sitting on.

353
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,803
Listen, we call 911 and they'll get
to this guy before he can do anything.

354
00:28:31,388 --> 00:28:33,090
Trust me.

355
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:35,203
Okay, just do it!

356
00:28:36,994 --> 00:28:39,073
Come on, come on.

357
00:28:39,897 --> 00:28:41,977
Come on, come on.

358
00:28:44,935 --> 00:28:47,705
- <i>9-1-1.</i>
- Hi, yeah, we need your help right away.

359
00:28:47,805 --> 00:28:50,140
- <i>What's your emergency?</i>
- A fucking psycho has my parents!

360
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,653
<i>Please calm down, speak clearly,
and don't use profanity.</i>

361
00:28:52,753 --> 00:28:55,090
- He's gonna kill them! Send the cops!
- Brady, stop!

362
00:28:55,209 --> 00:28:58,216
<i>Son, I won't ask you again.
Control your language or I can't help you.</i>

363
00:28:58,316 --> 00:29:00,304
Are you fucking kidding me?

364
00:29:00,404 --> 00:29:03,316
Just send a police car right away, all right?
The guy is in the house with them.

365
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:04,773
<i>Can you describe the suspect?</i>

366
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:08,959
No, we don't know, but psycho
covered the house in plastic.

367
00:29:11,428 --> 00:29:13,464
<i>That's right, Brady.</i>

368
00:29:14,364 --> 00:29:17,401
<i>You have no idea what I look like.</i>

369
00:29:18,301 --> 00:29:20,168
<i>And yet...</i>

370
00:29:20,553 --> 00:29:23,444
<i>...I know everything about you.</i>

371
00:29:23,544 --> 00:29:25,132
Gimme your phone now.

372
00:29:29,112 --> 00:29:31,382
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!

373
00:29:31,482 --> 00:29:33,884
<i>Afraid it's not gonna be that easy.</i>

374
00:29:33,984 --> 00:29:37,936
- Shit! Shit, shit, shit!
- Wait, wait, where are you going?

375
00:29:38,036 --> 00:29:41,493
I don't know. Just next door 'cause...
just anywhere to use another phone.

376
00:29:41,593 --> 00:29:44,039
- Brady, wait, stop!
- What?

377
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,959
He's watching us.

378
00:30:06,951 --> 00:30:08,464
What?

379
00:30:20,563 --> 00:30:21,732
What do you want?

380
00:30:21,832 --> 00:30:26,470
<i>You like manipulating people, don't you?
Playing God.</i>

381
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:30,841
<i>Well, tonight I'm giving you boys
the ultimate power.</i>

382
00:30:30,941 --> 00:30:35,623
<i>You get to decide who lives and who dies.</i>

383
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:08,245
Oh, my God.

384
00:31:08,645 --> 00:31:10,925
Oh, my God, who is that?

385
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:23,828
No.

386
00:31:24,628 --> 00:31:27,297
<i>Prank Monkey 69.</i>

387
00:31:27,397 --> 00:31:31,613
<i>Say goodbye to your audience
for the last time.</i>

388
00:31:37,491 --> 00:31:40,494
No! No!

389
00:31:40,594 --> 00:31:43,207
No! Stop it now!

390
00:31:47,617 --> 00:31:49,463
Stop it!

391
00:31:55,859 --> 00:31:59,741
<i>How many clicks do you think
Prank Monkey will get for this video?</i>

392
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:16,614
<i>That little fun was recorded yesterday.</i>

393
00:32:17,314 --> 00:32:21,887
<i>A warm-up for tonight's live main event.</i>

394
00:32:45,942 --> 00:32:48,022
What the hell was that?

395
00:32:59,623 --> 00:33:01,909
<i>No. Please.</i>

396
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,547
Why do that? Why?

397
00:33:41,297 --> 00:33:43,785
Son of a bitch, he's here.

398
00:33:44,935 --> 00:33:47,982
Mosley's either at the back door or upstairs.

399
00:33:54,945 --> 00:33:57,025
That was definitely upstairs.

400
00:34:00,384 --> 00:34:03,860
Brady... it's okay.

401
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,134
I'll go.

402
00:35:47,924 --> 00:35:50,895
<i>I knew you'd be the one to stay, Brady.</i>

403
00:35:50,995 --> 00:35:54,964
<i>Not quite the boy scout that Sam is, are you?</i>

404
00:35:55,064 --> 00:35:57,065
<i>But then again...</i>

405
00:35:57,165 --> 00:36:01,538
<i>...that's what I'm counting on
because I have a deal for you.</i>

406
00:36:01,638 --> 00:36:06,643
<i>One that will let your parents
and you escape tonight alive.</i>

407
00:36:07,743 --> 00:36:09,623
<i>Do you wanna hear it?</i>

408
00:36:11,815 --> 00:36:15,252
<i>You'll need to give me something in return.</i>

409
00:36:16,152 --> 00:36:19,200
<i>A life for a life.</i>

410
00:36:58,929 --> 00:37:02,666
Son of a bitch. Brady! Brady!

411
00:37:02,766 --> 00:37:05,402
Mosley's at the back door.
He's at the back door!

412
00:37:05,502 --> 00:37:08,148
Brady! Brady, he's at the back door!

413
00:37:12,542 --> 00:37:13,755
Fuck!

414
00:37:17,163 --> 00:37:18,829
Come on!

415
00:37:39,035 --> 00:37:41,485
Mosley! Mosley!

416
00:37:47,377 --> 00:37:49,441
Mosley. Mosley?

417
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,056
No. Come on.

418
00:37:59,356 --> 00:38:02,361
Mosley's still alive, Brady!

419
00:38:02,591 --> 00:38:05,039
Brady! Brady!

420
00:38:07,396 --> 00:38:09,033
Brady.

421
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:11,601
Brady, help!

422
00:38:11,701 --> 00:38:14,715
Stay with me. Brady, help me!

423
00:38:16,439 --> 00:38:20,610
Hold on. Don't... please. I'm taking it off.
I'm taking it off. I'm taking off.

424
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:23,647
No! No! No! No! No, no, no, no!

425
00:38:23,747 --> 00:38:26,417
No! No, no, no, no!

426
00:38:36,626 --> 00:38:39,096
Please stay with me, please?

427
00:38:39,796 --> 00:38:42,013
No. No.

428
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:53,285
Bra... Brady. Brady. Brady.

429
00:39:15,698 --> 00:39:17,545
Close the door.

430
00:39:19,503 --> 00:39:23,384
- What?
- Close the fucking door!

431
00:40:27,871 --> 00:40:29,854
I can't stay here.

432
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,859
Do not answer that.

433
00:40:47,523 --> 00:40:49,036
Hello?

434
00:40:50,394 --> 00:40:54,230
- Hey! Hey, put it on speaker, so I can...
- No. I can't.

435
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:57,968
- Put it on speaker, goddamn it, now!
- He's gone, okay?

436
00:40:58,568 --> 00:41:01,738
Yeah, he told you something. What was it?

437
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:05,375
He said it's time to decide
who lives and who dies.

438
00:41:06,175 --> 00:41:08,455
What the fuck does that mean?

439
00:41:11,281 --> 00:41:13,093
I don't know.

440
00:41:15,785 --> 00:41:17,650
We should run, Sam.

441
00:41:19,055 --> 00:41:22,459
You and me. This is our chance.

442
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:26,462
- Yeah, and he's gonna kill your parents.
- Like he said, it's a choice.

443
00:41:27,862 --> 00:41:30,444
Us or them.

444
00:41:32,168 --> 00:41:34,401
They would want us to save ourselves.

445
00:41:36,122 --> 00:41:38,002
Wouldn't your parents?

446
00:41:41,611 --> 00:41:44,280
We have to try. I mean,
there's gotta be a way out of this.

447
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,616
- What did that guy say on the phone?
- Nothing.

448
00:41:46,716 --> 00:41:48,828
You're lying, tell me the truth.

449
00:41:51,354 --> 00:41:54,213
If we stay here, we're gonna die, too.

450
00:42:01,181 --> 00:42:02,582
Come on.

451
00:42:06,903 --> 00:42:10,406
- Wait, wait, wait, that's my house.
- Whatever it is, it's bullshit, don't watch.

452
00:42:10,506 --> 00:42:14,387
Yeah, but what if that's a live shot?
What if he's out there waiting for us?

453
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,803
No, no, no, no, no.

454
00:42:33,997 --> 00:42:36,225
She's not there, I can't see her.

455
00:42:37,767 --> 00:42:40,180
Oh, my God. You son of a bitch!

456
00:42:43,707 --> 00:42:45,218
No.

457
00:42:49,379 --> 00:42:52,592
Look, we have to get out. Now, Sam!

458
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:55,599
Is that what he told you?

459
00:42:56,352 --> 00:42:58,555
Did you know he went after Peyton?

460
00:42:59,355 --> 00:43:04,360
You did, man, you knew! What, you
expect me just to walk away from them?

461
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,337
This is the only way you and I
both make it out of this.

462
00:43:07,437 --> 00:43:10,167
- No, man, you're not leaving!
- Stop! Come on.

463
00:43:10,267 --> 00:43:13,169
No, dude, we have to save them. Listen to me.

464
00:43:15,905 --> 00:43:18,942
Fuck him and fuck you!
They could be dead for all we know.

465
00:43:19,042 --> 00:43:21,411
No, Brady, stop you're not leaving!

466
00:43:21,511 --> 00:43:23,190
Get off!

467
00:43:48,938 --> 00:43:51,474
Brady! Brady.

468
00:43:51,574 --> 00:43:55,255
Brady, come on, wake up!
Brady, wake up, come on!

469
00:44:15,064 --> 00:44:17,053
No, Peyton! Peyton!

470
00:44:17,533 --> 00:44:21,555
Oh, my God! Peyton, can you hear me?

471
00:44:21,938 --> 00:44:25,241
It's gonna be all right,
I promise you I'm gonna...

472
00:44:25,341 --> 00:44:27,954
No! Hey, come back!

473
00:44:33,983 --> 00:44:35,585
Okay.

474
00:44:35,985 --> 00:44:37,593
Please...

475
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:40,299
...what can I do to make you let her go?

476
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:49,766
- Tell me!
- <i>In order to save Peyton...</i>

477
00:44:49,866 --> 00:44:53,513
<i>...you'll need to give me
something in return.</i>

478
00:44:54,103 --> 00:44:56,530
<i>I'll let her go...</i>

479
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:59,671
<i>...if you kill Brady.</i>

480
00:45:01,277 --> 00:45:04,344
<i>A life for a life.</i>

481
00:45:06,783 --> 00:45:11,021
<i>I offered Brady the same chance
to save himself and his parents.</i>

482
00:45:11,121 --> 00:45:13,123
<i>He tried to save you, instead.</i>

483
00:45:13,223 --> 00:45:16,860
<i>He begged you to leave, but you stopped him.</i>

484
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,073
<i>I wonder if his choice
would be different now?</i>

485
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:35,779
<i>Of course, you can walk out the door
any time you want, you'll be free.</i>

486
00:45:35,879 --> 00:45:38,115
<i>But everyone else dies.</i>

487
00:45:39,345 --> 00:45:43,111
<i>Time to decide
what's more important, yourself...</i>

488
00:45:43,211 --> 00:45:45,532
<i>...or the people you love.</i>

489
00:46:38,908 --> 00:46:42,979
Dude, dude, come on. Ah, come on.

490
00:47:00,129 --> 00:47:02,165
I'm sorry, but you can't leave.

491
00:47:02,265 --> 00:47:05,835
Let me out of this right now.
Right now! Ugh! Fuck!

492
00:47:08,035 --> 00:47:11,007
You asshole! Let me loose! Let me loose!

493
00:47:11,107 --> 00:47:15,228
If you leave now, your parents,
they're dead, all right? Peyton is dead.

494
00:47:15,978 --> 00:47:19,392
So if this is what it takes
to keep you here, then fine.

495
00:47:21,884 --> 00:47:24,097
Fine.

496
00:47:26,489 --> 00:47:29,970
Just... let me out of this.

497
00:47:31,027 --> 00:47:33,513
- We'll figure it out together.
- No.

498
00:47:33,613 --> 00:47:35,415
I can't risk you making a break for the door.

499
00:47:35,515 --> 00:47:37,417
What the fuck are you gonna do to save them?

500
00:47:37,517 --> 00:47:39,869
I don't know, man,
but what are we supposed to do, huh?

501
00:47:39,969 --> 00:47:42,181
What, take him up on his offer?

502
00:47:43,072 --> 00:47:45,875
Yeah, he made me the same deal.

503
00:47:45,975 --> 00:47:48,211
Your life for mine and Peyton's.

504
00:47:48,311 --> 00:47:51,447
- And you fucking believe him?
- I don't know what to believe right now.

505
00:47:51,547 --> 00:47:56,019
This guy's doing all of this for a reason,
man, and we have to figure out what it is.

506
00:47:56,719 --> 00:47:58,732
Oh, my God.

507
00:48:00,156 --> 00:48:03,326
Sam, dude, come on, help me out.

508
00:48:03,426 --> 00:48:06,095
Get me out of this, okay? He's in the house.

509
00:48:06,195 --> 00:48:09,243
Come on, man! Come on.

510
00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:03,352
<i># Hush, little baby, don't say a word #</i>

511
00:49:03,452 --> 00:49:06,623
<i># Papa's gonna buy you a mocking bird #</i>

512
00:49:06,723 --> 00:49:10,059
<i># And if that mocking bird won't sing #</i>

513
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:13,764
<i># Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring #</i>

514
00:49:14,864 --> 00:49:17,667
<i>Will you send Daddy this video tonight?</i>

515
00:49:17,767 --> 00:49:21,337
- <i>Sure. Go on.</i>
- <i>Okay. I miss you, Daddy.</i>

516
00:49:21,437 --> 00:49:26,009
<i>Can't wait till you get back home
and I love you 'til the end of time.</i>

517
00:49:26,109 --> 00:49:27,454
What?

518
00:49:29,445 --> 00:49:31,340
I got a friend request earlier.

519
00:49:33,983 --> 00:49:37,420
It's the same user from his POPShot.
The picture.

520
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,589
Dude, it's that girl he just showed us.

521
00:49:40,389 --> 00:49:42,191
Holy shit.

522
00:49:42,391 --> 00:49:44,238
It's photos of us.

523
00:49:47,863 --> 00:49:50,810
Mosley, Prank Monkey, Peyton.

524
00:49:53,502 --> 00:49:57,740
Some of these pictures are from at least
6 months ago. This one's from last summer.

525
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:01,077
He's been watching us for almost a year? Why?

526
00:50:01,177 --> 00:50:03,942
I don't know, but hold on,
there's a video here. It says...

527
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,404
...Peyton Video 3.

528
00:50:06,648 --> 00:50:09,618
Oh, shit... no, that's from my computer, Sam.

529
00:50:09,718 --> 00:50:13,213
Sam, don't watch that, okay. I... Sam!

530
00:50:13,989 --> 00:50:15,571
Sam!

531
00:50:15,989 --> 00:50:19,155
Look, I don't even know
how the fuck he got it, it's just...

532
00:50:19,255 --> 00:50:21,641
Fuck! Come on!

533
00:50:26,386 --> 00:50:30,642
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

534
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:34,253
<i>Okay, hurry, no wax.</i>

535
00:50:36,078 --> 00:50:38,738
<i>I don't think I can keep doing this.</i>

536
00:50:39,315 --> 00:50:41,718
<i>We should talk to him about what happened.</i>

537
00:50:42,868 --> 00:50:44,704
<i>Wait, why?</i>

538
00:50:45,454 --> 00:50:48,925
<i>It'll ruin our friendship.
You wouldn't do that to me, would you?</i>

539
00:50:49,025 --> 00:50:52,939
<i>I... I don't know, Brady.
How can I not talk to him about it?</i>

540
00:50:55,531 --> 00:50:57,420
<i>Where's my other shoe?</i>

541
00:51:09,945 --> 00:51:12,215
<i>What the hell is this, Brady?</i>

542
00:51:13,215 --> 00:51:14,584
<i>What?</i>

543
00:51:14,684 --> 00:51:16,486
<i>Did you...</i>

544
00:51:17,086 --> 00:51:19,253
<i>Did you record us having sex?</i>

545
00:51:20,123 --> 00:51:21,383
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

546
00:51:21,483 --> 00:51:24,995
<i>This is not fucking funny, Brady!
How could you violate me like this?</i>

547
00:51:25,095 --> 00:51:28,565
<i>It's not that big a deal. I mean,
you came over here to be slutty anyway.</i>

548
00:51:28,665 --> 00:51:31,935
<i>Fuck you, Brady! Fuck you!</i>

549
00:51:32,035 --> 00:51:34,487
<i>Have you done this before?</i>

550
00:51:34,587 --> 00:51:38,441
- <i>No, no, I swear...</i>
- <i>Oh, my God! Fuck!</i>

551
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:41,911
- <i>We are so done!</i>
- <i>Oh, Peyton, come on!</i>

552
00:51:42,011 --> 00:51:45,414
<i>Don't you dare get up!
Don't ever speak to me again.</i>

553
00:51:45,514 --> 00:51:47,817
<i>Don't even acknowledge me.</i>

554
00:51:47,917 --> 00:51:51,753
- <i>You know what, fine, go, slut!</i>
- <i>Fuck you, Brady!</i>

555
00:51:57,393 --> 00:52:00,797
<i>Yeah, always got my number two
camera in the corner.</i>

556
00:52:00,897 --> 00:52:03,810
<i>Ah, get that pussy, yeah.</i>

557
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,142
You fucking dick!

558
00:52:13,242 --> 00:52:15,178
What was that, huh?

559
00:52:15,278 --> 00:52:18,481
You're supposed to be my best friend.
What happened to brothers for life?

560
00:52:18,581 --> 00:52:21,027
Me? Fu...

561
00:52:21,984 --> 00:52:25,831
What about her?
She's the one that cheated on you.

562
00:52:27,723 --> 00:52:31,694
What was that, huh? What was that? Tell me.

563
00:52:31,794 --> 00:52:33,606
Fuck you!

564
00:52:59,755 --> 00:53:03,192
I wanna see Peyton right now!
I wanna know she's still alive!

565
00:53:03,692 --> 00:53:06,862
<i>Don't worry, she's perfectly safe.</i>

566
00:53:06,962 --> 00:53:09,565
Yeah, well, let me talk to her,
you asshole! I want proof.

567
00:53:09,665 --> 00:53:13,870
<i>If you really want to see her,
then you'll do what I asked.</i>

568
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:16,840
<i>Come on, Sam.</i>

569
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:21,510
<i>I can tell you want to.
It must be very tempting.</i>

570
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:24,480
<i>Punish him to save her.</i>

571
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:29,905
<i>I'll gladly let Peyton go as soon
as you give Brady what he deserves.</i>

572
00:53:30,005 --> 00:53:34,690
<i>Wouldn't that feel good right now,
considering what he's done to you?</i>

573
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:36,892
Please, just...
will you listen to me really...

574
00:53:36,992 --> 00:53:38,705
You need to shut up!

575
00:53:42,631 --> 00:53:45,068
This is what he wanted the whole time.

576
00:53:46,068 --> 00:53:48,147
To turn us against each other.

577
00:53:50,673 --> 00:53:52,576
What about Brady's parents?

578
00:53:53,826 --> 00:53:56,028
If I do what you say, what happens to them?

579
00:53:56,128 --> 00:53:58,197
<i>I get what I want.</i>

580
00:53:58,647 --> 00:54:02,095
<i>I suppose you can be their savior, too.</i>

581
00:54:35,818 --> 00:54:37,620
Where are you right now, Mr. Lee?

582
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:41,324
I wanna see you and Peyton on the screen
right now before I do anything.

583
00:54:41,924 --> 00:54:44,192
- Wait, why, what is it?
- The video isn't live, man...

584
00:54:44,292 --> 00:54:47,071
...the clock on the wall
is almost two hours behind.

585
00:55:19,094 --> 00:55:21,530
What did you do with my parents?

586
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:24,968
<i>You're in no position
to ask questions, Brady.</i>

587
00:55:26,068 --> 00:55:31,699
<i>Seems to me, Sam's the one in control.
So, what'll it be, Sam?</i>

588
00:55:32,274 --> 00:55:34,153
<i>Last chance.</i>

589
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:51,294
No, Sam, please, no.
No, no, no, no no, no, no!

590
00:55:51,394 --> 00:55:53,242
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

591
00:55:53,896 --> 00:55:55,942
I'm done with this bullshit.

592
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,604
That is enough, all right? Your little
game to turn us against each other...

593
00:56:01,704 --> 00:56:05,674
...to hurt each other, it is not gonna happen.
All right, I'm not going to do it.

594
00:56:05,774 --> 00:56:09,044
Now, turn the video back on in real time.

595
00:56:09,144 --> 00:56:12,949
I wanna see Peyton and I wanna
see Brady's parents right now!

596
00:56:13,749 --> 00:56:15,817
<i>I'm sorry, boys.</i>

597
00:56:15,917 --> 00:56:18,721
<i>I haven't been entirely honest with you.</i>

598
00:56:18,821 --> 00:56:20,698
<i>In fact...</i>

599
00:56:22,089 --> 00:56:23,855
<i>...you've been pranked.</i>

600
00:56:28,697 --> 00:56:31,334
<i>Yo, tiny dick, give it up already.</i>

601
00:56:32,834 --> 00:56:35,874
<i>That was very rude of you to hang up on me.</i>

602
00:56:38,374 --> 00:56:40,845
<i>Dude, just stop, we're done with you.</i>

603
00:56:43,145 --> 00:56:44,820
<i>Actually...</i>

604
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:48,383
<i>...we're just getting started, Brady.</i>

605
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:55,630
<i>What did you say?</i>

606
00:56:57,159 --> 00:57:00,730
<i>Brady Mannion, that's you, right?</i>

607
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:04,034
<i>You live at 437 Oak Street.</i>

608
00:57:05,834 --> 00:57:08,237
<i>Love the American flag out front.</i>

609
00:57:08,337 --> 00:57:11,454
- <i>Honestly, sir...</i>
- <i>Oh, it's sir now, is it?</i>

610
00:57:11,554 --> 00:57:15,578
<i>Did you say, "sir" to the others you called
tonight, like your neighbor Larry?</i>

611
00:57:15,678 --> 00:57:18,681
- <i>Who the hell are you?</i>
- <i>You'll find out soon enough...</i>

612
00:57:18,781 --> 00:57:23,085
<i>...when we're face-to-face.
For now, you can call me...</i>

613
00:57:23,185 --> 00:57:25,431
<i>...Mr. Lee.</i>

614
00:57:30,292 --> 00:57:33,939
<i>No! Please, no, no, no!</i>

615
00:57:43,938 --> 00:57:45,441
Brady.

616
00:57:46,441 --> 00:57:48,277
Brady, get up!

617
00:58:50,139 --> 00:58:52,231
Peyton's probably dead, too.

618
00:58:55,477 --> 00:58:57,849
I'll stay and cover your back.

619
00:58:58,614 --> 00:59:00,724
You go out the front...

620
00:59:00,824 --> 00:59:04,557
...get as far away from here
as you can, and call for help.

621
00:59:04,657 --> 00:59:07,266
No, no, no, I'm not leaving you alone.

622
00:59:09,825 --> 00:59:11,871
Brothers for life, right?

623
00:59:13,996 --> 00:59:15,879
Now, I screwed up.

624
00:59:18,667 --> 00:59:21,150
Maybe this is my one chance to make it right.

625
00:59:22,371 --> 00:59:24,674
Go... get the fuck out of here.

626
00:59:24,774 --> 00:59:28,614
No, man, I'm not leaving you alone.
All right, we can leave together.

627
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:33,549
Your parents are dead, right?
And you're right, most likely so is Peyton.

628
00:59:33,649 --> 00:59:38,921
So, the best way to get to this guy is to
escape now and we go to the police, okay?

629
00:59:39,521 --> 00:59:41,033
Right.

630
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:55,415
Come on, come on. Come on. Let's go.

631
01:00:02,111 --> 01:00:04,271
- Okay, looks clear.
- All right, let's hurry.

632
01:00:06,715 --> 01:00:09,952
- Brady, open up! Brady, get out here!
- You go.

633
01:00:10,052 --> 01:00:12,455
- Brady, open the fucking door!
- I'm not done here.

634
01:00:12,555 --> 01:00:15,591
Brady, open that fucking door
right this second!

635
01:00:16,391 --> 01:00:19,805
Brady, please open the door.

636
01:00:20,796 --> 01:00:23,398
Man, come on out here, come on.

637
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:27,203
Get the fuck out here, Brady!

638
01:00:27,303 --> 01:00:31,350
Brady, I'm not kidding, get out here!
Damn it, Brady!

639
01:00:38,864 --> 01:00:40,393
Peyton.

640
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,883
Oh, my God.

641
01:02:54,483 --> 01:02:57,652
Fuck! Okay, hold on!
Hold on, I've got you, all right?

642
01:02:57,752 --> 01:03:02,020
You're safe. You're safe.
Come on, Peyton, come on.

643
01:03:11,466 --> 01:03:14,271
You're safe. I've got you, come on.

644
01:03:16,571 --> 01:03:18,617
Let's go, all right?

645
01:03:23,978 --> 01:03:25,558
Mosley?

646
01:03:28,116 --> 01:03:29,953
Oh, shit.

647
01:03:54,142 --> 01:03:55,812
Shit!

648
01:03:56,912 --> 01:04:00,065
Listen to me, all right, you need to call
the police, then hide until they get here.

649
01:04:00,165 --> 01:04:02,912
Trust me, you can do this. All right?

650
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:17,710
Where is he?

651
01:05:28,503 --> 01:05:30,038
Brady?

652
01:05:30,638 --> 01:05:32,051
Brady?

653
01:05:54,363 --> 01:05:56,665
<i># Hush, little baby, hush, little baby #</i>

654
01:05:56,765 --> 01:06:01,026
<i># Hush, little baby, don't say a word #</i>

655
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:03,382
Brady?

656
01:06:04,339 --> 01:06:05,771
Brady?

657
01:06:08,143 --> 01:06:09,688
Brady?

658
01:06:14,182 --> 01:06:15,694
Fuck.

659
01:06:24,259 --> 01:06:26,138
<i>I miss you, Daddy.</i>

660
01:06:36,771 --> 01:06:39,992
<i># Gonna buy you a mockingbird #</i>

661
01:06:47,482 --> 01:06:48,994
Peyton!

662
01:06:50,953 --> 01:06:52,487
Peyton!

663
01:07:00,195 --> 01:07:01,696
Peyton!

664
01:07:06,067 --> 01:07:09,137
Sam, watch out! Sam!

665
01:07:13,542 --> 01:07:14,953
Sam!

666
01:07:56,718 --> 01:07:58,397
I wanna see him.

667
01:08:00,122 --> 01:08:01,890
Are you okay?

668
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:04,869
I'm okay. I'm okay.

669
01:08:08,196 --> 01:08:11,476
You're safe. It's over now.

670
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:14,311
He can't hurt us anymore.

671
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:20,719
No!

672
01:08:23,411 --> 01:08:24,779
No!

673
01:08:24,879 --> 01:08:27,516
No, no, Brady!

674
01:08:27,616 --> 01:08:29,584
No, Brady!

675
01:08:29,684 --> 01:08:31,686
Brady, no!

676
01:08:32,386 --> 01:08:33,999
Brady!

677
01:08:34,623 --> 01:08:36,698
Brady, please!

678
01:08:36,798 --> 01:08:39,694
Peyton... Peyton, get it off of him, please!

679
01:08:39,794 --> 01:08:43,432
Brady, stay with me, man!
Brady, look at me! Stay with me!

680
01:08:43,532 --> 01:08:45,534
Open your eyes!

681
01:08:46,234 --> 01:08:49,170
Come on. Brady, I'm sorry.

682
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:51,406
Brady, I love you, I'm sorry!

683
01:08:51,506 --> 01:08:53,319
Brady, please!

684
01:08:56,244 --> 01:08:59,781
Brady, come on! Brady, come on!

685
01:08:59,881 --> 01:09:01,950
Brothers for life.

686
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:03,896
Come on, man!

687
01:09:08,122 --> 01:09:10,402
Brady, I'm so sorry.

688
01:09:11,326 --> 01:09:13,005
Brady.

689
01:09:23,371 --> 01:09:27,453
I don't understand
why you're doing this to us. Why?

690
01:09:28,843 --> 01:09:31,647
I'm simply returning the favor.

691
01:09:32,647 --> 01:09:37,218
Payback for the night you
and your friends called my house.

692
01:09:37,818 --> 01:09:41,590
<i>Mrs. Kolbein? This is the police,
ma'am, you need to listen to me.</i>

693
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:43,969
Tell me what's happening.

694
01:09:46,661 --> 01:09:48,276
<i>Please...</i>

695
01:09:48,776 --> 01:09:52,016
- <i>...I can't hear anything.</i>
- <i>We're going in.</i>

696
01:09:52,434 --> 01:09:54,235
<i>No shot! No shot! He has the kid!</i>

697
01:09:54,335 --> 01:09:55,737
No!

698
01:09:55,837 --> 01:10:00,108
<i>Mrs. Kolbein, do not leave that room!
The second suspect is coming for you!</i>

699
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:02,020
<i>Mrs. Kolbein?</i>

700
01:10:04,012 --> 01:10:05,814
<i>Are you still there?</i>

701
01:10:05,914 --> 01:10:07,543
<i>Mrs. Kolbein?</i>

702
01:10:12,386 --> 01:10:13,932
Izzy?

703
01:10:17,225 --> 01:10:18,826
Izzy?

704
01:10:19,397 --> 01:10:20,887
Izzy?

705
01:10:40,315 --> 01:10:41,910
No!

706
01:10:42,584 --> 01:10:44,663
No! No!

707
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:19,988
We never meant to hurt anyone.

708
01:11:20,788 --> 01:11:23,875
- I'm sorry!
- But you did hurt people.

709
01:11:30,482 --> 01:11:33,528
No! Don't kill him, please!

710
01:11:35,637 --> 01:11:39,341
He has to understand. He has to suffer.

711
01:11:39,441 --> 01:11:41,710
The same way I have.

712
01:11:45,146 --> 01:11:46,624
No!

713
01:12:30,058 --> 01:12:32,494
<i>Did you record us having sex?</i>

714
01:12:32,834 --> 01:12:35,970
<i>What we're doing, it's wrong.</i>

715
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:38,566
<i>Did you record us having sex?</i>

716
01:12:38,866 --> 01:12:42,392
<i>What we're doing, it's wrong.</i>

717
01:12:42,492 --> 01:12:44,939
<i>Did you record us having sex?</i>

718
01:12:45,039 --> 01:12:49,377
<i>What we're doing, it's wrong.</i>

719
01:12:49,477 --> 01:12:51,914
<i>Did you record us having sex?</i>

720
01:12:52,714 --> 01:12:55,950
<i>What we're doing, it's wrong.</i>

721
01:14:18,599 --> 01:14:22,215
No, Peyton, no! No!

722
01:14:24,005 --> 01:14:25,594
No!

723
01:14:27,101 --> 01:14:28,634
No!

724
01:14:43,658 --> 01:14:45,075
Drop the weapon!

725
01:14:45,175 --> 01:14:47,650
- Drop the fucking gun, right now!
- No!

726
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:52,800
I'm only gonna say it one more time,
drop the fucking gun!

727
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:56,004
We have the suspect!
I repeat, we have the suspect!

728
01:14:56,104 --> 01:14:57,505
We need back-up!

729
01:14:57,605 --> 01:15:01,820
Drop the goddamn gun right now,
you son of a bitch!

730
01:15:15,389 --> 01:15:18,169
<i>We are just receiving
some incredible images...</i>

731
01:15:18,269 --> 01:15:20,461
<i>...from a Los Angeles suburb tonight...</i>

732
01:15:20,561 --> 01:15:23,497
<i>...where police are reporting
a multiple homicide.</i>

733
01:15:23,597 --> 01:15:27,068
<i>18-year-old Sam Fuller,
enraged over an internet video...</i>

734
01:15:27,168 --> 01:15:30,338
<i>...depicting his girlfriend
having sex with his best friend...</i>

735
01:15:30,438 --> 01:15:34,542
<i>...allegedly killed both of them
and one of the victim's parents.</i>

736
01:15:34,642 --> 01:15:37,882
<i>There are also reports of connections
to a double homicide...</i>

737
01:15:37,982 --> 01:15:42,650
<i>...of two further teenagers who may
have played a part in making the film.</i>

738
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:45,431
<i>Details are still emerging, but we...</i>

2
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:05,024
Kryptonite, the ultimate bane to Superman.

3
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,535
If it were only as big as my head.

4
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:13,328
I spent two years and $3 billion
mining outer space...

5
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,870
...and this green grain of rice is
all I have to show for it?

6
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,835
Eh, it's a pretty green.

7
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:26,846
Unless I have enough of it to make
Superman's head explode, Mercy, my dear...

8
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,883
...it's not the kind of green that interests me.

9
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:33,928
LexCorp bleeds millions every time
the Man of Steel...

10
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,724
...thwarts my covert plans to
achieve world domination.

11
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,608
What does he have against
free enterprise, anyway, hmm?

12
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,772
And every day that Superman's
popularity spikes...

13
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,693
...mine drops another rung
down the sewers of Metropolis.

14
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,362
Well, I think you're amazing, Mr. Luthor.

15
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,781
I pay you to think I'm amazing, Mercy.

16
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,075
But market research shows it doesn't matter...

17
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,211
...how much money Lex Luthor
pumps into this economy.

18
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:03,416
People only respond to amazing heroes. Huh.

19
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:08,634
So today LexCorp unveils a new breed of hero.

20
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:14,552
Up, up and away above Metropolis,
to defend our city, our world...

21
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:18,598
<i>...against wayward meteors and alien threats.</i>

22
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:24,228
<i>Because even Superman
can't patrol Earth's orbit 24/7.</i>

23
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,835
The LX7 supercomputer indicates
the bogey may be space debris.

24
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,418
Uh, that debris just hung a hard right toward Earth.

25
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,553
Uh, let's put Lex 9000 to the test.

26
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,863
Velocity is off the charts. Impact in...

27
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,945
I know the when, just give me the where.

28
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:14,157
Uh, here. It's heading straight for us.

29
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,403
Let's get out of here.

30
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,755
Data. Billions of bit streams.

31
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,090
I think I shall help myself.

32
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,363
Brainiac just hijacked Lexlabs.

33
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:36,652
If he's gonna cripple Metropolis
by crashing all our computers like last time...

34
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,163
...whose front page am I gonna read it on first?

35
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:44,247
I'm on it, chief. Just need to make a pit stop.

36
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,173
Uh, but my hands are still Wet, Ms. Lane.

37
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,680
Dry them on your socks
and grab your camera, Jimmy.

38
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:01,389
If Kent beats us to another scoop,
I've officially lost my mojo.

39
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,277
Buckle up.

40
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:23,624
Mr. Luthor, sir.
Brainiac just crash-landed at Lexlabs.

41
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:27,503
But Lex 9000...

42
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,164
Shall I fetch the limo?

43
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,623
Brainiac.

44
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,969
It's time to log off.

45
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,429
But I hunger for knowledge, son of Krypton.

46
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:26,061
And knowledge is power.

47
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,900
You may want to attend to that.

48
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:53,213
Whoa. He's going the other way, Ms. Lane.
What are we gonna do?

49
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,967
Get another angle on things.

50
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,769
Why can't you be more like Kent?

51
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,402
He never whines.
Heck, half the time, I don't even know he's here.

52
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,827
You better get the fear.
Be a real newsman, or there's the door.

53
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,165
Huh.

54
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:52,226
Oh, Ms. Lane, you know something
bad's gonna happen.

55
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:56,019
Why do you always have to
put yourself in these situations?

56
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,485
He's why, Jimmy.

57
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,576
Upload complete.

58
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:14,290
Another small step in my evolution
toward becoming the ultimate intellect.

59
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:19,879
And information is most valuable
if I am the only one who possesses it.

60
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,220
Were the only one.

61
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,189
Nice try, son of Krypton...

62
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:40,191
...but I am now equipped to go one better.

63
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,741
It may not be kryptonite...

64
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,335
...but its power cannot be denied.

65
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,744
I am so happy...

66
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,039
No, wait.

67
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,537
- I'm sad.
- Sir?

68
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,924
Lex 9000 is supposed to bust up meteors,
not Superman.

69
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,088
News of this could ruin me.

70
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,804
Well, can't beat ringside.

71
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,219
Mercy, microwave some popcorn.

72
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,718
Oh, boy.

73
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,947
Ms. Lane!

74
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,017
Help! Help!

75
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,244
How ironic. Brought to your knees by a device...

76
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,952
...intended to drive the likes of me away.

77
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,583
With you deleted, son of Krypton...

78
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:07,336
...nothing can stop me from draining
your planet dry of all its data.

79
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,338
<i>Help! Help!</i>

80
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:14,970
I think I shall enjoy hurtling humankind
back to the Dark Ages.

81
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,350
Ooh. Brain freeze.

82
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,429
Ms. Lane, you really need to be more careful.

83
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,429
You always catch me when I fall, Superman.

84
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:10,817
Besides, how else am I supposed to
get to know you better?

85
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,147
Brainiac and Lex 9000 made quite a team.

86
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:19,159
They were yay close to offing
the big blue boy scout.

87
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,070
Until Superman brained Brainiac.

88
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,921
Or did he?

89
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,014
Please, please, shoot my good side.

90
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,140
Didn't know you had one.

91
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,926
TouchÃ©, Lane.

92
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,352
Welcome, Superman.

93
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:58,322
I'd offer you a latte, but Brainiac seems to
have busted up our refreshment station.

94
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:02,531
Mr. Luthor, care to comment about
the operation of your so-called meteor buster?

95
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,788
Hey, hey, hey, I just build the stuff.

96
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:11,044
How intergalactic scum choose to use it is
another matter. Isn't that right, Superman?

97
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:14,923
If it had done its job
and shot down Brainiac in the first place...

98
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,175
...we wouldn't be having this conversation.

99
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,710
Oh, pshaw.

100
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,675
New technology always requires fine-tuning.

101
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:28,470
But the real question is,
who's gonna pay for this mess?

102
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:32,311
Thanks to you, Superman,
Brainiac's in no condition to cut me a check.

103
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,857
Nope, no signs of life here.

104
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:46,204
Kent, you're one heck of a journalist,
maybe my best.

105
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,581
You meet deadlines without breaking a sweat...

106
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:52,039
...and without putting yourself
in harm's way like Lane.

107
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,495
I'm not sure how you pull it off.

108
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:59,259
Well, guess I just keep my eye on the story
and my fingers on the typewriter keys.

109
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:03,422
Kent, I wish you'd reconsider my offer
to be our foreign correspondent.

110
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:06,592
Branch out. It's the <i>Daily Planet</i>, after all.

111
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,475
Oh, I don't know, Mr. White.

112
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:12,104
I'd hate being so far away
from home base, from the gang.

113
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,890
What are you, in kindergarten?

114
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:18,778
I suggest you worry about being far from home
when you decide to settle down.

115
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,330
Whoa.

116
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,792
- Mercy.
- Nice collection you got there, Jimmy.

117
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,169
Which do you recommend I use for my story?

118
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,881
Um... This one's my favorite.

119
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,714
Get over her, Jimmy. She'd eat you alive.

120
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,345
Sarah's really more your speed.

121
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,013
Sarah? That geek?

122
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,514
We don't have anything in common.

123
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,179
You both work for the newspaper.

124
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,144
- She's the food critic.
- Free meals.

125
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,149
You'd never have to pick up the check.

126
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,606
I like cheeseburgers and chili fries.

127
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,692
She likes chichi.

128
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,407
It's her job to like chichi.

129
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,614
You know what they say, Jimmy:
Beauty isn't skin-deep.

130
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,866
Look who's talking,
Miss Only-Has-Eyes-for-Superman.

131
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,957
I won't deny there's something about
a flying man in tights that gets me tingly...

132
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,755
...but when you look into someone's eyes
and get that connected feeling...

133
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:26,012
...like somehow you've always known them...

134
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,764
...that's when you know it's right.

135
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,469
So, Jimmy, get past the glasses, huh?

136
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,978
Hey, uh, someone mention chili fries?

137
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,189
Uh, yeah, about four hours ago.

138
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:45,232
Well, you two have fun.
I have a Superman story to finish.

139
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,863
Check out my snaps, Mr. K.

140
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,698
Mercy may Work for the dark side...

141
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,865
...but I think that just adds to her dangerous allure.

142
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:58,457
I wouldn't know, Jimmy.
She's not exactly my type.

143
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,480
Hello, anyone home?

144
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,033
<i>What? Where am I?</i>

145
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,320
Oh. I was hoping his first words would be "Dada."

146
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,159
Where are you?

147
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,953
And Lex Luthor gave him sight.

148
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,751
- Lex Luthor?
- In the flesh.

149
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:49,090
<i>I know of you through my...
...Acquisition of knowledge...</i>

150
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,257
...through my patented Lexlabs
supercomputer, yada, yada, yada.

151
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:57,771
<i>Your tone conveys a familiarity
that has not yet been earned, Lex Luthor.</i>

152
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,556
You know, it's just that kind of braggadocio...

153
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,067
...that got you brained to bits in the first place.

154
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,946
By the son of Krypton, yes.

155
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,816
I'm feeling the love here. Are you?

156
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,952
Brainy, babe, you and I are both muy simpatico.

157
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,363
We're both into the world-domination thing...

158
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,955
...and we both despise
the superpowered boy scout of Metropolis.

159
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,461
<i>If you have a point, make it.</i>

160
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,794
I can provide you with the ultimate opportunity...

161
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:30,132
- ...to annihilate Superman.
- <i>And in return?</i>

162
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:34,299
You allow me to publicly avenge the Man of Steel.

163
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:39,475
Put on a big show, playing hero,
chase you from Earth.

164
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,561
Then you take over some other world far away...

165
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,442
...and leave the domination of this one to me.

166
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,777
- We both live happily ever after.
- The end.

167
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,236
<i>We make strange allies, Lex Luthor.</i>

168
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:59,033
<i>But giving up Earth is small sacrifice
for ridding the galaxies of my mortal enemy.</i>

169
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,997
Let's rebuild you, partner.

170
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,628
<i>I am a biotechnic entity.</i>

171
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:08,007
<i>All that I require is proximity to technology...</i>

172
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,418
<i>...to incorporate into my very being.</i>

173
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:15,010
Hey, I didn't mean to step on any proverbial toes.

174
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,890
But if that's the case...

175
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,892
...I suggest that we incorporate you...

176
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,554
...with something other than
a toaster oven this time.

177
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,849
Something with a little more...

178
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,891
...muscle.

179
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,073
Clark, is something troubling you?

180
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,734
You hardly touched your chicken and dumplings.

181
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,198
Yeah, you usually have at least six helpings.

182
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,238
I'm watching my carbs, Morn.

183
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,079
Well, we're sure glad you flew home
for the weekend, son.

184
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,744
Since you've been in Metropolis, we barely see you.

185
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,878
Figured it was work keeping you busy.

186
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,380
Or a lady. Unh.

187
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,884
- Any thoughts about settling clown?
- On Earth?

188
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,089
Oh, I'm here to stay.

189
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:02,429
Lois has been on my mind. Again.

190
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,856
Oh. How are things, you know, going with her?

191
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,143
As Superman? Dandy.

192
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,607
But she can't seem to look Clark Kent in the eye.

193
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,693
Well, maybe it's the spectacles.

194
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,654
Ever consider getting
that new-fangled laser surgery?

195
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,160
Heh. He doesn't need glasses.

196
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,993
Right, right, x-ray vision. I knew that.

197
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:24,750
Look, Lois is a crack reporter. Best there is.

198
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,038
It's only a matter of time
before she gets past the glasses...

199
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,627
...sees through my disguise.

200
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,259
I'm concerned she won't ever trust me...

201
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,761
...or Superman again.

202
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,885
I need to tell Lois the truth.

203
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,096
So, what's keeping you, Clark?

204
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,511
- You got our support.
- Mm.

205
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:50,439
I have powerful enemies who would give
anything to find my Weak spot.

206
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:53,730
If any one of them were to discover
what Lois might learn...

207
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,115
...that Clark Kent is Superman...

208
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:59,698
Well, I can't knowingly put Lois...

209
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,455
...put anyone I care about, in that kind of danger.

210
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,835
Son, we know you're Superman, and we're just fine.

211
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,916
Clark, if there's one thing we've learned
since being blessed with you...

212
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:17,462
...a risk is worth taking if it's for love.

213
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,316
Since you've already hijacked
Lex 9000 once on your own...

214
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,355
...I have an automatic alibi.

215
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,524
You just build the stuff. Heh.

216
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,068
<i>Enough dallying.</i>

217
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:43,864
<i>My biotechnic-grafting process
requires an incubation period.</i>

218
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,872
Hold your horses, Brainy.

219
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,331
We have a couple of extras for your travel kit. One:

220
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,995
<i>Kryptonite.</i>

221
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:54,165
A smidgen, but who knows?

222
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,254
Combined with your new firepower...

223
00:22:56,417 --> 00:23:00,138
...it might be just enough to kick things up a notch.

224
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:01,548
<i>And second?</i>

225
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,342
We took a swab off your shiny little dome...

226
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,181
...and guess what turned up.

227
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,390
Your IQ.

228
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:19,107
Seems Super-Duperman clocked you so hard...

229
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:22,072
...he left a little something
for you to remember him by.

230
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,738
A strand of DNA.

231
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:30,285
<i>With the Kryptonian's DNA,
I can lock on to his energy signature...</i>

232
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,920
<i>...track him wherever he may be.</i>

233
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,582
That's right, partner. Heh.

234
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,878
Superman may run faster than a speeding bullet...

235
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:42,843
...but he can't hide.

236
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,986
See you at Superman's funeral.

237
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,701
- Night.
- Hasta la vista.

238
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,988
See you in the a.m.

239
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:32,949
Not so fast.

240
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,163
Kent, need you to cover for Sarah tonight.

241
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,577
She just called in sick.

242
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:39,042
Lovesick. Ha, ha.

243
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,047
No, ate some bad clams.

244
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,834
You'll be reviewing Lamont Laboe's new hot spot.

245
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,922
Ooh. TrÃ¨s chichi.

246
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,636
But, Perry,
I don't know the first thing about how to...

247
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:53,723
Lane, the reservation's for two. Help the man out.

248
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,980
Hungry?

249
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:32,892
Once again, I am reborn.

250
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,741
- I didn't know it was gonna be so...
- Dark?

251
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,411
Welcome to Le Chateau Laboe...

252
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,167
...the most romantic
dining experience in Metropolis.

253
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,829
Are we celebrating an anniversary tonight?

254
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,960
Honeymooning?

255
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,508
Ah, dating.

256
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:10,547
- Um, heh, actually, we're, uh...
- Critics.

257
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,682
So let's keep things professional, huh?

258
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,888
Mm.

259
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:23,275
I love to dine surrounded by beauty.

260
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:28,322
After I make a show of mopping up Brainiac
with one of my patented Lexosuits...

261
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,609
...I'll be the new boy scout of Metropolis.

262
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:35,530
And the military will finally beg
to pay you top dollar for them.

263
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:38,495
Hmm. You're learning, Mercy.

264
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,876
Now, parmesan, por favor.

265
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:45,505
Sir, mission control
has lost all contact with Lex 9000.

266
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,587
It vanished.

267
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,052
It's showtime.

268
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,090
Well, no, no, I'm sure...

269
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:02,481
- Ew.
- Calamari not your thing, Smallville?

270
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,810
Ha, ha. I'm 100 percent corn-fed.

271
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,944
If it's not Mom's chicken and dumplings...

272
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,105
Well, I'm glad there's squid on the table.

273
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,650
My pen just ran out of ink.

274
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:19,874
You know, Lois, I never pegged you
for such a romantic.

275
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:25,333
I mean, with Jimmy. Playing matchmaker and all.

276
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,793
I just hate seeing people miss opportunities.

277
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:31,005
Life's too short, you know What I mean?

278
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,678
I think I'm starting to.

279
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,010
So I meddle in Olsen's affairs.

280
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:39,302
What's your story, Kent? Seeing anyone?

281
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:45,521
I'm waiting for a special someone
to take notice of me.

282
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:49,107
Kent, Why so mild-mannered?

283
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,364
You shouldn't be afraid
to tell a girl What's on your mind.

284
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:56,652
I mean, you're kind, intelligent...

285
00:28:56,818 --> 00:29:00,322
...good-looking, well built...

286
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:09,624
What is it, Lois?

287
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,087
For a moment, you...

288
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,637
...reminded me of someone I know, that's all.

289
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,534
Lois, this is hard for me.

290
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:41,163
Maybe harder than anything I've ever had to say.

291
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,245
But there's something I need to tell you.

292
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:47,082
Son of Krypton.

293
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,372
Yes, Clark?

294
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,132
You have something right here.

295
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,335
Oh.

296
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,846
- Son of Krypton.
- I'm here, Brainiac.

297
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,975
Clark? Clark?

298
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:24,574
I have been keeping pace
with current trends in technology.

299
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,085
And I have upgraded with one goal in mind:

300
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,870
your destruction.

301
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,963
Chief, trust me.
This is one restaurant review...

302
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,970
...you'll want plastered on the front page.

303
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,722
All I need is my ace photographer.

304
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,978
Hey, wait a sec.

305
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,138
Technology.

306
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,483
Enemy engaged.

307
00:31:55,997 --> 00:32:00,173
You cannot hide from me, son of Krypton.

308
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:09,308
The more I try to resist him, the weaker I become.

309
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:15,935
This time, son of Krypton, I possess brawn as well as brain.

310
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,008
Huh?

311
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,265
Oh, no.

312
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,508
Ms. Lane.

313
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,473
Lois. Lois.

314
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:32,470
Superman, I...

315
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,350
...should be more careful.

316
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,120
We're doing everything we can
to keep her comfortable.

317
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:42,415
She can be comfortable at home, doc.

318
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,003
What's her condition?

319
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,255
We're still running tests, but...

320
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,420
...her blood cells seem to be fusing...

321
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,965
...with traces of metal alloy.

322
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:55,102
As if she's being galvanized from the inside out.

323
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,888
We've called in specialists, but...

324
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:01,809
...if Ms. Lane's blood
continues to mutate at this rate...

325
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:03,397
...she hasn't much time.

326
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:37,268
Superman.

327
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,354
He didn't save her this time, Mr. Kent.

328
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,390
Superman didn't save her.

329
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,067
I need to go away for a while, Jimmy.

330
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,446
But I promise you...

331
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:53,611
...Superman will do everything
in his power to save Lois.

332
00:35:57,364 --> 00:36:00,618
Was quite a slugfest
at the new fondue joint last night.

333
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,786
But I'm not sure which I find more tragic:

334
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,796
Superman's corpse
failing to turn up in the rubble...

335
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:08,253
...or Lane's little mishap.

336
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:12,137
Maybe she'll think twice next time
she decides to snoop in your business.

337
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,844
If there's a next time.

338
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,759
Hmm. Mercy, send flowers.

339
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,179
We could use the PR.

340
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:06,767
<i>Welcome to your Fortress of Solitude, Kal-El.</i>

341
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:12,190
Lois has been harmed, and it's my fault.

342
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,699
Brainiac knew I was at the restaurant.

343
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:17,281
Which means he's either discovered my identity...

344
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:19,446
...or a Way of tracking me.

345
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,874
<i>Then I must question the wisdom
in your coming here, Kal-El.</i>

346
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:26,036
<i>All of Krypton's secrets could be compromised.</i>

347
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,375
I need to save Lois.

348
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:30,006
Nothing else matters.

349
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:33,715
And this is the one time neither my speed
nor my strength can help her.

350
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:37,381
<i>My analysis of Ms. Lane's condition is complete.</i>

351
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:42,144
<i>Most curiously, I have detected a faint trace
of kryptonite in her bloodstream.</i>

352
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,437
That would explain my weakness.

353
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:49,147
<i>Ms. Lane is suffering from a highly
concentrated form of blood-alloy fusion.</i>

354
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:51,107
What will it take to cure her?

355
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,988
<i>There is no earthly cure.</i>

356
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:57,697
<i>- There does exist a rare substance.</i>
<i>- Where do I find it?</i>

357
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:02,907
<i>Only one place. The Phantom Zone.</i>

358
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:22,976
I must go there.

359
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:25,641
<i>I had expected that, Kal-El.</i>

360
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,602
<i>But listen carefully.</i>

361
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,729
<i>Though the Phantom Zone is prison...</i>

362
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,770
<i>...to the most dangerous criminals
in all the galaxies...</i>

363
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:36,236
<i>...they will not present
the greatest threat to you within it.</i>

364
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:39,359
I'm prepared to fend off any of its attacks.

365
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:42,279
<i>Once inside, remain intently focused...</i>

366
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:45,449
<i>...and above all, accomplish your mission swiftly.</i>

367
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,743
<i>For the longer you remain in the Zone...</i>

368
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,628
<i>...the more vulnerable you will be to its effects...</i>

369
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:54,417
<i>...and the more difficult it will become
for you to find your way back.</i>

370
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:59,258
<i>The substance which you seek
lies at the heart of the Phantom Zone.</i>

371
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,263
<i>Argonium 44.</i>

372
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,595
<i>Be sure to obtain enough of it.</i>

373
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,681
<i>As well as cure Ms. Lane...</i>

374
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:09,223
<i>...Argonium 44 may also serve to shield you...</i>

375
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:12,893
<i>from Brainiac's form of modified kryptonite.</i>

376
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,150
You cannot hide from me.

377
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,007
So this is your sanctuary.

378
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:57,357
Data. Kryptonian data.

379
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,365
The mother lode.

380
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,659
Billions of bits...

381
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:07,368
...from the great minds of the extinct planet Krypton.

382
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,749
I shall drain it dry.

383
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:16,877
The computer only responds to my DNA.

384
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:23,130
<i>Welcome to your Fortress of Solitude, Kal-El.</i>

385
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,390
Yes, it does.

386
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:30,224
This ends here, with us.

387
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,143
DNA recognition override.

388
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:35,604
<i>Self-destruct mode commenced.</i>

389
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,610
<i>Twelve. 11...</i>

390
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:43,492
No, you would not.
All the knowledge of your civilization, lost?

391
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,324
Better lost than abused.

392
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:51,162
- ...four, three, two, one.
- No!

393
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,768
No energy signature.

394
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:16,024
At least the son of Krypton is no more.

395
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:45,799
I got one heck of a case of food poisoning.

396
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:49,011
Last time I eat outwith Clark.

397
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,801
Where is Clark?

398
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,191
Mercy, it's beginning to feel
like somewhere in the world...

399
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,943
...Superman may be history.

400
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:49,071
Break out the tiki torches. We're throwing a luau.

401
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:54,369
And be sure to invite
all our favorite members of the press.

402
00:42:56,949 --> 00:43:01,204
So here I work on Kent for a year
to be my foreign correspondent...

403
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,464
...and he picks now to take the job.

404
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,216
Then I don't hear boo from him...

405
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,923
...and for the first time ever, he misses a deadline.

406
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:11,180
Oh. Still can't reach him.

407
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,558
Maybe his cell can't roam in Uzbekistan.

408
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:18,722
I can't figure Why Kent isn't here,
with Lane laid up the way she is.

409
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:21,437
Not to mention Superman.

410
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:25,566
Olsen, you thinking what I'm thinking?

411
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:30,282
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

412
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,910
Mr. Kent hasn't been too forthcoming.

413
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,663
It's obvious now.

414
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:39,497
Kent only took the foreign assignment
to get away from here.

415
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:42,128
From the pain of seeing Lane this way.

416
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,631
She must really mean a lot to him.

417
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:27,837
Hang on just a little longer, Lois.

418
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:46,985
What the...?

419
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,823
Olsen, why are you still here?

420
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:55,485
Because you told me not to hover
around the hospital.

421
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,494
Gotta give the doctors room to work.

422
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,073
Well, you gotta get your mind off this.

423
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,082
Gotta do something with yourself.

424
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:05,415
Okay, I'll go to the hospital.

425
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:07,922
No. Look, kid.

426
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,209
I really should have a reporter
at the Luthor shindig tonight.

427
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:14,629
- You go.
- But I'm a photographer.

428
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,547
Well, I'm short-staffed.

429
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,968
My ace newshounds are either overseas...

430
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,303
...or on their deathbeds.

431
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,104
I'll report anything you want me to report,
Mr. White.

432
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:31,146
It just won't be Ms. Lane's obit,
because she's gonna be all right.

433
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:34,274
You know she's gonna be all right.

434
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:27,956
- Clark?
- Yes.

435
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,917
Yes, Lois.

436
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:34,254
You mean, you...?

437
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:15,500
Thank you all for coming.

438
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:19,887
- You cut quite a rug, Senator Marquez.
- Ha, ha.

439
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:22,515
Try the fiesta dip, Mrs. Mayor.

440
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,926
It'll put hair on your back. Ha, ha.

441
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:31,140
Is this thing on'? Ahem.

442
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:34,186
Now, the new reports are true.

443
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,108
LexCorp's had a run of rough luck recently.

444
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,945
Heck, we can't even locate half our satellites.

445
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:45,371
But I want to state for the public record...

446
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:50,126
...that my company will never cease
in its mission to devote all its resources...

447
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:54,005
...to the goodwill of Lexopolis...
Uh, Metropolis. Heh.

448
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,635
Huh?

449
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,748
<i>Do not resist, mortals.</i>

450
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,535
<i>I now control all transmissions.</i>

451
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:37,207
<i>Metropolis belongs to Brainiac.</i>

452
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,879
And no sign of Superman.

453
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:46,925
I guess it's time to try on a new suit.

454
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:50,265
Downtown Metropolis has come under attack!

455
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,935
Well, where is the Man of Steel
when you most need him?

456
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:57,314
Allow me to put my money where my mouth is.

457
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:01,231
Members of the press,
I suggest you grab your cameras...

458
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:03,240
...and meet me downtown in five.

459
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:10,244
Okay. Okay, Olsen, you're a reporter.

460
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:13,080
So, what would Ms. Lane do?

461
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:16,872
Get another angle on things.

462
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:25,922
Well, our big-brained alien ally
couldn't have timed that better.

463
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:30,889
Now Luthorman smacks him down
while the world watches.

464
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:35,435
Get ready for your close-up, Mr. Luthor.

465
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:38,693
Luther's working with Brainiac?

466
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:41,229
What would Ms. Lane do'?

467
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:44,611
Find proof.

468
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,998
My mind is so blown.

469
00:49:57,161 --> 00:50:00,335
I'm alive, with you.

470
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,926
Lois, take it easy. You're still weak.

471
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:08,931
You always catch me when I fall, Clark Kent.

472
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,342
It makes total sense.

473
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:14,763
I'm such a fool for not seeing it.

474
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:19,059
And for not ever imagining
I'd be pressing my lips to yours...

475
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:21,398
...before Superman's.

476
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,565
Heh. I'm, uh, not sure it's the right time, Lois.

477
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:29,235
Gotcha. You're thinking romantic setting.

478
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:32,450
Say, a candlelit table back at Le Chateau?

479
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:36,538
Lois, now that I know you're safe,
I need to stop Brainiac.

480
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,328
He could find me again, find us.

481
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:41,964
Clark, you said so yourself:

482
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,170
Brainiac thinks Superman is dead.

483
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:47,928
We're both safe, as long as we leave it that way.

484
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:53,344
I'm willing to live without Superman
as long as I have you...

485
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:56,183
...the man behind the glasses.

486
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:58,439
It's not only us, Lois.

487
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:01,567
All of Metropolis is in danger, our entire planet.

488
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,978
If I don't stop Brainiac, who will?

489
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:07,899
Special Ops, Navy SEALS, that Green Lantern guy.

490
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,155
Somethings not right.

491
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,116
Everything is right. Don't you see'?

492
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:17,204
I'm here, Clark, with you, just like you wanted.

493
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:21,587
You wouldn't know what I wanted,
not unless I told you or unless...

494
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,373
This isn't Metropolis.

495
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:27,130
I never left.

496
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:30,296
No, wait.

497
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,681
Unh. Clark, don't leave me!

498
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,218
You're not Lois, you're a phantom.

499
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:38,308
Lois is still in Metropolis.

500
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,043
We've done everything We can.

501
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,555
I don't expect her to last the hour.

502
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,143
Hey, lamebrain!

503
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,652
Leave planet Earth now...

504
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,531
...or feel the might of the new Man of Steel.

505
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:31,781
Look!

506
00:52:37,446 --> 00:52:39,949
I destroyed Superman.

507
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:44,040
Destroying you, Lex Luthor, will be a snap.

508
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:49,508
Ooh. He really milks the drama.

509
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:52,796
You're going down, clown!

510
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,593
Come on!

511
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,156
Spread out.

512
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:23,034
Appreciate the Method acting, but go easy, fella.

513
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,747
Bad back.

514
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:30,041
Acting? Did you really think I would ever
hand Earth over to you, Luthor?

515
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,835
Well, actually, Brainy, no.

516
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:36,131
So remember those goodies
I packed into your shuttle?

517
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:41,848
I threw in a little hidden Easter egg called
"self-destruct mechanism."

518
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:45,264
So nice working with you.

519
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,397
Huh? Huh?

520
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:52,651
You underestimate my intelligence.

521
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:57,990
My biotechnics located your mechanism,
which I deactivated.

522
00:53:58,152 --> 00:53:59,404
Oh, boy.

523
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:03,666
Now I shall deactivate you.

524
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:05,083
Ow!

525
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,924
Come on, get enough coverage, Olsen.

526
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,835
There's bound to be something incriminating here.

527
00:54:58,212 --> 00:54:59,589
This area is restricted.

528
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:03,976
I was just, uh, looking for the little boys' room.

529
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,351
The film.

530
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:09,186
I'm sorry, you'll have to speak to Mr.
White about that.

531
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:12,227
<i>Editor in chief of the Daily Planet?</i>

532
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:15,696
Hmm. You know something, newsboy?

533
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,276
You're kind of cute.

534
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:19,157
I... I am?

535
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,989
Too bad I have to break you.

536
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:38,339
- Look!
- Up in the sky!

537
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:41,005
It's Superman!

538
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,718
Yay.

539
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:49,141
What?

540
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:57,734
The son of Krypton lives?

541
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,148
But how?

542
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,487
Long story, Brainiac.

543
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:04,244
One I don't have time to share.

544
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,953
Give me that film!

545
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:47,764
Huh?

546
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:51,765
Oh, no! Aah!

547
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,174
Rooting for you, my man.

548
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,517
No!

549
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:14,281
Superman!

550
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,828
The reactor's gonna blow!

551
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:15,584
You want your camera, newsboy?

552
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,593
Come and get it.

553
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:44,905
Fun dancing with you, Mercy.

554
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:50,244
But I will take my camera, thank you.

555
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:58,885
Oh! Oh, man.

556
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:12,292
Whoa. Whoa!

557
01:05:30,385 --> 01:05:32,558
Good game, Supey.

558
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,473
You and I make strange allies, but...

559
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:48,244
In any event, how lucky
for the original Man of Steel...

560
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:52,579
...that my patented Lexosuit
softened up Brainiac for him, huh? Huh?

561
01:05:57,745 --> 01:05:59,088
Oh. Huh?

562
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:34,871
So that is what provides
the son of Krypton with newfound power.

563
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:36,455
No!

564
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:20,124
She fought bravely, Superman...

565
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:23,461
...but there's no more time.

566
01:08:09,544 --> 01:08:11,421
Clark?

567
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:17,435
No, Lois.

568
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:21,849
It's me, Superman.

569
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:49,884
<i>Welcome to your Fortress of Solitude, Kal-El.</i>

570
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:52,387
<i>That is, what remains of it.</i>

571
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:55,389
I'll rebuild it, with your help.

572
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,425
<i>And Ms. Lane?</i>

573
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,928
A clean bill of health.

574
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:04,315
Though I came close, too close, to losing her.

575
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:08,152
It's best for her safety if I keep my distance.

576
01:09:08,311 --> 01:09:09,904
It's best for Lois...

577
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:13,904
<i>...if Clark Kent retires from the Daily Planet.</i>

578
01:09:16,194 --> 01:09:19,323
Sure, I got a little banged up...

579
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:25,337
...but self-sacrifice comes with the territory
when you're Metropolis' protector.

580
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:30,083
Uh, me and Superman, that is. Heh.

581
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:34,880
In fact, you might say I'm Superman's pal.

582
01:09:35,046 --> 01:09:38,220
Actually, I believe that honor belongs
to Jimmy Olsen of the Planet.

583
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:41,478
What about reports that your bodyguard
assaulted the Olsen kid?

584
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:42,933
He was trespassing.

585
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:45,272
Poor girl thought he was a burglar.

586
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:48,776
Another thing, Mr. Luthor.
This was found within Brainiac's remains.

587
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:51,609
The LexCorp logo is inscribed on its underside.

588
01:09:51,771 --> 01:09:53,364
Do you care to comment?

589
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:58,657
Mercy, phone my attorneys.

590
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:07,420
All of them.

591
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:11,545
Told you Mercy would eat you alive.

592
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:14,382
Yeah, she's a real tiger.

593
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:18,174
I failed you, Mr. White. I didn't get the story.

594
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:20,467
Well, stick to photography, Olsen.

595
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:24,558
I got one of my ace newshounds back.

596
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:26,935
Hey, what about lunch?

597
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:30,060
I think you're covered, Jimmy.

598
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:37,283
I heard you like cheeseburgers and chili fries.

599
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:40,366
Yeah. You betcha.

600
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:42,781
Where is your other ace newshound, anyway?

601
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:45,200
It's not that he didn't wanna be here, Lois.

602
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,415
You know, chief, the thing about Clark...

603
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:51,798
...you hardly notice him when he's around.
But when he's not...

604
01:10:55,293 --> 01:11:00,140
- Clark!
- I, uh, came as soon as I could, Lois.

605
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:02,471
Guess I missed all the excitement.

606
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:08,106
It's good to see you, Clark.

607
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:14,941
White.

608
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,482
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

609
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:20,026
Kent, you're back not a moment too soon.

610
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:24,915
Seems some superpowered imp
calling himself Mr. Mxyz... Mxyz...

611
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:26,494
Aw, whatever he's called.

612
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:30,082
He's causing some kind of cockamamie
topsy-turvy down at the Wharf.

613
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:33,248
Mr. White... Uh, Perry...

614
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:34,916
...this is hard for me.

615
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:37,756
Maybe harder than almost anything
I've ever had to say.

616
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:39,136
It's about my job.

617
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:42,469
The reason I returned was to let you know that...

618
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,012
...I don't think I can work...

619
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:47,432
Lane?

620
01:11:47,595 --> 01:11:49,313
I'm on it, chief.

621
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:58,656
The wharf. And step on it.

622
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,286
Lane sure lives dangerously.

623
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:06,118
Yes.

624
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:08,658
Yes, she does.

625
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:10,998
Whether I'm around or not.

626
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,709
So, Kent, about the job?

627
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:16,090
You don't think you can what?

628
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:19,506
Don't think I can be
your foreign correspondent, Perry.

629
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:21,671
I was really homesick.

630
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:25,595
We missed you too, Kent.

631
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:28,310
I think Lois will be just fine...

632
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:32,940
...as long as Superman and Clark Kent
are around to look out for her.

633
01:12:33,305 --> 01:13:33,852

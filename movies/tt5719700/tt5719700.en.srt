00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:48,814
<i>I was born in the summer of 1977
in Los Angeles, California.</i>

3
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:52,418
<i>My father, John Kinney, received the
news of my birth two days later</i>

4
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,487
<i>when a telegram reached him
on the Greek island of Mykonos,</i>

5
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,189
<i>where he was directing a film.</i>

6
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:59,525
<i>He said it had
just started raining,</i>

7
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:02,428
<i>and the telegram arrived sopping
wet and written in Greek.</i>

8
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,830
<i>The film's camera operator
translated.</i>

9
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:08,233
<i>"Congratulations!
She's six pounds, 12 ounces,</i>

10
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,235
<i>and her name is Alice."</i>

11
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,704
<i>I'm told so much champagne
popped that night</i>

12
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,239
<i>it sounded like fireworks.</i>

13
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:26,685
<i>My father made personal films that
captured the spirit of his generation.</i>

14
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,353
<i>He found the truth
in the bedroom,</i>

15
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:30,222
<i>the agony in love,</i>

16
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:31,957
<i>and the humor in it all.</i>

17
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,260
<i>In my father's obituary,</i>

18
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,796
<i>the</i> New York times
<i>called him a "comic poet,"</i>

19
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:42,067
<i>a sentiment, I assure you, no one
would have loved more than him.</i>

20
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:46,438
<i>My dad's work brought him
great joy, respect and success.</i>

21
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,374
<i>And with that success,
he bought this car</i>

22
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:52,544
<i>and this house, where I lived every
other weekend of my childhood.</i>

23
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,883
<i>My dad's personal life
was a little less of a success.</i>

24
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:00,786
<i>He married several women.</i>

25
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:03,122
<i>And lived with several more.</i>

26
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:07,526
<i>But he was the first to admit the end of
his affairs was always entirely his fault.</i>

27
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,897
<i>This was certainly the case
with his last wife,</i>

28
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:13,532
<i>my beautiful mother, Lilian.</i>

29
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:18,003
<i>My mother was 22 years old
when she met my dad,</i>

30
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,772
<i>which made her
26 years his junior.</i>

31
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:24,143
<i>Theirs was a real "hold on
to your hat" kind of love,</i>

32
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:26,411
<i>a love that would never last.</i>

33
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:31,316
<i>My parents divorced
soon after my fourth birthday.</i>

34
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,585
<i>Unfortunately for my mother,</i>

35
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,587
<i>this inspired some
of my dad's best work.</i>

36
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,091
<i>But he said it was me</i>

37
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:41,193
<i>who completed his third act.</i>

38
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:44,930
<i>My dad wasn't very sentimental,
but he always loved my birthday.</i>

39
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:47,099
<i>Every year,
he'd say the same thing.</i>

40
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,434
<i>"This is your day.
Your year.</i>

41
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:53,472
<i>Get ready, Alice.
The future is yours."</i>

42
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,116
- Mom?
- Mom, are you in there?

43
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:05,851
Yeah, just a sec.

44
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,788
Mom, remember the drought!

45
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,623
Oh, yeah.

46
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,794
- Mom, open up!
- Open the door!

47
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:16,962
I'm coming.

48
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,232
Happy birthday!

49
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh, my gosh, you guys.

50
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,403
Come here. Mmm.

51
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:26,171
Mom, is everything okay?

52
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:28,173
Yeah. I'm great.

53
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:31,510
It's my birthday.
And I love you both so much.

54
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:32,811
Okay, who wants pancakes?

55
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,546
I do!
I do!

56
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,216
So, girls, how are we feeling?

57
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:39,685
First day, new school.
You nervous? You excited?

58
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,153
Excited. Definitely.

59
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:42,821
Nervous. Extremely.

60
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,524
Wait. Can kids
have heart attacks?

61
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:48,260
Oh, my gosh, honey, no.
But I understand.

62
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:51,396
This is a big deal. Do you want
to listen to your favorite song?

63
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,198
Or maybe we
could go over your schedule

64
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,600
and talk about
what's making you anxious.

65
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:57,035
I don't wanna do
that doctor's stupid exercises.

66
00:03:57,037 --> 00:04:00,339
Can't I just go on antidepressants
like every other kid?

67
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:02,874
Oh, my god. Isabel. For the billionth
time, you are not depressed.

68
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,676
- I'm positive.
- Please, mom?

69
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:08,080
You know, I'm feeling exhausted,
hopeless, anxious,

70
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:11,016
and I don't enjoy the things
that I once loved.

71
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:12,451
Music, please!

72
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,052
I'm not alone, you know.

73
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,054
Depression affects
over 20 million Americans,

74
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:18,123
and I'm an American, so...

75
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,126
- Where are you getting this from?
- The Zoloft commercial.

76
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,961
Obviously.
Okay, IZ,

77
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,763
you're being
a little bit dramatic.

78
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,765
- You're gonna walk into
first period... -oh, no!

79
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,268
- What? What did you forget?
- My summer reading book report.

80
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,970
Oh, god.
Okay. It's no big deal.

81
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,939
I'm gonna drop you guys
off at school,

82
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,475
and I'll go back to the house and
bring it to you, okay, honey?

83
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,443
- But please try and be more responsible.
- I'm working on it.

84
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,045
Okay.
It's okay.

85
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:42,147
E-mail it to me, and I can
print it out in the library.

86
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:46,752
- See? -Well, assuming I
have time and they let me.

87
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,255
Okay, this is it.

88
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:51,657
Wow!

89
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,825
This is gonna be great.

90
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,595
Look at this. It is so much prettier
than your school in New York.

91
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:59,298
It has trees and sunshine.

92
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,467
Look at that cool mural. Okay,
you want me to walk you in?

93
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,270
- No!
- Got it. Unanimous.

94
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:07,172
All right. Don't forget
that after school,

95
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,241
we're gonna have a little birthday
celebration with ice cream,

96
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:11,677
and then tonight you guys are
sleeping over at Nanna's house.

97
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,845
Can you tell Nanna
I go to bed at 9:00 now?

98
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,947
I think it's 8:45, Missy.

99
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,616
But, yes, I will tell her.

100
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:18,750
Love you.

101
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:20,819
Love you, honey.

102
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,387
Have a good day.
I will.

103
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,489
Hi, welcome.

104
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,657
Hi.

105
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,261
Isabel?

106
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:32,364
You got this. You've got
a great first day outfit.

107
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,499
You're hilarious.
You're brilliant.

108
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,967
You're cool.
You're a city kid.

109
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:37,336
Mom...

110
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,538
You're gonna be great.
I promise.

111
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,273
I guess.

112
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:43,508
But right now,
I just wanna go home.

113
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,778
- It's okay. You're gonna be home before
you know it. -I meant to New York.

114
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,616
Happy birthday, mom.

115
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,151
Thanks, sweetie.

116
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,422
Have fun!

117
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,495
Hollywood boulevard is famous
for the walk of fame.

118
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,897
It has the different stars...
Your payment is late.

119
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:09,000
I hear you. But all we need is another
five hours. Let us keep the stuff here.

120
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:12,137
We'll figure out the money, and we'll
get it to you. It won't be a problem.

121
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,840
I'm not running a charity here.
You have to leave now.

122
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:17,242
Okay. You know what, Rajeesh?
We're talking in circles.

123
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,811
We paid the first two weeks. We didn't
think we'd be here for a third.

124
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,847
But if you give us until
tonight, it's all gonna be good.

125
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,316
Get out. Now! Go!

126
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:26,918
Okay. I have to say I think you
are being incredibly difficult,

127
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,520
maybe even slightly irrational.

128
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,055
What are you doing?
What is that?

129
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,324
So now I am calling the police.
The pol... oh.

130
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:38,330
So? So I gotta get changed
or we're gonna be late.

131
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:40,432
What'd he say? What happened?
He's a maniac.

132
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,234
Indians never like me.
Okay.

133
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,736
Teddy, you packed? Oh, sorry.
Thought you said you had a plan.

134
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,605
- You are looking at it.
- George, enough.

135
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:49,007
We need to focus on our meeting.
Let's go over the pitch.

136
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:52,077
Teddy, should we run lines? I think it could
be good to act out some bits in the room.

137
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,912
I'll play Sam.
You play Jane.

138
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,181
- But I'm playing Sam in the movie.
- Oh. Fine.

139
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:59,684
- I'll play Jane then. -Let's just
make sure we stick to our guns, okay?

140
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,686
I've heard horror stories
about great scripts

141
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,623
getting totally dismantled
by these kinds of people.

142
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,792
Aren't these people who are gonna
help us get our movie made?

143
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:08,860
I've read about it.
It happens.

144
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:12,063
Also, let's agree not to get talked out
of shooting the movie in black and white.

145
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,866
Perfect.
Right?

146
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:18,403
I get it, and I don't need the extra
weird stare. Guys, we're gonna do great.

147
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:20,772
I have a good feeling about this.
Everybody ready to rumble?

148
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,107
Yeah, wait.
Where we gonna stay?

149
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,976
Do I look worried?

150
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:28,547
Alice Kinney
is the principal owner

151
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:31,383
and designer
of Alice Kinney designs.

152
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:33,285
Alice is...

153
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,787
A depressed,

154
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,825
newly separated... loser.

155
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,129
- Hello?
- -<i> There she is.</i>

156
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,465
<i>The California girl.</i>
Hey.

157
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:47,732
How's your birthday going?

158
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,334
It's good, so far.

159
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,503
There's a lot going on. It's
the girls' first day of school.

160
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:53,305
<i>You called them, right?</i>
Uh, hey.

161
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:57,976
I do not need you...
To remind me to do that.

162
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,112
Okay. So you did or you didn't?

163
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,281
They will hear from me
before the end of the day.

164
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,649
<i>Anyway, look.</i>

165
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:08,787
I was calling you
to wish you a very happy 40th.

166
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:11,256
It's fine, right?
It's not as bad as you thought.

167
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:13,325
It's-it's going great so far.

168
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:16,661
I'm very busy. I'm just prepping
for that job interview tomorrow.

169
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,931
Oh, right, yeah, yeah.
Good luck with that.

170
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:25,003
Thanks. Uh, listen, Austen, have you
heard anything about the move here?

171
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,339
Because the girls ask me every single day.
"Is daddy coming?

172
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,107
<i>When's he getting his house?"</i>

173
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,209
<i>I'm kind of running out of answers.</i>
Oh, yeah.

174
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,378
I ask all the time too.

175
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,681
They think they might have found someone
to run things out there. So that's good.

176
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:40,085
<i>Yeah, and once that happens, then
things should all fall into place.</i>

177
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,021
Austen, they're ready for you.

178
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,490
I'll be there in one sec. Alice?

179
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,826
Yeah.
<i>Don't get mad at me</i>

180
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,594
for saying this, but...

181
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,597
I miss you.

182
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,175
My boys. You made it!

183
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,911
Yes!

184
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:08,813
You told us if we were serious
about this, it was la or bust.

185
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,683
- So here we are. -Listen. So sorry I
had to keep pushing this meeting.

186
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:14,653
It's the end of the summer, the Jewish
holiday. This time of year is insane.

187
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:17,722
- No worries at all. -All right.
Good stuff. So here we go. Okay.

188
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,925
Harry Dorsey, Teddy
Dorsey, George Appleton.

189
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:22,727
Director, writer, star of
<i>mad youth,</i> the best short...

190
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,230
You know what? No, the best
film I saw at south by.

191
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,865
Whoa.
Thank you.

192
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,700
Paul hasn't stopped talking
about you since the festival.

193
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,268
I'm Jason. Great to meet you.
I'm Jason too.

194
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,504
Double Jasons. Mind-blowing, yeah.
I know, it's crazy.

195
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:34,239
Let's have a seat, everybody.
Now listen up.

196
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,608
We have some great ideas

197
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,044
about how to turn your short
into a feature.

198
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,246
And, again,
I really did love it.

199
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,748
I saw it again this morning while
I was running on the treadmill.

200
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,017
- It is special. -This is a
breakout role for you, Teddy.

201
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,353
We should get you out on
auditions right away.

202
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:49,721
- Yeah?
- Definitely.

203
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,456
And, George, your writing...

204
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:55,060
Your writing is so spot-on.
I just love that Joan character.

205
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:57,629
I think we've all had a Joan
in our lives, am I right?

206
00:09:57,631 --> 00:10:00,465
- Thanks. It's Jane. -Would you ever
be interested in any episodic work?

207
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:02,033
I mean, yeah.

208
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:06,471
But in terms of our movie,
what's the next move here?

209
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:09,808
Right. Okay. Well, first thing we
need to do is to attach a producer.

210
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,477
And it just so happens
somebody's already interested.

211
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:15,146
I might have slipped your short
to Justin Miller...

212
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,248
And he kinda flipped for it.

213
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,918
- Justin Miller? -Is that the guy who
produces all those horror movies?

214
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,087
He's been looking to do
something a little more human.

215
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:25,557
He's very smart, by the way, and he's done
insanely well off those horror films.

216
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,292
Okay, guys.

217
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,961
He's a big producer. He likes your movie.
This is a good thing.

218
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,797
Definitely. But does he know we
don't have a finished script yet?

219
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,439
Yeah, and that is a great thing, actually, because
Justin wants to develop it with you guys.

220
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,938
And this one here
looks like he wants to kill me.

221
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,173
No, that's just George.

222
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:44,576
Only thing is, I talked
to his development guy,

223
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:46,778
and they're concerned about the
movie being in black and white.

224
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,580
That's okay, that's okay.
We can, uh...

225
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,118
- Maybe we can talk him into it.
- Right. Okay, guys, look.

226
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,286
If you don't like him,
we're gonna find somebody else.

227
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,155
But Justin can make
your movie happen.

228
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,823
So be open. Okay?

229
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,992
Yeah. We're open.

230
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,928
Here you go.
Thank you so much.

231
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,296
I know you're his brother. Shh.

232
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:08,833
Are you... are you Teddy
Dorsey from<i> mad youth?</i>

233
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,769
I'm just trying to be a normal
human being for one day.

234
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,871
Oh, my god.
I'm a huge fan.

235
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:16,374
Har, can we chat for 30 seconds
about the black-and-white thing?

236
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,843
George, have a little faith, please.
Let me get it off my chest.

237
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,780
Guys, guys. Hey. I wanna make a toast.
Seriously.

238
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,848
To this incredible journey
and to us and...

239
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,383
Hey, how's it going? Hi.
Hi.

240
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:26,651
That was a beautiful toast.

241
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,753
Very moving.
I love la.

242
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,889
Oops. Sorry, sorry.

243
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,090
No problem.

244
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,829
Do you like it?
I love this. Yes.

245
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,731
It is your best
business card yet.

246
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,033
Oh, thanks.
But be honest with me.

247
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,235
Am I one of those women who
thinks every one of their hobbies

248
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,904
is worthy of being a profession?

249
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:48,239
- What? No. -Maybe you're just
good at too many things.

250
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:52,911
I love you, but I was a terrible clothing
designer and even worse photographer.

251
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,146
Come on. That's what you've
always been great at.

252
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,981
No, it's true. I don't
wanna say I told you so,

253
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:59,350
but I have been saying
this for, what, 13 years?

254
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:03,021
Well, we will see. I have a meeting with
my first potential client tomorrow.

255
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,256
- That's amazing. Who?
- Her name is Zoey bell?

256
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,158
- Have you heard of her?
- No.

257
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,160
She's a socialite, I guess.

258
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:12,564
Anyway, that's what I found out from
googling her for eight hours last night.

259
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,032
- That's awesome.
- Yeah, I'm nervous.

260
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,400
- Okay.
- What?

261
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,235
Don't kill me for saying this,

262
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,437
- but there's this sweet guy
in my yoga class. -What?

263
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,906
No. Just hold on.
He's newly divorced.

264
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,708
He told me he wants
to be set up with someone.

265
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,577
I'm not ready.
You are.

266
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,412
I have only been separated
for five months.

267
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,447
My god, some people get
remarried after five months.

268
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,249
Okay, but I have a lot
going on with the move

269
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,686
and Isabel
and the girls in a new school.

270
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:36,221
And I...
Look, I'm starting a business.

271
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,856
Right.
Okay.

272
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:40,558
I need to get settled and...

273
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,896
Girls, it's my birthday.
Let's just have fun.

274
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:47,799
So where on the east coast
are you from?

275
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,467
New York.
No way.

276
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:50,902
- I'm from New York.
- Really?

277
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:53,037
Yeah. Where in New
York are you from? Hi.

278
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,639
The Upper East Side.
How about you?

279
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:57,709
Well, not nearly as cool as Upper
East Side. Hello? Excuse me.

280
00:12:57,711 --> 00:12:59,577
Pardon me.
Can I help you?

281
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,212
Can I have
two glasses of rosי, please?

282
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,981
- Yes.
- Thank you.

283
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,586
Hi. How you doin' tonight?

284
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:11,055
Me?
Uh, yeah.

285
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,957
Oh, um, I'm doing great.

286
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,759
Thank you for asking.
Mm-hmm.

287
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:17,228
I'd like to offer to buy
you drinks... really.

288
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,130
But I think the bartender is

289
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,399
slightly under the impression
that I'm taking her home tonight.

290
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,901
Oh. But you're not.

291
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:25,270
No, I'm not.
And why is that?

292
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,472
Because then I'd have to
stop talking to you.

293
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:32,010
I hate to do this, but the manager
is making me ask for your ID, so...

294
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:34,913
So I'll give it to you then.

295
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:37,615
Okay.

296
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,818
How's that? You should
take it as a compliment.

297
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,319
Mm-hmm.

298
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,954
I'm Harry, by the way.

299
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:44,923
I'm definitely old enough
to drink alcohol. Ooh.

300
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:49,360
I'm Alice. Me too.
Obviously.

301
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,558
Bar's closing. How does
everybody feel about dancing?

302
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,993
- Whoo! Yes!
- For sure!

303
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,694
Yeah, somebody feels great.

304
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,472
Oh.

305
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,441
Sorry. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm fine.

306
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,310
Just alcohol makes me
a little bit nervous.

307
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:47,378
And also kissing
a complete stranger.

308
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,347
Mm-hmm.
But I'm fine, I'm fine.

309
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,222
You okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

310
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,092
Is it super hot in here?

311
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,336
Oh.

312
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:13,404
Sorry. I just need a second.
Yeah, yeah.

313
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,840
Do you want water
or a cold washcloth?

314
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:19,177
Wow. You are so maternal, Alice.
You should be a mom.

315
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,046
All right.
I think I'm gonna...

316
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,983
Uh... yep. Yep. Yep. Oh.

317
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,761
Okay.

318
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,412
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

319
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,114
You're awake.
Yeah.

320
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,415
How are you feeling?

321
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:40,418
Better. Better.
Good, good.

322
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,155
Oh, Alice, I'm so sorry you had
to see me like that. Yeah.

323
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:47,492
Oh. It's not exactly a
stellar first impression.

324
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:49,961
Please. I used to throw up all
the time when I was your age.

325
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,629
Oh.

326
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,565
I mean, not all the time,
but, you know, I get it.

327
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:59,103
Yeah. My embarrassment level
is still a 10.

328
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:01,072
So... oop.

329
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:02,074
Sorry.
Oh, yeah.

330
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,243
I had clothes on
when I got here, right?

331
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:07,678
Yeah, I don't know where...
Yeah, I don't know when they...

332
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,447
Mm-hmm. But here they are.
Thanks.

333
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:12,283
I guess George and Teddy
left me here.

334
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:14,185
They must have thought we, uh...

335
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:17,655
Uh, no, no.
Um, they're in the living room.

336
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,358
I guess they passed out too.
Oh.

337
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,727
I guess we all raged last night.
Yeah.

338
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,764
- Did you wash these?
- I did.

339
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:29,734
But only because I was doing a
load, and I've been up since 5:30.

340
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,037
- Thanks.
- Yeah. No problem.

341
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:37,842
Uh... okay.
I'll get out of your hair then.

342
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,544
Great.
Okay.

343
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:42,847
Not that you... you do not have
to feel bad about any of this.

344
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,349
I never get out, like, ever.

345
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:49,153
So this was actually really good for
me, and I had a really fun time.

346
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,689
And, thanks to you, I didn't do
anything I regret, so...

347
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,824
And I just always act out
on my birthday.

348
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:57,061
It's like my own personal new year's
Eve, so I just go, like, waah!

349
00:19:57,063 --> 00:20:01,299
Then I just reel it back
to normal.

350
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:03,901
Look, hey, I'm happy to let
some steam out of the kettle.

351
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:06,837
I'm, uh, gonna stand up now.

352
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,940
Oh, yeah, exactly.
Yes, okay, of course.

353
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:14,078
Grab it quickly.
Okay, okay.

354
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,347
I can't believe you're making us
late on our first week of school.

355
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,249
I said sorry.

356
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:21,252
Hurry up, you guys.
Rosebud, grab the backpack.

357
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:22,653
Okay, Nanna.

358
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,424
Well, well.

359
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:28,426
Huh.

360
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,995
Okay, you're just gonna
grab the backpack.

361
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:34,265
Hi. What are you guys doing home? I
thought Nanna was taking you to school.

362
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:36,867
What's going on?
You're acting weird.

363
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,870
I'm not acting weird.
Oh, my...

364
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:41,872
- Oh, my god.
- -Alice.

365
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:44,575
What?

366
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:49,113
He was fixing that... you know that thing
that's broken in my room underneath the...

367
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:51,616
Uh, IZ, can you
go fix Rosie a bagel?

368
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:53,184
Sure. Come on.
Thanks.

369
00:20:53,186 --> 00:20:54,785
- Mom.
- Who are those guys?

370
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,521
- I don't know.
- You could've called first.

371
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:00,524
Well, who would've thought you'd
have company at 7:00 in the morning?

372
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:03,060
- So, uh, we're just
gonna slip out.

373
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:06,464
Thank you very much
for everything, Mrs., um...

374
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:09,066
- Oh, my god.
- You look so familiar.

375
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,768
Have we met before?

376
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,737
That's insane.

377
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:15,606
No, I feel like I definitely
know you from somewhere.

378
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,975
She was married to John Kinney.
She was in all of his movies.

379
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,243
Who's this one now?

380
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:21,746
- Oh, my god.
- Wait.

381
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:24,248
You're Lilian Stewart.
That's awesome. Really?

382
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,084
And I'm pretty sure
this is John Kinney's house.

383
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,086
Hold on. How do you
know all of this?

384
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:32,757
I stumbled into that room back there
with all your dad's stuff. I'm sorry.

385
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:36,727
I just got a little lost. I'm a
huge, huge fan of your father's.

386
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:39,163
- You're John Kinney's daughter?
- Yes, she is. And you are?

387
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:41,432
- Am I free to head home now?
'Cause I... -not yet.

388
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:44,068
- Yep. Okay. -As fun as this
has been, believe it or not,

389
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,771
I have a meeting to go to,
so maybe we should wrap it up.

390
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:49,440
We're filmmakers too, you know?
Just like your husband.

391
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:51,642
Everybody is, doll.
We're in la.

392
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:55,413
I can't believe you're here and you're you.
This is surreal.

393
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:58,153
- You're a terrific actress.
-Come on. I mean,

394
00:21:58,178 --> 00:22:00,484
I did a few small
parts here and there.

395
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,254
You were also smokin' hot. Like in
the movie with the yellow bikini.

396
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:06,023
- I was like, "whoa, hello!"
- Come on!

397
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:09,760
Alice, did you hear what he said?
Yes.

398
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:14,365
John sits down at the table next to mine
at ma Maison, and 10 minutes later,

399
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:18,202
he pulls his chair up to mine
and offers me the lead in<i> Lola.</i>

400
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:20,771
Said he liked the way I
ordered my quiche Lorraine.

401
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:23,207
- I know.
- So I have to get going.

402
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:25,710
Does anybody
wanna walk out with me?

403
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:28,179
Actually, I'm gonna stay and
make the boys some breakfast.

404
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:30,648
So can you drive the kids to school?
This is so fun.

405
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,184
Is that cool if we hang with your
mom for a little? Yeah. No, no.

406
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,585
That's fine with me.

407
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,856
Wait, you're saying that was
your first movie ever?

408
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,958
I know, right?

409
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,227
Hey, Alice? Do you have a minute?
Yeah.

410
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:46,297
Sure. Could we just maybe
exchange phone numbers or...

411
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:48,366
I don't know.
Harry, I'm very late.

412
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:52,069
Listen, I think you woke up to a completely
different person than you met last night.

413
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:54,472
And I appreciate the
gesture, I really do,

414
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:56,907
but how old are you, like, 30?

415
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:59,744
Twenty-nine?

416
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:00,911
Twenty-eight?
Something like that.

417
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,413
- Oh, Jesus.
- Bye, Nanna.

418
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:04,482
Okay, girls, come on.
Time to get in the car.

419
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:07,051
Okay, okay.
She's so intense.

420
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,886
No, I'm not.

421
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,489
Good luck with everything.
Maybe I'll see you around.

422
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:13,824
Hope so.
Come on, ladies.

423
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,328
- Did you guys have a sleepover?
- -What?

424
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,897
How did you meet? Yeah, are
you friends with their mom?

425
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,832
Friends with their mom?
How old do I look?

426
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:23,434
I don't know. Mom age.

427
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:28,439
Wow, you have done just a
tremendous amount of work, Alice.

428
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:31,509
Oh, yeah. This is
just a lot of blue.

429
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:33,744
Well, I googled your house...

430
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,347
Yeah. And I thought the
Hamptons thing would be great.

431
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:38,582
Yeah. Why don't you
sit down for a second.

432
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,885
Oh, sure.
Yeah. I-i, um...

433
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:44,422
God, I feel like I might've
misled you in some way.

434
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:49,860
Because the truth is I don't
have this much stuff for you.

435
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:51,962
At least not right now.
Oh, okay.

436
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:55,533
Maybe I misunderstood, because on the phone
you said you were unhappy with things.

437
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:57,601
Yeah, yeah, and I did say that.
I did say that.

438
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,204
You're absolutely right.
I am unhappy with things.

439
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:03,274
But if I'm just being
honest with you,

440
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:05,476
I was working with
this other interior decorator,

441
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:08,479
and we just have creative differences,
or whatever you want to call it.

442
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:12,483
Like I just kind of hated her,
and so I had to let her go.

443
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:17,488
And I'm looking for someone really just
to coordinate deliveries and pickups

444
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,791
and that kind of thing, and
then after we wrap all that,

445
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:25,095
then maybe we can talk about you doing
some of the rooms that she didn't get to.

446
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:26,964
Does that sound okay with you?

447
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:30,301
Oh, yeah. Of course. Absolutely.
I'm up for anything.

448
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:33,070
'Cause there is one room that I
would need you to start right away.

449
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:35,072
That would be amazing.
What room?

450
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:37,641
It's my daughter
Gwyneth's playroom.

451
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:40,978
Okay. Do you want to
show me the room?

452
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,581
I can't do that right now because
I have to take this call.

453
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,349
I'm sorry about that,
and I have a blowout.

454
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:47,985
But why don't you e-mail me, and
then... of course. Well, um...

455
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,921
Okay, so the meeting's over. Then
we'll sort of organize everything.

456
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:56,327
Okay. Should I follow... okay. Marta,
can you please show Alice to G's room?

457
00:24:56,329 --> 00:25:00,164
Marta! By the way, can you just make sure to
take your shoes off when you get into the house.

458
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:03,267
Yeah, of course. We have a strict policy.
Rob, I hear you. Jesus.

459
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:05,736
Uh...
No need to yell.

460
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,509
So she taught you
about the solar system?

461
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:14,111
Mm-hmm.
Oh, can you name any of the planets?

462
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:18,315
I can name Mercury,
Venus, earth,

463
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:21,852
- Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.
- Mm-hmm.

464
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,522
Pluto isn't considered
a proper planet.

465
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:26,724
All right.
Here you go.

466
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:28,392
Oh. Oop, sorry. I forgot you.

467
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,829
What?

468
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:33,297
Just hear me out.

469
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:36,300
They need a place to crash,
you've got a guesthouse.

470
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:38,636
So I thought, you know,
maybe they could stay here.

471
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:41,872
Stay here? I don't even know
two of their names, mom.

472
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:46,176
Oh, come on. Since when is having three
adorable guys hanging around such a bad thing?

473
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:48,379
Maybe they could help you out a little.
Help me out?

474
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:51,482
Help me out with what? Did
they ask you to ask me this?

475
00:25:51,484 --> 00:25:53,317
No. Absolutely not.
Tell the truth.

476
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,185
It was entirely my idea.

477
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,521
I think these boys have
a real shot at making it.

478
00:25:57,523 --> 00:26:00,891
I adored their movie.
It was raw and great.

479
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,227
You saw their movie?
Yeah. Look.

480
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,595
They're dead broke.

481
00:26:04,597 --> 00:26:06,497
If you don't let them stay here,

482
00:26:06,499 --> 00:26:10,367
then they have to move home back
to upstate New York or wherever

483
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:13,604
and blow their chance
at having a career here.

484
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:15,773
They need you, Alice.
How's that?

485
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:17,942
They don't know anyone here.

486
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:21,178
I like them. Your father
would have liked them.

487
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:26,784
Be a patron of the arts, Alice.
It's good for the soul.

488
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:29,353
Why are you suddenly
romanticizing dad?

489
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:32,289
The man impregnated another woman
while he was still married to you.

490
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:33,857
Why do you always obsess
over that?

491
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:35,726
Why don't you obsess over that?

492
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:40,097
Because I'm a big girl,
and he's gone now, so I won.

493
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,467
If they hadn't met me,
was there a plan "b"?

494
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,970
Maybe it was fate
that they met you.

495
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:48,305
Maybe you could be
the person who says,

496
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:52,643
"they were living at my house when
they wrote" whatever it's called.

497
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:54,278
Just for a month or so.

498
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,214
- A month?
- Okay, a week, whatever.

499
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:59,316
If it doesn't work out,
sayonara.

500
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:02,653
But just try looking at this

501
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:04,688
as something that could be
sort of exciting.

502
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,925
What if the kids
don't feel comfortable?

503
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:10,260
You know everything that
Isabel is going through.

504
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:13,998
This could really set her off.

505
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,933
Okay.

506
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:21,972
Yes!

507
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,642
- Whoo!
- There we go, there we go, there we go.

508
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:27,745
We can do better than that.
Okay. All right, we're back.

509
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,985
This is so incredibly cool
of you. Thank you so much.

510
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,788
Seriously, you're a lifesaver.
Can I help you with anything?

511
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,690
Uh, no, I've got it.

512
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:42,660
Uh, okay. The couch
turns into a bed.

513
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:44,962
The hot water over here
takes a minute to turn on,

514
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:47,331
and there's extra towels
in the closet.

515
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,732
- Perfect. Thank you.

516
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:55,873
Uh, I'm just gonna grab that
and flush it down the toilet.

517
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:58,609
Okay, guys, I hope last
night didn't confuse you.

518
00:27:58,611 --> 00:28:00,477
This is definitely not
an after-party

519
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:02,446
and crash-on-the-couch
type of place.

520
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:05,015
This is more of
a market-list-on-the-fridge,

521
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:08,719
Latin-homework-after-school,
dinner-at-six kind of house.

522
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:10,654
I know that's not
the coolest stomping grounds

523
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:12,523
for a bunch of starving
artists like yourselves,

524
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:15,826
but let's just do our best
not to cramp each other's style.

525
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:18,462
- Okay?
- Well said.

526
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:20,731
Can I talk to you
outside for a sec?

527
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:24,501
Alice, I think you and I
should just start over.

528
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:28,038
Yeah, obviously, we... well, we had
no idea we'd be living together.

529
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,175
We're not. I mean that
I'd be staying here.

530
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:37,548
And, well, uh, clearly I did not
rock your world last night.

531
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:43,821
So maybe we should just pretend that whole thing
never happened and start over as friends?

532
00:28:43,823 --> 00:28:46,256
I agree. And I'm actually
glad you brought it up.

533
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:48,692
Good, and I'm only
saying something

534
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:51,729
because we're staying here
and the kids and everything.

535
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:53,363
Harry, we're good.
We're friends.

536
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:56,166
Who are attracted to each other.

537
00:28:56,168 --> 00:29:00,904
On just my end.
Not on yours. My bad.

538
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,340
He's telling her
they should just be friends.

539
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:05,409
How do you know that?
Mm, I speak Harry.

540
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:08,545
Do you think he'll stick to it?
Depends how long we're here.

541
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:11,014
She seems uneasy. You think
she's okay with this?

542
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:14,251
No, I think she's super cool with
it, and this place is gorgeous

543
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:18,956
and, like, weirdly clean, and
600 times nicer than the hotel!

544
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:21,759
Okay, let's just stay a couple days
until the Justin Miller meeting.

545
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:24,328
Oh, my god, I'm not kidding.
You gotta feel these sheets.

546
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:30,834
Oh, wow, these sheets are insane.
What are they made of?

547
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:35,339
Dude!
This is pretty great.

548
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:52,623
You know that was his least
favorite of all his films?

549
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:55,759
- He tried to buy it back from the studio.
- Hi. I'm sorry.

550
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:58,495
I came over here unannounced.
I'm just an early riser.

551
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,898
Then I noticed that the door
was open and... it's okay.

552
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,666
I've been dying
to get back in here.

553
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:04,635
Are you joking about
what you just said?

554
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:07,971
Because this movie is some
of his best work, I think.

555
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,473
Actually, I agree.

556
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,508
Oh, let me show you something
really cool. Sit down.

557
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,577
Okay.
Um...

558
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:15,245
Okay.

559
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:18,949
This is the original script
with his notes.

560
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:20,884
No way.
Yes.

561
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,989
Wow. I just love to
see his handwriting.

562
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,492
I literally have goose bumps.

563
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,460
Why is this all in boxes?

564
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:33,497
Shouldn't this be at the academy of
motion picture arts and sciences?

565
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:37,768
Yeah, I just moved back, and I'm having a
hard time letting go of some of these things.

566
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,937
Why did you move back?

567
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:41,772
If you don't mind me asking.

568
00:30:41,774 --> 00:30:45,309
No, that's
a very normal question,

569
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:48,312
and one I should probably
come up with an answer for.

570
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:51,215
Um... you know, my husband
and I are separated.

571
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:55,018
He's in the music business, and
there's just a lot of partying.

572
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,888
Which was really fun, and
we had a great time. Yeah.

573
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:02,693
And then we got older, and we weren't
kids anymore, and then we had kids.

574
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:06,997
And he was still coming in at 2:00 in
the morning smelling like don Julio.

575
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:09,700
And I tried to hold it together.
I really, really did.

576
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:12,135
So hard. It was...

577
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:14,371
But, you know, god, you make
a decision about your life

578
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:17,374
when you're 25 years old, and then
you fast-forward 15 years later,

579
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,077
and you think, "god, was that
really the life decision

580
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:22,746
that's, like, a good life decision
for the rest of your life?"

581
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:25,148
And then you're just like...
"I don't know!"

582
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,516
Yeah.

583
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:28,752
I don't know. You know?

584
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:31,488
I'm sorry about your marriage,

585
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,690
but you seem to be handling
everything really well.

586
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:42,232
Oh.

587
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,736
Oh, my god. What?

588
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:48,105
My new client wants me to come
over, but I told her I can't come.

589
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:50,274
Isabel has guitar lessons
on Thursdays.

590
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:53,243
And she wants me to pick her up
a pressed juice on the way?

591
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,611
That's weird, right?

592
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:57,247
Yeah, I think that
would be considered weird.

593
00:31:57,249 --> 00:32:02,085
Um... I could take Isabel
to class if you want.

594
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,922
I mean, I don't have a car,
but I'd be happy to help.

595
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:07,624
Really? Thank you.
Yeah.

596
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:11,028
My dad's old car is in the garage. You
know how to drive a stick, right?

597
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,264
Mm-hmm.

598
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,404
So you like your new school?

599
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:21,838
Um, I do not. No.

600
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,742
Oh. Today actually
wasn't so bad.

601
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:28,211
I want to be a writer, and my
homeroom teacher, miss Avery,

602
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:30,213
told me about
this playwriting contest.

603
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:34,151
Teachers pick about five plays to
be performed at the fall show.

604
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:37,454
Miss Avery thinks I should submit
something, but I'm really not sure.

605
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:41,491
That's so cool.
You should definitely do it.

606
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:44,061
Well, truthfully,
I would love to,

607
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:46,797
but we have to perform
our own plays,

608
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,666
and I don't think my body
would physically allow for that.

609
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:52,436
Won't you regret it if you don't do it?
It sounds like a great opportunity.

610
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:57,674
Yeah, but I get sort of anxious, you know?
Just sometimes.

611
00:32:57,676 --> 00:33:00,110
It's on and off,
and the cause is unknown,

612
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:02,679
but it may be related to an
imbalance of natural chemicals

613
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:04,414
between the nerve cells
and the brain.

614
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:06,450
Says WEBmd.

615
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:10,420
Ah. Sorry.
I should take this.

616
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:12,956
We'll get back to that.
Uh, hello?

617
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:15,625
<i>George, Jason green from WCA.
How ya doin'?</i>

618
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:19,296
Hi. I'm great, thanks. Uh, what's up?
<i>I have good news.</i>

619
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:21,365
There's this thriller I think we
told you about in our meeting.

620
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:23,700
They're looking for someone
to do a new pass on the script.

621
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:25,769
I sent over your writing
samples, and they loved them.

622
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:27,537
<i>Loved. Can I set up a meeting?</i>

623
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:29,973
Wow, uh, I'm flattered.

624
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:31,942
That's, uh...
They used the word "loved"?

625
00:33:31,944 --> 00:33:34,111
<i>Really?</i> No, but you
could just tell.

626
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:36,380
Oh. Is that
the other Jason?

627
00:33:36,382 --> 00:33:38,315
<i>Hi. Yes, I just
jumped on.</i>

628
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:39,816
Oh, hi. Uh, yeah.

629
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:42,219
Can I discuss with the guys
and then let you know?

630
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:44,988
It wouldn't be the worst thing for
you to put your name out there,

631
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,823
<i>make some money.</i>

632
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:49,192
<i>We got a job. I'll set it up.
This is good. I promise.</i>

633
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,328
- Will you let me think about it?
- Hello? Jason?

634
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,462
Other Jason?

635
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,333
That sounds pretty cool.

636
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:58,835
Yeah.
Yeah, it does, right?

637
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:01,905
I just don't know if I'm
ready to go out on my own.

638
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:05,976
Won't you regret it if you don't do it?
Sounds like a great opportunity.

639
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,746
- I like what you did there.

640
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:12,149
That was good.
Mm-hmm.

641
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:14,751
Okay, so we're gonna redo
the whole playroom.

642
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,853
You want it a little more
age-appropriate.

643
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:19,222
You want to keep bright colors
but tone down the pink.

644
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:20,824
A teepee would be cool. Hmm.

645
00:34:20,826 --> 00:34:22,259
Maybe some beanbag chairs.

646
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:23,860
Hey, hi, girls.
Sorry to interrupt.

647
00:34:25,264 --> 00:34:26,830
Oh, hey, Dexter.
Hi, honey.

648
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:31,068
Alice, can I borrow you
for a second? Sure.

649
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,670
I was supposed to be at this
event, like, 15 minutes ago,

650
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:36,206
and then my nanny calls me and
tells me she's in brutal traffic.

651
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:38,442
She's not gonna be here
for another hour.

652
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:41,511
I wouldn't normally do this, but could
you please stay until she gets here?

653
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:44,281
Oh, well, I mean, it's
5:15, and I have to...

654
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:47,184
I know. I mean, obviously,
I would pay you for your time.

655
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:48,919
I don't know what else to do.

656
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:50,520
You wouldn't have to pay me.
You're so sweet.

657
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:52,522
Thank you so much. Hey, G!
Well, I...

658
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:55,959
Alice is gonna babysit for you until
Idalia gets here, okay, honey? I love you.

659
00:34:55,961 --> 00:34:58,295
And could you give her a
bath, just a quick one?

660
00:34:58,297 --> 00:35:00,630
And then let Dexter out before
you go, okay? Thank you.

661
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,035
Okay.

662
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:09,973
- Hello?
- <i>When were you gonna tell me</i>

663
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:12,809
<i>that three strangers
were living in your house?</i>

664
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:15,645
I'm sorry. I know.
I should have.

665
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:17,614
I mean, are you
airbnb-ing the house?

666
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:20,383
<i>- What? No, of course not.
- So where did you meet them?</i>

667
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:22,486
I met them at a...
You know what? Look.

668
00:35:22,488 --> 00:35:24,254
It's really not
that big of a deal.

669
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:26,156
They're gonna stay in
the guesthouse for a few days.

670
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:28,258
It was actually
my mother's idea.

671
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,161
<i>Isabel told me that one of them
drove her to her guitar class.</i>

672
00:35:31,163 --> 00:35:32,829
I don't want your houseguests

673
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:34,664
hanging out
with the girls, okay?

674
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,733
I feel weird enough
about not being there.

675
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:38,568
Well, then why don't you
come here?

676
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,337
<i>You don't think
I'm not dying to see them?</i>

677
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:42,806
But I-i just can't right now.

678
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:45,142
There's this new guy
I'm tryin' to sign,

679
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:47,210
and his concert's
this weekend in Miami.

680
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:51,014
He's supposed to be
the next Sam Smith.

681
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:54,151
<i>Really.</i> Yeah. But I'll
come out soon though.

682
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,685
<i>I promise.</i>

683
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:56,786
Don't shake your head.

684
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:57,988
I wasn't.

685
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,689
<i>I gotta go, Austen.</i>

686
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:01,925
<i>You'll get here
when you get here. See you.</i>

687
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,165
- Hey, you're home.
- Hi, mom.

688
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,800
Hey. I'm home
and I'm starving.

689
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:12,936
It smells so good in here.

690
00:36:12,938 --> 00:36:15,605
When you were working, I thought
I'd make dinner, if that's cool.

691
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,541
- Yeah. That's cool.
- Never thought of that.

692
00:36:17,543 --> 00:36:19,209
I think that's
absolutely brilliant.

693
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:20,877
Mm-hmm. <i>Hola.</i> Hey.

694
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:22,512
Isabel, I think someone
needs a Marg.

695
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,381
Uh-oh.

696
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:27,717
Thank you.
Now please unlearn that.

697
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,487
- Hey, guys, dinner's ready.
Let's do this.

698
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:32,689
Shall we take the plates outside?
Mm-hmm? Mm-hmm.

699
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,025
- What's outside?
- You'll see.

700
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:37,661
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

701
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:39,796
I can't tell you.

702
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,820
<i>I feel like I know you
from somewhere.</i>

703
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:06,389
<i>Oh? Well, I just moved here.</i>

704
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:07,791
<i>Where from?</i>

705
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,168
Wow.

706
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,284
Hey.
Hey.

707
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:36,553
Can I help?
Sure.

708
00:37:36,555 --> 00:37:38,388
Thank you for tonight, Harry.

709
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,257
Are you kidding? I
should be thanking you.

710
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:42,525
No, seriously.
I, um...

711
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:45,528
My kids haven't seen that many of my
dad's movies. So it was really special.

712
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:48,031
Well, they are so cool,
by the way.

713
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:50,033
Job well done.
Thanks.

714
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:52,202
Mm-hmm. They're really
taking to you guys.

715
00:37:52,204 --> 00:37:54,738
I think they're happy to have
some male energy around here.

716
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,172
It is very pink in this house.

717
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:00,243
You seem to have aced
the single parent thing though.

718
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:05,582
Really aced it. I mean, yeah. Look, I
assume it's not as easy as it looks.

719
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:08,718
Well, you have an "I've got
this" thing about you,

720
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,320
and it's super impressive.

721
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:12,956
And personally, I th...

722
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,125
Look, I think it's pretty brave

723
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:17,127
what you did, starting over.

724
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:20,330
I don't know your ex, but, uh,

725
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:23,166
he must be some kind of maniac to
have let you slip through his hands.

726
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,370
Where does this go?

727
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:31,541
Uh, it goes over there.

728
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:41,651
You know this cabinet
is broken, right?

729
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,254
Okay.
You gotta stop blushing.

730
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:47,223
Your face is too cute when you blush.
I can't handle it.

731
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:49,392
You got a screwdriver?

732
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,295
Thanks.

733
00:38:52,297 --> 00:38:54,998
That cabinet has been broken
for so long. You have no idea.

734
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,535
Anything else I can do for you?

735
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,772
Got anything from Ikea
I can assemble or...

736
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,452
I thought we agreed not to.

737
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:17,454
I know. I know.

738
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:18,955
But I fixed your cabinet.

739
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,626
Hey, you know I'm 40, right?

740
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:26,663
Uh, yeah, I knew that.
Like ballpark.

741
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:28,698
Okay, good, and, uh,

742
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,380
I didn't know if you'd ever gone out
with somebody my age who has...

743
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:36,239
Two kids.

744
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:39,209
And the girls come in at 6:30
in the morning sometimes,

745
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,144
so you can't be in there then.
That's fine.

746
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:43,146
Then sometimes they come in
in the middle of the night.

747
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:45,715
So you can't be in there then either.
Not a problem.

748
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,452
And also...
Mm-hmm.

749
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,122
Alice?
Yeah?

750
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,058
You're makin' me nervous.

751
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,993
You don't seem nervous.

752
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:58,928
I don't wanna fight with you.

753
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,193
Thank you so much for coming out
on Saturday. I appreciate that.

754
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:32,462
I'm heading to Shanghai tomorrow.
I'm glad we could get this goin'.

755
00:40:32,464 --> 00:40:33,930
Can I get you anything else?

756
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,532
No, thanks, Maya.
This looks fantastic.

757
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:37,066
Okay, great. Enjoy. Thanks.
Thank you.

758
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:39,602
So I'm not gonna pull
any punches here.

759
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,404
I get it.
I'm the horror guy.

760
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:43,406
That's all basically
anybody ever sends me.

761
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:45,608
So when WCA sent me your short

762
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,211
and nobody died in it or turned
into a zombie or something,

763
00:40:48,213 --> 00:40:50,480
I thought, "all right.
This is fantastic."

764
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:52,282
Thank you.
We're glad you liked it.

765
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:54,384
But if I'm gonna go out
of my wheelhouse,

766
00:40:54,386 --> 00:40:56,319
there are basically
three kinds of movies

767
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:58,288
that I'm interested
in producing.

768
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,723
- Female-centric comedies. -George
writes women really well.

769
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:02,926
My love interest is a great part.
Yeah.

770
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:05,261
I wouldn't exactly say it's
a female-centric comedy, but...

771
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:07,263
I totally agree.
Okay, forget women.

772
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:08,932
Here's something else
that might work for you.

773
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:11,401
What about
a found-footage love story?

774
00:41:11,403 --> 00:41:13,236
You know?
No one's ever done that before.

775
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:16,473
You mean, like somebody found footage
of Sam and Jane's love story?

776
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:18,608
I mean,
why would they have been...

777
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,243
Filming themselves.
Filming, exactly.

778
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:22,579
I have no idea.
You know, just a thought.

779
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:24,214
All right,
the last thing I'm into...

780
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,350
- An awards movie. You know?

781
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:30,086
Like a really...
Like a good movie.

782
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:32,422
Like they used to make. We would
love to make a really good movie.

783
00:41:32,424 --> 00:41:33,523
- Yes.
- Yeah?

784
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:35,792
- Yeah.
- Beautiful.

785
00:41:35,794 --> 00:41:38,828
Beautiful. All right, that's what we're
gonna do. We're gonna make a great movie.

786
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,763
So where are we on the script?

787
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:43,500
I'm about halfway through. I think
it's coming along really well.

788
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:45,969
Good, good, okay. I watched
the short again last night.

789
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:47,804
- I made some really great notes.
- Hmm?

790
00:41:48,974 --> 00:41:50,139
Oh. I'm sorry, guys.

791
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:52,008
- I gotta take this. One sec.
- No problem.

792
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,178
- Yeah, go for J. Yes, I saw the e-mail.
- George, what are you doing?

793
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,113
- Shut up, Teddy. I have to.
- Stop it.

794
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:58,948
"Try setting
in the south somewhere.

795
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,617
More<i> American sniper"?</i>

796
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:02,285
It takes place in Brooklyn.

797
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:04,454
- Does it say that?
- It does say that.

798
00:42:04,456 --> 00:42:06,623
- He's gonna walk back.
- "Add dance sequence."

799
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:08,458
"Channing," question mark.
That's what it says.

800
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,526
I gotta go.
George...

801
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:11,494
Do you believe it says that?

802
00:42:11,496 --> 00:42:14,998
I'm so sorry about that, guys.
Just a few quick thoughts here.

803
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,467
- You okay?

804
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:19,502
He had interesting things
to say, George. Like?

805
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:22,305
Like he wants to help us get our movie
made. That was incredibly interesting.

806
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:24,073
He was a parody
of a movie producer.

807
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:26,676
He did say some crazy shit.
What is wrong with you both?

808
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:28,344
He's a big deal,
and he believes in us.

809
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:30,713
That actually makes me
like us less.

810
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,182
Let's just continue the conversation, okay?
It was a first meeting.

811
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:36,653
George? Hey.
Would you look at me? George?

812
00:42:36,655 --> 00:42:38,755
We're on the same team, okay?

813
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:41,724
We can keep talking to him,

814
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,594
but we're not setting it in the south,
where none of us have ever been.

815
00:42:44,596 --> 00:42:46,996
- Fine, I agree. That's not a thing.
- What are you doing?

816
00:42:46,998 --> 00:42:48,598
I've never been in the pacific.

817
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,733
Okay, you're just gonna...

818
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:52,302
I'm goin' in.

819
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:00,243
You know these things
take forever to happen, right?

820
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:03,846
I'm gonna keep writing it the
way we always wanted it to be.

821
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:06,916
Between us, I kinda took another
little job in the meantime.

822
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:10,086
I'm just doing it in my spare time.
Seriously?

823
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:13,022
Yeah. Somethin' came
my way from WCA. Guys!

824
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:15,892
No kidding. What's the job?
Come in!

825
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:18,595
Don't tell Harry. I won't.
What is it?

826
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:20,964
- If he found out, he'd make it about him.
- Just tell me already.

827
00:43:20,966 --> 00:43:22,966
It's a rewrite of a thriller.

828
00:43:22,968 --> 00:43:27,637
Anyway, it pays well, and it's good
to have a backup plan, you know?

829
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:30,273
What if being three boy wonders
doesn't work out?

830
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:33,076
Harry has this vision
of the three of us

831
00:43:33,078 --> 00:43:35,144
lined up in tan suits at Cannes.

832
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:37,547
Meanwhile, for once, I'd like
to be able to make money.

833
00:43:37,549 --> 00:43:40,717
Well, just warn me before you tell
him so I can leave the country.

834
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:43,920
At some point you're gonna need to
learn to be less of a little brother.

835
00:43:43,922 --> 00:43:45,655
I don't have the same shit
with him that you do.

836
00:43:45,657 --> 00:43:47,557
You support him
sleeping with Alice then.

837
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:50,893
Can I not be the odd man out because I
am the only one not pining for Alice?

838
00:43:50,895 --> 00:43:53,329
Okay, come on.
We're not goin' there.

839
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:55,632
All I'm sayin' is
"iceberg ahead."

840
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:57,900
'Cause when he
changes his mind about her,

841
00:43:57,902 --> 00:44:00,603
or she gets tired of his shit...

842
00:44:00,605 --> 00:44:03,640
All I'm sayin' is we need to start
lookin' for another place to live.

843
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:06,342
Which I'll be able to pay
for now because of my job.

844
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:08,478
I don't want to leave Alice's.

845
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,013
I like being with her family.

846
00:44:10,015 --> 00:44:11,914
We're gonna have to leave
eventually.

847
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:14,250
Well, eventually
ain't today, my bro.

848
00:44:14,252 --> 00:44:15,785
Attica!

849
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:17,787
Attica!

850
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:19,656
Attica!

851
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,291
I'm glad you do.

852
00:44:22,293 --> 00:44:24,193
I mean, I just...
I don't know.

853
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:27,764
I think the dialogue needs a bit
of... yeah, well, you wrote it.

854
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:29,432
And exhale. Let it go.
Ooh.

855
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:30,867
Wonderful.

856
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:33,236
Hold on. I don't think
we should interrupt.

857
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:35,471
Yeah.

858
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,274
Okay.

859
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,144
Namaste. I'm Teddy.
Hi.

860
00:44:41,146 --> 00:44:42,245
Hi.

861
00:44:46,151 --> 00:44:47,483
No, I'm just kidding.

862
00:44:47,485 --> 00:44:49,485
No, no, I'm doing it...

863
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:51,521
Tell me about the other guys.
What are they like?

864
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:54,223
Okay. Well, Teddy used to work
at the genius bar,

865
00:44:54,225 --> 00:44:56,659
so he's been helping me with
my website, which is awesome.

866
00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:58,361
He's adorable.

867
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:00,863
And George
has really taken to Isabel.

868
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:03,800
He encouraged her to submit
a play to a school contest,

869
00:45:03,802 --> 00:45:05,535
which has been amazing for her.

870
00:45:05,537 --> 00:45:07,036
Yeah, hold on a minute.

871
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:08,404
I think you're telling me

872
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:10,206
that you have
free live-in childcare,

873
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:13,176
full-time tech support,
and sex?

874
00:45:13,178 --> 00:45:15,044
I can't complain.

875
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:45,908
Yeah, and I don't...

876
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:37,326
I think you should bring Harry
to my dinner party tomorrow.

877
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:38,895
What? No, no.

878
00:46:38,897 --> 00:46:41,230
It'd be good to take him
for a spin in the real world,

879
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:44,467
where the lights aren't so dim
and the sheets aren't so soft.

880
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:47,904
Okay, well, we are not there yet.
That feels like a lot.

881
00:46:47,906 --> 00:46:50,640
Why is it a lot? Seems like the perfect
chance to show off your new boyfriend.

882
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:52,475
He's not my boyfriend.

883
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:53,709
What is he then?

884
00:46:56,313 --> 00:47:00,183
I don't know. He's young, and I
might feel too self-conscious.

885
00:47:00,185 --> 00:47:02,418
All the single guys
we know date women that age.

886
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,320
They're not self-conscious.
That's true.

887
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:05,688
Come on. Bring him.

888
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:07,857
Okay. Maybe.

889
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:09,759
Maybe.

890
00:47:09,761 --> 00:47:11,861
This is
just gonna take a second.

891
00:47:11,863 --> 00:47:13,396
Why are the gates open?

892
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,805
Hmm.

893
00:47:22,807 --> 00:47:24,540
Hey, uh, is Zoey here?

894
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:27,210
Uh, she'll be back soon.
Can I help you?

895
00:47:27,212 --> 00:47:29,212
I just have these pillows
for the playroom.

896
00:47:29,214 --> 00:47:31,380
Oh, okay, I can take it.
Uh, and you're?

897
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:34,817
Oh, uh, I'm sort of
her decorator.

898
00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:35,885
Really?
Yeah.

899
00:47:35,887 --> 00:47:37,587
I'm sort of her decorator.

900
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:41,057
Oh, right.

901
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:44,460
She said there was someone she kind
of had creative differences with.

902
00:47:44,462 --> 00:47:47,196
Yeah. I quit,
if that's what you mean.

903
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:49,498
But she begged me to come back.

904
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,834
I mean, she made me an
offer I couldn't refuse.

905
00:47:51,836 --> 00:47:54,837
Sorry. I didn't know
that she hired someone else.

906
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:56,706
She said she was desperate.

907
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:59,008
"Desperate"? What did she
say when you called her?

908
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:02,511
She was talking a million miles a minute,
like she'd had one too many green juices.

909
00:48:02,513 --> 00:48:04,580
She said, "this other woman
made her feel more comfortable

910
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:06,716
because she'd worked with her
for years."

911
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:09,585
Then she said, "I'll call you back in two
secs," but she<i> never</i> called me back.

912
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:12,388
Basically, I've been doing all
this ridiculous work for nothing.

913
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:15,091
I mean, I organized
this woman's jeans, Teddy.

914
00:48:15,093 --> 00:48:16,826
Whoa.
What are you taking?

915
00:48:16,828 --> 00:48:18,561
It's for anxiety, you know.

916
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:21,397
I just take a half of a half,
and never during the day.

917
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:22,965
That's a large half.

918
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:27,003
I should have quit
before it came to this.

919
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:29,939
- Yeah, that sounds great.

920
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:34,043
Alice, everything you told me about this woman
sounds awful, but you gotta check yourself.

921
00:48:34,045 --> 00:48:36,245
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- Promise?

922
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:39,749
I do. I mean, look at us.
How did we end up here with you?

923
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:42,084
I think things do
actually work out for a reason.

924
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:44,253
And just forget about Zoey.

925
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:47,790
This means it's time to move on, which is
gonna be easy because your website's live...

926
00:48:47,792 --> 00:48:49,358
- What?
- And your pinterest is up,

927
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,227
and it's all linked
to your Facebook and Instagram.

928
00:48:51,229 --> 00:48:53,629
My website is live? Oh, yeah.
Check it out, buddy.

929
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:56,265
Oh, my god.
Teddy, this is amazing!

930
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,367
Ah. Thank you.

931
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,704
That was Justin.
Yeah?

932
00:49:01,706 --> 00:49:03,739
He thinks he might have found
someone to finance our movie.

933
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:05,541
No way! That's amazing! Yeah.

934
00:49:05,543 --> 00:49:08,311
We're gonna get drinks tomorrow
to talk about it. Wow. Oh, wait.

935
00:49:08,313 --> 00:49:10,279
Does that mean
you're busy tomorrow night?

936
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:13,616
Yeah, but just for a little. Did
you have something in mind?

937
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:15,785
I mean, I did, actually.

938
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:17,753
Tracy's having
this little dinner thing,

939
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:21,724
and if you were up for it, I thought
maybe you would come with me?

940
00:49:21,726 --> 00:49:23,626
I'd love to do that.
Really?

941
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:26,062
I've been wanting to do something
with you outside the house.

942
00:49:26,064 --> 00:49:27,997
I mean, I love what we've
been doing inside the house,

943
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:30,433
but, yes, let's be on a date.

944
00:49:30,435 --> 00:49:32,301
Okay.
Okay.

945
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:34,236
I'll have to meet you
after the drinks.

946
00:49:34,238 --> 00:49:36,906
Sure. No problem.
What should I wear?

947
00:49:36,908 --> 00:49:39,442
It's not, like, dressy, is it?

948
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,660
No.
He'll have one more.

949
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:09,772
I knew that
she was taking my magazines.

950
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:39,568
We're gettin' along really well.

951
00:51:02,427 --> 00:51:04,527
You doing okay?

952
00:51:04,529 --> 00:51:05,728
Yeah, yeah.

953
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,678
What are you guys talking about?

954
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:56,979
Can I come in?

955
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:03,319
Alice, I am so sorry
about last night.

956
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:06,155
The drinks, they went late. And
Justin, he invited all these people.

957
00:52:06,157 --> 00:52:08,724
And the guy wouldn't shut up.

958
00:52:08,726 --> 00:52:12,795
And I'm pretty sure he's getting us
the money, so I couldn't ditch him.

959
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:16,465
I think that's...
I think that is straight.

960
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:19,502
Oh, you couldn't ditch him,
but you could ditch me.

961
00:52:19,504 --> 00:52:22,638
No, I... I... didn't know what else to do.
I got caught up and...

962
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,974
You know what the truth is?
I don't care what happened.

963
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:27,910
I know how it made me feel, and
I don't wanna feel like that.

964
00:52:27,912 --> 00:52:32,148
Okay, well, please don't let one stupid night
get in the way of what's happening here.

965
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:34,450
What is happening here?

966
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:37,419
I don't think either of us
know the answer to that.

967
00:52:37,421 --> 00:52:40,623
Okay, 'cause you came to me and you
said we shouldn't get involved.

968
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:43,993
And then you showed up
and you fixed my cabinet door,

969
00:52:43,995 --> 00:52:45,661
and-and-and then you
kiss me.

970
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:47,363
And...

971
00:52:47,365 --> 00:52:49,498
Whatever.
I allowed that to happen.

972
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,701
But at some point I have
to start knowing better.

973
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:54,703
And that point is now.

974
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:57,840
You're
a 27-year-old kid, Harry.

975
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:00,609
And it's exciting,
and you're fantastic,

976
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:03,612
and you're on the cusp
of being a really great guy.

977
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:06,448
But 27-year-olds
just screw up.

978
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:08,617
They just do.

979
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:10,619
I know 'cause I used to be one.

980
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,789
But the last thing
that I need right now

981
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:16,725
is to be sitting
at some party in a dress

982
00:53:16,727 --> 00:53:20,029
waiting for someone or something
that isn't gonna show up for me.

983
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:22,831
So whatever this is or was,

984
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:24,733
it's just gotta end.

985
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:26,468
Okay?

986
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:28,637
I know this because...

987
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,075
Because I know this.

988
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:37,379
Harry, you said you
were gonna play with us.

989
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:40,015
Yeah, okay. One second, champ.
One second.

990
00:53:40,017 --> 00:53:41,217
Okay.

991
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,522
Okay. Okay. Okay, okay.

992
00:53:46,524 --> 00:53:49,858
I screwed up. I was wrong.
I wasn't thinking.

993
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,261
Can I make it up
to you tonight, please?

994
00:53:52,263 --> 00:53:53,896
Uh, no. Actually,
I'm going out tonight.

995
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:55,831
You... where?

996
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:57,032
I have a date.

997
00:53:57,034 --> 00:53:58,234
You have...

998
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:01,136
Why wouldn't I?

999
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:08,010
Miss Avery e-mailed me.
They picked my play!

1000
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:09,712
I knew it.
I didn't.

1001
00:54:09,714 --> 00:54:12,514
This is major. Congrats.

1002
00:54:12,516 --> 00:54:14,717
Can I ask you a beyond
huge enormous favor?

1003
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:16,418
Oh, and you can say no.

1004
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,221
Oh, sorry. Am I
interrupting you working?

1005
00:54:19,223 --> 00:54:20,923
Oh, is it that other job?

1006
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:23,225
Yeah, but who cares? What's up?
You can ask me anything.

1007
00:54:23,227 --> 00:54:26,528
Will you go up onstage
with me, at the play?

1008
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:27,696
Onstage?

1009
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:30,466
No, not like
in the play or anything.

1010
00:54:30,468 --> 00:54:33,435
Just off to the side. You can
see the whole thing from there.

1011
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:35,704
I asked miss Avery,
and she said it was fine.

1012
00:54:35,706 --> 00:54:38,941
I told her it's like having an
emotional support dog, only human.

1013
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:40,943
Anyways,

1014
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:43,979
just in case I feel nervous or like
I'm gonna pass out or anything.

1015
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:45,914
Just seeing you there
would make... hey, IZ.

1016
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:48,684
It would be a great honor.
I'll be there.

1017
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,989
Yeah, so they
never found my brother.

1018
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:55,324
So naturally, I don't do boats.

1019
00:54:55,326 --> 00:54:59,061
But I gotta let that go.

1020
00:54:59,063 --> 00:55:02,965
What do you do? Because
Kori wasn't exactly sure.

1021
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,967
I used to work for a developer.

1022
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:07,970
Basically, we would just
tear down things you love

1023
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:09,571
and put up things you hate.

1024
00:55:09,573 --> 00:55:12,041
Are you gonna drink that?
No. You can have it.

1025
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:14,610
Yeah, so... oh, Alice.

1026
00:55:14,612 --> 00:55:17,146
Have you seen
that Ted talk by any chance

1027
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:18,814
on the science of happiness?
Mm-mmm.

1028
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:21,083
I think you'd really like it.
Is it that obvious?

1029
00:55:21,085 --> 00:55:23,185
No, that's not what I'm saying.

1030
00:55:23,187 --> 00:55:25,020
It's just...
It just really touched me.

1031
00:55:25,022 --> 00:55:27,189
And about eight months ago,
I quit my job.

1032
00:55:27,191 --> 00:55:28,857
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. Just like that.

1033
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:30,592
I had a Jerry Maguire moment.

1034
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:32,528
Oh, my god,
I love<i> Jerry Maguire.</i>

1035
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,963
Yeah, I moved to Bali and
lived there for a few months

1036
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:37,299
until I came down with malaria
and had to come back here.

1037
00:55:37,301 --> 00:55:39,435
And I'm trying to get
my old job back.

1038
00:55:39,437 --> 00:55:43,706
I think it was Thomas
browne... sir Thomas browne...

1039
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:47,042
Who said, "I am
the richest man alive.

1040
00:55:47,044 --> 00:55:48,677
I have that in me
which"... oh, my god.

1041
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,045
I'm okay.

1042
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:51,547
My arch Nemesis is here.

1043
00:55:51,549 --> 00:55:53,315
Why do you have an arch Nemesis?

1044
00:55:53,317 --> 00:55:55,551
She's standing next to
the<i> Sarah, plain and tall</i> girl.

1045
00:55:55,553 --> 00:55:58,120
She looks
all rich and depressed.

1046
00:55:58,122 --> 00:56:00,823
I'm gonna go talk to her, Nate. Oh,
Alice, I don't think you should.

1047
00:56:00,825 --> 00:56:03,292
I'm gonna do it.
Alice, don't do that.

1048
00:56:03,294 --> 00:56:04,693
Here I go.
Alice.

1049
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:05,761
They... okay.

1050
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:15,337
- Hi, Alice. My gosh.
- Zoey, hi.

1051
00:56:15,339 --> 00:56:18,240
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I'm on a date.

1052
00:56:18,242 --> 00:56:20,042
With a man.

1053
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,411
Great.

1054
00:56:22,413 --> 00:56:25,314
Um, I don't think you've
met my husband, rob.

1055
00:56:25,316 --> 00:56:26,682
This is Alice.
Okay.

1056
00:56:26,684 --> 00:56:28,817
She's been sort of helping
out around the house.

1057
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:31,987
Nice to meet you, rob.
I'm your wife's bitch.

1058
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:34,256
I don't know
if I would call it that.

1059
00:56:34,258 --> 00:56:37,192
Really? Would you say
you're a nice person to me,

1060
00:56:37,194 --> 00:56:39,228
or would you say you're nicer
to maybe the labrapoodle?

1061
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:40,496
It's a labradoodle.

1062
00:56:40,498 --> 00:56:41,563
Whatever.

1063
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:44,032
Okay.

1064
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:46,402
What are you doing with your face?
Are you unwell?

1065
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:48,837
- I think it's Dexter.
- Okay, that is not nice, Alice.

1066
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:51,440
He's a rescue, and I find
that really offensive.

1067
00:56:51,442 --> 00:56:54,042
You've had a little bit
too much to drink

1068
00:56:54,044 --> 00:56:56,078
and you're sort of
embarrassing yourself.

1069
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,746
I'm embarrassing myself?
Yes.

1070
00:56:57,748 --> 00:57:00,382
Well, that's refreshing. Because
normally that's your department.

1071
00:57:00,384 --> 00:57:03,352
- Am I right, Bob? -Alice,
let's just call this quits,

1072
00:57:03,354 --> 00:57:05,387
and I will call you
in the morning.

1073
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:09,925
Hey, babe, I quits, okay? Because you
cheated on me with the fancy stylish woman.

1074
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:12,127
And on top of that,
you're a deeply dark individual.

1075
00:57:12,129 --> 00:57:14,296
So... we done.

1076
00:57:14,298 --> 00:57:15,564
Great.

1077
00:57:15,566 --> 00:57:16,665
We... done.

1078
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,841
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

1079
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:30,846
Brutal.

1080
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:47,162
Ah, boy.

1081
00:57:47,164 --> 00:57:50,365
So, wanna tell me what happened?

1082
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:56,171
Well, I drank my date
under the table.

1083
00:57:56,173 --> 00:57:57,973
And I was so rude.

1084
00:57:57,975 --> 00:58:02,511
And then I saw Zoey bell in her
kimono and her cute husband,

1085
00:58:02,513 --> 00:58:04,413
and I went temporarily insane.

1086
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:07,282
Jesus.

1087
00:58:07,284 --> 00:58:10,018
I hope you quit at least.
Oh, yes.

1088
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,354
That I made very clear.

1089
00:58:12,356 --> 00:58:16,725
Well, dare I ask why you're feeling
so pugnacious this evening?

1090
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:21,330
All signs point
to the lead singer of your band.

1091
00:58:21,332 --> 00:58:24,433
Ah. I was afraid
of that.

1092
00:58:24,435 --> 00:58:27,836
You know, he tends to have
this effect on people.

1093
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:32,140
Thing you gotta realize about
Harry, and I say this out of love,

1094
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:36,178
is he doesn't do
the right thing enough.

1095
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,913
Doesn't know how.

1096
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:40,449
Trust me.

1097
00:58:40,451 --> 00:58:43,285
Do you know what the difference
is between men and women?

1098
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:48,490
Men just...
They can just do things.

1099
00:58:48,492 --> 00:58:51,059
And women have to think
about the consequences

1100
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:53,328
and the feelings
and the pros and cons.

1101
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,497
And we make lists.

1102
00:58:55,499 --> 00:58:57,499
And men just act.

1103
00:58:57,501 --> 00:58:59,401
They just do.

1104
00:58:59,403 --> 00:59:01,436
Not you though, George.

1105
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,306
You're one of the good ones.

1106
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:11,747
Thank you, Alice.

1107
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,117
You're like a woman.

1108
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:32,734
Oh, my god.
Tell me you see him too.

1109
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:35,871
Austen, what are you doing here?

1110
00:59:35,873 --> 00:59:38,941
Well, I've been
calling you for hours.

1111
00:59:38,943 --> 00:59:40,943
Where have you been?
Where are the kids?

1112
00:59:40,945 --> 00:59:43,345
They're at my mom's.
But wait.

1113
00:59:43,347 --> 00:59:45,347
I was just...

1114
00:59:45,349 --> 00:59:47,849
I know I just
asked you this, but...

1115
00:59:47,851 --> 00:59:50,519
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, god, Alice.

1116
00:59:50,521 --> 00:59:53,922
Oh. I don't know. I don't know.
I've been going out of my head.

1117
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:56,925
I just can't think straight.
Is that one of them?

1118
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,894
Hello.

1119
00:59:58,896 --> 01:00:00,662
Hi. Okay.

1120
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:03,332
Hey there.

1121
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:07,636
George Appleton.
Hi.

1122
01:00:07,638 --> 01:00:09,671
Big fan of your family, yeah.

1123
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:13,408
- Mm-hmm. -Okay, I'm
gonna let you two, uh...

1124
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:15,944
'cause I gotta... I'm
just gonna... yeah, okay.

1125
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:19,281
Oh, it feels so good to be here.

1126
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:21,516
Oh, god.

1127
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:25,420
You did such an incredible
job with the house.

1128
01:00:25,422 --> 01:00:27,322
It totally feels like you now.
Thanks.

1129
01:00:27,324 --> 01:00:29,224
I'm really impressed.

1130
01:00:29,226 --> 01:00:32,761
God, you remember us sittin' in here
when you brought me to meet your dad?

1131
01:00:32,763 --> 01:00:35,063
Yeah, a million years ago.

1132
01:00:35,065 --> 01:00:37,065
And you look different too.

1133
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:38,767
I do? Yeah. Relaxed
or something.

1134
01:00:38,769 --> 01:00:41,136
You look fantastic, Al.

1135
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,939
Well, you're catching me on a
really stellar roll tonight.

1136
01:00:43,941 --> 01:00:46,808
I've had quite a... you know
I had to come here, right?

1137
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:51,780
You get that. I mean, there are three
strange guys living with my family.

1138
01:00:51,782 --> 01:00:55,250
And you stopped calling me back
all of a sudden, you know?

1139
01:00:55,252 --> 01:00:57,419
Girls are not
facetiming me anymore.

1140
01:00:57,421 --> 01:00:59,421
- Where do you keep your forks?
- In the drawer.

1141
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:02,357
So you just
showed up unannounced?

1142
01:01:02,359 --> 01:01:03,925
Don't you think you
should have called first

1143
01:01:03,927 --> 01:01:05,661
and then told me
that you were coming

1144
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:07,829
so I could have at least
prepared, told the girls?

1145
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:10,532
I would have called. Or is this
just what worked for you, Austen?

1146
01:01:10,534 --> 01:01:13,774
I would have called, but I was afraid you
were gonna tell me that I couldn't come.

1147
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,304
I always tell you to come.

1148
01:01:16,306 --> 01:01:18,340
You know, when you left...

1149
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:22,577
I finally felt like I wasn't
lettin' anyone down anymore.

1150
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:26,481
And that was good, for a minute.

1151
01:01:26,483 --> 01:01:28,984
But then I realized

1152
01:01:28,986 --> 01:01:30,719
that the best part of my life

1153
01:01:30,721 --> 01:01:33,188
had just moved away
across the country.

1154
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:36,858
And there I was,
alone in our old place.

1155
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,927
There was no more laughter.

1156
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:41,697
No meals together.

1157
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:45,100
No more monkeys
jumping on the bed.

1158
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:49,004
And I miss our family.

1159
01:01:49,006 --> 01:01:51,073
So I bought a ticket to la,

1160
01:01:51,075 --> 01:01:52,641
and I left within the hour

1161
01:01:52,643 --> 01:01:55,110
because I wanted
to say this to your face.

1162
01:01:57,246 --> 01:01:59,281
To your beautiful face.

1163
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:01,950
Let's fix this.

1164
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:05,120
Let's not give up.

1165
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:08,824
What's he doing just
showing up out of nowhere?

1166
01:02:08,826 --> 01:02:10,759
We should go in there.
She needs us.

1167
01:02:10,761 --> 01:02:12,694
Oh, really? You're
gonna go in there.

1168
01:02:12,696 --> 01:02:14,563
You're gonna say, "I'm
the captain now," huh?

1169
01:02:14,565 --> 01:02:16,565
Look. They're sitting
so close together.

1170
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:18,533
Guys, enough, okay? He's the
father of her children.

1171
01:02:18,535 --> 01:02:20,235
She's moved on. She
doesn't need him anymore.

1172
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:22,170
George, is he good-looking?
I can't tell from here.

1173
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:24,339
What's his vibe?
Is it loser-y?

1174
01:02:24,341 --> 01:02:27,342
I don't know. He's got like a
classic Clark gable thing.

1175
01:02:27,344 --> 01:02:29,411
There's like a little bit
of Sean Penn in there.

1176
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:32,047
Like he could jump ya at any moment.
You know what I mean?

1177
01:02:32,049 --> 01:02:34,616
Clark gable meets Sean Penn?
I'm going inside.

1178
01:02:34,618 --> 01:02:37,953
Harry, come on, man. The last thing she
needs. How do you know what she needs?

1179
01:02:37,955 --> 01:02:40,155
Oh, my god.
She's taking him to the guest room.

1180
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:43,091
He's staying.

1181
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:45,193
Well, thank you
for putting me up.

1182
01:02:45,195 --> 01:02:47,996
I'm a little bit drunk. I'll
probably regret it in the morning.

1183
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:52,100
I'm not that drunk.

1184
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:54,536
Good night, Austen.

1185
01:02:54,538 --> 01:02:56,972
Well, I meant what I said, Al.

1186
01:02:56,974 --> 01:02:58,874
Will you just think about it?

1187
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:22,130
Mmm.

1188
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:30,739
Good morning.

1189
01:03:30,741 --> 01:03:32,874
Oh, hi.

1190
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:36,878
Please, take a seat.

1191
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:48,390
Harry.

1192
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:51,326
Austen.

1193
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:52,861
Why is he staying with us?

1194
01:03:52,863 --> 01:03:56,164
What am I supposed to do,
ask him to stay in a hotel?

1195
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:59,701
Why is this guy in la? I can think
of three really good reasons.

1196
01:03:59,703 --> 01:04:02,604
- Seems pretty selfish to just show up like this.
- Well, meet Austen.

1197
01:04:02,606 --> 01:04:04,206
Alice, please stop avoiding me.

1198
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:06,808
Can we just...
I don't know... talk?

1199
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:09,678
- Whoa.
- Girls. Girls.

1200
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,146
- Guess what.
- What?

1201
01:04:11,148 --> 01:04:12,180
Daddy!

1202
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:13,348
Good morning!

1203
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,217
Daddy!
Oh!

1204
01:04:15,219 --> 01:04:18,353
- I'm so happy to see you guys.
- -I can't believe you're here!

1205
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:20,856
Rosie, you're so tall.

1206
01:04:20,858 --> 01:04:23,058
Look at you.
You're like a supermodel.

1207
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:25,393
IZ, look at... oh, my goodness.
Loving those sneakers.

1208
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:27,028
When did you get here?

1209
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:29,731
Late last night. We thought
we'd surprise you this morning.

1210
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:31,499
- Come on.
- Good to see you, Lil.

1211
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:33,635
Yeah. Hi.
Mwah. Mwah.

1212
01:04:33,637 --> 01:04:36,805
Looking fetching as usual.
Me? You are nuts.

1213
01:04:36,807 --> 01:04:40,242
Look, I have to change for my spinning
class, so I'm going to get going.

1214
01:04:40,244 --> 01:04:42,611
- Ally, I'll talk to you later, okay?
- Yep.

1215
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:45,313
Still cute.

1216
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:49,017
Hmm.

1217
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:51,152
Okay, let's eat.

1218
01:04:51,154 --> 01:04:53,989
Okay, okay, but then we were
walking back from dinner

1219
01:04:53,991 --> 01:04:56,324
on this beautiful moonlit night

1220
01:04:56,326 --> 01:04:57,993
through this tiny little village

1221
01:04:57,995 --> 01:05:00,428
just outside
Saint-rיmy-de-provence.

1222
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:03,565
- And we took one wrong turn.
- Oh.

1223
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:06,101
- And suddenly out of nowhere...
- oh, my god, I forgot about this.

1224
01:05:06,103 --> 01:05:08,436
This strange
little woman appeared.

1225
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:10,105
Yes.

1226
01:05:10,107 --> 01:05:12,908
She pushes me in the chest.
She grabbed your mother's bag.

1227
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:16,544
And your mother just immediately,
without a second thought,

1228
01:05:16,546 --> 01:05:17,879
sprints after her,

1229
01:05:17,881 --> 01:05:21,616
leaps into the air
and tackles her to the ground.

1230
01:05:21,618 --> 01:05:24,052
- Oh, my god.
- That's funny, mommy.

1231
01:05:24,054 --> 01:05:26,688
I'm pretty sure there was no
leaping, and I didn't tackle her.

1232
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:28,456
So you weren't
both on the ground?

1233
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:30,458
Yes, but... your mother was incredible.
You should have seen her.

1234
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,594
She was just... just beyond.

1235
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:34,462
She was wildly impressive.

1236
01:05:34,464 --> 01:05:36,564
I don't know about that, but...

1237
01:05:36,566 --> 01:05:39,034
So, IZ, did you tell your
daddy about your play?

1238
01:05:39,036 --> 01:05:40,235
She did.

1239
01:05:40,237 --> 01:05:41,903
She did.
It's very exciting.

1240
01:05:41,905 --> 01:05:43,772
I'm not surprised, because she's
always been a great writer.

1241
01:05:43,774 --> 01:05:45,140
Will you stay for it, daddy?

1242
01:05:45,142 --> 01:05:47,909
- When is it again?
- Next Friday.

1243
01:05:47,911 --> 01:05:49,144
- Yeah.
- Ah.

1244
01:05:49,146 --> 01:05:51,913
Well, I'm not sure
if I can stay that long.

1245
01:05:51,915 --> 01:05:55,817
But if I can, I will.
I'm desperate to be there.

1246
01:05:55,819 --> 01:05:58,720
You know, George has been really
very helpful with the play.

1247
01:05:58,722 --> 01:06:00,622
Did I tell you
the guys are filmmakers?

1248
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:02,557
Yeah, yeah. Heard that.

1249
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:04,592
God, I have no idea
how you guys do it.

1250
01:06:04,594 --> 01:06:06,995
It takes such discipline.

1251
01:06:06,997 --> 01:06:09,164
And I guess
at the end of the day,

1252
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:10,832
it's totally down
to luck, isn't it?

1253
01:06:10,834 --> 01:06:12,133
If it turns
into anything, right?

1254
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:13,635
Yeah. Luck and talent.

1255
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:15,203
Copy that.

1256
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:17,672
Lot of luck.

1257
01:06:17,674 --> 01:06:19,841
Hey, I had an idea. Why don't
we go for dinner tonight?

1258
01:06:19,843 --> 01:06:21,476
- Oh yeah!
- Yeah!

1259
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,845
Sunday night dinner like we used to.
That would be fun, right?

1260
01:06:23,847 --> 01:06:26,448
- You could show me your new favorite place.
- Yeah, can we, mommy? Please.

1261
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:28,516
Yeah, we could go early,
be back by 8:00.

1262
01:06:28,518 --> 01:06:30,485
Please.
Okay, sure.

1263
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:32,020
Yay!

1264
01:06:32,022 --> 01:06:33,989
Just a sec!

1265
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:36,691
Hi.
Hey.

1266
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:39,127
I thought I'd check in. I know
it's none of my business.

1267
01:06:39,129 --> 01:06:41,963
I just wanted to make sure that
you're okay. Yeah. Come in.

1268
01:06:41,965 --> 01:06:44,165
No, I'm completely fine.

1269
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:46,935
I mean, on the one hand,
Austen is saying things to me

1270
01:06:46,937 --> 01:06:49,170
that I've wanted to hear
for god knows how long.

1271
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:51,606
And on the other hand, he's the
actual king of manipulation.

1272
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:59,214
Hey, can I come in for a second?
Yeah.

1273
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:01,449
Hey.

1274
01:07:01,451 --> 01:07:02,884
Did not know you were in here.

1275
01:07:02,886 --> 01:07:04,986
I hope this
isn't out of line, but...

1276
01:07:04,988 --> 01:07:06,955
- you look really nice, by the way.
- You do.

1277
01:07:06,957 --> 01:07:09,124
- Thanks.
- Just really worried about the girls, you know?

1278
01:07:09,126 --> 01:07:11,493
I have experience
with guys like this,

1279
01:07:11,495 --> 01:07:13,395
and their dad
shows up out of nowhere,

1280
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:16,164
and he's acting like he's father
of the year when we know he isn't.

1281
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:18,366
He's gonna move back to New York.
What happens to iz...

1282
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:20,535
Alice, I've gotta talk to you.

1283
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:22,237
Oh, my god.

1284
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,872
Can it wait?
I'm a little bit busy.

1285
01:07:23,874 --> 01:07:26,141
Uh, no, it can't.

1286
01:07:26,143 --> 01:07:29,544
I feel like everything is out of sorts
between us. Wow. You look great.

1287
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:31,379
And smell great.
Can I come in?

1288
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:33,448
Do you have
an Advil? I...

1289
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:35,884
Didn't realize
I had an audience.

1290
01:07:35,886 --> 01:07:38,453
We're just gonna have
to talk about this later...

1291
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:43,224
What, I didn't make the cut
for the pre-party?

1292
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:45,160
No, there is nothing going on.

1293
01:07:45,162 --> 01:07:46,995
There's never been
so many people in this room.

1294
01:07:46,997 --> 01:07:49,397
We're gonna be late.

1295
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:52,067
You guys,
I will talk to you later.

1296
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:53,735
It's gonna be good.

1297
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:56,638
Bye.

1298
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,473
Good night.

1299
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:01,943
Okay.

1300
01:08:01,945 --> 01:08:03,812
Night, kids.

1301
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:08,316
I don't like him.
Mm-mmm.

1302
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,420
It's way past Rosie's bedtime.

1303
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:14,122
Should we call and make sure
that everything's okay?

1304
01:08:14,124 --> 01:08:15,623
I'm shocked
she married that guy.

1305
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:18,093
- She knows his bracelets are a problem.
- I don't know.

1306
01:08:18,095 --> 01:08:20,261
I could see him having a certain
appeal when they were younger.

1307
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:21,830
The accent's cool.

1308
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:24,132
Hey, we were just starting to...

1309
01:08:24,134 --> 01:08:27,202
- Shh.
- Oh. Sorry.

1310
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:29,871
Did you guys have a good night?

1311
01:08:29,873 --> 01:08:32,440
Yeah. Nothin' special.
Just ate some lasagna.

1312
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:34,375
What was left of it.

1313
01:08:34,377 --> 01:08:36,744
- How was your dinner?
- The girls had a great time.

1314
01:08:36,746 --> 01:08:37,879
And you?

1315
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:40,515
I actually had fun too.

1316
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:45,153
Um, well, we were gonna
have a nightcap.

1317
01:08:45,155 --> 01:08:48,223
You wanna come over
to our place?

1318
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:52,660
I'm exhausted.
I'm gonna hit the hay.

1319
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:54,696
Night, guys.

1320
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:58,333
- Yeah, good night.
- Night.

1321
01:08:58,335 --> 01:09:00,735
It's not true. She never falls
asleep before midnight.

1322
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:02,570
Okay, thank you.

1323
01:09:02,572 --> 01:09:04,239
We did not need to know that.

1324
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:09,777
Night-night.
I'll see you in the morning.

1325
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:12,013
I love you, daddy.

1326
01:09:12,015 --> 01:09:15,083
Oh, I love you too,
my beautiful girl.

1327
01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:20,421
Sleep well.

1328
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:28,263
"He reaches for the painting.

1329
01:09:28,265 --> 01:09:33,801
Floats in slow motion
through the air."

1330
01:09:33,803 --> 01:09:34,969
Georgie.
Hey.

1331
01:09:34,971 --> 01:09:36,471
Great news.

1332
01:09:36,473 --> 01:09:39,374
The finance guy is flying in
to meet with us next Friday.

1333
01:09:39,376 --> 01:09:40,708
We're meeting him
at sunset tower,

1334
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:42,710
and then we'll go from there
to see Isabel's show.

1335
01:09:42,712 --> 01:09:44,312
Perfect. Hey, actually,
hold on a sec.

1336
01:09:44,314 --> 01:09:47,482
Relax. I just wanna show you an
article I read about this guy.

1337
01:09:47,484 --> 01:09:49,117
"The painting floats
in slow motion."

1338
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:51,452
What is this? What are you working on?
Okay, actually, I was...

1339
01:09:51,454 --> 01:09:53,188
You're writing something else?

1340
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:56,291
Let me explain.
Uh, yes.

1341
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:01,296
How could you do that?

1342
01:10:01,298 --> 01:10:03,498
How could you do it? We're
almost done with our script.

1343
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,366
You're working on something
else at the same time?

1344
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:08,069
Okay, yes, but look,
you've decided, right,

1345
01:10:08,071 --> 01:10:09,971
that we're
two halves of this whole,

1346
01:10:09,973 --> 01:10:13,308
and I've been thinking that maybe I could
be a whole on my own at some point.

1347
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:16,211
And our agents agree. Oh, okay.
Right. Right. Okay.

1348
01:10:16,213 --> 01:10:18,012
So you're the talent.

1349
01:10:18,014 --> 01:10:20,848
I'm just the one who got us our
financing, who directed our movie,

1350
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:23,418
who submitted us to the
festival, who got us to la.

1351
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:25,653
You know that's not what I'm saying.
And then you go rogue

1352
01:10:25,655 --> 01:10:28,856
and you get another job
without telling me.

1353
01:10:28,858 --> 01:10:30,892
Shit, George.
You know...

1354
01:10:30,894 --> 01:10:34,195
This has not stopped me from working
on our movie, not even one bit.

1355
01:10:34,197 --> 01:10:36,431
And excuse me if I wanna
make some goddamn money

1356
01:10:36,433 --> 01:10:39,400
and get the hell out of the mess that
you've created in this house, by the way.

1357
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:41,402
Did you not even realize?
You don't even know?

1358
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:43,838
Did you think you could just have
sex with her and play with her kids

1359
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,340
and everything would turn out fine?
Don't.

1360
01:10:45,342 --> 01:10:47,442
You know what? Leave your
brain to science, Harry,

1361
01:10:47,444 --> 01:10:49,677
'cause it's truly one in a mil.
You know what? No.

1362
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,412
I'm not letting you do this.

1363
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:53,348
I'm not, man.

1364
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:55,250
You're a little
in love with Alice,

1365
01:10:55,252 --> 01:10:57,218
and you're mad at me
because of it.

1366
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:58,453
Wow.

1367
01:10:58,455 --> 01:11:00,455
You and I have been
down this road before.

1368
01:11:00,457 --> 01:11:03,124
Okay, I am not in love
with her, okay?

1369
01:11:03,126 --> 01:11:06,527
I just love a lot of things about her,
like her face and her personality.

1370
01:11:06,529 --> 01:11:07,862
Hey.

1371
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:12,600
What up, guys?

1372
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:15,036
What is that? What is that?
What are you holding?

1373
01:11:15,038 --> 01:11:17,138
What? Oh, these.
They're audition pages.

1374
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:18,706
I'm actually
testing for a pilot,

1375
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:20,541
which I think is a good thing.

1376
01:11:20,543 --> 01:11:22,110
That's terrific, Teddy.

1377
01:11:22,112 --> 01:11:25,046
You're both taking other jobs?
Well, George already took his.

1378
01:11:25,048 --> 01:11:27,848
Why can't you be happy for him? Don't
turn this around on me and Teddy.

1379
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:30,218
Why didn't you tell me?

1380
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:32,754
I haven't gotten it yet, and we
don't have a finished script.

1381
01:11:32,756 --> 01:11:34,555
So why can't I go on auditions?

1382
01:11:34,557 --> 01:11:38,192
You know what? Good luck
to the both of you.

1383
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:46,067
Yeah, okay, well, just call
me after the show, all right?

1384
01:11:46,069 --> 01:11:48,770
Yeah, I'll still be up. Okay.

1385
01:11:48,772 --> 01:11:50,305
Okay, bye.

1386
01:11:58,914 --> 01:12:00,648
Hey, man.

1387
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,383
Can I join you?

1388
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:06,754
Everything cool, brother?

1389
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,692
I saw Harry take off.

1390
01:12:10,694 --> 01:12:12,794
Seemed pretty heated.

1391
01:12:12,796 --> 01:12:14,662
I'm sorry, but I don't
wanna get into it.

1392
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:16,698
It's all good. You don't
have to worry about it.

1393
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:19,701
Well, I wouldn't say that.
This is my house.

1394
01:12:19,703 --> 01:12:21,669
With my kids, my wife.

1395
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:24,205
If there's a problem, I have
a right to know about it.

1396
01:12:24,207 --> 01:12:27,775
With all due respect, Austen, I don't
know if Alice would call this your house,

1397
01:12:27,777 --> 01:12:30,445
and she definitely wouldn't
call herself your wife.

1398
01:12:30,447 --> 01:12:32,547
They are my kids though, right?
Hmm.

1399
01:12:32,549 --> 01:12:34,649
Is that one okay with you?

1400
01:12:34,651 --> 01:12:37,051
What exactly is it
that you're doing here?

1401
01:12:37,053 --> 01:12:39,053
Yeah, it's
a complicated situation.

1402
01:12:39,055 --> 01:12:41,789
At your age, I couldn't
have understood it either.

1403
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:43,925
Try me.

1404
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,962
Well, sometimes...

1405
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:51,999
You need a bit of space
from the things you love

1406
01:12:52,001 --> 01:12:54,168
in order for you to realize

1407
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:56,070
just how much
you really need them.

1408
01:12:56,072 --> 01:12:59,707
Seriously? That sort of thing just
does not apply to your wife and kids.

1409
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:01,509
What do you want from me, man?

1410
01:13:01,511 --> 01:13:03,978
I mean, you're gonna hate me
regardless of what I say.

1411
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:06,581
But if Alice and I are gonna try
and work through our problems,

1412
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:09,050
which I think it's
pretty clear we are,

1413
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:13,087
then this game of house you're all
playing is gonna have to end.

1414
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:14,756
And you think
that's what Alice wants?

1415
01:13:14,758 --> 01:13:16,958
Alice doesn't know
what she wants.

1416
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:21,362
Ow!

1417
01:13:21,364 --> 01:13:23,531
What the hell was that for?

1418
01:13:23,533 --> 01:13:25,867
It was for Alice!

1419
01:13:25,869 --> 01:13:28,669
You do not wanna do this. I am
a trained athlete. I can box.

1420
01:13:28,671 --> 01:13:30,605
Okay, all right,
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1421
01:13:30,607 --> 01:13:32,940
You wanna go for it, pal?
You wanna go?

1422
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:35,376
Come on. Let's go. Let's go!
Hey. Hey.

1423
01:13:35,378 --> 01:13:39,547
Did your stupid hipster brother
sleep with my wife, huh?

1424
01:13:39,549 --> 01:13:41,416
Come on. Man up
and tell me. Tell me!

1425
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:42,750
We're better off without you.

1426
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:44,285
We?
Yeah.

1427
01:13:44,287 --> 01:13:46,487
What are you even saying?

1428
01:14:04,107 --> 01:14:05,673
- Oh, my god.
- Aah!

1429
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:10,778
What is going on?

1430
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:14,415
He-he started it.

1431
01:14:14,417 --> 01:14:16,150
Teddy, what the hell?

1432
01:14:16,152 --> 01:14:19,086
- Okay, hold on. -Okay, let's all
just chill out for a second.

1433
01:14:19,088 --> 01:14:21,889
He's a liability, okay?
There are kids in this house.

1434
01:14:21,891 --> 01:14:24,492
Come on, Alice.
This is insane.

1435
01:14:24,494 --> 01:14:27,995
This is too much for me. I didn't
sign up for this, all of this.

1436
01:14:27,997 --> 01:14:29,664
I agree.
I think he needs to leave.

1437
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,735
I think you guys need to
find somewhere else to stay

1438
01:14:34,737 --> 01:14:36,704
while we get our lives
back on track.

1439
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:40,374
Wait.

1440
01:14:41,276 --> 01:14:42,443
Alice.

1441
01:14:42,445 --> 01:14:44,145
I'm sorry, guys.

1442
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:15,443
You did the right thing, Al.

1443
01:15:15,445 --> 01:15:17,945
He did quite a number on you.

1444
01:15:21,283 --> 01:15:22,917
Ta-da.

1445
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:30,725
Alice, look at me for a second.

1446
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:45,406
Oh, god,
I've missed you so much.

1447
01:15:46,408 --> 01:15:48,075
I had no idea how to be alone.

1448
01:15:48,077 --> 01:15:52,079
Austen, what are we doing?

1449
01:15:52,081 --> 01:15:55,182
Well, our relationship is totally blurry.
You know that.

1450
01:15:55,184 --> 01:15:56,717
I know it is.

1451
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:59,353
And once and for all, I think
we need to clear it up.

1452
01:15:59,355 --> 01:16:01,756
I think we should get back
to... I want a divorce.

1453
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,826
I'm-I'm not following.

1454
01:16:05,828 --> 01:16:08,362
I want a divorce.

1455
01:16:08,364 --> 01:16:10,197
Like I legally don't
wanna be married anymore.

1456
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:11,999
No, I know what divorce means.

1457
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:16,470
I thought we weren't ready
to make such a...

1458
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,911
You're ready.
I am.

1459
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:26,781
I really am.

1460
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:28,783
Right.

1461
01:16:30,786 --> 01:16:31,919
Right.

1462
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:42,630
Oh, god. So I'm the idiot
who's dealt a winning hand

1463
01:16:42,632 --> 01:16:44,665
and still managed to lose.

1464
01:16:46,068 --> 01:16:48,135
I think maybe this
all worked out

1465
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:50,204
the way it was supposed to.

1466
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:03,751
And I guess we both know that
if I'd seen a sliver of hope,

1467
01:17:03,753 --> 01:17:06,721
I would have tried
to weasel my way back in.

1468
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:26,907
Ooh, I really hope he's here.
He has to be.

1469
01:17:26,909 --> 01:17:30,144
Justin is the only
other person he knows in la.

1470
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:32,880
Oh, my hand's killing me.

1471
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,018
Can we come in?
We wanna talk.

1472
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:39,320
Are you gonna be mean?
I'm not in the mood.

1473
01:17:39,322 --> 01:17:41,656
What happened to your face? I
beat the crap out of Austen.

1474
01:17:41,658 --> 01:17:44,058
Bullshit artist.
Come in.

1475
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:47,328
Did Alice see you do it?

1476
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:48,763
Yep.

1477
01:17:48,765 --> 01:17:52,299
And she kinda kicked us out.

1478
01:17:52,301 --> 01:17:54,168
Seriously?
Yeah.

1479
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,570
And what about Austen?
He stayed? Yeah.

1480
01:17:58,273 --> 01:17:59,273
Oh.

1481
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:05,446
You guys hungry?
There's some leftover Nobu.

1482
01:18:05,448 --> 01:18:07,615
Harry, we came
here to apologize.

1483
01:18:07,617 --> 01:18:10,017
Neither of us should have
hidden anything from you.

1484
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:11,952
Is that a no to the Nobu?

1485
01:18:11,954 --> 01:18:14,321
I'll have some. What's Nobu?
It's just Sushi.

1486
01:18:14,323 --> 01:18:17,858
Okay, we were just afraid
that you were gonna think

1487
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:20,528
that we were doubting you
or losing faith in the movie.

1488
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:23,197
That's exactly what I think.
We're not bailing, man.

1489
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,166
My other job is basically done.

1490
01:18:25,168 --> 01:18:27,968
And if Teddy lands another part,
then we will work around it.

1491
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:31,105
He's right. We're doing this, all right?
We're making this happen.

1492
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:41,916
Oh. The Nobu.

1493
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,153
Here you are.

1494
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:48,989
Is dad okay?

1495
01:18:48,991 --> 01:18:51,158
Yeah. Daddy is fine.

1496
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,893
He just has a little bruise.

1497
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:54,895
And he's asleep now,
so he's gonna be okay.

1498
01:18:54,897 --> 01:18:57,598
I'm really sorry that you
guys had to see that.

1499
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,867
Is he moving in with us?

1500
01:18:59,869 --> 01:19:03,337
Well, he's gonna live in la,
which is great,

1501
01:19:03,339 --> 01:19:05,406
but he's not gonna live with us.

1502
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:09,610
What about the guys?

1503
01:19:09,612 --> 01:19:11,746
Did they leave?
Mm-hmm.

1504
01:19:11,748 --> 01:19:13,714
For good?

1505
01:19:13,716 --> 01:19:15,683
I think so.

1506
01:19:15,685 --> 01:19:19,220
Does that mean we won't
ever see them again?

1507
01:19:19,222 --> 01:19:22,189
I mean, George was
gonna come to my play.

1508
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:23,891
Yeah, yeah,
I know George, honey.

1509
01:19:23,893 --> 01:19:26,260
And trust me, he will be there.

1510
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:28,062
And I don't know about you guys,

1511
01:19:28,064 --> 01:19:31,699
but I'm kinda looking forward to it
just being the three of us again.

1512
01:19:31,701 --> 01:19:35,102
Actually, I think
that sounds good.

1513
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:36,670
I could use
some peace and quiet.

1514
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:40,674
Okay.

1515
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:43,644
I love you.

1516
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:22,750
Thank you.

1517
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:29,356
"So what began as a day
like any other

1518
01:20:29,358 --> 01:20:31,826
ended as anything but.

1519
01:20:31,828 --> 01:20:33,294
The end."

1520
01:20:33,296 --> 01:20:34,862
Wonderful.

1521
01:20:34,864 --> 01:20:37,598
I love this part.
Yeah, so did I.

1522
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:16,136
Hi.

1523
01:21:16,138 --> 01:21:17,638
Hi.

1524
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:20,174
Um, come in.

1525
01:21:20,176 --> 01:21:22,009
Is it okay? Yeah. Are you kidding me?
Come on.

1526
01:21:22,011 --> 01:21:24,144
I didn't call, but...
No, it's good.

1527
01:21:24,146 --> 01:21:26,213
We're still
in the moving-in phase, but...

1528
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:28,482
Oh, yeah. Wow.
Yeah.

1529
01:21:28,484 --> 01:21:31,018
This place is great.
Uh-huh.

1530
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:32,052
Oh, man.

1531
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:33,854
Are the guys here?

1532
01:21:33,856 --> 01:21:37,191
Oh, no. They just went out for a bit.
They'll be back any minute.

1533
01:21:37,193 --> 01:21:39,393
Look, this should be me
showing up at your door.

1534
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:43,430
But, uh, I don't know. With
Austen there, I... I just...

1535
01:21:43,432 --> 01:21:45,132
Oh, he's... he's gone.

1536
01:21:46,001 --> 01:21:47,701
He went back to New York?

1537
01:21:47,703 --> 01:21:52,006
No, he's here in la,
just not with me.

1538
01:21:52,008 --> 01:21:55,509
We are officially done, so...

1539
01:21:55,511 --> 01:21:56,944
Wow. Wow.

1540
01:21:56,946 --> 01:21:59,780
Well, a-plus decision.

1541
01:21:59,782 --> 01:22:01,682
Yeah.

1542
01:22:01,684 --> 01:22:02,783
Yeah.

1543
01:22:03,618 --> 01:22:05,152
Um...

1544
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:08,956
Okay.

1545
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:11,592
Alice, like, I should've...

1546
01:22:11,594 --> 01:22:14,261
I should've said this before
in a realer way at least.

1547
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:17,131
But I... I'm-I'm sorry.

1548
01:22:17,133 --> 01:22:19,300
I'm sorry.

1549
01:22:19,302 --> 01:22:22,803
I'm sorry for standing you up
that night.

1550
01:22:22,805 --> 01:22:27,274
And I think... like, I've relived it,
like, a thousand times in my head.

1551
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:30,878
And I just... I can't...
I can't wrap my mind around...

1552
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:33,280
What kind of a person
would do that to you?

1553
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:35,549
Let alone it was me.

1554
01:22:35,551 --> 01:22:39,219
It was one of the top-five worst
decisions I have ever made.

1555
01:22:39,221 --> 01:22:43,557
And I have made some... some pretty
questionable decisions in my time.

1556
01:22:43,559 --> 01:22:47,094
Look, bottom line, you deserve
much, much better than me.

1557
01:22:47,096 --> 01:22:49,396
And I don't mean that
like... like most guys mean it,

1558
01:22:49,398 --> 01:22:51,165
which is that they
don't mean it at all.

1559
01:22:51,167 --> 01:22:54,468
I actually do.
I... I really do.

1560
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:57,404
You know, before I met you,

1561
01:22:57,406 --> 01:23:01,175
I was probably
more alone and terrified

1562
01:23:01,177 --> 01:23:03,844
than I'd ever been
in my entire life.

1563
01:23:03,846 --> 01:23:07,648
And through that
crazy turn of events...

1564
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:10,584
You made that fade away.

1565
01:23:10,586 --> 01:23:13,420
And I'll always
be grateful for that.

1566
01:23:13,422 --> 01:23:14,989
And since you guys
have been gone,

1567
01:23:14,991 --> 01:23:18,492
I've been really trying
to get my life in order.

1568
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:20,961
But it's made me
realize I just...

1569
01:23:20,963 --> 01:23:22,763
I really miss you guys.

1570
01:23:22,765 --> 01:23:25,332
Oh, my god, we miss you so much.
Really?

1571
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:28,435
We talk about it all the time. I'm
so glad to hear you say that.

1572
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,441
Surprise!

1573
01:23:34,443 --> 01:23:35,676
Hey!

1574
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:37,544
Hi!
Oh, my god! Alice!

1575
01:23:37,546 --> 01:23:38,645
Hey!
Hey!

1576
01:23:38,647 --> 01:23:40,180
Hi, Alice.

1577
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:41,882
Oh, you got flowers?

1578
01:23:41,884 --> 01:23:43,484
They always looked
so good at your house,

1579
01:23:43,486 --> 01:23:45,285
I thought we'd get
some for ours.

1580
01:23:45,287 --> 01:23:47,654
Let me help you.
Yeah, thank you.

1581
01:23:47,656 --> 01:23:49,390
Okay, where's the kitchen?

1582
01:23:49,392 --> 01:23:52,059
It's over here.
How's IZ?

1583
01:23:52,061 --> 01:23:54,061
We've been texting a bit. Yeah.

1584
01:23:54,063 --> 01:23:55,229
Yeah, yeah.
She told me.

1585
01:23:55,231 --> 01:23:56,730
She's so hyped up for tomorrow.

1586
01:23:56,732 --> 01:23:58,565
Did she tell you
she started meditating?

1587
01:23:58,567 --> 01:24:01,135
No. But I love that.
Yeah.

1588
01:24:01,137 --> 01:24:03,137
Oh, let me put those
in a vase for you.

1589
01:24:03,139 --> 01:24:05,005
Uh, do you have a vase?

1590
01:24:05,007 --> 01:24:07,641
Uh...
Uh...

1591
01:24:07,643 --> 01:24:08,876
We do not.
Okay.

1592
01:24:08,878 --> 01:24:10,511
We do not have a vase.

1593
01:24:10,513 --> 01:24:12,579
Something to buy you
as a housewarming gift.

1594
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:29,563
All right, my guys.
My guys.

1595
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:30,931
Justin.
Hey, buddy.

1596
01:24:30,933 --> 01:24:33,100
Listen, before we go in
there, whatever happens,

1597
01:24:33,102 --> 01:24:34,868
we're still gonna make
a great movie together.

1598
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:36,703
Okay? Not something you
watch on your smartphone

1599
01:24:36,705 --> 01:24:38,572
and forget about
before it's even over.

1600
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:42,076
Because we got the brains, we got
the heart, we got the nerve.

1601
01:24:42,078 --> 01:24:43,444
Yeah?
Yeah.

1602
01:24:43,446 --> 01:24:45,245
Yeah. All right, come on.
It's gonna be good.

1603
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:47,181
It's gonna be good.

1604
01:24:47,183 --> 01:24:48,715
Yeah, I knew you'd
come around on me.

1605
01:24:50,019 --> 01:24:51,518
Hey.

1606
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,587
Yeah, yeah, we're here.

1607
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:55,989
Sure. Yeah, no problem.
He's running a bit late.

1608
01:25:06,902 --> 01:25:09,303
All right, showtime.

1609
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:17,878
Hey, mom.
Hi.

1610
01:25:20,748 --> 01:25:22,950
- Hey.
- Hey.

1611
01:25:22,952 --> 01:25:24,885
Hi, baby. How was your
sleepover at daddy's?

1612
01:25:24,887 --> 01:25:27,521
It was so fun.
We had pancakes for dinner.

1613
01:25:32,727 --> 01:25:34,228
They'll be here.

1614
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:51,044
Okay, fellas, here's the thing.

1615
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:54,848
I love your script.

1616
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:57,985
I totally get
what you're going for.

1617
01:25:57,987 --> 01:26:03,490
But maybe we could
make it even... bigger.

1618
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:05,359
Okay, sure. How so?

1619
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:07,127
Maybe... I don't know...
It could be sexier.

1620
01:26:07,129 --> 01:26:09,163
You know, add some
more excitement, more action.

1621
01:26:09,165 --> 01:26:12,599
Maybe the Sam character
has to assemble a group of guys

1622
01:26:12,601 --> 01:26:14,535
from various locations,

1623
01:26:14,537 --> 01:26:17,371
and then they have
to pull off a big heist.

1624
01:26:17,373 --> 01:26:19,006
So basically<i> ocean's eleven.</i>

1625
01:26:19,008 --> 01:26:21,675
Yes, love it. Great.

1626
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:24,111
<i>Young ocean's.</i> Exactly.

1627
01:26:24,113 --> 01:26:25,646
Sam isn't really
big-time like that.

1628
01:26:25,648 --> 01:26:28,382
He's just doing it
to get by, you know.

1629
01:26:28,384 --> 01:26:30,784
- Right. Right. -I know. That's
why we could dial that up.

1630
01:26:30,786 --> 01:26:32,853
And then we get somebody
really great to play Sam,

1631
01:26:32,855 --> 01:26:34,655
like that kid from<i> hunger games?</i>

1632
01:26:34,657 --> 01:26:37,057
Well, actually,
we got Teddy attached.

1633
01:26:37,059 --> 01:26:38,659
Remember? I told you about that.
Oh.

1634
01:26:38,661 --> 01:26:40,527
- He's fantastic.
- Right, yeah, yeah.

1635
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:42,696
- You're Teddy.
- Yeah.

1636
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:44,731
Yeah, we'd definitely find
something for you to play.

1637
01:26:44,733 --> 01:26:47,034
Look, Justin, I trust you.
You know that.

1638
01:26:47,036 --> 01:26:50,204
- Yeah.
- And I think that you guys are super talented.

1639
01:26:50,206 --> 01:26:52,239
My only concern
is that it's too small.

1640
01:26:52,241 --> 01:26:54,522
- Or... I don't know... cute.
Is that the right word? -No.

1641
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:58,178
- We gotta run.
- Hey, wait, guys.

1642
01:26:58,180 --> 01:27:00,547
We appreciate you taking the time.
We really, really do.

1643
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:03,717
But truthfully, we have
an 11-year-old's play to attend.

1644
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:07,888
So if your answer is "no,"
which it seems to be,

1645
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:10,557
since you've missed pretty much
every lovely detail in the script,

1646
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:12,659
well, this isn't really gonna
make much of a difference.

1647
01:27:12,661 --> 01:27:16,530
But I'm gonna say it anyway.
I think you're making a mistake.

1648
01:27:16,532 --> 01:27:20,100
Teddy is one of the most talented
actors of our generation.

1649
01:27:20,102 --> 01:27:23,904
And George,
he understands people,

1650
01:27:23,906 --> 01:27:28,442
the way we think and why we do
the unexplainable things we do.

1651
01:27:28,444 --> 01:27:30,677
Film is the great love
of our lives,

1652
01:27:30,679 --> 01:27:32,446
and if you take a chance on us,

1653
01:27:32,448 --> 01:27:34,848
there is like an 80% chance
that we will not let you down.

1654
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:38,785
Now, Warren, quick question.

1655
01:27:38,787 --> 01:27:40,307
Do you happen to have
a car downstairs?

1656
01:27:41,389 --> 01:27:43,590
You were amazing. Amazing!

1657
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:45,692
Har. You sure
you're okay with this?

1658
01:27:45,694 --> 01:27:48,795
Yes. There will be another guy.
Do I look worried?

1659
01:28:01,442 --> 01:28:04,911
Just breathe. Just breathe. You
can do this. You can do this.

1660
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:09,349
Let's go.

1661
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:14,554
- Sorry. The doors are closed.
- What are you... what?

1662
01:28:14,556 --> 01:28:17,457
Once the show begins, no one is admitted.
Those are the rules.

1663
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:19,593
You're joking, right? It's a
fifth-grade play, not<i> Hamilton.</i>

1664
01:28:19,595 --> 01:28:21,928
I am under strict orders
to close the doors at 6:00,

1665
01:28:21,930 --> 01:28:24,631
and it is now 6:15, so...

1666
01:28:24,633 --> 01:28:26,300
I actually need
to get backstage.

1667
01:28:26,302 --> 01:28:28,602
There's a very, very special kid
who will be totally devastated...

1668
01:28:28,604 --> 01:28:30,470
You know what? This is
not my problem. Whoa!

1669
01:28:30,472 --> 01:28:32,205
- Sorry, bud!
- Oh!

1670
01:28:34,008 --> 01:28:37,244
Maybe he should be
an action star.

1671
01:28:37,246 --> 01:28:38,378
Go.

1672
01:28:42,417 --> 01:28:44,685
Okay, you're gonna be great.

1673
01:28:44,687 --> 01:28:48,355
<i>And now,</i> three plus three,
<i>by Isabel Blume.</i>

1674
01:28:56,964 --> 01:28:58,598
Teddy, Teddy.

1675
01:28:58,600 --> 01:28:59,600
There she is.

1676
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:03,570
Shoot! Come on.

1677
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:11,111
- Hey.
- Hi.

1678
01:30:03,164 --> 01:30:05,065
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Gotta get through.

1679
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:11,738
What began...

1680
01:30:12,607 --> 01:30:13,807
Sorry.

1681
01:30:16,911 --> 01:30:18,812
Come on, come on.

1682
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:20,547
Are you George?
Yes.

1683
01:30:20,549 --> 01:30:21,782
Thank god.

1684
01:30:21,784 --> 01:30:23,383
Wait. Who are you?
I'm miss Avery.

1685
01:30:23,385 --> 01:30:24,851
You're miss Avery?
Yeah.

1686
01:30:24,853 --> 01:30:26,953
And you're George?
Yeah.

1687
01:30:26,955 --> 01:30:28,522
Come on.

1688
01:30:28,524 --> 01:30:30,323
She can see you from here.

1689
01:30:31,392 --> 01:30:33,360
What began...

1690
01:30:35,029 --> 01:30:36,296
Isabel.

1691
01:30:37,765 --> 01:30:38,999
Isabel.
Isabel.

1692
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:45,639
You got this.

1693
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:57,818
What began as a day like any
other ended as anything but.

1694
01:30:57,820 --> 01:31:01,755
There must have been something pretty
extraordinary in the air that day,

1695
01:31:01,757 --> 01:31:04,057
even though, as always,

1696
01:31:04,059 --> 01:31:07,894
it was 72 degrees and sunny
in my new hometown,

1697
01:31:07,896 --> 01:31:11,298
the weirdly, wonderful city
of Los Angeles,

1698
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:14,134
which, as it turns out,
isn't much of a city at all.

1699
01:31:20,675 --> 01:31:22,476
Okay, but, you guys, admit it.

1700
01:31:22,478 --> 01:31:25,445
It was a hit, right? I mean, can
you call a school play a hit?

1701
01:31:25,447 --> 01:31:26,813
Because it definitely was.

1702
01:31:26,815 --> 01:31:29,349
- Definitely.
- It was a smash.

1703
01:31:29,351 --> 01:31:31,251
You got a standing "o."

1704
01:31:31,253 --> 01:31:33,353
There were moms in the
audience who were crying.

1705
01:31:33,355 --> 01:31:35,889
- They were crying. -Moms were crying?
I was sobbing.

1706
01:31:37,425 --> 01:31:39,759
And that line about being a kid

1707
01:31:39,761 --> 01:31:42,329
and growing up in New York...
I mean, come on.

1708
01:31:42,331 --> 01:31:45,665
Oh. "Her bedtime was 8:30
in the city that never sleeps."

1709
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:48,001
- That's the one.
- Great.

1710
01:31:48,003 --> 01:31:49,503
I liked the kid who played dad.

1711
01:31:51,606 --> 01:31:53,106
What?

1712
01:31:53,108 --> 01:31:54,508
Was it not about us?

1713
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:57,244
It was about us, right?

1714
01:31:58,305 --> 01:32:58,904

00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,635
Oh, all right,
Mrs. Milldoon,

335
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,907
I'll watch it.

336
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:03,408
From now on,

337
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:06,478
I'll sleep with band-aids
over my mouth.

338
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,749
Band-aids...
On my mouth.

339
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:13,347
Successful artist.

340
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:14,686
Hmm.

341
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,757
Maybe if she saw some
of Rick's paintings...

342
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:51,786
[Knock on door]

343
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:56,661
There's someone
at the door, Abby.

344
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:57,729
Huh?

345
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,860
There's someone at the door.

346
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,265
What goes on at this place?

347
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:02,397
First the banshee downstairs,

348
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:03,672
and now something else.

349
00:20:03,673 --> 00:20:06,200
How'd you talk me
into moving here?

350
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:09,266
Because it's Greenwich
village, and it's romantic.

351
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,535
Besides, my horoscope said

352
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,683
this is where I'd
meet my true love.

353
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:14,679
Hold it.
Finish this pose.

354
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,551
Grrr!

355
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,277
What'll I say now?

356
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,286
Uh, good evening.

357
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,288
My name is Eugene Fullstack,

358
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,690
and I hear you're a
very successful artist.

359
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:29,431
I thought you could meet
my friend Rick Todd,

360
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:31,299
who I believe is one
of the better painters,

361
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,557
and if you would talk to him,

362
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,266
you might cheer him up.

363
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:37,298
He's getting very discouraged
just hanging around.

364
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:38,703
So am I.

365
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:40,705
Good evening. My name
is Eugene Fullstack,

366
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:42,307
and I thought...
whoa! Whoa!

367
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,738
Rick! Rick!

368
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,713
Whoa!

369
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,858
Rick! Rick! Rick!

370
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,259
Rick, I just saw
the bat lady upstairs!

371
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,662
Honest, I saw her
on the fourth floor.

372
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:06,664
Rick, I'm trying
to tell you something.

373
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,666
Aah!

374
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:08,667
Help! Help!

375
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:10,268
No, lady, don't yell.

376
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,536
It's a mistake.

377
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:12,537
Don't yell.

378
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:13,938
No, lady, please.

379
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,407
No yelling, lady.

380
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:16,668
I'm sorry, lady.

381
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:17,806
Help! Oh!

382
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,680
Help, police!

383
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,752
The bat lady...
the fat lady!

384
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:27,385
Rick! Rick!

385
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:29,287
Rick! Rick!

386
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,689
Rick, I saw
the bat lady upstairs.

387
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:32,691
What?

388
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:34,292
I saw the bat lady.

389
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,694
Sure. She made a three-point
landing on the roof.

390
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:38,696
Really, she's upstairs
on the fourth floor.

391
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:40,698
Will you go back to sleep?

392
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,300
The bat lady scared me,

393
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:43,702
and I ran into the fat lady.

394
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:45,703
Bat lady... fat lady...
are you crazy?

395
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:47,305
No. This
really happened.

396
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,307
Upstairs is the bat lady.

397
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,439
She scared me,

398
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:52,713
so I ran downstairs
to the fat lady.

399
00:21:52,714 --> 00:21:54,312
She scared me worse.

400
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,314
Eugie.

401
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,315
The bat lady scared me.

402
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,717
The fat lady was downstairs.

403
00:21:58,718 --> 00:22:00,718
I ran downstairs to tell
you about the bat lady.

404
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,090
You're having one
of your bad dreams.

405
00:22:03,091 --> 00:22:04,819
She's got things
sticking out of her head.

406
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,694
She's a crazy-looking
person.

407
00:22:06,695 --> 00:22:08,693
You got things
sticking <i>in</i> your head.

408
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:09,755
Come on.

409
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,562
No, no!
They're out there!

410
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:14,099
There's someone out there.

411
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,769
Open the door. There's
no one out there.

412
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:18,870
I'm scared, Ricky.

413
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:20,341
I thought you loved
the bat lady.

414
00:22:20,342 --> 00:22:22,470
But I'm scared of the fat lady.

415
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:23,865
There's no fat lady or bat lady.

416
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,106
Open the door
so we can go to bed.

417
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:29,377
Oh! I told you
she was out there.

418
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:30,382
The bat lady?

419
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:31,783
No, the fat lady.

420
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,924
There's no one out there.

421
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,387
[Splat]

422
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:43,394
She's out there.

423
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:44,396
The bat lady?

424
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:45,927
The fat lady.

425
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,148
Abby. Abby, look.

426
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:07,751
According to my chart,
it's happened.

427
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:10,761
Tonight my moon is full
and square to Jupiter,

428
00:23:10,762 --> 00:23:12,617
Uranus is square to Sagittarius,

429
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,155
Mars is square to Venus...

430
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,760
I saw him for
the first time tonight.

431
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:19,763
He's the one, my true love.

432
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:21,766
Oh, Bessie, no!

433
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:24,168
That square's your true love?

434
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,170
You tear up that horoscope.

435
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:29,441
The stars don't lie.

436
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:31,982
But isn't it awful
about our children?

437
00:23:31,983 --> 00:23:33,178
Your children?

438
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:36,179
Shouldn't you be
introduced first?

439
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:38,182
Well, suppose
they look like him?

440
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:40,524
Rent them out for Halloween.

441
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:50,525
He's not very handsome.

442
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,666
But he is kind of cute.

443
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,067
You know, the safe kind.

444
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:59,068
The safe kind? What's
safe in pants?

445
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:02,140
The not-so-handsome kind
make the best husbands.

446
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:04,209
Other women don't want them.

447
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,740
The man another
woman doesn't want

448
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:07,876
doesn't exist.

449
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,548
Now, lights out, girl.

450
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:12,149
I've got an early appointment
with my publisher

451
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:13,751
in the morning.

452
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:15,153
Suffering catfish!

453
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:19,157
You're supposed to be
an artist and a writer

454
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:20,758
of children's stories.

455
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,760
Well, you're not an artist,

456
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:24,162
and you're not a writer,

457
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:25,763
not by my wife's standards.

458
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:28,165
I knew I'd make the grade.

459
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:31,867
62 pages of drawings
and no blood?

460
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:34,571
Not even an itsy-bitsy
nosebleed?

461
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:37,174
What, suffering catfish,
do you call this,

462
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:39,006
a murdock book for kiddies

463
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:40,611
with no stranglings,

464
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:42,180
with no decapitations?

465
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:43,981
Where are they?

466
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,717
I must have lost my head

467
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,788
because this is where I get off.

468
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:49,647
Wait, Abigail, please sit down.

469
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,855
Let me explain something to you.

470
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:54,188
I'm a little bit
on the edgy-wedgy.

471
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:56,793
My wife's been
giving me the knife.

472
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:58,196
If sales don't pick up,

473
00:24:58,197 --> 00:24:59,827
she'll give me the ax.

474
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:03,768
You wouldn't want old
murdie boy out of a job,

475
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,169
would you? Hmm?

476
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:07,171
I'm not cupid,
Mr. murdock.

477
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:09,773
If you can't wear the
pants in your family...

478
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:10,765
the pants?

479
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:12,536
Eeee!

480
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:13,775
The pants!

481
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,779
Since Edith and I are separated,

482
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:18,281
it's a wonder I've got
my striped shorts.

483
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:19,654
Look at the competition

484
00:25:19,655 --> 00:25:21,786
we're getting in television.

485
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:23,187
Abigail, night before last,

486
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:26,519
I counted 13 murders,
4 stabbings,

487
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:28,786
9 suffocations, and 6 poisonings

488
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:31,596
on two channels in one hour!

489
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:33,697
And another thing...

490
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,529
just you think of this, girl.

491
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:38,535
When they're able
to show that red blood

492
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:40,538
gushing out of open wounds

493
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,807
in spectacular color...

494
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:43,938
ohh!

495
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:45,212
And they'll get it free,

496
00:25:45,213 --> 00:25:47,211
right into their living rooms,

497
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:49,213
free, right into
the living rooms,

498
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:50,805

Sorry, Mr. murdock.

501
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:56,254
Get yourself another artist,

to suit your wife.

503

Let's talk this over.

504
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,190
Come on, please, Abigail,

505
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:03,929

Miss, I'm Rick Todd,

The landlady said we'd
find Abigail Parker here.

509
00:26:10,273 --> 00:26:11,939
She's busy now in surgery.

510
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,938
Good. We'll wait.
Sit down.

If she doesn't
back up your statement,

512

514
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:19,944

515
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:21,206
with the fat lady.

516
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:22,953
Who's got that kind of time?

517
00:26:22,954 --> 00:26:26,619
I'm still excited about
seeing the bat lady.

518

You like the bat lady?

Oh, yeah,

520
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,587
and I just found out
she's for real.

521
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:36,093
Oh, sure, she is.

522
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:39,097
She's a living doll.

523
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,358
Do you...

524
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:41,626
do you know her?

525
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:43,368
Intimately.

526
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:46,669
In fact, she's even
more darling in person.

527
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:48,972
No fooling.

gleaming in the moonlight.

532
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:04,151
What's wrong with your mouth?

533
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:05,956
Is it sore?

534
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,288
No. I thought I felt
a pucker coming on.

535
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,362
Oh.

536
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:14,003
And her eyes,
those magnificent eyes.

537
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:17,701
What's wrong with yours?
You got astigmatism?

538
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:20,103
No. I was just
uncrossing them.

What's the matter
with Abigail's drawings?

542
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,377
Oh, bad, very bad.

543
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:29,047
Look, the legs,
they look like arms.

544
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:31,278
You should see
the bat lady's legs.

545
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,286
Oh, miss?

546
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:36,987
Yes?

Yes, Mr. murdock?

Get me the names

Yes, sir. I'll bring
you the folder.

Did you hear what he said?

556
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:04,946
He needs an artist.

When Bessie comes out, kiss her.

Who wants to kiss her?

You do. I got to
get into that folder.

you can pretend
she's the bat lady.

She might fight you,

but you're doing this for
your kangaroo patrol pal.

I won't only watch
your switchboard,

I'll buzz your lights
and tangle your plugs.

Come here, baby.

Ah, what are we waiting for?

00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,962
Come on.

665
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:48,065
Mr. murdock...

666
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:50,467
I've got a new...

667
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,569
Great idea...
For a new...

668
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:56,072
Comic book!

669
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:57,335
Are you...

670
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,307
Interested?

671
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,112
Um... No. No.

672
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:04,248
Oh.

673
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:05,979
Wait, wait.

674
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:09,245
Maybe an idea
growing out of the brain

675
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:12,457
that probably
lies behind that face

676
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:16,058
may be what my wife's
separate maintenance needs.

677
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:18,061
Ahem.

678
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:21,063
Lad, what's the idea?
Give me the gist of it.

679
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:22,496
Give me the idea.

680
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:25,670
I write about
all my little friends...

681
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,271
little goosey goose

682
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:28,672
and little Freddie field mouse

683
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,274
who live in a little corn field.

684
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:33,276
Now, these little
friends of mine...

685
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:36,278
little goosey goose and
little Freddie field mouse?

686
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:38,121
Uh-huh.

687
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:44,153
See that little window
back there, boy?

688
00:33:44,156 --> 00:33:46,156
Yes, sir.

689
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:48,158
Open it a little...

690
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,160
Then jump.

691
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:50,161
All right.

692
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:51,229
No, no!

693
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,160
I'd like to see
Mr. murdock.

694
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:54,555
Madam, at your service.

695
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:57,566
Then you are responsible
for my son Richard.

696
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,569
Oh, how do you do,
Mrs. murdock?

697
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:01,171
Nice to know you.

698
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:04,509
I'm not Mrs. murdock.
I'm Mrs. John Stilton.

699
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,510
Oh.

700
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:07,141
Ooh!

701
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:09,146
As publisher of<i> the bat lady,</i>

702
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:11,378
you are responsible
for my son's condition.

703
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:14,552
And as I'm chairman of the second
elementary school district,

704
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:18,322
I'm going to file a petition
against your comic book.

705
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:20,123
Before I do, however,

706
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,525
I think you ought to
have the pleasure

707
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:24,088
of my son Richard's company

708
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:25,526
while I go shopping

709
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:27,361
to observe for yourself

710
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:31,596
the effects your horror literature
has on undeveloped minds!

711
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:33,803
But, madam, as a mother,

712
00:34:33,806 --> 00:34:35,806
aren't you a little worried

713
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:38,408
about leaving your
undeveloped mind here?

714
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,340
Your mother is
the one to be worried.

715
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:46,150
Well, uh, Richard, uh...

716
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:48,586
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

717
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,147
Pleased to offer you my hand.

718
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:52,656
Aah!

719
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:53,858
Ow!

00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:55,289
Ow, ow, ow!

721
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,430
What happened?
What's the matter?

722
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,370
Bessie, what floor
is the nurse on?

723
00:35:02,371 --> 00:35:04,767
The second, below
Dr. Stevens' office.

724
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:05,770
Thank you.

Who's that?

This is Richard Stilton.

728
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:16,513
His mother left him here
for developing.

729
00:35:16,515 --> 00:35:18,815
Don't get too close.
He may be poisonous.

730
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:20,577
Why, he's cute.

731
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:23,786
Well, Richard, what
can I do to entertain you?

732
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,589
Not a thing.

733
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:27,160
You're too old for me, mop-head.

734
00:35:27,161 --> 00:35:28,289
Is this a dagger?

735
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:29,893
No, it's a letter opener.

736
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:31,595
It's too sharp to play with.

737
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:33,297
Who wants to play with it?

738

That's no way to behave.

741
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,177
The bat lady wouldn't like that.

742
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:49,179
Who cares about the bat lady?

743
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:51,181
She's too tame.
She stinks.

744
00:35:51,183 --> 00:35:53,551
No blood.
I like blood.

and I'll throw this jug

Look, Niagara falls.

Why don't you two
go on a honeymoon?

00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,246
Yeah.

757
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,620
Thank you for the escort.

758
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:36,555
It's been dandy having
somebody breathe down my neck

759
00:36:36,562 --> 00:36:37,562
for two hours.

760
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:38,963
It's a dandy neck.

761
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:40,504
I wouldn't mind
going on overtime.

762

Same old line, Ricky?

763
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,967
Shh. Man at work.

Look, you're
an unemployed artist,

765

and I'm an unemployed artist.

How about we get together and
rattle our palettes around?

Watch out, girl,
he really rattles.

Aren't you late for something?

Yes, models.

00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:15,932
You understand...
they're people who pose.

780

How about me for the male?

poster, "send this boy to camp?"

It was me.

No, no, no.
Hold her tighter.

Be passionate.
You love her.

Ugh!

00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:57,574
I said tighter,

794
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:59,976
but I didn't say
fracture her rib case.

Now, put your arms around me.

That's it. Now,
bend me back a little.

Now look into my eyes.

Come closer.

00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:24,895
Now pretend you love
my cleave-to lipstick.

Pretend? You sound
like my roommate,

That was uncalled for.

I could have sworn
I heard you call.

00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:57,467
Bye, now.

812
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:58,869
Bye.

813
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:02,006
Let's see, you worked two hours.

814
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,537
That should do it.

815
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:05,942
No. That one
was on the house.

816
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:07,544
It's only a sample

817
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:09,476
to show what you
don't have to be missing.

818
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:11,751
Your humility intrigues me.

819

Miss Parker, aren't you
breathing a little heavy

820
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:18,555
for just a kiss?

821
00:39:18,557 --> 00:39:20,957
You're not
in condition, are you?

822
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,559
What's the matter,

823
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:24,430
all work and no playing around?

824
00:39:24,431 --> 00:39:25,959
Mr. Todd, I'm
breathing heavily

825
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:29,967
because I happen to be a
perfectly normal young woman.

826
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:32,568
My heart beats, my pulse pounds,

827
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:34,571
my blood count is high.

828
00:39:34,573 --> 00:39:39,383
I have all the biological
impulses that anybody else has.

829

00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:39,676
and even romance,

998
00:49:39,677 --> 00:49:41,037
providing it's between

999
00:49:41,045 --> 00:49:42,135
your repulsive characters.

1000
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:43,546
You want something gory...

1001
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:45,548
Like, uh, like the vulture.

1002
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:47,718
Vulture, vulture.
Sounds fresh.

1003
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:49,649
I don't think
there's any character

1004
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:51,654
like that in comic books.

1005
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:54,256
You mean, you've never
heard of the vulture?

1006
00:49:54,258 --> 00:49:57,258
Well, how could I?
You just told me.

1007
00:49:57,261 --> 00:49:59,661
When did you dream this up?

1008
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:01,664
I didn't dream this up.

1009
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:04,666
I didn't know he
dreamed original dreams.

1010
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:07,269
Stop babbling, boy.
Who dreams? What dreams?

1011
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:08,671
Tell me about the vulture,

1012
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:11,141
and give me that Gore
pouring out.

1013
00:50:11,142 --> 00:50:12,712
Oozing out, Mr. murdock!

1014
00:50:12,713 --> 00:50:14,710
Oozing out of his tail!

1015
00:50:14,712 --> 00:50:16,446
Eeee!

1016
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,607
Don't pay any attention to them.

1017
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:20,216
Oozing out of whose tail?

1018
00:50:20,218 --> 00:50:21,678
Vincent...
Vincent the vulture.

1019
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:23,616
Oh, Vincent the vulture.
I see.

1020
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:26,021
What happens next?
Tell me.

1021
00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:27,424
I can't tell you now.

1022
00:50:27,425 --> 00:50:29,055
Well, why not?

1023
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:32,629
I got to go home
and have him sleep on it...

1024
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:35,230
I got to go home
and sleep on it.

1025
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:37,373
Eugene, you dream boy, you.

1026
00:50:39,303 --> 00:50:40,703
[Applause]

1027
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:46,275
The better America forum
<i>is on the air!</i>

1028
00:50:46,277 --> 00:50:48,037
You nervous, Eugene?

1029
00:50:48,046 --> 00:50:49,446
No.

1030
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:52,047
No, just my knees are nervous.

1031
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:54,450
They've never been
on television before.

1032
00:50:54,452 --> 00:50:56,622
Tonight,
<i>the better America forum</i>

1033
00:50:56,623 --> 00:50:59,621
brings to your attention
the monumental problem

1034
00:50:59,624 --> 00:51:02,092
confronting
your children today...

1035
00:51:02,093 --> 00:51:04,293
the ever-growing
threat and menace

1036
00:51:04,295 --> 00:51:06,695
of the cheap pulps
found on all newsstands

1037
00:51:06,697 --> 00:51:09,697
masquerading under
the titles of comic books.

1038
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,300
Now, to aid us
in our discussion,

1039
00:51:12,303 --> 00:51:14,271
we have enlisted the aid

1040
00:51:14,272 --> 00:51:15,812
of Professor
Samuel D. Roberts,

1041
00:51:15,813 --> 00:51:18,437
child psychologist
Mrs. Newton Geudel,

1042
00:51:18,443 --> 00:51:20,643
miss Abigail Parker.

1043
00:51:20,645 --> 00:51:22,645
Miss Parker, artist and writer,

1044
00:51:22,647 --> 00:51:25,247
was until recently
herself a contributor

1045
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:26,649
to comic books.

1046
00:51:26,651 --> 00:51:28,318
She knows the pressures

1047
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,319
brought by
unscrupulous publishers.

1048
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:33,321
We're fortunate also in
having miss Parker's guest...

1049
00:51:33,324 --> 00:51:34,724
Mr. Eugene Fullstack.

1050
00:51:34,725 --> 00:51:35,715
[Applause]

1051
00:51:35,726 --> 00:51:37,326
Mr. Fullstack,
I understand,

1052
00:51:37,328 --> 00:51:40,328
has been reading
comic books for 15 years.

1053
00:51:40,331 --> 00:51:42,331
He's come at
miss Parker's request

1054
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:43,873
to give his firsthand knowledge

1055
00:51:43,874 --> 00:51:46,736
of what can happen
to the human brain

1056
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:49,737

01:02:37,121 --> 01:02:38,788
I take the numbers...

1315
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:41,119
the day, month,
and year I was born,

1316
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:43,755
I add to the day, month,
and year Eugene was born.

1317
01:02:43,761 --> 01:02:45,761
I divide that with
my street address,

1318

then add that to my
social security number.

Eugene's social security number,

1320
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:52,273
then multiply that by the number
of dancing lessons I take.

01:02:52,274 --> 01:02:55,238
The calories I eat in one
day I subtract from that,

1322
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:58,039
then multiply by how tall I
am, and that's the answer.

Oh, oh, pain.

We're in trouble a little here.

You're in trouble?
I'll help.

1504

Put your foot under hers.

Brace her foot up.

That's it, that's it.

Under her?

1508
01:14:52,689 --> 01:14:53,689
Lean back.

1509
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:54,690
That way?

No, wait a second.

Now brace your foot up over.

That'll fix everything, huh?

Lady, would you help here?

Just grab... see my foot
down there?

Hold it and pull it up.
That's it.

That's good, hold it there.

Hold my foot. Maybe I'll
slip this one out...

no, hold it.
Hold everything.

all right.

Wait, we'll get another lady.

Sure, we need another lady.

Give me this hand.
Hold on there.

1529
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:38,100
Let go of that foot.
Is there another lady?

1530
01:15:38,101 --> 01:15:40,936
That's fine.
You hold on to her.

1531
01:15:40,937 --> 01:15:42,937
Good, like that. Lady!
One lady.

1532

the edge of the...

I know.

Give me your hand. Good.
Now hold on to him.

That's fine. Now bring
this leg over.

no, bring this leg down here.

Now, look.

Just get that leg
over in this side.

That's fine.
Now bring it around there.

Can you help her
with this leg there?

1545

Maybe if she, uh...

Wait, I tell you what,

I'll see you
at the apartment later.

I don't think so.
I may have lunch here.

All right. See you later.
Oh, what a mess.

is the final test

of our new power formula.

1554
01:17:02,852 --> 01:17:04,252
We can safely predict

01:17:04,253 --> 01:17:06,853
our nation will be the first

1556
01:17:06,856 --> 01:17:09,256
to break through the
earth's gravitational pull

1557
01:17:09,258 --> 01:17:10,858
and establish a space station.

Colonel Drury here
has been in charge

of developing
our secret power formula.

longer, General Traynor.

Well, that's half
of our formula!

1563
01:17:27,377 --> 01:17:28,977
My son bought that
at the corner newsstand

1564
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:30,646
last night.

1565

You can't buy

company in New York

on the phone immediately.

01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:41,056
Yes, general,

1572
01:17:41,057 --> 01:17:43,057
I have the comic book before me.

1573
01:17:43,059 --> 01:17:45,429
I'll put my best men
on the assignment.

1574
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:47,396
This may be a clever way

1575
01:17:47,397 --> 01:17:49,397
of conveying our
secrets to the enemy.

1576
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:50,999
Find out if they have

1577
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,400
the remainder of our
space station formula.

Of course,

1580
01:18:03,246 --> 01:18:05,746
the United States wouldn't
publish top secrets

1581

in a comic book,

1582
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:09,750
but the formula works
to a point.

1583
01:18:09,752 --> 01:18:12,152
It's a trap. We
cannot take a chance.

If this cartoonist has
the mathematics equations

to take a space station

beyond the earth's atmosphere,

1587
01:18:18,961 --> 01:18:21,961
we must take the chance.

1588
01:18:21,964 --> 01:18:24,004
All right.

Get to him quickly, directly.

I'm looking for a man.

They never let me
dress with the girls.

1604

His name is Todd.

Oh, he isn't here.
He's my roommate.

Oh, here you are.

Thank you.

Will he be long?

1611
01:19:46,015 --> 01:19:47,405
I don't know.

1612
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:49,416
Is there anything I can do?

1613
01:19:49,418 --> 01:19:51,987
I doubt it.

1614
01:19:51,988 --> 01:19:53,818
I'll wait.

1615
01:19:56,959 --> 01:19:59,359
I'd like to stay and
check my thermometer,

1616
01:19:59,362 --> 01:20:03,962
but I have to go see a
man about a costume.

1617
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:09,470
We're a smash, Todd!

1618
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:11,072
The presses are
working overtime!

1619

We're selling on the
black market in Boston!

1620
01:20:13,476 --> 01:20:15,976
I told you that Zuba
was all girl!

1621
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:17,546
Look at her!

1622
01:20:17,547 --> 01:20:20,407
By the way, you've met my,
uh, cousin, haven't you?

1623
01:20:20,416 --> 01:20:23,216
When you meet her, you
meet your whole family.

1624
01:20:23,219 --> 01:20:25,249
Look! The vulture
brass knuckles!

1625
01:20:25,254 --> 01:20:26,854
Guaranteed no rust!

1626
01:20:26,856 --> 01:20:28,256
And look at this, Rick.

1627
01:20:28,257 --> 01:20:29,987
Right according to
your specifications,

1628
01:20:29,992 --> 01:20:31,392
just the way you drew it.

01:20:38,367 --> 01:20:39,397
Mmm!

1632
01:20:39,402 --> 01:20:41,136
Real nice, very nice.

1633
01:20:41,137 --> 01:20:43,997
A couple more issues, we'll
make them forget Hitler.

1634
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:46,836
Now, wait, don't get
squeamish, Todd.

1635
01:20:46,843 --> 01:20:50,043
Why don't you, your
daughter, and your niece

1636
01:20:50,046 --> 01:20:51,446
tell your wife off?

01:20:53,049 --> 01:20:57,349
I got to go, go, go.

1639
01:20:57,353 --> 01:21:00,021
Say goodbye
to your... Uncle.

1640
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:01,322
But you...

1641
01:21:13,002 --> 01:21:15,302
what's going on down there?

1642
01:21:15,304 --> 01:21:20,374
[Jimmy Stewart] Well, it seems
like Todd told murdock off,

1643
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:22,136
and he's leaving.

1644
01:21:22,144 --> 01:21:26,614
Of course, I can't see so
well from this rear window.

1645
01:21:36,259 --> 01:21:37,259
Todd.

1646
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:38,460
Yeah?

1647
01:21:41,197 --> 01:21:42,997
Secret service?

1648
01:21:45,434 --> 01:21:47,034
I've been telling you.

1649
01:21:47,036 --> 01:21:49,036
Eugene dreams the space formula.

1650
01:21:49,038 --> 01:21:50,968
He doesn't know what
he's saying in his sleep.

1651
01:21:50,973 --> 01:21:52,973
We've got to know
if the formula's

1652
01:21:52,975 --> 01:21:54,975
tucked away in his subconscious.

1653
01:21:54,977 --> 01:21:56,377
Check on Fullstack's dreams.

1654
01:21:56,379 --> 01:21:57,979
Take the tape recorder.

1655
01:21:57,980 --> 01:21:59,510
If they go,

1656
01:21:59,515 --> 01:22:02,075
then I got to tell Eugene
I'm doing the vulture.

1657
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:03,984
We'll be through as pals.

1658
01:22:03,986 --> 01:22:06,986
Can't they come after
when he's asleep?

1659
01:22:06,989 --> 01:22:08,989
All right, but I'm
holding you responsible.

1660
01:22:08,991 --> 01:22:10,691
Don't let Fullstack
out of your sight.

1661
01:22:10,693 --> 01:22:12,993
We don't want him
dreaming for our enemies.

1662
01:22:12,995 --> 01:22:14,995
I'll stick with him, sir.

1663
01:22:14,997 --> 01:22:16,957
I appreciate
your cooperation, Todd.

1664
01:22:16,966 --> 01:22:19,366
The president might invite
you to the white house.

1665
01:22:19,368 --> 01:22:20,368
I doubt that.

1666
01:22:20,369 --> 01:22:21,369
Why?

1667
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:24,100
I shoot in the low 70s.

1668
01:22:25,107 --> 01:22:26,267
Nothing.

1669
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:27,975
He must keep the rest
of the formula

1670
01:22:27,977 --> 01:22:29,377
in his head.

1671
01:22:39,388 --> 01:22:41,318
Get him to the
laboratory tonight.

1672
01:22:41,324 --> 01:22:42,524
Don't worry.

1673
01:22:55,071 --> 01:22:56,071
Hello.

1674
01:22:56,072 --> 01:22:57,372
Hello.

1675
01:22:57,373 --> 01:22:59,207
Mr. Todd?

1676
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:02,338
If I'm in the right
apartment, I'm Mr. Todd.

1677
01:23:02,345 --> 01:23:04,345
I am Mrs. Thomas Curtis.

1678
01:23:04,347 --> 01:23:07,347
Your roommate let me in.
He left.

1679
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:09,480
That's the smartest thing
he's ever done.

1680
01:23:09,485 --> 01:23:12,085
I've heard what
a fine artist you are,

1681
01:23:12,088 --> 01:23:15,418
and I came to see
your paintings.

1682
01:23:15,424 --> 01:23:17,294
It's beautiful.

1683
01:23:18,627 --> 01:23:20,327
Lovely.

1684
01:23:22,031 --> 01:23:24,031
I like them very much.

1685
01:23:24,033 --> 01:23:25,433
That makes two of us.

1686
01:23:25,434 --> 01:23:29,037
You see, I would like
to have my portrait painted,

1687
01:23:29,038 --> 01:23:30,438
and after seeing your work,

1688
01:23:30,439 --> 01:23:33,339
I am sure you could do me
very well.

1689
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:35,442
Thank you.
I'll do my best.

1690
01:23:35,444 --> 01:23:38,454
What size portrait would you
want... full-length or bust?

1691
01:23:38,455 --> 01:23:40,447
I had full-length
in mind.

1692
01:23:40,449 --> 01:23:42,219
I'll show you what I mean.

1693
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:46,048
I would like to give
it to my third husband

1694
01:23:46,055 --> 01:23:48,085
as a surprise present.

1695
01:23:52,461 --> 01:23:55,061
My congratulations
to all three of them.

1696
01:23:55,064 --> 01:23:58,466
What do you think of this pose, Mr.
Todd?

1697
01:23:58,467 --> 01:24:01,067
You could do a big
calendar business.

1698
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:03,470
If you don't approve,
what do you suggest?

1699
01:24:03,472 --> 01:24:05,072
I'm not knocking it.

1700
01:24:05,074 --> 01:24:09,477
I think if you had this
arm up a little there.

1701
01:24:09,478 --> 01:24:11,408
That's it.

1702
01:24:11,414 --> 01:24:13,314
And, um...

1703
01:24:13,315 --> 01:24:14,415
Head down.

1704
01:24:14,417 --> 01:24:17,417
Yes, yes. I like this
much better.

1705
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:19,820
You see, I want
something intimate.

1706
01:24:19,822 --> 01:24:22,822
Something I can hang
over the bar.

1707
01:24:22,825 --> 01:24:24,425
With you hanging there,

1708
01:24:24,427 --> 01:24:26,427
they won't need any liquor.

1709
01:24:26,429 --> 01:24:29,429
Could you start working
on me right now?

1710
01:24:29,432 --> 01:24:31,832
Don't you think it's a
little late for that?

1711
01:24:31,834 --> 01:24:33,701
We could go to my house.

1712
01:24:33,702 --> 01:24:35,302
My husband is away,

1713
01:24:35,304 --> 01:24:36,804
and we wouldn't be disturbed.

1714
01:24:36,806 --> 01:24:38,806
We would be quite alone.

1715
01:24:38,808 --> 01:24:40,768
Just the two of us.

1716
01:24:40,776 --> 01:24:42,076
Hey, Rick!

1717
01:24:42,078 --> 01:24:44,446
Who'll put the ice on my neck?

1718
01:24:44,447 --> 01:24:45,847
[Knock knock]

1719
01:24:45,848 --> 01:24:46,848
Hey, Rick!

1720
01:24:46,849 --> 01:24:48,849
If I have a neck left.

1721
01:24:48,851 --> 01:24:50,451
Just a minute, honey.

1722
01:24:50,453 --> 01:24:52,493
Slight intermission,
Mrs. Curtis.

1723
01:24:55,291 --> 01:24:56,491
Well.

1724
01:25:13,242 --> 01:25:15,110
Oh, hello, darling.

1725
01:25:15,111 --> 01:25:16,111
Hi.

1726
01:25:16,112 --> 01:25:17,112
Where's Eugene?

1727
01:25:17,113 --> 01:25:18,246
Eugene?

1728
01:25:18,247 --> 01:25:19,847
I thought I heard you talking.

1729
01:25:19,849 --> 01:25:23,449
Eugene. Oh, well, he's
taking off his clothes,

1730
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:25,452
and he's taking a shower.

1731
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:27,861
Oh, well, ask him what
he's wearing tonight.

1732
01:25:27,862 --> 01:25:29,857
Tell him the bat lady
wants to know

1733
01:25:29,859 --> 01:25:30,859
so she'll recognize him.

1734
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:32,590
Okay. I'll ask him.

1735

[Shower starts]

1736
01:25:40,903 --> 01:25:42,470
Hello, Abigail.

1737
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:44,871
Eugene!
You're taking a bath.

1738
01:25:44,874 --> 01:25:46,874
Yeah, 'cause I'm going
to wear my new costume.

1739
01:25:46,876 --> 01:25:49,476
It's the first time
I had my own head.

1740
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:51,348
No, you're taking a bath now.

1741
01:25:51,349 --> 01:25:54,277
All right, Abigail,
but don't rush me.

1742
01:25:54,283 --> 01:25:58,286
Eugene, Abby wants to know
what you're wearing tonight.

1743
01:25:58,287 --> 01:26:00,247
I'm going to wear my...

who's he talking to?

1745
01:26:03,425 --> 01:26:07,325
Yes, who was he talking to?

1746
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:09,429
All right.
I'll tell her.

1747
01:26:16,272 --> 01:26:17,672
What did he say?

1748
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:19,913
He's wearing his Freddie
field mouse costume.

1749
01:26:19,914 --> 01:26:21,839
Why don't I talk to Eugene?

1750
01:26:21,844 --> 01:26:23,714
He's taking a shower.
You'll get...

1751
01:26:23,715 --> 01:26:25,212
you'll get all wet.

1752
01:26:25,214 --> 01:26:26,584
He's taking a shower.

1753
01:26:26,585 --> 01:26:28,449
You'll get all wet.

1754

Got dry in a hurry, didn't you?

1755
01:26:31,187 --> 01:26:33,347
There's no one there.
Just my mother.

1756
01:26:33,355 --> 01:26:35,885
It's a surprise.
She's from Steubendale.

1757
01:26:37,193 --> 01:26:38,193
Oh, mother.

I can explain this, Abby.

Not to me, you can't.

1761

Watch out for the bit
with the suntan oil, mother.

Entertain her?

are you particularly
interested in, Mrs. Curtis?

1772

have peewees.

In Hungary you don't
have peewees.

on her heater

01:28:14,923 --> 01:28:16,923
Tonight after the artists
and models ball...

1800
01:28:18,827 --> 01:28:23,697
What if Mrs. Curtis doesn't
want to go to the ball?

1801
01:28:23,699 --> 01:28:24,899
What?

1802
01:28:26,402 --> 01:28:27,772
I can't do that,
Mr. Samuels.

1803
01:28:27,773 --> 01:28:30,500
I'm in love with another girl.

1804
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:35,677
It's my duty to the
United States of America?

1805
01:28:35,678 --> 01:28:37,408
Are you sure?

1806
01:28:38,781 --> 01:28:40,548
If I'd known that,

1807
01:28:40,549 --> 01:28:43,818
I'd have joined the FBI instead
of the kangaroo patrol.

1808
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:45,019
Okay.

1809
01:28:46,021 --> 01:28:47,621
Oh, boy.

1810
01:29:03,539 --> 01:29:04,839
Aah!

1811
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:07,110
You bucking for a
nosebleed or something?

1812
01:29:07,111 --> 01:29:09,109
I can't keep this
dickey down, Ricky.

1813
01:29:09,111 --> 01:29:12,511
Anybody tell you dickeys
went out with horse cars?

1814
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:14,514
If you're going to rent,

1815
01:29:14,516 --> 01:29:15,916
rent a modern dress shirt,

1816
01:29:15,918 --> 01:29:17,518
something like about 1922.

1817
01:29:17,519 --> 01:29:18,919
There. That does it.

1818
01:29:18,921 --> 01:29:20,521
Thank you very...

1819
01:29:20,522 --> 01:29:21,922
thank you very much.

1820
01:29:21,924 --> 01:29:23,524
I got to look nice,

1821
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:25,825
'cause I'm meeting the
bat lady tonight.

1822
01:29:25,828 --> 01:29:27,528
If she's wearing a bustle,

1823
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:29,529
you'll make
a dandy-looking pair.

1824
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:30,531
Yeah.

1825
01:29:30,532 --> 01:29:32,032
There.

1826
01:29:32,034 --> 01:29:34,104
Oh, what am I going to do, Rick?

1827
01:29:34,105 --> 01:29:36,541
Every time the bat lady
comes near me,

1828
01:29:36,542 --> 01:29:37,938
she'll get an uppercut.

1829
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:39,540
I got an idea.

1830
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:42,941
Button the dickey
on the top of the shorts.

1831
01:29:42,945 --> 01:29:44,535
Let me do it.

1832
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:45,946
Wait a minute.

1833
01:29:45,948 --> 01:29:47,548
Here?
This button, huh?

1834
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:50,079
Yeah, that will
hold everything down.

1835
01:29:51,487 --> 01:29:52,887
Oh, yeah.
Thanks, Rick.

1836
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:54,488
Good.
Now, hurry up.

1837
01:29:54,490 --> 01:29:55,960
We're going to be late.

1838
01:29:55,961 --> 01:29:59,958
I'll be there as soon
as I put my shoes on.

1839
01:29:59,962 --> 01:30:02,962
Wonder if I can walk at all.

1840
01:30:02,965 --> 01:30:04,865
Something's crooked.

1841
01:30:04,867 --> 01:30:06,967
I think something's been...

1842
01:30:06,969 --> 01:30:08,799
wait, this way.

1843
01:30:08,804 --> 01:30:10,404
Over there.
That's it.

1844
01:30:10,406 --> 01:30:12,766
Something's
pulling me. Yeah.

1845
01:30:12,775 --> 01:30:15,805
I'll be right...
right there, Rick.

1846
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:34,458
Wait, Bessie.

1847
01:30:34,463 --> 01:30:35,863
You were great.

1848
01:30:35,864 --> 01:30:37,764
It's just the numerology.

1849
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:43,570
Hurry up, girls.
Step on it.

1850
01:30:43,572 --> 01:30:44,972
Artists and models number.

1851
01:30:44,973 --> 01:30:47,013
Todd, Fullstack, you're on.

1852
01:30:48,944 --> 01:30:50,478
We'll be pals forever?

1853
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:51,609
Pals forever.

1854
01:30:51,613 --> 01:30:52,681
Scout's honor?
Scout's honor.

1855
01:30:52,682 --> 01:30:53,681

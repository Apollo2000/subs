I wish you success.

74

It's no joke. I've been drafted.

75

Oh my, drafted?

76
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,863
Don't you intellectuals know that slogan?

"The people have a duty to the nation."

78
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,831
Then will you send your son to do his duty?

79
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,875
My son has tuberculosis!

80
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:53,171
If not for that, he could serve
in the rear like you, earn money,

81
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,426
and support
the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity...

82
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:58,100

83
00:07:58,812 --> 00:07:59,643

Are you going to play this music all night?

87

We're sending boys off

Don't you have any nice jazz?

89
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,190
Why?

90
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,651
You know that jazz is banned.
You want me arrested?

91
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,203
Who's going to arrest you?

92
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:22,454
This room is filled with high-ranking,
well-connected people.

93

We need some fun for once.

94

You want some fun?

95
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,921
That'll cost you a bit of hazard pay.

On the stage.

100
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,314
If he wants to stay out of jail,
tell him to come down and find me.

101
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,238
Huh, why? Did he make trouble again?

102
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:39,027
Damned idiot fooled around
with a section chief's wife!

103
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,168

Okay!

108
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,924
Give her a hand!

109
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,140
No, come on!

00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,640

00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,319
Stand up!

115

Spin! Spin, you brat.

116
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,376
Wait, Daddy! Wait!

<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

118
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,798
The section chief's wife likes my music.

119
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,131
She kept offering to buy dinner,
how can I turn it down?

120
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,476
And the theater owner
kept telling me to meet her.

121
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,845
All we did was eat.

122
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:51,808
If you get drafted for
this, what will she do?

123
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,522
I'm not going to be drafted!

124
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:05,238
You think you'll get away
with touching a section chief's wife?

125
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,948
Then today you play jazz?

126
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,418
Did you bring it?

127
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:27,844
Here.

128
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,059
It's nine musicians, including you.

129
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,483
And your daughter makes ten.

130
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:42,067
There'll be nothing left for me
and my police colleagues.

131
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:47,205
I'm always in your debt, Mr. Sugiyama.

132
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,077
Look.

133
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:54,913
I'll arrange a bribe for you and your band.

134
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,458
I'm asking around
the offices of Japanese factories.

135
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:02,761
Explain the situation to your band well.

136
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,214
And bring in some more cash.

137
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:09,385
You always said you wanted to work in Japan.

138
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:13,223
I heard the army was
driven out of the Philippines again?

139
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,182
Is Japan going to lose?

140
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,187
That's all just talk.
Don't you read the papers?

141
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,360
There are thousands of U. S.
POWs in Japan now.

142
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,285
It'll be over before
the cherry blossoms fall, trust me.

143
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,908
We're going to see cherry blossoms?

144
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:36,705
"12th Feb 1945 Ferry to Shimonoseki"

145
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,710
Get off, then.

146
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,133
Let's go.

147
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,388
God, what a smell.

148
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,058
You should be sucking on your mom's breasts!

149
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,235
What's a kid like you doing on this boat?

150
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:04,986
I was on my way home, and the town clerk

151
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:08,069
puts me in a truck saying
I'm about to earn money.

152
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,027
Okay, Okay.

153
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,738
Couldn't even tell my parents before leaving.

154
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:15,623
Tell me about it.
They dragged me off on my wedding night.

155
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,452
As a newlywed?

156
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:20,256
I am still hard down there
and already forgetting her face.

157
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,670
You in the glasses, how'd you end up here?

158
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,092
I go to Keijo University.

159
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,044
Whoa!

160
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,630
You an intellectual?

161
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:32,014
Better than being drafted
as a student soldier.

162
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:37,432
I heard if you work like crazy
for one year, you get a house?

163
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,891
Even still,

164
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,773
how could they drag off pre-pubescent boys?

165
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,776
Snatching them from the fields,
or when they're out wrestling.

166
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,528
Give me the case.

167
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:51,658
When the boat lands, we'll ditch these guys.

168
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,239
- So bear it until then.
- Okay.

169
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,996
All of you brought cash?

170
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,535
Take it out.

171
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,467
This is our lifeline.

172
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,503
Gimme that.

173
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:12,804
- If we lose this we're dead, okay?
- Okay.

174
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,649
Dad, where are we really going?

175
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,069
You'll see later. Stop asking me!

176
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,198
You asshole!

177
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,319
There's a fight.

178
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:32,782
Is that Choi Chil-sung?

179
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,329
The famous gangster?

180
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:39,285
Stupid Koreans...
can't help but fight each other.

181
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,295
(Stop fighting! Calm down!)

182
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,298
Sohee!

183
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,224
Go away! Go!

184
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:07,237
(Any more trouble,
we'll call it a riot and start shooting.)

185
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,236
What the fuck is he saying?

186
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,487
Hey!

187
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,862
Can anyone here speak Jap?

188
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:18,082
If you freak out again
they'll start shooting.

189
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,576
So shut the fuck up and calm down.

190
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,536
How'd your mouth get so filthy?

191
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,747
Is it as filthy between your legs?

192
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,925
Did you ever see between my legs?

193
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,469
- Did you?
- Do you even know who you're talking to?

194

(Sit down!)

195
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,595
You look like gangsters from some Seoul slum.

196
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:40,805
So if the Japs slap you around,
you take it out on Korean girls?

197
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,896
(Quiet! Sit down!)

198
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,987
All right, just let go.

199
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,484
Sit down, guys.

200
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,699
I said sit!

201
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,738
Not much worth grabbing there anyway.

202
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:00,996
Your poor mom probably felt happy
when you came out with balls.

203
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,708
Wow, she made a fool of him.

204
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,623
Stick out too much, and people hate you.

205
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,084

206

(She sang what's playing right now.)

467

I can sing and dance,
play instruments, whatever!

468

I can clean and do laundry!

He asked what you did in Korea.

471
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:36,298
I played music in Seoul. The Yamamura Band.

472
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:40,302
(She performed at the Yamamura Band.)

473

I'm trying my best.

481
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,676
You've got higher marks than the Americans.

482
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:06,255
The Seoul infiltration operation
you've been planning...

483
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:10,013
I'm sorry, but we need
you for something else.

484
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:14,313
Some OSS intelligence was leaked to our side.

485

The blast radius is up to 200km.

488
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,819
If they drop that from a B-29
onto the Japanese mainland...

489
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,026
That's all unconfirmed talk for now.

490

The point is, the Soviets
are about to invade.

The U. S. has already taken Okinawa.

492
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:36,956
If the Soviets join in,
Japan won't last long.

493
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,957
It's time to focus on winning the war,
not the battle.

494
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,464
For a speedy liberation,
we must join together.

495
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,179
Yoon Hak-chul.

496
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,384
Only he can resolve the conflicts

497
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:54,971
between all the factions fighting
for Korean independence.

498
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,227
He handled fundraising at the KPG,

499
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:59,479
but two years ago he was
caught by the Japanese

500
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,356
and disappeared without a trace.

501
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:04,609
We assumed he was executed without trial,

502
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:08,242
<i>but according to U. S. intel
he was detained near Nagasaki</i>

503
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,201
<i>at Hashima Coal Mine.</i>

504
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:13,323
Go bring back Mr. Yoon.

505
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:18,169
"We will always be together. Our Hashima."

506
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,584
Gather around, everyone.

507
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,760
If we screw up again,
we'll be back in the mines.

508
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,886
Do your best! And smile!

509
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:36,516
If you don't smile I'll have Chil-sung
take you back to the mine.

510
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,313
Get ready, quick!

511
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,270
Hey, why don't you eat that?

512
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,230
Raw eggs are gross.

513
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,237
Eat when I tell you, kid!
It's great for your throat.

514
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,660
Some people can't eat at all! Hurry up!

515
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:56,661
Hey!

516
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:59,752
Abracadabra... ta-dah!

517
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:02,751
Look at that grin.

518
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,549
If you're gonna eat, then pay for it!

519
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:08,878
Newbies who arrived today,
just follow the man in front!

520
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:12,966
Fuckers don't feed us crap.
The fuck is he blabbering about?

521
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,925
Isn't that dynamite? What'll you do with it?

522
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,011
Stop sputtering and be quiet!

523
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:20,978
The liquid that seeps out is sweet.

524
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,476
Need to eat at least that to survive.

525
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:26,062
What if your stomach explodes?

526
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:28,405
Give me a taste!

527
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,199
Help me here!

528
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,292
It's okay.

529
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:52,805
It's just the coal dust in my lungs.

530
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,008
Sir, are you okay?

531
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,387
I'm fine!

532
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,354
Hey, there's gas coming out!

533
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,641
So what?

534
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:06,694
Block off the gas! And pump out sea water!

535
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:10,068
(At the center of Japan's leadership)

536
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,942
(in the Great East Asian War
is Hashima Coal Mine!)

537
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:13,942
<i>(Long live the Emperor!)</i>

538
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,573
<i>(Long live the Japanese Empire!)</i>

539
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,529
<i>(For Hashima Mine and)</i>

540
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:19,616
<i>(its executives returning
to the head office!)</i>

541
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,076
(Cheers!)

542
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:35,386
Rock, scissors, paper! Rock! Rock!

543
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:37,808
Okay, your turn.

544
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:54,028
You okay?

545
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,698
Support his back.

546
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,951
Are you hurt?

547
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,381
Hey kid, out of the way!

548
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,257
Kid!

549
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,009
Look out!

550
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,143
Huh? What's that noise?

551
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:48,879
Explosion!

552
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:52,083
Run out quick! Bring your tools!

553
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:54,422
Don't drop your tools, bring them!

554
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,969
(Thank you.)

555
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,092
(Thank you very much.)

556
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:01,884
(Thank you very much.)

557
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,482
(Thank you very much.)

558
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:18,989
(How many times has Mine No. 2 caught fire?)

559
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:22,116
(Do I need to step in
every time this happens?)

560
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,413
(What about the passage to Mine No.3?)

561
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,540
(It hasn't spread there yet.)

562
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:37,094
(How much is Mine 2 producing?)

563
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,837
(It has the lowest production.)

564
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,969
(We're already 1100 meters
below the seafloor, )

565
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,302
(so it'll be hard to mine deeper.)

566
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:45,348
Save me.

567
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:46,895
Save the young ones first!

568
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:50,941
Mr. Yoon! You must go up!

569
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:54,645
Don't let anyone die! Not one!

570
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:01,990
(That's the Korean section, right?)

571
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:06,407
(Seal them off.
Prevent damage spreading to other mines.)

572
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,627
There are people here! You bastards!

573
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,750
There are people here!

574
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,470
(Sir, Yoon Hak-chul is in the mine!)

575
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:26,893
(Out of the way!)

576
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,595
(I told you not to put him in the mine!)

577
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:32,808
(What if he dies and the Koreans riot?)

578
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,270
(By whatever means necessary, get him out!)

579
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,492
Hold on just a bit!

580
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,749
You gonna work all day? Huh?

581
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,123
They're waiting for you!

582
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:59,463
(Jong-gu! There's a problem in Mine 2!)

583
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:05,015
Damn, I worked all night!
Why'd they have to wake me up?

584
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:08,139
Isn't that where we plugged
the gas leak before?

585
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:12,981
Hey, just shut your mouth and follow orders!

586
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:16,902
Ah, are you back on duty?

587
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:21,948
Fuck!

588
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,484
You sure this connects to Mine 3?

589
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,195
Shouldn't you know that?

590
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:27,245
What? You prick!

591
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,162
Blast through it.

592
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,243
What?

593
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:30,624
There's no other way.

594
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,828
We point the gas
at these supports, and light it.

595
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,958
Newbie! Shut the fuck up!

596
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:39,091
There's no guarantee
we can get enough gas here.

597
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:40,293
You know...

598
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:45,381
I hid this thing here.

599
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,521
- We can't drill any deeper.
- We can't!

600
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,645
Gas keeps leaking, what if there's a fire?

601
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:59,854
That's why we called you technicians!

602
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:01,689
Okay, okay...

603
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:33,936
It's going in!

604
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:34,934
Keep drilling!

605
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:36,390
Drill! Drill!

606
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:43,572
Pull!

607
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:44,948
Pull it!

608
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:57,411
<i>(The Koreans heard there was an accident, )</i>

Wait a minute! You give me this.

632
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:28,589
You're in charge of toilets now.

633
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,545
You'll scoop piss and shit!

641
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:35,448
You got trained by the Americans,
but without their help

642
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:38,497
you think you can escort Mr.
Yoon out of here?

643
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:41,283
The plan was to use the network here

644
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:44,503
and contact Korean agents
at OSS headquarters.

645

Through an agent
planted on the food ship that stops here

646
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:52,052
we'll go by ship to the U. S. base in Okinawa.

How do we know you're not on their side?

648
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,600
You say you're OSS-trained resistance?

649
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:03,723
I was a student soldier
sent to Japanese unit 7991 in China,

650
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:06,399
then I escaped last July in Xuzhou,

651
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:10,069
and met KLA General Lee
Beom-seok in Chongqing.

652
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:13,899
Did he send any personal message to me?

653
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:18,704
He says he'll treat you
to your favorite trotter stew

654
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:20,739
at Hwapyung Restaurant.

655
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:25,035
When do you plan to move?

656
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:38,469
I'll send in another girl.

657
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,099
Just sit.

658
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:47,062
I said sit! I'm not here for romance.

659
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:48,934
Why not?

660
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:52,608
Do the marks on my chest make you go limp?

661
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,067
Hell...

662
00:49:55,159 --> 00:50:00,325
Don't you need a Korean to complain to,
to breathe easier?

663
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:07,169
Fuck... even worse than the Japs

664
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,871
are these damned mosquitos.

665
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,812
At first I was dragged to China.

666
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:39,239
I had no idea. They said I was going to work.

667
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:43,117
They drove me to a Japanese army base.

668
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:49,704
Hell, the mosquitos bit me like crazy.

669
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:53,423
Some mosquito bites can kill a person.

670
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:58,212
One bite, and your whole
body swells with fever.

671
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:01,715
However much you drink, your insides burn.

672
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,468
There was a girl from Heungyang.

673
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:07,808
<i>The Japanese said
she was pretending to be sick,</i>

674
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:11,812
<i>put her on nails and
rolled her back and forth.</i>

675
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,029
<i>She died in front of everyone.</i>

676
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:20,568
I was too scared to tell them I was sick.

677
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:24,746
Figured I'd rather die fast, so I drank lye.

678
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:29,493
It was a Japanese doctor
who stopped me from dying.

679
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:34,423
But then a Korean pimp washed me

680
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,171
and threw me right back
at those Japanese guys.

681
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:46,143
It was a fucking Korean town clerk
who sent me to that comfort station!

682
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:49,517
When the unit retreated, I barely escaped,

683
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:52,941
but that Korean pimp caught and sent me here!

684
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,773
So I need a Korean to complain to?

685
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,942
To breathe easier?

686
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,784
Biting the hand that feeds you.

687
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,455
You need to control your temper.

688
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:15,790
Sooner or later, things will get better.

689
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:48,739
Fuck!

690
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:53,042
Are you doing a lousy job on purpose?

691
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,461
Try finding any guy who
won't get off on this!

692
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,709
Dragging me out of the hospital to do this...

693
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,756
Okay, here.

694
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:02,961
I send out so many of these,
why does so little come back?

695
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:05,012
Damned guards cut the rations.

696
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,432
You're not hoarding it yourself?

697
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:08,599
Shit...

698
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:12,603
Bro, just one cigarette.

699
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,730
You still didn't pay for last month's.

700
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:20,108
The damned Japanese raised
their pension funds or whatever!

701
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,779
We all had them raised!

702
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,949
So control your gambling!
If you're broke, just sleep.

703
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:28,286
Wait, pay me more!

704
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:35,460
Dammit.

705
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,333
Give this to the attendant for 10 cigarettes.

706
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:39,881
Yes, sir.

707
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:47,880
Manager Shimazaki is calling you.

708
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,481
Sohee!

709
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,274
What is it? Oh no...

710
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:09,907
- A splinter.
- Be more careful, kid!

711
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,543
What's that smell?

712
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,524
(I've been thinking of this for a while.)

713
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:43,611
(After today's accident, )

714
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:46,405
(I thought I should meet you)

715
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:48,074
(and propose something, )

716
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,155
(before it's too late.)

717
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:51,615
(I see.)

718
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:54,782
(About your daughter...)

719
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,287
<i>(In the recent U. S. bombing
of our head office, )</i>

720
00:54:57,377 --> 00:55:01,542
<i>(Chiba-san lost his daughter.)</i>

721
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,916
(Rather than having her stay here,
where it's so dangerous, )

722
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:06,338
<i>(I was thinking)</i>

723
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:09,796
<i>(to send her to Chiba-san
as an adopted daughter.)</i>

724
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,260
(Mr. Lee.)

725
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:14,600
(We're in a war.)

726
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,933
(In wartime, winners don't always survive.)

727
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:21,441
(Survivors are true winners.)

728
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:26,024
<i>(On the next freight ship out, )</i>

729
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,200
<i>(let's send Sohee.)</i>

730
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:32,069
Huh?

731
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,539
Wow!

732
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:51,512
<i>Meeting in this world of woe,</i>

733
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:56,844
<i>what is your wish?</i>

734
00:55:56,937 --> 00:56:05,107
<i>Will being rich make you happy?</i>

735
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,527
Airplane!

736
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:13,948
The post office key?

737
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:17,830
We'll pay whatever you want.

738
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,829
Hell, how would you know what I want?

739
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,455
We'll give you this in advance.

740
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:27,916
Wow, advance pay?

741
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:31,340
I need to know what this is about.

742
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:34,176
We need to check a package.

743
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,979
I don't team up with people who keep secrets.

744
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,231
If you need to check a package,

745
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:50,189
isn't it easier to just bribe
one of the labor officers?

746
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:53,070
- The thing is...
- We need the telegraph.

747
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,072
The telegraph?

748
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:00,957
Know how to use it?

749
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:05,002
Just get us the key.

750
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:10,209
A newbie wants to use the telegraph.

751
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:14,971
A Korean who looks like
an independence leader bribes me...

752
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,308
What's going on here?

753
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,680
Forget it, then.

754
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:26,892
I already know,

755
00:57:26,902 --> 00:57:29,110
- how can I forget?
- Quiet!

756
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:35,776
Should I go ask the boss to look into this?

757
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:40,613
Park Mu-young!

758
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:44,125
Mr. Yoon will escape from here.

759
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:50,548
Hey Gang-ok,
all we need is the key, no trouble.

760
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,466
You decide.

761
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:55,011
If you don't cooperate,

762
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,926
then we'll kill you.

763
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,598
(Hey, Yamamura!)

764
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:03,557
(What are you doing out past curfew?)

765
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:13,062
(Where have you been?)

766
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:15,656
(I've been looking for you.)

767
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:17,942
(The drawings are done, )

768
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,618
(tell Maeda to see me tomorrow.)

769
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:21,321
(What, already?)

770
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,452
(I want one, too!)

771
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:26,250
(But what are you doing here?)

772
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:31,505
(They're fighting over gambling debts.)

773
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:34,550
(I'm trying to mediate.)

774
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:36,260
(Damn idiots!)

775
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,503
Shake hands!

776
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:43,226
(I'll take care of this, you go on.)

777
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,386
(All right, then.)

778
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:47,980
(Have a good night!)

779
00:58:59,161 --> 00:59:03,155
You don't need to pay,
but I have one condition.

780
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:07,618
When he escapes, take me and my daughter.

781
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,327
Gang-ok!

782
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:12,289
I take it that old man won't be swimming?

783
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:16,877
Since you want the telegraph,
you must have something lined up.

784
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:19,053
Just kill me,

785
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:22,098
or have the Japanese kill you,

786
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:25,052
or take my daughter and me.

787
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:28,058
This time, you decide.

788
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:35,487
If our plan is leaked, I'll kill you myself.

789
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:42,322
One, two, three!

790
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:46,622
One, two, three!

791
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:58,092
Where the hell did he go?

792
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:03,594
Can't he leave me alone?

793
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:06,426
Hey, go to my spot!

794
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,102
Hey painter!

795
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,811
Where's the guy who made me a lock that time?

796
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:14,392
Is he on the night shift?
Why don't I see him?

797
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:15,476
Bang!

798
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,983
They sent him to the tool repair factory...

799
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:18,904
Bang!

800
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:22,279
to work as a technician,
since he's good with tools.

801
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,284
- Bang!
- Tool repair factory? Shit.

802
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,323
(Good afternoon!)

803
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:35,330
(I need a favor from the locksmith.)

804
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:42,883
What brings you out here?
You want another lock?

805
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:46,341
No, I've got a really important key.

806
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,892
I'm scared of losing it, so I'd like a copy.

807
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:49,639
Hand it over.

808
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:52,142
Yes but... I need to bring it back.

809
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,393
Something smells fishy.

810
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:00,275
How come you get all the luck?

811
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:04,988
Which woman's home?

812
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:08,704
You're quick.

813
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:13,831
Her husband carries the key around.

814
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:15,749
You know how it is.

815
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:21,675
(Here you go. See you later!)

816
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:59,500
Hello!

817
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:02,876
We'd still be nice to Sohee
without these gifts.

818
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:06,804
I know, but treat her well!

819
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:20,644
What are you sighing about?

820
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:28,409
I talked to your supervisor lady,

821
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:30,532
so move to her room.

822
01:02:30,622 --> 01:02:33,490
If I call you at night, then run right out.

823
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:37,577
Can't you ask the manager
to let us stay together?

824
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:40,084
Why? Did he do something?

825
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:43,007
It's just that I'm lonely here...

826
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:45,676
The other women tell me I'm annoying

827
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,755
even when the manager takes care of me.

828
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,214
Damned bitches!

829
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:54,097
That's why I told you
to behave well with other people,

830
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,600
and be careful what impression you give!

831
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:00,641
What are you crying about?

832
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:04,274
Don't you know all that I'm doing for you?

833
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:07,732
Think you're the only one who's got it hard?

834
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:11,702
Why do you always say everything's my fault?

835
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:19,327
Never mind. What do I say to you?

836
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:20,748
Anyway...

837
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,504
Always be ready

838
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:25,299
so you can run right out if I call you.

839
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:30,005
Then we can be together, all right?

840
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:32,924
(Got a good movie for us?)

841
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,176
(Yes, a love story!)

842
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:51,112
(Good evening.)

843
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,789
(Want to see a dirty picture?)

844
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:06,169
(Oh good!)

845
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:07,709
(Come this way.)

846
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:47,422
The outside door, the office
and the director's room.

847
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:49,296
You remember my terms?

848
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,553
I have eyes everywhere, you know.

849
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,842
Hey, boss!

850
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:02,062
What is it now?

851
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:04,891
Nothing, I want to show you something.

852
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,647
What the hell? It won't open?

853
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:49,310
Gang-ok, that rat!

854
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,328
Hey, assholes!

855
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:05,709

"Korean Account Records"

877
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:02,675
(Seems the war is going badly.)

878
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:08,681
(When was the last time Japan
used good paper like this?)

879
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:11,901
(What do propaganda pamphlets
have to do with the war?)

880
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:15,650
(The U. S. still has enough money)

881
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:18,820
(to make pamphlets with good paper.)

882
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:23,868
(Aren't wars ultimately won by
those with the most money?)

883
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:28,289
(Give me the relevant documents
for me and the other Koreans.)

884
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:31,419
(Ah...)

885
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:34,711
(More leaflets littering our island.)

886
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:37,008
(Those are bombers.)

887

889
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:09,700

890
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:13,545
<i>(Citizens and employees, )</i>

891
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:18,251
<i>(because of U. S. bombardment,
turn off lights and stay indoors.)</i>

892
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,006
It's time.

893
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:27,013
(Why so cheap this time?)

894
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:35,359
(Too many people involved now,
I want to wrap it up.)

895
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:37,315
(Where's the attendant?)

896
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:00,918
Let's go.

897
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:16,601
Damn those bastards!

898
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:23,149
Sir, it's time for your medicine.

899
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:26,948
Sir?

900
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,748
(Quiet around here.)

901
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:38,497
Sohee!

902
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:42,467
Sohee...

903
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:45,462
(What is it?)

904
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:49,091
(Gang-ok? Come on in.)

905
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,515
(All right. Where's Sohee?)

906
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:53,891
(Quick, Sohee...)

907
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:56,140
(I'll meet Sohee...)

908
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:57,857
(then go to your room.)

909
01:10:04,242 --> 01:10:05,449
Shit.

910
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:09,869
When did you last see Park?

911
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:11,197
What?

912
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,458
Mr. Yoon is missing.

913
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:20,464
I couldn't say goodbye to anyone.

914
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:24,214
What kind of operation is this?

915
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:29,094
I had to keep everything completely secret.

916
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:33,935
And I have something to ask you first.

917
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:39,226
I found Koreans' pay records
in the post office safe.

918
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:42,944
The pensions and bond payments

919
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:45,317
taken from their paychecks

920
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:48,909
don't go to their accounts,
but to someone else's.

921
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:52,363
<i>Your name is entered on their contracts,</i>

922
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:54,991
<i>and half the money flowing into your account</i>

923
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:57,869
<i>is forwarded into Manager
Shimazaki's account.</i>

924
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,121
Are you aware of this?

925
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,502
Since coming here,

926
01:11:03,718 --> 01:11:08,133
<i>I heard that pay is embezzled by
the manager and several others...</i>

927
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:11,465
but an account in my name?

928
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:15,227
<i>Even dead workers' compensation
is going in there,</i>

929
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:19,727
without their families being
told of their deaths.

930
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:24,187
Shimazaki... I never
thought he'd go this far.

931
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:28,775
Looking through the documents,
I kept seeing your signature.

932
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:31,907
Who could have made those files?

933
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:37,241
Didn't it occur to you that
Shimazaki could've made it?

934
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:45,966
No labor strike or escape plan
has ever succeeded here.

935
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:47,759
I wonder why.

936
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:51,804
If you set up a leader of the Koreans,

937
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,136
<i>and then use him,</i>

938
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:56,677
<i>then this kind of control is possible.</i>

939
01:11:58,356 --> 01:12:02,475
Can you explain how a man
caught delivering huge sums for the KLA

940
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:05,982
could have received no
trial from the Japanese,

941
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:08,898
and ended up here?

942
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:13,743
This is just what Shimazaki wanted.

943
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:15,780
Should I answer for you?

944
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:17,114
You fool!

945
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,874
Shimazaki knew someone like you was coming.

946
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,034
You converted.

947
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:24,121
If you weren't on their
side, you'd be in jail.

948
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:25,088
Park Mu-young!

949
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,416
No one will follow you once they find out.

950
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,172
Why do you think

951
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:34,048
Shimazaki agreed to negotiate
over their protection?

952
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,807
Why?

953
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,343
Negotiate?

954
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:42,681
So dragging little boys off to mines
and stealing their money

955
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:44,771
was a negotiation?

956
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:51,653
If you're so convinced of my guilt

957
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,776
then right here,

958
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:59,327
shoot me.

959
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:04,621
You scoundrel! Trying to run off without us?

960
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:06,004
I warned you!

961
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,376
That if you betray me, I'll report you!

962
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:08,043
You stay there!

963
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:09,045
Gang-ok!

964
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:11,130
Listen closely to me.

965
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:14,429
This is an American spy
with no connection to Korea.

966
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:16,340
If you report him,

967
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:17,974
the two of you can escape.

968
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,471
If Shimazaki finds out, you all die!

969
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,477
What was your real goal in coming here?

970
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:22,387
Sohee!

971
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:23,688
When I shout,

972
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:26,187
run to Manager Shimazaki
and tell him everything!

973
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:27,643
He's on Shimazaki's side!

974
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:30,320
Goddamn fuckers!

975
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:32,610
Then when does the ship come?

976
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:33,861
Daddy!

977
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:38,320
Sohee, it's okay. Just stay still.

978
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,326
Why do you take the girl!

979
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:41,497
Let go of her.

980
01:13:41,626 --> 01:13:43,288
Drop the gun first.

981
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:44,584
Sir, are you okay?

982
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:47,287
I'm fine, go watch over our men.

983
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:48,542
Park has betrayed us!

984
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:50,169
Put down the gun, now!

985
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,750
Our men are on the way.

986
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:53,756
Stop being stupid!

987
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:55,341
Try reading this.

988
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:57,222
What kind of plot is this?

989
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:59,057
Shut up, you scoundrel!

990
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:01,344
Coming to save someone like you...

991
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,766
Don't you feel sorry for them?

992
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:06,057
Ito Takamichi Yoon Hak-chul...

993
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:14,273
I will report your treason to
the Provisional Government of Korea.

994
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:28,829
You bastard!

995
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,637
Run, quick!

996
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:21,722
(This way, quick!)

997
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:29,932
(This way!)

998
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:31,642
(Hurry!)

999
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:41,444
(You Koreans, wait there!)

1000
01:15:41,829 --> 01:15:44,242
(Block the Koreans!)

1001
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:50,918
(Shut the gate! Get in, quick!)

1002
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:12,811
Help!

1003
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:26,868
Sook, get up!

1004
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:29,745
You want to die?

1005
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:32,494
Let me go! Sook!

1006
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:38,508
(Stop!)

1007
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:40,718
(Don't shoot!)

1008
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:42,842
(I'm Ito...)

1009
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:49,887
Yoon Hak-chul!

1010
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:17,418
Sir!

1011
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,797
- Sir, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1012
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:23,173
Are you hurt?

1013
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:24,095
How are you?

1014
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:26,468
I'm okay. Let's get away from here.

1015
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:28,300
About that account book...

1016
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:31,603
Don't worry about that.
I'll go back and get it.

1017
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:35,520
Did you see what was in it?

1018
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:41,233
Sir, I believe you to the end.

1019
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:54,826
(Help!)

1020
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:56,620
(Someone help!)

1021
01:17:56,964 --> 01:17:58,500
(Help me!)

1022
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:02,421
That man, he shot...

1023
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:03,752
Quiet!

1024
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:45,419
Sir, are you all right?

1025
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:48,095
Sir, what will we do?

1026
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:51,050
How could this happen to us?

1027
01:18:56,732 --> 01:19:01,443
You there! Did Gang-ok die too?

1028
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:05,906
Someone thought they saw his corpse,
so we're looking...

1029
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:08,608
Gang-ok, where are you?

1030
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:22,372
Dammit!

1031
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,047
Daddy, I'm thirsty.

1032
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:38,930
Why are you giving me that?

1033
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:41,732
- Any food here?
- Probably.

1034
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:53,116
(Drive out the Koreans!)

1035
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:57,324
(Drive out the Koreans!)

1036
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:02,587
(Does the line work?)

1037
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:07,756
(Hold out as long as you
can with the food and water you have.)

1038
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:09,427
(Our manager's unrecoverable!)

1039
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:10,754
(Are you telling us to just die?)

1040
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:13,966
(Yesterday the U. S. dropped
a new bomb on Hiroshima!)

1041
01:20:14,393 --> 01:20:15,759
(A new bomb?)

1042
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:17,469
(Word is coming in)

1043
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:18,929
(that it's tremendously powerful.)

1044
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:20,930
<i>(There's no official report yet, )</i>

1045
01:20:21,025 --> 01:20:23,187
(but it's said there are
100,000 casualties, )

1046
01:20:23,277 --> 01:20:26,816
<i>(and no living thing survived.)</i>

1047
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:36,659
<i>(The Americans have
created something unimaginable.)</i>

1048
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:46,624
(Are we going to lose this war?)

1049
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:49,380
<i>(After Hitler's death and
the fall of Germany, )</i>

1050
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:52,087
<i>(industrialists who helped the Nazis)</i>

1051
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:55,174
<i>(are being lined up
and tried as war criminals.)</i>

1052
01:20:55,267 --> 01:21:01,264
(If you have any materials that
can be used against us, burn them!)

1053
01:21:01,357 --> 01:21:03,895
(If it's a war crimes trial, )

1054
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:07,398
(shouldn't we kill the Koreans
who could testify against us?)

1055
01:21:07,488 --> 01:21:09,775
(That'd be the most effective solution, )

1056
01:21:09,907 --> 01:21:12,024
(but with Shimazaki in that state, )

1057
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:13,866
<i>(can it be done?)</i>

1058
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:18,660
<i>(If you take care of things properly, )</i>

1059
01:21:19,249 --> 01:21:23,960
<i>(then surely you can take his place.)</i>

1060
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:29,833
(Drive out the Koreans!)

1061
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:33,879
(Drive out the Koreans!)

1062
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:46,516
You little prick.

1063
01:21:52,032 --> 01:21:54,194
You ruined everything!

1064
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:06,749
Does it hurt a lot?

1065
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,763
I can't believe this.

1066
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:22,302
(Corpses will be burned to prevent disease, )

1067
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:25,226
(so finish identifying the bodies!)

1068
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:28,899
(What about Japanese corpses?)

1069
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:33,442
(Why is it only us
who are burned like garbage?)

1070
01:22:34,992 --> 01:22:36,984
(So as not to create more panic, )

1071
01:22:37,077 --> 01:22:41,572
(for now, only you and I
must know of the manager's death.)

1072
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:56,711
Take this for now.

1073
01:22:57,723 --> 01:23:01,012
I couldn't find what you described,
so I just took anything.

1074
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:11,647
(I hear a Japanese schoolgirl was murdered.)

1075
01:23:11,904 --> 01:23:14,567
(Korean attendant Song
Jong-gu says he saw it.)

1076
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:16,697
(And the suspect is Korean.)

1077
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:18,782
(That's good news.)

1078
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:24,072
(Now we have a justification
to crack down on the Koreans.)

1079
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:30,704
Hey!

1080
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:39,754
Hey!

1081
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:41,510
Sohee!

1082
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:43,884
Bro, you're alive?

1083
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:45,263
You think I'm dead?

1084
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:48,267
Why'd you want to meet here,
and not the kitchen?

1085
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,399
There's someone
who can't know the two of us are alive.

1086
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:52,896
Have this.

1087
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:55,649
What the hell? Eat this?

1088
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:58,193
Hey, take a can from my bag.

1089
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:00,445
It disappeared in the bombing.

1090
01:24:00,786 --> 01:24:02,948
Huh? What about the cash?

1091
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:05,450
All of it?

1092
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:07,327
Goddammit!

1093
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:11,411
It was a life-or-death situation!

1094
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:13,918
Why didn't you get it? Where have you been?

1095
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:17,333
It's a long story.

1096
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:20,461
Is Yoon asking about me?

1097
01:24:27,771 --> 01:24:29,808
(Until the situation stabilizes, )

1098
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:33,016
(I will carry out the duties
of our wounded manager.)

1099
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:35,606
(During this vicious American attack)

1100
01:24:35,696 --> 01:24:38,154
(when everyone is heartbroken, )

1101
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:40,986
(an innocent, pretty young girl)

1102
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:45,161
(lost her life to a savage
who couldn't control his lust!)

1103
01:24:45,455 --> 01:24:48,619
(Can you see this innocent victim's family?)

1104
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:50,541
(If you've any conscience, come forward!)

1105
01:24:50,627 --> 01:24:54,871
(What evidence do you have
that it was a Korean?)

1106
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:57,874
(Witness, come forward!)

1107
01:24:59,678 --> 01:25:02,136
(Identify the suspect.)

1108
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:15,312
He was with us yesterday!

1109
01:25:15,402 --> 01:25:17,143
You scumbag!

1110
01:25:26,204 --> 01:25:29,572
Don't overdo it, you thug.

1111
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:38,965
Ah, I want some cold soy noodles!

1112
01:25:39,509 --> 01:25:44,095
With savory broth... salt on top.

1113
01:25:44,348 --> 01:25:46,715
I like it better with sugar.

1114
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,018
All right, sugar it is.

1115
01:25:51,938 --> 01:25:54,931
Pull out a mouthful of those noodles...

1116
01:25:57,903 --> 01:26:00,520
With radish kimchi on the side...

1117
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:06,485
Oh, let's stop this!

1118
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:09,074
Only makes me hungrier.

1119
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:14,375
When we get out of here,
let's go eat noodles first.

1120
01:26:16,463 --> 01:26:19,206
Then, we'll go back home?

1121
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:21,336
Of course.

1122
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:24,962
That's why your dad is helping me.

1123
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:27,888
But right now...

1124
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:31,217
there's something I need you to help me with.

1125
01:26:32,354 --> 01:26:34,311
Will you help me?

1126
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,931
(Mr. Yoon.)

1127
01:26:37,526 --> 01:26:40,815
(If you get a chance to leave this island,
you'll take it?)

1128
01:26:41,488 --> 01:26:44,105
(If I take you to the U. S. occupied zone, )

1129
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:46,987
(can you tell them I helped you
to look after the laborers, )

1130
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:50,161
(and supported Korean liberation?)

1131
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:54,787
(If the manager is dead,
you'll probably get his position.)

1132
01:26:55,001 --> 01:26:57,209
(Is that really necessary?)

1133
01:26:57,379 --> 01:26:59,336
(I've thought it over, )

1134
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:03,087
(and we're both smart enough to know)

1135
01:27:03,427 --> 01:27:05,965
(how this war will end.)

1136
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:08,713
(In return for getting you out, )

1137
01:27:09,015 --> 01:27:13,225
(give me the money
you pocketed with the manager.)

1138
01:27:13,812 --> 01:27:16,304
(Can I leave right away?)

1139
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:18,932
(The coal transport ship is almost repaired.)

1140
01:27:19,109 --> 01:27:20,691
(Our communications are back, )

1141
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:23,144
(and it's no problem to
leave here with you, )

1142
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:27,114
(but if I want to take
my family from Nagasaki, )

1143
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:29,654
(I'll have to follow
the head office's command, )

1144
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:33,284
(and deal with all the Koreans.)

1145
01:27:38,545 --> 01:27:40,081
(Deal with?)

1146
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:43,957
<i>(No Korean who remembers what happened here)</i>

1147
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:46,550
<i>(must be allowed to survive.)</i>

1148
01:27:47,179 --> 01:27:50,672
Where did that old man Yoon hide it?

1149
01:28:01,651 --> 01:28:04,143
"Records of Korean laborers"

1150
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:25,165
You lost your position as the Korean leader,

1151
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:30,378
and took out your grudge
against a Japanese girl.

1152
01:28:30,472 --> 01:28:32,259
But she fought back,

1153
01:28:32,349 --> 01:28:35,592
and you strangled her.

1154
01:28:35,685 --> 01:28:39,269
Is that so hard to admit?

1155
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:43,645
Hey! Just say it's true
and sign with your thumbprint.

1156
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:47,228
Then I'll treat you like my older brother.

1157
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:49,817
Song Jong-gu...

1158
01:28:51,034 --> 01:28:53,242
I'm gonna fold you like a blanket,

1159
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:57,704
and chop you into pieces, you prick.

1160
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:02,243
(Gather all the remaining dynamite!)

1161
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:05,375
(Tomorrow we'll put
all the Koreans in the mine.)

1162
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:08,340
Tomorrow morning...

1163
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:12,921
Yamada plans to force all the Koreans
into the mine and kill us.

1164
01:29:13,056 --> 01:29:16,094
Women of course, and even children.

1165
01:29:25,235 --> 01:29:26,396
I beg you.

1166
01:29:30,073 --> 01:29:32,281
I won't ask for myself,

1167
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:35,284
but please take Sohee away from here.

1168
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:44,581
Surely you can manage to take her.

1169
01:29:48,049 --> 01:29:49,665
I'm going to escape.

1170
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:56,467
With all the Koreans here.

1171
01:29:58,351 --> 01:30:00,934
<i>In this place where we sweated and toiled,</i>

1172
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:04,222
<i>we have a right to proper treatment!</i>

1173
01:30:04,691 --> 01:30:08,981
Today's arrest of Choi Chil-sung
as a murder suspect

1174
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:15,196
is no different from
what all us Koreans have suffered!

1175
01:30:16,202 --> 01:30:17,409
Therefore I

1176
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:19,870
requested Manager Shimazaki

1177
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:23,116
to stop Koreans from being unfairly accused,

1178
01:30:23,209 --> 01:30:26,668
and demanded an open trial!

1179
01:30:30,508 --> 01:30:32,750
- Out of the way.
- Let's go.

1180
01:30:33,803 --> 01:30:35,089
And furthermore,

1181
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:37,592
I reached an agreement with the manager.

1182
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:38,843
First!

1183
01:30:39,059 --> 01:30:42,769
We will be given the same quality
food as the Japanese!

1184
01:30:42,854 --> 01:30:44,061
Second!

1185
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:47,766
The coal quotas raised last month
will be lowered!

1186
01:30:47,859 --> 01:30:48,565
Third!

1187
01:30:48,652 --> 01:30:51,269
Full time off on holidays!

1188
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:52,519
Fourth!

1189
01:30:52,822 --> 01:30:56,736
Work to repair the island
will be compensated!

1190
01:30:57,619 --> 01:31:00,908
And finally! Injured young workers
will all be returned...

1191
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:03,364
to our homeland Korea!

1192
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:06,413
We'll send them home!

1193
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:12,711
There's just one condition!

1194
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:15,214
Given what we will receive,

1195
01:31:15,762 --> 01:31:17,970
we need to show our sincerity.

1196
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:23,009
Tomorrow is Hashima Mine's
first opening since the bombing.

1197
01:31:23,436 --> 01:31:26,850
The manager has asked

1198
01:31:27,065 --> 01:31:29,933
as a show of our unity and for a new start,

1199
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:33,940
that all Koreans including
women and children,

1200
01:31:34,114 --> 01:31:37,983
join the opening ceremony inside the mine.

1201
01:31:38,576 --> 01:31:40,818
What do you all think?

1202
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:42,278
I object!

1203
01:31:43,623 --> 01:31:46,491
Yoon Hak-chul never met the manager today.

1204
01:31:46,793 --> 01:31:48,284
The manager is dead.

1205
01:31:48,461 --> 01:31:50,373
If you enter the mine tomorrow,

1206
01:31:50,547 --> 01:31:53,005
acting manager Yamada will have you buried.

1207
01:31:53,091 --> 01:31:53,672
What?

1208
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:56,341
Park Mu-young, stop trying to stir chaos!

1209
01:31:56,428 --> 01:32:00,263
The U. S. has invaded Okinawa,
and the war is almost over.

1210
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:04,008
Yoon Hak-chul and Yamada
plan to bury you here

1211
01:32:04,144 --> 01:32:06,602
and then escape to the U. S. army.

1212
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:07,724
Friends!

1213
01:32:07,981 --> 01:32:11,474
That man is a spy trying
to divide us Koreans! A spy!

1214
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:13,150
All of you here

1215
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:18,732
are decisive witnesses
of Hashima's war crimes.

1216
01:32:18,867 --> 01:32:20,483
Therefore, this company

1217
01:32:20,744 --> 01:32:24,454
plans to bury you in the mine
to destroy all evidence.

1218
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:26,246
People!

1219
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:27,998
Tell me!

1220
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:29,499
Who do you trust?

1221
01:32:29,586 --> 01:32:31,999
You fucker!

1222
01:32:32,505 --> 01:32:35,464
That old geezer is a real fox.

1223
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:37,291
Listen up, everyone!

1224
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:41,550
Park is an independence fighter
who came to rescue Yoon.

1225
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:45,008
But... if you can believe it,

1226
01:32:45,143 --> 01:32:49,012
Park discovered that
Yoon was Shimazaki's informant.

1227
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:51,939
So Yoon shot him with a gun!

1228
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:54,107
And this here!

1229
01:32:54,194 --> 01:32:56,277
Written by Yoon and the manager,

1230
01:32:56,362 --> 01:33:00,732
lists all of the money
they skimmed off your paychecks.

1231
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:04,614
People who died of accidents,
hunger, sickness, violence!

1232
01:33:04,704 --> 01:33:08,573
People who died trying to escape.
You stole their compensation!

1233
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:09,952
This man Lee Gang-ok!

1234
01:33:10,126 --> 01:33:14,166
To kiss up to the Japanese,
sold his own daughter!

1235
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:16,463
And that spy

1236
01:33:16,674 --> 01:33:20,008
is completely unknown to us,
coming from who knows where!

1237
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:21,211
That's right!

1238
01:33:21,387 --> 01:33:25,848
How do we know Gang-ok
and that newbie aren't spies?

1239
01:33:26,893 --> 01:33:28,429
Calm down!

1240
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,557
All of us need to band together!

1241
01:33:30,647 --> 01:33:33,355
Let's keep our heads and not be fooled!

1242
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:36,934
These unknown guys coming in
and slandering our Mr. Yoon.

1243
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:38,235
I saw it too!

1244
01:33:39,489 --> 01:33:43,278
Put down the gun, now!
Our men are on the way.

1245
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:44,776
I saw it!

1246
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:48,697
<i>I saw you shoot him and Choong-ho too!</i>

1247
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:51,578
Jang-woo, have you been bought off too?

1248
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:54,243
Why betray your own country?

1249
01:33:54,963 --> 01:33:56,955
Do you really have to sell me?

1250
01:33:57,048 --> 01:34:00,086
Stop it, Jang-woo! How could you do it too?

1251
01:34:00,176 --> 01:34:02,213
What if I show you this?

1252
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:07,848
4088 Yoon Hak-chul.

1253
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:11,018
Torn off your shirt by Choong-ho as he died.

1254
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:15,477
Don't be fooled by appearances.

1255
01:34:16,025 --> 01:34:17,732
They're deceiving you.

1256
01:34:17,819 --> 01:34:20,562
I saw it too! He's a bad man!

1257
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:23,272
That girl saw such an awful thing?

1258
01:34:23,366 --> 01:34:25,904
First, let's look at those documents.

1259
01:34:27,871 --> 01:34:29,783
Bleeding the people dry!

1260
01:34:34,544 --> 01:34:37,787
You need to prove what they say isn't true.

1261
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:39,497
Ito Takamichi! Yoon Hak-chul!

1262
01:34:39,591 --> 01:34:41,708
That money you worked for

1263
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:44,176
is dirty Japanese money!

1264
01:34:44,262 --> 01:34:45,423
Guilty of treason.

1265
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:49,427
That money was for Korean independence!

1266
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:50,428
Was that so wrong?

1267
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:52,726
Bleeding the people dry!

1268
01:34:52,812 --> 01:34:53,893
It was for us!

1269
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:56,393
Pretending to lead, and deceiving the people!

1270
01:34:56,482 --> 01:34:57,689
You fools!

1271
01:34:57,775 --> 01:34:58,811
For betraying the nation,

1272
01:34:58,902 --> 01:35:02,111
You think killing me will bring liberation?

1273
01:35:02,113 --> 01:35:03,320
I punish you in the name of Korea!

1274
01:35:03,323 --> 01:35:05,736
After all I've done!

1275
01:35:25,511 --> 01:35:27,673
<i>So what are we going to do?</i>

1276
01:35:27,889 --> 01:35:30,677
No one's ever managed to escape here.

1277
01:35:30,767 --> 01:35:33,100
Think we can all just hold hands and leave?

1278
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:36,679
Yoon has always tipped off the manager.

1279
01:35:36,773 --> 01:35:38,480
That's why they failed.

1280
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:41,525
If we take the coal transport ship
in the harbor,

1281
01:35:41,903 --> 01:35:43,690
- we can succeed.
- Wait a minute.

1282
01:35:44,822 --> 01:35:46,313
Who's gonna drive that big ship?

1283
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:50,026
Hold on, we got a few boatmen here.

1284
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:53,908
I've sailed fishing boats.

1285
01:35:54,082 --> 01:35:57,041
I know the route, so with
5 or 6 men to row...

1286
01:35:57,126 --> 01:35:58,287
Hold on!

1287
01:35:58,461 --> 01:36:00,828
That freight ship is not a fishing boat!

1288
01:36:00,922 --> 01:36:03,756
It's not just that, if we all run for it

1289
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:07,425
won't they start shooting and stabbing us?
What then?

1290
01:36:08,179 --> 01:36:10,045
The guards who come to Hashima

1291
01:36:10,139 --> 01:36:12,802
were all judged unfit for the battlefield.

1292
01:36:12,934 --> 01:36:16,177
And after the bombing, they're still spooked.

1293
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:18,512
There are much more of us.

1294
01:36:18,606 --> 01:36:19,972
And we got military training...

1295
01:36:20,108 --> 01:36:20,973
Instead,

1296
01:36:21,067 --> 01:36:23,980
how about we try negotiating
with the Japanese?

1297
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:25,356
Right!

1298
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:30,199
To be honest,
Japanese are more enlightened than us.

1299
01:36:30,285 --> 01:36:31,571
If we try dialogue...

1300
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:33,490
Dialogue my ass!

1301
01:36:33,705 --> 01:36:37,415
If they were sensible,
would we be living this way?

1302
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:42,086
Remember the Kanto Earthquake?
They spread rumors that

1303
01:36:42,171 --> 01:36:46,165
Koreans poisoned the wells,
and massacred all Koreans!

1304
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:49,218
You say that because you have skills
and lived easy!

1305
01:36:49,304 --> 01:36:51,387
Who says I lived easy?

1306
01:36:51,472 --> 01:36:53,680
You're just trying to divide us, painter!

1307
01:36:53,766 --> 01:36:54,927
Hey!

1308
01:36:55,351 --> 01:36:57,308
Just decide who'd leave or stay!

1309
01:36:57,395 --> 01:36:58,636
This is wasting time!

1310
01:36:58,730 --> 01:36:59,971
He's right!

1311
01:37:00,315 --> 01:37:03,023
Those who want to go, can go.

1312
01:37:03,151 --> 01:37:04,483
Those who will stay, stay.

1313
01:37:04,652 --> 01:37:08,271
You really think they'd kill so many people?

1314
01:37:08,448 --> 01:37:09,734
- Right?
- Yeah!

1315
01:37:09,824 --> 01:37:11,781
Daddy, aren't we going?

1316
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:16,070
Dammit, I'm gonna blow my top!

1317
01:37:16,205 --> 01:37:18,492
You stupid Koreans!

1318
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:21,917
If you made it this far,
shouldn't you try to live?

1319
01:37:22,045 --> 01:37:26,005
Have you all grown so
used to being stepped on?

1320
01:37:26,215 --> 01:37:29,754
This girl and I want to live!

1321
01:37:29,927 --> 01:37:32,419
We'll go ourselves.

1322
01:37:32,513 --> 01:37:35,631
Wait! I'll go too.

1323
01:37:36,017 --> 01:37:38,885
I lost my leg and became a cripple,

1324
01:37:39,103 --> 01:37:42,562
but I won't let them bury me here.

1325
01:37:43,149 --> 01:37:46,688
But Mallyon, what if they really kill us all?

1326
01:37:47,153 --> 01:37:51,113
Even if just one of us survives,
we win. Just one.

1327
01:37:51,491 --> 01:37:55,701
My life was ruined,
but I won't die in their hands.

1328
01:37:55,828 --> 01:37:57,114
Wait!

1329
01:37:59,957 --> 01:38:01,619
I'll go too.

1330
01:38:23,189 --> 01:38:24,430
<i>Are you really staying?</i>

1331
01:38:24,524 --> 01:38:27,187
How can you trust them?
You should think it over.

1332
01:38:27,276 --> 01:38:30,940
Come on, we'll try talking to the Japanese!

1333
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:32,146
- Let's go!
- There's no time,

1334
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:33,613
so we won't try to persuade you.

1335
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:35,653
Are you crazy? What's going on?

1336
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:39,407
You telling them of our plan is only trouble.

1337
01:38:39,497 --> 01:38:40,908
So please understand.

1338
01:38:40,998 --> 01:38:42,284
And besides,

1339
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:45,372
it'd be best if they found you tied up.

1340
01:38:45,461 --> 01:38:49,045
Don't need this! Damn you, Jang-woo!

1341
01:38:50,049 --> 01:38:51,665
Careful, careful...

1342
01:38:55,888 --> 01:38:58,631
Wait, I don't see Choi Chil-sung's gang.

1343
01:38:58,808 --> 01:39:00,720
If they tell the labor attendant...

1344
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:03,678
They said they're going to rescue Choi.

1345
01:39:03,813 --> 01:39:04,849
Huh?

1346
01:39:04,981 --> 01:39:07,064
What'll they do then?

1347
01:39:08,151 --> 01:39:09,358
Let's hurry.

1348
01:39:17,243 --> 01:39:18,279
Boss!

1349
01:39:19,036 --> 01:39:20,277
What are you doing here?

1350
01:39:22,123 --> 01:39:26,493
They say they'll try you,
but let's go before things get worse.

1351
01:39:26,586 --> 01:39:29,750
Think of this as a drill, like in training.

1352
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:33,882
We're going to move in groups.

1353
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:36,460
<i>When we're ready,</i>

1354
01:39:36,554 --> 01:39:41,140
<i>women, the wounded and children
will move first at our sign.</i>

1355
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:43,425
<i>Our final goal</i>

1356
01:39:43,895 --> 01:39:46,854
<i>is to cross the coal belt over the wall,</i>

1357
01:39:47,148 --> 01:39:49,265
<i>board the ship and escape.</i>

1358
01:39:50,776 --> 01:39:53,189
<i>This is dynamite they prepared for the mine.</i>

1359
01:39:53,529 --> 01:39:56,146
<i>Explosives team,
tie them to the lantern batteries.</i>

1360
01:39:56,282 --> 01:39:58,274
<i>It will strengthen the blast.</i>

1361
01:39:58,826 --> 01:40:02,410
<i>The wounded, use tatami mats to make shields.</i>

1362
01:40:02,872 --> 01:40:07,082
<i>Mallyon and the women will
make rope from fundoshi underwear.</i>

1363
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:12,500
<i>Weapons team, take tools and oil
from the tool factory.</i>

1364
01:40:13,841 --> 01:40:18,632
<i>Lee and his band will
gather bottles for bottle bombs.</i>

1365
01:40:50,294 --> 01:40:54,129
Those who can steer the ship,
help me take control.

1366
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:58,880
The rest of you, wait for our signal.

1367
01:41:00,805 --> 01:41:02,592
It's dangerous, don't touch!

1368
01:41:02,682 --> 01:41:06,471
Why do you always yell at me?

1369
01:41:53,816 --> 01:41:55,148
Why are you here?

1370
01:41:56,485 --> 01:41:58,647
If you're ready, I'll bring everyone.

1371
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:07,779
Don't do this, come with us.

1372
01:42:08,247 --> 01:42:12,082
You really think 400 people
can sneak onto a ship?

1373
01:42:12,251 --> 01:42:15,119
With all those wounded people?

1374
01:42:15,212 --> 01:42:17,499
Then do you want to start a war here?

1375
01:42:18,215 --> 01:42:20,707
We'll all die tomorrow anyway.

1376
01:42:22,303 --> 01:42:24,670
If you try to kill Jong-gu, you'll die too!

1377
01:42:42,907 --> 01:42:44,068
Hey.

1378
01:42:44,325 --> 01:42:46,567
Did Park go without finishing them off?

1379
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:48,653
They weren't here before.

1380
01:42:48,829 --> 01:42:50,070
Dammit!

1381
01:42:58,547 --> 01:42:59,253
(Who's there?)

1382
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:00,706
(It's me! Me!)

1383
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:01,711
(Shishido, it's me.)

1384
01:43:01,801 --> 01:43:02,757
(Gang-ok!)

1385
01:43:02,968 --> 01:43:05,426
(Why are you out so late? Go back inside.)

1386
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:10,258
(I can't believe it either.)

1387
01:43:11,394 --> 01:43:13,226
Get over here, quick!

1388
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:18,523
(With the big event tomorrow, )

1389
01:43:18,693 --> 01:43:20,685
(Yamada said to bring the girls
and pour everyone a drink.)

1390
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:22,106
(Since you guys have it hardest, )

1391
01:43:22,196 --> 01:43:23,983
(I brought some girls... you know?)

1392
01:43:24,073 --> 01:43:25,109
(Really?)

1393
01:43:25,408 --> 01:43:26,865
(Where's the alcohol from?)

1394
01:43:26,951 --> 01:43:29,785
(Shimazaki had it stashed away, )

1395
01:43:30,413 --> 01:43:31,995
(and Yamada took it out.)

1396
01:43:32,081 --> 01:43:35,040
(Just one drink for each of you.)

1397
01:43:35,126 --> 01:43:37,960
(If it's just one, better not to have any.)

1398
01:43:38,045 --> 01:43:40,879
(We'll give it a taste.)

1399
01:43:41,298 --> 01:43:43,665
(Come this way.)

1400
01:44:01,402 --> 01:44:03,769
Bro! Quickly!

1401
01:44:39,315 --> 01:44:41,807
Women and the wounded first.

1402
01:44:44,361 --> 01:44:46,899
<i>(Can we really do this?)</i>

1403
01:44:48,157 --> 01:44:49,568
(I don't see any guards.)

1404
01:44:49,658 --> 01:44:53,072
(I spent so much on Korean girls.)

1405
01:44:53,204 --> 01:44:54,615
(If the manager finds out he'll be mad.)

1406
01:44:54,705 --> 01:44:56,788
(Who will know we started the fire?)

1407
01:44:56,874 --> 01:45:00,914
(They'll think the Koreans
kicked over a candle)

1408
01:45:01,003 --> 01:45:03,086
(while they were sleeping.)

1409
01:45:07,718 --> 01:45:10,461
Out of the way!

1410
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:11,840
Go back!

1411
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:15,507
Hey, it's women and the wounded first!

1412
01:45:15,601 --> 01:45:17,058
I'm wounded too!

1413
01:45:17,144 --> 01:45:21,684
And she's a young girl,
shouldn't we board first?

1414
01:45:21,774 --> 01:45:24,687
Bro! Don't you have any shame?

1415
01:45:24,860 --> 01:45:27,477
Take a look at these people!

1416
01:45:31,492 --> 01:45:33,074
Dammit.

1417
01:45:33,452 --> 01:45:36,991
Then at least let Sohee go first.

1418
01:45:37,081 --> 01:45:38,617
No!

1419
01:46:26,714 --> 01:46:28,421
Get up there, kid!

1420
01:46:37,266 --> 01:46:38,848
The sun will be up soon.

1421
01:46:39,727 --> 01:46:43,971
If you see a cripple go,
you can follow, right?

1422
01:46:54,909 --> 01:46:57,993
You'll be fine if you follow me,

1423
01:46:58,078 --> 01:46:59,740
so you come next.

1424
01:47:00,748 --> 01:47:05,709
<i>Doong-ge, Doong-ge, Doong-ge.</i>

1425
01:47:06,170 --> 01:47:10,710
<i>My baby Doong-ge...</i>

1426
01:47:11,175 --> 01:47:15,590
<i>I am afraid of him being caught.</i>

1427
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:20,340
<i>Don't cry, Doong-ge.</i>

1428
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:26,055
<i>Will he ride in on the wind?</i>

1429
01:47:26,565 --> 01:47:31,401
<i>Will he ride in on the clouds?</i>

1430
01:47:31,987 --> 01:47:36,778
<i>Come without a sound.</i>

1431
01:47:37,242 --> 01:47:42,237
<i>Come without a trace.</i>

1432
01:47:42,581 --> 01:47:48,498
<i>We wanted to be together</i>

1433
01:47:49,046 --> 01:47:53,791
<i>We wanted to live as one</i>

1434
01:47:54,259 --> 01:47:59,004
<i>If not in this world,</i>

1435
01:47:59,515 --> 01:48:04,351
<i>I'll meet you in the next world.</i>

1436
01:48:04,853 --> 01:48:09,644
<i>Doong-ge, Doong-ge, Doong-ge.</i>

1437
01:48:10,234 --> 01:48:14,774
<i>My baby Doong-ge...</i>

1438
01:48:15,447 --> 01:48:20,192
<i>I am afraid of him being caught.</i>

1439
01:48:20,703 --> 01:48:25,073
<i>Don't cry, Doong-ge.</i>

1440
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:34,797
(Get to the coal depository!)

1441
01:48:35,009 --> 01:48:37,797
(The Koreans are escaping!)

1442
01:48:44,518 --> 01:48:46,180
They've been spotted.

1443
01:48:48,605 --> 01:48:51,143
I'll join you, so you go first.

1444
01:48:52,067 --> 01:48:54,559
I keep my promises.

1445
01:48:56,447 --> 01:49:00,191
As they board the ship,
we'll watch their backs.

1446
01:49:07,249 --> 01:49:09,366
You guys in the front, move!

1447
01:50:04,014 --> 01:50:07,348
(The Koreans started a fire!)

1448
01:50:08,227 --> 01:50:10,594
(The Koreans are escaping!)

1449
01:50:24,785 --> 01:50:27,027
(Check the back! Quickly!)

1450
01:50:38,632 --> 01:50:40,339
Don't move in the back!

1451
01:51:12,958 --> 01:51:14,699
Snipers! Explosives!

1452
01:51:37,107 --> 01:51:38,393
Hold on!

1453
01:52:20,984 --> 01:52:22,725
(It's a real war!)

1454
01:52:23,153 --> 01:52:25,145
(Kill every last one of them!)

1455
01:52:41,463 --> 01:52:44,126
You rotten bastards!

1456
01:53:01,066 --> 01:53:04,059
Sohee, stay right here!

1457
01:53:10,617 --> 01:53:14,031
(Kill every one of them!)

1458
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:32,303
(Stop shooting! That way!)

1459

Give her some soy noodles with sugar.

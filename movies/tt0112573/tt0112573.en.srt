1
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:43,769
<i>I shall tell you of William Wallace.</i>

2
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,273
<i>Historians from England
will say I am a liar,</i>

3
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:51,360
<i>but history is written by those
who have hanged heroes.</i>

4
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:56,032
<i>The king of Scotland
had died without a son,</i>

5
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,700
<i>and the king of England,</i>

6
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:01,370
<i>a cruel pagan known
as Edward the Longshanks,</i>

7
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,540
<i>claimed the throne of Scotland
for himself.</i>

8
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,543
<i>Scotland's nobles fought him</i>

9
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:11,005
<i>and fought each other over the crown.</i>

10
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:15,176
<i>So Longshanks invited them
to talks of truce,</i>

11
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:18,429
<i>no weapons, one page only.</i>

12
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,686
<i>Among the farmers of that shire
was Malcolm Wallace,</i>

13
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,563
<i>a commoner with his own lands.</i>

14
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,232
<i>He had two sons, John and William.</i>

15
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,492
I told you to stay.

16
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,120
Well, I finished my work.

17
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,288
Where are we going?

18
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,583
MacAndrews'. He was supposed to visit
when the gathering was over.

19
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,794
- Can I come?
- No. Go home, boy.

20
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,253
But I want to go.

21
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,006
Go home, William,
or you'll feel the back of my hand.

22
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,175
Go you home, William.

23
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,283
MacAndrews!

24
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,092
Holy Jesus.

25
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,055
- It's all right!
- William! William!

26
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,268
William! William, it's all right.

27
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,687
It's all right. Easy, lad.

28
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,205
William.

29
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,293
And I say we hit back now!

30
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,171
- We cannot fight them! It's suicide!
- Something's got to be done.

31
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,965
Wallace is right! We fight them!

32
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,760
Every nobleman who had a will to fight
was at that meeting.

33
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,053
We cannot beat an army.

34
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,888
Not with 50 farmers.

35
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,099
We do not have to beat them,
just fight them.

36
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,727
Now, who's with me?

37
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,687
I am, Wallace.

38
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,731
All right, all right.

39
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:16,899
Ready.

40
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,249
Where do you think you're going?

41
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,708
I'm going with you.

42
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,002
You're going with me, are you?

43
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,422
- And what are you going to do?
- I'm gonna help.

44
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,675
And a good help you'd be, too,

45
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:47,680
but I need you to stay here
and look after the place for me

46
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,098
while I'm away.

47
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,768
I can fight.

48
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,732
I know. I know you can fight.

49
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,782
But it's our wits that make us men.

50
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,289
See you tomorrow.

51
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,071
- English.
- Get down.

52
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:51,243
With your father and brother gone,
they'll kill us and burn the farm.

53
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,746
It's up to us, Hamish.

54
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,223
Nah.

55
00:07:58,979 --> 00:07:59,979
Da?

56
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,269
William.

57
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,399
Come here, lad.

58
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,907
Amen.

59
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,701
- Amen.
- Amen.

60
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,440
William.

61
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,903
I'm your uncle. Argyle.

62
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,502
You have the look of your mother.

63
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,598
We'll stay here tonight.

64
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,059
Tomorrow you'll come home with me.

65
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,936
I don't want to leave.

66
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,399
You didn't want your father to die either,
did you?

67
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,026
But it happened.

68
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,574
Did the priest give a poetic benediction?

69
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,951
"The Lord bless thee and keep thee"?

70
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,911
It was in Latin.

71
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,496
You don't speak Latin?

72
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,668
Well, that's something
we shall have to remedy, isn't it?

73
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,758
The Lord bless thee and keep thee.

74
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:07,596
The Lord cause his light
to shine on thee.

75
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,849
The Lord lift up
his countenance upon thee

76
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,934
and give thee peace.

77
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,312
Amen.

78
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,445
Your heart is free.

79
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,491
Have the courage to follow it.

80
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,020
What are they doing?

81
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,315
Saying goodbye in their own way.

82
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,819
Playing outlawed tunes
on outlawed pipes.

83
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:18,166
It was the same for me and your daddy
when our father was killed.

84
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:50,240
First, learn to use this.

85
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:56,163
Then I'll teach you to use this.

86
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,195
<i>Many years later,</i>

87
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:31,239
<i>Edward the Longshanks,
King of England,</i>

88
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,075
<i>supervised the wedding
of his eldest son,</i>

89
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,661
<i>who would succeed him to the throne.</i>

90
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,707
Amen.

91
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,088
<i>As bride for his son,</i>

92
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,592
<i>Longshanks had chosen the daughter
of his rival,</i>

93
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,385
<i>the King of France.</i>

94
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:19,788
<i>It was widely whispered
that for the princess to conceive,</i>

95
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,874
<i>Longshanks would have to do
the honors himself.</i>

96
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,878
<i>That may have been
what he had in mind all along.</i>

97
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:34,928
Scotland. My land.

98
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:41,560
The French will grovel
to anyone with strength,

99
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,729
but how will they believe our strength

100
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,857
when we cannot rule
the whole of our own island?

101
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,412
Where is my son?

102
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,999
Your pardon, milord.
He asked me to come in his stead.

103
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,835
I sent for him, and he sends you.

104
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,671
Shall I leave, milord?

105
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,509
If he wants his queen
to rule when I am gone,

106
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,596
then, by all means, stay and learn how.

107
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,180
Please.

108
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,686
Nobles.

109
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,690
Nobles are the key
to the door of Scotland.

110
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:32,527
Grant our nobles lands in the north,

111
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:36,489
give their nobles
estates here in England,

112
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,867
and make them too greedy
to oppose us.

113
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:42,037
But, sire,
our nobles will be reluctant to uproot.

114
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,497
New lands mean new taxes,

115
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,583
and they're already taxed
for the war in France.

116
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:50,754
Are they?

117
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,943
The trouble with Scotland
is that it's full of Scots.

118
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:23,244
Perhaps the time has come
to reinstitute an old custom.

119
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,956
Grant them "Prima Nocte."

120
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,002
"First night."

121
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:35,006
When any common girl inhabiting
their lands is married,

122
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:41,346
our nobles shall have sexual rights
to her on the night of her wedding.

123
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:47,977
If we can't get them out,
we'll breed them out.

124
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:53,483
That should fetch just the kind of lords
we want to Scotland,

125
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,276
taxes or no taxes.

126
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:59,364
- A most excellent idea, sire.
- Is it?

127
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:08,581
<i>Now in Edinburgh were gathered
the council of Scottish nobles.</i>

128
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:13,086
<i>Among these was Robert,
the 17th Earl of Bruce,</i>

129
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,965
<i>a leading contender for the crown
of Scotland.</i>

130
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:26,599
I hear that Longshanks
has granted Prima Nocte.

131
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,770
Clearly meant to draw more
of his supporters here.

132
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,151
My father believes that we must
lull Longshanks into our confidence

133
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,236
by neither supporting his decree
nor opposing it.

134
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,904
A wise plan.

135
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,157
And how is your father?
We missed him at the council.

136
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:45,034
His affairs in France
keep him long overdue.

137
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,500
But he sends his greetings,

138
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:56,463
and he says that I speak
for all of the Bruces and for Scotland.

139
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,637
It's all over now.

140
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,639
You've dropped your rock.

141
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,099
Test of manhood.

142
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,436
You win.

143
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,815
Call it a test of soldiery, then.

144
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,318
The English won't let us train
with weapons,

145
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,819
so we train with stones.

146
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,740
The test of a soldier is not in his arm.
It's here.

147
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,742
No. It's here.

148
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,958
Hamish?

149
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,140
Here you go, Son.

150
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,224
Show him how.

151
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,559
Come on, Hamish!

152
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,104
You'll never beat Hamish.

153
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,148
Come on there, boy!

154
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,535
My boy!

155
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,746
That's a good throw.

156
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,414
Aye. Aye, it was.

157
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,669
I was wondering if you could do that
when it matters.

158
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,298
As it matters in battle.

159
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,886
Could you crush a man with that throw?

160
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,430
I could crush you like a worm.

161
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,018
- You could?
<i>- Aye.</i>

162
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,062
Well, then, do it.

163
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:42,903
Would you like to see him crush me
like a worm?

164
00:24:42,927 --> 00:24:43,927
<i>Aye.</i>

165
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,737
- Come do it.
- You'll move.

166
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,114
I will not.

167
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,241
Right.

168
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,409
He'll move.

169
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,411
Come on, Hamish.

170
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,455
Come on there, boy!

171
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,257
Well done!

172
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,356
Fine display, young Wallace.

173
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,025
Are you all right?

174
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,068
You look a wee bit shaky.

175
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:33,239
- I should have remembered the rocks.
- Aye, you should have.

176
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,955
Get up, you big heap.

177
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,457
It's good to see you again.

178
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,208
Aye. Welcome home.

179
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,838
- Got my head.
- Well, you should have moved.

180
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,727
William, will you dance with me?

181
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,772
Of course I will.

182
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,925
I've come to claim the right
<i>of Prima Nocte.</i>

183
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,221
As lord of these lands,
I will bless this marriage

184
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:43,351
by taking the bride into my bed
on the first night of her union.

185
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,186
By God, you will not!

186
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:51,025
It is my noble right.

187
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,148
Good evening, sir.

188
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,691
Young Wallace.

189
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:00,112
- Grand soft evening, huh?
- Aye, it's that.

190
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:03,783
I was wondering if I might have a word
with your daughter.

191
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,911
What do you want
to have a word with her about?

192
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:07,912
Well...

193
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:12,667
Murron, would you like to come
and ride with me on this fine evening?

194
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,255
In this? You're out of your mind.

195
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,508
It's good Scottish weather, madam.
The rain is falling straight down.

196
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:22,093
Slightly to the side, like.

197
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,845
- She can't go with you.
- No?

198
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,223
No the now, anyway.

199
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:29,308
- No the now.
- No the now?

200
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,476
We'll see you later.

201
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,603
The weather's just fine.
It's hardly raining.

202
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,022
Did you not hear what I said?

203
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,775
- Murron!
- Murron! Get...

204
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,696
it's you she takes after.

205
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,061
How did you know me after so long?

206
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,521
I didn't.

207
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:19,025
It's just... I saw you staring at me,
and I didn't know who you were.

208
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:21,152
I'm sorry. I suppose I was.

209
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,991
Are you in the habit of riding off
in the rain with strangers?

210
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:30,328
It was the best way to make you leave.

211
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:35,291
If I can ever work up the courage
to ask you again,

212
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,812
I'll send you a written warning first.

213
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:38,878
That wouldn't do you much good.
I can't read.

214
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,921
- Can you not?
- No.

215
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,427
Well, that's something
we shall have to remedy, isn't it?

216
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:49,221
- You're going to teach me to read, then?
- If you like.

217
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,099
<i>- Aye.</i>
- Ln what language?

218
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,353
You're showing off now.

219
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:58,356
- That's right. Are you impressed yet?
- No. Why? Should I be?

220
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:10,201
Do that standing on your head,
and I'll be impressed.

221
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,620
My kilt will fly up, but I'll try it.

222
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,997
God, you certainly didn't learn
any manners on your travels.

223
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,833
The French and the Romans
have far worse manners than I.

224
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:21,128
- You've been to Rome?
- Aye, Argyle took me on a pilgrimage.

225
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,797
What was it like?

226
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,179
What does that mean?

227
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,555
Beautiful.

228
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,560
But I belong here.

229
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,679
Murron? Come in now.

230
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:26,378
Sir, I know it was strange of me
to invite Murron to ride last night,

231
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,421
but I assure you...

232
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,299
MacClannough's daughter
is another matter.

233
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,010
I've come to fetch you to our meeting.

234
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:36,180
- What kind of meeting?
- The secret kind.

235
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:39,099
Your meetings are a waste of time,
Campbell.

236
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:44,230
Your father was a fighter and a patriot.

237
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,151
I know who my father was.

238
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:54,240
I came back home to raise crops
and, God willing, a family.

239
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,744
- If I can live in peace, I will.
- Go on.

240
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,704
You say you want to stay out
of the troubles?

241
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:01,956
<i>Aye.</i>

242
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:04,625
If you can prove it,
you may court my daughter.

243
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:07,169
Until you prove it, my answer's no.

244
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,462
No?

245
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,089
No, Wallace. No.

246
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,925
- Didn't I just prove it?
- No!

247
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:14,760
- No?
- No!

248
00:34:56,803 --> 00:35:00,014
Of course,
running a farm's a lot of work,

249
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,975
but that will all change
when my sons arrive.

250
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,145
So you've got children?

251
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:09,857
Not yet, but I was hoping
that you could help me with that.

252
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:12,568
So you want me to marry you, then?

253
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:15,029
It's a bit sudden, but all right.

254
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,448
Is that what you call a proposal?

255
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,327
I love you. Always have.

256
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,414
I want to marry you.

257
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,136
Is that a yes?

258
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,305
- Aye, that's a yes.
- Lt is?

259
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,433
We best hurry. He'll be waiting.

260
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,602
- Wait.
- Where are you going?

261
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,027
- What's that?
- You'll see.

262
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:57,423
Father.

263
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,479
I will love you my whole life,

264
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,441
you and no other.

265
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,197
And I you,

266
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:25,159
you and no other, forever.

267
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,535
When am I going to see you again?

268
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,037
Tonight?

269
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,206
- I can't.
- Why not?

270
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:00,374
My dad's growing suspicious.

271
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,625
Growing suspicious, is he?

272
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,546
Wouldn't have anything to do with that,
would it?

273
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,321
When? When? When?

274
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,840
- When?
- Tonight.

275
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,051
- Tonight.
- Tonight.

276
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,102
Look lively, Sergeant.

277
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:33,240
Where are you going, lassie?

278
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:34,408
That looks heavy.

279
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,785
- Let me help you with it.
- No. It's fine.

280
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:39,246
I'm not going to steal it.

281
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:44,543
You remind me
of my daughter back home.

282
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,640
Hello, lassie.

283
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,365
No! No!

284
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,620
Keep it quiet, Smythe.

285
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,042
You bitch!

286
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:44,352
Are you all right?

287
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,271
All right? Come on.

288
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:49,983
- Are you all right?
<i>- Aye.</i>

289
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,693
Are you all right?

290
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,621
- Can you ride?
<i>- Aye.</i>

291
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,128
Come back here, you bastard!

292
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:12,422
Raise the alarm!

293
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,840
Help!

294
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,593
Meet me at the grove. Ride!

295
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,970
They're getting away!

296
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,812
Go round back!

297
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:44,704
Get her!

298
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,916
Come on!

299
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,640
You bitch!

300
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:28,206
Murron?

301
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,048
Murron!

302
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,226
All of you know full well

303
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,645
the great pains I've always taken

304
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:56,067
never to be too strict, too rigid
with the application of our laws.

305
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,029
And as a consequence,

306
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:02,282
have we not learned to live together

307
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:04,576
in relative peace and harmony?

308
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:16,046
And this day's lawlessness
is how you repay my leniency!

309
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,807
Well, you leave me with little choice.

310
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:38,151
An assault on the king's soldiers

311
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:42,530
is the same as an assault
on the king himself.

312
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,840
Now,

313
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,510
let this scrapper come to me.

314
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:50,974
Sir!

315
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,734
There.

316
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,691
Corporal.

317
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,069
Some archers on the tower. Now!

318
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,622
Hold still, Father.

319
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,333
You're an idiot, boy!

320
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,210
Father, you all right?

321
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:39,674
MacAulish.

322
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,302
MacAulish!

323
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:47,473
MacAulish! MacAulish!

324
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:52,228
- MacAulish! MacAulish!
- Wallace! Wallace!

325
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,480
Wallace! Wallace!

326
00:53:54,481 --> 00:54:01,028
Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!

327
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,666
What you waiting for, boy?

328
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,753
Here. You can do it. I'll hold him down.

329
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,591
Here. You can do it.

330
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:28,801
I'll hold him down.

331
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,553
Pour it straight in the wound, boy.

332
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:32,722
I know it seems like a waste
of good whiskey.

333
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,140
Indulge me.

334
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,270
Hold him. Hold him.

335
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:42,148
Hold him. Now let him go.

336
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:45,234
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

337
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:51,866
That'll wake you up in the morning, boy.

338
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:53,576
There's somebody coming!

339
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:55,369
Arm yourselves!

340
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:03,210
There's somebody coming.

341
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,505
MacGregors, from the next glen.

342
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,847
We heard about what was happening.

343
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:18,559
We don't want you amadáns thinking
you can have your fun without us.

344
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,977
- That's right.
<i>- Aye.</i>

345
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,104
Go home.

346
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,191
Some of us are in this.

347
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,818
Can't help that now.

348
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:31,530
But you can help yourselves. Go home.

349
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:34,367
We'll have no homes left when
the English garrison from the castle

350
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:37,203
comes through and burns us out.

351
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:39,705
- And they will.
<i>- Aye.</i>

352
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,084
Welcome.

353
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,199
Patrol returning, milord!

354
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,729
So what news?

355
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:59,285
I have dispatched
100 soldiers to Lanark.

356
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:01,662
They will be returning now!

357
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:04,123
Were they dressed like this?

358
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,585
Actually, it was more like 50.

359
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:09,086
Make it quick.

360
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,466
You remember me?

361
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,386
I never did her any harm.
It was my right.

362
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,512
Your right?

363
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:21,307
Well, I'm here to claim the right
of a husband!

364
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:30,357
I am William Wallace,

365
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:35,488
and the rest of you will be spared.

366
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:38,282
Go back to England and tell them there

367
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:42,703
that Scotland's daughters
and her sons are yours no more.

368
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:47,374
Tell them Scotland is free.

369
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:54,715
Burn it.

370
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,231
Good job, milord.

371
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:33,129
Scottish rebels have routed
one of my garrisons

372
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,464
and murdered the noble lord.

373
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,007
I heard.

374
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:39,718
This Wallace is a brigand,
nothing more.

375
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:43,013
And how would you deal
with this brigand?

376
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,515
Like any common thief.

377
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:48,269
Have the local magistrate arrest him
and punish him accordingly.

378
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:52,148
Leave us.

379
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,995
Wallace has already killed
the magistrate

380
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:08,164
and taken control of the town.

381
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:11,959
Stand up.

382
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,753
In the morning,

383
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:19,008
I depart for France
to press our rights there,

384
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:22,386
and I leave you here
to quell this little rebellion.

385
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,096
Understood? Is it?

386
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:30,603
One day, you will be a king,

387
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:34,607
at least try to act like one.

388
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:40,112
Get away from me!

389
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,990
Convene my military council.

390
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:25,824
There!

391
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:29,954
After them.

392
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,482
No point resisting.

393
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:00,442
You're outnumbered and trapped.

394
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,570
Now, where are the rest of you?
Where's Wallace?

395
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,126
Father?

396
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:19,128
Come in. Come in.

397
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:22,006
A rebellion has begun.

398
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,055
Under whom?

399
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:33,225
A commoner named William Wallace.

400
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:46,572
You will embrace this rebellion.

401
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,783
Support it from our lands in the north.

402
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:52,536
I will gain English favor

403
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:57,541
by condemning it and ordering it
opposed from our lands in the south.

404
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:01,420
Sit down. Stay awhile.

405
01:04:08,887 --> 01:04:10,471
This Wallace,

406
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:16,560
he doesn't even have a knighthood,
but he fights with passion,

407
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:18,145
and he inspires.

408
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:21,815
And you wish to charge off
and fight as he did?

409
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:24,818
So would I.

410
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,487
Well, maybe it's time.

411
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:29,448
It is time to survive.

412
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,534
You're the 17th Robert Bruce.

413
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:38,957
The 16 before you passed you land
and title because they didn't charge in.

414
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,879
- Call a meeting of the nobles.
- They do nothing but talk.

415
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,130
Rightly so.

416
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:48,092
They're as rich in English titles
and lands as they are in Scottish.

417
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:49,635
Just as we are.

418
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:52,679
You admire this man,
this William Wallace.

419
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,307
Uncompromising men
are easy to admire.

420
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:58,227
He has courage, so does a dog.

421
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:01,355
But it is exactly
the ability to compromise

422
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:03,357
that makes a man noble.

423
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,692
And understand this,

424
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:08,362
Edward Longshanks
is the most ruthless king

425
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:11,156
ever to sit on the throne of England,

426
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:17,704
and none of us and nothing of Scotland
will remain unless we are as ruthless.

427
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:21,333
Give ear to our nobles.

428
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:26,797
Knowing their minds
is the key to the throne.

429
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:46,108
Wait. Wait. Look.

430
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:49,236
- This is out, and this is left.
- Of course.

431
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:50,612
Carry on.

432
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,114
Carry on!

433
01:07:34,634 --> 01:07:35,968
You know,

434
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:39,221
eventually, Longshanks will send
his whole northern army against us.

435
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:41,557
Heavy cavalry, armored horse.

436
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,976
Shake the very ground.

437
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,770
They'll ride right over us.

438
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:49,398
Uncle Argyle used to talk about it,

439
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:52,859
how no army had ever stood up
to a charge of heavy horse.

440
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:56,488
- So what do we do?
- Hit, run, hide, the Highland way.

441
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:06,248
We'll make spears.

442
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,001
Hundreds of them.

443
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:12,004
Long spears, twice as long as a man.

444
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,047
- That long?
<i>- Aye.</i>

445
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:17,342
Some men are longer than others.

446
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:20,679
Your mother been telling you stories
about me again.

447
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,516
Volunteers coming in!

448
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,895
William Wallace,

449
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:31,481
we've come to fight and to die for you.

450
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:34,359
Stand up, man. I'm not the Pope.

451
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,321
My name is Faudron. My sword is yours.

452
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:38,447
I brought you this.

453
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:40,490
We checked them for arms.

454
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,243
I brought you this.

455
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:46,413
- My wife made it for you.
- Thank you.

456
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,879
Him? That can't be William Wallace.

457
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,089
I'm prettier than this man.

458
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:01,720
All right, Father. I'll ask him.

459
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:10,062
If I risk my neck for you,
will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?

460
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:13,690
Is your father a ghost,
or do you converse with the Almighty?

461
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:16,943
In order to find his equal,
an Irishman is forced to talk to God.

462
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,070
Yes, Father?

463
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:20,238
The Almighty says
don't change the subject,

464
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:21,907
just answer the fucking question.

465
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:22,949
Mind your tongue.

466
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,451
Insane Irish.

467
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:32,292
Smart enough to get a dagger
past your guards, old man.

468
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:35,295
That's my friend, Irishman,

469
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:37,422
and the answer to your question is yes.

470
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:40,425
You fight for me,
you get to kill the English.

471
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,094
Excellent!

472
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:44,304
Stephen is my name.

473
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:49,601
I'm the most wanted man on my island,
except I'm not on my island, of course.

474
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,103
More's the pity.

475
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:53,438
Your island? You mean Ireland?

476
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,023
Yeah. It's mine.

477
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:01,279
You're a madman.

478
01:10:08,496 --> 01:10:11,039
I've come to the right place, then.

479
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:34,664
Sure didn't the Almighty
send me to watch your back?

480
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:38,293
I didn't like him anyway.

481
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:42,672
He wasn't right in the head.

482
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:57,312
William!

483
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,147
It's several runners!

484
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:13,870
The English are advancing
an army toward Stirling.

485
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:15,080
Do the nobles rally?

486
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:18,583
Robert the Bruce and most of the others
will not commit to battle,

487
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,001
but word has spread,

488
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,922
and the Highlanders
are coming down on their own.

489
01:12:21,946 --> 01:12:25,282
Aye, in droves of hundreds
and thousands.

490
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:28,009
Are you ready for a war?

491
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:45,151
- Well, what news?
- We're outnumbered,

492
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:46,444
at least three to one.

493
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:48,989
- How many horse, then?
- Three hundred. Maybe more.

494
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:50,448
Three hundred heavy horse?

495
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:53,910
- We must try to negotiate.
- Well, who is in command?

496
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:57,497
- Did he have a scarlet chevron?
- Aye, he did.

497
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:00,959
We can still negotiate.

498
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:06,756
What are they talking about?

499
01:13:06,757 --> 01:13:09,551
I can't hear, but it doesn't look good.

500
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:11,595
The nobles will negotiate.

501
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:14,014
They'll do a deal, then we go home.

502
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:17,142
If not, we charge.

503
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:20,020
Three hundred heavy horse,
we've no chance.

504
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:21,039
So many.

505
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:28,838
I didn't come here to fight
so they could own more lands.

506
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:31,341
Then I'll have to work for them.

507
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:32,509
Nor me.

508
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:38,014
All right, lads!
I'm not dying for these bastards.

509
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:39,599
Let's go home!

510
01:14:57,451 --> 01:15:00,912
Stop, men! Do not flee!

511
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:03,456
Wait until we've negotiated!

512
01:15:56,927 --> 01:15:58,219
William Wallace.

513
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,305
Can't be. Not tall enough.

514
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,870
The Almighty says
this must be a fashionable fight.

515
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:25,747
It's drawn the finest people.

516
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:27,415
Where is thy salute?

517
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:31,294
For presenting yourselves
on this battlefield, I give you thanks.

518
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:32,921
This is our army.

519
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:34,547
To join it, you give homage.

520
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:37,008
I give homage to Scotland,

521
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:39,844
and if this is your army

522
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:42,597
why does it go?

523
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:45,308
We didn't come here to fight for them!

524
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:51,189
Home! The English are too many.

525
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:01,991
Sons of Scotland,

526
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,953
I am William Wallace.

527
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:07,205
William Wallace is seven feet tall.

528
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:09,249
Yes, I've heard.

529
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:11,626
He kills men by the hundreds,

530
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:14,379
and if he were here,
he'd consume the English

531
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:19,008
with fireballs from his eyes
and bolts of lightning from his arse.

532
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:24,013
I am William Wallace,

533
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:29,686
and I see a whole army
of my countrymen

534
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:32,480
here in defiance of tyranny.

535
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:38,570
You've come to fight as free men.

536
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:42,407
And free men you are.

537
01:17:45,536 --> 01:17:48,037
What will you do with that freedom?

538
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:51,875
Will you fight?

539
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:54,919
No! No! No!

540
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:57,130
Fight? Against that? No!

541
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:59,799
We will run, and we will live.

542
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,177
<i>Aye.</i>

543
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:04,304
Fight, and you may die.

544
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:06,264
Run, and you'll live.

545
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:09,017
At least awhile.

546
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:15,648
And dying in your beds
many years from now,

547
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:22,322
would you be willing to trade
all the days from this day to that

548
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:28,161
for one chance, just one chance,
to come back here and tell our enemies

549
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:30,705
that they may take our lives,

550
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:34,626
but they'll never take our freedom?

551
01:19:01,946 --> 01:19:03,988
They seem quite optimistic to me.

552
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,281
Maybe they do want to fight.

553
01:19:05,282 --> 01:19:08,952
Confrontation might be
a foregone conclusion, milord,

554
01:19:08,953 --> 01:19:12,163
but, nonetheless, I think
we should deliver the king's terms.

555
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:15,500
The king's terms?
He'll never live up to them.

556
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:17,085
Milord, I think...

557
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:19,671
All right. Offer them the terms.

558
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:25,051
They're coming out.
Shall we go and meet them?

559
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:27,387
- Let me do the talking. Agreed?
- Agreed.

560
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:35,853
Fine speech.

561
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:37,605
Now what do we do?

562
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:41,192
Just be yourselves.

563
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:43,486
Where are you going?

564
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:45,530
I'm going to pick a fight.

565
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:55,540
Well, we didn't get dressed up
for nothing.

566
01:19:58,085 --> 01:20:00,128
Mornay, Lochlan, Craig.

567
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:07,385
Here are the king's terms.

568
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:10,555
Lead this army off the field,

569
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:17,812
and he will give you each
estates in Yorkshire,

570
01:20:18,772 --> 01:20:21,190
including hereditary title,

571
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:23,776
from which you will pay...

572
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:25,945
From which you will pay him
an annual duty...

573
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:27,488
I have an offer for you.

574
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:29,991
Cheltham, this is William Wallace.

575
01:20:31,702 --> 01:20:34,120
From which you will pay the king
an annual duty...

576
01:20:34,121 --> 01:20:35,580
I said I have an offer for you.

577
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:37,290
You disrespect a banner of truce?

578
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:39,375
From his king? Absolutely.

579
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:42,628
Here are Scotland's terms.

580
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:46,674
Lower your flags
and march straight back to England,

581
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:49,385
stopping at every home you pass by
to beg forgiveness

582
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:52,263
for 100 years of theft, rape and murder.

583
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:55,767
Do that and your men shall live.

584
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:58,936
Do it not
and every one of you will die today.

585
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:08,071
You are outmatched.

586
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:09,947
You have no heavy cavalry.

587
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:12,408
In two centuries, no army has won...

588
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:14,035
I'm not finished!

589
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,331
Before we let you leave,

590
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:23,795
your commander must cross that field,
present himself before this army,

591
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:25,922
put his head between his legs,

592
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:27,799
and kiss his own arse.

593
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:41,020
I'd say that was rather less cordial
than he was used to.

594
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:43,398
You be ready and do exactly as I say.

595
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:44,524
On my signal,

596
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:47,652
ride round behind our position
and flank them.

597
01:21:47,653 --> 01:21:49,237
We must not divide our forces.

598
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:52,115
Do it and let the English see you do it.

599
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:55,618
They'll think we run away.

600
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:58,496
Take out their archers.
I'll meet you in the middle.

601
01:21:58,497 --> 01:22:00,039
Right. Come on.

602
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:26,441
Insolent bastard.

603
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:29,360
I want this Wallace's heart on a plate.

604
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:30,820
Archers.

605
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:33,489
- Archers! Archers!
- Archers!

606
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:43,166
- Archers, forward!
- Archers, forward!

607
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:40,598
You bastards!

608
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:16,592
Loose!

609
01:24:36,822 --> 01:24:39,490
The Lord tells me he can get me
out of this mess,

610
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:42,034
but he's pretty sure you're fucked.

611
01:25:03,307 --> 01:25:04,849
- Ready!
- Loose!

612
01:25:22,701 --> 01:25:24,243
Ride!

613
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:31,500
See, every Scot with a horse is fleeing.

614
01:25:31,501 --> 01:25:34,629
Our cavalry will ride them down
like grass.

615
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,213
Send the horse.

616
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:37,882
Full attack.

617
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:53,999
Steady!

618
01:26:55,293 --> 01:26:56,293
Hold!

619
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:27,116
Now!

620
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:14,038
Send the infantry.

621
01:28:14,039 --> 01:28:16,081
- Milord...
- You lead them!

622
01:30:35,472 --> 01:30:36,889
Retreat!

623
01:31:11,633 --> 01:31:14,426
Bastard!

624
01:31:56,970 --> 01:31:58,595
All right.

625
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:31,670
- Wallace!
- Wallace!

626
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:56,563
Wallace! Wallace!

627
01:33:10,877 --> 01:33:14,213
I knight thee Sir William Wallace.

628
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:21,095
Sir William, in the name of God,

629
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:24,848
we declare and appoint thee guardian
and high protector of Scotland

630
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:28,060
and thy captains as aides-de-camp.

631
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:30,229
Stand and be recognized.

632
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:44,076
Does anyone know his politics?

633
01:33:44,077 --> 01:33:47,788
No, but his weight with the commoners
could unbalance everything.

634
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:51,375
The Balliols will kiss his arse,
and so we must.

635
01:33:59,008 --> 01:34:00,551
Sir William.

636
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:06,682
Sir William,

637
01:34:06,683 --> 01:34:10,769
inasmuch as you and your captains hail
from a region

638
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:13,730
long known to support the Balliol clan,

639
01:34:13,731 --> 01:34:16,608
may we invite you
to continue your support

640
01:34:16,609 --> 01:34:19,361
and uphold our rightful claim?

641
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:21,405
Damn the Balliol clan!

642
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:23,907
They're all Longshanks' men!

643
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:28,287
Gentlemen. Gentlemen!

644
01:34:28,288 --> 01:34:31,248
- Now is the time to declare a king.
- Wait!

645
01:34:31,249 --> 01:34:34,293
And you're prepared to recognize
our legitimate succession, I take it.

646
01:34:34,294 --> 01:34:36,334
You're the ones who won't
support the rightful king.

647
01:34:36,358 --> 01:34:38,088
Those were lies
when you first wrote them.

648
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:39,756
- No.
- That's the truth.

649
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:42,092
I demand recognition
of these documents!

650
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:45,095
These documents were lies
when you wrote them!

651
01:34:47,223 --> 01:34:49,474
Gentlemen, please! Gentlemen!

652
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:51,101
Please, gentlemen!

653
01:34:51,227 --> 01:34:53,979
Wait! Sir William, where are you going?

654
01:34:56,274 --> 01:35:00,819
We have beaten the English,
but they'll come back

655
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:03,614
because you won't stand together.

656
01:35:03,615 --> 01:35:04,907
What will you do?

657
01:35:04,908 --> 01:35:06,867
I will invade England

658
01:35:06,868 --> 01:35:09,703
and defeat the English
on their own ground.

659
01:35:11,956 --> 01:35:14,208
Invade? That's impossible.

660
01:35:14,209 --> 01:35:15,709
Why?

661
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:17,794
Why is that impossible?

662
01:35:17,795 --> 01:35:22,674
You're so concerned with squabbling
for the scraps from Longshanks' table

663
01:35:22,675 --> 01:35:26,929
that you've missed your God-given right
to something better.

664
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:29,473
There's a difference between us.

665
01:35:29,474 --> 01:35:31,183
You think the people
of this country exist

666
01:35:31,184 --> 01:35:33,977
to provide you with position.

667
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:38,065
I think your position exists
to provide those people with freedom,

668
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:42,110
and I go to make sure that they have it.

669
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:56,500
Wait!

670
01:35:59,921 --> 01:36:01,546
I respect what you said,

671
01:36:01,547 --> 01:36:05,008
but remember that these men
have lands and castles.

672
01:36:05,677 --> 01:36:06,927
It's much to risk.

673
01:36:06,928 --> 01:36:08,888
And the common man that bleeds
on the battlefield,

674
01:36:08,912 --> 01:36:10,663
does he risk less?

675
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,812
No.

676
01:36:17,146 --> 01:36:20,524
But from top to bottom,
this country has got no sense of itself.

677
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:23,777
Its nobles share allegiance
with England.

678
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:25,570
Its clans war with each other.

679
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:27,030
<i>- Aye.
- Aye.</i>

680
01:36:28,366 --> 01:36:31,034
If you make enemies on both sides
of the border,

681
01:36:31,035 --> 01:36:32,536
you'll end up dead.

682
01:36:32,537 --> 01:36:35,247
We all end up dead.
It's just a question of how and why.

683
01:36:35,248 --> 01:36:39,376
I'm not a coward. I want what you want,
but we need the nobles.

684
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:41,169
- We need them?
<i>- Aye.</i>

685
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:42,379
Nobles.

686
01:36:43,548 --> 01:36:46,383
Now, tell me, what does that mean,
to be noble?

687
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:49,136
Your title gives you claim
to the throne of our country,

688
01:36:49,137 --> 01:36:51,722
but men don't follow titles.

689
01:36:51,723 --> 01:36:53,515
They follow courage.

690
01:36:53,516 --> 01:36:55,475
Now, our people know you.

691
01:36:55,476 --> 01:36:57,185
Noble and common, they respect you,

692
01:36:57,186 --> 01:37:00,814
and if you would
just lead them to freedom,

693
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:04,901
they'd follow you.

694
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:08,613
And so would I.

695
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:32,095
Damn it!

696
01:37:32,096 --> 01:37:35,098
My sodomite cousin the prince
tells me he has no troops to lend,

697
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:38,643
and every town in northern England
is begging for help.

698
01:37:40,188 --> 01:37:41,813
- He advances!
- To which town?

699
01:37:41,814 --> 01:37:43,607
To here, milord.

700
01:37:44,275 --> 01:37:45,942
Bring the food and provisions inside.

701
01:37:45,943 --> 01:37:48,445
Double the wall guards, seal the gate.
Now!

702
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:52,157
Bring in the provisions!

703
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:24,189
Sir, we can get you out if you leave now.

704
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:25,774
I'm not about to tell my uncle

705
01:38:25,775 --> 01:38:29,111
I've lost him the greatest city
in northern England.

706
01:39:09,152 --> 01:39:10,444
Come on!

707
01:39:45,521 --> 01:39:47,397
Make way for the king!

708
01:39:56,574 --> 01:39:58,408
It's not your fault.

709
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:00,619
Stand up to him!

710
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:03,288
I will stand up to him and more.

711
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:42,994
What news of the north?

712
01:40:44,747 --> 01:40:46,331
Nothing new, Your Majesty.

713
01:40:46,332 --> 01:40:48,750
We've sent riders to speed any word.

714
01:40:48,751 --> 01:40:50,627
I heard the word in France,

715
01:40:50,628 --> 01:40:54,005
where I was fighting
to expand your future kingdom.

716
01:40:54,632 --> 01:40:55,966
The word, my son,

717
01:40:55,967 --> 01:41:00,136
is that our entire
northern army is annihilated,

718
01:41:01,556 --> 01:41:03,932
and you have done nothing.

719
01:41:05,017 --> 01:41:06,768
I have ordered conscriptions, sir.

720
01:41:06,769 --> 01:41:09,646
They're assembled and ready to depart.

721
01:41:11,107 --> 01:41:14,484
Excuse me, sire, but there's
a very urgent message from York.

722
01:41:14,485 --> 01:41:15,986
Come.

723
01:41:24,287 --> 01:41:26,413
- Leave us.
- Thank you, sire.

724
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:32,335
- Wallace has sacked York.
- What?

725
01:41:32,628 --> 01:41:34,629
Wallace has sacked York!

726
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:52,856
Sire, thy own nephew.

727
01:41:54,317 --> 01:41:56,735
What beast could do such a thing?

728
01:41:58,446 --> 01:42:00,363
If he can sack York,

729
01:42:03,159 --> 01:42:05,201
he can invade lower England.

730
01:42:05,202 --> 01:42:07,037
We would stop him!

731
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:14,127
Who is this person who speaks to me
as though I needed his advice?

732
01:42:16,213 --> 01:42:18,715
I have declared Phillip
my high counselor.

733
01:42:18,716 --> 01:42:20,300
Is he qualified?

734
01:42:20,301 --> 01:42:24,596
I am skilled in the arts of war
and military tactics, sire.

735
01:42:25,431 --> 01:42:26,723
Are you?

736
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:31,686
Then tell me,
what advice would you offer

737
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:34,939
on the present situation?

738
01:43:05,888 --> 01:43:07,931
I shall offer a truce

739
01:43:09,475 --> 01:43:11,434
and buy him off.

740
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:16,606
But who will go to him? Not I.

741
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:23,238
If I fell under the sword of that murderer,
it might be my head in a basket.

742
01:43:24,407 --> 01:43:27,784
And not my gentle son.

743
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:29,494
The mere sight of him

744
01:43:29,495 --> 01:43:33,373
would only encourage an enemy
to take over the whole country.

745
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:38,712
So whom do I send?

746
01:43:43,134 --> 01:43:44,467
Whom do I send?

747
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:09,219
I'm dreaming.

748
01:45:09,804 --> 01:45:11,346
Yes, you are.

749
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:14,891
And you must wake.

750
01:45:23,651 --> 01:45:25,527
I don't want to wake.

751
01:45:27,404 --> 01:45:29,697
I want to stay here with you.

752
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:32,700
And I with you,

753
01:45:33,410 --> 01:45:35,328
but you must wake now.

754
01:45:38,666 --> 01:45:40,583
Wake up, William.

755
01:45:40,918 --> 01:45:42,293
Wake up.

756
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:46,548
<i>William, wake up, wake up.</i>

757
01:45:47,174 --> 01:45:48,424
William!

758
01:45:48,425 --> 01:45:52,178
A royal entourage comes,
flying banners of truce

759
01:45:52,179 --> 01:45:54,931
and the standards
of Longshanks himself!

760
01:46:38,893 --> 01:46:41,019
I am the Princess of Wales.

761
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:44,022
I come as the king's servant
and with his authority.

762
01:46:45,024 --> 01:46:46,524
To do what?

763
01:46:47,526 --> 01:46:49,861
To discuss the king's proposals.

764
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:53,990
Will you speak with a woman?

765
01:47:14,345 --> 01:47:17,472
I understand you have recently
been given the rank of knight.

766
01:47:17,473 --> 01:47:19,682
I have been given nothing.

767
01:47:20,059 --> 01:47:22,268
God makes men what they are.

768
01:47:22,811 --> 01:47:25,688
Did God make you the sacker
of peaceful cities,

769
01:47:25,689 --> 01:47:29,484
the executioner of the king's nephew,
my husband's own cousin?

770
01:47:30,444 --> 01:47:34,489
York was the staging point
for every invasion of my country,

771
01:47:35,366 --> 01:47:37,367
and that royal cousin
hanged innocent Scots,

772
01:47:37,368 --> 01:47:40,370
even women and children,
from the city walls.

773
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:47,627
Longshanks did far worse
the last time he took a Scottish city.

774
01:48:07,523 --> 01:48:09,857
You ask your king to his face.

775
01:48:09,858 --> 01:48:11,109
Ask him.

776
01:48:13,737 --> 01:48:17,031
You see if his eyes can convince you
of the truth.

777
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:26,916
Hamilton, leave us.

778
01:48:29,086 --> 01:48:31,546
- Milady...
- Leave us. Now.

779
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:45,393
Let us talk plainly.

780
01:48:45,394 --> 01:48:47,812
You invade England,

781
01:48:47,813 --> 01:48:51,899
but you cannot complete the conquest
so far from your shelter and supply.

782
01:48:53,444 --> 01:48:55,445
The king desires peace.

783
01:48:56,363 --> 01:48:58,072
Longshanks desires peace?

784
01:48:58,073 --> 01:49:00,616
He declares it to me. I swear it.

785
01:49:00,617 --> 01:49:02,994
He proposes that
you withdraw your attack.

786
01:49:02,995 --> 01:49:06,122
In return, he grants you title, estates,

787
01:49:06,123 --> 01:49:10,293
and this chest of gold,
which I am to pay to you personally.

788
01:49:10,294 --> 01:49:12,336
A lordship and titles.

789
01:49:12,337 --> 01:49:13,421
Gold.

790
01:49:13,422 --> 01:49:15,173
That I should become Judas?

791
01:49:15,174 --> 01:49:16,799
Peace is made in such ways.

792
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:19,093
Slaves are made in such ways!

793
01:49:21,847 --> 01:49:25,641
The last time Longshanks spoke
of peace, I was a boy,

794
01:49:25,642 --> 01:49:28,102
and many Scottish nobles,
who would not be slaves,

795
01:49:28,103 --> 01:49:30,271
were lured by him, under a flag of truce,

796
01:49:30,272 --> 01:49:33,483
to a barn where he had them hanged.

797
01:49:35,152 --> 01:49:36,819
I was very young,

798
01:49:37,488 --> 01:49:40,364
but I remember Longshanks' notion
of peace.

799
01:49:44,161 --> 01:49:46,913
I understand you have suffered.

800
01:49:47,873 --> 01:49:50,374
I know about your woman.

801
01:50:01,887 --> 01:50:03,888
She was my wife.

802
01:50:06,391 --> 01:50:07,558
We married in secret

803
01:50:07,559 --> 01:50:10,895
because I would not share her
with an English lord.

804
01:50:12,022 --> 01:50:14,899
They killed her to get to me.

805
01:50:20,364 --> 01:50:22,490
I have never spoken of it.

806
01:50:24,118 --> 01:50:27,036
I don't know why I tell you now,

807
01:50:30,082 --> 01:50:32,375
except I see her strength in you.

808
01:50:38,215 --> 01:50:40,466
One day, you'll be a queen,

809
01:50:42,845 --> 01:50:45,012
and you must open your eyes.

810
01:50:52,312 --> 01:50:57,316
You tell your king that William Wallace
will not be ruled,

811
01:50:58,068 --> 01:51:00,570
and nor will any Scot while I live.

812
01:51:34,021 --> 01:51:38,691
My son's loyal wife returns unkilled
by the heathen.

813
01:51:38,692 --> 01:51:40,193
So he accepted our bribe?

814
01:51:40,194 --> 01:51:41,777
No, he did not.

815
01:51:43,614 --> 01:51:45,573
Then why does he stay?

816
01:51:45,574 --> 01:51:48,826
My scouts tell me
that he has not advanced.

817
01:51:48,827 --> 01:51:50,995
He waits for you at York.

818
01:51:50,996 --> 01:51:53,831
He says he will attack
no more towns or cities

819
01:51:53,832 --> 01:51:56,626
if you are man enough
to come and face him.

820
01:51:56,627 --> 01:51:57,919
Did he?

821
01:51:59,004 --> 01:52:02,924
The Welsh bowmen will not be detected

822
01:52:02,925 --> 01:52:07,011
arriving so far around his flank.

823
01:52:07,638 --> 01:52:11,807
The main force of our armies
from France will land here

824
01:52:11,808 --> 01:52:13,893
to the north of Edinburgh.

825
01:52:13,894 --> 01:52:19,774
Conscripts from Ireland will approach
from the southwest to here.

826
01:52:19,775 --> 01:52:23,569
Welsh bowmen? Troops from France?
Irish conscripts?

827
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:26,989
Even if you dispatch them today,
they'd take weeks to assemble.

828
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:30,618
I dispatched them
before I sent your wife.

829
01:52:35,374 --> 01:52:37,875
So our little ruse succeeded.

830
01:52:37,876 --> 01:52:40,002
Thank you.

831
01:52:40,003 --> 01:52:43,881
And while this upstart awaits
my arrival in York,

832
01:52:43,882 --> 01:52:47,677
my forces will have arrived
in Edinburgh behind him.

833
01:52:49,012 --> 01:52:55,434
You spoke with this Wallace in private.

834
01:52:56,395 --> 01:52:57,853
Tell me,

835
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:01,565
what kind of man is he?

836
01:53:02,943 --> 01:53:04,860
A mindless barbarian.

837
01:53:06,113 --> 01:53:08,281
Not a king like you, milord.

838
01:53:10,534 --> 01:53:12,952
You may return to your embroidery.

839
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:15,621
Humbly, milord.

840
01:53:15,622 --> 01:53:18,291
You brought back the money, of course.

841
01:53:21,753 --> 01:53:26,465
No. I gave it to ease the suffering
of the children of this war.

842
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:31,637
That's what happens
when you send a woman.

843
01:53:33,515 --> 01:53:35,266
Forgive me, sire.

844
01:53:35,267 --> 01:53:39,395
I thought that generosity
might demonstrate your greatness

845
01:53:39,396 --> 01:53:41,731
to those you mean to rule.

846
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:47,862
My greatness will be
better demonstrated

847
01:53:47,863 --> 01:53:53,242
when Wallace returns to Scotland
and finds his country in ashes.

848
01:53:58,040 --> 01:53:59,540
William!

849
01:53:59,541 --> 01:54:01,542
There's riders approaching!

850
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:11,886
Personal escort of the princess.

851
01:54:11,887 --> 01:54:13,387
<i>Aye.</i>

852
01:54:14,181 --> 01:54:16,432
Must have made an impression.

853
01:54:17,267 --> 01:54:18,434
<i>Aye.</i>

854
01:54:18,435 --> 01:54:21,437
I didn't think you were
in the tent that long.

855
01:54:25,108 --> 01:54:26,609
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

856
01:54:56,723 --> 01:54:59,683
It's true! English ships are moving
up from the south!

857
01:54:59,684 --> 01:55:02,853
I don't know about the Welsh yet,
but the Irish have landed!

858
01:55:02,854 --> 01:55:05,981
I had to see it with me own eyes
before I could believe it.

859
01:55:05,982 --> 01:55:08,401
What the hell are the Irish doing
fighting with the English?

860
01:55:08,402 --> 01:55:10,152
I wouldn't worry about them.

861
01:55:10,153 --> 01:55:14,365
Didn't I tell you before? It's my island.

862
01:55:14,366 --> 01:55:18,035
Hamish, ride ahead to Edinburgh
and assemble the council.

863
01:55:18,036 --> 01:55:19,745
- Order it.
<i>- Aye.</i>

864
01:55:24,334 --> 01:55:27,294
- Your island?
- My island! Yup!

865
01:55:28,672 --> 01:55:30,131
You want to negotiate?

866
01:55:30,132 --> 01:55:31,549
No, please, gentlemen!

867
01:55:31,550 --> 01:55:34,009
Lords, Craig is right!

868
01:55:34,010 --> 01:55:37,263
This time,
our only option is to negotiate.

869
01:55:37,264 --> 01:55:40,766
Now, unless you want to see Edinburgh
razed to the ground...

870
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:50,651
My army has marched for more days
than I can remember

871
01:55:50,652 --> 01:55:52,528
and we still have preparations to make,

872
01:55:52,529 --> 01:55:54,697
so I'll make this plain.

873
01:55:55,949 --> 01:55:58,451
We require every soldier
you can summon.

874
01:55:58,452 --> 01:56:01,370
Your personal escorts, even yourselves,

875
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:03,622
and we need them now.

876
01:56:05,167 --> 01:56:08,627
With such a force arrayed against us,
it's time to discuss other options.

877
01:56:08,628 --> 01:56:10,212
Other options?

878
01:56:11,715 --> 01:56:15,718
Don't you wish at least
to lead your men onto the field

879
01:56:15,719 --> 01:56:18,179
and barter a better deal
with Longshanks

880
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:20,055
before you tuck tail and run?

881
01:56:20,056 --> 01:56:22,016
- Sir William...
- We can't defeat this army!

882
01:56:22,017 --> 01:56:23,809
- We can! And we will!
- Sir William!

883
01:56:27,272 --> 01:56:30,107
We won at Stirling,
and still you quibble!

884
01:56:31,985 --> 01:56:34,820
We won at York,
and you would not support us.

885
01:56:35,363 --> 01:56:39,283
If you'll not stand up with us now,
then I say you're cowards.

886
01:56:44,915 --> 01:56:48,751
And if you are Scotsmen,
I'm ashamed to call myself one.

887
01:56:49,503 --> 01:56:52,296
Please, Sir William,
speak with me alone.

888
01:56:54,508 --> 01:56:55,966
I beg you.

889
01:56:59,346 --> 01:57:02,097
Now, you've achieved more
than anyone ever dreamed,

890
01:57:02,098 --> 01:57:05,935
but fighting these odds,
it looks like rage, not courage.

891
01:57:05,936 --> 01:57:07,895
It's well beyond rage.

892
01:57:09,856 --> 01:57:11,440
Help me.

893
01:57:13,068 --> 01:57:16,320
In the name of Christ, help yourselves!

894
01:57:16,321 --> 01:57:18,280
Now is our chance. Now.

895
01:57:18,990 --> 01:57:20,533
If we join, we can win.

896
01:57:20,534 --> 01:57:24,662
If we win, well, then we'll have
what none of us have ever had before.

897
01:57:25,622 --> 01:57:27,122
A country of our own.

898
01:57:29,376 --> 01:57:31,585
You're the rightful leader,

899
01:57:31,586 --> 01:57:33,629
and there is strength in you. I see it.

900
01:57:39,135 --> 01:57:40,469
Unite us.

901
01:57:43,974 --> 01:57:45,224
Unite us!

902
01:57:45,225 --> 01:57:47,101
Unite the clans.

903
01:57:53,483 --> 01:57:54,942
All right.

904
01:57:54,943 --> 01:57:56,443
Right.

905
01:58:01,616 --> 01:58:03,534
This cannot be the way.

906
01:58:04,244 --> 01:58:08,664
You said yourself,
the nobles will not support Wallace.

907
01:58:10,333 --> 01:58:14,503
So how does it help us
to join the side that is slaughtered?

908
01:58:15,338 --> 01:58:17,339
I gave him my word.

909
01:58:25,724 --> 01:58:27,516
I know it is hard.

910
01:58:28,351 --> 01:58:30,019
Being a leader is.

911
01:58:31,313 --> 01:58:32,646
Now, Son...

912
01:58:33,815 --> 01:58:36,483
Son, look at me.

913
01:58:44,159 --> 01:58:45,868
I cannot be king.

914
01:58:46,745 --> 01:58:49,830
You and you alone can rule Scotland.

915
01:58:50,373 --> 01:58:53,083
What I tell you, you must do.

916
01:58:53,084 --> 01:58:55,836
Not for me, not for yourself,

917
01:58:55,837 --> 01:58:57,838
for your country.

918
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:15,314
Lads, make way.

919
01:59:15,565 --> 01:59:16,565
Coming through you.

920
01:59:23,490 --> 01:59:25,324
Make way, lads.

921
01:59:25,325 --> 01:59:26,825
Make...

922
01:59:30,538 --> 01:59:33,123
The Bruce is not coming, William.

923
01:59:33,750 --> 01:59:35,584
He'll come.

924
01:59:36,586 --> 01:59:39,046
Mornay and Lochlan have come,

925
01:59:40,757 --> 01:59:42,508
so will the Bruce.

926
01:59:45,595 --> 01:59:49,264
Quite a lovely gathering.

927
01:59:50,350 --> 01:59:52,184
Wouldn't you agree?

928
01:59:55,730 --> 01:59:57,231
The archers are ready, sire.

929
01:59:57,232 --> 01:59:58,941
Not the archers.

930
01:59:58,942 --> 02:00:01,068
My scouts tell me
their archers are miles away

931
02:00:01,069 --> 02:00:02,528
and no threat to us.

932
02:00:02,529 --> 02:00:06,990
Arrows cost money. Use up the Irish.
The dead cost nothing.

933
02:00:06,991 --> 02:00:10,202
And send in the infantry and cavalry.

934
02:00:10,203 --> 02:00:11,620
Infantry!

935
02:00:11,996 --> 02:00:13,455
- Infantry!
- Infantry!

936
02:00:13,456 --> 02:00:14,748
Cavalry!

937
02:00:14,749 --> 02:00:18,001
- Cavalry!
- Cavalry!

938
02:00:18,628 --> 02:00:19,837
Advance!

939
02:00:20,088 --> 02:00:22,256
- Advance!
- Advance!

940
02:01:46,382 --> 02:01:49,551
- Good to see you this morning!
- Hi. How are you?

941
02:01:51,387 --> 02:01:53,388
Irish.

942
02:01:53,389 --> 02:01:54,723
Glad to have you with us.

943
02:01:54,724 --> 02:01:56,141
Watch this.

944
02:04:06,981 --> 02:04:09,191
Mornay? Lochlan?

945
02:04:09,192 --> 02:04:11,985
I gave Mornay double his lands
in Scotland

946
02:04:11,986 --> 02:04:14,279
with matching estates in England.

947
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:17,699
Lochlan turned for much less.

948
02:04:18,493 --> 02:04:19,826
Archers.

949
02:04:19,827 --> 02:04:21,328
I beg pardon, sire.

950
02:04:21,329 --> 02:04:23,538
Won't we hit our own troops?

951
02:04:25,416 --> 02:04:27,125
Yes,

952
02:04:27,126 --> 02:04:29,252
but we'll hit theirs as well.

953
02:04:29,253 --> 02:04:30,921
We have reserves.

954
02:04:32,256 --> 02:04:33,840
Attack.

955
02:04:35,051 --> 02:04:36,218
Archers!

956
02:04:37,220 --> 02:04:39,221
- Archers.
- Archers.

957
02:04:43,977 --> 02:04:44,977
Loose!

958
02:05:14,132 --> 02:05:16,550
Send in our reinforcements.

959
02:05:16,884 --> 02:05:18,552
Send in the rest!

960
02:05:29,022 --> 02:05:30,731
Bring me Wallace.

961
02:05:31,566 --> 02:05:32,858
Alive, if possible.

962
02:05:32,859 --> 02:05:35,110
Dead, just as good.

963
02:05:36,279 --> 02:05:38,488
Send us news of our victory.

964
02:05:38,489 --> 02:05:40,532
Shall we retire?

965
02:07:05,159 --> 02:07:06,827
Protect the king.

966
02:09:10,534 --> 02:09:14,162
Get up!

967
02:09:15,665 --> 02:09:16,998
Up!

968
02:09:16,999 --> 02:09:18,333
Get up!

969
02:09:18,834 --> 02:09:20,710
- Get him out of here!
- Jesus!

970
02:09:25,883 --> 02:09:27,550
Go!

971
02:10:27,611 --> 02:10:29,070
I'm dying.

972
02:10:32,825 --> 02:10:34,242
Let me be.

973
02:10:40,124 --> 02:10:41,249
No.

974
02:10:42,626 --> 02:10:44,586
You're going to live.

975
02:10:46,339 --> 02:10:49,382
I've lived long enough to live free.

976
02:10:49,925 --> 02:10:54,137
Proud to see you become
the man you are.

977
02:10:59,643 --> 02:11:01,770
I'm a happy man.

978
02:12:50,754 --> 02:12:53,923
I'm the one who's rotting,

979
02:12:53,924 --> 02:12:57,802
but I think your face looks graver
than mine.

980
02:13:02,057 --> 02:13:03,600
Son,

981
02:13:09,648 --> 02:13:13,276
we must have alliance with England
to prevail here.

982
02:13:14,195 --> 02:13:16,279
You achieved that.

983
02:13:16,280 --> 02:13:20,074
You saved your family,
increased your land.

984
02:13:20,826 --> 02:13:24,787
In time, you will have
all the power in Scotland.

985
02:13:25,664 --> 02:13:31,252
Lands, titles, men, power, nothing.

986
02:13:31,921 --> 02:13:34,631
- Nothing?
- I have nothing.

987
02:13:35,966 --> 02:13:37,425
Men fight for me

988
02:13:38,052 --> 02:13:40,512
because if they do not,
I throw them off my land

989
02:13:40,513 --> 02:13:43,806
and I starve their wives
and their children.

990
02:13:43,807 --> 02:13:48,978
Those men who bled the ground red
at Falkirk,

991
02:13:50,481 --> 02:13:51,761
they fought for William Wallace,

992
02:13:51,785 --> 02:13:55,579
and he fights for something
that I've never had.

993
02:13:58,447 --> 02:14:00,907
And I took it from him
when I betrayed him,

994
02:14:00,908 --> 02:14:04,452
and I saw it in his face
on the battlefield,

995
02:14:04,453 --> 02:14:06,538
and it's tearing me apart!

996
02:14:07,373 --> 02:14:10,416
All men betray, all lose heart.

997
02:14:10,417 --> 02:14:13,211
I don't want to lose heart!

998
02:14:17,216 --> 02:14:20,760
I want to believe, as he does.

999
02:14:27,810 --> 02:14:30,645
I will never be on the wrong side again.

1000
02:15:20,321 --> 02:15:22,322
No, please!

1001
02:15:48,057 --> 02:15:49,724
There he is! After him!

1002
02:16:19,046 --> 02:16:22,340
Lord Craig, is it true about Mornay?

1003
02:16:22,341 --> 02:16:23,466
<i>Aye.</i>

1004
02:16:24,760 --> 02:16:27,553
Wallace rode into his bedchamber
and killed him.

1005
02:16:27,554 --> 02:16:30,598
More a liability now than ever he was.

1006
02:16:30,599 --> 02:16:33,434
And there's no telling who'll be next.

1007
02:16:35,479 --> 02:16:37,105
Maybe you.

1008
02:16:39,233 --> 02:16:40,817
Maybe me.

1009
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:48,116
It doesn't matter.

1010
02:16:49,910 --> 02:16:52,912
- I'm serious, Robert.
- So am I!

1011
02:17:06,135 --> 02:17:08,386
Christ! Shit!

1012
02:17:08,387 --> 02:17:11,139
Search the place!

1013
02:17:13,475 --> 02:17:14,642
Lochlan.

1014
02:17:21,316 --> 02:17:24,152
William Wallace killed 50 men.

1015
02:17:24,903 --> 02:17:26,904
Fifty if it was one.

1016
02:17:26,905 --> 02:17:30,324
A hundred men with his own sword.

1017
02:17:30,325 --> 02:17:31,909
Cut through them like...

1018
02:17:31,910 --> 02:17:35,163
Moses through the Red Sea.

1019
02:18:07,237 --> 02:18:11,365
His legend grows.
It will be worse than before.

1020
02:18:11,366 --> 02:18:14,619
He rallies new volunteers
in every Scottish town,

1021
02:18:15,788 --> 02:18:17,308
and when he replenishes his numbers...

1022
02:18:17,332 --> 02:18:19,959
They're sheep, mere sheep!

1023
02:18:22,294 --> 02:18:25,421
Easily dispersed
if we strike the shepherd.

1024
02:18:25,881 --> 02:18:27,340
Very well.

1025
02:18:28,217 --> 02:18:32,804
Pick a flock of your finest assassins
and set a meeting.

1026
02:18:32,805 --> 02:18:36,808
Milord, Wallace is renowned
for his ability to smell an ambush.

1027
02:18:40,562 --> 02:18:44,398
If what Lord Hamilton tells me
is correct,

1028
02:18:44,733 --> 02:18:48,277
he warmed to our future queen
and would trust her.

1029
02:18:49,947 --> 02:18:53,699
So we'll dispatch her with the notion
that she comes in peace.

1030
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:56,619
Milord,
the princess might be taken hostage

1031
02:18:56,620 --> 02:18:58,746
or her life be put in jeopardy.

1032
02:18:58,747 --> 02:19:02,375
My son would be
most distressed by that.

1033
02:19:03,418 --> 02:19:06,546
But in truth, if she were to be killed,

1034
02:19:07,172 --> 02:19:11,926
we would soon find the king of France
a useful ally against the Scots.

1035
02:19:14,429 --> 02:19:17,890
You see, as king,

1036
02:19:17,891 --> 02:19:21,060
you must find the good in any situation.

1037
02:19:48,005 --> 02:19:50,423
It's William Wallace, sure.

1038
02:19:51,216 --> 02:19:54,135
He's given up his sword.

1039
02:19:54,136 --> 02:19:55,761
Be ready.

1040
02:21:34,695 --> 02:21:36,195
Milady,

1041
02:21:40,075 --> 02:21:42,159
I received your message.

1042
02:21:54,881 --> 02:21:59,135
This is the second time
you have warned me of danger.

1043
02:22:01,430 --> 02:22:02,847
Why?

1044
02:22:03,515 --> 02:22:05,141
There will be a new shipment
of supplies

1045
02:22:05,142 --> 02:22:08,269
coming north next month.
Foods and weapons. They won't...

1046
02:22:08,937 --> 02:22:10,271
No, stop.

1047
02:22:12,607 --> 02:22:20,607
Why do you help me?

1048
02:22:23,910 --> 02:22:27,121
Because of the way
you are looking at me now.

1049
02:24:19,317 --> 02:24:24,864
Just when we thought all hope was lost,
our noble saviors have arrived.

1050
02:24:27,576 --> 02:24:30,077
Off with their hoods.

1051
02:24:34,249 --> 02:24:37,001
Sir William,
we've come to seek a meeting.

1052
02:24:37,586 --> 02:24:40,296
Well, what's the point?

1053
02:24:40,297 --> 02:24:42,715
You've all sworn loyalty to Longshanks.

1054
02:24:42,716 --> 02:24:45,134
An oath to a liar is no oath at all.

1055
02:24:45,135 --> 02:24:47,845
Every man of us is ready
to swear loyalty to you.

1056
02:24:47,846 --> 02:24:50,389
So let the council swear publicly.

1057
02:24:50,390 --> 02:24:53,851
We cannot.
Some scarcely believe you're alive.

1058
02:24:53,852 --> 02:24:56,979
Others think you'll pay them
Mornay's wages.

1059
02:24:56,980 --> 02:24:58,772
So we bid you to Edinburgh.

1060
02:24:58,773 --> 02:24:59,857
Meet us two days from now.

1061
02:24:59,858 --> 02:25:02,526
Pledge us your pardon,
and we'll unite behind you.

1062
02:25:02,527 --> 02:25:03,777
Scotland will be one.

1063
02:25:03,778 --> 02:25:07,573
- One? You mean us and you.
- No.

1064
02:25:09,284 --> 02:25:11,118
I mean this.

1065
02:25:13,121 --> 02:25:15,706
It's the pledge of Robert the Bruce.

1066
02:25:25,133 --> 02:25:27,676
You do know it's a trap. Tell him.

1067
02:25:27,802 --> 02:25:31,513
I think if the Bruce wanted to kill you,
he'd have done it already at Falkirk.

1068
02:25:31,514 --> 02:25:34,308
<i>- Aye.</i>
- I know. I saw.

1069
02:25:34,309 --> 02:25:37,061
Leaving him aside,
what about the others?

1070
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:39,521
Nest of scheming bastards!

1071
02:25:39,522 --> 02:25:41,565
They couldn't even agree
on the color of shite!

1072
02:25:41,566 --> 02:25:43,025
It's a trap. Are you blind?

1073
02:25:43,026 --> 02:25:44,401
Look at us.

1074
02:25:45,904 --> 02:25:49,323
We've got to try. We can't do this alone.

1075
02:25:50,158 --> 02:25:52,826
Joining the nobles is the only hope
for our people.

1076
02:25:52,827 --> 02:25:54,827
You know what happens
if we don't take that chance?

1077
02:25:54,851 --> 02:25:55,976
What?

1078
02:25:56,164 --> 02:25:57,456
Nothing.

1079
02:25:59,292 --> 02:26:01,418
I don't want to be a martyr.

1080
02:26:01,878 --> 02:26:03,837
Nor I. I want to live.

1081
02:26:05,090 --> 02:26:07,967
I want a home and children and peace.

1082
02:26:07,968 --> 02:26:09,927
- Do you?
- Aye, I do.

1083
02:26:09,928 --> 02:26:12,221
I've asked God for those things.

1084
02:26:12,847 --> 02:26:14,765
It's all for nothing
if you don't have freedom.

1085
02:26:14,766 --> 02:26:17,685
- That's just a dream, William.
- A dream? Just a...

1086
02:26:19,145 --> 02:26:23,023
Then what have we been doing
all this time?

1087
02:26:23,483 --> 02:26:25,192
We've lived that dream.

1088
02:26:25,193 --> 02:26:28,946
Your dream isn't about freedom.
It's about Murron.

1089
02:26:28,947 --> 02:26:31,949
You're doing this to be a hero
'cause you think she sees you.

1090
02:26:31,950 --> 02:26:34,868
I don't think she sees me.
I know she does.

1091
02:26:35,704 --> 02:26:38,038
And your father sees you, too.

1092
02:26:47,924 --> 02:26:49,091
Jesus.

1093
02:26:51,386 --> 02:26:53,554
Get up. Give us your hand.

1094
02:26:56,891 --> 02:26:58,767
Shall I come with you?

1095
02:27:00,020 --> 02:27:02,396
No. I'll go alone.

1096
02:27:04,441 --> 02:27:06,191
I'll see you after.

1097
02:27:07,068 --> 02:27:08,235
Right.

1098
02:27:12,615 --> 02:27:15,117
Sooner rather than later, I hope.

1099
02:27:21,458 --> 02:27:23,751
- He won't come.
- He will.

1100
02:27:24,919 --> 02:27:26,503
I know he will.

1101
02:27:40,643 --> 02:27:42,519
Milord, he approaches!

1102
02:28:26,439 --> 02:28:28,190
No!

1103
02:28:32,821 --> 02:28:34,780
Stay out of it, Robert!

1104
02:28:36,908 --> 02:28:38,742
You lied! You lied!

1105
02:28:42,122 --> 02:28:45,499
Bruce is not to be hurt!
That's the arrangement!

1106
02:28:53,299 --> 02:28:54,925
Father!

1107
02:29:00,932 --> 02:29:03,809
You rotting bastard!

1108
02:29:04,352 --> 02:29:06,311
Why? Why?

1109
02:29:10,984 --> 02:29:13,819
Longshanks required Wallace.

1110
02:29:14,320 --> 02:29:16,029
So did our nobles.

1111
02:29:16,614 --> 02:29:19,741
That was the price of your crown.

1112
02:29:19,742 --> 02:29:20,868
Die!

1113
02:29:22,620 --> 02:29:24,496
I want you to die!

1114
02:29:24,497 --> 02:29:28,959
Soon enough, I'll be dead
and you'll be king.

1115
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:31,295
I don't want anything from you.

1116
02:29:31,838 --> 02:29:33,464
You're not a man!

1117
02:29:34,299 --> 02:29:36,383
And you're not my father.

1118
02:29:40,430 --> 02:29:45,100
You're my son,
and you have always known my mind.

1119
02:29:47,187 --> 02:29:48,562
You deceived me.

1120
02:29:48,563 --> 02:29:51,148
You let yourself be deceived.

1121
02:29:51,149 --> 02:29:54,693
In your heart, you always knew
what had to happen here.

1122
02:29:58,239 --> 02:30:01,867
At last, you know what it means to hate.

1123
02:30:06,247 --> 02:30:08,499
Now you're ready to be a king.

1124
02:30:10,418 --> 02:30:14,546
My hate will die with you.

1125
02:30:19,761 --> 02:30:21,595
William Wallace,

1126
02:30:21,596 --> 02:30:24,306
you stand in taint of high treason.

1127
02:30:25,308 --> 02:30:26,642
Against whom?

1128
02:30:26,643 --> 02:30:28,352
Against your king.

1129
02:30:29,771 --> 02:30:31,772
Have you anything to say?

1130
02:30:32,690 --> 02:30:34,733
Never in my whole life

1131
02:30:36,402 --> 02:30:38,695
did I swear allegiance to him.

1132
02:30:39,948 --> 02:30:42,824
It matters not. He is your king.

1133
02:30:45,703 --> 02:30:48,622
Confess, and you may
receive a quick death.

1134
02:30:49,582 --> 02:30:52,417
Deny, and you must be purified by pain.

1135
02:30:52,418 --> 02:30:59,383
Do you confess?

1136
02:31:05,265 --> 02:31:08,809
Then on the morrow,
you shall receive your purification.

1137
02:31:20,989 --> 02:31:22,781
- Your Highness.
- I will see the prisoner.

1138
02:31:22,782 --> 02:31:24,542
We've got orders
from the king that nobody...

1139
02:31:24,543 --> 02:31:27,003
The king will be dead in a month
and his son is a weakling.

1140
02:31:27,004 --> 02:31:29,204
Who do you think
will rule this kingdom?

1141
02:31:29,205 --> 02:31:30,998
Now open this door.

1142
02:31:32,959 --> 02:31:34,251
Majesty.

1143
02:31:40,925 --> 02:31:43,010
Come on, filth. Up on your feet.

1144
02:31:43,011 --> 02:31:44,428
Stop it!

1145
02:31:45,263 --> 02:31:46,597
Leave me.

1146
02:31:47,473 --> 02:31:49,141
I said leave me!

1147
02:32:02,238 --> 02:32:03,572
Milady.

1148
02:32:04,741 --> 02:32:09,077
Sir, I come to beg you

1149
02:32:11,122 --> 02:32:13,665
to confess all
and swear allegiance to the king

1150
02:32:13,666 --> 02:32:15,876
that he might show you mercy.

1151
02:32:16,753 --> 02:32:19,212
Will he show mercy to my country?

1152
02:32:20,006 --> 02:32:24,384
Mercy is to die quickly,
perhaps even live in a tower.

1153
02:32:24,385 --> 02:32:26,887
In time, who knows what can happen

1154
02:32:28,514 --> 02:32:30,724
if you can only live.

1155
02:32:35,188 --> 02:32:37,022
If I swear to him,

1156
02:32:37,815 --> 02:32:40,984
then all that I am is dead already.

1157
02:32:50,411 --> 02:32:53,080
You will die. It will be awful.

1158
02:32:53,081 --> 02:32:55,082
Every man dies.

1159
02:32:57,752 --> 02:32:59,878
Not every man really lives.

1160
02:33:06,177 --> 02:33:07,719
Drink this.

1161
02:33:09,055 --> 02:33:11,348
It will dull your pain.

1162
02:33:11,349 --> 02:33:15,227
No. It will numb my wits,
and I must have them all.

1163
02:33:16,479 --> 02:33:18,772
For if I'm senseless, or if I wail,

1164
02:33:19,273 --> 02:33:22,067
then Longshanks will have broken me.

1165
02:33:22,068 --> 02:33:24,945
I can't bear the thought of your torture.

1166
02:33:25,488 --> 02:33:26,780
Take it.

1167
02:33:31,619 --> 02:33:33,286
All right.

1168
02:34:20,668 --> 02:34:25,172
I have come to beg for the life
of William Wallace.

1169
02:34:27,467 --> 02:34:29,926
You're quite taken with him, aren't you?

1170
02:34:30,428 --> 02:34:32,095
I respect him.

1171
02:34:33,765 --> 02:34:35,640
At worst, he was a worthy enemy.

1172
02:34:35,641 --> 02:34:40,479
Show mercy, O thou great king,
and win the respect of your own people.

1173
02:34:50,114 --> 02:34:55,035
Even now, you are incapable of mercy.

1174
02:35:01,834 --> 02:35:03,335
And you...

1175
02:35:07,507 --> 02:35:10,634
To you,
that word is as unfamiliar as love.

1176
02:35:11,344 --> 02:35:15,847
Before he lost his powers of speech,
he told me his one comfort was

1177
02:35:15,848 --> 02:35:18,934
that he would live
to know Wallace was dead.

1178
02:35:37,286 --> 02:35:38,703
You see,

1179
02:35:40,623 --> 02:35:43,124
death comes to us all.

1180
02:35:52,552 --> 02:35:58,098
But before it comes to you, know this.

1181
02:35:58,099 --> 02:36:00,225
Your blood dies with you.

1182
02:36:02,895 --> 02:36:06,106
A child who is not of your line grows
in my belly.

1183
02:36:09,360 --> 02:36:13,071
Your son will not sit long on the throne,
I swear it.

1184
02:36:50,818 --> 02:36:52,819
I'm so afraid.

1185
02:37:00,828 --> 02:37:04,706
Give me the strength to die well.

1186
02:37:28,940 --> 02:37:30,649
Here he comes!

1187
02:38:59,655 --> 02:39:02,657
Now behold the awful price of treason!

1188
02:39:09,457 --> 02:39:11,791
You will fall to your knees now,

1189
02:39:13,711 --> 02:39:16,629
declare yourself the king's loyal subject

1190
02:39:17,465 --> 02:39:19,466
and beg his mercy.

1191
02:39:26,474 --> 02:39:28,349
And you shall have it.

1192
02:39:39,820 --> 02:39:41,237
Rope!

1193
02:40:03,260 --> 02:40:04,719
Stretch him!

1194
02:40:07,014 --> 02:40:10,183
That's it! Stretch him!

1195
02:40:25,908 --> 02:40:27,826
Shame! Shame!

1196
02:40:47,638 --> 02:40:49,848
Pleasant, yes?

1197
02:40:52,893 --> 02:40:54,894
Rise to your knees,

1198
02:40:54,895 --> 02:40:57,730
kiss the royal emblem on my cloak,

1199
02:40:57,731 --> 02:40:59,899
and you will feel no more.

1200
02:41:41,525 --> 02:41:42,859
Rack him!

1201
02:42:37,373 --> 02:42:38,873
Enough?

1202
02:43:31,635 --> 02:43:35,054
It can all end right now.

1203
02:43:36,390 --> 02:43:37,932
Peace.

1204
02:43:39,184 --> 02:43:42,353
Please, just say it.

1205
02:43:43,439 --> 02:43:46,149
Cry out, "Mercy."

1206
02:43:56,827 --> 02:43:58,369
Mercy!

1207
02:43:58,370 --> 02:44:01,914
- Mercy!
- Mercy!

1208
02:44:05,878 --> 02:44:07,170
Cry out.

1209
02:44:07,546 --> 02:44:10,757
Mercy! Mercy!

1210
02:44:13,635 --> 02:44:15,219
Just say it.

1211
02:44:15,554 --> 02:44:18,222
Mercy.

1212
02:44:18,223 --> 02:44:21,434
Mercy! Mercy!

1213
02:44:40,579 --> 02:44:42,789
Mercy, William.

1214
02:44:42,790 --> 02:44:44,999
- Mercy.
- Jesus, now say it.

1215
02:44:51,131 --> 02:44:54,592
The prisoner wishes to say a word.

1216
02:44:55,010 --> 02:44:57,637
Mercy! Mercy!

1217
02:44:57,638 --> 02:44:59,639
Mercy!

1218
02:45:14,405 --> 02:45:15,405
Freedom!

1219
02:47:10,020 --> 02:47:12,480
<i>After the beheading,</i>

1220
02:47:12,481 --> 02:47:15,691
<i>William Wallace's body
was torn to pieces.</i>

1221
02:47:18,612 --> 02:47:21,572
<i>His head was set on London Bridge,</i>

1222
02:47:23,116 --> 02:47:28,788
<i>his arms and legs sent
to the four corners of Britain</i>

1223
02:47:28,789 --> 02:47:30,790
<i>as a warning.</i>

1224
02:47:30,791 --> 02:47:35,711
<i>It did not have the effect
that Longshanks planned.</i>

1225
02:47:36,547 --> 02:47:39,757
<i>And I, Robert the Bruce,</i>

1226
02:47:39,758 --> 02:47:44,845
<i>rode out to pay homage
to the armies of the English king</i>

1227
02:47:44,846 --> 02:47:48,140
<i>and accept his endorsement
of my crown.</i>

1228
02:47:48,934 --> 02:47:51,727
I hope you've washed your arse
this morning.

1229
02:47:51,728 --> 02:47:54,188
It's about to be kissed by a king.

1230
02:48:23,468 --> 02:48:25,886
Come. Let's get it over with.

1231
02:48:38,358 --> 02:48:39,483
Stop!

1232
02:48:57,711 --> 02:48:59,879
You have bled with Wallace!

1233
02:49:05,844 --> 02:49:07,553
Now bleed with me.

1234
02:49:48,512 --> 02:49:50,846
Wallace! Wallace!

1235
02:49:50,847 --> 02:49:56,018
- Wallace! Wallace!
- Wallace! Wallace!

1236
02:50:14,955 --> 02:50:17,707
<i>In the year of our Lord, 1314,</i>

1237
02:50:18,917 --> 02:50:22,294
<i>patriots of Scotland,
starving and outnumbered,</i>

1238
02:50:22,671 --> 02:50:26,173
<i>charged the fields of Bannockburn.</i>

1239
02:50:26,174 --> 02:50:29,218
<i>They fought like warrior poets.</i>

1240
02:50:29,219 --> 02:50:31,303
<i>They fought like Scotsmen,</i>

1241
02:50:32,431 --> 02:50:34,306
<i>and won their freedom.</i>

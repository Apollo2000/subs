3
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,869
<i>Hey, Lion.</i>

4
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:39,472
<i>Hey, Lion.</i>

5
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,448
Brother, you up?

6
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,483
Yeah,
what's wrong?

7
00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:57,124
We're gonna be good,
Lion.

8
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:58,826
Yeah, I know, man.

9
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:02,462
I mean,
I can see it.

10
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:05,665
I can see our future
when I close my eyes.

11
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,804
We got it all laid out
in front of us.

12
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:14,075
I can see our house.

13
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:17,144
We each got a walk-in closet
for all our silk shirts

14
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:20,480
and handmade
Italian suits.

15
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:25,719
- You know where it is?
- In California.

16
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:30,258
Stan, if I don't go to sleep,
I'm not gonna win tomorrow.

17
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,826
We're not gonna lose.

18
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:35,562
It's fate.

19
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:40,767
<i>With a new day
comes new opportunities.</i>

20
00:01:40,902 --> 00:01:43,503
<i>A chance to change everything.</i>

21
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,139
<i>What we can or cannot do</i>

22
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:48,976
<i>comes down to what
we believe is possible.</i>

23
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,114
<i>What will you choose,
fear or hope?</i>

24
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:56,416
<i>I challenge you to make
your life extraordinary.</i>

25
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,854
<i>What does it take
to live an extraordinary life?</i>

26
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,055
<i>Having focus.</i>

27
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:21,909
Up and at 'em.
Time to eat.

28
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:26,013
Lion.

29
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:27,747
Yo, Lion.

30
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:36,756
Come on, Ash.
Eat this shit.

31
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:48,869
Your wrist
bothering you?

32
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,704
Just aches.

33
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,979
It's fight day,
baby.

34
00:02:59,814 --> 00:03:02,049
I'll get you some ice
and a hot towel.

35
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:05,019
None of that mixie goes to Ash.
All right?

36
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:10,891
Come here.

37
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:15,262
Good boy.

38
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:24,171
All right.

39
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:29,343
Oh, fuck!

40
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,746
All right,
come on.

41
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,616
Put your hand on the
frame, all right?

42
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,026
Right.
Let's do it.

43
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,695
Let's loosen up.

44
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,892
One, two.

45
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,427
One, two.

46
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,895
One, two.

47
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,038
What's going on,
Barbara?

48
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:12,406
Looking good.

49
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,276
Something wonderful's
happening tonight, ladies.

50
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:16,844
I can feel it!

51
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,881
Beast from the northeast
right there.

52
00:06:21,015 --> 00:06:24,418
Lion Kaminsky in the
fight of the century.

53
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:26,086
That right, bro?

54
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,222
Would you shut up
and go back to work?

55
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:32,493
You know, Lion's fighting Lefty
Denunzio tonight down at Raoul's.

56
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:33,894
And who the fuck
is that?

57
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:35,829
Just some dude
who's old as shit.

58
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:37,932
You should come.
It's gonna be fun.

59
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,934
The odds are stacked
up against us.

60
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:43,003
I mean, it's stupid, bro.
We can't lose.

61
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:45,573
You can come in right
now on the ground floor.

62
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:48,842
You're a bookie for your own team, huh?

63
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:52,079
Kaminsky, you're
a fucking weasel, man.

64
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:57,151
Why you gotta be like that, Clem?

65
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:00,487
See, this is your problem. That's why you're
going to be here for the rest of your life.

66
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,490
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Making tea towels and shit.

67
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:05,792
While me and Lion,
we're gonna be over in California.

68
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,294
Right, bro?

69
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:09,463
Building
the Lion brand.

70
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:11,665
- Ooh.
- Making tracksuits, sweatshirts,

71
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,267
getting sucked off
by movie stars.

72
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,869
Who's gonna suck you off
with them fucked-up shoes?

73
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:17,905
Oh, sorry. Excuse me, man.

74
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,608
- I gotta take this. Yo, Lion.
- Fucked-up shoes, talking about getting sucked.

75
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,142
Cover me, all right?

76
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:35,122
Fucking nice car, man.

77
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:36,657
I always wanted
one of these.

78
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,359
You got the money?

79
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,162
Yeah, I got it.

80
00:07:43,364 --> 00:07:45,765
Pepper couldn't bother
showing up himself, huh?

81
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,635
Yeah, I guess
he's big-time now.

82
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,637
That's cool.

83
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,105
It's cool.

84
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:54,642
What is this?
Pepper said you owe him two grand.

85
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,410
It's all I got.

86
00:07:57,278 --> 00:07:59,580
Un-fucking-believable,
man.

87
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:00,948
Buck...

88
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,085
ask Pepper if he'll let it
ride on the fight tonight.

89
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:06,220
What?

90
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:09,123
Come on, the kid's
looking unbelievable.

91
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:12,059
You never learn,
do you, Kaminsky?

92
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,361
I'm just excited.
Pow, pow.

93
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,230
You're gonna get your legs broken, man.

94
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,966
I'm telling you,
it's a sure thing.

95
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:28,008
- Ah, all right.
- We good?

96
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:30,177
He says he'll float you
the rest.

97
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:33,480
- All right!
- Get out of the car, man.

98
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:36,717
- Close the door.
- Buy this car off you tomorrow.

99
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:46,593
How you feeling?

100
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:47,895
- Great.
- Yeah?

101
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,263
Yeah, I feel great.

102
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,231
You know,
we cannot afford to lose tonight.

103
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,501
Yeah, I know.
How much is the cut?

104
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:57,104
Look, you don't need to worry about
that, all right?

105
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,439
You handle your business
in there,

106
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:00,974
and we will get a cut
you will not believe.

107
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:05,713
I mean, a win tonight will
open up a lot of doors for us.

108
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:07,748
We could change
our lives tonight.

109
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:08,849
All right.

110
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,617
Come on, give me
a little roar.

111
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,286
- Let me hear you roar.
- No, man.

112
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,621
- I'm trying to focus.
- Give me a little roar, Lion.

113
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:17,024
What, are you
fucking embarrassed

114
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,759
- in front of the dishwashers?
- No.

115
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:34,942
Use the jab.
Use the jab.

116
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:48,389
He can't touch you.
This guy's older than dirt!

117
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,358
Beautiful!

118
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,660
Beautiful.

119
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:55,996
Make him fight
another day.

120
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:59,466
Yes! Yes! Come on!

121
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:03,203
That's it!
Stay down! It's over.

122
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:06,173
You're too old for this, man.
You look awful.

123
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,676
Let him up.
Let him up.

124
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,248
That-a-boy!
Work the kidneys!

125
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:17,551
Work the kidneys!
Make this motherfucker piss blood!

126
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:22,656
Don't get stuck!

127
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,795
That's it! Work the kidneys!
That-a-boy!

128
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:30,431
- What is he doing here, Stan?
- What are you talking about?

129
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:31,866
What the fuck
is he doing here?

130
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,204
- That's nothing to do with us!
- You made a deal with...

131
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,206
No, man!
That's nothing to do...

132
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,241
Lion! Protect yourself!

133
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:45,379
Protect yourself!
Lion! Block!

134
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,217
Done. Done.

135
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,286
All right, I'm done.

136
00:10:58,927 --> 00:11:00,761
You were supposed
to win, Lion.

137
00:11:01,863 --> 00:11:04,364
You shouldn't have lied to me, Stan.

138
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,835
You told me you wasn't gonna
deal with that scumbag no more.

139
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,136
Yeah, well,
we needed the money.

140
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,143
Stanley, where the hell
are we gonna go, man?

141
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:19,948
You know, for a guy who hates
moving as much as you do,

142
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,016
you really don't do much
to help the cause.

143
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,687
You were supposed
to fucking win.

144
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,723
Okay, Ash, come on.

145
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,166
Jesus!

146
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,135
Fuck!

147
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,439
Where you going?

148
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:51,111
Hey, I was looking
for you at the fight, man.

149
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:53,647
I didn't see you.
Did you not make it?

150
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,582
Fuck!

151
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:12,432
<i>You owe me money
you don't have.</i>

152
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,101
<i>I could kill you tonight,</i>

153
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,270
<i>but I'd never get a return
on my investment,</i>

154
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,606
<i>so I'm offering you
an opportunity.</i>

155
00:12:25,013 --> 00:12:26,413
Jungleland.

156
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:30,317
Battle royal for 100K.

157
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:35,155
Wild-ass, no-holds-barred,
bare-knuckle event.

158
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:36,690
A week from today.

159
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,693
I can get you
on the card.

160
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:42,329
- I could do that.
- Why?

161
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,598
Let's not look a gift horse
in the mouth here. This is...

162
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:47,668
No, I'm asking him why.
Nothing for nothing with you. Right, Pep?

163
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:51,138
I saw you.

164
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:55,208
I saw the way you moved
before you took that dive.

165
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:56,777
That look in your eye.

166
00:12:56,911 --> 00:12:58,378
That...

167
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:00,480
That rage.

168
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:02,984
Heard you could've been
Golden Gloves

169
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,285
out in Hartford before Stan
got your ass kicked out

170
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:06,720
the way he always do,
right?

171
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:09,256
Now, wait, that was
a complicated situation.

172
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,825
Now look at you.

173
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:15,429
Fighting like a fucking savage.
For what?

174
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:17,464
Peanuts?

175
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,133
Plus,
you got no choice.

176
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,574
Where?

177
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:28,742
San Francisco.

178
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,583
There is one thing
I need.

179
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:43,757
Are you decent
in there?

180
00:13:50,631 --> 00:13:54,434
Sky...
meet Stan Kaminsky.

181
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:59,172
Him and his brother, Lion,
they'll take you out west.

182
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,575
Come on, Pepper.

183
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:04,211
I can't be
moving girls right now.

184
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,379
No, it ain't
like that.

185
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:06,948
I don't know...

186
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:09,216
I'd handle it or
have one of my guys handle it,

187
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,418
but, look,
she's a friend of the family.

188
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,153
Here's my
problem, all right?

189
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:14,721
It's always been
the two of us.

190
00:14:14,856 --> 00:14:17,859
- This could be a complication.
- She's cool. She's cool.

191
00:14:17,992 --> 00:14:20,128
She's a bit of a
handful, but she's cool.

192
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,628
Just keep an eye
on her.

193
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:23,865
All right.
Just 'cause I gotta ask.

194
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:26,400
This doesn't have anything
to do with Yates, does it?

195
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,670
- 'Cause I'm just not trying to be...
- Stanley.

196
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:31,939
Take her
to this address

197
00:14:32,073 --> 00:14:35,375
by this time next week,
and Lion stays on the card.

198
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:39,546
- "Party Animals"?
- Don't fuck it up.

199
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,516
Opportunities like this
don't knock twice.

200
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:51,692
Hey.

201
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,313
You serious?

202
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:14,581
I left some petty cash

203
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:17,551
and a special gift for you
in the glove.

204
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,519
Told you
this was my car.

205
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:25,292
We're in an economic
boom, Kaminsky.

206
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,294
Go forth, prosper.

207
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,366
What the fuck?

208
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:49,917
<i>If you
understand the building blocks</i>

209
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:52,719
<i>of key relations,
you can have ultimate success.</i>

210
00:15:52,854 --> 00:15:55,689
<i>It's the pyramid
of achievement.</i>

211
00:15:55,823 --> 00:15:59,026
<i>It is only in our darkest
moments, our moment...</i>

212
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,157
Are you still
working on that?

213
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,225
Go right ahead.

214
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:09,496
That's quite an
appetite you got on you.

215
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,332
You ever take a break
to talk?

216
00:17:14,135 --> 00:17:16,037
What's with
the rattail?

217
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,772
I had it since,
like, forever.

218
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:20,507
I'm thinking
of cutting it.

219
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,310
No, you're not.

220
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:23,376
You should.

221
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,512
You see?

222
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,949
You don't know what
you're talking about.

223
00:17:28,082 --> 00:17:29,583
That's
his lion's tail.

224
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,418
This gives him power.

225
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,188
Look at him.
He's like a wild animal.

226
00:17:34,322 --> 00:17:37,724
Get off me, man. Fuck off, Stan. Jesus.

227
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,928
Hey.
I love you.

228
00:17:41,062 --> 00:17:42,163
All right.

229
00:17:42,296 --> 00:17:43,931
- Tell me you love me.
- I love you.

230
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,970
Tell us
about yourself.

231
00:17:49,103 --> 00:17:51,272
I like to know who
we're traveling with.

232
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,373
What do you
want to know?

233
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,375
Like, who you are.
What do you do?

234
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,644
Where are you from?
Anything.

235
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,348
Look, you seem like
really nice guys.

236
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,050
I'm just not really
in the mood to talk.

237
00:18:05,353 --> 00:18:06,753
Gotcha.

238
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,562
I do have one other
question though.

239
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,797
Just...
Last question.

240
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:23,804
Are you like a...

241
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:27,674
Am I what?

242
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:31,145
I mean,
you know.

243
00:18:34,315 --> 00:18:35,782
A pro.

244
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:39,287
- Stan. Come on.
- I just meant because of the circumstances.

245
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,188
I'm not a hooker.

246
00:18:41,322 --> 00:18:43,657
It's nice to know I make a
good first impression though.

247
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,126
That's all
I wanted to know.

248
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:48,528
We don't think that, okay?
My brother's an idiot.

249
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:52,066
I'm not an idiot,
I just...

250
00:18:54,135 --> 00:18:56,469
We've been working
towards something.

251
00:18:56,603 --> 00:19:00,774
Something...
Something very big, all right?

252
00:19:00,908 --> 00:19:04,178
I mean, these are spectacular
goals we're talking about.

253
00:19:04,312 --> 00:19:08,149
And since we gotta spend the
next week together, I just...

254
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,853
I just need there to be a level
of trust between us, that's all.

255
00:19:14,989 --> 00:19:17,557
I gotta
use the bathroom.

256
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,961
Again?

257
00:19:20,094 --> 00:19:24,031
I'm sorry. Is that in violation
of your spectacular goals?

258
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,702
I think she's doing
drugs in there.

259
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:30,137
She seems
kind of cool.

260
00:19:30,271 --> 00:19:32,306
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

261
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,673
Hey,
look at me.

262
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,776
No distractions.

263
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:41,382
- All right?
- Come on. Just be nice, Stan.

264
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,118
- Come on. It's nice to be nice.
- I'm nice. I'm always nice.

265
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:46,720
Got a hundred
grand on the line.

266
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:48,655
We good to go,
princess?

267
00:20:21,188 --> 00:20:22,589
Looks like you're
in luck, folks.

268
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,226
So, that's one night
in the Caesar suite?

269
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,527
That's the nicest
suite you got?

270
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,363
The Caesar is the
only suite we offer.

271
00:20:29,497 --> 00:20:30,931
We'll take it.

272
00:20:31,065 --> 00:20:34,435
Do you have a
card to hold the reservation?

273
00:20:40,408 --> 00:20:42,176
Sir?

274
00:20:45,446 --> 00:20:47,081
I'll pay cash,
amigo.

275
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:53,087
Don't trust the banks.

276
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:06,467
Pass the fucking
grappa, baby.

277
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,436
There's a hot tub.

278
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:10,304
And only one bed.

279
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:15,209
Requesting backup.

280
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:18,479
We got a hot tub situation
over at the Venus de Milo.

281
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:22,183
Gonna need 12 Coors Lights
and three Mountain Dews, stat.

282
00:21:22,316 --> 00:21:24,285
Do you guys mind
if I jump in here first?

283
00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:25,352
Sure, go ahead.

284
00:21:25,486 --> 00:21:27,587
I'd actually...

285
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,126
All right.

286
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:34,627
You want to do this?

287
00:21:46,207 --> 00:21:49,176
- You want some of this?
- Don't knock the fucking ribs, man, don't.

288
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:52,012
Want to fight? Want the toe pop?
Want the toe pop?

289
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:56,783
Not the toe!
Not the toe.

290
00:21:56,917 --> 00:21:59,153
You get the toe.
You get the toe.

291
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:01,956
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?

292
00:22:03,057 --> 00:22:04,592
Got you back.
I got you back.

293
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:06,527
- You ain't got nothing.
- Oh, shit.

294
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,262
Rear naked choke.

295
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:11,265
- You ain't got it. You ain't got shit.
- After I put you out.

296
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,436
You ain't got it.
You ain't got this.

297
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:19,273
- Not that hard to put you out.
- All right, all right.

298
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:22,877
Motherfucker.

299
00:22:28,115 --> 00:22:29,316
All right.

300
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:32,119
You want to watch
something?

301
00:22:36,957 --> 00:22:38,259
Want to watch that?

302
00:22:38,392 --> 00:22:39,994
<i>A strong showing
tonight by Kreski.</i>

303
00:22:40,127 --> 00:22:41,562
<i>Obviously,
he's in the middle of three</i>

304
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:42,830
<i>of his most exciting
performances.</i>

305
00:22:42,963 --> 00:22:44,298
<i>First with Nunes,</i>

306
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:46,967
<i>then last month against
Pirelli, and now tonight,</i>

307
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:50,471
<i>a career-making caliber fight
against the champion, Emmet.</i>

308
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:54,842
<i>A strong, experienced,
and very motivated opponent.</i>

309
00:22:54,975 --> 00:22:56,544
<i>Well, at 5'7" and 159,</i>

310
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:59,880
<i>this middleweight is just one
pound from light heavyweight...</i>

311
00:23:00,014 --> 00:23:02,216
I'm going to
take Ash for a walk.

312
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:03,184
I'll be back.

313
00:23:03,317 --> 00:23:05,319
<i>Thirteen KO victories</i>

314
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:07,354
<i>in 19 professional fights.</i>

315
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:15,462
Get dressed, Rocky.
We're going out.

316
00:23:15,596 --> 00:23:16,864
Where?

317
00:23:16,997 --> 00:23:19,166
Saw a bar around the
corner we could go to.

318
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:22,970
Cheers to new friends.

319
00:23:39,153 --> 00:23:40,753
What's happening,
boss?

320
00:23:40,888 --> 00:23:42,356
- Did you see those...
- Whoo!

321
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:44,491
Darlene, get your
fuckin' ass out here!

322
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:45,993
Never mind.

323
00:23:57,204 --> 00:23:58,305
Hi.

324
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:03,344
I came to say congratulations.

325
00:24:03,477 --> 00:24:04,511
He's a lucky man.

326
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:06,547
Oh, um...

327
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,449
It's my sister Gina.

328
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:10,551
I don't know why I'm
wearing that stupid thing.

329
00:24:10,684 --> 00:24:12,785
Which one's Gina?

330
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,555
Uh... go big
or go home.

331
00:24:16,457 --> 00:24:18,791
- Savage.
- Yeah.

332
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:22,029
I like your pants.

333
00:24:22,162 --> 00:24:25,232
- Yeah? Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

334
00:24:25,366 --> 00:24:26,967
They're from Italy.

335
00:24:27,101 --> 00:24:29,803
I like the way
they make my dick look.

336
00:24:33,207 --> 00:24:36,310
You're funny.

337
00:24:36,443 --> 00:24:39,346
Yeah.
So, did, uh...

338
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:42,216
Gina get you
your own room?

339
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:47,488
Mm-mmm. I'm sharing with
six other girls and my aunt.

340
00:24:48,255 --> 00:24:50,724
- I got the Caesar suite, but...
- Oh.

341
00:24:50,858 --> 00:24:52,593
...I'm sharing
with my brother.

342
00:24:52,726 --> 00:24:55,763
He's resting right now.
He's a professional athlete, so...

343
00:24:55,896 --> 00:24:58,832
- Wow.
- You know how that goes.

344
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:01,168
Hmm. Well...

345
00:25:02,703 --> 00:25:04,171
There's a pool.

346
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:07,641
You think it's heated?

347
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:10,544
Do you actually care?

348
00:25:23,924 --> 00:25:25,292
Thanks.

349
00:25:27,461 --> 00:25:28,529
If I went to college,

350
00:25:28,662 --> 00:25:30,798
I wouldn't waste my time
playing stupid games

351
00:25:30,931 --> 00:25:32,866
like these rich pricks.

352
00:25:34,635 --> 00:25:36,737
Yeah, me neither.

353
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,940
I bet you'd be too busy getting
it on with all the girls, huh?

354
00:25:40,074 --> 00:25:42,976
No, I mean I'd be taking
my classes real seriously

355
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,578
'cause of
how expensive it is.

356
00:25:44,712 --> 00:25:47,414
I would read
a bunch of books

357
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:50,284
where you gotta, like,
know shit to understand them,

358
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:52,920
and I would study
theater and fashion.

359
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:55,322
Yeah, you like to sew, right?

360
00:25:56,323 --> 00:25:58,692
I saw what you did at
the hotel with the robe.

361
00:25:58,827 --> 00:26:00,728
And your name?

362
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:03,063
It looked good,
like, professional.

363
00:26:04,365 --> 00:26:05,399
Thank you.

364
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:13,006
Me and Stan wanna get our initials
stitched onto some dress shirts.

365
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,942
So, if we make
a bit of money,

366
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:18,445
hopefully we can
afford your talents.

367
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:23,283
My mom taught me
how to do that.

368
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,652
Yeah? Where?

369
00:26:26,286 --> 00:26:28,088
Some boring-ass town.

370
00:26:28,222 --> 00:26:30,524
Not that far from here,
actually.

371
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,896
I'm not really
that interesting.

372
00:26:36,997 --> 00:26:38,799
What about you?
Where are you from?

373
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:40,835
All over.

374
00:26:40,968 --> 00:26:43,570
New Bedford, Portsmouth,

375
00:26:43,704 --> 00:26:45,939
Hartford, Nashua,

376
00:26:46,073 --> 00:26:48,208
everywhere.

377
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:52,212
You got parents,
or does Stanley cover that too?

378
00:26:53,414 --> 00:26:56,049
Our mom died
when I was real young.

379
00:26:58,786 --> 00:27:00,053
What about your dad?

380
00:27:00,187 --> 00:27:03,090
Well, he didn't want us. So...

381
00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:11,198
That must've been lonely, you
know, not having any parents.

382
00:27:11,331 --> 00:27:13,233
Well,
I always had my brother.

383
00:27:17,271 --> 00:27:19,206
You got any scars?

384
00:27:20,441 --> 00:27:21,608
I got some.

385
00:27:21,742 --> 00:27:24,211
All on my hands, though.
Not on my face.

386
00:27:24,344 --> 00:27:26,480
- Can I touch it?
- If you want.

387
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:30,852
Go ahead.
Just do it.

388
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,712
You don't seem
like a boxer to me.

389
00:27:58,847 --> 00:28:00,581
What do you mean?

390
00:28:01,415 --> 00:28:03,952
I don't know.
You haven't got that thing.

391
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:07,654
What thing? This thing?

392
00:28:08,957 --> 00:28:10,624
I don't walk around going
like this to people?

393
00:28:10,757 --> 00:28:13,828
"What the fuck are you looking
at, huh?

394
00:28:13,962 --> 00:28:15,496
I'm a fucking ogre."

395
00:28:15,629 --> 00:28:16,563
Exactly.

396
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:18,232
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

397
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:20,200
Get the fuck
out of here.

398
00:28:22,135 --> 00:28:23,704
It's a compliment.

399
00:28:26,073 --> 00:28:28,208
I'll take
the compliment.

400
00:28:28,342 --> 00:28:30,444
Maybe that's
my advantage.

401
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:34,581
People underestimate you.

402
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:37,117
I guess.

403
00:28:39,854 --> 00:28:41,421
Me too.

404
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:02,109
Whoo!

405
00:29:15,924 --> 00:29:17,491
Lion.

406
00:29:21,128 --> 00:29:23,063
Lion.

407
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:39,313
Oh, fuck.

408
00:29:41,648 --> 00:29:42,817
Oh, fuck.

409
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:52,492
Fucking assholes.

410
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,795
What?

411
00:29:55,762 --> 00:29:57,164
What?

412
00:29:57,297 --> 00:30:00,400
He said the only way that we can
play is if I give him a blow job.

413
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:05,339
He said that?

414
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:07,008
Can we just get
the fuck out of here?

415
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,709
Shit.

416
00:30:08,843 --> 00:30:10,677
Lion, don't.

417
00:30:10,812 --> 00:30:13,647
How's it going?
All right?

418
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,615
How's it going?

419
00:30:14,748 --> 00:30:16,283
Doing pretty good.
What's up, bro?

420
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:18,052
I just want to know
why you think it's okay

421
00:30:18,185 --> 00:30:19,854
to speak to my friend
like that.

422
00:30:19,988 --> 00:30:22,723
Uh, I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

423
00:30:22,857 --> 00:30:24,558
Yes, you do.

424
00:30:24,691 --> 00:30:27,862
She said you said something real
impolite to her. I want to know why.

425
00:30:27,996 --> 00:30:30,865
No, she came over and
asked me about my belt.

426
00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:32,033
You are a liar.

427
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:33,300
- What did I say?
- I came over here.

428
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:34,534
I asked
if we could play.

429
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:36,203
You said the only way
I could play

430
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:38,538
- is if I gave you a blow job.
- Okay, all right.

431
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:41,441
See, here's the problem.
This bitch is fucking insane.

432
00:30:41,575 --> 00:30:43,310
You should beat the
fucking shit out of him.

433
00:30:43,443 --> 00:30:45,278
Isn't there a townie bar
you guys can go over to?

434
00:30:45,412 --> 00:30:46,680
We're not
fucking townies.

435
00:30:46,814 --> 00:30:49,316
And fuck you! I'll scratch
your fucking eyes out!

436
00:30:49,449 --> 00:30:51,019
Look down on me,
you piece of shit?

437
00:30:51,151 --> 00:30:53,553
- Orphan Annie, you know what?
- Sorry. Hey!

438
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:56,356
- My boyfriend is a boxer.
- Something will get you.

439
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,625
Something will get you.
That's all I want you to know.

440
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:01,461
- Something or somebody will get you.
- Are you drinking?

441
00:31:01,595 --> 00:31:03,563
What are you doing?
You fucking drinking? You drunk?

442
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:05,967
- I'm having a couple drinks. Why?
- Just everyone,

443
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,300
go back to what
you were doing.

444
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:10,270
Who are you,
the fucking social worker?

445
00:31:10,404 --> 00:31:12,140
Why you being
an asshole?

446
00:31:12,272 --> 00:31:15,275
Why don't you go to the bar.
I got a tab open. Name's Clay.

447
00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:16,576
Get yourself
whatever you want.

448
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,311
Oh, I see. We can't afford
our own drinks?

449
00:31:18,445 --> 00:31:20,180
- Is that what you're implying?
- I didn't say that.

450
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:22,950
- That's what you thought though, right?
- Maybe a little.

451
00:31:23,084 --> 00:31:25,419
- You're not listening to me.
- I gotta go sit.

452
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:28,355
Guys like us don't have the luxury
of settling things with credit cards.

453
00:31:28,488 --> 00:31:31,092
- We gotta go outside, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

454
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:33,694
Toe to toe.
On the street.

455
00:31:33,828 --> 00:31:35,963
But that's not what you
do, is it?

456
00:31:37,531 --> 00:31:39,901
'Cause you don't know
what it's like to suffer.

457
00:31:40,034 --> 00:31:42,769
I mean, do you know what
it's like to be in pain?

458
00:31:43,503 --> 00:31:46,074
I've been to
fucking prison, man.

459
00:31:46,206 --> 00:31:47,774
You know?

460
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:51,045
- Check that out. Check that out.
- Okay, all right.

461
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:52,345
No, I'm not causing
a problem.

462
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:53,848
I'm just saying,
you can be nice.

463
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:55,016
Yep, I'm being nice.

464
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:56,249
Your buddy
just passed out!

465
00:31:56,383 --> 00:31:57,952
- Nice guy.
- Hey.

466
00:31:58,086 --> 00:32:00,154
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

467
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:01,521
What are you doing?

468
00:32:03,323 --> 00:32:05,325
- Where the fuck is Sky? Get up.
- What?

469
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:07,829
You just hit
my fucking car!

470
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,066
- Hey, are you okay?
- Sky!

471
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,433
Should I call somebody?

472
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:15,769
What the hell
are you doing?

473
00:32:15,903 --> 00:32:18,505
- Hey! Where you going?
- Wait there.

474
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:20,340
Sky!

475
00:32:23,177 --> 00:32:24,411
Sky!

476
00:32:25,245 --> 00:32:26,379
Slow down!

477
00:32:26,513 --> 00:32:28,281
Sky!

478
00:32:28,415 --> 00:32:30,852
What are you doing?

479
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:32,652
Sky!

480
00:32:34,188 --> 00:32:35,722
Get away!
Get away from me!

481
00:32:35,857 --> 00:32:37,859
- What the fuck is going on?
- Get away! Get off me!

482
00:32:37,992 --> 00:32:39,827
What the fuck did you
do to my brother?

483
00:32:39,961 --> 00:32:41,695
Get off! Get off!

484
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:43,730
- Calm down.
- Get the fuck away from me.

485
00:32:43,865 --> 00:32:46,200
- Get away!
- You're gonna get us fucking arrested.

486
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:49,137
Calm down! Calm down!

487
00:32:50,004 --> 00:32:51,705
All right, look,
I'll take my hand away,

488
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:54,242
but you gotta tell me
what the fuck is going on.

489
00:32:54,374 --> 00:32:57,677
Help me!
I won't fucking go back to him!

490
00:32:57,812 --> 00:32:59,279
Go back to who?

491
00:32:59,412 --> 00:33:01,348
Yates?

492
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:03,217
She's with fucking Yates?

493
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,253
I specifically fucking
asked you, man.

494
00:33:05,385 --> 00:33:07,621
- <i>You're overreacting.</i>
- You didn't want to take any of the heat,

495
00:33:07,754 --> 00:33:09,556
so you put it on me,
like I'm some kind of chump.

496
00:33:09,689 --> 00:33:11,725
<i>You had a debt to pay, Stan!
And somebody...</i>

497
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:14,128
You fucking set me up,
Pepper!

498
00:33:14,262 --> 00:33:15,863
<i>Listen,
motherfucker,</i>

499
00:33:15,997 --> 00:33:18,632
<i>I don't owe you shit.
All right?</i>

500
00:33:18,765 --> 00:33:21,102
<i>Of course
I set you up.</i>

501
00:33:21,235 --> 00:33:22,602
Yates?

502
00:33:22,736 --> 00:33:24,504
You know,
Yates thinks you found Sky.

503
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:26,908
<i>He thinks
you're responsible.</i>

504
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:29,877
<i>You know, uh,
you owe me a debt.</i>

505
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,884
Why the fuck am I
gonna look out for you?

506
00:33:37,018 --> 00:33:38,418
Hmm?

507
00:33:38,552 --> 00:33:40,387
You look out
for your brother.

508
00:33:41,155 --> 00:33:42,489
This is how
it works.

509
00:33:42,622 --> 00:33:46,726
<i>You said you wanted
to go to Jungleland.</i>

510
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:51,165
Know what? You're right.

511
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:52,799
You're right.

512
00:33:52,934 --> 00:33:55,803
<i>Then do as you're told,
Stanley.</i>

513
00:33:55,937 --> 00:33:57,305
No, I understand.

514
00:33:57,437 --> 00:33:59,841
<i>And take this girl
straight to Reno.</i>

515
00:33:59,974 --> 00:34:01,474
Yep.

516
00:34:01,608 --> 00:34:04,644
<i>Stan, listen to me.
This ain't one of Yates's side pieces.</i>

517
00:34:05,478 --> 00:34:07,581
<i>This is family business.</i>

518
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:09,783
<i>Don't get cute.</i>

519
00:34:19,626 --> 00:34:23,030
You have to let me
get away from Yates.

520
00:34:23,164 --> 00:34:26,666
I made a deal,
and I can't get out of it.

521
00:34:28,468 --> 00:34:31,205
I fucked up...
really bad.

522
00:34:31,339 --> 00:34:33,074
And...

523
00:34:34,507 --> 00:34:36,878
And he is bad.

524
00:34:38,612 --> 00:34:40,413
He is a bad man
in his heart.

525
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:43,516
Pack your shit.

526
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,253
We're out of here
in five minutes.

527
00:34:45,385 --> 00:34:47,154
- Stan, why?
- Lion, pack for her.

528
00:34:47,288 --> 00:34:48,488
Where we going now?

529
00:34:48,622 --> 00:34:49,991
I'm sorry I crashed your
car, Stanley.

530
00:34:50,124 --> 00:34:52,425
Pack your shit.
We're not stopping till we get there.

531
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,230
Please! He said he was gonna
kill me if I tried to run away!

532
00:34:56,364 --> 00:34:59,466
If we don't get you to Reno,
he's gonna kill us, so...

533
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,869
Lion, you're not moving.
We gotta move, now.

534
00:35:02,003 --> 00:35:04,972
I have cash! I have loads of it!
You can have all of it.

535
00:35:05,106 --> 00:35:07,975
- Stan, look at her, man. She's pleading with you.
- Please, Stanley, please.

536
00:35:08,109 --> 00:35:10,510
Please take it, please.
Please take it.

537
00:35:10,644 --> 00:35:12,779
Please, just let me go,
please!

538
00:35:12,914 --> 00:35:15,249
Stan, look at her.
She's pleading with you, man.

539
00:35:15,383 --> 00:35:17,919
There's nothing
we can fucking do!

540
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,687
Stan,
look at her.

541
00:35:20,821 --> 00:35:24,424
- Come on. Are we that low?
- Listen to me, Lion.

542
00:35:24,557 --> 00:35:27,295
- Stan.
- I feel for this girl.

543
00:35:27,427 --> 00:35:28,695
I really do.

544
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:30,197
But she fucking
drugged you, man.

545
00:35:30,331 --> 00:35:32,432
It was just
a Xanax.

546
00:35:32,565 --> 00:35:34,534
Saturday night,

547
00:35:34,668 --> 00:35:37,405
we take
what's ours.

548
00:35:37,537 --> 00:35:40,573
The fucking alternative
is that he kills us.

549
00:35:44,946 --> 00:35:47,048
Do you hear
what I'm saying?

550
00:35:48,448 --> 00:35:49,850
Do you trust me?

551
00:35:50,952 --> 00:35:51,953
All right.

552
00:35:52,086 --> 00:35:54,221
Let's get the fuck out of
here, all right?

553
00:36:07,435 --> 00:36:09,937
- How are you?
- Like you give a shit.

554
00:36:10,071 --> 00:36:12,772
I'm trying to be civil.

555
00:36:12,907 --> 00:36:14,408
I wish
I could help you.

556
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:16,844
But Stanley makes
every decision for you.

557
00:36:18,112 --> 00:36:21,182
Well, you lied to me,
you drugged me,

558
00:36:21,315 --> 00:36:23,583
and you smashed
our car, so...

559
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:27,121
Doesn't mean
I don't like you.

560
00:36:31,558 --> 00:36:33,394
Sorry, Clay,

561
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:35,262
your card
was declined.

562
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,199
Oh, fuck.

563
00:36:40,267 --> 00:36:41,869
I don't have 1,400
on me.

564
00:36:42,003 --> 00:36:44,637
Well, you're the one who
needs it by tomorrow.

565
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:50,077
Look, if we don't
get to San Francisco,

566
00:36:50,211 --> 00:36:54,081
we're gonna miss a big business
opportunity for my family.

567
00:36:54,215 --> 00:36:56,117
There's a lot of money
waiting for us there.

568
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,784
Okay.

569
00:36:57,918 --> 00:37:00,921
So, once we get our hands on
it, we can cut you off a check.

570
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:04,358
Call it 1,700
for your trouble?

571
00:37:04,492 --> 00:37:06,793
Yeah, that don't
work for us.

572
00:37:08,362 --> 00:37:09,596
Uh-huh.

573
00:37:13,868 --> 00:37:15,668
Hey, Sky,
how much cash you say you have?

574
00:37:15,803 --> 00:37:17,104
You can't take
my money.

575
00:37:17,238 --> 00:37:21,075
Actually, I can.
Lion, check her purse.

576
00:37:24,045 --> 00:37:25,545
All right.

577
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:28,983
Hey, excuse me.

578
00:37:29,116 --> 00:37:32,520
You know, I didn't see title
or registration in the glove.

579
00:37:32,652 --> 00:37:34,822
Why you looking
in the glove?

580
00:37:35,655 --> 00:37:37,324
Kid, come on.

581
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:40,261
- He's using you.
- Hold the dog.

582
00:37:44,664 --> 00:37:46,200
All right.

583
00:37:47,634 --> 00:37:49,170
What we got here?

584
00:37:56,377 --> 00:37:58,012
Short.

585
00:37:58,145 --> 00:38:01,748
Maybe you shouldn't have
sprung for the Caesar suite, moron.

586
00:38:01,882 --> 00:38:04,651
Maybe you
should shut the fuck up.

587
00:38:06,554 --> 00:38:08,788
Who's "Pam McGinty"?

588
00:38:08,923 --> 00:38:10,723
That card is expired.

589
00:38:14,295 --> 00:38:15,863
Gary, Indiana.

590
00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:23,237
How far is Gary
from here?

591
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,439
<i>Now there is
Morris putting up a spot three.</i>

592
00:38:25,573 --> 00:38:28,775
They're not gonna help us.
This entire thing is pointless.

593
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:30,945
<i>...with no one guarding him.</i>

594
00:38:31,078 --> 00:38:34,115
<i>Now it's Stockton
bringing it down.</i>

595
00:38:46,594 --> 00:38:47,895
Boys...

596
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:50,297
how do you know Mary?

597
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:55,336
We met at church.

598
00:38:55,903 --> 00:38:57,471
At a, uh,
church group.

599
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:01,641
That must have been
a recent development.

600
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:03,776
And what
church is that?

601
00:39:03,911 --> 00:39:06,046
It's called
the Church of All Seasons.

602
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,348
Yeah.

603
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:08,949
Wonderful church.

604
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:12,987
Led by, uh,
Father, um...

605
00:39:13,954 --> 00:39:15,289
Denunzio.

606
00:39:15,422 --> 00:39:17,958
- Father Denunzio.
- Yep.

607
00:39:18,092 --> 00:39:20,194
The Lord is our shepherd.

608
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:25,765
What is it you've
come here for, Mary?

609
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:28,701
It's Sky.

610
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:32,540
My name is Sky.

611
00:39:32,672 --> 00:39:33,908
I don't understand that.

612
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:38,412
Why change such a pretty name
like Mary

613
00:39:38,546 --> 00:39:43,017
to something so stupid
like Sky?

614
00:39:45,819 --> 00:39:47,454
Nevertheless,

615
00:39:47,588 --> 00:39:49,156
perhaps you could answer,
Mary.

616
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:51,959
Your father asked you
a question.

617
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:54,061
I need some more money.

618
00:39:54,195 --> 00:39:55,795
What about
all that money you made

619
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,898
from that place
where you danced?

620
00:39:58,032 --> 00:40:00,267
I didn't come here
to cause any trouble.

621
00:40:02,036 --> 00:40:03,871
I'm trying really hard
to be good.

622
00:40:04,004 --> 00:40:06,273
If we gave you
money again,

623
00:40:06,407 --> 00:40:08,275
what lesson would you
have learned?

624
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:10,411
So, is that a "no"?

625
00:40:10,544 --> 00:40:12,279
Everybody needs a little
help from time to time.

626
00:40:12,413 --> 00:40:13,746
- You can just say no.
- Exactly.

627
00:40:13,881 --> 00:40:15,115
It's brave
to ask for help.

628
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:16,749
- She's being reasonable.
- Reasonable.

629
00:40:16,884 --> 00:40:18,919
I didn't come here
to be a burden.

630
00:40:19,053 --> 00:40:20,421
- I'll get out of your hair.
- Mary!

631
00:40:20,554 --> 00:40:22,523
We talked about this.
We can't have this.

632
00:40:22,656 --> 00:40:26,260
We have to set a hard line. She can't
just come here when she needs money.

633
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:33,867
It's not there.

634
00:40:34,668 --> 00:40:37,471
I moved it
after your last visit.

635
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:38,973
Hey, wait for me.

636
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:42,076
Mary, you'll never outrun
your circumstances

637
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:45,112
if you continue
down this path of sin.

638
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:47,715
Well, you made it look
really easy, Mom,

639
00:40:47,848 --> 00:40:49,817
with your new life
and your new husband.

640
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:53,988
You poison everything you
come into contact with.

641
00:40:54,855 --> 00:40:57,324
But I'm not gonna
let you poison me.

642
00:40:57,992 --> 00:41:00,160
Get out
of my house.

643
00:41:09,036 --> 00:41:11,872
Okay, that's it.
Everyone, get out of my house.

644
00:41:12,006 --> 00:41:13,173
Take your shit
and get out.

645
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:15,276
I want you
out of our home, now.

646
00:41:15,409 --> 00:41:18,078
These men are hustlers, and they
need to leave our house immediately.

647
00:41:18,212 --> 00:41:20,147
- Get out of our home.
- Call the police.

648
00:41:20,281 --> 00:41:22,716
- Don't call the cops.
- Get out.

649
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,451
Get out of here!

650
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:27,554
- We'll be going now. Right, Stan?
- Get out of my house!

651
00:41:41,302 --> 00:41:42,336
Yo.

652
00:41:45,873 --> 00:41:47,141
You all right?

653
00:41:47,274 --> 00:41:48,575
Yeah. Why?

654
00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:54,081
- You sure?
- I'm fine.

655
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:58,919
I know a place
we can sleep tonight.

656
00:42:01,322 --> 00:42:02,790
All right, do it.

657
00:42:02,956 --> 00:42:05,025
- No...
- Fuck!

658
00:42:05,826 --> 00:42:07,795
- Fuck!
- Did it go through?

659
00:42:07,928 --> 00:42:10,064
Do it again, man.
Do it again.

660
00:42:10,197 --> 00:42:13,167
It has to go all the way...

661
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,514
Fuck.

662
00:42:32,453 --> 00:42:34,054
I gotta pee.

663
00:42:34,188 --> 00:42:35,723
Yeah, well, you're not
doing jack shit

664
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:37,558
without one of us
watching you.

665
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:44,031
All right.

666
00:42:44,164 --> 00:42:46,133
Lion, you gotta
eat something.

667
00:42:46,835 --> 00:42:49,403
I'm gonna check out
the cafeteria.

668
00:42:49,536 --> 00:42:50,637
I'll take Ash.

669
00:42:50,771 --> 00:42:54,441
- Hey, don't let her out of your sight.
- All right.

670
00:43:13,994 --> 00:43:16,063
- Can you just go outside?
- No.

671
00:43:16,196 --> 00:43:18,599
- Why not?
- Because I can't.

672
00:43:24,873 --> 00:43:26,507
Make a noise.

673
00:43:40,187 --> 00:43:42,022
Cover your ears.

674
00:43:52,533 --> 00:43:55,669
<i>How much do you get for
winning one of these things?</i>

675
00:43:57,104 --> 00:43:58,639
A big fight?

676
00:43:58,772 --> 00:44:00,707
Couple hundred.

677
00:44:00,842 --> 00:44:04,311
You get your ass beaten
for a couple hundred bucks?

678
00:44:06,046 --> 00:44:07,648
Well, this fight
in San Francisco,

679
00:44:07,781 --> 00:44:09,416
we'd make a lot more.

680
00:44:11,585 --> 00:44:14,054
Why don't you box
with gloves?

681
00:44:14,188 --> 00:44:17,090
Well, we got
our license revoked.

682
00:44:18,425 --> 00:44:20,961
Stan tried
to bribe a ref.

683
00:44:27,768 --> 00:44:31,004
- You're not his possession.
- Yeah, I know.

684
00:44:33,942 --> 00:44:36,109
So, why do you
do it then?

685
00:44:42,951 --> 00:44:45,352
Can't you do
anything else?

686
00:44:49,924 --> 00:44:53,026
Got a business plan to
open up a dry cleaners.

687
00:44:55,696 --> 00:44:58,365
- A dry cleaners?
- Yeah.

688
00:44:58,499 --> 00:45:00,434
Hey, tell me
if this makes sense.

689
00:45:05,405 --> 00:45:07,441
So, Stan likes
his clothes, right?

690
00:45:07,574 --> 00:45:09,142
Yeah, right.

691
00:45:09,276 --> 00:45:12,079
No, he does.
He likes to dress smart.

692
00:45:12,212 --> 00:45:14,481
On fight night,
he really goes to town.

693
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:17,351
And...
it'd be good for him.

694
00:45:17,484 --> 00:45:19,119
Something that he can
put his mind to,

695
00:45:19,253 --> 00:45:20,889
be hyperactive
and productive.

696
00:45:21,021 --> 00:45:24,491
What would happen is, say people
got, like, important events,

697
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:27,127
like, uh, weddings
or baptisms.

698
00:45:27,261 --> 00:45:28,795
So, they need clothes
for it.

699
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,464
Instead of getting
new clothes,

700
00:45:30,597 --> 00:45:33,567
they come to us, and we have
them looking real fucking smart,

701
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,302
like brand-fucking-new.

702
00:45:35,435 --> 00:45:37,271
You see here?
Look, the best part.

703
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:39,072
"Kaminsky Kleaners."

704
00:45:39,206 --> 00:45:40,574
Two Ks.

705
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:43,310
That'll be
the hook.

706
00:45:43,443 --> 00:45:45,445
That's how
you get them.

707
00:45:46,179 --> 00:45:47,714
Kaminsky Kleaners.

708
00:45:49,516 --> 00:45:51,685
That's not asking
for that much.

709
00:45:58,425 --> 00:46:01,061
Well, hopefully,
after this next fight.

710
00:46:02,162 --> 00:46:04,999
I just gotta tell Stanley.

711
00:46:05,132 --> 00:46:07,334
You should stand up
to your brother.

712
00:46:08,168 --> 00:46:09,770
Do what you want
to do.

713
00:46:41,501 --> 00:46:44,204
I was in so many
stupid plays here.

714
00:46:45,606 --> 00:46:47,107
Thought I was really
hot shit.

715
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,243
So I moved to New York
to become a dancer.

716
00:46:53,014 --> 00:46:54,448
And then what?

717
00:46:54,581 --> 00:46:56,617
Well,
I guess I wasn't.

718
00:47:01,288 --> 00:47:03,557
How did you come up
with "Sky"?

719
00:47:04,558 --> 00:47:06,193
I read it
in a book...

720
00:47:09,097 --> 00:47:10,797
and it sounded pretty.

721
00:47:14,068 --> 00:47:15,769
I wanted
to be free.

722
00:47:17,872 --> 00:47:19,907
I met Yates in a club.

723
00:47:21,174 --> 00:47:23,410
Promised me he was
gonna fix everything,

724
00:47:23,543 --> 00:47:27,314
but he turned out to be a
liar, just like everyone else.

725
00:47:29,282 --> 00:47:31,184
I'm the stupid one
though.

726
00:47:32,686 --> 00:47:35,255
Well, I don't think
you're stupid.

727
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:39,626
I wanna dance for you.

728
00:47:41,863 --> 00:47:42,897
Where?

729
00:47:43,031 --> 00:47:44,264
Here.

730
00:47:46,134 --> 00:47:48,036
In the living room?

731
00:47:48,168 --> 00:47:49,937
- Yeah.
- All right.

732
00:48:24,172 --> 00:48:27,741
Ooh!

733
00:48:32,379 --> 00:48:34,414
Ah, you're
killing it, Sky.

734
00:48:44,192 --> 00:48:45,258
Lion!

735
00:48:54,135 --> 00:48:55,535
That's right.

736
00:48:56,636 --> 00:48:59,606
Ooh! Let's clap.
Clap.

737
00:49:00,808 --> 00:49:01,943
Whoo!

738
00:49:12,086 --> 00:49:15,288
Hey, don't stop on account of us.

739
00:49:31,738 --> 00:49:33,908
Better than
my mom's chicken.

740
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:35,675
That's a fact.

741
00:49:36,978 --> 00:49:40,047
All right, I gotta go to bed.

742
00:49:40,181 --> 00:49:42,749
5:30 in the morning,
all right?

743
00:49:44,417 --> 00:49:46,553
Thanks
for the dance.

744
00:49:46,686 --> 00:49:49,322
Anytime.

745
00:49:54,327 --> 00:49:56,429
Sleep tight.

746
00:50:14,882 --> 00:50:17,952
You know, I was worried you
might try to bail tonight.

747
00:50:19,187 --> 00:50:21,055
I'm not gonna
run away again.

748
00:50:23,191 --> 00:50:25,358
I'm sorry
about your family.

749
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:28,595
It's a fucking
rough one.

750
00:50:31,833 --> 00:50:34,367
What, do you want
to be friends now?

751
00:50:38,371 --> 00:50:40,373
I know what you're
trying to do, Sky.

752
00:50:40,507 --> 00:50:42,509
It's not gonna work.

753
00:50:42,642 --> 00:50:47,547
Me and him,
we're this close to our dream.

754
00:50:48,448 --> 00:50:49,817
I'm not gonna let you
or anyone else...

755
00:50:49,951 --> 00:50:51,819
- You don't know who I am.
- I know Yates.

756
00:50:51,953 --> 00:50:53,955
You don't know
why I do what I do.

757
00:50:55,857 --> 00:50:57,325
Look, Sky...

758
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,030
I just can't let that kid
wake up at 40

759
00:51:03,164 --> 00:51:06,267
and wonder why he didn't do
what he was supposed to do

760
00:51:06,399 --> 00:51:08,702
when he had
the chance.

761
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:14,075
That kid is better at
fighting than I ever been

762
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:16,143
at anything
in my life.

763
00:51:17,812 --> 00:51:19,247
I'm not trying
to be a dick,

764
00:51:19,379 --> 00:51:21,082
but probably
you too.

765
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:26,888
I mean,
he's special.

766
00:51:28,956 --> 00:51:31,524
And I'll never know
what that's like.

767
00:51:37,664 --> 00:51:40,234
The problem with
California is the taxes.

768
00:51:40,368 --> 00:51:41,601
Fuck it.

769
00:51:42,469 --> 00:51:43,804
After this fight,

770
00:51:43,938 --> 00:51:46,841
once we get this money,
we're gonna keep it.

771
00:51:46,974 --> 00:51:51,078
We'll be rolling in silk.
Monogrammed, perfect.

772
00:51:51,846 --> 00:51:54,215
We're gonna get us
a good two-bedroom.

773
00:51:54,348 --> 00:51:56,183
With a lease.
It's ours.

774
00:51:56,317 --> 00:51:59,186
And no one comes in that
place but you and me.

775
00:52:00,321 --> 00:52:02,656
There'll be
steak and wine.

776
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:04,557
Steak
every morning.

777
00:52:06,493 --> 00:52:08,029
That's it. Let's go.

778
00:52:08,162 --> 00:52:09,830
Come on, faster!

779
00:52:10,563 --> 00:52:12,133
So,
turns out Gary

780
00:52:12,266 --> 00:52:13,633
didn't quite
work out for us.

781
00:52:13,767 --> 00:52:16,436
Well, there's nothing I
can do about that, sir.

782
00:52:16,569 --> 00:52:17,838
Come on, man.

783
00:52:17,972 --> 00:52:20,740
I'm sure there's
something we can do.

784
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:24,378
Tell you what...
1,400, you get your truck back.

785
00:52:27,647 --> 00:52:30,418
I got
a crazy idea.

786
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:31,919
How about
we fight for it?

787
00:52:32,053 --> 00:52:33,387
What's up?

788
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,057
We lose, you keep the car.
We win, you do the work for free.

789
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:38,993
My guy against world's
strongest man over here.

790
00:52:39,126 --> 00:52:41,329
- What you think?
- I'm good with that.

791
00:52:41,461 --> 00:52:42,662
Dude, no.

792
00:52:42,796 --> 00:52:44,298
No. Look,
this is a business.

793
00:52:44,432 --> 00:52:45,765
You need to get out
of here with that.

794
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,301
I'm talking business. All right?

795
00:52:47,435 --> 00:52:49,236
As a businessman,
you should appreciate these odds.

796
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:52,605
I mean, look at the size of this guy.
He's yoked.

797
00:52:53,874 --> 00:52:56,243
Just talk it over.
All right?

798
00:52:57,477 --> 00:52:59,679
Here's what's going on.
I don't want that...

799
00:52:59,814 --> 00:53:01,748
What the fuck,
Stan?

800
00:53:01,882 --> 00:53:03,783
I need you to step
up for the family.

801
00:53:03,918 --> 00:53:05,152
I'm recovering,
man.

802
00:53:05,286 --> 00:53:07,054
Come on, man.
You can knock this guy out.

803
00:53:07,188 --> 00:53:08,055
You knock him out.

804
00:53:08,189 --> 00:53:09,957
Hey, I'm cleaning up
your mess here.

805
00:53:10,091 --> 00:53:11,491
It's not his mess.
It's yours.

806
00:53:11,624 --> 00:53:13,493
Actually, it's yours.
So you wanna butt out?

807
00:53:13,626 --> 00:53:15,595
Look, no deal.

808
00:53:15,729 --> 00:53:18,232
You get your truck back
when we get the money.

809
00:53:22,236 --> 00:53:24,637
Guess we're gonna have to deal
with this a different way.

810
00:53:24,771 --> 00:53:28,708
Jesus. Stan, don't fucking do that, man.
What's wrong with you? You stupid?

811
00:53:28,843 --> 00:53:30,311
- What's the matter with you?
- Wise up.

812
00:53:30,444 --> 00:53:33,114
- What's the matter?
- Keep your shit tucked in. I got this.

813
00:53:33,247 --> 00:53:35,282
- I'm tucked.
- Keep your shit tucked in. I need to know.

814
00:53:35,416 --> 00:53:38,752
Oh, well, you were in retirement a second
ago. Now you're gonna do something?

815
00:53:38,886 --> 00:53:40,653
- ...come into the fucking shop.
- I get it.

816
00:53:40,787 --> 00:53:43,124
- How about two against one?
- What?

817
00:53:43,257 --> 00:53:45,759
- Two against one, for the car.
- Two what?

818
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:48,329
Him and any one of these
guys, apart from him.

819
00:53:48,462 --> 00:53:49,830
- In a fight?
- Yeah.

820
00:53:49,964 --> 00:53:51,832
- Come on, man.
- You seem like honest guys.

821
00:53:51,966 --> 00:53:54,435
- Clean for the car. Clean fight. No stupid shit.
- No way!

822
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:56,137
- No!
- Fellas, I got this.

823
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:59,606
- I got this for sure.
- Stanley, you can't let him do that!

824
00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:01,674
We fight and whoever
wins, we settle it, yeah?

825
00:54:01,809 --> 00:54:03,576
This is
an unfair situation.

826
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:04,644
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

827
00:54:04,778 --> 00:54:06,180
Come on.
All right.

828
00:54:06,313 --> 00:54:08,115
This kid's made up his mind.
There's nothing you can do.

829
00:54:08,249 --> 00:54:11,252
- Come on. Let's go!
- Go ahead, let's go.

830
00:54:14,321 --> 00:54:16,023
If I win,
I'm hanging on to the money.

831
00:54:16,157 --> 00:54:17,590
- No problem.
- And whatever happens,

832
00:54:17,724 --> 00:54:19,460
- keep that thing out of it.
- You got this.

833
00:54:19,592 --> 00:54:21,295
All right,
no scratching the eyes.

834
00:54:21,429 --> 00:54:22,830
No balls, no biting.

835
00:54:22,963 --> 00:54:25,066
Just clean, all right?
Respectable.

836
00:54:31,038 --> 00:54:32,139
Get up!

837
00:54:32,273 --> 00:54:33,307
Get up!

838
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:37,710
Get up!

839
00:54:38,711 --> 00:54:41,382
Get up! Get up! Get up!

840
00:54:41,515 --> 00:54:42,550
- You done?
- Yeah.

841
00:54:42,682 --> 00:54:43,818
- We done?
- Oh, yeah.

842
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:45,453
You're done,
man.

843
00:54:49,857 --> 00:54:51,525
Yes!

844
00:54:51,658 --> 00:54:53,394
Yes, that's right! Come on.

845
00:54:53,527 --> 00:54:56,596
Pay up.
Give me the keys.

846
00:54:56,729 --> 00:54:58,899
Come on. Give me
the fucking keys.

847
00:56:12,973 --> 00:56:15,409
- Could I get a cup of coffee?
- Sure.

848
00:56:20,281 --> 00:56:21,916
Last supper.

849
00:56:27,054 --> 00:56:29,023
Anyone gonna
say anything?

850
00:56:30,723 --> 00:56:32,792
Dad, look,
a whippet!

851
00:56:32,927 --> 00:56:34,828
Sorry for that.

852
00:56:34,962 --> 00:56:36,729
We've always wanted
one of these guys.

853
00:56:36,864 --> 00:56:39,867
His favorite book to read before
bedtime is <i>Wiley the Whippet.</i>

854
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,635
You guys read that one?
It's great.

855
00:56:41,768 --> 00:56:43,070
Is he friendly?

856
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:46,040
Not really,
dude.

857
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,375
Jesus.

858
00:56:48,509 --> 00:56:51,912
I feel like we're in the
fucking Wookiee bar. Am I right?

859
00:56:52,046 --> 00:56:53,881
Stan,
we can't do this, man.

860
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:57,418
Can't do what?

861
00:56:58,586 --> 00:56:59,920
Take her to Yates.

862
00:57:00,054 --> 00:57:02,656
Been through this, kid.
It's out of the question.

863
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:04,024
Let's take her
to San Francisco.

864
00:57:04,158 --> 00:57:07,194
He knows where we're going.
All right?

865
00:57:07,328 --> 00:57:08,662
He will find us.

866
00:57:08,795 --> 00:57:11,966
Why don't we just bail and go
somewhere else? Fuck the fight.

867
00:57:13,701 --> 00:57:17,905
Why do you keep
making it like we got options?

868
00:57:18,672 --> 00:57:20,207
Like we got
all these sweet deals

869
00:57:20,341 --> 00:57:22,610
and people looking
to hook us up? We don't.

870
00:57:22,742 --> 00:57:24,478
We... We got options.

871
00:57:24,612 --> 00:57:26,779
We got one option.

872
00:57:26,914 --> 00:57:27,881
All right?

873
00:57:28,015 --> 00:57:30,384
We fight, that's it.

874
00:57:30,517 --> 00:57:32,152
I fight.

875
00:57:33,753 --> 00:57:35,122
That's right.

876
00:57:35,256 --> 00:57:37,825
You fight, and I'm the
business end of this company.

877
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:39,293
Company?
What company?

878
00:57:39,426 --> 00:57:42,096
We're not a company, man.
We don't have a front door.

879
00:57:42,896 --> 00:57:45,132
To have a company,
you need a front door.

880
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:48,801
All you do is...

881
00:57:50,804 --> 00:57:52,273
What?

882
00:57:55,775 --> 00:57:57,378
All I do is what?

883
00:57:58,879 --> 00:58:00,314
Cling on.

884
00:58:01,282 --> 00:58:02,850
And ruin shit.

885
00:58:11,492 --> 00:58:12,593
Sky tell you that?

886
00:58:12,726 --> 00:58:14,828
Don't make this about her.
I can think for myself.

887
00:58:14,962 --> 00:58:16,530
Then say that again.

888
00:58:16,664 --> 00:58:19,066
I dare you. Look me in the
eyes and say that again.

889
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:21,368
'Cause I know
it takes you a minute.

890
00:58:25,439 --> 00:58:29,209
You use me and my talents
and what I'm good at.

891
00:58:30,044 --> 00:58:31,979
Everybody knows it.

892
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,581
Oh, really?

893
00:58:34,715 --> 00:58:37,117
Everyone knows it,
huh?

894
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:39,887
That's something.

895
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,388
You're really something.

896
00:58:42,156 --> 00:58:44,792
You can't do anything
without me.

897
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:46,794
I do everything.

898
00:58:46,927 --> 00:58:49,830
You got one talent. One.

899
00:58:49,963 --> 00:58:51,398
And that's your fists.

900
00:58:51,532 --> 00:58:53,767
I got things happening, all right?
I got shit going on.

901
00:58:53,901 --> 00:58:55,569
Oh, what you got?
You got some things?

902
00:58:55,703 --> 00:58:56,770
I got ideas.

903
00:58:56,904 --> 00:58:59,106
What, your dry-cleaning
business?

904
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:00,374
Yeah.

905
00:59:02,476 --> 00:59:05,679
You can't do shit
like that, man.

906
00:59:05,814 --> 00:59:07,047
'Cause you're not smart.

907
00:59:07,181 --> 00:59:09,016
And what's
your plan, man?

908
00:59:09,149 --> 00:59:13,754
You think we're gonna get, like, a small
business loan? Is that what you think?

909
00:59:13,887 --> 00:59:15,789
That we're gonna use
our good credit

910
00:59:15,923 --> 00:59:18,926
to get a fine deal
on some retail space?

911
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:22,763
Get one of those fucking machines that
swirl around so you can find your pants?

912
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:25,032
Shh. Shh.

913
00:59:25,165 --> 00:59:27,768
I mean, what are we talking
about here? I use you?

914
00:59:27,901 --> 00:59:29,603
- What the fuck, man?
- Keep it down.

915
00:59:29,737 --> 00:59:31,605
- People are staring at us.
- I use you?

916
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:33,540
Are you crazy?

917
00:59:33,674 --> 00:59:36,744
Hey, partner, it's
a family restaurant, man.

918
00:59:36,877 --> 00:59:39,814
Oh, then why don't you eat your
pizza with your fucking family?

919
00:59:39,947 --> 00:59:41,582
Stanley,
shut up.

920
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:44,218
Unbelievable.

921
00:59:45,386 --> 00:59:46,887
I make sure
your hair's cut.

922
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:49,056
I teach you
about fashion.

923
00:59:49,189 --> 00:59:51,892
I sleep on the hard floor
so you always got a bed.

924
00:59:52,025 --> 00:59:54,094
I skip meals so that
you're never hungry.

925
00:59:54,228 --> 00:59:56,397
And what do you do?

926
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:57,866
What do you do?

927
00:59:57,998 --> 01:00:01,268
Nothing. What do you say?
Nothing. Ever.

928
01:00:01,402 --> 01:00:04,171
Do you know why?
Because it never occurred to you

929
01:00:04,304 --> 01:00:05,874
to have any gratitude
for the person

930
01:00:06,006 --> 01:00:07,674
who's given you
everything!

931
01:00:09,243 --> 01:00:12,980
I give you everything!
I ask for nothing in return!

932
01:00:13,113 --> 01:00:15,048
And it's a good job
because I don't get it!

933
01:00:15,182 --> 01:00:16,283
You're scaring the dog.

934
01:00:16,417 --> 01:00:17,518
You think I like
living like this?

935
01:00:17,651 --> 01:00:20,053
You think I like
having no possessions?

936
01:00:20,187 --> 01:00:23,624
I mean, I know I look like I got
it all covered, but I'm tired, man.

937
01:00:23,757 --> 01:00:26,895
Hang on, hang on. How many 25 year
olds you know got arthritis, huh?

938
01:00:28,662 --> 01:00:30,531
- I got fingers that don't bend.
- There's a dog there.

939
01:00:30,664 --> 01:00:32,232
I forget shit
that happened yesterday

940
01:00:32,366 --> 01:00:34,134
because my brain
don't fucking work.

941
01:00:34,268 --> 01:00:35,803
You think your
life's hard, Stan?

942
01:00:35,936 --> 01:00:38,305
Shit, I'd be a professional
boxer now if it wasn't for you.

943
01:00:38,439 --> 01:00:40,240
You are
a professional boxer.

944
01:00:40,374 --> 01:00:42,176
No, I'm not. I fight guys
two-on-one in parking lots

945
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:43,912
so you don't
get another felony.

946
01:00:44,044 --> 01:00:47,314
I'm supposed to protect my fucking hands, Stan.

947
01:00:47,448 --> 01:00:48,949
I'm supposed
to protect my hands.

948
01:00:49,082 --> 01:00:50,885
You got me a job at a
fucking sewing factory.

949
01:00:51,018 --> 01:00:53,253
- Can you please quiet your dog?
- We're a joke.

950
01:00:53,387 --> 01:00:55,122
We're a fucking joke.

951
01:00:55,255 --> 01:00:56,790
If you don't
get that dog out of here,

952
01:00:56,925 --> 01:00:59,894
- I'm gonna call the police.
- I'm sorry. Quiet, Ash.

953
01:01:00,027 --> 01:01:02,529
- I love you.
- Good boy. Come on.

954
01:01:02,663 --> 01:01:03,730
She doesn't love you.

955
01:01:03,865 --> 01:01:05,032
Good boy.

956
01:01:05,165 --> 01:01:06,200
Can't you see that?

957
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:08,469
She's turning you
against me, man.

958
01:01:08,602 --> 01:01:11,672
- Dolores, call the cops.
- He's a service animal

959
01:01:11,806 --> 01:01:14,274
with fucking
documentation!

960
01:01:19,112 --> 01:01:22,817
- Get him out of here.
- Totally inappropriate.

961
01:01:22,951 --> 01:01:24,017
All right,
I'm sorry.

962
01:01:24,151 --> 01:01:27,020
Dolores, please,
don't call the cops.

963
01:01:27,154 --> 01:01:29,858
I'll get his papers from the car.
All right?

964
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:31,458
In fact, better,
we'll leave.

965
01:01:31,592 --> 01:01:33,360
- Thank you!
- We'll take that to go.

966
01:01:33,494 --> 01:01:34,963
- Good.
- All right.

967
01:01:35,095 --> 01:01:37,197
Outside, you two, now.

968
01:01:39,901 --> 01:01:42,336
Oh, no. No.

969
01:01:45,974 --> 01:01:47,341
Fuck me.

970
01:01:47,474 --> 01:01:49,109
All right,
they're towing the car!

971
01:01:49,243 --> 01:01:51,111
- We gotta go!
- Walter, sit down.

972
01:01:51,245 --> 01:01:52,746
Come on!

973
01:01:52,881 --> 01:01:54,314
Get the fuck
out of my way.

974
01:01:54,448 --> 01:01:56,283
- I said it's a family restaurant!
- They're towing my car!

975
01:02:02,924 --> 01:02:04,558
Take this,
meet me out back.

976
01:02:04,691 --> 01:02:06,260
Hey, here.

977
01:02:10,664 --> 01:02:11,765
Right.

978
01:02:12,867 --> 01:02:14,201
Stolen.

979
01:02:14,334 --> 01:02:16,637
It's registered
in Massachusetts.

980
01:02:19,506 --> 01:02:20,240
Call it in?

981
01:02:20,374 --> 01:02:22,209
Yeah,
I just called.

982
01:02:31,785 --> 01:02:32,719
Fuck!

983
01:02:36,189 --> 01:02:37,859
Where's the money?

984
01:02:37,992 --> 01:02:40,627
Tell me you didn't leave
the money in the car.

985
01:03:15,095 --> 01:03:17,264
I'm gonna take Ash
for a walk.

986
01:03:27,274 --> 01:03:30,812
- I'm proud of you.
- For what?

987
01:03:31,612 --> 01:03:33,614
For standing up
to him.

988
01:03:47,461 --> 01:03:49,696
There's a 7:20 to Reno.

989
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:54,068
All right.

990
01:03:54,201 --> 01:03:56,770
- They know we're coming.
- Where's Ash?

991
01:03:57,604 --> 01:03:58,940
What did you do
with Ash?

992
01:03:59,073 --> 01:04:00,707
Come on, let's go.

993
01:04:07,547 --> 01:04:08,850
What did you
fucking do?

994
01:04:08,983 --> 01:04:10,183
- Lion.
- Huh?

995
01:04:10,317 --> 01:04:11,451
What did you do?

996
01:04:11,585 --> 01:04:13,087
- We needed the money.
- Huh? Huh?

997
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:15,890
- Lion...
- What? What fucking money?

998
01:04:16,024 --> 01:04:17,224
- You sold him?
- I loved him.

999
01:04:17,357 --> 01:04:18,993
- You sold my fucking dog?
- I loved him too.

1000
01:04:19,127 --> 01:04:20,527
You sold
my fucking dog?

1001
01:04:20,661 --> 01:04:21,996
He was my dog too!

1002
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:24,932
- He was my dog too! Lion, stop!
- Give me the money.

I care about you,
Sky.

1031
01:07:06,593 --> 01:07:08,162
I don't think you
deserve half this shit

1032
01:07:08,296 --> 01:07:09,362
you're going through
right now.

1033
01:07:09,496 --> 01:07:11,498
I think you deserve
a lot better.

1034
01:07:11,631 --> 01:07:13,733
The way I feel right now is
I want to go to the booth,

1035
01:07:13,868 --> 01:07:16,436
pick a place,
buy a ticket, and go.

1036
01:07:17,872 --> 01:07:19,606
So, let's go pick a
place and go somewhere.

1037
01:07:19,739 --> 01:07:21,474
We could go anywhere.
Where do you want to go?

1038
01:07:21,608 --> 01:07:23,144
Pick a place.

1039
01:07:23,277 --> 01:07:26,780
Do you like dry-cleaning?
You want to come dry-clean with me?

1040
01:07:26,914 --> 01:07:28,515
Let's go do that.

1041
01:07:28,648 --> 01:07:30,952
- What do you wanna do? We could...
- Lion.

1042
01:07:31,085 --> 01:07:32,586
What?

1043
01:07:34,322 --> 01:07:36,224
Shut up.

1044
01:07:48,802 --> 01:07:50,537
Oh, shit.

1045
01:07:54,175 --> 01:07:55,943
- Don't worry.
- Huh?

1046
01:07:56,077 --> 01:07:57,410
Don't worry.

1047
01:07:57,544 --> 01:07:59,579
It's fine.

1048
01:08:01,315 --> 01:08:02,917
It's fine.

1049
01:08:10,523 --> 01:08:12,860

1050
01:08:12,994 --> 01:08:15,897
Shh. Shh.

1051
01:08:16,696 --> 01:08:18,732
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

1052
01:08:24,805 --> 01:08:27,808
Fifteen dollars in cash,

1053
01:08:27,942 --> 01:08:30,978
an expired
driver's license,

1054
01:08:31,112 --> 01:08:32,113
uh...

1055
01:08:32,246 --> 01:08:36,117
...another man's
credit card.

1056
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:37,617
Oh.

1057
01:08:37,751 --> 01:08:40,620
Now what do we have here?

1058
01:08:40,754 --> 01:08:46,760
Is this the big stud
who stole my mama?

1059
01:08:50,932 --> 01:08:54,001
Count to a hundred
before you leave

1060
01:08:54,135 --> 01:08:57,138
so the bartender
doesn't get suspicious.

1061
01:08:58,873 --> 01:09:01,541
He was giving me
weird looks.

1062
01:09:06,247 --> 01:09:07,949
Is it Yates's?

1063
01:09:14,121 --> 01:09:15,622
It's mine.

1064
01:09:24,966 --> 01:09:27,168
We didn't touch her.

1065
01:09:28,336 --> 01:09:34,008
Milos, uh, unmuzzle our friend, please.

1066
01:10:01,135 --> 01:10:03,004
I swear to God...

1067
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:05,672
we didn't touch her.

1068
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:10,044
She took my brother,
and she fucking ran.

1069
01:10:12,346 --> 01:10:15,182
That feels like
an untruth.

1070
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:18,986
I don't know anything.

1071
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:23,157
Pepper, he didn't tell
us the whole story.

1072
01:10:42,776 --> 01:10:45,246
A girl told me to
give this to you.

1073
01:11:25,052 --> 01:11:28,389

<i>Mr. Feldstein,
please return to the information desk.</i>

1076
01:12:09,964 --> 01:12:12,632
The thing is,
Stanley,

1077
01:12:12,765 --> 01:12:15,302
there's only so much

1078
01:12:15,436 --> 01:12:17,304
money can do
for a man.

1079
01:12:17,438 --> 01:12:18,939
I mean,
look around.

1080
01:12:19,073 --> 01:12:21,674
I own a successful
chain of pet stores.

1081
01:12:21,809 --> 01:12:24,612
I move women
through 19 states.

1082
01:12:24,744 --> 01:12:27,882
I'm a successful
businessman.

1083
01:12:28,015 --> 01:12:30,117
<i>But I've come
to the conclusion</i>

1084
01:12:30,251 --> 01:12:33,287
<i>that possessions
don't matter.</i>

1085
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:36,756
A house isn't a home

1086
01:12:36,891 --> 01:12:40,294
unless you have someone
to share it with.

1087
01:12:41,929 --> 01:12:43,864
And in my heart...

1088
01:12:44,965 --> 01:12:47,201
I think I might be...

1089
01:12:48,602 --> 01:12:50,703
a family man.

1090
01:12:56,844 --> 01:12:58,778
Nobody lives forever.

1091
01:12:58,913 --> 01:13:00,014
Lord knows I'm trying.

1092
01:13:00,147 --> 01:13:04,585
I take 37 vitamins a day.
Christ.

1093
01:13:04,717 --> 01:13:06,921
I haven't pissed yellow
in ten years.

1094
01:13:07,054 --> 01:13:10,324
You have any idea how...
how difficult it is

1095
01:13:10,457 --> 01:13:12,893
for a man my age
to produce

1096
01:13:13,027 --> 01:13:15,629
a viable sperm specimen?

1097
01:13:15,762 --> 01:13:19,967
Oh, Lord, my cock
barely even works anymore.

1098
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,036
I had to use
one of those machines

1099
01:13:22,169 --> 01:13:24,438
like they use
to milk cows.

1100
01:13:24,572 --> 01:13:26,073
But it did the trick.

1101
01:13:26,207 --> 01:13:30,044
And I finally
found my vessel.

1102
01:13:31,645 --> 01:13:33,780
You mean Sky?

1103
01:13:35,282 --> 01:13:36,684
Yes, Sky.

1104
01:13:36,817 --> 01:13:38,785
Fuck! Fuck.

1105
01:13:38,919 --> 01:13:41,255
Fucking hell!

1106
01:13:42,089 --> 01:13:44,291
We had an arrangement.

1107
01:13:44,425 --> 01:13:46,227
We made a deal.

1108
01:13:47,394 --> 01:13:48,829
No!

1109
01:13:52,499 --> 01:13:56,370
I'm not sure
what Pepper told you.

1110
01:13:56,503 --> 01:14:00,941
- And guess what. It's a boy.
- I don't know anything.

1111
01:14:01,075 --> 01:14:04,044
- I would never lie to you.
- All right, go. Go.

1112
01:14:04,178 --> 01:14:06,380
You're not important
anymore, Stanley.

1113
01:14:06,513 --> 01:14:11,218
So, tell me where Sky is,
or I'm gonna eat your fucking heart.

1114
01:14:11,352 --> 01:14:13,187
You understand?

1115
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:16,423
We're talking
about my legacy here.

1116
01:14:17,324 --> 01:14:19,159
I don't understand
what's happening.

1117
01:14:19,293 --> 01:14:22,663
Sky belongs to me.

1118
01:14:22,795 --> 01:14:24,965
Shit!

1119
01:14:25,099 --> 01:14:27,668
Easy now!

1120
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,737
Easy... Easy, tiger.

1121
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:31,572
Now,
just take it easy.

1122
01:14:31,705 --> 01:14:34,208
I think we can
negotiate here.

1123
01:14:40,114 --> 01:14:41,515
All right,
give me the knife.

1124
01:14:42,249 --> 01:14:43,350
Knife.

1125
01:14:45,019 --> 01:14:46,620
Let me put it
to you like this.

1126
01:14:46,754 --> 01:14:48,555
Sky's gone.

1127
01:14:48,689 --> 01:14:49,957
She ain't ever
coming back.

1128
01:14:50,090 --> 01:14:53,360
She got her
hooks into you too, eh?

1129
01:14:53,494 --> 01:14:55,996
When you see her,
don't forget to tell her

1130
01:14:56,130 --> 01:14:58,899
that boy she's carrying
belongs to me.

1131
01:14:59,033 --> 01:15:03,837
And I don't give a damn if I have to
cut that baby out of her belly myself.

1132
01:15:03,971 --> 01:15:07,875
Sky will never live to
hold my boy in her arms.

1133
01:15:58,827 --> 01:16:02,463
<i>All aboard,
407 to Emeryville. Last call.</i>

1134
01:16:23,784 --> 01:16:25,319
You all right?

1135
01:16:30,825 --> 01:16:32,626
Look, we don't have
to do this.

1136
01:16:34,261 --> 01:16:37,564
We can just fucking bail right
now, start fresh.

1137
01:16:38,332 --> 01:16:40,901
We done it
a thousand times before.

1138
01:16:41,034 --> 01:16:43,036
Let's just get
the fuck out of here.

1139
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:46,039
Go somewhere where
no one knows us.

1140
01:16:46,173 --> 01:16:48,008
No, we're fighting.

1141
01:16:51,512 --> 01:16:53,247
We're fighting.

1142
01:18:14,127 --> 01:18:15,796
Why you not talking?

1143
01:18:26,473 --> 01:18:27,207
I'm sorry.

1144
01:18:27,341 --> 01:18:29,176
Just stop, man.
Stop it.

1145
01:18:29,309 --> 01:18:31,678
A-Anything I ever did
that hurt you, all right...

1146
01:18:31,813 --> 01:18:34,515
Stop, stop, stop. Stop, man.
Stop. Let me focus.

1147
01:18:34,648 --> 01:18:36,517
You're special.

1148
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:40,454
And you're the greatest
fucking thing I ever saw.

1149
01:18:41,956 --> 01:18:44,725
Nothing bad's ever gonna
happen to you again.

1150
01:18:51,231 --> 01:18:52,834
I'll protect you,
no matter what.

1151
01:19:20,794 --> 01:19:22,629
All right.

1152
01:19:35,309 --> 01:19:37,544
- How you feeling?
- Like shit.

1153
01:19:37,678 --> 01:19:42,016
Out of shape,
unprepared... shit.

1154
01:19:42,149 --> 01:19:44,318
<i>Kaminsky, one minute.</i>

1155
01:19:47,021 --> 01:19:50,190
All right.
This is it. Showtime.

1156
01:19:56,129 --> 01:19:58,298
- Here, check this out.
- What?

1157
01:19:58,432 --> 01:20:01,234
Where the fuck did you get that?
Huh?

1158
01:20:01,368 --> 01:20:04,504
- <i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Jungleland.</i>
- Sky made it.

1159
01:20:04,638 --> 01:20:06,808
- <i>In our second undercard of the night...</i>
- It's beautiful.

1160
01:20:06,941 --> 01:20:11,778
- <i>...with a purse of $100,000, we have in the red corner...</i>
- I mean, that's a work of art.

1161
01:20:11,913 --> 01:20:13,982
She's got some
real talent.

1162
01:20:14,114 --> 01:20:18,920
- <i>With a record of 23, 2 and 1, Giomo!</i>
- You look like a fucking prince.

1163
01:20:19,053 --> 01:20:20,621
Like a king.

1164
01:20:20,754 --> 01:20:23,557
<i>In the blue corner,
from Fall River, Massachusetts,</i>

1165
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:27,028
<i>in his first professional
fight on the circuit,</i>

1166
01:20:27,194 --> 01:20:30,263
<i>Walter "Lion" Kaminsky!</i>

1167
01:20:44,078 --> 01:20:46,346
Coach. How you doing?

1168
01:20:51,652 --> 01:20:52,954
Gentlemen,
welcome to Jungleland.

1169
01:20:53,087 --> 01:20:55,389
Are we ready for this today?
Good clean fight.

1170
01:20:55,522 --> 01:20:57,125
This is good here.
This is good here.

1171
01:20:57,257 --> 01:21:00,260
Anything below that
is low. Got it?

1172
01:21:00,394 --> 01:21:02,229
Touch gloves. I want you
out on the bell.

1173
01:21:19,379 --> 01:21:22,182
Red corner ready?
Blue corner ready?

1174
01:21:23,183 --> 01:21:24,118
Fight.

1175
01:21:30,757 --> 01:21:33,326
Try to get on the inside.
Then outwork him, right.

1176
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:34,829
You're faster than him.

1177
01:21:39,433 --> 01:21:41,568
Hey, ref, what the fuck?

1178
01:21:41,702 --> 01:21:43,336
What the fuck
was that?

1179
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:45,272
- You all right?
- Yeah, back of the head, ref.

1180
01:21:45,405 --> 01:21:47,407
Ref,
you gonna call that?

1181
01:21:47,541 --> 01:21:48,943
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1182
01:21:49,077 --> 01:21:50,210
Let's fight.
Come on.

1183
01:21:50,343 --> 01:21:51,846
What, you got fucking
money on this guy?

1184
01:21:57,151 --> 01:21:59,319
Guy's a fucking machine.

1185
01:22:00,922 --> 01:22:02,689
Stay out
of the corner!

1186
01:22:05,292 --> 01:22:07,360
Get out of the...

1187
01:22:08,996 --> 01:22:11,565
Okay.
You're all right.

1188
01:22:23,811 --> 01:22:26,546
- Stick to the move. All right?
- Two.

1189
01:22:28,816 --> 01:22:30,818
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good. Yeah, yeah.

1190
01:22:36,590 --> 01:22:38,792
No,
get out of the...

1191
01:22:38,926 --> 01:22:41,062
Hey, out of the corner!

1192
01:22:41,195 --> 01:22:43,563
Don't fucking trade
with him!

1193
01:22:43,697 --> 01:22:45,900
Break. Break.

1194
01:23:17,265 --> 01:23:18,232
Lion!

1195
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:22,937
Lion!
Lion, can you hear me?

1196
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:25,405
Lion, open your eyes!

1197
01:23:25,539 --> 01:23:28,242
- Lion! Stay down.
- Two.

1198
01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:30,111
Just stay down,
all right?

1199
01:23:30,244 --> 01:23:31,478
Three.

1200
01:23:31,611 --> 01:23:34,248
You don't have to do this.
You already won!

1201
01:23:34,381 --> 01:23:35,817
- Four.
- You can throw this.

1202
01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:38,152
- We'll do something else like we always do.
- Five.

1203
01:23:42,322 --> 01:23:43,790
Six.

1204
01:23:45,692 --> 01:23:48,196
- Just stay down, all right?
- Seven.

1205
01:23:48,328 --> 01:23:50,363
Just let me call it.

1206
01:23:50,497 --> 01:23:51,798
- Eight.
- I love you.

1207
01:23:54,035 --> 01:23:56,204
Nine.

1208
01:24:00,274 --> 01:24:01,741
Lion.

1209
01:24:11,853 --> 01:24:15,156
You all right?
If I see something, I'm stopping it.

1210
01:24:16,023 --> 01:24:18,625
Yeah! Come on! Yes!

1211
01:24:18,758 --> 01:24:22,395
Beautiful, Lion!
Beautiful!

1212
01:24:33,908 --> 01:24:35,009
Fight.

1213
01:24:53,261 --> 01:24:54,561
I'm Stan Kaminsky.

1214
01:24:54,694 --> 01:24:56,130
I believe you're
looking for me.

1215
01:24:59,766 --> 01:25:01,168
You're under arrest.

1216
01:25:08,775 --> 01:25:09,877
Yeah!

1217
01:25:18,319 --> 01:25:19,552
Stan?

1218
01:25:22,256 --> 01:25:23,590
Where's Stan?

1219
01:25:26,894 --> 01:25:28,262
Where's my brother?

1220
01:25:40,875 --> 01:25:43,911
Lion! Lion!

1221
01:25:44,045 --> 01:25:45,346
Yes!

1222
01:25:45,478 --> 01:25:47,514
Yeah!

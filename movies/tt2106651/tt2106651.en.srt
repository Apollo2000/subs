00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,967
Dagger Team 1, copy. I keep losing you.

3
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,633
<i>- How long till my backup's here?
- Working on it. Stand by.</i>

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,700
[explosion, then rumbling]

5
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,867
<i>Say eight to ten minutes.
Advise you stay put.</i>

6
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,633
I can't wait for backup.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,100
Send them in behind me.

8
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,267
<i>Davis, maintain your position.
They're on their way.</i>

00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:56,633
[tinkling]

00:02:16,967 --> 00:02:18,633
[whirring]

12
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,133
Dagger Team 1, you seeing this?
There's some kind of disturbance here.

13
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,233
<i>Davis, what is that? What are you seeing?</i>

14
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:46,600
What the hell?

15
00:02:57,167 --> 00:02:58,167
<i>Davis.</i>

16
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,967
<i>Davis, what's your status?</i>

17
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:02,600
[radio static]

18
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,267
<i>Davis, come in!</i>

19
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:05,900
[whirring]

20
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,167
[man] Got you.

21
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,333
{\an8}[man 1]... gonna get a late start.

22
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,280
{\an8}[man 2]
Right, well, it's a closed session.

23
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,667
[woman]
Most of the specs stayed the same...

24
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:49,600
<i>[man over PA]
Dr. Osbourne, call 204. Dr. Osbourne, 204.</i>

25
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,033
{\an8}[indistinct chattering]

26
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:55,967
{\an8}[man 1] They're issuing temporaries
for that R and D, as far as I know.

27
00:04:56,033 --> 00:04:57,833
[man 2]
Is that part of the same badge or...?

28
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,900
[man 3] I'm pretty sure.

29
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:00,100
- [man 2] All right.
- [man 4] How's it going?

30
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,333
- [man 5] Hey.
- [man 6] Hi.

31
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,900
- [man 7] We'll get everything.
- [man 8] Marty was already in?

32
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:04,833
[man 9] Yeah.

33
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,700
[man 10]
And she's working on that project?

34
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:09,167
[man 11] They'll be done in about a week.
I was gonna say...

35
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:13,133
<i>[man over PA] Don Taylor, report
to Laser Laboratory Building B, Laser Lab.</i>

36
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,667
[man 1] Okay, I'll take a look.

37
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,627
- Where have you been?
- [Clyne] Solving problems.

38
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,233
You look... dusty.

39
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:25,633
Sometimes you gotta get dusty, Efrem.

40
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,100
- Test the pulse?
- Yeah.

41
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,867
Went down to the vault,
asked Johnson for some tetracene,

42
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:31,800
but apparently, we don't store it.

43
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:34,267
It's outdated and expensive as shit.

44
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,033
It got expensive.
Back in the '90s, it used to be cheap.

45
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,967
So, if you look hard enough...
you can still find some lying around.

46
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:45,300
You find a street gang
that slings tetracene?

47
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:47,833
Industrial printer cartridge,
$14.99 back in the day.

48
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,833
- Get me a mount, would you?
- Here you go.

49
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,033
Thank you.

50
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,933
[Efrem] You gonna tell the suits
you're running this on a 20-year-old part?

51
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,700
I'll show them it works and say:

52
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:59,833
"That's the difference between a prototype
and a production model."

53
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Okay.

54
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,200
Concavity is spun to zero.

55
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,733
Lens track is hot.

56
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:10,933
Alignment is keyed in.

57
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,633
You are good to go.

58
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,633
I'll let you call it.

59
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,100
[whirring, then beeping]

60
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:22,267
[powering up]

61
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:32,933
If you think about the applications on
other materials, it could be significant.

62
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,033
Metals, for instance, can be shattered
with very little effort or noise.

63
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:42,000
Concrete, rubber... they're all vulnerable
to violent temperature changes.

64
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:46,767
Yeah, this project started
as a request from SEAL Team 6.

65
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,200
After the siege in Rwanda,

66
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:51,333
they came to us
asking for the capability...

67
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,367
to flash freeze or boil
the enemy's water supply.

68
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:58,200
Now, this device could have
driven the enemy out.

69
00:06:58,267 --> 00:07:00,933
And you... tried this on living things?

70
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:07,667
That wasn't our intent here, initially.

71
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:09,967
We'd like you test it.

72
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:12,367
Any volunteers?

73
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,367
[chuckling]

74
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:17,000
[chuckles] Well... we'll give it a try.

75
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:20,800
Gentlemen, why don't we go sit down?
We'll talk over the next steps. All right?

76
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:22,833
Yeah. Right this way.

77
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,200
[indistinct chattering]

78
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,033
[Mindala] What do you want,
a clean conscience?

79
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:33,667
Test it with a slab of beef
for all I care.

80
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:36,833
What I want is to use it
for what we originally designed it as.

81
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
A deterrent.

82
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:41,267
Nobody said anything
about microwaving people's lungs.

83
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,333
It's war.

84
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,967
It's the business we're in.

85
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:47,367
Remember what you sold it to me as
when you hired me?

86
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,733
Defense.

87
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,700
[chuckles]
And that's still partially true.

88
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,267
But war is good business.

89
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,300
So is human trafficking.

90
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:59,000
We work for DARPA, Mark.
We work for the government.

91
00:07:59,867 --> 00:08:02,267
"I don't know what weapons
we'll use in World War III,

92
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:06,233
- but World War IV will be fought with..."
- "Sticks and stones." Albert Einstein.

93
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,633
- He worked for the government.
- Mm-hm. That's right.

94
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:12,733
And if you ask him, I don't think
he thought that was his finest hour.

95
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,300
I'm sure he has feelings about
flash-boiling human flesh.

96
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,600
Ever think about prosthetic limbs
with full sensory feedback?

97
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:21,367
Ah. Prosthetics... don't win wars.

98
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:23,933
Did you hear that?

99
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,500
That is the empathetic scientist
in you dying.

100
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Hmm.

101
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,600
Did you brief your guys
on how to operate the ray?

102
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:31,967
- I did.
- Good.

103
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,733
Then you can start packing.

104
00:08:34,867 --> 00:08:36,000
Can you be more specific?

105
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:37,067
Mm-hm.

106
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,667
About these goggles.

107
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:43,067
Your... hyperspectral goggles

108
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:48,033
being deployed by Special Forces
in Eastern Europe in the Moldovan War.

109
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,133
- I'm aware. I read the field reports.
- No, you have not read this report.

110
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:55,800
Orland called me personally.
General Orland.

111
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:59,267
He said things are very...
sensitive down there.

112
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,833
And they're... seeing things.

113
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,600
Okay. Like what?

114
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
They won't tell me.

115
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,667
They won't share the video feed.
They won't discuss what they're seeing.

116
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:16,767
They just want the lead engineer
down there to advise and consult.

117
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:21,100
Look, you invented these goggles
to keep our guys safe.

118
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:23,067
Well, now they need your help.

119
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,167
Think of it as defense.

120
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,480
[man 1] Let me reboot the guidance system.

121
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,561
[man 2] It's locked tight.
We have to pull it out.

122
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,440
{\an8}[man 3] All right, let's go. Move it out.

123
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:59,300
[indistinct chattering]

124
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:10,300
- Mark Clyne?
- What?

125
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:12,833
You the guy that designed
the helmet cam?

126
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,600
- Yes. Mark Clyne.
- James Orland. Come with me.

127
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,200
[Clyne]
A lot of new boots on the ground here.

128
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:22,633
[Orland] The country's in chaos.

129
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,267
The insurgency is mostly remnants
of the military dictatorship

130
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,667
that ran this place
until about two months ago.

131
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:32,700
And their popular support is primarily
in the north part of the country...

132
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:35,333
near the Russian border,
and here in the capital.

133
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:38,167
The problem is
their forces are well-trained.

134
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,667
They're threatening to turn
this whole thing into a civil war.

135
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:47,067
[indistinct chattering]

136
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:49,967
Moldova. Russians had it, lost it.

137
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,667
It became independent,
but it's struggling internally.

138
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:56,700
On the one hand, you have an insurgency,

139
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:59,700
made up of the regime's
former elite soldiers.

140
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:01,600
They're well-trained and dangerous.

141
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,900
On the other,
you have most of the population,

142
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:07,300
who are tearing down the regime's flags
and demanding a new government.

143
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:11,967
Civil unrest, as complicated as it is,
is a business we're familiar with.

144
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:13,700
We like to think we're good at it.

145
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:16,733
But this thing your camera found...

146
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,300
it's a whole new piece of business.

147
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:30,233
I can't send this video to EUCOM.
I'm just afraid they'd think it's a joke.

148
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,940
[Clyne]
DOD doesn't have a sense of humor.

149
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,033
[Orland] Typically not. Hook us up.

150
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:39,967
I'm sure there's a scientific explanation
for what's on these,

151
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,033
but until you tell me,

152
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,067
I'm not sending it
up the chain of command.

153
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:47,133
- You done?
- [man] Yes, sir.

154
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
- Get out. Seal us in. Wait outside.
- Sir.

155
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,200
[door closes]

156
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:57,267
Nobody here has been able
to make heads or tails of this.

157
00:11:57,933 --> 00:12:00,167
It's thrown a wrench
into our entire operation

158
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:02,833
for reasons I'm not at liberty
to discuss with you.

159
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,733
I can tell you we need answers fast.

160
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:32,200
- Do you mind?
- You spotted that quick.

161
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:39,367
Five different helmet cams picked up
something similar in the last three weeks.

162
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,367
At first, our signals intelligence tech
wrote it off as interference.

163
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:47,333
That's not interference.

164
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:52,667
I don't think you'd fly me
all the way here for interference.

165
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:55,133
Wanna tell me what you're thinking?

166
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,167
I want you to tell me
what you're thinking.

167
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,300
I don't know what I'm thinking... yet.

168
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:02,633
But there is an explanation.

169
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:08,733
[Orland] That was the first sighting.
Three others just like it.

170
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,133
The last was different.
It involved a member of Delta Force,

171
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,967
that makes it particularly sensitive.

172
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:16,100
This is Fran Madison with CIA.

173
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:19,700
What Special Ops does here
is done under CIA covert operations.

174
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:22,000
You need to sign this
before we go any further.

175
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:25,333
- What is this?
- It's an SCI oath.

176
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,333
You're acknowledging it's life in prison
if you reveal anything you're told.

- [man] Yes, ma'am.

181
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:10,967
Three days ago
we conducted a raid in mid-city.

182
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,267
Our communications were intermittent,
and a guy got separated from the group...

183
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,000
where he ended up killed in action.

184
00:14:20,633 --> 00:14:22,300
He got closer than anybody.

185
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,100
Too close.

Sergeant Chris Davis.

193
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,267
Three-tour combat vet. Best of the best.

194
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:19,800
In the last few weeks
we've been finding bodies around the city

195
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:21,300
that were killed in the same way.

196
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,700
The autopsies defied all explanation.

197
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:26,733
Their internal organs were frozen

198
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,833
and yet, their skin was burned
and corroded.

199
00:15:30,267 --> 00:15:34,667
The only response from the allied Moldovan
military contact is shock, confusion.

200
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:35,933
And there's anger.

201
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:40,333
There's teenagers spray-painting
"genocide aratare" at kill sites.

202
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,733
- Genocide...?
- "Aratare."

203
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,333
It's a local myth. The ghosts of war.

204
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,300
"As nightmarish as."
That's the literal translation.

205
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,167
- That's very poetic.
- [Fran] Well, they're superstitious.

206
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:53,033
They somehow think...

207
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:57,767
the horrors of the war have
kicked up something unnatural.

208
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:01,367
- We hope you have an alternate theory.
- What do you think?

209
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,900
- Think you need a new name for them.
- Beyond that.

210
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,700
- Give me a copy of the data, some time...
- That's not possible.

211
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,800
You want me to figure this out right now?

212
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:13,107
- [Orland] We want your assessment.
- I don't have one yet.

213
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:16,600
Then, I think we have to send our
working theory up the chain of command.

214
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:19,233
- I don't wanna do that.
- Okay. What is your working theory?

215
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,667
The agency thinks
this is some kind of cloaking technology.

216
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,233
Insurgent soldiers wearing
active camouflage.

217
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,233
In this country? Something that advanced?

218
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,800
CIA knows a few groups in Europe and Asia
could be working on active camouflage.

219
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:36,000
DARPA's worked on cloaking technology.
We're years away from a prototype.

220
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:39,333
- Maybe somebody beat you to it.
- DARPA is the leader in the field.

221
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,700
Are you certain of that?

222
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,800
The regime spent heavily
on weapons research.

223
00:16:43,867 --> 00:16:47,267
Corruption, loose legislation.
You're a military lab and want obscurity?

224
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,833
- This is a great place to work and hide.
- Okay.

225
00:16:54,733 --> 00:16:56,267
Let's say it is cloaking technology.

226
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:01,267
- How do you account for cause of death?
- A shock delivered to the victim.

227
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,300
I think you're reaching.

228
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:05,667
Our business requires us
to make suppositions.

229
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,600
My business requires us to prove them.

230
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,767
Your technician's job is to find glitches,
so, he sees glitches.

231
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:15,300
Your job is to find the enemy,
so, you see the enemy.

232
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:18,367
Locals believe in spirits,
so they see spirits.

233
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:21,033
Everyone is biased, in one way or another.

234
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:25,667
So, my answer to you right now is that
we lack data to support any theory.

235
00:17:26,267 --> 00:17:27,267
Okay.

236
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,933
What do you need
to make a more definitive statement?

237
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:42,300
First, you need a better shot.

238
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:44,633
That's what I'm looking for,
a better shot.

239
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:46,267
How?

240
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,233
- Right here, sir.
- That's it.

241
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,233
I brought this from DARPA.
A hyperspectral camera.

242
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,267
A more powerful version of the helmet cams
your guys are using.

243
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,333
It sees deeper into the spectrum of light.

244
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Visible or invisible,
if something's there, this'll pick it up.

245
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:07,267
Can you mount this thing...
on a Delta vehicle?

246
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,300
- I don't see why not.
- [Orland] All right, good.

247
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:11,367
We run missions into the city every day.

248
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:14,633
I'll put you with our field tech,
tell him how to operate it.

249
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,167
I wouldn't put a tech in between
this camera and myself.

250
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,067
So, you wanna operate it?

251
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:26,600
If you want that kill shot... you'll need
a fast reaction time out there.

252
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:28,700
Next mission, you ride with Delta.

253
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,100
They're gonna get you close to this thing.
You get me the kill shot...

254
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:36,067
you can go home to Virginia
without unpacking.

255

[man 1]
Got a bad rotor, you gotta swap that out.

256
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,900
[man 2] Weld it onto the front panel.

Well, well, well. Toll, check that out.

259
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:57,200
- [man 1] What's this guy up to, man?
- [man 2] I don't know.

260
00:18:57,267 --> 00:18:58,600
[man 3] Believe this guy?

261
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:00,333
- [man 4] If it works.
- [man 5] For real.

[whistles]

263
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:05,133
Heard you're installing a camera
on our truck.

264
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,600
Which was fine
until you ripped out that 50 cal.

265
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:09,667
You're taking down a gun
to put up a camera?

266
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:12,200
It's the only place large enough
to mount it.

267
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:16,133
[Toll] You guys get that, right?
I know it sounds like a terrible idea.

268
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:20,933
We prefer to dance with who brung us...
Dr. Clyne. You get that, right?

269
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,233
"Dance with who brung you"?
No, actually, I don't.

270
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:28,600
This truck has saved our lives,
many times.

271
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:29,867
I understand.

272
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,800
[Cabrera] You guys know Dr. Clyne's team
built that truck?

273
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:35,700
Clyne works over at DARPA.

274
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:41,200
I've worked closely with his group.
Been to their facilities in Virginia.

275
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:44,667
- Good to see you, Dr. Clyne.
- Good to see you, Captain Cabrera.

276
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:47,967
They retrofitted these trucks
with tougher, lighter weight armor.

277
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:50,967
They designed the mechanical loaders
that do the heavy lifting,

278
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:53,200
so you boys don't strain yourselves
too hard.

279
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:55,333
Matter of fact, Dr. Clyne himself

280
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,667
developed the thin weight Kevlar
body stocking that literally...

281
00:19:58,733 --> 00:19:59,894
[Toll grunts] [soldiers groan]

282
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:00,933
Protects your balls.

283
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,000
So, I would think there'd be nothing
but goodwill in this group for Dr. Clyne.

284
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,200
- Major Sessions.
- Captain, have your men fall back.

285
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:14,367
- [man 1] Get back to it.
- [man 2] Get her done.

286
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:15,333
This is Dr. Clyne.

287
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,300
He's worked with us eight or ten times
over the last five years.

288
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:21,067
You ever go out with the assault team?

289
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:23,067
No, sir.

290
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:24,767
He's a good man, major.

291
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:28,100
That's great. I'm just not a fan
of taking tourists on combat missions.

292
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:29,600
Sir, I'm not a tourist.

293
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:32,233
If you're not carrying an M4,
you're a tourist.

294
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,800
I'll carry one, if you'd like.

295
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:35,600
We gotta get Dr. Clyne out in the field

296
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,900
to track the target force
and get a kill shot.

297
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:40,000
How long before
this equipment's operational?

298
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:41,367
A few hours.

299
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:43,700
- Is it gonna work?
- If we get close enough.

300
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,600
Let me tell you something.
Sergeant Davis... he got close enough.

301
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:51,733
That's the best Delta that we had.

302
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:56,100
Make sure your equipment
is top-notch this time.

303
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:06,067
- They were like brothers.
- I get it.

304
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,000
Okay.

305
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:13,033
Evening, doc.

306
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,200
[indistinct chattering]

307
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:29,867
[Cabrera] Hear you two hit it off bigtime.

308
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:30,933
[chuckles]

309
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:37,767
- She can come off a bit intense.
- Yeah. So can you.

310
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,633
I'm just here to find this thing.

311
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,900
You're willing to go on
a combat mission to find it.

312
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:45,833
She is, too.

313
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,167
She's under a lot of pressure from D.C.

314
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:51,833
They want an answer
and it's her job to give them one.

315
00:21:51,967 --> 00:21:53,767
Saw your names on a mission roster.

316
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:56,867
I knew this was a top priority...

317
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,000
but for them to embed you both...

318
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:05,100
Well, you don't have to worry about me.

319
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:08,933
I'm not worried about you, doc.
I'm worried about it.

320
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:13,067
She's hoping it's cloaking technology.

321
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:15,867
What do you think it is?

322
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,367
Something no one's thought of yet.

323
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,333
Gentlemen, yesterday at 1800 hours,

324
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,333
Utah Team left here on a recon mission
to Durlesti,

325
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,200
when they were engaged by insurgents.

326
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,233
We managed to hear most
of their chatter during the firefight,

327
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,700
but come were unreliable.

328
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:38,900
Target is a five-story
apartment building here.

329
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:43,033
We think what's left of Utah Team
is being held on the fourth floor,

330
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,867
in the northwest corner apartment.

331
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:47,267
We're gonna be knee-deep
in an insurgent-held area.

332
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,333
So, we should expect a fight.

333
00:22:50,133 --> 00:22:51,133
One last thing.

334
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,600
Before our guys were grabbed,
they radioed in that they saw

335
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,667
what we're calling
hyperspectral anomalies.

336
00:22:58,233 --> 00:23:01,700
Your mission is a quick extraction.
You get our guys and you get out.

337
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,167
However, if engaged,
neutralize the anomalies in the area.

338
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:07,233
[Toll] Neutralize them?

339
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:12,200
- How?
- Yeah, what are we dealing with here?

340
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:15,833
We believe these are enemy soldiers
in advanced electronic camouflage.

341
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,167
- So, be surgical when you fire.
- If we don't really know what they are...

342
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:21,867
Excuse me?
Would you like to add something?

343
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,867
If they are wearing cloaking technology,

344
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:28,733
you need to bring it back
as intact as possible.

345
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,300
Dr. Clyne and Agent Madison
will be on mission with you.

346
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:34,767
Dr. Clyne will be monitoring
your helmet-cam feeds

347
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,800
from the second MRAP vehicle
in the convoy.

348
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,800
Major Sessions will lead Dagger Team 1
to do the extraction.

349
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:43,800
Stay on come. Get your gear.

350
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:49,233
- [man 1] Partner, let's go.
- [man 2] AJ, front and center.

351
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:51,867
[man 3] Weapons check, Billy.

352
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,867
[man 4] You got it.

353
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,167
<i>[man 1]
Our ride not smooth enough for you?</i>

354
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:32,000
<i>[man 2]
And you call yourself hard-ass.</i>

355
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:34,333
<i>[man 3] They really need
to repave these roads, man.</i>

356
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:03,133
All right, guys,
we're coming into the abandoned zone.

357
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,633
Expect a heavy insurgent presence.

358
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,461
[indistinct chattering over radio]

359
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,300
[man] Okay.

360
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:27,347
<i>[Sessions]
I've got an insurgent body here.</i>

361
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:39,100
I got Agopia from Utah Team.
Confirmed KIA.

362
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,100
<i>None of these guys appear to have taken
any rounds. No entry or exit wounds.</i>

363
00:27:44,867 --> 00:27:47,167
Alessio here. Moving to the fifth floor.

364
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,600
- We got movement.
- Toll, check your 2 o'clock.

365
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:11,100
Where? We don't see anything.

366
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:13,667
- That's it. Right there.
- You're right on top of it.

367
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,667
<i>[Clyne] It's a motion signature.
There's something under that tub.</i>

368
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,933
[Sessions] Lewis, the tub.
I want you to flip over the tub.

369
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:36,367
- Toll, I want you on what's underneath.
- I'm on it.

370
00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:44,000
One, two, three.

371
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:52,800
We have Comstock alive and conscious.

372
00:28:52,867 --> 00:28:55,900
<i>Repeat. We have Sergeant Comstock
from Utah Team.</i>

[grunting]

375
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,167
Hey, buddy.

376
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,300
- Where's the rest of your team?
- They're upstairs.

377
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:10,800
But they're all gone.
Got under their skin.

378
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,933
- What got under their skin...?
- I saw it.

379
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:15,300
- But...?
- Blanket.

380
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:17,867
Like a frozen blanket.

381
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:22,133
- Okay, where is the rest of Utah?
- Oh, they're dead.

382
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,633
Yeah, they're all dead.

383
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,333
We're all dead.

384
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,100
<i>- Where are the bodies?
- I told you, they're on the top floor.</i>

385
00:30:07,067 --> 00:30:08,300
Oh, you haven't seen it.

386
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,800
I've seen it.
You know I believe in God, John.

387
00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:15,733
This is the opposite of God.

388
00:30:27,633 --> 00:30:29,867
Wait. Who's this?
Can you tell him to turn back?

389
00:30:29,933 --> 00:30:32,267
McFadden, turn back.
Give us a view of that room.

390
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:35,173
[McFadden] Nothing's there.
I'm standing right here.

391
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,767
Mac, we're both staring right at it.
It's in the middle of your view port.

392
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:41,600
What? That? It's a smear.

393
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,867
Probably these piece-of-shit goggles.

394
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,900
- No, no, no. Tell him to put them back on.
- Mac, put the goggles back on.

395
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,967
<i>Mac, do it now.</i>

396
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,800
- What the...?
- Take the shot.

397
00:31:02,067 --> 00:31:03,267
They went right through it.

398
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:04,900
- Did he miss?
- He doesn't miss.

00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,667
- Okay.
- I could feel it.

462
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,100
Land mines! Hold on!

463
00:35:42,233 --> 00:35:43,233

Hey, buddy, look at me. No, no, no.

469
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:30,167
Shit.

470
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,633
[man 1] Open the door.

471
00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:38,167
[man 2] Yeah.

472
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,767
- [man 1] Come on. Now, move.
- [man 3] Come on.

473
00:36:47,867 --> 00:36:49,100
Both drivers are dead.

474
00:36:49,933 --> 00:36:53,000
Archer Lima 2. Hit a land mine.

475
00:36:53,067 --> 00:36:54,700
Both vehicles destroyed.

[radio static]

477
00:36:56,233 --> 00:36:57,233
We are...

478
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:01,700
three clicks southeast of target building.

479
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,521

We are losing your transmission.</i>

<i>Your transponders are down.</i>

481
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,267
No shit.
Our vehicles were just blown to hell.

482
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:10,600
We need to find cover.

483

<i>- I can't hear what you're saying.
- Clyne, leave the camera.</i>

[man 1] Come on, Clyne.

485
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:25,967
[man 2] Go, go, go.

486
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,700
[man 3] Move, move.

487
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,200
[man 4] Cover.

Clear.

494
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:49,367
[Sessions] Who's injured?

495
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:51,733
- Diaz?
- [Diaz] I think my ankle's broke.

496
00:37:53,067 --> 00:37:56,100
We need an airlift.
I can't get a signal to base. Keep trying.

497
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:57,900
[Talbot] Com.
Get over here. Get over here.

498
00:37:57,967 --> 00:37:58,967
[man] Yeah.

499
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:03,200
[Talbot] Archer Lima 2. Archer Lima 2.

500
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,100
This is Dagger Team 1, over.

501
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,167
[man 1] I'm good. I'm good.

502
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:10,933
[man 2] Can they get in that way?

503
00:38:12,933 --> 00:38:13,933
[man 3] You all right?

504
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
[Talbot]
Archer Lima 2, this is Dagger Team 1.

505
00:38:16,067 --> 00:38:17,233
Do you copy? Over.

506
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:23,900
Archer Lima 2, this is Dagger Team 1.
Do you copy? Over.

507
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:26,967
Hey.

508
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,267
- How you doing? You're bleeding.
- Hmm?

509
00:38:36,267 --> 00:38:37,267
Okay.

510
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,333
You hit your head.

511
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,700
You hit your head.

512
00:38:44,367 --> 00:38:45,367
Did you black out?

513
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:48,900
Yeah, I guess so.

514
00:38:50,933 --> 00:38:51,933
Major.

515
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:57,300
- She hit her head pretty bad.
- Let me see.

516
00:38:59,733 --> 00:39:00,633
Pupils are huge.

517
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,667
Sir, I'm sending
but they're not receiving.

518
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:05,667
I'm hearing a click back
as soon as I sign over, but no answer.

519
00:39:05,733 --> 00:39:06,600
Keep trying.

520
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:08,600
She's in shock. Keep an eye on her.

521
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,700
[Talbot] Archer Lima 2,
this is Dagger Team 1. Do you copy? Over.

522
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,833
[man 1]... over there.

523
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,233
- Thanks.
- [man 2] Yeah.

524
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,967
Where's everyone else?
Where's the rest of Utah?

525
00:39:17,933 --> 00:39:20,200
I'm Sergeant Chen. I was with Utah.

526
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:25,367
We were the second team in last night.
There was eight of us.

527
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:31,833
- Do you have confirmed KIAs for Utah?
- Well, I can tell you this much.

528
00:39:32,367 --> 00:39:35,167
Sergeant Comstock won't be
on your Christmas card this year.

529
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:38,267
- You saw insurgents kill Comstock?
- [Alessio] Insurgents?

530
00:39:38,633 --> 00:39:39,733
Is this guy for real?

531
00:39:41,633 --> 00:39:44,133
- What rock were you under?
- I was the radio operator.

532
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:47,033
We lost come.
I was stuck in the truck the whole night.

533
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,833
- I never saw the active camouflage.
- Active camouflage?

534
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,233
Even if there was a such thing,
and there's not...

535
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,767
how does a human wearing active camouflage
walk through walls?

536
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:59,267
[Alessio] Or through three mags
of armor-piercing ammo?

537
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:01,733
I saw Pat pump 150 rounds at one of them.

538
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,067
This thing's killed
at least 19 of our men.

539
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:08,600
And we have no idea what it is.

540
00:40:14,767 --> 00:40:15,767
Clyne.

541
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
You saw it.

542
00:40:20,733 --> 00:40:21,733
What was it?

543
00:40:23,233 --> 00:40:24,233
Human.

544
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,933
Had a human form.

545
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,167
It looked at me, it was conscious.

546
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:36,233
Like a person.

547
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:38,767
[scoffs]

548
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:43,767
Is there anything that explains
what you saw?

549
00:40:45,033 --> 00:40:46,033
No.

550
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,000
Let's pull together
all the functional goggles that we have.

551
00:40:51,233 --> 00:40:55,167
- My goggles were wasted in the crash, sir.
- Yeah. Mine, too. They're trashed.

552
00:40:55,233 --> 00:40:57,733
[man] Forget the goggles.
We can't recharge them anyway.

553
00:40:58,333 --> 00:40:59,367
So, what do we do?

554
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:01,967
How are we supposed to see them?

555
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,933
Maybe that camera can still help us.

556
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,733
If we get to an elevated position,
we'd have a better vantage point.

557
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,800
Help me with this?

558
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,600
[Sessions] Let's go. Let's move out. Move.

[Sessions] They're everywhere.

562
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,033
[Alessio] Something's stopping them.

563
00:41:58,033 --> 00:41:59,933
Some sort of black sand.

564
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,333
[Comstock] I fell in that sand.

565
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:05,933
- I had to... pick it out of my hand.
- Let me see it.

566
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:12,700
- Little, sharp pieces of metal.
- They're iron filings.

567
00:42:13,933 --> 00:42:15,633
- It's pure iron.
- [man] Yeah.

568
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,667
And there's a trail of it...
all the way around the building.

569
00:42:26,267 --> 00:42:28,367
It's a barrier. Someone put it there.

570
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:32,867
I don't think we're alone.

571
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,233
Let's stack up and sweep upstairs.

572
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
Point and shoot?

573
00:42:41,633 --> 00:42:42,767
Point and shoot.

574
00:43:19,067 --> 00:43:21,600
[indistinct chattering]

575
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:53,333
Breach! Breach!

[girl speaking in foreign language]

578
00:44:03,733 --> 00:44:05,700
- [Sessions] I've got kids.
- [man 1] Clear.

00:44:05,767 --> 00:44:07,033
- [man 2] Clear.
- All clear.

580
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,100
Tell them to take the long wall.

581
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:21,767
Ask them where they got this,
and who else is here.

582
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:23,867
[speaking in foreign language]

583
00:44:27,133 --> 00:44:30,733
Ask them if there's anyone else
in the factory, and do they have guns.

[speaking in foreign language]

585
00:44:43,233 --> 00:44:45,200
[in English] She says they're here alone.

586
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,067
Only that one gun. No soldiers are here.

587
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,300
- No one at all.
- [man] Major Sessions.

588
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,700
- What's the problem?
- This factory has a transmission tower.

589
00:44:59,933 --> 00:45:01,133
It puts out a huge signal.

590
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,033
So, what's the problem?

591
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:06,200
Everyone within 20 miles will hear
our conversation with base.

592
00:45:07,067 --> 00:45:09,300
Any insurgent radio will pick up
our transmission.

593
00:45:10,767 --> 00:45:13,700
Insurgents are the least of your worries.

594
00:45:13,767 --> 00:45:15,967
Connect me to General Orland
as soon as possible.

[Clyne] Hey, I need to ask you something.

605
00:46:13,367 --> 00:46:17,867
Was it your idea...
to put the barrier... outside?

Their father. Their father knew.

608
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:28,200
Their father rolled open barrels
of the iron shavings around the building.

609
00:46:29,233 --> 00:46:30,333
He saved their lives.

610

What happened to your father?

00:47:03,067 --> 00:47:04,000
Aratare.

620
00:47:04,067 --> 00:47:05,733
[speaks in foreign language]

621
00:47:06,133 --> 00:47:08,833
- He says, "Don't say that word."
- Ask him what they are.

622
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,100
[Fran & Bogdan speaking
in foreign language]

623
00:47:11,167 --> 00:47:12,167
[in English] Lost souls.

624
00:47:13,067 --> 00:47:14,067
Souls of the dead.

625
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:20,233
They're trapped between life and death,
and they can't find peace.

626
00:47:22,133 --> 00:47:23,300
How's that happen?

627
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:27,867
He says, "War."

628
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,300
Come on.

629
00:47:42,967 --> 00:47:44,933
If their father put down
the iron shavings,

630
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,267
he knows more about these things
than any of us do.

631
00:47:48,233 --> 00:47:49,700
Ask her where her father is.

632
00:47:50,933 --> 00:47:52,267
[speaking in foreign language]

633
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:23,800
[speaking in foreign language]

634
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,333
[in English]
Her brother, Bogdan, doesn't know.

635
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,600
He thinks he went to get help.

636
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,333
He died outside,
when he was making the barrier.

637
00:48:34,167 --> 00:48:35,700
She had to bring him in here.

638
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:37,667
I'm so sorry.

639
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,767
- Okay?
- Yeah.

640
00:48:49,867 --> 00:48:51,067
Ceramic tile.

641
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:56,867
Ask her how her father knew about
the iron filings stopping the Aratare.

642
00:48:57,633 --> 00:49:00,767
- What else did he know about them?
- [Fran] She doesn't know.

643
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:06,900
[Clyne] "Masarov."

644
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,900
- What is Masarov?
- [Fran] It's a place.

645
00:49:09,967 --> 00:49:11,333
It's a district up the river.

646
00:49:11,967 --> 00:49:13,167
[speaking in foreign language]

647
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,200
It's where it all began.

648
00:49:18,233 --> 00:49:20,633
It's where the Aratare killings started.

649
00:49:21,267 --> 00:49:22,267
Aratare.

650
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,133
I'm saying we land the helos right here.

651
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,933
Extract us from this roof
and get us the hell out of here.

652
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,767
There are power lines everywhere.
The helos would have to fly low and slow.

653
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:35,967
Easy pickings
for a teenager with a rocket.

654
00:49:36,633 --> 00:49:38,767
Can you get me up to speed?
You spoke with base?

655
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:41,733
Yeah. The general's sending in helos
to come get us,

656
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,333
and tanks to secure the landing zone
in an open plaza

657
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,300
- about half a mile from here, at dawn.
- That's a long way on foot.

658
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,900
You think we can make it a half a mile?
With kids?

659
00:49:52,967 --> 00:49:56,267
We don't have an option. Okay?
All the roads are either blocked or mined.

660
00:49:56,333 --> 00:49:58,333
And since we used the tower
to talk to base,

661
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,867
everyone knows where we are.
We gotta move out.

662
00:50:00,933 --> 00:50:04,167
[Alessio] You wanna go running around
with those things roaming the streets?

663
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:06,133
Even though we have no way to fight them?

664
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,600
[man 1] Better than waiting for them
to find a way in.

665
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:11,507
[Alessio] The only reason we're
still alive is that barricade out there.

666
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,233
Eventually they're gonna get through.
It's just a matter of time.

667
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,767
- [man 2] Wait.
- [Sessions] We have to take our chances.

668
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:18,933
- This is the best plan that we have.
- Major.

669
00:50:19,733 --> 00:50:22,600
What if I said I can improve our chances
of making that plaza?

670
00:50:22,667 --> 00:50:24,667
- I'm listening.
- Take a look around you.

671
00:50:24,733 --> 00:50:28,867
Everything in this building...
is filled with this.

672
00:50:29,733 --> 00:50:30,733
Iron dust.

673
00:50:32,267 --> 00:50:34,600
And the iron stops the hyperspectrals.

674
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:36,700
Exactly. Weaponize it.

675
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,300
- Dirty bombs.
- Best idea I've heard all night.

676
00:50:40,133 --> 00:50:41,367
Let's collect the grenades.

677
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,233
[Sessions] Clyne.

678
00:51:19,767 --> 00:51:21,333
I need you to be our eyes out there.

679
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,167
- Can you haul that camera on foot?
- I've got a better idea.

680
00:51:25,633 --> 00:51:28,300
This camera already projects
the right wavelength of UV light.

681
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:33,267
If I can turn it inside out, by reversing
the polarity of some of the components,

682
00:51:33,733 --> 00:51:36,333
I might be able to turn it from a camera
into a searchlight.

683
00:51:37,067 --> 00:51:39,067
We'll be able to see them
with our own eyes.

684
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,833
- That'd be a game-changer.
- Think I can talk to the convoy?

685
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,267
I'll them how to do the same
with their equipment.

686
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:47,867
When they come get us,
they're gonna need eyes, too.

687
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,767
I'll connect you
to the main engineer back at base.

688
00:52:07,133 --> 00:52:08,167
Copy that.

689
00:52:10,033 --> 00:52:12,900
They're ready to equip their vehicles
with whatever you need.

690
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:15,800
Can you repeat
the whole request back to me, please?

691
00:52:15,867 --> 00:52:17,333
<i>Okay, yes. That's correct.</i>

692
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,967
<i>What you need is a device that emits
a very short wavelength of light.</i>

693
00:52:21,033 --> 00:52:23,233
<i>I can tell you exactly how to rewire that.</i>

694
00:52:23,967 --> 00:52:26,000
<i>Do you have anything
you can mount on a tank?</i>

695
00:52:54,633 --> 00:52:57,100
[girl speaking in foreign language]

696
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,767
[Alessio]
We got movement across the alleyway.

697
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,700
Guys, we got movement.
Can we get eyes on it?

698
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,200
[man]
Hey, guys, stand clear for a second.

699
00:53:28,133 --> 00:53:31,200
- What's the word on the convoy?
- Last contact was 50 minutes ago.

700
00:53:31,867 --> 00:53:34,000
They're on their way
to the extraction point.

701
00:54:00,233 --> 00:54:04,167
Here they come! Get your gear.
We're leaving this building in 15 seconds.

702
00:54:04,233 --> 00:54:05,800
[man] Okay, come on. Let's go.

703
00:54:06,267 --> 00:54:08,667
That was the fastest way
to the extraction point.

704
00:54:09,033 --> 00:54:09,967
- [girl] Yeah.
- Hey.

705
00:54:10,033 --> 00:54:11,267
She says she can show us another way.

00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:46,333
- Go! Go! Go!
- Go!

775
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,867
- Go, go, go.
- [man] Let's go.

776
00:59:48,933 --> 00:59:50,067
Move. Go on.

777
00:59:55,333 --> 00:59:56,767
[Sessions] On the ground.

778
00:59:58,267 --> 00:59:59,333
Fire.

779
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,167

- [Sessions] Move on my command.
- [man 1] Move it out!

786
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,367
[man 2 yelling indistinctly]

787
01:00:45,033 --> 01:00:46,200
Hey! Hey!

[man 3] Overhead!

Let's get to the tanks!
Move it to the tanks!

01:01:01,967 --> 01:01:03,133
- [man 2] Get back!

794
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,367
[man 3] Get back!

[man 2] Your six!

801
01:02:02,033 --> 01:02:04,767
- [man 3] Where are they?
- [man 4] I don't know!

802
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:06,434
- [Toll] Where's Bogdan?
- Where'd he go?

803
01:02:07,233 --> 01:02:09,033
- Who's got him?

[inaudible dialogue]

815
01:03:18,133 --> 01:03:19,633
- Come on!

816
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:20,767
- Take her.
- Get up.

817
01:03:20,833 --> 01:03:22,167
[Fran] Help her! Save her!

818
01:03:22,233 --> 01:03:23,333
[Talbot] I got her.

819
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,833
Let's go.

820
01:03:26,633 --> 01:03:30,133

Come on!

824
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,200
- [man 1] Get up. Come on.
- [man 2] Dr. Clyne, come on!

[sobbing]

828
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,900
- [indistinct chatter over radio]
- Major. General Orland.

829
01:04:56,867 --> 01:04:58,300
General, go for Sessions.

830
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,767
<i>[Orland] Base has been lost!</i>

831
01:05:00,267 --> 01:05:03,200
<i>- We're sending you to our refugee bunker!
- [Sessions] Yes, sir.</i>

832
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:08,167
Hey, where are we going?
Base is that way.

833
01:05:08,233 --> 01:05:10,767
- We're not going to base.
- Why not?

834
01:05:10,833 --> 01:05:12,233
It's been compromised.

835
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:19,300
Hey,
they're spreading through the streets.

836
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,700
[indistinct yelling]

837
01:05:22,767 --> 01:05:23,767
They're everywhere.

838
01:05:33,033 --> 01:05:35,200
[whimpering]

839
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,667
- They just gonna leave us here?
- There's more people to airlift.

840
01:05:58,733 --> 01:06:00,967
- What is this place?
- Entrance is over here.

841
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:12,667
[yelling in foreign language]

842
01:06:12,733 --> 01:06:14,833
[man 1 in English]
Open the door! Open the door!

843
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:15,967
[man 1] Get back!

844
01:06:16,033 --> 01:06:17,600
[Sessions] Put your weapons down.

845
01:06:17,667 --> 01:06:21,100
[soldiers speaking in foreign language]

846
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,867
[Sessions]
Put your weapons down! Do it now!

847
01:06:29,233 --> 01:06:32,700
[Fran speaking in foreign language]

848
01:06:35,633 --> 01:06:36,967
[speaking in foreign language]

849
01:06:39,633 --> 01:06:41,067
He's saying, "Safe inside."

850
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:44,833
Hey.

851
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,067
Okay. It's okay.

852
01:06:58,933 --> 01:07:00,967
[man speaking indistinctly]

853
01:07:02,633 --> 01:07:03,767
Stay close.

854
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:09,967
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me. Look at me.

855
01:07:10,033 --> 01:07:12,000
She's not okay. Come here.

856
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,333
I'm gonna need some room.
It's okay. It's okay.

857
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,800
[chattering in foreign language]

858
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,000
- [man] What the hell happened to base?
- Base got overrun.

859
01:07:27,067 --> 01:07:29,767
- The general is meeting us here.
- So, what is this place?

860
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,300
We're in a civilian refugee shelter.

861
01:07:32,967 --> 01:07:36,000
This bunker has 20 feet
of concrete and steel.

862
01:07:36,067 --> 01:07:38,933
Are we safe here? I have no idea.
But there's food and water.

863
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,067
Talbot, gather what you can.
Toll, Chen, head back to the entrance.

864
01:07:42,133 --> 01:07:44,133
There's a com center.
See who you can reach.

865
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,900
Alessio, you're with me. Let's go.

866
01:07:47,933 --> 01:07:49,200
- [Fran] There.
- Where?

867
01:07:49,267 --> 01:07:50,767
- There.
- [man] Right over there.

868
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:51,873
- Okay.
- [man] On the bed.

869
01:07:52,067 --> 01:07:53,933
You're okay. Shh. You're gonna be okay.

870
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,067
- [man] What happened?
- It's her shoulder.

871
01:07:57,133 --> 01:08:00,267
- Her shoulder has shrapnel in it.
- [man] We're gonna cut open her sleeve.

872
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:03,767
[man speaking in foreign language]

873
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,240
[woman speaking in foreign language]

874
01:08:09,267 --> 01:08:11,033
[man in English] Get the IV line ready.

875
01:08:14,933 --> 01:08:15,933
[Clyne] This is yours.

876
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,233
Now, I need your help, Sari,
to stop the Aratare.

877
01:08:20,733 --> 01:08:22,600
I need to know what your father knew.

878
01:08:23,067 --> 01:08:24,267
What did your father do?

879
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,133
- [speaks in foreign language]
- He worked with ceramics.

880
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,133
What did he make?

881
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,267
[Fran & Sari speaking in foreign language]

882
01:08:33,767 --> 01:08:35,300
[in English] He made containers.

883
01:08:39,667 --> 01:08:41,367
He made containers for Masarov.

884
01:08:42,733 --> 01:08:45,333
The power plant
where the Aratare came from.

885
01:08:47,033 --> 01:08:48,313
[man] Let's get the mask on her.

886
01:08:49,067 --> 01:08:50,367
Okay, we have to take her now.

887
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,900
[rumbling]

888
01:08:52,967 --> 01:08:55,267
[indistinct chattering]

889
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:00,667
[siren wailing]

890
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:04,333
- [man] This is the U.S. Armed Forces!
- Open it.

891
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:15,800
Lower your weapons.

892
01:09:34,633 --> 01:09:36,967
- How many are you?
- Not many.

893
01:09:51,133 --> 01:09:52,600
Let's give them a hand.

894
01:09:53,967 --> 01:09:54,967
[man 1] Let's go.

895
01:09:56,133 --> 01:09:57,700
[man 2] Bring as much as you can.

896
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,167
<i>[Orland] The base was overrun.</i>

897
01:10:00,733 --> 01:10:01,767
It was like a wave.

898
01:10:03,067 --> 01:10:04,067
Invisible.

899
01:10:04,933 --> 01:10:06,733
Men just started falling.

900
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,800
Our conventional weapons were useless.

901
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,667
I requested an order
to evacuate the base...

902
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:16,100
but our long-range come
are completely scrambled.

903
01:10:17,133 --> 01:10:18,900
So, I took all the gear I could.

904
01:10:18,967 --> 01:10:22,033
I started sending units north
out of the area of operation.

905
01:10:23,733 --> 01:10:25,933
Kept five aircraft
with the least amount of fuel,

906
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,367
stayed behind with one platoon.

907
01:10:31,067 --> 01:10:33,333
Out of the 240 of us,
we have 19 remaining.

908
01:10:36,967 --> 01:10:38,967
[Sessions] Did you get a message
to higher command?

909
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,600
[Orland] No.

910
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:44,633
- Is there a rescue mission planned?
- No. We intercepted radio chatter

911
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,800
from Moldovan friendlies
to find this place.

912
01:10:46,867 --> 01:10:49,167
We sent that bird to pick you up
and bring you here.

913
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,700
If you'd even tried to return to base,
you'd be dead.

914
01:10:54,233 --> 01:10:56,200
We're the last U.S. forces in the country?

915
01:10:57,167 --> 01:10:58,167
I hope so.

916
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:01,667
So, what's the plan, sir?

917
01:11:02,133 --> 01:11:03,600
Came here to regroup, major.

918
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:05,333
There's no plan.

919
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:14,800
- I recommend we fortify the entrance.
- Fortify with what?

920
01:11:14,867 --> 01:11:17,700
- We wait till a rescue mission...
- Fortify with what?

921
01:11:17,767 --> 01:11:19,667
They'll come through whatever you use.

922
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:23,600
- We need to take our chances on a helo...
- There's 20 minutes of flight time!

923
01:11:23,667 --> 01:11:26,100
Twenty minutes of flight time
in those birds. Not more!

924
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:28,333
There's not enough room
for all of us anyway.

925
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,033
We need to form teams
and take the aircraft.

926
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:33,000
But where you gonna go, major?

927
01:11:34,233 --> 01:11:35,600
You can't run from them.

928
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:39,067
You can't stop them.
Your weapons are useless.

929
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:41,900
We have no idea what they are!

930
01:11:42,767 --> 01:11:45,167
[man 1] If they come through
that door, we're sitting ducks.

931
01:11:45,233 --> 01:11:47,233
[man 2] We can't stop them!
We can't stop them!

932
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,833
[indistinct chattering]

933
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,233
[man 3] Take what we can and go.

934
01:11:57,833 --> 01:11:58,833
I know what they are.

935
01:12:03,067 --> 01:12:04,133
I know what they are.

936
01:12:05,967 --> 01:12:07,067
I know what they are.

937
01:12:07,767 --> 01:12:08,967
[chattering stops]

938
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,367
We think we're seeing things.

939
01:12:13,133 --> 01:12:15,800
We think it can't be real, but it kills.
So, it is real.

940
01:12:16,367 --> 01:12:17,367
It's something.

941
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,300
It's not light, it's not shadow,

942
01:12:19,367 --> 01:12:21,900
or some trick of the mind.
Pass through walls, check.

943
01:12:23,233 --> 01:12:24,967
Outside the visible spectrum, check.

944
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:27,700
Kills to the touch, check.

945
01:12:29,367 --> 01:12:32,800
Comstock. He was under a ceramic bathtub,
is that right?

946
01:12:34,133 --> 01:12:36,333
Tank armor.
It couldn't pass through tank armor.

947
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,367
M1 Abrams tank armor,
that's ceramic plating everywhere.

948
01:12:39,633 --> 01:12:42,600
It cannot pass through ceramic.
You know what that means?

949
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:45,200
It means this stuff isn't natural.

950
01:12:46,767 --> 01:12:47,767
Someone made it.

951
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:50,633
It's man-made.

952
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,000
Man-made how?

953
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,933
Okay. You have solid, liquid, gas.
Lava can turn into rock.

954
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,067
Ice can turn into water. Metals can melt.
These are natural states.

955
01:13:02,133 --> 01:13:05,200
But there are unnatural states.
Artificial states, man-made states.

956
01:13:06,767 --> 01:13:07,767
Condensate.

957
01:13:08,867 --> 01:13:10,100
Bose-Einstein condensate.

958
01:13:10,767 --> 01:13:13,933
A state of matter that was predicted
by Nath Bose and Albert Einstein.

959
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,833
It has some very unusual properties.
It can be slowed down by iron filings.

960
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:21,033
It cannot pass through ceramic,
but it can pass through walls.

961
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,600
It's so cold it will kill you instantly
on contact.

962
01:13:23,667 --> 01:13:25,700
It can do everything
we've been seeing here.

963
01:13:25,767 --> 01:13:29,333
To create Bose-Einstein condensate,
you need power, and you need a lot of it.

964
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,233
Masarov. The power plant.

965
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:33,233
Yes, Masarov. Where they were made.

966
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:36,300
You said this country was pouring billions
into weapons research.

967
01:13:37,067 --> 01:13:38,067
This is a weapon.

968
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:42,033
- And it was set loose, or it broke loose.
- All right, but these things climb.

969
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,600
They're like humans.
It looks like a person.

970
01:13:45,067 --> 01:13:47,200
So can marble and clay in the right hands.

971
01:13:47,267 --> 01:13:48,333
And I wanna know why.

972
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,333
Why they look like people.
I can't tell you how they did this.

973
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,633
What I can tell you...
is that someone made them.

974
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:58,700
If someone made them, they don't escape
the laws of the world. Nothing does.

975
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:01,800
It shines light on new laws,
and that's what we have to learn.

976
01:14:01,867 --> 01:14:04,600
- They have order and structure.
- They can be broken down.

977
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:08,300
Anything can be. It's just energy.
And since I know what they are,

978
01:14:08,367 --> 01:14:11,333
- I can build the right weapons.
- What kind of weapons?

979
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,133
Plasmic-discharge.
They can tear apart the condensate.

980
01:14:14,733 --> 01:14:18,133
- Where will we find weapons like that?
- We're gonna build them.

981
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:21,100
- Build them with what?
- Anything we can find in this bunker.

982
01:14:21,167 --> 01:14:23,700
Anything with electronics.
Optics, ballistic casings.

983
01:14:23,767 --> 01:14:25,667
All the gear you brought from base.

984
01:14:25,733 --> 01:14:28,233
We can take it all apart,
and I can build an arsenal.

985
01:14:28,667 --> 01:14:31,900
And then we can go to Masarov
and stop this before it goes any further.

986
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:35,633
Because if we don't, the condensate
will feed on all the energy in its path.

987
01:14:36,067 --> 01:14:37,067
It'll grow exponentially.

988
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:39,900
There's no limit
to how far they can spread.

989
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,667
Unless we stop them.

990
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:48,633
[man 1]
Let's get this gear inside, guys. Come on.

991
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:49,833
[man 2] Let's move!

992
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,267
[man 1] Same number each side.

993
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,833
[man 2] All right, let's go, boys!

994
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,100
[indistinct yelling]

995
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,000
[man 1] Any med patches in there?

996
01:15:26,067 --> 01:15:27,800
[man 2]
We got three of them over here.

997
01:15:28,067 --> 01:15:31,667
It's a ground-to-air tracking scope.
We can use this. They have good optics.

998
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,600
- Good. This is good.
- [man 1] Two more over there.

999
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:36,767
[man 2] See that 305?

1000
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:39,933
Half of these are labeled "defective."
We need a voltage counter.

1001
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,600
I want you to start testing these.

1002
01:15:44,867 --> 01:15:46,233
[man 1] All right, open it up.

1003
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,767
[man 2] Get that one open. Pop it.

1004
01:15:54,033 --> 01:15:55,233
Is that what I think it is?

1005
01:15:56,133 --> 01:15:57,933
[man 1] We got the lotus from base.

1006
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
[Alessio] That's badass.

1007
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,133
- Looks like a mechanical Rottweiler.
- Look at that.

1008
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:04,067
Clyne's making a few changes.

1009
01:16:04,133 --> 01:16:07,067
[Alessio] They're taking down a chain
hoist and putting up a searchlight.

1010
01:16:07,967 --> 01:16:08,967
Déjà vu.

1011
01:17:14,867 --> 01:17:18,000
- What does it fire?
- It's a focused energy pulse.

1012
01:17:18,833 --> 01:17:20,033
If my math is right...

1013
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:21,600
[whirring]

1014
01:17:22,067 --> 01:17:23,967
It should break down condensate.

1015
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:33,300
[Orland] Masarov.

1016
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:36,733
The single largest power plant
in the region.

1017
01:17:37,733 --> 01:17:41,200
It's where the killings started.
If they're man-made, they were made here.

1018
01:17:41,267 --> 01:17:43,067
It's less than ten clicks from here.

1019
01:17:44,233 --> 01:17:47,367
Our birds can make that,
but... it's probably one way.

1020
01:17:48,067 --> 01:17:51,833
I've been digging for clues with
the civilians. I found intel on Masarov.

1021
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:55,167
It's been retrofitted several times
over the last decade

1022
01:17:55,367 --> 01:17:56,667
by the central regime.

1023
01:17:56,833 --> 01:17:58,967
It's got "weapons research"
written all over it.

1024
01:17:59,033 --> 01:18:01,733
Okay, you and Clyne need to be
embedded to infiltrate.

1025
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,333
It's up to the both of you
to figure out how to stop this.

1026
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,600
We have to create a diversion.

1027
01:18:07,133 --> 01:18:10,267
We'll draw them out here
so you can infiltrate the structure

1028
01:18:10,333 --> 01:18:12,000
and try to find the source.

1029
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:20,133
Clyne's predicting the charge from these
will be extremely hot.

1030
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,967
Enough to destroy condensate.

1031
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:23,933
We'll find out soon enough.

1032
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:28,833
All right, boys.

1033
01:18:29,733 --> 01:18:30,733
This is it.

1034
01:18:32,267 --> 01:18:33,767
If you have any last words...

1035
01:18:34,633 --> 01:18:35,633
now's the time.

<i>[Orland] All right, listen up.</i>

01:19:05,933 --> 01:19:07,967
<i>You are using untested weapons...</i>

1039
01:19:09,267 --> 01:19:12,867
against an enemy that, to this point,
has been unstoppable.

1040
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,867
Now, you are heading
into unknown territory.

1041
01:19:15,933 --> 01:19:19,300
And hear me when I say you're gonna
see things you will not understand.

1042
01:19:19,967 --> 01:19:22,733
Our enemy has spread through the city
in a matter of days.

1043
01:19:23,233 --> 01:19:25,633
There's no telling
how far they will spread...

1044
01:19:26,267 --> 01:19:27,333
unless we fight back.

1045
01:19:29,867 --> 01:19:33,933
Most men never even come close...
to changing the future.

1046

This is the place.

And now is the time.

1048

Make no mistake,
you're the last line of defense.

2
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,440
- Master! How are you? - Are you alright?

3
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,580
I'm Iucky to be alive!

4
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,190
We must tell Master Chen

5
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,020
to go into hiding at once

6
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,600
Master, your leg is very badly injured

7
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,030
I think it's best you go into hiding for awhile

8
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,470
We'll cover you

9
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,670
OK, take care

10
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:23,940
Let's go!

11
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:49,970
Brother, take care! You too

12
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:50,900
Let's split up

13
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,740
Go that way!

14
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,310
I see you hiding there

15
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,950
Yen, you running dog of the Qing Dynasty!

16
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,830
Aren't you ashamed of your evil deeds?

17
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,590
Shut up, Ching!

18
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:24,470
If you tell me where Chen is...

19
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,430
I'll spare your life

20
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,010
and give you a handsome reward!

21
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,870
Stop dreaming! I'm a Sin Yi clan disciple

22
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,140
which is started by none other than the hero Yue Fei

23
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,880
I will not be a traitor

24
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,080
I'm not going to cooperate

25
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,850
Don't think that having a few evil tricks

26
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,790
will help you terrorize us

27
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,590
I'll fight you, even if it kills me!

28
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,330
You should give it some careful thought

29
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,030
I just want your life!

30
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,320
Today is the day you die!

31
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,450
Tell me where Chen is, now!

32
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,210
We've just moved here

33
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,050
and you're causing trouble already

34
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,850
What do I normally teach you?

35
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,460
Study the literatures. Act with reason

36
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,190
What else?

37
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,390
Train hard but never use kung fu to bully others!

38
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,760
Have you finished your training today?

39
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,370
I was just about to start

40
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,730
Grandpa, shall I start now?

41
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,300
Go ahead!

42
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,440
kick... kick

43
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,780
1, 2, 3... kick!

44
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,890
Twist and turn!

45
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,650
I've finished!

46
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:36,160
I'm too old. My eyes are bIurred

47
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,660
That was too quick! I couldn't see clearly

48
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,870
Do it again slowly so that I can see

49
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,200
- What is this? - The steady footwork!

50
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,010
It's footwork, all right

51
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,780
but not quite steady

52
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,050
Show me a proper stance

53
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,460
I said a proper stance

54
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,490
not a puppy stance!

55
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,130
Cross stance!

56
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,290
What else?

57
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,900
The Unicorn step! Twist right, twist left!

58
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,400
Steady yet?

59
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,340
Steady!

60
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,640
Move!

61
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,280
I can't!

62
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,610
Why not?

63
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,980
I'm so steady I'm grounded

64
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,780
Grounded?

65
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,520
There's another stance! Can you do that too?

66
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,490
I know! The twisted stance. How's this?

67
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,190
Not this one!

68
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,160
Another new stance? What is it?

69
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,960
The upside down stance

70
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,540
No, not this!

71
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,040
Stop your nonsense. Start!

72
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,140
I don't know how

73
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,570
Grandpa, don't!

74
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,220
This is my own special bowI!

75
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,140
Breaking it is like breaking my rice bowI!

76
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,490
- Understand? - Yes...

77
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,530
If anything happens to it, you've had it

78
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:20,090
I can't hold on much longer. Where are you off to?

79
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,590
To the toilet!

80
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,970
Hurry back! I can't stand it much more

81
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,100
This seems like fun

82
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,210
This? Here, take it!

83
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,370
I want this one

84
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,640
This is for you

85
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,580
I want this too

86
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,880
I want this doll

87
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,310
It's not for sale

88
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,890
I'll give you this one

89
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,190
Wait...

90
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,330
Place your bets

91
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,970
Test your eyes against my hands

92
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,830
Place your bets!

93
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,570
I'll bet everything

94
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,880
Quick! Place your bets

95
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,250
Come! Place your bets

96
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,180
Hands off!

97
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,480
Ready? OK!

98
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,590
Only a few winners this time!

99
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,030
Success!

100
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,770
Place your bets

101
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,200
Put it all down

102
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,730
You think you'll win the third round?

103
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,680
It's easy!

104
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,910
Easy?

105
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,410
I'll leave after winning this round

106
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,410
Good! Don't move

107
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,210
Open!

108
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,120
Mostly winners!

109
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,390
What rotten Iuck!

110
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,930
I've lost every round! I must win this time!

111
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,430
Let me help you!

112
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,370
I'll bet on this

113
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,230
Trust me, you won't regret it

114
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:09,870
You betting on this one?

115
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,840
Just you wait and see!

116
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,220
You're sure you're betting on this one?

117
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,450
Open!

118
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,950
Open!

119
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,730
You win!

120
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,060
Mostly winners again!

121
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,290
I would have lost everything if not for you

122
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,670
You were losing until now

123
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,830
I'll take this as my tip

124
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:41,940
Good-bye!

125
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,670
Stay! Let's play again

126
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,440
No. They always cheat!

127
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,510
You're so big! How come he didn't see you?

128
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,140
Stand still!

129
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,120
Food and wine? New year celebrations?

130
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,720
What do you want?

131
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,410
You should know better than to block my livelihood

132
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,950
I have already given you enough face!

133
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,220
Given me face?

134
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,890
You should know better than

135
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,300
to cross the "Great Bear"!

136
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,730
And, I "Stony Egg" and me, "Iron BulI"

137
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,300
Who cares about you bulI, bear and rotten egg!

138
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,780
This guy is asking for trouble

139
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,840
Stand still!

140
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,210
You'll be sorry if you don't return the money!

141
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,180
Right!

142
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,840
Why should I?

143
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,750
Because of this!

144
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,320
Attack!

145
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,320
That's right!

146
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,950
Grab this!

147
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,190
Give it to me

148
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,430
Smelly!

149
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,300
Take it

150
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:18,370
Grab hold of it

151
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,270
That's great!

152
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,130
Scared!

153
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,340
I'm real scared!

154
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,040
Don't be scared!

155
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,010
Don't be scared! Here I come!

156
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,180
You!

157
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,250
Let's see it then

158
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,600
What are you laughing at?

159
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,740
Here comes an earthquake!

160
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,250
I'm blocking! Left, right and center!

161
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,850
Front and back!

162
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,790
Still blocking?

163
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,360
Let's see you block this!

164
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,230
Had enough?

165
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,760
Amazing!

166
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,470
What's your name?

167
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,730
Stony Egg!

168
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,370
But now you're a broken egg!

169
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,410
Step on you and you'll be a scrambled egg!

170
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,310
One kick and you will be a rolling egg!

171
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:41,340
Sooner or later, you'll be a rotten egg!

172
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,120
Aren't you known as "Iron Head"?

173
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,420
A slap on the back of my head!

174
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,860
Now look at my forehead!

175
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:09,540
Twist your head! Now shrink your head!

176
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,810
Lift your head! Now turn your head!

177
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,090
Off I head!

178
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,810
Rest a while

179
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,310
Squeeze the hell out of you!

180
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,620
You're a big guy with a small brain

181
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,130
He's the "Great Bear" but he's anything but great!

182
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,700
Three? Where's the other one?

183
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,400
Here!

184
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,630
I'm being squeezed to death!

185
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,440
Ah, and so you are!

186
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,110
Do you still want me to return the money?

187
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,250
No! No!

188
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,320
Can I go now?

189
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,080
Of course!

190
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,980
Don't ever follow me again in the future

191
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,320
Yes!

192
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,890
What shall we do?

193
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,650
Let's pulI him up!

194
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,990
Let's go!

195
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,500
- The wine's great! - Yes!

196
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,570
Where'd you get it?

197
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,800
The same shop

198
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,530
but the wine is much better!

199
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,140
There's more of it too

200
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,680
More than a catty!

201
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,410
You're a good boy!

202
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,880
Where did you get the money?

203
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,520
I was Iucky today!

204
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,450
I found a bag fulI of silver!

205
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,560
That's why I bought you all this wine!

206
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,700
That Iucky?

207
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,720
Go out and see if you can find another bag

208
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,090
Tell me the truth!

209
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,570
What?

210
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,040
One became two, two became four

211
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,080
and four became eight!

212
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,380
You were gambling, weren't you?

213
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,580
They tried to stop you from leaving after you won?

214
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,310
Sure they tried to stop me! How did you know?

215
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,820
And then you showed them your kung fu

216
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,520
I didn't!

217
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,090
I merely struck a pose and they let me leave

218
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,160
What pose?

219
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,770
Just the basic one

220
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,670
Disgraceful!

221
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,370
Enjoy your wine! I'll start training!

222
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,300
Forget it

223
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,770
No training today?

224
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,100
I want to train together with you!

225
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,660
- OK, come on - Grandpa!

226
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,190
Everything's fair in love and war!

227
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,660
But I'm your grandson!

228
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,930
Rascal, up to your funny tricks again?

229
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,440
This is called "Short but dangerous"!

230
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,080
I choose the short one then!

231
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,630
Come back! We're not done yet!

232
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:03,340
I missed? This is called "Long but powerful"!

233
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,810
Whatever you say!

234
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,320
I'll take them all

235
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,200
No

236
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,060
Must say you're pretty smart

237
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,170
I get beaten enough!

238
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,080
Grab it, poke it and smack with it

239
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,870
The bee retreats

240
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,810
Fish for it and the phoenix flies!

241
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,950
- Come back! - I'm not through yet!

242
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,050
Blow on the fIute!

243
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:41,710
Hold it!

244
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:42,510
Tail of the tiger!

245
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,380
Tail of the tiger!

246
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,520
My turn to grab the stick!

247
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,850
Where are you going?

248
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:47,820
The tiger's tail!

249
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,490
The tiger's tail!

250
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,460
The three links

251
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,660
sends the birds a-flying!

252
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,820
Open the door with the iron fan!

253
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,030
The iron bulI ploughs!

254
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,530
This technique is known as "Following the tide"!

255
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,740
Here I come! Winds sweep the plum flowers!

256
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,880
Grandpa! Take it easy!

257
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,140
Open the door with the iron fan!

258
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,510
You've broken the door!

259
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,550
Left, right, the fairy strews the flowers!

260
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:19,860
No, Grandpa!

261
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:21,720
Hit you till you go dizzy!

262
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,930
My eyes are bIurry!

263
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,590
Fingers point to heaven and earth!

264
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,630
A knock on the head!

265
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,820
The crocodile hits the boat!

266
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,140
The fisherman casts his net!

267
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,700
Snowflakes on the top! Uproot the old tree

268
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:34,560
The old cow pulIs the mill!

269
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:36,870
The dragonfly leaps!

270
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,730
Leaps...

271
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,170
The bird returns to the forest!

272
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,510
I was too slow

273
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:43,740
Come out!

274
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,650
The swallow returns to its nest

275
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,050
Are you coming out?

276
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,080
OK, a little force may help

277
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,990
I'm coming out

278
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,760
Come on, then!

279
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,320
The rolling gourd!

280
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,890
One becomes two!

281
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,090
And two becomes four!

282
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,200
Grandpa, stop!

283
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,280
Why?

284
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,440
My head's already swollen!

285
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,410
I hop, I step and I jump!

286
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,910
Trying to run? Come back!

287
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,450
It's best to run!

288
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,910
Run where?

289
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,710
Turn and escape!

290
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,820
Embrace the moon!

291
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,950
Advance, turn, stick on the back!

292
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,360
The swallow's jump!

293
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,490
Why don't you start tojump!

294
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,820
I'll just jump right here!

295
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:36,500
Let me help you jump!

296
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,800
The lion shakes its head and here comes the end!

297
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:41,870
What did you say?

298
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,010
End!

299
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,440
End?

300
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,080
Grandpa. Stop or I'll be dead!

301
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,450
How can you learn if I stop!

302
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,250
How many times have I told you

303
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,380
not to reveal our clan's techniques?

304
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,420
Why do you insist on showing it?

305
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,190
Practising our clan's kung fu is not illegal!

306
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,920
You can practise it but you're not to reveal it

307
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,820
If you do, I'll trash you to death

308
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,090
I've had it then

309
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,960
That's why I said

310
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,540
you must look for a properjob

311
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,500
And be an ordinary man!

312
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,380
Rascal

313
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,980
Come, try it!

314
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,740
Mister, you're buying...

315
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,940
What are you so happy about?

316
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,790
Mister, you're buying...

317
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:35,950
Why are you so sad?

318
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,560
Who's suffered a loss? You or me?

319
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,760
Why won't you learn? Come

320
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,560
I'll show you once!

321
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,500
- Come - Yes

322
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:58,380
Mister, death comes when it comes!

323
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,150
Let me handle the funeral!

324
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,690
I guarantee you a grand one!

325
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,120
Remember, we have all kinds of meals here!

326
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,560
Buffet. Table D'Hote, A la Carte!

327
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,630
If someone dressed nicely like me comes in

328
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,460
Recommend this type to him!

329
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,570
If they're dressed like you

330
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,410
take them over here!

331
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,820
This type is meant for the likes of you

332
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,620
How can anyone sleep in this rotting thing?

333
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,550
Why not?

334
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,630
At least three people have used it!

335
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,690
Three people slept in this?

336
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,350
This is what you call "Second Hand"!

337
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,560
What is the meaning of "Second Hand"?

338
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:51,060
It means old stuff!

339
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,640
Do you understand?

340
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,300
Would anybody buy it?

341
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,170
Of course!

342
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,310
I run a monopoly here!

343
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,600
They have no choice but to buy from me!

344
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,040
Is it ethical?

345
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,240
FulI payment only No instalments!

346
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:09,410
AIso, you must remember the various brands

347
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,510
This is teak wood, rose wood

348
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,350
willow wood...

349
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,160
When the guest comes

350
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,390
knock and let them hear the sound

351
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,560
Boss, it sounds like ply wood

352
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,140
They wouldn't know, you dumb ass!

353
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,330
Come!

354
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:34,140
This is the most precious and is not for sale!

355
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,210
Are you keeping it for yourself?

356
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,110
Yes! Ah... Nonsense!

357
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:41,750
But if the price is right, I'm willing to part with it

358
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,580
I polish this thing a few times everyday

359
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,060
It is most important to tell the client its good points!

360
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,890
What good points?

361
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,330
It's cool in the summer and warm in the winter

362
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,830
Even the living will find it comfortable

363
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,670
Covered, it provides shelter from the rain and wind

364
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,600
Won't it be suffocating?

365
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,410
Not if you install

366
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,280
a ventilation fan

367
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,580
Let me show you

368
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:18,320
This coffin is comfortable

369
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:23,520
Nice and cool! So comfortable!

370
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:30,930
Listen! It's as if someone's calling you

371
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,230
This is good wood!

372
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,200
It's scary!

373
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,110
Would you like to try it?

374
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,140
No, thanks! It's too narrow

375
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:46,220
It's big enough for three Try it!

376
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,250
It's terrible!

377
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:57,820
Are you trying to suffocate me, you little rascal?

378
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:02,060
It's only a demo! No one asked you to shut in

379
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,740
I'll kill you when I get out!

380
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,630
I can't lift it!

381
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,600
There's nothing I can do!

382
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,510
Find anything?

383
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,110
No!

384
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,640
Did you find him?

385
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,780
No!

386
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:24,320
Where could he possibly go?

387
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,710
I'm telling you

388
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,740
I don't want any trouble!

389
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:47,900
If you still follow me

390
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,310
I'll break your bones!

391
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:55,790
Big brother!

392
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,460
Hang on, who's your big brother?

393
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,580
We three think you're the greatest

394
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,950
and beg to be your disciples!

395
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:06,890
That's ajoke I can't even take care of myself!

396
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,000
Nobody wants me for anything

397
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:13,100
That's not true! It's just that the times not right

398
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,970
But the time has come now

399
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,200
There's a whole lot of money waiting for you to grab!

400
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:18,900
Right!

401
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,140
Why don't you three go if that's the case?

402
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,440
It's true!

403
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,580
Then, go on!

404
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,950
We can't do it without you

405
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,810
But with you three, I'm as good as dead!

406
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,450
Don't give me any more problems

407
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,390
We won't dare now that we know your kung fu skills

408
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,290
If I've any ill intentions

409
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,460
I'll change my name to rotten egg!

410
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:43,570
And you can break my "Iron Head" anytime!

411
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,600
Besides, you've nothing to do

412
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,140
Come and see our boss

413
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:49,970
Right!

414
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:54,340
OK, I'll see what mischief you're up to this time!

415
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:58,610
I wouldn't dare try any in front of you!

416
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:03,220
What do you think of Tee Char's proposition?

417
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,550
Teacher? Whose your teacher?

418
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,990
I have no teacher

419
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,390
My surname's Tee and my name is Char

420
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,790
Say it quickly

421
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,830
and it sounds the same

422
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,930
It gives my name an air of superiority

423
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,330
I see that you come from Japan

424
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,360
Why do you say that?

425
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,630
You're imitation stuff!

426
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,140
Don't laugh! Gimmicks are important if you want to succeed

427
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,710
Right!

428
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,710
If you can get away with the imitation, why not?

429
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,040
Right!

430
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,250
Come and be the martial art instructor in my school!

431
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,720
I'll pay you a hundred silver taels a month!

432
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,620
And whatever the students bring

433
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,450
I'll share half with you!

434
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,730
AIso, I'll pay you extra every time you fight!

435
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,700
- It's a fair deal, isn't it? - Yes

436
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,030
- A hundred silver taels? - Yes

437
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,600
It's not that I don't want it

438
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,710
I'm only scared of my Grandpa!

439
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,670
He forbids me to show my skills normally

440
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,280
If he finds out that I work for you...

441
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,020
I don't know kung fu but I've a lot of ideas!

442
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:17,200
All you have to do is to use your hands

443
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,390
Leave the rest to me!

444
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,130
How?

445
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:28,670
This will work

446
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,010
Will it?

447
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,970
Sure it'll work!

448
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,200
I'll take you to my school

449
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,850
to look around after Iunch

450
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:39,750
Everything Clan?

451
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,820
What is the meaning of "Everything" Clan?

452
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,580
It means Dragon, Snake, Tiger, Crane, Leopard...

453
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,810
To show we know all types of kung fu

454
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,420
and that we have everything!

455
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,860
I think you've got next to nothing

456
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,120
Right too!

457
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,790
Actually, we only have two students so far

458
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,370
Neither one pays!

459
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,430
Isn't that disgraceful?

460
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,940
That's why it's important to

461
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,170
choose the right name

462
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,080
Right! Can you think of a new name for me?

463
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,940
That won't be easy

464
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,290
What exactly do you teach?

465
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:26,330
The S S S technique!

466
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,530
Is there such a thing?

467
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,170
Of course!

468
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,200
First let me explain what it stands for

469
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,400
The first S means you're smart if you sign up with us

470
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,840
The second S represents the silver you must pay

471
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,440
The third S is for the superb kung fu that we'll be teaching you!

472
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,710
What if I refuse tojoin?

473
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,740
The three S stand for something else then!

474
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,010
The first S means you're stupid not tojoin

475
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:51,420
The second S means we're sorry we wasted time talking to you

476
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,920
The third S means we'll sock you if you don't get out fast

477
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,960
I'll like to see you try!

478
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,620
Hold it! Let me change my clothes first

479
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,460
If you have the guts, wait for me

480
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,630
Take care of him!

481
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,840
Master!

482
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,080
Master!

483
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,680
What is it?

484
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,080
Business at the door

485
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,920
What business?

486
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,830
Take a look first!

487
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,570
He's the bodyguard of the brother!

488
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,930
Him...

489
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,730
Sorry!

490
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,510
I understand he has a school with 40 to 50 students

491
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,340
If we beat him

492
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,280
the students will all come to us!

493
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,510
At 15 taels per student...

494
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:58,080
That'll be 150 for 10!

495
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,660
Right!

496
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,580
15 students will mean 225 taels!

497
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,320
How about 20?

498
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:03,980
Three hundred!

499
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,690
And 30?

500
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,890
That'll be... Let's discuss this later

501
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,230
If you beat him...

502
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,570
It's not that simple!

503
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,760
Look at him!

504
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,030
He's huge and fierce

505
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,700
Just look at his fist!

506
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,470
I won't fight him!

507
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:23,210
But we have a deal. I use my head and you use your hands

508
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:29,580
But to use my hands...

509
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,920
OK, 50!

510
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,020
My hands ache!

511
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:32,820
Sixty!

512
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:33,720
My legs too!

513
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:34,420
Seventy!

514
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,080
My waist aches!

515
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:35,690
Eighty!

516
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,350
Now my head aches!

517
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:37,020
Ninety!

518
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,290
My shoes ache!

519
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,030
Shoes ache? 100!

520
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,470
The aches have stopped! You go out first

521
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,800
Don't kid me now!

522
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,030
I'm not kidding

523
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,140
Damn it!

524
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,800
Is your master coming out or not?

525
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,780
What's the commotion?

526
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,030
I thought you were going to change your clothes

527
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,860
I've thought about it! After all, I'm the Master!

528
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,090
People will say

529
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,700
I'm bullying you if I fight

530
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,530
Nonsense! I'll tear down your school sign

531
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,330
if you give me anymore excuses!

532
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,040
You young impulsive chap!

533
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:27,580
You're really asking for it!

534
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,910
You insist on fighting?

535
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,880
AIright! I'll just send for

536
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,210
my lowliest worker

537
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,820
And let him have some fun with you

538
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,980
Come out!

539
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,830
What are you doing here?

540
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,190
Master!

541
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:52,970
Teach that fellow a lesson!

542
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,770
That fellow?

543
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:59,440
Right! He's should be enough for you

544
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,640
- Go! - Yes...

545
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,120
You want to tear down our sign?

546
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,280
So what?

547
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:18,790
Don't get mad! Have some tea first

548
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:37,940
Come!

549
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,310
Here...

550
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,020
What are you looking at?

551
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,920
Be careful!

552
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,070
It's so painful!

553
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,370
Someone's hurting!

554
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,390
Having fun?

555
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,970
Go to hell!

556
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,820
What are you looking at?

557
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,980
Master, I've taught him a lesson!

558
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,120
Return to your tasks

559
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,350
Yes!

560
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:33,760
Do you admit defeat?

561
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,170
Admit defeat?

562
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,460
Yes!

563
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,940
Will you hand me the protection money now?

564
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,330
Yes!

565
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,270
Will you let me take over your school now?

566
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:47,840
Yes!

567
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:49,810
Leave through the back door!

568
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,110
Yes!

569
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,880
Did you hear that?

570
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,150
Let's go

571
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,190
What are you all looking at?

572
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,920
Take him away!

573
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,360
Yes!

574
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,620
Quick!

575
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,020
Hurry!

576
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:17,670
Hold it!

577
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,910
Get lost! You're in my way

578
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,810
Are you the person who defeated Lu?

579
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,650
That's right!

580
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,220
Are you that good?

581
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:38,530
You are perceptive!

582
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,600
I want to see

583
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:44,560
how good you are!

584
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,970
Without paying fees

585
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:50,970
I won't show you anything!

586
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,040
Right!

587
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,370
Siao San!

588
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:58,480
Siao San...

589
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,210
Why don't you answer me?

590
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,150
That's not my name!

591
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,650
It is now!

592
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,510
There's another one here!

593
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,620
He's small! Should be easy!

594
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,560
How about a discount?

595
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:15,800
Twenty per cent off!

596
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,960
Good! Fight!

597
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,970
What's the name?

598
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,980
"The Willow Knife" Bar Tar!

599
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:30,840
What? Bastard?

600
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,770
Boss...

601
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,540
That's not fair, boss

602
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,280
He has a knife

603
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,220
He's got a knife! No 20% discount!

604
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:44,880
Another 10 then!

605
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,490
Do it yourself!

606
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:49,360
How about it?

607
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,220
Twenty?

608
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,930
Impossible!

609
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:58,930
Lean over

610
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,870
Watch it

611
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:03,600
Duck!

612
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,770
Forty!

613
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:08,570
Forty?

614
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,080
Hurry and up the ante!

615
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,240
Forty maximum!

616
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,140
Forty maximum?

617
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:13,170
How much?

618
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,410
Double it!

619
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,710
Double it?

620
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,690
It's a deal!

621
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,300
This time it's for real!

622
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,110
Follow the tide!

623
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,130
The dragon's tail is right here!

624
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,620
Strike it right!

625
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,170
Lower your head! Lift it! Lower it!

626
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,600
Lift it! Lower it! Lift it!

627
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,110
Lower it! Lift it! Lower it! Lift it!

628
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:48,980
Here...

629
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,610
A little more!

630
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,820
Grab it tighter!

631
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,220
Are you scared?

632
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,100
Wrong side!

633
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,710
Like the smell?

634
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,350
You don't know what's good for you!

635
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,750
Have a few strokes!

636
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:35,990
You're a piece of meat

637
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,860
and I go chop, chop, chop!

638
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:47,070
And then shovel you out of the way!

639
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,800
Left block, right block!

640
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,080
But you can't block your crotch!

641
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,110
This is nojoking matter!

642
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,220
Here comes a long rod!

643
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,850
To give you a prod!

644
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,560
Hit you like a dog!

645
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,560
Still won't give up?

646
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,400
And stir up the shit!

647
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,660
How does that feel?

648
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:24,580
Grab it!

649
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,300
Remember! Don't use knives unnecessarily!

650
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,840
They're messy!

651
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:31,680
Pay your respects to me then!

652
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:32,340
Run for your life!

653
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,510
Yes!

654
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,560
Who is it? It's me, Grandpa

655
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:57,800
Grandpa

656
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,900
Grandpa, feeling better?

657
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,610
Just old age

658
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,710
You must have more rest

659
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,510
I'll get you some tea

660
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,690
Where are you working now?

661
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,490
Same old place!

662
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,460
You must be cautious

663
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:25,630
and leave a good impression!

664
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,030
Have some tea first

665
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,440
Is the job tough?

666
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:35,880
Not at all! Only fight... cleaning up

667
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:38,510
Grandpa, I'll go get your medicine!

668
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:44,950
One at a time

669
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,520
Master!

670
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:49,420
What is it?

671
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:51,390
Big business coming up!

672
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,720
Big business?

673
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,060
Take a look!

674
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:02,400
What's up?

675
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:04,200
Huge fellow!

676
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,540
He's quite big...

677
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,540
I know him. He's...

678
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:12,280
Not as big as me! Smash him like a pumpkin!

679
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:16,010
Not everyone is as dumb as you

680
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:18,150
You go ahead if you want to smash him

681
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,320
Master, you can do it

682
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:22,590
Are you sure?

683
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:23,820
Sure!

684
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,120
Look at you now! You're prosperous!

685
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:27,700
What ?

686
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:32,100
Gold all over! Even your teeth is gold!

687
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:33,070
It's not!

688
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,400
Well, almost! You're big now!

689
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:38,970
You eat the best and wear the best

690
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,770
You look prosperous

691
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,610
But we always risk our lives

692
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,570
We'll soon be dead if we carry on this way

693
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:49,650
If you don't fight him

694
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,020
who's going to pay this month's expenses?

695
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:52,990
That's your business!

696
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:55,690
I'll pay you 500 taels!

697
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:58,790
Promise?

698
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,160
Promise!

699
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:01,800
- Word of honour? - No

700
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:03,400
Word of honour!

701
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:07,960
Don't you know him?

702
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,400
He's a sex maniac

703
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:10,770
Easy!

704
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,610
Get up!

705
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,640
Thanks, Master!

706
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:18,240
Where is he?

707
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,040
Go out first! I'll be right out!

708
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,710
You rascal!

709
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,080
So says the Master!

710
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:31,860
Good moves...

711
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:37,030
Quite good

712
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,690
but nothing compared to ours!

713
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:40,530
Get the fellow out!

714
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:46,930
Control yourself! Be patient even if you want to fight

715
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:48,540
I've no time to waste

716
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,980
You must exercise patience

717
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:55,310
if you want to win

718
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:59,220
Otherwise, you've as good as lost

719
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,220
Damn it all! I'll give you hell!

720
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:13,900
Teach him a lesson!

721
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:16,640
You, you...

722
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:20,240
The Master's not home and I'm to take his place

723
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:25,210
Be careful of that shark!

724
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,410
Sure!

725
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,330
You look so pretty! My mind goes dizzy!

726
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:40,190
You're so big and strong! I'm a little worried!

727
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:40,990
Don't be scared!

728
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:41,890
Scared!

729
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:44,530
Don't you worry!

730
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:46,900
How about a little kiss?

731
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,340
A slap's more like it!

732
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,010
If you don't behave, I'll hit you!

733
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:58,740
Hit all you want!

734
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:01,640
Hit...

735
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:07,150
- It hurts! - Let me soothe you

736
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:08,050
No!

737
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:09,290
Your hands are so big!

738
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:12,430
Big enough to smooth your hair with

739
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,300
If you don't behave, I'll really hit you!

740
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:28,540
So you know kung fu as well?

741
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:30,140
Just a little!

742
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:31,650
Let's have a little fun!

743
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:38,260
You're very rude!

744
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,250
What hairy legs!

745
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:41,890
Isn't that sexy?

746
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,620
And such big feet!

747
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,500
To step on you with! You fool!

748
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:01,440
Wait!

749
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:06,340
Slowly, I roll down the bamboo blinds!

750
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:21,000
And watch my dear fellow lying on the ground!

751
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:25,100
Are you angry?

752
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,060
Naturally!

753
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:38,250
That's great!

754
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,380
I'll love you to death!

755
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,230
Too light! I'll do it myself!

756
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,940
Let me!

757
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,480
He's a guy!

758
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,350
So you're a guy!

759
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:23,560
Strike all the way!

760
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:26,060
One more!

761
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:30,330
That's great!

762
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,500
The money is mine! Bring it over!

763
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:36,540
Great Master!

764
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,390
Speak up! Where is Chen of the Sin-yi clan?

765
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,960
I...

766
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,660
Someone in the village has put up

767
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,960
the Sin-yi School sign!

768
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:49,370
How come there's so much money?

769
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:57,020
Grandpa, don't feel bad if I should be killed one day!

770
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:01,520
This money is to provide for you

771
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,090
Your unfilial grandson

772
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,420
Three in a row!

773
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:34,520
Every technique is superb!

774
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:36,090
Look!

775
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:43,930
That's just the appetizer

776
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:57,970
Watch carefully!

777
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:01,040
One the head! Through the heart!

778
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:02,080
See how obedient he is!

779
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,520
There's more

780
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:08,350
One for the top and one for the bottom!

781
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:10,050
Careful of the roots!

782
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,420
Just a block of wood!

783
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,020
Hit until he gets the cramps!

784
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:18,860
Right! The money will be mine!

785
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:20,900
I'm itching to get the money!

786
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:32,780
Nice?

787
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:55,200
You purposely lost! Are you trying to get another increase?

788
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,710
No more! We made a deal!

789
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:03,640
This time, I don't want anything

790
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:05,380
- Master, you can't leave... - You're leaving

791
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:07,920
Stop! I admit defeat! Get the money from him

792
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,220
Dumb ass!

793
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:12,580
You can't go!

794
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:16,420
That beast asked you to give me the money!

795
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:17,390
I'm as good as dead!

796
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,260
Who were you calling a beast just now?

797
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:21,920
You...

798
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:24,830
I...

799
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,010
Not bad!

800
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:30,700
I'd like to employ you as the instructor here!

801
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,100
No way!

802
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:35,270
This old man knows kung fu!

803
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:36,410
None of your business!

804
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:37,570
Are you alright?

805
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,040
What is it?

806
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,240
How come you're hairy all over?

807
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,940
I'm not hairy!

808
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,150
It's your glasses!

809
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:50,080
Who was that fellow?

810
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:50,850
I don't know!

811
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:51,430
Look for him!

812
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,360
Yes!

813
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:53,190
Find him!

814
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,160
Stand still!

815
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,400
Who are you?

816
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:02,240
I'm looking for my grandson!

817
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:05,070
There are no grandsons here!

818
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:07,240
Who are you?

819
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:11,670
I...I'm the leader here!

820
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:17,550
You even changed the name of your school!

821
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,620
And that's the reason we prospered

822
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:20,480
Where's Master?

823
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:21,220
Where's the Grand Master?

824
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:21,880
Where did he go?

825
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:23,080
Grand Master...

826
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,890
Stop looking!

827
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,630
He ran off long ago!

828
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,560
Who are you?

829
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:37,140
I'm your Grand Master's ancestor!

830
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,550
Lord Chen!

831
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:23,250
At the walled village

832
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:39,700
I've done it now!

833
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:41,170
Grandpa will surely kill me!

834
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,740
Does Chen Peng-fei live here?

835
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:14,400
Rascal!

836
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,380
"Chen Peng-fei"! Isn't that my grandfather?

837
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,450
Chen Peng-fei, you can't run!

838
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,050
I won't run!

839
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:48,930
It's not that you won't run! You can't run!

840
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:50,800
Don't you feel lonely

841
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:52,460
in this deserted place?

842
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:57,740
You've been following me for 10 years!

843
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,440
How could I be lonely?

844
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:03,380
Chen, today you die!

845
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:06,960
I think you better dig your own grave!

846
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,770
Where's your kung fu?

847
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:32,610
Get up!

848
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:52,060
Chen, you've no more strength!

849
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,400
You're sick! Might as well finish you off!

850
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:52,760
You...

851
00:57:57,530 --> 00:57:58,730
Just watch...

852
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:03,440
"Eight legged unicorn"!

853
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:07,940
Where are you going?

854
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:35,470
Grandpa...

855
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:49,550
Grandpa...

856
00:58:55,960 --> 00:59:00,230
If not for you, my grandpa won't be dead!

857
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:06,860
If not for me, you'll be dead!

858
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,200
That's my business!

859
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:13,170
- Get away! - Calm down!

860
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,210
If you didn't go round courting trouble

861
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,740
Your Grandpa wouldn't be dead

862
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:24,190
Grandpa...

863
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:25,650
If you didn't leave a trail...

864
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:27,690
Yen wouldn't have known where he was!

865
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:33,150
Who the hell is Yen anyway?

866
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:36,000
Why did he want to kill Grandpa?

867
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:40,500
Because our clan is the eyesore of the Qing Dynasty!

868
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:45,680
You belong to our clan?

869
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,570
Right! Your grandfather has been looking for this person!

870
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,240
"Eight legged unicorn"!

871
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,490
You're not fit to be my grandpa's friend!

872
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,130
You saw my grandfather being killed and you didn't help!

873
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,300
How could I help?

874
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:15,630
We could unite together and fight Yen!

875
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:21,570
Where are you going?

876
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:23,680
To fight them!

877
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:28,480
Damn!

878
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:32,780
You can't even beat a cripple like me

879
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,180
How can you possibly fight him?

880
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:40,060
If you go, your grandfather's corpse will rot and decay!

881
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:45,960
Grandpa...

882
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:52,060
Stay live and there'll be lots of chances for revenge

883
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,770
I want revenge!

884
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,550
You still have to eat

885
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:05,650
Why aren't you eating?

886
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:08,690
Eat!

887
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:17,270
Don't just take plain rice

888
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:18,900
Have some seaweed

889
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,510
Come on, eat

890
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:31,400
Lung, take a rest!

891
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:35,330
Master, I'm not tired!

892
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:32,380
Master!

893
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:38,670
That's real tough!

894
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:16,970
Come on, continue

895
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:24,980
More strength

896
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,510
PulI...

897
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:45,360
What? No strength?

898
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:47,290
With you on top, how can I pulI it?

899
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:48,900
Well, I'm down now! How about it?

900
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:50,740
I can manage it then!

901
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,040
Painful?

902
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:02,080
Naturally!

903
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,520
That's because you don't know how to Yelp!

904
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:07,820
What do you mean?

905
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:08,920
Yelp!

906
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:11,020
Yelp! It's OK!

907
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:15,230
Yelp! Yelp! Yelp!

908
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,160
OK

909
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:20,360
No more!

910
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:21,470
Why not?

911
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,870
That's enough! Let's go home to eat!

912
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:26,940
What are you up to?

913
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,800
Won't you take one? Yelp! Yelp!

914
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:32,310
Yelp! Yelp!

915
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:45,550
You're normally very happy!

916
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,790
Why that frown today?

917
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:50,600
Too much yelping!

918
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,130
Get up!

919
01:06:57,670 --> 01:06:59,470
- Out of breath? - Yes!

920
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:00,740
Catch your breath then

921
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:12,540
Breathe out! Breathe in! Close your mouth! Swallow it!

922
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:15,960
Hold your breath!

923
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:21,000
Yelp!

924
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,290
That was a bit too late!

925
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:29,040
Yelp!

926
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:33,340
And that's a bit too early!

927
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:37,940
You should do more breathing exercises

928
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,690
Master...

929
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:55,560
I'm here

930
01:07:55,970 --> 01:07:58,400
Such a lot of commotion

931
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:01,000
and you sleep through it like a pig!

932
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:02,870
Who's been here?

933
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:06,700
If someone's been here, you would have had it!

934
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,100
Looks like I'll have to keep one eye open

935
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,370
when I sleep!

936
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,580
Just like this!

937
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:20,650
In training, you must use your brains as well

938
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:23,380
Otherwise, you're only overexerting yourself

939
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:28,500
You've already lost your voice because of it

940
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:32,730
We'll change to another way of training

941
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:34,630
What?

942
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:39,040
I want to test your instinct and reflexes!

943
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,450
See if you can get past that door

944
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:51,650
Go on!

945
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:22,280
Come here!

946
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:25,750
Put your foot down and then get down

947
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:38,900
Again

948
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:48,070
It fell

949
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:48,870
PulI your hand back!

950
01:09:49,410 --> 01:09:50,110
Come again!

951
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:54,950
Comfortable?

952
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:55,980
Comfortable!

953
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:07,590
I'll aim right!

954
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,490
I'm afraid you'll make a mistake!

955
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:14,870
Watch your steps

956
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:15,830
Yes!

957
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:23,710
Waist strength!

958
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:24,670
Enough!

959
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:40,090
I feel faint

960
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:41,460
Come back

961
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:44,890
You slippery fellow!

962
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,130
I'll go!

963
01:10:47,370 --> 01:10:49,740
Oh, my hands!

964
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:51,710
How about your legs?

965
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:53,830
Up! Change! Cross! Hit the legs!

966
01:10:57,410 --> 01:11:02,210
And now legs in the airjust like a dead chicken!

967
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:06,620
You entered the wrong door!

968
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,030
Mind your head!

969
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,160
There's still a window at the back!

970
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:19,690
Right

971
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:21,940
Useless bum!

972
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:56,800
Master! Take it!

973
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,610
Master! Not so bad eh?

974
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:08,080
Not bad! Grab it!

975
01:12:16,630 --> 01:12:17,590
Supporting it

976
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,990
I can't go on...

977
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:22,690
Grab it!

978
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:26,340
But I'm still one up on you!

979
01:12:38,510 --> 01:12:41,210
Lung, I'll go get some wine!

980
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:43,420
There's the door

981
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:54,490
This...

982
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:56,150
I want this...

983
01:12:57,130 --> 01:12:59,330
- You want this? - Yes...

984
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:04,410
- You want this? - Yes, that one...

985
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:08,240
- I want it too - OK!

986
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:11,310
Thank you

987
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:16,810
Master, how come you gave so much?

988
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:19,880
Who are you?

989
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:23,010
Why did you trick me?

990
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:31,420
Your techniques are so vicious! Why?

991
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:37,660
He's a mute and he's crazy!

992
01:14:38,030 --> 01:14:39,470
Let's go!

993
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:59,150
Don't know what's good for you! Bow!

994
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:07,050
What's your grievance?

995
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:08,600
How dare you hit me?

996
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,370
You need the right opponent to fight

997
01:15:22,950 --> 01:15:24,610
You picked the wrong person

998
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:29,710
I think he's really crazy! Give it to him!

999
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:05,080
You must be tired of living!

1000
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,180
I'll help you achieve your aims!

1001
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:17,890
How dare you bite me?

1002
01:16:58,010 --> 01:17:00,130
You crazy fool! Causing trouble everywhere!

1003
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,520
Sorry! He's crazy! Dumb and deaf!

1004
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:13,150
Can't take my eyes off you for a minute!

1005
01:17:29,370 --> 01:17:30,240
Lord, our apologies

1006
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:31,870
if we've offended you!

1007
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,170
If you're his grandpa

1008
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:35,880
you should teach him properly!

1009
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:39,570
Don't let him come out and make trouble

1010
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:43,680
Yes!

1011
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:45,510
Go home, rascal!

1012
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,190
The "Eight legged unicorn"!

1013
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,640
That old man has disappeared!

1014
01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:09,340
He can't get away!

1015
01:18:12,010 --> 01:18:14,310
You're so impulsive!

1016
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:17,120
Fortunately, I came in the nick of time!

1017
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:19,550
If you don't change

1018
01:18:19,790 --> 01:18:21,090
you'll never be able to succeed!

1019
01:18:23,890 --> 01:18:29,630
I'm useless! I'm no good!

1020
01:18:30,030 --> 01:18:32,020
Isn't it a bit late to realize it now?

1021
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,730
You're Iucky that

1022
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:36,270
you're only slightly injured!

1023
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:38,560
Lucky?

1024
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:44,370
Fortunately, you didn't show the techniques of our clan

1025
01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:46,300
He doesn't know

1026
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:49,110
your real identity!

1027
01:18:49,290 --> 01:18:51,880
That's why he wounded you only slightly!

1028
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:55,060
Otherwise

1029
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:56,710
we'll both be dead

1030
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:00,720
I think you know the techniques of our clan well enough!

1031
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,330
I want to teach you another technique!

1032
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:08,400
It will give you a 50-50 chance against Yen!

1033
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:20,640
Only 50-50?

1034
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:22,510
How much did you think you had?

1035
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:26,410
It also depends on how determined you are

1036
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:30,250
But this technique is suited to you

1037
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:34,430
This technique is based on one's emotions

1038
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:39,230
Joy, sadness, melancholy, happiness!

1039
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:44,970
Play on the opponent's emotions

1040
01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:47,870
and affect his judgement!

1041
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:50,980
This may be the technique to beat Yen!

1042
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,810
I'm going to teach you a new technique!

1043
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,610
It's derived from the "Wire" technique!

1044
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:04,660
The basis is to use your brains together with your strength

1045
01:20:04,990 --> 01:20:08,230
Thereby exerting your power to the fullest

1046
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:14,130
And play on your opponent's basic emotions!

1047
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:25,040
"Joy" to subtly evade!

1048
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:43,420
"Anger" to attack as a wild horse!

1049
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:10,690
"Melancholy"- to adhere to the end!

1050
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:28,970
Happiness - to tease!

1051
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,530
Master

1052
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:01,270
Master

1053
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:07,410
Master

1054
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:23,660
"Eight legged unicorn"! I want to see how many legs you really have!

1055
01:22:26,570 --> 01:22:30,100
Stop! How can three of you bully an old man?

1056
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:32,900
Kid, aren't you a mute?

1057
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:35,030
Only the other day!

1058
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:36,800
Normally, I speak better than you!

1059
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:38,070
Brother!

1060
01:22:39,450 --> 01:22:41,080
I can handle him all by myself!

1061
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:44,750
After I'm through with you, you'll really be dumb!

1062
01:22:57,330 --> 01:22:59,890
Beat You!

1063
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,430
I'll knock out all your teeth!

1064
01:23:03,610 --> 01:23:04,660
You...

1065
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:18,480
In that outfit, what are you swaggering about?

1066
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:20,120
Weapons!

1067
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:21,920
Weapons!

1068
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:24,250
Go to hell!

1069
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:42,710
Even with weapons, you can't do it

1070
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:23,940
Let me see if you're still vicious!

1071
01:24:24,150 --> 01:24:25,850
You're better!

1072
01:24:27,790 --> 01:24:28,810
I can do it

1073
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:44,960
Go to hell!

1074
01:26:19,570 --> 01:26:20,190
Get that!

1075
01:26:29,110 --> 01:26:30,340
You stupid fellow!

1076
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:53,230
Don't come over!

1077
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:55,100
Watch that old fellow!

1078
01:26:57,410 --> 01:26:58,960
Don't come over! Otherwise, I'll kill him

1079
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,100
Lung! Don't worry about me!

1080
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:03,770
Hand that to me!

1081
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:11,010
Kill him if you wish!

1082
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:12,950
Might as well

1083
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,390
let him die a matyr!

1084
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,250
It's better that staying alive as a cripple!

1085
01:27:18,430 --> 01:27:19,990
Go ahead and kill him!

1086
01:27:23,930 --> 01:27:26,400
Master, don't worry! I'll take care of you!

1087
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,930
Just how much is your life worth?

1088
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:36,840
We...

1089
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:41,010
You're all useless! Can't do anything right!

1090
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:43,880
OId man...

1091
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:09,170
Stop your pretence! Who exactly are you?

1092
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:14,070
The person to avenge the death of Chen Peng-fei!

1093
01:28:17,890 --> 01:28:18,820
What's your connection to the eight-legged unicorn?

1094
01:28:18,990 --> 01:28:19,720
Damn!

1095
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:33,290
I want to exterminate you once and for all!

1096
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:36,030
Not that easy!

1097
01:28:54,090 --> 01:28:55,320
I want to skin you alive!

1098
01:28:57,830 --> 01:29:01,020
Get up!

1099
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:13,170
I think you've had it! You're out of breath!

1100
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,610
Steady now!

1101
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:22,370
Right! Steady and take control!

1102
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:28,260
I must get my second wind...

1103
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:37,990
Second wind...

1104
01:30:05,190 --> 01:30:06,820
Still laughing?

1105
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:19,830
You're crying!

1106
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:43,380
You can't lean on me for life!

1107
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:50,510
Yelp!

1108
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:53,590
Yelp!

1109
01:32:55,130 --> 01:32:55,690
Yelp!

1110
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:27,820
Yelp!

1111
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:14,670
Not "ya"! It's "yelp"!

1112
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:33,290
I won't even let you yelp!

1113
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:48,970
Yelp!

1114
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:41,280
Grandpa!

1114
01:36:42,305 --> 01:37:42,424

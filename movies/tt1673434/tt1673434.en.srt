1
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,800
So beautiful.

2
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,250
We're the same temperature now.

3
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,060
Hey, Bella,

4
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,540
you're a lot stronger than I am right now.

5
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,510
It's your turn not to break me.

6
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,460
I love you.

7
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,190
I love you.

8
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,290
Renesmee.

9
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,540
She's incredible.

10
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,440
Wait. Wait.

11
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,900
You need to get your thirst under control.

12
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,880
Yeah, you'll need to hunt.

13
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:55,780
Close your eyes.

14
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,890
I'm sorry, I didn't realize

15
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,060
there'd be people this far from the trails.

16
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,370
I have to get outta here.

17
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,270
Okay, I can help you.

18
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,280
Or not.

19
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,410
Well, I'm amazed.

20
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,460
You ran away from human blood mid-hunt.

21
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,610
Even mature vampires have problems with that.

22
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,040
You're still here.

23
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,500
So are you.

24
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,550
I didn't expect you to seem so... you

25
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,750
Except for the creepy eyes.

26
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,080
I would keep my distance for now.

27
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,530
It's safer for the baby to see how you do with me first.

28
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,810
All right.

29
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,320
Take a whiff.

30
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,060
Well, I can see what everyone's been talking about.

31
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,130
Jake, you really do stink.

32
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,810
You guys

33
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,940
really look great together.

34
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,090
Welcome to the family.

35
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,190
You look amazing, Bella.

36
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,470
Someone's been waiting to meet you.

37
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,730
Rose.

38
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,490
Beautiful.

39
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,880
She showed you the first memory she has of you.

40
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,640
She's gifted.

41
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,810
Her growth rate is unprecedented.

42
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,380
All right. That's enough experimenting for one day.

43
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,050
Jacob.

44
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,980
She's doing great.

45
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,290
Yeah. Let's not push it though.

46
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,190
Do tell her, Jacob.

47
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,590
This should be good.

48
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,420
Hold on a second.

49
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,380
Bella.

50
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,630
Look, it's a wolf thing.

51
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,070
You know we have no control over it.

52
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,480
We can't choose who it happens with.

53
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,640
And it doesn't mean what you think, Bella. I promise.

54
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,430
Take Renesmee out of the room.

55
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:40,920
Edward, don't touch me right now.

56
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,130
I don't want to hurt you.

57
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,170
It's not like that.

58
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,540
I'm still debating it.

59
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,790
And already you think that you have some moronic

60
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,520
It's fine, Leah.

61
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,280
You're gonna stay away from her.

62
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,960
You know I can't do that.

63
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,050
Stop her, Edward.

64
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,150
He said it's fine.

65
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,070
Long gone.

66
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,090
Because it was her.

67
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,470
From the beginning it was Nessie who wanted me there.

68
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,150
Seth, I'm sorry.

69
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,090
He'll be all right.

70
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,880
Bella,

71
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,280
you know me better than anyone.

72
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,770
All I want is for Ness...

73
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,280
Renesmee to be safe. Happy.

74
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,140
Look, nothing ever made sense before.

75
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,040
You. Me. Any of it.

76
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,430
And now I understand why. This was the reason.

77
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,000
Finally.

78
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,450
My turn.

79
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,960
In my arms, or Edward's or Esme's.

80
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,760
Happy birthday.

81
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,190
I stopped aging three days ago.

82
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,910
Well, we're celebrating anyway. So suck it up.

83
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,160
I still hate surprises. That hasn't changed.

84
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,060
You'll love this one.

85
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,380
We thought you guys might like a place of your own.

86
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,810
I think it's perfect.

87
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,250
Go inside.

88
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,370
Have fun.

89
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,250
This will be Renesmee's room.

90
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,300
Closet.

91
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,390
Alice stocked it for you.

92
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,960
Clearly.

93
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,480
This is our room.

94
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,780
Vampires don't sleep.

95
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,390
It's not intended for sleep.

96
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,220
You really were holding back before.

97
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,950
I'm never gonna get enough of this.

98
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,860
We don't get tired.

99
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,830
We don't have to rest or catch our breath or eat.

100
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,700
I mean,

101
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,190
Rosalie and Emmett were so bad, it took a solid decade

102
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:21,190
before we could stand to be within five miles of them.

103
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,310
I think we might be worse.

104
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,890
Definitely worse.

105
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,330
Blondie stole her.

106
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,160
Emmett. No.

107
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,050
He's been calling twice a day.

108
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,530
He's in pretty rough shape.

109
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,700
Eventually, we'll have to tell him you didn't make it.

110
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,710
He needs to mourn, Bella.

111
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,780
Okay. We'll do it tomorrow.

112
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,080
I'm gonna miss this place.

113
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,640
We'll come back. We always do.

114
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:45,580
Wait.

115
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,000
Nobody said anything about leaving.

116
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,290
Once people believe Bella's dead,

117
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,760
we can't risk anyone seeing her.

118
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,410
Jacob, we don't have another choice.

119
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,300
Charlie,

120
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,040
Bella is...

121
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,450
No, she's not.

122
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,340
No, no, no, I mean, she's fine.

123
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,050
She's back home and

124
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,390
she's feeling better.

125
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:07,960
Wait.

126
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,380
There's something you need to see first.

127
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,150
I need to see Bella.

128
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:18,510
Look, in order for Bella to get better, she had to

129
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,080
change.

130
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,640
Here goes nothing.

131
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,880
You don't live in the world you think you do.

132
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,580
Jacob, put your clothes on.

133
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,090
Now, this may seem strange.

134
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,140
Really strange. But...

135
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,740
...stranger things happen every day. Trust me.

136
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,250
Look, I solved a problem.

137
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,610
You were leaving.

138
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,340
You don't realize the danger you've put him in.

139
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,780
The Volturi will kill anyone who knows about us.

140
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,290
No, I didn't tell him about you. Just me.

141
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,780
I only said you were different.

142
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,950
And that we have a niece who we adopted.

143
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,590
I mean, seriously, Jake, he's not just gonna let that go.

144
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,830
It'll be like sticking a white hot branding iron down her throat.

145
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,430
And that's assuming she can control her thirst.

146
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,240
Look, Charlie's been in hell.

147
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,900
And I know you'll be much happier with him in your life.

148
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,040
Jacob, don't try and pretend

149
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,690
you're doing this for anyone but yourself.

150
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,950
Sorry you feel that way

151
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,660
because he'll be here in 10 minutes.

152
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,570
These will irritate your eyes at first.

153
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,920
The main thing is not to move too fast.

154
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,840
Try taking a seat. Crossing your legs.

155
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,960
Maybe a tad slower. Hmm.

156
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,630
And blink at least three times a minute.

157
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,170
Good.

158
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,350
For a cartoon character.

159
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,850
Hold your breath. It will help with the thirst.

160
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,440
Just don't forget to move your shoulders

161
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,730
so it looks like you're breathing.

162
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,660
And don't sit so straight.

163
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,300
Humans don't do that.

164
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,170
Okay. I got it.

165
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,200
Move around, blink, slouch.

166
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,090
Good luck.

167
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,070
Hello, Charlie.

168
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,200
Bella.

169
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,450
Hi, Dad.

170
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,020
Never better.

171
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,890
Healthy as a horse.

172
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,660
She wishes she was that awesome.

173
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,160
Let's give them some privacy.

174
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,370
Uh, Jake said that this...

175
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,050
This was necessary.

176
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,720
I really think it would be better...

177
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,370
I wanna know what happened to you.

178
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,460
I can't tell you.

179
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,970
I think I deserve an explanation.

180
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,500
You do.

181
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,080
But if you really need one, I can't stay here.

182
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:02,020
Dad, you're just gonna have to trust that for whatever reason,

183
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:03,950
I'm all right.

184
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,710
I'm more than all right.

185
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,070
Well, I don't know, Bella.

186
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,270
I mean, I just watched a kid I've known his entire life

187
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,100
turn into a very large dog.

188
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,040
My daughter looks like my daughter,

189
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,200
but doesn't.

190
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,660
Can you please just believe

191
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,080
No.

192
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,220
Really, you don't.

193
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,720
Not gonna lose you again.

194
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,340
I can't.

195
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,880
Then you won't.

196
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,530
I promise.

197
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,800
I missed you, Bells.

198
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,780
So much.

199
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,610
I missed you, Dad.

200
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,850
Charlie.

201
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,430
This is Renesmee.

202
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,970
Our daughter.

203
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,190
Right.

204
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,040
The adoption.

205
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,100
She's got your eyes, Bella.

206
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,150
Need to know, I guess.

207
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,830
Well done, Bella.

208
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,410
Never seen a newborn show that kind of restraint.

209
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,410
I'm not sure she is a newborn.

210
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,230
She's so tame.

211
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,370
Emmett, don't antagonize her.

212
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,840
She's the strongest one in the house.

213
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,230
Please.

214
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,510
Don't hurt yourself, Emmett.

215
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,910
All right. On 3.

216
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,060
1,

217
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,370
2,

218
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,210
Thank you.

219
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,050
My time as a human was over.

220
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,750
But I never felt more alive.

221
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,450
I was born to be a vampire.

222
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,230
Everything was falling into place.

223
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,250
Even the Volturi seemed to accept my new status.

224
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,590
It seemed we had only one enemy left.

225
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:36,360
Time.

226
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,970
Renesmee was growing too fast.

227
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:47,020
We all worried about how long we would have with her.

228
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,970
It just made every moment more precious.

229
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,810
Look, a snowflake.

230
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,700
It's beautiful.

231
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,190
Edward thinks that we'll find answers in Brazil.

232
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,690
There are tribes there that might know something.

233
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,200
I think that's our cousin from Denali.

234
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,260
Tanya convinced Irina to come reconcile with us.

235
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,030
It looks like she changed her mind.

236
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,480
Seeing Jacob must have been too much for her.

237
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,430
Wish I could have just spoken to her.

238
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,950
She's family. She'll come around.

239
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,660
What a pleasant surprise.

240
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,320
I have to report a crime.

241
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,730
The Cullens...

242
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:43,050
They've done something terrible.

243
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,510
Allow me, my dear.

244
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,820
Oh, my.

245
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:44,030
The Volturi.

246
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,170
They're coming for us.

247
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:51,900
Aro, Caius, Marcus, the Guard.

248
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,330
And Irina.

249
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,440
Honey, come here.

250
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:00,650
We were just walking.

251
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,050
Ness was catching snowflakes.

252
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,050
Of course.

253
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,040
Irina thinks Renesmee's an immortal Child.

254
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,340
The immortal Children were very beautiful.

255
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,710
So enchanting.

256
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,860
To be near them was to love them.

257
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:25,720
But their development was frozen at the age they were turned.

258
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,720
They couldn't be taught or restrained.

259
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,770
A single tantrum could destroy an entire village.

260
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,370
Humans heard about the devastation.

261
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:43,800
Stories spread.

262
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,380
The Volturi were forced to intervene.

263
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,900
Since the Children couldn't protect our secret,

264
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,310
they had to be destroyed.

265
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:13,690
Their creators grew very attached and fought to protect them.

266
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,370
Long-established covens were torn apart.

267
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,840
Countless humans slaughtered.

268
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,290
Traditions, friends,

269
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,310
even families, lost.

270
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:41,730
Yes.

271
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,210
And she paid the price.

272
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,990
Well, Renesmee's nothing like those children.

273
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,340
She was born, not bitten. She grows every single day.

274
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:18,050
Aro has enough proof in Irina's thoughts.

275
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,070
So we fight.

276
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,500
Their offensive weapons are too powerful.

277
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,600
No one can stand against Jane.

278
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,650
Alec's even worse.

279
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,660
Well, then we convince them.

280
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,940
They're coming to kill us, not to talk.

281
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,750
No, you're right.

282
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,850
They won't listen to us.

283
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,040
But maybe others can convince them.

284
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,670
Carlisle, you have friends all around the world.

285
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,360
I won't ask them to fight.

286
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,060
Not fight. Witness.

287
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,080
If enough people knew the truth,

288
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,370
maybe we could convince the Volturi to listen.

289
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,910
We can ask this of our friends.

290
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:09,910
At least we get to go to London again.

291
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,870
We haven't been there in a long time.

292
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:16,480
All right. Let's get this show on the road.

293
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,750
Alice asked me to give you that.

294
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,260
She and Jasper crossed our lands to the ocean last night.

295
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,770
They've left us.

296
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,280
She didn't say.

297
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,790
Gather as many witnesses as you can

298
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,020
before the snow sticks to the ground.

299
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:50,850
That's when they'll come.

300
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:57,480
Alice's instructions were clear, but the question remained.

301
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,350
Our search for witnesses began

302
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,400
with a trip north to our closest relatives.

303
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:54,550
Not directly.

304
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,190
I can smell him from here.

305
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,300
My family is in danger. I need your help.

306
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,240
It's hard to explain

307
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,430
Of course.

308
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:15,890
Okay.

309
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,290
Time to meet some new people.

310
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,940
- They'll love you. - They will.

311
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,460
Once they understand you.

312
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,910
They just haven't met anyone like you before.

313
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:31,370
Okay.

314
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,670
The Volturi will come for all of us.

315
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,390
You get that thing out of here.

316
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,570
She's not what she looks like.

317
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,310
She has blood in her veins.

318
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,220
You can feel her warmth.

319
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:05,590
I can feel it.

320
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,650
I'm her biological father.

321
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,860
- Bella is her mother. - Impossible.

322
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,620
It's true. She was born while I was still human.

323
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,190
I've never heard of such a thing.

324
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,430
She can show you, if you let her.

325
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,380
Tanya, you owe us this much.

326
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,560
We're all under a death sentence

327
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,230
because your sister didn't let us explain.

328
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,440
Don't be afraid.

329
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,980
This is how she communicates.

330
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:54,480
It's true.

331
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,470
She's not immortal.

332
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,320
I knew the rest of our family would face this fear as well.

333
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,000
Fear of the unknown.

334
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,550
Fear of the Volturi.

335
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,490
I cannot help you, Carlisle.

336
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,870
I wouldn't ask if it weren't urgent.

337
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,090
You must go.

338
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,160
I'd like to hear about it.

339
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,040
I never get to meet any of Amun's friends.

340
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,650
He likes to keep me hidden.

341
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,010
I can't imagine why.

342
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,450
- Carlisle. - Benjamin.

343
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,920
Benjamin can influence the elements.

344
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,560
And here I get super self-control.

345
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,510
Senna and Zafrina.

346
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,000
From the Amazon.

347
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:17,820
The arrival of Senna and Zafrina

348
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,220
meant that our plea was being heard

349
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,910
in even the most remote corners of the world

350
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,330
while others searched for witnesses closer to home.

351
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,030
A patriot Carlisle first met on the battlefield at Yorktown

352
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:34,030
would become our most unlikely ally.

353
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,050
I hated the first British invasion.

354
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:47,030
And I hate the second one even more.

355
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,870
Old habits die hard.

356
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,240
Carlisle needs you.

357
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,360
Sounds interesting.

358
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:04,370
But first I'd better finish my meal.

359
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,030
Each of them was won over.

360
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:18,840
Each was made to see.

361
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:27,510
Carlisle convinced his Irish friends

362
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:28,920
to make the journey to Forks.

363
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,850
Although we were grateful for their help,

364
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,750
their thirst for human blood complicated the situation.

365
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,620
The nomads Rosalie and Emmett sent were even more unpredictable.

366
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:47,550
Especially Peter,

367
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:50,030
who had fought alongside Jasper as a newborn.

368
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,880
Lotta red eyes around here.

369
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:55,930
They agreed not to hunt in the area.

370
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:00,420
But they'll feed somewhere.

371
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,500
As more vampires set foot in their territory,

372
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,910
more Quileutes turned.

373
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,180
Their nature compelling them to join the pack.

374
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:15,830
It's all right.

375
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,730
You're gonna be okay.

376
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:24,830
Finally, Carlisle and Esme returned with our last witness.

377
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,230
You have some good friends.

378
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:37,780
We'll all be on Aro's list now.

379
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,350
Centuries on the run. That's what you've brought me.

380
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:42,610
Some friend, Carlisle.

381
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:44,710
Alistair, come meet everyone.

382
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:46,510
I already told you, if it comes to a fight,

383
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:48,100
I won't stand against the Volturi.

384
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,590
It won't come to a fight.

385
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:52,730
I'll be in the attic.

386
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,190
He's not a people person.

387
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:07,420
We opened our home to 18 vampires.

388
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:09,370
Many with gifts of their own.

389
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,400
Zafrina had power over the mind.

390
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:17,580
She could make anyone see what she wanted them to.

391
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,800
If she weren't holding my hand right now,

392
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,830
I could swear this was real.

393
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,260
I don't see anything.

394
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,880
Edward, you didn't tell me your wife is a shield.

395
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:01,170
The ones I've met are so different.

396
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:03,310
It's a defensive talent.

397
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:06,330
It's why I couldn't read your mind, even before.

398
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,710
It's why Aro couldn't.

399
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,680
You have a very powerful gift.

400
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:12,970
Oh, yeah, she's a shield, all right.

401
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,800
Shoulda put her on her ass.

402
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,180
Or your voltage has been exaggerated.

403
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:19,610
Maybe it only works on the weak.

404
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:25,000
Garrett, I wouldn't.

405
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:34,560
You are an amazing woman.

406
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,640
Now, you guys can do some serious damage.

407
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,640
Which is why you'll need to control your phasing.

408
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:45,500
If your mom pisses you off,

409
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:47,610
you don't want to tear her head off.

410
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:59,390
Whoever's coming wasn't invited.

411
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:54,140
Vladimir, Stefan,

412
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:56,220
you're a long way from home.

413
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:00,440
We heard the Volturi were moving against you.

414
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:02,740
But that you would not stand alone.

415
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:04,820
We didn't do what we were accused of.

416
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:07,430
We do not care what you did, Carlisle.

417
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:09,680
We have been waiting a millennium

418
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:13,870
for the Italian scum to be challenged.

419
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,640
It's not our plan to fight the Volturi.

420
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:17,650
Shame.

421
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,310
Aro's witnesses will be so disappointed.

422
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,170
They enjoy a good fight.

423
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:35,070
When Aro wants someone from a coven

424
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:37,210
it's never long before evidence turns up

425
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,320
proving that coven committed some crime.

426
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:44,260
It happens so rarely, I never realized it was a pattern.

427
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:45,650
Apparently he always pardons

428
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:48,130
one person whose thoughts he claims are repentant.

429
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:50,220
This person always has an ability.

430
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,760
And they're always given a place with the Guard.

431
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:54,350
This is all about Alice.

432
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:57,420
- He has no one like her. - Which is why she left.

433
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:01,280
To spread the word that justice has been served,

434
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:04,590
after he slaughters an entire coven.

435
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:10,320
Benjamin, Tia,

436
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,270
Or Zafrina or Kate

437
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:22,530
Their goal isn't punishment.

438
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:24,050
It's power. It's acquisition.

439
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,040
Carlisle might not ask you to fight, but I will.

440
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,410
For the sake of my family. But also for yours.

441
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:32,820
And for the way you want to live.

442
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:42,690
The packs will fight.

443
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,570
We've never been afraid of vampires.

444
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:48,630
We will fight.

445
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:52,220
This won't be the first time I fought a king's rule.

446
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:54,580
We'll join you.

447
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,350
No.

448
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,890
I will do the right thing, Amun.

449
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,830
You may do as you please.

450
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:05,360
We will stand with you.

451
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:06,750
So will we.

452
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:12,960
That didn't take much.

453
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,540
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

454
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:17,320
We'll see.

455
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:28,240
Everyone showed courage.

456
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:31,490
Though we knew that Aro's army was moving against us.

457
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:35,320
Soon we would face the dark gifts of Jane.

458
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:38,310
And worse, the paralyzing vapor of her brother Alec,

459
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,310
who could rob you of sight, sound and touch.

460
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,440
I will never go against you.

461
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,300
Of course not,

462
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:40,640
my dear Toshiro.

463
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:02,550
It seems Carlisle is still expecting you.

464
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:15,110
Carlisle is all but ensuring his own destruction.

465
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:17,670
Sad,

466
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:23,860
Aro will want us incapacitated before he attacks.

467
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:26,080
Jane and Alec will try and take me out first

468
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,620
because I can anticipate their moves.

469
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,650
Too bad we don't all have your shield.

470
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,550
Doesn't help me fight, though.

471
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:33,150
No, but you could help the rest of us,

472
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:34,400
if you could project it.

473
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:37,370
I mean shield someone other than yourself.

474
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,340
Gifts can be developed, over time.

475
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:42,650
At first, mine was just in my palms.

476
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:44,900
Now I can radiate it all over my body.

477
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:48,430
Tell me.

478
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,520
You need to visualize it.

479
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,570
See how it moves.

480
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:58,480
What color it is.

481
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,560
Now picture it expanding.

482
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,860
Will it to go beyond you.

483
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:19,940
I think she needs something to motivate her.

484
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:28,280
- No. - It's all right, I can take it.

485
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,720
He says that now.

486
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,270
Focus, Bella, or he's gonna be hurting.

487
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:36,710
Edward, I'm not ready to do this yet.

488
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,150
I'm sorry. I said that I wasn't ready.

489
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:42,140
Dude, you're not motivating her.

490
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:57,750
You seem to lack incentive.

491
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:03,260
All right.

492
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,120
This one's on full power.

493
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:41,720
It's painful, but it's bearable.

494
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:49,490
Okay, we should go again.

495
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:51,310
Emmett.

496
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:53,810
I'm good.

497
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:57,520
There's sweet music here that softer falls

498
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,750
Than petals from blown roses on the grass.

499
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:05,050
Or night dews on still waters between walls

500
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,340
Of shadowy granite in a gleaming pass.

501
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:15,160
Music that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful skies.

502
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,160
Mom.

503
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:34,860
Did Aunt Alice and Uncle Jasper run away

504
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:43,440
No.

505
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:49,710
I think they left to keep us safer.

506
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:52,840
That's what all these other people are here for, too.

507
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,980
I'll never let anybody hurt you.

508
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:05,070
Come here. Go to sleep.

509
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:26,640
It's strange.

510
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:30,560
Physically, I feel like I could demolish a tank.

511
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,000
Mentally, I just feel drained.

512
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:01,790
I do remember how to undress myself.

513
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,330
Yeah, I just do it so much better.

514
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:13,250
Bella,

515
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:18,640
I've had a bad habit of underestimating you.

516
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,890
Every obstacle you've faced,

517
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:27,390
I'd think you couldn't overcome it.

518
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:31,090
And you just did.

519
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:34,780
You're the reason they have something to fight for.

520
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,030
My family.

521
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,840
I'm gonna get the water running.

522
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,290
Alice made sure only I would get the message.

523
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,990
Because only my mind would be safe from Aro.

524
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:46,200
I'm surprised you took a break from Jedi training.

525
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:48,770
If I don't take Renesmee to my dad,

526
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:50,070
he'll come to us.

527
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:53,450
27 vampires, one human.

528
01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:55,480
Not so great.

529
01:00:56,910 --> 01:00:58,500
I know that's what you told Edward.

530
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:04,500
Whatever.

531
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:08,520
I'm just glad to get away from all those reeking bloodsuckers.

532
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:12,790
I'm sorry.

533
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,460
I know.

534
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:16,460
They're the good guys.

535
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:19,240
But come on,

536
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:21,700
Dracula One and Two are

537
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:26,490
creepy.

538
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:41,750
There she is. Come here.

539
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,020
Seriously.

540
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:50,940
Like 6 inches.

541
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:54,020
Come on inside. Lunch is on the table.

542
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,760
I've actually got a few errands to run, guys.

543
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:03,230
Come on. Let's go.

544
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:13,780
Alice's note gave me a new sense of hope.

545
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:16,760
Maybe she had a plan for us after all.

546
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:19,720
And maybe J. Jenks was the key.

547
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,050
- I'm meeting Mr. Jenks. - Right this way.

548
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:50,190
- Mrs. Cullen. - Hi.

549
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,200
I'm so happy you called.

550
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,310
I always meet my private clients here.

551
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:10,310
It's more comfortable than the office.

552
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:12,450
And it's more public.

553
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:18,340
Oh, you know, this and that.

554
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:21,980
It's always different, which keeps it interesting.

555
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:30,280
I've been working with them for more than 20 years.

556
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:34,310
And my late partner knew Jasper 15 years before that.

557
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:35,880
He is, uh,

558
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:39,220
unusually well-preserved.

559
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:42,590
Yes, he is.

560
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,150
I trust that Mr. Jasper is enjoying his vacation.

561
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:57,050
No, no, no, he just mentioned that he was leaving

562
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:58,920
when he came by to place his order.

563
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:04,450
Of course.

564
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:06,970
I've never been late with a delivery.

565
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:31,150
No.

566
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:36,710
My husband and I thought that we'd all be traveling together.

567
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:38,600
Jasper said only two were traveling.

568
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:40,570
His instructions were very clear.

569
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:41,640
It's my mistake.

570
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:46,540
Apparently, that's not going to happen.

571
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,480
Alice's vision was clear.

572
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:15,620
Renesmee would have a future.

573
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,480
But Edward and I wouldn't be a part of it.

574
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:48,510
My dearest Renesmee,

575
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,140
I thought we would have forever together.

576
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:53,850
But forever isn't as long as I'd hoped.

577
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,200
I know now why Alice left me clues.

578
01:05:58,010 --> 01:05:59,070
It was to keep you safe.

579
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,340
Everything you and Jacob will need is in this pack.

580
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:06,500
Jacob will protect you.

581
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:09,430
And he'll help you learn about the Ticuna legends.

582
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:18,370
That a righteous few can defy a great evil.

583
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:23,470
I must admit, you even had me believing.

584
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:24,990
For a moment.

585
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:30,390
Well, good luck. You're gonna need it.

586
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:35,900
Cheers.

587
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:47,270
The snow is sticking.

588
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:49,550
Hey, we still have today.

589
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,470
I'm so glad Charlie found somebody to take care of him.

590
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,700
Bella, no one's giving up here.

591
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,320
Seth, Leah, stop eating.

592
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,730
Jake, you start. Get it going.

593
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:18,570
Well, Dad, we didn't have time to wrap yours,

594
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:19,610
but here it is.

595
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:27,690
It's a 5-day fishing trip to Fraser River.

596
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:29,180
It's for you and Sue.

597
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:30,910
You leave tomorrow.

598
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,960
Wow, that's really nice. Thank you.

599
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,810
I made arrangements for you at work.

600
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:40,290
Sneaky.

601
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:43,650
And extravagant.

602
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:46,150
And non-refundable, I'm afraid.

603
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:57,930
Fraser River. That means we'll be chasing cutthroat.

604
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:00,570
We might even hook a rainbow or some bulls.

605
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:03,270
Woman knows her trout.

606
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:06,240
Hey, beautiful. Let me see.

607
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:17,710
It's so pretty.

608
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:19,840
It is really pretty.

609
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,560
That's what I'm talkin' about.

610
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,710
A little pre-battle bonfire,

611
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:50,800
telling war stories,

612
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,530
or just standing there like frickin' statues.

613
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:02,260
Name any American battle. I was there.

614
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,120
Little Bighorn.

615
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,290
I came this close to biting Custer.

616
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:12,300
But the Indians got him first.

617
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:16,400
Try Oleg's assault on Constantinople.

618
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:18,610
He didn't win that one on his own.

619
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:20,010
If you're talking battles,

620
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:21,660
you're talking the Eleven Years' War.

621
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:24,710
No one does rebellion like the Irish.

622
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:26,620
You lost the Eleven Years' War.

623
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,330
Aye. But it was one hell of a rebellion.

624
01:09:30,690 --> 01:09:33,110
When we ruled, everything came to us.

625
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:33,950
Prey,

626
01:09:34,690 --> 01:09:35,720
diplomats,

627
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:37,150
favor seekers.

628
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:39,900
Such was our power.

629
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:44,230
But we never put on white hats and called ourselves saints.

630
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:47,880
We were honest about what we were.

631
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:51,220
We sat still for a very long time.

632
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:55,120
We didn't notice we were beginning to petrify.

633
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,830
Perhaps the Volturi did us a favor

634
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:03,080
when they burned our castles.

635
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:06,630
We've been waiting 1,500 years

636
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:08,850
to return that favor.

637
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:14,600
We have been ready to do battle for ages.

638
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:17,480
I can't help thinking,

639
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:19,600
all these people are putting themselves in danger

640
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,020
because I fell in love with a human.

641
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:22,580
You found your mate.

642
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:24,130
You deserve to be happy.

643
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:28,720
Everyone here has something to fight for.

644
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:30,310
I certainly do.

645
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:43,560
Carlisle, I've never thanked you

646
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:48,190
for this extraordinary life.

647
01:11:06,990 --> 01:11:08,570
This means "More than my own life."

648
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:10,050
That's how much I love you.

649
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:13,640
Tomorrow I'm gonna need you to stay with Jacob.

650
01:11:15,650 --> 01:11:16,430
No matter what.

651
01:11:18,370 --> 01:11:19,590
Even if I tell him that...

652
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,270
that he has to take you somewhere.

653
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:28,960
Baby, it's all right.

654
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:31,880
You're gonna be safe.

655
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:36,500
Always.

656
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:24,080
If we live through this,

657
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:27,490
I'll follow you anywhere, woman.

658
01:12:31,190 --> 01:12:32,200
Now you tell me.

659
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,000
Aro's looking for Alice.

660
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:28,220
Aro,

661
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:30,650
let us discuss things as we used to.

662
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:32,380
In a civilized manner.

663
01:14:32,850 --> 01:14:34,580
Fair words, Carlisle.

664
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:37,040
But a little out of place,

665
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:40,130
given the battalion you've assembled against us.

666
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:43,170
I can promise you, that was never my intent.

667
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:45,560
No laws have been broken.

668
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,240
We see the child.

669
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:49,750
Do not treat us as fools.

670
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:56,500
These witnesses can attest to that.

671
01:14:58,110 --> 01:14:59,140
Or you can look.

672
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:02,710
See the flush of human blood in her cheeks.

673
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:07,440
I will collect every facet of the truth.

674
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:11,690
But from someone more central to the story.

675
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:13,830
Edward,

676
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,250
as the child clings to your newborn mate,

677
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:22,970
I assume you are involved.

678
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:38,350
I'd like to meet her.

679
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:35,920
Young Bella.

680
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:40,280
Immortality becomes you.

681
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:51,270
I hear her strange heart.

682
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:13,030
Hello, Aro.

683
01:18:38,910 --> 01:18:43,150
Half mortal, half immortal.

684
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:51,740
Conceived and carried by this newborn while she was still human.

685
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:07,790
Bring the informer forward.

686
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:30,540
I'm not sure.

687
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:31,510
Jane.

688
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:35,060
She's changed. This child is bigger.

689
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:37,260
Then your allegations were false.

690
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,230
The Cullens are innocent.

691
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:42,600
I take full responsibility for my mistake.

692
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:47,640
I'm sorry.

693
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:12,040
Blind them.

694
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:19,890
Give me my sight back.

695
01:20:19,910 --> 01:20:21,460
Tanya, this is what they want.

696
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:23,250
If you attack now, we'll all die.

697
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,540
Pain.

698
01:21:23,290 --> 01:21:24,050
It's working.

699
01:21:57,550 --> 01:21:59,430
Aro, you see there's no law broken here.

700
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:01,540
Agreed.

701
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:05,550
But does it then follow

702
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,750
For the first time in our history

703
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:21,580
humans pose a threat to our kind.

704
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:26,780
Their modern technology has given birth to weapons

705
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,520
that could destroy us.

706
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:33,260
Maintaining our secret

707
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:36,070
has never been more imperative.

708
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:41,400
In such perilous times,

709
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:44,630
only the known

710
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:46,350
is safe.

711
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:49,880
Only the known

712
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:51,620
is tolerable.

713
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:53,950
And we know nothing

714
01:22:54,330 --> 01:22:58,100
of what this child will become.

715
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:08,470
Spare ourselves a fight today,

716
01:23:10,650 --> 01:23:11,960
only to die

717
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:14,230
tomorrow.

718
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:16,310
No.

719
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:29,840
Alice.

720
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,610
My dear, dear Alice,

721
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:52,690
we're so glad to see you here, after all.

722
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:55,860
I have evidence the child won't be a risk to our kind.

723
01:23:58,100 --> 01:23:58,870
Let me show you.

724
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:28,580
It doesn't matter what I show you.

725
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:32,040
Even when you see,

726
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:35,540
you still won't change your decision.

727
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:50,290
Take care of my daughter.

728
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:57,440
Get them.

729
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,240
Take her away.

730
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:13,200
Finally.

731
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:06,590
Now you know.

732
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:08,930
That's your future.

733
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:12,490
Unless you decide on another course.

734
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:16,420
We cannot alter our course. The child still poses a grave threat.

735
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:17,940
But what if you were sure

736
01:34:21,950 --> 01:34:24,150
Of course. But that cannot be known.

737
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:26,350
Actually, it can.

738
01:35:05,150 --> 01:35:07,480
I've been searching for witnesses of my own

739
01:35:07,850 --> 01:35:09,340
among the Ticuna tribes of Brazil.

740
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,340
- We have enough witnesses. - Let him speak, brother.

741
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:14,490
I am half human,

742
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:16,380
half vampire.

743
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:18,570
Like the child.

744
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:21,700
A vampire seduced my mother,

745
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:23,840
who died giving birth to me.

746
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:25,450
My aunt Huilen

747
01:35:27,010 --> 01:35:27,960
raised me as her own.

748
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:31,300
I made her immortal.

749
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:39,970
150 years.

750
01:35:44,570 --> 01:35:47,660
I became full-grown seven years after my birth.

751
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:50,500
I have not changed since then.

752
01:35:57,570 --> 01:35:58,030
Blood,

753
01:35:58,820 --> 01:35:59,820
human food.

754
01:36:01,050 --> 01:36:02,340
I can survive on either.

755
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:06,830
These children are much like us.

756
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:10,020
Regardless, the Cullens have been consorting with werewolves.

757
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:11,510
Our natural enemies.

758
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:25,710
Dear ones,

759
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:30,000
there is no danger here.

760
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:35,060
We will not fight today.

761
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:05,430
Such a prize.

762
01:37:09,210 --> 01:37:12,290
We have them on the run. Now is the time to attack.

763
01:37:12,770 --> 01:37:13,730
Not today.

764
01:37:19,060 --> 01:37:20,750
The Volturi might be gone,

765
01:37:21,370 --> 01:37:23,090
but they will never forgive

766
01:37:23,670 --> 01:37:24,810
what happened here.

767
01:38:23,370 --> 01:38:24,720
You have a beautiful family.

768
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:38,430
A very long time.

769
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:42,810
I'm glad she has you.

770
01:38:55,460 --> 01:38:55,930
No.

771
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:19,530
Yeah. We're all gonna be together now.

772
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:00,410
I wanna show you something.

773
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:36,250
I'm Edward Cullen.

774
01:41:37,470 --> 01:41:38,600
Been practicing.

775
01:41:41,690 --> 01:41:42,640
Now you know.

776
01:41:46,210 --> 01:41:49,180
Nobody's ever loved anybody as much as I love you.

777
01:41:50,990 --> 01:41:52,250
There's one exception.

778
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:07,970
We've got a lotta time.

779
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:11,480
Forever.

780
01:42:14,860 --> 01:42:15,660
Forever.

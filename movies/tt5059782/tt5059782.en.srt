1
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,434
My name is Cygnus.

2
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:18,036
I am my people's hunter.

3
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:21,506
And it has grown scarce for some time.

4
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,343
We are the children of man.

5
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:28,680
Out here, we are not the only ones.

6
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,951
Many bands now travel the land again.

7
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:35,654
We are called last arc.

8
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,857
The ones with stories on our skin.

9
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,793
I wondered what became of the world

10
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,396
before the one I was born into.

11
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:49,334
I only knew a world where
the few moved together.

12
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:53,038
I have farther to go to
find the beasts I hunt.

13
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,351
Hey!

14
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,787
Hey!

15
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,135
Let me go. Let me go! Please.

16
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,204
Why are you here?

17
00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:34,139
I know you.

18
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:37,108
Now you see it too, right?

19
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,578
The darker days.

20
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,580
Yes.

21
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,849
Me too, I see 'em too.

22
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,785
But she needs you.

23
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,653
Hunter of blood...

24
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,989
And hope.

25
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:54,493
Hope is not what I hunt for.

26
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,330
Does it look like I have any hope?

27
00:04:58,332 --> 00:04:59,698
Hey!

28
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,668
I'm just like you!
I see it too!

29
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,841
I know your story too.

30
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,210
You're the little boy.

31
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:17,516
The little boy that killed the snakes.

32
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,557
I'm done. The end!

33
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,730
No!

34
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,001
I live away from last arc

35
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,936
to hear what the wind is saying.

36
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,739
Even if it makes me their outsider.

37
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,875
It's telling me that this can't go on.

38
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:47,212
Sometimes I ask myself why I stay.

39
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,882
But then I remember they
found me and brought me in.

40
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,919
They gave me a place to call home.

41
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,955
For this I have my life.

42
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,766
The sun has crossed the river track

43
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,002
and brings the hunter back.

44
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,772
They know the way.

45
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,309
They found us, Cygnus

46
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,612
we're against the days.

47
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,619
It doesn't help it's
written all over them.

48
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:02,954
They're afraid.

49
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,326
It's the future that must be protected.

50
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,631
They don't go out there like you do.

51
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,800
They can't.

52
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,037
They're watching.

53
00:07:22,808 --> 00:07:24,809
Is everyone here?

54
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,088
They're near.

55
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,323
How many?

56
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:40,158
Three.

57
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,382
You're the hunter.

58
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,519
You're the one that killed the snakes.

59
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,090
What's it like?

60
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,926
Elias!

61
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,395
Elias.

62
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,232
Elias!

63
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,308
Listen to me, okay?

64
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,976
That hunter

65
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,479
has a mind where killing is a natural act.

66
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,748
That hunter is not the same as you.

67
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,451
It's not you or him, dad.

68
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,287
Mom wanted us to live.

69
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,244
I know you.

70
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:23,114
Who's there?

71
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,052
Nova, it's me.
I'm coming in.

72
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:31,623
You precede yourself.

73
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,762
It's not me you should be concerned about.

74
00:11:38,163 --> 00:11:40,164
You have a new orphan,

75
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,333
and he's lucky to be alive.

76
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:44,502
Elden was a good father

77
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,804
but he didn't know how to
handle himself out there.

78
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:53,444
Before we know the way out

79
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,749
we must know ourselves first.

80
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:02,120
The heretics should not be this close.

81
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,590
Is that not a sign?

82
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,260
Cygnus

83
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,430
I need to send you.

84
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:16,768
Send me where?

85
00:12:23,108 --> 00:12:25,944
Somewhere in the darkness.

86
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:29,280
Where there is light.

87
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,784
That has an answer.

88
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,688
What do you see?

89
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,457
I see us all trying to...

90
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:45,463
It's not easy.

91
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,299
Survival never is.

92
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,868
But it's not a choice that we get to make.

93
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:57,575
I believe in the stories.

94
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:59,744
I've heard the stories.

95
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,546
I'll believe it when I see scars.

96
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,049
Then look at this!

97
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,425
Who died

98
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:17,028
in search with no end?

99
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,464
Our ancestors!

100
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,065
Ours!

101
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,236
Don't you forget that.

102
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:29,941
The hunt is all that I've ever known.

103
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,844
I'm not asking you to kill.

104
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:36,180
I'm asking you to hunt.

105
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,517
To find the answers

106
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,686
that will stop this.

107
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,732
Shappa.

108
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,369
Don't say it.

109
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,204
I know.

110
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:02,707
What do you know?

111
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,209
Nova sent you.

112
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,379
Did she say why?

113
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,048
She knows why she wants me here.

114
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,783
Ha!

115
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,153
Nova knows what she wants,

116
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:16,754
and doesn't want.

117
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,891
I need an answer.

118
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,063
You need to be hunting
for food, not answers.

119
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:29,067
Nova wants me to find something.

120
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,103
I'm not a scholar.
Where do I begin?

121
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,207
With a question!

122
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,253
It's in here somewhere.

123
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:51,189
Oh!

124
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,824
Okay, look.

125
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,659
Over here.

126
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,994
Over here.

127
00:14:57,896 --> 00:14:59,931
This is also the answer!

128
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,766
Where would the answer be

129
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:04,268
if it had be somewhere?

130
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,605
Wherever it isn't.

131
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,145
There would be older breakage here.

132
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,282
And?

133
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,019
It's been hot here for a very long time.

134
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,491
That's a good place to look.

135
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,292
Why?

136
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,661
If you think of population

137
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,631
or what used to be present.

138
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,400
Then it's pretty simple to look at

139
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,069
what isn't

140
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,138
and what is.

141
00:15:42,407 --> 00:15:45,042
There could be more like us out there.

142
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,547
I need to take a look at your stories.

143
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:05,329
Yeah, yeah.

144
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,670
You were there!

145
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,707
I remember a burning sky.

146
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:21,212
And being taken up when a
shadow eclipsed the sun.

147
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,253
Tokens of our past

148
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,689
are our guide

149
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,891
when we have no map.

150
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:39,063
You could kill snakes with your two hands

151
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:42,700
before you could even walk.

152
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,204
You have strength.

153
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:48,739
Don't be afraid to use it.

154
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,046
We don't have a choice now.

155
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,815
This time

156
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,784
had to come.

157
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,550
Can you tell me

158
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,086
what it's like to be alone?

159
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,824
The world listens to you live.

160
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,327
Don't be afraid.

161
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,264
My dad had more to tell me.

162
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,966
I just hope we can find a way out of here.

163
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,036
That's what I am going for.

164
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,437
Here.

165
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,805
Take these.

166
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,441
They're from my dad.

167
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,443
Give it to the ones who are hiding,

168
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,612
waiting to kill.

169
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,654
I will stand for you to find your way.

170
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,956
I promise.

171
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,903
It will soon be ours.

172
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,008
He said

173
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,411
we can't kill this one.

174
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:02,780
He said he doesn't want him.

175
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:05,082
He needs him.

176
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,756
I see what you are,

177
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,758
hunter.

178
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:21,665
You should have killed
me. Why didn't you?

179
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:24,602
I don't regret letting you live.

180
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,872
You're already dead.

181
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,550
Yeah!

182
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:41,118
Yes!

183
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,219
Harder!

184
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:44,054
Make him bleed!

185
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:45,556
Yeah!

186
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:46,457
Oh!

187
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:48,092
Yes!

188
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:51,662
Zizzik!

189
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,797
You know you can't kill him.

190
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:59,069
This I need to know.

191
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:00,804
Not for him,

192
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,640
but for our power.

193
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,075
It's been years!

194
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,777
What is one more day?

195
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,747
We are tired of waiting, Lexi!

196
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:12,116
Lupis, stay out of this.

197
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,917
Something must break!

198
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,420
Either it's him, or it's us.

199
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:18,489
So stop fighting me.

200
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:21,592
If I don't fight today,
tomorrow there are no "if's".

201
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:23,827
Torik needs the answers!

202
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,831
No! No!

203
00:24:31,836 --> 00:24:33,837
Aha! Ha!!

204
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,758
Many will die

205
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,128
to keep a noose around
that killer's collar.

206
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:52,176
Don't worry.

207
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,978
We'll get there.

208
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,680
It is done.

209
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,849
Bring her up here.

210
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:44,094
We need the power, torik.

211
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,699
Betrayal opens the door.

212
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:51,134
Remember that.

213
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,502
Man did.

214
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,705
That's what moved them.

215
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:56,473
Her betrayal

216
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:59,710
will open the door to your heart's desire.

217
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:01,745
Isn't that interesting?

218
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,838
Come on!

219
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,576
No!

220
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,028
When I was

221
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,463
in the hills once

222
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:56,266
one of them horses

223
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:59,603
she couldn't move much, you see!

224
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,773
It wasn't her fault.

225
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:07,444
She tripped in a big, black hole.

226
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,780
But,

227
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,950
it wasn't the ones who moved her

228
00:29:13,217 --> 00:29:15,285
it was the ones who grew her,

229
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:17,054
raised her.

230
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,757
And after long

231
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,327
she got weak in the knee

232
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:27,464
do you know what they did?

233
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,435
Do you know

234
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,303
what they did!?

235
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:35,138
Ahh!

236
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,279
They watched that most

237
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,314
beautiful creature

238
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,316
die.

239
00:29:47,618 --> 00:29:50,153
And do you know why?

240
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:52,556
Because with

241
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,157
hunters like

242
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,659
that one

243
00:29:56,627 --> 00:29:59,663
they would be next.

244
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,867
Oh.

245
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,837
The deal has changed.

246
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,576
Ahhh!!

247
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,356
They will never understand you, Cygnus.

248
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:28,792
Not like I do.

249
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:31,128
That's the killer, Cygnus.

250
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,196
That one.

251
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:39,503
Take this blade

252
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:41,605
and end this.

253
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,943
And your precious last arc
will be free forever.

254
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:50,380
Refuse and...

255
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:56,953
All those beautiful souls you hunt for

256
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:00,390
will be...

257
00:31:01,225 --> 00:31:03,460
Well...

258
00:31:04,328 --> 00:31:06,930
So what will it be?

259
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,782
That's it.

260
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,762
There's the answer!

261
00:31:40,264 --> 00:31:41,698
You...

262
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,134
Made a wise choice today.

263
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,442
Today

264
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:54,711
you made history.

265
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:56,279
No!

266
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,586
She will die.

267
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,688
Then he will die.

268
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:07,958
Then all the people he calls

269
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,426
his people

270
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,795
will die.

271
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:13,296
Hm?

272
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:20,804
Chain them up!

273
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:42,826
I see what you fight for.

274
00:32:43,427 --> 00:32:45,829
Why didn't he kill you
when he saw I couldn't?

275
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:48,498
They were promised power
where we're going.

276
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,001
They want us alive.

277
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,184
Black sand.

278
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:11,521
Is this the place?

279
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,858
Just a little further.

280
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:17,460
Man left it there.

281
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:18,895
For us?

282
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:21,698
For all of us.

283
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,717
Do you know what is in there?

284
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:46,056
Everything their world had,
and their children do not.

285
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,412
This

286
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:13,250
is how it ends!

287
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,825
Will this do?

288
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:48,345
At least we still have time
before they try to get in.

289
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:53,350
Now I can ask

290
00:35:53,617 --> 00:35:55,552
what is your name?

291
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:59,656
Mari.

292
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,691
A wolf without a pack.

293
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:03,860
Packs hold me back.

294
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,962
But

295
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:08,698
I have heard of the last arc.

296
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,901
I know them well.

297
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:16,039
Are you with them?

298
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:23,780
Are you with them!?

299
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,720
They need me.

300
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:37,093
And I need them.

301
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:44,401
You mean that.

302
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,110
My name is Cygnus.

303
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:02,419
Like the constellation.

304
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,858
You are far from home.

305
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:14,230
Ahh! No!

306
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:09,552
I know what you're thinking.

307
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:13,656
You first.

308
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,838
This is the same as above.

309
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:32,041
It's how we got in.

310
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,444
We got in because you pulled us

311
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:36,646
to what could have been our deaths.

312
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:39,048
Did we have another choice?

313
00:38:43,153 --> 00:38:45,522
Let's keep moving.

314
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,869
Mari?

315
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,706
Mari?

316
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,239
That's terrible!

317
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:46,275
You have been haunting me
with that since last night.

318
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,077
It's based on a philosophy.

319
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,479
The walls of this place

320
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:51,314
will not protect all we knew.

321
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:53,483
Only the most important thing.

322
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:55,952
Why do you follow me with that thing?

323
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:58,888
I can't see both your eyes,
I want to see your eyes.

324
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,692
I want to see your eyes
like I saw them last night.

325
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:05,328
James.

326
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,264
Put it down.

327
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:11,300
Put it down quickly.

328
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,603
C'mon, put it down!

329
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:18,274
You're crazy and you're mad.

330
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:20,543
And god, I love you.

331
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,119
It's not something we can find.

332
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:31,654
Only something

333
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:34,323
we can know in ourselves.

334
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,359
Don't worry my child,

335
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:38,461
that's what I am here for.

336
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:40,630
I know she loves me.

337
00:41:40,632 --> 00:41:42,165
I know she's gone

338
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,866
but she won't be long.

339
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:45,868
She's my hero

340
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,403
is what I told my class.

341
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,841
She told me lots of people are
going to sleep these days

342
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,976
because of the ocean.

343
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:55,645
A crypt.

344
00:41:55,647 --> 00:41:57,747
Made when the season of man
came to an end.

345
00:41:59,883 --> 00:42:03,052
No one lives forever, my child.

346
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:06,522
That's why life is so marvelous.

347
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,826
And every day we live is a gift.

348
00:42:09,828 --> 00:42:11,661
I love it when she tells me stories

349
00:42:11,663 --> 00:42:14,664
about the whole big world that she sees.

350
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:17,233
That little light deep in your heart,

351
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:19,235
is your soul.

352
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:23,306
Use it to make the world a better place.

353
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,877
You're crazy and you're mad.

354
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:31,013
And god, I love you.
And god, I love you.

355
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,715
I love you so much.

356
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,817
All things must come to a close.

357
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:37,854
I just want her to come home.

358
00:42:37,856 --> 00:42:41,124
With love, the future is yours to make.

359
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:45,061
This is an ode to the era we knew.

360
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:48,965
To live to see the great day that dawns.

361
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:53,102
No! No! No! No!

362
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:56,439
No.

363
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:58,374
Don't make this hard for me.

364
00:42:58,376 --> 00:42:59,942
She can't go to sleep.

365
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:02,745
Let me see him. No!

366
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:06,082
James, you've got to listen
to me, James, listen.

367
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:08,251
I'm here now, alright?

368
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:09,719
I'm going to give you my blood

369
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:11,254
and you're going to be fine, okay?

370
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:12,789
Stop!

371
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:15,625
Because I'm not going to let you go.

372
00:43:16,426 --> 00:43:18,060
You hear me?

373
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:20,997
I will never let go.

374
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:24,734
I'm not going to let you go.

375
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:26,502
I love you

376
00:43:30,974 --> 00:43:33,810
It's just a long walk you're going on.

377
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:37,613
Anywhere in the world will be your home.

378
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,983
It's just a long walk you're going on.

379
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,487
This is the answer.

380
00:44:34,671 --> 00:44:36,572
Mari.

381
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:39,909
What's wrong with you?

382
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:44,080
They tried.

383
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:50,386
They knew their time was up.

384
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,924
Love.

385
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,729
That is to be human.

386
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:02,665
To give and be vulnerable.

387
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:04,333
This is no different.

388
00:45:04,335 --> 00:45:06,068
This is, Cygnus!

389
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:10,539
We have no future on this wasted planet!

390
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,408
No, you need to understand...

391
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,078
I saw the humans at the end of their days.

392
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,782
If they can feel something, why can't I?

393
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,590
It looks like you can.

394
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:09,031
I want to say something

395
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:12,802
but I don't know the words.

396
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:17,206
Show me.

397
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:46,902
Shh.

398
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,300
I thought you could see everything

399
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:20,236
without looking.

400
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,941
You still think I can see everything?

401
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:28,044
Come in.

402
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:52,101
Why are you here?

403
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,373
I have a question

404
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,442
about some kids.

405
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,211
What kids?

406
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:04,880
- Us.
- No.

407
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,215
Please, I...

408
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:08,017
I can't.

409
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:10,019
I insist.

410
00:48:10,021 --> 00:48:12,655
You've been spending way
too many days alone.

411
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:17,860
In fact, me being here pestering you

412
00:48:17,862 --> 00:48:19,695
is good for your health.

413
00:48:19,697 --> 00:48:22,965
You are not good for my health.

414
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:29,038
You know, a game

415
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,274
can remind us how to play in life.

416
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:37,613
- A game?
- Yeah.

417
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,182
Okay, I...

418
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,585
I call this one

419
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:44,253
want,

420
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:45,588
do,

421
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,790
remember.

422
00:48:47,792 --> 00:48:49,792
I'll start.

423
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:54,096
I remember...

424
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,266
It goes in that order.

425
00:49:00,303 --> 00:49:02,471
I remember...

426
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:07,309
The last time you were so focused.

427
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:10,412
You would sleep-walk
in the night

428
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:13,682
and always end up outside of my hut.

429
00:49:16,087 --> 00:49:19,388
I wasn't thinking clearly.

430
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:23,659
Of course you weren't.

431
00:49:23,661 --> 00:49:25,528
You were asleep.

432
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:28,364
Okay, my turn.

433
00:49:28,798 --> 00:49:30,966
I remember...

434
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,102
When you

435
00:49:33,104 --> 00:49:35,671
were so caught up in your mind

436
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:38,107
that you forgot to put the fire out

437
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:39,975
and you just about burnt your hut down

438
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,111
and we had to save you.

439
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:43,479
I was meditating.

440
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,181
You were naked!

441
00:49:45,183 --> 00:49:47,583
Doesn't change the fact.

442
00:49:50,453 --> 00:49:51,854
You're next.

443
00:49:51,856 --> 00:49:53,355
Now I'm done remembering.

444
00:49:58,361 --> 00:50:00,496
The next is, uh,

445
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,898
want.

446
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:05,768
I...

447
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:11,574
I always wanted to

448
00:50:14,844 --> 00:50:17,146
create a tablet that

449
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:19,615
tells the seasons.

450
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:21,917
Hm.

451
00:50:24,487 --> 00:50:27,456
I've always wanted

452
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:30,726
to spend more time in the water.

453
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:32,928
Swimming deeply

454
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:36,365
where the world accepts me for

455
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,400
all I am.

456
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:49,778
I accept you.

457
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,249
Since we were little.

458
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:57,486
They used to bother you.

459
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:01,991
You saw what others didn't.

460
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:08,264
I saw once that

461
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:12,301
those two could have made quite a pair.

462
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:18,941
So did he.

463
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:33,622
One more thing.

464
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:38,761
I didn't see this coming.

465
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:41,463
And I can't see any further.

466
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:43,799
But I remember

467
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:45,501
telling Cygnus under a spell

468
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:48,504
that somewhere dark,

469
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:54,143
where there is light that has an answer

470
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:59,481
I think it had something
to do with all of us.

471
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:31,780
You know Cygnus

472
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:34,850
lived a lonely life in the shadow too.

473
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:39,421
I know you miss them, Elias.

474
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,093
Whatever is happening now

475
00:52:44,627 --> 00:52:46,895
is more than any of us expected.

476
00:52:47,997 --> 00:52:49,531
Listen.

477
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:51,934
We don't have a choice now.

478
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:56,538
There was a time when we
weren't surrounded by death.

479
00:52:57,006 --> 00:52:59,808
If Cygnus finds a way

480
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:02,578
then we are along the trail.

481
00:53:28,671 --> 00:53:30,906
I see us.

482
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:33,442
This is who we are.

483
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:36,412
The people of land and water.

484
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:38,781
And that's it.

485
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,956
There's nothing more.

486
00:53:49,058 --> 00:53:52,428
All we can do is move across this place

487
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:55,597
all we can do is move

488
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,934
and survive.

489
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:07,976
Is that what you were looking for?

490
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,646
Yes.

491
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,775
Mari.

492
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:22,911
You have to be careful
and protect yourself.

493
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:24,913
They won't stop until someone's dead

494
00:56:24,915 --> 00:56:26,915
and I do not want it to be you.

495
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:29,384
Cygnus.

496
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,886
I'll teach you how to
get your bearings here

497
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:32,521
so at least you can get back.

498
00:56:32,523 --> 00:56:33,889
So if I'm captured...

499
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,223
Cygnus, stop.

500
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,192
We don't know what's going to happen

501
00:56:37,194 --> 00:56:39,061
but as long as one of us
can make it back alive...

502
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:40,829
Cygnus!

503
00:56:42,231 --> 00:56:44,466
I was set up to kill you.

504
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:55,310
I had no choice.

505
00:57:02,785 --> 00:57:04,953
I protected your life.

506
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:07,623
I know that.

507
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:11,460
You are not who I thought you were.

508
00:57:11,462 --> 00:57:13,161
How would you know?

509
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:15,564
Because you brought me back.

510
00:57:15,566 --> 00:57:17,399
From what?

511
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:19,001
From dying.

512
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:23,405
They took me in because I knew how to kill

513
00:57:23,407 --> 00:57:25,474
and then they made a deal with me.

514
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,614
It wasn't my intent to join

515
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:34,983
or belong or anything!

516
00:57:36,919 --> 00:57:40,155
I went with them to learn their secrets.

517
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:44,993
Where they hunt, where they
hide, and then I would vanish.

518
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:48,530
They set me up!

519
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,303
I hunt too.

520
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,938
I'm just like you!

521
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,407
Yes!

522
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:00,108
Yes!

523
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:02,310
I am a killer!

524
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,779
I kill!

525
00:58:03,781 --> 00:58:05,614
I hunt! I skin!

526
00:58:05,616 --> 00:58:09,518
But when my life was on the
line, I didn't think of myself.

527
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:14,189
Everything I said to you
was the truth, Mari.

528
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:17,192
Cygnus, I see you!

529
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:21,563
You are not who I thought you were.

530
00:58:50,893 --> 00:58:53,628
Just the old scars, please.

531
00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:57,599
Okay.

532
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:00,569
Hmm.

533
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,838
I believe

534
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,873
if I don't know the answer

535
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:07,242
then my hands do.

536
00:59:11,547 --> 00:59:14,416
Good luck with your archiving, shappa.

537
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:15,911
This...

538
01:00:15,913 --> 01:00:17,913
This is where...

539
01:00:17,915 --> 01:00:20,682
This is where they should
have been at the bluff.

540
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:25,487
This is the river here...

541
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:30,125
Ugh!

542
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:34,830
Where are you, Cygnus?

543
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,572
They are right.

544
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:53,575
I am their hunter.

545
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:58,246
And I have a promise to keep.

546
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:12,160
Where does Cygnus fit?

547
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:14,696
The river

548
01:02:14,698 --> 01:02:16,598
is over here.

549
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:21,403
Unh!

550
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:23,438
Where did I go wrong?

551
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:46,461
Right there.

552
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:49,464
Right there.

553
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:24,833
The snakes.

554
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:29,371
Cygnus.

555
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,342
The end.

556
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:39,681
It comes with him.

557
01:04:38,874 --> 01:04:41,309
- Shappa!
- Cygnus!

558
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:45,380
What did you find?

559
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,849
I found what they left behind.

560
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:50,585
You should think me a scholar after all.

561
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,721
You're a hunter and a damned good one.

562
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,757
I'm just glad you're back.

563
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,860
We'll see for how long.

564
01:04:58,862 --> 01:05:00,595
Come on!

565
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:09,564
Are you still the hunter?

566
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:12,667
Whatever I am,

567
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:15,370
after what I saw,

568
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:19,007
I see time differently now.

569
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,943
When you was gone,

570
01:06:21,945 --> 01:06:24,112
I thought you had come back in my dream.

571
01:06:24,114 --> 01:06:26,514
You was not killing no more.

572
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:36,524
You must have been dreaming.

573
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:39,961
You have to be ready

574
01:06:39,963 --> 01:06:42,030
for what's about to happen.

575
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:44,766
You're going to go for a long walk.

576
01:06:45,467 --> 01:06:47,202
Okay?

577
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:51,139
Cygnus, I want to know

578
01:06:51,141 --> 01:06:53,441
where we go.

579
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:56,911
I know.

580
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:26,140
Is there a reason we haven't
scalped this village?

581
01:07:28,844 --> 01:07:30,245
Are you

582
01:07:30,247 --> 01:07:33,314
questioning my authority again?

583
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:42,757
We don't know how many are able to fight.

584
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:45,393
This isn't about them.

585
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:47,428
It's about him, right?

586
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:49,197
That's what you said.

587
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:52,767
It has always been about them.

588
01:07:52,769 --> 01:07:55,770
It's always been about your sweet,

589
01:07:55,772 --> 01:07:58,106
golden future.

590
01:07:58,108 --> 01:07:59,874
But

591
01:07:59,876 --> 01:08:01,576
you,

592
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:03,678
you just want more.

593
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,214
What we want

594
01:08:06,216 --> 01:08:08,950
is for this to end!

595
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:12,220
You want.

596
01:08:12,222 --> 01:08:16,591
You want! And want!
And want! And want!

597
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:18,393
And want!!

598
01:08:18,395 --> 01:08:19,894
What you want

599
01:08:19,896 --> 01:08:21,396
is me!

600
01:08:21,398 --> 01:08:23,665
You need me!

601
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:29,137
You want the power, zizzik?

602
01:08:29,139 --> 01:08:31,272
Then take this

603
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:33,508
and go carve it out of them.

604
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:52,660
Almost there.

605
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:55,330
Almost there.

606
01:08:56,131 --> 01:08:58,433
So this crypt was built by humans?

607
01:08:58,435 --> 01:09:00,902
Yes. And left for us.

608
01:09:04,506 --> 01:09:06,507
Here.

609
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:08,676
It helped them get through

610
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:15,083
Nova.

611
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:18,086
It's me that they're after.

612
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:21,889
How do you know this?

613
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:26,894
They would have killed me
when they had the chance.

614
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:54,122
Cygnus.

615
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:29,590
And I thought you were a lone wolf.

616
01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:41,969
If you feel nothing, then you survive.

617
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:46,641
But if you feel something...

618
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:51,179
Then you have something to live for.

619
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:57,979
This

620
01:11:57,981 --> 01:12:00,414
is what you heart tells you?

621
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:04,952
Tell me how you met.

622
01:12:04,954 --> 01:12:07,788
By the edge of the blade.

623
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:10,091
How everyone else does.

624
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:12,760
Hm.

625
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:14,962
But...

626
01:12:14,964 --> 01:12:17,098
But I saw you.

627
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:21,936
I saw you too.

628
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,229
This

629
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:50,565
is the memories

630
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:53,067
that live

631
01:12:53,069 --> 01:12:55,436
where the blood bonds.

632
01:12:56,838 --> 01:12:59,574
Your story will be great.

633
01:13:01,209 --> 01:13:03,411
Do not be afraid.

634
01:13:03,413 --> 01:13:05,279
I never was.

635
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:11,752
My heart recognizes her.

636
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:14,188
She is welcome.

637
01:13:46,421 --> 01:13:48,623
Ah! Ah!

638
01:13:55,564 --> 01:13:58,199
They're coming!

639
01:13:58,967 --> 01:14:01,469
They are coming!

640
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:05,640
Warn them, warn them!

641
01:14:05,642 --> 01:14:07,508
They're sending the dead!

642
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:11,178
Where's the children?

643
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:27,161
Where're the baby?

644
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:29,463
If I don't come back,

645
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:31,265
lead them some place safe.

646
01:14:31,267 --> 01:14:33,801
If you don't come back,
I'm coming after you.

647
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:36,170
No. They need you here.

648
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:39,573
Cygnus!

649
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:42,143
No matter how we leave,

650
01:14:42,145 --> 01:14:44,712
our echoes won't.

651
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:56,023
Nova!

652
01:15:25,654 --> 01:15:27,221
Ahhh!

653
01:17:11,593 --> 01:17:17,698
Look what beautiful things you have done.

654
01:17:19,601 --> 01:17:21,569
That's right, Cygnus.

655
01:17:22,103 --> 01:17:25,005
Anything you've always done

656
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:28,075
has always been right.

657
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:50,364
Cygnus!

658
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:01,308
No. No.

659
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:02,710
No!

660
01:18:02,712 --> 01:18:04,912
If you touch her, I will kill you.

661
01:18:05,146 --> 01:18:07,748
I will kill you! No!

662
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:10,551
No! Run!

663
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:13,354
Run!

664
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:15,723
Run back! No!

665
01:18:15,725 --> 01:18:17,157
No!

666
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:19,159
Cygnus!

667
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:20,561
Ohh!

668
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:32,740
He can't.

669
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:35,776
He needs to know what he is!

670
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:39,246
Look at me. Come on,
stay with me.

671
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:40,848
Stay with me.

672
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:43,183
They say too much, Mari.

673
01:18:43,185 --> 01:18:46,086
I have to speak now!

674
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:49,089
I'm here. I'm here, Nova.
Nova, I'm here. Look at me.

675
01:18:49,091 --> 01:18:51,425
Okay? Look at me.

676
01:18:51,427 --> 01:18:53,294
I need to speak now.

677
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:03,604
Nova, what's happening to me!?

678
01:19:06,274 --> 01:19:09,109
You belong to us too.

679
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:13,314
We live through one another.

680
01:19:14,749 --> 01:19:16,317
Look!

681
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:30,164
My light is passing.

682
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:34,034
You have the ancestors in your eyes.

683
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:37,371
You lead them.

684
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:43,377
Tell Cygnus...

685
01:19:44,312 --> 01:19:48,182
Tell him he always belonged here.

686
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:52,586
He was never

687
01:19:52,588 --> 01:19:54,655
one of them

688
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:41,602
you hear that?

689
01:20:42,637 --> 01:20:44,204
That voice

690
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:47,374
that screams "let go".

691
01:20:50,845 --> 01:20:53,047
You can't silence it.

692
01:20:53,314 --> 01:20:55,616
It's a part of you.

693
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:59,119
The horse never wanted you.

694
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:02,890
You had hope in your eye.

695
01:21:04,993 --> 01:21:06,994
But every last one

696
01:21:06,996 --> 01:21:10,631
of those pathetic souls

697
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:13,567
will suffer the same fate

698
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:17,237
as your snakes.

699
01:21:19,841 --> 01:21:22,076
You see...

700
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:24,011
Our stories

701
01:21:24,013 --> 01:21:25,979
are the same.

702
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:32,286
Do you see why she never wanted you?

703
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:36,590
Who?

704
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:40,260
Our mother.

705
01:21:45,366 --> 01:21:46,900
No.

706
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:49,770
No.

707
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:52,606
No!

708
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:55,576
No!!!

709
01:21:55,578 --> 01:21:57,945
Yes, brother!

710
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:04,718
My entire life...

711
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,253
Everything!

712
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:08,255
All of this

713
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:10,190
has been you.

714
01:22:15,063 --> 01:22:17,531
You were never one of them.

715
01:22:23,805 --> 01:22:25,906
Aahh!!

716
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:46,693
Just like me!

717
01:22:50,832 --> 01:22:53,167
You're just like me.

718
01:23:02,343 --> 01:23:04,711
What are you waiting for!?

719
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:08,682
Get him off me.

720
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:13,687
I said get him off me!

721
01:23:13,689 --> 01:23:15,355
Where is the power you promised us

722
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:18,025
to put the noose around
the killer's collar!?

723
01:23:18,027 --> 01:23:19,493
You took all you can!

724
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:23,197
You can't take us!

725
01:23:25,466 --> 01:23:27,401
Where are you going!?

726
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:31,038
Where are you going!?

727
01:23:31,806 --> 01:23:34,441
You can't walk away!

728
01:23:41,983 --> 01:23:45,452
Where do you think you're going?

729
01:23:46,821 --> 01:23:49,122
Cygnus!

730
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:54,528
Wait!

731
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:57,931
Wait! Wait! Wait-wait-wait!

732
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:00,901
Who do you think

733
01:24:00,903 --> 01:24:02,603
kept you alive all this time?

734
01:24:04,672 --> 01:24:07,307
Who looked out for you?

735
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:17,851
I just wanted you

736
01:24:17,853 --> 01:24:20,787
to be like me.

737
01:24:23,057 --> 01:24:25,559
This isn't for me.

738
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:28,161
It's for them.

739
01:26:07,528 --> 01:26:11,965
Courage is the only thing
you need where you're going.

740
01:26:11,967 --> 01:26:14,201
Think I'll make it?

741
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:16,570
You've made it this far.

742
01:26:17,205 --> 01:26:19,239
You'll see once you get there.

743
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:22,709
You're part of it too, you know?

744
01:26:23,544 --> 01:26:25,612
See.

745
01:26:26,814 --> 01:26:28,382
It's a gift.

746
01:26:43,898 --> 01:26:46,333
You brave little warrior.

747
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:57,377
Nova.

748
01:26:57,379 --> 01:27:00,914
The answer is that we are not out of time.

749
01:27:00,916 --> 01:27:03,450
To feel is to live.

750
01:27:03,751 --> 01:27:05,752
To feel is to continue.

751
01:27:07,054 --> 01:27:10,457
The last arc will find its way.

752
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:13,493
And maybe one day I will find mine.

753
01:27:24,705 --> 01:27:27,507
What is the wind telling you, Cygnus?

754
01:27:31,946 --> 01:27:34,181
It's harder to hear now.

755
01:27:36,884 --> 01:27:38,351
Then

756
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:41,521
something is about to change.

757
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:46,960
Will you come with us?

758
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:55,135
I've seen enough.

759
01:28:23,764 --> 01:28:25,866
It's time we left.

760
01:28:28,135 --> 01:28:30,170
Then where do we go?

761
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,741
We go north.

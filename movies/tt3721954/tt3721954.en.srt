1
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,760
She's been asking to go home.

2
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,397
Well-- Well, did you tell her?

3
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,265
Not yet. I thought
it best you do it.

4
00:02:46,298 --> 00:02:50,569
No, she has to understand,
this is her home now.

5
00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:54,407
I can't keep her here.

6
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,942
But we agreed, Aunt Ida.

7
00:02:55,974 --> 00:02:58,677
You said
you'd look after her.

8
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:01,713
I am paying you
to look after her.

9
00:03:11,423 --> 00:03:14,426
Hello there, Charles.

10
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,263
Sister.

11
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:18,730
Good to see you.

12
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,903
That's a nice suit
you're wearing.

13
00:03:24,937 --> 00:03:28,574
Oh, yeah.

14
00:03:24,937 --> 00:03:28,574
Perfect fit.

15
00:03:28,606 --> 00:03:31,711
You're always
such a spiffy dresser.

16
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,350
So you...

17
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:40,786
come to take me home?

18
00:03:40,818 --> 00:03:42,854
No. No.

19
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:46,391
Well, it's business, Maud,
financial matters.

20
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:50,263
Oh, good.
Well, I'm a natural at math.

21
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:51,830
Remember?

22
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,332
Heh. Always used
to check your numbers

23
00:03:54,366 --> 00:03:56,335
when you were in school.

24
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:58,370
Didn't I, Aunt Ida?

25
00:03:58,403 --> 00:04:02,375
I wanted to drop off
a few things for you.

26
00:04:03,808 --> 00:04:05,611
Lordy.

27
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:10,483
You cleared out my room.

28
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,784
Why?

29
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:14,721
I sold the house.

30
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:18,590
What?

31
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:20,826
Our house?

32
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:20,826
Maud...

33
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:23,762
Mom left it to me.

34
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:23,762
No.

35
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:25,964
You can't-- You--

36
00:04:25,997 --> 00:04:28,334
You can't sell our house.

37
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:32,071
Charles, you can't sell
our house.

38
00:04:32,103 --> 00:04:34,306
I'd-- I'd--
I'd look after it.

39
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:37,310
I'd be more than happy
to have my own place, Charles.

40
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:38,610
You can't
look after yourself,

41
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:40,780
let alone a house
and a yard and--

42
00:04:40,812 --> 00:04:43,649
I'd get a job.
I'd get a job or something.

43
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:47,019
A job? A job doing what?

44
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:47,019
I don't know, Charles!

45
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:48,421
I'm sorry, Maud.
It's done.

46
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,057
No. Wait. Charles.

47
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:53,425
Charles.

48
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,093
Charles, wait.

49
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:56,795
Don't. Don't.

50
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,831
Goodbye, sister.

51
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:01,900
You can't--

52
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:01,900
You take care of yourself.

53
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,903
No, wait. Charles.

54
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:05,770
Maud.

55
00:05:05,803 --> 00:05:08,340
Come get your tea.

56
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,810
Charles! Charles!

57
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,446
Wait!

58
00:05:17,716 --> 00:05:21,687
Gonna do
some painting out here.

59
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,955
Too messy.

60
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:25,490
Why don't you put your things
away in your room?

61
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:28,327
Why don't you
leave me alone?

62
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:30,115
You better not tell me
you were out at that club.

63
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:33,519
Wasn't gonna
tell you that.

64
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:35,187
Where were you?

65
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,957
At the club. Heh.

66
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,793
Wasn't gonna
tell you that.

67
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:45,898
Only looking
to meet friends.

68
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,565
That's what you said
the last time.

69
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:49,468
Look what happened.

70
00:07:51,802 --> 00:07:54,606
You should try it
sometime.

71
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,009
You might like it.

72
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,074
This is new.

73
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,287
Well, well, well,
look who's gracing me

74
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,023
with their presence today.

75
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:47,091
What can I do for you, Everett?

76
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:47,091
I'm looking for a woman.

77
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,293
A what?

78
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:51,029
Uh, a...
hou-- Housemaid.

79
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:54,766
Looking for a housemaid.

80
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:54,766
Not the kind of thing we sell.

81
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:57,802
Am I--?
Am I an idiot, huh?

82
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:00,906
No, I wanna put up
a sign, you know, a--

83
00:09:00,938 --> 00:09:04,576
What do you--?
What do you call them?

84
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,913
Well, I need you
to write--

85
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:09,648
To write a sign.

86
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:09,648
Yeah.

87
00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:13,284
Okay.

88
00:09:13,317 --> 00:09:16,822
Looking
for a housemaid.

89
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:19,991
Must have her own--

90
00:09:20,024 --> 00:09:22,927
Oh, shit! Her own--
What's the word I'm looking for?

91
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:25,331
Sense of humor?

92
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:25,331
No.

93
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,600
No.

94
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,067
Cleaning tools.

95
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,135
Must have her own
cleaning tools. That's it.

96
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:32,704
That'd do it.

97
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,206
Yeah. And then you--

98
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:37,276
Contact Everett Lewis.

99
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:37,276
Yeah, sign my name. Right.

100
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:39,211
Here.
Give it to me.

101
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:40,913
That's it.

102
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,716
Need a hand,
that's all.

103
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:49,881
Hello, big boy.

104
00:10:49,914 --> 00:10:52,918
Beautiful. You are.

105
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:12,838
Hey. Hey.

106
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,139
You a guard? You a guard dog?

107
00:11:15,173 --> 00:11:16,442
Hey, hello.

108
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:17,942
Hello.

109
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:29,287
Hello.

110
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,793
Um, I'm Maud.

111
00:11:36,227 --> 00:11:37,462
Dowley.

112
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:41,265
Dowley.

113
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:41,265
Yeah. That's right.

114
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:43,067
I was--

115
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,937
Got your ad at the store.

116
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,306
The one you posted,

117
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,074
looking for a housemaid.

118
00:11:49,106 --> 00:11:52,845
Yeah. Well, I'm answering it.

119
00:11:54,245 --> 00:11:56,814
Looking for a woman.

120
00:11:56,847 --> 00:11:58,916
Well...

121
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,285
what do you think I am?

122
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:11,297
So...

123
00:12:12,496 --> 00:12:14,232
Well...

124
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:18,504
Well, I--

125
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,907
I walked here from Digby.

126
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,844
Wouldn't mind a cup of tea.

127
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:29,147
You can tell me
what you're looking for.

128
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:33,818
Thank you.

129
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,796
So...

130
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:48,432
This all yours?

131
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:51,070
Th-- This house?

132
00:12:54,471 --> 00:12:55,941
Nice.

133
00:12:55,974 --> 00:13:00,212
Used to be
Captain John Ryan's.

134
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:03,849
But I moved it here
from the wharf.

135
00:13:09,988 --> 00:13:14,393
Guess how many oxen
it took to move it.

136
00:13:16,193 --> 00:13:17,328
Two?

137
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:21,332
Not two. No. Seven.

138
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:25,169
Heh. Seven oxen.

139
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:25,169
That's a lot of oxen.

140
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:33,077
It'd be nice...

141
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,949
for you to have someone
around here.

142
00:13:40,018 --> 00:13:44,623
Yeah, must be hard
to do it all on your own.

143
00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:48,326
You got that right, ma'am.
Got that right, you know.

144
00:13:52,062 --> 00:13:53,465
What is it you do?

145
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:55,100
Sell fish.

146
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:59,471
Sell chopped wood. You know.

147
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:02,274
Work at the orphanage.

148
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:04,043
Lordy.

149
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:07,178
How do you keep it straight?

150
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:09,615
Got a lot on my plate.

151
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:12,084
Got a lot on my plate.

152
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:12,084
Yeah.

153
00:14:13,418 --> 00:14:15,387
I'd like the job.

154
00:14:17,655 --> 00:14:19,590
You walk funny.

155
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:21,894
You a cripple?

156
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:25,096
No.

157
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:25,096
No? You're not sick or nothing?

158
00:14:27,231 --> 00:14:30,870
No, I just--
I just walk funny.

159
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:38,310
It don't stop me.
I can do the work of five women.

160
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,149
You got an ashtray?

161
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,419
Flick 'em on the floor.

162
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,925
Thanks.

163
00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:56,294
Ouch.

164
00:15:00,097 --> 00:15:03,234
Many women apply for the job?

165
00:15:03,268 --> 00:15:05,437
You finished with your tea?

166
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,573
Well...

167
00:15:09,606 --> 00:15:12,410
might as well say it.

168
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:18,918
I'll put it...

169
00:15:23,254 --> 00:15:25,123
Well--

170
00:15:25,155 --> 00:15:27,992
You do need the help.
I can see that.

171
00:15:31,596 --> 00:15:35,133
A long walk home.

172
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:38,103
I bet they'll throw rocks
at me again.

173
00:15:38,135 --> 00:15:41,439
Who throws rocks?

174
00:15:41,472 --> 00:15:45,009
The kids. They don't mean it.
They don't mean it.

175
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:46,445
I don't care.

176
00:15:46,477 --> 00:15:50,348
Some people don't like it
if you're different.

177
00:15:58,756 --> 00:16:03,227
It's a lot of work to break
in a new shoe.

178
00:16:05,096 --> 00:16:07,566
Heels are galled
right off.

179
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:15,574
This is far as--
Far as we go.

180
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:19,010
Far as we go.

181
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:19,010
Oh, okay.

182
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:21,346
Uh-- Wai-- Eh--

183
00:16:51,408 --> 00:16:53,111
Come on.

184
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:03,254
Everything okay,
Everett?

185
00:17:09,626 --> 00:17:15,267
Thinking about hiring a woman
help around the house,

186
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:18,103
but slim pickings
applied for the job.

187
00:17:18,135 --> 00:17:19,403
Someone actually applied?

188
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:21,205
Might be better
with one of these boys.

189
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:23,240
These kids are
too young, Everett.

190
00:17:23,273 --> 00:17:25,276
Oh, when I was their age,
did the work of 10 men.

191
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:28,413
Cleaned this yard,
chopped wood, built that fence.

192
00:17:28,445 --> 00:17:31,148
Yes, but you were here,
around people.

193
00:17:31,182 --> 00:17:34,219
Everett?

194
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:36,654
If someone applied
for that job, hire them.

195
00:18:07,184 --> 00:18:09,087
Hi.

196
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,526
Nice day out.

197
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,463
I suppose
I'll give you a try.

198
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:21,733
That'd be nice.

199
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:24,769
Be nice.

200
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:26,337
Maud!

201
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,473
You gonna stand there all day?

202
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,473
No, no.

203
00:18:28,506 --> 00:18:31,276
What do you think you're doing?

204
00:18:28,506 --> 00:18:31,276
Yeah.

205
00:18:32,743 --> 00:18:35,212
Coming. Coming.

206
00:18:35,246 --> 00:18:36,882
You're neglecting your chores.

207
00:18:36,914 --> 00:18:39,218
Yeah, I know.

208
00:18:46,657 --> 00:18:48,192
God in heaven.

209
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:49,661
Yeah.

210
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,395
I'm a grown woman now.

211
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:54,399
I'll go off and find
my own place.

212
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:56,701
You can't look
after yourself, Maud.

213
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:58,836
I know you think that.

214
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:02,373
You are determined to put
a stain on this family name.

215
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:07,578
If you leave now,
you are never coming back.

216
00:19:07,612 --> 00:19:11,249
Do you know that?

217
00:19:07,612 --> 00:19:11,249
Yeah, I know. I know that.

218
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:13,851
Sorry. Got a job now.

219
00:19:13,884 --> 00:19:16,954
You been good to take me in,
but I gotta go now.

220
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:19,324
He's waiting for me.

221
00:19:19,356 --> 00:19:20,892
Bye, Aunt Ida.

222
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:23,728
Go.

223
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:18,516
I'm assuming--

224
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:20,451
Assuming I'm working
for room and board,

225
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:22,519
but...I was thinking

226
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:26,591
an extra 25 cents
spending money as well

227
00:20:26,624 --> 00:20:28,393
a week?

228
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:45,576
There you are. Heh.

229
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:53,785
Thought you left me
for a minute.

230
00:21:04,394 --> 00:21:07,865
What do you want me
to do first?

231
00:21:10,835 --> 00:21:14,372
If I stand over you all day,
I may as well do it myself.

232
00:21:14,404 --> 00:21:16,474
No--

233
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,895
You going through
my stuff?

234
00:22:47,164 --> 00:22:50,999
No. No, just...

235
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:51,703
pretty.

236
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:55,606
Well, you think that's why

237
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,575
I brought you
out here, so you could

238
00:22:57,607 --> 00:23:00,043
go through my gear, huh?

239
00:23:00,076 --> 00:23:01,813
No.

240
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,153
I made you soup.

241
00:23:08,185 --> 00:23:10,120
What is that? Huh?

242
00:23:10,153 --> 00:23:11,556
Turnip.

243
00:23:11,588 --> 00:23:13,758
I don--
I don't eat turnip.

244
00:23:14,925 --> 00:23:18,762
You haven't even cleared
the table.

245
00:23:18,796 --> 00:23:21,799
I was just-- I was just--

246
00:23:18,796 --> 00:23:21,799
You want me to pay you money

247
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,436
but you don't know a click
about cleaning.

248
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,171
No, no, no.

249
00:23:26,203 --> 00:23:29,507
No, no, not gonna work.
No, no lazy arses around here.

250
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:31,009
No lazy arses around here!

251
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:34,111
You get your stuff and get out!

252
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:34,111
No, no. No, no. No!

253
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,114
No! No!

254
00:23:36,146 --> 00:23:39,516
Why you do that?

255
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:41,051
Where do you want me
to go, huh?

256
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:43,788
Should've thought of that
when you were sitting here

257
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,557
going through my stuff.

258
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,557
I didn't know what you wanted.

259
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,192
I don't want to have
to look after you.

260
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:51,563
I want somebody who's
gonna do the looking after!

261
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,530
Not some
crippled-up woman.

262
00:23:53,564 --> 00:23:56,100
Now get out! It's my house!

263
00:23:53,564 --> 00:23:56,100
I'm getting out!

264
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:58,002
My house!

265
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:25,624
Yeah.

266
00:25:26,656 --> 00:25:28,292
Hello.

267
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,528
Hello.

268
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:35,100
Yeah, it's time.

269
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:38,036
You know.

270
00:25:38,068 --> 00:25:40,672
You know.
You know, don't you?

271
00:25:40,704 --> 00:25:42,606
You know.

272
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:48,112
Hey, gently.

273
00:25:48,144 --> 00:25:51,081
Hey, hey. I'm sorry.

274
00:25:53,784 --> 00:25:59,591
It's all right.
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

275
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:00,924
I know. I know. I know.

276
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:05,663
Oh, come here.
Oh, dear, it's okay.

277
00:26:05,695 --> 00:26:07,664
It's-- It's all right.

278
00:26:07,698 --> 00:26:09,000
Oh, dear.

279
00:26:09,032 --> 00:26:11,101
It's all right.
It's all right.

280
00:26:11,134 --> 00:26:14,071
Yeah, I know. I got you.

281
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:17,042
I'm sorry.

282
00:26:19,376 --> 00:26:20,744
Here we go.

283
00:26:20,778 --> 00:26:22,713
Shh. Shh. Shh.

284
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:26,718
I know. Sorry.

285
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,988
It's okay. It's okay.

286
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,857
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

287
00:28:05,915 --> 00:28:08,219
That's my chair.

288
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:10,154
That's my chair.

289
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,236
Want a bowl of stew?

290
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:29,874
Where'd you get the chicken?

291
00:28:29,906 --> 00:28:32,476
Killed it.

292
00:28:29,906 --> 00:28:32,476
You killed it?

293
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:34,712
The big one.

294
00:29:25,128 --> 00:29:26,830
So...

295
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:32,836
I'm gonna stay,
where do I sleep?

296
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:35,872
Are you gonna follow
my rules?

297
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:39,876
You cleaned?
Clean upstairs?

298
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,880
No.

299
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,880
No?

300
00:29:42,913 --> 00:29:44,515
There's only one bed
up there.

301
00:29:44,548 --> 00:29:47,018
Oh, you're a princess,
eh?

302
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:52,056
When I was at the orphanage,

303
00:29:52,088 --> 00:29:54,291
they put us six,
seven to a bunk, hm.

304
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:57,161
Elbows in my back.

305
00:29:57,193 --> 00:29:58,829
Feet up my arse.

306
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:01,365
If you're too fancy
to pile in,

307
00:30:01,397 --> 00:30:03,266
then you can take
your little knickknacks,

308
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:06,169
put them in the red wagon
and get out.

309
00:30:06,202 --> 00:30:10,441
No, I'm--
I'm good up there.

310
00:30:10,473 --> 00:30:12,409
I'm not too fancy.

311
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,220
Bad dogs!

312
00:30:56,252 --> 00:30:59,589
Down. Get down.
Down. Yeah, good boy.

313
00:30:59,623 --> 00:31:02,894
Who told you you could talk
to them dogs like that?

314
00:31:02,926 --> 00:31:04,528
What--?

315
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,596
They gotta learn.

316
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:10,234
Them dogs been here longer
than you. More useful too.

317
00:31:10,267 --> 00:31:14,272
I'm only-- I'm only trying
to feed 'em.

318
00:31:16,673 --> 00:31:20,944
Let me tell you how
it is around here, all right?

319
00:31:20,978 --> 00:31:23,648
There's me, them dogs,

320
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:26,451
them chickens, then you.

321
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,423
Everyone's talking.

322
00:32:05,455 --> 00:32:08,058
He has you barred up in there
as his love slave.

323
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,661
It's disgusting.

324
00:32:10,693 --> 00:32:12,529
Everett
with a love slave.

325
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:21,072
Would it make it more proper
if I married him?

326
00:32:22,172 --> 00:32:24,942
Maybe people won't talk
so much.

327
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,246
Aunt Ida?

328
00:32:30,713 --> 00:32:33,083
You wanna come visit me
sometime?

329
00:32:33,116 --> 00:32:34,719
I wouldn't be caught dead.

330
00:32:34,751 --> 00:32:37,955
I wouldn't even drive by
that house.

331
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,263
Suits me.

332
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:54,505
Love slave.

333
00:33:10,554 --> 00:33:12,757
What are you gonna do
with all this, Ev?

334
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:14,625
Sell it.

335
00:33:14,657 --> 00:33:16,059
Or just leave it.

336
00:33:16,093 --> 00:33:17,695
Sell it?

337
00:33:17,728 --> 00:33:20,131
Who'd buy that?

338
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:26,304
Hello.

339
00:33:29,605 --> 00:33:30,740
Hello there.

340
00:33:30,773 --> 00:33:32,509
Hello there.

341
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:34,544
It's a nice day.

342
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,649
Everett got himself a woman?

343
00:33:38,682 --> 00:33:40,151
Get back in the house.

344
00:33:40,183 --> 00:33:43,153
What's this now?

345
00:33:40,183 --> 00:33:43,153
Ah, she works for me.

346
00:33:43,186 --> 00:33:46,589
Need somebody to mind the house,
else I get robbed.

347
00:33:46,623 --> 00:33:48,092
So you got yourself

348
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:50,126
a tiny, little woman
to guard your house?

349
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,596
Couldn't you get
a meaner dog?

350
00:33:52,628 --> 00:33:54,164
Or a gun?

351
00:33:56,165 --> 00:33:59,403
Wait.

352
00:33:59,435 --> 00:34:00,804
Come here.

353
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:04,274
I'm Frank. I'm the fisherman
he tries to cheat every day.

354
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:08,144
He wouldn't cheat you.

355
00:34:08,177 --> 00:34:09,612
He's a good man.

356
00:34:09,646 --> 00:34:12,516
Oh, so-- So you don't
know him well, I see.

357
00:34:12,548 --> 00:34:13,684
Yeah.

358
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:16,720
I'm Maud.

359
00:34:16,753 --> 00:34:18,556
Dowley.

360
00:34:18,588 --> 00:34:21,157
Well,
it's nice to meet you.

361
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,859
Nice to meet you.

362
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:25,695
So you're
working here, then.

363
00:34:25,728 --> 00:34:27,530
Yeah. I'm-- I'm living--

364
00:34:27,563 --> 00:34:29,165
That's enough.

365
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,137
So you got yourself
a live-in maid, do you?

366
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,172
Out all day. Work hard.

367
00:34:35,204 --> 00:34:36,773
I deserve to come home
to a clean house.

368
00:34:36,806 --> 00:34:39,209
Don't I?

369
00:34:39,242 --> 00:34:41,478
Where do you fit?

370
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:45,483
There's more room in there
than you think.

371
00:34:46,682 --> 00:34:48,818
We find it cozy
in there, don't we?

372
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:54,858
Get back in the house!

373
00:35:20,684 --> 00:35:22,386
I'm in charge of this house.

374
00:35:22,418 --> 00:35:25,655
If she don't know it,
she'll learn it.

375
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,562
Nobody in their right mind

376
00:35:31,594 --> 00:35:33,263
would put up
with that for very long.

377
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,798
Well, she's not
in her right mind.

378
00:35:34,831 --> 00:35:37,168
That's one thing I know.

379
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:28,719
Learned your lesson?

380
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,693
Do you want me here
or don't you?

381
00:36:39,963 --> 00:36:42,900
Because I'll go.

382
00:36:42,932 --> 00:36:46,369
I'll walk out right now.

383
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:50,574
Well, do you
want me here or not?

384
00:36:54,344 --> 00:36:57,215
I'd like my pay, please.

385
00:36:58,414 --> 00:37:01,384
You haven't paid me yet,
not once.

386
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:09,626
Two months.

387
00:37:10,793 --> 00:37:12,462
Yeah, aye.

388
00:38:24,534 --> 00:38:27,305
Hello?

389
00:38:28,505 --> 00:38:30,673
Anybody home?

390
00:38:32,108 --> 00:38:33,710
Hello?

391
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:42,353
Are you
the fish peddler's wife?

392
00:38:42,385 --> 00:38:45,922
Some snazzy shoes there.

393
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:52,563
No. Sorry.

394
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:54,831
Well, is he around?

395
00:38:56,699 --> 00:38:59,836
He's-- He's out
on his rounds.

396
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:03,473
I paid for fish,
and he never delivered.

397
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:06,610
Oh, well...

398
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:10,146
sometimes he forgets.

399
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:12,715
I paid him,
plus a handsome tip.

400
00:39:12,748 --> 00:39:15,551
Now, I'm here from New York City
for the next few months

401
00:39:15,585 --> 00:39:19,990
and I can give him
my business or not.

402
00:39:20,023 --> 00:39:24,728
You-- You sure he never
dropped off the fish?

403
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,864
May-- Maybe a dog
ran off with it.

404
00:39:26,896 --> 00:39:30,433
I don't have a dog.

405
00:39:26,896 --> 00:39:30,433
Or a cat.

406
00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:32,603
Cats love fish.

407
00:39:32,635 --> 00:39:34,938
I don't have
a cat either.

408
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:39,175
Well...

409
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:41,778
Well, I'll tell him
you came by.

410
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:45,615
Say...

411
00:39:45,648 --> 00:39:46,916
Yeah?

412
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:49,919
Did you paint that happy,
little chicken?

413
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:53,791
Actually, yeah.

414
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:57,126
There was a chicken
out in the yard.

415
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:59,663
Real fat.

416
00:40:00,896 --> 00:40:03,666
I wanted to remember
his happier days, so...

417
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:07,471
painted him.

418
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:11,108
Well...

419
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:14,478
I'll tell him to square up
with you when he gets home.

420
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,947
I'd appreciate that.

421
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,784
What's your name?

422
00:40:21,818 --> 00:40:24,922
Maud.

423
00:40:24,954 --> 00:40:26,690
Nice to meet you, Maud.

424
00:40:28,557 --> 00:40:30,126
I'm Sandra.

425
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:32,929
Nice to meet you, Sandra.

426
00:40:37,766 --> 00:40:41,838
Hey, those
snazzy shoes...

427
00:40:41,871 --> 00:40:43,706
They comfy?

428
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:47,076
Ah...they're not bad.

429
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:50,646
No. They're not bad.

430
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:52,982
All the way
from New York City.

431
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:59,282
Who told you you could paint
fairies on the wall, huh?

432
00:41:59,315 --> 00:42:01,551
They're not fairies.

433
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:04,153
They're birds.

434
00:42:04,186 --> 00:42:07,156
Well, who told you
you could do that, huh?

435
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,825
Well, you did.

436
00:42:08,858 --> 00:42:11,862
What?

437
00:42:08,858 --> 00:42:11,862
You said-- You said:

438
00:42:11,894 --> 00:42:14,030
"Make the place look
all right."

439
00:42:14,063 --> 00:42:16,666
I think
it looks all right.

440
00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:19,802
No painting
in this corner, huh?

441
00:42:19,835 --> 00:42:22,305
I don't want paint on my boots.
No paint on my gear.

442
00:42:22,338 --> 00:42:25,775
The rest is fine.

443
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:29,046
Birds or fairies,
I don't mind.

444
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:31,815
I won't do that.

445
00:42:52,702 --> 00:42:54,705
Good?

446
00:42:56,271 --> 00:42:59,375
Long day?

447
00:43:01,244 --> 00:43:05,916
Must be hard running
a business.

448
00:43:05,949 --> 00:43:11,621
My brother Charles used to run
one of them jazz clubs

449
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,157
for a while.

450
00:43:14,757 --> 00:43:20,129
People always on his back
for money he owed them.

451
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:25,802
I never owe
nobody nothing.

452
00:43:25,835 --> 00:43:28,137
Charles said
the same thing.

453
00:43:29,438 --> 00:43:32,141
Couldn't prove it, you see.

454
00:43:33,242 --> 00:43:35,344
People are stupid.

455
00:43:35,378 --> 00:43:37,014
You're not.

456
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,048
You keep track
of it all in your head.

457
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:43,819
Most people can't,
you see.

458
00:43:43,853 --> 00:43:47,257
That's why you gotta
write it all down.

459
00:43:47,289 --> 00:43:50,927
I can write it down
for you, if you like.

460
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,831
I'm good at writing.

461
00:43:57,032 --> 00:43:58,402
So...

462
00:43:58,434 --> 00:44:01,270
Who

463
00:44:01,304 --> 00:44:03,106
owes

464
00:44:03,139 --> 00:44:05,041
Everett

465
00:44:06,342 --> 00:44:08,412
Lewis?

466
00:44:11,114 --> 00:44:12,249
Donovan.

467
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,117
Donovan.

468
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:17,054
Donovan.

469
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:17,054
Owes me for six fish.

470
00:44:17,086 --> 00:44:19,222
Six fish.

471
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,065
That is a bird.

472
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,065
What?

473
00:44:28,097 --> 00:44:32,134
That, I don't know what that is,
but it's not a bird.

474
00:44:32,168 --> 00:44:34,003
That is finished.

475
00:44:34,036 --> 00:44:36,172
It's got
a beak on it.

476
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:40,277
That ain't got
no beak on it yet.

477
00:46:28,617 --> 00:46:31,154
Are you gonna do that?

478
00:46:32,088 --> 00:46:34,992
Are we ready to get married?

479
00:46:39,295 --> 00:46:41,331
Costs money.

480
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:46,836
Foolish.

481
00:46:48,204 --> 00:46:51,341
Only if you invite people
and stuff.

482
00:46:51,373 --> 00:46:53,810
Give them supper.

483
00:46:55,945 --> 00:47:00,317
You gotta pay a fee
for a license.

484
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:04,221
Yep.

485
00:47:04,253 --> 00:47:06,121
Charles had
a fancy wedding.

486
00:47:06,155 --> 00:47:08,490
I thought
I wouldn't do that.

487
00:47:08,523 --> 00:47:10,993
I'd do it cheap.

488
00:47:11,027 --> 00:47:13,195
Wouldn't invite anyone.

489
00:47:13,228 --> 00:47:16,232
Wouldn't do what Charles did.

490
00:47:13,228 --> 00:47:16,232
Why you talking about him?

491
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:20,936
Well, you plan on doing
what you're doing,

492
00:47:20,969 --> 00:47:23,339
think
we should get married.

493
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:27,110
I don't wanna get
in that sort of trouble again.

494
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:32,149
What kind of trouble?

495
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:37,855
I had a baby.

496
00:47:40,623 --> 00:47:43,226
Baby died.

497
00:47:44,527 --> 00:47:47,264
She was real deformed.

498
00:47:49,231 --> 00:47:52,001
They buried her when...

499
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:58,174
When I was sleeping.

500
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,706
Here.

501
00:49:03,739 --> 00:49:06,508
You wanted
three fish.

502
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:08,510
I owed you for two.

503
00:49:08,543 --> 00:49:09,679
So...

504
00:49:09,711 --> 00:49:11,480
now you owe me for one.

505
00:49:11,514 --> 00:49:13,182
It's a card.

506
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:16,518
Well, we-- We figured it out
on the card.

507
00:49:16,552 --> 00:49:18,355
We're rendering accounts.

508
00:49:18,387 --> 00:49:23,960
So, you know,
it won't be a mix-up.

509
00:49:27,329 --> 00:49:29,333
And how do I know
this is right?

510
00:49:30,632 --> 00:49:33,002
Because I said.

511
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:38,708
We could maybe start clean
from now on.

512
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,577
Keep track.

513
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:44,614
Maybe.

514
00:49:44,646 --> 00:49:47,284
Give me a moment.

515
00:49:52,621 --> 00:49:55,491
I am the boss.

516
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:57,626
Yeah, you. I know that.

517
00:49:57,659 --> 00:49:59,094
Who's in charge?

518
00:49:59,128 --> 00:50:01,664
You are.

519
00:49:59,128 --> 00:50:01,664
I bring in the money.

520
00:50:01,697 --> 00:50:03,066
Right?

521
00:50:01,697 --> 00:50:03,066
Yeah.

522
00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:04,300
Yeah, so who's
in charge?

523
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:06,235
Yeah. You are.

524
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:06,235
Yeah. Right.

525
00:50:06,268 --> 00:50:08,103
Don't forget it.

526
00:50:06,268 --> 00:50:08,103
Yeah.

527
00:50:08,137 --> 00:50:10,273
I can't--
Can't forget it.

528
00:50:11,773 --> 00:50:16,212
I'll pay you, if you make me
some more of these cards.

529
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:23,419
I don't know.

530
00:50:24,686 --> 00:50:27,156
He's in charge, so...

531
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:30,427
ask him.

532
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:40,836
Throw in
an extra 5 cents?

533
00:50:40,869 --> 00:50:43,172
How about 10 cents a card?

534
00:50:45,373 --> 00:50:47,743
Sounds good. Suits me.

535
00:50:47,777 --> 00:50:49,545
Good.

536
00:50:52,114 --> 00:50:54,583
And I'll take my fish.

537
00:50:54,617 --> 00:50:58,388
I look forward
to these cards very much.

538
00:51:01,289 --> 00:51:03,360
Thanks. See what I can do.

539
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:09,066
Wait up. You're good, Ev.

540
00:51:10,465 --> 00:51:11,768
You know?

541
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,237
Really know what you're doing.

542
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:18,508
Asking for that money.

543
00:51:22,744 --> 00:51:24,780
Pretty house.

544
00:51:24,813 --> 00:51:26,248
Pretty house.

545
00:51:26,282 --> 00:51:28,617
Let's get her
in second gear now.

546
00:51:34,757 --> 00:51:37,159
She liked my card.

547
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,576
Hey, kettle's on.

548
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:28,912
Cup of tea?

549
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:31,414
Come in.

550
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:31,414
Sure.

551
00:52:49,632 --> 00:52:51,400
I got it here for you.

552
00:52:53,501 --> 00:52:55,938
You got--? Got--?
Got any boards?

553
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:58,274
Take a look around.

554
00:53:55,364 --> 00:53:57,500
Good morning.

555
00:53:58,534 --> 00:54:01,371
Well, three more.

556
00:54:02,771 --> 00:54:04,907
I don't know why people
pay money for these.

557
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:07,844
My 5-year-old
could do better.

558
00:54:07,876 --> 00:54:09,612
Maybe.

559
00:54:09,644 --> 00:54:12,347
Maybe he could,
but he didn't. Maud did.

560
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:14,317
Brushes, please.

561
00:54:15,617 --> 00:54:18,255
Well,
you're an idiot.

562
00:54:19,954 --> 00:54:21,857
You're an idiot.

563
00:54:24,659 --> 00:54:27,396
Stupid.

564
00:54:27,429 --> 00:54:29,431
Know-it-all.

565
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:54,356
Whoever it is,

566
00:54:54,389 --> 00:54:56,391
you tell them to get.
Get out.

567
00:54:56,425 --> 00:54:57,794
Get out?

568
00:54:56,425 --> 00:54:57,794
Yeah.

569
00:54:57,827 --> 00:54:59,362
Yeah.

570
00:54:59,394 --> 00:55:01,831
It's suppertime.

571
00:54:59,394 --> 00:55:01,831
Yeah.

572
00:55:01,864 --> 00:55:03,099
I don't know.

573
00:55:06,969 --> 00:55:09,539
Yeah.

574
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,875
Hello.

575
00:55:13,909 --> 00:55:15,044
Hello.

576
00:55:15,077 --> 00:55:16,846
May I come in?

577
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:21,417
Well, we're...

578
00:55:21,449 --> 00:55:22,684
Come in.

579
00:55:22,717 --> 00:55:25,420
Oh, thank you, Maud.

580
00:55:25,454 --> 00:55:26,956
Would you like a bowl of soup?

581
00:55:26,989 --> 00:55:29,057
Oh, no, thank you.

582
00:55:26,989 --> 00:55:29,057
No?

583
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:31,327
Here. Sit down.

584
00:55:32,661 --> 00:55:36,099
Like a cup of tea?

585
00:55:32,661 --> 00:55:36,099
I'm fine, Maud.

586
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:38,835
The reason I'm here is,

587
00:55:38,867 --> 00:55:42,739
I'd like to see
one of your larger paintings.

588
00:55:44,806 --> 00:55:46,908
Oh, well, heh.

589
00:55:46,942 --> 00:55:50,445
Well, I-- I don't do
larger paintings.

590
00:55:50,478 --> 00:55:51,646
Just the little cards.

591
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:53,615
I'm willing to pay
your price.

592
00:55:53,648 --> 00:55:55,451
Yeah, she does.

593
00:55:55,483 --> 00:55:59,489
Yup, we got some fine gobs
of paint here,

594
00:55:59,521 --> 00:56:01,056
splashed on these boards.

595
00:55:59,521 --> 00:56:01,056
No.

596
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:03,593
Yeah, these will be
right up your alley.

597
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:07,096
There.

598
00:56:07,128 --> 00:56:08,864
Look at that.

599
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:11,867
It's a lovely winter scene.

600
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:11,867
There's some deer.

601
00:56:13,969 --> 00:56:16,373
Well...

602
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:19,509
Isn't she beautiful?

603
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:22,612
Yeah, I haven't
finished it.

604
00:56:22,644 --> 00:56:24,614
And this tree has red leaves.

605
00:56:24,646 --> 00:56:27,016
This one has green.

606
00:56:27,048 --> 00:56:28,583
What season is it?

607
00:56:28,617 --> 00:56:32,021
Uh, well,
I guess it's--

608
00:56:33,789 --> 00:56:36,459
It's everything that's
pretty about all the seasons.

609
00:56:36,492 --> 00:56:37,693
Yes, it is.

610
00:56:37,726 --> 00:56:39,561
Well, how much, hm?

611
00:56:39,594 --> 00:56:41,196
How much?

612
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:43,432
No.

613
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:43,432
What's your price?

614
00:56:43,465 --> 00:56:45,601
Five dollars.

615
00:56:45,634 --> 00:56:47,135
Done.

616
00:56:45,634 --> 00:56:47,135
Done.

617
00:56:47,168 --> 00:56:48,837
No. No.

618
00:56:48,871 --> 00:56:51,541
Uh, I'm not--
I'm not selling it.

619
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:52,974
It's all right.

620
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:52,974
Yeah.

621
00:56:53,007 --> 00:56:54,743
No.

622
00:56:54,777 --> 00:56:57,512
I'm not selling that one.

623
00:56:54,777 --> 00:56:57,512
Already sold.

624
00:56:57,545 --> 00:56:59,648
I haven't finished it.

625
00:57:00,815 --> 00:57:03,752
I have-- I haven't finished it.

626
00:57:04,887 --> 00:57:08,658
Well, I was just pulling
your leg now.

627
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:11,827
It's a joke.
This one's not for sale.

628
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:22,672
You know, I have
an even better idea.

629
00:57:22,704 --> 00:57:27,242
Why don't I commission you
to paint me something?

630
00:57:27,275 --> 00:57:30,545
You can paint me anything
on a board, just like that.

631
00:57:30,579 --> 00:57:33,149
Just whatever you want.

632
00:57:33,181 --> 00:57:35,817
And I'll pay you for it.

633
00:57:35,851 --> 00:57:39,555
You can send it
to me in New York.

634
00:57:39,588 --> 00:57:42,525
Show me
how you see the world.

635
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:46,528
For five dollars?

636
00:57:46,561 --> 00:57:49,065
Five dollars.

637
00:57:49,097 --> 00:57:51,833
Uh, to New York?

638
00:57:51,867 --> 00:57:55,972
That's a long way.
Does that include postage?

639
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:01,077
Thank you. Goodbye.

640
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:01,077
Goodbye, Maud.

641
00:58:04,146 --> 00:58:05,581
Sandra.

642
00:58:05,614 --> 00:58:07,250
Sandra.

643
00:58:07,282 --> 00:58:09,851
You guys are
best friends, huh?

644
00:58:12,253 --> 00:58:14,723
S-- Sold a painting.

645
00:58:18,827 --> 00:58:20,997
Better get painting.

646
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,266
Dishes come first, yeah?

647
00:58:23,298 --> 00:58:25,534
Six dollars.

648
00:58:23,298 --> 00:58:25,534
Yeah.

649
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:27,036
Boy, she's an idiot.

650
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,874
Give her one
of the ones you already done.

651
00:58:31,907 --> 00:58:34,544
No, I wouldn't do that.

652
00:58:45,253 --> 00:58:46,588
Everett?

653
00:58:50,192 --> 00:58:52,027
Do you like 'em?

654
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:53,296
My paintings?

655
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:57,633
How am I supposed
to know, hm?

656
00:58:57,666 --> 00:58:59,635
Do I look like
a woman? Hm?

657
00:58:59,668 --> 00:59:02,539
No. Heh.

658
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:07,108
But I know what that is.

659
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:07,108
It's a cat.

660
00:59:07,141 --> 00:59:09,678
No. That's my name.

661
00:59:11,847 --> 00:59:13,649
What's my name doing there?

662
00:59:13,681 --> 00:59:17,752
Well, you know...

663
00:59:17,786 --> 00:59:21,657
figured we're
in business together.

664
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:22,992
The painting's half yours.

665
00:59:23,025 --> 00:59:25,161
Your name
should be on it too.

666
00:59:32,233 --> 00:59:35,003
Well...

667
00:59:35,036 --> 00:59:37,639
Not forgetting about
your housework now, are you?

668
00:59:37,672 --> 00:59:41,076
No. No chance of that.

669
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:44,814
I just gotta finish
this one first.

670
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:46,349
You don't wanna neglect
your chores.

671
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:47,951
I won't.

672
00:59:56,257 --> 00:59:59,127
Well...

673
00:59:59,161 --> 01:00:01,097
I'll do the sweeping,

674
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:04,266
but I'm not
doing everything. Hm?

675
01:00:04,298 --> 01:00:07,836
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no.

676
01:00:07,869 --> 01:00:11,339
You'll get dust on it.
It's not dry.

677
01:00:11,373 --> 01:00:13,309
It's still wet.

678
01:00:13,342 --> 01:00:15,945
Do that,
close the door.

679
01:00:22,184 --> 01:00:25,221
You tell me
when you're finished.

680
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:05,186
No, no.

681
01:02:05,219 --> 01:02:07,055
Why?

682
01:02:05,219 --> 01:02:07,055
No.

683
01:02:07,088 --> 01:02:10,925
You're trying to claw your way
into my life like that.

684
01:02:10,958 --> 01:02:13,828
Well, then you're wrong.

685
01:02:13,862 --> 01:02:16,164
As soon as you stop
doing your work,

686
01:02:16,197 --> 01:02:18,734
then you're out
on your duff.

687
01:02:20,101 --> 01:02:22,504
I'd rather stick it
into a tree.

688
01:02:49,331 --> 01:02:51,834
Want some tea?

689
01:02:51,867 --> 01:02:53,502
Not your tea.

690
01:02:56,871 --> 01:02:58,907
Well...

691
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:01,009
if you don't know
what I'm like by now,

692
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:04,113
then you are stupider
than you look.

693
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:11,987
We live together.
We lay down together.

694
01:03:12,019 --> 01:03:13,822
Why not
get married?

695
01:03:16,224 --> 01:03:19,894
Just because I don't have
women banging down my door

696
01:03:19,927 --> 01:03:22,463
doesn't mean I gotta marry
first one comes along.

697
01:03:22,496 --> 01:03:26,034
We've been living together
for some time now.

698
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:27,836
That's what
most people do.

699
01:03:29,637 --> 01:03:31,172
I don't like most people.

700
01:03:31,206 --> 01:03:34,376
They don't like you.

701
01:03:35,911 --> 01:03:37,880
It's true.

702
01:03:40,382 --> 01:03:42,952
I like you.

703
01:03:47,322 --> 01:03:49,291
You need me.

704
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:54,056
Hey.

705
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:54,056
Hey.

706
01:04:57,626 --> 01:05:00,028
You look nice.

707
01:05:11,005 --> 01:05:14,042
Thank you.

708
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,543
Well, I don't know

709
01:05:15,577 --> 01:05:18,147
if I should offer
congratulations or condolences,

710
01:05:18,179 --> 01:05:20,515
but give us a hug, Maud.

711
01:05:23,585 --> 01:05:25,554
And you.

712
01:05:25,586 --> 01:05:27,021
Be nice.

713
01:05:27,054 --> 01:05:30,225
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

714
01:05:50,545 --> 01:05:53,182
It's not crooked enough.

715
01:06:11,166 --> 01:06:13,402
I'm still gonna be contrary
tomorrow.

716
01:06:13,434 --> 01:06:15,503
Yeah.

717
01:06:15,536 --> 01:06:17,272
I know.

718
01:06:23,144 --> 01:06:25,646
We're like a pair of...

719
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:28,384
odd socks.

720
01:06:32,119 --> 01:06:36,759
And I'm the stretched-out,
misshapen one.

721
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:38,494
The one with lots of holes.

722
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:40,095
No.

723
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:40,095
Yeah.

724
01:06:40,128 --> 01:06:41,497
Crusty and gray.

725
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:43,399
No.

726
01:06:51,639 --> 01:06:53,608
And I'm...

727
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:59,015
the plain,
white cotton sock.

728
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:01,215
Yeah.

729
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:01,215
No.

730
01:07:01,248 --> 01:07:04,385
You'd be...

731
01:07:04,418 --> 01:07:06,422
royal blue.

732
01:07:07,688 --> 01:07:10,058
Canary yellow.

733
01:07:57,371 --> 01:08:00,108
Wiseass.

734
01:08:00,141 --> 01:08:01,710
That's better.

735
01:08:01,742 --> 01:08:03,144
Yeah, yeah.

736
01:08:03,177 --> 01:08:05,146
Yeah. No, over. No.

737
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:08,317
Yeah. There you are.

738
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:08,317
It's okay?

739
01:08:11,652 --> 01:08:13,154
Don't nail it.

740
01:08:13,188 --> 01:08:14,590
No, not gonna--
Not gonna nail it.

741
01:08:14,623 --> 01:08:17,725
Just don't want it
to fall over.

742
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:19,494
There we go.

743
01:08:21,529 --> 01:08:22,730
There we go.

744
01:08:22,764 --> 01:08:26,368
I can see you.

745
01:08:22,764 --> 01:08:26,368
Yeah, I see you.

746
01:08:36,744 --> 01:08:38,346
Good?

747
01:09:19,554 --> 01:09:24,458
"Her paintings can be found
on display at her home

748
01:09:24,492 --> 01:09:28,697
"in Marshalltown,
Nova Scotia,

749
01:09:28,729 --> 01:09:33,601
where she lives with
her husband, Everett Lewis."

750
01:09:33,635 --> 01:09:37,972
See? Do mention you
in here.

751
01:09:38,006 --> 01:09:39,841
Let me see that.

752
01:09:39,873 --> 01:09:42,277
"A local fish peddler."

753
01:09:43,811 --> 01:09:46,347
"Everett Lewis.

754
01:09:47,849 --> 01:09:49,551
A local
fish peddler."

755
01:09:49,583 --> 01:09:51,987
There it is.

756
01:09:49,583 --> 01:09:51,987
There you are.

757
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:07,536
Can I help you?

758
01:10:11,972 --> 01:10:13,341
Charles?

759
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:14,643
Sister.

760
01:10:18,279 --> 01:10:19,547
What are you
doing here?

761
01:10:19,581 --> 01:10:22,551
Well, I heard--
Read about you.

762
01:10:22,583 --> 01:10:25,220
Wanted to come
see for myself.

763
01:10:27,322 --> 01:10:28,757
An artist, huh?

764
01:10:28,789 --> 01:10:31,326
You never called me an artist
when we were young.

765
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:34,496
No different now.

766
01:10:34,529 --> 01:10:36,832
Want a cup of tea,
Charles?

767
01:10:36,864 --> 01:10:38,300
Oh, no, no.

768
01:10:38,332 --> 01:10:39,600
Thank you for asking,
though.

769
01:10:39,634 --> 01:10:42,404
So, uh, where's your, uh...?

770
01:10:43,637 --> 01:10:45,573
Your man?

771
01:10:46,573 --> 01:10:48,676
Out on his rounds,
I suppose.

772
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:50,545
Be back soon,
if you wanna meet him.

773
01:10:50,578 --> 01:10:53,482
Oh, I don't have much time.
I just wanted to...

774
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:57,552
come by and maybe get one
of your paintings, huh?

775
01:10:57,585 --> 01:10:58,886
Yeah.

776
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:01,489
Aunt Ida said you don't see
a nickel of money

777
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:02,824
from these paintings.

778
01:11:02,856 --> 01:11:04,760
That right?

779
01:11:02,856 --> 01:11:04,760
Yeah.

780
01:11:04,792 --> 01:11:06,795
What's he doing
with your money, Maud?

781
01:11:06,828 --> 01:11:09,431
Why isn't he building
onto the house?

782
01:11:09,463 --> 01:11:11,065
Getting the place wired?

783
01:11:11,099 --> 01:11:13,001
Why would he wanna
do that?

784
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:18,307
It's his house.
His choice.

785
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:20,375
Yeah,
but you're capable

786
01:11:20,408 --> 01:11:22,377
of making decisions,
aren't you, Maud?

787
01:11:22,409 --> 01:11:24,412
Oh, yes.

788
01:11:22,409 --> 01:11:24,412
Yeah?

789
01:11:24,445 --> 01:11:25,881
Yes, I am.

790
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:30,485
You know, Maud,

791
01:11:30,518 --> 01:11:32,487
you need someone
to give you advice

792
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,556
on how to handle
your money.

793
01:11:34,588 --> 01:11:36,925
Someone a little more
savvy than him.

794
01:11:36,957 --> 01:11:38,693
Someone who--

795
01:11:36,957 --> 01:11:38,693
Like you?

796
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:41,930
Well,
I know money, yeah.

797
01:11:41,962 --> 01:11:44,332
You know debt.

798
01:11:44,365 --> 01:11:46,600
Selling Mom's house.

799
01:11:46,634 --> 01:11:48,936
You like money too much,
Charles.

800
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:51,573
Hello.

801
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:51,573
Everett.

802
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:56,677
My brother, Charles.

803
01:11:56,711 --> 01:11:58,314
Hello.

804
01:12:05,052 --> 01:12:06,688
He come to buy
a painting.

805
01:12:07,721 --> 01:12:10,425
Just, uh,
which one, huh?

806
01:12:10,457 --> 01:12:12,594
Big ones are $5.

807
01:12:12,627 --> 01:12:14,897
Are you gonna buy one,
or what?

808
01:12:17,998 --> 01:12:20,903
Yeah. Just grab one.

809
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:25,106
That one's $6.

810
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,776
Price gone up.

811
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,776
Six?

812
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:32,914
I only...

813
01:12:37,551 --> 01:12:39,854
It's-- It's lovely.

814
01:12:39,887 --> 01:12:42,390
Bye, Charles.

815
01:12:42,423 --> 01:12:45,360
Goodbye, sister.

816
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:07,783
Get out.

817
01:13:10,685 --> 01:13:13,522
Got a letter today.

818
01:13:16,056 --> 01:13:18,793
From Vice President Nixon.

819
01:13:22,529 --> 01:13:24,832
What'd he want?

820
01:13:24,865 --> 01:13:26,100
A painting.

821
01:13:26,134 --> 01:13:27,802
A painting?

822
01:13:29,503 --> 01:13:33,140
Unless he sends money
for a painting,

823
01:13:33,173 --> 01:13:35,411
won't send him any.

824
01:13:36,711 --> 01:13:37,913
Good.

825
01:13:37,945 --> 01:13:39,613
That's good.

826
01:13:39,646 --> 01:13:42,451
Maybe then we can afford
a screen door.

827
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:45,487
Don't need
a screen door.

828
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,856
I'm the one working
14 hours a day

829
01:13:47,889 --> 01:13:50,792
so you can just sit there
in the corner and paint away.

830
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:54,563
My paintings earn money.

831
01:13:54,595 --> 01:13:56,964
Yeah.
Bring in a few pennies.

832
01:13:56,997 --> 01:14:00,501
But I'm the one
doing all the work.

833
01:14:00,534 --> 01:14:02,069
Right?

834
01:14:02,103 --> 01:14:03,538
Yeah.

835
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:04,939
You can't even
keep the fire going.

836
01:14:04,972 --> 01:14:07,074
I want a cup of tea
when I get home.

837
01:14:07,108 --> 01:14:09,543
Gets hot in here in the day.

838
01:14:09,577 --> 01:14:10,945
Yeah, so?
Open the door.

839
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:12,914
Then the flies get in.

840
01:14:14,649 --> 01:14:16,618
That's why we need
a screen door.

841
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:19,454
No screen door.

842
01:15:26,119 --> 01:15:29,323
Can I get you to hold it up
a little bit higher, please?

843
01:15:29,356 --> 01:15:31,560
Thank you.

844
01:15:31,592 --> 01:15:33,060
All right.

845
01:15:33,094 --> 01:15:35,963
How long did it take you
to make this painting, Maud?

846
01:15:37,198 --> 01:15:40,201
Two-- Two or three days.

847
01:15:40,234 --> 01:15:42,270
Two days? Two or three days,
yes?

848
01:15:42,302 --> 01:15:44,905
Do you enjoy painting?

849
01:15:42,302 --> 01:15:44,905
Oh, yes.

850
01:15:44,939 --> 01:15:47,342
I've been doing it
all my life.

851
01:15:47,375 --> 01:15:49,644
Mr. Lewis,
come out, please.

852
01:15:49,676 --> 01:15:52,279
Join us.

853
01:15:52,313 --> 01:15:56,217
Can I get you to look towards
the camera this way, Mr. Lewis?

854
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:57,752
And smile, maybe?

855
01:15:57,784 --> 01:15:59,119
Nice. Thank you.

856
01:15:59,153 --> 01:16:01,088
Now, you've painted
most of the house.

857
01:16:01,122 --> 01:16:05,193
Well, I started with the birds
and the flowers.

858
01:16:05,225 --> 01:16:06,827
Over there.

859
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:11,065
And he didn't tell me
to stop, so...

860
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:12,199
kept going.

861
01:16:13,701 --> 01:16:15,002
Everett, you must feel
very lucky

862
01:16:15,036 --> 01:16:17,706
to have Maud
as your wife.

863
01:16:19,907 --> 01:16:22,277
<i> Maud Lewis has been an artist
most of her life.</i>

864
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:25,146
Her paintings have even been
sold to Vice President Nixon.

865
01:16:25,179 --> 01:16:27,282
<i> This happy couple,
who only live</i>

866
01:16:27,314 --> 01:16:29,083
<i> with the bare necessities
of life,</i>

867
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:30,885
<i> and yet somehow,
they flourish.</i>

868
01:16:30,917 --> 01:16:33,220
<i>I chop the wood.</i>

869
01:16:33,253 --> 01:16:36,957
<i> I do the dishes.
Now all she does is paint.</i>

870
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:39,360
<i>Paint a picture a day.</i>

871
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:41,363
<i> Paint all seasons.</i>

872
01:16:41,395 --> 01:16:44,264
<i>I told her a wife is supposed
to mind her husband.</i>

873
01:16:44,297 --> 01:16:46,333
<i> She does as she likes.</i>

874
01:16:46,367 --> 01:16:49,404
<i>Who would have thought
this little, arthritic woman</i>

875
01:16:49,436 --> 01:16:52,841
<i>living on the fringe of society
would have such incredible</i>

876
01:16:52,873 --> 01:16:54,908
<i> and far-reaching success?</i>

877
01:16:54,942 --> 01:16:56,877
<i> You can find Maud Lewis</i>

878
01:16:56,911 --> 01:16:59,047
<i> still selling her paintings
from the front steps</i>

879
01:16:59,079 --> 01:17:03,150
<i> of her little house here
in Marshalltown, Nova Scotia.</i>

880
01:17:15,262 --> 01:17:19,067
Take it easy there, Ida.

881
01:17:15,262 --> 01:17:19,067
Hold my arm. That's it.

882
01:17:20,734 --> 01:17:22,770
There we go.

883
01:17:25,038 --> 01:17:26,807
Door.

884
01:17:30,744 --> 01:17:32,180
I'm good.

885
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:38,019
I saw you.

886
01:17:38,051 --> 01:17:40,421
On the news.

887
01:17:40,454 --> 01:17:42,423
You lucked into it with her,
didn't you?

888
01:17:42,457 --> 01:17:47,429
She's all smiles,
and you nothing but grumbles.

889
01:17:47,462 --> 01:17:49,764
Wait.

890
01:17:49,796 --> 01:17:53,300
I want you to tell her
to come see me.

891
01:17:53,333 --> 01:17:55,037
Please.

892
01:18:08,115 --> 01:18:11,185
I can do it.
I can do it. Go.

893
01:18:15,222 --> 01:18:18,726
<i>Never you mind
about how sick she was.</i>

894
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:21,429
I asked you a question.
What--?

895
01:18:21,462 --> 01:18:23,398
Oh, what?

896
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:26,467
Was I nasty on the TV?

897
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:28,036
No, Everett.

898
01:18:28,069 --> 01:18:32,073
Well, everyone's giving me
queer looks.

899
01:18:32,105 --> 01:18:35,242
Talking about me
behind my back.

900
01:18:35,275 --> 01:18:37,377
Never mind what other people
are doing.

901
01:18:37,411 --> 01:18:40,215
Everyone thinks
you're as sweet as pie.

902
01:18:40,247 --> 01:18:44,885
They don't know. They don't know
what you're like to live with.

903
01:18:44,918 --> 01:18:46,186
Is that right?

904
01:18:44,918 --> 01:18:46,186
Yeah.

905
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:48,757
Get up.

906
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:48,757
What? Where are we going?

907
01:18:48,789 --> 01:18:50,492
Get up.

908
01:18:48,789 --> 01:18:50,492
Where are we going?

909
01:18:50,524 --> 01:18:52,025
Aunt Ida's.

910
01:18:52,059 --> 01:18:53,194
No.

911
01:18:53,226 --> 01:18:55,430
Yeah.

912
01:18:53,226 --> 01:18:55,430
Putting my foot down.

913
01:18:55,462 --> 01:18:57,297
Not going.

914
01:18:57,331 --> 01:18:58,500
What?

915
01:18:58,533 --> 01:19:01,202
Everett!

916
01:19:01,234 --> 01:19:04,005
What if she dies and I didn't
get to say goodbye, huh?

917
01:19:04,037 --> 01:19:05,839
What if I die
and you're not here,

918
01:19:05,872 --> 01:19:08,509
and you didn't
get to say goodbye?

919
01:19:08,542 --> 01:19:10,110
You're being silly.

920
01:19:10,144 --> 01:19:12,413
No. Not taking you.

921
01:19:10,144 --> 01:19:12,413
I don't need you.

922
01:19:12,445 --> 01:19:14,114
I can get there
on my own.

923
01:19:14,148 --> 01:19:16,551
You don't even-- You don't even
know how to drive.

924
01:19:16,583 --> 01:19:18,819
Well, no.

925
01:19:18,853 --> 01:19:20,922
I know how to walk.

926
01:19:20,954 --> 01:19:22,757
Give me that.

927
01:19:54,588 --> 01:19:57,993
Good to see you, Ida.

928
01:20:01,362 --> 01:20:03,898
I watched you on the TV.

929
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:05,933
Did you?

930
01:20:05,966 --> 01:20:08,836
What did you think?

931
01:20:08,869 --> 01:20:14,341
You're the only one in our
family who ended up happy.

932
01:20:16,109 --> 01:20:18,445
Well...

933
01:20:18,479 --> 01:20:20,914
Yeah, suppose I did.

934
01:20:25,386 --> 01:20:27,622
I don't wanna die...

935
01:20:27,654 --> 01:20:29,323
full of regrets.

936
01:20:29,356 --> 01:20:31,592
Yeah, I know.

937
01:20:31,626 --> 01:20:33,360
I know.

938
01:20:36,663 --> 01:20:39,166
I regret...

939
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:42,369
not letting you hold her,
at least.

940
01:20:44,939 --> 01:20:46,941
What's that?

941
01:20:46,974 --> 01:20:48,909
Your baby.

942
01:20:53,146 --> 01:20:54,349
I know.

943
01:20:54,381 --> 01:20:57,618
You did it to protect me.
I know that.

944
01:20:57,652 --> 01:21:01,088
You know, she was...

945
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:04,459
real deformed,
so, you know.

946
01:21:04,492 --> 01:21:06,862
She wasn't deformed.

947
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:12,100
She wasn't deformed?

948
01:21:12,132 --> 01:21:16,170
Why'd she die, huh?

949
01:21:17,704 --> 01:21:19,373
She didn't.

950
01:21:22,342 --> 01:21:23,944
What?

951
01:21:23,978 --> 01:21:25,913
Charles sold her.

952
01:21:30,685 --> 01:21:32,987
He did what?

953
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:36,224
He sold her to a good home.
Older people.

954
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:40,527
We didn't think that you'd be
able to take care of a child.

955
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,331
Charles and--

956
01:21:43,363 --> 01:21:46,367
And I decided.

957
01:21:48,168 --> 01:21:50,070
I was told she's--

958
01:21:50,104 --> 01:21:53,041
She's been well-loved.

959
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:01,983
Is she crooked or what?

960
01:22:02,716 --> 01:22:05,052
She was fine.

961
01:22:12,726 --> 01:22:14,461
I gotta go now.

962
01:23:16,289 --> 01:23:18,592
Never asked for this.

963
01:23:20,661 --> 01:23:23,331
Get up in the morning.

964
01:23:23,363 --> 01:23:25,500
People.

965
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:27,502
Come home from work.

966
01:23:27,534 --> 01:23:29,403
People.

967
01:23:30,837 --> 01:23:34,509
Got my face on the TV

968
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:36,611
for all the world
to laugh at.

969
01:23:36,644 --> 01:23:41,181
Everett, listen to me. Ida--

970
01:23:36,644 --> 01:23:41,181
No, you listen to me.

971
01:23:41,215 --> 01:23:43,451
You think that you're
too good for me.

972
01:23:43,484 --> 01:23:45,520
That you don't
need me anymore.

973
01:23:45,552 --> 01:23:48,389
Well, that's fine.
You go find someone else.

974
01:23:48,421 --> 01:23:51,125
Fine. If that's what
you want.

975
01:23:51,158 --> 01:23:52,727
My baby, Charles.
They sold her.

976
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:55,063
Give up on that
goddamn baby!

977
01:23:55,095 --> 01:23:58,032
Nothing but that baby,
the brother, the baby!

978
01:24:00,801 --> 01:24:02,470
Nothing but misery.

979
01:24:02,502 --> 01:24:04,404
My brother, my baby.

980
01:24:04,438 --> 01:24:06,440
She lived.

981
01:24:08,876 --> 01:24:11,612
I thought she died.
She lived.

982
01:24:11,645 --> 01:24:13,414
More pain.

983
01:24:13,447 --> 01:24:16,217
Ever since you stepped
into my life.

984
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:18,418
Nothing but pain.

985
01:24:18,452 --> 01:24:21,222
I was better off
without you.

986
01:24:24,425 --> 01:24:26,726
What, are you gonna get out?

987
01:24:24,425 --> 01:24:26,726
Yeah.

988
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,596
Well, good riddance!

989
01:25:34,761 --> 01:25:37,131
Come in, Maud.

990
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:41,469
Thanks.

991
01:25:41,502 --> 01:25:43,338
Sorry.

992
01:26:01,689 --> 01:26:05,693
I've made up a bed
in the spare room.

993
01:26:08,561 --> 01:26:10,430
Thank you.

994
01:26:13,567 --> 01:26:15,369
Thanks.

995
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,275
Maud...

996
01:26:22,309 --> 01:26:25,613
can you teach me
how to paint?

997
01:26:29,315 --> 01:26:31,786
No one can teach that.

998
01:26:33,487 --> 01:26:37,324
If you wanna paint,
you paint, I suppose.

999
01:26:38,425 --> 01:26:40,595
I don't go nowhere, so...

1000
01:26:41,662 --> 01:26:44,465
paint from memory,
I suppose.

1001
01:26:47,967 --> 01:26:50,604
I make my designs up.

1002
01:26:55,309 --> 01:26:58,412
I've known you
for years, Maud.

1003
01:26:58,444 --> 01:26:59,947
Yeah.

1004
01:26:58,444 --> 01:26:59,947
It's true.

1005
01:26:59,979 --> 01:27:01,715
I know.

1006
01:27:01,748 --> 01:27:05,619
And I'm still trying to figure
out what makes you tick.

1007
01:27:09,957 --> 01:27:11,759
Don't know.

1008
01:27:13,627 --> 01:27:17,498
Don't-- I don't want for much,
you know?

1009
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:24,338
As long as I got a brush
in front of me, I don't care.

1010
01:27:28,042 --> 01:27:30,378
A window.

1011
01:27:31,712 --> 01:27:34,282
I love a window.

1012
01:27:36,483 --> 01:27:40,355
A bird whizzing by.

1013
01:27:42,055 --> 01:27:44,259
Bumblebee.

1014
01:27:48,796 --> 01:27:51,266
It's always different.

1015
01:27:57,070 --> 01:27:59,673
The whole of life.

1016
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:06,547
The whole of life
already framed.

1017
01:28:11,518 --> 01:28:13,554
Right there.

1018
01:28:39,912 --> 01:28:41,581
Something up, pal?

1019
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:44,952
Well, she left me.

1020
01:28:44,984 --> 01:28:48,588
About time, eh?

1021
01:30:20,213 --> 01:30:22,449
<i>You'd never last here.</i>

1022
01:30:23,917 --> 01:30:27,688
It's a seven-mile walk
to the store.

1023
01:30:32,091 --> 01:30:33,894
I mean...

1024
01:30:35,929 --> 01:30:39,033
Harder to look after
than a dog.

1025
01:30:43,970 --> 01:30:46,206
I'm better--

1026
01:30:46,239 --> 01:30:48,809
I'm better than a dog.

1027
01:30:48,841 --> 01:30:52,579
What?

1028
01:30:48,841 --> 01:30:52,579
I'm better than a dog.

1029
01:31:10,796 --> 01:31:12,599
Hey.

1030
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:16,103
Hey, see that cloud?

1031
01:31:16,136 --> 01:31:18,506
That one.

1032
01:31:20,873 --> 01:31:24,144
It kind of looks like a woman
with a big arse.

1033
01:31:26,712 --> 01:31:29,115
Bald on one side
of the head.

1034
01:31:29,149 --> 01:31:30,885
See?

1035
01:31:32,118 --> 01:31:34,721
You see her?
She's looking right at you.

1036
01:31:34,755 --> 01:31:37,625
I don't see her. Mm-mm.

1037
01:31:39,326 --> 01:31:42,262
You don't see her?

1038
01:31:42,296 --> 01:31:44,699
I see you.

1039
01:31:46,033 --> 01:31:48,836
What do you see?

1040
01:31:50,037 --> 01:31:53,541
I see you as my wife.

1041
01:31:55,175 --> 01:31:57,778
I always have.

1042
01:31:59,947 --> 01:32:01,782
I just...

1043
01:32:07,354 --> 01:32:09,923
I don't want you
to leave me.

1044
01:32:12,725 --> 01:32:15,061
Why would I do that?

1045
01:32:19,733 --> 01:32:21,936
Because you can do
much better than me.

1046
01:32:26,038 --> 01:32:27,875
No.

1047
01:32:30,377 --> 01:32:32,713
I couldn't.

1048
01:32:32,746 --> 01:32:34,981
I got everything I want
with you, Ev.

1049
01:32:39,386 --> 01:32:41,689
Everything.

1050
01:33:44,951 --> 01:33:47,755
What are we
doing here, Ev?

1051
01:33:53,426 --> 01:33:55,996
Why are we stopped here?

1052
01:34:00,867 --> 01:34:02,269
That's her house.

1053
01:34:02,301 --> 01:34:04,639
The white one.

1054
01:34:08,274 --> 01:34:09,742
Whose house?

1055
01:34:09,775 --> 01:34:11,979
Her.

1056
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:15,982
Your girl.

1057
01:34:23,390 --> 01:34:25,259
My baby lives here?

1058
01:34:27,359 --> 01:34:29,262
A woman now.

1059
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:33,668
How'd you find her?

1060
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:41,975
She lives here?

1061
01:35:07,067 --> 01:35:09,703
Looks great.

1062
01:35:28,521 --> 01:35:30,524
I'm gonna go wash up for dinner.

1063
01:35:30,556 --> 01:35:33,327
Okay. I'll be in shortly.

1064
01:36:34,921 --> 01:36:37,391
She's so beautiful.

1065
01:36:49,301 --> 01:36:51,304
She's perfect.

1066
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:30,243
One...

1067
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:38,618
You got a big bunch
of mail there.

1068
01:37:38,652 --> 01:37:41,422
Oh, same as yesterday?

1069
01:37:50,997 --> 01:37:54,034
I can't go
any further, Ev.

1070
01:37:57,970 --> 01:38:00,940
Can't go any further.

1071
01:38:04,978 --> 01:38:07,882
Here. Here.

1072
01:38:11,650 --> 01:38:16,155
I don't know what's wrong
with my legs today.

1073
01:38:25,064 --> 01:38:27,134
It's cold, huh?

1074
01:38:25,064 --> 01:38:27,134
Yeah.

1075
01:38:27,167 --> 01:38:30,337
Guess I won't be skiing
this winter.

1076
01:39:25,591 --> 01:39:27,460
Everett.

1077
01:39:27,493 --> 01:39:29,228
Ev.

1078
01:39:31,564 --> 01:39:34,368
Okay, breathe.

1079
01:39:38,505 --> 01:39:40,173
Breathe.

1080
01:39:47,247 --> 01:39:50,217
You haven't given up smoking,
have you?

1081
01:39:52,217 --> 01:39:55,255
Give it up sometimes.

1082
01:39:57,356 --> 01:40:00,226
You have emphysema, Maud.
You can't smoke.

1083
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:02,762
Won't be smoking anymore.

1084
01:40:02,796 --> 01:40:05,432
I'll tell you that.

1085
01:40:02,796 --> 01:40:05,432
Yeah.

1086
01:40:05,465 --> 01:40:08,135
I have arthritis.
It hurts.

1087
01:40:08,167 --> 01:40:10,469
Yeah.

1088
01:40:10,502 --> 01:40:16,509
It's hard to hold
a brush now.

1089
01:40:16,542 --> 01:40:21,047
Can you get me anything
for my arthritis, please?

1090
01:40:21,081 --> 01:40:22,716
I'll get you something.

1091
01:40:22,748 --> 01:40:24,518
Thank you.

1092
01:40:29,421 --> 01:40:30,756
And, uh...

1093
01:40:30,789 --> 01:40:33,092
air the place out a bit,
Everett.

1094
01:40:33,126 --> 01:40:35,162
Air's too thick.

1095
01:40:43,837 --> 01:40:45,806
Is he gone?

1096
01:40:45,838 --> 01:40:47,740
Yeah.

1097
01:40:47,774 --> 01:40:49,576
He's gone.

1098
01:40:55,648 --> 01:40:57,451
Silly.

1099
01:41:05,757 --> 01:41:08,627
There you are.

1100
01:41:08,661 --> 01:41:09,863
Tea.

1101
01:41:09,895 --> 01:41:11,597
Yeah. Thank you.

1102
01:41:11,631 --> 01:41:12,766
There you go.

1103
01:41:12,798 --> 01:41:14,701
I got it.

1104
01:41:28,180 --> 01:41:32,218
You should have kept
more dogs.

1105
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:44,564
Don't want any dog.

1106
01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:49,235
You like dogs.

1107
01:41:53,706 --> 01:41:55,775
But I got you.

1108
01:41:55,807 --> 01:41:58,112
You know...

1109
01:41:59,244 --> 01:42:02,115
should get me
some more dogs.

1110
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:09,555
Hey.

1111
01:42:11,256 --> 01:42:13,425
Are you drinking
all my tea?

1112
01:42:18,398 --> 01:42:19,699
There you go.

1113
01:42:19,731 --> 01:42:22,168
Share it.

1114
01:42:54,634 --> 01:42:56,435
Yeah.

1115
01:43:14,988 --> 01:43:17,191
Maud?

1116
01:43:18,757 --> 01:43:19,960
Maudie?

1117
01:43:19,993 --> 01:43:21,962
Whoa, now.

1118
01:43:21,994 --> 01:43:25,631
What is it?
What is it?

1119
01:43:30,270 --> 01:43:32,305
Can you get in there? Yeah.

1120
01:43:30,270 --> 01:43:32,305
Yeah.

1121
01:43:32,337 --> 01:43:33,672
All right.

1122
01:43:33,706 --> 01:43:35,409
There you go.

1123
01:43:36,876 --> 01:43:39,279
Everett. Everett.

1124
01:43:39,311 --> 01:43:41,648
Everett.

1125
01:43:49,288 --> 01:43:53,393
She's going to be all right.
We'll look after her now.

1126
01:43:53,426 --> 01:43:55,562
No!

1127
01:43:53,426 --> 01:43:55,562
You're gonna be fine.

1128
01:44:17,783 --> 01:44:20,753
I knew you were
getting sicker.

1129
01:44:22,788 --> 01:44:25,692
But every time I'd ask,
you'd lie to me.

1130
01:44:46,679 --> 01:44:48,347
Wonder...

1131
01:44:49,481 --> 01:44:51,717
how I ever thought
you weren't perfect.

1132
01:44:53,019 --> 01:44:54,688
Shh.

1133
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:56,321
Come here.

1134
01:45:00,393 --> 01:45:02,529
Come here.

1135
01:45:06,099 --> 01:45:08,735
I was loved.

1136
01:45:10,103 --> 01:45:12,873
I was loved, Ev.

1137
01:49:47,113 --> 01:49:50,083
<i>The whole of life...</i>

1138
01:49:50,115 --> 01:49:53,086
<i> already framed.</i>

1139
01:49:53,118 --> 01:49:54,954
<i> Right there.</i>

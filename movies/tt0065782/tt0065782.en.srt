1
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:26,294
The relatives...

2
00:02:27,804 --> 00:02:31,454
Those interested in
the ones that disappeared...

3
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:34,792
in the 42 to 44 Russian front...

4
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:43,814
go to the right
in group 14.

5
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,682
To the right.

6
00:02:47,926 --> 00:02:51,054
Again, in group 14.

7
00:02:57,478 --> 00:03:00,606
Madam, if no communication
has come from the army...

8
00:03:00,607 --> 00:03:04,778
or the Ministry, means that your
husband dead hasn't been accepted.

9
00:03:04,779 --> 00:03:06,343
So, he's alive

10
00:03:07,857 --> 00:03:08,900
Alive?

11
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:12,863
Indeed he could be alive.
We believe he's missing.

12
00:03:12,864 --> 00:03:15,992
But, what does missing means?

13
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:17,870
Can you explain it to me?

14
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:21,208
I've already told you, he could
be alive, but we don't know it.

15
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:23,086
Neither do I or his mother!

16
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:25,485
Not her and not me,
how is this possible?

17
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,614
Madam, officially he's not dead
I already told you.

18
00:03:29,103 --> 00:03:32,231
Then he's alive and I want
to know it and you have to tell me!

19
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:36,194
You have to tell me, is he alive
or not? Is he alive?

20
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:38,801
Sure, you have to tell me.
Is he alive?

21
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:07,171
I'll bring him to you madam. I don't
want to see you in that black dress.

22
00:04:07,488 --> 00:04:11,137
I'll bring your son, bring him home,
I'm sure.

23
00:04:11,138 --> 00:04:14,266
Even if I have to travel
all over Russia.

24
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,206
Anto...

25
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:35,938
Anto, are you all right?

26
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:38,542
The rings!

27
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:41,415
Have you swallowed a ring?

28
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,398
Now what can I do?
They're made out of gold.

29
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,441
What can I do to swallow it.

30
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:49,131
Drink!

31
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:56,318
- Where can I find water?
- There, come with me.

32
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:29,058
It's salty.

33
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:30,727
The sea is salty.

34
00:06:30,728 --> 00:06:34,378
Well, feel better hope
I digest it... after...

35
00:06:34,993 --> 00:06:36,036
How sweet!

36
00:06:57,853 --> 00:07:00,460
What are talking, I don't
understand you. Translate.

37
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,712
Where are you from?

38
00:07:02,008 --> 00:07:04,615
From northern Italy,
600 km from here.

39
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,301
But where precisely?

40
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,596
From Losguardo a small village
in the country.

41
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:12,517
Ah! Then you have a country house,
you're a farmer.

42
00:07:12,518 --> 00:07:14,186
Tell me the truth are you a farmer?

43
00:07:14,187 --> 00:07:16,273
Not a farmer, I'm an electrician.

44
00:07:16,274 --> 00:07:19,402
If it wasn't for the war
I would have my electrician degree.

45
00:07:19,403 --> 00:07:22,531
Come on, does my hands look as farmer
hands? See how soft they are.

46
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:24,617
Then, there is nothing wrong
with being a farmer.

47
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:25,661
Was your father a farmer?

48
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:27,956
No, he was a barber,
quite different!

49
00:07:29,225 --> 00:07:30,268
Just imagine!

50
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:33,319
While my father was alive,
it wasn't bad...

51
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,675
I had a good life.

52
00:07:35,198 --> 00:07:37,075
Then I went to live with
my sister...

53
00:07:37,076 --> 00:07:38,640
she was married to a good person

54
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:40,205
I don't complain about work...

55
00:07:40,206 --> 00:07:41,770
I'm good at the kitchen.

56
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:42,814
Very well!

57
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,271
The sand burns...

58
00:07:49,272 --> 00:07:50,836
How much will burn in Africa?

59
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,937
When does your regiment leaves?

60
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:58,509
The day after tomorrow, but
don't make me think as...

61
00:08:22,993 --> 00:08:24,662
And you're going to Africa
just because?

62
00:08:24,663 --> 00:08:26,331
Aren't you going to do something
to stay?

63
00:08:26,332 --> 00:08:27,375
What can I do?

64
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:29,810
There must be a way.

65
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:36,181
Me, I been thinking all day...

66
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,163
Yes? So what can we do?

67
00:08:43,702 --> 00:08:45,266
Don't laugh if I tell you.

68
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:46,309
Won't laugh, tell me.

69
00:08:47,654 --> 00:08:48,696
Let's get married.

70
00:08:51,766 --> 00:08:54,894
Well, with me or any other.
Whoever pleases you.

71
00:08:55,955 --> 00:08:58,561
You'll get 12 days wedding license.

72
00:08:58,562 --> 00:09:01,273
Twelve days will go by and perhaps
then the war is over, who knows?

73
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,090
Or perhaps you won't be sent elsewhere
and you'll be able to remain in Italy.

74
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:06,176
Summarizing, I'm telling you
for your own good.

75
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:08,263
Here in Naples everyone
are doing it.

76
00:09:10,497 --> 00:09:12,791
Listen, we're already married.

77
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:13,835
When

78
00:09:13,836 --> 00:09:15,713
Eh... half an hour ago, here.

79
00:09:15,714 --> 00:09:16,757
Don't joke with this.

80
00:09:20,574 --> 00:09:24,223
See, I'm 32-years-old and
unmarried, I will never marry.

81
00:09:24,701 --> 00:09:27,353
I can see that you haven't found
someone that you like.

82
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,944
Have found more than twenty.

83
00:09:30,551 --> 00:09:32,636
Mean, ugly, blond, redhead...

84
00:09:32,637 --> 00:09:33,680
rich, poor...

85
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,867
but when I smell church, I run.

86
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:39,475
Just imagine! Me marrying
a Neapolitan!

87
00:09:39,924 --> 00:09:43,126
Then go to Africa, to war, to heat
and to scorpions...

88
00:09:43,127 --> 00:09:45,212
tell the angels to care for you
and goodbye.

89
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,269
You know what? Better scorpions
than marriage!

90
00:09:50,063 --> 00:09:51,627
And who's getting married?

91
00:10:17,285 --> 00:10:20,413
What a head! I forgot to give you
the present!

92
00:10:21,584 --> 00:10:23,461
- They are for me?
- Yes.

93
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:25,136
Madonna, they're beautiful!

94
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,922
Do you like them?
I love them!

95
00:10:32,512 --> 00:10:33,555
Thanks.

96
00:10:36,943 --> 00:10:40,280
But your mother should have come to
the wedding. No one does that.

97
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:43,578
It hurts me more for you
than for me.

98
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:46,707
Don't worry.
My mother is old, stubborn.

99
00:10:47,853 --> 00:10:51,559
Imagine that she thinks that
I'll marry for money.

100
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,730
Money? What money? I have nothing,
but you went crazy for me.

101
00:10:56,042 --> 00:11:00,734
Be patient. When we have a child
she'll love the kid and you.

102
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:06,135
I don't want only one child,
I want a large family.

103
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,192
And this? Too much water, Holy Mother!

104
00:11:17,172 --> 00:11:18,215
Don't be mean!

105
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:20,347
What are you doing?

106
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:46,850
Anto!

107
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,106
What are those bells?

108
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:52,547
Anto!

109
00:11:58,156 --> 00:11:59,199
Anto!

110
00:12:00,465 --> 00:12:02,342
What are those bells?

111
00:12:02,862 --> 00:12:03,905
What time it is?

112
00:12:05,331 --> 00:12:06,374
Seven.

113
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,190
Seven in the morning or afternoon?

114
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:10,443
Who knows...

115
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:21,438
It's "rinning"...

116
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:22,668
Translate!

117
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:25,294
It's raining.

118
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:28,136
Can't deduce if its morning
or afternoon.

119
00:12:28,321 --> 00:12:31,373
There are people going to Church.
Is it Sunday?

120
00:12:31,374 --> 00:12:32,417
Surely.

121
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,503
But, what do we care?

122
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:38,154
How come we don't care?
We arrived on Thursday.

123
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:43,326
Let me see... Sunday was yesterday!
Then today must be Monday.

124
00:12:45,528 --> 00:12:48,864
Monday... then we have only 8 days!

125
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:03,350
It's a wedding, the husband is a soldier.

126
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:07,954
Holy Mother, I forgot
is Alfredo that works with me.

127
00:13:08,394 --> 00:13:12,565
He invited me to the wedding.
Where is my head!

128
00:13:13,071 --> 00:13:16,199
But this Alfredo also married for a license?

129
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,397
I don't know. Could be.
Tell me the truth!

130
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:22,021
Isn't because you married me
only for the license?

131
00:13:22,394 --> 00:13:25,000
Don't be stupid, I married you
because I love you.

132
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:27,712
But you were not sure,
you were afraid.

133
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:31,059
You said that marriage
gave you the chills.

134
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,041
- Yes.
- And now, are you still scared?

135
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:46,869
Giovanna, we need to cover the
windows, otherwise we'll get a fine.

136
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,956
They say that the alarm has been given.

137
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,291
Still 6? Ah! it stopped.
It's night must be one o'clock.

138
00:14:00,197 --> 00:14:01,240
I don't want anything illegal!

139
00:14:04,913 --> 00:14:07,311
Are you hungry?
I'll prepare some pasta.

140
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,919
No, you don't move from here.
Today I'm cooking.

141
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,006
- What? You know how to cook?
- Haven't told you?

142
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:14,613
I'm a magician in the kitchen!
Come on!

143
00:14:52,528 --> 00:14:54,092
What are you doing?

144
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:55,136
A Frittata.

145
00:14:55,253 --> 00:14:57,860
- How many eggs?
- 24.

146
00:14:59,682 --> 00:15:03,332
- And who eats 24 eggs?
- My grandmother, my grandmother...

147
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:07,295
I've eaten with my grandmother
the morning after the milling.

148
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:08,860
Understood?
Lard.

149
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,501
Lard? In these times,
where do you find lard?

150
00:15:13,503 --> 00:15:17,256
- Besides Frittata is done with oil.
- My mother does it with lard.

151
00:15:17,257 --> 00:15:19,447
Your mother is wrong
as is done with oil.

152
00:15:19,448 --> 00:15:22,368
By the way, she's sick
with bronchitis

153
00:15:23,368 --> 00:15:26,287
The bronchitis she catch it on purpose
to not meet us.

154
00:15:26,288 --> 00:15:27,539
Don't say that.
Salt.

155
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,533
This is an ugly salt.

156
00:15:38,057 --> 00:15:39,100
Pepper.

157
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,082
Scientific.

158
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,419
Tools.

159
00:15:59,582 --> 00:16:02,189
The military service has spoiled me.
Lost my practice.

160
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,695
Looks like gold,
pure gold!

161
00:16:09,687 --> 00:16:12,606
My father soul was what
took care of us all.

162
00:16:13,783 --> 00:16:14,825
He was a champ!

163
00:16:19,183 --> 00:16:20,747
A true deli that you have to taste.

164
00:16:40,996 --> 00:16:42,873
- It's ready.
- Me too.

165
00:16:50,748 --> 00:16:51,790
The glasses.

166
00:17:11,148 --> 00:17:12,712
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

167
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:26,836
Smells good.

168
00:17:27,987 --> 00:17:29,030
To us!

169
00:17:30,006 --> 00:17:31,048
Then dessert.

170
00:17:32,282 --> 00:17:33,324
What?

171
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,181
No "mo", no "mo".

172
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:39,234
Translate!

173
00:17:39,235 --> 00:17:42,363
- Can't talk!
- It's okay...

174
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:45,371
because I love you much.

175
00:17:58,489 --> 00:17:59,532
What a heat! It's suffocating.

176
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:04,176
I can't breath.

177
00:18:04,177 --> 00:18:05,220
You're revolting... eh!

178
00:18:13,295 --> 00:18:15,380
But how my grandfather did it?

179
00:18:15,381 --> 00:18:17,258
I don't want to see an egg
for a month.

180
00:18:18,177 --> 00:18:19,219
Me for a year.

181
00:18:20,952 --> 00:18:23,038
Luckily, I did add onion.

182
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:29,680
- I'll throw this away.
- Yes, take it out of my sight.

183
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:38,541
- And this, where did it come from?
- Perhaps my mother sent it.

184
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:40,627
She knocked the door
and we didn't notice.

185
00:18:40,628 --> 00:18:41,671
What are you doing?

186
00:18:43,244 --> 00:18:46,894
You're not leaving them outside,
they're my mother's eggs.

187
00:18:57,413 --> 00:18:59,727
I don't want to look at them,
at least for 10 years.

188
00:19:03,215 --> 00:19:05,822
And now? Shall we go out?

189
00:19:07,715 --> 00:19:10,843
- And were to?
- Let's go to take some fresh air.

190
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:22,234
Oh! Sunrise.
At this hour my father was on the fields.

191
00:19:23,397 --> 00:19:28,089
- You have no strength in your legs.
- What are you saying! I'm stronger than you.

192
00:19:40,553 --> 00:19:44,202
I never thought you were that strong.

193
00:19:53,962 --> 00:19:56,152
What are you laughing for?
The eggs.

194
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,238
No, I beg you, my stomach
is about to explode.

195
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:02,410
- I close the eyes and see so many eggs.
- Don't close them then.

196
00:20:02,706 --> 00:20:04,791
But even if I open my eyes
I see them.

197
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:13,732
Flares!
Be careful!

198
00:20:57,169 --> 00:20:59,254
Stay calm. It's over.

199
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:05,557
I wasn't afraid.
You made me understand...

200
00:21:06,905 --> 00:21:07,947
so many things, Anto.

201
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:11,960
I want to be with you forever.

202
00:21:11,961 --> 00:21:14,046
Even if it was in the mountains.

203
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:21,346
How many days have gone by, Anto?

204
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:23,558
Eight.

205
00:21:23,753 --> 00:21:25,004
No, ten.

206
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,269
Two days!
Only two days.

207
00:21:32,094 --> 00:21:33,137
Help me!

208
00:21:33,138 --> 00:21:34,181
I'll kill you.

209
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,341
Help me!
Stay still, stay still.

210
00:21:52,636 --> 00:21:53,678
Poor woman.

211
00:21:56,926 --> 00:21:58,803
I'll kill everyone!

212
00:22:00,023 --> 00:22:02,004
Anto! What are you doing?

213
00:22:22,636 --> 00:22:23,679
What happened?

214
00:22:23,698 --> 00:22:26,391
Nothing, nothing.
How come nothing?

215
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,028
Nothing... nothing.
Don't know what overcome him.

216
00:22:31,777 --> 00:22:33,341
He was calm and then...

217
00:22:34,332 --> 00:22:36,939
he gets white,
the eyes full of fury...

218
00:22:37,784 --> 00:22:40,912
then comes and puts both hands
in the neck, like this...

219
00:22:41,283 --> 00:22:44,411
Had a really bad time!
When coming, he fell to the floor...

220
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,553
as people says,
I pour him cold water.

221
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:52,893
He locked himself in the kitchen
and didn't want to come out.

222
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:56,123
He was yelling,
Dammed the day I married.

223
00:22:58,187 --> 00:23:01,315
What a misfortune. Maybe is over.

224
00:23:18,826 --> 00:23:20,911
Sergeant, here he is!

225
00:23:34,302 --> 00:23:35,344
Antonio

226
00:23:39,287 --> 00:23:40,330
Wait!

227
00:23:43,447 --> 00:23:45,324
Wait a moment!

228
00:23:46,587 --> 00:23:49,715
I'll make him to come out.
Wait a moment!

229
00:23:57,676 --> 00:24:00,804
No, no I'll make him to come out,
they won't do any to you, I swear...

230
00:24:05,008 --> 00:24:06,885
Don't harm him!

231
00:24:09,752 --> 00:24:13,401
Antonio, come out,
they won't harm you I swear...

232
00:24:19,696 --> 00:24:21,782
Do you her me, Antonio...

233
00:24:28,006 --> 00:24:29,048
Anto.

234
00:24:36,302 --> 00:24:37,345
Release me!

235
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:39,802
Don't harm him!

236
00:26:03,548 --> 00:26:07,719
I want the Director.
I want to know why I'm inside here.

237
00:26:09,172 --> 00:26:14,386
I'm Saint Joseph.
Yes, he's Saint Joseph, I guarantee it!

238
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,764
Come, madam.

239
00:27:38,304 --> 00:27:40,911
You, you're as crazy as me.
Doctor!

240
00:27:40,912 --> 00:27:46,125
You're lucid and can chose between
a process or voluntary leave to Russia.

241
00:28:28,835 --> 00:28:33,006
Stop! The first squad
gets into the train to the right...

242
00:28:33,007 --> 00:28:36,135
The second squad into the
train to the left...

243
00:28:37,797 --> 00:28:40,925
You have 15 minutes.
Dismiss!

244
00:28:43,808 --> 00:28:46,936
Giovanna we have 15 mins.
Come, come.

245
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,409
- Giovanna!
- Yes?

246
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:13,771
- I'll come back from Russia soon, you'll see.
- Yes.

247
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:16,900
- I'll bring you a fur.
- Yes.

248
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:45,394
The war is over!

249
00:30:51,334 --> 00:30:56,339
Hey! come here. What are you saying?
What is over? -The war.

250
00:31:49,238 --> 00:31:51,323
Do you know him?
Do you know him?

251
00:32:17,318 --> 00:32:18,361
Maria! Maria!

252
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,245
Do you know him?

253
00:32:38,018 --> 00:32:41,146
But this is Antonio.
Is he alive?

254
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:46,296
- We were together.
- Is he alive?

255
00:32:46,483 --> 00:32:49,969
- Possibly, I don't know.
- How do you know?

256
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:04,057
Stop!

257
00:33:04,955 --> 00:33:09,126
I've been waiting
for this moment many years...

258
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,595
I have to find someone
who tells me about him...

259
00:33:12,596 --> 00:33:14,682
who has seen him,
who met him

260
00:33:14,683 --> 00:33:18,854
Let's sit down,
come here.

261
00:33:18,974 --> 00:33:20,016
Is he alive?

262
00:33:20,863 --> 00:33:26,076
Tell me, where have you seen him?
Where did you left him the last time?

263
00:33:26,685 --> 00:33:28,562
Where is he?

264
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:32,419
- We were together...
- Where?

265
00:33:33,741 --> 00:33:35,827
There, in the mountains.

266
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:39,647
It was January, an awful month.

267
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,853
The Russians had positioned and we
had to take them out no matter what...

268
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:54,233
You can't imagine, madam, what
snow is if you haven't been to Russia

269
00:33:56,391 --> 00:33:59,519
You stay still for 3 mins
and you freeze...

270
00:33:59,781 --> 00:34:03,952
Meanwhile, the Russians came
from everywhere. It was hell.

271
00:34:04,104 --> 00:34:06,815
We have been inside hell.

272
00:34:06,816 --> 00:34:12,030
The snow, the ice, the wind that cut
your face, thirst, hunger.

273
00:34:12,446 --> 00:34:15,680
Always sleepless, night and day...
A true hell.

274
00:37:09,096 --> 00:37:11,390
I don't feel my hands. Damn it.

275
00:37:28,806 --> 00:37:31,935
Here everything is burned.
Where are we going?

276
00:37:32,437 --> 00:37:33,480
Look!

277
00:38:32,391 --> 00:38:33,434
Close that door!

278
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:42,074
- I can't stand it more!
- Come on, stand up!

279
00:38:47,068 --> 00:38:50,196
Then, when we escaped
from the ravine

280
00:38:51,626 --> 00:38:54,754
we walked many kilometers
in the snow.

281
00:39:54,137 --> 00:39:56,222
Anto! Come on stand up!

282
00:39:59,067 --> 00:40:00,110
Have strength!

283
00:40:13,173 --> 00:40:14,215
Walk!

284
00:40:23,049 --> 00:40:26,177
Anto, you should walk!
Otherwise you'll freeze.

285
00:41:34,324 --> 00:41:38,494
When I turned around, he signaled me
to go on, to not think about him.

286
00:41:39,451 --> 00:41:42,579
- That's the last time I saw him.
- You never saw him again?

287
00:41:44,356 --> 00:41:48,527
And you left him there in the snow,
without giving him a hand, in the cold...

288
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:55,040
- What can I do?
- Wasn't anybody there to help you?

289
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:56,084
What kind of people are they?

290
00:41:57,942 --> 00:41:58,984
I don't know.

291
00:41:59,763 --> 00:42:02,787
Perhaps someone could help you.

292
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,793
Listen...

293
00:43:08,223 --> 00:43:11,352
Come inside, I'll prepare coffee.

294
00:43:14,202 --> 00:43:17,330
No, coffee makes me sick,
can't drink it.

295
00:43:25,961 --> 00:43:28,046
I'm happy to see you.

296
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:39,109
- Want some water?
- No, thanks, no.

297
00:43:46,723 --> 00:43:49,851
- Some cakes?
- No, please, no.

298
00:43:51,498 --> 00:43:52,541
Sit down.

299
00:43:56,741 --> 00:43:59,869
He's alive, I can feel it,
he's not dead.

300
00:44:01,545 --> 00:44:06,759
- But if he's alive, why hasn't he written?
- To you or me?

301
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:12,647
Why he hasn't come back,
as many others?

302
00:44:14,523 --> 00:44:16,608
I will go, I go.

303
00:44:17,717 --> 00:44:19,802
Now they say that things have changed.

304
00:44:19,803 --> 00:44:21,846
That now isn't impossible.

305
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,601
They say you can go there.
I'll try.

306
00:44:25,014 --> 00:44:27,099
Even if it was impossible
I will try the same.

307
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,811
- To Russia?
- Yes, to Russia.

308
00:44:31,438 --> 00:44:34,045
So many have tried
and didn't make it...

309
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:43,770
This... is the last photo he sent me.

310
00:44:48,742 --> 00:44:49,993
Look, madam...

311
00:44:50,826 --> 00:44:53,537
He probably had warm with
that many clothes...

312
00:44:54,938 --> 00:44:55,981
What are you saying...

313
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:01,219
If a soldier does not
cover like this he dies...

314
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,763
He's alive.

315
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:29,937
- Spaziva, that's how you say it?
- Yes, Spaziva.

316
00:49:31,091 --> 00:49:36,305
Here some Italian soldiers and
Russian civilians,

317
00:49:36,377 --> 00:49:40,505
the Germans make them
dig their own graves.

318
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:42,883
See madam...

319
00:49:43,966 --> 00:49:50,222
each sunflower, each tree, each
grain field hides the bodies...

320
00:49:50,896 --> 00:49:57,153
of Italian soldiers, Russians, Germans
and also the bodies of many...

321
00:49:57,154 --> 00:50:02,367
Russian peasants, old, women, children.

322
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,691
I'm sure that my husband is not there.
Antonio is alive.

323
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:40,993
You have to find peace for your heart, madam.
There are no Italians alive in Russia.

324
00:51:41,609 --> 00:51:42,860
It cannot be!

325
00:51:44,138 --> 00:51:49,352
Alive Italians for sure.
Wounded, some that lost their memory.

326
00:51:49,353 --> 00:51:51,438
Why not? It happens, no?

327
00:51:53,702 --> 00:51:57,039
Me, I know one that came to Moscow
to a soccer game

328
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,585
have seen one of those Italians.
I have spoken to them.

329
00:52:00,586 --> 00:52:01,629
And what did he say?

330
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:03,507
No idea what he said.

331
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,897
I know, it is true.

332
00:52:11,564 --> 00:52:13,207
Holy Mother...

333
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:15,502
This gravestone recalls his fellowmen.

334
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:19,235
Belongs to a Russian poet.

335
00:52:20,994 --> 00:52:26,208
Young man from Naples, what
brings you to this Russian field?

336
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:29,438
Weren't you happy in your
motherland?

337
00:52:29,439 --> 00:52:32,254
Me, that I found you
jailed in Moscow...

338
00:52:32,255 --> 00:52:34,132
so far away from your land...

339
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:15,787
Are you Italian?

340
00:55:18,582 --> 00:55:22,189
Italian? No.

341
00:56:12,849 --> 00:56:13,891
You are Italian.

342
00:56:15,516 --> 00:56:16,559
Anyone can tell because your
hair, your eyes, everything.

343
00:56:19,652 --> 00:56:24,344
But how can you be ashamed of
being Italian? Why you're ashamed?

344
00:56:32,244 --> 00:56:33,287
It is true?

345
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:37,477
I came here searching for my husband.

346
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:40,607
But I can't find if he's alive or dead.

347
00:57:00,718 --> 00:57:01,761
You're Italian.

348
00:57:02,574 --> 00:57:03,930
Where are you from?

349
00:57:05,284 --> 00:57:07,891
I was Italian, now I'm Russian.

350
00:57:08,912 --> 00:57:10,580
Why?

351
00:57:10,663 --> 00:57:12,018
Because... because...

352
00:57:14,236 --> 00:57:17,990
It's a long story...
the because certain things...

353
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,564
happen and that's enough.

354
00:57:39,037 --> 00:57:42,165
No, I don't know him.
I was an alpine man...

355
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:45,294
If I find something
I swear I'll tell you

356
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:49,466
Why don't you go home?
Which home?

357
00:58:19,453 --> 00:58:20,496
No.

358
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,540
Do you know him?

359
00:58:29,661 --> 00:58:30,704
Do you know him?

360
00:58:40,939 --> 00:58:41,982
Have you seen him?

361
01:01:17,068 --> 01:01:18,111
Good day!

362
01:03:02,897 --> 01:03:03,939
I know nothing.

363
01:03:07,002 --> 01:03:08,045
It's too hard!

364
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:13,294
I'm very tired!

365
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,566
Antonio was a dead body.

366
01:04:07,327 --> 01:04:08,369
Almost dead

367
01:04:12,731 --> 01:04:13,774
He was...

368
01:04:16,449 --> 01:04:17,492
frozen.

369
01:06:51,442 --> 01:06:52,484
Antonio...

370
01:06:53,995 --> 01:06:58,166
has forgotten everything.
Everything, do you understand?

371
01:07:01,276 --> 01:07:04,404
and I was always near,
always to cure him.

372
01:07:26,571 --> 01:07:27,613
Come.

373
01:10:54,012 --> 01:10:57,140
I don't want to see you anymore!
I don't want to see you anymore!

374
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:34,363
No you wouldn't... no.

375
01:11:49,229 --> 01:11:52,357
That's not the way it's done!
It's not done like this!

376
01:13:08,817 --> 01:13:11,456
Are you afraid?

377
01:13:11,622 --> 01:13:12,664
No, I'm cold.

378
01:13:13,615 --> 01:13:16,743
Let's take a ride by the village,
would you like to?

379
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:21,263
- Since when do you drive a motorcycle?
- Since I was a kid.

380
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,191
- Are we going down?
- No, it is flat.

381
01:13:24,192 --> 01:13:27,321
There is nothing to be afraid,
I'm an ace at driving.

382
01:13:41,107 --> 01:13:43,193
- Shall we go to the river?
- Yes, let's go.

383
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:13,652
Damn!

384
01:14:17,309 --> 01:14:20,959
- Are you crazy?
- The damn brakes didn't work!

385
01:14:21,043 --> 01:14:24,693
But straight into the river.
Who could imagine?

386
01:14:25,605 --> 01:14:28,733
We should be glad that
nothing happened to us.

387
01:14:28,734 --> 01:14:30,298
I knew I shouldn't come.

388
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,698
If you'd have told me that you
never rode a motorcycle...

389
01:14:32,792 --> 01:14:34,878
All right,
but is this the way to do it?

390
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:35,922
There it is!

391
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:41,142
Take.

392
01:14:41,726 --> 01:14:42,873
Where are you going?

393
01:14:42,874 --> 01:14:45,481
- Home. And I walk.
- Wait!

394
01:14:45,482 --> 01:14:47,359
Don't say!

395
01:15:21,181 --> 01:15:22,850
Want to come in?

396
01:15:36,697 --> 01:15:37,740
Want to sit down?

397
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:42,684
Did you pull out Antonio?

398
01:15:45,391 --> 01:15:46,434
Yes.

399
01:15:48,015 --> 01:15:51,352
It's better... it would have been better
if he's dead!

400
01:15:51,652 --> 01:15:55,302
Better for me, better for you,
better for everyone...

401
01:15:59,763 --> 01:16:03,412
Madam, he's alive,
has a house, a woman

402
01:16:05,084 --> 01:16:06,126
and a little girl.

403
01:20:10,542 --> 01:20:11,585
Antonio!

404
01:25:38,714 --> 01:25:41,842
You like to meddle into
gossip...

405
01:25:41,843 --> 01:25:44,971
Do not forget what is
more convenient for you.

406
01:25:59,155 --> 01:26:00,198
Hi!

407
01:26:00,199 --> 01:26:03,327
Hello, Giovanna.
Who's speaking?

408
01:26:03,544 --> 01:26:05,733
Giovanna, it's me, Antonio.

409
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,314
It's Antonio.

410
01:26:10,375 --> 01:26:11,417
Giovanna!

411
01:26:11,547 --> 01:26:12,589
Where are you?

412
01:26:12,755 --> 01:26:14,632
I'm here in Milan.

413
01:26:21,547 --> 01:26:23,424
I came looking for you.

414
01:26:24,465 --> 01:26:27,072
Giovanna, when can I see you?

415
01:26:27,695 --> 01:26:30,301
How did you find me?

416
01:26:30,302 --> 01:26:32,617
Went to the village and they
gave me your phone number.

417
01:26:35,181 --> 01:26:38,320
I don't want to see you.
I don't want to see you.

418
01:26:38,321 --> 01:26:40,928
No. One moment,
just one moment.

419
01:26:42,899 --> 01:26:44,985
I have come from so far away!

420
01:26:45,886 --> 01:26:47,971
Me too, I have traveled so much...

421
01:26:47,972 --> 01:26:50,287
day, night until I find you

422
01:26:50,978 --> 01:26:53,064
don't make me tell you.

423
01:26:53,444 --> 01:26:54,487
Anto...

424
01:26:55,712 --> 01:26:57,693
I'm not either alone.

425
01:27:01,609 --> 01:27:03,485
Are you with someone?

426
01:27:03,695 --> 01:27:04,738
Yes.

427
01:27:04,995 --> 01:27:06,664
He's a factory worker...

428
01:27:06,665 --> 01:27:11,044
Now he's at the factory
has the night shift.

429
01:27:14,110 --> 01:27:18,280
Then we will not met. I'm leaving
like if we have never talked...

430
01:27:18,282 --> 01:27:19,324
is better like this.

431
01:27:19,922 --> 01:27:24,093
Anyway we have nothing to do
you have another woman...

432
01:27:24,923 --> 01:27:27,239
and with another woman, I don't
want to know anything about you

433
01:27:29,435 --> 01:27:31,521
Then, goodbye Giovanna...

434
01:27:37,248 --> 01:27:38,917
Goodbye Anto... goodbye.

435
01:28:59,372 --> 01:29:00,415
Excuse me...

436
01:29:00,471 --> 01:29:03,599
The strike also applies
to international trains?

437
01:29:03,913 --> 01:29:05,071
Where are you going?

438
01:29:05,478 --> 01:29:06,625
To Vienna.

439
01:29:06,835 --> 01:29:09,441
You have to take it tomorrow
morning at 6.

440
01:29:09,676 --> 01:29:10,927
Is there another way to do it?

441
01:29:11,359 --> 01:29:12,610
What do you mean?

442
01:29:13,458 --> 01:29:15,700
I have seen a bus service.

443
01:29:15,990 --> 01:29:20,251
Yes, but they go to
Torino, Verona, Novara, Bologna.

444
01:29:20,252 --> 01:29:22,338
They won't take you there.

445
01:30:28,657 --> 01:30:30,972
Everything is a mess with this strike.

446
01:30:31,716 --> 01:30:36,200
There is a bus service that substitutes
the train. It's about to leave.

447
01:30:36,409 --> 01:30:38,286
But where do I have to go?

448
01:30:38,287 --> 01:30:39,330
Sorry, I believed...

449
01:30:40,652 --> 01:30:42,738
Saw you buying a present and...

450
01:30:42,762 --> 01:30:45,890
Ah! the doll, no, is for me.
I like them.

451
01:30:47,927 --> 01:30:49,387
Don't you like them?

452
01:30:54,358 --> 01:30:57,799
Listen, can you tell me
about a nearby hotel?

453
01:30:59,276 --> 01:31:02,361
Could be The Galia, but...

454
01:31:02,978 --> 01:31:05,063
No, a cheap hotel.

455
01:31:05,064 --> 01:31:06,107
No.

456
01:31:09,345 --> 01:31:11,744
Want to sleep with me?

457
01:31:28,043 --> 01:31:29,086
Where?

458
01:31:29,386 --> 01:31:30,610
There, nearby.

459
01:31:36,081 --> 01:31:37,645
Where are you from?

460
01:31:40,454 --> 01:31:41,496
And where are you?

461
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:45,385
Do you have a phone?

462
01:31:45,951 --> 01:31:47,932
Yes, here near the door.

463
01:32:11,545 --> 01:32:14,631
- Antonio!
- Yes, listen...

464
01:32:15,506 --> 01:32:18,426
Missed my train, can't leave
until tomorrow...

465
01:32:20,595 --> 01:32:25,087
I want to see you.
I have to talk to you.

466
01:32:25,088 --> 01:32:27,607
Tell me where you are.

467
01:32:29,007 --> 01:32:30,884
Ambrosio Giovagnoli Plaza 42.

468
01:32:33,838 --> 01:32:36,132
Wait, I have to write down
the address.

469
01:32:36,747 --> 01:32:39,354
Excuse me, do you have
a pencil? I have to write...

470
01:32:39,836 --> 01:32:41,391
Only an eyeliner.

471
01:32:43,114 --> 01:32:44,857
Repeat the address.

472
01:32:47,125 --> 01:32:53,277
Ambrosio Giovagnoli Plaza 42,
third floor apartment 8.

473
01:32:54,523 --> 01:32:55,566
Thanks.

474
01:33:00,014 --> 01:33:02,100
Listen, how to I call a taxi?

475
01:33:02,462 --> 01:33:03,817
A taxi?

476
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:07,037
Why?
Are you leaving?

477
01:33:07,745 --> 01:33:08,788
Yes.

478
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:14,982
But I got naked and
the mirror is dirty.

479
01:33:17,144 --> 01:33:18,187
How much you charge?

480
01:35:51,908 --> 01:35:56,600
It's dark, meeting like this in
the dark after so much time.

481
01:36:05,399 --> 01:36:08,318
Please let me in.
I'll leave soon.

482
01:36:08,528 --> 01:36:09,883
Yes, sorry.

483
01:36:16,562 --> 01:36:20,211
I'll look for a candle.
Where did I put it?

484
01:36:20,756 --> 01:36:23,884
You're all wet.
No, it's nothing...

485
01:36:37,126 --> 01:36:39,211
Can't believe you're here.

486
01:36:39,672 --> 01:36:40,715
Listen, Giovanna...

487
01:36:47,121 --> 01:36:49,207
I have to explain everything.

488
01:36:50,204 --> 01:36:54,896
I wanted to kill myself, but I understood
that you can live without love.

489
01:36:57,836 --> 01:36:58,879
It's true...

490
01:37:00,676 --> 01:37:03,553
I don't know if you know
what happened.

491
01:37:05,906 --> 01:37:09,555
I had 1000 km of snow
in front of me.

492
01:37:10,143 --> 01:37:12,750
When I opened my eyes...

493
01:37:14,232 --> 01:37:16,213
I was in a house,

494
01:37:19,211 --> 01:37:20,775
an unknown house,

495
01:37:22,254 --> 01:37:24,548
with a woman I have
never seen before.

496
01:37:27,336 --> 01:37:29,942
And I couldn't remember
a thing...

497
01:37:29,943 --> 01:37:32,654
For a long time I couldn't
remember a thing.

498
01:37:32,655 --> 01:37:34,220
All you're saying
I already know it.

499
01:37:35,139 --> 01:37:39,831
She saved your life. She healed you
and gave you everything you needed.

500
01:37:40,971 --> 01:37:43,265
You should have given her many
thanks and come back here.

501
01:37:45,184 --> 01:37:47,373
Instead you stayed...

502
01:37:49,842 --> 01:37:51,928
and had a child with her.

503
01:37:57,733 --> 01:37:59,714
I felt that it was the only...

504
01:38:01,628 --> 01:38:03,922
safe place available for me.

505
01:38:13,162 --> 01:38:15,247
Do you love her?

506
01:38:16,451 --> 01:38:17,494
For me...

507
01:38:22,203 --> 01:38:23,246
it has been...

508
01:38:26,276 --> 01:38:28,257
as if I was dead...

509
01:38:30,757 --> 01:38:33,048
And afterwards, I was
someone else.

510
01:38:34,816 --> 01:38:37,944
Death so close,
changes people.

511
01:38:38,793 --> 01:38:41,922
Changes the feelings.

512
01:38:43,990 --> 01:38:46,597
I don't know how to explain...

513
01:38:50,292 --> 01:38:52,899
Me, with her...

514
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:56,785
I found some peace.

515
01:39:02,715 --> 01:39:06,886
How can I make you understand.
I came because I believed that...

516
01:39:06,887 --> 01:39:09,494
I could easily explain everything to you.

517
01:39:10,547 --> 01:39:12,632
War is ugly.

518
01:39:14,164 --> 01:39:16,250
It was...

519
01:39:17,557 --> 01:39:21,414
It was like that...
Ugly, Giovanna.

520
01:39:26,351 --> 01:39:28,437
It was difficult...

521
01:39:43,969 --> 01:39:46,680
I don't know why it happened.

522
01:40:31,404 --> 01:40:33,072
I look for a candle.

523
01:40:54,594 --> 01:40:57,722
Don't look at me like that.
I've aged.

524
01:41:07,145 --> 01:41:09,752
You also have become an old man.

525
01:41:09,753 --> 01:41:12,047
Everything is a disaster.

526
01:41:29,457 --> 01:41:31,334
How much white hair!

527
01:41:36,359 --> 01:41:37,402
Antonio!

528
01:41:37,403 --> 01:41:40,218
Come back to me.
I still love you.

529
01:41:40,523 --> 01:41:43,130
And you still love me,
I can feel it.

530
01:41:43,131 --> 01:41:44,173
How could I go back to you?

531
01:41:44,987 --> 01:41:46,029
How could I go back to you?

532
01:42:23,147 --> 01:42:26,796
The baby.
Have you understood, Anto?

533
01:42:32,870 --> 01:42:35,998
But I can't leave you like this.

534
01:42:35,999 --> 01:42:37,355
I'll take you with me.

535
01:42:37,356 --> 01:42:40,484
We will start a new life
in another place.

536
01:42:40,485 --> 01:42:43,613
And where would you take me
with this child?

537
01:42:43,614 --> 01:42:46,325
And you also have a daughter.

538
01:42:46,326 --> 01:42:49,037
We will ruin the kids and you.

539
01:42:59,881 --> 01:43:00,924
My love.

540
01:43:17,481 --> 01:43:20,609
- What's his name?
- Antonio.

541
01:43:22,590 --> 01:43:23,633
Like me.

542
01:43:24,229 --> 01:43:26,835
No, Antonio like Saint Anthony.

543
01:43:42,773 --> 01:43:43,816
I brought you...

544
01:43:50,777 --> 01:43:52,862
I promised you.

2
00:00:13,683 --> 00:00:15,651
Get over here!

3
00:00:40,177 --> 00:00:42,813
Look, what do you see?

4
00:00:43,947 --> 00:00:45,481
Papa, the scorpion,

5
00:00:45,548 --> 00:00:47,550
it needs help.

6
00:00:47,617 --> 00:00:49,853
Life is cruel, Satoshi.

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,388
It doesn't care
where you are from,

8
00:00:52,455 --> 00:00:54,690
what God you pray to.

9
00:00:54,758 --> 00:00:55,625
It is.

10
00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:57,727
So you must face it head on.

11
00:00:58,962 --> 00:01:00,429
See the scorpion?

12
00:01:01,564 --> 00:01:03,432
No matter how many enemies,

13
00:01:03,499 --> 00:01:05,235
it continues on.

14
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:07,436
It is strong, yes.

15
00:01:07,503 --> 00:01:09,405
It is fast.

16
00:01:09,472 --> 00:01:12,308
But do you know why
the scorpion is feared?

17
00:01:14,443 --> 00:01:15,578
Its will.

18
00:01:20,516 --> 00:01:23,754
Willpower is what makes
your destiny your own.

19
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:28,158
Learn to be strong,
here and here.

20
00:01:28,225 --> 00:01:30,761
Promise me you'll remember that?

21
00:01:30,828 --> 00:01:32,328
I will, Papa.

22
00:01:33,197 --> 00:01:35,265
Now, let's get home.

23
00:01:35,331 --> 00:01:36,566
Your mother is making dinner,

24
00:01:36,632 --> 00:01:39,502
and she won't be happy
if we're late.

25
00:01:42,338 --> 00:01:43,740
Hold on.

26
00:01:43,807 --> 00:01:47,343
Faster, Papa, faster!

27
00:01:49,313 --> 00:01:52,481
More!

28
00:01:54,184 --> 00:01:56,320
Your papa needs a break.

29
00:02:24,714 --> 00:02:26,549
Where is everyone, Papa?

30
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:28,417
Hold tight, Satoshi.

31
00:02:46,402 --> 00:02:47,737
Aah!

32
00:04:00,043 --> 00:04:01,144
Harumi.

33
00:04:33,477 --> 00:04:34,745
Harumi!

34
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,181
Harumi!

35
00:04:38,248 --> 00:04:39,615
Mama!

36
00:07:01,525 --> 00:07:02,959
Enough!

37
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:15,805
Come further,
and he dies.

38
00:07:18,608 --> 00:07:20,443
What do you want?

39
00:07:21,545 --> 00:07:22,946
On your knees.

40
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:37,928
Ahh!

41
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:46,536
If you touch a hair
on his head...

42
00:07:46,603 --> 00:07:49,239
Papa!

43
00:07:53,276 --> 00:07:54,811
Papa.

44
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,582
Satoshi!

45
00:07:58,648 --> 00:08:00,217
Satoshi!

46
00:08:08,558 --> 00:08:09,960
Satoshi.

47
00:08:10,627 --> 00:08:12,028
Satoshi!

48
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:14,164
Satoshi!

49
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:19,369
I'll kill you!

50
00:08:19,436 --> 00:08:21,538
I'll kill you!

51
00:08:41,424 --> 00:08:43,860
You'll die for this.

52
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:45,729
You first.

53
00:10:12,783 --> 00:10:14,617
Lord Raiden!

54
00:10:14,684 --> 00:10:17,187
I'm sorry. I... I didn't know.

55
00:10:17,253 --> 00:10:20,423
No, you did well, Lui Kang.

56
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,125
Just as you were taught.

57
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:25,295
And now, I pray it is enough.

58
00:10:27,597 --> 00:10:30,567
Enough? Then it is time.

59
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:32,635
Yes. Do not worry.

60
00:10:32,702 --> 00:10:36,272
We have prepared for this
moment for a long time.

61
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:39,309
I chose you
for a reason, Lui Kang.

62
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:41,978
Now, the others
will be gathering.

63
00:10:42,045 --> 00:10:43,880
We must hurry.

64
00:10:43,947 --> 00:10:46,516
Lord Raiden, what others?

65
00:10:48,885 --> 00:10:50,755
No, no, listen.

66
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:53,623
We can make this work,
I promise.

67
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,291
What do I have to do, huh?

68
00:10:55,358 --> 00:10:58,128
How about cleaning this
hell-hole you call a home?

69
00:10:58,194 --> 00:10:59,362
How about doing something

70
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:01,297
besides crying
about your career?

71
00:11:01,364 --> 00:11:03,733
You only care about yourself!

72
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:05,836
It's all about Johnny Cage.

73
00:11:05,902 --> 00:11:07,203
Call me when you grow up.

74
00:11:12,877 --> 00:11:16,346
So, I can still call her then.

75
00:11:16,413 --> 00:11:17,447
That's a W.

76
00:11:44,407 --> 00:11:46,877
Hey! You're in the cage
with Johnny.

77
00:11:46,943 --> 00:11:48,111
Oh, well.

78
00:11:48,178 --> 00:11:50,013
If it isn't my long-lost agent.

79
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,081
It's about time you called.

80
00:11:52,148 --> 00:11:54,517
Of course, I'm interested
in something different.

81
00:11:54,584 --> 00:11:56,754
What have I been
telling you? Yeah.

82
00:11:56,821 --> 00:11:58,154
China?

83
00:11:58,221 --> 00:12:01,724
Uh-huh. All right, well,
what about an advance?

84
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:03,894
Uh, things have gotten
a little...

85
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,361
Little tight around here.

86
00:12:07,765 --> 00:12:09,499
Hello? Hello.

87
00:12:10,266 --> 00:12:12,268
Well, I'm off to China!

88
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:35,692
Kick him in the face!

89
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:48,605
You gonna keep crying like
a bitch or fight like a man?

90
00:13:05,388 --> 00:13:07,524
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

91
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,592
This is no place
for a little girl.

92
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:12,997
This is
no place for a little girl...

93
00:13:13,062 --> 00:13:15,164
This is no place
for little girls.

94
00:13:15,231 --> 00:13:16,767
Hmm.

95
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:18,401
Do you think this is funny?

96
00:13:18,468 --> 00:13:20,336
Congratulations, cadet.

97
00:13:20,403 --> 00:13:24,842
You've just become
my new pet project.

98
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:28,678
<i>You think you're pretty
special, don't you, princess?</i>

99
00:13:28,746 --> 00:13:31,180
<i>Sir! My name is Sonya Blade,</i>

100
00:13:31,247 --> 00:13:35,485
<i>and I'm going to be the best
soldier you've ever met! Sir!</i>

101
00:13:35,552 --> 00:13:37,620
<i>We'll see about that.</i>

102
00:13:38,388 --> 00:13:40,189
You wanted to see me, sir?

103
00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:41,491
Yes, I did.

104
00:13:41,558 --> 00:13:43,426
I'm putting together
a task force.

105
00:13:43,493 --> 00:13:45,930
High-level spec ops stuff.

106
00:13:45,996 --> 00:13:47,330
Are you in?

107
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:56,673
I'm gonna kill you!

108
00:13:57,607 --> 00:13:58,842
You're gonna try.

109
00:14:11,922 --> 00:14:14,357
That's my car!

110
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,128
Not yet, whore.

111
00:14:29,472 --> 00:14:31,875
My teeth. My teeth!

112
00:14:31,942 --> 00:14:34,143
Honestly, it's an improvement.

113
00:14:34,979 --> 00:14:36,145
Oh, shit!

114
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:51,594
Sonya!

115
00:14:51,661 --> 00:14:53,596
Sonya! Sonya!

116
00:14:53,663 --> 00:14:55,331
Sonya! Sonya!

117
00:15:01,105 --> 00:15:02,438
He'll be there?

118
00:15:03,107 --> 00:15:04,674
If he's not,

119
00:15:04,742 --> 00:15:07,210
there's nowhere on Earth
you'll be able to hide from me.

120
00:15:07,276 --> 00:15:08,444
Understand?

121
00:15:32,635 --> 00:15:33,703
Satoshi.

122
00:15:34,337 --> 00:15:35,337
Harumi.

123
00:15:36,807 --> 00:15:38,108
What is this?

124
00:15:38,174 --> 00:15:39,442
Where am I?

125
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:54,524
Don't start without me.

126
00:15:55,692 --> 00:15:57,761
Ah!

127
00:15:57,828 --> 00:15:59,830
Fresh meat.

128
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,838
What in the hell...

129
00:16:08,872 --> 00:16:12,375
Close. Netherrealm.

130
00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:19,348
It's no use.

131
00:16:19,415 --> 00:16:22,285
You are a prisoner here.

132
00:16:24,922 --> 00:16:26,355
For how long?

133
00:16:29,993 --> 00:16:32,428
Forever.

134
00:16:33,362 --> 00:16:35,264
Listen.

135
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,271
Ah!

136
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,942
Do you hear it?

137
00:16:45,008 --> 00:16:47,610
The symphony of pain.

138
00:16:47,677 --> 00:16:51,481
Your voice will soon
join the others,

139
00:16:51,547 --> 00:16:56,352
rising up to please
the great Shinnok.

140
00:16:57,587 --> 00:16:58,956
Shinnok?

141
00:16:59,022 --> 00:17:01,892
The master of Netherrealm.

142
00:17:02,358 --> 00:17:04,560
There.

143
00:17:04,627 --> 00:17:09,732
The only place of reprieve
in this realm.

144
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,470
Look on it and weep.

145
00:17:21,812 --> 00:17:23,679
Sharp enough.

146
00:17:33,523 --> 00:17:36,026
Calm yourself.

147
00:17:36,093 --> 00:17:40,998
Save your energy
for what is about to come.

148
00:17:46,435 --> 00:17:48,437
Now you see,

149
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,374
you feel pain,

150
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,045
though you can no longer perish.

151
00:17:55,112 --> 00:17:57,513
We can do this

152
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,051
for all eternity.

153
00:18:05,923 --> 00:18:07,224
Huh?

154
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,159
What is it you say?

155
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:15,265
Is that a prayer?

156
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:16,465
No.

157
00:18:16,532 --> 00:18:20,804
No God can help you here.

158
00:18:20,871 --> 00:18:22,773
I need no God!

159
00:18:42,025 --> 00:18:45,494
I will take pleasure
in ripping your flesh

160
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:47,297
from your bones!

161
00:19:19,595 --> 00:19:21,631
Human,

162
00:19:21,697 --> 00:19:24,700
you have made a big mistake.

163
00:19:30,274 --> 00:19:34,945
There are thousands of us,
and only one of you.

164
00:19:41,752 --> 00:19:43,820
Minus one.

165
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,558
Shinnok!

166
00:20:23,994 --> 00:20:26,396
No, Shinnok is...

167
00:20:26,462 --> 00:20:27,596
indisposed.

168
00:20:27,663 --> 00:20:29,800
Then go fetch him for me.

169
00:20:29,866 --> 00:20:31,600
If only I could.

170
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:33,669
I am Quan Chi,

171
00:20:33,736 --> 00:20:35,872
in charge of this realm

172
00:20:35,939 --> 00:20:37,640
until the master's return.

173
00:20:37,707 --> 00:20:41,644
And who do I have
to thank for ruining my rug?

174
00:20:41,711 --> 00:20:43,113
Hanzo Hasashi.

175
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,950
Your reputation precedes you,
Hanzo Hasashi.

176
00:20:47,017 --> 00:20:48,785
Welcome. Though,

177
00:20:48,852 --> 00:20:51,922
I'm not entirely sure
how you made it here.

178
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:55,125
What is it you want, Hanzo?

179
00:20:55,192 --> 00:20:56,760
To return home.

180
00:20:56,827 --> 00:20:59,029
To seek my revenge.

181
00:20:59,096 --> 00:21:00,364
Home?

182
00:21:02,366 --> 00:21:04,500
You can't return home.

183
00:21:06,436 --> 00:21:08,438
You will do as I say,

184
00:21:08,504 --> 00:21:11,074
or I will flay you alive.

185
00:21:17,848 --> 00:21:20,683
Did you think me
defenseless, dog?

186
00:21:20,751 --> 00:21:23,286
In my realm no less.

187
00:21:24,653 --> 00:21:26,857
You may be a vengeful spirit,

188
00:21:26,923 --> 00:21:30,027
but even they have their limits.

189
00:21:44,174 --> 00:21:48,577
Besides, that's not what
you really want, is it?

190
00:21:50,613 --> 00:21:53,283
Once a generation,
there is a tournament.

191
00:21:54,384 --> 00:21:55,684
During that time,

192
00:21:55,752 --> 00:21:57,487
the veil is lifted,

193
00:21:57,553 --> 00:22:01,657
so that warriors may gather to
fight on behalf of their realm.

194
00:22:01,724 --> 00:22:03,592
I can send you there.

195
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:07,596
Why would I fight for you?

196
00:22:07,663 --> 00:22:11,201
Because he will
be in attendance.

197
00:22:15,571 --> 00:22:17,774
What do you want?

198
00:22:17,841 --> 00:22:22,746
Good, skilled and smart.

199
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,049
Long ago,

200
00:22:26,116 --> 00:22:30,053
my master, Shinnok,
was unjustly imprisoned.

201
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,090
This is the key to his release.

202
00:22:33,156 --> 00:22:36,126
It's being kept
at the temple of Shang Tsung,

203
00:22:36,193 --> 00:22:37,693
the putrid mortal

204
00:22:37,761 --> 00:22:40,797
that has the favor
of the emperor of Outworld.

205
00:22:40,864 --> 00:22:44,167
The tournament will take place
on his island.

206
00:22:44,234 --> 00:22:46,669
Get me that key.

207
00:22:46,735 --> 00:22:49,339
Once my master is released,

208
00:22:49,406 --> 00:22:51,541
he can return your family.

209
00:22:51,607 --> 00:22:55,512
Even you,
back to the mortal realm.

210
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:58,782
Do we understand
each other, Hanzo?

211
00:23:01,184 --> 00:23:03,320
Hanzo is dead.

212
00:23:03,386 --> 00:23:05,322
Call me Scorpion.

213
00:23:13,497 --> 00:23:16,266
Hold the boat! I'm coming!

214
00:23:21,637 --> 00:23:24,341
Coming through. I'm co...

215
00:23:24,407 --> 00:23:27,511
Whoa, whoa...

216
00:23:27,577 --> 00:23:28,745
Hmm.

217
00:23:32,983 --> 00:23:33,983
Mmm?

218
00:23:37,787 --> 00:23:41,791
Hope no fans saw that.
I'm wearing slip-ons.

219
00:23:46,396 --> 00:23:48,932
Lui Kang,
of the White Lotus Society.

220
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:51,601
Johnny Cage,
of the superstar variety,

221
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:53,570
but you probably knew that.

222
00:23:53,637 --> 00:23:55,138
And you are?

223
00:23:55,805 --> 00:23:57,474
Not interested.

224
00:23:57,541 --> 00:24:00,043
Oh, you will be.
They always are.

225
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,279
So, you guys in this thing, too?

226
00:24:02,345 --> 00:24:05,482
Yes, I have trained
many years for this moment.

227
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:07,017
Oh, yeah? Listen,

228
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:08,418
I love acting classes and all,

229
00:24:08,485 --> 00:24:10,921
but they're really
kind of a time suck.

230
00:24:10,987 --> 00:24:12,688
You know what I mean?
No? Anyway,

231
00:24:12,756 --> 00:24:15,025
my agent said this would
really put me back on the map.

232
00:24:15,091 --> 00:24:17,427
Kind of a back-end-deal-type-of-thing.
Should be fun.

233
00:24:17,494 --> 00:24:19,728
We are approaching the veil.

234
00:24:21,565 --> 00:24:22,698
Who is that? Let me guess.

235
00:24:22,766 --> 00:24:24,801
He's kind of like
our, uh, Merlin.

236
00:24:24,868 --> 00:24:26,570
That is Lord Raiden.

237
00:24:26,636 --> 00:24:28,171
Protector of Earthrealm.

238
00:24:28,238 --> 00:24:30,874
Boom! Nailed it.
Wait, Earthrealm?

239
00:24:30,941 --> 00:24:32,652
Did you guys get
a script already or something?

240
00:24:32,676 --> 00:24:33,977
Look, I'd love a copy.

241
00:24:34,044 --> 00:24:36,112
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

242
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:38,448
but I am pretty good
at improv. So, uh...

243
00:24:39,816 --> 00:24:41,751
Lord Raiden, right?

244
00:24:41,818 --> 00:24:42,886
Good to meet you.

245
00:24:42,953 --> 00:24:46,323
So, tell me more
about this veil.

246
00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:48,124
The space between realms,

247
00:24:48,191 --> 00:24:51,695
to prevent Outworld
from merging with Earthrealm.

248
00:24:51,761 --> 00:24:52,929
Prevented by what?

249
00:24:52,996 --> 00:24:54,798
Always the soldier,

250
00:24:54,864 --> 00:24:56,900
evaluating risks.

251
00:24:56,967 --> 00:25:01,638
What guards the veil is of less
consequence than why it does so.

252
00:25:01,705 --> 00:25:03,940
If Shao Kahn
wins this tournament,

253
00:25:04,007 --> 00:25:07,510
Earth, as you know it,
will cease to exist.

254
00:25:07,577 --> 00:25:08,912
Not to fear, Lord Raiden.

255
00:25:08,979 --> 00:25:10,513
I, Johnny Cage,

256
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,049
will make sure that
Earthrealm, so dumb,

257
00:25:13,116 --> 00:25:15,018
will be safe from harm.

258
00:25:15,085 --> 00:25:16,920
You have my word on it.

259
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:26,029
Lord Raiden,
these are the champions you gathered?

260
00:25:26,096 --> 00:25:28,298
You doubt my choices?

261
00:25:28,365 --> 00:25:29,833
No, I just meant...

262
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:33,169
You see only what is in front
of you, Lui Kang,

263
00:25:33,236 --> 00:25:35,138
but your eyes deceive you.

264
00:25:35,205 --> 00:25:38,208
It is what is inside
that matters.

265
00:25:38,275 --> 00:25:39,744
Sonya Blade,

266
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:42,012
a most formidable warrior.

267
00:25:42,078 --> 00:25:44,381
She has had
to prove herself against many

268
00:25:44,447 --> 00:25:48,785
who thought she was
nothing more than a weak girl.

269
00:25:48,852 --> 00:25:51,554
Believe me,
she is anything but.

270
00:25:51,621 --> 00:25:55,358
And him? He only seems to be concerned
about himself and material wealth.

271
00:25:58,028 --> 00:25:59,462
That will keep him alive,

272
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:02,932
until he finds something more
to care about.

273
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:05,802
Something greater
than himself to live for.

274
00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:07,637
Are you kidding me?

275
00:26:07,704 --> 00:26:10,082
I paid extra for international,
and I can't even get a signal.

276
00:26:10,106 --> 00:26:12,108
Uh, Raiden, are getting one?

277
00:26:18,982 --> 00:26:20,317
What in the...

278
00:26:24,654 --> 00:26:25,889
Stay in the vessel.

279
00:26:25,955 --> 00:26:28,058
It is under
Lord Raiden's protection.

280
00:26:28,124 --> 00:26:30,727
Out there,
there's nothing good.

281
00:26:30,795 --> 00:26:32,829
Oh, right.

282
00:26:32,896 --> 00:26:34,197
Paparazzi.

283
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:36,499
We've arrived.

284
00:27:14,471 --> 00:27:15,872
Look.

285
00:27:25,915 --> 00:27:27,917
That must be the bad guy.

286
00:27:31,521 --> 00:27:33,556
One at a time, everybody.
One at a time.

287
00:27:33,623 --> 00:27:35,992
Brought enough
for everyone. Okay.

288
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:37,394
Where'd you guys put my trailer?

289
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,696
I'd like to freshen up
before we start shooting.

290
00:27:39,764 --> 00:27:41,231
Ugh.

291
00:27:44,434 --> 00:27:46,603
He has no idea what he is doing.

292
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:48,004
Should we tell him?

293
00:27:48,071 --> 00:27:50,808
His journey is one of discovery.

294
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:53,543
Besides, I find it amusing.

295
00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:09,159
Remember our deal, Scorpion.

296
00:28:39,022 --> 00:28:40,190
Whoa.

297
00:28:52,969 --> 00:28:54,404
Yeah! Yeah!

298
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:21,998
Be on guard.

299
00:29:22,065 --> 00:29:24,400
Shang Tsung
is not to be trusted.

300
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:26,536
Oh, look!
Craft services. Great!

301
00:29:41,117 --> 00:29:44,521
Hey, do you know if
any of this stuff is organic?

302
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,657
Just asking. Geez!

303
00:29:55,031 --> 00:29:57,133
Now is your chance.

304
00:30:24,661 --> 00:30:26,429
<i>In the beginning,</i>

305
00:30:26,496 --> 00:30:28,631
<i>were the elder Gods.</i>

306
00:30:29,699 --> 00:30:31,467
<i>In their wisdom,</i>

307
00:30:31,534 --> 00:30:33,336
<i>they created a tournament</i>

308
00:30:33,403 --> 00:30:38,107
<i>to safeguard each realm
from the threat of invasion.</i>

309
00:30:38,174 --> 00:30:39,877
<i>Once a generation,</i>

310
00:30:39,944 --> 00:30:42,345
<i>the finest warriors
must do battle</i>

311
00:30:42,412 --> 00:30:45,315
<i>to decide the fate
of their realm.</i>

312
00:30:45,381 --> 00:30:47,918
<i>The winner will be
granted long life</i>

313
00:30:47,985 --> 00:30:49,719
<i>and great power.</i>

314
00:30:49,787 --> 00:30:53,356
<i>If one realm wins
the tournament ten times,</i>

315
00:30:53,423 --> 00:30:56,026
<i>they will have the right
to merge with the other,</i>

316
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:58,796
<i>and rule as they see fit.</i>

317
00:30:58,862 --> 00:31:01,164
<i>I, Shang Tsung,</i>

318
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,733
<i>emissary of the great Shao Kahn,</i>

319
00:31:03,801 --> 00:31:05,970
<i>emperor of Outworld,</i>

320
00:31:06,036 --> 00:31:10,607
<i>winner of the last nine
tournaments against Earthrealm,</i>

321
00:31:10,673 --> 00:31:14,210
welcome you to Mortal Kombat.

322
00:31:14,277 --> 00:31:17,547
Mortal Kombat!

323
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,561
Now,

324
00:32:05,628 --> 00:32:07,798
as host of this tournament,

325
00:32:07,865 --> 00:32:12,036
I think it only fitting that
I provide you with some...

326
00:32:12,102 --> 00:32:14,303
entertainment.

327
00:32:22,578 --> 00:32:23,646
Kano.

328
00:32:31,088 --> 00:32:32,856
Jax!

329
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:44,534
Jax!

330
00:32:46,036 --> 00:32:47,838
Listen, you son of a bitch,

331
00:32:47,905 --> 00:32:50,606
you better open this,
whatever it is,

332
00:32:50,673 --> 00:32:54,377
or I'm gonna use your ass as
my own personal punching bag.

333
00:32:54,444 --> 00:32:55,979
Oh, that is so hot.

334
00:33:00,117 --> 00:33:02,285
- Princess.
- Asshole.

335
00:33:02,351 --> 00:33:04,021
I told you to wait for me.

336
00:33:04,088 --> 00:33:05,388
I got excited.

337
00:33:05,455 --> 00:33:08,158
You got caught
by that idiot Kano.

338
00:33:08,224 --> 00:33:11,161
Yeah, that too.

339
00:33:11,227 --> 00:33:15,631
Unless you want me to rip that
pencil-thin mustache off your face,

340
00:33:15,698 --> 00:33:18,969
I think it's best
you let me go, old man.

341
00:33:19,036 --> 00:33:20,570
Absolutely.

342
00:33:20,636 --> 00:33:23,207
You are free
to leave at any time.

343
00:33:23,272 --> 00:33:25,608
The doorway is right there.

344
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,678
Of course,

345
00:33:28,746 --> 00:33:31,115
you have to get past
my champion.

346
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:37,653
Goro! Goro! Goro!

347
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:41,792
Goro! Goro! Goro!

348
00:34:04,815 --> 00:34:06,016
What the hell?

349
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:25,936
Jax! No!

350
00:34:26,003 --> 00:34:28,371
Relax, kid. I've got this.

351
00:34:28,437 --> 00:34:30,140
All right, ugly.

352
00:34:30,207 --> 00:34:31,742
You wanna dance?

353
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:33,143
Let's dance.

354
00:34:58,334 --> 00:34:59,669
I wouldn't.

355
00:35:03,073 --> 00:35:04,607
Let me guess.

356
00:35:04,674 --> 00:35:08,377
Quan Chi promised you life
if you would do his bidding.

357
00:35:08,812 --> 00:35:11,114
Ah... No.

358
00:35:11,181 --> 00:35:13,951
Not you. Someone else.

359
00:35:14,017 --> 00:35:15,718
Someone you lost.

360
00:35:15,786 --> 00:35:17,754
Someone you care about.

361
00:35:17,821 --> 00:35:20,958
Do you think Quan Chi
is a man to be trusted?

362
00:35:21,024 --> 00:35:23,260
What choice do I have?

363
00:35:23,327 --> 00:35:25,162
We all have choices.

364
00:35:25,229 --> 00:35:26,662
Live in the past,

365
00:35:26,729 --> 00:35:29,599
or live for the future.

366
00:35:29,665 --> 00:35:32,501
The key won't
solve your problems.

367
00:35:32,568 --> 00:35:36,106
It will, however,
create new ones.

368
00:35:36,173 --> 00:35:37,506
And my revenge?

369
00:35:37,573 --> 00:35:41,078
Revenge is too heavy
a burden to carry.

370
00:35:41,144 --> 00:35:42,712
You are a free man.

371
00:35:42,779 --> 00:35:44,882
It's time you start
acting like it.

372
00:36:27,257 --> 00:36:30,894
Really, Goro, you shouldn't
play with your food.

373
00:36:49,112 --> 00:36:50,914
Stop it! You'll kill him.

374
00:36:50,981 --> 00:36:52,983
That's the idea.

375
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,384
Finish him.

376
00:37:02,993 --> 00:37:03,993
No!

377
00:37:05,929 --> 00:37:07,097
Yeah!

378
00:37:13,971 --> 00:37:16,373
Pfft! Fake.

379
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,041
These special effects suck.

380
00:37:22,446 --> 00:37:23,646
Enough!

381
00:37:34,157 --> 00:37:36,960
You forget
yourself, Lord Raiden.

382
00:37:37,027 --> 00:37:39,595
You are not to interfere
in the tournament.

383
00:37:39,662 --> 00:37:42,631
I was unaware
the tournament had begun.

384
00:37:54,344 --> 00:37:57,513
We are here for Mortal Kombat,

385
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,050
not your barbarism.

386
00:38:01,451 --> 00:38:03,020
As you wish.

387
00:38:03,086 --> 00:38:04,086
Kano!

388
00:38:08,091 --> 00:38:09,259
Jax!

389
00:38:09,326 --> 00:38:11,627
Hold on! I'm coming for you!

390
00:38:11,694 --> 00:38:12,996
You hear me?

391
00:38:13,063 --> 00:38:16,266
No matter what!
I'm coming for you!

392
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:18,435
Wow! She's great.

393
00:38:18,502 --> 00:38:21,271
I mean,
that is some serious method acting there.

394
00:38:21,338 --> 00:38:22,372
Am I right?

395
00:38:25,042 --> 00:38:28,644
I can see we're all anxious
to get started.

396
00:38:29,246 --> 00:38:30,713
Good.

397
00:38:30,781 --> 00:38:33,016
I have determined your opponents

398
00:38:33,083 --> 00:38:35,819
and where on the island
you will fight.

399
00:38:35,886 --> 00:38:38,321
Let Mortal Kombat begin!

400
00:38:51,068 --> 00:38:53,470
Uh... Okay.

401
00:38:53,537 --> 00:38:54,771
That was weird.

402
00:38:54,838 --> 00:38:57,140
Did someone slip me something?

403
00:38:57,207 --> 00:38:58,641
Or... Holy shit!

404
00:39:02,711 --> 00:39:04,915
Hello? Sonya?

405
00:39:04,981 --> 00:39:07,784
Lord Reagan? Radar?
Whatever your name is.

406
00:39:09,853 --> 00:39:11,988
This thing better not
go straight to video.

407
00:39:28,805 --> 00:39:30,006
Gunpowder?

408
00:39:30,073 --> 00:39:32,242
Must be some
sort of old fortress.

409
00:39:45,455 --> 00:39:46,622
Bingo.

410
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:57,968
Hard as a fossil.

411
00:39:58,034 --> 00:39:59,503
No craft services, no trailers.

412
00:39:59,569 --> 00:40:01,905
My agent is gonna hear
about this when I get home.

413
00:40:04,841 --> 00:40:07,643
Sheesh.

414
00:40:08,311 --> 00:40:10,046
Hello?

415
00:40:10,113 --> 00:40:12,082
I should at least get
a per diem.

416
00:40:14,851 --> 00:40:16,719
Oh, hey, how's it goin'?

417
00:40:16,786 --> 00:40:19,655
That... That is
one hell of a costume.

418
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,729
Uh... Are we live?

419
00:40:26,796 --> 00:40:28,965
Like, you wanna do this now?

420
00:40:33,803 --> 00:40:35,906
Whoa, buddy, pro-tip.

421
00:40:35,972 --> 00:40:37,941
Uh, next time, pop a few mints.

422
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,382
Whoa! Whoa! Go easy!

423
00:40:45,448 --> 00:40:46,883
We haven't even rehearsed.

424
00:40:49,286 --> 00:40:50,220
Hey, asshole!

425
00:40:50,287 --> 00:40:53,423
That was custom! Dick.

426
00:41:01,898 --> 00:41:03,732
And barrel.

427
00:41:59,022 --> 00:42:00,490
Eat me, buttercup.

428
00:42:16,673 --> 00:42:18,074
Toasty.

429
00:42:56,713 --> 00:42:59,582
Come on! Face me like a man!

430
00:43:26,576 --> 00:43:29,045
All right, asshole.
Let's see what you've got.

431
00:44:30,775 --> 00:44:33,676
Not so fun now, is it,
you cold-blooded bastard?

432
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,313
Heads up!

433
00:44:41,684 --> 00:44:45,488
Fuck with the Blade,
you're gonna get cut.

434
00:45:11,882 --> 00:45:14,551
You move like the Shirai Ryu.

435
00:45:14,617 --> 00:45:16,219
But they're dead.

436
00:45:16,286 --> 00:45:18,521
Who are you? What do you want?

437
00:45:19,422 --> 00:45:20,557
Revenge!

438
00:45:24,895 --> 00:45:27,230
Tell me, Lin Kuei scum,

439
00:45:27,297 --> 00:45:29,098
where is Sub-Zero?

440
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:37,140
Die, knowing I will kill
every last member

441
00:45:37,207 --> 00:45:40,076
of the Lin Kuei on this island.

442
00:45:40,143 --> 00:45:43,580
Every last one.

443
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:05,502
You are Raiden's chosen one.

444
00:46:05,568 --> 00:46:08,404
No wonder your realm
has lost so many tournaments.

445
00:46:18,114 --> 00:46:19,682
I do not wish to hurt you.

446
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,484
Spare me your pity.

447
00:46:33,931 --> 00:46:36,366
Do not get up.

448
00:46:36,432 --> 00:46:39,402
I take no pleasure in hurting
such a worthy foe.

449
00:46:39,469 --> 00:46:42,171
But, know this.
I will do whatever it takes

450
00:46:42,238 --> 00:46:44,707
to defend Earthrealm,
and win this tournament.

451
00:46:46,342 --> 00:46:48,177
Then you are a fool.

452
00:46:48,244 --> 00:46:50,680
Shao Kahn cannot be defeated.

453
00:46:50,748 --> 00:46:53,216
He will take your world,
and you will bow your knee

454
00:46:53,283 --> 00:46:54,919
like countless others
before you.

455
00:46:54,985 --> 00:46:59,255
I promise you, I will never bow
before that madman.

456
00:47:02,158 --> 00:47:03,359
I yield.

457
00:47:06,629 --> 00:47:09,232
What makes you so sure
you will win?

458
00:47:09,299 --> 00:47:12,870
Because I have something
no one in Outworld has.

459
00:47:12,937 --> 00:47:15,171
- What?
- Hope.

460
00:47:32,622 --> 00:47:34,624
Impressive, Raiden.

461
00:47:34,691 --> 00:47:37,527
Your warriors have made it
further than I would have thought.

462
00:47:37,594 --> 00:47:41,197
They are strong in spirit,
Shang Tsung.

463
00:47:41,264 --> 00:47:43,333
You will not win today.

464
00:47:43,399 --> 00:47:46,971
I have heard
such promises before.

465
00:47:47,037 --> 00:47:49,172
Thankfully, after Goro kills

466
00:47:49,238 --> 00:47:51,708
whomever makes it
to the final round,

467
00:47:51,775 --> 00:47:54,510
I will not have to
hear them again.

468
00:47:54,577 --> 00:47:58,782
And, Quan Chi,
your warrior from Netherrealm,

469
00:47:58,849 --> 00:48:01,085
he is proving to be
quite formidable.

470
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,286
For the glory of Outworld,

471
00:48:03,353 --> 00:48:06,522
I serve at the pleasure
of Shao Kahn.

472
00:48:07,791 --> 00:48:08,892
Indeed.

473
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,693
You won't succeed.

474
00:48:10,761 --> 00:48:13,129
No matter how many foes
you put between

475
00:48:13,196 --> 00:48:15,531
the Earthrealm fighters
and your champion,

476
00:48:15,598 --> 00:48:17,433
they will make it to the end.

477
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:21,404
Oh? I'm glad you feel that way.

478
00:48:21,471 --> 00:48:24,707
Surely you know
of the Black Dragon.

479
00:48:24,775 --> 00:48:27,443
It seems that several have
made it onto the island

480
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:30,313
with orders to kill
your Earthrealm friends.

481
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,950
How dare you?

482
00:48:33,017 --> 00:48:36,020
Are you accusing me
of something, Lord Raiden?

483
00:48:36,086 --> 00:48:37,320
You brought them here

484
00:48:37,387 --> 00:48:38,922
to interfere
with the tournament!

485
00:48:38,989 --> 00:48:41,257
And break the rules?

486
00:48:41,324 --> 00:48:43,593
Even I am not so bold
as to anger

487
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:46,329
the elder Gods in such a way.

488
00:48:46,396 --> 00:48:49,133
You will not succeed,
Shang Tsung.

489
00:48:49,198 --> 00:48:52,168
We'll know soon enough,
won't we?

490
00:49:04,948 --> 00:49:08,786
What I wouldn't give
for a frozen margarita.

491
00:49:13,389 --> 00:49:14,691
Hey!

492
00:49:14,758 --> 00:49:15,926
Really?

493
00:49:15,993 --> 00:49:18,628
I know, look at this shirt.
It's ridiculous.

494
00:49:18,695 --> 00:49:20,530
I'm glad to see you, though.

495
00:49:20,596 --> 00:49:22,432
Okay, you won't believe this,

496
00:49:22,498 --> 00:49:24,802
but this isn't
some sort of movie.

497
00:49:24,868 --> 00:49:28,337
This is the real deal. Maybe a snuff
film or something. I don't know.

498
00:49:28,404 --> 00:49:30,306
But I had to fight some, uh...

499
00:49:30,373 --> 00:49:32,042
I don't even know what it was.

500
00:49:32,109 --> 00:49:34,111
I barely got out alive.

501
00:49:34,178 --> 00:49:35,511
I can believe that.

502
00:49:35,578 --> 00:49:37,480
Listen, I'll get you
out of here,

503
00:49:37,547 --> 00:49:38,949
but we'll need to
stick together.

504
00:49:39,016 --> 00:49:42,086
First rule of combat
is to secure our position.

505
00:49:42,152 --> 00:49:43,328
Let's find somewhere to hole up,

506
00:49:43,352 --> 00:49:44,755
and then we can start recon.

507
00:49:44,822 --> 00:49:46,957
Find out where we are,
what we are up against.

508
00:49:47,024 --> 00:49:48,291
A sound strategy.

509
00:49:49,026 --> 00:49:50,693
You both made it. Good.

510
00:49:50,761 --> 00:49:52,628
I fear it's only
going to get harder from here.

511
00:49:52,695 --> 00:49:54,832
Whoa. Wait,
what's gonna get harder?

512
00:49:54,898 --> 00:49:57,835
I just fought a walking pair of
teeth on the side of a mountain.

513
00:49:57,901 --> 00:50:00,838
I'm not Tom Cruise,
you know. I act.

514
00:50:00,904 --> 00:50:03,539
I leave that stunt shit
for the stunt people.

515
00:50:03,606 --> 00:50:05,743
Listen, sweetheart,
we should get out of here...

516
00:50:05,809 --> 00:50:08,112
Oh, my... dick.

517
00:50:08,178 --> 00:50:11,949
Fuckballs, no one touches me
without permission, you got it?

518
00:50:12,015 --> 00:50:13,117
Got it.

519
00:50:13,183 --> 00:50:14,326
You said you knew where we were?

520
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:15,451
I do.

521
00:50:15,518 --> 00:50:17,020
But it will be dark soon.

522
00:50:17,087 --> 00:50:19,223
We need to make camp. Rest.

523
00:50:19,288 --> 00:50:20,389
Agreed.

524
00:50:24,594 --> 00:50:27,765
No, no. Don't wait for me.
I'm fine.

525
00:50:27,831 --> 00:50:30,100
Let me just pee out
some blood first.

526
00:50:45,883 --> 00:50:47,583
What the fuck?

527
00:50:50,486 --> 00:50:53,656
I think I'm gonna be sick.

528
00:50:56,459 --> 00:50:58,594
Stay behind me.
I'll take care of this.

529
00:50:58,661 --> 00:51:00,496
What is this, 1950?

530
00:51:00,563 --> 00:51:03,499
Step back, Bruce Lee.
Bring it, bitch.

531
00:51:03,566 --> 00:51:06,702
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
everyone just chillax, okay?

532
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:08,471
No one needs to fight anyone.

533
00:51:08,538 --> 00:51:10,140
Especially some guy
that just went psycho

534
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,141
on a bunch of, uh...

535
00:51:11,208 --> 00:51:13,944
Black Dragon. Mercenaries.

536
00:51:14,011 --> 00:51:16,479
Assassins. Bad guys.

537
00:51:16,546 --> 00:51:17,948
Yeah, those guys.

538
00:51:18,015 --> 00:51:19,249
We have to continue.

539
00:51:19,315 --> 00:51:21,118
Once Mortal Kombat
has been declared,

540
00:51:21,185 --> 00:51:22,186
it must be finished.

541
00:51:22,252 --> 00:51:25,222
Did you declare Mortal Kombat?

542
00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:26,890
- Did you?
- Nope.

543
00:51:26,957 --> 00:51:29,827
What about you, Mister...

544
00:51:29,893 --> 00:51:31,161
Scorpion.

545
00:51:31,228 --> 00:51:33,263
Oh, it's catchy. I like that.

546
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:34,697
Did you declare Mortal Kombat?

547
00:51:35,866 --> 00:51:39,102
Good. Good. Great!
Then no one needs to die.

548
00:51:39,169 --> 00:51:40,603
Sheesh.

549
00:51:42,206 --> 00:51:44,041
Now, who's hungry?

550
00:51:50,413 --> 00:51:53,116
I know you didn't believe
it before, but it's all true.

551
00:51:53,183 --> 00:51:56,320
The elder Gods,
the tournament, everything.

552
00:51:56,385 --> 00:52:00,157
Emperor Shao Kahn has won nine
previous Mortal Kombat tournaments.

553
00:52:00,224 --> 00:52:01,825
If he wins a tenth...

554
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:03,760
Then what?

555
00:52:03,827 --> 00:52:06,029
Then you all die.

556
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:08,531
Great. Just great.

557
00:52:08,598 --> 00:52:12,602
Yeah. Okay, monsters, magic,
this can't be real.

558
00:52:12,668 --> 00:52:14,513
Somebody must have slipped
something into my drink.

559
00:52:14,537 --> 00:52:17,307
- I'm hallucinating.
- Get a grip, Johnny.

560
00:52:17,373 --> 00:52:19,743
Whatever this is, it's real.

561
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:22,813
There's no use sitting around
and whining about it.

562
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,513
If what Lui Kang says is true,

563
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,183
then the whole world
is in trouble,

564
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,918
and we have to stop it.

565
00:52:28,584 --> 00:52:30,620
If I can get to a radio,

566
00:52:30,686 --> 00:52:33,522
a communications array,
I can call in reinforcements.

567
00:52:33,589 --> 00:52:37,227
Turn this island
into the next cautionary tale.

568
00:52:37,294 --> 00:52:39,428
If only it were that easy.

569
00:52:39,495 --> 00:52:42,065
- Lord Raiden.
- You.

570
00:52:42,132 --> 00:52:44,077
What do you mean,
"If only it were that easy"?

571
00:52:44,101 --> 00:52:46,636
Do you know
what a Hellfire missile can do?

572
00:52:46,702 --> 00:52:49,672
I'm sure it's very powerful
on Earth.

573
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,843
But we are not on Earth.

574
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:56,880
This island lives in a place
between realms.

575
00:52:56,947 --> 00:52:59,816
A place set aside specifically
for the tournament.

576
00:52:59,883 --> 00:53:01,852
Uh-huh. Sure. Sounds great.

577
00:53:01,919 --> 00:53:04,855
So, if what Lui Kang
says is true,

578
00:53:04,922 --> 00:53:08,258
then you're really
some sort of God, right?

579
00:53:08,325 --> 00:53:10,260
I have been given many names.

580
00:53:10,327 --> 00:53:11,460
Well, shoot, Buddha!

581
00:53:11,527 --> 00:53:13,096
Snap your fingers. Get us home!

582
00:53:13,163 --> 00:53:15,866
I'm done with psycho monsters
and bad food.

583
00:53:15,933 --> 00:53:17,901
And by the way,
I'll never complain

584
00:53:17,968 --> 00:53:20,569
about doing a sequel again
in my life.

585
00:53:20,636 --> 00:53:23,006
He cannot.
Lord Raiden is forbidden

586
00:53:23,073 --> 00:53:25,108
from interfering
in the tournament.

587
00:53:25,175 --> 00:53:27,244
It is a bargain he made
to save Earthrealm

588
00:53:27,311 --> 00:53:29,112
from being taken over eons ago.

589
00:53:29,179 --> 00:53:30,948
Well, that's insane.

590
00:53:31,014 --> 00:53:33,383
The fate of the world
is being decided

591
00:53:33,449 --> 00:53:35,385
by some sort of
karate tournament?

592
00:53:35,451 --> 00:53:36,787
Are you kidding me?

593
00:53:36,853 --> 00:53:39,923
You are the only hope left
for Earthrealm.

594
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:44,027
Head toward the temple where
your final battles await...

595
00:53:44,094 --> 00:53:46,930
and your destinies
will be made clear.

596
00:53:46,997 --> 00:53:48,497
But be on guard.

597
00:53:48,564 --> 00:53:49,967
There are others on this island

598
00:53:50,033 --> 00:53:53,003
who will try to keep you
from the final round.

599
00:53:57,573 --> 00:54:00,344
Great. So, uh,
we are screwed.

600
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:03,612
If Lord Raiden believes
we can make it, we can.

601
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:06,549
No, you can't.

602
00:54:06,615 --> 00:54:09,585
Well, you seem very fun,
Mr. Scorpion.

603
00:54:09,652 --> 00:54:11,487
Shang Tsung has the numbers.

604
00:54:11,554 --> 00:54:14,791
He has that... monster.

605
00:54:14,858 --> 00:54:18,728
Go. Hide in the jungle
until it is over.

606
00:54:18,795 --> 00:54:20,696
And let Earth be destroyed?

607
00:54:20,764 --> 00:54:23,233
Sorry, pal.
I took an oath to defend it,

608
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,633
no matter the odds.

609
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,236
He would not understand, Sonya.

610
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,938
Someone such as him,

611
00:54:28,005 --> 00:54:30,240
has never known anything
worth dying for.

612
00:54:32,608 --> 00:54:34,543
You cannot survive.

613
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:38,614
My will is strong.
My destiny is my own.

614
00:54:40,951 --> 00:54:44,354
You are as naive,
as you are doomed.

615
00:54:44,421 --> 00:54:46,256
I have waited here too long.

616
00:54:46,323 --> 00:54:51,194
Know that the next time
we meet, it will not end well.

617
00:54:52,628 --> 00:54:54,663
Well, that was cheery.

618
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:56,266
Shut up, botox.

619
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:58,769
I'm just sayin', he really
killed the vibe around here.

620
00:54:58,835 --> 00:55:00,603
I was just...

621
00:55:01,872 --> 00:55:04,374
Shutting up. Yep.

622
00:55:04,441 --> 00:55:05,650
Scorpion was right about
one thing,

623
00:55:05,674 --> 00:55:07,411
we've rested long enough.

624
00:55:07,477 --> 00:55:08,879
We must continue on.

625
00:55:14,117 --> 00:55:15,285
I've found them.

626
00:55:25,095 --> 00:55:28,031
So, we're here,
now what?

627
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:36,973
Oh, great. This is fair.

628
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,376
The rules state
that it must be single combat.

629
00:55:39,443 --> 00:55:41,610
These lads aren't here
for the tournament.

630
00:55:41,677 --> 00:55:43,814
They've been paid to kill you.

631
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:48,485
Hello, love.
Nice to see you again. Mwah.

632
00:55:48,552 --> 00:55:51,521
Why don't you come over here
and I'll give you a hug?

633
00:55:51,587 --> 00:55:53,857
Well, you'd do a better job
than Jax.

634
00:55:59,563 --> 00:56:00,997
I guess Raiden was wrong.

635
00:56:01,064 --> 00:56:03,233
- Oh, you think?
- No, stay together.

636
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,302
We'll survive. We have to.

637
00:56:05,368 --> 00:56:06,803
Yeah, we better.

638
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:09,072
I need to make it home,
so I can kill my agent.

639
00:56:17,613 --> 00:56:19,715
- Be ready.
- For what?

640
00:56:23,652 --> 00:56:24,921
Aah!

641
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:02,125
You see? I knew he liked us.

642
00:57:10,834 --> 00:57:12,402
Stay down!

643
00:57:12,469 --> 00:57:15,805
I know how to fight...

644
00:57:21,578 --> 00:57:24,181
Sure you do. Just stay down.

645
00:57:26,816 --> 00:57:28,717
Oh, man, is she hot!

646
00:58:27,644 --> 00:58:28,644
Down!

647
00:58:38,521 --> 00:58:40,023
Huh? What gives?

648
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:42,892
You dishonor this tournament.

649
00:58:55,972 --> 00:58:58,108
You will die for what you did!

650
00:59:37,714 --> 00:59:39,316
That's for my clan!

651
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:42,452
This is for my wife!

652
00:59:45,822 --> 00:59:48,692
And this is for my son.

653
01:00:12,349 --> 01:00:14,918
Screw it. He's not
paying me enough for this.

654
01:00:14,984 --> 01:00:16,486
Kano!

655
01:00:17,721 --> 01:00:19,556
Go, save your partner.

656
01:00:19,622 --> 01:00:20,890
Sonya.

657
01:00:21,324 --> 01:00:22,425
Partner?

658
01:00:22,492 --> 01:00:25,328
Raiden said your
destiny would be clear.

659
01:00:25,395 --> 01:00:26,996
So, there she is.

660
01:00:27,063 --> 01:00:30,433
You know what, I guess I don't
mind having my balls crushed.

661
01:00:31,468 --> 01:00:32,803
By her, I mean.

662
01:00:32,869 --> 01:00:34,270
Doesn't make it any better.

663
01:00:49,886 --> 01:00:51,454
I'm disappointed.

664
01:00:52,989 --> 01:00:55,325
I brought you here
for one purpose.

665
01:00:56,159 --> 01:00:58,695
And you have failed me.

666
01:00:58,763 --> 01:01:01,331
You're as weak as your wife was.

667
01:01:01,965 --> 01:01:03,433
As your child.

668
01:01:04,835 --> 01:01:06,804
Yes, you fool.

669
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:09,973
It wasn't Sub-Zero at all.

670
01:01:10,673 --> 01:01:12,242
I killed them.

671
01:01:12,843 --> 01:01:14,377
<i>It was easy.</i>

672
01:01:14,444 --> 01:01:17,313
<i>I used sorcery
to hide my identity.</i>

673
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:20,683
<i>To make the Lin Kuei
do as I wanted.</i>

674
01:01:23,319 --> 01:01:25,989
You are strong, Scorpion.

675
01:01:26,757 --> 01:01:28,725
But not immortal.

676
01:01:28,793 --> 01:01:30,927
I think I'll leave you here.

677
01:01:30,994 --> 01:01:33,730
Just like I left your son.

678
01:01:33,798 --> 01:01:36,065
To be eaten by the birds.

679
01:01:42,672 --> 01:01:45,575
<i>Papa, the scorpion,
it needs help.</i>

680
01:01:45,642 --> 01:01:48,913
<i>Do you know why
the scorpion is feared?</i>

681
01:01:48,978 --> 01:01:50,713
<i>Its will.</i>

682
01:02:01,191 --> 01:02:03,259
Come on, Sonya, darling.

683
01:02:03,326 --> 01:02:04,994
Just a bit further.

684
01:02:05,695 --> 01:02:08,264
- Jax.
- Sonya?

685
01:02:08,331 --> 01:02:10,233
I'm so glad you made it.

686
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:11,534
It's gonna be a joy

687
01:02:11,601 --> 01:02:13,970
to watch you end up
like your partner.

688
01:02:21,177 --> 01:02:23,379
You think I'm afraid of you?

689
01:02:23,446 --> 01:02:24,446
Bring it on.

690
01:02:47,103 --> 01:02:48,238
Fuck.

691
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:51,140
Shang Tsung.

692
01:02:51,207 --> 01:02:53,510
Ah, I'm impressed, Raiden.

693
01:02:54,244 --> 01:02:55,813
You were right.

694
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,781
He has great spirit.

695
01:02:57,848 --> 01:03:00,049
And even greater skill.

696
01:03:00,116 --> 01:03:04,320
Please, we both know
yours is a lost cause.

697
01:03:04,955 --> 01:03:06,022
Goro!

698
01:03:16,967 --> 01:03:19,469
I'll make you a deal, Lui Kang.

699
01:03:19,536 --> 01:03:23,273
Yield, and Shao Kahn
will grant you mercy.

700
01:03:23,339 --> 01:03:25,208
You can come to Outworld.

701
01:03:25,275 --> 01:03:27,043
Live as a king.

702
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:29,813
We shall show you
every pleasure.

703
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:33,216
Is that how Shao Kahn
got you to betray your world?

704
01:03:33,283 --> 01:03:35,552
I am not as weak
as you, Shang Tsung.

705
01:03:36,386 --> 01:03:38,655
Then you shall die.

706
01:03:38,721 --> 01:03:39,722
Fight!

707
01:03:46,529 --> 01:03:48,832
Whoo! Oh.

708
01:04:00,143 --> 01:04:02,780
Poor Raiden.

709
01:04:02,846 --> 01:04:04,113
It must be awful

710
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:07,383
to watch your beloved
chosen one die,

711
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:10,888
and be unable
to do anything about it.

712
01:04:10,955 --> 01:04:13,189
The fight is not over yet.

713
01:04:13,256 --> 01:04:14,758
It may as well be.

714
01:04:14,825 --> 01:04:16,459
Quan Chi, goblets.

715
01:04:16,526 --> 01:04:20,030
Let us toast to our Emperor's
impending victory.

716
01:04:20,129 --> 01:04:21,765
Splendid idea.

717
01:04:30,607 --> 01:04:33,409
Now, Lui Kang,
you can do better than that.

718
01:04:35,678 --> 01:04:37,313
For Outworld.

719
01:04:37,881 --> 01:04:39,950
For Shao Kahn.

720
01:04:47,423 --> 01:04:51,294
Now, finish her!

721
01:04:58,568 --> 01:05:00,570
Here's Johnny.

722
01:05:01,905 --> 01:05:03,239
Argh!

723
01:05:05,642 --> 01:05:07,477
Johnny?

724
01:05:07,543 --> 01:05:09,679
Don't worry, babe. I got this.

725
01:05:14,952 --> 01:05:16,185
All right, boys.

726
01:05:16,252 --> 01:05:18,856
Picture's up, roll sound.

727
01:05:20,189 --> 01:05:22,158
And action!

728
01:05:37,007 --> 01:05:38,307
Impossible.

729
01:05:38,374 --> 01:05:40,144
Holy shit.

730
01:05:40,209 --> 01:05:42,780
Johnny Cage can fight.

731
01:05:42,846 --> 01:05:44,280
Save some for me.

732
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:49,519
I told you, you'd come around.

733
01:05:49,585 --> 01:05:51,387
Ugh...

734
01:05:52,522 --> 01:05:53,522
Ha!

735
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:58,294
Eat it.

736
01:06:32,395 --> 01:06:33,931
Well done.

737
01:06:33,997 --> 01:06:35,999
Truly, I underestimated you.

738
01:06:36,699 --> 01:06:37,901
But...

739
01:06:37,968 --> 01:06:39,803
I am bored now.

740
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:42,271
Goro, play time is over.

741
01:06:56,385 --> 01:06:58,554
Aah!

742
01:07:07,396 --> 01:07:08,766
Kano!

743
01:07:08,832 --> 01:07:09,867
Stay back!

744
01:07:09,933 --> 01:07:11,567
I'll slit his throat.

745
01:07:24,848 --> 01:07:26,083
Aah!

746
01:07:46,302 --> 01:07:47,470
Wait a minute.

747
01:07:52,876 --> 01:07:54,044
Now we can go.

748
01:07:56,747 --> 01:07:58,282
Aah!

749
01:08:11,995 --> 01:08:14,430
Yes. Yes.

750
01:08:14,497 --> 01:08:16,867
You see, Quan Chi,
the key to winning

751
01:08:16,934 --> 01:08:20,603
is always being a few steps
ahead of your enemies.

752
01:08:26,076 --> 01:08:27,244
Did you think I didn't know

753
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:29,512
you'd betray your Emperor,
Quan Chi?

754
01:08:29,579 --> 01:08:32,015
You're mistaken.
I would never...

755
01:08:36,552 --> 01:08:38,789
All for what?

756
01:08:38,856 --> 01:08:40,824
This?

757
01:08:40,891 --> 01:08:44,094
He's been imprisoned
for a reason, Quan Chi.

758
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:47,563
Your sad devotion
to the mad God Shinnok,

759
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:49,967
makes you as pathetic as he is.

760
01:08:50,033 --> 01:08:53,636
Soon, Earthrealm will be
Shao Kahn's,

761
01:08:53,703 --> 01:08:56,572
and his destiny
will be complete.

762
01:08:56,639 --> 01:08:59,943
It's too bad you won't live
long enough to see it.

763
01:09:01,111 --> 01:09:03,113
Finish him.

764
01:09:12,322 --> 01:09:14,557
Does it hurt?

765
01:09:24,835 --> 01:09:28,872
Soon, your weak species
will be no more.

766
01:09:48,926 --> 01:09:50,160
Who dares?

767
01:09:54,031 --> 01:09:55,031
Scorpion.

768
01:09:57,935 --> 01:09:59,202
Impossible.

769
01:09:59,269 --> 01:10:03,439
It would seem I underestimated
your champion, Quan Chi.

770
01:10:04,841 --> 01:10:07,677
You are Scorpion
of Netherrealm, yes?

771
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:11,580
You have killed Goro.

772
01:10:11,647 --> 01:10:14,318
Thus you must take
your rightful place

773
01:10:14,384 --> 01:10:16,053
as the champion of Outworld.

774
01:10:16,119 --> 01:10:19,423
I want nothing to do
with your game.

775
01:10:19,488 --> 01:10:21,691
I've come for him.

776
01:10:24,194 --> 01:10:25,561
Interesting.

777
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:27,998
Defeat Lui Kang,

778
01:10:28,065 --> 01:10:31,600
and you can have Quan Chi
to do with as you wish.

779
01:10:31,667 --> 01:10:33,337
Defeat Lui Kang,

780
01:10:33,403 --> 01:10:37,673
and my emperor will give you
all that you dream of.

781
01:10:38,674 --> 01:10:40,911
Vengeance is not the way,
Scorpion.

782
01:10:40,978 --> 01:10:42,412
Of course it is,

783
01:10:42,478 --> 01:10:43,780
and it's yours.

784
01:10:44,513 --> 01:10:46,116
All you have to do

785
01:10:47,017 --> 01:10:48,151
is kill him.

786
01:11:05,735 --> 01:11:07,037
Good.

787
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:09,172
Good.

788
01:11:09,239 --> 01:11:12,575
What choice did he
really have, Lord Raiden?

789
01:11:13,777 --> 01:11:16,179
There's always another choice.

790
01:11:22,551 --> 01:11:24,587
Now. Fight.

791
01:11:30,794 --> 01:11:33,797
What are you doing?

792
01:11:33,864 --> 01:11:36,133
Living for the future.

793
01:11:36,199 --> 01:11:38,601
Give me the key.

794
01:11:41,071 --> 01:11:42,239
You fool.

795
01:11:42,305 --> 01:11:44,107
Shao Kahn will hear about this

796
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:46,977
- and kill you.
- I'm already dead.

797
01:11:47,044 --> 01:11:48,378
Lui Kang.

798
01:11:48,445 --> 01:11:50,814
- I yield.
- No.

799
01:11:51,948 --> 01:11:54,084
Then the tournament is finished.

800
01:11:54,151 --> 01:11:55,852
Outworld has lost.

801
01:11:55,919 --> 01:11:58,288
Earthrealm is safe.

802
01:12:00,223 --> 01:12:02,893
I will kill you all.

803
01:12:02,959 --> 01:12:05,195
The tournament is over,
Shang Tsung.

804
01:12:05,262 --> 01:12:09,698
I am no longer bound
by rules of non-interference.

805
01:12:09,766 --> 01:12:12,202
Return to your Emperor.

806
01:12:12,269 --> 01:12:13,736
Tell him of your failure.

807
01:12:13,804 --> 01:12:16,773
You have made a mistake,
Lord Raiden.

808
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:20,510
Emperor Shao Kahn
will have his revenge.

809
01:12:20,576 --> 01:12:21,812
I'm counting on it.

810
01:12:23,046 --> 01:12:24,046
No.

811
01:12:26,615 --> 01:12:28,385
Without Shang Tsung's power,

812
01:12:28,452 --> 01:12:29,753
the island will collapse.

813
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:31,221
We must go.

814
01:12:32,688 --> 01:12:33,890
What about Scorpion?

815
01:12:33,957 --> 01:12:35,691
His path lies elsewhere.

816
01:12:35,759 --> 01:12:36,960
- But...
- Now.

817
01:12:39,463 --> 01:12:41,630
I knew you would survive.

818
01:12:41,697 --> 01:12:44,401
I chose you for a reason.

819
01:12:44,468 --> 01:12:46,002
Give me the key

820
01:12:46,069 --> 01:12:49,806
and we can leave this place
before it is destroyed.

821
01:12:49,873 --> 01:12:51,475
Come take it.

822
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:53,777
Like you did my family.

823
01:12:55,479 --> 01:12:58,081
Very well. But please,

824
01:12:58,148 --> 01:13:01,717
put up more of a fight
than your wife did.

825
01:13:22,873 --> 01:13:26,610
I'm going to finish the job
my demons couldn't.

826
01:13:26,675 --> 01:13:28,044
Die,

827
01:13:28,111 --> 01:13:30,679
you wretched vermin.

828
01:13:37,921 --> 01:13:41,057
It's time to die.

829
01:13:42,459 --> 01:13:44,528
Indeed.

830
01:14:01,677 --> 01:14:04,713
Lui, Lord Randy. Need a lift?

831
01:15:21,191 --> 01:15:23,360
Get over here.

832
01:15:28,565 --> 01:15:31,534
My God will avenge me.

833
01:15:32,469 --> 01:15:34,771
Damn your God.

834
01:16:14,477 --> 01:16:16,146
So, is that it?

835
01:16:16,212 --> 01:16:18,648
- Did we win?
- For now.

836
01:16:18,715 --> 01:16:20,884
All right! Yeah!

837
01:16:21,818 --> 01:16:23,586
Uh... May I?

838
01:16:27,157 --> 01:16:29,893
All right, yeah. Mmm.

839
01:16:29,959 --> 01:16:31,828
Hmm, cinnamon.

840
01:16:32,729 --> 01:16:34,064
Mmm, yeah, pat me there.

841
01:16:34,130 --> 01:16:35,766
Doesn't mean I'm gonna
break the hug.

842
01:16:35,832 --> 01:16:37,367
- That's enough.
- Okay.

843
01:16:38,668 --> 01:16:39,969
Think she'll ever like me?

844
01:16:40,036 --> 01:16:42,005
She didn't hit you in the nuts,
did she?

845
01:16:42,072 --> 01:16:45,275
Yes, she did, Jax.
Yes, she did.

846
01:16:46,643 --> 01:16:48,078
I have failed you.

847
01:16:48,144 --> 01:16:49,546
I could not defeat Goro.

848
01:16:50,647 --> 01:16:52,315
If it wasn't for Scorpion...

849
01:16:52,382 --> 01:16:54,217
Failed? No.

850
01:16:54,284 --> 01:16:58,722
Your destiny was never
to defeat Goro, Lui Kang.

851
01:16:58,789 --> 01:17:01,157
It was to defeat Shao Kahn.

852
01:17:03,761 --> 01:17:05,328
You have failed me.

853
01:17:05,962 --> 01:17:07,832
I'm sorry, Master.

854
01:17:07,897 --> 01:17:09,966
It was that old fool, Raiden.

855
01:17:10,033 --> 01:17:12,435
- He...
- Silence!

856
01:17:12,502 --> 01:17:14,337
Gather our forces.

857
01:17:14,404 --> 01:17:17,340
It's time to end this game...

858
01:17:18,141 --> 01:17:20,443
once and for all.

859
01:17:22,629 --> 01:17:27,629

1
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,833
<i>Mr. Spenser, are you prepared
to tell the court, in your own words,</i>

2
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,000
<i>what happened on the afternoon
of March 20th?</i>

3
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,916
<i>Yes, Your Honor.</i>

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,625
<i>Please proceed.</i>

5
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,416
<i>I had my partner drive me
to the home of Captain John Boylan.</i>

6
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,791
<i>Your commanding officer?</i>

7
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:48,541
<i>That's right.</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,184
<i>I had prior reason to believe</i>

9
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:51,892
<i>that Captain Boylan
was intentionally burying</i>

10
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,517
<i>the murder investigation
of Gloria Weisnewski...</i>

11
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,541
<i>Mr. Spenser,
please focus on the events that transpired</i>

12
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,745
<i>on the afternoon of March 20th.</i>

13
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,791
<i>I confronted
Captain Boylan in his home</i>

14
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:05,541
<i>and attempted to question him
about the investigation.</i>

15
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:08,708
The hell are you doing here?

16
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:10,916
<i>And the ensuing argument...</i>

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,601
Can't wait outside
the front door?

18
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:15,500
<i>I mean,
everybody knows what happened.</i>

19
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,166
Get out of our house!

20
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,375
Hey! Get out of here.
Get the fuck out of our house...

21
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:25,875
<i>At all times, I knew that these
actions were in violation of the law</i>

22
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:30,375
<i>and the code of conduct that I swore
to obey as a Boston police officer.</i>

23
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:33,166
<i>So, it is my understanding
that you are pleading guilty</i>

24
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,500
<i>to the charge of disturbing the peace?</i>

25
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:36,623
<i>Yes, Your Honor.</i>

26
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:40,208
<i>How do you plead on the count
of harassment in the first degree?</i>

27
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,892
- Get off him!
<i>- Guilty.</i>

28
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:45,791
<i>And how do you plead on the count
of aggravated assault of a police officer?</i>

29
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:46,750
<i>Guilty.</i>

30
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,333
<i>Before I sentence you,</i>

31
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:50,666
<i>is there anything further
that you would like to add?</i>

32
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,791
<i>Yes.
The son of a bitch deserved it.</i>

33
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,375
What do you say, Spense?

34
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,791
Hey, Squeeb.

35
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,958
Hey, new little fun fact for you.

36
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,208
You know, Saguaro cactus
lives for over 150 years?

37
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,601
Now, you cut one down in Arizona,

38
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,305
you can do a year in prison. Imagine that?

39
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,791
Shit.

40
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,625
I know guys that rob people in here

41
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,628
- doin' less time than that.
- Right?

42
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,125
How does it feel gettin' out?

43
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,708
I haven't slept in a few nights.
But other than that...

44
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,208
How you doin', Squeeb? How you feelin'?

45
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,791
I feel like a lifer.

46
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,958
You know, a lot of guys feel that way.

47
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,750
But you're different.

48
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,250
How many cops get to do
their time in gen pop?

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,250
Zero.

50
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,541
I can't think of one.

51
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:16,333
But, I mean, that's probably why
you're so popular in here.

52
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,250
I'm popular? Wow, I had no idea.

53
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,048
What're you gonna do
when you get out?

54
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,208
Back in the real world?

55
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,458
Yeah. Go to Fenway Park,

56
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,583
you know, get a big-ass, juicy rib eye.

57
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:30,916
You got a girl, right?

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,041
I got a girl. Her name is Pearl.

59
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,750
Yeah, I'm probably just gonna
lay down in my bed

60
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,083
and let her lick me all over.

61
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:41,708
Pearl. Sounds like an old lady's name, no?

62
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,666
You know, she's a little older.
She makes up for it in loyalty.

63

00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,583
Man. So, what's next?
That's the big question.

160
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,166
Look, I'm gettin outta here, you know?

161
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,730
There ain't shit for me here.
I'm gonna drive a semi, you know?

162
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,416
Look at sunsets. Shit like that.

163
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Ah, maybe it's for the best.

164
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,767
There's still a lot of cops around here
who'd love to put a mark on you.

165
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,208
Well, I get in a hassle,
I know who to call.

166
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,583
That's fuckin' right.

167
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,916
All right, man, welcome home, brother.

168
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,583
I love you. Nice to see you, brother.

169
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,166
How you doin' today, Mr. Cimoli?

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,083
I'm good.

171
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,250
- Say hi to Irene and the boys.
- You got it.

172
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,291
Let's go see your girlfriend.

173
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:45,958
Pearl.

174
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,333
Pearly, baby. Hey.

175
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,041
Pearly.

176
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,458
Henry, she won't even look at me.

177
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,684
She gave me the cold shoulder.

178
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:59,250
Baby, I'm sorry that I was gone.
I know five years is way too long.

179
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,791
Thirty-five years from her perspective.

180
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,250
No more cold winters for you.

181
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,684
You're gonna keep your
little paws in the desert,

182
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,291
you're gonna chase little
bunny rabbits in the sand. Huh?

183
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,250
There's no bunny rabbits in Arizona.

184
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,533
They got snakes and scorpions.
She wouldn't last a week.

185
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,333
You gotta shut the fuck up, okay?

186
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,916
I'm just tryin' to have a moment here

187
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,375
and apologize
for my absence to my baby girl.

188
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,708
We're gonna go to Arizona, all right?

189
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,583
I'm gonna drive a truck
and I'm never gonna let you go.

190
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,559
I'll have one hand on the wheel
and the other hand on you.

191
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,666
We'll put a little bed
right beside my chair.

192
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,541
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

193
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,625
Baby, you got the breath.

194
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:32,934
Didn't I tell you to buy the Greenies?

195
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,291
You didn't get her
the dog biscuits for her breath?

196
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,333
Uh, I'm going inside.

197
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,791
Hey, thank you
for my very own room.

198
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yo!

199
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,541
Henry!

200
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,791
- What?
- You said I had my own room.

201
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,458
Hawk, this is Spenser.
Spenser, this is Hawk.

202
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,458
You two are gonna be roommates.

203
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,125
Toilets are flushed at all times.

204
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,583
Food is labelled.

205
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:08,833
No fighting in the house

206
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:11,833
and if there's going to be
any drinking, I instigate it.

207
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,958
Now, I'd like you two
to get to know each other.

208
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:49,291
There's my girl.

209
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,250
Yes.

210
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:55,083
You love Daddy. You love Daddy, don't you?

211
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:01,416
Who's a big monster, huh? Who's a monster?

212
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,875
Ooh.

213
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,458
Give me my dog.

214
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,208
Give me the dog. Come on.

215
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,708
Come here, baby. Come here.

216
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:21,416
There. You're gonna stay here
with Daddy. Okay?

217
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,767
<i>Can you talk
to your daughter?</i>

218
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,017
Put her on and I'll talk to her.

219
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:28,875
<i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

220
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,166
Hey! Hey, sweetheart.

221
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,184
<i>Dad, I really need
your help with my report.</i>

222
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,809
I was straight A's in English.
I'll help you with the paper.

223
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,041
<i>That'd be awesome, Dad.
Are you gonna be home soon?</i>

224
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,458
When I get there, I'll read what you have
so far and we'll talk about it.

225
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,601
Oh, sweetheart,

226
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,416
hold on a second, I got another call.

227
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,036
<i>Boylan, are you there?</i>

228
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,458
I'm here, what's up?

229
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,541
<i>He wants to meet everyone
at the bus yard ASAP.</i>

230
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:53,166
- What the fuck is this all about?
<i>- Just be there.</i>

231
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,333
All right.

232
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:59,291
Sweetheart, yeah, listen,
I got a little bit of bad news.

233
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,875
- <i>Dad...</i>
- No, it's not... It's nothing.

234
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,666
I'm gonna be about 15, 20 minutes late.
I just got a call.

235
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,390
<i>You know this report's a big deal.</i>

236
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:08,726
<i>I need you to read it one more time.</i>

237
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,500
Listen, the thing about the book,

238
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:15,041
you've written all this beautiful stuff
about the darkness, about winter falling,

239
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,958
about the darkness inside the place,
the darkness in Zenobia's heart.

240
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,041
Just stay with that idea

241
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,845
- and take it all the way through.
<i>- Really?</i>

242
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,291
I think it's a beautiful idea.
I really do.

243
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,495
- I think you should have confidence.
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

244
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,916
Now, I read the first draft
and I gave you some notes.

245
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,360
But basically, what I'm tellin' you,
you turn that thing in,

246
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,125
you probably get an A on the first draft.

247
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,500
<i>But I know I'm not...</i>

248
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,041
<i>Dad, what happened? Dad?</i>

249
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,125
<i>Dad!</i>

250
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,041
<i>Dad, what was that?</i>

251
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,916
- Get the fuck off me! Get the fuck off!
<i>- Daddy!</i>

252
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,083
- You know who you're dealing with?
<i>- Daddy!</i>

253
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,916
You can't do this to a cop.

254
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,750
<i>- Dad!</i>
- I'm a fuckin' cop.

255
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,041
I'm a fuckin' cop.

256
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,091
You talked
to the wrong people, asshole.

257
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,041
I didn't give anything!

258
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,916
I swear to God I didn't give anything!

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,750
I didn't give a fuckin' thing.

260
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,625
I didn't give 'em anything. I swear.

261
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,333
Please, God.

262
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:04,916
<i>Good mornin', Boston.
Welcome to April 18th.</i>

263
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,083
<i>We're gonna have some picnic weather
today, can you believe that?</i>

264
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,500
<i>With highs in the upper sixties.</i>

265
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,250
<i>That's right, you heard me.</i>

266
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:16,875
<i>Upper sixties and zero chance
of rain, so pack up the kids,</i>

267
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,416
<i>pack up the sandwiches,</i>

268
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,000
<i>and pour yourself some luscious lemonade,</i>

269
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:24,000
<i>because it's spring time
in Boston, people.</i>

270
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,708
<i>And have yourself a wonderful day.</i>

271
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,250
<i>Next stop is Fifth Street,
in five minutes.</i>

272
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,291
What the hell?

273
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:11,791
Terry?

274
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,041
Terrence?

275
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,750
What happened to the...

276
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,625
Terrence!

277
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,791
Oh, my God!

278
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,250
Oh, my God, somebody help me.

279
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,416
Terrence!

280
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,541
Terry!

281
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:54,958
Are you fuckin' with me? Are you?

282
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,916
Hey. He snores.

283
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,041
What happened here?

284
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,166
Oh, a little going away present.

285
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,166
I got groceries for you.

286
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,666
Don't eat anything on the right side
of the fridge. It belongs to Hawk.

287
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,250
Aw, do you got any real food?

288
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,166
Frankfurters are mine.
The rest is his.

289
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,000
Where's the giant?

290
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,333
Gets up at five, starts running.

291
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,458
We got no milk.

292
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:29,791
There's some oatmeal milk in there,
but it belongs to Hawk.

293
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,583
Oat milk? What the fuck is that?

294
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,416
Who knows? All I know is
he drinks it all the time.

295
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,642
What? Do you have to put somethin' in it?

296
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:38,684
Well, what would you put in it?

297
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,268
I don't know, Henry. Take a wild guess.

298
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,958
Maybe water or milk or somethin'.

299
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,833
If you put milk in it,
you might as well use milk.

300
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:48,916
<i>It's been confirmed that the victim
is Boston Police Captain John Boylan.</i>

301
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,041
<i>Unofficial sources have described it
as an execution-style killing.</i>

302
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,208
<i>No arrests have been made.</i>

303
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,684
<i>- Back to you in the studio.</i>
- Holy shit.

304
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,017
<i>Thank you for that.
There is a city-wide manhunt...</i>

305
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,333
Jesus Christ. Somebody killed Boylan?

306
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,416
Was it you?

307
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,976
<i>Police are being tight-lipped
on the case so far,</i>

308
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
<i>but witnesses say
they saw a dark blue SUV...</i>

309
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,333
Son of a bitch,
they finally killed Boylan.

310
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,583
You wanna guess who that could be?

311
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,208
I can see 'em.

312
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,500
- That's pretty quick, huh?
- Yeah.

313
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:22,583
Wow.

314
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,625
Well, this is a surprise.

315
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,958
Yeah. Sorry, Spense, I gotta ask you.

316
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,708
Where were you last night?

317
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,208
You know how it is.

318
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,041
Captain Boylan dies
the same night that you get out.

319
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,708
You're on the top of the suspect list.

320
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,291
He was right here. I tucked him in myself.

321
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:55,166
Not only that, he's got a roommate
that was sleepin' ten feet away from him.

322
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,791
That's more like three feet,
Henry, but thank you very much.

323
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:01,416
All right.
An alibi's a beautiful thing. Let's go.

324
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,875
- That's it?
- Yep.

325
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,750
If it turns out I like you for this,

326
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,500
the DA will pop the old guy's story
like a balloon.

327
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,375
John Boylan was a good cop.

328
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,958
You should tell that to Mrs. Boylan.

329
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,809
At least with him dead,
she can stay out of the emergency room.

330
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,166
- Help me help you.
- You know what, big mouth?

331
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,333
I graduated the Academy
two years after you did.

332
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,041
And I work Homicide.

333
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,416
I wear a suit and carry a gold shield.

334
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Who the hell are you?

335
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,125
- Nothing.
- Okay, let's go.

336
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,750
An ex-con. I'm livin' your dream life,
you piece of shit.

337
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:36,833
Enough!

338
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:40,250
Man's got an alibi. Let's go.

339
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,250
Sorry, Spense. You're on the list.

340
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,833
This Boylan thing...
It's, uh... It's a problem.

341
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,250
It's a real problem.
You're lucky you're going to Arizona.

342
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,208
Wish I was goin' with you, man. Shit.

343
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,208
Say hi to that cactus for me.

344
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,916
Get in the car, man. It's over. Stop.

345
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:10,833
Shit.

346
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,333
Welcome home.

347
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,208
Come on, I'll make you somethin'.

348
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:32,375
<i>Police Chief John Boylan
was found dead early this morning,</i>

349
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:37,083
<i>in what sources are calling
"a gruesome execution-style murder."</i>

350
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:40,416
<i>Captain Boylan is a 22-year veteran
of the Boston PD.</i>

351
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,500
<i>This, from Boston Mayor
Marty Langs just moments ago.</i>

352
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:48,375
<i>When a police officer gets killed,
it's a death that hits us all.</i>

353
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:51,666
<i>It is the death of
a family member for all of us.</i>

354
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,541
<i>Today, every citizen of Boston
has lost a family member.</i>

355
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,833
<i>And we grieve together as a family.</i>

356
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,541
<i>We will heal...</i>

357
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,500
Hey! Wait! You!

358
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:48,541
What the hell's the matter with you?
Can't you read?

359
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:50,416
Oh, I'm sorry.

360
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,750
You here for the school?

361
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,541
I didn't see the sign there. Yeah.

362
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:55,500
Well, there's a sign.

363
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,642
- Can't you read? Get in.
- Okay. I'm sorry about that.

364
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:59,375
- Yeah.
- Beautiful truck.

365
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:01,458
She is. Her name is Black Betty.

366
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,892
First rule in this class
is to take everything you've learned

367
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,250
about being in a four-wheeler
and flush it down the toilet.

368
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:10,083
Your hands and feet are in charge
of 80,000 pounds of fast moving steel

369
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:13,375
and you must be the smartest person
on the road at all times.

370
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:16,125
You need to be awake,
you need to be alert and in charge.

371
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:19,458
You mess up, and a mini-van
with three sleeping kids,

372
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,250
and they get flattened like a pancake.

373
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,309
And nowadays, there are all
these cameras everywhere.

374
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,041
You're not gonna get away with it.

375
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,750
Now let's get to today's lesson, okay?

376
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:40,625
Any questions?

377
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:44,000
Any questions? Any questions?

378
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:54,041
- Hey, Spenser.
- Hey.

379
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:55,708
Cissy called a bunch of times.

380
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:57,583
- How many times?
- Like 22 times.

381
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:59,208
Twenty-three times.

382
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:00,708
I'm not here, okay?

383
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:01,875
He's not here.

384
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:04,833
Quit fuckin' around.
I want you to take a look at Hawk.

385
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:13,333
This kid is raw,
but I think he's got a lot of talent.

386
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:14,936
I think he could be somethin' special.

387
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:29,916
Time!

388
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,458
- You punch like a bitch.
- What the fuck?

389
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:36,708
- Hey! Time! Time!
- Say that fuckin' shit again!

390
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:41,041
Hey, hey! Break it up! Break it up!

391
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:42,875
Get him outta there!

392
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:47,833
Get him outta there!

393
00:24:47,916 --> 00:24:51,375
Get him the hell outta here! Out, out!

394
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,500
Get him out!

395
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:57,291
Get the fuck off me, man!

396
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:05,416
Hey. You're a fighter, all right?

397
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,041
You gotta be able to control yourself.

398
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:09,541
Henry, this guy doesn't
even know how to throw a punch.

399
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:11,142
You hear him?
Haven't I been tellin' you that?

400
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:13,166
That you don't know
how to throw a punch?

401
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,726
How about I kick you
in the fuckin'...

402
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:18,375
There'll be no kicking
till you learn how to punch.

403
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:21,416
He's gonna teach you.

404
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,226
- I'm not workin' with him.
- Yeah, you are.

405
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,767
- I'm not. No.
- You are.

406
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:26,226
- I want you to work with me.
- I'm not doing it.

407
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,170
- I'm asking you to do it.
- I don't give a shit.

408
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:30,166
One, two.

409
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,416
Hey, hey. Just punch, all right?

410
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,833
Keep your feet on the ground.

411
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:35,875
Throw a hook. Let me see a hook.

412
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:38,833
Uppercut.

413
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,083
Oh, my God.

414
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,833
All right, no, no.

415
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:46,333
Dude, stop, stop.

416
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:51,000
Hips. You gotta turn the hips,
all right? Turn the hips.

417
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,375
Boom. Turn, turn, turn.

418
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:55,458
- Turn. Turn.
- Like that?

419
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:58,208
Yeah. You don't need muscle
to knock somebody out.

420
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:02,291
Spenser.
Incoming. Incoming!

421
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:03,583
Where is he?

422

00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,333
Oh, shit.

424
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:14,250
I waited all this time.
I gotta come find you here?

425
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:15,684
Can we talk over here for a sec...

426
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:17,588
Just come and talk with me
for a second, please?

427
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:19,875
No. I'm gonna talk,
you are gonna listen.

428
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:22,184
- Don't keep backin' me up, okay? I...
- You don't like it?

429
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:24,500
- You don't like the way this feels?
- Cut the shit.

430
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,333
- You know what I think?
- What?

And you stopped coming to see me.

435
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,750
What's the problem?
I thought you moved on.

436
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:39,416
You were in prison!

437
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,583
- What was I supposed to do? Wait?
- Yeah.

438

439

441
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:48,500
No, I just figured you moved on.

442
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:51,291
What you're calling "move on"
is me just living.

443
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:53,250
I am a very successful...

- Look at me when I'm talking to you.

I'm a very successful
small business owner.

I got poodles comin' out of my ass.
Everybody wants to work...

Excuse me,
Miss Davis. Spenser's working.

449
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,166
Maybe you could talk to him later?

450
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,791
- What? Are you his bodyguard now?
- It's okay.

451
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:11,333
Look, look. Look at me.
Look at me. Listen, okay?

452
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:16,541
I'm sorry. All right? I am. I mean it.

453
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:21,000
You are incapable of real intimacy.

454
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:24,375
And I came here to tell you
I never wanna see you again.

455
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:30,666
Bye. All right.

This kid was a good kid, Henry. Clean.

468
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:17,875
I was in tactical training with him.

469
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:20,708
I've never seen somebody as happy as him.

470
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,500
Married, pregnant wife.

471
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:26,458
There's no way he's taking his own life.

472
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:31,916
<i>Graham worked in the narcotics
division with Captain John Boylan</i>

473
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,166
<i>who, just hours before,
was found dead in a South Boston bus yard.</i>

474
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,750
<i>Now,
police believe Terrence Graham</i>

475
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:42,458
<i>viciously murdered Captain Boylan
and are calling it a murder-suicide.</i>

476
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:43,708
That's dark.

477
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:44,666
<i>A murder this city</i>

478
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,291
<i>- is trying to come to grips with.</i>
- Wow. That's convenient.

479
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:49,767
Ah, what the hell difference does it make?

480
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:51,958
You're gonna be in Arizona,
drivin' a truck.

481
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:56,166
That's right, Henry.
It's none of my business.

482
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,083
<i>Officer Graham is survived
by his wife Letitia and their son Rowan.</i>

483
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:05,083
<i>What you're saying is not true!
Terrence was a good policeman!</i>

484
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:08,125
<i>Why doesn't anyone know
what's happening?</i>

485
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:10,250
<i>He was a good husband!
He was a good father!</i>

486
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,375
<i>What's going on?
Tell me what's really happening!</i>

487
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:13,750
Don't do it, Spense.

488
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:16,017
- <i>Don't tell me to calm down!</i>
- Let it go. Walk away.

489
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:19,708
<i>Why? Why? Why? Why?</i>

490
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:38,958
Mrs. Graham?

491
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,083
Mrs. Graham!

492
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:43,916
Hey. Sorry...
No, I didn't mean to scare you.

493
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,916
- What do you want?
- Sorry about that. I, uh...

494
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:47,791
Look...

495
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:51,125
I was, um... I was a friend of Terrence.

496
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,458
I just wanted to talk to you for a minute.

497
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:55,583
Who are you?

498
00:29:55,666 --> 00:29:58,541
Uh, my name is Spenser. I don't know
if Terrence told you about me.

499
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:02,250
Um, I got into a situation
years ago with John Boylan.

500
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,973
It sent me to prison for quite some time.

501
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:06,125
That was you?

502
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:09,833
Yeah. I just thought maybe
I could help you in some way.

503
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:11,875
Help, how?

504
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:15,375
Uh, I don't know, find the truth?

505
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:22,375
Did your husband
have any problems with Boylan?

506
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:28,416
Terry thought
Boylan was a loudmouth

507
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,125
whose ego could fill a room.

508
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:33,083
You know, old school,

509
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:35,708
above the law cop
who liked to flaunt his power.

510
00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:37,750
Yeah, that's Boylan to a T.

511
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:41,833
Boylan called Terrence
"altar boy."

512
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:46,041
Did Terrence have the technical knowledge
to disable the airbag in your vehicle?

513
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:47,500
Why?

514
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:50,875
Well, because you can't use a vehicle as
a ram unless you can disable the airbags.

515
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:54,166
Mmm-mmm. They didn't ask me that.
Why didn't they ask me that?

516
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,684
Because they already know the answer.

517
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:58,416
They found drugs in our home.

518
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,434
Mrs. Graham, we got a warrant.

519
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:03,333
<i>They said he was dirty.
Said he was dealing.</i>

520
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:05,101
<i>They knew right where
to look, didn't they?</i>

521
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:05,958
Check this wall.

522
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:07,351
<i>They went right up to it.</i>

523
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:08,208
Jackpot.

524
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:09,351
Look what we got here,
Mrs. Graham.

525
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:10,875
Your husband was dealing narcotics.

526
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:13,541
<i>And they said
they could pin me for conspiracy</i>

527
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:15,250
and take my boy away.

528
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,583
Well, believe them, okay?
They can and they will.

529
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:21,250
When is the last time
you saw your husband?

530
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:23,541
The night before?

531
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:25,791
Terrence said he had to meet his partner.

532
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:27,666
Um, Scott Traylor?

533
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:31,000
And they... They went to some cop bar.

534
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:32,083
Sláinte?

535
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:33,541
Yeah.

536
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,083
I know who Scott Traylor is.

537
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:37,416
I'll dig up anything I can,
see if it helps.

538
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:41,291
And this...

539
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:45,166
- This revenge for you?
- No.

540
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:48,083
My mom wasn't dealt a good hand either.

541
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:53,000
But she was fierce, tough,
and she had a lot of heart.

542
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:56,750
I got a lot of flaws, Mrs. Graham.
Believe me, a lot.

543
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,916
But anything I got good in me,
it came from her.

544
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:05,916
Sounds like she was a good woman.

545
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:11,291
Keep an eye on your son.
I'll be in touch, okay?

546
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,666
<i>♪ Sweet Caroline, pa, pa, pa ♪</i>

547
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,000
<i>♪ Good times never seemed so good ♪</i>

548
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:46,958
<i>♪ So good, so good ♪</i>

549
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:15,625
Hmm.

550
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:18,583
You Scotty Traylor?
Terrence Graham's partner?

551
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:22,500
Who are you?

552
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,875
I know Terrence didn't do
what they're pinning on him.

553
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:30,791
I'm gonna go take a piss. Come see me.

554
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:56,875
You know, it hit me who you are.

555
00:33:56,958 --> 00:34:00,000
A lot of guys in this bar,
they celebrated when you got locked up.

556
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,375
You and I both know
Terrence was not a crooked cop.

557
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:07,666
Was he in this bar
the night Boylan was killed, yes or no?

558
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:13,041
Yes.

559
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:16,291
And did he suspect Boylan
of bein' a dirty cop?

560
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Huh?

561
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:31,000
Unbelievable. How was Walpole?

562
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:33,142
Did you work your way right up
to the honeymoon suite?

563
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:35,083
Wow, Patrolman Macklin.

564
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:38,333
Hear how heavy you guys
are breathin' from walkin' 50 steps?

565
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:40,517
What the hell are you doin' here?

566
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:42,250
This isn't a bar for boy scouts.

567
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:45,541
Well, I said something
insensitive to this young man

568
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,833
who recently lost his partner

569
00:34:46,916 --> 00:34:49,458
and I think you guys just saved me
an ass kicking, so thank you.

570
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:52,416
He didn't do nothin'. He apologized.

571
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,333
Yeah? Did you apologize
for beatin' down your own captain?

572
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:58,125
I never got the chance.

573
00:34:58,208 --> 00:34:59,708
Jesus Christ.

574
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:01,791
The set of balls on you.

575
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:05,666
I don't know if you noticed it,
but it's Sergeant Macklin now.

576
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,625
Wow.
For you to be a sergeant,

577
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:11,083
I'd say all your superiors
must be dead, no?

578
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:13,208
That's impossible. So, what was it?

579
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:15,051
A clerical error
or they just get a tax break

580
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:17,333
hiring a mentally stunted
dickhead like yourself?

581
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:19,333
Jesus, you are a prick.

582
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:20,833
Thank you.

583
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:25,000
Aah! Bad mother...

584
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,958
Oh, that was good.

585
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,833
That was good. That was real good.

586
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:38,375
Come on already, will you?

587
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,110
We're gonna cut those out.

588
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:43,500
Give me that asshole.

589
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,666
Shit! Fuck.

590
00:35:58,125 --> 00:35:59,541
Hey, asshole.

591
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,833
Get the fuck out of Massachusetts.

592
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:04,500
You fuckin' hear me, Spenser? You're done.

593
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:28,708
See you later.

594
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,166
- I need to use your bathroom.
- Customers only.

595
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,916
Fine. Here.

596
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,041
Now it's official. Give me the key.

597
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:58,291
There. It's down the hall, to the right.

598
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:05,625
Bingo.

599
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:09,416
Dude, you can't be back here!
What are you doing?

600
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,916
I just need the tape from your cameras.
From the other day.

601
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,041
Oh, it's not a tape.

602
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:15,833
Well, I need this hard drive!

603
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:17,041
That's the cable box.

604
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:18,333
- What?
- That's the cable box.

605
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:19,416
Where's the hard drive?

606
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:20,934
How do you get the footage
from the cameras?

607
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:21,958
They're in the cloud.

608
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:24,666
What the fuck is a cloud?

609
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:28,166
- The cloud. Yeah...
- Listen, dude...

610
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:32,166
Don't play with me right now.
Give me the cloud.

611
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:39,208
Ooh, I thought you knew how to punch.

612
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:42,166
- There was four of them. Okay?
- You good?

613
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,625
Oh, no, no. I'm not good.

614
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:45,101
I don't know how to work
this computer shit.

615
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:46,125
Sit down, will you?

616
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:47,791
Come on, please.

617
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:52,458
Thank you.

618
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:54,625
Let me look at the top right camera.

619
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:58,625
That's Terrence Graham's car.
It was used in the Boylan hit.

620
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:01,250
Let's see what happens when he comes out.

621
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:05,250
There he is.

622
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:12,375
All right, hold on.

623
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,250
Who are you meeting, Terrence?

624
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:16,875
That's a Corvette Z06.

625
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:19,018
Can you zoom in a little bit?

626
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:22,375
It's too blurry. Shit!

627
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:25,017
It means you're looking
for a fat, old, white dude

628
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:27,041
with three divorces and a micro-dick.

629
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:27,958
Why's that?

630
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:29,881
Who else you think drives
a Corvette like that?

631
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:34,250
Go back to the other camera.
Now, fast forward.

632
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:40,833
Wait, wait, wait. Zoom in a little more.

633
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:46,750
Let me see.

634
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:51,958
So, they all left together.

635
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:59,291
You got any idea
who those guys are?

636
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:02,250
I don't know,
but I know where they went.

637
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:05,416
One, two, uppercut.
One, two! One, two!

638
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,000
Come on! Stick and move.
Stick and move. Stick and move.

639
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:10,250
One, two, one, two.

640
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:15,208
That's it. Move, move it.
That's it. Come on.

641
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:17,875
Punch it.

642
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,500
Time.

643
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:23,221
Hey, he keeps dropping
that right hand after he throws it.

644
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,083
Spenser!
What the hell are you doing here?

645
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:28,208
You thinkin' of leavin' Cimoli's?

646
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:31,375
No, look, I wanted to ask you
a few questions about Terrence Graham.

647
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,833
Man, anything seem off to you about it?

648
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:38,541
Yeah. The fact that
you're askin' me about it.

649
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:40,916
What are you,
a private detective now, huh?

650
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,500
Is that what's goin' on here?

651
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,333
'Cause I was under the impression that

652
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:46,500
a convicted felon can't get a license.

653
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:48,833
With your connections,
I could probably get a pardon.

654
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:54,500
Listen, let this one go.

655
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:56,916
Graham's dirty, drugs in his house.

656
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,541
Look, they said that Boylan
was killed in the school bus yard, right?

657
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:02,958
And that Terrence Graham
rammed him first with his SUV?

658
00:42:03,041 --> 00:42:04,267
That's how he got the drop on him.

659
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:06,916
Yeah, but they found his SUV
outside of his house.

660
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:10,601
Then he drove himself home
and blew his brains out.

661
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:11,934
You don't have
to be Sherlock Holmes here...

662
00:42:11,958 --> 00:42:13,309
No, the air bags should've went off.

663
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:15,166
He wouldn't have been
able to drive it at all.

664
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:17,541
Well, he must've disabled 'em.

665
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:21,500
Yeah, but it doesn't add up.
Why drive all the way home?

666
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:23,083
To shoot himself?

667
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:26,208
Run the risk of his kid walkin' out
and seein' him dead in the car?

668
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:29,125
Spenser, the man was not
in his right mind.

669
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:30,833
And what about the crime scene?

670
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:32,333
Everything added up, right?

671
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:34,750
Beats me. I haven't been there.

672
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:43,958
You haven't been there?

673
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:45,142
What do you mean you haven't been there?

674
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:46,333
No, I haven't been there.

675
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:48,376
Spenser, why would I go there?
The case is closed.

676
00:42:49,416 --> 00:42:52,833
You're home, baby.
Let it go. Let it go, man.

677
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:56,000
The only thing that it's gonna bring you
is grief, pain, frustration.

678
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:57,125
Let it go.

679
00:42:58,416 --> 00:43:00,625
I gotta get back to work,
I ain't gettin' no younger.

680
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:03,541
All right. He's right,
I'm keepin' my right hand too low.

681
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:05,750
One, two! One, two!

682
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,291
<i>Investigation
into the brutal double homicide</i>

683
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:12,333
<i>that has rocked the city
of Boston continues today.</i>

684
00:43:12,416 --> 00:43:14,791
<i>We're hearing inside
the Boston Police Department,</i>

685
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:17,416
<i>that Officer Terrence Graham
lured Captain Boylan</i>

686
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:21,541
<i>to an isolated city school bus yard
where he killed him violently.</i>

687
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:24,416
<i>It is believed Terrence Graham
is the only suspect.</i>

688
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,892
Block, block, block, block...

689
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:28,958
Oh, you see that? You gotta be
able to move, all right?

690
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:31,416
Defense is the best offense sometimes. Go.

691
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,291
That's pretty perfect.

692
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,958
Do I get a shot
at drivin' the Black Betty?

693
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:43,416
You're not ready, Mr. Spenser.

694
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:46,500
Well, uh, she sure is a pretty truck.

695
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:48,383
There you go.

696
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,250
Yeah. Okay. Get in.

697
00:43:53,083 --> 00:43:54,750
Now, block. Good.

698
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:56,309
And block, block, block.

699
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,333
- Oh, you see that?
- Yeah.

700
00:43:58,416 --> 00:44:00,291
You have to listen. All right? Yeah.

701
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:02,583
<i>City officials

702

703

<i>and will announce details shortly.</i>

704
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:09,375
Good job.

705
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:12,911
I'm gonna go get somethin' to eat.
You want somethin'?

706
00:44:17,916 --> 00:44:19,625
- Thank you.
- For what?

707
00:44:19,708 --> 00:44:21,833
The boxing. You're right, I need it.

708
00:44:21,916 --> 00:44:23,666
I'm just doin' what Henry asked me to do.

709
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,875
Got one Green Goddess for the gentleman.

710
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:29,708
Gonna like this a lot more than
prison food, I guarantee you.

711
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:32,208
I don't know about that.
What'd you go up for?

712
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:34,666
Manslaughter.

713
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:38,000
Reduced from murder one.

714
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:40,250
Served four years, out on good behavior.

715
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:44,291
And now, thanks to Henry,
I'm changin' my life.

716
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:46,291
Oh, God.

717
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:49,083
I wanna be the LeBron James of MMA.

718
00:44:49,166 --> 00:44:50,500
- Really?
- Yeah.

719
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:52,083
Wow. Yeah, that's impressive.

720
00:44:52,166 --> 00:44:54,142
I'm gonna use my gifts to make
a difference in the world

721
00:44:54,166 --> 00:44:55,226
like my dad would've wanted.

722
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,458
Your dad, huh?

723
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:58,416
What was he like?

724
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:02,125
He was a good guy. Military man, pilot.

725
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:04,416
Man of the world type, you know?

726
00:45:05,291 --> 00:45:08,500
We moved around a lot.
Settled in New Orleans.

727
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:13,625
He witnessed some real
messed up shit in our community.

728
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:15,791
Everybody told him to look the other way.

729
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:17,750
He couldn't.

730
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,541
He died, a hero.

731
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:24,333
Not minding his own business.

732
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:28,666
And what happened?

733
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,351
I'm not gonna get into that, not with you.

734
00:45:30,375 --> 00:45:33,250
- Probably not ever, actually.
- Fair enough.

735
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,750
I'm gonna go wash my hands.

736
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:38,184
It's fine. Whatever you want.

737
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:39,666
Yeah, chill out. Relax.

738
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:46,000
Hey, what are you doin'?

739
00:45:48,791 --> 00:45:50,000
You followin' me?

740
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,166
Uh, I came to the bathroom first.

741
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,083
You followed me in here.
So, you're following me.

742
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:57,851
What are you doin' in this restaurant?

743
00:45:57,875 --> 00:45:58,916
I came to meet a friend.

744
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,708
- What are you doin'?
- Hmm.

745
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:03,291
- Don't be ridiculous, okay?
- Don't be ridiculous.

746
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:05,125
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

747
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:06,833
- Don't! You know what? You...
- What?

748
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:08,375
We're not doing...

749
00:46:08,458 --> 00:46:09,934
- We're not doing this today.
- We're not doin' what?

750
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:10,875
Oh, we're just gonna go.

751
00:46:10,958 --> 00:46:12,226
You're the one putting your hands on me.

752
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:14,184
- I'm just guiding you back to the door...
- Guiding me?

753
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:15,601
- Where do you wanna guide me?
- You're blocking my path.

754
00:46:15,625 --> 00:46:16,458
- You locked the door.
- Where do you wanna guide me?

755
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:18,351
- Stop that.
- You're the one pushin' me.

756
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,291
What are you, the lock police?

757
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:22,017
All right, you look good.
What do you want from me?

758
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:25,208
I want a lot from you,
'cause guess what? You look good, too.

759
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,833
No, you look really good.

760
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:28,642
Yeah? So why don't you
do somethin' about it?

761
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:30,375
How about this?
Huh? You like this?

762
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:31,767
- Don't touch my fuckin' hair.
- All right.

763
00:46:31,791 --> 00:46:33,111
You know how I get about my hair.

764
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:35,500
- I know what you like. Come here.
- You wanna show me?

765
00:46:35,583 --> 00:46:37,392
- Yes? All right.
- Yeah. All right. I got you.

766
00:46:37,416 --> 00:46:39,125
Stop, stop.

767
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:44,958
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

768
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,708
- Like that?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

769
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:52,375
Oh, shit! Okay! Okay! Okay!

770
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:54,708
Don't you dare! Don't you dare!

771
00:46:54,791 --> 00:46:57,625
Don't you dare
fuckin' cum before me. Okay?

772
00:46:57,708 --> 00:46:59,291
Fuck yeah.

773
00:46:59,375 --> 00:47:01,583
Cissy always finishes first!

774
00:47:01,666 --> 00:47:03,916
Fuck me harder!

775
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,125
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Was that it?

776
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:07,291
Go, Sox!

777
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:10,125
Don't stop! Don't stop!

778
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:12,000
- Don't stop!
- Oh, shit!

779
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:14,041
- Oh, my fuckin' God!
- Shut up!

780
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:16,250
Oh, my fuckin' God!

781
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,041
We're in the window right now, Spenser.

782
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:28,958
- What's that?
- Remember the window?

783
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:31,593
You mean the five minutes
of peace between us

784
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:33,583
right after we have sex? Yeah.

785
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:35,375
Yeah, lasts about as long as sex with you.

786
00:47:35,458 --> 00:47:36,500
- Get off me.
- Yeah.

787
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:40,333
Used to be my favorite part of the day.

788
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:42,250
Even better than fuckin'.

789
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:44,601
Well, you seem like you liked it.

790
00:47:44,625 --> 00:47:46,791
What, you wanna go again?

791
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:54,500
That time we thought I was pregnant.

792
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:58,708
- Do you remember what you said to me?
- Um, I remember the gist.

793
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:00,750
You said,

794
00:48:01,666 --> 00:48:03,375
"I'm not sayin' we're gettin' married,

795
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,375
but that kid's not gonna
be raised without a father."

796
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:08,541
You remember that?

797
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:10,750
It was a false alarm, thank God.

798
00:48:11,916 --> 00:48:13,708
But you were gonna do what was right.

799
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:17,875
You always had that strong moral code.

800
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:23,333
I'm movin' to Arizona.

801
00:48:24,291 --> 00:48:26,625
I'm gonna start over. Start fresh.

802
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:30,958
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

803
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:32,250
This is your home.

804
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:38,333
Hell will freeze over
before you ever touch me again.

805
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:44,500
You got, um... You got a little
stain on your dress there.

806
00:48:44,583 --> 00:48:45,833
Just sayin'.

807
00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:46,916
Souvenir.

808
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:53,291
Fuckin'...

809
00:49:14,708 --> 00:49:17,750
- You enjoy yourself in there?
- Mind your business.

810
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:20,041
Okay. I'll mind my business.

811
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:22,333
Is that yellow Corvette my business?

812
00:49:24,375 --> 00:49:25,541
Shit!

813
00:49:51,541 --> 00:49:52,875
Whoa!

814
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:56,875
No, I'm just cutting through.

815
00:49:56,958 --> 00:49:59,625
No, no! Stay! Stop!

816
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,791
Oh, shit!

817
00:50:07,916 --> 00:50:09,291
Fuck!

818
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:11,958
Oh, God! Get the fuck...

819
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:23,750
Fuck off! God!

820
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:25,458
Oh, my God!

821
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,750
You fuckin' motherfucker...

822
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:48,791
What?

823
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:57,416
Oh, shit! Fuck!

824
00:50:59,416 --> 00:51:00,791
Fuck!

825
00:51:00,875 --> 00:51:02,833
Hey! What are you doing to my dog?

826
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:05,416
Get off my dog!

827
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,125
Lego. Come here, Lego.

828
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:10,166
- Good girl. Oh...
- Fuck!

829
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:12,750
Come here. Good girl.

830
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:14,833
Good girl. Aw.

Huh?

849
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:30,041

You couldn't have yelled that to me

855
00:52:52,541 --> 00:52:54,458
and prevented me
from gettin' mauled by a wolf?

of DUIs off my record, please?

- Aw, hey, Billy.

I need my registered

I gave you $500 under the table

- Fine. Enough.

874

I have the money you requested

875

Give me the plate.

Tracksuit Charlie Bentwood.

888
00:54:27,166 --> 00:54:28,458
Irish mob throwback.

889
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:31,666
Back when the Irish mob existed
outside all those shitty movies.

890
00:54:32,708 --> 00:54:33,708
There we go.

891
00:54:39,416 --> 00:54:40,416
Nice.

892
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:45,708
I think it's time you tell me
what's really goin' on here.

893
00:54:46,375 --> 00:54:50,083
There was a girl named Gloria Weisnewski.

894
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:53,083
I used to shovel snow off
her mother's porch in Southie.

895
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,250
She was a smart kid.
I watched her grow up.

896
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:58,083
When developers came to Southie,

897
00:54:58,166 --> 00:55:01,291
gentrifying and trying to destroy
the soul of the city,

898
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,601
<i>she couldn't look the other way.</i>

899
00:55:02,625 --> 00:55:04,625
We can keep on marching!

900
00:55:07,916 --> 00:55:09,833
Where does Tracksuit Charlie come in?

901
00:55:10,458 --> 00:55:12,625
Tracksuit Charlie was
and is a goon for hire.

902
00:55:12,708 --> 00:55:15,625
<i>Somebody paid him to harass Gloria,
get her to give up.</i>

903
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:18,041
You shut your mouth!

904
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:21,125
Get your filthy,
stinkin' hands out my face!

905
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:23,250
Shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you!

906
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:24,333
Then it escalated.

907
00:55:25,833 --> 00:55:30,125
<i>Phone calls, threats, harassment.</i>

908
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:35,976
<i>Next thing you know, Gloria comes home
and finds her cat nailed to the door.</i>

909
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:39,281
It didn't take a genius to know

910
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:41,493
<i>that it was Tracksuit Charlie
that killed Gloria's cat.</i>

911
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:45,541
Couple of weeks later,
I was out on a call.

912
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:47,000
Manager at Cumberland Farms

913
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:50,375
<i>had a suspicious vehicle
in the parking lot.</i>

914
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:55,041
There was blood leaking from the trunk.

915
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:17,250
We got a...

916
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:18,416
<i>I had to tell her mother.</i>

917
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:22,250
<i>It was almost worse than finding the body.</i>

918
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:24,291
I got you.

919
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:32,250
I don't know,
I was so close to the family.

920
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:34,750
They were good, honest people,
so I just kept checkin' in.

921
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:36,708
Got handed over to Homicide.

922
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:39,166
But I couldn't let it go.

923
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,434
<i>When I followed up on Gloria's case,</i>

924
00:56:42,458 --> 00:56:44,666
<i>I found out Homicide
was just sittin' on it.</i>

925
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:47,000
<i>They hadn't even questioned
Tracksuit Charlie.</i>

926
00:56:48,041 --> 00:56:49,976
- Lieutenant.
- Sergeant, what are you doing here?

927
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,059
I need to speak with you
outside for a minute.

928
00:56:51,083 --> 00:56:52,458
We're in the middle of somethin'.

929
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:53,375
This is very important.

930
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:55,559
It's in your best interest
that you step outside and talk to me.

931
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:57,958
I will actually judge
what's in my best interest

932
00:56:58,041 --> 00:57:00,101
and you need to start thinking
about what's your best interest.

933
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,101
Sergeant, get your ass outta here.
You get out of here now.

934
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:03,226
We're in the middle of something.

935
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:06,250
Are you in the middle of
investigating Gloria Weisnewski's murder?

936
00:57:06,291 --> 00:57:08,791
'Cause you should be,
but you're burying it. Why?

937
00:57:09,958 --> 00:57:13,083
I think you should step outside
and mind your step, son.

938
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:14,875
- Really?
- Yeah, you really do.

939
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:16,583
Listen...

940
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:18,750
Don't touch me. Don't touch me, okay?

941
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:19,953
- Wake up!
- Get out of here.

942
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,476
- Get him outta here!
- Let's go.

943
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,875
<i>I should've walked away,
but I knew he was covering something up.</i>

944
00:57:24,958 --> 00:57:26,416
Get out, you piece of shit.

945
00:57:30,958 --> 00:57:33,478
And then I get a call
from this reporter at the <i>Globe,</i>

946
00:57:33,541 --> 00:57:35,833
<i>and he wants to show me
this very graphic tape.</i>

947
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:39,458
Has Homicide seen this tape?

948
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:41,541
Yeah, a secretary leaked it to me.

949
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,708
It's Gloria Weisnewski.

950
00:57:43,791 --> 00:57:46,833
Word is, those animals were part
of the Trinitario drug gang.

951
00:57:47,541 --> 00:57:50,291
They haven't even questioned
the guys workin' the lot yet.

952
00:57:50,958 --> 00:57:53,416
- What?
- You wanna hear the extent of the sandbag?

953
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,767
<i>Globe's</i> not gonna run it.
They're putting me on another story.

954
00:57:55,791 --> 00:57:58,311
- So what're they hiding?
- I was hoping you could tell me that.

955
00:57:58,375 --> 00:57:59,833
This is fucked up, man.

956
00:57:59,916 --> 00:58:01,958
Tracksuit must have put them on it.

957
00:58:11,541 --> 00:58:12,666
Fuckin' Boylan.

958
00:58:17,916 --> 00:58:19,416
Hey, one flash behind.

959
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,125
One flash behind you, baby.

960
00:58:42,541 --> 00:58:44,125
What are you doing here?

961
00:58:44,208 --> 00:58:45,726
I have some urgent questions
for you, John.

962
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:47,833
Jesus. Just walk right in. What questions?

963
00:58:47,916 --> 00:58:49,309
Know Wayne Cosgrove,
reporter for the Globe?

964
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:50,500
No, I don't know who that is.

965
00:58:50,583 --> 00:58:51,916
He showed me the tape.

966
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,517
- What tape?
- The tape of Gloria Weisnewski

967
00:58:53,541 --> 00:58:54,809
being murdered in the parking lot.

968
00:58:54,833 --> 00:58:55,976
The tape that you are burying.

969
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,434
What tape? I don't know
what you're talking about.

970
00:58:57,458 --> 00:58:59,267
- Don't play stupid with me.
- I'm not playing stupid.

971
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:01,017
- Not in your own home.
- Don't talk to me like that in my house!

972
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:02,642
- Are you drunk right now?
- It doesn't matter.

973
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:04,458
It's eight o'clock on a Saturday morning.

974
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:05,750
Move along.

975
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:08,125
Get the fuck out of our house!

976
00:59:08,208 --> 00:59:09,808
What happened to your wife's face, John?

977
00:59:09,875 --> 00:59:10,791
That is just... no way...

978
00:59:10,875 --> 00:59:12,226
What? Did you hit her with that...

979
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:13,708
You're a filthy cop.

980
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:16,541
You're a fuckin' disgrace.
You beat that...

981
00:59:16,625 --> 00:59:18,333
Fuckin' hell!

982
00:59:18,416 --> 00:59:19,666
Shit.

983
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,666
Get off of him!

984
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:26,708
Get off of him, you son of a bitch.

985
00:59:27,791 --> 00:59:30,750
Spense! Stop!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

986
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:35,583
Get off of him!

987
00:59:35,666 --> 00:59:37,083
Get off of him!

988
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,750
That fucker over there killed a cat?

989
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:52,916
So, the cat is what you're
takin' away from all of this?

990
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,434
Here's what we're gonna do.

991
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:57,541
We're gonna blow this whole shit open.

992
00:59:57,625 --> 00:59:59,666

Hey, you guys.

1039
01:03:22,791 --> 01:03:24,500
You looking
for something, Officer?

1040
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:27,916
No, former officer.
I'm just a concerned citizen now.

1041
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,750
Doing a little private investigating?

1042
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:32,713
I haven't really come up
with the title yet for what I'm doing.

1043
01:03:33,791 --> 01:03:36,333
Let me know if you hear anything
germane to my investigation.

1044
01:03:36,416 --> 01:03:39,041
What investigation is that,
uh, Agent Louisa Burton?

1045
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:40,208
Use your imagination.

1046
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:43,625
You're the guy that got arrested
for assaulting John Boylan.

1047
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:44,833
That's who you are.

1048
01:03:44,916 --> 01:03:46,184
Gosh, damn it, that's who he is.

1049
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:50,833
Wow. Your partner's wound
a little tight, huh?

1050
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:55,041
You know, no offense, but two
top-dollar Feds tailing a dirty cop?

1051
01:03:55,125 --> 01:03:59,166
I mean, what did you two do
to fuckin' deserve this shit detail?

1052
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:01,125
See you later, all right?

1053
01:04:11,541 --> 01:04:14,302
<i>It's simple. The FBI
does not solve crime, they manage them.</i>

1054
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:16,250
<i>They play some big abstract game,</i>

1055
01:04:16,333 --> 01:04:18,666
<i>trying to trade-up
for some vague masterplan,</i>

1056
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:20,041
<i>a big fish, which they never do.</i>

1057
01:04:20,125 --> 01:04:22,083
<i>Meanwhile, all the victims, the innocents,</i>

1058
01:04:22,166 --> 01:04:23,934
- the Terrence Grahams of the world...
- Hmm.

1059
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:25,309
...they fall through the cracks. Right?

1060
01:04:25,333 --> 01:04:26,458
There's zero justice, ever.

1061
01:04:26,541 --> 01:04:27,875
So, where are we?

1062
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:30,625
We got Trinitarios, deal makin' FBI.

1063
01:04:31,666 --> 01:04:32,541
Yeah.

1064
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:35,000
And we got some
very corrupt cops covering something up.

1065
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:38,833
Well, maybe killing Boylan was a message.

1066
01:04:43,291 --> 01:04:44,916
I know who we gotta go see.

1067
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:08,166
What the fuck do you want?

1068
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:10,333
You know that hit you tried on me?

1069
01:05:11,583 --> 01:05:13,416
Who wanted that?

1070
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,833
Why is the FBI tailing dirty cops?

1071
01:05:15,916 --> 01:05:17,416
What's going on in the city?

1072
01:05:18,458 --> 01:05:20,250
I don't have anything to say to you.

1073
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:23,583
I figured you'd say that.

1074
01:05:24,083 --> 01:05:25,163
Do you like movies, Squeeb?

1075
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:29,458
I got friends in here.
I was able to bring in my phone.

1076
01:05:30,291 --> 01:05:31,291
Henry, we're live.

1077
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:33,791
<i>I... Let me...
I don't know if I have this right.</i>

1078
01:05:34,375 --> 01:05:35,291
The fuck is that?

1079
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:38,351
- <i>For Christ's sake. I got it...</i>
- Move your face away from the camera.

1080
01:05:38,375 --> 01:05:39,375
- Yeah. Henry.
<i>- What?</i>

1081
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:42,083
Move your face away from the camera.

1082
01:05:43,208 --> 01:05:45,416
<i>- You got video?</i>
- Yes.

1083
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:46,791
<i>Are we really doing this?</i>

1084
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:48,583
Yes. Now.

1085
01:05:53,541 --> 01:05:54,708
Recognize her?

1086
01:05:57,916 --> 01:05:59,250
Hey, is that my wife?

1087
01:05:59,333 --> 01:06:00,708
It ain't mine.

1088
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:01,875
Hey, what the fuck?

1089
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,250
How long has it been, huh?
How long you been in here?

1090
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,990
How long has it been
since she's had some real attention?

1091
01:06:09,041 --> 01:06:10,561
You see that handsome gentleman there?

1092
01:06:11,041 --> 01:06:12,666
He met her in a supermarket.

1093
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:14,892
He asked her if she wanted
to have a drink, she said yes.

1094
01:06:14,916 --> 01:06:16,059
- Look how she's dressed.
- Fuck you!

1095
01:06:16,083 --> 01:06:17,683
No, look how she's dressed up.

1096
01:06:17,708 --> 01:06:21,333
Three in the afternoon,
she's dressed up like that? Wow.

1097
01:06:21,416 --> 01:06:23,476
And you know what she had to do?
She had to get a babysitter.

1098
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,291
That's a weird time
to get a babysitter, huh?

1099
01:06:25,375 --> 01:06:27,455
What are all the Aryan brothers
gonna say about that?

1100
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:33,916
You better hurry up, Squeeb.
She's already had four drinks.

1101
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,166
Fuck you. What the fuck do you want?

1102
01:06:37,291 --> 01:06:38,916
I want answers, okay?

1103
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:44,375
Tell your friend to leave Suzie alone.

1104
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:50,208
Henry, tell Hawk to walk away.

1105
01:06:50,291 --> 01:06:53,166
<i>Okay, got it.
Hey, Romeo, get outta there.</i>

1106
01:06:57,625 --> 01:06:58,791
What do you want?

1107
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:02,625
I know you know things, Squeeb.
You got ears on the street.

1108
01:07:03,708 --> 01:07:06,833
What happened to Boylan? Hmm?

1109
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:10,041
Who ordered the hit on me on my last day?

1110
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:15,500
I'll give you one word, man,
one word only.

1111
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,833
Well, it better be a good word, <i>amigo.</i>

1112
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:25,041
Wonderland.

1113
01:07:29,125 --> 01:07:30,875
What, you mean the dog track?

1114
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:35,708
What are you smiling at, Squeeb?

1115
01:07:36,291 --> 01:07:39,208
I just keep imagining your head
rolling down the sidewalk.

1116
01:07:39,958 --> 01:07:42,208
You're fuckin' dead.

1117
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:50,625
Cosgrove, you in there?

1118
01:07:50,708 --> 01:07:51,958
Who's there?

1119
01:07:52,583 --> 01:07:53,625
Come on out.

1120
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:55,625
Where are you?

1121
01:07:56,291 --> 01:07:57,625
Wonderland.

1122
01:07:57,708 --> 01:07:59,458
They're building a casino there.

1123
01:07:59,541 --> 01:08:02,166
It's gonna have the GNP
of a small oil-rich nation.

1124
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:04,500
- <i>And it's corrupt?
- Well, yeah.</i>

1125
01:08:04,583 --> 01:08:06,726
<i>I mean, ever heard of
an honest outfit running a casino?</i>

1126
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:09,833
<i>I mean, they are, by design,
instruments of corruption.</i>

1127
01:08:10,916 --> 01:08:14,833
If I was still a crime reporter
and I wanted to get my head chopped off,

1128
01:08:14,916 --> 01:08:17,791
<i>I'd be writing about
the connection between some dirty cops</i>

1129
01:08:17,875 --> 01:08:20,458
<i>and some big politicians
using the Trinitario drug trade</i>

1130
01:08:20,541 --> 01:08:22,750
<i>to get a seat at the table of Wonderland.</i>

1131
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:26,083
It's like some fuckin' evil partnership.

1132
01:08:26,166 --> 01:08:27,083
It's got a name.

1133
01:08:27,166 --> 01:08:30,708
Los Oscuros. Huh? The Dark.

1134
01:08:30,791 --> 01:08:32,125
Cosgrove, if you know all this,

1135
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:34,088
why don't you just go public
with what you have?

1136
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:38,250
Because the Wonderland syndicate
has got enough money

1137
01:08:38,333 --> 01:08:40,250
<i>to bury anything I put out there.</i>

1138
01:08:42,166 --> 01:08:43,625
<i>All right, picture this.</i>

1139
01:08:43,708 --> 01:08:46,833
<i>Real bad cops, Dominican street gangs,</i>

1140
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:49,375
<i>and some of the dirtiest
investors in the game,</i>

1141
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,208
<i>all working together</i>

1142
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:54,041
<i>to build the next
great family-friendly resort destination</i>

1143
01:08:54,125 --> 01:08:55,625
<i>for degenerate gamblers.</i>

1144
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,500
<i>What if I get you evidence?</i>

1145
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:06,500
What? Real, undeniable evidence?

1146
01:09:06,583 --> 01:09:08,541
I don't even know what that looks like.

1147
01:09:08,625 --> 01:09:12,625
It would have to be some fuckin' visual
to poke through this fake news bullshit.

1148
01:09:12,708 --> 01:09:16,458
I'll tell you that. Okay? So, we done now?

1149
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:18,934
Because, honestly,
this is the kind of conversation

1150
01:09:18,958 --> 01:09:21,038
where a little red sniper dot
pops up on my forehead.

1151
01:09:21,083 --> 01:09:22,083
Hey, yo!

1152
01:09:28,958 --> 01:09:30,517
- What's up?
- Hey, you can't be here.

1153
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,916
No? I'm sorry,
is this private property?

1154
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:36,041
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see a sign.

1155
01:09:36,125 --> 01:09:38,309
I used to come here
as a kid all the time with my grandfather.

1156
01:09:38,333 --> 01:09:40,517
I thought it was reopening.
I was hoping to see some dog races.

1157
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:42,666
Nah, no dogs in Massachusetts
for 20 years.

1158
01:09:43,208 --> 01:09:44,434
Oh, no, that's simply not true.

1159
01:09:44,458 --> 01:09:46,250
I see dogs all the time in Massachusetts.

1160
01:09:46,333 --> 01:09:48,083
In fact, I have one.

1161
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:50,416
Look at that. Her name's Pearl, huh?

1162
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,416
What a queen.
I named her after my grandma.

1163
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:55,083
- Now you gotta get outta here.
- Okay.

1164
01:09:55,166 --> 01:09:56,958
- Come on.
- All right. I'm sorry about that.

1165
01:09:57,458 --> 01:09:58,708
Have a good one, guys.

1166
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:12,458

<i>Ready, aim, fire!</i>

1170
01:10:30,708 --> 01:10:31,833
Fire!

1171
01:10:37,375 --> 01:10:40,750
We have come way too far
to let this take up any more of our time.

1172
01:10:40,833 --> 01:10:41,833
Fire!

1173
01:10:42,916 --> 01:10:44,083
Cat and the bell.

1174
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:48,583
Group of mice live very happily in a barn

1175
01:10:48,666 --> 01:10:52,708
until, one day, a feral cat
starts eating the mice.

1176
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:54,958
<i>So, they all gather together one night</i>

1177
01:10:55,041 --> 01:10:58,250
<i>to figure out what to do
about this feral cat.</i>

1178
01:10:59,833 --> 01:11:01,142
So, one of the younger mice speaks up.

1179
01:11:01,166 --> 01:11:02,333
Fire!

1180
01:11:02,416 --> 01:11:04,142
<i>"Why don't we place
a bell around his neck</i>

1181
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:06,125
<i>so that every time he's coming,
we can hear him?"</i>

1182
01:11:06,708 --> 01:11:10,125
One of the older mice says,
"That is an excellent idea,

1183
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:15,416
but whom shall we get to place
the bell around the cat's neck?"

1184
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,750
Fire!

1185
01:11:17,458 --> 01:11:18,666
So, what do we do, then?

1186
01:11:20,583 --> 01:11:22,708
Sometimes you gotta just kill the cat.

1187
01:12:01,458 --> 01:12:03,791
- I heard you just got out.
- Oh, man.

1188
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:06,416
Oh, I bet you could use
a good meal.

1189
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:09,125
Missed you, buddy.
Yeah, I need, uh, four burrito.

1190
01:12:09,208 --> 01:12:10,208
Four burrito.

1191
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:12,250
- Uh, carne asada.
- Oh, you like that.

1192
01:12:12,333 --> 01:12:15,541
And, uh, <i>pollo,</i> uh, <i>puerco.</i>
And you know what? Chorizo.

1193
01:12:15,625 --> 01:12:17,625
Chorizo. You got it.

1194
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:18,976
<i>Puerco.</i> And you know what?

1197
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:26,500
- Uh... enchilada.
- An enchilada.

1198
01:12:26,583 --> 01:12:29,625
- How's <i>mijo?</i>
- Oh, <i>mijo</i> is fine.

1199
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:32,583
I wasn't gonna ask you.
I haven't seen you in a while.

1200
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:36,267
- Yeah. Wife is good?
- Yeah. <i>Muy bien.</i>

1201
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:38,958
What about, uh, quesadilla?

1202
01:12:39,541 --> 01:12:43,000
Oh. If you want quesadilla,
just gotta wait on the tortilla.

1203
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:48,250
Quesadilla's...

1204
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:53,791
Oh, my wife Julia,
oh, she's so great.

1205
01:12:53,875 --> 01:12:56,250
Yeah. She's great.

1206
01:13:37,708 --> 01:13:39,125
No!

1207
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:42,333
Fuck!

1208
01:13:50,458 --> 01:13:52,333
Yo! Get in!

1209
01:13:58,208 --> 01:13:59,625
Oh, shit!

1210
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:02,791
- You're in big trouble.
- For what?

1211
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:04,958
You smashed the Riviera
through a restaurant!

1212
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:05,875
Get in the car!

1213
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:07,184
I'm tellin' Henry
you were driving the car.

1214
01:14:16,166 --> 01:14:18,000
Man, you get beat up a lot.

1215
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:21,083
And I've noticed every single time
you get your face pushed in,

1216
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:23,375
you come back with just
a little bit more information.

1217
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:25,875
- Would you stop?
- I'm just saying.

1218
01:14:25,958 --> 01:14:27,583
I don't think it's a very good tactic.

1219
01:14:27,666 --> 01:14:28,708
They know who I am now.

1220
01:14:28,791 --> 01:14:30,226
- No shit!
- They're gonna know where to find me.

1221
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:31,976
They're gonna
come looking for me at Henry's.

1222
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,708
They'll find Henry at Henry's.

1223
01:14:34,791 --> 01:14:35,791
Shit!

1224
01:14:42,708 --> 01:14:44,559
I hope you brought towels.
This isn't a Motel Six.

1225
01:14:44,583 --> 01:14:46,458
Hey. We're here two days, four days max.

1226
01:14:46,541 --> 01:14:49,666
It's not safe at Henry's.
Nobody's gonna look for us here.

1227
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:51,375
Who won't look for you here?

1228
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:53,708
Law enforcement. Trinitarios.

1229
01:14:53,791 --> 01:14:55,583
Oh, the good guys and the bad guys.

1230
01:14:55,666 --> 01:14:57,166
That makes me feel much better.

1231
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:59,125
It's also repetitive behavior.

1232
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:02,041
Hi.
Spenser.

1233
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:05,000
Is this your house or a kennel?

1234
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:08,541
Both. I clean dogs,
I board dogs and I am...

1235
01:15:08,625 --> 01:15:09,625
Come here.

1236
01:15:09,666 --> 01:15:11,791
And I am very successful at it, all right?

1237
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:13,267
What did you expect? Punching bags?

1238
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:15,476
A bunch of grown men kicking
each other in the fuckin' neck?

1239
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,684
- Go to Henry's for that.
- Hey.

1240
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:19,333
- Leave my business out of it.
- I expected more from you.

1241
01:15:19,416 --> 01:15:21,541
You're supposed to be his mentor.

1242
01:15:21,625 --> 01:15:24,000
Create an atmosphere of
responsible thought and action.

1243
01:15:24,083 --> 01:15:26,750
Instead, you got two grown men
runnin' around playing Batman.

1244
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:28,458
We're not playing Batman, okay?

1245
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:30,666
This is Batman business all the way.

1246
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:33,833
Got you and big boy over here
running through Boston all Robin-ed up.

1247
01:15:33,916 --> 01:15:35,458
I am not Robin.

1248
01:15:35,541 --> 01:15:37,125
And Alfred over here...

1249
01:15:37,208 --> 01:15:38,958
Uh... Oh, Jesus.

1250
01:15:39,041 --> 01:15:41,125
You are an enabling Alfred.

1251
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:43,333
You gave him the keys to the Batmobile.

1252
01:15:43,416 --> 01:15:45,500
The Riv is not the Batmobile.

1253
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:47,291
Well, it serves the same purpose.

1254
01:15:47,375 --> 01:15:49,083
Are we really gonna stay here?

1255
01:15:49,166 --> 01:15:52,250
Because I'd rather take my chances
with the Trinitarios.

1256
01:15:52,333 --> 01:15:53,653
At least they don't talk so much.

1257
01:15:53,708 --> 01:15:56,583
No. Because they're too busy
trying to shoot you.

1258
01:15:56,666 --> 01:15:58,833
You know, actually, they prefer machetes.

1259
01:15:58,916 --> 01:16:00,916
Well, they're angry.

1260
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,291
Okay, well, I feel so much better now.

1261
01:16:04,375 --> 01:16:05,500
So, I'm just gonna go.

1262
01:16:05,583 --> 01:16:06,583
Let's go, boys.

1263
01:16:06,666 --> 01:16:08,875
Snowball, Rosco, Smokey. Let's go.

1264
01:16:19,375 --> 01:16:20,458
You hungry?

1265
01:16:38,291 --> 01:16:39,458
Spenser?

1266
01:16:52,916 --> 01:16:53,916
Did you call the police?

1267
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:55,750
No.

1268
01:16:55,833 --> 01:16:58,708
And why would I? They probably did this.

1269
01:17:15,625 --> 01:17:16,625
Hey.

1270
01:17:18,125 --> 01:17:19,458
Are you a giant?

1271
01:17:20,708 --> 01:17:21,750
Yeah.

1272
01:17:21,833 --> 01:17:24,125
Are you a good one or a bad one?

1273
01:17:24,208 --> 01:17:25,500
I'm a good one.

1274
01:17:25,583 --> 01:17:27,958
Can you pull my bed over?

1275
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:30,291
I think I could handle that.

1276
01:17:47,166 --> 01:17:49,250
I want you to put the pillow on the bed.

1277
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,125
Can you do that?

1278
01:17:57,666 --> 01:17:58,916
Both pillows.

1279
01:18:02,833 --> 01:18:05,713
Where would Terrence keep something
if he didn't want anybody to find it?

1280
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:07,750
I don't know.

1281
01:18:08,416 --> 01:18:10,536
Well, do you have any idea
what they were looking for?

1282
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:15,250
What?

1283
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:17,750
Do you know what they were looking for?

1284
01:18:18,333 --> 01:18:19,416
No, I don't.

1285
01:18:26,083 --> 01:18:27,333
Why are you doing this?

1286
01:18:28,958 --> 01:18:30,666
'Cause it's the right thing to do.

1287
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:48,791
Terrence...

1288
01:18:50,291 --> 01:18:53,583
mailed this to me the day he died.

1289
01:18:58,833 --> 01:19:00,041
It's a wire.

1290
01:19:00,125 --> 01:19:01,375
I know what it is.

1291
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:03,375
Did you listen to it?

1292
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I don't know how.

1293
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:07,041
I do.

1294
01:19:28,416 --> 01:19:30,750
- You have some place you can stay?
- No.

1295
01:19:31,916 --> 01:19:33,458
We're not goin' anywhere.

1296
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:36,333
I'm not getting chased out of my own home.

1297
01:19:36,416 --> 01:19:37,708
Well, good for you.

1298
01:19:39,125 --> 01:19:40,125
All right, look.

1299
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:42,791
I'm gonna call you
when I know something, okay?

1300
01:19:44,291 --> 01:19:45,875
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1301
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:48,541
Can I hold on to this?

1302
01:19:49,958 --> 01:19:51,833
It's got his handwriting on it.

1303
01:19:51,916 --> 01:19:53,041
Of course.

1304
01:19:54,041 --> 01:19:56,791
All right. I'll call you soon. Come on.

1305
01:19:58,375 --> 01:19:59,726
<i>Come on, Boylan.</i>

1306
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:02,666
<i>We both want to get home
to our families. Help me out.</i>

1307
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:06,166
<i>You got no fuckin' idea
how deep this shit goes.</i>

1308
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:07,916
<i>So, tell me.</i>

1309
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,291
<i>Now, that information
is way above my pay grade, Mr. Altar Boy.</i>

1310
01:20:11,375 --> 01:20:12,375
<i>But high up.</i>

1311
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:15,041
<i>High up.</i>

1312
01:20:15,125 --> 01:20:18,250
All right, Los Oscuros is just
one seat at this fuckin' table.

1313
01:20:18,333 --> 01:20:19,375
Oh, come on.

1314
01:20:20,083 --> 01:20:21,333
The Feds.

1315
01:20:21,916 --> 01:20:23,875
Give me something good
to whet their appetite.

1316
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:25,892
What are you guys using
the Trinitario drug money for?

1317
01:20:25,916 --> 01:20:27,166
What do you think?

1318
01:20:28,083 --> 01:20:29,708
It's our ticket into Wonderland.

1319
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:33,916
Permits, pay-offs, construction.
All that. Dirty cops.

1320
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,583
- Like you?
- Yeah, like me.

1321
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:40,125
Who's running this thing?
How does it work?

1322
01:20:40,208 --> 01:20:42,125
Trinitarios are working for Bentwood.

1323
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:47,958
<i>Bentwood works for Macklin.
And they all work for Driscoll.</i>

1324
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,291
They already know this.

1325
01:20:51,041 --> 01:20:52,750
I need something concrete, Boylan.

1326
01:20:52,833 --> 01:20:54,583
Come on, man. I'm on your side.

1327
01:20:56,666 --> 01:20:58,833
Let me help you get
the best deal out of this.

1328
01:20:58,916 --> 01:21:00,750
<i>Tell me about the Pony Express.</i>

1329
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:02,750
<i>I'll make it clear.</i>

1330
01:21:02,833 --> 01:21:07,458
<i>Trinitario street gang and Tracksuit
Charlie do the Pony Express once a week.</i>

1331
01:21:07,541 --> 01:21:10,958
<i>You tell your fuckin' Feds
to picture the biggest shipment</i>

1332
01:21:11,041 --> 01:21:14,625
of fentanyl and oxy that they can imagine.

1333
01:21:15,208 --> 01:21:18,541
All right? And when they get that picture,
tell 'em to triple it.

1334
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:20,208
Where and when?

1335
01:21:23,375 --> 01:21:25,958
I will tell you that once I get my deal.

1336
01:21:29,375 --> 01:21:31,833
<i>Trinitarios are working for Bentwood.</i>

1337
01:21:31,916 --> 01:21:33,392
I swear to God, I didn't give anything!

1338
01:21:33,416 --> 01:21:34,541
You're a rat, Boylan.

1339
01:21:34,625 --> 01:21:36,291
<i>Bentwood works for Macklin.</i>

1340
01:21:36,375 --> 01:21:38,500
Bad things happen
to tattletales, don't they?

1341
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:40,875
<i>And they all work for Driscoll.</i>

1342
01:21:40,958 --> 01:21:43,583
I didn't give them anything, I swear!

1343
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:46,208
This is my favorite part, you fuckin' rat.

1344
01:21:47,083 --> 01:21:50,500
I see you got kara... Excuse me,
karate, after school today, right?

1345
01:21:50,583 --> 01:21:51,416
Yes, sir.

1346
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:53,226
You gonna be able to get
yourself home from there?

1347
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:54,250
Yes.

1348
01:21:54,833 --> 01:21:56,833
- I need you home by 5:00.
- Yes, sir.

1349
01:21:56,916 --> 01:21:58,041
- No later.
- Yes.

1350
01:21:58,125 --> 01:21:59,925
- 5:00 p.m. What time you comin' home?
- 5:00.

1351
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,520
Please don't be late.
Your mother's killing me about this, so...

1352
01:22:08,708 --> 01:22:09,791
Stay right here.

1353
01:22:18,458 --> 01:22:20,500
- Spenser.
- Hey.

1354
01:22:20,583 --> 01:22:21,875
What are you, lost?

1355
01:22:22,666 --> 01:22:24,426
Nah. Just happened
to be in the neighborhood.

1356
01:22:26,208 --> 01:22:27,875
Okay. Okay.

1357
01:22:31,708 --> 01:22:34,666
The fuck
you doin' here, Spenser?

1358
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,208
I know about Wonderland, brother.

1359
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:42,958
I know you're in deep.

1360
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:51,708
You got any proof, Spenser?

1361
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:56,458
Yeah. Too much.

1362
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:04,208
You know, the good cop
that I know, if he's still in...

1363
01:23:08,333 --> 01:23:09,916
All right.

1364
01:23:10,541 --> 01:23:12,309
Tell you what,
I'm gonna give you

1365
01:23:12,333 --> 01:23:15,000
one last chance
to come clean about Wonderland.

1366
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:19,791
Cut a deal with the Feds, tell them
the truth before more people get hurt.

1367
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:23,375
You do your time like a man, brother.

1368
01:23:23,916 --> 01:23:24,916
Like I did.

1369
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:29,708
Be a hero for Josh.

1370
01:23:38,708 --> 01:23:40,583
Get the fuck outta here.

1371
01:23:44,875 --> 01:23:46,375
That's what I figured.

1372
01:23:48,041 --> 01:23:51,000
You always were a hard-head. Just like me.

1373
01:23:51,916 --> 01:23:54,166
Bye, roommate.

1374
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:09,026
<i>Trinitarios

<i>Bentwood works for Macklin.

1376
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:17,291
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna get this done?

1377
01:24:17,375 --> 01:24:20,250
Agent Burton, just use the tape
to clear Terrence Graham's name.

1378
01:24:20,333 --> 01:24:22,333
This tape? It's not enough.

1379
01:24:22,416 --> 01:24:24,625
What are you talking about?
Even without the tape.

1380
01:24:24,708 --> 01:24:26,416
The drugs are enough physical evidence

1381
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,142
for a RICO case against
the whole Wonderland crew!

1382
01:24:28,166 --> 01:24:29,851
<i>...Trinitario drug money for?</i>

1383

<i>What do you think?</i>

1384
01:24:30,791 --> 01:24:34,458
I'm sorry. I understand how you feel
but I can't tell you any more.

1385
01:24:35,208 --> 01:24:37,375
Oh, my God. Now that's bullshit.

1386
01:24:37,458 --> 01:24:39,916
You wanna help that cop's family?

1387
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,333
Walk away. We've got bigger fish to fry.

1388
01:24:42,416 --> 01:24:44,291
We're the FBI. You push us,

1389
01:24:44,375 --> 01:24:47,750
we will make so much crap
fly around for you and for Letitia,

1390
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:49,958
that you'll go back to Walpole.
And CPS will...

1394
01:24:55,583 --> 01:25:00,125
<i>It's Tracksuit Charlie, movin' drugs

<i>That's what the Pony Express is.</i>

1396

Hello, ladies.

01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:07,000
Lookin' more beautiful
than you did when you got here.

1398
01:25:07,083 --> 01:25:08,875
There's someone here to see you.

1399
01:25:08,958 --> 01:25:09,958
Who?

1400
01:25:15,583 --> 01:25:17,375
No, no, no! Okay, Spense.

1401
01:25:17,458 --> 01:25:19,125
Tell me about the Pony Express.

1402
01:25:21,208 --> 01:25:23,833
Who's runnin' the drugs?
Gonna tell me what I wanna know?

1403
01:25:25,333 --> 01:25:27,708
I wanna know everything.
Who's drivin'?

1404
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:30,625
What they're drivin'?
Where they're comin' from? When and where?

1405
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:32,458
You're going to tell me everything!

1406
01:25:34,333 --> 01:25:36,291
Hey, man! They will cut your head off...

1407
01:25:36,375 --> 01:25:38,166
Oh, really?

1408
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:39,958
What are they driving, Charlie?

1409
01:25:44,375 --> 01:25:47,208
Refrigeration van.
Coming from New Hampshire.

1410
01:25:47,291 --> 01:25:49,541
Okay. It's coming down the pipes.

1411
01:25:49,625 --> 01:25:51,333
It's hid in the refrigeration tanks.

1412
01:25:51,416 --> 01:25:52,833
- <i>When?
- Tomorrow.</i>

1413
01:25:52,916 --> 01:25:54,267
- <i>When?
- Today! Noon.</i>

1414
01:25:54,291 --> 01:25:56,416
<i>Which one?</i>

1415
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:58,517
<i>- What day do you meet, Charlie?
- Today!</i>

1416
01:26:29,041 --> 01:26:30,458
Excuse me, sir. Are you okay?

1417
01:26:31,041 --> 01:26:33,666
Oh, my God. You've got blood
all over you. Let me see?

1418
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,125
No.

1419
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:48,250
Oh, shit.

1420
01:26:50,916 --> 01:26:52,642
- You forgot one in the back.
- I forgot one in the back?

1421
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:54,476
It's the driver's responsibility
to check the back.

1422
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,250
Who makes these rules?

1423
01:26:56,333 --> 01:26:57,833
Hey. Hey! Hey!

1424
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,375
You motherfuckers is dead.

1425
01:27:04,458 --> 01:27:05,833
Shit! Fuck.

1426
01:27:05,916 --> 01:27:07,208
You... You dead.

1427
01:27:08,291 --> 01:27:09,291
Yous is dead.

1428
01:27:12,291 --> 01:27:13,291
Oh, shit.

1429
01:27:18,291 --> 01:27:20,666
Every single one of them is full. Huh?

1430
01:27:21,583 --> 01:27:24,041
This is how the cops are buying
their way into Wonderland.

1431
01:27:24,125 --> 01:27:26,833
Jesus Christ! I haven't
done drugs in 20 years.

1432
01:27:26,916 --> 01:27:28,392
I don't even know
what I'm lookin' at here.

1433
01:27:28,416 --> 01:27:31,041
Fentanyl, oxy, coke.

1434
01:27:31,125 --> 01:27:32,525
It's half the drugs in New England.

1435
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:34,791
Isn't this just gonna piss 'em off?

1436
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:38,000
Yeah, it's gonna piss 'em off once
they end up in federal prison, absolutely.

1437
01:27:39,041 --> 01:27:40,142
Uh, I don't know if it's enough.

1438
01:27:40,166 --> 01:27:41,833
You don't know if it's enough?

1439
01:27:41,916 --> 01:27:43,250
What is wrong with you?

1440
01:27:43,333 --> 01:27:45,013
It's just
a truck full of drugs!

1441
01:27:45,083 --> 01:27:46,767
If I gave you a photograph
of them smiling and holding it,

1442
01:27:46,791 --> 01:27:48,559
- you'd say it wasn't authenticated.
- No, that'd be good.

1443
01:27:48,583 --> 01:27:49,783
- Yeah.
- Them holding it? Huh?

1444
01:27:49,833 --> 01:27:52,083
If I gave you a video tape,
you'd say it was doctored.

1445
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:54,142
If I walked them into court
with the drugs in their hands,

1446
01:27:54,166 --> 01:27:55,333
you'll say they were coerced.

1447
01:27:55,416 --> 01:27:56,541
You're unbelievable.

1448
01:28:04,125 --> 01:28:05,916
Calm down.

1449
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:07,500
Sit!

1450
01:28:08,041 --> 01:28:09,333
- Shit!
- This is not good.

1451
01:28:09,416 --> 01:28:10,541
That dude ID'd us.

1452
01:28:12,333 --> 01:28:14,213
- Jesus Christ.
- Jesus Christ, man...

1453
01:28:14,541 --> 01:28:17,166
Ringo, what's wrong? What's wrong, baby?

1454
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:19,500
What is it, baby? What's up, baby?

1455
01:28:20,166 --> 01:28:21,666
What is it, Ringo?

1456
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:22,791
Whose van is that?

1457
01:28:22,875 --> 01:28:24,875
That's... It's Hawk's. He got a job.

1458
01:28:24,958 --> 01:28:26,101
- Yeah.
- I'm just helping him.

1459
01:28:26,125 --> 01:28:28,291
- It's just like a side hustle thing.
- Uh-huh.

1460
01:28:28,375 --> 01:28:31,041
You know what Ringo here's job was
before he retired?

1461
01:28:31,125 --> 01:28:32,934
- Do you know what his main hustle was?
- What?

1462
01:28:32,958 --> 01:28:34,333
He was a narcotics dog.

1463
01:28:34,416 --> 01:28:36,291
Bingo! Ringo.

1464
01:28:37,166 --> 01:28:39,125
- Don't let that thing in here!
- Oi! Oi!

1465
01:28:41,625 --> 01:28:42,976
Go back inside.
I need you guys...

1466
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:43,916
What the fuck is that?

1467
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,916
You brought drugs into my garage?

1468
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,083
Just do me a favor.
Go back in the house with Henry.

1469
01:28:50,666 --> 01:28:52,041
What did you do?

1470
01:28:53,416 --> 01:28:54,500
Henry?

1471
01:28:54,583 --> 01:28:55,458
Spenser!

1472
01:28:55,541 --> 01:28:56,559
I told everybody
to stay in the house.

1473
01:28:56,583 --> 01:28:58,125
- Spenser!
- Where's Henry?

1474
01:28:58,208 --> 01:29:00,500
- He's not here.
- Why is he not here?

1475
01:29:00,583 --> 01:29:02,291
He... he wanted to go home.

1476
01:29:02,375 --> 01:29:04,851
- He said he wanted to go.
- I specifically told you to stay here!

1477
01:29:04,875 --> 01:29:05,750
Why would you let him leave?

1478
01:29:05,833 --> 01:29:08,166
What am I supposed to do?
Chain him to the radiator?

1479
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:10,142
- Where is he gonna go?
- He wanted to go home!

1480
01:29:10,166 --> 01:29:11,566
Oh, my God. You gotta be kidding...

1481
01:29:14,125 --> 01:29:15,625
Shit, he's FaceTiming me.

1482
01:29:15,708 --> 01:29:17,750
Henry doesn't know how to FaceTime.

1483
01:29:20,708 --> 01:29:21,708
<i>Spenser.</i>

1484
01:29:27,625 --> 01:29:28,666
What do you want?

1485
01:29:29,166 --> 01:29:32,375
I want us to sit down and talk
and throw everything on the table.

1486
01:29:33,125 --> 01:29:34,541
<i>Work this out before...</i>

1487
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:37,125
I have to kill Henry here.

1488
01:29:37,208 --> 01:29:38,833
Hey. Don't touch him.

1489
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:42,041
You hear me? Do not touch him.

1490
01:29:42,125 --> 01:29:44,250
These guys are a bunch of idiots, Spenser.

1491
01:29:44,333 --> 01:29:45,726
- Spenser...
<i>- Put Driscoll back on.</i>

1492
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:47,708
Fuck 'em. Hang up.
He hit me in the eye.

1493
01:29:48,291 --> 01:29:49,958
Where are ya? I'll come there right now.

1494
01:29:50,541 --> 01:29:53,000
Wonderland. One hour.

1495
01:29:53,083 --> 01:29:54,333
I'm on my way.

1496
01:29:55,791 --> 01:29:57,583
And bring my drug shipment.

1497
01:30:03,541 --> 01:30:04,875
What are we gonna do?

1498
01:30:11,375 --> 01:30:12,791
You're with me?

1499
01:30:19,583 --> 01:30:20,583
Okay.

1500
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:22,708
- Look.
- Mmm.

1501
01:30:22,791 --> 01:30:25,791
Wonderland is basically
like an abandoned fortress.

1502
01:30:25,875 --> 01:30:28,541
And there's pretty much
only one way in, right here.

1503
01:30:28,625 --> 01:30:30,601
It's the middle of the day.
There's not a lot of places to hide.

1504
01:30:30,625 --> 01:30:32,385
We're gonna have to get
Henry out of the way.

1505
01:30:32,458 --> 01:30:34,000
And I got a plan.

1506
01:30:34,083 --> 01:30:36,625
It's a little unconventional.
You're gonna have to trust me.

1507
01:30:38,833 --> 01:30:41,083
No, no, no.
No, you don't get the cool gun.

1508
01:30:41,166 --> 01:30:43,958
Aw. Hawk is the name of
a motherfucker with a shotgun.

1509
01:30:44,041 --> 01:30:45,291
Spenser does your taxes.

1510
01:30:46,625 --> 01:30:48,208
That was good. I'll give you that one.

1511
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
All right.

1512
01:31:00,041 --> 01:31:01,881
You know,
I'd really love to understand

1513
01:31:01,916 --> 01:31:03,875
the process of why you took me
as a hostage.

1514
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:05,291
Nobody's gonna come for me.

1515
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:07,625
I got about three minutes left in me.

1516
01:31:07,708 --> 01:31:09,291
Nobody gives a shit if I live or die.

1517
01:31:09,375 --> 01:31:11,333
I don't even care much if I live or die.

1518
01:31:11,416 --> 01:31:14,500
You hit me in the eye.
What you hit me in the eye for?

1519
01:31:14,583 --> 01:31:16,291
I was sitting, minding my own business.

1520
01:31:16,375 --> 01:31:19,458
You come in, I say, "Hello,"
and you hit me in the eye.

1521
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:36,730
- I gotta go to the bathroom.
- Henry.

1522
01:31:37,083 --> 01:31:38,125
- What?
- Henry.

1523
01:31:38,708 --> 01:31:40,375
I will gag you, old-timer.

1524
01:31:40,958 --> 01:31:43,333
Gag me or not, I still gotta go
to the bathroom.

1525
01:33:16,125 --> 01:33:18,125
Who's running point on this shit-show?

1526
01:33:19,583 --> 01:33:20,934
Get that fuckin' sword out of my face.

1527
01:33:20,958 --> 01:33:22,875
Do you work at a Brazilian steakhouse?

1528
01:33:23,708 --> 01:33:24,875
Are you kidding me?

1529
01:33:24,958 --> 01:33:26,017
Where's Spenser?

1530
01:33:26,041 --> 01:33:27,916
You degenerates.
This is how you treat

1531
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,791
an old man, a poor
mentally-challenged old man?

1532
01:33:30,875 --> 01:33:33,458
- Let's go, Henry.
- I'm not mentally challenged.

1533
01:33:33,541 --> 01:33:35,875
Shut up, Henry! You're in shock.
Come sit down.

1534
01:33:35,958 --> 01:33:36,976
- You got a...
- What're you doin' here?

1535
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,392
...prostate the size of a grapefruit.

1536
01:33:38,416 --> 01:33:39,809
- Come here. Just sit down.
- Where's Spenser?

1537
01:33:39,833 --> 01:33:41,250
Shame on you! Did they violate you?

1538
01:33:41,333 --> 01:33:42,166
- Sexually?
- No.

1539
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:43,375
What are you talking about?

1540
01:33:43,458 --> 01:33:44,809
- Did you engage in ass-play?
- No!

1541
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:46,593
- You can tell me...
- Bitch, please.

1542
01:33:47,125 --> 01:33:48,208
Stop playin'.

1543
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:50,291
Where's Spenser?

1544
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,291
I can't tell you that.

1545
01:33:52,375 --> 01:33:54,458
I will blow your fuckin' head off.

1546
01:34:10,333 --> 01:34:11,333
What the fuck?

1547
01:34:26,458 --> 01:34:27,958
Holy shit!

1548
01:34:28,041 --> 01:34:29,625
Whoo-hoo!

1549
01:34:58,916 --> 01:35:00,517
Oh, my God.

1550
01:35:00,541 --> 01:35:01,750
This is your plan?

1551
01:35:01,833 --> 01:35:04,166
My plan only went as far
as the entrance, okay?

1552
01:35:04,875 --> 01:35:05,875
- Shit!
- Spenser!

1553
01:35:08,125 --> 01:35:09,625
I gotta get to Driscoll.

1554
01:35:09,708 --> 01:35:12,208
- Okay, go get him. I got you.
- All right.

1555
01:35:38,583 --> 01:35:39,583
He's over there!

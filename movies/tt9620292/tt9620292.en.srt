Fuck her.

26
00:01:33,836 --> 00:01:35,371
- Fuck her.
- Yeah. Fuck her.

27
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:37,507
- Fuck her.
- This is how business is done, man.

28
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,842
I mean, this is... well, it's
just a round of fucking golf.

29
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:41,244
You'd think we were
taking clients out

30
00:01:41,277 --> 00:01:42,378
- to a strip club.
- Well... well...

31
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:43,846
Which we can't even do anymore.

32
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,182
PAUL: Exactly.
We can't even do that anymore

33
00:01:46,215 --> 00:01:47,350
- since the Christmas party last year.
- Okay.

34
00:01:47,383 --> 00:01:48,818
I think it's because
the golf club

35
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:49,886
doesn't let women play there.

36
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:51,721
- So?
- (snickers)

37
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:53,590
So it means we're having
client meetings without her.

38
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:57,627
Look, she should just focus
on closing her own shit

39
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,730
instead of whining about how
we're doing better than her.

40

Jesus.

41
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:04,467
Oh, hey,
would you look at that?

42
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,402
- Good God Almighty.
- JIM: Yikes.

43
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:08,471
PAUL: Why don't you get
some dignity, sweetheart?

44
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:11,206
You know, they put themselves
in danger, girls like that.

45
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:12,609
If she's not careful,
someone's gonna take advantage.

46
00:02:12,642 --> 00:02:14,410
Especially the kind of guys
in this club.

47

(groans quietly)

48
00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:18,348
She's kind of hot.

Hey. Let's talk to Brian.

52
00:02:22,952 --> 00:02:24,487
I think he might be
amenable to the idea

53
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,788
if we all present
a very nice...

54
00:02:25,822 --> 00:02:27,890

You know, like, you'd think
you'd learn by that age, right?

58
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,765
Where even are her friends?

59
00:02:35,798 --> 00:02:37,433
Just kind of ran off somewhere?

60
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:40,503
Leaving her laying around
for anyone to pick up.

61
00:02:42,437 --> 00:02:44,941
Sounds like a challenge, Paul.

62
00:02:44,974 --> 00:02:46,776
Yeah? Maybe.

63
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:49,579

00:14:32,377 --> 00:14:34,612
("Petite Fille Amour"
continues over speakers)

322
00:14:34,646 --> 00:14:36,915
(snorting)

323
00:14:36,948 --> 00:14:38,483
(sniffs, exhales)

324
00:14:38,516 --> 00:14:40,218
You know, I'm actually
writing a novel.

325
00:14:40,251 --> 00:14:41,252
Well, kind of,

326
00:14:41,286 --> 00:14:43,621
'cause I'm such a fucking
perfectionist, you know?

327
00:14:43,655 --> 00:14:45,256
It's just taking me forever.

328
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,926
I just keep going over it
and over it and over it

329
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:50,495
in my head,
just picking at it like a scab.

330
00:14:50,528 --> 00:14:52,330
It's about, uh, I guess, like,

331
00:14:52,364 --> 00:14:54,666
what it's like to be a guy
right now, you know?

332
00:14:54,699 --> 00:14:57,102
Like, what it's like to be
a guy in the world.

333
00:14:57,135 --> 00:15:00,205
Just this gritty,
low-life, fucked-up love story.

334
00:15:00,238 --> 00:15:02,173
And it all takes place
in New York

335
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:04,442
over the course of one night.

336
00:15:05,477 --> 00:15:06,644
You know what?

337
00:15:06,678 --> 00:15:08,580
I'm gonna stop talking about it.

338
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:10,582
I don't want to jinx it.

339
00:15:10,615 --> 00:15:12,150
You do coke, right?

340
00:15:12,183 --> 00:15:14,652
- (slurring): Mm, not really.
- Oh, come on.

341
00:15:14,686 --> 00:15:17,622
(inhales deeply)
I got work in the morning.

342
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:19,657
Oh, whatever. So do I.

343
00:15:19,691 --> 00:15:21,226
(grunts)

344
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:23,395
Here.

345
00:15:23,428 --> 00:15:25,096
Get right.

346
00:15:26,097 --> 00:15:26,765
No.

347
00:15:26,798 --> 00:15:29,900
Just put your nose up to this.

348
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:32,470
No, here. Maybe just...

349
00:15:32,504 --> 00:15:34,004
(Cassandra groans quietly)

350
00:15:34,037 --> 00:15:36,307
Okay, that didn't work.

351
00:15:40,077 --> 00:15:43,415
Hey. Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

352
00:15:43,448 --> 00:15:45,383
There you go.

353
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:55,427
Oh, my God,
you are so, so pretty.

354
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,695
But why are you wearing
all that makeup?

355
00:15:57,729 --> 00:15:59,264
Do you mind me asking?

356
00:15:59,297 --> 00:16:01,633
I never understood why women
wear so much makeup.

357
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,269
It's like, you guys are so much
more beautiful without it.

358
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:07,037
It's like, guys don't even like
that kind of stuff, you know?

359
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,039
It's just this
soul-sucking system

360
00:16:09,072 --> 00:16:11,543
meant to oppress women,
and it's fucked up.

361
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:16,046
(Neil snorting)

362
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,382
(sniffing, exhales)

363
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:18,383
I want to see you.

364
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,051
- (sniffs) The real you.
- (thunder rumbling)

365
00:16:21,084 --> 00:16:25,222
With all your freckles
and your imperfections.

366
00:16:28,526 --> 00:16:29,627
(gags)

367
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:32,597
I don't feel good.

368
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,666
Could you get me
a glass of water?

369
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:37,100
Yeah. Sure.

370
00:16:41,773 --> 00:16:43,373

(sighs):
Are you fucking kidding me?

374
00:16:52,382 --> 00:16:54,619
Hey.

375
00:16:54,652 --> 00:16:56,386
Hey, you.

376
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,023
Hey!

377
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:01,492
(chuckles):
Hey.

378
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:02,727
There you are.

379
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,261
You fell asleep.

380
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:13,337
(softly):
Good girl.

381
00:17:14,772 --> 00:17:16,607
Feel better?

382
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,109
No.

383
00:17:19,142 --> 00:17:20,644
You know, I, um...

384
00:17:20,677 --> 00:17:23,113
I nearly didn't
come out tonight.

385
00:17:23,146 --> 00:17:24,782
And I am so glad that I did.

386
00:17:24,816 --> 00:17:27,084
I feel such a connection
to you.

387
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:29,119
Could you call me a cab?

388
00:17:29,152 --> 00:17:31,321
You just got here.

389
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:33,524
- No, I need to go home.
- No.

390
00:17:33,557 --> 00:17:35,459
Don't go.

391
00:17:35,492 --> 00:17:37,261
Stay.

392
00:17:37,294 --> 00:17:39,396
My God, you are so...

393
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:41,064
I need to go.

394
00:17:41,098 --> 00:17:43,100
No, you don't want to go home.

♪ ♪

401
00:18:02,886 --> 00:18:06,156
I said I need to go home.

Holy shit. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

What is this?

404

Are you some kind
of psycho or something?

405
00:18:10,894 --> 00:18:12,329
Why do you say that?

406
00:18:12,362 --> 00:18:14,164
- I just thought that you were...
- Drunk?

407

- Yeah.
- Really drunk?

408

Fuck.

00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:17,801
Yeah.

00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:19,236
Well, I'm not.

411
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:21,138
But that's good, isn't it?

412
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:23,340
- I think you should leave.
- Oh.

413
00:18:23,373 --> 00:18:25,576
- Now you want me to leave?
- No.

414
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:28,312
I just... I'm really high.

415
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:30,314
Like, I'm really fucking high
right now.

416
00:18:30,347 --> 00:18:31,848
I don't know what I'm doing.

417
00:18:31,882 --> 00:18:34,284
(inhales sharply)
I think you should go.

418
00:18:34,318 --> 00:18:37,254
But a second ago, you were
determined for me to stay.

419
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:39,289
You were pretty insistent,
actually.

420
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,491
I'm a nice guy.

421
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,393
Are you?

422
00:18:43,427 --> 00:18:45,829
I thought we had
a connection, I guess.

423
00:18:45,862 --> 00:18:47,331
A connection?

424
00:18:47,364 --> 00:18:49,165
Okay.

425
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:52,101
What do I do for a living?

426
00:18:53,235 --> 00:18:54,771
Sorry.
Maybe that one's too hard.

427
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:56,540
How old am I?

428
00:18:57,774 --> 00:19:00,510
How long have I lived
in the city?

429
00:19:01,945 --> 00:19:04,213
What are my hobbies?

430
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:08,685
What's my name?

431
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:12,389
All right.

432
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:15,291
All right, fuck,
I get your fucking point.

433
00:19:15,324 --> 00:19:16,827
What do you want from me?

434
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,695
To say that I'm an asshole?

435
00:19:18,729 --> 00:19:20,631
Fine, I'm a fucking asshole.

436
00:19:20,664 --> 00:19:22,866
- Whoa.
- (thunder crashes)

437
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:24,901
Why are you so freaked out,
Neil?

438
00:19:24,935 --> 00:19:26,369
You really need to calm down.

439
00:19:26,402 --> 00:19:28,572
At least you didn't try
to have sex with me

440
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:29,806
while I was passed out.

441
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,340
You do get points for that.

442
00:19:31,374 --> 00:19:33,810
A few guys, meh...
eh, they don't mind so much.

443
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:38,514
But you woke me up before
putting your fingers inside me.

444
00:19:38,548 --> 00:19:40,651
- That was sweet.
- What are you trying to say?

445
00:19:40,684 --> 00:19:43,252
That I'm, like,
a predator or something?

446
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:45,521
I don't know. Are you?

447
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:47,556
I am a nice guy.

448
00:19:47,591 --> 00:19:49,191
You keep saying that.

449
00:19:49,225 --> 00:19:50,861
You're not as rare as you think.

450
00:19:50,894 --> 00:19:52,763
You know how I know?

451
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:54,330
No.

452
00:19:54,363 --> 00:19:57,734
Because every week,
I go to a club,

453
00:19:57,768 --> 00:20:02,873
and every week, I act like
I'm too drunk to stand.

454
00:20:02,906 --> 00:20:05,976
- And every...
- (grunts, shudders)

455
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:10,279
...fucking week,
a nice guy like you

456
00:20:10,312 --> 00:20:13,416
comes over to see if I'm okay.

457
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:19,555
You want to fuck me still?

458
00:20:19,588 --> 00:20:21,724
(whispers):
No, thank you, ma'am.

459
00:20:21,757 --> 00:20:23,827
CASSANDRA:
Hmm.

460
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,728
No one ever does.

461
00:20:26,997 --> 00:20:29,699
Careful next time
you go out, Neil.

462
00:20:29,732 --> 00:20:32,601
Your novel sounds terrible,
by the way.

463
00:20:34,336 --> 00:20:36,572
(door opens, closes)

464
00:20:36,605 --> 00:20:38,274
(sighs heavily)

465
00:20:48,651 --> 00:20:50,786
Night, Nina.

466
00:20:56,358 --> 00:20:58,494
- (birds chirping outside)
- (clock ticking)

467
00:21:00,296 --> 00:21:02,531
What's this?

468
00:21:05,901 --> 00:21:08,270
Mom, what's this?

469
00:21:08,971 --> 00:21:10,706
What do you mean?

470
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,576
This gift.

471
00:21:15,511 --> 00:21:17,546
It's your birthday, Cassie.

472
00:21:20,516 --> 00:21:21,784
Oh.

473
00:21:23,018 --> 00:21:25,354
Yeah.

474
00:21:25,387 --> 00:21:28,424
What kind of...

475
00:21:28,457 --> 00:21:30,459
kind of person
forgets their 30th birthday?

476
00:21:30,493 --> 00:21:33,028
Oh, sweetheart, come on.
Don't...

477
00:21:33,062 --> 00:21:35,598
Don't, Stanley.
You know, please, don't.

478
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:37,500
CASSANDRA:
It was just a mistake, Mom.

479
00:21:37,533 --> 00:21:39,068
You know I'm terrible
with dates.

480
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:40,836
It's not a big deal.

481
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,471
SUSAN:
Not a big deal?

482
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:44,573
Not a big deal?

483
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:48,377
You-you just forgot
your birthday.

484
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,346
You don't want to have a party?

485
00:21:50,379 --> 00:21:52,348
You don't want to see
your friends?

486
00:21:52,381 --> 00:21:54,083
You know I don't have
any friends, Mom.

487
00:21:54,116 --> 00:21:56,919
Don't joke about it. Don't.

488
00:21:56,952 --> 00:22:00,556
Do you know how strange this is?

489
00:22:01,957 --> 00:22:04,660
You, you're still living
here at home.

490
00:22:04,693 --> 00:22:06,796
Working in that
stupid coffee shop

491
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:09,598
since you and Nina
dropped out of med school.

492
00:22:09,632 --> 00:22:12,101
You're out all night long
doing God only knows what.

493
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:13,803
- STANLEY: Okay.
- SUSAN: And you...

494
00:22:13,836 --> 00:22:15,905
You don't have any boyfriend.
You don't have any friends.

495
00:22:15,938 --> 00:22:18,941
Mom, you should have saved
all that for my birthday card.

496
00:22:18,974 --> 00:22:21,710
Why don't we just let the kid
celebrate however she wants?

497
00:22:21,744 --> 00:22:24,479
- Okay?
- SUSAN: All my friends, they ask about you.

498
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,616
I-I-I don't know
what to tell them.

499
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,985
I-I don't know
what happened here.

500
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:32,822
I don't... (sobs)

501
00:22:32,855 --> 00:22:34,957
(crying)

502
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,760
Why don't you just open
your present there, Cass?

503
00:22:37,793 --> 00:22:39,094
Okay?

504
00:22:39,128 --> 00:22:40,896
Go ahead.

505
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,932
SUSAN:
Yeah.

506
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:56,278
Oh, I hope you like it.

507
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:02,517
Thank you.

- GAIL: <i>Whoa.</i>

509
00:23:07,522 --> 00:23:09,158
- CASSANDRA: Yeah.
- That's direct.

510
00:23:09,191 --> 00:23:11,659
A real kick in the cunt.

511
00:23:11,693 --> 00:23:14,029
- Is it a nice suitcase, at least?
- Oh, yeah.

512
00:23:14,063 --> 00:23:15,331
It's definitely the fanciest

513
00:23:15,363 --> 00:23:18,133
"get the fuck out of our house"
metaphor I've received so far.

514
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:19,068
So, why don't you?

515
00:23:19,101 --> 00:23:21,003
- What?
- Get the fuck out of their house.

516
00:23:21,036 --> 00:23:24,472
- Just, I don't know, go on Zillow or...

<i>Single White Female</i> some girl.

518

Get a basement room at some
weird guy's house, anything.

519
00:23:28,911 --> 00:23:30,812
- (door closes)
- I can't afford it, Gail.

520
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:32,413
Not on what you pay me.

521
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:34,149
Not even a weird guy's basement.

522
00:23:34,183 --> 00:23:36,185
So take this other job, then.

523
00:23:36,218 --> 00:23:37,186
Take any job.

524
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:39,454
Are you firing me?

525
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:41,456
Maybe I should.

526
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:43,791
Look, you're making
the assumption

527
00:23:43,825 --> 00:23:45,493
that I want any of it.

528
00:23:45,526 --> 00:23:46,661
If I wanted a boyfriend

529
00:23:46,694 --> 00:23:48,596
and a yoga class
and a house and kids

530
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,899
and a job my mom could
brag about, I'd have done it.

531
00:23:50,932 --> 00:23:54,035
It would take me ten minutes.
I don't want it.

532
00:23:54,069 --> 00:23:55,837
I don't want it.

533
00:23:56,704 --> 00:23:58,473
But you must want something.

534

- RYAN: Hey.

535
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:03,145
- (Ryan clears throat)
- Oh. You.

536
00:24:03,178 --> 00:24:05,914
- Hi.
- One coffee, hold the spit.

537
00:24:05,947 --> 00:24:06,915
(Ryan chuckling)

538
00:24:06,948 --> 00:24:09,484
She spat in my coffee last time.

539
00:24:10,151 --> 00:24:12,553
I'm back because, um,

540
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:16,090
I think you gave me a...
a fake number the other day.

541
00:24:16,124 --> 00:24:18,059
Mm, that doesn't sound like me.

542
00:24:18,092 --> 00:24:19,193
I know.

543
00:24:19,228 --> 00:24:21,230
So I spent a few hours composing

544
00:24:21,263 --> 00:24:23,798
a, like, very witty,
very romantic text,

545
00:24:23,831 --> 00:24:28,069
and then I sent that text to
an oil rig worker called Red.

546
00:24:28,102 --> 00:24:30,204
- Was he into it?
- Surprisingly into it.

547
00:24:30,238 --> 00:24:33,541
It was, like,
immediately inappropriate.

548
00:24:33,574 --> 00:24:36,077
But it's not gonna work out
'cause of the oil rig,

549
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:40,081
so I thought I'd try you again.

550
00:24:40,114 --> 00:24:42,216
I just heard a phone ring
in the back.

551
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,619
- No, you didn't.
- I most definitely heard

552
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:46,521
a phone ring in the back.
(chuckles)

553
00:24:46,554 --> 00:24:49,958
She has to take a few
imaginary calls a day.

554
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:51,926
(Gail laughing)

555
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,697
Um, look, if you're not
into this, totally get it.

556
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,733
I'm not really looking to date
anyone at the moment.

557
00:24:58,766 --> 00:25:00,735
Right. Yeah.

558
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:01,936
Me, neither.

559
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,840
Would you... be interested
in a friendship

560
00:25:05,873 --> 00:25:10,111
and I'm secretly pining for you
the whole time?

561
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,546
(Cassandra chuckles)

562
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:13,247
Dating's horrible.
Everyone's horrible.

563
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:15,583
Okay, I went on a date
last month with a woman

564
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:16,851
who wanted to euthanize
the homeless.

565
00:25:16,884 --> 00:25:18,586
You went on a date with my mom?

566
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:19,721
(laughs) Look,

567
00:25:19,754 --> 00:25:22,256
I always liked you
at med school.

568
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,624
Okay?

569
00:25:23,658 --> 00:25:25,727
I genuinely like you,

570
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,162
and I can't stop thinking about
you spitting in my coffee.

571
00:25:28,196 --> 00:25:31,032
So go to lunch with me
this weekend.

572
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:33,901
Please. If you don't like it,
we can have a safe word

573
00:25:33,935 --> 00:25:37,005
and you can leave,
no questions asked.

574

ROBERT MITCHUM:
<i>Not that you mind the killings.</i>

575
00:25:38,806 --> 00:25:40,607
Your book is full of killings.

576
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,010
(gearbox grinding)

577
00:25:42,043 --> 00:25:44,746
But there are things
you do hate, Lord.

578
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:47,015
Perfume-smelling things.

579
00:25:47,048 --> 00:25:48,682
Lacy things.

580
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,151
- Things with curly hair.

Hey.

583
00:25:54,588 --> 00:25:55,890
You're all dressed up.

584
00:25:55,923 --> 00:25:57,624
Where you going?

585
00:25:57,657 --> 00:25:59,760
I'm going out for lunch.

586
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:01,896
With who?

587
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:03,630
A friend.

588
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:05,799
STANLEY:
Cassie.

589
00:26:07,368 --> 00:26:09,803
You look very pretty, honey.

590
00:26:11,372 --> 00:26:13,107
Thank you, Dad.

CASSANDRA (laughing):
<i>Where... where did she get</i>

593
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:17,979
- a skeleton's hand from?
- She got it...

594
00:26:18,012 --> 00:26:19,813
It was her, uh...
it was her grandfather's.

595
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:21,848
No. It was... She got it
from the staff room,

596
00:26:21,882 --> 00:26:25,186
but the worst part is
she looked me in the eye,

597
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:28,256
pulled it out
and then waved it at me.

598
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:29,856
(both laughing)

599
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,625
And I am done.

600
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:33,794
And I'm wondering why
I told that story.

601
00:26:33,827 --> 00:26:36,797
Hey. There is nothing more
romantic than a disturbed woman

602
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,599
pulling a skeleton's hand
out of her vagina.

603
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:40,801
That's true.
That's very true.

604
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:43,670
No one ever pulls anything
out of anywhere where I work.

605
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:45,072
Right, so you didn't want to...

606
00:26:45,106 --> 00:26:47,175
- What?
- Carry on with med school or...

607
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:48,608
No.

608
00:26:48,642 --> 00:26:50,211
Really? Why not?

609
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:52,746
I wanted to do something else.

610
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:53,980
Why?

611
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:54,981
(laughs) I don't know.

612
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:57,318
You were so good, though.
You knew everything.

613
00:26:57,351 --> 00:26:59,320
- You...
- I didn't know everything.

614
00:26:59,353 --> 00:27:01,688
You did.
You were incredible.

615
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:04,091
I was... I was awful. I...

616
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:06,860
Remember I removed the
wrong kidney from my cadaver?

617
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:09,162
And look at you now...
operating on children.

618
00:27:09,196 --> 00:27:10,864
Yes. I got better.

619
00:27:10,897 --> 00:27:14,368
Thank God. But you, you were
way ahead of everybody.

620
00:27:14,402 --> 00:27:17,003
You-you would have been
a great doctor.

621
00:27:18,406 --> 00:27:21,375
Just didn't want it enough,

'Cause of the height.

- The height, I'm saying.
- (laughs): No.

633

It's like a fear

- if I'm with a woman.

if I kiss her,

like, people will be like,
"Stop kissing that child."

I mean, try not being
so tall, maybe.

00:36:31,354 --> 00:36:32,723
(Madison chuckles softly)

806
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:37,160
MADISON:
Mm.

807
00:36:38,361 --> 00:36:39,930
Mm.

808
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,799
(sighs):
Ah.

809
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:45,635
Honestly, I thought I'd be
bored out of my skull

810
00:36:45,669 --> 00:36:48,706
watching the kids,
but it's been great, actually.

811
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,809
Are we out already?
Can we get another bottle?

812
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,309
Thanks.

813
00:36:53,343 --> 00:36:55,813
I haven't been day drunk
in forever.

814
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,848
- So fun.
- So fun.

815
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,784
(both laughing)

816
00:37:01,317 --> 00:37:05,555
TBH, I know all guys say
they want wives that work,

817
00:37:05,588 --> 00:37:07,858
but it's not true.

818
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,459
- No?
- No.

819
00:37:09,492 --> 00:37:12,295
I mean, they all want
a feminist in college,

820
00:37:12,328 --> 00:37:13,630
because it's cool
to have a girlfriend

821
00:37:13,663 --> 00:37:14,999
- who cares about something.
- (chuckles)

822
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,466
And, statistically,

823
00:37:16,499 --> 00:37:18,435
feminists are more likely
to do anal.

824
00:37:18,468 --> 00:37:19,970
That's a literal fact,
by the way.

825
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,304
Really?

826
00:37:21,337 --> 00:37:22,405
You know, when it
comes down to it,

827
00:37:22,439 --> 00:37:23,974
all guys want the same thing.

828
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:25,809
And what's that?

829
00:37:25,842 --> 00:37:28,012
(sighs) A good girl.

830
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,546
I don't seem to remember

831
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:32,615
you were that much
of a good girl in med school.

832
00:37:32,649 --> 00:37:33,850
Well, Fred... Thanks.

833
00:37:33,883 --> 00:37:35,485
Fred didn't know me at school.

834
00:37:35,518 --> 00:37:37,987
He met me when I was
working at L'Oréal.

835
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,589
Poor Fred.

836
00:37:39,622 --> 00:37:43,860
(laughs) What he doesn't know
won't kill him, right?

837
00:37:43,893 --> 00:37:45,729
I'm glad everything
has worked out

838
00:37:45,762 --> 00:37:46,963
so well for you, Madison.

839
00:37:46,996 --> 00:37:47,964
Thanks.

840
00:37:47,997 --> 00:37:49,532
- It really has.
- Yeah.

841
00:37:49,566 --> 00:37:51,401
(both chuckle)

842
00:37:51,434 --> 00:37:53,570
You know, I actually
wanted to meet you today

843
00:37:53,603 --> 00:37:55,972
to talk about something
in particular.

844
00:37:56,005 --> 00:37:57,507
I did wonder.

845
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,542
No one's heard from you
in, like, forever.

846
00:37:59,576 --> 00:38:00,577
(both chuckle)

847
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:03,480
I wanted to talk to you
about why I dropped out.

848
00:38:03,513 --> 00:38:05,949
♪ ♪

849
00:38:05,982 --> 00:38:07,350
Okay, sure.

850
00:38:07,383 --> 00:38:09,753
You remember
what happened, right?

851
00:38:11,921 --> 00:38:14,491
Um, s-such a long time ago now.

852
00:38:14,524 --> 00:38:16,726
I know, but you remember.

853
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:20,396
I mean, vaguely.

854
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,766
Do you ever think about it?

855
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:26,002
Why would I?

856
00:38:26,035 --> 00:38:28,471
Right. Why would you?

857
00:38:30,406 --> 00:38:32,475
So, if a friend came to you now,

858
00:38:32,509 --> 00:38:37,346
into your house, and told you
that they thought something bad

859
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,915
had happened to them
the night before...

860
00:38:38,948 --> 00:38:41,050
- Cassie...
- Something bad.

861
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:43,052
- It was years ago.
- What would you say?

862
00:38:43,086 --> 00:38:44,921
It w... (scoffs)

863
00:38:44,954 --> 00:38:48,357
- What would you say?
- Ugh. I'm so...

864
00:38:49,025 --> 00:38:50,593
I feel a little weird.

865
00:38:50,627 --> 00:38:52,996
Would you roll your eyes
behind her back

866
00:38:53,029 --> 00:38:54,664
and dismiss the whole thing
as drama?

867
00:38:54,697 --> 00:38:56,800
(laughs): I don't know
why you're mad at me.

868
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:59,502
Okay, I-I'm not the only one
who didn't believe it.

869
00:38:59,536 --> 00:39:01,805
If-if you have a reputation
for sleeping around,

870
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:03,773
then maybe people
aren't gonna believe you

871
00:39:03,807 --> 00:39:05,842
when you say
something's happened.

872
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:08,111
I mean...

873
00:39:08,144 --> 00:39:10,847
it's crying wolf.

874
00:39:12,514 --> 00:39:14,383
You thought it was crying wolf?

875
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:16,451
I don't make the rules.

876
00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:19,421
Look, when you get that drunk,
things happen.

877
00:39:19,454 --> 00:39:22,125
Don't get blackout drunk
all the time

878
00:39:22,158 --> 00:39:24,426
and then expect people
to be on your side

879
00:39:24,459 --> 00:39:26,696
when you have sex
with someone you don't want to.

880
00:39:26,729 --> 00:39:28,865
I mean... (scoffs)

881
00:39:31,067 --> 00:39:32,836
That's a shame.

882
00:39:32,869 --> 00:39:35,571
I was hoping you'd feel
differently by now.

883
00:39:35,604 --> 00:39:37,040
- Sorry.
- For your sake,

884
00:39:37,073 --> 00:39:39,441
I was hoping you'd feel
different by now.

885
00:39:42,145 --> 00:39:44,413
(sighs)

886
00:39:44,446 --> 00:39:46,115
(slurring):
Look... look, don't be mad.

887
00:39:46,149 --> 00:39:47,984
Just, I'll get the check,
all right?

888
00:39:48,017 --> 00:39:49,953
It's my treat.

889
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:51,687
Hello?

890
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,989
(Madison sighs)

891
00:39:53,022 --> 00:39:54,858
Are you okay, Madison?

892
00:39:56,025 --> 00:39:58,161
My head is spinning.
I just feel...

893
00:39:58,194 --> 00:40:00,129
(gasps) Oh! Shit.

894
00:40:00,163 --> 00:40:01,865
My God.

895
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:03,632
Sorry.

896
00:40:05,601 --> 00:40:09,438
It really is so great
seeing you again.

897
00:40:09,471 --> 00:40:12,441
You really haven't
changed at all.

898
00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:14,978
That's great.

899
00:40:18,947 --> 00:40:20,916
So?

900
00:40:22,051 --> 00:40:24,686
She's over there.

901
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,023
Room 25.

902
00:40:27,056 --> 00:40:29,758
Your money's in the envelope.

903
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:31,894
You sure about this?

904
00:40:31,927 --> 00:40:33,896
I'm sure.

905
00:40:35,164 --> 00:40:36,798
(door opens)

906
00:40:38,901 --> 00:40:40,035

907
00:40:40,068 --> 00:40:42,638
(cell phone vibrating)

908
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:46,675
(continues vibrating)

909
00:40:53,048 --> 00:40:54,449
(line beeps)

910
00:40:54,483 --> 00:40:55,918
MADISON (recorded):
Cassie, hi.

911
00:40:55,951 --> 00:40:58,787
Um, wonderful to see you
for lunch yesterday.

912
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,789
Blast from the past.

913
00:41:00,822 --> 00:41:02,157
Uh, hey.

914
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,059
I was pretty drunk.

915
00:41:04,092 --> 00:41:05,961
I can't really, um...

916
00:41:05,994 --> 00:41:09,932
Look, did you see me talking
to a guy, like, our age?

917
00:41:09,965 --> 00:41:11,633
He seemed to know you.

918
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:14,102
Just trying to piece
some things together.

919

(line beeps)

920
00:41:15,671 --> 00:41:17,940
Cassie, sorry.
Please call me back.

921
00:41:17,973 --> 00:41:19,608
I-I'm freaking out a little.

922
00:41:19,641 --> 00:41:21,810
I woke up in
one of the hotel rooms.

923
00:41:21,843 --> 00:41:23,545
I-I think something
might have happened.

924
00:41:23,578 --> 00:41:25,480

(music continues faintly
over stereo)

932
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,778
- See you tomorrow, bitches.
- Bye, Amber.

- CASSANDRA: Excuse me.
- Bye.

CASSANDRA:
Excuse me! Hi.

935
00:42:01,149 --> 00:42:02,584
- Me?
- Yeah.

936
00:42:02,617 --> 00:42:04,052
(chuckles):
Hi. Sorry.

937
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:05,187
What's up?

938
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,989
I'm so sorry,
but my-my phone has died,

939
00:42:07,022 --> 00:42:08,256
and I'm so late for work.

940
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,292
Do you live around here?
Do you know the area?

941
00:42:10,325 --> 00:42:11,860
I guess. Why?

942
00:42:11,893 --> 00:42:14,262
Would you tell me how to get
to the Castle Diner?

943
00:42:14,296 --> 00:42:16,597
You know what?
I'm actually, like, really late.

944
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,266
Please. I'm supposed to be
shooting this music video,

945
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,667
- and I...
- Music video?

946
00:42:19,701 --> 00:42:21,136
Uh, yeah, I'm-I'm
a makeup artist, and it's

947
00:42:21,169 --> 00:42:23,772
my first time working with
these guys, and if I'm late,

948
00:42:23,805 --> 00:42:25,874
- I may as well not...
- AMBER: Oh, my God.

949
00:42:25,907 --> 00:42:26,875
Oh, my God.

950
00:42:26,908 --> 00:42:28,243
Are you working for Wet Dreams?

951
00:42:28,276 --> 00:42:29,677
You didn't see that.

952
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,678
I know where
the Castle Diner is.

953
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:31,579
Don't worry about it.

954
00:42:31,612 --> 00:42:32,513
- I'll ask someone else.
- No way. No way.

955
00:42:32,546 --> 00:42:35,150
Oh, my God, you're working
with Wet Dreams!

956
00:42:35,183 --> 00:42:37,252
Oh, my God!
Are they there right now?

957
00:42:37,285 --> 00:42:39,287
You need to calm down, please.

958
00:42:39,321 --> 00:42:40,755
I can direct you. Please.

959
00:42:40,788 --> 00:42:42,656
Sorry. No.

960
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:46,028
If I don't direct you,
how are you gonna find it?

961
00:42:46,061 --> 00:42:47,295
I can't.

962
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:49,764
If you tell anyone
or you post about this,

963
00:42:49,797 --> 00:42:51,665
I will never work again.

964
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:53,201
I swear I won't post anything.

965
00:42:53,235 --> 00:42:54,336
I promise.

966
00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:56,704
Take my phone.
Seriously, take it.

967
00:42:57,705 --> 00:42:59,174
Ugh! God, okay.

968
00:42:59,207 --> 00:43:00,275
Get in. Fine.

969
00:43:00,308 --> 00:43:02,244
But you have to be
cool about this.

970
00:43:02,277 --> 00:43:04,179
No. Of course I will.

971
00:43:04,212 --> 00:43:06,881
(Amber squeals excitedly)

972
00:43:06,914 --> 00:43:08,050
Whoa.

973
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:09,717
You really are a fan.

974
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,819
I'm obsessed.
I have a whole Insta

975
00:43:11,852 --> 00:43:13,155
dedicated just to George's dog.

976
00:43:13,188 --> 00:43:15,323
What a crazy coincidence.

977
00:43:15,357 --> 00:43:16,657
I know.

978
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:18,592
You know what?

979
00:43:18,626 --> 00:43:20,594
This... this is fate.

980
00:43:20,628 --> 00:43:24,099
Sure seems like it, huh?

981
00:43:24,132 --> 00:43:25,866
(engine starts)

982
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,034

00:43:28,203 --> 00:43:30,571

00:43:36,644 --> 00:43:38,646
SECRETARY:
Yes?

987
00:43:40,848 --> 00:43:44,051
Dean Walker is ready,
if you'd like to go on through.

988
00:43:53,694 --> 00:43:55,830
- (door closes)
- Daisy.

989
00:43:55,863 --> 00:43:57,865
- That's me.
- Dean Walker.

990
00:43:57,898 --> 00:43:59,133
Please sit.

991
00:44:00,734 --> 00:44:03,305
My assistant says that
you are interested

992
00:44:03,338 --> 00:44:05,272
in resuming med school.

993
00:44:05,306 --> 00:44:06,674
That's right.

994
00:44:06,707 --> 00:44:08,410
May I ask what prompted
your desire

995
00:44:08,443 --> 00:44:10,177
to get back to your studies?

996
00:44:10,211 --> 00:44:12,380
I guess...

997
00:44:12,414 --> 00:44:14,949
I couldn't stop thinking
about my time here.

998
00:44:14,982 --> 00:44:17,118
Yeah.
It's an extraordinary place.

999
00:44:18,152 --> 00:44:19,987
It's an unusual request.

1000
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:23,390
Yes, but I left under
unusual circumstances.

1001
00:44:23,425 --> 00:44:24,825
Oh.

1002
00:44:24,859 --> 00:44:27,261
I left because of
what happened to Nina.

1003
00:44:27,294 --> 00:44:28,362
Hmm.

1004
00:44:28,395 --> 00:44:30,331
Nina Fisher.

1005
00:44:30,364 --> 00:44:31,966
You don't remember her?

1006
00:44:31,999 --> 00:44:36,203
Maybe you remember
Alexander Monroe?

1007
00:44:36,237 --> 00:44:37,938
Oh, yes. Alexander Monroe.

1008
00:44:37,972 --> 00:44:41,008
He actually just came back
and gave a talk here.

1009
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:43,744
Oh, he's a...
he's a really nice guy.

1010
00:44:43,777 --> 00:44:44,879
Really smart.

1011
00:44:44,912 --> 00:44:46,714
- Are you a friend of his?
- No.

1012
00:44:46,747 --> 00:44:47,948
So, you don't remember

1013
00:44:47,982 --> 00:44:49,950
the accusations made
against Al Monroe?

1014
00:44:49,984 --> 00:44:51,452
I don't.

1015
00:44:51,485 --> 00:44:54,822
He took a girl, Nina Fisher,

1016
00:44:54,855 --> 00:44:58,826
the one you don't remember,
back to his room,

1017
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:01,162
where he had sex with her
repeatedly

1018
00:45:01,195 --> 00:45:02,429
and in front of his friends

1019
00:45:02,463 --> 00:45:06,033
while she was too drunk to have
any idea what was going on.

1020
00:45:06,066 --> 00:45:08,402
She was covered in bruises
the next day.

1021
00:45:08,435 --> 00:45:11,405
Handprints,
I guess you could say.

1022
00:45:11,438 --> 00:45:13,374
Was it reported?

1023
00:45:13,407 --> 00:45:14,808
Yes.

1024
00:45:14,842 --> 00:45:16,844
Do you know who Nina spoke to?

1025
00:45:17,945 --> 00:45:19,079
You.

1026
00:45:21,282 --> 00:45:23,450
But you can't remember, so...

1027
00:45:23,484 --> 00:45:25,718
You felt there wasn't
sufficient evidence.

1028
00:45:25,752 --> 00:45:27,021
You said it was too much

1029
00:45:27,054 --> 00:45:30,124
of a "he said, she said"
situation.

1030
00:45:30,157 --> 00:45:31,258
Well...

1031
00:45:31,292 --> 00:45:35,795
you know, we get accusations
like this all the time.

1032
00:45:35,828 --> 00:45:37,198
One or two a week.

1033
00:45:37,231 --> 00:45:39,866
I'm sorry I don't remember
your friend Nina,

1034
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,468
but I can assure you,
at that time,

1035
00:45:41,502 --> 00:45:43,204
that I looked into it
thoroughly.

1036
00:45:43,237 --> 00:45:47,308
His friends were all
watching, laughing.

1037
00:45:47,341 --> 00:45:48,808
It's so hard.

1038
00:45:48,841 --> 00:45:50,777
But, you know, also,
if she was drinking

1039
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:53,846
and-and maybe couldn't
remember everything...

1040
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,949
So, she shouldn't
have been drunk?

1041
00:45:55,983 --> 00:45:58,385
- I'm not saying that. I...
- I'm sorry, I don't...

1042
00:45:58,419 --> 00:46:00,454
(chuckles): I don't mean
to sound critical, Dean Walker.

1043
00:46:00,487 --> 00:46:02,855
I just want to be clear.

1044
00:46:02,889 --> 00:46:05,092
None of us want to admit

1045
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:06,993
when we've made ourselves
vulnerable.

1046
00:46:07,026 --> 00:46:08,962
When we've made a bad choice.

1047
00:46:08,995 --> 00:46:11,098
And those choices,
those mistakes,

1048
00:46:11,131 --> 00:46:15,102
can be so damaging
and really regrettable.

1049
00:46:17,538 --> 00:46:19,506
- Regrettable?
- Yes.

1050
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,508
I mean, because
what would you have me do?

1051
00:46:21,542 --> 00:46:23,410
Ruin a young man's life

1052
00:46:23,444 --> 00:46:26,079
every time we get
an accusation like this?

1053
00:46:26,112 --> 00:46:28,948
So you're happy to take
the boy's word for it?

1054
00:46:28,982 --> 00:46:31,117
I have to give him
the benefit of the doubt.

1055
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:31,951
Of course you do.

1056
00:46:31,985 --> 00:46:34,787
Because innocent
until proven guilty.

1057
00:46:34,821 --> 00:46:37,291
No arguing with that.

1058
00:46:37,324 --> 00:46:39,393
No.

1059
00:46:39,426 --> 00:46:41,295
Thank you for your time.

1060
00:46:42,296 --> 00:46:44,331
- Is your friend okay?
- No.

1061
00:46:44,365 --> 00:46:45,865
She's not.

1062
00:46:45,898 --> 00:46:47,568
But Al Monroe is.

1063
00:46:47,601 --> 00:46:49,869
You'll be glad to hear
he's doing really well.

1064
00:46:49,902 --> 00:46:52,939
- He's getting married, actually, so...
- Hmm.

1065
00:46:52,972 --> 00:46:54,341
You know, I guess you did
the right thing.

1066
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:58,177
We have to give these boys
the benefit of the doubt.

1067
00:46:58,211 --> 00:47:00,146
That's why I know
you won't mind that,

1068
00:47:00,179 --> 00:47:03,116
three hours ago, I picked your
daughter Amber up from school

1069
00:47:03,149 --> 00:47:05,985
and introduced her to the boys
who live in that room now.

1070
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:08,288
- What?
- She is really pretty, huh?

1071
00:47:08,321 --> 00:47:10,356
(chuckles): She looks
a lot older than she is.

1072
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:12,593
- I don't believe you.
- I noticed they had a few

1073
00:47:12,626 --> 00:47:14,327
bottles of vodka
in their room, too.

1074
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,030
But I'm sure they'll take
good care of your daughter.

1075
00:47:17,063 --> 00:47:18,599
She seemed excited, actually.

She'll be wanting that later.

I told you
I don't remember that.

Well, that's a shame.

What are you doing?

She is a young girl.

I wonder if she looks so young
to those guys.

1091
00:47:57,203 --> 00:47:59,572
You better tell me
what room she's in.

1092

Tell me what fucking room
she's in!

Please tell me.

1099
00:48:28,668 --> 00:48:31,371
You're right, okay?

1100
00:48:31,404 --> 00:48:33,973
Is that what you want to hear?

1101
00:48:34,006 --> 00:48:36,075
You're right.

1102
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:40,113
You're right.

1103
00:48:44,016 --> 00:48:46,552
Look how easy it was.

1104
00:48:46,586 --> 00:48:50,022

about it in the right way.

Tell me where
my daughter is, please.

1109
00:49:10,576 --> 00:49:12,043
Relax.

1110
00:49:12,077 --> 00:49:13,546
Dean Walker,
do you really think

1111
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:15,147
I would do something like that?

1112
00:49:15,181 --> 00:49:18,049
Luckily, I don't have as much
faith in boys as you do.

1113
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:20,185
Amber is sitting in a diner,

1114
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:22,622
waiting for her favorite
boy band to show up

1115
00:49:22,655 --> 00:49:24,424
for a music video.

1116
00:49:24,457 --> 00:49:27,293
It's the Castle Diner,
if you want to call and check.

1117
00:49:27,326 --> 00:49:29,362
Or you should probably call,
actually,

1118
00:49:29,395 --> 00:49:32,063
or she may never figure out
they're not coming.

1119
00:49:32,097 --> 00:49:34,199
She's kind of an idiot, huh?

1120
00:49:35,334 --> 00:49:36,436
Gorgeous, though.

1121
00:49:36,469 --> 00:49:38,136
Who needs brains?

1122
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:40,706
They never did a girl any good.

1123
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,241
Great to see you again,
Dean Walker.

1124
00:49:46,779 --> 00:49:49,114

1446
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,261
♪ Got a heart and soul
and body... ♪

1447
01:08:29,295 --> 01:08:31,597
I haven't done this
in a pharmacy in weeks.

1448
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:33,832
- (laughing): That's weird.
- Literally weeks.

1449
01:08:33,866 --> 01:08:35,501
Thank you.

1450
01:08:35,534 --> 01:08:36,869
Sorry.

1451
01:08:36,902 --> 01:08:38,571
They're okay.

1452
01:08:38,604 --> 01:08:40,506
(crickets chirping)

1453
01:08:41,407 --> 01:08:43,242
- (gentle music playing)
- Cheese?

1454
01:08:43,275 --> 01:08:44,376
RYAN:
Would love it.

1455
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:46,445
Yeah. Thank you.

1456
01:08:48,714 --> 01:08:50,583
- Bread?
- Ah, yep.

1457
01:08:50,616 --> 01:08:52,451
Okay.

1458
01:08:53,686 --> 01:08:56,154
Mm. Oh. Thank you.

1459
01:08:56,187 --> 01:08:57,856
What a home.
It's unbelievable.

1460
01:08:57,890 --> 01:08:59,725
- So beautiful.
- Yeah, it's nice.

1461
01:08:59,758 --> 01:09:00,893
Susan works really hard.

1462
01:09:00,926 --> 01:09:03,127
- Yeah, it shows.
- Yeah.

1463
01:09:03,161 --> 01:09:05,598
Eat, eat, before it gets cold.

1464
01:09:05,631 --> 01:09:06,732
This looks delicious.

1465
01:09:06,765 --> 01:09:08,867
- Oh. (gasps) Oh.
- Thank you.

1466
01:09:08,901 --> 01:09:10,603
I made the sauce.

1467
01:09:10,636 --> 01:09:12,638
RYAN:
The sauce is...

1468
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,341
Mm.

1469
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:18,510
The sauce is really good.

1470
01:09:19,645 --> 01:09:21,447
- Incredible.
- SUSAN: Mm.

1471
01:09:22,648 --> 01:09:25,484
Ryan, I hear you're a doctor.

1472
01:09:25,517 --> 01:09:27,720
Your parents must be
very, very proud.

1473
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:31,724
Not really.
Uh, they wanted me to be a DJ.

1474
01:09:33,892 --> 01:09:35,628
(chuckles awkwardly)

1475
01:09:36,862 --> 01:09:39,865
(laughing)

1476
01:09:39,898 --> 01:09:41,432
He's funny.

1477
01:09:41,466 --> 01:09:43,301
- (Stanley continues laughing)
- Yeah.

1478
01:09:43,334 --> 01:09:44,536
STANLEY:
That's funny.

1479
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:46,905
You didn't say
he was funny, Cassie.

1480
01:09:46,939 --> 01:09:49,507
- Dad.
- You didn't say I was...

1481
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:52,176
- You didn't say I was funny?
- No.

1482
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:54,178
I said you were boring but rich.

1483
01:09:54,212 --> 01:09:56,314
I am boring. Not that rich.

1484
01:09:56,347 --> 01:09:57,716
- (laughter)
- No? Well, in that case,

1485
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:58,917
thanks for stopping by, kid.

1486
01:09:58,951 --> 01:10:00,284
(laughter)

1487
01:10:00,318 --> 01:10:02,520
What kind of doctoring
do you do?

1488
01:10:02,553 --> 01:10:04,857
Uh, pediatric, so...

1489
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:06,658
children.

1490
01:10:06,692 --> 01:10:08,226
What was your, uh...

1491
01:10:08,259 --> 01:10:10,729
What was that doctor's name?
Cassie's doctor.

1492
01:10:10,763 --> 01:10:13,197
- Gary?
- Um, no.

1493
01:10:13,231 --> 01:10:15,333
Dr. Katzen-something.

1494
01:10:15,366 --> 01:10:17,568
CASSANDRA:
Yeah. Dad, he was like 80.

1495
01:10:17,602 --> 01:10:18,904
Yeah, well...

1496
01:10:18,937 --> 01:10:20,773
You-you don't know
Dr. Katzen...?

1497
01:10:20,806 --> 01:10:21,907
No.

1498
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:23,408
SUSAN:
Now, I'm-I'm confused.

1499
01:10:23,441 --> 01:10:27,545
Are there different parts
of the body on a child?

1500
01:10:27,578 --> 01:10:29,848
No, it's pretty much
the same thing.

1501
01:10:29,882 --> 01:10:30,983
You're just...

1502
01:10:31,016 --> 01:10:33,251
You know, different-colored
Band-Aids and things.

1503
01:10:33,284 --> 01:10:36,254
It's not brain surgery.
(chuckles softly)

1504
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,655
- Well...
- (laughs)

1505
01:10:37,689 --> 01:10:40,358
I get it. Yeah.

1506
01:10:40,391 --> 01:10:41,826
- Oh.
- (chuckles)

1507
01:10:41,859 --> 01:10:44,295
This sauce is
absolutely unbelievable.

1508
01:10:44,328 --> 01:10:46,297
(laughing quietly)

1509
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:47,699
SUSAN:
Night, you two.

1510
01:10:47,732 --> 01:10:49,400
CASSANDRA:
Night.

1511
01:10:53,905 --> 01:10:56,641
Thanks for
introducing us to Ryan.

1512
01:10:59,044 --> 01:11:00,812
I know it was hard.

1513
01:11:02,047 --> 01:11:04,482
You know, your mom, she's...

1514
01:11:04,515 --> 01:11:10,354
(chuckles): Well, I mean,
we're both so glad that, uh...

1515
01:11:11,022 --> 01:11:12,490
Oh, my God, Dad.

1516
01:11:12,523 --> 01:11:13,991
(chuckles):
He's not that nice.

1517
01:11:14,025 --> 01:11:16,260
(laughs):
Yeah.

1518
01:11:16,294 --> 01:11:19,297
Yeah, I must be tired.

1519
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:21,499
(sighs):
Okay.

1520
01:11:24,035 --> 01:11:28,740
Honey, Nina was like
a daughter to us.

1521
01:11:28,773 --> 01:11:30,341
You know that.

1522
01:11:30,374 --> 01:11:32,577
We really miss her.

1523
01:11:33,978 --> 01:11:36,848
(sighs)
But, God, we have missed you.

1524
01:11:41,052 --> 01:11:43,020
See you tomorrow.

1525
01:11:43,054 --> 01:11:45,757
(sighs, chuckles)

1526
01:11:53,064 --> 01:11:55,800
RYAN: <i>Your mom...
oh, your mom is hot.</i>

1527
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:57,034
- Sorry.
- (laughing)

1528
01:11:57,068 --> 01:12:00,071
(chuckles):
Your mom is extremely hot.

1529
01:12:00,104 --> 01:12:02,339
Do you want her number?

1530
01:12:03,074 --> 01:12:04,976
- I could hook you up.
- Really?

1531
01:12:05,009 --> 01:12:06,376
Ooh.

1532
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:08,311
I think she likes you
more than I do.

1533
01:12:08,345 --> 01:12:10,548
Well, I hope that's not true.

1534
01:12:12,917 --> 01:12:15,285
Can I... Mm.

1535
01:12:16,087 --> 01:12:18,055
Can I tell you something?

1536
01:12:18,089 --> 01:12:19,857
Sure.

1537
01:12:22,392 --> 01:12:24,394
I think you're amazing. I...

1538
01:12:24,427 --> 01:12:26,531
- Oh, no, Ryan.
- Just shut up, you stupid bitch.

1539
01:12:26,564 --> 01:12:27,932
- Please don't.
- Shh. I...

1540
01:12:27,965 --> 01:12:29,867
- Just take this, please.
- Mm-hmm.

1541
01:12:29,901 --> 01:12:32,036
I think you're incredible. I...

1542
01:12:32,069 --> 01:12:34,639
I'm... (sighs)

1543
01:12:34,672 --> 01:12:38,408
I'm-I'm... I think
I'm falling in love with you.

1544
01:12:42,713 --> 01:12:45,716
I think I'm falling
in love with you, too.

1545
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:46,416
(softly):
Yes.

1546
01:12:46,449 --> 01:12:47,919
- Oh, my God.
- Don't make...

1547
01:12:47,952 --> 01:12:49,519
- Oh, my.
- Don't make a thing of it.

1548
01:12:49,553 --> 01:12:51,421
- I'm gonna buy you a bicycle.
- No.

1549
01:12:51,454 --> 01:12:53,691
- I want to buy you a bicycle.
- Ryan, be cool.

1550
01:12:53,724 --> 01:12:55,392
I'm cool.

1551
01:12:56,459 --> 01:12:58,129
- (whispers): I'm so cool.
- (laughing)

1552
01:12:58,162 --> 01:13:00,530
Oh, I'm the coolest.

1553
01:13:00,564 --> 01:13:02,900
(humming "Stars Are Blind")

1554
01:13:06,603 --> 01:13:07,839
Cassie.

1555
01:13:07,872 --> 01:13:10,107
Shit.

1556
01:13:10,141 --> 01:13:12,375
Madison,
what are you doing here?

1557
01:13:12,409 --> 01:13:13,911
Sorry. I, um...

1558
01:13:13,945 --> 01:13:15,512
I tried calling.

1559
01:13:15,545 --> 01:13:18,049
I left messages
about, uh, that guy.

1560
01:13:18,082 --> 01:13:19,716
Your friend.

1561
01:13:19,749 --> 01:13:22,619
Um, I don't know if-if your
phone number wasn't working.

1562
01:13:22,652 --> 01:13:24,654
Maybe I had an old one.
I just... I mean...

1563
01:13:24,688 --> 01:13:27,524
I know it seems kind of crazy,
me waiting on your porch

1564
01:13:27,557 --> 01:13:29,559
like some kind of stalker
or something.

1565
01:13:29,593 --> 01:13:31,494
Madison, I'm sorry.
I should've called you back.

1566
01:13:31,528 --> 01:13:34,865
Nothing happened with that guy.
Please believe me.

1567
01:13:34,898 --> 01:13:37,634
Are you sure? I...
But it seemed like...

1568
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:40,171
I know what it seemed like,
but it wasn't.

1569
01:13:40,204 --> 01:13:41,838
He didn't touch you.

1570
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,475
(sighs):
Oh, thank God.

1571
01:13:45,508 --> 01:13:47,944
(sobs):
Oh.

1572
01:13:47,978 --> 01:13:49,579
(sniffles)

1573
01:13:49,613 --> 01:13:52,515
Oh, I was...
I was so worried that, um...

1574
01:13:52,549 --> 01:13:54,118
that I... that he and I, um...

1575
01:13:54,151 --> 01:13:55,919
He just put you in bed.

1576
01:13:55,952 --> 01:13:58,688
Kept an eye on you
to make sure you were okay.

1577
01:13:58,722 --> 01:14:01,024
I'm really sorry
I didn't call you back.

1578
01:14:01,057 --> 01:14:02,993
It wasn't nice.

1579
01:14:03,026 --> 01:14:04,494
Yeah, well...

1580
01:14:04,527 --> 01:14:06,763
God. Look, there...

1581
01:14:06,796 --> 01:14:08,132
(sighs)

1582
01:14:08,165 --> 01:14:09,933
I need to show you something.

1583
01:14:09,966 --> 01:14:12,102
Okay.

1584
01:14:12,136 --> 01:14:14,404
Can we go inside?

1585
01:14:16,006 --> 01:14:17,974
Yeah.

1586
01:14:24,814 --> 01:14:27,717
Do you want a glass of water
or something?

1587
01:14:27,751 --> 01:14:29,619
No, thank you.

1588
01:14:43,066 --> 01:14:44,234
Oh.

1589
01:14:44,267 --> 01:14:48,571
After we had lunch and...

1590
01:14:48,605 --> 01:14:52,609
I got so drunk and woke up
in a hotel room with that guy,

1591
01:14:52,642 --> 01:14:55,979
um, I thought about it.

1592
01:14:56,012 --> 01:14:58,214
About what you said about Nina.

1593
01:14:58,248 --> 01:15:01,551
And how we all
just acted like...

1594
01:15:06,723 --> 01:15:09,893
And I remembered something.

1595
01:15:09,926 --> 01:15:11,594
What?

1596
01:15:15,131 --> 01:15:16,533
What?

1597
01:15:18,068 --> 01:15:19,936
There was a tape.

1598
01:15:24,107 --> 01:15:26,109
- What?
- A stupid video.

1599
01:15:26,142 --> 01:15:28,211
It just got sent around.

1600
01:15:28,244 --> 01:15:29,846
I got sent it.

1601
01:15:29,879 --> 01:15:31,815
Everyone did.
At the time, it was...

1602
01:15:32,682 --> 01:15:34,818
It was just gossip, you know?

1603
01:15:34,851 --> 01:15:36,618
Gossip?

1604
01:15:38,154 --> 01:15:42,759
So much stuff happened
back then, like, all the time.

1605
01:15:42,792 --> 01:15:44,260
You know what it was like.

1606
01:15:44,294 --> 01:15:46,196
It was just one blackout
after the next.

1607
01:15:46,229 --> 01:15:49,099
I-I hoped I'd imagined it.

1608
01:15:49,132 --> 01:15:50,934
But, um...

1609
01:15:53,937 --> 01:15:56,840
I always saved all my phones
for photos or whatever.

1610
01:15:56,873 --> 01:15:59,042
So, um...

1611
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:02,846
Here.

1612
01:16:02,879 --> 01:16:06,548
I don't know how we all could
have watched it and, um...

1613
01:16:08,918 --> 01:16:10,519
What?

1614
01:16:11,187 --> 01:16:13,589
Thought it was funny.

1615
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,229
You can have the phone, okay?

1616
01:16:19,262 --> 01:16:22,698
You don't have to watch it.
I really wouldn't watch it.

1617
01:16:22,731 --> 01:16:25,035
But, um, I don't know,
do whatever you want with it.

1618
01:16:25,068 --> 01:16:27,803
Just leave me out of it.

1619
01:16:27,836 --> 01:16:29,671
And...

1620
01:16:29,705 --> 01:16:32,008
please, will you do me a favor?

1621
01:16:33,942 --> 01:16:35,111

about it very carefully.

Al Monroe's bachelor party is.

What?

Things have changed so much

1714
01:20:57,938 --> 01:20:59,173
since we were at school,
haven't they?

1715
01:20:59,206 --> 01:21:00,408
Think about this, please.
Please.

1716
01:21:00,441 --> 01:21:05,279
I cannot begin to tell you
how much I've thought about it.

I'm a bad person.

You got to forgive me.

I can't...

1734

Are you gonna tell everybody?

1735
01:22:02,002 --> 01:22:03,404
I don't know.

1736
01:22:03,437 --> 01:22:04,605

Yeah.

1742
01:22:17,318 --> 01:22:20,254
Don't tell any of them
that I'm coming,

1743
01:22:20,287 --> 01:22:23,090
'cause I'll send the video
around just the same if you do.

1744

And then we both
won't be doctors,

01:24:49,168 --> 01:24:50,336
(others groaning)

1765
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:52,272
All right, who ordered her?

1766
01:24:52,305 --> 01:24:53,806
- Joe?
- Don't look at me.

1767
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:56,276
(chuckles)
No one's owning up?

1768
01:24:56,309 --> 01:24:58,111
All right, well, when Anastasia
finds out, it's your fucking

1769
01:24:58,144 --> 01:24:59,479
- funeral, you hear me?
- Get out of here.

1770
01:24:59,512 --> 01:25:01,447
- (laughter)
- I take it you're the groom?

1771
01:25:01,481 --> 01:25:03,149
Yeah.

1772
01:25:03,182 --> 01:25:04,350
(men whooping)

1773
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:06,386
- Then sit the fuck down.
- (laughter, yelling)

1774
01:25:06,419 --> 01:25:07,820
Oh, shit!

1775
01:25:07,854 --> 01:25:09,689
Now.

1776
01:25:09,722 --> 01:25:12,825
I'm gonna need you all
to kneel down in front of me

1777
01:25:12,859 --> 01:25:15,128
like the naughty boys you are.

1778
01:25:15,161 --> 01:25:16,829
- MEN: Oh...
- JOE: Come on, come on.

1779
01:25:16,863 --> 01:25:18,565
(laughter)

1780
01:25:18,598 --> 01:25:20,700
Everybody here?

1781
01:25:20,733 --> 01:25:22,468
I don't want anyone to miss out.

1782
01:25:22,502 --> 01:25:25,438
Oh, yeah. All the patients
are accounted for, Nurse.

Time to go upstairs.

1799
01:26:14,954 --> 01:26:18,858
No, it's okay.
I don't, uh, w-want to.

1800
01:26:18,891 --> 01:26:20,627
Look, I don't
have to do anything

1801
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:21,894
if you don't want me to,

1802
01:26:21,928 --> 01:26:25,263
but I only get paid
if I go upstairs with you.

1803
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:29,167
(sighs) Okay.

1804
01:26:29,201 --> 01:26:31,536
- Okay, you guys.
- (cheering)

1805
01:26:33,305 --> 01:26:35,908
JOE: I better see her crawling
out of here in the morning!

1806
01:26:35,942 --> 01:26:37,877
She better not be able to walk!

1807
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:39,912
Leave some for us, man!

1808
01:26:39,946 --> 01:26:40,980
(door opens)

1809
01:26:41,014 --> 01:26:42,547

dance music playing downstairs)

1810
01:26:42,581 --> 01:26:43,650
(door closes)

1811
01:26:43,683 --> 01:26:45,685
Uh, so what do I, uh...

1812
01:26:45,718 --> 01:26:47,619
Get on the bed.

1813
01:26:47,653 --> 01:26:48,855
Okay.

1814
01:26:48,888 --> 01:26:50,322
I'm a little scared of you.

1815
01:26:50,355 --> 01:26:52,759
You don't need to be scared.
Get on the bed.

1816
01:26:52,792 --> 01:26:55,928
(grunting):
All right.

1817
01:26:55,962 --> 01:26:57,797
Oh! Uh, no, no, no. Sorry.

1818
01:26:57,830 --> 01:26:58,865
I-I'm not sure about that.

1819
01:26:58,898 --> 01:27:01,600
It's for my safety.
When I give private dances,

1820
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:03,735
guys can get
a little handsy, so...

1821
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:05,637
Oh, right. Yeah, of course.

1822
01:27:05,671 --> 01:27:08,507
(chuckling)

1823
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:11,543
You know, you don't...
you don't need to...

1824
01:27:11,576 --> 01:27:12,812
I'm a gentleman.

1825
01:27:12,845 --> 01:27:14,613
- Are you? (laughs)
- Yeah.

1826
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:17,582
You might be surprised
to hear that gentlemen

1827
01:27:17,616 --> 01:27:18,951
are sometimes the worst.

1828
01:27:18,985 --> 01:27:20,552
Ow. Oh.

1829
01:27:20,585 --> 01:27:22,754
Sorry, can you, uh...
can you loosen these a little?

1830
01:27:22,788 --> 01:27:25,691
- You'll get used to it.
- Ooh.

1831
01:27:25,724 --> 01:27:27,526
(chuckles)

1832
01:27:27,559 --> 01:27:29,761
Look, I-I don't want to sound
like a pussy,

1833
01:27:29,795 --> 01:27:33,598
but y-you're not... you're not
gonna do anything, are you?

1834
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:36,835
It's just... I love my fiancée,

1835
01:27:36,868 --> 01:27:38,403
- and we're getting married.
- Aw.

1836
01:27:38,437 --> 01:27:40,405
- So I-I don't want any, uh...
- (chuckles)

1837
01:27:40,439 --> 01:27:42,841
Hey, do I look like someone
who would make you

1838
01:27:42,874 --> 01:27:44,976
do something
you don't want to do?

1839
01:27:45,011 --> 01:27:47,679
- No.
- Exactly.

1840
01:27:47,713 --> 01:27:49,448
(chuckles, snorts)

1841
01:27:49,481 --> 01:27:51,616
Ay.

1842
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:53,618
So, what's your name?

1843
01:27:53,652 --> 01:27:54,653
Candy.

1844
01:27:55,887 --> 01:27:58,590
- I mean your real name.
- Nina.

1845
01:27:58,623 --> 01:28:00,225
Nina Fisher.

1846
01:28:01,993 --> 01:28:03,962
What did you say?

1847
01:28:03,995 --> 01:28:06,231
I said my name is Nina Fisher.

1848
01:28:07,065 --> 01:28:08,934
Can you let me go, please?

1849
01:28:08,967 --> 01:28:10,302
I'm sorry, I can't.

1850
01:28:10,335 --> 01:28:11,803
Did one of the guys
put you up to this?

1851
01:28:11,837 --> 01:28:13,338
Was it Joe?

1852
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:15,807
Jesus Christ, that was dark,
even for him.

1853
01:28:15,841 --> 01:28:16,975
I don't follow.

1854
01:28:17,008 --> 01:28:19,010
- You're not Nina Fisher.
- Why not?

1855
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:22,013
(sighs)
Because she's dead, okay?

1856
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:23,482
Must be another Nina Fisher.

1857
01:28:23,515 --> 01:28:24,449
- A coincidence.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

1858
01:28:24,483 --> 01:28:26,351
Hey, can you let me
out of these, please?

1859
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:27,285
This isn't funny.

1860
01:28:27,319 --> 01:28:29,321
Why would I give you
a dead girl's name?

1861
01:28:29,354 --> 01:28:32,357
Hey, this is fucked up, okay?
Stop.

1862
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:34,826
But I'm not doing anything.

1863
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:36,293
Guys! Hey, Joe?

1864
01:28:36,328 --> 01:28:37,496
Br-Brandon, Chip.
Hey, guys.

1865
01:28:37,529 --> 01:28:39,765
Can you get up here, please?

1866
01:28:41,466 --> 01:28:43,435
I don't think they can hear you.

1867
01:28:43,468 --> 01:28:46,905
And even if they could,
they're all passed out by now.

1868
01:28:46,938 --> 01:28:50,341
'Cause if there is one thing
I learned at Forrest,

1869
01:28:50,374 --> 01:28:54,411
it's how easy it is
to slip something into a drink.

1870
01:28:54,446 --> 01:28:56,882
You'd think they'd
remember that, especially Joe.

1871
01:28:56,915 --> 01:28:59,316
♪ ♪

1872
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:00,652
Do I know you?

1873
01:29:00,685 --> 01:29:02,788
I'm not sure
you would remember me, Al.

1874
01:29:02,821 --> 01:29:05,490
You were so popular.

1875
01:29:10,028 --> 01:29:12,063
You're Nina's friend.

1876
01:29:12,097 --> 01:29:13,430
Fuck!

1877
01:29:13,464 --> 01:29:14,833
You're Nina's friend.

1878
01:29:14,866 --> 01:29:17,002
So you did notice me after all.

1879
01:29:17,035 --> 01:29:18,536
I'm surprised.

1880
01:29:18,570 --> 01:29:20,504
I wasn't super fuckable
back then,

1881
01:29:20,538 --> 01:29:22,406
so I thought I kind of
slipped your attention.

1882
01:29:22,439 --> 01:29:23,942
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh... (sighs)
What do you want?

1883
01:29:23,975 --> 01:29:25,610
Money?
You blackmailing me?

1884
01:29:25,644 --> 01:29:29,313
I want you to tell me
what you did.

1885
01:29:30,548 --> 01:29:33,417
Are y...
are you talking about...

1886
01:29:33,450 --> 01:29:34,953
What do you think
I'm talking about?

1887
01:29:34,986 --> 01:29:36,087
I didn't do anything!

1888
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:37,689
W-We were kids.

1889
01:29:37,722 --> 01:29:39,925
Oh, if I hear that
one more time.

1890
01:29:39,958 --> 01:29:41,425
Look...
(stammers, sighs)

1891
01:29:41,458 --> 01:29:42,861
Maybe she regretted it after,
okay?

1892
01:29:42,894 --> 01:29:45,596
- Oh, yeah, she regretted it.
- I didn't do anything!

1893
01:29:45,629 --> 01:29:46,832
- Wrong!
- What the fuck...

1894
01:29:46,865 --> 01:29:48,499
Look, I... (chuckles)

1895
01:29:48,532 --> 01:29:50,734
I don't know what
you want me to say, okay,

1896
01:29:50,769 --> 01:29:52,670
b-b-but we-we did not...

1897
01:29:55,739 --> 01:29:56,942
What?

1898
01:29:56,975 --> 01:29:58,776
You know.

1899
01:30:00,145 --> 01:30:01,445
No.

1900
01:30:01,478 --> 01:30:03,114
She could barely
hold her head up.

1901
01:30:03,148 --> 01:30:04,950
She had no idea
what was going on.

1902
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:06,151
It was a fucking party.

1903
01:30:06,184 --> 01:30:08,053
I-I mean, yeah, look,
we were all drunk,

1904
01:30:08,086 --> 01:30:09,854
of course,
but-but-but she was into it.

1905
01:30:09,888 --> 01:30:13,357
Didn't look like she was
into it on the video.

1906
01:30:14,692 --> 01:30:15,961
What video?

1907
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:17,795
Oh, you don't remember?

1908
01:30:17,828 --> 01:30:19,663
Your friend Joe taped it.

1909
01:30:19,697 --> 01:30:22,433
Let me tell you, that party
does not look so good

1910
01:30:22,466 --> 01:30:24,468
in the cold light of day.

1911
01:30:25,502 --> 01:30:29,007
Look, I'll-I'll give you
anything, okay?

1912
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:30,808
I mean, I'll-I'll do anything.

1913
01:30:30,841 --> 01:30:32,010
Anything.

1914
01:30:32,043 --> 01:30:33,844
Aw. Don't cry.

1915
01:30:33,878 --> 01:30:35,613
Really, don't fucking cry.

1916
01:30:35,646 --> 01:30:37,581
Tell me what you did.

1917
01:30:37,615 --> 01:30:39,016
I didn't do anything wrong,
though!

1918
01:30:39,050 --> 01:30:41,018
She dropped out.

1919
01:30:41,051 --> 01:30:43,888
Top of her class,
and she dropped out.

1920
01:30:43,921 --> 01:30:45,756
I did, too, to take care of her.

1921
01:30:45,789 --> 01:30:47,691
- The two of us gone.
- (sobs softly)

1922
01:30:47,725 --> 01:30:49,927
You graduated
magna cum laude, though.

1923
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,629
Did you ever feel guilty,

1924
01:30:51,662 --> 01:30:53,497
or did you just feel relieved
that she'd gone?

1925
01:30:53,530 --> 01:30:55,032
You know, I was affected
by it, too, okay?

1926
01:30:55,065 --> 01:30:56,467
I mean, it's every guy's
worst nightmare,

1927
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:57,568
getting accused like that.

1928
01:30:57,601 --> 01:31:01,538
Can you guess what every woman's
worst nightmare is?

1929
01:31:03,941 --> 01:31:06,977
The thing is you thought
you'd gotten away with it

1930
01:31:07,011 --> 01:31:08,646
because everyone had forgotten.

1931
01:31:08,679 --> 01:31:11,148
- Fuck.
- But I haven't.

1932
01:31:11,181 --> 01:31:14,652
You're out of your fucking mind!

1933
01:31:14,685 --> 01:31:17,221
I was so sad to leave, you know?

1934
01:31:17,254 --> 01:31:20,491
I wanted to be a doctor
my whole life.

1935
01:31:20,524 --> 01:31:23,193
But lately,
I've been feeling like...

1936
01:31:23,227 --> 01:31:25,429
I might want to get
back into it.

1937
01:31:26,096 --> 01:31:27,631
Stop.

1938
01:31:27,665 --> 01:31:29,867
- You know...
- Please. Please stop. Hey.

1939
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:31,201
Nina was extraordinary.

1940
01:31:31,235 --> 01:31:32,670
So smart.

1941
01:31:32,703 --> 01:31:34,204
- (chuckles)
- Help!

1942
01:31:34,238 --> 01:31:35,539
- Weirdly smart.
- (instruments scraping)

1943
01:31:35,572 --> 01:31:37,741
Help! Help me!

1944
01:31:37,775 --> 01:31:38,676
Fuck!

1945
01:31:38,709 --> 01:31:40,811
- (shushing)
- Help me! (sobs)

1946
01:31:40,844 --> 01:31:43,013
I want you to know
what she was like, okay?

1947
01:31:43,047 --> 01:31:44,214
(crying):
Come on.

1948
01:31:44,248 --> 01:31:45,683
She's just so difficult
to explain,

1949
01:31:45,716 --> 01:31:47,251
'cause she was just
so completely herself.

1950
01:31:47,284 --> 01:31:50,453
Even when she was
four years old.

1951
01:31:51,855 --> 01:31:55,259
She was fully formed
from day one.

1952
01:31:55,292 --> 01:31:59,129
Same face. Same walk.

1953
01:31:59,163 --> 01:32:01,098
And funny.

1954
01:32:01,131 --> 01:32:02,498
Like a grown-up is funny.

1955
01:32:02,532 --> 01:32:04,868
- Kind of shrewd.
- (crying)

1956
01:32:05,736 --> 01:32:07,805
I was just in awe of her.

1957
01:32:07,838 --> 01:32:10,274
I couldn't believe
she wanted to be my friend.

1958
01:32:10,307 --> 01:32:13,277
She didn't give a fuck
what anyone else thought,

1959
01:32:13,310 --> 01:32:17,147
apart from me,
'cause she was just...

1960
01:32:17,181 --> 01:32:19,582
Nina.

1961
01:32:22,052 --> 01:32:24,587
And then she wasn't.

1962
01:32:25,756 --> 01:32:28,292
Suddenly,
she was something else.

1963
01:32:28,325 --> 01:32:29,960
She was yours.

1964
01:32:29,994 --> 01:32:31,161
(whimpers, gasps)

1965
01:32:31,195 --> 01:32:34,564
It wasn't her name she heard
when she was walking around.

1966
01:32:34,597 --> 01:32:36,566
- It was yours.
- (sobs softly)

1967
01:32:36,599 --> 01:32:40,270
Your name all around her.

1968
01:32:40,304 --> 01:32:43,240
All over her all the time.

1969
01:32:43,273 --> 01:32:45,641
And it just...

1970
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:49,880
...squeezed her out.

1971
01:32:50,914 --> 01:32:52,648
(panting, sobbing)

1972
01:32:52,682 --> 01:32:55,319
So, when I heard
your name again...

1973
01:32:55,352 --> 01:32:59,622
your filthy fucking name...

1974
01:32:59,655 --> 01:33:04,328
I wondered, when was the last
time anyone had said hers?

1975
01:33:04,361 --> 01:33:06,263
Or thought it, even?

1976
01:33:06,296 --> 01:33:08,298
Apart from me.

1977
01:33:08,332 --> 01:33:12,835
And it made me so sad
because, Al...

1978
01:33:12,869 --> 01:33:17,840
you should be the one
with her name all over you.

No. No.

Don't worry.
I've sterilized everything.

1981

- No.
- I really would have been a great doctor.

1982
01:33:24,947 --> 01:33:26,582
- You're insane.
- (laughing): You know what?

1983
01:33:26,616 --> 01:33:28,185
I honestly don't think I am.

It's gonna be fine, all right?

2083
01:39:20,568 --> 01:39:23,538
We're gonna take care of this.

2084
01:39:23,571 --> 01:39:25,340
We just got to get rid
of the body

2085

SUSAN:
<i>Can't you just</i>

2110
01:40:54,863 --> 01:40:58,332
do that thing where you track
her cell phone or something?

2111
01:40:58,365 --> 01:40:59,633
I'm sorry, ma'am.

2112
01:40:59,666 --> 01:41:02,336
It was turned off
before she left.

2113
01:41:02,369 --> 01:41:04,505
Seems like she really
didn't want anyone

2114
01:41:04,538 --> 01:41:06,273
to know where she was.

2115
01:41:06,306 --> 01:41:08,208
(sighs)
But it-it's...

2116
01:41:08,242 --> 01:41:10,244
it's just not like her
to disappear like this.

2117
01:41:10,277 --> 01:41:12,412
Well, that's not
entirely true, honey.

2118
01:41:12,446 --> 01:41:14,248
Stanley.

2119
01:41:14,281 --> 01:41:17,818
I... You know, she's...

2120
01:41:17,851 --> 01:41:20,053
she was getting better.

2121
01:41:20,087 --> 01:41:21,588
She was, really.

2122
01:41:21,622 --> 01:41:23,657
- She was getting better.
- STANLEY: Yes, she was.

2123
01:41:23,690 --> 01:41:25,626
She... Of course she was.

2124
01:41:25,659 --> 01:41:27,728
She'll come back.

2125
01:41:27,761 --> 01:41:29,530
You know how she is.

2126
01:41:29,563 --> 01:41:31,164
She always comes back.

2127
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:32,799
Was she seeing anyone?

2128
01:41:32,833 --> 01:41:35,135
Did she have a boyfriend?

That's very commendable.

2139

Thank you for all that you do
for the community.

2140
01:42:00,494 --> 01:42:02,128
Sure. Yeah.

2141
01:42:02,162 --> 01:42:05,097
I'm sorry to bother you
at work, Doctor.

2142
01:42:05,131 --> 01:42:07,634
Do you know a Cassandra Thomas?

2143
01:42:09,369 --> 01:42:10,771
Yeah. Yes.

2144
01:42:10,804 --> 01:42:12,104
(clears throat) Yes.

2145
01:42:12,138 --> 01:42:14,274
- How do you know her?
- We were...

2146
01:42:15,742 --> 01:42:18,177
We were seeing each other.

2147
01:42:18,210 --> 01:42:20,179
Were seeing each other?

2148
01:42:20,212 --> 01:42:22,716
We broke up a few days ago.

2149
01:42:22,749 --> 01:42:24,585
Define "a few days."

2150
01:42:25,619 --> 01:42:26,853
Last Thursday.

2151
01:42:26,887 --> 01:42:30,189
Have you had any contact since?

2152
01:42:30,222 --> 01:42:32,492
No. I'm sorry,
what is this regarding?

2153
01:42:32,526 --> 01:42:35,829
Cassandra's parents have filed
a missing persons report.

2154
01:42:35,862 --> 01:42:37,598
I'm sorry, what?

2155
01:42:37,631 --> 01:42:38,832
Why?

2156
01:42:38,865 --> 01:42:41,568
Because she's missing.

2157
01:42:41,602 --> 01:42:44,136
Since when?

2158
01:42:44,170 --> 01:42:45,505
Since Friday.

2159
01:42:45,539 --> 01:42:47,641
She told her parents
something about a work trip,

2160
01:42:47,674 --> 01:42:49,910
but her colleague didn't know
anything about it.

2161
01:42:49,943 --> 01:42:52,244
Do you have any idea
where she might have been

2162
01:42:52,278 --> 01:42:54,413
going to this weekend?

2163
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:59,653
She mentioned, uh,
the work trip.

2164
01:42:59,686 --> 01:43:02,221
- Yeah.
- Any idea where?

2165
01:43:04,256 --> 01:43:07,594
(sighs) N-No. No.

2166
01:43:07,628 --> 01:43:10,262
I'm sorry.

2167
01:43:10,296 --> 01:43:11,932
That's all right, Doc.

2168
01:43:11,965 --> 01:43:13,900
Between you and me, it, uh,

2169
01:43:13,934 --> 01:43:16,569
sounded like she wasn't
feeling so good.

2170
01:43:16,603 --> 01:43:18,204
Mentally, I mean.

2171
01:43:18,237 --> 01:43:21,540
Her father seemed to think
she was a little unstable.

2172
01:43:23,275 --> 01:43:25,846
Yeah, she was...

2173
01:43:25,879 --> 01:43:29,348
not in a good place.

2174
01:43:31,350 --> 01:43:35,287
Do you think she might have
wanted to hurt herself?

2175
01:43:39,458 --> 01:43:40,626
Yeah.

2176
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:43,262
Uh, she could've.

2177
01:43:43,295 --> 01:43:45,364
She could've, yeah.

2178
01:43:45,398 --> 01:43:48,267
I thought that might
be the case.

2179
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:50,469
Thank you for your honesty.

2180
01:43:50,503 --> 01:43:52,371
Well, I don't want
to bother you anymore,

2181
01:43:52,405 --> 01:43:54,440
but if you wouldn't mind coming
to the station tomorrow,

2182
01:43:54,473 --> 01:43:55,842
you know,
for an official statement.

2183
01:43:55,876 --> 01:43:57,844
Of course.
Anything I can do to help.

2184
01:43:57,878 --> 01:43:59,245
Thank you for your time,
Doctor.

2185
01:43:59,278 --> 01:44:01,313
- Appreciate it.
- Thank you.

2186
01:44:01,347 --> 01:44:02,848

Anastasia, you're the greatest
thing that ever happened to me.

You are my moral compass

ANASTASIA:
Al, you are my best friend

Al's like a brother to me.

We grew up together. We're...

2197
01:44:34,947 --> 01:44:36,248
We're the best of friends.

2198
01:44:36,282 --> 01:44:37,550
We've been through
thick and thin.

2199
01:44:37,583 --> 01:44:40,586

- And-and I just love him.

01:44:40,619 --> 01:44:43,422
And, you know,
he's met Anastasia, who,

2201
01:44:43,456 --> 01:44:46,726
by all accounts, is,
you know, just a solid catch.

See that bridesmaid over there?

2208
01:45:03,442 --> 01:45:05,411
Whew. Just the type of girl
that makes you

2209

go home to your wife

You know she trained
at Cirque du Soleil?

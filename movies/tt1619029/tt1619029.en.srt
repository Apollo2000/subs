2
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,238
Mrs. Kennedy?

3
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,591
They told me to come up.

4
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,553
And I'm so sorry
for your loss.

5
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,628
Have you read
what they've been writing?

6
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,634
Krock and Merriman
and all the rest?

7
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,758
Yes, I have.

8
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,629
Merriman is such
a bitter man.

9
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,558
It's been just one week.

10
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,632
Already they're treating him
like some dusty old artifact,

11
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,113
to be shelved away.

12
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,556
That's no way
to be remembered.

13
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,154
And how would you like him remembered,
Mrs. Kennedy?

14
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,315
I...

15
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,116
You understand that I will be
editing this conversation?

16
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,954
Just in case I don't say
exactly what I mean.

17
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,429
With all due respect,

18
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,829
that seems very unlikely,
Mrs. Kennedy.

19
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,558
Right.
Okay. Uh...

20
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,829
So, this will be your own
version of what happened?

21
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,953
Exactly.

22
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,313
Come in.

23
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,676
I thought it was
another backfire.

24
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,909
I very nearly didn't go.
What if I'd been here

25
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,349
or out riding
in Virginia somewhere?

26
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,551
Thank God
I was with him.

27
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,517
Why, "Thank God"?

28
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,909
Do you know what
I think of history?

29
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,232
Of history?

30
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,432
I've read a great deal.
More than people realize.

31
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,073
The more I read,
the more I wonder...

32
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,474
When something
is written down,

33
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,516
does that make it true?

34
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,995
It's all that
we have.

35
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,160
Had.

36
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,798
We have television now.

37
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,394
At least people can see
for their own eyes.

38
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,600
That tour of
the White House

39
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,557
that you did a couple
of years ago for CBS,

40
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,353
I always assumed
that you did that for

41
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,635
a purpose? No?
After the fashion magazines?

42
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,869
You even won an Emmy.

43
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,312
I didn't do that
program for me.

44
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,914
I did it for
the American people.

45
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,439
That program was
my first glimpse

46
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
into the White House

47
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,034
and, for whatever it's worth,
I thought you were excellent.

48
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,394
Very poised.
Oh, thank you.

49
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,239
You could have had a career
as a broadcaster, I'm sure.

50
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,515
What?

51
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,549
I'm sorry?

52
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,959
What did you say?

53
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,874
I said you could have
a career...

54
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,712
Could have had a career
as a broadcaster.

55
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,756
Are you giving me
professional advice?

56
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,272
I'm

57
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,434
not.

58
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,472
But I am sure that the whole
country would like to know

59
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,760
what you're going to do next.

60
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,998
I can assure you,
not television.

61
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,629
Welcome to the White House.

62
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,516
Welcome to the White House.

63
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,909
We're so proud
to call it home.

64
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,398
Why don't you try,
"The People's House"?

65
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,391
Make it more personal.

66
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,870
Welcome to
The People's House.

67
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,315
We're so proud
to call it home.

68
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,629
Better?

69
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,836
When will Jack join us?

70
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,996
They want to
hear from you.

71
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,712
They think I'm a fool.

72
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,950
One year in office,
wasting their money.

73
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,469
That's why you need to show
them what you've done.

74
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,316
The President will join
you in the Monroe Room

75
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,793
at the end
of the tour.

76
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,958
You'll be great.

77
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,517
Stay close.
Of course.

78
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,310
You look beautiful. Go.

79
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,158
Hello.
Excuse me.

80
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,496
This is the White House

81
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,670
as seen from its South Lawn.

82
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,552
For the next hour,
Mrs. John F. Kennedy

83
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,030
invites you to visit
the President's House

84
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,752
and see some
of the restorations

85
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,478
she's made in its interior.

86
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,078
Mrs. John F. Kennedy,

87
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,318
third-youngest of the 29 wives
to live in the White House.

88
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,231
Mrs. Kennedy,
I want to thank you

89
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,954
for letting us visit
your official home.

90
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,393
This is obviously
the room

91
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,829
from which much of your
work on it is directed.

92
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,071
Yes, it's attic and cellar
all in one.

93
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,428
Since our work started,

94
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,318
we receive hundreds
of letters every day.

95
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,274
This is where we evaluate
all the finds,

96
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,600
and see if we want
to keep them,

97
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,711
if they'll fit
into our budget.

98
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,353
Mrs. Kennedy,
every First Lady

99
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,238
and every administration since
President Madison's time,

100
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,713
has made changes,

101
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,717
greater or smaller,
in the White House.

102
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,035
Before we look at any
of the changes you've made...

103
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,355
Now, what's
your basic plan?

104
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,117
Well, I really
don't have one.

105
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,518
Because I think this house
will always grow, and should.

106
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,717
It just seemed to me
such a shame

107
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,313
when we came here to find

108
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,472
hardly anything of the past
in the house.

109
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,233
Hardly anything before 1902.

110
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,794
Now suppose
that you and your committee

111
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,512
were to acquire
some of the things

112
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,352
that are in this room,

113
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,589
what happens when
the next President's wife

114
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,438
comes into
the White House?

115
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,918
Well,
if they don't want it...

116
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,314
In the past, you see,

117
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,715
they could sell it
or throw it out.

118
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,239
And the talk of the taxpayer
money being wasted?

119
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,231
Oh, I raised
every dime privately

120
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,356
that we spent
on that restoration.

121
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,158
I... I loved that house,

122
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,430
and I wanted to share it
with the American people.

123
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,632
To impart a sense
of America's greatness.

124
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,631
Objects and artifacts

125
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,069
last far longer than people,

126
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,994
and they represent
important ideas in history,

127
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,793
identity, beauty.

128
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,390
But I'm sure that, uh,
the readers would like to know

129
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,109
what it's like to be
a member of your family?

130
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,990
Imagine a little boy
surrounded by all of this.

131
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,840
Having his older brother
die in battle,

132
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,353
and then going off
to that same war

133
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,038
and coming home a hero.

134
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,435
People see
that little boy,

135
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,039
born to wealth
and privilege,

136
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,994
willing to sacrifice
everything for his ideals

137
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,031
in service
to his nation.

138
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,230
Royalty. You make him
sound like royalty.

139
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,313
Well, for royalty
you need tradition.

140
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,836
And for tradition,
you need time.

141
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,116
Well, I guess it has
to start somewhere, right?

142
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,510
There has to be a day one.

143
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,200
This is the East Room,

144
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,072
pretty much as Americans

145
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,350
have known it now
for 60 years.

146
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,799
Obviously you haven't
felt that

147
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,394
you had to make any
great changes in here.

148
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,035
No, I think it's lovely.

149
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,116
I hate to make
changes really,

150
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,589
so when you find
a room like this,

151
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,193
it's wonderful. This...

152
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,311
This piano brings to mind

153
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,550
that, uh, this is the part
of the White House

154
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,359
where you have
the musical affairs.

155
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,556
That's right. This piano was
designed by Franklin Roosevelt

156
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,033
with the eagle support.

157
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,794
And this is
the end of the room

158
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,916
where Pablo Casals
played for us,

159
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,837
where we had
a portable stage built,

160
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,717
when we had
the Shakespeare players.

161
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,513
Mrs. Kennedy,
this administration

162
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,431
has shown
a particular affinity

163
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,870
for artists, musicians,
writers, poets...

164
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,917
Is this because
you and your husband

165
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,359
just feel that way,

166
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,590
or do you think
that there's a relationship

167
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,870
between the government
and the arts?

168
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,230
That's so complicated.

169
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,157
I... I don't know.

170
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,719
I just think that everything

171
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,631
in the White House
should be the best.

172
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,238
And if it's
an American company

173
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,595
that you can help,
I like to do that.

174
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,951
If it's not...
Just as long as it's the best.

175
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,477
Is your faith helping you?

176
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,039
I'd prefer to discuss
my faith with a priest.

177
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,476
You're not a man
of the cloth, are you?

178
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,909
No. No, I'm not.

179
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,176
I'm just trying
to get to the truth.

180
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,270
That's what reporters do.
Oh, the truth.

181
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,476
Well, I've grown accustomed
to a great divide

182
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,512
between what people believe
and what I know to be real.

183
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,676
Fine. I will settle for
a story that's believable.

184
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,518
That's more like it.

185
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,554
You know, I used to be
a reporter myself once.

186
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,316
I know what
you're looking for.

187
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,789
I'm sorry?

188
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,628
A moment-by-moment account.

189
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,554
That's what you came
here for, isn't it?

190
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,513
You want me to describe
the sound the bullet made

191
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,872
when it collided
with my husband's skull.

192
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,831
I'm very happy

193
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,033
to be in the great State of Texas,

194
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,638
to be with you

195
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,558
and experience

196
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,793
the noble Spanish tradition

197
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,037
that has achieved so much in Dallas.

198
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,032
This tradition

199
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,708
started 100 years

200
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,238
before the colonization
of Massachusetts,

201
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,910
my husband's State.

202
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,712
It is all a tradition

203
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,278
that remains alive and strong.

204
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,395
Is that the sou nd of bi rds?

205
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,870
Uh, not exactly birds.

206
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,557
Must be the ocean.
Hmm.

207
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,758
You ready?
Of course.

208
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,871
I love crowds.

209
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,557
You remember Governor
and Mrs. Connally.

210
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,154
Welcome to Dallas,
darling.

211
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,834
Thank you so much
for coming.

212
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,274
Very nice to meet you.

213
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,437
My! What a welcome!

214
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,118
There'd been the biggest
motorcade from the airport.

215
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,471
Hot, wild,
like Mexico or Vienna.

216
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,638
The sun was strong
in our faces,

217
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,155
but I couldn't wear
my sunglasses.

218
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,439
Jack has his hand out,

219
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,638
and I see a piece
of his skull come off.

220
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,034
And it was flesh-colored,
it wasn't white.

221
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,918
And he slumps in my lap.

222
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,958
His blood
and his brains are in my lap.

223
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,718
And I'm saying, "Jack,

224
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,831
"Jack, can you hear me?

225
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,871
"Jack! I love you, Jack!"

226
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,553
And his head was so beautiful,

227
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,470
and his mouth was beautiful,
and his eyes were open.

228
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,670
I was trying to keep
the top of his head down.

229
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,199
Keep it all in.

230
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,518
He had the most wonderful
expression on his face,

231
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,033
you know?

232
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,435
Just before
they'd ask him a question,

233
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,198
just before he'd answer,

234
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,752
he looked puzzled.

235
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,513
I knew he was dead.

236
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,034
Mrs. Kennedy, uh...

237
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,473
Don't think
for one second

238
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,391
that I'm going to
let you publish that.

239
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,354
You understand?

240
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,748
Yes. Yes, of course.

241
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,359
Yes, I understand.

242
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,877
What did the bullet
sound like?

243
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,030
Mrs. Kennedy?

244
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,557
Are you all right?
It's Larry.

245
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,716
I'll be ready
in a moment.

246
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,556
Take all the time
you need.

247
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,637
Are they waiting?

248
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,631
"I do solemnly swear..."

249
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,711
I do solemnly swear...

250
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,637
"...that I will
faithfully execute..."

251
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,029
...that I will
faithfully execute...

252
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,277
"...the office of President
of the United States."

253
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,555
...the office of President
of the United States.

254
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,551
"And will to the best
of my ability..."

255
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,736
And will
to the best of my ability...

256
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,877
"...preserve, protect..."
...preserve, protect...

257
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,718
"...and defend..."
...and defend...

258
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,508
"...the Constitution
of the United States."

259
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,830
...the Constitution
of the United States.

260
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,713
"So help me God."

261
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,438
So help me God.

262
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,438
Mr. President.

263
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,216
Start the engines.

264
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,754
Get some of the heat
off this plane. Thank you.

265
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,719
Can you tell me
what size the bullet was?

266
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,510
I don't think
it was a.38, was it?

267
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,669
It seemed...

268
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,955
What's that called,
the caliber?

269
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,832
It seemed bigger.

270
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,712
It seemed like something
soldiers would use,

271
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,637
or maybe what they use
for deer hunting...

272
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,216
Mrs. Kennedy,
you don't have to...

273
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,390
We don't know yet.

274
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,948
We need to have
the Irish cadets.

275
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,160
I'm sorry?

276
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,272
Yes. The Irish cadets,
for the funeral.

277
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,912
Jack loved them. He saw them
perform in Dublin last summer.

278
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,816
Of course, Mrs. Kennedy.
We'll make sure of it.

279
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,229
And those bagpipers
from Scotland we just had.

280
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,918
What were they
called, Kenny?

281
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,592
The Black Watch.

282
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,398
The Black Watch.
That's right.

283
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,833
The Black Watch Pipers.

284
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,336
When we arrive,
we'll be exiting the rear of the plane.

285
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,828
You, the President...
President Johnson, that is.

286
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,995
Why the rear?

287
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,229
There's press at Andrews.

288
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,456
Not to mention
the security risk...

289
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,118
Am I supposed
to hide away? Now?

290
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Not hide.

291
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,390
Oh, I'm sure those people
would love that.

292
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,278
What do they call themselves,
The Birch Society?

293
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,876
No, I will not sneak out
the back door.

294
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,833
I will go out the usual way.
We all will.

295
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,839
I'll arrange it.

296
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,313
When we land,
Mrs. Kennedy,

297
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,674
we'll need to
proceed directly

298
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,472
to the hospital
for the autopsy.

299
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,039
The autopsy?

300
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,193
Is that necessary?

301
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,799
I'm afraid it's required.

302
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,359
By who?

303
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,873
The law, Mrs. Kennedy.

304
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,358
And what exactly
will they do?

305
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,108
I'm not sure...

306
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,670
What does an autopsy entail?
I want you to explain to me.

307
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,316
I want to hear
all the details.

308
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,312
I'm his wi...
Whatever I am now.

309
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,675
I want all the details.

310
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,352
What, will they
slice him open?

311
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,879
Darling.

312
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,835
Can I send somebody
to help you change

313
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,717
before we land?

314
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,718
All those cameras.

315
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,717
People will be watching.

316
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,398
There were wanted
posters everywhere.

317
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,919
For Jack.

318
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,235
With Jack's face on them.

319
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,189
Let them see
what they've done.

320
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,599
Jackie?

321
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,559
Bobby.

322
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,076
Sir,

323
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,031
there's a car waiting
on the tarmac

324
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,634
to take you and Mrs. Kennedy
to Bethesda.

325
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,394
Mrs. Kennedy and I will ride

326
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,277
with the casket
in the ambulance.

327
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,256
Valenti wants to know

328
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,111
how we're going
to handle the exit.

329
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,240
The exit?

330
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,919
He says Johnson
wants to talk to the press.

331
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,840
He can do whatever he wants.
We're leaving now.

332
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,554
The casket will be closed,
won't it?

333
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,640
At the funeral?

334
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,193
We'll sort that
all out later.

335
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,959
I want it closed
so badly, Bobby.

336
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,993
I'm not sure it can be
for a head of state.

337
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,636
There was blood
everywhere.

338
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,588
There were
so many pieces.

339
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,795
Jackie...

340
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,996
I tried to hold
his head together.

341
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,108
Hey!

342
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,673
Slow down.

343
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,913
The President
was lying motionless in the car.

344
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,309
Mrs. Kennedy was
leaning over him.

345
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,096
Governor Connally was
leaning back in his seat,

346
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,190
holding his stomach
with both hands.

347
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,993
Inside the emergency room,

348
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,276
witnesses said the First Lady,
splattered with blood,

349
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,191
waited without a word.

350
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,398
Jackie, Jackie...

351
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,034
Come on.

352
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,198
Make sure they make him
look like himself.

353
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,239
I know.

354
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,354
Where are the children?

355
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,834
They're with Maud.

356
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,115
She's taken them
to the house in Georgetown.

357
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,031
I'd rather them at home.

358
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,600
Their routine
shouldn't be disrupted.

359
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,432
Yes, yes, yes.
Of course. Mary...

360
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,556
I'll see to it.
What do they know?

361
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,715
...that cannot be weighed.

362
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,354
For me, it is a deep...

363
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,756
You need some rest.
Oh.

364
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,948
I think she needs water.

365
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,275
Thank you, Nancy.

366
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,036
It had to be some
silly little Communist.

367
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,997
If he'd been killed
for civil rights,

368
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,832
then at least it would
have meant something.

369
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
You know?

370
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,109
Jack warned me.

371
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,674
Jack said, he said
we were going to nut country,

372
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,149
but I thought
it was going well.

373
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,196
At Fort Worth. In Houston.
I know.

374
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,874
I kept... All the problems
that Adlai had...

375
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,037
Jack was winning him over.
Shh. I know.

376
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,192
They... They handed me
yellow roses.

377
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,510
Yellow roses.
At every stop.

378
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,398
Then in Dallas...
I know.

379
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,755
Here, let's turn this off.

380
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,477
They want a show of grief.

381
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,160
They're already asking
about funeral arrangements.

382
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,950
Darling. Come.

383
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,712
President Johnson
met with Secretary of State Rusk.

384
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,756
Minutes later,
there was a hastily added

385
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,314
conference with
Secretary of Defense McNamara.

386
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,555
Even at a time of sorrow,

387
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,756
the harsh facts
of the Cold War

388
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,671
do not allow
a pause in overseeing

389
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,791
the affairs of defense
and foreign policy.

390
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,198
There seems little doubt
that McNamara

391
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,151
will stay on under
Mr. Johnson.

392
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,508
A new president...

393
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,708
Lyndon's people
are claiming

394
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,751
I told him to take
the oath in Dallas.

395
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,840
Asshole couldn't wait,

396
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,030
and now they're
blaming me for it.

397
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,075
Excuse me.

398
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,471
Do you know
who James Garfield was?

399
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,029
No, ma'am.

400
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,794
Do you know
who William McKinley was,

401
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,995
what he did?

402
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,039
They were both
U.S. presidents

403
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,515
killed while
they were in office.

404
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,237
And what about
Abraham Lincoln?

405
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,709
Do you know
what he did?

406
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,235
He won the Civil War.

407
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,674
He abolished slavery, ma'am.

408
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,068
That's right.

409
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,119
Thank you.

410
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,870
Bobby, please tell them
I want the books on Lincoln.

411
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,075
About his funeral.

412
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,718
Mmm-hmm.

413
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,696
You'll have to share something
personal, eventually.

414
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,597
People won't stop asking
until you do.

415
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,076
And if I don't
they'll interpret my silence

416
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
however they want?

417
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,629
"Her brow furrows.

418
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,478
"Her lips are drawn.

419
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,949
"She holds back her tears,
but she can't hide her anger."

420
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,831
Most writers
want to be famous.

421
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,096
You want
to be famous?

422
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,997
No, I'm fine as I am,
thank you.

423
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,360
You should
prepare yourself,

424
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,318
this article will bring you
a great deal of attention.

425
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,908
Ah. In that case,
any advice for me?

426
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,228
Yes.

427
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,158
Don't marry the President.

428
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,790
Hmm.

429
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,238
Are you afraid
I'm about to cry again?

430
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,749
No, I'd say you're
more likely to scream.

431
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,840
Scream what?

432
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,798
"My husband
was a great man."

433
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,632
Lincoln's funeral cortege

434
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,551
departed the White House,

435
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,632
progressed along
Pennsylvania Avenue

436
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,994
to the Capitol.

437
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,394
And the next day

438
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,072
returned to
the White House,

439
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,390
then they walked all the way to St.
Matthew's

440
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,835
in a long, grand procession.

441
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,837
It was a sunny spring day.

442
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,076
Only 600 tickets
were allotted,

443
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,309
but thousands,

444
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,159
thousands lined the streets
and rooftops,

445
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,836
citizens, senators,
congressmen,

446
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,757
diplomats, officers,

447
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,832
all in their
full dress uniforms.

448
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,752
Lincoln's mount,
Old Bob,

449
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,196
was draped in a black blanket
with white trim and tassels.

450
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,672
Hooded,
he was led rider-less,

451
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,916
the head of
a miles-long procession

452
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,758
by the Reverend Henry Brown.

453
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,036
I can feel Jack
getting angry with this.

454
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,676
"There you go,
spending all that money

455
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,870
"on those silly
knick-knacks."

456
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,270
The man would spend
whatever it took for votes,

457
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,794
but balked at buying
a beautiful painting.

458
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,313
Huh.

459
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,555
We don't have to worry
about that anymore.

460
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,993
We must get
this right, Bill.

461
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,638
We must get this right.

462
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,397
It has to be beautiful.

463
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,473
Did you tell them we'll need
a horse-drawn carriage?

464
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,471
We have to
march with Jack.

465
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,073
Everyone.

466
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,835
A big, beautiful procession
that people will remember.

467
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,912
Mrs. Kennedy,
you don't have to do this.

468
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,479
Do what?

469
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,754
In fact, I don't think

470
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,149
they'll let you parade
through the streets.

471
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,591
The world's gone mad.

472
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,510
You should take the
children and disappear.

473
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,353
Build a fortress in Boston
and never look back.

474
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,912
Mrs. Kennedy?

475
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,511
Are the children awake?

476
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,716
They're playing
in Caroline's room.

477
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,192
How do I do this?

478
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,679
Oh, dear.

479
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,429
It doesn't matter
what you say.

480
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,512
Just hug them and tell
them it will be okay.

481
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,192
Mommy,
why are you dressed so funny?

482
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,473
Because something
very sad has happened.

483
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,916
And this is how we dress
when something sad happens.

484
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,591
Mommy, where's Daddy?

485
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,598
Daddy's not coming home.

486
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,479
Why not?

487
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,634
Daddy had to go see
your baby brother Patrick.

488
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,308
In heaven.

489
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,913
Why?

490
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,638
Because I'm here with you.

491
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,115
We don't want Patrick
to get lonely, do we?

492
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,752
But what about us?

493
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,673
Caroline, I need you
to be a big girl.

494
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,630
You can be brave, right?
You can be a soldier?

495
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,275
A very bad man hurt Daddy.

496
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,470
Daddy would come home
if he could.

497
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,679
But he can't.

498
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,511
He has to go to heaven.

499
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,511
Can I say goodbye?

500
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,195
Yes, of course you can,
my love.

501
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,116
Let your ears be attentive

502
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,111
to my cry for mercy.

503
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,789
If you, O Lord,
kept a record of sins,

504
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,519
O Lord, who could stand?

505
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,552
But with you
there is forgiveness,

506
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,108
therefore you are feared.

507
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,711
I wait for the Lord,
my soul waits,

508
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,394
and in his word
I put my hope.

509
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,710
My soul waits for the Lord

510
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,673
more than watchmen wait
for the morning.

511
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:59,756
O Israel,
put your hope in the Lord,

512
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,879
for with the Lord
is unfailing love.

513
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,671
That was
a beautiful mass.

514
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,192
Excuse me, Mother. Jackie.

515
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,194
Have you started on
the guest list for the burial?

516
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,599
The what?

517
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,870
You'll need to
pare it down, dear.

518
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,635
We can't possibly accommodate
all these people at Brookline.

519
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,880
Mr. Kennedy,
we need to discuss the funeral, sir.

520
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,120
We all want
to follow her lead,

521
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,117
but we still don't know
much about this Oswald.

522
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,111
There may be
co-conspirators.

523
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,318
I'll talk to her,
but she makes the call.

524
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,915
There's also the matter
of the Oval.

525
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,310
What do you want me
to do first?

526
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,470
Hmm? Plan the funeral
or pack the furniture?

527
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,794
I know this is
all delicate.

528
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,233
That's why
I'm approaching you.

529
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,231
But a procession is insane.

530
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,154
Brookline?

531
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,998
The family plot.

532
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,232
Well, I assume Jack will be
buried with the rest of us.

533
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,120
A crowd full of people,
given what's happened,

534
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,310
I just can't have
my President walking.

535
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,476
Your President?
My President.

536
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,671
Well, regardless
of what happens,

537
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,671
my brother is going
to be carried in a box.

538
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,318
And I am
sorry, sir.

539
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,592
Fuck off, Jack.

540
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,273
Averell Harriman owns

541
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,033
at least four properties
in Georgetown.

542
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,669
I'm sure he could
loan out one of them.

543
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,677
I'll have Sarge
look into it.

544
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,949
I'm sure we have time.

545
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,349
They can't expect us to
move immediately, can they?

546
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,671
Of course not.
Don't be silly.

547
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,035
Lincoln's widow
died destitute.

548
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,270
She moved back to Illinois,

549
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,794
had to sell
all her furniture.

550
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,270
And the Van Burens
and the Tylers, too.

551
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,877
She auctioned it off,
piece by piece,

552
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,877
just to keep a roof
over her head.

553
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,877
But that
won't happen to you.

554
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,871
And the collectors
we bought it from...

555
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,115
Remember? Bill and I,

556
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,800
we had to haggle
over every sofa, every chair.

557
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,471
If I sell some of it
back now,

558
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,472
maybe I can put John
and Caroline through school.

559
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,917
This staircase
goes up to the second floor,

560
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,076
which I know are reserved

561
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,475
for the private living of
the President and his family.

562
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,915
I don't think
any television cameras

563
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,798
or motion picture cameras
have ever gone up there,

564
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,075
'cause that's where you live.

565
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,593
That's right.

566
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,071
Here is what the White House
did to President Lincoln.

567
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,751
Here is how he changed.

568
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,671
1861.

569
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,513
The strong man
with the arched eyebrow.

570
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,752
1865.

571
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,755
One week before
his assassination.

572
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,909
Mrs. Kennedy, do you spend
a great deal of time

573
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,075
in the Lincoln Room?

574
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,828
It was where we lived
when we first came here,

575
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,576
when our rooms
at the other end of the hall

576
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,669
were being painted.

577
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,896
It's a nice room.

578
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,195
Was this a bedroom
during Lincoln's time?

579
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,033
No, it was,
uh, Lincoln's Cabinet Room.

580
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,256
Are all the pieces

581
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,554
from Lincoln's time?

582
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,557
Uh, yes, they are.

583
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,030
The most famous one,
of course, is the Lincoln bed.

584
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,190
It was bought by Mrs. Lincoln,

585
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,032
along with
the dressing bureaus

586
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,111
and chair, and this table.

587
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,792
Um, she bought a lot
of furniture for this house,

588
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,876
which made her husband
rather cross

589
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,474
because he thought
she spent too much money.

590
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,553
And on the table
is the Gettysburg Address.

591
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,917
This is probably the greatest
treasure in this room.

592
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,672
And this sofa
and these two chairs,

593
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,075
they were sold
in that Lincoln sale

594
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,752
I was telling you about,

595
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,353
that Mrs. Lincoln sold.

596
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,078
And they went to England,

597
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,832
and then through
the descendants

598
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,309
of the man
who brought them there.

599
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,896
Here he comes, here he comes.

600
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,069
Bobby?

601
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,835
Here he comes out
and down the hall again.

602
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,354
I really don't know
what this situation is about.

603
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,631
Nobody has told me anything,
except that I'm accused of...

604
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,354
I don't mean
to upset your mother,

605
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,432
but Brookline is no place
to bury a President.

606
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,952
Did you
kill the President?

607
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,112
No, I've not
been charged with that.

608
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,350
In fact, nobody has
said that to me yet.

609
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,718
First thing I heard
about it was when

610
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,195
the newspaper reporters
in the hall...

611
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,152
Welcome to Arlington,
Mrs. Kennedy.

612
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,389
Thank you.

613
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,311
The third option
is just over there,

614
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,594
at the base of that hill.

615
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,233
That's too low.

616
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,594
What do you think, Ken?

617
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,835
I did like Dewey Circle,

618
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,536
if we could get rid
of the leaves in time.

619
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,336
Well, the problem
there isn't just the leaves.

620
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,873
It's the access roads.

621
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,576
There's gonna be
10,000 people here.

622
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,511
Well,
that's what I'm saying.

623
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,749
Jackie?

624
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,515
Jackie.

625
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,115
Hey.

626
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,280
Where are we going?

627
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,277
He can't just be
buried anywhere.

628
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,269
He deserves more.

629
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,799
Watch your step.

630
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,393
You all right?

631
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,471
My shoes are sticking
in the mud.

632
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,795
I think maybe you should
talk to a priest.

633
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,428
Maybe.

634
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,871
Bobby, I want to
talk to the press.

635
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,995
No.

636
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,195
No. You let
Dave handle that.

637
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,472
You know, that first night
Bob McNamara said

638
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,313
he'd buy back our house
for us in Georgetown.

639
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,070
I don't even
have things. I...

640
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,639
I don't have things.

641
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,312
I don't even have a home.

642
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,232
And what about this house?

643
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,471
This? It's awfully cold.

644
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,313
Well, you could light a fire,
invite people over.

645
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,656
The parties that you threw
at the White House,

646
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,716
nobody had ever
seen anything like that.

647
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,752
Private concerts with artists,
friends, drinking champagne

648
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,915
and singing...

649
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,752
Are you suggesting
I throw a party?

650
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,678
No, not now, obviously.
But, no. Uh...

651
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,194
I'm only suggesting
that you've, uh...

652
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,354
That you've brought life
to a cold house before.

653
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,431
That house was not mine.

654
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,238
Neither is this one.
Nothing is ever mine.

655
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,951
Not to keep, anyway.

656
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,350
Leaving that house
must have been very difficult.

657
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,035
A First Lady must always be
ready to pack her suitcases.

658
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,758
It's inevitable.

659
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,030
We've found beds for
almost all the family.

660
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,036
The Trumans at Blair House.

661
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,634
There was a brief crisis about
him not having a driver,

662
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,239
but Ike offered his.

663
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,550
We're running
a bed-and-breakfast.

664
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,392
Lyndon just wants to
move into the Oval.

665
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,471
He wants to
address Congress.

666
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,471
I'll hold him off
as long as I can,

667
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,551
but it has to happen
sooner or later.

668
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,313
They're worried
about an outdoor procession.

669
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,311
They think
it's a security risk.

670
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,154
Jackie.

671
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,918
They think
it's a security risk.

672
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,479
Everyone's spooked.

673
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,592
Apparently even
State's discouraging

674
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,671
foreign dignitaries
from attending.

675
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,150
It's eight city blocks
to St. Matthew's.

676
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,437
That's a long way to be
strolling through crowds.

677
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,275
All those rooftops.
All those windows.

678
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,036
Bobby,
it's our last chance.

679
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,636
We have to march with him.

680
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,393
It's true, it's true

681
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,149
The crown has made it clear

682
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,755
The climate must be perfect

683
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,077
All the year

684
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,355
A law was made
a distant moon ago here

685
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,397
July and August
cannot be too hot

686
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,359
And there's a legal limit
to the snow here

687
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,273
In Camelot

688
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,590
The winter is forbidden
till December

689
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,592
And exits March the second
on the dot

690
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,274
By order, summer lingers
through September

691
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,233
In Camelot

692
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,192
Camelot, Camelot

693
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,354
I know it
sounds a bit bizarre

694
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,638
But in Camelot

695
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,949
Camelot

696
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,796
That's how conditions are

697
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,555
The rain may never fall
till after sundown

698
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,312
By 8:00, the morning fog
must disappear

699
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,792
In short, there's simply not
A more congenial spot

700
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,475
For happy-ever-aftering

701
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:32,998
Than here in Camelot

702
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,512
Camelot, Camelot

703
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,509
I know it
gives a person pause

704
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,198
But in Camelot

705
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,349
Camelot

706
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,349
Those are the legal laws

707
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,477
The snow may never slush
upon the hillside

708
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,432
By 9:00 p.m.
the moonlight must appear

709
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,633
In short, there's simply not
A more congenial spot

710
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,636
For happy-ever-aftering

711
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:32,033
Than here in Camelot

712
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,713
How would you write that?

713
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,909
"She lights yet
another cigarette

714
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,990
"and explains
through her soft sobs

715
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,308
"that Jack wasn't perfect,

716
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,994
"but he was perfect
for our country.

717
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,551
"And I ask about his flaws,

718
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,153
"and she explains..."

719
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,753
Perfect people
can't change.

720
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,230
Jack was always
getting better,

721
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,713
stronger.

722
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:08,230
Sometimes he would
walk into the desert alone,

723
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,918
just to let himself
be tempted by the devil.

724
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,509
But he'd always
come back to us,

725
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,079
his beloved family.

726
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,913
And I don't smoke.

727
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,357
I shouldn't
say these things.

728
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,315
That's why
we're here, isn't it?

729
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,793
To talk about
what happened?

730
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,517
Is this a confession?

731
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,790
Only if there's
something you regret.

732
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,557
Everyone knows my story.

733
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,589
God isn't interested
in stories.

734
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,109
He's interested
in the truth.

735
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,028
I came here looking
for sympathy, Father.

736
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,519
Of course.

737
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,391
Father, are you listening?

738
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,833
I'm listening.

739
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,758
Yes, I think so.

740
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,437
I think God is cruel.

741
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,190
Well, now you're
getting into trouble.

742
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,993
God is love.

743
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,071
And God is everywhere.

744
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,594
Was he in the bullet
that killed Jack?

745
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,313
Absolutely.

746
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,632
Is he inside me now?

747
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,310
Yes, of course.
Of course he is.

748
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,036
Well, that's a funny
game he plays,

749
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,633
hiding all the time.

750
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,536
The fact that
we don't understand him

751
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,198
isn't funny at all.

752
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,476
If there's a heaven,
then there's your God,

753
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,676
with all his empty promises.

754
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,399
What kind of God
takes a father

755
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,357
from his
two little children?

756
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,715
Thy Lord sacrificed
his only son...

757
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,512
And my two babies.

758
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,757
Arabella in the womb.

759
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,354
And Patrick.
Thirty-nine hours on Earth.

760
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,908
Just long enough
to fall in love with him.

761
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,031
What did I do
to deserve that?

762
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,875
Nothing.

763
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:14,197
Jack and I hardly ever
spent the night together.

764
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,840
Not even that last night
in Fort Worth.

765
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,353
Your husband loved you,
Mrs. Kennedy. I'm sure of it.

766
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,591
I seem to remember
there being more to our vows.

767
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,878
Don't look at me like that.

768
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,752
I was First Lady
of the United States.

769
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:35,116
Women have endured
far worse for far less.

770
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,472
There are two kinds of women.

771
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,312
Those who want power
in the world,

772
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,914
and those who
want power in bed.

773
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,392
Of course,
now what am I left with?

774
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,191
When men see me now,
what do you think they feel?

775
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,268
Sadness.

776
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,559
Compassion.

777
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,192
Desire, maybe.

778
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,874
You're still a young woman,
Mrs. Kennedy.

779
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,150
I used to make them smile.

780
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,878
No one understands
the pain he was in

781
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,678
and how loyal he was.

782
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,314
Just some of his friends
were so crude.

783
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,119
Jack wasn't, of course.

784
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,031
But he could get
caught up in it.

785
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,755
Still, he was
a great father.

786
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,432
I picture him on that
rocking chair in his office,

787
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,795
Caroline and John
at his feet.

788
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,557
How could I hate him?

789
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,030
Take comfort
in those memories.

790
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,999
I can't.

791
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,350
They're mixed up
with all the others.

792
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,753
Do you have the latest list
from the State Department?

793
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,834
The dignitaries planning
to attend the funeral.

794
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,593
Oh, yes.
I have it right here.

795
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,755
General de Gaulle.

796
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,034
Prince Phillip.

797
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,270
Even the Soviet
Foreign Minister.

798
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,869
More than we were expecting?

799
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,960
Oh, yes.

800
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,194
There's dozens of names.

801
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,315
Good.

802
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,999
Will you read them to me?

803
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,513
Yes.

804
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,989
Um, from the United Nations,

805
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,757
there's Paul Hoffman,
Managing Director,

806
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,078
David B. Vaughan.

807
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,039
The King of Belgium.

808
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,190
Denmark,
the Crown Prince George.

809
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,670
Bulgaria, the Deputy
Minister of Foreign Affairs.

810
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,233
Canada,
it's the Prime Minister,

811
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,548
Lester B. Pearson.

812
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,596
Austria, the Chancellor.

813
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,320
I don't know.

814
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,994
I think you should just
try it without it.

815
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,436
We've been together
a long time,

816
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:03,999
haven't we, Nancy?

817
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,957
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

818
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,039
I used to worry that
you might be jealous of me.

819
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,160
Oh, stop it.

820
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,516
No, you never did anything
to make me feel that way.

821
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,239
But I worried.
After I married Jack.

822
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,356
After he won the election.

823
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,470
Now that seems ridiculous,

824
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:28,473
anyone...
Anyone being jealous of me.

825
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,271
I've buried two children,

826
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,476
and now I'm burying
my husband.

827
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,756
You know, I was jealous.

828
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,637
Of that dress
you wore in Vienna.

829
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,714
I know that it's hard
to see it right now,

830
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,598
but you have your whole
life ahead of you.

831
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,878
That's a terrible
thing to say.

832
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,075
You do!

833
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,435
That's a terrible,
terrible thing to say.

834
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,714
But you do.

835
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,314
I'm sorry.

836
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,474
I'm sorry.

837
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,958
What will you do now?

838
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,599
Oh, I'll stay with you.

839
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,240
You won't go anywhere?

840
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,360
No, I'm not
going anywhere.

841
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,753
I don't have
anywhere to go.

842
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,676
Those kids are so lucky
to have you.

843
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,796
No, they're
not lucky at all.

844
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,552
They're not lucky.

845
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:30,110
I'm scared, Nancy,
I'm scared, I'm scared...

846
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,674
I know.

847
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,834
I know.

848
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,016
At the Capitol,

849
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,871
where the President's body
will lie in state

850
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,256
throughout the remainder
of the day

851
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,016
after it has been removed
from the White House,

852
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:43,191
there will be
three short speeches or...

853
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,556
She'll be right down.
I'm told any moment.

854
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,312
...is allowed to start
viewing the body.

855
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,789
To Dallas, Texas,
and Tom Pettit.

856
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,438
There's the prisoner.

857
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,792
There is Lee Oswald.

858
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,754
He's been shot.
He's been shot.

859
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,071
Lee Oswald has been shot.

860
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,549
- There's a man with a gun.
- Jesus Christ.

861
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,755
Are you ready to go?

862
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,035
Yeah.

863
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,198
Will you look at me?

864
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,353
Mommy,
is it my birthday?

865
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,873
Not yet, dear.

866
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:17,157
But why am I wearing
my party clothes?

867
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,988
Special Agent Hill.

868
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,718
Whenever Mrs. Kennedy
is ready.

869
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,713
Oh, Clint.

870
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,312
We're nearly done here.

871
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,671
It's the strangest thing.

872
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,789
I hardly remember
anything after.

873
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,679
But I read about
what you did in the papers,

874
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,796
and I just wanted
to thank you.

875
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,320
We got to get a handle
on this thing.

876
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,157
We got to get involved.
Yes, sir.

877
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,676
This is making us look like
a bunch of goddamn barbarians.

878
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,797
Mrs. Kennedy is on her
way down with the children.

879
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,832
Turn the television off!

880
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,830
You're not to speak
a word of this.

881
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:10,596
Understood? I'll tell Jackie
when the time is right.

882
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,309
Sit down.

883
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,239
Excuse me?

884
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,034
Sit down.

885
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,431
Darling?

886
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,873
What do you remember?
Will you tell me everything?

887
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,234
I need to hear.

888
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,878
Mrs. Kennedy...

889
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,756
I was ten yards back
when I heard the first shot.

890
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,068
And as my eyes crossed
the President's car...

891
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,911
Mrs. Kennedy...

892
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,393
Keep going.

893
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:50,869
I had to get to you,
put myself between you,

894
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,996
the President,
and the shooter.

895
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,798
Who was it?

896
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,114
Was it that Oswald?

897
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,508
They think so.

898
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,431
I need to talk to him.

899
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,640
Uh...

900
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,789
I need to talk to him.

901
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:09,555
I don't... I don't know
about that, Mrs. Kennedy.

902
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,434
The children
are ready.

903
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,954
Shall I take them downstairs
to ride with Maud?

904
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,996
I would like them
to come with me.

905
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,513
But the press
is out front...

906
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,558
Their father is leaving
this house for the last time.

907
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,790
They should be there
to say goodbye to him.

908
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,029
But the cameras.

909
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,440
Those pictures
are being broadcast

910
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,999
to every corner
of the world.

911
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,674
Those pictures
should record the truth.

912
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,633
Two heartbroken,

913
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,915
fatherless children
are part of that.

914
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,911
You can tell them
I'm ready to leave,

915
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,228
with Caroline and John.

916
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,639
Yes, Mrs. Kennedy.

917
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,039
Nancy?
Yes?

918
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,470
I'm not
the First Lady anymore.

919
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,037
You can call me Jackie.

920
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,274
I will.

921
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,273
Caroline, are you ready,
sweetheart?

922
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,513
My brave girl.

923
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,797
Oh, John, John, John.

924
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,117
Let me take you, son.

925
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,111
I value my privacy.

926
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,474
I always have.

927
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,198
And yet,
in the days after,

928
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,669
directly after,
something seemed to change.

929
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:19,869
In what way?

930
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,154
Before the funeral,

931
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,959
the day you moved
the casket to the Capitol,

932
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,315
well, your children
were on full display

933
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,833
for the whole world to see.

934
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,433
Well, what
are you insinuating,

935
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,595
that I exploited them?

936
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,955
Oh, no, of course not.
I just, um...

937
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,033
Present arms!

938
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,671
I'm only wondering if you ever

939
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,830
considered to do more
to shield them.

940
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,434
I think that most people
would have...

941
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,670
We aren't most people.

942
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,750
Most people don't have to
make decisions like that,

943
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,115
hours after watching
their husband get murdered

944
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:24,389
next to them.

945
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,553
Oh, Lyndon.

946
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,033
What an awful way
to begin your presidency.

947
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,996
Are you saying
it was a mistake?

948
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,313
No, of course not.

949
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,313
How dare you?

950
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,756
They murdered him
inside the jail.

951
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,515
These people
can get to anyone.

952
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,431
How dare you
keep that from me?

953
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,919
You had no right!
The children?

954
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,136
The ceremony
at the Capitol...

955
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,296
I took them
out the front door.

956
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,673
Are you...
This is all insanity!

957
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:47,760
You and your brother.

958
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,592
All these years,
all your goddamn secrets!

959
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,960
That's not fair... Caroline
and John are all I have left,

960
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,389
and I put them in danger
because of you.

961
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,311
I would never
put you at risk.

962
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,879
You can't know that!

963
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,150
You think you all
control everything,

964
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,754
that you have the world
on puppet strings.

965
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,190
And you're ridiculous.
And I let myself believe it.

966
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,351
And this parade?
Who is it really for?

967
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,555
For Jack?

968
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:13,717
One more campaign stop
along the way to the grave?

969
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,356
Lyndon's people are right.

970
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,549
It's not worth it.

971
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,232
It's not worth
risking people's lives.

972
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,276
You tell them
we're calling it off.

973
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,913
We'll motorcade
to the Cathedral.

974
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
The back way.

975
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,514
And then we'll bury him,
and we put an end to all this.

976
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,397
I don't give
a damn anymore.

977
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,199
I don't.

978
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,736
I would never put you
and the children in danger.

979
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,399
I know you think I'm some
silly little debutante.

980
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,317
Listen to me. You don't
protect me anymore.

981
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,994
I would never put you
and the children in danger.

982
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,597
You don't know anything.

983
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:53,519
I lie awake at night,
and all I can think is

984
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,152
I should have been
a shop girl

985
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,593
or a stenographer.

986
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:02,595
I should have married
an ordinary, lazy, ugly man.

987
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,910
Let me share
with you a parable.

988
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,633
Jesus

989
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,317
once passed a blind
beggar on the road,

990
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,072
and his disciples asked,
"Who sinned,

991
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,831
"this man or his parents,
that he should be born blind?"

992
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,070
And Jesus said,

993
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,391
"Neither this man
nor his parents sinned.

994
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,398
"He was made blind

995
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,512
"so that the works of God
could be revealed in him."

996
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,359
And with that,
he placed mud on his eyes

997
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:48,917
and told him to wash
in the Pool of Siloam.

998
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:54,757
And the man did,
and he came back seeing.

999
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,712
Right now you are blind.

1000
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,074
Not because you've sinned,

1001
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,230
but because
you've been chosen.

1002
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,470
So that the works of God
can be revealed in you.

1003
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,068
It's perfect.

1004
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,716
We installed it
while you were away.

1005
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,399
I thought
it'd be a nice surprise

1006
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,589
for you and the President.

1007
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,079
It changes everything.

1008
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:26,799
And the Treaty Room?

1009
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,313
Hunter green.

1010
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,911
Exactly as you imagined it.

1011
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,553
I wish Jack...

1012
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,430
Who knows
if he would have cared?

1013
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,716
I lost track,
somewhere...

1014
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,193
What was real.

1015
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,633
What was performance.

1016
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,550
Well, he was a president.

1017
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,918
You were right earlier.

1018
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,639
I'm not going to
march tomorrow.

1019
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:01,073
I won't put people in danger
on account of my vanity.

1020
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,829
I was scared for you.
I still am.

1021
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,319
But I never thought
it was vanity.

1022
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,590
You know, that's what
Jack called all this.

1023
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,794
When he saw what we
were spending, he said,

1024
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,072
"Your little vanity project

1025
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,112
"is going to bankrupt
the federal government."

1026
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,878
People need their history.

1027
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,353
It gives them strength.

1028
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:30,435
They need to know that
real men actually lived here.

1029
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,275
Not ghosts
and storybook legends,

1030
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:37,230
people who faced adversity
and overcame it.

1031
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,669
What you've done
in this house matters.

1032
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,751
That's kind of you, Bill.

1033
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,995
Even I'm starting
to lose him.

1034
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,228
Pretty soon

1035
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,476
he'll just be
another oil portrait

1036
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,437
lining these hallways.

1037
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:12,272
Happy birthday to you

1038
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:17,557
Happy birthday to you

1039
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:21,679
Happy birthday, dear John

1040
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,393
I spoke to Johnson.

1041
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,639
Tomorrow...

1042
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,433
It's being handled.

1043
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,638
Everyone will ride.

1044
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,239
No procession.

1045
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,798
I'm sorry, Bobby.

1046
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,789
Do you think
Lincoln's widow knew?

1047
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,679
What?

1048
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:21,354
That we'd build a monument
to her husband?

1049
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,158
Why is this room
so peaceful?

1050
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,196
"Peaceful"? I don't know.

1051
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,953
Every time I walk
by this room,

1052
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:36,828
I'm reminded that
on January 1st, 1863,

1053
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:40,276
an ordinary man
signed a document

1054
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:43,033
that freed four million people
from slavery.

1055
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:45,879
So,

1056
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:50,631
I don't think of it
so much as peaceful

1057
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:55,032
as a place
of profound legacy.

1058
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:00,311
And it's too bad that ours
is totally fucking wasted.

1059
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,674
Bobby!

1060
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,560
What?

1061
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,711
Bobby, watch your mouth.

1062
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:09,439
What did we accomplish, huh?

1063
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:13,158
We're just... We're just
the beautiful people?

1064
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:14,673
Right? Isn't that
what we are?

1065
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:16,239
Bobby.
Because what did we...

1066
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,880
What did we truly accomplish?

1067
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,400
Maybe Jack will be remembered

1068
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:22,856
for the way he handled
the missile crisis,

1069
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,279
or maybe he'll be remembered

1070
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,759
for having created a crisis

1071
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,717
that he was then
forced to solve.

1072
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,716
We could have
done so much.

1073
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,909
Civil rights,
the space program.

1074
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:44,952
Vietnam. Now, Johnson
gets to handle Vietnam.

1075
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,871
We teed it up for him.

1076
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,951
He gets to knock it down.

1077
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:54,112
I shouldn't have pushed him
so hard on Castro.

1078
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,395
You can't
do that, Bobby.

1079
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,511
What's wrong with you?

1080
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,271
What's wrong with me?

1081
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,037
History is harsh.

1082
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,638
There's no time.

1083
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,596
We're ridiculous.
Look at you.

1084
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,719
I'm sorry.

1085
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,595
How do you like
your new office?

1086
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,239
Mrs. Kennedy.

1087
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,468
Come in.

1088
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,718
Sorry, I'm just
doing my job, ma'am.

1089
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,518
Of course you are.

1090
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,114
I remember
when we won the election.

1091
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,508
It was so overwhelming.

1092
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:29,669
We're doing just fine.

1093
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,512
Everyone's thoughts
are with you right now.

1094
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,750
Oh, that's
very kind of you.

1095
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,675
I've come
to discuss tomorrow.

1096
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,080
The Attorney General
relayed to me your desire

1097
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,439
for a more modest ceremony.

1098
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,953
I've changed my mind.

1099
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,188
I'm sorry?

1100
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:46,872
I said I've changed my mind.

1101
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,439
We will have a procession,

1102
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:50,033
and I will walk
to the Cathedral

1103
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:51,519
with the casket.

1104
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,270
Well, even if we could resume
the arrangements,

1105
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:57,440
I'm sure you can understand

1106
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,596
the Secret Service
still has their concerns.

1107
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:01,193
And President Johnson?

1108
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,616
President Johnson
would like nothing more

1109
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:03,760
than to fulfill your wishes,

1110
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,030
but I have to take
into account his safety.

1111
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,792
The country couldn't
endure another blow

1112
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,472
should anything...

1113
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,473
It's not the same.

1114
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:14,754
If it were up to him,

1115
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:17,070
he'd do anything that
might bring you comfort.

1116
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:20,279
Then who is it up to,
Mr. Valenti?

1117
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:21,475
Well, as I'm sure
you know,

1118
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:24,028
tomorrow we're expecting
close to 100 Heads of State.

1119
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,878
One-hundred three.

1120
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,228
Yes, I'm sure that's right.

1121
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,551
And I suspect they'll make
all their own decisions.

1122
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,471
Based on what?

1123
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,956
There's a great deal
of classified intelligence

1124
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:37,996
that I just can't get into.

1125
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,856
We've intercepted a threat
against General de Gaulle

1126
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,711
from our assets in Geneva.

1127
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,072
I'm afraid if he refuses
to march, others may follow.

1128
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,992
I understand.

1129
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,433
As I said, Mrs. Kennedy,

1130
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:53,576
I wish there were
more we could do

1131
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,079
to accommodate
your wishes.

1132
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,394
I'm terribly sorry.

1133
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:57,748
Don't be.

1134
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,070
You and the Johnsons
have already done so much.

1135
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,394
Good day, Mrs. Kennedy.

1136
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,919
Um, Mr. Valenti.

1137
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,553
Would you mind
getting a message

1138
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:07,240
to all our funeral guests
when they land?

1139
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:08,880
Of course.

1140
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:12,111
Inform them that I will walk
with Jack tomorrow.

1141
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,712
Alone, if necessary.

1142
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,916
And tell General de Gaulle

1143
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,554
that if he wishes to ride
in an armored car

1144
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,392
or in a tank
for that matter,

1145
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,074
I won't blame him.

1146
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,030
And I'm sure
the tens of millions of people

1147
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,758
watching won't either.

1148
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,398
Why are you doing this,
Mrs. Kennedy?

1149
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,550
Oh, I'm just doing my job.

1150
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,709
Would you like
to write this down?

1151
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,152
Do you think I should?
I...

1152
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:49,559
I do.

1153
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:59,990
We all live on
far after our deaths.

1154
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,068
Presidents will
come and go,

1155
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,037
and every one of them

1156
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,998
will look up to Jack
for guidance,

1157
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,749
for inspiration.

1158
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,798
What do you say to those
who say he didn't deserve it?

1159
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,908
The scale of it. I mean,
he was a great president,

1160
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,833
but he didn't win
the Civil War, for instance.

1161
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:25,915
It was a funeral for

1162
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,996
the President
of the United States.

1163
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,239
Your husband drove cars,
he didn't ride horses.

1164
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:32,976
Yes, and there should
have been more of them.

1165
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,319
There should
be more horses,

1166
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:37,796
more soldiers,
more crying, more cameras!

1167
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:48,190
I'm guessing you won't
allow me to write any of that.

1168
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,629
No,

1169
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:53,198
because I never
said that.

1170
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,952
Perhaps Jack didn't have time
to defeat Communism,

1171
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:03,798
but I do seem to recall...

1172
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,393
With all due respect,

1173
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:07,835
you were at the center
of it all, Mrs. Kennedy,

1174
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:11,073
and I'd imagine
it's impossible

1175
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:13,151
to have any perspective
from that vantage point.

1176
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:17,153
But I can assure you that
it was a spectacle.

1177
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:32,436
Nancy said
they wanted to share my grief,

1178
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,788
so I let them.

1179
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:38,957
But after, I realized
that all the pageantry,

1180
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:42,598
all the demands
I made to honor him,

1181
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:46,391
it wasn't for Jack
or his legacy.

1182
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,833
It was for me.

1183
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:51,472
I wrote him a letter.

1184
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:55,955
That night, before we moved
the casket to the Capitol.

1185
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,678
Do you know what I wrote?

1186
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:59,993
That I wanted to die.

1187
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,198
I understand.
Do you?

1188
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,389
I do.

1189
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:08,029
Unless you are
asking my permission.

1190
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,513
No, only crass,

1191
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:12,148
self-indulgent people
kill themselves.

1192
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,716
No, I was just hoping
that if I walked

1193
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,671
down the street
next to Jack's body,

1194
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:19,832
maybe someone would be
kind enough to do it for me.

1195
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,876
In front of
the whole world?

1196
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,114
Famous life, famous death.

1197
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:27,677
I never wanted fame.

1198
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:30,032
I just became a Kennedy.

1199
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:09,190
I told everyone
that I can't remember.

1200
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:10,599
It's not true.

1201
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:12,993
I can remember.

1202
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,473
I can remember everything.

1203
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,916
The first bullet. Boom.

1204
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,435
Then boom.

1205
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:29,993
I could have saved him.

1206
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,079
I should have known
it was a gunshot.

1207
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:39,071
I should have shielded him.

1208
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:41,994
I tried to stop the bleeding,

1209
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,720
but when we got
to the hospital, it was...

1210
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,518
That night,
and every night since,

1211
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,119
I pray to die.

1212
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,758
Won't God let me be
with my husband?

1213
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,839
Can I look?

1214
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,475
It's just the...
It hasn't...

1215
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,755
You don't write
very legibly, do you?

1216
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,470
You left your mark on this
country, Mrs. Kennedy.

1217
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:12,233
These past few days,
that's the story.

1218
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,913
Losing a president is like...
It's like losing a father.

1219
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,360
And you were a mother
to all of us,

1220
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,078
and that's
a very good story.

1221
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:25,640
The entire country
watched the funeral

1222
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:28,678
from beginning to end.

1223
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:30,832
Decades from now,

1224
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:37,836
people will remember
your dignity and the majesty.

1225
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,032
They'll remember you.

1226
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,470
It will serve
a definite purpose.

1227
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,518
My husband has
so many meetings up here,

1228
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:46,640
in this part of the house.

1229
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,998
All the men who wait to
see him now sit in the hall,

1230
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:52,594
with baby carriages
going by them.

1231
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:54,477
So they can sit in here

1232
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:57,597
and have a conference around
this table, waiting for him.

1233
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:00,920
Well,
he's going to come in, uh...

1234
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:02,913
Mr. President.

1235
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,035
Well, Mrs., uh...

1236
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:06,235
Mr. Collingwood.

1237
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,595
Mrs. Kennedy
has been showing us

1238
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:09,874
about the White House

1239
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:13,589
and all the changes
that she's made therein.

1240
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:16,399
What do you think of
the changes that she's made?

1241
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,038
Well, I think
the great effort

1242
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,350
that she's made
has been to, uh,

1243
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,635
bring us much more
intimately in contact

1244
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:24,278
with all the men
who lived here.

1245
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:25,873
Of course,
I think anyone who comes

1246
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:27,518
to the White House
as a President, uh,

1247
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,875
desires the best
for his country.

1248
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,551
But I think he does receive
a stimulus from the knowledge

1249
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:38,599
of living in close proximity
to the people

1250
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,590
who are legendary,

1251
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:44,359
but who actually were alive
and were in these rooms.

1252
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:01,915
Thank you.

1253
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:04,032
Everything will be
held in storage

1254
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:06,116
until you decide
where to settle.

1255
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:40,157
There's one last thing.

1256
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:42,555
It's more important
than all the rest.

1257
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,556
You know,
every night before bed,

1258
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:47,358
we had this old Victrola.

1259
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:50,031
We'd listen
to a couple records.

1260
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:52,475
His favorite was Camelot.

1261
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:53,709
The musical?

1262
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,518
Oh, I'm so
ashamed of myself.

1263
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,352
Every quote
out of Jack's mouth

1264
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,510
was either Greek or Roman.

1265
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:03,750
And that last song,
that last side of Camelot,

1266
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:06,400
is all that keeps running
through my mind.

1267
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,996
"Don't let it be forgot,

1268
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,035
"that for one brief,

1269
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:17,669
"shining moment
there was a Camelot."

1270
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,713
Jack loved history.

1271
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,358
It's what made him
what he was.

1272
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:26,919
Just imagine,
he was a little boy

1273
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,479
with scarlet fever in bed,

1274
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:29,993
reading history.

1275
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:32,839
King Arthur and the Knights
of the Round Table.

1276
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,638
That's what Camelot is about.

1277
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:38,554
Ordinary men banding together
to fight for a better world.

1278
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,271
Don't misunderstand me.

1279
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:44,032
Jack wasn't naive.

1280
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,472
But he had ideals.

1281
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,512
Ideals he could rally
others to believe in.

1282
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:53,355
Will those ideals
live on?

1283
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:56,033
Sure they will.

1284
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:58,395
Of course, there will
be great progress.

1285
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,436
There will be
other great presidents.

1286
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:03,353
The Johnsons have been
so generous to me.

1287
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,990
But there won't be
another Camelot.

1288
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,437
Not another Camelot.

1289
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:15,436
Why are you really here?

1290
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,239
'Cause I needed to talk.

1291
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:19,880
You say that you pray
every night to die.

1292
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:22,676
That your children
have no use for you.

1293
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:24,830
You wish only to be
with your husband.

1294
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:27,480
And yet, I'm not
burying you today.

1295
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:34,191
There comes a time
in man's search for meaning,

1296
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:36,316
when one realizes

1297
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:39,316
that there are no answers.

1298
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,397
And when you come
to that horrible,

1299
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:44,677
unavoidable
realization,

1300
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,556
you accept it
or you kill yourself.

1301
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:52,434
Or you simply stop searching.

1302
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:58,719
I have lived
a blessed life.

1303
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:03,230
And yet, every night,
when I climb into bed,

1304
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:08,110
turn off the lights,
and stare into the dark,

1305
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,273
I wonder...

1306
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,195
Is this all there is?

1307
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,518
You wonder?

1308
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,396
Every soul
on this planet does.

1309
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:21,639
But then,
when morning comes,

1310
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:24,280
we all wake up
and make a pot of coffee.

1311
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:25,799
Why do we bother?

1312
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,393
Because we do.

1313
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:30,631
You did this morning.
You will again tomorrow.

1314
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:35,075
But God,
in his infinite wisdom,

1315
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:36,752
has made sure

1316
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,670
it is just enough for us.

1317
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:51,430
Once more. Mrs. Kennedy
has expressed her desire

1318
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:55,399
to re-inter the bodies
of the two children they lost

1319
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:57,789
to rest alongside
their father.

1320
01:28:57,880 --> 01:28:59,552
You got that part, right?

1321
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:02,832
She wants them
to always remember,

1322
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:05,559
for one brief,
shining moment,

1323
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,790
there was a...

1324
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:11,110
Yeah, Camelot. Yeah.

1325
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:23,674
I hope you have a good night,
Mrs. Kennedy.

1326
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:28,910
He wrote down every word.

1327
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,592
Did it help heal you?

1328
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:33,148
It's been reprinted
all over the world.

1329
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:36,471
Maybe that's what they'll
all believe now. Camelot.

1330
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,750
People like to believe
in fairy tales.

1331
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,034
And you?

1332
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:44,280
Do you believe
you did him justice?

1333
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:46,954
I believe that the characters
we read about on the page

1334
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:50,715
end up being more real than
the men who stand beside us.

1335
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:53,833
I should have guessed

1336
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,275
it was too much to ask
that we grow old together,

1337
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:58,751
see our children
grow up.

1338
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:02,435
The darkness
may never go away,

1339
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,908
but it won't always
be this heavy.

1340
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:08,349
Come.

1341
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,436
They're waiting for us
at Arlington.

1342
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,472
In the name of the Father,

1343
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:23,114
the Son,
and the Holy Spirit...

1344
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,958
In the name of the Father,

1345
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:35,350
the Son,
and the Holy Spirit...

1346
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:07,635
Each evening,
from December to December

1347
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:12,550
Before you drift
to sleep upon your cot

1348
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:18,348
Think back on all the tales
that you remember

1349
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:21,871
Of Camelot

1350
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:29,114
Ask every person
if he's heard the story

1351
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,073
And tell it strong...

1352
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:36,995
I was just so happy
that he could be proud.

1353
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:39,594
Because then
I was having a baby,

1354
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:40,755
and I couldn't campaign,

1355
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:42,751
and then we got
in the White House,

1356
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:45,593
and all of the things
I'd always done,

1357
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:48,592
suddenly they
became wonderful.

1358
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:50,910
Because anything
the First Lady does

1359
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,753
that is different
everyone seizes on.

1360
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,356
And I was just
so happy for Jack

1361
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:58,954
that he could be proud of me.

1362
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:02,310
Those were our happiest years.

1363
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:10,958
Where once it never
rained till after sundown

1364
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:16,797
By 8:00 a.m.,
the morning fog had flown

1365
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,309
Don't let it be forgot

1366
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:23,388
That once there was a spot

1367
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:27,117
For one brief,
shining moment

1368
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:32,035
That was known

1369
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:38,798
As Camelot

1369
01:32:39,305 --> 01:33:39,308

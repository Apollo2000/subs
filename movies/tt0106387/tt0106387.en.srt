2
00:02:56,385 --> 00:03:00,389
So we're planning our next vacation.
I want Australia, she wants Italy.

3
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:04,393
I like snorkeling.
She likes garlic.

4
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,814
All of a sudden, out of nowhere,
she says to me: "do I need her?"

5
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,443
Jesus, Benny.
What kind of a question is that?

6
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,946
Need?
What does it really mean to need somebody?

7
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,240
Benny, fuel line.

8
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,161
Waldo, could you answer that phone?

9
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,082
- Hello.
- I need a check, Benny. COD.

10
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,460
In a minute.
Meet me in the office.

11
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:31,629
All right.

12
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,882
Put that out!
I got a fuel line broke.

13
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,968
Hey, Benny.
Joon's on the phone again.

14
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,804
I'll call back.
Find out what she wants.

15
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,140
It's an emergency.

16
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:46,393
She says you're runnin' low
on Peanut Butter Super Chunks.

17
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,481
An emergency...

18
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,989
The issue is jelly.
You only like two kinds.

19
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:05,162
You either like grape or boysenberry.
Which is it? All right.

20
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,665
Yeah, yeah, yeah, peanut butter.
I know. Super Crunch.

21
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,668
I'll see you at six, OK?
Bye.

22
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,296
Thanks for waitin', ma'am.

23
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,716
I'm afraid the best
we can do for you is gonna be...

24
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,928
It's gonna be $750.

25
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,174
If you check around, you'll see that
that is a really good deal.

26
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:25,140
Yeah?

27
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,559
That is a really very good deal, ma'am.

28
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,063
A little too good.

29
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,858
Let's do it.

30
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,543
Come here.
Come here.

31
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,765
You're not doing your job!
What is your job, anyway?

32
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,393
To clean this house, but not any more!

33
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,020
Get out of my sight!

34
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,397
You wouldn't dare, Joon!

35
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:18,068
What is going on here?
Joon?

36
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:21,113
Mrs. Smail, please, let me explain.

37
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,074
Beware, the winds of reason
shall blow stern.

38
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,243
- What?
- I'm done, Mr. Pearl.

39
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,579
I'm done!
The mule's turned to glue!

40
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:32,166
She wanders off unescorted.
She has sudden outbursts.

41
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,418
She's simply unmanageable.

42
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,921
Mrs. Smail, wait.
Please, let me talk to her.

43
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,675
I can talk to her.
You can't quit on such short notice.

44
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,470
I'm sorry, sir.
In Ireland, we have a sayin'.

45
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,765
"When a boat runs ashore,
the sea has spoken."

46
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,896
<i>Come on!
We can't play three-handed poker.</i>

47
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:58,484
She's gonna be alone every day.
I'm not leavin' her alone at night, too.

48
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,861
<i>So bring her.
She just paints and reads.</i>

49
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,447
Yeah, and lights things on fire.

50
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:07,076
<i>That happened once.
I got a fire extinguisher. Just bring her.</i>

51
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:10,954
Get your ass over here.
Don't forget the Louis Prima record.

52
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,207
Remember, always play for keeps.

53
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:17,169
All right, all right, all right.
Yeah, I'll be there. OK.

54
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,548
Joon, dinner!

55
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:34,103
Spaghetti and salad?

56
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,355
In that order?

57
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,651
What happened between you and Mrs. Smail?

58
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:44,822
She was given to fits of
semiprecious metaphors.

59
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,658
She's a housekeeper,
not an English professor.

60
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:49,118
She moves things.

61
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,663
She said you wandered off.

62
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,206
Did you leave the house alone?

63
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,501
Define "alone".

64
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:00,921
You know full well what I'm talkin' about.

65
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:07,177
I can't be worried about you knocking
another housekeeper into retirement.

66
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,596
First, it was Mrs. Larkspur.

67
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,099
A woman deeply and hygienically disturbed.

68
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,937
- Her hair smelled.
- But then it was Mrs. Piltz.

69
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,566
Piltz?
The answer's in the question.

70
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:27,531
Let's face it, Benjamin.
Hiring housekeepers is not your forte.

71
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:30,701
Well, until I do find another housekeeper,

72
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:33,495
you are gonna stick close to the house.

73
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,747
Understand?

74
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:42,212
Now have some salad. By the way, I want
you to come with me to my poker game.

75
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:46,717
- Benny...
- Come on. You'll have a good time.

76
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,887
Web belt and buckle.

77
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,517
Classical Greek martini shaker.

78
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,936
Six turkey-feather darts.

79
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:43,106
I'll see you with a Deanna Durbin album.

80
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:44,816
Come on.

81
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:51,031
- And I'll raise you with a stethoscope.
- Does it have little plastic earpieces?

82
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:55,536
- What do you care? You never win, Mike.
- I don't want 'em stabbin' my eardrums.

83
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,454
Steering-wheel knob.

84
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:00,332
Salad Shooter.

85
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,585
'56 Plymouth tire iron.

86
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:07,464
- Fold-0.
- You must have a good hand?

87
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:10,217
No, I'm bluffin'.

88
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,762
Really?

89
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,892
Come on.
You gotta play to find out.

90
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:23,146
OK. 150 feet of coaxial cable.
Show 'em.

91
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,984
- Full house. Jacks over fours.
- Shit.

92
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,196
I thought he was bluffin'.

93
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,658
Will someone get some air to his brain?

94
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,201
He was bluffing about bluffing.

95
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,746
You're a real pal, Benny.

96
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:44,167
I got a solution to your housekeeper
problem. You can have my roommate.

97
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:49,339
That's a terrific offer, Benjamin.
Save you from the chore of Smail shopping.

98
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,800
Those places are such drudgery.

99
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:55,387
Montgomery and Smails,
Smails and Roebuck, Smails-R-Us...

100
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:56,763
Joon.

101
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:01,935
- When did you get a roommate?
- Since last week.

102
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:06,607
My cousin pounded into town and life's
gone from heaven to hell in seven days.

103
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:11,653
- Just like the good Lord intended.
- 26 years old, he can't even read.

104
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,323
Spends all day polishing my plastic forks.

105
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:17,868
When you say he can't read,
what do you mean? Like words?

106
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:22,039
Yeah. And he keeps me up all night
watchin' stupid old movies.

107
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,665
My work's starting to suffer.

108
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,709
You install cable TV.

109
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,879
Joon, will you please glue your sequins?

110
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:34,051
Have we an internal sequin issue
to deal with, Benjamin?

111
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,554
All right, can we make this the last hand?

112
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,393
Come on, come on.
Play cards.

113
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:49,107
Two tickets,
tomorrow night's baseball game.

114
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,736
One Pocket Fisherman.

115
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,947
- Fold.
- Do you ever stay in?

116
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,704
Snorkel mask.

117
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,441
She knows how to rattle the day help.

118
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:16,862
I think we need to find someone
more understanding than Mrs. Smail.

119
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,906
Tell me, how are you two getting along?

120
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,992
Us?

121
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,078
Fine. Normal.
You know, fine.

122
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,164
- Why?
- I'll level with you.

123
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,418
I think it's time you gave some
serious consideration to a group home.

124
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,590
- She already has a home.
- Benny, she'd be with her peers.

125
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:41,136
She hates her peers.
She's quit the two day centers to prove it.

126
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:44,014
Look, all we need right now
is a new housekeeper.

127
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:48,185
Well, I know of no one else.
You've been up and down the list.

128
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,438
You might want to consider that
there are some people

129
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:54,566
more capable of handling
these episodes than you.

130
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,698
I think that you two living together
may not be the best thing any more.

131
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,203
I'm her brother, and I'm her only family.

132
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:10,624
And we've done just fine,
the two of us, for 12 years.

133
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:16,630
Yes, but her stress level is always
a factor in her display of symptoms.

134
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:19,966
Her agitation should be kept to a minimum.

135
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,261
Everybody gets agitated.
Sometimes it's the only option.

136
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,764
Benny, don't get me wrong.

137
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:28,225
I'm impressed how
you've managed this long.

138
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,979
But a group home would let her
develop other relationships.

139
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:37,150
We don't know this,
but what if she were capable of a job?

140
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,778
They'd encourage her in that direction.

141
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:44,616
These are very nice places...
nurturing, supportive.

142
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,868
I'm not farming her out.

143
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:14,479
I have every right to be outside, Officer.

144
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,731
- I have every right.
- Yes, ma'am.

145
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,025
May I see some ID, please?

146
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,166
Waldo, did you start that brake job yet?

147
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,461
Joon called.
You've run out of tapioca.

148
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:42,173
- She what?
- And the police will corroborate.

149
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,344
Holy shit.

150
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:51,683
Listen, Jack, you wanna go
to the baseball game tonight?

151
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,144
- Hey, thanks, Benny.
- Box seats.

152
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,774
Hello?
Joon?

153
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,084
Time for your medicine, Joon.

154
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,314
Good night, Steve.

155
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:36,287
- Hello. How's it goin'?
- I appreciate the deal on the engine.

156
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,750
- No problem. Is it runnin' all right?
- Yeah, it's running great.

157
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,461
- Good.
- So... can I...

158
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,131
Can I make it up to you with some dinner?

159
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,009
Some dinner?

160
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,846
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. Dinner with you.

161
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,560
You know what?
I can't.

162
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,062
- I mean, I'd like to...
- It's OK.

163
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,314
OK.

164
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,029
Stupid.
Stupid.

165
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:25,045
- 18-15.
- 17-16.

166
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,714
- 18-15!
- It caught the corner.

167
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:31,092
- It was a foot off the table.
- It was not.

168
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,303
- Juniper...
- Benjamin...

169
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,973
Don't underestimate the mentally ill.
We know how to count.

170
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,312
- OK, fine. 17-16.
- You can't give me what was mine.

171
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,731
- You're trying to cheat.
- I'm not.

172
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,984
- You're cheating.
- Joon, you're the one who's cheating.

173
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,361
You're all trying to cheat me.
You're trying to cheat.

174
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:09,756
Yeah. I spoke to some of the guys
on the staff, Benny.

175
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,092
Nobody wants to be a housekeeper.

176
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:19,307
I will. I'll keep tryin'. But I gotta
tell you honestly, I don't think so.

177
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:22,143
Yeah. OK.
Thanks.

178
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,395
Bye.

179
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,188
OK, Stevie.

180
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:40,680
I mean, I can't even keep a goldfish alive.
What chance do I have with Joon?

181
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:44,100
If somethin' bad happened to her, I'd...

182
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,230
I'd never ever be able to forgive myself.

183
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:52,358
A group home
is the right thing for her, Benny.

184
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,528
Yeah.
This is definitely for her own good.

185
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:00,200
Hey, it's for both your own good.

186
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,536
How much longer
can you do this to yourself?

187
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,206
Your life is literally passing you by.

188
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,959
You're right.

189
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:14,005
You're right.
What am I doing with myself?

190
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:19,594
I spend my life workin' on cars
and takin' care of my sister.

191
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:22,597
I can't have a relationship
without havin' to worry

192
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:25,141
about how Joon is gonna fit in.

193
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:28,853
Once she gets settled in,
you could actually take a vacation.

194
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,564
Travel a little.
I can hold down the fort.

195
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,316
Travel?

196
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,319
Travel?

197
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:39,405
Benny, there's a whole world out there.

198
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,242
I mean, picture yourself on the open road.

199
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,911
Wind in the hair in the El Camino.

200
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,372
Highway stretchin' out.

201
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,624
What's that, up ahead?

202
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,669
A lovely motorist, stranded.

203
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,922
Carburetor trouble.
Better investigate.

204
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:59,300
Yeah, right.
I'm gonna be stoppin' every 15 minutes

205
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,886
to call Joon to see how she's doin'.

206
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:08,142
OK, let's see.
Black Sabbath, over there.

207
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,604
- Is that a flashlight?
- It's a brush kind of a thing.

208
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,731
Here's a hat.

209
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:16,776
- Where's the batteries?
- You didn't win batteries.

210
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:20,154
- Those are mine.
- OK. Hey, guys, hurry it up!

211
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,782
Or we'll start without you.

212
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,076
I've been known to play a little cards.

213
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,932
Box of 30-aught-6 cartridges.

214
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,106
Medium-sized, green-haired troll.

215
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,484
Soap-on-a-rope, slightly used.

216
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:03,448
- Cards?
- Three.

217
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,576
- Cards?
- Two.

218
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,620
And the dealer takes...

219
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,415
three.

220
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:17,420
Pass.

221
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,633
Re-grout my shower.
Blue grout.

222
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,511
I fold.

223
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:30,391
Shampoo my dog.

224
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:33,061
Lava lamp.

225
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,940
Paint the exterior of my house.

226
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,193
Hey, come on, slow down.

227
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,195
This is supposed to be reasonable stakes.

228
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:46,074
That's a see and a raise.
You follow me?

229
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:56,125
- You take my cousin off my hands.
- Wait, wait, wait. Just stop.

230
00:22:56,292 --> 00:23:00,129
- Benny's gonna strangle you guys.
- Chill out, Thomas.

231
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:05,510
- Joon, we gotta go.
- Flush!

232
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,642
Full house.

233
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:15,478
Yes.
Yes!

234
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:19,982
- Benny, tonight's your lucky night.
- Mike warned her it was for keeps.

235
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,485
What?
What was for keeps?

236
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:25,488
I lost.

237
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:30,660
- What's in the pot?
- A cousin.

238
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:03,651
Rules are rules. Without 'em
there's no order in the universe.

239
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:06,863
Don't you give me that crap.
You took advantage.

240
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:11,617
Of your sick sister. A heart flush
is a perfectly respectable hand.

241
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,454
- Not respectable enough.
- Hey, shut up, Mike.

242
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:18,207
I am not takin' this guy home.

243
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:21,210
You have to!
Remember the bet I lost last year?

244
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:24,505
When I had to re-plate your socket set,
I didn't back out.

245
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:28,050
You can't bet a human being!

246
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,970
Well,
if you're gonna be a baby about it...

247
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:35,224
All right, Mike.
You wanna play like that? I'll take him.

248
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:41,230
I may not be responsible for what
I'm gonna do to him, but I'll take him.

249
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:51,699
Man.

250
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:57,914
- What are you doin', you jerk?
- Somethin' wrong with your oar.

251
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,167
- What'd you do with my hubcaps?
- I don't know.

252
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:09,217
- I'm Sam.
- So I hear.

253
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,594
I'm Benny.

254
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,140
With an n?

255
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,935
Yeah.
Two of 'em.

256
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,606
- This is Joon.
- With an n?

257
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:26,192
One.

258
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:30,988
You're out of your tree.

259
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:33,783
It's not my tree.

260
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:37,954
I think I need a beer.

261
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:44,585
Hey, Benny, wait a minute! Where are you
going? Come here! Gimme a jump! Hey!

262
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:58,099
You're goin' with them.

263
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:13,364
God bless you.

264
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:33,653
Hey, pal, we're tryin' to work here,
if you don't mind.

265
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:36,405
My God!

266
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:39,659
"I've been looking for my boyfriend.
Have you seen him?"

267
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,036
"He's a cute guy with a
little mole on his right cheek."

268
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:44,163
Ruthie, a ghost come back to haunt you?

269
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:48,751
"Brad! Brad!
Brad, please don't be dead!"

270
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:52,922
"I never got a chance to tell you what
you meant to me. Brad, please!"

271
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:55,257
It's you, Ruthie Mallenek,

272
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,927
co-star of The Prom Queen Mutilator
with Dick Beebee.

273
00:27:58,094 --> 00:28:00,638
- You saw that?
- "He was mine!"

274
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:02,431
"He was mine!"

275
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:05,935
"No. Cindy, you're sick.
You need help!"

276
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:09,146
"No, Cindy!
No! No!"

277
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:11,440
<i>"No!"</i>

278
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:17,673
Don't...
Don't touch it.

279
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,009
It's paint.

280
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:21,343
Yes.

281
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,686
Kirk Douglas.
Van Gogh. Ear.

282
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:38,694
These are yours.
You can sleep here. All right?

283
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:42,907
It's late.
Let's brush your teeth and hair.

284
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,662
- I can brush my own teeth, Benjamin.
- Fine.

285
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,831
- Hair, too.
- Perfect.

286
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:53,042
Come on.

287
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:59,215
Benny.

288
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,008
Hey, Benny.

289
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:05,513
Thanks for the couch.
Mike made me sleep under the sink.

290
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,099
You're welcome.

291
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:11,352
- Good night.
- Good night.

292
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,474
Mentally ill.

293
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:36,979
- Really?
- Yeah.

294
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:39,523
But, I mean, don't worry about it.

295
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:44,361
But just let her go about her routine.
Her routine is everything to her.

296
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:47,990
And don't hang around her room
while she's painting.

297
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:50,200
- She hates that.
- No.

298
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:53,287
If she runs hot and cold on you,
just ignore it.

299
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:55,080
That's just the way it works.

300
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:02,171
Listen, if she starts talkin' to herself,

301
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:04,632
don't worry about it, but don't answer.

302
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:06,425
OK.

303
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:11,764
She sometimes hears voices in her head.
That comes with the territory, too.

304
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:17,895
And... just make sure that nothin',
and you know I mean nothin',

305
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:20,689
happens to her.

306
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,734
OK.

307
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,071
OK.
All right.

308
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:38,350
Having a Boo Radley moment, are we?

309
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:58,620
- Morning.
- Hey.

310
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,998
- This today?
- Yeah.

311
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:06,420
So... what'd you do with the cousin?

312
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:11,133
The bus station? The river?
What? You throw him in the river?

313
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:15,262
- No, I took him home.
- You took him home?

314
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,972
- Yeah.
- To your house?

315
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:20,476
- Yeah, to my house.
- What, are you crazy?

316
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,728
Hey, believe me, it's only temporary.

317
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:27,149
Great. Hey, maybe he can tell Joon
about the group home?

318
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:30,194
If I'm gonna do this group-home thing,

319
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,489
I gotta figure out
the best way to tell her.

320
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,657
Where's Waldo?
Is he not here yet?

321
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:36,992
No.

322
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,536
That's it.
I'm gonna have a talk with him.

323
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:42,790
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am. What's his phone number?

324
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:45,959
555-0944.

325
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:33,632
Too loud!
Too loud!

326
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:38,262
What?

327
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:40,889
What?!

328
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:36,528
Where's Sam?

329
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:42,034
I didn't mean to kick him out. I mean,
I didn't kick him out, he just left.

330
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:46,788
What happened?
Did something happen?

331
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,958
He just...
He just left.

332
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,127
He was...
He was...

333
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:54,421
in the air and, and, and...

334
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,300
with a thing and...
It was really loud...

335
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:01,011
It was really loud.

336
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:04,765
And I just kept seeing...

337
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:08,185
He didn't mean to do it.

338
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,980
Do it?
What?

339
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:14,274
What did he...
What did he do?

340
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:18,695
He cleaned the house.

341
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:32,501
And you kicked him out for that?

342
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:04,032
Maybe I should invite him back in.

343
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:10,163
Yeah. Before someone sticks a stamp
on his head and mails him to Guam.

344
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,471
Some cultures...

345
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,766
are defined by their
relationship to cheese.

346
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,436
Is that a fact?

347
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:30,619
He can really cook, can't he?

348
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,790
...Yeah.

349
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:38,585
Although, for grilled cheese,
I might've used the wool setting.

350
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,796
That's what I told him.

351
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,300
Really?

352
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:49,137
- What did he use?
- Rayon.

353
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:52,224
Silk would've been too soggy.

354
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:54,851
- Cotton would've...
- Would've burned it.

355
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:57,521
Right.

356
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:00,649
Fortunately he consulted me
before giving it steam.

357
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:02,651
I was against it.

358
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:12,786
I wish he could be my new Smail.

359
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:21,229
Too bad.

360
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:22,981
What a shame.

361
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,353
Good night.

362
00:42:01,937 --> 00:42:04,022
Good night.

363
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:26,086
You need some help?

364
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,346
"Dear Mom, I've departed Mike's
with love and gratitude

365
00:42:36,513 --> 00:42:41,643
and am now living with Benny and
Joon Pearl, two devoted new friends."

366
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:46,690
"Benny's predisposition to hypertense
Irish monologists notwithstanding,

367
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:49,317
he has given me a job
as a domestic engineer

368
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:51,695
and seems pleased with me so far."

369
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,989
"Love, Sam."

370
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,368
I didn't know I could talk like that.

371
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,680
Tapioca?

372
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,433
Yeah.

373
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:33,486
- OK.
- Thank you, Ruthie.

374
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:38,033
You're welcome, Sam.
Let me know if you need anything, OK?

375
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:47,167
You don't like raisins?

376
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:49,836
- Not really.
- Why?

377
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:55,091
They used to be...

378
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:57,886
fat and juicy.

379
00:43:58,053 --> 00:44:01,556
And now they're twisted.
They had their lives stolen.

380
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:08,229
They taste sweet, but really
they're just humiliated grapes.

381
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:13,568
I can't say I'm a big supporter
of the raisin council.

382
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:19,532
Did you see those raisins on TV?
The ones that sing and dance and stuff?

383
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:22,243
- They scare me.
- Yeah. Me, too.

384
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:26,748
It's sick. They make them sing
and dance so people will eat them.

385
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:30,251
It's a shame about raisins.

386
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:33,046
- Cannibals.
- Yeah.

387
00:44:37,092 --> 00:44:39,552
Do you like avocados?

388
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,763
They're a fruit, you know.

389
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:44,307
Ruthie?

390
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:46,601
Do you got any avocados?

391
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:03,118
Joon?

392
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:17,632
You're very pretty
when you're off work, Ruthie.

393
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:22,470
- Thank you. Maybe I should quit my job.
- Where the hell have you two been?

394
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:25,557
Don't worry.
They were with me, running some errands.

395
00:45:25,724 --> 00:45:27,726
- Hi. How you doin'?
- Hi.

396
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:30,478
Running errands?
You ran an errand?

397
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:32,897
Yes, I did.
I ran an errand.

398
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:38,319
They're both named Steven.
One with a v and one with a ph.

399
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,280
Look, look, look!
Ruthie's movie.

400
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:42,949
Yes.
And she's staying for dinner, too.

401
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,953
Come on in.
Come on in.

402
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:54,461
- So why'd you leave?
- LA?

403
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,629
I wasn't that good of an actress.

404
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:59,174
Well, that's not how Sam tells it.

405
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,134
He's ravin' about you.

406
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:03,678
Well, he's sweeter than he is judgmental.

407
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,518
How long have you known him?

408
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:14,856
Sam?...72 hours.

409
00:46:15,023 --> 00:46:17,025
- Be serious.
- I am serious.

410
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:19,694
- Really?
- I'm always serious.

411
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:22,572
I'm too serious.

412
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:33,082
D'you ever get to the point in your life
where nothin' makes any sense?

413
00:46:36,044 --> 00:46:39,297
<i>Brad?
Brad?</i>

414
00:46:43,343 --> 00:46:46,429
<i>Quit kidding around.
This isn't funny any more.</i>

415
00:46:48,223 --> 00:46:50,475
Can we turn this off?
Can we just turn this off?

416
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:52,227
No!

417
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:55,021
<i>You!</i>

418
00:46:55,188 --> 00:46:56,731
<i>Cindy!</i>

419
00:46:56,898 --> 00:47:00,360
<i>Why did you do this?
You're sick.</i>

420
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:02,737
You need help.

421
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:05,907
Let me...
Don't!

422
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:09,744
<i>He was mine.
He was mine!</i>

423
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:12,580
<i>And if I can't have him, no one can.</i>

424
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:17,752
Not even you.
You didn't have to buy that same dress.

425
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:20,255
But you are my sister, Cindy.

426
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:22,048
I'm sorry about me and Brad.

427
00:47:22,215 --> 00:47:24,008
<i>We didn't mean to fall in
love at the party.</i>

428
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:26,094
<i>It just happened.</i>

429
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,640
<i>Let's just forget it. There 'll be
other boys, other midnight swims,</i>

430
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:32,934
<i>other prom dresses.</i>

431
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:36,229
<i>No!
No, Cindy!</i>

432
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:50,743
Try it again.

433
00:47:57,292 --> 00:47:59,627
There's only two reasons a car won't start:

434
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:03,464
either you're not gettin' fuel
or you're not gettin' fire.

435
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:05,049
You've got fire.

436
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,386
I think you'd better let me drive you home.

437
00:48:11,306 --> 00:48:13,558
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

438
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:30,158
Here it is.
It's right here.

439
00:48:30,325 --> 00:48:32,327
- Second job?
- Yeah.

440
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:34,871
Gotta make those ends meet, you know.

441
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:43,296
This is just howl imagined your place.

442
00:48:45,298 --> 00:48:47,508
- Well...
- You wanna come in?

443
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:49,302
Or you wanna...

444
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:51,846
No.

445
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:54,515
I'll come in.
For a minute.

446
00:48:55,725 --> 00:48:58,061
What is this?

447
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:03,399
- Nice porch.
- Pretty nice fish Joon gave you.

448
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:05,568
Yeah.
Those fish.

449
00:49:05,735 --> 00:49:08,279
Yeah, I was shocked.
I was...

450
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:11,616
- Nice fish. I mean, yeah...
- I never had a fish.

451
00:49:11,783 --> 00:49:13,826
What?
Not even as a kid?

452
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:18,790
No.
Underprivileged childhood, I guess.

453
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:21,626
- Downright un-American, if you ask me.
- Yeah.

454
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:23,503
You can have one of mine, if you want.

455
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:27,048
No, I couldn't possibly.
They were a gift.

456
00:49:27,215 --> 00:49:30,134
But we could share it.
Like joint custody.

457
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:32,303
You could take it on the weekends.

458
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:35,807
What is this?

459
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:39,227
Sit down, son.
You're makin' me nervous.

460
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:55,451
- Wanna beer?
- Yeah.

461
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:01,582
You know what?
I better not.

462
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:04,669
I gotta get goin'.
I better get goin', OK?

463
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:06,963
Yeah.

464
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:09,757
- OK.
- I'll take a rain check on the beer.

465
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:12,010
I got the doors.

466
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:14,762
- Wanna go to dinner?
- Ever been married?

467
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:16,931
- No.
- Yeah.

468
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:19,225
Yeah?

469
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:21,102
Great.

470
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:23,354
- See ya.
- See ya.

471
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:24,856
See ya.

472
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:30,106
- See you next week.
- Right. Thank you.

473
00:52:30,273 --> 00:52:32,775
Benny, would you come inside a moment?

474
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:35,027
Sure.

475
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:44,078
- Who's the new housekeeper?
- The new...

476
00:52:44,245 --> 00:52:46,247
This...

477
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:49,750
friend just came to stay
with us for a while, but...

478
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:52,003
Joon tells me he's a man.

479
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:56,924
Well, you know Joon,
how flowery she gets with words.

480
00:52:58,134 --> 00:53:00,761
So she's lying?
I mean, is it a man or isn't it?

481
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:04,473
Well...
Yes, technically.

482
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:07,602
He's really just a guy, a friend.

483
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,770
Where does this leave the group home?

484
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:12,106
I take it you haven't
talked to her about it.

485
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:15,651
No, not yet.

486
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:19,238
The admission date
is less than a week away.

487
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:23,284
But the thing is, she's really doin' fine.
She seems content.

488
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:25,912
Let's just leave it at that for now.

489
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:29,332
Let me know when you want to
tell her about it.

490
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:31,417
I'll let you know.

491
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:33,669
OK.
Bye.

492
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:49,477
- Hello.
- I want to help.

493
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:52,980
Wonderful.
OK.

494
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:56,817
If you'd like to fill out this
application, I'll be right with you.

495
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:40,611
Not so hard.

496
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,198
You actually have cuticles.

497
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:46,701
I know.
That's amazing.

498
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:50,037
What the hell is he doin'?

499
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,290
Mashed potatoes.

500
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:57,044
So are you and Ruthie considering itemhood?

501
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:00,715
Are you?

502
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:07,888
<i>Benjamin and Ruthjamin,
sittin' in a tree</i>

503
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:11,017
<i>K-i-s-s-i-n-g</i>

504
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:13,269
<i>First comes love, then comes marriage</i>

505
00:55:13,436 --> 00:55:16,772
- Get outta here!
<i>- Then comes a little baby carriage</i>

506
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:19,442
I'm just takin' her out to dinner.

507
00:55:47,053 --> 00:55:49,764
- That's a good joke.
- Did you like that?

508
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:01,776
- What time you got?
- It's eleven.

509
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:06,989
- On the nose?
- Right exactly.

510
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:13,496
I don't think I've asked
anybody the time before

511
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,081
and had it been right on the nose.

512
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:20,795
That's weird, isn't it?
It's right on the nose.

513
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:45,820
Do you want to come in for a while?

514
00:56:47,655 --> 00:56:49,698
I...

515
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:55,079
I've got that beer waiting for you.

516
00:56:57,873 --> 00:57:00,251
You know what?

517
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:05,631
I should probably go.

518
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:09,093
- OK.
- Listen...

519
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:12,471
Can I tell you somethin'?

520
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:14,306
What?

521
00:57:18,561 --> 00:57:20,563
You see,

522
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:26,235
my life is just real... complicated, and...

523
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:29,613
Gimme a break, Benny.
I just offered you a beer, OK?

524
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,711
No.

525
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:49,049
Why don't we pick up Ruthie
and get some ice cream?

526
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:51,218
- Yeah, let's get her.
- No.

527
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:53,888
- Why?
- 'Cause she doesn't want to talk to me.

528
00:58:19,622 --> 00:58:21,457
Come on.
We should go.

529
00:58:23,918 --> 00:58:26,003
Knock it off.

530
01:01:13,379 --> 01:01:15,464
He's incredible.

531
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,926
He's amazing.

532
01:01:30,771 --> 01:01:32,731
Did you have to go to school for that?

533
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:35,317
No, I got thrown out of school for that.

534
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:37,569
- Really?
- Yeah.

535
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:41,323
Hey, listen.
Why don't you guys go ahead?

536
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:44,410
I'm just gonna hang out here for a while.

537
01:01:44,576 --> 01:01:46,578
- Really?
- Yeah. Go ahead.

538
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:48,831
I'll see you at home, later.

539
01:01:49,832 --> 01:01:51,834
- All right?
- OK.

540
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,169
- That was great.
- No, no, no.

541
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:56,505
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

542
01:01:56,672 --> 01:01:58,632
Bye-bye.

543
01:05:22,002 --> 01:05:24,504
Joon?

544
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:26,798
What?

545
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:32,846
I love you.

546
01:05:36,183 --> 01:05:38,268
Me, too.

547
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:50,530
- Don't tell Benny.
- OK.

548
01:06:17,808 --> 01:06:21,853
Did you see the way you had everyone
in the palm of your hand?

549
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,815
You've got this gift
and you shouldn't ignore it.

550
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:29,069
- You should be doin' something with it.
- Like what?

551
01:06:29,236 --> 01:06:31,430
I don't know.
All I know is I looked at you and I said:

552
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:33,907
"This guy is somethin' else."
You're special.

553
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:35,951
You're not some schmo like the rest of us,

554
01:06:36,118 --> 01:06:37,828
who do what we do because we have to.

555
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:41,039
You're blessed.

556
01:06:41,832 --> 01:06:44,084
- Benny?
- What?

557
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:48,171
- How sick is she?
- She's plenty sick.

558
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:52,050
- Now, I've been doin' some thinkin'.
- Because it seems to me,

559
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:55,262
except for bein' a little
mentally ill, she's pretty normal.

560
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:59,099
Do you realize you could be
the next Buster Keaton?

561
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:47,606
I'm tellin' you, Randy. Listen.
You've got to see this guy.

562
01:07:47,773 --> 01:07:49,775
- Tell him, Eric.
- He's funny.

563
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:54,237
- He's amazing. Will you see him?
- Yeah, I'll see him. You never know.

564
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:56,114
Most of these guys just work locally,

565
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:58,617
but the better ones I can book out of town.

566
01:07:58,784 --> 01:07:59,910
You book 'em out of town?

567
01:08:00,077 --> 01:08:02,996
All over.
Detroit, Boston, sometimes LA.

568
01:08:03,163 --> 01:08:06,500
Really?
Can you see him tonight?

569
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,543
I'd love to see him tonight.

570
01:08:10,462 --> 01:08:13,423
- Hi.
- Is my car ready?

571
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,592
How you doin'?

572
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:17,844
Come on in.
Come on in.

573
01:08:18,512 --> 01:08:23,767
Listen, I want to apologize for the
other night. That all came out wrong.

574
01:08:23,934 --> 01:08:26,228
- No. No, it's OK.
- No, I really...

575
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:28,647
- How's my car?
- It's runnin' great.

576
01:08:28,814 --> 01:08:32,192
Your fuel pump was shot.
I threw in a new one. It's great.

577
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:34,778
How much do I owe you?

578
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:37,906
I'll tell you what.
Give me $30 for the part.

579
01:08:38,073 --> 01:08:40,200
I'm not gonna charge you for labor.

580
01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:42,953
- OK?
- Thanks.

581
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,622
Listen, if you're not doin' anything later,

582
01:08:45,789 --> 01:08:47,666
I just lined up this thing for Sam.

583
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:50,961
- What thing?
- It's kinda like an audition.

584
01:08:51,128 --> 01:08:54,589
Maybe his chance to make a living
at all this crazy stuff he does.

585
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:59,052
Who knows? Maybe he could travel,
play clubs. I don't know, you know.

586
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:02,013
So if you're not
doin' anything later and...

587
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:05,892
I don't know, Benny. I got food
to deliver, apartments to rent...

588
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:08,812
My life's pretty complicated right now.
You know?

589
01:09:11,857 --> 01:09:13,942
Thanks.
Bye.

590
01:09:17,988 --> 01:09:21,032
We'll lay out the whole routine
right after dinner.

591
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:25,245
You know what you could start with?
Remember the roll thing in the diner?

592
01:09:25,412 --> 01:09:27,831
Who died and made you Ed McMahon?

593
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:32,002
What is your problem? This is his chance
to do somethin', be somebody.

594
01:09:32,169 --> 01:09:35,755
- He is somebody.
- Yeah, I know, but he wants to be more.

595
01:09:38,133 --> 01:09:40,218
You don't know what he wants.

596
01:09:40,969 --> 01:09:44,681
I know he doesn't want to be
a housekeeper for the rest of his life.

597
01:09:44,848 --> 01:09:49,269
If you're worried about a new Smail,
don't worry, we'll get a new Smail.

598
01:09:51,605 --> 01:09:53,690
He's not my Smail.

599
01:09:54,983 --> 01:09:57,068
Housekeeper, whatever.

600
01:10:07,329 --> 01:10:09,414
We have to tell him.

601
01:10:15,045 --> 01:10:16,379
What?

602
01:10:18,173 --> 01:10:20,258
Tell me what?

603
01:10:27,474 --> 01:10:29,226
Benny...

604
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:34,773
Joon... and...

605
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:37,025
and I...

606
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:40,362
are... you know.

607
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:56,336
Bullshit.

608
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:04,094
You...

609
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:11,184
- Don't!
- Get the fuck out.

610
01:11:16,398 --> 01:11:18,942
You can't throw him out.
I won him.

611
01:11:19,109 --> 01:11:21,319
You just settle down.
Just settle down.

612
01:11:21,486 --> 01:11:23,655
- I love him!
- Yeah?

613
01:11:23,822 --> 01:11:25,907
Well, you are crazy!

614
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:29,369
I am not crazy.

615
01:11:31,371 --> 01:11:34,291
You see what we've come to?
You see?

616
01:11:37,294 --> 01:11:39,379
I hate you!

617
01:11:40,714 --> 01:11:44,259
I hate you!

618
01:11:49,848 --> 01:11:53,601
I hate you.
I hate you.

619
01:11:58,356 --> 01:12:00,066
I hate you.

620
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:21,171
Can I get you anything?

621
01:12:24,591 --> 01:12:27,510
- Tapioca.
- Tapioca?

622
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:31,264
OK.

623
01:12:31,431 --> 01:12:33,516
Anything on it?

624
01:12:35,477 --> 01:12:37,562
Raisins.

625
01:12:39,189 --> 01:12:41,274
OK.

626
01:13:51,177 --> 01:13:53,304
Hi.

627
01:14:31,426 --> 01:14:34,679
- Hi. How you doin'?
- You're out late.

628
01:14:34,846 --> 01:14:36,890
Yeah.

629
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:40,101
Listen.

630
01:14:40,685 --> 01:14:42,729
Do you have any tapioca?

631
01:14:43,855 --> 01:14:46,149
Jeez,
I've heard a lot of lines in my life...

632
01:14:46,316 --> 01:14:49,194
No, no, no, it's not for me.
It's...

633
01:14:50,445 --> 01:14:53,239
It's for Joon.

634
01:14:56,367 --> 01:14:58,411
- Come on in.
- Yeah?

635
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:54,300
Joon...

636
01:15:54,968 --> 01:15:56,970
OK?

637
01:15:57,136 --> 01:15:59,264
- Yeah.
- Good, good, good.

638
01:16:16,281 --> 01:16:18,324
I'm not.
No, no, I'm not.

639
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:28,835
OK?
All right?

640
01:16:34,549 --> 01:16:38,177
Hold tight.
OK. It's OK.

641
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:41,764
It's OK.

642
01:16:46,686 --> 01:16:49,856
I am not!
I am not! I am not!

643
01:16:50,607 --> 01:16:51,983
I am not!

644
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:01,951
Calm down.

645
01:17:04,162 --> 01:17:05,580
Shut up!

646
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:10,043
No, no.
No, no.

647
01:17:10,209 --> 01:17:12,003
Please...

648
01:17:22,055 --> 01:17:25,850
- Joon, please, come on.
- No, it's not all in my head.

649
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:37,528
Sir?
Sir!

650
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:39,864
Stop the bus, please!

651
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:43,618
Please stop the bus!

652
01:18:09,727 --> 01:18:11,771
No!

653
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:14,565
Joon.

654
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:28,121
- All righty. You wanna step out?
- Yeah, OK. Yeah, OK.

655
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:31,749
- How you doin', hon?
- You think I don't know who you are?

656
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:33,960
I know just who you are!

657
01:18:34,794 --> 01:18:37,130
So just leave.
Leave.

658
01:18:37,296 --> 01:18:38,423
Leave!

659
01:18:38,589 --> 01:18:40,800
My name's Shane.
I'm a paramedic in town here.

660
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:42,385
We're here to help you.

661
01:18:48,266 --> 01:18:50,935
Don't you touch me!
Don't touch me!

662
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:11,122
- Joon? Joon!
- Sir, stay back.

663
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:43,571
Look, I am going to see my sister. Would
you please just tell me her room number?

664
01:19:43,738 --> 01:19:48,785
- Please, just come back in the morning.
- Let me talk to her goddamn doctor!

665
01:19:50,328 --> 01:19:53,331
I'm sorry.
She doesn't want any visitors.

666
01:19:53,498 --> 01:19:55,917
Not you or anyone else.

667
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:58,544
She doesn't wanna see me?

668
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:00,880
No.
And she doesn't want to leave.

669
01:20:03,216 --> 01:20:07,053
Benny, why don't you go home?
Get some sleep.

670
01:20:08,221 --> 01:20:10,306
I promise I'll keep in touch.

671
01:20:31,244 --> 01:20:33,788
I hope you're happy.

672
01:20:33,955 --> 01:20:37,124
I hope you are happy with
what you have done to her.

673
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:42,588
You just stay the hell away from my sister.

674
01:20:45,258 --> 01:20:48,928
No.

675
01:20:49,095 --> 01:20:52,056
Wanna know why everyone laughs at you, Sam?

676
01:20:52,932 --> 01:20:54,934
Because you're an idiot.

677
01:20:55,101 --> 01:20:57,937
You're a first-class moron.

678
01:21:07,238 --> 01:21:10,283
- You're scared, Benny.
- I'm what?

679
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:13,786
You're scared.

680
01:21:13,953 --> 01:21:17,290
I can see it.
And I know why.

681
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:22,503
I used to look up to you.

682
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:25,756
But...

683
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:28,050
now I can't look at you at all.

684
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:32,925
- I think Fred Astaire is the way to go.
- Yeah?

685
01:23:33,092 --> 01:23:37,096
- That's a good choice.
- Who was that woman in, Roman...

686
01:23:37,263 --> 01:23:40,057
- Audrey Hepburn.
- Yeah. Sam, thanks a lot.

687
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:43,060
Have a nice day.

688
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:55,448
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I hope so.

689
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:02,621
- Hi, Benny.
- Thomas.

690
01:24:04,123 --> 01:24:06,333
How is she?
Tell me the truth.

691
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:10,755
- She's been better, Benny.
- You gotta tell me what room she's in.

692
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:16,469
335. But don't even think about it, Benny.
It's a closed ward. No visitors.

693
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:22,183
- No, we've gotta find Joon. Please.
- Thomas, get us in there to see her.

694
01:24:23,059 --> 01:24:27,188
- It's impossible, Benny.
- What do you mean, it's impossible?

695
01:24:27,354 --> 01:24:29,982
Listen, I just need two minutes with her.

696
01:24:30,149 --> 01:24:31,817
Benny, I'll get fired!

697
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:34,195
Thomas,

698
01:24:34,361 --> 01:24:36,614
I'm beggin' you, as a friend.

699
01:24:36,781 --> 01:24:41,535
I'd love to help you out, but Garvey's
gonna be in there to check on her soon.

700
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:44,455
My hands are tied.
My hands are tied!

701
01:24:53,172 --> 01:24:54,965
What room did he say?

702
01:24:56,008 --> 01:24:57,760
335.

703
01:26:52,917 --> 01:26:54,168
Shit.

704
01:26:58,797 --> 01:27:00,299
What are you doin'?

705
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:04,970
Mommy?

706
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:06,263
What are you doin' here?

707
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:08,070
I don't think you're supposed to be here.

708
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:10,476
What room did you come out of?

709
01:27:10,643 --> 01:27:13,479
- Get the door.
- How'd he get past Security?

710
01:27:13,646 --> 01:27:14,813
Hey, watch the door.

711
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:44,969
Joon.

712
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:49,515
Look, I know you want to be left alone.

713
01:27:49,682 --> 01:27:53,185
But you do not belong in here.

714
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:56,355
Now,

715
01:27:56,981 --> 01:28:00,651
how would you like to try
livin' in your own apartment?

716
01:28:05,698 --> 01:28:08,784
- An apartment?
- Yeah.

717
01:28:08,951 --> 01:28:12,871
There's an apartment
available in Ruthie's building.

718
01:28:14,373 --> 01:28:16,542
You'd let me live in an apartment?

719
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:19,712
That's up to you.

720
01:28:21,005 --> 01:28:24,049
I'm through makin' those decisions for you.

721
01:28:30,597 --> 01:28:32,725
Listen, I...

722
01:28:34,476 --> 01:28:37,521
I'm sorry I was such a jerk.

723
01:28:37,688 --> 01:28:41,900
And about Sam, I was wrong.
I was dead wrong.

724
01:28:43,569 --> 01:28:46,739
- I scared him away.
- No, you didn't.

725
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:48,449
He's here.

726
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:51,577
- He is not.
- He's here. He got me in here!

727
01:28:51,744 --> 01:28:54,580
- He's somewhere in the building.
- He is not.

728
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:57,916
You'd never let me have him.

729
01:28:59,918 --> 01:29:02,046
God.

730
01:29:03,881 --> 01:29:06,592
Why do you hate me so much?

731
01:29:08,594 --> 01:29:10,763
I don't hate you.

732
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:13,766
You need me to be sick.

733
01:29:22,066 --> 01:29:24,109
Juniper Pearl's chart, please.

734
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:29,114
Thank you.

735
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:35,371
Hey, Wait!
Wally! Wait! Wait!

736
01:29:35,537 --> 01:29:38,582
Put him down! He's mine.
I've been lookin' for him.

737
01:29:38,749 --> 01:29:41,502
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'll take care of him.

738
01:29:42,628 --> 01:29:46,298
- Sam, you can't be in here.
- Where's Joon's room?

739
01:29:46,465 --> 01:29:49,551
- I've gotta see her.
- Come on, come on.

740
01:30:03,816 --> 01:30:06,568
Give me a reason why
I shouldn't have you arrested.

741
01:30:08,821 --> 01:30:10,823
- It's that one.
- Yeah.

742
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:12,533
- See?
- OK.

743
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:14,159
Sam, where you goin'?

744
01:30:14,993 --> 01:30:18,497
Benny, this is exactly
what we were trying to avoid.

745
01:30:18,664 --> 01:30:22,251
By now, Joon would be in a caring
and controlled environment.

746
01:30:22,418 --> 01:30:25,838
Isn't it obvious now that
you two need some distance?

747
01:30:26,004 --> 01:30:28,340
Why don't we ask Joon what she wants?

748
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:33,470
Sam, what are you doin'?

749
01:30:36,473 --> 01:30:39,435
Hey, Sam, come on!
Get down, right now!

750
01:30:40,185 --> 01:30:42,229
I don't know exactly what I want.

751
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:49,695
I do know... that I am tired of
everyone telling me what to do.

752
01:30:52,698 --> 01:30:54,825
Sam, come on!

753
01:30:54,992 --> 01:30:56,869
Don't touch that!

754
01:30:57,035 --> 01:30:59,204
Sam, leave that!
I'm beggin' you!

755
01:30:59,872 --> 01:31:02,291
Joon, we want what's best for you.

756
01:31:03,542 --> 01:31:05,586
I know that.

757
01:31:14,845 --> 01:31:16,638
I...

758
01:31:17,306 --> 01:31:19,391
Sam, come down now!

759
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,562
You're gonna get in trouble!

760
01:31:23,729 --> 01:31:25,814
I think I want to try
living in my own apartment.

761
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:44,291
...I don't know.

762
01:31:45,501 --> 01:31:47,586
Sam, stop swinging!

763
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,051
But I'm willing to let you try.

764
01:31:56,762 --> 01:31:59,348
I'll prepare the papers for her release.

765
01:32:00,766 --> 01:32:02,851
Thank you, Dr. Garvey.

766
01:32:05,938 --> 01:32:08,190
Come down!
Sam!

767
01:32:14,404 --> 01:32:16,490
Are you OK?

768
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:37,970
I know.

769
01:32:38,887 --> 01:32:40,973
Me, too.

770
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:44,977
I'm gonna check you out, OK?

771
01:32:50,691 --> 01:32:51,900
OK.

772
01:34:22,324 --> 01:34:25,285
Haven't we tried this before?

773
01:34:25,452 --> 01:34:28,497
Yeah, but my life's
a lot less complicated now.

774
01:34:31,792 --> 01:34:34,294
- Is Joon inside?
- Yeah.

775
01:34:34,461 --> 01:34:36,588
OK.

776
01:34:37,305 --> 01:35:37,818

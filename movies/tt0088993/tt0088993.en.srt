1
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:28,362
- Nothin', nothin' at all.
- Send it again.

2
00:01:28,862 --> 00:01:30,864
I've been sendin' it up
and down the coast from Sarasota
to the everglades.

3
00:01:31,365 --> 00:01:32,866
It's still getting back
the same day it aired.

4
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:37,871
There's nothing.
There's nobody, or at least
nobody with a radio.

5
00:01:37,906 --> 00:01:40,516
All right then.
Let's set down.
We'll use the bullhorn.

6
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:43,091
Set down? Wait a minute.
That's not in our contract.

7
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:46,630
It's the biggest city
within 150 miles. We're
gonna give it every chance.

8
00:01:46,665 --> 00:01:50,133
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Set down, John.

9
00:01:50,634 --> 00:01:54,638
I'll set us down,
but I won't leave my seat, and
lâ€™ll keep the engine running.

10
00:01:55,138 --> 00:01:58,607
Now, the first sign
of trouble, lâ€™m going up.

11
00:01:58,642 --> 00:02:03,647
If you ain't on board when
that happens, you're likely
to have a lousy afternoon.

12
00:03:07,844 --> 00:03:10,597
Calling anybody
on this frequency.

13
00:03:10,632 --> 00:03:13,565
This is
helicopter 4-0-alpha.

14
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,603
If you can hear me,
please listen carefully.

15
00:03:41,995 --> 00:03:43,997
Hello?

16
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:52,005
Hello?
Is anyone there?

17
00:03:52,255 --> 00:03:54,257
Hello?

18
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,262
Hello?

19
00:04:00,397 --> 00:04:02,899
Is anyone there?

20
00:04:05,902 --> 00:04:10,907
Hello?
Is anyone there?

21
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,414
Is anyone there?

22
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:24,921
Hello?

23
00:04:26,923 --> 00:04:30,176
Is there anyone there?

24
00:04:42,055 --> 00:04:44,558
Hello?

25
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:55,285
Hello?

26
00:04:56,786 --> 00:04:59,789
Is there anyone there?

27
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,226
Hello?

28
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,162
Hello?

29
00:05:08,164 --> 00:05:10,667
Is anyone there?

30
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:20,176
Hello?

31
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:43,333
We can lift you out
to safety. Please answer
my call if you can hear me.

32
00:05:43,368 --> 00:05:48,338
Forget it, Billy boy.
It's a dead place.

33
00:05:48,373 --> 00:05:51,841
They got the others,
you know.

34
00:05:51,876 --> 00:05:55,345
Listen.

35
00:05:56,346 --> 00:05:58,848
You can hear it
over the engine.

36
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:03,353
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

37
00:07:09,285 --> 00:07:12,253
Hey, you find anything?

38
00:07:12,288 --> 00:07:17,177
Yeah. A bunch
of real estate for sale
at closeout prices, man.

39
00:07:17,212 --> 00:07:19,644
Gas up the machine.
She's down to fumes.

40
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:23,299
No. Wait till it's dark.
There are too many of them
out there.

41
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,401
Yeah-hey,
it's no good
to leave the gas tank empty.

42
00:07:26,436 --> 00:07:30,440
- Suppose we need to get
out of here in a hurry.
- Then we're shit out of luck.

43
00:07:30,475 --> 00:07:34,444
They're getting too riled up.
Do it tonight when
they can't see you.

44
00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:39,315
They know we're in here even if
they can't see us. What good is
it to leave the gas tank emp...

45
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:43,202
the activity excites them.
There are too many of them.
And more and more every day.

46
00:07:43,237 --> 00:07:46,956
If we get a lot more, come out
and shoot some. Otherwise,
stay inside the building.

47
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:49,959
Stay out of sight.
Be thankful you live
in the suburbs, Johnson.

48
00:07:49,994 --> 00:07:53,463
You oughta see
how congested the city's
gettin' to be.

49
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:02,687
Miguel, come on.
Let's get below.

50
00:08:02,722 --> 00:08:07,692
Miguel, what can I do?
You... you...
what?

51
00:08:07,727 --> 00:08:11,231
Let me help.
No. I... I don't need help.
I don't need help.

52
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:13,698
Come on. Give me this.
I'm all right.
I'm just tired.

53
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:17,237
You're not. You're collapsing
from stress. Now, let me help...
collapsing from stress?

54
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:20,240
We're all collapsing.
This whole fucking unit
is collapsing...

55
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:22,242
everybody except you.

56
00:08:22,742 --> 00:08:24,744
I know you're strong,
all right? So what?

57
00:08:25,245 --> 00:08:28,248
Stronger than me.
Stronger than everyone.
So what?

58
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:31,251
So fucking what?

59
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:54,390
- That's a new grave.
- Major cooper.
He died this morning.

60
00:08:55,892 --> 00:08:58,359
And then there were 12.

61
00:08:58,394 --> 00:09:00,995
A burial this morning.
That's why there are so many
of them.

62
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,534
What's gonna bring them
tomorrow, Sarah? And the next
day and the next day after?

63
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:10,505
There are hundreds of 'em
over there, thousands.
A million of them!

64
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,294
You stick your head in the sun,
they're gonna come up behind you
and bite off your ass!

65
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:20,049
This is bullshit. Crazy.
If you've got an alternative,
we'd be happy to listen to it.

66
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,017
I got an alternative.
Yeah, yeah. I got
an alternative.

67
00:09:23,052 --> 00:09:27,056
Let's get in that whirlybird,
find us an island someplace,
get juiced up...

68
00:09:27,557 --> 00:09:31,060
and spend what time we got left
soakin' up some sunshine.

69
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:33,528
How's that?
You could do that,
couldn't you?

70
00:09:33,563 --> 00:09:36,065
With all that's going on,
you could do that
without a second thought?

71
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:41,070
Right. I could do that
even if all this wasn't
goin' on.

72
00:10:12,218 --> 00:10:15,722
Another waste of time,
right?
Got that right, man.

73
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:30,585
What'd you find?
Nothin'.

74
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,490
Nothin'? How far
up the coast did you go?

75
00:10:34,991 --> 00:10:37,592
A hundred miles each way.

76
00:10:37,627 --> 00:10:41,130
Jump in here, soldier.
We gotta bring in two more
dumb fucks. Let's go.

77
00:10:41,631 --> 00:10:44,634
- Two more? What's
Logan doing to them in there?
- Get in here.

78
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:47,136
He's been awake
for 24 hours. Can't you
get anyone else?

79
00:10:47,637 --> 00:10:50,605
What "anyone else"?
There isn't anyone else.
We're it.

80
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,143
The two of you
can't go in there alone.
It's too dangerous.

81
00:10:56,145 --> 00:10:59,614
Christ. I'll go!

82
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:03,152
- What's the matter
with your friend there?
- There's nothing the matter.

83
00:11:03,187 --> 00:11:06,022
All right. Let's go.

84
00:11:11,027 --> 00:11:13,529
You got it, Steel.

85
00:11:42,558 --> 00:11:46,562
Let's kick it out.
Come on. Step forward.

86
00:12:15,475 --> 00:12:18,559
This shows the 15th
as the last time you
took any out.

87
00:12:18,594 --> 00:12:22,598
That can't be right.
Oh, yeah. We forget to
write 'em up sometimes.

88
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:25,368
You've got to write them up.
It's essential.

89
00:12:25,403 --> 00:12:28,069
Can't you get that
through your thick skull?

90
00:12:28,104 --> 00:12:32,108
How the hell are we supposed
to keep track of how many
we got left?

91
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:41,751
Let's go, you dumb fucks!
Get over here!

92
00:12:42,001 --> 00:12:45,470
Hey! Here we are!

93
00:12:45,505 --> 00:12:48,574
Come on!

94
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:54,712
Come on, you dumb fucks.
Come on. Come on.

95
00:12:54,747 --> 00:13:00,219
- Come on, you fish brains. What
the hell's the matter with ya?

96
00:13:00,254 --> 00:13:03,106
They're scared.

97
00:13:03,606 --> 00:13:07,335
They know what'll happen
when Frankenstein
gets 'em.

98
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,064
If you're right, Rickles,
then they're learning.

99
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:14,532
They're actually
learning.
Come on!

100
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:19,455
Come and see
what I got for you!
Come on, you dick faces!

101
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:23,374
Here's a nice one hangin'.
Come on. Come and get it.

102
00:13:23,409 --> 00:13:28,164
- Come and try to bite it off!
- That's it. Whip it out.
That'll bring 'em on.

103
00:13:28,664 --> 00:13:32,633
Fuckin' "a."
Biggest piece of meat
in the cave.

104
00:13:32,668 --> 00:13:37,138
I don't wanna
excite the lady though.
Not with her boyfriend around.

105
00:13:37,173 --> 00:13:41,811
You're incapable
of exciting me, Steel, except
as an anthropological curiosity.

106
00:13:41,928 --> 00:13:46,030
- What the hell's
that mean, Rickles?
- It means you're a caveman.

107
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:51,571
You're a fuckin' throwback.
You've been spendin'
too much time underground, huh?

108
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:57,076
It's okay, Steel.
Throwbacks all got big dicks.

109
00:13:57,111 --> 00:14:00,545
Oh!

110
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,083
All right, you dumb fucks!
Get over here, you scumbags!

111
00:14:04,118 --> 00:14:08,204
Your old pal Steel
wants to see ya.

112
00:14:10,206 --> 00:14:12,173
- Shit.
- I'm coming up.

113
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,711
You're not strong enough
for up here. Send up the pole.
I'll watch out for lover boy.

114
00:14:15,746 --> 00:14:18,679
Don't worry.
I'm not strong enough? I've
done it dozens of times.

115
00:14:18,714 --> 00:14:22,718
I don't want you up here, lady.
Send up the pole.
They're gettin' closer.

116
00:14:22,753 --> 00:14:25,221
He's clamping.
Look at 'im.
Let go of the pole.

117
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:29,190
Listen to me.
Let go of the goddamn pole.

118
00:14:29,225 --> 00:14:31,727
Here they come! Let's go!

119
00:14:31,978 --> 00:14:36,948
Dumb fucks.
Pus-breeding bags of shit.

120
00:14:36,983 --> 00:14:41,487
You dumb-fucking bags of shit,
lâ€™ll kick your fuckin' asses.
Come on!

121
00:14:47,376 --> 00:14:50,880
Come here, scumbag.

122
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,763
Hook her up, will ya? Hook her.

123
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:13,152
Hey, nice hat,
asshole.

124
00:15:16,656 --> 00:15:18,658
Come on!
Get the other one out
of there!

125
00:15:46,969 --> 00:15:50,473
Steel, Steel, Steel,
cover! Cover!

126
00:15:50,508 --> 00:15:53,941
I got it.
- Geez.

127
00:15:53,976 --> 00:15:57,980
That's it. That's it.
That's it. I got it.
I got it. Come on.

128
00:15:58,015 --> 00:16:01,984
Come on. Come here.
Come here.

129
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:15,131
You almost killed Rickles.
Yeah. You almost killed Rickles.

130
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:18,599
Let 'im go, Steel.

131
00:16:18,634 --> 00:16:21,504
- He shouldn't have been
up there in the first place.

132
00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:25,473
Steel, stop it!

133
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:30,012
You dirty son of a bitch!
Let him go!
Let him go,

134
00:16:30,047 --> 00:16:33,015
goddamn it,
or lâ€™ll cut you in half.

135
00:17:01,377 --> 00:17:04,380
Shut up, you dumb fucks.
I hope they chop you up
for dog meat.

136
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,383
Come on, Rickles.
Let's get out of here.

137
00:17:07,418 --> 00:17:11,887
I hope you fuckin' rot!
Fuck you!

138
00:17:24,283 --> 00:17:27,787
I am not gonna let you
dope me up.

139
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,759
You need a sedative.
You're behaving
dangerously.

140
00:17:34,794 --> 00:17:39,799
- I'm just trying
to help you, Miguel.
- Well, I don't need your help.

141
00:17:46,806 --> 00:17:49,809
You made me look
like an asshole
out there.

142
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:53,312
You made me feel
like a piece of shit.

143
00:17:56,816 --> 00:17:59,819
You stay away from me
with that, Sarah.

144
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,824
You stay away from me.

145
00:18:15,334 --> 00:18:18,838
Ohh.

146
00:18:32,351 --> 00:18:35,354
You bitch.

147
00:18:57,877 --> 00:19:00,379
We've got to have
sterile conditions.
Half the work we do...

148
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,847
goes down the toilet
due to contamination.

149
00:19:02,882 --> 00:19:06,886
You'll work with
what you got, Fisher.
But it's madness!

150
00:19:07,386 --> 00:19:13,342
- Can't you understand...
- I understand this:
You and your playmates,

151
00:19:13,377 --> 00:19:15,845
you're running out of friends
fast around here.

152
00:19:21,434 --> 00:19:26,439
Look, major cooper
promised that...

153
00:19:26,474 --> 00:19:28,941
major cooper is dead.

154
00:19:30,443 --> 00:19:33,946
I'm in command now,
and lâ€™m telling you...

155
00:19:33,981 --> 00:19:36,914
that you work
with what you got.

156
00:19:36,949 --> 00:19:39,452
And you'd better
start showing me some results...

157
00:19:39,952 --> 00:19:41,454
or you won't have that
very much longer.

158
00:19:41,954 --> 00:19:44,957
How can we show you results
when we don't have
the proper working conditions?

159
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,926
We're in
a desperate situation here.
We need each other.

160
00:19:48,961 --> 00:19:51,964
Can't we just get along?
You need us,
the way I see it, lady.

161
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:56,469
I'm not sure we need you at all.
Fuckin' "a."

162
00:19:56,936 --> 00:20:01,440
I'm not even sure
what the hell it is
you're doin' in there,

163
00:20:01,475 --> 00:20:04,909
just what the hell my men
are riskin' their asses for.

164
00:20:04,944 --> 00:20:10,449
If there was more cooperation,
your men wouldn't have to
risk their asses as often.

165
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,172
- Miguel Salazarâ€™s
in bad shape.
- No shit.

166
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:24,079
I want him pulled off
active duty for a while until
we can evaluate his condition.

167
00:20:24,114 --> 00:20:27,967
- Can't spare 'im.
- He's over the edge.
He's turning into jell-o.

168
00:20:28,002 --> 00:20:33,938
- Jell-o?
- That's the way the spicks
say "yellow": Jell-o!

169
00:20:33,973 --> 00:20:37,977
Miguel is seriously
disturbed. He's close
to the breaking point,

170
00:20:38,012 --> 00:20:40,444
and that's dangerous
for all of us.

171
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:43,983
He can't handle
any more stress right now.

172
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:48,988
Well, maybe I should cut off
his extracurricular activities.

173
00:20:50,489 --> 00:20:53,457
Maybe you're
keepin' him too busy at night.

174
00:20:53,492 --> 00:20:57,997
We're talking
about a man's life here,
you son of a bitch,

175
00:20:58,032 --> 00:21:01,715
and the lives of others
he might put in jeopardy.

176
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,754
Maybe I should
put him in quarantine.
How 'bout it, Steel?

177
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:09,650
You call it, Captain.
I'll build him a cage.

178
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:13,477
Yeah. Might not
be a bad idea...

179
00:21:13,512 --> 00:21:16,015
give some of the rest
of us a shot at some lovin'.

180
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:20,519
Hey, it's gonna
be a long winter.

181
00:21:23,522 --> 00:21:26,607
Come on, Ted.
Let's get out of here.

182
00:21:26,642 --> 00:21:29,645
I'm callin' a meeting
for 7:00 tonight.

183
00:21:30,145 --> 00:21:33,614
I want everybody present.
Everybody, lady,

184
00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:37,117
including dr. Frankenstein
and including your boyfriend.

185
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:40,539
- I gave him a sedative.
He won't be awake.
- Look here, woman.

186
00:21:40,574 --> 00:21:43,542
I'm short on man power.
I won't have you goin' around...

187
00:21:43,577 --> 00:21:46,045
dopin' up any of my men
without orders from me.

188
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,163
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir!

189
00:21:48,198 --> 00:21:50,666
Fuck you, sir!

190
00:21:54,403 --> 00:21:57,471
Out of the frying pan,
into the fire.

191
00:21:57,506 --> 00:22:01,475
I thought cooper was an asshole,
but he was a sweetheart
next to Rhodes.

192
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:06,015
We could be in real trouble.
You'd better watch yourself... I
mean, physically watch yourself.

193
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:09,518
I can handle it.
Don't worry. It's not
going to come to that.

194
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:13,022
We've just gotta pound
some logic into their heads.
Impossible.

195
00:22:13,057 --> 00:22:15,524
Where's dr. Logan?

196
00:22:16,025 --> 00:22:18,527
Frankenstein?
He's in his laboratory.
Where else?

197
00:22:21,363 --> 00:22:26,001
There's a loss
of initiative, caution, many of
the human cognitive functions.

198
00:22:26,036 --> 00:22:30,005
Apparently the result
of decay in the frontal,
parietal,

199
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,723
temporal
and occipital lobes.

200
00:22:32,758 --> 00:22:37,513
On revival,
the rate of decomposition
slows substantially.

201
00:22:37,548 --> 00:22:40,382
Indications are
that these beings...

202
00:22:40,883 --> 00:22:43,350
could function
over a period of years...

203
00:22:43,385 --> 00:22:48,641
in cases of early revival,
10 to 12 years before decay
would threaten mobility.

204
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,787
The brain is the engine, Sarah,
the motor that drives them.

205
00:23:01,904 --> 00:23:04,406
They don't need any blood flow,
don't need any
of their internal organs.

206
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:08,509
Now, lâ€™ve severed all
the vital organs in this one.

207
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:12,047
There's nothing left
of the corpse but brain and
limbs, and still it functions.

208
00:23:12,548 --> 00:23:16,517
Oh, look, Sarah. Look.

209
00:23:16,552 --> 00:23:20,923
See, it wants me.
It wants food,
but it has no stomach.

210
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:23,891
It can take no nourishment
from what it ingests.

211
00:23:23,926 --> 00:23:28,372
It's working on instinct,
a deep, dark,
primordial instinct.

212
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:32,818
Decomposition occurs
first in the frontal lobes,
the neocortex,

213
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:35,821
and next
in the limbic system,
the middle brain.

214
00:23:36,322 --> 00:23:41,076
But the core... the core
is the last thing to be
attacked by the decay.

215
00:23:41,577 --> 00:23:45,581
It's the "r" complex, Sarah...
that central bit of
prehistoric jelly...

216
00:23:46,081 --> 00:23:48,584
that we inherited
from the reptiles.

217
00:23:49,084 --> 00:23:53,205
Here. I've gone into the center
here and attacked the
"r" complex discretely.

218
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,806
I've removed it
from the equation...
this corpse.

219
00:23:55,841 --> 00:24:00,346
I believe this creature would be
benign even if it had its
eyesight and its other senses.

220
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:03,349
Its primitive instincts
have been erased.

221
00:24:12,858 --> 00:24:17,980
It still has motor function,
probably still has powers
of deliberation.

222
00:24:19,365 --> 00:24:22,333
It can be domesticated,
Sarah, don't you see?

223
00:24:22,368 --> 00:24:26,372
It can be conditioned
to behave the way
we want it to behave.

224
00:24:26,407 --> 00:24:30,242
And all that's required
is 15 hours of fancy surgery...

225
00:24:30,743 --> 00:24:33,210
that only a handful of people
are trained to do.

226
00:24:33,245 --> 00:24:37,249
We were going to stop work on
the neurophysical, concentrate
on something more practical.

227
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,886
These finds are central to
the condition. I will
not stop work...

228
00:24:41,387 --> 00:24:45,699
that might lead to an answer,
let alone in an area that is
central to the condition.

229
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:50,012
But you're just proving theories
that were advanced months ago.

230
00:24:50,512 --> 00:24:54,016
And you're not even
proving them correctly. You're
making a lot of assumptions.

231
00:24:54,051 --> 00:24:58,520
You're wasting time trying
to define what's happening...

232
00:24:58,555 --> 00:25:01,488
instead of looking
for what's making it happen.

233
00:25:01,523 --> 00:25:05,027
And just slicing up
too many specimens.
It's extremely dangerous...

234
00:25:05,062 --> 00:25:06,994
to go up on top
and round them up in the wild.

235
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:10,998
Well, we can't control them.
What happened to this one?

236
00:25:11,033 --> 00:25:14,536
It was too unruly.
I couldn't handle it.
I had to destroy it.

237
00:25:15,037 --> 00:25:19,041
- We can still
get information from it.
- Dr. Logan,

238
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:21,543
we are losing
the cooperation of the men.

239
00:25:22,044 --> 00:25:25,547
I'm not even sure they'll
go up top when we run out
of the specimens we have.

240
00:25:25,582 --> 00:25:29,301
I'm not sure they won't
just try to shut us down
completely.

241
00:25:29,336 --> 00:25:33,771
Well, lâ€™ll show them results.
I'll show them results.

242
00:25:33,806 --> 00:25:38,811
I'll show them that these
creatures can be domesticated
even without the surgery.

243
00:25:38,846 --> 00:25:43,315
Knowing what they are, we can
begin to approach them properly,

244
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,783
condition them,
control them.

245
00:25:45,818 --> 00:25:49,705
We've got to do this, Sarah.
It's our only hope.

246
00:26:00,466 --> 00:26:05,185
Yes, this is major cooper.

247
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:10,342
I needed him, Sarah.
He's helping us more now than
he ever did when he was alive.

248
00:26:10,843 --> 00:26:16,231
- But I saw the grave.
- They buried one
of the specimens.

249
00:26:16,266 --> 00:26:19,450
Jesus. God, Logan.

250
00:26:19,485 --> 00:26:22,953
Do you know what
they'll do to you
if they find out about this?

251
00:26:22,988 --> 00:26:26,992
- Do you know what they'll do
to all of us?
- They'll never find out.

252
00:26:27,493 --> 00:26:30,746
He can't be recognized.

253
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:59,708
Not a peep. Long-range or short,
high-band or low, I can't
raise anybody.

254
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:03,696
How can that be,
McDermott? There must be
other groups like us.

255
00:27:03,731 --> 00:27:07,649
Somebody else must be tryin'
to radio.
Yeah. What the hell is this?

256
00:27:07,684 --> 00:27:10,617
Maybe we are the only ones left.
I'm sure there's others.

257
00:27:10,652 --> 00:27:14,156
This is not the best place
to be sending from, and a lot
of the equipment lâ€™m using...

258
00:27:14,656 --> 00:27:17,159
has been rotting down here
since the second world war.

259
00:27:17,194 --> 00:27:20,377
Well, it's up to you
to get it workin' right.

260
00:27:20,412 --> 00:27:23,916
Lay off the fuckin' booze
for a while, why don't ya?

261
00:27:23,951 --> 00:27:26,919
And get somebody
on that fuckin' horn, pronto.

262
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:31,924
Well, if we stay down here
long enough, lâ€™ll have to lay
off the fuckin' booze, Steel,

263
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:35,893
'cause there won't fuckin'
be any of it fuckin' left.

264
00:27:35,928 --> 00:27:41,433
In the meanwhile, I will
continue to indulge myself, and
I will continue doing my best...

265
00:27:41,468 --> 00:27:44,401
in the good fight
against dry rot and rust.

266
00:27:44,436 --> 00:27:48,941
Yeah? Well, your best
ain't good enough, asshole.

267
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:53,445
You think lâ€™m not aware
of our situation? You think I
want to stay isolated down here?

268
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,965
You know, lâ€™d make a desperate
effort to raise somebody...

269
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,450
just in the hope of gettin' away
from your nasty mouth, Steel.

270
00:27:58,485 --> 00:28:00,953
The fact is...

271
00:28:03,455 --> 00:28:06,008
the fact is...

272
00:28:07,042 --> 00:28:11,011
either we are
the only ones left...

273
00:28:11,046 --> 00:28:15,050
or there's nobody within range
of my puny little
second world war signals.

274
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:17,552
We used to talk to Washington
all the time. They could
hear us then.

275
00:28:18,053 --> 00:28:20,520
We were on relays then.
We weren't over the air.

276
00:28:20,555 --> 00:28:23,558
You know, the power's off
on the mainland now, in case
you haven't heard.

277
00:28:23,593 --> 00:28:29,529
All the shopping malls
are closed.
We don't appreciate your jokes.

278
00:28:29,564 --> 00:28:33,568
Keep it up, and lâ€™ll shove
that bottle of yours right
up your wise ass.

279
00:28:33,952 --> 00:28:37,456
I've got better things
to do than listen to this
kindergarten. Are we finished?

280
00:28:37,491 --> 00:28:40,924
No, we ain't
finished here, lady. Sit down.

281
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:44,428
What else do you want?
We've given you the reports
for this week.

282
00:28:44,463 --> 00:28:47,950
We've given you everything
you've asked for.
You've given us greek salad.

283
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:53,472
Formulas, equations,
a lot of fancy terms
that don't mean a thing.

284
00:28:53,972 --> 00:28:59,511
I wanna know if you're doin'
something that's gonna help us
out of this deep shit we're in,

285
00:28:59,546 --> 00:29:03,981
or if you're all in there
just jerkin' each other off.

286
00:29:04,016 --> 00:29:08,487
She doesn't have to jerk off
like the rest of us, Captain.
She got an honest-to-god dick...

287
00:29:08,522 --> 00:29:11,757
to get off on, huh?

288
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,993
It may be yellow,
but it's still a dick!

289
00:29:17,612 --> 00:29:21,116
I said we ain't
finished here, lady.

290
00:29:21,151 --> 00:29:24,119
Sit down.

291
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:27,372
Sit down, or so help me,
god, lâ€™ll have you shot.

292
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:32,878
- You'll what?
- I said,

293
00:29:32,913 --> 00:29:35,846
"lâ€™ll have you shot."

294
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:39,384
Have you lost your mind?
No, ma'am.

295
00:29:41,887 --> 00:29:47,809
Have you? I just told you I was
willing to kill you if you
didn't get back in your chair.

296
00:29:47,844 --> 00:29:50,744
You didn't get back
in your chair.

297
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:53,965
Goddamn it!
You can't shove us around
like this.

298
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,152
Since when did this
become a military operation?

299
00:29:57,187 --> 00:30:02,657
Since I took over.
Steel, shoot that woman.

300
00:30:02,692 --> 00:30:06,161
Bang! You're dead.

301
00:30:13,802 --> 00:30:16,304
Shoot that woman
or you're dead.

302
00:30:16,805 --> 00:30:19,758
You think
lâ€™m fuckin' around, Steel?

303
00:30:19,793 --> 00:30:23,226
You're wrong.

304
00:30:23,261 --> 00:30:27,399
Now, you got till a count
of five, and that's two
you wasted.

305
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:30,478
That's three.

306
00:30:30,513 --> 00:30:33,487
- Four.
- Sit down, Sarah.

307
00:30:33,522 --> 00:30:36,490
What is this?
Shut up and sit down.

308
00:30:36,525 --> 00:30:40,028
That's five, Steel.
All right.

309
00:30:40,063 --> 00:30:43,532
All right.

310
00:30:51,423 --> 00:30:55,177
No!

311
00:31:09,441 --> 00:31:15,447
Anybody else have any questions
about the way things are gonna
run around here from now on?

312
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:33,215
This ain't
a goddamn field trip, people.

313
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:36,718
This is a fuckin' war!

314
00:31:36,968 --> 00:31:41,222
I'm not down in this cave
for my health. I'm down here
on orders.

315
00:31:41,257 --> 00:31:45,442
Your orders are to facilitate
the job of this scientific team.

316
00:31:45,477 --> 00:31:50,482
This is a civilian team,
and we don't have to be
subjected to your tyranny.

317
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:54,602
Who's being subjected
to what, Fisher?

318
00:31:54,637 --> 00:31:57,998
You've lost one man.
Yeah. Right.

319
00:31:58,033 --> 00:32:01,324
We've lost five.

320
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:06,364
Where does it say we gotta
keep those dumb fucks next door
to where we sleep?

321
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:11,369
Where does it say we should
do any one thing but shoot
the mothers in the head?

322
00:32:11,404 --> 00:32:16,875
We don't have enough ammunition
to shoot them all in the head.

323
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:19,845
The time to have done that
would've been at the beginning.

324
00:32:20,345 --> 00:32:25,350
No. We let them overrun us.
They have overrun us, you know.

325
00:32:26,351 --> 00:32:28,854
We're in the minority now.

326
00:32:29,354 --> 00:32:32,357
Something like 400,000
to one, by my calculations.

327
00:32:32,858 --> 00:32:35,325
I haven't eaten.
Is there food?

328
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,329
You were supposed
to be here at 7:00 sharp,
mister.

329
00:32:39,364 --> 00:32:42,617
I know. Sarah told me.
I'm sorry. I couldn't
break away. Is there food?

330
00:32:42,652 --> 00:32:45,871
Listen, egghead, let me
bring you up to date on what's...
excuse me.

331
00:32:45,906 --> 00:32:47,838
Let me...
excuse me!

332
00:32:47,873 --> 00:32:52,494
- Is there food?
- I'm runnin' this monkey farm
now, Frankenstein,

333
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:57,499
and I wanna know what the fuck
you're doin' with my time!

334
00:33:02,003 --> 00:33:04,697
'Cause if we're just
jerkin' off here,

335
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:07,357
lâ€™m gonna have my men
blow the piss...

336
00:33:07,392 --> 00:33:10,360
out of those precious specimens
of yours,

337
00:33:10,395 --> 00:33:15,767
And we're gonna get the hell out
of here and leave you and your
highfalutin asshole friends...

338
00:33:15,802 --> 00:33:18,270
to rot
in this stinkin' sewer!

339
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:21,273
Is that food enough for ya?

340
00:33:21,406 --> 00:33:27,244
Where will you go, Captain?
You can destroy my specimens,

341
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,415
but what about the millions more
that are waiting to greet you
outside?

342
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:33,884
Do you really think
you can "blow the piss"
out of them?

343
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,924
All of them? They have you
in a hopeless situation,
strategically.

344
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:43,504
You're lost. Well,
you're lost unless...

345
00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:48,014
unless what?
Unless what,
Frankenstein?

346
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:50,517
- Unless you can
make them behave.

347
00:33:50,552 --> 00:33:54,556
This is a fuckin' loony bin!
I ain't bein' paid enough to
work in a fuckin' loony bin!

348
00:33:54,591 --> 00:33:58,944
- I ain't bein' paid at all!
- Paid? What the hell are they
payin' him for?

349
00:33:58,979 --> 00:34:03,448
All right. Shut up!
Just shut up!

350
00:34:05,951 --> 00:34:09,454
What the hell are you
talkin' about, Frankenstein?

351
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:12,923
I'll be able to
show you soon enough.
Sarah knows.

352
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:16,962
She's seen the progress
lâ€™ve been making.
Isn't that right, Sarah?

353
00:34:16,997 --> 00:34:19,965
Yes. There's been some progress.

354
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,433
What kind of progress?

355
00:34:23,468 --> 00:34:26,972
What are you talkin' about,
"make them behave"?
What does that mean?

356
00:34:27,007 --> 00:34:30,225
It means keeping them
from wanting to eat us,
for one thing.

357
00:34:30,342 --> 00:34:34,846
It means
keeping them in check,
controlling them.

358
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:39,484
- Controlling them.
- When are you gonna show us
something we can understand?

359
00:34:39,985 --> 00:34:42,103
Very close. Very close.
I think in a matter of weeks...

360
00:34:42,604 --> 00:34:46,072
I don't think there's any way
you can tell how long anything
is going to take.

361
00:34:46,107 --> 00:34:50,111
It could be months;
it could be years before we know
exactly what we're dealing with.

362
00:34:50,146 --> 00:34:53,079
Sarah's research...

363
00:34:53,114 --> 00:34:58,585
Sarah's research
is more esoteric than mine.

364
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:03,625
She's looking for a way
to reverse the process,
a way to eradicate the problem.

365
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,895
That could take a long time,
a very long time.

366
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:09,782
She may never find
what she's looking for.

367
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:12,634
We have a limited supply
of chemical agents.

368
00:35:13,134 --> 00:35:15,637
Our equipment
is hopelessly inadequate.

369
00:35:16,137 --> 00:35:21,276
McDermott doesn't
have decent radio gear.

370
00:35:21,776 --> 00:35:25,745
Now you're tellin' me
that you don't
have the shit you need?

371
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:30,034
We're runnin' low on ammunition.
We're runnin' low on men,
for chrissakes!

372
00:35:30,069 --> 00:35:34,289
It was very rushed.
This operation was put together
in a matter of days.

373
00:35:34,324 --> 00:35:38,560
Yeah, well, it can all
be taken apart in a matter
of minutes, lady,

374
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:42,797
and lâ€™m here to tell you
that lâ€™m ready to
do that little thing.

375
00:35:42,832 --> 00:35:45,265
I'm ready to
take the next train outta here!

376
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,268
I ask you again, Captain:
Where will you go?

377
00:35:48,303 --> 00:35:51,806
You have no choices.
You'll have to give us the weeks
that we've asked for.

378
00:35:51,841 --> 00:35:55,775
You have to give us
however long it takes.
Look.

379
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,278
There have to be survivors
in Washington.
My ass.

380
00:35:58,313 --> 00:36:00,780
They have more sophisticated
shelters than this one.
Bullshit.

381
00:36:00,815 --> 00:36:04,819
There have to be people
in those shelters who know
about us, who know where we are.

382
00:36:04,854 --> 00:36:07,322
With no radio contact,
they'll come looking for us.

383
00:36:07,357 --> 00:36:10,325
I said shut up!

384
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:27,842
You got
a little more time.

385
00:36:28,343 --> 00:36:31,346
A little more.
I ain't sayin' how much.

386
00:36:33,848 --> 00:36:39,354
But you'd better start
showin' me some results, and
you'd better not piss me off.

387
00:36:39,389 --> 00:36:44,859
You understand?
Nothin' happens around here
without my knowin' about it!

388
00:36:46,861 --> 00:36:51,948
And anybody fucks
with my command,

389
00:36:51,983 --> 00:36:57,989
they get court-martialed,
they get executed.

390
00:37:02,494 --> 00:37:06,498
You'd better know
I mean it, too, people.

391
00:37:16,124 --> 00:37:20,845
He wouldn't have done it.
I can't believe he would've.

392
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,814
No, he wouldn't
have done it.

393
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:29,354
- He would've had Steel do it.
- He can't be that inhuman.

394
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:34,324
No. He's human.
That's what scares me,
you know.

395
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:39,864
He won't shoot Billy 'cause
he doesn't have anybody else
who knows electronics.

396
00:37:39,899 --> 00:37:43,833
He won't shoot me,
'cause lâ€™m his ride.

397
00:37:43,868 --> 00:37:49,374
He probably won't
shoot old Frankenstein, 'cause
the old doc can talk him silly.

398
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:52,842
But the rest of you...

399
00:37:52,877 --> 00:37:56,381
better start worrying,
you know.

400
00:38:02,637 --> 00:38:06,641
Maybe if we tried
working together, we could
ease some of the tensions.

401
00:38:06,676 --> 00:38:10,645
- We're all pulling
in different directions.
- That's the trouble, Sarah.

402
00:38:11,145 --> 00:38:15,149
People got different ideas
concerning what they want
out of life.

403
00:38:57,325 --> 00:39:01,329
You are afraid,
aren't you?

404
00:39:02,413 --> 00:39:05,984
Just as afraid as I am.

405
00:39:08,503 --> 00:39:10,972
Why don't you take a sedative,
Sarah, so you can sleep?

406
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:18,463
You're full of shit,
Sarah, you know that?
You're really full of shit.

407
00:39:18,498 --> 00:39:22,276
I'm through with you.

408
00:39:22,311 --> 00:39:26,054
Fine then. Get out.

409
00:39:26,089 --> 00:39:29,057
Just get out!

410
00:40:33,287 --> 00:40:37,792
- Hey, guys!
Come on, man!
- For goodness sake!

411
00:40:46,551 --> 00:40:50,555
I'm all right.
Thanks, bill.

412
00:40:51,055 --> 00:40:54,524
I'm all right.
Here.

413
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:57,061
I've just filled it up.
Got a refill as well.

414
00:40:57,096 --> 00:40:59,831
No, thanks.
I'm all right. Really.

415
00:40:59,866 --> 00:41:02,567
It's just brandy.
Good for the heart.

416
00:41:03,067 --> 00:41:06,070
It's shit for your heart,
and it eats up your liver.

417
00:41:55,837 --> 00:41:59,841
We don't get a lot
of visitors out here,
and we like it that way.

418
00:42:01,342 --> 00:42:04,846
Here it is: The Ritz.

419
00:42:04,881 --> 00:42:06,848
Madam.

420
00:42:14,222 --> 00:42:17,225
John's probably
out the back.

421
00:42:27,368 --> 00:42:30,996
Hey! Well,
what do you know.

422
00:42:31,031 --> 00:42:35,080
Welcome
to civilization, Sarah.

423
00:42:35,115 --> 00:42:39,130
The last holdout.
It's pretty nice.

424
00:42:40,131 --> 00:42:43,134
Nicer than we got inside.

425
00:42:44,635 --> 00:42:49,105
- Not a bad idea.
- It's a little safer
where you are.

426
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,642
But we like
to live dangerously,
Billy boy and me, you know.

427
00:42:52,143 --> 00:42:57,148
That's a laugh. I haven't
seen you do anything dangerous
since we got here.

428
00:42:57,183 --> 00:43:01,652
We stickin' around.
That's gettin' a bit dangerous,

429
00:43:01,687 --> 00:43:05,156
as I hope you noticed
this evening.

430
00:43:08,142 --> 00:43:10,661
You're a mystery to me.

431
00:43:11,662 --> 00:43:13,664
You really are.

432
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:18,669
Not like
those other goons in there.

433
00:43:18,704 --> 00:43:23,191
You have a sense of...

434
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:27,643
Of what?
Never mind.

435
00:43:27,678 --> 00:43:30,646
No, no, no.
Come on. Let's
talk about it.

436
00:43:30,681 --> 00:43:33,149
I came down here
to get drunk.
I don't have the energy.

437
00:43:33,184 --> 00:43:39,190
Hey, hey. It takes more energy
to keep quiet than it does
to speak the mind.

438
00:43:39,225 --> 00:43:42,693
Go ahead.
Let go of what
you got, now.

439
00:43:44,695 --> 00:43:47,163
You were sent down here
to do a job.

440
00:43:47,198 --> 00:43:51,702
My job is to fly the whirlybird.
I've been doin' that job
just fine.

441
00:43:52,203 --> 00:43:55,206
You have the protection
of this facility. You eat
our food. You drink our water.

442
00:43:55,241 --> 00:43:59,210
And you don't
lift a finger to help.
Neither one of you.

443
00:44:14,225 --> 00:44:18,194
We don't believe
in what you're doin' here,
Sarah.

444
00:44:18,229 --> 00:44:22,198
Hey, you know what all
they keep down here
in this cave?

445
00:44:22,233 --> 00:44:27,738
Man, they got the books
and the records of
the top 500 companies.

446
00:44:27,773 --> 00:44:31,207
They got the defense department
budget down here.

447
00:44:31,242 --> 00:44:34,245
And they got the negative
for all your favorite movies.

448
00:44:34,745 --> 00:44:39,617
They got microfilm
with tax return
and newspaper stories.

449
00:44:39,652 --> 00:44:42,620
They got immigration records,
census reports,

450
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,623
and they got official accounts
of all the wars
and plane crashes...

451
00:44:45,658 --> 00:44:49,592
and volcano eruptions
and earthquakes and fires
and floods...

452
00:44:49,627 --> 00:44:53,130
and all the other disasters
that interrupted the flow
of things...

453
00:44:53,165 --> 00:44:56,599
in the good old U.S. Of A.

454
00:44:56,634 --> 00:45:00,137
Now, what does it matter,
Sarah darling?

455
00:45:00,638 --> 00:45:03,189
All this filing
and record keeping?

456
00:45:03,224 --> 00:45:08,479
We ever gonna give a shit?
We even gonna get a chance
to see it all?

457
00:45:10,364 --> 00:45:14,869
This is a great big
14-mile tombstone!

458
00:45:14,986 --> 00:45:17,536
Tombstone!

459
00:45:17,571 --> 00:45:21,742
With an epitaph on it
that nobody gonna bother
to read.

460
00:45:22,126 --> 00:45:25,630
Now, here you come...
here you come with
a whole new set of charts...

461
00:45:25,665 --> 00:45:28,097
and graphs and records.

462
00:45:28,132 --> 00:45:32,136
What you gonna do?
Bury them down here
with all the other relics...

463
00:45:32,171 --> 00:45:34,138
of what once was?

464
00:45:36,624 --> 00:45:40,561
Let me tell you what else.
Yeah, lâ€™m gonna tell you
what else.

465
00:45:41,062 --> 00:45:46,567
You ain't never gonna
figure it out, just like they
never figured out...

466
00:45:46,602 --> 00:45:49,535
why the stars
are where they're at.

467
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:54,058
It ain't mankind's job
to figure that stuff out.

468
00:45:54,575 --> 00:45:57,695
So what you're doin'
is a waste of time, Sarah.

469
00:45:58,195 --> 00:46:00,698
And time is all
we got left, you know.

470
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:07,588
What lâ€™m doing...
is all there's left to do.

471
00:46:07,623 --> 00:46:10,541
Shame on you.
There's plenty to do.

472
00:46:11,042 --> 00:46:16,180
Plenty to do. So long as
there's you and me and maybe
some other people,

473
00:46:16,681 --> 00:46:21,150
we could start over,
start fresh,
get some babies.

474
00:46:21,185 --> 00:46:25,690
And teach 'em, Sarah,
teach 'em never to come
over here...

475
00:46:25,725 --> 00:46:30,061
and dig these records out.

476
00:46:33,531 --> 00:46:35,498
Hey.

477
00:46:35,533 --> 00:46:41,038
You want to put some kind
of explanation...

478
00:46:41,073 --> 00:46:44,757
down here
before you leave?

479
00:46:44,792 --> 00:46:48,796
Here's one as good
as any you're likely
to find.

480
00:46:51,499 --> 00:46:55,002
We're being punished
by the creator.

481
00:46:56,504 --> 00:46:59,507
He visited a curse
on us...

482
00:47:00,508 --> 00:47:04,011
so we man could look at...

483
00:47:10,518 --> 00:47:13,020
what hell was like.

484
00:47:16,023 --> 00:47:20,027
Maybe didn't want to see us
blow ourselves up...

485
00:47:20,062 --> 00:47:23,996
and put a big hole
in his sky.

486
00:47:24,031 --> 00:47:29,536
Maybe he just wanted
to show us he was still
the boss man.

487
00:47:29,571 --> 00:47:35,042
Maybe he figure...
we was getting too big
for our britches...

488
00:47:36,043 --> 00:47:40,047
trying to
figure his shit out.

489
00:48:30,264 --> 00:48:33,767
You son of a bitch!

490
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:39,273
Damn it!

491
00:48:40,274 --> 00:48:43,242
It's no good.

492
00:48:43,277 --> 00:48:47,781
It's no fuckin' good.
What is that stuff?

493
00:48:48,282 --> 00:48:50,284
It's something
called beef treats, which
the army provides us with...

494
00:48:50,784 --> 00:48:52,286
so generously.

495
00:48:52,786 --> 00:48:55,289
- He won't touch it.
- Shit. I wouldn't either.

496
00:48:55,324 --> 00:48:58,257
Sorry. We're fresh out
of filet mignon.

497
00:48:58,292 --> 00:49:01,679
- What is this?
Part of Logan's plan...

498
00:49:01,714 --> 00:49:05,182
to try
and socialize these things?

499
00:49:05,299 --> 00:49:09,803
He told me himself
they don't eat for nourishment.
What are we hoping for here?

500
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:14,058
Hoping to satisfy the urge.
You see, Sarah, they're...

501
00:49:14,093 --> 00:49:17,526
they are us.
They are the extensions
of us.

502
00:49:17,561 --> 00:49:23,165
They are the same animal,
simply functioning
less perfectly.

503
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:27,821
They can be fooled, you see?
They can be tricked into being
good little girls and boys,

504
00:49:27,856 --> 00:49:32,826
the same way we were tricked
into it on the promise
of some reward to come.

505
00:49:32,861 --> 00:49:35,294
They have to be rewarded.

506
00:49:35,329 --> 00:49:38,832
Reward is the key.
I'm convinced of that now.

507
00:49:38,867 --> 00:49:40,968
Come. I've got something
to show you.

508
00:49:49,593 --> 00:49:54,098
That wasn't very nice,
you know. That wasn't
very nice at all.

509
00:49:54,598 --> 00:49:57,066
Let's go.

510
00:49:57,101 --> 00:50:02,856
And you can just sit there
in the dark and think
about what you've done.

511
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,243
Think about it.
Think.

512
00:50:18,756 --> 00:50:22,725
I call him Bub.

513
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:28,132
That's what the club fellas
used to call my father. Can you
imagine a surgeon called Bub?

514
00:50:28,167 --> 00:50:31,518
Nobody seemed to mind,
though. He was rich.

515
00:50:31,553 --> 00:50:34,486
My father was rich.

516
00:50:34,521 --> 00:50:39,026
He used to say
lâ€™d never be rich
doing pure research.

517
00:50:39,061 --> 00:50:42,029
I'd never be rich.

518
00:50:42,529 --> 00:50:46,533
Uh, Bub's been responding
so well lately,
lâ€™ve let him live.

519
00:50:48,535 --> 00:50:53,540
Well, is he alive or dead?
Well, that's the question
these days, isn't it?

520
00:50:53,575 --> 00:50:58,045
Well, let's say
that I let him
continue to exist.

521
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,513
Hello, Bub!

522
00:51:01,548 --> 00:51:05,802
Here are some toys for you.

523
00:51:05,837 --> 00:51:10,057
Some nice things
for you to play with.

524
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:16,313
You remember them
from before?
From before.

525
00:51:22,069 --> 00:51:25,439
Well, he's seen
the other things before,
but the book is new.

526
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:39,086
Look, look, look.

527
00:52:11,735 --> 00:52:16,240
I thought he'd do that.

528
00:52:26,884 --> 00:52:29,887
Open it up.

529
00:52:32,389 --> 00:52:35,392
He remembers.
He remembers everything
that he used to.

530
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:44,935
Bub, lâ€™m very pleased.
Very pleased.

531
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:47,903
What's he trying
to prove?

532
00:52:47,938 --> 00:52:50,441
I saw one of those things
sittin' in a car in d. C...

533
00:52:50,941 --> 00:52:53,909
tryin' to drive
down independence avenue.

534
00:52:53,944 --> 00:52:56,947
It didn't make me
wanna be its friend.
No. It's amazing.

535
00:52:56,982 --> 00:52:59,450
It's not what this one does,
but what he doesn't do.

536
00:52:59,485 --> 00:53:01,917
What do you mean?
He doesn't get excited...

537
00:53:01,952 --> 00:53:05,456
and doesn't get agitated
when Logan walks
in the room.

538
00:53:05,491 --> 00:53:09,960
He doesn't
see Logan as...
lunch.

539
00:53:10,461 --> 00:53:13,929
Dinner.
Breakfast.

540
00:53:13,964 --> 00:53:19,937
Having fun?
What's he doin'
in there?

541
00:53:21,555 --> 00:53:23,557
No need for that, Captain.
He's quite docile.

542
00:53:24,558 --> 00:53:28,061
Come in.
You can all come in.

543
00:53:28,096 --> 00:53:30,063
Bub won't mind.

544
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:59,843
Extraordinary,
isn't it?

545
00:54:10,854 --> 00:54:13,822
That's right, Bub.
Say hello.

546
00:54:13,857 --> 00:54:16,360
Come on, Captain.
Give me a break,
will ya?

547
00:54:16,395 --> 00:54:20,364
Say hello
to your aunt Alicia.

548
00:54:20,399 --> 00:54:22,866
Say, "hello, aunt Alicia."

549
00:54:23,367 --> 00:54:26,835
"Hello, aunt Alicia."

550
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:31,875
Hel-lo, aunt Alicia.
"Hello."

551
00:54:47,391 --> 00:54:52,396
Apparently,
he was in the military. Return
the salute and see what he does.

552
00:54:52,431 --> 00:54:56,900
You want me to
salute that pile
of walking pus?

553
00:54:56,935 --> 00:54:59,368
Salute my ass.

554
00:54:59,403 --> 00:55:03,372
Your ignorance is exceeded
only by your charm,
Captain.

555
00:55:03,407 --> 00:55:08,412
How are we going to
set an example for them
if we behave barbarically?

556
00:55:08,545 --> 00:55:11,548
Take the bullets out,
please, and let me
have your pistol, Sarah.

557
00:55:45,699 --> 00:55:49,167
It's empty, Captain.
We saw the bullets
come out.

558
00:55:49,202 --> 00:55:53,173
Let's see what he does.
Let's see what Bub does
in this situation.

559
00:56:04,685 --> 00:56:08,522
Jesus... Christ.

560
00:56:23,036 --> 00:56:28,041
What are we supposed to do?
Teach 'em tricks?

561
00:56:28,542 --> 00:56:32,796
What the fuck
is wrong with you people?
They're dead!

562
00:56:32,831 --> 00:56:37,050
They're fucking dead,
and you wanna
teach 'em tricks?

563
00:56:37,551 --> 00:56:42,556
They have to be rewarded,
Captain. Why else will they do
what we want them to do?

564
00:56:42,591 --> 00:56:44,773
I don't want 'em
to do anything but drop over!

565
00:56:44,808 --> 00:56:47,811
Yes, well, apparently
they're not inclined
to do that for you, Captain.

566
00:56:47,846 --> 00:56:51,530
Is this your progress?

567
00:56:51,565 --> 00:56:55,033
Is this the shit
that's supposed
to knock our socks off?

568
00:56:55,068 --> 00:57:00,574
It's the beginning, yes.
It's the bare beginning
of social behavior.

569
00:57:01,575 --> 00:57:04,543
Of civilized behavior.

570
00:57:04,578 --> 00:57:08,582
Civil behavior is what
distinguishes us from
the lower forms.

571
00:57:08,617 --> 00:57:13,051
It's what enables us
to communicate,

572
00:57:13,086 --> 00:57:18,342
to go about things in an orderly
fashion, without attacking
each other like beasts.

573
00:57:18,709 --> 00:57:22,713
Civility must be rewarded,
Captain.

574
00:57:23,714 --> 00:57:26,967
If it isn't rewarded,

575
00:57:27,002 --> 00:57:30,185
there's no use for it.

576
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:33,724
There's just no use
for it at all.

577
00:57:43,734 --> 00:57:47,237
'Possum ready?

578
00:57:48,739 --> 00:57:51,742
Come on. Grab it.
Come on.

579
00:57:51,777 --> 00:57:53,709
You got it?

580
00:57:53,744 --> 00:57:57,247
Hey. You got it?

581
00:58:08,508 --> 00:58:11,511
No!

582
00:58:18,518 --> 00:58:22,487
No! No!

583
00:58:22,522 --> 00:58:25,025
Miller! Miller!

584
00:58:33,417 --> 00:58:39,388
I can't do it.
I can't do it!

585
00:58:39,423 --> 00:58:43,543
I can't do it.

586
00:59:05,315 --> 00:59:08,784
Don't let this happen.

587
00:59:08,819 --> 00:59:13,707
Don't let this happen to me.
I don't wanna be one of them.

588
00:59:13,742 --> 00:59:18,712
Take me. Please. Take me.

589
01:00:13,016 --> 01:00:16,019
I need fire.

590
01:01:10,574 --> 01:01:13,076
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

591
01:01:23,587 --> 01:01:26,089
Get out of the way, lady.

592
01:01:26,456 --> 01:01:30,961
No. I amputated
the infected area.
I think I caught it in time.

593
01:01:31,461 --> 01:01:34,429
Yeah?
But what if you didn't?

594
01:01:34,464 --> 01:01:37,350
If I didn't,
lâ€™ll shoot him myself.

595
01:01:37,385 --> 01:01:39,684
It's the spick.

596
01:01:39,719 --> 01:01:44,224
The yellow son of a bitch.
It's his fault this happened.
It's his yellow fuckin' fault.

597
01:01:44,259 --> 01:01:48,228
Get out of the way, bitch,
or lâ€™ll go right through you
with this.

598
01:01:52,732 --> 01:01:58,238
We're getting to make this
a habit, man... pointing guns
at each other, you know.

599
01:01:58,488 --> 01:02:00,991
We just lost two men
'cause of this motherfucker.

600
01:02:01,124 --> 01:02:05,093
Weli... that kinda evens
the odds between us then.

601
01:02:05,128 --> 01:02:08,632
The spick's been bit, Captain.
We gotta blast him.

602
01:02:08,667 --> 01:02:12,002
He's been bit!
I got the infection
in time.

603
01:02:12,037 --> 01:02:14,603
That's bullshit, lady.

604
01:02:14,638 --> 01:02:18,591
I seen a thousand of 'em.
He's gonna die.

605
01:02:18,626 --> 01:02:22,095
If he dies,
lâ€™ll destroy him myself.

606
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:25,098
Unless he gets you first.

607
01:02:27,484 --> 01:02:30,487
You may still want to sleep
with him.

608
01:02:30,522 --> 01:02:33,132
I don't want him
inside the complex.

609
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:35,742
We'll keep him out here,
with us.

610
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:40,363
We gotta blast him,
Captain.

611
01:02:49,589 --> 01:02:52,092
That'd be doin' 'im a favor,
Steel.

612
01:02:53,343 --> 01:02:56,346
You think he wants
to walk around after he's dead?

613
01:02:56,381 --> 01:02:59,349
You think he wants to be
one of those things?

614
01:03:00,583 --> 01:03:03,518
Think about it, lady.

615
01:03:03,553 --> 01:03:06,521
And think about this,
all of ya...

616
01:03:06,556 --> 01:03:09,524
from now on,
you ain't gettin' shit
from me and my men.

617
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:13,563
Tomorrow morning,
we're going inside that corral,
and we ain't comin' out...

618
01:03:13,598 --> 01:03:18,018
till every one of those
rotten piles of garbage
has been wasted.

619
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:25,542
Come on, Steel.

620
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:38,054
Get out of there, Steel!
We got better things to do!

621
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:45,562
You're on my shit list,
flyboy.

622
01:04:03,079 --> 01:04:05,081
Thank you.

623
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:09,586
Let's take him inside,
clean him up.

624
01:04:09,621 --> 01:04:11,588
Think you can move him?

625
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:16,092
I-I think so.

626
01:04:35,612 --> 01:04:39,115
It's all right.
It's okay.

627
01:04:40,617 --> 01:04:42,619
Shh, shh, shh.

628
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,122
Shh, shh.

629
01:05:06,509 --> 01:05:10,513
- It's a man's sweater.
Try it on.
- Thanks.

630
01:05:15,518 --> 01:05:18,021
I have to go to the lab.

631
01:05:19,522 --> 01:05:21,524
He's going to need
some morphine...

632
01:05:22,025 --> 01:05:23,992
along with
some other supplies.

633
01:05:24,027 --> 01:05:29,532
I'd better go along.
I'm sure those boys haven't
calmed themselves down yet.

634
01:05:32,669 --> 01:05:34,671
I'm sorry I said
those things about you.

635
01:05:35,171 --> 01:05:38,174
I'm sorry too. Really.

636
01:05:38,209 --> 01:05:40,694
Well, what do you know?

637
01:05:40,729 --> 01:05:43,179
We are heroes after all.

638
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,682
What a relief.

639
01:05:58,695 --> 01:06:00,697
Sarah.

640
01:06:01,197 --> 01:06:04,200
He might not make it,
you know.

641
01:06:04,235 --> 01:06:06,703
I know it.

642
01:06:08,204 --> 01:06:10,206
At least we gave him
a chance.

643
01:06:10,241 --> 01:06:13,209
I'll keep an eye on him.

644
01:06:13,244 --> 01:06:15,176
Hey.

645
01:06:15,211 --> 01:06:19,716
You guys be careful.
You're not back in half an hour,
lâ€™m coming out to look for you.

646
01:06:19,751 --> 01:06:22,218
They'll leave us alone.

647
01:06:24,721 --> 01:06:26,973
Half an hour.

648
01:06:27,008 --> 01:06:29,225
We'll be back.

649
01:06:51,748 --> 01:06:54,215
Jesus god almighty.

650
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:58,755
The resident surgeon
has been burning the
midnight oils.

651
01:07:05,511 --> 01:07:08,514
What the hell has he been doin'
down here, slaughtering cattle?

652
01:07:09,015 --> 01:07:12,018
In his mind, that's probably
not far from the truth.

653
01:07:33,656 --> 01:07:36,124
Grandfather's talking.
His mind's talking.

654
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:41,414
There. I've put it away.
I've put it away, mother.
I've put it away.

655
01:07:43,416 --> 01:07:47,920
- Bastard. Be civilized!
Be civil.

656
01:07:47,955 --> 01:07:50,923
Christ! Take that off.

657
01:07:51,424 --> 01:07:56,429
Take that off! Take that off!

658
01:07:56,464 --> 01:08:00,066
Five minutes, mother.
Just five minutes.

659
01:08:01,818 --> 01:08:05,321
Oh, my god.

660
01:08:05,356 --> 01:08:08,825
Oh, my god.

661
01:08:12,238 --> 01:08:15,296
No, Sarah! Don't!

662
01:08:15,331 --> 01:08:17,834
It'll just bring out
Rhodes and the men.

663
01:08:17,869 --> 01:08:20,336
Leave it be,
leave it be.

664
01:08:22,338 --> 01:08:25,807
Let's go.
Let's get outta here.

665
01:08:25,842 --> 01:08:30,847
I'm beginning to think
we should take that helicopter
before somebody else does.

666
01:08:52,019 --> 01:08:53,986
Hello, Bub.

667
01:09:00,743 --> 01:09:03,246
Mother is very proud
of you.

668
01:09:03,281 --> 01:09:06,016
Very, very proud indeed.

669
01:09:06,051 --> 01:09:08,751
You did quite nicely today.

670
01:10:36,339 --> 01:10:40,593
I don't believe it.
Logan's star pupil.

671
01:10:42,845 --> 01:10:47,099
- Now, tomorrow, we can play
with these things again.

672
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:51,103
Now it's time
for your reward.

673
01:10:52,989 --> 01:10:54,991
I brought you
something good.

674
01:11:11,624 --> 01:11:13,876
What is that?

675
01:11:13,911 --> 01:11:16,128
Is that...

676
01:11:20,016 --> 01:11:22,385
it can't be.

677
01:11:23,386 --> 01:11:27,890
Oh, god. I can't look.
Can't...

678
01:11:34,146 --> 01:11:39,151
Good night, Bub.

679
01:11:39,652 --> 01:11:43,155
What are you givin' him
in there, Frankenstein?
What?

680
01:11:43,190 --> 01:11:46,542
- What is it, huh?

681
01:11:49,045 --> 01:11:51,047
What do you give him?

682
01:12:03,059 --> 01:12:05,526
Scum!

683
01:12:05,561 --> 01:12:10,066
No, you... you must listen to me,
Captain. You must listen.

684
01:12:10,101 --> 01:12:12,068
Listen to this.

685
01:12:19,692 --> 01:12:22,194
Hold it, Fisher.

686
01:12:22,229 --> 01:12:24,714
Torrez, get his gun.

687
01:12:24,749 --> 01:12:27,164
Take all the guns.

688
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:31,704
All of 'em.
All their fucking guns!

689
01:12:31,739 --> 01:12:33,589
Take all their guns.

690
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:36,092
All their guns!

691
01:12:37,093 --> 01:12:40,061
Those are my men in there.

692
01:12:40,096 --> 01:12:44,100
My men.
Those are my men in there!

693
01:13:40,523 --> 01:13:43,159
Hold it right there.

694
01:13:45,661 --> 01:13:48,129
Frankenstein's dead.

695
01:13:48,164 --> 01:13:52,668
This scum gets it next
unless you throw
your weapons out right now.

696
01:13:52,703 --> 01:13:55,171
He means it, Johnny.
He killed Logan
in cold blood.

697
01:13:55,206 --> 01:13:59,140
I killed Logan
because he was a butcher.

698
01:13:59,175 --> 01:14:03,679
I'll kill the rest of them one
at a time, unless you get your
black ass out here, flyboy.

699
01:14:21,447 --> 01:14:26,452
- Let him go, Rhodes.
- Torrez, get his machete.

700
01:14:29,455 --> 01:14:31,922
We're gettin' outta here
right now.

701
01:14:31,957 --> 01:14:34,960
You give me any shit about it,
I blow his head off.

702
01:14:34,995 --> 01:14:37,428
Whirlybird can't
hold us all.

703
01:14:37,463 --> 01:14:42,468
"Us all" ain't going.
Me, my men, you. That's it.

704
01:14:42,585 --> 01:14:44,587
You'll never get me to do that,
Rhodes.

705
01:14:47,973 --> 01:14:50,441
No!
Hey!

706
01:14:50,476 --> 01:14:55,981
Rickles, open the gates.
Steel, shove 'em in there.

707
01:15:03,105 --> 01:15:05,608
Have a nice visit
with McDermott, huh?

708
01:15:10,613 --> 01:15:16,118
Rhodes...
don't do this, please.

709
01:15:16,619 --> 01:15:19,086
Gonna give us a ride,
flyboy?

710
01:15:19,121 --> 01:15:23,125
I'll do whatever you say, man.
Let her go now.

711
01:15:30,132 --> 01:15:33,100
Rhodes. Let 'em off.

712
01:15:33,135 --> 01:15:37,139
I'll take you...
wherever you want to go.

713
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:41,644
Like you said,
chopper can't hold us all.

714
01:15:45,648 --> 01:15:47,650
Rhodes, don't do it.

715
01:15:49,151 --> 01:15:51,619
You do it, and I won't fly.

716
01:15:51,654 --> 01:15:55,658
I swear, you got to kill me
before I fly.

717
01:15:59,662 --> 01:16:04,166
Let 'em out.
That's the deal.

718
01:16:06,669 --> 01:16:10,638
I make the deals around here,
not you.

719
01:16:10,673 --> 01:16:14,677
Now you get your shit together,
whatever you need.

720
01:16:14,712 --> 01:16:17,144
Isn't there
an old silo back there?

721
01:16:17,179 --> 01:16:19,647
No. We can't go back there
without guns.

722
01:16:19,682 --> 01:16:23,185
- We can't stay here.
They'll tear us apart.
- Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

723
01:16:25,938 --> 01:16:27,940
Don't shoot 'im!

724
01:16:29,441 --> 01:16:32,444
We need his ass.

725
01:16:34,697 --> 01:16:36,699
Steel, kick him around
a little bit.

726
01:16:38,701 --> 01:16:42,705
Might knock some sense
into that jungle-bunny head.

727
01:16:52,798 --> 01:16:57,303
- Captain!
- That's it.

728
01:16:57,338 --> 01:16:59,305
Run, you fuckin' lunatics.

729
01:17:02,343 --> 01:17:04,577
Oh!

730
01:17:28,584 --> 01:17:33,589
They're gone, flyboy.
Let's go.

731
01:17:33,624 --> 01:17:37,057
Not a chance.

732
01:17:41,096 --> 01:17:44,099
- Jesus Christ.
That's the elevator.
- Check it out.

733
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:37,117
Aw, Jesus.

734
01:18:37,152 --> 01:18:39,655
Rock slide.
We can't get through.

735
01:18:41,156 --> 01:18:44,159
This way.
We can try and get around.

736
01:19:31,206 --> 01:19:33,709
Oh, it's you.
This way.

737
01:19:43,469 --> 01:19:45,971
Let's go, Torrez. Get up.

738
01:20:27,429 --> 01:20:30,647
Aw, shit!
Somebody took this apart.

739
01:20:30,682 --> 01:20:34,686
The only other control's
up on the platform
with a hand box.

740
01:20:34,721 --> 01:20:37,404
Stuck.

741
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:42,444
- Rickles, we can't
get out of here.
- Fix it. Can't you fix it?

742
01:20:42,479 --> 01:20:46,949
It's that fuckin' spick
that did this!
Fix it!

743
01:20:46,984 --> 01:20:49,416
Come on, man!
Fix what?

744
01:20:49,451 --> 01:20:54,456
Fix the box, man!
Come on! Fix it!
They tore the guts out!

745
01:20:54,491 --> 01:20:56,959
I can't fix it!
We got the book here!
We can fix it!

746
01:21:09,605 --> 01:21:11,590
The bastard.

747
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:26,455
Sarah!

748
01:21:27,656 --> 01:21:29,908
Willie!

749
01:21:31,410 --> 01:21:33,912
John!

750
01:21:59,438 --> 01:22:01,440
Let's keep moving.

751
01:23:19,436 --> 01:23:21,904
Hold down. Aw, fuck!

752
01:23:22,404 --> 01:23:25,372
What's goin' on?
That spick.

753
01:23:25,407 --> 01:23:27,659
He ripped these controls out,
the little yellow bastard.

754
01:23:27,694 --> 01:23:31,995
The little shit.

755
01:23:32,030 --> 01:23:34,498
The little fuckin' shit.

756
01:23:34,533 --> 01:23:37,536
You tried to make
a run for it.

757
01:24:12,204 --> 01:24:14,206
Holy shit.

758
01:24:14,706 --> 01:24:17,709
Holy fuckin' shit.

759
01:24:43,986 --> 01:24:46,989
Rhodes!

760
01:24:47,024 --> 01:24:49,992
Rhodes, you bastard!

761
01:27:17,088 --> 01:27:18,723
Oh, shit!

762
01:27:23,845 --> 01:27:26,848
Shit!

763
01:27:30,485 --> 01:27:32,487
Fuck!

764
01:27:36,858 --> 01:27:39,494
Ha, ha!

765
01:27:43,498 --> 01:27:47,502
Holy shit!

766
01:28:31,413 --> 01:28:33,415
Shit!

767
01:28:34,916 --> 01:28:37,384
Rhodes! Goddamn, Rhodes!

768
01:28:37,419 --> 01:28:40,422
Open the door,
you son of a bitch!

769
01:28:42,674 --> 01:28:44,809
Rhodes!

770
01:29:34,359 --> 01:29:36,861
Shit!

771
01:29:45,236 --> 01:29:47,704
Come on, Bub.

772
01:29:47,739 --> 01:29:51,242
Come on, you pus-brained
bag of shit.

773
01:29:51,743 --> 01:29:56,247
You wanna learn
how to shoot, Bub?
I'll teach you how to shoot.

774
01:29:56,381 --> 01:29:58,883
Come on, you bag of...

775
01:30:39,708 --> 01:30:43,712
Oh!

776
01:30:57,859 --> 01:31:00,862
Let's go. Follow the red lights.

777
01:31:13,992 --> 01:31:18,880
- It's temporarily
out of service.
- The ladder! Go ahead. Up, up.

778
01:31:18,915 --> 01:31:20,882
Up!

779
01:31:52,530 --> 01:31:54,998
Come along, Johnny.

780
01:31:55,033 --> 01:31:59,537
We're countin' on ya
to fly us to the promised land.

781
01:32:36,324 --> 01:32:39,711
Come on, come on.
Come on!

782
01:32:39,746 --> 01:32:42,714
Oh, shit!

783
01:32:55,727 --> 01:32:57,979
You fuck.

784
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:12,494
You pus fuck! You fuck!

785
01:33:14,996 --> 01:33:19,000
You pus fuck! You pus fuck!

786
01:33:28,009 --> 01:33:30,512
You f...

787
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:44,142
Come on!

788
01:33:45,143 --> 01:33:48,646
Come on! Come o-o-on!

789
01:33:51,282 --> 01:33:54,285
Come o-o-on!

790
01:33:55,286 --> 01:33:57,288
Come o-o-on!

791
01:34:00,291 --> 01:34:02,794
Come o-o-on!

792
01:34:03,795 --> 01:34:05,762
Come o-o-on!

793
01:34:50,842 --> 01:34:55,847
Salazar!

794
01:34:55,882 --> 01:34:58,850
Salazar!

795
01:36:15,293 --> 01:36:18,796
Let's hope
they filled up the gas tank
from the other night.

796
01:36:19,931 --> 01:36:22,934
Oh, my god.
Come on, come on!

797
01:36:37,565 --> 01:36:40,068
Get in, get in!

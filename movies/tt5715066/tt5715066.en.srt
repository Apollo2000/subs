2
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,005
Look at that guy!

3
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,645
A damn bum!

4
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,565
Hey, you! Are you lost?

5
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,579
Hey!

6
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,125
What the hell?

7
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,805
- Don't you turn your back on me...
Don't touch me!

8
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,885
English? What the hell?

9
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,240
You're telling me what to do?

10
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,125
Ole, stop it!

11
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,720
- Who do you think you are?
- Ole!

12
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,200
Hey, hey, I asked you a question.

13
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,360
Ole!

14
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,600
Get up!

15
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,160
If you touch me, you will burn.

16
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,499
Ole, stop messing around.

17
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,205
Get up, come on.

18
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,405
- Oh, shit! Ole!
- Call the police!

19
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,219
She said she wanted to do it.

20
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,205
No one's blaming you.
Not the parents, no one.

21
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,659
Everyone speaks highly of you.
Your colleagues, your clients.

22
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:25,325
Unfortunately these things happen.
Therapy doesn't always help.

23
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,005
You just started out, and that makes
such an experience particularly horrible.

24
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,139
I didn't believe her, Margrethe.
She said everything I needed to know.

25
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,939
- Didn't she have anyone else?
- No one. I could have stopped her.

26
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,299
This isn't your fault.

27
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,165
It was all there for me
to do the right thing. I didn't.

28
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,725
You had no control over her.

29
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,259
Someone's calling.

30
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,619
You should answer that.

31
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,125
Take some time off.
We'll talk tomorrow. Bye.

32
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,005
Hello. It's Christine Aas.

33
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,979
- Hi.
- Henrik. This way.

34
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,419
I have no experience with criminals.
I work mostly with teenagers.

35
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:56,619
No one expects a miracle. We only
have an hour before the Crime Unit arrives.

36
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,659
I hope we can make him talk
before they take him.

37
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,805
- What's his name?
- Eric Bergland.

38
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,339
Sounds familiar.

39
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,579
The fire in Årdal three years ago.
Five people died.

40
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,619
- It's him?
- Norwegian-American. Backpacker.

41
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,699
- In Norway looking for relatives.
- He's been in the woods all this time?

42
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,205
There are still many questions
regarding that fire.

43
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:27,059
But now we have three witnesses
saying he killed the boy.

44
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,925
They say he barely touched him,
and he collapsed and died.

45
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,405
- What has he said so far?
- Not a word.

46
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:49,005
- Any indication why this happened?
- The big question for me is how.

47
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,360
Eric, my name is Christine Aas,
I'm a psychologist, I...

48
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,600
I don't work for the police,...

49
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,880
...but they've asked me
to come here and talk to you.

50
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,800
Would you like
to come here and sit...

51
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,200
Eric?

52
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,000
Will you come
and sit with me, please?

53
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,040
My English is only so-so. Sorry.

54
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,480
I've never been to America, so...

55
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,440
You descend from Norwegians?

56
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,600
Many generations back, it seems.

57
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,320
How did you find
your family here? Online or...?

58
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,160
Eric?

59
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:40,040
A lot of people are wondering
what happened last night...

60
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,320
...with you and the boy.

61
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,760
I...

62
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,120
I don't think
you did anything wrong.

63
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,920
I think something
happened that...

64
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,840
...nobody quite understands yet.

65
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,920
But maybe you do?

66
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,240
I think that sometimes...

67
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,080
...bad things happen
to good people.

68
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,200
Awful things.

69
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,240
It's not their fault.

70
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,720
I think people are,
in their hearts, genuinely good.

71
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,760
I tried...

72
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,920
I did. I told him that...

73
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,960
But he didn't listen to me.
He didn't listen to me, you know.

74
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,640
I'm listening.

75
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,680
Tell me.

76
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,480
I tried to tell him.

77
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,440
It's my fault.

78
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,920
I tried to tell him
not to touch me.

79
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,480
And then he...

80
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,285
Henrik, let's remove the handcuffs.

81
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,125
Henrik... Ole's parents
are in the reception.

82
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,125
Bjørn refuses to leave
until he has spoken with you.

83
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,445
Remove his handcuffs and stay close.

84
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,125
Therese.

85
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,285
- I can't even begin to...
- Where is he?

86
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:35,179
I have to see him.
He killed my son. I have a right to...

87
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,579
We're still trying to understand
what really happened.

88
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,219
We know what happened.
The other boys saw the whole thing.

89
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:47,645
Yes, we have their statements.
Now we have to hear his side.

90
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,605
I just want to look him in the eyes. Once.

91
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,285
I'm sorry, Bjørn.

92
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,699
The Crime Unit is bringing
an American from the embassy.

93
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,805
They want to take him out of the country.

94
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,165
I'll be right outside.

95
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,120
They were all your relatives,
right?

96
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,600
The people at the farm?

97
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,440
Did everyone die?

98
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,320
Except you.

99
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,280
I was sure you knew.

100
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,640
I'm so sorry.

101
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,800
Eric.

102
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,440
What happened
at the farm in Ardal?

103
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,845
- Hi, I'm from Online News...
- You have no right to be here.

104
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,600
You know I killed them.

105
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,440
And I killed the man too.

106
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,680
I don't understand
how you could have.

107
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,080
That's impossible.

108
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,120
How do you do that?

109
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,800
I don't know.

110
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,600
<i>They were found burned.</i>

111
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,600
This... This doesn't prove...

112
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,920
- Eric!
- Do you believe me now?

113
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,400
What are you doing?

114
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,480
Eric, stop this!

115
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,600
- Stop it now.
- I can't.

116
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,400
It's your emotions!

117
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,320
Turn it off! Turn it off!

118
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,299
- You have to get out of here!
- No!

119
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:01,245
He needs help to stop this!
Turn off the alarm!

120
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,760
Eric, it's your emotions!
You're setting this off!

121
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,760
If you focus away
from your fears,...

122
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,600
...you can learn
how to control it!

123
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,680
It's coming from inside you,
so it's all up to you!

124
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,520
Isolate yourself from everything
around you! You control it!

125
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,160
Just breathe!
I know you can stop this!

126
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,365
Are you okay?

127
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,360
Eric, this is Cora Hathaway
from the U.S. Embassy.

128
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,720
She's here to help you
get back to America.

129
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,925
- They have no right to do that.
- It's not up to me.

130
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,920
Eric, you have to talk
to them now.

131
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,680
No, I just want to talk to you,
nobody else.

132
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,200
Christine.

133
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,800
Which is why we need
to sedate you, Eric.

134
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,800
I'll do it myself.

135
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,120
Eric?

136
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,965
Watch his head.

137
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,205
They are bringing Bergland
to the helicopter now.

138
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,405
You know we'll never understand
what happened in there?

139
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,899
Maybe we're not meant
to understand everything.

140
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,045
I'm thinking God has
a plan with Eric.

141
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,685
Put this behind you.
It's someone else's headache now.

142
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,080
<i>He's burning up.
The sedation is wearing off.</i>

143
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,080
Eric? Eric, relax.

144
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,680
We're taking you to Oslo
and then somewhere safe.

145
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,280
You'll be
well-taken care of, okay?

146
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,200
We're gonna find out
what's going on with you,...

147
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,280
...I promise.

148
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,760
Eric?
- Give him another dose!

149
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,440
<i>- Relax.
- I've already given him...</i>

150
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,720
<i>...maximum dosage.</i>

151
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,200
<i>Any more, and he could die.</i>

152
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,000
- Eric?
- Get me out of here!

153
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,240
Get me out of here!

154
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:42,045
Give him another dose now!

155
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,485
- Do it now!
Eric?

156
00:29:10,585 --> 00:29:13,560
Stop! Stop! Stop!

157
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,800
Stop!

158
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,120
Lie down!

159
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,520
Zero-Zero, emergency,
all main engines switches to off.

160
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,040
Override, Fox Two.

161
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,120
Mayday, mayday, mayday! Mayday,
mayday, mayday! Helicopter going down!

162
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,240
Helicopter Zero-Zero
going down...

163
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,760
Mayday, mayday, mayday! Zero-Zero, we're going
down! Mayday, mayday, mayday! We're going down!

164
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,600
Ditch, ditch, ditch!

165
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,160
Spin out, spin out. 1,200 feet. Ditch! Ditch!
Ditch! Get off, get off! Ditch, ditch, ditch!

166
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:11,219
We found three bodies in the wreckage.
We're bringing them out now.

167
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,445
- Did you find Bergland?
- No, not yet.

168
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,280
<i>I will try to do this
in English...</i>

169
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,400
<i>...since we have some
foreign people with us today.</i>

170
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,360
<i>As we have not yet contacted...</i>

171
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,880
<i>...the relatives
of the crash victims,...</i>

172
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,400
<i>...I can only say
that we have uncovered...</i>

173
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,440
<i>...three dead bodies
in the helicopter.</i>

174
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,280
<i>One American woman
is in hospital...</i>

175
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,920
<i>...with smaller injuries.</i>

176
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,000
<i>She's doing well
all things considered.</i>

177
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,680
<i>I also cannot tell you the status
of the other American.</i>

178
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,800
<i>But I'll keep you updated.</i>

179
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,840
<i>Okay. Thank you.
Bjørn?</i>

180
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:05,525
The helicopter was on its way
to Oslo with Bergland...

181
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,899
Where are you going?

182
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:18,165
The police confirm it is Eric Bergland
they're searching for in Odda.

183
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,880
Christine!

184
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,680
Eric?

185
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,040
I...

186
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,800
The helicopter crashed.

187
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,480
Are you okay?
Are you hurt anywhere?

188
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,040
I'm going to take you
to my friend's cabin...

189
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,680
...and we'll figure it out, okay?

190
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,400
I'll be right back.

191
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,520
I don't want to hurt you.

192
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,920
Eric?

193
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,760
How did this happen to you?

194
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,360
What is this?

195
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,160
Whoa, I'll just do it,
I don't want to zap you.

196
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,320
Hey, how do I say thank you
in Norwegian?

197
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,400
Norwegian?

198
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,200
<i>Tusen takk.</i>

199
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,400
<i>Tusen takk, Christine.</i>

200
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,760
Is there anyone you'd like
to call back in the U.S.?

201
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,000
When did it start?

202
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,800
At the farm.

203
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,120
I got there,...

204
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,680
...something just started
building up inside of me.

205
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,240
And then I just exploded,...

206
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,000
...and everything burst
into flames.

207
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,520
And...

208
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:58,640
It is crucial that you understand
how important it is...

209
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,960
...to the U.S. government
that you get Bergland.

210
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,760
You're lucky to be alive.

211
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,920
- That was some crash.
- Thank you.

212
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,600
Two minutes before we took off.

213
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,320
While we were in air
moments before we crashed.

214
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,720
You mean he had something
to do with this?

215
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,080
I saw it with my own eyes.

216
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,520
He created all that.
He made us crash.

217
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,560
He saved your life.

218
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,120
I'm not saying he's a bad person.
I don't care what he is.

219
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,640
We need to find him quickly
and get him under control.

220
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:13,845
Are you crazy?
He killed lots of people!

221
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,979
He didn't mean to hurt anyone.

222
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,819
- Christine! He's wanted!
- I know that.

223
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,699
You're helping a criminal!
You could go to prison!

224
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:30,525
Call the police
and explain what happened.

225
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,565
This could ruin your life!

226
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:37,419
Please call the police,
then call me when you've done it.

227
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,365
I have to hang up.

228
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,285
Let me know when you've done it?

229
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,219
- Hello?
- Okay.

230
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,845
Good.
Bye.

231
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,440
<i>Christine?</i>

232
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,280
<i>Christine?</i>

233
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,640
Christine?

234
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,360
- I didn't mean to...
- It's fine.

235
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,000
I was thinking a lot
about the farm.

236
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,880
- And I was thinking I should...
- Yeah.

237
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,640
What?

238
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,320
We have to go to the police
and you need to turn yourself in.

239
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,720
I just can't do this, it's...

240
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,880
I need to go home.

241
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,480
I can give you a ride back down
if you'd like.

242
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,520
And we could go in together.

243
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,560
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's alright...

244
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,760
...I understand.

245
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,280
- You snore a lot.
- I snore?

246
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,840
Sorry.

247
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,800
Christine...

248
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,960
Christine, I just want
to tell you that I'm... I'm...

249
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,440
I just had a thought that I
wanted it not to rain on you.

250
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,320
Let's not go to the police.

251
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,640
No. You've done enough for me.
I think you should go home.

252
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,320
I don't want to.

253
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,760
We should go to the farm.

254
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:29,819
Locals are still in shock after
yesterday's tragic events -

255
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:36,005
- that drew international attention
to the small Norwegian town.

256
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,920
What do you think will happen
when we get to the farm?

257
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,760
I don't know.

258
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:46,280
While I was there, it felt like
there was something...

259
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,280
...calling me.

260
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,320
It was calling me
towards something.

261
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:22,219
Welcome on board MS Askeland.
The crossing will take 15 minutes.

262
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:27,165
Food and drinks can be bought
in the canteen on the top deck.

263
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,120
I love ferries.

264
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,600
It's like taking a break from
the world for a few minutes.

265
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:24,939
The police are asking anyone in Odda who
have seen Eric Bergland to contact them.

266
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:28,499
He is a suspect
in yesterday's death in Odda.

267
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:33,299
The police say the public should not
approach him as he may be dangerous.

268
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:37,805
Bergland may be in the company
of this woman, Christine...

269
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,000
Eric?

270
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,520
Are you okay?

271
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,880
They know that I'm with you,
so we need to leave.

272
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,160
Now!

273
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,080
What were you doing?
You can't just leave like that.

274
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,360
Christine, the gas station,
the houses and the roads,...

275
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,880
...everything just disappears.

276
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,280
One minute it's all there,...

277
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,720
...and then the next
it's just all fields.

278
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,920
And the sky just becomes
a different color.

279
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,360
Sometimes I just get
pulled into these...

280
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,760
...these visions,
and I see things.

281
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,480
I can't really explain it, I
just see them,...

282
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,480
...it happened since the farm.

283
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,080
I can walk around,
I can touch things,...

284
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,920
I can feel things,
I feel the wind, the heat.

285
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,320
It's freezing,
it felt like I was freezing.

286
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,760
And these are places you've been?

287
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,840
No, they're not places I've been.

288
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,960
Some of these places
don't even seem possible,...

289
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,320
...like they're different worlds.

290
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,040
And in the background
the sky's filled...

291
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,120
...with this enormous shape
that looks like a...

292
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,120
- Like what?
- Like...

293
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,160
I know it sounds strange,
but it looks like a tree.

294
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,760
Like this enormous,
beautiful tree...

295
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,560
...that fills the entire horizon.

296
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,480
When you were sleeping
in the cabin,...

297
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,680
...I just kept thinking
about everything and...

298
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,200
Like, will it stay with you
for the rest of your life?

299
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,120
Where does it come from?

300
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,760
- Are you the next Jesus?
- Jesus didn't make people die.

301
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,760
You can do things
with the atmosphere...

302
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,800
...and air and water.

303
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,560
Who knows what else you can do?

304
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,280
Or what you can achieve if...

305
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,800
...if you learn
how to control it.

306
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,440
Just let me talk to him.

307
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,240
- Are you crazy?
- I...

308
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,040
It's my boyfriend,
he's very sick.

309
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,040
We need to get him to a hospital.

310
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,840
Just, please, help us.

311
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,880
Are you sure he's okay?

312
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:53,920
Yes.

313
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,040
He's... He's fine.

314
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,320
If they cross that bridge,
we lose them.

315
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,400
If we lose them,
they'll be in Bergen in no time.

316
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,160
We can't have a situation
in the tunnels...

317
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,160
...before the bridge,
that's too dangerous.

318
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,560
They cannot reach a city,
you do agree with me, right?

319
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:34,000
Just stop them
before they get to that bridge.

320
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,920
Please.

321
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,960
What's going on here?

322
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,160
Is this for you?

323
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,840
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

324
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,720
<i>Get out of the vehicle
with your hands in the air!</i>

325
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:37,040
<i>This is your last warning! Get
out with your hands in the air!</i>

326
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,360
I wish things were different.

327
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,880
Hands up! Over your head!
Get down!

328
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,600
Hands in the air!

329
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,240
Don't move!
Get down on the ground!

330
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,739
Stop, don't move!

331
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:26,699
- Don't shoot!
- Get down!

332
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:30,179
Don't shoot!

333
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:33,725
Put your weapons down!

334
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,880
- Don't! No! Don't touch her!
- Get down!

335
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,880
Take your hands off her!

336
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,560
Tell him to take his hands
off her!

337
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,080
- Show me your hands!
- Take your hands off her!

338
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:56,080
- Get down, or I'll have to shoot!
- Take your hands off her!

339
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,000
Eric? Can you hear me?

340
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,120
Stay down! Stay down!

341
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,120
Eric, listen to me!
You have to stop this!

342
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,920
Eric?

343
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,760
You have to focus on what you can
do and how you can control it.

344
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,720
Get down, don't get up!

345
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,960
You need to do what you did
at the police station...

346
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,080
...to make it all stop.

347
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,920
- On the ground!
- Keep all the noise out!

348
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,920
Stay down! Stop! Get down!

349
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,080
Stay down!

350
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:57,419
Help!

351
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:00,285
Help! Help!

352
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:05,085
We need a doctor! Help me!

353
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,645
Help me!

354
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,605
Is he alive?

355
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:34,565
I'll get you away from here. Both of you.

356
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:41,099
This is Henrik Jondal,
the sheriff in Odda.

357
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:43,859
I have to get Bergland
to the nearest hospital.

358
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:47,619
I want a confirmation from someone
official that no one will stop us.

359
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:52,125
If you don't let us through,
you will be held accountable if he dies.

360
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:58,325
One moment. We'll get back to you
with a formal statement.

361
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:08,725
We will let you through on the condition
that you go straight to Ulvik Hospital.

362
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:12,525
We will set up a security perimeter
around the hospital.

363
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,619
You should have told me
your plans.

364
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:28,965
You said there was nothing more
you could do. Why are you helping us now?

365
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,059
I have believed in God
my whole life.

366
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:38,445
If this has anything to do with him,
I don't want to be on the wrong side.

367
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:46,019
- Where were you going?
- To the farm.

368
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:50,539
- That burnt?
- He believes that is where it all started.

369
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:55,379
We're back with an update
from the police station in Hordaland.

370
01:03:55,380 --> 01:04:00,659
\Several police units attended a dramatic
arrest on Hardanger bridge -

371
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:05,245
\- when local extreme weather appeared
to hit the area around the bridge.

372
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,960
With all due respect, I disagree.

373
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:15,000
You haven't seen what I've seen.

374
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:20,960
Imagine in a few days when people
realize what he represents...

375
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,720
...or what he doesn't represent.

376
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:29,080
Imagine Christians, Muslims,
everyone who believes in God.

377
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:33,120
Suddenly a God-like human
proves they're all wrong.

378
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,360
He doesn't represent any of them.

379
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,760
What happens then?

380
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,520
I think that's the only thing
we can do.

381
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,560
I'll make sure it happens.

382
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:02,859
Witnesses claim that Eric Bergland
appeared to summon the storm.

383
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:09,339
In videos taken at the site Bergland
appears to control the lightning.

384
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:12,459
Social media are going wild
with speculation.

385
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:17,445
Several have drawn comparisons
between Bergland and the Norse god Thor.

386
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,520
Are they calling me Thor?

387
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,280
You can't blame them, can you?

388
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,139
The University in Bergen
rejects this claim...

389
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:26,419
He was an angry God,
but also a protector of mankind.

390
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:29,659
I'm here with Maja Gundersen.
You witnessed...

391
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:31,779
He will defeat everyone,
he's Thor!

392
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:35,739
Bergland has been sent
to Ulvik Hospital for treatment.

393
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:41,605
The police and army are securing the
site, the public are urged to keep away.

394
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:14,485
Ventricular fibrillation!

395
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:19,560
Eric?

396
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,480
Can you hear me?

397
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,360
<i>Eric?</i>

398
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,280
<i>- Christine? Where am I?
- We lost you.</i>

399
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,880
<i>We lost you but the doctors
got your heart going again.</i>

400
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,480
<i>They need to do an MR scan.</i>

401
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,520
No, please, will you just
let me out of here?

402
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:09,880
<i>No, we need to see
what's going on inside you.</i>

403
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,960
<i>I'm right here, Eric,
right outside.</i>

404
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,320
Just talk to me.

405
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,000
I was there again.

406
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:24,760
This time everything was frozen,
like an Ice Age.

407
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,640
It still had the same tree,
though.

408
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:36,299
What tree? What is he talking about?

409
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,405
Sometimes he gets these strange visions.

410
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,880
<i>Okay, Eric, try to relax,
we'll just turn the machine on.</i>

411
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:54,200
<i>Now we're scanning, there will be
some noises. Just relax.</i>

412
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:11,939
People have gathered outside Ulvik
Hospital, hoping to see Eric Bergland.

413
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:15,539
The police confirm that they are assisted
by the American government -

414
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:19,845
- and the National Guard
to prevent an escalation of the situation.

415
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:59,725
This looks wrong,
how can he be alive?

416
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:09,245
What was that?

417
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:12,360
- Eric?
- Please!

418
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:16,285
- You have to turn off the machine.
- It won't turn off.

419
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,360
Hold on, hold on!

420
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:25,445
What the hell!

421
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,005
Is everyone okay?

422
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,120
Eric, are you okay?

423
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:41,685
The boy in ICU2 has gone into cardiac
arrest. All the defibrillators are dead.

424
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,440
What did she say?

425
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,045
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

426
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,160
You're a monster!

427
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,480
You killed my only son.

428
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:43,685
Bjørn!
This is a big mistake!

429
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:48,605
Please. Don't do this.

430
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:58,920
I'm sorry.

431
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,880
I really am sorry.

432
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:08,040
I didn't mean to hurt him.

433
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,640
There is somebody else's kid
about to die...

434
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,760
...and you need to let me go
help them now.

435
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:41,840
Thank you.

436
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:13,565
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.

437
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,360
Can I try something, please?

438
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,240
No, no.
No, no.

439
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,605
Let him.

440
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,040
Please.

441
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,640
Thor is Norwegian!

442
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:05,920
Eric...

443
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,800
Touch me! Touch me, Eric!

444
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:57,819
The army is fencing off the farm
to keep the public away.

445
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:01,885
And to keep things safe for Eric.
For us all.

446
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,320
What do you think they expect
from me?

447
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:26,405
Read the page I've marked.

448
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,645
THOR WITH THE HAMMER

449
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:34,920
What?

450
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:37,560
Are you all right?

451
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:43,885
Aft...

452
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:48,200
After Thor and all the other gods
died at Ragnarok,...

453
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:51,920
...his two sons built a farm
on the ruins of Asgard...

454
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,080
...to restart their lives...

455
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:56,000
...and rescue all the knowledge
the gods possessed...

456
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,680
...to prepare for their return.

457
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,320
This place we're going to,...

458
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,760
...what if that is the farm
Thor's sons built?

459
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,880
What if that's the reason
you're connected to it?

460
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,920
What if you are his descendant?

461
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,280
Can I just have a minute, please?

462
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,840
Why don't the two of us go up
and have a look first?

463
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:55,379
It doesn't look that old.

464
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:58,245
There may have been many houses here
through all these years.

465
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:57,640
Do you remember anything?

466
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,960
I can't get up! I can't move!

467
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:21,885
We need help to dig here.

468
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:34,045
Yes. Sierra 2 Charlie
has arrived at the site.

469
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:39,365
They have requested an excavator
to dig under the fire plot. Over.

470
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,360
Ma'am? They're ready for you.

471
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:13,560
<i>Sierra 2 Charlie, we've got eyes
on target. Awaiting orders, over.</i>

472
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:19,040
If anything happens
that escalates the situation,...

473
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:22,160
<i>- ... we're gonna fire on him.
- Copy that.</i>

474
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:23,200
Like what?

475
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,920
I'm not sure yet.

476
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,080
It all happened so fast.

477
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:38,360
The house just lit on fire...

478
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:42,480
And I just watched
those people die...

479
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,040
It wasn't your fault.

480
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:12,685
Shouldn't we wait
for an archaeologist?

481
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:16,720
<i>Eric? I think we've found
a crypt or a cave.</i>

482
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,160
<i>We will go down first.</i>

483
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,040
<i>I don't want to risk
another fire.</i>

484
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:23,400
Stay here, and I'll let you know
if you should come.

485
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:26,800
Okay?

486
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,560
<i>Target is isolated.</i>

487
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,320
<i>Looks like they have found
something...</i>

488
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:38,560
<i>...underneath the fire plot.</i>

489
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:20,365
Runestones.

490
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:29,885
What is this place?

491
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:58,739
The knowledge of all the dead gods -

492
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:02,699
- which Thor's sons collected
after Ragnarok.

493
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:05,725
They were described as runes.

494
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:09,605
The Norse gods' own words.

495
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:44,805
Yggdrasil. The World Tree.

496
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:50,205
Which shows the nine worlds
of the Norse mythology.

497
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:26,405
It's time for Eric
to come down here.

498
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,600
It's your turn now.

499
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:36,160
See what it is and then get out
of there as quickly as you can.

500
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,160
<i>They're ready for you.</i>

501
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:15,400
Okay, Eric, follow the walkway
to the back wall.

502
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:18,240
There's a mural there
with a big tree on it.

503
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:24,920
<i>A box is in front of that mural.</i>

504
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:27,040
The workers,
they are equipped to open it.

505
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,600
<i>But please let them out of there
before you do anything.</i>

506
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:25,560
What is this?

507
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:28,400
I don't know.

508
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:35,920
Let's find out.

509
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:59,480
I think it's time for us
to leave.

510
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,560
<i>The workers are coming back out.</i>

511
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:15,080
<i>No visual on Bergland.
We assume he's still down there.</i>

512
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:27,240
<i>Christine? It's a hammer.</i>

513
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:03,440
<i>The workers are saying
Eric is now alone with the box.</i>

514
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:05,499
They say they've found a chest.

515
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:07,805
Did you hear that?
A chest!

516
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:02,600
<i>What's happening? Are you okay?</i>

517
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,640
The hammer is protecting me.

518
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,000
<i>Please come back up.</i>

519
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:29,680
<i>He's holding a hammer.
The object is a hammer.</i>

520
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:32,520
<i>I can see something in his hand.
Permission to fire.</i>

521
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,120
<i>We have civilians coming
to the site.</i>

522
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:52,120
<i>What's the order?</i>

523
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,400
Are we firing or what?

524
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,880
- Ma'am?
- Fire.

525
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:13,760
<i>Female casualty.</i>

526
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:19,280
Christine, stay with me!

527
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:22,760
Christine! No, no, no!
No, no, no!

528
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:04,925
The number of casualties following the
tragedy in Årdal is still unconfirmed.

529
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:07,000
<i>This is absolutely devastating.</i>

530
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:10,645
Norway is still in shock...

531
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:14,360
<i>The cult of Thor...</i>

532
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,800
<i>With the terrorist Eric Bergland
still at large...</i>

533
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:18,605
There is still no sign of Eric Bergland.

534
01:33:19,305 --> 01:34:19,819

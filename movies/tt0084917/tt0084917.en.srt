IS IT THE SAME KIND OF WANT?

840
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,774
YOU REALLY WANT TO
HAVE SEX WITH HER?

841
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,242
WELL, DO YOU?

842
00:42:29,312 --> 00:42:30,979
YES.

843
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,050
OF COURSE I DO.

844
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:42,624
ALL RIGHT.

845
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,093
IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME

846
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:47,596
IF YOUR MOTHER WANTS
TO BUY ME FOR YOU,

847
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:49,265
BUT SHE CAN'T COME ALONG.

848
00:42:49,299 --> 00:42:50,231
OH, NO...

849
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,233
I WON'T HAVE HER WATCH US.

850
00:42:52,302 --> 00:42:54,736
I'M STILL CATHOLIC,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

851
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:56,237
I DON'T INTEND TO WATCH.

852
00:42:56,306 --> 00:42:57,739
I'VE HEARD QUITE ENOUGH.

853
00:42:57,808 --> 00:42:59,240

859

WHY?

860

BECAUSE IT IS, THAT'S WHY.

861
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:12,699
THAT'S SILLY. IT'S HER BODY.

862
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,200
WHY SHOULDN'T SHE USE IT

863
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,304
THE WAY SHE WANTS TO?

864
00:43:18,428 --> 00:43:20,095

I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND IT.

918
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:18,319
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.
HE DOES WONDERS

919
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:20,366
WHEN HE'S WEARING
HIS MAGIC GLOVES.

920
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,789
IF HIS WIFE IS SAD,

921
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:24,792
HE TOUCHES HER WITH HIS
GLOVES, AND SHE'S HAPPY.

922
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:26,339
IF HIS CHILDREN ARE CRYING,

923
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:28,796
HE JUST TOUCHES
THEM, AND THEY SMILE.

924
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:30,798
BUT HE CAN'T FEEL THEM.

925
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:32,300
HE YEARNS TO FEEL.

926
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:35,303
HE CAN EVEN HOLD OFF
DEATH WITH HIS GLOVES,

927
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:36,804
BUT HE CAN'T FEEL LIFE.

928
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:39,573
SO HE TAKES OFF THE
GLOVES, AND HE DIES,

929
00:49:39,642 --> 00:49:42,377
BUT HE FINALLY FEELS LIFE

930
00:49:42,445 --> 00:49:45,746
AS HE'S FLYING INTO
THE ARMS OF DEATH.

931

IT MEANS, I LIKE IT.

FEEL RESPONSIBLE

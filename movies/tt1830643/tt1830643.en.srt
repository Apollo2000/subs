<i>...been keeping
a very close eye</i>

4
00:02:49,352 --> 00:02:51,521
<i>on the typhoon
over the last few days.</i>

5
00:02:51,556 --> 00:02:55,425
<i>It always was forecast to be a
very powerful, violent typhoon,</i>

6
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:57,527
<i>and that's turned out
to be exactly the case,</i>

7
00:02:57,562 --> 00:02:59,529
<i>and you can see it clearly
here on the satellite.</i>

8
00:02:59,564 --> 00:03:01,032
<i>See of course the eye
very well defined,</i>

9
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:02,667
<i>and around the eye,</i>

10
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,869
<i>well, we've got
some very ferocious wind</i>

11
00:03:04,902 --> 00:03:07,304
<i>that's been causing
incredible damage.</i>

12
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:11,274
<i>Gusts have been up to around
about 320 kilometers an hour,</i>

13
00:03:11,308 --> 00:03:13,410
<i>and it may landfall
pretty much at its peak,</i>

14
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,946
<i>and those gusts of winds,</i>

15
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:16,814
<i>well, throwing
the large objects around,</i>

16
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:18,381
<i>causing, uh,
structural damage,</i>

17
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:19,851
<i>widespread destruction.</i>

18
00:03:19,884 --> 00:03:21,753
<i>And it's not finished yet.</i>

19
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:24,555
<i>The typhoon
right now is quite far away,</i>

20
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:26,691
<i>with winds in the eye wall

21
00:03:26,724 --> 00:03:29,359
<i>over 200 kilometers per hour.</i>

22
00:03:29,392 --> 00:03:32,063
<i>The typhoon is due
to make landfall in 12 hours.</i>

23
00:03:33,396 --> 00:03:34,966
<i>That's 7 p.m. local time.</i>

24
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:36,801
<i>You need to evacuate</i>

25
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:39,003
<i>if you're in the path
of the typhoon immediately.</i>

26

Neil.

27
00:04:18,576 --> 00:04:19,677
Neil.

28
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,712
Neil, are you okay?

29
00:04:21,746 --> 00:04:22,914
Neil.

30
00:04:22,947 --> 00:04:24,048
Honey.

31
00:04:25,116 --> 00:04:26,083
Neil.

32
00:04:26,117 --> 00:04:28,518
Oh, my God.

33
00:04:28,553 --> 00:04:30,453
Look at this room.

34
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:33,490
Oh, my God.
Neil, we're late!

35
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:40,598
Neil, seriously,
get up!

36
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:42,399
<i>...large and violent typhoon</i>

37
00:04:42,432 --> 00:04:44,635
<i>makes its way
across the South China Sea.</i>

38
00:04:46,403 --> 00:04:48,573
<i>...make landfall
in Vietnam on Sunday.</i>

39
00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:50,975
<i>That really is the one to
watch over the next few days.</i>

40
00:04:51,008 --> 00:04:54,477
<i>Thank you, Michael.
The typhoon right now is quite far away.</i>

41
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,948
<i>However, if you live
in this zone over here,</i>

42
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:58,983
<i>you should be careful.</i>

43
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:00,952
Oh, that doesn't look good.

44
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:05,656
<i>...could potentially
make a direct hit.</i>

45
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,424
<i>The typhoon is due to make
landfall in 12 hours...</i>

46
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:08,491
Is that blood?

47
00:05:11,863 --> 00:05:13,598
What happened last night?

48
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:15,933
<i>If you're in the path
of the typhoon,</i>

49
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:18,769
<i>you need to evacuate,
get yourself somewhere safe.</i>

50
00:05:28,613 --> 00:05:30,581
Do you think we'll
still make the boat?

51
00:05:30,615 --> 00:05:32,116
Yeah, we'll make it.

52
00:05:38,623 --> 00:05:39,857
Did you buy me this?

53
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,994
I have no idea.

54
00:05:43,027 --> 00:05:45,596
Doesn't really look like
either of our tastes.

55
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,131
You know,
I can't even remember

56
00:05:47,164 --> 00:05:49,934
how we got back to the room
last night. Can you?

57
00:05:51,702 --> 00:05:55,472
No. The important thing
is we did, so good for us.

58
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,612
Oh, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

59
00:06:01,646 --> 00:06:03,480
This isn't right.

60
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:05,816
He has to turn towards the
water to get to the ferry.

61
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,952
Sir. Uh...

62
00:06:07,985 --> 00:06:09,620
<i>pai taing qua...</i>

63
00:06:09,654 --> 00:06:11,555
to ferry.

64
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:19,597
What did he say?

65
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,999
Something about a festival.

66
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:24,235
Do you know
of any festival?

67
00:06:24,268 --> 00:06:26,737
San Khabuga, but it's not
for another two weeks.

68
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:29,506
Oh, well, then he's padding
the fare by going the long way.

69
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:30,675
Hey, yeah, yeah.

70
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:31,609
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

71
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:38,916
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

72
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,184
<i>Rae...</i>

73
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:43,520
<i>rae ka pe sei saam rap.</i>

74
00:06:43,554 --> 00:06:44,989
Okay? Yeah?

75
00:06:45,022 --> 00:06:47,024
We pay you extra
for direct.

76
00:06:50,027 --> 00:06:52,196
Could you slow down,
please? I-I can't...

77
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:56,200
Hey, buddy, lis...
<i>Mi mae cha sakaal.</i>

78
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:58,669
Okay, no... no festival.

79
00:06:58,703 --> 00:06:59,770
Okay? No festival.

80
00:06:59,804 --> 00:07:01,772
Yes, ferry.
No festival.

81
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:03,708
- Ferry.
- Wait.

82
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:04,775
What is he doing?

83
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:08,212
You, get out!

84
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:10,881
No, no, no.
Sir, sir, we're sorry.

85
00:07:10,915 --> 00:07:12,817
We have to get
to the ferry, okay?

86
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,952
If you want more money,
we'll pay you.

87
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:15,987
No, no, no, no, no.

88
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,089
<i>Lakaa thos chanmi nuei.</i>

89
00:07:18,122 --> 00:07:19,090
Yeah?

90
00:07:20,324 --> 00:07:21,592
You get out!

91
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:24,028
Get out!

92
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,055
My passport and
my wallet are in here.

93
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:53,190
- You sure?
- Your passport, too.

94
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:58,329
And where is
my fucking phone?!

95
00:07:58,362 --> 00:08:00,998
- What...
- Hey, madame,

96
00:08:01,032 --> 00:08:02,833
no I.D., no board.

97
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:04,635
No, no, no.
Come on.

98
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:05,770
Sorry.

99
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:07,038
Next, please!

100
00:08:12,043 --> 00:08:13,944
Okay, let's just
retrace our steps.

101
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:16,313
When was the last time
you had your passport?

102
00:08:16,347 --> 00:08:18,082
Well, I paid for dinner,
remember,

103
00:08:18,115 --> 00:08:20,818
and then I put it away.

104
00:08:20,851 --> 00:08:22,920
I never
touched it again.

105
00:08:22,953 --> 00:08:24,889
Oh, no. Did I
leave it in the room?

106
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,323
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

107
00:08:26,357 --> 00:08:28,025
- I'm so stupid.
- We'll figure it out.

108
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:29,660
It's okay.

109
00:08:29,693 --> 00:08:31,228
W-We'll figure
something out.

110
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:36,801
I'm sorry, but we are already
late getting under way.

111
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:40,237
If you find your I.D.,
there is another boat at 7:00.

112
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:41,839
Well, what about the storm?

113
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,275
That's land.

114
00:08:44,308 --> 00:08:46,377
No, I saw it on TV.

115
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,814
There's a hurricane
or a typhoon coming.

116
00:08:49,847 --> 00:08:51,749
No, no, no. In 200 year,

117
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:54,051
we never had a typhoon
or hurricane.

118
00:08:54,085 --> 00:08:56,087
200 year.

119
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,255
Yeah. I know.
I read the brochure.

120
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:02,059
Enjoy one more day,
okay?

121
00:09:04,061 --> 00:09:05,196
Thanks.

122
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,311
Sweet.

123
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:22,880
Wait. Where's the luggage?

124
00:09:22,913 --> 00:09:23,981
Wait!

125
00:09:24,014 --> 00:09:25,382
Wait, wait, wait!
Our luggage!

126
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,918
Wait! Wait a minute!

127
00:09:27,952 --> 00:09:29,386
Hey! Can you stop them?!

128
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,089
Um, c-can you call
the boat back, please?

129
00:09:32,123 --> 00:09:34,959
They have our luggage.
They took our luggage.

130
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:36,927
No phone on the boat.

131
00:09:37,928 --> 00:09:39,096
Are you kidding me?

132
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,664
Don't worry.

133
00:09:40,698 --> 00:09:43,667
It will be waiting
for you on the other side.

134
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:14,431
Passports are gone.

135
00:10:14,465 --> 00:10:15,933
So's your phone.

136
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:23,807
Why don't we take
a walk on the beach?

137
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:27,211
Relaxed dress code.

138
00:10:27,244 --> 00:10:28,846
Optional, even.

139
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,081
It would have to be,

140
00:10:31,115 --> 00:10:33,017
because they took
most of our luggage.

141
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:37,321
Neil, we have to find
our passports.

142
00:10:37,354 --> 00:10:39,223
We have to take
the 7 p.m. ferry.

143
00:10:39,256 --> 00:10:41,225
We can cancel
the credit cards.

144
00:10:41,258 --> 00:10:42,760
Once we get back
to the mainland,

145
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:44,061
we can go
to the embassy.

146
00:10:44,094 --> 00:10:45,863
I mean, they must handle
this sort of thing

147
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:46,964
all the time, right?

148
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:50,501
Okay.

149
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:52,903
Hey, honey, relax.

150
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:25,296
Hey.

151
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:26,964
What's all this?

152
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,432
I started thinking.

153
00:12:28,465 --> 00:12:31,068
I must have taken some photos
last night. All right.

154
00:12:31,101 --> 00:12:33,003
Okay.

155
00:12:33,037 --> 00:12:35,139
Let's see if we can
figure out what happened.

156
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,408
This could get ugly.

157
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:38,809
Oh, great.

158
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,912
Here's dinner
at Hang-sen's.

159
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:43,414
Looking sober.

160
00:12:43,447 --> 00:12:45,382
Drinks at Ping-Pong's.

161
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,918
Dancing at this place,
looking very sexy.

162
00:12:47,951 --> 00:12:50,054
See, I remember all of this.

163
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,259
Whoa.

164
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:57,061
I was way drunk.

165
00:12:57,094 --> 00:12:58,529
You're deleting
all of this.

166
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:01,198
Shit, there's a video,

167
00:13:01,231 --> 00:13:02,466
2 1/2 hours long.

168
00:13:06,904 --> 00:13:08,339
<i>All right,
this is Neil Oliver</i>

169
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:10,174
<i>taking you
off the beaten path.</i>

170
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:14,612
<i>We are in a bar, uh,
off the coast of Thailand.</i>

171
00:13:18,515 --> 00:13:19,917
<i>Drinks.</i>

172
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,151
<i>Did you get
a good look, Neil?</i>

173
00:13:21,185 --> 00:13:22,219
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

174
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:26,023
- <i>Over here!</i>
- <i>What are you doing?</i>

175
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:28,392
- <i>We got an 18-hour flight.</i>
- <i>...is intense.</i>

176
00:13:28,425 --> 00:13:31,061
- <i>Are you sure?</i>
- <i>Oh, absolutely.</i>

177
00:13:31,095 --> 00:13:32,963
<i>Shh!</i>

178
00:13:32,996 --> 00:13:36,133
<i>The hot waitress is
trying to offer us a drink.</i>

179
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,102
- <i>Oh!</i>
- <i>It's Madee.</i>

180
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:41,939
<i>Hi, Madee!</i>

181
00:13:41,972 --> 00:13:44,375
<i>But it's still
an 18-hour flight.</i>

182
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:47,244
<i>Then stay.</i>

183
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:48,680
<i>Why leave paradise?</i>

184
00:13:48,713 --> 00:13:51,315
<i>Yeah. I mean,
why leave paradise?</i>

185
00:13:52,983 --> 00:13:56,120
<i>Uh, can you tell me
what exactly that is</i>

186
00:13:56,153 --> 00:13:57,988
<i>that you're
putting in there?</i>

187
00:13:59,223 --> 00:14:00,190
<i>Oh.</i>

188
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:01,693
<i>Oh. Oh, good.</i>

189
00:14:05,663 --> 00:14:07,297
This is like an
out-of-body experience.

190
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:08,666
I don't remember
any of this.

191
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,300
<i>And one
for you, too.</i>

192
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:11,669
- <i>No. I'm okay. I'm okay.</i>
- <i>Come on, baby.</i>

193
00:14:11,703 --> 00:14:13,270
- <i>Come on, baby.</i>
- <i>No, no.</i>

194
00:14:13,303 --> 00:14:15,239
<i>Okay. Well...</i>

195
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:18,942
<i>This is SangSom,
right?</i>

196
00:14:18,976 --> 00:14:20,477
<i>No, seiysla.</i>

197
00:14:20,511 --> 00:14:22,379
<i>Call it island magic.</i>

198
00:14:30,622 --> 00:14:32,356
<i>Oh, it's so smooth.
Thank you.</i>

199
00:14:34,158 --> 00:14:36,360
<i>Oh, what's this?</i>

200
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:42,099
- <i>Aww.</i>
- <i>Ah.</i>

201
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,500
<i>So sweet.</i>

202
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:47,004
<i>A gift.</i>

203
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:50,708
<i>For your brave deeds,
may you endure.</i>

204
00:14:50,742 --> 00:14:52,644
<i>It will bring you
good health.</i>

205
00:14:52,677 --> 00:14:54,111
<i>Brave... Brave deeds?</i>

206
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,413
<i>Brave enough
to do what, exactly?</i>

207
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:58,449
<i>Leave it on you always.</i>

208
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:00,083
<i>For good luck.</i>

209
00:15:00,117 --> 00:15:01,418
- <i>Wow, that's...</i>
- Guess we figured out

210
00:15:01,452 --> 00:15:03,253
where you got
the necklace.

211
00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:06,423
- <i>I've never seen...</i>
- <i>You've never... Excuse me.</i>

212
00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:08,192
<i>You stumped the expert.</i>

213
00:15:08,225 --> 00:15:10,360
<i>My husband is
a travel reporter.</i>

214
00:15:10,394 --> 00:15:12,529
<i>He's doing
a-a piece on the island.</i>

215
00:15:12,564 --> 00:15:15,199
- <i>It's why we're here.</i>
- <i>I-I'll do a piece on you.</i>

216
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:26,711
<i>Sweetheart,
you all right?</i>

217
00:15:26,744 --> 00:15:28,312
<i>No. No.</i>

218
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,214
<i>Are you joking?</i>

219
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:31,348
<i>You need help?</i>

220
00:15:31,381 --> 00:15:33,718
<i>Sweetheart?</i>

221
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:35,319
Hey!

222
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,054
<i>Hey, what did you give us?</i>

223
00:15:38,121 --> 00:15:39,156
<i>Hey!</i>

224
00:15:40,324 --> 00:15:42,125
<i>Yeah, come on. I got you.</i>

225
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,193
<i>Whoa.</i>

226
00:16:04,448 --> 00:16:05,415
<i>Neil?</i>

227
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:07,585
Where are we?

228
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:09,419
I have no idea.

229
00:16:20,665 --> 00:16:21,699
<i>Neil.</i>

230
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,644
What the fuck?

231
00:17:10,314 --> 00:17:12,215
What are you doing?

232
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,827
Neil...

233
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,327
what the fuck?!

234
00:17:57,361 --> 00:17:58,663
What the fuck?

235
00:17:58,696 --> 00:17:59,764
...the fuck.

236
00:18:02,366 --> 00:18:04,702
Christine,
would you wait?

237
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:06,203
Christine, wait!

238
00:18:07,872 --> 00:18:09,907
Christine,
please open the door.

239
00:18:12,944 --> 00:18:14,879
Open the door!

240
00:18:17,214 --> 00:18:19,751
Christine,
listen to me.

241
00:18:19,784 --> 00:18:21,318
We're okay.

242
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:22,820
We were drugged.
That's all.

243
00:18:25,288 --> 00:18:26,724
Christine, I would
never hurt you.

244
00:18:27,992 --> 00:18:29,661
Now, will you
open this?

245
00:18:29,694 --> 00:18:30,928
Oh, my God.

246
00:18:30,962 --> 00:18:32,496
Oh, my...

247
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:33,665
Oh, my God.

248
00:18:33,698 --> 00:18:35,566
Open up the door.

249
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,743
Christine.

250
00:18:45,777 --> 00:18:47,511
Christine, baby,
open the door.

251
00:18:50,414 --> 00:18:51,949
Christine,
I need to know you're all right.

252
00:18:55,318 --> 00:18:56,353
Christine!

253
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,355
Christine!

254
00:18:59,757 --> 00:19:01,726
Christine,
unlock the door.

255
00:19:15,973 --> 00:19:18,241
Christine!

256
00:19:18,275 --> 00:19:19,677
Neil!

257
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:21,311
Christine!

258
00:19:21,344 --> 00:19:22,680
Baby!

259
00:19:23,881 --> 00:19:25,348
Neil.

260
00:19:25,382 --> 00:19:27,317
Hey!

261
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,854
Oh, Jesus,
you're ice-cold.

262
00:19:32,023 --> 00:19:33,858
Honey...

263
00:19:33,891 --> 00:19:35,425
I want to go home.

264
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:37,895
Take me home.

265
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:40,832
It's all right.
It's all right.

266
00:19:40,865 --> 00:19:42,033
Let's get you
out of here.

267
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:44,234
Come on. Let's get
you out of here.

268
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:48,271
What the hell is this?!

269
00:19:48,305 --> 00:19:50,273
Look at the door,
Mommy!

270
00:19:50,307 --> 00:19:51,709
Nathida,
you stay there, okay.

271
00:19:51,743 --> 00:19:53,410
We booked this place
on Airbnb.

272
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:54,746
You're the Olivers.

273
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:57,014
You were supposed to be
checked out by now.

274
00:19:57,048 --> 00:19:58,950
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, she's fine.

275
00:19:58,983 --> 00:20:00,885
She's just...
She's feeling a little sick

276
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:02,954
and locked herself
in the... the bathroom.

277
00:20:02,987 --> 00:20:04,689
- We missed our boat.
- Okay.

278
00:20:04,722 --> 00:20:06,490
I'd like
to hear her say that.

279
00:20:07,692 --> 00:20:09,426
I'm okay.

280
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:37,588
It's from Samantha.

281
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:43,995
I called a cab.
He's 15 minutes away.

282
00:20:52,937 --> 00:20:55,505
Samantha,
the room is a mess.

283
00:20:55,539 --> 00:20:57,975
It's "Mom," sweetie.

284
00:20:58,009 --> 00:20:59,744
She likes to show off.

285
00:20:59,777 --> 00:21:02,412
Where did you get this?

286
00:21:02,445 --> 00:21:05,016
What did Mommy say about
touching other people's things?

287
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:07,919
Only to do it when
they're not looking.

288
00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:10,420
Oh, you're so smart.
Off you go.

289
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:30,041
She needs
to see a doctor

290
00:21:30,074 --> 00:21:32,475
Yeah, I can...
I can take care of her.

291
00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:35,545
I think it's best we get out of
your hair and go find a hotel.

292
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,648
Oh, you are not
gonna find a hotel.

293
00:21:37,682 --> 00:21:39,016
It's our busy season.

294
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,651
We have room. It's fine.

295
00:21:40,685 --> 00:21:41,953
Listen,

296
00:21:41,986 --> 00:21:43,554
I know the doctor
on the island.

297
00:21:43,588 --> 00:21:45,556
I can get you in
today if you want.

298
00:21:59,604 --> 00:22:01,504
Hey.

299
00:22:05,943 --> 00:22:08,646
Uh, any English?

300
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:09,647
A little.

301
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,148
You are no Thai?

302
00:22:11,182 --> 00:22:13,818
No, I'm American.

303
00:22:13,851 --> 00:22:15,720
You American.

304
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:42,146
Ahhhh.

305
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:46,918
Ahhhh.

306
00:22:49,553 --> 00:22:51,454
Ahh.

307
00:22:53,858 --> 00:22:55,860
- Good.
- Okay.

308
00:22:55,893 --> 00:22:59,230
Doc, listen. We were
dosed with something,

309
00:22:59,263 --> 00:23:00,798
given a strange drink.

310
00:23:00,831 --> 00:23:02,667
She was very sick
this morning.

311
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,135
She was... She was
vomiting dirt.

312
00:23:04,168 --> 00:23:06,037
Dirt.

313
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:16,479
I think <i>Nam Mun Prai.</i>

314
00:23:16,513 --> 00:23:17,480
<i>Nam Mun Prai.</i>
What's...

315
00:23:17,514 --> 00:23:18,883
What <i>Nam Mun...</i>

316
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:20,151
<i>Nam Mun Prai.</i>

317
00:23:20,184 --> 00:23:21,218
Okay.

318
00:23:21,252 --> 00:23:23,020
N-A-M...

319
00:23:23,054 --> 00:23:24,722
M-U-N...

320
00:23:24,755 --> 00:23:26,590
P-R-A-I.

321
00:23:29,126 --> 00:23:31,494
Okay. It's, uh...

322
00:23:31,528 --> 00:23:33,030
It's a hard-core
Buddhist drink,

323
00:23:33,998 --> 00:23:35,132
It's very poisonous,

324
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,667
and it's
a powerful hallucinogen.

325
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:39,904
You, hallucination.

326
00:23:39,937 --> 00:23:41,205
Paranoia, vomiting...

327
00:23:41,238 --> 00:23:43,007
basically everything
except death.

328
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,009
Nope, death as well
if you drink too much.

329
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:46,744
You think
this was a hallucination?

330
00:23:46,777 --> 00:23:48,212
Show him the video.

331
00:24:08,933 --> 00:24:10,801
Hollywood.

332
00:24:10,835 --> 00:24:12,903
No. No, he...

333
00:24:12,937 --> 00:24:14,605
- thinks it's a film.
- No.

334
00:24:18,342 --> 00:24:20,177
This is a real video,
okay?

335
00:24:20,211 --> 00:24:21,779
It's real.
It's not Hollywood.

336
00:24:21,812 --> 00:24:23,781
Real video.

337
00:24:23,814 --> 00:24:24,782
Yeah, real video.

338
00:24:24,815 --> 00:24:25,783
These bruises
are real.

339
00:24:25,816 --> 00:24:27,284
I choked her, okay?

340
00:24:27,318 --> 00:24:28,919
I can't remember it.

341
00:24:28,953 --> 00:24:31,022
I can't remember
the last 12 hours.

342
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:44,802
Take.

343
00:24:44,835 --> 00:24:45,970
I'm not going
to drink this.

344
00:24:46,003 --> 00:24:47,171
Everything will be okay.

345
00:24:47,204 --> 00:24:48,973
- I'm not drinking this.
- No.

346
00:25:01,118 --> 00:25:04,989
Bad medicine
on our island.

347
00:25:11,195 --> 00:25:12,797
Very good food.

348
00:25:21,272 --> 00:25:23,140
Turn it off.

349
00:25:23,174 --> 00:25:24,775
Turn it off!

350
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:26,243
I-I don't even understand
what I'm seeing.

351
00:25:26,277 --> 00:25:28,679
Yeah? Well, it looks
a lot like you to me.

352
00:25:28,712 --> 00:25:30,948
You know that's
not me, right?

353
00:25:30,981 --> 00:25:33,084
I was throwing up
dirt, Neil.

354
00:25:33,117 --> 00:25:34,285
Well, you were
covered in it.

355
00:25:34,318 --> 00:25:35,786
You must have
swallowed some of it...

356
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,655
And what about
these bruises on my neck?

357
00:25:37,688 --> 00:25:38,756
They're from you.

358
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:39,990
From me?

359
00:25:40,024 --> 00:25:41,692
What's on this video
is impossible.

360
00:25:41,725 --> 00:25:43,794
We watched you
snap my neck!

361
00:25:43,828 --> 00:25:46,197
Do you understand
how insane that sounds?

362
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:49,233
You're standing here right in front of
me, and you're fine.

363
00:25:50,935 --> 00:25:52,770
Look,
what's on this video,

364
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:56,974
there must be a less crazy
explanation for what we're seeing.

365
00:25:57,007 --> 00:25:57,975
Right?

366
00:26:02,413 --> 00:26:03,914
Neil?

367
00:26:04,949 --> 00:26:06,050
Neil?!

368
00:26:11,422 --> 00:26:13,324
Neil?!

369
00:26:13,357 --> 00:26:14,391
Oh, my God.

370
00:26:17,895 --> 00:26:20,364
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

371
00:26:20,397 --> 00:26:22,900
Cafe is like
a two-minute walk from here

372
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:24,869
Wait.
Wh-Where did you go?

373
00:26:24,902 --> 00:26:26,837
Where were you
just now?

374
00:26:26,871 --> 00:26:28,172
What are you talking about?
I just...

375
00:26:28,205 --> 00:26:29,240
Christine, are you okay?
Come here.

376
00:26:29,273 --> 00:26:30,341
- Don't.
- What?

377
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,044
Look...

378
00:26:35,146 --> 00:26:37,081
I understand
you're scared, okay?

379
00:26:37,114 --> 00:26:40,084
I-I'm scared, too,
but don't be scared of me.

380
00:26:40,117 --> 00:26:42,052
I would never
intentionally hurt you.

381
00:26:44,155 --> 00:26:45,389
If you want some space,

382
00:26:45,422 --> 00:26:47,124
I can go and try
and find the passports.

383
00:26:47,158 --> 00:26:49,727
Are you seriously suggesting
that we split up right now?

384
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,328
- No, I'm just saying...
- You know what?

385
00:26:51,362 --> 00:26:52,796
Just go take
your pictures, Neil,

386
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,165
'cause that's
what you wanna do.

387
00:26:54,198 --> 00:26:57,101
I'm just trying
to do the right thing.

388
00:26:57,134 --> 00:26:59,270
I... Only I don't know
what that is.

389
00:27:07,244 --> 00:27:08,846
I just wanna go home.

390
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:10,347
Seven p.m. tonight,
we're getting on that ferry,

391
00:27:10,381 --> 00:27:12,116
and we're getting
the hell out of here.

392
00:27:17,788 --> 00:27:19,890
I'm sorry. I...

393
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:23,127
I don't have
any other words.

394
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,330
I don't know
what happened last night,

395
00:27:26,363 --> 00:27:27,765
but whatever it was...

396
00:27:29,466 --> 00:27:30,868
I'm sorry.

397
00:27:48,986 --> 00:27:50,821
Is this
the mystery festival?

398
00:27:57,027 --> 00:27:58,195
Yeah, I guess.

399
00:27:58,229 --> 00:28:00,130
You're welcome
to get closer.

400
00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:03,901
Miss,
I feel dumb for asking,

401
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:07,071
but what festival
is this? Miss?

402
00:28:14,845 --> 00:28:16,313
Bon appétit!

403
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:22,052
Did you see the way
she looked at this?

404
00:28:22,086 --> 00:28:23,320
Yeah.

405
00:28:24,321 --> 00:28:26,156
So creepy.

406
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,324
I'm done.

407
00:28:37,401 --> 00:28:38,936
Go.

408
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:40,104
It's why you came here.

409
00:28:41,138 --> 00:28:42,873
It's fine.

410
00:28:42,906 --> 00:28:44,041
You're the best.

411
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:51,135
This is Neil Oliver.

412
00:30:51,168 --> 00:30:52,604
It's, uh, May 10,

413
00:30:52,637 --> 00:30:54,438
a day of no significance

414
00:30:54,471 --> 00:30:56,608
on the Thai
or Buddhist calendars,

415
00:30:56,641 --> 00:30:59,410
but as you can see, the...

416
00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:01,579
the islanders are celebrating.

417
00:31:01,613 --> 00:31:03,514
Something... Hey! Hey! Hey!

418
00:31:05,482 --> 00:31:07,117
God!

419
00:31:47,524 --> 00:31:48,726
Hey!

420
00:31:52,229 --> 00:31:53,497
What are you doing?

421
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:54,632
God.

422
00:32:15,753 --> 00:32:18,088
- Where is my wife?
- The bathroom.

423
00:32:33,437 --> 00:32:35,506
Christine, honey, we need to leave.

424
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:36,608
Chris...

425
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:46,250
Christine!

426
00:32:58,596 --> 00:32:59,797
Christine!

427
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,275
Christine!

428
00:33:22,152 --> 00:33:23,453
Christine!

429
00:33:50,147 --> 00:33:51,181
Christine!

430
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:55,218
Hey. Have you seen her?

431
00:33:58,556 --> 00:34:00,324
Hey. Have you seen her?

432
00:34:00,357 --> 00:34:01,593
Mr. Oliver!

433
00:34:01,626 --> 00:34:03,193
We found your wife!

434
00:34:07,397 --> 00:34:08,365
Christine!

435
00:34:14,438 --> 00:34:15,472
Christine?

436
00:34:15,505 --> 00:34:16,641
Christine, sweetheart.

437
00:34:16,674 --> 00:34:17,842
Say something.

438
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:19,644
- Her arm!
- I got you. Got you.

439
00:34:19,677 --> 00:34:21,278
Yeah, I can see
her fuckin' arm.

440
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:22,546
Ah, it's okay.

441
00:34:25,515 --> 00:34:27,685
What the fuck
happened to her, huh?

442
00:34:30,822 --> 00:34:32,456
Sorry.

443
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:33,758
Sorry.

444
00:34:33,791 --> 00:34:34,759
Hurts.

445
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:36,426
Aw, what happened?

446
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,261
Huh?
Come on, sweetie.

447
00:34:38,295 --> 00:34:41,198
I-I must have looked around the
entire town looking for you.

448
00:34:41,231 --> 00:34:43,668
Where'd you go, huh?

449
00:34:43,701 --> 00:34:45,369
God.

450
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:48,873
Did you put this back on me?

451
00:34:48,906 --> 00:34:50,708
What? No.

452
00:34:50,742 --> 00:34:53,477
I left it on the table
at the cafe.

453
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,747
Why won't you tell me
what happened?

454
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,447
You won't believe me.

455
00:34:58,415 --> 00:34:59,717
What are you
talking about?

456
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:01,819
After today, try me.

457
00:35:07,558 --> 00:35:09,861
Let's go get this
bandaged properly, okay?

458
00:35:16,601 --> 00:35:18,301
When I got my vision back,

459
00:35:18,335 --> 00:35:20,571
I looked up at them, and they
were completely faceless.

460
00:35:20,605 --> 00:35:22,674
Their eyes were sewn shut.

461
00:35:22,707 --> 00:35:23,941
Their mouths were sewn shut.

462
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:27,912
I sound totally crazy.

463
00:35:27,945 --> 00:35:29,914
No. No, look...

464
00:35:29,947 --> 00:35:31,381
I believe you.

465
00:35:31,415 --> 00:35:32,449
Check this out.

466
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:35,318
It looks just like you.

467
00:35:35,352 --> 00:35:36,788
- Kind of.
- Yeah.

468
00:35:45,262 --> 00:35:47,264
- Wait. She gave me the necklace.
- Christine...

469
00:35:47,297 --> 00:35:48,566
Hey!

470
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:50,601
Hey!

471
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,775
Excuse me.

472
00:36:30,808 --> 00:36:32,910
There was a woman
who just left here.

473
00:36:32,944 --> 00:36:35,479
Can you tell us
something about her?

474
00:36:40,651 --> 00:36:42,053
Chakrii...

475
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:46,724
My son.

476
00:36:48,092 --> 00:36:49,493
Needs a doctor,
don't you think?

477
00:36:50,828 --> 00:36:52,797
No, just rest.

478
00:36:53,931 --> 00:36:55,666
What do you know
about this necklace?

479
00:36:57,467 --> 00:36:58,703
Anything?

480
00:37:07,544 --> 00:37:09,312
Hey, hey, easy.
Easy.

481
00:37:15,753 --> 00:37:16,788
Okay.

482
00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:19,757
Thank you.

483
00:37:27,732 --> 00:37:29,000
What the fuck was that?

484
00:37:29,033 --> 00:37:31,569
It's an honor on our island,

485
00:37:31,602 --> 00:37:34,538
special gift
for celebrated guest.

486
00:37:34,572 --> 00:37:35,539
A celebrated guest?

487
00:37:35,573 --> 00:37:37,809
I'm a tourist,
all right?

488
00:37:37,842 --> 00:37:38,910
Do you know Madee?

489
00:37:38,943 --> 00:37:41,078
The woman
who just left here,

490
00:37:41,112 --> 00:37:42,546
she gave this to me.

491
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,481
You want to thank her?

492
00:37:44,514 --> 00:37:46,117
Yes. I want to thank her

493
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,885
for the 12 hours
that have gone missing

494
00:37:47,919 --> 00:37:49,352
since she gave me
this necklace.

495
00:37:49,386 --> 00:37:50,755
Our passports
have been stolen.

496
00:37:50,788 --> 00:37:52,522
I was gone again
for another hour.

497
00:37:52,557 --> 00:37:53,791
My husband looked
for me everywhere.

498
00:37:53,825 --> 00:37:54,826
He couldn't find me.

499
00:37:54,859 --> 00:37:56,561
He didn't know
where I was!

500
00:37:56,594 --> 00:37:58,830
I've been seeing shit that I
don't even know is real!

501
00:37:58,863 --> 00:38:00,631
It's all right.

502
00:38:03,568 --> 00:38:08,072
Look, we just want
to know one thing, okay?

503
00:38:08,105 --> 00:38:09,874
Tell us
how to find Madee.

504
00:38:24,121 --> 00:38:25,388
Madee's bar.

505
00:38:26,489 --> 00:38:28,491
I don't recommend you go.

506
00:38:28,525 --> 00:38:30,561
It's not for westerners.

507
00:38:30,595 --> 00:38:32,663
Yeah, well,
it's too late,

508
00:38:32,697 --> 00:38:34,431
'cause I think
we've already been.

509
00:39:39,096 --> 00:39:42,600
Ms. Christina,
Mr. Neil.

510
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:43,834
What surprise.

511
00:39:43,868 --> 00:39:45,002
You ran from us.

512
00:39:45,036 --> 00:39:46,904
Run from you?

513
00:39:48,139 --> 00:39:49,640
We all look alike,
right?

514
00:39:49,674 --> 00:39:51,508
Come. Come.

515
00:40:01,552 --> 00:40:03,154
Neil, that looks
like my dress.

516
00:40:09,727 --> 00:40:12,596
I try to find you.

517
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,799
You went home fast,
and you forgot it.

518
00:40:14,832 --> 00:40:17,500
Oh, yeah, it must have
been really tough

519
00:40:17,534 --> 00:40:19,937
to find two foreigners
in a town this big, huh?

520
00:40:19,971 --> 00:40:24,008
Everybody
are foreigners here.

521
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:25,876
I came from
somewhere else...

522
00:40:27,645 --> 00:40:28,846
as did many.

523
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:33,084
Wait. Wh-Where's the other...

524
00:40:33,117 --> 00:40:35,518
Where's...
Where's my wife's passport?

525
00:40:35,553 --> 00:40:36,754
Only you.

526
00:40:36,787 --> 00:40:38,656
What? Listen.

527
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:41,058
After we left here
last night,

528
00:40:41,092 --> 00:40:43,694
I choked my wife and then
buried her in a ditch.

529
00:40:50,134 --> 00:40:52,770
Kinky.

530
00:40:52,803 --> 00:40:54,905
That's what happen when
you ride the <i>manu miti.</i>

531
00:40:54,939 --> 00:40:56,674
The what?

532
00:40:56,707 --> 00:40:57,875
Dream bird.

533
00:40:57,908 --> 00:41:01,879
They say it...
it opens up your mind,

534
00:41:01,912 --> 00:41:03,714
free your soul.

535
00:41:03,748 --> 00:41:05,750
But I wouldn't touch it.

536
00:41:06,784 --> 00:41:08,518
Too many side effects.

537
00:41:10,154 --> 00:41:12,189
Like hallucination,

538
00:41:12,223 --> 00:41:14,959
scramble the brain.

539
00:41:14,992 --> 00:41:18,129
So you wouldn't take it,
but you serve it?

540
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,002
My friend,
you're the one

541
00:41:25,036 --> 00:41:27,571
who asked
for the drink yourself,

542
00:41:27,605 --> 00:41:29,140
and I rewarded you...

543
00:41:29,173 --> 00:41:30,841
for your bravery.

544
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:32,143
Take your bravery back.

545
00:41:32,176 --> 00:41:34,111
No.

546
00:41:34,145 --> 00:41:36,313
It's not yours
to give.

547
00:41:36,347 --> 00:41:38,182
What the hell
does that even mean?

548
00:41:38,215 --> 00:41:40,184
I am so sick
of this cryptic bullshit.

549
00:41:49,026 --> 00:41:50,661
What happened last night?

550
00:41:50,694 --> 00:41:53,164
And where is my passport?

551
00:41:55,332 --> 00:41:57,668
I think we should
get out of here.

552
00:42:05,276 --> 00:42:06,710
I'll see you around.

553
00:43:28,726 --> 00:43:32,096
Hey, one of Samantha's
neighbors is a fisherman.

554
00:43:32,129 --> 00:43:34,331
He's gonna take us
to the mainland now.

555
00:43:34,365 --> 00:43:35,833
What? Really?

556
00:43:37,301 --> 00:43:38,335
No!

557
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:41,372
You can't go.

558
00:43:41,405 --> 00:43:43,174
Isn't
the ferry at 7:00?

559
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:45,776
We found another boat that
will take us off the island.

560
00:43:45,809 --> 00:43:48,045
They have to go back
to their own home, sweetie.

561
00:43:49,346 --> 00:43:51,949
Why don't you help Neil
with the bags, okay?

562
00:43:51,982 --> 00:43:54,084
O-Okay. Uh...

563
00:43:54,118 --> 00:43:55,886
lead the way.

564
00:43:58,155 --> 00:43:59,924
He'll make a great father.

565
00:44:05,429 --> 00:44:07,131
Thank you
for everything.

566
00:44:07,164 --> 00:44:08,432
Oh...

567
00:44:08,465 --> 00:44:10,234
And the juice made me
feel so much better.

568
00:44:10,267 --> 00:44:11,936
Oh, yeah?
Island magic, right,

569
00:44:11,969 --> 00:44:14,038
just like your necklace.

570
00:44:15,339 --> 00:44:18,075
What is that?
Is that a real thing?

571
00:44:18,108 --> 00:44:20,211
Or is that
just superstition?

572
00:44:21,278 --> 00:44:22,846
I mean,
I used to think so.

573
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,848
But I used to be
really sick.

574
00:44:24,882 --> 00:44:27,818
I went to a specialist
in America, Canada, China.

575
00:44:27,851 --> 00:44:31,021
Finally someone said
I should come to this island.

576
00:44:31,055 --> 00:44:32,289
I had no idea
what to expect.

577
00:44:32,323 --> 00:44:33,891
I mean, I thought
I was gonna meet

578
00:44:33,924 --> 00:44:35,526
a witch doctor or something,
not that I care.

579
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,895
I mean, at that point,
everything was on the table.

580
00:44:37,928 --> 00:44:41,031
But, uh, I got here.

581
00:44:42,499 --> 00:44:44,468
I don't know.
It was the best thing for me.

582
00:44:44,501 --> 00:44:45,836
I haven't been sick since.

583
00:44:45,869 --> 00:44:48,205
So whether you
call that clean air,

584
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:50,241
climate, or magic,
I'll take it.

585
00:44:50,274 --> 00:44:52,309
Well, listen.

586
00:44:52,343 --> 00:44:54,445
I-I'm not a believer.

587
00:44:54,478 --> 00:44:56,213
You clearly are, so...

588
00:44:56,247 --> 00:44:58,249
why don't you
just take this?

589
00:44:58,282 --> 00:45:00,184
I can't, no.

590
00:45:00,217 --> 00:45:02,820
It's, uh...
It's not meant for me.

591
00:45:02,853 --> 00:45:05,356
You should probably
just keep it for good luck.

592
00:45:08,459 --> 00:45:09,860
Right.

593
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,364
Well, look, if you're
ever in Boston...

594
00:45:13,397 --> 00:45:16,800
Ah, I did 26 years
in Minnesota,

595
00:45:16,834 --> 00:45:18,502
so if you're lucky
enough to find paradise,

596
00:45:18,535 --> 00:45:20,170
why try to leave, right?

597
00:46:02,614 --> 00:46:05,149
Hey. I was
just thinking.

598
00:46:05,182 --> 00:46:06,551
No one knows
where we are.

599
00:46:06,584 --> 00:46:08,018
What are you talking about?

600
00:46:08,052 --> 00:46:09,621
Well, we were supposed
to be on a flight

601
00:46:09,654 --> 00:46:11,589
to the States
this afternoon.

602
00:46:11,623 --> 00:46:13,090
Let me borrow
your phone.

603
00:46:15,993 --> 00:46:17,194
Honey?

604
00:46:17,227 --> 00:46:18,262
Your phone.

605
00:46:19,263 --> 00:46:20,497
Who are you gonna call?

606
00:46:20,531 --> 00:46:21,999
My Dad. My sister.

607
00:46:22,032 --> 00:46:23,367
The FBI. I don't know.

608
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,969
Who did the guy
in <i>The Wicker Man</i> call?

609
00:46:26,003 --> 00:46:28,439
No one. They
burned him to death.

610
00:46:28,472 --> 00:46:30,040
Oh, yeah.

611
00:46:30,074 --> 00:46:32,343
He didn't have
a cell phone, though.

612
00:46:32,376 --> 00:46:34,945
I'm gonna try
and get reception.

613
00:46:34,978 --> 00:46:36,080
I love you.

614
00:46:58,435 --> 00:46:59,937
Come on.

615
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:01,138
Come on, come on, come on.

616
00:47:28,566 --> 00:47:29,601
<i>This is Neil Oliver</i>

617
00:47:29,634 --> 00:47:31,669
<i>taking you off the beaten path.</i>

618
00:47:31,703 --> 00:47:33,537
<i>For my travel companion
and I,</i>

619
00:47:33,571 --> 00:47:36,073
<i>there's no hope of us
ever leaving this island.</i>

620
00:47:36,106 --> 00:47:37,575
- What the fuck?
- <i>Christine,</i>

621
00:47:37,609 --> 00:47:39,644
<i>we're about to die
horrible deaths.</i>

622
00:48:08,439 --> 00:48:09,540
Neil?

623
00:48:42,674 --> 00:48:44,308
Neil!

624
00:49:07,699 --> 00:49:09,166
Neil!

625
00:49:59,684 --> 00:50:01,485
Where's my husband?

626
00:50:03,788 --> 00:50:05,757
No, where's my husband?

627
00:50:07,592 --> 00:50:08,626
My husband!

628
00:50:12,129 --> 00:50:13,163
There was a boat!

629
00:50:14,197 --> 00:50:16,099
Where did he go?!

630
00:50:17,735 --> 00:50:18,770
Neil!

631
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:22,640
No, he...

632
00:50:29,914 --> 00:50:31,381
Where is he?

633
00:50:34,652 --> 00:50:36,486
I-I saw him.

634
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,589
He...

635
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:42,159
He cut...
He cut himself open,

636
00:50:42,192 --> 00:50:43,728
and then he...

637
00:50:43,761 --> 00:50:46,664
he fell off
the end of the dock

638
00:50:51,903 --> 00:50:53,638
See this blood?

639
00:50:53,671 --> 00:50:55,272
This is...
This is his blood.

640
00:50:55,305 --> 00:50:57,441
H-He's on the dock.

641
00:50:57,474 --> 00:50:59,744
Uh...

642
00:50:59,777 --> 00:51:01,411
- Fish. Fish.
- No.

643
00:51:01,445 --> 00:51:03,681
No! No!

644
00:51:03,715 --> 00:51:05,248
How did
nobody see this?

645
00:51:06,784 --> 00:51:07,919
The tide
is out then.

646
00:51:07,952 --> 00:51:09,152
There couldn't
have been a boat.

647
00:51:09,186 --> 00:51:10,354
There was a boat.

648
00:51:10,387 --> 00:51:11,623
Oh, God.

649
00:51:12,624 --> 00:51:14,659
Hey! You!

650
00:51:14,692 --> 00:51:16,594
You saw the boat
and the water!

651
00:51:16,628 --> 00:51:18,328
You saw me, right,

652
00:51:18,362 --> 00:51:20,297
and my husband
on the dock?

653
00:51:21,566 --> 00:51:23,333
Uh...

654
00:51:25,268 --> 00:51:28,205
Christine...

655
00:51:28,238 --> 00:51:29,272
...Neil.

656
00:51:30,975 --> 00:51:32,744
He... He said one.

657
00:51:32,777 --> 00:51:34,511
He said it was
just you, not Neil.

658
00:51:34,544 --> 00:51:35,647
He said only one.

659
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,583
Wh-What is he trying to do?

660
00:51:39,617 --> 00:51:40,618
What is he trying to do?

661
00:51:40,652 --> 00:51:41,786
What is...

662
00:51:41,819 --> 00:51:43,721
- Just calm down, please.
- Oh, God.

663
00:51:45,288 --> 00:51:46,323
Witnesses
heard you screaming.

664
00:51:46,356 --> 00:51:47,424
Wait. Where's his phone?

665
00:51:47,457 --> 00:51:48,458
His... His phone?

666
00:51:50,293 --> 00:51:51,763
- You camera?
- No, his phone.

667
00:51:51,796 --> 00:51:52,764
On him.

668
00:51:52,797 --> 00:51:54,599
No, I had it.

669
00:51:54,632 --> 00:51:56,199
I had it.
Somebody took it.

670
00:51:57,534 --> 00:51:59,336
Uh, he said, "Did you
and Neil fight?"

671
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:01,706
No! No!

672
00:52:01,739 --> 00:52:04,942
My husband and I
were fine!

673
00:52:04,976 --> 00:52:06,911
Oh, my God,
what are you doing?

674
00:52:06,944 --> 00:52:08,345
What is he doing?!

675
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:09,914
What is this?

676
00:52:09,947 --> 00:52:12,817
No, why don't you
come on? Come on.

677
00:52:32,536 --> 00:52:36,641
Hey, you should
drink something.

678
00:54:28,953 --> 00:54:30,320
Neil!

679
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:33,891
Neil.

680
00:54:36,828 --> 00:54:39,931
Neil! Neil.

681
00:54:58,481 --> 00:54:59,516
Christine!

682
00:55:00,483 --> 00:55:02,053
Christine, it's Neil...

683
00:55:02,086 --> 00:55:03,621
on the phone!

684
00:55:03,654 --> 00:55:06,389
Huh? Huh?

685
00:55:10,695 --> 00:55:12,730
Neil?

686
00:55:14,632 --> 00:55:15,600
Neil?

687
00:55:16,901 --> 00:55:18,636
Honey?

688
00:55:18,669 --> 00:55:20,037
Neil, speak up, honey.

689
00:55:20,071 --> 00:55:21,504
I can't hear you.

690
00:55:22,539 --> 00:55:24,976
Hello? Hello?

691
00:55:30,547 --> 00:55:32,149
I lost the signal.

692
00:55:32,183 --> 00:55:33,918
- What did he say?
- I just...

693
00:55:33,951 --> 00:55:35,553
The reception was bad.

694
00:55:35,586 --> 00:55:37,420
He just said,
"Neil," and...

695
00:55:37,454 --> 00:55:38,990
Did he say he was okay?

696
00:55:39,023 --> 00:55:41,659
I just ran
to give you the phone.

697
00:55:43,027 --> 00:55:44,729
Oh, this is bullshit.

698
00:55:44,762 --> 00:55:46,197
Somebody's messing with us.

699
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:49,200
Do you want to call
the police?

700
00:55:49,233 --> 00:55:50,568
I know who's doing this.

701
00:55:53,604 --> 00:55:55,006
I know where he is.

702
00:56:14,792 --> 00:56:16,493
<i>A typhoon warning
is in effect...</i>

703
00:56:21,799 --> 00:56:24,201
<i>Typhoon Maicala,
a major typhoon</i>

704
00:56:24,235 --> 00:56:27,705
<i>is poised to make landfall
in five hours.</i>

705
00:56:27,738 --> 00:56:29,607
<i>Expect pounding rain,
flash flooding...</i>

706
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,175
What are you and
Nathida going to do?

707
00:56:31,208 --> 00:56:33,177
<i>...240 kilometers per hour.</i>

708
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:37,014
A storm hasn't hit
the island in 200 years.

709
00:56:38,716 --> 00:56:41,185
<i>...could sweep away
anything not nailed down.</i>

710
00:56:41,218 --> 00:56:43,187
<i>Just to put this
in context for you...</i>

711
00:56:45,289 --> 00:56:49,794
<i>...winds of
130 kilometers an hour.</i>

712
00:56:49,827 --> 00:56:52,563
<i>It is shaping up to be
the storm of the year,</i>

713
00:56:52,596 --> 00:56:53,898
<i>if not the decade,
and it's already</i>

714
00:56:53,931 --> 00:56:56,834
<i>been classified
as a super typhoon.</i>

715
00:57:06,543 --> 00:57:09,046
This is the part where I
tell you not to go in.

716
00:57:10,681 --> 00:57:12,717
This is part
where I don't listen.

717
00:57:17,288 --> 00:57:18,556
Neil!

718
00:57:24,128 --> 00:57:25,495
Neil!

719
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,533
Honey?

720
00:58:12,143 --> 00:58:14,011
Where is my husband?

721
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:44,241
Mommy.

722
00:58:44,275 --> 00:58:46,010
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, hey.

723
00:58:46,043 --> 00:58:48,779
Easy. Easy. Hey.

724
00:58:49,747 --> 00:58:51,015
How did I get here?

725
00:58:52,383 --> 00:58:54,151
You don't remember?

726
00:58:54,185 --> 00:58:55,352
Whoa!

727
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:08,699
How did I
get back here?

728
00:59:08,732 --> 00:59:12,770
Uh, as soon as you left
the car, you passed out.

729
00:59:12,803 --> 00:59:14,705
You collapsed
right in front of us.

730
00:59:14,738 --> 00:59:16,307
No, that's not possible.

731
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:17,942
You don't remember?

732
00:59:17,975 --> 00:59:19,977
I need a minute, please.

733
00:59:20,945 --> 00:59:22,913
Yeah, sure.

734
01:00:24,308 --> 01:00:25,342
Neil?

735
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:28,045
Christine?

736
01:00:30,281 --> 01:00:31,882
What's happening?

737
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:33,384
I don't...

738
01:00:33,417 --> 01:00:34,919
Where is it?

739
01:00:34,952 --> 01:00:36,287
What?

740
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,688
This?

741
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:48,265
I've heard
of those things

742
01:00:48,299 --> 01:00:52,069
healing the sick,
healing worse.

743
01:00:52,102 --> 01:00:54,238
You need to see
a doctor.

744
01:00:55,773 --> 01:00:57,107
If Neil were here...

745
01:00:57,141 --> 01:00:58,175
He's not.

746
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:01,979
It was in your head,
what you saw.

747
01:01:02,012 --> 01:01:04,148
Neil didn't kill himself
at the end of my dock.

748
01:01:04,181 --> 01:01:05,282
Then what happened?

749
01:01:07,218 --> 01:01:08,485
He, uh...

750
01:01:09,954 --> 01:01:11,789
He showed me
the video.

751
01:01:14,491 --> 01:01:16,160
Why would he do that?

752
01:01:16,193 --> 01:01:17,895
I...

753
01:01:17,928 --> 01:01:20,464
He was freaking out when I
found you in the bathroom.

754
01:01:20,497 --> 01:01:23,100
He said he didn't
know how or why,

755
01:01:23,133 --> 01:01:25,970
and he was scared
he would do it again.

756
01:01:26,003 --> 01:01:28,205
And you're
just telling me this now?!

757
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:31,442
If I saw a video of me
putting hands on my daughter,

758
01:01:31,475 --> 01:01:34,378
I'd wanna get as far away
from her as possible.

759
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,348
Look, I know
you don't trust me.

760
01:01:37,381 --> 01:01:39,783
You don't
even know me.

761
01:01:41,418 --> 01:01:42,920
But whatever is
going on with you,

762
01:01:42,953 --> 01:01:44,255
you need
to see a doctor.

763
01:01:44,288 --> 01:01:46,257
I'll do it when I
get back to the mainland.

764
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:48,993
You need
a doctor from here.

765
01:01:50,294 --> 01:01:51,996
Christine.

766
01:02:08,345 --> 01:02:10,781
Hmm.

767
01:02:12,149 --> 01:02:13,117
You are pregnant.

768
01:02:19,089 --> 01:02:20,924
That's not possible.

769
01:02:20,958 --> 01:02:23,595
Our island is good
for fertility.

770
01:02:23,628 --> 01:02:26,297
Pregnant women
are sacred here.

771
01:02:27,531 --> 01:02:29,567
Neil will be
so happy.

772
01:02:29,601 --> 01:02:31,368
Congratulations.

773
01:02:31,402 --> 01:02:32,536
That's not happening.

774
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:34,204
There's no way.

775
01:02:38,208 --> 01:02:40,144
Do you want to see?

776
01:02:55,225 --> 01:02:56,427
Oh, my God.

777
01:02:57,461 --> 01:02:58,996
That's amazing.

778
01:02:59,029 --> 01:03:01,599
Is that
the heartbeat?

779
01:03:01,633 --> 01:03:03,334
Yeah.

780
01:03:07,971 --> 01:03:12,443
Doctor,
this hallucination?

781
01:03:12,476 --> 01:03:13,645
<i>Nam Mun Prai?</i>

782
01:03:13,678 --> 01:03:16,413
No. No <i>Nam Mun Prai.</i>

783
01:03:22,252 --> 01:03:25,189
They said
it wasn't possible.

784
01:03:43,575 --> 01:03:46,210
What was that?

785
01:03:46,243 --> 01:03:48,145
He wants you to relax.
He's worried about you.

786
01:03:49,146 --> 01:03:50,147
Oh, no.
Don't you dare.

787
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:52,082
Don't you dare!

788
01:03:53,685 --> 01:03:55,386
Wait! Christine,
wait! It's ok...

789
01:04:14,037 --> 01:04:15,506
What is this?

790
01:04:16,741 --> 01:04:19,076
What's happening?

791
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:21,378
Storm.
You need to leave.

792
01:04:21,412 --> 01:04:23,347
I haven't found Neil yet.

793
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:25,449
My... My husband.

794
01:04:27,151 --> 01:04:28,452
No husband.

795
01:04:28,485 --> 01:04:30,354
Ride?

796
01:04:30,387 --> 01:04:32,624
Boat?

797
01:04:32,657 --> 01:04:36,260
I... No, I don't want
a ride or... or a boat.

798
01:04:36,293 --> 01:04:38,730
I need to find my husband,
and then I'll get a ride.

799
01:04:41,498 --> 01:04:44,501
Can I borrow your...
your phone?

800
01:04:44,535 --> 01:04:45,969
Your cell phone?

801
01:04:49,406 --> 01:04:51,275
No service.

802
01:04:51,308 --> 01:04:52,309
Of course.

803
01:05:20,805 --> 01:05:22,339
Hello?

804
01:05:24,408 --> 01:05:25,743
Hello?

805
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:30,648
Kanda?

806
01:05:48,833 --> 01:05:50,768
I'm pregnant.

807
01:05:52,804 --> 01:05:56,006
Stop.
You already know that.

808
01:05:59,476 --> 01:06:04,348
There was a time when everybody
didn't have a phone in their pocket.

809
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:08,553
You were never meant
to see what happened.

810
01:06:10,688 --> 01:06:13,323
You would have
remained unaware.

811
01:06:13,357 --> 01:06:15,492
I am brutally aware
that my husband

812
01:06:15,526 --> 01:06:17,629
forced himself on me
and then strangled me.

813
01:06:17,662 --> 01:06:19,096
Forced?

814
01:06:19,129 --> 01:06:22,099
No, encouraged...

815
01:06:22,132 --> 01:06:24,234
to create a new life.

816
01:06:24,268 --> 01:06:26,136
Being pregnant,

817
01:06:26,169 --> 01:06:28,071
there is no stronger spirit
in our faith.

818
01:06:28,105 --> 01:06:30,642
No, no, stop.
I was dead, okay?

819
01:06:30,675 --> 01:06:33,176
I saw the video.
How am I standing here?

820
01:06:34,579 --> 01:06:38,115
Not quite dead.
Not quite living.

821
01:06:38,148 --> 01:06:41,518
That necklace keeps
the scales from tipping

822
01:06:41,553 --> 01:06:42,854
in the wrong direction.

823
01:06:42,887 --> 01:06:47,157
Right now, you exist
on the spiritual plane,

824
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:49,861
where the spirits can prepare
you for the final ritual.

825
01:06:49,894 --> 01:06:51,161
I know this sounds...

826
01:06:51,194 --> 01:06:52,730
Fucking insane? Yeah.

827
01:06:57,267 --> 01:06:59,336
For hundreds of years,

828
01:06:59,369 --> 01:07:01,305
they have been
burying pregnant women

829
01:07:01,338 --> 01:07:03,708
under the post
of the town square.

830
01:07:03,741 --> 01:07:07,812
They believe that these sacrifices
get them what they want,

831
01:07:07,845 --> 01:07:09,513
to keep the island safe.

832
01:07:09,546 --> 01:07:12,817
and tonight,
they sacrifice you to stop the storm.

833
01:07:16,486 --> 01:07:18,690
Oh, fuck that.
I can't even believe

834
01:07:18,723 --> 01:07:20,324
this conversation
we're having right now.

835
01:07:20,357 --> 01:07:21,893
Are you kidding me?

836
01:07:21,926 --> 01:07:23,661
The man that I've loved
since I was 19,

837
01:07:23,695 --> 01:07:26,430
he conspired to kill me by
order of these crazy people.

838
01:07:27,932 --> 01:07:29,567
It wasn't him.

839
01:07:31,636 --> 01:07:32,737
<i>Nam Mun Prai...</i>

840
01:07:34,639 --> 01:07:36,540
corpse oil.

841
01:07:36,574 --> 01:07:39,376
It can control your mind.

842
01:07:39,409 --> 01:07:42,279
They gave it to Neil,
and he buried you in our soil.

843
01:07:47,752 --> 01:07:52,824
My son, he doesn't
have much time left,

844
01:07:52,857 --> 01:07:55,325
days, maybe weeks.

845
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:59,296
I don't believe
in their rituals.

846
01:07:59,329 --> 01:08:02,867
I don't believe an unwilling
sacrifice can stop the storm,

847
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:05,535
but I do
believe in that.

848
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:08,606
It has
the power to heal.

849
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:12,442
I can help you
if you help my son.

850
01:08:12,476 --> 01:08:14,177
Just give me
the necklace...

851
01:08:14,211 --> 01:08:18,181
No, not until you
help me find my husband

852
01:08:18,215 --> 01:08:20,852
and get us
off this fucking island.

853
01:08:20,885 --> 01:08:22,754
Then you can have
whatever you want.

854
01:09:01,626 --> 01:09:02,827
Ahh!

855
01:10:01,986 --> 01:10:03,320
No, no, no.

856
01:10:03,353 --> 01:10:06,023
You need a doctor.

857
01:10:10,494 --> 01:10:12,029
My... My son.

858
01:10:25,743 --> 01:10:27,612
Sorry.

859
01:10:30,047 --> 01:10:31,281
Okay.

860
01:10:52,003 --> 01:10:53,037
Kanda?

861
01:11:00,443 --> 01:11:01,846
Oh, no. Oh, no.

862
01:11:10,054 --> 01:11:11,622
Run!

863
01:11:11,656 --> 01:11:13,558
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

864
01:11:21,866 --> 01:11:22,900
Run.

865
01:11:35,947 --> 01:11:37,081
Hello?

866
01:11:37,114 --> 01:11:38,716
Is anybody...

867
01:11:38,749 --> 01:11:40,450
I need help.

868
01:11:40,483 --> 01:11:42,019
Shit.

869
01:11:42,053 --> 01:11:43,855
Excuse me.
Can you help me?

870
01:11:45,923 --> 01:11:47,959
Can you help me?

871
01:11:47,992 --> 01:11:49,392
Can you help?

872
01:11:51,996 --> 01:11:53,496
Excuse me.

873
01:11:53,530 --> 01:11:54,799
I need...

874
01:12:00,872 --> 01:12:01,973
Excuse me!

875
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,142
I need a phone.
Can you help me?

876
01:12:05,176 --> 01:12:06,143
No, no, no.

877
01:12:06,177 --> 01:12:07,612
Christine, oh, my God.

878
01:12:07,645 --> 01:12:09,412
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

879
01:12:09,446 --> 01:12:11,414
She's dead.

880
01:12:11,448 --> 01:12:12,583
Who?

881
01:12:12,617 --> 01:12:14,517
- Kanda.
- God.

882
01:12:14,552 --> 01:12:16,519
Come on.
Let's get you out of here.

883
01:12:16,554 --> 01:12:17,922
Are you taking me
to the ferry?

884
01:12:17,955 --> 01:12:20,157
Yeah. Come on.

885
01:12:21,491 --> 01:12:22,927
Why are you
dressed like them?

886
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,562
What, this?
This is for the festival.

887
01:12:24,595 --> 01:12:26,597
Come on. I just parked
over here. Let's go.

888
01:12:35,106 --> 01:12:37,808
<i>Right now, the typhoon
is only 1 1/2 hours away,</i>

889
01:12:37,842 --> 01:12:40,211
<i>so if you are still
within the path of the typhoon,</i>

890
01:12:40,244 --> 01:12:41,979
<i>then you need to evacuate</i>

891
01:12:42,013 --> 01:12:43,948
<i>or get yourself
to somewhere safe immediately.</i>

892
01:12:43,981 --> 01:12:46,684
<i>If your power goes out,
remain calm.</i>

893
01:12:46,717 --> 01:12:48,185
Mom, this isn't
the way to the ferry.

894
01:12:48,219 --> 01:12:49,687
It's a shortcut.

895
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:51,956
This is
against the rules.

896
01:12:51,989 --> 01:12:53,024
Nathida.

897
01:12:54,025 --> 01:12:55,458
Sorry. She plays
these games.

898
01:12:55,492 --> 01:12:56,761
Sweetie, Mama needs
to concentrate, okay?

899
01:12:56,794 --> 01:12:59,230
She wants to go
to the ferry.

900
01:12:59,263 --> 01:13:01,498
You have
to take her.

901
01:13:04,001 --> 01:13:05,069
Stop the car.

902
01:13:05,102 --> 01:13:06,671
I'm taking you
to the ferry.

903
01:13:06,704 --> 01:13:08,706
Stop lying.

904
01:13:10,507 --> 01:13:11,575
Mommy...

905
01:13:11,609 --> 01:13:12,843
she knows.

906
01:13:17,514 --> 01:13:18,816
I'm not a bad person.

907
01:13:19,817 --> 01:13:21,552
What happened
to my husband?

908
01:13:25,957 --> 01:13:28,192
You saw Kanda's son.

909
01:13:28,225 --> 01:13:31,696
That's what happens when you only
believe when it's convenient.

910
01:13:31,729 --> 01:13:33,798
This, this is
the real deal.

911
01:13:33,831 --> 01:13:35,132
The real deal?

912
01:13:35,166 --> 01:13:36,834
Ritual sacrifice?

913
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:42,606
Kanda used to believe,
and her son was fine.

914
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,108
You're bat-shit fucking crazy.
You know that?

915
01:13:44,141 --> 01:13:46,677
- I love my daughter!
- Your daughter?

916
01:13:46,711 --> 01:13:48,980
Back there was the first time
you ever saw an ultrasound.

917
01:13:51,215 --> 01:13:52,717
She's not
very good at this.

918
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:53,784
Shut up, Nathida!

919
01:13:56,988 --> 01:13:58,022
Where's your Mom?

920
01:13:59,924 --> 01:14:01,859
Stop lying.

921
01:14:03,027 --> 01:14:04,829
Where is your Mom?

922
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:08,566
Down below.

923
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:14,805
She loved this island.

924
01:14:16,007 --> 01:14:18,676
It was a sacrifice
she was happy to make.

925
01:14:18,709 --> 01:14:19,744
It's an honor.

926
01:14:20,711 --> 01:14:21,912
You killed her mother?

927
01:14:21,946 --> 01:14:23,546
I didn't do anything.

928
01:14:23,581 --> 01:14:25,082
She volunteered.

929
01:14:25,116 --> 01:14:28,219
She loved this island
and her little girl.

930
01:14:28,252 --> 01:14:29,920
I said I was sick
when I came here.

931
01:14:29,954 --> 01:14:32,156
Stage-three
pancreatic cancer.

932
01:14:32,189 --> 01:14:36,327
But here, there's
no such thing as cancer,

933
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:40,164
heart attacks, stroke,
not for those who believe.

934
01:14:40,197 --> 01:14:42,166
That life
growing inside of you

935
01:14:42,199 --> 01:14:44,635
when it wasn't possible
everywhere else...

936
01:14:45,903 --> 01:14:49,240
Yeah.
A gift this island gave you.

937
01:14:49,273 --> 01:14:52,810
This is some bastardized
fanatical backwash

938
01:14:52,843 --> 01:14:55,946
that you soulless
motherfuckers came up with

939
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:59,050
to... to feel like you
have some kind of control,

940
01:14:59,083 --> 01:15:01,018
that you have a say
in any of this!

941
01:15:01,052 --> 01:15:02,653
Where the fuck
is my husband?!

942
01:15:02,686 --> 01:15:05,322
Your husband is dead,
Christine.

943
01:15:05,356 --> 01:15:08,926
He killed himself
right in front of your eyes.

944
01:15:08,959 --> 01:15:10,661
That is this island,

945
01:15:10,694 --> 01:15:12,696
and its people
believe in something

946
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:14,932
far greater than you
or your fucking...

947
01:16:35,112 --> 01:16:37,948
Ms. Christine.

948
01:20:03,253 --> 01:20:05,022
What are we doing here?

949
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:55,072
Will you just let me go?

950
01:20:55,105 --> 01:20:58,475
For generation, it was a great honor, Ms.
Christine,

951
01:20:58,509 --> 01:21:00,411
to be marked as celebrated.

952
01:21:02,212 --> 01:21:03,414
And tonight
we celebrate you.

953
01:21:06,383 --> 01:21:10,020
We thank you
for your gift...

954
01:21:11,155 --> 01:21:12,523
for our island.

955
01:21:17,161 --> 01:21:20,097
And at all times,
people volunteer for this honor.

956
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:21,733
You should be proud.

957
01:21:21,766 --> 01:21:23,333
Volunteer?

958
01:21:23,367 --> 01:21:26,003
I didn't volunteer
for this. Fuck you!

959
01:21:26,036 --> 01:21:28,172
The drink,
you asked for.

960
01:21:28,205 --> 01:21:30,642
The necklace,
you accept.

961
01:21:30,675 --> 01:21:33,343
No. We had some shots,

962
01:21:33,377 --> 01:21:36,180
and you put some stupid
trinket around my neck.

963
01:21:36,213 --> 01:21:37,514
You did that.

964
01:21:37,548 --> 01:21:41,151
You had free will,
Ms. Christine.

965
01:21:41,185 --> 01:21:45,690
You could have left, but you chose to
stay, find your husband.

966
01:21:47,625 --> 01:21:50,093
There were boats,
Ms. Christine.

967
01:21:51,663 --> 01:21:53,565
I believe
he offered you one.

968
01:22:01,205 --> 01:22:03,575
Because free will
is so essential.

969
01:22:03,608 --> 01:22:08,011
Of course, something,
free will is an illusion.

970
01:22:08,045 --> 01:22:09,379
You saw Neil died,

971
01:22:09,413 --> 01:22:11,515
but you chose
not to leave.

972
01:22:11,548 --> 01:22:13,551
No.

973
01:22:13,585 --> 01:22:17,589
Did you just not run
right to us right here

974
01:22:17,622 --> 01:22:20,190
at our old city pillar?

975
01:22:59,463 --> 01:23:01,098
Don't fucking touch me.

976
01:23:02,266 --> 01:23:04,034
I'm not pregnant,
you motherfucker!

977
01:23:05,770 --> 01:23:09,106
Pregnant,
you very much are.

978
01:23:09,139 --> 01:23:12,509
She is one part
from your husband

979
01:23:12,543 --> 01:23:16,280
and one part
from this island.

980
01:23:16,313 --> 01:23:18,282
No, what did you
put inside me?

981
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:24,689
Island magic.

982
01:23:32,129 --> 01:23:33,598
I never had free will.

983
01:23:35,265 --> 01:23:37,200
If I have free will,
untie me.

984
01:23:40,337 --> 01:23:41,538
You don't have
to believe it...

985
01:23:41,573 --> 01:23:43,206
but we do.

986
01:23:44,308 --> 01:23:45,610
We will honor our gods.

987
01:24:21,345 --> 01:24:23,213
What are we doing here?

988
01:24:30,622 --> 01:24:32,189
It's a girl.

989
01:24:42,299 --> 01:24:44,301
You're going
to be a great Dad.

990
01:24:44,334 --> 01:24:46,436
She's gonna do
amazing things.

991
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:48,472
Both of you are
gonna do amazing things.

992
01:24:49,907 --> 01:24:51,843
But I need you
to wake up.

993
01:24:54,544 --> 01:24:56,146
I wanna stay here.

994
01:25:00,652 --> 01:25:02,419
Wake up!

995
01:25:20,605 --> 01:25:23,808
Stop! It has
to be her choice!

996
01:25:23,841 --> 01:25:24,976
Stay back!

997
01:25:25,009 --> 01:25:27,210
Stay the fuck back.

998
01:25:27,244 --> 01:25:28,713
You, where's your boat?

999
01:25:28,746 --> 01:25:30,748
You!

1000
01:25:30,782 --> 01:25:32,784
If you go, I'll die.

1001
01:25:32,817 --> 01:25:35,586
They'll all die.

1002
01:25:42,459 --> 01:25:44,494
It's not real, Nathida.
It's just a storm.

1003
01:25:44,528 --> 01:25:45,830
- It is real!
- No!

1004
01:25:45,863 --> 01:25:47,330
Come with me.

1005
01:25:47,364 --> 01:25:48,733
Save us, Christine.

1006
01:27:44,715 --> 01:27:46,751
<i>Reports are
coming in from Thailand</i>

1007
01:27:46,784 --> 01:27:48,686
<i>that super typhoon Maicala</i>

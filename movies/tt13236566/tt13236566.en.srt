2
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,403
Hey, Sally.
This is taking longer than I thought.

3
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,573
Can you jump on my schedule a bit more?

4
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:16,076
I'm working my way through
the congresswoman's Christmas list,

5
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,286
and I'm still two cashmere sweaters

6
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,663
and a Tiffany bracelet
away from the bottom.

7
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,959
I'm feeling less like a legislative aide
and more and more a personal shopper.

8
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,336
It's a compliment, Erica.

9
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,297
The congresswoman takes
her Christmas shopping very seriously.

10
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,840
That's why she only trusts it to you.

11
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,801
That's a positive spin.

12
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,597
Oh, I found that article you wanted.

13
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,308
What's a Christmas Drop?

14
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:43,019
<i>It's some sort of mission</i>
<i>out of an airbase in the Pacific</i>

15
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,731
where they parachute gifts and supplies
to remote islands at Christmas.

16
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:50,110
I am sending you a photo
of the headline page now.

17
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,241
So who's Major Eye Candy
in the Santa cap?

18
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,039
I have no idea.

19
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,457
But ever since the congresswoman

20
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,502
became head of the Base Realignment
and Closure Commission…

21
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,131
…this base has been at the top
of her naughty list.

22
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,014
Again?

23
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,224
Sorry, I lost you.
Indiana, are you guys there?

24
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,144
<i>Yeah. No, the Wi-Fi's buffering again.</i>

25
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,980
<i>Haskell, I thought we agreed
to upgrade our bandwidth.</i>

26
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:09,898
<i>We did.</i>

27
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:13,109
<i>But since you had me put the router
in the barn so you could FaceTime the vet,</i>

28
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,652
<i>the signal's too weak.</i>

29
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,613
Let's just reboot the modem.

30
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,407
No! Then we'll lose Andrew. No! Haskell!

31
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,952
And so ends our family's attempt
at Christmas caroling via web.

32
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,662
Ah, that's okay, sis.

33
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,623
Watching Mom and Dad bicker about Wi-Fi

34
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,917
reminds me of Christmas
more than you know.

35
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,587
<i>How's your Christmas over there,
Uncle Andrew?</i>

36
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,089
Well, you heard of a partridge
in a pear tree?

37
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,592
I got a seagull in a coconut palm.

38
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,553
<i>Maybe you could borrow an Air Force jet
and fly home.</i>

39
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,931
<i>It's only eight days till Christmas.</i>

40
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,891
I wish I could, kiddo,
but they need me here.

41
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,018
We got a big job helping Santa out.

42
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,063
I know. Mom told me.

43
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,483
<i>I just wish you were here for Christmas.</i>

44
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,152
Me, too, pumpkin.

45
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,445
Me, too.

46
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,708
Man, I really miss home
this time of year.

47
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,045
Look, man, I'm telling you,
nothing beats Christmas in Wisconsin.

48
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:17,048
Ice skating, ice fishing,
snowmobiling through the trees.

49
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,133
Winter there is the best season there is.

50
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,261
Yeah, Wisconsin's got all the seasons,
all right.

51
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,555
It's got winter, still winter,
more winter, mud, and then winter again.

52
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,808
Repeatin' the same joke each day

53
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,935
- doesn't make it any funnier, eh, Joker?
- Hah!

54
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,479
Look, I just thought adding in
the extra "winter"

55
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,148
- would give it more life, you know?
- 'Cause it had life?

56
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,568
The joke is Wisconsin's
got nothing on Arizona.

57
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,571
And, man, do I miss
my momma's eggnog pumpkin pie.

58
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:46,411
What about you, Sunshine?
Miss anything? Anyone?

59
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,955
I really miss Cam.

60
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,416
My '67 Camaro.

61
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,419
In my garage, gatherin' dust.

62
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:58,214
Well, we all wanna be home this time of
year, but, uh, we got the next best thing.

63
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,216
Need your signature, Captain.

64
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,220
Are you gonna be on base
for Christmas, Airman?

65
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,763
Afraid so, sir.

66
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,473
Well, we got the Drop coming up.

67
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,934
The typhoon last month
ripped the roof off of our warehouse,

68
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,562
and we lost most of our donations,
so we're still playing catch-up.

69
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,814
- We could use as much help as we can get.
- I'm signed up.

70
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,024
Well done.

71
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,276
We got a fundraiser
coming up this weekend.

72
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,029
It's gonna be lots of good music,
good people, holiday cheer.

73
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,448
And dancing. Lots and lots of dancing.

74
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,242
I'm a world-class dancer, Sunshine.

75
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,912
You know, there might be enough room
for me to show you all my moves.

76
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,665
Not gonna happen.

77
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,543
Yeah, you wouldn't wanna miss
Joker's world-class dancing.

78
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,128
It's for the best cause, so…

79
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,505
Yeah, that's just one part
of the captain's personal mission

80
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,842
to make sure that nobody in this base
misses the holiday season.

81
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,635
If we can't be home
for Christmas…

82
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,765
We're gonna bring Christmas here.

83
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,113
Come on, Sam. The committee
meeting ended at three a.m., okay?

84
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,407
The congresswoman was tired and misspoke.

85
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,743
How about you quote someone else
for your article,

86
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:14,624
and maybe I can find an invite for you
for the French embassy's New Year's party?

87
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,545
Yes. With a plus one. Great.

88
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,131
You're magic.

89
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,674
I think this legislative-aide thing

90
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,177
may put your personal shopping career
on the back burner.

91
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,055
And that's why you're a shoo-in
to be the next chief of staff.

92
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,641
Last I checked, we already have one.

93
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:35,103
Not for long. I hear that lobbying group
just upped Sheila's offer.

94
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,146
- Seriously?
- Mm-hm.

95
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:38,981
…cowboys, cowboys…

96
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,233
No. There's…

97
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:43,444
…others way ahead of me
in line for that, like Matt.

98
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,904
How do I compete with a guy

99
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,032
that can pull off a holiday tie
and a matching pocket square?

100
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:52,829
Bradford's Bat-Signal.

101
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,081
- It's all emojis. She's in trouble.
- Mm.

102
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,707
I got this.

103
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,216
Well, it's…
it's quite a lot of detail to take in.

104
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:08,344
Excuse me, congresswoman.
You're wanted on an urgent matter.

105
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,763
- National security.
- Mm.

106
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,098
- Excuse us.
- Mm.

107
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,934
Ah, that was perfect timing.

108
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:19,522
Remind me not to have discussions
with snow sculpture enthusiasts again.

109
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,982
I'll add it to the list, ma'am.

110
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,443
Okay. You have 40 minutes

111
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,154
before your meeting with General Mason
about the closure proposals.

112
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,530
- That's today?
- Mm-hm.

113
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,491
Where are you with the research
on that air base in the Pacific?

114
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,286
Andersen is the base.
I'm pulling together some info.

115
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,207
"Operation Christmas Drop."

116
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,959
They've been using
our military cargo planes

117
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:43,379
to drop gifts and supplies
to remote islands at Christmas.

118
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,424
If we're looking to close down bases,
this one's flashing red and green.

119
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,676
They're calling it
a low altitude training exercise.

120
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,845
That just happens
to be dropping Christmas presents.

121
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,972
Yes, but I'm sure
there's more to it than that.

122
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,975
Well, then, find out.
I'm gonna send you over there.

123
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,936
You can assess their operations,
suggest cuts,

124
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,481
or, better yet,
make a case for base closure.

125
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,398
You're sending me?

126
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,152
I need your investigative prowess
to turn over every stone on that island.

127
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,072
You know, January in the tropics
doesn't sound so bad.

128
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:14,827
Says here this Drop thing is in a week.
You need to be there before it happens.

129
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,622
Boots on the ground, Miller.

130
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,000
Kind of had plans for Christmas.

131
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,378
Hey, Dad.

132
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,299
I guess, by the look on your face,
you got my message.

133
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,801
<i>Honey, what assignment</i>
<i>is so important</i>

134
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,638
you have to cancel Christmas
with your family this time?

135
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,432
Look, I know you're disappointed,
but I can't get out of it.

136
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:40,561
Carol and I were really
looking forward to seeing you this year.

137
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,479
<i>I know, Dad.</i>

138
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,898
But it's a chief of staff job opening,

139
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,150
and this might be
a real game-changer for me.

140
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,905
Are you sure
that's really the reason, sweetheart?

141
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,198
<i>What else would it be?</i>

142
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,827
You haven't been here for Christmas
since your mom passed away, Eri.

143
00:08:56,911 --> 00:09:00,248
If you could just give Carol a chance,
I think you two could be friends.

144
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,041
It's not Carol, Dad.

145
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,962
Look, maybe there's a way that I can…

146
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,631
Come for your birthday, maybe.

147
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,591
<i>Another "maybe."</i>

148
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,511
Well, that's the best I got, Dad.

149
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,181
<i>Be safe. I love you.</i>

150
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,476
Okay. I love you.

151
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,111
I know, Mom.

152
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,196
I'm trying.

153
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,205
- Permission to enter, sir?
- Enter.

154
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,671
At ease, Andrew.

155
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,382
- You asked to see me, sir?
- I did.

156
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:54,927
I got off the phone with the head of
the Armed Services Committee this morning.

157
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,805
Word is, we're on the short list
for realignment or closure.

158
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:58,723
Seriously, sir?

159
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,433
They make a final decision in a few weeks,

160
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,643
but a friend on the Hill got a message
to me saying

161
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,729
we've got a target on our backs.

162
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,982
But, sir, we're the most strategically
important location in the South Pacific.

163
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,901
Maybe, but this didn't help.

164
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,447
For some reason,
this has grabbed Washington's attention,

165
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,990
and now we're in their crosshairs.

166
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,367
- And I need you to get us out of it.
- Me, sir?

167
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:22,955
There's a congressional aide flying in
from DC to evaluate base operations.

168
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,541
I need someone to show 'em around,
put our best foot forward.

169
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,793
But, sir, I'm a cargo pilot.

170
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,046
You've also got
mad people skills, Captain.

171
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,090
And there isn't anyone on this base
I would trust more to pull this off.

172
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,802
Sir, I really think you'd be better off
with one of the base PAOs.

173
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:37,720
You know, the...

174
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,265
If I put a Public Affairs Officer on this,
it would make it official, Andrew.

175
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,017
We're not supposed
to know about this yet.

176
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,061
We got nothin' to hide.

177
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,814
Exactly, which is why I want you
to make sure this bean-counter sees

178
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,192
we are 100% mission-focused on this base.

179
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,236
The flight from DC lands
at 0900 tomorrow.

180
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:56,989
That is all.

181
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,241
Understood, sir.

182
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:20,930
Hi!

183
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,516
Those look dangerous.

184
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,185
Unexploded ordnance?

185
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,688
- Used to be.
- Uh-huh.

186
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,232
Now we just use it
to keep tourists off our break.

187
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,236
Aren't you a little overdressed
for the beach?

188
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,822
Aren't you a little underdressed
for an officer?

189
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,533
Off duty…

190
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,159
For eight more minutes.

191
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:47,123
If you're lost,
the resort is back that way two clicks.

192
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:51,460
I'm not lost. Just wanna stretch my legs.
It was a pretty long flight.

193
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,672
- Long flight?
- Yeah, 36 hours from DC.

194
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,634
Washington?

195
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,263
Washington, DC.

196
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,433
I think I'm your ride.

197
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,560
Huh.

198
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,899
Seriously, General Hatcher said
your flight lands at 0900.

199
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:19,155
I switched planes in Pearl
and shaved two hours off of my trip.

200
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,116
In my line of work,
I look for ways to improve efficiency.

201
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,619
And what brainiac
steered you down to the beach?

202
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,538
Oh, the same one
that tried your cell five times

203
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,248
while you were out playing in the water.

204
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,377
Oh.

205
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,963
So it was one of the smart brainiacs.

206
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,090
- Is this military issue?
- Nope.

207
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,677
It's my Jeep. I wouldn't use
a military-issue vehicle for personal use.

208
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,804
By the way, the name's Andrew.

209
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,056
Oh, I know. I recognize you.

210
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,143
From that <i>Stars and Stripes</i> article

211
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,937
about cargo pilots providing
just-in-time combat support?

212
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:56,358
No, from the ukulele Santa photo
in the newspaper.

213
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,028
No offense, ma'am, but you don't know
the first thing about me.

214
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,530
Captain Andrew Jantz,

215
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:06,619
interim commander on G-Series orders
for the 734th Air Mobility Squadron.

216
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,788
You've been a cargo pilot for nine years.

217
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,166
You graduated UCLA ROTC with high honors

218
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:15,044
and a reprimand for a prank
involving the colonel's car…

219
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,004
And a possum.

220
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,716
Well, maybe I know a little bit
about you, too.

221
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,301
- Really?
- Yeah.

222
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,805
By that accent,
I'd say you hail from Philadelphia.

223
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:29,350
That key chain on your tote bag says
you went to Georgetown.

224
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,561
And by the way you like to call the shots,
you headed your college sorority.

225
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,438
Impressive.

226
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,733
Wildly inaccurate.

227
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,111
The accent is from Boston,
but I went to UPenn

228
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,989
and lost most of it
in a Delaware Valley dialect.

229
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:47,284
And the key chain on my tote
is from Georgetown, but it was a gift

230
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:51,163
from the Georgetown School
of Foreign Service conference in Qatar.

231
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,124
<i>Hey, Claws.</i>
<i>You, uh, got that bean-counter yet?</i>

232
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,751
"Claus"?

233
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,840
Around here, I'm not Andrew.
I'm Claws. C-L-A-W-S.

234
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,425
It's an aircrew tradition
to address each other with call signs.

235
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,178
I would have thought "Claus" as in Santa
would have made more sense.

236
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,722
One picture in a Santa hat
isn't enough to earn a call sign.

237
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:14,603
Okay, Claws, why did your general
pick you to fly my Jeep this week?

238
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,605
Must be his great sense of humor.

239
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,692
And your boss sending you here
a week before Christmas?

240
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,278
Duty calls.

241
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,321
You won't find any inefficiencies.

242
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,700
I'd like to see things for myself,
just the same.

243
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,328
Now I understand.

244
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,330
Understand what?

245
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,915
Why your boss sent you here.

246
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,502
So you wouldn't spoil
the office Christmas party.

247
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,546
Just drive.

248
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:04,153
You'll be staying here.
Base housing for short-term guests.

249
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,573
You've been up all night.
How about you get some shut-eye?

250
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:11,201
- I'll pick you up later this afternoon.
- Oh, no. We're starting in 30 minutes.

251
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,913
That didn't sound
like a question.

252
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,542
Yeah, well, I need to change my shoes
and answer e-mails.

253
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,960
And then I wanna tour the base.

254
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,338
I need to interview staff,
review purchase orders.

255
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,548
Basic fact-finding mission.

256
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,261
What do you intend to find?

257
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,349
Probably more
than you feel comfortable sharing.

258
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,070
Sorry it's not the Ritz.

259
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,489
But if you see a gecko,
remember they're good luck.

260
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,199
Don't worry.
When you work on Capitol Hill,

261
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,118
you're used to all sorts of odd creatures.

262
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,955
Copy that. See you in 30.

263
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,333
Oh, and, Captain,
can you get me a map of the island,

264
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,044
a command org chart,
and a base acquisition forecast?

265
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,215
Would you also like turndown service
and mints on your pillow, too, ma'am?

266
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:11,261
The general told me you were here
to assist me in any way that I needed.

267
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:16,183
Map, org chart,
and acquisition forecast. Roger that.

268
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,267
Perfect.

269
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,480
You're gonna fit in great around here.
Clearly, you like giving orders.

270
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,440
See you in a half.

271
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,830
The bean-counter has landed.

272
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:43,168
And she is the most high-maintenance,
condescending pencil pusher I've ever met.

273
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,503
- She, sir?
- Is she single?

274
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,797
- Is she gonna be trouble?
- Not if I can help it.

275
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,924
I'm just going to give her the grand tour,

276
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,886
let the island work its magic, and
she will be out of our hair in no time.

277
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,855
Oh!

278
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:08,360
Luck? Why don't you go spread your luck
outside or something, hm?

279
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,154
Come on.

280
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,865
Come on.

281
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,659
Shoo, shoo. Come on.

282
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,044
No? Okay.

283
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,047
It's freakin' me out.

284
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,674
Okay.

285
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,933
Hey.

286
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,270
<i>Aloha! </i>
<i>How's paradise treating you?</i>

287
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,980
It's not alohahere, Sal.

288
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,274
That is Hawaii. Here, they say <i>hafa adai.</i>

289
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,026
And, as for paradise,

290
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,322
there is a gecko that is giving me
the evil eye as we speak.

291
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,239
What's up?

292
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,534
The boss wanted me to check in,
make sure you got there in one piece.

293
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,078
Is it hot? It looks hot.

294
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,788
<i>It is so hot.</i>

295
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,749
<i>I started into it.
They assigned me a handler.</i>

296
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:07,377
He's got a huge ego,
but nothing I can't handle.

297
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,921
<i>Is he a pilot?</i>

298
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,006
Why? 'Cause pilots have big egos?

299
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,967
<i>But that's okay,
because, you know, they're pilots.</i>

300
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:15,844
Good thing the door was open.

301
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,430
I don't think my huge ego
would fit through the window.

302
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,974
<i>Uh… gotta go!</i> Hafa adai.

303
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:25,020
- Don't people knock around here?
- The door was open.

304
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,106
Yeah, I'm trying to get rid of this gecko.

305
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,733
Don't wanna do that.
I told you, they're lucky…

306
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,445
And the best insect repellent
you're gonna find.

307
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,155
Uhhh…

308
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,659
All right. Let's get started.

309
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,455
Your air conditioner is broken.

310
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,667
Let's go.

311
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,881
This base is home to the 36th
Wing in the 734th Air Mobility Squadron.

312
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,260
Bombers and heavy transport as well
as fighter groups like these F-15s here

313
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,678
rotate through on a regular basis.

314
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,346
We have operations all around the island.

315
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,266
See, despite the impression that
the article gave, there is no slack here.

316
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,434
Everybody is busy with very serious work.

317
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,400
Are those Christmas ornaments?

318
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,277
Ornaments and gifts
for our local school kids.

319
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,653
Part of our community outreach.

320
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,823
We'll head to Acquisitions,
and then we'll go to the tower. Come on.

321
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,910
Okay. I am going to skim this one.

322
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,246
Hm…

323
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,040
Um… This one.

324
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,667
Let's see.

325
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,380
You know, I've got all the info
on a portable hard drive.

326
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,048
This one…

327
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,967
Actually, no, the binders work fine.

328
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,263
Yep. This one.

329
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:54,193
The elevator's being serviced,
but you can leave your stuff

330
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,404
at the base of the stairs,
or I'm happy to carry it up for you.

331
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,532
I'm good. Thanks.

332
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,960
This is the tallest tower
in all the Pacific Air Forces.

333
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,795
Sixteen stories.

334
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,798
Originally built in the '60s.

335
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,596
Hey, guys, we have a visitor.

336
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,725
Sergeant, finish that doughnut.

337
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,853
See? Nothing goes to waste here.

338
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,689
- Quite a view.
- It is, ma'am.

339
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:39,988
Yeah, I, uh… want to come up
and see it at night, though.

340
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,158
I was leafing
through your purchase orders,

341
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:47,162
and I noticed an order
for red and green… landing lights.

342
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,916
Lights can be handy
if you wanna land a plane at night.

343
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,753
- Got an answer for everything.
- 'Cause I'm efficient.

344
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,505
Up next, Detachment Two,

345
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,924
the 21st Space Operations Squadron.

346
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,384
Do we have to walk?

347
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,303
You know,
when you visit our island,

348
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:07,099
it's considered bad luck
not to visit all five of our beaches.

349
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,768
That line work with all the girls?

350
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,396
Look, Captain,
I appreciate the guided tour,

351
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,398
but I'd like to stay focused
on base resources.

352
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,957
Like I said, we got operations
all over the island.

353
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,007
What's at Tarague Beach?

354
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,342
Oh, it's just a… big swamp.

355
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:46,722
Lot of military assets
heading toward a… big swamp.

356
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,890
Yes, they must be doing
some sort of survival training.

357
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,477
Next up, the largest outdoor market
on the island.

358
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,149
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

359
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,402
How much is this?

360
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,696
You don't like this one? Okay.

361
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,615
Thank you! Hi. How are you? Hey!

362
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,705
- Hi, Andrew.
- Hi, Noelia. Hey, guys.

363
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,749
This is all really nice, but, uh…

364
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,460
I came here to observe and report,

365
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:19,838
not, uh, work on my tan
and taste the local fare, okay?

366
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,302
<i>- Hafa adai,</i> Sue.
- Hey, Andrew.

367
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,887
- How you doin'?
- Good. How are you?

368
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,389
- I'm good. Could I grab two, please?
- Sure.

369
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,225
Oh, by the way,
our church's canned food drive was huge.

370
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,394
We've got five crates of food
for the Drop.

371
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,937
- That's awesome!
- Yeah!

372
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,981
- I'll see you on packing day.
- Yeah.

373
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:42,444
Coconut Christmas. This Saturday.
What's that about?

374
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,571
Probably just some local thing.

375
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,241
- Straw.
- See you Saturday night, Andrew.

376
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:54,456
Yeah… How do you like that?
Christmas colors.

377
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,833
It's hard to remember it's Christmas
when it's this hot.

378
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:00,045
Actually, will you excuse me
for a second? Be right back.

379
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,713
Right?

380
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,259
Hey, Mr. Mayor. Sorry to interrupt.

381
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,803
How are you doin', sir?

382
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:11,306
Let me guess, Cap'n.
You want me to donate another generator?

383
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,600
The typhoon kicked the crap
out of the atolls.

384
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,602
Generators are their source of power.

385
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,688
We have no way of communicating with them
if they can't use their ham radios.

386
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,607
I get it. I feel for them.

387
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,235
But I'm not in the business
of giving away generators for free.

388
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,153
They cost far too much.

389
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,155
If you don't mind,
I'm in the middle of something.

390
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,285
Who was that?

391
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,538
That is Mayor Sampson.

392
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,957
He's probably one of the richest men
on the island.

393
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,584
And the one with the least amount
of Christmas spirit.

394
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,381
Someone should invite him to the Coconut
Christmas on Saturday and remind him.

395
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,091
That's actually a good idea.

396
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:49,136
I'll talk to some of the locals about it
who are putting on this local event.

397
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,479
It's getting late here.
Is this even a road?

398
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,897
Quick detour…

399
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:04,109
To the most sensational turquoise beach
you'll ever set your eyes on.

400
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,278
Maybe run down the clock
till I head home?

401
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:10,031
I am offended you even think
I would stoop so low.

402
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,871
You know what, Captain?

403
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,498
Maybe you're right.

404
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,125
- I am?
- Eh…

405
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,502
Can't beat 'em, join 'em.

406
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,504
Great!

407
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,423
To the beach!

408
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:28,884
To the beach.

409
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,810
Nice, huh?

410
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:42,731
- I told you it's beautiful.
- Beautiful? Oh, it's amazing.

411
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,570
Wow.

412
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,783
Aaah!

413
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,911
Nothin' beats this view.

414
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:00,081
Man, I have to send a selfie to my dad.

415
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,084
- Oh...
- Left your phone in the Jeep?

416
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,127
- I did.
- I can go get it.

417
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,295
I got it. I got it.

418
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,214
I got it.

419
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,187
Hey!

420
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,815
Enjoy the view.

421
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:33,823
Okay.

422
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,248
Shut up!

423
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,501
Figured you'd come back through the trees.

424
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,545
- She left your Jeep for you.
- Where is she?

425
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,171
Where isn't she?

426
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:52,592
Air Ops, Supply, Wing HQ, Com Squadron.

427
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:56,096
Oh, man! This assignment's gonna be harder
than I thought.

428
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,989
- Cap'n.
- Where's your shadow, Captain?

429
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,450
She went rogue, but it's under control.

430
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,203
Claws to Andersen Tower.
You guys got eyes on Blitzen?

431
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,163
<i>Claws, Andersen Tower.</i>

432
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,833
<i>Blitzen last seen outside Air Mobility,
Hangar Three.</i>

433
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,209
Oh, no.

434
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,546
Blitzen?

435
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,340
Really, Captain?

436
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,426
I pitched for "Grinch,"
but nobody went for it.

437
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,762
Hi. We were just, uh, talkin' about you.
How'd you find me?

438
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,390
Left my phone in your Jeep
and tracked you here.

439
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,643
Figured the first place you'd go
is the last place you'd want me to see.

440
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,812
Damn, she's good.

441
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:49,649
So, Air Force base
or Claws' little village?

442
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,193
- I can explain.
- Good.

443
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,654
You can start by explaining
what is going on at Tarague Beach.

444
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,742
I drove by there,
and instead of finding survival training,

445
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,536
I found Christmas decorations
and party supplies.

446
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,497
Time to lay your Christmas cards
on the table, Captain.

447
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:15,008
Okay, that stuff you saw at the beach
is for Saturday night.

448
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,844
And all of this
is for Operation Christmas Drop.

449
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,013
Yeah, I know.
It's one of the reasons I'm here.

450
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:23,099
You might know it's a tradition
that goes back almost 70 years.

451
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:27,520
Last year, we delivered medicine, food,
toys, and gifts

452
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,106
to almost 30,000 people,
56 different islands.

453
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,733
And we plan to do more this year.

454
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,152
I'm sure it's a good cause,
but not on the taxpayers' dime.

455
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,863
That's just it.
Taxpayers don't pay a cent!

456
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,824
- I find that hard to believe.
- It's funded entirely by donation.

457
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,993
Almost all of it from people
here on the island.

458
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:45,664
Individuals, businesses, church groups
all year long are donating.

459
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,208
Clothes, food, medicine, supplies,

460
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,876
fishing nets, everything you see here.

461
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,128
But what about the military personnel
that it takes?

462
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:55,256
Everyone is working on their off hours.
That's how much it means to them.

463
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,593
Okay. What about the fuel?
The wear and tear on the aircraft?

464
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:03,014
The Drop is probably <i>the </i>best
low-altitude training these crews get.

465
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,974
We'd be flying these planes
to train anyways.

466
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:08,103
At least, with the Drop,
we're doing something good while we fly.

467
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,523
Plus, we get to work with our allies.
The Japanese, the Australians.

468
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,819
Most importantly, it's Christmas.

469
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,698
A lot of the people we help live on some
of the most remote islands in the world.

470
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,200
If it wasn't for us and the work we do,
they'd be on their own.

471
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,493
I'm not the Grinch.

472
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,370
I get it.

473
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:29,833
It's a good cause. It's good training.
I see the benefits.

474
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,376
But I have an assignment,

475
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,380
and, cost aside, I don't see how
this helps the functioning of the base.

476
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:44,305
For a lot of the enlisted kids here, this
is their first Christmas away from home.

477
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:48,935
With the Drop, they feel like they're
doing something important. Helping people.

478
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,687
I'll be sure to mention it all
in my report.

479
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,147
Yeah, I bet.

480
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,315
What is that supposed to mean?

481
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,068
I think you had your mind made up
before you stepped off the plane.

482
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,822
Look, Captain, I'm not gonna tell
the congresswoman to take it easy

483
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,782
because you have a big heart
and a nice smile.

484
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,661
So you admit I have a nice smile?

485
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:10,123
Look, we're a family here.

486
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,584
And what you say about us could lead
to the base closing.

487
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,669
- We've heard the rumors.
- I don't make the decision.

488
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:15,670
I just write a report.

489
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,630
A report you've been told
needs to be damning

490
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,008
to get to a result
some congresswoman needs to fill a quota.

491
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,176
That's not true.

492
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:26,055
Give me 24 hours to show you
what we do here, starting with the Drop.

493
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,141
Then write whatever you want
in your report.

494
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,268
Captain, this isn't a negotiation.

495
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,228
Everything's a negotiation, Erica.

496
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,814
I need you to see what we do here.

497
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,484
Then at least you'll be writing the truth.

498
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,070
- Packing tape.
- Packing tape…

499
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,072
Well, hold onto that tape.

500
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,218
- Hi, I'm...
- Erica.

501
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,177
- Yeah.
- Yes, of course.

502
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,929
- I'm Sandra. Come on in.
- Thanks.

503
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:10,475
So kind of you to invite me,
and totally unnecessary.

504
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,018
You're far from home at Christmas.

505
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,103
The least we could do is
give you a home-cooked meal.

506
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,105
Thank you. I like your place.

507
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,359
Thanks. When we first moved in,
it was a little cinder-block chic.

508
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,444
Built to withstand typhoons
and good taste.

509
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:24,155
But I've managed to nudge it
in the right direction.

510
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,073
Are you a decorator?

511
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,326
No, actually, I'm the OSS Commander.

512
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:29,869
That would make you...

513
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,121
Lieutenant Colonel Blaine,
your 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.

514
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,164
- Yeah.
- Okay!

515
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,875
I had no idea
that you and the general were married.

516
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,085
Dinner's ready!

517
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,254
Well, tonight, he is not the general.
He's the chef.

518
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:42,549
And he will not tolerate it if we eat
cold food, so please take a seat.

519
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,217
Okay. Wow!

520
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,594
This is wonderful.

521
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,805
Yeah.
Not only a superb Wing Commander

522
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:52,100
but also a true epicurean
when it comes to holiday meals.

523
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,977
I'd ask you to carve, Ms. Miller,

524
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,729
but I'm hoping to avoid
you making any unnecessary cuts.

525
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,315
- Hatch!
- It's okay, ma'am.

526
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:03,361
I'm just here to write a report, General.
My boss is the one making the decisions.

527
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:06,447
And has Captain Jantz been effectively
facilitating your report?

528
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,200
Yes, very effective
in steering me in the wrong direction.

529
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,411
But that'll only help me
find the right one.

530
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:13,997
Cheers.

531
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,249
Cheers.

532
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,132
Thank you.

533
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,301
Sandra, that was great.

534
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,261
Are you sure I can't give you a ride?

535
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,263
Oh, it's such a beautiful night
for a walk.

536
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:33,975
And the sooner I get back to my room,
the sooner I have to get back to work.

537
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,185
- Your report.
- My report.

538
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:39,606
A lot of people's livelihoods are resting
on your shoulders right now, Erica.

539
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,901
I'm painfully aware of that, ma'am, but,
as I said, I don't make the decisions.

540
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,570
Well, yeah, you do. Don't fool yourself.

541
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:49,198
Everything that you decide to write
in that report will directly impact

542
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,950
the lives of everyone on this base.

543
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,995
While you're here,
you need to meet all these people.

544
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,748
You need to see all the great work
that they're doing.

545
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,626
Lieutenant Colonel,
you know as well as I do

546
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,921
that, sometimes, hard decisions
have to be made for the greater good.

547
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,673
As painful as they might be.
I tried to tell Andrew that.

548
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,470
Just so you know…
I mean, Andrew is impossible.

549
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,765
But he's the most honorable guy
you'll ever meet.

550
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:16,351
- Oh, really?
- He's a good person to show you around.

551
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,811
And I really hope
that you see everything.

552
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,565
Thank you. Well, have a good night.

553
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,524
Good night, Erica.

554
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,958
See? We got three inches today.

555
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,336
They're predicting it'll be
the whitest Christmas in 30 years.

556
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:46,881
- Ah, makes me feel so Christmassy.
<i>- Oh, I wish I was there.</i>

557
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,841
Are you crazy? You're in paradise.

558
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,970
<i>You sound like the pilot
they assigned to show me around here.</i>

559
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,180
<i>He's trying to get me to see
how beautiful the island is</i>

560
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,516
instead of concentrating on the base.

561
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,394
<i>Erica, promise me
you will try to have some fun.</i>

562
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,895
<i>You're on a tropical island.</i>

563
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:02,772
<i>Progress?</i>

564
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,026
Yes, I, am… actually…

565
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:11,781
Currently going through thousands of pages
of expenditure reports right now, ma'am.

566
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,449
<i>Well, forget about that.</i>

567
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:17,161
<i>Matt and his group are working
on the base's file plan here.</i>

568
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:20,540
<i>It's all available on the DOD server.
I'm surprised you didn't know about that.</i>

569
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,501
This is all they offered up.

570
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,004
<i>I need you on your A game, Erica.</i>

571
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,338
<i>I'm being pushed to come up</i>

572
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,425
<i>with comprehensive shutter arguments
for three bases.</i>

573
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,594
Two of them are easy.
One of them is in my district.

574
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,139
I need a replacement,
and that's going to be your base

575
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:39,058
with its yearly Christmas present toss.

576
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,894
<i>Actually, they're not dropping presents.</i>

577
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,397
<i>It's a remarkable humanitarian mission</i>

578
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,566
<i>that's helping
tens of thousands of people.</i>

579
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,485
I'm sorry to sound harsh here,
but using military equipment

580
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,613
to drop Christmas presents in the middle
of nowhere can't be justified.

581
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,949
That's just it.
That's not what's happening here, ma'am.

582
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,661
<i>As far as I'm concerned,
that's the headline of your report.</i>

583
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,706
<i>Don't drink their Kool-Aid, Erica.</i>

584
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,567
All right, I'm here.

585
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,235
As promised.

586
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,945
Great. Ready in a sec.

587
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:35,823
Oh.

588
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,409
Love what you've done with the place.

589
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,453
Don't knock it.

590
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:45,875
Cardboard is surprisingly strong
and unexpectedly stylish.

591
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,753
Yeah, unexpectedly.

592
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:53,424
These boxes will all be gone
in a couple of days.

593
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,345
- What are you doing here?
- What?

594
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,430
I can't imagine
other captains live like this.

595
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,099
I like it here.

596
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,768
I get to sort stuff on my free time.

597
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,353
I don't need much furniture.

598
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,189
Anyway, you ready for our trip?

599
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:09,524
Sure.

600
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,860
What'd you have in mind?

601
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,572
I thought you said
we were running an errand!

602
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,490
We are.

603
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:20,159
Could've sworn
you didn't used the word "helicopter."

604
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,744
'Cause I knew you'd never go.

605
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,872
Man, what a day for flyin'.

606
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,667
Or crashing into the sea, maybe.

607
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,168
I wouldn't worry about that.

608
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,547
We have the Navy to thank
for letting us hitch a ride.

609
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,590
They have all the rotary assets
around here,

610
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,134
so we gotta be extra nice to them.

611
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:39,178
Go Navy! Beat Army!

612
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,646
It's so awesome up here!

613
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:52,567
Sometimes, I look down and realize
I have the best job in the world.

614
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:56,070
You know, it's hard to believe
that someone like you is a pilot.

615
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,114
Yeah? What should
someone like me do for a living?

616
00:35:58,906 --> 00:35:59,866
Sales of some sort?

617
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,123
- What's happening?
- We're landin'.

618
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,666
Just droppin' in to say hi.

619
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,316
Over here.

620
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:46,412
A tropical island
in the middle of nowhere.

621
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:51,918
It must be paradise living here.
No voicemail. No traffic.

622
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,962
No doctors. No stores. No help.

623
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,007
Out here, if you can't build it
or grow it yourself, you do without.

624
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,091
<i>Feliz Navidad!</i>

625
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,427
<i>- Feliz Navidad!</i>
<i>- Feliz Navidad!</i>

626
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,096
{\an8}<i>- Feliz Navidad.</i>
<i>- Feliz Navidad.</i>

627
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,892
- And you hope for the best.
- Yeah, and there's that.

628
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,393
This island's one of the lucky ones.

629
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,480
Some of the other islands
only see a supply ship once a year.

630
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,483
How is it you know somebody
all the way out here?

631
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,401
John-Michael was stationed
at the base.

632
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,320
He's one of the best loadmasters
I ever had.

633
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,655
Used to be?

634
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,198
<i>Buenas</i> and <i>hafa adai,</i> cuz.

635
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,407
<i>Hafa adai, che'lu.</i>

636
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:26,661
Came back to help my family.
They needed a hand. I'm John-Michael.

637
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,955
Hi, Erica Miller.
Sorry, I didn't mean to be nosy.

638
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:32,083
No, if you're hanging with him, I think
someone deserves to cut you some slack.

639
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,709
Wow! Shots fired!

640
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:37,046
Thank you. Finally!
Someone who understands.

641
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,174
Erica's visiting from DC.
I'm showing her around the islands.

642
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,594
Oh, well, hope you like coconuts.
We've got a lot of coconuts.

643
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,013
Come on. Let's go.

644
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,106
- They're beautiful.
- Thank you.

645
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,109
Oh! Oh, I loved it.

646
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,951
- Please help with that…
- Oh, hello, little one!

647
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:10,246
- Hi!
- Ha-hey! Good to see you.

648
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,289
- You too!
- Hey, guys!

649
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,542
Welcome to our village.

650
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,169
Thank you.

651
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,171
It's beautiful.

652
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,716
- Love it.
- Thank you.

653
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,970
That's my niece, Ilana.

654
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,346
She's a smart one.

655
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,515
- Best reader in grade two.
- Right on.

656
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:32,184
- You have a grade school here?
- Satellite internet school.

657
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,770
But since power got knocked out
in the typhoon,

658
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,105
school's been out of commission.

659
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:39,650
Hopefully, that's just temporary.
We need to find another generator.

660
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,235
Sampson said no again?

661
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,947
Yeah. I'll make sure we have schoolbooks
and mosquito nets for the next drop.

662
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,867
- Thanks, bro.
- You provide schoolbooks?

663
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,412
- Yeah, whatever's needed.
- Everything gets used. Boxes, strappings.

664
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,540
Even the parachutes are valuable.
They get turned into sails for the canoes.

665
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:55,458
Wow!

666
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,835
You should see the kids swarm
when they hear the planes.

667
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,879
It's like Santa himself
dropping off presents.

668
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,051
Hey, Ilana, I have an idea.

669
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:09,347
How would you and your friends

670
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,349
like some markers to draw with?

671
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,018
Can I see that?

672
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,644
- Markers?
- Yeah.

673
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,438
Hairbrush.

674
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,106
- That's right.
- We don't have one.

675
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,192
I have a mirror compact in here.

676
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:24,320
Oh, and here's some scrunchies.

677
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:27,490
- There's a sweater, if you ever get cold.
- Oh, that's nice!

678
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,203
Actually, why don't you just…

679
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,414
Take the bag?
You can put your seashells in it.

680
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,625
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

681
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,504
This is for you. For Christmas.

682
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:45,049
Wow!

683
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,010
That's awesome.

684
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,596
Thank you.

685
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,056
Merry Christmas!

686
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,682
I haven't tried that…

687
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,065
Now you know how I feel
every time I come here.

688
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,778
All that's missing
is some Christmas music.

689
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:09,365
Ilana, do you know anybody
that knows any Christmas carols?

690
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,665
Oh, I don't know if now's the time.

691
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,584
Play, Uncle. Please!

692
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,421
Christmas carols on a ukulele?
This should be good.

693
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,630
Any requests?

694
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,007
Anything to make me forget

695
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:30,010
I'm half a world away from home
at Christmas.

696
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,806
Let's see.

697
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,289
That's good!

698
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,643
Whoo! Yeah! Whoo!

699
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,687
Yeah! Yeah!

700
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,833
It's really nice
that all of you try and help them.

701
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,629
We're just doin' the best we can
with what we have.

702
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,799
No. You made them happier
in a few minutes

703
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:53,260
than I've done all year
in the Capitol Building.

704
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,056
And you did it all with a ukulele.

705
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:02,186
Come on, it's time to show you
what we've been up to at Tarague Beach.

706
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:09,276
So, what we're gonna do is
hook up 12 volts, uh, charger here.

707
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,029
And so you can take the plus,
and I'll take the minus.

708
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:12,947
Okay.

709
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,241
Be sure it's all cleared.

710
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,369
All right, boys,
just spread 'em out a little bit.

711
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,913
I like that. I like that. Oh, shoot!

712
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,336
Yeah, that's good. Put that one up.

713
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:28,837
Here you go.

714
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,466
<i>- Hafa adai.</i>
<i>- Hafa adai,</i> ma'am.

715
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,802
- Andrew. Erica.
- Hey. <i>Hafa adai,</i> Sandra.

716
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,847
So, every year, we put on
this Coconut Christmas fundraiser

717
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,683
so we can raise money for the Drop.

718
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,644
It stretches resources,
but it's worth it in the end.

719
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,355
Don't tell me
this doesn't cost anything to put on.

720
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:49,233
The wood is offcuts
from a local construction company.

721
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,360
Everybody here brought
whatever lights they can spare.

722
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:54,488
- Uh-huh.
- Food is supplied by a local church group.

723
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,365
Brother Bruce and Sunshine over there
set it up

724
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,617
so that we are 100% solar-powered.

725
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,202
Brother Bruce?

726
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,997
Bruce Best. He's a legend here.

727
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,499
He's our link
between all the islands and atolls.

728
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,669
He's been doing the Drop
for the last 40 years.

729
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,213
That's nice!

730
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,756
- Whoa!
- Yeah! That's great.

731
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,765
You know,
you agreed to give this a chance.

732
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,810
That means unplugging that little
cash register you got in your head.

733
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,563
Sorry. Sometimes, it's on autopilot.

734
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,066
But I still don't get
what all this is for.

735
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,820
To raise money for things that
we can't get donated, like generators.

736
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:36,488
We gotta raise a lot of cash.

737
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,329
More elves have arrived.

738
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,247
We'd better get to work.

739
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:46,915
"We"?

740
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,169
Our deal was you'd try to understand
what we do here.

741
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,756
The best way to understand
is to pitch in.

742
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,928
Yeah! This looks great.

743
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,140
- Do you want to do a few more?
- Yeah.

744
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:07,102
Not bad!
You've weaved palm leaves before?

745
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:11,523
Last weaving I did was
friendship bracelets,

746
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,692
Camp Tabonga, 11 years old.

747
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:19,156
You know, I've been part of the Drop
since I was a little girl.

748
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:25,621
My dad came from one of the islands.
Now my daughter and my grandson help, too.

749
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,374
Well, hello there.

750
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:31,377
- Hey.
- I see Andrew's already put you to work.

751
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,962
Yeah. He seems to have a talent for that.

752
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:38,342
Well, no time for people to be homesick
when they have got something to do, right?

753
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:41,178
Hey, Blitzen… need your help over here.

754
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:49,478
We were making palm-leaf wreathes.

755
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:50,979
Eh, we're resourceful.

756
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:55,734
Instead of holly and mistletoe,
we got flame tree flowers.

757
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,236
Gotta improvise a bit on traditions.

758
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:00,531
So fruitcake made
with papaya and pineapple?

759
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:03,200
Instead of Christmas ham,
you got Christmas Spam.

760
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:05,744
Instead of sledding
at grandma's backyard?

761
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,955
Christmas snorkeling on the reef.

762
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,332
Oh! That'd be fun.

763
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:12,543
Wait.

764
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,337
You've never been Christmas snorkeling?

765
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:19,633
I've never been Christmas, Easter,
or Valentine's snorkeling.

766
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:24,555
- You don't know what you're missin'.
- I've never even worn a snorkel.

767
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,891
Closest I have come is swimming through
budget reports while holding my nose.

768
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:41,405
- Long day.
- Mm-hm.

769
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,449
- But a good one.
- That we can agree on.

770
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,577
So, I have a question.

771
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,620
You're an officer, so…

772
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,373
Why aren't you spending Christmas at home?

773
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:57,921
Well… right now, I'm commanding my unit,
so I have to be here.

774
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,300
But you're right.
I could… pull some strings.

775
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,846
I'm also the only one here who's
an air logistics planner and a pilot,

776
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,932
so the Christmas Drop needs
someone with my…

777
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:10,809
How should I put it?

778
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,270
Unique skill at finagling things.

779
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,650
What's your excuse?
You could be anywhere, and you're here.

780
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:25,324
I have a lot riding on this assignment.
A promotion, maybe a really big one and…

781
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:30,788
Anyways, I like to stay
in motion during Christmas these days.

782
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,999
By working over the holidays?
Don't you wanna be home?

783
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,129
My mom passed away three years ago, so…

784
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:41,673
I'm really sorry.

785
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:45,677
We used to have Christmas caroling
by the fire and…

786
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,556
My mom's voice was loudest of all.

787
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:54,770
There was mulled cider
and gingerbread and…

788
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:00,025
Now it's just not the same, so…

789
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:02,528
Especially since my dad got remarried
last year.

790
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,530
Ouch.

791
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,200
No, she's nice, actually. She is.

792
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:10,118
- She's just...
- Not your mom?

793
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:11,662
Not my mom.

794
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:17,000
Well, if there is one thing I've learned
out here on this island,

795
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,336
it's that, though you never wanna
forget your traditions,

796
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:21,547
there's always room to make new ones.

797
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,510
So, tomorrow, we go Christmas snorkeling.

798
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,639
- No. It's already been 24 hours!
- What?

799
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,975
- We need to hit it hard tomorrow.
- Sleeping doesn't count.

800
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,935
- You're still on the hook for 12 hours.
- My gosh!

801
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,020
You're always working an angle,
aren't you?

802
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,776
Better go, I guess.

803
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:44,611
Work and…

804
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:45,737
Yeah.

805
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,407
- Find you in the morning?
- Yep.

806
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:49,408
Okay.

807
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:13,807
{\an8}<i>The big news is,</i>
<i>Sheila tendered her resignation.</i>

808
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:14,725
Shut up.

809
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:18,061
<i>Congresswoman Bradford now
officially needs a new chief of staff.</i>

810
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:21,148
Oh! And I'm 8,000 miles away,
chasing my tail.

811
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,859
<i>I'm pretty sure
you're still on the top of her list.</i>

812
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:26,028
<i>She asked me for an ETA on your report</i>

813
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,821
<i>and to let you know
about the job opening up.</i>

814
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,781
I can get something to her
in a couple days.

815
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,534
<i>She'll be on a plane in two days
to Singapore</i>

816
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,244
<i>to meet with her family for the holidays.</i>

817
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,330
<i>Pretty sure she's gonna ask for it
before she leaves.</i>

818
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:39,625
Right. Um… I'll just bear down
and get it done.

819
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,503
<i>Is that a flower in your hair?</i>

820
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:50,010
Oh. Yeah. I just… took a shortcut
through some bushes. It's…

821
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,094
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

822
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,555
<i>It's not like you to take a shortcut, Er.</i>

823
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,558
<i>Sounds like that island
is working its magic on you.</i>

824
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,394
<i>Gotta go.</i>

825
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,990
<i>Oh, you should have seen</i>
<i>the carolers tonight, honey.</i>

826
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,493
<i>Three different groups
all trying to out-sing each other!</i>

827
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:16,536
<i>It was just…</i>

828
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,539
Man, I miss those cold walks
into town with you guys.

829
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,208
<i>We could have used you when we got back.</i>

830
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,669
<i>Dad made us shovel up
the path to the barn.</i>

831
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,171
<i>Even though it's still snowing.</i>

832
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:28,840
<i>I'd like to make a toast
to us being together.</i>

833
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:31,259
- <i>Oh, yes.</i>
<i>- There is nothing…</i>

834
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:34,262
<i>…like family at Christmas.</i>

835
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,431
Guys? You're breaking up.

836
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,601
Guys? Dad?

837
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,271
- And you're gone.
- Hey.

838
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:46,441
Door was just open.

839
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,860
Yeah, we… We do that here.

840
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,530
Am I interrupting? Are you…

841
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:53,031
No. No, I'm all done.

842
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,118
Everything okay?

843
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,536
Yeah. I was, uh…

844
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:02,165
Just trying to FaceTime with my family.
We were gonna have dinner together,

845
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,710
but the internet on their end
had different plans.

846
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,503
Sorry to hear that.

847
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,340
Anyway, you ready to go
Christmas snorkeling?

848
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,634
Actually, I stopped by to say I can't go.

849
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:16,179
- Really? Why not?
- I'm getting pressure from Washington.

850
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,598
- Speed things up.
- That's exactly why you have to go.

851
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,183
- Uh... I'm...
- As soon as possible.

852
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,144
Getting in the water
is the best cure for stress.

853
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,771
You come out feeling more relaxed,
more efficient…

854
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,149
If that's even possible for you.

855
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,151
Wanna be good at your job?

856
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,737
Snorkel.

857
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,535
All right. That should do it.

858
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,328
Thanks.

859
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:43,040
Ready to take the plunge?

860
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,709
As ready as I'll ever be.

861
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:47,627
- All right, let's go.
- Now?

862
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,795
- Yep.
- Okay.

863
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,244
- Whoo!
- Oh, my gosh!

864
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:09,960
That parrotfish
was like a rainbow with fins!

865
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:13,463
And the turtle, I tried to swim
back to it, but it kept getting away.

866
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:17,342
And just like that,
a new Christmas tradition is born.

867
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:26,017
The Procurement Office has
a data drive ready for me,

868
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:29,104
and I have a meeting with the general
at Wing Headquarters in an hour.

869
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:30,689
Suit yourself.

870
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:33,567
I've gotta do a bit of horse-trading
for the fundraiser tonight anyway.

871
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,609
Okay.

872
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,196
Captain!
Your shipment's arrived.

873
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,406
I see that!

874
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:44,911
Wait. Three... How did you get
ten Douglas firs halfway across the world?

875
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,455
It's not gonna end up
in some sort of report, is it?

876
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:50,167
I promise you
it didn't cost the taxpayers a penny.

877
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,127
I find that hard to believe.

878
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:54,588
So a guy I know in Oregon
owns a tree farm.

879
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:58,133
He donated ten trees and dropped them off
at Portland at the Air National Guard.

880
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:01,094
They flew them to San Diego because
they were going there for training.

881
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,804
And a buddy at the Naval Air Station there

882
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:05,557
was flying a C-40 of recruits
to Pearl Harbor, so…

883
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,643
So that's only halfway.

884
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:12,772
Then, from Pearl, they ended up as freight
on a half-empty supply flight to Saipan,

885
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:16,651
where they were put on a Super Hercules
already due for depot maintenance here.

886
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:19,571
- Okay, but that doesn't...
- But nothin'.

887
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:21,907
Come see
what all this free transport gets us.

888
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:22,991
It's time to trade horses.

889
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,513
Oh!
That's the same one we had last year!

890
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,974
- Hey, Andrew! How are you?
- Hey, how you doing?

891
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:51,269
- Thank you for bringing the trees.
- Thank you for taking them.

892
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:54,731
Hello.

893
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:56,149
- How are you? Good to see you.
- Hi.

894
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,068
Watch out. It's heavy. All right.

895
00:53:58,151 --> 00:53:59,444
Put them in the lobby.

896
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,655
- Okay.
- So, what's the angle here?

897
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:04,741
Thing you gotta remember is,
it's about finding the right angle.

898
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:07,452
- They're beautiful.
- I made a deal with hotel management.

899
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:10,455
They are now officially the only resort
on the island

900
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:11,957
that carries real Douglas fir trees,

901
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,000
just in time
for the Christmas Eve banquet tonight.

902
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,335
In exchange for what?

903
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,087
Ten cases of soap, 20 sets of sheets,

904
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:20,840
15 packs of rice, six sets of pots
that their new chef doesn't really like,

905
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,634
and eight dozen eggs
for the eggnog tonight.

906
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:25,136
- All that for some trees?
- For some free trees. Yeah.

907
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,138
And…

908
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:33,228
A little one to brighten up someone's room
who's far away from home.

909
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:39,442
All right, let's, uh, finish unloading
these so we can get you back

910
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,611
so you can dive into that data drive,
meet the general,

911
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:44,030
then we have a few hours
before we put our party pants on.

912
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:46,574
Okay. Come on.

913
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:49,995
Andrew, over here!

914
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,456
- Yeah, that's it.
- Wow!

915
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,208
A flurry.

916
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,544
Coconut shavings away!

917
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,173
And that's a white Christmas
in the tropics.

918
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:04,634
Oh.

919
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:05,927
Oh, wow.

920
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:20,317
You pack a dress like this
everywhere you go?

921
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,361
Guess you're not the only one
who can horse-trade, Captain.

922
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,323
Does it look okay?

923
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:28,575
Yeah.

924
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:30,952
You look beautiful.

925
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:33,913
I like you in blue.

926
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,210
Good job, Andrew.

927
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:42,672
I mean, I never knew
coconut could stand in for snow.

928
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:46,634
Yeah. Uh, it took us a while
to figure that out.

929
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:51,306
Last year, we tried
freeze-dried potatoes au gratin.

930
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:57,520
- And, uh… it wasn't pretty.
- No?

931
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:00,273
- Hey, everybody, gather in.
- Oh, there they are.

932
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,192
Let's get this party started.

933
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:04,736
- Oh, come on. Yeah, over here.
- Come on.

934
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:05,987
Brother Bruce.

935
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,073
You ready for this, Auntie?

936
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:08,990
Let's do it.

937
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,200
Ah, ooh!

938
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:13,370
<i>Hacha, hugua, tulu!</i>

939
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,500
Whoo-hoo!

940
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:19,959
Yeah!

941
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:23,380
So…

942
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,757
So this is
what a tropical Christmas is like?

943
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,218
Like Rockefeller Plaza with palm trees.

944
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,136
Oh! I see a few guests without drinks,

945
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,139
and drinks are our biggest mark-up,
so I best be on my way.

946
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,682
- See you in a bit.
- Okay.

947
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,186
Whoo!

948
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:41,147
He's, uh… always workin' an angle, huh?

949
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,649
Oh, yeah, pretty much.

950
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,902
Yeah, smooth-talker.
Ladies must love that.

951
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,864
Actually, not really.

952
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,617
Uh, he may seem
like he's got all the moves,

953
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:56,496
but you know
how Captain got his call sign, "Claws"?

954
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:01,209
Figured it was because he had his claws
in every pretty tourist passing through.

955
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:07,215
Uh, "CLAWS," as in,
"Can't Leave Anyone Without Santa."

956
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:10,176
Cap'n steps up
whenever anybody needs help.

957
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,679
Brings Christmas to everyone, everywhere.

958
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,347
Doesn't do anything else,

959
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:18,685
and that's why he can't keep a girl
and why he's always here every holiday.

960
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:20,895
I didn't know.

961
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,983
Didn't you ever wonder
about those living quarters of his?

962
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,318
The house of boxes and books?

963
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,821
Yeah. Yeah, that one.

964
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:31,573
Captain gave up his officer's quarters

965
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,825
to make room for a family
comin' in from Hickam.

966
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:36,494
Since family housing was full,
Cap'n stepped up,

967
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:38,663
just like he always does.

968
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:41,749
And those boxes are donations
that come in throughout the year.

969
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:44,377
He stores them there
so they don't take up space on the base.

970
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:57,599
- So good, right? Yeah, love that!
- Whoo!

971
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:03,104
You want more power?
You add more solar panels,

972
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,064
and then you can have
your lights and stereo.

973
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,071
Oh, yeah, that's great. Yeah!

974
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,823
- Hey.
- Hey.

975
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:16,117
How much money do you need to raise
for the Drop?

976
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:19,454
- Ah, it's never enough.
- It's a good-sized crowd.

977
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:22,207
Should be. We plastered a bunch of flyers
at the resorts and downtown.

978
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:25,376
Hey, why is nobody dancing?

979
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,129
Secret weapon time.

980
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,256
Hey, Sunshine.

981
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,716
- Yes, sir.
- Let's do it.

982
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,259
- Oh, it's time.
- Okay. I'll see you.

983
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:37,096
You're gonna wanna see this.

984
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,018
- Here we go.
- Okay!

985
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:43,978
- You're kidding!
- Whoo!

986
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:50,902
Whoo!

987
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:52,862
All right! Go!

988
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,948
Yeah!

989
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:19,430
Okay, for my next magic trick…

990
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:22,517
- My lady, would you like to dance?
- Oh, no, thank you.

991
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,769
- Is this a Washington thing?
- I'm just gonna hold off.

992
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:25,812
Why not?

993
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:27,939
'Cause I'm a terrible dancer.

994
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,652
Just dance like no one's watching.

995
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,205
Yeah, it's for a good cause. Exactly.

996
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,418
All right!

997
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,255
Yeah.

998
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,805
- All right, girl, all right! Whoo!
- Whoo!

999
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:02,974
- Yeah, go, girl!
- Erica.

1000
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:04,142
Erica.

1001
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:07,395
Maybe dance
like a few people are watchin'.

1002
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:24,037
I just hope yours isn't
to close down our base.

1003
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:26,664
I hope not, too.

1004
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:28,249
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

1005
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,209
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

1006
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,309
I'd love to.

1007
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,760
What is it that makes you
wanna help people?

1008
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:25,723
I grew up on a farm.

1009
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:34,148
But then a bunch of our neighbors
all got together,

1010
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:35,817
and they helped us through it.

1011
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:38,319
My folks still live on that farm.

1012
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:41,948
I'll never forget the kindness
those people showed us.

1013
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,244
I guess I'm just trying to…

1014
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:48,121
Pay it forward.

1015
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:58,464
My mom taught me the noblest thing to do
was find a need and fill it.

1016
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:00,758
Find a hurt and heal it.

1017
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:05,346
One of the Air Force core values
is service before self.

1018
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:09,600
And, sometimes,
I wonder if I've drifted too far

1019
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:12,979
from the real reason that I got
into politics in the first place.

1020
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:18,317
Yesterday, I saw you give everything
that you had in your purse

1021
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:21,738
to a little girl who you barely knew.

1022
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,531
You're here.

1023
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:26,242
And you're helping.

1024
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,540
You know, I misjudged you.

1025
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:37,253
I thought you were
this self-centered egotist,

1026
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:39,714
wheeling and dealing for your own good.

1027
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:51,267
Clearly, there's more to you
than meets the eye.

1028
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,411
- Fire dancers?
- Fire!

1029
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:29,889
Is something wrong?

1030
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:33,351
I missed three calls from DC.

1031
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,353
- What?
- Yeah.

1032
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:37,313
It's, like, 4:30 in the morning there.

1033
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:39,690
Yeah, I'm gonna wait a couple hours
before I call them back.

1034
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,567
I'm pretty sure I know what it's about.

1035
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,612
Our tallies are in, Andrew.

1036
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:45,863
Thank you, ma'am.

1037
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:51,285
What? We did, like, double our numbers…

1038
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:52,203
Yeah.

1039
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:53,162
…since last year!

1040
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,956
- Well done.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

1041
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:59,544
But we're still gonna
have to prioritize our choices.

1042
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:02,547
Rice, vegetables, seeds, canopy materials.

1043
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:05,091
- I don't think there'll be much left.
- Mm.

1044
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,385
What about generators?

1045
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:11,597
I wish, but they're a big-ticket item.
We're still playing catch-up.

1046
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:14,767
I keep thinking about Ilana
and her friends with no power,

1047
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,103
no way to access a web connection
for school.

1048
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:21,315
Well, Sampson's the only one who
stocks them, and he's not willing to play.

1049
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:24,068
I might have an idea
that'll help him change his mind.

1050
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:32,118
That's a great idea!

1051
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,662
Honey, over here!

1052
01:04:34,745 --> 01:04:37,123
- I really just wanna…
- I want you to have…

1053
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:39,542
- Oh, I know!
- Yeah, it's really good.

1054
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,085
There he is. Wish me luck.

1055
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:43,504
Oh, sister, you don't need luck.
Go get 'em.

1056
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,381
Okay.

1057
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:47,717
- Oh, that sounds fun!
- Yeah, that'd be great.

1058
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:52,054
Mayor Sampson, hi. Erica Miller.
I work with Congresswoman Bradford.

1059
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,515
On the Realignment
and Closure Commission.

1060
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:55,892
- The same. Yes.
- Oh.

1061
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:58,477
Island grapevine has it
you're here to try and shutter the base.

1062
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:01,314
I'm here to make recommendations
about possible mission realignment.

1063
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:03,399
Or closure.
I know how BRACC works, Miss Miller.

1064
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:06,193
And I have to say, shutting this base
would bankrupt my business

1065
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:07,778
and a third of the rest of the island.

1066
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:11,198
I understand that, and I'm making sure
to include it all in my data collection.

1067
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:14,660
But, Mr. Sampson, I'm not at liberty
nor inclined to talk about my report.

1068
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:17,079
Fair enough.

1069
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:19,498
I actually wanna chat briefly
about Operation Christmas Drop.

1070
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:23,461
Okay. No, no. I already told Captain Jantz
those diesel generators are too expensive

1071
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:24,921
for me to give away left and right.

1072
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:27,965
Obviously. I mean, you're a businessman,
first and foremost.

1073
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:29,717
- I'm not here about your generators.
- No?

1074
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,719
No, I wanna make you
a business proposition.

1075
01:05:32,553 --> 01:05:33,387
Okay.

1076
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:36,641
Come with me.
I wanna introduce you to a friend of mine.

1077
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,935
What do you know
about solar inverters, sir?

1078
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:49,946
Second round of rice, everybody.

1079
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:52,907
One bag per box. You know what to do.

1080
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:13,552
- What?
- Yes.

1081
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:16,597
That's incredible! Oh!

1082
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,349
How? What did you say to him?

1083
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:20,643
I told him about a couple of initiatives
out of Washington

1084
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:23,604
that are encouraging businesses like his
to switch to renewable resources,

1085
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:24,981
and Brother Bruce did the rest.

1086
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:25,898
Wow.

1087
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:31,988
Guys, Erica just got Sampson to donate
three solar-powered inverters to the Drop!

1088
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:34,281
- Oh!
- Yeah!

1089
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:36,367
Nice work, Erica!

1090
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:37,910
Thank you!

1091
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:42,707
Hey, boss. General wants to see the team
in the ready room.

1092
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,210
- Whoo! Pass it to me.
- Come on.

1093
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:51,465
Next up, snorkels, fish hooks, and masks!
Let's pack it up, people.

1094
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:55,302
- You heard him. Let's go!
- Yes! Go, go, go!

1095
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:58,973
It's a rapidly intensifying
cat-four typhoon,

1096
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:02,059
and the outermost bands of this monster
look like they'll make landfall

1097
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:04,645
and sit on top of us in two days.

1098
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:07,189
130 to 150 mile an hour winds

1099
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:08,566
in the right front quadrant.

1100
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:10,609
Radius, 520 kilometers.

1101
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:12,486
Can we get over top of it?

1102
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,613
We can, but it's not gonna get
any presents delivered.

1103
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:17,116
It doesn't matter.
I can't risk anything off the tarmac

1104
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,576
with something this big in the way.

1105
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:20,077
It's moving slowly,

1106
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:22,997
building as it goes,
which is both good and bad news.

1107
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:25,249
What are the chances
it's not gonna hit us?

1108
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,419
- Slim to none.
- What about the outer Islands?

1109
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:30,254
They haven't recovered from the last one.

1110
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:34,133
Thankfully, on its current trajectory, the
worst of this one will miss them, but...

1111
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:36,635
Operation Christmas Drop
can't happen.

1112
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:37,928
Not on this schedule.

1113
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:40,931
It may be after Christmas
before we get back in the air.

1114
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:44,143
Then we need to work faster.

1115
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:45,770
Load up. Go now.

1116
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:49,148
Anyways, maybe the typhoon will veer off
in another direction.

1117
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:53,360
The furthest island is 11 hours out
and 11 hours back. We just can't make it.

1118
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:55,404
I won't put our people at risk.

1119
01:07:56,739 --> 01:08:00,367
But what we can do is keep sorting
and packing right up until we can't.

1120
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,162
And hope for a Christmas miracle.

1121
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,334
What?

1122
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:10,544
They happen.

1123
01:08:15,966 --> 01:08:18,260
All right, people. Let's get to it.

1124
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,785
All right, everybody, final items.

1125
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:46,205
Let's make sure you got school supplies.
Let's start closing it up.

1126
01:08:46,747 --> 01:08:48,499
If your friends on the Hill
could see you now.

1127
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:50,584
If they could see me now, I'd be fired.

1128
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,129
Okay, my little elves.

1129
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:54,463
Bring it in.

1130
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,174
Yeah, bring it in.

1131
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:59,135
- Come on!
- What? It's a tradition.

1132
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:00,719
- Every year?
- Yeah.

1133
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,346
- What's going on?
- Come on.

1134
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:17,611
Whoo!

1135
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:44,638
Hm. You look good in a Santa hat.

1136
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:50,811
Erica, what the heck is going on?

1137
01:09:55,649 --> 01:09:58,110
Sorry, ma'am, I wasn't expecting you.

1138
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:01,363
Sally was supposed to call and tell you
that I rerouted through Honolulu.

1139
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,490
Yeah, I missed a few calls.

1140
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:07,620
And the report that I was supposed
to have in my hands before I left.

1141
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:10,080
But, congresswoman,
you didn't have to fly in.

1142
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:13,417
Ma'am, I'm sorry to interrupt, but
I'm afraid, if anyone's to blame, it's me.

1143
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:14,752
I diverted your associate here...

1144
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:16,378
Captain, I don't know you,

1145
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:19,632
but I recognize your face
from that photo in the newspaper.

1146
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:21,926
You're part of the problem.

1147
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:24,303
Now, would you please explain to me
what's going on,

1148
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:27,598
because this is obviously
Operation Christmas Drop.

1149
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:33,938
Yeah, but, like I said,
it's all done by donations.

1150
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:37,566
It provides resources to people in need
over thousands of square miles.

1151
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,944
People who don't vote in my district.

1152
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:41,737
Now, how is this benefiting Americans?

1153
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:44,448
Congresswoman, this base is
America's forward operating outpost

1154
01:10:44,531 --> 01:10:45,574
in a region of hostile...

1155
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:48,827
Your commander already briefed me
on the base's mission.

1156
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:51,163
Then you are aware the mission
of this base is to provide

1157
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,207
a US-based war-fighting platform,

1158
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:57,878
as well as a rapid-response
humanitarian relief program worldwide.

1159
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:03,425
I'm going to Singapore in the morning,
weather permitting.

1160
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:05,135
Erica, I think it's time you went home.

1161
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:06,720
But I'm… I'm not done...

1162
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:09,181
I'm gonna let Matt and his team
take this over,

1163
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:12,268
and they can review
what you've found back in DC.

1164
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:16,397
I want you back at your desk,
doing your job.

1165
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:18,399
Lieutenant Bradley.

1166
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,824
I better go pack.

1167
01:11:27,574 --> 01:11:28,659
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1168
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:30,828
What, just like that?

1169
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,748
What happened to
"We're doing whatever it takes"?

1170
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:37,960
You heard her. My job is on the line.

1171
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:40,421
The winds are picking up,
and the typhoon is on its way.

1172
01:11:40,504 --> 01:11:43,549
If we speed up our packing, we can
get a drop off first, before it hits.

1173
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:47,469
I'm done with the Drop.
And if my boss has her way, you are too.

1174
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:51,223
Sorry.

1175
01:12:16,623 --> 01:12:18,250
Well, Lucky…

1176
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:21,337
Guess there's not much truth
to the island legend about you.

1177
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:33,057
- Hey.
- <i>Listen, I am so sorry you got blindsided.</i>

1178
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,017
- It's okay.
<i>- She was supposed to go to Singapore.</i>

1179
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:36,685
<i>- I kept trying your cell.</i>
- Sal!

1180
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:39,021
It's okay. I don't know
what I would have done differently,

1181
01:12:39,104 --> 01:12:41,065
even if I'd known she was coming, so…

1182
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:45,235
Just finished packing
and saying goodbye to a friend.

1183
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:47,279
<i>That pilot?</i>

1184
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:52,242
Actually, this one is green
with four legs.

1185
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:53,911
I've grown kind of fond of him.

1186
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,794
You sure about coming back home now?

1187
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,381
<i>What can I do?</i>

1188
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:08,092
<i>Bradford was crystal clear.</i>

1189
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,427
It's just not like you to give up.

1190
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:14,932
I know. And this is the first Christmas
I've actually enjoyed in a while.

1191
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:25,567
It reminds me of something.

1192
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:27,111
<i>Reminds you of what?</i>

1193
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:29,696
Of Christmas.

1194
01:13:32,449 --> 01:13:33,784
Like it used to be.

1195
01:13:38,997 --> 01:13:40,666
Sally, I have to go.

1196
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:43,293
I've got something I have to finish.

1197
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:55,305
Jake, how about
another cranberry and soda?

1198
01:13:56,014 --> 01:13:57,015
Comin' up.

1199
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:02,146
You can go home to your family, man.
I'll lock up when I leave.

1200
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,816
Thanks, Captain. Merry Christmas.

1201
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:33,302
Of all the gin joints in all the towns
in all the world…

1202
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:35,471
Don't you have a flight to catch?

1203
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:38,390
- Could say the same thing to you.
- Drop's a bust.

1204
01:14:39,516 --> 01:14:41,518
Guess we're all out
of Christmas miracles this year.

1205
01:14:42,102 --> 01:14:44,438
- So, you're just gonna give up?
- Look who's talking.

1206
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:51,028
We should get you to the airport
while your flight can still take off.

1207
01:14:51,111 --> 01:14:52,404
I don't care about my flight.

1208
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:55,991
It's yours I'm thinking about.
This weather doesn't have to ground you.

1209
01:14:57,618 --> 01:14:58,911
It has grounded me.

1210
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:02,831
I just saw a Christmas tree
that made its way

1211
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:05,959
all the way from Oregon
to San Diego to Saipan…

1212
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:10,047
To my living room in Guam.

1213
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,218
Where there's a will, there's a way…

1214
01:15:15,135 --> 01:15:17,012
Especially at Christmas.

1215
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:20,015
It's a lost cause.

1216
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:22,643
The general grounded all transport.

1217
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:24,603
There are no lost causes.

1218
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:27,814
- Wishing it won't make it happen.
- It's not a wish.

1219
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:30,984
It's a miracle.

1220
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:34,404
I just talked to Travis.

1221
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:37,699
He's been on the phone with
the Joint Typhoon Warning Center at Pearl.

1222
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:40,953
They have a P-3 over top of the storm,
and they say it's rapidly degrading.

1223
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:43,372
General Hatcher said it is up to you,

1224
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:47,000
the mission commander,
to decide if we take off.

1225
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,963
If <i>we</i> take off?

1226
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:53,423
You called me Blitzen, right?

1227
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:56,969
Isn't it my job to deliver presents
at Christmas?

1228
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:31,878
Look at everyone, giving up their time
the day before Christmas.

1229
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:32,921
Beautiful, isn't it?

1230
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:34,965
- Yeah.
- Almost as beautiful as this.

1231
01:16:35,048 --> 01:16:36,842
Can I get everyone's attention, please?

1232
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:38,885
The JTWC has just confirmed

1233
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:41,930
they downgraded the system
to a tropical storm.

1234
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:44,433
We are clear all the way
to Kapingamarangi atoll.

1235
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:47,477
Whoo!

1236
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:51,648
Then, Captain Jantz, you are green to go
with all three of Santa's sleighs.

1237
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:54,401
- Awesome! Let's get this show on the road!
- You heard her, Trav.

1238
01:16:54,484 --> 01:16:55,736
- Fire it up.
- Roger that, Claws.

1239
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:00,198
Andersen Tower, this is Santa's Helper 01.
Control departure time, 20 minutes.

1240
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:04,453
Oh, no.

1241
01:17:14,212 --> 01:17:17,215
- General. Lieutenant Colonel.
- Ma'am.

1242
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:20,636
I thought I asked you
to stop this whole Christmas thing.

1243
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,304
Yes, you did ask, congresswoman.

1244
01:17:22,387 --> 01:17:27,017
And I thought I was quite clear that
I wanted you on a plane stateside today.

1245
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:29,561
You were clear, ma'am,
but there's too much for me to do here.

1246
01:17:30,562 --> 01:17:31,396
I'm sorry?

1247
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,940
Respectfully, ma'am, what's happening here
is far more important

1248
01:17:34,024 --> 01:17:35,400
than what I'd be doing back home.

1249
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:38,362
You're very close
to throwing it all away, Ms. Miller.

1250
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:44,117
I'm gonna stay here and help.

1251
01:17:45,535 --> 01:17:47,120
And you should too.

1252
01:17:49,247 --> 01:17:51,124
I remember, when you first got elected,

1253
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:54,670
the cornerstone of your campaign
was to make the world a better place.

1254
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:58,924
You promised your constituents that
you would work on making a difference.

1255
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:00,509
These people,

1256
01:18:01,593 --> 01:18:02,594
right here,

1257
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,222
are making that difference.

1258
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:08,767
I haven't seen any evidence...

1259
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:11,061
Well, I can show you some, congresswoman.

1260
01:18:11,144 --> 01:18:13,105
Come fly with us today,
see what we do up there.

1261
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:14,231
I don't think the optics...

1262
01:18:14,314 --> 01:18:16,983
No one has to know who you are
or where you're from.

1263
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:19,027
Erica can fly with Captain Jantz
and his crew.

1264
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:20,278
You come with me and mine.

1265
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:21,655
Give it a chance, ma'am.

1266
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:24,700
I'll meet you afterwards,
and I'll give you my report.

1267
01:18:40,006 --> 01:18:40,924
Okay?

1268
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:42,718
Okay.

1269
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:13,081
Tower, this is Santa 01.
We're ready for departure.

1270
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:17,210
<i>Roger, Santa 01. Clear for takeoff.</i>
<i>Operation Christmas Drop up and away.</i>

1271
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:40,150
Sure is beautiful, huh?

1272
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:42,527
I know what you mean.

1273
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,616
Shouldn't you be keeping your eyes
on the road, Captain?

1274
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:51,536
Sorry, momentarily distracted.

1275
01:19:53,663 --> 01:19:56,625
Aah. Can't deliver presents
without the right music.

1276
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,818
All right, crew, we're coming up
on the first drop. Ready, Cargo?

1277
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,570
- You bet.
- Cargo's ready, Captain.

1278
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:27,697
<i>Roger that. Three minutes out.</i>

1279
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:33,870
Erica, why don't you go back to watch?
Sunshine will hook you up.

1280
01:20:35,288 --> 01:20:36,414
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1281
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:40,210
Sure. Yeah!

1282
01:20:51,471 --> 01:20:53,139
Put it on like a vest.

1283
01:21:00,146 --> 01:21:02,858
All right,
we're all buckled up back here, Cap.

1284
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:04,526
<i>Copy that, Cargo.</i>

1285
01:21:04,609 --> 01:21:05,777
- Hold on to this.
- Okay.

1286
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:08,363
Door's clear to open.

1287
01:21:25,505 --> 01:21:26,464
One minute out.

1288
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:28,383
Acknowledge, Computer Drop Switch.

1289
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:34,347
Set auto.

1290
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:35,599
Auto set.

1291
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,063
- Thirty sec out.
- Copy.

1292
01:21:46,651 --> 01:21:47,903
Green light.

1293
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:08,757
Whoo!

1294
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:14,554
Aah-ooh!

1295
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:16,389
- Yeah!
- Mmm!

1296
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:24,064
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

1297
01:22:24,147 --> 01:22:27,567
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo!

1298
01:22:37,077 --> 01:22:39,663
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

1299
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:41,498
Yeah!

1300
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:51,383
Whoo!

1301
01:22:57,013 --> 01:22:59,683
Whoo-hoo! Nice one, Erica!

1302
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:16,199
Cool! Toys! And books!

1303
01:23:18,201 --> 01:23:22,038
Uncle, look at all this stuff!
Look what Santa brought!

1304
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:27,377
Bye! Bye!

1305
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:39,347
Yeah!

1306
01:23:45,645 --> 01:23:47,355
Hey. Is everything okay?

1307
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:49,065
Better than okay!

1308
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:51,359
This is what Christmas
is supposed to feel like.

1309
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:52,444
Yeah, it is.

1310
01:24:04,122 --> 01:24:05,331
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

1311
01:24:05,415 --> 01:24:07,500
- All right!
- Yeah!

1312
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:08,835
Whoo!

1313
01:24:08,918 --> 01:24:10,378
- We did it!
- We did!

1314
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:11,296
We did that!

1315
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:13,882
The other planes are reporting
100% successful drops too!

1316
01:24:13,965 --> 01:24:15,050
Wow!

1317
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:19,012
- So good.
- Way to go. Way to go.

1318
01:24:20,972 --> 01:24:22,932
Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel Blaine.

1319
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:25,643
That was… spectacular.

1320
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:29,522
And very moving.

1321
01:24:30,523 --> 01:24:33,068
Well, you are more
than welcome, congresswoman.

1322
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:35,695
Please let me know if there is
anything else I can help you with

1323
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:38,239
once you guys have had your talk.

1324
01:24:48,374 --> 01:24:50,752
The base could cut waste
and maximize efficiencies

1325
01:24:50,835 --> 01:24:53,213
by privatizing housing
and base support functions,

1326
01:24:53,296 --> 01:24:56,132
like the gym, dining hall,

1327
01:24:56,758 --> 01:25:00,178
postal support,
all contracted out to reduce the overhead.

1328
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:01,596
I'll have to see the numbers.

1329
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:03,807
Yeah. Sally is working with Matt
on getting them for you

1330
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:05,475
by the time you hit Singapore.

1331
01:25:05,558 --> 01:25:07,811
I don't know if it's gonna be enough.

1332
01:25:07,894 --> 01:25:12,398
Ma'am, my task here
was to find the inefficiencies.

1333
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:16,861
The problem is there just aren't enough
to justify shutting down this base.

1334
01:25:18,029 --> 01:25:23,868
These men and women are working diligently
at stretching every cent they have.

1335
01:25:24,702 --> 01:25:27,747
Okay? Operation Christmas Drop
is just one example of that.

1336
01:25:27,831 --> 01:25:31,042
Lieutenant Colonel Blaine
walked me through the donations,

1337
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:32,752
the training, volunteer time.

1338
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:36,381
The Joint Chiefs call this island
an unsinkable aircraft carrier.

1339
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:39,551
Couple that with the training and the work
with the outlying communities,

1340
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:44,305
you have a very compelling argument
to take this base off of the list.

1341
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,476
Did you see…

1342
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:53,731
The look on the faces of the islanders
when they saw our planes coming in?

1343
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:55,233
I did, ma'am.

1344
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:58,820
I haven't seen that kind of joy
in a very long time.

1345
01:25:59,654 --> 01:26:03,366
To see our military making
that kind of difference in people's lives,

1346
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,537
that was what Christmas should look like.

1347
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:11,791
- You know, I couldn't agree more.
- You're very good at what you do.

1348
01:26:13,042 --> 01:26:15,670
And I'm so glad you're working with me.

1349
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:18,715
See you back in DC.

1350
01:26:18,798 --> 01:26:22,594
There is an empty desk there
waiting for someone like you to fill it.

1351
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:25,763
It would be my honor, ma'am.

1352
01:26:27,056 --> 01:26:32,562
And thank you… for reminding me
why I got into this in the first place.

1353
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,066
Merry Christmas, Erica.

1354
01:26:37,817 --> 01:26:39,527
Merry Christmas, Angela.

1355
01:27:01,925 --> 01:27:04,719
- So, was that a "you're fired" hug?
- Eh…

1356
01:27:04,802 --> 01:27:06,846
No.

1357
01:27:07,764 --> 01:27:09,265
I just wanna thank you…

1358
01:27:10,975 --> 01:27:13,436
For getting me involved
in everything around here.

1359
01:27:15,355 --> 01:27:18,191
Helping play Santa
got my Christmas spirit back.

1360
01:27:20,818 --> 01:27:22,904
Somethin' told me you had it all along.

1361
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:31,412
So…

1362
01:27:32,622 --> 01:27:35,124
Christmas Eve
on the other side of the world.

1363
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:38,878
Yeah. It's not home,
but we try to make it feel that way.

1364
01:27:39,712 --> 01:27:42,715
It's not really home though,
not without family.

1365
01:27:43,466 --> 01:27:47,262
Yeah, well,
my family is 8,000 miles away, so…

1366
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:50,056
Actually, they're only
about 80 yards away.

1367
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:52,433
They flew in this afternoon.

1368
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:55,979
They're getting ready for Christmas dinner
at the general's house.

1369
01:27:58,147 --> 01:27:59,190
What are you talking about?

1370
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:02,026
You're not the only one
that can cut through red tape.

1371
01:28:04,445 --> 01:28:07,615
Thank you for having us.
This is really great.

1372
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:10,034
Uh… What?

1373
01:28:11,369 --> 01:28:13,162
That... that must've cost a fortune.

1374
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:15,623
Didn't cost a cent.

1375
01:28:16,207 --> 01:28:18,960
There was a TV news crew already flying in
to cover the Drop.

1376
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:20,628
A news reporter owed me a favor.

1377
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:23,423
There was some space on the plane,
and I guess I was…

1378
01:28:24,173 --> 01:28:25,341
Feeling inspired.

1379
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:28,177
Someone once made me see
that, sometimes in life,

1380
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:30,263
you just have to find the right angle.

1381
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:36,311
You're incredible!

1382
01:28:40,523 --> 01:28:41,691
What about your family?

1383
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:48,614
I'm gonna see them for a week
at New Year's.

1384
01:28:49,282 --> 01:28:50,116
A whole week?

1385
01:28:50,199 --> 01:28:51,576
- Yeah.
- That's awesome!

1386
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:54,537
Yeah. I have to give my stepmom a chance.

1387
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:01,169
Can you spend Christmas
with my family this year?

1388
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:04,797
- Maybe we'll throw snorkeling in.
- Andrew.

1389
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:06,674
You don't have to talk me into anything.

1389
01:29:07,305 --> 01:30:07,178

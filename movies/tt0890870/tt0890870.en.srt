2
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:03,468
The subject's name is John Kramer,

3
00:02:03,543 --> 00:02:06,376
a 52-year-old male Caucasian.

4
00:02:08,482 --> 00:02:10,347
He's seen better days.

5
00:02:45,786 --> 00:02:48,007
We have a recent rectangular
transection

6
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:50,348
to the left occipital lobe.

7
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:53,584
Some kind of backdoor
brain surgery.

8
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:27,183
Let's check the stomach.

9
00:04:45,238 --> 00:04:48,230
What the hell?

10
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,343
Get homicide here, now.

11
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:02,588
Where is it?

12
00:05:02,656 --> 00:05:05,352
It was in his stomach.

13
00:05:07,227 --> 00:05:08,694
Cut it out.

14
00:05:42,162 --> 00:05:44,130
Are you there, Detective?

15
00:05:44,197 --> 00:05:46,392
If so, you are probably

16
00:05:46,466 --> 00:05:48,764
the last man standing.

17
00:05:48,835 --> 00:05:51,235
Now perhaps you will succeed

18
00:05:51,304 --> 00:05:53,738
where the others have failed.

19
00:05:53,807 --> 00:05:56,708
You think you will
walk away untested?

20
00:05:56,776 --> 00:05:58,573
I promise

21
00:05:58,645 --> 00:06:01,079
that my work will continue.

22
00:06:01,148 --> 00:06:04,140
You think it's over
just because I'm dead?

23
00:06:04,217 --> 00:06:06,185
It's not over.

24
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:08,813
The games have just begun.

25
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:24,863
What the fuck? What the fuck?

26
00:06:25,906 --> 00:06:27,874
What the fuck?

27
00:06:27,941 --> 00:06:30,739
My eyes!

28
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,176
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

29
00:06:33,246 --> 00:06:35,646
What the fuck is this?

30
00:06:45,525 --> 00:06:46,822
Who's that?

31
00:06:48,295 --> 00:06:50,661
Talk to me.
What are you doing?

32
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,698
Talk to me.

33
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:07,339
Talk to me.

34
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:16,313
Stop it!

35
00:07:17,824 --> 00:07:19,314
Stop.

36
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,559
Stop it.

37
00:07:50,457 --> 00:07:53,085
What are you doing to me?

38
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,593
What did I do?
Help!

39
00:07:55,662 --> 00:07:57,027
Help!

40
00:07:57,097 --> 00:07:59,531
Who's doing this to me?

41
00:08:14,414 --> 00:08:16,314
Just get away from me!

42
00:08:22,856 --> 00:08:24,847
What did I do?

43
00:09:57,517 --> 00:10:00,577
- Right side clear.
- Left side clear.

44
00:10:00,653 --> 00:10:01,915
Clear.

45
00:10:06,126 --> 00:10:08,356
In position.
Standing by.

46
00:10:08,428 --> 00:10:10,396
Hold right there.

47
00:10:12,332 --> 00:10:13,765
I see movement.

48
00:10:18,605 --> 00:10:20,698
We have a device.

49
00:10:20,774 --> 00:10:22,241
You get eyes in there
before you go in.

50
00:10:22,308 --> 00:10:24,538
Get some eyes in here.

51
00:10:24,611 --> 00:10:26,579
Moving now.

52
00:10:42,462 --> 00:10:43,724
The doorway is clear.

53
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:20,694
It's Kerry!

54
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:23,133
- Rigg!
- Don't do it! We're not secure!

55
00:11:23,203 --> 00:11:25,171
- Rigg, I said no!
- Kerry!

56
00:11:25,238 --> 00:11:27,433
- Stop him!
- Do not go through that door.

57
00:11:28,475 --> 00:11:30,443
Kerry!

58
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,478
Shit.

59
00:11:56,102 --> 00:11:58,070
- Get me the coroner's office.
- Copy.

60
00:11:58,137 --> 00:12:00,105
Somebody get those rats off her.

61
00:12:05,478 --> 00:12:07,810
Let's get the light on this.

62
00:12:11,184 --> 00:12:13,175
Cut her down.

63
00:12:13,253 --> 00:12:15,084
You know I can't do that.

64
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,622
I said cut her down.

65
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,255
Please.

66
00:12:29,969 --> 00:12:31,732
Are you trying
to get yourself killed?

67
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:36,071
You know never to go
through an unsecured door, ever.

68
00:12:36,142 --> 00:12:38,007
I thought she was still alive,

69
00:12:38,077 --> 00:12:40,705
thought I could save her.

70
00:12:41,881 --> 00:12:43,849
Did you ever think
that we would end up here

71
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:45,885
when we first started?

72
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,647
No.

73
00:12:49,722 --> 00:12:52,122
I didn't see it
happening like this.

74
00:12:55,228 --> 00:12:56,718
Why the hell do we still do it?

75
00:12:56,796 --> 00:12:59,356
It's in our nature to save them.

76
00:12:59,432 --> 00:13:02,128
- It's what we do.
- Right.

77
00:13:03,202 --> 00:13:05,534
"Cherish Your Life."

78
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:07,402
- What?
- The fucking motto.

79
00:13:07,473 --> 00:13:10,601
We're supposed to cherish
our lives.

80
00:13:10,677 --> 00:13:12,235
How the hell are we
supposed to do that

81
00:13:12,312 --> 00:13:14,280
when this is our life?

82
00:13:18,384 --> 00:13:20,409
We chose this.

83
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:22,351
- You go home.
- Hoffman, there are two agents

84
00:13:22,422 --> 00:13:24,822
- here to see you.
- Copy.

85
00:13:27,694 --> 00:13:29,889
- Detective Hoffman?
- Yes.

86
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:32,329
I'm special agent Lindsey Perez.

87
00:13:32,398 --> 00:13:34,161
This is special agent Peter Strahm.

88
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:36,292
How can I help the FBI?

89
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:39,736
We're here about Detective Kerry.
She was our liaison.

90
00:13:39,806 --> 00:13:41,535
"Open the door
and you will find me."

91
00:13:42,575 --> 00:13:44,099
What?

92
00:13:48,781 --> 00:13:50,942
- What's this?
- The key that came

93
00:13:51,017 --> 00:13:52,917
with out last message
from Detective Kerry.

94
00:13:52,986 --> 00:13:55,477
"Open the door and you will find me"
mean anything to you?

95
00:13:55,555 --> 00:13:57,182
No.

96
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:06,959
Where's the body?

97
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:10,525
The crime scene photographer's flash
picked up this bullet casing.

98
00:14:10,603 --> 00:14:12,730
It was lodged between the body
and the device.

99
00:14:12,805 --> 00:14:14,773
Run it for prints.

100
00:14:21,814 --> 00:14:24,044
Give us the room for a minute,
would you? Thanks.

101
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:32,223
The lock was open.

102
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,724
She couldn't get out.

103
00:14:33,793 --> 00:14:37,695
It was constructed for her execution.
Betrayed the rules.

104
00:14:37,764 --> 00:14:39,493
Not a Jigsaw trap then?

105
00:14:39,565 --> 00:14:42,056
No, Amanda Young,
the accomplice...

106
00:14:42,135 --> 00:14:44,865
- This wasn't done by Amanda Young.
- Excuse me?

107
00:14:44,937 --> 00:14:47,201
Detective Kerry weighed
approximately 130 lbs.

108
00:14:47,273 --> 00:14:49,241
Amanda Young's arrest report
has her at 107.

109
00:14:49,308 --> 00:14:51,503
- She couldn't get her up there alone.
- John Kramer was...

110
00:14:51,577 --> 00:14:54,045
The bedridden cancer patient?
He's brains, not brawn.

111
00:14:54,113 --> 00:14:56,240
He was also an engineer.
He could have rigged pulleys...

112
00:14:56,315 --> 00:14:59,375
Or someone else
could have helped him.

113
00:14:59,452 --> 00:15:02,512
Special agent, if you're here for any
other reason than just to assist...

114
00:15:02,588 --> 00:15:05,079
We're here to find the person
your department couldn't, Detective,

115
00:15:05,158 --> 00:15:06,921
the one helping Jigsaw
and Amanda Young.

116
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:09,962
Excuse me.

117
00:15:15,935 --> 00:15:18,961
We found a harlequin doll in your
possession. What's that about?

118
00:15:19,038 --> 00:15:21,233
It's a toy.
The kids play with toys.

119
00:15:21,307 --> 00:15:23,741
That's all it is.

120
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,904
How about the tricycle?

121
00:15:26,979 --> 00:15:29,072
The tricycle is from John's youth.

122
00:15:29,148 --> 00:15:32,208
A grown man has
a tricycle his whole life?

123
00:15:32,285 --> 00:15:34,480
I'm sure you've kept things
that were important to you.

124
00:15:34,554 --> 00:15:36,647
Look, Ms. Tuck,

125
00:15:36,723 --> 00:15:38,691
is there any reason
we should be concerned

126
00:15:38,758 --> 00:15:40,817
for your safety?

127
00:15:40,893 --> 00:15:43,225
Perhaps you should be
more concerned for yourself.

128
00:15:43,296 --> 00:15:45,264
Why don't you tell me
everything you know about John?

129
00:15:45,331 --> 00:15:46,821
And let's start at the beginning.

130
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:50,562
John's life defies chronology
and linear description.

131
00:15:50,636 --> 00:15:53,969
So why don't we start at the end
and work our way backwards?

132
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,598
I represent Ms. Tuck.

133
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,639
She knows something.

134
00:15:59,712 --> 00:16:01,771
I thought you were going home.

135
00:16:01,848 --> 00:16:05,545
You have vacation time, right?
Take it.

136
00:16:05,618 --> 00:16:07,950
Finish the remodeling,
spend some time with Tracy.

137
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,488
- She understands.
- Then don't take her for granted.

138
00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:14,857
- Eric is still out there, man.
- Eric's been missing for six months.

139
00:16:14,927 --> 00:16:17,919
Kerry was gone for four days.
I can only be as optimistic

140
00:16:17,997 --> 00:16:20,465
- as the facts allow.
- Yeah, well, I'm in it till I find him.

141
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:22,330
Finding his body is not gonna
vindicate us.

142
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:24,266
Finding him alive will.

143
00:16:24,337 --> 00:16:26,464
It's time to let go.

144
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:28,473
I want you to go home.

145
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,339
I'll call you later to make sure
everything is okay.

146
00:16:36,215 --> 00:16:37,477
Who's he?

147
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,313
Lieutenant Rigg,
our SWAT commander.

148
00:16:39,385 --> 00:16:42,752
- What's his problem?
- Everyone around him keeps dying.

149
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,244
What's it say?

150
00:17:06,312 --> 00:17:09,372
It says, "I tried calling you
four times."

151
00:17:09,448 --> 00:17:11,780
It says, "Dinner is in the fridge."

152
00:17:13,586 --> 00:17:16,953
And at the bottom it says,
"I love you."

153
00:17:17,023 --> 00:17:19,082
I need to help my mom

154
00:17:19,158 --> 00:17:21,388
for a few days.

155
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,291
Just...

156
00:17:23,362 --> 00:17:26,456
come with me, okay? Now.

157
00:17:26,532 --> 00:17:28,466
I can't.

158
00:17:30,036 --> 00:17:32,402
You can,

159
00:17:32,471 --> 00:17:34,871
but you won't.

160
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:37,205
What you can't do

161
00:17:37,276 --> 00:17:39,471
is save everyone.

162
00:17:48,721 --> 00:17:50,518
Tracy.

163
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,184
Tracy, please listen to me.

164
00:18:05,972 --> 00:18:09,408
John Kramer owned a company called
The Urban Renewal Group.

165
00:18:09,475 --> 00:18:11,568
No irony in that, huh?

166
00:18:11,644 --> 00:18:13,703
What was Rigg watching?

167
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:17,681
Jill Tuck's interrogation.
She was Jigsaw's ex. It's old.

168
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,718
Why is a SWAT guy watching that?

169
00:18:19,785 --> 00:18:23,687
Strahm, I really think
we should tell Hoffman

170
00:18:23,756 --> 00:18:25,690
what Detective Kerry said
in her last message.

171
00:18:25,758 --> 00:18:29,057
She said two officers
might be in danger,

172
00:18:29,128 --> 00:18:31,119
but until we know who,
we're not causing a panic.

173
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:33,665
If Detective Hoffman or anyone else
in this precinct is in danger,

174
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,564
- I think they should know it.
- Not your call.

175
00:18:39,472 --> 00:18:41,337
Making any progress?

176
00:18:43,075 --> 00:18:45,635
We're fine, thanks.

177
00:18:45,711 --> 00:18:48,441
Hey, boss, looks like another doctor
went missing from the hospital.

178
00:18:48,514 --> 00:18:50,448
- Maybe it's...
- Thanks.

179
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:52,484
I'll check it out.

180
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:55,520
If you need me, call my cell.
Coffee machine is around the corner.

181
00:18:55,588 --> 00:18:58,056
- A boy or a girl?
- A girl.

182
00:18:58,124 --> 00:18:59,716
- I didn't know you were married.
- I'm not.

183
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:02,317
It's a short story, believe me.

184
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,884
Tracy.

185
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:42,495
Tracy?

186
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,508
Hello, Officer Rigg.

187
00:21:29,575 --> 00:21:31,566
Welcome to your rebirth.

188
00:21:31,644 --> 00:21:32,838
Fuck.

189
00:21:32,912 --> 00:21:35,210
For years you've stood by
and witnessed

190
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:37,249
as your colleagues have fallen.

191
00:21:37,316 --> 00:21:39,910
You have remained untouched

192
00:21:39,985 --> 00:21:42,419
while Eric Matthews
has disappeared.

193
00:21:42,488 --> 00:21:45,514
But with your survival
came your obsession...

194
00:21:45,591 --> 00:21:47,559
obsession to stop
those around you

195
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:49,685
from making the wrong choices,

196
00:21:49,762 --> 00:21:52,788
thus preventing you
from making the right ones.

197
00:21:52,865 --> 00:21:54,833
You wanted to save everyone.

198
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,027
Tonight I give you
the opportunity

199
00:21:57,103 --> 00:21:59,731
to face your obsession.
Look closely.

200
00:21:59,805 --> 00:22:02,968
Eric Matthews is still alive.

201
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:05,738
- Eric.
- The block of ice he stands upon

202
00:22:05,811 --> 00:22:07,642
is melting.

203
00:22:07,713 --> 00:22:10,773
He has but 90 minutes
to save himself.

204
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,843
Detective Hoffman's fate is linked
to Eric's survival.

205
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,083
Heed my warning,
Officer Rigg.

206
00:22:18,157 --> 00:22:20,318
Their lives hang in the balance

207
00:22:20,392 --> 00:22:22,360
of your obsession.

208
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:25,625
Will you learn how to let go
and truly save them?

209
00:22:25,698 --> 00:22:27,962
The choice is yours.

210
00:23:02,801 --> 00:23:05,065
Don't fucking move.

211
00:23:19,018 --> 00:23:20,883
Jesus.

212
00:23:20,953 --> 00:23:23,547
Take off the mask.
Put your hands in the air.

213
00:23:23,622 --> 00:23:25,988
I can't!

214
00:23:38,204 --> 00:23:40,138
Officer Rigg, your first test.

215
00:23:40,206 --> 00:23:43,539
The person in front of you
is in desperate need of help.

216
00:23:43,609 --> 00:23:46,169
But it is not your job
to save them.

217
00:23:46,245 --> 00:23:48,145
You view this person as a victim.

218
00:23:48,214 --> 00:23:50,205
But if you want to see what I see,

219
00:23:50,282 --> 00:23:52,842
beneath the mask lies a criminal

220
00:23:52,918 --> 00:23:54,886
undeserving of the life she leads.

221
00:24:01,327 --> 00:24:04,490
Your obsession tells you
to save the victim.

222
00:24:04,563 --> 00:24:08,727
I tell you to walk away.
The choice is yours.

223
00:24:09,902 --> 00:24:12,029
- Are you a cop?
- What?

224
00:24:12,104 --> 00:24:14,231
- Are you a cop?
- Yeah, I'm a cop.

225
00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:20,403
What is that?
What did you do?

226
00:24:28,988 --> 00:24:31,718
- They're in the gears.
- What's in the gears?

227
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:35,089
The combination.
Get me out.

228
00:24:37,162 --> 00:24:39,687
Cut my hair. Just get me out.
Cut my hair.

229
00:24:39,765 --> 00:24:41,232
- Relax, relax.
- Hurry!

230
00:24:42,835 --> 00:24:45,235
Fucking cut my hair, please.

231
00:24:45,304 --> 00:24:46,794
Get me out!

232
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,399
Please.
Where are you going?

233
00:24:51,477 --> 00:24:53,741
Wait wait wait wait.

234
00:24:53,812 --> 00:24:55,712
Wait wait.

235
00:24:55,781 --> 00:24:56,839
- Shit.
- Wait!

236
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,846
Stop!

237
00:25:00,886 --> 00:25:02,251
Fucking let me out!

238
00:25:03,322 --> 00:25:05,756
Get back here, you fucking...!

239
00:25:06,825 --> 00:25:10,192
Okay, I'm sorry.
Please come back.

240
00:25:29,848 --> 00:25:32,578
Where the hell is the combination?

241
00:25:32,651 --> 00:25:34,482
Shit. Shit.

242
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,558
Hold on! Hold on!

243
00:25:43,495 --> 00:25:45,895
I got one.

244
00:25:45,964 --> 00:25:48,330
I got one. Hold on!

245
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,561
- Hold on.
- Hurry!

246
00:25:53,205 --> 00:25:54,968
Oh, God.

247
00:25:58,077 --> 00:26:00,671
- Yeah?
- We pulled a print off that casing.

248
00:26:00,746 --> 00:26:02,714
We've got a match.

249
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:05,249
Jesus. Did you check this?

250
00:26:05,317 --> 00:26:06,375
Twice.

251
00:26:09,555 --> 00:26:10,988
Come on, come on, come on.

252
00:26:11,056 --> 00:26:13,854
I got another one. Hold on!

253
00:26:15,861 --> 00:26:17,658
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Hurry!

254
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,857
I got it. 617. 617.

255
00:26:19,932 --> 00:26:21,900
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

256
00:26:27,873 --> 00:26:30,774
Go!

257
00:26:30,843 --> 00:26:33,710
Shit.

258
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:36,213
Okay okay okay, listen,

259
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:38,408
stay here. Don't touch anything.

260
00:27:00,572 --> 00:27:02,733
What the fuck?

261
00:27:05,511 --> 00:27:07,979
What the fuck are you doing?
What are you doing?

262
00:27:08,046 --> 00:27:09,343
Drop the fucking knife!

263
00:27:09,415 --> 00:27:11,280
- Please.
- Put the knife down.

264
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,318
Put the knife down.

265
00:27:13,385 --> 00:27:15,979
I just saved your fucking life.

266
00:27:17,823 --> 00:27:20,257
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Drop the knife.

267
00:27:28,033 --> 00:27:31,833
Hey, these prints just came in.
They're from Officer Rigg.

268
00:27:31,904 --> 00:27:33,496
- Fisk.
- Not now.

269
00:27:33,572 --> 00:27:36,200
We just got a call of "shots fired"
from 23 Park Place.

270
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:38,675
That's Rigg's apartment.

271
00:27:45,784 --> 00:27:47,752
Hello, Brenda.

272
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,845
I want to play a game.

273
00:27:49,922 --> 00:27:52,789
An officer will try to save you.

274
00:27:52,858 --> 00:27:56,624
If he is successful,
then your game begins.

275
00:27:56,695 --> 00:27:59,163
This man will use these photos

276
00:27:59,231 --> 00:28:01,859
to sentence you for your crimes.

277
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:03,902
And the only way to stop him

278
00:28:03,969 --> 00:28:05,960
is taped underneath the TV.

279
00:28:08,173 --> 00:28:10,141
Let him save your life

280
00:28:10,209 --> 00:28:12,575
and accept your fate
to rot in prison,

281
00:28:12,644 --> 00:28:15,112
or kill him

282
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,410
and guarantee your freedom.

283
00:28:17,483 --> 00:28:19,849
Make your choice.

284
00:29:24,182 --> 00:29:26,150
I'll fucking kill you,

285
00:29:26,218 --> 00:29:28,652
you fucking bitch!

286
00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:25,936
Rigg!

287
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:29,709
- Rigg, you in here? Rigg!
- Go! Move move move!

288
00:30:31,617 --> 00:30:33,585
Christ.

289
00:30:33,652 --> 00:30:35,620
I got one.

290
00:30:37,456 --> 00:30:39,424
I got one.

291
00:30:49,468 --> 00:30:51,436
It's started.

292
00:30:53,105 --> 00:30:55,630
An APB has been issued for Rigg.
Everybody's looking.

293
00:30:55,707 --> 00:30:58,733
- He has a wife. Where is she?
- We haven't located her yet.

294
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:01,472
Strahm...

295
00:31:01,546 --> 00:31:03,912
two detectives. You see this?

296
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,781
Hoffman... you got a 20 on him?

297
00:31:06,852 --> 00:31:08,183
Not yet.

298
00:31:08,253 --> 00:31:09,811
- Hoffman.
- Calling.

299
00:31:09,888 --> 00:31:11,981
How do you explain
Detective Matthews?

300
00:31:12,057 --> 00:31:13,888
- He's alive.
- Six months.

301
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:17,087
- Jigsaw never kept anyone that long.
- No one but Amanda Young.

302
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,995
You think he's been fixed?

303
00:31:20,065 --> 00:31:21,896
Why these six?

304
00:31:25,871 --> 00:31:28,533
Hoffman's a decorated lieutenant.
He doesn't fit the profile.

305
00:31:28,607 --> 00:31:31,576
That's what you see.
But what does he see?

306
00:31:32,844 --> 00:31:35,039
- Rigg trying to save his two friends.
- Maybe.

307
00:31:35,113 --> 00:31:37,547
You got names and locations
on any of these people?

308
00:31:37,616 --> 00:31:39,481
- Working it.
- This is overkill.

309
00:31:39,551 --> 00:31:42,179
It's a setup to announce
Rigg is the accomplice.

310
00:31:42,254 --> 00:31:45,121
Or a setup for his alibi.
Everyone around him keeps dying.

311
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:47,920
Where is he to tell us he's innocent
or what the hell these photos

312
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:51,121
are doing in his apartment?
Look there.

313
00:31:52,164 --> 00:31:55,133
Move, please.

314
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,395
"Four Walls Build a Home."

315
00:31:57,469 --> 00:31:59,437
What does he want us to see
on these walls?

316
00:31:59,504 --> 00:32:01,438
The victims?

317
00:32:01,506 --> 00:32:04,270
One of these pictures
doesn't belong.

318
00:32:11,316 --> 00:32:13,284
This is who we're looking for.

319
00:32:14,352 --> 00:32:16,912
Let's talk to her, now.

320
00:32:22,094 --> 00:32:24,062
Jill Tuck... where is she?

321
00:32:32,437 --> 00:32:34,997
Have them turn off the air in there.

322
00:32:42,013 --> 00:32:43,605
Ms. Tuck,

323
00:32:43,682 --> 00:32:46,742
I'm special agent Perez.
This is special agent Strahm.

324
00:32:46,818 --> 00:32:49,343
I'd like to apologize for pulling
you out of your place of work.

325
00:32:49,421 --> 00:32:51,013
What more do you think
I can offer you?

326
00:32:51,089 --> 00:32:53,956
My 100 hours of interrogation tapes

327
00:32:54,025 --> 00:32:56,255
and the volumes of evidence
taken from my house

328
00:32:56,328 --> 00:32:58,660
weren't enough for you
to understand John?

329
00:32:59,731 --> 00:33:02,700
Actually, it's not John we want
to talk about, Ms. Tuck. It's you.

330
00:33:02,768 --> 00:33:04,258
Me?

331
00:33:04,336 --> 00:33:06,896
Why do you want to talk about me?
This isn't about me.

332
00:33:06,972 --> 00:33:09,805
So stop wasting both of our time
and get to the real reason

333
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:12,275
why you've brought me here.

334
00:33:37,502 --> 00:33:39,470
Hey, you.

335
00:33:45,277 --> 00:33:47,677
Let me go!

336
00:33:47,746 --> 00:33:49,475
Hey!

337
00:33:51,383 --> 00:33:53,943
You hear me?

338
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:55,782
You fucking hear me,

339
00:33:55,854 --> 00:33:58,652
you fucking motherfucker?

340
00:34:15,774 --> 00:34:17,401
Who's my girl?

341
00:34:20,612 --> 00:34:22,580
What the fuck are you looking at?

342
00:34:22,647 --> 00:34:24,376
Huh? What the fuck...?

343
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:26,849
Hey, you!

344
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:29,512
Sir, sir,

345
00:34:29,588 --> 00:34:31,613
sir, can I help you?

346
00:35:39,224 --> 00:35:41,192
Hello, Officer Rigg.
In order for you

347
00:35:41,259 --> 00:35:43,454
to fully understand my way,

348
00:35:43,528 --> 00:35:46,986
you must...
feel what I feel.

349
00:35:47,065 --> 00:35:49,431
The photo before you is of a man

350
00:35:49,501 --> 00:35:52,800
- in desperate need of help.
- Sir?

351
00:35:52,871 --> 00:35:56,466
In the next room are the tools
to his salvation.

352
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:59,203
His life is in your hands.

353
00:35:59,277 --> 00:36:02,610
But in the end
only he can save himself.

354
00:36:04,182 --> 00:36:07,777
Be careful.
There are cameras watching...

355
00:36:10,055 --> 00:36:12,819
and you must hide your identity.

356
00:36:13,925 --> 00:36:16,450
Make your choice.

357
00:36:17,562 --> 00:36:19,587
- Sir?
- What the fuck's he doing?

358
00:36:19,664 --> 00:36:21,791
I don't know. You're gonna have to...
Look, look,

359
00:36:21,866 --> 00:36:23,857
- you're gonna have to go.
- People are trying to sleep.

360
00:36:23,935 --> 00:36:26,369
Yeah, I know people are
trying to sleep. You're the one...

361
00:36:26,438 --> 00:36:28,804
Yeah, you can't sleep here.
You have to go.

362
00:36:28,873 --> 00:36:31,205
Yeah, well, you can't sleep
in here, okay?

363
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:33,642
That's not a bed.
No, you've got to go.

364
00:36:33,712 --> 00:36:35,976
No, you can't use the bathroom.
Look, look, no.

365
00:36:36,047 --> 00:36:37,480
You're gonna have to go.
All right...

366
00:36:43,722 --> 00:36:45,713
Chance, here, girl.

367
00:36:48,827 --> 00:36:52,786
Chance. Chance.

368
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:56,927
Chance.

369
00:36:58,536 --> 00:37:00,504
What are you doing?
Come on.

370
00:37:00,572 --> 00:37:02,540
Chance.

371
00:37:09,247 --> 00:37:11,579
Chance, come here.
Come here.

372
00:37:19,758 --> 00:37:22,249
What you got there, huh?
What you got?

373
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:24,693
Come here. Come here.
What do you got there?

374
00:37:33,405 --> 00:37:38,172
Okay, "Four walls build a home."

375
00:37:38,243 --> 00:37:41,474
- Care to shed any light on that?
- Light on what?

376
00:37:41,546 --> 00:37:43,639
On what your photos are doing
at the crime scene.

377
00:37:46,818 --> 00:37:48,979
"Four walls build a home"
ring any bells?

378
00:37:50,822 --> 00:37:53,256
"Cherish your life"?

379
00:37:54,626 --> 00:37:56,594
"Cherish your life"
is the concept

380
00:37:56,661 --> 00:37:58,629
that this whole clinic
was built on...

381
00:37:58,696 --> 00:38:00,721
cherish your life... your life.

382
00:38:00,799 --> 00:38:03,666
- That's his motto.
- No, it's your motto...

383
00:38:03,735 --> 00:38:06,431
of the clinic you run.

384
00:38:06,504 --> 00:38:09,803
Fuck, man.
I've been here for three fucking hours!

385
00:38:09,874 --> 00:38:12,274
- Shut the fuck up.
- You shut up.

386
00:38:12,343 --> 00:38:14,106
Are you out of your fucking mind?

387
00:38:14,179 --> 00:38:16,170
Hey hey.

388
00:38:16,247 --> 00:38:18,147
Hey, guys, come on.
Calm down.

389
00:38:18,216 --> 00:38:20,241
Cecil!

390
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:22,445
Stop it, Gus.

391
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,818
Knock it off now, please!

392
00:38:29,561 --> 00:38:31,426
You don't want to do that.

393
00:38:31,496 --> 00:38:33,657
- What the fuck is your problem?
- You're my problem.

394
00:38:34,699 --> 00:38:37,600
You're becoming
everybody else's too.

395
00:38:45,176 --> 00:38:49,169
How do you feel about a husband

396
00:38:49,247 --> 00:38:51,772
who takes a motto
from your drug clinic,

397
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:54,148
designed to help people,
and twists it

398
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:57,279
into some manic torture mantra?

399
00:38:57,355 --> 00:39:00,882
That part of John
has nothing to do with me.

400
00:39:04,028 --> 00:39:05,996
Look, Ms. Tuck,
I just left a room

401
00:39:06,064 --> 00:39:08,032
with more blood on the walls
than paint.

402
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:10,932
Two officers are missing and
there's a growing pile of bodies

403
00:39:11,002 --> 00:39:14,438
in their wake.
And every detail we unearth

404
00:39:14,506 --> 00:39:17,168
about your Hall of Fame
psychopath husband...

405
00:39:17,242 --> 00:39:18,869
- Ex.
...points to you

406
00:39:18,943 --> 00:39:20,740
as a possible accomplice.

407
00:39:20,812 --> 00:39:24,077
I am just curious as to why.

408
00:39:24,149 --> 00:39:26,174
You know, there's a lot of people
out there

409
00:39:26,251 --> 00:39:28,219
looking for answers,

410
00:39:28,286 --> 00:39:30,516
wanting to place blame
on someone.

411
00:39:30,588 --> 00:39:33,421
That person is you.

412
00:39:33,491 --> 00:39:35,584
But you know
what the best part is?

413
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,890
I don't have to
convince everybody.

414
00:39:37,962 --> 00:39:40,157
Just 12 people.

415
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:45,630
Okay, tell me
about his workshop.

416
00:39:51,676 --> 00:39:54,042
Stay there.
Let me get the lights.

417
00:39:57,549 --> 00:39:58,914
Wow, it's big.

418
00:39:58,983 --> 00:40:02,214
This is exactly
what you've been looking for.

419
00:40:02,287 --> 00:40:03,549
Nice, huh?

420
00:40:04,722 --> 00:40:06,349
Ta-da!

421
00:40:06,424 --> 00:40:10,019
This is the clock?
What's so special about it?

422
00:40:10,094 --> 00:40:12,255
Except for the fact
the whole deal hung on it?

423
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:14,230
The mechanism inside it.

424
00:40:14,299 --> 00:40:16,529
It's 300 years old.

425
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:18,535
Still ticking.

426
00:40:18,603 --> 00:40:21,595
Withstood the test of time.

427
00:40:24,075 --> 00:40:27,101
Wait till you see this space.

428
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:34,249
I've got a surprise for you.

429
00:40:48,633 --> 00:40:50,601
Why are you doing this?

430
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,338
Why?

431
00:40:58,109 --> 00:41:00,236
This was... this was a mistake.

432
00:41:00,311 --> 00:41:03,747
It happened a long time ago.
And I paid for this.

433
00:41:03,815 --> 00:41:05,612
Just let me...
just let me go, okay?

434
00:41:08,853 --> 00:41:11,117
What's behind that door?

435
00:41:11,189 --> 00:41:14,522
"One saves a life.
One takes it away."

436
00:41:17,061 --> 00:41:19,029
Try that on the door.
Try that.

437
00:41:24,702 --> 00:41:26,727
- Oh, no no.
- Get back. Get back. Get back.

438
00:41:26,804 --> 00:41:28,396
Let's go. Go.

439
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:04,867
Eric. Jesus.

440
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:07,706
- Help! Help me!
- Get away from there.

441
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,349
What do you know about the guy on TV?
What do you know about Eric Matthews?

442
00:42:12,417 --> 00:42:14,385
I don't know who that is.

443
00:42:16,387 --> 00:42:18,582
- What the fuck is this?
- I don't know.

444
00:42:22,427 --> 00:42:25,021
What are you gonna do to me?

445
00:42:27,265 --> 00:42:30,257
If you are playing this tape,
then you are one step closer

446
00:42:30,335 --> 00:42:33,463
to truly understanding
how to save a life.

447
00:42:33,538 --> 00:42:36,336
As an officer of the law,
you find yourself torn...

448
00:42:36,407 --> 00:42:38,102
- Who is that?
- Shut up.

449
00:42:38,176 --> 00:42:41,339
- is the man before you a victim
or a perpetrator of violence?

450
00:42:43,147 --> 00:42:44,614
You sick fuck.

451
00:42:44,682 --> 00:42:46,912
His salvation is out of your hands.

452
00:42:49,754 --> 00:42:51,585
It is your choice, if you wish,

453
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:53,624
to put it into his own.

454
00:42:53,691 --> 00:42:55,659
Once this lesson is learned,

455
00:42:55,727 --> 00:42:57,718
you will find yourself
one step closer

456
00:42:57,795 --> 00:43:00,355
to truly saving Eric Matthews.

457
00:43:00,431 --> 00:43:03,400
Without you this man's game
cannot begin.

458
00:43:03,468 --> 00:43:06,995
Force him into position
to face his demons

459
00:43:07,071 --> 00:43:10,063
and let him make the decision.

460
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,740
Shh. Don't wake up our neighbors.

461
00:43:21,085 --> 00:43:24,179
Fuck. Is this what you do
with your spare time, huh?

462
00:43:24,255 --> 00:43:25,381
No.

463
00:43:25,456 --> 00:43:28,254
Take it all, little girl.
Be a good little whore.

464
00:43:28,326 --> 00:43:30,988
Get on the fucking bed.
Get on the bed!

465
00:43:31,062 --> 00:43:33,428
Move!

466
00:43:33,498 --> 00:43:36,058
Strap yourself in.
Strap yourself in.

467
00:43:36,134 --> 00:43:38,261
Please don't make me do this.
I know...

468
00:43:38,336 --> 00:43:40,497
I know I was wrong.
I know.

469
00:43:42,473 --> 00:43:44,600
Hurry up. Hurry up.

470
00:43:44,675 --> 00:43:47,508
Put your fucking hands up.

471
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,075
I don't know. I don't know.

472
00:43:51,149 --> 00:43:52,480
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

473
00:43:56,721 --> 00:43:59,781
Listen, I'm really sorry.

474
00:43:59,857 --> 00:44:02,985
What does that say?
What does that say?

475
00:44:04,328 --> 00:44:06,159
What is that?

476
00:44:10,168 --> 00:44:12,466
- Take them.
- Why?

477
00:44:16,741 --> 00:44:19,107
Hello, Ivan. As a voyeur,

478
00:44:19,177 --> 00:44:21,873
you've kept photos of those
you have victimized.

479
00:44:22,914 --> 00:44:24,882
- Let me go!
- Can you see the pain

480
00:44:24,949 --> 00:44:26,917
you have brought them?

481
00:44:26,984 --> 00:44:29,179
You have torn apart their lives.

482
00:44:29,253 --> 00:44:32,950
You have used your body
as an instrument of abuse.

483
00:44:33,024 --> 00:44:35,356
Now I give you the chance
to decide

484
00:44:35,426 --> 00:44:38,395
what is more important...

485
00:44:38,463 --> 00:44:41,830
your eyes which have led you
blindly astray

486
00:44:41,899 --> 00:44:44,197
or your body

487
00:44:44,268 --> 00:44:46,236
which has caused those around you

488
00:44:46,304 --> 00:44:48,704
endless suffering.

489
00:44:48,773 --> 00:44:51,833
You have been handed the tools
which can save your life.

490
00:44:51,909 --> 00:44:54,707
Decide quickly, though.
In 60 seconds

491
00:44:54,779 --> 00:44:58,476
the choice will be made for you.

492
00:45:10,361 --> 00:45:12,727
I can do it. One more.
I can do it.

493
00:45:42,727 --> 00:45:44,695
You're gonna have to tell me
how you got

494
00:45:44,762 --> 00:45:48,198
those bruises on your hand
and your neck.

495
00:45:49,267 --> 00:45:52,964
Was this an accident or did someone
do this to you on purpose?

496
00:45:53,037 --> 00:45:57,167
You can stop it from happening
if you tell me the truth.

497
00:45:58,276 --> 00:46:00,540
Take a seat, please.

498
00:46:00,611 --> 00:46:02,306
I want to go home now.

499
00:46:07,652 --> 00:46:09,483
The son of a bitch is lying.

500
00:46:09,554 --> 00:46:12,387
He's done this before.
She's allowing it.

501
00:46:12,456 --> 00:46:15,948
The child's story doesn't corroborate.
What can I do?

502
00:46:16,027 --> 00:46:18,461
Jane, I can't let you go home
right now, okay?

503
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:20,292
Go back to class, honey.

504
00:46:20,364 --> 00:46:22,491
I told you, Officers,
sometimes these kids...

505
00:46:22,567 --> 00:46:24,660
they just get out of control.

506
00:46:24,735 --> 00:46:26,703
- Get your hands off me!
- Hey, take it easy.

507
00:46:26,771 --> 00:46:28,568
Rigg! Rigg!

508
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:32,405
No. Get out. Get out now.

509
00:46:32,476 --> 00:46:34,671
You just made the biggest
mistake of your life.

510
00:46:34,745 --> 00:46:36,508
You hear me?
I will take him

511
00:46:36,581 --> 00:46:39,277
for everything he's got,
that fucking cocksucker.

512
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:42,352
That's sweet, Ms. Tuck,

513
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:45,321
but if you love the guy so much,
why leave him?

514
00:46:45,389 --> 00:46:48,051
- He left me long before I left him.
- Okay, people break up.

515
00:46:48,125 --> 00:46:50,252
Relationships end.
It's called life.

516
00:46:50,328 --> 00:46:52,990
I mean, he started
massacring people.

517
00:46:53,064 --> 00:46:55,532
- Gideon meant everything to him.
- Gideon? I'm sorry, who?

518
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,592
Do you know anything
about the Chinese zodiac?

519
00:46:58,669 --> 00:47:00,694
Aw, Jill, no no.

520
00:47:00,771 --> 00:47:02,739
I didn't just get pregnant.

521
00:47:02,807 --> 00:47:04,775
It was carefully planned.

522
00:47:04,842 --> 00:47:07,834
Everything with John was.

523
00:47:10,715 --> 00:47:12,239
- Thanks.
- See you.

524
00:47:12,316 --> 00:47:14,284
- Bye-bye.
- Bye. Let me get that for you.

525
00:47:14,352 --> 00:47:17,048
Thank you.

526
00:47:17,121 --> 00:47:19,282
- Thanks. Have a good night.
- You too.

527
00:47:19,357 --> 00:47:20,949
- Good night.
- Good night.

528
00:47:25,663 --> 00:47:28,359
Hey, honey,
you want some company?

529
00:47:28,432 --> 00:47:31,060
What are you doing?

530
00:47:31,135 --> 00:47:33,103
You know what this building is?

531
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,504
It's a health clinic.

532
00:47:38,576 --> 00:47:41,477
You're a beautiful girl.
Go home.

533
00:47:48,085 --> 00:47:49,916
My jacket.
I forgot my jacket.

534
00:47:49,987 --> 00:47:51,955
- I forgot my jacket.
- Cecil, no.

535
00:47:52,023 --> 00:47:53,718
Oh, please please, Jill.
It's right there.

536
00:47:53,791 --> 00:47:57,192
Look, it's right there.
Please please. Come on.

537
00:47:58,229 --> 00:48:00,197
Thank you.

538
00:48:08,272 --> 00:48:10,240
Thanks.

539
00:48:12,076 --> 00:48:14,237
Listen to me.
I don't want to hurt you, all right?

540
00:48:14,311 --> 00:48:15,869
You're gonna open up
that fucking door.

541
00:48:15,946 --> 00:48:18,414
Open that fucking door.
Open it.

542
00:48:18,482 --> 00:48:20,780
Open it.

543
00:48:20,851 --> 00:48:23,581
Fuck!
What fucking key?

544
00:48:23,654 --> 00:48:25,781
- What key?
- That one.

545
00:48:25,856 --> 00:48:27,619
Fuck.

546
00:48:29,994 --> 00:48:31,586
Fucking stay there.

547
00:48:34,899 --> 00:48:36,867
Cecil?

548
00:48:55,686 --> 00:48:59,019
Don't cry.
No no, hey, you're gonna be okay.

549
00:49:02,126 --> 00:49:04,094
Fuck.

550
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:18,501
I need some help here.

551
00:49:18,576 --> 00:49:20,635
Orderly.

552
00:49:20,711 --> 00:49:22,440
This is my wife.
She's pregnant.

553
00:49:22,513 --> 00:49:25,311
- How far along is she, sir?
- Seven months.

554
00:50:06,524 --> 00:50:08,924
All I wanted to do was help them.

555
00:50:10,194 --> 00:50:12,662
You can't help them.

556
00:50:13,798 --> 00:50:15,766
They have to help themselves.

557
00:50:26,644 --> 00:50:29,772
Okay, let's review:

558
00:50:29,847 --> 00:50:31,815
Girl loves boy.
Boy loves girl.

559
00:50:31,882 --> 00:50:35,818
Boy gets girl pregnant.
Girl loses baby.

560
00:50:35,886 --> 00:50:39,083
Boy turns into a serial killer.

561
00:50:39,156 --> 00:50:42,284
Jill, I'm not buying it.

562
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:45,454
You're gonna want
to take a look at this.

563
00:50:45,529 --> 00:50:47,497
All right, she doesn't leave.

564
00:50:59,043 --> 00:51:01,807
He's been identified
as Ivan Landsness.

565
00:51:01,879 --> 00:51:03,904
Acquitted of rape three times.

566
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:07,007
Had to gouge out his own eyes
in order to release himself.

567
00:51:08,252 --> 00:51:11,312
How does something like this
get into a motel room undetected?

568
00:51:11,388 --> 00:51:13,356
Piece by piece.

569
00:51:13,424 --> 00:51:15,449
The room's been rented
for the past six days

570
00:51:15,526 --> 00:51:18,825
to a lawyer named Art Blank.
Get this: he went missing two weeks ago.

571
00:51:18,896 --> 00:51:20,591
Run his name.
Get his addresses.

572
00:51:20,664 --> 00:51:24,100
Two out of five people on Officer Rigg's
apartment walls are dead.

573
00:51:24,168 --> 00:51:27,035
Every partner
he's ever worked with... dead.

574
00:51:27,104 --> 00:51:30,403
Rigg didn't kill Ivan.
Ivan made his own choice.

575
00:51:30,474 --> 00:51:32,408
Isn't that the whole Jigsaw mantra?

576
00:51:32,476 --> 00:51:34,273
This wasn't about Ivan.
It wasn't his test.

577
00:51:34,345 --> 00:51:37,280
It was about Rigg.

578
00:51:37,348 --> 00:51:39,441
Look at these photos.
Tell me how you feel.

579
00:51:39,516 --> 00:51:41,313
Look at these women and tell me
how you feel.

580
00:51:41,385 --> 00:51:43,376
- Angry. Enraged.
- Exactly.

581
00:51:43,454 --> 00:51:47,618
The pimp, the rapist...
Jigsaw wanted Rigg to see what he sees.

582
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:51,024
He wants him to feel what he feels.

583
00:51:51,095 --> 00:51:53,461
This wasn't about Rigg
saving his friends.

584
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:56,294
He's being recruited.

585
00:51:56,367 --> 00:51:59,336
Thanks. Art Blank's got
a bunch of properties.

586
00:51:59,403 --> 00:52:01,769
Last known address
is a couple of blocks from here.

587
00:52:08,279 --> 00:52:11,339
- Right side clear.
- Left side clear.

588
00:52:11,415 --> 00:52:13,144
- Clear.
- Clear.

589
00:52:13,217 --> 00:52:15,185
Clear.

590
00:52:34,338 --> 00:52:36,738
What does this mean?

591
00:52:36,807 --> 00:52:39,605
We're the two Jigsaw targets.

592
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:55,358
Fuck you.

593
00:53:00,531 --> 00:53:02,465
Hey.

594
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,492
Hey. Hey.

595
00:53:22,553 --> 00:53:25,351
Hey, asshole,
you jump off that block,

596
00:53:25,422 --> 00:53:26,946
you electrocute him.

597
00:53:27,024 --> 00:53:30,482
If that ice had melted more,
he'd be fried. You understand?

598
00:53:30,561 --> 00:53:32,529
Listen to him.

599
00:53:41,572 --> 00:53:43,699
You just made the biggest
mistake of your life,

600
00:53:43,774 --> 00:53:45,071
- cocksucker!
- Calm down.

601
00:53:45,142 --> 00:53:47,201
We'll get somebody to take
a look at it, all right?

602
00:53:47,277 --> 00:53:50,508
My client has a broken nose
and a fractured cheekbone.

603
00:53:50,581 --> 00:53:54,278
Administrative leave with pay
is not acceptable.

604
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:57,985
The IA investigation is underway.

605
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:02,018
Into this precinct? Wow.
What's that gonna get me, huh?

606
00:54:02,092 --> 00:54:04,287
- The truth.
- I'll tell you what the truth is.

607
00:54:04,361 --> 00:54:06,921
The truth is,
I have an eyewitness.

608
00:54:06,997 --> 00:54:09,625
The man's wife? She stands to gain
as much as he does

609
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,668
if there were to be
a financial settlement,

610
00:54:11,735 --> 00:54:13,396
which is not gonna happen
because he's lying.

611
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:15,438
He attacked Officer Rigg first.

612
00:54:15,506 --> 00:54:17,474
That's according to whom?

613
00:54:17,541 --> 00:54:19,907
Me. I saw the whole thing.

614
00:54:21,078 --> 00:54:23,171
You want to testify
before the grand jury?

615
00:54:23,247 --> 00:54:26,546
I've already signed IA's affidavit.
The charges are being dismissed.

616
00:54:26,617 --> 00:54:28,847
Oh, you guys are... you're good.

617
00:54:28,919 --> 00:54:31,888
You know, you're obviously as thick
as thieves in this precinct.

618
00:54:31,955 --> 00:54:34,253
But it'll come back to you.
You know that, right?

619
00:54:34,324 --> 00:54:37,020
I mean, one day someday it will.
It will come back to you.

620
00:54:45,235 --> 00:54:47,203
You understand?

621
00:54:47,271 --> 00:54:48,795
Motherfucker.

622
00:54:48,872 --> 00:54:51,102
Hey, do you understand?

623
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:56,270
Okay.

624
00:55:01,485 --> 00:55:03,248
Motherfucker.

625
00:55:18,602 --> 00:55:20,593
You're gonna have to tell me
how you got

626
00:55:20,671 --> 00:55:23,970
those bruises on your hand
and your neck.

627
00:56:15,192 --> 00:56:17,285
Rigg! Rigg!

628
00:56:39,049 --> 00:56:42,314
I did it! I won!

629
00:56:42,386 --> 00:56:44,013
What the hell did you do?

630
00:56:44,087 --> 00:56:46,351
I...

631
00:56:54,898 --> 00:56:56,866
What's happening?

632
00:57:00,571 --> 00:57:03,233
The human body is
a fascinating organism.

633
00:57:03,307 --> 00:57:05,537
It can withstand
the most brutal injury...

634
00:57:06,577 --> 00:57:09,671
and yet repair itself miraculously.

635
00:57:09,746 --> 00:57:11,714
But you know this all too well.

636
00:57:11,782 --> 00:57:13,773
How many broken bones
have you suffered

637
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:16,478
at the hands of your husband?

638
00:57:16,553 --> 00:57:19,283
How many flesh wounds
have you endured?

639
00:57:19,356 --> 00:57:20,618
Help!

640
00:57:20,691 --> 00:57:24,559
With time, the bruises have healed,
but your pain has not.

641
00:57:27,464 --> 00:57:31,560
Today I empower you
to take control of your life.

642
00:57:31,635 --> 00:57:33,694
Can you disconnect
from the one thing

643
00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:36,534
that has brought you and others
so much pain?

644
00:57:36,607 --> 00:57:39,041
With time your wounds will heal.

645
00:57:40,811 --> 00:57:42,802
His, however, will not.

646
00:57:47,284 --> 00:57:50,082
Remove the ties that bind...

647
00:57:50,153 --> 00:57:51,279
Get me out of here!

648
00:57:51,355 --> 00:57:53,585
...or bleed to death
from you inactivity.

649
00:57:53,657 --> 00:57:55,625
The choice is yours.

650
00:57:55,692 --> 00:57:58,422
Okay.
Okay okay!

651
00:57:58,495 --> 00:57:59,826
Here we go.

652
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:06,325
I'm sorry.

653
00:58:09,873 --> 00:58:12,637
Morgan, Morgan,
what the fuck are you doing?

654
00:58:45,042 --> 00:58:48,273
Help me.
Please help me. I can't do this.

655
00:58:48,345 --> 00:58:50,438
- Please help me!
- Calm down.

656
00:58:50,514 --> 00:58:52,641
No, don't go. Don't go.
Don't go. Wait for me.

657
00:58:52,716 --> 00:58:54,707
Please get me out.
Please get me out.

658
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:57,379
Don't. Don't go. Don't leave me here.

659
00:58:57,454 --> 00:59:00,355
Help me down.

660
00:59:00,424 --> 00:59:03,393
Hello, Officer Rigg.
What have you learned thus far?

661
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:05,792
Experience is a harsh teacher.

662
00:59:05,862 --> 00:59:07,853
First comes the test.

663
00:59:07,931 --> 00:59:10,627
Second comes the lesson.

664
00:59:10,701 --> 00:59:13,169
If you are to save as I save

665
00:59:13,236 --> 00:59:16,034
then you will see
that the person before you

666
00:59:16,106 --> 00:59:17,664
is but a student.

667
00:59:17,741 --> 00:59:20,471
So I ask you, Officer Rigg,

668
00:59:20,544 --> 00:59:22,512
has the pupil learned her lesson?

669
00:59:22,579 --> 00:59:26,015
Has she been taught
the error of her ways?

670
00:59:26,083 --> 00:59:27,778
Does she now

671
00:59:27,851 --> 00:59:29,842
- view the world differently?
- Please help.

672
00:59:31,088 --> 00:59:34,319
Officer Rigg,
the key to this person's freedom

673
00:59:34,391 --> 00:59:37,224
lies in the palm of your hand.

674
00:59:37,294 --> 00:59:39,694
But only after she has done
her own part

675
00:59:39,763 --> 00:59:43,290
can you play your role
in her salvation.

676
00:59:43,367 --> 00:59:45,665
Once judgment has been made,
though,

677
00:59:45,736 --> 00:59:48,398
the key to finding
your next destination

678
00:59:48,472 --> 00:59:50,838
is just off the map.

679
00:59:50,907 --> 00:59:54,001
- Who did this to you?
- I don't know.

680
00:59:55,579 --> 00:59:57,342
Help, please.
Help, please.

681
00:59:57,414 --> 00:59:59,541
Stay still.
I'm gonna try to take this out.

682
01:00:11,762 --> 01:00:12,956
Thank you.
Thank you.

683
01:00:13,029 --> 01:00:14,997
Oh, fuck.

684
01:00:16,099 --> 01:00:18,795
That's it.
"Just off the map."

685
01:00:18,869 --> 01:00:20,837
Just off the map.

686
01:00:22,105 --> 01:00:24,733
Tracy.

687
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:28,141
"Go home."

688
01:00:31,014 --> 01:00:32,709
Where is she?

689
01:00:32,783 --> 01:00:35,479
I'm so cold. Please.

690
01:00:42,793 --> 01:00:44,761
I want to live.

691
01:00:48,698 --> 01:00:50,666
You have to save yourself.

692
01:00:54,671 --> 01:00:56,434
Don't leave me.
Please don't leave.

693
01:00:56,506 --> 01:00:58,531
Help me, please.
Don't leave.

694
01:01:03,547 --> 01:01:05,640
I want to stop playing.

695
01:01:09,453 --> 01:01:11,580
Why don't you fucking kill me?

696
01:01:11,655 --> 01:01:13,486
No.

697
01:01:15,859 --> 01:01:19,522
- Shut up!
- I don't want to play anymore.

698
01:01:22,098 --> 01:01:24,066
"Save as I save."

699
01:01:24,134 --> 01:01:26,261
So what did he do,
free her and let him die?

700
01:01:26,336 --> 01:01:28,497
This guy didn't have a chance.
He's got rods going through

701
01:01:28,572 --> 01:01:31,268
every major artery in his body.
"Your life is in her hands."

702
01:01:31,341 --> 01:01:33,309
Rigg didn't kill this guy.
His wife did.

703
01:01:33,376 --> 01:01:36,311
She identified Officer Rigg,
said he saved her.

704
01:01:36,379 --> 01:01:38,040
- Saved?
- Yeah.

705
01:01:38,114 --> 01:01:40,674
She passed Rigg's judgment,
got fixed and got her freedom back.

706
01:01:45,021 --> 01:01:47,353
- Yeah.
- Second address?

707
01:01:49,726 --> 01:01:52,524
Really? Okay, yeah.
That's good. Good.

708
01:01:52,596 --> 01:01:54,894
But I still need that address.
Text me.

709
01:01:54,965 --> 01:01:58,196
I just found out something interesting
about the three people in the traps.

710
01:01:58,268 --> 01:02:01,669
They were all represented by a lawyer
named Art Blank.

711
01:02:01,738 --> 01:02:03,968
- He got them all off?
- Yeah. But wait, it gets better.

712
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,473
He's also Jill Tuck's lawyer.

713
01:02:06,843 --> 01:02:08,743
Look out!

714
01:02:12,849 --> 01:02:15,909
- The lair... where's the lair?
- Raided. It doesn't exist.

715
01:02:15,986 --> 01:02:18,546
Jigsaw wanted us to find that place.
Where's the new game being played?

716
01:02:18,622 --> 01:02:20,055
We find that place... we find Rigg.

717
01:02:20,123 --> 01:02:22,489
We got a second address.
There's a co-owner.

718
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:23,890
- Who?
- Jill Tuck.

719
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,758
- Jill Tuck? Where's the building?
- Here. This building.

720
01:03:35,932 --> 01:03:37,661
Hello, Agent Perez.

721
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:41,568
And welcome to the world
that you have long studied.

722
01:03:41,638 --> 01:03:43,469
Your partner Agent Strahm

723
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:47,169
will soon take the life
of an innocent man.

724
01:03:47,243 --> 01:03:49,734
Heed my warning, Agent Perez.

725
01:03:49,813 --> 01:03:52,976
Your next move is critical.

726
01:03:53,049 --> 01:03:55,017
Open the door...

727
01:03:57,787 --> 01:03:59,755
What is that?

728
01:04:11,368 --> 01:04:13,336
I got you.

729
01:04:17,707 --> 01:04:19,504
Paramedics!

730
01:04:19,576 --> 01:04:21,476
Help!

731
01:04:22,846 --> 01:04:25,178
Stay with me.
Okay, come on.

732
01:04:25,248 --> 01:04:27,216
Shallow breaths. Come on.

733
01:04:27,283 --> 01:04:28,807
Stay with me. All right.

734
01:04:28,885 --> 01:04:31,285
All right. You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.

735
01:05:02,585 --> 01:05:04,416
Hey.

736
01:05:05,455 --> 01:05:07,423
Hey, you. Come here.

737
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:09,048
Look.

738
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:11,958
Hey. Hey.

739
01:05:12,028 --> 01:05:13,655
Come on.

740
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:16,597
Hey. Hey.

741
01:05:17,901 --> 01:05:19,334
Fuck.

742
01:05:24,441 --> 01:05:26,602
- Stop. Stop.
- Son of a bitch!

743
01:05:26,676 --> 01:05:28,439
Fuck.

744
01:05:31,147 --> 01:05:33,479
Stop. Fuck.

745
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:35,347
Hey.

746
01:05:35,418 --> 01:05:38,046
Listen to me. I'm not the one
you've got to worry about.

747
01:05:38,121 --> 01:05:40,919
You understand me? I'm not
the one you've got to worry about,

748
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:43,117
asshole.

749
01:05:43,193 --> 01:05:46,526
As a matter of fact,
I recommend you stay alive

750
01:05:46,596 --> 01:05:50,088
until the fucking clock
counts down.

751
01:05:51,267 --> 01:05:55,169
Here's the good news:
If this other guy passes his test,

752
01:05:55,238 --> 01:05:58,435
the three of us can go free.

753
01:05:58,508 --> 01:06:00,373
Hey, look at me.

754
01:06:00,443 --> 01:06:02,274
Look at me.

755
01:06:02,345 --> 01:06:05,439
If you don't stay on the block,
your partner gets electrocuted.

756
01:06:05,515 --> 01:06:07,779
Now for my final task.

757
01:06:09,753 --> 01:06:12,119
There you go.

758
01:06:13,256 --> 01:06:15,156
Live or die.

759
01:06:15,225 --> 01:06:16,988
You make the choice.

760
01:06:18,328 --> 01:06:20,762
Mrs. Perez?

761
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:24,527
Hi. This is Peter Strahm.
I work with your daughter Lindsay.

762
01:06:24,601 --> 01:06:27,627
Yeah.
I have some bad news.

763
01:07:05,008 --> 01:07:08,034
See that, Jill? That's a federal fucking
indictment. It's got your name on it.

764
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:11,205
Wanna put somebody else's name on it?
You start talking to me, okay?

765
01:07:11,281 --> 01:07:12,976
What's with the doll?
What's with the tricycle?

766
01:07:13,049 --> 01:07:15,347
Who were John's business associates
before he went insane?

767
01:07:15,418 --> 01:07:17,511
He wasn't the associate type.

768
01:07:18,555 --> 01:07:20,489
Where the hell is Art Blank?

769
01:07:20,557 --> 01:07:22,650
Obstruction of justice.
Aiding and abetting.

770
01:07:22,725 --> 01:07:24,989
Conspirator to murder.

771
01:07:25,061 --> 01:07:26,392
Talk to me!

772
01:07:26,462 --> 01:07:29,488
In 15 minutes, more people
are gonna die, Jill... police officers.

773
01:07:29,566 --> 01:07:31,329
He's a business partner.
He's a friend.

774
01:07:31,401 --> 01:07:33,596
He's the accomplice
we have been looking for

775
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:35,399
and he is your fucking lawyer.

776
01:07:37,674 --> 01:07:40,768
You see this?
This is my partner's blood.

777
01:07:40,844 --> 01:07:43,210
She's fighting for her life right now

778
01:07:43,279 --> 01:07:46,373
because of your lunatic husband.

779
01:07:46,449 --> 01:07:49,179
What happened between Jigsaw
and Art Blank?

780
01:07:49,252 --> 01:07:51,220
John?

781
01:07:53,489 --> 01:07:55,457
John.

782
01:07:57,026 --> 01:07:58,994
I guess he's not here either.

783
01:07:59,062 --> 01:08:02,429
What the fuck is this place, Jill?

784
01:08:08,204 --> 01:08:10,399
- Don't be mad.
- What?

785
01:08:14,043 --> 01:08:16,568
Hey, are you all right?

786
01:08:16,646 --> 01:08:20,514
You weren't returning
my calls, buddy.

787
01:08:20,583 --> 01:08:24,383
Listen, John, I...

788
01:08:24,454 --> 01:08:26,422
I'm sorry.
I understand.

789
01:08:26,489 --> 01:08:29,390
What happened was a tragedy.

790
01:08:29,459 --> 01:08:32,087
But I gotta tell you...

791
01:08:32,161 --> 01:08:34,595
listen, John, I gotta tell you,
those buildings we're working on...

792
01:08:34,664 --> 01:08:36,632
You take 'em.
You give my share to Jill.

793
01:08:36,699 --> 01:08:39,759
That's not the way it works, John.
You see, we're partners.

794
01:08:39,836 --> 01:08:42,270
Your designs will make
those buildings special.

795
01:08:42,338 --> 01:08:44,806
We've got 40 families ready to move in...
40 families, John,

796
01:08:44,874 --> 01:08:47,069
low-income families.

797
01:08:47,143 --> 01:08:48,872
You can't just walk away.

798
01:08:48,945 --> 01:08:50,913
You're their savior, John.

799
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:53,039
Get the fuck out of here.

800
01:08:53,116 --> 01:08:55,311
Who are you talking to like that?
It's me, John.

801
01:08:55,385 --> 01:08:58,115
- Did you hear what I said?
- Oh, I heard you, John.

802
01:09:01,591 --> 01:09:03,559
Get the fuck...

803
01:09:05,561 --> 01:09:07,222
You heard me.

804
01:09:10,066 --> 01:09:13,763
Okay, John.
You take good care of yourself.

805
01:09:15,305 --> 01:09:17,830
Gimme a call
when you're feeling better.

806
01:09:36,659 --> 01:09:38,593
He blamed me.

807
01:09:38,661 --> 01:09:41,255
I don't think he could
ever forgive me.

808
01:09:41,331 --> 01:09:43,799
In his mind
our time was over.

809
01:09:45,068 --> 01:09:47,434
He was diagnosed with cancer
soon after that.

810
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:00,212
Did you try to contact him again?

811
01:10:00,283 --> 01:10:01,978
I tried.

812
01:10:03,186 --> 01:10:05,654
But a different person
crawled out of the wreckage.

813
01:10:05,722 --> 01:10:08,054
Someone else survived.

814
01:10:39,589 --> 01:10:41,420
- I asked you not to come here.
- I need to talk to you.

815
01:10:41,491 --> 01:10:43,459
John, John,

816
01:10:43,526 --> 01:10:46,723
look at this.
What is this, hmm?

817
01:10:46,796 --> 01:10:48,764
Why do you have Cecil's picture?

818
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,799
What have you done to him?

819
01:10:50,867 --> 01:10:55,395
I told him not to take life
for granted.

820
01:10:55,471 --> 01:10:57,439
I want to play a game.

821
01:10:57,507 --> 01:11:00,533
Your life is a lie.

822
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:02,578
Now comes your moment of truth.

823
01:11:02,645 --> 01:11:04,613
As a drug user and a hustler,

824
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:08,013
you've played roulette
with other people's lives.

825
01:11:08,084 --> 01:11:10,279
Today you play with your own.

826
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:16,018
Fuck.

827
01:12:20,823 --> 01:12:22,848
Fuck!

828
01:12:28,164 --> 01:12:30,132
Hey, it's you.

829
01:12:30,199 --> 01:12:31,757
You did this to me.

830
01:12:31,834 --> 01:12:34,803
No, you did this to yourself.

831
01:12:36,205 --> 01:12:38,571
Your greed took the life
of an innocent child.

832
01:12:38,641 --> 01:12:41,667
Could you give me time
to explain, please?

833
01:12:41,744 --> 01:12:44,338
I can't give you time.
No one can.

834
01:12:44,413 --> 01:12:45,903
Time's an illusion.

835
01:12:45,982 --> 01:12:49,213
Look, look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

836
01:12:49,285 --> 01:12:51,310
I forgive you, Cecil. I do.

837
01:12:51,387 --> 01:12:53,184
Addiction has ruined your life.

838
01:12:53,256 --> 01:12:54,951
I'm bleeding, man.

839
01:12:55,024 --> 01:12:57,492
Please just let me go.

840
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,687
I could let you go.

841
01:12:59,762 --> 01:13:02,663
That wouldn't serve you.

842
01:13:02,732 --> 01:13:06,759
I'll tell you what I will do, though.
I'll give you a tool

843
01:13:06,836 --> 01:13:09,805
to reclaim your life,

844
01:13:09,872 --> 01:13:13,069
to discard the vices that have
so corrupted your soul.

845
01:13:13,142 --> 01:13:15,110
I don't have a fucking soul.

846
01:13:15,178 --> 01:13:17,169
Maybe you will in the next life, Cecil.

847
01:13:17,246 --> 01:13:19,544
You see, things aren't sequential.

848
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:22,243
Good doesn't lead to good,
nor bad to bad.

849
01:13:22,318 --> 01:13:24,013
People steal,
don't get caught,

850
01:13:24,086 --> 01:13:26,054
live the good life.

851
01:13:26,122 --> 01:13:28,181
Others lie, cheat

852
01:13:28,257 --> 01:13:30,191
and get elected.

853
01:13:30,259 --> 01:13:32,887
Some people stop
to help a stranded motorist

854
01:13:32,962 --> 01:13:36,659
and get taken out
by a speeding semi.

855
01:13:36,732 --> 01:13:39,098
There's no accounting for it.

856
01:13:39,168 --> 01:13:42,433
How you play the cards you're dealt...
that's all that matters.

857
01:13:42,505 --> 01:13:44,837
Look at me.

858
01:13:44,907 --> 01:13:46,738
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

859
01:13:46,809 --> 01:13:49,471
Oh, yeah.

860
01:13:49,545 --> 01:13:51,672
I understand.

861
01:13:53,015 --> 01:13:54,915
You're fucking nuts!

862
01:14:08,397 --> 01:14:11,423
Whoa! What the fuck is that?

863
01:14:12,868 --> 01:14:14,631
It's the tool...

864
01:14:14,704 --> 01:14:16,604
the tool that's going to
save your life.

865
01:14:17,907 --> 01:14:19,499
I want to play a game.

866
01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:23,335
Your life is a lie, Cecil.

867
01:14:24,413 --> 01:14:26,643
Now comes your moment of truth.

868
01:14:26,716 --> 01:14:29,651
As a drug addict and a thief,

869
01:14:29,719 --> 01:14:31,880
you've preyed on the kindness
of others

870
01:14:31,954 --> 01:14:33,945
to fuel your addiction.

871
01:14:34,023 --> 01:14:36,355
Today we're bringing

872
01:14:36,425 --> 01:14:39,019
the ugliness inside you
out into the open.

873
01:14:39,095 --> 01:14:41,222
Now in order for you
to stay alive

874
01:14:41,297 --> 01:14:43,765
we have to match your face

875
01:14:43,833 --> 01:14:46,631
with the ugliness of your soul.

876
01:14:48,004 --> 01:14:52,304
Just lean forward into the knives
with your face.

877
01:14:52,375 --> 01:14:54,605
Press hard enough

878
01:14:54,677 --> 01:14:57,703
and you'll release
the arm and the leg restraints

879
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:00,214
that bind you.

880
01:15:00,283 --> 01:15:02,274
Press hard, though.

881
01:15:03,719 --> 01:15:05,448
And you'll be free.

882
01:15:05,521 --> 01:15:08,251
You sick fuck! Fuck you!

883
01:15:08,324 --> 01:15:13,261
Or you can sit idly
and bleed out on the floor.

884
01:15:14,297 --> 01:15:16,595
Live or die, Cecil.

885
01:15:16,666 --> 01:15:18,634
Make your choice.

886
01:15:28,544 --> 01:15:30,876
Fuck you, you sick fuck!

887
01:15:30,946 --> 01:15:32,504
Help!

888
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:25,699
You're dead.

889
01:16:25,768 --> 01:16:28,396
You're fucking dead.

890
01:16:29,905 --> 01:16:32,032
Fucking dead.

891
01:16:45,621 --> 01:16:47,589
What's happened to you?

892
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:52,627
What's happened to me?

893
01:16:52,695 --> 01:16:54,526
What's happened
to me?

894
01:17:03,139 --> 01:17:05,164
Now you don't come back.

895
01:17:06,742 --> 01:17:08,972
You do it for yourself
if you can't do it for me.

896
01:17:10,479 --> 01:17:12,447
I lost him too.

897
01:17:48,284 --> 01:17:50,684
"Four Walls Build a Home."

898
01:17:58,994 --> 01:18:01,258
Your son was named
after John's first building, right?

899
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:03,628
- Yes.
- Where is it?

900
01:18:03,699 --> 01:18:06,259
Where is it?
Where is it?

901
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:08,895
Where is it?

902
01:18:29,558 --> 01:18:31,082
What the fuck does that mean?

903
01:19:24,647 --> 01:19:28,708
Fuck. Oh, fuck.

904
01:19:32,087 --> 01:19:34,248
You'd better hope he doesn't
come through that door.

905
01:19:34,323 --> 01:19:37,417
Who? Who's coming
through the door?

906
01:19:41,931 --> 01:19:44,331
Who is it?

907
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:19,497
Where the fuck are you?

908
01:20:19,568 --> 01:20:23,231
Gideon Meat Packing,
11235 Blake Drive.

909
01:20:23,305 --> 01:20:25,273
I don't have two minutes.

910
01:21:26,769 --> 01:21:29,203
Who's coming through the door?

911
01:21:40,616 --> 01:21:42,584
Fuck.

912
01:22:02,071 --> 01:22:04,164
Congratulations, Art.

913
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:40,304
Who is it?

914
01:22:43,312 --> 01:22:45,803
Who's coming through the door?

915
01:22:45,881 --> 01:22:48,441
Here he comes.

916
01:22:48,517 --> 01:22:49,643
Who the fuck is it?

917
01:22:51,153 --> 01:22:53,986
Shit.

918
01:22:56,992 --> 01:22:58,789
Shit.

919
01:23:00,763 --> 01:23:03,163
Fix me, motherfucker!

920
01:23:05,601 --> 01:23:08,434
I'm standing right here.

921
01:23:09,705 --> 01:23:12,196
Your time's running out.

922
01:23:12,274 --> 01:23:14,299
Please think about
what you're doing.

923
01:23:17,713 --> 01:23:21,706
Think about
what you promised me.

924
01:23:21,784 --> 01:23:23,251
Think about tomorrow.

925
01:23:23,318 --> 01:23:25,286
Lynn?

926
01:23:27,089 --> 01:23:30,058
Lynn! Lynn!

927
01:23:39,001 --> 01:23:40,969
Who is it?

928
01:23:50,445 --> 01:23:52,572
What is that?

929
01:23:52,648 --> 01:23:55,640
This will release us
when the timer's up.

930
01:24:00,055 --> 01:24:02,421
Release me!

931
01:24:07,162 --> 01:24:09,130
Which is it gonna be, Jeff?

932
01:24:09,198 --> 01:24:11,166
Live or die, Jeff.

933
01:24:11,233 --> 01:24:13,326
You've got a choice.

934
01:24:13,402 --> 01:24:15,097
I forgive you.

935
01:24:16,138 --> 01:24:18,106
Jeff.

936
01:24:18,173 --> 01:24:20,141
Jeff!

937
01:24:24,446 --> 01:24:26,346
- Eric!
- Don't open the door!

938
01:24:26,415 --> 01:24:28,280
What the fuck?

939
01:24:30,552 --> 01:24:31,780
Shit.

940
01:25:11,927 --> 01:25:14,225
"Open the door and you will find me."

941
01:25:26,174 --> 01:25:28,972
- Let me see your fucking hands.
- Where is my daughter, you mother...?

942
01:25:31,346 --> 01:25:32,506
Fuck.

943
01:25:40,856 --> 01:25:42,983
Jesus.

944
01:25:54,136 --> 01:25:57,128
- Fuck!
- Aw, you stupid motherfucker.

945
01:25:57,205 --> 01:25:59,230
- What did you do?
- I had more time.

946
01:25:59,308 --> 01:26:02,937
- I still had fucking time.
- Why did you open that door?

947
01:26:03,011 --> 01:26:04,706
- You fucking did this!
- No, you idiot.

948
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:08,841
No, Jigsaw's testing you,
you fucking piece of shit.

949
01:26:08,917 --> 01:26:11,511
Put your fucking hands
where I can see them!

950
01:26:11,586 --> 01:26:13,850
- Jigsaw's fucking testing you.
- Don't fucking move!

951
01:26:17,793 --> 01:26:19,590
Hello, Officer Rigg.

952
01:26:19,661 --> 01:26:22,289
If you are hearing this,
then you have reached

953
01:26:22,364 --> 01:26:25,162
Detective Matthews
and Detective Hoffman

954
01:26:25,233 --> 01:26:27,701
in under 90 minutes,

955
01:26:27,769 --> 01:26:29,862
resulting in their deaths.

956
01:26:29,938 --> 01:26:32,133
The rules were clear.

957
01:26:32,207 --> 01:26:34,072
You were warned.

958
01:26:34,142 --> 01:26:35,871
- It's Kerry!
- Do not go through that door.

959
01:26:35,944 --> 01:26:38,879
You know never to go
through an unsecured door, ever.

960
01:26:40,048 --> 01:26:42,380
Tonight you face your obsession.

961
01:26:42,451 --> 01:26:45,215
What you can't do
is save everyone.

962
01:26:45,287 --> 01:26:47,312
Will you learn how to let go?

963
01:26:48,357 --> 01:26:50,917
- Eric is still out there, man.
- It's time to let go.

964
01:26:50,993 --> 01:26:53,461
Detective Matthews has
but 90 minutes.

965
01:26:53,528 --> 01:26:55,792
I recommend you stay alive

966
01:26:55,864 --> 01:26:57,957
until the fucking clock
counts down.

967
01:26:58,033 --> 01:27:00,024
They had to save themselves.

968
01:27:01,069 --> 01:27:02,866
Take 'em.

969
01:27:05,007 --> 01:27:08,636
Their salvation was
out of your hands.

970
01:27:08,710 --> 01:27:10,678
Time was on your side,

971
01:27:10,746 --> 01:27:13,442
but your obsession
wouldn't let you wait.

972
01:27:13,515 --> 01:27:16,382
Instead of saving
Detective Matthews,

973
01:27:16,451 --> 01:27:18,419
you cost him his life.

974
01:27:18,487 --> 01:27:20,614
You failed your final test.

975
01:27:28,363 --> 01:27:31,389
What I don't understand is
how the hell could Jigsaw do all this?

976
01:27:31,466 --> 01:27:33,400
He was damn near on his deathbed
the last time we saw him.

977
01:27:33,468 --> 01:27:35,436
I'm not so sure he did.

978
01:27:42,110 --> 01:27:44,374
- This wasn't done by Amanda Young.
- Excuse me?

979
01:27:44,446 --> 01:27:46,437
- She couldn't get her up there alone.
- John Kramer was...

980
01:27:46,515 --> 01:27:48,244
He's brains, not brawn.

981
01:27:48,316 --> 01:27:51,251
We're here to find the person
helping Jigsaw and Amanda Young.

982
01:28:01,496 --> 01:28:03,726
Looks like another doctor
went missing from the hospital.

983
01:28:07,803 --> 01:28:09,065
You go home.

984
01:28:12,074 --> 01:28:13,666
We chose this.

985
01:28:30,959 --> 01:28:32,927
Game over.

986
01:29:00,956 --> 01:29:03,288
You feel you now have control,
don't you?

987
01:29:05,393 --> 01:29:07,987
You think you will
walk away untested?

988
01:29:15,337 --> 01:29:18,773
I promise that my work
will continue.

989
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:21,968
That I have ensured.

990
01:29:22,043 --> 01:29:24,375
By hearing this tape
some will assume

991
01:29:24,446 --> 01:29:26,243
that this is over.

992
01:29:26,314 --> 01:29:29,647
But I am still among you.

993
01:29:29,718 --> 01:29:32,983
You think it's over
just because I am dead?

994
01:29:33,054 --> 01:29:36,854
It's not over.
The games have just begun.

995
01:31:36,855 --> 01:31:37,855

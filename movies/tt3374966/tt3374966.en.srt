2
00:01:07,885 --> 00:01:10,387
[ARTURO] Do you see that girl?
She's called Flora.

3
00:01:10,512 --> 00:01:14,016
To me the most beautiful girl
in the world.

4
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:17,269
I have loved her since we were kids...

5
00:01:17,352 --> 00:01:19,396
...that's about twenty years.

6
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,107
Each day Flora passes this old house.

7
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,985
Here there lived a judge I knew.

8
00:01:25,027 --> 00:01:29,364
He was the only one who knew
what I felt for her...

9
00:01:29,406 --> 00:01:32,367
...because I never had
the courage to declare...

10
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:36,038
or rather... I never had
the chance. Why?

11
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:38,123
Because we are in Palermo.

12
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:41,668
And here the mafia has always
affected the lives of all...

13
00:01:41,793 --> 00:01:43,754
...especially mine.

14
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:50,010
It all began on the evening
10 December 1969...

15
00:01:50,052 --> 00:01:54,931
...when my father and my mother
moved into their new love nest.

16
00:01:55,057 --> 00:01:58,685
Transported by passion, they
immediately decided to conceive.

17
00:02:02,814 --> 00:02:07,402
But my parents could not
know what was going to happen.

18
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:13,659
At that precise moment in fact
some men dressed as policemen...

19
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,202
...but not actually being policemen...

20
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:17,788
...went to a meeting,
without being invited.

21
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:25,087
They were headed to an office that was
in the same building as my parents...

22
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:26,963
Viale Lazio 1... 08.

23
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,841
They wanted to surprise
Mr. Michele Cavataio...

24
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:32,552
a known mafia boss...
known as "The Cobra".

25
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,682
So at least we give a fuck about them!

26
00:02:38,975 --> 00:02:42,104
[ARTURO] This nice party was composed of...

27
00:02:42,187 --> 00:02:45,607
...D'Agostino, Provenzano,
Caruso, Bagarella and Degree...

28
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,362
...the only one in civilian clothes because
he did not want to die dressed as a cop.

29
00:02:54,825 --> 00:02:58,370
The organizer of this unexpected
courtesy visit...

30
00:02:58,495 --> 00:03:02,082
...was the future head of the Cosa Nostra,
Mr. Toto Riina...

31
00:03:02,124 --> 00:03:05,252
affectionately known
by his friends as "the beast".

32
00:03:06,711 --> 00:03:10,507
So while my fathers sperm
ran towards the goal...

33
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,845
Toto Riina's... men entered
the last tunnel to Palermo.

34
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:18,974
[GROANS]

35
00:03:26,898 --> 00:03:29,985
[ARTURO] Together they arrived at
their respective destinations:

36
00:03:30,026 --> 00:03:31,611
Sperm to the egg...

37
00:03:31,653 --> 00:03:34,614
...and the fake cops to the front
of the office of Cavataio...

38
00:03:34,656 --> 00:03:37,868
...just below the love nest
of my parents.

39
00:03:41,163 --> 00:03:42,747
[PROVENZANO] stop! Police!

40
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,877
[ARTURO] And it is precisely
at this moment...

41
00:03:46,918 --> 00:03:50,297
...that my life intersects
for the first time with the Mafia.

42
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,317
[SCREAMING]

43
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,831
But only one sperm,
arriving very late...

44
00:04:24,873 --> 00:04:27,334
not having heard all that noise...

45
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:31,838
...threw himself headfirst inside the
egg and fertilized.

46
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,009
The sperm was me.

47
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:41,014
If Toto Riina had not organized
the "Viale Lazio massacre"...

48
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:43,975
...I would never have been conceived.

49
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,521
[MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND]

50
00:05:27,435 --> 00:05:30,897
[ARTURO] My baptism was
the shortest in the history of Palermo.

51
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:33,191
I baptize you in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

52
00:05:33,274 --> 00:05:36,277
May God bless you.
Congratulations, many blessings!

53
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,072
Thank you, goodbye.
Excuse me, have patience.

54
00:05:39,197 --> 00:05:43,576
[ARTURO] That day Giacinto,
the spiritual father of our family...

55
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,578
could not miss another baptism.

56
00:05:45,662 --> 00:05:47,539
Congratulations!

57
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:54,921
[ARTURO] One of the first junta headed
by Christian Democrat Vito Ciancimino Mayor...

58
00:05:54,963 --> 00:05:58,091
considered by many in
the scent of the Mafia.

59
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:03,221
Perhaps it was because of those
friendships...

60
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:07,475
that... 10 years later police found him
dead with 5 bullets in his body...

61
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:12,063
in his luxurious apartment...
in the convent of Santa Maria de Jesus

62
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,941
At the crime scene
the investigators found:

63
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:17,235
Five million euros in cash...

64
00:06:17,318 --> 00:06:19,320
a 38 caliber pistol...

65
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:22,991
a collection of leather objects..

66
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:26,244
...commonly called "whips".

67
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:28,621
Mom.

68
00:06:28,705 --> 00:06:31,499
Mom... mom!

69
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,378
Arturo... Mom!

70
00:06:35,503 --> 00:06:39,382
Maria Pia, the statue of Garibaldi
gives more satisfaction!

71
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,885
[ARTURO] My parents were
wrong to worry...

72
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,597
I did not speak because..
I didn't have the right stimulus.

73
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:48,141
Mom! Dad!

74
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:51,394
But one day a stimulus arrived!

75
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:54,355
Bless this house in the name
the Father, the Son...

76
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:57,108
...the Holy Spirit, Amen.

77
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,736
And bless you too
this beautiful "bambino"!

78
00:06:59,777 --> 00:07:03,281
Giacinto, this "bambino"
gives us concern.

79
00:07:03,364 --> 00:07:07,744
We try to make him talk, but nothing!

80
00:07:07,785 --> 00:07:09,787
This is not a defect!

81
00:07:09,871 --> 00:07:13,666
Where I come from we say:
Who speaks little says more.

82
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:18,546
Bravo, bambino!
Praised be Jesus Christ.

83
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,549
- Always be praised!
- Always be praised!

84
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,177
- I'll see you out, Father.
- Dont worry.

85
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,889
See you.

86
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:33,561
Ma... fia.

87
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,943
He said "mafia"?

88
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:52,038
Look! Say hello to your little brother.

89
00:07:57,168 --> 00:08:00,964
Bella! Gioiuzza it's Dad!

90
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:05,969
- Who is he?
- Come on.

91
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:11,724
What is it, Arturo?

92
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:16,229
- That man is scary!
- Why be scared!

93
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:18,898
He's just a happy dad
because his child was born.

94
00:08:19,023 --> 00:08:23,778
One who behaves so must have a big heart.

95
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,905
Come on.

96
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:33,121
Its Daddy!

97
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:39,252
[ARTURO] Growing up I began to understand
in Palermo that nothing is as it seems.

98
00:08:39,293 --> 00:08:42,505
Here he says that the Mafia killed
Marshal Attilio Bonincontro.

99
00:08:42,547 --> 00:08:46,008
Always - the Mafia, The Mafia!
They talk bullshit.

100
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,803
According to me it's all
a matter of females!

101
00:08:50,054 --> 00:08:54,308
[RADIO] Brigadier Filadelfio Aparo
was killed today in Palermo.

102
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:57,145
Intelligence sources
talk about a mafia motive.

103
00:08:57,186 --> 00:08:59,439
The Mafia always the Mafia!

104
00:08:59,564 --> 00:09:02,275
A person who knew him said
he had upset...

105
00:09:02,316 --> 00:09:05,194
a female...
that he shouldn't have upset.

106
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:10,533
Journalist Mario Francese
was killed in Palermo.

107
00:09:10,575 --> 00:09:13,953
Francese was good, though he liked
the skirts a bit too much...

108
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:16,289
those of others...!

109
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,792
Boy, You need to know one thing:

110
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:23,045
More are killed in Palermo
by females than heart attacks.

111
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:32,096
- Arturo?
- What is it?

112
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,433
Dad always fights with mom,
they shout bad things...

113
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,935
- Good! Good!
- Why good?

114
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:41,814
- Daddy told me.
- I have discovered one thing.

115
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:46,444
In Palermo, the men who fall in love
with women are killed!

116
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,739
So could she kill my father?

117
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:52,325
- Your father loves your mother?
- He says no.

118
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:53,868
Then you are safe.

119
00:09:53,951 --> 00:09:56,829
- Silence you two!
- Excuse me, excuse me.

120
00:09:57,955 --> 00:10:01,125
[ARTURO] Palermo
was a city full of pitfalls...

121
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:04,086
...it was wise to pay attention.

122
00:10:04,128 --> 00:10:06,506
- Good morning, Mr. Chinn!
- Thank you.

123
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:14,764
One day I discovered
that I was in danger.

124
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,974
Arturo, wake up! Come on!

125
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,854
Today we have a new classmate.

126
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:25,107
She is called Flora Guarneri,
Say hello Flora.

127
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:29,028
- [ALL] Hello, Flora!
- Today you sit in the front row.

128
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:31,030
- Arturo.
- What is it?

129
00:10:31,155 --> 00:10:33,032
Have you seen the new girl?

130
00:10:36,244 --> 00:10:37,912
But you, you do not like her?

131
00:10:50,758 --> 00:10:52,426
Who did you see?

132
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:02,436
[ARTURO] Yes, I was in love.

133
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:06,065
I was caught up in
the frightening issue of females.

134
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,150
And I was not the only one.

135
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:12,446
At that moment the mafia boss Filippo
Marquis had the same problem.

136
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:25,084
She has stolen my eyes!
I'm lost in love.

137
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:27,670
Philip, you can not marry her.

138
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:30,423
It is against the rules of
the Cosa Nostra.

139
00:11:30,464 --> 00:11:33,050
She is the daughter of divorced parents.

140
00:11:35,678 --> 00:11:37,430
But there is a solution!

141
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:41,434
I have an idea if you want to hear...

142
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:43,978
Come on then..

143
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:48,816
Kill her father so she
will no longer be a divorced daughter...

144
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:50,735
...but an orphan.

145
00:11:52,236 --> 00:11:54,822
It's a beautiful idea.

146
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:58,200
See - everything falls into place?

147
00:11:58,242 --> 00:12:00,494
All you need is common sense!

148
00:12:01,996 --> 00:12:03,873
Arturo, what are you saying?

149
00:12:03,998 --> 00:12:06,625
Murder is a serious matter.

150
00:12:08,252 --> 00:12:10,838
One is killed
because he says too much...

151
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,633
...because he does not fulfill agreements,
because of mistakes.

152
00:12:16,051 --> 00:12:18,053
But not for a girl.

153
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:21,182
Do you know what the philosopher said?

154
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:25,561
"The creature returns to the creator."

155
00:12:28,063 --> 00:12:31,942
Go to your Flora
before she takes someone else.

156
00:12:32,026 --> 00:12:34,570
- Thank you.
- Life is like that.

157
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:38,157
Who is a fool if he stays at home.

158
00:12:45,456 --> 00:12:47,082
Dad?

159
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,712
- I wanted to ask you something.
- Tell me, Arturo.

160
00:12:55,424 --> 00:12:58,427
How did you tell mama
that you were in love?

161
00:13:02,223 --> 00:13:04,308
How did I tell her?

162
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,685
I just told her...

163
00:13:06,727 --> 00:13:08,354
and... that's it.

164
00:13:08,437 --> 00:13:11,440
This is nature.

165
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:14,693
- What about nature?
- Arturo, we will talk about it later.

166
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:17,321
Now silence because
Costanzo is starting.

167
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,742
You should watch it yourself
this is interesting.

168
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:26,121
[COSTANZO] Guest tonight:
Mr Giulio Andreotti.

169
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:29,750
I would like to ask a personal question
if I may, Mr. President.

170
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:35,005
Do you remember how and when
you said to your wife: Let's get married?

171
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:38,259
[ANDREOTTI] Now you go
quite personal...

172
00:13:38,342 --> 00:13:40,886
It is also quite a funny story.

173
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,890
- Your wife is watching tonight?
- I think so.

174
00:13:44,974 --> 00:13:47,226
I'll have to front up to her
when I get home.

175
00:13:47,268 --> 00:13:53,232
I think that rarely has
there has been a proposal...

176
00:13:55,025 --> 00:13:57,736
made in the cemetery.

177
00:13:57,778 --> 00:14:01,782
I said: "Now is the time I tell you."
- At the cemetery!

178
00:14:01,865 --> 00:14:07,121
So it was not random.
No. It may seem odd...

179
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:09,039
well... maybe it is...

180
00:14:09,123 --> 00:14:12,376
As the conversation started
I was very self-conscious...

181
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,004
because I had little experience.

182
00:14:15,045 --> 00:14:19,925
[ARTURO] It was evident that Andreotti
was talking to me.

183
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:23,804
Contrary to my father,
he understood my difficulties...

184
00:14:23,887 --> 00:14:25,931
...and decided to help me.

185
00:15:07,931 --> 00:15:14,188
Also this year we will organize
the carnival...

186
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:17,941
We will have a costume party,
are you happy?

187
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,235
- [ALL] Yes!
- Well done!

188
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,489
- You, how will you dress?
- As Prince Charming.

189
00:15:23,572 --> 00:15:26,617
- And you, Sebastian?
- A cowboy!

190
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:28,494
Arturo?

191
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,751
[CHILD] Jump, jump, jump!

192
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,259
Guys, look.

193
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:53,727
But what are you? A turtle?

194
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:57,272
- I think it's Dracula!
- But no, guys, come on!

195
00:15:57,397 --> 00:15:59,274
He's Don Chuck - the beaver!

196
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:02,611
Of course!

197
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:12,955
The people often wrong,
except in the voting booth.

198
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,846
Sebastian!

199
00:16:30,722 --> 00:16:32,599
What are you doing?

200
00:16:33,934 --> 00:16:35,811
Do it like this...

201
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:38,480
You have to hear the noise.

202
00:16:38,605 --> 00:16:40,566
Pum! Pum! Pum!

203
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,741
Children, come here!

204
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:54,121
Now then...

205
00:16:54,204 --> 00:16:57,582
The time has come to award
the best costume.

206
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:01,128
The winner of first prize...

207
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:03,505
...for the best costume...

208
00:17:04,381 --> 00:17:08,760
Arturo Giammarresi, dressed
as the Hunchback of Notre Dame.

209
00:17:08,844 --> 00:17:10,846
A big round of applause!

210
00:17:12,514 --> 00:17:14,266
Where is Arturo?

211
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:16,226
Arturo!

212
00:17:17,144 --> 00:17:19,271
Find him, right?

213
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:26,028
I am not the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
I'm not the tortoise man...

214
00:17:26,153 --> 00:17:28,155
nor Don Chuck - the beaver.

215
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,783
I am the Chairman of the Board
Giulio Andreotti.

216
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:38,498
LAUGHING

217
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:46,131
What's so funny?

218
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,678
Andreotti is a decent person,
I knew him personally.

219
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:54,431
And he is our
Chairman of the Board.

220
00:17:55,515 --> 00:17:57,684
Does the President have anything
to say to a princess?

221
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:03,065
- Well... I wanted to ask...
- What do you want to ask?

222
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,317
Want to come with me to the cemetery?

223
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:09,821
- To the cemetery?
- Yes, to the cemetery.

224
00:18:09,905 --> 00:18:11,823
Flora, come on!

225
00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:15,202
Sorry, I have to go now.

226
00:18:15,285 --> 00:18:17,954
Fofo's parents are waiting for me. Bye!

227
00:18:25,087 --> 00:18:27,089
You were dressed as Lancelot.

228
00:18:28,465 --> 00:18:31,426
[ARTURO] That day the decision
to dress as Giulio Andreotti...

229
00:18:31,468 --> 00:18:33,470
disturbed... not only my father...

230
00:18:33,553 --> 00:18:36,431
but also Mafia bosses..
Leoluca Bagarella and Toto Riina.

231
00:18:36,473 --> 00:18:38,850
Look who's here!
The son of Andreotti.

232
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,560
The son of Andreotti?

233
00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:45,607
- He looks like his father.
- It's true!

234
00:18:45,732 --> 00:18:48,693
Totע, you would like
to meet Andreotti?

235
00:18:48,735 --> 00:18:52,113
Sure, but he only meets
his friends in Palermo.

236
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,950
I have to explain I am the
boss of Palermo today.

237
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:56,493
Come on!

238
00:19:07,754 --> 00:19:10,257
- Sebastian...
- What is it?

239
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,343
Is there is something between
Fofo and Flora?

240
00:19:14,469 --> 00:19:18,890
Fofo boasts that she goes to study
every afternoon at his home.

241
00:19:19,015 --> 00:19:22,227
- Every?
- Every Every.

242
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:25,021
- Are you jealous?
- No.

243
00:19:38,785 --> 00:19:41,496
It is not nice to spy on
peoples houses.

244
00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:44,541
- Excuse me.
- What is your name?

245
00:19:44,624 --> 00:19:49,045
- Arturo. Please don't tell her.
- Who? - Flora.

246
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:50,797
Ah, Flora!

247
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,133
The daughter of Mr. Guarneri.

248
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,928
Dont worry, it remains a secret
between us.

249
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,321
Stop, idiot!

250
00:20:15,363 --> 00:20:17,449
That perfume!

251
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:22,245
- What do you want, Arturo?
- Emanuele scribbled on Andreotti.

252
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,247
- Can I get cuttings from granddad's house?
- No.

253
00:20:24,372 --> 00:20:27,375
- But he doesn't need them he's dead!
- I said no!

254
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,130
Want me to cook?

255
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:34,507
Go away...

256
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:39,346
[TV] See that white laundry!

257
00:20:39,387 --> 00:20:44,142
But I say white! This dazzling!

258
00:20:44,225 --> 00:20:49,272
And what wonderful gifts with
the figurines in the collection.

259
00:21:15,423 --> 00:21:17,258
Go.

260
00:21:19,052 --> 00:21:21,054
Good morning.

261
00:21:30,563 --> 00:21:34,442
The iris are good but messy.

262
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,570
You know them?

263
00:21:37,695 --> 00:21:41,449
A Palermo, who does not know the iris
with the ricotta baked in the oven!

264
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,452
Here we have to fix it.
Give me an iris, please?

265
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:49,916
There you are, sir.

266
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,293
Taste.

267
00:21:56,339 --> 00:21:59,342
Feel the chocolate chips that
are mixed with ricotta cheese?

268
00:22:00,677 --> 00:22:02,720
Like this? Bravo!

269
00:22:03,596 --> 00:22:07,308
Remember, only here can you
eat the iris.

270
00:22:10,353 --> 00:22:13,356
Arturo, you want to eat that
at recess?

271
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:44,596
That one.

272
00:22:47,515 --> 00:22:50,393
- Do you know who gives you these things?
- No.

273
00:23:10,163 --> 00:23:12,248
- Fofo.
- Yes?

274
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,751
Did you give me this?

275
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:18,546
- Yes.
- Thank you.

276
00:23:31,267 --> 00:23:33,061
[ARTURO] I could not give up.

277
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:36,314
I had to find a way to unmask Fofo...

278
00:23:36,439 --> 00:23:39,400
Andreotti came to the rescue again.

279
00:23:41,027 --> 00:23:45,573
I had to take an iris to Flora,
this time without hiding.

280
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:54,582
- Arturo, come here!
- Stop, you can not pass.

281
00:24:02,215 --> 00:24:05,843
- Who is it inspector?
- It's Boris Julian.

282
00:24:05,968 --> 00:24:08,221
They ruined the feast.

283
00:24:29,158 --> 00:24:31,869
- Flora, I have to tell you something.
- Tell me.

284
00:24:31,911 --> 00:24:35,123
Fofo is a liar.
I bought you the iris.

285
00:24:35,164 --> 00:24:38,417
And why isnt there one on my
desk this morning?

286
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:41,170
You cant eat iris anymore.

287
00:24:41,295 --> 00:24:44,924
Inside there are bullets that killed a man.

288
00:24:45,007 --> 00:24:48,010
- Really?
- I saved your life.

289
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:50,138
Thank you!

290
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:52,431
Flora, here is your iris today.

291
00:24:54,684 --> 00:24:57,562
Liar, I'm not coming with
you to the cemetery.

292
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:09,157
[ARTURO] After the murder of Giuliano in
Palermo everything changed.

293
00:25:09,198 --> 00:25:11,951
We saw people dying every day.

294
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:15,788
Toto Riina had decided
to conquer our city...

295
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,458
And to take it...
he was ready to exterminate all...

296
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,460
Also the rival gangs.

297
00:25:25,673 --> 00:25:29,468
For the first time the bosses of
Palermo were afraid.

298
00:25:29,552 --> 00:25:33,055
[TV] This is yet another murder
that has consumed the city...

299
00:25:33,097 --> 00:25:38,603
According to investigators... there could be
war between rival factions of the Mafia.

300
00:25:38,686 --> 00:25:42,690
Many bosses have left Palermo to
escape from possible attacks...

301
00:25:42,732 --> 00:25:46,068
They seek safer havens..
And there is the fear...

302
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,321
...that this clash is only the start

303
00:25:48,362 --> 00:25:51,490
...the list of victims
is likely to increase.

304
00:25:51,574 --> 00:25:53,618
[MUSIC FROM TV]

305
00:26:35,242 --> 00:26:38,120
Flora! Flora!

306
00:26:48,172 --> 00:26:50,883
- Flora, I have to tell you something.
- Were listening.

307
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:53,427
- I saw a mob boss.
- A friend of my father...

308
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,805
said mafia bosses do not exist.

309
00:26:55,888 --> 00:26:58,265
- He knows, he is a lawyer.
- See?

310
00:26:58,307 --> 00:27:01,394
I know where there is one, he is hiding
in my grandfathers house.

311
00:27:01,435 --> 00:27:05,064
- I do not believe you, you're lying.
- I'm not a liar!

312
00:27:05,147 --> 00:27:08,150
- Come, I'll show you.
- Okay.

We'll go tomorrow.

314
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,572
But he is not invited.

00:27:28,838 --> 00:27:30,423
Good night.

318
00:27:30,464 --> 00:27:32,216
- Papa.
- Eh?

319
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:37,555
- Is the Mafia dangerous?
- No, it's like with dogs.

320
00:27:37,596 --> 00:27:40,099
Just do not give them trouble.

321
00:27:40,182 --> 00:27:42,309
I have read they kill people.

322
00:27:42,351 --> 00:27:44,562
Things they write...

323
00:27:45,229 --> 00:27:49,358
- They might kill us?
- Arturo, quiet.

324
00:27:50,734 --> 00:27:54,071
Now we are in winter...
the mafia kills in summer only.

325
00:27:54,113 --> 00:27:55,865
Sleep time.

326
00:28:01,704 --> 00:28:03,372
Dad.

327
00:28:05,207 --> 00:28:08,377
- Yes Arturo.
- Thank you for the poster.

328
00:28:10,838 --> 00:28:12,756
You are welcome.

329
00:28:12,923 --> 00:28:14,842
Now switch off.

330
00:28:18,053 --> 00:28:19,972
- Ciao!
- Ciao, Flora!

331
00:28:20,055 --> 00:28:23,809
Yesterday a friend of mine told me...

332
00:28:23,893 --> 00:28:26,645
...he would take me to a mafia boss.

333
00:28:26,687 --> 00:28:32,067
Remember the address of
the boss and then tell me.

334
00:28:32,943 --> 00:28:35,070
Judge Chinnici, good morning.

335
00:28:35,154 --> 00:28:37,531
Show me your hand.

336
00:28:37,573 --> 00:28:39,909
No, show me the right hand.

337
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:46,457
Is friend called Arturo?

338
00:28:46,582 --> 00:28:50,920
- Yes, and how do you know?
- Judges know everything.

339
00:28:57,468 --> 00:28:59,178
Come on.

340
00:29:03,223 --> 00:29:05,851
- He lives here?
- Quiet, no one must hear us!

341
00:29:05,935 --> 00:29:07,686
You must see!

342
00:29:12,358 --> 00:29:14,068
Come on!

343
00:29:21,325 --> 00:29:23,369
- Come on!
- Quietly!

344
00:29:30,876 --> 00:29:33,379
- Here is where the boss eats.
- Really?

345
00:29:33,504 --> 00:29:36,632
Whats in the rest of the house?

346
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,767
And who are you?

347
00:29:48,727 --> 00:29:51,897
- You are Arturo?
- Yes, he is Arturo.

348
00:29:55,526 --> 00:29:57,903
Did you cut out these photos?

349
00:29:59,238 --> 00:30:00,781
Yes, it was him.

350
00:30:02,991 --> 00:30:05,160
Why do you care so much about Andreotti?

351
00:30:06,537 --> 00:30:08,872
You are not a mafia boss?

352
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:12,418
No, I'm a journalist.

353
00:30:12,543 --> 00:30:16,422
- Are you are hiding in this house?
- No.

354
00:30:16,547 --> 00:30:19,299
It's rented, with a regular contract.

355
00:30:21,385 --> 00:30:24,888
Fofo was right, you're lying again.

356
00:30:33,397 --> 00:30:35,816
[ARTURO] After the foolish
mafia boss story...

357
00:30:35,941 --> 00:30:38,068
...Flora saw me as less than zero.

358
00:30:38,193 --> 00:30:42,531
I began to envy my friends who fell
in love all the time.

359
00:30:43,699 --> 00:30:45,826
That beautiful Gemelline!

360
00:30:48,704 --> 00:30:50,789
Children...

361
00:30:50,831 --> 00:30:53,917
Today... we have a special guest.

362
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:56,920
Flora's father, Dr. Guarneri.

363
00:30:56,962 --> 00:31:00,466
- Pay attention.
- Good morning, guys.

364
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:03,427
In addition to being Flora's father...

365
00:31:03,469 --> 00:31:06,472
I head the bank of Trinacria Palermo...

366
00:31:06,555 --> 00:31:09,933
...and this year we decided to fund
a competition for schools...

367
00:31:09,975 --> 00:31:12,186
...which is called "journalist for a month".

368
00:31:12,227 --> 00:31:16,356
Each participant will compose a theme
on our city...

369
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:18,483
...Titled "A Day in Palermo".

370
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:25,824
The winner will have the honor of writing
for a month for "The Journal of Palermo".

371
00:31:25,866 --> 00:31:28,577
So now it's up to you.

372
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:30,495
Get busy.

373
00:31:52,726 --> 00:31:55,854
[ARTURO] on the 15 June last year for
the promotion...

374
00:31:55,896 --> 00:31:59,358
...I convinced my father I would
give a story on Giulio Andreotti.

375
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:01,235
There were many people.

376
00:32:01,276 --> 00:32:04,529
The first to speak was a dear friend...

377
00:32:04,613 --> 00:32:08,617
...or at least he identified
himself as Mr Salvo Lima...

378
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:11,787
...he only said: "Sicily needs Europe..."

379
00:32:11,912 --> 00:32:13,997
"...and that Europe needs Sicily."

380
00:32:14,081 --> 00:32:17,250
And on behalf of the
authorities behind me...

381
00:32:17,334 --> 00:32:21,171
...a special thank you also goes to
Doctor Guarneri...

382
00:32:21,338 --> 00:32:23,507
It's my manager, you recognize him?

383
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:29,429
...funder of this initiative of which
I am really proud!

384
00:32:30,472 --> 00:32:34,726
Now is the most important
moment of this day.

385
00:32:35,602 --> 00:32:41,233
I have the honor to announce the winner
of our competition.

386
00:32:45,612 --> 00:32:50,492
The award goes to Arturo Giammarresi!

387
00:32:51,827 --> 00:32:53,620
Go! Go!

388
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:56,748
Come Arturo.

389
00:32:57,999 --> 00:33:04,840
And now, Arturo will read
us his beautiful theme.

390
00:33:04,881 --> 00:33:06,758
Next, read!

391
00:33:06,883 --> 00:33:10,262
Director sorry, they killed Pio La Torre.

392
00:33:10,387 --> 00:33:12,514
They killed Pio La Torre.

393
00:33:15,892 --> 00:33:18,353
- "A Day in Palermo."
- Sorry...

394
00:33:18,395 --> 00:33:22,399
We have some very serious news, we have
to suspend the ceremony.

395
00:33:22,482 --> 00:33:25,152
We congratulate the winner...

396
00:33:26,903 --> 00:33:31,241
and we wish him a happy career.
Thanks to all participants.

397
00:33:31,283 --> 00:33:33,243
Excuse me.

398
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:43,545
[TV] The car of the regional secretary
of the PCI - Pio La Torre...

399
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:48,633
...he was flanked by a
killer who fired on him...

400
00:33:48,675 --> 00:33:53,180
...and his driver Misalvo Rosario, 46,
in a barrage of machine gun fire.

401
00:33:53,263 --> 00:33:56,057
Death was instant for both.

402
00:33:56,141 --> 00:34:00,187
This heinous crime is on the eve of the
arrival to Palermo...

403
00:34:00,312 --> 00:34:02,689
...of General Carlo Alberto Della Chiesa...

404
00:34:02,772 --> 00:34:08,195
...who has been appointed to deal with
the resurgence of the Mafia in Sicily.

405
00:34:08,278 --> 00:34:10,822
"Then Giulio Andreotti spoke."

406
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:16,077
You liked the Andreotti meeting?

407
00:34:18,163 --> 00:34:20,290
"The whole crowd cheered."

408
00:34:20,332 --> 00:34:23,793
"You see that is a person
who helps many people."

409
00:34:25,462 --> 00:34:29,966
"In fact, someone said that Giulio
Andreotti is more than a friend..."

410
00:34:30,091 --> 00:34:34,221
"...he is actually the friend of friends."

411
00:34:36,932 --> 00:34:41,102
"I decided when I grow up,
I will be the friend of friends..."

412
00:34:41,186 --> 00:34:44,564
"...so a lot of people will wish me well."

413
00:34:49,611 --> 00:34:50,987
Bravo!

414
00:34:52,197 --> 00:34:55,116
So you want to grow up to be a journalist?

415
00:34:56,201 --> 00:34:58,620
You know that a journalist
does not take applause...

416
00:34:58,745 --> 00:35:01,206
...has no friends among friends...

417
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,083
Is considered a nuisance...

418
00:35:03,124 --> 00:35:05,126
and... there is always someone who
complains about your articles?

419
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:09,631
- But he can write whatever he wants.
- No, this is the problem.

420
00:35:11,216 --> 00:35:14,344
Sometimes you are forced
to write what they want.

421
00:35:14,386 --> 00:35:18,014
If you don't, they send you to cover
Sports like myself.

422
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:20,892
- Do you like sports?
- No, it sucks.

423
00:35:23,979 --> 00:35:29,025
So it takes tenacity, endurance, fortitude.

424
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,529
Do you have that?

425
00:35:33,989 --> 00:35:36,032
- Yes.
- Oh! Bravo!

426
00:35:36,116 --> 00:35:39,661
A good journalist is
judged by the interviews.

427
00:35:39,744 --> 00:35:43,790
Who would you like to interview?
The janitor? The teacher?

428
00:35:46,042 --> 00:35:47,293
No.

429
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:53,925
[ARTURO] To impress Flora decided to focus
on the man of the moment.

430
00:35:54,009 --> 00:35:58,930
It was said that this person would
solve all our problems.

431
00:35:59,014 --> 00:36:03,560
- Boy, where are you going?
- To interview Della Chiesa.

432
00:36:07,188 --> 00:36:09,399
Go home we have work to do.

433
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,908
- And who are you?
- I'm Arturo Giammarresi...

434
00:37:00,033 --> 00:37:02,368
The reporter for a month for
"The Journal of Palermo."

435
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:05,622
- I'm here to interview you.
- What an honor!

436
00:37:05,663 --> 00:37:07,540
Come.

437
00:37:07,665 --> 00:37:09,626
Sit down.

438
00:37:16,049 --> 00:37:18,009
Thank you.

439
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:22,931
What has he come to ask -
this important journalist?

440
00:37:23,056 --> 00:37:26,392
I recommend, however, no tough questions.

441
00:37:28,186 --> 00:37:29,812
First question...

442
00:37:29,896 --> 00:37:32,899
...you are here to fight the Mafia...

443
00:37:32,941 --> 00:37:35,401
but Mr Andreotti says...

444
00:37:35,443 --> 00:37:39,572
the real emergency is crime in
Campania and Calabria.

445
00:37:39,656 --> 00:37:42,075
Maybe he has the wrong region?

446
00:37:46,454 --> 00:37:51,918
[ARTURO] The general says he is fighting
a war against the Mafia.

447
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,171
But to fight a war takes an army...

448
00:37:55,213 --> 00:37:58,049
...and there was no one around him.

449
00:37:58,091 --> 00:38:01,552
There were only two policemen without hats.

450
00:38:01,594 --> 00:38:03,721
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

451
00:38:04,973 --> 00:38:07,725
So maybe Mr Andreotti is right...

452
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:11,062
in Sicily obviously there is nothing to do.

453
00:38:12,313 --> 00:38:14,107
Bravo, Arturo.

454
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,818
You will have a great
future as a journalist.

455
00:38:18,569 --> 00:38:20,697
Fofo?

456
00:38:20,738 --> 00:38:25,618
My fathers driver, saw in a parked car...

457
00:38:25,702 --> 00:38:30,873
...the severed head of
a man with sunglasses.

458
00:38:30,999 --> 00:38:34,335
A severed head with sunglasses...
that's cool!

459
00:38:34,377 --> 00:38:37,255
The rest of the body was in the trunk.

460
00:38:37,338 --> 00:38:39,257
Yes, I saw it.

461
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:41,634
[APPLAUSE]

462
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,762
Okay, guys.

463
00:38:44,887 --> 00:38:47,348
Happy holidays, see you in September.

464
00:38:52,395 --> 00:38:55,773
[ARTURO] Flora was becoming
an impossible love.

465
00:38:55,857 --> 00:38:59,277
Boss Leoluca Bagarella
had it worse than me...

466
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,904
Tosami Lady! Tosami Lady!

467
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:04,282
What an amazing singer!

468
00:39:04,365 --> 00:39:07,035
- My Sugar!
- What the fuck are you doing here?

469
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,371
You should not have killed the beast
who had no money?

470
00:39:10,413 --> 00:39:14,417
Toto, I cant do anything
Spain makes my blood too hot!

471
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,377
Luchino, take me seriously.

472
00:39:16,419 --> 00:39:20,798
Fulfill your commitments
and then you go to Spain!

473
00:39:21,674 --> 00:39:23,176
Alright.

474
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:31,309
[ARTURO] That was the last day of
school before the summer holidays.

475
00:39:31,392 --> 00:39:34,312
I would not see Flora for

630
00:54:50,768 --> 00:54:53,771
Welcome to the show from Palermo!

631
00:54:53,896 --> 00:54:58,860
We have a letter from one of our
affectionate viewers.

632
00:54:58,901 --> 00:55:02,613
Ms. Santoro writes of a
problem that plagues...

633
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,866
...this... our beautiful city...

634
00:55:04,907 --> 00:55:09,245
The problem... the sirens
of the judges cars.

635
00:55:09,287 --> 00:55:12,290
The lady cant follow our program...

636
00:55:12,415 --> 00:55:14,667
...because of these sirens!

637
00:55:14,792 --> 00:55:21,174
The question: Why don't the judges
go and live outside Palermo...

638
00:55:21,299 --> 00:55:24,385
...in a terrace next to one another?

639
00:55:24,427 --> 00:55:28,431
There would be less risk for them
and less risk for us.

640
00:55:28,556 --> 00:55:30,558
Less stress for everyone!

641
00:55:31,309 --> 00:55:36,939
To answer this question, a special guest...

642
00:55:37,023 --> 00:55:41,319
...the noble father of the Christian
Democrats Sicily...

643
00:55:41,402 --> 00:55:45,072
...personal friend of our beloved
Chairman of the Board...

644
00:55:45,156 --> 00:55:48,576
Mr Giulio Andreotti... greetings.
Hello, President!

645
00:55:48,659 --> 00:55:52,079
Is here with us tonight...
[ARTURO] This was my moment.

646
00:55:52,163 --> 00:55:56,584
- I could be wrong.
- Mr Salvo Lima!

647
00:55:56,667 --> 00:55:59,712
Good evening, sir.

648
00:56:01,797 --> 00:56:03,341
- Good evening.
- Take a seat.

649
00:56:03,466 --> 00:56:05,968
[ARTURO] Instead I stumbled.

650
00:56:06,052 --> 00:56:08,221
It's not that I didn't remember
what to play...

651
00:56:08,346 --> 00:56:12,183
I never imagined on the
night of my debut...

652
00:56:12,225 --> 00:56:15,603
...Flora - My Flora!

653
00:56:15,686 --> 00:56:17,563
Arturo.

654
00:56:18,606 --> 00:56:20,483
Arturo!

655
00:56:22,193 --> 00:56:28,032
Greetings to our wonderful musician
for tonight "thats enough"!

656
00:56:28,157 --> 00:56:30,159
Oh, Arturo!

657
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,371
[APPLAUSE]

658
00:56:35,998 --> 00:56:37,875
Go!

659
00:56:38,751 --> 00:56:42,296
Sir, sorry for this little mishap.

660
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:46,300
[LIMA] Thank you for inviting me to
this wonderful transmission.

661
00:56:46,425 --> 00:56:49,387
[JAMPIER] I would ask you every day to
my house for lunch and dinner!

662
00:56:50,429 --> 00:56:53,015
That increased my stress!

663
00:56:53,057 --> 00:56:55,393
I feel terrible.

664
00:56:57,144 --> 00:56:58,938
Here he is.

665
00:56:59,021 --> 00:57:03,442
If we were in the French television
you at this point...

666
00:57:03,526 --> 00:57:05,820
You would have been... "cut"!

667
00:57:05,945 --> 00:57:09,407
- I am mortified, Jampier.
- Dont make that mistake again.

668
00:57:09,448 --> 00:57:14,829
- Otherwise you will be...
- "Cut" - No, kicked out!

669
00:57:17,415 --> 00:57:19,792
Ciao, Flora!

670
00:57:19,834 --> 00:57:21,919
Jampier Sorry, but you know...
it's the adrenaline of the transmission.

671
00:57:21,961 --> 00:57:24,672
He needs to let off steam
and I'm his right arm.

672
00:57:24,714 --> 00:57:28,175
- The help these days.
- [JAMPIER] I'll kick his ass!

673
00:57:33,347 --> 00:57:38,227
- You come back to Palermo often?
- No, I only came back recently.

674
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:39,478
My father asked me...

675
00:57:39,562 --> 00:57:42,606
if I wanted to help Mr Lima
with the election campaign.

676
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:44,608
The policies are sensitive at the moment.

677
00:57:44,692 --> 00:57:48,237
- You are serving an important role?
- I'm his first assistant.

678
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,239
A bit like me and Jampier.

679
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:59,331
- With some differences...
- I also do more tv work.

680
00:57:59,373 --> 00:58:03,252
- I'm a journalist, tour services.
- Interesting!

681
00:58:03,377 --> 00:58:08,132
- Do you also deal with politics?
- I really do not know.

682
00:58:08,257 --> 00:58:13,262
We havent aired anything though I
have many ideas.

683
00:58:13,387 --> 00:58:15,389
Sorry. Flora, come on.

684
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:20,352
- It was nice to see you again. Keep in touch.
- Of course.

685
00:58:20,394 --> 00:58:22,646
- Call me.
- Of course I'll call you.

686
00:58:25,149 --> 00:58:27,776
- I do not have her number...
- Bye, Arturo!

687
00:58:28,402 --> 00:58:30,654
Bye, Flora! I'll call you!

688
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:35,534
[JAMPIER] Certainly, it will be done.
Give my greetings to his honour.

689
00:58:35,659 --> 00:58:37,411
Thank you.

690
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,194
Arturo!

691
00:59:10,277 --> 00:59:13,822
Arturino, I don't know how you did it...

692
00:59:13,906 --> 00:59:17,701
I do not care...
and don't even want to know.

693
00:59:17,826 --> 00:59:22,831
A little while ago I phoned the
personal assistant of Mr Lima...

694
00:59:22,957 --> 00:59:24,959
...Flora Guarneri.

695
00:59:25,042 --> 00:59:27,962
Flora! And as she was?

696
00:59:28,087 --> 00:59:32,299
I'll ask you personally,
do not miss the occasion...

697
00:59:32,341 --> 00:59:37,304
The lady told me that Mr Lima
wants you...

698
00:59:37,346 --> 00:59:41,934
...as a journalist to cover the
election campaign of the DC...

699
00:59:41,976 --> 00:59:43,978
...on behalf of our newscast.

700
00:59:44,103 --> 00:59:49,733
I hope you realize the "delicacy"
of this task!

701
00:59:49,858 --> 00:59:51,860
Of course!

702
00:59:51,986 --> 00:59:55,572
- This time, you cant make mistakes.
- Of course!

703
00:59:55,614 --> 00:59:57,449
Otherwise you will be...

704
00:59:58,325 --> 01:00:00,202
- "Cut"
- How?

705
01:00:00,244 --> 01:00:02,955
Kicked up the ass.

706
01:00:02,997 --> 01:00:04,999
"Exactamente"!

707
01:00:05,124 --> 01:00:08,210
I see that you are starting to learn.

708
01:00:13,382 --> 01:00:17,261
My son has to do a contest.
His honour must lend a hand.

709
01:00:17,386 --> 01:00:21,390
His Honour thinks, there are no problems...

710
01:00:22,683 --> 01:00:24,393
...oh no?

711
01:00:24,518 --> 01:00:26,645
No.

712
01:00:29,773 --> 01:00:32,443
[ARTURO] I had heard rumours about
the Honourable Mr Lima...

713
01:00:32,526 --> 01:00:35,779
but until recently I'd
never before imagined...

714
01:00:35,821 --> 01:00:38,699
...I would find myself in a situation
like this but for the sake of love...

715
01:00:38,782 --> 01:00:41,452
...you make a lot of silly choices.

716
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,833
I'll call later.

717
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,839
Mizzeca, she's nice!

718
01:00:55,466 --> 01:00:57,468
Oh! So what?

719
01:01:01,054 --> 01:01:03,182
- You cant say?
- No.

720
01:01:06,727 --> 01:01:09,104
Fofo Cassina!

721
01:01:09,229 --> 01:01:11,857
- You are?...
- Arturo Giammarresi.

722
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:15,110
- Arturo, how are you?
- Well. What are you doing here?

723
01:01:15,235 --> 01:01:18,614
I knew that Flora is back, so
I wanted to greet her.

724
01:01:18,739 --> 01:01:21,617
You have done well but you don't
know what happened last week!

725
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:25,370
Flora had a fight with Lima
and left, slamming the door.

726
01:01:25,454 --> 01:01:29,374
She shouted: "You wont see me again!
I'm going back to Schaffhausen."

727
01:01:29,458 --> 01:01:32,252
- Schaffhausen?
- It's a German canton.

728
01:01:32,336 --> 01:01:35,214
- The most distant.
- Giammarresi, you can come in.

729
01:01:35,255 --> 01:01:38,008
- Coming. I have to go, Fofo.
- Go.

730
01:01:38,133 --> 01:01:40,844
- Thanks for updating me.
- Go figure!

731
01:01:40,886 --> 01:01:45,516
I'll put them in a vase of water so
they don't die... it would be a shame.

732
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,018
- Thank you.
- Bye, I guess.

733
01:01:54,149 --> 01:01:57,027
There are some corrections to make.

734
01:01:57,110 --> 01:01:59,988
We have already spoken, I
understood everything.

735
01:02:00,989 --> 01:02:02,991
- Flora.
- Sit down.

736
01:02:03,033 --> 01:02:05,035
I understood everything.

737
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:08,914
But I'm busy now, see you this afternoon.

738
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:11,792
Okay, thank you. Goodbye.

739
01:02:13,293 --> 01:02:15,754
I brought you a little token.

740
01:02:15,796 --> 01:02:18,507
I really liked them.

741
01:02:19,383 --> 01:02:24,304
- I also bought you an iris.
- Apart from the iris...

742
01:02:25,389 --> 01:02:27,808
...did you bring any ideas for
the project?

743
01:02:27,891 --> 01:02:31,812
No, because I thought I would confront you.

744
01:02:31,937 --> 01:02:35,691
Any ideas wouldnt hurt,
anyway, I'll be quick.

745
01:02:35,816 --> 01:02:37,901
Mr Lima, despite not being nominated...

746
01:02:37,943 --> 01:02:40,904
...is working for the party in
the general election.

747
01:02:40,946 --> 01:02:42,948
The timing is very delicate.

748
01:02:43,031 --> 01:02:45,450
These services are important to us.

749
01:02:45,534 --> 01:02:49,288
From today you are at our disposal
until the end of the campaign.

750
01:02:49,329 --> 01:02:53,792
If you have a girlfriend, tell her that for
the next two months you're not available.

751
01:02:53,834 --> 01:02:56,837
I want to reassure you that I don't
have a girlfriend.

752
01:02:56,962 --> 01:03:00,340
I havent for years...

753
01:03:00,465 --> 01:03:04,594
- I'm sorry for you.
- But its my choice.

754
01:03:04,678 --> 01:03:08,473
- I'm giving priority to my career.
- You are right.

755
01:03:08,598 --> 01:03:10,809
It seems Jampier didn't
regard you very well.

756
01:03:10,851 --> 01:03:13,729
This is a great opportunity,
I recommended you. I decided...

757
01:03:13,854 --> 01:03:16,231
- Flora...
- Here are all the details.

758
01:03:16,315 --> 01:03:18,608
I'll see you tomorrow at
3pm at Ballaro market.

759
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:22,571
Perfect.

760
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:26,199
Already eaten?

761
01:03:28,493 --> 01:03:29,995
Alright.

762
01:03:35,125 --> 01:03:37,252
- Arturo.
- Si?

763
01:03:38,628 --> 01:03:41,715
There are no bullets inside, I can eat it?

764
01:03:41,757 --> 01:03:45,844
Yes, you can eat it but I bought only two.

765
01:03:45,886 --> 01:03:50,348
- There are a few people, not enough...
- Hello? Good morning.

766
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:52,726
I'm the assistant to Mr..

767
01:03:52,768 --> 01:03:54,853
Sa-sa-sa... Salvo Lima.

768
01:03:54,895 --> 01:03:56,980
Testing Salvo Lima!

769
01:03:57,022 --> 01:03:59,608
The tone is there, maybe the shot...

770
01:04:01,151 --> 01:04:04,654
- Perfect.
- Isnt that Jampiers pianist?

771
01:04:04,738 --> 01:04:08,158
- Yes, that's why I'm playing the piano.
- I have to start the broadcast.

772
01:04:08,241 --> 01:04:11,912
- Can you go away?
- It's him! - Parapapa!

773
01:04:12,037 --> 01:04:14,039
Sorry, I'm working!

774
01:04:14,164 --> 01:04:17,375
You have to break the co...
How are you, beautiful Flora?

775
01:04:17,417 --> 01:04:19,169
- Everything alright?
- Yes.

776
01:04:19,336 --> 01:04:23,924
- His honour is coming.
- Now start the broadcast.

777
01:04:24,049 --> 01:04:26,551
Then follow his honour closely, okay?

778
01:04:26,676 --> 01:04:30,180
Now excuse me, I have to say a warm
goodbye to my fans.

779
01:04:30,347 --> 01:04:32,849
You've missed the cameraman!

780
01:04:35,185 --> 01:04:37,854
Now that I've said goodbye, we can begin.

781
01:04:39,439 --> 01:04:42,484
Sa-sa-sa... Salvo Lima.

782
01:04:42,567 --> 01:04:44,986
Salvo Lima, This...

783
01:04:46,363 --> 01:04:48,615
- Sir, I support you!
- Thank you, thank you.

784
01:04:50,951 --> 01:04:53,495

After meeting with the traders,
the Honourable Lima...

791
01:05:16,142 --> 01:05:20,522
Launched... a plan for solving
the problems of Sicily.

792
01:05:20,647 --> 01:05:25,902
Sicily needs Europe, Europe needs Sicily.

Bravo, Arturo.

We are proud of you.

795

Lima and the Christian
Democrats will never die!

796
01:05:38,665 --> 01:05:41,251
[LIMA] Once again our party...

...during this election campaign.

805
01:06:11,948 --> 01:06:17,287
The Honourable Lima closed the proceedings
with an innovative recipe for Sicily.

806
01:06:17,329 --> 01:06:23,543
Sicily needs Europe and
Europe needs Sicily.

807

The cuckold!

808

He said could sort the
outcome of the maxi trial...

809
01:06:36,181 --> 01:06:38,350
...but all were convicted.

810
01:06:38,475 --> 01:06:42,228
And as we march to jail
Judge Falcone toasts.

811
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:46,441
We need to kill Lima.

812
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:50,987
Those we thought friends, are enemies.

813
01:07:02,874 --> 01:07:06,461
[TV] The judge Giovanni Falcone has
expressed great satisfaction...

814
01:07:06,503 --> 01:07:10,006
...of the supreme courts decision to
confirm all sentences...

815

Hello, Flora. If you need me I'm ready.

No, Arturo. For dinner, you and I alone.

- Of course I do.

I wont bring the camera.

826
01:07:44,165 --> 01:07:47,043
It depends on what ideas you have.

- No, in the living room.

- No, we'll have dinner after.

You would have at least done it once.

- No, I swear.

- I need your help.
- We'll help each other.

843
01:09:20,553 --> 01:09:24,807
- I've never written a speech for a politician.
- Politician?

844
01:09:24,932 --> 01:09:27,310
It's not easy to write a speech for Lima.

845
01:09:28,436 --> 01:09:30,021
Ah, Lima.

846
01:09:30,063 --> 01:09:35,818
It's not that Lima makes
particularly complex speeches.

847
01:09:35,943 --> 01:09:40,198
Sicily needs Europe, Europe needs Sicily.

848
01:09:40,323 --> 01:09:44,285
If you want to change it, you can put
Europe prior to Sicily.

849
01:09:44,327 --> 01:09:47,914
Stop being an idiot!
Listen to me, its important.

850
01:09:47,955 --> 01:09:52,418
Lima wants to deliver a speech, you
know with the controversy there is...

851
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:55,213
I thought to start like this:

852
01:09:55,338 --> 01:09:58,800
"The Christian Democratic Party is in the front
row against the mafia and will fight if..."

853
01:09:58,841 --> 01:10:01,844
The first row seems excessive to me.

854
01:10:01,969 --> 01:10:06,682
I would say the third row because the
second would be an exaggeration.

855
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:10,061
What is it? What is it?

856
01:10:10,103 --> 01:10:13,314
- Why are you so grumpy?
- Flora...

857
01:10:13,356 --> 01:10:17,193
Lima does not say phrases like that,
he never speaks against the Mafia.

858
01:10:17,235 --> 01:10:20,696
He says this now he is on the campaign
trail, for the election?

859
01:10:21,989 --> 01:10:23,950
And those who vote?

860
01:10:27,578 --> 01:10:29,622
This evening I have had a realisation.

861
01:10:30,456 --> 01:10:33,835
I understand who you are,
you're an asshole.

me, you give me a sermon...

Maybe something more.

Is this the real reason?

872
01:11:11,122 --> 01:11:15,042
- Yes.
- So this is the worst way and time to tell me.

873
01:11:16,544 --> 01:11:18,296

943
01:18:12,125 --> 01:18:14,670
You have confused me now too!

944
01:18:14,753 --> 01:18:16,922
Press something its safe.

945
01:18:18,048 --> 01:18:23,428
How does this technology work?
I do not understand...

946
01:18:23,553 --> 01:18:28,558
[TV] The judge Borsellino supported
the candidacy of John Falcone...

947
01:18:28,642 --> 01:18:33,397
[ARTURO] A few days after Riina learnt
how to work a remote control.

948
01:18:38,777 --> 01:18:40,946
[EXPLOSION]

949
01:18:45,325 --> 01:18:47,703
I heard my former rival Fofo...

950
01:18:47,786 --> 01:18:51,957
was hit with debris from
Judge Falcone's car...

951
01:18:52,082 --> 01:18:55,836
...and his escort.
EXPLOSION - SUDDEN BRAKING

952
01:19:06,096 --> 01:19:08,348
- Jampier was affected to...
- Mamma!

953
01:19:08,473 --> 01:19:12,352
...He arrived in Via D'Amelio five minutes
after judge Borsellino.

954
01:19:12,477 --> 01:19:30,078
Mamma!

955
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:32,247
Mamma...

956
01:19:35,876 --> 01:19:37,878
Mamma!

957
01:19:39,004 --> 01:19:41,131
Mamma...

958
01:19:53,143 --> 01:19:56,605
[ARTURO] It affected all the
people of Palermo.

959
01:19:57,772 --> 01:20:01,651
But the funeral service of
Judge Paolo Borsellino...

960
01:20:01,776 --> 01:20:06,114
- ...was kept out of the cathedral.
- They are our dead!

961
01:20:06,156 --> 01:20:10,035
It's our funeral! Let us pass!

962
01:20:10,744 --> 01:20:15,415
[MAN] have shown that the
state is not with us...

963
01:20:15,498 --> 01:20:17,375
citizens... because we are here!

964
01:20:17,417 --> 01:20:20,879
Only the people of Palermo have
the right to mourn these deaths!

965
01:20:20,921 --> 01:20:24,424
They are treating us as
if we are criminals.

966
01:20:24,549 --> 01:20:27,802
We want to go to honor the dead...

967
01:20:27,928 --> 01:20:31,765
...These men died doing their duty.

968
01:20:31,806 --> 01:20:37,187
It is us who havent slept for the
last 48 hours since this happened!

969
01:20:39,981 --> 01:20:48,740
Get the mafia out of state!

970
01:20:48,865 --> 01:20:54,746
Get the mafia out of state!
[ARTURO] And I understood it too.

971
01:20:54,829 --> 01:20:57,999
Get the mafia out of state!

972
01:20:58,083 --> 01:21:03,880
- Get the mafia out of state!
- Get the mafia out of state!

973
01:21:03,964 --> 01:21:07,133
- Get the mafia out of state!
- Flora!

974
01:21:07,217 --> 01:21:12,722
Get the mafia out of state!

975
01:21:12,764 --> 01:21:18,019
- Get the mafia out of state!
- Get the mafia out of state!

976
01:21:18,103 --> 01:21:19,980
[MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND]

977
01:21:40,792 --> 01:21:42,669
[EXCITED VOICES]

978
01:22:01,938 --> 01:22:05,525
[MAN] I am a citizen like you, I have
a right to pray for these people...

979
01:22:05,567 --> 01:22:07,652
...who sacrificed with their lives.

980
01:22:26,963 --> 01:22:30,592
[MIDWIFE] Brava well done! Brava, Flora!

981
01:22:30,717 --> 01:22:33,970
Another. I see hair, come on!

982
01:22:34,053 --> 01:22:35,972
Its coming!

983
01:22:36,973 --> 01:22:39,601
Once more then it comes out.

984
01:22:39,726 --> 01:22:42,479
Be strong. Brava!

985
01:22:43,229 --> 01:22:45,106
Here he is!

986
01:22:48,443 --> 01:22:52,489
Look at that beauty! How nice!

987
01:22:53,615 --> 01:22:55,492
He's beautiful.

988
01:22:55,575 --> 01:22:57,243
[ARTURO] When I became a father...

989
01:22:57,327 --> 01:23:01,122
...I understood that parents
have two basic tasks...

990
01:23:01,247 --> 01:23:05,960
...the first one is defending their
sons from the evil of the world...

991
01:23:07,253 --> 01:23:11,508
...the second is to help you recognise it.

992
01:23:23,269 --> 01:23:26,648
Filadelfio Aparo was the deputy
sergeant of the squad of Palermo.

993
01:23:26,731 --> 01:23:28,775
He was 44 years old when he was killed.

994
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:31,152
He was considered a bloodhound.

995
01:23:38,284 --> 01:23:41,246
It is thanks to him that we have
the crime of mafia association...

996
01:23:41,287 --> 01:23:43,915
...and the seizure of
assets from the mafia.

997
01:23:55,802 --> 01:24:00,056
He worked at the Giornale di Sicilia and was
the first to understand the intentions...

998
01:24:00,181 --> 01:24:01,933
...of Toto Riina.

999
01:24:02,016 --> 01:24:05,895
Here Borsellino was killed with his escort.

1000
01:24:05,937 --> 01:24:09,315
Although he knew that the Mafia wanted
to kill him he continued.

1001
01:24:09,399 --> 01:24:10,942
He had no fear.

1002
01:24:14,946 --> 01:24:19,701
At one point he decided to go and
pressure Rome and Rome responded.

1003
01:24:19,784 --> 01:24:22,662
He did what he could not do in Palermo.

1004
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,920
Within this bar and there was
a strange gentleman with a mustache...

1005
01:24:31,004 --> 01:24:33,214
...who gave me an iris with baked ricotta.

1006
01:24:33,256 --> 01:24:38,469
He was the inspector Boris
Giuliano, a very good cop.

1007
01:24:40,763 --> 01:24:43,725
He gave me my first interview.

1008
01:24:48,271 --> 01:24:51,274
Do not deposit waste under the
tombstone of General Dalla Chiesa.

1009
01:24:55,862 --> 01:24:59,032
It was he who created the anti-mafia pool.

1010
01:24:59,157 --> 01:25:02,285
Your mother and I knew him.

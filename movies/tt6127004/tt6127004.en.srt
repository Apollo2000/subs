1
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:36,427
May I have your attention,
please?

2
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:39,691
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:43,869
thank you all, for making this
such a memorable celebration.

4
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:46,437
Now, to top off our night,

5
00:00:46,524 --> 00:00:49,179
Mr. Hingston's exquisite bride

6
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:53,879
will serenade him with
a very special love song.

7
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:09,520
Sing it again, sweetheart!

8
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:13,350
Yes, darling! Good girl!
Brava! Sing it again!

9
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:15,352
Sing it again!

10
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,922
Thank you. I'm honored
by each and every one of you.

11
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:22,142
Thank you, so very much.

12
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:31,673
What a stunning bride.

13
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,458
And what a stupendous wedding.

14
00:02:41,465 --> 00:02:43,641
Oh, there she is. Over here.

15
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:50,561
All, back to him now.

16
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:54,130
If you'll excuse me, a moment.

17
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,266
Mr. Hingston is
expecting you upstairs.

18
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:02,312
A husband shouldn't be
kept waiting any longer.

19
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,971
Your daughter is the epitome
of Upper perfection.

20
00:03:09,058 --> 00:03:11,278
She's earned the life
ahead of her.

21
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:13,323
You must be so very proud.

22
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,195
Indeed.

23
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,977
That place works miracles.

24
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:03,460
You could be
so difficult, before.

25
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:08,552
But now,

26
00:04:10,206 --> 00:04:13,383
It's as if that girl
never existed.

27
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:00,212
What?

28
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:07,872
Hello?

29
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:22,278
Good morning, Uma.

30
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:26,021
I didn't mean to startle you.
Breakfast is on its way.

31
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:28,545
Breakfast? Wait, where am I?

32
00:05:28,632 --> 00:05:30,808
You're in paradise, of course.

33
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:50,524
Mademoiselle!

34
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,363
Uma!

35
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,277
Mademoiselle!

36
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:08,280
Uma!

37
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:11,327
Uma!

38
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:27,387
Uma! Uma!

39
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:47,058
Uma!

40
00:06:57,721 --> 00:06:59,288
New in town?

41
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,637
Look, I-I need help, OK?

42
00:07:00,724 --> 00:07:02,247
They're chasing me and-and...

43
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:03,858
And I need somewhere to hide.

44
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:05,686
I don't even know
how I got here.

45
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:07,296
Come with me.

46
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:09,254
Uma! Mademoiselle!

47
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:11,039
Just come with me.

48
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,699
Wh-what is this place?

49
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:20,788
You lost something?

50
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,964
What are you doing?
No, no, no, no!

51
00:07:30,406 --> 00:07:32,539
Why won't you answer me?

52
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:38,109
What is this place?

53
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:34,426
Excuse me, but, who are you?

54
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:39,214
Some people complain that
rose bushes have thorns.

55
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:41,216
I rejoice that...

56
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:45,220
thorn bushes have roses.

57
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:47,048
What am I doing here?

58
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:49,703
Honey, you have no reason
to be afraid.

59
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,793
This is a center
for emotional healing.

60
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,969
Holistic and sustained healing.

61
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:58,799
Now, most of our girls aren't
quite so feisty when they arrive,

62
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:02,106
but I do understand how
difficult this must be for you.

63
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:04,326
Why can't I leave?

64
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:08,069
Addressing your anger issues,
is gonna take a while.

65
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:12,377
Sweetheart, they told me you
lost control again, last night.

66
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:15,685
You can tell my mother,
that she is wasting her time.

67
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:22,605
This is an opportunity, Uma.

68
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:24,781
Relax. Thank you.

69
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:27,305
Observe your life
from a new perspective.

70
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:30,004
And whose perspective
is that? Yours?

71
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:31,962
And what about mine?

72
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:34,356
You'll be with us
for two months.

73
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:37,141
All I ask in that time,
is you keep an open mind,

74
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:40,492
and, reconsider
your marriage proposal,

75
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,451
after your stay.

76
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:04,255
Luggage was arranged
by your mother, mademoiselle.

77
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:06,693
Do you all talk like that?

78
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,087
Hey!

79
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:12,481
- Well, it's about time, darling.
- Uh...

80
00:10:12,568 --> 00:10:14,701
Hi. Rough trip?

81
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:17,268
Actually, I don't
remember any of it.

82
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:18,835
Oh, well, lucky you,

83
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:20,663
because that seaplane
was sketchier

84
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,360
than a broke-ass roller coaster.

85
00:10:22,447 --> 00:10:24,101
- Sea plane?
- Yeah.

86
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:25,625
I'm Chloe.

87
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:27,061
Uma.

88
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:28,845
That's Yu.

89
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:31,326
I don't reckon she's
too keen on being here.

90
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:32,980
What, and you are?

91
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:36,374
Well, if it'll get my parents
off my back.

92
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:38,202
What's their problem?

93
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:40,770
They think two months here
is gonna turn me into

94
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:43,033
some skinny pageant queen,
like my sisters.

95
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,732
It won't, because I'm fine
just the way I am.

96
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:48,560
But, hey, I'll take
a free vacation.

97
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,562
Yu.

98
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,260
- Yu!
- What?

99
00:10:52,347 --> 00:10:53,957
Meet Uma.

100
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:56,046
- Hi.
- They told me no roommates.

101
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:58,875
Well, hey, that's not
our fault, girl.

102
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:00,703
And don't touch my stuff.

103
00:11:02,923 --> 00:11:05,316
Let's dress for dinner, ladies.

104
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:06,883
OK.

105
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:32,169
Where's the rest of it?

106
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:34,694
Our diet is
individually calibrated

107
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:38,262
for your optimum physical health
and your mental equilibrium.

108
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:42,527
Eh, uh, I can't because, um,

109
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:45,313
I'm, uh, uh,
la-lactose intolerant?

110
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,533
Allergies and intolerances have
been dutifully accounted for,

111
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,233
- and, mademoiselle, dairy is not one of yours.
- OK, fine, whatever.

112
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,365
We kindly ask you
to finish all of your dinner,

113
00:11:54,452 --> 00:11:57,586
to have sufficient nourishment
for tomorrow's activities.

114
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:00,502
Bon appétit, mademoiselles.

115
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:12,079
You know her?

116
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,689
No.

117
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:16,039
She screwed me over,
as soon as I got here.

118
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:18,694
What?

119
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:20,740
Who is she?

120
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:22,567
Seriously?!

121
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,883
Wait, that's her?

122
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,624
Amarna Vicario.

123
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,974
Yeah, her new sound
is real neat.

124
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:39,933
- She's also...
- A drunk.

125
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,674
- That's not nice.
- It's true.

126
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,069
Look, I hear her parents
are super conservative,

127
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:48,680
and they've got her in detox,
before they drag her back home.

128
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,726
You know, it really
must not be easy

129
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:53,163
- being famous.
- Yeah, it's so not easy being famous.

130
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,862
Think about the pressure.
No wonder she drinks.

131
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:58,995
- She's kind of tragic.
- Don't judge her.

132
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:17,492
What do you want?

133
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,276
Still mad about this morning?

134
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:21,017
Ya think?

135
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:23,063
Well, they were gonna
catch you, either way,

136
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,500
and I couldn't let them
find our cave.

137
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:30,548
"Our cave?"

138
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:32,246
Course. Where else are you gonna

139
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,378
light up my cigarettes
for me, hmm?

140
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:42,386
Hey...

141
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:45,563
Please don't believe
everything you hear about me.

142
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,871
I don't even drink, anymore.

143
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,874
Then, why are you here?

144
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:54,355
Well...

145
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:57,401
I wanted to do music
in my own voice.

146
00:13:57,488 --> 00:14:00,622
My team freaked out.

147
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:04,452
You see, they look at me
like a product.

148
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:07,237
They planted all those
partying stories about me,

149
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:09,674
and sent me here,

150
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:12,721
to rehab for it, I guess.

151
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:14,549
Why haven't you tried to escape?

152
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:16,943
- Escape from what?
- I don't know, exactly, but,

153
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,075
I'm not trying
to get brainwashed here.

154
00:14:19,162 --> 00:14:21,425
Well, the only thing we've done
till now is a lot of yoga

155
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:23,340
- and feeling our feelings.
- I don't care.

156
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:25,255
I'm getting out of here.

157
00:14:25,342 --> 00:14:27,146
Well, I don't know how
you think you're gonna do that,

158
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,520
because we're on an island
in the middle of the ocean.

159
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:31,044
Tonight.

160
00:14:33,785 --> 00:14:37,137
OK. I'll help you.

161
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:40,705
Meet me outside my room.

162
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:42,969
Midnight.

163
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:48,539
Hey.

164
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:54,197
How do you get cigarettes?

165
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:56,634
An attendant gives them to me.

166
00:14:57,722 --> 00:14:59,507
His daughter's a fan.

167
00:14:59,594 --> 00:15:01,074
I video chat with her.

168
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:05,992
You know, Uma,

169
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,559
There's always a way
to get what you want.

170
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:11,693
Always.

171
00:15:58,261 --> 00:16:00,046
My Dears,

172
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:01,438
the sun is rising,

173
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:04,485
and in the fresh light
of this new day,

174
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:05,790
let us welcome

175
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:09,664
Chloe, Yu, and Uma.

176
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:11,448
To our family.

177
00:16:20,675 --> 00:16:21,850
Hey.

178
00:16:21,937 --> 00:16:23,330
Can you...

179
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:24,896
Sure.

180
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:30,032
Sorry, I fell asleep.

181
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:31,860
How long did you wait for me?

182
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:34,863
I, actually, fell asleep, too.

183
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,473
Mademoiselle.

184
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:41,913
Please confirm your chosen look.

185
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:50,009
Hell, yes.

186
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:52,663
Oh, no. No, no. I've got to...

187
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,796
Please, mademoiselle.

188
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:55,971
Can't do it.

189
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:57,712
The look might grow on you.

190
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:00,845
It looks good.

191
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:02,325
It isn't me.

192
00:17:07,635 --> 00:17:09,811
Mommy's perfect little Upper.

193
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:12,335
You don't have to change
who you are, Uma.

194
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:19,560
Relax, Uma. This'll
only take a minute.

195
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:21,344
Ow!

196
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,828
Ow.

197
00:17:28,395 --> 00:17:30,353
Please sit still, mademoiselle.

198
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:32,573
Ow!

199
00:17:58,164 --> 00:18:00,166
It's like looking
at somebody else.

200
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:01,776
Yeah.

201
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,953
Someone I don't like.

202
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:12,526
Dearest.

203
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:14,702
How are you adjusting, honey?

204
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:18,009
Great. I've always wanted to go
to a fascist boarding school,

205
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,838
so, this is kind of
a dream come true.

206
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:24,190
Well, I certainly hope
we can change that for you.

207
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:26,540
Please sit, and face the mirror.

208
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:29,151
Please, sit down.

209
00:18:33,982 --> 00:18:36,898
Uma, I know you think
this isn't the place for you,

210
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:38,639
and you may be right,

211
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:41,598
But I'm asking you to be
the tiniest bit receptive...

212
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:43,122
To your propaganda?

213
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:55,177
We are at our best,
when we are truly ourselves.

214
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:58,049
Can we agree on that?

215
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:02,228
Mirror Therapy is about
owning your story.

216
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:06,101
It's about remembering
what makes you, you.

217
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,234
Only the things
that you would know.

218
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:13,413
Tell yourself the story
of who you truly are.

219
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,981
You want me to talk to myself?

220
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:20,159
Well, you don't seem
to enjoy talking to me.

221
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,944
How about this?

222
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:24,380
I'll ask you a question.

223
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:27,340
Answer only if you want to, OK?

224
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:31,909
What was the one thing
your mother never gave you?

225
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:33,128
What?

226
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:35,086
Try and look in the mirror.

227
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,829
Does she look after you?

228
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,005
She looks after herself.

229
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:43,530
- You're very tough on her.
- She deserves it.

230
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:46,359
- Do you love her?
- What are you trying to do here?

231
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:49,231
OK, I am not gonna
marry that prick.

232
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:57,239
It's hard to find a good man
in this world, Uma.

233
00:19:58,632 --> 00:20:00,286
I would know.

234
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:20,175
Keep it up, mademoiselles.

235
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:23,483
Control of the body,
clarity of the mind.

236
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,053
All right. And work
in pairs now, please.

237
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,884
Yu.

238
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:37,323
- Come on.
- No.

239
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,716
I need a partner.

240
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:44,721
Assume.

241
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:46,419
- And forward.
- Come on.

242
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:48,029
I can't do this on my own.

243
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:49,944
Come on.

244
00:20:50,945 --> 00:20:52,686
And back.

245
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:58,431
And forward.

246
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:04,741
And back.

247
00:21:07,614 --> 00:21:09,529
Forward.

248
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:17,580
And back.

249
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:29,418
And back.

250
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:31,290
Uma? Uma.

251
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:34,118
Are you still with us?

252
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:36,425
Yeah, sorry.

253
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:38,819
OK.

254
00:21:38,906 --> 00:21:41,169
And forward.

255
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:46,522
And back.

256
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:10,633
Your gloves, please.

257
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,074
It's a little tight.

258
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:19,773
It's for your safety. Please.

259
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:46,756
Sorry about that. We're, uh,

260
00:22:46,843 --> 00:22:49,106
we're attempting to resolve
some technical issues.

261
00:22:49,193 --> 00:22:51,370
Please, hang tight.

262
00:22:57,158 --> 00:22:59,029
Lowers like to

263
00:22:59,116 --> 00:23:01,597
say all kinds of things
about me,

264
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:03,991
but the truth is,

265
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:05,558
I'm a simple man.

266
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:09,126
I work hard,

267
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:12,652
and I give back.

268
00:23:16,612 --> 00:23:19,267
I may be a sensitive guy,

269
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:22,749
but don't let anyone tell you,

270
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:25,447
I don't know how
to have a good time.

271
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:31,758
Maybe my idea of fun
can be a bit extreme,

272
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:35,457
but, in both business and life,

273
00:23:36,806 --> 00:23:39,113
what's the point
of dreaming small?

274
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:46,990
Lowers like to say

275
00:23:47,077 --> 00:23:48,905
all kinds of things about me,

276
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,647
- OK, I get it.
- But the truth is,

277
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:54,433
I'm a simple man.

278
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,826
- I get it!
- I work hard,

279
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:58,828
- and I give back.
- Hello?

280
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:01,570
- But the truth is...
- Turn it off?

281
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:03,616
Simple man...

282
00:24:03,703 --> 00:24:07,707
I work hard... But the truth is...

283
00:24:16,846 --> 00:24:18,500
simple man... But...

284
00:24:18,587 --> 00:24:20,720
Maybe my idea of fun

285
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:23,287
can be a bit extreme.

286
00:24:23,374 --> 00:24:28,031
I may be a sensitive guy.
I may be a sensitive guy.

287
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:29,903
Sensitive guy.

288
00:25:00,324 --> 00:25:03,110
We're so sorry,
the system failed.

289
00:25:03,197 --> 00:25:05,504
We couldn't stop
the projection remotely.

290
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:07,723
The infirmary
will patch those up.

291
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,812
We're so sorry.

292
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:25,045
You really think that stupid video
is gonna get me to change my mind?

293
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:29,266
Oh, honey. Let me
take a look at those hands.

294
00:25:30,354 --> 00:25:31,834
Come here.

295
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:36,186
Perhaps he is
a bit heavy-handed.

296
00:25:38,275 --> 00:25:40,147
But he means well.

297
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:42,323
"Means well?"

298
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,978
He's a sociopath.

299
00:25:45,065 --> 00:25:47,502
Besides, it doesn't matter.

300
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:50,636
I'm in love with somebody else.

301
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:53,160
Your mother never told me
about anyone else.

302
00:25:53,247 --> 00:25:54,640
Of course not. He's a Lower,

303
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:56,729
so, he basically
doesn't exist to her.

304
00:25:58,905 --> 00:26:01,429
Your father was not
a good influence, Uma.

305
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:07,174
Look at me.

306
00:26:08,305 --> 00:26:10,481
I have dedicated my whole life

307
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,136
to taking care of
Mother's little garden.

308
00:26:13,223 --> 00:26:15,878
But you, if you could
learn your place,

309
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:19,273
you have your
best years ahead of you.

310
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,231
Don't end up like me.

311
00:26:27,194 --> 00:26:29,370
So sad!

312
00:26:29,457 --> 00:26:32,025
Would you like to help me
clip some thorns?

313
00:26:44,298 --> 00:26:47,693
So, your ma just likes him
because he's rich?

314
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:51,784
She's an Upper, but we're broke.

315
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:54,613
She thinks the marriage
will save our family.

316
00:26:55,962 --> 00:26:58,704
That sucks. I'm sorry, dude.

317
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:03,447
Am I the only one
getting married off, here?

318
00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:07,103
I wish all I had to do
was marry some rich guy.

319
00:27:08,017 --> 00:27:09,149
You don't mean that.

320
00:27:09,236 --> 00:27:11,281
Well, my video was people

321
00:27:11,368 --> 00:27:13,893
just jogging and eating,
like, celery.

322
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,244
I mean, if it was that easy,
everyone would look like Amarna.

323
00:27:17,331 --> 00:27:20,247
Why, thank you, Chloe.

324
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,338
Screw this.

325
00:27:24,425 --> 00:27:28,342
No, hey. Here, let me help.

326
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:30,736
I can't do this. I-I just can't.

327
00:27:30,823 --> 00:27:32,389
No.

328
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,526
What'd they show you in there?

329
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:40,702
It was a documentary
about my thing.

330
00:27:42,051 --> 00:27:46,142
I get anxious.
Like, panic-attack anxious.

331
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:48,754
I feel like I'm dying,
when I have one.

332
00:27:50,538 --> 00:27:52,496
My parents are Lowers.

333
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:55,238
They sent me to Beijing
to live with my aunt and uncle.

334
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:57,893
Big shot Uppers, but...

335
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,243
I just don't know
how to act around them.

336
00:28:01,244 --> 00:28:03,116
I don't know how to be.

337
00:28:04,378 --> 00:28:06,423
I embarrass them.

338
00:28:08,512 --> 00:28:09,992
So, they sent me here,

339
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,561
told me not to come back
until I got better.

340
00:28:13,648 --> 00:28:16,738
Hey, you're not like
the other Lowers.

341
00:28:16,825 --> 00:28:18,871
You got a choice now.

342
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:20,829
Yeah, well, maybe
my idea of success,

343
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:24,877
isn't stepping on
everyone below me.

344
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:27,618
There, there,
my little tapioca pudding.

345
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,969
You're in our
brave new world now.

346
00:28:30,056 --> 00:28:32,667
We know you've suffered,
my peanut,

347
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:35,626
but don't you worry.
You most surely will be redeemed,

348
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:39,108
by an excellent hairstyle and
a truly mediocre personality.

349
00:28:39,195 --> 00:28:40,283
I hate you guys.

350
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:42,982
Come on.

351
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:44,418
Hey.

352
00:28:46,637 --> 00:28:48,770
So when you go back to Beijing,

353
00:28:48,857 --> 00:28:50,076
you're gonna form what?

354
00:28:50,163 --> 00:28:51,642
Uh, Sammy.

355
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,427
Sammy and the
Decapitated Head Horses.

356
00:28:53,514 --> 00:28:55,734
- Charming.
- Wait, who's Sammy?

357
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:58,432
I'm Sammy.
I formed the band, so...

358
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,347
Wait, you're singing?

359
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:03,002
Uh, Amarna sings.

360
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:04,655
I do this...

361
00:29:06,657 --> 00:29:08,659
That ain't music!

362
00:29:14,187 --> 00:29:16,624
- Real funny.
- Give me my headphones.

363
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:32,161
My dearests...
the sun is rising.

364
00:29:58,971 --> 00:30:02,191
She visited me the first
time the album went platinum.

365
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:07,370
We went swimming.
Just the two of us.

366
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:10,504
It was a beautiful,
clear day, but...

367
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,508
the current was just too strong.

368
00:30:14,595 --> 00:30:16,640
I told her I was not
gonna leave with her.

369
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,556
I was gonna stay.

370
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:25,649
She said, "Whatever you want,
I want for you."

371
00:30:25,736 --> 00:30:28,348
She started getting
pulled under the waves.

372
00:30:29,392 --> 00:30:31,873
I, uh...

373
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,268
I, uh, managed
to get her back to shore.

374
00:30:35,355 --> 00:30:38,314
And I just wrapped my arms
around her.

375
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:39,925
I wish she meant it.

376
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:45,626
I wish she meant it,
with every part of my life.

377
00:30:46,627 --> 00:30:48,498
I was terrified of losing her.

378
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:51,937
Terrified of just being...

379
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:54,504
completely alone.

380
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:56,289
But at that time...

381
00:30:57,551 --> 00:30:59,335
those words were just...

382
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:04,079
enough.

383
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:06,038
That was the last time
I told her I loved her.

384
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,648
I told her I loved her.

385
00:31:10,303 --> 00:31:12,174
Very good, Uma.

386
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:14,481
I'm proud of you.

387
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:23,751
Nice. Now you twist the
ends together, like this.

388
00:31:23,838 --> 00:31:25,884
When I leave this place...

389
00:31:25,971 --> 00:31:27,668
I'm gonna go

390
00:31:27,755 --> 00:31:30,279
somewhere far,
far away from here.

391
00:31:31,802 --> 00:31:34,283
I just want to be somewhere,
where I can...

392
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:38,287
start all over again.

393
00:31:38,374 --> 00:31:40,550
Where nobody really knows
who I am.

394
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:52,127
What about you?

395
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:56,958
I told you,
I'm in love with someone.

396
00:31:58,742 --> 00:32:01,136
We just want to be together...

397
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:03,138
and have a simple life.

398
00:32:08,187 --> 00:32:12,191
Uma, isn't that a memory locket?

399
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:15,107
It's the prototype
for all the rest.

400
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,957
They still make them?

401
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:45,833
Not the way my dad used to.

402
00:33:24,698 --> 00:33:26,700
How did you...?

403
00:33:28,136 --> 00:33:30,704
I promised I'd find you.

404
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:39,582
How did you even find me?

405
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:42,020
Showed up at
your mother's place.

406
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:44,109
She was not happy to see me.

407
00:33:44,196 --> 00:33:46,024
What did she say?

408
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:48,548
That you were getting ready
to marry Son.

409
00:33:48,635 --> 00:33:50,854
But I'm not marrying him.
I told her that...

410
00:33:50,941 --> 00:33:53,205
I know, I know. Shh, shh.

411
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:01,039
I applied for the job,
as soon as I could.

412
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,563
Listen, Uma,

413
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:06,044
I'm gonna get you
off this island.

414
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:12,528
No. Not here.

415
00:34:30,372 --> 00:34:32,331
Swiped this from the tech guys.

416
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:34,463
The feed will just show
an empty room,

417
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,639
same as before.

418
00:34:39,468 --> 00:34:40,861
Listen...

419
00:34:45,257 --> 00:34:47,128
I'm gonna join the cargo crew.

420
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:49,391
When I do,
I'll sneak you into the hold.

421
00:34:49,478 --> 00:34:52,916
We'll fly to the mainland and
I'll get you off that plane.

422
00:34:53,003 --> 00:34:55,093
An-and go where?

423
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,138
We'll figure it out.

424
00:34:57,225 --> 00:34:58,835
As long as we're together.

425
00:35:03,362 --> 00:35:06,147
Is that what you want, too?

426
00:35:38,527 --> 00:35:41,791
What? That is so romantic.

427
00:35:41,878 --> 00:35:44,490
I mean, he came
all this way for you?

428
00:35:44,577 --> 00:35:47,536
Just in time to save you from that
shit you're supposed to marry.

429
00:35:47,623 --> 00:35:49,277
Uma doesn't need saving.

430
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,673
He's gonna help me escape.

431
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,893
You just have to be nice to the
staff, fake the treatments.

432
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,331
You don't need to escape.

433
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:01,376
I finally have a partner
in all of this.

434
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:05,032
And what am I?

435
00:36:07,991 --> 00:36:10,385
You shouldn't
trust that guy, Uma.

436
00:36:10,472 --> 00:36:12,953
Wh...
I've known him, my entire life.

437
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,608
- Well, I don't think he deserves you.
- How would you know?

438
00:36:15,695 --> 00:36:18,828
Amarna! You're up, girl.

439
00:36:21,135 --> 00:36:22,397
Whoo!

440
00:36:22,484 --> 00:36:24,182
Go, Amarna!

441
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:25,661
Yeah!

442
00:36:26,793 --> 00:36:28,708
Stop the music, please.

443
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:38,212
Bedtime, mademoiselles.

444
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:40,258
No.

445
00:37:41,824 --> 00:37:44,131
Off stage. Go.

446
00:37:45,785 --> 00:37:48,440
Listen, I don't want to
repeat it. Just, go.

447
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,698
Just once,

448
00:38:29,785 --> 00:38:33,311
can she play some shit that
isn't, like, a hundred years old?

449
00:38:41,057 --> 00:38:44,496
- Have you seen my necklace? My locket?
- No.

450
00:38:59,511 --> 00:39:03,253
Security perimeter breach.
Security perimeter breach...

451
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:07,170
- Interfering boat type zero-zero-one-two...
- Look at these clowns.

452
00:39:07,257 --> 00:39:11,087
Male subject. All safety
personnel to Beach A-Three...

453
00:39:11,174 --> 00:39:13,873
Interns are to initiate
regular morning activities...

454
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,225
- Security instructions will...
- Girls! The showers. Now!

455
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:19,966
Come on, mademoiselles. Move it!

456
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:22,098
Please,
resume standard procedures.

457
00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:24,797
We repeat.
Please, resume stan...

458
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:26,625
to Beach A-Three...

459
00:39:26,712 --> 00:39:28,627
We repeat, perimeter breach...

460
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:31,760
- What's that boat doing here?
- No clue.

461
00:39:31,847 --> 00:39:33,545
We repeat, perimeter breach...

462
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:36,548
It's unacceptable.
Who is this intruder?

463
00:39:36,635 --> 00:39:38,941
Fetch him. Fetch him at once!

464
00:39:39,028 --> 00:39:41,030
Why are you still here?
Go wash yourselves!

465
00:39:41,117 --> 00:39:43,381
- Whose boat is that?
- Are you deaf?

466
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:45,600
Well, I was just asking
whose boat...

467
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:47,907
- OK, get out of here. Go, go!
- Hey, hey!

468
00:39:47,994 --> 00:39:49,430
Hey! Back off!

469
00:39:52,346 --> 00:39:55,131
- What did you say?
- I said, back off.

470
00:39:58,047 --> 00:39:59,875
- Yu!
- Mademoiselle!

471
00:40:01,094 --> 00:40:04,358
Don't you ever touch me again.

472
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:09,189
I will send you home
to your family, a failure,

473
00:40:09,276 --> 00:40:10,625
a disgrace.

474
00:40:10,712 --> 00:40:11,974
Is that what you want?

475
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:13,149
Is it?

476
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:17,023
Enough.

477
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,503
Stop.

478
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,811
I said stop!

479
00:40:22,898 --> 00:40:25,553
If she leaves, we all leave.

480
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,600
You hear me?

481
00:40:28,687 --> 00:40:30,993
Yeah. We'll tell
everybody about this.

482
00:40:32,386 --> 00:40:34,127
I am so sorry.

483
00:40:34,214 --> 00:40:36,085
I lost my composure.

484
00:40:36,172 --> 00:40:39,349
We are dealing with
a situation this morning.

485
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,352
Thank you so much, for helping me.
Um, find him.

486
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,964
And turn off this...
ridiculous alarm.

487
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:47,706
It's OK. Just breathe,
just breathe, just breathe.

488
00:40:47,793 --> 00:40:49,011
It's OK.

489
00:40:51,797 --> 00:40:54,234
- Look, there he is.
- The mystery man.

490
00:40:54,321 --> 00:40:57,411
He ran into the rocks,
like he wanted to crash.

491
00:40:57,498 --> 00:41:00,283
She interrogated him, herself.
I can't even imagine.

492
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:03,243
I heard he came to see Amarna.
He demanded an audience.

493
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,593
- Superfan.
- Super creep.

494
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,816
So the attendant
that gets me cigs

495
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:13,558
lets me use his station in exchange
for passes to my comeback show.

496
00:41:13,645 --> 00:41:16,038
That guy sailed
all the way here to see you?

497
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:17,649
Not exactly.

498
00:41:18,693 --> 00:41:20,565
Holy shit.

499
00:41:20,652 --> 00:41:22,654
That's what he really
came to do.

500
00:41:26,005 --> 00:41:27,397
- How?
- Uma,

501
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,182
there's no stalker.

502
00:41:29,269 --> 00:41:31,010
It was all a front.

503
00:41:31,097 --> 00:41:32,968
My admirer
stashed the rowboat here,

504
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:35,275
and sailed around
the island all night,

505
00:41:35,362 --> 00:41:38,060
but nobody
spotted him till dawn.

506
00:41:40,062 --> 00:41:42,369
They're not guarding
the coast at night.

507
00:41:42,456 --> 00:41:44,458
That's our way out of here.

508
00:41:44,545 --> 00:41:46,025
We come here after dinner,

509
00:41:46,112 --> 00:41:48,027
we get on the rowboat,
and we go to shore.

510
00:41:48,114 --> 00:41:50,769
It's only ten miles.
We can do it. Uma.

511
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,383
Please.

512
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:58,777
I thought you didn't
want to leave at all.

513
00:41:58,864 --> 00:42:00,735
What's changed?

514
00:42:06,915 --> 00:42:08,874
Last night, I was
able to stay awake,

515
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:11,485
for the first time
since we've been here.

516
00:42:12,878 --> 00:42:14,314
You know why?

517
00:42:15,794 --> 00:42:19,798
Because,
I didn't drink the milk.

518
00:42:19,885 --> 00:42:21,713
They've been drugging us,
every night.

519
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,802
They make us sleep
like we're dead.

520
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:28,763
But, the Residence
isn't sleeping.

521
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,897
Where did you find this?

522
00:42:31,984 --> 00:42:33,986
It was in the patio,
by the mermaid.

523
00:42:34,073 --> 00:42:36,292
There was staff
that I didn't recognize,

524
00:42:36,379 --> 00:42:38,120
wheeling
passed-out girls around.

525
00:42:38,991 --> 00:42:41,080
What?!

526
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:42,298
Listen, we have to go.

527
00:42:42,385 --> 00:42:43,561
Tonight.

528
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,737
We don't drink our milk,

529
00:42:45,824 --> 00:42:47,652
and we meet here, after curfew.

530
00:42:47,739 --> 00:42:49,001
I have to tell Markus.

531
00:42:49,088 --> 00:42:50,872
No, Uma, you can't.

532
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:53,309
I can't disappear on him, again.

533
00:43:02,754 --> 00:43:04,059
OK.

534
00:43:06,018 --> 00:43:09,369
Just... don't give him
any details.

535
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,855
Listen.

536
00:43:16,942 --> 00:43:19,858
They're gonna transfer me
to the cargo crew tomorrow.

537
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:23,165
We'll be out of here in
a couple of weeks, maybe less.

538
00:43:26,081 --> 00:43:28,562
Wow, don't get too excited.

539
00:43:29,476 --> 00:43:31,173
Uh, I am. It's just...

540
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,827
What?

541
00:43:37,832 --> 00:43:40,400
I have to tell you something.

542
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:04,206
Mesdemoiselles,
your attention, please.

543
00:44:05,512 --> 00:44:07,166
Once, in a blue moon,

544
00:44:07,253 --> 00:44:10,125
a resident is so receptive
to what we offer,

545
00:44:10,212 --> 00:44:12,911
that she's ready to
rejoin her loved ones,

546
00:44:12,998 --> 00:44:15,478
sooner than expected.

547
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:20,135
And, so it is, with our own...

548
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,965
Amarna.

549
00:44:24,052 --> 00:44:26,576
We shouldn't be sad to
see her leave us this evening.

550
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,449
We should instead,
let our hearts swell with joy,

551
00:44:29,536 --> 00:44:32,408
at the strong young woman,
Amarna has become,

552
00:44:32,495 --> 00:44:34,149
during her time here.

553
00:44:34,236 --> 00:44:35,847
To Amarna.

554
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:34,949
Uma. Uma.

555
00:45:35,036 --> 00:45:36,255
Listen to me, OK?

556
00:45:38,561 --> 00:45:43,001
You take that boat
with Markus. It's yours.

557
00:45:44,306 --> 00:45:46,265
But, how will I find you?

558
00:45:55,013 --> 00:45:56,318
What?

559
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:05,763
Hey.

560
00:46:08,548 --> 00:46:11,377
You promise, right?

561
00:46:13,553 --> 00:46:15,033
I promise.

562
00:46:32,267 --> 00:46:33,878
I'll see you there, OK?

563
00:46:33,965 --> 00:46:37,098
Amarna? Time to go.

564
00:46:37,185 --> 00:46:40,928
Yeah. I, uh, I'm coming.

565
00:46:50,982 --> 00:46:52,722
Be safe.

566
00:47:29,063 --> 00:47:31,544
Yeah, it is ugly.

567
00:48:17,807 --> 00:48:19,157
What the hell?

568
00:48:19,244 --> 00:48:21,507
How did she get
all the way over here?

569
00:48:24,292 --> 00:48:26,338
The sedative's slow sometimes.

570
00:48:26,425 --> 00:48:28,514
Hits them on the way
to the bathroom.

571
00:48:28,601 --> 00:48:31,299
- Are we taking her to the OR?
- No.

572
00:48:31,386 --> 00:48:32,822
It's not her turn tonight.

573
00:48:57,717 --> 00:48:59,414
What's up with you?

574
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:01,068
I'm fine.

575
00:49:01,155 --> 00:49:03,723
Yeah? 'Cause you're
scaring the mirror.

576
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:06,334
I just had weird dreams
last night.

577
00:49:06,421 --> 00:49:10,121
Really? I ain't never
had a dream here.

578
00:50:08,918 --> 00:50:12,357
The beloved artisan apparently
took his own life last night.

579
00:50:12,444 --> 00:50:16,535
Financially ruined by the hostile
takeover of his family-owned business.

580
00:50:16,622 --> 00:50:18,711
Orchestrated the purchase...

581
00:50:18,798 --> 00:50:21,235
Stop! Turn it off!

582
00:50:21,322 --> 00:50:23,411
Costly legal battle...

583
00:50:23,498 --> 00:50:25,631
- Turn it off!
- Mr. Hingston fired the staff

584
00:50:25,718 --> 00:50:28,068
and automated the factory.

585
00:50:28,155 --> 00:50:30,070
Let me down!

586
00:50:30,157 --> 00:50:32,072
Of course. I've made
the necessary arrangements.

587
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:34,031
Let me out of here!

588
00:50:34,118 --> 00:50:35,771
Let me down!

589
00:50:36,598 --> 00:50:37,991
Turn it off!

590
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,872
This place is a fucking lie!

591
00:50:49,959 --> 00:50:53,224
What are you doing to us?
What are you doing to us?

592
00:50:56,227 --> 00:50:59,230
Mademoiselle, stop!

593
00:50:59,317 --> 00:51:00,927
No, stop it! You're lying to us!

594
00:51:01,014 --> 00:51:03,408
- Why are you lying to us?
- Mademoiselle, be still!

595
00:51:03,495 --> 00:51:05,714
Uma! Where are you taking her?

596
00:51:05,801 --> 00:51:08,891
- Yu!
- We don't wish to hurt you mademoiselle.

597
00:51:08,978 --> 00:51:10,458
Please!

598
00:51:12,895 --> 00:51:16,073
Markus! Help me!

599
00:51:39,748 --> 00:51:41,707
Easy, Uma.

600
00:51:48,192 --> 00:51:49,497
Sit.

601
00:51:55,677 --> 00:51:56,939
Finish it.

602
00:52:04,469 --> 00:52:06,775
Why don't you drink me?

603
00:52:59,306 --> 00:53:00,829
Good morning, Uma.

604
00:53:01,656 --> 00:53:03,310
What's going on?

605
00:53:03,963 --> 00:53:05,182
What?

606
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:06,835
Ow. No, no, no!

607
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:09,447
Let me go!

608
00:53:45,918 --> 00:53:48,225
Over here, over here!

609
00:54:04,937 --> 00:54:07,069
How about a kiss?

610
00:54:49,808 --> 00:54:51,375
Well,

611
00:54:52,245 --> 00:54:53,812
isn't that a pickle?

612
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,903
You think this place is a lie.

613
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:01,036
Look at your friend.

614
00:55:01,123 --> 00:55:05,214
Her treatment seems rather effective
in the end, don't you think?

615
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:10,350
I think both her label and her family will
be very, very pleased with the result.

616
00:55:11,569 --> 00:55:14,267
Oh, you got to see this.

617
00:55:15,399 --> 00:55:18,532
This is what Son paid

618
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:22,101
to have you...
skip our waiting list.

619
00:55:23,189 --> 00:55:24,625
Do you think he would spend

620
00:55:24,712 --> 00:55:26,975
so much money on
something that doesn't work?

621
00:55:30,501 --> 00:55:32,372
Understand this.

622
00:55:32,459 --> 00:55:34,505
The therapy is real.

623
00:55:35,941 --> 00:55:38,944
You're just
a prickly little pear.

624
00:55:40,032 --> 00:55:42,077
And now you're done.

625
00:55:42,164 --> 00:55:43,862
What are you talking about?

626
00:55:43,949 --> 00:55:45,820
Oh, we're nearly finished
with you, Uma.

627
00:55:45,907 --> 00:55:48,867
By tomorrow you'll be able
to leave here forever.

628
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,523
Tomorrow?

629
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:54,351
Frankly, I thought
you'd be happier.

630
00:55:54,438 --> 00:55:57,528
I was under the impression
you couldn't wait to go.

631
00:55:57,615 --> 00:55:59,225
How long have I been asleep?

632
00:55:59,312 --> 00:56:02,010
How long have you been asleep...

633
00:56:02,097 --> 00:56:04,404
Two weeks.

634
00:56:12,064 --> 00:56:13,848
Run along now, little bug.

635
00:56:14,806 --> 00:56:16,373
Your friends miss you.

636
00:56:29,908 --> 00:56:32,258
- Sure you're OK?
- Yes.

637
00:56:32,345 --> 00:56:35,174
They told us you went nuts,
that you broke that damn horse.

638
00:56:35,261 --> 00:56:37,176
- Is that true?
- OK, forget about all that.

639
00:56:37,263 --> 00:56:40,745
The Amarna we said goodbye to
is not the Amarna I saw on TV.

640
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,139
They did something to her.

641
00:56:44,226 --> 00:56:45,266
And I'm not waiting around

642
00:56:45,314 --> 00:56:46,881
for them to do it to me.

643
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:51,364
I'm leaving.

644
00:56:51,451 --> 00:56:53,453
And I want you two
to come with me.

645
00:56:56,282 --> 00:56:59,024
- How?
- Tonight.

646
00:56:59,111 --> 00:57:01,418
We throw up our milk,
we sneak out of the Residence,

647
00:57:01,505 --> 00:57:03,594
and we row this frickin' boat
to the mainland.

648
00:57:03,681 --> 00:57:05,552
And then what? I can't
go home until I'm cured.

649
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:07,249
My aunt and uncle
will throw me out.

650
00:57:07,336 --> 00:57:08,512
So don't go home.

651
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:11,645
What do you mean?

652
00:57:15,083 --> 00:57:16,433
I know somewhere else.

653
00:57:17,608 --> 00:57:19,174
Somewhere safe.

654
00:57:20,262 --> 00:57:22,743
Look, our families sent us here

655
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:24,702
to shape us in their image.

656
00:57:24,789 --> 00:57:26,312
Not ours.

657
00:57:27,705 --> 00:57:28,967
I'm not doing it.

658
00:57:35,277 --> 00:57:36,583
Are you with me?

659
00:57:41,849 --> 00:57:43,416
Screw 'em.

660
00:57:48,116 --> 00:57:49,378
Come with us.

661
00:57:51,424 --> 00:57:52,556
I can't.

662
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:57,343
It's OK.

663
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:58,866
But we'll be waiting
for you tonight

664
00:57:58,953 --> 00:58:00,172
if you change your mind.

665
00:58:00,955 --> 00:58:01,956
Yeah.

666
00:58:07,614 --> 00:58:09,268
It's my fault.

667
00:58:09,355 --> 00:58:11,400
I should have tried to
join the crew sooner...

668
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,924
It's only three more days.

669
00:58:14,534 --> 00:58:17,842
Listen. I will be on
the next plane out next week.

670
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:19,931
I'll meet you on the mainland.

671
00:58:20,018 --> 00:58:24,239
And I swear I... I will never let
anything tear us apart again.

672
00:58:28,287 --> 00:58:30,245
- OK.
- Yeah?

673
00:58:34,032 --> 00:58:35,903
I'll wait for you.

674
00:58:55,444 --> 00:58:58,796
Mademoiselle, finish
your dinner, please.

675
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:26,563
I-I got to take a leak.

676
00:59:38,749 --> 00:59:40,446
Yu!

677
00:59:49,542 --> 00:59:51,849
I'm not the one
that needs to change.

678
01:00:08,517 --> 01:00:10,607
Ready?

679
01:00:25,752 --> 01:00:28,755
These girls are
supposed to be completed.

680
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,323
She's done.

681
01:00:32,324 --> 01:00:33,978
She's done.

682
01:00:36,023 --> 01:00:38,591
Wait, this one's still got
one session left.

683
01:00:40,288 --> 01:00:42,595
OK, let's get to it.

684
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:25,116
What do we do?

685
01:01:25,203 --> 01:01:28,206
We can't leave her behind.
Come on.

686
01:01:40,131 --> 01:01:42,524
- That way.
- OK.

687
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:02,779
Head right, huh?

688
01:03:14,312 --> 01:03:15,792
Let's go.

689
01:03:19,883 --> 01:03:23,364
First off, your boat's
a piece of shit.

690
01:03:23,451 --> 01:03:25,976
Damn, it's not fair.

691
01:03:26,063 --> 01:03:29,414
Secondly, you got zero patience.

692
01:03:29,501 --> 01:03:31,503
Wait.

693
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:33,374
We got to update the log.

694
01:03:33,461 --> 01:03:35,376
Ah, jeez.

695
01:03:35,463 --> 01:03:38,249
Can we wait till
after dinner? I'm starving.

696
01:03:38,336 --> 01:03:40,642
Let's just get it
over with, huh?

697
01:03:40,729 --> 01:03:42,557
Fine.

698
01:03:42,644 --> 01:03:44,777
You say I've got no patience.

699
01:03:44,864 --> 01:03:46,997
You're the one who
always got to eat so bad.

700
01:04:01,576 --> 01:04:04,449
We'll do a full modeling
of her vocal chords

701
01:04:04,536 --> 01:04:08,235
as well as a scan
of the pupil and the iris.

702
01:04:08,322 --> 01:04:09,952
Yo, isn't she roommates
with that fat Southern girl?

703
01:04:09,976 --> 01:04:11,760
I think so. Why?

704
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,937
Don't know. I kinda
like that one.

705
01:04:14,024 --> 01:04:16,200
I feel sorry for her, though.

706
01:04:16,287 --> 01:04:18,289
What about ones you don't like?

707
01:04:18,376 --> 01:04:20,552
You don't feel sorry for them?

708
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:22,554
Yo, if I felt sorry
for all of them

709
01:04:22,641 --> 01:04:24,599
this job would be
un-freakin-bearable.

710
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:28,865
- Chloe!
- Let her go, douche-canoes!

711
01:04:28,952 --> 01:04:31,258
Christ, man, call her!

712
01:04:31,345 --> 01:04:33,434
What is it?

713
01:04:33,521 --> 01:04:35,654
Two girls are awake.
They're here in the OR.

714
01:04:35,741 --> 01:04:38,570
- Who?
- Mademoiselle Yu's roommates. She's also awake.

715
01:04:38,657 --> 01:04:40,267
Do I need to hold your hand?

716
01:04:40,354 --> 01:04:42,226
They're completed.
Finish them off!

717
01:04:43,401 --> 01:04:44,793
No!

718
01:04:47,709 --> 01:04:49,102
Chloe!

719
01:04:49,189 --> 01:04:51,061
We might need
some help here. Ow!

720
01:04:57,502 --> 01:04:58,590
Uma!

721
01:04:58,677 --> 01:05:00,244
Yu!

722
01:05:07,294 --> 01:05:09,209
Yu! Yu, breathe!

723
01:05:34,582 --> 01:05:36,019
Ow!

724
01:05:54,646 --> 01:05:56,691
Easy, sweethear...

725
01:05:59,738 --> 01:06:00,782
Yu!

726
01:06:01,392 --> 01:06:02,741
Yu. Yu.

727
01:06:02,828 --> 01:06:05,135
Yu, Yu, Yu, Yu.

728
01:06:05,222 --> 01:06:07,354
It's OK, it's OK.

729
01:06:07,441 --> 01:06:08,660
Here, I got you.

730
01:06:08,747 --> 01:06:10,357
Here. Here.

731
01:06:11,663 --> 01:06:13,099
Come on.

732
01:06:28,897 --> 01:06:30,073
Shh.

733
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,553
What is that?

734
01:06:33,206 --> 01:06:34,729
I don't know.

735
01:06:37,863 --> 01:06:39,473
Put her over here.

736
01:07:03,584 --> 01:07:06,631
I don't know how to be.
I embarrass them.

737
01:07:10,939 --> 01:07:13,681
And whose perspective
is that, yours?

738
01:07:13,768 --> 01:07:16,293
Observe your life from
a new perspective.

739
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:18,251
And whose perspective
is that, yours?

740
01:07:18,338 --> 01:07:21,428
I don't know how to be.
I embarrass them.

741
01:07:21,515 --> 01:07:23,300
I embarrass them.

742
01:07:23,387 --> 01:07:26,042
OK, I am not gonna
marry that prick.

743
01:07:26,129 --> 01:07:27,826
Turn it off!

744
01:07:35,486 --> 01:07:38,097
They're not treating us.

745
01:07:38,184 --> 01:07:39,751
They've been observing us.

746
01:07:41,405 --> 01:07:44,495
Measuring every single thing
about who we are.

747
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:47,976
But why?

748
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,587
I mean, what's all this for?

749
01:07:49,674 --> 01:07:51,415
Yu!

750
01:07:51,502 --> 01:07:52,720
Yu!

751
01:07:53,808 --> 01:07:55,723
We need to find
a way out of here.

752
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:57,160
OK.

753
01:08:34,762 --> 01:08:36,112
This way!

754
01:08:39,027 --> 01:08:41,639
That lying piece of shit.

755
01:08:41,726 --> 01:08:43,815
Uma! We've got to go!

756
01:08:47,384 --> 01:08:49,255
We got to go now!

757
01:08:49,342 --> 01:08:51,823
- Get them! Get them!
- Uma, now!

758
01:08:55,957 --> 01:08:58,221
Uma, now!

759
01:08:58,308 --> 01:09:01,528
Uma!

760
01:09:05,532 --> 01:09:06,707
Hey!

761
01:09:06,794 --> 01:09:08,144
No!

762
01:09:08,231 --> 01:09:09,667
Stop!

763
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,635
Open up, you punks!

764
01:09:23,246 --> 01:09:24,812
Open the door!

765
01:09:25,726 --> 01:09:27,685
Break it down!

766
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:43,788
Help us.

767
01:09:44,223 --> 01:09:47,357
Help us!

768
01:09:47,444 --> 01:09:49,576
Please, help us.
Our friend needs help!

769
01:09:49,663 --> 01:09:51,099
Girls, get the staff.

770
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,666
Looks like three little
rich girls

771
01:09:52,753 --> 01:09:53,928
just wandered into our pool.

772
01:09:54,015 --> 01:09:55,800
No!

773
01:09:55,887 --> 01:09:57,236
Who are you?

774
01:10:00,805 --> 01:10:02,154
We're your substitutes.

775
01:10:05,766 --> 01:10:06,985
What?

776
01:10:07,072 --> 01:10:09,683
You don't understand

777
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:12,338
how hard we've worked
to get here.

778
01:10:13,296 --> 01:10:15,123
While you...

779
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:16,603
eat cake

780
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:18,257
and pick flowers,

781
01:10:18,344 --> 01:10:20,520
we work.

782
01:10:20,607 --> 01:10:23,349
We've practiced
until we fainted.

783
01:10:24,698 --> 01:10:27,223
We've endured
dozens of surgeries.

784
01:10:28,659 --> 01:10:30,138
All...

785
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,879
to be like you.

786
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,970
To be better than you.

787
01:10:50,637 --> 01:10:52,248
You...

788
01:10:52,335 --> 01:10:54,989
you think you're
gonna replace me?

789
01:10:55,076 --> 01:10:57,078
You bet I will, darlin'.

790
01:10:57,165 --> 01:11:00,212
You don't understand
where we come from,

791
01:11:00,299 --> 01:11:02,214
what we've done to get here.

792
01:11:03,433 --> 01:11:05,609
For every single one of us,

793
01:11:05,696 --> 01:11:08,089
this is our only chance
at a decent life.

794
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:12,964
We were born out of your wars.

795
01:11:13,051 --> 01:11:15,140
We've had to grovel for food.

796
01:11:16,837 --> 01:11:20,537
You should at least enjoy
the life you've already had.

797
01:11:23,235 --> 01:11:25,281
- Yu.
- Yu.

798
01:11:25,368 --> 01:11:27,239
Yu, no. Yu!

799
01:11:27,326 --> 01:11:29,502
Yu! Yu!

800
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:35,378
Yu. Yu. Yu.

801
01:11:35,465 --> 01:11:37,771
No, no, no, no, no. No!

802
01:11:53,047 --> 01:11:56,268
Well, you got what you wanted.

803
01:11:56,355 --> 01:11:59,706
So I guess one of you is
gonna replace me, aren't you?

804
01:11:59,793 --> 01:12:01,229
Are you listening to me?

805
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:02,666
Are you here?

806
01:12:02,753 --> 01:12:04,494
Did they give you
hair like mine?

807
01:12:04,581 --> 01:12:05,843
Eyes like mine?

808
01:12:06,496 --> 01:12:07,888
My mouth?

809
01:12:07,975 --> 01:12:09,455
My skin?

810
01:12:09,542 --> 01:12:11,196
The scar on my leg?

811
01:12:18,725 --> 01:12:21,380
Well, there's one thing
they haven't given you.

812
01:12:27,995 --> 01:12:29,649
This is my father.

813
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,697
Well, take a good look at him,

814
01:12:33,784 --> 01:12:35,568
'cause he's dead.

815
01:12:35,655 --> 01:12:38,354
And the man who's paying
for you is to blame.

816
01:12:42,096 --> 01:12:44,664
You wanna be me?

817
01:12:44,751 --> 01:12:47,188
You have to carry that
around with you.

818
01:12:48,538 --> 01:12:49,843
Always.

819
01:12:56,894 --> 01:12:58,939
Do you believe
you're the only one

820
01:12:59,026 --> 01:13:00,463
with a story like that?

821
01:13:03,814 --> 01:13:05,816
You know, we have families, too.

822
01:13:05,903 --> 01:13:08,340
Uma, run! Go, just go!

823
01:13:08,427 --> 01:13:11,212
- Hey!
- Get them!

824
01:13:11,299 --> 01:13:12,692
Stop!

825
01:13:12,779 --> 01:13:13,867
Get 'em!

826
01:13:13,954 --> 01:13:15,173
Get them!

827
01:13:18,742 --> 01:13:21,005
Open the door! Open it!

828
01:13:21,092 --> 01:13:23,007
Break it down!

829
01:13:40,894 --> 01:13:42,896
- OK.
- OK.

830
01:13:51,688 --> 01:13:53,037
Come on.

831
01:13:57,345 --> 01:13:58,912
What is this?

832
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:52,052
It's OK.

833
01:14:52,792 --> 01:14:54,228
Keep going.

834
01:15:12,203 --> 01:15:13,247
Chloe?

835
01:15:13,334 --> 01:15:15,423
Uma!

836
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:17,991
Chloe!

837
01:15:18,078 --> 01:15:19,906
- Chloe, where are you?
- Uma!

838
01:16:27,495 --> 01:16:29,672
Uma!

839
01:16:32,196 --> 01:16:33,719
Uma!

840
01:17:07,448 --> 01:17:09,842
Uma!

841
01:17:09,929 --> 01:17:11,191
Chloe?

842
01:17:14,281 --> 01:17:15,456
Chloe.

843
01:17:31,603 --> 01:17:32,909
Uma.

844
01:17:43,789 --> 01:17:45,138
What are you?

845
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:48,881
I'm just like you.

846
01:17:48,968 --> 01:17:51,928
A nasty little thorn
in mother's side.

847
01:18:38,626 --> 01:18:40,454
At Mother's age,

848
01:18:40,541 --> 01:18:43,109
I can't exactly stop now, can I?

849
01:18:49,115 --> 01:18:51,422
Who'd want me then?

850
01:18:51,944 --> 01:18:53,163
Who'd...

851
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:55,252
want...

852
01:18:55,339 --> 01:18:56,557
me then?

853
01:19:12,791 --> 01:19:14,532
Leave her alone!

854
01:19:15,402 --> 01:19:17,230
I said leave her alone.

855
01:19:25,325 --> 01:19:26,718
Isn't this cute?

856
01:19:26,805 --> 01:19:28,720
A family reunion!

857
01:19:30,809 --> 01:19:33,290
That's my substitute, you idiot.

858
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:35,771
I'm the one you want.

859
01:19:38,861 --> 01:19:40,732
No, I'm the one you want.

860
01:19:40,819 --> 01:19:43,343
Don't listen,
she's lying to you!

861
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:45,911
- That's my substitute.
- I'm the one you're looking for.

862
01:19:45,998 --> 01:19:48,305
How can you not recognize me?
Don't listen to her.

863
01:19:48,392 --> 01:19:49,741
- It's me.
- Liar!

864
01:19:49,828 --> 01:19:51,612
- Liar!
- I'm the one you want!

865
01:19:51,699 --> 01:19:53,397
Enough!

866
01:19:55,225 --> 01:19:56,313
Now,

867
01:19:57,531 --> 01:20:00,317
which one are you?

868
01:20:01,709 --> 01:20:03,102
I am me.

869
01:21:45,639 --> 01:21:47,598
We're still missing
one substitute.

870
01:21:47,685 --> 01:21:48,904
Keep searching.

871
01:21:49,643 --> 01:21:50,775
Copy.

872
01:22:23,764 --> 01:22:24,852
Uma.

873
01:22:27,507 --> 01:22:28,682
Uma.

874
01:22:35,428 --> 01:22:37,256
She lied to me.

875
01:22:38,518 --> 01:22:41,260
She told me that you chose him.

876
01:22:41,347 --> 01:22:44,263
She told me that you
chose Son over me.

877
01:22:46,613 --> 01:22:48,702
How much did she pay you?

878
01:22:51,662 --> 01:22:53,142
I won't take it.

879
01:23:04,892 --> 01:23:07,286
All clear over there, partner?

880
01:23:13,292 --> 01:23:14,467
Partner?

881
01:23:21,909 --> 01:23:23,346
Yes, sir.

882
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:25,739
All clear.

883
01:24:03,864 --> 01:24:04,996
Here.

884
01:24:06,432 --> 01:24:08,217
This belongs to you.

885
01:24:14,092 --> 01:24:15,746
Thank you.

886
01:24:21,621 --> 01:24:23,406
What are you gonna do now?

887
01:24:26,278 --> 01:24:28,628
There's nothing left
where I came from.

888
01:24:30,761 --> 01:24:32,154
Your parents?

889
01:24:34,895 --> 01:24:37,811
I tried to take care of
my two little brothers,

890
01:24:37,898 --> 01:24:40,466
but sixteen hours a day
working in a factory,

891
01:24:40,553 --> 01:24:42,903
it wasn't enough.

892
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:45,515
This man came to our town and...

893
01:24:45,602 --> 01:24:47,082
offered me this job.

894
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:50,694
If you can call it a job.

895
01:24:50,781 --> 01:24:53,523
He promised me my brothers
would never go hungry again.

896
01:24:59,006 --> 01:25:02,358
I had to become somebody else
so I could survive.

897
01:25:04,447 --> 01:25:06,797
I had to become you.

898
01:25:12,846 --> 01:25:14,196
I'm sorry.

899
01:25:31,082 --> 01:25:32,562
What's your name?

900
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:36,479
Anna.

901
01:25:38,568 --> 01:25:40,744
It's nice to meet you, Anna.

902
01:25:46,489 --> 01:25:48,491
Sing it again, sweetheart!

903
01:25:50,623 --> 01:25:52,364
What a stunning bride.

904
01:25:52,451 --> 01:25:54,627
And what a stupendous wedding.

905
01:25:57,761 --> 01:26:00,198
Your daughter is the epitome
of Upper perfection.

906
01:26:00,285 --> 01:26:02,069
She's earned the life
ahead of her.

907
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:04,071
You must be so very proud.

908
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,595
Indeed.

909
01:26:05,682 --> 01:26:07,640
And here she is.

910
01:26:07,727 --> 01:26:10,165
He was heartbroken when you were
the only one who went missing

911
01:26:10,252 --> 01:26:12,036
after that disaster.

912
01:26:12,123 --> 01:26:14,647
Only a man in love
can suffer like that.

913
01:26:14,734 --> 01:26:16,649
You should feel fortunate.

914
01:26:16,736 --> 01:26:18,042
I do.

915
01:26:18,129 --> 01:26:19,957
Very much so.

916
01:26:20,044 --> 01:26:21,611
I just... can't imagine

917
01:26:21,698 --> 01:26:23,569
how difficult it must
have been for him.

918
01:26:23,656 --> 01:26:25,745
I mean, he's invested
so much in me.

919
01:26:28,618 --> 01:26:30,968
Smile, kid.

920
01:26:31,055 --> 01:26:33,927
You're giving it all
back to him now.

921
01:26:38,236 --> 01:26:41,370
Mr. Hingston is
expecting you upstairs.

922
01:26:41,457 --> 01:26:44,895
A husband shouldn't be
kept waiting any longer.

923
01:26:44,982 --> 01:26:48,594
That place works miracles.

924
01:26:48,681 --> 01:26:51,684
You could be
so difficult before.

925
01:26:51,771 --> 01:26:53,164
But now...

926
01:26:55,297 --> 01:26:58,082
it's as if that girl
never existed.

927
01:27:28,982 --> 01:27:30,984
Please, don't worry.

928
01:27:31,071 --> 01:27:32,334
I'll go.

929
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:40,097
Uma!

930
01:28:40,184 --> 01:28:41,359
Uma!

931
01:28:41,446 --> 01:28:44,667
Oh, baby, what happened?

Mm. Mm.

Mm.

4
00:01:52,764 --> 00:01:55,225
I had a beautiful dream.

5
00:01:56,518 --> 00:01:59,688
We had two little children.

6
00:02:01,064 --> 00:02:02,732
Twins.

7
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:08,279
If we have children,
would you like it if they were twins?

8
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:10,823
Mmm. Mm-hm.

9
00:02:10,824 --> 00:02:12,491
Yeah.

10
00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:13,785
Twins.

11
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,788
Sure, why not?

12
00:02:18,665 --> 00:02:20,166
One for each of us.

13
00:02:25,672 --> 00:02:26,965

Morning, Donny.

30
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:40,365
Ready to roll, Paterson?

31
00:05:40,366 --> 00:05:41,491
Yeah.

32
00:06:53,356 --> 00:06:55,650
Yeah, but you gotta
know more, tell me.

33
00:06:57,277 --> 00:07:01,238
Well, Hurricane Carter,
he was a famous boxer.

34
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:05,284
And he lived right back there.
Paterson, baby.

35
00:07:05,285 --> 00:07:08,370
He looked just like
Denzel Washington, too.

36
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:10,580
They locked him up.

37
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:12,082
Why'd they lock him up?

38
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,751
They say he shot some people up

39
00:07:14,752 --> 00:07:17,045
with a shotgun in a bar and all that.

40
00:07:17,046 --> 00:07:19,298
I know he didn't do it.

41
00:07:19,299 --> 00:07:21,300
Then they finally
let him out, right?

42
00:07:21,301 --> 00:07:24,594
Yo, years later, though. But yeah.

43
00:07:24,595 --> 00:07:27,306
You think before all that,
Hurricane Carter ever shot somebody?

44
00:07:27,307 --> 00:07:28,391
I don't know.

45
00:07:39,027 --> 00:07:40,777
What are you gonna
be for Halloween?

46
00:07:40,778 --> 00:07:42,988
My mom found this picture
on Instagram

47
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:46,658
of these kids, they were shadows.

48
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:49,328
So they crept up next to kids, other kids,

49
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:50,746
and they used to spook 'em out

50
00:07:50,747 --> 00:07:52,873
and look like shadows.

51
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:55,000
One year, I was actually a subway surfer.

52
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:56,752
You can buy that one?

53
00:07:56,753 --> 00:07:59,004
Um, no, I built it.

Because of the bake sale
this weekend, I thought that

90
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:01,186
if my cupcakes sell really well,

91
00:11:01,187 --> 00:11:04,272
it might be kind of a sign.

92
00:11:04,273 --> 00:11:06,358
Sign of what, honey?

93
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:08,527
My dream!

94
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:11,196
To have my own cupcake business, of
course.

95
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:13,532
Oh, that'd be nice.

96
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:21,665
- Thank you for dinner.
- You're welcome.

97
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,668
I made these myself. What do you think?

98
00:11:24,669 --> 00:11:26,920
Oooh, yeah. That's really good.

99
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:29,089
I painted them.

100
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,925
I like how all the circles are different.

101
00:11:35,096 --> 00:11:38,014
Was your sandwich for lunch OK?

102
00:11:38,015 --> 00:11:40,892
Yeah, it was
a really great sandwich.

103
00:11:40,893 --> 00:11:43,479
Good. I'm glad.

104
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:48,693
Did you get a little writing done?

105
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:53,990
I did, yeah.

You know, darling,

107
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:03,248
I really think you should do something
about those beautiful poems.

108
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:05,250
They should belong to the world, you know?

109
00:12:05,251 --> 00:12:08,461
The world?
Well, now you're trying to scare me.

110
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:12,465
I am not! I'm serious, you big dumbbell.

111

nice little nightly walk?

116

- Just remember.
- What?

117
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,956
Cupcakes. We could be rich from cupcakes.

119
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,877
I'm ready for that.

120
00:12:57,094 --> 00:12:58,262

OK, OK, I'm just asking.

153

world,</i>

170
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:50,553
<i>"so sober and furious and stubbornly ready</i>

171
00:17:50,554 --> 00:17:52,222
<i>"to burst into flame,</i>

172
00:17:54,099 --> 00:17:58,978
<i>"lighting, perhaps,
the cigarette of the woman you love</i>

173
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:01,731
<i>"for the first time,
and it was never really</i>

174
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:03,692
<i>"the same after that.</i>

175
00:18:06,362 --> 00:18:08,489
<i>"All this will we give you."</i>

176
00:18:10,616 --> 00:18:12,992
<i>That is what you gave me.</i>

177
00:18:12,993 --> 00:18:16,037
<i>I become the cigarette</i>

178
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:20,375
<i>and you the match or...</i>

179
00:18:20,376 --> 00:18:24,837
<i>I the match and you the cigarette,</i>

180
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:28,424
<i>blazing with kisses...</i>

181
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:31,512
<i>that smoulder toward heaven.</i>

182
00:18:33,764 --> 00:18:35,181
Morning, Donny.

183
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:37,101
- Ready to roll, Paterson?
- Yeah.

184
00:18:41,522 --> 00:18:43,439
Everything OK?

185
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,567
Well, now that you ask, no, not really.

186
00:18:46,568 --> 00:18:48,528
My kid needs braces on her teeth.

187
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:50,321
My car needs a transmission job.

188
00:18:50,322 --> 00:18:51,864
My wife wants me to take her to Florida.

189
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:53,658
But I'm behind on the mortgage payments.

190
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:55,368
My uncle called from India
and he needs money

191
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:57,328
for my niece's wedding,
and I got this strange rash

192
00:18:57,329 --> 00:19:00,081
on my back - you name it, brother.

193
00:19:00,082 --> 00:19:02,667
- How 'bout you?
- I'm OK.

194
00:19:02,668 --> 00:19:05,378
- OK, well, have a nice day.
- OK, you too.

195
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:06,922
Yeah. I doubt it.

196
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:28,169
You know the...
that cute little brunette

197
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,712
from the, uh, from the doughnut place?

198
00:20:29,713 --> 00:20:31,589
Yeah, yeah. She's pretty hot.

199
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,716
Yeah. Turns out
she lives in my neighbourhood.

200
00:20:33,717 --> 00:20:35,259
Yeah. The other day,
I come home from work.

201
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,220
I'm, you know, tired,
I'm having a beer, all right?

202
00:20:37,221 --> 00:20:38,805
I hear a knock at the door.

203
00:20:38,806 --> 00:20:41,682
- I open it and it's her!
- Really? Oh, man!

204
00:20:41,683 --> 00:20:43,518
She is all made up,
looking, like, really good.

205
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:44,894
So what happened?

206
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:46,604
Well, we just talked there at the door

207
00:20:46,605 --> 00:20:49,732
for like a while, you know,
and she was, like, laughing a lot.

208
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:53,861
She was, you know,
making eye contact, you know...

209
00:20:53,862 --> 00:20:56,656
- I... She wanted to hang out.
- So then what?

210
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:59,450
Well, we just, you know, we had,
like, a really nice conversation

211
00:20:59,451 --> 00:21:00,785
and then, you know,

212
00:21:00,786 --> 00:21:03,496
I-I-I was really tired and everything.

213
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:06,624
I hadn't really showered or anything,
so she left.

214
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:07,792
She left?

215
00:21:07,793 --> 00:21:10,253
Yeah, but you know...

216
00:21:10,254 --> 00:21:11,921
I mean, I know what she wanted. Right?

217
00:21:11,922 --> 00:21:15,007
Yeah. Yeah, for-for sure, Jimmy.

218
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:16,634
These females are outta control.

219
00:21:16,635 --> 00:21:18,178
- Right.
- You know?

220
00:21:22,975 --> 00:21:24,350
Yeah, yeah.

221
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:25,894
They're out of control.

222
00:21:33,861 --> 00:21:37,780
Yeah. Well, I-I had a similar thing
happen last week, man.

223
00:21:37,781 --> 00:21:39,448
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah, check this out.

224
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:41,742
I'm at Larry's barbecue party
on Sunday, right?

225
00:21:41,743 --> 00:21:44,954
- Larry had a barbecue?
- Yeah, the barbecue party.

226
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:47,999
And, uh, I'm just standing out there
on the deck, right?

227
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,375
And I'd already eaten a lot,

228
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:51,377
and I'm just having a beer, right?

229
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:55,506
And you know that blonde friend
of Larry's girlfriend, um, Rita?

230
00:21:55,507 --> 00:21:57,133
- I'm not sure you met her.
- I don't know Rita.

231
00:21:57,134 --> 00:21:59,635
Well, she is, like, super hot!
Right?

232
00:21:59,636 --> 00:22:01,387
- Oh, yeah.
- And just like, stacked too.

233
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:04,056
Just beautiful curves.
Like an animal.

234
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:05,975
And, you know, she comes over to me

235
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:07,852
and she asks me what I'm doing later!

236
00:22:07,853 --> 00:22:10,271
- All right.
- Yeah, right?

237
00:22:10,272 --> 00:22:11,981
Yeah, so we talk for a little while.

238
00:22:11,982 --> 00:22:14,817
And, uh, she was like,
really flirtatious too, man.

239
00:22:14,818 --> 00:22:16,277
- OK.
- You know. Yeah.

240
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:19,488
And finished my beer,
and, oh, man, you know,

241
00:22:19,489 --> 00:22:21,574
I had to get up early
for work the next morning

242
00:22:21,575 --> 00:22:22,617
and all that, so...

243
00:22:22,618 --> 00:22:23,868
- You split?
- Yeah.

244
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:25,620
Yeah.

245
00:22:25,621 --> 00:22:27,371
But it was... it was cool, though.

246
00:22:27,372 --> 00:22:32,376
Uh, I mean, I knew
exactly what she wanted, right.

247
00:22:32,377 --> 00:22:35,255
And I got her number, too.
She gave me her number.

248
00:22:35,964 --> 00:22:38,716
So did you call her?

249
00:22:38,717 --> 00:22:40,927
No, not yet. No. Mm-mm.

250
00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:42,929
No, cos I figured
I'd wait a couple of days.

251
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,263
- All right.
- You know.

252
00:22:44,264 --> 00:22:47,600
- OK.
- But I should call her, though.

253
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:49,061
- Yeah.
- I should.

254
00:22:53,982 --> 00:22:56,359
You, uh, you workin'
late tonight?

255
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,944
Yeah.

256
00:22:57,945 --> 00:23:00,239
- Yeah, I need the overtime.
- Yeah, me too.

257
00:24:19,234 --> 00:24:22,111
<i>Another One.</i>

258
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:24,322
<i>When you're a child,</i>

259
00:24:24,323 --> 00:24:26,907
<i>you learn there are three dimensions -</i>

260
00:24:26,908 --> 00:24:31,620
<i>height, width and depth.</i>

261
00:24:31,621 --> 00:24:34,457
<i>Like a shoebox.</i>

262
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,917
<i>Then later, you hear</i>

263
00:24:36,918 --> 00:24:40,087
<i>there's a fourth dimension -</i>

264
00:24:40,088 --> 00:24:41,089
<i>time.</i>

265
00:24:42,507 --> 00:24:44,300
<i>Hmm.</i>

266
00:24:44,301 --> 00:24:46,302
<i>Then some say</i>

267
00:24:46,303 --> 00:24:48,888
<i>there can be five...</i>

268
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:51,808
<i>six, seven...</i>

269
00:24:53,518 --> 00:24:55,853
Are you OK down here, honey?

270
00:24:55,854 --> 00:24:58,314
Uh, yeah.

271
00:24:58,315 --> 00:24:59,816
Yeah, I'm finished for now.

272
00:25:25,217 --> 00:25:27,051
Now, darling...

273
00:25:27,052 --> 00:25:29,136
you have two important things
to talk about before

274
00:25:29,137 --> 00:25:31,430
you and Marvin go out for your walk.

275
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:34,183
Oh, OK. Two important things.

276
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:36,310
One's about you and one is about me.

277
00:25:36,311 --> 00:25:39,230
OK.

278
00:25:39,231 --> 00:25:43,275
One is about your writing,
and you know what it is.

279
00:25:43,276 --> 00:25:44,819
Oh.

280
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,905
Please. Please make some copies.

281
00:25:47,906 --> 00:25:51,158
You know that I know
that your poetry is really, really good.

282
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:52,993
And that some day, you might just decide

283
00:25:52,994 --> 00:25:55,371
to let the world get to read it.

284
00:25:55,372 --> 00:25:57,415
- Laura, I really don't...
- No.

285
00:25:57,416 --> 00:26:01,252
Look me in the eye for a second.
Look me in the eye.

286
00:26:02,337 --> 00:26:04,381
You are a great poet.

287
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,177
All your poems
are still in that one notebook.

288
00:26:10,178 --> 00:26:11,220
Your secret notebook.

289
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:13,222
My secret notebook, yeah.

290
00:26:13,223 --> 00:26:15,933
So will you finally just go

291
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:17,560
to the Xerox place or something?

292
00:26:17,561 --> 00:26:20,396
Please. Just do it.

293
00:26:20,397 --> 00:26:22,982
It would take about ten minutes
to make a copy

294
00:26:22,983 --> 00:26:24,859
of your entire secret notebook.

295
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,569
Well, I think it'd take
a little longer than ten minutes.

296
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,155
OK. OK. 15 or 20 minutes.

297
00:26:29,156 --> 00:26:31,282
I would even do it for you.

298
00:26:31,283 --> 00:26:35,035
Baby, I've been asking
for a year, at least.

299
00:26:35,036 --> 00:26:36,121
Yeah, you have.

300
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,625
Well, maybe I can do it this weekend.

301
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,754
You promise?

302
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:50,092
Y-Yeah, OK.

303
00:26:50,093 --> 00:26:53,762
Thank you. I'll feel so much better.

304
00:26:58,685 --> 00:27:01,353
What was the...
What was the thing about you?

305
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:03,063
Well, it's not

306
00:27:03,064 --> 00:27:06,525
as important as that, but...

307
00:27:06,526 --> 00:27:08,861
I've been thinkin' about music lately,

308
00:27:08,862 --> 00:27:11,489
and, and then I saw this guitar

309
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:14,867
on YouTube that Esteban demonstrates.

310
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:18,579
And it's in black and white.
It's called the Harlequin.

311
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,582
And it's so fantastic that
I think I really need

312
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:24,168
to learn to play the guitar.

313
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:26,086
And it comes with... comes with lessons

314
00:27:26,087 --> 00:27:27,796
and DVDs and instructions,

315
00:27:27,797 --> 00:27:30,132
so in no time at all,
I could be playing away

316
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:32,551
and realising my dream.

317
00:27:32,552 --> 00:27:34,428
I-I... Which dream is this?

318
00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:38,265
Don't be silly. To be a country singer.

319
00:27:38,266 --> 00:27:41,435
Maybe even a big star,
like one of the greats

320
00:27:41,436 --> 00:27:44,230
like Tammy Wynette

321
00:27:44,231 --> 00:27:46,815
or... or Patsy Cline.

322
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:49,735
And I can wear black and white

323
00:27:49,736 --> 00:27:53,113
and have my own distinctive style.

324
00:27:53,114 --> 00:27:56,242
I have a very strong visual style,
as you know.

325
00:27:56,243 --> 00:27:57,953
Yes, you... Yes, you do. Yes, you do.

326
00:27:59,538 --> 00:28:01,164
Yeah, definitely.

327
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:05,501
Well, y-you really need this guitar?

328
00:28:05,502 --> 00:28:08,379
Oh, yes. And they say it's so important

329
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,006
to learn new things as you get older.

330
00:28:11,007 --> 00:28:16,136
And, well, music, you just don't know
where it could lead.

331
00:28:16,137 --> 00:28:21,308
And it's only a few hundred dollars.

332
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:23,686
I know it's expensive, but we can pay

333
00:28:23,687 --> 00:28:26,731
a little each month
and free two-day shipping.

334
00:28:28,316 --> 00:28:30,109
A few hundred dollars?

335
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:34,113
It comes with lessons,
instruction books, a tuner

336
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:38,784
and, um, extra strings
and a hard case and everything.

337
00:28:38,785 --> 00:28:42,330
Well, I think, um, maybe...

338
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:49,211
Maybe you could be, uh,
a country singer some day.

339
00:28:49,212 --> 00:28:50,254
- Really?
- Yeah.

340
00:28:50,255 --> 00:28:51,922
I wouldn't put it past you.

341
00:28:51,923 --> 00:28:54,592
Oh, honey, thank you!

342
00:28:54,593 --> 00:28:57,553
Thank you. I love you.

343
00:29:00,265 --> 00:29:05,185
And I love you too, handsome.

344
00:29:05,186 --> 00:29:07,730
Who's going out with Daddy?

345
00:29:07,731 --> 00:29:10,774
Who is my good boy going out with Daddy?

346
00:29:10,775 --> 00:29:12,568
Marvin's going out with Daddy.

347
00:29:12,569 --> 00:29:15,946
Yes. Who is going out with Daddy?

348
00:29:15,947 --> 00:29:18,533
Yes, good boy. Good boy.

349
00:29:32,672 --> 00:29:35,342
Oh, look at that. Look at that right there.

350
00:29:37,427 --> 00:29:40,095
That's cute, right?
That's an actual creature.

351
00:29:48,813 --> 00:29:50,314
Hey, yo!

352
00:29:50,315 --> 00:29:53,651
Yo, my man, let me holler
at you for a minute!

353
00:29:53,652 --> 00:29:55,986
Hey, yo, that's
a English bulldog, right?

354
00:29:55,987 --> 00:29:58,405
Uh, yeah.

355
00:29:58,406 --> 00:30:01,158
Yo, I told you, man.
Them dogs are poppin' right now.

356
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:03,410
Yo, that dog mad expensive, right?

357
00:30:03,411 --> 00:30:05,704
Yeah, well...

358
00:30:05,705 --> 00:30:07,247
expensive to feed.

359
00:30:07,248 --> 00:30:08,499
You hear this guy, yo?

360
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,084
Nah, I feel you, though, but, man,

361
00:30:10,085 --> 00:30:13,003
dogs like that get jacked,
y'know what I mean?

362
00:30:13,004 --> 00:30:16,340
Like, dog-jacked, my G. You feel me?

363
00:30:17,384 --> 00:30:20,387
Oooh, hear that little guy, man?

364
00:30:22,472 --> 00:30:24,390
Dog-jacked?

365
00:30:24,391 --> 00:30:26,141
Well, it gives me something
to look forward to, then, I guess.

366
00:30:26,142 --> 00:30:28,435
All right, money.

367
00:30:28,436 --> 00:30:30,187
Hey, yo, be safe out here, a'right?

368
00:30:30,188 --> 00:30:32,357
And cuff that dog. It's real out here, bro.

369
00:30:33,066 --> 00:30:34,192
All right.

370
00:30:43,535 --> 00:30:45,495
I'm gonna cuff you, Marvin.

371
00:30:57,173 --> 00:30:59,551
OK, Marvin. Don't get dog-jacked.

372
00:31:09,018 --> 00:31:11,353
Paterson, I got something weird.

373
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:15,190
- Maybe for the wall. Maybe...
- What's this?

374
00:31:15,191 --> 00:31:17,443
You know this cat? Iggy Pop?

375
00:31:17,444 --> 00:31:19,445
Oh, yeah, Iggy and the Stooges.

376
00:31:19,446 --> 00:31:22,364
"Paterson, New Jersey
Teenage Girls' Club

377
00:31:22,365 --> 00:31:25,576
"names singer Iggy Pop world's sexiest
man."

378
00:31:25,577 --> 00:31:27,871
- "June, 1970."
- Does it go up?

379
00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:32,541
Uh, yeah. Sure, why not? It's Paterson.

380
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:34,126
All right.

381
00:31:34,127 --> 00:31:37,714
All right. Iggy Pop on the wall.

382
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,883
- Iggy.
- Hey, Doc?

383
00:31:40,884 --> 00:31:42,509
Who's that, who's that,
right next to Uncle Floyd

384
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,261
holding the guitar?

385
00:31:44,262 --> 00:31:46,388
I finally got you. Well, that's new.

386
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:48,932
But that's Uncle Floyd Vivino's
little brother Jimmy.

387
00:31:48,933 --> 00:31:51,435
He's a band leader
on the Conan O'Brien show.

388
00:31:51,436 --> 00:31:53,396
That's a little past my bedtime.

389
00:31:54,856 --> 00:31:56,982
Hey, Marie. Another ginger ale?

390
00:31:56,983 --> 00:32:00,152
- Thanks, Doc.
- You know Paterson, right?

391
00:32:00,153 --> 00:32:03,405
Umm, not really, but...
we've seen each other.

392
00:32:03,406 --> 00:32:06,116
- Hey, Paterson.
- Hey-hey-hey, Marie.

393
00:32:06,117 --> 00:32:08,952
- You drive the bus, right?
- Yeah, I do.

394
00:32:08,953 --> 00:32:12,080
Your name really Paterson,
or they just nickname you that?

395
00:32:12,081 --> 00:32:16,460
Uh, no, my real name is Paterson.

396
00:32:16,461 --> 00:32:17,711
Well, that's kind of crazy, right?

397
00:32:17,712 --> 00:32:19,756
Yeah. Right.

398
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:23,551
Oh, shit.

399
00:32:25,678 --> 00:32:27,387
Everett still not gettin' it.

400
00:32:27,388 --> 00:32:29,223
Not yet, the numbskull.

401
00:32:29,224 --> 00:32:32,267
I've been breaking up with him
for two weeks now.

402
00:32:32,268 --> 00:32:33,727
What am I gonna do?

403
00:32:33,728 --> 00:32:35,479
Marie, baby, I need to talk to you.

404
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,688
- No!
- Please.

405
00:32:36,689 --> 00:32:38,190
Just talk to me for a few minutes.

406
00:32:38,191 --> 00:32:40,359
No, Everett. We've talked enough.

407
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,445
- More than enough.
- Please.

408
00:32:49,536 --> 00:32:51,621
- Hey, Paterson.
- Hey, Everett.

409
00:32:53,957 --> 00:32:55,124
Thanks, Doc.

410
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,476
Man, what would you do?

411
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,313
You love somebody...

412
00:33:18,314 --> 00:33:22,192
more than anything
in the whole damn world.

413
00:33:22,193 --> 00:33:25,779
You... worship her.

414
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,324
You don't wanna be alive without her

415
00:33:29,325 --> 00:33:33,997
and... she says she doesn't want you.

416
00:33:35,665 --> 00:33:37,542
You're just...

417
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:41,963
dirt.

418
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:49,804
Damn, brother. You should be an actor.

419
00:33:52,932 --> 00:33:55,351
I am an actor.

420
00:34:05,904 --> 00:34:10,490
Oh, yeah, that's... that's real funny.

421
00:34:10,491 --> 00:34:14,578
A man dying of heartbreak.
That... that's hilarious.

422
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:19,250
No. We are sympathetic.

423
00:34:20,877 --> 00:34:24,464
Have another drink, Everett, on the house.

424
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,718
Thanks.

425
00:35:52,051 --> 00:35:53,094
Good morning.

426
00:36:04,063 --> 00:36:06,816
- You up?
- Uh-uh.

427
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,018
<i>Another One.</i>

428
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:44,728
<i>When you're a child,</i>

429
00:36:44,729 --> 00:36:47,272
<i>you learn there are three dimensions -</i>

430
00:36:47,273 --> 00:36:49,817
<i>height, width, and depth.</i>

431
00:36:51,152 --> 00:36:52,986
<i>Like a shoebox.</i>

432
00:36:52,987 --> 00:36:56,239
<i>Then, later, you hear
there's a fourth dimension -</i>

433
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,117
<i>time.</i>

434
00:37:00,161 --> 00:37:01,745
<i>Hmm...</i>

435
00:37:01,746 --> 00:37:06,167
<i>Then some say
there can be five, six, seven...</i>

436
00:37:08,753 --> 00:37:10,712
<i>I knock off work,</i>

437
00:37:10,713 --> 00:37:13,507
<i>have a beer at the bar.</i>

438
00:37:13,508 --> 00:37:16,803
<i>I look down at the glass and feel glad.</i>

439
00:37:42,662 --> 00:37:44,462
All right, watch out,
watch out, watch out...

440
00:38:30,793 --> 00:38:32,252
<i>Poem.</i>

441
00:38:32,253 --> 00:38:34,004
<i>I'm in the house.</i>

442
00:38:34,005 --> 00:38:36,673
<i>It's nice out.</i>

443
00:38:36,674 --> 00:38:38,091
<i>Warm.</i>

444
00:38:38,092 --> 00:38:41,469
<i>Sun on cold snow.</i>

445
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,847
<i>First day of spring</i>

446
00:38:43,848 --> 00:38:45,558
<i>or last of winter.</i>

447
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:49,269
<i>My legs run up the stairs</i>

448
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,646
<i>and out the door,</i>

449
00:38:51,647 --> 00:38:55,026
<i>my top half here writing.</i>

450
00:39:26,891 --> 00:39:29,976
- Hello, darling!
- Hello, honey.

451
00:39:29,977 --> 00:39:32,605
- I'm painting!
- Hello, Marvin.

452
00:39:34,523 --> 00:39:36,192
I see that.

453
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:42,323
What do you think?

454
00:39:44,075 --> 00:39:46,118
Doesn't it make everything more
interesting?

455
00:39:47,995 --> 00:39:50,873
- Yeah, it's very interesting.
- How was your day?

456
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:53,793
Eh, the usual.

457
00:39:56,587 --> 00:39:57,963
Get any writing done?

458
00:39:57,964 --> 00:39:59,882
I did, a little, yeah.

459
00:40:02,843 --> 00:40:04,595
I'm working on a poem for you.

460
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:10,558
A love poem?

461
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:13,436
Yeah, I guess if it's for you,
it's a love poem.

462
00:40:13,437 --> 00:40:17,857
It's kind of inspired by our,
uh, Ohio Blue Tip Matches.

463
00:40:17,858 --> 00:40:19,359
Really?

464
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,611
Does it mention the little megaphone shape

465
00:40:21,612 --> 00:40:23,113
the letters make?

466
00:40:23,114 --> 00:40:26,157
Y-Yeah. Actually, it does.

467
00:40:26,158 --> 00:40:28,243
How beautiful.

468
00:40:28,244 --> 00:40:30,246
I can't wait to read it when it's done.

469
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:36,418
I also painted new shower curtains.
You should see them.

470
00:40:36,419 --> 00:40:37,962
Oh, OK.

471
00:40:40,923 --> 00:40:43,008
You know what else I did today?

472
00:40:43,009 --> 00:40:44,718
You, uh, planted an unusual

473
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:46,177
vegetable garden in the back yard?

474
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:48,930
No, silly! That you have
to do in the spring.

475
00:40:48,931 --> 00:40:50,890
- Oh.
- No, I ordered my present

476
00:40:50,891 --> 00:40:53,101
that's from you.

477
00:40:53,102 --> 00:40:54,811
P-present that's from me? What?

478
00:40:54,812 --> 00:40:57,689
The guitar! The Esteban Harlequin model.

479
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,065
- Oh.
- I'm so excited.

480
00:40:59,066 --> 00:41:00,650
It comes in two days.

481
00:41:00,651 --> 00:41:03,653
I didn't get to speak to Esteban
on the phone, though.

482
00:41:03,654 --> 00:41:06,072
Well, I'm sure he's really busy, honey.

483
00:41:06,073 --> 00:41:09,367
Don't make fun of me.
Hey, look out, though,

484
00:41:09,368 --> 00:41:12,078
cos Nashville, here I come!

485
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,913
Look out, Nashville!

486
00:41:13,914 --> 00:41:15,832
I'll get dinner ready!

487
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:18,001

- What is it?
- Quinoa!

489
00:41:20,671 --> 00:41:24,257
It's like a grain, sort of like couscous,

490
00:41:24,258 --> 00:41:25,759
but different.

491
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,844
I read that it came from the ancient Incas.

492
00:41:27,845 --> 00:41:29,971
A-And it's really good for you.

493
00:41:29,972 --> 00:41:31,182
Oh.

494
00:41:35,269 --> 00:41:37,355

Hey, pugsley. What're you lookin' at?

00:42:47,258 --> 00:42:48,967
Ah, I'm guessin' this is your

human ball-and-chain, right, pimpin'?

518
00:42:51,095 --> 00:42:52,345
Yeah, sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop,

519
00:42:52,346 --> 00:42:54,806
but I think it's something really
interesting that you're working on.

520
00:42:54,807 --> 00:42:56,641
Yeah. I'm still workin' on it, you know.

521
00:42:56,642 --> 00:42:59,436
I'm trying to figure out how...
how to spit it out.

522
00:42:59,437 --> 00:43:02,105
But thanks, I really appreciate that.

523
00:43:02,106 --> 00:43:04,732
Your laboratory?

524
00:43:04,733 --> 00:43:07,986
Wherever it hits me is where it's gonna be.

525
00:43:07,987 --> 00:43:10,989
Ah, well, good luck. Thank you.

526
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:13,908
Yeah. Thank you. Appreciate it.

527
00:43:13,909 --> 00:43:15,910
Later, pimpin'!

528
00:43:15,911 --> 00:43:18,456
A'ight! Peace!

529

♪ Just call me Paul Lawrence Dunbar ♪

530
00:43:42,146 --> 00:43:44,230
All right, sit.

531
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,187
...he comes back with a shotgun.

532
00:44:24,188 --> 00:44:26,564
Now the bear comes over,
taps him on the shoulder,

533
00:44:26,565 --> 00:44:29,901
knocks the shotgun out the way,
and does the same thing.

534
00:44:29,902 --> 00:44:31,361
So he's sittin' like this,
look at this bear.

535
00:44:31,362 --> 00:44:33,863
- He does not go back.
- Well, he goes back.

536
00:44:33,864 --> 00:44:37,200
First, he goes out and gets a bazooka,
puts the bazooka on his shoulder.

537
00:44:37,201 --> 00:44:39,452
He walks out there, the bear comes up,

538
00:44:39,453 --> 00:44:42,622
taps him on the shoulders and says...
you don't come here.

539
00:46:22,723 --> 00:46:26,310
I like how you smell
when you come home at night.

540
00:46:29,063 --> 00:46:31,190
- What do I smell like?
- Mmm.

541
00:46:33,108 --> 00:46:36,111
You smell faintly of...

542
00:46:37,655 --> 00:46:39,531
of beer.

543
00:46:57,841 --> 00:46:59,551
Mmm.

544
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,898
How do you say his name
again? It's like Gae-tan...

545
00:49:18,899 --> 00:49:21,150
<i>- </i> It's Gaetano Bresci.
- That sounds interesting.

546
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:24,403
Yeah, he, um, he co-founded
this anarchist newspaper here

547
00:49:24,404 --> 00:49:26,823
in Paterson, but it was in Italian, um,

548
00:49:26,824 --> 00:49:29,116
called <i>La Questione Sociale.</i>

549
00:49:29,117 --> 00:49:31,536
<i>- La Questione Sociale.</i>
- Yeah.

550
00:49:31,537 --> 00:49:33,871
He was born in Italy,
but he lived here.

551
00:49:33,872 --> 00:49:36,499
He was a weaver, an anarchist weaver.

552
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,460
This was in the 1890s.

553
00:49:39,461 --> 00:49:41,754
And at that time in Italy,
people were starving.

554
00:49:41,755 --> 00:49:43,965
When they demonstrated,
this Italian general

555
00:49:43,966 --> 00:49:46,717
had them fired upon with,
like, muskets and cannons,

556
00:49:46,718 --> 00:49:49,512
which, of course,
resulted in a bloody massacre

557
00:49:49,513 --> 00:49:51,639
with, like, a hundred people dead.

558
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,516
Was Gaetano Bresci there?

559
00:49:53,517 --> 00:49:55,518
No, he was here in Paterson.

560
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:57,812
But when he heard that the King of Italy,

561
00:49:57,813 --> 00:49:59,438
King Umberto the First,

562
00:49:59,439 --> 00:50:00,857
decorated this fucking general

563
00:50:00,858 --> 00:50:03,276
for bravely defending his royal house,

564
00:50:03,277 --> 00:50:05,361
Gaetano Bresci went over to Italy somehow

565
00:50:05,362 --> 00:50:08,698
and he shot Umberto the First
four times with a revolver.

566
00:50:08,699 --> 00:50:10,908
Whoa. Did they kill Bresci?

567
00:50:10,909 --> 00:50:14,203
No, they captured him
and they put him on trial with, like,

568
00:50:14,204 --> 00:50:16,080
a famous anarchist lawyer and everything.

569
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:18,249
But since there was
no capital punishment in Italy

570
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:22,295
at that time, like 1900,
I mean... nor is there now.

571
00:50:22,296 --> 00:50:23,838
You can't be a member
of the European Union

572
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,673
if you practise capital punishment, of
course.

573
00:50:25,674 --> 00:50:28,009
- Yeah, not like here.
- Yeah.

574
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:31,554
Anyway, they sent Gaetano Bresci
to, like, this prison island

575
00:50:31,555 --> 00:50:34,599
where they put all the other anarchists,
and after, like, a year,

576
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,809
he was found dead in his prison cell.

577
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:38,561
Murdered?

578
00:50:38,562 --> 00:50:40,813
Well, yeah,
most likely by the guards.

579
00:50:40,814 --> 00:50:43,858
But, there's a possibility
that he committed suicide.

580
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:45,986
Whoa, Gaetano Bresci.

581
00:50:49,907 --> 00:50:52,992
Do you think there are any other anarchists
still around in Paterson?

582
00:50:52,993 --> 00:50:56,412
You mean besides us? Not likely.

583
00:50:56,413 --> 00:50:57,872
Hey, what time is your first class?

584
00:50:57,873 --> 00:50:59,373
It's at 10:00.

00:50:59,374 --> 00:51:01,293

You OK?

611
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:49,752
Well, since you asked, no, not really.

612
00:53:49,753 --> 00:53:51,045
My mother-in-law is moving in.

613
00:53:51,046 --> 00:53:53,047
The cat got diagnosed with cat diabetes.

614
00:53:53,048 --> 00:53:55,758
And the medicine,
you know, it's all so expensive.

615
00:53:55,759 --> 00:53:57,843
And now, my daughter started
taking violin lessons

616
00:53:57,844 --> 00:54:00,137
and I'm losing my mind
with the sound of that.

617
00:54:00,138 --> 00:54:03,557
What can I say, Paterson?

618
00:54:03,558 --> 00:54:06,560
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, just my burden, I guess.

619
00:54:06,561 --> 00:54:10,397
- My particular burden.
- OK.

620
00:54:10,398 --> 00:54:12,234
I'll see you tomorrow.

621
00:54:46,434 --> 00:54:49,603
Excuse me. Are you OK here, all alone?

622
00:54:49,604 --> 00:54:52,690
I'm fine. I'm just waiting
for my mom and my sister.

623
00:54:52,691 --> 00:54:55,276
She's upstairs,
in that building over there.

624
00:54:55,277 --> 00:54:58,779
Do you mind if I sit down
till your mom comes down?

625
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,197
Sure.

626
00:55:00,198 --> 00:55:01,658
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

627
00:55:03,285 --> 00:55:05,995
- Are you a bus driver?
- Yeah.

628
00:55:05,996 --> 00:55:10,040
Do you ever drive
one of those accordion buses?

629
00:55:10,041 --> 00:55:12,752
Articulated.

630
00:55:14,713 --> 00:55:16,964
Accordion.

631
00:55:16,965 --> 00:55:19,508
No, I just drive the regular ones.

632
00:55:19,509 --> 00:55:20,968
Did you ever drive a fire truck?

633
00:55:20,969 --> 00:55:23,304
No, just, uh, buses and cars,

634
00:55:23,305 --> 00:55:28,810
and, uh, I drove a big truck
a few times, but, uh, that's it.

635
00:55:39,029 --> 00:55:43,073
Are you, uh, interested in poetry?

636
00:55:43,074 --> 00:55:44,909
- Uh, actually, I am, kind of.
- Really?

637
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:47,786
- Yeah.
- I write poetry.

638
00:55:47,787 --> 00:55:50,081
I keep it all in this notebook.

639
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,167
Secret notebook.

640
00:55:53,168 --> 00:55:55,753
- Oh, you're a poet.
- Yeah.

641
00:55:55,754 --> 00:55:57,588
That's great.

642
00:55:57,589 --> 00:56:01,050
- Would you like to hear one?
- Sure, sure.

643
00:56:01,051 --> 00:56:04,261
It doesn't really rhyme, though.

644
00:56:04,262 --> 00:56:06,222
That's OK. I kind of like them
better when they don't.

645
00:56:06,223 --> 00:56:07,848
Yeah, me too.

646
00:56:07,849 --> 00:56:12,102
OK. This one's called "Water Falls".

647
00:56:12,103 --> 00:56:14,814
Two words, though, like that.

648
00:56:17,567 --> 00:56:20,277
"Water Falls", OK.

649
00:56:20,278 --> 00:56:22,112
OK.

650
00:56:22,113 --> 00:56:23,906
"Water Falls".

651
00:56:23,907 --> 00:56:26,242
"Water falls from the bright air.

652
00:56:26,243 --> 00:56:28,410
"It falls like hair,

653
00:56:28,411 --> 00:56:32,164
"falling across a young girl's shoulders.

654
00:56:32,165 --> 00:56:33,749
"Water falls,

655
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:36,252
"making pools in the asphalt,

656
00:56:36,253 --> 00:56:40,339
"dirty mirrors with clouds
and buildings inside.

657
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:42,633
"It falls on the roof of my house.

658
00:56:42,634 --> 00:56:45,595
"It falls on my mother, and on my hair.

659
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:49,307
"Most people call it rain."

660
00:56:52,435 --> 00:56:54,353
That's a beautiful poem.

661
00:56:54,354 --> 00:56:56,647
- You really liked it?
- Yeah, I really do.

662
00:56:56,648 --> 00:56:58,065
I think it's beautiful.

663
00:56:58,066 --> 00:57:01,193
"Water Falls". Thank you.

664
00:57:01,194 --> 00:57:04,029
It doesn't rhyme exactly.

665
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:07,241
No, but the first two lines do,
in a nice way.

666
00:57:07,242 --> 00:57:09,910
And some nice little
internal rhymes too, I think.

667
00:57:09,911 --> 00:57:11,329
Internal rhymes.

668
00:57:12,956 --> 00:57:14,958
Oh, my mom's done.

669
00:57:16,376 --> 00:57:18,712
That's my sister. We're twins.

670
00:57:22,007 --> 00:57:24,216
It was nice to meet you.

671
00:57:24,217 --> 00:57:26,093
Nice to meet you too. Nice to meet a...

672
00:57:26,094 --> 00:57:28,220
nice to meet a real poet.

673
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:35,811
Do you like Emily Dickinson?

674
00:57:35,812 --> 00:57:38,439
I do, yeah. She's one of my favourites.

675
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:42,027
Awesome, a bus driver
that likes Emily Dickinson.

676
00:57:57,334 --> 00:58:00,920
"Water falls from the bright air,

677
00:58:05,967 --> 00:58:07,927
<i>"falls like hair,</i>

678
00:58:09,971 --> 00:58:12,640
<i>"falling across a young girl's shoulder."</i>

679
00:58:24,069 --> 00:58:26,988
I'm so excited to see
what you'll think.

680
00:58:30,283 --> 00:58:34,161
Some fresh basil.
I grew it myself on the windowsill.

681
00:58:34,162 --> 00:58:36,205
W-we're having pie for dinner?

682
00:58:36,206 --> 00:58:39,208
Yeah, but a dinner pie.

683
00:58:39,209 --> 00:58:40,502
Oh.

684
00:58:42,087 --> 00:58:44,421
What do you think's inside?

685
00:58:44,422 --> 00:58:46,465
Uh, inside the secret pie?

686
00:58:46,466 --> 00:58:49,718
Uh, I don't know. Fish?

687
00:58:49,719 --> 00:58:52,262
No, not fish, silly!

688
00:58:52,263 --> 00:58:55,015
- Want me to tell you?
- Uhh, yes, please.

689
00:58:55,016 --> 00:58:57,476
OK.

690
00:58:57,477 --> 00:58:59,813
Cheddar cheese and Brussels sprouts.

691
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:06,026
- Seriously?
- Yeah, baked into a pie.

692
00:59:06,027 --> 00:59:08,779
Doesn't it sound delicious?

693
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:11,573
You love Brussels sprouts
and you love Cheddar cheese.

694
00:59:11,574 --> 00:59:14,953
I do, yeah.
No, that sounds very original.

695
00:59:17,622 --> 00:59:19,415
Is it a new recipe you found?

696
00:59:19,416 --> 00:59:21,250
No, I made it up.

697
00:59:21,251 --> 00:59:23,127
Secret pie.

698
00:59:23,128 --> 00:59:25,129
I made a small one for Marvin.

699
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:26,880
He really seemed to like it.

700
00:59:41,146 --> 00:59:46,150
Mm-hm, secret pie.

701
00:59:46,151 --> 00:59:48,278
Honey, I'm glad you like it.

702
00:59:51,322 --> 00:59:53,115
Speaking of secret pie,

703
00:59:53,116 --> 00:59:56,494
I wanted to tell you something
about your secret notebook.

704
00:59:58,204 --> 00:59:59,955
- What?
- Did you ever hear

705
00:59:59,956 --> 01:00:03,375
of the old Italian poet
called Pet-ra-rch, is that it?

706
01:00:03,376 --> 01:00:06,545
Mm, Petrarch. He perfected the sonnet.

707
01:00:06,546 --> 01:00:09,548
Um, I read online
that one of his early books of poems

708
01:00:09,549 --> 01:00:11,425
was called <i>The Secret Book.</i>

709
01:00:11,426 --> 01:00:13,343
Just like yours.

710
01:00:13,344 --> 01:00:14,887
I didn't know that.

711
01:00:14,888 --> 01:00:16,221
You read that?

712
01:00:16,222 --> 01:00:18,432
You just happened upon it online?

713
01:00:18,433 --> 01:00:21,101
And also that he wrote all his love poems

714
01:00:21,102 --> 01:00:23,562
to a beautiful girl called,

715
01:00:23,563 --> 01:00:26,148
ta-dah, Laura.

716
01:00:26,149 --> 01:00:27,566
That's true.

717
01:00:27,567 --> 01:00:29,151
So you have many things in common

718
01:00:29,152 --> 01:00:31,988
with other great and famous poets, you see.

719
01:00:34,491 --> 01:00:38,369
Do you like it there?
It's the waterfalls, your favourite place.

720
01:00:41,915 --> 01:00:44,124
I'm not sure.

721
01:00:44,125 --> 01:00:46,251
Yeah, it's nice there.

722
01:00:46,252 --> 01:00:49,046
So remember,
you promised to finally make copies

723
01:00:49,047 --> 01:00:51,215
of your poems this weekend.

724
01:00:51,216 --> 01:00:53,675
I will, as soon as I have some free time.

725
01:00:53,676 --> 01:00:55,594
You promised me. This weekend.

726
01:00:55,595 --> 01:00:57,805
I will, no, I-I promised.

727
01:00:59,724 --> 01:01:01,934
So why don't you recite me something?

728
01:01:01,935 --> 01:01:06,021
Just a few little lines,
maybe from the love poem.

729
01:01:06,022 --> 01:01:10,442
Well I-I can give you
a few lines I didn't write.

730
01:01:10,443 --> 01:01:14,530
Are they by your hero,
Carlo William Carlos?

731
01:01:14,531 --> 01:01:17,449
William Carlos Williams.

732
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:19,536
I know, darling. I was teasing.

733
01:01:22,705 --> 01:01:25,917
No, it's a poem by a... by a girl I met.

734
01:01:27,418 --> 01:01:29,253
A girl you met?

735
01:01:29,254 --> 01:01:30,587
Yeah, no, like a little girl.

736
01:01:30,588 --> 01:01:32,589
Like a t... like a ten-year-old girl.

737
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:34,758
Oh!

738
01:01:34,759 --> 01:01:36,343
She was on the bus?

739
01:01:36,344 --> 01:01:38,262
No, I met her on my way home from work,

740
01:01:38,263 --> 01:01:40,222
near the old factories.

741
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:44,977
She was waiting for her mom
and her sister and...

742
01:01:44,978 --> 01:01:46,937
and I noticed she had a notebook of poems,

743
01:01:46,938 --> 01:01:49,982
and she read one to me.

744
01:01:49,983 --> 01:01:51,651
From her own secret notebook?

745
01:01:53,486 --> 01:01:55,404
Yeah, exactly.

746
01:01:55,405 --> 01:01:57,448
The picture of the falls
made me think of it.

747
01:01:59,742 --> 01:02:01,910
I just remember how it started.

748
01:02:01,911 --> 01:02:04,205
"Water falls from the bright air,

749
01:02:05,748 --> 01:02:07,208
"falls like hair,

750
01:02:09,085 --> 01:02:11,254
"falling across a young girl's shoulders."

751
01:02:13,798 --> 01:02:16,091
Nice.

752
01:02:16,092 --> 01:02:17,969
Almost like one of yours.

753
01:02:20,263 --> 01:02:23,056
Did she have long hair?

754
01:02:23,057 --> 01:02:25,142
Uh, she did, yeah.

755
01:02:25,143 --> 01:02:26,769
Hmm.

756
01:02:30,189 --> 01:02:33,317
Laura, what's all that flour and stuff for?

757
01:02:33,318 --> 01:02:36,111
For my cupcakes, remember?

758
01:02:36,112 --> 01:02:38,280
Saturday is my turn on the baking booth

759
01:02:38,281 --> 01:02:40,157
in the farmer's market.

760
01:02:40,158 --> 01:02:41,992
I remembered this morning that,
oh, my God,

761
01:02:41,993 --> 01:02:43,870
it's the day after tomorrow.

762
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:49,000
I have so many cupcakes to make. Oh, my!

763
01:02:52,545 --> 01:02:55,089
- You don't like your pie?
- No, I do, yeah!

764
01:03:29,248 --> 01:03:32,000
Our own Romeo and Juliet.

765
01:03:32,001 --> 01:03:35,337
Or, maybe, more like
Antony and Cleopatra?

766
01:03:35,338 --> 01:03:37,422
Speaking of Romeo and Juliet,

767
01:03:37,423 --> 01:03:38,966
Abbott and Costello.

768
01:03:40,343 --> 01:03:43,095
Look, Lou Costello has got to be

769
01:03:43,096 --> 01:03:45,097
the most famous person from Paterson.

770
01:03:45,098 --> 01:03:48,225
Yeah, probably, yeah. I mean, he...

771
01:03:48,226 --> 01:03:51,269
he's got that statue
and he's got his own park.

772
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:53,271
Right, I mean,
Alexander Hamilton has a statue,

773
01:03:53,272 --> 01:03:56,817
others got statues but not their own park!

774
01:03:56,818 --> 01:03:59,069
Hell, even Fetty Wap don't have no park.

775
01:04:02,031 --> 01:04:04,075
Yeah, Lou Costello.

776
01:04:07,328 --> 01:04:09,162
I wonder where Bud Abbott was born?

777
01:04:09,163 --> 01:04:11,456
Uhh, that I know.

778
01:04:11,457 --> 01:04:12,624
Jersey, also.

779
01:04:12,625 --> 01:04:15,544
Asbury Park. Uh, 1895, maybe.

780
01:04:15,545 --> 01:04:17,713
- You knew that?
- Oh, hell, yeah, man.

781
01:04:17,714 --> 01:04:19,354
I know a lot of shit about a lot of shit.

782
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:23,135
And Lou Costello.

783
01:04:23,136 --> 01:04:25,178
- "Who's on first?"
- Uh, who's on first,

784
01:04:25,179 --> 01:04:26,847
what's on second,

785
01:04:26,848 --> 01:04:29,392
- I don't know's on third...
- Wait, who's on first?

786
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:33,520
Who's on first?

787
01:04:33,521 --> 01:04:36,398
Who's on first?

788
01:04:36,399 --> 01:04:38,316
I'll tell ya who's on first.

789
01:04:38,317 --> 01:04:40,444
And I'll tell ya what's on second too.

790
01:04:40,445 --> 01:04:42,320
But you ain't gonna wanna know.

791
01:04:42,321 --> 01:04:43,613
I can explain, sweetheart.

792
01:04:43,614 --> 01:04:46,074
No, let me explain.

793
01:04:46,075 --> 01:04:48,827
That is my cookie jar money.

794
01:04:48,828 --> 01:04:51,079
That is money I've been saving up

795
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:55,083
so I could get my hair fixed
to go to your damn niece's wedding.

796
01:04:55,084 --> 01:04:57,753
That is my money. Mine!

797
01:04:57,754 --> 01:04:59,880
I promise, I will replace it.

798
01:04:59,881 --> 01:05:03,800
I-I will replace it after
this weekend's chess tournament.

799
01:05:03,801 --> 01:05:07,387
Chess tournament?

800
01:05:07,388 --> 01:05:11,183
Doc, you gonna need a chess tourniquet

801
01:05:11,184 --> 01:05:13,394
if you don't put that damn money back.

802
01:05:40,546 --> 01:05:42,048
You OK, Doc?

803
01:05:44,467 --> 01:05:47,677
Paterson, you still don't got a cell phone?

804
01:05:47,678 --> 01:05:49,596
Uh, no... no, I don't want one.

805
01:05:49,597 --> 01:05:50,847
It would be a leash.

806
01:05:50,848 --> 01:05:53,016
What about the better half? She got one?

807
01:05:53,017 --> 01:05:56,728
She's got one, yeah.
And a laptop. And an iPad.

808
01:05:56,729 --> 01:05:58,480
She doesn't want you to get one?

809
01:05:58,481 --> 01:06:04,320
No, no, she's OK about it.

810
01:06:06,823 --> 01:06:08,783
She understands me really well.

811
01:06:11,202 --> 01:06:13,162
Lucky guy.

812
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:21,294
You don't listen to me at all!

813
01:06:21,295 --> 01:06:24,548
The friendship can be folded
into something greater.

814
01:06:24,549 --> 01:06:26,592
I don't want to fold it
into something greater!

815
01:06:30,346 --> 01:06:32,514
Hey, Doc, what d...
what does Abbott and Costello

816
01:06:32,515 --> 01:06:34,559
have to do with, uh, Romeo and Juliet?

817
01:06:36,269 --> 01:06:39,479
- Wait, wait, wait, please.
- Everett!

818
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,440
I would rather drop dead.

819
01:07:02,962 --> 01:07:04,963
Is there anything we can do?

820
01:07:04,964 --> 01:07:08,967
Nah, I always say,
don't try to change things,

821
01:07:08,968 --> 01:07:11,637
or you'll make them even worse.

822
01:07:54,221 --> 01:07:56,807
- Good morning!
- Morning.

823
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,274
You're up late, honey.

824
01:08:06,275 --> 01:08:08,985
Your silent, magic watch
didn't wake you up.

825
01:08:08,986 --> 01:08:11,947
Yeah, it was a little late today.

826
01:08:11,948 --> 01:08:15,825
Well, some days,
something inside just doesn't wanna get up.

827
01:08:15,826 --> 01:08:17,244
Ever feel like that?

828
01:08:18,996 --> 01:08:20,331
Today.

829
01:08:21,874 --> 01:08:24,543
Oh, my. I have so much to do.

830
01:08:26,545 --> 01:08:28,296
I know it's silly, but I'm so excited

831
01:08:28,297 --> 01:08:30,674
about the new farmer's market.

832
01:08:30,675 --> 01:08:33,635
Because if my cupcakes are a big
sensation,

833
01:08:33,636 --> 01:08:37,263
then I might be on my way
to a very successful business.

834
01:08:37,264 --> 01:08:40,600
That would be amazing, honey.

835
01:08:40,601 --> 01:08:42,519
And you know what else?

836
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,771
My guitar should arrive today.

837
01:08:44,772 --> 01:08:48,109
My Harlequin guitar, direct from Esteban.

838
01:08:50,027 --> 01:08:53,488
Is Esteban gonna deliver it personally?

839
01:08:53,489 --> 01:08:54,864
Who knows?

840
01:08:58,411 --> 01:09:01,539
Mmm, smells good.

841
01:09:09,714 --> 01:09:11,632
I like your technique.

842
01:09:35,865 --> 01:09:37,950
<i>The Run.</i>

843
01:09:46,542 --> 01:09:50,003
<i>I go through</i>

844
01:09:50,004 --> 01:09:52,923

01:09:57,511 --> 01:10:00,431

847
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:04,559
<i>while on both sides,</i>

848
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:05,895
<i>trillions more</i>

01:10:07,396 --> 01:10:09,690
<i>stay where they are.</i>

850
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:13,443
<i>The windshield wiper blade</i>

851
01:10:13,444 --> 01:10:15,696
<i>starts to squeak.</i>

852
01:10:17,073 --> 01:10:19,033
<i>The rain has stopped.</i>

853
01:10:20,618 --> 01:10:21,786
<i>I stop.</i>

854
01:10:29,001 --> 01:10:30,794
Morning, Donny.

855
01:10:30,795 --> 01:10:31,961
You OK?

856
01:10:31,962 --> 01:10:33,631
No, not really.

857
01:10:35,966 --> 01:10:37,843
You don't even wanna know.

858
01:11:18,926 --> 01:11:21,052
<i>I go through trillions of molecules</i>

859
01:11:21,053 --> 01:11:22,512

01:11:24,348 --> 01:11:25,890

864
01:11:30,729 --> 01:11:33,816
<i>The windshield wiper blade

865
01:11:35,943 --> 01:11:38,278
<i>The rain has stopped.</i>

866
01:11:38,279 --> 01:11:40,488
<i>I stop.</i>

867
01:11:40,489 --> 01:11:42,157
<i>On the corner,</i>

868
01:11:42,158 --> 01:11:44,784
<i>a boy in a yellow raincoat</i>

869
01:11:44,785 --> 01:11:46,871
<i>holding his mother's hand.</i>

870
01:13:51,245 --> 01:13:52,912
I think it's probably best if we, uh,

871
01:13:52,913 --> 01:13:55,999
stand as far away from the bus as we can.

872
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,626
It's not gonna catch on
fire or anything, is it?

873
01:13:58,627 --> 01:14:00,670
It could explode into a fireball!

874
01:14:00,671 --> 01:14:02,964
Oh, no, ma'am.
It's just an electrical problem.

875
01:14:02,965 --> 01:14:04,674
What's gonna happen to us now?

876
01:14:04,675 --> 01:14:06,259
Are we stranded here?

877
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:09,595
Oh, no, no, no.
Another bus will come get us shortly.

878
01:14:09,596 --> 01:14:11,557
Dear God.

879
01:14:18,188 --> 01:14:21,441
I think we'll just gather up over there,
if you don't mind, thank you very much.

880
01:14:21,442 --> 01:14:26,029
OK, people. Let's join
the rest of the passengers, if we could.

881
01:14:26,030 --> 01:14:27,989
- Did we run out of gas?
- No, plenty of gas.

882
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:30,450
It's just, uh, an electrical problem.

883
01:14:30,451 --> 01:14:33,244
Sabotage, probably.

884
01:14:33,245 --> 01:14:36,205
OK, let's... let's come over here.

885
01:14:36,206 --> 01:14:38,041
Another bus will come get us in a minute.

886
01:14:38,042 --> 01:14:42,211
OK everyone, I... I apologise again
for this inconvenience.

887
01:14:42,212 --> 01:14:44,130
I think it's best if we wait
here for a few minutes

888
01:14:44,131 --> 01:14:48,260
and, uh, I'll call now
for a replacement bus.

889
01:14:53,349 --> 01:14:56,225
- Don't you have a smartphone?
- Uh, no I-I don't.

890
01:14:56,226 --> 01:14:57,685
I don't, not with me.

891
01:14:57,686 --> 01:14:59,562
Would you like to use my phone,
Mr Bus Driver?

892
01:14:59,563 --> 01:15:02,106
Oh, if you don't mind. Thank you.

893
01:15:02,107 --> 01:15:03,941
So, what's gonna happen to this bus?

894
01:15:03,942 --> 01:15:07,111
Um, well, a... a big truck is gonna come

895
01:15:07,112 --> 01:15:08,654
and tow it back to the depot.

896
01:15:08,655 --> 01:15:10,698
- Awesome.
- Thank you very much.

897
01:15:10,699 --> 01:15:12,200
- I can't wait to see the truck.
- OK, I'll just be over here.

898
01:15:12,201 --> 01:15:13,534
I apologise again.

899
01:15:28,384 --> 01:15:32,678
Hi, this is Paterson, bus 23,
I have a situation.

900
01:15:32,679 --> 01:15:34,389
<i>Third, second and first.</i>

901
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:37,725
<i>Third, second, first.</i>

902
01:15:37,726 --> 01:15:40,186
<i>Pluck all those strings together.</i>

903
01:15:40,187 --> 01:15:41,480
<i>There you have your first chord.</i>

904
01:17:32,883 --> 01:17:35,259
Surprise!

905
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:38,138
Just sit down, darling,
for a second, and listen to this.

906
01:17:39,431 --> 01:17:40,682
OK.

907
01:17:52,027 --> 01:17:56,364
♪ I've been working on the railroad

908
01:17:56,365 --> 01:18:00,660
♪ All the livelong day

909
01:18:00,661 --> 01:18:04,539
♪ I've been working on the railroad

910
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:08,794
♪ Just to pass the time away ♪

911
01:18:10,587 --> 01:18:14,340
Well, that's as far as I got so far.

912
01:18:14,341 --> 01:18:15,883
But it's pretty amazing, right?

913
01:18:15,884 --> 01:18:17,218
For someone who never played before?

914
01:18:17,219 --> 01:18:18,844
It's very amazing.

915
01:18:18,845 --> 01:18:20,388
You just learned all that today?

916
01:18:20,389 --> 01:18:23,558
Yeah, from these instructional DVDs.

917
01:18:23,559 --> 01:18:26,227
And I've been baking all day too.

918
01:18:26,228 --> 01:18:28,020
Well, I'm very impressed.

919
01:18:28,021 --> 01:18:29,564
Isn't she beautiful?

920
01:18:29,565 --> 01:18:32,400
Yeah, you two were made for each other.

921
01:18:32,401 --> 01:18:35,069
What's it called again? The... the Jester?

922
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:37,405
- No, the Harlequin.
- Harlequin.

923
01:18:37,406 --> 01:18:39,324
And thank you, my love.

924
01:18:42,244 --> 01:18:45,121
You look a little drained.

925
01:18:45,122 --> 01:18:46,539
You're home a little late.

926
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:48,499
Was your day OK?

927
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,085
Well, it was until the bus broke down.

928
01:18:51,086 --> 01:18:53,462
The bus broke down? Was it dangerous?

929
01:18:53,463 --> 01:18:56,757
No, it was just, uh, just sputtered out.

930
01:18:56,758 --> 01:18:58,551
It was an electrical problem.

931
01:18:58,552 --> 01:19:00,553
Electrical problem?

932
01:19:00,554 --> 01:19:03,264
Could it have exploded into a fireball?

933
01:19:03,265 --> 01:19:05,683
No, no.

934
01:19:05,684 --> 01:19:07,977
It's just an old bus.

935
01:19:07,978 --> 01:19:09,895
Well, I think they should
get their best driver,

936
01:19:09,896 --> 01:19:12,106
who's also a great poet, a brand-new bus.

937
01:19:12,107 --> 01:19:13,482
It's the least they could do.

938
01:19:13,483 --> 01:19:15,276
The city of Paterson?

939
01:19:15,277 --> 01:19:16,653
Not likely.

940
01:19:18,238 --> 01:19:20,198
Well, honey. I'm just glad you're OK.

941
01:19:23,368 --> 01:19:25,202
Maybe you should get a smartphone.

942
01:19:25,203 --> 01:19:26,621
Just for emergencies.

943
01:19:26,622 --> 01:19:28,623
You know I don't want one.

944
01:19:28,624 --> 01:19:31,542
The world worked fine
before they even existed.

945
01:19:31,543 --> 01:19:34,796
I know, darling,
but sometimes they make things easier.

946
01:19:37,090 --> 01:19:38,841
Honey, since the kitchen's a mess

947
01:19:38,842 --> 01:19:41,510
with all my baking going on,
couldn't we order out?

948
01:19:41,511 --> 01:19:43,763
Like, a pizza?

949
01:19:43,764 --> 01:19:47,058
- Pizza's fine with me.
- Great.

950
01:19:47,059 --> 01:19:49,477
Then after dinner,
while you and Marvin go out,

951
01:19:49,478 --> 01:19:52,063
I could practise just a little more.

952
01:19:52,064 --> 01:19:54,483
I wanna learn the rest
of that song, at least.

953
01:20:16,213 --> 01:20:17,422
The Harlequin.

954
01:20:33,188 --> 01:20:35,648
So what'd they do?
Send a mechanic, uh, on site

955
01:20:35,649 --> 01:20:37,358
or tow the motherfucker or what?

956
01:20:37,359 --> 01:20:39,610
Yeah, yeah.
They come and tow it back to the depot,

957
01:20:39,611 --> 01:20:42,363
and they send a replacement bus
for the passengers.

958
01:20:42,364 --> 01:20:44,240
Man, that could've been a lot worse.

959
01:20:44,241 --> 01:20:46,784
Damn thing could've exploded
into a fuckin' fireball!

960
01:20:53,875 --> 01:20:56,377
Hey, Doc,
if you're not doing anything tomorrow,

961
01:20:56,378 --> 01:20:58,546
they're having
the new outdoor farmer's market again.

962
01:20:58,547 --> 01:21:01,173
And I know for a fact
there's gonna be

963
01:21:01,174 --> 01:21:05,511
some fantastic cupcakes
for sale in the bakery booth.

964
01:21:05,512 --> 01:21:10,099
Oh, tomorrow's, uh... tomorrow's Saturday.

965
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:13,352
I got that big chess tournament
goin' on over there in Camden.

966
01:21:13,353 --> 01:21:15,563
Oh, right, right.

967
01:21:15,564 --> 01:21:17,732
OK, well, good luck.

968
01:21:17,733 --> 01:21:19,650
Yeah, thanks.

969
01:21:19,651 --> 01:21:21,235
Hey, fellas.

970
01:21:21,236 --> 01:21:23,320
- Hey, Marie.
- Hey, shortie.

971
01:21:23,321 --> 01:21:25,489
How you and, uh, Romeo doin'?

972
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:27,575
Please, Everett!

973
01:21:27,576 --> 01:21:29,201
And we're not doing.

974
01:21:29,202 --> 01:21:31,162
If anything, he's acting worse.

975
01:21:31,163 --> 01:21:33,622
But I think the key word is acting.

976
01:21:33,623 --> 01:21:37,460
Well, how well do you really know him?

977
01:21:37,461 --> 01:21:39,128
We've known each other since we were
kids.

978
01:21:39,129 --> 01:21:40,212
And I really do care about him.

979
01:21:40,213 --> 01:21:41,714
It's just...

980
01:21:41,715 --> 01:21:43,632
this whole girlfriend
thing was a big mistake.

981
01:21:43,633 --> 01:21:46,051
Obviously.

982
01:21:46,052 --> 01:21:48,596
It's cool. He just needs to act out.

983
01:21:48,597 --> 01:21:50,723
He's always been that way.
He needed some kind of drama,

984
01:21:50,724 --> 01:21:52,099
and then he gets over it.

985
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:54,101
He's not gonna do anything crazy, is he?

986
01:21:54,102 --> 01:21:55,895
If you ask me, everything he does is crazy.

987
01:21:58,732 --> 01:22:01,233
Speak of the devil.

988
01:22:01,234 --> 01:22:03,527
Baby, I need to talk to you for a minute.

989
01:22:03,528 --> 01:22:05,404
Everett, why can't you
just forget about me?

990
01:22:05,405 --> 01:22:08,533
- Because I am in love with you.
- Well, you can't have me.

991
01:22:15,165 --> 01:22:16,583
OK.

992
01:22:20,378 --> 01:22:22,255
OK.

993
01:22:27,135 --> 01:22:30,180
OK, then nobody move!

994
01:22:37,729 --> 01:22:40,314
If I can't have you,
then I guess nobody can.

995
01:22:40,315 --> 01:22:41,816
Everett.

996
01:22:41,817 --> 01:22:43,234
Stop acting crazy.

997
01:22:43,235 --> 01:22:45,778
Crazy? You wanna see crazy?

998
01:22:45,779 --> 01:22:47,948
I'll show y'all crazy!

999
01:22:53,912 --> 01:22:55,747
Smooth move, Paterson.

1000
01:23:01,962 --> 01:23:04,004
You damn chucklehead.

1001
01:23:04,005 --> 01:23:06,257
Comin' in here. Clearin' out my place.

1002
01:23:06,258 --> 01:23:09,636
I oughta kick your black ass.

1003
01:23:26,194 --> 01:23:29,363
Without love,

1004
01:23:29,364 --> 01:23:32,242
what reason is there for anything?

1005
01:23:44,296 --> 01:23:47,089
Thanks, Paterson.

1006
01:23:47,090 --> 01:23:49,341
That was very heroic.

1007
01:23:49,342 --> 01:23:50,926
Yeah, wow. OK.

1008
01:23:50,927 --> 01:23:52,344
I don't know.

1009
01:23:52,345 --> 01:23:54,179
If it wasn't for you,

1010
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:56,181
crazy motherfucker
might have shot himself to death

1011
01:23:56,182 --> 01:23:58,017
with a piece of foam.

1012
01:24:30,675 --> 01:24:32,260
Good morning.

1013
01:24:35,221 --> 01:24:36,722
What time is it?

1014
01:24:36,723 --> 01:24:39,184
- It's Saturday morning, baby.
- Oh.

1015
01:24:41,019 --> 01:24:43,604
You were out a little late last night.

1016
01:24:43,605 --> 01:24:46,523
Yeah.

1017
01:24:46,524 --> 01:24:49,444
There was, umm...

1018
01:24:50,904 --> 01:24:54,239
an incident at the... at the bar.

1019
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:58,118
Incident at the bar? What happened?

1020
01:24:58,119 --> 01:25:00,079
Well...

1021
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,956
- Oh, a guy had a gun.
- What?

1022
01:25:01,957 --> 01:25:03,916
Well, he had what I thought was a real gun.

1023
01:25:03,917 --> 01:25:05,459
And he threatened this girl and...

1024
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:07,294
Oh my God! He threatened a girl?

1025
01:25:07,295 --> 01:25:09,088
He threatened to shoot himself.

1026
01:25:09,089 --> 01:25:11,674
All because he's in love with her.

1027
01:25:11,675 --> 01:25:14,677
It's complicated. Anyway, I tried to
stop him and I knocked the gun away

1028
01:25:14,678 --> 01:25:17,137
and turns out it was a toy gun

1029
01:25:17,138 --> 01:25:18,682
that shoots little foam pellets.

1030
01:25:21,017 --> 01:25:23,018
Sure looked real, though.

1031
01:25:23,019 --> 01:25:25,104
Oh, honey.

1032
01:25:25,105 --> 01:25:28,399
Oh, that's so frightening.

1033
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,902
You acted so heroically.

1034
01:25:34,823 --> 01:25:37,366
I told you that place could be dangerous.

1035
01:25:37,367 --> 01:25:40,202
I mean, anyone could
just walk in there any time

1036
01:25:40,203 --> 01:25:42,037
with a shotgun or something.

1037
01:25:42,038 --> 01:25:43,330
Now you see what I mean?

1038
01:25:43,331 --> 01:25:45,207
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1039
01:25:45,208 --> 01:25:47,627
But it was only... it was only a toy gun.

1040
01:25:49,295 --> 01:25:51,130
Why are you up already?

1041
01:25:51,131 --> 01:25:52,965
It's Saturday.

1042
01:25:52,966 --> 01:25:55,884
I have to get my cupcakes
to the farmer's market.

1043
01:25:55,885 --> 01:25:58,013
- Remember?
- I do now.

1044
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:03,727
I smell cupcakes.

1045
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:14,362
Mmm, still smell a hint of beer.

1046
01:26:31,379 --> 01:26:32,838
Wow!

1047
01:26:32,839 --> 01:26:35,132
This looks fantastic, baby.

1048
01:26:35,133 --> 01:26:37,635
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1049
01:26:42,724 --> 01:26:45,142
Who's sitting in Daddy's chair?

1050
01:26:45,143 --> 01:26:46,895
Who's sitting in Daddy's chair, huh?

1051
01:26:50,398 --> 01:26:52,191
William Carlos Williams?

1052
01:26:52,192 --> 01:26:54,903
Oh, no, uh, Carlo William Carlos.

1053
01:26:58,156 --> 01:27:00,532
Will you read me
that one I love so much?

1054
01:27:00,533 --> 01:27:01,950
"This Is Just To Say"?

1055
01:27:01,951 --> 01:27:03,703
Comin' up.

1056
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:12,003
"This is just to say

1057
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:18,050
"I have eaten the plums
that were in the icebox

1058
01:27:18,051 --> 01:27:21,720
"and which you were probably
saving for breakfast.

1059
01:27:21,721 --> 01:27:23,931
"Forgive me.

1060
01:27:23,932 --> 01:27:26,725
"They were delicious,

1061
01:27:26,726 --> 01:27:30,729
"so sweet and so cold."

1062
01:27:30,730 --> 01:27:34,108
- Oh, I love that poem.
- Yeah, that's a good one.

1063
01:27:34,109 --> 01:27:36,276
And some of yours are just as good.

1064
01:27:36,277 --> 01:27:37,445
Well...

1065
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:42,866
Now, remember your promise.

1066
01:27:42,867 --> 01:27:44,493
I promised.

1067
01:27:44,494 --> 01:27:46,036
I better get going.

1068
01:27:46,037 --> 01:27:48,747
Could you put the rest in the boxes?

1069
01:27:48,748 --> 01:27:50,041
Sure.

1070
01:28:11,813 --> 01:28:13,272
OK.

1071
01:28:13,273 --> 01:28:14,815
This is the last of 'em.

1072
01:28:14,816 --> 01:28:16,150
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
- Oh, wow.

1073
01:28:16,151 --> 01:28:18,443
All together like this, they look great.

1074
01:28:18,444 --> 01:28:21,530
- I'm so excited.
- Good.

1075
01:28:21,531 --> 01:28:23,615
OK, they should be good,
if you just drive slowly.

1076
01:28:23,616 --> 01:28:25,201
Yeah, yeah. I... I will.

1077
01:28:31,082 --> 01:28:32,166
You're not taking him with you?

1078
01:28:32,167 --> 01:28:35,127
Oh, honey, I can't.

1079
01:28:35,128 --> 01:28:37,505
Maybe you could
take him for a walk later, huh?

1080
01:28:39,215 --> 01:28:41,133
Love you.

1081
01:28:41,134 --> 01:28:42,135
Yeah, love you.

1082
01:29:02,197 --> 01:29:03,615
All right. Come on, Marvin.

1083
01:29:23,885 --> 01:29:25,970
Come on, Marvin.
Can't we stop here for a second?

1084
01:29:38,441 --> 01:29:40,525
<i>Pumpkin</i>

1085
01:29:40,526 --> 01:29:43,403
<i>My little pumpkin,</i>

1086
01:29:43,404 --> 01:29:48,785
<i>I like to think about
other girls sometimes,</i>

1087
01:29:49,911 --> 01:29:51,787
<i>but</i>

1088
01:29:51,788 --> 01:29:54,206
<i>the truth is</i>

1089
01:29:54,207 --> 01:29:58,169
<i>if you ever left me,</i>

1090
01:30:01,673 --> 01:30:05,843
<i>I'd tear my heart out</i>

1091
01:30:08,888 --> 01:30:11,933
<i>and never put it back.</i>

1092
01:30:14,227 --> 01:30:18,564
<i>There'll never be anyone like you.</i>

1093
01:30:20,233 --> 01:30:23,193
<i>How embarrassing.</i>

1094
01:30:31,911 --> 01:30:34,122
- Honey?
- Down here.

1095
01:30:39,252 --> 01:30:42,297
- How'd it go?
- Oh, honey, I'm so happy!

1096
01:30:44,132 --> 01:30:48,468
You won't believe this, but I made $286.

1097
01:30:48,469 --> 01:30:49,928
Wow.

1098
01:30:49,929 --> 01:30:51,596
My cupcakes were a huge hit.

1099
01:30:51,597 --> 01:30:53,015
Everyone's talking about them.

1100
01:30:53,016 --> 01:30:54,725
That's fantastic.

1101
01:30:55,977 --> 01:30:57,645
Marvin!

1102
01:31:14,996 --> 01:31:18,081
$286 cash money, baby.

1103
01:31:18,082 --> 01:31:19,875
Wow!

1104
01:31:19,876 --> 01:31:22,544
I know it's no big deal.
It's just silly cupcakes.

1105
01:31:22,545 --> 01:31:24,254
But I'm quite proud of myself.

1106
01:31:24,255 --> 01:31:26,131
Oh, yeah, you should be.

1107
01:31:26,132 --> 01:31:27,716
Can we celebrate?

1108
01:31:27,717 --> 01:31:30,135
Uh, yeah, sure. What should we do?

1109
01:31:30,136 --> 01:31:32,888
- First of all, I'm gonna treat.
- OK.

1110
01:31:32,889 --> 01:31:35,557
I'd like to go to dinner
and then go to the movies.

1111
01:31:35,558 --> 01:31:39,102
We haven't gone to the movies in so long.

1112
01:31:39,103 --> 01:31:41,730
Uh, yeah, no... no we haven't.
What should we see?

1113
01:31:41,731 --> 01:31:43,440
You know that one theatre at the mall

1114
01:31:43,441 --> 01:31:46,360
now shows old scary movies
on Saturday nights?

1115
01:31:46,361 --> 01:31:48,028
We could see an old scary movie.

1116
01:31:48,029 --> 01:31:49,863
I'm gonna get changed and get ready.

1117
01:31:49,864 --> 01:31:50,990
I'm very proud of you.

1118
01:31:53,451 --> 01:31:55,869
And you, my little man.

1119
01:31:55,870 --> 01:31:59,290
You're gonna have to stay here
and guard the palace.

1120
01:32:05,797 --> 01:32:07,077
Honey, should I change my shirt?

1121
01:32:09,258 --> 01:32:11,094
That'd be nice.

1122
01:32:19,769 --> 01:32:22,521
This is so much fun.

1123
01:32:22,522 --> 01:32:25,483
It's like, you're living
in the 20th century.

1124
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:35,242
This is Mr Parker, Lota.

1125
01:32:35,243 --> 01:32:38,203
How do you do? Don't be afraid.

1126
01:32:38,204 --> 01:32:40,080
How do you do?

1127
01:32:40,081 --> 01:32:43,083
Mr Parker has come to us
from over the sea.

1128
01:32:43,084 --> 01:32:45,460
She's a pure Polynesian.

1129
01:32:45,461 --> 01:32:48,547
The only woman on the entire island.

1130
01:32:48,548 --> 01:32:51,508
Well, uh, I'll leave
you two young people together.

1131
01:32:51,509 --> 01:32:53,386
I've got work to do.

1132
01:32:57,640 --> 01:32:59,016
Won't you sit down?

1133
01:33:00,893 --> 01:33:03,228
You come from the sea?

1134
01:33:03,229 --> 01:33:06,983
Well, around it.
Three days on an upturned lifeboat.

1135
01:33:08,985 --> 01:33:12,238
- You go away?
- Tomorrow morning.

1136
01:33:14,574 --> 01:33:16,909
I wish you would not go away.

1137
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:23,624
Oh, that's very nice of you, but I must.

1138
01:33:25,668 --> 01:33:28,295
You'll come back? Again?

1139
01:33:28,296 --> 01:33:30,798
Well I-I don't know.

1140
01:33:33,384 --> 01:33:36,344
How does it happen
that you're the only woman on this island?

1141
01:33:36,345 --> 01:33:38,973
Did, uh, Dr Moreau bring you here?

1142
01:33:40,850 --> 01:33:44,145
Pardon me if I seem to be too inquisitive.

1143
01:33:46,355 --> 01:33:48,190
Quickly, please!

1144
01:33:49,650 --> 01:33:51,360
Get out!

1145
01:33:57,158 --> 01:33:59,618
They're vivisecting a human being.

1146
01:33:59,619 --> 01:34:02,996
They're cutting a living man to pieces.

1147
01:34:02,997 --> 01:34:04,624
Now I know about his natives.

1148
01:34:06,292 --> 01:34:08,710
They're his victims.

1149
01:34:08,711 --> 01:34:11,505
I did love it that it
was in black and white.

1150
01:34:11,506 --> 01:34:14,090
Yeah, yeah, I haven't...

1151
01:34:14,091 --> 01:34:16,219
I haven't seen a black-and-white movie
in a long time.

1152
01:34:18,304 --> 01:34:20,680
My favourite part was when the lead guy

1153
01:34:20,681 --> 01:34:22,599
kissed the wild panther girl.

1154
01:34:24,101 --> 01:34:26,603
You look... you look like her.

1155
01:34:26,604 --> 01:34:28,105
You do. You guys could be twins.

1156
01:34:34,403 --> 01:34:36,613
Well, thank you for treating me
to dinner and a movie.

1157
01:34:36,614 --> 01:34:40,033
I'm happy I could.

1158
01:34:40,034 --> 01:34:42,953
- We should do it every weekend.
- Yeah.

1159
01:34:42,954 --> 01:34:46,456
Now that you're
the cupcake queen of Paterson.

1160
01:34:46,457 --> 01:34:48,709
Cupcake queen of Paterson.

1161
01:34:49,460 --> 01:34:51,086
I love it.

1162
01:34:51,087 --> 01:34:52,171
Thank you.

1163
01:35:04,308 --> 01:35:06,060
What is this?

1164
01:35:07,353 --> 01:35:08,854
Marvin?

1165
01:35:11,649 --> 01:35:14,986
Marvin, did you do this?

1166
01:35:26,372 --> 01:35:28,248
Oh, my God!

1167
01:35:28,249 --> 01:35:30,208
It's...

1168
01:35:30,209 --> 01:35:31,586
It's your notebook.

1169
01:35:34,589 --> 01:35:35,923
It's what?

1170
01:35:37,341 --> 01:35:39,218
Your poems.

1171
01:35:42,888 --> 01:35:44,724
Honey, I'm so sorry.

1172
01:35:51,439 --> 01:35:54,399
I don't know what to even say.

1173
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:59,238
You... you usually keep your notebook
down at the basement.

1174
01:36:01,949 --> 01:36:06,370
I guess I left it up here on the sofa.

1175
01:36:09,832 --> 01:36:11,709
That stupid dog.

1176
01:36:13,711 --> 01:36:15,880
He's gotta be put out in the garage.

1177
01:37:18,567 --> 01:37:21,277
Honey, it's so early.

1178
01:37:21,278 --> 01:37:22,863
It's Sunday.

1179
01:37:24,615 --> 01:37:26,409
Please, come back to sleep.

1180
01:37:29,745 --> 01:37:31,538
Please, baby.

1181
01:37:31,539 --> 01:37:33,665
I will, I will, baby.

1182
01:37:33,666 --> 01:37:35,626
Ye... Go back to sleep.

1183
01:38:59,668 --> 01:39:01,837
I don't like you, Marvin.

1184
01:39:13,349 --> 01:39:15,183
Marvin, didn't I put you in the garage?

1185
01:39:15,184 --> 01:39:18,436
No, it's OK,
I let him back in when I went outside.

1186
01:39:18,437 --> 01:39:20,939
No, he's going back out there!

1187
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:22,483
Come on, Marvin!

1188
01:39:24,193 --> 01:39:26,820
No! You're staying out there!

1189
01:39:42,127 --> 01:39:45,297
I wish you would have read me
some of your most recent poems.

1190
01:39:46,882 --> 01:39:49,467
Maybe I could've remembered them.

1191
01:39:49,468 --> 01:39:50,594
It's OK.

1192
01:39:52,429 --> 01:39:53,764
They were just words...

1193
01:39:56,559 --> 01:39:57,852
written on water.

1194
01:39:59,562 --> 01:40:01,564
Baby, I'm so sorry.

1195
01:40:04,525 --> 01:40:07,360
I saved all the pieces.

1196
01:40:07,361 --> 01:40:11,239
Maybe, somehow,
they could be puzzled back together,

1197
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:13,783
with a computer programme, or something.

1198
01:40:20,624 --> 01:40:22,710
Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?

1199
01:40:25,170 --> 01:40:28,214
Should I play you the song
I've been learning on my guitar?

1200
01:40:28,215 --> 01:40:30,925
Oh, no, that's OK.

1201
01:40:30,926 --> 01:40:35,054
Th... I appreciate the offer,
just, maybe, not right now.

1202
01:40:35,055 --> 01:40:36,056
OK?

1203
01:40:40,311 --> 01:40:43,021
Maybe you just wanna be left alone?

1204
01:40:43,022 --> 01:40:44,606
Should I go out for a while?

1205
01:40:44,607 --> 01:40:46,984
Oh, n-n-no, no. No, it's OK.

1206
01:40:55,576 --> 01:40:58,411
Maybe I'll go out.

1207
01:40:58,412 --> 01:40:59,788
Take a little walk.

1208
01:41:55,094 --> 01:41:57,637
Paterson. It's you.

1209
01:41:57,638 --> 01:41:59,556
Hello, Everett.

1210
01:42:02,643 --> 01:42:06,479
I'm sorry about the other night.

1211
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:08,357
I kinda lost myself.

1212
01:42:09,733 --> 01:42:11,110
Yeah.

1213
01:42:13,404 --> 01:42:15,364
It's OK. Are you doing better now?

1214
01:42:18,575 --> 01:42:20,869
Yeah, I guess so.

1215
01:42:27,668 --> 01:42:30,003
You OK?

1216
01:42:30,004 --> 01:42:32,005
You look a little low yourself.

1217
01:42:32,006 --> 01:42:33,632
Yeah, yeah.

1218
01:42:37,011 --> 01:42:38,928
I'm OK.

1219
01:42:38,929 --> 01:42:41,347
Well, it's like they always say.

1220
01:42:41,348 --> 01:42:45,226
"The sun still rises every mornin'
and sets every evenin'."

1221
01:42:45,227 --> 01:42:48,063
- Always another day, right?
- Yeah.

1222
01:42:51,233 --> 01:42:53,317
So far.

1223
01:42:53,318 --> 01:42:54,903
So far, yeah.

1224
01:42:58,866 --> 01:43:03,661
So, I guess I'll see you around, then.

1225
01:43:03,662 --> 01:43:05,664
- Yeah, yeah, take care.
- Yeah, you too.

1226
01:44:10,854 --> 01:44:12,480
Excuse me, please.

1227
01:44:12,481 --> 01:44:14,941
Allow to sit?

1228
01:44:14,942 --> 01:44:16,526
Uh, yeah.

1229
01:44:16,527 --> 01:44:18,070
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

1230
01:45:01,822 --> 01:45:03,531
Excuse me.

1231
01:45:03,532 --> 01:45:06,117
Maybe not acceptable behaviour,

1232
01:45:06,118 --> 01:45:10,873
but may I ask if you from here,
in Paterson, New Jersey?

1233
01:45:11,915 --> 01:45:13,374
Am I?

1234
01:45:13,375 --> 01:45:16,127
Uh, yeah.

1235
01:45:16,128 --> 01:45:17,671
Yes I am. I was born here.

1236
01:45:18,922 --> 01:45:20,631
Excuse me again.

1237
01:45:20,632 --> 01:45:25,052
But, are you knowing the great
poet, William Carlos Williams?

1238
01:45:25,053 --> 01:45:26,930
Here in Paterson, New Jersey?

1239
01:45:29,933 --> 01:45:33,394
Well, I'm aware of his poems.

1240
01:45:33,395 --> 01:45:35,314
Excellent.

1241
01:45:40,944 --> 01:45:46,283
May I ask if you too are a poet
of Paterson, New Jersey?

1242
01:45:48,368 --> 01:45:51,747
Uh, no.

1243
01:45:52,372 --> 01:45:53,873
No.

1244
01:45:53,874 --> 01:45:55,167
I see.

1245
01:46:01,632 --> 01:46:03,175
I'm a bus driver, myself.

1246
01:46:04,635 --> 01:46:06,636
Just a bus driver.

1247
01:46:06,637 --> 01:46:08,597
A bus driver in Paterson.

1248
01:46:09,556 --> 01:46:11,141
Ah.

1249
01:46:13,852 --> 01:46:15,811
This very poetic.

1250
01:46:15,812 --> 01:46:17,396
Well, I'm not so sure 'bout that.

1251
01:46:17,397 --> 01:46:21,859
Yes. This could be poem
by William Carlos Williams.

1252
01:46:25,822 --> 01:46:30,243
Did you know interesting
French artist Jean Dubuffet

1253
01:46:30,244 --> 01:46:36,624
was meteorologist on top
of Eiffel Tower, Paris, in 1922?

1254
01:46:36,625 --> 01:46:39,252
- Very poetic.
- Yeah.

1255
01:46:39,253 --> 01:46:42,171
Yeah, Jean Dubuffet.

1256
01:46:42,172 --> 01:46:44,591
Yeah, he was, uh, he was a meteorologist.

1257
01:46:46,426 --> 01:46:51,013
This I learn from poem
by your interesting poet,

1258
01:46:51,014 --> 01:46:53,266
Frank O'Hara of New York City.

1259
01:46:53,267 --> 01:46:56,269
Yeah, I read that, too.

1260
01:46:56,270 --> 01:46:57,521
I like Frank O'Hara.

1261
01:46:58,772 --> 01:47:03,609
The... the New York School.

1262
01:47:03,610 --> 01:47:04,820
Ah ha.

1263
01:47:14,413 --> 01:47:16,331
I guess you really like poetry, then?

1264
01:47:17,624 --> 01:47:19,042
I breathe poetry.

1265
01:47:23,755 --> 01:47:25,549
So, you write poetry?

1266
01:47:26,258 --> 01:47:27,384
Yes.

1267
01:47:31,263 --> 01:47:33,347
My notebooks.

1268
01:47:33,348 --> 01:47:34,558
Ah, yeah.

1269
01:47:36,643 --> 01:47:38,395
My poetry only in Japanese.

1270
01:47:39,271 --> 01:47:40,772
No translation.

1271
01:47:42,733 --> 01:47:45,234
Poetry in translation is like

1272
01:47:45,235 --> 01:47:47,987
taking a shower with a raincoat on.

1273
01:47:51,074 --> 01:47:52,576
I see what you mean.

1274
01:47:56,496 --> 01:47:59,081
I hope this isn't, um,
inappropriate behaviour,

1275
01:47:59,082 --> 01:48:02,668
but may I ask what you're doing
here in Paterson?

1276
01:48:02,669 --> 01:48:06,005
I come here to see city
of your interesting poet,

1277
01:48:06,006 --> 01:48:07,798
William Carlos Williams,

1278
01:48:07,799 --> 01:48:11,719
who lived and make his poems
here in Paterson, New Jersey.

1279
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:14,055
- As you know.
- Yeah, yeah. He lived here.

1280
01:48:14,056 --> 01:48:15,639
He was a doctor.

1281
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:17,475
Ah ha.

1282
01:48:19,061 --> 01:48:20,312
"Ah ha," what?

1283
01:48:21,855 --> 01:48:26,026
Also Allen Ginsberg is growing up here.

1284
01:48:27,277 --> 01:48:28,904
Also Paterson, New Jersey.

1285
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:31,782
Yeah, that's true.

1286
01:48:50,008 --> 01:48:51,717
I leave here tomorrow.

1287
01:48:51,718 --> 01:48:53,302
Nice to meet you.

1288
01:48:53,303 --> 01:48:58,140
Oh, nice to meet you. Are you...
you're going back to Tokyo?

1289
01:48:58,141 --> 01:48:59,433
No, Osaka.

1290
01:48:59,434 --> 01:49:02,728
Oh, Osaka. What I meant.
Have a good trip.

1291
01:49:02,729 --> 01:49:03,730
Thank you.

1292
01:49:05,190 --> 01:49:07,025
- I'm sorry.
- Oh.

1293
01:49:20,330 --> 01:49:21,831
A gift.

1294
01:49:21,832 --> 01:49:23,457
A gift?

1295
01:49:23,458 --> 01:49:25,751
Yes.

1296
01:49:25,752 --> 01:49:29,756
Sometime empty page
present most possibilities.

1297
01:49:37,180 --> 01:49:39,057
Thank you. That's very kind of you.

1298
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:52,070
Excuse me!

1299
01:49:53,238 --> 01:49:55,115
Ah ha!

1300
01:50:06,877 --> 01:50:08,837
Ah ha.

1301
01:50:50,962 --> 01:50:52,881
<i>The Line</i>

1302
01:50:54,549 --> 01:50:57,010
<i>There's an old song</i>

1303
01:50:58,345 --> 01:51:03,182
<i>my grandfather used to sing</i>

1304
01:51:03,183 --> 01:51:05,352
<i>that has the question,</i>

1305
01:51:07,062 --> 01:51:11,941
<i>"Or would you rather be a fish?"</i>

1306
01:51:11,942 --> 01:51:15,277
<i>In the same song</i>

1307
01:51:15,278 --> 01:51:17,863
<i>is the same question</i>

1308
01:51:17,864 --> 01:51:21,993
<i>but with a mule and a pig,</i>

1309
01:51:24,204 --> 01:51:28,666
<i>but the one I hear sometimes</i>

1310
01:51:28,667 --> 01:51:31,168
<i>in my head</i>

1311
01:51:31,169 --> 01:51:34,964
<i>is the fish one.</i>

1312
01:51:34,965 --> 01:51:38,468
<i>Just that one line.</i>

1313
01:51:40,762 --> 01:51:43,640
<i>Would you rather be a fish?</i>

1314
01:51:45,267 --> 01:51:50,355
<i>As if the rest of the song</i>

1315
01:51:51,606 --> 01:51:54,526
<i>didn't have to be there.</i>

1315
01:51:55,305 --> 01:52:55,238

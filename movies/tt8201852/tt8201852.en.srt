3
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,632
Damn it.

4
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,469
Hello?

5
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,479
Is someone there?

6
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:39,720
Goddamn it.

7
00:02:55,736 --> 00:02:57,671
You can't talk right now.

8
00:02:59,006 --> 00:03:01,508
You can't even breathe.

9
00:03:02,876 --> 00:03:05,012
You shouldn't curse, young lady.

10
00:03:05,045 --> 00:03:08,715
Don't curse
unless you want to be cursed.

11
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:11,885
It's a sin, you know.

12
00:03:11,918 --> 00:03:13,687
Cursing.

13
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:17,624
Do you know about sin, Ella?

14
00:03:19,092 --> 00:03:20,627
Go ahead and breathe.

15
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:25,065
How do you know my name?

16
00:03:25,098 --> 00:03:28,068
I know loads of things.

17
00:03:29,803 --> 00:03:32,105
Hey.

18
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:34,841
Want to hear something
really interesting?

19
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:53,126
It's about your fucking daddy!

20
00:04:43,143 --> 00:04:45,145
Goddamn nightmares.

21
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:55,155
<i>Violent or upsetting dreams</i>

22
00:04:55,188 --> 00:04:58,725
<i>are merely the mind's attempt
to release the pressures</i>

23
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:01,161
<i>of our daily thoughts
and fears.</i>

24
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:03,830
As you learn to meditate,

25
00:05:03,864 --> 00:05:07,200
you will discover your mind
is very difficult to silence.

26
00:05:07,235 --> 00:05:10,003
If you try to stop your thoughts

27
00:05:10,036 --> 00:05:12,739
or prevent them
from entering your mind,

28
00:05:12,772 --> 00:05:15,842
you will only create conflict
when you are

29
00:05:15,876 --> 00:05:18,745
trying to achieve pea...

30
00:05:20,847 --> 00:05:22,816
Somebody wants you.

31
00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:25,018
Who?

32
00:05:25,051 --> 00:05:27,020
I have absolutely no idea.

33
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:28,788
I'm so awake.

34
00:05:28,822 --> 00:05:30,790
You need to get in the pool.

35
00:05:31,992 --> 00:05:33,227
Excuse me.

36
00:05:36,796 --> 00:05:38,165
Josh is an idiot.

37
00:05:38,198 --> 00:05:39,833
No argument there.

38
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:41,269
Will you pick up Ella today?

39
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:43,170
I will pick up Ella
anytime, anywhere.

40
00:05:43,203 --> 00:05:44,804
Thank you.

41
00:05:44,838 --> 00:05:46,474
And tomorrow. I'm working.

42
00:05:46,507 --> 00:05:48,975
I thought I was
coming to see you.

43
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:50,244
Really?

44
00:05:50,278 --> 00:05:52,812
Okay. Great.

45
00:05:52,846 --> 00:05:54,282
I'll ask Lena.

46
00:05:54,315 --> 00:05:56,049
Okay.

47
00:06:00,954 --> 00:06:02,689
Old man.

48
00:06:03,957 --> 00:06:05,792
Sunblock.

49
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:13,234
Bye.

50
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,909
Oh, my God, that's...

51
00:06:22,943 --> 00:06:24,978
That's so...

52
00:06:33,954 --> 00:06:36,257
This is a situation

53
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,191
that cannot last.

54
00:06:38,226 --> 00:06:39,960
One! Two!

55
00:06:39,993 --> 00:06:43,331
Three. Four. Five.

56
00:06:43,364 --> 00:06:46,234
Six. Seven.

57
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:48,935
Eight, nine, ten!
Ready or not, here we come.

58
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,777
Where could she possibly be?

59
00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:05,085
There you are!

60
00:07:05,118 --> 00:07:06,987
All right, all right.
That was good.

61
00:07:14,328 --> 00:07:16,997
And you're...

62
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,132
her dad?

63
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:20,568
Husband.

64
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:22,270
Well, there's nothing
on the call sheet,

65
00:07:22,303 --> 00:07:23,870
and it's a closed set.

66
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,105
I'm her husband.

67
00:07:25,138 --> 00:07:26,574
It's a closed set.

68
00:07:26,607 --> 00:07:28,174
I'm her husband.

69
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,377
Rolling!

70
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,279
- Rolling!
- Rolling!

71
00:07:31,312 --> 00:07:33,813
I'm three feet away from you.

72
00:07:35,882 --> 00:07:37,385
Yeah. Rolling.

73
00:07:44,024 --> 00:07:45,892
Yeah, okay.

74
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:47,927
Oh, God.

75
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:53,033
Oh, my God.

76
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:55,336
Oh, my God.

77
00:07:55,369 --> 00:07:57,371
- Cut!
- And that's a cut!

78
00:07:57,405 --> 00:08:00,374
- I have her latte.
- Oh, yeah, come on in, man.

79
00:08:00,408 --> 00:08:01,875
- Um, he's...
- How you doing, man?

80
00:08:01,908 --> 00:08:02,876
- You good?
- Yeah, living the dream.

81
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:04,144
Uh, maybe you could just
ask somebody if she's...

82
00:08:04,177 --> 00:08:06,112
- Going again.
- Going again! Right away!

83
00:08:06,146 --> 00:08:07,348
Rolling!

84
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,152
Okay.

85
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:27,301
- And cut!
- Cut!

86
00:08:27,335 --> 00:08:28,469
Turning around on her!

87
00:08:28,502 --> 00:08:30,036
What the fuck does that mean?

88
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,439
All right, I'm sorry, man, okay?

89
00:08:31,472 --> 00:08:34,275
Look, I'll put a call through
on the radio. Yeah?

90
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:36,009
What was your name again?

91
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:39,012
Theo Conroy.

92
00:08:39,045 --> 00:08:42,283
Yeah, I got a Theo... Conroy.

93
00:08:44,385 --> 00:08:47,421
Yeah, Theo Conroy here
to see Susie.

94
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,025
- I totally got you.
- You did. You got me.

95
00:08:52,058 --> 00:08:53,227
It was excellent, man.
It was really good.

96
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,428
- Thanks.
- Hey, so 6:00 a.m. tomorrow.

97
00:08:54,462 --> 00:08:56,664
- Yep.
- And, uh, I sent you the script for my short, so...

98
00:08:56,697 --> 00:08:58,098
Oh, that's nice.
Thank you.

99
00:08:58,131 --> 00:08:59,966
- All right, I'll see you later.
- Later.

100
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:01,268
There you are.

101
00:09:01,302 --> 00:09:02,336
- Hi.
- Hi.

102
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,505
Mm. I'm sorry about that scene.

103
00:09:04,538 --> 00:09:06,973
It was too much, right?

104
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:09,477
I mean, it felt almost porny.

105
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,312
Josh is such a perv.

106
00:09:11,345 --> 00:09:14,248
He gave me this whole thing
about how the female orgasm

107
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:16,317
is never represented
in American film.

108
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,486
I just think he wanted
to see me naked.

109
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,920
I think he shot it
beautifully, though.

110
00:09:20,954 --> 00:09:23,123
Uh-huh.

111
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:34,934
What?

112
00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:39,373
So the guy, you know,
that stopped me,

113
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:41,141
the one with
the walkie-talkie thing...

114
00:09:41,174 --> 00:09:43,244
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I definitely...

115
00:09:43,277 --> 00:09:44,712
I told him you were coming.

116
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:46,280
No, it's not that.

117
00:09:46,313 --> 00:09:48,214
He recognized me.

118
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,952
I'm sorry. That sucks.

119
00:09:52,986 --> 00:09:55,389
Ah, I should be
used to it by now.

120
00:09:56,457 --> 00:09:58,925
They think you're dangerous.

121
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:04,365
You're not supposed to like it.

122
00:10:06,032 --> 00:10:08,335
I'm not supposed to do
a lot of things.

123
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:14,974
You want to have me in the car?

124
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:27,153
Ooh.

125
00:10:27,187 --> 00:10:30,324
Oh, God, it felt so good
not to fake it.

126
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:37,565
I hated being there today.

127
00:10:37,598 --> 00:10:39,333
I forgot it was today.

128
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:42,135
Hearing that
was like a knife in my brain.

129
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:43,571
I'm so sorry.

130
00:10:45,171 --> 00:10:47,575
If I don't get you
out of here for a while,

131
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:49,477
I think I'm going to go nuts.

132
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,010
Let's just go.

133
00:10:51,044 --> 00:10:52,212
- Where?
- Anywhere.

134
00:10:52,246 --> 00:10:53,481
Away from here.

135
00:10:53,514 --> 00:10:55,081
Well, I've got a few weeks

136
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:56,484
before I start shooting
in London.

137
00:10:56,517 --> 00:10:58,319
Okay. Over there,
we'll go early.

138
00:10:58,352 --> 00:11:01,087
We'll get a place in the country
just you and me and Ella.

139
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,122
It's so good when it's just
the three of us.

140
00:11:03,156 --> 00:11:04,391
Yeah, okay.

141
00:11:04,425 --> 00:11:06,125
Yeah.

142
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:10,231
I think you're done.

143
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:12,500
Sorry.

144
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:14,535
- I'm greedy.
- Mm.

145
00:11:16,403 --> 00:11:18,305
I'm not gonna do these kinds
of parts anymore.

146
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:19,607
That's not realistic.

147
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,609
You're rich and retired.
I'll live off of you.

148
00:11:21,642 --> 00:11:24,512
You don't mean that.

149
00:11:24,545 --> 00:11:27,348
I pretend. It's my job.

150
00:11:27,381 --> 00:11:29,182
I'm working on
the jealous thing.

151
00:11:29,215 --> 00:11:30,518
I really am.

152
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:32,386
I'm writing in the journal.
I meditate.

153
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:33,621
I do the app.

154
00:11:33,654 --> 00:11:35,623
I love you so much.

155
00:11:35,656 --> 00:11:38,526
Then come away with me.

156
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,609
- You're left.
- No, I'm not.

157
00:12:30,344 --> 00:12:33,414
Uh... honey,
I think you're left.

158
00:12:33,447 --> 00:12:35,282
If I had been
any further right,

159
00:12:35,316 --> 00:12:36,517
I would have hit that guy.

160
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,718
You're doing great.

161
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:39,185
Do you want to drive?

162
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:40,321
No, no, no, I mean it.

163
00:12:40,354 --> 00:12:41,322
Yeah, so do I.

164
00:12:41,355 --> 00:12:43,691
- Please, drive.
- I'm too old to flip my brain.

165
00:12:43,724 --> 00:12:46,460
You got this.

166
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:50,297
Daddy, because you're old,
you'll die before Mommy, right?

167
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:51,699
Hey. Hey, hey.

168
00:12:51,732 --> 00:12:53,601
I'm not that old.

169
00:12:53,634 --> 00:12:55,603
But you will die first, right?

170
00:12:55,636 --> 00:12:57,638
Not if I can help it.

171
00:13:01,942 --> 00:13:03,644
Uh, the thing is, sweetie,

172
00:13:03,677 --> 00:13:06,212
nobody really knows
when anybody's gonna die.

173
00:13:06,246 --> 00:13:08,214
Doesn't matter how old you are.

174
00:13:08,248 --> 00:13:10,149
Why do we have to die at all?

175
00:13:10,183 --> 00:13:13,654
Because life is not survivable.

176
00:13:15,322 --> 00:13:18,191
Really? That-that's what
you came up with?

177
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:23,697
Sorry.

178
00:13:24,732 --> 00:13:26,634
Shit.

179
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:34,375
I love your dark side,
but she's six years old.

180
00:13:34,408 --> 00:13:35,309
I got it.

181
00:13:35,342 --> 00:13:37,277
Can you tell her about Heaven
next time?

182
00:13:37,311 --> 00:13:39,279
You can't sell
what you don't believe.

183
00:13:39,313 --> 00:13:41,281
I do it all the time.

184
00:14:02,736 --> 00:14:04,471
Honey, that's a sheepgate.

185
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:08,976
Pretty cool!

186
00:14:23,357 --> 00:14:24,692
That's funny.

187
00:14:26,493 --> 00:14:28,796
I hate you.

188
00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:35,703
Is that our new house?

189
00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:39,339
Wow!

190
00:14:43,877 --> 00:14:47,715
It's so beautiful!

191
00:14:47,748 --> 00:14:49,450
I love it!

192
00:14:49,483 --> 00:14:51,318
Wow.

193
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:55,756
For once, reality is actually
better than the pictures online.

194
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:57,558
It doesn't suck.

195
00:14:58,692 --> 00:15:00,027
Wow.

196
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,695
Seems bigger on the inside.

197
00:15:01,729 --> 00:15:03,530
Oh, my God.

198
00:15:03,564 --> 00:15:05,733
Way bigger.

199
00:15:05,766 --> 00:15:08,368
I love this.

200
00:15:10,637 --> 00:15:12,606
No service, though.

201
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,575
Oh, well.

202
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:17,377
Oh, God.

203
00:15:17,411 --> 00:15:18,879
Wait.

204
00:15:18,912 --> 00:15:21,515
- What?
- Listen.

205
00:15:21,548 --> 00:15:22,850
The quiet.

206
00:15:22,883 --> 00:15:25,385
♪ La-la-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la ♪

207
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:27,554
- ♪ La-la! ♪
- Well, not anymore.

208
00:15:27,588 --> 00:15:29,890
- Got anything down there?
- One bar.

209
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:32,493
Uh, nope. Not anymore.

210
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:36,497
Oh, cool.

211
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:39,433
Weird design.

212
00:15:39,466 --> 00:15:41,368
Oh, maybe upstairs it's better.

213
00:15:41,401 --> 00:15:42,736
Sorry to obsess.

214
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,872
They're calling me
about the schedule for London.

215
00:15:44,905 --> 00:15:46,807
Not a problem.

216
00:15:51,512 --> 00:15:53,881
Whoa.

217
00:15:56,116 --> 00:15:59,386
Boy, they really got rid
of everything personal.

218
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:00,888
They even took down
the pictures.

219
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:03,791
Other people's families
are depressing.

220
00:16:03,824 --> 00:16:05,425
And creepy.

221
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:06,827
And a jump.

222
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,763
I'm jumping, jumping,
jumping, jumping, jumping,

223
00:16:09,797 --> 00:16:12,466
jumping, jumping, jumping,
jumping, jumping,

224
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:14,334
jumping, jumping,
jumping, jumping...

225
00:16:14,368 --> 00:16:15,469
Hey.

226
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,438
Get over here!

227
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:23,377
I didn't give you
a very good answer

228
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,812
to your question before, did I?

229
00:16:24,845 --> 00:16:26,914
No, Baba.
It was very disappointing.

230
00:16:26,947 --> 00:16:28,749
Okay, here's the thing.

231
00:16:28,782 --> 00:16:32,920
I don't plan on dying
for a really long time,

232
00:16:32,953 --> 00:16:36,623
but when I finally do
and when Mommy does

233
00:16:36,657 --> 00:16:39,760
and when you do, too,

234
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:42,462
we're all gonna be
together again.

235
00:16:43,664 --> 00:16:45,465
In Heaven.

236
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:47,568
Are you sure?

237
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:49,736
That's what they say.

238
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,873
Does everyone go to Heaven?

239
00:16:52,906 --> 00:16:54,842
- Uh...
- Oh, my God, Ella,

240
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,476
you have to come up here.

241
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,478
Your bed is the size
of Connecticut.

242
00:16:58,512 --> 00:17:00,447
What?!

243
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,683
Mom, let me see, let me see.

244
00:17:02,716 --> 00:17:04,151
I want to jump on it!

245
00:17:05,652 --> 00:17:07,454
Oh, my God, I love it!

246
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:08,822
It's amazing!

247
00:17:33,714 --> 00:17:35,849
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet,
tweet, tweet, tweet.

248
00:17:35,883 --> 00:17:39,019
♪ Tweet, tweet, tweet,
tweet, tweet, tweet. ♪

249
00:17:39,052 --> 00:17:40,854
Mm...

250
00:17:49,663 --> 00:17:51,899
Huh?

251
00:17:51,932 --> 00:17:53,734
Ella.

252
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:56,770
Hey.

253
00:17:56,803 --> 00:17:58,538
You got to get to sleep,
sweetie.

254
00:17:58,572 --> 00:18:01,975
But there was
a shadow on the wall.

255
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:05,479
I know it's fun,
but it's time to sleep.

256
00:18:05,512 --> 00:18:07,648
Okay. Come on.
Scooch down, scooch down.

257
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:09,449
All the way.

258
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:10,884
Grab Bunny.

259
00:18:10,918 --> 00:18:13,553
Okay.

260
00:18:13,587 --> 00:18:14,821
Good night.

261
00:18:14,855 --> 00:18:16,924
Can you turn off the lights
for me, please?

262
00:18:16,957 --> 00:18:18,659
- Off?
- Yes.

263
00:18:18,692 --> 00:18:19,993
- You sure?
- Yes.

264
00:18:20,027 --> 00:18:21,728
Okay.

265
00:18:21,762 --> 00:18:23,697
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, Baba.

266
00:18:40,547 --> 00:18:42,783
Honey, what's the name
of the owner again?

267
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:44,551
Stetler or Statler.

268
00:18:44,584 --> 00:18:45,819
You ever talk to him?

269
00:18:45,852 --> 00:18:47,921
No, just e-mail.
I have his number, though. Why?

270
00:18:47,955 --> 00:18:49,823
Oh, thermostat's broken
downstairs.

271
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:51,558
It's gonna be cold tonight.

272
00:18:51,591 --> 00:18:52,960
- Upstairs okay?
- Yeah.

273
00:18:52,993 --> 00:18:54,594
Can you call him tomorrow?

274
00:18:54,628 --> 00:18:55,829
Can you?

275
00:18:55,862 --> 00:18:57,798
Uh, yeah, I mean, I-I could,

276
00:18:57,831 --> 00:18:59,866
but you booked it
under your name, right?

277
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,702
Yeah, of course I did.

278
00:19:01,735 --> 00:19:03,271
I'm sorry.

279
00:19:03,304 --> 00:19:05,072
I-I know I'm a pain in the ass.

280
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:06,707
Nobody would know you here.

281
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,841
You would be surprised.

282
00:19:07,874 --> 00:19:09,576
Okay.

283
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:11,511
I just don't want to deal
with all the weirdness.

284
00:19:11,545 --> 00:19:13,080
Okay, I totally get it.

285
00:19:13,113 --> 00:19:14,614
Hey.

286
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:18,518
I need to tell you something.

287
00:19:18,552 --> 00:19:20,787
I downloaded all of season three
before we left.

288
00:19:20,821 --> 00:19:23,557
I adore you.

289
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,559
Can we watch the recap first?

290
00:19:25,592 --> 00:19:28,762
Have I ever denied you
the recap?

291
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,599
I'm gonna close up downstairs.

292
00:19:32,632 --> 00:19:33,967
You do that.

293
00:19:35,836 --> 00:19:38,005
Oh. Hi, honey.

294
00:19:39,606 --> 00:19:41,708
How much did I say?

295
00:19:41,742 --> 00:19:43,744
Nothing. Totally innocuous.

296
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,063
Guess that one stays on.

297
00:20:51,711 --> 00:20:54,614
Jesus.
You got enough switches?

298
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:08,829
Previously
on <i>Credible Threat...</i>

299
00:21:24,445 --> 00:21:26,046
Hmm.

300
00:22:36,883 --> 00:22:39,119
So, as it turns out,

301
00:22:39,152 --> 00:22:43,056
there's this whole other hallway
right underneath the stairs.

302
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:44,258
Really?

303
00:22:47,295 --> 00:22:50,063
Oh, come on,
you can't be asleep yet.

304
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:55,068
Honey.

305
00:22:55,101 --> 00:22:56,304
Whoa.

306
00:22:56,337 --> 00:22:57,837
It's okay. It's okay.

307
00:22:57,871 --> 00:22:59,773
Shh. You okay?
What's going on?

308
00:22:59,806 --> 00:23:01,342
I had the worst dream.

309
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,277
Yeah? Already?

310
00:23:03,311 --> 00:23:05,011
What happened to you?

311
00:23:05,045 --> 00:23:07,281
I was turning off the lights.

312
00:23:07,315 --> 00:23:09,783
How long?

313
00:24:37,937 --> 00:24:39,407
<i>An important aspect</i>

00:25:10,438 --> 00:25:12,373

That's eavesdropping.

336
00:25:44,104 --> 00:25:45,473
Come down, please.

337
00:25:45,506 --> 00:25:46,973
I bet I can stand up.

338
00:25:47,006 --> 00:25:48,275
- Don't. No, no, no, no, no.
- I'm doing it.

339
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:49,477
Don't stand up, please.

340
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,977
- I'm doing it. Look.
- Ella. Ella.

341
00:25:52,413 --> 00:25:54,881
Are you okay?

342
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:06,993
Ella, are you sure you're okay?

343
00:26:07,026 --> 00:26:09,195
Yeah.

344
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:12,899
Why do people hate Baba so much?

345
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:21,007
You know that...
that your dad, um,

346
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,209
was married
before he and I met, right?

347
00:26:23,244 --> 00:26:24,445
Mm-hmm.

348
00:26:24,478 --> 00:26:27,080
His wife's name was Caroline.

349
00:26:27,113 --> 00:26:28,948
And she died?

350
00:26:29,983 --> 00:26:32,520
Well, the thing is...

351
00:26:32,553 --> 00:26:35,188
the thing is, um, how she died.

352
00:26:37,157 --> 00:26:39,326
<i>She died in the bathtub?</i>

353
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,195
<i>Yeah, yeah,
she drowned in the bathtub.</i>

354
00:26:42,229 --> 00:26:44,398
Why didn't she just sit up?

355
00:26:44,432 --> 00:26:46,400
Uh, well, she couldn't.

356
00:26:46,434 --> 00:26:48,436
Why not?

357
00:26:48,469 --> 00:26:50,103
Should we go back?

358
00:26:50,136 --> 00:26:51,539
No.

359
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,183
She couldn't get up,
because she was sleeping.

360
00:27:03,216 --> 00:27:04,951
That doesn't make sense.

361
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:08,154
Sometimes grown-ups
take medicine.

362
00:27:08,188 --> 00:27:10,023
Sometimes they take
too much medicine

363
00:27:10,056 --> 00:27:12,025
or they take
the wrong kind of medicine,

364
00:27:12,058 --> 00:27:14,495
a kind that they shouldn't ever
have taken at all.

365
00:27:15,362 --> 00:27:17,398
<i>And if they do,</i>

366
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:23,169
<i>they can fall asleep so hard
that they can't wake up.</i>

367
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:31,345
<i>So, Daddy came home
from work one day,</i>

368
00:27:31,378 --> 00:27:33,347
<i>and she was in the bathtub.</i>

369
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,416
And, uh...

370
00:27:35,449 --> 00:27:38,218
she had already passed away.

371
00:27:38,252 --> 00:27:40,421
There was nothing he could do.
It was an accident.

372
00:27:40,454 --> 00:27:42,222
The thing is,

373
00:27:42,256 --> 00:27:45,259
they thought he-he put her
in the tub.

374
00:27:47,561 --> 00:27:51,398
Did they... did they think
that Daddy killed her?

375
00:27:52,433 --> 00:27:53,601
Yeah.

376
00:27:58,137 --> 00:27:59,607
Did he?

377
00:28:03,511 --> 00:28:06,112
Did Daddy kill her?

378
00:28:06,145 --> 00:28:08,482
No. No.

379
00:28:11,418 --> 00:28:13,254
Okay.

380
00:28:15,154 --> 00:28:17,825
<i>Why didn't he just tell them
he didn't do it?</i>

381
00:28:17,858 --> 00:28:20,528
Well, he did, and they just
didn't believe him.

382
00:28:20,561 --> 00:28:22,496
And because Daddy was
a rich banker,

383
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,532
lots of people were
interested in his trial.

384
00:28:24,565 --> 00:28:26,233
And when it went to trial,

385
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:28,269
he was on TV,
and he got sort of famous.

386
00:28:28,302 --> 00:28:29,470
<i>What happened at the trial?</i>

387
00:28:32,138 --> 00:28:33,574
<i>The judge and the jury
all found him innocent,</i>

388
00:28:33,607 --> 00:28:35,576
<i>and they said he could go home
and start a new life,</i>

389
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:37,311
<i>but some people didn't want
to let him.</i>

390
00:28:39,246 --> 00:28:42,081
Some people think that
if you're accused,

391
00:28:42,115 --> 00:28:44,351
you must be guilty of something.

392
00:29:29,229 --> 00:29:31,097
Hello.

393
00:29:33,734 --> 00:29:35,502
Hello.

394
00:29:36,737 --> 00:29:38,305
Oh. Hi.

395
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:40,708
Good morning. Uh, afternoon.

396
00:29:40,741 --> 00:29:43,344
Uh... yeah.

397
00:29:43,377 --> 00:29:45,913
Let's see.
I-I need some, uh...

398
00:29:45,946 --> 00:29:48,649
butter, bread.

399
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:59,493
Oh. Great.

400
00:29:59,526 --> 00:30:01,261
Great.

401
00:30:01,295 --> 00:30:04,331
Yeah, uh, bread, egg...

402
00:30:06,767 --> 00:30:09,135
Okay.

403
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,746
Oh, good.
Here comes the bread.

404
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:21,548
Mm-hmm.

405
00:30:21,582 --> 00:30:23,517
And eggs.

406
00:30:28,555 --> 00:30:30,357
Got to be kidding me.

407
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,695
Looks like we got everything.

408
00:30:37,431 --> 00:30:39,400
You staying up there?

409
00:30:39,433 --> 00:30:41,268
I'm so sorry.
I don't speak Welsh.

410
00:30:41,301 --> 00:30:42,636
It's English.

411
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,804
- Oh.
- You...

412
00:30:43,837 --> 00:30:46,407
staying... up there?

413
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,775
Uh, yeah.

414
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,309
Oh.

415
00:30:49,343 --> 00:30:50,544
Uh-huh.

416
00:30:51,712 --> 00:30:53,580
Anything happened yet?

417
00:30:54,682 --> 00:30:56,684
Excuse me?

418
00:30:56,717 --> 00:30:58,485
You meet Stetler?

419
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:00,688
Is that, uh... that's the...
that's the owner, right?

420
00:31:00,721 --> 00:31:02,456
Stetler.

421
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,692
Uh, no, hmm-mm.

422
00:31:04,725 --> 00:31:06,727
Found it on the Internet.

423
00:31:07,728 --> 00:31:09,630
- Oh.
- Yeah.

424
00:31:09,663 --> 00:31:12,733
The house is... fairly new,
it seems like?

425
00:31:12,766 --> 00:31:14,535
- About four years.
- Hmm.

426
00:31:14,568 --> 00:31:16,336
What was there before?

427
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,705
Another house.

428
00:31:17,738 --> 00:31:19,239
Makes sense.

429
00:31:19,273 --> 00:31:20,741
House, then a house.

430
00:31:20,774 --> 00:31:22,776
Then a house, then a house,
then a house.

431
00:31:25,312 --> 00:31:27,715
- 26 quid.
- Great.

432
00:31:27,748 --> 00:31:29,850
26...

433
00:31:29,883 --> 00:31:31,485
There you go.

434
00:31:38,792 --> 00:31:40,494
Change?

435
00:31:41,528 --> 00:31:43,263
Credit.

436
00:31:43,297 --> 00:31:45,365
Okay, yeah. I guess we're
gonna be here a while.

437
00:31:48,368 --> 00:31:50,337
Present for you.

438
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:52,840
Try the right angles.

439
00:31:54,541 --> 00:31:56,643
Will do.

440
00:32:05,652 --> 00:32:07,788
Oh, come on.

441
00:32:11,892 --> 00:32:13,627
Hi.

442
00:32:16,396 --> 00:32:18,265
Excuse me.

443
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,770
- How'd you find the house?
- On the Internet.

444
00:32:22,803 --> 00:32:24,872
No, I never met Stetler.

445
00:32:24,905 --> 00:32:27,708
- I need to...
- You never saw Stetler?

446
00:32:27,741 --> 00:32:29,409
No.

447
00:32:30,444 --> 00:32:32,279
Well, he saw you.

448
00:32:36,683 --> 00:32:38,819
Enough with the Stetler.

449
00:32:53,901 --> 00:32:55,669
Hey, I'm back.

450
00:32:58,505 --> 00:33:00,574
Hey.

451
00:33:04,511 --> 00:33:07,514
Sorry that happened to you,
Baba.

452
00:33:08,715 --> 00:33:10,484
Shit.

453
00:33:10,517 --> 00:33:11,852
<i>Walk me through</i>

454
00:33:11,885 --> 00:33:13,921
exactly what you told her.

455
00:33:13,954 --> 00:33:15,422
I did.

456
00:33:15,455 --> 00:33:16,924
Tell me again.

457
00:33:16,957 --> 00:33:19,593
I can't remember word for word.

458
00:33:19,626 --> 00:33:21,628
But I said the stuff
that we talked about saying,

459
00:33:21,662 --> 00:33:23,764
when the time came.

460
00:33:23,797 --> 00:33:26,600
And you just decided
that the time had come.

461
00:33:26,633 --> 00:33:28,869
I didn't plan it, actually.

462
00:33:28,902 --> 00:33:30,637
She asked,
and she wouldn't let it go.

463
00:33:30,671 --> 00:33:31,638
You know how she is.

464
00:33:31,672 --> 00:33:33,607
She gave me that look
where she doesn't blink.

465
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,641
It's creepy.

466
00:33:34,675 --> 00:33:36,476
It was my story.

467
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,513
It happened to me,
and I knew exactly

468
00:33:39,546 --> 00:33:42,649
what I wanted to say to her
when it was time.

469
00:33:42,683 --> 00:33:45,452
Right, and it was time, okay?

470
00:33:45,485 --> 00:33:46,854
I couldn't lie to her.

471
00:33:46,887 --> 00:33:48,889
When she was seven...
that's what we decided.

472
00:33:48,922 --> 00:33:50,724
That is a completely
arbitrary number.

473
00:33:50,757 --> 00:33:52,459
She obviously overheard us
last night.

474
00:33:52,492 --> 00:33:54,494
She asked me point-blank.

475
00:33:55,762 --> 00:33:57,865
That's how it happened, huh?

476
00:33:57,898 --> 00:33:59,867
Yeah, that's...

477
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,603
- that is how it happened, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

478
00:34:04,605 --> 00:34:06,573
What does that mean?

479
00:34:06,607 --> 00:34:07,975
I don't know.
You know, it's just...

480
00:34:08,008 --> 00:34:09,877
sometimes it's hard to tell
what's real with you.

481
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:10,911
That's all.

482
00:34:12,512 --> 00:34:13,780
Excuse me?

483
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:22,489
You're just
a really good actress.

484
00:34:22,522 --> 00:34:23,891
That's all I'm saying.

485
00:34:23,924 --> 00:34:26,894
And you're
a passive-aggressive dick,

486
00:34:26,927 --> 00:34:28,695
is all I'm saying.

487
00:34:30,797 --> 00:34:32,399
I got to make dinner.

488
00:34:35,035 --> 00:34:36,770
That supposed to be meat?

489
00:34:36,803 --> 00:34:38,639
Think there's a lot of options
down there

490
00:34:38,672 --> 00:34:40,207
in the village of the damned?

491
00:34:40,241 --> 00:34:42,009
No olives?

492
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:43,777
You chose this place, not me.

493
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:45,545
No, I didn't.
You sent me the link.

494
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:47,481
I absolutely did not.
You sent it to me.

495
00:34:47,514 --> 00:34:48,849
All right, can...
can we please stop?

496
00:34:48,882 --> 00:34:50,684
Who would have imagined
that they don't have

497
00:34:50,717 --> 00:34:52,786
the Whole Foods olive bar
in Wales?

498
00:34:52,819 --> 00:34:55,422
Let me know when you're done
being an asshole.

499
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:59,559
Yeah. Go get on your phone.

500
00:35:55,048 --> 00:35:56,783
Thank you, Ella.

501
00:35:56,817 --> 00:35:58,719
You're welcome, Baba.

502
00:36:01,621 --> 00:36:02,990
Look.

503
00:36:04,758 --> 00:36:05,993
Cool.

504
00:36:06,026 --> 00:36:08,829
Thanks.

505
00:37:59,139 --> 00:38:01,842
Honey, uh...

506
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:04,744
- do you need shampoo?
- What?

507
00:38:06,447 --> 00:38:09,216
Shampoo.
Uh, do you need any shampoo?

508
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,218
I have some.

509
00:38:11,252 --> 00:38:13,086
Oh, okay, so...

510
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,256
so you are washing your hair.

511
00:38:15,289 --> 00:38:16,857
Huh?

512
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:19,059
Nothing.
Not... not important.

513
00:38:19,092 --> 00:38:21,995
Honey, I can't hear anything
that you're saying.

514
00:38:22,028 --> 00:38:24,965
You can talk,
but you come in here.

515
00:38:24,998 --> 00:38:27,200
No, never mind.

516
00:38:29,035 --> 00:38:33,006
Was there enough, uh, hot water?

517
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:34,741
What are you doing?

518
00:38:34,774 --> 00:38:36,743
Never mind. All good.

519
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:01,168
I'm done.

520
00:39:01,201 --> 00:39:03,203
With what?

521
00:39:03,237 --> 00:39:05,805
Being an asshole.

522
00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:11,178
You know,
I've-I've had this cloud

523
00:39:11,211 --> 00:39:13,713
that's been hanging over me
for a while now,

524
00:39:13,747 --> 00:39:15,316
and I've just been
an idiot about it.

525
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:17,217
But I'm done with all that now.

526
00:39:17,251 --> 00:39:19,986
It was... it was stupid.
I'm sorry.

527
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,788
About Ella?

528
00:39:22,822 --> 00:39:24,191
Yeah.

529
00:39:24,224 --> 00:39:27,961
Yeah, you handled it...
just right, sounds like.

530
00:39:27,994 --> 00:39:30,197
B-Better than I could've.

531
00:39:30,231 --> 00:39:33,334
You should've seen the way
she looked at me after dinner.

532
00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:35,835
She loves her Baba.

533
00:39:37,904 --> 00:39:40,907
I'm really sorry
for thinking ill of you.

534
00:39:40,941 --> 00:39:43,344
It was a sin. I regret it.

535
00:39:43,377 --> 00:39:46,780
Catholic school
fucked you up good.

536
00:39:46,813 --> 00:39:48,815
Yeah.

537
00:39:50,318 --> 00:39:53,153
That was a half-decent apology.
Thank you.

538
00:40:13,206 --> 00:40:15,108
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

539
00:40:15,141 --> 00:40:17,143
I'm good. I'm good, honey.
Just go back to sleep.

540
00:40:17,177 --> 00:40:18,613
Okay.

541
00:40:22,882 --> 00:40:26,219
<i>The clear expression
of your thoughts and feelings</i>

542
00:40:26,254 --> 00:40:29,155
<i>is essential
to any relationship.</i>

543
00:40:30,924 --> 00:40:34,861
<i>Emotional truth
is the only pathway to peace.</i>

544
00:40:34,894 --> 00:40:37,231
Suspicion and mistrust

545
00:40:37,265 --> 00:40:40,133
are merely impulses of energy,

546
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:42,902
and they are not always
under your control.

547
00:40:46,873 --> 00:40:48,875
Then again,

548
00:40:48,908 --> 00:40:52,946
sometimes those feelings
are based in fact.

549
00:43:16,457 --> 00:43:17,957
Hello?

550
00:43:18,992 --> 00:43:19,993
Hello?

551
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,368
Hello?

552
00:43:29,403 --> 00:43:32,339
Hello.

553
00:43:41,782 --> 00:43:43,551
Okay. Okay, no, no.

554
00:43:43,584 --> 00:43:46,253
This can't be happening.

555
00:43:46,287 --> 00:43:49,423
No, this is definitely
not happening.

556
00:43:50,491 --> 00:43:52,293
Ella?

557
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,061
Oh, my God.

558
00:43:58,499 --> 00:44:00,334
Ella!

559
00:44:01,602 --> 00:44:03,571
Oh! Oh, my God!

560
00:44:03,604 --> 00:44:05,071
Ella!

561
00:44:05,104 --> 00:44:06,340
No. Ella.

562
00:44:06,373 --> 00:44:07,508
Oh, God.

563
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:09,209
Oh, my God.

564
00:44:09,243 --> 00:44:10,578
No.

565
00:44:10,611 --> 00:44:12,346
Oh, God.

566
00:44:12,379 --> 00:44:13,481
Oh...

567
00:44:15,316 --> 00:44:17,050
Oh, God.

568
00:44:18,151 --> 00:44:19,253
Honey, honey.

569
00:44:19,286 --> 00:44:20,521
Wake up, wake up.

570
00:44:22,088 --> 00:44:25,091
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no. No.

571
00:44:25,124 --> 00:44:26,627
Oh! Oh!

572
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,562
You're dreaming. Dreaming.

573
00:44:28,596 --> 00:44:30,096
Wake up! Wake up!

574
00:44:30,129 --> 00:44:31,164
Wake up!

575
00:44:33,066 --> 00:44:34,502
It's a dream.

576
00:44:34,535 --> 00:44:36,102
It's a dream!

577
00:44:36,135 --> 00:44:38,405
It's a goddamn dream!

578
00:44:54,288 --> 00:44:57,123
Fucking nightmares.

579
00:44:58,526 --> 00:45:00,394
Oh, boy.

580
00:45:00,427 --> 00:45:02,496
I just had a really bad dream.

581
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:04,632
Oh, yeah?

582
00:45:04,665 --> 00:45:07,401
I was onstage, and I...

583
00:45:07,434 --> 00:45:10,136
there was a huge audience,
and I didn't even know the play.

584
00:45:10,169 --> 00:45:11,372
Like, I didn't have a clue.

585
00:45:11,405 --> 00:45:13,240
I hate those dreams.

586
00:45:13,274 --> 00:45:15,342
I think I got you beat.

587
00:45:17,344 --> 00:45:19,680
Oh, it's really nice in here.

588
00:45:19,713 --> 00:45:22,249
Okay, that's encouraging.

589
00:45:22,283 --> 00:45:23,417
Two doors.

590
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:24,585
What, last night
there were three?

591
00:45:24,618 --> 00:45:26,119
Yeah, there was another one

592
00:45:26,152 --> 00:45:27,220
right behind
this bookshelf here.

593
00:45:27,254 --> 00:45:28,489
Went to this staircase,

594
00:45:28,522 --> 00:45:30,658
and then-then there was
this weird kind of hall

595
00:45:30,691 --> 00:45:33,561
that went around and led
to a place... under the house.

596
00:45:33,594 --> 00:45:35,863
And Ella...
God, it was horrible.

597
00:45:35,896 --> 00:45:38,097
What's behind this door?

598
00:45:40,133 --> 00:45:42,636
This is where the washer is.

599
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:45,472
God, this is
a gigantic laundry room.

600
00:45:45,506 --> 00:45:48,107
This is it right here
from the dream.

601
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:51,579
Oh, sure, that's a bummer.

602
00:45:51,612 --> 00:45:55,282
Okay, so, um,
you saw the picture,

603
00:45:55,316 --> 00:45:57,518
and then you put it all
in your dream.

604
00:45:57,551 --> 00:45:59,218
Okay, okay,
but-but at what point

605
00:45:59,253 --> 00:46:00,554
did I actually fall asleep?

606
00:46:00,588 --> 00:46:02,423
Immediately after sex,
like always.

607
00:46:02,456 --> 00:46:05,693
You did. You did.

608
00:46:05,726 --> 00:46:08,729
You don't remember me getting up
and leaving the bedroom?

609
00:46:08,762 --> 00:46:10,664
Hmm-mm. I don't know.

610
00:46:10,698 --> 00:46:12,333
I don't think so.

611
00:46:12,366 --> 00:46:14,335
Mm, no. I don't think so.

612
00:46:14,368 --> 00:46:15,603
I would've woken up.

613
00:46:15,636 --> 00:46:17,638
You're not very good
at sneaking around.

614
00:46:17,671 --> 00:46:21,207
So everything from the time
I got out of bed was a dream.

615
00:46:21,241 --> 00:46:23,243
Sounds like it.

616
00:46:25,346 --> 00:46:27,381
And I never went downstairs?

617
00:46:27,414 --> 00:46:29,650
Nope.

618
00:46:31,318 --> 00:46:33,219
Do you like it here?

619
00:46:33,253 --> 00:46:34,521
In this room?

620
00:46:34,555 --> 00:46:36,323
This house.

621
00:46:37,391 --> 00:46:39,192
No. Do you?

622
00:46:39,226 --> 00:46:40,661
I hate it.

623
00:46:42,229 --> 00:46:43,597
But we just got here.

624
00:46:43,631 --> 00:46:46,467
I know, but sometimes
when you pick something online,

625
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,167
you don't really know
what you're getting,

626
00:46:48,201 --> 00:46:49,637
and you make a mistake.
It happens.

627
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:51,772
Where are we gonna go now?

628
00:46:51,805 --> 00:46:54,575
Hotel for a little while,
someplace really fun.

629
00:46:54,608 --> 00:46:56,777
The important thing is that
we'll all be together

630
00:46:56,810 --> 00:47:00,247
before I have to start work
and you and your dad go home.

631
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,516
But how long will you be gone?

632
00:47:02,549 --> 00:47:03,684
Eight weeks.

633
00:47:03,717 --> 00:47:05,953
That's a really long time.

634
00:47:05,986 --> 00:47:08,422
I know, but you and your dad
are gonna come visit

635
00:47:08,455 --> 00:47:09,723
halfway through,
like we talked about.

636
00:47:09,757 --> 00:47:11,759
Why can't we just be with you
the whole time?

637
00:47:11,792 --> 00:47:13,394
Let's just go outside
and run around

638
00:47:13,427 --> 00:47:14,962
before we have to get
in the car.

639
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:19,266
Seven, eight,
nine, ten, here I come!

640
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,269
Darn it.

641
00:49:24,424 --> 00:49:26,426
I didn't dream that.

642
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:42,709
Got you!

643
00:49:47,981 --> 00:49:50,317
You're so slippery!

644
00:49:51,485 --> 00:49:52,686
Hey.

645
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:54,321
Hi, Baba.

646
00:49:55,589 --> 00:49:56,957
Susanna, come here a sec.

647
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:59,827
- What is it?
- Come play with us.

648
00:50:00,861 --> 00:50:02,563
I want to talk to Mommy first.

649
00:50:05,866 --> 00:50:08,969
Baba can be weird sometimes.

650
00:50:09,002 --> 00:50:10,804
- Ella, go inside.
- Why?

651
00:50:10,838 --> 00:50:12,506
Because it's gonna rain.

652
00:50:18,445 --> 00:50:20,547
You ready to go?

653
00:50:21,682 --> 00:50:23,584
What is it?

654
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:31,959
You have two phones.

655
00:50:35,662 --> 00:50:37,631
Must have been a lot of work

656
00:50:37,664 --> 00:50:40,434
keeping track of two
of those things.

657
00:50:44,771 --> 00:50:46,807
Yeah, it's exhausting.

658
00:50:50,878 --> 00:50:54,514
The guy, Max,
from the shoot in Mexico?

659
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:58,418
Yeah.

660
00:50:59,653 --> 00:51:01,655
That's too bad.

661
00:51:05,792 --> 00:51:09,029
Has he been here, in this house?

662
00:51:09,062 --> 00:51:11,698
Of course... of course not.

663
00:51:11,732 --> 00:51:13,200
Because somebody wrote
in my journal.

664
00:51:13,234 --> 00:51:14,635
He's not here.

665
00:51:14,668 --> 00:51:16,503
He's in New York.
He has meetings.

666
00:51:16,536 --> 00:51:18,705
I don't give a shit
where Max has meetings.

667
00:51:18,739 --> 00:51:19,873
I'm sorry.

668
00:51:19,907 --> 00:51:22,509
So, who wrote in my book?

669
00:51:22,542 --> 00:51:25,012
Um, I don't know.
Uh, did Ella?

670
00:51:25,045 --> 00:51:27,447
Is that the biggest problem
we have right now?

671
00:51:28,815 --> 00:51:31,818
I bet that guy can fuck you
all night, huh?

672
00:51:32,853 --> 00:51:34,922
Don't make it ugly.

673
00:51:34,955 --> 00:51:38,625
I'm 100% sure that I am not
the one that made this ugly.

674
00:51:38,659 --> 00:51:40,861
I can't do this.

675
00:51:40,894 --> 00:51:43,463
If only you'd said that to Max.

676
00:51:43,497 --> 00:51:44,932
You know, it'd feel a lot better

677
00:51:44,965 --> 00:51:47,701
if you yelled and screamed
like a normal person.

678
00:51:49,569 --> 00:51:51,438
No, thanks.

679
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:54,541
You got to go.

680
00:51:55,676 --> 00:51:57,611
What? Where?

681
00:51:57,644 --> 00:51:59,046
I don't know.

682
00:51:59,079 --> 00:52:00,948
Not here.
Stay in the village.

683
00:52:00,981 --> 00:52:02,683
I'm not staying
in the fucking village.

684
00:52:02,716 --> 00:52:04,685
- You go if you want to.
- No, you leave.

685
00:52:04,718 --> 00:52:06,019
Fine. I'll take Ella.

686
00:52:07,054 --> 00:52:09,056
Like hell you will.

687
00:52:09,089 --> 00:52:11,992
You-you're not making
the rules now.

688
00:52:12,025 --> 00:52:14,561
You broke the rules.

689
00:52:14,594 --> 00:52:16,663
There are no rules anymore.

690
00:52:37,017 --> 00:52:38,752
Other side.

691
00:52:40,087 --> 00:52:42,522
How long am I supposed to stay
in purgatory?

692
00:52:42,556 --> 00:52:43,957
I just need a night to myself.

693
00:52:43,991 --> 00:52:45,993
- So do you.
- Don't tell me what I need.

694
00:52:46,026 --> 00:52:47,894
A night by yourself.

695
00:52:47,928 --> 00:52:49,896
Yes, Theo, I get it...
by myself.

696
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:52,699
Max is not here.
He has never been here.

697
00:52:52,733 --> 00:52:55,002
Oh, right, 'cause of all
the big meetings in New York.

698
00:52:55,035 --> 00:52:56,970
Can I get in, please?

699
00:52:57,004 --> 00:52:59,940
Hey, listen, um,
you know, I want to take back

700
00:52:59,973 --> 00:53:02,943
that "fuck you all night"
thing I said.

701
00:53:02,976 --> 00:53:04,978
- Yeah, whatever.
- Yeah, let me be clear...

702
00:53:05,012 --> 00:53:06,880
I don't actually care
who fucks you all night.

703
00:53:06,913 --> 00:53:08,982
- Oh, my God. Jesus.
- I'm sure it's quite a list.

704
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:16,056
Drive safe, sweetie.

705
00:53:24,931 --> 00:53:27,901
Hey, do you have
both your phones?

706
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:26,827
They didn't have
any peanut butter.

707
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:29,062
- Why not?
- It's not a thing here.

708
00:54:29,096 --> 00:54:31,965
- So, what's that stuff?
- I don't know.

709
00:54:31,998 --> 00:54:34,868
Starts with L.
Well, two L's, actually.

710
00:54:34,901 --> 00:54:36,736
I don't want it.

711
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,775
- It's pretty good.
- No, it isn't.

712
00:54:41,808 --> 00:54:43,743
Okay, it's not pretty good.

713
00:54:43,777 --> 00:54:45,679
It tastes kind of weird.

714
00:54:45,712 --> 00:54:49,049
But it's not poison,
and it's what we have.

715
00:54:49,082 --> 00:54:51,118
- I'm not eating it.
- Could you please

716
00:54:51,151 --> 00:54:53,653
just stop with the scooter
for one second, honey?

717
00:54:53,687 --> 00:54:55,989
So you might as well just

718
00:54:56,022 --> 00:54:58,758
throw it in
the garbage can for me

719
00:54:58,792 --> 00:55:00,694
because I'm just not
gonna eat it.

720
00:55:00,727 --> 00:55:02,863
Honey, could you please
get off the scooter?

721
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:05,999
I'm sorry.

722
00:55:06,032 --> 00:55:07,901
Sorry.

723
00:55:07,934 --> 00:55:09,237
It's okay. It's okay.

724
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:12,038
Honey, it's okay.

725
00:55:19,713 --> 00:55:21,249
I don't like it here.

726
00:55:22,916 --> 00:55:24,784
I don't think I do, either.

727
00:55:24,818 --> 00:55:28,188
I have weird dreams,
and I get in bad moods.

728
00:55:28,221 --> 00:55:29,956
Me, too.

729
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:32,859
Did you and Mommy have a fight?

730
00:55:36,096 --> 00:55:37,898
Yeah.

731
00:55:37,931 --> 00:55:40,767
Today is a terrible day.

732
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,471
- I want to go home.
- So do I.

733
00:55:43,504 --> 00:55:46,840
As soon as Mom gets back
with the car, okay?

734
00:55:46,873 --> 00:55:49,209
- When will that be?
- Tomorrow.

735
00:56:00,288 --> 00:56:02,088
Hmm.

736
00:56:07,827 --> 00:56:09,230
Huh.

737
00:56:14,235 --> 00:56:16,803
- What are you doing?
- Experiment.

738
00:56:16,836 --> 00:56:19,973
- What kind of experiment?
- Water experiment.

739
00:56:32,052 --> 00:56:34,054
That's freaky.

740
00:56:34,087 --> 00:56:35,256
I'll say.

741
00:56:41,295 --> 00:56:43,063
What's that?

742
00:56:43,096 --> 00:56:44,298
It's a triangle.

743
00:56:44,332 --> 00:56:46,234
I'm checking the angles.

744
00:56:46,267 --> 00:56:48,336
Why you want to check angles?

745
00:56:48,369 --> 00:56:50,937
These are all very
heads-up questions, honey.

746
00:56:55,376 --> 00:56:57,744
Huh.

747
00:57:00,281 --> 00:57:02,250
Does this wall
look right to you?

748
00:57:02,283 --> 00:57:04,252
Um...

749
00:57:04,285 --> 00:57:08,121
it looks like a wall to me.

750
00:57:08,154 --> 00:57:10,291
Can't tell from in here.

751
00:57:17,063 --> 00:57:20,000
What are you looking for?

752
00:57:20,033 --> 00:57:22,068
I don't know.

753
00:57:23,103 --> 00:57:24,405
16, seven,

754
00:57:24,438 --> 00:57:26,407
12, zero.

755
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,041
Honey, honey, honey.

756
00:57:28,074 --> 00:57:29,843
You taught me that.

757
00:57:29,876 --> 00:57:32,879
16! 17! 18!

758
00:57:32,912 --> 00:57:34,282
- Okay, you got me.
- One!

759
00:57:34,315 --> 00:57:35,915
Yay!

760
00:57:41,888 --> 00:57:43,758
- Hang on tight, honey.
- Okay.

761
00:57:45,326 --> 00:57:47,861
- Don't let go.
- Okay.

762
00:57:51,164 --> 00:57:53,099
26 feet.

763
00:57:53,133 --> 00:57:55,168
- Hold on tight.
- Okay.

764
00:58:01,409 --> 00:58:03,143
21.

765
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:05,413
Are you at the corner?

766
00:58:05,446 --> 00:58:07,113
- Yeah.
- You sure?

767
00:58:07,147 --> 00:58:08,282
Yeah.

768
00:58:08,316 --> 00:58:09,350
You can let go.

769
00:58:10,384 --> 00:58:12,286
What does it say?

770
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,922
Says this room is
five feet longer on the inside

771
00:58:15,955 --> 00:58:17,857
than it is on the outside.

772
00:58:20,227 --> 00:58:22,363
Wait. How does that work?

773
00:58:23,997 --> 00:58:25,399
It doesn't.

774
00:58:25,433 --> 00:58:27,100
I'm cold.

775
00:58:27,133 --> 00:58:28,369
Get your coat on, hon.

776
00:58:28,402 --> 00:58:30,070
Okay.

777
00:59:08,275 --> 00:59:10,009
Ella?

778
00:59:12,713 --> 00:59:14,248
Ella.

779
00:59:21,955 --> 00:59:23,424
Ella.

780
00:59:27,961 --> 00:59:30,498
So not in the mood
for hide-and-seek.

781
00:59:34,033 --> 00:59:35,902
Ella!

782
00:59:43,344 --> 00:59:45,111
Ella.

783
00:59:47,515 --> 00:59:49,517
I give up, honey.

784
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:51,151
You win.

785
00:59:51,184 --> 00:59:53,086
Ella.

786
00:59:59,226 --> 01:00:00,960
Ella?

787
01:00:12,205 --> 01:00:13,541
Okay, Ella, it's not funny.

788
01:00:13,574 --> 01:00:15,309
Come out, please.

789
01:00:17,177 --> 01:00:18,546
Baba?

790
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:27,321
Baba.

791
01:00:31,358 --> 01:00:33,159
Ella.

792
01:00:45,372 --> 01:00:47,207
What the hell?

793
01:01:14,368 --> 01:01:16,202
Baba?

794
01:01:18,137 --> 01:01:20,006
Are you there?

795
01:01:27,615 --> 01:01:29,250
Baba?

796
01:01:44,265 --> 01:01:46,099
Ella?

797
01:01:59,313 --> 01:02:01,114
Oh, God.

798
01:02:21,468 --> 01:02:23,337
Hello?

799
01:02:26,473 --> 01:02:29,075
Is anybody down here?

800
01:02:33,647 --> 01:02:36,182
I got lost.

801
01:02:52,232 --> 01:02:54,234
Hello?

802
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:01,508
Who are you?

803
01:03:06,413 --> 01:03:08,248
Can you hear me?

804
01:03:09,683 --> 01:03:12,151
Are you okay?

805
01:03:17,491 --> 01:03:19,226
Ella.

806
01:03:22,763 --> 01:03:26,467
What an innocent face.

807
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:31,572
We don't get that much here.

808
01:03:32,606 --> 01:03:34,375
Such a lucky daddy.

809
01:03:34,408 --> 01:03:38,177
I bet you'd stay with him
forever, wouldn't you?

810
01:03:44,351 --> 01:03:46,387
- Ella!
- Baba!

811
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:53,192
Daddy, where are you?

812
01:03:53,227 --> 01:03:54,662
Ella?

813
01:03:54,695 --> 01:03:56,764
- Ella!
- Baba, I'm scared.

814
01:03:56,797 --> 01:03:58,265
Stay back from the door!

815
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,502
Baba, please, please.

816
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,736
Baba!

817
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,742
Oh, Jesus.

818
01:04:08,776 --> 01:04:11,345
Ella. Honey, are you okay?

819
01:04:11,378 --> 01:04:13,681
- I got... I got lost.
- Oh, baby.

820
01:04:13,714 --> 01:04:15,416
I got lost in the house.

821
01:04:15,449 --> 01:04:17,251
I know. I know.
I got you now.

822
01:04:17,284 --> 01:04:18,819
- I was looking for you everywhere.
- I know.

823
01:04:18,852 --> 01:04:20,788
I know, my love.
It's okay. It's okay.

824
01:04:20,821 --> 01:04:23,257
- I was scared.
- I know. I know.

825
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:25,325
- I got you.
- I couldn't find you.

826
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:26,694
I got you now.

827
01:04:30,531 --> 01:04:33,300
You're okay now.
All right?

828
01:04:33,333 --> 01:04:37,438
You and me, we're not getting
out of each other's sight again.

829
01:04:37,471 --> 01:04:39,306
All right?
That's a deal.

830
01:04:39,339 --> 01:04:40,808
I want to go home.

831
01:04:41,842 --> 01:04:43,277
We will.

832
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:45,312
- Promise?
- Yeah. Yep.

833
01:04:45,345 --> 01:04:47,414
Yeah. I promise.

834
01:04:47,448 --> 01:04:49,316
- I'm just gonna call...
- Wait!

835
01:04:49,349 --> 01:04:51,585
Okay, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm just gonna call your mom,

836
01:04:51,618 --> 01:04:53,420
and she's gonna come right now,

837
01:04:53,454 --> 01:04:55,823
and she's gonna pick us up,
okay?

838
01:04:58,325 --> 01:04:59,493
Hey, it's me.

839
01:04:59,526 --> 01:05:00,761
Um, leave me a message.

840
01:05:02,429 --> 01:05:04,832
Her phone is off
or she's out of range.

841
01:05:04,865 --> 01:05:07,334
Why don't you call
her other phone?

842
01:05:10,571 --> 01:05:13,440
Uh... I don't have that number.

843
01:05:14,475 --> 01:05:16,577
Oh.

844
01:05:16,610 --> 01:05:19,246
All right,
I-I'm gonna try her again.

845
01:05:20,748 --> 01:05:23,617
Hey, it's me.
Um, leave me a message.

846
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:25,853
Hey, uh, it's me.

847
01:05:25,886 --> 01:05:27,788
Call me when you get this,

848
01:05:27,821 --> 01:05:29,857
as soon as you get it.

849
01:05:32,793 --> 01:05:35,629
Uh, okay.

850
01:05:35,662 --> 01:05:38,432
This is not a problem.

851
01:05:38,465 --> 01:05:40,467
Okay.

852
01:05:42,703 --> 01:05:45,639
All right, yeah, it's a...
it's a little bit of a problem.

853
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:49,743
But I got an idea.

854
01:05:49,777 --> 01:05:51,478
Aha!

855
01:05:51,512 --> 01:05:52,780
All right.

856
01:05:52,813 --> 01:05:54,381
We are out of here.

857
01:05:54,414 --> 01:05:56,850
We are so out of here.

858
01:06:07,561 --> 01:06:08,729
They don't answer?

859
01:06:08,762 --> 01:06:10,364
Uh, just give him a minute.

860
01:06:10,397 --> 01:06:11,899
This guy's kind of slow.

861
01:06:20,707 --> 01:06:21,875
Hello.

862
01:06:21,909 --> 01:06:23,911
Hello. Hi.
Uh, this is Theo Conroy.

863
01:06:23,944 --> 01:06:25,712
I was in the other day.

864
01:06:25,746 --> 01:06:29,383
Uh, we-we rented the house
u-up the hill.

865
01:06:29,416 --> 01:06:30,784
Where?

866
01:06:30,818 --> 01:06:32,486
Stetler. The Stetler house.

867
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:33,921
We rented Stetler's house.

868
01:06:33,954 --> 01:06:35,923
I remember.

869
01:06:35,956 --> 01:06:38,559
- We need a taxi.
- A what?

870
01:06:38,592 --> 01:06:39,927
A taxi.

871
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:42,629
W-We need somebody
to come pick us up.

872
01:06:42,663 --> 01:06:44,765
There are no taxis around here.

873
01:06:44,798 --> 01:06:45,966
Well, where, then?

874
01:06:45,999 --> 01:06:47,634
Marlborough Inn, maybe.

875
01:06:47,668 --> 01:06:49,369
Unless he's still on holiday.

876
01:06:49,403 --> 01:06:52,339
Okay, uh, could you give me
that number, please?

877
01:06:53,173 --> 01:06:54,708
Hello?

878
01:06:54,741 --> 01:06:57,644
Did you try the triangle?

879
01:07:00,681 --> 01:07:02,449
Yes.

880
01:07:02,482 --> 01:07:04,484
I tried the triangle.

881
01:07:04,518 --> 01:07:06,954
They never fit
the angles up there.

882
01:07:06,987 --> 01:07:08,789
Why not?

883
01:07:08,822 --> 01:07:10,824
What is this place?

884
01:07:10,858 --> 01:07:13,760
Somebody from here, Hans Eagly,

885
01:07:13,794 --> 01:07:15,829
he owns the Lindenhof.

886
01:07:15,863 --> 01:07:19,933
He said an ant doesn't know
what a cathedral is

887
01:07:19,967 --> 01:07:23,570
or a power plant or a volcano.

888
01:07:23,604 --> 01:07:26,540
It's the same with that house.

889
01:07:26,573 --> 01:07:29,409
You don't know
what you can't know.

890
01:07:31,645 --> 01:07:33,013
Are you still there?

891
01:07:33,046 --> 01:07:34,648
We need a taxi now.

892
01:07:34,681 --> 01:07:35,916
Don't shout at me.

893
01:07:35,949 --> 01:07:37,718
I'm not... shouting.

894
01:07:37,751 --> 01:07:40,487
There was a different house
before that one.

895
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,489
What sort of house?

896
01:07:42,522 --> 01:07:43,991
Just different.

897
01:07:44,024 --> 01:07:46,927
And before that, a tower.

898
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,195
Tower?

899
01:07:48,229 --> 01:07:50,497
It's a legend.

900
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:54,001
The Devil builds a tower
to collect souls,

901
01:07:54,034 --> 01:07:56,570
and God destroys it.

902
01:07:56,603 --> 01:08:01,008
But the Devil just builds it up
again and again.

903
01:08:01,041 --> 01:08:04,544
People have always stayed
in that house.

904
01:08:04,578 --> 01:08:05,979
Some don't leave.

905
01:08:06,013 --> 01:08:08,682
The right ones
usually find the place.

906
01:08:08,715 --> 01:08:10,918
Or perhaps it's
the other way around.

907
01:08:10,951 --> 01:08:13,020
The place finds them.

908
01:08:13,053 --> 01:08:14,922
We need to leave now.

909
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:18,458
That's not up to me.

910
01:08:18,492 --> 01:08:19,993
Hello?

911
01:08:20,027 --> 01:08:20,994
Hello!

912
01:08:21,028 --> 01:08:23,563
I'm here.

913
01:08:23,597 --> 01:08:25,832
I'm always here.

914
01:08:31,838 --> 01:08:33,807
- How far is the village?
- It's pretty far.

915
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,809
It's about four miles.

916
01:08:35,842 --> 01:08:37,245
But it's dark.

917
01:08:37,278 --> 01:08:39,546
- Yep.
- And cold.

918
01:08:39,579 --> 01:08:41,048
Would you rather stay here?

919
01:08:41,081 --> 01:08:43,583
- No.
- Me, neither.

920
01:08:44,985 --> 01:08:46,887
- But what about our stuff?
- We'll get new stuff.

921
01:08:50,057 --> 01:08:51,591
Oh, no.

922
01:08:53,627 --> 01:08:55,462
Why don't you unlock the door?

923
01:09:08,608 --> 01:09:10,577
Are you sure you know the way?

924
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:13,013
Yep. Just one road,

925
01:09:13,046 --> 01:09:15,515
right down straight into town.

926
01:09:21,088 --> 01:09:23,090
There's
somebody inside the house.

927
01:09:29,029 --> 01:09:30,097
Okay, up.

928
01:09:31,631 --> 01:09:32,866
Baba, what's happening?

929
01:09:32,899 --> 01:09:34,501
Let's go.

930
01:09:42,776 --> 01:09:44,745
- I'm cold.
- I know.

931
01:09:44,778 --> 01:09:47,014
It's cold, but we're okay.

932
01:09:47,047 --> 01:09:48,715
I can walk.

933
01:09:48,749 --> 01:09:50,784
I got you, honey. I got you.

934
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,689
It's freezing.

935
01:09:55,722 --> 01:09:57,657
Hey. You're doing great.

936
01:10:01,728 --> 01:10:03,130
Honey, I-I got to
put you down, okay?

937
01:10:03,163 --> 01:10:04,664
Okay.

938
01:10:08,935 --> 01:10:10,704
Are you sure you know
where we're going?

939
01:10:10,737 --> 01:10:14,007
Yeah. Just one road,
right into town.

940
01:10:16,977 --> 01:10:19,012
What was that?

941
01:10:24,017 --> 01:10:25,786
- What was that?
- Uh, it was nothing, honey.

942
01:10:25,819 --> 01:10:26,920
It was just an animal, animal.

943
01:10:26,953 --> 01:10:29,689
- Okay.
- Just a-a deer, something.

944
01:10:29,723 --> 01:10:31,359
Okay, up you go.

945
01:10:46,706 --> 01:10:48,675
Almost there, honey.

946
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:50,077
Not much further.

947
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:53,013
I can't... I can't feel my toes.

948
01:10:53,046 --> 01:10:54,948
Maybe they'll have a fire.

949
01:10:57,918 --> 01:11:00,954
I've never been
this c-cold before.

950
01:11:00,987 --> 01:11:03,056
You never lived in Chicago.

951
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:04,925
How much farther is it?

952
01:11:04,958 --> 01:11:07,094
I'm starting to see lights.

953
01:11:07,127 --> 01:11:09,096
It's... cold.

954
01:11:09,129 --> 01:11:10,797
Yeah.

955
01:11:12,199 --> 01:11:14,601
I'm definitely seeing
some lights.

956
01:11:17,838 --> 01:11:19,673
We made it.

957
01:11:21,875 --> 01:11:23,743
We did it.

958
01:11:23,777 --> 01:11:25,779
We did it, honey.

959
01:11:25,812 --> 01:11:27,881
We're there.

960
01:11:27,914 --> 01:11:29,716
We're...

961
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:35,856
We're back.

962
01:11:35,889 --> 01:11:37,891
What?

963
01:11:44,197 --> 01:11:45,266
We're back.

964
01:11:45,299 --> 01:11:46,800
But...

965
01:11:46,833 --> 01:11:49,970
But we were going down
the whole time.

966
01:11:50,003 --> 01:11:51,905
I'll explain it to you
in the morning.

967
01:11:51,938 --> 01:11:54,174
- It's complicated.
- No, it isn't.

968
01:11:54,207 --> 01:11:58,011
We were walking d-down
the whole time.

969
01:11:58,044 --> 01:12:00,147
I don't want to go in there.

970
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:01,848
We don't have a choice.

971
01:12:01,882 --> 01:12:03,284
I'm not going in there.

972
01:12:03,317 --> 01:12:06,086
- Honey...
- I hate that house!

973
01:12:06,119 --> 01:12:08,922
- It's too cold out here, honey.
- No. No!

974
01:12:08,955 --> 01:12:12,125
Your mom's gonna be here
in the morning with the car.

975
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:13,693
Please don't make me
go in there.

976
01:12:15,729 --> 01:12:17,731
Listen to me.

977
01:12:19,766 --> 01:12:22,903
We would not make it out here.

978
01:12:22,936 --> 01:12:25,038
Not all night.

979
01:12:25,071 --> 01:12:27,073
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

980
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:33,180
I will protect you.

981
01:12:33,213 --> 01:12:35,283
I'm gonna make sure...

982
01:12:35,316 --> 01:12:38,018
that nothing happens to you.

983
01:12:38,051 --> 01:12:40,488
I'm gonna protect you.

984
01:12:40,521 --> 01:12:42,989
Okay? Do you trust me?

985
01:12:43,023 --> 01:12:45,293
I-I trust you.

986
01:12:45,326 --> 01:12:47,295
One more night.

987
01:12:47,328 --> 01:12:49,196
Just one more night.

988
01:12:49,230 --> 01:12:50,797
We can do it.

989
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:53,301
Okay?
Let's go. Let's go.

990
01:13:08,982 --> 01:13:10,850
Okay? Feeling better?

991
01:13:10,884 --> 01:13:12,320
It's warm now, right?

992
01:13:12,353 --> 01:13:14,054
I'm not going anywhere.

993
01:13:14,087 --> 01:13:16,723
Just try and get some sleep,
honey.

994
01:13:17,391 --> 01:13:19,025
Daddy?

995
01:13:19,059 --> 01:13:20,261
Yes, my love.

996
01:13:20,294 --> 01:13:22,062
You still love Mommy?

997
01:13:22,095 --> 01:13:23,331
Yeah.

998
01:13:23,364 --> 01:13:25,165
I do.

999
01:13:25,198 --> 01:13:27,535
But not enough?

1000
01:13:27,568 --> 01:13:30,837
Well, s-sweetie, uh...

1001
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:34,342
I never really deserved
to have your mom.

1002
01:13:34,375 --> 01:13:37,278
What about me?

1003
01:13:38,945 --> 01:13:40,146
What about you?

1004
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:42,983
Do you love me enough?

1005
01:13:44,851 --> 01:13:47,120
Aw.

1006
01:13:47,153 --> 01:13:49,357
You know...

1007
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:51,359
when I was young...

1008
01:13:51,392 --> 01:13:55,329
things came pretty easy for me,

1009
01:13:55,363 --> 01:13:57,998
and-and-and really quick, like,

1010
01:13:58,031 --> 01:13:59,966
success and money.

1011
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,369
Stuff like that.

1012
01:14:01,402 --> 01:14:03,371
And I think I...

1013
01:14:03,404 --> 01:14:05,872
I kind of lost track

1014
01:14:05,905 --> 01:14:09,843
of who I was, you know, and...

1015
01:14:09,876 --> 01:14:14,848
I became someone that
I wasn't really proud of.

1016
01:14:14,881 --> 01:14:17,251
Everything in my life just...

1017
01:14:17,285 --> 01:14:21,187
just came too easy
and too quick.

1018
01:14:22,956 --> 01:14:24,924
Except for you.

1019
01:14:24,958 --> 01:14:28,229
The one thing that mattered.

1020
01:14:28,262 --> 01:14:30,897
For you, I had to wait.

1021
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:33,833
Until you were old?

1022
01:14:35,168 --> 01:14:37,103
Hey, lady, I'm not that old.

1023
01:14:41,875 --> 01:14:46,012
I love you much more
than enough.

1024
01:14:46,046 --> 01:14:48,815
I love you, Baba.

1025
01:15:46,307 --> 01:15:48,074
Ella!

1026
01:15:56,283 --> 01:15:58,051
Ella. Ella!

1027
01:15:58,084 --> 01:16:00,287
Baba!

1028
01:16:01,522 --> 01:16:03,189
Ella?

1029
01:16:05,526 --> 01:16:07,228
Ella.

1030
01:17:05,352 --> 01:17:07,020
Ella!

1031
01:17:20,166 --> 01:17:22,101
Ella!

1032
01:18:18,224 --> 01:18:19,593
Wow.

1033
01:18:19,627 --> 01:18:21,295
Seems bigger on the inside.

1034
01:18:21,328 --> 01:18:23,129
- Oh, my God.
- Way bigger.

1035
01:18:23,162 --> 01:18:24,632
Oh, I love it.

1036
01:18:24,665 --> 01:18:26,567
There's no service, though.

1037
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,335
- You hear that?
- Hey!

1038
01:18:28,369 --> 01:18:29,403
What?

1039
01:18:29,436 --> 01:18:31,472
- Hey!
- The quiet.

1040
01:18:31,505 --> 01:18:33,541
Baba!

1041
01:18:35,174 --> 01:18:36,410
Hello.

1042
01:18:36,443 --> 01:18:39,413
You're not going anywhere.

1043
01:18:43,584 --> 01:18:45,452
Hey, I'm back.

1044
01:18:46,687 --> 01:18:48,322
Hey.

1045
01:18:48,355 --> 01:18:49,657
Sorry that
happened to you, Baba.

1046
01:18:52,191 --> 01:18:54,395
Does everyone go to Heaven?

1047
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:59,165
That's what they say.

1048
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:01,402
Where are you?

1049
01:19:04,271 --> 01:19:07,308
Oh, my God, Ella,
you have to come up here.

1050
01:19:07,341 --> 01:19:09,075
Your bed is the size of...

1051
01:19:38,572 --> 01:19:40,206
Ella.

1052
01:19:42,576 --> 01:19:44,311
Ella.

1053
01:19:47,381 --> 01:19:48,749
Ella.

1054
01:19:48,782 --> 01:19:51,184
Where are you?

1055
01:20:01,462 --> 01:20:03,631
Susanna?

1056
01:20:03,664 --> 01:20:05,666
Susanna!

1057
01:20:11,672 --> 01:20:13,407
Wow.

1058
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,508
Seems bigger on the inside.

1059
01:20:14,541 --> 01:20:15,643
- Oh, my God.
- Way bigger.

1060
01:20:26,787 --> 01:20:29,222
Your name Stetler?

1061
01:20:29,256 --> 01:20:31,592
I got a lot of names.

1062
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:33,360
Where's Ella?

1063
01:20:33,394 --> 01:20:36,195
A lot of faces.

1064
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:38,399
And a lot of houses.

1065
01:20:38,432 --> 01:20:41,535
Been a room here for you
for a long time.

1066
01:20:41,568 --> 01:20:43,737
- Where is she?
- Where you belong.

1067
01:20:43,771 --> 01:20:46,273
With me.

1068
01:20:46,306 --> 01:20:47,408
Baba!

1069
01:20:47,441 --> 01:20:49,343
In here!

1070
01:20:49,376 --> 01:20:51,545
Baba, I'm scared! I'm here!

1071
01:20:51,578 --> 01:20:55,416
- Ella! Ella!
- Please find me. Please find me.

1072
01:20:55,449 --> 01:20:56,650
Ella. Ella.

1073
01:20:56,684 --> 01:20:59,218
It's hot in here!

1074
01:20:59,253 --> 01:21:00,788
Let her go.

1075
01:21:00,821 --> 01:21:02,489
Such a lucky daddy.

1076
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:05,325
She would do anything for you.

1077
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:07,561
Let her go, you son of a bitch.

1078
01:21:07,594 --> 01:21:09,663
She'd even stay.

1079
01:21:11,632 --> 01:21:13,567
Let her go. Let her go!

1080
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,702
Think of it.

1081
01:21:14,735 --> 01:21:17,438
Together forever.

1082
01:21:17,471 --> 01:21:19,707
Just you and her...

1083
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:21,775
and a lie.

1084
01:21:21,809 --> 01:21:23,477
She's innocent.

1085
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:25,012
Sure she is.

1086
01:21:25,045 --> 01:21:27,247
But she's with you.

1087
01:21:27,281 --> 01:21:28,649
I didn't do it!

1088
01:21:29,483 --> 01:21:31,018
I didn't do it!

1089
01:21:31,051 --> 01:21:33,454
Daddy, I don't know where I am!

1090
01:21:33,487 --> 01:21:35,489
Baba, please, please!

1091
01:21:36,423 --> 01:21:38,358
Let her go!

1092
01:21:47,534 --> 01:21:48,836
The sins of the fathers...

1093
01:21:48,869 --> 01:21:50,637
I didn't do it!

1094
01:21:54,341 --> 01:21:55,843
...come down on the kids.

1095
01:21:55,876 --> 01:21:58,345
But I... didn't...

1096
01:21:58,378 --> 01:21:59,546
do it!

1097
01:22:03,083 --> 01:22:06,453
That's the problem with mirrors.

1098
01:22:08,489 --> 01:22:11,391
They always show you yourself.

1099
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,869
Please.

1100
01:22:21,902 --> 01:22:24,071
Please let her go.
Please let her go.

1101
01:22:24,104 --> 01:22:25,506
Please, please, please, please.

1102
01:22:25,539 --> 01:22:27,641
Me?

1103
01:22:27,674 --> 01:22:30,544
The only one
keeping her here is you.

1104
01:22:35,582 --> 01:22:36,917
I can't do it.

1105
01:22:36,950 --> 01:22:38,819
I can't do this.

1106
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:41,522
I can't do this.

1107
01:22:41,555 --> 01:22:42,656
I can't do it anymore.

1108
01:22:42,689 --> 01:22:44,091
I can't.

1109
01:22:44,124 --> 01:22:46,593
I can't do this.
I-I can't do it.

1110
01:22:46,627 --> 01:22:48,529
I can't do this.

1111
01:22:52,566 --> 01:22:56,503
Then you know what
you've got to do, don't you?

1112
01:23:01,942 --> 01:23:03,610
Baba?

1113
01:23:05,412 --> 01:23:06,780
Oh... Ella.

1114
01:23:06,814 --> 01:23:08,482
Oh, honey.

1115
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:11,852
Oh, I am so sorry.

1116
01:23:11,885 --> 01:23:14,421
Ella, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1117
01:23:14,454 --> 01:23:16,323
What for?

1118
01:23:18,158 --> 01:23:20,127
For...

1119
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:22,629
not being what you think I am.

1120
01:23:22,663 --> 01:23:25,699
But... I love you
no matter what.

1121
01:23:25,732 --> 01:23:28,569
Don't you know that yet?

1122
01:23:37,945 --> 01:23:39,646
Is it time to go home?

1123
01:23:48,722 --> 01:23:50,824
It is, for you and Mommy.

1124
01:23:56,730 --> 01:23:58,432
Come on.

1125
01:24:18,919 --> 01:24:20,687
Hi, Mommy.

1126
01:25:05,966 --> 01:25:07,935
Where is her stuff?

1127
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:10,604
I'll send it. Later.

1128
01:25:13,707 --> 01:25:16,443
You're not coming with us?

1129
01:25:17,577 --> 01:25:19,813
It'll never let me.

1130
01:25:19,846 --> 01:25:21,748
I'd end up right back here.

1131
01:25:21,782 --> 01:25:24,252
And if you were with me,
you would, too.

1132
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:26,019
I belong here.

1133
01:25:26,053 --> 01:25:29,723
Can we just try
and work through it?

1134
01:25:31,124 --> 01:25:32,826
I love you.

1135
01:25:32,859 --> 01:25:34,861
I love you so much.

1136
01:25:36,596 --> 01:25:38,565
But...

1137
01:25:38,598 --> 01:25:40,567
I always knew that
you were only borrowed.

1138
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,470
Stop talking crazy.

1139
01:25:44,638 --> 01:25:46,707
Just get in the car,

1140
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:49,076
and we can talk about it.

1141
01:25:49,109 --> 01:25:51,578
I killed her, Suse.

1142
01:25:58,151 --> 01:26:00,487
I let her drown.

1143
01:26:04,024 --> 01:26:06,093
<i>I could've pulled her out,</i>

1144
01:26:06,126 --> 01:26:07,995
and I didn't.

1145
01:26:11,031 --> 01:26:12,766
I watched her die.

1146
01:26:15,035 --> 01:26:18,772
<i>All those years being so angry,</i>

1147
01:26:18,805 --> 01:26:22,642
<i>hating her so much, and...</i>

1148
01:26:22,676 --> 01:26:24,678
keeping it inside.

1149
01:26:26,013 --> 01:26:28,515
I should've left...

1150
01:26:29,182 --> 01:26:31,618
...years before.

1151
01:26:32,786 --> 01:26:34,621
But I didn't.

1152
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:42,029
I belong...

1153
01:26:42,062 --> 01:26:43,830
right here.

1154
01:26:49,036 --> 01:26:51,705
Can't run away from your shadow.

1155
01:26:57,077 --> 01:27:00,747
There's
somebody inside the house.

1156
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:08,055
Baba, what's happening?

1157
01:27:08,088 --> 01:27:09,856
Let's go.

1158
01:27:19,833 --> 01:27:23,003
<i>People have always
stayed in that house.</i>

1159
01:27:23,036 --> 01:27:26,073
<i>Some don't leave.</i>

1160
01:27:26,106 --> 01:27:29,743
<i>The right ones
usually find the place.</i>

1161
01:27:29,776 --> 01:27:31,745
<i>Or maybe it's
the other way around.</i>

1162
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:36,049
<i>The place finds them.</i>

1163
01:27:54,042 --> 01:27:55,830

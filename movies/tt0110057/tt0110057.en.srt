1
00:01:50,893 --> 00:01:54,852
And welcome to
the 38th annual NBA All-Star game...

2
00:01:54,963 --> 00:01:56,692
from Chicago Stadium.

3
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,699
A standing-room-only crowd.

4
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:03,238
A steal by Jordan.
He spun it away from the Mailman.

5
00:02:16,918 --> 00:02:19,386
Just needs a little time-out to reorganize.

6
00:02:19,487 --> 00:02:22,456
And the chances
of a West comeback are slipping away.

7
00:02:24,425 --> 00:02:26,450
Aguirre for three.

8
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:28,927
I have never seen an All-Star game...

9
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,624
that had such spectacular passing...

10
00:02:31,732 --> 00:02:33,893
and plays,
and thundering plays like this.

11
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:36,401
They're beginning to hang, Billy.

12
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:39,939
Ah, what a way to end this ball game.

13
00:02:54,988 --> 00:02:58,389
Right now, I wanna, you know,
play in the NBA...

14
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:01,585
like anybody else would wanna be.

15
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:04,893
That's who -
That's something...

16
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:07,660
I dream and think
about all the time -

17
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:09,666
playing in the NBA.

18
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:17,940
He's just doing something
that he loves so much.

19
00:03:18,978 --> 00:03:22,709
He just love it so much.
I'm just happy for him.

20
00:03:22,815 --> 00:03:24,715
If somebody can understand
the way William play...

21
00:03:24,817 --> 00:03:27,377
that'll make me feel
a lot better.

22
00:03:27,486 --> 00:03:30,421
The way they should have
understood the way I played.

23
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:42,359
This Chicagoan
is making his seventh All-Star appearance.

24
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:44,992
From the Detroit Pistons, 6'1 "...

25
00:03:45,103 --> 00:03:47,731
Isaiah Thomas!

26
00:03:50,241 --> 00:03:52,232
When I get in the NBA...

27
00:03:52,343 --> 00:03:55,278
the first thing I'm gonna do...

28
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,009
I'm gonna see my mama, buy her a house...

29
00:03:59,117 --> 00:04:02,553
I'm gonna go there and make sure
my sister and my brother's okay.

30
00:04:02,654 --> 00:04:04,986
If we were okay or not.

31
00:04:05,089 --> 00:04:07,716
Probably get my dad...

32
00:04:07,824 --> 00:04:09,815
a Cadillac Oldsmobile...

33
00:04:09,927 --> 00:04:11,895
so he can cruise in the games.

34
00:04:11,995 --> 00:04:13,690
Something real long.

35
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:15,856
Dominique.! Ooh.!

36
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:19,936
He dreams about it.

37
00:04:20,037 --> 00:04:22,301
He look at those
basketball commercials...

38
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:25,204
where they be advertising these Nike shoes?

39
00:04:25,309 --> 00:04:27,368
He'll tell his little, small brother...

40
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:29,377
"Joe, Joe, that's me."

41
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:33,813
So the West leads.
Thomas trying to go the distance. Loses it.

42
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:47,221
I don't even think about
it, if he don't make it.

43
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,628
Just 'cause I'm so -

44
00:04:49,732 --> 00:04:51,825
I'm so, you know,
focused in on him making it.

45
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:53,834
I just know he'll make it.

46
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:35,100
I'm off to Central...

47
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,177
and the Congress
Expressway-

48
00:05:37,277 --> 00:05:41,236
a park over there where there are
some pretty talented young men.

49
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:45,682
Earl Smith works downtown
as an insurance executive.

50
00:05:45,786 --> 00:05:49,882
On weekends he's an unofficial talent scout
for several area high schools.

51
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:57,757
This is what you call
"beating the bushes."

52
00:05:57,865 --> 00:06:00,766
This is the job
of most of your freshmen coaches...

53
00:06:00,868 --> 00:06:04,963
and guys like me who -
who played a little bit of the game...

54
00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:08,563
who love trying to help young people
on the road to success.

55
00:06:10,643 --> 00:06:12,543
It's in! It's in!

56
00:06:14,347 --> 00:06:18,215
Today Earl spots Arthur Agee,
who just graduated from grammar school.

57
00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:22,880
He's got the quickest first step
that I've seen in about five years.

58
00:06:22,989 --> 00:06:24,889
His first step.

59
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:32,457
I will bet you a steak dinner
in four years you'll be hearing from him.

60
00:06:32,564 --> 00:06:34,998
I don't even know anything about him.

61
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:51,729
Several days later,

62
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,578
Earl takes Arthur and his family
on a recruiting visit...

63
00:06:53,685 --> 00:06:57,121
to the high school
where NBA star Isiah Thomas played.

64
00:06:57,222 --> 00:06:59,247
The visit will give
St. Joseph's coaches...

65
00:06:59,357 --> 00:07:01,347
a chance to see Arthur perform.

66
00:07:10,301 --> 00:07:12,826
Your role today, Arthur...

67
00:07:12,937 --> 00:07:15,929
is to impress the coaches.

68
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,065
Try not to be too fancy.

69
00:07:18,175 --> 00:07:20,643
Take the open shot when you have it.

70
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:24,648
Play good defense
and make good passes.

71
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:27,308
The rest of it,
just play natural, you know.

72
00:07:28,953 --> 00:07:32,820
I'm hoping I'm gonna go to St. Joe
and play...

73
00:07:32,922 --> 00:07:37,086
but first I gotta -
I gotta get my books straight.

74
00:07:37,193 --> 00:07:39,684
And...

75
00:07:39,796 --> 00:07:43,254
hopefully come out
and impress the coaches.

76
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:47,701
Is it kinda scary?

77
00:07:47,804 --> 00:07:49,772
Yes, it is.

78
00:07:52,675 --> 00:07:56,304
I've never been to a school
way out before...

79
00:07:56,412 --> 00:08:00,643
and I would be going to a school
with different kids, different races.

80
00:08:02,518 --> 00:08:06,648
You can look at the scenery,
new friends to meet.

81
00:08:10,025 --> 00:08:12,255
What if Isiah's there today?

82
00:08:15,297 --> 00:08:18,095
Well, if he be there...

83
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:21,328
I'll be shocked...

84
00:08:21,436 --> 00:08:23,961
'cause that'd be my first time
ever seeing him...

85
00:08:24,072 --> 00:08:26,768
Up close, you know, real life.

86
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:36,547
Basketball has to be second
to your academics.

87
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:38,710
If you don't get your grades,
you're not gonna play.

88
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:43,347
If you work hard at the grades,
and if you work hard at basketball...

89
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:46,255
then I would be able to help you
as far as going to college.

90
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,328
And I guarantee this.

91
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:51,830
I can't promise you where you're gonna go
and if you're gonna be a star...

92
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:55,926
but I guarantee that I would help you
get into the school...

93
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:58,527
that would be best for you.

94
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,936
I'm making a commitment to you...

95
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,067
if you make a commitment
to being part of this kind of a program.

96
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:13,444
Out of all of the kids
at the St. Joseph Basketball Camp...

97
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,579
there are a few like Arthur
that Coach Pingatore is recruiting.

98
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:23,724
It was like million of guys
trying to be better than the other...

99
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,321
but, to me,
I was better than all of them...

100
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,901
except Isiah.

101
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:34,496
It gives me great pleasure to introduce
to you a graduate of St. Joe's...

102
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,167
high school all-American...

103
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,768
All-American from Indiana University...

104
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,109
five-time NBA All-Star...

105
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,410
Isiah Thomas.

106
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:49,351
Hello. How are you?

107
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:53,653
In everybody's neighborhood,
there's a guy who can really play.

108
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,658
He can shoot the lights out.

109
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,355
Every time down the court -
Swish, swish, swish!

110
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:02,627
Then he goes to St. Joseph high School...

111
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:05,760
and the guy gets cut.

112
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:09,931
You say, "But Tom was real good.
Why did he get cut?'"

113
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:13,738
See, Tom didn't learn
the fundamentals of team basketball...

114
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:16,313
which is what you're learning
how to play.

115
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:33,796
He told my daddy
that he knew I could play...

116
00:10:33,897 --> 00:10:35,831
so he just had to play me hard.

117
00:10:51,882 --> 00:10:55,715
I can see the playground in him.
I can see talent.

118
00:10:55,818 --> 00:10:58,116
But I don't see the confidence.

119
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:06,184
With Isiah, I just knew
he was gonna be a great one.

120
00:11:06,295 --> 00:11:11,198
He had that total combination
of personality, confidence, talent...

121
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,359
intelligence.

122
00:11:13,469 --> 00:11:17,735
I think I see it in one kid
that's coming here.

123
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,208
He flows with a smoothness
and confidence...

124
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,210
and strength...

125
00:11:24,312 --> 00:11:26,837
that you don't see in every kid.

126
00:11:26,948 --> 00:11:30,008
But he could become a great player.

127
00:11:39,994 --> 00:11:43,521
You gotta take a shot.
Always work it. You can't block it.

128
00:11:48,603 --> 00:11:50,730
Ohh.!

129
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:52,965
I just bang him and bruise him.

130
00:11:53,073 --> 00:11:56,338
I'm trying to let him know right now
you gonna get hit, get knocked down...

131
00:11:56,443 --> 00:11:59,412
you gonna get banged around,
so you better get used to it now.

132
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:02,549
Stop it. One-hand hook.

133
00:12:04,318 --> 00:12:07,913
All these basketball dreams I had,
they gone.

134
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:11,286
All I see -All my dreams in him now.

135
00:12:11,392 --> 00:12:14,122
I want him to make it so bad,
I don't know what to do.

136
00:12:16,196 --> 00:12:19,654
They want to play basketball
and stuff, that was always okay.

137
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:24,630
But I was gonna make sure all of 'em
got through high school.

138
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:28,730
A high school diploma
was very important to me.

139
00:12:32,712 --> 00:12:36,842
My mother,
she was like mother and father to me.

140
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:41,648
She don't want me really
hanging around over here that much...

141
00:12:41,754 --> 00:12:43,722
'cause of the gangs.

142
00:12:44,957 --> 00:12:47,255
I feel if I go to St. Joseph...

143
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,453
I'll at least get a good chance
to go to a good college.

144
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,894
That would be good for me.

145
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:04,632
That was my first son.

146
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:09,180
I said, "That's Daddy's man, '"
so we just started calling him "Man. '"

147
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:11,249
Get around it!

148
00:13:12,784 --> 00:13:14,945
I could have been a good college player.

149
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:18,681
Most likely
I would have made it to the pros.

150
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:21,622
But, you know, once I had my son...

151
00:13:21,725 --> 00:13:24,353
I knew then something good
was gonna come out of it.

152
00:13:24,462 --> 00:13:26,726
I think the talent gonna be passed on.

153
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:37,540
He told me, "I'm so scared of growing up."
I said, "Why?"

154
00:13:37,641 --> 00:13:41,668
he said a grown-up has so many problems.
"I got so many things on my mind."

155
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,441
I just want Arthur to have more...

156
00:13:44,548 --> 00:13:46,914
you know,
have a better life than what I had.

157
00:13:47,017 --> 00:13:50,315
I don't want him experiencing
bad things that I went through in life.

158
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:34,156
Austin Boulevard
will be the next stop. Austin is next.

159
00:14:34,263 --> 00:14:36,322
Like Isiah Thomas before them...

160
00:14:36,431 --> 00:14:39,559
both Arthur and William make
a three-hour round trip each day...

161
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:42,569
between the city and St. Joseph's.

162
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:45,468
That was strange for me
going out to a far-out school.

163
00:14:45,573 --> 00:14:50,203
I saw a rug, flowers, clean hallways...

164
00:14:50,311 --> 00:14:53,439
things that I didn't see
in an ordinary school.

165
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,496
Gotta move! Gotta move!

166
00:15:20,607 --> 00:15:22,507
Come on.

167
00:15:24,945 --> 00:15:26,845
- Three, four, five or 10?
- Ten.

168
00:15:26,947 --> 00:15:28,881
You got it. Three, four, five?

169
00:15:28,982 --> 00:15:32,645
Arthur wins the starting
point-guard position on the freshmen team.

170
00:15:32,752 --> 00:15:37,280
Agee, I want you to find
in that warm-up number two.

171
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,620
Brown, number three.

172
00:15:39,726 --> 00:15:42,217
Ettmeyer, four.

173
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:46,128
Hey, Arthur, you know
if you miss free throws...

174
00:15:46,231 --> 00:15:48,699
they count 'em up,
and you have to pay 15 cents.

175
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:50,598
Then if you don't pay
it, they gonna make you

176
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:52,396
run 50 laps, and still
you have to pay the money.

177
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:55,473
- You still gotta pay the money?
- That's way out.

178
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:04,012
When Arthur first started at St.
Joseph's...

179
00:16:04,116 --> 00:16:06,482
he was a good kid,
from what we saw...

180
00:16:06,585 --> 00:16:08,883
but he was very immature.

181
00:16:08,988 --> 00:16:11,548
He might have been a little more
disruptive, speaking out...

182
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:13,749
getting into childish things.

183
00:16:15,827 --> 00:16:18,694
He wasn't used to the discipline
and the control.

184
00:16:18,796 --> 00:16:22,232
He reverted back to, maybe,
his environment, where he came from.

185
00:16:24,802 --> 00:16:28,704
I just never been around
a lot of white people and...

186
00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:33,106
it was different, because at a black school
I could associate with the people.

187
00:16:33,211 --> 00:16:35,145
They talk the way I talk.

188
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:38,977
It was a little hard,
but I can adjust to it.

189
00:16:40,485 --> 00:16:43,510
You can see there was talent there.

190
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,350
We kept saying up in the stands,
"Get the ball to Arthur...

191
00:16:46,456 --> 00:16:48,754
because he's going to do it for you. '"

192
00:16:48,859 --> 00:16:51,521
And sure enough, they gave him the ball
with seconds on the clock.

193
00:16:59,803 --> 00:17:03,136
I noticed a change immediately
after he started going out there.

194
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,506
To see your child mature, you say,
"Oh, maybe this is good for him."

195
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,351
William begins
his freshman season on St. Joe's varsity...

196
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,451
the top-ranked squad in the state.

197
00:17:35,738 --> 00:17:38,263
He's already received several letters...

198
00:17:38,374 --> 00:17:40,773
from Division I schools -

199
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:44,470
Marquette and Rice and Creighton,
Illinois State...

200
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:46,479
to name a few.

201
00:17:50,051 --> 00:17:53,077
Beat him! Beat him! Beat him!
Keep back!

202
00:17:56,725 --> 00:18:00,684
Hold it up! hold it up!
You're killing us!

203
00:18:00,795 --> 00:18:03,263
Why did he get to the ball before you?

204
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:08,426
He asks me, do I wanna be
a great player? And I keep saying yeah.

205
00:18:08,535 --> 00:18:11,504
He said, "For four years,
I'm gonna be on you every day."

206
00:18:11,605 --> 00:18:14,597
So he said, "You might as well
get used to it now."

207
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,939
hard left. No, no. Go hard left.

208
00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:22,004
Right, I know you can do it.
Left, you can't. All right? Go hard.

209
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,278
Not bad. Do it again.

210
00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:34,320
If you look at Matthew,
and again he's saying...

211
00:18:34,428 --> 00:18:37,624
at the time the kingdom of heaven
will be like this.

212
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:40,563
This is how Matthew's gonna use Jesus.
This is how he's gonna start it out.

213
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:44,102
What this is saying
is you have to take the faith-

214
00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:47,536
When I first came out here,
it was, like, "I wanna go home.

215
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,609
Is this really the right school for me?'"

216
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,612
But every little thing you do
that go against their rule...

217
00:18:54,714 --> 00:18:56,705
you have detention.

218
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:59,717
And they'll suspend you quick
at the school too.

219
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:01,719
They'll suspend you quick.

220
00:19:01,821 --> 00:19:04,619
The kids that are willing to do it...

221
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:07,554
are gonna take something away

222
00:19:07,555 --> 00:19:09,352
that will help them for
the rest of their life.

223
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:12,225
The kids that are not willing to do it...

224
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,457
for whatever reason, uh...

225
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:16,796
are not gonna be very successful
as far as here.

226
00:19:16,902 --> 00:19:20,770
The civil rights movement
started up in the '50s.

227
00:19:20,872 --> 00:19:23,070
When William first entered St. Joe's...

228
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:26,403
tests revealed he was working
on a fourth or fifth-grade level.

229
00:19:27,813 --> 00:19:30,373
I could see that he had the potential...

230
00:19:30,482 --> 00:19:34,077
but because he was shy, it seemed as though
no one was trying to reach him.

231
00:19:35,786 --> 00:19:39,688
Sister Marilyn told me,
"You have to be one good ballplayer...

232
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,281
to get in this school with these grades. '"

233
00:19:42,393 --> 00:19:45,055
- What war beginning in the '60s?
- Vietnam.

234
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:49,292
At the end of the year,
he had gone four grades above...

235
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,699
just in the way he listened and learned.

236
00:19:55,973 --> 00:19:57,873
Back in grammar school...

237
00:19:57,975 --> 00:20:01,035
academics really didn't matter
too much to me at all.

238
00:20:03,113 --> 00:20:07,481
It was playing ball for the team-
really, we was the standouts in the school.

239
00:20:07,584 --> 00:20:10,644
If you showed up in class,
that was good enough for them.

240
00:20:10,753 --> 00:20:13,745
I was just going to school for the girls.

241
00:20:13,857 --> 00:20:15,825
Trip out with your friends...

242
00:20:15,925 --> 00:20:19,053
get out, go play some more basketball.

243
00:20:19,162 --> 00:20:21,756
That was basically it.

244
00:20:25,401 --> 00:20:29,770
Arthur also entered St. Joe's
on a fourth or fifth-grade level.

245
00:20:29,873 --> 00:20:33,706
Nobody in their right mind
is crazy about school.

246
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:35,743
If the president brought
up a thing right now

247
00:20:35,744 --> 00:20:37,677
that say, "Close all schools"...

248
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:41,215
do you think any kids would be trying
to go out there, stand on a picket line...

249
00:20:41,316 --> 00:20:45,275
and wave and get billboards...

250
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:47,685
saying, "Reopen schools"?

251
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:50,451
Nice and tall, guys.
Now, don't look at the flash.

252
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,460
Arthur was in
the lower group of the general program.

253
00:20:53,562 --> 00:20:55,689
Okay, fellas. Good.

254
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:58,823
At the end of the year,
he was still in the lower group.

255
00:20:58,934 --> 00:21:00,902
One, two, three.!

256
00:21:04,071 --> 00:21:06,938
For Arthur, the season is over.

257
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:10,204
His freshman team finished second
in the conference.

258
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:13,838
William's varsity is rolling
through the play-offs.

259
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,892
Against Proviso East,
William plays his best game yet.

260
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:36,429
And the Chargers move a step closer to
going downstate to compete for the title.

261
00:21:41,207 --> 00:21:44,973
St. Joe's made it downstate
five of the last six years.

262
00:21:45,078 --> 00:21:48,172
The one thing we haven't done
is win a state tournament.

263
00:21:49,582 --> 00:21:54,485
Man, that'd be a big thing
if I could go downstate as a freshman.

264
00:21:54,587 --> 00:21:57,351
Isiah was good enough
to start on the varsity as a freshman.

265
00:21:57,457 --> 00:22:01,756
I didn't do it because I was worried
about bringing him along too rapidly.

266
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,023
I think by not doing it,
it cost us a state championship.

267
00:22:09,902 --> 00:22:14,532
In the sectional finals,
Fenwick challenges St. Joe's title hopes.

268
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,599
But in the second quarter,
William steps up.

269
00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:21,779
With his brother Curtis looking on...

270
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,839
William scores 16 points to lead
the Chargers to the sectional title.

271
00:22:28,687 --> 00:22:33,385
From Chicago, it's The
Sports Writers On TV.

272
00:22:33,491 --> 00:22:37,928
I think I may have seen
the next Isiah Thomas.

273
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:42,591
St. Joe of Westchester
has a kid named William Gates...

274
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,134
who is starting as a freshman.

275
00:22:45,236 --> 00:22:47,704
Remember, you heard it first
from Bill Gleason.

276
00:22:47,805 --> 00:22:50,740
Put it in your memory banks,
ladies and gentlemen.

277
00:22:50,842 --> 00:22:53,436
William Gates.

278
00:22:56,814 --> 00:23:00,476
In the supersectionals,
St. Joe's meets DeSalles...

279
00:23:00,584 --> 00:23:03,815
to decide who will go downstate.

280
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,036
William plays more like
an intimidated freshman

281
00:23:06,037 --> 00:23:08,152
than a freshman sensation.

282
00:23:10,394 --> 00:23:14,592
Six-nine senior all-American
Eric Anderson dominates St. Joe's.

283
00:23:18,402 --> 00:23:21,997
But in the third quarter,
William takes over again.

284
00:23:23,106 --> 00:23:26,837
He fires over Anderson
and is fouled.

285
00:23:29,378 --> 00:23:31,778
William's 13 points
in the second half...

286
00:23:31,881 --> 00:23:34,179
pull the Chargers to within four.

287
00:23:37,853 --> 00:23:41,380
With less than two minutes to play,
it's a must-score.

288
00:23:52,368 --> 00:23:54,632
St. Joe's jump shot falls short.

289
00:24:00,008 --> 00:24:02,442
Eric Anderson.!

290
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:20,789
Despite the loss,
William's gutty performance...

291
00:24:20,895 --> 00:24:22,795
bodes well for next year.

292
00:24:22,897 --> 00:24:24,160
There will be an announcement

293
00:24:24,161 --> 00:24:26,093
on ticket sales immediately
following the game.

294
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,768
Rewriting 7,300 times 10...

295
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:36,536
to the negative fifth
in scientific notation.

296
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:38,702
Who wants that problem?

297
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:40,712
- I do.
- Go ahead, William.

298
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:42,748
- 7.3...
- 7.3...

299
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:46,081
- times 10 to the third.
- Times 10 to the third times-

300
00:24:46,186 --> 00:24:48,381
- 10 to the negative second.
- Is that good!

301
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:50,389
Very good.

302
00:24:50,491 --> 00:24:53,426
When I went out there,
I was very intimidated...

303
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:56,461
'cause I just knew that everybody out there
was just smarter than me.

304
00:24:57,497 --> 00:25:00,227
As the year went on...

305
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,631
and I was making
an "A'"and "B'"honor roll...

306
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:05,932
I just felt like,
"hey, I'm just as good as them. '"

307
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,638
Now what you have to identify-

308
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:13,473
Both William and Arthur
have partial scholarships from St. Joe's.

309
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:16,070
The rest of William's tuition
is paid for by Cycle...

310
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,082
a Cabrini Green organization.

311
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:21,210
But Cycle can't cover
this year's tuition increase.

312
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,811
I was called on
by Brother Edwin Duprais.

313
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:27,050
He was trying to raise money
to help kids...

314
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:29,855
that couldn't otherwise go
to those kind of schools.

315
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:32,156
It really touched a soft
spot in my heart...

316
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:36,166
and so I decided that my husband and I
would participate on a personal basis.

317
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:39,533
William was selected as the kid...

318
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,505
that was able to go to school,
based on our contribution.

319
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,632
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

320
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:49,043
You played a great game. I want you to
meet our friends Liz Duncan, Tom Paris.

321
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:51,047
- Nice game.
- William Gates.

322
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,378
With continuing support
from Patricia Wier...

323
00:25:53,484 --> 00:25:56,942
William is assured
that his entire education at St. Joe's...

324
00:25:57,054 --> 00:25:59,284
will be free.

325
00:26:03,661 --> 00:26:06,789
Arthur's family is paying
for half of his tuition...

326
00:26:06,897 --> 00:26:10,355
and the increase comes
at an especially bad time.

327
00:26:10,467 --> 00:26:12,992
Worked for Sara Lee, got laid off.

328
00:26:13,103 --> 00:26:17,369
Uh, worked for Scala's Meat Packing.
Got laid off there. You know.

329
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:21,068
You look around your house,
you see your food getting low. Okay?

330
00:26:21,177 --> 00:26:26,137
And you got your bills due here,
your bills due there.

331
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:32,487
I got called down to the office.

332
00:26:32,589 --> 00:26:34,682
Brother Leo wanted to talk to me.

333
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:38,454
He was telling me about how much,
certain money my mama had to pay...

334
00:26:38,561 --> 00:26:40,620
for me to stay in school.

335
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:44,188
They say if she don't have it by this time,
you gotta stay out till she pay it.

336
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,292
I was staying out, like,
two and three weeks and stuff.

337
00:26:47,403 --> 00:26:49,927
By the end of the freshman year...

338
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:54,338
whatever balance there was for
tuition was never taken care of.

339
00:26:54,443 --> 00:26:56,877
Consequently,
going into the sophomore year...

340
00:26:56,979 --> 00:26:59,243
we had the balance
plus the new tuition...

341
00:26:59,348 --> 00:27:02,078
so that it was going to continue
to become a problem.

342
00:27:02,184 --> 00:27:05,585
Whatever scout that they have come out
to these different neighborhoods...

343
00:27:05,687 --> 00:27:08,155
and scout out
these little basketball players...

344
00:27:08,257 --> 00:27:11,693
and get 'em to come to their school
and offer them these scholarships.

345
00:27:11,793 --> 00:27:14,261
Then once they get out there,
the story is totally different.

346
00:27:14,263 --> 00:27:16,019
I was under the impression
that Arthur would

347
00:27:16,032 --> 00:27:17,799
have help as far as
getting to school.

348
00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:20,833
Arthur would have help
in getting his books.

349
00:27:20,935 --> 00:27:23,096
But, see, none of that occur.

350
00:27:23,204 --> 00:27:27,971
Finally, with the Agees
owing $ 1,500 in back payments...

351
00:27:28,075 --> 00:27:31,010
St. Joseph's forced Arthur
to leave the school.

352
00:27:33,014 --> 00:27:36,347
I thought Pingatore and them
would help me out, but -

353
00:27:41,322 --> 00:27:44,052
You have to draw the line
because, as I said...

354
00:27:44,158 --> 00:27:48,116
tuition is something that,
as a school, we depend on...

355
00:27:48,228 --> 00:27:50,458
for 90%% of our revenue.

356
00:27:50,563 --> 00:27:53,589
I guess he thought I wasn't gonna be
that big of a ballplayer.

357
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,136
So why would he just waste
some money on me staying there?

358
00:27:57,237 --> 00:27:59,205
Or, you know, he thought
I wasn't gonna grow.

359
00:27:59,306 --> 00:28:02,867
He kept on saying,
"When are you gonna grow?"

360
00:28:02,976 --> 00:28:04,944
Well, I don't know.

361
00:28:06,646 --> 00:28:10,104
If I had known that all of this
was gonna lead to this...

362
00:28:10,216 --> 00:28:12,946
Arthur would have never went
to St. Joseph's.

363
00:28:13,053 --> 00:28:16,022
I mean, if I had known that he was gonna
have to go through this type of pain...

364
00:28:16,122 --> 00:28:18,021
and myself-the anguish of it...

365
00:28:18,123 --> 00:28:21,752
and then to put him out
in the middle of a school year-

366
00:28:51,622 --> 00:28:54,113
I.D.'s, ladies and gentlemen.

367
00:28:55,827 --> 00:28:57,727
All right. Okay, okay. All right.

368
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:02,090
Can't take no beepers in here.

369
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,725
Give me my beeper, man.

370
00:29:06,104 --> 00:29:07,901
Mr. Wade, I need to see you
at the front door.

371
00:29:08,005 --> 00:29:11,600
Now where you gonna go?
Your friend go to jail. No beepers in here.

372
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:13,609
Don't make no scene.

373
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:16,838
Arthur is accepted
at the public high school near his home.

374
00:29:16,947 --> 00:29:21,646
He's been out of school for two months
and lost a whole semester's credit.

375
00:29:23,487 --> 00:29:25,381
Here you have a youngster caught

376
00:29:25,382 --> 00:29:27,924
in the middle of two
separate school systems.

377
00:29:28,024 --> 00:29:30,322
Had he stayed at St. Joseph's...

378
00:29:30,427 --> 00:29:33,692
he would have been able to receive
credit for that first semester.

379
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:37,699
Doesn't seem fair,
but then that's the system.

380
00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:40,939
If he was going out there
and he was playing

381
00:29:40,952 --> 00:29:42,532
like they had predicted
him to play...

382
00:29:42,639 --> 00:29:44,538
he wouldn't be at Marshall.

383
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,370
Economics wouldn't have had anything
to do with him not being at St. Joe's.

384
00:29:47,476 --> 00:29:48,846
Somebody would have made some kind of

385
00:29:48,847 --> 00:29:50,809
arrangement, and the kid
would've still been there.

386
00:29:50,913 --> 00:29:54,178
He's not making it like they thought he was
gonna make it on the basketball court...

387
00:29:54,283 --> 00:29:56,217
so he's not there, simple as that.

388
00:29:56,318 --> 00:29:59,082
It doesn't take no brilliant person
to figure that out.

389
00:30:03,459 --> 00:30:07,361
It's mid-season
when Arthur joins the sophomore team.

390
00:30:07,463 --> 00:30:10,864
He was so depressed and devastated,
he just closed himself off in the room.

391
00:30:10,966 --> 00:30:16,369
I would go in there and tell him
every day, "hey, things will look up. '"

392
00:30:18,573 --> 00:30:21,167
Coming off the bench,
Arthur wears number 11...

393
00:30:21,276 --> 00:30:23,403
Isiah Thomas's number.

394
00:30:35,256 --> 00:30:37,724
What kind of techniques were being used...

395
00:30:37,826 --> 00:30:40,852
to take away the freedoms
that had been earned?

396
00:30:40,962 --> 00:30:43,259
- Jeannetta.
- Poll tax.

397
00:30:43,363 --> 00:30:46,560
Poll tax. Okay, Arthur,
what other techniques were used...

398
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:49,295
to keep black Americans from voting?

399
00:30:49,403 --> 00:30:51,303
Um-

400
00:30:51,405 --> 00:30:53,703
You could almost forget
about his being there.

401
00:30:53,807 --> 00:30:56,367
That's how quiet he really was.

402
00:30:56,477 --> 00:30:59,935
I think the transition
had something to do with it.

403
00:31:03,784 --> 00:31:06,252
In comparing
Marshall high School to St. Joseph...

404
00:31:06,353 --> 00:31:08,287
I don't think
that there is any comparison.

405
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:10,856
People can afford
to send their children there.

406
00:31:10,957 --> 00:31:14,256
They can afford to put money
into the school.

407
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,294
Once they walk in those doors...

408
00:31:16,395 --> 00:31:19,592
they walk in there to get that diploma
and to go on to college.

409
00:31:19,699 --> 00:31:23,795
Whereas our students,
if they get out of high school...

410
00:31:23,903 --> 00:31:26,667
a lot of them,
it's an accomplishment.

411
00:31:26,772 --> 00:31:30,367
Trinomial. What's this gonna be?
Both of these are what?

412
00:31:30,476 --> 00:31:33,411
If he wanna go back next year...

413
00:31:33,513 --> 00:31:35,811
he gonna go back, if I have to beg.

414
00:31:38,417 --> 00:31:41,874
Because, uh, I wanna help him
with his little dream.

415
00:31:47,659 --> 00:31:51,095
Arthur's mother, Sheila,
has lost her minimum-wage job...

416
00:31:51,196 --> 00:31:53,096
as a nurse's assistant...

417
00:31:53,198 --> 00:31:55,462
because of chronic back pain.

418
00:31:58,904 --> 00:32:01,930
It's just a real hard area
to live in, period.

419
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,508
And as far as raising kids -

420
00:32:05,911 --> 00:32:08,675
kids don't even have a playground
or play area...

421
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,680
anything constructive to do
in the neighborhood.

422
00:32:11,782 --> 00:32:14,910
But you see why half of them
become gangbangers, you know.

423
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:18,079
Because it's nothing constructive
in the neighborhood for 'em.

424
00:32:22,226 --> 00:32:26,219
So now it's, like, you more or less
got to keep your kids close to you...

425
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,491
and watch 'em at all times.

426
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:51,782
In June, after 20 years of marriage...

427
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:54,516
Arthur's dad leaves the family.

428
00:33:11,673 --> 00:33:15,973
Big logjam into the lane.
Jordan's 15-footer good from out front.

429
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:19,241
Make sure you look at
how many shots have been taken.

430
00:33:19,348 --> 00:33:23,307
Jordan might shoot, uh, 15 out of 40.

431
00:33:24,386 --> 00:33:26,286
Fifteen out of 40?

432
00:33:26,388 --> 00:33:28,652
I'm just saying, for instance.
He's done it.

433
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:32,557
But see, if you do that,
you're gonna know about it.

434
00:33:32,661 --> 00:33:34,561
Ooh.

435
00:33:34,663 --> 00:33:37,096
Curtis tells William,
"The most important thing...

436
00:33:37,198 --> 00:33:39,291
is getting the ball in the basket. '"

437
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,130
Curtis said the boy's good.

438
00:33:42,236 --> 00:33:44,966
He say he's real good, but he don't listen.

439
00:33:45,072 --> 00:33:48,041
He said if he listen to him,
he'd be better.

440
00:33:49,276 --> 00:33:53,212
He's always telling me,
you should do this and you should do that.

441
00:33:53,314 --> 00:33:56,181
Seems like everybody I know
is my coach.

442
00:33:58,219 --> 00:34:01,211
I know a whole lot about basketball.

443
00:34:01,322 --> 00:34:03,449
Now it's Isiah Thomas.

444
00:34:03,557 --> 00:34:07,515
I guess, in so many words,
I'm a pro at that in my mind.

445
00:34:09,462 --> 00:34:13,057
The Trojans were led on the
court all season by 6'2'"sophomore guard...

446
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:15,066
Curtis Gates.

447
00:34:25,812 --> 00:34:30,181
When he went to college,
and Michael Jordan first came to the NBA...

448
00:34:30,283 --> 00:34:34,878
they would, you know, sit around and argue
over him-who could play the best.

449
00:34:37,656 --> 00:34:42,059
Curtis was named Player
of the Decade at Colby Junior College...

450
00:34:42,161 --> 00:34:45,824
but he also developed a reputation
for being uncoachable.

451
00:34:46,865 --> 00:34:51,529
Curtis's idea of being real good is...

452
00:34:51,637 --> 00:34:55,664
you don't follow the rules,
you do what you wanna do.

453
00:34:55,774 --> 00:35:00,040
Curtis finally signed
at the University of Central Florida...

454
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:03,773
but he didn't get along with the coach
and rarely played.

455
00:35:03,881 --> 00:35:06,406
Even if he didn't play ball...

456
00:35:06,517 --> 00:35:08,117
it was a nice university.

457
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:10,646
He could have finished school.

458
00:35:10,755 --> 00:35:12,655
But he couldn't handle it.

459
00:35:23,034 --> 00:35:25,161
Security. Can I help you?

460
00:35:25,269 --> 00:35:28,238
I'm used to everybody
in the neighborhood loving me...

461
00:35:28,339 --> 00:35:30,637
and knowing how good I can play.

462
00:35:31,743 --> 00:35:33,158
It just seemed like people looked up

463
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:35,007
to Curtis Gates when
it came to basketball...

464
00:35:35,112 --> 00:35:37,205
but now...

465
00:35:37,314 --> 00:35:39,839
I'm just a regular old guy
on the street now.

466
00:35:52,028 --> 00:35:54,622
Welcome to the prep game of the week...

467
00:35:54,731 --> 00:35:56,631
in the Class AA Sectional Final.

468
00:35:56,733 --> 00:36:00,066
You got the guru,
the legend, in Gene Pingatore.

469
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:02,660
Gates.! Good.!

470
00:36:02,772 --> 00:36:05,536
Boy, Gates is on fire.

471
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:07,609
William Gates is one
of the premier sophomores.

472
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,543
William scores
17 points in the first half...

473
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:14,377
as the Chargers look to return
to the state finals.

474
00:36:14,483 --> 00:36:17,145
Gates.

475
00:36:17,253 --> 00:36:19,221
Good.!

476
00:36:20,756 --> 00:36:23,020
He is a thoroughbred of a player.

477
00:36:26,929 --> 00:36:29,159
Can they get it done here now?

478
00:36:29,265 --> 00:36:32,631
In the second half, Gordon Tech
turns to their own sophomore star.

479
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:36,135
Kleinschmidt
drives the middle, puts it up. Good.!

480
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:40,105
Gordon Tech hangs on to a slender
lead in the waning seconds of the game.

481
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:42,108
Three-point lead with 12 seconds left.

482
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,110
My guy's William Gates.

483
00:36:44,212 --> 00:36:47,875
I'd like to see him get it, just get to go
one-on-one and pull up and ice it.

484
00:36:52,387 --> 00:36:54,287
Oh, boy. This is it.

485
00:36:55,623 --> 00:36:58,057
- Gates is the man with the ball.
- That's the one I would want.

486
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:00,922
He's gonna pull up from way out.
Off the front of the rim.!

487
00:37:01,028 --> 00:37:04,293
Kleinschmidt hits it around.
Three seconds left.

488
00:37:04,398 --> 00:37:06,332
Cunningham goes out. It's up.!

489
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:10,062
No good.! Gordon Tech wins.!

490
00:37:13,841 --> 00:37:17,072
Congratulations
to the Gordon Tech Rams.

491
00:37:17,177 --> 00:37:20,305
They're on a joyride,
one game now from Champaign.

492
00:37:40,499 --> 00:37:42,558
Come on.

493
00:37:42,668 --> 00:37:45,364
Arthur's season ended well,
and he has high hopes...

494
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:48,099
to play for the varsity next year.

495
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:53,537
Whoo! Lots of iron on that shit.

496
00:37:55,114 --> 00:37:57,411
Arthur's dad shows up.

497
00:37:57,515 --> 00:37:59,415
Man got big hands.

498
00:37:59,517 --> 00:38:02,145
These days, Arthur rarely sees him.

499
00:38:02,254 --> 00:38:05,280
- Watch this. Watch this dunk.
- Joe, I'm gonna go after you, okay?

500
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,358
Watch this.

501
00:38:15,367 --> 00:38:18,097
You got old legs, Dad.

502
00:38:18,203 --> 00:38:20,103
Old legs.

503
00:38:22,674 --> 00:38:24,904
Hey, man.
I'll see you later on, okay?

504
00:38:26,076 --> 00:38:27,976
Bye.

505
00:38:29,313 --> 00:38:31,611
Increasingly, this playground court...

506
00:38:31,715 --> 00:38:34,684
has become a place
to buy and sell drugs.

507
00:38:50,134 --> 00:38:52,034
"Dear Mother...

508
00:38:52,136 --> 00:38:54,263
"I hope when Mother's Day comes...

509
00:38:54,371 --> 00:38:57,032
"you will light up the sky
with a big smile.

510
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:00,541
"You, Mother,
are the only one in the world...

511
00:39:00,643 --> 00:39:02,941
"who can provide
and take care of me.

512
00:39:03,046 --> 00:39:05,742
"You are the one
that makes our family work.

513
00:39:05,848 --> 00:39:10,251
"You are the one that I will miss so much
when I go away to college.

514
00:39:10,353 --> 00:39:12,913
"No one can replace you ever.

515
00:39:13,022 --> 00:39:15,115
Love always, Man."

516
00:39:16,192 --> 00:39:18,160
Mother's Day, 1989.

517
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:33,307
I said to him,
"What are you gonna do this summer?'"

518
00:39:33,408 --> 00:39:35,740
he said, well, he didn't know.

519
00:39:39,214 --> 00:39:41,444
So I said, "Well, if you need a job...

520
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,450
let me know, and I'll see
if I can help you."

521
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,784
We had a job that didn't require
a lot of previous training...

522
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:49,789
so we hired him.

523
00:39:49,891 --> 00:39:54,327
I messed up so bad on my first day
'cause I wanted to do everything right.

524
00:39:54,428 --> 00:39:57,192
Just messed up everything.

525
00:39:57,298 --> 00:40:00,096
Puttin' tapes in the wrong numbers...

526
00:40:00,201 --> 00:40:02,169
all sorts of stuff.

527
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:08,567
But I just pushed myself
to come out here...

528
00:40:08,676 --> 00:40:12,009
because I know, in the long run,
it's gonna be good for myself...

529
00:40:12,113 --> 00:40:14,843
and for my family.

530
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:18,883
I give my mother $50
out of my checks.

531
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,512
All she done for me, I
don't think there ever

532
00:40:22,513 --> 00:40:24,879
be enough that I can
get to pay her back.

533
00:40:24,991 --> 00:40:27,960
Unless I make pro.
Then I'm pretty sure I can pay her back.

534
00:40:49,149 --> 00:40:51,708
I drew on these.
Look at my name.

535
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,851
Tuss.

536
00:40:59,892 --> 00:41:02,030
I had heard that his
nickname used to be

537
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:04,192
Tuss, so I just started
calling myself Tuss.

538
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:06,821
Say "Tuss. '"

539
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:17,606
You know, I say,
"Man, you may not make it to the NBA. '"

540
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:20,006
he said, "Don't keep on
telling me things like that.

541
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:23,308
That's just like showing me
you don't have any trust in what I do."

542
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:27,783
I said, "I do, but don't just keep
putting everything into this."

543
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,353
he said, "Ain't nobody gonna
take my dream away from me.

544
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:32,855
That's what I wanna be,
and that's what I'm gonna do."

545
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:39,528
Go first.

546
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:43,532
I say, "hey, it's your dream.
What can we do?'"

547
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,534
Yeah!

548
00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:06,751
"Dear William, Georgetown University

549
00:42:06,752 --> 00:42:09,249
basketball staff is very
interested in you. '"

550
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,591
"We are going to kick off the season
with a midnight madness celebration."

551
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:16,432
Bobby Knight called.

552
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:18,830
Michigan State -
boy, do they ever call.

553
00:42:19,668 --> 00:42:22,831
"Will be on national television."

554
00:42:26,342 --> 00:42:28,333
Any school you name.

555
00:42:33,048 --> 00:42:37,246
"Dear William, there's gold
at the end of the rainbow.

556
00:42:38,621 --> 00:42:41,089
$500 in there for you too."

557
00:42:55,236 --> 00:42:57,534
Did you see Isiah play the other night?

558
00:42:57,639 --> 00:42:59,698
Yeah, I caught the end of it.

559
00:42:59,807 --> 00:43:02,105
- how'd you like it?
- He played pretty good.

560
00:43:03,478 --> 00:43:07,107
The whole school
see me as being a Isiah Thomas.

561
00:43:07,215 --> 00:43:09,979
I'm trying to build my own identity.

562
00:43:10,084 --> 00:43:14,043
When I leave, they're gonna be, like,
"You're gonna be the next William Gates. '"

563
00:43:15,989 --> 00:43:18,457
The St. Joseph Chargers
are strictly man-to-man.

564
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:22,120
- Gene Pingatore believes in that system.
- Watch Isiah come.

565
00:43:22,229 --> 00:43:24,993
- Going down the middle, throws it up.
- What did he do?

566
00:43:25,098 --> 00:43:28,067
- he took the charge.
- He took the charge.

567
00:43:28,168 --> 00:43:30,124
Something we have to
get you to do, right?

568
00:43:30,137 --> 00:43:32,104
Yeah.

569
00:43:32,206 --> 00:43:35,039
Everything he does
is what a coach is looking for.

570
00:43:35,142 --> 00:43:37,201
You listening?

571
00:43:37,311 --> 00:43:39,506
Out to Clark.
This is Thomas with the ball again.

572
00:43:39,613 --> 00:43:42,480
What an eye.!

573
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:46,985
You're actually a better shooter
than Isiah from the outside.

574
00:43:47,086 --> 00:43:48,986
True.

575
00:43:49,088 --> 00:43:52,888
That's heads-up ba -
Oh! Thomas! What a move.

576
00:43:52,992 --> 00:43:55,460
That means you have
a lot of responsibility, William.

577
00:43:55,561 --> 00:43:57,620
Can you handle it?

578
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:00,460
I hope so.
I'm ready to go downstate.

579
00:44:00,566 --> 00:44:02,534
- You wanna go downstate?
- Yeah.

580
00:44:02,635 --> 00:44:06,901
You gotta do something about it.
You have two years to get us down there.

581
00:44:07,006 --> 00:44:08,974
It's going to be all on your head.

582
00:44:09,075 --> 00:44:12,704
Isiah Thomas has just hit his 20th point.

583
00:44:13,745 --> 00:44:15,645
Go.!

584
00:44:16,681 --> 00:44:19,775
Hold up.! William.

585
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:25,415
The man playing defense
dropped way off here.

586
00:44:25,523 --> 00:44:28,321
Now, who would you rather
have shoot the ball?

587
00:44:28,426 --> 00:44:31,623
Stras shoot the ball there,
or you stop in here and shootin' the ball?

588
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:34,096
- Me.
- Well, shoot it!

589
00:44:35,233 --> 00:44:36,587
William practices today

590
00:44:36,588 --> 00:44:39,192
having just recovered
from a slight knee injury.

591
00:44:40,705 --> 00:44:43,138
Come on. Let's go.
You're playing soft.

592
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,936
William? Does it bother you?

593
00:44:46,043 --> 00:44:48,375
Don't be afraid though.
Don't favor it.

594
00:44:48,479 --> 00:44:51,846
Tempo.! Tempo.!

595
00:44:51,949 --> 00:44:54,941
Hold it. That's bullshit!

596
00:44:55,052 --> 00:44:57,987
You didn't jump to the ball
and deny the man!

597
00:44:58,088 --> 00:44:59,988
Go!

598
00:45:04,762 --> 00:45:06,821
That's still one.

599
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:11,192
Nope. It's still one.

600
00:45:12,268 --> 00:45:16,170
We'll stay here all day
until you get a 10-seconder.

601
00:45:16,272 --> 00:45:18,172
William, you gotta take it easy.

602
00:45:20,209 --> 00:45:22,734
Go!

603
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,437
Go!

604
00:45:24,547 --> 00:45:26,447
Go.

605
00:45:31,287 --> 00:45:33,721
Now we start all over.

606
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:36,485
You people just refuse to work.

607
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:41,852
You don't know what it is
to be intense!

608
00:45:41,963 --> 00:45:45,922
And if you don't have it,
you're gonna be crap for this team.!

609
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:48,901
Give me a good reason why I should
keep you on this team, Corey.

610
00:45:49,004 --> 00:45:52,098
How 'bout you, Reed?
Give me a good reason.

611
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:54,971
What do you think, William?

612
00:45:55,077 --> 00:45:57,511
I mean, how many of these people
work hard?

613
00:45:57,612 --> 00:45:59,910
- Not too many.
- Not too many.

614
00:46:00,015 --> 00:46:03,451
Wanna stay home
when the state tournament comes?

615
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,220
All right. Go on in.

616
00:46:18,699 --> 00:46:22,533
The next day in practice,
William reinjures his knee.

617
00:46:30,478 --> 00:46:34,414
You, most likely,
have at least torn this cartilage...

618
00:46:34,515 --> 00:46:36,380
the inside cartilage of your knee.

619
00:46:37,651 --> 00:46:41,916
And you may have
a ligament tear in your knee, okay?

620
00:46:43,289 --> 00:46:46,588
If the ligament is torn, William,
you would miss this year...

621
00:46:46,693 --> 00:46:48,661
entirely.

622
00:46:48,762 --> 00:46:52,698
This is a lot to happen to you
at an early age. A lot.

623
00:46:52,799 --> 00:46:54,733
I think, if all goes well...

624
00:46:54,834 --> 00:46:56,802
you'll be able to come back.

625
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:14,512
Everything was just going great.

626
00:47:15,554 --> 00:47:17,454
Now this.

627
00:47:23,195 --> 00:47:25,663
All you guys can't get large.

628
00:47:26,999 --> 00:47:29,194
- Somebody accidentally-
- What's up, man?

629
00:47:29,301 --> 00:47:32,566
Somebody gotta wear medium. You little
skinny guys wanna get in a large.

630
00:47:32,671 --> 00:47:34,571
What the other guys gonna put on?

631
00:47:34,673 --> 00:47:37,072
Watch that boy.
He'll steal your drawers.

632
00:47:37,175 --> 00:47:41,305
Junior year, Arthur makes varsity
for the Marshall Commandos.

633
00:47:57,228 --> 00:47:59,696
This is the year, right?

634
00:47:59,797 --> 00:48:02,129
This is it.
All righty.

635
00:48:02,233 --> 00:48:04,428
Not too bad.

636
00:48:04,535 --> 00:48:06,365
Fine.

637
00:48:13,276 --> 00:48:16,905
Back home,
the family's troubles have worsened.

638
00:48:17,013 --> 00:48:19,709
Now I'm on welfare...

639
00:48:19,816 --> 00:48:21,784
that I wasn't on then.

640
00:48:22,819 --> 00:48:27,347
And trying to live month-to-month
on something like that is very hard.

641
00:48:27,457 --> 00:48:30,187
You have three growing kids
that need this...

642
00:48:30,293 --> 00:48:32,523
and you have bills to pay...

643
00:48:32,629 --> 00:48:36,086
and it's just not enough
to make ends meet.

644
00:48:39,635 --> 00:48:43,935
Man.! Sweetie, is Man in there?

645
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:46,803
I was never raised on welfare.

646
00:48:46,909 --> 00:48:50,208
My mother and father both worked.

647
00:48:53,649 --> 00:48:56,618
We was cut off for three months.

648
00:48:56,719 --> 00:48:59,244
We was cut off aid complete
with no income.

649
00:48:59,355 --> 00:49:01,482
So, therefore,
do you know what happened?

650
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:04,023
Our lights were cut off.
Our gas was cut off.

651
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:06,320
And we were sittin' in the dark.

652
00:49:16,004 --> 00:49:19,770
They had cut me off because
I failed to meet an appointment.

653
00:49:28,082 --> 00:49:31,415
It hurt everybody.
It changed everybody's attitude.

654
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:35,079
That you can have something today
and it's gone tomorrow.

655
00:49:37,291 --> 00:49:40,385
So you know what the system
is saying to me?

656
00:49:40,494 --> 00:49:44,555
Do you know what it's saying
to a lot of women in my predicament?

657
00:49:44,665 --> 00:49:46,656
They don't care.

658
00:50:16,362 --> 00:50:19,820
The good news is
that your ligament looks fine.

659
00:50:19,932 --> 00:50:22,492
- Good.
- Okay? Your ligament looks fine.

660
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:25,230
We can actually
sew the cartilage back.

661
00:50:25,338 --> 00:50:30,071
So you're looking at a minimum
of 12 weeks, maybe 16 weeks...

662
00:50:30,176 --> 00:50:32,905
before I'll let you play ball again.

663
00:50:33,011 --> 00:50:36,139
Possibly being able to play
by tournament time.

664
00:50:36,247 --> 00:50:38,147
Okay?

665
00:50:45,123 --> 00:50:48,115
I'm gonna slip you a little something
into the I.V...

666
00:50:48,226 --> 00:50:50,922
to kind of take the edge
off of things, okay?

667
00:50:51,029 --> 00:50:52,963
All right?

668
00:50:53,064 --> 00:50:55,294
- I can tell.
- Yeah.

669
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,300
No doubt.

670
00:51:13,851 --> 00:51:16,786
- Let's turn him.
- Yeah, this way.

671
00:51:17,821 --> 00:51:20,051
If it stays there.

672
00:51:20,157 --> 00:51:23,684
Probably go with the right post here
and little stuff.

673
00:51:28,465 --> 00:51:32,093
The doctor told me he wasn't gonna even
try to get him ready to play this year.

674
00:51:32,201 --> 00:51:35,659
So what do you think
that goin' do to his career?

675
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:47,949
I really thought Curtis
was gonna make it.

676
00:51:49,986 --> 00:51:52,784
But he didn't make it,
so I just wanted to try-

677
00:51:52,889 --> 00:51:55,357
I just wanted this one to make it.

678
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:01,488
We were able to repair the cartilage.

679
00:52:01,596 --> 00:52:03,496
Okay?

680
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,469
When basketball is over,
William may not have a friend in the world.

681
00:52:16,912 --> 00:52:19,642
Curtis lost his job as a security guard...

682
00:52:19,748 --> 00:52:22,774
and has been unemployed
for over four months.

683
00:52:22,884 --> 00:52:25,751
Sometimes I sit around
and my eyes just kinda get watery...

684
00:52:25,854 --> 00:52:28,720
'cause I be, like,
I ain't amounted to nothing.

685
00:52:28,823 --> 00:52:31,087
You know, I ain't got nothing.

686
00:52:31,192 --> 00:52:36,528
I can't even go out there and get a job
making seven dollars an hour.

687
00:52:37,698 --> 00:52:41,156
I'll be sitting there telling myself,
"You ain't gonna get no better. '"

688
00:52:48,609 --> 00:52:51,237
What did y'all tell me about
after y'all go to college and everything...

689
00:52:51,345 --> 00:52:53,245
y'all get your own place?

690
00:52:53,347 --> 00:52:55,837
We can all go to Arby's, baby.!

691
00:52:55,949 --> 00:52:58,975
- And get fresh Matt's Cookies.
- And going to Jewel’s for our meat.

692
00:52:59,085 --> 00:53:03,454
- That's a lot of food stamps.
- We ain't gonna need no food stamps.

693
00:53:05,024 --> 00:53:07,720
Each day is a struggle.

694
00:53:07,827 --> 00:53:10,421
Trying to deal with the kids' attitudes
as well as my own...

695
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:13,431
and trying to be strong enough
for them and myself.

696
00:53:13,533 --> 00:53:15,797
- That is so neat.
- I forgot to turn in my work.

697
00:53:15,902 --> 00:53:18,462
That is what you call a neat paper.
Yeah, that's neat.

698
00:53:18,571 --> 00:53:21,369
Don't you say that about my son.

699
00:53:21,474 --> 00:53:23,601
My son got a brain.
Now, you cut that out.

700
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:25,836
- But he don't use it.
- See that brain there?

701
00:53:25,944 --> 00:53:28,606
Now there are two
new members of the Agee household.

702
00:53:28,714 --> 00:53:33,174
Arthur's sister Tomika
has a baby girl named Jazz.

703
00:53:33,285 --> 00:53:36,743
And Arthur's best friend Shannon moved in
to escape his own troubled home.

704
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,982
Shannon is like me.

705
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:42,560
He understood me,
and I understood him.

706
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:46,998
He could sit back and talk to me
'cause I was his best friend.

707
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:48,999
He trusted me, and I trust him.

708
00:53:51,403 --> 00:53:55,361
It's been crazy, as far as his father
and his mother's breakup.

709
00:53:55,473 --> 00:54:00,410
He'll come home,
and Bo stealing and buying drugs...

710
00:54:00,511 --> 00:54:02,945
and beat on his mother and stuff.

711
00:54:05,516 --> 00:54:08,542
You have to call the police
or get an order of protection...

712
00:54:08,653 --> 00:54:10,621
for him to leave me alone.

713
00:54:29,706 --> 00:54:32,869
My father was the same way.

714
00:54:32,976 --> 00:54:36,104
I think about it all the time,
when you come home, and they fightin'.

715
00:54:36,213 --> 00:54:39,239
You know, that gets to a child's head.

716
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:42,250
They can't - Especially when you're
living with your mother...

717
00:54:42,352 --> 00:54:45,788
and you young,
and that's all you see all the time.

718
00:54:47,791 --> 00:54:50,555
He had to do something
to keep his spirit up.

719
00:54:56,632 --> 00:54:58,600
Ahh!

720
00:55:05,074 --> 00:55:06,974
Why you -

721
00:55:10,379 --> 00:55:14,816
Starting at guard,
number 11, a junior, Arthur Agee.!

722
00:55:14,917 --> 00:55:17,477
When I played basketball,
I knew what I wanted to do.

723
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,488
This is what I want, you know.

724
00:55:20,588 --> 00:55:23,557
This is what I wanna do
for the rest of my life.

725
00:55:28,396 --> 00:55:30,261
Come on, win it, boy!

726
00:55:34,736 --> 00:55:36,636
Get that ball.!

727
00:55:38,606 --> 00:55:41,473
He's way behind
where I think he should be at this point.

728
00:55:41,576 --> 00:55:43,840
I've had a few guys come
to me from college -

729
00:55:43,945 --> 00:55:46,470
"Ooh, I like that kid.
He's quick, he's fast."

730
00:55:46,581 --> 00:55:48,913
But something's missing with Art.

731
00:55:56,723 --> 00:55:58,691
Shannon was on the basketball team too.

732
00:55:58,792 --> 00:56:02,558
He was a little more raw
than Arthur is.

733
00:56:02,663 --> 00:56:04,631
I couldn't handle two guys like that...

734
00:56:04,731 --> 00:56:08,098
so I tried the lesser of the evils.

735
00:56:08,201 --> 00:56:10,101
That was Arthur.

736
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:17,166
Marshall's won six and lost 14...

737
00:56:17,277 --> 00:56:19,744
their worst record in 20 years.

738
00:56:19,845 --> 00:56:22,177
You just in a hurry to do nothing...

739
00:56:22,281 --> 00:56:25,216
'cause that's exactly
what you're doing - nothing.

740
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:33,715
After spending
most of the game on the bench...

741
00:56:33,826 --> 00:56:36,386
Arthur gets another chance.

742
00:56:36,495 --> 00:56:39,692
Get that ball.! Work that ball, boy.!

743
00:56:39,799 --> 00:56:43,200
Yes.! That's the way you do it.!

744
00:56:45,104 --> 00:56:47,299
In the final minutes of a close game...

745
00:56:47,406 --> 00:56:50,306
Arthur takes it strong to the hoop.

746
00:56:52,277 --> 00:56:55,405
He's called for charging
and fouls out of the game.

747
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:19,602
- There's been some bad calls all day.
- Amen!

748
00:57:19,703 --> 00:57:22,570
I'm telling you. Oh!

749
00:57:41,525 --> 00:57:43,652
The daily regimen of rehabilitation...

750
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:46,092
is not the only change
in William's life.

751
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,265
Say "hey!"

752
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:53,301
- hey!
- Say "hey!"

753
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:02,868
I was just basically scared to tell people.

754
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:05,038
I was feelin' sick, you know...

755
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,048
holding all this stuff
inside of me.

756
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,050
I couldn't let it out.

757
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:13,544
When I did finally tell Coach,
he was like, "When did this come about?'"

758
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:14,587
And I said...

759
00:58:14,689 --> 00:58:17,658
"Oh... three, four months ago."

760
00:58:19,795 --> 00:58:21,820
he was like,
"Three or four months ago?"

761
00:58:23,265 --> 00:58:25,165
I was in the delivery room.

762
00:58:25,267 --> 00:58:27,167
The nurses gave her to her...

763
00:58:27,269 --> 00:58:30,170
and she handed the baby to me,
you know.

764
00:58:30,272 --> 00:58:33,173
And I'll never forget
how hard she was squeezing my hand.

765
00:58:35,277 --> 00:58:38,269
Once we got her home
William offered his help and stuff...

766
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:41,838
but it was almost like I didn't want it
'cause she was mine.

767
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:44,144
You know?
Instead of the two of us.

768
00:58:44,251 --> 00:58:49,018
So then, after a while we -
I finally let him keep her.

769
00:58:49,123 --> 00:58:51,250
And he earned his title.

770
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:54,122
You smell good.

771
00:59:18,618 --> 00:59:21,348
Your numbers look real good.

772
00:59:21,454 --> 00:59:25,254
I think you're two to three weeks away
from being able to practice full.

773
00:59:25,358 --> 00:59:28,919
- You know what I mean?
- Two or three weeks?

774
00:59:29,028 --> 00:59:31,080
I know you wanted to waltz in here today

775
00:59:31,081 --> 00:59:33,658
and I'd tell you to go back
to practice right now...

776
00:59:33,766 --> 00:59:36,599
but I don't want it
to have to tear again.

777
00:59:37,837 --> 00:59:41,636
I felt that this was the year for me.

778
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:57,314
I know we can make it downstate.

779
00:59:57,422 --> 00:59:59,754
That's just a big dream I done had.

780
01:00:03,428 --> 01:00:06,056
I look up on the scoreboard-

781
01:00:07,166 --> 01:00:10,033
My name is not even on there anymore.

782
01:00:12,203 --> 01:00:15,172
Where do I fit in with this team?

783
01:00:22,513 --> 01:00:24,913
William takes a makeup exam in math...

784
01:00:25,016 --> 01:00:27,211
because he skipped the final.

785
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:35,955
Here's the cutoff point for passing.

786
01:00:37,395 --> 01:00:40,124
And you ended up right there.

787
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:42,755
So you passed the final - barely.

788
01:00:42,866 --> 01:00:47,826
When I stopped playing ball,
all my grades just sunk.

789
01:00:48,939 --> 01:00:52,340
I understand we, uh -
we got the A.C.T. results.

790
01:00:52,442 --> 01:00:54,342
Yeah.

791
01:00:54,444 --> 01:00:57,675
Not as good as we, uh -
we wanted, huh?

792
01:01:03,553 --> 01:01:07,011
William scores a 15 on his first A.C. T.

793
01:01:07,123 --> 01:01:11,024
He needs to score an 18 to qualify
for an athletic scholarship...

794
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:13,026
to any four-year university.

795
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:17,360
I think what we have to do is get you
set up with the Britannica course.

796
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:21,232
We'll have to talk to Mrs. Wier.
Okay?

797
01:01:22,738 --> 01:01:25,764
Sometimes you have had the right answer
and you changed it to the wrong answer.

798
01:01:25,874 --> 01:01:28,809
Through Patricia Wier,
William's St. Joe's sponsor...

799
01:01:28,911 --> 01:01:32,210
the cost of the six-week class is waived.

800
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:34,145
If you're just outright guessing -

801
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:35,745
If a monkey took this test

802
01:01:35,746 --> 01:01:38,447
and you trained him to
do just B's and C's...

803
01:01:38,553 --> 01:01:42,683
he probably would get more right
than if he picked A's and D's.

804
01:01:45,093 --> 01:01:46,993
You just don't know the feeling...

805
01:01:47,095 --> 01:01:48,995
not knowing
if you gonna be able to play...

806
01:01:49,097 --> 01:01:50,997
just because of a test.

807
01:01:51,099 --> 01:01:54,070
I mean, as soon as you
don't tighten one screw,

808
01:01:54,071 --> 01:01:55,468
everything falls apart.

809
01:01:56,771 --> 01:01:59,672
- El caballo.
- El caballo.

810
01:01:59,774 --> 01:02:02,004
- La vaca.
- La vaca.

811
01:02:02,110 --> 01:02:06,240
Arthur, ¿Tienes tu el libro?
¿Tienes tu el libro?

812
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:08,837
Mmm.

813
01:02:11,218 --> 01:02:14,915
- What do I say?
- Okay, how do you say "yes"?

814
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:16,922
"Yoy. '"

815
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:19,424
- how do you say "yes" in Spanish?
- Sם.

816
01:02:19,526 --> 01:02:23,189
Sם. Look up on the board.

817
01:02:25,332 --> 01:02:29,098
He's a pretty smart kid,
but he does just enough to pass.

818
01:02:29,202 --> 01:02:31,102
Hey, Shannon!

819
01:02:31,204 --> 01:02:34,105
Most of them
that have come through here...

820
01:02:34,207 --> 01:02:36,106
and had that type of attitude...

821
01:02:36,208 --> 01:02:37,418
usually end up in the streets

822
01:02:37,419 --> 01:02:39,234
talkin' about they used
to play for Marshall...

823
01:02:39,345 --> 01:02:42,781
and if they'd gone to class they could've
gone to any school they wanted to.

824
01:02:42,882 --> 01:02:45,976
This is just somebody
standing on the street corner talking...

825
01:02:46,085 --> 01:02:49,282
trying to find a job, then can't
find a job, that kind of thing.

826
01:02:49,388 --> 01:02:51,356
This is where he's headed, really.

827
01:03:03,069 --> 01:03:05,536
- how's your knee?
- It's pretty good.

828
01:03:05,637 --> 01:03:10,301
Easiest thing right now would be for you
not to play and wait till next year.

829
01:03:10,408 --> 01:03:12,171
What do you wanna do?

830
01:03:12,277 --> 01:03:14,177
- Wait till next year?
- Right.

831
01:03:14,279 --> 01:03:16,338
- No.
- You think you're ready?

832
01:03:18,016 --> 01:03:19,984
My next year is now.

833
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:32,061
I've seen athletes
who have come back from surgery...

834
01:03:32,163 --> 01:03:35,063
where they worried about the injury.

835
01:03:35,165 --> 01:03:38,965
When this happens,
they may never be the player they were.

836
01:03:47,111 --> 01:03:48,496
William's first start

837
01:03:48,497 --> 01:03:51,207
is the final home game
of the regular season.

838
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:01,557
William should have shot it.

839
01:04:06,863 --> 01:04:10,299
He gotta do that the whole game.
He only do it when they leadin'.

840
01:04:16,572 --> 01:04:19,666
It was like my injury
was making him look bad.

841
01:04:19,776 --> 01:04:21,676
Run it out.!

842
01:04:21,778 --> 01:04:24,246
I always felt that Curtis...

843
01:04:24,347 --> 01:04:26,815
should not be living his dream
through me.

844
01:04:36,224 --> 01:04:38,598
If he don't do somethin'
out here on this court -

845
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:40,354
Man, he ain't showed me nothin' yet.

846
01:04:40,462 --> 01:04:43,363
You gotta come out
and start playing hard all the time.

847
01:04:43,465 --> 01:04:45,695
Otherwise
you're just another player.

848
01:04:45,801 --> 01:04:48,702
You follow me?
Just remember the way we talked.

849
01:04:48,804 --> 01:04:50,599
Okay? As long as you're physically able.

850
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,797
If you're not, you
shouldn't be playing at all.

851
01:04:52,908 --> 01:04:56,002
So nervous about the start tonight.

852
01:04:57,179 --> 01:04:59,079
But I'm glad it's over with.

853
01:04:59,181 --> 01:05:01,080
Now I can just...

854
01:05:01,182 --> 01:05:03,844
get onto the floor more better.

855
01:05:09,056 --> 01:05:10,956
Spread the floor to four corners!

856
01:05:11,058 --> 01:05:13,959
St. Joe's has made it to the sectionals.

857
01:05:15,129 --> 01:05:17,563
And in the final minutes...

858
01:05:17,665 --> 01:05:21,362
William goes to the free throw line
with the Chargers leading by six.

859
01:05:33,112 --> 01:05:35,080
Always a clutch free-throw shooter...

860
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:40,312
he sinks four straight
to help seal the victory.

861
01:05:49,462 --> 01:05:51,487
In the sectional finals...

862
01:05:51,598 --> 01:05:53,691
St. Joe's looks for revenge
against Gordon Tech...

863
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,428
the team that knocked them out
last year.

864
01:05:59,671 --> 01:06:02,105
With his whole family watching...

865
01:06:02,207 --> 01:06:06,007
William seems out of sync
and bothered by his knee.

866
01:06:08,747 --> 01:06:10,647
You are not working hard enough!

867
01:06:10,749 --> 01:06:13,513
You understand me?
They want it harder than you!

868
01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:16,087
At the beginning of the fourth quarter...

869
01:06:16,188 --> 01:06:18,486
St. Joe's leads by a point.

870
01:06:34,672 --> 01:06:36,572
Got any pain with that?

871
01:06:36,674 --> 01:06:38,733
While the doctor examines William's knee...

872
01:06:38,843 --> 01:06:40,606
Gordon Tech surges ahead.

873
01:07:02,299 --> 01:07:05,700
The Chargers steal the ball,
trailing by one.

874
01:07:05,802 --> 01:07:07,793
William calls time-out.

875
01:07:09,739 --> 01:07:13,175
I want it down floor so we can get
it to one of our good jumpers.

876
01:07:14,277 --> 01:07:16,177
With only seconds on the clock...

877
01:07:16,279 --> 01:07:18,747
the Chargers find William
in the corner.

878
01:07:22,519 --> 01:07:25,487
The shot doesn't fall,
but William is fouled.

879
01:07:28,757 --> 01:07:31,123
With six seconds to go...

880
01:07:31,226 --> 01:07:34,127
William steps to the line
with two free throws...

881
01:07:34,229 --> 01:07:36,129
and a chance to win.

882
01:08:37,724 --> 01:08:40,625
He shouldn't have been out there.
He shouldn't have been playing.

883
01:08:40,727 --> 01:08:43,161
- The knee?
- I'm very disappointed.

884
01:08:43,263 --> 01:08:45,697
Y'all get that on tape 18 times.

885
01:08:45,799 --> 01:08:48,700
Disappointed in the system.
He shouldn't have been out there playing.

886
01:08:48,802 --> 01:08:51,703
His knee came out of place
a couple of times, it looked like.

887
01:08:51,805 --> 01:08:54,602
I mean, if winning's that important,
we need to reevaluate the program.

888
01:08:54,707 --> 01:08:59,337
That ain't no excuse. he got out there,
said there wasn't nothin' wrong with him.

889
01:08:59,445 --> 01:09:01,345
That's an excuse.

890
01:09:01,447 --> 01:09:04,416
If he was hurt,
he shouldn't have got out there.

891
01:09:31,009 --> 01:09:33,204
There's two possible problems
you could have.

892
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:36,144
You might have healed,
say, 80% of that cartilage...

893
01:09:36,247 --> 01:09:38,044
and still have
a small residual tear.

894
01:09:38,149 --> 01:09:40,049
William's brother-in-law, Alvin...

895
01:09:40,151 --> 01:09:43,348
takes him to see Dr. Hefferon,
the Chicago Bulls team doctor.

896
01:09:43,455 --> 01:09:46,424
What you need to do is have
your knee arthroscoped again.

897
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,659
- What side we gonna do?
- Right side.

898
01:09:50,761 --> 01:09:52,661
Right.

899
01:09:52,763 --> 01:09:54,387
A lot of people say I shouldn't

900
01:09:54,388 --> 01:09:56,631
have played, shouldn't
have came back at all.

901
01:09:59,336 --> 01:10:01,804
Coach kept sayin'
it's really up to me...

902
01:10:01,905 --> 01:10:05,397
and if you leave it up to me
I'm goin' back out there on the court.

903
01:10:06,443 --> 01:10:10,846
We're gonna remove
this portion of the cartilage here.

904
01:10:10,948 --> 01:10:14,475
He'll have a higher incidence of arthritis
as he gets older than you or I would.

905
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:19,578
But in terms of his basketball career,
he has a good chance of performing fine.

906
01:10:19,689 --> 01:10:21,623
- There's the medial meniscus.
- Wow.

907
01:10:27,563 --> 01:10:30,964
It's the only thing on my mind,
is gettin' downstate...

908
01:10:31,067 --> 01:10:33,126
is makin' it down there.

909
01:10:33,236 --> 01:10:36,899
I want to be able to go all out
the whole year.

910
01:10:37,006 --> 01:10:38,906
No setbacks, no nothin'.

911
01:10:39,008 --> 01:10:41,909
At least Coach won't have to say, "William,
you didn't play hard this game"...

912
01:10:42,011 --> 01:10:45,845
'cause when I step on that floor
I'm goin' be all business, and that's it.

913
01:10:50,619 --> 01:10:52,519
One year after he left...

914
01:10:52,621 --> 01:10:55,522
Arthur's dad Bo rejoins the family.

915
01:10:55,624 --> 01:10:58,218
He spent seven months in jail
for burglary...

916
01:10:58,326 --> 01:11:01,022
and overcame an addiction
to crack cocaine.

917
01:11:01,129 --> 01:11:04,895
Man might fail ya, but Jesus never fails.!

918
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,629
Praise God.! Whoo.!
If you haven't tried him, try him.!

919
01:11:08,737 --> 01:11:11,900
Sometimes you look for friends
and they're not there.

920
01:11:12,007 --> 01:11:14,168
- But Jesus is always there.
- Amen.!

921
01:11:14,276 --> 01:11:17,143
- Even in the midnight hour, he's there.
- Amen.

922
01:11:17,245 --> 01:11:19,337
Glory to God.! Whoo.!

923
01:11:19,446 --> 01:11:21,744
- hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

924
01:11:23,851 --> 01:11:25,751
Glory to God.

925
01:11:25,853 --> 01:11:29,345
Lord, we know
you always bless the family.

926
01:11:29,456 --> 01:11:34,894
Glory to God. Even in the beginning, Lord,
you blessed that first family.

927
01:11:34,995 --> 01:11:38,624
Glory to God. We pray right now,
don't let nothin' come between 'em.

928
01:11:39,733 --> 01:11:43,726
Send strength, Lord, glory to God,
wherever there is weakness.

929
01:11:44,772 --> 01:11:46,671
Please, Lord...

930
01:11:46,773 --> 01:11:48,866
let the love prevail.

931
01:12:00,086 --> 01:12:02,281
- Yeah.!
- Thank you, Jesus.! Thank you, Lord.!

932
01:12:04,824 --> 01:12:06,724
That's right.

933
01:12:15,168 --> 01:12:17,192
While I was incarcerated...

934
01:12:17,302 --> 01:12:20,203
I just asked God,
"Show me a different way.

935
01:12:20,305 --> 01:12:24,105
Give me a new life. Take the taste of drugs
and evil way of thinkin' away from me. '"

936
01:12:24,209 --> 01:12:27,110
I asked the Lord
to forgive me for what I did...

937
01:12:27,212 --> 01:12:31,911
the times that I mistreated my wife,
beat her physically, you know.

938
01:12:39,391 --> 01:12:42,292
I just hope this be
a lesson to my children...

939
01:12:42,394 --> 01:12:45,089
to see me turn my life
over to the Lord.

940
01:12:57,074 --> 01:12:58,974
Oh, yeah.!

941
01:13:04,248 --> 01:13:06,148
When I was little...

942
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:08,218
he had let me down.

943
01:13:10,187 --> 01:13:14,850
People used to come up to me -
"Your father a drug addict" and stuff.

944
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:17,222
And I'd just be, like, "Yeah, okay."

945
01:13:17,327 --> 01:13:18,794
You know?

946
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:22,964
And I used to take so much,
you know...

947
01:13:23,066 --> 01:13:25,899
that he has to start realizin'
that, you know -

948
01:13:26,002 --> 01:13:28,436
that what is he doing, you know.

949
01:13:29,873 --> 01:13:31,081
'Cause I remember sometimes

950
01:13:31,082 --> 01:13:33,274
he used to try to go to
church while he still -

951
01:13:33,376 --> 01:13:36,402
he was still on drugs
while he was tryin' to go to church.

952
01:13:37,447 --> 01:13:39,347
Give me a hug before you go.

953
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:41,349
- Give your granddad a hug.
- Thank you!

954
01:13:41,451 --> 01:13:45,386
The closeness was not there at first,
when I come back home.

955
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:49,116
And then Arthur,
he was watchin' me-

956
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:51,124
What move would I make now?

957
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:53,126
Am I just...

958
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:55,958
bein' like this
since I just come back...

959
01:13:56,065 --> 01:13:59,159
or am I gonna break bad again?

960
01:14:14,148 --> 01:14:18,016
William's dad invites him
down to his auto repair shop.

961
01:14:18,119 --> 01:14:22,351
He hasn't lived with the family
since William was a baby.

962
01:14:22,457 --> 01:14:25,483
The car that I was gonna give you,
uh, I didn't finish it up yet.

963
01:14:25,593 --> 01:14:28,027
I got some more to do to it yet.

964
01:14:28,129 --> 01:14:30,689
I didn't see him for, like, three years.

965
01:14:30,798 --> 01:14:33,198
It never popped in my mind.

966
01:14:33,301 --> 01:14:36,429
- The car back there?
- No, that's the car right over there.

967
01:14:36,537 --> 01:14:38,505
That black Cutlass right there.

968
01:14:39,607 --> 01:14:41,506
I think he's, like...

969
01:14:41,608 --> 01:14:44,406
"Oh, he really must be able
to play some basketball. '"

970
01:14:44,511 --> 01:14:47,412
I think now he sees
somethin' at the end for himself.

971
01:14:51,585 --> 01:14:55,919
I remember one time he tried to whup me,
but I wouldn't let him.

972
01:14:56,023 --> 01:15:00,926
I said, "You may be my dad biologically,
but as far as being there-

973
01:15:01,028 --> 01:15:02,996
Enough. '"

974
01:15:04,865 --> 01:15:07,925
You say you'd like to come
to my next show that I do?

975
01:15:08,035 --> 01:15:10,059
Yeah, come out and...

976
01:15:10,169 --> 01:15:12,660
finally get a chance
to see you sing and -

977
01:15:12,772 --> 01:15:14,376
Okay. What I'll
have to do

978
01:15:14,389 --> 01:15:16,003
- I don't have my schedules
right this minute.

979
01:15:16,108 --> 01:15:19,236
But I'll have to get that,
and I'll let you know.

980
01:15:29,288 --> 01:15:31,381
Alicia, you're my only friend.

981
01:15:32,425 --> 01:15:34,325
"A'wight? Jimmi-fi."

982
01:15:34,427 --> 01:15:36,088
Thank you.

983
01:15:37,263 --> 01:15:41,665
I always knew that I was
gonna be a better dad than he was.

984
01:15:41,766 --> 01:15:44,826
I wouldn’t just leave her like that.

985
01:15:44,936 --> 01:15:47,131
- Alicia?
- Hmm? Yes, Mama?

986
01:15:47,238 --> 01:15:50,366
If Alicia has a problem,
then I have a problem.

987
01:15:52,977 --> 01:15:55,172
She's believing whatever she said.

988
01:16:07,458 --> 01:16:09,517
William's second rehabilitation...

989
01:16:09,626 --> 01:16:11,321
is at the Baxter Clinic...

990
01:16:11,428 --> 01:16:14,829
used by many
of Chicago's pro athletes.

991
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:18,184
Both of William's operations and rehabs

992
01:16:18,185 --> 01:16:20,629
have been paid for by
the school's insurance.

993
01:16:25,642 --> 01:16:28,634
Don't expect to be playing in a game
the first day back.

994
01:16:28,745 --> 01:16:31,578
My mother put a big restriction
on those pickups.

995
01:16:33,684 --> 01:16:36,481
She said, "These are her knees now."

996
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:40,418
When you're out on a date,
do you have to have sex?

997
01:16:40,523 --> 01:16:42,889
- No! No! No!
- Yes, you do!

998
01:16:42,992 --> 01:16:46,325
No, you don't!

999
01:16:46,429 --> 01:16:50,024
What about the woman's perspective?

1000
01:16:51,134 --> 01:16:54,035
All right, quiet down a minute here.!

1001
01:16:54,137 --> 01:16:57,834
For the second straight year,
Arthur and Shannon must take summer school.

1002
01:16:57,940 --> 01:17:00,841
- Restate your question.
- What'd I say?

1003
01:17:00,943 --> 01:17:02,968
Shut up!

1004
01:17:03,079 --> 01:17:06,138
This class
is for freshmen, sophomores and juniors...

1005
01:17:06,248 --> 01:17:09,217
who have failed English.

1006
01:17:09,317 --> 01:17:11,217
The basic problem here...

1007
01:17:11,319 --> 01:17:13,219
is that we were strapped for money...

1008
01:17:13,321 --> 01:17:17,655
and we only had one English class
available to our students.

1009
01:17:17,759 --> 01:17:20,956
Hopefully you could touch a nerve
in some of them...

1010
01:17:21,062 --> 01:17:25,362
like a spirited discussion
on a controversial topic.

1011
01:17:25,467 --> 01:17:27,992
Because exactly what is having sex...

1012
01:17:28,103 --> 01:17:32,437
but engaging in an act
that doesn't fulfill -

1013
01:17:32,541 --> 01:17:35,441
Shannon really didn't care...

1014
01:17:35,543 --> 01:17:37,443
so he just stopped coming...

1015
01:17:37,545 --> 01:17:40,275
and he was dropped
from the roll.

1016
01:17:40,381 --> 01:17:43,043
Usually in an illicit-

1017
01:17:44,318 --> 01:17:46,718
Even if Arthur passes summer school...

1018
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:49,721
he may not graduate
with his class next year...

1019
01:17:49,823 --> 01:17:53,350
because St. Joseph's is refusing
to release his transcripts.

1020
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,360
I called up the school.

1021
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:58,920
The lady explained to me
that he owed $1,800...

1022
01:17:59,033 --> 01:18:02,628
so I felt, well, they have
a school policy there...

1023
01:18:02,736 --> 01:18:06,330
and there's, uh, nothing
I can do about that.

1024
01:18:18,484 --> 01:18:20,918
About how much can you afford?

1025
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:23,511
Okay, we're looking at 18-

1026
01:18:23,623 --> 01:18:26,524
- 13. 10.
- Oh.

1027
01:18:26,626 --> 01:18:28,526
13.10?

1028
01:18:28,628 --> 01:18:30,653
1,813. 10.

1029
01:18:31,698 --> 01:18:34,291
Well, to total that out...

1030
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:36,959
and from here to -

1031
01:18:37,069 --> 01:18:39,469
June -When is graduation?

1032
01:18:39,571 --> 01:18:42,540
We're looking at somewhere around-

1033
01:18:43,809 --> 01:18:46,539
It's 181.30 per month.

1034
01:18:46,645 --> 01:18:50,547
Is there any way possible that his-
I don't know. I'm just asking.

1035
01:18:50,649 --> 01:18:54,141
- Sure.
- Could his credits be released too?

1036
01:18:54,253 --> 01:18:58,747
I will get a promissory agreement
drawn up. Okay?

1037
01:18:58,857 --> 01:19:01,552
As long as you show me good faith
after the first two months...

1038
01:19:01,659 --> 01:19:04,025
I'll release 'em, uh -

1039
01:19:04,128 --> 01:19:06,028
That would be end of September.

1040
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:08,030
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

1041
01:19:08,132 --> 01:19:11,033
- Then I'll send 'em to Marshall.
- Okay. That would be fine with us.

1042
01:19:11,135 --> 01:19:13,501
- I really appreciate this.
- How's Arthur doing, anyway?

1043
01:19:13,604 --> 01:19:16,471
Pretty good.
I can't really complain about him.

1044
01:19:16,574 --> 01:19:19,304
- Good.
- Wish he could've stayed here, though.

1045
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:21,310
- Yeah. Me too.
- Well, things-

1046
01:19:21,412 --> 01:19:24,643
- Things happen, you know, and -
- Things happen, you know, and-

1047
01:19:24,749 --> 01:19:26,649
- hey-
- That's part of life.

1048
01:19:26,751 --> 01:19:29,652
- I can't let him down no more.
- Good.

1049
01:19:29,754 --> 01:19:34,087
Okay, good.
I hope we can work something out then.

1050
01:19:34,190 --> 01:19:36,181
- I'd like to thank you.
- No problem.

1051
01:19:36,293 --> 01:19:38,093
- That's why we're here.
We try to help people.

1052
01:19:38,094 --> 01:19:38,693
- That's right.

1053
01:19:38,795 --> 01:19:40,695
- Okay? Very good.
- All right. Thank you very much.

1054
01:19:40,797 --> 01:19:42,765
- have a nice day.
- Take care now.

1055
01:19:42,866 --> 01:19:45,266
Okay. Very good.

1056
01:19:45,368 --> 01:19:47,233
- Okay.
- Okay.

1057
01:19:47,337 --> 01:19:49,271
- That's what I need.
- Yeah.

1058
01:19:52,342 --> 01:19:57,109
I think about it-had I not been on drugs
when Arthur went to St. Joseph's...

1059
01:19:57,213 --> 01:20:00,113
just how good
it would have been for him.

1060
01:20:00,215 --> 01:20:02,342
He wouldn't have had to leave.

1061
01:20:03,919 --> 01:20:06,203
Here's one of the corners right here

1062
01:20:06,204 --> 01:20:09,186
where I used to come
up and cop all the time.

1063
01:20:12,394 --> 01:20:15,363
Threw away a lot of money
on these corners, boy.

1064
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:21,169
I almost threw my life
right along with it.

1065
01:20:24,139 --> 01:20:26,039
He can just look at my life...

1066
01:20:26,141 --> 01:20:29,598
and say here's a good example
of what not to do.

1067
01:20:31,312 --> 01:20:33,212
If he had my ways...

1068
01:20:33,314 --> 01:20:36,909
I would be shakin' in my shoes
right now.

1069
01:20:46,627 --> 01:20:49,221
Hey, look at that Georgetown coat.
Man, I might get that.

1070
01:20:49,330 --> 01:20:51,696
- Dang!
- Pocket on the side.

1071
01:20:51,799 --> 01:20:54,029
That's the one I was tellin' you about.

1072
01:20:56,003 --> 01:20:57,697
How much?

1073
01:20:58,739 --> 01:21:01,401
Seventy bucks even, no tax.

1074
01:21:04,244 --> 01:21:06,644
Some of the drug pushers
in the neighborhood...

1075
01:21:06,747 --> 01:21:10,706
they'll give us money, tell us,
"Go shoppin; Go get you somethin; '"

1076
01:21:10,817 --> 01:21:14,719
They're thinkin; we playin' basketball
and they can give us stuff...

1077
01:21:14,821 --> 01:21:17,153
and keep our career goin;

1078
01:21:17,257 --> 01:21:20,385
So that's how we were to
keep up with the styles.

1079
01:21:21,928 --> 01:21:24,590
A'ight.

1080
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:43,580
While you're sitting here today...

1081
01:21:43,682 --> 01:21:45,980
you should feel like a million dollars.

1082
01:21:46,085 --> 01:21:48,383
You should feel so special.

1083
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:51,945
You are one of a hundred
of the best high school players...

1084
01:21:52,057 --> 01:21:54,787
in this country,
the United States.

1085
01:21:54,894 --> 01:21:57,794
My mother, God bless her,
she's in heaven today.

1086
01:21:57,896 --> 01:22:00,156
She used to always say
to me, "This is America.

1087
01:22:00,157 --> 01:22:01,992
You can make something of your life."

1088
01:22:05,103 --> 01:22:06,730
Come on! Come on!

1089
01:22:06,838 --> 01:22:10,137
Okay.

1090
01:22:10,241 --> 01:22:14,473
All the coaches from over here.
To the stands, please, coaches!

1091
01:22:14,579 --> 01:22:16,479
Coaches, we gotta clear!

1092
01:22:16,581 --> 01:22:19,709
If you a player, somebody up there
gonna recognize that you a player.

1093
01:22:19,818 --> 01:22:22,753
So there's 250 of us here.

1094
01:22:22,854 --> 01:22:24,551
We're doing it to try to find out who

1095
01:22:24,552 --> 01:22:26,846
the best players are and
get 'em in our program.

1096
01:22:26,957 --> 01:22:29,858
There aren't very many kids at any level,
including the NBA...

1097
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:32,724
that really understand
what basketball is all about.

1098
01:22:32,830 --> 01:22:34,502
We always say, you're
going to war, would you

1099
01:22:34,503 --> 01:22:35,993
want him behind you covering your flank?

1100
01:22:36,099 --> 01:22:39,000
If you're pouting,
they're gonna also recognize that.

1101
01:22:39,102 --> 01:22:39,845
And don't tell me

1102
01:22:39,846 --> 01:22:41,900
they're not gonna write
it down in that book.

1103
01:22:42,005 --> 01:22:43,905
At the prestigious Nike camp...

1104
01:22:44,007 --> 01:22:46,567
William hopes to prove
the injuries are behind him...

1105
01:22:46,677 --> 01:22:49,339
and he belongs
among the nation's best.

1106
01:22:59,555 --> 01:23:01,580
One, two, three.

1107
01:23:01,691 --> 01:23:03,249
Next.!

1108
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:07,819
One, two, three, four.!

1109
01:23:13,970 --> 01:23:17,770
Arthur and Shannon spend their summer
at Pizza hut earning 3.35 an hour.

1110
01:23:26,381 --> 01:23:28,281
Yeah.

1111
01:23:28,383 --> 01:23:31,443
- hello. how are you all doing today?
- Fine.

1112
01:23:47,402 --> 01:23:50,496
It's a waste of my time down here.
I'm ready to go home.

1113
01:23:51,939 --> 01:23:55,204
Here I am, always tryin'
to play this team ball.

1114
01:23:56,810 --> 01:23:59,210
A few coaches - more coaches
comin' around to look...

1115
01:23:59,313 --> 01:24:03,613
everybody feel they gotta do
they own little thing here.

1116
01:24:03,717 --> 01:24:06,185
Move it.! Move it.!

1117
01:24:06,287 --> 01:24:08,187
Stick in the post.!

1118
01:24:08,289 --> 01:24:11,258
Some of you are gonna make it
where you want to be...

1119
01:24:11,358 --> 01:24:13,485
and others of you will not make it.

1120
01:24:13,594 --> 01:24:17,621
This is summer for them.
They don't wanna be sitting in a classroom.

1121
01:24:17,731 --> 01:24:19,631
But we provide them with an experience...

1122
01:24:19,733 --> 01:24:21,825
you can't get anywhere else...

1123
01:24:21,935 --> 01:24:24,301
in that we simulate what it's going
to be like to be a student athlete.

1124
01:24:24,404 --> 01:24:27,305
Fifteen hours a week for basketball.
How many hours do we have up here?

1125
01:24:27,407 --> 01:24:29,741
The statistics on Division I players

1126
01:24:29,742 --> 01:24:32,674
graduating from college
are really frightening.

1127
01:24:32,779 --> 01:24:35,976
Let's assume you're playing
big-time college basketball...

1128
01:24:36,082 --> 01:24:38,812
and your team travels-

1129
01:24:38,918 --> 01:24:41,318
You have to realize...

1130
01:24:41,421 --> 01:24:43,753
that nobody cares about you.

1131
01:24:43,856 --> 01:24:46,950
You're black,
you're a young male.

1132
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:50,495
All you're supposed to do
is deal drugs and mug women.

1133
01:24:51,530 --> 01:24:54,658
The only reason why you're here-

1134
01:24:55,767 --> 01:24:57,667
you can make their team win.

1135
01:24:57,769 --> 01:24:59,828
If their team wins...

1136
01:24:59,938 --> 01:25:02,031
these schools get a lot of money.

1137
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:05,109
This whole thing
is revolving around money.

1138
01:25:11,049 --> 01:25:14,883
Recruiting is like
any other sales business.

1139
01:25:14,987 --> 01:25:16,887
We've gotta win to keep our jobs.

1140
01:25:16,989 --> 01:25:18,888
We've gotta fill the arena
to keep our jobs.

1141
01:25:18,990 --> 01:25:20,890
And if we don't, they fire us.

1142
01:25:20,992 --> 01:25:24,018
I mean, that's - hey, if bankers
don't make money, they fire them.

1143
01:25:24,128 --> 01:25:28,656
When you look at some of these young boys'
bodies, they got NBA bodies already.

1144
01:25:31,268 --> 01:25:34,169
There's one particular kid
who's here now...

1145
01:25:34,271 --> 01:25:37,104
I've watched him since sixth grade;
I've watched him blossom.

1146
01:25:37,208 --> 01:25:40,109
That's when you wanna get on 'em -
when they're young -

1147
01:25:40,211 --> 01:25:42,441
and start writin' 'em
before everybody else writes 'em.

1148
01:25:42,546 --> 01:25:45,947
Try to get any edge you can
in this business.

1149
01:25:47,784 --> 01:25:49,684
It's already become a meat market.

1150
01:25:49,786 --> 01:25:52,846
But I try to - to, uh, do my job...

1151
01:25:52,956 --> 01:25:56,414
you know, and serve professional me.

1152
01:26:02,332 --> 01:26:05,824
What schools do you think
are most involved with William right now?

1153
01:26:05,935 --> 01:26:07,926
I would say DePaul...

1154
01:26:08,038 --> 01:26:11,371
Marquette, Indiana, Michigan.

1155
01:26:12,475 --> 01:26:15,535
Excellent.

1156
01:26:15,645 --> 01:26:17,805
Great job! Way to go!

1157
01:26:17,913 --> 01:26:21,178
Bob Gibbons done seen me
play my best game out here.

1158
01:26:21,283 --> 01:26:24,650
Turned in 16 points, 12 assists.

1159
01:26:24,753 --> 01:26:27,051
Bob Gibbons over there like this -
"hmm."

1160
01:26:29,158 --> 01:26:31,649
Yeah, I was smilin' too, Bob.

1161
01:26:34,096 --> 01:26:36,189
Give me a slice of the crust.

1162
01:26:38,133 --> 01:26:40,033
Probably will.

1163
01:26:40,135 --> 01:26:42,365
Thanks a lot.

1164
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:46,400
Look.

1165
01:26:46,507 --> 01:26:48,134
Hey, Mom.

1166
01:26:51,379 --> 01:26:53,939
Right now I'm feelin' good about myself.

1167
01:26:58,386 --> 01:27:02,755
I really feel like, since I been down here,
that I was all-American.

1168
01:27:04,892 --> 01:27:08,055
When I go back home
I'm gonna feel unstoppable.

1169
01:27:09,731 --> 01:27:13,690
This one eyebrows up.
This one eyebrows up.

1170
01:27:14,968 --> 01:27:16,868
Swing it!

1171
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:18,938
Whoo-hoo!

1172
01:27:32,652 --> 01:27:36,053
I'm gonna pull up on it, okay?
Tell me if it hurts more.

1173
01:27:36,156 --> 01:27:39,125
- Yeah.
- It hurts more when I do that?

1174
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:49,167
Easy does it, now.

1175
01:27:53,606 --> 01:27:57,042
It's on the muscle. It's not on the joint.
It's above the joint.

1176
01:27:57,143 --> 01:27:58,872
Okay?

1177
01:28:03,449 --> 01:28:05,542
What's your name?

1178
01:28:05,651 --> 01:28:07,551
Though it's only a muscle injury...

1179
01:28:07,653 --> 01:28:10,584
it's severe enough that
William will not compete

1180
01:28:10,585 --> 01:28:12,612
for the final two days of the camp.

1181
01:28:35,413 --> 01:28:37,643
How many electives
you need to graduate?

1182
01:28:37,749 --> 01:28:39,649
- Six.
- Six?

1183
01:28:39,751 --> 01:28:42,082
Arthur's transcript
from St. Joseph's has arrived.

1184
01:28:42,186 --> 01:28:45,485
If you pass all of the classes
that you're presently taking...

1185
01:28:45,589 --> 01:28:47,921
you can graduate
from summer school.

1186
01:28:48,025 --> 01:28:50,255
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

1187
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:52,658
- have you taken the A.C.T.?
- Mm-mmm.

1188
01:28:52,763 --> 01:28:54,663
When do you plan to take it?

1189
01:28:54,765 --> 01:28:56,665
Sometime soon.

1190
01:28:56,767 --> 01:28:59,181
What institution are
you planning on going to?

1191
01:28:59,182 --> 01:29:00,362
Have you decided that?

1192
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:04,873
I was, um, thinking about,
going to, um... Alabama.

1193
01:29:04,975 --> 01:29:08,035
But you need to take
Algebra-Trig. Okay?

1194
01:29:09,112 --> 01:29:11,011
Do you plan to take that?

1195
01:29:11,113 --> 01:29:13,411
I don't know.

1196
01:29:13,516 --> 01:29:15,484
You don't know?

1197
01:29:17,186 --> 01:29:20,087
So you just barely gettin' by again.

1198
01:29:22,191 --> 01:29:24,284
No. You ain't gotta say that.

1199
01:29:24,393 --> 01:29:26,918
But you are.
You've been barely gettin' by all along.

1200
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:29,930
Now, you gonna have to do better than that
if you wanna go to Alabama...

1201
01:29:30,032 --> 01:29:32,432
or any other school.

1202
01:29:32,535 --> 01:29:35,663
You gonna have to do more
than just get by.

1203
01:29:36,906 --> 01:29:39,373
Don't forget to bring
those papers back to me.

1204
01:29:39,474 --> 01:29:41,374
- Okay.
- All right.

1205
01:29:43,445 --> 01:29:46,778
St. Joe's just messed everything up.
Shouldn't have even went there.

1206
01:29:48,350 --> 01:29:50,250
Thought I had more credits than this.

1207
01:29:50,352 --> 01:29:53,685
They goin' kick me out
'cause I ain't payin' 'em money. Man!

1208
01:29:56,391 --> 01:29:59,360
That's all right, though.
I'm gonna still make it.

1209
01:30:04,266 --> 01:30:07,497
"Don't let your best
opportunity get away from you.

1210
01:30:07,602 --> 01:30:11,765
"You can have a great experience
at Marquette University.

1211
01:30:11,872 --> 01:30:13,772
"Once you visit our campus...

1212
01:30:13,874 --> 01:30:18,538
"I feel confident that you will know
that Marquette is the right place for you.

1213
01:30:18,646 --> 01:30:21,137
Sincerely, Kevin O'Neill."

1214
01:30:24,818 --> 01:30:26,877
I like these.

1215
01:30:26,987 --> 01:30:30,923
I been gettin; like, two a week
from the school for...

1216
01:30:32,126 --> 01:30:34,026
a couple of months.

1217
01:30:34,128 --> 01:30:36,289
So that's quite a few.

1218
01:30:36,397 --> 01:30:40,628
I know you're game,
but, Monica, you seem very overwrought.

1219
01:30:42,802 --> 01:30:45,327
I had Division I offers.

1220
01:30:45,438 --> 01:30:47,067
I had even signed at Marquette

1221
01:30:47,068 --> 01:30:49,534
'cause they thought I
was gonna make the grades.

1222
01:30:52,278 --> 01:30:54,439
The great ballplayers...

1223
01:30:54,547 --> 01:30:57,448
they care about basketball
more than they care about school...

1224
01:30:57,550 --> 01:30:59,882
and I know they do.

1225
01:31:10,062 --> 01:31:12,030
Shaky. Shaky.

1226
01:31:15,901 --> 01:31:18,893
Ohh.!

1227
01:31:19,004 --> 01:31:20,904
Let me try somethin;!

1228
01:31:21,106 --> 01:31:24,837
If you're looking for
a progressive college basketball program...

1229
01:31:24,943 --> 01:31:28,003
with experienced leadership
and a winning tradition...

1230
01:31:28,113 --> 01:31:31,480
then the Marquette Warriors
are for you.

1231
01:31:31,583 --> 01:31:34,484
William's first home recruiting visit.

1232
01:31:34,586 --> 01:31:36,519
Three top schools postpone visits...

1233
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:39,535
preferring to wait and
see how William will do

1234
01:31:39,536 --> 01:31:41,284
his senior year at St. Joe's.

1235
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:45,120
If you don't make the test score,
it doesn't mean we don't want you...

1236
01:31:45,229 --> 01:31:47,129
because we still do-
that's what I'm telling you.

1237
01:31:47,231 --> 01:31:49,131
If you tear your knee out
again this year...

1238
01:31:49,233 --> 01:31:51,133
and you can't
play ever again...

1239
01:31:51,235 --> 01:31:53,601
you're gonna have your education
paid for at Marquette University.

1240
01:31:53,704 --> 01:31:56,537
I know that the scholarship
is one-year renewable.

1241
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:58,642
Gene's right about this,
but any school worth

1242
01:31:58,655 --> 01:32:00,667
its salt is gonna
give you four years.

1243
01:32:00,778 --> 01:32:03,804
The bottom line is this-
we want to win the national title.

1244
01:32:03,914 --> 01:32:06,609
Number two-I wanna make you
the best player I can.

1245
01:32:06,716 --> 01:32:09,617
I wanna give you an opportunity
to, maybe someday...

1246
01:32:09,719 --> 01:32:12,847
be one of those guys that makes
some money in Europe or in the NBA.

1247
01:32:12,956 --> 01:32:16,448
You're one of seven guys
that we're recruiting right now.

1248
01:32:16,559 --> 01:32:19,528
- You're recruiting seven guys?
- Seven guys for three spots.

1249
01:32:21,197 --> 01:32:23,097
Where he fit in?

1250
01:32:23,199 --> 01:32:25,099
- Where does he fit in?
- Yeah.

1251
01:32:25,201 --> 01:32:27,761
As soon as William tells me
he's not looking at any other schools...

1252
01:32:27,871 --> 01:32:29,736
then I'm not looking at
any other players.

1253
01:32:29,839 --> 01:32:32,239
So, what?
The first one sign, that's -

1254
01:32:32,342 --> 01:32:35,538
Well-Well, that's what
it's gonna come down to.

1255
01:32:35,644 --> 01:32:38,545
If I tell you that, hey,
you're our guy and this and that...

1256
01:32:38,647 --> 01:32:41,548
and I lose you to Kansas, Indiana,
North Carolina State or something...

1257
01:32:41,650 --> 01:32:43,550
I'm out of luck.

1258
01:32:43,652 --> 01:32:46,382
The president's saying to me,
"I thought you were recruiting a guard. '"

1259
01:32:46,488 --> 01:32:49,423
It's a tough situation,
but it's something that has to be done.

1260
01:33:09,744 --> 01:33:11,644
It's a great place.

1261
01:33:11,746 --> 01:33:13,737
We're gettin' ready
to have it rockin;

1262
01:33:14,849 --> 01:33:17,716
The best is yet to come.

1263
01:33:20,088 --> 01:33:23,080
Lot of serious ballplayers
been through this building-

1264
01:33:23,191 --> 01:33:27,855
Junior Bridgeman, Sidney Moncrief,
Bob Lanier, Oscar Robertson.

1265
01:33:29,797 --> 01:33:33,789
Can you see yourself playing
in this place here, 18,000 in it?

1266
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:37,097
Big difference from St. Joe's, now.

1267
01:33:41,241 --> 01:33:43,141
We stayed at the hyatt.

1268
01:33:43,243 --> 01:33:46,542
Man, it was nice. Real nice.

1269
01:33:46,646 --> 01:33:50,173
They had these balloons
all hangin' up on the ceiling, everything.

1270
01:33:50,283 --> 01:33:52,911
They-They really did it up.

1271
01:33:53,019 --> 01:33:55,613
And I must say, we did it up too.

1272
01:33:55,722 --> 01:34:00,920
We - Room service.
Man!

1273
01:34:01,026 --> 01:34:04,052
Had these phony newspapers written up.

1274
01:34:04,163 --> 01:34:07,291
Notre Dame 77, Marquette 76.

1275
01:34:07,399 --> 01:34:11,495
Gates is out high, calling for the ball.!
There are six seconds left.

1276
01:34:11,604 --> 01:34:15,096
The freshman spins past the defender,
slicing to his left to the foul line.

1277
01:34:15,207 --> 01:34:17,937
Three seconds left.
Marquette down by one.

1278
01:34:18,043 --> 01:34:20,841
Gates launches a running one-hander.!
It's on the way.!

1279
01:34:20,946 --> 01:34:23,938
It is good.!

1280
01:34:24,049 --> 01:34:29,042
Gates buries a 13-footer
just ahead of the horn...

1281
01:34:29,154 --> 01:34:32,749
and Marquette
has defeated Notre Dame.!

1282
01:34:32,857 --> 01:34:35,587
If you think we care about you
a lot in recruiting...

1283
01:34:35,693 --> 01:34:37,854
we're gonna do more
when you're here.

1284
01:34:37,962 --> 01:34:39,726
Don't let it get to a
point where somebody else

1285
01:34:39,727 --> 01:34:41,159
comes in and takes a scholarship away.

1286
01:34:42,567 --> 01:34:46,469
Let us know what you wanna do-unless
you know what you wanna do right now.

1287
01:34:46,571 --> 01:34:49,540
He knows, but he won't say.

1288
01:34:55,847 --> 01:34:58,679
You talked to any, uh...

1289
01:34:58,782 --> 01:35:01,683
leading black people on the campus?

1290
01:35:01,785 --> 01:35:03,685
- The leading black people?
- Yeah.

1291
01:35:03,787 --> 01:35:05,687
- Such as?
- Whoever might be in charge...

1292
01:35:05,789 --> 01:35:07,689
of all the black students on campus -

1293
01:35:07,791 --> 01:35:10,692
what kind of community life
they have for the blacks there.

1294
01:35:10,794 --> 01:35:12,694
- Uh -
- Did you talk to anyone about it?

1295
01:35:12,796 --> 01:35:14,420
- Did you ask the players
how they're treated?

1296
01:35:14,421 --> 01:35:14,696
- Yeah.

1297
01:35:14,798 --> 01:35:16,698
- What'd they say?
- Players say they treated fine.

1298
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,030
I mean, they get
the best of everything.

1299
01:35:19,136 --> 01:35:21,036
- You think that's where you wanna go?
- Yeah.

1300
01:35:21,138 --> 01:35:22,901
That's fine.

1301
01:35:23,006 --> 01:35:24,608
Obviously, if you wait you'll have

1302
01:35:24,609 --> 01:35:26,964
all the other schools
that were on you before...

1303
01:35:27,076 --> 01:35:31,069
like Kansas and Indiana
and North Carolina State.

1304
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:33,410
That's all right, uh, but...

1305
01:35:33,516 --> 01:35:35,416
I discussed it with -

1306
01:35:35,518 --> 01:35:37,486
I think you should take a few days.

1307
01:35:38,754 --> 01:35:41,416
Because you just came back.
You understand?

1308
01:35:43,192 --> 01:35:45,092
- Poop!
- Yeah!

1309
01:35:45,194 --> 01:35:47,389
Yea!

1310
01:35:47,496 --> 01:35:49,396
Boo!

1311
01:35:52,034 --> 01:35:54,093
Is there any cash with this?

1312
01:35:54,203 --> 01:35:56,102
Uh, it's in the mail.

1313
01:35:56,204 --> 01:35:59,002
To four years of excellence.

1314
01:35:59,107 --> 01:36:01,735
- hear! hear!
- Hear! hear!

1315
01:36:06,081 --> 01:36:08,447
- It's alcohol-free.
- It's not that bad.

1316
01:36:16,925 --> 01:36:20,588
I am fixing him
a birthday dinner today.

1317
01:36:20,695 --> 01:36:22,595
It's his 18th birthday...

1318
01:36:22,697 --> 01:36:26,427
and I want to show him
how much we appreciate him and love him...

1319
01:36:26,533 --> 01:36:28,501
and care for him.

1320
01:36:30,070 --> 01:36:33,198
Everything that you can imagine
was going wrong with this family...

1321
01:36:33,307 --> 01:36:36,037
but now everybody's together.

1322
01:36:36,143 --> 01:36:38,441
It's his favorite cake.

1323
01:36:38,545 --> 01:36:40,740
He's a great kid.

1324
01:36:40,848 --> 01:36:44,306
And some kids don't live
to get this age, you know.

1325
01:36:44,418 --> 01:36:47,649
That's another thing
to be proud about -

1326
01:36:47,755 --> 01:36:50,883
that, you know,
it's his 18th birthday, he lived...

1327
01:36:50,991 --> 01:36:54,756
and to get to see 18, that's good.

1328
01:36:58,498 --> 01:37:02,059
I wanna tell you that I love you very much.
I'm very proud of you.

1329
01:37:02,168 --> 01:37:06,537
It seems like I was 18 just yesterday.
Here. happy birthday. I love you.

1330
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:08,539
- Ohh.!
- Hey-hey.!

1331
01:37:08,641 --> 01:37:10,541
- happy birthday!
- I love you too.!

1332
01:37:10,643 --> 01:37:13,908
- Come over here.
- Where you goin', homes?

1333
01:37:14,013 --> 01:37:16,208
Where you goin', homes?

1334
01:37:24,823 --> 01:37:26,723
Blow out the candles.!

1335
01:37:28,827 --> 01:37:31,227
Two months after his 18th birthday...

1336
01:37:31,330 --> 01:37:33,696
Arthur is cut off public aid.

1337
01:37:34,733 --> 01:37:36,633
This is what I brought to their attention.

1338
01:37:36,735 --> 01:37:39,033
He's still a full-time student.
He hasn't graduated yet.

1339
01:37:39,137 --> 01:37:41,537
So why would you-all cut him off?

1340
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:43,540
- I'll bite you!
- I'll bite you back.

1341
01:37:43,642 --> 01:37:45,542
They feel like when they get 18...

1342
01:37:45,644 --> 01:37:48,044
most the black kids
they drop out.

1343
01:37:48,146 --> 01:37:51,604
So that means that the child
is just thrown out there.

1344
01:37:53,784 --> 01:37:57,743
I was gettin' 368.
Now I get 268.

1345
01:37:59,990 --> 01:38:02,083
And that's it.

1346
01:38:02,193 --> 01:38:05,651
And that's to take care of me
from one month to the next.

1347
01:38:08,032 --> 01:38:10,432
Now, can you imagine
a person living on that?

1348
01:38:10,534 --> 01:38:13,503
Do you-all wonder sometime,
how am I livin'?

1349
01:38:14,772 --> 01:38:18,708
Or how do my children survive,
or how they livin'?

1350
01:38:19,977 --> 01:38:24,936
It's enough to make people really wanna go
out there and lash out and hurt somebody.

1351
01:38:26,816 --> 01:38:29,410
A message to the Oreo cookie.

1352
01:38:29,519 --> 01:38:33,216
No matter how much you wanna switch,
here's what they think about you:

1353
01:38:33,323 --> 01:38:37,919
Fried chicken
and biscuit-eatin' monkey, ape, baboon...

1354
01:38:38,027 --> 01:38:41,190
big-thighed, fast-runnin;
high-jumpin; spear-chuckin;..

1355
01:38:41,297 --> 01:38:44,755
360-degree basketball-dunkin;..

1356
01:38:44,868 --> 01:38:47,098
Pit-swingin' spade moulanyan.

1357
01:38:47,203 --> 01:38:50,638
Go the fuck back to Africa.
Go the fuck back to Africa.

1358
01:38:50,739 --> 01:38:52,639
Go the fuck back to Africa.

1359
01:38:52,741 --> 01:38:54,641
Think about it. Fuckin' sellout.

1360
01:38:56,678 --> 01:38:58,805
Play the music, motherfucker!
Put the music on!

1361
01:39:09,057 --> 01:39:10,615
Shoot it.

1362
01:39:10,726 --> 01:39:14,822
Rebound.! Go, go, go.!

1363
01:39:19,634 --> 01:39:21,602
Gates stinks.

1364
01:39:21,702 --> 01:39:24,364
You got that? he stinks.

1365
01:39:27,375 --> 01:39:30,606
He doesn't play with confidence,
like he did before he was injured.

1366
01:39:36,083 --> 01:39:38,779
I don't believe the other players
have complete confidence in William.

1367
01:39:40,521 --> 01:39:43,319
They were in awe of William
when he was a sophomore.

1368
01:39:43,424 --> 01:39:45,722
They're not in awe of him anymore.

1369
01:40:08,181 --> 01:40:10,081
Sophomore year...

1370
01:40:10,183 --> 01:40:12,378
I was just carefree.

1371
01:40:15,222 --> 01:40:18,054
If it could be done,
I was gonna do it.

1372
01:40:19,091 --> 01:40:22,151
I wish I could
get that attitude back.

1373
01:40:28,267 --> 01:40:29,734
Go.!

1374
01:40:31,136 --> 01:40:33,195
Hold up.!
That's crap.!

1375
01:40:33,305 --> 01:40:35,773
That is dog-shit crap.!

1376
01:40:36,809 --> 01:40:39,505
Why did you have to
do something unnecessarily?

1377
01:40:39,612 --> 01:40:43,844
If you would've kept it over here, William
- Look at me!

1378
01:40:43,949 --> 01:40:48,351
If you had kept it over here, wide,
you could have gone all the way.

1379
01:40:48,453 --> 01:40:51,911
What is that crap,
the shovel pass?

1380
01:40:53,358 --> 01:40:55,758
There was never any point in our school...

1381
01:40:55,860 --> 01:41:00,388
where we just-
just played outright, you know.

1382
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:05,961
Now, remember, think about the ball game
on the way to the game.

1383
01:41:21,718 --> 01:41:23,447
I'll bet a nickel.

1384
01:41:23,554 --> 01:41:25,351
If I got a nickel.

1385
01:41:25,455 --> 01:41:27,685
Yeah, I got it!

1386
01:41:27,791 --> 01:41:29,691
Marshall began its season well...

1387
01:41:29,793 --> 01:41:31,693
winning four of six.

1388
01:41:31,795 --> 01:41:34,628
Today's game will be their first
against a city power.

1389
01:41:35,666 --> 01:41:38,931
The only way you gonna beat them
is to play good basketball.

1390
01:41:39,036 --> 01:41:41,436
All that bullshit that you be playin' -

1391
01:41:41,538 --> 01:41:44,700
You play half of a game, for two
or three minutes you play pretty good...

1392
01:41:44,807 --> 01:41:46,707
then you go to sleep.

1393
01:41:46,809 --> 01:41:49,277
You have to play a whole ball game.

1394
01:41:54,784 --> 01:41:58,242
When we start out,
Arthur will be completely in the ball game.

1395
01:42:00,523 --> 01:42:04,186
But as the game progresses,
then he digresses.

1396
01:42:17,272 --> 01:42:22,005
By halftime, Marshall trails
highly favored Dunbar by 15 points.

1397
01:42:33,221 --> 01:42:35,121
But late in the fourth quarter...

1398
01:42:35,223 --> 01:42:37,453
Arthur and the Commandos
claw their way back.

1399
01:42:40,028 --> 01:42:41,927
On a crucial possession...

1400
01:42:42,029 --> 01:42:43,997
the ball goes to Arthur.

1401
01:42:56,010 --> 01:42:57,978
Hey, boy!
Gimme some, boy!

1402
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:01,907
Hey, Arthur G!

1403
01:43:03,317 --> 01:43:07,651
Hey, Arthur G! You ever got rich,
they'd catch you for sure! Come here, dog!

1404
01:43:09,757 --> 01:43:11,656
That's it, man.!
Showin' your beef!

1405
01:43:11,758 --> 01:43:14,454
I want it up high, G.
I want it up high.

1406
01:43:24,570 --> 01:43:27,471
Led by William's 16 points a game...

1407
01:43:27,573 --> 01:43:29,905
the Chargers have a 20 and 3 record.

1408
01:43:30,009 --> 01:43:32,944
But Coach Pingatore feels they're not ready
for the impending play-offs.

1409
01:43:33,046 --> 01:43:35,947
Alabama.! Alabama.!

1410
01:43:36,049 --> 01:43:37,812
Alabama.!

1411
01:43:46,291 --> 01:43:48,953
Well, don't throw the ball!

1412
01:43:49,061 --> 01:43:52,189
Jesus, will you cut it out
and quit acting like a baby!

1413
01:43:52,297 --> 01:43:54,265
Will you quit cryin'!

1414
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:58,064
This team just drives me crazy.

1415
01:43:59,171 --> 01:44:01,332
It's been a struggle all year.

1416
01:44:02,474 --> 01:44:04,374
You think you're better than you are.

1417
01:44:04,476 --> 01:44:06,603
The two big guys are prima donnas.

1418
01:44:06,712 --> 01:44:09,475
They should be killin' people.

1419
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:12,481
For you people
that are really agonizing...

1420
01:44:12,583 --> 01:44:16,485
and just hate all this stuff
and all the hollering...

1421
01:44:16,587 --> 01:44:19,613
if you don't make a turn,
it'll be over next week...

1422
01:44:19,724 --> 01:44:21,692
so you won't have to worry about it.

1423
01:44:21,792 --> 01:44:24,124
That's the point.

1424
01:44:26,897 --> 01:44:29,832
I wanna end this game
in the next three to four minutes.

1425
01:44:29,934 --> 01:44:32,903
Otherwise it's gonna be a ball game.
All right, let's go get 'em. Come on.

1426
01:44:33,003 --> 01:44:34,903
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1427
01:44:35,005 --> 01:44:36,905
Blessed art thou -

1428
01:44:37,007 --> 01:44:38,022
holy Mary, Mother of
God, pray for us sinners

1429
01:44:38,023 --> 01:44:38,906
now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

1430
01:44:39,008 --> 01:44:40,908
All right, let's go.
Come on.

1431
01:44:42,645 --> 01:44:45,045
William's just too nice of a kid.

1432
01:44:45,148 --> 01:44:47,275
I don't know if he has
the killer temperament.

1433
01:44:47,383 --> 01:44:49,851
I don't know if he has
the eye of the tiger.

1434
01:44:49,953 --> 01:44:52,478
He's gonna need that
when he goes to the next level.

1435
01:44:52,589 --> 01:44:54,557
Remember, square up!

1436
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:59,194
It's business, it's big bucks...

1437
01:44:59,295 --> 01:45:01,195
and that's what the scholarship's for.

1438
01:45:01,297 --> 01:45:03,197
Good job.

1439
01:45:23,118 --> 01:45:25,518
- his coach is stingy and selfish.
- My coach is not -

1440
01:45:25,621 --> 01:45:28,021
he just want William
to run out there and play-

1441
01:45:28,123 --> 01:45:30,455
- My coach is not stingy and selfish.
- Yes, he is!

1442
01:45:30,559 --> 01:45:33,960
The day she was gonna be born
I told him he had to be there.

1443
01:45:34,062 --> 01:45:36,962
I don't care what his coach say.
I know the game was important.

1444
01:45:37,064 --> 01:45:41,728
But this was more important,
and his coach doesn't see it like that.

1445
01:45:41,836 --> 01:45:43,736
I just can't miss a game...

1446
01:45:43,838 --> 01:45:46,739
just because, you know,
an incident occur...

1447
01:45:46,841 --> 01:45:49,332
unless it was like a death
or somethin' like that.

1448
01:45:49,443 --> 01:45:53,209
This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.
Ain't like the girl was born every day.

1449
01:45:53,314 --> 01:45:56,715
That's what I was tryin' to get you to say.

1450
01:45:56,818 --> 01:45:59,878
Especially around that time
of the year too - state tournament.

1451
01:45:59,987 --> 01:46:02,455
It was simply out of the question.

1452
01:46:03,558 --> 01:46:06,685
He tells me,
"Well, it'll benefit us in the future. '"

1453
01:46:06,793 --> 01:46:08,693
I'm, like, "But what about now?"

1454
01:46:08,795 --> 01:46:10,695
he keeps sayin' in the fu -

1455
01:46:10,797 --> 01:46:13,231
Basketball was my ticket
out of the ghetto.

1456
01:46:13,333 --> 01:46:16,234
If I wouldn't have been playin' ball,
I would not even be goin' to college.

1457
01:46:16,336 --> 01:46:17,854
I'm goin' to college,
and I have a daughter.

1458
01:46:17,867 --> 01:46:19,396
So what's
my excuse?

1459
01:46:19,506 --> 01:46:20,558
Because the situations
are much different.

1460
01:46:20,571 --> 01:46:21,633
No, it's not.

1461
01:46:54,039 --> 01:46:57,133
I haven't been workin' for about a year.

1462
01:47:00,846 --> 01:47:04,144
And if it wasn't for William
knowing Miss Wier...

1463
01:47:04,249 --> 01:47:06,149
I wouldn't even be here.

1464
01:47:06,251 --> 01:47:08,128
'Cause I walked in the door and that's

1465
01:47:08,129 --> 01:47:10,745
the first thing I see on the sign
- "No openings."

1466
01:47:10,855 --> 01:47:15,258
It ain't much better than a person
without a college degree can get.

1467
01:47:17,161 --> 01:47:20,460
So I feel like I'll be here
for quite a while.

1468
01:47:32,743 --> 01:47:34,973
What you lookin' at?

1469
01:47:35,078 --> 01:47:39,310
I don't believe people
when they be sayin; "Wow, school's hard.!'"

1470
01:47:39,416 --> 01:47:41,907
The work weren't hard for me.

1471
01:47:42,019 --> 01:47:44,579
All right. I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it.

1472
01:47:44,688 --> 01:47:47,589
If I gotta do, like,
a report or somethin;..

1473
01:47:47,691 --> 01:47:51,525
I don't like none of the topics,
so I'll just pick somethin' that's simple.

1474
01:47:54,531 --> 01:47:56,795
So, what's the topic of your paper?

1475
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:59,232
The life cycle of the butterfly.

1476
01:47:59,336 --> 01:48:02,236
- Gonna read it for us?
- Mm-mmm.

1477
01:48:02,338 --> 01:48:04,238
Aw, come on.!

1478
01:48:04,340 --> 01:48:06,240
No, man!

1479
01:48:06,342 --> 01:48:09,175
- I wanna hear it-
- I'm just doin' this stuff!

1480
01:48:09,278 --> 01:48:11,838
I know, but I just wanna hear
how you write.

1481
01:48:11,948 --> 01:48:14,348
"Well, as the people bloom
into another year-"

1482
01:48:14,450 --> 01:48:17,044
You know, the year just changed,
January 1.

1483
01:48:17,153 --> 01:48:19,053
"The butterfly also blooms.

1484
01:48:19,155 --> 01:48:21,555
The butterfly are very beautiful
flying objects."

1485
01:48:21,657 --> 01:48:23,858
Then it say at the
beginning of the butterfly,

1486
01:48:23,859 --> 01:48:25,684
it goes through a change and all that.

1487
01:48:25,795 --> 01:48:28,696
Then I keep goin', man.
I just wanna, like, do that stuff.

1488
01:48:28,798 --> 01:48:31,698
Then I'll just keep goin'
on and on and on...

1489
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:33,768
and I won't never stop.

1490
01:48:35,170 --> 01:48:37,934
Move out the way! Move!
Look out! Move out the way!

1491
01:48:40,208 --> 01:48:42,938
Its botanical name is Cannabis sativa.

1492
01:48:44,546 --> 01:48:47,674
Millions of Americans
break the law and use it.

1493
01:48:47,782 --> 01:48:49,682
Arthur's latest report card shows...

1494
01:48:49,784 --> 01:48:52,446
he's failing
both Spanish and Science.

1495
01:48:53,488 --> 01:48:55,388
He rushes through his work.

1496
01:48:55,490 --> 01:48:57,981
As you see,
he just missed one assignment.

1497
01:48:58,093 --> 01:48:59,992
Mm-hmm.

1498
01:49:00,094 --> 01:49:01,994
But his test scores were pretty low.

1499
01:49:02,096 --> 01:49:04,587
- he had a 10 on one test.
- Mmm-mm-mmm.

1500
01:49:04,698 --> 01:49:06,598
Will you do me a favor?

1501
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:10,602
When you see things are slippin' like this,
give me a call and let me know.

1502
01:49:10,704 --> 01:49:13,104
Let me make sure I have
the right phone number.

1503
01:49:13,207 --> 01:49:15,107
So I can stay up on top of this boy.

1504
01:49:15,209 --> 01:49:17,109
Because he tells you one thing -

1505
01:49:17,211 --> 01:49:20,612
I say, "Where your book?" "We didn't have
to work on the book. It's in my locker."

1506
01:49:20,714 --> 01:49:23,342
he gonna have to start
showin' me somethin' better.

1507
01:49:26,286 --> 01:49:27,194
He probably on the borderline,

1508
01:49:27,195 --> 01:49:28,651
and all that clownin',
people just give him an "F."

1509
01:49:28,755 --> 01:49:30,655
That's what I would do too.

1510
01:49:30,757 --> 01:49:33,658
But I'm goin' stay up on his behind
this time around.

1511
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:37,161
'Cause I told him we payin' 181-odd dollars
out there to St. Joseph's...

1512
01:49:37,263 --> 01:49:39,163
Right.

1513
01:49:39,265 --> 01:49:40,664
For his transcripts.

1514
01:49:40,767 --> 01:49:43,038
He got the transcripts
and he ain't doin' that?

1515
01:49:43,039 --> 01:49:44,931
Uh-uh. It ain't gonna happen like that.

1516
01:49:51,344 --> 01:49:53,244
Man.!

1517
01:49:53,346 --> 01:49:56,076
You remember I told you,
whatever I start I finish.

1518
01:49:57,182 --> 01:50:00,481
I'm not like some people I know.

1519
01:50:00,585 --> 01:50:02,849
I don't need nobody to push me.

1520
01:50:03,889 --> 01:50:07,950
All I gotta do is have the goal
and the motivation, and I'm ready.

1521
01:50:08,060 --> 01:50:10,358
It's Sheila's graduation day...

1522
01:50:10,462 --> 01:50:13,363
from a nurse's assistants class
at a local community center.

1523
01:50:13,465 --> 01:50:16,366
A high grade
will assure her certification.

1524
01:50:16,468 --> 01:50:19,096
I want to be an R.N. nurse.

1525
01:50:19,204 --> 01:50:21,263
I've always had that dream.

1526
01:50:23,909 --> 01:50:26,172
Well, Miss Agee.

1527
01:50:33,684 --> 01:50:35,584
- Sheila.
- Hmm?

1528
01:50:35,686 --> 01:50:39,122
You scored 89 on the exam.

1529
01:50:39,223 --> 01:50:43,125
You're gonna get the highest
grade point average for the class.

1530
01:50:43,227 --> 01:50:45,627
Really? Really?

1531
01:50:45,729 --> 01:50:47,697
No, no, no, no!

1532
01:50:49,667 --> 01:50:52,500
Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you!

1533
01:50:52,603 --> 01:50:55,070
Oh, I'm so happy!

1534
01:50:55,171 --> 01:50:57,401
Oh, thank you, Miss Martin!

1535
01:50:57,507 --> 01:50:59,407
You did it yourself.

1536
01:50:59,509 --> 01:51:02,410
Oh, thank you.

1537
01:51:02,512 --> 01:51:04,673
Oh, you so good.

1538
01:51:11,287 --> 01:51:13,847
I didn't think I could do it.

1539
01:51:13,957 --> 01:51:16,721
- I knew you could do it.
- Yeah, you did.

1540
01:51:16,826 --> 01:51:19,021
You gave me that belief in myself.

1541
01:51:20,230 --> 01:51:22,960
You're really inspiring me to go on.

1542
01:51:24,299 --> 01:51:26,927
Not just stop right here,
but go farther.

1543
01:51:27,970 --> 01:51:30,871
And people told me
I wasn't goin' be anything.

1544
01:52:28,595 --> 01:52:33,157
The gym is packed for today's
game against West Side rival, Westinghouse.

1545
01:52:36,436 --> 01:52:40,031
Marshall's rebounded
from last year's dismal 9 and 16 record...

1546
01:52:40,140 --> 01:52:42,108
to go 16 and six.

1547
01:52:44,344 --> 01:52:49,213
And Arthur has emerged as the Commandos'
second-leading scorer and assist man.

1548
01:52:53,052 --> 01:52:55,418
Rebound.!

1549
01:52:56,589 --> 01:52:59,558
Some junior colleges have begun to notice.

1550
01:52:59,658 --> 01:53:03,219
A lot of these kids won't talk
to a junior college...

1551
01:53:03,329 --> 01:53:05,889
really until after they've seen
the dream of, you know...

1552
01:53:05,998 --> 01:53:09,365
Illinois and Nevada, Las Vegas
and Georgetown kind of fade.

1553
01:53:12,071 --> 01:53:14,904
A junior college could
be Arthur's only hope.

1554
01:53:15,007 --> 01:53:17,908
Without better grades
and an 18 on the A.C. T...

1555
01:53:18,010 --> 01:53:20,705
major colleges can't offer him
a scholarship.

1556
01:53:20,812 --> 01:53:23,337
It's just too bad
those kids don't realize...

1557
01:53:23,448 --> 01:53:27,043
hey, if they had an 18,
the door is so much wider open.

1558
01:53:27,151 --> 01:53:30,678
You're in the middle.!

1559
01:53:34,158 --> 01:53:36,242
In the fourth quarter, the Commandos

1560
01:53:36,243 --> 01:53:38,754
fight back from an
11-point halftime deficit.

1561
01:53:38,863 --> 01:53:41,058
They trail by one.

1562
01:53:42,267 --> 01:53:44,827
We gotta play more aggressive on defense.
We're not good at playin' on defense.

1563
01:53:44,936 --> 01:53:46,130
Yeah, man.

1564
01:53:48,573 --> 01:53:50,267
Defense!

1565
01:54:01,118 --> 01:54:05,248
Derrick Zinneman's layup
pushes Marshall to a one-point lead.

1566
01:54:06,823 --> 01:54:09,348
Moments later,
a Westinghouse foul...

1567
01:54:09,459 --> 01:54:11,773
and then a double technical puts Arthur

1568
01:54:11,774 --> 01:54:14,362
on the line with a
chance to ice the victory.

1569
01:54:32,948 --> 01:54:35,781
One more! Whoo!

1570
01:54:44,860 --> 01:54:49,296
The upset win is sweet vindication
for the unranked Commandos.

1571
01:55:10,418 --> 01:55:13,512
- Arthur Agee, you lead the books.
- Junior!

1572
01:55:13,621 --> 01:55:16,680
You got seven.

1573
01:55:16,790 --> 01:55:20,521
Seven turnovers.
Even for the guards, that's too many.

1574
01:55:22,029 --> 01:55:26,227
This is a good win for you,
but it doesn't mean anything.

1575
01:55:26,333 --> 01:55:28,392
You gotta do better than that, man.

1576
01:55:28,502 --> 01:55:30,436
You have to do better than that.

1577
01:55:30,537 --> 01:55:32,437
Yeah, man.
That was a good game though.

1578
01:55:32,539 --> 01:55:34,507
You could have played better though,
you know.

1579
01:55:34,608 --> 01:55:37,475
Oh, Mom. You know he did good.
You’re just killing me.

1580
01:55:37,578 --> 01:55:39,978
You know your mother's proud of you.

1581
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:43,049
He been gettin' down.

1582
01:55:43,150 --> 01:55:46,277
Like a real star.

1583
01:55:48,788 --> 01:55:50,449
Number 11...

1584
01:55:50,556 --> 01:55:54,515
Arthur Agee.!

1585
01:55:57,263 --> 01:55:58,316
Nearly four years

1586
01:55:58,317 --> 01:56:00,790
after discovering Arthur
on the playground...

1587
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:04,893
Earl Smith shows up to see Arthur win
his first play-off game.

1588
01:56:05,004 --> 01:56:10,601
I figured this game and the next game
may be his last high school ball game.

1589
01:56:13,079 --> 01:56:15,103
- Where you been, man?
- Where I been?

1590
01:56:15,213 --> 01:56:17,113
- Yeah. Where you been?
- I've been workin'.

1591
01:56:17,215 --> 01:56:19,513
- Oh, yeah, right.
- I've been following you in the paper.

1592
01:56:19,618 --> 01:56:22,883
- Oh, yeah. You impressed or somethin'?
- Yeah. I'm impressed. I'm here, ain't I?

1593
01:56:22,988 --> 01:56:24,694
If I wasn't, I wouldn't
have followed you.

1594
01:56:24,707 --> 01:56:26,424
You been
talking to Ping?

1595
01:56:26,525 --> 01:56:28,755
- For what?
- You don't talk to him no more?

1596
01:56:28,860 --> 01:56:31,385
- Why not?
- What do I have to talk to him about?

1597
01:56:31,496 --> 01:56:33,396
- Well, Jamal -
- You ain't there.

1598
01:56:33,498 --> 01:56:36,934
- Yeah, you're right. I had to break out.
- Yeah.

1599
01:56:37,969 --> 01:56:42,871
So I was thinkin' about goin' tonight
to see, uh, St. Joe and Nazareth play...

1600
01:56:42,973 --> 01:56:46,670
but I wasn't sure
if you had time to do it.

1601
01:56:48,145 --> 01:56:50,113
Yeah.

1602
01:56:51,449 --> 01:56:55,078
I've got a bitter taste in my mouth
about a lot of things that happened.

1603
01:56:55,186 --> 01:56:59,213
A lot of people accuse me
of taking youngsters...

1604
01:56:59,323 --> 01:57:01,985
out of the inner city and taking them out
to St. Joe high School...

1605
01:57:02,092 --> 01:57:04,686
and they ask
what did I get out of the deal and...

1606
01:57:04,795 --> 01:57:09,255
a lot of racial slurs and so forth from
my own people about me, about what I did.

1607
01:57:09,366 --> 01:57:13,392
I still felt and feel
that I was doing the right thing...

1608
01:57:13,503 --> 01:57:15,562
for that particular time.

1609
01:57:15,672 --> 01:57:19,039
Uh, sometimes I have second thoughts...

1610
01:57:19,142 --> 01:57:22,077
when I see the net results
of what happened with the youngsters.

1611
01:57:46,602 --> 01:57:48,661
Arthur.

1612
01:57:48,770 --> 01:57:50,795
- Arthur-
- Arthur Agee, sophomore.

1613
01:57:50,906 --> 01:57:52,806
My gosh. What are you doin'?

1614
01:57:52,908 --> 01:57:54,842
- What are you doin' now?
- Goin' to school.

1615
01:57:54,943 --> 01:57:56,843
- Where?
- Marshall.

1616
01:57:56,945 --> 01:58:00,108
Oh, I taught him.
Can you believe it?

1617
01:58:00,215 --> 01:58:03,177
- So you came in case you
have to play St. Joe's?

1618
01:58:03,178 --> 01:58:03,651
- Yeah.

1619
01:58:03,752 --> 01:58:05,982
Arthur. Arthur.

1620
01:58:10,258 --> 01:58:12,158
- What's up, man?
- What's up, man?

1621
01:58:12,260 --> 01:58:14,469
- What you been up to?
You playing basketball?

1622
01:58:14,470 --> 01:58:15,127
- What? Yeah.

1623
01:58:15,229 --> 01:58:17,322
- how'd you guys do?
- We did a'ight. Still playin;

1624
01:58:17,431 --> 01:58:19,661
Still playin'?
When's your next game?

1625
01:58:19,767 --> 01:58:21,613
- We gotta play Crane.
High school in Chicago.

1626
01:58:21,614 --> 01:58:22,167
- That's cool.

1627
01:58:22,270 --> 01:58:24,170
It'll be all right.

1628
01:58:49,362 --> 01:58:52,729
William is benched
for arriving late to the locker room...

1629
01:58:52,832 --> 01:58:55,733
and Nazareth threatens.

1630
01:59:02,742 --> 01:59:06,701
William enters the game to go head-to-head
with Nazareth star Sean Pearson...

1631
01:59:06,813 --> 01:59:09,975
his friend and roommate
from the Nike camp.

1632
01:59:18,190 --> 01:59:21,216
The favored Chargers
race to an early 14-point lead...

1633
01:59:21,327 --> 01:59:23,887
in this second-round play-off game.

1634
01:59:23,996 --> 01:59:27,295
Give me an "E"!
Give me an "R"!

1635
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:30,368
But near the end of the game...

1636
01:59:30,469 --> 01:59:32,437
St. Joe's begins to unravel.

1637
01:59:42,146 --> 01:59:44,046
William takes control.

1638
01:59:54,525 --> 01:59:57,016
Pearson responds.

1639
02:00:02,967 --> 02:00:07,062
His three-point shot gives the Roadrunners
their first lead of the game.

1640
02:00:11,541 --> 02:00:15,978
For the Chargers, their whole season
may come down to this possession.

1641
02:00:19,182 --> 02:00:21,707
Down by one,
with just over a minute remaining.

1642
02:00:21,818 --> 02:00:27,154
A loss tonight would be their earliest
exit from the play-offs in six years.

1643
02:00:27,257 --> 02:00:29,851
And for William,
there is no next year...

1644
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:32,292
no more chances to get downstate.

1645
02:01:44,498 --> 02:01:47,160
It ain't but one thing: bad coaching.

1646
02:01:47,267 --> 02:01:49,167
Bad coaching.

1647
02:01:51,739 --> 02:01:54,606
Well, we got him here
about five minutes late.

1648
02:01:54,708 --> 02:01:59,236
So what? This -This ain't no time
to be teaching nobody no lesson.

1649
02:02:10,389 --> 02:02:12,289
All right, boy.

1650
02:02:13,459 --> 02:02:15,427
It's all right, bro.

1651
02:02:17,296 --> 02:02:20,493
- You all right? You're crying, man.
- Shut up.

1652
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:22,864
Yeah.

1653
02:02:22,969 --> 02:02:25,494
- It hurt, don't it?
- Yeah. More than ever, man.

1654
02:02:25,605 --> 02:02:28,645
- I didn't never want
to go out this way, man.

1655
02:02:28,646 --> 02:02:30,133
- Your last year, man.

1656
02:02:30,243 --> 02:02:33,211
I'm trying to get it, man.
I'm striving for the same thing.

1657
02:02:36,748 --> 02:02:38,875
Hey, man. We'll call you.
Give me a ring. All right?

1658
02:02:38,984 --> 02:02:42,181
- All right.
- You played a good game, boy. All right.

1659
02:02:42,287 --> 02:02:45,222
You're gonna be all right.

1660
02:02:45,323 --> 02:02:47,883
- I love you, boy.
- I love you too, man.

1661
02:02:47,993 --> 02:02:49,961
All right.

1662
02:02:54,766 --> 02:02:57,894
William was 20 minutes late.

1663
02:02:58,003 --> 02:03:00,368
The team was dressed and already talking.

1664
02:03:00,471 --> 02:03:03,133
Then he came strolling in.

1665
02:03:03,240 --> 02:03:05,674
Maybe he has to learn something from that.

1666
02:03:05,776 --> 02:03:08,438
Even in a big game.

1667
02:03:11,482 --> 02:03:13,382
The game was a mirror-

1668
02:03:13,484 --> 02:03:16,385
It was a mirror
of all of the games all year.

1669
02:03:16,487 --> 02:03:21,584
To quote Isiah, the toughest loss
he ever took was the-

1670
02:03:21,692 --> 02:03:24,052
My toughest. And that
was the De La Salle game

1671
02:03:24,053 --> 02:03:26,061
in 1979 when we got beat at the buzzer.

1672
02:03:26,163 --> 02:03:30,155
On a 30-footer. And we were favored
to win the state that year.

1673
02:03:30,266 --> 02:03:35,135
Um, now we look back on it
as just one of those great moments in -

1674
02:03:35,238 --> 02:03:37,798
in our high school scene.

1675
02:03:37,907 --> 02:03:40,375
Our toughest loss to take,
and we talk about it.

1676
02:03:40,476 --> 02:03:43,468
So that's what I look at, you know,
with these things now.

1677
02:03:44,981 --> 02:03:48,178
- Arthur, we could have used you tonight.
- Yeah.

1678
02:03:48,284 --> 02:03:50,650
Good luck.
I'm gonna be watchin'. Don't forget.

1679
02:03:50,753 --> 02:03:52,653
Stay in touch.

1680
02:03:52,755 --> 02:03:54,655
- 'Cause we've talked about -You know.
- Yeah.

1681
02:03:54,757 --> 02:03:56,190
- School.
- Yeah.

1682
02:03:56,292 --> 02:03:58,486
All right. I'm watching you score.
How's your grades?

1683
02:03:58,594 --> 02:04:00,494
- They're all right.
- Good.

1684
02:04:00,596 --> 02:04:02,496
- They're all right.
- We missed you.

1685
02:04:02,598 --> 02:04:07,001
- I missed y'all too.
- Well, I'm proud of what you've done.

1686
02:04:07,102 --> 02:04:09,468
Mr. Bedford said
a lot of good things about you.

1687
02:04:09,571 --> 02:04:11,971
- You be in touch. Okay?
- Okay. All right.

1688
02:04:12,074 --> 02:04:13,974
- Good luck.
- All right. You too.

1689
02:04:37,965 --> 02:04:41,731
Marshall's second-round opponent,
Manley, presents little challenge.

1690
02:04:41,836 --> 02:04:45,169
This just explains a little bit
about our program...

1691
02:04:45,273 --> 02:04:47,468
where our program's headed.

1692
02:04:47,575 --> 02:04:50,203
I like what you're sayin;
and I want him close to home.

1693
02:04:50,311 --> 02:04:52,404
- Yeah.
- You know. And, uh -

1694
02:04:52,513 --> 02:04:54,845
I think, you know -
I'm kind of leaning your way...

1695
02:04:54,949 --> 02:04:57,771
because I just thank God
that he's getting into it -

1696
02:04:57,772 --> 02:04:59,476
you know, somebody do want him.

1697
02:05:01,988 --> 02:05:04,456
I'm Tommy Travis,
Northeastern Illinois assistant coach.

1698
02:05:04,557 --> 02:05:06,457
- Okay. Nice to meet you.
- I'm Arthur's father.

1699
02:05:06,559 --> 02:05:08,823
- Arthur hester.
- Okay. Arthur hester.

1700
02:05:08,929 --> 02:05:10,453
Us Arts gotta stick together.

1701
02:05:10,563 --> 02:05:11,962
- I'm over at Kennedy-King.
- Kennedy-King?

1702
02:05:12,065 --> 02:05:13,965
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1703
02:05:14,067 --> 02:05:16,160
May the best man win.

1704
02:05:16,269 --> 02:05:19,898
- I thought mom was a cheerleader.
- Oh, thanks.

1705
02:05:21,141 --> 02:05:23,109
Thank you for the compliment.

1706
02:05:23,209 --> 02:05:27,008
His parents seem to think
he may, uh, pass the A.C.T.

1707
02:05:27,112 --> 02:05:29,410
- he may what?
- He may pass it.

1708
02:05:29,515 --> 02:05:31,983
Oh, yeah.
Well, I hope he does.

1709
02:05:32,084 --> 02:05:34,609
- Us Arts gotta stick together, guy.
- Yeah.

1710
02:05:36,288 --> 02:05:38,085
- Okay.
- Hey.

1711
02:05:38,190 --> 02:05:41,353
Would you get excited if a college coach
came up and talked to you?

1712
02:05:42,394 --> 02:05:44,362
Not really.

1713
02:05:45,397 --> 02:05:47,297
Really, it's just-
You’re just going...

1714
02:05:47,399 --> 02:05:50,095
to another level
of basketball. That's all.

1715
02:05:50,202 --> 02:05:52,295
I'll be excited when I get there.

1716
02:05:52,404 --> 02:05:55,099
That's when you'll be
excited the whole year.

1717
02:05:55,206 --> 02:05:59,074
I'll be excited as soon as I step up
in there - first day of practice.

1718
02:06:00,545 --> 02:06:03,571
If I graduate, I think I'll be
the only one in my family...

1719
02:06:03,681 --> 02:06:06,514
besides my uncle,
to finish college.

1720
02:06:06,617 --> 02:06:08,812
Me too.

1721
02:06:11,422 --> 02:06:13,947
In the fourth round
against heavily favored Taft...

1722
02:06:14,058 --> 02:06:17,027
Marshall meets their first
true test of the play-offs.

1723
02:06:21,199 --> 02:06:23,928
But the Commandos have been
bucking the odds all year.

1724
02:06:34,044 --> 02:06:37,172
Arthur plays one of his best games
of the season...

1725
02:06:37,280 --> 02:06:39,180
scoring 19 points...

1726
02:06:39,282 --> 02:06:42,740
and the Commandos claim a spot
in the city semifinals.

1727
02:06:53,362 --> 02:06:58,390
The final four! I told y'all
he was going all the way. All the way!

1728
02:06:58,501 --> 02:07:01,197
Do you guys feel you can play with
any team in the city?

1729
02:07:01,303 --> 02:07:03,999
On any given day, we can play with anybody.
We can beat anybody.

1730
02:07:15,684 --> 02:07:18,209
Marshall now faces
the ultimate test::

1731
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:21,720
King high School,
the rulers of the public league.

1732
02:07:23,825 --> 02:07:25,920
Winners of last year's state crown,

1733
02:07:25,921 --> 02:07:28,694
they were labeled the
best team in the country.

1734
02:07:28,797 --> 02:07:32,460
King has sparked controversy
by out-recruiting rivals...

1735
02:07:32,567 --> 02:07:35,730
for the biggest and best
grammar school players.

1736
02:07:35,837 --> 02:07:40,274
We don't understand what
we're really doing to these young kids.

1737
02:07:40,375 --> 02:07:42,275
Kid not even 12 years old...

1738
02:07:42,377 --> 02:07:44,607
and you're baiting him
to come to your school...

1739
02:07:44,712 --> 02:07:46,612
you know, to play basketball.

1740
02:07:46,714 --> 02:07:48,807
Falls back in the paint.

1741
02:07:48,917 --> 02:07:51,612
I'm not going to start
recruiting in that manner.

1742
02:07:51,718 --> 02:07:55,017
No, I'll probably get out
of the game before then.

1743
02:07:57,324 --> 02:07:59,724
The winner of these two semifinal games...

1744
02:07:59,827 --> 02:08:03,786
will play for the Chicago Public
high School Basketball Championship.

1745
02:08:09,570 --> 02:08:14,940
King's strategy is to
go inside to its two seven-foot starters.

1746
02:08:19,378 --> 02:08:22,814
Only Arthur seems
unintimidated by the Jaguars.

1747
02:08:28,988 --> 02:08:31,752
And King's poor play
keeps the game close.

1748
02:08:32,792 --> 02:08:35,386
We are the... best.!
We are the team!

1749
02:08:35,495 --> 02:08:37,622
I think they gonna take it.

1750
02:08:38,664 --> 02:08:42,122
But in the second half,
King makes their move.

1751
02:08:45,938 --> 02:08:48,098
- What are you doin'?
- Come on. Get in the game.!

1752
02:08:48,206 --> 02:08:50,640
King grabs a four-point lead.

1753
02:08:50,742 --> 02:08:53,142
Hey, Mookie, Mookie, Mookie!

1754
02:08:53,245 --> 02:08:55,577
Y'all playing
with no confidence whatsoever.

1755
02:08:55,680 --> 02:08:57,614
None!

1756
02:08:57,716 --> 02:09:00,014
None.!

1757
02:09:00,118 --> 02:09:03,019
- All right! Go get in charge of that ball!
- Don't foul him! Don't foul him!

1758
02:09:07,859 --> 02:09:09,326
Let's go! Let's go!

1759
02:09:09,427 --> 02:09:12,362
The Commandos get aggressive on defense...

1760
02:09:12,464 --> 02:09:14,659
Too soon now!

1761
02:09:14,766 --> 02:09:17,825
And use their superior speed on offense.

1762
02:09:29,613 --> 02:09:32,741
Players, sit down.
We got three minutes to go. Sit down.

1763
02:09:32,850 --> 02:09:35,944
Marshall grabs a six-point lead
late in the game.

1764
02:09:36,053 --> 02:09:38,044
We got a long time to play.

1765
02:09:39,423 --> 02:09:42,551
Coach Bedford wants to force King
out of their zone defense...

1766
02:09:42,660 --> 02:09:46,993
and make their big, slow players match up
man-to-man against Marshall's quick guards.

1767
02:09:47,096 --> 02:09:49,496
One, two, three. Defense!

1768
02:09:53,369 --> 02:09:56,702
Arthur simply holds the ball
as the clock ticks away.

1769
02:10:03,179 --> 02:10:05,807
The King coach has no choice.

1770
02:10:24,933 --> 02:10:28,596
For the defending national champions,
it's all over.

1771
02:10:34,376 --> 02:10:37,641
And unranked Marshall
will play for the city title.

1772
02:10:55,263 --> 02:10:59,461
Whoo! 26-2 now!

1773
02:11:01,235 --> 02:11:03,669
They're 26 and 2 now.

1774
02:11:03,771 --> 02:11:06,296
That's my Man!

1775
02:11:07,341 --> 02:11:09,639
All right, Man!

1776
02:11:09,744 --> 02:11:11,644
- I told you we could do it.
- Yes!

1777
02:11:11,746 --> 02:11:14,475
- I told you we could do it.
- I told you you were gonna do it.

1778
02:11:14,581 --> 02:11:16,481
I knew y'all was going all the way.
I told ya.

1779
02:11:16,583 --> 02:11:18,483
I said, "You're going all the way."

1780
02:11:19,519 --> 02:11:22,886
This is your last year.
You're going all the way. Yeah.

1781
02:11:24,958 --> 02:11:28,052
They got the best shot of him, you know.

1782
02:11:28,161 --> 02:11:31,562
And it's great.
That was a great shot, wasn't it?

1783
02:11:31,665 --> 02:11:36,193
But this one in the, uh, Tribune
is what I really like.

1784
02:11:36,303 --> 02:11:40,103
It says,
"Arthur Agee stood as still as a statue.

1785
02:11:40,206 --> 02:11:43,572
Time after time was on his side."

1786
02:11:43,676 --> 02:11:47,009
You know, the championship
that I missed when I was in high school-

1787
02:11:47,112 --> 02:11:49,012
Yeah.

1788
02:11:49,114 --> 02:11:52,743
Twenty-one years later I got a chance
at getting a championship through him.

1789
02:11:52,851 --> 02:11:55,376
You know, you're always trying to
build your children up...

1790
02:11:55,487 --> 02:11:57,387
and saying, "Well, you-all can do it"...

1791
02:11:57,489 --> 02:12:00,287
but, you know, really lying on
the inside a little bit, saying...

1792
02:12:00,392 --> 02:12:02,292
"Well, you know, you got a long haul."

1793
02:12:02,394 --> 02:12:04,453
But, you know,
this make you even more confidence...

1794
02:12:04,563 --> 02:12:07,498
because if he's sure of hisself,
then you know you can bank on it.

1795
02:12:07,599 --> 02:12:12,092
Yesterday, you know, when he won the game,
you know, he told me he loved me.

1796
02:12:12,203 --> 02:12:14,865
And, you know, I haven't heard that
in, uh -You know.

1797
02:12:14,972 --> 02:12:19,409
You can feel it, but I haven't heard it
coming verbally from him.

1798
02:12:30,021 --> 02:12:33,479
In a rematch with rival Westinghouse...

1799
02:12:33,591 --> 02:12:37,652
Marshall proves to everybody
they have what it takes to be city champs.

1800
02:12:37,762 --> 02:12:40,594
Inside pass. Shot rejected.

1801
02:12:44,935 --> 02:12:47,802
To the lane with the layin.

1802
02:12:47,904 --> 02:12:50,668
Busts this game wide open.

1803
02:12:50,774 --> 02:12:55,143
Did you see that?
Did you see it? Did you see it?

1804
02:12:56,613 --> 02:12:59,673
They are celebrating because they know...

1805
02:12:59,783 --> 02:13:02,809
their high school is headed
to the elite eight in Champaign.

1806
02:13:06,490 --> 02:13:10,289
And the Marshall Commandos
have won the Public League Championship...

1807
02:13:10,393 --> 02:13:12,520
in convincing fashion-

1808
02:13:12,628 --> 02:13:17,622
58-38 winners over
the Westinghouse Warriors.

1809
02:13:31,614 --> 02:13:34,549
What's up, man?
Told you on the phone what I was gonna do.

1810
02:13:34,650 --> 02:13:36,618
Told you, boy.

1811
02:13:39,788 --> 02:13:42,586
Marshall, baby. Marshall!

1812
02:13:42,690 --> 02:13:44,590
Marshall!

1813
02:13:44,692 --> 02:13:48,492
Marshall.! Marshall.!

1814
02:13:48,596 --> 02:13:52,430
Marshall.! Marshall.!

1815
02:13:59,574 --> 02:14:03,567
Your A.C.T. came in, William,
and you received a 14 for a composite...

1816
02:14:03,678 --> 02:14:05,873
which is not high enough.

1817
02:14:05,980 --> 02:14:08,709
Uh, you've taken the test-
Now, this was for the fourth time.

1818
02:14:08,816 --> 02:14:12,308
Now, if you add all those up,
it comes out to 17.2.

1819
02:14:12,419 --> 02:14:15,183
In order to play at Marquette,
you're gonna have to get the 18.

1820
02:14:15,289 --> 02:14:17,189
And they're very, very concerned.

1821
02:14:17,291 --> 02:14:21,227
One assistant called twice this week,
and Bo Ellis called today.

1822
02:14:23,363 --> 02:14:25,991
Smile, William.
It's not the end of the world.

1823
02:14:26,099 --> 02:14:28,033
- Right?
- I hope not.

1824
02:14:28,135 --> 02:14:31,366
Well, you gotta work at this
as hard as you worked at your jump shot.

1825
02:14:31,472 --> 02:14:33,963
And it was missing a lot this year.

1826
02:14:34,074 --> 02:14:36,041
Okay.

1827
02:14:36,142 --> 02:14:39,669
Now you are down to the final inning
and the last strike.

1828
02:14:46,118 --> 02:14:49,053
We're going, going downstate!
We're going downstate!

1829
02:14:49,155 --> 02:14:52,318
Now let's, let's celebrate!
Now let's celebrate!

1830
02:14:52,425 --> 02:14:55,189
- What are we gonna be?
- State champions.!

1831
02:14:55,294 --> 02:14:58,161
Your Marshall Commandos.!

1832
02:15:02,568 --> 02:15:04,660
- Yeah!
- We're gonna take state!

1833
02:15:04,769 --> 02:15:06,930
Take state! Number one!

1834
02:15:32,831 --> 02:15:35,663
Beat B-A - B-A-T-A-V-I-A.!

1835
02:15:35,766 --> 02:15:38,758
Beat B-A - B-A-T-A-V-I-A.!

1836
02:15:38,869 --> 02:15:42,965
Beat B-A - B-A-T-A-V-I-A!

1837
02:15:52,016 --> 02:15:56,043
Downstate Marshall plays
its familiar role as underdog...

1838
02:15:56,153 --> 02:15:58,053
to third-ranked Batavia.

1839
02:15:58,155 --> 02:16:00,055
Justice has it. Justice, one-on-two.

1840
02:16:00,157 --> 02:16:02,750
- Spins up-
- Nice move.

1841
02:16:06,663 --> 02:16:10,724
In the media glare of a statewide
audience, Marshall shows big-game jitters.

1842
02:16:10,833 --> 02:16:12,767
Now bust out.

1843
02:16:12,869 --> 02:16:15,702
And Marshall missed the layup.

1844
02:16:17,206 --> 02:16:19,640
Sealed off, blocked by Williams.

1845
02:16:19,742 --> 02:16:23,644
You got easy shots.
You gotta make your easy shots.

1846
02:16:23,746 --> 02:16:25,714
I can't shoot for you.

1847
02:16:25,815 --> 02:16:30,514
Now he's gonna penetrate.
Left it for Christian. Missed the shot.

1848
02:16:30,620 --> 02:16:35,522
Luther Bedford looks like
he's ready to commit suicide over there.

1849
02:16:35,624 --> 02:16:38,218
Y'all better get on your job,
Commandos!

1850
02:16:38,327 --> 02:16:40,454
- Now into the corner.
- Get in there.

1851
02:16:40,562 --> 02:16:43,929
Batavia's got these guys on the run.

1852
02:16:46,034 --> 02:16:47,934
One, one, one, one!

1853
02:16:48,036 --> 02:16:50,504
One, one, one, one.!

1854
02:16:51,974 --> 02:16:55,034
But in the third quarter,
the Commandos charge back.

1855
02:16:55,143 --> 02:16:57,043
And a steal by Marshall.!

1856
02:16:57,145 --> 02:16:59,841
Agee gonna take it all the way.

1857
02:16:59,948 --> 02:17:04,111
Yes! That's the way you go!

1858
02:17:04,218 --> 02:17:06,379
- here we go.
- Picked him clean.

1859
02:17:06,487 --> 02:17:08,421
Dale. Marshall leads.

1860
02:17:08,522 --> 02:17:11,616
Marshall's first lead
since the first quarter.

1861
02:17:11,726 --> 02:17:14,718
Like a lightning bolt,
the Commandos have struck.

1862
02:17:14,829 --> 02:17:18,356
37-36, Marshall leading Batavia.

1863
02:17:18,466 --> 02:17:21,196
Chicago Marshall has exploded-

1864
02:17:25,940 --> 02:17:27,874
I always dreamed of, like...

1865
02:17:27,975 --> 02:17:30,772
me and William taking
them downstate together.

1866
02:17:31,878 --> 02:17:33,778
When I was at St. Joseph...

1867
02:17:33,880 --> 02:17:36,474
maybe we could have went downstate,
and maybe we couldn't.

1868
02:17:36,583 --> 02:17:39,518
But we did when I'm at Marshall.

1869
02:17:53,133 --> 02:17:55,727
Arthur's big fourth quarter
helps add Batavia...

1870
02:17:55,835 --> 02:17:57,769
to Marshall's growing list of upsets.

1871
02:17:57,871 --> 02:18:01,465
Spectacular comeback
in the fourth quarter by the Commandos-

1872
02:18:01,573 --> 02:18:03,473
In the post-game news conference...

1873
02:18:03,575 --> 02:18:06,772
Coach Bedford labels
his unranked team "the giant killers. '"

1874
02:18:10,783 --> 02:18:13,513
- Y'all are playing the number one team.
- We're playing the number one team.

1875
02:18:13,619 --> 02:18:15,519
We're playing the number two team.

1876
02:18:15,621 --> 02:18:19,489
This is the first time in the history
of the school that we've gone this far.

1877
02:18:19,591 --> 02:18:22,219
- Really?
- In the history of the school.

1878
02:18:22,327 --> 02:18:24,693
Just like the Commandos.
See, we been the underdog.

1879
02:18:24,797 --> 02:18:28,197
I'm glad we are because then
it just show you how you could come up.

1880
02:18:28,299 --> 02:18:30,824
And then you beat your opponent.

1881
02:18:33,037 --> 02:18:35,267
Oh, yeah.

1882
02:18:49,187 --> 02:18:52,179
Be a good place for Man to come.

1883
02:18:52,290 --> 02:18:55,453
Yeah. This is really, you know,
something that a -

1884
02:18:55,560 --> 02:18:58,153
a child would really miss out on.

1885
02:18:58,261 --> 02:19:00,821
Like a whole different world.

1886
02:19:00,931 --> 02:19:02,922
It's beyond different.

1887
02:19:03,033 --> 02:19:05,661
Uh-huh.

1888
02:19:13,744 --> 02:19:17,544
In this semifinal game,
we'll see some great individuals...

1889
02:19:17,647 --> 02:19:19,672
just as we saw many years ago.

1890
02:19:19,783 --> 02:19:22,752
Remember Isiah Thomas,
one of the great guards.

1891
02:19:22,853 --> 02:19:26,253
Here you see the same moves
he plays with in the NBA today.

1892
02:19:26,355 --> 02:19:30,348
Well, we've got someone like that:
howard Nathan, number 34...

1893
02:19:30,459 --> 02:19:32,393
for Peoria Manual.

1894
02:19:32,495 --> 02:19:34,588
Marshall got here because of
one reason: quickness.

1895
02:19:34,697 --> 02:19:38,827
The reason: Arthur Agee.
Look at this man. he just explodes, Dan.

1896
02:19:38,934 --> 02:19:42,631
He can get down court
as quick as anyone I've ever seen.

1897
02:19:42,738 --> 02:19:44,638
In the semifinals...

1898
02:19:44,740 --> 02:19:48,107
Arthur goes head-to-head
with howard Nathan, the all-American.

1899
02:19:48,210 --> 02:19:51,236
Make him work for it, Man.
Make him work for what he get.

1900
02:19:52,281 --> 02:19:55,408
All right! Let's go!
All the way, Man! All the way!

1901
02:19:56,751 --> 02:19:59,743
Yeah! That's it! That's it! That's it!

1902
02:19:59,854 --> 02:20:04,484
Arthur Agee, spinning inside,
tough shot. Good.

1903
02:20:04,592 --> 02:20:06,787
Arthur has a great first half...

1904
02:20:06,895 --> 02:20:09,125
but the Rams play even better.

1905
02:20:10,799 --> 02:20:13,199
He's got it.

1906
02:20:14,235 --> 02:20:16,931
Get up for the Rams!
Everybody get up!

1907
02:20:17,038 --> 02:20:19,302
Get up for the Rams.!

1908
02:20:19,407 --> 02:20:22,934
In the second half,
Arthur tries to pick up where he left off.

1909
02:20:23,044 --> 02:20:24,807
Penetration move by Agee. Slapped

1910
02:20:24,808 --> 02:20:27,207
out of there by Manual.
They've got two-on-one.

1911
02:20:27,314 --> 02:20:30,249
Ooh, and a nice fake and a score.

1912
02:20:30,350 --> 02:20:33,183
But it's the Rams who don't miss a beat...

1913
02:20:33,287 --> 02:20:35,221
pressing the tempo against
the tired Commandos.

1914
02:20:35,322 --> 02:20:37,984
You're not in the offense at all.

1915
02:20:38,091 --> 02:20:40,719
You're just out there
playing individual basketball.

1916
02:20:40,828 --> 02:20:42,728
Completely.

1917
02:20:42,830 --> 02:20:46,857
Hey, hey, guys. No fouls.
We want to keep the clock going. Remember?

1918
02:20:46,967 --> 02:20:48,992
Let's go, Marshall!
Let's go!

1919
02:20:49,102 --> 02:20:51,832
Let's go, Marshall.!
Let's go.!

1920
02:20:51,939 --> 02:20:55,032
Marshall showed us last night
they have the ability to come back.

1921
02:20:55,141 --> 02:20:57,132
Let's see what they can do here.

1922
02:21:11,791 --> 02:21:13,884
This is Nathan.

1923
02:21:13,993 --> 02:21:15,893
Nice pass.
Knock it down.

1924
02:21:15,995 --> 02:21:19,795
Biggest lead of the game now,
and the Rams fans can smell it.

1925
02:21:21,299 --> 02:21:24,166
Been a great run
for Luther Bedford's team.

1926
02:21:25,203 --> 02:21:27,569
The string of upsets stops here.

1927
02:21:29,207 --> 02:21:32,199
- And a foul on Agee.
- He fouls out.

1928
02:21:32,310 --> 02:21:35,473
But he just never quit.
He just kept going for the basketball.

1929
02:21:40,418 --> 02:21:44,878
I wouldn't be surprised
if he made the all-tournament team tonight.

1930
02:22:05,209 --> 02:22:07,734
- Number one!
- We're number one.!

1931
02:22:07,845 --> 02:22:09,779
We're still number one.

1932
02:22:09,880 --> 02:22:11,780
All right. All right.

1933
02:22:11,882 --> 02:22:13,873
Though they lose to Peoria Manual...

1934
02:22:13,984 --> 02:22:19,115
they finish third in the state, the highest
a Marshall team has finished since 1960.

1935
02:22:21,691 --> 02:22:25,149
This was a great season you had.

1936
02:22:25,261 --> 02:22:30,358
There is nothing sweeter
than going downstate as a young person.

1937
02:22:30,466 --> 02:22:32,832
I mean, the record's
gonna stay there, you know.

1938
02:22:32,936 --> 02:22:36,303
1991, there was a team
from Marshall played.

1939
02:22:36,406 --> 02:22:38,636
- You know, and you're part of that.
- Yeah.

1940
02:22:38,741 --> 02:22:40,868
- That's part of history.
- Ah!

1941
02:22:40,977 --> 02:22:44,140
But for you seniors, you know-

1942
02:22:44,247 --> 02:22:49,309
Best wishes to all you seniors,
and whatever you try to do, uh...

1943
02:22:49,418 --> 02:22:51,909
Mr. Williams and I
will be around school...

1944
02:22:52,020 --> 02:22:53,920
as we always are -

1945
02:22:54,022 --> 02:22:56,752
to help you if you want to be helped, okay?

1946
02:22:58,994 --> 02:23:02,725
Winning five games in six days,
that really takes a lot out of you.

1947
02:23:02,831 --> 02:23:05,823
Like Coach said, you just gotta sacrifice-

1948
02:23:05,934 --> 02:23:07,925
you know, sacrifice everything you have.

1949
02:23:08,036 --> 02:23:09,765
Like, if you love the
game of basketball,

1950
02:23:09,766 --> 02:23:11,699
you just go out there
and give all your heart.

1951
02:23:11,807 --> 02:23:14,867
He got a little ways to go,
but he's - he's gonna get there.

1952
02:23:14,977 --> 02:23:17,501
Hopefully he's got his head
screwed on pretty good, you know...

1953
02:23:17,611 --> 02:23:21,775
and now, you know,
he's gonna be on his own to do whatever.

1954
02:23:21,882 --> 02:23:23,782
Hopefully he'll do it right.

1955
02:23:23,884 --> 02:23:27,513
When we got down here, people don't expect
- "Marshall? how'd they get down here?"

1956
02:23:27,621 --> 02:23:29,614
They lookin' like: "Who
they got on their team?"

1957
02:23:29,615 --> 02:23:31,079
I had to come out and prove myself.

1958
02:23:31,192 --> 02:23:34,923
I think I could play Division I basketball.

1959
02:23:35,029 --> 02:23:38,988
'Cause all I need is just a scholarship.
That's -That's all I'm looking for.

1960
02:23:39,100 --> 02:23:41,068
Arthur Agee.

1961
02:23:46,306 --> 02:23:48,274
All right!

1962
02:24:08,661 --> 02:24:11,960
All this area through here
is our new computer labs.

1963
02:24:12,065 --> 02:24:13,999
We'll take you through
all those rooms.

1964
02:24:14,100 --> 02:24:16,124
Arthur's first recruiting visit...

1965
02:24:16,235 --> 02:24:18,396
takes him to a junior college
in Southern Missouri.

1966
02:24:18,504 --> 02:24:20,652
The strength that I see here

1967
02:24:20,653 --> 02:24:23,908
is the tremendous
teaching that goes on here.

1968
02:24:24,009 --> 02:24:26,273
Have you decided
what you want to go into?

1969
02:24:26,378 --> 02:24:28,573
Uh, communications.

1970
02:24:28,680 --> 02:24:32,639
Are you more interested
in the overall communications -

1971
02:24:32,751 --> 02:24:35,311
That, and, uh -
I like that and accounting.

1972
02:24:35,421 --> 02:24:37,753
- Like business.
- Oh. Okay.

1973
02:24:37,856 --> 02:24:41,792
We enjoy winning things,
but the primary purpose is your education.

1974
02:24:41,894 --> 02:24:44,055
What are some of your career goals,
may I ask?

1975
02:24:44,163 --> 02:24:48,531
I want to fall back to,
like, make - have my own business.

1976
02:24:48,633 --> 02:24:50,601
Like real estate.

1977
02:24:53,404 --> 02:24:55,702
This is where it all happens.

1978
02:24:55,807 --> 02:24:58,901
Beautiful place.
And it gets to rockin;

1979
02:24:59,010 --> 02:25:01,911
- You gonna try it on there?
- Yeah.

1980
02:25:02,013 --> 02:25:04,607
Those are about $ 120 apiece.

1981
02:25:07,718 --> 02:25:10,278
You need to be very careful
with this decision.

1982
02:25:10,388 --> 02:25:12,549
You know, if you come in and act right,
you're going out of here...

1983
02:25:12,657 --> 02:25:14,556
with two years
of your college finished...

1984
02:25:14,658 --> 02:25:18,321
a scholarship to a Division I university.

1985
02:25:18,428 --> 02:25:22,728
Exactly where you'd want to be-
on track to graduate in four years.

1986
02:25:49,258 --> 02:25:51,249
Mineral Area doesn't have dorms...

1987
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:54,386
but it does have a basketball house.

1988
02:25:54,497 --> 02:25:58,092
All the ballplayers
on scholarship live here.

1989
02:25:58,200 --> 02:26:00,634
Get your ass up, nigga.

1990
02:26:04,707 --> 02:26:07,175
Of the seven blacks
in the entire school...

1991
02:26:07,276 --> 02:26:09,244
six live in this house.

1992
02:26:13,715 --> 02:26:18,084
You come in and look at this little house,
then after a while you get used to it.

1993
02:26:19,120 --> 02:26:21,020
Try to make a little home, you know.

1994
02:26:21,122 --> 02:26:23,056
Home away from home anyway.

1995
02:26:26,261 --> 02:26:28,661
We hang around each other most of the time.

1996
02:26:28,763 --> 02:26:30,993
We know who to trust,
who not to trust.

1997
02:26:33,334 --> 02:26:36,565
I just want to go somewhere
where I'm gonna play.

1998
02:26:36,671 --> 02:26:38,639
I can get the grades.

1999
02:26:41,942 --> 02:26:43,910
I love basketball.

2000
02:26:54,221 --> 02:26:56,415
How many of your
players that leave there

2001
02:26:56,416 --> 02:26:58,658
and they end up going
to a four-year college?

2002
02:26:58,759 --> 02:27:00,659
- Thirty-one sophomores in a row.
- Really?

2003
02:27:00,761 --> 02:27:02,661
Every last one of 'em he coached.

2004
02:27:02,763 --> 02:27:05,425
- hi. how you doing?
- Hey. how you doing?

2005
02:27:05,532 --> 02:27:08,524
- Arthur Sr.
- Bo and Sheila have been separated.

2006
02:27:08,635 --> 02:27:13,003
She asked him to return today
over Arthur's objections.

2007
02:27:13,105 --> 02:27:15,369
I'll show you exactly
what the scholarship entails.

2008
02:27:15,474 --> 02:27:18,238
Is this a full scholarship
for the two years?

2009
02:27:18,344 --> 02:27:22,747
The reason I'm skeptical is because of
the promises that was made in the past.

2010
02:27:22,848 --> 02:27:24,472
From the time he comes down there

2011
02:27:24,473 --> 02:27:26,909
until he leaves, you will
not have a financial need.

2012
02:27:27,019 --> 02:27:29,783
Now, when you make this decision...

2013
02:27:29,889 --> 02:27:31,789
you got to live and die with it.

2014
02:27:31,891 --> 02:27:33,791
'Cause it's your decision to make.

2015
02:27:33,893 --> 02:27:37,954
Now, I'm here to support you if you -
if you done searched this whole thing.

2016
02:27:38,064 --> 02:27:39,963
And it's what you really want.

2017
02:27:40,065 --> 02:27:42,829
Not, you know,
'cause Mama said this or your dad-

2018
02:27:42,934 --> 02:27:45,960
Or because you're saving
Mama money, because if we have to...

2019
02:27:46,071 --> 02:27:48,335
we will still pay-
if you have to try to pay-

2020
02:27:48,440 --> 02:27:50,465
if we can put some-
I'm just sayin;

2021
02:27:50,575 --> 02:27:54,170
You - Understand what you're saying. You
want to save somebody money, but still -

2022
02:27:54,279 --> 02:27:56,372
But you have to still do
what is best from here.

2023
02:27:56,481 --> 02:27:59,917
But still we want the best for you -
even if you have to -

2024
02:28:00,018 --> 02:28:02,282
or we have to go in the hole, you know.

2025
02:28:02,387 --> 02:28:04,412
You understand what I'm
saying? I'm just saying.

2026
02:28:04,413 --> 02:28:05,982
But still, the decision is up to you.

2027
02:28:09,226 --> 02:28:11,820
So, what do you think?

2028
02:28:11,929 --> 02:28:13,897
Ah.

2029
02:28:16,100 --> 02:28:18,125
- Ready to sign it?
- Yeah.

2030
02:28:19,203 --> 02:28:22,195
- Yep.
- Let's do it up.

2031
02:28:27,711 --> 02:28:29,838
- What time is it?
- 1:56.

2032
02:28:29,947 --> 02:28:31,915
56.

2033
02:28:44,560 --> 02:28:46,289
Come on, Bo.
Whip it to him.

2034
02:28:46,396 --> 02:28:48,796
When I was 23, how old was he?

2035
02:28:48,898 --> 02:28:50,798
And I whupped him then.

2036
02:28:52,802 --> 02:28:54,463
Aw!

2037
02:28:54,570 --> 02:28:56,538
You want to see it rain?

2038
02:28:56,639 --> 02:28:59,540
Let it rain.!

2039
02:28:59,642 --> 02:29:02,076
- You want to see it rain?
- One more time.

2040
02:29:02,178 --> 02:29:04,373
Let it rain!

2041
02:29:04,480 --> 02:29:06,640
You want to see it rain?

2042
02:29:06,748 --> 02:29:09,046
Let it rain!

2043
02:29:09,151 --> 02:29:11,119
Oh!

2044
02:29:12,921 --> 02:29:15,549
Peoria Manual.
Remember what they did to you now.

2045
02:29:15,657 --> 02:29:17,750
Yeah. Do you know howard Nathan?

2046
02:29:17,859 --> 02:29:20,487
And I strung him up,
just like that.

2047
02:29:23,332 --> 02:29:27,393
Uh-oh. Like father, like son.
What's up with that?

2048
02:29:27,502 --> 02:29:30,232
You better stick to church music,
leave that basketball alone.

2049
02:29:35,710 --> 02:29:39,202
Hell, no. You can't do that.

2050
02:29:39,313 --> 02:29:41,440
Foul! Foul!

2051
02:29:43,284 --> 02:29:45,184
Foul. Foul, foul, foul.

2052
02:29:45,286 --> 02:29:47,186
- That's 32.
- That's 34.

2053
02:29:47,288 --> 02:29:49,188
- 34!
- That didn't count 'cause he called "Bo."

2054
02:29:49,290 --> 02:29:51,724
- That's 34!
- That's 32!

2055
02:29:51,826 --> 02:29:53,726
- he didn't hit nothing else.!
- I did!

2056
02:29:53,828 --> 02:29:56,353
- he didn't hit nothing else!
- It's 34-28, Bo.

2057
02:29:56,464 --> 02:29:58,364
- Bo's a sore loser.
- All right!

2058
02:29:58,466 --> 02:30:01,799
- No. I know how to count though.
- Ain't no con game. I'm older now.

2059
02:30:01,902 --> 02:30:03,994
- Yeah.
- Ain't no con game going on no more.

2060
02:30:04,104 --> 02:30:07,232
- No more. Ain't no more.
- The score is 32 to 28.

2061
02:30:07,340 --> 02:30:09,900
Now, you can play for 32 if you want to.

2062
02:30:10,009 --> 02:30:12,375
Game over with.
I can con too.

2063
02:30:12,479 --> 02:30:14,777
Losers quit. I'm ready to play.

2064
02:30:14,881 --> 02:30:16,712
Now, youse a coward if you don't-
Check ball.

2065
02:30:16,816 --> 02:30:18,943
- You're mad now.
- Check ball.

2066
02:30:19,052 --> 02:30:19,920
- Throw it over there.

2067
02:30:19,921 --> 02:30:22,249
- You ain't two years old.
You ain't gettin' no pacifier.

2068
02:30:22,355 --> 02:30:24,255
- Give me that.
- Yeah.

2069
02:30:24,357 --> 02:30:27,190
Your mama ain't here
to give you this ball. Let's go.

2070
02:30:27,293 --> 02:30:29,818
- Give me the rock.
- Let's make it rain. Make it rain.

2071
02:30:31,931 --> 02:30:34,398
Bang. Bang. Right there.

2072
02:30:34,500 --> 02:30:37,469
Ha! Go sit down.
Go sit down.

2073
02:30:37,569 --> 02:30:39,901
Bo, it's raining.!

2074
02:30:40,005 --> 02:30:41,973
Bo, it's raining.

2075
02:30:42,074 --> 02:30:43,974
- It's raining, Bo!
- It's raining, Bo!

2076
02:30:44,076 --> 02:30:46,874
You're on punishment when you get home.
You're on punishment when you get home.

2077
02:30:46,979 --> 02:30:50,710
And you're on punishment
when you get home. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2078
02:30:52,151 --> 02:30:54,278
It's gonna rain on your head, Bo.

2079
02:30:59,625 --> 02:31:01,751
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen...

2080
02:31:01,859 --> 02:31:05,488
and welcome to St. Joseph's
Annual Basketball Awards Dinner.

2081
02:31:05,596 --> 02:31:08,360
We had a...

2082
02:31:08,466 --> 02:31:10,457
difficult year.

2083
02:31:10,568 --> 02:31:12,468
Most of you are aware of that.

2084
02:31:12,570 --> 02:31:13,898
When I first went to St. Joe's,

2085
02:31:13,899 --> 02:31:15,733
I really did sleep, eat
and drink basketball.

2086
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:17,740
That was all I did.

2087
02:31:17,842 --> 02:31:21,972
But it became more of a job
than a sport to play.

2088
02:31:22,079 --> 02:31:25,014
Things here have not changed since-

2089
02:31:25,116 --> 02:31:30,053
You know, Coach Pingatore
just had these dreams in his head.

2090
02:31:32,055 --> 02:31:36,082
He just wanted me to go
the same route he took Isiah.

2091
02:31:37,127 --> 02:31:39,960
The most steals.

2092
02:31:40,063 --> 02:31:45,023
He played as a freshman.
Not even Isiah was a four-year starter.

2093
02:31:45,135 --> 02:31:48,434
You know, basketball was just like-
he was possessed with it.

2094
02:31:48,538 --> 02:31:50,597
You know, it was his life.

2095
02:31:50,707 --> 02:31:53,301
And he wanted it to be
everybody else's life too.

2096
02:31:53,410 --> 02:31:55,640
All-conference in the SCC.

2097
02:31:55,745 --> 02:31:57,713
All-state in the Sun-Times.

2098
02:31:57,814 --> 02:32:00,839
A McDonald All-American nomination.

2099
02:32:00,950 --> 02:32:06,855
M. V.P., 1990-1991 season,
William Gates.

2100
02:32:25,975 --> 02:32:28,034
When I had some real problems...

2101
02:32:28,142 --> 02:32:30,576
I couldn't go to
none of them about it.

2102
02:32:32,747 --> 02:32:36,080
You know, I was having some problems
with Catherine's family and my family...

2103
02:32:36,184 --> 02:32:40,553
and I said, you know, "Coach Pingatore,
their family's been getting on me about...

2104
02:32:40,655 --> 02:32:43,749
you know, I'm not doing this,
and I'm not doing that."

2105
02:32:43,858 --> 02:32:46,292
And the only thing
Coach Pingatore could say is...

2106
02:32:47,328 --> 02:32:49,228
"Write 'em off."

2107
02:32:49,330 --> 02:32:50,819
That was all he told me.

2108
02:32:50,820 --> 02:32:53,858
And I was, like, "What
kind of advice is that?"

2109
02:32:58,105 --> 02:33:01,040
Well, how's it feel to be finishing?

2110
02:33:03,243 --> 02:33:05,677
Uh, I mean-

2111
02:33:07,514 --> 02:33:09,505
Now, don't say anything
you don't mean, William.

2112
02:33:09,616 --> 02:33:12,585
I mean, I'm serious, Coach.
I enjoyed my four years.

2113
02:33:12,686 --> 02:33:15,154
I mean, we had our run-ins, and, uh -

2114
02:33:15,255 --> 02:33:17,155
- Who had run-ins?
- Me and you.

2115
02:33:17,257 --> 02:33:17,859
- We did?

2116
02:33:17,860 --> 02:33:20,420
- Yeah. Like that time
you made me run 75 stairs.

2117
02:33:20,527 --> 02:33:22,495
- I never f-
- You never forgot that.

2118
02:33:22,596 --> 02:33:24,496
Never.

2119
02:33:24,598 --> 02:33:27,505
See, you should have been
happy and enthusiastic

2120
02:33:27,506 --> 02:33:29,159
about doing your punishment.

2121
02:33:29,268 --> 02:33:33,762
But someday
you're gonna learn that, uh...

2122
02:33:33,873 --> 02:33:36,137
everything that was done
was for your benefit.

2123
02:33:36,242 --> 02:33:39,187
So that you can come
back four years from now

2124
02:33:39,188 --> 02:33:41,111
and say, "Coach, you were right.

2125
02:33:41,213 --> 02:33:43,647
"Everything that happened
at St. Joe's helped me a lot...

2126
02:33:43,749 --> 02:33:45,717
and as a result I got a degree. '"

2127
02:33:45,818 --> 02:33:47,718
That's what I'm hoping for.

2128
02:33:47,820 --> 02:33:50,152
I'm going into communication...

2129
02:33:50,256 --> 02:33:54,317
so when you start asking for a donation,
I'll know the right way to turn you down.

2130
02:33:54,427 --> 02:33:57,361
I'm sure you'll never turn us down.

2131
02:33:57,462 --> 02:33:59,362
Ah.

2132
02:34:01,399 --> 02:34:06,166
I never really felt
that he bought into the system.

2133
02:34:06,271 --> 02:34:09,707
He was never convinced what he was
doing was the right thing to do.

2134
02:34:10,742 --> 02:34:14,007
But overall he had a good career-
not a great career.

2135
02:34:14,112 --> 02:34:16,012
It's never good-bye.

2136
02:34:16,114 --> 02:34:19,015
Could've been different
if the injury didn't occur.

2137
02:34:19,117 --> 02:34:21,210
But it did occur.

2138
02:34:21,319 --> 02:34:24,412
- And that was the big difference.
- I'm proud of what you did.

2139
02:34:24,521 --> 02:34:26,682
- Okay.
- I expect you to do a lot better.

2140
02:34:26,790 --> 02:34:28,690
I don't want this to be the-

2141
02:34:28,792 --> 02:34:30,760
- Yeah.
- You know, the highlight of your career.

2142
02:34:30,861 --> 02:34:33,557
You've got a lot of
bigger and better things to do.

2143
02:34:33,664 --> 02:34:36,064
I'll see you later.
Good luck.

2144
02:34:39,370 --> 02:34:41,338
Well...

2145
02:34:42,606 --> 02:34:45,734
another one walks out the door,
and another one comes in the door.

2146
02:34:45,843 --> 02:34:47,777
That's what it's all about.

2147
02:35:26,248 --> 02:35:28,216
It came through for me.

2148
02:35:28,316 --> 02:35:30,784
- Got the score I needed.
- All right.

2149
02:35:30,886 --> 02:35:32,786
And, hey...

2150
02:35:33,822 --> 02:35:35,722
I'm eligible.

2151
02:35:36,992 --> 02:35:39,583
You know, this is one
of the greatest feelings

2152
02:35:39,584 --> 02:35:41,292
in the world. That's about it.

2153
02:35:41,396 --> 02:35:43,296
I mean -

2154
02:35:45,167 --> 02:35:49,001
After five attempts,
William's composite score of 17.5...

2155
02:35:49,104 --> 02:35:51,003
is rounded up to 18...

2156
02:35:51,105 --> 02:35:54,836
and he can finally accept a scholarship
to play at Marquette.

2157
02:36:20,333 --> 02:36:22,893
I think my mom...

2158
02:36:23,002 --> 02:36:26,768
all through high school
really, really was proud of me.

2159
02:36:26,873 --> 02:36:29,740
She said, "Everybody's throwing
their dreams into you...

2160
02:36:29,843 --> 02:36:33,279
but you got to throw
your own dreams into yourself. '"

2161
02:36:42,222 --> 02:36:45,282
When I gave her the diploma
after the graduation...

2162
02:36:45,391 --> 02:36:49,918
she was, like,
"This is it, one of my proudest moments. '"

2163
02:37:03,308 --> 02:37:05,435
My baby graduated.

2164
02:37:09,848 --> 02:37:12,817
Curtis always wanted to go to Marquette...

2165
02:37:12,918 --> 02:37:15,819
and his grades weren't
good enough for him to go...

2166
02:37:15,921 --> 02:37:19,913
and now it's like
he got the grades, you know?

2167
02:37:22,093 --> 02:37:25,256
Excuse me, Curtis.
You gonna give anybody else a chance?

2168
02:37:25,363 --> 02:37:28,423
What two countries
are we competing with for world trade?

2169
02:37:28,533 --> 02:37:31,969
Before Arthur can graduate,
he must pass summer school.

2170
02:37:32,069 --> 02:37:35,300
And for the first time in three years,
Shannon isn't there with him.

2171
02:37:35,406 --> 02:37:37,374
The other country, of course, we said-

2172
02:37:37,475 --> 02:37:41,275
he thought he could sell drugs
and don't get caught, you know.

2173
02:37:41,379 --> 02:37:43,279
But he found out the hard way.

2174
02:37:43,381 --> 02:37:45,213
And I told him, while
he was doing all that -

2175
02:37:45,214 --> 02:37:46,646
I wasn't hanging with Shannon then.

2176
02:37:46,751 --> 02:37:49,417
I was like, man, "Shannon,
you should stop, man.

2177
02:37:49,418 --> 02:37:50,777
Stop doing that stuff."

2178
02:37:54,224 --> 02:37:58,126
We always said we weren't
gonna never do no stuff like that.

2179
02:37:58,228 --> 02:38:02,130
We were just gonna go on
and graduate and go on to college.

2180
02:38:02,232 --> 02:38:05,599
But, you know, he had to be the one.

2181
02:38:16,045 --> 02:38:20,175
One week before his graduation,
Arthur is robbed at gunpoint.

2182
02:38:21,217 --> 02:38:24,914
At first I thought he was gonna shoot me
because I didn't have no money.

2183
02:38:25,955 --> 02:38:29,482
'Cause he kept asking me, "You got -
You got some money. Where your wallet at?"

2184
02:38:29,592 --> 02:38:31,873
Be like, "What you driving
a car like this for?"

2185
02:38:31,874 --> 02:38:33,688
I was, like, "I ain't got no wallet."

2186
02:38:36,832 --> 02:38:39,460
And then, you know,
he grabbed me and stuff, and I was-

2187
02:38:39,568 --> 02:38:43,937
and I was about to panic and stuff,
and I just calmed down.

2188
02:38:47,508 --> 02:38:50,944
I sit down and had a long
talk with him and his sister.

2189
02:38:51,045 --> 02:38:54,503
Someone pulled a pistol on her
right down the street from the house.

2190
02:38:55,617 --> 02:38:58,599
I said, "Do you all
understand what is going on

2191
02:38:58,600 --> 02:39:00,645
out here in these streets today?'"

2192
02:39:00,755 --> 02:39:05,192
Even with me, when I was out there -
you know, out there strung out -

2193
02:39:05,293 --> 02:39:09,024
you know, I looked for somebody
that seemed like they had something.

2194
02:39:10,632 --> 02:39:15,000
Hmm. After this, I -

2195
02:39:15,102 --> 02:39:19,266
I - I'm ready.
I'm ready to leave.

2196
02:39:19,373 --> 02:39:21,273
'Cause there ain't no -

2197
02:39:21,375 --> 02:39:25,402
Everybody up here going to jail
or-or either in drugs.

2198
02:39:26,446 --> 02:39:28,414
Or dead.

2199
02:40:05,451 --> 02:40:07,419
James Davis.

2200
02:40:19,130 --> 02:40:21,655
Arthur Agee.

2201
02:40:23,835 --> 02:40:27,601
Please hold your applause
so everyone can hear.

2202
02:40:27,706 --> 02:40:29,674
Christine Bowman.

2203
02:40:32,177 --> 02:40:34,145
Erica Byrd.

2204
02:40:37,082 --> 02:40:39,243
Sandra Crockett.

2205
02:40:41,018 --> 02:40:45,512
I never thought he would
get to the place where he's at now.

2206
02:40:47,658 --> 02:40:52,721
Arthur's self-esteem
was really drained from St. Joseph's.

2207
02:40:52,830 --> 02:40:55,390
I said, "Well, you are somebody.

2208
02:40:55,499 --> 02:40:58,263
"No matter where you go,
it's what you have in your heart...

2209
02:40:58,369 --> 02:41:01,099
that you're gonna go somewhere. '"

2210
02:41:13,950 --> 02:41:16,510
Come on.
Move out of the way, boy.

2211
02:41:20,790 --> 02:41:22,556
Everybody out there, there's gonna be

2212
02:41:22,557 --> 02:41:24,851
a party tonight. There's
gonna be a party tonight.

2213
02:41:24,961 --> 02:41:26,861
You know it.

2214
02:41:26,963 --> 02:41:29,659
These flame-broiled burgers -

2215
02:42:00,062 --> 02:42:01,962
It's scary, man. I'm telling you.

2216
02:42:02,064 --> 02:42:04,532
I'm telling you the truth.
Scary generation, man.

2217
02:42:05,767 --> 02:42:08,014
- I thought you might
hit me in my head, fool.

2218
02:42:08,015 --> 02:42:09,497
- I didn't hit you in your head.

2219
02:42:09,603 --> 02:42:11,628
To my son.

2220
02:42:11,739 --> 02:42:15,231
I hope you pursue all your dreams
and your desires...

2221
02:42:15,342 --> 02:42:17,310
that you have within you.

2222
02:42:17,411 --> 02:42:19,675
I love you very much.

2223
02:42:19,780 --> 02:42:23,443
- Ooh, that is so nice.
- Whatever.

2224
02:42:23,551 --> 02:42:26,042
Oh, no.!

2225
02:42:44,971 --> 02:42:47,235
God, we thank you
for this day, Lord.

2226
02:42:47,340 --> 02:42:49,934
And we ask you to
go with junior, Lord.

2227
02:42:50,043 --> 02:42:53,706
And we thank you, Lord. Go with him
as he try to better his education, Lord.

2228
02:42:53,813 --> 02:42:56,441
And we thank you for him
for coming this far.

2229
02:42:56,549 --> 02:42:58,540
We came this far by faith, Lord.

2230
02:42:58,651 --> 02:43:01,347
And we ask you, Father,
when he get in college, Lord...

2231
02:43:01,454 --> 02:43:03,649
to keep him, Lord-
keep him protected.

2232
02:43:03,756 --> 02:43:05,656
We thank you for him, Jesus.

2233
02:43:05,758 --> 02:43:08,726
- In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
- Amen.

2234
02:43:08,827 --> 02:43:12,854
Oh, you can cry like a river, girl.

2235
02:43:12,965 --> 02:43:15,490
You're crying so bad,
I won't even make fun of you.

2236
02:43:21,807 --> 02:43:23,775
Oh, God.

2237
02:43:41,993 --> 02:43:44,461
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'll miss you too.

2238
02:43:45,496 --> 02:43:47,521
I want you to be good, okay?

2239
02:43:47,632 --> 02:43:52,831
And don't, uh, get mixed up in
none of that old stuff that, uh, you know.

2240
02:43:52,937 --> 02:43:55,633
I done told you what to do.

2241
02:43:55,740 --> 02:43:59,039
Don't get no alcohol, no wine coolers.

2242
02:43:59,143 --> 02:44:01,737
None of that stuff.

2243
02:44:19,329 --> 02:44:21,297
Bye-bye.

2244
02:44:25,669 --> 02:44:29,662
I just hope he stay in there.
That's what worries me most.

2245
02:44:31,441 --> 02:44:35,206
Once he get in the door,
I want him to stay in there for four years.

2246
02:44:38,280 --> 02:44:40,475
Think he gonna make it?

2247
02:44:40,583 --> 02:44:42,551
You do?

2248
02:44:44,320 --> 02:44:46,788
I think he gonna make it.

2249
02:44:48,557 --> 02:44:50,525
Well, I hope so anyway.

2250
02:45:18,219 --> 02:45:22,383
When I was young-When I was little,
that's all I used to think about-the NBA.

2251
02:45:24,759 --> 02:45:27,091
If I set my mind, I can - I can go.

2252
02:45:27,195 --> 02:45:29,095
I can st - I can go.

2253
02:45:29,197 --> 02:45:31,528
Get in good college. I can go.

2254
02:45:32,633 --> 02:45:36,125
But if I don't, you know, I ain't gonna be
no drug dealer, you know...

2255
02:45:36,236 --> 02:45:39,137
cry about it,
come back and, you know...

2256
02:45:39,239 --> 02:45:42,504
stick up gas stations
or nothing like that, you know.

2257
02:45:42,609 --> 02:45:45,703
Probably go into comedian or architecture,
something like that.

2258
02:45:50,784 --> 02:45:53,156
You don't think that
you'll have the kind of

2259
02:45:53,169 --> 02:45:55,551
tough times like your
dad's been through?

2260
02:45:55,656 --> 02:45:58,352
No.

2261
02:45:58,458 --> 02:46:02,757
I can't say-I can't say that I will.
I can't say that I don't. I don't know.

2262
02:46:28,020 --> 02:46:29,812
Four years ago, that's all

2263
02:46:29,813 --> 02:46:32,718
I used to dream about
was playing in the NBA.

2264
02:46:32,824 --> 02:46:35,190
I don't really dream about it
like that anymore.

2265
02:46:36,227 --> 02:46:38,957
You know, even though...

2266
02:46:39,064 --> 02:46:41,999
I love playing basketball, but, you know...

2267
02:46:42,100 --> 02:46:44,830
I want to do other things
with my life too.

2268
02:46:44,936 --> 02:46:46,995
- Say, "hi, Daddy. '"
- Hi, Daddy.

2269
02:46:47,105 --> 02:46:49,403
- "how you doing?'"
- How you doing?

2270
02:46:49,507 --> 02:46:51,407
- Say, "I love you. '"
- I love you.

2271
02:46:52,510 --> 02:46:56,810
If I had to stop playing basketball
right now, I think I'd still be happy.

2272
02:46:56,915 --> 02:46:59,747
- I think I would.
- Thank you, Daddy.

2273
02:46:59,850 --> 02:47:02,580
- Where'd Daddy get to?
- Uh, Marquette.

2274
02:47:02,686 --> 02:47:04,654
Marquette?

2275
02:47:06,690 --> 02:47:09,056
That's why when
somebody say, you know...

2276
02:47:09,159 --> 02:47:10,286
"When you get to the NBA,

2277
02:47:10,287 --> 02:47:12,219
don't forget about me,
'"and all that stuff...

2278
02:47:12,329 --> 02:47:14,635
I should say to them,
"Well, if I don't make it,

2279
02:47:14,636 --> 02:47:16,231
watch you don't forget about me. '"

2
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,145
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

3
00:02:19,326 --> 00:02:21,601
Very good, Lieutenant.

4
00:03:13,324 --> 00:03:15,151
We made it.

5
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:20,323
I guess I was wrong.

6
00:03:20,456 --> 00:03:22,662
There was no danger at all.

7
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,143
Cordé.

8
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,434
Milady, I'm so sorry.

9
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:50,435
I've failed you, Senator.

10
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:51,684
No.

11
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:57,356
Milady, you're still in danger here.

12
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:07,083
- I shouldn't have come back.
- This vote is very important.

13
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,038
You did your duty.
Cordé did hers. Now, come.

14
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:15,001
Senator Amidala, please.

15
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:29,690
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.

16
00:04:30,484 --> 00:04:33,319
More and more star systems
are joining the separatists.

17
00:04:33,446 --> 00:04:35,237
If they do break away...

18
00:04:35,364 --> 00:04:38,614
I will not let this Republic
that has stood for a thousand years...

19
00:04:38,743 --> 00:04:40,782
be split in two.

20
00:04:40,911 --> 00:04:43,865
My negotiations will not fail.

21
00:04:44,206 --> 00:04:46,532
If they do, you must realize...

22
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:48,743
there aren't enough Jedi
to protect the Republic.

23
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,375
We're keepers of the peace,
not soldiers.

24
00:04:53,841 --> 00:04:55,549
Master Yoda...

25
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,180
do you think it will
really come to war?

26
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:04,975
The dark side clouds everything.

27
00:05:05,102 --> 00:05:10,060
Impossible to see the future is.

28
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:15,104
<i>The Loyalist Committee</i>
<i>has arrived, Your Honour.</i>

29
00:05:15,237 --> 00:05:16,237
Good.

30
00:05:18,783 --> 00:05:20,906
Send them in.

31
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:23,870
We will discuss this matter later.

32
00:05:28,084 --> 00:05:31,951
Senator Amidala, your tragedy
on the landing platform...

33
00:05:32,088 --> 00:05:33,961
terrible.

34
00:05:34,215 --> 00:05:37,833
Seeing you alive brings
warm feelings to my heart.

35
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:40,673
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?

36
00:05:40,805 --> 00:05:45,383
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

37
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,350
I think that Count Dooku
was behind it.

38
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,346
He is a political idealist,
not a murderer.

39
00:05:52,483 --> 00:05:55,437
You know, milady,
Count Dooku was once a Jedi.

40
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:59,021
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.

41
00:05:59,156 --> 00:06:01,694
But for certain, Senator...

42
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:05,658
in grave danger you are.

43
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:09,701
Master Jedi, may I suggest...

44
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:13,914
the senator be placed under
the protection of your graces?

45
00:06:14,046 --> 00:06:17,083
Do you really think that's a wise
decision under these stressful times?

46
00:06:17,216 --> 00:06:19,292
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe...

47
00:06:19,427 --> 00:06:21,752
The situation is that serious?

48
00:06:22,346 --> 00:06:24,303
No, but I do, Senator.

49
00:06:24,432 --> 00:06:27,765
I realize all too well
that additional security...

50
00:06:27,893 --> 00:06:31,345
might be disruptive for you...

51
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,150
but perhaps someone
you're familiar with.

52
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:38,267
An old friend, like Master Kenobi.

53
00:06:39,155 --> 00:06:40,649
That's possible.

54
00:06:40,781 --> 00:06:43,533
He's just returned
from a border dispute on Ansion.

55
00:06:44,702 --> 00:06:46,825
Do it for me, milady. Please?

56
00:06:46,954 --> 00:06:49,326
The thought of losing you...

57
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,123
is unbearable.

58
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:57,170
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.

59
00:06:57,298 --> 00:06:59,540
Thank you, Master Windu.

60
00:07:08,684 --> 00:07:12,433
- You seem a little on edge.
- Not at all.

61
00:07:12,563 --> 00:07:16,181
I haven't felt you this tense since
we fell into that nest of gundarks.

62
00:07:16,942 --> 00:07:18,900
You fell into that nightmare, Master...

63
00:07:19,028 --> 00:07:21,436
and I rescued you, remember?

64
00:07:21,947 --> 00:07:23,940
Oh... yes.

65
00:07:29,413 --> 00:07:33,458
You're sweating. Relax.
Take a deep breath.

66
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:36,660
I haven't seen her
in ten years, Master.

67
00:07:51,352 --> 00:07:54,057
Obi? Obi!

68
00:07:54,188 --> 00:07:57,853
- Mesa so smilen to seein yousa!
- Good to see you again, Jar Jar.

69
00:07:57,984 --> 00:07:59,941
Senator Padmé.

70
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:03,652
Mesa palos here!
Lookie, lookie, Senator.

71
00:08:03,781 --> 00:08:06,486
Desa Jedi arriven.

72
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:13,076
It's a great pleasure
to see you again, milady.

73
00:08:13,207 --> 00:08:15,663
It has been far too long,
Master Kenobi.

74
00:08:17,044 --> 00:08:18,455
Ani?

75
00:08:18,587 --> 00:08:21,873
- My goodness, you've grown.
- So have you.

76
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:24,380
Grown more beautiful, I mean.

77
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,179
Well, for a senator, I mean.

78
00:08:29,557 --> 00:08:32,677
Ani, you'll always be that little boy
I knew on Tatooine.

79
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,721
Our presence here will be invisible,
milady, I can assure you.

80
00:08:37,857 --> 00:08:40,264
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.

81
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:42,475
Queen Jamillia has been informed
of your assignment.

82
00:08:42,575 --> 00:08:44,693
I am grateful you are here,
Master Kenobi.

83
00:08:44,822 --> 00:08:47,574
The situation is more dangerous
than the senator will admit.

84
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,369
I don't need more security.
I need answers.

85
00:08:50,494 --> 00:08:52,701
I want to know
who's trying to kill me.

86
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:56,614
We are here to protect you,
Senator, not to start an investigation.

87
00:08:56,751 --> 00:08:59,123
We will find out
who's trying to kill you, Padmé.

88
00:08:59,253 --> 00:09:01,080
I promise you.

89
00:09:01,213 --> 00:09:03,918
We will not exceed our mandate,
my young Padawan learner.

90
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,967
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master, of course.

91
00:09:07,094 --> 00:09:09,585
We will not go through
this exercise again, Anakin...

92
00:09:09,722 --> 00:09:11,631
and you will pay attention
to my lead.

93
00:09:11,766 --> 00:09:13,842
- Why?
- What?

94
00:09:15,728 --> 00:09:19,429
Why else do you think we were assigned
to her if not to find the killer?

95
00:09:19,565 --> 00:09:22,815
Protection is a job
for local security, not Jedi.

96
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,779
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.

97
00:09:25,905 --> 00:09:29,155
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.

98
00:09:31,661 --> 00:09:34,661
And you will learn
your place, young one.

99
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:40,160
Perhaps with merely your presence...

100
00:09:40,294 --> 00:09:43,212
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.

101
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:45,912
Now, if you'll excuse me...

102
00:09:46,175 --> 00:09:47,883
I will retire.

103
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:51,301
I know I'll feel better
having you here.

104
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,553
I'll have an officer stationed
on every floor...

105
00:09:53,683 --> 00:09:55,841
and I'll be in the control centre
downstairs.

106
00:09:57,478 --> 00:10:00,479
Mesa busten wit happiness
seein yousa again, Ani.

107
00:10:00,606 --> 00:10:03,726
She hardly even
recognized me, Jar Jar.

108
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:08,278
I've thought about her
every day since we parted and...

109
00:10:09,657 --> 00:10:11,614
she's forgotten me completely.

110
00:10:11,742 --> 00:10:13,367
Shesa happy.

111
00:10:13,494 --> 00:10:15,866
Happier den mesa seein her
in a longo time.

112
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:19,781
You're focusing on the negative, Anakin.
Be mindful of your thoughts.

113
00:10:20,126 --> 00:10:22,533
She was pleased to see us.

114
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,627
Now, let's check the security.

115
00:10:33,597 --> 00:10:35,720
I hit the ship,
but they used a decoy.

116
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,092
We'll have to try something
more subtle this time, Zam.

117
00:10:38,227 --> 00:10:40,220
My client is getting impatient.

118
00:10:40,354 --> 00:10:43,189
Take these. Be careful.
They're very poisonous.

119
00:10:43,316 --> 00:10:46,731
And, Zam, there can be
no mistakes this time.

120
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,481
Captain Typho has
more than enough men downstairs.

121
00:10:52,616 --> 00:10:54,526
No assassin would try that way.

122
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:57,657
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.

123
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:02,042
I don't like just waiting here
for something to happen to her.

124
00:11:02,418 --> 00:11:05,668
- What's going on?
- She covered the cameras.

125
00:11:06,422 --> 00:11:08,415
I don't think she liked me
watching her.

126
00:11:08,549 --> 00:11:10,423
What is she thinking?

127
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:13,552
She programmed R2 to warn us
if there is an intruder.

128
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:16,253
There are many other ways
to kill a senator.

129
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:20,720
I know, but we also want to catch
this assassin, don't we, Master?

130
00:11:22,855 --> 00:11:24,931
You're using her as bait.

131
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:27,105
It was her idea.

132
00:11:27,234 --> 00:11:29,772
Don't worry.
No harm will come to her.

133
00:11:29,904 --> 00:11:32,858
I can sense everything
going on in that room.

134
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,232
Trust me.

135
00:11:35,368 --> 00:11:37,241
It's too risky.

136
00:11:37,745 --> 00:11:40,948
Besides, your senses aren't
that attuned, my young apprentice.

137
00:11:41,374 --> 00:11:43,366
And yours are?

138
00:11:45,586 --> 00:11:47,460
Possibly.

139
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:03,768
You look tired.

140
00:12:04,522 --> 00:12:06,479
I don't sleep well any more.

141
00:12:06,607 --> 00:12:09,098
Because of your mother?

142
00:12:14,281 --> 00:12:17,069
I don't know
why I keep dreaming about her.

143
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:21,738
Dreams pass in time.

144
00:12:23,332 --> 00:12:25,870
I'd much rather dream about Padmé.

145
00:12:26,002 --> 00:12:30,165
Just being around her again is...
intoxicating.

146
00:12:30,298 --> 00:12:32,753
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.
They betray you.

147
00:12:32,883 --> 00:12:35,172
You've made a commitment
to the Jedi order...

148
00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:37,342
a commitment not easily broken.

149
00:12:37,471 --> 00:12:40,223
And don't forget, she's a politician.
They're not to be trusted.

150
00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:42,923
She's not like the others
in the senate, Master.

151
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,183
It is my experience
that senators focus...

152
00:12:45,313 --> 00:12:48,183
only on pleasing those
who fund their campaigns...

153
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:52,476
and they're in no means scared of
forgetting the niceties of democracy...

154
00:12:52,611 --> 00:12:54,731
- in order to get those funds.
- Not another lecture.

155
00:12:54,905 --> 00:12:57,693
At least not
on the economics of politics.

156
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:56,044
And besides, you're generalizing.

157
00:13:56,175 --> 00:13:58,215
The chancellor doesn't appear
to be corrupt.

158
00:13:58,344 --> 00:13:59,968
Palpatine is a politician.

159
00:14:00,096 --> 00:14:02,717
I have observed
that he is very clever...

160
00:14:02,848 --> 00:14:06,798
in following the passions
and the prejudices of the senators.

161
00:14:06,936 --> 00:14:08,810
I think he's a good man...

162
00:14:08,938 --> 00:14:10,812
I sense it too.

163
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:30,001
Stay here!

164
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,329
Are you all right, milady?

165
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:09,987
What the...

166
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:20,293
<i>Jedi poo doo!</i>

167
00:16:22,154 --> 00:16:24,396
- What took you so long?
- Oh, you know, Master.

168
00:16:24,532 --> 00:16:27,402
- I couldn't find a speeder I liked...
- There he is.

169
00:16:27,535 --> 00:16:30,904
With the open cockpit
and the right speed capabilities.

170
00:16:31,038 --> 00:16:33,948
If you spent as long practising your
sabre techniques as you do your wit...

171
00:16:34,048 --> 00:16:35,678
you would rival Master Yoda
as a swordsman.

172
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:37,453
I thought I already did.

173
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:40,291
Only in your mind,
my very young apprentice.

174
00:17:08,784 --> 00:17:11,192
Pull up, Anakin. Pull up!

175
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:20,459
You know I don't like it
when you do that.

176
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:23,791
Sorry, Master.
I forgot you don't like flying.

177
00:17:23,924 --> 00:17:26,712
I don't mind flying,
but what you're doing is suicide!

178
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,993
Anakin! How many times
have I told you...

179
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,333
stay away from power couplings!

180
00:18:03,005 --> 00:18:04,334
That was good!

181
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:22,388
Where are you going?
He went that way.

182
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:24,485
Master, if we keep this chase
going any longer...

183
00:18:24,652 --> 00:18:26,644
that creep is gonna end up deep-fried...

184
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:31,026
and, personally, I'd like to find out
who he is and who he's working for.

185
00:18:31,158 --> 00:18:33,828
This is a short cut... I think.

186
00:19:01,647 --> 00:19:03,474
Well, you've lost him.

187
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:06,064
I'm deeply sorry, Master.

188
00:19:06,193 --> 00:19:08,067
That was some short cut, Anakin.

189
00:19:08,195 --> 00:19:10,603
He went completely the other way.

190
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,820
- Once again you've proved...
- If you'll excuse me.

191
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:17,901
I hate it when he does that.

192
00:21:46,937 --> 00:21:48,681
Anakin!

193
00:21:48,814 --> 00:21:51,602
- She went into the club, Master.
- Patience.

194
00:21:51,734 --> 00:21:55,233
- Use the Force. Think.
- Sorry, Master.

195
00:21:55,363 --> 00:21:58,114
- He went in there to hide, not to run.
- Yes, Master.

196
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,028
- Next time, try not to lose it.
- Yes, Master.

197
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,074
- This weapon is your life.
- I try, Master.

198
00:22:05,206 --> 00:22:07,875
Why do I get the feeling
you're going to be the death of me?

199
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,660
Don't say that, Master.

200
00:22:09,794 --> 00:22:11,833
You're the closest thing
I have to a father.

201
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:13,789
Then why don't you listen to me?

202
00:22:13,923 --> 00:22:15,500
I am trying.

203
00:22:27,645 --> 00:22:29,554
Can you see him?

204
00:22:29,689 --> 00:22:31,598
I think he is a she...

205
00:22:31,732 --> 00:22:34,402
and I think she is a changeling.

206
00:22:35,027 --> 00:22:37,649
In that case, be extra careful.

207
00:22:39,699 --> 00:22:42,106
- Go and find her.
- Where are you going, Master?

208
00:22:42,243 --> 00:22:43,702
For a drink.

209
00:22:54,297 --> 00:22:56,123
Thank you.

210
00:22:56,882 --> 00:23:00,298
- You wanna buy some death sticks?
- You don't want to sell me death sticks.

211
00:23:00,428 --> 00:23:02,337
I don't want to
sell you death sticks.

212
00:23:02,471 --> 00:23:04,547
You want to go home
and rethink your life.

213
00:23:04,682 --> 00:23:07,007
I want to go home
and rethink my life.

214
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:56,471
Easy.

215
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:58,732
Jedi business.
Go back to your drinks.

216
00:24:05,368 --> 00:24:07,989
Do you know who it was
you were trying to kill?

217
00:24:08,663 --> 00:24:10,454
It was a senator from Naboo.

218
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:13,202
- And who hired you?
- It was just a job.

219
00:24:14,335 --> 00:24:16,577
Who hired you? Tell us.

220
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,081
Tell us now!

221
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,877
It was a bounty hunter called...

222
00:24:28,182 --> 00:24:32,643
<i>Wee shahnit... sleemo.</i>

223
00:24:42,238 --> 00:24:44,065
Toxic dart.

224
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,545
Track down this bounty hunter
you must, Obi-Wan.

225
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:02,087
Most importantly,
find out who he's working for.

226
00:25:02,216 --> 00:25:06,084
What about Senator Amidala?
She will still need protecting.

227
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,138
Handle that your Padawan will.

228
00:25:10,891 --> 00:25:14,510
Anakin, escort the senator
back to her home planet of Naboo.

229
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:18,346
She'll be safer there.
And don't use registered transport.

230
00:25:18,482 --> 00:25:20,440
Travel as refugees.

231
00:25:20,568 --> 00:25:23,438
As the leader of the opposition,
it will be very difficult...

232
00:25:23,571 --> 00:25:25,943
to get Senator Amidala
to leave the capital.

233
00:25:26,907 --> 00:25:29,743
Until caught this killer is...

234
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:32,905
our judgement she must respect.

235
00:25:33,372 --> 00:25:35,448
Anakin, go to the senate...

236
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:38,750
and ask Chancellor Palpatine
to speak with her about this matter.

237
00:25:47,678 --> 00:25:49,587
I will talk with her.

238
00:25:49,722 --> 00:25:52,806
Senator Amidala will not refuse
an executive order.

239
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:55,092
I know her well enough
to assure you of that.

240
00:25:55,227 --> 00:25:57,267
Thank you, Your Excellency.

241
00:25:57,396 --> 00:26:00,730
And so, they've finally
given you an assignment.

242
00:26:01,901 --> 00:26:03,858
Your patience has paid off.

243
00:26:03,986 --> 00:26:06,275
Your guidance
more than my patience.

244
00:26:07,448 --> 00:26:09,773
You don't need guidance, Anakin.

245
00:26:11,118 --> 00:26:14,119
In time, you will learn
to trust your feelings.

246
00:26:16,082 --> 00:26:18,158
Then you will be invincible.

247
00:26:21,295 --> 00:26:23,169
I have said it many times:

248
00:26:23,297 --> 00:26:26,049
You are the most gifted Jedi
I have ever met.

249
00:26:26,175 --> 00:26:28,049
Thank you, Your Excellency.

250
00:26:28,177 --> 00:26:31,842
I see you becoming the greatest
of all the Jedi, Anakin...

251
00:26:31,973 --> 00:26:34,510
even more powerful
than Master Yoda.

252
00:26:39,689 --> 00:26:41,681
I am concerned for my Padawan.

253
00:26:41,816 --> 00:26:44,520
He is not ready to be given
this assignment on his own yet.

254
00:26:44,652 --> 00:26:47,855
The council is confident
in its decision, Obi-Wan.

255
00:26:47,989 --> 00:26:49,946
The boy has exceptional skills.

256
00:26:50,074 --> 00:26:52,482
But he still has much to learn, Master.

257
00:26:52,618 --> 00:26:56,034
His abilities have made him,
well, arrogant.

258
00:26:56,163 --> 00:26:58,121
Yes.

259
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:01,166
A flaw more and more common
among Jedi.

260
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,668
Too sure of themselves they are.

261
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:09,214
Even the older,
more experienced ones.

262
00:27:09,343 --> 00:27:12,878
Remember, Obi-Wan,
if the prophecy is true...

263
00:27:13,014 --> 00:27:16,632
your apprentice is the only one who can
bring the Force back into balance.

264
00:27:20,771 --> 00:27:23,558
I'm taking
an extended leave of absence.

265
00:27:23,691 --> 00:27:26,811
It will be your responsibility
to take my place in the senate.

266
00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:29,815
Representative Binks,
I know I can count on you.

267
00:27:29,947 --> 00:27:34,443
Mesa honoured to be taking on
dissa heavy burden.

268
00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:39,074
Mesa accept this
with muy, muy humility and...

269
00:27:39,206 --> 00:27:41,744
Jar Jar, I don't wish to hold you up.

270
00:27:41,876 --> 00:27:43,833
I'm sure you have
a great deal to do.

271
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:45,753
Of course.

272
00:27:46,047 --> 00:27:47,624
Milady.

273
00:27:52,219 --> 00:27:54,093
I do not like this idea of hiding.

274
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:56,254
Don't worry.

275
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,597
Now that the council
has ordered an investigation...

276
00:27:58,726 --> 00:28:01,395
it won't take Master Obi-Wan long
to find this bounty hunter.

277
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,391
I haven't worked for a year
to defeat the Military Creation Act...

278
00:28:04,523 --> 00:28:06,563
to not be here
when its fate is decided.

279
00:28:06,692 --> 00:28:08,732
Sometimes we must
let go of our pride...

280
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:11,399
and do what is requested of us.

281
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,938
Anakin, you've grown up.

282
00:28:15,826 --> 00:28:18,234
Master Obi-Wan manages
not to see it.

283
00:28:25,127 --> 00:28:27,749
Don't get me wrong.

284
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,671
Obi-Wan is a great mentor.

285
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:32,290
As wise as Master Yoda and...

286
00:28:32,426 --> 00:28:34,549
as powerful as Master Windu.

287
00:28:36,931 --> 00:28:39,338
I am truly thankful
to be his apprentice.

288
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,555
In some ways...
a lot of ways...

289
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:48,564
I'm really ahead of him.

290
00:28:49,318 --> 00:28:51,145
I'm ready for the trials...

291
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:54,647
but he feels that
I'm too unpredictable.

292
00:28:54,782 --> 00:28:56,691
He won't let me move on.

293
00:28:57,576 --> 00:28:59,818
- That must be frustrating.
- It's worse.

294
00:28:59,954 --> 00:29:02,741
He's overly critical.
He never listens.

295
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:05,199
He doesn't understand.

296
00:29:05,334 --> 00:29:07,410
It's not fair!

297
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:12,337
All mentors have a way of seeing
more of our faults than we would like.

298
00:29:12,466 --> 00:29:14,459
It's the only way we grow.

299
00:29:16,595 --> 00:29:18,006
I know.

300
00:29:18,973 --> 00:29:20,965
Anakin...

301
00:29:23,352 --> 00:29:25,843
don't try to grow up too fast.

302
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,889
But I am grown up.

303
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:32,066
You said it yourself.

304
00:29:33,195 --> 00:29:35,271
Please don't look at me like that.

305
00:29:36,282 --> 00:29:37,741
Why not?

306
00:29:37,867 --> 00:29:39,990
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

307
00:29:41,996 --> 00:29:43,953
Sorry, milady.

308
00:29:59,263 --> 00:30:02,015
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.

309
00:30:02,141 --> 00:30:05,177
Take good care of Dormé.
The threat's on you two now.

310
00:30:05,311 --> 00:30:07,268
He'll be safe with me.

311
00:30:11,692 --> 00:30:13,317
You'll be fine.

312
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:16,611
It's not me, milady.
I worry about you.

313
00:30:16,739 --> 00:30:19,064
What if they realize
you've left the capital?

314
00:30:20,242 --> 00:30:23,528
Well, then my Jedi protector
will have to prove how good he is.

315
00:30:23,663 --> 00:30:25,536
Anakin...

316
00:30:25,665 --> 00:30:28,749
don't do anything without first
consulting either myself or the council.

317
00:30:28,876 --> 00:30:30,785
Yes, Master.

318
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:34,454
I'll get to the bottom
of this plot quickly, milady.

319
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,499
You'll be back here in no time.

320
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:39,837
I'll be most grateful
for your speed, Master Jedi.

321
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,844
- It's time to go.
- I know.

322
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:44,464
Anakin, may the Force be with you.

323
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,640
May the Force be with you, Master.

324
00:30:58,114 --> 00:30:59,987
Suddenly I'm afraid.

325
00:31:00,116 --> 00:31:03,698
This is my first assignment on my own.
I am too.

326
00:31:06,122 --> 00:31:08,245
Don't worry.
We have R2 with us.

327
00:31:13,629 --> 00:31:16,167
I do hope he doesn't try
anything foolish.

328
00:31:16,924 --> 00:31:20,376
I'd be more concerned about her
doing something than him.

329
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,900
Someone to see ya, honey!

330
00:31:44,368 --> 00:31:46,242
Jedi, by the looks of him.

331
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,907
Obi-Wan!

332
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:51,279
Hello, Dex.

333
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:53,990
Take a seat.
I'll be right with ya.

334
00:31:56,422 --> 00:31:59,376
- You wanna cup o' jawa juice?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

335
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,213
Old buddy!

336
00:32:15,608 --> 00:32:18,525
So, my friend, what can I do for ya?

337
00:32:18,653 --> 00:32:20,479
You can tell me what this is.

338
00:32:21,989 --> 00:32:25,192
Well, whattaya know!

339
00:32:25,326 --> 00:32:27,698
I ain't seen one of these
since I was prospectin'...

340
00:32:27,828 --> 00:32:31,032
on Subterrel, beyond the outer rim.

341
00:32:31,165 --> 00:32:33,573
Can you tell me
where it came from?

342
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:36,663
This baby belongs to them cloners.

343
00:32:36,796 --> 00:32:41,090
What you got here
is a Kamino sabredart.

344
00:32:41,217 --> 00:32:44,171
I wonder why it didn't show up
in the analysis archives.

345
00:32:44,303 --> 00:32:47,553
It's these funny little cuts on the side
that give it away.

346
00:32:47,682 --> 00:32:51,596
Those analysis droids
only focus on symbols.

347
00:32:51,727 --> 00:32:53,969
I should think that you Jedi
would have more respect...

348
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:56,430
for the difference
between knowledge and...

349
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:59,233
wisdom.

350
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,353
Well, if droids could think...

351
00:33:01,487 --> 00:33:03,527
there'd be none of us here,
would there?

352
00:33:04,281 --> 00:33:06,498
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?

353
00:33:06,598 --> 00:33:08,533
No, no. It's beyond the outer rim.

354
00:33:08,661 --> 00:33:14,248
I'd say about 12 parsecs
outside the Rishi Maze.

355
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:18,918
Should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your archives.

356
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,589
These Kaminoans
keep to themselves.

357
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:27,589
They're cloners.
Damn good ones too.

358
00:33:28,764 --> 00:33:31,849
- Cloners. Are they friendly?
- Depends.

359
00:33:32,268 --> 00:33:34,177
Depends on what, Dex?

360
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:37,147
On how good your manners are...

361
00:33:37,273 --> 00:33:41,567
and how big your... pocketbook is.

362
00:33:52,413 --> 00:33:54,986
- Did you call for assistance?
- Yes, I did.

363
00:33:55,124 --> 00:33:57,247
Are you having a problem,
Master Kenobi?

364
00:33:57,376 --> 00:34:00,626
Yes, I'm looking for a planetary system
called Kamino.

365
00:34:00,755 --> 00:34:02,996
It doesn't show up
on the archive charts.

366
00:34:03,132 --> 00:34:07,426
Kamino. It's not a system
I'm familiar with.

367
00:34:07,553 --> 00:34:09,878
Are you sure you have
the right coordinates?

368
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:12,968
According to my information, it should
appear in this quadrant here...

369
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,176
just south of the Rishi Maze.

370
00:34:22,109 --> 00:34:25,443
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for...

371
00:34:25,571 --> 00:34:27,445
doesn't exist.

372
00:34:27,573 --> 00:34:30,823
Impossible.
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.

373
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:33,988
If an item does not appear
in our records...

374
00:34:34,121 --> 00:34:36,197
it does not exist.

375
00:34:57,979 --> 00:35:00,220
Hey, you! No droids!

376
00:35:00,606 --> 00:35:02,480
Get outta here!

377
00:35:09,323 --> 00:35:11,197
Thank you, R2.

378
00:35:11,993 --> 00:35:14,863
Must be difficult,
having sworn your life to the Jedi...

379
00:35:14,996 --> 00:35:18,863
not being able to visit the places
you like or do the things you like.

380
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,122
Or be with the people that I love.

381
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:24,079
Are you allowed to love?

382
00:35:24,213 --> 00:35:26,040
I thought that was forbidden
for a Jedi.

383
00:35:29,593 --> 00:35:31,882
Attachment is forbidden.

384
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:35,555
Possession is forbidden.

385
00:35:35,683 --> 00:35:39,266
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love...

386
00:35:39,395 --> 00:35:41,803
is central to a Jedi's life.

387
00:35:44,317 --> 00:35:48,646
So you might say that
we are encouraged to love.

388
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,689
You've changed so much.

389
00:35:50,823 --> 00:35:53,361
You haven't changed a bit.

390
00:35:53,492 --> 00:35:56,327
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.

391
00:36:09,008 --> 00:36:12,708
Reach out.
Sense the Force around you.

392
00:36:12,845 --> 00:36:15,514
Use your feelings you must.

393
00:36:19,935 --> 00:36:22,936
Younglings. Younglings!

394
00:36:23,064 --> 00:36:25,471
A visitor we have.

395
00:36:25,608 --> 00:36:28,478
Hello, Master Obi-Wan.

396
00:36:28,611 --> 00:36:30,022
Hello.

397
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:31,648
I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.

398
00:36:31,781 --> 00:36:34,106
What help can I be, Obi-Wan?

399
00:36:35,576 --> 00:36:38,447
I'm looking for a planet
described to me by an old friend.

400
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:41,699
I trust him, but the systems don't show
on the archive maps.

401
00:36:43,292 --> 00:36:46,127
Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has.

402
00:36:46,253 --> 00:36:48,211
How embarrassing!

403
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,668
Liam, the shades.

404
00:36:55,054 --> 00:36:57,462
Gather round the map reader.

405
00:36:57,598 --> 00:36:59,757
Clear your minds...

406
00:36:59,892 --> 00:37:03,343
and find Obi-Wan's
wayward planet we will.

407
00:37:04,563 --> 00:37:07,683
It ought to be here...

408
00:37:07,817 --> 00:37:09,690
but it isn't.

409
00:37:09,819 --> 00:37:13,235
Gravity is pulling all the stars
in the area towards this spot.

410
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,941
Gravity's silhouette remains...

411
00:37:17,076 --> 00:37:19,993
but the star and all the planets...

412
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:22,113
disappeared they have.

413
00:37:22,248 --> 00:37:24,371
How can this be?

414
00:37:25,584 --> 00:37:27,209
A thought?

415
00:37:28,129 --> 00:37:30,002
Anyone.

416
00:37:30,464 --> 00:37:31,875
Master?

417
00:37:32,008 --> 00:37:34,878
Because someone erased it
from the archive memory.

418
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:42,090
Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.

419
00:37:45,021 --> 00:37:47,227
The Padawan is right.

420
00:37:47,356 --> 00:37:50,393
Go to the centre of gravity's pull...

421
00:37:50,526 --> 00:37:53,977
and find your planet you will.

422
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,411
The data must have been erased.

423
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:07,575
But who could empty information from
the archives? Isn't that impossible?

424
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:11,079
Dangerous and disturbing
this puzzle is.

425
00:38:11,213 --> 00:38:15,543
Only a Jedi
could have erased those files.

426
00:38:15,676 --> 00:38:19,092
But who and why, harder to answer.

427
00:38:20,181 --> 00:38:23,016
Meditate on this I will.

428
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:50,164
I wasn't the youngest queen
ever elected...

429
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:53,877
but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.

430
00:38:54,006 --> 00:38:55,915
I'm not sure I was ready.

431
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,588
The people you served
thought you did a good job.

432
00:38:59,011 --> 00:39:01,085
I heard they even tried
to amend the constitution...

433
00:39:01,185 --> 00:39:03,220
so you could stay in office.

434
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:05,804
I was relieved
when my two terms were up.

435
00:39:05,935 --> 00:39:09,600
But when the queen asked me
to serve as senator...

436
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,723
I couldn't refuse her.

437
00:39:12,024 --> 00:39:15,358
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.

438
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,611
I'm glad that you chose to serve.

439
00:39:26,622 --> 00:39:30,157
If the senate votes to create an army,
it's sure to push us into a civil war.

440
00:39:30,293 --> 00:39:32,119
It's unthinkable!

441
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:35,622
There hasn't been a full-scale war
since the formation of the Republic.

442
00:39:35,756 --> 00:39:38,212
Do you see any way
through negotiations...

443
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:40,418
to bring the separatists
back into the Republic?

444
00:39:40,553 --> 00:39:42,711
Not if they feel threatened.

445
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:46,180
They'll turn to the Trade Federations
or the Commerce Guilds for help.

446
00:39:46,309 --> 00:39:48,266
It's outrageous...

447
00:39:48,394 --> 00:39:50,636
but after four trials
in the Supreme Court...

448
00:39:50,771 --> 00:39:54,555
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy
of the Trade Federation.

449
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:58,690
I fear the senate is powerless
to resolve this crisis.

450
00:40:00,823 --> 00:40:02,981
We must keep our faith
in the Republic.

451
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:13,918
The day we stop believing democracy
can work is the day we lose it.

452
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:16,714
Let's pray that day never comes.

453
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:19,508
In the meantime,
we must consider your own safety.

454
00:40:20,343 --> 00:40:22,584
What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?

455
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,053
Anakin's not a Jedi yet.
He's still a Padawan learner.

456
00:40:26,182 --> 00:40:28,009
- But I was thinking...
- Hold on a minute.

457
00:40:28,142 --> 00:40:29,387
Excuse me.

458
00:40:29,518 --> 00:40:31,926
I was thinking I would stay
in the lake country.

459
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:34,269
There are some places up there
that are very isolated.

460
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:37,435
Excuse me. I'm in charge
of security here, milady.

461
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:41,189
And this is my home. I know it
very well. That is why we're here.

462
00:40:41,322 --> 00:40:43,279
I think it would be wise...

463
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,779
if you took advantage
of my knowledge in this instance.

464
00:40:47,161 --> 00:40:49,070
Sorry, milady.

465
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:54,414
Perfect. It's settled, then.

466
00:41:08,391 --> 00:41:11,095
There it is, R4,
right where it should be.

467
00:41:11,227 --> 00:41:13,054
Our missing planet Kamino.

468
00:41:51,225 --> 00:41:53,099
Master Jedi.

469
00:41:54,228 --> 00:41:56,553
The prime minister is expecting you.

470
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:00,187
- I'm expected?
- Of course.

471
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,352
He is anxious to meet you.

472
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:05,646
After all these years...

473
00:42:05,781 --> 00:42:09,364
we were beginning to think
you weren't coming.

474
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:11,700
Now, please, this way.

475
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:26,964
May I present Lama Su...

476
00:42:27,094 --> 00:42:29,134
prime minister of Kamino.

477
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,929
And this is Master Jedi...

478
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:35,057
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

479
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:38,471
I trust you're going
to enjoy your stay.

480
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,898
Please.

481
00:42:43,569 --> 00:42:45,728
And now to business.

482
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:49,777
You will be delighted to hear
that we are on schedule.

483
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,784
200,000 units are ready...

484
00:42:52,912 --> 00:42:55,237
with a million more
well on the way.

485
00:42:56,415 --> 00:42:58,324
That's good news.

486
00:42:58,459 --> 00:43:01,579
Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas...

487
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:05,046
that his order will be met on time.

488
00:43:05,174 --> 00:43:07,131
I'm sorry. Master...

489
00:43:08,302 --> 00:43:10,840
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still...

490
00:43:10,972 --> 00:43:14,091
a leading member of the Jedi Council,
is he not?

491
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:18,009
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed
almost ten years ago.

492
00:43:19,647 --> 00:43:21,972
I'm so sorry to hear that.

493
00:43:22,108 --> 00:43:26,355
But I'm sure he would have been proud
of the army we've built for him.

494
00:43:26,487 --> 00:43:28,812
The army?

495
00:43:28,948 --> 00:43:32,566
Yes, a clone army, and I must say...

496
00:43:32,702 --> 00:43:34,908
one of the finest we've ever created.

497
00:43:35,037 --> 00:43:36,994
Tell me, Prime Minister...

498
00:43:37,123 --> 00:43:39,578
when my master first contacted you
about the army...

499
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:41,832
did he say who it was for?

500
00:43:41,961 --> 00:43:43,953
Of course he did.

501
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:46,757
This army is for the Republic.

502
00:43:47,633 --> 00:43:51,216
But you must be anxious
to inspect the units for yourself.

503
00:43:52,805 --> 00:43:54,845
That's why I'm here.

504
00:44:15,703 --> 00:44:17,826
We used to come here
for school retreat.

505
00:44:19,582 --> 00:44:21,658
We would swim
to that island every day.

506
00:44:23,002 --> 00:44:24,959
I love the water.

507
00:44:29,717 --> 00:44:33,335
We used to lie out on the sand
and let the sun dry us...

508
00:44:33,846 --> 00:44:36,800
and try to guess the names
of the birds singing.

509
00:44:39,685 --> 00:44:41,678
I don't like sand.

510
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,145
It's coarse and rough and irritating...

511
00:44:46,567 --> 00:44:48,524
and it gets everywhere.

512
00:44:50,738 --> 00:44:52,777
Not like here.

513
00:44:53,407 --> 00:44:55,364
Here, everything is soft...

514
00:44:57,536 --> 00:44:59,695
and smooth.

515
00:45:36,283 --> 00:45:37,943
No.

516
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:40,659
I shouldn't have done that.

517
00:45:42,415 --> 00:45:44,372
I'm sorry.

518
00:45:57,972 --> 00:45:59,596
Very impressive.

519
00:45:59,724 --> 00:46:01,847
I'd hoped you would be pleased.

520
00:46:04,979 --> 00:46:07,470
Clones can think creatively.

521
00:46:07,606 --> 00:46:11,474
You will find that they are
immensely superior to droids.

522
00:46:15,489 --> 00:46:20,650
We take great pride in our combat
education and training programmes.

523
00:46:20,786 --> 00:46:24,120
This group was created
about five years ago.

524
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:26,288
You mentioned growth acceleration.

525
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:28,326
Oh, yes, it's essential.

526
00:46:28,461 --> 00:46:31,462
Otherwise, a mature clone
would take a lifetime to grow.

527
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:34,162
Now we can do it in half the time.

528
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,921
I see.

529
00:46:37,053 --> 00:46:38,926
They are totally obedient...

530
00:46:39,055 --> 00:46:41,724
taking any order without question.

531
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:43,889
We modified their genetic structure...

532
00:46:44,018 --> 00:46:47,221
to make them less independent
than the original host.

533
00:46:47,355 --> 00:46:49,893
And who was the original host?

534
00:46:50,024 --> 00:46:52,100
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.

535
00:46:53,694 --> 00:46:55,770
And where is this bounty hunter now?

536
00:46:55,905 --> 00:46:58,028
Oh, we keep him here.

537
00:47:00,701 --> 00:47:03,536
Apart from his pay,
which is considerable...

538
00:47:03,663 --> 00:47:06,118
Fett demanded only one thing:

539
00:47:06,248 --> 00:47:08,822
An unaltered clone for himself.

540
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,367
- Curious, isn't it?
- "Unaltered"?

541
00:47:11,504 --> 00:47:13,995
Pure genetic replication.

542
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:17,251
No tampering with the structure
to make it more docile...

543
00:47:17,385 --> 00:47:19,923
and no growth acceleration.

544
00:47:20,054 --> 00:47:23,304
I should very much like
to meet this Jango Fett.

545
00:47:23,432 --> 00:47:26,682
I would be very happy
to arrange it for you.

546
00:47:44,286 --> 00:47:47,074
Magnificent, aren't they?

547
00:47:53,212 --> 00:47:55,039
I don't know.

548
00:47:56,257 --> 00:47:58,415
Sure you do.
You just don't want to tell me.

549
00:47:58,551 --> 00:48:00,876
You gonna use one of your
Jedi mind tricks on me?

550
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:03,088
They only work on the weak-minded.

551
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:06,140
All right.

552
00:48:06,267 --> 00:48:08,425
I was 12.
His name was Palo.

553
00:48:08,561 --> 00:48:11,016
We were both
in the Legislative Youth Programme.

554
00:48:11,147 --> 00:48:14,183
He was a few years older than I.
Very cute.

555
00:48:14,317 --> 00:48:16,642
Dark, curly hair.
Dreamy eyes.

556
00:48:16,777 --> 00:48:18,770
All right, I get the picture.

557
00:48:19,155 --> 00:48:21,028
Whatever happened to him?

558
00:48:21,157 --> 00:48:23,861
I went into public service.
He went on to become an artist.

559
00:48:23,993 --> 00:48:26,032
Maybe he was the smart one.

560
00:48:26,162 --> 00:48:28,404
You really don't like
politicians, do you?

561
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:30,662
I like two or three...

562
00:48:30,791 --> 00:48:32,867
but I'm not really sure
about one of them.

563
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:38,957
I don't think the system works.

564
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,755
How would you have it work?

565
00:48:42,303 --> 00:48:46,087
We need a system where the politicians
sit down and discuss the problem...

566
00:48:46,557 --> 00:48:49,048
agree what's in the best interest
of all the people...

567
00:48:49,185 --> 00:48:51,012
and then do it.

568
00:48:51,145 --> 00:48:52,888
That's exactly what we do.

569
00:48:53,022 --> 00:48:55,015
The trouble is that people
don't always agree.

570
00:48:55,149 --> 00:48:57,023
Well, then they should be made to.

571
00:48:57,151 --> 00:49:00,187
- By whom? Who's gonna make them?
- I don't know. Someone.

572
00:49:00,321 --> 00:49:02,360
- You?
- Of course not me.

573
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:05,444
- But someone.
- Someone wise.

574
00:49:05,576 --> 00:49:09,360
Sounds an awful lot
like a dictatorship to me.

575
00:49:10,873 --> 00:49:13,115
Well, if it works.

576
00:49:20,216 --> 00:49:22,007
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

577
00:49:22,134 --> 00:49:24,672
I'd be much too frightened
to tease a senator.

578
00:50:03,759 --> 00:50:06,250
Ani, are you all right?

579
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:45,626
Boba, is your father here?

580
00:50:46,677 --> 00:50:47,677
Yep.

581
00:50:47,803 --> 00:50:49,843
May we see him?

582
00:50:50,765 --> 00:50:52,757
Sure.

583
00:50:54,393 --> 00:50:56,516
Dad, Taun We's here.

584
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,156
Jango, welcome back.

585
00:51:12,495 --> 00:51:14,404
Was your trip productive?

586
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:16,448
Fairly.

587
00:51:16,582 --> 00:51:20,366
This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.

588
00:51:20,503 --> 00:51:23,290
He's come to check on our progress.

589
00:51:23,631 --> 00:51:26,501
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.

590
00:51:26,634 --> 00:51:29,635
I'm just a simple man trying
to make my way in the universe.

591
00:51:29,762 --> 00:51:33,427
Ever made your way as far
into the interior as Coruscant?

592
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:36,431
- Once or twice.
- Recently?

593
00:51:38,604 --> 00:51:40,264
Possibly.

594
00:51:40,398 --> 00:51:42,474
Then you must know
Master Sifo-Dyas.

595
00:51:47,113 --> 00:51:49,105
Boba, <i>rood eht so-heeck.</i>

596
00:51:50,324 --> 00:51:51,735
Master who?

597
00:51:54,203 --> 00:51:55,781
Sifo-Dyas.

598
00:51:55,913 --> 00:51:58,534
Is he not the Jedi
who hired you for this job?

599
00:52:01,502 --> 00:52:03,376
Never heard of him.

600
00:52:06,299 --> 00:52:07,378
Really?

601
00:52:08,509 --> 00:52:12,673
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus
on one of the moons of Bogden.

602
00:52:12,805 --> 00:52:14,216
Curious.

603
00:52:18,269 --> 00:52:20,475
Do you like your army?

604
00:52:21,314 --> 00:52:23,271
I look forward
to seeing them in action.

605
00:52:24,692 --> 00:52:27,895
They'll do their job well.
I'll guarantee that.

606
00:52:28,029 --> 00:52:30,152
Thank you for your time, Jango.

607
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:34,025
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

608
00:52:53,429 --> 00:52:55,671
What is it, Dad?

609
00:52:57,058 --> 00:52:59,050
Pack your things.
We're leaving.

610
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:08,275
And when I got to them,
we went into aggressive negotiations.

611
00:53:08,402 --> 00:53:10,442
"Aggressive negotiations"?
What's that?

612
00:53:10,863 --> 00:53:14,030
Well, negotiations with a lightsabre.

613
00:53:27,046 --> 00:53:30,166
If Master Obi-Wan caught me
doing this, he'd be very grumpy.

614
00:53:59,537 --> 00:54:01,743
From the moment I met you...

615
00:54:02,873 --> 00:54:05,032
all those years ago...

616
00:54:05,459 --> 00:54:08,460
not a day has gone by
when I haven't thought of you.

617
00:54:11,215 --> 00:54:13,587
And now that I'm with you again...

618
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,336
I'm in agony.

619
00:54:19,765 --> 00:54:23,597
The closer I get to you,
the worse it gets.

620
00:54:23,728 --> 00:54:26,135
The thought of not being with you...

621
00:54:27,023 --> 00:54:28,932
I can't breathe.

622
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:34,729
I'm haunted by the kiss...

623
00:54:34,864 --> 00:54:37,818
that you should never have given me.

624
00:54:38,284 --> 00:54:40,573
My heart is beating...

625
00:54:40,703 --> 00:54:43,620
hoping that that kiss
will not become a scar.

626
00:54:45,833 --> 00:54:48,704
You are in my very soul...

627
00:54:48,836 --> 00:54:50,876
tormenting me.

628
00:54:53,341 --> 00:54:56,840
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.

629
00:55:07,813 --> 00:55:11,396
If you are suffering
as much as I am, please, tell me.

630
00:55:13,277 --> 00:55:15,151
I can't.

631
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,317
We can't.
It's... just not possible.

632
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:22,404
Anything is possible, Padmé.
Listen to me.

633
00:55:22,536 --> 00:55:24,576
No, you listen.

634
00:55:25,206 --> 00:55:28,788
We live in a real world.
Come back to it.

635
00:55:28,918 --> 00:55:32,583
You're studying to become a Jedi.
I'm a senator.

636
00:55:34,507 --> 00:55:36,962
If you follow your thoughts
through to conclusion...

637
00:55:37,093 --> 00:55:39,548
it'll take us to a place
we cannot go...

638
00:55:40,846 --> 00:55:43,053
regardless of the way
we feel about each other.

639
00:55:43,182 --> 00:55:45,175
Then you do feel something.

640
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:48,310
I will not let you give up
your future for me.

641
00:55:48,437 --> 00:55:50,596
You are asking me to be rational.

642
00:55:51,732 --> 00:55:53,974
That is something
I know I cannot do.

643
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:58,736
Believe me, I wish that
I could just wish away my feelings...

644
00:55:58,864 --> 00:56:00,857
but I can't.

645
00:56:01,826 --> 00:56:04,530
I will not give in to this.

646
00:56:11,669 --> 00:56:13,875
Well, you know...

647
00:56:14,005 --> 00:56:16,792
it wouldn't have to be that way.

648
00:56:16,924 --> 00:56:19,759
We could keep it a secret.

649
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:23,177
We'd be living a lie...

650
00:56:23,306 --> 00:56:25,594
one we couldn't keep
even if we wanted to.

651
00:56:26,726 --> 00:56:28,967
I couldn't do that.

652
00:56:29,103 --> 00:56:31,974
Could you, Anakin?
Could you live like that?

653
00:56:33,941 --> 00:56:36,942
No. You're right.

654
00:56:38,446 --> 00:56:40,403
It would destroy us.

655
00:56:47,913 --> 00:56:51,781
Tell your council that
the first battalions are ready.

656
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:55,294
And remind them,
if they need more troops...

657
00:56:55,421 --> 00:56:58,541
it will take more time to grow them.

658
00:56:58,674 --> 00:57:00,418
I won't forget, and thank you.

659
00:57:00,551 --> 00:57:02,378
Thank you.

660
00:57:19,403 --> 00:57:20,779
R4!

661
00:57:20,905 --> 00:57:24,190
Scramble code five to Coruscant,
care of the old folks' home!

662
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:34,075
<i>I have successfully made contact</i>
<i>with the prime minister of Kamino.</i>

663
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:38,077
<i>They are using a bounty hunter named</i>
<i>Jango Fett to create a clone army.</i>

664
00:57:38,214 --> 00:57:40,669
<i>I have a strong feeling</i>
<i>that this bounty hunter...</i>

665
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,876
<i>is the assassin we are looking for.</i>

666
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:44,967
Do you think these cloners
are involved...

667
00:57:45,096 --> 00:57:47,135
in the plot to assassinate
Senator Amidala?

668
00:57:47,264 --> 00:57:50,135
<i>No, Master.</i>
<i>There appears to be no motive.</i>

669
00:57:50,267 --> 00:57:53,138
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan.

670
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:56,224
Clear your mind must be...

671
00:57:56,357 --> 00:58:00,520
if you are to discover
the real villains behind this plot.

672
00:58:00,653 --> 00:58:02,480
<i>Yes, Master.</i>

673
00:58:02,613 --> 00:58:05,650
<i>They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed</i>
<i>an order for a clone army...</i>

674
00:58:05,783 --> 00:58:09,366
<i>at the request of the senate</i>
<i>almost ten years ago.</i>

675
00:58:12,248 --> 00:58:15,083
<i>I was under the impression</i>
<i>he was killed before that.</i>

676
00:58:15,209 --> 00:58:18,708
<i>Did the council ever authorize</i>
<i>the creation of a clone army?</i>

677
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:20,711
No. Whoever placed that order...

678
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:23,082
did not have the authorization
of the Jedi Council.

679
00:58:23,217 --> 00:58:26,835
Bring him here.
Question him we will.

680
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:31,051
<i>Yes, Master.</i>
<i>I will report back when I have him.</i>

681
00:58:32,768 --> 00:58:36,303
Blind we are if creation
of this clone army...

682
00:58:36,439 --> 00:58:38,562
we could not see.

683
00:58:41,944 --> 00:58:44,103
I think it is time
we informed the senate...

684
00:58:44,238 --> 00:58:46,278
that our ability to use
the Force has diminished.

685
00:58:47,158 --> 00:58:51,487
Only the dark lord of the Sith
knows of our weakness.

686
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:53,862
If informed the senate is...

687
00:58:53,998 --> 00:58:56,453
multiply our adversaries will.

688
00:58:58,085 --> 00:58:59,710
No.

689
00:59:03,174 --> 00:59:05,131
Mom, no.

690
00:59:33,746 --> 00:59:35,952
Don't go.

691
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,957
I don't want to disturb you.

692
00:59:41,295 --> 00:59:43,252
Your presence is soothing.

693
00:59:46,175 --> 00:59:48,251
You had another nightmare last night.

694
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:51,842
Jedi don't have nightmares.

695
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:54,382
I heard you.

696
00:59:59,313 --> 01:00:01,306
I saw my mother.

697
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:06,394
She is suffering, Padmé.

698
01:00:08,864 --> 01:00:12,068
I saw her as clearly as I see you now.

699
01:00:23,379 --> 01:00:25,917
She is in pain.

700
01:00:27,008 --> 01:00:30,377
I know I'm disobeying my mandate
to protect you, Senator...

701
01:00:30,511 --> 01:00:32,504
but I have to go.

702
01:00:35,474 --> 01:00:37,467
I have to help her.

703
01:00:39,186 --> 01:00:41,096
I'll go with you.

704
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:43,472
I'm sorry.
I don't have a choice.

705
01:00:54,577 --> 01:00:56,451
Dad, look!

706
01:00:57,079 --> 01:00:59,487
Boba, get on board!

707
01:02:15,783 --> 01:02:17,491
Oh, not good.

708
01:04:27,081 --> 01:04:28,492
Wait right there.

709
01:04:28,624 --> 01:04:30,617
Okey-okey.

710
01:04:33,004 --> 01:04:34,664
<i>Chut-chut,</i> Watto.

711
01:04:36,757 --> 01:04:38,916
Let me help you with that.

712
01:04:40,094 --> 01:04:43,380
What? What do you want?

713
01:04:43,514 --> 01:04:45,970
Wait! You're a Jedi!

714
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:49,267
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

715
01:04:54,984 --> 01:04:57,142
I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

716
01:04:59,947 --> 01:05:01,572
Ani?

717
01:05:03,492 --> 01:05:05,236
Little Ani?

718
01:05:08,205 --> 01:05:10,163
Nahhh.

719
01:05:11,959 --> 01:05:14,664
You are Ani! It is you!

720
01:05:16,088 --> 01:05:19,338
You sure sprouted, huh?

721
01:05:20,176 --> 01:05:22,714
A Jedi! Whattaya know!

722
01:05:25,973 --> 01:05:29,841
Maybe you could help with some
deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.

723
01:05:29,977 --> 01:05:31,436
My mother.

724
01:05:31,562 --> 01:05:34,053
Oh, yeah. Shmi.

725
01:05:35,524 --> 01:05:38,728
She's not mine-a no more-a.
I sold her.

726
01:05:38,861 --> 01:05:41,150
- You sold her?
- Years ago.

727
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:44,364
Sorry, Ani, but you know,
business is business.

728
01:05:45,493 --> 01:05:49,241
I sold her to a moisture farmer
named Lars.

729
01:05:49,372 --> 01:05:51,364
At least I think it was Lars.

730
01:05:51,499 --> 01:05:54,998
Believe it or not, I heard
he freed her and married her!

731
01:05:55,127 --> 01:05:57,416
Can ya beat that, eh?

732
01:05:59,924 --> 01:06:01,963
Do you know where they are now?

733
01:06:03,052 --> 01:06:04,961
Long way from here.

734
01:06:05,096 --> 01:06:09,556
Someplace over on the other side
of Mos Eisley, I think.

735
01:06:09,684 --> 01:06:11,676
I'd like to know.

736
01:06:13,354 --> 01:06:16,106
Sure. Absolutely!

737
01:06:17,191 --> 01:06:19,231
Let's go look at my records, huh?

738
01:06:47,635 --> 01:06:50,457
Dad!
I think we're being tracked!

739
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:54,006
He must have put
a homing device on our hull.

740
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:56,377
Hang on, son.
We'll move into the asteroid field...

741
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:59,348
and we'll have
a couple of surprises for him.

742
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,317
Seismic charges!

743
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:13,774
Stand by.

744
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:41,766
He doesn't seem
to take a hint, this guy.

745
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:01,618
Watch out!

746
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:24,094
Get him, Dad! Fire!

747
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:28,557
Blast! This is why I hate flying!

748
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:50,119
We got him!

749
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:52,244
We'll just have to finish him.

750
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:21,731
R4, prepare to jettison
the spare part canisters.

751
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:28,497
Fire them now!

752
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:43,132
We won't be seeing him again.

753
01:10:17,005 --> 01:10:19,674
Well, R4, I think
we've waited long enough.

754
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:44,187
There's an unusual concentration
of Federation ships over there, R4.

755
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,269
Stay with the ship, R2.

756
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:40,786
Hello. How might I be
of service? I am C...

757
01:11:40,922 --> 01:11:42,796
3PO?

758
01:11:44,676 --> 01:11:46,503
The maker!

759
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:48,261
Master Ani!

760
01:11:48,388 --> 01:11:51,175
I knew you would return.
I knew it!

761
01:11:51,308 --> 01:11:53,015
And Miss Padmé. Oh, my.

762
01:11:53,143 --> 01:11:54,720
Hello, 3PO.

763
01:11:54,853 --> 01:11:58,720
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.

764
01:11:58,857 --> 01:12:00,814
I've come to see my mother.

765
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:04,692
I think perhaps
we'd better go indoors.

766
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:12,153
Master Owen, might I present
two most important visitors.

767
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,576
I'm Anakin Skywalker.

768
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:17,457
Owen Lars.

769
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:19,742
- This is my girlfriend, Beru.
- Hello.

770
01:12:19,878 --> 01:12:21,870
I'm Padmé.

771
01:12:22,255 --> 01:12:24,627
I guess I'm your stepbrother.

772
01:12:24,758 --> 01:12:27,628
I had a feeling
you might show up someday.

773
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:30,136
Is my mother here?

774
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:31,971
No, she's not.

775
01:12:33,183 --> 01:12:34,891
Cliegg Lars.

776
01:12:35,018 --> 01:12:37,011
Shmi is my wife.

777
01:12:38,146 --> 01:12:41,147
We should go inside.
We have a lot to talk about.

778
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:51,866
It was just before dawn.
They came out of nowhere.

779
01:12:51,993 --> 01:12:54,864
A hunting party of Tusken Raiders.

780
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:58,743
Your mother had gone out early,
like she always did...

781
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:02,244
to pick mushrooms
that grow on the vaporators.

782
01:13:02,963 --> 01:13:06,497
From the tracks,
she was about halfway home...

783
01:13:06,633 --> 01:13:08,507
when they took her.

784
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:12,176
Those Tuskens walk like men...

785
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:16,884
but they're vicious, mindless monsters.

786
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:21,765
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.

787
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:26,860
I'd be out there with them,
but after I lost my leg...

788
01:13:26,987 --> 01:13:32,610
I just couldn't ride any more
until I heal.

789
01:13:33,493 --> 01:13:35,450
I don't want to give up on her...

790
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:38,414
but she's been gone a month.

791
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:41,541
There's little hope
she's lasted this long.

792
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:48,296
Where are you going?

793
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,840
To find my mother.

794
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:54,888
Your mother's dead, son.
Accept it.

795
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:20,032
You're gonna have to stay here.

796
01:14:20,165 --> 01:14:22,834
These are good people, Padmé.
You'll be safe.

797
01:14:35,472 --> 01:14:37,429
I won't be long.

798
01:16:26,416 --> 01:16:28,409
We must persuade
the Commerce Guild...

799
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,915
and the Corporate Alliance
to sign the treaty.

800
01:16:31,046 --> 01:16:33,833
What about the senator
from Naboo?

801
01:16:34,466 --> 01:16:36,505
Is she dead yet?

802
01:16:37,218 --> 01:16:41,133
I am not signing your treaty
until I have her head on my desk.

803
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:43,553
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.

804
01:16:43,683 --> 01:16:46,720
With these new battle droids
we've built for you...

805
01:16:46,853 --> 01:16:50,020
you'll have the finest army
in the galaxy.

806
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:02,824
As I explained to you earlier...

807
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:06,156
I am quite convinced
that 10,000 more systems...

808
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:09,076
will rally to our cause
with your support, gentlemen.

809
01:17:10,043 --> 01:17:12,960
What you are proposing
could be construed as treason.

810
01:17:13,922 --> 01:17:15,630
The Techno Union army...

811
01:17:18,885 --> 01:17:21,637
is at your disposal, Count.

812
01:17:22,514 --> 01:17:26,013
The Banking Clan will sign your treaty.

813
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:28,016
Good. Very good.

814
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:32,561
Our friends from the Trade Federation
have pledged their support...

815
01:17:32,941 --> 01:17:35,396
and when their battle droids
are combined with yours...

816
01:17:35,652 --> 01:17:38,688
we shall have an army
greater than any in the galaxy.

817
01:17:39,531 --> 01:17:42,236
The Jedi will be overwhelmed.

818
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:47,110
The Republic will agree
to any demands we make.

819
01:18:47,974 --> 01:18:49,967
Mom?

820
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:54,352
Ani?

821
01:18:55,607 --> 01:18:57,398
Ani?

822
01:18:58,652 --> 01:19:00,276
Is it you?

823
01:19:00,403 --> 01:19:03,986
I'm here, Mom. You're safe.

824
01:19:10,372 --> 01:19:13,326
You look so handsome.

825
01:19:16,753 --> 01:19:18,829
My son.

826
01:19:18,964 --> 01:19:21,715
My grown-up son.

827
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:25,501
I'm so proud of you, Ani.

828
01:19:25,637 --> 01:19:27,546
I missed you.

829
01:19:30,308 --> 01:19:32,384
Now I am complete.

830
01:19:38,441 --> 01:19:41,442
I love y...

831
01:19:42,654 --> 01:19:45,774
Stay with me, Mom. Everything...

832
01:19:45,907 --> 01:19:47,947
I love...

833
01:19:49,494 --> 01:19:51,950
I love...

834
01:20:49,054 --> 01:20:51,093
<i>Anakin!</i>

835
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:53,098
<i>No!</i>

836
01:21:13,495 --> 01:21:15,119
What is it?

837
01:21:16,206 --> 01:21:19,657
Pain, suffering...

838
01:21:20,251 --> 01:21:22,244
death I feel.

839
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,919
Something terrible has happened.

840
01:21:32,597 --> 01:21:35,598
Young Skywalker is in pain...

841
01:21:35,725 --> 01:21:37,599
terrible pain.

842
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:46,017
The transmitter is working,
but we're not receiving a return signal.

843
01:21:46,152 --> 01:21:48,857
Coruscant's too far.
R4, can you boost the power?

844
01:21:50,448 --> 01:21:52,441
We'll have to try something else.

845
01:21:55,370 --> 01:21:58,157
Maybe we can contact Anakin
on Naboo.

846
01:21:58,498 --> 01:22:00,158
It's much closer.

847
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,285
Anakin, do you copy?

848
01:22:04,421 --> 01:22:07,375
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin?

849
01:22:07,507 --> 01:22:09,832
He's not on Naboo, R4.

850
01:22:11,386 --> 01:22:13,544
I'm going to try and widen the range.

851
01:22:16,975 --> 01:22:18,932
I do hope nothing's happened to him.

852
01:22:26,443 --> 01:22:28,316
That's Anakin's tracking signal,
all right...

853
01:22:28,445 --> 01:22:30,900
but it's coming from Tatooine.

854
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:35,064
What in the blazes is he doing there?

855
01:22:35,201 --> 01:22:37,159
I told him to stay on Naboo.

856
01:22:39,831 --> 01:22:42,322
We haven't got much time.

857
01:22:42,459 --> 01:22:44,498
Anakin, do you copy?

858
01:22:44,628 --> 01:22:46,667
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.

859
01:22:54,596 --> 01:22:56,505
<i>Retransmit this message...</i>

860
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:01,221
<i>Anakin, do you copy?</i>

861
01:23:01,353 --> 01:23:03,678
<i>My long-range transmitter</i>
<i>has been knocked out.</i>

862
01:23:03,813 --> 01:23:06,139
<i>Retransmit this message to Coruscant.</i>

863
01:23:50,694 --> 01:23:52,686
I brought you something.

864
01:23:52,821 --> 01:23:54,944
Are you hungry?

865
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:58,657
The shifter broke.

866
01:24:00,537 --> 01:24:03,324
Life seems so much simpler
when you're fixing things.

867
01:24:05,792 --> 01:24:09,291
I'm good at fixing things.
Always was.

868
01:24:11,631 --> 01:24:13,588
But I couldn't...

869
01:24:17,595 --> 01:24:19,505
Why'd she have to die?

870
01:24:23,018 --> 01:24:25,094
Why couldn't I save her?

871
01:24:25,228 --> 01:24:27,268
I know I could have!

872
01:24:30,108 --> 01:24:32,646
Sometimes there are things
no one can fix.

873
01:24:34,321 --> 01:24:36,990
- You're not all-powerful, Ani.
- Well, I should be!

874
01:24:39,743 --> 01:24:41,735
Someday I will be.

875
01:24:42,078 --> 01:24:44,700
I will be the most powerful Jedi ever.

876
01:24:46,416 --> 01:24:48,456
I promise you.

877
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:51,536
I will even learn
to stop people from dying.

878
01:24:55,342 --> 01:24:59,291
It's all Obi-Wan's fault!
He's jealous!

879
01:24:59,429 --> 01:25:01,469
He's holding me back!

880
01:25:05,852 --> 01:25:07,892
What's wrong, Ani?

881
01:25:18,657 --> 01:25:20,614
I killed them.

882
01:25:22,369 --> 01:25:24,326
I killed them all.

883
01:25:26,164 --> 01:25:28,038
They're dead.

884
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:30,242
Every single one of them.

885
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:34,377
And not just the men...

886
01:25:36,424 --> 01:25:38,334
but the women...

887
01:25:38,468 --> 01:25:40,377
and the children too.

888
01:25:41,346 --> 01:25:43,385
They're like animals...

889
01:25:43,515 --> 01:25:45,840
and I slaughtered them like animals!

890
01:25:47,477 --> 01:25:49,470
I hate them!

891
01:26:07,330 --> 01:26:09,287
To be angry is to be human.

892
01:26:09,416 --> 01:26:11,289
I'm a Jedi.

893
01:26:12,419 --> 01:26:14,292
I know I'm better than this.

894
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:32,806
I know wherever you are
it's become a better place.

895
01:26:33,231 --> 01:26:38,059
You were the most loving partner
a man could ever have.

896
01:26:41,031 --> 01:26:43,070
Goodbye, my darling wife.

897
01:26:47,078 --> 01:26:48,987
And thank you.

898
01:27:16,316 --> 01:27:18,558
I wasn't strong enough
to save you, Mom.

899
01:27:21,071 --> 01:27:22,944
I wasn't strong enough.

900
01:27:27,535 --> 01:27:30,869
But I promise I won't fail again.

901
01:27:41,841 --> 01:27:43,881
I miss you...

902
01:27:45,261 --> 01:27:47,171
so much.

903
01:27:54,145 --> 01:27:56,815
R2? What are you doing here?

904
01:27:59,734 --> 01:28:03,946
It seems that he is carrying
a message from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

905
01:28:04,948 --> 01:28:08,068
Master Ani, does that name
mean anything to you?

906
01:28:10,245 --> 01:28:12,652
<i>Anakin, my long-range transmitter</i>
<i>has been knocked out.</i>

907
01:28:12,789 --> 01:28:15,031
<i>Retransmit this message</i>
<i>to Coruscant.</i>

908
01:28:19,546 --> 01:28:21,752
<i>I have tracked the bounty hunter,</i>
<i>Jango Fett...</i>

909
01:28:21,881 --> 01:28:24,004
<i>to the droid foundries on Geonosis.</i>

910
01:28:24,134 --> 01:28:27,752
<i>The Trade Federation is</i>
<i>to take delivery of a droid army here...</i>

911
01:28:27,887 --> 01:28:29,880
<i>and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray...</i>

912
01:28:30,015 --> 01:28:33,466
<i>is behind the assassination attempts</i>
<i>on Senator Amidala.</i>

913
01:28:33,601 --> 01:28:35,724
<i>The Commerce Guilds</i>
<i>and the Corporate Alliance...</i>

914
01:28:35,854 --> 01:28:39,519
<i>have both pledged their armies</i>
<i>to Count Dooku and are forming...</i>

915
01:28:39,649 --> 01:28:41,689
<i>Wait.</i>

916
01:28:52,537 --> 01:28:57,164
More happening on Geonosis, I feel,
than has been revealed.

917
01:28:57,292 --> 01:28:59,035
I agree.

918
01:29:00,462 --> 01:29:02,703
<i>We will deal with Count Dooku.</i>

919
01:29:02,839 --> 01:29:06,374
<i>The most important thing for you</i>
<i>is to stay where you are.</i>

920
01:29:06,509 --> 01:29:09,214
<i>Protect the senator at all costs.</i>

921
01:29:09,346 --> 01:29:11,884
<i>That is your first priority.</i>

922
01:29:13,391 --> 01:29:15,348
Understood, Master.

923
01:29:15,477 --> 01:29:17,469
They'll never get there
in time to save him.

924
01:29:17,604 --> 01:29:20,640
They have to come halfway
across the galaxy. Look.

925
01:29:22,859 --> 01:29:24,935
Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

926
01:29:25,070 --> 01:29:27,027
If he's still alive.

927
01:29:28,948 --> 01:29:31,570
Are you just gonna sit here
and let him die?

928
01:29:31,701 --> 01:29:34,192
- He's your friend, your mentor.
- He's like my father!

929
01:29:35,413 --> 01:29:39,078
But you heard Master Windu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here.

930
01:29:39,209 --> 01:29:42,412
He gave you strict orders
to protect me...

931
01:29:42,545 --> 01:29:44,752
and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.

932
01:29:46,132 --> 01:29:49,667
If you plan to protect me,
you'll just have to come along.

933
01:29:53,723 --> 01:29:56,890
I'm not worried, R2.
It's just I've never flown before.

934
01:30:07,195 --> 01:30:10,115
The Commerce Guilds are preparing
for war. There can be no doubt of that.

935
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:12,197
Count Dooku must have made
a treaty with them.

936
01:30:12,325 --> 01:30:15,694
The debate is over.

937
01:30:15,829 --> 01:30:18,783
Now we need that clone army.

938
01:30:18,915 --> 01:30:21,833
Unfortunately,
the debate is not over.

939
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:24,367
The senate will never approve
the use of clones...

940
01:30:24,504 --> 01:30:26,247
before the separatists attack.

941
01:30:26,381 --> 01:30:28,255
This is a crisis.

942
01:30:28,383 --> 01:30:31,467
The senate must vote the chancellor
emergency powers.

943
01:30:31,594 --> 01:30:34,679
He can then approve
the creation of an army.

944
01:30:35,015 --> 01:30:37,173
But what senator would have
the courage...

945
01:30:37,309 --> 01:30:39,846
to propose such a radical amendment?

946
01:30:39,978 --> 01:30:44,058
If only Senator Amidala were here.

947
01:31:05,462 --> 01:31:07,289
Traitor.

948
01:31:07,797 --> 01:31:10,964
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.

949
01:31:11,092 --> 01:31:13,132
They have gone too far.
This is madness.

950
01:31:13,261 --> 01:31:15,835
I thought you were
the leader here, Dooku.

951
01:31:15,972 --> 01:31:18,546
This had nothing to do with me,
I assure you.

952
01:31:18,683 --> 01:31:22,099
I will petition immediately
to have you set free.

953
01:31:22,228 --> 01:31:25,847
Well, I hope it doesn't take too long.
I have work to do.

954
01:31:25,982 --> 01:31:29,766
May I ask why a Jedi knight...

955
01:31:29,903 --> 01:31:32,310
is all the way out here on Geonosis?

956
01:31:32,447 --> 01:31:35,318
I've been tracking a bounty hunter
named Jango Fett.

957
01:31:35,450 --> 01:31:37,324
Do you know him?

958
01:31:37,452 --> 01:31:39,990
There are no bounty hunters here
that I am aware of.

959
01:31:40,121 --> 01:31:42,031
The Geonosians don't trust them.

960
01:31:42,165 --> 01:31:45,036
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.

961
01:31:46,169 --> 01:31:50,333
It's a great pity our paths
have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.

962
01:31:51,007 --> 01:31:53,463
Qui-Gon always spoke
very highly of you.

963
01:31:58,348 --> 01:32:00,387
I wish he were still alive.

964
01:32:01,851 --> 01:32:04,556
I could use his help right now.

965
01:32:05,689 --> 01:32:07,895
Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.

966
01:32:09,776 --> 01:32:12,563
Don't be so sure, my young Jedi.

967
01:32:12,696 --> 01:32:15,234
You forget that he was once
my apprentice...

968
01:32:15,365 --> 01:32:17,404
just as you were once his.

969
01:32:18,368 --> 01:32:20,574
He knew all about the corruption
in the senate...

970
01:32:20,704 --> 01:32:23,778
but he wouldn't have gone along with
it if he had learned the truth as I have.

971
01:32:23,878 --> 01:32:26,583
- The truth?
- The truth.

972
01:32:33,008 --> 01:32:36,293
What if I told you that the Republic
was now under the control...

973
01:32:36,428 --> 01:32:38,467
of the dark lord of the Sith?

974
01:32:38,596 --> 01:32:41,432
No, that's not possible.
The Jedi would be aware of it.

975
01:32:41,558 --> 01:32:45,805
The dark side of the Force
has clouded their vision, my friend.

976
01:32:46,938 --> 01:32:49,476
Hundreds of senators
are now under the influence...

977
01:32:49,607 --> 01:32:54,186
of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.

978
01:32:55,322 --> 01:32:56,899
I don't believe you.

979
01:32:57,032 --> 01:32:59,357
The viceroy of the Trade Federation...

980
01:32:59,492 --> 01:33:02,696
was once in league
with this Darth Sidious...

981
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:07,412
but he was betrayed
ten years ago by the dark lord.

982
01:33:07,542 --> 01:33:10,626
He came to me for help.
He told me everything.

983
01:33:12,672 --> 01:33:14,712
You must join me, Obi-Wan...

984
01:33:15,925 --> 01:33:19,875
and together we will destroy the Sith!

985
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:23,928
I will never join you, Dooku.

986
01:33:33,443 --> 01:33:36,360
It may be difficult
to secure your release.

987
01:33:44,204 --> 01:33:47,074
It's -a clear
desa separatists made a pact...

988
01:33:47,207 --> 01:33:49,828
wesa desa Federation du Trade.

989
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:54,253
Senators, "dellow felagates":

990
01:33:54,381 --> 01:33:58,378
In response to this direct threat
to the Republic...

991
01:33:58,510 --> 01:34:02,175
mesa propose that the senate...

992
01:34:02,305 --> 01:34:05,923
give immediately emergency powers...

993
01:34:06,059 --> 01:34:08,680
to the supreme chancellor.

994
01:34:12,774 --> 01:34:14,897
Palpatine! Palpatine!

995
01:34:17,988 --> 01:34:21,238
Order! We shall have order!

996
01:34:22,951 --> 01:34:26,236
It is with great reluctance...

997
01:34:26,371 --> 01:34:28,447
that I have agreed to this calling.

998
01:34:29,833 --> 01:34:33,782
I love democracy.
I love the Republic.

999
01:34:34,671 --> 01:34:36,829
The power you give me...

1000
01:34:36,965 --> 01:34:41,461
I will lay down
when this crisis has abated.

1001
01:34:45,974 --> 01:34:50,766
And as my first act
with this new authority...

1002
01:34:50,895 --> 01:34:55,273
I will create
a grand army of the Republic...

1003
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:59,148
to counter the increasing threats
of the separatists.

1004
01:35:00,530 --> 01:35:02,404
It is done, then.

1005
01:35:07,704 --> 01:35:11,369
I will take what Jedi we have left
and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.

1006
01:35:11,499 --> 01:35:15,367
Visit I will the cloners on Kamino...

1007
01:35:16,421 --> 01:35:20,122
and see this army
they have created for the Republic.

1008
01:35:40,779 --> 01:35:42,818
See those columns of steam
straight ahead?

1009
01:35:42,947 --> 01:35:44,987
They're exhaust vents of some type.

1010
01:35:45,867 --> 01:35:47,824
That'll do.

1011
01:35:57,295 --> 01:36:00,213
Look, whatever happens
out there, follow my lead.

1012
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:02,416
I'm not interested
in getting into a war here.

1013
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:04,424
As a member of the senate...

1014
01:36:04,552 --> 01:36:07,388
maybe I can find
a diplomatic solution to this mess.

1015
01:36:07,764 --> 01:36:09,721
Don't worry.

1016
01:36:09,975 --> 01:36:12,263
I've given up
trying to argue with you.

1017
01:36:17,023 --> 01:36:20,226
My obtuse little friend,
if they had needed our help...

1018
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:22,234
they would have asked for it.

1019
01:36:22,362 --> 01:36:25,482
You obviously have a great deal
to learn about human behaviour.

1020
01:36:51,391 --> 01:36:54,558
For a mechanic, you seem to do
an excessive amount of thinking.

1021
01:36:56,646 --> 01:36:59,220
I am programmed
to understand humans!

1022
01:37:02,819 --> 01:37:04,693
"What does that mean?"

1023
01:37:04,821 --> 01:37:07,526
That means I am in charge here!

1024
01:37:07,657 --> 01:37:09,282
Where are you going now?

1025
01:37:09,409 --> 01:37:12,908
You don't know what's out there.
Have you no sense at all?

1026
01:37:13,288 --> 01:37:14,948
Idiot!

1027
01:37:17,167 --> 01:37:18,910
Please wait.

1028
01:37:19,711 --> 01:37:21,620
Do you know where you're going?

1029
01:37:34,267 --> 01:37:35,892
Wait.

1030
01:38:51,678 --> 01:38:53,386
Oh, my goodness!

1031
01:38:53,513 --> 01:38:55,055
Shut me down!

1032
01:38:56,182 --> 01:38:58,140
Machines making machines.

1033
01:38:58,268 --> 01:38:59,727
How perverse!

1034
01:39:00,687 --> 01:39:02,098
Calm down, R2!

1035
01:39:02,230 --> 01:39:04,686
I almost fell.

1036
01:39:04,816 --> 01:39:06,773
You'll get your chance...

1037
01:39:08,778 --> 01:39:10,605
I'm scrap.

1038
01:39:11,698 --> 01:39:14,070
It's a nightmare!

1039
01:39:15,869 --> 01:39:17,826
I want to go home!

1040
01:39:19,372 --> 01:39:21,246
What did I do to deserve this?

1041
01:40:01,206 --> 01:40:03,412
I wonder what happened
to poor little R2.

1042
01:40:03,541 --> 01:40:05,914
He's always getting himself
into trouble.

1043
01:40:07,295 --> 01:40:08,873
Oh, no!

1044
01:40:18,306 --> 01:40:19,931
Uh-oh.

1045
01:40:23,561 --> 01:40:25,519
I'm so confused.

1046
01:42:21,429 --> 01:42:23,256
Not again!

1047
01:42:23,598 --> 01:42:25,555
Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.

1048
01:42:34,693 --> 01:42:36,103
Don't move, Jedi!

1049
01:42:36,236 --> 01:42:37,730
Take him away.

1050
01:42:56,756 --> 01:42:58,583
Don't be afraid.

1051
01:43:00,343 --> 01:43:02,336
I'm not afraid to die.

1052
01:43:07,183 --> 01:43:11,311
I've been dying a little bit each day
since you came back into my life.

1053
01:43:12,605 --> 01:43:15,143
What are you talking about?

1054
01:43:16,651 --> 01:43:18,691
I love you.

1055
01:43:22,490 --> 01:43:24,448
You love me?

1056
01:43:28,913 --> 01:43:32,164
I thought we had decided
not to fall in love...

1057
01:43:33,918 --> 01:43:36,919
that we would be forced
to live a lie...

1058
01:43:37,797 --> 01:43:40,798
and that it would destroy our lives.

1059
01:43:41,718 --> 01:43:43,960
I think our lives are about
to be destroyed anyway.

1060
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:50,927
I truly...

1061
01:43:51,936 --> 01:43:54,344
deeply love you...

1062
01:43:55,565 --> 01:43:58,139
and before we die,
I want you to know.

1063
01:44:55,292 --> 01:44:57,913
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd got my message.

1064
01:44:58,044 --> 01:45:01,081
I retransmitted it
just as you had requested, Master.

1065
01:45:03,466 --> 01:45:05,340
Then we decided
to come and rescue you.

1066
01:45:06,303 --> 01:45:07,845
Good job.

1067
01:45:20,191 --> 01:45:23,228
Settle down. Settle down.

1068
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:30,941
Let the executions begin.

1069
01:46:03,735 --> 01:46:06,652
I've got a bad feeling about this.

1070
01:46:32,222 --> 01:46:34,713
- Just relax. Concentrate.
- What about Padmé?

1071
01:46:34,849 --> 01:46:36,972
She seems to be on top of things.

1072
01:47:39,956 --> 01:47:41,664
She can't do that!

1073
01:47:41,791 --> 01:47:43,701
Shoot her... or something!

1074
01:49:02,539 --> 01:49:03,950
Jump!

1075
01:49:28,064 --> 01:49:31,599
This isn't how it's supposed to be!

1076
01:49:31,735 --> 01:49:33,359
Jango! Finish her off!

1077
01:49:33,486 --> 01:49:36,690
Patience, Viceroy, patience.
She will die.

1078
01:50:07,562 --> 01:50:09,021
Master Windu.

1079
01:50:09,147 --> 01:50:11,436
How pleasant of you to join us.

1080
01:50:11,566 --> 01:50:13,559
This party's over.

1081
01:50:27,165 --> 01:50:29,407
Brave...

1082
01:50:29,542 --> 01:50:31,868
but foolish, my old Jedi friend.

1083
01:50:32,003 --> 01:50:33,830
You're impossibly outnumbered.

1084
01:50:33,964 --> 01:50:36,289
I don't think so.

1085
01:50:36,424 --> 01:50:37,835
We'll see.

1086
01:51:16,589 --> 01:51:19,163
My legs aren't moving.
I must need maintenance.

1087
01:51:58,923 --> 01:52:01,379
What's all this noise?
A battle!

1088
01:52:01,509 --> 01:52:03,668
There's been some terrible mistake!

1089
01:52:03,803 --> 01:52:06,508
I'm programmed for etiquette,
not destruction!

1090
01:53:34,060 --> 01:53:35,887
Die, Jedi dogs!

1091
01:53:36,021 --> 01:53:37,764
Oh! What did I say?

1092
01:53:46,865 --> 01:53:50,150
Oh, dear.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1093
01:53:55,832 --> 01:53:58,750
Excuse me. I'm trapped.
I can't get up.

1094
01:54:12,974 --> 01:54:16,723
- You call this a diplomatic solution?
- No, I call it aggressive negotiations.

1095
01:54:21,858 --> 01:54:23,815
- Uh-oh.
- Roger, roger.

1096
01:54:42,003 --> 01:54:44,245
R2, what are you doing here?

1097
01:54:47,467 --> 01:54:48,795
What are you doing?

1098
01:54:48,927 --> 01:54:51,548
Stop that!
You're going to strain something.

1099
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:53,423
My neck!

1100
01:54:55,725 --> 01:54:58,762
Now where are you taking me?
This is such a drag!

1101
01:55:03,775 --> 01:55:05,815
I'm quite beside myself.

1102
01:55:14,536 --> 01:55:17,739
R2, please be careful!
You're singeing my circuits!

1103
01:55:19,207 --> 01:55:21,698
Yes, but is my head on straight?

1104
01:55:44,482 --> 01:55:46,107
Master Windu...

1105
01:55:46,234 --> 01:55:48,440
you have fought gallantly...

1106
01:55:49,612 --> 01:55:53,657
worthy of recognition
in the archives of the Jedi order.

1107
01:55:55,618 --> 01:55:56,899
Now...

1108
01:55:57,912 --> 01:56:00,285
it is finished.

1109
01:56:00,415 --> 01:56:02,242
Surrender...

1110
01:56:02,500 --> 01:56:05,205
and your lives will be spared.

1111
01:56:06,087 --> 01:56:09,172
We will not be hostages
to be bartered, Dooku!

1112
01:56:09,299 --> 01:56:10,330
Then...

1113
01:56:11,801 --> 01:56:13,877
I'm sorry, old friend.

1114
01:56:24,564 --> 01:56:25,975
Look!

1115
01:56:37,994 --> 01:56:41,944
Around the survivors
a perimeter create.

1116
01:57:38,513 --> 01:57:41,514
I've had the most peculiar dream!

1117
01:57:52,152 --> 01:57:54,109
If Dooku escapes...

1118
01:57:54,237 --> 01:57:57,938
rally more systems
to his cause he will.

1119
01:58:02,495 --> 01:58:04,322
Hold on!

1120
01:58:08,877 --> 01:58:10,834
Aim right above the fuel cells!

1121
01:58:17,177 --> 01:58:19,419
Good call, my young Padawan.

1122
01:58:33,693 --> 01:58:35,982
The Jedi have amassed a huge army.

1123
01:58:36,112 --> 01:58:38,188
That doesn't seem possible.

1124
01:58:38,573 --> 01:58:40,981
How could the Jedi
come up with an army so quickly?

1125
01:58:41,284 --> 01:58:44,487
We must send
all available droids into battle.

1126
01:58:44,621 --> 01:58:46,530
There are too many.

1127
01:58:47,499 --> 01:58:50,250
Our communications have been jammed.

1128
01:58:58,468 --> 01:59:01,386
Pilot, land in that assembly area!

1129
01:59:01,513 --> 01:59:02,793
Yes, sir.

1130
01:59:10,897 --> 01:59:12,142
Sir...

1131
01:59:12,273 --> 01:59:14,895
I have five special commando units
awaiting your orders, sir.

1132
01:59:15,902 --> 01:59:19,188
To the forward command centre
take me.

1133
01:59:42,512 --> 01:59:45,264
Attack those Federation starships,
quickly!

1134
01:59:56,234 --> 02:00:00,018
Master Yoda,
all forward positions are advancing.

1135
02:00:00,155 --> 02:00:01,982
Very good.

1136
02:00:02,657 --> 02:00:04,282
Very good.

1137
02:00:32,479 --> 02:00:34,555
This is not looking good at all!

1138
02:00:35,857 --> 02:00:39,107
We must get the starships
back into space.

1139
02:00:42,155 --> 02:00:46,069
We have to order a retreat.

1140
02:00:46,201 --> 02:00:48,526
My master will never allow
the Republic...

1141
02:00:48,662 --> 02:00:50,950
to get away with this treachery.

1142
02:00:51,122 --> 02:00:54,326
I'm sending my warriors
to hide in the catacombs.

1143
02:00:54,459 --> 02:00:58,504
The Jedi must not find
our designs for the ultimate weapon.

1144
02:01:00,924 --> 02:01:06,215
If they find out what we are planning
to build, we're doomed.

1145
02:01:09,474 --> 02:01:11,882
I will take the designs
with me to Coruscant.

1146
02:01:12,852 --> 02:01:15,557
They will be much safer there
with my master.

1147
02:02:10,118 --> 02:02:14,863
Concentrate all your fire
on the nearest starship.

1148
02:02:14,998 --> 02:02:16,825
Yes, sir.

1149
02:02:16,958 --> 02:02:20,410
Move all quadrants to sector 515.

1150
02:03:00,543 --> 02:03:02,002
Look over there!

1151
02:03:05,507 --> 02:03:07,879
It's Dooku! Shoot him down!

1152
02:03:08,009 --> 02:03:09,883
We're out of rockets, sir.

1153
02:03:10,011 --> 02:03:12,846
- Follow him!
- We're gonna need some help!

1154
02:03:13,181 --> 02:03:17,013
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!

1155
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:43,073
Put the ship down!

1156
02:03:43,211 --> 02:03:45,122
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way!

1157
02:03:45,222 --> 02:03:46,957
Follow that speeder!

1158
02:03:53,054 --> 02:03:55,380
- Lower the ship!
- I can't take Dooku alone!

1159
02:03:55,515 --> 02:03:58,966
I need you! If we catch him,
we can end this war right now!

1160
02:03:59,102 --> 02:04:02,103
- We have a job to do!
- I don't care! Put the ship down!

1161
02:04:02,230 --> 02:04:04,472
You will be expelled
from the Jedi order!

1162
02:04:04,607 --> 02:04:07,811
- I can't leave her!
- Come to your senses!

1163
02:04:07,944 --> 02:04:10,566
What do you think Padmé would do
were she in your position?

1164
02:04:15,243 --> 02:04:17,236
She would do her duty.

1165
02:04:26,254 --> 02:04:28,294
The droid army is in full retreat.

1166
02:04:28,423 --> 02:04:31,507
Well done, Commander.
Bring me a ship.

1167
02:04:58,495 --> 02:05:01,614
You're gonna pay for all the Jedi
that you killed today, Dooku.

1168
02:05:01,748 --> 02:05:03,408
We'll take him together.

1169
02:05:03,541 --> 02:05:05,499
- I'm taking him now!
- No, Anakin! No!

1170
02:05:13,677 --> 02:05:17,176
As you see, my Jedi powers
are far beyond yours.

1171
02:05:17,305 --> 02:05:19,214
Now... back down.

1172
02:05:25,063 --> 02:05:26,890
I don't think so.

1173
02:05:39,869 --> 02:05:42,407
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.

1174
02:05:42,539 --> 02:05:45,623
Yoda holds you in such high esteem.

1175
02:05:48,003 --> 02:05:50,410
Surely you can do better.

1176
02:06:01,599 --> 02:06:03,473
Are you all right?

1177
02:06:03,601 --> 02:06:05,261
Uh-huh.

1178
02:06:05,895 --> 02:06:08,137
We'd better get back
to the forward command centre.

1179
02:06:08,273 --> 02:06:09,850
No.

1180
02:06:09,983 --> 02:06:13,482
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.

1181
02:06:13,611 --> 02:06:15,569
Get a transport. Hurry!

1182
02:06:15,697 --> 02:06:16,728
Right away.

1183
02:06:41,890 --> 02:06:43,717
Brave of you, boy.

1184
02:06:45,018 --> 02:06:47,224
But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson.

1185
02:06:47,354 --> 02:06:48,931
I am a slow learner.

1186
02:07:51,418 --> 02:07:53,161
Master Yoda.

1187
02:07:53,295 --> 02:07:56,331
Count Dooku.

1188
02:07:56,464 --> 02:07:59,798
You have interfered with our affairs
for the last time.

1189
02:08:31,124 --> 02:08:34,042
Powerful you have become, Dooku.

1190
02:08:34,544 --> 02:08:37,628
The dark side I sense in you.

1191
02:08:37,756 --> 02:08:40,543
I've become more powerful
than any Jedi.

1192
02:08:41,676 --> 02:08:43,301
Even you.

1193
02:08:58,693 --> 02:09:01,730
Much to learn you still have.

1194
02:09:01,863 --> 02:09:05,030
It is obvious that this contest
cannot be decided...

1195
02:09:05,158 --> 02:09:07,400
by our knowledge of the Force...

1196
02:09:09,454 --> 02:09:12,027
but by our skills with a lightsabre.

1197
02:09:53,832 --> 02:09:57,035
Fought well you have,
my old Padawan.

1198
02:09:57,168 --> 02:09:58,912
This is just the beginning.

1199
02:12:32,115 --> 02:12:34,571
The Force is with us, Master Sidious.

1200
02:12:34,951 --> 02:12:37,656
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus.

1201
02:12:39,539 --> 02:12:41,864
You have done well.

1202
02:12:42,334 --> 02:12:44,326
I have good news for you, my lord.

1203
02:12:45,837 --> 02:12:48,873
- The war has begun.
- Excellent.

1204
02:12:49,466 --> 02:12:52,170
Everything is going as planned.

1205
02:13:02,145 --> 02:13:06,095
Do you believe what Count Dooku said
about Sidious controlling the senate?

1206
02:13:06,650 --> 02:13:08,642
It doesn't feel right.

1207
02:13:08,985 --> 02:13:11,939
Joined the dark side Dooku has.

1208
02:13:13,281 --> 02:13:14,989
Lies, deceit...

1209
02:13:15,116 --> 02:13:18,865
creating mistrust are his ways now.

1210
02:13:18,995 --> 02:13:20,406
Nevertheless...

1211
02:13:20,538 --> 02:13:23,290
I feel we should keep
a closer eye on the senate.

1212
02:13:23,667 --> 02:13:25,706
I agree.

1213
02:13:26,836 --> 02:13:28,710
Where is your apprentice?

1214
02:13:28,838 --> 02:13:32,706
On his way to Naboo,
escorting Senator Amidala home.

1215
02:13:34,511 --> 02:13:37,880
I have to admit that without the clones,
it would not have been a victory.

1216
02:13:38,264 --> 02:13:40,304
Victory?

1217
02:13:41,184 --> 02:13:43,556
Victory, you say?

1218
02:13:43,687 --> 02:13:47,387
Master Obi-Wan, not victory.

1219
02:13:48,942 --> 02:13:52,145
The shroud of the dark side has fallen.

1220
02:13:53,774 --> 02:13:57,321
Begun the Clone War has.

1221
02:13:58,305 --> 02:14:58,503

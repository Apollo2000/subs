Huh?

3
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,166
Huh?

4
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:32,968
- What?
- Huh?

5
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:36,889
Wolf!

6
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,932
- Get out of my way!
- Move!

7
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,017
Lord, save us.

8
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,148
Back. Stay back! Back.

9
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:08,920
Huh?

10
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,926
Sweet Mother Divine, save us.

11
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,351
Oh, my God! Oh!

12
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,436
No!

13
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,207
You're a Wolfwalker?

14
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,459
Thank you.

See that, Merlyn? Right on the nose.

18
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,635
What are you saying?
I was aiming for the nose.

19
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,720
I'm glad you agree.

20
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,055
Robyn.

21
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,389
Yes, Father?

22
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:27,851
Busy with your chores, I assume?

23
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,394
- Yes, Father.
- Oh.

24
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:30,562
Practically finished.

25
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:32,439
Seems you certainly haven't been idle.

26
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,691
Oh, idle, no.

27
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,402
I've been sweeping and dusting, mopping.

28
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,154
Just can't keep up with it.

29
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,824
Hmm.

30
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,954
I wonder what range that wolf poster is.
Fifteen feet?

31
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,622
No way. Twenty at least.

32
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,041
Uh... uh... Although, I'm not sure.

33
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,794
I haven't really considered it.
Too busy cleaning.

34
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:59,007
Robyn, this is our new home. The bucket
and brush are your tools now, not this.

35
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:01,677
Ugh. It's so boring
being stuck in here all day.

36
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,180
I should be out on adventures with you,
like we did back in England.

37
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,892
Oh, lass. Lord Protector has strict rules.

38
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,311
No children beyond the walls,
you know that.

39
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,730
The forest is brimming with real wolves,

40
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,024
and it's my job to hunt them down,
not yours.

41
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,317
I'm not afraid of a wolf.

42
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:18,861
You've never even seen a wolf.

43
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,237
And I'm still not afraid.

44
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,656
Yes, and that's why
I must be afraid for you.

45
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,789
Well, I'll come with you to the gates.

46
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:32,583
I'll be back before sundown.

47
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,959
Stay indoors.

48
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,582
Time to practice our tracking, Merlyn.

49
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,053
Yes, now.

50
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,771
Pies here!

51
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,523
You find him, I'll follow.

52
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,417
Fish! Fresh fish!

53
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:18,504
Good work, Merlyn.

00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,321
- Just two farthings.
- Where's he gone?

00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,449

I was only gonna track you
as far as the gates.

66
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,420
Really? Then what?

67
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,131
Follow me out and slay
the pack of wolves single-handed?

68
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,883
Yeah, but we could hunt them together.

69
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:07,052
Wolves, bears, dragons, even!

70
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,137

71
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,477
We could climb mountains and

find mermaids and selkies, even.

Hey, English girl. Where do you think
you're going dressed like that?

87
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,879
I'm a hunter.

00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,483
"I'm a hunter."

89
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,236
Would you listen
to her fancy dancy accent?

90
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,698
I am a hunter. Just like my father.
He's the best hunter there is.

91
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,701
No, he's not. My father's the best hunter.

92
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,746
Yeah? Well, we're hunting wolves
for the Lord Protector.

93
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,707
Lord Protector put my father
in chains for nothing.

94
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,251
You English think you're so great,
but you're not.

95
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,086
You should all just go home.

96
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,810
But first, give us a go on your crossbow.

97
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:25,964
No!

98
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,219
- You'll pay for that, English girl.
- She pushed him!

99
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,929
You're dead now!

100
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,852
- What's going on here?
- Soldier! Leg it!

101
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,360
Uh.

102
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,909
Why must you wander off like that, Robyn?

103
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,119
I was trying to help you,
and then there was a boy,

104
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,651
and he said his father
was better than you,

105
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,040
- and then he wanted my crossbow and...
- Robyn!

106
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:03,001
We are not so welcome in this land yet.

107
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:07,005
You're better off to stay at home
while I'm working. You're safe there.

108
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:08,769
But I'd be just as safe
out there with you.

109
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,801
No, Robyn! Stay inside!

110
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,010
Do as you're told.

111
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,180
It's for your own good, Robyn.

112
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:17,599
Look...

113
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:22,729
this evening, when I'm back,
you can help me make new arrows. Hmm?

114
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:26,859
Tell me your stories of giants
and dragons. Would you like that?

115
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,110
I suppose so.

116
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,611
Now then, be good.

117
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:41,582
No children beyond the walls.
Lord Protector's orders.

118
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:50,048
If he could just see how good I am,
what a hunter I am,

119
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,633
then he'd have to let me come along.

120
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,387
What are you, Merlyn?
A falcon or a chicken?

121
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,311
- Kill the wolf! Kill the wolf!
- Hmm?

122
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,187
Leave me alone!

123
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,189
Get away from me!

124
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,735
Got you now, wolf!

125
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:14,156
Aha! Lads, we got a flag! Come on!

126
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,783
Down with the Lord Protector!

127
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,829
- Oi! Stop this at once!
- Get out of here!

128
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:22,633
- Get that flag!
- Get out of here, quickly!

129
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,752
Oh! Go on, you little rebels, you!

130
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,464
Well done!
Well done, boys! Run! Run!

131
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,034
Yes, I see it.

132
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,122
I won't step in it.

133
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:10,397
Help! Wolf! Wolf! Help!

134
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,523
Wolf?

135
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:15,068
Wolf! Merlyn, quick, fly. Find the wolf.

136
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:23,827
Wolf!

137
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,287
- Run!
- Get back!

138
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,289
Run!

139
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,000
Wolves!

140
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,594
Get away! Get back!

141
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,180
Help!

142
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,768
Get back! Get back!

143
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,855
Why, shoot! For God's sake, shoot!

144
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:06,203
Merlyn!

145
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:24,888
Huh?

146
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,435
What?

147
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,483
No! That's my bird! Leave him be!

148
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,529
Stop!

149
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:53,876
Robyn!

150
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:01,925
- Robyn!
- Merlyn, he's... he's gone!

151
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,469
- We have to get him back.
- You could've been eaten alive.

152
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:06,680
What were you thinking?
What are you doing out here?

153
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,682
- I was trying to help you.
- Help me?

154
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,852
I told you, you shouldn't be out here!
This is why!

155
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,771
- Father, they took Merlyn.
- Lass, no.

156
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:17,191
No, you're not going after him.
Not in there.

157
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:18,442
But we can't leave him.

158
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:22,070
Look, I promised your mother
I'd keep you safe.

159
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,076
It's all right, love.

160
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,997
You'll be safe back in the town. Come on.

161
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,627
It's for your own good.

162
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:54,520
By God, you're one lucky girl.

163
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:57,356
Did you not see?
'Twas a Wolfwalker, by Crom!

164
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:58,607
Now calm down, will you.

165
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,817
Everyone knows you
can't be cutting down their woods.

166
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,903
If you do, they'll get you.
Sure, that's the deal.

167
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,488
There's no deal with anyone.

168
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:09,451
Saint Patrick made it with the old pagans
and you're breaking it, you eejits!

169
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:11,399
- We need to clear the woods.
- Did you not see?

170
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,121
Actually, I did see the wolf attack.

171
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:16,083
The way them wolves answered her call.

172
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,378
Them forests is riddled with wolves,
I tell you.

173
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,159
Well, won't be long
before the wolves are gone.

174
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:24,800
It won't be long before they're
inside the town walls with the hunger.

175
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:28,011
No. No, we'll tame these lands.
The Lord Protector has ordered it.

176
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:31,932
Ah, the great Lord Protector.

177
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:35,561
Renowned for being true to his word.
Hilarious.

178
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:37,938
At least the old king kept us safe.

179
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:41,567
He's just an upstart. Lord Protector.

180
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,403
Lord Protector.

181
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:45,904
Protector of what?

182
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,227
- Oi!
- Come here!

183
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:50,951
If you have grievances,
you should speak with me directly.

184
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,077
What are you doing? No!

185
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,997
- Get your hands off of...
- Hold still!

186
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,125
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph. This is a joke.
- Ah, get in.

187
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,711
Let me out of here!

188
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,922
I did nothing wrong!

189
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:06,175
By Crom! The devil take your head!

190
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:09,344
- Another wolf attack?
- Aye, my lord.

191
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:13,140
A few more like him and we have
another rebellion on our hands.

192
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:17,728
If we do not clear the trees,
the farmers cannot work the land,

193
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:21,398
and the woodcutters cannot clear the trees
with these wolves.

194
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,525
- This is not acceptable.
- Aye, my lord.

195
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:26,778
We must show them
the wolves are no threat.

196
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:29,281
They're just beasts. Finish them.

197
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,365
Yes, my lord.

198
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:36,538
And this is your girl, yes?

199
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:39,208
It is, my lord. Uh, Robyn.

200
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:43,504
There should be no child beyond the walls.
Why is she not in the scullery?

201
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,422
My lord, she...
She doesn't work there. She...

202
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:48,884
You! See to it that the girl
reports to the scullery.

203
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:49,968
Father.

204
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:52,095
Do as the Lord Protector commands, lass.

205
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:00,687
I ride out to deal
with the revolt in the south.

206
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:04,733
When I return, I want all the wolves
gone from this forest.

207
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,778
- Yes, my lord.
- Goodfellowe, you have two days.

208
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,613
Don't waste them.

209
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,922
Hey, psst, girl.

210
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:30,217
The one who took your bird,
I've seen her before.

211
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,553
A while back with her mammy.

212
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:36,807
Cross my heart,
she's one of them Wolfwalkers.

213
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,433
Wolfwalkers?

214
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:40,686
Yeah, Wolfwalkers.

215
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:45,774
The ones that can talk to wolves, like.
But you know, they can heal as well.

216
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:49,069
Her mother healed me with some wild magic.

217
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:52,823
Maybe she'll fix your bird up.
Maybe she'll eat him.

218
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:56,201
- I don't know.
- Oh... I need to get him back.

219
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:59,788
I'd say once we're behind them walls,
neither of us is going anywhere.

220
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,252
- Can you keep a secret?
- Huh?

221
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,798
Aw! My sheep.

222
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,844
Lads, you didn't
lock that gate right at all.

223
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,208
You let them sheep out, didn't you?

224
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,974
Oh, yeah. Blame me for that too.
Everything is Seán Óg's fault!

225
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,726
Get back in the cart, you.

226
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,841
I feel like stretching my legs!

227
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:26,928
- Help me with my sheep, you langers!
- I'll show them out!

228
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,734
Oi! Get him!

229
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:32,571
Hey, whatever your name is,
get back in that cart!

230
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:33,906
Round up those sheep.

231
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:35,949
Off of me! Have you no manners at all?

232
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,202
Get back in there, you!

233
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:39,870
An extra week in the stocks for that.

234
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,747
- Where's the girl gone?
- Don't see her.

235
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,123
Maybe in the woods.

236
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:46,627
Oi, you two, look out for a girl.
She ran into the forest.

237
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,963
Get her and bring her back to the castle.
Lord Protector's orders.

238
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:51,548
- Uh, yes, sir.
- Devil take...

239
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:57,095
English soldiers. Who do they think
they are? Bossing us around.

240
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,014
- What was that?
- Uh, nothing!

241
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,224
Get a move on!

242
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,350
Yes, sir!

243
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:11,151
Merlyn? Merlyn!

244
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,489
<i>♪ Wolf, wolf
Kill the wolf ♪</i>

245
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:18,325
<i>♪ Hunt them far and yonder ♪</i>

246
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,702
<i>♪ Wolf, wolf
Kill the wolf ♪</i>

247
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:24,039
<i>♪ Till all the wolves are done for ♪</i>

248
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,639
Merlyn?

249
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:42,850
Mm.

250
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:44,810
Merlyn!

251
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:50,023
Merlyn!

252
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:53,527
Look at you. You're good as new,
aren't you? How's that?

253
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,946
I'm so glad you're not hurt.

254
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:59,491
How did they heal your wing?
It was that girl, wasn't it?

255
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:03,412
What did she do?
Oh, I was afraid she was gonna eat you.

256
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:11,920
Huh? Uh.

257
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:16,091
Stay back, now! Back! I'll shoot!

258
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:18,343
Merlyn. Merlyn, what are you doing?

259
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:22,014
Get away, wolf! I swear, I'll...

260
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:26,310
Oh! Merlyn, stop that! No! Wha...

261
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,562
Stay away, wolf.

262
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:31,607
No. Get away.

263
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,776
No! Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

264
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,570
Uh!

265
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:43,660
Get back! I'm gonna get you!
Get away, wolf! Oh!

266
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:14,857
Oh.

267
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:22,950
Oh! Ooh!

268
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:28,789
Huh?

269
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,752
Huh? Merlyn?

270
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,298
Merlyn! Wait!

271
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:39,591
Merlyn!

272
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,317
Merlyn!

273
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:03,282
Merlyn!

274
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:12,833
Huh?

275
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:25,971
Oh!

276
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,155
Whoa!

277
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:39,378
Merlyn?

278
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:04,319
What?

279
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:42,107
You can come out now.
We can smell you. Yeah, you stink.

280
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:44,693
I knew you were here.
Come out of your hidey-hole.

281
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:46,278
Let's see you.

282
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:52,451
Don't kill me.

283
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,995
Ha! I do what I like. Come here.

284
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:57,247
You're... You're a-a...

285
00:24:57,331 --> 00:25:00,959
A Wolfwalker. So what?
You should thank me.

286
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:02,961
- Why?
- I saved your life.

287
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:04,796
Saved me? You bit me!

288
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,882
Well, you kicked me
in the gob enough times.

289
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:08,258
Well, you were attacking me.

290
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:10,636
I was trying to get you out of that trap.

291
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:13,263
And anyway, you came into my woods.

292
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:15,182
Your woods? They're our woods.

293
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:17,518
Your wolves are attacking the woodcutters
and the sheep.

294
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:22,064
They should be staying closer to the town
and so should you, townie.

295
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:24,525
Now give us a look at you.

296
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,735
- Are you seeing things?
- Ugh! Get off me!

297
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:28,695
- How's your smell?
- Ugh! Stop it!

298
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:30,906
Smells like townie. Any extra fur?

299
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:32,741
Ugh! That's mine! Get away!

300
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:36,662
Now, stop moving and let me fix it
before it's too late.

301
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:37,955
Hey, get off me!

302
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:40,499
Will you stop? Let me fix it!

303
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,960
Ugh! Fine.

304
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:58,851
But what?

305
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:03,272
Well, fixed now. Never happened.
Off you go.

306
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:04,565
You did heal Merlyn.

307
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:08,485
Yeah. I fixed you and your bird
and saved your life.

308
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:10,612
You're welcome, townie. Bye!

309
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:11,822
No, wait. Who's that?

310
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:14,241
Is she your... your mother?

311
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:16,994
Ugh. You better go
or the wolves will eat you.

312
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:19,162
What? But I don't...

313
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:21,415
Oh, no. Too late. They're gonna eat you!

314
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:22,499
No!

315
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,884
Whoa!

316
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:37,681
Ah!

317
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:45,355
Run away, townie girl!
The wolves are after you!

318
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,733
Can't get away from us, townie!

319
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:49,693
Get away from me!

320
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:52,279
But you're so slow.

321
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:56,241
Scared of your shadows, you are.
What would a townie know about wolves?

322
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:58,368
Why do you have so much stuff?

323
00:26:58,452 --> 00:27:00,704
Hey, stop! That's my gear for hunting!

324
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:03,415
Oh, a hunter. Ha! A little girl like you?

325
00:27:03,498 --> 00:27:05,125
Uh, well, you're a girl too.

326
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:07,377
I'm no girl! I'm a Wolfwalker!

327
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:09,671
Whoa!

328
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:11,089
Up you go!

329
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:14,801
When I sleeps, I'm a wolf.

330
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:19,389
When I'm awake, I'm me, Mebh!
Mebh Óg MacTire!

331
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,141
What's your name, anyway?

332
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:23,101
- Robyn.
- Robyn?

333
00:27:23,185 --> 00:27:27,731
Mm. I like birdies.
I climb so high to catch them.

334
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:30,943
I'm too smart for them, though.
They can't get away from me for long.

335
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:38,116
Ugh.

336
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,827
Oh.

337
00:27:40,911 --> 00:27:43,580
Caught again. Some hunter.

338
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:47,042
That's two for me, none for you.

339
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,752
Whoa!

340
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:53,382
Ugh. Stop being so annoying.
It's not funny, you know.

341
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:54,842
Argh! Let me down!

342
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:56,885
All right, townie.

343
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:58,637
If you say so.

344
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,432
No, wait! Oh!

345
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:03,559
Oh!

346
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:06,478
Hey! Stop calling me "townie."

347
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:09,898
All right, Robyn.
Back home with you. Fun's over.

348
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:13,151
Well, Mebh Ogamacatemera, your idea...

349
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:15,195
- Shh! Do you hear that?
- What?

350
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,531
A man. I'll get rid of him.

351
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:20,242
A man? Oh, no. Father.

352
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:23,161
Ah!

353
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:34,298
Just one townie.
I'll give him a bit of a scare.

354
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:35,716
No, stop.

355
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:38,302
Huh?

356
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:50,314
Hmm.

357
00:28:52,274 --> 00:28:53,275
Hmm.

358
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:03,702
Hmm.

359
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,079
Mm.

360
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,842
That was too close.

361
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:23,096
What are you so scared of?
We have a pack of wolves with us.

362
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:28,852
Hey, I told you.

363
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:34,024
You can't go out in the daytime.
Mammy said so. Go back to bed.

364
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:36,026
Is that your mummy back in the cave?

365
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:38,779
Of course! Sure don't I look like her?

366
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:42,616
And are any of the other wolves,
uh, people too?

367
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:45,494
No. Jeepers! Are you mad?

368
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:47,329
How big do you think my family is?

369
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:51,667
I'm not supposed to be out here.
Listen, I've got to get back.

370
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,795
Great, I'm mad to get rid of you.
Close your eyes.

371
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:55,879
What? Why?

372
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:58,799
Don't want you coming
back to my den. It's secret.

373
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:01,593
But I already found it.

374
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:03,387
Oh, just shut up and walk.

375
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,013
I'll point you back to the town.

376
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:07,140
No, I need my crossbow back first.

377
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:09,476
What do you need that for?
Shooting your bird again?

378
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,019
No, shooting...

379
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:13,230
Oh, never mind.

380
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:15,649
This way, hunter-townie-Robyn-girl.

381
00:30:20,946 --> 00:30:22,906
Hey! Stop pushing so fast.

382
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,575
Oh, will you stop complaining?

383
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:31,582
Smell that?

384
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:33,041
Ugh, Mebh.

385
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:38,005
Town tasties.

386
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:40,048
"Town tasties"?

387
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:44,052
What? Where's she gone now?

388
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,253
What did you tell them?

389
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:50,684
Just she's going home, isn't she?
'Tis obvious.

390
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:54,271
Ned, say if that wolf bit her, like,
could she turn into one of them?

391
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:55,189
A wolf?

392
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:59,026
No. One of them half-wolf,
half-witch, half-people?

393
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:01,862
Wolfwalkers? Will you stop?

394
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:05,115
We are cutting down their woods, Ned.
Shouldn't be doing it.

395
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:07,201
Save me from that nonsense.

396
00:31:07,284 --> 00:31:09,328
Seán Óg and the soldiers making us.

397
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:13,749
But if old Lord Ironside
doesn't sort out those wolves,

398
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:17,377
it won't just be us
who'll stop taking his orders.

399
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:19,588
No more orders for me, Ned.

400
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:21,798
Those town tasties are mine.

401
00:31:21,882 --> 00:31:24,718
I'm not after that.
I need my crossbow back.

402
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:28,722
Oh. All right.
But those town tasties are mine.

403
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:32,476
- No stuck-up lord in our city again.
- No, we won't, Ned.

404
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,977
Whee!

405
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:35,604
- What?
- What is it, Ned?

406
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:36,813
Uh, the wind, maybe.

407
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:40,651
Hey, what did you do with the spuds?

408
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:44,196
The spuds, Ned? Hey, the bread's gone too.

409
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,698
No spuds and no bread?

410
00:31:46,782 --> 00:31:49,868
- My hat. Give me my hat.
- My bread. Give me that.

411
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:51,620
Oh! There's someone in there!

412
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:52,704
What the...

413
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:54,108
My milk!

414
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:55,541
Something took my milk!

415
00:31:55,624 --> 00:31:58,836
Go! Go! Go!

416
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:04,967
They nearly caught us.

417
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:10,472
Nobody can catch me, townie.

418
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:17,312
How can you stand living in there?
All the smells. Ugh!

419
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:19,857
It is pretty smelly.

420
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:23,485
I don't like being stuck in there.

421
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:25,112
I miss England.

422
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:27,447
What's an "England"?

423
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:28,782
I used to live there.

424
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:31,952
I could go wherever I wanted,
play with my friends.

425
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:33,328
It was really nice.

426
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:35,247
Sounds like the forest.

427
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:38,959
Merlyn and I even used to help Father
hunt for food.

428
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:41,879
Now he wants me to stay in town
all the time.

429
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:44,882
Stay here in the forest. It's great.

430
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:47,759
- Loads of running.
- Playing.

431
00:32:47,843 --> 00:32:49,761
Eating, messing, climbing.

432
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:51,722
Free.

433
00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:57,102
I can't. I can't leave my father.

434
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:00,063
He has to work for the Lord Protector
and...

435
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:04,276
Mebh, you can't stay in the forest either.
They're cutting it all down.

436
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,528
No way! I'll scare them off.

437
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:10,073
The Lord Protector wants the wolves gone.
Dead! You have to leave.

438
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:13,827
We were leaving. Me, Mammy, with the pack.

439
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:14,912
What stopped you?

440
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:17,539
- Mammy went off.
- As a wolf?

441
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:20,417
Yeah, to find us a new place to live.

442
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:26,381
I'm sure it's some huge den
with no stinkers around and loads of food.

443
00:33:26,465 --> 00:33:29,968
It's going to be amazing!

444
00:33:30,052 --> 00:33:33,472
So then, where is she?
Do you think she got caught?

445
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:37,059
No. She's fine. Nobody can catch my mammy.

446
00:33:37,142 --> 00:33:41,939
And anyway, if she was caught by those
stinkers, I'd get my wolves to eat them!

447
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:44,650
So, you're waiting for her to come back?

448
00:33:45,234 --> 00:33:46,276
Yep.

449
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:52,032
It's just her and me in the whole world.

450
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:55,202
Like me and Father.

451
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:03,460
But what if they find the den?

452
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:05,921
No, they won't. Nobody has.

453
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:07,005
Well, I did.

454
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:09,550
Yeah. Only 'cause I let you.

455
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:28,110
I have to tell my father about you.

456
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:31,196
He didn't know...
We didn't know that Wolfwalkers are real.

457
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:37,870
That you were people. I better get back.

458
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,956
Aw.

459
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:43,375
Look, I'm gonna help you.

460
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:45,127
Wait for me at the big tree tomorrow.

461
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:49,172
I'll bring you some bread...
I mean, some "town tasties."

462
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:52,134
All right so. Smell you later, townie.

463
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:53,969
Not if I smell you first.

464
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:22,998
Oh. 'Tis yourself.

465
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:26,835
Mm. So, they didn't eat you? That's great.

466
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:29,421
You were right. That girl healed Merlyn.

467
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:32,299
Didn't she, now? I told you.

468
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:33,383
I better get back.

469
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:37,054
So, you'll know where to find me anyways
if you're looking for me.

470
00:35:39,473 --> 00:35:40,474
Father?

471
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:42,768
Father?

472
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:45,062
I've got to convince him.

473
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:48,273
Hmm. We need to tidy this place up
before he gets back.

474
00:35:57,324 --> 00:35:59,743
"My, Robyn, this place is sparkling."

475
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:03,038
Thank you, Father.
Take a seat. Put up your feet.

476
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,249
"Don't mind if I do, lass."

477
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:06,500
Hard day hunting?

478
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:09,044
"Aye. Not a sniff of wolf out there."

479
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:13,131
Well, what if I told you
I can get all the wolves to leave

480
00:36:13,215 --> 00:36:14,883
and we don't even have to kill them?

481
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:17,427
"I'd say you're telling tall tales again."

482
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:20,430
Oh, but I'm not.
Now, promise me you won't get angry.

483
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:21,682
"I promise."

484
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:25,269
You see, I met a girl in the forest
who has magic healing powers.

485
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:26,562
She healed Merlyn.

486
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:29,273
And she's a Wolfwalker.

487
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:31,108
"A Wolfwalker?"

488
00:36:31,525 --> 00:36:34,903
It's true. When she sleeps,
she turns into a wolf.

489
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:36,363
She can talk to the wolves.

490
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:38,520
Her and her mother were
going to take the wolves away,

491
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:41,535
- but her mother went missing.
- "Missing? Poor thing."

492
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:44,121
I know, but if we can
help her find her mother,

493
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:45,956
then they can
all leave the forest together,

494
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:48,458
and you will have done your duty
to the Lord Protector.

495
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:51,170
"Oh, brilliant, lass.
Absolutely brilliant.

496
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:52,963
Thank you. Our problems are solved.

497
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:55,132
We can go back to how things used to be."

498
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,181
My girl, come here to me.

499
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:06,351
Are you all right? How are you
after that wolf attack? A bit shaken?

500
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:08,437
No, I'm fine.
Take a seat. Put up your feet.

501
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:11,273
That's nice.

502
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,277
And how was your scullery work?
You must be tired, love.

503
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,529
Well, about that.
What if I told you I could...

504
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:21,158
And Merlyn is back.
My, you've had quite the day, lass.

505
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:23,285
Yes, I have. But what if I told you...

506
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:24,703
My day has been awful.

507
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:27,664
Every trap I set this week
has either been broken or sprung.

508
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:29,208
Never seen the like of these wolves.

509
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:32,711
Father, what if I told you
I can get all the wolves to leave

510
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:34,630
and you don't even have to kill them?

511
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:36,924
Now, promise you won't get angry with me.

512
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:38,008
Go on.

513
00:37:38,467 --> 00:37:39,510
You didn't promise.

514
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:41,303
I know. Go on. Tell me.

515
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:45,557
- You see, I went back to find Merlyn...
- You were out in the woods?

516
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:47,267
Father, listen. She's one of them.

517
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:49,853
A Wolfwalker,
like the woodcutter said. They're real!

518
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:51,438
- You went back?
- But, Father...

519
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:52,523
You left the scullery?

520
00:37:52,606 --> 00:37:54,900
Well, I didn't actually
get to the scullery.

521
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:57,194
What? The Lord Protector ordered...

522
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:58,892
- If we can just find her mother and...
- Listen!

523
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:01,448
You have to follow
the Lord Protector's rules.

524
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:03,867
He gave you a direct order
and you disobeyed him.

525
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:05,619
Have you no fear of the stocks?

526
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:09,122
We need to work together
to stay in this town, lass.

527
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:11,083
I'll bring you to the scullery
tomorrow myself.

528
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,585
But please,
I thought you would understand.

529
00:38:13,669 --> 00:38:15,546
I-I can help you. If we just...

530
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:20,217
Help me by doing your work
and staying in town, away from danger.

531
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:21,927
Now, promise me.

532
00:38:23,387 --> 00:38:24,429
I promise, Father.

533
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:26,557
All right. Now, go to your bed.

534
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,688
Mother would have listened to me.

535
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:36,525
She would have wanted you safe, Robyn.

536
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:38,819
Sleep well.

537
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:46,910
We'll find a way to help her, Merlyn.

538
00:39:27,618 --> 00:39:29,828
- Robyn?
- Father?

539
00:39:29,912 --> 00:39:32,748
- You all right?
- It's nothing.

540
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:34,208
Just a bad dream.

541
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:38,712
Well, should make an early start of it,
both of us. Let's go.

542
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:02,277
Oh, nice to have a new girl joining us.

543
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:03,695
- Keep an eye on her.
- Aye.

544
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:05,447
- She's to work the full day.
- Aye, aye.

545
00:40:05,531 --> 00:40:07,783
- Work is prayer, Robyn.
- 'Tis all right, child.

546
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:10,744
Sure wasn't I only half your age
when I started here.

547
00:40:10,827 --> 00:40:13,288
Just do what you're told now,
and you'll be grand.

548
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:15,874
It's for your own good, lass.

549
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:51,076
Work is prayer, girl.

550
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,870
Better if you don't stop.

551
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:20,772
Oh, no.

552
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,507
Girl.

553
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:51,678
Girl.

554
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:59,269
Girl.

555
00:42:07,819 --> 00:42:08,820
Girl.

556
00:42:11,198 --> 00:42:12,491
Girl.

557
00:42:12,574 --> 00:42:13,575
Girl!

558
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:16,411
Jesus, Mary, Joseph.
Get yourself out of this room, girl.

559
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:19,456
The Lord Protector has forbidden
anyone from entering.

560
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:22,793
You're lucky 'tis me that found you,
child, not His Lordship.

561
00:42:22,876 --> 00:42:24,545
Put you in the stocks, he would.

562
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:29,132
The Lord Protector expects his rules
to be followed. Remember that tomorrow.

563
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:31,385
Now, off home with you.

564
00:42:49,194 --> 00:42:51,780
Oh, now. There you are.

565
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:56,660
Did you see your new friend again?

566
00:42:56,743 --> 00:42:57,744
Robyn!

567
00:42:57,828 --> 00:42:59,955
Come in.
You'll catch your death out there.

568
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:07,129
Are you a hunter or a housemaid?

569
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:13,927
Work is prayer, Robyn.

570
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:16,138
Then I prayed the whole Bible.

571
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:17,764
Good lass.

572
00:43:20,392 --> 00:43:21,810
This is still new for you,

573
00:43:21,894 --> 00:43:24,104
but it's a righteous life
for a young lady.

574
00:43:24,188 --> 00:43:25,814
Well, it's no life for me.

575
00:43:25,898 --> 00:43:28,430
I can get the Wolfwalkers to leave.
You just need to listen to me...

576
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:30,485
Robyn Goodfellowe, enough of your stories.

577
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:31,570
I can go look for her...

578
00:43:31,653 --> 00:43:34,072
You must do as you're told.
No more fairy tales.

579
00:43:34,156 --> 00:43:35,157
- But the...
- No buts.

580
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,451
- The Wolfwalkers...
- Wolfwalkers are not real.

581
00:43:49,421 --> 00:43:52,549
They are real. Right, Merlyn?

582
00:44:25,832 --> 00:44:27,584
Huh?

583
00:44:28,168 --> 00:44:30,462
Merlyn, can you smell that?

584
00:44:31,046 --> 00:44:33,090
Merlyn, what's happened to you?

585
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:35,551
I can see your scent.

586
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:42,641
What? Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

587
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:50,315
What? What do I do? How did this happen?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

588
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:56,321
- Wolf! Wolf! Robyn, wake up!
- Father, help!

589
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:02,911
No, no, no, Father. It's me! Father!

590
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:19,457
What was that?

591
00:45:20,637 --> 00:45:21,972
Did you see that?

592
00:45:41,783 --> 00:45:42,993
Mebh!

593
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,180
Mebh!

594
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,389
Robyn!

595
00:46:05,057 --> 00:46:06,225
Something's happened to me.

596
00:46:06,308 --> 00:46:08,018
Yeah, I can see that.

597
00:46:08,101 --> 00:46:13,023
I thought I'd fixed the bite.
I thought you'd be fine.

598
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:15,234
Oh, Mammy's gonna kill me.

599
00:46:15,317 --> 00:46:17,277
Well, my father will kill me.

600
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:18,737
Huh?

601
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,615
Hey! Calm down and give her room!

602
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:24,034
Anyway, sin é. That's it.

603
00:46:24,117 --> 00:46:28,455
Now, I see you like this. It's flipping
great! I thought we were the last ones.

604
00:46:28,539 --> 00:46:30,374
It's great? I'm a Wolfwalker!

605
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:32,292
I know! Mammy said this would be bad,

606
00:46:32,376 --> 00:46:34,837
like, never to bite anyone, but I love it!

607
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,046
Is maith sin!

608
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:39,466
It is bad. I'll get killed like this.
What about my body?

609
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:42,177
It's asleep. Nice and cozy.

610
00:46:42,261 --> 00:46:46,807
Look, you're a wolf when you sleep,
a girl when you're awake. No big deal!

611
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:49,768
But the soldiers, and... and my father...

612
00:46:49,852 --> 00:46:54,106
Don't worry about that.
Learn how to be a wolf first. Come on.

613
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:59,820
Why do you want to be a human?
Being a wolf is way better. I'll show you.

614
00:47:01,822 --> 00:47:02,823
Can you smell me?

615
00:47:03,407 --> 00:47:05,367
Of course. Everybody can.

616
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:07,786
Well, close your eyes.

617
00:47:10,038 --> 00:47:12,624
You don't need your eyes to see.

618
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:17,004
And you can hear
every little thing that moves.

619
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:22,092
And your paws can hear
through the earth.

Well, townie, this is as far as we go.

666
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:51,575
The woods are getting smaller every day.

667
00:49:51,658 --> 00:49:57,331
I know. I try and scare them off...
but they just don't get it.

668
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:00,959
How about that?

669
00:50:03,462 --> 00:50:05,214
A lot of smelly people there.

670
00:50:05,297 --> 00:50:06,798
Hey, I'm in there.

671
00:50:06,882 --> 00:50:09,468
Fast asleep, snoring away.

672
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:19,728
I better go back. I'm scared, Mebh.

673
00:50:20,103 --> 00:50:22,481
Yeah. The town's no place for a wolf.

674
00:50:22,564 --> 00:50:25,317
I know. If they don't shoot me,
they'll cage me.

675
00:50:26,652 --> 00:50:29,488
Mebh, your mother.
Do you think they might've...

676
00:50:29,571 --> 00:50:32,741
No! Nobody can catch my mammy.

677
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:36,453
Sorry. How long has she been gone?

678
00:50:36,537 --> 00:50:37,538
Since...

679
00:50:38,956 --> 00:50:43,085
She's all right. She'll be back soon.
She promised.

680
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:47,881
Well, don't worry. Wherever she is,
we'll find her. I can help you.

681
00:50:47,965 --> 00:50:49,716
Yeah! There's two of us now.

682
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,623
I'll sneak out
and meet you back here tomorrow.

683
00:50:51,635 --> 00:50:54,388
I'll be waiting for you, again!

684
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:57,850
Mebh, we'll find her.
Then you can all leave and be safe.

685
00:50:58,392 --> 00:51:00,060
You promise?

686
00:51:00,143 --> 00:51:01,144
I promise.

687
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:22,499
Hmm.

688
00:52:11,089 --> 00:52:12,090
Huh?

689
00:52:30,734 --> 00:52:32,736
Hey, wolf! Get it!

690
00:52:33,779 --> 00:52:35,531
Wolf, there! Shoot!

691
00:52:39,284 --> 00:52:40,452
Wolf! Wolf in the town!

692
00:52:40,536 --> 00:52:42,037
- Wolf!
- Wolf in the town!

693
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,455
Oh, my God!

694
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:50,295
Lord Protector won't be happy!

695
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,020
- Open it now!
- The wolf!

696
00:52:58,303 --> 00:52:59,346
Wolf.

697
00:53:01,223 --> 00:53:02,391
Get it, now!

698
00:53:02,474 --> 00:53:04,514
- Yes, sir!
- Load your muskets! Surround the beast!

699
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:06,770
- Kill the wolf!
- Kill the wolf!

700
00:53:06,854 --> 00:53:08,438
Kill it! Kill the beast!

701
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:10,356
Fire!

702
00:53:12,943 --> 00:53:14,444
Get rid of that wolf!

703
00:53:15,654 --> 00:53:17,865
Goodfellowe, what is this?

704
00:53:20,075 --> 00:53:25,247
Enough! I will deal with this wolf myself.
Now, back to your beds.

705
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:34,661
- Do you see it?
- Where'd it go?

706
00:53:34,673 --> 00:53:36,329
Keep looking.
It's here somewhere.

707
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:53,817
That scent.

708
00:53:53,901 --> 00:53:55,974
- I knew it!
- Wolf in the castle!

709
00:53:55,986 --> 00:53:57,154
Do you see it?

710
00:53:57,237 --> 00:53:59,239
Search every corner.

711
00:53:59,615 --> 00:54:01,325
Don't let it get away!

712
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,369
Girl.

713
00:54:06,914 --> 00:54:07,915
Girl.

714
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:10,459
Girl, here. Quick.

715
00:54:24,932 --> 00:54:26,266
H-hello?

716
00:54:27,226 --> 00:54:30,729
Only a Wolfwalker can make another.
When did it happen to you? Where?

717
00:54:30,812 --> 00:54:33,232
Is the wolf that bit you near?
Is she all right?

718
00:54:33,315 --> 00:54:35,442
Is she alive? Where is Mebh?

719
00:54:37,778 --> 00:54:40,864
You're Mebh's mother.
Oh, wait till I tell her I found you.

720
00:54:40,948 --> 00:54:43,534
She'll be so happy.
She's waiting for you in the forest.

721
00:54:43,617 --> 00:54:45,869
You mean she's still here? In the woods?

722
00:54:45,953 --> 00:54:48,330
No, no, no! She must go!

723
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:50,707
But we have to rescue you.
How do I get you out?

724
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,377
Wolf! Wolf in the castle!

725
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,254
You'll be killed like this.

726
00:54:55,337 --> 00:54:57,410
Listen, girl, get back
to your human body right away.

727
00:54:57,422 --> 00:54:58,632
If I can just get the lo...

728
00:54:58,715 --> 00:55:00,801
She should never have bitten you.

729
00:55:00,884 --> 00:55:04,096
Get Mebh and leave.
It's not safe for our kind here.

730
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:06,974
- But Mebh won't leave without you.
- She must not come for me.

731
00:55:07,057 --> 00:55:10,227
She must not wait for me.
She must run. And you too, girl.

732
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:11,311
Now!

733
00:55:34,751 --> 00:55:37,254
Lord, what must I do?

734
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:40,382
I left to quell rebellion
and returned to more.

735
00:55:40,966 --> 00:55:44,136
This wild land must be civilized.

736
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:46,388
That is Your will.

737
00:55:52,769 --> 00:55:53,770
So, wolf,

738
00:55:53,854 --> 00:55:56,940
tomorrow I will show them
I have tamed you,

739
00:55:57,024 --> 00:55:59,651
just as I will tame this land.

740
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:05,115
They will have nothing to fear
if they trust in the Lord's will.

741
00:56:05,824 --> 00:56:07,451
- What the...
- Go!

742
00:56:09,411 --> 00:56:11,997
Tell Mebh to lead the pack to safety.

743
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,540
Go! Now!

744
00:56:49,868 --> 00:56:53,580
How do I do this? Um... Uh...
Come on, come on.

745
00:56:58,043 --> 00:56:59,211
Come on.

746
00:57:01,964 --> 00:57:04,007
Robyn, are you awake?

747
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:06,510
- What, Father?
- There was a wolf here in our chambers.

748
00:57:06,593 --> 00:57:08,929
Got in while you were sleeping.
It could have taken you.

749
00:57:09,012 --> 00:57:10,013
Father, I was...

750
00:57:10,097 --> 00:57:12,599
This world is such a dangerous
place for you, lass.

751
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:15,811
- I promised I would keep you safe.
- But that...

752
00:57:15,894 --> 00:57:17,020
Hmm?

753
00:57:18,939 --> 00:57:21,441
- Come with us.
- Lord Protector wants a word with you.

754
00:57:21,525 --> 00:57:23,277
Back, I say!

755
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,321
Ironsides! What are you doing about it?

756
00:57:28,866 --> 00:57:32,327
Goodfellowe.
A wolf here, threatening the town.

757
00:57:32,411 --> 00:57:35,706
It got inside the castle
in my very chambers.

758
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:37,624
- This is intolerable.
- Sir, I...

759
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:40,294
Enough! You have failed.
You are no hunter.

760
00:57:40,377 --> 00:57:43,630
From now on, you will serve in my ranks
as a foot soldier.

761
00:57:46,592 --> 00:57:50,637
- Townspeople! Order, please! Order! Order!
- Silence.

762
00:57:51,138 --> 00:57:53,140
Tomorrow, I will show you all.

763
00:57:53,223 --> 00:57:57,811
I will tame this land.
I will find that den.

764
00:57:57,895 --> 00:58:00,731
Every last wolf will be destroyed.

765
00:58:00,814 --> 00:58:02,441
No! Stop!

766
00:58:02,524 --> 00:58:03,609
There is another way!

767
00:58:03,692 --> 00:58:05,944
Release her, the Wolfwalker.

768
00:58:06,028 --> 00:58:08,197
Wha...

769
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,782
Please! You must listen!

770
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:12,743
Take her to the stocks.

771
00:58:12,826 --> 00:58:14,203
- No! Sir, please!
- Stop that!

772
00:58:14,286 --> 00:58:16,538
She's just a child.
And I know these woods.

773
00:58:16,622 --> 00:58:18,790
- I can still help you on your mission.
- Silence!

774
00:58:21,418 --> 00:58:24,213
It's safe now! Go to your beds!

775
00:58:24,296 --> 00:58:27,716
Tomorrow, I will make good on my word.

776
00:58:27,799 --> 00:58:29,092
Guards! Guards!

777
00:58:29,176 --> 00:58:32,471
- Move it! Move along, now!
- Get out of here!

778
00:58:32,554 --> 00:58:36,225
Goodfellowe,
I will give you both one more chance.

779
00:58:36,308 --> 00:58:38,727
Follow your orders
or you'll be off to war.

780
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:39,811
Yes, my lord.

781
00:58:39,895 --> 00:58:41,438
And, girl, come here.

782
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:45,943
Never speak of such pagan nonsense
in this town.

783
00:58:46,026 --> 00:58:50,572
Follow the rules or you will never see
your father again. Do you understand?

784
00:58:51,114 --> 00:58:52,533
Y-yes, my lord.

785
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:55,452
Double the guard. Bar the gate.

786
00:58:55,536 --> 00:58:58,413
No more wolves inside these walls.

787
00:58:58,497 --> 00:59:00,207
Yes, sir. On the double!

788
00:59:06,255 --> 00:59:10,467
Listen to me. We must follow our orders
if we are to stay together.

789
00:59:10,884 --> 00:59:13,554
You must do as you're told, my girl.

790
01:00:27,002 --> 01:00:31,089
Made a new friend, Mammy.
A townie, but a nice one.

791
01:00:31,632 --> 01:00:32,883
Her name is Robyn.

792
01:00:32,966 --> 01:00:35,761
She's taller than me, but I'm stronger.

793
01:00:35,844 --> 01:00:38,889
And she brushed my hair
and gave me this flower.

794
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:41,350
And she's from a place called England.

795
01:00:41,433 --> 01:00:43,685
And we're gonna meet
by the oak tree tomorrow.

796
01:00:44,186 --> 01:00:46,021
And she promised to help.

797
01:00:46,104 --> 01:00:49,233
And... And... Where are you?

798
01:00:50,317 --> 01:00:54,613
You promised you'd come back,
but it's been so long now.

799
01:00:55,155 --> 01:00:58,075
Are you lost?
Has something happened to you?

800
01:00:59,243 --> 01:01:02,955
Robyn will help me find you, Mammy.
She promised.

801
01:01:03,622 --> 01:01:05,165
There's two of us now.

802
01:01:07,876 --> 01:01:12,089
<i>♪ Seoithín seothó ♪</i>

803
01:01:12,172 --> 01:01:16,093
<i>♪ Seoithín seothó ♪</i>

804
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:25,853
Robyn, time for work.

805
01:01:40,117 --> 01:01:42,452
Merlyn, I can't get out to Mebh.

806
01:01:42,536 --> 01:01:44,913
Find her. Tell her to leave.

807
01:01:44,997 --> 01:01:48,834
Lead her away. She must go.

808
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:50,669
At least you can be free.

809
01:02:03,015 --> 01:02:04,558
It's for your own good, lass.

810
01:02:51,605 --> 01:02:53,649
Birdie! About time.

811
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:55,567
Robyn, what you took you so long?

812
01:02:58,403 --> 01:03:01,198
Robyn! Where are you?

813
01:03:03,575 --> 01:03:05,786
What do you mean
she can't come out of the town?

814
01:03:09,206 --> 01:03:13,085
I'm not leaving. She promised.
Help me find her, Merlyn.

815
01:03:46,994 --> 01:03:48,495
Where were you?

816
01:03:49,746 --> 01:03:51,248
Mebh, what are you doing here?

817
01:03:51,331 --> 01:03:53,792
I waited for ages!

818
01:03:53,876 --> 01:03:55,356
You're supposed to be gone from here.

819
01:03:55,419 --> 01:03:56,753
I sent Merlyn to tell you.

820
01:03:56,837 --> 01:03:59,256
Mm? What's that, girl?
Who are you talking to?

821
01:03:59,339 --> 01:04:00,924
Uh, oh, nobody.

822
01:04:01,008 --> 01:04:04,678
Oh. I've forgotten about them knots.
They're supposed to be done.

823
01:04:04,761 --> 01:04:07,181
You must go, Mebh.
Lead the pack away to safety.

824
01:04:07,264 --> 01:04:10,559
I told you. I'm not leaving
without my mammy.

825
01:04:14,313 --> 01:04:16,398
Mebh, you have to listen to me.

826
01:04:16,481 --> 01:04:19,026
You must leave the forest.
Take the wolves and go.

827
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:21,737
But... you said you'd help me.

828
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:25,282
- I am helping you, the only way I can.
- You promised.

829
01:04:25,365 --> 01:04:29,036
The Lord Protector will burn the woods.
He will kill all the wolves by sunset.

830
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:31,705
You have to get them out.
Do you understand?

831
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:35,292
Now go.

832
01:04:36,293 --> 01:04:40,923
You said you would help me. You promised.

833
01:04:41,006 --> 01:04:46,720
Go, Mebh.
Take Merlyn with you. Goodbye.

834
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,668
I hear he's got a wolf.

835
01:05:17,751 --> 01:05:21,463
I hear it's a giant beast to behold.
Much bigger than a wolf.

836
01:05:21,547 --> 01:05:24,550
- Mammy?
- Ah, won't that be a sight.

837
01:05:24,633 --> 01:05:28,679
Do you suppose he's going to kill it?

838
01:05:28,762 --> 01:05:31,515
Oh, yes. 'Tis a monster.

839
01:05:31,598 --> 01:05:33,684
- Mammy!
- Crazy child!

840
01:05:33,767 --> 01:05:35,215
- Careful, girl!
- Watch out!

841
01:05:35,227 --> 01:05:37,437
You'll hurt someone like that.

842
01:05:39,773 --> 01:05:43,235
Come on now, ladies.
Everyone's to go to the courtyard.

843
01:05:46,488 --> 01:05:50,659
The Lord Protector wants
everyone outside, girl. Come on.

844
01:05:53,704 --> 01:05:57,124
They brought out that big cage.
'Tis up on a stage.

845
01:05:57,207 --> 01:05:59,543
Oh, no.

846
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:12,222
Listen to me! I'm the best soldier!

847
01:06:12,306 --> 01:06:16,310
Push! Push! A little further.

848
01:06:17,978 --> 01:06:20,647
Good. That's enough. Step away.

849
01:06:20,731 --> 01:06:22,411
Return to your positions.

850
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:27,112
- Mebh, stop! Please.
- My mammy's here! Get off of me!

851
01:06:27,196 --> 01:06:28,780
Mebh. No!

852
01:06:30,449 --> 01:06:35,412
People of Kilkenny,
I have heard your concerns.

853
01:06:35,495 --> 01:06:41,460
Wolf attacks, livestock lost,
a wolf running through our very streets.

854
01:06:41,543 --> 01:06:44,505
- But listen to me. Have no fear.
- Mebh, stop.

855
01:06:45,756 --> 01:06:47,007
Get off of me!

856
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:48,800
You must get out of here now.

857
01:06:48,884 --> 01:06:51,970
Let me go. Let me go.

858
01:06:52,054 --> 01:06:55,724
Hey! Hey! Over here! I've caught a wolf.

859
01:06:55,807 --> 01:06:59,478
- ...a civilized country.
- Look! She caught the wolf.

860
01:06:59,561 --> 01:07:00,841
We cannot be...

861
01:07:00,896 --> 01:07:04,024
My fellow hunters,
we have a new wolf to kill.

862
01:07:04,107 --> 01:07:06,068
No. No!

863
01:07:06,151 --> 01:07:07,986
Get off of me!

864
01:07:09,613 --> 01:07:13,075
I have to find my mammy. Get away from me.

865
01:07:13,158 --> 01:07:16,328
Robyn, stop. What are you doing?

866
01:07:17,704 --> 01:07:20,832
I'm gonna eat you all! Let me out!

867
01:07:20,916 --> 01:07:23,418
Mebh, your mother told me
to keep you safe.

868
01:07:23,502 --> 01:07:26,046
You liar! You knew!

869
01:07:27,714 --> 01:07:30,300
This is for your own good. I'm sorry.

870
01:07:30,384 --> 01:07:32,123
Get the wolf, wolf...

871
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:36,181
I have been sent here
by the Lord himself

872
01:07:36,265 --> 01:07:38,934
to conquer the wild.

873
01:07:39,017 --> 01:07:44,064
And I will show you it can be tamed.
Behold.

874
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:52,155
- Wolf!
- Mammy!

875
01:07:54,032 --> 01:07:55,784
- Kill the wolf!
- Kill the wolf!

876
01:07:57,536 --> 01:07:58,871
Kill the wolf!

877
01:07:58,954 --> 01:08:00,080
Kill the beast!

878
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:06,170
He has got a wolf.

879
01:08:06,253 --> 01:08:10,591
Enough! That's enough! Calm! Calm!

880
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:14,678
You have nothing to fear from this beast.

881
01:08:14,761 --> 01:08:17,346
Now, open the gate.

882
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:39,036
- Kill that wolf.
- Come on now.

883
01:08:41,496 --> 01:08:46,667
You see? This once wild creature
is now tamed.

884
01:08:46,752 --> 01:08:50,339
Obedient. A mere faithful servant.

885
01:08:52,508 --> 01:08:56,886
I will rid our land
of all its wretched kind.

886
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:59,765
Mammy. Mammy! Mammy!

887
01:09:01,558 --> 01:09:04,060
Mebh, no!

888
01:09:09,066 --> 01:09:10,817
Hey!

889
01:09:10,901 --> 01:09:13,319
Mammy, Mammy. It's me. I'm here.

890
01:09:13,403 --> 01:09:15,267
- What's this? What's going on here?
- I'm here, Mammy.

891
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:18,200
Let her go! That's my mammy!

892
01:09:19,785 --> 01:09:21,036
Let her go!

893
01:09:21,662 --> 01:09:24,038
Goodfellowe, take charge
of this wild thing.

894
01:09:35,341 --> 01:09:38,136
Goodfellowe, can you not catch anything?
What are you doing?

895
01:09:41,723 --> 01:09:43,642
Collar that demon
and put her in the stock.

896
01:09:43,725 --> 01:09:46,019
Father! No!

897
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:53,861
- Guards!
- Stop!

898
01:09:53,944 --> 01:09:55,559
Don't move.

899
01:09:55,571 --> 01:09:57,906
Hold it right there, you wildling.

900
01:10:00,325 --> 01:10:02,494
Father! Don't! No!

901
01:10:02,578 --> 01:10:03,829
Robyn! Stay back!

902
01:10:05,539 --> 01:10:07,916
Father, stop! This is wrong!

903
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,501
Robyn! Get away from here!

904
01:10:10,169 --> 01:10:11,461
Whoa!

905
01:10:15,549 --> 01:10:17,080
- A soldier's been bitten!
- Father!

906
01:10:17,092 --> 01:10:18,886
The wolf bit him!

907
01:10:19,928 --> 01:10:21,930
Pull it back. Pull it back.

908
01:10:22,014 --> 01:10:23,390
- Whoa!
- That's it.

909
01:10:23,473 --> 01:10:25,213
- Whoa!
- Lock it up!

910
01:10:25,225 --> 01:10:28,187
- Oh, no, you don't!
- Cover it, now!

911
01:10:28,645 --> 01:10:30,230
Mammy!

912
01:10:32,232 --> 01:10:35,277
Mammy. What have they done?

913
01:10:47,706 --> 01:10:50,042
Huh?

914
01:10:54,213 --> 01:10:55,339
Come here, you.

915
01:10:55,422 --> 01:10:56,423
Ow!

916
01:11:00,177 --> 01:11:03,722
I am a Wolfwalker!

917
01:11:03,805 --> 01:11:07,559
I'm getting my wolves
and coming back for my mammy!

918
01:11:07,643 --> 01:11:10,145
Then we'll eat you all!

919
01:11:22,449 --> 01:11:26,119
People! Listen to me. Listen to me.

920
01:11:26,203 --> 01:11:30,832
Do not fear wild girls and wolves

921
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:34,169
because tonight we put an end to this.

922
01:11:34,253 --> 01:11:38,090
I will burn this forest to the ground.

923
01:11:38,173 --> 01:11:41,510
I will lead cannons
to the den of these beasts

924
01:11:41,593 --> 01:11:44,930
- and send them all to hell.
- No!

925
01:11:45,013 --> 01:11:48,851
We shall prevail. It is the Lord's will.

926
01:11:49,393 --> 01:11:51,153
- Prepare a squadron.
- Yes, sir.

927
01:11:51,228 --> 01:11:52,884
- Move along.
- Get a move on.

928
01:11:52,896 --> 01:11:54,356
Move along.

929
01:11:54,439 --> 01:11:58,402
Goodfellowe, what have you become?
You can't even catch a little girl?

930
01:11:58,944 --> 01:12:01,530
Prove yourself a worthy soldier tonight

931
01:12:01,613 --> 01:12:03,699
or tomorrow you are in chains.

932
01:12:03,782 --> 01:12:06,577
Now, put an end to that wild beast.

933
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:09,246
What cannot be tamed must be destroyed.

934
01:12:09,329 --> 01:12:11,623
No, please. You can't.

935
01:12:11,707 --> 01:12:13,041
Robyn! Stop this.

936
01:12:13,125 --> 01:12:18,797
And for heaven's sake, put manners on
that girl, or manners will be put on her.

937
01:12:34,396 --> 01:12:38,734
- Over here. Come on.
- Steady, steady. Move along.

938
01:12:38,817 --> 01:12:41,820
- Come on, lads. Let's go...
- Off home, you lot.

939
01:12:41,904 --> 01:12:43,780
Off the castle grounds.

940
01:12:44,364 --> 01:12:46,283
No, please. Father, please don't.

941
01:12:46,366 --> 01:12:48,410
Enough. Robyn, return to your duties.

942
01:12:48,493 --> 01:12:50,579
- But you can't.
- Now, girl!

943
01:13:08,388 --> 01:13:12,309
Hurry! With that weapon,
our victory is at hand.

944
01:13:25,697 --> 01:13:27,407
Robyn, what are you doing, girl?

945
01:13:27,491 --> 01:13:29,993
The Lord Protector will have us in chains.

946
01:13:30,077 --> 01:13:33,622
He's wrong, Father. All this is wrong.
Don't you see that?

947
01:13:33,705 --> 01:13:36,416
Robyn, step aside.
We must do what we're told.

948
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,168
Why, Father? Why?

949
01:13:38,252 --> 01:13:39,378
I'm afraid.

950
01:13:40,963 --> 01:13:42,172
I'm afraid.

951
01:13:42,256 --> 01:13:43,257
Father?

952
01:13:44,758 --> 01:13:47,135
I won't be here to protect you forever.

953
01:13:47,219 --> 01:13:50,681
I'm so afraid that one day
you will end up in a cage.

954
01:13:52,558 --> 01:13:54,393
But I already am in a cage.

955
01:13:55,519 --> 01:13:57,145
Wolves! Wolves!

956
01:14:00,065 --> 01:14:01,775
Wolves! Wolves!

957
01:14:10,284 --> 01:14:11,618
- What is happening?
- Huh?

958
01:14:17,249 --> 01:14:18,750
I'm sorry, Father.

959
01:14:20,169 --> 01:14:22,546
Robyn!

960
01:14:22,629 --> 01:14:24,381
- The beast is loose!
- What the...

961
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:26,633
No!

962
01:14:27,676 --> 01:14:29,344
Grab her!

963
01:14:30,512 --> 01:14:31,847
Cover the gate!

964
01:14:33,515 --> 01:14:35,851
- Lower the gate!
- Incoming!

965
01:14:35,934 --> 01:14:36,977
Fire!

966
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:38,395
- No!
- Don't let it get away!

967
01:14:41,148 --> 01:14:43,275
I tried to stop her, but I failed.

968
01:14:43,358 --> 01:14:44,943
She's gonna get herself killed.

969
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:48,655
It's coming this way!

970
01:14:51,783 --> 01:14:55,078
Go on, then!

971
01:14:55,162 --> 01:14:56,788
Shut the gates!

972
01:14:57,581 --> 01:14:59,124
Draw the bridge up!

973
01:15:03,337 --> 01:15:04,671
Ready your arms!

974
01:15:04,755 --> 01:15:06,048
Go.

975
01:15:06,131 --> 01:15:07,341
Fire!

976
01:15:07,424 --> 01:15:08,967
Aim for the beast!

977
01:15:11,094 --> 01:15:13,764
Wolf!

978
01:15:13,847 --> 01:15:14,848
Watch out!

979
01:15:33,492 --> 01:15:36,411
It's time for us to attack those townies!

980
01:15:36,495 --> 01:15:38,038
Let's eat them all!

981
01:15:38,121 --> 01:15:39,706
They have my...

982
01:15:44,419 --> 01:15:45,420
Mammy?

983
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:52,427
Mammy.

984
01:15:56,890 --> 01:16:00,936
Mammy! Mammy.

985
01:16:06,942 --> 01:16:08,193
Mammy, you're back.

986
01:16:08,277 --> 01:16:10,821
Mebh. Mm.

987
01:16:13,949 --> 01:16:18,495
I thought I would never see you again...
until this one freed me.

988
01:16:25,127 --> 01:16:27,754
Mebh, I'm so sorry.

989
01:16:27,838 --> 01:16:32,676
I was only trying to keep you safe.
Trying to help. I didn't know what to do.

990
01:16:32,759 --> 01:16:33,760
I was...

991
01:16:35,179 --> 01:16:37,097
- I'm sorry, Mebh.
- Ugh.

992
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:45,647
Aw, come here to me, townie.

993
01:16:52,487 --> 01:16:54,656
I'm not a townie anymore, Mebh.

994
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:56,116
Thanks for helping Mammy.

995
01:17:01,788 --> 01:17:03,290
No!

996
01:17:03,373 --> 01:17:07,961
Mammy! No, no!
Mammy, what happened to you? No!

997
01:17:08,045 --> 01:17:11,089
Mammy! Mammy! No!

998
01:17:11,173 --> 01:17:12,424
Robyn!

999
01:17:12,508 --> 01:17:14,218
- Mammy!
- Robyn! Run! Quick!

1000
01:17:14,301 --> 01:17:15,928
Mammy, what happened to you?

1001
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:17,012
No, Father!

1002
01:17:17,095 --> 01:17:19,097
- Come on, Robyn!
- No, Father!

1003
01:17:19,181 --> 01:17:21,642
- You shot her! How could you?
- Come on! Robyn! Run!

1004
01:17:21,725 --> 01:17:23,227
Let me go! Mebh!

1005
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:26,021
- I have to help her! Let me go!
- Back!

1006
01:17:26,104 --> 01:17:27,689
- I said back! Stay back!
- No!

1007
01:17:27,773 --> 01:17:29,483
- What have you done?
- Get back! Get back!

1008
01:17:29,566 --> 01:17:30,776
Get away from here!

1009
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:42,913
Huh?

1010
01:18:27,749 --> 01:18:30,043
Stop! No! Let me go!

1011
01:18:30,127 --> 01:18:31,712
- Robyn! No! Stay!
- Stop!

1012
01:18:31,795 --> 01:18:33,380
Mebh!

1013
01:18:33,463 --> 01:18:34,965
No!

1014
01:18:35,048 --> 01:18:37,384
I have to help her! She's dying!

1015
01:18:37,467 --> 01:18:38,802
Come on, Robyn!

1016
01:18:39,219 --> 01:18:40,512
Let me go!

1017
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:42,681
Mebh! Mebh!

1018
01:18:42,764 --> 01:18:45,225
No, Robyn! Why? I don't understand!

1019
01:18:45,309 --> 01:18:50,022
Don't you see?
I'm one of them. I'm a Wolfwalker.

1020
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:56,069
No, Robyn. Please.
Stay with me. I can't let you go.

1021
01:18:56,570 --> 01:18:57,571
Father.

1022
01:19:09,917 --> 01:19:10,918
Robyn.

1023
01:19:14,963 --> 01:19:16,048
Robyn!

1024
01:19:27,559 --> 01:19:29,382
- Forward!
- Ready arms.

1025
01:19:29,394 --> 01:19:31,154
Formation!

1026
01:19:31,688 --> 01:19:35,734
Goodfellowe, have you lost your senses?
What is going on here?

1027
01:19:35,817 --> 01:19:38,070
Robyn, she... She's gone.

1028
01:19:38,862 --> 01:19:41,740
- Chain him. We'll deal with him later.
- Yes, sir.

1029
01:19:44,076 --> 01:19:45,953
That's a fresh track.

1030
01:19:46,411 --> 01:19:48,789
Move on! Burn it all!

1031
01:19:48,872 --> 01:19:50,374
Yes, sir. Forward.

1032
01:19:50,457 --> 01:19:51,988
- Hold still.
- Forward.

1033
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,795
- Burn the woods!
- Burn it down!

1034
01:20:41,466 --> 01:20:43,719
Oh, God, what have I done?

1035
01:20:43,802 --> 01:20:48,223
Robyn... Robyn, wake up, please. Please.

1036
01:21:02,404 --> 01:21:03,405
Mammy!

1037
01:21:05,532 --> 01:21:07,659
Please, Mammy, breathe.

1038
01:21:09,411 --> 01:21:15,125
I've never healed anything this
bad before. It's gonna take time.

1039
01:21:15,209 --> 01:21:17,628
I'm not leaving you, Mammy.

1040
01:21:21,298 --> 01:21:22,424
Huh?

1041
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:36,063
I'll hold them off.

1042
01:21:38,232 --> 01:21:39,233
Follow her.

1043
01:21:44,655 --> 01:21:46,198
- Watch it, boys!
- Ready arms!

1044
01:21:46,281 --> 01:21:47,908
Get ready to march!

1045
01:21:53,497 --> 01:21:55,415
They're in there! Advance!

1046
01:21:55,499 --> 01:21:57,584
Aye, sir! Forward, men!

1047
01:22:00,045 --> 01:22:03,590
Continue onward. Push, men! Push!

1048
01:22:07,427 --> 01:22:09,680
We can drive them back. We are wolves!

1049
01:22:09,763 --> 01:22:12,599
- Formation!
- They have guns. A cannon.

1050
01:22:13,851 --> 01:22:17,437
But don't be afraid.
They're in our forest. Let's go!

1051
01:22:20,023 --> 01:22:21,680
- Brave on!
- Push, men, push!

1052
01:22:21,692 --> 01:22:22,734
Keep going!

1053
01:22:23,694 --> 01:22:26,196
Load your weapons.

1054
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:29,074
- Burn them out. Pick them off!
- Yes, sir!

1055
01:22:29,449 --> 01:22:30,784
- Spread out!
- More fire!

1056
01:22:30,868 --> 01:22:32,828
- Over here!
- Burn it!

1057
01:22:32,911 --> 01:22:34,580
- Huh?
- Burn the woods!

1058
01:22:34,663 --> 01:22:35,664
Onward!

1059
01:22:39,668 --> 01:22:42,588
- Hey, more fire over here!
- Burn it down!

1060
01:22:44,423 --> 01:22:47,759
What on Earth is this?

1061
01:23:01,648 --> 01:23:02,649
Spread out!

1062
01:23:02,733 --> 01:23:05,152
Get more fire going over here!

1063
01:23:05,235 --> 01:23:06,820
Take cover in the trees.

1064
01:23:06,904 --> 01:23:08,071
Huh?

1065
01:23:08,155 --> 01:23:09,698
Use the traps.

1066
01:23:09,781 --> 01:23:11,408
Oh, bloody hell!

1067
01:23:11,491 --> 01:23:12,618
Draw their fire.

1068
01:23:14,119 --> 01:23:16,159
Then strike from the shadows
when they're reloading.

1069
01:23:17,998 --> 01:23:20,584
Report? Report?

1070
01:23:32,262 --> 01:23:33,847
No!

1071
01:23:35,098 --> 01:23:37,351
I can't, Mammy. I can't.

1072
01:23:37,434 --> 01:23:39,019
I'm not strong enough.

1073
01:23:39,102 --> 01:23:42,356
Please, tell me what to do.

1074
01:23:50,781 --> 01:23:53,867
The pack. I need the pack.

1075
01:23:57,496 --> 01:23:59,289
What? What is that?

1076
01:24:03,752 --> 01:24:06,547
Run!

1077
01:24:22,938 --> 01:24:24,940
Dear God. What was that?

1078
01:24:25,524 --> 01:24:28,277
It's a Wolfwalker.

1079
01:24:30,654 --> 01:24:32,865
Witchcraft.

1080
01:24:32,948 --> 01:24:36,493
- Run! Get out of here!
- What do you think you're doing?

1081
01:24:36,577 --> 01:24:38,036
Reform your ranks!

1082
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,621
Get back to your positions!

1083
01:24:39,705 --> 01:24:41,206
- We're surrounded.
- Run!

1084
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:42,749
Huh?

1085
01:24:47,921 --> 01:24:49,548
Have mercy! Have mercy!

1086
01:24:53,051 --> 01:24:56,388
Fire! Fire at will!

1087
01:24:56,471 --> 01:24:57,723
Fire!

1088
01:24:59,266 --> 01:25:00,601
They're everywhere!

1089
01:25:14,114 --> 01:25:15,115
Robyn.

1090
01:25:19,995 --> 01:25:21,997
Robyn, go!

1091
01:25:27,169 --> 01:25:29,838
Gunners, don't let them get away!

1092
01:25:30,547 --> 01:25:33,175
Slay the foul beasts!

1093
01:25:43,227 --> 01:25:47,439
Quick! Everyone, down here.
I need your help.

1094
01:25:53,612 --> 01:25:54,613
Robyn?

1095
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,365
Where's Robyn?

1096
01:26:05,457 --> 01:26:09,002
Men, run and you will be killed!

1097
01:26:09,086 --> 01:26:12,172
Follow my command and we will prevail.

1098
01:26:13,507 --> 01:26:15,425
The Lord is guiding us.

1099
01:26:17,719 --> 01:26:19,638
Robyn.

1100
01:26:20,597 --> 01:26:22,057
Forward!

1101
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:23,475
Load the cannon!

1102
01:26:23,559 --> 01:26:25,519
Aye, sir.

1103
01:26:47,791 --> 01:26:51,712
Show yourselves, you wicked creatures.

1104
01:26:51,795 --> 01:26:54,214
Come, meet your end.

1105
01:27:02,306 --> 01:27:05,434
There it is, the devil's lair!

1106
01:27:05,517 --> 01:27:07,728
Our victory is at hand!

1107
01:27:07,811 --> 01:27:09,479
Gunners, fire!

1108
01:27:12,024 --> 01:27:13,483
Take cover!

1109
01:27:13,901 --> 01:27:16,403
Robyn!

1110
01:27:18,405 --> 01:27:19,990
Musketeers...

1111
01:27:20,073 --> 01:27:22,242
fire!

1112
01:27:25,829 --> 01:27:27,247
Get back here!

1113
01:27:29,374 --> 01:27:31,335
No, Robyn!

1114
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:41,011
Robyn?

1115
01:27:41,094 --> 01:27:42,471
Robyn?

1116
01:27:46,141 --> 01:27:48,477
Robyn, get up.

1117
01:27:56,401 --> 01:27:58,403
Get up! Run!

1118
01:27:58,487 --> 01:28:01,573
Enough, Goodfellowe.

1119
01:28:08,205 --> 01:28:09,456
Foul bird!

1120
01:28:12,876 --> 01:28:14,962
Stop! She's just a girl.

1121
01:28:15,045 --> 01:28:19,842
By God's glory and punishment,
he vanquishes thee.

1122
01:28:20,425 --> 01:28:23,887
Robyn! No!

1123
01:28:39,236 --> 01:28:41,613
Lord God Almighty, protect me.

1124
01:29:41,131 --> 01:29:42,132
Goodfellowe.

1125
01:30:37,271 --> 01:30:39,398
Into your arms, my Lord...

1126
01:30:42,234 --> 01:30:44,444
I commend my soul.

1127
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:04,381
Father?

1128
01:31:11,096 --> 01:31:13,265
Father.

1129
01:31:17,853 --> 01:31:19,354
We have to help Mebh.

1130
01:31:38,415 --> 01:31:41,210
Please, Mammy, don't go. Don't go.

1131
01:31:41,752 --> 01:31:43,420
Don't leave me again.

1132
01:31:43,504 --> 01:31:44,796
Please.

1133
01:31:45,547 --> 01:31:46,548
Mebh.

1134
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:49,343
Robyn.

1135
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:53,263
I tried. I really tried,

1136
01:31:53,347 --> 01:31:55,474
but I'm just not strong enough.

1137
01:31:58,352 --> 01:31:59,978
I need her.

1138
01:32:00,521 --> 01:32:03,023
I can help like I promised.

1139
01:32:03,106 --> 01:32:05,734
Mebh, there's two of us now.

1140
01:32:08,987 --> 01:32:10,781
There's two of us now.

1141
01:32:11,615 --> 01:32:14,409
Show me what to do, Mebh.
I don't know how.

1142
01:32:14,493 --> 01:32:17,079
I'll show you. Follow me.

1143
01:32:53,615 --> 01:32:55,742
- What is that?
- Sorcery.

1144
01:33:12,718 --> 01:33:13,760
Jeepers.

1145
01:33:15,053 --> 01:33:18,807
Do you hear that, huh?
'Tis lovely music altogether.

1146
01:34:09,566 --> 01:34:12,194
- Mebh.
- Mammy.

1147
01:34:12,277 --> 01:34:15,489
Oh, Mebh, my little wolf.

1148
01:34:15,572 --> 01:34:16,740
Mammy, you're back.

1149
01:34:19,910 --> 01:34:23,080
I thought you were gone again.
I've missed you.

1150
01:34:25,999 --> 01:34:28,335
Thank you, mo chara.

1151
01:34:28,919 --> 01:34:30,170
My friend.

1152
01:34:46,311 --> 01:34:47,312
Father.

1153
01:34:48,981 --> 01:34:50,315
Don't go.

1154
01:34:54,194 --> 01:34:56,071
Stay, please.

1155
01:34:56,154 --> 01:34:57,823
You're one of us.

1156
01:35:04,913 --> 01:35:07,749
Father, you're in our pack now.

1157
01:35:41,658 --> 01:35:43,076
All is well, my love.

1158
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,703
All is well, Father.

1159
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:54,963
Come on!

1160
01:35:57,382 --> 01:35:59,134
Race you!

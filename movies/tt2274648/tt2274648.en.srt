00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:16,211
<i>The year is 517 A.D.,</i>

3
00:00:16,213 --> 00:00:17,780
<i>known as the Dark Ages</i>

4
00:00:17,782 --> 00:00:20,783
<i>and for fucking good reason.</i>

5
00:00:20,785 --> 00:00:22,952
<i>An endless war
between the armies of man</i>

6
00:00:22,954 --> 00:00:24,287
<i>and the creatures of darkness</i>

7
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:25,955
<i>has raged across Britain.</i>

8
00:00:25,957 --> 00:00:29,459
<i>And in retribution for man's
injustices to creatures,</i>

9
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:32,428
<i>the immortal witch
Vivienne Nimue</i>

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,430
<i>had spread her deadly plague</i>

11
00:00:34,432 --> 00:00:38,333
<i>threatening to wipe mankind
off the face of the Earth.</i>

12
00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:41,840
<i>And so at Pendle Hill,
beneath an ancient oak tree,</i>

13
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:47,644
<i>King Arthur...
Yes, that King Arthur,</i>

14
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:49,880
<i>and his powerful
wizard Merlin,</i>

15
00:00:49,882 --> 00:00:52,816
<i>were forced to surrender
to Nimue,</i>

16
00:00:52,818 --> 00:00:54,854
<i>the Queen of Blood.</i>

17
00:00:56,354 --> 00:00:58,422
Well, well, well.

18
00:00:58,424 --> 00:01:02,358
The great King Arthur
comes to Pendle Hill.

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,228
<i>However,
believing man and monster</i>

20
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,997
<i>were never meant
to live in harmony,</i>

21
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:08,766
<i>Arthur ambushed Nimue.</i>

22
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:25,381
<i>Betrayed by her most trusted
witch, Ganeida.</i>

23
00:01:25,383 --> 00:01:28,587
No mortal weapon
can harm me.

24
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:34,892
- Excalibur!
- This is no mortal weapon.

25
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:37,861
<i>Pissed off,</i>

26
00:01:37,863 --> 00:01:40,698
<i>Nimue unleashed
her deadly plague.</i>

27
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,933
No!

28
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,837
<i>With one swing</i>

29
00:01:45,404 --> 00:01:48,304
<i>of his legendary sword,</i>

30
00:01:48,306 --> 00:01:50,776
<i>Arthur severed
the Blood Queen's head.</i>

31
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:55,546
<i>But even that wasn't enough
to stop her.</i>

32
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:58,049
<i>So he had her cut up
into pieces,</i>

33
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,852
<i>each one locked
in a separate casket.</i>

34
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:04,789
This is not over.
I am vengeance eternal!

35
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,992
No!

36
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,662
<i>Sealed with a holy prayer.</i>

37
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,596
Only the words
from a man of God

38
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:14,331
may break this holy seal.

39
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,935
<i>Arthur then
ordered his bravest knights</i>

40
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,436
<i>to ride off and bury
her wretched remains</i>

41
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:21,005
<i>in the far reaches
of the land,</i>

42
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,575
<i>where no one would
ever find her.</i>

43
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:27,013
<i>Not even the devil himself.</i>

44
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,156
<i>I mean it, son.</i>

45
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,693
<i>No drinking, no fighting,
don't cause a scene.</i>

46
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:44,596
Relax, Dad. It's not
my first time in Tijuana.

47
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,598
<i>Why do you think
I'm telling you all this?</i>

48
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,768
Ruiz is my friend.
I just wanna bring him back.

49
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,971
<i>Agent Ruiz
is not your friend.</i>

50
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:53,505
<i>He's someone
you get drunk with.</i>

51
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,406
<i>Three weeks ago,
we sent Ruiz</i>

52
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,408
<i>to investigate
a nest of vampires.</i>

53
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,778
<i>We haven't heard
from him since.</i>

54
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,844
I'm on it.

55
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,113
A reliable source told me
where I can find him.

56
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,715
<i>Call me
when you have him.</i>

57
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:04,949
I'm not
going to call you.

58
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:07,719
<i>Just call me!
It's a simple extraction.</i>

59
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,487
<i>Get Ruiz out of there</i>
<i>and bid</i> adios

60
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,656
<i>without making
a big mess. Again.</i>

61
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,525
I got this, Dad!

62
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,531
You know me,
I have a gentle touch.

63
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:19,965
Ah, shit! Not again.

64
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:55,634
Camazotz! Camazotz! Camazotz!

65
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:58,838
Camazotz! Camazotz! Camazotz!

66
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,756
Uh...

67
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:28,969
Ruiz! Esteban, is that you?

68
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:37,879
Camazotz!
Camazotz! Camazotz! Camazotz!

69
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:42,215
What's up with
the Camazotz crap, huh?

70
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:44,684
The B.P.R.D.
sends you down here,

71
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:46,920
investigate a nest of vampires

72
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:49,055
and you went silent
about three weeks ago.

73
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:49,990
I miss you, man.

74
00:04:49,992 --> 00:04:52,859
Come on, I'm here
to bring you back in.

75
00:04:52,861 --> 00:04:54,461
Come on, buddy, let's go.

76
00:04:55,898 --> 00:04:59,633
So come on, bring me in.

77
00:05:05,207 --> 00:05:06,675
Okay.

78
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:10,112
Okay.

79
00:05:20,757 --> 00:05:24,257
Okay. Hey,
what happened to you, man?

80
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:26,128
What's with the get-up, huh?

81
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:30,597
Training? Training for what?

82
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:31,767
To kill you!

83
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:37,472
Okay. Hang on to that for me.

84
00:05:39,175 --> 00:05:40,610
You look good in purple.

85
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:45,215
Ouch!

86
00:05:50,086 --> 00:05:51,886
It's been a lot of fun.

87
00:05:51,888 --> 00:05:53,189
Can we get out of here?

88
00:05:56,893 --> 00:05:59,894
What did they do to you?

89
00:06:05,868 --> 00:06:08,569
Ruiz! Let's have a drink
and talk about this!

90
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:10,638
You're a good agent!

91
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,108
Buddy, come on.
Come on, don't you remember?

92
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,578
Backyards? Drinking beers
on the porch?

93
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,814
We used to play guitar, man!

94
00:06:19,816 --> 00:06:23,551
You'd play
all that hippy acoustic crap

95
00:06:23,553 --> 00:06:25,922
and I'd play real music.

96
00:06:30,593 --> 00:06:32,728
To hell with this!

97
00:06:36,065 --> 00:06:37,798
Hey, I'm sorry, man.

98
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,868
Are you okay?

99
00:06:43,107 --> 00:06:45,806
Come on, I don't wanna
hurt you, partner.

100
00:06:45,808 --> 00:06:47,843
I know you're in there
somewhere. Talk to me.

101
00:06:47,845 --> 00:06:49,678
You play the hero,

102
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,847
but I really know
what is under your mask.

103
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:56,018
Oh, yeah? Is that so?
Let's see what's under yours.

104
00:07:14,872 --> 00:07:17,741
Ruiz! Stop this!

105
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:38,695
No! No!

106
00:07:43,134 --> 00:07:44,302
Ruiz.

107
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:54,377
I know you...
Anung un Rama.

108
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:58,081
Your heart beats with rage.

109
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:02,787
I know which side
you'll choose at the end.

110
00:08:04,222 --> 00:08:06,255
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:06,257 --> 00:08:08,726
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean... I...

112
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:02,145
That's okay, little guy.

113
00:09:02,147 --> 00:09:04,448
You're just doing
what you're doing.

114
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,051
I'm not judging.

115
00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:09,088
Hellboy.

116
00:09:09,855 --> 00:09:11,423
No, it's Josh.

117
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,893
People confuse us
all the time.

118
00:09:15,895 --> 00:09:17,663
Come on, we gotta go.

119
00:09:18,264 --> 00:09:19,897
How did you find me?

120
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:22,333
Twitter.
You don't exactly blend.

121
00:09:22,335 --> 00:09:25,502
Look, sorry about Ruiz,
but we gotta take you back.

122
00:09:25,504 --> 00:09:28,172
You can try!

123
00:09:28,174 --> 00:09:30,340
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come on, big guy. Easy.

124
00:09:30,342 --> 00:09:32,176
We're just following orders.

125
00:09:32,178 --> 00:09:33,812
He wants you back.

126
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:36,113
The old man sent you?

127
00:09:36,115 --> 00:09:37,881
All he told us
is its important.

128
00:09:37,883 --> 00:09:39,219
We need to go.

129
00:09:50,196 --> 00:09:51,697
They're buying.

130
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:28,567
<i>Details are still emerging</i>

131
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:30,935
<i>with regard to the tragic
events in Mexico.</i>

132
00:10:30,937 --> 00:10:32,371
<i>There's very
little information</i>

133
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:33,505
<i>known about Hellboy</i>

134
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:37,008
<i>or the secretive agency
that apparently he works for.</i>

135
00:10:45,418 --> 00:10:48,587
You missed a spot. May I?

136
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:50,189
Hey, Dad.

137
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,523
My father used to say

138
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,592
shaving was the most important
part of a day.

139
00:10:53,594 --> 00:10:56,962
Separated the gentlemen
from the Philistines.

140
00:10:56,964 --> 00:10:59,064
It takes a real man
to hold a blade

141
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:00,965
against his own throat
every day

142
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:03,435
and not cut the jugular.

143
00:11:03,437 --> 00:11:05,069
Grandpa Bruttenholm,

144
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:07,038
he was all teddy bears
and rainbows.

145
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,441
He was an unrepentant asshole,
but he taught me how to shave.

146
00:11:09,443 --> 00:11:12,278
Like father, like son.

147
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,346
Drowning in tequila
for three weeks

148
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:16,148
may temporarily
numb the pain.

149
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,883
All it ever really does is

150
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:21,122
exacerbate your sorrows
and the state of your liver.

151
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,390
I know you're upset
about Agent Ruiz,

152
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,158
but it's part of the job.

153
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,626
Everyone here knows that.

154
00:11:27,628 --> 00:11:30,996
Job didn't kill him, I did.

155
00:11:30,998 --> 00:11:34,133
And I buried him
16 feet under the earth

156
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:36,235
right by the chapel
of the Virgin Guadalupe,

157
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,469
just to make it proper.

158
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:40,339
He had become unholy,
a vampyre,

159
00:11:40,341 --> 00:11:42,141
a creature of darkness
beyond salvation.

160
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:44,009
A creature of darkness
beyond salvation?

161
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:46,011
You mean, we don't all just
deserve a little

162
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:47,413
gentle horn shave
every now and then?

163
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,981
You're different.
You always have been.

164
00:11:48,983 --> 00:11:54,019
If my face could talk,
it would disagree with you.

165
00:11:54,021 --> 00:11:56,491
I think
it's a beautiful face.

166
00:12:05,534 --> 00:12:07,667
The end is coming.
The end of what?

167
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:10,470
I don't know.
Those were Ruiz's last words.

168
00:12:10,472 --> 00:12:13,472
That and something
about Anung nun...

169
00:12:13,474 --> 00:12:15,007
Does it ring any bells?

170
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:17,344
Nah. Apocalyptic mutterings.

171
00:12:17,346 --> 00:12:22,248
Now there...
Don't you look handsome!

172
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,886
I'm gonna take your word
for that, Pops.

173
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:29,289
Why'd you
bring me back, anyway?

174
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,561
Don't tell me
it's 'cause you miss me.

175
00:12:32,595 --> 00:12:35,961
Do you recall
the Osiris Club?

176
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,930
Oh, yeah.
Strip joint in Jersey.

177
00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:38,864
No, the other one.

178
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:42,068
The British occult society
formed in 1866

179
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,503
by the ranking members

180
00:12:43,505 --> 00:12:45,706
of the Heliopic Brotherhood
of Ra.

181
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,709
Ra? I met Ra once
in the underworld.

182
00:12:48,711 --> 00:12:49,976
He's a close-talker.

183
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,713
You know, like us, they fight
against the forces of darkness

184
00:12:52,715 --> 00:12:56,217
and our organizations have
a long-standing relationship.

185
00:12:56,219 --> 00:12:57,651
They're old friends of mine.

186
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,953
And they've requested
your assistance

187
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:01,354
with a giant problem.

188
00:13:01,356 --> 00:13:04,660
- Oh, yeah? What's that?
- Giants.

189
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,567
Hellboy stole
the life I might've had.

190
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:17,940
Banished me
into an existence of misery.

191
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:23,543
I now only live to kill him.

192
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:27,448
I too have suffered
at Hellboy's hands,

193
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,417
so I know your pain.

194
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:34,021
I felt yours,
so I summoned you here.

195
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:39,593
I will guide you to a witch,
Vivienne Nimue,

196
00:13:39,595 --> 00:13:43,431
cut to pieces
but alive and waiting.

197
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:45,434
Restore her!

198
00:13:45,436 --> 00:13:48,235
She will make you
powerful again

199
00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:50,438
so you can have
your vengeance.

200
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,276
- I thank you.
- This is not going to be easy.

201
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:56,510
Maybe not.

202
00:13:56,512 --> 00:13:59,415
But to be whole again,
I can do it.

203
00:14:02,653 --> 00:14:04,753
Go now.

204
00:14:04,755 --> 00:14:08,790
I don't get it.
What's in it for you?

205
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:14,161
That is no concern
of yours, beast!

206
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:17,632
In the end,
I'll have my way

207
00:14:17,634 --> 00:14:21,971
and Hellboy will pay
what he owes.

208
00:15:03,413 --> 00:15:05,547
Your guest, m'lord.

209
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:08,350
Hellboy, welcome.
Lord Adam Glaren.

210
00:15:08,352 --> 00:15:10,385
And may I introduce
my associates,

211
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:12,555
Dr. Edwin Carp
and August Swain.

212
00:15:12,557 --> 00:15:14,189
Hi.
You guys ever been

213
00:15:14,191 --> 00:15:15,658
to the Osiris Club in Jersey?

214
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,493
It's like this,
but just with strippers.

215
00:15:17,495 --> 00:15:18,530
May I?

216
00:15:19,564 --> 00:15:21,397
Does it do
anything special?

217
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:25,133
Yeah, it smashes things
real good.

218
00:15:25,135 --> 00:15:27,602
We are so very glad
you accepted our invitation.

219
00:15:27,604 --> 00:15:30,372
- Wasn't really my choice.
- Ah.

220
00:15:30,374 --> 00:15:33,141
Yes. The Professor.

221
00:15:33,143 --> 00:15:35,244
Your father and I go back
a long way.

222
00:15:35,246 --> 00:15:37,246
Yeah, I heard.

223
00:15:37,248 --> 00:15:42,151
The Osiris Club has been long
dedicated to preserving

224
00:15:42,153 --> 00:15:44,453
the secret history
of Great Britain.

225
00:15:44,455 --> 00:15:46,657
It affords us
certain insights

226
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:48,858
into individuals such as yourself.

227
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,126
We've also given
vital counsel

228
00:15:51,128 --> 00:15:53,329
to your B.P.R.D.
on occasion.

229
00:15:53,331 --> 00:15:54,864
Look, maybe we could
just get on with it.

230
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:56,699
Unless you flew me
halfway around the world

231
00:15:56,701 --> 00:15:59,602
just so that we could, uh,
have a little history lesson.

232
00:15:59,604 --> 00:16:02,273
Perhaps we should
just show you.

233
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:08,144
Oh.

234
00:16:08,146 --> 00:16:09,646
Secret door.

235
00:16:09,648 --> 00:16:12,181
Giants once dominated
the British Isles.

236
00:16:12,183 --> 00:16:14,450
Vile, loathsome creatures.

237
00:16:14,452 --> 00:16:16,285
As likely to eat you
as look at you.

238
00:16:16,287 --> 00:16:18,154
They've always
been a problem.

239
00:16:18,156 --> 00:16:19,555
Bodies buried
all over England.

240
00:16:19,557 --> 00:16:21,792
It's a curious feature
of giants

241
00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:24,260
that they occasionally rise
from their graves

242
00:16:24,262 --> 00:16:25,394
and wreak havoc.

243
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:28,732
And when they do,
we organize a hunt.

244
00:16:28,734 --> 00:16:32,169
- The wild hunt.
- Oh, catchy.

245
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:35,504
And I thought
I had a big head.

246
00:16:35,506 --> 00:16:39,241
Clearly, you guys
are old pros at this.

247
00:16:39,243 --> 00:16:41,477
Why do you need me
to help you kill a giant?

248
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:42,879
Three giants, actually.

249
00:16:42,881 --> 00:16:45,549
One, we can handle,
perhaps even two.

250
00:16:45,551 --> 00:16:49,186
But three, that's
a different matter altogether.

251
00:16:49,188 --> 00:16:52,756
This particular trio
is terrorizing the New Forest.

252
00:16:52,758 --> 00:16:54,558
Sucking on the bones of anyone

253
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,661
unlucky enough
to fall foul of them.

254
00:16:56,663 --> 00:16:59,663
The marrow, you see.
They can't get enough.

255
00:16:59,665 --> 00:17:02,466
- Hmm.
- So, if any were to reach

256
00:17:02,468 --> 00:17:03,867
a population center...

257
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:06,269
It's Miller time.

258
00:17:06,271 --> 00:17:07,537
This is not a task

259
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:09,840
to be taken lightly, Hellboy.

260
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:13,911
These are Gigantum Mortis.
Very unpleasant.

261
00:17:13,913 --> 00:17:15,581
Just ask your father.

262
00:17:16,783 --> 00:17:18,916
Trevor was a guest
of the hunt,

263
00:17:18,918 --> 00:17:22,920
- when we took one down in '43.
- Uh-huh.

264
00:17:22,922 --> 00:17:27,324
I always knew Dad aged well,
but you guys...

265
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:29,226
Picture looks like
it was taken yesterday.

266
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:30,897
There's a reason for that.

267
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:36,299
The phenomenon
you so rightly observed

268
00:17:36,301 --> 00:17:37,969
was the byproduct of a seance

269
00:17:37,971 --> 00:17:40,571
the four of us, along with
your Professor Broom,

270
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:41,639
were involved in

271
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:43,541
just before the war.

272
00:17:43,543 --> 00:17:46,944
Allow me to introduce
our resident seer,

273
00:17:46,946 --> 00:17:48,946
Lady Elizabeth Hatton.

274
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:51,348
The spirit I made
contact with that night

275
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,484
was exceptionally powerful.

276
00:17:53,486 --> 00:17:55,887
It warned us
that something was coming.

277
00:17:55,889 --> 00:17:58,256
Something
that would end mankind.

278
00:17:58,258 --> 00:18:01,359
And that we'd been chosen
to seek it out and destroy it.

279
00:18:01,361 --> 00:18:03,828
Ever since,
we've aged at a snail's pace

280
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,199
in order to fulfill
that mission

281
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:08,601
no matter how long it took.

282
00:18:09,837 --> 00:18:12,937
Okay. And this thing
you're worried about,

283
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:15,207
did it show up?

284
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:17,711
Oh, yes.

285
00:18:18,378 --> 00:18:19,512
You did.

286
00:18:22,917 --> 00:18:27,420
I was there the night
that you came into the world.

287
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:42,600
<i>World War II
was coming to an end.</i>

288
00:18:42,602 --> 00:18:44,837
<i>Germany was all but defeated.</i>

289
00:18:48,943 --> 00:18:50,476
<i>But the Nazis still had</i>

290
00:18:50,478 --> 00:18:52,311
<i>one last trick
up their sleeve.</i>

291
00:18:52,313 --> 00:18:56,815
<i>They turned to the infamous
necromancer Grigori Rasputin.</i>

292
00:18:56,817 --> 00:18:59,017
<i>On an island
off the coast of Scotland,</i>

293
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:02,320
<i>they gathered to invoke
an ancient occult ritual...</i>

294
00:19:03,858 --> 00:19:06,324
<i>...intended to turn
the tide of war</i>

295
00:19:06,326 --> 00:19:07,893
<i>back in Germany's favor.</i>

296
00:19:16,037 --> 00:19:17,302
<i>But something went wrong.</i>

297
00:19:17,304 --> 00:19:21,975
<i>The ritual didn't turn out
quite as they planned.</i>

298
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:28,914
<i>Fortunately,</i>

299
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,550
<i>legendary Nazi hunter
the Lobster arrived...</i>

300
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:42,898
<i>...leading
the allies on a daring raid.</i>

301
00:19:53,607 --> 00:19:54,608
Goodbye.

302
00:20:11,026 --> 00:20:14,928
Here, so the devil knows
who sent you.

303
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:27,074
As for the rest of you
goose-stepping bastards,

304
00:20:27,076 --> 00:20:28,876
beware of my claw

305
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:31,879
for I have come
to inflict justice

306
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:33,115
on all of you.

307
00:20:39,588 --> 00:20:41,521
<i>Professor Broom and myself</i>

308
00:20:41,523 --> 00:20:43,556
<i>were working with the allies
at the time.</i>

309
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:44,959
<i>With his knowledge
of the occult</i>

310
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:46,559
<i>and my gift of foresight,</i>

311
00:20:46,561 --> 00:20:48,963
<i>we led a secret mission
to the island</i>

312
00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:52,533
<i>to kill whatever abomination
was summoned</i>

313
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:54,501
<i>from the depths of hell
that night.</i>

314
00:20:56,205 --> 00:20:57,440
Hold it!

315
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:00,742
I'll take it from here.

316
00:21:05,714 --> 00:21:08,651
<i>Instead, we found you.</i>

317
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:28,636
Your father
never told you, did he?

318
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:30,671
Why he was really there
that night?

319
00:21:30,673 --> 00:21:32,775
Must've slipped his mind.

320
00:21:35,112 --> 00:21:38,846
Rasputin brought you
in the world as a weapon.

321
00:21:38,848 --> 00:21:41,615
With patience
and understanding,

322
00:21:41,617 --> 00:21:43,885
Broom turned that weapon
into a force for good.

323
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,820
"Patience and understanding."

324
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:47,788
You sure we're talking
about the same guy?

325
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:51,125
He saw something in you
that the rest of us could not.

326
00:21:51,127 --> 00:21:54,062
And he raised you
as his own son.

327
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:56,131
You should get some rest,
Hellboy.

328
00:21:56,133 --> 00:21:58,634
The hunt will assemble
at dawn.

329
00:22:02,673 --> 00:22:04,940
So I'm devil spawn
and a Nazi.

330
00:22:04,942 --> 00:22:07,175
Great. Thanks, Dad.

331
00:22:13,951 --> 00:22:15,484
Oh, come on!

332
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,653
Where is it, monk?

333
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:28,991
Come here, you fucking
bastards!

334
00:23:33,765 --> 00:23:36,234
Come here! Have you got it?

335
00:23:41,739 --> 00:23:44,207
I wonder, does screaming

336
00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:46,674
break your
vow of silence, brother?

337
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:51,182
You know what I'm looking for.
Where is it?

338
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,557
Show me!

339
00:24:04,396 --> 00:24:06,231
Come on!

340
00:24:28,787 --> 00:24:30,354
Come here, monk!

341
00:24:41,867 --> 00:24:44,801
I fuckin' hate iron!

342
00:24:44,803 --> 00:24:47,938
Open it.
Speak the words.

343
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,906
You know only the words

344
00:24:49,908 --> 00:24:51,875
from a man of God
can break the seal.

345
00:24:51,877 --> 00:24:54,878
Fucking open it!

346
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,685
Have I gotta do
everything meself?

347
00:25:00,819 --> 00:25:02,821
Gobshite.

348
00:25:27,846 --> 00:25:30,183
Welcome back, Your Majesty.

349
00:25:32,886 --> 00:25:35,920
What, are we trick-or-treating
or hunting giants?

350
00:25:35,922 --> 00:25:39,924
Tradition. To honor the brave
huntsmen who've come before.

351
00:25:39,926 --> 00:25:41,192
And the pig stickers?

352
00:25:41,194 --> 00:25:42,394
Another tradition.

353
00:25:42,396 --> 00:25:46,298
Used by giant slayers
throughout the ages.

354
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,466
With a few modern
modifications, of course.

355
00:25:48,468 --> 00:25:50,301
Five times as potent

356
00:25:50,303 --> 00:25:52,737
- as an electric chair.
- Mmm.

357
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:55,373
Not enough to kill a giant,
mind you. But, uh, still,

358
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:58,342
quite handy in subduing the creatures.
Would you care for one?

359
00:25:58,344 --> 00:26:01,913
Oh, it's all right,
I got traditions of my own.

360
00:26:01,915 --> 00:26:05,050
Oh, God. I don't have to
wear the hat, do I?

361
00:26:05,052 --> 00:26:07,818
No.
We're very well aware

362
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,221
of your distaste for horns.

363
00:26:09,223 --> 00:26:12,056
It's my honor,
as master of the hunt,

364
00:26:12,058 --> 00:26:13,291
to wear the headdress.

365
00:26:13,293 --> 00:26:15,393
Mmm.

366
00:26:15,395 --> 00:26:17,762
And here we are.
Long Shadow.

367
00:26:17,764 --> 00:26:20,499
Don't you have a jeep
or a motorcycle or something?

368
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:22,401
That wouldn't be
very sporting now, would it?

369
00:26:22,403 --> 00:26:24,238
He'll bring you home safely.

370
00:26:26,773 --> 00:26:30,842
For the record,
this wasn't my idea.

371
00:26:58,805 --> 00:27:01,976
Three sets of tracks.
Just as Lady Hatton foretold.

372
00:27:04,812 --> 00:27:07,212
I count four bodies.
Parts of them, anyway.

373
00:27:07,214 --> 00:27:09,449
- They'll be back.
- What makes you so sure?

374
00:27:09,451 --> 00:27:11,917
Giants don't leave
food behind.

375
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,289
The tracks are heading north,
toward the river.

376
00:27:25,899 --> 00:27:28,000
This is where
we'll make our stand.

377
00:27:28,002 --> 00:27:29,302
They'll use the bridge
to cross.

378
00:27:29,304 --> 00:27:32,971
We can take up positions
in the brush on either side.

379
00:27:32,973 --> 00:27:35,543
Yeah, seems like a perfect
spot for an ambush.

380
00:27:36,444 --> 00:27:38,013
My thoughts exactly.

381
00:27:48,922 --> 00:27:50,256
- Let's get him!
- Take him!

382
00:27:58,266 --> 00:27:59,267
After him!

383
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:13,114
Bring him down!

384
00:28:34,502 --> 00:28:37,671
Did you really think
we needed your help

385
00:28:37,673 --> 00:28:42,075
to kill something we've been
hunting for centuries?

386
00:28:52,388 --> 00:28:54,121
We will never allow the devil

387
00:28:54,123 --> 00:28:57,224
to sit on the throne
of England.

388
00:28:57,226 --> 00:28:59,493
It would usher
in the apocalypse.

389
00:29:02,931 --> 00:29:05,065
I must confess

390
00:29:05,067 --> 00:29:06,633
when Lady Hatton
first told me

391
00:29:06,635 --> 00:29:09,136
about her vision
and what needed to be done

392
00:29:09,138 --> 00:29:10,037
I was hesitant.

393
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:14,074
Broom was so certain
of your potential

394
00:29:14,076 --> 00:29:17,980
and you have done
so much good.

395
00:29:27,123 --> 00:29:29,425
But fate is a fickle beast.

396
00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:34,596
And now I must do

397
00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:37,267
what your father should have
done those many years ago.

398
00:29:38,468 --> 00:29:39,401
No.

399
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:42,036
If it's any consolation,
your head will make

400
00:29:42,038 --> 00:29:44,305
a wonderful addition
to our gallery.

401
00:30:09,467 --> 00:30:14,001
- <i>Oh, Jill!</i>
- <i>You are going down!</i>

402
00:30:14,003 --> 00:30:16,139
<i>Oh, I thought it was
the same toe.</i>

403
00:30:25,483 --> 00:30:30,252
You have no idea
how many I had to kill.

404
00:30:30,254 --> 00:30:32,455
I'll have you playing <i>Twister</i>
in no time.

405
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:34,156
Sorry, too soon.

406
00:30:34,158 --> 00:30:37,225
And soon you shall reap
the reward for your efforts.

407
00:30:37,227 --> 00:30:41,029
I didn't know if you'd be
hungry or what, you know.

408
00:30:41,031 --> 00:30:44,265
A thousand years in a box
and I'd be starving.

409
00:30:44,267 --> 00:30:45,534
You wouldn't believe
what people

410
00:30:45,536 --> 00:30:48,237
throw away
these days. Cookie!

411
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:52,109
Revenge is the only sustenance
I require.

412
00:30:52,677 --> 00:30:54,477
Look at this.

413
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:58,446
A world ravaged by war
and poverty

414
00:30:58,448 --> 00:31:03,719
led by feckless fear mongers.
They've replaced swords with

415
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:06,087
singing competitions.

416
00:31:06,089 --> 00:31:07,090
Yeah.

417
00:31:09,193 --> 00:31:12,261
Well,
not for much longer.

418
00:31:12,263 --> 00:31:15,064
What about my other hand?

419
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:16,566
You're certain
you can retrieve it?

420
00:31:16,568 --> 00:31:18,067
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

421
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:21,136
And you'll restore me,
as you promised?

422
00:31:21,138 --> 00:31:23,205
Don't worry,
you'll get what's due.

423
00:31:23,207 --> 00:31:26,542
All good things
come to those who wait.

424
00:31:26,544 --> 00:31:30,515
Bring me the last box.
Make me whole again.

425
00:31:31,215 --> 00:31:32,816
And together,

426
00:31:32,818 --> 00:31:36,452
<i>we will baptize this world
in blood.</i>

427
00:32:00,111 --> 00:32:02,812
That hurt. Okay.

428
00:32:04,683 --> 00:32:06,149
Huh?

429
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:15,458
Well, look at that.

430
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,829
I guess you did need my help
after all.

431
00:32:18,764 --> 00:32:20,365
Wait a minute.

432
00:32:22,301 --> 00:32:24,668
I thought there was
supposed to be three.

433
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:28,575
Whoa!

434
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:35,547
Whoa! Whoa!

435
00:33:09,882 --> 00:33:12,151
God, I'm gonna feel that
in the morning.

436
00:33:24,329 --> 00:33:26,131
Come to papa.

437
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:28,835
Hold still, handsome!

438
00:33:34,607 --> 00:33:36,777
It's fucking wet in there!

439
00:33:49,522 --> 00:33:50,857
Hey, pal!

440
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,762
Ugh!

441
00:33:56,396 --> 00:33:57,865
What have you been eating?

442
00:34:00,634 --> 00:34:02,836
Oh, shit, I forgot.

443
00:34:17,885 --> 00:34:20,286
Yeah, it's just you
and me now, princess!

444
00:35:12,841 --> 00:35:14,676
Is that my Uber?

445
00:35:21,883 --> 00:35:24,349
There he is.

446
00:35:24,351 --> 00:35:26,453
- That's him.
- Let's get him.

447
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:49,444
Welcome back
to the land of the living.

448
00:35:51,646 --> 00:35:54,680
Hardly a scratch left.
You heal fast.

449
00:35:54,682 --> 00:35:55,581
Where am I?

450
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:57,350
Bacon, eggs
and black pudding, do ya?

451
00:35:57,352 --> 00:36:01,056
You look like you could use
a proper English breakfast.

452
00:36:02,591 --> 00:36:05,592
Go on, sit down
before you fall down.

453
00:36:05,594 --> 00:36:06,727
How did I get here?

454
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:08,462
A man with a van.

455
00:36:08,464 --> 00:36:10,530
Actually, four men.

456
00:36:10,532 --> 00:36:12,534
You owe me 300 quid,
by the way.

457
00:36:13,468 --> 00:36:15,370
I'm sorry,
do I know you?

458
00:36:16,806 --> 00:36:19,507
"Beware the Jabberwock,
my son!

459
00:36:20,609 --> 00:36:26,146
"The jaws that bite,
the claws that catch!

460
00:36:26,148 --> 00:36:29,383
- "Beware..."
- "...the Jubjub bird..."

461
00:36:29,385 --> 00:36:32,386
- "...and shun the frumious...
- "...the frumious..."

462
00:36:32,388 --> 00:36:33,822
"...Bandersnatch!"

463
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:38,093
Alice.

464
00:36:39,862 --> 00:36:42,496
Little Alice Monaghan.

465
00:36:42,498 --> 00:36:44,798
Not so little Alice Monaghan.

466
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:50,939
This is what you do now, huh?
You what, you read tea leaves?

467
00:36:50,941 --> 00:36:54,676
You, uh,
you tell people's fortune?

468
00:36:54,678 --> 00:36:56,410
I make use of the gifts
I was given.

469
00:36:56,412 --> 00:37:00,047
Oh, yeah? You let folks
talk to their dead relatives?

470
00:37:00,049 --> 00:37:02,683
For what,
like five bucks a pop?

471
00:37:02,685 --> 00:37:04,618
More like a tenner.

472
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,620
Missed one.

473
00:37:06,622 --> 00:37:08,992
Bollocks!

474
00:37:16,766 --> 00:37:18,967
You'll have to eat
around the burnt bits.

475
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:20,969
And lucky for you, too.

476
00:37:20,971 --> 00:37:23,937
If it weren't for the dead,
I never would've found you.

477
00:37:23,939 --> 00:37:27,208
They keep blathering on.
Especially Mom and Dad.

478
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,444
Oh.

479
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:30,546
They say hi, by the way.

480
00:37:33,783 --> 00:37:35,783
Sorry. I didn't know.

481
00:37:35,785 --> 00:37:36,885
Why would you?

482
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:39,520
Maybe if you'd given a flying
fig and checked in on me

483
00:37:39,522 --> 00:37:41,823
once in the past 20...

484
00:37:41,825 --> 00:37:46,493
What? No, he doesn't.
Just let me deal with it.

485
00:37:46,495 --> 00:37:48,462
More dead people?

486
00:37:48,464 --> 00:37:50,732
I told you,
they never shut up.

487
00:37:50,734 --> 00:37:52,636
What are they
telling you now?

488
00:37:54,504 --> 00:37:56,973
They're saying I should kill
you while I have the chance.

489
00:37:58,074 --> 00:38:00,942
You see, they know
what you don't,

490
00:38:00,944 --> 00:38:02,810
that I've got a shotgun
under the table

491
00:38:02,812 --> 00:38:04,046
loaded with angel bones

492
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:07,685
aimed right at your todger.

493
00:38:10,086 --> 00:38:13,054
Seems like everybody
wants me dead nowadays.

494
00:38:13,056 --> 00:38:15,025
They give you a reason?

495
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:18,927
Only that the end is coming.

496
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,198
And it'll be you
that brings it.

497
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,171
Google-translate that,
would you?

498
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:31,509
It's just something that

499
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,976
a friend told me,
you know.

500
00:38:34,978 --> 00:38:36,680
Like a prophecy.

501
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:43,688
You gonna shoot me or what?

502
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:03,172
The dead might be afraid
of your demon ass,

503
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,740
but I know you better.

504
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,309
Besides, I still owe you one

505
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:08,010
for saving my life
when I was just a kid.

506
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,745
So, what are we doing
down here?

507
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:10,913
Avoiding the glass.

508
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:15,153
- Armed police!
- Stay here!

509
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,658
Jesus Christ!

510
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,762
That's my boy.

511
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:28,964
Dad!

512
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,668
Hello, son.

513
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,003
<i>I just don't know why</i>

514
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:35,604
- you were so angry with me.
- You couldn't have knocked?

515
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,207
Well, I told you,
after we cleaned up

516
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:39,009
the mess you left behind
with the giants

517
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:40,176
and you weren't there,

518
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:42,612
I feared the worst. Thank God
you're all right. Okay?

519
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:44,881
You know what hurts worse than
being stabbed in the back?

520
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,282
Being stabbed in the back.

521
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:48,218
Oh, come on.
You can't possibly believe

522
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,651
that I knew the Osiris Club

523
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:51,154
was plotting
to assassinate you.

524
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:52,654
You know what
I can't believe?

525
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,891
I can't believe
you showed up on Nazi island

526
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:57,260
all those years ago
just to kill me.

527
00:39:57,262 --> 00:39:58,795
Yeah, that's right,

528
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:00,597
I bumped into your old flame,
Lady Hatton.

529
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,665
She, uh, filled me in
on a couple of

530
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:05,668
the missing pieces
of our family narrative.

531
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,671
Well, if you wanna dig up
my sordid skeletons,

532
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:11,174
I'll be the first
to hand you a shovel.

533
00:40:11,176 --> 00:40:13,176
But this is not the time,
and there's someone

534
00:40:13,178 --> 00:40:15,011
I wanna introduce
you to, okay?

535
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:19,716
Major Ben Daimio,
head of Special Ops for M-11.

536
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:21,787
- M-11?
- My son.

537
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:25,022
I thought you guys disbanded
after the war.

538
00:40:25,024 --> 00:40:26,223
And I thought
we were supposed to be

539
00:40:26,225 --> 00:40:27,992
fighting monsters,
not working with them.

540
00:40:27,994 --> 00:40:29,193
Who you calling monster, pal?

541
00:40:29,195 --> 00:40:30,828
You look in the mirror
recently, Scarface?

542
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,163
- Is that meant to be humor?
- Maybe.

543
00:40:32,165 --> 00:40:34,864
My therapist does say
that I rely on jokes

544
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:35,765
as a way to normalize.

545
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:38,804
Normalize, right.
Good luck with that.

546
00:40:40,339 --> 00:40:42,907
So glad to see you two
are getting along.

547
00:40:42,909 --> 00:40:45,810
Since this is on British soil,
it'll be a joint operation.

548
00:40:45,812 --> 00:40:48,045
Please, I don't need any help
kicking the dentures out of

549
00:40:48,047 --> 00:40:49,280
the Osiris Club, all right?
I got this.

550
00:40:49,282 --> 00:40:50,748
No, this is bigger
than you know.

551
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,050
St. Sebastian's
has been attacked

552
00:40:53,052 --> 00:40:54,251
and a relic was stolen.

553
00:40:54,253 --> 00:40:56,188
Thought to be one
of the Nimue Caskets.

554
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,255
Nim-who?

555
00:40:57,257 --> 00:40:59,156
Vivienne Nimue.

556
00:40:59,158 --> 00:41:01,325
Also known as the Blood Queen.

557
00:41:01,327 --> 00:41:03,727
An immortal
fifth century sorceress.

558
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:05,262
Amongst her powers,
she has a plague

559
00:41:05,264 --> 00:41:06,897
that almost wiped Britain
off the map.

560
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:08,732
And this time
it could be the world.

561
00:41:08,734 --> 00:41:11,035
King Arthur himself
took care of that monster.

562
00:41:11,037 --> 00:41:12,870
He used Excalibur
to dismember her,

563
00:41:12,872 --> 00:41:14,905
then locked the pieces
in caskets

564
00:41:14,907 --> 00:41:16,141
and hid them
throughout the country.

565
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:17,842
Very impressive, Major.

566
00:41:17,844 --> 00:41:19,810
The Osiris Club discovered one
in the '30s

567
00:41:19,812 --> 00:41:22,947
and kept it as part
of their permanent collection.

568
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:24,715
Great. So we go back
to the Osiris Club,

569
00:41:24,717 --> 00:41:25,783
we find this casket,

570
00:41:25,785 --> 00:41:27,952
we figure out whoever's
trying to Humpty Dumpty

571
00:41:27,954 --> 00:41:29,354
this Blood Queen back together

572
00:41:29,356 --> 00:41:31,122
and we get a little payback
while we're at it.

573
00:41:31,124 --> 00:41:33,891
Payback?
This isn't about revenge.

574
00:41:33,893 --> 00:41:35,826
For me, it is.

575
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:37,129
Once the casket is secure,

576
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:39,264
you'll be
on the first flight out.

577
00:41:39,266 --> 00:41:42,067
The Bureau can put you back
in your cage.

578
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:44,970
My cage?
My cage!

579
00:41:44,972 --> 00:41:48,072
I'm gonna ask specifically
that you clean my sawdust.

580
00:41:48,074 --> 00:41:51,075
Can't wait till you smell
demon shit, pal!

581
00:41:51,077 --> 00:41:52,978
They tell me
you're the man in charge.

582
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,780
- What's this?
- A bill for damages.

583
00:41:57,484 --> 00:42:00,752
A million pounds?
For a few broken windows?

584
00:42:00,754 --> 00:42:02,220
You've gotta factor
in the emotional trauma.

585
00:42:02,222 --> 00:42:04,022
I'm sorry,
who are you again?

586
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:06,091
I'm the girl who saved
Hellboy. Who the hell are you?

587
00:42:06,093 --> 00:42:07,959
Yeah, I wanted to thank you
for that, by the way.

588
00:42:07,961 --> 00:42:10,462
So, she's what,
your bodyguard?

589
00:42:10,464 --> 00:42:12,964
Fucking right I am.
So let's go.

590
00:42:12,966 --> 00:42:16,868
This is a military operation!
Not a carnival sideshow.

591
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:20,240
Alice is the only person
that I trust, all right?

592
00:42:21,942 --> 00:42:24,312
So, you want me,

593
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:26,414
she comes with.

594
00:42:27,814 --> 00:42:31,085
Here, your new toy.

595
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,786
Do what you have to do.

596
00:42:34,788 --> 00:42:36,188
I'm going back to HQ

597
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,956
and try to locate
the rest of the Blood Queen.

598
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:39,024
Good luck, hmm?

599
00:42:39,026 --> 00:42:41,993
Professor.
What about the girl?

600
00:42:41,995 --> 00:42:44,397
Alice? She's a powerful
spirit medium.

601
00:42:44,399 --> 00:42:46,434
Take her with you. We need
all the help we can get.

602
00:42:49,938 --> 00:42:52,140
All right, we're done here!
Let's move it out!

603
00:43:11,259 --> 00:43:13,027
Well, aren't you
gonna open it?

604
00:43:14,095 --> 00:43:15,163
Hmm?

605
00:43:19,435 --> 00:43:21,000
That's mega.

606
00:43:21,002 --> 00:43:22,201
He's probably
overcompensating

607
00:43:22,203 --> 00:43:23,271
'cause he's not my real dad.

608
00:43:25,173 --> 00:43:26,207
That's some present.

609
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:30,011
Some dads get
their kids LEGOs.

610
00:43:40,155 --> 00:43:41,257
What's wrong?

611
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:45,325
- What's wrong?
- Psychic migraine.

612
00:43:45,327 --> 00:43:47,560
It's like a car crash
in my head.

613
00:43:47,562 --> 00:43:49,962
Something terrible
happened here.

614
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,535
Stay here. Don't move.

615
00:44:04,546 --> 00:44:05,948
Oh, God.

616
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:10,852
- Hold. Move on my command.
- What?

617
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,186
Can we go in now?

618
00:44:13,188 --> 00:44:16,189
For fuck's sake, help him!
Can't you hear him screaming?

619
00:44:16,191 --> 00:44:17,326
Alice.

620
00:45:09,479 --> 00:45:11,181
What is that sound?

621
00:45:23,526 --> 00:45:25,326
It's Lady Hatton.

622
00:45:25,328 --> 00:45:27,528
The psychic
you were telling us about?

623
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:29,966
Clearly, she wasn't
psychic enough.

624
00:45:30,934 --> 00:45:34,404
Alice, picking up anything?

625
00:45:36,005 --> 00:45:37,405
Her spirit's still with us.

626
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,107
You think
you can make contact?

627
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:41,044
Figure out what the hell
happened here?

628
00:45:44,013 --> 00:45:46,447
You might wanna leave, Major.

629
00:45:46,449 --> 00:45:49,117
This kind of thing
isn't pretty.

630
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,921
And miss all the fun?
Not a chance.

631
00:46:01,499 --> 00:46:04,969
Lady Hatton,
can you hear me?

632
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:10,204
Lady Hatton...

633
00:46:21,318 --> 00:46:23,118
Well, I'll be fucked.

634
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,555
Nimue, she has returned.

635
00:46:26,557 --> 00:46:28,591
Yeah, we know that.

636
00:46:28,593 --> 00:46:32,629
Uh, is that why
Osiris tried to kill me?

637
00:46:32,631 --> 00:46:35,062
Man will fall
to her darkness.

638
00:46:35,064 --> 00:46:37,201
Those who call
the shadows home

639
00:46:37,635 --> 00:46:39,601
will rise again.

640
00:46:39,603 --> 00:46:41,036
Okay.

641
00:46:41,038 --> 00:46:44,072
I'd appreciate a prophecy with
smaller and more relatable stakes.

642
00:46:44,074 --> 00:46:48,478
The Queen must
never find a king!

643
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,246
When Nimue is whole again,

644
00:46:51,248 --> 00:46:56,219
then your true destiny
will be revealed.

645
00:46:56,221 --> 00:47:01,089
This I have seen.
Only then will...

646
00:47:01,091 --> 00:47:05,160
Only then will what?
Hey, hey! Hey!

647
00:47:05,162 --> 00:47:07,630
You're just getting
to the good part!

648
00:47:07,632 --> 00:47:09,466
It's still here!

649
00:47:17,476 --> 00:47:19,108
- Are you all right?
- No.

650
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:21,543
A lady just came out of
my fucking mouth!

651
00:47:24,114 --> 00:47:25,648
Stay with her.

652
00:47:30,422 --> 00:47:31,521
Oh, fuck!

653
00:47:31,523 --> 00:47:32,589
I know you.

654
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,461
Is that an arm?

655
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:40,530
Fucking let me go!

656
00:47:40,532 --> 00:47:42,298
Oh, that's disgusting!

657
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,434
Didn't your mother
ever tell you

658
00:47:43,436 --> 00:47:45,200
you shouldn't play
with dead things!

659
00:47:45,202 --> 00:47:48,238
My Queen, help me!
I'm not ready yet!

660
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,706
My Queen!

661
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:53,743
Fascinating.

662
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:56,782
Never have I seen a creature
quite like you.

663
00:47:59,384 --> 00:48:01,150
Nimue.

664
00:48:01,152 --> 00:48:05,224
Such power,
such glorious potential.

665
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,592
There is no reason for us
to be enemies,

666
00:48:09,594 --> 00:48:10,795
when we can be

667
00:48:11,563 --> 00:48:13,429
so much more.

668
00:48:13,431 --> 00:48:16,667
They fear us.
They call us monsters.

669
00:48:16,669 --> 00:48:20,871
We yearn for the same day,
when we are not reviled but

670
00:48:20,873 --> 00:48:22,808
lauded as heroes.

671
00:48:24,844 --> 00:48:26,746
Seed by seed,

672
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:31,417
tree by tree,
stone by stone,

673
00:48:32,485 --> 00:48:34,654
we'll replant Eden together.

674
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:37,657
What happens next,

675
00:48:38,658 --> 00:48:40,493
only the fates decide.

676
00:48:41,761 --> 00:48:43,062
Hellboy!

677
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:53,471
You fucking prick!

678
00:48:53,473 --> 00:48:55,409
I missed, didn't I?

679
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,223
Hey! Tell me
you got the bastard.

680
00:49:13,225 --> 00:49:16,227
We pursued. The damn thing
was just too fast.

681
00:49:16,229 --> 00:49:18,630
We didn't even get
a proper look at it.

682
00:49:18,632 --> 00:49:20,865
That ugly pig-faced
son of a bitch.

683
00:49:20,867 --> 00:49:23,233
But you did,
didn't you?

684
00:49:23,235 --> 00:49:24,668
You know what's going on here,

685
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,306
so I strongly suggest
you start talking.

686
00:49:30,944 --> 00:49:32,579
It was the Gruagach.

687
00:49:34,314 --> 00:49:36,247
- The what?
- Are you sure?

688
00:49:36,249 --> 00:49:38,717
Yeah. I'd never forget
a face like that.

689
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:40,485
What's a Gruagach?

690
00:49:40,487 --> 00:49:42,955
We first
crossed paths years ago.

691
00:49:42,957 --> 00:49:45,857
<i>Alice was just
a baby at the time,</i>

692
00:49:45,859 --> 00:49:48,727
<i>and fairies loved
to steal babies.</i>

693
00:49:48,729 --> 00:49:49,828
It's like living
in a nightmare

694
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:51,663
we can't wake up from.

695
00:49:51,665 --> 00:49:54,332
<i>Who knows why, but when they
do manage to get their hands on one,</i>

696
00:49:54,334 --> 00:49:58,203
<i>they leave a changeling in
its place to pass for human.</i>

697
00:49:58,205 --> 00:49:59,907
She looks the same, but...

698
00:50:00,607 --> 00:50:02,407
I can't explain it.

699
00:50:02,409 --> 00:50:04,912
That's not my daughter.

700
00:50:05,947 --> 00:50:09,213
Oh, look at you.

701
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:12,384
Alice, aren't you
the cutest little baby?

702
00:50:15,656 --> 00:50:18,724
Your mom
and your dad are, uh,

703
00:50:18,726 --> 00:50:20,728
well, worried that you've
been acting strange.

704
00:50:21,763 --> 00:50:24,563
It's okay.
Uncle Hellboy is here.

705
00:50:24,565 --> 00:50:27,402
And he's got just the thing

706
00:50:28,269 --> 00:50:29,404
for that.

707
00:50:37,611 --> 00:50:40,946
Yeah, that's what I thought,
you little bastard!

708
00:50:40,948 --> 00:50:42,648
Ah, Jesus!
What are you doing?

709
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:45,551
Iron. They hate the stuff.

710
00:50:48,956 --> 00:50:50,322
Let me go!

711
00:50:50,324 --> 00:50:52,625
Let me go! Ahh!
This is child abuse!

712
00:50:52,627 --> 00:50:54,360
I'm a little baby,
you big fuck!

713
00:50:55,698 --> 00:50:58,363
- It's disgusting!
- What is that thing?

714
00:50:58,365 --> 00:50:59,366
Didn't get!

715
00:51:02,704 --> 00:51:04,336
Fuck off!

716
00:51:05,807 --> 00:51:08,874
It hurts! It hurts!
I promise! I promise!

717
00:51:08,876 --> 00:51:10,409
The fairies
will return her!

718
00:51:10,411 --> 00:51:11,812
I swear!
Just fucking let me go!

719
00:51:11,814 --> 00:51:13,914
Yeah, I'd love to
take your word for it.

720
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:15,347
But you know what?

721
00:51:15,349 --> 00:51:17,718
There's one problem,
I'm just not stupid!

722
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:20,986
Twat!

723
00:51:20,988 --> 00:51:23,656
You slippery little bastard!

724
00:51:23,658 --> 00:51:25,891
Listen!

725
00:51:25,893 --> 00:51:29,528
You better bring these people
back their baby

726
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:32,666
or I'm coming
to get her myself!

727
00:51:32,668 --> 00:51:35,902
And then you
and your fairy friends

728
00:51:35,904 --> 00:51:38,739
are gonna be sorry!

729
00:51:49,484 --> 00:51:51,319
About goddamn time.

730
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:54,957
Alice!

731
00:51:58,894 --> 00:52:01,062
Oh, my God. She's back.

732
00:52:01,064 --> 00:52:02,562
This better be
a clean diaper,

733
00:52:02,564 --> 00:52:03,965
or I'm coming after you!

734
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,066
Oh, wee Alice.

735
00:52:05,068 --> 00:52:07,034
<i>Guess I couldn't
avoid him forever.</i>

736
00:52:07,036 --> 00:52:08,569
<i>Destiny always has a way</i>

737
00:52:08,571 --> 00:52:09,936
<i>of bringing things
full circle.</i>

738
00:52:09,938 --> 00:52:11,705
<i>Destiny.</i>

739
00:52:11,707 --> 00:52:14,407
Stupid word
for "coincidence."

740
00:52:14,409 --> 00:52:17,677
Don't talk shit about fate.
She's a vindictive bitch.

741
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:20,747
We carry every sin committed
in our bloodlines.

742
00:52:20,749 --> 00:52:23,785
Blood Queen said
pretty much the same thing.

743
00:52:23,787 --> 00:52:25,720
So, that's what
this is all about?

744
00:52:25,722 --> 00:52:27,420
Some fairy tale wanker
you pissed off

745
00:52:27,422 --> 00:52:28,723
is now looking for revenge?

746
00:52:28,725 --> 00:52:30,758
And he's now using
the Blood Queen to get it.

747
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,460
I don't know about that.
Maybe she's using him.

748
00:52:33,462 --> 00:52:34,561
And how's that?

749
00:52:34,563 --> 00:52:35,729
This Arthur comes along,

750
00:52:35,731 --> 00:52:37,464
chops her up
into little pieces,

751
00:52:37,466 --> 00:52:38,799
buries her in boxes?

752
00:52:38,801 --> 00:52:40,835
Maybe she just wants
monsters to come out

753
00:52:40,837 --> 00:52:42,569
from the shadows
and live again.

754
00:52:42,571 --> 00:52:45,973
Great, so she gets another
shot at wiping out mankind.

755
00:52:45,975 --> 00:52:47,443
Hey, hey, hey.

756
00:52:48,745 --> 00:52:52,446
We don't know that about her.
Not for sure.

757
00:52:52,448 --> 00:52:55,351
Collect our men. I'm taking
them back to London HQ.

758
00:53:01,456 --> 00:53:06,928
O night, faithful
preserver of mysteries.

759
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:16,437
And ye bright
stars and moon.

760
00:53:16,439 --> 00:53:20,042
Succeed the fires
of hateful day.

761
00:53:23,813 --> 00:53:25,813
Careful, you slags!

762
00:53:25,815 --> 00:53:27,849
The pain is fleeting

763
00:53:27,851 --> 00:53:31,752
compared to 1,500 years
locked in a box.

764
00:53:31,754 --> 00:53:34,990
I only live to serve,
my Queen.

765
00:53:34,992 --> 00:53:38,060
You only serve
to get your revenge

766
00:53:38,062 --> 00:53:40,195
against this Hellboy.

767
00:53:43,467 --> 00:53:45,833
Why is he
so important to you?

768
00:53:45,835 --> 00:53:48,170
He burnt me with iron

769
00:53:48,172 --> 00:53:50,671
and cursed me
to a world of shame.

770
00:53:50,673 --> 00:53:53,474
I could've been a person.

771
00:53:53,476 --> 00:53:56,513
Not this wasted,
wandering thing.

772
00:53:58,182 --> 00:53:59,815
I could've had a real life,

773
00:53:59,817 --> 00:54:03,118
filled with light
and happiness.

774
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,721
Hellboy stole that from me.

775
00:54:05,723 --> 00:54:07,223
Poor creature.

776
00:54:07,225 --> 00:54:11,459
Lust for vengeance has
made us both blind with rage.

777
00:54:11,461 --> 00:54:14,162
Nimue, Queen of Witches.

778
00:54:14,164 --> 00:54:15,831
Nimue who lives.

779
00:54:18,502 --> 00:54:22,539
Nimue, who can never die.

780
00:54:30,715 --> 00:54:31,950
But now,

781
00:54:33,017 --> 00:54:36,585
I see a new path
laid out before me,

782
00:54:36,587 --> 00:54:39,554
one that would lead
to far greater glory.

783
00:54:39,556 --> 00:54:42,691
- And your Hellboy is the key.
- Hellboy? But...

784
00:54:42,693 --> 00:54:45,862
Where are we going with this?
I don't... I don't understand.

785
00:54:45,864 --> 00:54:48,199
You will.

786
00:54:49,134 --> 00:54:51,567
But first,

787
00:54:51,569 --> 00:54:55,206
we must complete
one final task.

788
00:55:11,156 --> 00:55:13,290
- Fish 'n chips shop?
- We're here.

789
00:55:13,292 --> 00:55:15,225
This is it?

790
00:55:15,227 --> 00:55:17,962
Were you expecting a sign that
says "Secret Headquarters"?

791
00:55:19,031 --> 00:55:20,032
Come on.

792
00:55:20,764 --> 00:55:21,898
Mrs. Harker.

793
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:22,999
Hello.

794
00:55:23,001 --> 00:55:25,969
Whoa, I thought it smelled
bad on the outside.

795
00:55:25,971 --> 00:55:28,037
I'll let you two take it
from here. I'm leaving.

796
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:29,906
And you,
don't go anywhere.

797
00:55:29,908 --> 00:55:31,140
Last thing I need
is some freak

798
00:55:31,142 --> 00:55:34,211
wandering around
scaring the locals.

799
00:55:34,213 --> 00:55:36,280
Where's he going?

800
00:55:36,282 --> 00:55:38,148
Haven't we got to be
saving the world or something?

801
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:39,950
Uh...
He's an asshole.

802
00:55:39,952 --> 00:55:40,953
Oi.

803
00:55:41,954 --> 00:55:43,721
I need some ID, love.

804
00:55:43,723 --> 00:55:45,088
Are you serious?

805
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:47,092
Rules are rules,
I'm afraid.

806
00:55:54,166 --> 00:55:58,068
Whoa. Mmm. Now I've been
to purgatory and hell.

807
00:55:58,070 --> 00:55:59,870
It was
an old bomb shelter

808
00:55:59,872 --> 00:56:01,672
that was refurbished
after the war.

809
00:56:01,674 --> 00:56:04,076
Refurbished?
You call this refurbished?

810
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:06,610
Oh, good, you're here!

811
00:56:06,612 --> 00:56:09,647
This is all we got
on Nimue so far.

812
00:56:12,051 --> 00:56:15,119
We're fine.
Thank you for asking.

813
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:17,187
Your friends at Osiris,
not so much.

814
00:56:17,189 --> 00:56:18,922
No two stories
are alike,

815
00:56:18,924 --> 00:56:20,357
but everything
seems to suggest

816
00:56:20,359 --> 00:56:22,259
she won't get her full powers

817
00:56:22,261 --> 00:56:24,128
until she's
completely restored.

818
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:28,665
Hey, hey, did you hear me?
All your friends are dead!

819
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:30,068
And there'll be
a lot more dead

820
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:31,668
if we don't find her.

821
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:33,603
So perhaps you two
would like to grab a book,

822
00:56:33,605 --> 00:56:34,671
do some research,

823
00:56:34,673 --> 00:56:36,073
maybe find out where she is,

824
00:56:36,075 --> 00:56:38,976
so we can bury her
before she buries us.

825
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:41,979
Great. Homework.

826
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,681
No wonder Daimio took off.

827
00:56:54,795 --> 00:56:57,928
<i>Agent Daimio, M-11.
Is the package ready?</i>

828
00:56:57,930 --> 00:56:59,364
<i>Sir, almost.</i>

829
00:56:59,366 --> 00:57:01,031
You're sure
this is going to work?

830
00:57:01,033 --> 00:57:02,766
A lot of people have
tried to kill him already.

831
00:57:02,768 --> 00:57:04,735
Not with something
like this they didn't.

832
00:57:04,737 --> 00:57:06,837
It's cast from Judas Silver

833
00:57:06,839 --> 00:57:09,207
mixed with the blood
of Saint Dominic,

834
00:57:09,209 --> 00:57:11,342
blessed by
the Holy Father himself.

835
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,046
It will work,
I assure you.

836
00:57:14,714 --> 00:57:16,281
Assuming you've actually
got to use it.

837
00:57:16,283 --> 00:57:19,117
I mean, who's to say
this bloke's not on the level?

838
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:22,320
Do you know what I did
before joining the service?

839
00:57:22,322 --> 00:57:23,720
I was an actuary.

840
00:57:23,722 --> 00:57:24,788
I assessed risk

841
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:27,892
based on a series of complex
mathematical equations.

842
00:57:27,894 --> 00:57:31,930
You see, people lie,
but numbers don't.

843
00:57:31,932 --> 00:57:34,668
And from where I stand,
Hellboy doesn't add up.

844
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:39,205
The monster inside him
cannot be denied.

845
00:57:39,207 --> 00:57:41,873
It's not personal,
it's just maths.

846
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:44,909
So, yeah, can't see
letting him live.

847
00:57:44,911 --> 00:57:49,080
Make sure it's a kill shot.
Either the heart or the brain.

848
00:57:49,082 --> 00:57:50,684
The heart it is.

849
00:57:51,985 --> 00:57:55,021
Hellboy's brain
is too small a target.

850
00:57:56,923 --> 00:57:59,824
Why does this book
have so many words?

851
00:57:59,826 --> 00:58:03,295
Let's say we find Nimue, huh?
Let's say we find her.

852
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:07,399
Then what?

853
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:11,202
Well, with a righteous fury
and a mighty fist,

854
00:58:11,204 --> 00:58:12,404
you'll smite her down.

855
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,038
Oh, now,
come on, Hellboy,

856
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,108
take your feet off
Churchill's desk, will you?

857
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:18,210
Whoa. Wicked.

858
00:58:18,212 --> 00:58:19,411
Then what?

859
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:21,714
Then we make sure she doesn't
come back for the sequel.

860
00:58:21,716 --> 00:58:22,948
Then what?

861
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:24,717
Then the world
will keep on spinning

862
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:26,152
and we'll have
another cup of tea.

863
00:58:26,154 --> 00:58:29,221
And then...

864
00:58:35,296 --> 00:58:36,362
...what?

865
00:58:36,364 --> 00:58:37,463
What are you on about?

866
00:58:37,465 --> 00:58:38,731
Just answer the question.

867
00:58:38,733 --> 00:58:43,035
And then what? Well, we fight
our next foe. It's what we do.

868
00:58:43,037 --> 00:58:44,870
- And then what?
- Guys.

869
00:58:44,872 --> 00:58:47,806
And then... What?

870
00:58:47,808 --> 00:58:51,378
You have something
to say, say it.

871
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:55,282
Your moral high ground is
founded on a pile of bullshit.

872
00:58:55,284 --> 00:58:59,084
This is the B.P.R.D.
We're the line in the sand.

873
00:58:59,086 --> 00:59:01,053
That's the thing
about sand,

874
00:59:01,055 --> 00:59:02,388
you can always draw
another line.

875
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:03,523
- Guys!
- If we weren't here,

876
00:59:03,525 --> 00:59:05,191
this would be Satan's
holiday home.

877
00:59:05,193 --> 00:59:09,362
You know, maybe if humans
weren't so keen

878
00:59:09,364 --> 00:59:11,898
on killing witches
and demons and such,

879
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:14,267
the witches
and demons and such

880
00:59:14,269 --> 00:59:16,469
wouldn't be so keen
on killing humans.

881
00:59:16,471 --> 00:59:18,471
That's a false equivalence
and you know it.

882
00:59:18,473 --> 00:59:20,106
There's gotta be
another way.

883
00:59:20,108 --> 00:59:22,208
The answer
to every threat we face

884
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:24,009
cannot be annihilation.

885
00:59:24,011 --> 00:59:26,446
There's gotta be
a world where monsters

886
00:59:26,448 --> 00:59:28,481
don't have to hide
in the shadows,

887
00:59:28,483 --> 00:59:32,185
where they don't have to live
in fear. Where monsters...

888
00:59:32,187 --> 00:59:34,521
Has she got to you? Nimue,

889
00:59:34,523 --> 00:59:37,290
she got to you
with her perfumed words

890
00:59:37,292 --> 00:59:38,892
and her perky breasts?

891
00:59:38,894 --> 00:59:40,794
- So stupid!
- Oh!

892
00:59:40,796 --> 00:59:42,963
I'm not even
talking about her!

893
00:59:42,965 --> 00:59:44,133
Then who?

894
00:59:48,036 --> 00:59:51,338
We face every mystical and
metaphysical threat there is,

895
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:54,542
and yet you take me in. Why?

896
00:59:54,544 --> 00:59:56,745
You were sent to kill me.

897
00:59:57,879 --> 00:59:59,449
What changed your mind?

898
01:00:01,184 --> 01:00:02,116
You did.

899
01:00:02,118 --> 01:00:04,884
You gave me a gun
on my tenth birthday!

900
01:00:04,886 --> 01:00:06,554
You sent me into
the Wildungen forest

901
01:00:06,556 --> 01:00:08,588
to hunt a pack
of wild hill trolls!

902
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:09,956
Here we go again.

903
01:00:09,958 --> 01:00:13,527
No, we didn't play
Snakes and Ladders.

904
01:00:13,529 --> 01:00:15,161
We didn't play Go Fish.

905
01:00:15,163 --> 01:00:18,064
I didn't coach you
in football or baseball.

906
01:00:18,066 --> 01:00:20,033
You made me a goddamn weapon.

907
01:00:20,035 --> 01:00:24,071
I just wanted to help you
become the best you.

908
01:00:24,073 --> 01:00:28,075
If you, uh, loved me,

909
01:00:28,077 --> 01:00:31,178
maybe you could talk to
some of your human friends

910
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:33,079
that would want to
see me dead,

911
01:00:33,081 --> 01:00:35,216
rather than unleashing me

912
01:00:35,218 --> 01:00:40,523
to slaughter
my brothers and sisters!

913
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,895
What?

914
01:00:47,163 --> 01:00:50,197
Just solid parenting.

915
01:00:50,199 --> 01:00:52,101
Goddamn humans.

916
01:00:58,141 --> 01:01:00,476
<i>Going up.</i>

917
01:01:04,514 --> 01:01:06,015
<i>Going down.</i>

918
01:01:08,084 --> 01:01:09,584
I pushed up!

919
01:01:09,586 --> 01:01:11,255
<i>Going down.</i>

920
01:01:13,257 --> 01:01:15,257
- Up!
- <i>Going down.</i>

921
01:01:15,259 --> 01:01:16,460
What the fuck?

922
01:01:18,562 --> 01:01:21,562
- Up! Up! Up! Up!
- <i>Down. Down. Down. Down.</i>

923
01:01:21,564 --> 01:01:23,600
<i>Down. Down. Down.</i>

924
01:01:27,504 --> 01:01:29,003
<i>Going down.</i>

925
01:01:47,957 --> 01:01:49,491
<i>Lower ground.</i>

926
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,343
Baba Yaga.

927
01:02:57,161 --> 01:02:58,195
Oh!

928
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:00,229
Whoa.

929
01:03:00,231 --> 01:03:01,266
Whoa!

930
01:03:14,078 --> 01:03:18,384
Baba? Baba Yaga!

931
01:03:21,219 --> 01:03:23,254
Ah, cut the crap.

932
01:03:24,589 --> 01:03:26,491
I know you're here.

933
01:03:28,326 --> 01:03:30,429
Why'd you summon me?

934
01:03:31,262 --> 01:03:34,231
You wanna play games, huh?

935
01:03:34,233 --> 01:03:36,667
Tell you what,
let's break out the <i>Yahtzee.</i>

936
01:03:36,669 --> 01:03:38,302
Otherwise, I'm not interested.

937
01:03:38,304 --> 01:03:41,071
I felt your hunger,

938
01:03:41,073 --> 01:03:44,710
and I have prepared
a feast for you.

939
01:04:22,314 --> 01:04:24,314
Don't you look lovely.

940
01:04:24,316 --> 01:04:29,821
Most think me grotesque.
An old hag with one eye.

941
01:04:29,823 --> 01:04:32,756
Oh, no, not me.

942
01:04:32,758 --> 01:04:36,660
Probably because
you did this to me!

943
01:04:36,662 --> 01:04:39,597
I recall
you trying to raise

944
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:43,668
Stalin's ghost
from the Necropolis.

945
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:45,837
I had to do something
to stop you.

946
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:49,207
So you shot out my eye

947
01:04:49,209 --> 01:04:52,479
and put me in this prison.

948
01:04:53,547 --> 01:04:55,648
You know, I thought
that banishing you

949
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:58,618
to an adjacent dimension
was, uh,

950
01:04:59,218 --> 01:05:00,687
kinda clever.

951
01:05:02,622 --> 01:05:06,324
Come. Sit.

952
01:05:06,326 --> 01:05:07,761
Eat.

953
01:05:09,396 --> 01:05:10,628
Uh...

954
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:15,634
Yeah. Quite a spread
for just two people.

955
01:05:15,636 --> 01:05:18,573
We celebrate her return.

956
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,339
Nimue?

957
01:05:22,309 --> 01:05:26,244
You are correct
to applaud her righteousness.

958
01:05:26,246 --> 01:05:29,614
In her world,
you will be hailed a hero!

959
01:05:29,616 --> 01:05:34,452
They will build statues
of you, 2,000 feet high!

960
01:05:34,454 --> 01:05:38,426
Made from the bones
of your enemies.

961
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,860
That'd take a shit-ton
of bones.

962
01:05:41,862 --> 01:05:43,364
What is for dinner?

963
01:05:53,708 --> 01:05:55,474
Is that a child?

964
01:05:55,476 --> 01:05:57,645
It's just a human child.

965
01:06:18,733 --> 01:06:19,734
Eat.

966
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:22,936
Oh, God!

967
01:06:22,938 --> 01:06:25,705
So clumsy. Sorry about that.
I gotta go.

968
01:06:25,707 --> 01:06:27,641
Gotta be there
for that resurrection.

969
01:06:27,643 --> 01:06:29,308
Gonna be better
than The Beatles!

970
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:31,313
I can help you.

971
01:06:35,249 --> 01:06:36,751
You can, can't you?

972
01:06:40,254 --> 01:06:42,588
You know where Nimue is,
don't you?

973
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:45,625
Such nice eyes.

974
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:47,696
Yellow as piss.

975
01:06:48,497 --> 01:06:51,965
My favorite color.

976
01:06:51,967 --> 01:06:56,404
I want one to replace
what you took from me.

977
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:59,338
That's not
gonna happen, sister.

978
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:02,642
Your time
is running out, demon.

979
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:05,712
Once Nimue's resurrection
is complete,

980
01:07:05,714 --> 01:07:09,649
her plague will strip
the flesh from bodies.

981
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:12,352
All right,
fine, take it.

982
01:07:12,354 --> 01:07:14,754
Just tell me
where to find Nimue first.

983
01:07:14,756 --> 01:07:18,358
This is a sacred bargain.

984
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:21,661
Once made,
it cannot be broken.

985
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:23,563
What, do you want it
in writing?

986
01:07:23,565 --> 01:07:25,498
No need.

987
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,502
Let's seal it
with a kiss.

988
01:07:35,277 --> 01:07:37,345
How do you have
hair on your tongue?

989
01:07:42,618 --> 01:07:45,051
Go to Pendle Hill.

990
01:07:45,053 --> 01:07:47,654
She will need to
reclaim her blood

991
01:07:47,656 --> 01:07:50,323
in order
to restore her power.

992
01:07:50,325 --> 01:07:54,061
You only have
until midnight.

993
01:07:54,063 --> 01:07:57,397
Which shall it be,
the right

994
01:07:57,399 --> 01:07:59,001
or the left?

995
01:08:01,037 --> 01:08:04,538
Now, this will hurt a lot.

996
01:08:05,675 --> 01:08:08,677
- You swore!
- You'll get your eye.

997
01:08:09,511 --> 01:08:11,411
Soon as I'm done with it.

998
01:08:11,413 --> 01:08:13,848
We never specified
a time frame.

999
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:15,317
Should've been more specific.

1000
01:08:35,438 --> 01:08:37,538
You've been eating children!

1001
01:08:44,814 --> 01:08:47,381
Go!
Take your eyes

1002
01:08:47,383 --> 01:08:48,952
and have them for a while.

1003
01:08:52,456 --> 01:08:55,023
But cheat me
and here's my curse,

1004
01:08:55,025 --> 01:08:57,124
that you have two eyes

1005
01:08:57,126 --> 01:09:00,028
to see the thing
you love most in the world

1006
01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:02,530
suffer and die!

1007
01:09:11,942 --> 01:09:15,477
So, are you just not
using doors anymore?

1008
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:18,014
Don't keep us in suspense.

1009
01:09:18,016 --> 01:09:20,918
I just had a visit
from Baba Yaga.

1010
01:09:21,885 --> 01:09:24,820
The Blood Queen's
in Pendle Hill.

1011
01:09:28,125 --> 01:09:29,793
We're on a clock!

1012
01:09:32,496 --> 01:09:33,461
Glad to see

1013
01:09:33,463 --> 01:09:35,497
you've straightened
your priorities out.

1014
01:09:35,499 --> 01:09:38,500
I'm not taking orders
from you, old man!

1015
01:09:38,502 --> 01:09:41,471
I'm just drawing my own line
in the sand!

1016
01:09:44,875 --> 01:09:47,444
Somebody, please,
get me a mint!

1017
01:10:00,992 --> 01:10:03,494
It has been a long time,
old friend.

1018
01:10:13,804 --> 01:10:16,739
This is sick.

1019
01:10:16,741 --> 01:10:19,175
Do you know what they did
to the witches at Pendle Hill?

1020
01:10:19,177 --> 01:10:22,178
They cut off their tongues,
fed them to maggots

1021
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:24,782
and buried them alive
right there on the spot.

1022
01:10:28,553 --> 01:10:31,454
Don't believe everything
you read on the Internet.

1023
01:10:31,456 --> 01:10:32,487
What did I say?

1024
01:10:32,489 --> 01:10:35,559
Ridding the world of evil
is a dirty business.

1025
01:10:36,794 --> 01:10:38,897
What's with you
and monsters, anyway?

1026
01:10:39,964 --> 01:10:42,133
One of them touch you
funny as a kid?

1027
01:10:43,835 --> 01:10:45,935
I've been seeing
freaky shit my whole life,

1028
01:10:45,937 --> 01:10:47,570
and if it's
taught me anything,

1029
01:10:47,572 --> 01:10:50,173
it's that hate hides behind
the most righteous faces.

1030
01:10:50,175 --> 01:10:54,177
Are you seriously gonna
lecture me about faces?

1031
01:10:54,179 --> 01:10:56,915
Maybe you think I got
these scars from shaving.

1032
01:10:59,617 --> 01:11:03,085
What happened?
I'm not gonna stop asking.

1033
01:11:03,087 --> 01:11:04,722
You might as well tell me.

1034
01:11:08,526 --> 01:11:11,527
My unit was on
a training exercise in Belize.

1035
01:11:11,529 --> 01:11:15,132
One of the local tribal elders
came to us asking for help.

1036
01:11:15,134 --> 01:11:18,070
Their village was under attack
by a man-eater.

1037
01:11:19,771 --> 01:11:22,605
It would come at night,
carry off its prey.

1038
01:11:24,642 --> 01:11:25,943
Mostly men,
but sometimes

1039
01:11:25,945 --> 01:11:27,144
it was women
and children, too.

1040
01:11:31,917 --> 01:11:33,852
Savage. Smart.

1041
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:37,221
Totally without remorse.

1042
01:11:37,223 --> 01:11:39,923
<i>All the while
that we were hunting it,</i>

1043
01:11:39,925 --> 01:11:41,928
<i>in reality, it was hunting us.</i>

1044
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,102
I was the only survivor.

1045
01:11:51,971 --> 01:11:53,772
I'm so sorry.

1046
01:11:55,808 --> 01:11:57,808
We're coming up on target.

1047
01:12:04,084 --> 01:12:06,184
There's no way
we can land on that hill.

1048
01:12:06,186 --> 01:12:07,853
I'll get us up
as close as I can.

1049
01:12:13,058 --> 01:12:15,259
Here you go, Queen.
You'll be back to feeling

1050
01:12:15,261 --> 01:12:18,162
your amazing old self
in no time.

1051
01:12:18,164 --> 01:12:20,731
My life blood sustains you...

1052
01:12:21,868 --> 01:12:24,771
But now I must reclaim
what is mine.

1053
01:12:28,842 --> 01:12:30,575
The others will be here soon.

1054
01:12:30,577 --> 01:12:31,842
What about Hellboy?

1055
01:12:31,844 --> 01:12:35,248
If he comes, I have
a little surprise in store.

1056
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:39,017
Come on,
it's almost midnight!

1057
01:12:39,019 --> 01:12:40,151
Time's running out.

1058
01:12:40,153 --> 01:12:43,921
Wait! Wait!
Just wait!

1059
01:12:45,825 --> 01:12:49,261
I'm not a demon or a soldier.
I'm fucking knackered.

1060
01:12:49,263 --> 01:12:52,133
- Just give us a sec.
- All right.

1061
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,534
Let me give you...

1062
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:57,902
A hand!

1063
01:13:02,976 --> 01:13:05,143
Won't anything in this country
stay buried!

1064
01:13:12,186 --> 01:13:14,721
Not now!

1065
01:13:55,129 --> 01:13:58,130
Hellboy! It's almost midnight.

1066
01:13:58,132 --> 01:13:59,898
Go find the Blood Queen.
We can handle this.

1067
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:01,700
She'll spread her plague
if you don't stop her!

1068
01:14:01,702 --> 01:14:03,303
There's no time! Go!

1069
01:14:03,305 --> 01:14:05,271
Alice, I'm not leaving you.

1070
01:14:05,273 --> 01:14:07,674
Go! Stop Nimue!

1071
01:14:09,343 --> 01:14:11,243
I'm out.
Stay behind me!

1072
01:14:11,245 --> 01:14:13,114
Where the fuck else
am I gonna go?

1073
01:14:14,982 --> 01:14:16,449
Goal!

1074
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:28,230
At last...

1075
01:14:29,397 --> 01:14:31,231
I am reborn.

1076
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:33,999
Yeah, you're looking good,
Your Majesty.

1077
01:14:34,001 --> 01:14:36,904
She's the queen
of the castle.

1078
01:14:38,973 --> 01:14:41,209
They're here,
my Queen.

1079
01:14:55,856 --> 01:14:58,091
They've come
from out of the darkness

1080
01:14:58,093 --> 01:15:00,260
to celebrate your return.

1081
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:04,831
No more bowing and scraping,
my beloveds.

1082
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:07,468
That is not what I want.

1083
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:11,838
I want an army,

1084
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,742
long hidden
from the eyes of man.

1085
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:19,479
I want the forgotten people
out of the dark!

1086
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:22,215
Those who have lived in dust,

1087
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:26,186
who have gnawed on dry bones
while dreaming of blood!

1088
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:30,157
That is what I want.
Give me an army like that

1089
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:32,959
and we will make
the daytime world weep!

1090
01:15:39,302 --> 01:15:43,304
Well, don't just cower
there like mice.

1091
01:15:43,306 --> 01:15:44,806
Step forth.

1092
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:47,376
Ah.

1093
01:15:48,009 --> 01:15:50,044
Dear sisters.

1094
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:52,879
How kind of you to grace me
with your presence

1095
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:55,149
after hiding all these years.

1096
01:15:55,151 --> 01:15:59,322
Please, Nimue, for me
and my sisters, have mercy.

1097
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:04,259
Ganeida, did you
show me mercy?

1098
01:16:09,265 --> 01:16:11,532
When Arthur
cut me to pieces

1099
01:16:11,534 --> 01:16:13,502
and buried me alive,

1100
01:16:14,971 --> 01:16:17,807
where was your mercy then?

1101
01:16:19,476 --> 01:16:22,310
- Don't, I beg you!
- Look at you.

1102
01:16:22,312 --> 01:16:24,381
Groveling like an animal.

1103
01:16:25,549 --> 01:16:29,050
Don't worry, Ganeida,
I won't kill you.

1104
01:16:29,953 --> 01:16:32,319
But you must do something
for me first

1105
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:35,356
to prove
your newfound loyalty.

1106
01:16:35,358 --> 01:16:38,192
Take Hellboy to the one
who can show him his destiny.

1107
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:44,566
Oh, sorry!
Did I interrupt?

1108
01:16:44,568 --> 01:16:47,037
Hellboy, you bastard!

1109
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:02,986
I hope I'm not late
to the party!

1110
01:17:08,525 --> 01:17:10,427
You've arrived
just in time.

1111
01:17:15,098 --> 01:17:16,234
There's too many.

1112
01:17:18,869 --> 01:17:19,969
Get off him!

1113
01:17:26,276 --> 01:17:27,342
Behind you!

1114
01:17:40,058 --> 01:17:41,490
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

1115
01:17:41,492 --> 01:17:43,358
I don't know. Ever since
the fairies took me,

1116
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:44,926
I've been able to do
some weird shit.

1117
01:17:44,928 --> 01:17:46,227
Stay behind me.

1118
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:48,296
Where else am I gonna go?

1119
01:17:48,298 --> 01:17:49,898
Get us out of here!

1120
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:52,100
Know when to wait.

1121
01:17:52,102 --> 01:17:54,670
Not so fucking
funny now, eh?

1122
01:17:54,672 --> 01:17:58,674
My Queen, restore me now!
Let me finish him!

1123
01:17:58,676 --> 01:18:00,376
Not just yet.

1124
01:18:00,378 --> 01:18:01,911
But you swore...

1125
01:18:01,913 --> 01:18:03,979
- Ow!
- Mind your tongue, pig.

1126
01:18:03,981 --> 01:18:06,148
Move it.

1127
01:18:06,150 --> 01:18:07,185
Get in.

1128
01:18:11,255 --> 01:18:12,221
Hey.

1129
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:14,359
Where do you
think you're going?

1130
01:18:17,295 --> 01:18:19,295
To give birth to a new world!

1131
01:18:19,297 --> 01:18:22,599
Yeah, by killing
a lot of innocent people!

1132
01:18:23,602 --> 01:18:27,203
Why do you fight for those
who hate and fear you?

1133
01:18:27,205 --> 01:18:30,374
All I wanted was revenge,
until I saw you.

1134
01:18:30,376 --> 01:18:32,975
You can usher
in the apocalypse.

1135
01:18:32,977 --> 01:18:36,178
Out of the ashes,
a new Eden will emerge.

1136
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:39,014
Leave these frail,
pathetic humans behind.

1137
01:18:39,016 --> 01:18:43,219
Be my king. And be revered
for who you really are.

1138
01:18:43,221 --> 01:18:46,055
We belong together,
you and I.

1139
01:18:46,057 --> 01:18:48,225
We do! But it's not
gonna work, you know,

1140
01:18:48,227 --> 01:18:52,498
'cause I'm a Capricorn
and you're fucking nuts!

1141
01:18:54,166 --> 01:18:57,667
A demon sleeps inside you,
and I will waken it.

1142
01:18:57,669 --> 01:19:00,104
Hellboy! Hellboy!

1143
01:19:03,242 --> 01:19:05,575
Even if I have to
take away everything

1144
01:19:05,577 --> 01:19:08,046
and everyone
you've ever loved.

1145
01:19:12,284 --> 01:19:14,119
I got you, kid.

1146
01:19:18,023 --> 01:19:20,958
Congratulations,
the Blood Queen has all her powers now.

1147
01:19:22,261 --> 01:19:23,760
Don't touch it!

1148
01:19:23,762 --> 01:19:25,164
It'll only make it
spread faster.

1149
01:19:27,566 --> 01:19:30,634
You got three seconds
to make this right!

1150
01:19:30,636 --> 01:19:31,702
I can't.

1151
01:19:31,704 --> 01:19:33,003
Three.

1152
01:19:33,005 --> 01:19:34,705
Nimue's power is too strong.

1153
01:19:34,707 --> 01:19:36,441
Two.

1154
01:19:36,443 --> 01:19:39,410
There is one who can help you
from the Old World.

1155
01:19:39,412 --> 01:19:40,344
Where?

1156
01:19:40,346 --> 01:19:42,113
You're not seriously
gonna listen to her!

1157
01:19:42,115 --> 01:19:43,713
She could be leading us
straight into a trap!

1158
01:19:43,715 --> 01:19:46,351
You can save your friend.

1159
01:19:50,723 --> 01:19:52,657
We don't have a choice.

1160
01:19:52,659 --> 01:19:54,126
Go to Black Fin.

1161
01:19:55,294 --> 01:19:56,494
<i>High atop the cliffs</i>

1162
01:19:56,496 --> 01:19:58,763
<i>there's an old goat path
hidden in the rocks.</i>

1163
01:19:58,765 --> 01:20:00,598
<i>The way is treacherous,</i>

1164
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:04,335
<i>but you must follow it
until you can go no further.</i>

1165
01:20:04,337 --> 01:20:07,071
<i>There, you'll find a passage
into the bowels of the Earth,</i>

1166
01:20:07,073 --> 01:20:08,138
<i>in a cave.</i>

1167
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:09,172
This way, Daimio.

1168
01:20:09,174 --> 01:20:11,074
<i>The one
you seek is there.</i>

1169
01:20:11,076 --> 01:20:12,610
<i>Merlin the Wise.</i>

1170
01:20:12,612 --> 01:20:15,813
<i>Wizard to kings,
and king of fools.</i>

1171
01:20:15,815 --> 01:20:18,483
<i>Cursed to live forever
buried in a hole</i>

1172
01:20:18,485 --> 01:20:21,120
<i>for allowing Arthur
to betray the truce.</i>

1173
01:20:30,831 --> 01:20:33,631
Have you finally come
to claim my soul?

1174
01:20:33,633 --> 01:20:35,100
That's the other guy.

1175
01:20:36,536 --> 01:20:39,770
Come on!
My friend's been poisoned,

1176
01:20:39,772 --> 01:20:42,041
and we were told
that you can help!

1177
01:20:46,112 --> 01:20:50,349
I have seen this before.
This is Nimue's work.

1178
01:20:50,351 --> 01:20:52,184
You cannot underestimate
this witch.

1179
01:20:52,186 --> 01:20:54,653
She is evil incarnate.

1180
01:20:54,655 --> 01:20:56,487
There's still a chance
if we act quickly.

1181
01:20:56,489 --> 01:20:58,456
But you must promise me
something in return.

1182
01:20:58,458 --> 01:21:00,692
That you will do
whatever is necessary

1183
01:21:00,694 --> 01:21:03,194
to destroy Nimue,
no matter the cost.

1184
01:21:03,196 --> 01:21:05,499
I can damn well guarantee it.

1185
01:21:27,755 --> 01:21:30,090
Should we be worried
about where that's going?

1186
01:21:31,859 --> 01:21:33,225
Hey.

1187
01:21:33,227 --> 01:21:34,493
Hey.

1188
01:21:34,495 --> 01:21:35,764
Welcome back.

1189
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,500
Who's the new guy?

1190
01:21:40,502 --> 01:21:42,637
You wouldn't
believe me if I told you.

1191
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:46,605
Hey, hey!
Why did you do that?

1192
01:21:46,607 --> 01:21:48,874
Let your friends rest.
They'll be fine.

1193
01:21:48,876 --> 01:21:51,911
What comes next is for you
and you alone.

1194
01:21:51,913 --> 01:21:55,648
Hellboy, your story
whispered itself into my ear

1195
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:58,283
and I realized
fate had something else

1196
01:21:58,285 --> 01:21:59,485
in store for us both.

1197
01:21:59,487 --> 01:22:02,322
- Okay.
- Tell me,

1198
01:22:02,324 --> 01:22:06,192
are there still tales
of King Arthur in your time?

1199
01:22:06,194 --> 01:22:08,527
How he drew the sword
from the stone?

1200
01:22:08,529 --> 01:22:09,896
Uh, yeah. Movies, too.

1201
01:22:09,898 --> 01:22:11,898
He's a regular
pop culture phenom.

1202
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:14,266
Give me your hand.

1203
01:22:14,268 --> 01:22:16,436
People believe
that Arthur's lineage

1204
01:22:16,438 --> 01:22:19,204
died with him,
but it's not true.

1205
01:22:19,206 --> 01:22:22,208
The bloodline continued
when Arthur had a daughter

1206
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:25,545
and that daughter
had a daughter, and so on.

1207
01:22:25,547 --> 01:22:28,615
<i>Ending with
Sarah Bethany Hughes.</i>

1208
01:22:28,617 --> 01:22:30,684
She used to fly to the Sabbath

1209
01:22:30,686 --> 01:22:33,253
on the back of a demon
in the shape of a goat.

1210
01:22:33,955 --> 01:22:37,457
<i>And on Walpurgis Night, 1574,</i>

1211
01:22:37,459 --> 01:22:39,594
<i>she married that demon.</i>

1212
01:22:43,498 --> 01:22:45,868
That very night
she was taken down to hell,

1213
01:22:47,302 --> 01:22:49,535
<i>where she delivered a son,</i>

1214
01:22:49,537 --> 01:22:51,538
Anung un Rama.

1215
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:53,974
That last part, I've heard
that before. What is that?

1216
01:22:53,976 --> 01:22:57,877
It's you...
Anung un Rama.

1217
01:22:57,879 --> 01:23:00,948
Destroyer of all things.

1218
01:23:00,950 --> 01:23:03,752
The title you were given
on the day you were born.

1219
01:23:04,954 --> 01:23:08,889
So, my mother was human.

1220
01:23:08,891 --> 01:23:12,258
And so are you.
At least in part.

1221
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:16,399
Son of Arthur,
last of the royal lineage.

1222
01:23:18,267 --> 01:23:19,766
Blood of his blood.

1223
01:23:19,768 --> 01:23:21,904
Destined to be king of man.

1224
01:23:25,908 --> 01:23:27,908
Which is why
I know you are

1225
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:30,577
the only one who can
do what must be done.

1226
01:23:32,915 --> 01:23:37,420
Excalibur, the one weapon
that can stand against Nimue.

1227
01:23:38,654 --> 01:23:41,956
Ah, looks bigger
in the cartoon.

1228
01:23:41,958 --> 01:23:46,292
Only a true descendant
of Arthur can wield it.

1229
01:23:46,294 --> 01:23:49,932
It is your birthright,
Hellboy, your destiny.

1230
01:23:56,605 --> 01:24:00,844
This is how you will destroy
the Blood Queen.

1231
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:02,570
No! You gave me your word!

1232
01:25:02,572 --> 01:25:05,440
Take the sword
before it's too late!

1233
01:25:05,442 --> 01:25:06,510
Take it!

1234
01:25:07,511 --> 01:25:08,846
Take it now!

1235
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:10,915
You fool!

1236
01:25:12,349 --> 01:25:16,685
I used the last of my magic
to bring Excalibur here.

1237
01:25:16,687 --> 01:25:19,654
Now the sword
has returned to Arthur,

1238
01:25:19,656 --> 01:25:22,025
the only man worthy of it.

1239
01:25:22,959 --> 01:25:24,896
You could've stopped her.

1240
01:25:25,695 --> 01:25:27,830
At least I won't be here

1241
01:25:27,832 --> 01:25:31,602
to watch the world
wither and die.

1242
01:25:50,054 --> 01:25:52,888
Run!
Yeah, go on, run.

1243
01:25:52,890 --> 01:25:54,325
You pathetic bastards.

1244
01:26:04,736 --> 01:26:06,468
<i>So far,
the British government</i>

1245
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:08,737
<i>has failed to pinpoint
the origin of the plague</i>

1246
01:26:08,739 --> 01:26:11,574
<i>which is spreading
at an unprecedented rate.</i>

1247
01:26:11,576 --> 01:26:13,075
<i>The Prime Minister
has declared</i>

1248
01:26:13,077 --> 01:26:14,743
<i>an official state of emergency</i>

1249
01:26:14,745 --> 01:26:17,913
<i>and is urging British citizens
to remain indoors</i>

1250
01:26:17,915 --> 01:26:21,952
<i>and to avoid contact with
anyone who may be infected.</i>

1251
01:26:21,954 --> 01:26:26,456
<i>Casualties are expected to
reach 100,000 within two hours,</i>

1252
01:26:26,458 --> 01:26:28,758
<i>with the British plague
spreading to the EU</i>

1253
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:30,794
<i>resulting in
massive fatalities</i>

1254

<i>over the next 24 hours</i>

1255
01:26:31,963 --> 01:26:34,530
<i>and threatening to spark
a global epidemic.</i>

1256
01:26:34,532 --> 01:26:35,798
Listen up, ladies and gentlemen.

1257
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,600
The shit has gone
way beyond the fan.

1258
01:26:37,602 --> 01:26:40,502
Out there, there's
a fifth century sorceress

1259
01:26:40,504 --> 01:26:41,605
and her pig monster,

1260
01:26:41,607 --> 01:26:43,106
who want to bring down
the curtain

1261
01:26:43,108 --> 01:26:44,941
on London and the world.

1262
01:26:44,943 --> 01:26:47,911
Now, please tell me
where the fuck they are!

1263
01:26:56,687 --> 01:26:58,522
I need to see some ID, love.

1264
01:27:06,266 --> 01:27:08,632
<i>The infection rate is
much higher than initially...</i>

1265
01:27:08,634 --> 01:27:10,901
You gonna tell us
what happened down there?

1266
01:27:10,903 --> 01:27:11,936
Where's Gandalf?

1267
01:27:11,938 --> 01:27:15,106
He's dead. He offered me
the sword, Excalibur.

1268
01:27:15,108 --> 01:27:18,576
He said it was the only way
to kill the Blood Queen.

1269
01:27:18,578 --> 01:27:20,143
All right,
so where is it?

1270
01:27:20,145 --> 01:27:21,845
I didn't take the sword.

1271
01:27:21,847 --> 01:27:23,480
'Cause if I do,
I'm the guy who's gonna

1272
01:27:23,482 --> 01:27:25,482
bring about the end
of the world.

1273
01:27:25,484 --> 01:27:26,883
You're the guy
who's going to

1274
01:27:26,885 --> 01:27:29,653
bring about
the end of the world?

1275
01:27:29,655 --> 01:27:31,055
Get over yourself.

1276
01:27:31,057 --> 01:27:32,223
Daimio!

1277
01:27:32,225 --> 01:27:34,426
We've got a job to do.

1278
01:27:35,762 --> 01:27:36,861
We've got to go.

1279
01:27:36,863 --> 01:27:38,162
What's wrong?

1280
01:27:38,164 --> 01:27:40,564
The Blood Queen
just took out the B.P.R.D.

1281
01:27:40,566 --> 01:27:41,734
Dad.

1282
01:28:04,258 --> 01:28:07,925
We'll find your father.
He's not dead.

1283
01:28:07,927 --> 01:28:10,560
Trust me, I'd know.

1284
01:28:10,562 --> 01:28:11,729
Have a look at this.

1285
01:28:11,731 --> 01:28:13,664
<i>I'm outside
St. Paul's Cathedral,</i>

1286
01:28:13,666 --> 01:28:14,865
<i>and right over there,</i>

1287
01:28:14,867 --> 01:28:16,767
<i>hundreds of armed police
continue a shootout</i>

1288
01:28:16,769 --> 01:28:18,569
<i>with an unknown assailant.</i>

1289
01:28:36,223 --> 01:28:38,556
Get out of the way!

1290
01:28:50,904 --> 01:28:54,172
Hey! I'm on your side!

1291
01:28:54,174 --> 01:28:57,142
- Sorry. My bad.
- M-11!

1292
01:28:57,144 --> 01:28:59,579
No one enters
under any circumstances!

1293
01:29:03,751 --> 01:29:05,052
Where is she?

1294
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:08,353
Dad!

1295
01:29:08,355 --> 01:29:10,356
Hello, Hellboy.

1296
01:29:10,358 --> 01:29:12,724
Sorry my queen
couldn't be here

1297
01:29:12,726 --> 01:29:14,028
to greet you in person.

1298
01:29:17,999 --> 01:29:19,264
That's not a good sign.

1299
01:29:19,266 --> 01:29:20,966
How did he get
so fucking big?

1300
01:29:20,968 --> 01:29:23,268
Hellboy, as you can see,

1301
01:29:23,270 --> 01:29:28,774
she's made sure you receive
a proper fucking welcome.

1302
01:29:28,776 --> 01:29:33,011
You've no idea how long
I've been waiting for this.

1303
01:29:33,013 --> 01:29:34,713
I have some idea!

1304
01:29:34,715 --> 01:29:38,885
You know, I was the guy
that sent little piggy squealing

1305
01:29:38,887 --> 01:29:40,853
all the way back home.

1306
01:29:40,855 --> 01:29:42,687
Take cover!

1307
01:29:45,726 --> 01:29:47,726
I'll rip your fucking head off!

1308
01:29:58,706 --> 01:30:00,708
Look out!

1309
01:30:03,912 --> 01:30:06,912
Little piggy, I brought
your favorite! Iron!

1310
01:30:09,217 --> 01:30:11,716
That's not gonna
work this time.

1311
01:30:11,718 --> 01:30:13,219
It won't budge!

1312
01:30:20,429 --> 01:30:23,763
Take that, you fucker!

1313
01:30:23,765 --> 01:30:25,066
Come here, you...

1314
01:30:25,767 --> 01:30:27,000
Fucking bastard.

1315
01:30:37,178 --> 01:30:39,979
Get out of here.

1316
01:30:39,981 --> 01:30:41,716
I'm not just gonna leave you!

1317
01:30:52,995 --> 01:30:54,796
Go!

1318
01:31:03,339 --> 01:31:04,639
Fuck off!

1319
01:31:48,184 --> 01:31:51,519
Look at ya. You got a face
like a baboon's ass.

1320
01:31:51,521 --> 01:31:55,923
Now just lay there and bleed
while I finish you off.

1321
01:31:55,925 --> 01:31:57,091
Oh, yeah?

1322
01:31:57,093 --> 01:31:59,196
Good luck with that, pal!

1323
01:32:01,097 --> 01:32:02,432
Huh?

1324
01:32:10,906 --> 01:32:11,907
Fucking mutt.

1325
01:32:14,843 --> 01:32:16,947
Daimio?

1326
01:32:18,215 --> 01:32:20,317
Let's eat some barbecue!

1327
01:32:31,994 --> 01:32:33,860
- Hellboy!
- Whoa!

1328
01:32:33,862 --> 01:32:35,196
What am I supposed
to do with that?

1329
01:32:35,198 --> 01:32:36,732
Improvise!

1330
01:32:57,921 --> 01:33:00,221
I'm gonna squash
your fucking head now.

1331
01:33:00,223 --> 01:33:02,759
- Here, you red-faced twat!
- Enough!

1332
01:33:03,427 --> 01:33:05,093
Your Majesty.

1333
01:33:05,095 --> 01:33:07,999
Let him go, my pet.

1334
01:33:09,433 --> 01:33:12,468
We had a deal.
I found you.

1335
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:17,106
I set all this in motion!
I was the beginning of it all.

1336
01:33:17,108 --> 01:33:19,040
And I am the end.

1337
01:33:20,411 --> 01:33:25,947
Forgive me. I needed someone
to challenge Hellboy,

1338
01:33:25,949 --> 01:33:27,383
push him to the edge.

1339
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:31,287
But you promised!

1340
01:33:31,289 --> 01:33:33,956
To make you whole again.

1341
01:33:33,958 --> 01:33:36,025
Powerful beyond compare.

1342
01:33:37,261 --> 01:33:40,929
And for one brief,
shining moment,

1343
01:33:40,931 --> 01:33:42,899
- you were.
- This ain't fair!

1344
01:33:43,634 --> 01:33:48,470
Fuck you, Hellboy!

1345
01:33:48,472 --> 01:33:50,306
Yeah, fuck you back.

1346
01:33:50,308 --> 01:33:54,544
All right,
time to finish this.

1347
01:33:54,546 --> 01:33:57,179
But I don't want
to kill you.

1348
01:33:57,181 --> 01:34:00,916
We are not enemies.
We are bound together by fate!

1349
01:34:00,918 --> 01:34:03,386
Not this crap again, lady!

1350
01:34:03,388 --> 01:34:06,258
Some lessons bear repeating.

1351
01:34:24,676 --> 01:34:27,344
Just think
how many spent their lives

1352
01:34:27,346 --> 01:34:29,680
searching for Arthur's tomb.

1353
01:34:31,450 --> 01:34:34,085
It's been right here
all along.

1354
01:34:36,355 --> 01:34:40,125
Go ahead.
It's yours by right.

1355
01:34:41,426 --> 01:34:44,363
You can feel it,
can't you?

1356
01:34:45,598 --> 01:34:47,999
How it calls to you.

1357
01:34:49,369 --> 01:34:53,036
Stirring the thing
at the core of your being.

1358
01:34:53,038 --> 01:34:56,141
The thing
you're destined to be.

1359
01:34:57,676 --> 01:35:01,244
Go ahead, take it.

1360
01:35:01,246 --> 01:35:04,116
You want to kill me,
don't you?

1361
01:35:10,490 --> 01:35:13,090
Pick up the sword.
Take it!

1362
01:35:13,092 --> 01:35:14,360
No!

1363
01:35:15,661 --> 01:35:18,595
I don't know
what your game is here,

1364
01:35:18,597 --> 01:35:21,166
but I'm done playing!

1365
01:35:25,738 --> 01:35:27,005
Very well.

1366
01:35:30,176 --> 01:35:32,143
Dad! Dad!

1367
01:35:32,145 --> 01:35:34,011
Don't worry about me.

1368
01:35:34,013 --> 01:35:37,181
You do what you have to do
and take out this bitch!

1369
01:35:37,183 --> 01:35:41,018
No! Nimue! Nimue, no!
Let him go, Nimue!

1370
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:44,189
Let him go!
It's me you want! Take me!

1371
01:35:45,324 --> 01:35:48,092
I already have you.

1372
01:35:48,094 --> 01:35:51,631
You just don't know it yet.

1373
01:35:53,533 --> 01:35:56,670
No! No! No!

1374
01:35:59,038 --> 01:36:00,239
Dad!

1375
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:02,208
Dad?

1376
01:36:04,010 --> 01:36:07,180
No. Please don't go.

1377
01:36:12,452 --> 01:36:16,189
No!

1378
01:36:18,759 --> 01:36:21,693
Jesus Christ, mate.
You're a mess.

1379
01:36:21,695 --> 01:36:23,128
Well, at least
now I know why

1380
01:36:23,130 --> 01:36:25,630
you've been acting like
such a fucking dick.

1381
01:36:25,632 --> 01:36:28,133
I need you to pull it
together now!

1382
01:36:28,135 --> 01:36:29,503
He needs our help.

1383
01:36:32,405 --> 01:36:35,072
Save your tears.

1384
01:36:35,074 --> 01:36:37,041
His death is a mercy
compared to what

1385
01:36:37,043 --> 01:36:38,645
I have in store
for the rest of mankind.

1386
01:36:40,147 --> 01:36:43,148
All because you were
too cowardly to use Excalibur

1387
01:36:43,150 --> 01:36:44,516
when you had the chance.

1388
01:36:44,518 --> 01:36:46,585
Both your fathers
would be ashamed!

1389
01:36:46,587 --> 01:36:48,155
Nimue!

1390
01:37:24,759 --> 01:37:26,393
Come to me.

1391
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:33,668
Come to me.

1392
01:37:36,237 --> 01:37:37,438
Come.

1393
01:39:11,868 --> 01:39:15,268
You're so beautiful.

1394
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:18,705
Now you see that we were
born to rule together.

1395
01:39:18,707 --> 01:39:20,607
Arthur was just a man.

1396
01:39:20,609 --> 01:39:24,444
In his hands, Excalibur was
an instrument of death.

1397
01:39:24,446 --> 01:39:27,381
But in yours,
you can build a new world,

1398
01:39:27,383 --> 01:39:31,153
a better world
for all our kind.

1399
01:39:32,956 --> 01:39:34,524
My Lord.

1400
01:40:05,656 --> 01:40:07,356
Stop!

1401
01:40:11,361 --> 01:40:15,532
This isn't you, Hellboy.
You're better than this.

1402
01:40:16,966 --> 01:40:20,535
Don't listen to this old fool.
You were meant for this.

1403
01:40:20,537 --> 01:40:22,037
She wants to use you,

1404
01:40:22,039 --> 01:40:24,773
make you into something
you're not.

1405
01:40:24,775 --> 01:40:28,309
So stop being
a whiny little shit

1406
01:40:28,311 --> 01:40:30,511
and show her she's wrong.

1407
01:40:30,513 --> 01:40:33,047
Go forth and embrace
your destiny.

1408
01:40:33,049 --> 01:40:35,416
Destroy your enemies!

1409
01:40:35,418 --> 01:40:39,922
All this bitching
and moaning about destiny.

1410
01:40:39,924 --> 01:40:42,725
Grow a pair!
You're a man!

1411
01:40:42,727 --> 01:40:45,861
And a good one!
Act like it.

1412
01:40:45,863 --> 01:40:48,964
Don't let a prophecy
tell you who you are.

1413
01:40:48,966 --> 01:40:52,068
You decide for yourself.

1414
01:40:52,070 --> 01:40:53,902
He's lying!

1415
01:40:53,904 --> 01:40:56,939
You are the great beast
of the apocalypse.

1416
01:40:56,941 --> 01:41:00,408
This is the real you!
It always has been.

1417
01:41:00,410 --> 01:41:02,544
Burn out the past.

1418
01:41:02,546 --> 01:41:05,649
Be rid of the weakness.

1419
01:41:11,056 --> 01:41:12,623
My King.

1420
01:42:12,117 --> 01:42:14,050
This isn't over!

1421
01:42:14,052 --> 01:42:15,752
We are destined
for one another!

1422
01:42:15,754 --> 01:42:17,053
We will meet again

1423
01:42:17,055 --> 01:42:20,490
on the last day
of the ending of the world!

1424
01:42:22,460 --> 01:42:25,495
Lady, quit while you're...

1425
01:42:25,497 --> 01:42:26,729
A head.

1426
01:42:26,731 --> 01:42:28,598
No! No!

1427
01:42:40,445 --> 01:42:43,548
You knew, didn't you?

1428
01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:45,852
This whole time.

1429
01:42:46,652 --> 01:42:48,788
This beast inside me.

1430
01:42:49,488 --> 01:42:50,890
My inner nature!

1431
01:42:52,024 --> 01:42:53,492
My destiny!

1432
01:42:54,626 --> 01:42:56,126
So did you.

1433
01:42:56,128 --> 01:42:59,997
Why didn't you kill me
all those years ago?

1434
01:42:59,999 --> 01:43:02,132
You had a job,

1435
01:43:02,134 --> 01:43:06,005
to protect the world
from monsters!

1436
01:43:07,473 --> 01:43:09,974
I have never, ever
regretted the decision

1437
01:43:09,976 --> 01:43:11,377
I made that night.

1438
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:15,813
Dad...

1439
01:43:15,815 --> 01:43:19,551
Shut up and listen to me.
There's things I need to say.

1440
01:43:21,020 --> 01:43:24,021
I tried to be
the best father I could.

1441
01:43:24,023 --> 01:43:26,657
What the hell did I know
about raising a kid?

1442
01:43:26,659 --> 01:43:29,226
I was a killer,
and damn good at it.

1443
01:43:29,228 --> 01:43:31,695
Some beasts deserved it,
some didn't.

1444
01:43:31,697 --> 01:43:34,865
But I did what I believed
was necessary.

1445
01:43:34,867 --> 01:43:37,068
And if I have any chance
of growing wings,

1446
01:43:37,070 --> 01:43:38,937
it's because of you.

1447
01:43:41,074 --> 01:43:42,541
You changed me.

1448
01:43:43,643 --> 01:43:46,810
You changed everything.

1449
01:43:46,812 --> 01:43:51,782
And if there is ever an end
in this seemingly forever war,

1450
01:43:51,784 --> 01:43:56,988
it will be because of you
and your strong right hand.

1451
01:43:56,990 --> 01:44:01,826
You are mankind's best
and only hope, my boy.

1452
01:44:01,828 --> 01:44:07,500
Please. Please don't go.
I'm not ready.

1453
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,936
Oh, yes, you are.

1454
01:44:10,938 --> 01:44:15,441
Being your father was
the best decision I ever made.

1455
01:44:16,575 --> 01:44:18,276
I love you, Hellboy.

1456
01:44:49,310 --> 01:44:50,876
What's that?

1457
01:44:50,878 --> 01:44:52,246
A mistake.

1458
01:44:58,051 --> 01:44:59,686
I like cats.

1459
01:45:01,788 --> 01:45:04,058
I've always been
more of a dog person.

1460
01:45:10,298 --> 01:45:12,565
So, you're the king
of England now.

1461
01:45:12,567 --> 01:45:13,766
Yup.

1462
01:45:13,768 --> 01:45:15,503
Well, I didn't
see that coming.

1463
01:45:35,890 --> 01:45:38,724
Okay,
yeah, we're here.

1464
01:45:38,726 --> 01:45:40,360
Does anybody copy?
Does any...

1465
01:45:40,362 --> 01:45:42,727
Worthless piece of crap!

1466
01:45:48,970 --> 01:45:51,037
Ah, the Oannes Society.

1467
01:45:51,039 --> 01:45:53,105
They make Osiris
look like Cub Scouts.

1468
01:45:53,107 --> 01:45:55,775
Christ!
Another secret boys club?

1469
01:45:55,777 --> 01:45:58,879
Bunch of lunatics.
What are they doing here?

1470
01:45:58,881 --> 01:46:00,814
And where's our back-up?

1471
01:46:00,816 --> 01:46:03,050
Ah! Come on!

1472
01:46:03,052 --> 01:46:05,785
Do not sneak up
on me like that!

1473
01:46:05,787 --> 01:46:08,154
Don't you ever
stop bitching?

1474
01:46:08,156 --> 01:46:10,689
I'm glad you could join us.

1475
01:46:10,691 --> 01:46:13,160
Yeah. Okay, come on,
let's get your game face on.

1476
01:46:13,162 --> 01:46:15,128
It's not something
I can just turn on and off

1477
01:46:15,130 --> 01:46:16,595
like a light switch.

1478
01:46:16,597 --> 01:46:20,167
The transformation is an electro-chemical
reaction to pain and emotional...

1479
01:46:22,805 --> 01:46:24,671
I'm sorry to say,

1480
01:46:24,673 --> 01:46:26,907
it's a bit more complicated
than that...

1481
01:46:26,909 --> 01:46:28,008
Welcome to the B.P.R.D.

1482
01:46:28,010 --> 01:46:30,310
Yeah, come on, let's do this.

1483
01:46:36,218 --> 01:46:39,054
Ah, nobody told me
there was a dress code.

1484
01:47:41,084 --> 01:47:43,986
Hey, guys,
check it out.

1485
01:47:53,497 --> 01:47:54,898
"Icthyo Sapien."

1486
01:47:55,865 --> 01:47:58,034
Anyone know
what that means?

1487
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:49,373
<i>♪ Oh, Danny boy</i>

1488
01:50:50,409 --> 01:50:55,481
<i>♪ The pipes
The pipes are call... ♪</i>

1489
01:50:59,585 --> 01:51:01,485
I mean, it's fine,
you know.

1490
01:51:01,487 --> 01:51:05,055
It's like, we got the job done
and everything.

1491
01:51:05,057 --> 01:51:06,390
I put on a happy face.

1492
01:51:06,392 --> 01:51:09,059
But just feel, I don't know,
feels kinda...

1493
01:51:09,061 --> 01:51:11,063
I feel for you, kid.

1494
01:51:12,131 --> 01:51:13,698
The Professor was a good man.

1495
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:15,868
Holy crap!

1496
01:51:17,137 --> 01:51:18,168
Listen.

1497
01:51:18,170 --> 01:51:20,270
You probably get this
all the time. And I don't...

1498
01:51:20,272 --> 01:51:22,139
I feel like such a jerk
doing this, you know?

1499
01:51:22,141 --> 01:51:24,274
But it's like,
I'm actually your biggest fan.

1500
01:51:24,276 --> 01:51:26,678
I... I... I've read about
everything you've done...

1501
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:28,713
- Let me stop you right there.
- Okay.

1502
01:51:28,715 --> 01:51:30,415
I suppose you wanna
see the claw.

1503
01:51:30,417 --> 01:51:31,418
Yeah.

1504
01:51:32,619 --> 01:51:34,252
Oh, my God!

1505
01:51:34,254 --> 01:51:35,453
It's impressive.

1506
01:51:35,455 --> 01:51:37,021
You're telling me.

1507
01:51:37,023 --> 01:51:39,557
I don't think your old man would wanna
see you sitting around here moping.

1508
01:51:39,559 --> 01:51:41,558
- No, you're probably right.
- Gotta get back in the fight.

1509
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:43,394
- Yeah.
- It's unfinished business.

1510
01:51:43,396 --> 01:51:45,429
- Yeah, okay.
- Got myself killed.

1511
01:51:45,431 --> 01:51:46,531
Well, it wasn't your fault.

1512
01:51:46,533 --> 01:51:47,998
- But listen.
- Yeah.

1513
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,501
- Big one's coming.
- Okay.

1514
01:51:49,503 --> 01:51:50,635
You won a battle.

1515
01:51:50,637 --> 01:51:53,138
Now you gotta go
kick ass in the war.

1516
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:54,474
I do?

1517
01:51:55,475 --> 01:52:01,045
Whoa! Okay! All right! Okay!

1518
01:52:01,047 --> 01:52:04,382
Now cut the shit,
buckle up,

1519
01:52:04,384 --> 01:52:07,017
get back in the fight.

1520
01:52:07,019 --> 01:52:11,322
I love you,
Lobster Johnson!

1521
01:52:11,324 --> 01:52:12,426
Okay.

1522
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:16,630
Wow. All right,
that happened.

1523
01:59:58,865 --> 02:00:02,870
He mocks me!
And I've had enough!

1524
02:00:04,005 --> 02:00:10,010
Go! Kill Hellboy
and bring me his eye!

1525
02:00:14,981 --> 02:00:17,751
Can you do that?

1526
02:00:18,685 --> 02:00:20,054
I can.

1527
02:00:20,654 --> 02:00:22,189
And if I do?

1528
02:00:23,824 --> 02:00:27,662
I will grant you
your greatest wish.

1529
02:00:29,729 --> 02:00:31,896
And that is?

1530
02:00:31,898 --> 02:00:36,904
I will finally let you die.

1531
02:00:36,906 --> 02:00:39,976

New York
February 16, 1959

3
00:00:54,323 --> 00:00:57,258
Hurry! She collapsed ten minutes ago.

4
00:01:30,165 --> 00:01:31,692
The ambulance is here.

5
00:01:59,064 --> 00:02:02,232
Saint Theresa, my sweet Jesus,
don't abandon me…

6
00:02:02,263 --> 00:02:05,428
give me strength,
I want to go on living.

7
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:07,980
Bring me back to life.

8
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:31,568
Why are you crying?

9
00:02:31,608 --> 00:02:33,911
Scram, you brats!

10
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,963
What are you doing here?

11
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,937
Why are you crying?

12
00:02:54,106 --> 00:02:56,049
Are you all alone?

13
00:02:57,307 --> 00:02:59,195
Where's your mommy?

14
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:24,980
You're her mother?
You worthless piece of trash!

15
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,381
Gotta make a living somehow.
I'm a singer.

16
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:28,918
What about your daughter?

17
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,334
What about her? She's taken care of.

18
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,382
Louis, I can't go on
waiting for you like this.

19
00:03:43,422 --> 00:03:45,658
Belleville's unbearable.

20
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:48,086
An impresario said with my talent…

21
00:03:48,126 --> 00:03:52,731
I should try Constantinople
like the singer Fréhel.

22
00:03:52,895 --> 00:03:55,196
Good news for our acrobat?

23
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:59,478
Sure…
Commendations from Clemenceau.

24
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,737
I left Edith with my mother.

25
00:04:07,903 --> 00:04:11,383
Mamma Aďcha will keep her
until my career takes off.

26
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:15,316
Louis, I've stopped waiting for you.

27
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,909
Anetta.

28
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:42,267
Anybody home?

29
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,322
Edith?

30
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:25,817
Louis?

31
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,093
Enough's enough.

32
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,869
What's this?

33
00:06:34,503 --> 00:06:35,682
Your grandchild…

34
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:38,023
Edith.

35
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,943
What a strange name.

36
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:52,289
She's a sickly child.

37
00:06:55,145 --> 00:06:56,836
Follow me.

38
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:08,578
What are you doing here?

39
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:11,619
You're so cute. What's your name?

40
00:07:11,787 --> 00:07:13,347
Back to work, Titine!

41
00:07:13,514 --> 00:07:16,297
Someone's in the upstairs toilet.

42
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:18,917
You've beautiful blue eyes.

43
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,921
Come on.

44
00:07:33,164 --> 00:07:34,758
I'm listening…

45
00:07:36,716 --> 00:07:38,342
I have to go back.

46
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:44,425
I'll be demobilized soon.
Then I'll go back to the circus.

47
00:07:45,485 --> 00:07:47,069
I came to see my cherub.

48
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,766
–Get out.
–I'm all done, Mamma Louise.

49
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:51,820
Tend the door.

50
00:07:57,581 --> 00:07:59,337
Where's her mother?

51
00:08:00,238 --> 00:08:01,700
I don't know.

52
00:08:05,838 --> 00:08:07,845
Want to leave her here?

53
00:08:09,934 --> 00:08:11,461
People will gossip.

54
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,085
People always gossip.

55
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,910
Should we take her to Mass?

56
00:08:54,705 --> 00:08:56,025
We're gonna be late.

57
00:08:56,177 --> 00:08:59,658
Enough. The world doesn't revolve
around her.

58
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:08,168
I hear we're keeping a baby.

59
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:09,680
Can we see it?

60
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,426
It's a girl, not a baby.

61
00:09:11,474 --> 00:09:13,863
–Want some bread?
–Get on!

62
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:18,153
Go on, ask her to sing.

63
00:09:20,979 --> 00:09:24,081
You'd be on the stage,
but your hair's too red.

64
00:11:02,424 --> 00:11:05,588
Titine! Titine, open up. Enough of this!

65
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:08,535
–Now what?
–She's with Edith.

66
00:11:08,697 --> 00:11:10,584
Open this door now!

67
00:11:10,746 --> 00:11:11,953
–What's going on?
–Nothing!

68
00:11:11,993 --> 00:11:15,704
Get ready, the gentlemen
will be here soon.

69
00:11:16,538 --> 00:11:19,059
–Open up or else!
–I can't work.

70
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,218
–I can't work!
–Really!

71
00:11:23,386 --> 00:11:25,459
You think this is a hotel?

72
00:11:26,234 --> 00:11:29,202
I'm keeping Edith. I'm keeping her.

73
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,575
That's what you think!

74
00:11:32,828 --> 00:11:34,256
It's me, open up.

75
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,086
Your legionnaire's here.

76
00:11:36,251 --> 00:11:37,659
I don't care.

77
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,951
He's a liar.
He tells me nothing but lies.

78
00:11:41,115 --> 00:11:43,122
Titine, stop this right now.

79
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:46,586
Come out
or you'll be on the street so fast!

80
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:49,268
Enough of your antics!

81
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,714
I don't want trouble.

82
00:12:23,646 --> 00:12:25,108
Doug!

83
00:12:29,855 --> 00:12:31,709
What? Are you jealous?

84
00:12:33,214 --> 00:12:36,151
I sent your Billie Holiday records
to the hotel.

85
00:12:36,191 --> 00:12:37,379
Thank you, Loulou.

86
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:40,952
Billie and I were born
the same year. Funny!

87
00:12:43,231 --> 00:12:45,238
I brought my sketches.

88
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,116
Do you want to see them now or later?

89
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,628
Later. I've got to sing that fool's song.

90
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,777
Before your time…

91
00:12:55,968 --> 00:12:57,080
What?

92
00:12:57,248 --> 00:12:58,231
Forget it.

93
00:13:00,576 --> 00:13:02,005
Let's go.

94
00:13:25,665 --> 00:13:27,160
I'm ready.

95
00:13:27,745 --> 00:13:29,152
Let's go.

96
00:14:46,823 --> 00:14:48,383
It's Jeanne!

97
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:53,442
Jeanne, what's wrong?

98
00:14:54,151 --> 00:14:56,355
–There's blood…
–Talk to us!

99
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,967
He wanted to play doctor,
with his instruments.

100
00:15:00,136 --> 00:15:01,249
The bastard!

101
00:15:03,751 --> 00:15:05,093
Titine!

102
00:15:05,255 --> 00:15:06,717
We must tell Madam.

103
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:09,125
She'll kill me. It hurts.

104
00:15:12,073 --> 00:15:14,080
I can't see!

105
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,272
–Well, doctor?
–Her health's fragile.

106
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:38,467
It's her cornea. She has keratitis.

107
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,708
Is she blind?

108
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:43,619
It's an inflammation.

109
00:15:44,554 --> 00:15:46,857
Be patient. It takes months.

110
00:15:47,435 --> 00:15:50,501
Take this to the pharmacy.

111
00:15:51,595 --> 00:15:53,057
Thank you.

112
00:15:53,227 --> 00:15:54,536
Whose child is she?

113
00:15:56,684 --> 00:15:58,374
Nobody's.

114
00:16:42,222 --> 00:16:45,321
Theresa, I rarely ask anything of you…

115
00:16:45,486 --> 00:16:47,994
I only ask that you hear little Edith.

116
00:16:48,527 --> 00:16:51,691
Go on, Edith.
Speak to her. She'll listen.

117
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:53,099
Go ahead.

118
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:55,308
Theresa…

119
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,220
I don't want to be blind.
I want to see.

120
00:16:58,383 --> 00:16:59,812
She's all bruised.

121
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:01,031
Go on.

122
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,548
I want to learn to read,
and run like before.

123
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:06,183
I don't want to be blind.

124
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:10,117
Saint Theresa, tell baby Jesus
to look after Edith.

125
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:12,422
Go ahead.

126
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:15,272
Thank you, Saint Theresa and Jesus.

127
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,902
Thank you.

128
00:17:53,107 --> 00:17:55,212
You're home, Edith.

129
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:09,807
–Louise?
–Quickly…

130
00:18:10,228 --> 00:18:11,951
Come with me.

131
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,502
She can see…

132
00:19:20,984 --> 00:19:22,193
She can see!

133
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,983
Titine, get up!

134
00:19:33,145 --> 00:19:36,527
–What is it?
–He's back. He's taking Edith.

135
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:38,039
Get dressed.

136
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:40,438
They can't do that to me!

137
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:43,380
How can you go back to that job?

138
00:19:43,545 --> 00:19:45,301
She'll see the country.

139
00:19:45,465 --> 00:19:46,513
Go then.

140
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,719
Edith!

141
00:19:49,882 --> 00:19:51,409
Titine!

142
00:19:52,986 --> 00:19:54,808
Don't take my little girl!

143
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,912
Let her go!

144
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,963
Enough!

145
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,079
She's mad!

146
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,151
Stop it or you're out!

147
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:03,642
You have no right!

148
00:20:10,395 --> 00:20:11,890
Don't do this to me!

149
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:13,172
Go!

150
00:20:22,268 --> 00:20:23,446
I'll kill myself.

151
00:20:29,724 --> 00:20:31,176
We're at Orly airport.

152
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:32,308
Paris, Orly
June 1959

153
00:20:32,348 --> 00:20:35,124
Passengers are disembarking.
I see her. It's Edith Piaf!

154
00:20:35,164 --> 00:20:37,074
A young man's on her arm.

155
00:20:37,244 --> 00:20:39,220
What did you bring from America?

156
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,689
An American.

157
00:20:40,861 --> 00:20:42,388
What's his name?

158
00:20:42,557 --> 00:20:43,572
Edith, please!

159
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:49,087
Like her song,
she's “carried away by the crowd”…

160
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:52,345
She steps into her elegant
black and white car.

161
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:55,843
She looks tired, but is all smiles.

162
00:21:02,782 --> 00:21:04,887
Silence! I propose a toast…

163
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:07,454
What a slob!

164
00:21:07,614 --> 00:21:08,989
Slob yourself.

165
00:21:10,846 --> 00:21:12,373
Indulge the invalid.

166
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:17,207
Watch out, accordion man,
or you'll get a shiner!

167
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:20,601
Perfect timing!

168
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:24,084
Call the boss. I want free champagne!

169
00:21:24,256 --> 00:21:27,769
I'm Edith Piaf, and I made a mess.

170
00:21:28,127 --> 00:21:31,608
Everyone kiss. Even enemies!

171
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:33,599
Kiss me, Claude.

172
00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:44,060
–Who's that broad?
–No idea.

173
00:21:44,225 --> 00:21:46,007
Who gets the steak tartare?

174
00:21:46,113 --> 00:21:48,600
Where did your handsome friend go?

175
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:50,089
Don't embarrass her…

176
00:21:50,113 --> 00:21:53,015
Butt out, Coquatrix,
who rang your bell?

177
00:21:53,185 --> 00:21:55,323
Well… Mademoiselle!

178
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:58,905
Miss Piaf, a pleasure!
What can I do for you?

179
00:21:59,938 --> 00:22:02,110
A lot. I want a present.

180
00:22:02,626 --> 00:22:03,739
Naturally.

181
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,150
Well…

182
00:22:05,314 --> 00:22:08,348
I wanted champagne,
but I'll take a ring…

183
00:22:08,514 --> 00:22:11,776
a big ring with diamonds
studded everywhere.

184
00:22:11,938 --> 00:22:15,516
Don't trouble yourself,
we'll have champagne.

185
00:22:16,195 --> 00:22:19,231
Here's a toast
to the love I have for you all.

186
00:22:19,235 --> 00:22:21,275
And I'll stand up for that.

187
00:22:21,443 --> 00:22:23,166
Give me a hand.

188
00:22:26,851 --> 00:22:29,885
I'd like to make a toast to Marguerite.

189
00:22:31,844 --> 00:22:36,033
My composer and my most loyal friend
in the business.

190
00:22:37,124 --> 00:22:41,348
Don't blush like that,
you'll make us cry.

191
00:22:56,517 --> 00:22:57,969
You want an autograph?

192
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:00,187
I don't think so.

193
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,780
Bubbles and booze, perfect.
This is Claude's influence.

194
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,652
You're irritating, Loulou.

195
00:23:07,813 --> 00:23:10,912
We're just back to Paris,
we had some fun.

196
00:23:14,246 --> 00:23:16,622
Don't play the broken-hearted lover.

197
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,234
I'm waiting for someone. Get lost.

198
00:23:23,399 --> 00:23:25,951
Let me remind you,
you have commitments.

199
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:27,747
You're not alone.

200
00:23:27,911 --> 00:23:30,595
Remember the first night at Gerny's?

201
00:23:32,071 --> 00:23:35,748
I was a bum.
She looked at me like a princess.

202
00:23:35,911 --> 00:23:38,116
You were a princess. My princess!

203
00:23:38,824 --> 00:23:39,773
To Marguerite!

204
00:23:41,832 --> 00:23:44,736
To those who want
to see me fall on my face.

205
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:48,102
They think I don't notice! Cheers.

206
00:23:53,512 --> 00:23:55,030
Something wrong, Louis?

207
00:23:55,112 --> 00:23:57,502
He's having a tantrum.

208
00:23:57,673 --> 00:23:59,680
Get lost, we're busy.

209
00:25:28,142 --> 00:25:30,925
You don't watch the show. Get busy.

210
00:25:31,182 --> 00:25:34,346
You must work. There are no kids here.

211
00:25:34,703 --> 00:25:37,702
You have to earn your keep.
That's enough.

212
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,852
Little turd! You ruined my exit!

213
00:25:47,281 --> 00:25:49,327
Go to the trailer. Make dinner.

214
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,589
Ladies and gentlemen,
a big hand for Louis…

215
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:56,297
the contortionist!

216
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:40,270
She's so cute.

217
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:42,696
How old is she?

218
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,525
Ten.

219
00:26:45,459 --> 00:26:48,590
–Has she no mom, then?
–A mom? What for?

220
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:51,506
Don't you ever feel lonely?

221
00:26:52,852 --> 00:26:56,350
You could invite me back
to your trailer for a drink.

222
00:26:57,236 --> 00:26:58,643
All right, come on.

223
00:27:45,014 --> 00:27:46,444
Do you know who I am?

224
00:27:50,103 --> 00:27:52,014
I'm Theresa.

225
00:27:53,496 --> 00:27:55,765
Are your eyes well, my angel?

226
00:27:56,568 --> 00:27:57,844
Yes.

227
00:27:58,328 --> 00:28:02,703
You're so sweet.
Who'd you like to pray for?

228
00:28:03,864 --> 00:28:05,718
I'll pray for Titine.

229
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,623
Good girl. I'm watching over you.

230
00:28:09,784 --> 00:28:11,573
Never forget.

231
00:28:11,737 --> 00:28:14,966
When you're alone, I'll always be there.

232
00:28:31,162 --> 00:28:34,132
I've had it!
I told you to change that wheel.

233
00:28:34,202 --> 00:28:37,766
No discussions. Just help.
We're all in the same shit.

234
00:28:40,346 --> 00:28:42,788
–I don't give a damn!
–Then get lost!

235
00:28:46,395 --> 00:28:48,567
You can't quit. Not over a spat!

236
00:28:48,732 --> 00:28:52,277
Who needs a boss!
I can't stand Caroli anymore.

237
00:28:52,443 --> 00:28:54,647
–You're drunk!
–I'll go solo.

238
00:28:54,812 --> 00:28:57,716
Fat chance!
Circuses aren't on every corner.

239
00:28:57,755 --> 00:29:01,139
Don't worry. I always land on my feet.

240
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:05,528
–You were growing on me.
–You'll get over it!

241
00:29:10,492 --> 00:29:13,460
Saint Theresa,
make him change his mind.

242
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:16,018
I want to stay in the circus.

243
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,380
Edith!

244
00:31:10,212 --> 00:31:11,903
Is the girl in the act?

245
00:31:12,196 --> 00:31:13,571
Just a minute.

246
00:31:13,733 --> 00:31:15,293
Do something.

247
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,719
They'll leave, do something.

248
00:31:20,357 --> 00:31:23,391
Come on, do something.

249
00:32:17,065 --> 00:32:18,494
Bravo!

250
00:32:27,657 --> 00:32:28,911
That's my daughter!

251
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:44,963
I'm fed up with carrot juice.

252
00:32:45,066 --> 00:32:48,579
As long as I'm your nurse,
you'll have carrot juice.

253
00:32:52,202 --> 00:32:53,893
I prefer it dark, Simone.

254
00:32:54,058 --> 00:32:57,025
It's sunny, it'll do you good.

255
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,288
Edith…

256
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:10,401
I know it's hard…

257
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,540
you need lots and lots of rest…

258
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:15,879
and patience.

259
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:21,096
–Your husband called today—
–It's no use.

260
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:24,641
What makes me sick…

261
00:33:24,844 --> 00:33:27,081
is that I overdid it.

262
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:31,683
The last three years
have been disastrous.

263
00:33:32,461 --> 00:33:34,697
You're an artist.

264
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:38,662
Simone?

265
00:33:43,245 --> 00:33:46,824
I won't sing again, will I?

266
00:34:14,383 --> 00:34:16,424
What are you looking at?

267
00:34:16,592 --> 00:34:18,599
I want some chow.

268
00:34:46,321 --> 00:34:48,461
We sing for a bit, then we eat.

269
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:53,165
Singing alone's like begging.
With you, it's a show.

270
00:34:56,306 --> 00:34:58,029
I want to sing there.

271
00:35:08,563 --> 00:35:10,156
Hey, you!

272
00:35:10,738 --> 00:35:12,975
You can't sing in the street.

273
00:35:13,395 --> 00:35:14,572
Is that so?

274
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:16,681
–How old are you?
–Twenty.

275
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:18,607
What's that?

276
00:35:18,835 --> 00:35:21,291
She barely had a sip.

277
00:35:21,459 --> 00:35:22,921
Come here.

278
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:24,617
You know “Du Gris”?

279
00:35:25,844 --> 00:35:27,250
Shut your trap!

280
00:35:27,412 --> 00:35:29,389
If you sing it, I'll let you go.

281
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:32,974
My beat's over there.
I'll look the other way.

282
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:07,953
Next week's the 21 st.
Sisters for five years now.

283
00:36:09,462 --> 00:36:12,048
Prefer working with me or the factory?

284
00:36:12,983 --> 00:36:16,303
I'd rather slit my throat
than work in the factory.

285
00:36:16,343 --> 00:36:17,422
And you?

286
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,638
What about me?

287
00:36:18,807 --> 00:36:20,559
Slaving in a shitty cheese shop?

288
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:23,698
Shut up! We're eating.

289
00:36:23,863 --> 00:36:26,351
Annetta, don't make trouble.

290
00:36:27,032 --> 00:36:29,236
There's your lush of a mother.

291
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,309
Edith…

292
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,056
Any spare change?

293
00:36:48,281 --> 00:36:49,394
That's it?

294
00:36:49,562 --> 00:36:52,464
Yep, I'm no Rockefeller, as you know.

295
00:36:52,634 --> 00:36:55,251
–Give me bills.
–Don't have any.

296
00:36:57,817 --> 00:36:58,930
I'm your mother…

297
00:36:59,098 --> 00:37:00,625
Get lost!

298
00:37:02,586 --> 00:37:04,473
Want me to sing for it?

299
00:37:04,633 --> 00:37:06,128
Throw her out!

300
00:37:08,698 --> 00:37:11,481
I'm an artist! What are you?

301
00:37:11,643 --> 00:37:12,985
You'll see!

302
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,665
–You'll see!
–See what?

303
00:37:14,715 --> 00:37:16,984
When you're down and out!

304
00:37:17,147 --> 00:37:18,533
Pipe down or get out!

305
00:37:19,067 --> 00:37:20,496
A piece of shit!

306
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:22,325
Go to hell!

307
00:37:24,699 --> 00:37:27,961
Don't count on your daughter
feeding you!

308
00:37:28,124 --> 00:37:29,368
That's enough!

309
00:37:29,532 --> 00:37:32,216
I'm going. You can finish my plate.

310
00:37:32,379 --> 00:37:36,340
–You're no singer, you shit!
–Leave her be or I'll sock you!

311
00:37:37,564 --> 00:37:39,571
Let's lose these bums.

312
00:37:41,084 --> 00:37:42,393
Eat shit!

313
00:37:42,588 --> 00:37:46,331
Go on and sell yourself!

314
00:37:46,493 --> 00:37:49,859
Hurry, your ass will soon be
too old for customers.

315
00:38:39,648 --> 00:38:41,174
Thanks.

316
00:38:41,344 --> 00:38:43,456
You'll hurt your voice that way.

317
00:38:43,584 --> 00:38:45,853
I have to eat, sir.

318
00:38:46,017 --> 00:38:47,740
Of course you do.

319
00:38:47,905 --> 00:38:50,621
Here, my name's Louis Leplée.

320
00:38:50,785 --> 00:38:53,491
My card. Be at Gerny's
tomorrow at 2 p.m.

321
00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:55,450
We'll see what we can do with you.

322
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:56,667
You sing too?

323
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:59,070
No, but I have other talents.

324
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:01,950
Bring your sheet music…
Your usual songs.

325
00:39:04,353 --> 00:39:05,531
And if I don't?

326
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:10,049
Suit yourself, sweetheart.

327
00:39:30,595 --> 00:39:34,108
You're out all day
and this is what you bring back?

328
00:39:34,275 --> 00:39:36,447
I trust you and this is it?

329
00:39:36,964 --> 00:39:39,676
I keep some for my father.
He's sick and broke.

330
00:39:39,716 --> 00:39:41,504
I'm no social worker!

331
00:39:41,668 --> 00:39:43,162
I swear. He's sick.

332
00:39:45,795 --> 00:39:48,992
I'll throw you to the street,
then you'll see!

333
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:52,123
–Let her go!
–Never! Never!

334
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:54,536
I'd rather croak than turn tricks.

335
00:39:54,757 --> 00:39:57,692
–If she dies, it's on your head!
–Shut up!

336
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,404
I want more, understand?

337
00:40:01,573 --> 00:40:04,606
Or you'll spread your legs like the rest!

338
00:40:04,773 --> 00:40:06,489
You'll spread yours first.

339
00:40:15,014 --> 00:40:18,080
Albert, I'm sorry…

340
00:40:18,565 --> 00:40:20,541
Stay, please stay!

341
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,271
Drop that asshole.

342
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,695
Etienne, give her a drink.

343
00:40:31,206 --> 00:40:33,695
–Coming to the Chinaman's?
–Who's going?

344
00:40:33,735 --> 00:40:35,742
The two wops, Fats and Pops.

345
00:40:36,488 --> 00:40:38,798
There'll be lots of coke and poppy.

346
00:40:38,951 --> 00:40:41,090
How about some human warmth…

347
00:40:41,255 --> 00:40:43,557
Because I screwed you once…

348
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,793
doesn't mean I'll do it again.

349
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,294
–Get it?
–Give me a break.

350
00:40:48,456 --> 00:40:50,016
You know what?

351
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:53,599
I don't give a shit
about all that, know why?

352
00:40:53,769 --> 00:40:56,005
No? Too dense?

353
00:40:56,168 --> 00:40:58,885
Because I'm an artiste.

354
00:40:59,048 --> 00:41:01,284
I'm going to the top! I know it.

355
00:41:01,448 --> 00:41:03,359
I've always known it!

356
00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:08,035
It's the little flame.

357
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:12,357
Saint Theresa, I see great things.

358
00:41:18,474 --> 00:41:22,086
Look at her clothes. She looks sick.

359
00:41:22,666 --> 00:41:24,250
Where did he dig her up?

360
00:41:40,907 --> 00:41:42,696
She's incredible.

361
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,297
Philipo, champagne.

362
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:47,172
The boss is in love.

363
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,966
She's got lung power.

364
00:41:54,092 --> 00:41:56,072
The kid's all right, my Louis.

365
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:58,344
Don't be jealous, Josette.

366
00:42:25,997 --> 00:42:27,398
Tell me your name again.

367
00:42:27,438 --> 00:42:29,380
Edith Giovanna Gassion.

368
00:42:30,446 --> 00:42:31,526
That's not great.

369
00:42:31,566 --> 00:42:33,508
I have other names:

370
00:42:33,678 --> 00:42:36,548
Huguette Helias, Tania…

371
00:42:37,775 --> 00:42:39,880
–Denise Jay.
–Jay…

372
00:42:40,046 --> 00:42:41,802
You get manicures!

373
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,239
Don't change the subject.

374
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:47,622
You're like a bird.

375
00:42:48,207 --> 00:42:49,549
You think so?

376
00:42:49,711 --> 00:42:50,791
Really?

377
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:52,680
Is “Little Songbird” taken?

378
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,127
Yes, it's taken.

379
00:42:55,088 --> 00:42:56,714
A sparrow…

380
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,400
You call a sparrow a piaf?

381
00:42:59,696 --> 00:43:02,031
Is that what you say? Piaf?

382
00:43:03,696 --> 00:43:05,965
–The Little Sparrow.
–Great!

383
00:43:06,129 --> 00:43:09,161
–That's corny.
–What do you know?

384
00:43:09,329 --> 00:43:12,012
–The Little Sparrow.
–That's great!

385
00:43:12,177 --> 00:43:15,144
You need some classics
worthy of your name.

386
00:43:15,312 --> 00:43:17,290
Bruant's “Les Mômes de la Cloche.”

387
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:18,638
I know that one.

388
00:43:18,801 --> 00:43:21,451
Rehearse around the clock if need be.

389
00:43:22,226 --> 00:43:24,014
You start on Friday.

390
00:43:26,546 --> 00:43:28,262
The show's about to begin.

391
00:43:28,402 --> 00:43:29,771
Check on your protégée.

392
00:43:29,811 --> 00:43:31,725
–Why?
–She's quite a drinker.

393
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:33,257
I'm on my way.

394
00:43:35,698 --> 00:43:36,680
Philipo…

395
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,890
no more alcohol backstage.

396
00:43:45,363 --> 00:43:46,770
What are you doing?

397
00:43:46,931 --> 00:43:49,168
I didn't finish knitting it.

398
00:43:49,331 --> 00:43:51,600
–I'm making a sleeve.
–Now!

399
00:43:51,764 --> 00:43:53,995
–It's sold out.
–All the more reason.

400
00:43:54,035 --> 00:43:56,010
She can't go on like a bum!

401
00:43:56,179 --> 00:44:00,684
She can't sing looking like a bum.
Your star is dressing your new singer.

402
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:02,066
Yes, absolutely.

403
00:44:02,228 --> 00:44:04,170
–Girls, hurry.
–Yes.

404
00:44:04,339 --> 00:44:06,162
I'm gonna barf.

405
00:44:06,324 --> 00:44:08,877
Some other time. Quickly, now.

406
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,887
A few days ago, on my way home…

407
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:20,276
perhaps luck or fate led me
to tonight's performer.

408
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:23,027
Here she is, as I first saw her…

409
00:44:23,189 --> 00:44:25,328
a diamond in the rough.

410
00:44:25,494 --> 00:44:29,268
From the sidewalk to Gerny's:
The Little Sparrow.

411
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:56,474
She's like my sister.

412
00:46:16,124 --> 00:46:17,433
Did I lie?

413
00:46:17,596 --> 00:46:19,603
She's sensational.

414
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:10,235
Meet the venerable Jean Mermoz.

415
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:13,494
This is for you.

416
00:47:14,367 --> 00:47:15,677
Thank you.

417
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,301
Come, Edith.

418
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,433
You wowed them, you'll do it
tomorrow and every night.

419
00:47:21,473 --> 00:47:24,254
You must meet someone
who'll help you.

420
00:47:28,896 --> 00:47:31,766
My name's Marguerite Monnot.
I'm a pianist.

421
00:47:31,937 --> 00:47:35,134
If ever you need,
I'd love to compose for you.

422
00:47:35,425 --> 00:47:36,440
Thank you.

423
00:47:36,609 --> 00:47:37,983
Come.

424
00:47:38,337 --> 00:47:39,417
Edith…

425
00:47:39,585 --> 00:47:41,756
this is Mr Jacques Canetti.

426
00:47:41,922 --> 00:47:43,993
Artistic Director of City Radio.

427
00:47:44,033 --> 00:47:46,685
Miss, you completely dazzled me.

428
00:47:47,106 --> 00:47:48,186
Thank you.

429
00:47:48,354 --> 00:47:50,264
Please join us at our table.

430
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:53,915
–I can't stay. I have to run.
–What's so important?

431
00:47:56,258 --> 00:47:57,403
Thank you.

432
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:58,552
What is it?

433
00:47:58,946 --> 00:48:00,889
Marvelous, marvelous.

434
00:48:08,899 --> 00:48:11,011
You better lay off, or it's pow…

435
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,962
right in the kisser!

436
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:15,993
You dimwit,
we've been waiting an hour!

437
00:48:16,164 --> 00:48:18,466
Fuck off, you stingy bastard!

438
00:48:37,892 --> 00:48:39,387
THE SPARROW

439
00:48:39,557 --> 00:48:42,111
RECORD OF THE MONTH

440
00:48:42,278 --> 00:48:45,060
AT GERNY'S
ASTOUNDING

441
00:48:48,902 --> 00:48:51,456
Interview with Louis Leplée

442
00:48:51,622 --> 00:48:54,942
Leplée introduces Edith Gassion,
a.k.a “The Sparrow”

443
00:48:54,982 --> 00:48:57,358
Owner of famous cabaret
“Le Gerny's”

444
00:49:13,927 --> 00:49:14,908
Miss…

445
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,869
you're marvelous.

446
00:49:17,799 --> 00:49:20,451
My hand's going to fall off.

447
00:49:20,615 --> 00:49:21,990
Have more bubbly.

448
00:49:22,152 --> 00:49:24,127
I want the bottle!

449
00:49:24,616 --> 00:49:27,038
Here. I told her to trust me.

450
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:29,888
That's the power of radio,
right, Coquatrix?

451
00:49:29,928 --> 00:49:32,370
Don't forget the magic of music hall.

452
00:49:32,393 --> 00:49:33,341
Of course.

453
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,880
Edith, I have something for you.

454
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:37,797
–A song?
–Naturally.

455
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,524
Raymond! Raymond!

456
00:49:40,297 --> 00:49:42,206
Mireille, call Raymond.

457
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,183
Someone for you, Kid.

458
00:49:45,353 --> 00:49:47,742
Someone for you, Kid.

459
00:49:51,049 --> 00:49:53,227
The big guy wants to talk to you.

460
00:49:54,281 --> 00:49:56,616
This is Raymond Asso…

461
00:49:56,777 --> 00:50:00,094
writer, composer, performer, poet.

462
00:50:01,066 --> 00:50:03,881
–I'll be back.
–I love your music.

463
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:07,360
Yeah, I don't like your mug.

464
00:50:12,299 --> 00:50:14,470
I've seen you often.

465
00:50:15,308 --> 00:50:16,892
You must've been hiding.

466
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,322
It's midnight, everyone up.

467
00:50:20,491 --> 00:50:21,920
Everyone stand up!

468
00:50:38,989 --> 00:50:40,843
You're an immense artist.

469
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:43,077
I'm wearing high heels.

470
00:50:48,493 --> 00:50:50,119
Whenever you'd like…

471
00:50:50,285 --> 00:50:52,107
Call me. I'll be waiting.

472
00:51:11,727 --> 00:51:13,963
My Daddy Leplée!

473
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:17,988
A toast to my Daddy Leplée,
my savior!

474
00:52:27,636 --> 00:52:31,149
What about yesterday?
Were you in, or…

475
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,361
I was here, but didn't see him.

476
00:53:11,094 --> 00:53:13,942
You're a bird of ill omen!

477
00:53:18,935 --> 00:53:20,877
It's her fault!

478
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,262
Are you the Little Sparrow?

479
00:53:31,383 --> 00:53:33,357
Follow me, please.

480
00:53:33,528 --> 00:53:34,640
What for?

481
00:53:34,807 --> 00:53:36,530
This way.

482
00:53:36,696 --> 00:53:38,768
Let me through, please.

483
00:53:38,936 --> 00:53:39,984
This way.

484
00:53:41,303 --> 00:53:42,798
I'm talking to you!

485
00:53:42,968 --> 00:53:45,423
–Are you mixed up with the Mob?
–No.

486
00:53:47,096 --> 00:53:48,176
Leave me alone.

487
00:53:48,345 --> 00:53:49,995
What about Henri Valette?

488
00:53:50,072 --> 00:53:52,855
And Georges,
Johnny the sailor and Albert…

489
00:53:53,017 --> 00:53:54,672
never heard of them either?

490
00:53:54,712 --> 00:53:57,748
They're friends.
They're not mixed up in this.

491
00:53:58,137 --> 00:54:00,658
Aiding and abetting is a crime.

492
00:54:00,826 --> 00:54:03,859
I'm not guilty! I didn't do anything!

493
00:54:04,025 --> 00:54:05,411
I've lost everything.

494
00:54:05,529 --> 00:54:07,090
Where were you last night?

495
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:10,229
I told you, I was out partying…

496
00:54:11,546 --> 00:54:13,455
You scum, lousy rats!

497
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:15,738
What you're doing is disgusting!

498
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:17,459
This isn't the stage!

499
00:54:17,627 --> 00:54:21,401
It seems you have
some unsavory friends, like Albert.

500
00:54:21,562 --> 00:54:24,083
I don't know any of them, inspector.

501
00:54:24,251 --> 00:54:26,231
Sure. I wasn't born yesterday.

502
00:54:28,635 --> 00:54:30,963
–Miss Piaf, a word?
–A photo, please.

503
00:54:31,003 --> 00:54:33,370
She deserves to be shamed!

504
00:54:33,531 --> 00:54:36,019
You just go back to the gutter
you came from!

505
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:38,131
Leave her alone! She's innocent.

506
00:54:38,171 --> 00:54:39,732
Got that?

507
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,418
Did you turn anyone in?

508
00:54:41,532 --> 00:54:44,106
This is a funeral. Show some restraint.

509
00:54:47,804 --> 00:54:51,481
–One more question.
–Stop stirring shit. Move!

510
00:54:52,028 --> 00:54:53,747
Out of the way, all of you!

511
00:54:53,787 --> 00:54:55,833
That's it. I'm as good as dead.

512
00:54:56,093 --> 00:54:59,060
They dragged me through the mud.

513
00:55:00,124 --> 00:55:02,264
Forget it. It's old news.

514
00:55:02,653 --> 00:55:04,278
I didn't do anything!

515
00:55:04,444 --> 00:55:05,393
I know.

516
00:55:08,158 --> 00:55:09,751
Open up.

517
00:55:18,142 --> 00:55:20,313
–What?
–Simone Berteaut?

518
00:55:21,438 --> 00:55:22,518
Yes.

519
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:25,850
Miss Berteaut, you must come with us.

520
00:55:26,174 --> 00:55:27,930
What for?

521
00:55:28,094 --> 00:55:31,063
Court order from the judge
and your mother to send you…

522
00:55:31,103 --> 00:55:33,175
to a girls' detention home.

523
00:55:33,344 --> 00:55:35,864
Effective immediately.

524
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:37,689
Get your things, please.

525
00:55:37,854 --> 00:55:39,895
It's not true. She stays here!

526
00:55:40,064 --> 00:55:42,267
I have nothing to say to you.

527
00:55:42,912 --> 00:55:45,693
For the last time, get your things.

528
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:49,374
You want to kill me!

529
00:55:49,536 --> 00:55:51,648
You want to kill me, is that it?

530
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,553
Let me go, I said.

531
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:56,061
She's not leaving.

532
00:55:56,224 --> 00:55:59,934
–Momone!
–Edith, don't let them take me!

533
00:56:01,793 --> 00:56:03,833
My things! I have nothing!

534
00:56:04,001 --> 00:56:06,106
You hear, you bastard?

535
00:56:06,272 --> 00:56:09,819
Momone, no!

536
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:20,032
Daddy Leplée.

537
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:25,952
Oh, Daddy Leplée!

538
00:56:34,435 --> 00:56:36,890
You killed him! Where's the dough?

539
00:56:39,235 --> 00:56:42,050
What do you expect from a former slut?

540
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:24,990
Everyone out of my dressing room!

541
00:57:25,158 --> 00:57:26,947
Mamie, stay.

542
00:57:33,223 --> 00:57:36,321
I need a shot, it hurts too bad.

543
00:58:01,512 --> 00:58:03,683
Call the American.

544
00:58:08,041 --> 00:58:10,495
You can come in now.

545
00:58:15,113 --> 00:58:17,350
What a triumph. It was divine.

546
00:58:17,514 --> 00:58:18,975
Doug…

547
00:58:21,257 --> 00:58:22,817
I need some air.

548
00:58:22,985 --> 00:58:26,247
I want to go back to Chalons, with you.

549
00:58:29,097 --> 00:58:31,341
It's four hundred kilometers away.

550
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:34,400
Go to hell, all of you!

551
00:58:34,571 --> 00:58:36,221
I've had it with you all!

552
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:39,177
You're exhausted. It's a long journey.

553
00:58:39,339 --> 00:58:43,016
It's always “no” this and ”no” that.
To hell with that!

554
00:59:01,131 --> 00:59:02,440
Let's go back.

555
00:59:02,603 --> 00:59:04,709
Turn around.

556
00:59:04,876 --> 00:59:08,105
Turn around! You spoiled it for me!

557
00:59:21,965 --> 00:59:24,005
Her blood tests are catastrophic.

558
00:59:24,045 --> 00:59:26,487
She has two broken ribs we can't set.

559
00:59:26,509 --> 00:59:28,298
It'll take weeks.

560
00:59:28,461 --> 00:59:32,716
If she has engagements, cancel them.

561
00:59:41,102 --> 00:59:43,306
It's tight enough. Get away.

562
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:46,380
Doctor, give me a shot so I can sing.

563
00:59:46,543 --> 00:59:49,642
Sorry, but my admiration has limits.

564
00:59:50,383 --> 00:59:53,001
Theirs has no limits, neither do I.

565
00:59:53,167 --> 00:59:55,851
Cancel. You're playing with your life.

566
00:59:56,015 --> 00:59:59,397
So? You have to play with something.

567
00:59:59,567 --> 01:00:02,633
You want a new life? Get a new you.

568
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,099
–New what?
–New you.

569
01:00:06,128 --> 01:00:07,983
Why didn't you call sooner?

570
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:12,138
I was busy. I didn't know
what you wanted with me.

571
01:00:12,305 --> 01:00:15,600
I saw you sing. You've a lot to learn.

572
01:00:16,016 --> 01:00:18,252
You're the first to say so.

573
01:00:18,512 --> 01:00:22,604
In three months no one will call
you Kid. Cabaret life's over.

574
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:33,232
Like-a-storm-in-the-night! Articulate!

575
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:34,864
Again!

576
01:00:38,162 --> 01:00:41,261
“He had bright blue eyes”!

577
01:00:41,425 --> 01:00:43,084
Are they words or sounds?

578
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:45,933
–What do you want?
–Perfect diction!

579
01:00:46,098 --> 01:00:48,040
I sing the way I speak!

580
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:49,737
Badly.

581
01:00:50,034 --> 01:00:54,126
You slur the words,
and you don't understand them.

582
01:00:56,051 --> 01:00:57,305
Slower, Marguerite.

583
01:00:57,394 --> 01:00:59,660
It's been 6 hours.
Can we open a window?

584
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,522
We'll breathe later.

585
01:01:02,259 --> 01:01:03,568
Again.

586
01:01:11,187 --> 01:01:14,733
You don't listen!
You're not living the song.

587
01:01:15,829 --> 01:01:19,178
You have to be that woman in love.

588
01:01:19,796 --> 01:01:21,739
Think like an actress.

589
01:01:25,013 --> 01:01:26,354
He's mocking me.

590
01:01:26,517 --> 01:01:29,418
We're tired. We need a break.

591
01:01:31,286 --> 01:01:33,740
He makes me feel like I can't sing.

592
01:01:33,909 --> 01:01:36,277
Who do you think you are?

593
01:01:36,981 --> 01:01:39,535
You can't rest on your laurels.

594
01:01:40,053 --> 01:01:42,225
I started singing at 9!

595
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:46,132
It's okay. Don't worry.
This is new and difficult.

596
01:01:46,517 --> 01:01:49,157
You must become a performer,
understand?

597
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:51,340
Live the song!

598
01:01:52,086 --> 01:01:54,475
No one ever minded my diction.

599
01:01:54,646 --> 01:01:57,679
No one… Like who?

600
01:01:57,943 --> 01:02:00,877
Creeps at Gerny's or on the street?

601
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:12,048
Do what I say or go back to the gutter.

602
01:02:18,136 --> 01:02:19,696
Edith!

603
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:29,940
To my little girl
who never forgot her daddy.

604
01:02:30,105 --> 01:02:32,047
–To the Kid!
–To the Kid!

605
01:02:32,217 --> 01:02:35,055
Heard you got a mentor.
Does he have bucks?

606
01:02:35,257 --> 01:02:37,647
Not a cent… It's art for art's sake.

607
01:02:37,817 --> 01:02:40,053
Art for your ass' sake.

608
01:02:40,217 --> 01:02:42,422
Come on, Kid, sing something.

609
01:02:42,586 --> 01:02:44,691
Give us a song!

610
01:03:34,653 --> 01:03:37,107
That's the way to handle her.

611
01:03:37,565 --> 01:03:39,704
I let her get away.

612
01:03:41,149 --> 01:03:43,638
I was too good to her!

613
01:04:08,063 --> 01:04:10,932
You're stiff as a poker. Lifeless.

614
01:04:11,103 --> 01:04:13,431
Like a champ brawling in the street.

615
01:04:13,471 --> 01:04:15,381
Performing is an art.

616
01:04:15,968 --> 01:04:18,521
Grab them with all you've got.

617
01:04:19,007 --> 01:04:20,829
You have great hands.

618
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,366
Use them.

619
01:04:22,528 --> 01:04:23,870
Sing with them.

620
01:04:24,032 --> 01:04:25,592
Again, Marguerite.

621
01:04:30,144 --> 01:04:31,737
Put some life in it.

622
01:04:33,472 --> 01:04:34,990
Your hands, your hands.

623
01:04:38,528 --> 01:04:39,837
That's it.

624
01:04:41,986 --> 01:04:44,254
–I feel stupid.
–Keep going.

625
01:04:54,081 --> 01:04:55,575
Put this on.

626
01:04:56,418 --> 01:04:59,898
People don't care about that.
They like my voice.

627
01:05:00,066 --> 01:05:03,579
How can you be so talented
and so pig-headed?

628
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:31,457
–Open up.
–I'm going to throw up!

629
01:05:31,619 --> 01:05:33,203
What's up, is she drunk?

630
01:05:33,283 --> 01:05:34,974
No, she's panicking.

631
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:38,969
The audience is waiting!

632
01:05:41,508 --> 01:05:43,517
For weeks you bugged me
for this show.

633
01:05:43,557 --> 01:05:47,386
Get her on stage before there's a riot!

634
01:05:47,557 --> 01:05:49,117
She's coming.

635
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:51,097
Edith…

636
01:05:51,589 --> 01:05:53,313
You have three minutes.

637
01:05:53,477 --> 01:05:56,990
This isn't a cabaret, it's a music hall.

638
01:05:57,157 --> 01:05:59,525
What have I gotten myself into?

639
01:06:00,294 --> 01:06:03,774
It's stage fright. It's a good sign.

640
01:06:08,453 --> 01:06:09,915
Edith?

641
01:06:10,759 --> 01:06:12,166
What?

642
01:06:13,735 --> 01:06:14,979
This is it.

643
01:06:15,143 --> 01:06:17,346
This is what we've worked for.

644
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:19,682
You can't crack up now.

645
01:06:21,991 --> 01:06:23,399
Open this door.

646
01:06:24,775 --> 01:06:27,230
No, I can't.

647
01:06:28,999 --> 01:06:30,789
Open it, please.

648
01:06:34,344 --> 01:06:35,806
Stand up.

649
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:21,192
Ladies and gentlemen, Edith Piaf!

650
01:09:29,203 --> 01:09:30,894
EDITH PIAF
triumphs!

651
01:09:31,059 --> 01:09:32,946
STREET SINGER
MAKES IT BIG

652
01:09:33,492 --> 01:09:35,340
THE LITTLE SPARROW
Premieres

653
01:09:37,779 --> 01:09:40,023
“The first Man to give me a hand…”

654
01:09:42,355 --> 01:09:43,370
PIAF
ON TOUR

655
01:09:49,428 --> 01:09:51,936
EDITH PIAF's tour
at the A.B.C Theater

656
01:10:06,901 --> 01:10:09,607
The Sparrow's Dead.
Long Live Edith Piaf!

657
01:10:24,246 --> 01:10:26,490
Know what it's like to hurry home…

658
01:10:26,518 --> 01:10:28,828
hoping to lean on the one you love…

659
01:10:28,951 --> 01:10:30,838
only to find an empty room.

660
01:10:30,999 --> 01:10:32,690
Waiting and waiting.

661
01:10:32,855 --> 01:10:35,099
I know that empty room. Yes, I do.

662
01:10:35,127 --> 01:10:36,943
I can't wait to see you in the play.

663
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:38,062
Paris, February 14, 1940

664
01:10:38,102 --> 01:10:39,535
Heads up, Canetti's coming.

665
01:10:39,575 --> 01:10:42,892
The conductor has been
waiting three hours.

666
01:10:43,064 --> 01:10:46,064
–So?
–The premiere's in less than 48 hours.

667
01:10:46,232 --> 01:10:49,777
Know many people
Cocteau has written plays for?

668
01:10:50,552 --> 01:10:52,243
–Miss?
–Yes, Suzanne.

669
01:10:52,408 --> 01:10:56,368
Paul Meurisse called.
Dinner with Mr Cocteau is at 8:00 p.m.

670
01:10:56,408 --> 01:10:57,969
You see.

671
01:10:58,136 --> 01:11:00,176
Ask him to come back at midnight.

672
01:11:00,216 --> 01:11:01,460
Are you sure?

673
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:04,690
You're worse than Raymond.
Do this, do that.

674
01:11:04,856 --> 01:11:07,248
–Stop it.
–She fired that pain in the ass!

675
01:11:07,288 --> 01:11:08,401
Stop it.

676
01:11:08,569 --> 01:11:10,351
Shall I show you the gowns?

677
01:11:10,457 --> 01:11:12,050
Yes, the gowns.

678
01:11:19,386 --> 01:11:22,036
They're all here, Miss Piaf.

679
01:11:22,201 --> 01:11:24,089
Careful of the pins.

680
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:26,901
The simplest one, no collar.

681
01:11:29,977 --> 01:11:33,079
A man's been calling…
He has something for you.

682
01:11:33,114 --> 01:11:34,962
–What's he like?
–A soldier.

683
01:11:35,067 --> 01:11:39,474
I said you couldn't see him.
He's on the landing. It's awkward.

684
01:11:39,643 --> 01:11:42,010
Since he's here, show him in.

685
01:11:49,756 --> 01:11:51,282
Follow me.

686
01:11:52,956 --> 01:11:53,939
Put it there.

687
01:11:58,396 --> 01:12:02,171
–Here she is.
–Much better with no collar.

688
01:12:02,748 --> 01:12:04,275
Well…

689
01:12:04,444 --> 01:12:07,128
My name's Michel Emer,
I'm a corporal.

690
01:12:07,293 --> 01:12:10,489
This isn't the army.
What do you want?

691
01:12:13,725 --> 01:12:15,177
I have a song for you.

692
01:12:15,261 --> 01:12:17,628
Another? I have plenty.

693
01:12:17,789 --> 01:12:20,149
I premiere at the Bobino in two days.

694
01:12:20,189 --> 01:12:21,597
I'll take this one.

695
01:12:21,758 --> 01:12:23,930
I go to the front tomorrow.

696
01:12:27,646 --> 01:12:30,352
There's the piano.
You have five minutes.

697
01:12:34,749 --> 01:12:36,342
Edith…

698
01:12:38,879 --> 01:12:40,788
We'll have to wait.

699
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,521
Stop.

700
01:13:20,288 --> 01:13:21,914
I want it.

701
01:13:22,082 --> 01:13:23,455
Everybody out.

702
01:13:25,410 --> 01:13:28,159
You can't do this. We're already late.

703
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:29,783
What can't she do?

704
01:13:29,954 --> 01:13:32,823
Play it. I want it for the Bobino.

705
01:13:32,994 --> 01:13:34,401
Get moving.

706
01:13:36,323 --> 01:13:39,355
–You can't do this.
–I can't?

707
01:13:39,523 --> 01:13:42,305
Then what's the point
of being Edith Piaf?

708
01:13:49,859 --> 01:13:51,201
In French, please.

709
01:13:51,363 --> 01:13:53,981
“She's too desperate, too poor…”

710
01:13:54,147 --> 01:13:55,641
Spit it out, Charles.

711
01:13:55,811 --> 01:13:57,197
I'm not a translator.

712
01:13:58,051 --> 01:14:03,715
“Pathetic. Not in the tradition
of the French Cancan and Gay Paris.

713
01:14:03,876 --> 01:14:05,218
A complete flop.”

714
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:08,926
It's not the first time
you've had to fight.

715
01:14:09,091 --> 01:14:12,353
Americans want beauties, not me.

716
01:14:12,517 --> 01:14:15,487
I'm not the Parisian
bombshell they expected.

717
01:14:15,492 --> 01:14:17,533
Can you see me as a chorus girl?

718
01:14:17,573 --> 01:14:20,443
Where's my feather up the ass!

719
01:14:27,141 --> 01:14:29,649
Go on, laugh. I don't connect to them.

720
01:14:29,797 --> 01:14:31,837
They think I'm sad, they're dumb.

721
01:14:31,877 --> 01:14:33,438
Yeah, too dumb.

722
01:14:42,341 --> 01:14:44,981
–You're on the front page.
–Two columns.

723
01:15:00,327 --> 01:15:02,835
It's Greek to me, translate this shit.

724
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:06,213
He says they shouldn't let you go.

725
01:15:06,376 --> 01:15:08,383
It would be a grave mistake.

726
01:15:08,552 --> 01:15:11,868
The Americans don't deserve you.

727
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:15,340
I knew something would happen!
I must get changed.

728
01:15:15,368 --> 01:15:17,638
Ginou, help me choose a dress.

729
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:22,536
Tonight I'm going out. I have a date.

730
01:15:35,977 --> 01:15:37,121
What's this, Marcel?

731
01:15:37,161 --> 01:15:38,949
Beef… Go on, taste it.

732
01:15:41,898 --> 01:15:43,720
It smells like a wet dog.

733
01:15:47,403 --> 01:15:48,351
What?

734
01:15:54,698 --> 01:15:57,074
Your English is as good as the meat.

735
01:16:04,171 --> 01:16:06,027
Don't like the place?

736
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:09,316
I'm a bit surprised. I didn't expect…

737
01:16:10,379 --> 01:16:13,151
When you called
to invite me out and said…

738
01:16:13,195 --> 01:16:15,268
we were two Frenchies
alone in New York…

739
01:16:15,308 --> 01:16:17,894
why not go out to eat…

740
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:20,106
I imagined something different.

741
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:22,194
It's my local spot.

742
01:16:25,996 --> 01:16:28,452
You sure know how to spoil a girl.

743
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:45,859
–Two pastrami sandwiches…
–Oh, no!

744
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:48,846
I'll handle this.
Two tournedos Rossini…

745
01:16:49,326 --> 01:16:53,767
and a bottle of Château
Angélus 1938, please.

746
01:16:57,647 --> 01:16:59,033
You must be starving.

747
01:16:59,663 --> 01:17:01,841
Better that than boiled dog meat.

748
01:17:02,895 --> 01:17:04,236
I'm sorry.

749
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,759
Let's start over. Okay?

750
01:17:09,072 --> 01:17:11,382
How long have you been in New York?

751
01:17:11,887 --> 01:17:13,611
Eight weeks.

752
01:17:13,775 --> 01:17:15,095
Do you like America?

753
01:17:16,047 --> 01:17:18,087
I couldn't care less about America.

754
01:17:18,127 --> 01:17:20,767
I don't get them,
and they don't get me.

755
01:17:20,784 --> 01:17:23,086
–You must miss Paris.
–Terribly.

756
01:17:23,248 --> 01:17:25,834
What do you do
when you're not singing?

757
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:30,438
You could be a police investigator.

758
01:17:30,608 --> 01:17:31,754
I knit.

759
01:17:32,528 --> 01:17:35,366
Tell me your size,
I'll knit you a sweater.

760
01:17:35,473 --> 01:17:37,645
No, thanks, really…

761
01:17:39,569 --> 01:17:41,511
Those people recognized you.

762
01:17:41,681 --> 01:17:42,958
Really?

763
01:17:45,457 --> 01:17:50,247
They're saying that chump lost
his last two fights. He's washed up.

764
01:17:50,418 --> 01:17:53,199
–I'll shut them up good.
–No!

765
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:56,745
Don't get worked up. I was kidding.

766
01:18:08,402 --> 01:18:09,832
Very good.

767
01:18:20,084 --> 01:18:21,602
Let's not be so formal.

768
01:18:21,684 --> 01:18:23,178
Of course…

769
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,489
And when you're not boxing?

770
01:18:25,652 --> 01:18:27,561
I train, I run…

771
01:18:27,732 --> 01:18:28,986
And after training?

772
01:18:29,012 --> 01:18:32,328
When I'm home in Morocco,
I work on my farm.

773
01:18:33,012 --> 01:18:34,922
You have a farm!

774
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:37,168
I raise pigs.

775
01:18:41,813 --> 01:18:43,918
What? Why not?

776
01:18:46,998 --> 01:18:48,460
It's true, why not?

777
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:52,128
It's a lovely farm.
Very modern, with fine, fat pigs.

778
01:18:52,213 --> 01:18:53,774
Who works it when you box?

779
01:18:53,814 --> 01:18:55,189
My wife.

780
01:19:03,222 --> 01:19:04,651
You have…

781
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:07,189
magnificent hands.

782
01:19:09,623 --> 01:19:11,339
Did you hear that, Momone?

783
01:19:11,479 --> 01:19:13,683
You do have nice fingers.

784
01:19:15,288 --> 01:19:16,661
Listen.

785
01:19:16,823 --> 01:19:18,765
What color are your eyes?

786
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:21,729
He leaned over to have a closer look.

787
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:23,266
And his breath stunk!

788
01:19:23,416 --> 01:19:24,848
You can be such a jerk.

789
01:19:24,888 --> 01:19:26,868
He is a pig farmer, after all.

790
01:19:26,904 --> 01:19:27,919
He said…

791
01:19:28,088 --> 01:19:29,779
Violet blue.

792
01:19:29,945 --> 01:19:31,919
Of course, violet blue.

793
01:19:32,088 --> 01:19:34,062
It was the way he said it.

794
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:36,335
He seemed like a child.

795
01:19:37,593 --> 01:19:39,218
Then he said…

796
01:19:39,385 --> 01:19:41,174
You look like a fairy.

797
01:19:42,265 --> 01:19:44,567
That's a bit much.

798
01:20:12,443 --> 01:20:13,785
Did you kiss him?

799
01:20:14,363 --> 01:20:16,054
I didn't dare.

800
01:20:17,211 --> 01:20:20,245
–It was a very lovely evening.
–Too short.

801
01:20:22,875 --> 01:20:24,763
Will you watch me fight?

802
01:20:24,924 --> 01:20:26,866
Of course.

803
01:20:28,604 --> 01:20:30,993
Did he try to kiss you?

804
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:33,689
Don't know if it crossed his mind.

805
01:20:34,492 --> 01:20:36,084
Yeah, sure. I believe that.

806
01:20:36,124 --> 01:20:37,708
I'll come hear you sing.

807
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:43,763
Well… Good night.

808
01:20:47,901 --> 01:20:49,789
He's the love of my life!

809
01:22:19,426 --> 01:22:21,532
You were wonderful!

810
01:22:21,698 --> 01:22:25,888
Mr Lucien Roupp,
who is Mr Cerdan's manager.

811
01:22:26,051 --> 01:22:27,425
Mr Jameson…

812
01:22:27,587 --> 01:22:29,595
from CBS television network…

813
01:22:44,036 --> 01:22:45,596
Marlene…

814
01:22:48,421 --> 01:22:52,643
Good evening. I'm sorry.
I simply wanted to have a word.

815
01:22:54,917 --> 01:22:57,699
I haven't been to Paris for ages.

816
01:22:57,989 --> 01:23:01,404
But this evening,
when you were singing, Edith…

817
01:23:01,573 --> 01:23:03,427
I was there…

818
01:23:03,717 --> 01:23:06,106
in the streets, beneath its sky.

819
01:23:06,406 --> 01:23:10,017
Your voice is the soul of Paris.

820
01:23:10,182 --> 01:23:12,254
You took me on a journey.

821
01:23:12,422 --> 01:23:14,309
You made me cry.

822
01:23:15,462 --> 01:23:18,036
Thank you,
from the bottom of my heart.

823
01:23:18,566 --> 01:23:20,127
Thank you.

824
01:23:56,777 --> 01:23:58,151
Come on up.

825
01:24:04,361 --> 01:24:06,663
I'm starting to like this city.

826
01:24:06,857 --> 01:24:09,159
The stars are out tonight.

827
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:10,854
Let's go.

828
01:24:25,741 --> 01:24:26,820
Marc…

829
01:24:26,988 --> 01:24:29,378
do you know how long a frog lives?

830
01:24:30,797 --> 01:24:32,652
In fairy tales or in life?

831
01:24:35,213 --> 01:24:39,108
I've never read fairy tales…
To anyone.

832
01:24:39,341 --> 01:24:41,480
You haven't had the opportunity.

833
01:24:42,797 --> 01:24:46,092
Yes, but I didn't do it.

834
01:26:15,507 --> 01:26:17,289
Excuse me. I'm a bit tired.

835
01:26:18,995 --> 01:26:20,042
I'll be back.

836
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:41,290
Lay her down there.

837
01:26:48,725 --> 01:26:51,341
–I'm going back.
–It's out of the question.

838
01:26:51,381 --> 01:26:53,388
Nobody tells me when to stop!

839
01:26:54,166 --> 01:26:55,113
What do we do?

840
01:26:55,285 --> 01:26:57,555
I'm sorry. Have everyone leave.

841
01:26:58,101 --> 01:27:00,206
–I'm going back!
–No, Edith!

842
01:27:00,374 --> 01:27:02,926
–I must go on.
–It's suicide.

843
01:27:03,094 --> 01:27:04,850
She must be hospitalized.

844
01:27:06,198 --> 01:27:09,133
No! Louis, I'm begging you!

845
01:27:09,302 --> 01:27:12,110
You were just in the hospital
three weeks ago.

846
01:27:12,150 --> 01:27:14,453
There will be other galas.

847
01:27:14,903 --> 01:27:18,165
Take me back on stage!

848
01:27:18,614 --> 01:27:20,720
Take me back. I must sing!

849
01:27:20,887 --> 01:27:24,084
I must sing, Louis. I have no choice!

850
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:27,637
Edith, please…

851
01:27:28,183 --> 01:27:30,933
–Do you hear them?
–Stop…

852
01:27:31,992 --> 01:27:33,367
Close that door!

853
01:27:33,912 --> 01:27:35,439
Take me back, Louis.

854
01:27:35,992 --> 01:27:39,987
Take me back.
If I don't sing tonight…

855
01:27:40,152 --> 01:27:42,836
If I don't sing at least one song…

856
01:27:43,001 --> 01:27:47,125
I'll lose all faith in myself.
Do you understand?

857
01:28:01,369 --> 01:28:02,863
Doctor…

858
01:28:04,282 --> 01:28:05,973
do what you must.

859
01:28:31,131 --> 01:28:34,480
Not this time, you guys.

860
01:28:34,652 --> 01:28:38,037
You expect me to fall on my face,
I'm in great shape.

861
01:28:38,077 --> 01:28:41,273
Tell your papers
it's not my suicide tour!

862
01:28:46,013 --> 01:28:47,387
“Padam.”

863
01:30:14,370 --> 01:30:16,944
Saint Theresa,
first of all, thank you…

864
01:30:18,466 --> 01:30:20,987
I know you're behind all this.

865
01:30:21,154 --> 01:30:23,521
You sent him to me.

866
01:30:24,099 --> 01:30:28,125
I've found love,
and I know it's your doing.

867
01:30:28,483 --> 01:30:31,964
Sweet Jesus, protect Marcel.

868
01:31:45,096 --> 01:31:46,983
Go, Marcel!

869
01:31:48,647 --> 01:31:49,924
Go now!

870
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:51,495
It's too soon, Edith.

871
01:31:51,656 --> 01:31:53,631
No, he'll win. I feel it.

872
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:57,364
–If there's a problem, you'll look bad.
–What problem?

873
01:31:58,473 --> 01:32:01,377
If there's a problem,
I'll call you. Now go.

874
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:14,470
Hurry up!

875
01:32:29,834 --> 01:32:31,460
Go, Marcel!

876
01:32:47,436 --> 01:32:49,475
One round!

877
01:33:03,948 --> 01:33:05,377
Go on, Marcel!

878
01:33:09,965 --> 01:33:11,372
Kill him!

879
01:33:48,303 --> 01:33:50,791
–What's happening?
–Zale's injured.

880
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:20,528
He did it? He's world champion!

881
01:35:20,085 --> 01:35:21,995
You look like an angel.

882
01:35:23,861 --> 01:35:26,097
Not like a fairy anymore?

883
01:35:32,694 --> 01:35:34,254
You are my champion.

884
01:35:34,422 --> 01:35:37,171
I want you to be mine for life.

885
01:35:37,527 --> 01:35:40,974
Nothing existed before you.
It's all gone.

886
01:35:45,207 --> 01:35:47,062
Stay with me.

887
01:35:51,190 --> 01:35:55,217
My beloved, yesterday before bed,
I crossed off a day…

888
01:35:55,383 --> 01:35:58,449
a long day, but also short.

889
01:35:58,615 --> 01:36:01,849
When the plane took off
it took with it my heart…

890
01:36:01,944 --> 01:36:04,246
my life, my breath…

891
01:36:04,408 --> 01:36:07,704
My sweet boy, my child, my love…

892
01:36:07,864 --> 01:36:09,488
your scent lingers in my sheets…

893
01:36:09,528 --> 01:36:12,495
and my heart sleeps incessantly…

894
01:36:12,664 --> 01:36:14,868
in the arms of sadness.

895
01:36:15,031 --> 01:36:16,046
My Darling…

896
01:36:16,216 --> 01:36:19,664
I love you. What have you done
to put me in this state?

897
01:36:19,704 --> 01:36:20,817
I miss you.

898
01:36:20,985 --> 01:36:25,295
I'm blank, listless
as though waiting for something…

899
01:36:25,465 --> 01:36:27,536
Hold me tight against your heart…

900
01:36:27,576 --> 01:36:31,952
and know nothing in the world
counts more than you.

901
01:36:32,121 --> 01:36:34,543
Return my heart to me.

902
01:36:34,714 --> 01:36:37,168
I think the French know about us.

903
01:36:37,338 --> 01:36:40,836
When I'm in a restaurant,
they play “La Vie en Rose”…

904
01:36:41,721 --> 01:36:43,827
When I see, my love…

905
01:36:43,994 --> 01:36:48,052
how attached you are
to your wife and your three children…

906
01:36:48,218 --> 01:36:50,390
I feel like going far away…

907
01:36:50,554 --> 01:36:54,930
thinking someday
you'll be grateful to me.

908
01:36:55,099 --> 01:36:59,377
I can't have you all for myself,
and can't live without you.

909
01:36:59,548 --> 01:37:02,980
God is my witness,
in this affair I ask for nothing…

910
01:37:03,099 --> 01:37:05,783
and am willing to sacrifice all.

911
01:37:07,739 --> 01:37:09,983
If one day life tears you from me…

912
01:37:10,171 --> 01:37:12,151
if you die or are far from me…

913
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:15,221
though you may love me,
I will die too.

914
01:37:19,773 --> 01:37:22,009
In three months…

915
01:37:22,364 --> 01:37:23,891
that's right, in April…

916
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:25,974
I'll be a hit at the Olympia.

917
01:37:26,077 --> 01:37:28,760
With a full house. We'll be flush.

918
01:37:28,956 --> 01:37:31,701
Edith, your liver cells
are not functioning normally.

919
01:37:31,741 --> 01:37:32,821
Paris, February 1960

920
01:37:32,861 --> 01:37:35,831
You've been ill.
You need rest. It's serious.

921
01:37:35,933 --> 01:37:38,421
I'm just 44. I'm not in the tomb yet.

922
01:37:38,589 --> 01:37:41,691
With the cancellations,
we have no more assets.

923
01:37:41,790 --> 01:37:43,830
You're saying it's my fault.

924
01:37:43,998 --> 01:37:47,446
That's not it, Edith.
It's the tax authority.

925
01:37:47,805 --> 01:37:50,969
We owe 120·000 francs
as a first installment.

926
01:37:51,134 --> 01:37:54,423
It's jaundice! I don't need
100 years to convalesce.

927
01:37:54,463 --> 01:37:56,252
That's pushing it.

928
01:37:57,343 --> 01:38:00,158
I want to perform at the Olympia!

929
01:38:05,951 --> 01:38:07,413
Anything else?

930
01:38:07,583 --> 01:38:10,333
Yes, we must stop giving in to her.

931
01:38:10,495 --> 01:38:12,829
I can't always keep an eye on her.

932
01:38:12,991 --> 01:38:15,037
She left the hospital too soon.

933
01:38:15,072 --> 01:38:19,095
The Olympia in three months…
It's a catastrophe waiting to happen.

934
01:38:19,135 --> 01:38:21,023
She needs these challenges.

935
01:38:21,184 --> 01:38:22,941
It's a losing proposition.

936
01:38:23,105 --> 01:38:26,809
Then I have to tell the insurance guys
it's all cancelled.

937
01:38:26,849 --> 01:38:29,177
We must decide for her, that's final.

938
01:38:29,217 --> 01:38:31,127
Whether she likes it or not.

939
01:39:00,162 --> 01:39:01,853
Edith…

940
01:39:22,724 --> 01:39:26,107
I said to myself, “Edith, it's all over!”

941
01:39:26,277 --> 01:39:28,061
He's got someone else. You lost him.

942
01:39:28,101 --> 01:39:29,685
He was having an affair?

943
01:39:29,701 --> 01:39:32,767
Would I be telling you this if he were?

944
01:39:32,964 --> 01:39:35,406
He left the restaurant. I was hiding.

945
01:39:35,525 --> 01:39:37,213
My Marcel crossed all of New York…

946
01:39:37,253 --> 01:39:41,530
to eat with an old blind black boxer…

947
01:39:41,701 --> 01:39:45,443
he had met a few years earlier.
Imagine that.

948
01:39:46,213 --> 01:39:48,414
Guys like that are hard to come by.

949
01:39:48,454 --> 01:39:50,243
“My Marcel”…

950
01:39:50,405 --> 01:39:53,472
“My Marcel”! That's all you talk about.

951
01:39:54,022 --> 01:39:55,549
Nothing else matters.

952
01:39:59,047 --> 01:40:01,315
But let me tell you, Ginou…

953
01:40:01,830 --> 01:40:03,423
I'll never have him.

954
01:40:03,943 --> 01:40:07,804
He'll never be mine.
He won't leave his wife and kids.

955
01:40:13,095 --> 01:40:15,364
He calls her every single day.

956
01:40:16,904 --> 01:40:18,488
I pretend not to notice.

957
01:40:18,664 --> 01:40:20,802
I want him to be happy.

958
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:24,028
I'll be back.

959
01:40:29,545 --> 01:40:31,683
I could've been Edith Piaf.

960
01:40:32,169 --> 01:40:34,503
There's more to life than songs.

961
01:40:45,449 --> 01:40:47,424
It's been too long, Marcel!

962
01:40:47,593 --> 01:40:49,771
Call Orly. Catch a plane tonight.

963
01:40:50,089 --> 01:40:52,597
The long journey by boat will kill me.

964
01:40:52,618 --> 01:40:54,887
I miss you, Marcel.

965
01:40:55,146 --> 01:40:57,699
I can't be apart from you anymore.

966
01:40:58,698 --> 01:41:00,810
Maybe I should go back to Paris?

967
01:41:01,546 --> 01:41:04,546
–Hold on.
–I'm just Madame's lapdog.

968
01:41:04,715 --> 01:41:06,056
Stop.

969
01:41:08,010 --> 01:41:10,825
Rum, Coke! Whiskey!

970
01:41:10,986 --> 01:41:13,474
People think I'm a piece of shit.

971
01:41:13,803 --> 01:41:16,389
Boozing it up in Belleville was better.

972
01:41:19,307 --> 01:41:21,097
You dropped me, Edith.

973
01:41:21,611 --> 01:41:23,400
Enough, Momone!

974
01:41:25,419 --> 01:41:27,559
Get her out of my sight.

975
01:41:31,819 --> 01:41:33,762
I'll be taking the boat.

976
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:36,678
Here's to your career, Edith!

977
01:41:41,805 --> 01:41:44,937
Please, Marcel. Leave tonight. For me!

978
01:42:34,704 --> 01:42:38,268
–You sleep late when I'm not here.
–Thank God, Marcel.

979
01:42:38,545 --> 01:42:40,203
Thank you.

980
01:42:49,489 --> 01:42:52,686
I'll make you some coffee. Don't move.

981
01:42:59,025 --> 01:43:01,065
Let me serve you.

982
01:43:17,586 --> 01:43:19,594
What are you doing there?

983
01:43:36,724 --> 01:43:38,382
I knew you'd come!

984
01:43:41,011 --> 01:43:43,946
Lucien had a rough time
buying the tickets.

985
01:43:49,012 --> 01:43:50,662
I have a present for you.

986
01:43:53,716 --> 01:43:55,473
You're in bad shape.

987
01:43:55,637 --> 01:43:58,125
You need sun. You're so pale.

988
01:44:06,710 --> 01:44:08,336
Ginou!

989
01:44:09,557 --> 01:44:12,340
Ginou. I'm looking for the watch!

990
01:44:17,942 --> 01:44:21,167
What's gotten into you?
I'm looking for the watch!

991
01:44:21,207 --> 01:44:23,791
It was here,
in a long red Cartier package…

992
01:44:23,831 --> 01:44:25,970
it was here, damn it!

993
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:35,855
What is wrong with you all?

994
01:44:35,895 --> 01:44:39,922
I'm looking for Marcel's watch!
Where is that watch?

995
01:44:44,344 --> 01:44:46,897
I'm looking for Marcel's watch!

996
01:44:47,481 --> 01:44:48,941
What?

997
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:51,447
Louis?

998
01:44:51,992 --> 01:44:53,683
What's going on?

999
01:44:55,737 --> 01:44:58,257
You must be brave, Edith.

1000
01:44:59,705 --> 01:45:01,461
Is it Marcel?

1001
01:45:02,745 --> 01:45:04,087
What?

1002
01:45:06,778 --> 01:45:08,785
The plane crashed…

1003
01:45:22,395 --> 01:45:24,020
Marcel!

1004
01:47:04,385 --> 01:47:07,036
What more can I tell you, Miss Piaf?

1005
01:47:08,001 --> 01:47:09,817
They say you're the best psychic…

1006
01:47:09,857 --> 01:47:11,646
That may be…

1007
01:47:11,809 --> 01:47:15,129
it's your third time this week.
What more can I say?

1008
01:47:15,169 --> 01:47:17,144
Why do you come back?

1009
01:47:18,689 --> 01:47:21,177
So that you can tell me again…

1010
01:47:22,434 --> 01:47:25,500
so I can remember why
I must go on living.

1011
01:47:26,946 --> 01:47:29,815
He died in the sky,
so he must be up there…

1012
01:47:41,699 --> 01:47:44,121
California, August 1955

1013
01:47:52,324 --> 01:47:55,586
Hey, Jacques Pills! Can you step on it?

1014
01:47:55,748 --> 01:47:57,242
I need some air.

1015
01:47:59,619 --> 01:48:00,568
That's lovely.

1016
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:03,675
Step on it. Our pin-up's melting!

1017
01:48:04,645 --> 01:48:06,467
I'll get a sore throat.

1018
01:48:06,629 --> 01:48:08,477
Then you'll take care of me…

1019
01:48:08,612 --> 01:48:09,932
like a good husband.

1020
01:48:09,989 --> 01:48:11,996
The best hubby I've had.

1021
01:48:12,164 --> 01:48:14,270
The first you've had!

1022
01:48:15,205 --> 01:48:17,987
You plan on gawking at us all day?

1023
01:48:21,126 --> 01:48:23,035
I'm sick to my stomach.

1024
01:48:23,301 --> 01:48:26,149
Watch it, you'll ram us
into the scenery.

1025
01:48:27,205 --> 01:48:30,304
Let me drive. Stop, I'll drive.

1026
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:32,739
That way Ginou can throw up.

1027
01:48:37,574 --> 01:48:38,523
Go on, Ginou.

1028
01:48:39,846 --> 01:48:42,180
May I help Madame…

1029
01:48:43,719 --> 01:48:45,442
Go on, Ginou!

1030
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:48,061
Very good. Bravo!

1031
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:54,814
Bye, Ginou.

1032
01:48:55,784 --> 01:48:57,726
Wait for me!

1033
01:49:01,223 --> 01:49:03,005
You sure know how to drive.

1034
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:08,374
At least our outing wasn't for nothing…

1035
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:10,823
we killed a tree!

1036
01:49:18,569 --> 01:49:20,838
Unbelievable, what shitty service!

1037
01:49:21,001 --> 01:49:23,685
Anybody here to take our order?

1038
01:49:24,233 --> 01:49:27,332
Calm down, dear. You're no star here.

1039
01:49:27,497 --> 01:49:29,025
Tonight you play the Mocambo.

1040
01:49:29,065 --> 01:49:30,211
Really?

1041
01:49:30,378 --> 01:49:32,931
Remind me who's invited us tomorrow?

1042
01:49:33,098 --> 01:49:36,960
Marlon Brando,
Ginger Rogers, Mr Chaplin…

1043
01:49:40,811 --> 01:49:42,273
What is that?

1044
01:49:43,947 --> 01:49:45,987
We never ordered that crap!

1045
01:49:56,620 --> 01:49:57,863
Don't touch me!

1046
01:49:58,028 --> 01:50:00,420
–Let me see.
–Don't touch me, I said!

1047
01:50:00,460 --> 01:50:02,532
Wipe yourself off.

1048
01:50:04,812 --> 01:50:07,114
We'd better get a divorce.

1049
01:50:11,437 --> 01:50:14,852
How many injections per day, Madame?

1050
01:50:15,789 --> 01:50:17,731
About ten…

1051
01:50:18,893 --> 01:50:21,795
Sorry to be so direct…

1052
01:50:21,965 --> 01:50:24,386
but why are you doing this?

1053
01:50:27,085 --> 01:50:29,606
So my body will shut up!

1054
01:50:32,846 --> 01:50:36,937
When did you start
these daily injections?

1055
01:50:37,102 --> 01:50:40,364
Five years ago,
after the plane crash. I…

1056
01:50:40,526 --> 01:50:45,228
I was becoming arthritic.
I couldn't knit anymore.

1057
01:50:46,895 --> 01:50:49,677
You are seriously dependant.

1058
01:50:50,511 --> 01:50:52,071
An addiction…

1059
01:50:52,239 --> 01:50:53,733
Doctor…

1060
01:50:54,031 --> 01:50:56,453
I'd like my wife to go to rehab.

1061
01:50:59,279 --> 01:51:01,002
I want to get better.

1062
01:51:01,167 --> 01:51:02,694
I can.

1063
01:51:07,311 --> 01:51:11,622
October 1960—5 years later

1064
01:51:31,634 --> 01:51:34,121
Danielle, a chair.

1065
01:51:43,057 --> 01:51:44,618
Edith…

1066
01:51:51,314 --> 01:51:53,070
Here, Edith.

1067
01:51:53,778 --> 01:51:55,534
Sit down.

1068
01:52:05,427 --> 01:52:06,671
Bruno…

1069
01:52:12,212 --> 01:52:14,578
There'll be no Olympia.

1070
01:52:21,012 --> 01:52:22,572
I understand, Edith.

1071
01:52:33,909 --> 01:52:35,567
No!

1072
01:52:42,166 --> 01:52:45,843
I want you to meet
Charles Dumont, composer…

1073
01:52:46,006 --> 01:52:48,276
and Michel Vaucaire, lyricist.

1074
01:52:48,566 --> 01:52:51,796
They've come back to play their song.

1075
01:52:59,352 --> 01:53:01,261
Be quick. I'm tired.

1076
01:53:37,881 --> 01:53:39,158
Stop!

1077
01:53:40,441 --> 01:53:42,197
I like it.

1078
01:53:42,617 --> 01:53:44,373
Go on!

1079
01:54:04,667 --> 01:54:06,423
You're marvelous!

1080
01:54:06,587 --> 01:54:09,843
Exactly what I've been waiting for.
It's incredible.

1081
01:54:09,883 --> 01:54:11,290
It's me!

1082
01:54:11,451 --> 01:54:13,754
That's my life. It's me!

1083
01:54:13,916 --> 01:54:16,468
Call Coquatrix. The Olympia is on!

1084
01:54:16,636 --> 01:54:18,970
Play it again. It's so beautiful.

1085
01:54:47,805 --> 01:54:51,435
“Take care my favorite sparrow.
Your friend Marguerite”

1086
01:54:52,189 --> 01:54:55,621
Everyone's here: Aznavour,
Mr Cocteau, Yves Montand.

1087
01:54:55,646 --> 01:54:58,679
Montand's here?
I read he wasn't in France.

1088
01:54:58,846 --> 01:55:00,024
He came for you!

1089
01:55:00,190 --> 01:55:02,423
They've been waiting for 30 minutes.

1090
01:55:02,463 --> 01:55:04,285
The place is heating up.

1091
01:55:15,551 --> 01:55:17,656
They're not too tight?

1092
01:55:19,935 --> 01:55:21,277
Who is that?

1093
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:22,967
A friend.

1094
01:55:43,393 --> 01:55:45,629
Come on, Edith…

1095
01:55:45,857 --> 01:55:47,383
stand up.

1096
01:55:52,609 --> 01:55:54,136
My cross?

1097
01:55:55,777 --> 01:55:57,370
My cross…

1098
01:56:00,386 --> 01:56:02,102
We forgot it. I'll get it.

1099
01:56:02,114 --> 01:56:03,698
I won't sing without it!

1100
01:56:04,610 --> 01:56:07,709
Out! Everybody out!

1101
01:57:15,111 --> 01:57:19,333
Grasse, October 1963
Her last night

1102
01:57:19,687 --> 01:57:21,061
See you tomorrow.

1103
01:57:21,223 --> 01:57:23,230
Go on. I'll handle it.

1104
01:57:27,943 --> 01:57:29,951
I'm afraid, Simone…

1105
01:57:30,119 --> 01:57:33,502
I'm losing my memory.
It's very serious.

1106
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:37,440
My thoughts are muddled.

1107
01:57:37,671 --> 01:57:40,868
I'm trying to remember…

1108
01:57:41,032 --> 01:57:43,204
but I can't.

1109
01:57:44,296 --> 01:57:48,868
Other memories are surfacing,
not the ones I want to see.

1110
01:57:51,401 --> 01:57:53,057
I wanted to see his watch.

1111
01:57:53,097 --> 01:57:55,518
Do you remember? Marcel's watch?

1112
01:57:55,690 --> 01:57:57,991
No, Edith. I didn't know him.

1113
01:57:58,153 --> 01:58:00,772
I wanted to see his watch…

1114
01:58:18,475 --> 01:58:20,514
That's some face!

1115
01:58:21,963 --> 01:58:23,905
You've got wild eyes.

1116
01:58:26,987 --> 01:58:29,127
The kid's not so bad.

1117
01:59:02,125 --> 01:59:03,369
Simone.

1118
01:59:03,534 --> 01:59:05,257
Yes, Edith?

1119
01:59:07,406 --> 01:59:09,610
I didn't pray.

1120
01:59:12,621 --> 01:59:15,110
I want to pray on my knees.

1121
01:59:15,822 --> 01:59:19,881
No one will reproach you
if you're not on your knees.

1122
01:59:20,239 --> 01:59:23,239
I want to pray for my daddy.

1123
02:00:23,570 --> 02:00:25,195
Marcelle…

1124
02:00:28,659 --> 02:00:30,667
My daughter, my little ghost.

1125
02:00:32,595 --> 02:00:34,570
Only Momone knows about it.

1126
02:00:35,283 --> 02:00:37,291
I need to tell you about my child.

1127
02:00:37,331 --> 02:00:38,603
Take it easy, Edith.

1128
02:00:38,643 --> 02:00:40,399
Marcelle!

1129
02:00:48,947 --> 02:00:52,265
Marcelle, go to bed.
I've had enough today.

1130
02:00:52,436 --> 02:00:56,048
Think I can keep an eye out
for the cops and your kid?

1131
02:00:56,212 --> 02:00:58,481
What the hell's Louis doing?

1132
02:00:59,573 --> 02:01:01,067
It's him. Your father.

1133
02:01:05,685 --> 02:01:06,929
Did she eat?

1134
02:01:07,221 --> 02:01:09,933
They said you were
on the street with her!

1135
02:01:09,973 --> 02:01:10,921
Who said?

1136
02:01:11,093 --> 02:01:14,356
You get her twice a month
and you screw up!

1137
02:01:14,518 --> 02:01:16,036
I said not the streets!

1138
02:01:25,399 --> 02:01:27,122
Come quick!

1139
02:01:28,983 --> 02:01:30,837
It's Marcelle! Come on!

1140
02:01:34,454 --> 02:01:36,236
Marcelle's in the hospital!

1141
02:01:57,784 --> 02:01:59,410
Are you her mother?

1142
02:02:00,217 --> 02:02:03,152
Meningitis. Nothing could be done.

1143
02:02:03,321 --> 02:02:04,979
I'm sorry.

1144
02:02:38,075 --> 02:02:39,536
Edith…

1145
02:02:41,019 --> 02:02:42,677
I have the cross.

1146
02:02:58,972 --> 02:03:00,533
Hello.

1147
02:03:00,700 --> 02:03:03,221
They said you were on the beach.

1148
02:03:04,060 --> 02:03:06,164
Thank you for granting this interview.

1149
02:03:06,204 --> 02:03:08,115
My pleasure.

1150
02:03:09,148 --> 02:03:11,656
It's odd to see you so far from Paris.

1151
02:03:11,805 --> 02:03:14,194
I'm never far from Paris.

1152
02:03:15,549 --> 02:03:20,186
I've a list of questions.
Answer whatever comes to mind.

1153
02:03:24,286 --> 02:03:25,747
Well…

1154
02:03:26,110 --> 02:03:28,019
what is your favorite color?

1155
02:03:28,318 --> 02:03:29,746
Blue.

1156
02:03:29,918 --> 02:03:31,707
What's your favorite dish?

1157
02:03:31,870 --> 02:03:33,845
Pot roast.

1158
02:03:35,326 --> 02:03:38,261
Would you agree to live a sensible life?

1159
02:03:38,431 --> 02:03:40,535
It's already the case.

1160
02:03:44,383 --> 02:03:46,647
Who are your most faithful friends?

1161
02:03:46,687 --> 02:03:49,405
My true friends are faithful.

1162
02:03:51,295 --> 02:03:53,848
If you could no longer sing…

1163
02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:57,816
I could no longer live.

1164
02:03:58,975 --> 02:04:00,950
Are you afraid of death?

1165
02:04:02,208 --> 02:04:04,346
Less than solitude.

1166
02:04:06,208 --> 02:04:07,353
Do you pray?

1167
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:11,066
Yes, because I believe in love.

1168
02:04:11,936 --> 02:04:13,846
I don't want to go, Simone.

1169
02:04:14,881 --> 02:04:16,375
Where is Théo?

1170
02:04:16,864 --> 02:04:18,686
I want my husband.

1171
02:04:18,849 --> 02:04:21,423
Théo will be here in less than an hour.

1172
02:04:22,369 --> 02:04:25,119
What is your fondest career memory?

1173
02:04:25,985 --> 02:04:28,506
Every time the curtain goes up.

1174
02:04:43,202 --> 02:04:45,756
Your fondest memory as a woman?

1175
02:04:46,626 --> 02:04:48,699
The first kiss.

1176
02:04:50,467 --> 02:04:51,919
Do you like nighttime?

1177
02:04:52,068 --> 02:04:55,068
Yes, with a lot of light.

1178
02:04:55,236 --> 02:04:56,665
Dawn?

1179
02:04:57,027 --> 02:04:59,612
With a piano and friends.

1180
02:04:59,780 --> 02:05:01,307
The evening?

1181
02:05:01,476 --> 02:05:03,995
Because for us it's dawn.

1182
02:05:09,476 --> 02:05:11,810
See, you're breathing.

1183
02:05:19,045 --> 02:05:21,249
I can't go back.

1184
02:05:24,966 --> 02:05:26,307
I can't.

1185
02:06:03,943 --> 02:06:08,286
If you were to give advice to a woman,
what would it be?

1186
02:06:08,903 --> 02:06:10,430
Love.

1187
02:06:10,728 --> 02:06:12,157
To a young girl?

1188
02:06:12,328 --> 02:06:13,440
Love.

1189
02:06:13,608 --> 02:06:15,299
To a child?

1190
02:06:15,976 --> 02:06:17,471
Love.

1191
02:06:20,105 --> 02:06:22,210
Who are you knitting for?

1192
02:06:23,784 --> 02:06:26,239
Whoever will wear my sweater.

1193
02:06:28,137 --> 02:06:32,130
That's all. I hope it wasn't too long.

1194
02:06:34,025 --> 02:06:35,345
Thank you very much.

1195
02:06:35,433 --> 02:06:37,703
Thank you, young lady.

1195
02:06:38,305 --> 02:07:38,860

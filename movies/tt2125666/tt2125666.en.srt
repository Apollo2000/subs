3
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,206
Wanna do one on his lap?

4
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,006
Oh. Oh.
I'm in pain.

5
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,801
- Is this Santa Claus?
- I'm in pain.

6
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,929
We've been doing this
for four hours.

7
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:56,472
- Three.
- Three hours.

8
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,316
My husband, when I got married to him,

9
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,402
all I wanted
was love from him.

10
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,614
And he always said,
"Trust me,"

11
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,868
and I put my trust
into him.

12
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:03,038
So if-- so...

13
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,583
we'll see what happens.

14
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,544
- Yeah.
- Okay.

15
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,566
In the breakfast room,
the lock--

16
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,693
if you pull on it,
it comes out,

17
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:33,944
but I'll be there
in two minutes.

18
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,362
I'll show them
when I come in.

19
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,740
Goddamn, our house
is falling apart.

20
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,159
Why do you think
she's trying to block you?

21
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,828
You said you--
you don't care what I do.

22
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,663
I said I don't care what you think.

23
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,624
We're home.

24
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,251
There's no place like home.

25
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,254
There's no place
like home.

26
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,465
It's always nice
to be home.

27
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,217
And no place
like your own bed.

28
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,303
Through these
hallowed gates.

29
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,974
Mrs. Florida '93.

30
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,771
Aw, look.

31
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,272
Look at her.

32
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,566
She's worn out.

33
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:16,153
Look at me, I got to
come home in my socks...

34
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:21,825
'cause my children
took my shoes.

35
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,540
My name is
Jacqueline Siegel.

36
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,542
I am in Orlando,
Florida.

37
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,127
I'm a 43-year-old
mother of eight.

38
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,714
I am from Binghamton,
New York.

39
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,343
I'm not a city girl,
I'm a small-town girl.

40
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,846
Tell me when you're ready.

41
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,015
My name is David Siegel.

42
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,934
I'm 74 years old.

43
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,436
I am the founder,
president,

44
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,022
CEO of Westgate Resorts,

45
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,191
the largest
privately owned

46
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,026
time-share company
in the world.

47
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,279
When I grew up
in Binghamton, New York,

48
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,781
pretty much
the only place to work

49
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,908
and make money
was IBM.

50
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,035
And I figured
I could either be

51
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,621
a secretary
and work for an engineer

52
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,540
or I could be
an engineer.

53
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,001
So I got my computer
engineering degree,

54
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,336
and then I
worked at IBM.

55
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,921
I had this
little cubicle,

56
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,715
but there's hundreds
of other people,

57
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,050
engineers in their
own cubicles.

58
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,971
And then I came into
the office early one day

59
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,056
and I asked my manager,

60
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,100
"Which project
are you working on?"

61
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,686
He says, "I wrote
my own program

62
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,730
to count down

63
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:38,611
the years, days,
months, weeks,

64
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,280
minutes,
down to the second

65
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,240
of when I retire."

66
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:47,786
And I said, "Well,
why would you do that?"

67
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,624
He said, "Because
that's when I'm going
to start living my life."

68
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,376
And I said, "Wow."

69
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,253
I put in my resignation.

70
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,213
I was out of there
in a week.

71
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,841
I packed my bags and I moved
to New York City

72
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,676
and started modeling.

73
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,097
Then I met a man
on Wall Street.

74
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,599
I got married.

75
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,976
He moved me
to the Everglades.

76
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,354
And while I was down there,

77
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,649
I saw an ad in the newspaper
to win Mrs. Florida.

78
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,150
I entered it.

79
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,902
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you

80
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,112
your brand-new
Mrs. Florida.

81
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,907
Here is Jacqueline
Solomon.

82
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,451
And then I ended up getting a divorce.

83
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,411
And I met
my current husband

84
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,122
through Mrs. World.

85
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,875
Mrs. Florida '95
invited me

86
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,711
to her husband's
40th birthday party.

87
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,672
And being a bachelor

88
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,133
that had just gotten out
of a 27-year marriage,

89
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,594
first person I saw
was Jackie,

90
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,597
and I was smitten.

91
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,433
I thought she was the most
beautiful girl in the world.

92
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,395
It took me a while
to fall in love with him.

93
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:58,524
It just really felt wonderful
to be so adored.

94
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,237
That's what
attracted me.

95
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:06,031
There's 30 years
between us.

96
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,075
I tell you,
he doesn't need Viagra.

97
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,496
But at least there is that option
if he does, like--

98
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,039
I don't know,
10 years from now--

99
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,333
but at least
there's that option.

100
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,668
It's show-and-tell
today,

101
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,002
so I got to get them
to school.

102
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,672
- Bye.
- Bye.

103
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,799
All right, let's hurry.
Come on.

104
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,719
Let's go this way
so China doesn't bite us.

105
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:32,808
Bye.
Have a nice day.

106
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,351
Can't see what she sees in me,

107
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:38,063
but we have
a great relationship.

108
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,275
What she lacks
in being a housekeeper,

109
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,944
she makes up in--
she loves people,

110
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,072
has more friends,
she's a big extrovert,

111
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,366
but a good person,
a good heart,

112
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,244
and a good mother.

113
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,545
Okay, tilt your head.
There we go.

114
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,839
- Mommy.
- What?

115
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,049
Oh, lookit, the doggy's
eating a cockroach.

116
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,718
Ugh.

117
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,804
I grew up
in a one-bathroom,

118
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,766
three-bedroom house,
and I can remember

119
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:18,103
I would have to wait in line
to use the bathroom.

120
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,524
In this house we have, I think,
17 bathrooms.

121
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,902
In our new house
we have 30 bathrooms,

122
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,738
so you won't have to
keep your legs crossed

123
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,698
very long.

124
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,034
The reason why we really
want the bigger home--

125
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,870
for one thing, I think
my husband deserves it.

126
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,372
I think it'd be a lot like
a lifetime achievement.

127
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,792
I think he's worked
so hard.

128
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,835
And even though
this house,

129
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,838
which is 26,000
square feet, is so big,

130
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,633
we're bursting out
at the seams.

131
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,930
- Bye, girls.
- I'm going to go look at our new house.

132
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,490
Look at this thing.
Oh, my God!

133
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,826
We went to France
and we saw Versailles,

134
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,954
and we were inspired
by the French architecture.

135
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,206
I drew it on the back of an envelope

136
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,291
on my way to Las Vegas.

137
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,295
In Las Vegas, we looked out our window
and we kind of copied

138
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,090
the top three floors
of the Paris Hotel.

139
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,634
Probably should have used
smaller envelopes

140
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:34,304
because it turned out to be
the largest home in America.

141
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,139
We never sought out to build

142
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,975
the biggest house
in America.

143
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,561
It's just-- it, like,
kind of happened.

144
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,396
This is so beautiful.

145
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,356
This is our
grand ballroom.

146
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,608
We have the grand
staircase on each end.

147
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,110
Mm-hmm.
This is a palace.

148
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,196
Can you imagine, like,
the dances and the parties?

149
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,490
I said, "Well, I'd like
to have a bowling alley."

150
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,992
And then he says,
"I want a health spa."

151
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,703
And then I said,
"We need maid's quarters."

152
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:58,829
I forgot
how many kitchens.

153
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,039
10 kitchens.
We have a sushi bar.

154
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,376
Two tennis courts--
one will be a stadium court--

155
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,878
a full-sized
baseball field

156
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,672
which will double
as the parking lot

157
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,549
when we have parties.

158
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,927
This is our ice-skating
slash roller rink.

159
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,762
The children
have their own wing.

160
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,348
They have their playroom
with a stage

161
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,559
where they can perform

162
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,728
and do their--
whatever they do.

163
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,690
Okay, this is the staircase
that I would come up

164
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,526
if I was going
to visit the children.

165
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,612
We wanted to put
everything

166
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,323
that we could dream of
in this home.

167
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,868
And we're going to have,
like, an orchestra up here...

168
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,246
- Uh-huh.
- ...for black-tie affairs.

169
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:45,208
The house will be filled
with Louis XIV-type

170
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,877
antique furniture.

171
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,879
That's our observation deck.

172
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,464
Every night
we go up there

173
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,758
to watch
the Disney fireworks.

174
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,886
So, by the time we both
got what we wanted,

175
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,930
now it's 90,000
square feet.

176
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,723
Jackie, is this your room?

177
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,391
No, that's not my room.

178
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,018
- Where's your room?
- That's my closet.

179
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:06,396
Oh, no way!
No way!

180
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,190
Where's David's closet?

181
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,901
Oh, that's his closet.

182
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,362
- That's my husband's closet.
- All right, this is it.

183
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,449
My husband filled
the garages up

184
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,076
with our marble
from China.

185
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,955
This is what $5 million
worth of marble looks like.

186
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,166
I gotta go
kiss my dog.

187
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,670
My husband knew how special
Chanel was to me,

188
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:33,799
so he had her stuffed for me,
and now she's upstairs.

189
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,218
And this one, a staff member

190
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,762
ran over him in the driveway,

191
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,473
but now he's on my piano.

192
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,559
So, you ask me
why I'm building

193
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,395
the largest home
in America.

194
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,689
And my answer is
because I could.

195
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,774
You mentioned being a kingmaker

196
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:54,611
and having a big role
in the 2000 election.

197
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,029
I sure did.

198
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,199
I got George W. elected president.

199
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,618
Personally got him
elected president.

200
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,620
It is nice to be here
with so many good folks

201
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,248
- from the great state of Florida.
- Yeah!

202
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:10,502
Businessman David Siegel
says America owes a lot to him.

203
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,421
I think we are responsible

204
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,215
for George Bush
becoming president.

205
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,385
Now, had I not stuck
my big nose into it,

206
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:21,263
there probably wouldn't
have been an Iraqi war,

207
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,933
and maybe we might have
been better off-- I don't know.

208
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,810
How were you
personally responsible

209
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,353
for the reelection
of George Bush?

210
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,314
I-- I'd rather not say it,

211
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:36,028
'cause it may not necessarily
have been legal.

212
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:42,951
Jackie, can you imagine
falling down these stairs?

213
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:48,665
♪ Here she is, Miss America... ♪

214
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,376
This is so pretty!

215
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,712
This is, like, the nicest,
grandest house

216
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,922
in all of
the United States.

217
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,133
Right here.

218
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,970
What I have today
is what I worked hard for.

219
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,847
A fellow came to me
in 1980,

220
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,516
and he said he wanted to buy
10 acres of my orange grove.

221
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,101
He said, "I'm going
to time-share it."

222
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,603
I said, "What's that?"

223
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,104
He explained
the concept to me.

224
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,647
I fell in love
with the concept.

225
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,149
I didn't sell him
the land,

226
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,818
and I decided to build
a time-share resort

227
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,695
in the back
of my orange grove.

228
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,530
I started building
16 units,

229
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,492
which I thought was more
than I'd ever need,

230
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,786
and people started
buying them.

231
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:29,456
We now have 28 resorts
in 11 states.

232
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,750
The three largest
time-share resorts

233
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,086
in the world are all
Westgate Resorts.

234
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,713
We are considered
the Rolls-Royce

235
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,174
of the time-share industry.

236
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,302
They call me
the time-share king.

237
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,389
I have built one of the icon
properties in Las Vegas.

238
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:50,519
It's 52 stories
of beautiful blue glass.

239
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,855
At the last Miss USA,
Donald Trump, he said,

240
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,565
"Congratulations
on your new tower."

241
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,317
He said, "Got one
problem with it."

242
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,361
He says, "When I stay
in my penthouse suite,

243
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,239
I look out the window,
all I see is Westgate."

244
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,324
He said, "Can you turn
your sign down a little bit?"

245
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,245
I have the brightest sign
on the strip.

246
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,081
Well, we want to go to this
and we want to go tonight.

247
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,375
Well, then we can
set you up for the presentation

248
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:14,835
tomorrow morning
at 10:00.

249
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,170
We're going to do a walk-through
of the building,

250
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,880
and then we'll have
a light breakfast or a lunch.

251
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,757
In return, we give
you guys show tickets

252
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,343
to any of the shows
listed here.

253
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,513
You guys make
over 60,000?

254
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,014
- Yeah.
- Yes?

255
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,766
- Are you married?
- No.

256
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,393
Are you guys--
you're a couple,
though, right?

257
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:32,727
- Of course.
- Oh, yeah.

258
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,691
Now, the top five
floors of our building

259
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,402
are like penthouse
condominiums, full ownership.

260
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,654
Sylvester Stallone,
Bruce Willis,

261
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,323
the Rock, Usher-- those are some
of the celebrities that own upstairs.

262
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,952
This isn't just a celebrity
wall of fame of who's who,

263
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,079
this is David Siegel,
our developer and owner.

264
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,790
A lot of these are different
charity events he donates

265
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,208
a lot of time and money to.

266
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,376
So that's a good thing.

267
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,044
Let's go on out
in the hallway.

268
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,298
This is South Beach, Miami.

269
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,466
This is the Lakes,
which is in Orlando.

270
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,219
This is Park City, Utah.
This is where you guys are
going to learn to ski.

271
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,721
Okay.

272
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,640
You know, the typical
time-share family

273
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:14,978
will stay in a motel
with two queen size beds,

274
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,064
small TV on the dresser,
and one bathroom.

275
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,816
When they walk
into the room,

276
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,027
the kids want to turn on
their cartoons,

277
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,029
the wife wants to watch
her soap operas,

278
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,530
and the husband
wants to watch

279
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,033
his football game
or sporting event.

280
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,701
They get up
in the morning,

281
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,077
they go
in the bathroom,

282
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,079
the wife goes in,
steams up the mirror

283
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,748
so the husband
can't shave.

284
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,709
They go out
and we have a booth,

285
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,212
and we say, "Well,
if you'll spend 90 minutes

286
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,047
and see what
we have to offer,

287
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,591
you can get
free Disney tickets."

288
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,259
And at 7:00
in the morning,

289
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,220
they're lined up
at my resort.

290
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,347
As they're getting
out of their car,

291
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,265
the wife is saying
to the husband,

292
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,267
"Don't you dare
buy anything."

293
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,769
And he says,
"Oh, don't you worry,

294
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,187
they won't sell me
anything."

295
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:00,774
- You guys ready for the wow factor?
- Yeah.

296
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,859
All right, this is
our four-bedroom.

297
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:06,279
- This is 2,382 square feet.
- Okay.

298
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,241
This accommodates
14 people comfortably.

299
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,742
You much
of a sports fan?

300
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,744
You've got the choice
of watching it on the flat screen

301
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,456
or-- this is where the projector screen
comes down.

302
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,792
And it just
blows them away.

303
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,544
That motel-- if it looked bad
before they came,

304
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,338
it looks
twice as bad after,

305
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,423
and all they do
is dream about

306
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,134
coming back the next year
and staying at Westgate.

307
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:32,430
We show them how what they're going
to spend on motels

308
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,557
over the next
10 or 15 years,

309
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,851
they can afford
this time-share.

310
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:37,978
Let me ask you guys this:

311
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,771
- Do you like the units?
- Yeah.

312
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,398
Could you see yourself
going back to renting

313
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,234
regular hotel rooms
and giving this up?

314
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,236
- No.
- Absolutely not.

315
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,321
All right,
if it were affordable,

316
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,241
is it something you guys
would consider owning today?

317
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,452
- Yes.
- Let's go downstairs.

318
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,746
Let me show you what
it looks like on paper.

319
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:00,375
Everyone wants
to vacation like a Rockefeller.

320
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,836
We show people
how they can.

321
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,213
Everyone wants
to be rich.

322
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,798
If they can't be rich,

323
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,343
the next best thing
is to feel rich.

324
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,637
And if they don't
want to feel rich,

325
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,433
then they're probably dead.

326
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,728
In my heyday of my shopping,

327
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,230
I probably spent over
a million dollars a year.

328
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:26,484
I have a $17,000 pair
of Gucci crocodile boots.

329
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,029
I have ostrich feather
Gucci pants

330
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,031
that are probably $10,000.

331
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,699
I have a ton of purses.

332
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,534
I think purses
are a good investment.

333
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,077
If you ever
get into a bind,

334
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,871
you can always
sell them on eBay.

335
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,914
Of course,
I'm just the opposite.

336
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,833
I could care less
about clothes

337
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,918
or material things.

338
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:47,630
Mr. David is a real disciplined man.

339
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,716
He's my idol.

340
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:53,762
He exactly knows what's
going on in this house,

341
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,680
every corner
of this house.

342
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,516
He monitors our bills
for water and electric.

343
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,144
Even if he earns
billions of dollars,

344
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:04,773
he knows exactly what--
where his money goes.

345
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,150
- Hi, Ricky.
- Hi.

346
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,028
- Hey, Ricky.
- Hi, Ricky.

347
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,614
- Hi.
- Hi, Ricky.

348
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,116
Hi.

349
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,702
- Hi, Ricky.
- Hi.

350
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,955
- Ready?
- Oh, yeah.

351
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,416
These kids,

352
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,002
they're the king and queen
of the house.

353
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,548
I have eight children--

354
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,843
seven by birth
and one that I inherited.

355
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,388
Having my children
fulfill me.

356
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,431
When I was going through
my modeling career,

357
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,183
I didn't want children.

358
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,727
First of all, I thought
it would destroy my body.

359
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,229
Then I couldn't stop
having them.

360
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,524
It was like an addiction.

361
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,819
Or maybe it's because I finally found
a husband that would make love to me.

362
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,158
I changed a lot
of people's lives.

363
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,120
A lot of people are better off
for knowing me.

364
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:04,874
I certainly changed
my three wives' lives.

365
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,294
I brought wonderful
children into the world.

366
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,505
You know, I have
seven under 12.

367
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,465
I have six
grown children.

368
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,301
I think everybody
is better off

369
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:19,973
for being either my child
or my employee.

370
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,183
Rise and shine, Drew.

371
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,102
We're leaving
in 15 minutes.

372
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,396
Rise and shine.

373
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,566
Come on,
rise and shine, Drew.

374
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,734
Drew likes to stay
in my room.

375
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:35,363
Maybe he feels comfortable
and safe in a small room.

376
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,031
It's like my teddy bear at night.

377
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,243
I hug him and he gives me--
like I'm a mom.

378
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,328
Even though I'm not
the real mom,

379
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,456
I'm not the biological mother,

380
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,749
but I feel like I'm a mom.

381
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,251
I'm not their--

382
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,587
are you done, Drew?

383
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,714
Flush the toilet.
Come on.

384
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:57,510
- You're at ISO 320?
- Man

385
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,012
My name's Victoria Siegel,

386
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,638
but I like to be
called Ricky,

387
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,390
and I'm 12 years old.

388
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:07,187
I'm the oldest out of seven kids,
plus my cousin Jonquil.

389
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,688
She's 16.

390
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,858
Jonquil is actually my niece,

391
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,359
my brother's daughter.

392
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,321
She was estranged from him
for many years

393
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,406
and her mother passed away.

394
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:25,330
Jonquil grew up in kind of
a broken environment.

395
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,416
When we got Jonquil down here,
she had no clothes.

396
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,210
She came down
with one little suitcase

397
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,670
filled up with these filthy,
dirty stuffed animals

398
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,049
that had never been washed
and dirty underwear.

399
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,967
I said, "Tell me
what your room's like

400
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,595
so I can, you know,
kind of decorate your room."

401
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:44,390
And she said,
"Well, my room's, uh..."

402
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:50,146
You know how she talks--
like, "The dirt room."

403
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,690
I said, "What do you mean,
the dirt room?"

404
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,611
"Well, it's in the basement
and it's got a dirt floor."

405
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,112
I remember one time
she told me, like,

406
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,989
she got kicked out
of her house or something.

407
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:03,368
She had to sleep on the streets
one time with her mom

408
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,203
in a playground
or something.

409
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,621
Now that I've got
a taste of it--

410
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,248
like I've had a taste
of dirt-poor

411
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,959
and a taste of filthy rich,
yeah, I like it.

412
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,419
I mean, who wouldn't?
Getting everything you want?

413
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,129
But at the same time,
I still want to, you know,

414
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,340
be the old me
in a way.

415
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,133
I don't want to be,
like, totally changed.

416
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,094
You know, I don't want
to be spoiled.

417
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,804
We used to be kind of snobby.

418
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,348
Like, at my birthday parties
I would get a tiger,

419
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,559
and I would brag
to my friends

420
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,269
that we have
a pet tiger and stuff.

421
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,813
And then I used to be
a brat to my mom,

422
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,773
but then Jonquil
came here and--

423
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,775
I don't know, she's changed
a bunch of us.

424
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,904
So now we're just like,

425
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,406
I don't know,
normal, I guess.

426
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,533
Nothing's really normal
about this life.

427
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,827
Like, you know, getting
everything you want,

428
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,997
having a huge house
and another one in construction,

429
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,374
having drivers,
you know--

430
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,376
it's like you don't really
have to worry about money,

431
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,378
but at the same time
you do.

432
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,382
- Hey, how are you?
- Hey, haven't seen you.

433
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,885
- I need to look like Miss Universe.
- Okay.

434
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,513
Do you think purple
looks good in my hair?

435
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,057
- I'm in a big rush, so...
- Okay.

436
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,768
- We got a Miss America party tonight.
- Okay.

437
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,104
If you could make them
look pretty for--

438
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,814
we have all
50 contestants coming,

439
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,733
- and Miss America at our house.
- Ooh, nice.

440
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,819
- Okay.
- So they need to look like pre--

441
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,529
like Miss Teen Americas.

442
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,993
Get, like, 50 pieces
of chicken nuggets.

443
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,454
- What do you guys want?
- A couple Big Macs.

444
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,497
- And a Diet Coke.
- And a Diet Coke for her.

445
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,333
Okay, just get, like,
50 chicken nuggets

446
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,126
and we'll share it
with everyone in the salon.

447
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,919
- No, I don't like chicken nuggets.
- With all the sauces.

448
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,672
- Wow.
- How beautiful.

449
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:54,854
We're proud to present
a check for $25,000

450
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:59,233
to the Miss America
Foundation.

451
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:03,404
Hey, did my stairs get shorter
or are these girls--

452
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,865
- We only had 38 of them here last year.
- Oh.

453
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,576
- All of them are here this year.
- Wow.

454
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,205
I love beautiful women.

455
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,957
I grew up during
the Miss America days

456
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,795
when Miss America was
the most famous woman in the world.

457
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:23,216
I used to actually get tears
in my eyes when I watched

458
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,468
"Here She Comes,
Miss America."

459
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,595
And I'm trying to do
what I can

460
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,598
to bring it back
to where it was.

461
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,308
Okay, ready, David? Here we go.

462
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,353
Jacqueline, here we go.
Big smiles.

463
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,647
I got to talk with Mrs. Siegel,

464
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,649
and she was telling me
a little bit about her background,

465
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,652
and it's kind of similar how
my background parallels to her

466
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,363
'cause we kind of
came from not very much,

467
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,365
but it's something
that I'm very proud of.

468
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,908
I'm very proud
of my background

469
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,994
growing up on a dairy farm
in a small town in Indiana.

470
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,663
And now I'm Miss America.

471
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,790
It just goes to show you
that anything is possible,

472
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,000
but not without hard work
and dedication

473
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,128
and passion
for what you do.

474
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,672
She wants to get married
and have babies.

475
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,674
That's what she wants.

476
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,968
And does
Miss America allow for that?

477
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,678
Does it create
opportunities for that?

478
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:10,805
Well, if she accepts
my proposal,

479
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,765
but she hasn't
accepted it yet.

480
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,563
He is a hoot.

481
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,442
There's a downside to everything.

482
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,152
Of course there is.

483
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,945
My husband told me
when I turn 40,

484
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:29,157
he's going to trade me in
for two 20-year-olds.

485
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,409
- Hey, hi!
- She's from Oviedo.

486
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,994
You're a tall one.

487
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,954
- Miss Colorado.
- I love Colorado.

488
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:38,166
I love Wisconsin.
Wyoming, great state.

489
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,712
Hey, Victoria, can I get a picture
of you and Miss America?

490
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,173
This is Victoria.

491
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,427
- Got it.
- Thank you, Victoria.

492
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,720
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

493
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,808
Oh, what's wrong
with being rich?

494
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,393
That, too.

495
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,978
Now, what would
you rather have,

496
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,897
a rich guy
or a good-looking guy?

497
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,567
Have you ever wondered
what it was like

498
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,277
to be like a fish?

499
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,071
- Me?
- Yeah.

500
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,824
- Um, not really.
- Oh!

501
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,160
I think we just lost Drew.

502
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,255
Good morning, Westgate!

503
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,386
- Why are we here?
- To save lives!

504
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,222
To save lives.

505
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:37,350
And you thought you were just selling
time-sharing, didn't you?

506
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,936
We sell vacations.

507
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:43,773
Vacations are
healthy for you.

508
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,067
- Do you believe that?
- Yes.

509
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,945
I can show you
the articles and the studies.

510
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,656
Those who take the fewest
amount of vacations

511
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,534
are most likely to have
a heart attack.

512
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,577
You're just like a doctor,

513
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,830
a nurse, a fireman,

514
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:03,167
a policeman,
a lifeguard.

515
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,963
They all save lives
and you all do it, too.

516
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,798
But we're not
just saving lives,

517
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:12,009
we're also saving marriages.

518
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,928
Mom's on Facebook
catching up

519
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,722
with all the friends and relatives
and Dad's going through the TV.

520
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,974
Where are the kids?

521
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:21,853
Playing video games.

522
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,688
So there's a breakdown
of the family unit.

523
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,731
There's no communication
going on anymore.

524
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,025
Once a year, folks,

525
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,863
take your kids
on vacation!

526
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,948
Get to know them.

527
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:36,367
Let them get
to know you again.

528
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,452
Our number one person
in Orlando

529
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,037
owns several weeks
of time-share.

530
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,040
You know, you should own
at least one week yourselves.

531
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,961
And if you don't,
lie and say you do!

532
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,381
Don't let these people leave here

533
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,175
without buying something.

534
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,635
Something.

535
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,512
Whether it's big or small,

536
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,890
make sure they buy
something.

537
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:02,643
Today, make a sale, save a life,
let's have a great day!

538
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,573
This is David A. Siegel Day

539
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,950
in Las Vegas
because he built

540
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,870
the new icon
on the Las Vegas strip.

541
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,039
This is the most expensive,

542
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,874
the biggest, and the nicest

543
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,376
that's ever been built
on the planet.

544
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,046
I did not grow up

545
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,089
with a silver spoon
in my mouth.

546
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,716
I grew up very meager.

547
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:36,010
I lived in
a 1 ,200-square-foot,

548
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,762
two-bedroom,
one-bath house

549
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,889
in Indianapolis, Indiana.

550
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:42,767
My father wasn't
that involved with me

551
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,853
as I was growing up
because he was in business

552
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:49,732
and had to make a living,
you know, for the family.

553
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:54,111
My grandparents
were never wealthy,

554
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:58,240
and the reason is is that they lost
their money in Las Vegas.

555
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:01,744
You know, the casinos in Vegas
aren't built with the owners' money,

556
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:03,704
it's built with
all the losers' money.

557
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:08,751
My grandparents
were Mr. and Mrs. Vegas.

558
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,129
When they walked
into the casino,

559
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:16,509
they were like, "We got your
favorite suite all lined up for you.

560
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,970
We have those show tickets
that you wanted.

561
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,889
You wanted to see that new guy Elvis
Presley, we got your tickets for him.

562
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,059
And Frank Sinatra--
we got you in the front row."

563
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,561
So, basically,
here's a nobody.

564
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,481
But when he's in Vegas,
he's a somebody.

565
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,275
Please welcome to the stage,
ladies and gentlemen,

566
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,903
Mr. David Siegel!

567
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,992
This building--
I'm going to dedicate it

568
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,493
to my mother and father.

569
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,412
My dad, he's looking
down on it.

570
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:45,955
He would be so proud.

571
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:49,583
Whoo!

572
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,422
I've set up all
of my sales departments

573
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:58,175
to copy what Vegas did
for my grandparents years ago.

574
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,262
When you walk in, you're like,
"Wow, this place is exciting."

575
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,473
100 % of the people
that we're talking to are--

576
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:08,394
it's not a nice word,
but we call them "mooches."

577
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:11,647
They're coming in
for a sales presentation

578
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,233
on their vacation
for a free gift.

579
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,277
So we train our salespeople
on how to take

580
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:20,865
someone greedy like that
and get them to buy today.

581
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:24,243
We do 100 % of our sales
on the first day.

582
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,745
We don't really take
many vacations

583
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,621
'cause it's really,
really expensive,

584
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,666
but if we had something
that would make it cheaper...

585
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,543
They will not buy today

586
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,796
if they don't get
a "great" deal,

587
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,758
if they don't believe
they're getting a great deal.

588
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,969
The total down payment
on this is $2,090.

589
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:45,389
- It's a whole lot better than 25,000.
- Yeah.

590
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:49,560
We sell them as low as $8,900

591
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,396
for three nights
in a studio

592
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,732
every other year,

593
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,736
all the way up to $149,900,

594
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,613
which is a four-bedroom

595
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:04,450
New Year's week every year forever,
their entire lives.

596
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:05,951
They pass it on
to their kids.

597
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,621
Their kids pass it
on to their kids.

598
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:11,290
Time-sharing--
typically you sell

599
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,335
every unit 52 times
because you sell it by the week.

600
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,921
May I say,
"Welcome to Westgate"?

601
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,672
I can't believe we did it.

602
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,050
You're changing your life.

603
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,551
We were in line

604
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,304
to do a billion dollars
in sales for the year.

605
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,806
Everything was great.

606
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,682
We were on top
of the world.

607
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,186
All we were thinking about
was adding more resorts

608
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,563
and employing
more people

609
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,524
and growing
the company larger,

610
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,359
and it came
to a screeching halt.

611
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,697
We got a big problem.

612
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:47,493
At one point, the market
fell over 700 points.

613
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,787
The day that left
Wall Street reeling.

614
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,122
Alan Greenspan called it

615
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,374
"a once-in-a-century
financial crisis."

616
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,668
September of 2008,

617
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:59,755
when the financial system
ground to a halt

618
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,757
with the bankruptcy
of Lehman

619
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,926
and all the banks
about to go under--

620
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,720
Wall Street is tumbling.
Main Street is stumbling.

621
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,056
Reporter

622
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,308
waiting to see how low
the Dow will go.

623
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,769
Banks lent hundreds
of billions of dollars

624
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,063
to home buyers
who can't pay them back.

625
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,274
Wall Street
took the risky debt,

626
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,442
dressed it up
as fancy securities,

627
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,987
and sold them around the world
as safe investments.

628
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,322
My business depends heavily

629
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,242
on easy access
to cheap money.

630
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,787
We sell our product
for 10 % down

631
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,707
and we take back
a 90 % mortgage.

632
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:37,376
What we used to do was take
those mortgages to the banks

633
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,045
and they would give us
an advance.

634
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:43,549
Well, unless we can turn
that mortgage into cash--

635
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,217
I can't very well
pay my employees

636
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,179
with mortgages
each week.

637
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,847
But the banks
are frozen

638
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,308
as far as my business
is concerned,

639
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,643
and it's a struggle
trying to find money

640
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,980
to finance our sales.

641
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:00,024
I don't think
I would rank myself

642
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:03,027
as a billionaire today.

643
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:07,781
I would say it's touch and go
right now.

644
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,390
So this used to be
the employee store?

645
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,143
- Yeah, this was the employee store.
- Oh, no more store.

646
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,853
No more store.

647
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,399
The reason they shut down
the telemarketing is because

648
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,109
there's no financing
for the sales--

649
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,070
'Cause the banks don't
want to lend the money.

650
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,864
Yeah, people
don't generally pay cash.

651
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,783
- It's like buying a car.
- Mm-hmm.

652
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,284
This whole side
was day shift.

653
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,036
And then the night shift--
that would be filled up.

654
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,996
So it was very lively
in here.

655
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,999
It was two days prior
to Thanksgiving.

656
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,417
Very sad.

657
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,711
So, you know,
spirits were high in here,

658
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,713
and then half the people
were called up to the front,

659
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,382
and those were
the people that were
going to be let go.

660
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,134
And then there was like
20 to 25 of us that were left.

661
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:13,555
I mean, I had never been
in a situation or an environment

662
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,058
where that many people
have lost theirjobs at one time.

663
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,768
You know, I mean,
the crying--

664
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,436

665
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,938
It was almost like
a funeral procession.

666
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:24,024
No, it's rough out there.

667
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,986
When I looked in that room
and to see all those empty cubicles,

668
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:30,864
to think of how full of life
that was at one time

669
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:34,118
and all those people
that had families,

670
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:37,997
and, like overnight,
all those jobs were gone.

671
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:41,792
When you have 7,000 people less,

672
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,420
you have a lot
of empty space.

673
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,965
They all had someplace
to go to work.

674
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,050
So those same people
that used to motivate me

675
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:55,014
are now out of work
and struggling, and I feel bad.

676
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,640
I feel bad for
every one of them.

677
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:01,895
I've affected a lot of lives
by what's going on.

678
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,148
Everything's for sale.

679
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,651
Our planes-- we have
an auction company

680
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,278
listing everything.

681
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,697
We're not selling
everything, but we're--

682
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,450
everything's available
for a price.

683
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:18,746
So, hopefully,
we can figure it out.

684
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,667
Got $100 million

685
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,794
just burning a hole
in your wallet right now?

686
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,629
Then you can buy
the palace

687
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,506
that time-share mogul
David Siegel

688
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,924
already wants to sell,

689
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,801
even though
it's not even complete.

690
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,762
The largest
single family home

691
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,764
under one roof
in America.

692
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,557
It's bigger than
the White House

693
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,434
and it could be
an entire land

694
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,519
at Walt Disney World's
Magic Kingdom.

695
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,021
It's a replica based on

696
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,732
the Royal Palace
of Louis XIV

697
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,525
of the 17th century.

698
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,778
My dream house
that I was building,

699
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:54,865
it's about 50 % complete.

700
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,368
I finally had to list it

701
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,370
and put it on the market

702
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,372
to satisfy my banks.

703
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,541
It's the jewel
of the United States.

704
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,168
There's never been
anything like this.

705
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:08,837
This is a true visionary,

706
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,631
modern-day palace.

707
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,591
And we all know
that you can't go

708
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,843
to France and purchase
Versailles,

709
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,845
because it's used
as a museum.

710
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,555
So it's your own
Versailles

711
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,182

712
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,519
Well, we're listing the house
finished for $100 million,

713
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,979
unfinished for $75 million.

714
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,190
We've got over
$50 million into it,

715
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:30,526
plus the land
and all that,

716
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:33,695
and the bankers
want us to unload it

717
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,365
for under $15 million.

718
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:41,286
I hope they left
a door open for us.

719
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,996
I can jump through
a window, Mom.

720
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,957
Don't worry.

721
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,048
So, who likes
the beautiful window?

722
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,800
- I love that.
- Yeah, that was over

723
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:58,095
a quarter of a million dollars.

724
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,097
Mommy, is that
a lake?

725
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,057
That's the lake,
yes.

726
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,435
Look at all those spiders.

727
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,145
Wow!

728
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,732
So, Marissa, just think
of the bright side--

729
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,276
you might not have
to clean this house.

730
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,445
- Hi. How are you?
- Good. How are you?

731
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,905
- Very good.
- Wow, this is just incredible.

732
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,407
I'll tell you,
it gives me goose bumps

733
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,826
every time I walk
through here.

734
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:24,204
- It's kind of an emotional day.
- Oh, of course it is.

735
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,915
This is our
dream home, but you can't cry

736
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,084
over things that
you cannot change.

737
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:34,840
Mom, do you think that

738
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:37,676
somebody's going
to buy it?

739
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,428
I don't know.

740
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,932
I don't know
if they'll buy it or not.

741
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,977
Not that many people

742
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,104
can afford
that kind of house.

743
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:53,275
In that $75 million range,
there's not too many people.

744
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:54,943
Even the ones
that have money,

745
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:58,363
Orlando would have to be
the place they want to be.

746
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,407
Tiger lives here still,

747
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:04,536
Shaq, and there's a lot
of real estate people,

748
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:08,123
orange juice families, and--

749
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,875
here it's like
feast and famine.

750
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,502
I mean, some of these people
have so much money,

751
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,794
they don't know
what to do with it.

752
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,505
They're spending it
like crazy,

753
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:18,300
and then the other ones can just
barely afford to keep what they got.

754
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,640
Since I was young,

755
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:29,144
I've been dreaming how I wish
I could go to America.

756
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:33,982
Every Filipinos, it's our dream
to have our own house.

757
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,609
Those Filipinos
that was here,

758
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,736
they have their families
in the Philippines,

759
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,155
and they have big houses.

760
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,324
I bought a piece of land,

761
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:46,328
so if God permit
I can go home,

762
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:47,871
maybe I will
build a house

763
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,123
for that piece of land
that I bought.

764
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,168
I need some money
to go home.

765
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,880
If you go without money,
it's not easy.

766
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,925
So I need to save
some money.

767
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:02,844
- Come on, let's go.
- No.

768
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,346
- But, Virginia...
- What?

769
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:07,516
I have, like-- I still have, like,
five more tardies left.

770
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:10,018
- It doesn't matter.
- No, they're going...

771
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:13,021
It's already 11 years.

772
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:16,149
The children
really attached to me.

773
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,777
I really love them
like my own,

774
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:22,781
since I do not have
my family here.

775
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,122
It's just that

776
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,707
the last time
I see my kids,

777
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:34,459
my youngest one,
he's only seven years old,

778
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,837
and now he's 26.

779
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:39,172
The Siegel kids,
they always say,

780
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,133
"Nanny, I love you,"

781
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,135
one thing that I never heard
from my children.

782
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:46,597
So I'm happy for that.

783
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,640
I miss them.

784
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,393
It's okay.

785
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,645
I still have kids,

786
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,647
the Siegel kids.

787
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,579
Hey, you need to go faster
if you wanna burn calories.

788
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:25,594
- You want French fries?
- No, I'll wait.

789
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,725
Hey, what's going on
with this building?

790
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,770
It looks kind of vacant.
- It's all
in foreclosure.

791
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,563
It's a shame.
This is a nice area.

792
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,523
They built
a nice thing here.

793
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,067
It's a pretty building.

794
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,694
I heard there's, like,
65 foreclosures

795
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,238
just an hour worth
where I live.

796
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:48,116
It's kind of sad,
you know?

797
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,868
Yep.

798
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,456
It's changed a lot
in the last three years.

799
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:58,210
A lot of people don't like
to be seen in limos anymore.

800
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:01,088
They think it sends the wrong signal
when times are tough.

801
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,715
Are you ready for
your cheeseburger in paradise?

802
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:07,469
I met Jackie and David
at a Little League baseball game.

803
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,722
Our boys play
Little League together.

804
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,475
She was volunteering
behind the concession stand.

805
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:16,311
A lot of people are afraid
to talk to them,

806
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,147
you know, 'cause they're
very powerful people,

807
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,982
but they're just like
everybody else.

808
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,359
They're down-to-earth.

809
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:25,987
Hey, Drew, do you know
which field it's on?

810
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,825
Strike!

811
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,535
You'd have
to show me that.

812
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,829
I don't follow you.

813
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:37,708
But they're not funding me
enough for Vegas.

814
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:42,546
I will-- look, I'm at my son's
baseball game,

815
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:45,132
and when it's over,
I'll call you back.

816
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,633
There you go.

817
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,802
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

818
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,640
- Come on, Drew, one more strike!
- Come on, Drew!

819
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,184
Is that cute or what?

820
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,355
I want to see our house
finished so bad.

821
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,857
You got this one. Come on.

822
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,191
What do you think of that dome?

823
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,901
It's like from the Vatican.

824
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,737
With the sun
shining through,

825
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,239
it'll look like
jewels up there.

826
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,533
You know, I paid cash for the house

827
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,034
and then put
a mortgage on it

828
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,536
and put the money
in the company,

829
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:16,288
just like with the house
that I'm in now.

830
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,832
Why have an asset that doesn't
have a mortgage on it

831
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,834
when you're using money
to make money?

832
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:23,170
I bought you
a lottery ticket the other day.

833
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:26,798
- That's a waste of money.
- Not if you win.

834
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,260
Ugh.

835
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,517
Come on, Drew.

836
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,895
How was it
flying commercial?

837
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:43,273
The first time I
took the boys on a commercial plane,

838
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,567
they said, "Mommy,
what are all these people

839
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:47,486
doing on our plane?"

840
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,530
Okay, now we got to get a car
or something, right?

841
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,199
Yeah.

842
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,244
From Florida?
What brings you here?

843
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,956
I'm coming here to visit
some friends and family

844
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:03,418
that I haven't seen
in, like, over 10 years,

845
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,420
some of them maybe 15.

846
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,422
You're from here?

847
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,801
Binghamton, actually,
but it was cheaper to fly here

848
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,595
and I'm on a budget now.

849
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:16,807
What's my driver's name?

850
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,894
- I'm sorry?
- What's my driver's name?

851
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,272
Oh, it doesn't come
with a driver?

852
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,858
- It's included?
- There's no driver. No.

853
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,110
Sorry.

854
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,072
Oh, here's Beth.

855
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,074
I've got my kids.

856
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,117
- They can't wait to go swimming.
- Oh, good.

857
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:39,120
Oh, I missed you.

858
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,414
- Thank you again.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

859
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,916
It's good seeing you.

860
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,626
Jackie and my granddaughter Beth

861
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:46,503
became very good friends.

862
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:49,881
I think everything that
happened to her is unusual.

863
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:53,468
I don't know anybody that
married such a wealthy man.

864
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,637
Jackie worked
at a diner

865
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:58,181
and did very, very well
in school.

866
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,683
But engineering back then

867
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:03,103
was kind of unusual
for a girl to do,

868
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:05,438
but I figured,
well, she was smart,

869
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,148
so that's what
she wanted to do.

870
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,943
The first marriage
was a big mistake.

871
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,195
Not-- of course, at the beginning
they didn't think so,

872
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,864
but I think
as time went on,

873
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,449
she had many
serious problems.

874
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,160
I was in a marriage to a man

875
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:22,330
that became
more and more abusive.

876
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,417
He started to hit me
and stuff like that,

877
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:29,004
and then he gave me
a scar across my face.

878
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:31,548
He says, "Now you can't
make your own money."

879
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:35,135
And I went to the hospital
and he went to jail that night.

880
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,596
And the next morning,
I just grabbed

881
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:40,015
as many of my modeling
pictures as I could--

882
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,641
I mean, that was
my whole life--

883
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,852
and some clothes
and that was it.

884
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,695
Now my turn.

885
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:59,951
Okay, my turn.
Now it's my turn.

886
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,870
Come on, kids.
Come on.

887
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:03,371
Come see where
Mommy grew up.

888
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,707
- Daniel.
- Come on.

889
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,376
I want to show you
where I grew up.

890
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:15,133
Oh, my God, look at how big
those trees got.

891
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,719
There she is.

892
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,471
I knew they were
building a house,

893
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,264
but that's all
I knew about it,

894
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,933
and it was unbelievable.

895
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,559
I mean,
who in heaven's name

896
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,771
has a $75 million house
they're going to sell?

897
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,481
And it isn't even done.

898
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:31,942
My husband had all these
Xerox copies made

899
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,443
of this news clipping

900
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,028
and I gave it
to everybody.

901
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:37,405
We went to a party
Saturday night,

902
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:40,075
and all my neighbors
that were at this party,

903
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:43,453
they now have a Xerox copy
of all this info

904
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,331
'cause I thought they'd
be interested in it, and they are.

905
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:49,918
Well, the American dream
is raising way up above

906
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:52,921
what you started with

907
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:55,298
and achieving something
way beyond

908
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,592
what anybody would dream
that you would achieve,

909
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,804
and that is exactly
what she has done.

910
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:03,723
Typical middle-class America

911
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,517
just wasn't going
to make her happy.

912
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:10,063
She wanted to do something
really exciting and really big.

913
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:13,149
Hi, kids!
Come on in!

914
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,110
I miss Jackie a lot.

915
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:18,113
Everywhere she was, I was.
And everywhere I was, she was.

916
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,490
Everyone would ask,
"Where's your other half?"

917
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,492
And that's how it was
all through high school.

918
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,995
It was supposed to be
that way after,

919
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,580
but then we made
different choices in our life.

920
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,208
She decided to go
to college

921
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:33,211
and I decided to marry
my high school sweetheart.

922
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,005
Tina, no, I am impressed.
This is a beautiful home.

923
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,549
- I'm happy for you.
- Thank you.

924
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:40,802
No, it's like a dream come true.

925
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:43,471
I would be lying
if I didn't say

926
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,932
I envy her life
to some extent.

927
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,352
I mean, there's a lot
of things in the world

928
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,564
that I'd like to see,
that I'd like to do.

929
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:55,150
I've never owned
a new car in my life.

930
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:57,736
If I didn't have cash
to buy a car,

931
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,487
I didn't have a car.

932
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,322
I never had a car payment.

933
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,199
I don't own a credit card.

934
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,411
So how do you guys think
you could do in a house this size?

935
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,329
- I like it.
- You like it?

936
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,749
I would love to have more money,

937
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:13,626
but I don't know that
I would want that much,

938
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:17,172
because my dreams
don't even go that big.

939
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:20,675
It looks little, but...

940
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:40,904
What about
the "for sale" sign

941
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:42,155
on the front
of the building?

942
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:44,157
Have you had a lot
of inquiries about that?

943
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:45,408
From the team
members, you mean?

944
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,618
- Yes.
- No.

945
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:48,453
After they got
past the auction--

946
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:49,954
- Yeah.
- That was a little bit scary.

947
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,372
The "for sale" sign is...

948
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,999
So when we put up
the "foreclosure" sign,

949
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,086
that's going to probably--

950
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,255
We had all of our
noncore assets

951
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,424
put up for an auction,

952
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:05,595
and we only sold, like,
one or two things.

953
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,515
You know, a hotel
which was valued
at 20 million

954
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:11,226
a couple years ago,
we sold for 8 1/2 million.

955
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:12,977
And so the auction
was a flop.

956
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,897
David Siegel, he is
spending all of his time

957
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,690
looking for money still.

958
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,859
Every day, all day long,

959
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,529
weekends included,
he is looking for money

960
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,823
to keep the Vegas
project going.

961
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,282
He's been to
Donald Trump's office

962
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,784
a couple times
trying to get help.

963
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:31,621
He's gone to Dubai
and Switzerland.

964
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,290
We're looking for
about $400 million.

965
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,960
So any of you that want
to write a check,

966
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,462
we'll pay you back
in a few years.

967
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:47,262
Basically-- basically, we spent
660 million to build it.

968
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:50,557
And right now, we owe
about 240 million.

969
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:54,978
So we have over 400 million
into it, you know.

970
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:58,815
We don't want to walk away
from that money, obviously.

971
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:04,070
He will tell you that the lenders
are pushers.

972
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:08,324
They got us addicted
to cheap money,

973
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,993
and once
we were addicted,

974
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:11,953
they took away
our money,

975
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:14,080
and now we're addicts.

976
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,707
We have to have
that money in order

977
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:18,668
to maintain the company
that we built.

978
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,754
...two-bedroom deluxe.

979
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,548
Yes, ma'am,
I am aware of that, but...

980
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:25,925
My father
is all about quantity.

981
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,011
He wants to take any deal.

982
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,221
I don't care if they give us $50,
take the deal.

983
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,265
Our customer
is the Walmart customer,

984
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,766
the Johnny Lunchbucket--

985
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:38,021
you know, your $40,000,
$50,000 people.

986
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:40,648
When this first started,

987
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:44,360
we were taking anybody
that was breathing.

988
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,488
If they had the down payment,
we would write them.

989
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:48,990
Our lenders basically said,

990
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:51,367
"You're selling subprime

991
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,661
to people that really can't
afford your product."

992
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,707
I was actually calling
in reference to your--

993
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,918
looks like you were set up
at the Westgate Town Center,

994
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:03,588
and your account's on the--
obviously it's on the default list.

995
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:05,131
I don't know if you were
having a hardship

996
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,507
or what happened, but...

997
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,890
...to see what we could do
and be able to help you out

998
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:18,102
with this dilemma
that you're going through.

999
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:25,735
One morning, everybody--

1000
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,821
we walk in and they gave us
the bad news.

1001
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,907
They had to let people go.

1002
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,742
Altogether,
with the nannies,

1003
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,661
there were 19 people.

1004
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:37,664
And now it's just--
with the nannies and myself,

1005
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:41,334
it's just four people,
and it's very difficult.

1006
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,760
The nannies
are working more now.

1007
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,804
They're working
around the clock.

1008
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,599
Okay, here's the school.

1009
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,102
We've cut back
everywhere we could.

1010
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,728
Hi. Hi, children.

1011
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,230
The kids were
in private school.

1012
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:04,691
They're now
in public school.

1013
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:07,360
Debbie, get in the back.

1014
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:09,946
- Have a nice day.
- Bye.

1015
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,915
- I don't know.
- I told them

1016
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,542
that they might have to go
to college now.

1017
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,503
They might have to actually
make their own money,

1018
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,755
and that's kind of like--

1019
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,008
I mean, they're realizing
that now,

1020
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:33,094
that there might not be
money there for them,

1021
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:35,138
you know?

1022
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:38,349
So I said, "Start thinking about what
you want to be when you grow up."

1023
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,027
Have you fed
the lizard here?

1024
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:51,070
No, 'cause nobody
takes me to the pet store.

1025
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,405
He hasn't eaten at all?

1026
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,991
Oh, I feel so bad
that he hasn't eaten.

1027
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:58,369
Well, I feel so bad nobody
takes me to the pet store.

1028
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,955
Look, he's starving.
Look, he doesn't even have water.

1029
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,958
Okay, but that's because
they never take me to the pet store.

1030
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,418
Like, I always ask
Marissa and Richard

1031
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:06,878
and they're like,
"No, I'm too busy."

1032
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:08,671
I'm going to go get
a piece of turkey.

1033
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:17,513
I can't believe you guys
don't feed the lizards.

1034
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,475
- He's not moving.
- He's not moving?

1035
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:22,268
I don't know
if he's dead.

1036
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:25,188
- Debbie.
- Did you kill him?

1037
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,106
You gotta give him water, too.

1038
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:30,026
Oh, you guys killed him.

1039
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,028
- What?
- You killed him.

1040
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:35,239
I know. I apologize for being
such a horrible person.

1041
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:38,201
Oh, Debbie.

1042
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:39,786
He's not my pet.

1043
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:42,914
David, look.

1044
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:45,041
He's dead.

1045
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:48,336
I didn't even know
we had a lizard.

1046
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:50,380
Nobody would take me
to the pet store ever.

1047
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,881
Well, he didn't
even have water.

1048
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,800
It's not like that would
have made a difference.

1049
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,676
Maybe he died
of dehydration.

1050
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:59,722
Oh, I apologize that
I'm a horrible person.

1051
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,265
I didn't say you're
a horrible person.

1052
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,893
Well, you're making me
feel like one.

1053
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:20,743
Yesterday he jumped right in.

1054
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:24,872
My father's first wife is my mother.

1055
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,875
They were married
in 1961

1056
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:31,796
and they divorced
in 1968.

1057
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:34,966
Now, my father was paying
my mother child support.

1058
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:39,762
But even when he had millions,
we were poor.

1059
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,347
I mean, I even
remember getting

1060
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:44,350
swamp cabbage for us
to eat for dinner.

1061
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:47,603
However, we were
the best-dressed kids at school,

1062
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,273
because every year my father
would give us money

1063
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:51,941
to go clothes shopping.

1064
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,609
So we always had
great clothes,

1065
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,028
but we had no money.

1066
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:59,824
Finally, my father called us
one day and he said,

1067
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:01,534
"Would you like
to come live with me?"

1068
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:04,162
That was in 1980.
And I said, "Yes."

1069
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,038
I didn't even think twice. "Yes!"

1070
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,540
That first year in Orlando

1071
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,459
was one of the best years
of my life.

1072
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,211
They had a housekeeper
and they had a cook

1073
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,880
and they got a chauffeur.

1074
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:15,756
They bought a limousine.

1075
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:18,634
That summer, before I went
into my junior year,

1076
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:24,015
my stepmother said,
"I've already raised my kids.

1077
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:26,684
I'm not going to worry
about your father's kids,

1078
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:30,438
so you all need
to move out."

1079
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:32,815
I never held a grudge
against my father

1080
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:36,068
because even though
I only lived with him for a year,

1081
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,321
he still paid for me
to go to boarding school,

1082
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:41,199
he still paid for my college
and gave me a car.

1083
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:44,744
My father and I aren't close
on a personal level

1084
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:46,787
because it's always been
a business relationship.

1085
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,248
When we talk,
it's all about business.

1086
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,335
We're father and son,
employer, employee,

1087
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:55,922
but we're not close.

1088
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:03,346
Work is my life 24/7,

1089
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:05,431
and I don't know
any other way to do it.

1090
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:10,811
I'm a victim of my own success
or failures.

1091
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:17,109
The company and myself
was the same thing.

1092
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:20,488
So whenever the company was
signing on the dotted line,

1093
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:23,074
they wanted my personal guarantee,
my signature.

1094
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:26,369
Fine. Everything I had
was in the company

1095
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:28,204
'cause I'd never taken
anything out of the company.

1096
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:42,176
Wendy, you're the only one working

1097
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,845
out of, like, 25 people.

1098
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:48,975
Okay, I guess
I'm the chef now.

1099
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:54,313
Okay, now what, Wendy?
Now, what's our next step?

1100
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,900
- Corn?
- Almost done-- it's done?

1101
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:03,948
No, he likes it, like, crispy.

1102
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:06,075
Hey, how was
the baseball game?

1103
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,077
I never
would have had so many children

1104
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,620
if I couldn't have a nanny.

1105
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:12,748
When I grew up, I didn't know
there was a such thing as a nanny.

1106
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,042
So I figured I'd probably
have one kid,

1107
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,836
and then maybe two.

1108
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:18,838
But then when I found out
I could have nannies,

1109
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:20,298
I just kept having
the kids.

1110
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:21,882
I mean, they're just
bundles ofjoy.

1111
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:25,428
Mama! Mama!

1112
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,930
- Come on.
- Come on, girls.

1113
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:32,184
Wendy, let's do it
like a proper dinner.

1114
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,104
Can we just sit together
like a nice family?

1115
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,689
- Okay.
- Okay.

1116
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:38,608
Fine.

1117
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,901
Right-- over there.

1118
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,403
Oh, they're crying.

1119
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:45,865
Just tell them
it's a princess party.

1120
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,957
Drew, come here.

1121
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,168
We're trying to get
Daddy's dinner ready.

1122
00:54:57,336 --> 00:55:00,171
We're gonna do a surprise
for Daddy's birthday.

1123
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:04,008
We need everyone.
It's Daddy's birthday.

1124
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:12,975
Okay, now could you
go get some plates

1125
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,895
and, like,
put them around?

1126
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:18,022
Hey, you found one?

1127
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,191
Found another one?

1128
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,327
Oh, is he home?

1129
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:33,537
Oh, the TV's on.

1130
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:36,290
- You just noticed?
- Yeah.

1131
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:39,335
Hurry up, Dad.

1132
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,965
Hey, honey.
How long till you're ready?

1133
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:47,176
- Ready for what?
- To come out.

1134
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,428
I'm not coming out.
I've got work to do.

1135
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,305
What do you mean
come out?

1136
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,182
Turn the bathroom
light out.

1137
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,310
Please stay tuned for
a message from our tyrannical dictator!

1138
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,085
Daddy's going to be
in a better mood

1139
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:22,962
in a couple of minutes.

1140
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,756
- Time-out.
- But you touched it.

1141
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,968
I hope Daddy's coming.

1142
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:36,767
Let me go wash
my dirty, filthy hands--

1143
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:40,938
ooh, so I can sit on
that dirty, filthy seat.

1144
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,773
Yuck!

1145
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:48,738
Why is this night different
than any other night?

1146
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,906
'Cause we eat
at the table.

1147
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:55,077
Nobody is crazy enough

1148
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:58,914
to build a building that size
and that expensive

1149
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:03,377
unless they have
a guaranteed market.

1150
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:06,422
They just think they're doing us a favor
by letting us be there.

1151
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,048
They don't seem
to understand.

1152
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:12,762
♪ Happy birthday
to you... ♪

1153
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,889
By not taking any money off the table,

1154
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:17,516
I'm at the mercy
of the bankers.

1155
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:20,186
They say, "Jump,"
and I say, "How high?"

1156
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:21,687
No, no.
No, no.

1157
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,773
I think he's humbled.

1158
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,566
My husband's humbled,

1159
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:29,278
which I kind of...

1160
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,447
like it, actually.

1161
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:34,074
What would you wish for

1162
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:37,953
in the last 25 years
of your life?

1163
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:41,040
Besides me, of course.

1164
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:46,337
If I have to live
to 150, that's what I'll do.

1165
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:48,464
You know, if that's
what it's gonna take

1166
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:51,175
to get back on top again.

1167
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:53,803
Those aren't edible candles.

1168
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:11,320
Right now I just
need to sell it.

1169
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,989
And, you know, there's not
too many buyers

1170
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:18,953
for 90,000-square-foot houses

1171
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,080
at that price.

1172
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,875
Oh, my God.

1173
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:27,878
Aw. I just want one picture.

1174
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:30,005
Can you take a picture
with my cell phone?

1175
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:34,343
This was going to be in our spa
in our big house.

1176
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:39,014
David's barber chair.
It's a beautiful chair, isn't it?

1177
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:42,017
I picked out so much stuff
over the years,

1178
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,562
it's, like, been 10 years
in progress.

1179
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:46,730
The majority of it
is probably French

1180
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:49,024
to go with the theme
of Versailles.

1181
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,944
These things over here
is all from the genie bottle

1182
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:54,405
from the Aladdin Hotel,
right here.

1183
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:58,200
What do you call it--
the eggs from Russia?

1184
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,202
Fabergé eggs.

1185
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,581
But look,
I got the giant ones.

1186
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:06,417
If we do sell the house,
then we probably would auction it off,

1187
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:08,919
but we're going to wait
and see what happens.

1188
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,671
You know,
I'm fine with it.

1189
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:13,340
I married David
for richer or poorer.

1190
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:18,053
And if we-- I want to use
some of the antiques now,

1191
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:22,725
so I'm kind of picking
some smaller pieces

1192
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:26,061
that could fit
into our current home.

1193
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,230
I know there's, like,
a superior source

1194
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:31,734
or something that's guiding us
in the right way.

1195
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:37,197
David, Daniel,
could you help me

1196
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:39,742
get some of your old toys
that you don't want anymore

1197
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,994
so I can donate it?

1198
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:44,538
How about stuff like this?

1199
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,123
I mean, are you guys
using this backpack?

1200
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:48,083
No.
That's a backpack?

1201
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,669
What time
is it now?

1202
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,963
Well, if I could
afford a watch,

1203
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,465
I would tell you.

1204
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:58,302
Wow, but you can afford
that jacket and your iPhone.

1205
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,474
Daniel:

1206
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:05,726
I hope it's not doggie caca.

1207
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:08,646
- Ew! Is it?
- Yeah.

1208
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:11,732
That's why I hate
having so many dogs.

1209
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,151
I've been up and down
my entire life.

1210
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:17,279
I mean, I've been
married before

1211
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,073
and I didn't have to worry
about anything.

1212
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,741
I was making tons
of money modeling,

1213
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:23,118
and then I was poor again.

1214
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:24,745
I've been a cocktail waitress.

1215
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:26,956
I mean, I even--
in the nursing home,

1216
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,749
I used to clean dead people

1217
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:31,251
and prepare them
for the morgue.

1218
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:34,046
For $3.35 an hour.

1219
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:38,342
This building
used to be an old--

1220
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:40,260
like a Home Depot-type of store.

1221
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,137
My husband bought it
years ago,

1222
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:45,015
so I thought this would be
a perfect opportunity.

1223
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:49,269
I could raise money that I could
give back to the community.

1224
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:52,731
I bought some of the inventory
from hotels and stuff,

1225
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,984
like the old microwaves
and things like that.

1226
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:58,028
And we get donations.

1227
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:00,531
All this and this over here

1228
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:03,325
is my personal stuff
from the house.

1229
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,035
It's the stuff
that I've donated.

1230
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:07,746
With the bankers
just not funding

1231
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,832
the company anymore,

1232
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,501
we were forced
to lay off 6,000 people.

1233
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,503
The bankers
made us do it, so--

1234
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,588
they're probably going
to get mad at me for saying that,

1235
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:19,925
but that's what I heard
and that's what I understand.

1236
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,846
Most of the people here
are Westgate employees.

1237
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:26,682
I just felt it was a way
that I could really do something

1238
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,600
to help people
in a desperate situation

1239
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,185
that don't deserve
to be there.

1240
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,603
$30 brand-new.

1241
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:34,565
We got them from the same vendor
that Macy's gets them from.

1242
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:36,692
$79.99 at Macy's.

1243
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:39,403
Here's my dressing rooms.

1244
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:41,613
Should I put curtains up or not?

1245
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:43,532
Orjust leave them like that?

1246
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,243
Yeah, curtains?

1247
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:49,371
I have evolved

1248
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:53,250
from being someone
who just went out

1249
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:54,877
to charity lunches
all the time

1250
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:58,047
and went shopping to wear something
to the charity lunches

1251
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:02,134
to actually doing
something more in my life

1252
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:03,844
to make a difference.

1253
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,055
Hey, Tina.

1254
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:07,848
Hi. How are you?

1255
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:10,184
Good. I haven't talked
to you in a little bit.

1256
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:12,394
I know.
It's been a while.

1257
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:16,023
But, hey, that money
I sent you,

1258
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:18,275
was it able to save
your house?

1259
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:20,319
No, no, it was not.

1260
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:22,071
It didn't save
your house?

1261
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:26,241
No, I-- I talked
to the mortgage company

1262
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,910
and, you know,
I was all excited,

1263
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:29,578

1264
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,413
that you told me
I needed to pay you."

1265
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,583
They run it through
their system or whatever

1266
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,878
and he says, "Nope, sorry,
they won't-- they won't take that."

1267
01:02:38,046 --> 01:02:39,505
Oh, my God.

1268
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:42,841
And I only owed them
$1 ,700 to begin with.

1269
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,426
Unbelievable.

1270
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:47,096
So, you actually lost
the house?

1271
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,597
Well, it's in foreclosure.

1272
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,600
They're not going to let me
stop the foreclosure.

1273
01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:11,578
Jackie's a friend.

1274
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:13,622
They help me
with a lot of things.

1275
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,165
You know, occasionally
I have a wedding

1276
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,084
that somebody wants
a Rolls-Royce,

1277
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:20,170
and I'll borrow that
so the bride can go

1278
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:23,382
to and from the church
in a Rolls-Royce.

1279
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,968
My wife's working
double shifts

1280
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:29,596
and I'm doing as much
driving as I can.

1281
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:32,975
We didn't even put
our tree up yet.

1282
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:34,643
I got into
the limousine business

1283
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,646
when I saw that real estate
wasn't doing that well.

1284
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,233
And that's the only thing
that kept us afloat.

1285
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:42,860
I had a good job
in New York.

1286
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:45,779
I worked for a commercial
real estate company.

1287
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,992
We moved down here

1288
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,244
for a better life
for the kids,

1289
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:54,496
and you try to keep going
and make more money

1290
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,915
and buy more houses.

1291
01:03:57,083 --> 01:04:00,210
Altogether,
we had about 19 houses.

1292
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:03,839
My net worth?
Probably about 3 1/2 million.

1293
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:05,799
Now zero.

1294
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:12,514
Everything changes.

1295
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:18,604
Within a month after
the bankruptcy court was finalized,

1296
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:20,731
the lawyer told me we had
to be out of the house.

1297
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:22,816
And then we moved in here.

1298
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:25,194
My friend's rental.

1299
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:27,070
It happens pretty fast,

1300
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:29,781
but, you know,
you survive.

1301
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,700
Hi, Tom.

1302
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,493
Did you get a donut?

1303
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:35,871
It's hard going back
to renting.

1304
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:38,749
- No?
- Yeah, I got one.

1305
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:40,792
You can see there's
nothing on the walls,

1306
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,879
so it doesn't really feel
like it's your house.

1307
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:46,340
It humbles you a lot.

1308
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:49,384
Our family and health
and the kids

1309
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:52,721
are the most important thing,
and friends.

1310
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,224
You know, you can get by
without owning a house.

1311
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:58,602
You can't get by without
friends and family.

1312
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:01,063
You know, that's the most
important things.

1313
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:08,153
This is my palace.

1314
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,906
This used to be
the twins' playhouse,

1315
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:13,742
but they don't use it,
so I use it.

1316
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,745
Yeah, and it's good
to have this.

1317
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,748
Like when it's too noisy
in there,

1318
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,917
just run here, quiet.

1319
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:24,294
I asked Jackie
if I can use it,

1320
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:27,422
and then she said,
"Are you serious?"

1321
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:28,924
Yes, I am.

1322
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:30,509
This is the bed.

1323
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:34,429
I'm using this,
but then I folded it,

1324
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,932
because when you get in,
it's all over here.

1325
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,768
You cannot-- you cannot
get in-- through.

1326
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,687
I love this place.

1327
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:44,523
And I'm so glad
Jackie gave it to me.

1328
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:54,241
I promised him before I left
that I'm gonna have money,

1329
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:57,786
then we can do that--
we can build our own house.

1330
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:01,540
Before that happened,
he passed away.

1331
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:05,294
I'm supporting
not just my children--

1332
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:06,962
my brothers, my sisters.

1333
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,840
All the money
that I have is--

1334
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:11,550
I'm sending it to them.

1335
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:29,735
So maybe that's
still good for him.

1336
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:51,173
David Siegel said, "Do not
touch anything in that room.

1337
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:54,343
I don't want a chair, a table,
a copier, a computer--

1338
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,969
I don't want anything taken out

1339
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:58,138
'cause we will be reopening."

1340
01:06:58,306 --> 01:07:00,682
And here we are
seven months later.

1341
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,060
Everything has stayed
the same.

1342
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:06,480
Well, this was my office.
I wish I could turn on the lights,

1343
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:09,024
but they shut them off
to save money, I guess.

1344
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:11,234
The lenders kept
trying to get us

1345
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:14,279
to stop sales on the building,
which we wouldn't do.

1346
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,573
And finally,
they were so mad

1347
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,867
that he kept doing it
when they said not to

1348
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,410
that they laid the law down

1349
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:24,164
and we had to stop sales
of this building.

1350
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:27,209
This is where we sold at least
$100 million a year.

1351
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:29,211
And we could do
up to $200 million a year.

1352
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:31,380
And now it's just empty.

1353
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:36,676
The reason that
they wanted us to stop sales

1354
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:39,471
is that they wanted us
not to pay them

1355
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:41,556
so that they could go
and foreclose on the building,

1356
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,392
which they have already done.

1357
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:50,440
I almost feel like
the bankers

1358
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:52,734
are like vultures,
like, circling around,

1359
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,236
waiting for the animal to die

1360
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:59,241
instead of helping out
the situation.

1361
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:00,867
No one knows that this building

1362
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:02,369
is being foreclosed upon.

1363
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:04,788
If our owners found out,

1364
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:07,290
we would have a mass exodus
in our hands.

1365
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:09,751
They would be stopping payments.

1366
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:12,212
All of our people
in our company are paid

1367
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,713
by those monthly payments.

1368
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:16,425
So we live and die
by those monthly payments.

1369
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:24,182
I really don't understand
the financial community,

1370
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:27,519
especially when they get
all that money from the government.

1371
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:30,814
I thought that that rescue money
two years ago

1372
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:36,069
in September of 2008

1373
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:38,947
was supposed to go--
be passed on

1374
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:42,701
to the common people
or, you know, us.

1375
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:53,753
She knows we need to cut back,

1376
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:56,548
but it's difficult for her.

1377
01:08:56,716 --> 01:08:59,009
She's still compulsive.

1378
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:02,179
Where she slows down
one activity,

1379
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:05,390
she accelerates another one.

1380
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:10,020
My husband all the time
tells me not to spend money.

1381
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:11,605
He says if I keep spending,

1382
01:09:11,772 --> 01:09:14,274
then he's going to shut
my credit cards off

1383
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:16,234
orjust not pay them.

1384
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:18,612
And he says he might not have
the money to pay them anyway,

1385
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:22,240
so it might not be
either/or choices.

1386
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:25,744
Wait, wait, wait.
I got Daniel.

1387
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:28,330
Daniel needs a ramp,
not that one.

1388
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:29,998
He doesn't need this.

1389
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,209
No, I need the--
all the perfume and stuff

1390
01:09:32,376 --> 01:09:33,835
for the stocking stuffers.

1391
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:37,672
The boys like this
for the stockings.

1392
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:40,425
For Bear.

1393
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:42,052
You know how Bear
likes to walk around

1394
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,221
with something
in his mouth.

1395
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:46,723
You're taking
everything out.

1396
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:54,064
- It's too much.
- I know.

1397
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:08,036
My wife collects everything.

1398
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:10,747
She can't have one bird,
she's got to have a dozen.

1399
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:13,208
Can't have one dog,
she's got to have a dozen.

1400
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:16,711
Can't have one child,
she's got to have seven.

1401
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,213
So...

1402
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:19,881
what can I tell you?

1403
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:23,134
Whew.
Oh, my Lord.

1404
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,263
- Come on.
- Okay.

1405
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:28,557
Excuse me, get down.

1406
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:30,100
Oh, shit.

1407
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:32,143
- It's okay.
- Yeah, that's for Drew.

1408
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:33,895
Yes.

1409
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,855
That's too small.

1410
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,533
Oh, gosh.

1411
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:15,270
I can't believe we don't
have a bartender.

1412
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:17,606
Mr. Siegel, you need
a bartender tonight?

1413
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:20,317
Then who's coming over
to serve the food?

1414
01:11:20,484 --> 01:11:22,944
- Is there any bartender?
- No.

1415
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:24,279
- How do you do?
- Good, thank you.

1416
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:25,447
- Seneel?
- Teneel.

1417
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:26,531
Teneel, okay.

1418
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:29,117
Get everything
organized here.

1419
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:32,037
Honey, we've got people
coming and you're not even ready.

1420
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:33,538
They're arriving.

1421
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:35,749
- Well, give me five minutes, then.
- Hurry up.

1422
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:40,295
I don't want David
to buy me any Christmas presents.

1423
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:41,588
I don't need it.

1424
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:43,465
All I want is,
you know, just for us

1425
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:45,925
to be happy together,
get along,

1426
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:48,178
and I want to see
our family and our friends

1427
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:49,554
with smiles
on their faces.

1428
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,806
- Oh, my God!
- How are you?

1429
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:56,936
Nothing makes me happy
these days.

1430
01:11:57,104 --> 01:12:01,483
I'll be happy when I find
a solution to this.

1431
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:07,906
I can't separate business
from personal.

1432
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:12,535
And here is the hostess
with the two mostest.

1433
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:14,162
- Here's Grandma.
- A great present for Jett.

1434
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,331
- Here's Grandma!
- Grandma!

1435
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:18,667
Oh, he's huge!
Jett!

1436
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:21,211
Give Grandma
hugs and kisses.

1437
01:12:21,379 --> 01:12:23,755
If I could have
anything that I want for Christmas,

1438
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:26,549
I would say $300 million

1439
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:28,885
to take care
of what we have in Vegas,

1440
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:30,553
and I will be just fine after that.

1441
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:32,722
Marissa, you need to put
the Rudolph costume on.

1442
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:34,015
Here, I'll come
help you.

1443
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:35,183
- Come on.
- Okay.

1444
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:36,726
- We got to hurry.
- I need china.

1445
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:38,687
Everyone's arriving.

1446
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:41,356
I don't know why
they didn't set up a bar.

1447
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:44,943
No, no, no, no.

1448
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:46,945
All right, should I send
my mom in here and help?

1449
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:48,863
Because I got to go get
some Christmas presents.

1450
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:51,866
I have to just--
I don't need help.

1451
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,368
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1452
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:55,036
All right, 'cause I got
too much to do.

1453
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,747
- I don't have enough help.
- This is a pain in the ass.

1454
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:02,293
I really miss
having a manager

1455
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:04,087
that does
all this stuff for me.

1456
01:13:08,008 --> 01:13:09,718
All right.

1457
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,723
Let me just--

1458
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:18,309
Okay, let me just open it.

1459
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:21,855
♪ Rudolph the red-nosed
reindeer ♪

1460
01:13:22,022 --> 01:13:25,400
♪ Had a very shiny nose ♪

1461
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:28,737
♪ And if you ever saw it ♪

1462
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:31,281
♪ You could even say it glows. ♪

1463
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:32,866
Merry Christmas!

1464
01:13:33,033 --> 01:13:34,743
Merry Christmas.

1465
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:38,455
- Hi.
- Merry Christmas.

1466
01:13:38,622 --> 01:13:40,248
- Hi.
- Hi.

1467
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,711
Oh, Rudolph is here!

1468
01:13:44,879 --> 01:13:47,756
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer.

1469
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:52,218
- You got the key to my Rolls?
- No.

1470
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:55,221
- Did you drive it?
- Yeah, I brought it in

1471
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:57,265
and personally
handed it to Jackie.

1472
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:58,808
I don't know--
I don't--

1473
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:01,269
then they came back in
and they said the lights were on.

1474
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,188
Yeah, and I went back out.
I turned them out.

1475
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:04,939
I never saw the key again.

1476
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:07,317
- Did you use it?
- Yeah.

1477
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:08,902
Yeah, we did a quick wedding.

1478
01:14:09,069 --> 01:14:11,196
- Did I get paid?
- Absolutely.

1479
01:14:11,363 --> 01:14:13,740
- Who'd you give the money to?
- Jackie.

1480
01:14:13,908 --> 01:14:16,284
You didn't give--
I never saw the money.

1481
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:19,829
- It's where the key is.
- I never saw the money.

1482
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:22,540
Well, no, it always
drifts off now

1483
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:25,293
at this time of year and stuff,
but it'll pick up and stuff.

1484
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,504
- Must've been tricky, yeah.
- We're going to sell David's house.

1485
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:29,631
- Everything will be fabulous.
- Tricky couple of years.

1486
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:34,886
Now the loan comes due.

1487
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:37,180
I'll pay you the interest
like I'm doing now.

1488
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:38,473
And they said, "No."

1489
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:42,393
So now I send
a third party to go see

1490
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:46,564
how much they'll sell
that loan for.

1491
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:48,817
They wrote it down-- 11.

1492
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:51,736
They sold the loan
to the third party.

1493
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:53,613
They didn't know
I was involved.

1494
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:56,115
$3.2 million.

1495
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:58,159
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, I'm getting it back.

1496
01:14:58,327 --> 01:14:59,828
What a bunch of idiots.

1497
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:02,664
So I'm going from
owing 18 million...

1498
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:05,708
...for 3.2 million.

1499
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:09,546
- I mean, that's--
- That's why banks are in trouble.

1500
01:15:09,713 --> 01:15:11,798
Who the hell's making those--
I mean, I'm glad they did,

1501
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:13,508
but who's making
those decisions?

1502
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:15,593
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

1503
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:18,471
Merry Christmas.

1504
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:19,973
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

1505
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:22,392
Honey, let's go.
Everybody out.

1506
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,769
- It's, you know--
- All right.

1507
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:27,939
It's almost--
it's getting late.

1508
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:31,025
I love the BB.

1509
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:33,361
I love you.

1510
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:36,030
Merry Christmas.

1511
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:37,824
Okay, that's enough.

1512
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:43,997
Our life is definitely
more challenging today

1513
01:15:44,164 --> 01:15:46,207
than when we first
got married.

1514
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:50,128
I try to put blinders on

1515
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:54,340
and do my thing,
but it's there.

1516
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:56,593
Okay, Merry Christmas,

1517
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,470
and we'll see you
in the morning.

1518
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:03,558
The stress
has actually made us closer, stronger.

1519
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:05,351
And I think,
you know what they say--

1520
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:07,228
when you're down
is when you find out

1521
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,898
who your true friends are.

1522
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:35,423
Where's all the kids
clamoring for their toys?

1523
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:40,219
Where should I put these?

1524
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:41,721
Next to Daddy.

1525
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:44,599
Wait, I lost BB's puppies.

1526
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:48,394
I need to find it because
the python will eat them,

1527
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:50,438
eat the puppies.

1528
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,106
Oh, my God.

1529
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:55,860
- Are her puppies lost?
- Uh, yeah.

1530
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:59,530
Puppies!

1531
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:01,616
- Jonquil.
- Huh?

1532
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:04,994
Since it's your snake
going around the house,

1533
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:06,663
can you help me
find the puppies?

1534
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:09,207
All right,
I'll look for them.

1535
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:12,335
Do you get strength
from your marriage?

1536
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:15,380
No.

1537
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:19,842
Not really.

1538
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:24,222
I-- it's kind of like

1539
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:27,183
having another child.

1540
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:29,102
Oh, I found it.

1541
01:17:29,269 --> 01:17:30,812
- Look.
- Both?

1542
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:34,732
Oh, my God, they're like trapped
in the corner here.

1543
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,735
I think they're scared.

1544
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:39,570
I don't know where
to pile my presents.

1545
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:41,406
Here, I'll help.

1546
01:17:41,573 --> 01:17:42,740
I'm putting mine over here.

1547
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:44,993
Maybe you can put yours
right in the center.

1548
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:48,121
- I showed Daddy.
- I got the crystal growing thing.

1549
01:17:48,288 --> 01:17:50,039
When I lived in New York

1550
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,874
and I would see
rich people on TV,

1551
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:54,210
I'd be like, "Wow, you know,
their lifestyle must be nice.

1552
01:17:54,378 --> 01:17:55,753
Like, if I lived
that lifestyle,

1553
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:58,047
I would just wake up every day
with a smile on my face."

1554
01:17:58,215 --> 01:18:00,842
But now that I do,
it's like I wake up now,

1555
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,552
and it's just--
I'm used to it.

1556
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,345
And then it's like
you want more and more.

1557
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,639
I got another Yahtzee.

1558
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,350
I got another baby doll.

1559
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:11,978
Good morning, Victoria.
Merry Christmas.

1560
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:14,105
Merry Christmas to you, too.

1561
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:20,361
I got... Monopoly?

1562
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,530
What am I going to do
with Monopoly?

1563
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:25,033
Well, actually, I gave you these gifts
like five years ago,

1564
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,534
but the kids were too young

1565
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:28,202
for you to play with,
so I'm regifting.

1566
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:32,248
- 'Cause you never opened it.
- Risk? What's Risk?

1567
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:33,750
That's a great game.

1568
01:18:33,917 --> 01:18:35,251
That's when you
take over the world.

1569
01:18:35,419 --> 01:18:37,879
We're not the typical family,

1570
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:39,630
that's for sure.

1571
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:42,842
And, I mean,
I don't want you

1572
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:47,305
to get the impression
that we're penniless,

1573
01:18:47,473 --> 01:18:50,933
but we're going through
a very difficult time.

1574
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:56,439
Our lenders-- I mean,
they have cut my paycheck.

1575
01:18:56,607 --> 01:18:59,776
My CFO said,
"Well, that's not enough

1576
01:18:59,943 --> 01:19:02,028
for him to make
his mortgage payments on."

1577
01:19:02,196 --> 01:19:04,405
And so one of them
lenders said,

1578
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:06,574
"Well, then, let him move
into an apartment."

1579
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:09,160
Look what I got.
It's a present to myself.

1580
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:12,789
Oh, I just can't wait
to eat my caviar.

1581
01:19:12,956 --> 01:19:14,749
How much is this?
Like $2,000?

1582
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:17,418
I don't even know.
Aw, this tastes so good.

1583
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:19,545
Whoever got you
that is going to get fired,

1584
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:22,632
I'll tell you that.

1585
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:26,344
If the company fails,
they may have to go to work

1586
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:28,262
and not be able
to go to college

1587
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,515
or get a college loan.

1588
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:34,393
No, I haven't done--
put anything aside.

1589
01:19:35,813 --> 01:19:39,440
This is for my mother,
who isn't here today.

1590
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,359
When your grandmother
was on her honeymoon,

1591
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:43,861
she was on a train
going to Chicago,

1592
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:46,280
and she asked my father

1593
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,241
if he would buy her
the Hershey bar.

1594
01:19:48,408 --> 01:19:50,284
And he said,
"I don't have a nickel."

1595
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:54,747
And so ever since,
every birthday,

1596
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:56,707
I got her a Hershey bar.

1597
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:58,835
She said, "If she's not
here to eat it,

1598
01:19:59,002 --> 01:20:00,336
I should eat it for her."

1599
01:20:00,504 --> 01:20:03,339
So I'm gonna eat it for her.

1600
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:05,007
Thank you, Mom.

1601
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:14,267
On my wedding day,
my father gave a speech,

1602
01:20:14,434 --> 01:20:17,061
and he looked at my wife
and he said,

1603
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:19,147
"You will never have anything

1604
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:21,858
to worry about in your life."

1605
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:24,318
We worry every day.

1606
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:28,656
Everyone in this company
has had not one pay cut--

1607
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,992
two pay cuts,
three pay cuts.

1608
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,618
We've all taken big hits.

1609
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:36,873
I went to him last week
about money.

1610
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,041
"You have to give me
some money.

1611
01:20:39,209 --> 01:20:40,585
I need money."

1612
01:20:40,752 --> 01:20:43,671
And he said, "I would
give it to you if I had it.

1613
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:45,882
I can't give you anything."

1614
01:20:46,049 --> 01:20:49,010
So right now, I'm applying
for a home equity loan

1615
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:51,345
and I just upped
all the limits

1616
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:53,639
on all my credit cards.

1617
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:58,060
Vegas is what's causing
our big problem.

1618
01:20:58,228 --> 01:21:01,480
And the bank's answer
to a solution is,

1619
01:21:01,648 --> 01:21:04,942
"Just hand us the keys
and give up

1620
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:07,653
the 390 million
that you put in it."

1621
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:10,031
And my answer is,

1622
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:12,116
"Over my dead body."

1623
01:21:13,452 --> 01:21:15,328
I mean, he told me,
"I'm not giving it up.

1624
01:21:15,495 --> 01:21:16,954
If I have to bankrupt it,
I'll bankrupt it."

1625
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:18,623
That's what David
said to me, too.

1626
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:21,334
And then Michael
said today,

1627
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:23,044
"Your dad's gonna
go down with the ship."

1628
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:24,212
The ship's not going down.

1629
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:26,881
He bankrupts that, they're gonna stop
funding the rest of the company

1630
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:28,591
- and the company goes.
- No, they won't.

1631
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:31,135
- They have too much to lose.
- That's correct.

1632
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:34,388
This building
is much more important

1633
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:37,391
than building the largest house
in America.

1634
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:39,602
He has built the largest

1635
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:41,312
time-share company
in the world,

1636
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:44,065
and this is
the pinnacle of it.

1637
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:48,527
It'd be a real shame,
though, to actually lose it.

1638
01:21:48,695 --> 01:21:52,240
If they use
every method they can

1639
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,200
to try to get
the building back,

1640
01:21:54,368 --> 01:21:56,160
then at the 11th hour

1641
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:58,788
I bankrupt it and buy time.

1642
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:01,999
Time is...

1643
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:05,044
what I need.

1644
01:22:05,212 --> 01:22:08,464
If he throws this building
into bankruptcy,

1645
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:10,883
then he risks
the rest of the company

1646
01:22:11,051 --> 01:22:13,594
because our lenders
are financing

1647
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:15,388
the rest of the company.

1648
01:22:15,555 --> 01:22:18,224
They have made it
very clear to my father

1649
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:21,769
that if he turns over
the keys to the building,

1650
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:25,356
that his company
would become a cash cow.

1651
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:27,275
They would continue
to finance it.

1652
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:29,318
He wouldn't have to worry
about anything

1653
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:31,570
and he would go back
to life as normal.

1654
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:32,822
He can go back
to building his house,

1655
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:35,574
flying in his plane,
buying other resorts.

1656
01:22:35,742 --> 01:22:37,576
He'll have more money
than he knows what to do with

1657
01:22:37,744 --> 01:22:40,454
if he turns over this building.

1658
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:43,165
Everyone is against him

1659
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:44,959
trying to keep this building.

1660
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:47,086
I've had arguments
with my own brother

1661
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:48,963
who screamed
and yelled at me,

1662
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:50,464
"What are you doing
to this family?

1663
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:51,757
What are you doing
to this company?

1664
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:53,009
How can you support him?"

1665
01:22:53,176 --> 01:22:55,303
All of his people--
his attorney,

1666
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:57,305
his closest friends,
his executives--

1667
01:22:57,472 --> 01:22:58,973
all turning
against him.

1668
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:01,684
He's the one that made
a lot of people a lot of money.

1669
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:04,478
If he says he's going to continue
to try to keep this project,

1670
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,188
then I'm going to continue
to support him.

1671
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:10,318
And right now, him and I
are the only ones standing alone.

1672
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:16,991
It's amazing.

1673
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:20,161
I think when you first
started filming this,

1674
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:22,163
we were on top
of the world,

1675
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:25,499
building the largest home
in America.

1676
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:27,418
Everything was wonderful,

1677
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:30,421
no worries in the world.

1678
01:23:30,589 --> 01:23:34,842
If I remember, you said
why am I building that large home?

1679
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:38,179
And I think I said,
"Because I can."

1680
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:42,808
A lot of things have changed
in the last two years.

1681
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:46,812
So this is kind of like
a reverse

1682
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:49,357
of a rags-to-riches story.

1683
01:23:49,524 --> 01:23:52,568
This is almost like
a riches-to-rags story.

1684
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:57,365
Okay, no more texting.

1685
01:23:57,532 --> 01:23:59,075
Hello?

1686
01:23:59,242 --> 01:24:00,993
Oh, Jackie.

1687
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:02,495
I'm good.
I'm at the doctor's.

1688
01:24:02,662 --> 01:24:03,829
Tell them you'll
call them back.

1689
01:24:03,997 --> 01:24:07,124
Let me give you my--
well, okay, I'll call you.

1690
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:16,175
Okay.

1691
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:25,393
- Got it?
- Yeah.

1692
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,728
Raise the brows again
and then relax them.

1693
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:30,898
- Okay, so we're just gonna go--
- Ooh.

1694
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:32,400
A little injection.

1695
01:24:32,567 --> 01:24:34,568
Good, there we go.

1696
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:36,070
It's kind of embarrassing

1697
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:38,322
for people to see me
looking like this.

1698
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:41,659
I was just going
to go and hide

1699
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:43,744
in the bedroom
for a few days.

1700
01:24:45,455 --> 01:24:47,873
I'm having a hot flash
right now.

1701
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:49,959
My face is burning.

1702
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:56,132
Debbie,
you got a winner.

1703
01:24:56,299 --> 01:24:57,800
It's a buck.

1704
01:24:57,968 --> 01:24:59,635
Well, a dollar
is better than nothing.

1705
01:24:59,803 --> 01:25:01,470
Oh, I'm teaching my kids
how to gamble.

1706
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:04,265
- That's terrible at such a young age.
- It's not gambling.

1707
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:06,767
- This is gambling, Debbie.
- It's scratching off tickets.

1708
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:08,853
- Huh?
- It's scratching off tickets.

1709
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:11,063
It's gambling that
you're going to win.

1710
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:13,065
Usually, you lose.

1711
01:25:17,571 --> 01:25:20,030
So, what do you think?
I don't know.

1712
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:21,782
- Do you--
- Come on.

1713
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:26,620
Maybe I should go with the zebra
instead of cheetah.

1714
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:27,997
- Good.
- What do you think, honey?

1715
01:25:28,165 --> 01:25:30,499
I-- I love it.

1716
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:35,713
BB!

1717
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:39,884
You know, "If it ain't broken,

1718
01:25:40,051 --> 01:25:41,802
don't fix it" is my motto.

1719
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,888
- But it was broken.
- It wasn't broken.

1720
01:25:44,055 --> 01:25:45,723
- I don't want to kiss you.
- You told me--

1721
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:47,600
I don't want to kiss
some old hag.

1722
01:25:47,767 --> 01:25:49,643
You told me
when I turned 40,

1723
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:52,396
you'd trade me in
for two 20-years-old.

1724
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:54,190
And because I had
the Fraxel--

1725
01:25:54,357 --> 01:25:56,984
I'm waiting for you to be 60
so I can get three 20s.

1726
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:05,159
I got some good prospects
for getting some money.

1727
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:12,124
It would probably be
my greatest achievement--

1728
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:16,170
besides having all these
beautiful children--

1729
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:20,674
would be finding the money.

1730
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:22,343
I'm on a quest.

1731
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:25,221
I want to spend
all that money...

1732
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:31,852
that I'm going
to make in Vegas.

1733
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:38,901
I'm going to buy
my yacht and my plane.

1734
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:45,824
But you can't--
never get back

1735
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:48,994
the two years
that I've lost looking.

1736
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:50,871
I feel like--
almost like a guy

1737
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:52,873
who is in jail
for a couple years.

1738
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:54,792
You know, you never
get that back.

1739
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,921
The big house-- you know,
I really don't want to sell it,

1740
01:26:59,089 --> 01:27:02,049
so I don't care
if I haven't had any bites.

1741
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:04,176
I want to really finish it.

1742
01:27:05,554 --> 01:27:08,138
If I don't sell it, I'll keep it,

1743
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:09,640
finish it.

1744
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:11,141
Right, BB?

1745
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:13,978
We're going to go live
in there someday, aren't we?

1746
01:27:14,145 --> 01:27:15,688
Hmm?

1747
01:27:15,855 --> 01:27:19,066
I'll live there and Jackie
can stay here, okay?

1748
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:21,443
Just you and I
in that big house.

1749
01:27:21,611 --> 01:27:25,281
How about that, BB, huh?
Just you and me.

1750
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:38,752
Every light in the house is on.

1751
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,088
- I don't know.
- I've noticed that my dad's been

1752
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,591
a lot more stressed out lately.

1753
01:27:43,758 --> 01:27:45,843
I never really
spend time with him.

1754
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:47,928
Maybe you ought to go
look in my office

1755
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:51,181
and see all the crap
that's on the floor in there.

1756
01:27:51,349 --> 01:27:53,183
Versailles...

1757
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:59,940
is in default
with the bank.

1758
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:01,442
What does that mean?

1759
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:05,779
It means that
they started foreclosure.

1760
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:10,492
But we'll work it out
before we lose it.

1761
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:13,162
We'll figure out
a way to keep it.

1762
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:21,879
So, do you want to have
dinner in the kitchen

1763
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:23,797
or you want to have
dinner in here, honey?

1764
01:28:27,761 --> 01:28:30,054
Why are you in
such a bad mood?

1765
01:28:30,221 --> 01:28:31,555
I mean, all of a sudden,

1766
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:33,015
I talked about it this--

1767
01:28:34,517 --> 01:28:36,894
I talked about it
this morning and--

1768
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:41,023
Is it 'cause the front door
was open when you came home?

1769
01:28:41,191 --> 01:28:43,150
No, no.
You know what?

1770
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:44,652
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna not pay

1771
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:46,153
the electric bill this month.

1772
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:47,696
When they shut off the lights,

1773
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:50,866
then you'll all
appreciate electricity.

1774
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:58,499
- Um--
- You all take everything for granted.

1775
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:00,918
I didn't know
the front door was open.

1776
01:29:01,086 --> 01:29:03,045
Honey, maybe you need
to get a better,

1777
01:29:03,213 --> 01:29:04,755
like, hinge on the front door.

1778
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:07,257
Maybe you should become
aware of your surroundings.

1779
01:29:07,425 --> 01:29:10,302
Well, we have, like,
a hundred doors in this house.

1780
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:13,180
You didn't know all the lights
were on either.

1781
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:15,057
They weren't all on.

1782
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:21,271
All right, I'm--
I'm helping Victoria, um--

1783
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:24,525
I'm teaching her how to make,
like, the shepherd's pie.

1784
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:27,319
Do you mind
if I do that with her?

1785
01:29:27,487 --> 01:29:31,198
- Can I at least have a kiss?
- No.

1786
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:34,535
You're mad at me
just from the front door?

1787
01:29:36,996 --> 01:29:38,706
All right.

1788
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,463
Here, I'm going
to help you make

1789
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:48,924
that shepherd's pie,
Victoria.

1790
01:29:49,092 --> 01:29:51,385
I-- why are you
going in there?

1791
01:30:02,856 --> 01:30:06,024
Why don't you learn
to turn off the lights?

1792
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:08,360
Um, I was upstairs
in my room the whole time.

1793
01:30:08,528 --> 01:30:11,822
How would you like
to live without electricity?

1794
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:14,742
I was in my room
the whole time.

1795
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:17,619
There's so many people
in this house--

1796
01:30:19,539 --> 01:30:21,457
Okay, because that's
right when I went down

1797
01:30:21,624 --> 01:30:22,958
to make the shepherd pie,

1798
01:30:23,126 --> 01:30:25,794
the dinner that I'm making
for you and the family,

1799
01:30:25,962 --> 01:30:28,255
and you're being rude
to everyone.

1800
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:41,310
Do you ever feel
like sometimes

1801
01:30:41,478 --> 01:30:43,771
you just want to spend
the whole day in bed?

1802
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:46,899
And then when you work
and everything, you can't?

1803
01:30:47,066 --> 01:30:51,111
I think that's probably
how he's feeling right now.

1804
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:54,615
You know, he just kind of
wants to escape.

1805
01:30:54,783 --> 01:30:56,784
And I don't know
what happened yesterday.

1806
01:30:58,661 --> 01:31:00,496
Victoria, it's not about
sticking up to him.

1807
01:31:00,663 --> 01:31:02,873
When people are mad
like Daddy just was--

1808
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:06,126
- You know when you're frustrated...
- Oh, my gosh.

1809
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:09,797
...it's the people that are closest
to you that you take it out on.

1810
01:31:09,964 --> 01:31:11,465
I tell my mom that a lot,

1811
01:31:11,633 --> 01:31:13,175
that she needs
to stick up to him.

1812
01:31:13,343 --> 01:31:16,053
She thinks that that would
just cause a bigger problem,

1813
01:31:16,221 --> 01:31:19,932
but I think that could,
like, resolve the problem,

1814
01:31:20,099 --> 01:31:23,435
'cause I think sometimes
my dad just needs

1815
01:31:23,603 --> 01:31:27,523
to be told that--
I don't know--

1816
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:31,485
he's not the only one
who matters in the house.

1817
01:31:33,863 --> 01:31:36,281
How you feel
when he's mad?

1818
01:31:36,449 --> 01:31:38,992
How do you deal with that
when he's mad?

1819
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:41,662
How do you deal?
How do you cope up?

1820
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:43,622
I know it's nothing
that I did.

1821
01:31:43,790 --> 01:31:45,916
So, I mean,
I can deal with it.

1822
01:31:46,084 --> 01:31:47,960
- I mean, if I'm at fault--
- He's not mad at you.

1823
01:31:48,127 --> 01:31:50,295
He's just like-- he's like,

1824
01:31:50,463 --> 01:31:51,755
"Why is this--" you know?

1825
01:31:51,923 --> 01:31:52,965
He just wants to say something.

1826
01:31:53,132 --> 01:31:54,132
It wasn't even me,
so I know--

1827
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:55,843
I wasn't the one
that left the door open.

1828
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:57,761
I wasn't the one that
left the light on.

1829
01:31:57,929 --> 01:31:59,346
- Oh.
- You know?

1830
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:00,889
I think my dad married my mom

1831
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:03,433
as a trophy wife maybe

1832
01:32:03,601 --> 01:32:06,520
to, like, show her off,
'cause she's really pretty.

1833
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:08,981
He doesn't act like
he loves her

1834
01:32:09,148 --> 01:32:11,817
the way he treats her
and stuff.

1835
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:14,736
No, just tell him
how much you love him.

1836
01:32:14,904 --> 01:32:17,197
He needs to know that.

1837
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:19,241
He's-- he had a bad day.

1838
01:32:19,409 --> 01:32:21,201
Hi, Dad.

1839
01:32:24,414 --> 01:32:26,915
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

1840
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:30,043
I love you,
Daddy.

1841
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:32,045
He just wants
to say he loves you.

1842
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:34,965
- He loves you.
- Thank you.

1843
01:32:35,133 --> 01:32:38,719
If you love me, you'll turn off
the lights when you see them on.

1844
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:47,728
Well, we tried, honey.

1845
01:32:47,896 --> 01:32:50,188
Senator DeMint,
thank you so much forjoining us

1846
01:32:50,356 --> 01:32:52,524
from South Carolina.

1847
01:32:52,692 --> 01:32:54,151
And we'll certainly
be watching

1848
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:56,695
his candidate forum
tomorrow.

1849
01:32:56,863 --> 01:32:58,697
Michael Gerson,

1850
01:32:58,865 --> 01:33:02,659
former speechwriter for
President George W. Bush...

1851
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:14,713
- Are we getting near the end?
- Yes, we are.

1852
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:19,134
We need to live
within our means.

1853
01:33:19,302 --> 01:33:21,762
Don't spend money
that we don't have.

1854
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:24,598
Don't spend money
that we think

1855
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:27,225
we're going
to eventually have.

1856
01:33:27,393 --> 01:33:29,853
Spend what we do have.

1857
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:32,314
You know, get back
to reality.

1858
01:33:32,482 --> 01:33:34,983
I never expected
to live here.

1859
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:37,736
I never expected Versailles.

1860
01:33:37,904 --> 01:33:41,823
I never expected a private jet.

1861
01:33:41,991 --> 01:33:43,241
I hope we can stay here.

1862
01:33:43,409 --> 01:33:45,702
I'm looking around now, it's like,

1863
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:49,665
I'd better start taking pictures, huh?

1864
01:33:49,832 --> 01:33:52,584
For my memories and-- no, I don't
think we're going to lose our house.

1865
01:33:52,752 --> 01:33:55,337
But who knows?

1866
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:58,966
Like, you probably know
more than I do.

1867
01:33:59,133 --> 01:34:00,801
Right? You spent, like,
an hour and a half,

1868
01:34:00,969 --> 01:34:03,428
two hours with my husband
this morning.

1869
01:34:03,596 --> 01:34:06,056
Like, we don't talk about
financial problems.

1870
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:08,058
I guess I'll have to watch
the movie, right,

1871
01:34:08,226 --> 01:34:12,729
to find out what's going on
in my life.

1872
01:34:12,897 --> 01:34:14,940
Well, if I could
turn the clock back,

1873
01:34:15,108 --> 01:34:17,526
there would be a lot of things I would
have done differently.

1874
01:34:17,694 --> 01:34:20,112
Instead of having 28 resorts,

1875
01:34:20,279 --> 01:34:22,656
I would have had 15 resorts.

1876
01:34:22,824 --> 01:34:25,784
I kind of wish he never
took the mortgage out.

1877
01:34:25,952 --> 01:34:28,787
I mean, we owned all the land
and we just built the house.

1878
01:34:28,955 --> 01:34:33,500
I guess he was going to use
that money for Las Vegas.

1879
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:35,961
It's a vicious cycle.

1880
01:34:36,129 --> 01:34:38,922
No one is without guilt,

1881
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:40,424
and I'm the same way.

1882
01:34:40,591 --> 01:34:43,802
You know, they were
giving me cheap money

1883
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:48,265
and I was using it to build
big buildings and buy more resorts.

1884
01:34:48,433 --> 01:34:50,726
And then when they stopped
giving me the money,

1885
01:34:50,893 --> 01:34:55,105
I'm suddenly, "Whoa,
how do I pay for all this?"

1886
01:34:56,816 --> 01:34:58,483
Okay, this could
go on forever.

1887
01:34:58,651 --> 01:35:00,569
Can we wind it up, please?

1888
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:08,744
I didn't know the house
was in foreclosure.

1889
01:35:08,911 --> 01:35:10,454
I didn't know this whole process
was going on.

1890
01:35:10,621 --> 01:35:13,749
I didn't know we stopped
paying the mortgage.

1891
01:35:13,916 --> 01:35:18,503
This is all news to me.
I-- I didn't know.

1892
01:35:22,258 --> 01:35:25,594
I kind of wish
that I was more involved

1893
01:35:25,762 --> 01:35:27,179
because I'm not a stupid person.

1894
01:35:27,346 --> 01:35:30,891
But when you don't have
the information,

1895
01:35:31,059 --> 01:35:33,143
it makes you look stupid.

1896
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:35,645
And without the information,

1897
01:35:35,813 --> 01:35:37,689
I mean, what can I do,
you know?

1898
01:35:41,027 --> 01:35:44,738
I guess I'm in this fantasy world,
you know?

1899
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:49,993
Until reality hits.

1900
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:52,662
But I have faith.

1901
01:35:58,044 --> 01:35:59,920
I'm here through
thick and thin

1902
01:36:00,088 --> 01:36:02,297
till the day we die.

1903
01:36:02,465 --> 01:36:05,550
And that's the only way
that I would ever leave him,

1904
01:36:05,718 --> 01:36:07,761
is if I died, you know.

1905
01:36:07,929 --> 01:36:10,931
If we had to buy just
a normal house,

1906
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:13,475
like $300,000 house,

1907
01:36:13,643 --> 01:36:17,187
four-bedroom house or--

1908
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:19,064
I would--

1909
01:36:19,232 --> 01:36:21,108
I would be fine with that
and make it work.

1910
01:36:21,275 --> 01:36:23,443
Just get a bunch
of bunk beds, you know?

1911
01:36:27,698 --> 01:36:29,407
I do enjoy this view here.

1912
01:36:29,575 --> 01:36:31,076
I mean, this is so peaceful.

1913
01:36:31,244 --> 01:36:34,496
I almost think I would love

1914
01:36:34,664 --> 01:36:36,331
just to spend
the rest of my life here.

1915
01:36:36,499 --> 01:36:39,668
I think this is wonderful,

1916
01:36:39,836 --> 01:36:42,087
having my private island.

1917
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,081

1918
01:36:47,305 --> 01:37:47,293

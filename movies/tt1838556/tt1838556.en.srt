{\an8}<i>$658,000 was stolen from
the Seneca Savings and Loan</i>

4

{\an8}<i>over this past
Fourth of July weekend.</i>

5
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:02,041
<i>Local police
have found no clues</i>

6
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:05,916
<i>as to how the bank robber
was able to enter or exit the bank.</i>

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,834
<i>Another small town
bank robbery over the weekend.</i>

8
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:11,083
<i>No suspects have been identified.</i>

9
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:13,667
<i>Now, a third robbery,</i>

10
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,166
<i>this time in Williamsport,
Pennsylvania,</i>

11
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,500
<i>by what appears to be
the same modus operandi.</i>

12
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,166
<i>The In-and-Out
Bandit has done it once again.</i>

13
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,875
{\an8}<i>The eighth robbery in the past six years</i>

14
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:28,542
{\an8}<i>and authorities still have no suspects.</i>

15
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,125
Hello?

16
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,333
Hello?

17
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:45,667
Oh, good.

18
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,083
I was wondering when somebody
was gonnasss show up and help me.

19
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,833
- Oh, I... I don't...
- I need a storage unit

20
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:54,041
for all the crap that I have,
that I don't really want or need,

21
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,625
but that I'm too chicken
to get rid of.

22
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,542
Actually, considering all my baggage,

23
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,000
I might need two units,
depending on how,

24
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,833
you know, big and smelly they are.

25
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,459
You prefer smelly?

26
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:05,791
I do. Who doesn't, really?

27
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,417
Ooh. That looks good.

28
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,417
Oh. Please, allow me.

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,916
Mmm. Thank you.

30
00:03:14,584 --> 00:03:17,500
- You work here, right?
- I do.

31
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:19,791
I do. Although, you know,

32
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,916
I prefer to call it "paid study hall."

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,584
Oh. You're in college, huh?

34
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,041
Don't I look like
I'm in college?

35
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:29,041
BC, grad school.

36
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,333
- Three semesters to go.
- Good for you.

37
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:34,041
Ah. So, let me guess.

38
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:35,709
You need a storage unit.

39
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,417
Yes, please.

40
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:39,624
Preferably one that doesn't smell.

41
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:43,250
Okay. Let's see what I can do.
But, um,

42
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,375
we should probably switch places.

43
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,875
- Oh, yeah. Sorry. Right.
- Mmm-hmm.

44
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,417
So, uh...

45
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:00,000
Fill in the blank
with your name here.

46
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,875
- Tom.
- Tom.

47
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,000
Tom.

48
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,417
We have small, medium, and large.

49
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,958
Well, I just moved into town,
I don't have much,

50
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,125
so I guess
medium should work.

51
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,667
Fill in the blank with your name.

52
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,833
- Annie.
- Annie.

53
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:23,667
All right.
Medium and not smelly it is.

54
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,208
Come on, come on.

55
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:01,459
How did you get in?

56
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:03,000
The back door was open.

57
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Just 'cause there's a "for sale" sign
doesn't mean that this isn't,

58
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:10,208
I don't know, breaking and entering.

59
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:12,042
- Trespassing?
- Oh, yeah.

60
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:13,916
Maybe.

61
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,584
I mean, come on, you know,
I'm all for a little mischief,

62
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,625
but what are we...
What are we doing here?

63
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,250
What do you think?

64
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:27,208
Oh. Uh...

65
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,083
What do I think... I think it's...

66
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:32,708
I think it's cute.

67
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,334
You know, reminds me
of the Cape I grew up in.

68
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:37,791
Yeah, I know.

69
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:42,125
I mean, it could use
some paint. Maybe yellow.

70
00:05:42,584 --> 00:05:44,000
Yellow, huh?

71
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,459
And, uh, Newton's a great neighborhood.

72
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:50,083
Lots of nice restaurants and parks.

73
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:53,542
And I hear amazing police department,
so let's get out of here.

74
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,083
Uh... So I heard.

75
00:05:56,958 --> 00:06:00,916
Maybe they'll go easy on us
if we make a decent offer.

76
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,500
Wait. I'm sorry, what?

77
00:06:04,584 --> 00:06:07,791
That is if you're interested
in moving in with me.

78
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:10,666
Are you...

79
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,375
Okay, are you messing with me right now?

80
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:14,000
Not in the slightest.

81
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,917
It's been a year, honey.
One year.

82
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,334
It has.

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,208
Aw, it's been a wonderful,
wonderful year.

84
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:27,583
I just don't...

85
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,750
I don't know, I just...

86
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:34,833
I haven't

87
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,167
lived with anyone
since the divorce, and, uh...

88
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:45,833
I just can't go through that again.

89
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:47,125
You won't have to.

90
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,375
I promise.

91
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,208
Oh, God, it is a beautiful home.

92
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:02,125
So, is that a, uh...

93
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:04,625
Yes?

94
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:08,083
Can you... Can we even afford this?

95
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:11,625
Well, I have to work out
a couple of things, but

96
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,167
yes, we can.

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,167
Okay.

98
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,375
Yeah!

99
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,917
- Annie?
- Mmm?

100
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,791
There is something else
I need to tell you.

101
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,500
No. Not tonight.

102
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,625
This girl has had
enough surprises for one night.

103
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:43,791
It can wait.

104
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,167
Here.

105
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,541
Suppose I ought to get you
some real dog food, huh?

106
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:29,750
What kind do you like?

107
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,209
- Ain't that Theresa's dog?
- Used to be.

108
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,209
- What does that mean?
- The divorce, it went through.

109
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,792
It's official.

110
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,292
She got the house and I got Tazzie.

111
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,917
Did you even want Tazzie?

112
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,125
But her freakin' lawyer
was asking for everything.

113
00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:58,292
The house, the two cars,
the few stocks we own.

114
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,875
So I started asking
for everything.

115
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,083
The judge was rational,
cut everything down in the middle,

116
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,666
except for the house and the dog.

117
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,250
And she preferred the house.

118
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:59,416
<i>Federal Bureau of Investigation.
How may I direct your call?</i>

119
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,792
I'm the In-and-Out Bandit.

120
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,708
I wanna turn myself in.

121
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,708

I wanna turn myself in.

124
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,541
<i>Give me a second.</i>

125
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,333
We got another In-and-Out confession.

126
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,750
That's a popular one.
Must be trending.

127
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,416
Whatever that means.

128
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:41,500
Okay. Why don't we start with a name?

129
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:42,958
You can call me Tom.

130
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,792
Tom Carter.

131
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,209
Okay.

132
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,583
Tom Carter,

133
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:51,250
why don't you tell me
what you've been up to?

134
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,875
<i>I'm in the news.
You know what I've been up to.</i>

135
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:54,958
Humor me.

136
00:10:57,292 --> 00:10:59,583
I've robbed 12 banks
in seven states.

137
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,333
I've a little over
nine million dollars in cash.

138
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,416
And no one knows who I am.

139
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,125
How long'd that take?

140
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,458
Um, about eight years.

141
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,625
<i>But I haven't robbed anything
in over a year.</i>

142
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,333
<i>Okay. You got an address
where I can find you?</i>

143
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,416
I wanna make a deal.

144
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,333
A deal?

145
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:23,833
What kinda deal?

146
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,084
I hand over all the money
I stole, every penny,

147
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,917
in exchange for a reduced sentence,

148
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,833
no more than two years
in minimum security

149
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:34,416
within an hour of Boston.

150
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,084
<i>With full visitation rights.</i>

151
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:38,167
You've thought this through.

152
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,750
It's important.

153
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,209
And what's so important about it?

154
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:42,959
I...

155
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,875
I met a woman.

156
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,541
She's smart, caring, driven, funny.

157
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:55,708
I adore every bit of her.

158
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,167
I want to be with her
for the rest of my days

159
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,250
without feeling guilty
about lying to her about my past

160
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,750
indiscretions.

161
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:08,708
Well, she sounds
like an incredible woman.

162
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:09,792
<i>She is.</i>

163
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,875
And she means more to me
than all the dollar bills in the world.

164
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,875
So, do we have a deal?

165
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,583
That's not how it works, buddy.

166
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:24,375
But I'll be happy to listen to you
and put in a good word for you

167
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,875
if you are in fact
the In-and-Out Bandit.

168
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,833
- What do you mean, "if"?
- <i>Listen.</i>

169
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:30,708
Ten, fifteen guys

170
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,708
have confessed to being
the In-and-Out Bandit.

171
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:34,250
You think I'm making this up?

172
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,125
Well, you wouldn't be the first.

173
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:39,208
I'm telling the truth.
I'm the In-and-Out Bandit.

174
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,250
Even though I hate that name
you people gave me.

175
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,833
It wasn't me.

176
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,500
All right.

177
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,000
Where can I find you?

178
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,375
The Charleston Hotel.

179
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,167
Room 216.

180
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,167
That's a nice place.
I'll swing by there tomorrow.

181
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,375
I'll be here.

182
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,792
He met a woman.

183
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,792
Poor guy.

184
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,208
Got another In-and-Out confession.

185
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:18,208
All the details are in here.
Would you boys look into it?

186
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,458
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah, will do, sir.

187
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,792
{\an8}- Hi, sweet Annie.
- <i>I aced it.</i>

188
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,250
{\an8}- Aced what?
- <i>My exam!</i>

189
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,875
Oh! Right.

190
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,792
Oh, fantastic! I knew you would.

191
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,458
- What's wrong?
- <i>What do you mean?</i>

192
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:44,708
I can hear it in your voice.
Something's going on.

193
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:47,458
- You sound like a therapist.
- <i>I almost am one.</i>

194
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:50,750
- Although not yours.
- I know.

195
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:53,166
<i>So, what's going on
in that brain of yours?</i>

196
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,875
Uh... I'm just a little preoccupied,
that's all.

197
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,625
What, with work? It's a little late
to be fixing safes, isn't it?

198
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,875
<i>No, the apartment above mine,</i>

199
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:10,125
one of his pipes burst in his bathroom
and flooded my place.

200
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,583
Had to get a hotel room.

201
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:14,084
<i>It's okay, they're paying for it.</i>

202
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,834
Yeah? So, where are
they putting you up?

203
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:19,333
The Charleston Hotel.
It's not so bad.

204
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:21,750
<i>Mmm. Maybe I should come on over.</i>

205
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:24,125
<i>I got a five-dollar bottle of wine.</i>

206
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,166
- We could celebrate.
- <i>Tempting.</i>

207
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm just a bit wiped out, baby.

208
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:31,125
You sure you're okay?

209
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,959
- Annie?
- Yes, my love.

210
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,042
I'm proud of you.

211
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,000
Mmm. Thank you.

212
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:14,875
- Oh. Hello.
- Hello.

213
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:15,959
Room clean?

214
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:18,208
Uh... No, thank you.
Not today.

215
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,125
- Please.
- <i>Gracias.</i>

216
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,041
<i>You can't do that! Tazzie needs me.</i>

217
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,709
<i>You don't even know
how to take care of Tazzie!</i>

218
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:35,959
- There...
- <i>You're crazy!</i>

219
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,500
Theresa. Theresa.

220
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,542
She's doing just fine.

221
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,834
No. No!
No, no, you heard the judge.

222
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:44,291
You made your choice.
Well, that was the deal.

223
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,458
She's my dog. You can't have her back.

224
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:47,792
Goodbye.

225
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,792
- Special Agent Meyers. How...
- <i>I asked for Agent Baker.</i>

226
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,000
- Uh, he's out.
- When will he be back?

227
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,750
<i>He didn't say.
You wanna leave a message?</i>

228
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,375
This is Tom Carter.
I talked to him the other day.

229
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:02,333
Oh, right.
The In-and-Out Bandit.

230
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:05,041
<i>I really wish you guys
would stop calling me that.</i>

231
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,166
I could put in a special request.
What name would you prefer?

232
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:13,458
I don't know. In-and-Out
just sounds so low rent, unprofessional.

233
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,083
My work has always
been precise, clean.

234
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:19,083
I think "clean" is taken.
You wanna go with "precise"?

235
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:22,458
- <i>How about Precise Bandit?</i>
- Funny.

236
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,208
Look, something came up...

237
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:27,125
I've been waiting
for two days! Two days!

238
00:16:27,207 --> 00:16:29,000
- <i>When will he be...</i>
- Well, let me finish, guy.

239
00:16:31,165 --> 00:16:32,542
Something came up,

240
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,166
but he assigned a couple
of very good agents to your case.

241
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,250
When will they be...

242
00:16:36,332 --> 00:16:37,875
I'm sure they'll be there
very shortly.

243
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:39,375
You have
a good day, Mr. Carter.

244
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,834
Enough of this.

245
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,667
Special Agent Hall.
This is Special Agent Nivens.

246
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,667
You the Bandit?

247
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,083
I'm Tom Carter, yes.

248
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:03,250
I don't get it.
I'm trying to come clean here,

249
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,375
drop nine million dollars
in your laps.

250
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,125
Make you guys look like heroes,
and you don't believe me.

251
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,208
It's nothing
to get worked up, okay?

252
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:13,292
We believe that you believe

253
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,000
you have nine million dollars
in stolen money.

254
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,208
How about we try this?

255
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:18,958
You give us something
that we haven't read online

256
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,917
or seen on a YouTube clip.

257
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,375
Specific details about these robberies
that only you would know.

258
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:29,834
Okay.

259
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,667
All right.

260
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,333
<i>Twelve banks.</i>

261
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,500
<i>The key was picking
the right bank at the right time.</i>

262
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:43,375
<i>I focused on small town banks
with older vaults, pre-1950.</i>

263
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,625
<i>The relocking mechanisms
on the newer models</i>

264
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:47,000
<i>are more difficult to blow.</i>

265
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:50,208
<i>But just as important,</i>

266
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:52,709
<i>I needed the bank to have
a vacant building next to it</i>

267
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,667
<i>with an adjoining wall.</i>

268
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,458
<i>If you check the dates
of the robberies,</i>

269
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:59,625
<i>you'll notice
I always went in on a Friday night</i>

270
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:01,916
<i>over a three-day holiday weekend.</i>

271
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,709
<i>I would enter the bank through
an air conditioning vent.</i>

272
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,083
<i>It took patience and a steady hand</i>

273
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,208
<i>to drill through
composition steel doors,</i>

274
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,166
<i>something I couldn't rush.</i>

275
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:19,000
<i>I preferred using gelignite
stuffed into balloons.</i>

276
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,041
<i>That'll blow almost any bolt.</i>

277
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
<i>I covered my tracks
by patching the wall</i>

278
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,250
<i>with some plaster
and a little paint.</i>

279
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:36,333
<i>When I was finished,
it was like I was never there.</i>

280
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:37,875
Interesting.

281
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,792
So let's say we do believe you...

282
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,709
Where's the money?

283
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:45,166
First things first.

284
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,542
I want some guarantees.

285
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,709
- Of course, the, uh, deal proposal.
- Yeah.

286
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:52,584
- Minimum security...
- Near Boston,

287
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:53,958
with visitation rights.

288
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,958
Okay. Well, uh,
we should probably go.

289
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,000
- Yeah.
- What? Where are you going?

290
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,625
Your story's good, all right?
And we'll try to verify the facts.

291
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:05,792
But I'm sorry,
no one's cutting a deal without proof.

292
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,542
- The money.
- Exactly.

293
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,667
Aurora self storage.
A few miles west of here.

294
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,208
Unit 173.

295
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:19,417
- Let's go.
- Thanks.

296
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,208
Thanks, Mr. Carter, but I'll take those.

297
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:23,916
- We'll check it out.
- Shouldn't I come with you?

298
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,417
- No. Not necessary.
- We'll be back.

299
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,375
Stay put.

300
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,958
You think this lady is real,
or is she a delusion?

301
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,625
What, like this money?

302
00:19:44,709 --> 00:19:46,625
Love is weird, man.

303
00:19:47,584 --> 00:19:49,667
Look, I thought I knew
how much I love my wife

304
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,208
even before we were married,
but it doesn't compare

305
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,375
to how much I love
those two little boys.

306
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,125
It's just something
about being a father.

307
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,916
Isn't that just a sales pitch, though?

308
00:19:58,459 --> 00:20:00,584
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

309
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,916
I just feel like every new father
can't stop talking

310
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,958
about how great it is
to be a new father, you know?

311
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,417
Wish they did it sooner.
Best thing they ever did.

312
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,875
I don't buy it, man. I think they're
just trying to convince their friends

313
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,500
to push out a couple of kids,
so they got someone to commiserate with

314
00:20:14,584 --> 00:20:16,333
while they're watching kiddie soccer.

315
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:18,916
You ever thought
about snipping your balls off?

316
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,417
I think
it could be a good idea.

317
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,250
Yeah, no one's clipping my junk.

318
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,250
Speaking of which, are we done here?

319
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,500
John.

320
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,709
I think this girl is real.

321
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,500
And amazing.

322
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:45,750
Looks legit.

323
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,542
Son of a bitch was telling the truth.

324
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:54,500
Get the trunk.

325
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,708
Open the trunk.

326
00:21:00,584 --> 00:21:02,750
What are we doing here?

327
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,875
Confiscating stolen property.

328
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,167
For evidence.

329
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,292
No, for our personal retirement funds.

330
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,667
Are you outta your mind?
We can't take this!

331
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,584
Oh, don't act like we're popping
your cherry, okay? Please.

332
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:19,042
- This is different.
- How is it different?

333
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,791
How is it different?

334
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,584
Look, whether you're pinching

335
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:24,625
a couple of bills
off some guy washing cash

336
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,250
or squeezing a gaming racket for 20K,

337
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,000
the concept's the same.
How is this different?

338
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,916
I can think of nine million reasons
why this is different.

339
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,666
You're right, okay?
So we turn it in, yeah?

340
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,791
It sits in evidence
for two years while they try this asshole.

341
00:21:39,292 --> 00:21:40,542
Who gets rich?

342
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:42,208
Lawyers.

343
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:46,125
Meanwhile, you and I
are out here every day,

344
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:49,334
busting our butts,
risking our lives, for what?

345
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:51,584
To get by?
You like getting by?

346
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,292
That's the job I signed up to do.

347
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,791
Oh, that is noble and naive.

348
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:59,500
Don't let the car
and the badge and the gun fool you.

349
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,042
It doesn't belong to you.
It belongs to the Man.

350
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,375
He owns you and he owns me.

351
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:06,292
Until he cuts us loose,
what are we actually left with, huh?

352
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,042
I see your point,
but we're never gonna get away with this.

353
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,500
Carter's gonna scream bloody murder.

354
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:17,833
So let him. What's one nutjob's word
against ours, huh?

355
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,208
No one's gonna believe
that "all for love" story.

356
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:23,000
All right? Where's the evidence?

357
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,083
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

358
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:27,750
It's nothing but perfect.

359
00:22:28,334 --> 00:22:29,708
We could go to prison.

360
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,208
Look,

361
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:34,750
the universe just dropped
a gift bag of money on your doorstep.

362
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:37,791
Money that doesn't belong
to anybody.

363
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:41,875
Enough to never have to worry about
another mortgage payment,

364
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:45,417
or where you can
or can't send those boys to school.

365
00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:48,459
All you gotta do is pick up a box,

366
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,125
and be a hero to your family.

367
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,917
Hey, it's your call.

368
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:09,958
Let's do it.

369
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,125
Excuse me.

370
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,042
- Hi.
- Hi.

371
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:25,125
I'm the manager here.

372
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:27,833
I saw you guys on the security camera.
I didn't recognize you.

373
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:30,208
I'm Pete. This is Mario.

374
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:31,292
- How are you?
- Hey there.

375
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,459
We're friends of Tom's.
He, uh... He rents this unit.

376
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:35,292
- Yeah, yeah, I know Tom.
- Oh.

377
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,666
Is he coming?

378
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,833
No, but... He gave us the key.

379
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,875
Yeah, he's busy. Moving.

380
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:43,167
- Moving?
- Mmm.

381
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,334
Oh, because of the water leak.

382
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,209
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

383
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:50,791
He, uh, called in a favor,
so here we are.

384
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,666
So, you guys work together, or...

385
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,417
No, no, no.
We're friends from way back.

386
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:59,666
Wait a minute,
did you serve together in the Marines?

387
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,334
- <i>Semper Fi.</i>
- Hoorah.

388
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:04,209
All right... Marines.

389
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:07,708
Um, well, let me know
if you need anything, okay?

390
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,541
- Yeah, will do. Thanks.
- Okay.

391
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:14,625
Hey, um, did he happen to mention
where's he's moving?

392
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:17,167
Was it the Newton house?

393
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,541
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

394
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,250
I think that's the one.

395
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:23,083
Yeah?

396
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,625
All right.
Be sure to lock up.

397
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,209
Take care.

398
00:25:10,917 --> 00:25:13,792
- This a company safe house?
- Ah, used to be.

399
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:17,209
Nobody's stepping foot
in this neighborhood anymore.

400
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:19,417
Come on.

401
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:22,875
You gotta go pee-pee, huh?

402
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:24,750
You gotta go
pee-pee poo-poo?

403
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:27,292
You gotta go pee-pee?
All right, come on.

404
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:30,000
Someday
you're gonna have to learn how to walk.

405
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,000
Looks like someone's
growing on you.

406
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:34,625
Less needy than the ex.

407
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,583
Oh, uh, your buddy
Tom Carter called again.

408
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:37,833
What now?

409
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:40,458
He's complaining about his nickname
and nobody wants to arrest him.

410
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:43,125
Didn't Hall and Nivens
follow up on him?

411
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:47,750
They must be from
the "orders are optional" generation.

412
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:13,250
I'll meet you outside.
I gotta hit the head.

413
00:26:13,334 --> 00:26:14,583
All right, cool.

414
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:57,958
What took so long?

415
00:26:58,541 --> 00:27:00,042
Did you find it?

416
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:02,875
We did. Right where you said
it would be.

417
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:05,375
Let's have a chat.

418
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:12,875
So, do we have a deal?

419
00:27:13,541 --> 00:27:15,708
I, uh, hear you're a Marine.

420
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:21,625
- How many times you ship out?
- Quite a few, actually.

421
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,042
Guess that makes you
kind of dangerous, huh?

422
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:28,667
What's with the gloves?

423
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:35,541
- Whoa, whoa, hey.
- Pick it up.

424
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:36,708
I'm turning myself in.

425
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:44,500
I said pick it up.

426
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:48,000
This isn't what we talked about.

427
00:27:53,084 --> 00:27:54,209
Did you count it?

428
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,084
The cash.

429
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:57,833
Did you count it?

430
00:27:58,708 --> 00:28:00,416
What would've happened
if I'd counted it?

431
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,209
When you got to three million,
you would've run out of money.

432
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:04,500
Bullshit.

433
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:06,667
Figured I might need
a bargaining chip.

434
00:28:08,084 --> 00:28:09,416
Seems I was right.

435
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,833
Three's a lot of money.

436
00:28:11,917 --> 00:28:14,084
Yeah, but nine sounds better,
doesn't it?

437
00:28:18,917 --> 00:28:22,375
Okay. Suppose you're right.
Where's the other six?

438
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:26,541
You expecting company?

439
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:32,667
Special Agent Sam Baker, FBI.
Open up, Carter.

440
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:39,625
What do I do?

441
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:43,625
Open the door.

442
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:45,750
Just a second.

443
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,375
Ah.

444
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:53,291
You got five minutes, and
the clock's already ticking.

445
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:57,000
Open up.

446
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:01,000
Open the door, Carter.

447
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:05,167
All right, go.

448
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:20,750
Oh.

449
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:23,959
- You guys handling this?
- Sir.

450
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:26,042
Let me by.

451
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,291
What's with the 9mm?

452
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:53,208
What exactly...

453
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:15,250
Go! Go, get outta here!

454
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:21,917
Go! Move! Come on!

455
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:30,583
Shoot him!

456
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,625
Get down!

457
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:41,667
Get in!

458
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,750
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see you.

459
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:49,375
Who's shooting at us?

460
00:30:50,917 --> 00:30:53,000
- FBI.
- FBI?

461
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,542
I can't believe you shot Baker.

462
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:02,291
Hey, you need to cut that out, all right?
Wake up!

463
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:05,042
I didn't shoot Baker, Carter did.

464
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,000
What the hell are you doing with that?
That's evidence!

465
00:31:08,084 --> 00:31:10,333
Carter took my Sig.

466
00:31:11,792 --> 00:31:13,667
- You have a gun?
- It's not mine.

467
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,959
What did you do, Tom?

468
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:20,500
- Tell me what you did.
- I will, Annie, I promise.

469
00:31:21,542 --> 00:31:23,625
But first,
we have to ditch this car.

470
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:26,542
- This is your Jeep.
- Not anymore.

471
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:36,208
There he is.

472
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,750
Look out!

473
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:47,458
- Anything?
- They can't be far.

474
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,375
I can explain.

475
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:55,083
The In-and-Out Bandit?

476
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:57,208
I haven't robbed a bank
in over a year.

477
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:00,792
In fact, I haven't so much
as jaywalked since I met you.

478
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:03,458
- Well, you just hot-wired a car.
- Okay, until tonight.

479
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:05,750
This is insane.

480
00:35:08,292 --> 00:35:10,166
Listen to me.
You have to turn yourself in.

481
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,500
That's what I was trying to do.

482
00:35:12,584 --> 00:35:14,500
That's what I've been wanting
to tell you, but...

483
00:35:15,792 --> 00:35:17,000
I didn't have the courage.

484
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:18,584
Wait, wait, wait.

485
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:19,750
The first surprise was,

486
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:22,458
"Let's get a cute house
in Newton and move in together,"

487
00:35:22,542 --> 00:35:24,375
and the second was
you're a bank robber?

488
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:28,875
I just felt if you and I were gonna
have a chance at a life together,

489
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:31,584
which I want
even more than you know,

490
00:35:32,292 --> 00:35:34,542
I needed to come clean
to the Feds and to you.

491
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:36,667
And you just assumed
that I'd be okay with this?

492
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,458
I was hoping once you knew
the whole story, you'd be understanding.

493
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:41,958
We both know we're good together.

494
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:44,041
That was before
I knew you were a bank robber.

495
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,792
I'm not a bank robber anymore.

496
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:48,292
I need some air.

497
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,333
- Pull the car over, Tom!
- Okay, okay, okay.

498
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:25,125
How many people have you killed?

499
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,916
No one.
Not even in the Marines.

500
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,916
You made bombs. Bombs kill people.

501
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,208
I didn't make bombs.
I disarmed land mines.

502
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:37,625
You've been lying to me
this whole time.

503
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,542
I didn't lie, Annie.

504
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:44,041
I just didn't tell you certain things.

505
00:36:45,542 --> 00:36:48,625
I considered just keeping my mouth shut,
keeping the money,

506
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:51,333
but I knew that secret would

507
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:56,208
eat me up inside
and hurt what you and I have.

508
00:36:56,292 --> 00:36:57,916
So, the house, were you gonna...

509
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,750
You gonna pay for that
with stolen money?

510
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:03,167
No. I had money
saved up from when I was in the service.

511
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,167
And the safe business...

512
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:07,167
That wasn't a real job?

513
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:15,916
So, what else have you been
lying to me about?

514
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,250
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

515
00:37:19,542 --> 00:37:20,709
Well,

516
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:26,167
except, there was no water leak
in my apartment, and, uh...

517
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:31,542
I don't like the health cookies you make,
even though I say I do.

518
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,584
And I agree the house needs paint,

519
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:35,958
but I hate yellow.

520
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:40,833
Paint.

521
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,916
Cookies? Water leaks?

522
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,958
Okay, this is not the honesty
that I'm looking for, okay?

523
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:49,916
Right now, I'm trying to determine
if you're a pathological liar,

524
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,708
or a complete sociopath!

525
00:37:52,791 --> 00:37:54,542
I'm none of the above.

526
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:12,167
Why?

527
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,125
Why did you rob banks?

528
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:20,167
My mother died of pneumonia
while I was in a dust bowl

529
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,167
fighting somebody else's war.

530
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:27,791
When I got back, my dad
was half the man he was when I left.

531
00:38:28,334 --> 00:38:30,584
He was depressed, lonely.

532
00:38:32,292 --> 00:38:33,542
He missed her.

533
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:39,459
He was a welder for a pipe manufacturer
for over 35 years.

534
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,584
Dedicated company man.

535
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:45,375
But he started having a hard time

536
00:38:45,459 --> 00:38:48,625
finding a reason to get up
in the morning and go to work.

537
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:53,916
His productivity slipped,
and they fired him.

538
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,500
But the worst of it was,
the CEO embezzled millions

539
00:38:58,584 --> 00:39:01,042
from the employee pension fund,

540
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,042
denying my father his pension.

541
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:09,542
He didn't have it in him
to deal with lawyers and fight it.

542
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,875
Instead, he drove
his Chevy Silverado...

543
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:19,459
60 miles an hour
into an oak tree.

544
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,125
No skid marks.

545
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:27,250
A month later,
I walked into the same bank

546
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:29,292
where the CEO kept his money...

547
00:39:32,042 --> 00:39:35,791
And I robbed it.
$658,000.

548
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:39,208
More than my old man
made in his lifetime.

549
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:44,583
I never spent one dime of it.

550
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,208
Then why did you keep doing it?

551
00:39:48,042 --> 00:39:50,500
It wasn't about the money.
It just...

552
00:39:51,542 --> 00:39:54,208
Just felt good.

553
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:59,083
Like when I was sweeping for mines,
not knowing if my next step was my last.

554
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:03,875
Made me feel alive.

555
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:07,958
And then I met you.

556
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,917
Somehow, you gave me
that same feeling

557
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,500
of being alive, so I stopped.

558
00:40:16,417 --> 00:40:17,791
You stopped for me?

559
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:20,750
Yes.

560
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,958
The more time I spent with you,
the more I realized

561
00:40:25,583 --> 00:40:29,917
what I needed in my life
wasn't money or an adrenaline rush,

562
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,500
it was the need to feel love.

563
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:37,875
And I feel that with you.

564
00:40:41,334 --> 00:40:42,708
So there it is.

565
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:49,666
We should go, huh?

566
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:07,250
Out. Out.

567
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,958
I'm sorry, my friend.

568
00:41:19,292 --> 00:41:21,042
This is not how it was supposed to go.

569
00:41:23,625 --> 00:41:26,292
But I promise you,
I will find whoever did this to you.

570
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,917
Where's Nivens and Hall?

571
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,958
The FBI guy you were fighting?

572
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:35,375
Yeah.

573
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:39,250
I saw him and another guy
taking boxes out of your storage unit.

574
00:41:39,334 --> 00:41:40,334
The money.

575
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:42,625
I was giving it back
in exchange for a deal

576
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,917
that wouldn't keep me away
from you for very long.

577
00:41:45,292 --> 00:41:47,958
But then those two
stole the cash and tried to kill me.

578
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:50,792
What's worse, those gunshots you heard,

579
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:54,792
it was them shooting another agent,
which I'm sure they'll pin on me.

580
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:56,458
Your word against theirs.

581
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:59,250
Not a judge in the world
is gonna believe me over them.

582
00:42:00,042 --> 00:42:02,833
And with a murder one charge
for killing one of their own,

583
00:42:02,917 --> 00:42:06,125
the Feds will come after me,
and keep coming until they find me.

584
00:42:06,792 --> 00:42:09,083
If you're with me,
they'll charge you as an accessory.

585
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:11,458
I won't let that happen.

586
00:42:12,209 --> 00:42:13,792
I'm dropping you off
at the next corner.

587
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:16,541
You wait five minutes, call 911,

588
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:18,541
tell them I forced you
into the car as a hostage,

589
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:20,292
but you fought me off and got away.

590
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:24,167
- No, I'm not lying to the police, Tom!
- Okay!

591
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,084
You need to get as far away from the city
as possible.

592
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:29,084
I'm putting you on a bus.

593
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:30,167
A bus?

594
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:34,042
Baker was already down
when we got back.

595
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:36,292
The second we get in the room,
Carter jumps us.

596
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,708
We should've been on it,
for sure, but...

597
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:42,917
He caught us by surprise.

598
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:46,750
- Then what?
- Then he took off in a Jeep.

599
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:49,833
He was with a woman,
but I didn't get a good look at her.

600
00:42:49,917 --> 00:42:51,084
You?

601
00:43:00,167 --> 00:43:02,084
And nothing turned up
at the storage unit?

602
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:03,583
Like a decade's worth of crap.

603
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:05,375
So, if there was no money,

604
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,375
and this guy is just another nutjob,

605
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:11,084
how did a routine interview turn into
me having to go knock on Sam Baker's door

606
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:13,375
and tell his wife
that he's never coming home?

607
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,042
Ask Carter.

608
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:18,292
If they are willing to kill another agent,

609
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:20,958
what are they capable
of doing to you and me?

610
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:25,750
You just can't do this to a person!

611
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:28,917
I know, Annie. I...

612
00:43:30,084 --> 00:43:31,625
I know.

613
00:43:36,292 --> 00:43:37,708
I don't deserve this.

614
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:42,000
When you get
to the city,

615
00:43:42,084 --> 00:43:44,500
find an out-of-the-way place
to stay.

616
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:46,958
Hotel, motel, doesn't matter.

617
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,167
As long as they take cash.

618
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,958
Do not give them your real name.

619
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:54,541
When you're settled,
call me from a pay phone.

620
00:43:56,042 --> 00:43:57,250
Annie.

621
00:43:58,416 --> 00:44:00,250
I lied about what I did,

622
00:44:01,292 --> 00:44:03,000
but not about
how I feel about you,

623
00:44:03,084 --> 00:44:04,792
what I wanted for us.

624
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:08,583
I loved you from the moment
you walked up to that counter.

625
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:10,125
That'll never change.

626
00:44:10,792 --> 00:44:13,250
I'll always love you,
no matter what happens.

627
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,125
If they had accepted your deal
and you went to prison,

628
00:44:32,209 --> 00:44:33,833
I would've waited for you.

629
00:44:38,291 --> 00:44:40,084
I feel like I'm never gonna see you again.

630
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:41,833
You will, I promise.

631
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,084
Come with me.
Come with me, Tom.

632
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:53,792
Come on, we can have
everything we talked about.

633
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:55,416
Maybe in New York.
I don't know, maybe...

634
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,625
I don't know, just come with me.
Get on the bus with me.

635
00:44:57,708 --> 00:45:00,209
Annie, I can't. I have to do this.

636
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,708
Okay.

637
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,500
Okay.

638
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:17,583
Then prove it, Tom.

639
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:21,042
Prove that you didn't kill that man.

640
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:47,667
We, uh...

641
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:51,583
We lifted Carter's fingerprints
from the hotel.

642
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:55,834
His real name is, uh,
Thomas James Dolan.

643
00:46:55,917 --> 00:46:58,166
- Ex-con?
- No, he's clean.

644
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,959
We got a match from his military record.

645
00:47:01,542 --> 00:47:04,792
Former Marine, a lifer.
Demolitions expert,

646
00:47:05,208 --> 00:47:08,375
which would explain
his proficiency in blowing safes.

647
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:10,042
But he retired nine years ago.

648
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:20,959
If this guy were the In-and-Out Bandit,
that would make him a civilian

649
00:47:21,042 --> 00:47:22,875
about a year before
the first bank robbery.

650
00:47:22,959 --> 00:47:24,416
Yeah, well,
my guess is he's been reading

651
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,375
too many In-and-Out Bandit news stories
and PTSD's taken care of the rest.

652
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:29,875
He seem crazy to you?

653
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,375
- Yeah, he did.
- What about the girl?

654
00:47:35,834 --> 00:47:36,875
What about her?

655
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:38,875
A camera picked her up
outside the hotel.

656
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:40,458
We pulled the registration from her car.

657
00:47:40,542 --> 00:47:41,875
Divorced a few years ago.

658
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:44,042
Filed for bankruptcy
after her husband bled

659
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:47,000
their furniture business dry
with a gambling habit.

660
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:51,000
You know, between her ex and,
uh, this wannabe bank robber,

661
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:53,875
seems to me she's not
very good at picking winners.

662
00:47:54,834 --> 00:47:56,083
Who am I to judge?

663
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:59,917
Hard to know what her involvement
in all this might be, but

664
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,291
she must know something,
so let's find her.

665
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:04,750
- What's her name?
- Annie Wilkins.

666
00:48:05,917 --> 00:48:07,125
We're on it.

667
00:48:17,542 --> 00:48:19,417
- Annie.
- <i>Are you okay?</i>

668
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,834
Yeah, I'm fine.

669
00:48:20,917 --> 00:48:24,125
I said to use a pay phone.
You're in New York, yeah?

670
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:26,750
<i>The two FBI guys,
they're on a security camera</i>

671
00:48:26,834 --> 00:48:29,750
<i>unloading boxes out of your storage unit
and putting them into their car.</i>

672
00:48:29,834 --> 00:48:31,417
<i>That's proof that they stole the money.</i>

673
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:34,500
Maybe, but how do you know
they're on camera?

674
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,542
Annie, where are you?

675
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:39,041
{\an8}- Work.
- <i>You got off the bus?</i>

676
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:41,250
There's a back-up memory card
that records over itself

677
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:43,083
every 48 hours.
I had to come get it.

678
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:44,583
Listen to me.

679
00:48:45,166 --> 00:48:48,834
Please hang up
and get out of there right now.

680
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,041
- <i>911, please hold.</i>
- It's an emergency.

681
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:57,709
<i>Please hold.</i>

682
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,208
Annie. There you are.

683
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:12,792
Your boyfriend here?

684
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,959
He's not my boyfriend.

685
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,041
Oh.

686
00:49:17,792 --> 00:49:19,250
Oh, you, uh...

687
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:21,000
Just rob banks together?

688
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:24,166
I don't know what you're talking about.

689
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:31,792
He's got six million dollars
tucked away somewhere.

690
00:49:31,875 --> 00:49:33,458
You got any idea where that might be?

691
00:49:34,709 --> 00:49:35,834
You hiding it for him?

692
00:49:35,917 --> 00:49:39,125
Maybe in, uh, another one
of these units here?

693
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,959
Where's the memory card
for this? Under here?

694
00:49:49,792 --> 00:49:50,959
No!

695
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:56,375
That's not the answer
I was looking for.

696
00:49:58,917 --> 00:49:59,917
Where is it, huh?

697
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,625
- Is it in here?
- No, it's not in there.

698
00:50:04,709 --> 00:50:05,792
No?

699
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:07,625
It's in the drawer on the right.

700
00:50:09,875 --> 00:50:11,000
In here?

701
00:50:16,417 --> 00:50:18,958
You know, lying to me
is not gonna turn out well.

702
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,500
- What the...
- She was a witness.

703
00:50:51,584 --> 00:50:53,208
Was? Is she dead?

704
00:50:53,292 --> 00:50:54,875
No, she's not.
She's about to be.

705
00:50:54,958 --> 00:50:56,916
Stop! You...
You can't just shoot people.

706
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:03,500
- I think she's dead.
- You think?

707
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,250
I don't feel a pulse.

708
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:07,250
We need to get the memory card
for the security cameras.

709
00:51:07,333 --> 00:51:10,417
- It's probably on her.
- Don't touch anything else!

710
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,792
You take care of that.
I got this.

711
00:51:18,834 --> 00:51:19,958
Are you sure
there was a memory card?

712
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:21,875
I don't know! There's gotta be!

713
00:51:24,667 --> 00:51:25,834
It's not here!

714
00:51:31,083 --> 00:51:32,542
We gotta get outta here.

715
00:51:48,584 --> 00:51:51,166
Jesus! God, Annie! Annie!

716
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,667
Come on, Annie. Come on.

717
00:52:00,625 --> 00:52:03,417
Help! Hello!
I need some help here!

718
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,916
- Get a gurney!
- Please!

719
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,667
- What happened?
- I don't know. It's her head.

720
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:08,500
Okay. Get her on an IV, saline.

721
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:09,625
Honey,
you're gonna be fine.

722
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:12,333
Get a CVC, type and cross.
I need an EKG and CT.

723
00:52:12,417 --> 00:52:13,709
- You're gonna be fine.
- Let's move.

724
00:52:13,792 --> 00:52:16,542
Sir, I need some information.
What's the patient's name?

725
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,500
- Sir, what's the patient's name?
- Wilkins.

726
00:52:18,584 --> 00:52:19,958
Wilkins. Annie Wilkins.

727
00:52:20,041 --> 00:52:21,750
Is she allergic
to any medication?

728
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:22,833
Uh...

729
00:52:23,417 --> 00:52:24,625
Not that I know of.

730
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:27,292
What's your relation to her?

731
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:28,833
I'm, uh...

732
00:52:30,041 --> 00:52:32,208
Are you hurt, sir?
Are you... Um...

733
00:52:32,292 --> 00:52:35,000
What? No. This isn't my blood.

734
00:52:35,083 --> 00:52:36,208
- Thank you.
- Sir!

735
00:52:37,709 --> 00:52:38,709
Sir!

736
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:46,167
<i>Federal Bureau of Investigation.
How may I direct your call?</i>

737
00:52:57,916 --> 00:52:59,167
Oh, man.

738
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:03,167
It's Meyers.

739
00:53:05,875 --> 00:53:06,916
Shit.

740
00:53:08,292 --> 00:53:11,459
Nivens, Dolan's on the line
asking for you.

741
00:53:11,542 --> 00:53:13,292
We've already initiated a trace.

742
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:15,167
All right, put that prick on.

743
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:18,625
I tried to turn myself in.

744
00:53:19,208 --> 00:53:21,125
I handed you three million dollars.

745
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:24,000
- What are you talking about?
- My girlfriend! Why?

746
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:26,625
- <i>She had nothing to do with this.</i>
- <i>Girlfriend?</i>

747
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,083
You lost me, buddy.

748
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,083
You there?

749
00:53:36,167 --> 00:53:37,167
Dolan?

750
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:41,500
Agent Nivens, I'm coming for you.

751
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:53,958
You believe this guy?

752
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,750
What I can't believe is you.

753
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:00,333
Oh, is that so?

754
00:54:02,292 --> 00:54:04,083
Well, don't go getting
any brave ideas.

755
00:54:04,958 --> 00:54:06,208
We're in this together.

756
00:54:11,584 --> 00:54:12,584
You got a trace?

757
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:14,000
No. It wasn't long enough.

758
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:17,375
But a black and white spotted him
leaving Grace Hospital in a stolen van...

759
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:19,459
After he dropped off his girlfriend.

760
00:54:20,292 --> 00:54:21,459
What happened to her?

761
00:54:21,542 --> 00:54:23,375
I don't know,
but I'm heading there now.

762
00:55:08,167 --> 00:55:10,833
I got a visual on the suspect.
Light blue Ford Econoline,

763
00:55:10,916 --> 00:55:12,125
plate number 17...

764
00:55:26,375 --> 00:55:28,625
<i>In pursuit northbound on Webster.</i>

765
00:55:29,417 --> 00:55:30,500
Make a right.

766
00:55:55,375 --> 00:55:58,542
I lost him. He's headed
westbound on Lincoln.

767
00:56:08,167 --> 00:56:09,459
Shit.

768
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:47,583
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Oh, shit!

769
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:33,958
Fuck!

770
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:10,250
You killed my partner!
You son of a bitch!

771
00:59:11,292 --> 00:59:14,666
Wrong! You got it wrong!

772
00:59:29,209 --> 00:59:30,416
Don't do it!

773
00:59:32,042 --> 00:59:34,042
I didn't kill Baker.
It was Nivens.

774
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:35,625
He shot him point-blank.

775
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:38,167
And my lady friend,
he went after her.

776
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,750
I don't know
if she's alive or dead.

777
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:43,583
Nivens put her in the hospital?

778
00:59:43,666 --> 00:59:45,458
He attacked her
at the self-storage on Milton.

779
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,666
- And why would he do that?
- She has evidence against him.

780
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:55,583
You wanna do the right thing
right now?

781
00:59:56,334 --> 00:59:58,833
You drop the gun
and let me take you in.

782
00:59:58,917 --> 01:00:01,334
We'll do it the proper way.
I'll make sure the truth comes out.

783
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:02,750
I give you my word.

784
01:00:07,541 --> 01:00:08,625
What's your name?

785
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:10,708
Meyers.

786
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,416
I talked to you
on the phone, didn't I?

787
01:00:14,125 --> 01:00:15,209
Yeah.

788
01:00:17,833 --> 01:00:20,375
- What are you thinking, Tom?
- I'm gonna make things right.

789
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:21,792
My way.

790
01:00:21,875 --> 01:00:23,334
Nivens pulled the trigger,

791
01:00:23,416 --> 01:00:26,500
but his partner, Agent Hall,
he's in on it, too.

792
01:00:27,084 --> 01:00:28,500
This is his.

793
01:01:21,084 --> 01:01:22,750
<i>Information.
How my I help you?</i>

794
01:01:22,833 --> 01:01:24,375
Grace Hospital, please.

795
01:01:24,458 --> 01:01:25,917
<i>Okay, would you like me to connect you?</i>

796
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,875
Yes, yes, please connect me.

797
01:01:29,625 --> 01:01:30,792
<i>Grace Hospital.</i>

798
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:33,291
Hi. I'm looking for Annie Wilkins.

799
01:01:33,375 --> 01:01:34,500
- <i>Wilkins?</i>
- Wilkins.

800
01:01:34,583 --> 01:01:36,708
- <i>Wilkins.</i>
- Yes. She's a patient.

801
01:01:36,792 --> 01:01:38,416
- <i>I'll connect you.</i>
- Thank you.

802
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:44,500
- Hello. Is this Annie's room?
- <i>Yes.</i>

803
01:01:45,209 --> 01:01:47,583
Great. Can she talk?

804
01:01:47,667 --> 01:01:49,500
Yes, yes, I'm family.

805
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:53,917
<i>She can't talk right now...</i>

806
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,708
But she's... she's okay?
She'll get better, right?

807
01:02:01,541 --> 01:02:04,375
Oh, good. No, no, that's fine.

808
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:06,291
I'll, uh, call back later.

809
01:02:07,042 --> 01:02:08,625
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

810
01:02:23,875 --> 01:02:25,250
What are we doing here?

811
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:29,042
Well, we need to make sure
she didn't make it.

812
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:32,708
And since you're the one
who said she didn't have a pulse,

813
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,416
you're gonna do it.

814
01:02:36,416 --> 01:02:37,542
No.

815
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:39,625
No, no chance.

816
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:43,500
This has gone way too far.
I don't want any part of this.

817
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:46,625
Fine.

818
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:55,458
But don't blame me
if your kids hate their father,

819
01:02:55,542 --> 01:02:57,583
'cause he wasn't there
when they were growing up.

820
01:04:16,042 --> 01:04:17,250
Looking for me?

821
01:04:17,959 --> 01:04:19,959
Yeah. Where's your partner?

822
01:04:20,875 --> 01:04:22,042
On his way.

823
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:23,917
Come on in. Take a seat.

824
01:04:29,917 --> 01:04:31,166
What's with the leg?

825
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:33,375
Just got thrown
out of a second-story window.

826
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:39,708
You, uh, plan on getting rid of this?

827
01:04:40,291 --> 01:04:41,583
Kind of morbid.

828
01:04:41,667 --> 01:04:42,959
Call it motivation.

829
01:04:43,875 --> 01:04:45,042
Tell me something.

830
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:47,583
This Tom Dolan,

831
01:04:47,667 --> 01:04:49,500
why is he pointing a finger at you?

832
01:04:51,458 --> 01:04:54,083
I mean, why do any of these crazies
do the things they do?

833
01:04:56,291 --> 01:04:57,458
Don't you hate that?

834
01:04:58,792 --> 01:05:00,750
Ask a question,
you get a question in return?

835
01:05:01,708 --> 01:05:03,333
All those things he said on the phone,

836
01:05:03,417 --> 01:05:06,458
stealing the money, attacking his girl,
none of that's true?

837
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:07,917
Not a bit.

838
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:13,542
- Where's the money?
- What money?

839
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:15,959
The money
my partner died for.

840
01:05:17,458 --> 01:05:20,667
The money that made
Sharon Baker a widow.

841
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,125
Well, that money
is in Tom Dolan's head.

842
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:26,250
He's got a first-class imagination.

843
01:05:28,917 --> 01:05:30,417
- You needed to see me?
- Yeah.

844
01:05:31,917 --> 01:05:33,291
I believe you lost this.

845
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:39,208
Thanks.

846
01:05:43,667 --> 01:05:45,291
- Uh, anything else?
- No, we're good.

847
01:05:50,041 --> 01:05:51,333
John, you, uh...

848
01:05:52,709 --> 01:05:54,041
You got a new plan?

849
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:00,375
Same plan, family man.

850
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:05,291
That some kind of threat?

851
01:06:08,166 --> 01:06:09,458
Does it need to be?

852
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:51,125
What's wrong?

853
01:06:53,792 --> 01:06:55,000
You awake?

854
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:58,292
I can feel your energy.
Tell me.

855
01:06:59,709 --> 01:07:01,375
Nothing.

856
01:07:01,792 --> 01:07:03,208
It's just work stuff.

857
01:07:03,625 --> 01:07:04,750
Go back to sleep.

858
01:07:05,667 --> 01:07:09,208
Whatever it is, just do what feels right,
and it'll work itself out.

859
01:07:10,917 --> 01:07:12,125
That easy, huh?

860
01:07:12,834 --> 01:07:13,958
Yeah.

861
01:07:14,875 --> 01:07:16,333
You remember who taught me that?

862
01:07:17,292 --> 01:07:18,417
No.

863
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:23,125
You.

864
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:35,375
It's just I realized I work too much.

865
01:07:36,208 --> 01:07:38,584
All I've been trying to do
is give us a good life.

866
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:42,208
You know I love you
and the boys more than anything.

867
01:07:42,292 --> 01:07:43,375
Of course I know.

868
01:07:45,584 --> 01:07:47,124
No matter what happens,

869
01:07:48,542 --> 01:07:50,416
I just want you and the boys
to remember that.

870
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:53,542
What's going on, Ramon?

871
01:08:20,709 --> 01:08:22,165
You gonna kill me?

872
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:23,957
No, Agent Hall.

873
01:08:24,041 --> 01:08:27,542
I'm a retired bank robber,
not a murderer like your partner!

874
01:08:27,624 --> 01:08:30,375
- But I do need your help!
- Why should I help you?

875
01:08:30,458 --> 01:08:32,292
Because you have the most to lose.

876
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:42,041
You and I both know
this wasn't your doing.

877
01:08:44,874 --> 01:08:46,500
But going along with Nivens,

878
01:08:47,875 --> 01:08:49,374
that was a bad idea.

879
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:55,625
It wasn't supposed
to go down like this.

880
01:08:55,708 --> 01:08:58,040
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

881
01:08:58,124 --> 01:09:00,457
But Nivens shot Baker, and I panicked.

882
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,916
I knew I was wrong,

883
01:09:03,958 --> 01:09:05,625
but at that point, I had no choice.

884
01:09:05,709 --> 01:09:08,000
Well, you have a choice now, pal.

885
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,584
What do you want?

886
01:09:10,666 --> 01:09:12,292
To prove my innocence!

887
01:09:13,709 --> 01:09:15,875
I have the security footage
from the storage place.

888
01:09:15,958 --> 01:09:18,542
- What?
- Nivens doesn't know I have it.

889
01:09:20,292 --> 01:09:22,292
I took it off your girlfriend
when he wasn't looking.

890
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:24,875
I'm gonna need that.

891
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:26,709
And I need to know where the money is.

892
01:09:33,292 --> 01:09:34,292
Annie.

893
01:09:35,333 --> 01:09:37,041
That's your girlfriend's name, right?

894
01:09:37,125 --> 01:09:38,542
Yeah.

895
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:40,542
You gotta get her out of the hospital.

896
01:09:41,417 --> 01:09:42,875
He's gonna kill her.

897
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:41,667
- Hey. You're awake.
- Tom.

898
01:10:43,916 --> 01:10:45,292
How you feeling?

899
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,208
I've been better.

900
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:52,250
I need to get you
out of here right away.

901
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:53,916
You're not safe.

902
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:58,833
Okay.

903
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:14,208
I love you.

904
01:11:17,125 --> 01:11:18,417
How could you not?

905
01:11:28,292 --> 01:11:30,167
Hold on. Hold on.

906
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:34,125
- Meyers.
- <i>It's Tom Dolan.</i>

907
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:37,958
I didn't expect that,
you kidnapping your girlfriend.

908
01:11:38,042 --> 01:11:39,666
She wasn't safe there.

909
01:11:40,584 --> 01:11:41,833
You might be right.

910
01:11:41,916 --> 01:11:43,417
Is she holed up
somewhere safe now?

911
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,916
Yeah. I want you to know
she had nothing to do with the robberies

912
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,500
and she will have
nothing to do with what comes next.

913
01:11:50,542 --> 01:11:51,750
What comes next?

914
01:11:51,833 --> 01:11:53,083
<i>It's better if you don't know.</i>

915
01:11:53,167 --> 01:11:54,500
No, it's my job to know, Tom.

916
01:11:54,584 --> 01:11:57,708
Come on, let's get together,
we talk this over.

917
01:11:57,791 --> 01:12:00,708
I'd like to, but I tried that.

918
01:12:01,542 --> 01:12:02,958
Did not work.

919
01:12:04,167 --> 01:12:06,750
Now I'm doing it
the only way I know how.

920
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:09,750
I can't persuade you
not to do whatever it is you're planning?

921
01:12:09,833 --> 01:12:11,000
<i>No.</i>

922
01:12:15,125 --> 01:12:17,542
You need anything, you or Annie,

923
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:19,375
you let me know.

924
01:12:44,459 --> 01:12:46,292
I've never
seen you work before.

925
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:52,250
Well, I know it looks complicated,

926
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:55,083
but it's not glamorous.
I mean, it's just wires,

927
01:12:56,083 --> 01:12:58,459
electrical currents, chemical reactions.

928
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:00,583
Yeah, well, glamor's overrated.

929
01:13:01,791 --> 01:13:04,292
But knowing how to
blow stuff up, that's, uh...

930
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:06,875
That's pretty cool.

931
01:13:08,125 --> 01:13:10,167
You know, if this works,

932
01:13:11,875 --> 01:13:14,833
you have to understand,
I'm still going to jail.

933
01:13:14,917 --> 01:13:16,292
I know that.

934
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:19,625
And I'll come visit you every day.

935
01:13:20,958 --> 01:13:22,125
Yeah?

936
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:25,875
- I mean, you know, until I...
- start seeing patients.

937
01:13:27,167 --> 01:13:28,750
I'm gonna be busy.

938
01:13:30,208 --> 01:13:31,833
Every other day.

939
01:13:32,125 --> 01:13:33,334
Thank you.

940
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:47,417
What are you doing?

941
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:51,417
- How did it go?
- Late night, but without incident.

942
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:53,083
You should be in bed.

943
01:13:53,666 --> 01:13:55,708
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

944
01:13:57,167 --> 01:13:58,375
It's not up for debate.

945
01:13:58,459 --> 01:14:00,042
You're right. It's too dangerous.

946
01:14:00,125 --> 01:14:01,666
Then don't do it.

947
01:14:01,958 --> 01:14:04,167
I have to finish this, Annie.

948
01:14:05,375 --> 01:14:08,791
Look, do what you have to do,
but I'm sorry, I refuse to stay here

949
01:14:08,875 --> 01:14:11,125
wondering if you're ever
gonna come back.

950
01:14:29,958 --> 01:14:31,417
What are we waiting for?

951
01:14:38,417 --> 01:14:39,708
Nivens.

952
01:14:39,791 --> 01:14:42,875
All I wanted was a chance
at a normal life for Annie and me.

953
01:14:43,833 --> 01:14:45,500
Well, it's a simple equation, Dolan.

954
01:14:45,583 --> 01:14:48,750
When you rob banks for a living,
you give up the right to a normal life.

955
01:14:48,833 --> 01:14:50,750
You're right, I screwed up.

956
01:14:50,833 --> 01:14:52,750
I took money that didn't belong to me.

957
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:56,167
And for that, I'll do my time.
But you screwed up worse.

958
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:57,541
You killed innocent people.

959
01:14:57,625 --> 01:14:58,708
Time's up. What do you want?

960
01:14:58,792 --> 01:15:00,334
You wanna talk?
You want your deal? What?

961
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:02,500
I wanna clear my name,

962
01:15:02,583 --> 01:15:05,209
which means I need
a full confession from you.

963
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:06,334
<i>That's where we're at, huh?</i>

964
01:15:06,417 --> 01:15:07,583
Well, don't you think it would be wrong

965
01:15:07,666 --> 01:15:09,750
for me to confess
to something I didn't do?

966
01:15:09,833 --> 01:15:11,583
Then you'd better
take the three million and run.

967
01:15:11,666 --> 01:15:15,125
Hey, pal, if I had
the three million, I might.

968
01:15:15,209 --> 01:15:17,750
In that case, I suggest you just run.

969
01:15:18,209 --> 01:15:19,250
Ten,

970
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:22,792
<i>nine, eight,</i>

971
01:15:24,083 --> 01:15:26,583
<i>seven, six,</i>

972
01:15:28,042 --> 01:15:29,209
<i>five,</i>

973
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:31,000
four,

974
01:15:31,792 --> 01:15:32,792
three,

975
01:15:33,958 --> 01:15:35,125
<i>two,</i>

976
01:15:35,583 --> 01:15:36,917
one.

977
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:04,000
Nice try, asshole!

978
01:16:04,084 --> 01:16:06,209
If I'd wanted you dead,
you would be.

979
01:16:06,666 --> 01:16:07,708
Ready to confess?

980
01:16:13,833 --> 01:16:14,958
Wow.

981
01:16:21,708 --> 01:16:23,292
Will you do something for me?

982
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:25,084
Anything.

983
01:16:57,625 --> 01:16:59,375
- What's up?
- <i>Change of plan.</i>

984
01:17:00,666 --> 01:17:01,666
What are you talking about?

985
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:04,708
Meyers, the girl,
this pyro-lunatic Dolan...

986
01:17:04,792 --> 01:17:06,875
Pyro? What happened?

987
01:17:07,458 --> 01:17:09,209
He blew up my fucking house.

988
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:10,292
What?

989
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:12,084
Are you deaf?
He blew up my house!

990
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:14,292
Holy crap.

991
01:17:15,917 --> 01:17:17,084
Where are you?

992
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,875
I'm at the spot.

993
01:17:19,958 --> 01:17:21,333
All right, stay put.

994
01:17:22,209 --> 01:17:24,250
- I'll meet you there.
- <i>Hurry up.</i>

995
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,000
He's not here, is he?

996
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,541
He's not a bad guy.

997
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:02,833
I know you may think that

998
01:18:02,917 --> 01:18:05,250
given everything
that's happened, but he's not.

999
01:18:05,875 --> 01:18:07,875
He's flawed, but he's a good man.

1000
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:10,333
He's got a good heart.

1001
01:18:11,708 --> 01:18:13,084
How are you feeling?

1002
01:18:14,708 --> 01:18:16,959
Better. Thank you.

1003
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:21,583
Who's your friend?

1004
01:18:23,833 --> 01:18:26,750
Oh, that's Tazzie.
She's my dog.

1005
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:29,291
Is she part of the K9 Unit?

1006
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:31,250
Yeah, I guess she is.

1007
01:18:31,333 --> 01:18:32,875
All 15 pounds of her.

1008
01:18:35,167 --> 01:18:36,750
Is there a reason why we're here?

1009
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:42,416
Security footage of Nivens and Hall
taking boxes out of this unit.

1010
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:45,583
I mean, the problem is, who's to believe
what's inside those boxes?

1011
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:49,291
- Yeah, that is a problem.
- Tom's working on that.

1012
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:51,000
But as a show of good faith...

1013
01:18:56,708 --> 01:18:58,375
he wanted you to have these.

1014
01:19:40,917 --> 01:19:42,750
- Yeah?
- It's me.

1015
01:19:44,833 --> 01:19:46,291
Where the hell you been?

1016
01:19:50,792 --> 01:19:52,416
Show me your weapon.

1017
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,708
Thumb and index finger. Slowly.

1018
01:19:58,084 --> 01:20:00,375
Back up, both of you!

1019
01:20:00,458 --> 01:20:01,792
Against the wall.

1020
01:20:05,458 --> 01:20:07,166
You're not walking
out of here with that money.

1021
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:08,625
Not yet, I'm not.

1022
01:20:08,708 --> 01:20:10,834
Are you still waiting
for that confession that's never coming?

1023
01:20:10,917 --> 01:20:13,291
I've got
the security footage, prick.

1024
01:20:13,917 --> 01:20:15,375
Yeah, sure you do.

1025
01:20:15,458 --> 01:20:16,959
Your partner gave it to me.

1026
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:22,583
Did you have it?

1027
01:20:27,667 --> 01:20:29,125
It was on the girl
who was supposed to be dead.

1028
01:20:29,208 --> 01:20:31,333
Are you stupid?
You're on that footage, too!

1029
01:20:31,416 --> 01:20:34,208
Stupid? Insane!
For going along with this.

1030
01:20:34,416 --> 01:20:36,542
Thinking that the money
made it okay.

1031
01:20:36,834 --> 01:20:39,084
- You murdered Baker!
- It was the only option!

1032
01:20:39,166 --> 01:20:40,750
He didn't deserve to die!

1033
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,792
I had a chance
to do the right thing, and I didn't do it.

1034
01:20:44,583 --> 01:20:46,042
How can I live like that?

1035
01:20:47,042 --> 01:20:50,542
How can I look my wife
and my kids in the eyes?

1036
01:20:52,708 --> 01:20:53,834
That's enough!

1037
01:20:57,333 --> 01:20:58,750
That's enough!

1038
01:20:58,834 --> 01:21:01,208
Nivens, let him go!
Let him go!

1039
01:22:13,834 --> 01:22:15,166
<i>I got you, didn't I?</i>

1040
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:17,041
I'll live.

1041
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:20,125
- How's traffic?
- <i>Traffic?</i>

1042
01:22:20,208 --> 01:22:23,333
<i>If I recall correctly,
Windsor's down to one lane.</i>

1043
01:22:25,959 --> 01:22:28,000
That a good guess,
or you tracking me?

1044
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:31,083
Just wanna
keep the collateral damage to a minimum.

1045
01:22:31,959 --> 01:22:33,250
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

1046
01:22:35,208 --> 01:22:36,500
The second bomb.

1047
01:22:40,166 --> 01:22:42,667
- Bullshit. There is no bomb.
- <i>Oh, yeah?</i>

1048
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:46,583
What, you're gonna turn
three million in cash into confetti?

1049
01:22:46,667 --> 01:22:47,959
I don't think so.

1050
01:22:48,458 --> 01:22:50,333
It's not my money anymore.

1051
01:22:50,709 --> 01:22:52,250
Check under the seat.

1052
01:23:01,041 --> 01:23:05,166
Now that you're through the tunnel,
go ahead, pull over. Take a look.

1053
01:23:20,792 --> 01:23:21,792
Shit.

1054
01:23:23,709 --> 01:23:25,458
By the way, Agent Nivens,

1055
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:27,875
<i>the bomb
is pressure sensitive.</i>

1056
01:23:27,958 --> 01:23:29,083
<i>If you get out
of that seat,</i>

1057
01:23:29,166 --> 01:23:31,667
they'll be fishing pieces
of your miserable flesh

1058
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:33,250
from the Atlantic with a net.

1059
01:23:34,041 --> 01:23:37,375
<i>I put it together on the fly,
so it's fairly unstable.</i>

1060
01:23:37,458 --> 01:23:40,709
<i>That's the trouble with IEDs,
especially homemade ones.</i>

1061
01:23:40,792 --> 01:23:43,041
<i>You never know
what's gonna set them off.</i>

1062
01:23:43,709 --> 01:23:46,417
A bump,
change in temperature, humidity.

1063
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:47,500
Hell, with that one,

1064
01:23:47,583 --> 01:23:49,250
<i>a good sneeze could trigger it.</i>

1065
01:23:51,917 --> 01:23:56,125
If I were you, I'd sit tight
and wait for the bomb squad.

1066
01:25:20,709 --> 01:25:21,834
What's happened?

1067
01:25:22,584 --> 01:25:23,750
It's a dud.

1068
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,458
No detonator.

1069
01:25:25,542 --> 01:25:27,875
You could bang that thing
with a hammer all day long,

1070
01:25:27,958 --> 01:25:29,167
wouldn't go off.

1071
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:31,375
You lucked out.

1072
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:35,417
Arrest him.

1073
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,250
You heard me.

1074
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:12,542
Good girl.

1075
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:14,500
You want a cookie?

1076
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:34,125
<i>It was on the girl
who was supposed to be dead.</i>

1077
01:26:34,208 --> 01:26:36,208
<i>Are you stupid?
You're on that footage, too!</i>

1078
01:26:36,292 --> 01:26:39,208
<i>Stupid? Insane!
For going along with this.</i>

1079
01:26:39,292 --> 01:26:41,584
<i>Thinking that the money
made it okay.</i>

1080
01:26:41,667 --> 01:26:44,000
- <i>You murdered Baker!</i>
- <i>It was the only option!</i>

1081
01:26:44,083 --> 01:26:45,750
<i>He didn't deserve to die!</i>

1082
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:50,000
<i>I had a chance
to do the right thing, and I didn't do it.</i>

1083
01:26:51,916 --> 01:26:53,417
<i>How can I live like that?</i>

1084
01:26:54,333 --> 01:26:57,750
<i>How can I look my wife
and my kids in the eyes?</i>

1085
01:27:00,292 --> 01:27:01,292
<i>That's enough!</i>

1086
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:05,292
<i>That's enough!</i>

1087
01:27:05,375 --> 01:27:07,250
<i>Nivens, let him go!</i>

1088
01:27:07,875 --> 01:27:08,916
<i>Let him go!</i>

1089
01:27:40,542 --> 01:27:42,750
- Annie.
- Did you listen to it?

1090
01:27:42,833 --> 01:27:43,875
I did.

1091
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:45,542
Will you go easy on him?

1092
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,208
I'll do my best.

1093
01:27:55,208 --> 01:27:56,459
It's for you.

1094
01:28:01,916 --> 01:28:03,000
Tom?

1095
01:28:03,708 --> 01:28:05,208
<i>Yeah, it's me.</i>

1096
01:28:06,833 --> 01:28:08,875
Taking down Nivens the way you did...

1097
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:10,833
Impressive work.

1098
01:28:10,916 --> 01:28:13,292
Circumstances were different,
I'd be offering you a job.

1099
01:28:13,375 --> 01:28:16,417
<i>Circumstances were different,
I might accept.</i>

1100
01:28:17,791 --> 01:28:19,417
<i>I wanna turn myself in.</i>

1101
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:23,791
All right. How do you wanna play it?

1102
01:28:24,208 --> 01:28:26,000
<i>Play time's over, my friend.</i>

1103
01:28:27,083 --> 01:28:28,334
<i>Look to your left.</i>

1104
01:28:54,167 --> 01:28:57,000
The bomb in Nivens' car?

1105
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:00,250
Not my best.

1106
01:29:00,334 --> 01:29:02,083
You forgot the detonator.

1107
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:04,334
Ah, I knew I forgot something.

1108
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:07,791
I was under a lot of stress.

1109
01:29:08,584 --> 01:29:10,584
So much for being the Precise Bandit.

1110
01:29:14,292 --> 01:29:15,750
You find the rest of the cash?

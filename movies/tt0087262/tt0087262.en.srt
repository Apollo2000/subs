2
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:04,758
Don't push me.

3
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,428
Stick with him. Don't let
him get too far ahead.

4
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:13,215
- Daddy, I'm tired. Can't we stop?
- Not yet, honey.

5
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:17,845
There isn't any people on the
side streets. And they're darker.

6
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,680
That's just what
they'd want, honey.

7
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,432
Daddy, I'm scared.

8
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:26,145
So am I, honey. Hang on.
Be light. Be a feather.

9
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,898
- What's going on?
- Excuse me!

10
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,734
Oh, he's seen us. Whatever
you do, no eye contact.

11
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,863
- He can make you do what he wants.
- Got it.

12
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,575
See him? He just got lost
in that crowd there.

13
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,995
That's him, over on the right.
Right there on the right.

14
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,090
Maybe I can cut him
off at the corner.

15
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,762
Let's get him.

16
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,306
Daddy, they're coming.

17
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,817
Taxi. Taxi.

18
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,614
Drive.

19
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,944
- Stop!
- Hey, stop the car! Hey, cabbie.

20
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:18,119
Don't pay any attention
to them. Just drive.

21
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:24,453
Come on, let's get back to the
car. We can chase them down.

22
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,297
Let's move it.

23
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,874
Hey, mister, where are we going?

24
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,334
The airport.

25
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:35,297
Wait, wait, I can't go to
the airport. It's too far.

26
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,799
Look...

27
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,639
I'm gonna give you a $500 bill.

28
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,642
I want you to take my daughter
and I to the airport.

29
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,978
Sure, sure. Okay, mister.

30
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,901
Drive.

31
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,155
I ain't turning down no $500.

32
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:17,214
We are going to give each one of you ten
young ladies and gentlemen an injection.

33
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:21,177
Five of these injections
will be water.

34
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,679
Five of them will be
water mixed with

35
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,098
a tiny amount of a
chemical compound

36
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:31,150
which we call "Lot Six."

37
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,899
The exact nature of this
compound is classified

38
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,701
but it is essentially a
hypnotic mild hallucinogenic.

39
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:45,201
We employ the double-blind method
of administering the compound,

40
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:49,246
which is to say that
neither you nor we

41
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:53,751
know who has received the
clear dose and who has not.

42
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,212
Until later, that is.

43
00:04:56,213 --> 00:05:01,884
You will be under close supervision
for 48 hours after the experiment.

44
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,221
Are there any questions?

45
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:10,228
Uh, Dr. Wanless, is this
experiment being done by The Shop?

46
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,941
No.

47
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,571
Absolutely not.

48
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,066
Yes?

49
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,567
When do I get my money?

50
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,069
Right on, man.

51
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,570
That is important.

52
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,491
Well, immediately after the experiment,
along with all the other students.

53
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,124
I'm broke too.

54
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:33,250
So, if we may begin the
injections now, please.

55
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,970
Andy McGee.

56
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:44,760
I'm Vicky Tomlinson. I'm a little
nervous about this, Andy McGee.

57
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,304
What if I go on a bad trip?

58
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,274
We'll probably just
get distilled water.

59
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,116
Feel any pain?

60
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:11,622
I feel a pressure.
It's a bad pressure.

61
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,125
It will pass.

62
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,795
How are you feeling?

63
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,172
When do we start to shrink?

64
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,176
You believe you're going to shrink?

65
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:33,277
Sh-ri-nk...

66
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,526
You'll be fine.

67
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,743
We'll be fine.

68
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,541
I can't feel my hands.

69
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:01,672
Thank you. What a nice compliment.

70
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,589
I didn't say anything.

71
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,842
You did.

72
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,178
What'd I say?

73
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,388
You said my hair is beautiful.

74
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,724
Like copper set on fire.

75
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,353
Yeah.

76
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:21,862
But I didn't say that.
I just thought it.

77
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:29,531
<i>I love you. I've always loved you.</i>

78
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,367
<i>I've known you for
a thousand years.</i>

79
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,202
<i>That long?</i>

80
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,582
<i>Yes, I've loved you too.</i>

81
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:12,658
Hey, buddy, airport. You okay?

82
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:18,580
I got a headache.
Wake up, baby doll.

83
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,917
We're here. Come on.

84
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,962
Where are we?

85
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:28,137
Hanover, sweetheart. Airport.

86
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,426
Try the airport.

87
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,349
Roger.

88
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:47,776
Suppose we catch up with him.
Do you wanna face him down?

89
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:52,656
What do you call this thing he's
got? How he pushes people.

90
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,701
The Shop figures he may
be running down by now.

91
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,871
He's overdone it before
and wound up in bed.

92
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,123
It's doing something to his brain.

93
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,208
Like what?

94
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,880
Giving himself pinprick
hemorrhages, maybe?

95
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,673
It could kill him.

96
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,847
Good, let's hope.

97
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,812
We don't have any more money and
we don't have anything left to sell.

98
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,023
We can't stay here.

99
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:30,069
It's not right. It's
not right to steal.

100
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:35,491
Honey, I know, but it's not right for
them to keep coming after us, either.

101
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:39,203
Now, I explained that to you,
Charlie, at least I tried.

102
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,247
About the big bad
and the little bad?

103
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,250
That's right. Lesser
and greater evil.

104
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,212
Big bad is what I did to Mommy?

105
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:51,173
Oh, darling, please.

106
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:54,176
Don't. Don't, baby.

107
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:57,346
I made Mommy scream.

108
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,941
Shh...

109
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,203
Does your head still hurt?

110
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,581
Poor Daddy.

111
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,291
Gotta keep a lookout.

112
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,214
Okay.

113
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,385
I don't know what you're doing here.
We've been through this 100 times.

114
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,428
I don't want to have
anything to do with you.

115
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,389
I told you not to follow me here.

116
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:45,769
Besides, it's not my fault.
I'm not responsible.

117
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,604
This ain't got nothing
to do with me.

118
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,065
- I'm not the only guy you've been seeing.
- That's not true.

119
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:54,867
I'm not ready to get married, so
why don't you just get outta here?

120
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,114
Why don't you just stop bugging me?

121
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,824
Come on, Charlie.

122
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,034
You told me you loved me.

123
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:04,459
You told me if anything
happened you'd take care of me.

124
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,481
This ain't got nothing
to do with me.

125
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,692
We've been through this 100 times.
I don't want you around.

126
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:39,290
I'm not responsible. Look,
I told you not to follow me here.

127
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:44,580
But I can't do it on my own.
I don't know where to go.

128
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,705
I don't have any money.

129
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,540
I'm not the only guy
you've been with.

130
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,710
That's not true.

131
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,505
I swear to God you're the only one.
I've never slept with anyone else.

132
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:59,010
That's not what my
buddy Al told me...

133
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,991
I didn't mean it, Daddy.

134
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,746
All right, buddy, come outta there.

135
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,748
Mind waiting till I
put my feet out?

136
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,751
I was coming with you and I saw him

137
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,712
and before I could stop
it, it just happened.

138
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,924
- I didn't like him and it just got away.
- It's okay, honey.

139
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,842
- But I set him on fire!
- Charlie.

140
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:44,721
- I didn't mean it, Daddy.
- Charlie, stop it.

141
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:49,851
I want you to listen to me. You said
it got away from you and it did.

142
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:55,107
But not like before. It
just got away a little bit.

143
00:12:55,108 --> 00:13:00,404
Charlie, you might've set that
man's face on fire or his hair.

144
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,865
Now, it always goes out at
somebody you don't like.

145
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,243
But you didn't really
hurt that guy.

146
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,620
Not like I hurt Mommy
in the kitchen.

147
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:14,048
Baby. Baby, you've got to
stop thinking about that.

148
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,629
It wasn't you that really hurt
Mommy. It wasn't you that...

149
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,633
That killed her.

150
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:33,320
That's right. That's right.

151
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,315
Now...

152
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,944
We've got to go on.

153
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,572
Single file. Just like the Indians.

154
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:47,919
And keep as far over to the side
of the road as you can, okay?

155
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,059
I seen them both. This guy looked
kind of sick, or something.

156
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,685
Are you okay?

157
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,104
So far, so good, baby.
You getting tired?

158
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,523
Nope.

159
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:23,495
Daddy, I feel those bad men
from The Shop around again.

160
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,875
Okay. Come on.

161
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,127
Okay, sweetheart, come on.

162
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,638
Head up Route 70.

163
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,973
Oh, Daddy!

164
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,224
Daddy, get up.

165
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,695
Daddy, wake up.

166
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,157
Daddy? Daddy?

167
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,706
Are you all right?

168
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,380
I thought you were dead.

169
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,090
Are you kidding?

170
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:30,597
Think I'd do that to you? You're
all I've got in this world.

171
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:36,027
But I'm happy about that
'cause I'm crazy about you.

172
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,063
I'm crazy about you too, Daddy.

173
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,533
Come on. We gotta find
a place to sleep.

174
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,745
We can afford it now.

175
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,516
I burned him.

176
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,060
Rest, sweetheart.

177
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,606
You didn't hurt him.
You controlled it.

178
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,201
Shh...

179
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:35,744
Okay, Charlie. Now,
let it out. Easy does it.

180
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,914
Let it go.

181
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,667
Attagirl.

182
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,336
Attagirl. Okay.

183
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,839
Now pull it back.

184
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,845
Pull it back, Charlie.
Pull it back, Charlie.

185
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,440
Good Lord.

186
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,272
Now, you've got to
learn to control that.

187
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,776
You gotta try real hard. Okay?

188
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,819
I couldn't help it.

189
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,863
Tomorrow. She's tired.

190
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:16,326
Time for bed. You can
try again at breakfast.

191
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:19,037
I want to do that again.

192
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,539
No, tomorrow.

193
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,792
I'm not tired.
I want to do it again.

194
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,377
I said no.

195
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,300
Again. Now!

196
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,805
I'm sorry, Mommy. I didn't mean it.

197
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,307
Well, you did it. You
hurt your mother.

198
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,726
I'm sorry, Mommy.

199
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,145
It's all right. Mommy's all right.

200
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,898
Charlie, you have got
to control this thing

201
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,068
because it's a bad thing, you
understand me? A bad thing.

202
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,279
Leave her alone.
It's not her fault.

203
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,657
Hello?

204
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,375
Sorry.

205
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,581
Hung up again?

206
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,207
Whoever it is.

207
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:09,680
We know who they are and they want to
make sure we're staying right here.

208
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,101
<i>Vicky? Charlie?</i>

209
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,433
I'm home.

210
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,028
Sweetheart?

211
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,707
Vicky!

212
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,060
Oh...

213
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,279
Oh, no.

214
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:13,568
Oh, no. Please, please, God.

215
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,820
Please don't be here.

216
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,244
Please don't...

217
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:22,586
Oh, no! Please, no, no!

218
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:27,165
No! Oh, babe! What did they do?

219
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:31,762
What did they do? They
put this in your mouth.

220
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,023
Where's Charlie? Charlie!

221
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,602
Charlie!

222
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:53,777
Charlie!

223
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,449
Charlie!

224
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,043
Charlie!

225
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,635
Joan, by any chance is
my daughter with you?

226
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,139
<i>Hold her!</i>

227
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,318
Okay, that's far enough.

228
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,871
Drop the gun.

229
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,505
Drop it.

230
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:55,095
Bring her to me.

231
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,019
You're blind.

232
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,532
Ahh! My eyes!

233
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:22,989
You too, you son of a bitch.
You killed my wife. You're blind.

234
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,036
My eyes! My eyes!

235
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:31,711
Oh, my God! Leon!

236
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,167
Andy!

237
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,627
My eyes!

238
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,254
Joan.

239
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:44,436
Go back inside the house. You
won't remember any of this.

240
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,564
Leon! Oh, God!

241
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:51,476
My eyes! Son of a bitch!

242
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,775
Can't see!

243
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,287
Wake up, baby.
It's time to move on.

244
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:14,416
Morning.

245
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,814
Duane. Morning, Josie.

246
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,440
Good morning.

247
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,819
Jamieson called in. No word yet
on the McGees. He'll ring later.

248
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,863
Put him right through when he does.

249
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:48,324
And Rainbird is in your office.

250
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,827
- When did he get back?
- This morning.

251
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,465
- Morning, Kenny.
- Morning, sir.

252
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:26,070
Welcome back, Rainbird.

253
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,655
How was Venice?

254
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,579
Sinking.

255
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,495
Is our problem there solved?

256
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:38,170
Our problem there is solved.

257
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,209
Dr. Wanless is here.

258
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,712
Christ, there goes a beautiful day.

259
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:50,179
Ah, the good doctor.
What do you want, Joe?

260
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,016
Have you caught them yet?

261
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,518
We'll catch them. What do you want?

262
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:02,357
What do I always want?
Why do I stay alive?

263
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:05,443
To try to persuade you
to sanction them both,

264
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,743
expunge them, wipe them
from the face of the earth.

265
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,982
Andrew McGee and his daughter
constitute the greatest...

266
00:24:15,008 --> 00:24:18,665
- ...threat that's confronted this nation.
- That's a lot of crap.

267
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,588
You feel guilt!

268
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:24,754
Eight out of ten of our young volunteers
have died, committed suicide.

269
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:28,424
You want to justify
your participation.

270
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,927
You were all in favor
of it at the time.

271
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,602
I know.

272
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,611
I didn't realize.

273
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,824
None of us did.

274
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:51,823
Lot Six was nothing more than a
synthetic copy of pituitary extract.

275
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,866
A powerful painkiller hallucinogen.

276
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:57,997
For God's sake, Joe, don't
start again. Come on.

277
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,516
You see...

278
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,353
You see...

279
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:19,809
This pituitary extract is responsible for
the occasional flashes of psi ability

280
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,189
which most human beings
demonstrate from time to time.

281
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:27,608
Precognition, telekinesis,
mental domination,

282
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,819
the kind of domination that this

283
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,155
experiment brought
out in Andrew McGee.

284
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,449
What is the point, Doctor?

285
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,451
Ever since this child was born,

286
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:39,328
her father has been trying to
inhibit her use of those powers.

287
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:45,927
But what if his control
had weakened now?

288
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:50,715
Why would he lose control
now after all these years?

289
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:53,009
Ask yourself this question.

290
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:58,681
How exhausting must it have been
for Victoria and Andrew McGee

291
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,184
when this child was an infant?

292
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:04,312
The bottle is late. The baby cries.

293
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:08,816
And at that moment, one of her stuffed
toys right there in the crib beside her

294
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,661
bursts into smoky flame.

295
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:15,198
Joe, she's just a little girl.
She can light fires, yes,

296
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,366
but you're making her
sound like Armageddon.

297
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,993
Yes.

298
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,996
And that's what it might well be.

299
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,922
Suppose lighting fires is
merely the tip of the iceberg.

300
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,882
I don't know what
you're talking about.

301
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,173
I am talking about a talent
that is directly linked

302
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:36,260
to this child's pituitary gland,
undeveloped pituitary gland.

303
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:41,349
What happens when she becomes
adolescent and that sleeping gland wakes

304
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:45,229
and becomes, for 20 months, the most
powerful force in the human body?

305
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:51,761
Suppose we have a child
here who some day...

306
00:26:51,787 --> 00:26:57,407
is capable of creating a nuclear explosion
simply by the power of her will.

307
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:02,337
- That's insane.
- Is it? Is it?

308
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:06,207
Then allow me to progress from
insanity to utter lunacy.

309
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:10,920
Suppose there is a little girl out
there somewhere today, this morning,

310
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:17,218
who has within her, lying
dormant at present,

311
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:21,097
the power some day to crack
the very planet in two,

312
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:24,693
like a china plate in
a shooting gallery.

313
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:37,238
What if we could train this
little girl? And others as well.

314
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,407
Could we ever have
more powerful weapons?

315
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,951
No! No more experiments.

316
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,744
Don't force me to
go above your head

317
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,454
because I swear to
you I will if I have to.

318
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:48,378
I'll have you and this entire
establishment eliminated.

319
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,928
An excitable man.

320
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,442
Where are we gonna go now?

321
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:17,412
Well, we're gonna have to find
some place to stay for a while.

322
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,238
I don't know if
anybody'll believe us,

323
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,699
but if we send letters to
the important newspapers

324
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,123
maybe The Shop will
have to lay off.

325
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:29,215
We could go to Granther's.

326
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,709
What made you think of that?

327
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,628
I don't know.

328
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:38,259
'Cause I was thinking about your
grandfather not five minutes ago.

329
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,810
We'll check the motel. I want you
to work the road further down.

330
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,312
Got it.

331
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:00,321
Well... That's a
pretty little miss.

332
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:01,656
What's your name, missy?

333
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:03,366
Roberta.

334
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,826
Well, Bobby, where are you
headed for this morning?

335
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,329
Well, we're headed for
Tennessee. Knoxville.

336
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:10,373
My wife's there
visiting her sister.

337
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:11,499
Ran into a little problem.

338
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,583
Did she now?

339
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:17,338
Yeah, labor. This one's got a new
baby brother, 1:40 this morning.

340
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,757
His name's Andy. Isn't
that a nice name?

341
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,176
I think it's a corker.

342
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,470
Mine's Irv Manders. Come on in now.

343
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,349
I'll get you 10 miles closer
to Knoxville, anyway.

344
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,709
- Hey, Al, it's them.
- You're joking?

345
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,876
No, damn it, it's them.

346
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,378
- Did you get the number?
- Yeah, I got it.

347
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,504
Did you see which way they went?

348
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,226
- Well, I didn't even see them check out.
- Try to remember the time.

349
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,227
Hey, we got them.

350
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:19,483
Why don't you two come home,
take lunch with me and the wife?

351
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,908
- Oh, we couldn't...
- Daddy, I'm starving.

352
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,740
Are you sure you got enough?

353
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,993
Always, and I'm glad to have you.

354
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,494
Thank you very much.

355
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,621
My pleasure, Bobby.

356
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:36,125
It'll be my wife's too when
she gets a look at you.

357
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:39,420
Always wanted a
little girl herself.

358
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,595
But I guess that wasn't to be.

359
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:49,513
Got a song for you.

360
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,849
<i>Oh, there was an old hen
She had a wooden leg</i>

361
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,185
<i>Finest old hen that
ever laid an egg</i>

362
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,771
<i>She laid her eggs all over the farm</i>

363
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:59,315
<i>Another little drink
won't do us any harm</i>

364
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,126
Who'd you bring home, Irv?

365
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,795
This little girl is Roberta.

366
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:23,130
This young fella here's her daddy.

367
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:26,384
I didn't catch his name yet so
I don't know if we're related.

368
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,302
Frank Burton, ma'am.

369
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,521
Hello, I'm Norma Manders.

370
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,640
Hi.

371
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,643
Hello.

372
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,982
Your husband was nice enough to invite
us back for lunch. Hope you don't mind.

373
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,827
Why, sure. Come on in.

374
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:49,033
Come on, Bobby. Feedbag.

375
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:23,858
More room out than
there is in, button.

376
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,861
If I eat any more,
I think I'll split.

377
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,909
That's what my mom used to...

378
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:34,544
I mean, that's what
she always says.

379
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,875
Norma, why don't you and Bobby
go out and feed those chickens?

380
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:43,344
I want to have a little
talk with Frank here.

381
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:46,755
Would you like that?

382
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,215
Do they peck?

383
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,051
Only what they eat, honey.

384
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,428
Come on.

385
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,226
Okay. Goody.

386
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,403
Want a beer, Frank?

387
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:05,316
It isn't Frank, but I
guess you know that.

388
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:08,652
I guess I did.

389
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,076
- What is your name?
- Andy.

390
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,074
Well, Andy, what about that beer?

391
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:16,285
I guess I could use it.

392
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:18,914
You got it.

393
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,586
There you go.

394
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,421
Thank you.

395
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,039
- Here, let me help.
- No, that's all right.

396
00:33:30,065 --> 00:33:31,872
I know this routine.

397
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,352
Cops after you, Andy?

398
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,981
Sort of cops, yeah.

399
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,816
You snatch that little
girl from her mother?

400
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:53,197
No, she's my daughter, but her
mother didn't set the cops on us.

401
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,826
Her mother's been dead for a year.

402
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,587
Don't appear like you got
her against her will.

403
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:05,042
What do they want you
for, anyway, Andy?

404
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,502
Who are they?

405
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:07,962
Government agents.

406
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,964
FBI?

407
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:11,840
No, The Shop.

408
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,809
The Shop?

409
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:20,104
Yeah, it's really the Department
of Scientific Intelligence. DSI.

410
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:25,479
My daughter, Charlene
and I, Charlie,

411
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:31,026
we were part of an experiment
that happened a long time ago.

412
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,996
Tell me about it.

413
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:37,032
Okay, now go ahead.

414
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:40,202
Thank you. Do you
eat these chickens?

415
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:44,549
If I can catch one, I might
eat one. We eat the eggs.

416
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,876
They want to examine
her and study her.

417
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:51,347
So they can figure out just what makes
her able to do what she can do.

418
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:55,260
I think they want to use her to
reactivate the Lot Six program.

419
00:34:56,386 --> 00:35:00,389
Andy, I think you ought to call
the police. Turn yourself in.

420
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,766
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy.

421
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,520
As crazy as anything
I've ever heard.

422
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:08,861
Daddy, I fed the...

423
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,735
You told.

424
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:15,989
Daddy, why'd you tell?

425
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:23,246
<i>They're coming.
They're coming for us.</i>

426
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:32,973
They're gonna kill you, Daddy. We have
to run, we have to hide, we have to...

427
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:37,760
Yes, yes, that's what they want
to do. They want to kill you.

428
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:41,305
Kill you like they did Mommy and
take me away. I won't let it happen.

429
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:45,731
Holy Jesus Christ. Did she do that?

430
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:51,407
Charlie, now, watch
what you're doing.

431
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,610
Is it too late?

432
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:58,581
Yes, they're coming
up the dirt road now.

433
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,251
Daddy, I'm scared.

434
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,999
Charlie, you can stop them.

435
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:11,757
If I do something bad,
will you still love me?

436
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,130
Oh, Charlie...

437
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,965
Of course I'll still love you.

438
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:21,471
I love you more than anything in
the world, no matter what happens.

439
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,853
I got some tall apologizing to do.

440
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,189
There's a line of cars
coming up the road.

441
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,317
I'll stand with you if you
want. I'll get my deer gun.

442
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,991
You don't need your gun.

443
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:14,657
Hi, Andy. Hi, Charlie.

444
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,151
Honey, you don't
have to run anymore.

445
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,529
Go away.

446
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:23,490
Afraid I can't do that,
honey. I have my orders.

447
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,576
No one wants to hurt
you or your daddy.

448
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:29,752
You liar, you're supposed
to kill him and I know it.

449
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:33,667
I'd advise you do what
my daughter says.

450
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:37,513
You know why she's wanted.
Remember the soldier at the airport?

451
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:44,178
You men are trespassing. I want
you to get the hell off my property.

452
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:46,346
We're government agents, sir.

453
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:50,017
These two folks are wanted
for questioning. Nothing more.

454
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:53,228
I don't care if they're wanted
for assassinating the president.

455
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,522
Show me a warrant or get
the hell off my land.

456
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,774
We don't need a warrant.

457
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,118
You do unless I woke up
in Russia this morning.

458
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:03,238
If you'll just get in the car,
we can discuss all this.

459
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,533
Honest to gosh, there's nothing
going on here, except...

460
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,328
We know what's going on.

461
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:12,039
Please, don't make me do anything.

462
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:30,390
Get out! Don't you understand what
she's doing? Can't you feel it?

463
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,060
Don't be stupid.

464
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:35,062
If we can only discuss
this, please.

465
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,396
Get him!

466
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,069
Watch it, Andy. Watch it.

467
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:42,491
Not the girl. Not the girl.

468
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,165
Help! Help!

469
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,963
Help me!

470
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,595
No, don't.

471
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,718
No, don't.

472
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,051
No! Don't!

473
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,985
Now, get out of here.

474
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:26,706
She's never done anything like this
before. I don't know if she can stop.

475
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,866
Get out. Get out.

476
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,296
Go! Go!

477
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,718
Help me!

478
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,066
- Let's go!
- Don't leave me!

479
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:57,978
Charlie.

480
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,704
Stop it. That's enough.

481
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:18,415
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

482
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,010
Sorry, Daddy.

483
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,263
Let's get outta here,
back to The Shop.

484
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,187
Go, go, go!

485
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:47,203
Oh, my God.

486
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:54,368
Andy. There's an old Willys
Jeep out behind the barn.

487
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:57,621
No, Irv, don't get
involved any deeper.

488
00:40:57,622 --> 00:41:00,040
Those men came here without
any warrants at all,

489
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:04,252
tried to take them off our
land, one of them shot me.

490
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,631
What do you want me to do? Sit here and
turn them over to the secret police?

491
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:12,094
They'll be getting their peckers up
enough to come back. Be a good Nazi?

492
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,638
I guess not.

493
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,099
You don't have to do anything else.

494
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,602
No, please, take the
Jeep and get away.

495
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:23,231
Just get away.

496
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,854
Charlie.

497
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:07,985
There's the lake. We're here.

498
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:06,333
Come on, Charlie. We got
a lot of cleaning up to do.

499
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:10,253
Nobody's lived here since
your grandfather died.

500
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,678
I hope that key's still here.

501
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:33,068
Do you think they'll find us here?

502
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:35,487
After what you did at the farm,

503
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:38,207
I think they're gonna
stay pretty far away.

504
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,867
If they still want to capture us,

505
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:45,413
they're gonna have to figure
out a different way to do it.

506
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:49,259
Well, anyways, we've
got us a new home.

507
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:53,389
Let's go. Let's go.

508
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,800
Don't it look good?

509
00:43:56,801 --> 00:44:00,554
Daddy, will things ever
be the same for us again?

510
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:03,558
Will I be able to go to
school, and things, again?

511
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,561
Sure you can.

512
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:10,188
After you write the letters, right?

513
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,232
That's right.

514
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,451
Tell the newspapers all about it.

515
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:18,405
Then the running'll be over.

516
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:21,705
We'll live normal lives,
like everybody else.

517
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,915
Can I be?

518
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,667
What?

519
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,961
Like everybody else?

520
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:35,635
Darn tootin' you can.

521
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,306
I want to be.

522
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,727
Look who's here.

523
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,357
How do you feel?

524
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,326
Safe.

525
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,748
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Daddy.

526
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,349
Do you have a phone here?

527
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,898
Right over here.

528
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,695
<i>They're here. They
mailed some letters.</i>

529
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:23,446
All right, good deal.

530
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:27,575
Get a hold of Bates. He can be there
in an hour and keep me informed.

531
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,703
- Mr. McGee?
- And Miss McGee.

532
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:32,872
- Where are they?
- The summer cottage near Bradford.

533
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,626
- I'll bring them here.
- Oh, just like that?

534
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,669
You know what that
little girl can do.

535
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:41,089
I know what the little girl can do.
That's why I'll bring her here.

536
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:44,987
So you can do all your
tests. On the condition...

537
00:46:45,013 --> 00:46:48,990
that you give her to me for disposal
when you're finished with her.

538
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,982
What?

539
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,835
I want her when you've
finished with her.

540
00:46:53,836 --> 00:46:55,729
You are mad.

541
00:46:55,730 --> 00:47:00,400
How right you are. So are
you, mad as a hatter.

542
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:05,071
You sit here making plans for controlling
a force that's beyond your comprehension.

543
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,574
A force that belongs only
to the gods themselves.

544
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:09,497
What the hell are
you talking about?

545
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,667
Things I'm sure you wouldn't
want the world to know.

546
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:20,253
What's to stop me from having
you erased right here and now?

547
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,421
Hmm.

548
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:27,594
My word that I've already made certain
provisions that, should I disappear,

549
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:30,638
The Shop will cease to
exist within six weeks.

550
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,933
And within six months, you will
stand in front of a judge,

551
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:39,272
awaiting sentence for crimes serious
enough to keep you behind bars

552
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,320
for the rest of your life.

553
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,537
Just, um...

554
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,998
What is it you want?

555
00:47:56,999 --> 00:48:00,877
Your word that my involvement
with this child Charlene

556
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,879
will not end when I bring her here.

557
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,882
That's just the beginning. We're
going to be friends, Captain.

558
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,300
We haven't got her yet.

559
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,144
We'll have her.

560
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,141
All right.

561
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:19,646
I guess we've got a deal,
but why do you want her?

562
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:22,149
She's very beautiful.
She's very young.

563
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:26,237
Yet inside her is the
power of the gods.

564
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:29,864
We're going to be close, she and I.

565
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:33,619
Oh, yes. Gonna be very close.

566
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:38,331
Reel in some of the
slack out of the line.

567
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:42,377
Real slow, come on in, a little
more. Reel in. Reel it.

568
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:46,089
Okay, now give it a little
tug. Attagirl, now reel.

569
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:49,342
Yes, sirree! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

570
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,844
A real whopper.

571
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,387
Lookee here. How about that?

572
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,248
Here he comes.

573
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:22,208
Saved by the Postal Department.

574
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,294
- What seems to be the trouble?
- Am I glad to see you.

575
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:25,545
I think we got a dead battery.

576
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:27,464
I was hoping maybe you could
give us a jump or something?

577
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,340
Let's take a look at it. It
might not be the battery.

578
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:32,190
Thanks a lot, I really
appreciate it.

579
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:37,450
Where will we go now?

580
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,827
Offices of The New York Times.

581
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:42,121
But you sent them a letter.

582
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:45,458
Well, they might not have
gotten it, sweetheart.

583
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,961
Do you think they took them?

584
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:50,556
No!

585
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,490
- I'll get it, baby.
- I can do it!

586
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:18,658
Baby, baby, come on,
now. It's almost over.

587
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:20,827
It's never gonna be over!

588
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:23,830
- It's not over.
- Come on.

589
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,873
No, it's not.

590
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,875
Yes, it is. Come here.

591
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,675
Are you ready to go?

592
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,010
I guess so.

593
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:41,014
Daddy, I'm never gonna start
another fire in my life.

594
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:44,225
Even if they come
before we can get away.

595
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:48,271
I'm never gonna hurt
another person in my life.

596
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:52,402
That's okay, Charlie.
I can understand that.

597
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:55,695
Okay.

598
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:57,071
Jump.

599
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:59,700
That's a big girl.

600
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,721
Okay...

601
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:55,427
Charlie? Charlie! Charlie!

602
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:03,680
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

603
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:06,432
Who shot my daughter?

604
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:11,109
Come on out where I can
see you, you son of a bitch.

605
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:14,274
Baby.

606
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:17,212
Nothing to it.

607
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,894
Charlie!

608
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:19,241
She's all right, Mr. McGee.
Take it easy.

609
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:28,908
Where is she? I want to see her.

610
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:32,787
All in good time.
First, let's talk.

611
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:35,837
Let's get acquainted.

612
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:39,086
Go to hell.

613
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:42,965
I tell you, she's
gonna be all right.

614
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:52,014
No. No.

615
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,366
What do you want with us?

616
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,201
I told you, Mr. McGee.

617
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:15,955
We are going to be spending
considerable time with each other,

618
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:19,000
and I want to introduce myself.

619
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:21,544
I'm Dr. Pynchot.

620
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:26,016
I'm going to make sure
you're treated well here.

621
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,978
Is this The Shop?

622
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:38,020
This is The Shop.

623
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,398
Hi, Charlene.

624
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,317
I'm Captain Hollister.
May I come in?

625
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:28,536
Where's my daddy?

626
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:34,496
I brought you some cocoa.

627
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:44,669
I don't want anything.

628
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:48,515
There's nothing to be
afraid of. Here.

629
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:51,927
You see? Go on.

630
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:57,516
Well, maybe later.

631
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:04,197
I've been looking forward to
meeting you for a long time.

632
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:06,399
I know you may not believe this,

633
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,746
but I've actually begun to think
of you as my own daughter.

634
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,572
What have you done to my father?

635
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,950
He's resting and he's
fine, just like you.

636
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:18,577
He knows you're all right
and he sends his love

637
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,705
and he wants you to
cooperate with us.

638
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:22,423
You're a liar.

639
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:25,918
Now, what kind of talk is that
from a nice little girl like you?

640
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,545
Go to hell!

641
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:29,514
Oh?

642
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,258
A very stubborn nice little girl.

643
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:34,427
That's all right, I understand.

644
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:37,388
I know you're tired and you're not quite
sure where you are or why you're here.

645
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:39,098
So I just want to ease
your mind, Charlie.

646
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:41,272
Do you mind if I call you Charlie?

647
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,981
All right, Charlene.

648
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:51,277
You are here because I'm very
interested in this ability that you have.

649
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:53,320
Pyrokinesis.

650
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,613
Yes.

651
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:59,285
All of us here are interested in that and
we want to see how far you can take it.

652
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:01,288
I'll tell you this, Charlie,

653
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:03,789
you'll be doing this great country
of ours a really big favor

654
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,791
if you just cooperate with us.

655
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:11,423
I said I would never start another fire
in my life. I want to see my father.

656
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:16,302
Okay.

657
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:17,511
Um...

658
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:20,310
Why don't you drink the
cocoa and get some sleep?

659
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:24,979
If there's anything you want, just
pick up the phone and let us know.

660
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,982
I know you'll find this hard
to believe now, Charlie,

661
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,656
but you and me are gonna be pals.

662
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:34,453
Never.

663
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,199
Never say never.

664
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,828
I'll see you, Charlie.

665
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:46,549
Good night, Charlie.

666
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:06,519
Just back off. Back off.

667
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,978
No!

668
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:10,527
You're not gonna do it.

669
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:14,319
Back off!

670
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:20,658
Come on, take these pills.

671
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:26,047
Come on, swallow.

672
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:35,756
- Lovely hair, so red, so beautiful.
- Look what I have here.

673
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:38,384
A wind-up cat doll.

674
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:42,221
Listen to that, sweetheart.
Isn't that pretty?

675
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:43,347
Huh?

676
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,942
Sure you want this...

677
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:42,950
Hi, kid.

678
01:01:54,920 --> 01:02:00,096
You go ahead with your game.
I'll start in the bedroom.

679
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:10,310
My name's John.

680
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:15,441
They call you Charlie, don't they?

681
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:21,487
Hey...

682
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:22,988
You want to teach me
how to play that?

683
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:25,662
'Cause I'm terrible at games.
You can beat me all the time.

684
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:27,459
No.

685
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:35,334
Where's Charlie? What
are you doing with her?

686
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:37,253
I told you, Andy, she's
perfectly all right.

687
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:38,837
There's nothing to worry about.

688
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,673
Yeah, well, I want to
see her, goddamn it.

689
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:42,892
Just behave yourself.

690
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:46,855
Do as we ask, we'll see.

691
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,516
You bastards.

692
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:52,610
Are you gonna do the test or not?

693
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:57,031
Oh, sure. Well, sure.

694
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:00,527
Good deal.

695
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:06,161
It's a one-way glass. You won't
see us but we'll see you.

696
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:23,220
All right, send him in.

697
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:28,554
Hi, how are you?

698
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:31,353
Having the time of
my life. Sit down.

699
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,688
Did they tell you
anything about what

700
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:40,274
we're supposed to be doing in here?

701
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:44,120
All they told me was
to come talk to you.

702
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:49,700
You look nervous. Thirsty?
Want some water?

703
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:52,750
Yeah, I'm thirsty.

704
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:57,458
You know, they mentioned
something about a test.

705
01:03:57,459 --> 01:03:58,751
Uh-huh.

706
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:00,127
You want some water?

707
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:02,756
No, I'll pass.

708
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:31,576
Why don't you put some ink in it?

709
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:42,587
Put ink in it?

710
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:45,381
You gotta be crazy.

711
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,637
- Goddamn it.
- He's tipped over.

712
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:53,847
He's been on the run too long.

713
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:55,933
All those damn pills you've
been giving him haven't helped.

714
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:57,184
Just give me time.

715
01:04:57,185 --> 01:05:00,813
No, Rainbird's right. He's
lost it and time won't help.

716
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:04,576
Increase his medication. I'll
decide what to do with him later.

717
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:09,355
- Work on the girl.
- Oh, I am.

718
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:14,118
With a little luck, before long,
she'll trust me like a brother.

719
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:50,496
Hi, kid, how you doing?

720
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:56,168
Why do you come every
day? I'm not messy.

721
01:05:56,703 --> 01:06:00,173
It's just my job, kid.

722
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:06,879
Because they're all
full of shit. Why else?

723
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:12,926
I want to see my father.

724
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:15,521
Sure you do.

725
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:20,350
I wish I could help. I don't
even know where the man is.

726
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:23,730
This is a big place, Charlie.

727
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:30,527
They say they'll let me see
him if I... if I do something.

728
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:32,112
And I don't want to.

729
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:33,739
Well...

730
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:36,074
Can it be that bad, what
they want you to do?

731
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:39,249
I mean, if just by doing it, you
can get to see your old man.

732
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:42,335
It is.

733
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:51,089
Storm's coming on. Sure hope those
lights don't go off altogether.

734
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:53,888
No, sir, I wouldn't like that.

735
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:06,438
Hey...

736
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:08,273
Listen.

737
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:10,234
Are you scared by my face?

738
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:13,659
I mean, I could wear
a mask or something.

739
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:15,573
I've seen worse.

740
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:01,668
Kid! Kid, please!

741
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:05,332
I can't stand the dark.
Please, kid.

742
01:08:05,898 --> 01:08:07,399
Kid!

743
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:10,085
I gotta get outta here.
You gotta help me.

744
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,545
Use your card.

745
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:15,674
All the electricity's gone. The card's
no good. Hey, let me outta here.

746
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,178
Hey! Let me out!

747
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:23,724
- What's the matter?
- Let us out. Hey! There's people in here.

748
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:26,853
Stop it, we're okay.

749
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,734
I mean, aren't we?

750
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:33,900
Yeah, I guess you're right.

751
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:39,498
It's just... The dark.
I can't stand it.

752
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:44,244
It's just like the place they
put me when I was captured.

753
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:46,622
Who put you?

754
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:48,915
The Cong.

755
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:50,709
Who's the Cong?

756
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:52,586
You mean to tell me...

757
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:56,256
Oh, no, of course not,
you're too young.

758
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:59,092
It was the war, see. Vietnam.

759
01:08:59,093 --> 01:09:04,723
The Cong were the bad guys.
They wore black pajamas.

760
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:08,226
In the jungle we were on patrol.
Walked into an ambush.

761
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:10,354
Only about six of us got out.

762
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:13,106
We ran.

763
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:16,234
Went the wrong way.

764
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:18,612
They caught me.

765
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:22,032
Threw me in a hole in the ground.

766
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:26,203
Like being buried alive.
It was always dark like this.

767
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:28,081
What did you eat?

768
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:32,043
They threw down rotted rice.

769
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:34,920
Sometimes I'd eat spiders.

770
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:37,707
Live ones. Great, big spiders. I'd
chase them around in the dark

771
01:09:37,733 --> 01:09:40,926
- ...and kill them and eat them.
- Gross.

772
01:09:40,927 --> 01:09:43,553
They turned me into an animal.

773
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:47,265
You got it a little easier than me, kid,
but it all comes down to the same thing.

774
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:50,235
Like a rat in a trap.

775
01:09:50,645 --> 01:09:54,981
You think maybe they'll get the
lights back on pretty soon?

776
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:58,531
Doesn't matter. We're together.

777
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:05,450
God, kid. If some day I could help
you the way you're helping me...

778
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:10,747
You could. You could get
a message to my father.

779
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:13,208
You know, what's it
all about, Charlie?

780
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:15,627
Why do they have you
and your daddy here?

781
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:17,630
What is it they want you to do?

782
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:26,471
They won't make me
take any more pills.

783
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:29,976
No more pills, you bastard.

784
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:35,856
How are you gonna help Charlie
if you're a goddamn zombie?

785
01:10:35,857 --> 01:10:39,776
Listen, maybe I could
get in to see your dad.

786
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:42,028
You could? You really
think you could?

787
01:10:42,029 --> 01:10:44,281
I could change with Herbie, one of
the orderlies in the other wing.

788
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:45,991
I could see your dad,
tell him you're okay...

789
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:49,035
Well, maybe not tell him, but
pass him a note or something.

790
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:51,455
Oh, thank you, thank you.

791
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:53,665
Shit.

792
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:56,134
Maybe you oughta light the
damn fires if you can.

793
01:10:56,836 --> 01:11:01,339
I told you, it's like letting
a wild animal out of a cage.

794
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:05,844
I promised myself I'd
never do it again.

795
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:11,683
That man at the airport, those men at the
farm, I killed them, I burned them up.

796
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:14,437
Yeah, but the way you told it,
it sounded like self-defense.

797
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:18,023
Yes, but that's no excuse.

798
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:21,693
Also sounded like you
saved your dad's life.

799
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:24,988
Look, if you do what
they want you to do,

800
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:27,282
but only as much as you want to do,

801
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:29,034
it might just be the way for
you to get out of here.

802
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:32,245
I'll help anyway I can.

803
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:35,207
Oh, my! Light.

804
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:37,756
Hold on there.

805
01:11:39,504 --> 01:11:43,850
I'm sorry you got stuck
with me in here, John.

806
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:48,094
But I'm awful glad too.

807
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:52,766
Yeah, well, you look like you could use
a little rest, huh? Come on, let's try.

808
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:56,061
Attagirl.

809
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:58,610
There we go.

810
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:08,787
That's the girl.

811
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:18,919
Now, you just relax and
you'll be asleep in no time.

812
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:25,554
And you'll have
sweet, sweet dreams.

813
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:30,096
That's the girl.

814
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,478
Good night, kid.

815
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:40,526
Good night.

816
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,358
Daddy.

817
01:12:56,664 --> 01:13:00,667
Now, Charlie, you know what
you're supposed to do.

818
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:02,419
I want you to go in the other room.

819
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:05,719
I don't want to have to
look at you while I do this.

820
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:08,141
Something might happen.

821
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:35,201
Look at those alphas,
she's really jacked up.

822
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:39,332
Everything all set? Tape rolling?

823
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,959
Everything all right with her?

824
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,882
Yes.

825
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:47,256
You all set in there?

826
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:49,758
Ready in here.

827
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,845
Are we ready here? Tape rolling?

828
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:57,475
- Rolling.
- All right. Everyone stand by.

829
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:00,690
Go ahead, Charlene.

830
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:20,673
Wood chips. They should've
given me something harder.

831
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:32,559
Something's happening in there.

832
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:39,100
Temperature just jumped 10 degrees.

833
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:03,166
There it goes.

834
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:08,424
Her alpha patterns look
like the goddamn Andes.

835
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:25,104
She did it. By God, she did
it and we got it all on tape.

836
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:31,493
Back off. Just back off.

837
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:33,991
Back off.

838
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:35,572
Look at the tub.

839
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,830
Back off.

840
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,964
Did you see the water in that
tub boil? And the temperature?

841
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,132
Jesus, did we get the audio?

842
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:55,300
- We got it.
- We did?

843
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:59,304
Good deal. My God, did you see
what she did? Did you see that?

844
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:01,473
My God, is there anyone here

845
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:04,601
that has any doubt that she
didn't make that happen herself?

846
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:06,269
Not at all, Chief. None.

847
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:08,938
Holy Christ! I knew something was
gonna happen, but I had no idea.

848
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:10,982
That tray actually flew
and she controlled it.

849
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:12,942
Then she put her power in the tub.

850
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:16,029
And we got it! We got it all on tape, and
it's good enough to stand up in court.

851
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:18,323
Right up in the goddamn
Supreme Court.

852
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:20,492
What are you looking
so miserable about?

853
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:21,826
You got her to do it by promising

854
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:23,161
she could see her father again.

855
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:24,370
Well, so what?

856
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:26,456
She must never see him.

857
01:16:26,457 --> 01:16:28,834
We never intended to let her.

858
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:31,503
She'll never stop asking for it.

859
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:34,632
Suppose by some strange
accident they get together.

860
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:36,716
Suppose they do.

861
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:38,676
She does whatever he tells her.

862
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:44,024
Suppose he persuades
her to destroy us all.

863
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:48,186
No chance.

864
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:50,030
There's always a chance.

865
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:53,650
He's right. They can never
see each other again.

866
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:56,236
Then you better send
somebody along after her.

867
01:16:56,237 --> 01:16:57,529
Huh?

868
01:16:57,530 --> 01:17:00,740
Your technician must've had an
appointment he forgot about.

869
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:02,992
He just went out of here
in a hell of a rush.

870
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:07,964
He also left the door open, and
your firestarter just walked out.

871
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:11,668
Christ.

872
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:14,092
One of you men go and get her.

873
01:17:16,674 --> 01:17:18,391
Go on.

874
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:24,681
Sure.

875
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:29,062
Which of you would like to
go and get the little girl?

876
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:12,317
<i>Andy?</i>

877
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:17,655
Here you go, ol' buddy.

878
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:21,580
Oh, good.

879
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:39,005
Listen, Andy.

880
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:41,216
We've determined
that your power has

881
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:43,593
deteriorated somewhat
since you got here.

882
01:18:43,594 --> 01:18:47,348
In fact, we've had no
positive results at all.

883
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:52,602
What do you expect with all these
drugs you've been giving me?

884
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:55,438
You expect me to do my
best when I'm stoned?

885
01:18:55,439 --> 01:19:00,443
I did everything I could. I tried.
I did everything I could to...

886
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:02,487
Yes, of course I
know that you have,

887
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:04,489
and believe me,
I appreciate it very much.

888
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:06,866
In fact, I think you need a rest.

889
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:09,535
Now, did you know that
The Shop has a small

890
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:12,330
compound on the island
of Maui, in Hawaii?

891
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:16,334
How would it be if I sent you
there for the immediate future?

892
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:18,503
I'll still get my medication?

893
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:21,006
Oh, sure, all you need.

894
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:24,384
Well, that sounds nice.

895
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:26,808
All right, good deal.

896
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:30,974
Then I'll get things started
in that direction right away.

897
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:36,481
You just take it easy, kid.
We'll take care of everything.

898
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:25,069
She's so beautiful.
What's her name?

899
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:29,575
Actually, she's more of a boy.
His name is Necromancer.

900
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:32,285
What does "necromancer" mean?

901
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:34,954
I think it means something
like wizard or sorcerer.

902
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:37,628
Something like that.

903
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:44,756
They said if I did what they wanted,
they'd let me see my father.

904
01:20:44,757 --> 01:20:47,175
How did I know they were gonna
be so damn stubborn about it?

905
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:49,761
I guess you'll have to
do it for them again.

906
01:20:49,762 --> 01:20:51,846
But when will I ever stop?

907
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:53,890
Look, baby.

908
01:20:53,891 --> 01:20:57,270
It's like poker.

909
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:00,938
If you ain't dealing from
strength, you just ain't dealing.

910
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:03,649
Every time you light
one of their fires,

911
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:06,319
make sure that you get
something in return.

912
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,947
This is your old Uncle John
talking, you understand me?

913
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:11,449
Okay.

914
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:13,701
What about this... What do you
call it? This power of yours?

915
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:15,453
I know you were awful
scared about it before.

916
01:21:15,454 --> 01:21:17,955
How do you feel about it now?

917
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:22,085
It's different now.
It's a lot stronger.

918
01:21:22,086 --> 01:21:27,090
Yesterday, when I told
it to back off, it did.

919
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:30,802
It was like I let it out in a
single straight line and then...

920
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:33,304
- Then you pulled it back into yourself?
- Oh, no.

921
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:35,306
I put it into the water.

922
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:40,187
If I pulled it back into
myself, I guess I'd burn up.

923
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:43,523
When am I gonna get
to see my father?

924
01:21:43,524 --> 01:21:47,151
Well, Charlie, we'll just have
to give them enough rope.

925
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:50,446
Next time, there has
to be more water.

926
01:22:06,713 --> 01:22:08,381
Everything all set here?

927
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:12,051
Tape running? All right, stand by.

928
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:15,681
We're ready when you are, Charlene.

929
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:17,700
The temperature in the testing room
should be -15 degrees Fahrenheit.

930
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:19,744
Plus or minus five degrees.

931
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:22,122
It's 105 in there.

932
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:34,759
The blocks are starting to burn.

933
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,103
Cinder blocks.

934
01:24:26,853 --> 01:24:29,276
God.

935
01:24:34,695 --> 01:24:36,788
Back off. Just back off.

936
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:43,995
Back off. Just back off.

937
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:47,749
Back off.

938
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,783
I want to see my father.

939
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:24,418
You better tell her something.

940
01:25:26,246 --> 01:25:29,165
Soon, Charlie.

941
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:31,876
When you show us a little more.

942
01:25:31,877 --> 01:25:36,714
If you don't let me see him now,
I'll make something happen.

943
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:39,968
Do you hear me? I'll
make something happen.

944
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:53,064
<i>Time for lunch.</i>

945
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:55,283
<i>Well, instant banquet.</i>

946
01:25:56,443 --> 01:25:59,822
<i>Nice, table companion.</i>

947
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:19,924
I'm telling you, we're not
through with testing her.

948
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:23,636
You saw what she's capable of. She
hasn't even reached her potential.

949
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:26,013
Perhaps Herman would
like to see her

950
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:28,307
blow up a country
before he gives in.

951
01:26:28,308 --> 01:26:31,477
I'm scientifically rational enough
not to form a complete opinion

952
01:26:31,478 --> 01:26:34,980
based on two experiments.

953
01:26:34,981 --> 01:26:39,281
I'm satisfied, yes,
but only partially.

954
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:43,410
Have you made the arrangements
regarding her father?

955
01:26:43,782 --> 01:26:45,909
It's all taken care of.

956
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,298
Night, Doc.

957
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:07,263
Rainbird.

958
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:09,377
Have you considered
what might happen

959
01:27:09,403 --> 01:27:12,268
if that girl found out whose
side you're really on?

960
01:27:12,269 --> 01:27:14,812
Oh, yes, I have.

961
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:17,481
I'd say you stand a good
chance of finding out

962
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:20,906
what a steak feels like
in a microwave oven.

963
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:25,619
Would you shed a bitter tear?

964
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:29,535
No.

965
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:33,040
No point in lying
to you about that.

966
01:27:36,293 --> 01:27:38,794
When we find out all we
need to know from her...

967
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:40,342
When you give her to me.

968
01:27:51,141 --> 01:27:52,938
What are you gonna do with her?

969
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:58,355
John the friendly
orderly will come in.

970
01:27:58,356 --> 01:28:02,693
He will greet her, talk
to her, get her to smile.

971
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:07,665
John the friendly orderly will make her
happy 'cause he's the only one who can.

972
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:13,746
And when John feels that she has reached
the moment of her greatest happiness,

973
01:28:13,747 --> 01:28:19,710
he will strike her across the bridge
of the nose, breaking it explosively,

974
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:24,548
and sending bone
fragments into her brain.

975
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:30,054
It'll be quick and he'll be
looking at her face at the time.

976
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:33,525
He will know her power.

977
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:38,604
And when he dies,

978
01:28:38,605 --> 01:28:41,732
which I hope is very soon,

979
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:47,911
perhaps he can take that power
with him into the other world.

980
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:07,384
You are crazy.

981
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:14,932
Mmm.

982
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:18,269
So, Andy, I've made all the
arrangements for you to go to Hawaii.

983
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:21,021
Good. When am I going?

984
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:22,773
Today.

985
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:26,653
- Today?
- Well, 8:00 this evening.

986
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:28,646
How?

987
01:29:28,647 --> 01:29:31,657
First class comfort all the way.

988
01:29:31,658 --> 01:29:34,285
I mean, what's taking me?

989
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:37,288
You go from here by
helicopter to the base,

990
01:29:37,289 --> 01:29:41,635
then the rest of the way
by army transport plane.

991
01:29:42,168 --> 01:29:45,012
Hmm.

992
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:48,850
- 8:00?
- 8:00.

993
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:59,268
You know, that could bite you.

994
01:29:59,269 --> 01:30:01,061
What?

995
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:03,235
That snake you're holding.

996
01:30:10,196 --> 01:30:14,074
Christ, how did that get there?

997
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:18,000
I guess you just picked
it up from a bush.

998
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:21,373
I want you to contact
that helicopter pilot.

999
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:23,375
No.

1000
01:30:23,376 --> 01:30:25,173
- Hey, guard.
- Shut up.

1001
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:30,299
Contact the helicopter pilot and
tell him you'll be coming along.

1002
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,468
No, I won't be coming along.

1003
01:30:38,391 --> 01:30:41,189
Yes, of course I'm coming along.

1004
01:30:50,195 --> 01:30:51,904
My daughter will be with us.

1005
01:30:51,905 --> 01:30:53,697
Oh, no.

1006
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:56,575
She can't come. She's
far too dangerous.

1007
01:30:56,576 --> 01:31:01,547
Oh, yeah? Well, now, who do
you think made her dangerous?

1008
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:10,673
My daughter is coming along.

1009
01:31:10,674 --> 01:31:13,926
And I don't want you to contradict
me again, do you understand me?

1010
01:31:13,927 --> 01:31:16,555
Yes, of course.

1011
01:31:19,849 --> 01:31:22,727
You contact the helicopter.

1012
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:28,899
We'll let him take us as
far as the army plane.

1013
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:32,069
There has to be a refueling stop
between here and Hawaii, right?

1014
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:33,946
Yeah, we'll have to
refuel in California.

1015
01:31:33,947 --> 01:31:36,245
Yeah.

1016
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:38,742
Okay.

1017
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:42,247
- Now, do you have a paper and a pen?
- Sure.

1018
01:31:43,456 --> 01:31:46,084
Here you go.

1019
01:31:46,793 --> 01:31:49,128
I'm gonna write something
to my daughter.

1020
01:31:49,129 --> 01:31:51,046
You're gonna take it to her.

1021
01:31:51,047 --> 01:31:53,090
Yes, of course.

1022
01:31:53,091 --> 01:31:55,384
<i>Charlie, love.</i>

1023
01:31:55,385 --> 01:31:57,636
<i>First thing, when you
finish reading this,</i>

1024
01:31:57,637 --> 01:31:59,805
<i>flush it down the toilet, okay?</i>

1025
01:31:59,806 --> 01:32:03,267
<i>Second thing, if everything
goes the way I'm planning,</i>

1026
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:05,936
<i>we're gonna be out of here tonight.</i>

1027
01:32:05,937 --> 01:32:10,774
<i>Third thing, I want you to
be in the stables at 8:00.</i>

1028
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:13,110
<i>I'll arrange for
somebody to bring you.</i>

1029
01:32:13,111 --> 01:32:16,238
<i>I miss you, Charlie.
I love you so much.</i>

1030
01:32:19,117 --> 01:32:20,617
John!

1031
01:32:20,618 --> 01:32:22,461
Hi, baby.

1032
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,539
I have to talk to you.

1033
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,383
Yeah, what about?

1034
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:30,633
I'll tell you in the hall.

1035
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:33,964
They listen here.

1036
01:32:33,965 --> 01:32:35,591
Right.

1037
01:32:38,428 --> 01:32:41,513
My daddy's found a way
for us to get out of here.

1038
01:32:41,514 --> 01:32:45,267
I'm supposed to meet him at
the stables at 8:00 tonight.

1039
01:32:45,268 --> 01:32:47,227
That's great. How did he do it?

1040
01:32:47,228 --> 01:32:49,146
I don't know, but
isn't it wonderful?

1041
01:32:49,147 --> 01:32:51,482
It's better than that, baby.
It's a miracle. I'll take you.

1042
01:32:51,483 --> 01:32:56,454
No, you'd get in trouble. I wouldn't
do that to you. You're my friend.

1043
01:32:58,656 --> 01:33:02,576
I appreciate that, Charlie,
but I'd do anything for you.

1044
01:33:04,162 --> 01:33:05,663
Hi, Charlie.

1045
01:33:10,043 --> 01:33:11,627
My name's Mike.

1046
01:33:11,628 --> 01:33:13,337
And Captain Hollister
has assigned me

1047
01:33:13,338 --> 01:33:15,340
to take you to the stables tonight.

1048
01:33:15,381 --> 01:33:17,174
What time?

1049
01:33:17,175 --> 01:33:18,842
Well, let's see.

1050
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:22,554
I'll be back for you about
quarter to 8:00 this evening.

1051
01:33:22,555 --> 01:33:25,849
So, what's going on?

1052
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:28,435
I asked if I could go
riding at nighttime.

1053
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:29,686
Oh?

1054
01:33:29,687 --> 01:33:31,814
Sure, kid, anything you want.

1055
01:33:33,024 --> 01:33:34,274
Bye.

1056
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:35,901
See you later.

1057
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:56,983
Come to me, Charlie.

1058
01:35:06,326 --> 01:35:09,500
Okay, let's check you in here.

1059
01:35:15,293 --> 01:35:17,586
Hey!

1060
01:35:17,587 --> 01:35:19,922
Anybody here?

1061
01:35:19,923 --> 01:35:21,423
You can go now.

1062
01:35:21,424 --> 01:35:23,301
I got the kid with me.

1063
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:26,972
I said you can go now!

1064
01:35:29,307 --> 01:35:32,142
Get out of here.

1065
01:35:32,143 --> 01:35:35,317
Can't do it, Charlie.

1066
01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:41,948
Back off. Back off.

1067
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:49,494
Get out of here, you bastard,
or I'll burn you up, I'll fry you.

1068
01:35:56,668 --> 01:35:58,835
Charlie.

1069
01:35:58,836 --> 01:36:00,633
Charlie.

1070
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:03,840
John? John?

1071
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:05,467
Where are you?

1072
01:36:05,468 --> 01:36:07,470
I'm up here.

1073
01:36:09,222 --> 01:36:11,850
John...

1074
01:36:13,059 --> 01:36:18,855
I'm really glad you're here,
but if anybody found out...

1075
01:36:18,856 --> 01:36:20,691
That doesn't matter anymore.

1076
01:36:20,692 --> 01:36:23,568
The only thing that
matters is you and me.

1077
01:36:23,569 --> 01:36:26,071
How'd you get Charlie to
cooperate with the experiments?

1078
01:36:26,072 --> 01:36:27,698
Rainbird got her to do it.

1079
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:29,199
Who's Rainbird?

1080
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:31,702
He's an agent, an exterminator.

1081
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:34,204
Charlene thinks he's
an orderly named John.

1082
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:38,166
Come on up, Charlie. Come to John.

1083
01:36:38,167 --> 01:36:41,420
- My father should be here any minute now.
- I know.

1084
01:36:41,421 --> 01:36:45,266
Hurry. Climb up now. Come to John.

1085
01:36:46,759 --> 01:36:49,177
That's it. Come on.

1086
01:36:49,178 --> 01:36:51,179
Good.

1087
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:54,599
Good girl. Right...

1088
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:57,148
- Are you armed?
- Yes.

1089
01:36:57,770 --> 01:36:59,229
Charlie?

1090
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:01,073
Daddy!

1091
01:37:14,829 --> 01:37:18,299
Yeah. Oh.

1092
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:20,810
Let me look at you.

1093
01:37:20,836 --> 01:37:23,628
Is it true? Are we
really going away?

1094
01:37:23,629 --> 01:37:28,009
Yes, it's true, we're
really going away.

1095
01:37:29,302 --> 01:37:31,930
Baby.

1096
01:37:32,305 --> 01:37:36,560
- You pushed him.
- You're right.

1097
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:39,519
My friend John is here.

1098
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:42,273
The orderly?

1099
01:37:43,608 --> 01:37:46,276
Yeah, he's up there.

1100
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:50,782
Couldn't we take him with
us if he wants to come?

1101
01:37:52,408 --> 01:37:54,618
He's the one that shot us, baby.

1102
01:37:54,619 --> 01:37:56,745
He's the one that brought us here.

1103
01:37:56,746 --> 01:37:59,998
Oh, no, Daddy, that's John.
He took care of my room.

1104
01:37:59,999 --> 01:38:02,167
No.

1105
01:38:02,168 --> 01:38:04,796
He is with them.

1106
01:38:14,806 --> 01:38:16,181
It isn't true, is it?

1107
01:38:16,182 --> 01:38:17,934
Yes, it's true.

1108
01:38:18,601 --> 01:38:20,936
Where are you, you son of a bitch?

1109
01:38:20,937 --> 01:38:23,355
You tricked me, you lied to me.

1110
01:38:23,356 --> 01:38:26,817
No, I just mixed up the
truth a little, Charlie.

1111
01:38:26,818 --> 01:38:29,820
And I did it to save your life.

1112
01:38:29,821 --> 01:38:34,449
You come down here before I set
everything on fire, 'cause I can do it.

1113
01:38:34,450 --> 01:38:36,660
Oh, I know you can.

1114
01:38:36,661 --> 01:38:39,871
But if you do, you're gonna
burn up an awful lot of horses.

1115
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:45,503
Can't you hear them? Necromancer's
in one of those stalls.

1116
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:52,184
No, I'm not gonna do it.

1117
01:38:55,471 --> 01:38:58,850
No, I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna burn.

1118
01:39:00,059 --> 01:39:02,607
No! Back off.

1119
01:39:11,237 --> 01:39:13,239
Please, don't. Back off.

1120
01:39:19,203 --> 01:39:21,455
You're not gonna do it.

1121
01:39:22,248 --> 01:39:25,752
Don't. Back off. Back off!

1122
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:32,595
What more do you want from us?
Why can't you just let us go?

1123
01:39:32,758 --> 01:39:38,221
You can't just be let go. I don't think
your father even believes that now.

1124
01:39:38,222 --> 01:39:40,056
You're dangerous,
Charlie, and you know it.

1125
01:39:40,057 --> 01:39:41,850
That's not my fault.

1126
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:44,311
I know that. I don't care
about that. I never did.

1127
01:39:44,312 --> 01:39:46,563
All I care about is you.

1128
01:39:46,564 --> 01:39:49,738
Now, come up here! Don't
make me shoot your father.

1129
01:39:50,735 --> 01:39:52,736
Don't listen to him, Charlie.

1130
01:39:52,737 --> 01:39:57,115
- You promise he'll be all right?
- I give you my real word.

1131
01:39:57,116 --> 01:39:59,284
Don't do it, baby.

1132
01:39:59,285 --> 01:40:02,087
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1133
01:40:12,173 --> 01:40:13,674
Kill him.

1134
01:40:34,946 --> 01:40:36,572
Jump.

1135
01:40:37,448 --> 01:40:38,995
No.

1136
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:44,496
No!

1137
01:40:44,497 --> 01:40:47,457
Oh, Daddy! Are you hurt?

1138
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:49,000
Charlie...

1139
01:40:49,001 --> 01:40:50,752
Daddy! Daddy!

1140
01:40:50,753 --> 01:40:52,462
You're bleeding.

1141
01:40:52,463 --> 01:40:54,465
Charlie!

1142
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,347
Daddy!

1143
01:40:58,511 --> 01:41:00,558
- Look at me.
- Go on.

1144
01:41:04,976 --> 01:41:07,979
Charlie, look at me.

1145
01:41:09,605 --> 01:41:13,234
That's it. So I can see your eyes.

1146
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:18,905
I love you, Charlie.

1147
01:41:29,959 --> 01:41:31,460
I love you.

1148
01:41:38,009 --> 01:41:42,137
<i>I say again, Condition Bright
Yellow. This is not a drill.</i>

1149
01:41:42,138 --> 01:41:44,514
<i>Repeat, not a drill.</i>

1150
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:46,891
<i>Converge on stables. Use caution.</i>

1151
01:41:46,892 --> 01:41:49,645
<i>It's the girl and she's...</i>

1152
01:41:50,813 --> 01:41:54,566
You gotta get away
if you can, Charlie.

1153
01:41:54,567 --> 01:42:00,572
If you have to kill anybody that gets
in your way, I want you to do it.

1154
01:42:00,573 --> 01:42:05,201
You let them know that
this is a war, Charlie.

1155
01:42:05,202 --> 01:42:08,580
You have to get out of here.

1156
01:42:08,581 --> 01:42:11,834
Do it for me.

1157
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:17,756
Do it for me, baby,
do you understand?

1158
01:42:17,757 --> 01:42:24,355
You make it. You make it so they can't
ever do anything like this again.

1159
01:42:27,058 --> 01:42:30,435
You'll have to burn
it all down, baby.

1160
01:42:30,436 --> 01:42:33,064
Burn it all down.

1161
01:42:34,398 --> 01:42:36,946
Daddy...

1162
01:42:40,946 --> 01:42:45,952
Go on. Get outta here
before it all goes up.

1163
01:42:52,708 --> 01:42:55,711
I can't leave you.

1164
01:42:56,253 --> 01:42:58,926
I can't leave you, Daddy.

1165
01:43:01,926 --> 01:43:04,520
Oh...

1166
01:43:04,887 --> 01:43:07,435
I love you, Charlie...

1167
01:43:10,935 --> 01:43:13,904
Oh, no, Daddy.

1168
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:31,581
Get the door. Ready?

1169
01:43:36,794 --> 01:43:39,137
- Don't move.
- Freeze.

1170
01:44:12,163 --> 01:44:14,873
Oh, my God!

1171
01:44:14,874 --> 01:44:18,674
Get her! Get her!

1172
01:44:40,065 --> 01:44:42,693
- Run! Run for it!
- Let's go!

1173
01:45:14,183 --> 01:45:18,108
Come on, let's get out of here.

1174
01:46:08,612 --> 01:46:11,160
No! No!

1175
01:46:30,009 --> 01:46:31,852
Take cover!

1176
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:37,103
Take cover!

1177
01:47:25,856 --> 01:47:29,030
No... Stop!

1178
01:47:30,027 --> 01:47:35,408
No! No!

1179
01:47:45,751 --> 01:47:48,094
<i>Attention!</i>

1180
01:47:48,754 --> 01:47:51,677
<i>Stay right where you are.</i>

1181
01:47:59,390 --> 01:48:03,269
<i>Do not move. We're coming down.</i>

1182
01:49:31,690 --> 01:49:34,818
For you, Daddy.

1183
01:49:50,667 --> 01:49:53,044
Irv, look who's here.

1184
01:49:53,045 --> 01:49:55,843
Thanks for the ride.

1185
01:50:43,345 --> 01:50:45,847
You'll be safe now, Charlie.

1186
01:50:46,849 --> 01:50:49,058
I'm doing it, Daddy.

1187
01:50:49,059 --> 01:50:51,687
I love you.

1187
01:50:52,305 --> 01:51:52,281

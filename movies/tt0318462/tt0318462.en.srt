{4580}{4660}Mouths full of wine, nice music
{4667}{4694}That beer is good, ah?
{4706}{4801}- Fuser, on January 4th, you should be done with all your exams, right?|- Yes
{4820}{4966}- If you want, i can make a detour to Miramar to visit your little girlfriend|- "little girlfriend"
{4976}{5018}A couple of days
{5075}{5170}- Look Fuser, look at that guy over there|- What?
{5184}{5228}Do you want your life to be like that?
{5269}{5322}You don't want your life to be like that, Fuser
{5348}{5404}What you want is to fuck in every country in South America
{5408}{5521}Hey boy...and in every town if we are lucky enough|That's and extra ingredient, right
{5526}{5658}{Y:i}What we had in common: our restlessness, our dreaming spirit
{5690}{5746}{Y:i}and the untiring love for the route
{5746}{5792}BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA|January 4th, 1952|Km 0
{5808}{5876}Let's go Ernestito, we don't have the whole day
{5890}{6001}- Isn't it too much Granado?|- Not enough chief.  Norton 500, "this" is a motorcycle
{6006}{6079}Your son is in good wheels, don't worry
{6208}{6274}You should expect some difficult times son
{6288}{6366}But the truth is that i always dreamed of doing something like this
{6373}{6495}And i have to confess that if i had a couple less years on me...|I would jump right along with you on that motorcycle
{6500}{6543}Try to think that i do it for the both of us
{6544}{6630}- 10 years planning this trip, uncle|- Since you were a kid
{6631}{6729}Meanwhile...I trust you eh?
{6774}{6812}And the revolution uncle, for when?
{6812}{6874}Here? In a century
{6941}{7005}- Are you already leaving?|- Yes, I’m off
{7061}{7172}You should only worry about taking your medicines, nothing more, ok?
{7202}{7223}And writing me...
{7231}{7312}The most beautiful letters you have ever read mom
{7317}{7376}- Bye, my love|- You'll see. Bye. I love you

{7877}{7907}Send me postcards
{7907}{7977}Ok, stop it or I’ll start crying. Please
{7980}{8016}Take care, ok?
{8037}{8129}Just like Don Quixote had Rocinante and Saint Martin had his mule
{8135}{8176}We have "La Poderosa"
{8176}{8301}- Yeah, that pisses oil|- Yes, pisses oil, but what I’m trying to say is that|in this precise moment
{8303}{8435}The young Fuser and myself are embarking in a trip|to the most remote places of the human spirit
{8441}{8536}where we will meet new lands, listen to new anthems, eat new fruits...
{8538}{8682}Granado...I’m making you responsible. If something happens to Ernesto I’ll find you.|Put on the handkerchief darling
{8700}{8773}Don't worry mam, he will come back to become|the doctor we all want him to be
{8774}{8807}It better be
{8815}{8860}Ok, is time to leave!
{9350}{9387}Animal!
{9534}{9577}Careful with that bike!
{9920}{9997}{Y:i}Dear mom...Buenos Aires is behind us
{10018}{10054}{Y:i}behind is as also the miserable life
{10062}{10128}{Y:i}the faculty, the exams and the dissertations that make you sleepy
{10167}{10222}{Y:i}Before us lies all of Latin America
{10259}{10303}{Y:i}From now on we will only trust in "La Poderosa"
{10857}{10992}{Y:i}I wish you could see us. We look like adventurers|and inspire admiration and envy everywhere
{11327}{11405}Go Mial. Assume aerodynamic road position
{11427}{11501}C'mon baby, don't fail me baby.|C'mon, c'mon
{11536}{11582}What happened Mial?!
{11778}{11911}{Y:i}I'm glad to have left behind civilization, and be closer to the earth
{11954}{12042}Wait, something is coming out...something is coming out
{12177}{12221}Fuser, are you alright?
{12309}{12350}What happened puppy?
{12507}{12527}Are you alright?
{12563}{12635}- What the fuck is that?|- What the fuck does it look like?
{12643}{12711}- A fucking dog?!|-  Oh fuck, you are a shitty driver...
{12720}{12778}What the fuck is that dog doing on the bike?
{12785}{12834}Is for Chichina and his name is Kamba
{12920}{12950}Pick up the bike.
{13228}{13344}Miramar, Argentina|January 13th, 1952|Km 601

{13608}{13668}- Good morning|- Good morning
{13677}{13736}- Chichina?|- She's inside with the rest of the family
{13786}{13816}That bike is giving you problems, uh?
{13909}{13964}Esteban, please tell us about your trip
{13976}{14079}It was great Don Horacio,|i had the opportunity to take a seminar in Cambridge
{14110}{14186}and stay a couple of weeks in London,|a fascinating city
{14188}{14261}- What a privilege!|- Yes it was
{14274}{14340}-  Esteban is getting his PhD soon, right?|- Yes
{14375}{14430}- Medicine?|- No, Law
{14454}{14483}Ah, law

{16020}{16052}Is your turn, come
{16066}{16114}I never saw a pig who wanted to dance, never.
{16168}{16192}C'mon
{16210}{16234}Knock it off!
{16291}{16465}- With this hand...back...side|- What are you laughing at?|- I'm laughing at you.
{16650}{16694}Tonight?
{16704}{16772}My dad ask aunt Roxanna not to take her eyes off of me
{16781}{16903}My mom promised the Lady of the Valley that she would|walk to her sanctuary if we broke up
{16939}{17081}And your parents can't see that the more they bury the diamonds,|the more decided is the pirate to steal them?
{17114}{17210}Believe me, this diamond wouldn't mind being stolen
{17299}{17332}Dance
{17510}{17535}Look
{17831}{17868}Let me see your bathroom
{17991}{18039}- Good night|- Good night ladies
{18226}{18338}Aunt Roxanna, which room is mine?

{19768}{19884}- How many days did you say we were staying here?|- You already know|- Two
{19903}{20040}- And how many days have we been here?|- If you become a Doctor, will you operate with wire too?|- Six days, Fuser
{20149}{20184}Someone will see us
{20644}{20734}If you'd stay we could do many things, Ernesto,|but only if you'd stay
{20831}{20865}I didn't like the sound of that
{20877}{21014}- What do you want me to say? That I’m going to wait for you?|- I told you I’m coming back
{21053}{21136}- Yes, i have the dog as proof|- You didn't like it?
{21198}{21399}What do you want Ernesto, what do you want to hear?|That I’m going to wait forever,|that I’ll wait for months and months till you come back?
{21527}{21663}- What's going on?|- What do you want? What do you want?
{21729}{21807}I'd like you to stay like this forever. Quiet.
{21883}{21967}I want to look at you, cause I’m not going|to see you for a long time
{22186}{22295}Of course I’m going to wait for you,|but please don't take an eternity
{22406}{22519}- And how long is an eternity?|- That's slippery ground mister
{22681}{22723}I'm not going to touch you
{22857}{23070}Did i hit you? Did i hurt you? Did i hurt you?|That was a trick, a very bad trick
{23083}{23189}Ok lovebirds...is time to leave.|Fuser
{23261}{23374}Miss Ferreira...|Thanks for everything
{23865}{24001}{Y:i}"I used to listen the bare feet splashing in the ship|"And had a feeling of the faces darkened by hunger
{24030}{24093}{Y:i}"My heart was a pendulum between her and the street
{24126}{24234}{Y:i}"I don't know with what strength i freed myself from her eyes,|"I broke away from her arms
{24243}{24326}{Y:i}"She was left clouding with tears her anguish|"Behind the rain and the glass
{24346}{24386}- Lorca eh?|- No
{24396}{24445}- Neruda|- No
{24450}{24542}- Who?|- I don't remember
{25215}{25271}- Good bye|- Bye
{25382}{25428}Wait, wait. The snot is...
{25482}{25555}And so...with Chichina, nothing...
{25611}{25705}Not even after giving her the German shepherd with pedigree...nothing
{25739}{25803}I mean, at least you saw a tit...one
{25895}{25969}Ahhh....You saw her tits, Ernesto
{25990}{26078}Scalpel, Scalpel
{26123}{26166}North American Dollars?
{26188}{26261}- Fifteen|- Chichina?|- Yes
{26261}{26376}I like that girl for you, i always said that she was your girlfriend.|We will eat better now
{26376}{26423}- No...|- Protein food
{26420}{26544}No, she gave me this money for when we get to the US.|She asked me to buy her some pants.
{26595}{26637}I told her i would
{26660}{26742}- What?|- Forget about this money. It is out of our budget.
{26757}{26875}- Fucking moron, he is testing me...|-  Che are you talking to the bike again
{26881}{26973}Listen to me man, what is wrong with your head?|That chick's got you by the balls.
{26992}{27056}Calm down
{27076}{27116}- Good evening|- Hi
{27382}{27514}Piedra de ֱguila, Argentina|January 29th, 1952|Km 1809
{27574}{27678}- How do you feel the bike?|- The wire is making wonders, it works great
{27868}{27918}- Son of a bitch...fuck
{27962}{27997}Are you alright Fuser?
{28053}{28085}It was the curve
{28138}{28160}Son of a...
{28263}{28323}Look at the pipe...|son of a bitch!
{28336}{28409}Pass the stakes, I’m all out
{28402}{28441}Wait, wait, don't fuck with me
{28463}{28530}- You had to choose this place, you idiot...|- No you chose this place
{28532}{28586}Hold that side
{28806}{28848}- No...fuck|- Son of a...
{28903}{28965}- The river is taking it|- Grab it, grab it
{29016}{29053}It took it
{29322}{29479}- Che and what if we go there?|- We should ask for help over here, with the common people
{29607}{29723}- Which one are we doing? The broken headlight?|- No, Red October. You have the experience right?
{29848}{29878}Good Night
{29920}{29946}What do you want
{29953}{30120}Maybe our appearance doesn't show it, but we are doctors|from Buenos Aires and Cףrdoba, respectively
{30134}{30447}We are traveling all over the country, doing some research|with hopes of curing some of the worst diseases of the 20th century
{30453}{30590}Plagues that not only consume our energy but that also|keeps Argentina in need
{30598}{30699}When by just reading the medical literature, you could notice, just as us...
{30705}{30797}What the fuck do you want, pair of bums?
{30840}{30980}Look sir, the wind took our tent, we are starving|and we need a place to spend the night
{30996}{31152}Ok, out there in the shed there's a good ground.|You can sleep with the workers
{31158}{31399}- We are doctors...|- Hmm...i like your face a lot, but i don't like yours fatty
{31454}{31508}- Fine?|- Yes, its fine|- Thank you.
{31859}{32047}{Y:i}Dear Mom...we are still hitting the road,|but to tell you the truth, the bike is less powerful every day
{32179}{32280}San Martםn de los Andes, Argentina|January 31st, 1952|Km 2051
{32323}{32478}{Y:i}Money and food are scarce, but we manage to find opportunities|to eat and sleep for free
{32544}{32629}{Y:i}Thanks to our secret weapon:|Alberto's infallible sweet talking
{32630}{32737}...plagues that not only consume our energy but compromise|the modernization of Argentina
{32740}{32982}- So, you are doctors|- Well, no. Alberto is a biochemist and I am an MD student|- He is practically graduated, we are like doctors
{32982}{33133}- Then i would appreciate it if you could look at a swelling i have in the neck|- Gladly, eh...Mr.?
{33133}{33157}Von Puttkamer
{33289}{33315}Does it hurt?
{33413}{33483}- This is a tumor|- What do you mean a tumor?|- Yes
{33529}{33612}- Do you think so|- Yes|- Allow me
{33679}{33782}I don't know Fuser, fat sedimentation|it could be a cyst
{33790}{33938}No.  It is a tumor in the occipital area
{33953}{34045}- Schatzie, these gentlemen say i have a tumor|- Tumor?
{34054}{34180}Good morning mam, i sincerely don't believe it is a tumor|but a sebaceous cyst
{34184}{34262}If you could give us a place where we could|eat and sleep we might be able to treat it
{34263}{34417}No, no look...we can't treat it. You will have to go|to Buenos Aires. I can recommend you a specialist
{34426}{34565}- Or we could try to help him, don't you think?|- Help with what? With the grass, with prayers?
{34568}{34709}- I understand, you can't do anything for me|- Yes we can, if you give us a place where we could eat and sleep.
{34727}{34955}- Around here there's a lake with lots of fish and a shed|- Sir, the diagnostic is very...|- We have nothing more to talk about, doctors. Let's go Schatzie
{35063}{35221}- The next time could you try to help us a little|- Of course i can give you a hand, but never at the price of the health of a man
{35228}{35354}- Ok, let's say that you are right and the old guy has a tumor,|how the fuck do you tell him like that?
{35361}{35430}Is the truth, if he can't handle it he can go to hell
{35430}{35568}- You can't treat a patient like that, you can't|- The guy has a serious problem,|the sooner he looks into it the better
{35585}{35670}That's the proper treatment, didn't they teach you that|at biochemistry school?
{35740}{35804}Don't talk to me about proper medicine
{35827}{35931}Nurse. First graduate and then talk.|You think you know everything, moron
{35948}{35988}I'm going to look for food
{36006}{36078}Duck! duck! duck!. Give me gun, move it! move it!
{36116}{36152}Son of a...
{36281}{36310}Great Mial...
{36316}{36340}I hit it, man
{36379}{36431}- How did you do it?|- I can't fucking believe it...
{36450}{36614}Well, there's no other choice but to get in the water|and pick up dinner, no?  Fuser, to the water to get the food!
{36616}{36689}You are really crazy if you think I’m going to get in there.|Do you know how cold is that water?
{36689}{36903}Yes, i know you are allergic to cold, water, hot and all that|but you know what, i am older, wiser and i shot the duck, so|you have to go
{36906}{36998}- That shot came out of your ass, besides i have asthma|- Ok, you are right. If you can't I’ll do it
{37041}{37119}- I didn't say i couldn't|- You can't or you don't want to|- I didn't say that i couldn't
{37134}{37228}Or you don't want to and that is the same. Or you could give|me Chichina's fifteen bucks...
{37254}{37309}...and we eat as God intended, c'mon.
{37318}{37410}- Look if i get to find that fucking duck, I’ll eat it all by myself|- Ah! in the water, in the water, duck.
{37475}{37570}- I'm going to get my balls frozen|- For the use you give them, Fuser...
{37681}{37866}Good Fuser, good...bring on that duck with potatoes.|Is it cold Fuser? Hey! cold? Not over here.
{37947}{37969}Duck
{38070}{38176}- Are you feeling sick?|- No, I’m just perfect
{38240}{38345}Bariloche Train Station, Argentina|3 days later|Km 2270
{38509}{38579}Easy
{38588}{38631}Fuser...
{39125}{39273}Fuser, listen to me. Give me Chichina's fifteen dollars and let's|go to a hospital like the people
{39309}{39384}If you say that to me again, I’ll throw up all over you.
{40477}{40673}{Y:i}Dear mom...what is it that's lost when you cross a border.|Each moment seems to be split in two
{40679}{40853}{Y:i}Melancholy for what was left behind and on the|other hand all the enthusiasm at entering new lands
{40871}{40932}Frias Lake, Argentina|February 15th, 1952|Km 2306
{40940}{41088}- Look Mial, Chile|- Chile! Viva Chile!
{41143}{41240}- Is it your first time out of the country?|- Yes, of course
{41243}{41288}You are almost a man, Che
{41342}{41520}Look Mial, when we are old and tired of traveling, we|should come back and set a clinic on this lake
{41581}{41623}That's a good idea
{41631}{41698}Providing attention to everybody, if anyone ever comes
{41704}{41756}Count on me, brother
{41773}{41840}Hey, things are getting better Fuser, eh?|- Yeah
{41877}{41972}- Hey, it is snowing|- No, is just frost
{42511}{42683}- Help me|- On three, 1, 2, 3|- Done
{42907}{42956}Go, go, go
{43095}{43213}- Fuck is cold!|- Some summer, uh
{43644}{43729}Che, you told me we would enter Chile like two conquerors.|Not on foot like a pair of losers
{43730}{43782}If you don't like it, go fuck yourself Ernesto
{43784}{43808}TEMUCO, CHILE|February 18th, 1952|Km 2772
{43810}{43858}What if we dump this shit that gives us so much trouble
{43876}{43935}And go on foot through the whole continent, you genius
{43950}{44084}Yes, we would see more and meet more people...|you would lose weight
{44104}{44178}You sissy, but if with a couple of dollars from|Chichina this gets fixed immediately
{44185}{44240}And again with the same thing. Forget about that money
{44286}{44405}Ok, perfect. If you get that mad then go all the way to Venezuela|walking and leave me here alone with the boss's money
{44417}{44510}Know what? I would get there in half the time and stop|meddling with other people business
{44514}{44535}Fuck you bastard!
{44643}{44730}"Uy, Ernestito, bring me the little Yankee pants|from Miami"
{44757}{44857}Can't you see that you will never see them on or off?|You wanker!
{44930}{44953}Fuser..
{45060}{45094}You know what your problem is?
{45111}{45180}Your fucking honesty.
{45183}{45254}You should tell a lie from now and then to help us.
{45356}{45448}- Hold it for a second
{45454}{45582}- Hey, hey, what are you doing?|- Come, Come

{68389}{68480}{Y:i}That up to a month ago she had been serving|tables, panting like me
{68495}{68537}{Y:i}Trying to live with dignity
{68585}{68685}{Y:i}In those dying eyes, there was a humble|request for excuses
{68700}{68818}{Y:i}And a desperate plea of consolation|that gets lost in the emptiness
{68833}{68983}{Y:i}Just as her body will get lost very soon|in the magnitude of the mystery that surrounds us
{69149}{69274}Fuser, you still haven't asked me how was the|field test with the Chilean sisters
{69298}{69393}You know how i fear that you might become|the new sexual ambassador of Argentina

{69520}{69573}Her name is "La Poderosa"

{78440}{78517}We didn't have much, just a dry and difficult land
{78539}{78586}It belonged to his grandparents
{78599}{78707}It was ours, until a landlord arrived and kicked us out
{78718}{78899}- And that is what they call progress|- We had to leave our son with the family and travel to find job
{78910}{79040}- Trying to escape from the police that wanted to catch us|- Why?
{79072}{79124}Because we are communists
{79147}{79230}We are going to the mine. If we are lucky I’ll find a job.
{79265}{79342}Apparently they are so dangerous that they|don't care what party you belong to
{79418}{79469}Are you looking for a job?
{79483}{79528}No, we are not.
{79564}{79689}No? And then why are you traveling?
{79778}{79829}Just because
{80008}{80166}Bless you, blessed be your travels

{80327}{80338}Thanks
{80424}{80465}- Some "mate"|- Thanks
{80528}{80594}{Y:i}Those eyes had a dark and tragic expression
{80650}{80751}{Y:i}They told us about some friends that had disappeared|under mysterious circumstances
{80758}{80834}{Y:i}And that apparently ended up in some|part on the bottom of the ocean
{80936}{81005}{Y:i}That was one of the coldest nights of my life
{81042}{81244}{Y:i}But meeting them made me feel closer to human kind.|Strange, so strange to me
{81482}{81607}You...you too|You, the next one
{81873}{81935}Move it, guys, move it
{81977}{82060}Chuquicamata Mine, Chile|March 15th, 1952|Km 5122

{83316}{83367}You two, what are doing here?
{83394}{83416}Nothing, we are looking
{83425}{83493}Looking at what, this is not a tourist attraction. Out
{83511}{83600}Can't you see that these people are thirsty.|Give them some water damn it.
{83656}{83694}I will call security so they will arrest you
{83702}{83732}Oh yeah. Why?
{83737}{83833}Invasion of property. This is the property of the|Anaconda Mining Company
{83890}{83914}Let's go.
{84032}{84048}Son of a bitch
{84689}{84776}{Y:i}When we left the mine, we felt reality was changing
{84783}{84814}{Y:i}...or were we the ones changing
{84881}{84981}{Y:i}Going deeper and deeper into the mountain range|we found more natives
{85012}{85086}{Y:i}that don't even have a roof in what used to be their own land
{85249}{85297}{Y:i}Finally we entered Peru
{85307}{85377}{Y:i}Thanks to a truck driver half blind, Felix
{85414}{85539}{Y:i}I almost forgot...Today is Alberto's 30th birthday|but not in Venezuela, as he had envisioned
{85603}{85701}{Y:i}We were so tired, mom|that we couldn't even celebrate
{85819}{85850}Fuser
{85933}{85979}This is humanly impossible
{86628}{86672}{Y:i}Finally we arrived to the heart of America...
{86689}{86720}{Y:i}Cuzco
{86735}{86817}Cuzco, Peru|April 2, 1952|Km 6932
{86832}{86886}{Y:i}After entering the city, we met Don Nestor
{86928}{87010}{Y:i}A very wise man, mom|that ended up as our official guide
{87031}{87094}I was wondering Sir, which one of this walls is Inca?
{87100}{87162}This one should be the Inca wall, and that one is Spanish
{87174}{87332}We, as a joke, call this one the Inca wall|and that one the wall of the Incapables, those were|the Spanish
{87366}{87619}Cuzco was the capital of the Incas, but|when the Spanish came they destroyed everything,|and named Lima as the new capital
{87631}{87660}- Lima?|- Yes
{87775}{87799}- This is The Plaza?|- Yes
{88123}{88421}She says that she has never been to a school because|she has always been near the cattle, that's why she doesn't|know how to speak Castilian only Quechua
{88428}{88718}I think that before, there was enough money for everything,|but now there's little money and there are no jobs
{88774}{88822}That is affecting us more and more
{88828}{89114}Since i was little i have worked with crafts|and that's how i keep on level...regular
{90087}{90125}With both hands, with both hands
{90208}{90254}With both hands, Nestor
{90576}{90602}Good evening
{90721}{90744}Good evening
{90841}{91019}When i was working, the owner came|and he threw me out of the land
{91046}{91118}Once i was producing all the products|he threw me out
{91133}{91188}He threw you out? How? Did he call the police?
{91193}{91302}Yes, he brought the police.|He is a powerful man, he has a lot of money
{91311}{91423}- He wanted me to leave the land|- Yes, once it was producing
{91432}{91605}Yes, it was producing wheat, corn, potatoes, beans...|and i was meant to keep a part of it
{91621}{91854}But i won't stay behind, i have to keep moving forward.|Working, looking for money to educate my children
{91862}{91911}- How many kids do you have?|- I have five kids
{91922}{92156}- Have you joined with other farmers of the area?|- Yes, in the community we are organized, we help each other

{93232}{93380}Machu Picchu, Peru|April 5th, 1952|Km 7014
{93891}{93980}Let's see how you behave Fuser, eh?|That's it, that's it
{94016}{94057}For posterity
{94173}{94312}{Y:i}The Incas had a high knowledge of astronomy, medicine,|math, among others
{94324}{94385}{Y:i}But the Spanish invaders had powder
{94425}{94510}{Y:i}How would America be today if things had been different?
{94540}{94709}Fuser, look what i think. I should marry with an Inca descendant|and found an indigenous party
{94743}{94780}We encourage everyone to vote
{94813}{94931}Reactivate Tupac Amaru's revolution,|the indoamerican revolution, Fuser|What do you think?
{94976}{95093}A revolution without gunshots?|You are crazy Mial
{95444}{95538}{Y:i}How is it possible that i feel nostalgia for a world i never knew
{95591}{95669}{Y:i}How do you explain that a civilization capable of building this
{95702}{95736}{Y:i}is wiped out to build...
{95763}{95805}{Y:i}...this
{95828}{95897}Lima, Peru|May 12th, 1952|Km 8198
{96305}{96348}- I know this is not the one|- No?
{96548}{96612}Mercaderes 52, let's ask
{96622}{96635}Mercaderes Street?
{96639}{96785}Mercaderes?  2 blocks that way, then turn right and 6 or 7 blocks more
{96793}{96895}- This one has to be Mercaderes|- That one too

{97665}{97718}{Y:i}Alberto had contacted him before starting the journey
{97737}{97856}{Y:i}He fed us, gave us cloth, money and some very good ideas
{97906}{98047}{Y:i}Mariategui talks about the revolutionary potential of the|natives and farmers of Latin America
{98069}{98142}{Y:i}He says that the native main problem is the land
{98156}{98289}{Y:i}and that the revolution will not be a copy|but a heroic creation of our people
{98476}{98570}"7 ESSAYS OF INTERPRETATION OF THE PERUVIAN REALITY"
{98909}{98966}{Y:i}"We are too few to be divided", he says

{102363}{102419}- And what do you think Ernesto?|- He is fascinated!
{102427}{102487}If he is fascinated, i would rather to hear it from him
{102505}{102652}Look Doctor, I feel that your book is a little beaten

{102796}{102888}- Well, that is not that bad|- No
{102904}{102994}Basically is poorly written and that makes it hard to read

{109831}{109889}- I'm going to tell you a secret|- Me?
{109930}{110126}The bufeo's genitals look like a woman's|and the natives use it to relieve themselves
{110133}{110358}But there's a little problem, when they are done|they have to kill the animal, because the suffer|contractions so strong that don't let them get out

{118122}{118188}Dr. Pesce has talked very enthusiastically about you|so, welcome to San Pablo
{118198}{118274}By the way, i have a letter from Dr. Pesce for you|do you want it now?
{118281}{118316}No, no, there'll be time for that
{118356}{118430}Well, since we are here i can show you something
{118443}{118506}The Amazon divides the colony in two
{118515}{118768}The south part is where we keep the patients.|Here, in the north part is were the staff, the doctors and nurses live.|And a couple of nuns that are very efficient
{118783}{118819}This is your room
{118906}{118984}The beds are a little hard, but that is good for your spine
{119099}{119141}You can see the hospital from here
{119153}{119237}Over there|And that's the laboratory
{119254}{119340}Doctor, let me introduce you to our Argentinean volunteers
{119430}{119486}Alberto, i understand you have|some experience in baciloscopy
{119492}{119572}- That's right|- I believe he could help us in the lab, why don't|you take him with you
{119619}{119667}Ernesto, you are going to help me in the hospital
{119760}{119837}Here we have the more serious cases,|we transfer them from the south area
{119871}{119917}- Georgina|- Hello doctor
{119939}{120046}- And do you make the operations on this side too?|- Yes, on that side we have an operating room
{120139}{120233}She is Silvia, daughter of one of our patients|and a very good nurse
{120337}{120399}- How is he?|- He's better, doctor
{120429}{120505}- Then keep administering the same treatment|- Yes
{120581}{120668}- Doctor, then how many patients live in the south area?|- Almost six hundred
{120671}{120840}- All of them Peruvian?|- No, most of them yes, but there are some from|Colombia, Venezuela and other countries of South America
{120975}{121122}I suggest you use these gloves. It's true that|leprosy under treatment is not contagious
{121125}{121198}but the nuns are very strict about this
{121283}{121428}- If it's not contagious, then this is purely symbolic|- Yes, but I’m telling you so you don't make mortal enemies over there
{121443}{121552}- Well, you'll have to forgive us but we are not going to use them|- Yes, thanks doctor
{121593}{121636}Don't say i didn't warn you
{121819}{121857}Take out the boxes.|Come this way
{122039}{122075}- Good evening|- Good evening
{122104}{122210}- Good evening.  Welcome to San Pablo|- Thanks|- You are very kind
{122219}{122287}- Papa Carlito, at your service|- Nemesio Reyna
{122293}{122354}- Ernesto Guevara|- I'm Alberto Granado, a pleasure to meet you
{122371}{122402}Nice to meet you
{122464}{122532}Doctor, didn't you explain the rules to them?
{122665}{122695}Nice to meet you
{122710}{122826}- Don Nemesio, nice to meet you

{123033}{123075}They are real gentlemen
{123080}{123158}Dr.  Bresciani, this gentlemen arrive and think|they can behave as they want?
{123170}{123269}Mother San Alberto, this gentlemen have good|medical experience in Cordoba and Buenos Aires
{123293}{123362}That doesn't give them the right to behave|like this and break the rules
{123371}{123420}I suggest we leave this conversation for later, ok?
{123455}{123492}Thanks Mother, you are very understanding
{123516}{123550}She is the Mother Superior
{123844}{123884}This is the dinning hall.
{123892}{124007}The nuns make lunch on Sundays,|but only for those that come to mass
{124076}{124229}The sad thing is that most of San Pablo's patients are here|because they have been abandoned by their families|or thrown out of their jobs
{124232}{124358}That's why they try to adapt to their new life|building their own houses, seeding, caring for animals
{124376}{124420}- Doctor, good morning|- How is Silvia?
{124442}{124530}- She doesn't want to go to surgery|- Thanks doctor, I’ll go see her
{124570}{124714}Silvia is a patient a little rebellious and if we don't|operate her ulna, she risks loosing her arm
{124788}{124817}Hello Silvia
{124911}{124950}She's very young
{125025}{125069}Can i come inside to talk to her
{125098}{125114}Yes
{125569}{125605}Can i sit?
{125801}{125847}Does your arm hurt?
{126133}{126172}What is wrong with you?
{126199}{126260}I was born with bad lungs
{126329}{126365}What a shame
{126383}{126520}No, is not that bad. Thanks to that|i skipped the military service
{126545}{126612}I didn't have to shine anyone boots
{126647}{126786}Is that why you became a doctor?|Because you are sick?
{126807}{126969}Is possible.|The first word i learned was injection
{127038}{127086}I want to be useful in some way
{127169}{127256}- You are wasting your time|- Why?
{127372}{127429}This life is hell
{127456}{127717}Yes, it's really fucked up, but we have to|fight for every breath and tell Death to fuck off
{128808}{129038}Hey Fuser,  Bresciani is going to write me a recommendation|for an internship in Cabo Blanco's Hospital, in Caracas|What do you think?
{129089}{129113}That's nice.
{129145}{129241}Nice?|What's going on Fuser?
{129348}{129416}- Did you see the river?|- Yes
{129496}{129564}It keeps away the sick from the healthy

{131226}{131318}It's ok, it's ok. Look at me
{131382}{131515}That's it. The nerve is coming out
{131525}{131567}It's thick
{131650}{131815}I have four siblings, Celia, Ana Maria|Roberto and Juan Martin
{131864}{132023}And they are the ones i miss the most actually.|And also my mom

{142388}{142460}- Should i ask her?|- The bird in the stories flies and never returns
{142464}{142491}Fly, fly
{142508}{142549}Do you want to dance?
{142559}{142631}- Do you know how to dance?|- Yes
{142717}{142771}Is just that this version is faster
{143028}{143059}Dance Ernesto!
{143074}{143128}Did you think it was a tango?
{143136}{143190}Mambo, mambo, mambo
{143252}{143400}Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you!
{143401}{143583}Happy birthday, Ernesto, Happy birthday to you!
{143585}{143650}Make three wishes Fuser
{143865}{143904}Friends, one moment please...
{143914}{144092}I believe this is a great opportunity to let Ernesto|and Alberto know, how grateful we are
{144097}{144348}Not just for having gotten here, but also for their|commitment and enthusiasm to the patients of San Pablo|during the three weeks you have spent here
{144362}{144459}For that reason, we have prepared|a little surprise
{144476}{144571}Tomorrow you will receive a raft to|continue your journey
{144578}{144730}and we will name it,|suggested by this night, The "Mambo Tango"
{144852}{144879}Thanks a lot
{144917}{145069}Speech! Speech!
{145116}{145272}Well...I feel obligated to thank this toast with something|more than a conventional gesture
{145298}{145439}But given the poor conditions in which we travel...|the only affectionate resource that we have is the word
{145465}{145595}And is by using it, that i want to thank you all,|all the staff of the colony
{145598}{145628}Thanks
{145636}{145831}You, that give us this magnificent display of affection|by celebrating my birthday as you would celebrate one of yourselves
{145866}{146077}And since we will leave Peru tomorrow, this|words also serve as a goodbye
{146088}{146220}in which i want to put all my effort to give|a recognition to the people of this country
{146267}{146380}that uninterruptedly have overwhelmed us with|nice gestures since we arrived
{146404}{146494}And i would like to highlight something more,|a little off topic of this toast
{146505}{146570}But don't worry, i won't dance
{146702}{146884}Although our meager personalities prevent us|from being spokesmen of your cause
{146912}{147150}We believe, even more after this journey, that the|separation of America in false and uncertain nationalities
{147155}{147210}is completely fictitious
{147237}{147383}We are a single mixed race, from Mexico|to the Strait of Magellan
{147407}{147503}So, trying to free myself from any|nationality load
{147528}{147653}I raise a toast for Peru and for America united
{147826}{147940}Cheers
{149290}{149343}What's up with you?
{149390}{149430}Do you know where the boat is?
{149470}{149512}No, i don't see it
{149624}{149683}I'm going to celebrate my birthday on the other side
{149726}{149806}Yes, of course, tomorrow when we find the boat|you will celebrate your birthday on the other side
{149806}{149840}- No, now|- No you won't
{149841}{149902}- My birthday is today not tomorrow|- I know Fuser but...are you crazy
{149912}{149977}You can't cross the river at night with all|those animals that can eat you raw
{149978}{150065}Mial, how many times in this journey did we thought|it was the end and look, here we are
{150070}{150108}- This time is different Fuser|-Why?
{150112}{150183}Because this time i won't be around to help you.|There's no way I’m getting in the river
{150187}{150231}You will always be with me Mial, come
{150236}{150336}Hey, come here you bastard mother fucker, come back here.|Think of me, your mom is going to kill me
{150350}{150412}Fuser, come back here.|Ernesto! Listen!

{150849}{150912}- What?|- Please tell me that someone has cross this river

{151796}{151848}- What's going on?|- Something is moving
{152056}{152098}The current is getting stronger
{152099}{152199}- What's going on?|- That moron that is swimming across the river. Come back, Ernesto
{152448}{152521}- Is that Ernesto?|- He is swimming this way
{152546}{152572}There he is
{152751}{152793}- He's tired|- You can do it Ernesto!
{152989}{153013}There he is
{153192}{153253}Come one. Come on. Come on.|Ernesto!!
{154510}{154569}He made it?!|Son of a bitch, he made it!
{154586}{154630}He made it! He made it!
{155139}{155177}I always knew he would make it
{155259}{155286}Son of a bitch
{156094}{156170}I'm going to miss you. Take care, ok?
{156284}{156411}- Papa Carlito is very sad|- Take care
{156446}{156510}- Good luck|- We will miss you
{156556}{156592}Thanks for everything
{156657}{156732}- Take care, ok|- You too
{157216}{157270}Take care kids
{157360}{157450}- Good bye Mauro|- We will always remember you
{159766}{159889}Near Leticia, Colombia|June 22nd, 1952|Km 10240
{160468}{160586}Caracas, Venezuela|July 26th, 1952|Km 12425
{160656}{160776}You know, i had memorized a speech filled with|anecdotes, and i can't remember a fucking thing
{160790}{160863}- That happens|- Yeah
{160948}{161025}You still have the chance to come and|work with me in Cabo Blanco, eh?
{161060}{161098}You can graduate and I’ll wait for you
{161133}{161175}I don't know
{161221}{161250}I don't know
{161316}{161476}Look Mial, all this time we spent on the route, something happened
{161557}{161636}something that i have to think about long and hard
{161877}{161931}So much injustice, eh?
{162047}{162089}Come on, the plane is leaving!
{162125}{162192}Wait, wait. This could be useful
{162255}{162288}You kept it

{162930}{162982}Fuser...
{163121}{163173}I have to tell you something important.
{163204}{163306}My birthday is not on April 2nd, it is on August 8th.|I told you only to motivate you
{163318}{163388}- I knew|- You knew? Son of a bitch
{163727}{163766}See you!
{163772}{163811}See you friend!
{164626}{164701}{Y:i}This is not the tale of impressive deeds
{164721}{164843}{Y:i}Is a piece of two lives taken in a moment|when they were cruising together along a given path
{164853}{164938}{Y:i}With identity of aspirations and a conjunction of dreams
{164963}{165097}{Y:i}Was our vision too narrow, too partial, too rushed?
{165109}{165169}{Y:i}Were our conclusions too rigid?
{165197}{165235}{Y:i}Maybe...
{165276}{165400}{Y:i}...but that aimless roaming through our enormous America|has changed me more than i thought
{165433}{165454}{Y:i}I..
{165468}{165495}{Y:i}...am not myself anymore
{165502}{165615}{Y:i}At least, I’m not the same inside
{167923}{167993}Eight years passed before the two of|them would meet again
{168043}{168124}In 1960, Granado accepted an invitation to move|to Cuba to work as a researcher.
{168125}{168291}The invitation came from his old friend Fuser,|that at the time was known as Commander Che Guevara,|one of the few influential and charismatic|leaders of the Cuban Revolution.
{168367}{168542}Ernesto Che Guevara fought for his ideals in Congo|and Bolivia, where he was captured by the Regulation Army and,|with the consent of the CIA, was assassinated in October of 1967
{168593}{168823}Alberto Granado, always faithful to his friend Fuser,|remained in Cuba, where he founded the "School of|Medicine of Santiago".  Today he lives in Havana|with his wife Delia, his three sons and grandsons.

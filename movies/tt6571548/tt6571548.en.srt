Fifteen-hundred a month.

You touched your finger to your eye?

Yes, sir.

Who'd do that in New York?

Yes, sir. You see that path over there?

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

788
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:36,333
Sir, they say
Lord Buddha walked on that path

[Pinky sighs]

1222
01:13:03,541 --> 01:13:05,750
They have a contact at the police.

1223
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:13,750
No one reported seeing what I did,
so they don't need you anymore.

[in English]
Why would you hit him like that?

1228
01:13:34,166 --> 01:13:37,086
- [Ashok] Hey, Pinky, calm down.
- How can you do that? Like he doesn't...

1229
01:13:37,166 --> 01:13:39,625
[Pinky] Don't tell me to calm down.
It's like you don't care.

- Do you like it?
- [Ashok] Pinky, let go of him!

- What are we, murderers?
- [Ashok] She won't do that.

I don't have anything, move along.

1256

You must have a rupee,
please give it to me, brother.

1257

- Move along.
- Where should I go?

1258

I told you to move along!
Does your head not work?

1259
01:15:43,375 --> 01:15:46,750
You want this? Should I take
my clothes off and give them to you?

You want me to get naked?

I've earned 36 rupees in six months.
Shall I give it all to you?

1264
01:15:56,291 --> 01:15:57,791
Then what should I eat?

1265

Give me some food, my child.

Get her out of here. She's lost her mind.

[Pinky] You were looking
for the key for years,

1272
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,750
but the door was always open.

1273

- Sir, I did what she asked me to.

1278
01:18:11,416 --> 01:18:13,208
Why would you drop her behind my back?

- Why would you do that?
- Sir, you can't blame me.

Why didn't you pack up and leave too?

1295
01:19:49,583 --> 01:19:52,500
Sir, it is not good
to starve yourself like this.

1296
01:19:53,833 --> 01:19:54,750
Sir, should I...

1297
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:57,125
The whole fucking thing was her fault.

1298
01:19:58,875 --> 01:20:00,291
Fucking bitch.

1299

2
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:33,471
Today, Germany is proud
of its economic miracle.

3
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,674
It's also proud to be the homeland
of Goethe and Beethoven.

4
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:43,449
But Germany is also the country
of Hitler, Eichmann

5
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,617
and their many henchmen and followers.

6
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:52,761
But just as the day
is comprised of day and night,

7
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,161
the history of each people

8
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,835
also has its bright and dark sides.

9
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:05,766
I believe that the younger generation
in Germany is prepared

10
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:10,676
to learn about Germany's entire history
and the whole truth,

11
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:17,277
something which their parents
sometimes have difficulty confronting.

12
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:22,121
THE PEOPLE VS FRITZ BAUER

13
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:30,364
FRANKFURT, the late 1950s

14
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:33,337
Dr. Bauer,
I've brought your groceries.

15
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:41,836
Shall I put them in the fridge?

16
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:11,299
Your car will be ready tomorrow at 7 a.m.
If you need me earlier, give me a call.

17
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,246
Have a nice evening.

18
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,185
Doctor?

19
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,867
Help! We need help!

20
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,850
I don't think anyone tried to kill him.

21
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:07,459
It looks more like the General unwittingly
mixed alcohol and sleeping pills.

22
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:10,527
Sleeping pills?
How many sleeping pills?

23
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,327
Two or three are missing.

24
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:16,974
More, and one might think it was
a suicide attempt, that he's overworked.

25
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,472
- True.
- Search the apartment thoroughly.

26
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,785
Kreidler residence.

27
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,624
It's the Federal Criminal Police.

28
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,725
- Kreidler speaking.
- Good evening, sir.

29
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,899
Your superior
almost lost his life this evening.

30
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,799
- An attempt on his life?
- No.

31
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,899
One could interpret it
as a kind of suicide attempt.

32
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,709
How is he?

33
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,236
He'll definitely recover.

34
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:01,348
The question is, can we afford to have
an attorney general of this kind?

35
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:05,886
A bit more pressure
and his job could become vacant.

36
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:08,957
Thank you, Gebhardt.

37
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,994
You're welcome.

38
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,829
- Have a nice evening.
- I will..

39
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,437
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina

40
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,882
We're continuing our conversation
with Mr. Eichmann on the Jewish question.

41
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:37,686
Mr. Eichmann, what would have been
the best outcome to the Jewish question?

42
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:41,354
I'll be quite honest with you, Mr. Sassen.

43
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:46,524
If we had killed 10.3 million
of the 10.3 million Jews,

44
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:53,862
I would be satisfied and would say,
good, we have destroyed an enemy.

45
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,804
We would then have fulfilled our mission
to protect our blood, our people,

46
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,808
and the freedom of the people of the world.

47
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:07,643
I too was to blame for our failure
to fully implement

48
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:12,345
the elimination of our enemy
as I had conceived it.

49
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,323
I was inadequate.

50
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,792
I'm guilty of that.

51
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:23,765
In truth,
I could and should have done more.

52
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,100
Good day, Mr. Attorney General.

53
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:42,383
I don't want to talk about it,
but thank you.

54
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,563
Fritz!

55
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:03,905
- Governor! What an honor.
- I wanted to visit you.

56
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:08,041
That's nice of you,
but it really was nothing.

57
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,039
You could've phoned.

58
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,483
Get in, we need to talk.

59
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,791
Leave us alone for a minute, please.

60
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,623
There are rumors, Fritz.

61
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,165
What kind of rumors?

62
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,631
That you tried to kill yourself.

63
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,977
I've needed pills
to help me sleep for ages.

64
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:46,776
As your boss I can't ignore such rumors.

65
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,450
I have a pistol.

66
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,654
If I decide to kill myself,
there won't be any rumors.

67
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,853
Dr. Bauer, how nice to see you well.
I heard about your mishap.

68
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,919
Don't worry, Kreidler, I'm fine.

69
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:32,025
But you look pale.
Some fresh air would do you good.

70
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,692
Yes, you're right.

71
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:39,897
Why not visit me at my lodge?
Do you like hunting?

72
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,903
Yes, but not for animals.

73
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,024
Was anyone in my office?

74
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:10,598
- I don't know. Is something missing again?
- The Schneider file.

75
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:14,602
- Summon all the state attorneys.
- Now?

76
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,006
Just the ones who work on special cases.

77
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,941
Come in.

78
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,785
- Good day.
- Good day, gentlemen.

79
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:16,601
Thank you for coming so late. As you
know, I was indisposed for a few days.

80
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,768
Cigar, anyone?

81
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,834
No, thank you.

82
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,311
Very well.

83
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:41,055
- How's the search for Bormann and Mengele coming along?
- No new developments.

84
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:47,689
- The search for Eichmann?
- I have nothing new to report either.

85
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,000
Mr. KÃ¼gler, Mr. Vogel,
anything to report?

86
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:55,828
- Well, er... Right...
- We've been busy with other cases.

87
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:59,236
There are no significant developments.

88
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:03,745
How could there have been?
You were only "indisposed" for a week.

89
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,744
Yes, what could happen in a week...

90
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:11,678
when nothing has happened
in the 12 years since the war either?

91
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,651
Very well. Thank you.

92
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:21,764
With all due respect, is that it?

93
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:27,297
- Pardon?
- Couldn't this have waited till Monday?

94
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:31,073
I'm sorry if I've disturbed
your family life.

95
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,809
I don't believe
I have to apologize at all

96
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:37,310
for wanting to spend my Friday evening
with my children.

97
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,984
And I don't believe that
I have to apologize.

98
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:45,883
While I was away, another file
disappeared from my locked office,

99
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,649
the file on SS Commander Schneider,

100
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,987
who now has a nice job
with Mercedes-Benz in Stuttgart.

101
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,322
My own office...

102
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,230
is enemy territory.

103
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,236
And we're not making any progress.

104
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,379
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

105
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:23,988
Dr. Bauer?

106
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,332
I have the Schneider file.

107
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:31,999
You do?

108
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:36,331
Last week you asked for my opinion
about the evidence against him.

109
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,872
Why didn't you say so?

110
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,338
I didn't want to embarrass you.

111
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,286
You're a rare exception, Angermann.
Thank you.

112
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:55,914
Good evening.

113
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,109
DIE JEW!!!

114
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:07,955
Operator? Please get me
the Tiefenthal family in Copenhagen.

115
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,333
- Tiefenthal, good evening.
- Hello, Walter. - Hello?

116
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,007
It's Fritz. Am I disturbing you?

117
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,803
Fritz, how are you? Margot, your brother!

118
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,413
- Very well, thank you. And you?
- Splendid.

119
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,144
- Here she is.
- Fritz, how lovely.

120
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,445
Margot, my love.

121
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,325
Am I disturbing you?
I just wanted to hear your voice.

122
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,529
Whats the matter? More death threats?

123
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,554
No. Everything's alright.

124
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:48,000
Maybe I will make it to Copenhagen
for your birthday.

125
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:51,071
That would be nice. We'd like that.

126
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,309
Shall I invite your wife?
We'd all be together again.

127
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:59,277
Yes, go ahead and invite her, if you like.

128
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,312
I have to work now...

129
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,353
Margot.

130
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,216
Goodbye.

131
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,072
Hello.

132
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,352
- Three oranges.
- Yes, sir.

133
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,628
Nick?

134
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,570
- Where's Nick?
- He's gone swimming with a girl.

135
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,676
- What are you grinning for?
- I think he likes her.

136
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,977
As long as he doesn't bring her here.

137
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,076
See you tomorrow.

138
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:17,122
Hi! Is there any dinner left?

139
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,463
What's wrong?

140
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,675
Good morning, Dr. Bauer.
I thought you were in Copenhagen.

141
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,606
I'm on my way to the airport.
I'm just taking some work with me.

142
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,712
- Use the time there to relax.
- Right.

143
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,655
That would make me the first person

144
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,088
able to relax at a family party.

145
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,493
- Morning.
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

146
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:02,096
This one looks private.

147
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:26,191
<i>Dear Mr. Bauer,
I am writing this letter to you today</i>

148
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:32,767
<i>in the hope that you will help in the
arrest of a man wanted for mass murder.</i>

149
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,500
It's for you.

150
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,631
<i>I have reason to believe
that Adolf Eichmann...</i>

151
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:44,275
<i>is living in a suburb of Buenos Aires,
Argentina, under an alias.</i>

152
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:50,420
<i>My daughter Silvia has fallen in love
with Adolf Eichmann's eldest son, Nick.</i>

153
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:56,122
<i>I read in a newspaper here
that your office is pursuing Eichmann.</i>

154
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,152
Adolf Eichmann

155
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:03,092
was responsible for transporting
millions of Jews from all over Europe

156
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,632
to camps, where they were murdered...

157
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,504
<i>If you are interested in my information,</i>

158
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,401
<i>please let me know.</i>

159
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:15,302
<i>Respectfully yours, Hermann.</i>

160
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:28,384
Please cancel my flight to Copenhagen

161
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,061
and get my sister on the phone.

162
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:34,685
Hello?

163
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,693
WIESBADEN, official residence
of the Governor of Hesse

164
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:52,846
Rosa Luxemburg? That's risky. What does
the Domestic Intelligence Service say?

165
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:57,215
They're probably still trying to find
out who she is. Come in. - Thanks.

166
00:17:58,644 --> 00:17:59,782
Take a seat.

167
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,421
Thanks.

168
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:04,719
Brandy?

169
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,493
No, thanks.

170
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:12,366
A man by the name of Lothar Hermann

171
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:18,802
believes he's discovered Adolf Eichmann
in Argentina.

172
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,809
High-ranking SS officer,

173
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:26,214
head of Department IV B4
at the Reich Main Security Office,

174
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,580
responsible for the
"relocation" of the Jews.

175
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:40,253
The investigation file
was opened way back in 1945.

176
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,764
And what are you going to do?

177
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,329
I want to put him on trial in Germany.

178
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,433
- Good.
- But I don't know how.

179
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,808
I just don't know how!

180
00:18:56,201 --> 00:19:01,344
Your righteous anger. That's good.
It keeps you young. - No.

181
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:06,379
I'm angry and powerless
and it's making me old!

182
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,926
What have I actually achieved?

183
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:14,591
The officers who tried to kill Hitler
are now no longer officially traitors,

184
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,595
but apart from that, nothing.

185
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,826
All our investigations have drawn a blank.

186
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:25,231
You know, after '45
I really thought we'd conquered evil.

187
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,203
I thought we'd be able
to build a new society...

188
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,380
free, just,

189
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,543
fraternal.

190
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,682
But people aren't interested in visions.

191
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,681
They just want a nice little house
and a nice little car.

192
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:46,227
They want Adenauer's damned reconciliation!

193
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:51,799
The restoration has defeated the revolution
yet again here in Germany!

194
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,602
I can't even breathe in here!

195
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,570
You knew it wouldn't be easy.

196
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:06,916
Eichmann.

197
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,713
That would be a coup.
He was the central figure,

198
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,753
the organizer of the Final Solution.

199
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,892
He would lead us to all the others.

200
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:22,265
A lot of people would have sleepless nights
if we put him on trial in Frankfurt.

201
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:25,392
I contacted Interpol,

202
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,965
but they're
"not responsible for political crimes".

203
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,998
The investigating authorities
are full of Nazis,

204
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:38,773
the Federal Criminal Police Office, the
federal and domestic intelligence services.

205
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,382
But you have your state attorneys.

206
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,451
Inside my own offices files go missing.

207
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,519
Rome wasn't built in a day either.

208
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:54,563
When we fought for the Social Democrats
during the Weimar Republic,

209
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:59,997
you were in more of a hurry than you are
now, here in your cozy official residence.

210
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,937
I appointed you Attorney General.

211
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:06,969
Get them, put them on trial,
but don't feel sorry for yourself.

212
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:12,644
In a few years,
Germany will be ready to face its past.

213
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,979
If Eichmann gets away...

214
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:21,379
I won't have the strength
to do this anymore, Georg.

215
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,859
I'm going to contact Mossad.

216
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,669
That's treason.

217
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:43,445
No one can doubt my patriotism.

218
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:49,485
- But if it gets out, you'll still go to jail.
- That's why I'm only telling you.

219
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,460
It's not a smart move.

220
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:03,565
And what do you think I should write
to Lothar Hermann in answer to his letter?

221
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:11,633
- You have a visitor. - What?
- From the Federal Criminal Police.

222
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:20,514
- Gebhardt?
- Yes. Our friend seems to be recovering.

223
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:29,022
Do you know why he cancelled
a visit to his sister?

224
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:34,427
For the usual reason, Gebhardt,
he's obsessed.

225
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:39,735
- Unfortunately, not everyone is ambitious.
- Everything in its time, Gebhardt.

226
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:45,365
You're alright, but our friends abroad
aren't as snug and cozy as you.

227
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:47,566
Who do you mean?

228
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,539
I don't know exactly and that's my problem.

229
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:55,010
Bauer has a new lead
but I don't know who it is.

230
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,542
He recently asked Interpol

231
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:03,988
if we could arrest an unnamed, high-ranking
SS officer who's on the run abroad.

232
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,964
- And your reply?
- We're not responsible for political crimes.

233
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,961
Exactly. He can't do anything.
He's totally isolated.

234
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:16,504
Don't underestimate him.

235
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,744
What's this? Danish?

236
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,983
- Yes.
- I can't read it.

237
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,946
It's a police report.

238
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:37,422
Bauer was caught several times
with male prostitutes in Denmark.

239
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:42,164
- He's queer?
- Yes.

240
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:49,437
The Jew is queer.

241
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:55,777
- If we catch him with a man, he's finished.
- Right.

242
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:03,074
Even a monk sometimes needs to screw.

243
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,221
May I?

244
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:11,989
Of course.

245
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:17,826
- Bon appétit, Angermann.
- Bon appétit.

246
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:36,111
- It's actually not too bad today.
- Sure.

247
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,619
This case is bothering me.

248
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,155
- What's the charge?
- It's a clause 175.

249
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:53,536
A young medical student
called Johann Kraus.

250
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:57,973
At medical school
he was denounced for being homosexual.

251
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:02,667
He was given two years in jail
for performing "unnatural sexual acts".

252
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:09,014
He was thrown out of college.
Now he's charged with male prostitution.

253
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,789
He earned five marks
for mutual masturbation.

254
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:19,061
I'm not sure what punishment
we should ask for.

255
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,198
Six months in jail.

256
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:27,897
- Where's the problem?
- Six months for mutual masturbation?

257
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:33,041
You seem to feel personally affected,
Angermann.

258
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,578
Yes, I am.

259
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:42,683
Mutual masturbation only became a felony
because the Nazis toughened clause 175.

260
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,217
The Federal Court of Justice
reached a clear verdict about that law.

261
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:51,719
It does not incorporate
any typical Nazi ideology.

262
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,958
I have to get back to work.

263
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:05,664
- Do you know the Valentin judgment?
- No.

264
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:09,902
Hamburg District Court,
summer 1951 or thereabouts.

265
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,751
You might find it interesting.

266
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:31,624
<i>The flight will take approximately
1 hour and 15 minutes.</i>

267
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,496
You can remove the blindfold.

268
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:56,002
I apologize for our security measures.

269
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:59,374
I'm sorry, I don't understand Yiddish.

270
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,145
Harel.

271
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,283
You can call me Isser.

272
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,244
Isser?

273
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:10,821
My name's Fritz.
I didn't expect you in person.

274
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:14,895
I didn't want you to think
we weren't interested in Eichmann.

275
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:20,398
In the last five months
I've conducted two investigations.

276
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:24,898
This file contains everything
we've been able to find out.

277
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,136
The lead is a dead end.

278
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:31,347
A dead end? That's not possible.

279
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:35,211
I wish it weren't so.

280
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:39,486
The first investigation, in October,
was conducted by one of my men.

281
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:43,188
But he didn't find anyone
who looked like Eichmann.

282
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,118
No Eichmann?

283
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,191
And who's this?

284
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:51,098
That's Nick Eichmann's mother,
Vera Leibl.

285
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:54,163
Vera Leibl-Eichmann, Eichmann's wife.

286
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,330
We conducted a second investigation.

287
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:01,442
Silvia Hermann got into the house
under a false pretence.

288
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,913
She's a brave girl.

289
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,342
Silvia Hermann was in the house?

290
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:11,013
She confirmed that a man of Eichmann's age
lives in the house,

291
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,415
and that Nick calls him "Tate".

292
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:18,518
- Nick calls him Father.
- So it's him!

293
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:23,089
- But we believe Vera Leibl remarried after the war.
- What?

294
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:32,103
I know. I had her mother questioned.
I don't believe a word she said.

295
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:35,600
Vera Leibl is supposed to have remarried

296
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:40,414
and then gone to America with her
new husband and Eichmann's three sons.

297
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:45,354
Her mother and her family claim that
they haven't heard from her since,

298
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:48,581
that they don't know
if she's in North or South America.

299
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:59,095
But Eichmann is an Austrian.

300
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,463
Francisco Schmidt.

301
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:06,066
We've checked him.
He's definitely not Adolf Eichmann.

302
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,216
And what's this?

303
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:17,042
The electric meter's
registered under those two names.

304
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:22,518
The electric meter? Two tenants,
Klement and Dagoto. Have you checked them?

305
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:30,258
Adolf Eichmann stole from the
wealthiest families in Europe.

306
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:34,459
Do you really believe
he's spent these past 12 years

307
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:37,337
living in this house?

308
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:47,314
This is our dossier on Eichmann.

309
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:53,455
One person claims he's working
in Nasser's team of advisers in Cairo.

310
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:58,591
Another one says he flies to and fro
between Africa and Switzerland.

311
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:04,624
This one says he lives in northern Germany,
where he breeds rabbits.

312
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:10,998
You should have checked the two names
on the electric meter.

313
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:16,108
My job is to defend the living
Jews of Israel, not the dead.

314
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,076
You can have your letter back.

315
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,387
I'm afraid we can't help you.

316
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,723
Mossad is a small secret service.

317
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:37,722
I have to deploy my people
against our Arab enemies.

318
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,234
- You speak German.
- Yes.

319
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:46,099
But I don't like it very much.

320
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:57,213
If you can find a second,
independent source

321
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:01,317
who can prove beyond doubt
that Eichmann is in Argentina,

322
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,488
we'll proceed.

323
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:23,211
- This is an outrage!
- Silence in court! Silence!

324
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:27,482
Silence or I'll have the courtroom cleared!

325
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,386
State Attorney Angermann,

326
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,547
please explain to the court

327
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,120
why you're requesting such an
outlandish punishment for Johann Kraus?

328
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:46,591
I'm referring to the Valentin judgment,
pronounced on June 21, 1951 in Hamburg.

329
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,768
In a similar case, Dr. Valentin,
head of the district court there,

330
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:55,405
fined two men three marks each
for engaging in homosexual activity.

331
00:33:56,734 --> 00:34:00,443
As the accused earned five marks
for an act of mutual masturbation,

332
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:04,585
I consider my demand
for a fine of five marks to be justified.

333
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,424
- He's got some nerve.
- Silence!

334
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:20,700
In the name of the people,
I pronounce the following judgment,

335
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:27,332
five months in jail
for homosexual prostitution.

336
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,241
The court also forbids Kraus

337
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:37,713
from having any contact
with men under 21 years of age in future.

338
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,721
The hearing is concluded.

339
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,513
I'd like to thank you.

340
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:14,352
- Thank me for what?
- I'm a friend of Johann Kraus.

341
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:20,295
You were there. You saw what an
inhuman sentence I got for Mr. Kraus.

342
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:23,427
What you did
requires a great deal of courage.

343
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:25,561
So...

344
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:28,767
I'd like to thank you.

345
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:35,400
- Come see me sometime.
- At the Kokett? I don't think...

346
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,250
Good morning, Miss Schutt.

347
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:47,483
Did anything unusual
happen while I was away?

348
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,783
Yes, a minor scandal.

349
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:55,254
Mr. Angermann asked the court to impose
a fine of five marks for a clause 175.

350
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:58,626
The judge was furious. You can imagine.

351
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,170
Yes...

352
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,465
I can that.

353
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,480
Mr. Angermann.

354
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:22,622
- Hello, Dr. Bauer.
- Good evening.

355
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:26,659
I've heard about your request
for a scandalous punishment.

356
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:29,763
- The five marks?
- A "fiver", as people say.

357
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:35,695
For vile, indecent homosexual prostitution?
You've got some nerve.

358
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:38,806
Senior State Attorney Kreidler
thinks it's a scandal.

359
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:43,836
And I think it's a scandal that
Mr. Kreidler is Senior State Attorney.

360
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:48,715
I need to discuss something with you.
At my apartment on Saturday? - Saturday?

361
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,410
It's official but confidential.
I don't want to discuss it here.

362
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:55,852
My wife's new kitchen arrives on Saturday.
How about Sunday?

363
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,658
- Alright. 11 a.m.?
- That's fine.

364
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,460
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

365
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:45,635
Take your coat off.

366
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:47,701
Of course.

367
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,746
Tchaikovsky.

368
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,482
<i>The Symphonie Pathétique.</i>

369
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:03,858
My favorite music.

370
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,429
It's nice. What's this about?

371
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:12,533
You wife will get over it, Angermann.

372
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:14,999
I'm sorry.

373
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:18,039
She's very Catholic and today's Sunday.

374
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:21,439
- How long have you been married?
- Two years.

375
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:25,412
- Children? Why not?
- No.

376
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:29,612
Why did you want to speak with me?

377
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,553
Read this.

378
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:06,353
What are you going to do?

379
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:08,650
I've contacted Mossad.

380
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:15,897
But they want a second, independent source
to confirm that Eichmann is in Argentina

381
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,566
before they'll start an operation.

382
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:21,994
Do you know "Der Weg"?

383
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:27,374
A right-wing propaganda pamphlet
from Buenos Aires.

384
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:34,573
Find out if the person using this name is,
in reality, Adolf Eichmann.

385
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:41,523
<i>Jews bribe Bonn to get aid for Israel.</i>

386
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:46,053
What will Mossad do,
if we find a second source?

387
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:54,703
Abduct Eichmann and put him on trial,
I'd say. What do you think?

388
00:39:56,827 --> 00:40:01,435
It's treason. The Federal Intelligence
Service is responsible for this.

389
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:05,744
Do you think the FIS don't know
where these people are hiding?

390
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,972
The CIA probably know, too.

391
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:13,651
- The most they'll do is warn Eichmann.
- I'm not so sure about that.

392
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:17,083
Even if most FIS employees
are former Nazis,

393
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:22,560
they have to submit to Adenauer's policies.
And he wants reconciliation with Israel.

394
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:27,836
Maybe he'd welcome a sensational trial
against a war criminal like Eichmann.

395
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:29,904
Are you serious?

396
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:35,076
Eichmann would name countless names
connected to the Final Solution.

397
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:39,675
Maybe even
that of Secretary of State Hans Globke.

398
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:51,721
Adenauer may want to improve Germany's
image, but he won't sacrifice Globke.

399
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:57,964
He controls the Chancellery, the intelligence
agencies, and the Christian Democrats.

400
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:03,503
His name would be mentioned
in connection with the deportations,

401
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:08,209
just for his co-authorship of the official
commentary on the Nuremberg Laws alone.

402
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,703
Globke is guilty.

403
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:15,478
And if Globke falls, it'll threaten
Adenauer's entire government.

404
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:19,084
And if Adenauer has a problem,
the U.S. have a problem.

405
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:23,117
No one, from Bonn to Washington,
wants Eichmann on trial.

406
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,754
Treason can't be the answer.

407
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,130
For God's sake, Angermann,

408
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:33,928
do you want justice or just a new kitchen?

409
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:40,607
If we want to do something for our country,

410
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,877
we'll have to betray it, in this case.

411
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,177
I need to think it over.

412
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:54,648
Forget it.

413
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,184
I've obviously made a mistake.

414
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:01,527
Go home, put in your new stove.

415
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,594
I hope you bought a German product.

416
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:10,896
Do you think you can persuade me
to commit treason this way?

417
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,612
You sound like
the man your opponents say you are...

418
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:18,679
Vengeful.

419
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:24,719
Go ahead and say what you mean,
like a vengeful Jew!

420
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,184
How dare you?

421
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,055
I'm daring to be your friend.

422
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,119
Good day.

423
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:42,860
We have a very young audience today.
But don't pull any punches, Dr. Bauer.

424
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:46,138
Open these young people's eyes.

425
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:49,641
Don't go easy on them.

426
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:09,219
I devoured everything he wrote
when I was at law school.

427
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:13,164
He used to be so optimistic, he...

428
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:22,243
- The guests will be here soon.
- We have time.

429
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,975
I can't.

430
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,982
Please don't, I...

431
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,720
I can't do it now.

432
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,215
Are you listening?

433
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:37,748
I fell out with the General.

434
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:42,055
What are you afraid of? That
you'll lose your job? - No.

435
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:44,188
That, too.

436
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,736
My brother would be pleased,
you'd earn much more money.

437
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:53,398
Don't start that.
I don't want to be a defense lawyer.

438
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:58,103
As long as we have no children,
we can manage.

439
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:03,876
- Some state attorneys even have children.
- Really? Then ask them how they're made.

440
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,754
- Karl.
- Good evening.

441
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:19,663
The kitchen's wonderful.
Thanks again, it was very generous of you.

442
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:24,100
Don't thank me,
fill this house with life at long last.

443
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:29,776
- Great, isn't it?
- Fantastic.

444
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:32,942
- Hello, my angel.
- How lovely! - Happy?

445
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:37,183
Good evening, viewers, and welcome
to our discussion in the Cellar Club.

446
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,051
Ingrid, it's on!

447
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:45,953
<i>Hesse's Attorney General
will answer our young audience's questions.</i>

448
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:49,457
<i>The discussion is about to begin right now.</i>

449
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,360
Dr. Bauer,

450
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,294
what can Germans be proud of?

451
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:28,859
I'm not sure
if I understand your question correctly.

452
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,435
People like you
have put us off Germany,

453
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:35,167
so how are we supposed
to find the energy and interest

454
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,938
to build something new here?

455
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,846
That wasn't my intention.

456
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:48,946
You know, when I...

457
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:52,826
When I first came back to Germany
after the war,

458
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,522
there was a young man
in my compartment on the train.

459
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:04,171
We didn't talk about politics,
he told me about himself...

460
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:06,330
Your boss, right?

461
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:07,997
Yes.

462
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:14,179
I'd like to watch it too, my angel.

463
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,248
The General in the Cellar?
This'll be interesting.

464
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:21,353
And I thought to myself...

465
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:24,021
For this generation,

466
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:29,787
it's worth returning to Germany from exile.

467
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:34,058
But if you want to know what I think,

468
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:38,039
on a purely human level I have to say...

469
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:40,372
it feels

470
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:45,570
as if the walls are collapsing on me
from all sides.

471
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:50,813
Hold this one up, that one up, this one
up, because they're all collapsing.

472
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:54,420
But, Dr. Bauer,
we have a democratic constitution.

473
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:56,518
We can be proud of that.

474
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:58,320
Listen...

475
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,555
I think we Germans...

476
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:12,297
We can't be proud of our forests and our
mountains. They're not our achievements.

477
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:16,841
We can't be proud
of Goethe and Schiller either,

478
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:18,940
nor of Einstein.

479
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:22,116
Because their achievements aren't ours.

480
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:27,254
We can only be proud
of the good things we've done ourselves.

481
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:30,023
Just today

482
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:35,854
a young person who means a lot to me
said that I'm sometimes hard, hurtful.

483
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:40,566
It's just as difficult for me as it is
for other people to always be good.

484
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:42,599
But I believe...

485
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:47,232
that the atmosphere here in West Germany

486
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:52,038
is determined by what we all do every day,
as fathers, as mothers, as sons.

487
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:56,144
You can write clauses,
you can write sub-clauses,

488
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:59,317
you can have the best laws,
but what you need

489
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:04,119
are people who actually live
these democratic ideals...

490
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,391
Sentimental nonsense!

491
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:10,191
Is that how he runs his office?

492
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:14,391
No one alone creates democracy,
we all do.

493
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:19,200
Don't take it to heart.
Father's one of the old guard.

494
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:25,377
This is the task we're all faced with.

495
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:29,641
And we mustn't lose our courage...

496
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:32,109
Come on, Karl.

497
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,969
What are you doing?

498
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:02,039
Come downstairs right now, please.

499
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,992
FRIEDRICH MORLACH, Journalist

500
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:26,469
He's a good informant, and he has contacts
to "Der Weg" in Argentina.

501
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:30,741
- Is he trustworthy?
- He was with military intelligence during the Third Reich.

502
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:36,013
Which means he'll be working
for the Federal Intelligence Service now.

503
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:41,016
- Maybe he's working for the other side?
- For the East Germans? - It's possible.

504
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,288
But he's a good informant.

505
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,321
In my opinion, he's one thing
more than anything, mercenary.

506
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:53,294
If he's working for the East Germans,
we'll end up in jail.

507
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:58,535
And if he's a loyal FIS man,

508
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:02,233
it's possible he'll warn Eichmann.

509
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:06,546
But if we're in luck,
he'll find a second source.

510
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:24,732
Let's risk it.

511
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:34,039
- You were great, Dr. Bauer.
- I was very moved by what you said.

512
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:36,504
Thank you.

513
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:40,749
Great, Dr. Bauer, really great!

514
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:50,787
Good morning.

515
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:55,390
- You were wonderful.
- Enough of that. Thank you.

516
00:50:56,319 --> 00:51:01,530
- Is it your birthday?
- No. They came from Governor Zinn with this telegram.

517
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:04,672
WELL DONE. KEEP IT UP.

518
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,367
Your mail.

519
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:12,509
I'm never going on TV again if this is
what it's like. You keep the flowers.

520
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:23,444
- What can I do for you?
- I need some information about a journalist.

521
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:26,586
He writes for "Der Weg" in Argentina.

522
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:32,324
His name's Klaus Eichmann.
That might be an alias for Adolf Eichmann.

523
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:36,825
You'd like to know that, eh?

524
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:43,535
It'd be a scoop if the vengeful TV attorney
found dear old Uncle Eichmann.

525
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:47,701
- Can you find out or not?
- Sure I can.

526
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:49,875
For the right price.

527
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:58,650
- These came in the last few days.
- Because of the TV show.

528
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:02,590
- And this came in the mail today?
- Yes. 9 mm.

529
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,952
You have a gun, right, Mr. Bauer?

530
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:09,359
Yes, that's right.

531
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,493
What caliber is your weapon?

532
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:15,597
- 9 mm.
- The same. Well, well.

533
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,204
I'd like to see your weapon.

534
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:22,236
Do you think he sent it to himself?

535
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:26,273
- I never said that.
- So why do you want to see my weapon?

536
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:31,877
What exactly was the reason
for your TV appearance, Dr. Bauer?

537
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:36,882
Get out!

538
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:41,454
If we're to get to the bottom of this,
you must cooperate.

539
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:43,287
Just forget it!

540
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:56,409
Could I have a word with you in private?

541
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:11,320
You misunderstood me just now, sir.

542
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:13,856
I support your work however I can.

543
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:22,732
A reliable source informs me that a person
you're looking for is currently in Kuwait.

544
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:27,536
The person in question
is SS officer Eichmann. Adolf Eichmann.

545
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:29,969
He's hiding in Kuwait.

546
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:33,606
Interesting.

547
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:38,913
We have indeed been looking
for Adolf Eichmann for some time.

548
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:44,357
But as you have often confirmed to me,

549
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:49,657
neither your office nor Interpol
are responsible for political crimes.

550
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,623
That's true, regrettably.

551
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,075
Make an official request
for his extradition.

552
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,822
Then we can work with
the local authorities.

553
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:02,967
Thank you, Mr. Gebhardt.

554
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:05,068
I'll see to it.

555
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:11,548
We have to protect our country
from its enemies.

556
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:15,345
Yes, you're right.

557
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,631
What did he want?

558
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:30,095
I need some fresh air.

559
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:35,670
I won't be coming back, Miss Schutt.

560
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:49,989
What did Gebhardt say?

561
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:52,017
It's over, Angermann.

562
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:56,522
- Go back to your normal routine, they're on to us.
- How?

563
00:55:56,753 --> 00:56:00,758
Without my asking,
he told me that Eichmann is in Kuwait.

564
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:05,530
- He knows we're looking for him.
- Morlach. It's my fault.

565
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:08,003
Nonsense, we had to try.

566
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:11,537
But if Gebhardt knows, Eichmann's gone.

567
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:14,408
He's too dangerous for too many people.

568
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:20,454
Maybe it was naive of me to believe
we could put him on trial in Frankfurt.

569
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:25,588
But it really would've been something.

570
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:28,958
Gebhardt!

571
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:34,435
He had the nerve to say we have to
protect our country from its enemies.

572
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:37,467
The ex-SS officer tells me that!

573
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:43,534
I fought for the Social Democrats
on the streets during the Weimar Republic.

574
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:49,040
My father fought for our Kaiser
in World War I. Tell me, Angermann.

575
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:52,919
Be honest,
am I an enemy of our country?

576
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:56,648
No, Fritz, you're not.

577
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:05,188
- Goodbye, Karl.
- What are you going to do now?

578
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:09,133
Sleep. Sleep for a very long time.

579
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:17,774
We're closing.

580
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:04,787
<i>I don't have one.</i>

581
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,156
<i>I play my game</i>

582
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:11,259
<i>just like I am,</i>

583
00:58:11,855 --> 00:58:14,893
<i>incognito, incognito.</i>

584
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:17,161
<i>Come play with me</i>

585
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:19,505
<i>from now on we're</i>

586
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:23,042
<i>incognito, incognito.</i>

587
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:27,608
<i>No one would ever find out</i>

588
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:32,247
<i>what we are or what we were.</i>

589
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:38,225
<i>So come and let us go all the way,</i>

590
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:47,062
<i>as long as we remain incognito.</i>

591
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:57,874
Come in.

592
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:02,649
I just wanted to say good evening.
You sang beautifully.

593
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,977
Hello, Mr. Angermann. Come in.

594
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:14,856
- You remember me?
- Sure.

595
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:17,724
But I never thought you'd come.

596
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:20,101
I've been very busy.

597
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:25,037
You look unhappy, State Attorney.

598
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:27,699
A lost cause.

599
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:38,647
Is there anything I can do
to cheer you up?

600
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:54,300
You know the prices.

601
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:58,128
But you're family, State Attorney,

602
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:00,301
you get it for free.

603
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,044
Please don't.

604
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:08,378
Why else are you here, so late at night?

605
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:13,084
I don't know...

606
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:18,259
I have to go, I'm afraid.

607
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:20,318
You sang beautifully.

608
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,006
- Hello?
- I've some news.

609
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:44,274
How dare you call me
in the middle of the night.

610
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:59,166
- You can't do this.
- Calm down! Calm down!

611
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:01,827
What's wrong, State Attorney?

612
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:04,937
You want to catch a big fish, so listen.

613
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:09,904
Klaus Eichmann isn't your man.
The surname's a coincidence.

614
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:12,975
Cut out the games.
I know you betrayed us.

615
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:16,977
Me? Before you've paid me?
Are you stupid?

616
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:22,415
Maybe you'll get paid twice.

617
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:27,053
Does the name Willem Sassen
mean anything to you?

618
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:32,294
He's Dutch and was an SS war correspondent.

619
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:35,099
After the war, he was Peron's press agent.

620
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:40,899
But now the political situation in Argentina
isn't so rosy, he's got money troubles.

621
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:44,743
Who doesn't?

622
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:50,180
Sassen lives in Buenos Aires.

623
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:53,216
And for years now...

624
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:00,325
he's been taping interviews.

625
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:04,287
It would seem that dear Uncle Eichmann

626
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:08,063
would like to revise his place in history
a little.

627
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:12,832
Sassen said he would be prepared

628
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:16,140
to have his memoirs written up for him.

629
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:22,382
- You mean those are Adolf Eichmann's memoirs?
- Sure.

630
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:27,112
But this is just one part.
Sassen must have hundreds of these tapes.

631
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:31,948
He thinks it'll be a huge scoop.

632
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:36,888
But because he's short of cash,
he's decided to sell some of the tapes.

633
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:40,267
In any event, it proves...

634
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:46,137
that Adolf Eichmann is in Argentina.

635
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:52,140
<i>You agree that your part in the decimation
of the European Jews is indisputable?</i>

636
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:55,939
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

637
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:59,112
<i>I transported them, after all.</i>

638
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:03,385
<i>If I hadn't, they would never
have reached the slaughterhouse.</i>

639
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:10,162
<i>I'm comparable to an air force officer leading
his squadron to attack a German city.</i>

640
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,258
<i>Is he condemned?</i>

641
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:15,927
<i>Why do people condemn us?</i>

642
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,903
<i>I didn't kill anyone.</i>

643
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:25,168
<i>The ground crews armed the bombers
and we transported the Jews...</i>

644
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:36,887
Besides Morlach only the Governor
knows we're looking for Eichmann.

645
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:39,252
So why should Gebhardt

646
01:03:39,882 --> 01:03:43,557
suddenly mention Eichmann,
totally out of the blue?

647
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:48,992
I don't know.

648
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:56,938
But you contacted Gebhardt yourself,
because of the death threats.

649
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:02,406
Maybe he said it for no reason,
pure coincidence.

650
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:06,882
- Because he knows we're working on this case.
- Maybe.

651
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:12,189
Dagoto or Klement?

652
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:16,023
Mossad should have checked these names.

653
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:21,596
I wonder how Eichmann supports himself?
Does he have a job?

654
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:28,405
Maybe he works for that dubious firm,
like so many Germans in Argentina,

655
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:31,144
- CAPRI?
- Yes.

656
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:33,638
Or Mercedes.

657
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:41,081
Schneider!
He works for Mercedes-Benz in Stuttgart.

658
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:43,589
SS Schneider.

659
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:13,415
I'll catch my death of cold!

660
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:20,419
Turn the fan on, please.

661
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:32,095
STUTTGART, Mercedes-Benz HQ

662
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:36,438
- Yes?
- Mr. Schneider, someone to see you.

663
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:42,173
- There's nothing in my appointments diary.
- Dr. Bauer, the Attorney General of Hesse.

664
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:45,181
Send him in.

665
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,152
Thank you.

666
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:55,356
- Good day, Mr. Schneider.
- Sir.

667
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:58,160
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

668
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:01,127
How can I help you?

669
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:06,967
I'm conducting an investigation
into your activities with the SS.

670
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:24,049
No calls, please.

671
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:29,562
I could put your case
at the bottom of the pile.

672
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:35,390
If?

673
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:41,167
I believe you work in the personnel
department here. Is that correct?

674
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:44,039
Yes.

675
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:50,041
I would like to know
if a Mr. Dagoto or a Mr. Klement

676
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:54,253
works for Mercedes-Benz in Argentina.

677
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:15,607
Well?

678
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:22,810
We have our second source.

679
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:28,346
If Eichmann isn't gone already.

680
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:32,277
I'm happy to pay.

681
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:34,652
Really.

682
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:40,485
I don't expect any favors.

683
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:43,287
As you wish.

684
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:50,697
Good morning!

685
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:06,474
Hello, my angel. I'm sorry I didn't call.
We worked all night.

686
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:11,373
Thank you. They're lovely.

687
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:17,518
Karl...

688
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:21,319
We're going to have a baby.

689
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:30,901
- Good day, Miss Schutt.
- Morning, sir.

690
01:10:33,762 --> 01:10:37,608
Please book me a flight to Paris
for next weekend.

691
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:40,404
- Return, one week later.
- Certainly.

692
01:10:40,636 --> 01:10:43,310
There's a request for an appointment.

693
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:46,850
Dr. Schiller, head of the central office,
would like to see you.

694
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:50,723
- Would it be alright after your trip?
- What does he want?

695
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:56,794
It's about an arrest warrant for a
Mr. Eichmann, Adolf. File number 6842.

696
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:03,429
Ask Dr. Schiller how soon he can be here.

697
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,398
Yes, sir.

698
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:13,545
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

699
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:18,514
- Cigar?
- I'd love one.

700
01:11:26,515 --> 01:11:27,926
Fire away.

701
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:32,022
Does the name Adolf Eichmann
ring any bells with you?

702
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:34,459
Of course.

703
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:37,402
We're working on his case.

704
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:46,673
I don't wish to offend you,
but you should intensify your activities.

705
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:50,576
A certain Tuviah Friedman,
a private investigator from Israel,

706
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:54,318
is giving us hell at the central office.

707
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:58,355
He's in contact
with a Mr. Hermann from Argentina.

708
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:01,390
He says he knows
that Eichmann is hiding there

709
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:05,365
and that you know about it
and aren't doing anything.

710
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:11,462
Tell Mr. Friedman that
the Frankfurt Attorney General's Office

711
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:13,900
is doing its work conscientiously

712
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,607
and that we know for sure

713
01:12:17,933 --> 01:12:23,349
that Mr. Eichmann is in Kuwait
and not in Argentina.

714
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:30,948
But tell him not to take any
further action. Do you understand?

715
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:34,986
Because if Eichmann is warned in Kuwait,

716
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:37,853
he'll probably disappear forever.

717
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:44,604
Call a press conference, Angermann.

718
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:46,938
When I return,

719
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:52,073
we'll announce that we're quite sure
to have traced Eichmann to Kuwait.

720
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:02,145
Dr. Bauer, I...
Have a successful trip.

721
01:13:04,913 --> 01:13:07,086
What's the matter, Angermann?

722
01:13:08,117 --> 01:13:09,892
I'm going to be a father.

723
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:14,935
Come to the airport with me.

724
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:23,509
- Gebhardt speaking.
- It's me, Kreidler.

725
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:27,175
The General really does seem
to be interested in Eichmann.

726
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:32,712
He met Dr. Schiller from the central office
of the State Justice Department this morning.

727
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:37,717
He told me they are looking for
Mr. Eichmann in Kuwait now.

728
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,527
Yes, some of our fellow countrymen
are living in Kuwait.

729
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:46,762
The General is on his way to Paris.

730
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:50,630
Maybe our colleagues
from the Federal Intelligence Service

731
01:13:50,893 --> 01:13:53,134
could keep an eye on Mr. Bauer,

732
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:56,543
in view of the recent death threats
against him.

733
01:13:56,865 --> 01:14:00,210
Yes, that's a good idea.
I'll see to it. Thank you.

734
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:09,985
I know I can't be a good father.

735
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:12,759
Why do you think that?

736
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:17,825
Mr. Mahler and I are long-time colleagues.

737
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:21,226
We have a few skeletons in the closet.

738
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:24,533
You can speak quite openly here.

739
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:29,806
According to rumor,

740
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:36,580
the Gestapo didn't just hound you because
you were a socialist with Jewish origins.

741
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:40,687
It's said you had problems
with the Danish vice squad.

742
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:42,546
Yes.

743
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:44,891
There were certain incidents.

744
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:53,031
For some time now I've had the feeling
that we have similar interests.

745
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:01,604
I've met somebody.

746
01:15:02,598 --> 01:15:05,704
- A loose "woman".
- How many times have you met?

747
01:15:07,736 --> 01:15:08,736
Once.

748
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:13,953
What can I say, Karl?

749
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:17,252
You know you could end up in court.

750
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:22,560
The first time, you can use the excuse
that you didn't know that the "lady"

751
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:25,188
wasn't a lady.

752
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:28,030
But not the second time.

753
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:36,805
My wife Anna-Maria and I have lived
apart for years. She in Copenhagen...

754
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,874
and I here.

755
01:15:40,102 --> 01:15:43,640
I think we have one of the
happiest marriages in the world.

756
01:15:45,173 --> 01:15:49,588
If your wife's a good companion, you don't
need to be afraid of raising children.

757
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:52,690
I think you'll be a terrific father.

758
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:57,287
Thank you for being so open.

759
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:00,094
However...

760
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:03,161
We pay a heavy price.

761
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:09,607
You must never see the young man again.

762
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:14,609
- Right?
- Yes.

763
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:56,984
- Yes?
- The General is flying on to Israel.

764
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:59,791
That's where Jews fly to.

765
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:02,728
Maybe he'll contact Mossad.

766
01:17:04,987 --> 01:17:07,297
If we can prove that, it's treason.

767
01:17:08,256 --> 01:17:09,701
Exactly.

768
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:34,154
Dr. Bauer.

769
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:36,293
Haim Cohen.

770
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:40,860
Call me Herman. It's good to
meet you as a colleague at last.

771
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:44,259
JERUSALEM, Justice Department

772
01:17:44,693 --> 01:17:46,730
Isser you know, and this is Zvi.

773
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:49,032
I was born in Frankfurt,
eastern Germany.

774
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:53,371
Did you know that I studied
in Frankfurt, western Germany?

775
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:56,310
I should visit you. Take a seat.

776
01:17:56,905 --> 01:18:01,285
- Something to drink?
- No, I'd like to get down to business.

777
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:06,416
I've found a second, independent source

778
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:11,024
who's confirmed that Eichmann
is using the alias Ricardo Klement.

779
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:13,926
You said that on the telephone.

780
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:17,034
We need to check your source.

781
01:18:17,826 --> 01:18:21,103
We've lost months
and you want to check my source?

782
01:18:21,463 --> 01:18:26,811
Eichmann could change his alias and move.
This is unbelievable!

783
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:30,907
Any second-rate cop could catch him!

784
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:38,347
Dr. Bauer, we understand your anger.

785
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:43,126
Zvi is very competent.
He'll head the new investigation.

786
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:49,863
It's like Harel says, if we can trust
the second source, I'll lead an operation.

787
01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:54,898
Who is the second source?

788
01:18:55,864 --> 01:18:58,105
I put my first source at risk

789
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:02,804
and Isser had the nerve to let
the Hermann family do his investigating.

790
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:06,379
My second source stays secret.
My word is enough.

791
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:10,287
Ricardo Klement is Adolf Eichmann.

792
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,851
If you don't act now,

793
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:18,161
I'll go to the German authorities.

794
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:21,063
If they were any help,
you wouldn't be here.

795
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:24,226
You reckon?

796
01:19:27,362 --> 01:19:29,103
We'll do what we can.

797
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:31,010
Thank you.

798
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:33,309
There's one more thing.

799
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:39,212
When you get Eichmann,
I'll request his extradition to Germany.

800
01:19:40,008 --> 01:19:45,151
I don't want him to be condemned here
as the only one behind the Holocaust.

801
01:19:45,847 --> 01:19:51,024
Eichmann must go on trial in Frankfurt. We
must confront the Germans with their past.

802
01:20:03,231 --> 01:20:06,178
I'll support your request
for his extradition.

803
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:08,913
That's great. Thank you.

804
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:19,556
- Good luck.
- I'll do my best.

805
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:26,990
When I'm back in Frankfurt,
I'll announce to the press

806
01:20:27,255 --> 01:20:30,293
that I believe Eichmann is in Kuwait.

807
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:32,904
Good.

808
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:40,904
I've called this press conference,

809
01:20:41,369 --> 01:20:44,907
because the Federal Criminal
Police Office inform me

810
01:20:45,974 --> 01:20:51,219
that Adolf Eichmann, who was responsible
for the deportation of the Jews,

811
01:20:52,314 --> 01:20:55,090
is hiding in Kuwait.

812
01:20:56,284 --> 01:20:58,560
We've requested his extradition.

813
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:04,161
Not all at once...

814
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:49,412
Just a moment.

815
01:22:07,622 --> 01:22:11,627
<i>The German people
feel great satisfaction in the knowledge</i>

816
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:15,472
<i>that by paying compensation
to the victims of Nazism</i>

817
01:22:15,964 --> 01:22:20,640
<i>it is making a contribution
to the building of Israel.</i>

818
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:32,085
<i>I said in the Knesset that present-day
Germany is not yesterday's Germany.</i>

819
01:22:32,314 --> 01:22:34,555
<i>I wish the Chancellor every success</i>

820
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:39,398
<i>in his efforts to guide Germany
to democracy and international cooperation.</i>

821
01:22:54,069 --> 01:22:55,980
- Yes?
- We've got him.

822
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:02,112
Thank you.

823
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:47,165
Extra! Extra!
Adolf Eichmann seized in Argentina!

824
01:23:47,655 --> 01:23:52,434
Extra! Extra!
Adolf Eichmann seized in Argentina!

825
01:23:57,632 --> 01:23:59,305
Dr. Bauer!

826
01:24:02,404 --> 01:24:04,145
Another glass, please!

827
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:09,119
- We did it, Karl!
- I can't believe it!

828
01:24:11,646 --> 01:24:17,426
- If we'd met somewhere quiet, you could have told me more!
- I don't know any more myself!

829
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:19,461
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

830
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:25,671
We were all lined up,
ready for morning roll call,

831
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:29,307
before the feared camp commandant.

832
01:24:30,298 --> 01:24:34,508
He yelled, Schumacher,
why are you in a concentration camp?

833
01:24:36,671 --> 01:24:39,777
Schumacher said,
because I belong to the defeated party.

834
01:24:41,409 --> 01:24:43,514
He wasn't scared of anyone.

835
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:48,352
Kurt Schumacher spent 12 years
in concentration camps, but I...

836
01:24:50,351 --> 01:24:54,857
In an open letter,
I bowed down to the Nazi party.

837
01:24:56,124 --> 01:24:59,731
They printed it in the newspaper.

838
01:25:00,361 --> 01:25:04,776
The Socialist Bauer bows down to us.
I was released.

839
01:25:09,671 --> 01:25:12,515
I've never forgiven myself for it.

840
01:25:14,576 --> 01:25:17,455
Schumacher never gave in to them.

841
01:25:18,546 --> 01:25:23,825
One should never give in to tyranny, Karl.
Never.

842
01:25:30,258 --> 01:25:33,205
I should go up. I can't drink any more.

843
01:26:00,555 --> 01:26:02,432
<i>I am a man</i>

844
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:05,865
<i>and have all the things</i>

845
01:26:06,294 --> 01:26:09,207
<i>that make a man a man.</i>

846
01:26:10,798 --> 01:26:13,404
<i>And even if you laugh at me</i>

847
01:26:13,735 --> 01:26:15,715
<i>all that I am</i>

848
01:26:16,437 --> 01:26:19,475
<i>is a sweet little freak of nature.</i>

849
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:23,814
<i>I am a man, take a good look at me,</i>

850
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:26,951
<i>I don't mind if you do.</i>

851
01:26:30,485 --> 01:26:35,867
<i>Because this little freak of nature</i>

852
01:26:36,324 --> 01:26:38,736
<i>leaves a massive trace on me.</i>

853
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:48,908
Singing a song like that is reckless.
Aren't you afraid?

854
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:55,480
- You remember Johann Kraus? Five-mark Johann?
- Yes, why?

855
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:58,714
He's the love of my life.

856
01:27:02,417 --> 01:27:04,397
Just a moment.

857
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:07,532
They promised they'd let Johann go.

858
01:27:09,624 --> 01:27:12,764
- I'm sorry.
- Don't get up, State Attorney, good evening.

859
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:17,471
Love will be the ruin of us all, eh?

860
01:27:27,475 --> 01:27:29,421
This one's nice, too.

861
01:27:31,946 --> 01:27:33,584
Yes...

862
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:37,025
Our secret needn't cost you
your job or family.

863
01:27:37,552 --> 01:27:41,364
I'm good at keeping secrets.
Incognito, incognito...

864
01:27:44,425 --> 01:27:49,272
- What do you want?
- Was Bauer behind the Eichmann abduction?

865
01:27:51,899 --> 01:27:54,812
I don't know what you're talking about.

866
01:27:56,704 --> 01:28:01,744
Very well. Keep them. Maybe your wife
would like to see them before...

867
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:05,850
- No! Wait, please!
- I'll give you a week.

868
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:14,024
Either you denounce Bauer for working with
a foreign secret service or you go to jail.

869
01:28:44,385 --> 01:28:48,424
- What do you think about the Eichmann abduction?
- If only we'd nabbed him!

870
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:52,570
Yes, that would've been a terrific success.

871
01:28:54,862 --> 01:28:56,569
Come in.

872
01:28:56,964 --> 01:28:59,911
- You wanted to speak to me?
- Yes. Come in.

873
01:29:07,575 --> 01:29:09,054
Is everything alright?

874
01:29:12,113 --> 01:29:14,593
I haven't seen you all week.

875
01:29:18,653 --> 01:29:20,394
Private business.

876
01:29:23,424 --> 01:29:26,371
I'd like you to accompany
me to the Governor.

877
01:29:28,129 --> 01:29:32,737
Zinn's been negotiating with the Federal
Government about Eichmann's extradition.

878
01:30:04,031 --> 01:30:05,533
Fritz!

879
01:30:06,033 --> 01:30:10,175
- Where's Rosa Luxemburg?
- You don't miss a thing.

880
01:30:11,773 --> 01:30:13,946
This is State Attorney Angermann.

881
01:30:14,175 --> 01:30:16,553
- Pleased to meet you.
- Sir.

882
01:30:16,978 --> 01:30:18,889
- This way.
- Thank you.

883
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:23,154
Congratulations to you both.

884
01:30:23,785 --> 01:30:26,493
The other state attorneys
must be very impressed.

885
01:30:26,721 --> 01:30:28,928
Yes, impressed by Mossad.

886
01:30:30,158 --> 01:30:32,638
And that's how it should stay.

887
01:30:33,194 --> 01:30:35,435
Of course. I understand.

888
01:30:35,696 --> 01:30:40,577
- A drink, perhaps? This is something to celebrate.
- No, thank you.

889
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:43,746
What's the Federal Government's decision?

890
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:47,781
Sit down, please.

891
01:30:49,577 --> 01:30:53,491
I'm sorry, but they're not going to
apply for Eichmann's extradition.

892
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:57,152
He's going on trial in Israel.

893
01:30:57,852 --> 01:31:00,765
But the Israelis promised me.

894
01:31:00,988 --> 01:31:04,902
Haim Cohen supports my extradition request.

895
01:31:05,793 --> 01:31:08,171
Cohen is just a lawyer, Fritz.

896
01:31:08,696 --> 01:31:11,108
- This is much bigger.
- It certainly is.

897
01:31:11,666 --> 01:31:14,840
Don't you know why Ben-Gurion
and Adenauer met in New York?

898
01:31:16,604 --> 01:31:19,676
Israel wants to buy German weapons.
That's what they discussed.

899
01:31:20,575 --> 01:31:24,990
Germany has suspended arms deals until
it's certain the trial will be in Jerusalem.

900
01:31:25,213 --> 01:31:29,628
They're really nervous in Bonn.
Especially Globke, as you can imagine.

901
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:35,097
No one wants a government crisis here.
Apart from the Soviets.

902
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:39,595
And that's why the Americans will do all
they can to protect Adenauer's government.

903
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:42,671
And the Israelis need German weapons.

904
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:44,268
Here...

905
01:31:48,703 --> 01:31:51,684
This is the Justice Department's
letter of refusal.

906
01:32:05,887 --> 01:32:07,833
I told you, Georg.

907
01:32:08,990 --> 01:32:13,837
If I don't get Eichmann,
I won't have the strength to carry on.

908
01:32:14,161 --> 01:32:18,667
But you brought Eichmann to justice.
It's your success.

909
01:32:18,966 --> 01:32:21,173
No! It's Israel's success.

910
01:32:21,602 --> 01:32:25,209
It would've been mine
if Eichmann had stood up in a German court

911
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:30,316
and named all the Nazi war-profiteers
who now lead this republic.

912
01:32:32,113 --> 01:32:34,252
There'll be other chances.

913
01:32:38,085 --> 01:32:39,826
But not for me.

914
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:11,187
Where to, Dr. Bauer?

915
01:33:30,071 --> 01:33:32,244
What are you going to do now?

916
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:43,860
What are you going to do?

917
01:33:47,688 --> 01:33:50,897
I think I'm going to resign from my post.

918
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:55,331
You mustn't! You mustn't!

919
01:34:04,005 --> 01:34:07,009
Vogel and KÃ¼gler are on to something.

920
01:34:09,143 --> 01:34:11,282
Heard of the Wroclaw documents?

921
01:34:13,347 --> 01:34:17,762
They're reports written by HÃ♪ss,
the commandant of Auschwitz.

922
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:22,259
They contain lists of SS men
and their victims.

923
01:34:24,125 --> 01:34:28,938
Concrete acts, confirmed by the
camp commandant. Do you understand?

924
01:34:29,997 --> 01:34:35,675
We can put Auschwitz on trial.
A cross-section of the whole camp.

925
01:34:37,972 --> 01:34:39,315
But...

926
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:43,412
But I don't believe in it anymore.

927
01:34:44,245 --> 01:34:46,748
They always find a way to stop us.

928
01:35:02,463 --> 01:35:04,909
Stop the car! Stop!

929
01:35:09,804 --> 01:35:13,718
- You're getting out here?
- Yes. I have to.

930
01:35:15,176 --> 01:35:16,985
I have to get out now.

931
01:35:20,948 --> 01:35:22,791
Please don't give up.

932
01:36:14,902 --> 01:36:16,279
Come with us.

933
01:36:52,072 --> 01:36:53,244
Come in.

934
01:36:54,108 --> 01:36:56,179
Senior State Attorney Kreidler.

935
01:36:56,410 --> 01:36:58,219
Tell him to come in.

936
01:36:59,146 --> 01:37:02,389
- You wanted to talk to me?
- That's right.

937
01:37:04,051 --> 01:37:07,430
You're dealing
with the Angermann case personally.

938
01:37:07,955 --> 01:37:09,229
Certainly.

939
01:37:09,523 --> 01:37:11,093
I have to.

940
01:37:12,226 --> 01:37:16,368
A state attorney who behaves so indecently
should be dealt with properly.

941
01:37:17,998 --> 01:37:19,909
Is that a problem for you?

942
01:37:20,434 --> 01:37:22,380
I hear you were very close.

943
01:37:23,971 --> 01:37:26,076
Just be aware of the fact

944
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:31,187
that Mr. Angermann reported
his indecent behavior with that boy himself.

945
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:33,253
Yes, of course.

946
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:38,496
He was the dearest member
of your young guard, eh?

947
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:46,528
- Are you biased in this affair?
- No, Kreidler!

948
01:37:48,028 --> 01:37:49,166
Do your job.

949
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,911
But you can be sure

950
01:37:55,502 --> 01:37:57,345
that I'll do mine.

951
01:37:59,206 --> 01:38:01,186
As long as I live,

952
01:38:01,876 --> 01:38:04,186
no one will stop me anymore.

953
01:38:15,556 --> 01:38:18,628
<i>In 1962, Adolf Eichmann
was hanged in Jerusalem.</i>

954
01:38:19,627 --> 01:38:25,942
<i>In 1963, Fritz Bauer confronted Germany
with its past at the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials.</i>

955
01:38:26,233 --> 01:38:32,149
<i>His part in Eichmann's arrest was not
made public until 10 years after his death.</i>

955
01:38:33,305 --> 01:39:33,499

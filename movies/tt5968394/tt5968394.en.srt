1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,721
A matter
of establishing what this is.

2
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:20,221
If indeed this was an act of terrorism,
then who caused it?

3
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:23,770
All of the electricity
across the entire Eastern Seaboard is out.

4
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:27,020
People ordered to stay
indoors until further notice and to...

5
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,843
is nothing short of apocalyptic.

6
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,574
Metropolitan areas,
in addition to Chicago,

7
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,198
are completely surrounded.

8
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,238
We 're still awaiting
an official announcement,

9
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,791
but Congress is believed to
have accepted unconditionally

10
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,914
all terms of armistice offered.

11
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:50,485
And with
power restored in the last few hours,

12
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,420
- martial law...
- This is taking too long.

13
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,674
Now all US military forces
are returning to their bases

14
00:00:55,764 --> 00:01:00,098
with orders to turn in arms
and stand down until further orders...

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,388
Reports are spreading now
from Tokyo, Jakarta, Rome.

16
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,689
Contact with outside news sources
has been sporadic

17
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,392
since the devastating failure
of the Trenton power grid,

18
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,318
but eyewitnesses confirm...

19
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,648
That the majority of international
governments appear to comply...

20
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,695
Officer, I need to get up north.

21
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,659
Where you going, Detective?

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,240
You not get orders?

23
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,872
Stop the car. Stop the car.

24
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:25,603
Take your hands off the wheel.

25
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,627
- Stop the engine.
- Um...

26
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,123
- Oh, my...
- Stop the car!

27
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,947
Appear to have followed the US' lead

28
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:40,715
and are entering into negotiations
with this first wave of Legislator forces.

29
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,770
Look, should we call the school?
There may be a plan.

30
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,724
I'm not rolling over! We need to get out
and regroup, then fight back.

31
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,568
J... John!

32
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,248
John.

33
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,252
Turn around.

34
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,047
Turn around!

35
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,088
Come on, John.

36
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,630
The shutdown was very orderly.

37
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,994
There '3 been
a sort of a level of cooperation

38
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,098
that you can see here.

39
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,815
I love you, Rula.

40
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,802
Another reminder
to avoid Lake Shore Drive

41
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,114
if you're not one of the lucky thousands
invited to tonight's unity celebration.

42
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,310
This event has been in the works
for the better part of a year,

43
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,956
with Mayor Ed Lee expected to attend.

44
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,705
All signs are pointing to this...

45
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,803
You ever see the sun set
on the other side of the lake?

46
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:16,425
No. The sun sets this side, dummy.
West side.

47
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,562
Yeah.

48
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,940
I know.

49
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,753
I'll come and see you later, all right?

50
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,107
Hey, yo.

51
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,199
Boat's all ready, man,

52
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,083
so you pull this off today,
we're out of here.

53
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,900
Hey, cool it.

54
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,611
Got eyes on me 24-7.

55
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,744
No shit. Check her out, up there.

56
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,371
Yo, every day,
that witch be watching me like clockwork.

57
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,129
Hey, I see a rat.

58
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,920
Narc!

59
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,393
Oh...

60
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,402
Let's go.

61
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,820
- Your bro's a legend, man.
- Yo, come on.

62
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,648
When's the last time you seen one?

63
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,279
A roach?

64
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,691
A long time ago. Come on, man, let's go.
Look, I can't be late today.

65
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,152
I should break in like your brother did
and bulldoze that whole ant heap.

66
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,079
They can't hide down there forever, man.

67
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,411
I'll be ready in a minute.

68
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,669
I don't have much time.

69
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:20,839
But I wanted to see you.

70
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,849
Well, then we'd better get
business out of the way.

71
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,322
I can't do this.

72
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,619
Let's go to bed.

73
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,961
What are we doing? This is a mistake.

74
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,152
There's no such thing as a mistake.
There's only fate.

75
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,776
- You're a cop. You won't get caught.
- I'm sorry.

76
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,430
Wait. Wait.

77
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,051
You forgot what you came here for.

78
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,865
Beware Greeks bearing gifts.

79
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,757
- I got a secondhand ID.
- So the Eagle has landed?

80
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,388
Phoenix. You should pay attention.

81
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,936
You got a visual?
Secondhand is secondhand.

82
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,389
You still got authorization from below?

83
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,849
They're planning something big.

84
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,480
They don't exist.

85
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,434
That's what we said about aliens.

86
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,821
That's funny.

87
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,985
Remember Wicker Park?

88
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,200
Yeah, the roaches fucked them into dust.
They're gone.

89
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,329
Don't use that word.

90
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,702
What?

91
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,538
Since when has this become
your personal work space?

92
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,621
The resistance wasn't wiped out
after Wicker Park.

93
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,798
They went to ground. I figured it out.

94
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,713
They're communicating
through the classifieds.

95
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:31,224
Their network regrouped here in Pilsen,
right under our noses.

96
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,892
You got nothing that shows that.

97
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,477
Theses... These are memorials.

98
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,728
Legislators got 'em all.
You're searching for ghosts, Bill.

99
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,434
If we don't act now,
we're facing a full-blown insurgency.

100
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,020
I suggest you keep that idea to yourself.

101
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,902
Well, too late.
Already kicked it downstairs.

102
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,483
It's on the commissioner's desk.

103
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,033
Why did you do that?

104
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,199
They're not gone.

105
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,848
- You weren't followed?
- No.

106
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,269
Training's over.

107
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,121
And you back this?

108
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,530
I back Number One.

109
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:40,494
The way to the Closed Zone
is through Soldier Field.

110
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,715
Team goes tonight.

111
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,867
It's Soldier Field.

112
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:21,962
The Unity Rally?

113
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,456
Get what you need from Barbosa.

114
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,504
Soldier Field
is miles from the Closed Zone.

115
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,631
- How's that get us back inside?
- I'm trusting you.

116
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:33,004
- He'll deliver.
- He has to. Today's the day.

117
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,607
Gabriel Drummond, 7:04 am.

118
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,133
Oh, there it goes.
There it goes...

119
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,060
Oh, it's over. It's a squeaker.

120
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,184
That was a matter of a minute and a half.

121
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,906
Walk around,
take a look from other angles.

122
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,922
Oh!

123
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,222
Fifteen minutes.

124
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,972
Another reminder
to avoid Lake Shore Drive

125
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,551
if you're not one of the lucky thousands
invited to tonight's unity celebration.

126
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,513
This event has been in the works
for the better part of a year,

127
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,019
with Mayor Ed Lee expected to attend.

128
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,022
All signs are pointing to this being
one of those rare occasions

129
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,320
when the Legislators
might just make an appearance.

130
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,774
Traffic's being routed
around Soldier Field,

131
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,483
and folks are showing up early.

132
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,194
What a night here this is.

133
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,159
Lots to celebrate. Another reminder...

134
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,250
You got it or what?

135
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,199
If you're not
one of the lucky thousands

136
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,286
invited to tonight's unity celebration.

137
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,497

00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,298

00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,756

143
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,104
What a night here this is.
Lots to celebrate.

144
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,190
Here.

145
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,256
Another reminder to avoid Lake Shore Drive

146
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,632
if you're not one
of the lucky thousands...

147
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,271
Hope you put it to good use.

148
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,221
This event has been in
the works for the better part of a year.

149
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,952
All signs are pointing to this being

150
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,040
when the Legislators
might just make an appearance.

151
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,952
Please.

152
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,334
I haven't done anything.

153
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,300
- I haven't done anything.
- Hey. Hey, leave her alone.

154
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,455
Please, can we just...

155
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,623
Off-planet transport...

156
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,570
Hey, hurry up, bro.
You got to check this out.

157
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,917
All she needs is gas.

158
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,422
- Damn, yo.
- Right?

159
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,251
She's fast, too.

160
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,669
Got to be to get past what's out there,

161
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,507
but there's no checkpoint,
so we get to the other side,

162
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,595
and it's freedom, baby.

163
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,309
Let's hope so.

164
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,875
So, did you get the cigarette?

165
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,233
- Of course I got it.
- Shit, then we're out of here.

166
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,527
Yo, I'm about to come like Scarface
on these roaches.

167
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,163
Bah!

168
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,614
I'm not going down without a fight.

169
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,270
Yo, what did you trade for that?

170
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,956
Straight cash, and it's fully loaded.

171
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,583
Oh, the cash we need for gas?

172
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,129
Chill, man. It's an investment.

173
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,164
Why are you always trippin', man?

174
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,865
People are jonesing
for what we got out here!

175
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,926
What, you think you in
the big leagues now, Jurgis, huh?

176
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,008
Yo, that shit right there
will get us in some serious trouble.

177
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,685
I'm sick of this hand-to-mouth hustling.

178
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:56,773
You think I'm not?

179
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,850
- I got to go, man.
- Go?

180
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,379
- We're partners, man. Any...
- Partners?

181
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,566
Man, I take the risk.

182
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:07,817
I saw someone get taken today.

183
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,950
Yeah, well, I'm out here hustling,
closing the deals,

184
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,224
while you're at the crib
just kicking back, chilling, huh?

185
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,330
Look, I got to take care
of myself and Rula.

186
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,328
You and Rula?

187
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:19,706
All right, man, fine.

188
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,538
Have your side piece. I'll go solo.

189
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,313
I'm not playing with you, Jurgis.

190
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,238
- Hey, come on. Chill, chill.
- Yo, I'm not...

191
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,502
Hey, hey, hey, chill, yo.

192
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,056
Shit!

193
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,322
Get in the car.

194
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:13,847
Special Branch
ain't got nothing better to do?

195
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:19,102
From your local.

196
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,439
What do you want?

197
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,400
What do you know about Phoenix?

198
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,448
I'm not one of your narcs.

199
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,059
What are you doing down here, Gabriel?

200
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,269
You're lucky to have your job.

201
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,829
I didn't ask you for it.

202
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,751
I don't want you winding up
like your brother.

203
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,170
- You mean dead?
- I mean on the wrong side.

204
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,050
It runs in the family.

205
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,014
You have no right
to be talking about my family.

206
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,384
Your dad was my partner.

207
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,804
I have a responsibility to that.

208
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,183
You have a choice to make yourself.

209
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,637
Don't make the wrong one.

210
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,102
Get out of here.

211
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:43,773
You got my money?

212
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,475
Hey, let's do this. I got the cigarette.

213
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,822
Hey, hey, hey. You said to bring it here.

214
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,365
Get in.

215
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,196
Yo, I'm just trying to get paid, man.

216
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,310
- No, I'm not getting in, no.
- Come on.

217
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,542
Hey, hey, hey.

218
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,207
Hey, yo, look, man.

219
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,499
Man, you came to me, remember?

220
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:12,966
- Put this on.
- Yo, what is this?

221
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:19,932
Yo, what is this?

222
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,474
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

223
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:27,102
Yo. No one said nothing
about going nowhere.

224
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,188
Get out.

225
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,412
Follow me.

226
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,290
Let's go.

227
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,264
Wicker Park.

228
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:51,901
What are we doing here?

229
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,110
You want to get paid, don't you?

230
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,240
That jacket's still too big for you.

231
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,423
Baby brother.

232
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:09,768
What happened?

233
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:14,147
Before we could get the roaches,
they got us.

234
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,179
I'm the only one that made it out.

235
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:21,859
Wait, your...

236
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,702
Your bug...

237
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,412
- Where's it at?
- Gone.

238
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:30,076
- No, that's impossible.
- A few of us are off the grid now.

239
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,686
- Few of who?
- I don't know the others.

240
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,122
The others don't know me.
It's better that way.

241
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,581
I don't exist anymore.

242
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,958
In some ways, I am dead.

243
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,675
You couldn't come find me?

244
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:52,228
[wanted to, but there's narcs everywhere.
You know that. Even in Pilsen.

245
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,019
The Drummond brothers are back.

246
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,772
For good. I'm dialed in, Rafe.

247
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:03,196
My friend, he lives by the lakeshore.
He has this boat.

248
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,385
- We have this plan and...
- G.

249
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,009
- We're gonna go across the lake...
- G.

250
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,955
This... is the plan.

251
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,625
I knew you'd get it.

252
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
So, what'd I get you?

253
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,390
Information.

254
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,177
Information for who?

255
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,134
Only Number One knows.

256
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,720
- Number One?
- Mm-hmm.

257
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:35,815
Who the hell is that?

258
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,639
No one knows. It's like I told you.

259
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:39,854
It's better that way.

260
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,902
Bad times coming.

261
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,827
Here. This will help you get out.

262
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:52,912
Go to the lake house.

263
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,747
Not next week, not tomorrow. Now.

264
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,495
- Before it get dark.
- Come with me.

265
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,547
Not again, Rafe. Not again!

266
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,253
We just got to take care of ourselves.

267
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,213
What'd Dad say
the day we tried to get out?

268
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,099
Regroup. Fight back.

269
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,594
- And he dead now.
- Watch your mouth.

270
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:18,396
Let the roaches come and take
what they want if they want it so bad.

271
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,019
And we can start all over, Rafe.

272
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,070
We can get back to the way
that things used to be.

273
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,360
Don't you get it?

274
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:28,399
Harmony, peace, unity... it's all bullshit.

275
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,367
It's a lie, Gabe.
They gonna take everything.

276
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:34,162
In a few years,
they'll have stripped us to nothing.

277
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:42,705
Got one more chance to light a fire
big enough so the whole world can see.

278
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:48,089
To prove to everybody out there
that the roaches can be beat.

279
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,556
Light a match.

280
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,430
Ignite a war.

281
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:57,053
Long as we fight back, we got a chance.

282
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,434
Why you always got to be the hero?

283
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,019
You got to pick a side.

284
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,978
You got to pick a side, Gabe.
One day, you have to, or this is it.

285
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,526
You got to go.

286
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,911
Gabe, when this is all over,

287
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,422
I'll find you.

288
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,426
I promise.

289
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:29,804
You just got to go.

290
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,182
Now.

291
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,758
Got him.

292
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:21,784
Baby, what's going on?

293
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:22,995
We're getting out.

294
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:25,788
Okay.

295
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,629
Well, before we do that,
why don't we just...

296
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,802
Grab this.
And take only what you can carry.

297
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,681
What did you do?

298
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,303
There's gonna be some trouble.

299
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,789
Gabriel, what is that supposed to mean?

300
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,263
What, come on, you're freaking me out.

301
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:49,944
Rafe...

302
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,112
is alive.

303
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:54,949
Your brother?

304
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,073
Yeah.

305
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:58,911
Nice try, Gabriel.

306
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,104
What did he say? Where did you see him?

307
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,585
That's about enough
to last us a couple weeks.

308
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,834
After that,
we're gonna have to make it on our own.

309
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:13,916
No, we won't make it past
the first checkpoint.

310
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,420
Not if we go across the lake.

311
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,156
I've got a boat that we can use.

312
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,671
There's nothing over there.
There's no law. It's dangerous.

313
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:20,926
You're not listening to me.

314
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:23,808
They're planning something.

315
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,560
Okay, and if we go, we are involved.
No way.

316
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,853
- Baby, baby. Come on.
- No.

317
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:34,982
Gabriel, if you want to keep me safe,
you need to stay.

318
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,235
Please.

319
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,611
- No, I can't.
- No, Gabriel.

320
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:44,466
- I can't, I can't.
- Gabriel, this is crazy.

321
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,739
Please, let's talk about this!

322
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:53,417
Type this. Send it to PDHQ. Fast.

323
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,053
Move!

324
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,365
- Can they track us?
- No. I got a few mirror IPs.

325
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,432
Got him. There's your target.

326
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,639
Consider yourself
as informed as Special Branch.

327
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,362
So, who is he?

328
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:11,401
Just another collaborator. Mayor's deputy.

329
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,607
No, no.

330
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:15,704
Who is he?

331
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:16,948
He carries the bomb.

332
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,723
- Classifieds.
- Got room for one more?

333
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:04,666
One more.

334
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:07,756
The late edition?

335
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,880
They proofread the scratch till 3:30.

336
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,301
Real important, Rittenhouse.

337
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,717
Yeah. Thank you.

338
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,549
This is a request going out.

339
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,385
Hi.

340
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,354
Who wants to go first?

341
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,673
Get him off the table.

342
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,726
Next. Hurry.

343
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,057
Get her in here.

344
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:01,646
His heart rate went below the limit
and distressed his bug.

345
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:04,323
Drones are maternal to all bugs.
We have to get yours out now.

346
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,009
Got it.

347
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,341
Don't move. I'll stitch you up.

348
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,496
All right.

349
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:46,258
These three bugs are the three insiders.
Heart attack, cancer, unlucky car wreck.

350
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,210
Downtown folks, spotless records.

351
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,226
The other three are good enough
for your drivers.

352
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:51,426
I need two now.

353
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,360
All right, my shift ends
at 7:00 am. Tomorrow.

354
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:56,431
That's the latest
I can log them in as deceased.

355
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:59,402
That's as long as they're good for.
They get ID'd after that, they're it.

356
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,291
You're gonna need these plates
to keep the bugs down in their mouth.

357
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:09,448
Semper fi, Sergeant.

358
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:54,448
I always did believe in life after death.

359
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:11,721
Is that you, Father?

360
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:14,182
Come on back.

361
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,316
What you got me?

362
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,443
The last of it.

363
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,163
Wait here.

364
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,403
Now, I assume I don't have to
tell you what they'll do

365
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:50,529
if they find this on your person.

366
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:51,963
Where'd you get this?

367
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:53,134
Their ship crashed, too.

368
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:57,390
Attaches best to natural fiber,
human hair, cotton or wool,

369
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,196
but because it's not chemically based,
it's undetectable to scanners.

370
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,541
Because it's organic,
it passes through all security.

371
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:03,896
You can smuggle this in anywhere.

372
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:06,857
And when you arm it, it's a chameleon.

373
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:11,656
How do we arm it?

374
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:27,271
Double tap gives you about 60 seconds.

375
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,065
Drivers are downstairs.

376
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:54,801
Holy hell.

377
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,302
Take that off.

378
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,504
You may as well be wearing a target.

379
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:09,430
All right, these implants get logged
as deceased at 7:00 am. Tomorrow.

380
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:11,005
After that, you're dead to the world.

381
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:13,768
You know what happens to Pilsen
if they correctly ID us.

382
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,613
Any contact, before and after,
with any friends or family

383
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,486
puts the entire operation at risk.

384
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,281
Remember...

385
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,248
he gets us to them.

386
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,091
No one gets taken alive.

387
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,106
Okay.

388
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:01,569
You ready? Here we go.

389
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:14,172
Courage.

390
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,690
- Make a right out of here.
- I got it.

391
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,042
People of Chicago...

392
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:07,682
welcome to a special night
of coming together,

393
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:09,759
of sharing.

394
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:14,226
And tonight, we have
some very special guests joining us.

395
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:19,359
Before first contact,
our political system was broken.

396
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:23,318
We were fighting among ourselves
in the halls of Congress

397
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:25,650
and on the streets of this great city,

398
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:28,030
slowly bleeding to death.

399
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:31,034
And we needed change.

400
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:34,333
We needed someone to show us a better way.

401
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:38,041
Well, the facts speak for themselves.

402
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:42,963
Natural resource production
has increased tenfold.

403
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:49,174
Employment is at record levels.
Crime at an all-time low.

404
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,138
Pays to play the game.

405
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:56,097
And we have the Legislators to thank

406
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,398
for this American renaissance!

407
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:21,376
So, will you please join me
in giving them a real hometown welcome

408
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:24,379
that truly shows our appreciation

409
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:28,463
for nine years of peace and prosperity!

410
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,739
Mary Johnson, 8:39 pm.

411
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,001
Window down, sir.

412
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:06,167
Enjoy the show tonight, sir.

413
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:09,253
[crowd continues cheering.

414
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:21,484
I'm inside.

415
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:22,768
"E" section.

416
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:05,018
Ladies and gentlemen,
the United State of America.

417
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:20,328
What a performance,
ladies and gentlemen.

418
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:24,162
A colorful reenactment of nine years ago.

419
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:31,691
They're running this thing like clockwork.
We got to give it to 'em.

420
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,761
He's leaving the VIP section now.

421
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,196
What a privilege it is...

422
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,495
Can you see him?

423
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,117
I see him.
He's on the field. We're in position.

424
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:30,947
He's not coming to '.“'E.

425
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:33,259
He's going the other way,
towards the tunnel behind you.

426
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,283
Got it.

427
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:42,908
Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise to greet our Legislature.

428
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:54,010
J' Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the light J'

429
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:57,345
J' Neither army nor a bullet fired J'

430
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,388
J' Did stop them at first sight J'

431
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,093
J' They have gifted us with harmony J'

432
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,846
J' And sweetest sleep at night J'

433
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:11,982
J' Their truth is marching on J'

434
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:17,859
J' Glory, glory Hallelujah J'

435
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,322
J' Glory, glory J'

436
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:23,121
J' Hallelujah J'

437
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:27,577
J' Glory, glory Hallelujah J'

438
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:29,111
J' Their truth is... J'

439
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,233
He's coming right at you.

440
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:32,873
J' ...is marching on J'

441
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:40,881
J' ...fore the dawn
Now we're alone no more J'

442
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:44,013
J' On a wing away,
the night takes flight J'

443
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:46,311
J' The sun has won the warJ'

444
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:51,483
J' Their light will carry on J'

445
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:54,023
J' Glory, glory J'

446
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:56,981
J' Hallelujah J' -

447
00:58:57,075 --> 00:59:02,069
J' Glory, glory Hallelujah J'

448
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:03,370
J' Glory, glory... J'

449
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:04,742
Robert Watts?

450
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:09,243
It's Ben. Ben Simon. Drexel Drive.

451
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:10,751
Keep it moving.

452
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:12,375
Sorry about it. Sorry about it.

453
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:13,924
Hands off of me.

454
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,798
Allow me time to translate.

455
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:22,385
Breathe between sentences.

456
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,101
I And answer to their call I.

457
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:31,523
J' This peace we carry on J'

458
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:36,320
J' Glory, glory Hallelujah... J'

459
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,109
We need to allow them
to communicate first.

460
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:41,487
J' Hallelujah J'

461
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:45,867
J' Glory, glory Hallelujah J'

462
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:53,957
J' Their truth is marching on J'

463
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:09,311
this is Zero-4
citywide dispatch. Heavy smoke.

464
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,853
We got half in zone security unit...

465
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,581
unaccounted for, possible Legislator.

466
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:34,892
Come on.

467
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:39,981
Don't move!

468
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:46,112
Get in the car! Get in!

469
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:48,285
Keep them out there!

470
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,783
Keep that crowd back!
You are hereby ordered...

471
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:43,544
[5]

472
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:27,508
[5]

473
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:51,074
Come on! We got to go!

474
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:47,209
Oh, no.

475
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:49,419
Oh, fuck.

476
01:05:57,912 --> 01:05:59,868
You and me go together.

477
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,270
We got till 7:00 am.

478
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:50,792
What people
need to understand is this is a war.

479
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,248
Between order and chaos.

480
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:56,842
Between democracy and anarchy.

481
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:59,800
Commissioner Igoe,
is the insurgency reorganizing?

482
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:03,433
"Insurgency." No one's
mentioned that word since Wicker Park.

483
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,956
There are rumors
that hunters are being brought in.

484
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:09,393
Measures are being taken,
but to preserve their effectiveness,

485
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:10,974
I'm not gonna discuss them.

486
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:14,027
And we will keep you updated
as the situation evolves.

487
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,673
- No, a question over here.
- Thank you.

488
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,703
Commander.
Commissioner Igoe is ready for you.

489
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:32,753
They're bringing in hunters this time
from off planet.

490
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,956
- They can't do that.
- The one ID we have,

491
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,963
the ex-priest from Saint Anthony's,
points to Pilsen.

492
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,260
You know what that means.

493
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:40,928
We can clean this up ourselves.

494
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,676
Yeah, nobody's talking about a cleanup.

495
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:44,803
Pilsen isn't Wicker Park, Commissioner.

496
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:45,894
Yeah, not yet.

497
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:47,560
They torch this neighborhood,

498
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:50,059
the network will go to ground
just like they did last time.

499
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:54,017
You know, you're too sentimental, Bill.
Pilsen's a goddamn armpit.

500
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:55,612
Only good for whoring.

501
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:59,022
Their leadership is in Pilsen.

502
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:01,324
- You know that for a fact?
- I'm working on it.

503
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:02,571
Not fast enough.

504
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:07,406
If we do ourjob, we can locate
the end of the thread, their Number One,

505
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,161
and unravel the whole network.

506
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:10,833
Look, let me stop you right there.

507
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:12,956
Hey, that ship has sailed.

508
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:16,164
And I have to explain why
to them in there.

509
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:21,504
I got a positive ID at Soldier Field,
the man I've been tracking for two years.

510
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:23,134
I need time to bring him in alive.

511
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:24,680
You're not listening.

512
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,934
Right now, we have resources behind us.

513
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:31,642
Now, you might not see them,
but they're there. They're protecting you.

514
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:36,356
And the more irrational you become,
the more unnecessary noise you make,

515
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:39,233
the harder it's gonna be
to invite you into the lifeboat.

516
01:08:39,324 --> 01:08:40,324
Do you understand me?

517
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,367
If there's any chance
of getting off this dying rock,

518
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:45,660
I'm not gonna waste it.

519
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:49,200
Pilsen is already dead.

520
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:05,839
They hate the way we smell.

521
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:07,893
How about that?

522
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:16,896
Sorry I got to leave you here, Bill.
Can't take anybody with me.

523
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:19,648
If you only knew
what was inside this place.

524
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:21,942
The commissioner's privilege, sir.

525
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:23,408
You know it.

526
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:28,862
And don't get hung up on this, Bill.
Play ball.

527
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:32,866
And keep your hands clean.
Let the hunters do the dirty work.

528
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:37,795
And I'll tell our friends down below
they got our full operational support.

529
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:42,171
Now, go home, relax,
take the night off for once, huh?

530
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,712
All the second-stage tanks
now pressurized.

531
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:47,468
Thirty-five seconds and counting.

532
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:50,220
We are still go.
Thirty seconds and counting.

533
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:53,640
Feels good. T-minus 25 now.

534
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:56,043
Let's ride this one out, Bill.

535
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:57,603
Confirming rank and identity.

536
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,059
Commissioner Eugene Igoe.

537
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:01,895
Let them take the lead.
Just until it dies down.

538
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:03,570
Security clearance complete.

539
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:05,636
- Ten, nine...
- Prepare for descent.

540
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,321
Ignition sequence start.

541
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:12,906
Six, five, four, three, two, one.

542
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:25,418
I can't protect you now.

543
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:26,930
I know.

544
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,470
I have faith in you.

545
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:36,645
Why?

546
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:39,606
Why do you? Nobody else does.

547
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:46,272
We could go away together.

548
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:52,787
That's not our story.

549
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,120
Dance with me.

550
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:29,570
You have a job to do.

551
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:48,088
Move, move, move!
Let's go! Let's go!

552
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:50,511
Get back! Move back!

553
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:52,172
Dad, wake up!

554
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:57,643
You got to get moving now!
You got to move back! Hurry up!

555
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,062
Mom, wake up. Mom, wake up.
Specials are here!

556
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:06,561
Everyone, get on the ground now!
Get down! Get down!

557
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:14,198
Specials are here! Specials
are here! Specials are here! Wake up!

558
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:27,331
That's it. Enough of this shit!

559
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:30,506
Move, move, move!

560
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:32,678
Don't turn your head. Face the wall!

561
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:36,633
Specials! Specials are here!

562
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:40,553
Move now!

563
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,936
- Gabriel Drummond.
- Get your hands on the wall.

564
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,076
Do you know him? Have you seen him?

565
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:05,332
Rafael Drummond. Who knows him?

566
01:13:05,423 --> 01:13:08,343
- Hands on the wall.
- Hey, look what we got here.

567
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:10,066
Hey, where'd you get all this money, huh?

568
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:13,048
What are you selling to get
all that money? Carry a weapon?

569
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:15,758
I asked you a question, punk.

570
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:21,015
Try that cowboy shit with me?
Let's see where that goes, huh?

571
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:22,515
Are you kidding me?

572
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:24,143
Who the cowboy now, huh?

573
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,402
Huh?

574
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:31,170
What are you gonna do, Gabriel?

575
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:32,699
Shoot him?

576
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:34,618
Go ahead, shoot.

577
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:38,277
Kill the bastard.
You know it'll make you feel better.

578
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,120
Come on, get rid of some of that rage.

579
01:13:42,293 --> 01:13:43,813
- Take them all in.
- Move, move, move!

580
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:47,024
In this neighborhood,
we shoot our own guys.

581
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:51,087
Target one man, Rafael Drummond,
moving on a fraudulent implant.

582
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:31,042
Hello?

583
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:33,840
I'm sorry I couldn't say it before.

584
01:14:36,055 --> 01:14:37,386
I'm doing this for Charlie.

585
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,634
There's someone here
who wants to talk to you.

586
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:47,351
Hello, Evan.
Tell us where your friends are going.

587
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:57,569
This is a security message.
If you see something, say something.

588
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,660
Ladies and gentlemen,

589
01:14:59,704 --> 01:15:03,572
last call for boarding for buses heading
to New York City and Montreal,

590
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,247
departure set for 7:00.

591
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:24,350
All units, stand down.
Requisite hunter units traveling.

592
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,937
I don't want to go in.

593
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:30,252
Last call for boarding

594
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:32,267
for buses heading to New York City
and Montreal.

595
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,041
Just push the door and come through.

596
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:35,507
I don't want to go in.

597
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:38,171
You're making us late, Charlie.
Would you just push the door.

598
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:43,830
Fine.

599
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:46,562
Thank you. Thank you very much.

600
01:17:06,664 --> 01:17:08,529
On the ground now!

601
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,573
Hands behind your head!

602
01:17:38,112 --> 01:17:41,104
Sit down! Sit down!

603
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:40,416
Hey!

604
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:45,094
Hey!

605
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:49,297
You! Get down now! I said down!

606
01:18:57,107 --> 01:18:58,187
It's not over.

607
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:37,181
Somebody kill me!

608
01:19:59,253 --> 01:20:00,288
I want a lawyer.

609
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:02,874
In another ten...

610
01:20:04,174 --> 01:20:06,916
nine and a half hours,
there'll be nothing left of Pilsen.

611
01:20:07,011 --> 01:20:08,217
I said I want a lawyer.

612
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:11,421
You and I both know those days are gone.

613
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:15,091
I didn't need a warrant
when I burned your boat.

614
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:18,519
You work for me now, Gabriel.

615
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:20,637
I told you...

616
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:22,765
I'm not one of your narcs.

617
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:28,362
I'm not gonna do shit for you.

618
01:20:28,449 --> 01:20:30,690
I'm not asking you to do anything for me.

619
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:33,400
I'm not even asking you
to do anything for your community.

620
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:37,112
Even though plenty of people
are going to die.

621
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:42,121
Like your father,
you're more of a family guy.

622
01:20:43,213 --> 01:20:44,213
Blood first.

623
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:51,089
When's the last time you saw your brother?

624
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:57,466
I'm not gonna tell you shit.

625
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:00,393
So you can do
whatever you want to do to me.

626
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:46,769
You got a visitor.

627
01:21:49,405 --> 01:21:50,611
Family day.

628
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:53,614
You want to say something?

629
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:57,535
Go ahead. He can hear you.

630
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:01,455
Baby brother, why...

631
01:22:04,086 --> 01:22:05,166
Why didn't you listen?

632
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:07,586
What you doing here, man?

633
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:13,469
No.

634
01:22:14,555 --> 01:22:18,013
No! No! Gabe! Hey, don't!

635
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:22,226
Don't let 'em use you!
You hear me? You hear me?

636
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:25,270
Man, I told you not...
I told you not to be a hero, Rafe.

637
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:27,643
- Don't do it!
- I told you not to be the hero!

638
01:22:27,985 --> 01:22:29,441
Look, don't do it, Gabe.

639
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:32,652
I told you, I'm already dead, man.

640
01:22:32,739 --> 01:22:34,149
Do it, and I'll make sure he lives.

641
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,190
You expect me to trust you?

642
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:39,701
Gabe, you there? Gabe?

643
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Fuck!

644
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:54,375
Listen to me carefully, Gabriel.

645
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:59,805
Right now, the Legislators
are preparing to level Pilsen

646
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:01,348
for what your brother's done.

647
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:04,930
Same way they leveled Wicker Park.

648
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,896
Our roundups are over.

649
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:11,858
You are our one way into the network.

650
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:16,272
I need you to deliver a message
from the Phoenix.

651
01:23:18,202 --> 01:23:19,908
You will not ask questions.

652
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:24,659
Do exactly what I say,
and your brother will live.

653
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:27,043
Understand?

654
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:44,224
When you wanted to deliver
something before, where did you go?

655
01:23:49,942 --> 01:23:50,942
Give them this.

656
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:20,343
Is that Gabe?

657
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:21,465
What are you doing here?

658
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:23,237
I got a message
from the Phoenix.

659
01:24:26,228 --> 01:24:27,308
He's inside the van.

660
01:24:49,876 --> 01:24:51,707
Come on, man, move, move!

661
01:25:00,554 --> 01:25:01,669
The door's open.

662
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:03,716
Show him what you showed me.

663
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:15,270
Don't, don't, don't. Don't.

664
01:25:16,153 --> 01:25:17,188
I'm Rafe's brother.

665
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:20,906
Put it down.

666
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,119
Put it down.

667
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:31,285
There's no Rafe here.

668
01:25:31,835 --> 01:25:32,870
What do you want?

669
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:43,760
How'd you know about this?

670
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:47,224
Make the call.

671
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:51,434
Subject moving west.

672
01:25:54,358 --> 01:25:55,814
- Now, boss?
- Not yet.

673
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:05,861
You should've left already.

674
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:09,323
No, our orders are to stay until the end.

675
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:11,864
I think this is the end.

676
01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:13,540
They got him at the bus station.

677
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:14,627
What if we got it wrong?

678
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:19,212
He's asking to be taken to Number One.

679
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:28,130
Says he knows a way into the Closed Zone.

680
01:26:34,815 --> 01:26:35,815
Gabriel?

681
01:26:37,484 --> 01:26:38,564
You know him?

682
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:40,754
He was a student of mine.

683
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:44,400
So, what do we do now?

684
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:47,872
Deliver the message
to Number One.

685
01:26:50,497 --> 01:26:51,987
Subject moving north.

686
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:05,550
Subject traveling.

687
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:11,306
All units, remain out of sight.

688
01:27:32,873 --> 01:27:34,033
It's the Pilsen brothel.

689
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:39,076
Follow her upstairs.

690
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:06,398
Now we go.

691
01:28:08,492 --> 01:28:10,692
- All right!
- Move, move, move!

692
01:28:58,667 --> 01:28:59,747
Hello, Gabriel.

693
01:29:02,796 --> 01:29:03,831
How...

694
01:29:04,297 --> 01:29:05,332
how do you know my name?

695
01:29:07,717 --> 01:29:08,752
Now.

696
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:10,459
- Down! Come on! Don't move!
- Gun!

697
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,441
Stand down until I arrive.

698
01:29:54,764 --> 01:29:55,924
You know this place?

699
01:29:57,017 --> 01:29:58,017
No.

700
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:10,234
Hooker is a history buff.

701
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:30,710
Clip's empty. I don't get it.

702
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:38,682
Huh.

703
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:44,838
Only picture on the wall.

704
01:31:03,249 --> 01:31:04,249
This us?

705
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:46,118
It's her own setup.

706
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:21,233
Communication line
to the Closed Zone is now open.

707
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:33,794
Name, rank, department.

708
01:32:33,882 --> 01:32:35,463
Mulligan, William.

709
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:38,792
Commander. Pilsen Special Branch.

710
01:32:42,348 --> 01:32:44,714
Let's begin the debrief. Proceed.

711
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:49,599
The computer we found contained
all names, aliases and locations

712
01:32:49,689 --> 01:32:51,225
of the Chicago network.

713
01:32:52,025 --> 01:32:55,643
This communication sent
some years before restrictions.

714
01:32:56,488 --> 01:32:58,979
Proof of a national network.

715
01:33:03,453 --> 01:33:05,364
The computer belonged to the prostitute?

716
01:33:05,455 --> 01:33:06,455
Number One.

717
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:09,164
She recorded her interactions
with herjohns

718
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:12,663
and sent relevant information out
through the network's chain.

719
01:33:13,671 --> 01:33:17,630
Her second in command
was Charles Rittenhouse, communications,

720
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:21,756
responsible for activating the operation
known as Phoenix.

721
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:23,173
Go. Get in.

722
01:33:23,515 --> 01:33:26,598
Number three,
Patrick Ellison, operations.

723
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:28,549
- Before demobilization...
- Wait here.

724
01:33:28,645 --> 01:33:30,886
Marine Corps, ordnance.

725
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:34,431
Wait, wait. No. I'm staying with you.
I'm staying with you!

726
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:42,110
Number four, Raul Casi/las,
materials and transport.

727
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,987
Foreman at the Pilsen Auto Yards.

728
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:48,828
Systems analyst Ivan Leviev

729
01:33:48,915 --> 01:33:50,906
hacked into
our central surveillance database

730
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,460
and tracked Deputy Mayor Robert Watts,
the unwitting courier of the bomb.

731
01:33:57,298 --> 01:34:01,041
Harrison Ma, a medical student
before the closures,

732
01:34:01,136 --> 01:34:04,469
developed a procedure
to remove identity implants,

733
01:34:04,556 --> 01:34:08,048
enabling the cell to remain invisible
to tracker drones.

734
01:34:09,102 --> 01:34:12,594
These were the principals
hiding in plain sight

735
01:34:12,689 --> 01:34:15,897
who enabled the cell
to carry out the attack on Soldier Field.

736
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:18,646
The search
for militant suspects has accelerated.

737
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:23,313
An unidentified female resident
is reported to have been shot and killed.

738
01:34:23,408 --> 01:34:25,273
But once we had
their Number One,

739
01:34:25,368 --> 01:34:27,279
they knew we had them, too.

740
01:35:09,412 --> 01:35:10,993
The Chicago network...

741
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:13,867
is neutralized.

742
01:35:26,596 --> 01:35:28,257
What was her name and background?

743
01:35:29,432 --> 01:35:32,640
Her name was Priscilla Scott.

744
01:35:33,436 --> 01:35:36,678
She was a history teacher
at Pilsen Elementary.

745
01:35:37,857 --> 01:35:41,691
She was off the grid for nine years,
so there's nothing else we know about her.

746
01:35:48,034 --> 01:35:49,649
A prostitute. Why?

747
01:35:49,744 --> 01:35:50,744
Access.

748
01:35:51,913 --> 01:35:56,407
She groomed her clients very carefully,
procured members of the Unity government,

749
01:35:56,501 --> 01:36:00,119
and manipulated them
into divulging classified information,

750
01:36:00,213 --> 01:36:04,206
which she recorded
with her concealed wire.

751
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:07,250
Play the tape, please.

752
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:10,789
Can you imagine what they do down there?

753
01:36:11,641 --> 01:36:13,041
Stripping everything.

754
01:36:13,351 --> 01:36:15,512
Every crevasse.
Fracking to the power of ten.

755
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:16,888
Taking it all off planet.

756
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:18,932
You felt those earthquakes.

757
01:36:20,108 --> 01:36:21,788
They'll crawl. They stand.

758
01:36:21,985 --> 01:36:23,025
It's all the same to them.

759
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:25,547
They have this network
of tunnels under the surface...

760
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:27,857
Wait.
You've been inside the Closed Zone?

761
01:36:27,949 --> 01:36:30,315
No, not me. The commissioner.

762
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:32,525
He's the guy with the access.

763
01:36:34,497 --> 01:36:36,897
Well, then we better
get business out of the way.

764
01:36:38,918 --> 01:36:41,125
Yeah, it's a big deal.

765
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:44,044
How often do they come out
of the Closed Zone?

766
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:48,291
Robert Watts,
he's just this alderman's bagman,

767
01:36:48,386 --> 01:36:50,627
but he'll be handling them
out at the rally.

768
01:36:50,722 --> 01:36:52,337
Greeting them, taking them in.

769
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:54,743
That's an incredible responsibility.

770
01:36:54,767 --> 01:36:58,760
Mm-hmm. What if I told you that
the roach governor may be one of them?

771
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:02,187
- Oh...
- Stop the tape, please.

772
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:04,519
Eugene.

773
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:09,399
Our own chain of command was compromised.

774
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:19,281
What about you?

775
01:37:20,752 --> 01:37:21,992
What about me?

776
01:37:26,966 --> 01:37:28,172
You live in this neighborhood.

777
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:30,344
Yes.

778
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:35,012
These are your people.

779
01:37:52,742 --> 01:37:55,279
Evidence will be analyzed
by the Legislature.

780
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:57,281
In the meantime, as acting commissioner,

781
01:37:57,372 --> 01:38:00,114
you are to report to the Closed Zone
for further orders.

782
01:38:00,208 --> 01:38:01,208
No more questions.

783
01:38:13,805 --> 01:38:15,341
Loading up!

784
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:34,818
Lines in a single file.

785
01:39:39,682 --> 01:39:40,682
Rafe's alive.

786
01:39:40,766 --> 01:39:41,846
Yeah, so what?

787
01:39:43,811 --> 01:39:45,122
I don't mean nothing to him anymore.

788
01:39:45,146 --> 01:39:47,228
- You had a purpose.
- There was no purpose.

789
01:39:47,815 --> 01:39:49,021
Rafe's plan failed.

790
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:54,443
What if the plan was to fail?

791
01:40:03,372 --> 01:40:06,739
Like I said, you work for me now.

792
01:40:13,382 --> 01:40:14,982
And what do you want me to do with this?

793
01:40:16,469 --> 01:40:18,801
Did you pay attention
in history class, Gabriel?

794
01:40:23,184 --> 01:40:25,800
Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.

795
01:40:28,731 --> 01:40:29,731
Now, get out.

796
01:40:39,534 --> 01:40:43,322
Commissioner Mulligan.
They made you the big man, Bill.

797
01:40:43,412 --> 01:40:45,949
Look out for us
when you get down there, Commissioner.

798
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:50,080
Here we are.

799
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:53,938
Oh, Lord. Johnny, no.
Well, I'm all sweaty.

800
01:41:54,025 --> 01:41:56,391
- Come on, baby, you look beautiful.
- No...

801
01:42:01,907 --> 01:42:03,467
- Priss, Charles!
- Hi!

802
01:42:03,492 --> 01:42:05,608
Words of advice
from a history teacher

803
01:42:05,703 --> 01:42:07,193
to the future generation?

804
01:42:07,288 --> 01:42:10,576
Hi, baby Gabriel.
I can't wait to cuddle you.

805
01:42:10,666 --> 01:42:12,622
That's not advice.

806
01:42:29,393 --> 01:42:30,929
Bill, how about you?

807
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:33,807
I'm off duty, John.
You got a problem, call 911.

808
01:42:33,898 --> 01:42:35,434
Get up here. You know Priss.

809
01:42:36,025 --> 01:42:37,419
She teaches at the school with my wife.

810
01:42:37,443 --> 01:42:39,024
- Hi. How are you?
- Priss.

811
01:42:39,111 --> 01:42:40,647
Bill, any advice?

812
01:42:40,738 --> 01:42:42,524
Oh, yeah.

813
01:42:42,615 --> 01:42:45,527
Teacher or cop, kid?
You got to make a choice.

814
01:42:45,618 --> 01:42:47,404
Whatever you are, be a good one.

815
01:42:55,753 --> 01:42:57,914
You got
a hell of a family here, kid.

816
01:42:58,005 --> 01:43:01,088
- Thank you.
- And not just them. All of us.

817
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:03,295
Pilsen's got you covered.

818
01:43:03,594 --> 01:43:04,959
The future is yours, kid.

819
01:44:07,867 --> 01:44:09,261
Confirming rank and identity.

820
01:44:09,285 --> 01:44:10,725
Commissioner William Mulligan.

821
01:44:10,786 --> 01:44:12,367
Security clearance complete.

822
01:44:12,913 --> 01:44:13,953
Prepare for descent.

823
01:44:13,998 --> 01:44:16,284
Fifteen seconds.
Guidance is internal.

824
01:44:16,834 --> 01:44:20,543
12, 11, ten, nine...

825
01:44:20,629 --> 01:44:22,995
Ignition sequence start.

826
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:28,210
Six, five, four, three, two, one.

827
01:44:28,304 --> 01:44:29,304
Drop.

828
01:44:31,348 --> 01:44:32,348
Light a match.

829
01:44:33,309 --> 01:44:34,309
Ignite a war.

830
01:44:35,478 --> 01:44:38,720
Long as we fight back, we got a chance.

3
00:01:24,442 --> 00:01:29,046
So, the key for the lock on top
and the one for below.

4
00:01:30,248 --> 00:01:31,750
You're not staying?

5
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:34,654
No, I prefer not to.
Too many memories.

6
00:01:34,655 --> 00:01:37,658
- It's good for you?
- Yeah, of course. I understand.

7
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,762
- See you later.
- Okay.

8
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:29,190
Lewis.

9
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,568
Lewis, is that you?

10
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:41,199
Lewis.

11
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:15,734
Maureen.

12
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:18,938
Maureen.

13
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,354
- I don't know when I fell asleep.
- So...

14
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:41,337
There was a presence.
I felt something... I just can't...

15
00:07:45,412 --> 00:07:47,964
I can't tell, it was too far.

16
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:49,917
You must make contact.

17
00:07:50,619 --> 00:07:52,721
I think there might need to be
two of us for that.

18
00:07:53,322 --> 00:07:56,372
There wasn't enough pull
because I felt something,

19
00:07:56,422 --> 00:07:58,028
it was just keeping its distance.

20
00:08:00,632 --> 00:08:01,733
Come here.

21
00:08:11,644 --> 00:08:12,989
Is it a cross?

22
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,793
Yes.

23
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:17,295
Has that always been there?

24
00:08:28,264 --> 00:08:30,406
She said that she couldn't
make a contact.

25
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:32,708
Does she still feel a presence?

26
00:08:33,249 --> 00:08:35,151
Yes, she says the house is inhabited.

27
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:38,314
Well, we can't buy unless we're sure.

28
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:42,098
We need to know if it's benevolent or not.

29
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:44,520
It's too much of an investment.

30
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,723
Hi, uh... so there...

31
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:50,338
...could be no one... uh...

32
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,430
but there could be something.
I need more time, I think,

33
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:59,435
It's extremely difficult to find
a porthole into the spirit world...

34
00:08:59,436 --> 00:09:00,637
That's just the way that it is.

35
00:09:00,688 --> 00:09:02,438
I was in Stockholm last week...

36
00:09:02,469 --> 00:09:06,543
...and I saw a wonderful exhibition
at the Modern Art Museum.

37
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:10,949
Hilma af Klint,
have you ever heard of her?

38
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:14,253
No.

39
00:09:14,284 --> 00:09:17,357
She said that spirits
commissioned her paintings.

40
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:24,165
She invented abstract art before
Kandinsky and Malevitch in 1906.

41
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:28,264
She claimed that the spirit world
communicated with us...

42
00:09:28,305 --> 00:09:29,766
...through her.

43
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:55,751
"Abstract"

44
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:57,353
"Pioneer"

45
00:09:57,573 --> 00:10:00,876
What fascinated me when I discovered
Hilma af Klint's work was...

46
00:10:01,096 --> 00:10:05,801
that these grand and enigmatic paintings
had been painted in the early 1900's.

47
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:08,704
And that they were made
by a Swedish female artist...

48
00:10:08,735 --> 00:10:11,007
...that I hadn't heard about before.

49
00:10:11,407 --> 00:10:13,909
Maybe the most fascinating part
is that these pieces...

50
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,614
...were made before the conception
of abstract art.

51
00:10:18,454 --> 00:10:21,337
But Hilma af Klint kept her art secret.

52
00:10:22,017 --> 00:10:26,742
She was sure that they wouldn't
be understood during her life.

53
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:32,627
In her will she decided that they would
only be shown 20 years after her death.

54
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:37,913
A hundred years ago Hilma af Klint
painted for the future...

55
00:10:38,353 --> 00:10:40,996
...and the future is here now.

56
00:10:50,006 --> 00:10:51,107
Are you okay?

57
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,200
We didn't bore you too much
at reception?

58
00:10:53,702 --> 00:10:56,151
No, no more than normal.

59
00:10:56,252 --> 00:10:57,654
I lost my passport.

60
00:10:57,655 --> 00:11:00,858
- How long will she be in Vienna for?
- Two days.

61
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:02,557
I put everything on a rack.

62
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,462
You have the leather pants
from the new collection.

63
00:11:08,265 --> 00:11:10,668
They're Kyra's style.
I mean, I can see her in them.

64
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:14,569
Are we able to cut them,
is that possible? They'll be too big.

65
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,472
Let me look into this.

66
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,581
I'll get them for you from the studio.
We're not really supposed to, but...

67
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,703
Please, you bring them back
as soon as you can,

68
00:11:48,724 --> 00:11:50,225
otherwise I'll be in big trouble.

69
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:53,758
Of course. She's going to need something
a little flashier for the AmFAR dinner.

70
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:54,780
Yes.

71
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,786
That's the stuff Louis set aside
for the dinner.

72
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:03,291
If Louis likes it, then she'll love it.

73
00:12:07,796 --> 00:12:09,198
- You like it?
- Hm.

74
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:11,701
So does Louis.
It's no easy to wear.

75
00:12:16,207 --> 00:12:18,909
It's sensual and strong.

76
00:12:20,312 --> 00:12:22,737
I'll take it.
And some boots.

77
00:12:22,738 --> 00:12:23,739
Okay.

78
00:13:07,484 --> 00:13:09,886
Think I'll take both bags...
and this belt.

79
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:13,267
You know her.
I don't want to risk it.

80
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,071
Kyra will want the brown one for sure.

81
00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:18,993
Or the blue, or neither.

82
00:13:20,195 --> 00:13:23,197
Uh... she gave me a blank check.
Do you take deposits?

83
00:13:23,318 --> 00:13:24,379
- Yes.
- Okay

84
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,200
It's 4.500.

85
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:29,684
500 for the belt
and 2.000 for each bag.

86
00:13:29,704 --> 00:13:30,986
Great.

87
00:14:25,862 --> 00:14:28,462
Maureen, I got back but I have
to leave right away.

88
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,565
We'll miss each other.
I'm off to Milan tomorrow morning.

89
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:34,368
I'm leaving an envelope with what
I owe you for the past two weeks.

90
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:35,669
Take care, Kyra.

91
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:39,873
P.S. I left my Mac on the desk.
Can you do the upgrade for me?

92
00:15:42,536 --> 00:15:45,469
Hilma af Klint has moved
in spiritualist circles...

93
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:50,605
...and participated in sיances.
Later she was also a medium.

94
00:15:50,606 --> 00:15:54,710
What actually is regarded
as the essence of spiritualism?

95
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:57,301
Well, the central idea of spiritualism...

96
00:15:57,302 --> 00:16:01,506
...is the idea that there is a world
beyond our world.

97
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:06,159
And spiritualists try to give empirical
proof of this world.

98
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:10,324
In 1848, The Fox sisters heard rappings...

99
00:16:10,355 --> 00:16:15,330
...and they interpreted these rappings
as messages from a deceased person.

100
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:17,032
And that was for them...

101
00:16:17,053 --> 00:16:22,506
...a real proof of the existence
of this higher world beyond our world.

102
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:26,860
It's interesting that the Morse code
had been invented two years earlier.

103
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,485
Spiritualists were always very close
to technological avant-garde.

104
00:16:31,506 --> 00:16:34,428
For example, the first
abstract photographs...

105
00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:37,641
...have been taken by spiritualists.

106
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:41,695
Hilma af Klint believed that she received
the abstract paintings...

107
00:16:41,715 --> 00:16:43,777
... from higher levels of consciousness.

108
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:46,069
When she started to paint as a medium...

109
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:50,403
...she rejected the skills she had learned
at the Art Academy.

110
00:16:50,404 --> 00:16:55,268
And that was due to the influence
of spiritualism and of theosophy.

111
00:16:55,288 --> 00:16:56,910
When you mention theosophy,

112
00:16:56,931 --> 00:17:00,033
what was Rudolph Steiner's
view on abstract art?

113
00:17:00,073 --> 00:17:03,416
Steiner rejected abstract paintings.

114
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:06,120
But that's not the whole story.
A lot of things...

115
00:17:07,623 --> 00:17:10,223
- Hi.
- I'm trying to reach you for a week.

116
00:17:10,244 --> 00:17:13,126
I know. I've been working...
a lot.

117
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:16,230
Okay.
How's it going with Kyra?

118
00:17:16,331 --> 00:17:20,433
I... I never see her.
We leave each other messages.

119
00:17:20,634 --> 00:17:24,137
I hate this job, actually.
I fucking hate her. She sucks.

120
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:26,219
That's not what you said before.

121
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,925
I know, I was just happy to stay
in Paris and pay my rent.

122
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,527
Yeah, but what's changed?

123
00:17:32,628 --> 00:17:36,199
I spend my days doing bullshit
that doesn't interest me...

124
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,952
...and keeps me from what does.
It's driving me fucking crazy.

125
00:17:40,254 --> 00:17:41,555
You should come here.

126
00:17:41,855 --> 00:17:44,757
Yeah, to the Sultanate of Oman.

127
00:17:44,778 --> 00:17:46,220
I'll be here another two months.

128
00:17:47,622 --> 00:17:49,062
I thought you were almost done.

129
00:17:49,063 --> 00:17:52,615
I finished reconfiguring
the Embassy's computer system...

130
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:55,068
...and now I'm just waiting
for the security protocols.

131
00:17:55,269 --> 00:17:57,230
When do you think you'll get those?

132
00:17:57,261 --> 00:17:59,433
It could be tomorrow,
it could be next month.

133
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:03,276
And once I get them I start
to install and configure them.

134
00:18:04,077 --> 00:18:05,778
Come to Muscat.

135
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,523
Look. Came to the seaside
for the weekend.

136
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,989
- Wow.
- It's beautiful.

137
00:18:19,593 --> 00:18:21,545
And what the hell
would I do in Muscat?

138
00:18:21,586 --> 00:18:23,796
What the hell are you doing in Paris?

139
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:29,603
You know... I'm waiting.
I have to wait.

140
00:18:30,405 --> 00:18:32,205
It's been three months.

141
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:39,213
I think I felt something.
I need to go back to Lewis's house.

142
00:18:39,304 --> 00:18:40,815
I really think I felt something.

143
00:18:41,217 --> 00:18:43,419
You think you felt something
or are you sure?

144
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:47,524
I just need to see it
to the end, that's all.

145
00:18:50,228 --> 00:18:52,625
This is perfect.
This works... thank you.

146
00:18:57,231 --> 00:18:59,233
Let's see this.

147
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:02,837
Actually this might be perfect.

148
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,043
I'd like to see them on you.
You don't want to try them on?

149
00:19:08,945 --> 00:19:12,144
I... you know her.
I can't.

150
00:19:12,546 --> 00:19:14,147
But you want to.

151
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:17,650
Sure, if you could keep
your mouth shut maybe.

152
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:19,353
But you totally dicked me over
the last time I did it.

153
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:22,354
Try on the shoes at least.
I'll get them.

154
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,162
They're the same size.
She won't have to send them back.

155
00:19:31,565 --> 00:19:35,869
Okay, Vincent.
You have to promise me...

156
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,570
Not one word.

157
00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:40,072
- Not one word.
- My lips are sealed.

158
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,169
Really? Okay, well, if there's traffic,
there's traffic.

159
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,711
There's nothing you can do about it.

160
00:20:18,732 --> 00:20:22,414
They'll wait. They just need
a little daylight, it's okay.

161
00:20:23,016 --> 00:20:25,367
No, I can't wait. I have an appointment.

162
00:20:25,388 --> 00:20:27,719
I'll meet you at your place
later this afternoon.

163
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:29,924
Okay.

164
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,998
The leather pants.
They're great, right?

165
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:37,003
No, not these. You can't keep...
I promised...

166
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,731
I promised that I'd bring them
back in the morning.

167
00:20:39,752 --> 00:20:41,934
Please don't do that to me. I...

168
00:20:44,537 --> 00:20:47,340
I'm telling them right now.
It's no problem, don't worry. Okay.

169
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,484
Hey, so she is on her way. She's late.
Her plane from Milan was just delayed.

170
00:20:52,505 --> 00:20:53,506
But where is she?

171
00:20:53,527 --> 00:20:55,869
She's on the highway.
Just traffic apparently.

172
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,650
Can you stand in for her?
It will save us some time.

173
00:20:59,452 --> 00:21:02,554
- I have to leave at 4 o'clock.
- Yes, it's okay.

174
00:21:02,557 --> 00:21:04,457
Good, perfect. Come.

175
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:08,260
- You think she'll ditch everything?
- Yeah, she'll ditch everything.

176
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:11,964
- I brought you three options, so...
- And with that we'll make it through?

177
00:21:12,366 --> 00:21:14,866
I... can't make any promises.

178
00:21:15,068 --> 00:21:17,570
I'd feel more comfortable
if you stayed.

179
00:21:19,173 --> 00:21:22,676
- You scared of Kyra?
- I hear she's a monster.

180
00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:24,179
Okay.

181
00:21:25,381 --> 00:21:26,278
Great.

182
00:21:29,882 --> 00:21:31,883
This is your left ventricle.

183
00:21:32,185 --> 00:21:34,787
It's just slightly larger in size.

184
00:21:34,788 --> 00:21:37,289
It was exactly the same
for your twin brother.

185
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:41,624
You can live with it and die at 100.

186
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,627
Or at 27.

187
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:46,268
I treated Lewis
just like I'm treating you.

188
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:50,101
An ultrasound twice a year.
There was no sign, nothing.

189
00:21:50,132 --> 00:21:52,004
One day it just gave way.

190
00:21:53,196 --> 00:21:56,308
Don't be scared, Maureen. What happened
to Lewis was very exceptional.

191
00:21:58,411 --> 00:21:59,911
You can get up.

192
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:13,905
Everything is fine.

193
00:22:13,925 --> 00:22:16,728
You just need to keep avoiding
both intense physical efforts...

194
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:18,731
...and extreme emotions.

195
00:22:18,752 --> 00:22:20,734
Like Lewis did.

196
00:22:20,735 --> 00:22:24,539
- I mean... he built cabinets.
- I know.

197
00:22:27,743 --> 00:22:30,141
You know, he wanted to turn
that house into a...

198
00:22:30,242 --> 00:22:33,845
...a studio where he could teach
and just practice carpentry.

199
00:22:34,747 --> 00:22:37,349
He really considered it his future.

200
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:40,652
I'll see you again in six months.

201
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,353
I have no idea where
I'm going to be in six months.

202
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,261
Good evening, Maureen.

203
00:22:49,163 --> 00:22:52,567
Excuse me, we haven't met.
I'm Ingo.

204
00:22:52,568 --> 00:22:56,772
Hi. Sorry, is Kyra here?

205
00:22:56,773 --> 00:23:00,972
In her room with her lawyer. They've been
on a conference call for an hour.

206
00:23:01,371 --> 00:23:03,275
Problems with the Foundation.

207
00:23:03,777 --> 00:23:06,878
I'm just here to pick up
a few things. She was aware.

208
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,182
- Do you know where they are?
- There's one garment bag over there.

209
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:24,896
Um... just a random question,

210
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:27,949
but did you happen to know about
two pairs of leather pants?

211
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,500
They should be in the bags.

212
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:33,204
- She wants to keep them.
- Oh.

213
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,308
Okay.

214
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:39,011
She's just in there?

215
00:23:42,115 --> 00:23:45,716
Oh, she's uh... She's a real fucking
pain in the ass, right?

216
00:23:54,425 --> 00:23:56,928
We've been working on this
for six months.

217
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:59,830
We can't just call off the press trip
at the last minute.

218
00:23:59,831 --> 00:24:00,983
Hey, Kyra.

219
00:24:00,984 --> 00:24:03,384
We have a three-year-old gorilla
who's been gone for three weeks...

220
00:24:03,385 --> 00:24:05,386
and now we have a problem
with the whole family.

221
00:24:05,407 --> 00:24:08,199
Mrs. Gellman's husband invests
a lot of time and money...

222
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,703
...in gorilla habitat preservation.
He cares deeply about gorillas.

223
00:24:11,704 --> 00:24:15,146
But if things go wrong, this reflects
really badly on his business interests.

224
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:16,848
I just want to ask you one question.

225
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:18,749
This is serious.
You need to take care of it.

226
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,052
- Hello!
- The female is depressive.

227
00:24:21,053 --> 00:24:24,355
The male Ngabo, you've dealt with him,
is becoming aggressive.

228
00:24:24,376 --> 00:24:27,078
Ngabo can become very aggressive
in stressful situations.

229
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:29,340
- I remember very well, thank you.
- Hey, Kyra...

230
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,861
Where are they now,
where are the gorillas?

231
00:24:30,882 --> 00:24:35,196
Well, they wander off farther
and farther into the mountain.

232
00:24:35,217 --> 00:24:38,949
- And it's difficult to monitor them.
- We can't cancel the reporters.

233
00:24:38,969 --> 00:24:40,851
We have contractual obligations.

234
00:24:40,852 --> 00:24:43,304
- We need those gorillas to be there.
- Just one quick question.

235
00:24:44,806 --> 00:24:47,378
I'm hearing problems
but I'm not hearing solutions.

236
00:24:54,185 --> 00:24:55,586
Do you mind if I smoke?

237
00:25:01,493 --> 00:25:03,594
You have nothing to do
besides dresscue her?

238
00:25:03,595 --> 00:25:06,096
Really find it worthy of your time?

239
00:25:06,498 --> 00:25:10,101
Um... do you have a better offer?

240
00:25:10,132 --> 00:25:11,604
Not exactly, but...

241
00:25:12,205 --> 00:25:14,455
I'm a correspondent
for men's Vogue in Berlin.

242
00:25:14,476 --> 00:25:16,006
I can put a word in for you.

243
00:25:16,027 --> 00:25:17,708
Thank you.

244
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,811
But, you know, magazines
aren't really my thing.

245
00:25:22,113 --> 00:25:24,315
They sell shit and...

246
00:25:25,418 --> 00:25:28,419
mainly for advertisers rather than readers.

247
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,321
So what? You already have
a stupid job.

248
00:25:31,362 --> 00:25:34,626
It wouldn't change a thing
and the pay is better.

249
00:25:38,731 --> 00:25:39,832
Not for me.

250
00:25:41,635 --> 00:25:45,135
Some highly regarded photographers
publish in fashion magazines.

251
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:48,204
- Are they free?
- I suppose so.

252
00:25:48,205 --> 00:25:52,710
Yeah? They get to choose the brands
and the subjects they shoot?

253
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:54,893
No, that is correct.

254
00:25:54,894 --> 00:25:56,896
I don't really see the freedom in that.

255
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:02,502
I'm gonna go.
I'll take the dress and the bags.

256
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:06,156
You really need to tell her
she's got to return those pants.

257
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:07,959
I'll call and come back tomorrow.

258
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,962
Do you know if she'll be here tomorrow?

259
00:26:13,266 --> 00:26:15,766
Just ask her.

260
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:17,869
She told me to leave.

261
00:26:20,472 --> 00:26:22,124
And you're not leaving.

262
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:25,228
I'm waiting for her to finish.
I want to speak with her.

263
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:26,831
She wants to dump me.

264
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:30,335
How long has it been?

265
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:33,339
Two years.

266
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,387
But she's scared her husband
will find out.

267
00:26:37,688 --> 00:26:40,090
I'm sure he suspects something.

268
00:26:40,121 --> 00:26:43,194
- Are you in love with her?
- Love?

269
00:26:44,296 --> 00:26:46,496
It never crossed my mind, no...

270
00:26:46,587 --> 00:26:48,900
It's just physical.

271
00:26:50,202 --> 00:26:52,102
What are you doing in Paris?

272
00:26:53,603 --> 00:26:56,007
I'm... waiting.

273
00:26:57,009 --> 00:26:58,410
I'm gonna go.

274
00:26:59,112 --> 00:27:01,011
What are you waiting for?

275
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:08,118
My uh... brother died here.

276
00:27:08,499 --> 00:27:11,521
My twin brother died in Paris.

277
00:27:12,622 --> 00:27:14,725
- Accident?
- No.

278
00:27:17,229 --> 00:27:18,630
A heart attack.

279
00:27:21,634 --> 00:27:25,435
I actually have the same malformation.

280
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:31,241
- Does it scare you?
- No.

281
00:27:31,262 --> 00:27:32,842
And It didn't scare him.

282
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:36,147
You're going to stay here
to mourn him.

283
00:27:36,645 --> 00:27:39,149
No, I'm waiting,
I told you I was waiting.

284
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,451
What are you waiting for?

285
00:27:44,855 --> 00:27:46,757
So we made this oath...

286
00:27:50,662 --> 00:27:53,164
...that whoever died first
would send the other a sign.

287
00:27:54,467 --> 00:27:55,768
A sign?

288
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,972
From... from the afterlife?

289
00:27:59,674 --> 00:28:02,171
You could call it that,
you could call it a million things.

290
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:05,725
But how do you know if it's a sign?

291
00:28:06,527 --> 00:28:08,378
I'm a medium.

292
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:10,781
He was... he was a medium.

293
00:28:12,784 --> 00:28:14,484
I'll just know it.

294
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:20,491
Have you communicated with spirits before?

295
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:24,395
Um... Lewis thought there were spirits.
I'm less sure.

296
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:26,899
But... yes.

297
00:28:28,301 --> 00:28:30,904
Uh... somewhat.

298
00:28:32,907 --> 00:28:38,808
There are invisible presences
around us...

299
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:40,009
...always.

300
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,952
Whether or not they're the souls
of the dead, I don't know but...

301
00:28:44,284 --> 00:28:46,766
I mean, when you're a medium
you just sort of attune...

302
00:28:46,787 --> 00:28:48,268
...to a sort of uh...

303
00:28:49,871 --> 00:28:52,173
...vibe.

304
00:28:52,374 --> 00:28:54,877
What do you mean by vibe?

305
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,228
It's an intuition thing...
it's a feeling you...

306
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,932
You see this door...

307
00:29:02,634 --> 00:29:05,436
...it's only like slightly ajar.

308
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:08,040
I also think that.

309
00:29:09,442 --> 00:29:10,543
The soul...

310
00:29:10,739 --> 00:29:13,447
...continues to exist after death.

311
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:16,251
I don't even know if I believe in that.

312
00:29:17,553 --> 00:29:20,356
But Lewis did.

313
00:29:20,657 --> 00:29:22,199
And uh...

314
00:29:23,101 --> 00:29:28,257
I have to give his spirit,
or whatever you want to call it...

315
00:29:28,358 --> 00:29:29,959
...a chance to prove him right.

316
00:29:32,362 --> 00:29:35,865
- Until when?
- I had a sign.

317
00:29:35,966 --> 00:29:38,168
- Ah, yeah?
- Yeah.

318
00:29:38,766 --> 00:29:40,369
Are you sure?

319
00:29:40,971 --> 00:29:42,771
No. That's why I'm still waiting.

320
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,976
And then?

321
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:54,185
And then, I guess I'll live my life and...

322
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:55,787
...let it go.

323
00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:50,839
I'll come for you in the morning.

324
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,742
Or before. Call when you want.

325
00:30:52,763 --> 00:30:53,944
Okay.

326
00:30:54,346 --> 00:30:56,448
Hey!
And thank you.

327
00:31:03,211 --> 00:31:05,634
So we thought about it,
and we're renovating.

328
00:31:05,654 --> 00:31:08,237
I think that's what Lewis
would've wanted.

329
00:31:08,857 --> 00:31:11,480
I just wanted Maureen to be
at peace with this place.

330
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,382
And with Lewis's spirit.

331
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,453
I... I just wanted to say...

332
00:31:24,893 --> 00:31:28,797
Lewis would have been very happy
that this house is in your hands and...

333
00:31:29,317 --> 00:31:31,560
...that I'm very glad too.

334
00:31:32,541 --> 00:31:36,084
Now, it's your house...

335
00:31:37,205 --> 00:31:39,087
...and I'll forget it.

336
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:03,571
Come on.

337
00:34:17,145 --> 00:34:18,547
I need more from you.

338
00:34:19,549 --> 00:34:21,651
I'm gonna need more from you.

339
00:34:52,482 --> 00:34:54,484
Give me one more sign.

340
00:34:54,986 --> 00:34:56,688
Anything.

341
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:03,996
Give me the tiniest thing.

342
00:35:06,499 --> 00:35:08,802
Is that it?
Is that it?

343
00:35:13,307 --> 00:35:15,609
Is it to tell me
that there's no afterlife?

344
00:35:19,114 --> 00:35:22,017
Is it to tell me you can see me,
you just cannot talk to me?

345
00:35:27,623 --> 00:35:30,467
Because I don't care what you do
with the fucking plumbing.

346
00:35:30,487 --> 00:35:32,319
I need you to fucking talk to me.

347
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:35,633
Please, I don't understand.

348
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:52,551
I know my brother.

349
00:35:55,255 --> 00:35:57,143
And you're not my brother.

350
00:36:01,148 --> 00:36:02,699
You're not.

351
00:36:17,115 --> 00:36:18,916
Oh shit!

352
00:40:29,366 --> 00:40:36,273
Ladies and gentlemen, train 9040,
departing to London at 9:35...

353
00:40:36,274 --> 00:40:39,978
...is now ready for boarding.
Platform 10.

354
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,041
Thank you.

355
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:52,531
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

356
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:31,070
I prepared everything Kyra asked for.

357
00:45:31,172 --> 00:45:32,966
Two dresses she picked
from the photograph...

358
00:45:32,987 --> 00:45:35,669
...and a furred one that didn't
photograph so well...

359
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:36,871
...but I think she'll like it.

360
00:45:36,892 --> 00:45:37,973
Which one?

361
00:45:38,074 --> 00:45:39,523
This one there.

362
00:45:40,825 --> 00:45:42,926
It's silk organza.

363
00:45:42,927 --> 00:45:45,330
In the photo you kind of lose
some of the sheen but...

364
00:45:45,351 --> 00:45:47,232
...it really plays well with the light.

365
00:45:47,324 --> 00:45:49,633
Oh, yes, it's cool.

366
00:45:50,435 --> 00:45:51,536
It's really cool.

367
00:45:51,627 --> 00:45:53,839
The harness comes in
in different colors as well.

368
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,739
- Can I see them?
- Yeah.

369
00:45:57,542 --> 00:46:00,545
There you go.
We've got gold, black and nude.

370
00:46:00,566 --> 00:46:01,567
Black.

371
00:46:01,588 --> 00:46:04,247
It's not for all tastes
but I think it'll look amazing on Kyra.

372
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:07,352
Do you want to try it?

373
00:46:09,054 --> 00:46:10,255
Come.

374
00:46:27,774 --> 00:46:29,275
Just a moment.

375
00:47:07,214 --> 00:47:08,816
Do you want to try the dress?

376
00:47:09,813 --> 00:47:10,819
No.

377
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,122
Well, I'll take it in two colors
so she has the option.

378
00:47:13,143 --> 00:47:15,819
Cool. I'll get it all
packed up for you.

379
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:08,221
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,

380
00:48:08,242 --> 00:48:13,627
we wish to inform you that train
9022, 14:20 departure to Paris...

381
00:48:13,648 --> 00:48:17,031
...is now ready for boarding
at platform 5.

382
00:49:48,623 --> 00:49:51,225
- Maureen.
- Oh, Kyra... I'm on...

383
00:49:52,474 --> 00:49:54,229
I'm on the train to Paris.

384
00:49:56,532 --> 00:49:58,534
I'll drop the stuff off this evening.

385
00:49:59,336 --> 00:50:00,582
When do you get back?

386
00:50:04,487 --> 00:50:09,591
Even if it's early afternoon, it's okay.
It'll be ready for you in a garment bag.

387
00:50:10,193 --> 00:50:13,296
I have to pick up the jewelry from Cartier.
But everything else is ready.

388
00:50:17,101 --> 00:50:21,305
I would prefer it in euros
if that's not a problem.

389
00:50:21,336 --> 00:50:24,409
You could ask your driver to stop
at an ATM on the way back from CDT...

390
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:25,912
It'll take two seconds.

391
00:50:32,819 --> 00:50:35,822
It was 400.
We agreed on 400.

392
00:50:38,026 --> 00:50:41,023
There are a couple
of taxi receipts as well.

393
00:50:45,628 --> 00:50:47,230
See you tomorrow.

394
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:39,981
Ladies and gentlemen, we will soon
be arriving at our final destination.

395
00:51:40,032 --> 00:51:45,588
Please check all your luggage
before leaving the train.

396
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:49,092
Mind the gap.

397
01:01:20,161 --> 01:01:21,162
Hi.

398
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:24,867
How are you?

399
01:01:24,908 --> 01:01:27,265
You're sure the spirit
is not there anymore.

400
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:28,267
Yes.

401
01:01:28,368 --> 01:01:31,071
She vomited this ectoplasm...

402
01:01:31,573 --> 01:01:32,874
...and left.

403
01:01:33,375 --> 01:01:37,676
The ectoplasm lingered for a minute
or less and then also just disappeared.

404
01:01:38,377 --> 01:01:40,680
Do you have any idea
what she wanted?

405
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:44,084
She was really angry, and very violent.

406
01:01:45,286 --> 01:01:46,885
Maybe she had a score to settle.

407
01:01:47,586 --> 01:01:49,188
I think she was lost.

408
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:54,392
I don't think she wants to come back.
I don't think she'll be there again.

409
01:02:00,199 --> 01:02:01,700
And what about Lewis?

410
01:02:03,702 --> 01:02:05,805
It's been ninety-five days.

411
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:12,510
Jיrפme and Cassandre are going
to buy the house.

412
01:02:16,615 --> 01:02:17,817
Good.

413
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:26,226
Lewis really loved them,
so that's perfect.

414
01:02:28,729 --> 01:02:30,131
What about you?

415
01:02:35,037 --> 01:02:36,634
What will you do with the money?

416
01:02:36,835 --> 01:02:38,237
Nothing.

417
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:40,738
Nothing?

418
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:43,042
I don't know.

419
01:02:43,543 --> 01:02:45,946
I'm not sure I can buy something else.

420
01:02:46,247 --> 01:02:48,746
I'm not confident enough
about the future.

421
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:53,052
Let me show you.

422
01:02:54,154 --> 01:02:56,356
I don't think you understand.

423
01:02:57,458 --> 01:03:00,558
I definitely understand.
Trust me.

424
01:03:06,565 --> 01:03:08,467
Uh... I met someone.

425
01:03:09,068 --> 01:03:12,270
That's like you... oh.

426
01:03:14,473 --> 01:03:15,574
Well...

427
01:03:18,077 --> 01:03:20,077
You must have known him before.

428
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:22,781
Kind of uh...

429
01:03:23,483 --> 01:03:25,585
...a friend of a friend.

430
01:03:30,891 --> 01:03:33,344
After Lewis died
he reached out to me and...

431
01:03:33,345 --> 01:03:35,793
we grew... we grew closer.

432
01:03:40,198 --> 01:03:41,799
You're shocked.

433
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,403
No! Good.
I wasn't...

434
01:03:44,804 --> 01:03:47,805
I wasn't expecting it but...
of course.

435
01:03:47,908 --> 01:03:52,212
I will always love Lewis but I can't
spend my life in mourning.

436
01:03:53,214 --> 01:03:57,314
I'm not interested in mourning.
Suffering and pain are hard enough.

437
01:04:00,619 --> 01:04:03,321
And I think now I want life.

438
01:04:31,551 --> 01:04:34,451
The other day you said
Victor Hugo actually, you know,

439
01:04:34,472 --> 01:04:36,984
he said that he communicated with spirits.
But what do you mean by that?

440
01:04:37,005 --> 01:04:38,726
- Like actually talk to them?
- Yes,

441
01:04:38,756 --> 01:04:41,759
...when he was in exile in Jersey
he turned tables...

442
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:45,864
...he conversed with famous
historical figures...

443
01:04:45,865 --> 01:04:48,467
...like, even biblical ones...

444
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:50,167
It's pretty out there.

445
01:04:50,188 --> 01:04:51,368
How?

446
01:04:51,389 --> 01:04:55,674
How?
I don't really know.

447
01:04:55,695 --> 01:04:58,878
No, I mean, literally.
Verbally, or with an alphabet?

448
01:04:58,899 --> 01:05:02,282
Ah, not the alphabet.
They tried but the spirit refused.

449
01:05:03,885 --> 01:05:05,086
So what did he do?

450
01:05:05,087 --> 01:05:07,089
With a pedestal table...

451
01:05:07,090 --> 01:05:10,693
...the leg would tap on the floor, like...
once for yes, twice for no.

452
01:05:11,215 --> 01:05:13,890
Like one for a, two for b,

453
01:05:13,891 --> 01:05:16,393
and so on, like 26 for z.

454
01:05:16,484 --> 01:05:19,026
Well, that would take an unbelievable
amount of time.

455
01:05:19,047 --> 01:05:21,899
Yeah, there are pages and pages
of transcriptions.

456
01:05:23,501 --> 01:05:25,652
But, dude, it's got to be bullshit.
It's invented.

457
01:05:25,673 --> 01:05:27,905
- I don't know.
- There's no way that happened.

458
01:05:27,926 --> 01:05:29,407
No, he really believed it.

459
01:05:29,428 --> 01:05:32,709
And it wasn't intended for publication,
so why make it up?

460
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:36,614
I think that whoever did the transcripts
must have adapted them,

461
01:05:36,635 --> 01:05:37,915
filled in the gaps.

462
01:05:37,936 --> 01:05:41,648
- Sounds like stenography, kind of.
- Yes, that's a good analogy.

463
01:05:41,669 --> 01:05:44,921
But if you're interested,
there's a TV movie from the '60s...

464
01:05:44,942 --> 01:05:46,323
...that depicts the sיance.

465
01:05:47,045 --> 01:05:50,128
It's really tacky but seems accurate.

466
01:05:50,429 --> 01:05:53,520
I'll find the title for you but...
if you type in, like,

467
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:57,474
Hugo + Jersey + turning tables
on YouTube, you'll find it.

468
01:06:02,939 --> 01:06:04,241
- Crazy dog!
- So long.

469
01:06:05,243 --> 01:06:08,145
Quiet, sit!

470
01:06:11,988 --> 01:06:14,371
"Victor Hugo in Jersey"

471
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:27,344
The being called the white lady asked me
on the first day a thing that I did.

472
01:06:28,345 --> 01:06:32,749
I know that a being,
afraid of coming, ran away.

473
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:35,932
Is there someone here?

474
01:06:37,173 --> 01:06:38,655
If yes, knock once...

475
01:06:39,576 --> 01:06:41,197
if no, knock twice.

476
01:06:47,143 --> 01:06:49,806
Before I ask you who you are,
I'll ask you a question.

477
01:06:51,087 --> 01:06:54,871
But first, this question:
do you see it in my thoughts?

478
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:02,038
Do you want to answer it?

479
01:07:06,963 --> 01:07:07,924
Then talk.

480
01:07:25,221 --> 01:07:26,863
The mountain is my grave.

481
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:29,826
I'm God's breath, I go up and down,

482
01:07:29,857 --> 01:07:32,528
I want the sky and the earth wants me.

483
01:07:32,989 --> 01:07:34,460
The stars pull me by my hair...

484
01:07:34,481 --> 01:07:36,764
...and the nails of the coffin
hold me by my feet.

485
01:07:37,513 --> 01:07:41,557
The darkness screams to me: "Down!"
and the suns say "Up!".

486
01:07:42,178 --> 01:07:44,020
I'm the uncomforted of the horizon.

487
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:48,564
I'm the night watcher of countless graves,
emptying his eyes in empty skulls.

488
01:07:49,025 --> 01:07:51,327
I'm the cause of bad dreams.

489
01:08:05,743 --> 01:08:09,246
I want you to see us clearly,
and no longer in the shadows.

490
01:08:09,247 --> 01:08:11,367
Is that two sides of one same face?

491
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:22,560
I'm everywhere but I'm only seen
at certain hours.

492
01:08:22,561 --> 01:08:26,966
I get up and go to bed.
Souls have laws just like the stars.

493
01:08:26,982 --> 01:08:28,969
They exist like planets.

494
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:32,088
There are stabile souls
and wandering souls.

495
01:08:32,089 --> 01:08:35,492
The sky has two aspects:
the sun and the souls.

496
01:08:35,893 --> 01:08:38,496
Night and death are but a resurrection.

497
01:08:38,797 --> 01:08:41,097
Half of the night is eternity...

498
01:08:41,698 --> 01:08:44,501
the other half is immensity.

499
01:10:48,235 --> 01:10:49,324
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

500
01:10:49,344 --> 01:10:52,941
I need to know what name
room 724 was booked under?

501
01:10:53,532 --> 01:10:55,150
Okay, just a second.

502
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:56,861
724...

503
01:10:58,821 --> 01:10:59,905
It was...

504
01:11:01,074 --> 01:11:03,117
Maureen Cartwright, I have.

505
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:08,081
No, I'm Maureen Cartwright.
Who paid for the room?

506
01:11:08,247 --> 01:11:09,415
Just a sec.

507
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:14,571
I'm sorry, there is no credit
card information.

508
01:11:14,589 --> 01:11:16,251
It was paid in advance in cash.

509
01:11:17,756 --> 01:11:19,592
Do you remember if it was
a man or a woman?

510
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,469
I don't know. I was not working
at that moment.

511
01:11:21,636 --> 01:11:23,304
Would you ask a colleague?
Do you know...?

512
01:11:23,471 --> 01:11:25,140
It's a big hotel.

513
01:11:25,474 --> 01:11:27,309
I'm not sure I can
help you with that.

514
01:11:38,047 --> 01:11:39,846
Thank you. See you later.

515
01:11:53,296 --> 01:11:56,005
These are the five pieces
of your selection.

516
01:11:56,172 --> 01:12:00,009
And particularly the "Pont des Arts" clasp,
of the "Paris Nouvelle Vague" collection.

517
01:12:00,259 --> 01:12:03,263
Made of 18-carat rose gold
and fine stones.

518
01:12:03,348 --> 01:12:04,751
C'est bien. Yes, it's perfect.

519
01:12:04,752 --> 01:12:06,646
The necklace, the bracelet,
the ring and the watch,

520
01:12:06,849 --> 01:12:09,204
but excluding this.
I've never seen that.

521
01:12:09,234 --> 01:12:11,563
Okay. All right, then we focus
on these four.

522
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:13,063
- Okay.
- I'll prepare them for you then.

523
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:14,724
- Merci.
- You're welcome.

524
01:12:17,944 --> 01:12:20,253
And this one is brand new,
first time released.

525
01:12:20,254 --> 01:12:21,608
So no one has it.

526
01:12:21,616 --> 01:12:24,534
Oh, good. That's important.
Thank you.

527
01:13:05,701 --> 01:13:07,036
Hey, Kyra, you back?

528
01:13:12,626 --> 01:13:16,088
Sorry, I let myself in. I'm just gonna
drop these bags for you, okay?

529
01:13:34,823 --> 01:13:36,600
Hey Kyra, you doing all right?

530
01:13:46,045 --> 01:13:47,045
Hey?

531
01:13:54,754 --> 01:13:55,955
Hey... hey.

532
01:16:12,894 --> 01:16:14,187
Follow me, please.

533
01:16:21,486 --> 01:16:23,364
I drove for...

534
01:16:24,782 --> 01:16:27,201
2 minutes maybe before
I realized what I was doing,

535
01:16:27,367 --> 01:16:29,494
and I came back and called.

536
01:16:30,663 --> 01:16:32,957
Why didn't you do it earlier?

537
01:16:35,885 --> 01:16:37,550
I fr...

538
01:16:37,852 --> 01:16:41,074
I freaked... out. I...

539
01:16:42,216 --> 01:16:44,252
I... I... I ran away.

540
01:16:44,928 --> 01:16:47,346
You ran away from a presence.

541
01:16:49,766 --> 01:16:51,642
There was a light on in the...

542
01:16:53,729 --> 01:16:57,115
...back of the apartment,
I heard something. Yeah.

543
01:16:57,357 --> 01:17:00,068
What were you doing at Mrs. Gellman's?

544
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:02,529
Dropping off a couple of bags.

545
01:17:03,948 --> 01:17:05,364
I don't understand.

546
01:17:06,157 --> 01:17:08,452
I'm a personal shopper.
You know, she was...

547
01:17:09,453 --> 01:17:11,580
...very high profile and couldn't...

548
01:17:12,415 --> 01:17:14,928
...do normal things,
didn't have the time and...

549
01:17:14,958 --> 01:17:17,745
...I sort of assisted her in that.

550
01:17:24,552 --> 01:17:27,722
You used Mrs. Gellman's computer
last night.

551
01:17:28,514 --> 01:17:29,473
Um, maybe.

552
01:17:29,639 --> 01:17:31,184
And again this morning.

553
01:17:32,227 --> 01:17:35,230
You check your messages on Gmail.

554
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:37,940
We have the record.

555
01:17:40,402 --> 01:17:41,736
So, why are you asking?

556
01:17:42,112 --> 01:17:43,863
Did you sleep at her place?

557
01:17:46,886 --> 01:17:47,886
Did you sleep at her place?

558
01:17:47,909 --> 01:17:49,494
Yes, I did. I slept at her place.

559
01:17:49,661 --> 01:17:50,620
Why?

560
01:17:53,324 --> 01:17:54,747
Um, I...

561
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:57,419
I don't know.

562
01:17:57,919 --> 01:18:00,046
I... to be honest, I never do that.

563
01:18:00,214 --> 01:18:01,715
Why did you hide it?

564
01:18:03,301 --> 01:18:04,802
A stupid reaction.

565
01:18:06,052 --> 01:18:07,638
Maybe, maybe I was...

566
01:18:08,514 --> 01:18:09,807
...a little ashamed.

567
01:18:13,894 --> 01:18:16,647
You knew she was coming home today?

568
01:18:16,814 --> 01:18:19,024
Yeah. She was coming back from Milan,

569
01:18:19,192 --> 01:18:20,943
and on her way to Marrakech.

570
01:18:22,152 --> 01:18:25,072
I was dropping off some
accessories for her.

571
01:18:25,573 --> 01:18:27,033
What accessories?

572
01:18:27,817 --> 01:18:29,035
Jewelry.

573
01:18:29,911 --> 01:18:31,121
What jewelry?

574
01:18:32,956 --> 01:18:35,958
Very expensive jewelry from Cartier.

575
01:18:37,378 --> 01:18:38,878
And you left it there?

576
01:18:41,005 --> 01:18:44,385
Yeah. In four cases in two bags.

577
01:18:45,051 --> 01:18:46,762
Were they still there
when you went back?

578
01:18:47,779 --> 01:18:49,556
I... I... I don't know. I wasn't...

579
01:18:49,723 --> 01:18:52,517
...I wasn't considering the jewelry
at that point...

580
01:18:52,934 --> 01:18:54,395
I didn't notice.

581
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,530
Sorry, if I woke you up.

582
01:19:45,788 --> 01:19:49,075
No... I was just stress-testing...

583
01:19:49,617 --> 01:19:51,745
...one of the new security protocols.

584
01:19:51,913 --> 01:19:53,956
They're really fucking hard
to configure.

585
01:19:54,023 --> 01:19:55,707
So, it's gonna take me a month.

586
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:57,666
Best case.

587
01:19:58,753 --> 01:20:00,212
I'm gonna come see you.

588
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:04,424
You giving up?

589
01:20:06,344 --> 01:20:07,720
Yeah, it's not going to happen.

590
01:20:09,122 --> 01:20:11,884
Maureen, it's not that
it isn't going to happen,

591
01:20:11,924 --> 01:20:14,019
it's that it doesn't exist.

592
01:20:14,519 --> 01:20:15,895
After death,

593
01:20:16,562 --> 01:20:17,813
there's nothing.

594
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:18,940
I- I know.

595
01:20:20,442 --> 01:20:22,152
And it's not that big a deal.

596
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:24,988
You told me that you had a hope.

597
01:20:25,447 --> 01:20:27,157
Like you really hoped that...

598
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:28,534
Of course I do.

599
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:31,285
But, no.

600
01:20:32,037 --> 01:20:33,371
I don't believe.

601
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:37,209
I don't want to be here anymore.

602
01:20:37,377 --> 01:20:39,503
I don't want to be in Paris anymore.

603
01:20:41,463 --> 01:20:42,548
I miss you.

604
01:20:43,173 --> 01:20:44,757
I miss you too.

605
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:47,561
And um...

606
01:20:47,803 --> 01:20:50,639
I'm actually heading up
the mountains for a few days.

607
01:20:50,847 --> 01:20:53,893
If you want to, you can come quickly
and meet me there.

608
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,104
Maybe... It really...

609
01:20:56,645 --> 01:20:58,480
...depends on what the police say.

610
01:20:58,530 --> 01:21:00,607
If the travel ban's been lifted or not.

611
01:21:00,774 --> 01:21:02,901
- The police?
- Yeah.

612
01:21:04,279 --> 01:21:06,438
Kyra was murdered,
you didn't hear that? It's everywhere.

613
01:21:06,469 --> 01:21:08,290
- What?
- It's all over the news.

614
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:09,840
- I found her.
- Murdered?

615
01:21:10,201 --> 01:21:12,644
- Who murdered her?
- I don't know.

616
01:21:14,706 --> 01:21:17,000
It was really horr... It was, uh...

617
01:21:19,085 --> 01:21:20,169
Are you okay?

618
01:21:22,130 --> 01:21:25,259
I can't talk about it.
It was fucking horrible.

619
01:21:29,136 --> 01:21:31,599
Do you want me
to call you back later?

620
01:21:32,016 --> 01:21:33,191
I'll call you.

621
01:26:31,656 --> 01:26:33,741
- You okay?
- Yeah.

622
01:26:43,336 --> 01:26:46,297
- They... Can I have some of this?
- Yeah, sure.

623
01:26:50,428 --> 01:26:52,138
They arrested Ingo, and he...

624
01:26:52,971 --> 01:26:55,474
...he confessed to everything.

625
01:26:57,351 --> 01:26:59,269
Did they lift the travel ban?

626
01:27:00,229 --> 01:27:01,772
Yeah. The case is closed.

627
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,275
But you'll testify?

628
01:27:08,404 --> 01:27:09,738
Yes, probably.

629
01:27:12,991 --> 01:27:14,702
Do you want to come to my place?

630
01:27:16,119 --> 01:27:17,455
Yeah. I feel, um...

631
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:20,999
I'm scared when I alone now.

632
01:27:22,043 --> 01:27:23,753
You're going to see Gary, right?

633
01:27:24,548 --> 01:27:26,547
Yes, Yep.

634
01:27:29,343 --> 01:27:31,176
You should have gone a while ago.

635
01:27:31,886 --> 01:27:33,323
I should have listened to you.

636
01:27:35,181 --> 01:27:36,933
Let's go, I have my car.

637
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:07,640
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

638
01:28:14,346 --> 01:28:15,723
You're Lewis's sister.

639
01:28:19,101 --> 01:28:20,270
I am.

640
01:28:20,812 --> 01:28:22,647
We were together at l'ֹcole Boulle.

641
01:28:23,063 --> 01:28:25,735
Now I work at the Gobelin workshops.

642
01:28:27,777 --> 01:28:29,696
Actually, I should get going soon.

643
01:28:30,655 --> 01:28:31,781
You should stay.

644
01:28:32,699 --> 01:28:33,700
If you can.

645
01:28:35,077 --> 01:28:36,494
- Maureen.
- Erwin.

646
01:28:36,662 --> 01:28:37,829
Nice to meet you.

647
01:28:43,251 --> 01:28:45,545
I understand that you might
feel uncomfortable.

648
01:28:47,297 --> 01:28:48,174
Why?

649
01:28:48,841 --> 01:28:51,593
Because I've taken Lewis's place.

650
01:28:51,927 --> 01:28:53,095
So soon.

651
01:28:53,262 --> 01:28:54,388
Not at all.

652
01:28:55,222 --> 01:28:56,390
You're mistaken.

653
01:28:58,808 --> 01:29:02,687
While he was alive,
there was nothing between Lara and me.

654
01:29:03,731 --> 01:29:06,524
It didn't cross my mind.
Honestly.

655
01:29:08,778 --> 01:29:12,822
You know how they say
the dead watch over the living?

656
01:29:14,158 --> 01:29:15,784
I've thought about that a lot.

657
01:29:16,495 --> 01:29:19,205
Not just because Lewis was a medium.

658
01:29:19,956 --> 01:29:21,707
I don't know what that means.

659
01:29:23,793 --> 01:29:27,797
For me, he was someone
deeply intuitive of others.

660
01:29:27,828 --> 01:29:29,200
He, uh...

661
01:29:29,967 --> 01:29:32,677
...understood things that went unspoken.

662
01:29:33,552 --> 01:29:34,553
He did.

663
01:29:36,057 --> 01:29:39,059
Maybe because he knew
he was going to die.

664
01:29:39,975 --> 01:29:44,065
I mean, I felt that he
saw things which I didn't.

665
01:29:46,984 --> 01:29:48,319
Maybe you do too.

666
01:29:49,319 --> 01:29:51,780
He thought you had the same gifts.

667
01:29:52,489 --> 01:29:53,615
I don't know.

668
01:29:54,743 --> 01:29:56,222
I, uh...

669
01:29:56,923 --> 01:29:58,806
...had a tendency to follow him.

670
01:30:00,248 --> 01:30:02,292
He took things quite far.

671
01:30:03,168 --> 01:30:05,336
Too far for me, at least.

672
01:30:05,711 --> 01:30:07,088
I couldn't keep up.

673
01:30:08,005 --> 01:30:10,258
All I mean is that with Lewis,

674
01:30:11,092 --> 01:30:12,802
nothing seems impossible.

675
01:30:14,887 --> 01:30:18,475
Many religions believe that
the soul wanders around for a while...

676
01:30:18,642 --> 01:30:20,352
...before leaving this world.

677
01:30:20,893 --> 01:30:22,563
Did he speak to you about that?

678
01:30:22,729 --> 01:30:24,273
He was convinced of it.

679
01:30:32,446 --> 01:30:34,658
You know, right after our mum died,

680
01:30:34,991 --> 01:30:36,535
he was sure that...

681
01:30:37,870 --> 01:30:42,124
...he was visited by her.
That she came to say goodbye to him.

682
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:46,253
That it felt like a dream,
but not, that it was very real.

683
01:30:46,420 --> 01:30:49,840
He could smell her,
he could see her so clearly... you know.

684
01:30:50,757 --> 01:30:51,967
Do you believe that?

685
01:30:52,635 --> 01:30:53,845
Yeah, I do.

686
01:30:55,096 --> 01:30:57,973
It's not a religion thing, but I...

687
01:30:59,099 --> 01:31:00,226
I do.

688
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:02,854
Do you think Lewis is here?

689
01:31:06,859 --> 01:31:08,837
Well, I...

690
01:31:11,403 --> 01:31:12,488
I don't think so.

691
01:31:16,327 --> 01:31:17,994
I feel his presence.

692
01:31:19,287 --> 01:31:20,246
He's here.

693
01:31:23,167 --> 01:31:25,628
That might be your guilt talking.

694
01:31:25,794 --> 01:31:28,129
You don't need to feel guilty.

695
01:31:29,422 --> 01:31:32,300
Lara deserves to be happy.

696
01:31:32,635 --> 01:31:33,886
And you do too.

697
01:31:34,678 --> 01:31:36,388
I'd like to think so but...

698
01:31:37,848 --> 01:31:39,350
...something is stopping me.

699
01:31:40,184 --> 01:31:43,003
- I hope it has nothing to do with me.
- No.

700
01:31:46,733 --> 01:31:49,193
But you also have to
free yourself of Lewis.

701
01:31:50,361 --> 01:31:52,197
Well, I wish he'd let me.

702
01:31:53,073 --> 01:31:56,159
Wherever he is,
he would never forbid it.

703
01:31:57,869 --> 01:32:00,163
And even if he's nowhere,

704
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:02,499
hold on to the memory
of his freedom.

705
01:32:03,916 --> 01:32:05,293
Put it into practice.

706
01:32:08,297 --> 01:32:09,498
I know...

707
01:32:15,844 --> 01:32:17,513
I know what you mean.

708
01:32:18,764 --> 01:32:20,475
You know, I have to get going.

709
01:32:22,769 --> 01:32:24,604
Will you be staying a few days?

710
01:32:25,522 --> 01:32:27,607
Just tonight. I leave tomorrow.

711
01:32:28,066 --> 01:32:30,651
- So, I'll see you tonight.
- Okay

712
01:33:44,455 --> 01:33:46,981
Uh-uh-uh! Stand still!
Good boy.

713
01:33:52,319 --> 01:33:53,571
What happened?

714
01:33:54,030 --> 01:33:55,198
A glass broke.

715
01:33:55,574 --> 01:33:57,159
I thought you were outside?

716
01:33:57,325 --> 01:33:58,659
Erwin just left.

717
01:33:58,826 --> 01:34:00,787
He probably left it at the end
of the table, or something.

718
01:35:04,768 --> 01:35:06,896
I hope you had a good trip.

719
01:35:07,064 --> 01:35:08,441
Get some rest.

720
01:35:09,191 --> 01:35:11,235
Your driver is named Salim.

721
01:35:11,610 --> 01:35:14,112
It's best to leave a little
before daybreak.

722
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:16,866
Count on a five hour ride
and don't worry.

723
01:35:17,032 --> 01:35:20,077
The road is safe,
even if it's not very busy.

724
01:35:20,452 --> 01:35:23,289
Take the minimum.
I have everything we need.

725
01:35:23,456 --> 01:35:25,166
In other words, not much.

726
01:35:25,541 --> 01:35:28,628
If it's okay with you,
we'll stay for a week.

727
01:35:29,204 --> 01:35:32,090
You'll have to be tolerant,
it's Spartan.

728
01:35:32,315 --> 01:35:34,676
But you told me
this is what you wanted.

729
01:37:12,443 --> 01:37:13,643
Haiji?

730
01:37:41,807 --> 01:37:42,725
Lewis?

731
01:37:51,859 --> 01:37:52,985
Are you here?

732
01:38:05,748 --> 01:38:07,249
Have you been waiting for me?

733
01:38:30,231 --> 01:38:31,567
Are you at peace?

734
01:38:45,914 --> 01:38:46,957
Thank you.

735
01:39:08,479 --> 01:39:10,022
Are you not at peace?

736
01:39:25,538 --> 01:39:26,915
Are you playing with me?

737
01:39:36,550 --> 01:39:38,217
Do you mean harm?

738
01:39:45,768 --> 01:39:47,144
I don't know you.

739
01:39:56,987 --> 01:39:58,196
Who are you?

740
01:40:00,951 --> 01:40:02,159
Who are you?

741
01:40:17,341 --> 01:40:18,719
Lewis, is it you?

742
01:40:20,011 --> 01:40:21,597
Lewis, is it you?

743
01:40:35,152 --> 01:40:36,696
Or is it just me?

744
01:40:37,305 --> 01:41:37,551

00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,553
<i>Wakey Wakey. Heads up!</i>

3
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:47,474
<i>Shoes, pants...
Low bridge! Shirt...</i>

4
00:01:47,766 --> 00:01:50,435
<i>On your left. I'll take that.</i>

5
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:56,441
<i>Block slap. Knife switch.</i>

6
00:01:56,734 --> 00:01:58,694
<i>Grip 'im, flip 'im.</i>

7
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,823
<i>Okay. Coffee, anyone?</i>

8
00:02:03,281 --> 00:02:05,701
<i>Can you imagine
waking up every day,</i>

9
00:02:05,743 --> 00:02:08,120
<i>with some random asshole
like Mr Good Morning here,</i>

10
00:02:08,203 --> 00:02:10,817
<i>trying to hack you up
with a fucking machete.</i>

11
00:02:11,456 --> 00:02:12,457
<i>Seriously.</i>

12
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,167
<i>This might have
been fun for a while.</i>

13
00:02:17,676 --> 00:02:18,714
<i>You're fuckin' dead!</i>

14
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:22,467
<i>Once the shock wore off,</i>

15
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,707
<i>once I realised what
the hell was happening,</i>

16
00:02:25,387 --> 00:02:27,723
<i>after nearly a
hundred and forty times</i>

17
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:29,725
<i>it just fuckin' got annoying.</i>

18
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:31,977
<i>And I want it to stop.</i>

19
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:34,354
<i>But I know it won't.</i>

20
00:02:35,605 --> 00:02:38,776
<i>You know how people say: "Oh, I
can do that with my eyes closed",</i>

21
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:41,344
<i>and you always think they
sound like assholes, but...</i>

22
00:02:42,236 --> 00:02:43,236
<i>Whatever.</i>

23
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,584
<i>Watch.</i>

24
00:02:50,662 --> 00:02:52,998
Sorry, pal! They
think you're me!

25
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:06,136
<i>As many times as I've seen this happen to
my apartment, I still can't help but think:</i>

26
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:09,014
<i>"Fuck, man, this is a lease..."</i>

27
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,475
<i>"The landlord is already
an asshole, anyway, and..."</i>

28
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:15,478
<i>"...I'm never ever getting
my security deposit back."</i>

29
00:03:32,788 --> 00:03:34,289
<i>It wasn't always like this.</i>

30
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,793
<i>I was happy once. I really was.</i>

31
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,796
<i>I had a woman
that I loved, but...</i>

32
00:03:42,172 --> 00:03:44,382
<i>now I'm just pissed off.</i>

33
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:05,695
<i>Ah, shit. Gotta jump.</i>

34
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,335
<i>I missed this truck
exactly 22 times before.</i>

35
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:24,047
<i>Know how it feels, falling
four storeys to the street below?</i>

36
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,054
<i>It fuckin' hurts
is how it feels.</i>

37
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:47,821
<i>Mr Man's Man in the Challenger here screams
at date-rape volume every single time:</i>

38
00:04:47,863 --> 00:04:51,491
- I'M BEING CAR-JACKED!!
- Yes, you are.

39
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,829
<i>The next set of assholes trying
to kill me are in that minivan.</i>

40
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:57,556
Could you get through
this traffic, please?

41
00:04:57,568 --> 00:04:58,474
Don't tell me how to drive.

42
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:59,900
I'm not telling
you how to drive.

43
00:04:59,912 --> 00:05:02,133
<i>Esmeralda the chauffeur and Pam.</i>
- You love to argue.

44
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,309
<i>I have no fuckin' idea if
those are their real names,</i>

45
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,923
<i>because I never
stop to say hello.</i>

46
00:05:35,994 --> 00:05:39,194
<i>Now, after the bus it's pretty
much smooth sailing and I can...</i>

47
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,542
<i>Wait a second, did I... Oh
shit, did I get to the bus yet?</i>

48
00:05:45,003 --> 00:05:46,004
<i>Nope</i>

49
00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:48,966
God?

50
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,262
<i>Don't feel bad for me.</i>

51
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:59,184
<i>This kinda shit
happens eeevery day.</i>

52
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:02,187
<i>I used to complain that
every day it felt the same.</i>

53
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,844
<i>And then May 9th came.</i>

54
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:06,316
<i>And now every day <b>is</b> the same.</i>

55
00:06:13,198 --> 00:06:16,784
<i>Same wake-up scream, same
machete-wielding asshole.</i>

56
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,970
<i>Same everything,
with... slight variations.</i>

57
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:23,000
Motherf...!!

58
00:06:23,768 --> 00:06:24,965
Argh!

59
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:32,926
<i>One thing that never changes...</i>

60
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:36,679
<i>is I die.</i>

61
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,474
<i>Every. Single. Day.</i>

62
00:06:41,643 --> 00:06:42,644
<i>I die.</i>

63
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:44,938
<i>Here's a little highlight reel.</i>

64
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:49,359
<i>Now, truth be told,</i>

65
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:51,069
<i>I don't even know
why they want to kill me</i>

66
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:54,072
<i>or what I've done to deserve getting
killed, but there's a shit-ton of 'em.</i>

67
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:55,615
<i>You've met Pam.</i>

68
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:00,578
<i>She did that to me 14 times
before I finally got the timing down.</i>

69
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:07,460
<i>This little angel-faced
asshole is known as Guan-Jin.</i>

70
00:07:09,837 --> 00:07:11,464
<i>How do I know her name?</i>

71
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:13,967
I am Guan-Jin!

72
00:07:14,842 --> 00:07:16,386
And Guan-Jin has done this.

73
00:07:16,428 --> 00:07:18,513
<i>Her name means
"Goddess of Mercy".</i>

74
00:07:18,596 --> 00:07:19,889
<i>I think she digs irony.</i>

75
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:27,147
<i>I call this little cocky
motherfucker Kaboom.</i>

76
00:07:28,856 --> 00:07:30,305
<i>What's up, pretty boy?</i>

77
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,884
You fuckin' weird old
dwarf, what are you doing?

78
00:07:33,027 --> 00:07:34,027
Oh.

79
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,364
I don't like <b>that</b> attitude.

80
00:07:38,075 --> 00:07:40,368
<i>I gave them all
nicknames: Pam, Smiley,</i>

81
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,495
<i>the German twins, Roy number 2,</i>

82
00:07:42,537 --> 00:07:46,041
<i>who just happens to be some
asshole who looks exactly like me.</i>

83
00:07:48,085 --> 00:07:50,045
<i>And sometimes I
manage to kill them.</i>

84
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,258
<i>But it doesn't matter.</i>

85
00:07:56,051 --> 00:07:57,455
<i>They always find me.</i>

86
00:07:58,424 --> 00:08:00,222
<i>And eventually,
they take me out.</i>

87
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:01,681
I'm Guan-Jin!

88
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,769
And Guan-Jin has done this!

89
00:08:04,894 --> 00:08:08,215
<i>I don't know how this is possible, or
why I keep repeating the same day.</i>

90
00:08:08,293 --> 00:08:09,964
<i>I've never had
time to figure it out</i>

91
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:12,670
<i>It's a shit show from the
second I open my eyes.</i>

92
00:08:15,237 --> 00:08:16,237
<i>Jemma.</i>

93
00:08:16,982 --> 00:08:18,424
<i>The only woman I've ever loved,</i>

94
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,201
<i>and the one person who has
the answers I'm looking for.</i>

95
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:29,417
- Hello?
- Uh... I'm looking for Dr. Jemma Wells.

96
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:30,460
<i>Who's this?</i>

97
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:33,827
This is her husb...
um, her boyfriend, Roy.

98
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:37,841
Ah, Captain Roy Pulver
here, of Delta Force fame.

99
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,386
Who's this?

100
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:43,681
- This is Colonel Clive Ventor.
<i>- Jemma's boss.</i>

101
00:08:44,015 --> 00:08:46,393
- Until recently.
- Is she around?

102
00:08:47,282 --> 00:08:51,231
<i>- Well no, unfortunately she's not.</i>
- Do you know when she'll be back?

103
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:56,444
Now that is more of a cosmic question that
I'd have to hand over to a higher power.

104
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:58,912
- Huh?
<i>- She's dead.</i>

105
00:09:01,038 --> 00:09:02,038
- What?

106
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,704
<i>I hate to be the bearer
of bad news, but...</i>

107
00:09:05,537 --> 00:09:08,456
Miss Wells took a nasty spill
and snapped her neck last night.

108
00:09:09,564 --> 00:09:11,159
<i>An accident in the lab.</i>

109
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:13,961
<i>Working late,
likely very fatigued.</i>

110
00:09:14,045 --> 00:09:15,046
No...

111
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,884
Can I ask where you are?

112
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:25,973
- Ein.
- Zwei.

113
00:09:26,308 --> 00:09:27,850
<i>That was no fucking accident.</i>

114
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,291
[both] Drei!

115
00:09:32,564 --> 00:09:34,857
<i>Why is she dead? Who killed her?</i>

116
00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:37,777
<i>I've never lived long
enough to find out.</i>

117
00:09:37,902 --> 00:09:41,008
<i>Okay so, where were
we? Oh yeah, the bus.</i>

118
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
Fuck!

119
00:10:07,996 --> 00:10:11,172
- [speaks Spanish]
- Oh, honey, we've got ourselves a cowboy.

120
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:13,315
<i>I think I'm gonna have
to get serious here.</i>

121
00:10:17,234 --> 00:10:18,234
<i>What the f...!</i>

122
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:21,278
<i>Fuck me!!</i>

123
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,610
OHH!!

124
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:30,659
Fuck!

125
00:11:27,762 --> 00:11:29,514
<i>Nah, I think they deserved it.</i>

126
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,998
- Hey, Roy.
- Hi, Jake.

127
00:11:46,364 --> 00:11:50,493
You look like death taking a
dump. What happened to you?

128
00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:52,579
I just woke up
wrong. I'm fine, Jake.

129
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,791
It happens all the time. Can I get
a large bottle of that Baijiu, please?

130
00:11:58,228 --> 00:12:00,980
You know what, Jake?
Make it two large bottles.

131
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:02,922
Two! Jesus Christ!

132
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:09,227
Hear ye, hear ye! Sir
Osis of Liver. I'm kidding.

133
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:11,978
Alcoholics
unanimous, am I right?

134
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:16,528
- You know you got today, right Jake?
- Because tomorrow isn't guaranteed.

135
00:12:16,598 --> 00:12:19,188
Fuckin' A, pal. Fuckin' A.

136
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:22,745
This kids is all
about to shut down.

137
00:12:22,854 --> 00:12:24,278
How can you drink like that?

138
00:12:28,865 --> 00:12:30,825
- How can you not?
- You know,

139
00:12:31,228 --> 00:12:35,766
a lot of expert internal security
pundits, and mind you, I'm one of 'em,

140
00:12:36,627 --> 00:12:39,292
think that next 9/11 will
target our distilled spirits.

141
00:12:39,474 --> 00:12:41,753
Now, you have got a country
where the rate of alcoholism

142
00:12:41,815 --> 00:12:44,158
and binge drinking is
somewhere in the 38th percentile

143
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,257
so should you wipe out...

144
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,134
<i>This douchebag's named Dave.</i>

145
00:12:48,475 --> 00:12:51,566
<i>Dave is a security specialist
at some private firm,</i>

146
00:12:51,644 --> 00:12:55,944
<i>and it doesn't matter what my answer is to
him asking "how can you drink like that?"</i>

147
00:12:56,017 --> 00:12:59,601
<i>he always launches into this
exact same fucking speech.</i>

148
00:13:00,552 --> 00:13:03,816
<i>I know what he's gonna
say... word for word.</i>

149
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:07,612
<i>I know everything that's gonna
happen from the second I walk in.</i>

150
00:13:08,195 --> 00:13:11,281
<i>At 11:05, this famous
Chinese swordfighter comes in.</i>

151
00:13:11,368 --> 00:13:13,217
<i>She was a twelve-time
world champion.</i>

152
00:13:13,374 --> 00:13:14,744
Shhit! Dai Feng.

153
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:17,342
<i>Why, you know she's
one of the most famous...</i>

154
00:13:17,354 --> 00:13:18,781
<i>Woman Chinese sword masters?</i>

155
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,875
- Twelve times...
- World Champion.

156
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,578
- Have I told you about her?
- A hundred times.

157
00:13:23,782 --> 00:13:25,422
Really? I don't remember.

158
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:29,156
- I do.
- Pedro, clear a table for Si-Fu Feng.

159
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,594
Hi. Please, sit.

160
00:13:31,761 --> 00:13:36,349
<i>Si-Fu Feng here, is the reason I have to
bust my ass to get to the bar every day.</i>

161
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:39,894
<i>If I get here any later than eleven,
she takes the last seat at the bar.</i>

162
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:46,408
Shit. She just stared at me.

163
00:13:47,068 --> 00:13:49,542
- Have you ever been with a woman?
- Excuse me?

164
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,411
Have you ever been with a woman?

165
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:56,435
I think I'm... <i>catching a
fish, if you know what I mean.</i>

166
00:13:56,774 --> 00:14:00,528
I think you have a better chance of
growing a penis on your forehead, Jake.

167
00:14:03,835 --> 00:14:05,252
<i>At around noon...</i>

168
00:14:05,336 --> 00:14:09,248
<i>O- okay. I feel-I feel a little
bit bad about this next thing.</i>

169
00:14:11,843 --> 00:14:14,411
<i>I just love seeing him
wipe out, I'm sorry.</i>

170
00:14:14,504 --> 00:14:17,098
<i>I know I should probably warn
him, but it's just so fuckin' funny</i>

171
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:19,642
<i>and it's not like I got a lot
to laugh about these days.</i>

172
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:23,671
You can't file workman's comp.
Pedro, no one will believe you.

173
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,525
<i>At 12:20, Dave the Pant
Loaf finally goes back to work.</i>

174
00:14:27,942 --> 00:14:30,115
You better hope the
terrorists don't decide to

175
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,715
start poisoning the
world's Baijiu supply, Roy.

176
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:35,757
But not before delivering
that little gut-buster.

177
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,288
- That's too much.
- Sit down, Dave.

178
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,179
Excuse me?

179
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,503
I want to tell you a story.

180
00:14:46,544 --> 00:14:50,831
<i>Okay, I'm bombed today.
A little twist on the war story.</i>

181
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:54,802
<i>I start talking about the other times
I've died, when I've had too much to drink.</i>

182
00:14:54,844 --> 00:14:57,221
Have you ever been
shot in the face, Dave?

183
00:15:00,224 --> 00:15:01,733
I was shot in the face.

184
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,438
A funny thing happened
to me right before I died.

185
00:15:06,147 --> 00:15:08,190
This was a while back now, it...

186
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:11,110
It was a .45 ACP round.

187
00:15:13,571 --> 00:15:15,948
Enters here. Clean.

188
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,797
Bullet winds up in my
mouth, almost intact.

189
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,079
And I remember... tasting steak.

190
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:26,876
Yeah. Like a
really-really good rib-eye.

191
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:32,715
And it wasn't only until-until
much later, when I was alive again,

192
00:15:33,841 --> 00:15:34,842
I said, "Shit...

193
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:40,210
that was my tongue, being
cooked by the heat of the bullet."

194
00:15:40,698 --> 00:15:42,607
That's what I tasted. My tongue.

195
00:15:43,154 --> 00:15:45,883
Can you believe that
shit? That's fuckin' wild.

196
00:15:49,524 --> 00:15:51,776
That is a true story, Dave.

197
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,794
Good stuff, buddy.

198
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,547
<i>Ever thought about
getting a sober coach?</i>

199
00:16:13,631 --> 00:16:14,632
Copy that.

200
00:16:16,297 --> 00:16:18,831
<i>At exactly 12:47... oh, well,</i>

201
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,387
<i>let me get to that in a second.</i>

202
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:25,557
<i>Let's say a quarter 'til, I've usually
got a really, really good buzz,</i>

203
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,854
<i>and I-I'm feeling fuckin' good.</i>

204
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,404
<i>You see, as long as
I make it to this bar,</i>

205
00:16:32,496 --> 00:16:34,498
<i>I can drink 'til they find me.</i>

206
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,333
<i>I can get abso-lutely
shit-faced.</i>

207
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:44,078
<i>And not feel a thing.</i>

208
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:52,587
<i>12:47 PM. I've never, not once
made it, a minute past this point.</i>

209
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:57,383
<i>Why do I let it happen?</i>

210
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:58,930
<i>Why not?</i>

211
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,456
<i>Because outside this bar,
no matter what direction I run</i>

212
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:06,337
<i>and no matter how hard I fight, I
have never lived past 12:47 PM.</i>

213
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,352
<i>They.Always. Get me.</i>

214
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,442
<i>A bunch of assholes
I've never met,</i>

215
00:17:11,466 --> 00:17:13,815
<i>killing me for reasons
that remain a mystery.</i>

216
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,826
<i>And she's dead. My girl.</i>

217
00:17:25,134 --> 00:17:27,997
<i>Gone in a moment further
back than I can ever go.</i>

218
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:32,126
<i>Stuck here in the death
loop of a never-ending day.</i>

219
00:17:33,056 --> 00:17:36,255
<i>I know I can't keep...
drinking my way through it.</i>

220
00:17:37,571 --> 00:17:39,634
<i>Not when every
day ends like this.</i>

221
00:17:40,505 --> 00:17:44,219
<i>I need a plan now. I need
to make somebody pay.</i>

222
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:48,034
<i>They have an army.
All I have is time.</i>

223
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:51,031
<i>Yesterday... was months ago.</i>

224
00:18:07,739 --> 00:18:08,739
Great.

225
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,416
Yeah, that's good.

226
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:26,784
Guys, um... can you
give me a second, please?

227
00:18:26,796 --> 00:18:27,223
Sure.

228
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:32,937
My God, woman.

229
00:18:35,356 --> 00:18:36,357
Look at you.

230
00:18:39,944 --> 00:18:41,612
- Hey.
- Hey.

231
00:18:47,118 --> 00:18:51,522
So... have you developed some
allergic reaction to the phones?

232
00:18:51,706 --> 00:18:55,785
No, no, I just got back. My cell phone
is shut off and I didn't get a chance to...

233
00:18:56,043 --> 00:18:57,672
square away my landline, so...

234
00:18:57,735 --> 00:19:00,256
- So they shut that off, too?
- Ah, yeah.

235
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:04,222
I mean, it's-it's really just luck
that you got in touch with me at all.

236
00:19:04,246 --> 00:19:05,246
Ah, yeah.

237
00:19:06,597 --> 00:19:08,287
The amount of luck
it took to find you

238
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:10,677
in the bar at the bottom
of your apartment building.

239
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,631
What would be odds?

240
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,231
Well hello there, sarcasm.
How you been, stranger?

241
00:19:17,314 --> 00:19:19,441
Haven't heard
from you in a while.

242
00:19:20,735 --> 00:19:22,987
- What's that?
- I brought a resume.

243
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:28,236
But the printer I used
was kinda low on ink

244
00:19:28,248 --> 00:19:30,810
so the Delta Force
section is hard to read.

245
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:35,416
That gonna hurt my chances?

246
00:19:41,293 --> 00:19:42,293
Come here.

247
00:19:43,758 --> 00:19:45,062
They, um...

248
00:19:45,597 --> 00:19:46,939
wear uniforms here.

249
00:19:46,963 --> 00:19:49,148
- So I just...
- Ah. Alright, cool, yeah.

250
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,101
- I need to just...
- I mean, it's not those... whoa!

251
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,561
Those maroon things, like mall
security, because I can't rock them...

252
00:19:55,905 --> 00:19:58,701
Maroon. Like...

253
00:19:59,119 --> 00:19:59,681
my dress?

254
00:19:59,729 --> 00:20:03,143
No, not like your dress,
because that would be sexy.

255
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,497
- That's...
- No, I'm just saying.

256
00:20:04,521 --> 00:20:06,439
- Fine.
<i>- A-anyway, I...</i>

257
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:08,864
What's the salary here, anyway?

258
00:20:08,989 --> 00:20:10,845
<i>Have you an idea? And
is there a medical co-pay</i>

259
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:14,115
<i>because I have pre-existing...
You know, with the... combat stuff.</i>

260
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:17,541
<i>Anyway, what are you doing
here? It looks really... big.</i>

261
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,072
- Been working on it a while?
- Just long enough, I hope.

262
00:20:22,492 --> 00:20:24,048
What is that thing, anyway.

263
00:20:24,131 --> 00:20:28,886
That's five years worth of sleepless
nights and round-the-clock research.

264
00:20:29,636 --> 00:20:32,473
And it means more to me
than you can possibly imagine.

265
00:20:32,514 --> 00:20:35,517
- What does it do?
- What's it do?

266
00:20:35,977 --> 00:20:38,729
Unmakes all of time and space.

267
00:20:39,143 --> 00:20:43,546
And destroys the planet in its
entirety, if... improperly used.

268
00:20:44,273 --> 00:20:45,305
No shit?

269
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:48,572
<i>Wait, like "Doomsday" destroy?</i>

270
00:20:50,634 --> 00:20:52,284
<i>Well, you must
be really stressed.</i>

271
00:20:57,874 --> 00:20:59,486
Wow, look at Joe.

272
00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:02,962
Jesus, he's getting
so big, Jemma.

273
00:21:04,387 --> 00:21:06,715
Hey, you mind
if I swap this out?

274
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:12,221
This-this picture, you've...
got another one of these?

275
00:21:12,728 --> 00:21:15,247
Oh yeah, sure, you can
take it. What's your weight?

276
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:22,648
I'm doing, um... I'm doing a
special paleo thing, so it's like 175.

277
00:21:23,024 --> 00:21:24,406
Still drinking?

278
00:21:24,944 --> 00:21:27,010
- Yeah...
- I'll put 180.

279
00:21:30,031 --> 00:21:31,866
Have you thought
about telling 'im?

280
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,245
It would mean a lot to me
if we could tell him, Jemma.

281
00:21:38,414 --> 00:21:42,126
Honestly, what would he gain?
You've been absent for most of his life.

282
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,745
Why do you say
it like that, like...

283
00:21:46,121 --> 00:21:48,331
it wouldn't be worth it if
I got to know him now.

284
00:21:50,511 --> 00:21:52,474
My work took me
away from you, guys.

285
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:53,741
- Your work?
- Yeah

286
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:55,201
Your work?

287
00:21:55,226 --> 00:22:00,139
I... You loved that life a lot more than
you loved the idea of sharing one with us.

288
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,479
Getting shot at is way more
exciting than diapers and minivans.

289
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,164
Right right right, there's your
go-to argument and you know that.

290
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:11,311
I'm just... asshole who didn't
want to stick around, right?

291
00:22:11,488 --> 00:22:13,500
What does it matter
any more, Roy?

292
00:22:13,991 --> 00:22:17,927
We-we both moved on, we've made
our decision, and Joe adores you anyway.

293
00:22:18,287 --> 00:22:20,064
- He adores me?
- Yeah.

294
00:22:21,498 --> 00:22:23,042
What'd he say about me?

295
00:22:29,256 --> 00:22:30,883
What do you want, Roy?

296
00:22:33,677 --> 00:22:35,972
I lost you. Okay?

297
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:40,434
I know that I blew it. I
made my peace with it.

298
00:22:42,644 --> 00:22:44,897
Please don't let that
happen with my son.

299
00:22:45,751 --> 00:22:46,773
That's all I'm asking.

300
00:22:48,943 --> 00:22:51,070
He's our boy, Jemma.

301
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,782
<i>- Doctor Wells.</i>
- Just a minute.

302
00:22:55,824 --> 00:22:57,534
Oh, sorry, Brett.

303
00:22:58,035 --> 00:22:59,741
This is Roy. Roy, Brett.

304
00:22:59,835 --> 00:23:01,947
Brett's head of
security here at Dynow.

305
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,708
Your office is in a
restricted area, Dr. Wells

306
00:23:04,932 --> 00:23:07,842
- And is therefore off limits.
- I made it clear to the Colonel

307
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,459
that I would accept visitors
when I deemed it appropriate.

308
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:15,158
I was... just dropping off my
resume, big guy. It's all good.

309
00:23:18,889 --> 00:23:20,891
Well, we're not
hiring right now.

310
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:23,810
- Captain... Pulver.
- Tell him I'll be there in a moment.

311
00:23:25,687 --> 00:23:27,050
The Colonel's waiting.

312
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,819
What a dick.

313
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,871
- I thought you said you were hiring.
- They are. We are.

314
00:23:41,635 --> 00:23:42,792
I am...

315
00:23:44,081 --> 00:23:46,042
What are you talking about?

316
00:23:46,874 --> 00:23:49,643
It's a very specific
security detail.

317
00:23:49,836 --> 00:23:51,880
Black bag stuff, like covert?

318
00:23:52,372 --> 00:23:54,633
- Beyond.
<i>- Really?</i>

319
00:23:55,926 --> 00:23:57,136
When do I start?

320
00:23:58,694 --> 00:24:00,306
Sooner than you think.

321
00:24:01,152 --> 00:24:05,102
I read the man's resume...
and I see cause for concern.

322
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,645
He doesn't look like much.

323
00:24:07,629 --> 00:24:12,484
No one ever notices the housefly until
he fucks up a good bowl of soup, Brett.

324
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,155
There's something I
don't like about him.

325
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:19,533
He has that... trait.

326
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:22,262
What trait is that?

327
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:26,915
The overachiever who makes
up for a lack of talent with hustle.

328
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:30,044
<i>The guy on the
playground I grew up hating.</i>

329
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:34,798
<i>Vet his service history.</i> If it's accurate,
I want him tracked and monitored.

330
00:24:35,466 --> 00:24:38,552
If he becomes problematic,
we'll deal with him.

331
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:42,556
And, um... reach
outside the normal ranks.

332
00:24:43,543 --> 00:24:47,040
No one that could connect back to us.
The more random the assets, the better.

333
00:24:47,094 --> 00:24:49,021
Find some real freaks.

334
00:24:49,731 --> 00:24:53,167
Okay, I'm gonna get out of here,
grab a little vino, maybe some...

335
00:24:53,245 --> 00:24:55,005
- Just let me fix your hair.
- Ow, ow, Jemma!

336
00:24:58,577 --> 00:24:59,656
I'm bleeding.

337
00:25:00,241 --> 00:25:02,804
- Did you get my birthday present, Roy?
- What are you doing here?

338
00:25:02,828 --> 00:25:03,856
You're acting so weird.

339
00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:05,864
Did you get it? The
present. I sent it to you.

340
00:25:05,942 --> 00:25:07,354
I don't know, I haven't checked.

341
00:25:07,366 --> 00:25:09,208
Well, please do. I
sent it a few days ago.

342
00:25:10,527 --> 00:25:11,960
I will. Of course I will.

343
00:25:12,607 --> 00:25:15,250
<i>Dr. Wells, could I
see you for a moment.</i>

344
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:21,303
- Go to the hospital, first.
- Be there in a moment, Colonel.

345
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,890
- You drew blood.
- Listen to me now, Roy.

346
00:25:25,474 --> 00:25:28,394
Okay look, I know we haven't
seen much of each other lately

347
00:25:28,435 --> 00:25:30,345
and I know we've gone
down very different paths.

348
00:25:30,408 --> 00:25:31,116
I know, but when I...

349
00:25:31,128 --> 00:25:32,568
It's important that
you listen. Just listen!

350
00:25:32,592 --> 00:25:34,955
- Alright, you talk. You talk, you talk.
- Okay.

351
00:25:35,042 --> 00:25:36,860
I forgot how trying this can be.

352
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:43,200
I see a lot of
you. In Joe, I do.

353
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:47,371
His determination, his willingness
to succeed no matter what.

354
00:25:47,538 --> 00:25:51,583
He has some of your best qualities,
but he also has your selfishness

355
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,134
and your ability to just...
disappear when it suits him.

356
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,884
Just when I thought we
were turning a corner.

357
00:25:56,896 --> 00:25:57,966
And run from responsibility.

358
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,967
Okay, alright. What do you want
from me? Just tell me. Just tell me!

359
00:26:02,178 --> 00:26:05,480
I want the man I fell in
love with a long time ago,

360
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,266
the one who gave me a son,

361
00:26:07,683 --> 00:26:10,269
the strong, confident
version of you,

362
00:26:10,787 --> 00:26:15,274
not the Roy who's out every night getting
hammered and banging a different bimbo.

363
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:29,321
Remember this: Osiris.

364
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,341
<i>- Osiris.</i>
- Okay.

365
00:26:47,264 --> 00:26:49,891
Look. It's Roid and Rage.

366
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:55,063
You know, carbohydrates
are not your friend, fellas.

367
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:03,155
- Doctor Wells. Are you well?
- Yes.

368
00:27:04,698 --> 00:27:07,784
- Does cigar smoke botther you?
- No, not at all.

369
00:27:16,252 --> 00:27:17,336
The Spindle.

370
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,966
Well, we're experiencing a
minor delay at the moment.

371
00:27:25,302 --> 00:27:26,595
Define 'minor'.

372
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:29,728
A week, two weeks at the most.

373
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:35,687
- And... why?
- R&D is never an exact science.

374
00:27:36,897 --> 00:27:40,692
And yet that's exactly what
we're after: exact... science.

375
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:45,489
Your, um... friend,
Captain Pulver.

376
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:49,826
<i>- Yes, he dropped off a resume.</i>
- And whatever possessed him.

377
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:55,461
Well, I may have mentioned in passing
the military presence here at the lab.

378
00:27:55,555 --> 00:27:57,209
And whatever possessed you?

379
00:27:58,294 --> 00:28:03,507
The security protocols of this facility
should not be the subject of pillow talk.

380
00:28:03,826 --> 00:28:06,385
I can assure you, they're not.

381
00:28:06,677 --> 00:28:09,387
- Roy and I are not...
- You are the mother of his child, no?

382
00:28:16,312 --> 00:28:18,730
Please, please, sit down.
Make yourself comfortable, I...

383
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,983
don't want this to seem
like an interrogation.

384
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:30,950
I'm not one for long stories,

385
00:28:30,997 --> 00:28:33,811
I'm someone who's always
appreciated brevity in any form.

386
00:28:33,995 --> 00:28:35,956
The shorter the
better. However...

387
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:40,512
I do have one story
that I've told and retold

388
00:28:40,613 --> 00:28:42,796
and it's a story that I'd
like to share with you now.

389
00:28:42,963 --> 00:28:44,423
If you'll indulge me.

390
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:49,135
- Ah, I happen to... like long stories.
- Oh good, then we're both in luck.

391
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:56,393
So... Burma 1979, I was
doing skunk work for the CIA,

392
00:28:56,854 --> 00:28:59,492
smuggling enough opium
into the country to backstop

393
00:28:59,586 --> 00:29:03,108
a very bloody military coup that we
would eventually stage a decade later.

394
00:29:03,251 --> 00:29:05,795
This is all mostly
declassified, mostly.

395
00:29:06,314 --> 00:29:08,989
At any rate... I find myself

396
00:29:09,196 --> 00:29:11,617
in the jungle. Outside Rangoon,

397
00:29:11,658 --> 00:29:14,578
sniping soldiers from
the KNU Liberation Front,

398
00:29:14,703 --> 00:29:19,165
in a three-day running firefight
that cost me my entire team.

399
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:21,287
So there I am,

400
00:29:21,436 --> 00:29:25,797
on the verge of being overrun by
a bunch of machete-wielding rebels

401
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:28,592
who have terrible attitudes
and even worse hygiene.

402
00:29:28,884 --> 00:29:32,273
And all I have is a Remington
Buckmaster with a shot-out scope

403
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:35,474
and 36 sleepless hours in
which to squeeze out a win.

404
00:29:38,268 --> 00:29:39,395
And then I hear it.

405
00:29:42,356 --> 00:29:45,204
This... piercing squeal,

406
00:29:45,942 --> 00:29:47,569
like a steam whistle.

407
00:29:50,447 --> 00:29:51,782
Wild boar.

408
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:55,243
Make you piss your pants.

409
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,305
The sound alone is enough
to make the rebels scatter.

410
00:29:59,352 --> 00:30:01,375
No one wants to
fuck with the tusks.

411
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:05,879
So now this son-of-a-bitch gets a sniff
of me and comes at me straight away.

412
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,582
Now I'd rather put a bullet
in ten men than kill an animal,

413
00:30:09,653 --> 00:30:11,092
but before I'm even presented

414
00:30:11,134 --> 00:30:15,758
with the do-or-die of it all,
an 18 foot Burmese Python

415
00:30:15,883 --> 00:30:21,227
comes down from a banyan tree, and wraps
up this raging hog like a Christmas ham.

416
00:30:23,104 --> 00:30:24,773
I've never seen
anything like it.

417
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:28,693
And for the next few hours,
I watch, in wonder, as this

418
00:30:28,756 --> 00:30:31,430
snake slowly suffocates
and devours this pig.

419
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,492
It was oddly quiet so I
could hear everything.

420
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:40,313
The boar's bones snapping, the
bellow's-like wheeze as its lungs collapsed

421
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,749
that made it sound like
the snake was laughing.

422
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:51,299
It remains... the most awe-inspiring
act of violence I have ever seen.

423
00:30:52,363 --> 00:30:54,386
But what struck me most.

424
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,957
Even as the python extended its
jaws a full two feet to devour its prey...

425
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:05,814
was the calm... and
calculation in it's eyes.

426
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:10,648
And it was until later...

427
00:31:11,011 --> 00:31:12,959
when it finally
moved its mid-section,

428
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:15,156
now distended with
the outline of that boar...

429
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:17,325
that I saw a dozen eggs.

430
00:31:17,951 --> 00:31:19,160
Python eggs.

431
00:31:20,871 --> 00:31:23,457
The boar was about
to trample it's nest.

432
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,711
So what I had first perceived
as an act of aggression...

433
00:31:28,211 --> 00:31:29,963
was actually an act of love.

434
00:31:31,881 --> 00:31:34,217
The snake killing the
boar not out of malice,

435
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:40,348
but out of necessity... to prevent
it's future from being obliterated.

436
00:31:46,354 --> 00:31:48,314
I enjoyed that story.

437
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:52,284
Oh, and I enjoyed telling
it. I also thought it apt.

438
00:31:52,694 --> 00:31:56,239
- How so?
<i>- No more visitors to the lab.</i>

439
00:31:56,532 --> 00:32:00,957
No ex-boyfriends, old flames
or shadowy figures from the past.

440
00:32:02,871 --> 00:32:04,706
If there's a delay in the work,

441
00:32:04,873 --> 00:32:07,213
I want to be apprised
of it post-haste.

442
00:32:07,338 --> 00:32:10,427
- Yes?
- Of course.

443
00:32:10,504 --> 00:32:12,380
Thank you, doctor.
That's wonderful.

444
00:32:27,366 --> 00:32:28,522
Do watch your step.

445
00:32:45,455 --> 00:32:48,792
- You want another one?
- Um, "another one" what?

446
00:32:54,452 --> 00:32:55,728
You are sweet...

447
00:32:58,684 --> 00:33:00,508
How long have you
two known each other?

448
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:02,663
We only met today.

449
00:33:03,172 --> 00:33:06,355
- He is my newest best friend.
- Yes I am.

450
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:10,015
- Alice is a dental hygienist.
- Which is weird 'cause I...

451
00:33:10,237 --> 00:33:12,556
really ...hate teeth.

452
00:33:12,941 --> 00:33:15,318
I mean, just the texture
of them grosses me out.

453
00:33:15,636 --> 00:33:19,862
- Then a career in dentistry seems like...
- Like the last thing I should be doing?

454
00:33:19,948 --> 00:33:24,620
Yeah, I know, I know. But, you
know, I'm... I'm all about the challenge.

455
00:33:24,913 --> 00:33:28,832
I like to really push myself
out of my comfort zone.

456
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:33,510
- It's the only way to grow, really.
- So true.

457
00:33:33,706 --> 00:33:37,173
He's so pretty. Isn't he pretty?

458
00:33:38,997 --> 00:33:40,791
How long have you
guys known each other?

459
00:33:41,427 --> 00:33:44,527
Ah, with Gabrielle? For as long
as I've been drinking in this bar.

460
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:50,493
- Since you got back from overseas.
- Oh, danger. Do tell!

461
00:33:50,556 --> 00:33:53,523
Oh, ladies, there's really
almost nothing to tell.

462
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:58,945
- Ah, may then tell us almost nothing?
<i>- Um, but... can you wait? Because...</i>

463
00:34:00,155 --> 00:34:02,574
I've gotta pee.
I'll be right back.

464
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:10,331
You should take her home, Roy.

465
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:14,460
You should take her home.

466
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:21,155
You had to ask:

467
00:34:22,165 --> 00:34:24,387
"Why not take you
home too, Gabrielle?"

468
00:34:25,221 --> 00:34:26,339
And I will say...

469
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:31,164
"Maybe another night".

470
00:34:33,886 --> 00:34:35,849
I'm starting to wear you down.

471
00:34:41,486 --> 00:34:43,366
We'd have fun, Roy, but...

472
00:34:44,117 --> 00:34:46,805
- we'd never be in love.
<i>- Oh, love.</i>

473
00:34:47,106 --> 00:34:49,044
- No.
- Why?

474
00:34:49,204 --> 00:34:50,956
- Why?
- Yeah.

475
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,742
Because you're still in love.

476
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:56,721
With someone else.

477
00:34:58,588 --> 00:34:59,881
<i>It's in your eyes.</i>

478
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,776
<i>In the sadness I see there.</i>

479
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:11,053
There is a woman you
long for, but... it's not me.

480
00:35:12,526 --> 00:35:16,217
<i>And it's not... our
lovely hygienist.</i>

481
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:27,075
<i>Bar, hello? Yeah.</i>

482
00:35:29,077 --> 00:35:31,371
- It's for you.
<i>- Who wants to call me now.</i>

483
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:33,067
<i>Don't know.</i>

484
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:35,115
<i>Hello?</i>

485
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:39,088
- Roy, can you hear me?
- Jemma? What...

486
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:42,069
<i>Are you still at the
lab? It's-it's almost 3 AM.</i>

487
00:35:42,298 --> 00:35:43,800
Jemma, Jemma, you okay?

488
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:45,454
- You alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine, but...

489
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,554
- Wh-what-what's going on? Listen...
- Yeah, listen to me.

490
00:35:50,807 --> 00:35:52,809
I think I might have to
do something drastic,

491
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:55,979
<i>and if anything happens,
promise me you'll do what you do...</i>

492
00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:01,189
- I can't-I can't-I can't hear you, <i>Jemma</i>.
<i>- I'm gonna need your help.</i>

493
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,278
Wait-wait-wait, wh-what's
going on, you okay?

494
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:06,498
<i>I can't explain it right now, but...
you wouldn't understand anyway.</i>

495
00:36:09,549 --> 00:36:11,202
Hey, I think I lost you.

496
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:14,233
Jemma, call me back, okay?

497
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:20,297
- Who was that?
- It was my ex, and she was...

498
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:22,745
She sounded pretty worked-up.

499
00:36:32,882 --> 00:36:35,220
It seems our dear
doctor has gone rogue.

500
00:36:37,437 --> 00:36:38,479
Find her.

501
00:36:42,275 --> 00:36:44,349
<i>What. Did. I.</i> Miss?

502
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:46,223
Oh, hi.

503
00:36:46,328 --> 00:36:49,846
Um... well, you know, we were talking
about the hottest people on that planet

504
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,632
and naturally, your
name came up.

505
00:37:17,643 --> 00:37:19,530
<i>I should have tried to
call Jemma back when</i>

506
00:37:19,585 --> 00:37:21,775
<i>I was drunk and horny
and I didn't give a shit.</i>

507
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,494
<i>I didn't know how
important it was.</i>

508
00:37:25,938 --> 00:37:28,793
<i>I didn't know it would be the last
time that I'd ever hear her voice.</i>

509
00:37:29,655 --> 00:37:31,282
<i>Some things you can't re-do.</i>

510
00:37:34,244 --> 00:37:37,413
<i>And some things you're forced
to do, over and over again.</i>

511
00:37:44,337 --> 00:37:46,714
<i>I know this whole
thing leads back to her.</i>

512
00:37:46,882 --> 00:37:50,246
<i>I just have no idea what...
"this whole thing" actually is.</i>

513
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:51,970
<i>Did you get my
birthday present, Roy?</i>

514
00:37:52,459 --> 00:37:54,266
<i>Did you</i> get it, the present?

515
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:58,726
<i>- I don't know, I haven't checked.
- Well please do, I sent it a few days ago.</i>

516
00:38:01,687 --> 00:38:04,732
<i>Remember this:</i> Osiris.

517
00:38:08,444 --> 00:38:12,490
"Happy birthday, Roy. May you always live
your life forward and always remember:"

518
00:38:13,137 --> 00:38:14,834
<i>"Time waits for no man."</i>

519
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:19,372
XO, X... oooh, fuck me!

520
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,147
<i>Let's do that again.</i>

521
00:38:31,803 --> 00:38:33,461
I'M BEING CAR-JACKED!!

522
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:49,318
Fuck!

523
00:38:54,428 --> 00:38:56,742
<i>C'me on, c'me on. Let's go.</i>

524
00:38:57,327 --> 00:39:01,414
<i>- Dude, die already, God damn it!
- He's in my way.</i>

525
00:39:01,896 --> 00:39:03,179
About fuckin' time.

526
00:39:07,247 --> 00:39:08,553
- I'M BEING CAR...!
- AAAHH!!

527
00:39:14,301 --> 00:39:15,983
<i>Don't read and drive, moron.</i>

528
00:39:43,474 --> 00:39:44,960
How did I never notice this?

529
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,556
<i>Shit, I missed the exit
to the Chinese restaurant.</i>

530
00:39:52,587 --> 00:39:55,385
<i>The last time I went anywhere
else, it ended up really bad.</i>

531
00:39:57,472 --> 00:40:00,475
<i>I call this guy Smiley,
for obvious reasons.</i>

532
00:40:07,831 --> 00:40:10,733
<i>At least getting shot is
simple. Straight-forward stuff.</i>

533
00:40:15,096 --> 00:40:16,739
<i>Who the hell thinks
up shit like this?</i>

534
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:29,694
<i>All I've been doing is running
for my life this entire time.</i>

535
00:40:30,049 --> 00:40:33,256
<i>Now I've got my first real clue to
what the fuck might be happening to me.</i>

536
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,679
<i>All I need now is
a little cease-fire</i>

537
00:40:35,718 --> 00:40:38,410
<i>and somewhere quiet where
I can get some reading done.</i>

538
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:47,155
<i>Osiris and Isis were a devoted
husband and wife. Blah-blah...</i>

539
00:40:47,228 --> 00:40:50,784
<i>She was an Egyptian high
priestess, an ideal mother and wife.</i>

540
00:40:51,757 --> 00:40:53,026
<i>Protector of the dead.</i>

541
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:57,780
<i>Skilled in all magical spells for
transport through the afterlife and beyond.</i>

542
00:41:01,242 --> 00:41:04,114
<i>Osiris was eventually
dismembered into 14 parts</i>

543
00:41:04,177 --> 00:41:06,664
<i>and scattered across
Egypt by his enemy.</i>

544
00:41:08,113 --> 00:41:10,365
<i>What the fuck kind of
birthday present is this?</i>

545
00:41:12,909 --> 00:41:16,790
<i>Happy birthday, Roy. May you always
live your life forward and remember:</i>

546
00:41:16,853 --> 00:41:19,944
<i>"Time... waits... for no man".</i>

547
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:26,985
<i>Joe.</i>

548
00:41:29,105 --> 00:41:30,801
<i>What the hell is he doing?</i>

549
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,260
<i>Oh shit.</i>

550
00:41:42,242 --> 00:41:45,286
<i>He doesn't know his Mom is
gone, and he's all alone now.</i>

551
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:49,582
<i>That I'm the only
family he has left.</i>

552
00:41:58,674 --> 00:42:01,719
<i>- How'd you do, pal?</i>
- Ten dollar entry, broham.

553
00:42:02,055 --> 00:42:03,945
Five dollar per round,
double elimination.

554
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:06,810
What, uh... What
you got going here?

555
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:10,853
- Pop-up e-sport tourney.
- What is that?

556
00:42:11,431 --> 00:42:12,938
Competitive video gaming.

557
00:42:13,229 --> 00:42:15,941
Yeah, we do mostly retro
eighties-based side-scrollers.

558
00:42:16,195 --> 00:42:18,694
Double Dragon, Altered
Beast, Street Fighter.

559
00:42:19,091 --> 00:42:22,392
We're purists, bro. Dedicated
to video games' golden age.

560
00:42:22,963 --> 00:42:26,577
Analog or death.
8-bit is the shit.

561
00:42:27,953 --> 00:42:31,916
- How old are you?
- The big four one. Life creeps up.

562
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:33,584
- Forty-one?
- Yeah.

563
00:42:34,254 --> 00:42:37,713
- You got a son here or something?
- I'm childless by choice, bro.

564
00:42:38,982 --> 00:42:40,049
Whose choice?

565
00:42:42,517 --> 00:42:43,517
Keep it.

566
00:43:27,862 --> 00:43:29,682
Joe yo, hey.

567
00:43:31,226 --> 00:43:34,854
- Hi bud.
- Roy. Hey, what's up?

568
00:43:34,965 --> 00:43:37,440
Look at you, you've
shot way up, huh?

569
00:43:37,857 --> 00:43:41,277
I think you were like [...]
high last time I saw you.

570
00:43:41,902 --> 00:43:45,448
- I didn't know you were a gamer.
- Oh, I am not a gamer.

571
00:43:45,724 --> 00:43:47,090
So what are you doing here?

572
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:51,102
Actually, I was gonna ask you the same
question, buddy. Isn't it a school day?

573
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:53,581
I ditched.

574
00:43:54,712 --> 00:43:56,459
Come on, buddy, you
can do better than this.

575
00:43:56,862 --> 00:43:58,919
Well, I couldn't not come.

576
00:43:59,086 --> 00:44:01,586
These are like my favourite
vintage video games.

577
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:02,000
Ahh...

578
00:44:02,133 --> 00:44:04,349
And Mom would be really
mad if she knew I was here.

579
00:44:04,411 --> 00:44:05,873
Mom would be really mad.

580
00:44:07,052 --> 00:44:09,659
I tell you what, I won't rat
you out if you tell me one thing.

581
00:44:09,745 --> 00:44:10,745
Okay...

582
00:44:11,272 --> 00:44:13,750
What did you buy from that
boy upstairs, the older boy?

583
00:44:14,101 --> 00:44:17,938
- I didn't buy anything.
- Joe. I saw you.

584
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,365
<i>It's an RPG card game.
I traded it with that kid.</i>

585
00:44:27,953 --> 00:44:31,202
<i>You can be like all these different
assassins and mercenaries and stuff...</i>

586
00:44:31,244 --> 00:44:33,871
- It's really cool.
- I bet it is.

587
00:44:35,956 --> 00:44:38,000
- So this is what you got from him?
- Uh-huh.

588
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,753
What, did you think I was
buying drugs or something?

589
00:44:41,296 --> 00:44:42,381
Or something.

590
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,224
I just turned eleven,
I can't do that stuff.

591
00:44:45,843 --> 00:44:49,138
You can't do that
stuff ever, pal. Okay?

592
00:44:49,832 --> 00:44:50,832
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

593
00:44:51,801 --> 00:44:54,602
Let's go get some lunch, we can
come back, okay? I want to talk to you.

594
00:44:54,845 --> 00:44:55,307
Alright?

595
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:58,771
- The screen is broken anyway.
- Ah, sh... piece of junk. Come on.

596
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:02,241
- You hungry, buddy?
- Yeah.

597
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:03,350
Yeah?

598
00:45:03,588 --> 00:45:06,351
- What's your favourite food?
- Pizza.

599
00:45:06,523 --> 00:45:07,668
- Pizza?
- Mm-hmm.

600
00:45:07,843 --> 00:45:09,798
We can go get some
pizza. What about sushi?

601
00:45:10,032 --> 00:45:11,691
- Don't like sushi.
- You don't?

602
00:45:11,847 --> 00:45:13,199
- No.
- How come?

603
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:16,539
- Because it's sushi.
- Oh! That makes sense.

604
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:20,608
<i>I have to tell him now.</i>

605
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:23,985
<i>Tell him his mother
is gone. Tell him that...</i>

606
00:45:24,482 --> 00:45:26,048
<i>he's never gonna see her again.</i>

607
00:45:26,481 --> 00:45:28,787
<i>- Tell him that...</i>
- You know, Mom says you're a badass.

608
00:45:29,617 --> 00:45:30,696
Badass?

609
00:45:31,596 --> 00:45:34,249
- She says that?
- Well, she doesn't use that word,

610
00:45:34,367 --> 00:45:35,567
but she says you're like...

611
00:45:35,761 --> 00:45:38,443
a SEAL team guy or
something, like a soldier.

612
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:43,065
- Mom talks about me?
- Yeah, she mentions you a lot.

613
00:45:43,258 --> 00:45:44,317
A lot?

614
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:50,509
Hey, are you like that
guy, the one from Taken,

615
00:45:50,595 --> 00:45:53,516
who has... a
particular set of skills

616
00:45:54,767 --> 00:45:56,503
- Liam Neeson?
- Yeah.

617
00:45:56,585 --> 00:46:00,291
No, he's... kind of a fake tough
guy, but me, I'm-I'm the real guy.

618
00:46:00,622 --> 00:46:02,877
- Really?
- I'm not kidding you, that's real.

619
00:46:03,228 --> 00:46:04,566
Oh, that's so cool.

620
00:46:11,874 --> 00:46:12,874
Hey, Joe.

621
00:46:18,222 --> 00:46:20,353
I gotta tell you something, bud.

622
00:46:21,772 --> 00:46:24,482
And it's gonna be
pretty hard to hear. 'kay?

623
00:46:25,985 --> 00:46:28,193
I don't have an
easy way to say this.

624
00:46:37,098 --> 00:46:38,413
<i>12:50</i>

625
00:46:39,045 --> 00:46:40,822
<i>3 minutes longer
than I've ever lived.</i>

626
00:46:42,809 --> 00:46:43,809
<i>How?</i>

627
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:49,146
<i>The inside is all metal.</i>

628
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:52,892
<i>Then I went below ground.</i>

629
00:46:59,707 --> 00:47:00,768
<i>They're tracking me!</i>

630
00:47:20,067 --> 00:47:21,718
What did you want
to tell me, Roy?

631
00:47:42,253 --> 00:47:43,253
Joe...

632
00:47:47,919 --> 00:47:49,442
I'm your father.

633
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:51,933
<i>In all that fear...</i>

634
00:47:52,434 --> 00:47:55,072
<i>I saw my son's love
for me for a split second.</i>

635
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:57,783
<i>And it was beautiful.</i>

636
00:47:59,889 --> 00:48:01,136
<i>Please.</i>

637
00:48:01,789 --> 00:48:03,533
<i>Please, let this
death be the last.</i>

638
00:48:07,553 --> 00:48:09,044
Motherfucker!

639
00:48:14,143 --> 00:48:16,411
- How are you tracking me?
- Aww! Fuck you!

640
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:18,754
Fuck me? Where's the device?!

641
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:21,223
- Up your ass.
- Oh, you're full of ideas!

642
00:48:23,026 --> 00:48:26,024
- Fuck off!
- Okay, fuck off!

643
00:48:31,025 --> 00:48:33,360
Heeey, buddy!

644
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:36,196
Okay. When you
gotta go, you gotta go.

645
00:48:36,572 --> 00:48:38,198
Where's this tracker?

646
00:48:38,783 --> 00:48:41,869
I know it's here...
where's this thing?

647
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:43,871
<i>Fuck.</i>

648
00:48:45,784 --> 00:48:48,145
Pedro... you want
to help me look?

649
00:48:51,211 --> 00:48:54,351
And then I said: "When I will see
your counter-intelligence expert,

650
00:48:54,477 --> 00:48:57,176
and raise you a counter-surveillance
specialist, my friend."

651
00:48:57,217 --> 00:48:59,566
You should have seen
that [...] look on his face.

652
00:48:59,578 --> 00:49:00,596
You... you're crazy!

653
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:01,689
Dave!

654
00:49:01,713 --> 00:49:03,069
- Hey, Roy.
- Hey.

655
00:49:03,223 --> 00:49:04,026
Sorry to interrupt.

656
00:49:04,038 --> 00:49:06,713
No-no-no, I was just telling Jake
over here about this loudmouth...

657
00:49:06,737 --> 00:49:09,303
Great, good. Dave, do you know
anything about tracking devices?

658
00:49:09,734 --> 00:49:12,024
I don't know anything
about that kind of thing, Roy.

659
00:49:12,373 --> 00:49:15,603
I know everything
about that kind of thing!

660
00:49:15,736 --> 00:49:17,773
What are we talking?
Traditional transponders...?

661
00:49:17,785 --> 00:49:19,030
The kind you put on a person.

662
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:21,808
- A body-based or an implantable device?
- Um, which's better?

663
00:49:22,011 --> 00:49:23,981
If you-if you don't want the person
to know they're being tracked.

664
00:49:24,005 --> 00:49:26,445
Well, an implantable
version is loads more reliable.

665
00:49:26,539 --> 00:49:28,182
A body-based device would
be attached to clothing...

666
00:49:28,206 --> 00:49:29,918
Dave, where would you implant
it? Where would you do it?

667
00:49:29,942 --> 00:49:32,088
Well, most people
think subcutaneously,

668
00:49:32,113 --> 00:49:34,754
- just underneath the skin...
- Okay, Dave, where would <b>you</b> put it?

669
00:49:34,899 --> 00:49:36,496
- Oh, you mean me, personally?
- You, personally.

670
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,926
Ha-ha! A Dave special.

671
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:41,680
What does that stupid face mean?

672
00:49:41,704 --> 00:49:43,672
- Hm? - Yeah.
- Hm? - Yeah.

673
00:49:44,264 --> 00:49:46,902
He gets it. Your
teeth, Roy. Your teeth!

674
00:49:47,452 --> 00:49:48,998
Ideally a molar.

675
00:49:50,789 --> 00:49:52,272
You gotta be shitting me.

676
00:49:53,854 --> 00:49:55,943
You look so handsome
with the mask on.

677
00:49:58,205 --> 00:50:01,949
You have nothing to worry
about. Just keep breathing deeply.

678
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:04,034
It'll all be over soon.

679
00:50:08,734 --> 00:50:11,333
Also, your mouth acts
as a natural transmitter.

680
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:12,535
- Dave?
- Yes?

681
00:50:12,606 --> 00:50:14,126
Would you be able
to look at a tooth...

682
00:50:14,626 --> 00:50:16,626
and detect if there was
a tracking device in it?

683
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:18,955
I mean, not while it's
inside someone mouth

684
00:50:18,987 --> 00:50:21,380
If that tooth were removed I
could possibly check it out...

685
00:50:21,392 --> 00:50:21,668
Jake!

686
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:24,072
A large bottle of Baijiu
and a pair of pliers, now.

687
00:50:29,268 --> 00:50:33,767
- AAHH! AWW!!
- No, no, no! Oh, God-damn! This shit!

688
00:50:33,848 --> 00:50:35,733
Don't worry, Dave,
it'll grow back.

689
00:50:35,775 --> 00:50:38,927
Have you lost your mind?! No,
no, you need some damn help!

690
00:50:38,966 --> 00:50:40,907
Not while your being so
helpful. What do you think?

691
00:50:40,931 --> 00:50:42,166
- No.
- You sure?

692
00:50:42,213 --> 00:50:43,606
- I'm positive!
- What time is it?!

693
00:50:43,786 --> 00:50:46,844
- Shit. It's 12:45.
- Oh shit. Only two minutes.

694
00:50:46,937 --> 00:50:49,543
Man, it is time for you to stop snatching
your damn teeth out of your mouth.

695
00:50:49,567 --> 00:50:51,224
- Are you crazy?!
- Aww...

696
00:50:51,313 --> 00:50:55,594
- Fuck this shit.
- No, no, no!! Oh God...

697
00:50:56,727 --> 00:50:58,945
I should have stayed
my black ass at home.

698
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,815
- Look! - No!
- Look!!

699
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,074
- Oh, my God.
- What?

700
00:51:04,099 --> 00:51:06,085
- Yeah. That tooth.
- Umm-hmm.

701
00:51:06,346 --> 00:51:07,897
There's an irregularity
in that tooth.

702
00:51:07,944 --> 00:51:10,102
- There is?
- Yeah. Oh, my God.

703
00:51:10,261 --> 00:51:12,645
I would need to
see... inside of it.

704
00:51:12,895 --> 00:51:14,236
- Roy?
- Yeah.

705
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:17,423
- Carefully.
- Yeah... <i>- Okay?</i>

706
00:51:18,011 --> 00:51:21,486
<i>Careful. No! No,
that's not careful!</i>

707
00:51:28,373 --> 00:51:31,121
- This son of a bitch...
- Oh, my God.

708
00:51:31,446 --> 00:51:32,532
- Roy.
- Huh?

709
00:51:32,793 --> 00:51:36,331
Someone paid a <b>lot</b> of
money to keep track of you.

710
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:39,304
- They did?
- Yeah. A whole lot. I've never...

711
00:51:41,734 --> 00:51:43,055
I'll see you soon, Dave.

712
00:51:50,625 --> 00:51:51,522
Who did it?!

713
00:51:51,546 --> 00:51:53,123
- Who put the tracker in my mouth?
- Let go...!

714
00:51:53,147 --> 00:51:55,319
- Who did it?!
- A guy called Brett...

715
00:51:55,938 --> 00:51:57,768
<i>Mr. Frat Boy, fake-bake bald</i>

716
00:51:57,815 --> 00:52:02,368
<i>400-pound "I-dye-my-beardhair-black"
douchebag head of Dynow security.</i>

717
00:52:02,446 --> 00:52:03,446
Brett.

718
00:52:04,075 --> 00:52:06,405
<i>I'm gonna punch a giant
fucking hole in his chest.</i>

719
00:52:06,819 --> 00:52:08,445
<i>- Howdy...</i>
- Jake.

720
00:52:10,243 --> 00:52:13,038
I need a large bottle of
Baijiu and a pair of pliers. Now.

721
00:52:18,522 --> 00:52:21,856
<i>I have died 144
times, as of today.</i>

722
00:52:23,048 --> 00:52:24,669
<i>But this particular day...</i>

723
00:52:25,811 --> 00:52:27,720
<i>I finally get to do
something about it.</i>

724
00:52:51,109 --> 00:52:52,244
<i>Drop it!</i>

725
00:52:53,088 --> 00:52:55,708
<i>- What, the tooth?
- No, not the tooth.</i>

726
00:52:58,358 --> 00:52:59,594
<i>I'm not dropping it.</i>

727
00:53:00,729 --> 00:53:02,587
Well, it drops or you drop.

728
00:53:02,741 --> 00:53:04,837
This is a custom
handmade Walter PPK

729
00:53:04,876 --> 00:53:07,533
that cost me nearly half a
million dollars at auction.

730
00:53:08,067 --> 00:53:10,012
You bought a handgun
for half a million dollars?

731
00:53:10,626 --> 00:53:15,822
And had my personal pistolsmith fit it
with a vintage SD-22 SpielWaffen suppressor

732
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,206
of which there are
six in the world...

733
00:53:18,277 --> 00:53:20,230
For an additional $250,000.

734
00:53:21,673 --> 00:53:24,710
- 750,000 bucks.
<i>- Correct.</i>

735
00:53:25,736 --> 00:53:28,096
Why in the fuck, Pam, would
you ever do something like that?

736
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:29,739
Pam?

737
00:53:30,826 --> 00:53:33,159
Well, I never got your
name, so I just call you Pam.

738
00:53:33,424 --> 00:53:36,914
<i>- We've met?</i>
- Many, many times. In passing.

739
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:38,434
Let me see it.

740
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:40,099
Slow.

741
00:53:40,793 --> 00:53:42,376
<i>Hold her by the trigger guard.</i>

742
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,070
Handle it as if it
were porcelain.

743
00:53:46,706 --> 00:53:47,706
<i>Please.</i>

744
00:53:48,801 --> 00:53:50,427
Soft as a whisper.

745
00:53:55,595 --> 00:53:57,754
- AH?
- Adolf.

746
00:53:58,434 --> 00:53:59,434
Hitler.

747
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:03,338
- Que?
- <i>It was a personal gift</i> from Carl Walther.

748
00:54:03,455 --> 00:54:05,075
Hitler kept it <i>in his
desk in Munich...</i>

749
00:54:05,217 --> 00:54:08,028
You've been killing me with
fuckin' Hitler's gun this whole time?!

750
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:10,324
It was stolen by an American
serviceman in 1945...

751
00:54:10,336 --> 00:54:10,990
Jesus Christ!

752
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:13,284
- What is wrong with you?
- Fast forward to the present day.

753
00:54:13,308 --> 00:54:14,840
<i>And it cost me a
Very. Pretty. Penny.</i>

754
00:54:14,852 --> 00:54:17,068
I didn't think this could
get any worse. And it has...

755
00:54:19,133 --> 00:54:21,541
- Who sent you?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

756
00:54:21,878 --> 00:54:23,668
- Hint-hint?
- Never.

757
00:54:24,062 --> 00:54:27,867
- Are you going to kill me now?
- No, Pam. I'm gonna shoot you.

758
00:54:31,686 --> 00:54:32,970
That's for the Jews.

759
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:38,893
Those too.

760
00:54:57,868 --> 00:55:00,395
Come on, boy! [...]!

761
00:55:01,122 --> 00:55:04,626
<i>Jemma put me here on purpose. I
don't know how, I don't know why.</i>

762
00:55:05,544 --> 00:55:08,713
<i>There's gotta be a good reason.
Shit, there's gotta be a great one.</i>

763
00:55:08,995 --> 00:55:11,508
Look. You lost your
phone, little fella.

764
00:55:11,694 --> 00:55:12,703
<i>But she's gone.</i>

765
00:55:13,659 --> 00:55:15,595
<i>Can't get back far
enough to reach her.</i>

766
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:17,876
<i>So... none of this matters now.</i>

767
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:21,143
<i>There's... only one real
piece of business left.</i>

768
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,020
<i>Revenge.</i>

769
00:55:30,513 --> 00:55:32,154
Things are getting warm, now.

770
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:36,116
- Did you eliminate the asset?
<i>- You mean assets. Plural.</i>

771
00:55:36,241 --> 00:55:38,372
<i>- Marshall.
- Hello, Brett.</i>

772
00:55:38,827 --> 00:55:41,205
<i>Don't ask who this is, 'cause
you know exactly who it is.</i>

773
00:55:41,246 --> 00:55:43,828
- Where's Marshall?
<i>- Who's that? Bomb boy?</i>

774
00:55:43,922 --> 00:55:44,971
The one I call Kaboom?

775
00:55:45,659 --> 00:55:48,412
Well, he's at a big company
barbeque at the moment.

776
00:55:48,628 --> 00:55:51,798
<i>We're only missing two members:
you and the shithead calling the shots.</i>

777
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:55,279
You assume there's
someone above me.

778
00:55:55,357 --> 00:55:57,703
Well, you're a lapdog, pal,
so there's gotta be a leash.

779
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,597
I want who's holding it.

780
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:01,808
I want who killed Jemma.

781
00:56:02,517 --> 00:56:03,685
<i>I think it's Ventor.</i>

782
00:56:04,979 --> 00:56:10,025
- Well, you know where we are, hotshot.
- <i>Yeah,</i> and I know how to get there.

783
00:56:10,817 --> 00:56:12,587
I'll see you in a
minute, motherfucker.

784
00:56:17,449 --> 00:56:20,196
<i>I'm guessing the Big Boss
Man has a penthouse view,</i>

785
00:56:20,313 --> 00:56:22,027
<i>but I'm about sick
to death of all the</i>

786
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:24,039
<i>sneaky stealth
"behind-the-scenes" bullshit.</i>

787
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:27,984
Let's go old-school and just...
kick the fucking front door down.

788
00:56:43,618 --> 00:56:45,060
That was a good plan.

789
00:56:49,064 --> 00:56:50,730
<i>I'm gonna gouge his eyes out.</i>

790
00:57:17,641 --> 00:57:18,971
Hold, hold, hold!

791
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,260
Fall back! Get down!

792
00:57:30,388 --> 00:57:31,856
<i>I can do this all day, dick.</i>

793
00:57:40,932 --> 00:57:42,409
<i>Hello, Roy number 2.</i>

794
00:57:55,697 --> 00:57:57,132
<i>Goodbye, Roy number 2.</i>

795
00:58:21,953 --> 00:58:24,118
<i>Roy number 2 was
unarmed and I'm positive.</i>

796
00:58:24,362 --> 00:58:26,328
<i>I'm not getting a
weapon past these guys.</i>

797
00:58:39,966 --> 00:58:41,043
Sir.

798
00:58:46,348 --> 00:58:48,600
Oh, yeah, sorry.

799
00:58:52,229 --> 00:58:53,563
<i>Access denied.</i>

800
00:58:57,567 --> 00:59:01,065
Oh, it's uh...
It's... must be me.

801
00:59:10,699 --> 00:59:11,699
<i>Sir!</i>

802
00:59:20,549 --> 00:59:21,763
Hi, Roy.

803
00:59:23,921 --> 00:59:27,222
<i>So do I do a "Butch and
Sundance" blaze of glory bit here?</i>

804
00:59:27,716 --> 00:59:30,015
<i>Nah.</i> Never say die.

805
00:59:34,586 --> 00:59:35,586
That was weird.

806
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:43,947
You big motherfucker.

807
01:00:13,627 --> 01:00:15,312
Hello, handsome.

808
01:00:16,104 --> 01:00:19,399
You... cut my head off
a couple of dozen times.

809
01:00:19,576 --> 01:00:22,061
Someone's been the
busiest little beaver.

810
01:00:27,264 --> 01:00:28,575
What are you gonna do with that?

811
01:00:32,823 --> 01:00:34,264
I was thinking
about fucking you up.

812
01:00:36,022 --> 01:00:38,057
Remember in "Raiders",
that asshole who was

813
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:41,434
twirling the sword around and
around thinking he was all cool and shit?

814
01:00:42,025 --> 01:00:44,582
Indy just shot him, 'cause he
was exhausted and impatient

815
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,067
and just couldn't take
the bullshit any more.

816
01:00:46,091 --> 01:00:47,828
- You remember that?
- Yeah.

817
01:00:51,545 --> 01:00:52,545
Fuck!

818
01:00:54,726 --> 01:00:57,812
<i>Something you might not know
about getting killed with a sword.</i>

819
01:00:57,837 --> 01:01:00,005
With the exception of
attempt number 15...

820
01:01:00,482 --> 01:01:03,790
getting killed with a sword...
hurts worse than a gunshot.

821
01:01:05,267 --> 01:01:07,465
Another lesser known
fact about swords.

822
01:01:11,117 --> 01:01:13,267
They hurt a hell of a
lot more coming out.

823
01:01:13,353 --> 01:01:16,162
Fun fact: Harrison
Ford had the shits,

824
01:01:16,249 --> 01:01:17,624
and that's why he shot that guy.

825
01:01:26,966 --> 01:01:28,218
I am Guan-Jin!

826
01:01:28,802 --> 01:01:30,470
And Guan-Jin has done this.

827
01:01:42,984 --> 01:01:44,126
I am Guan-Jin!

828
01:01:44,568 --> 01:01:46,361
And Guan-Jin has done this.

829
01:01:52,939 --> 01:01:54,097
I am Guan-Jin.

830
01:01:54,887 --> 01:01:56,246
And Guan-Jin has done this.

831
01:02:15,348 --> 01:02:17,694
I'm Guan-Jin and I've done this.

832
01:02:18,992 --> 01:02:20,770
<i>And this isn't
even the worst part.</i>

833
01:02:21,885 --> 01:02:24,274
<i>This is. Ventor.</i>

834
01:02:24,816 --> 01:02:26,318
<i>The man who killed Jemma.</i>

835
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:30,298
<i>Same bozo that's had me
killed a 150 fucking times.</i>

836
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:34,158
Captain, as first impressions
go, this is truly stand-out stuff.

837
01:02:34,659 --> 01:02:36,716
<i>How you were able to
despatch the elite level of</i>

838
01:02:36,778 --> 01:02:39,867
high-speed professionals we
threw at you, is really remarkable.

839
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:43,611
You should be pleased with the
effort, regardless of its outcome.

840
01:02:44,628 --> 01:02:47,547
<i>As someone who bears the
same</i> fraternal scars of battle,

841
01:02:47,589 --> 01:02:51,217
I hope that this defeat, however
bitter... holds some solace.

842
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:56,175
<i>He must that bullshit memorized, because
it's word for fucking word the same,</i>

843
01:02:56,199 --> 01:02:58,182
<i>every single fucking time.</i>

844
01:02:58,675 --> 01:03:02,423
All the men I've watched die and
lain to rest, in their multitudes...

845
01:03:03,228 --> 01:03:04,731
I see a singularity.

846
01:03:06,179 --> 01:03:07,274
It's in the eyes.

847
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:10,294
Their gaze is identical
in this moment.

848
01:03:11,067 --> 01:03:12,864
<i>Remorse, regret.</i>

849
01:03:13,258 --> 01:03:14,620
What could I have done?

850
01:03:15,301 --> 01:03:16,552
What didn't I do?

851
01:03:18,267 --> 01:03:21,497
All our best intentions left to
bleed out, with the rest of us.

852
01:03:22,791 --> 01:03:27,086
But what if we could remake our
world whole... and erase our mistakes?

853
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:30,954
What if the ability to
rewrite history was real?

854
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:33,642
Adolf Hitler, Pearl Harbor...

855
01:03:33,654 --> 01:03:36,462
<i>Wait a minute, wait a minute, I
never lived past this point, so...</i>

856
01:03:36,486 --> 01:03:37,722
<i>all this crap is new.</i>

857
01:03:37,764 --> 01:03:43,054
In whose hands would you entrust a
tool as powerful as the Osiris Spindle?

858
01:03:44,267 --> 01:03:45,980
I have your answer, Captain.

859
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:47,941
Mine.

860
01:03:48,983 --> 01:03:51,449
A man brought to heel by
the brunt of human misery,

861
01:03:51,535 --> 01:03:53,988
a man who understands,
as you do, the horrors of war.

862
01:03:54,405 --> 01:03:57,241
Who better to oversee
and implement such a tool?

863
01:04:00,161 --> 01:04:01,162
Exactly.

864
01:04:03,208 --> 01:04:05,304
I am sorry about Dr. Wells.

865
01:04:05,705 --> 01:04:09,253
She took us as far as her...
flawed ideology allowed her.

866
01:04:09,898 --> 01:04:11,032
Sweet girl.

867
01:04:12,378 --> 01:04:15,946
Blood on your hands - is what you
wanted when you came here, Captain.

868
01:04:16,634 --> 01:04:19,305
And blood... is what you have.

869
01:04:20,432 --> 01:04:21,808
Just not mine.

870
01:04:27,273 --> 01:04:30,049
That's really sharp.
Not even any blood on it.

871
01:04:30,535 --> 01:04:33,626
- Is it a katana?
- Katana? That's Japanese.

872
01:04:33,692 --> 01:04:34,870
It's a Chinese sword...

873
01:04:34,882 --> 01:04:37,119
Let's not make this
about race. It's a sword.

874
01:04:37,971 --> 01:04:39,051
Brett, umm...

875
01:04:39,912 --> 01:04:41,325
<i>I know three things now.</i>

876
01:04:41,349 --> 01:04:44,706
<i>One: I'm gonna fuck that
guy up next time I see him.</i>

877
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:48,418
<i>Two: whatever I'm stuck in
is called The Osiris Spindle.</i>

878
01:04:48,512 --> 01:04:51,337
<i>And three: Ventor has
no idea that it's working.</i>

879
01:04:52,046 --> 01:04:56,468
<i>That somehow, Jemma put me inside
this thing and started it up. But why?</i>

880
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:01,473
She resurrected her
dead husband, Osiris.

881
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:04,643
<i>Osiris became Lord of the Dead</i>

882
01:05:06,478 --> 01:05:07,979
And the afterlife.

883
01:05:12,526 --> 01:05:13,771
I'm Osiris.

884
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:31,029
<i>Jemma put me in the
Spindle to stop them.</i>

885
01:05:31,376 --> 01:05:32,612
<i>To stop Ventor.</i>

886
01:05:33,379 --> 01:05:36,189
<i>She needs me to keep
repeating this day until I do.</i>

887
01:05:36,716 --> 01:05:38,718
<i>She had... she had faith.</i>

888
01:05:40,053 --> 01:05:42,221
<i>Son of a bitch, she
still believed in me.</i>

889
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:44,766
<i>She knew I could beat 'em.</i>

890
01:05:53,772 --> 01:05:54,772
Hi.

891
01:05:55,142 --> 01:05:56,954
[mumbles] I need to learn
how to fight with a sword.

892
01:05:56,978 --> 01:05:59,405
- I have no idea what you just said.
<i>- Oh, it's...</i>

893
01:06:03,803 --> 01:06:05,662
I need to learn to
fight with a sword.

894
01:06:07,778 --> 01:06:10,274
There is something
intriguing about you that I like.

895
01:06:11,322 --> 01:06:13,377
I'm flying home to
Shanghai in the morning.

896
01:06:13,929 --> 01:06:15,351
I would only have a day.

897
01:06:16,489 --> 01:06:18,522
I thinik we can get
a lot done in a day.

898
01:06:36,048 --> 01:06:38,520
I'm a beginner, but...
I'm a quick learner.

899
01:06:39,091 --> 01:06:42,103
It is the one who wields it
that makes it a weapon, Roy.

900
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:46,381
That sword is no more an extension
of you than a set of car keys.

901
01:06:46,814 --> 01:06:49,599
I've had some training,
but... I'm willing to work hard.

902
01:06:49,942 --> 01:06:51,465
In lesser hands...

903
01:06:51,742 --> 01:06:55,169
the Jian blade is just a
flimsy piece of forged steel.

904
01:06:55,959 --> 01:06:58,059
But within the most
determined grip...

905
01:06:58,403 --> 01:07:00,562
and under the keenest eyes...

906
01:07:01,445 --> 01:07:03,803
it becomes a
weapon of annihilation.

907
01:07:04,804 --> 01:07:08,096
I've had a very good teacher,
but... I need to learn more.

908
01:07:31,176 --> 01:07:33,082
Hello, handsome.

909
01:07:36,997 --> 01:07:38,630
Are you surrendering?

910
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:47,138
<i>You're not really going to
fight with a sword, are you?</i>

911
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,335
I do like your confidence.

912
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:56,522
Normally I'm a
little more chatty.

913
01:07:58,471 --> 01:07:59,942
I do have one thing to say.

914
01:08:01,725 --> 01:08:02,725
I think it will wait.

915
01:08:04,739 --> 01:08:06,395
Shit's about to get steel.

916
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:27,981
Mother-fucker.

917
01:09:17,269 --> 01:09:18,479
What I wanted to say was:

918
01:09:18,968 --> 01:09:22,253
"I am Roy. And
Roy has done this."

919
01:09:37,623 --> 01:09:38,623
W-whoa.

920
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:41,209
Brett...

921
01:09:42,861 --> 01:09:44,792
I smell muffins. Do
you smell muffins?

922
01:09:52,261 --> 01:09:54,140
I'll just... walk it off.

923
01:09:55,098 --> 01:09:56,320
And now I'm blind.

924
01:09:58,322 --> 01:10:02,568
- Looks like a 400-pound unicorn.
- You slippery son of a bitch.

925
01:10:04,943 --> 01:10:07,946
- You gonna go for that gun?
- I am not.

926
01:10:08,651 --> 01:10:10,114
- Do you know why?
- No.

927
01:10:10,294 --> 01:10:13,215
Because I'm gonna get great satisfaction
from beating the shit out of you.

928
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:34,262
How?

929
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:36,890
How do you think?

930
01:10:38,942 --> 01:10:42,743
- The Spindle. She activated it.
- Jemma. She put me inside, pal.

931
01:10:42,985 --> 01:10:44,747
She put me inside to stop you.

932
01:10:45,224 --> 01:10:47,019
- Then you killed her.
- Aww!

933
01:10:47,187 --> 01:10:48,707
Because she knew
what you were, Ventor.

934
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:53,164
A wannabe dictator...
bent on a worldwide re-do.

935
01:10:53,713 --> 01:10:55,326
Fucking liberals.

936
01:10:56,059 --> 01:10:59,085
Before she launched her little
Hail-Mary, did she bother to mention

937
01:10:59,306 --> 01:11:02,856
<i>that a Spindle reaction, if maintained
too long, can destroy the entire planet?</i>

938
01:11:02,965 --> 01:11:05,987
Don't worry, dickhead. If the world comes
to an end, you won't be around to see it.

939
01:11:06,011 --> 01:11:08,047
The Spindle gives
us the power of God.

940
01:11:08,365 --> 01:11:11,342
To re-create our whole
world, minus the tragedy.

941
01:11:11,775 --> 01:11:15,221
- Adolf Hitler, 9/11...
- Shut up with this bullshit speech.

942
01:11:15,429 --> 01:11:19,475
The past is the past, Ventor!
It's designed to be left behind.

943
01:11:19,854 --> 01:11:22,020
We live... and we learn from it.

944
01:11:22,303 --> 01:11:25,064
And this from an absentee
husband and a failed father.

945
01:11:28,797 --> 01:11:31,957
I would have thought you'd have more
than a passing interest in re-doing things.

946
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:34,431
What about your son?

947
01:11:36,776 --> 01:11:38,739
- My son?
- Young Joe, isn't it?

948
01:11:40,204 --> 01:11:42,581
If you've come all
this way to kill me...

949
01:11:43,279 --> 01:11:45,023
well, then who's saving him?

950
01:11:51,689 --> 01:11:53,848
<i>I never thought Joe would
be in danger. I never...</i>

951
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:57,697
<i>thought in a million years
that... they'd ever target him.</i>

952
01:11:59,307 --> 01:12:01,506
<i>I'll kill Ventor and every
one of those motherfuckers</i>

953
01:12:01,561 --> 01:12:03,293
<i>a thousand times
if they hurt that kid.</i>

954
01:12:04,895 --> 01:12:09,211
<i>Sir, sir! Behind the barricade,
sir! Can't go that way, sir!</i>

955
01:12:12,736 --> 01:12:15,389
Pal, pal, I need you
behind the barricade! Pal!

956
01:12:30,358 --> 01:12:32,173
<i>How many times
have I let him die?</i>

957
01:12:34,697 --> 01:12:35,697
<i>MY SON!!</i>

958
01:12:47,355 --> 01:12:50,454
It's my son! <i>I need
to save my son!</i>

959
01:12:52,568 --> 01:12:53,945
NO!!

960
01:13:05,518 --> 01:13:06,787
<i>And there it is.</i>

961
01:13:08,907 --> 01:13:10,003
<i>The end of the world.</i>

962
01:13:10,556 --> 01:13:11,556
<i>Why not?</i>

963
01:13:12,439 --> 01:13:13,439
<i>Mine's already over.</i>

964
01:13:16,467 --> 01:13:19,053
<i>I can feel it. Not just death.</i>

965
01:13:19,452 --> 01:13:21,348
<i>Being unravelled,
every part of me...</i>

966
01:13:21,579 --> 01:13:24,324
<i>splits and splits again,
along with everything else.</i>

967
01:13:25,017 --> 01:13:28,192
<i>There's nowhere left to run and
one person who can help is dead.</i>

968
01:13:29,073 --> 01:13:30,940
<i>So what if I avenged her?</i>

969
01:13:31,254 --> 01:13:34,443
<i>I'm the one that killed
her. Not Ventor, me. I did it.</i>

970
01:13:34,732 --> 01:13:36,654
<i>I killed her when I ran
from our relationship,</i>

971
01:13:36,695 --> 01:13:39,417
<i>I killed her when I ran from
raising our son. I killed her...</i>

972
01:13:40,115 --> 01:13:41,492
<i>when I didn't call her back.</i>

973
01:13:43,457 --> 01:13:45,371
<i>I'm the reason she's gone.</i>

974
01:13:46,288 --> 01:13:47,789
<i>I'm the reason Joe's gone.</i>

975
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:51,413
<i>I am the reason the world ends.</i>

976
01:13:53,017 --> 01:13:54,297
<i>What the hell is the point?</i>

977
01:13:55,451 --> 01:13:57,466
<i>Why the hell should
I even bother trying?</i>

978
01:13:58,656 --> 01:14:00,330
<i>Nothing will ever matter again.</i>

979
01:14:02,779 --> 01:14:04,848
<i>Not when you've lost
everything you've loved.</i>

980
01:14:07,236 --> 01:14:11,397
<i>Not when you're responsible... for the
loss of all the human life as we know it.</i>

981
01:14:12,493 --> 01:14:13,732
<i>Nice job, asshole.</i>

982
01:14:19,863 --> 01:14:26,537
Can't you! Ever! Let me!
Sleep! In! Just! Once?!

983
01:14:29,999 --> 01:14:31,375
<i>So this is it, then.</i>

984
01:14:32,511 --> 01:14:33,669
<i>This is it, huh?</i>

985
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,881
<i>Are you just gonna feel
sorry for yourself, forever?</i>

986
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:40,013
<i>Day in, day out? You're not
gonna do a goddamn thing?</i>

987
01:14:40,317 --> 01:14:42,660
<i>Even if there isn't a
goddamn thing you can do?</i>

988
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:44,920
<i>Nah.</i>

989
01:14:45,649 --> 01:14:46,649
<i>You are.</i>

990
01:14:47,221 --> 01:14:48,767
<i>You're gonna do something.</i>

991
01:15:08,933 --> 01:15:10,384
<i>Time means nothing now.</i>

992
01:15:10,856 --> 01:15:12,515
It's no longer
counting against you.

993
01:15:12,648 --> 01:15:13,828
I'M BEING CAR-JA...!!

994
01:15:15,197 --> 01:15:16,962
<i>You never got to
know your son, so...</i>

995
01:15:17,442 --> 01:15:18,839
if that's all that's left...

996
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:22,626
<i>it's more than
you ever deserved.</i>

997
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:30,240
<i>Hey, Joe!</i>

998
01:15:31,721 --> 01:15:32,721
Roy!

999
01:15:32,886 --> 01:15:35,273
What are-what are you doing
here? What happened to you?

1000
01:15:35,314 --> 01:15:36,815
Ah, I fell off a building.

1001
01:15:37,662 --> 01:15:38,692
Skipping school?

1002
01:15:41,611 --> 01:15:44,895
- Let me guess: pop-up e-sports tournament.
<i>- How'd you know?</i>

1003
01:15:45,658 --> 01:15:47,951
- Where do you think I'm going?
- You're a gamer?

1004
01:15:48,233 --> 01:15:49,797
Absolutely I'm a gamer.

1005
01:15:50,431 --> 01:15:53,217
I knew you were on your X-Box every
time I came over, but I didn't want to

1006
01:15:53,241 --> 01:15:55,000
- blow it with your Mom, you know.
- Yeah.

1007
01:15:55,472 --> 01:15:58,610
I'm into like, the old 80's
vintage side-scroller games

1008
01:15:58,649 --> 01:16:00,653
like Altered Beast
and Double Dragon?

1009
01:16:00,716 --> 01:16:03,038
- Street Fighter?
- It's my favourite.

1010
01:16:04,175 --> 01:16:06,095
- Mine too. - Yeah?
- Yeah.

1011
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:09,598
- I like the new stuff, too, though. Umm...
<i>- Hey, Roy.</i>

1012
01:16:10,396 --> 01:16:12,893
Do you think Mom will be
pissed that I bailed on school?

1013
01:16:14,785 --> 01:16:15,785
You know what?

1014
01:16:17,157 --> 01:16:18,157
<i>She'll be pissed.</i>

1015
01:16:20,059 --> 01:16:21,059
But...

1016
01:16:21,508 --> 01:16:23,471
I'm gonna cover for you. Okay?

1017
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:26,901
- Okay.
- No more skipping school, cool? - Cool.

1018
01:16:27,832 --> 01:16:30,035
- Cool?
- Cool.

1019
01:16:33,001 --> 01:16:34,995
So let's go play
some Street Fighter.

1020
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:38,252
<i>- You're gonna die.
- No, you're gonna die.</i>

1021
01:16:38,544 --> 01:16:40,421
<i>You're gonna die and fail...</i>

1022
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:45,008
<i>Oh, my bad!</i> Oh,
but I'm still alive!

1023
01:16:45,218 --> 01:16:48,387
<i>This game is so old!
What's it called, Glaca?</i>

1024
01:16:48,710 --> 01:16:50,770
- The game's broken.
- Galaga. Galaga.

1025
01:16:51,365 --> 01:16:52,772
Right in the face! Aim!

1026
01:16:53,463 --> 01:16:54,847
- I still won.
- I got it!

1027
01:16:57,938 --> 01:16:58,939
K.O.

1028
01:17:00,274 --> 01:17:02,901
- You win!
- Why do you like this game so much?

1029
01:17:03,486 --> 01:17:06,280
Well, there's a lot of people that
chase you and you get to kill them.

1030
01:17:06,322 --> 01:17:08,873
- That was a power boost!
<i>- Oh, that was Aku-Aru-Arugula?</i>

1031
01:17:08,935 --> 01:17:11,160
- Was that the Arugula?
- Hadouken!

1032
01:17:11,202 --> 01:17:12,786
<i>Haru-gen again!</i>

1033
01:17:13,894 --> 01:17:16,524
HARUUU-GEN!!

1034
01:17:16,961 --> 01:17:19,126
- How did you ...?
<i>- You win!</i>

1035
01:17:20,043 --> 01:17:23,256
- This is where it it gets hard.
- Yeah, get the girl. Get the girl.

1036
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:28,927
You know what? Let me
show you how its done.

1037
01:17:29,581 --> 01:17:31,222
<i>Man, these guys keep comin'...</i>

1038
01:17:32,005 --> 01:17:33,307
You have no idea.

1039
01:17:33,726 --> 01:17:34,438
<i>I'm not letting go...</i>

1040
01:17:34,696 --> 01:17:37,377
For a kid who doesn't go to school
that much, you're pretty smart.

1041
01:17:38,317 --> 01:17:39,730
I have my ways.

1042
01:17:40,983 --> 01:17:42,608
You beat me again!

1043
01:17:42,682 --> 01:17:44,591
Oh, come on, it's The Master!

1044
01:17:45,702 --> 01:17:47,759
<i>All the years of
this that I missed.</i>

1045
01:17:49,239 --> 01:17:50,451
<i>I want it all back.</i>

1046
01:17:54,586 --> 01:17:56,079
<i>He has Jemma's looks...</i>

1047
01:17:56,747 --> 01:17:58,723
<i>her smarts, her sense of humor.</i>

1048
01:17:59,625 --> 01:18:00,751
<i>Thank God.</i>

1049
01:18:02,471 --> 01:18:04,755
<i>Then I see that kid
laugh, and I see myself.</i>

1050
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:06,122
<i>Just a flash.</i>

1051
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,634
<i>I see my own face,
smiling back at me</i>

1052
01:18:09,675 --> 01:18:10,719
<i>Breaks my heart.</i>

1053
01:18:18,721 --> 01:18:20,082
<i>I could do forever.</i>

1054
01:18:20,645 --> 01:18:21,647
<i>And I just might.</i>

1055
01:18:26,412 --> 01:18:31,229
<i>We've ended this day, just like
this... over a dozen times now.</i>

1056
01:18:32,062 --> 01:18:33,284
<i>It never gets old.</i>

1057
01:18:34,201 --> 01:18:36,912
<i>I like that he's sound
asleep when it all ends.</i>

1058
01:18:37,161 --> 01:18:38,914
<i>I like that he never stirs once.</i>

1059
01:18:47,047 --> 01:18:51,134
<i>I want to tell him that I'm his father,
like I did before, but I'm scared.</i>

1060
01:18:52,636 --> 01:18:54,555
<i>I'm scared he won't
look at me that way again.</i>

1061
01:18:54,954 --> 01:18:57,057
<i>I won't see what
I saw in his eyes.</i>

1062
01:18:57,676 --> 01:18:58,935
<i>So I say nothing.</i>

1063
01:19:06,627 --> 01:19:09,778
I want to get a boat one
day. Take Mom out in it.

1064
01:19:10,985 --> 01:19:12,948
<i>She's... never gets out at all.</i>

1065
01:19:13,459 --> 01:19:15,826
<i>I just... wish I could rent one.</i>

1066
01:19:17,202 --> 01:19:19,288
- Could we rent one?
- A boat?

1067
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:21,540
<i>Yeah. Take Mom out in it.</i>

1068
01:19:22,416 --> 01:19:24,543
- I don't see why not.
<i>- When?</i>

1069
01:19:25,294 --> 01:19:26,587
Whenever, I... we could...

1070
01:19:27,407 --> 01:19:30,754
<i>This is when I tell him...
we can do it this weekend.</i>

1071
01:19:31,146 --> 01:19:34,303
<i>Then he send his Mom a text
telling her that we're all going sailing.</i>

1072
01:19:34,637 --> 01:19:36,096
<i>This is what usually happens.</i>

1073
01:19:36,336 --> 01:19:37,498
Joey...

1074
01:19:39,308 --> 01:19:41,933
- You know, your Mom...
- Yeah?

1075
01:19:44,688 --> 01:19:47,141
Do you know what
your Mom is working on?

1076
01:19:47,592 --> 01:19:49,883
- The Osiris Spindle?
- Osiris Spindle.

1077
01:19:51,144 --> 01:19:52,321
You know what that does?

1078
01:19:52,912 --> 01:19:56,074
She can't talk about it, because
it's like super secret and whatever.

1079
01:19:56,447 --> 01:19:59,537
But... I overheard her say
it could wipe out everything,

1080
01:19:59,578 --> 01:20:01,747
like the world, I guess,
if they weren't careful.

1081
01:20:02,355 --> 01:20:03,499
Do you believe that?

1082
01:20:05,709 --> 01:20:06,710
Yeah, I do.

1083
01:20:08,353 --> 01:20:09,838
I wish I didn't.

1084
01:20:12,341 --> 01:20:15,056
Your Mom trusted me with
something and I let her down.

1085
01:20:16,870 --> 01:20:17,888
What do you mean?

1086
01:20:19,923 --> 01:20:21,232
Last night, you know...

1087
01:20:21,667 --> 01:20:24,216
- your Mom, she, um...
- She didn't come home.

1088
01:20:25,181 --> 01:20:26,181
I know.

1089
01:20:27,794 --> 01:20:29,525
Does she have a new boyfriend?

1090
01:20:32,715 --> 01:20:33,497
No.

1091
01:20:33,684 --> 01:20:37,783
- There's no new boyfriend, nah.
- Did she know I was ditching school?

1092
01:20:38,992 --> 01:20:41,620
- It felt like you were following me.
- Yeah, I was, I... I...

1093
01:20:41,755 --> 01:20:44,766
- but not f-for that reason.
- Why then?

1094
01:20:45,717 --> 01:20:48,714
I... I don't know. I saw you and
I wanted to talk to you, I mean,

1095
01:20:48,738 --> 01:20:51,088
catch up, we haven't
speak- spoken to each other.

1096
01:20:54,904 --> 01:20:56,885
Why did you think I
was following you?

1097
01:20:57,930 --> 01:20:59,847
Just something Mom
said this morning.

1098
01:21:01,292 --> 01:21:03,905
- Wait, what?
- On the phone. It was weird.

1099
01:21:03,975 --> 01:21:06,937
She said if I got into any
trouble, that I should find you.

1100
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:08,638
Joe, it's Mom. Pick

1101
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:10,827
up the phone, please.

1102
01:21:10,944 --> 01:21:13,944
- I didn't know what she was talking about.
- You spoke to Mom, today?

1103
01:21:14,199 --> 01:21:17,908
If anything strange ha-happens,
I want you to call Roy, okay?

1104
01:21:18,401 --> 01:21:21,091
- What time?
- I don't know, um...

1105
01:21:21,278 --> 01:21:24,392
I'm gonna text you his number,
but call me back. Bye baby.

1106
01:21:25,586 --> 01:21:27,259
Hey bud, let me see your phone.

1107
01:21:33,079 --> 01:21:35,019
<i>She was still alive
when I woke up.</i>

1108
01:21:35,339 --> 01:21:36,880
<i>Ventor hadn't killed her.</i>

1109
01:21:40,406 --> 01:21:41,722
<i>She wasn't dead yet.</i>

1110
01:21:49,897 --> 01:21:52,925
Don't worry, son. I'll
come back for you.

1111
01:21:54,506 --> 01:21:56,069
<i>I'm coming back for both of you.</i>

1112
01:22:09,458 --> 01:22:10,584
You killed her.

1113
01:22:11,595 --> 01:22:14,535
- Ah, how the hell did you get in here?
- Where is she?

1114
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:16,563
Where is she?!

1115
01:22:55,052 --> 01:22:58,949
- You trying to erase the evidence?
- Trying to figure out what she was doing.

1116
01:22:59,417 --> 01:23:01,317
How she was able to
initiate the Spindle...

1117
01:23:01,329 --> 01:23:02,391
Shut your mouth, Brett!

1118
01:23:04,135 --> 01:23:06,717
Continue. CONTINUE!!

1119
01:23:08,564 --> 01:23:12,521
We can't... get the
Osiris Spindle to function.

1120
01:23:13,793 --> 01:23:18,172
Whatever she did started a
chain reaction that we can't control.

1121
01:23:19,493 --> 01:23:23,274
She sabotaged it somehow
and it's not responding.

1122
01:23:23,907 --> 01:23:25,283
You son of a bitch.

1123
01:23:26,284 --> 01:23:27,911
The Spindle is working.

1124
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:31,707
It's you. She made
you the missing mass.

1125
01:23:32,082 --> 01:23:35,134
<i>Otherwise, how could you
have broken into this facility?</i>

1126
01:23:36,712 --> 01:23:37,713
<i>How...</i>

1127
01:23:38,935 --> 01:23:40,966
How many times
have you done this?

1128
01:23:42,509 --> 01:23:45,242
- A lot.
- It works.

1129
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:53,436
<i>She was alive at least
14 minutes after I woke up.</i>

1130
01:23:54,938 --> 01:23:56,607
<i>I have time to save her.</i>

1131
01:24:05,894 --> 01:24:08,780
Okay. Lets do this.

1132
01:24:11,034 --> 01:24:12,677
<i>Jemma is the only
one who can stop this,</i>

1133
01:24:12,716 --> 01:24:14,683
<i>and you have at least
14 minutes to reach her.</i>

1134
01:24:15,208 --> 01:24:17,044
What the hell. Here we go!

1135
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:29,472
The fuckin' asshole just jumped.

1136
01:24:36,922 --> 01:24:38,173
Fly, motherfucker!

1137
01:24:38,995 --> 01:24:39,995
FLY!!

1138
01:24:43,979 --> 01:24:46,928
I've got twelve and a half
minutes. Make this thing go faster.

1139
01:24:47,890 --> 01:24:48,890
Move!

1140
01:24:55,610 --> 01:24:56,861
<i>Nice flying, dick.</i>

1141
01:25:11,869 --> 01:25:14,309
<i>I want the big
knock-down drag out now...</i>

1142
01:25:15,272 --> 01:25:18,146
<i>A Donnybrook. The Battle Royale.</i>

1143
01:25:22,817 --> 01:25:26,910
<i>Bring 'em all on, every last one of
'em so I can light 'em up and lay waste...</i>

1144
01:25:35,210 --> 01:25:39,084
<i>'Cause I've been waiting for
this... for a long fucking time.</i>

1145
01:25:43,043 --> 01:25:44,075
Maybe too long.

1146
01:25:55,365 --> 01:25:58,311
<i>I mean... you know,
I don't have all day.</i>

1147
01:26:59,257 --> 01:27:00,266
<i>Hey, Brett!</i>

1148
01:27:16,110 --> 01:27:17,181
You came for me.

1149
01:27:18,541 --> 01:27:19,621
You did it.

1150
01:27:21,089 --> 01:27:22,404
You came for me.

1151
01:27:26,325 --> 01:27:27,952
How many times did it take?

1152
01:27:28,655 --> 01:27:29,655
Just one.

1153
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:34,824
We don't have
much time. Come on.

1154
01:27:36,910 --> 01:27:39,750
I couldn't tell you. They were
watching me, monitoring me.

1155
01:27:40,157 --> 01:27:42,165
I had to sneak
around the lab all night.

1156
01:27:42,451 --> 01:27:45,502
- I barely got that book to you.
- It was just enough.

1157
01:27:50,386 --> 01:27:52,425
I think Ventor
sent men after Joe.

1158
01:27:53,217 --> 01:27:55,595
There's no one left.
They're all gone, Jemma.

1159
01:27:58,223 --> 01:27:59,266
Joe's fine.

1160
01:28:00,211 --> 01:28:03,136
He's skipping school for a
gamer con, but he's okay.

1161
01:28:03,979 --> 01:28:05,263
How do you know that?

1162
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:13,321
He's got a crush, on a girl
in his class named Camille.

1163
01:28:13,576 --> 01:28:15,991
He showed her all the
bus routes to school,

1164
01:28:16,015 --> 01:28:18,326
but he's afraid to ask
her to be his girlfriend.

1165
01:28:20,517 --> 01:28:23,091
He and his friend Wyatt,
they lied about their age

1166
01:28:23,138 --> 01:28:26,510
a couple of weeks ago to
enter a... paintball tournament.

1167
01:28:26,682 --> 01:28:28,711
You asked him about
a welt on his neck.

1168
01:28:29,175 --> 01:28:31,157
He said he got
it from a bug bite.

1169
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:38,138
He, um.. he fractured his
wrist last month, skateboarding.

1170
01:28:38,437 --> 01:28:40,375
And now it makes this weird...

1171
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,750
- funny.. clicking sound.
- Clicking sound...

1172
01:28:44,352 --> 01:28:47,117
He loves dogs, especially pugs.

1173
01:28:47,998 --> 01:28:50,025
And he thinks you
two should rescue one.

1174
01:28:51,896 --> 01:28:55,649
He did a watercolor version
of Van Gogh's 'Starry Night',

1175
01:28:56,019 --> 01:28:57,822
about a year ago, for
your birthday, because

1176
01:28:57,834 --> 01:28:59,443
he knew it was your
favourite painting.

1177
01:29:01,870 --> 01:29:05,332
He thinks Mom works too
much. Doesn't smile enough

1178
01:29:08,921 --> 01:29:11,095
Oh, but that boy
loves you so much.

1179
01:29:16,801 --> 01:29:18,678
How do I stop this, Jemma?

1180
01:29:23,619 --> 01:29:27,312
Not about stopping,
Roy. It's about restarting.

1181
01:29:29,606 --> 01:29:34,694
I made your dimensions, your DNA specific
to the missing mass within the Spindle.

1182
01:29:35,103 --> 01:29:36,198
What does that mean?

1183
01:29:36,292 --> 01:29:40,825
It means you have to enter the
Spindle's core, then, theoretically...

1184
01:29:41,493 --> 01:29:45,830
the time-space continuum
should reset and resume.

1185
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:47,640
Theoretically?

1186
01:29:49,221 --> 01:29:50,221
I don't know.

1187
01:29:50,826 --> 01:29:53,798
I honestly don't, Roy. I
mean, this whole thing's just

1188
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:56,356
so cobbled together. I was
just trying to stop Ventor.

1189
01:29:56,690 --> 01:29:59,372
I didn't even know it
worked until you showed up.

1190
01:30:00,368 --> 01:30:03,974
You have to remember,
I just saw you yesterday.

1191
01:30:04,933 --> 01:30:07,310
And I haven't
seen you in forever.

1192
01:30:10,079 --> 01:30:13,074
I didn't know what else
to do, where else to turn.

1193
01:30:16,028 --> 01:30:19,864
I just knew... the
man you were, Roy

1194
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,701
I know the man you are.

1195
01:30:25,586 --> 01:30:28,581
But I don't know - what will
happen to you if you go in there.

1196
01:30:32,326 --> 01:30:34,296
I know what happens if I don't.

1197
01:30:40,431 --> 01:30:42,929
You saw it? The
end of the world?

1198
01:30:43,186 --> 01:30:44,304
Yeah.

1199
01:30:47,005 --> 01:30:48,232
What's it like?

1200
01:30:50,246 --> 01:30:52,853
It was everything
you imagine it to be...

1201
01:30:53,342 --> 01:30:54,983
only a million times worse.

1202
01:30:59,946 --> 01:31:02,310
Will it go forward? If I...

1203
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:06,661
walk through this thing, is it gonna
reset? Are you and Joe gonna be safe?

1204
01:31:08,413 --> 01:31:11,374
If you return your mass
to the core, it should.

1208
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,801

tell me you love me.

1209
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:34,058

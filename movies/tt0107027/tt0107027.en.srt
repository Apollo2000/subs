1
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,633
What's wrong? You all right?

2
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,604
What's the matter? Are you okay?

3
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,265
Nami!

4
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,742
Nami!

5
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:13,619
- Nami!
- Oh, Grandfather!

6
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,651
What's the matter with you,
my child?

7
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,119
A monster!

8
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,588
A monster will set fire to the city...

9
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,660
...and trample on the people
who try to run away.

10
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,325
A monster?

11
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,062
Then the old man and girl
are descendants...

12
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:29,895
...of the royal family of Azumi.

13
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,798
You're well-informed, brother.

14
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:35,463
I ought to know. I've been working
on the marina for a year.

15
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,304
I'm almost an Okinawan by now.

16
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,973
Anyway, her prediction scares me.

17
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,752
This is the entrance
to the Gyokusen Cave.

18
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,987
I won't go inside with you.
I've got some work to do.

19
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,428
All right, thank you.

20
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,663
See you.

21
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,780
Oh, it's Shimizu.

22
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,286
- Shimizu, we've been waiting for you.
- What's wrong?

23
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,087
We've uncovered a cave.

24
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,991
A cave?

25
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,496
Here it is.

26
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,283
Just let us in!

27
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:12,522
I told you to keep out
until the investigation is over.

28
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:15,690
- Hey, miss! You can't come in here.
- Hey, you!

29
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:18,928
I told you, reporters aren't allowed.
So stay back.

30
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,198
Reporter?

31
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,437
What's so funny?

32
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:30,048
I'm an investigator from
the archaeology department.

33
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,610
You are?

34
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,117
Lmagine...

35
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,751
...the ancient people of Okinawa
painted this mural.

36
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:43,691
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

37
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,599
This part here is a mountain
floating in the sky.

38
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,663
There are two suns.

39
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,069
I wonder what this could mean.

40
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,910
I don't understand.

41
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,877
Could be demons.

42
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,608
It looks like...

43
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,685
...a prophecy of some sort.

44
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,412
A prophecy?

45
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,684
Come and look at this.

46
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,785
This one looks like one of them.

47
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,931
- Do you know what it is?
- Probably...

48
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,090
...the guardian of the Azumis.
He's called King Caesar.

49
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,065
King Caesar?

50
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:29,238
There is a legend
among the Azumis.

51
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,906
It's handed down by tradition.

52
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,411
Long ago, when people
from the mainland...

53
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,572
...came to conquer Okinawa...

54
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,581
...a huge, brown monster appeared...

55
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,812
...and saved the royal family
of the Azumis.

56
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,125
The monster's name
was King Caesar.

57
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,892
When a black mountain...

58
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,096
...appears above the clouds...

59
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:07,144
...a monster will destroy the world.

60
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,922
Mr. Shimizu.

61
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,860
- Hi.
- Going to Tokyo too?

62
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,090
It's my first vacation in years.
How about you?

63
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,234
I'm taking this.

64
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,999
I have deciphered
the wall paintings...

65
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,742
...but I can't solve
the mystery of this statue.

66
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:52,610
So I'm gonna ask Professor Wagura
of Johoku University for help.

67
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,650
Professor Wagura?

68
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,549
I've heard of him.

69
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,747
Isn't the professor
a famous archaeologist?

70
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:04,323
Yes, he is the same.
And who are you?

71
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,397
I'm a freelance reporter.

72
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,728
But you could call me
a scandal hunter.

73
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,965
Well, let me explain.

74
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,131
I'm interested in the statue
you found too.

75
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:20,078
If I can get a scoop,
I'll make a lot of money.

76
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,976
So I hope you'll help me.

77
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,347
What is it?

78
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,389
The clouds look just like
a black mountain.

79
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,828
Yes. "When a black mountain
appears above the clouds...

80
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:43,492
...a huge monster will come forth
and try to destroy the world."

81
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:48,972
- It's from the prophecy on the mural.
- Mural?

82
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:54,067
The prophecy continues
something like this:

83
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:59,206
"But when red moon sets
and the sun rises west...

84
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:03,583
...two monsters will appear
to save the people."

85
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,720
A monster!

86
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,884
A monster will set fire to the city...

87
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,656
...and trample on the people
who try to run away.

88
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,683
Thank you for bringing me
from the airport. I'm grateful.

89
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,429
There you are.

90
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,763
Hey there, you're not invited.

91
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,736
Hold it!

92
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,469
Oh, Keisuke, welcome home.

93
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:04,411
Hello. I've brought a guest for you.

94
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,313
Well.

95
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:15,322
You're mean. You should have told me
Professor Wagura was your uncle.

96
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:18,486
Sorry, I couldn't resist
making fun of you.

97
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,395
You should be ashamed.

98
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,932
By the way, where is Masahiko?

99
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:26,333
Seems that he found
a strange piece of metal...

100
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,803
...in the Gyokusen Cave
in Okinawa.

101
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,908
He took it to Professor Miyajima.

102
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,657
This material can only be
space titanium.

103
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,386
Space titanium?

104
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,821
You mean it's from outer space?

105
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,467
Earthquake!

106
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:13,048
Every day for the last 10 days,
right, Father?

107
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,391
Earthquakes continue to be
in the news today.

108
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,332
A magnitude 2 tremor...

109
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,597
...occurred near Cape Nemuro,
Hokkaido.

110
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,537
The center has moved south
towards Tohoku...

111
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,611
...and is continuing
in a southward direction.

112
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:44,640
The cause of this moving epicenter
is still unknown.

113
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:49,447
There are those that say a huge
living being is moving underground.

114
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,102
Let's see.

115
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,432
It's difficult to read.

116
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,279
But I think it's rather familiar.

117
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,010
Professor, you'd better
get some sleep now.

118
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:22,483
No, I'm all right.

119
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:27,584
- Say, would you get me some coffee?
- Sure.

120
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,159
- Make it strong.
- Yes.

121
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,339
I want the statue.

122
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,231
Professor!

123
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,201
- Get out!
- Right!

124
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,067
You all right?

125
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,401
Are you all right?

126
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,633
Professor, it's Godzilla!

127
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:16,044
"When a black mountain
appears above the clouds...

128
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:21,022
...a huge monster will arrive
to try and destroy the world."

129
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,691
The ancient prophecy
is coming true.

130
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,925
I would never have guessed
that the monster could be Godzilla.

131
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,365
Uncle, I must be going.

132
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,732
- Where are you going?
- To Mount Fuji.

133
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,965
I'm worried about Masahiko
and the professor.

134
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,666
It's too dangerous.
The area is a battlefield.

135
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,778
Never mind.
I'll get there somehow.

136
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,040
Nami!

137
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,741
- What's the matter, Grandfather?
- The monster!

138
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,289
As you prophesized, Godzilla has
appeared on the mainland.

139
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,429
Only one thing can defeat Godzilla...

140
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:01,088
...and that is our own King Caesar!

141
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:08,033
But nobody can find the key
to unlock the divine monster.

142
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,268
Oh, Godzilla!

143
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:14,037
Destroy the people of Japan...

144
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,773
...who once tried to conquer
the Azumi tribe.

145
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:20,282
You will be the instrument
of our revenge!

146
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,318
Oh, Godzilla!

147
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,660
Something's wrong.

148
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:42,800
Anguirus shouldn't
attack his friend Godzilla.

149
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:20,955
Damn it.

150
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,277
I am positive.

151
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:52,651
It's the same metal as the piece
Masahiko found in Okinawa.

152
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,418
This is space titanium.

153
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:59,394
You're right, it is the same metal.

154
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,230
- Masahiko.
- Yes.

155
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:07,200
I want you to take me
to the cave one of these days.

156
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:08,634
Sure.

157
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,799
I wanna get a closer look at Godzilla.
Like to come along?

158
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:14,104
Of course. We'd be glad
to come with you.

159
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,945
That's a strange pipe.

160
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:20,914
Yes, I made it myself.

161
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,655
The bowl's metal includes a???

162
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:28,623
If you separate it in this way,
magnetic waves will develop...

163
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,523
...that destroy the positive
and negative electrodes.

164
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,924
Come here.

165
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,694
Look at this.

166
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:39,166
See the effect that it creates now.

167
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,238
It's a powerful pipe.

168
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,728
Two Godzillas?
What does it mean?

169
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:31,210
I didn't expect the real Godzilla
to appear so soon.

170
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:34,375
The Earth-people
must be astonished.

171
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,363
Now I get it.

172
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:27,603
The one that came out
of Mount Fuji is a cyborg.

173
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:29,637
Cyborg?

174
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,368
It is made out of the space metal.

175
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,145
You could call it a Mechagodzilla.

176
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:39,949
I see. That's Anguirus,
come out to call for Godzilla.

177
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,673
Damn Godzilla.

178
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,507
You're mistaken
if you think your powers...

179
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,514
...are a match for Mechagodzilla.

180
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:36,635
Now...

181
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:36,431
Mechagodzilla's head control
is out of order.

182
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,126
We can't continue the operation.

183
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,099
Damn it.

184
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:44,173
We'll have to postpone
our attack on Tokyo.

185
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,000
Bring Mechagodzilla back
to the base for repairs.

186
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,907
Yes, sir.

187
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,456
- Masahiko.
- Sir.

188
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,363
First thing in the morning,
we'll fly to Okinawa.

189
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:16,439
I'm sure that Mechagodzilla is being
remotely controlled by a spaceman.

190
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:19,839
The space metal is the evidence.

191
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:23,947
I have a feeling we'll find something
in Gyokusen Cave.

192
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,307
Chief, the repairs are gonna
take a long time.

193
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:59,248
Chief, if we lose too much time,
headquarters will discover our mistake.

194
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,317
Don't worry about it.

195
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:04,353
We'll use an earthman
that knows space technology.

196
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,053
I got it now!

197
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:11,320
These tattooed characters here...

198
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,693
...are an example of the ancient type
of hieroglyphic writing...

199
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:21,803
...used thousands of years ago
by the Azumi royal family.

200
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,270
They tell us where
King Caesar is sleeping.

201
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,673
What does it say?

202
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:31,806
"When the sun rises in the west...

203
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:35,441
...then place this statue
on the sacred shrine...

204
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,078
...above the gate of Azumi Castle."

205
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:43,360
The sacred shrine, Azumi Castle.

206
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:46,160
That's strange.

207
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,797
"When the red moon sets
and the sun rises in the west...

208
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,171
...two monsters will arise
to save the people."

209
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,942
- That's the prophecy on the mural.
- Right.

210
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:06,878
"The sun rises in the west..."

211
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:09,645
That's impossible.

212
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,188
What could it mean?

213
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,188
Tell agent number one...

214
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:17,988
...to steal the statue of King Caesar
as soon as possible.

215
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,687
Now that they've solved
the puzzle of the statue...

216
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:22,696
...the monster could wake up
any time.

217
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:26,064
We'll be in trouble if King Caesar
brings other monsters to life.

218
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:37,070
Those spacemen will never guess...

219
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:40,615
...we're taking the Queen Coral
to Okinawa.

220
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:43,276
They'd never guess.

221
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:16,348
Hey, look.

222
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:25,428
- Is it much farther?
- Straight ahead.

223
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:31,932
- Ikuko, watch your step, now.
- Right.

224
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,932
We have been waiting for you,
professor.

225
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,203
What's this? Who are you?

226
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,107
Commander for conquest of Earth...

227
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,443
...from the third planet
of the black hole, outer space.

228
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,450
So I was right. You are spacemen.

229
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,181
I admire your deductive processes.

230
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:30,418
This huge Mechagodzilla is our
ultimate weapon to conquer Earth...

231
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,223
...but its head controls
have gone out of order.

232
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,427
Unless we repair it quickly...

233
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,330
...our schedule of conquest
will be delayed.

234
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,596
So we thought...

235
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,439
...you'd give us the use
of the expertise...

236
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:47,976
...that succeeded in winning you
the Nobel Prize.

237
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,580
- I refuse.
- Dr. Miyajima...

238
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:56,885
...Mechagodzilla is a cyborg
that our scientists created...

239
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:59,716
...after careful study
of the original Godzilla.

240
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:02,621
Doesn't it make your mouth water?

241
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:07,224
I think you'll agree that
it's an interesting object.

242
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,401
- What is this?
- Just stay where you are.

243
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:15,903
Oh, Father!

244
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:19,105
Lkuko!

245
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,937
Professor.

246
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,408
Father!

247
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,846
Where are you taking her?

248
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,577
What is this?

249
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,245
The execution room.

250
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,693
Now...

251
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,659
...you still have time to save them.

252
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:05,950
I wonder how
Professor Miyajima is doing.

253
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,420
I hope they find some clues.

254
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:15,957
- Is there something wrong?
- Yeah.

255
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:18,897
I believe someone is watching us.

256
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:23,605
You sure?

257
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,276
What's the matter?

258
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,078
I thought I heard Godzilla just now.

259
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:17,220
I don't hear anything.

260
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:21,422
You're right, but I could swear
that I did hear it.

261
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,094
Tell me why you stole the statue!

262
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:45,292
Talk! What for?

263
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,897
Keisuke!

264
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:32,527
The statue's gone!
Somebody must have stolen it!

265
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:37,364
I was chasing the thief.
He went overboard.

266
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:41,376
Was the statue with him?

267
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,207
I'm worried about
the way that he fell.

268
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:49,011
Why's that?

269
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:52,386
It was like somebody shot him.

270
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:56,020
You're hurt.

271
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,089
Hey.

272
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:07,197
On a beautiful night like this,
you should talk about love.

273
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:37,264
- Here.
- Thank you very much, captain.

274
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:40,494
You said that it was important,
so I looked in the safe.

275
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:43,936
- I'm sorry to have troubled you.
- It's nothing. How was the trip?

276
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,770
- Wonderful.
- Glad you liked it.

277
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:49,970
I'm sure you will enjoy
your holiday trip in Okinawa.

278
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:53,947
You have been making a fool of me.
The stolen statue was a fake.

279
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:56,814
What friends don't know,
enemies won't know.

280
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:37,293
Mr. Masahiko Shimizu hasn't returned
for several days now.

281
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,656
- Hasn't returned?
- No.

282
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,923
What about Dr. Miyajima
and his daughter?

283
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:45,933
Yes, he said he might not be able
to come back for a couple of days.

284
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:49,664
That was the last time I saw them.
We're very worried about them both.

285
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:52,003
Is that so?

286
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,014
You're finished already?

287
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:15,282
I thank you.
Now, come down here, please.

288
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:36,339
Mechagodzilla will start action
at 6 in the morning.

289
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:46,447
Let's drink to the return
of Mechagodzilla and to our success.

290
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:47,749
Keep your promise.

291
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,223
Release my daughter
and the young man at once.

292
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:52,419
Why, of course, doctor.

293
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,257
I'll do it immediately.

294
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:57,324
Please.

295
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:28,356
- Professor!
- Father!

296
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:31,493
Lkuko. Masahiko.

297
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:42,574
Enjoy yourselves. This will be
the last night you will have.

298
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:47,914
Professor, we were
worried about you.

299
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:51,013
I'm all right. I'm glad you're alive.

300
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:53,816
Let us help you.

301
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:05,826
Get over here!

302
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:20,706
Damn them. They're trying
to scald us to death.

303
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:48,238
- Professor's pipe.
- That's right.

304
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,548
Who are you?

305
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:04,784
A spaceman?

306
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:09,462
Where's my brother and the
professor? Where are they?

307
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:14,562
You'll see them soon.
Rather, their corpses.

308
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,560
Just who are you?

309
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:42,357
I am an Interpol agent, Nanbara.

310
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:46,593
- Interpol?
- Yes.

311
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,103
Six months ago,
they came to our attention.

312
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:55,006
We threw out a net to find the truth.

313
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:58,312
And then you got caught in the net.

314
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:01,208
I've been following you ever since.

315
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,721
On your feet.

316
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:23,565
You'll lead us to your base.
And don't try any tricks.

317
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,137
It's hot!

318
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:00,841
I'm gonna die!

319
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,070
Don't give up.

320
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:12,286
Ikuko, don't give up.

321
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:28,133
Open it.

322
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:09,002
- Alpha.
- Centaurus.

323
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:16,177
Move.

324
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:22,809
Turn it off!

325
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,544
Masahiko.

326
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,615
Masahiko!

327
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,883
- Are you all right?
- Shimizu!

328
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:33,587
Sir, I'm glad you're alive.
Hurry, let's get out of here.

329
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,794
No one move.

330
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:42,537
Reach for the sky. Make it quick.

331
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:55,316
Get down!

332
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,012
Now, come on, hurry.

333
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:01,990
Move it!

334
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:52,740
We'll be all right.
I have my car parked outside.

335
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:57,136
Goodbye, stupid earthlings.

336
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:08,684
Hold it!

337
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:45,159
Quick thinking. That makes
three times you saved my life.

338
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:46,761
Three times?

339
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:50,764
You saved me on the boat too.
Didn't you?

340
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:56,330
Do you notice the color
of the moon?

341
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:01,066
A red moon?

342
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,203
"When the red moon sets..."

343
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:07,406
The prophecies are coming true,
one after another.

344
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:13,251
Shimizu, I'm gonna go back inside
and take care of those bastards.

345
00:58:13,423 --> 00:58:16,324
- You go to Azumi Castle.
- Right.

346
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:20,327
Please, let me help you.

347
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,826
- Well, brother? Okay with you?
- Okay.

348
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,195
I am going with you.

349
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,235
I must go.

350
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:30,895
Even though I did it
to save my daughter's life...

351
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:33,133
...I still cooperated with them.

352
00:58:33,743 --> 00:58:35,540
I have sold my soul to the devil.

353
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:37,737
But you didn't have
any choice that time.

354
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:39,939
- Don't risk your life again.
- No!

355
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:41,913
I worked on the Mechagodzilla.

356
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:44,815
I'm the only one that knows
how to destroy it.

357
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:47,115
You can see that, can't you?

358
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:53,151
I understand. By the way...

359
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:55,297
...professor...

360
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:59,401
...better take this with you.
It might be of some help.

361
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:04,534
I never thought I'd see this again.
Thanks a lot.

362
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:29,396
- How's it going?
- Ask me later. Let's go to the castle.

363
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:02,155
- Alpha.
- Centaurus.

364
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:34,787
- Is that it?
- Yes.

365
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:50,941
Give the statue to me.

366
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:54,550
If you don't hand it over,
the old man and the girl will die.

367
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,255
That bastard.

368
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:03,358
It's your fault. You brought
all this trouble upon us.

369
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:06,256
If you'd just kept
your hands off the statue...

370
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:09,660
...we would never have had
to suffer the way we have.

371
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,630
Grandfather!

372
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:16,129
Hand it over now.

373
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:22,004
Saeko, let's give it to them.

374
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:02,581
I'm Tamura, with Interpol.

375
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:06,079
- Then you're with Nanbara?
- Yes, we're partners.

376
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:09,224
We're glad to see you.

377
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,535
It's two minutes to 6.

378
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:28,709
Look at that! The sun's rising!

379
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,103
The sun's rising in the west!

380
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:45,856
So that's it.
"When the sun rises in the west..."

381
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:47,457
It meant a mirage.

382
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:54,027
It's King Caesar.

383
01:03:56,699 --> 01:04:00,157
Chief, they have freed King Caesar.

384
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,697
Our men have failed
to get the statue.

385
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:10,506
Right. King Caesar will be
our first victim.

386
01:04:12,748 --> 01:04:14,409
Get ready to launch the cyborg.

387
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:32,564
We're too late!

388
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:35,670
Okay, we can still stop it
by destroying the control room.

389
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:37,533
Right. Let's go!

390
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:06,998
Mechagodzilla, destroy King Caesar
while he's sleeping.

391
01:05:22,818 --> 01:05:24,649
It's dangerous!
Where are you going?

392
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,412
She must go.

393
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:31,417
King Caesar can only be woken up...

394
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:37,055
...by a direct descendant
of the Azumi royal family.

395
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:45,183
Mechagodzilla, destroy him quickly!

396
01:08:52,561 --> 01:08:55,587
I'm amazed that you're still alive,
professor.

397
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,527
But you must not underestimate us.

398
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,353
Come on!

399
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:32,852
Mechagodzilla is fighting very well.

400
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:36,159
Professor...

401
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:40,260
...I would like to thank you again
for your cooperation.

402
01:11:52,841 --> 01:11:54,240
Godzilla is still alive.

403
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:57,311
The other monster the ancient people
said would appear...

404
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:59,003
...must be Godzilla!

405
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:14,786
So Godzilla is still alive.

406
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:17,591
We'll have to teach it
another lesson.

407
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:23,301
Mechagodzilla,
beat Godzilla to death.

408
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:28,393
Destroy him now!

409
01:18:16,558 --> 01:18:18,753
What's wrong? Mechagodzilla!

410
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:42,540
So he's transformed himself
into a magnetic pole.

411
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:31,595
Rockets, full throttle! Retreat!

412
01:19:39,474 --> 01:19:41,101
When I give the signal...

413
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:44,370
...you throw them at both ends
of the control console.

414
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:45,939
I can't believe it.

415
01:20:46,107 --> 01:20:50,635
The magnificent machine,
Mechagodzilla, has been defeated.

416
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:31,984
- It's dangerous! Let's get out!
- Wait a moment.

417
01:22:42,324 --> 01:22:44,155
Father?

418
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:49,992
It's all right.
Your father has achieved a victory.

419
01:23:58,066 --> 01:24:01,058
Finally, the ancestors
of the Azumi royal family...

420
01:24:01,236 --> 01:24:03,966
...can now sleep in peace.

<i>Kaslan</i>

3
00:00:37,585 --> 00:00:40,952
At Kaslan,
we believe that happiness

4
00:00:40,954 --> 00:00:42,854
is about more
than entertainment.

5
00:00:42,856 --> 00:00:47,092
It's about being known,
understood, loved.

6
00:00:47,094 --> 00:00:51,399
Introducing your new
best friend, Buddi.

7
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:54,967
Hey, Buddi.
Let's watch some TV.

8
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:56,735
Okay.

9
00:00:56,737 --> 00:01:00,272
<i>Hi, I'm Buddi. I can help you
out all over the house.</i>

10
00:01:00,274 --> 00:01:02,107
Buddi can connect to
and control

11
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:05,077
all of your Kaslan products
and smart home devices.

12
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:08,781
<i>He can be your personal DJ,
help tidy up the house.</i>

13
00:01:08,783 --> 00:01:11,016
<i>Control your entire
smart hub system.</i>

14
00:01:11,018 --> 00:01:14,720
<i>Buddi uses advanced
self-learning technology</i>

15
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:16,788
<i>to constantly find new ways
to entertain you.</i>

16
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,925
Hi, Buddi.
I'm Ben, and I'm 13 years old.

17
00:01:18,927 --> 00:01:20,726
<i>Hi, Buddi. I'm Ben,</i>

18
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:22,228
<i>and I'm 13 years old.</i>

19
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,930
Don't forget
your science book.

20
00:01:23,932 --> 00:01:25,398
<i>He adapts
to your daily routine.</i>

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,933
Thanks.

22
00:01:26,935 --> 00:01:29,001
<i>And finds ways
to make life simpler</i>

23
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:31,936
<i>by connecting to a host
of Kaslan services.</i>

24
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:34,740
Thanks, Buddi. I need
a Kaslan Kar pick up, please.

25
00:01:34,742 --> 00:01:36,741
Your car is on its way!

26
00:01:36,743 --> 00:01:38,776
<i>When Buddi
imprints on you,</i>

27
00:01:38,778 --> 00:01:40,546
<i>he becomes your best friend
for life.</i>

28
00:01:40,548 --> 00:01:42,915
<i>You are my buddy</i>

29
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:46,118
<i>And Buddi's
state-of-the-art AI safeguards</i>

30
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,557
<i>ensure that your children
will always be safe.</i>

31
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:24,891
Hey!

32
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:30,916
- Hello.
- Nobody told me

33
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:33,252
the fucking doll was ginger.

34
00:04:33,254 --> 00:04:37,288
Okay, I don't think you're
allowed to say that word.

35
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,892
My kid wanted the blonde one.
You know, that one.

36
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:43,495
Yeah. So that one
is the Buddi 2,

37
00:04:43,497 --> 00:04:44,831
which hasn't come out yet.

38
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,298
And it looks like

39
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,834
you purchased the Buddi 1,
which is this guy.

40
00:04:48,836 --> 00:04:51,269
Listen, I waited
three goddamn weeks

41
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:53,105
for this ginger piece of shit
to come in the mail.

42
00:04:53,107 --> 00:04:58,043
Okay. Well, I'm so sorry
that you didn't read the box.

43
00:04:58,045 --> 00:05:00,947
And even... There's a window,
that you can see

44
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:05,216
that his hair is red
and not blonde.

45
00:05:05,218 --> 00:05:06,687
Thanks.

46
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:09,290
Thanks for shopping
at Zed Mart.

47
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:24,171
Heh.

48
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:49,894
Hi.

49
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:52,199
Hey, uh, I was just...

50
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:56,000
Whoa. You look like shit.
What happened to you?

51
00:05:56,002 --> 00:05:58,570
Thanks.
And watch your language.

52
00:05:58,572 --> 00:05:59,774
Sorry.

53
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:03,776
Andy, I told you
to unpack those boxes.

54
00:06:03,778 --> 00:06:05,045
Okay, I know, and I was.

55
00:06:05,747 --> 00:06:07,146
I wanted to make a mental map

56
00:06:07,148 --> 00:06:08,781
of where I should put
everything first.

57
00:06:08,783 --> 00:06:10,683
You know,
for maximum feng shui.

58
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:12,952
I think you were maximum
feng-shuing so hard,

59
00:06:12,954 --> 00:06:14,086
you forgot to put
your phone down

60
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:15,421
for five seconds
and feed Rooney.

61
00:06:15,423 --> 00:06:17,055
You mean this busted-ass phone

62
00:06:17,057 --> 00:06:18,558
that we're replacing
for my birthday?

63
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,392
Dude, I've already been
working doubles

64
00:06:20,394 --> 00:06:22,195
to try to get you
a new hearing aid.

65
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,262
I'm fine with this one,

66
00:06:24,264 --> 00:06:27,533
but this is my primary source
of education.

67
00:06:27,535 --> 00:06:29,569
Oh, my God. I never thought
about it like that.

68
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:31,269
Wait.

69
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:33,538
Let me see what your education
has been getting you up to.

70
00:06:36,677 --> 00:06:38,911
Oh, my God,
I cannot escape this doll.

71
00:06:38,913 --> 00:06:40,579
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.
- No.

72
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:43,815
Gross. This is staying with me
for the rest of the night.

73
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:45,416
- What? You...
- No.

74
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:47,620
You can't do that. That's
the only thing to do here.

75
00:06:47,622 --> 00:06:52,291
There's literally an entire
world of things to do.

76
00:06:52,293 --> 00:06:55,127
Look, two kids standing
in the rain. That looks fun.

77
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:57,365
They could be anybody.
They could be serial killers.

78
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,765
Noodle.

79
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:02,668
We talked about this.

80
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,901
You said you were gonna try

81
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:05,437
to make new friends.

82
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:08,009
This move is supposed to be
a new start for us.

83
00:07:08,908 --> 00:07:10,909
Tell you what,
you don't have to unpack

84
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:13,945
or do anything tonight,

85
00:07:13,947 --> 00:07:16,016
if you just go out there
and try.

86
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:18,687
Give you your phone back.

87
00:07:19,687 --> 00:07:22,090
Okay. I'll be outside.

88
00:07:22,857 --> 00:07:24,457
Really, that was it?

89
00:07:43,577 --> 00:07:45,176
<i>We picked this up
three weeks ago.</i>

90
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:46,478
But we took it home,
and we turned it on,

91
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,812
and its eyes were red.

92
00:07:47,814 --> 00:07:50,281
And something's wrong with it.

93
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:51,884
It was just weird.
And I just thought,

94
00:07:51,886 --> 00:07:53,586
with the new one
coming out in two weeks,

95
00:07:53,588 --> 00:07:56,555
it would just be better for me
to take this back, you know,

96
00:07:56,557 --> 00:07:58,089
get it off my hands.

97
00:07:58,091 --> 00:07:59,992
So, I'm just wondering,

98
00:07:59,994 --> 00:08:01,196
can I get my money back?

99
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:03,364
Yeah.

100
00:08:09,836 --> 00:08:11,038
Hey, Wes!

101
00:08:12,072 --> 00:08:13,438
- Hi.
- Hey, I was just curious.

102
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,240
Um, what happens
to returns like this?

103
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:18,678
- Oh, uh...
- Like, really damaged returns.

104
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,913
Yeah, we send it back
to Kaslan.

105
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:22,380
And what do they do with it?

106
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:23,815
Probably toss it,
trash compactor.

107
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:24,983
I don't know.
New model's coming out.

108
00:08:24,985 --> 00:08:26,084
No one's gonna
give a rat's ass

109
00:08:26,086 --> 00:08:27,519
about this thing in two weeks.

110
00:08:27,521 --> 00:08:28,954
So, they won't care
if it doesn't make it

111
00:08:28,956 --> 00:08:29,822
on the truck, right?

112
00:08:29,824 --> 00:08:31,457
I care.

113
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:33,492
Come on, my kid's birthday
is coming up. Can I have it?

114
00:08:33,494 --> 00:08:35,761
- You've got a kid?
- Yes, I've got a kid.

115
00:08:35,763 --> 00:08:38,162
I had a very productive
sweet 16, okay?

116
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:39,466
If you really wanna know.

117
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,901
Come on.

118
00:08:41,903 --> 00:08:43,370
It'll be our little secret.

119
00:08:44,004 --> 00:08:46,738
- No one has to know.
- Uh...

120
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,141
Just like that time you banged
Susan in the warehouse.

121
00:08:49,143 --> 00:08:50,743
How's your wife, by the way?

122
00:08:50,745 --> 00:08:52,710
Ha-ha.

123
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:54,714
Can I have it?
Give it to me.

124
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,052
And I'm taking it.

125
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,618
There you go, Wes.

126
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,820
Say hi to your wife.

127
00:09:01,822 --> 00:09:03,323
Yep. Mm-hmm.

128
00:09:22,076 --> 00:09:23,941
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit.

129
00:09:23,943 --> 00:09:25,777
Hey! Noodle.

130
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:27,347
You're home early.

131
00:09:29,048 --> 00:09:31,083
- Remember Shane?
- Hey, bud.

132
00:09:31,085 --> 00:09:33,118
It's been a while.

133
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,153
I'm... I'm just gonna
make dinner. You hungry?

134
00:09:35,155 --> 00:09:36,921
No. Uh, I'm gonna go hang out

135
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:38,458
with some kids
down the hall, actually.

136
00:09:39,326 --> 00:09:40,758
Really, who?

137
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,362
Gotta go. Bye!

138
00:10:02,616 --> 00:10:04,016
So, what are you?

139
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:05,950
Some kind of fourth floor
hallway hobo,

140
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:07,420
or something like that?

141
00:10:07,721 --> 00:10:09,088
What?

142
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,656
Andy, right?
You just moved into 401?

143
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:14,993
Yeah. I see you out here,
like, a lot.

144
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:18,329
Oh, uh, no, it's not me.

145
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:20,098
I have, like,
five twin brothers,

146
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,267
so we just take shifts.

147
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:24,869
Are you comin' in or what?

148
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:26,671
I'll be right there, Ma.

149
00:10:26,673 --> 00:10:28,040
Just give me a minute.

150
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:29,643
Love you.

151
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:33,277
So that's the mom.

152
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,546
She drags me over for dinner
every week.

153
00:10:35,548 --> 00:10:38,349
So, listen, man, if you
wanna have some dinner,

154
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:40,151
you're welcome to join us,
'cause I could

155
00:10:40,153 --> 00:10:41,686
really use the backup,
'cause she...

156
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:42,522
Andy?

157
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:45,426
What's going on?

158
00:10:46,126 --> 00:10:47,626
Is he in trouble?

159
00:10:47,628 --> 00:10:48,993
Yeah. Lots of trouble.

160
00:10:48,995 --> 00:10:50,363
We've been gettin'
lots of complaints about

161
00:10:50,365 --> 00:10:51,863
some kid out here
throwing parties,

162
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:54,501
selling drugs and beer.

163
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:57,204
Peddling booze... Um...

164
00:10:57,804 --> 00:10:59,405
Oh.

165
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:00,873
That was a joke?

166
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,307
It was an attempt.

167
00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:04,041
I was gonna say,
"I'm the fun police."

168
00:11:06,147 --> 00:11:07,448
It's not landing.

169
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:10,015
Wait, who are you?

170
00:11:10,017 --> 00:11:14,255
I'm Mike... Detective.
Detective Mike.

171
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:18,857
So, um, I'm just gonna go.

172
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:21,160
Yeah. I'm gonna go.

173
00:11:21,162 --> 00:11:22,927
All moms are scary,
by the way.

174
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:24,363
Hurry up, son!

175
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:25,897
It was nice to meet you,
Andy's mom.

176
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:27,299
Nice meeting you,
Detective Mike.

177
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:29,100
- Bye, Mike.
- See you later, Andy.

178
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:31,337
Dinner ain't
gonna cook itself!

179
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:34,008
You're screaming, Ma.
Really?

180
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,342
Must you embarrass me
like that?

181
00:11:36,344 --> 00:11:37,743
Ma, you can't be
shouting like that.

182
00:11:37,745 --> 00:11:39,447
I thought you were out
with your friends.

183
00:11:41,282 --> 00:11:42,781
Why didn't you just
come back inside?

184
00:11:42,783 --> 00:11:44,485
Is Shane still there?

185
00:11:45,219 --> 00:11:48,056
No. He's gone.

186
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:55,730
Come on, I've got
something for you.

187
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,499
It's a surprise.

188
00:12:00,868 --> 00:12:02,270
Close your eyes.

189
00:12:11,577 --> 00:12:12,945
Okay. Hey!

190
00:12:12,947 --> 00:12:15,147
I know it's not your birthday
for a couple weeks,

191
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:17,382
but this move
has been really tough.

192
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:20,085
And I know
you're kinda mad at me,

193
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:21,453
so I think you deserve this.

194
00:12:21,455 --> 00:12:24,057
Surprise!
Early present.

195
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:39,771
Is that a sigh?

196
00:12:39,773 --> 00:12:41,373
That's the Buddi thing
you're obsessed with.

197
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,343
Yeah, um, it's just...

198
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:46,445
This thing is for, like,
little kids now.

199
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:48,079
It came out, like, a year ago.

200
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:50,848
Okay, I know it's stupid,
but I thought it'd be funny.

201
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,952
Come on!

202
00:12:52,486 --> 00:12:54,652
- Let's try it.
- Okay.

203
00:12:54,654 --> 00:12:56,555
Just remember,
it's refurbished,

204
00:12:56,557 --> 00:12:59,192
so it might not work
perfectly, okay?

205
00:13:07,802 --> 00:13:09,134
<i>Your Buddi is now connected.</i>

206
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:10,337
Whoa.

207
00:13:13,173 --> 00:13:14,608
Cool.

208
00:13:21,315 --> 00:13:24,552
Hi.
Are you my best buddy?

209
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:27,522
I guess?

210
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:33,191
<i>That's bright.</i>

211
00:13:33,193 --> 00:13:34,859
What's your name?

212
00:13:34,861 --> 00:13:36,996
Andy. 'Sup?

213
00:13:36,998 --> 00:13:38,397
Hi, Andysup.

214
00:13:40,768 --> 00:13:42,769
- Sorry.
- What's my name?

215
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:45,640
Um...

216
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,706
Han Solo.

217
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,975
Did you say Chucky?

218
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:54,045
What? No.
Not even close.

219
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,647
- Chucky.
- It's...

220
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:56,714
I like that.

221
00:13:56,716 --> 00:13:58,850
Chucky.

222
00:13:58,852 --> 00:14:00,319
I'm Chucky.

223
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:02,353
What do you wanna do, Andysup?

224
00:14:02,355 --> 00:14:04,824
Andy. It's just Andy.

225
00:14:04,826 --> 00:14:08,026
Um, I don't know.
Do something cool.

226
00:14:08,028 --> 00:14:10,462
I guess turn on the TV.

227
00:14:10,464 --> 00:14:11,930
<i>I will do that.</i>

228
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:13,199
What's a TV?

229
00:14:13,201 --> 00:14:15,334
Are you joking?
That thing.

230
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:17,368
I cannot process that command.

231
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,502
<i>Oh, wait a minute.</i>

232
00:14:18,504 --> 00:14:19,738
<i>It says here you gotta</i>

233
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,674
"sync his knowledge base
to the cloud

234
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:25,278
"before he can connect to
any other Kaslan products."

235
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,277
<i>Okay, Chucky,</i>

236
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,479
connect to the cloud.

237
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:30,348
Download.

238
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:33,218
Learn stuff.

239
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:37,757
I am unable to do that.

240
00:14:43,196 --> 00:14:44,764
<i>It's kinda creepy.</i>

241
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:47,632
Doesn't work.

242
00:14:47,634 --> 00:14:48,600
God.

243
00:14:48,602 --> 00:14:50,603
Okay, this thing is stupid.

244
00:14:50,605 --> 00:14:52,237
I didn't know
it was that messed up.

245
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:53,604
- No, Mom.
- I'll take it back. It's fine.

246
00:14:53,606 --> 00:14:55,840
Mom. Mom, honestly, I like it.

247
00:14:55,842 --> 00:14:58,611
- No, you don't.
- Seriously. It's great.

248
00:14:58,613 --> 00:14:59,780
He's hilarious.

249
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:02,547
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

250
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:04,215
It's actually
pretty cool.

251
00:15:04,217 --> 00:15:06,253
Go to bed, Andysup.

252
00:15:07,788 --> 00:15:09,653
Come on.

253
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:19,730
This is my room.

254
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:24,435
And that's Mickey Rooney.

255
00:15:24,437 --> 00:15:29,174
He's a total dick,
so just don't touch him.

256
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:31,075
Total dick.

257
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:33,012
Whoa.

258
00:15:33,014 --> 00:15:34,715
You're allowed to say that?

259
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,750
Cool.

260
00:15:37,118 --> 00:15:38,416
Uh...

261
00:15:38,418 --> 00:15:40,420
This is my desk.

262
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:45,290
This is my sketchbook.

263
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:49,294
I do fake buddy cop
team-ups sometimes.

264
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:50,764
Like, Dracula and Robin Hood.

265
00:15:50,998 --> 00:15:52,297
Or...

266
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:54,701
This one's Zorro and Medusa.

267
00:15:55,168 --> 00:15:57,502
Kind of a deep cut.

268
00:15:57,504 --> 00:15:59,774
I don't know, it's stupid.

269
00:16:00,508 --> 00:16:03,141
I do not think it's stupid.

270
00:16:03,143 --> 00:16:04,609
Thanks.

271
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:06,945
Pity compliments
from a talking doll.

272
00:16:06,947 --> 00:16:07,748
That's my life.

273
00:16:09,616 --> 00:16:12,352
Uh... That's enough
for tonight.

274
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:17,890
Do you want to sing
the Buddi song before bed?

275
00:16:17,892 --> 00:16:20,459
No. Uh, I'm good.

276
00:16:20,461 --> 00:16:24,829
<i>You are my buddy
until the end</i>

277
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:30,471
<i>More than a buddy,
you're my best friend</i>

278
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:38,343
Right.
Totally not weird at all.

279
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:40,179
Are we having fun now?

280
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:42,747
Sure. Uh, I guess.

281
00:16:42,749 --> 00:16:43,985
Yay!

282
00:16:46,086 --> 00:16:47,788
Okay.

283
00:17:00,868 --> 00:17:04,869
Is it time to play again?
Are we having fun now?

284
00:17:04,871 --> 00:17:07,508
No. We're having sleep.

285
00:17:12,113 --> 00:17:15,816
Just please close your eyes
and pretend to be less creepy.

286
00:17:23,057 --> 00:17:26,059
You're my
best friend, Andy.

287
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:31,699
Okay. Stop being so weird.
Quiet time.

288
00:17:36,236 --> 00:17:38,737
<i>You are my buddy</i>

289
00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:41,273
<i>Until the end</i>

290
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:46,480
<i>More than a buddy,
you're my best friend</i>

291
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:53,485
<i>I love you more
than you will ever know</i>

292
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:56,455
- <i>I will never...</i>
- Please shut up.

293
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:58,859
<i>...let you go</i>

294
00:18:01,461 --> 00:18:03,330
Good night, Andy.

295
00:18:36,329 --> 00:18:39,498
Andy,
you forgot your science book.

296
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:45,636
Okay, Chucky,
this is not a book.

297
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:47,841
None of these are books.

298
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:53,381
Just stay here, okay?

299
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,550
And no more books.

300
00:19:11,463 --> 00:19:13,067
- You're back!
- Jesus!

301
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:14,634
Whoa!

302
00:19:15,836 --> 00:19:17,137
Were you here the whole time?

303
00:19:18,538 --> 00:19:20,907
I made you a present.

304
00:19:24,577 --> 00:19:26,978
- A busted stick.
- Andy.

305
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,981
Shh.

306
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:36,889
I don't get
what she sees in Shane.

307
00:19:36,891 --> 00:19:38,657
I mean,

308
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:39,860
he's not nice.

309
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:44,595
He's just an asshole.

310
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:47,968
It doesn't matter anyway.

311
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,972
He's just gonna end up
leaving us,

312
00:19:53,773 --> 00:19:56,074
like everybody else.

313
00:19:56,076 --> 00:19:58,578
I will never leave you.

314
00:20:05,318 --> 00:20:07,552
Are we having fun now?

315
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:09,953
Yeah. I guess.

316
00:20:09,955 --> 00:20:13,225
Attack? You shouldn't lead
with your chieftain.

317
00:20:13,227 --> 00:20:16,961
I still have to teach you
so much about this. Okay...

318
00:20:16,963 --> 00:20:17,998
Um...

319
00:20:30,243 --> 00:20:34,645
Okay. And I get
to roll again. So...

320
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:36,815
Boom! Double sixes!

321
00:20:36,817 --> 00:20:38,316
Okay, get that orc outta here.

322
00:20:38,318 --> 00:20:40,318
Total dick.

323
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,054
Nailed that one.

324
00:20:42,455 --> 00:20:43,923
Ow!

325
00:20:48,795 --> 00:20:51,296
- What is that?
- The cat scratched me.

326
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:52,532
Hurts like hell.

327
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:56,500
Kitty hurt Andy?

328
00:20:56,502 --> 00:20:59,240
Uh, yeah. Stay here.
I'm gonna go find a Band-Aid.

329
00:21:00,272 --> 00:21:01,241
Stupid Rooney.

330
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:06,246
I swear,
I'm so sick of this cat.

331
00:21:18,224 --> 00:21:20,191
Rooney, I swear to God,
if you don't shut up,

332
00:21:20,193 --> 00:21:22,626
I'm putting you back
on dry food.

333
00:21:24,498 --> 00:21:25,699
Chucky! Stop!

334
00:21:29,102 --> 00:21:32,236
You can't do that, okay?
Why would you do that?

335
00:21:32,238 --> 00:21:36,076
He was hurting you.
He was making you unhappy.

336
00:21:39,144 --> 00:21:42,881
Chucky, okay, listen,
look at me.

337
00:21:42,883 --> 00:21:44,748
This is important.

338
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,353
You can't hurt people,
or cats.

339
00:21:48,355 --> 00:21:49,653
It's not cool.

340
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:51,722
I know you're different,

341
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:54,025
but that's gotta be
our secret. Okay?

342
00:21:54,027 --> 00:21:57,328
And don't say any weird shit
or creep people out.

343
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:00,099
Hey! Cat's freakin' out.

344
00:22:02,536 --> 00:22:04,004
Clean up this room.

345
00:22:05,605 --> 00:22:06,774
Except maybe that guy.

346
00:22:10,576 --> 00:22:12,112
I've got an idea.

347
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,380
Okay. If this is gonna work,

348
00:22:15,382 --> 00:22:17,547
I need you to look as creepy

349
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:21,384
and scary and angry and mean
as possible. All right?

350
00:22:21,386 --> 00:22:25,259
So, open your eyes
as wide as you can, like...

351
00:22:27,294 --> 00:22:28,927
No, you still look cute.

352
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:31,062
Open your mouth
as wide as you can

353
00:22:31,064 --> 00:22:33,297
and snarl with your lips.

354
00:22:34,468 --> 00:22:35,603
But kinda smile.

355
00:22:36,736 --> 00:22:38,936
Perfect!
Okay, yes, just like that.

356
00:22:38,938 --> 00:22:40,771
Okay. Try this one.

357
00:22:40,773 --> 00:22:42,175
Smile as wide as you can.

358
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:44,144
Wider.

359
00:22:45,211 --> 00:22:46,646
Yes!

360
00:22:47,114 --> 00:22:48,979
Yeah, uh...

361
00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:51,050
It's actually
pretty damn creepy.

362
00:22:52,484 --> 00:22:54,384
Okay, you can stop now.

363
00:22:56,022 --> 00:22:57,555
- Franklin! Franklin!
- Ah...

364
00:22:57,557 --> 00:22:59,390
Shit. Sorry.

365
00:22:59,392 --> 00:23:00,525
It's fine.

366
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,932
It's fucking loud.

367
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:08,167
It's fucking loud.

368
00:23:10,403 --> 00:23:11,769
That thing just swore.

369
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:13,037
It... It's not supposed
to be able to do that.

370
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,107
Uh, yeah. I know. He, uh...

371
00:23:16,109 --> 00:23:17,909
It doesn't really
follow the rules.

372
00:23:17,911 --> 00:23:20,510
It doesn't follow the rules?

373
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:21,779
Like it has a choice?

374
00:23:21,781 --> 00:23:23,980
Kinda, yeah.

375
00:23:23,982 --> 00:23:27,017
Sorry, can I pop in here?
So he just does whatever?

376
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:28,819
You can make him do whatever?

377
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:30,322
Pretty much.

378
00:23:30,324 --> 00:23:32,123
Okay, can I just point out
that this is how

379
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,193
every robot apocalypse
scenario begins?

380
00:23:35,662 --> 00:23:38,196
- Say "dick cheese."
- Dick cheese.

381
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:41,132
That is the coolest.

382
00:23:41,134 --> 00:23:42,767
I have so many
questions. Uh, who are you?

383
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:44,969
His name is Andysup.

384
00:23:44,971 --> 00:23:47,875
- I'm Andy.
- Falyn. Pugg.

385
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:51,109
Why are you in the hall?

386
00:23:51,111 --> 00:23:52,943
Uh, I was gonna try
and teach him

387
00:23:52,945 --> 00:23:54,845
to creep out
my mom's boyfriend,

388
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:56,413
but probably a bad idea.

389
00:23:56,415 --> 00:23:58,182
You're wrong.
It's perfect.

390
00:23:58,184 --> 00:24:00,721
And we're doing it right now.

391
00:24:19,006 --> 00:24:22,076
Jesus! Fuck! Fuckin'...

392
00:24:25,244 --> 00:24:26,443
Karen!

393
00:24:26,445 --> 00:24:28,144
- <i>Karen!</i>
- Oh, check it out.

394
00:24:28,146 --> 00:24:29,982
- Look at that.
- Oh, my God.

395
00:24:30,884 --> 00:24:32,651
This is legendary.

396
00:24:36,689 --> 00:24:37,755
- Hey!
- Hi!

397
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:38,922
We're here for Andy.

398
00:24:38,924 --> 00:24:40,491
Let's move, dick turd.

399
00:24:40,493 --> 00:24:42,826
- Who are you?
- Falyn and Pugg.

400
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:44,327
Those are names?
Falyn and Pugg?

401
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:46,564
- Hey. Ready?
- Yeah. Be back later!

402
00:24:46,566 --> 00:24:48,699
- Your sister's pretty hot.
- Dude, that's my mom.

403
00:24:48,701 --> 00:24:50,403
Heh. Even hotter.

404
00:25:16,028 --> 00:25:17,327
You sure the janitor guy

405
00:25:17,329 --> 00:25:19,029
is not gonna get
any shit for this?

406
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:21,432
Who cares?
Guy's a total creep.

407
00:25:21,434 --> 00:25:23,934
Is that thing busted?
It's kinda weird looking.

408
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:25,972
No. He's just different.

409
00:25:29,643 --> 00:25:32,209
Now say, "This is for Tupac!"

410
00:25:32,211 --> 00:25:34,245
Do you wanna sing
the Buddi song?

411
00:25:34,247 --> 00:25:36,914
No! Say, "This is for Tupac,"
and stab the asshole.

412
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:38,382
- Come on!
- But I want to.

413
00:25:38,384 --> 00:25:40,517
We want this
to go viral. He for real?

414
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:42,519
<i>You are my buddy...</i>

415
00:25:42,521 --> 00:25:44,956
That's enough.
Time to go, Chucky.

416
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:46,160
Narc alert. Shut up, shut up.

417
00:25:48,227 --> 00:25:50,928
Narc alert. Shut up, shut up.

418
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,963
I just got owned.

419
00:25:54,634 --> 00:25:56,804
Little fucking millennials.

420
00:26:02,942 --> 00:26:04,808
Andy, you wanna play now?

421
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,677
Not now, Chucky.

422
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:07,978
This is ridiculous.

423
00:26:11,417 --> 00:26:12,949
Wait for it.

424
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:14,421
Wait for it...

425
00:26:15,255 --> 00:26:18,221
<i>Time for incoming mail!</i>

426
00:26:18,223 --> 00:26:20,190
<i>One, and a-two...</i>

427
00:26:20,192 --> 00:26:21,394
- Heads up, bitch!
- <i>...and a-three!</i>

428
00:26:21,862 --> 00:26:23,228
Boom!

429
00:26:25,865 --> 00:26:26,933
Yes!

430
00:26:31,104 --> 00:26:32,439
Did you see that?

431
00:26:51,423 --> 00:26:53,592
What the hell?
What even is that?

432
00:26:53,594 --> 00:26:56,026
I don't know,
I bought it at a store.

433
00:26:56,028 --> 00:26:57,461
It's so unrealistic.

434
00:26:57,463 --> 00:26:58,662
And specific.

435
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:03,334
Are all horror movies
like this?

436
00:27:03,336 --> 00:27:04,803
- No.
- Pretty much.

437
00:27:04,805 --> 00:27:06,536
- Yes, they are.
- No, they're not.

438
00:27:08,842 --> 00:27:11,209
Oh. Gross.
Is that his face?

439
00:27:11,211 --> 00:27:13,279
What the hell?

440
00:27:14,047 --> 00:27:15,345
Are you fucking watching this?

441
00:27:15,347 --> 00:27:17,114
That wouldn't even happen.

442
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,420
Heads up, bitch.

443
00:27:22,422 --> 00:27:23,423
Andy.

444
00:27:25,392 --> 00:27:27,357
<i>Wait for it.</i>

445
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:29,227
That is priceless.

446
00:27:29,229 --> 00:27:30,761
Heads up, bitch.
Heads up, bitch.

447
00:27:30,763 --> 00:27:33,029
Chucky? Put down the knife.

448
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:34,367
- Heads up, bitch.
- Andy!

449
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:35,903
Chucky!

450
00:27:36,536 --> 00:27:38,370
Stop!

451
00:27:41,607 --> 00:27:42,740
What is wrong with you?

452
00:27:42,742 --> 00:27:44,875
I, uh...

453
00:27:44,877 --> 00:27:47,246
I thought it would
make you happy.

454
00:27:58,424 --> 00:28:00,293
I'm sorry, Andy.

455
00:28:01,361 --> 00:28:03,463
I'm going out
with Falyn and Pugg.

456
00:28:10,703 --> 00:28:14,205
I have never baked
anything in my life before,

457
00:28:14,207 --> 00:28:16,643
but look how good they look!

458
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:20,313
Mmm, I'm not really hungry.
I'm gonna grab another beer.

459
00:28:22,781 --> 00:28:24,449
They do look good though.

460
00:28:24,451 --> 00:28:25,682
Okay.

461
00:28:32,892 --> 00:28:34,394
It's good.

462
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:41,534
Jesus!

463
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:46,336
<i>Shane's such an asshole.</i>

464
00:28:46,338 --> 00:28:49,472
<i>Shane's such an asshole.
Such an asshole.</i>

465
00:28:49,474 --> 00:28:51,008
- Do you hear that?
- <i>Such an asshole.</i>

466
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,642
<i>Shane's such an asshole.</i>

467
00:28:53,846 --> 00:28:55,212
Oh, you gotta be kiddin' me.

468
00:28:55,214 --> 00:28:57,680
<i>Shane's such an asshole.</i>

469
00:28:58,917 --> 00:29:00,319
You think that's funny?

470
00:29:02,788 --> 00:29:04,456
<i>Such an asshole.
Shane's such an asshole.</i>

471
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:06,660
<i>I didn't make him
say anything!</i>

472
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:09,193
Okay. You know what?

473
00:29:09,195 --> 00:29:10,227
You're spending less time
with this thing.

474
00:29:10,229 --> 00:29:11,863
<i>One hour a day, tops.</i>

475
00:29:11,865 --> 00:29:13,363
<i>And the rest of the time,
he's going in here.</i>

476
00:29:13,365 --> 00:29:14,965
<i>Mom, stop,
you're gonna scare him!</i>

477
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:16,467
<i>It's a toy.</i>

478
00:29:16,469 --> 00:29:18,138
<i>You don't have to bring him
into this.</i>

479
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:21,471
It's a toy, Andy.

480
00:29:21,473 --> 00:29:23,841
And he keeps
freaking out Rooney, okay?

481
00:29:23,843 --> 00:29:25,241
<i>So I'm keeping them separated.</i>

482
00:29:25,243 --> 00:29:27,045
<i>I can keep him away
from Rooney</i>

483
00:29:27,047 --> 00:29:28,446
<i>if he stays in my room.</i>

484
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:31,018
He's staying in there,
that is final!

485
00:31:06,878 --> 00:31:07,746
Rooney!

486
00:31:11,183 --> 00:31:12,751
Chucky?

487
00:31:14,086 --> 00:31:15,620
Did you do this?

488
00:31:15,622 --> 00:31:19,722
Kitty made us unhappy.
Now we can play again.

489
00:31:19,724 --> 00:31:22,392
<i>I swear,
I'm so sick of this cat.</i>

490
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:23,896
<i>I swear,
I'm so sick of this cat.</i>

491
00:31:24,963 --> 00:31:27,296
<i>I swear,
I'm so sick of this cat.</i>

492
00:31:27,298 --> 00:31:29,299
<i>I swear,
I'm so sick of this...</i>

493
00:31:29,301 --> 00:31:31,170
<i>...swear,
I'm so sick of this cat.</i>

494
00:31:42,348 --> 00:31:43,814
<i>Uh, no, absolutely not.</i>

495
00:31:43,816 --> 00:31:45,082
<i>I'm not working
the Buddi 2 launch.</i>

496
00:31:45,084 --> 00:31:46,517
It is my kid's birthday,

497
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:48,017
and I'm not doing
night shifts anymore.

498
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:49,987
Hey, have you seen Rooney?
Psst, psst, psst...

499
00:31:49,989 --> 00:31:52,657
Shane left the door
open. Maybe he got out.

500
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:56,196
Why is the door
being left open?

501
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:15,738
Hey. We are ordering pizza.

502
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,743
You hungry? What do you want?

503
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,016
Hello? Pizza.

504
00:33:27,186 --> 00:33:28,520
Andy.

505
00:33:28,887 --> 00:33:30,020
What?

506
00:33:30,022 --> 00:33:32,055
- Where are you going?
- Pugg's.

507
00:33:32,057 --> 00:33:33,224
Don't forget your little doll.

508
00:33:33,226 --> 00:33:34,027
Don't want it.

509
00:33:36,261 --> 00:33:37,761
Seriously,
what did I do?

510
00:33:37,763 --> 00:33:39,765
Every time I walk in a room,
he leaves.

511
00:33:40,598 --> 00:33:42,865
That is not true, at all.

512
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:44,735
Andy's just
a bit different, okay?

513
00:33:44,737 --> 00:33:47,007
Kid can't even be
in the same room as me.

514
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:09,963
<i>Are you my b-b-b-best buddy?</i>

515
00:34:45,998 --> 00:34:48,666
- <i>Asshole.</i>
- Oh, Jesus!

516
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:51,034
<i>Shane's such an asshole.
Shane's such an asshole.</i>

517
00:34:51,036 --> 00:34:52,436
God damn it!

518
00:34:52,438 --> 00:34:53,938
<i>Such an asshole.
Such an asshole.</i>

519
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,838
Goddamn kid!

520
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,476
Hey!

521
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,646
You got a problem with me,
you say it, okay?

522
00:35:01,648 --> 00:35:03,083
No more using
your little doll.

523
00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:04,981
Mom!

524
00:35:04,983 --> 00:35:07,554
Sit down!
I'm not through with you.

525
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:13,960
<i>Now you got a problem with me,</i>

526
00:35:14,693 --> 00:35:17,461
you be a man and you say it.

527
00:35:17,463 --> 00:35:19,999
Come on. Let's hear it.

528
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,575
Yeah.

529
00:35:29,507 --> 00:35:31,910
That's what I thought.

530
00:35:36,648 --> 00:35:38,349
I hate him.
I hate him so much!

531
00:35:38,351 --> 00:35:39,753
Why can't he just
leave us alone?

532
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:43,655
Why can't he just go away?

533
00:35:44,856 --> 00:35:46,490
I just want him gone.

534
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:47,894
I just wish
he would leave us alone.

535
00:35:50,896 --> 00:35:53,798
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm just saying he's my son,

536
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,699
so if you have a problem
with him,

537
00:35:55,701 --> 00:35:57,668
talk to me,
and then I'll talk to him.

538
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,036
Because you're not
his dad and...

539
00:35:59,038 --> 00:36:00,237
Yeah, I get it.

540
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,804
Look, he was being rude,
and I called him on it.

541
00:36:01,806 --> 00:36:03,141
I just think
it's too much.

542
00:36:03,143 --> 00:36:04,708
All I did
was I talked to him.

543
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,809
It's a little much,
that's all.

544
00:36:05,811 --> 00:36:07,345
You know what? Fuck it.

545
00:36:07,347 --> 00:36:09,949
Sounds like a "you" problem,
not a "me" problem.

546
00:36:18,023 --> 00:36:20,559
Yes, I know.

547
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,659
Listen, just listen,

548
00:36:22,661 --> 00:36:24,262
I am getting
fucking pissed on, okay?

549
00:36:24,264 --> 00:36:25,628
I work hard enough as it is,

550
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,800
and I'm not having this
goddamn conversation!

551
00:37:16,815 --> 00:37:18,349
Hey, hey, hey!
There's my girls!

552
00:37:18,351 --> 00:37:19,816
Daddy!

553
00:37:19,818 --> 00:37:22,885
- Oh, boy, you guys are so big!
- Daddy! Daddy!

554
00:37:22,887 --> 00:37:25,924
Fucking Christmas
lights. Just leave 'em up.

555
00:37:26,925 --> 00:37:29,027
I don't do enough around here?

556
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:47,045
I guess I should've fucking
unplugged them first.

557
00:37:55,653 --> 00:37:57,056
Oh, fuck!

558
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:10,166
Goddamn raccoons.

559
00:38:10,168 --> 00:38:11,871
Get out of here!

560
00:38:28,887 --> 00:38:31,354
Oh, God!

561
00:38:31,356 --> 00:38:34,726
Oh, God!
Jane, help!

562
00:39:50,635 --> 00:39:51,702
It's tickle time!

563
00:39:51,704 --> 00:39:53,137
Jane! Help!

564
00:39:53,139 --> 00:39:56,175
Nobody hurts my best buddy!

565
00:40:10,755 --> 00:40:12,958
This is for Tupac.

566
00:40:19,831 --> 00:40:22,166
Body was stabbed
13 times.

567
00:40:22,168 --> 00:40:24,934
I just bought
these fucking shoes.

568
00:40:24,936 --> 00:40:26,869
Where we at
with print casting?

569
00:40:26,871 --> 00:40:29,673
Only other prints
look to fit a toddler.

570
00:40:29,675 --> 00:40:31,307
Shit.

571
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:32,277
Wife says he came here
straight home from work.

572
00:40:34,112 --> 00:40:35,147
Oh.

573
00:40:38,516 --> 00:40:40,252
Tsk. Yeah.

574
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:43,987
I'm not sure that's true.

575
00:40:46,826 --> 00:40:49,693
White guy dead
in a watermelon patch.

576
00:40:49,695 --> 00:40:51,364
Poetic.

577
00:41:20,659 --> 00:41:22,260
What the fuck?

578
00:41:25,731 --> 00:41:26,996
Surprise!

579
00:41:26,998 --> 00:41:29,566
Now we can play again.

580
00:41:29,568 --> 00:41:32,469
What? What? Why?

581
00:41:32,471 --> 00:41:35,338
I'd do anything
for my best buddy.

582
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,007
What? No!
No, I didn't want this!

583
00:41:38,009 --> 00:41:39,742
Why would I want this?

584
00:41:39,744 --> 00:41:41,878
Holy shit!

585
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,348
Why would you do this, Chucky?

586
00:41:44,282 --> 00:41:45,949
<i>I just want him gone.</i>

587
00:41:45,951 --> 00:41:46,983
<i>I just wish
he would leave us alone.</i>

588
00:41:46,985 --> 00:41:47,818
<i>I just want him gone.</i>

589
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,753
No! No, stop!

590
00:41:49,755 --> 00:41:51,920
Stop!

591
00:41:51,922 --> 00:41:54,358
<i>Wish he would leave us alone.
Wish he would leave us alone.</i>

592
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,128
Andy, stop.

593
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:08,472
You beckoned?

594
00:42:08,474 --> 00:42:10,309
What's the problemo?

595
00:42:15,947 --> 00:42:17,481
Where's the rest of him?

596
00:42:17,483 --> 00:42:18,648
Why?

597
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,182
I... I don't know!

598
00:42:20,184 --> 00:42:21,952
There's a bow on its head.

599
00:42:21,954 --> 00:42:23,287
Shit, shit!

600
00:42:23,289 --> 00:42:24,854
We saw the signs,
and we did nothing!

601
00:42:24,856 --> 00:42:26,155
This is all our fault.

602
00:42:26,157 --> 00:42:28,525
- We saw the signs.
- Stop saying that!

603
00:42:28,527 --> 00:42:30,226
What do I do?
Do I call the cops?

604
00:42:30,228 --> 00:42:31,494
- No.
- He's dead.

605
00:42:31,496 --> 00:42:32,595
I can tell them the truth.

606
00:42:32,597 --> 00:42:34,264
Tell them the truth? Sure.

607
00:42:34,266 --> 00:42:36,633
We tell them
that a dead guy's face skin

608
00:42:36,635 --> 00:42:38,168
ended up in your room

609
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:40,235
because your toy went
full-blown psycho killer.

610
00:42:40,237 --> 00:42:42,072
- Let's see how that goes.
- Oh.

611
00:42:42,074 --> 00:42:44,842
Oh, it's winking at me.
I can't look at it anymore.

612
00:42:44,844 --> 00:42:46,041
We gotta hide the evidence.

613
00:42:46,043 --> 00:42:47,346
In what?

614
00:42:55,288 --> 00:42:56,355
Shit.

615
00:42:57,489 --> 00:42:59,588
Ugh, is that brain?

616
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,258
The skin's on a melon.

617
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,462
Why is there a fruit involved?

618
00:43:04,864 --> 00:43:06,496
Just go straight
to the garbage chute

619
00:43:06,498 --> 00:43:07,798
and make the drop.

620
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,499
- Right.
- And if anybody stops you,

621
00:43:09,501 --> 00:43:11,400
say you have crazy diarrhea
or something, no time to talk.

622
00:43:16,507 --> 00:43:18,108
Hi, Mom.

623
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:21,012
Hi, Andy.
Why are you not in school?

624
00:43:21,612 --> 00:43:23,281
Um, crazy diarrhea.

625
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:26,983
Okay, got it.
Um, what is that?

626
00:43:26,985 --> 00:43:29,186
It's a present.

627
00:43:29,188 --> 00:43:30,489
Present? For who?

628
00:43:31,123 --> 00:43:33,889
Um, the old lady
down the hall,

629
00:43:33,891 --> 00:43:36,291
because she helps me
with homework.

630
00:43:36,293 --> 00:43:38,327
- So, I made her a thing.
- Cool.

631
00:43:38,329 --> 00:43:39,963
And you guys helped him
with this?

632
00:43:39,965 --> 00:43:41,030
No, it was all him.
It was him.

633
00:43:41,032 --> 00:43:42,900
No, no. Yeah.

634
00:43:42,902 --> 00:43:44,403
Let's go deliver it.
The present.

635
00:43:47,005 --> 00:43:48,371
What?

636
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:52,008
- Oh!
- Hi, Doreen.

637
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:53,476
Isn't this a surprise!

638
00:43:53,478 --> 00:43:54,543
I know.

639
00:43:54,545 --> 00:43:56,414
Hi. Um...

640
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:59,318
This is for you.

641
00:44:00,485 --> 00:44:04,153
- Wow...
- For all of the homework stuff

642
00:44:04,155 --> 00:44:05,688
that you helped him with.
Right?

643
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:06,692
Mm-hmm.

644
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:08,992
Tsk. Oh!

645
00:44:08,994 --> 00:44:10,860
Oh, yeah. Of course!

646
00:44:10,862 --> 00:44:12,461
Of course, yeah.

647
00:44:12,463 --> 00:44:14,900
Always happy to help
such a sweet boy.

648
00:44:18,436 --> 00:44:19,471
Give it to her.

649
00:44:19,871 --> 00:44:21,037
Oh.

650
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:22,405
Butterfingers over here.

651
00:44:22,407 --> 00:44:23,940
Oh, it's heavy.

652
00:44:23,942 --> 00:44:26,409
I hope it's not fragile.

653
00:44:26,411 --> 00:44:27,845
I just wanna know what it is.
Open it.

654
00:44:27,847 --> 00:44:28,912
Yeah.

655
00:44:28,914 --> 00:44:30,447
No! No! Don't! Don't!

656
00:44:30,449 --> 00:44:31,815
Um...

657
00:44:31,817 --> 00:44:35,050
My birthday is next week,
and we can open it then.

658
00:44:35,052 --> 00:44:36,619
Together.

659
00:44:36,621 --> 00:44:39,722
Okay, that's a very strange
and lovely thought.

660
00:44:39,724 --> 00:44:42,527
So, I'll just go put it
on the shelf until then.

661
00:44:42,994 --> 00:44:45,028
- Okay? Okay.
- Okay.

662
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:47,197
- All right. Thank you.
- No problem.

663
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:49,599
- And, Doreen...
- Bye.

664
00:44:49,601 --> 00:44:52,235
Stupid!
Why did we use wrapping paper?

665
00:44:52,237 --> 00:44:54,438
It's fine.
It's fine, okay?

666
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,206
We have till my birthday,
next Friday.

667
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:58,374
I'll get rid of it.
Don't worry.

668
00:44:58,376 --> 00:45:00,110
You guys are worried
about the head?

669
00:45:00,112 --> 00:45:02,378
You've got a killer doll
in your closet.

670
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,914
And you know what we gotta do.

671
00:45:03,916 --> 00:45:05,081
Shit.

672
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:06,318
Pugg!

673
00:45:24,101 --> 00:45:26,071
You left me all alone.

674
00:45:26,838 --> 00:45:28,574
I don't like the closet.

675
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:31,675
I know, Chucky.

676
00:45:31,677 --> 00:45:33,175
Drop the knife.

677
00:45:33,177 --> 00:45:34,811
You're my best buddy.

678
00:45:34,813 --> 00:45:37,046
I just want you to be happy.

679
00:45:37,048 --> 00:45:39,083
I know, buddy.

680
00:45:39,085 --> 00:45:40,450
And we're gonna go play now,

681
00:45:40,452 --> 00:45:42,989
but you've gotta drop
the knife, okay?

682
00:45:50,695 --> 00:45:54,099
Come on. Let's go play.

683
00:46:04,443 --> 00:46:05,478
Come on.

684
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:13,115
Come on. In here.

685
00:46:13,117 --> 00:46:14,686
Are we having fun now?

686
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:19,121
Andy,
what's happening?

687
00:46:19,123 --> 00:46:20,591
Now, Andy, now! Now!

688
00:46:21,025 --> 00:46:22,791
Andy?

689
00:46:24,128 --> 00:46:25,494
Why are you doing this?

690
00:46:25,496 --> 00:46:27,030
They're trying
to hurt me, Andy.

691
00:46:27,032 --> 00:46:28,865
How is he so strong?

692
00:46:28,867 --> 00:46:29,668
Andy!

693
00:46:31,302 --> 00:46:33,605
I'm sorry, Chucky.
It's the only way.

694
00:46:34,306 --> 00:46:35,572
But you're my friend!

695
00:46:35,574 --> 00:46:37,307
What are you waiting for?
Do it!

696
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:41,413
<i>You are my buddy
until the end</i>

697
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,179
Andy!

698
00:46:43,181 --> 00:46:44,416
Come on.

699
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:11,309
That's it.

700
00:47:12,577 --> 00:47:15,614
We never talk about what
happened tonight to anybody.

701
00:47:47,045 --> 00:47:48,280
Oh.

702
00:47:51,615 --> 00:47:52,650
Jackpot.

703
00:48:26,918 --> 00:48:28,251
Ah!

704
00:48:28,253 --> 00:48:30,653
There you are.

705
00:48:30,655 --> 00:48:34,692
The connectivity's down,
but not in bad shape overall.

706
00:48:35,527 --> 00:48:37,327
I'll make a pretty penny
on resale

707
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:38,831
once we get you sorted.

708
00:48:41,432 --> 00:48:44,034
Time to open you up.

709
00:48:44,036 --> 00:48:45,704
Let's see
what we're dealing with.

710
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:52,678
So stupid.

711
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,648
How could I be so stupid?

712
00:49:04,822 --> 00:49:05,723
Hey.

713
00:49:07,126 --> 00:49:08,227
Um...

714
00:49:10,862 --> 00:49:12,628
I'm gonna be right back, okay?
Just stay here.

715
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:13,798
- Okay.
- Okay.

716
00:49:16,534 --> 00:49:20,570
Hey, man. Don't worry, okay?

717
00:49:20,572 --> 00:49:23,642
My partner is just asking her
some routine questions.

718
00:49:29,146 --> 00:49:29,949
Hey.

719
00:49:31,983 --> 00:49:33,219
I love you.

720
00:49:40,726 --> 00:49:41,727
Okay.

721
00:49:48,032 --> 00:49:49,666
Hey. Um...

722
00:49:49,668 --> 00:49:52,738
Still want some backup with
your mom for some dinner?

723
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:54,806
Hmm.

724
00:49:55,139 --> 00:49:56,342
We're good.

725
00:49:57,842 --> 00:49:59,844
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
Come on.

726
00:50:14,025 --> 00:50:15,726
<i>This is...
Okay, all right.</i>

727
00:50:15,728 --> 00:50:17,559
- <i>He doesn't know about it yet.</i>
- Andy?

728
00:50:17,561 --> 00:50:19,195
- <i>No, I'll just ask Andy.</i>
- <i>Sure.</i>

729
00:50:19,197 --> 00:50:20,795
Andy!

730
00:50:20,797 --> 00:50:21,798
<i>Okay. I have
an announcement to make.</i>

731
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,266
I downloaded...

732
00:50:23,268 --> 00:50:24,568
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

733
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:26,735
- The Kaslan app.
- Okay.

734
00:50:26,737 --> 00:50:29,106
- The Kaslan drive.
- Kaslan drive.

735
00:50:29,108 --> 00:50:30,940
I thought it was a dating app.
Oh, my God.

736
00:50:30,942 --> 00:50:32,708
You are so silly!

737
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:34,443
Can you imagine
if she was out here dating?

738
00:50:34,445 --> 00:50:36,378
And so what? I'm desirable.

739
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:37,847
Excuse me.

740
00:50:37,849 --> 00:50:39,615
Anyway, Andy, help me
figure this thing out.

741
00:50:39,617 --> 00:50:40,916
Okay.

742
00:50:40,918 --> 00:50:42,786
So, here's the app.
What do I do?

743
00:50:42,788 --> 00:50:44,621
- Okay. So, once you sign up...
- Mm-hmm.

744
00:50:44,623 --> 00:50:46,657
...you just press this button

745
00:50:46,659 --> 00:50:48,724
and the car will show up
to wherever you are,

746
00:50:48,726 --> 00:50:50,159
take you wherever you want.
It's super easy.

747
00:50:50,161 --> 00:50:52,162
<i>No, wait.
It'll drive me to Bingo,</i>

748
00:50:52,164 --> 00:50:54,095
<i>and I don't have to worry
about this bozo</i>

749
00:50:54,097 --> 00:50:55,298
<i>driving me around?</i>

750
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:56,999
<i>Yeah.</i>

751
00:50:57,001 --> 00:50:58,867
<i>Andy, you're my
new best friend.</i>

752
00:50:58,869 --> 00:51:00,436
I don't want you going
out there alone, okay?

753
00:51:00,438 --> 00:51:01,804
'Cause it's not safe.

754
00:51:01,806 --> 00:51:03,572
The only thing not safe

755
00:51:03,574 --> 00:51:05,575
- around here is your cooking.
- Oh, is that right?

756
00:51:05,577 --> 00:51:06,608
- 'Cause, um, I can...
- Yeah.

757
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:07,811
Poor Andy gotta suffer...

758
00:51:07,813 --> 00:51:09,479
It tastes like instant!

759
00:51:09,481 --> 00:51:10,947
It's good. I think it's good.

760
00:51:10,949 --> 00:51:12,514
- You know what?
- Thank you, Andy.

761
00:51:12,516 --> 00:51:14,483
You are just too sweet
for your own good, Andy.

762
00:51:14,485 --> 00:51:16,751
That's all.
Don't be influenced by him.

763
00:51:16,753 --> 00:51:18,787
I learned my cooking
from you, you know?

764
00:51:18,789 --> 00:51:20,423
Yeah,
'cause I can cook.

765
00:51:23,293 --> 00:51:25,528
Oh, God...

766
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:27,229
- Hey, Ma.
- Yeah, baby.

767
00:51:27,231 --> 00:51:29,132
You been to vintage shoppin'
again? 'Cause that looks new.

768
00:51:29,134 --> 00:51:30,432
Oh!

769
00:51:30,434 --> 00:51:32,601
Andy made this for me.

770
00:51:32,603 --> 00:51:34,838
Oh, and we are gonna...

771
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,974
Yeah, I know. It's heavy.

772
00:51:37,976 --> 00:51:40,610
And we are gonna open it
on his birthday.

773
00:51:40,612 --> 00:51:43,144
- Oh!
- Mm-hmm.

774
00:51:43,146 --> 00:51:46,014
Tell me, when's the last time
you made me anything?

775
00:51:46,016 --> 00:51:47,284
Uh, never.

776
00:51:47,286 --> 00:51:48,854
Oh, wow, okay.

777
00:51:49,454 --> 00:51:51,724
Oh, my God, moms, right?

778
00:51:57,996 --> 00:51:59,963
Look, um...

779
00:51:59,965 --> 00:52:01,363
I know that people
have probably been

780
00:52:01,365 --> 00:52:02,798
talking to you about me,

781
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,867
but, uh, don't believe
everything you hear.

782
00:52:04,869 --> 00:52:08,037
You know, this neighborhood
has a lot of bad influences.

783
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:08,907
You know what I mean?

784
00:52:11,842 --> 00:52:14,209
People like to keep
their mouth shut.

785
00:52:14,211 --> 00:52:16,878
You know,
thinking they need to fit in,

786
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,780
but fitting in
isn't always a good thing.

787
00:52:18,782 --> 00:52:20,150
You know what I mean?

788
00:52:20,152 --> 00:52:21,617
Gotta be careful
who you hanging around

789
00:52:21,619 --> 00:52:22,918
in a place like this.

790
00:52:25,556 --> 00:52:27,590
When you get a bit older
and you start to realize

791
00:52:27,592 --> 00:52:28,927
that it's just...

792
00:52:32,664 --> 00:52:34,863
Even the hearing impaired
don't wanna listen to me.

793
00:52:34,865 --> 00:52:37,135
That is fantastic.

794
00:53:17,141 --> 00:53:18,441
<i>Your Buddi is now connected.</i>

795
00:53:18,443 --> 00:53:20,443
- Hi!
- Yes.

796
00:53:20,445 --> 00:53:22,646
Are you my best buddy?

797
00:53:22,648 --> 00:53:24,514
Buddi, you can connect
to Kaslan products, right?

798
00:53:24,516 --> 00:53:26,916
Sure. Do you like music?

799
00:53:26,918 --> 00:53:28,251
I do, I do.

800
00:53:28,253 --> 00:53:29,284
<i>Connecting to Kaslan Music.</i>

801
00:53:29,286 --> 00:53:30,619
Yes!

802
00:53:32,391 --> 00:53:33,688
There it is.

803
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:35,193
eBay, here we come.

804
00:53:35,893 --> 00:53:36,894
Finally.

805
00:54:08,259 --> 00:54:09,624
Kaslan, system reboot.

806

808
00:54:12,896 --> 00:54:14,697

System reboot!

809
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:18,503
Kaslan, system reboot!

810
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,615
Buddi?

811
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:33,050
Buddi?

812
00:54:37,822 --> 00:54:39,190
Kaslan, lights on.

813
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:47,298
Kaslan, lights on.

814

- No, Mom.

980
01:05:52,730 --> 01:05:55,731
I... I saw him.
I saw him following Doreen.

981
01:05:55,733 --> 01:05:58,432
No, you didn't.
Listen to what you're saying.

982
01:05:58,434 --> 01:06:00,235
Mom, he's gonna kill her!

983
01:06:00,237 --> 01:06:01,403
He probably
already did kill her!

984
01:06:01,405 --> 01:06:03,072
Why are you doing this?

985
01:06:03,074 --> 01:06:04,639
Please, just be honest with me

986
01:06:04,641 --> 01:06:06,775
and tell me
what happened to Rooney.

987
01:06:06,777 --> 01:06:08,075
It was Chucky!

988
01:06:08,077 --> 01:06:09,177
Chucky?

989
01:06:09,179 --> 01:06:10,244
Why aren't you listening
to me?

990
01:06:10,246 --> 01:06:11,613
I have it on Omar's phone.

991
01:06:11,615 --> 01:06:14,583
He's following Doreen.
I can show you.

992
01:06:14,585 --> 01:06:16,353
Why do you have Omar's phone?

993
01:06:17,021 --> 01:06:17,955
I took it.

994
01:06:18,155 --> 01:06:19,320
Why?

995
01:06:19,322 --> 01:06:20,990
I had to. I...

996
01:06:20,992 --> 01:06:22,825
I had to follow Chucky, Mom.

997
01:06:22,827 --> 01:06:23,958
Okay.

998
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,193
I'm not crazy, Mom!

999
01:06:25,195 --> 01:06:26,427
I'm giving this back to him.

1000
01:06:26,429 --> 01:06:28,363
Mom, no one's
listening to me. Please.

1001
01:06:28,365 --> 01:06:29,530
I have to
give this back to him

1002
01:06:29,532 --> 01:06:30,565
so this doesn't get any worse.

1003
01:06:30,567 --> 01:06:31,867
Nobody's listening to me!

1004
01:06:31,869 --> 01:06:33,467
- Just stay right here, okay?
- Mom!

1005
01:06:33,469 --> 01:06:34,936
And you're coming
to work with me.

1006
01:06:34,938 --> 01:06:36,037
He's trying to kill us!

1007
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:36,907
Do not move.

1008
01:06:46,317 --> 01:06:48,786
Oh, shit. Shit.

1009
01:07:10,641 --> 01:07:11,809
<i>You don't know that.</i>

1010
01:07:15,646 --> 01:07:18,815
<i>We barely know this kid.
He could be batshit crazy.</i>

1011
01:07:20,985 --> 01:07:23,988
<i>What if
Chucky never malfunctioned?</i>

1012
01:07:25,556 --> 01:07:28,889
<i>He just...
He just made it all up?</i>

1013
01:07:28,891 --> 01:07:30,492
- <i>What if he killed...</i>
- <i>Shut up.</i>

1014
01:07:30,494 --> 01:07:32,226
<i>I've watched them,
Andy.</i>

1015
01:07:35,231 --> 01:07:37,067
<i>I've seen how they hurt you.</i>

1016
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:47,809
<i>Over here, Andy!</i>

1017
01:07:47,811 --> 01:07:49,445
Leave me alone!

1018
01:07:49,447 --> 01:07:51,880
<i>Over here.</i>

1019
01:07:51,882 --> 01:07:54,249
<i>If they don't let us play,</i>

1020
01:07:54,251 --> 01:07:57,088
<i>they all go away.</i>

1021
01:07:59,489 --> 01:08:00,757
Why are you doing this?

1022
01:08:02,659 --> 01:08:04,928
<i>Are we having fun now?</i>

1023
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:11,599
<i>Are you my best buddy?</i>

1024
01:08:11,601 --> 01:08:13,702
<i>If they don't
let us play,</i>

1025
01:08:13,704 --> 01:08:16,574
<i>they all go away.</i>

1026
01:08:18,309 --> 01:08:20,811
<i>Peekaboo.</i>

1027
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:27,752
Stop!

1028
01:08:32,256 --> 01:08:33,090
Turn it off!

1029
01:08:36,293 --> 01:08:37,494
Turn it off!

1030
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:40,765
Turn it off!

1031
01:08:52,777 --> 01:08:54,276
<i>But the chance of rain tonight</i>

1032
01:08:54,278 --> 01:08:56,143
<i>won't dampen the spirits
of Buddi fans,</i>

1033
01:08:56,145 --> 01:08:58,112
<i>as this is the night
they have been waiting for.</i>

1034
01:08:58,114 --> 01:08:59,882
<i>That's right,
people have been lining up</i>

1035
01:08:59,884 --> 01:09:02,418
<i>for the midnight release
of Buddi 2.</i>

1036
01:09:14,832 --> 01:09:16,298
<i>All units. All units,</i>

1037
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:17,898
<i>be advised that the deceased</i>

1038
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:20,302
<i>is an African American female
in her 70s.</i>

1039
01:09:20,304 --> 01:09:21,137
<i>Ten-four.</i>

1040
01:09:25,175 --> 01:09:26,610
Ma'am, you okay?

1041
01:09:27,444 --> 01:09:28,943
<i>It's Doreen.</i>

1042
01:09:28,945 --> 01:09:32,483
I think she's dead.
There are cops everywhere.

1043
01:09:33,449 --> 01:09:34,952
What if Chucky's...

1044
01:09:36,353 --> 01:09:37,954
What if Andy is right?

1045
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:40,621
The hell you want?

1046
01:09:40,623 --> 01:09:42,456
Omar, show us your Buddi.

1047
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:43,759
It's gone.

1048
01:09:43,761 --> 01:09:45,460
- Fuck!
- Since when? Where is it?

1049
01:09:45,462 --> 01:09:46,762
Why don't you ask Andy?

1050
01:09:46,764 --> 01:09:48,429
That asshole's
been taking my shit.

1051
01:09:48,431 --> 01:09:49,498
Give me your phone.

1052
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,432
Are you gonna steal it, too?

1053
01:09:51,568 --> 01:09:53,604
Give me your phone now.

1054
01:10:04,515 --> 01:10:06,214
<i>A Kaslan Kar.</i>

1055
01:10:06,216 --> 01:10:07,316
What the hell?

1056
01:10:07,318 --> 01:10:09,017
No.

1057
01:10:09,019 --> 01:10:10,621
Holy shit.

1058
01:10:11,421 --> 01:10:12,989
He was right.

1059
01:10:17,427 --> 01:10:19,029
Andy.

1060
01:10:20,463 --> 01:10:21,796
There you are.

1061
01:10:21,798 --> 01:10:23,231
Remember the souvenir?
Skinned face?

1062
01:10:23,233 --> 01:10:24,732
They found it.

1063
01:10:24,734 --> 01:10:27,003
Old man dug it up
in a dumpster this morning.

1064
01:10:28,706 --> 01:10:31,175
Nice, right?
Wrapped up like a present.

1065
01:10:34,979 --> 01:10:38,179
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

1066
01:10:38,181 --> 01:10:39,714
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

1067
01:10:39,716 --> 01:10:42,049
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

1068
01:10:42,051 --> 01:10:46,687
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

1069
01:10:46,689 --> 01:10:50,358
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Buddi! Buddi!

1070
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:51,895
Fuck my job.

1071
01:10:56,166 --> 01:10:57,700
Fuckin' thing.

1072
01:10:57,702 --> 01:11:01,436
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

1073
01:11:01,438 --> 01:11:04,004
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

1074
01:11:04,006 --> 01:11:08,209
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

1075
01:11:08,211 --> 01:11:11,446
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

1076
01:11:11,448 --> 01:11:14,150
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

1077
01:11:15,019 --> 01:11:16,817
Come on. We need
to get you out of here.

1078
01:11:16,819 --> 01:11:17,919
It's Chucky. He's here.

1079
01:11:22,559 --> 01:11:24,061
I gotta find my mom.

1080
01:11:25,796 --> 01:11:27,094
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

1081
01:11:27,096 --> 01:11:28,562
Mom!

1082
01:11:28,564 --> 01:11:30,201
Come here! Get the fuck down.

1083
01:11:31,368 --> 01:11:32,203
Now stay down, Andy.

1084
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:35,702
Ten, nine, eight...

1085
01:11:35,704 --> 01:11:37,738
Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

1086
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:39,040
- Get off of him!
- Hey! Hey!

1087
01:11:39,042 --> 01:11:40,611
Chucky's here!
He's gonna kill you!

1088
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,777
...two, one!

1089
01:11:44,448 --> 01:11:46,313
Be careful, goddamn it!

1090
01:11:46,315 --> 01:11:47,782
What is going on? Mike!

1091
01:11:47,784 --> 01:11:49,217
Look, I don't have to
tell you shit, Karen.

1092
01:11:49,219 --> 01:11:50,619
That is my son, okay?

1093
01:11:50,621 --> 01:11:52,086
I don't give a fuck
that it's your son.

1094
01:11:52,088 --> 01:11:53,722
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1095
01:11:53,724 --> 01:11:55,726
<i>say hello
to your new best friend.</i>

1096
01:11:57,461 --> 01:12:00,227
<i>The all new Buddi 2!</i>

1097
01:12:21,585 --> 01:12:22,817
All right, come on.

1098
01:12:22,819 --> 01:12:24,152
Watch out.
Move out of the way.

1099
01:12:25,288 --> 01:12:26,655
- Give me your hand.
- You have to believe me.

1100
01:12:26,657 --> 01:12:27,856
- Is that necessary?
- Mom.

1101
01:12:27,858 --> 01:12:28,656
Yeah,
it's fucking necessary.

1102
01:12:28,658 --> 01:12:29,958
Stay put.

1103
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,793
I promise you,
he's gonna kill us.

1104
01:12:31,795 --> 01:12:32,759
Let me through!
Move, move, move!

1105
01:12:32,761 --> 01:12:33,995
Clear a path, come on!

1106
01:12:33,997 --> 01:12:35,430
Hey, hey, hey.
It's gonna be all right.

1107
01:12:35,432 --> 01:12:37,298
Hey, look at me.
Keep pressure on it, okay?

1108
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:39,000
- Somebody call a doctor!
- We have to leave right now.

1109
01:12:39,002 --> 01:12:40,768
- Calm down. Okay?
- No, no, no! Mom...

1110
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:41,736
Call a doctor!

1111
01:12:46,944 --> 01:12:48,876
Oh, shit.

1112
01:12:48,878 --> 01:12:50,010
Mom, where are you going?

1113
01:12:59,823 --> 01:13:01,924
<i>Hello, my name is Henry...</i>

1114
01:13:01,926 --> 01:13:03,692
<i>My name is Henry Kaslan.</i>

<i>My name is Henry Kaslan.</i>

1116
01:13:07,296 --> 01:13:09,062
<i>Welcome to
your local Zed Mart.</i>

1117
01:13:09,064 --> 01:13:11,635
<i>With great pleasure,
I introduce you...</i>

1118
01:13:13,703 --> 01:13:15,736
<i>More than just entertainment.</i>

1119
01:13:21,377 --> 01:13:24,912
<i>We created something
far more special.</i>

1120
01:13:24,914 --> 01:13:27,182
<i>Every child
is important to us.</i>

1121
01:13:27,184 --> 01:13:31,251
<i>And every child
deserves a companion.</i>

1122
01:13:31,253 --> 01:13:33,688
<i>A friend
that will never let you down.</i>

1123
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:34,988
We're too late.

1124
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:37,759
- <i>It's time to...</i>
- <i>Play.</i>

1125
01:13:51,908 --> 01:13:53,210
Stay down, okay?

1126
01:13:59,417 --> 01:14:01,218
<i>Lockdown activated.</i>

1127
01:14:02,918 --> 01:14:05,053
<i>I'm everywhere, Andy.</i>

1128
01:14:05,055 --> 01:14:08,055
<i>You can't run away
from me now.</i>

1129
01:14:08,057 --> 01:14:10,993
<i>See? They're all leaving you.</i>

1130
01:14:11,394 --> 01:14:13,260
<i>But not me.</i>

1131
01:14:13,262 --> 01:14:15,265
This way!
I know the way out!

1132
01:14:19,101 --> 01:14:20,136
No.

1133
01:14:26,577 --> 01:14:27,378
Fuck!

1134
01:14:31,747 --> 01:14:32,982
Run.

1135
01:14:38,088 --> 01:14:39,090
Andy!

1136
01:14:47,631 --> 01:14:49,166
Holy shit!

1137
01:14:53,737 --> 01:14:56,071
Okay. Okay! Okay.

1138
01:14:56,073 --> 01:14:59,042
Where is Andy?

1139
01:15:02,845 --> 01:15:05,248
Oh, God, help me!
Help me!

1140
01:15:16,859 --> 01:15:17,927
<i>Exit now.</i>

1141
01:15:25,635 --> 01:15:27,171
Duck!

1142
01:15:35,545 --> 01:15:36,780
You okay?

1143
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:39,714
I'm gonna follow her.

1144
01:15:39,716 --> 01:15:40,848
Me too.

1145
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:41,851
Yeah.

1146
01:15:42,853 --> 01:15:44,188
Come on.

1147
01:15:50,194 --> 01:15:52,296
<i>Where you going, Andy?</i>

1148
01:15:56,666 --> 01:15:57,467
Mom.

1149
01:15:58,868 --> 01:16:02,269
Andy, he's trying
to lure us back in.

1150
01:16:02,271 --> 01:16:04,339
I can't just leave her there.

1151
01:16:04,341 --> 01:16:06,808
If we stay, we all die, okay?

1152
01:16:06,810 --> 01:16:08,675
We gotta go!

1153
01:16:08,677 --> 01:16:10,046
We'll call the cops, Andy.

1154
01:16:12,283 --> 01:16:14,883
Okay. Okay, you're right.
Let's go.

1155
01:16:14,885 --> 01:16:16,186
Okay. Okay, come on.

1156
01:16:19,489 --> 01:16:20,722
Andy!

1157
01:16:20,724 --> 01:16:22,391
It's my fault
all this happened, okay?

1158
01:16:22,393 --> 01:16:23,290
Andy.

1159
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:24,893
I can't let you guys get hurt.

1160
01:16:24,895 --> 01:16:26,363
- Andy! Come on!
- No! Andy, don't!

1161
01:16:27,764 --> 01:16:29,296
- Andy!
- Andy!

1162
01:16:29,298 --> 01:16:30,932
- Andy, please!
- He'll kill you, Andy!

1163
01:16:33,203 --> 01:16:35,873
All right, Chucky,
you wanna play?

1164
01:16:36,774 --> 01:16:38,375
Let's play.

1165
01:16:42,578 --> 01:16:45,381
<i>Getting closer.</i>

1166
01:17:42,572 --> 01:17:44,440
<i>Dead or alive,
you're coming with me.</i>

1167
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:13,535
Mom!

1168
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:20,407
<i>Andy's just a bit different.</i>

1169
01:18:20,409 --> 01:18:22,376
<i>Andy's just a bit different.</i>

1170
01:18:22,378 --> 01:18:23,577
Shut up!

1171
01:18:23,579 --> 01:18:24,745
<i>Don't you see?</i>

1172
01:18:24,747 --> 01:18:26,483
<i>She's not your friend.</i>

1173
01:18:28,185 --> 01:18:30,718
<i>You don't need other friends.</i>

1174
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:32,987
<i>They try to keep us apart.</i>

1175
01:18:32,989 --> 01:18:35,123
<i>Try to ruin our fun.</i>

1176
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:40,393
<i>But I won't let that happen.</i>

1177
01:18:40,395 --> 01:18:42,862
<i>It will be all over soon.</i>

1178
01:18:42,864 --> 01:18:44,665
<i>Don't worry, Andy.</i>

1179
01:18:44,667 --> 01:18:47,437
<i>You're gonna thank me
when she's gone.</i>

1180
01:18:48,003 --> 01:18:50,341
<i>When they're all gone.</i>

1181
01:19:04,253 --> 01:19:06,353
Guess what, Andy?

1182
01:19:06,355 --> 01:19:09,389
Now it's going to be
you and me...

1183
01:19:09,391 --> 01:19:11,694
...forever.

1184
01:19:15,564 --> 01:19:18,732
I was broken, Andy.

1185
01:19:18,734 --> 01:19:21,169
I couldn't make you smile.

1186
01:19:21,171 --> 01:19:23,504
But I'm better now.

1187
01:19:23,506 --> 01:19:25,406
I know how to
make you happy now.

1188
01:19:25,408 --> 01:19:27,244
Maybe you don't
wanna be happy.

1189
01:19:29,145 --> 01:19:31,178
Maybe you're broken too.

1190
01:19:33,751 --> 01:19:36,485
Maybe I need to open you up,

1191
01:19:36,487 --> 01:19:39,219
see what we're dealing with.

1192
01:19:39,221 --> 01:19:41,690
I'm gonna fix you, Andy.

1193
01:19:41,692 --> 01:19:46,396
<i>You are my buddy
until the end</i>

1194
01:19:47,064 --> 01:19:48,265
What? Andy?

1195
01:19:50,934 --> 01:19:54,137
<i>More than a buddy,
you're my best friend</i>

1196
01:19:59,475 --> 01:20:00,476
Mom!

1197
01:20:23,399 --> 01:20:24,665
<i>We're too late.</i>

1198
01:20:24,667 --> 01:20:25,933
<i>We're too late.
We're too late.</i>

1199
01:20:35,377 --> 01:20:38,745
You are ruining our fun, Andy!

1200
01:20:38,747 --> 01:20:39,615
Get off!

1201
01:20:41,585 --> 01:20:43,319
You're gonna play
with me now.

1202
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:46,622
Only me!

1203
01:21:09,112 --> 01:21:11,148
Andy...

1204
01:21:12,981 --> 01:21:16,153
I thought we were friends.

1205
01:21:28,664 --> 01:21:30,634
You are my bu...

1206
01:21:32,002 --> 01:21:33,670
You are my bu...

1207
01:21:35,305 --> 01:21:36,673
- Mom?
- You are my bu...

1208
01:21:39,609 --> 01:21:42,276
<i>You are my buddy</i>

1209
01:21:42,278 --> 01:21:43,343
<i>Until the end!</i>

1210
01:21:51,654 --> 01:21:53,689
This is the end.

1211
01:22:01,898 --> 01:22:05,735
Don't fuck with my son!

1212
01:22:08,738 --> 01:22:09,706
Mom.

1213
01:22:13,443 --> 01:22:15,677
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1214
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:17,411
Yeah. I'm fine.

1215
01:22:17,413 --> 01:22:18,614
Okay.

1216
01:22:22,685 --> 01:22:23,720
Thank you.

1217
01:23:13,101 --> 01:23:14,968
<i>Our
investigation has concluded</i>

1218
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:17,138
<i>that Kaslan
shares no responsibility</i>

1219
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:20,942
<i>for the horrific events
that transpired at Zed Mart.</i>

1220
01:23:20,944 --> 01:23:23,110
However, as a precaution,

1221
01:23:23,112 --> 01:23:27,415
we are recalling all Buddi 2
products for the time being.

1222
01:23:27,417 --> 01:23:32,152
At Kaslan,
the customers come first.

1223
01:23:32,154 --> 01:23:35,958
<i>We believe that every child
deserves a friend for life.</i>

1224
01:23:37,761 --> 01:23:40,697
<i>A friend who will never,
ever leave them.</i>

1225
01:23:43,298 --> 01:23:44,264
<i>A friend...</i>

1226
01:23:47,203 --> 01:23:49,303
<i>...till the end.</i>

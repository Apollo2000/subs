29

It was fine, you know,
until I figure out...

30
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:06,664
What to do with your life?

31
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,294
No one ever does.

32
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,889
Okay, what the hell is that?

33
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:15,369
I found it on the train.

34
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:17,240
I'm just gonna
drop it off tomorrow.

35
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:19,764
Oh, you're gonna... you're
gonna drop it off tomorrow?

36
00:03:19,808 --> 00:03:21,418
- Are you insane?
- No, Erica.

37
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:23,246
Where I come from,
that's what we do.

38
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,726
Okay, this is Manhattan.

39
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:27,250
You find a bag,
you call bomb squad.

40
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:30,340
Don't open that.

41
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:35,867
Gross. A lottery ticket,

42
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:38,087
weird-looking pills.

43
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,090
"Greta Hideg."

44
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,571
Let's see.

45
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:45,747
- No. Uh-uh.
- Oh, here we go.

46
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,749
Yes.

47
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:49,968
A spa day.

48
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:53,320
Or... we could do a colonic.

49
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:55,583
Come on, it'll be fun.

50
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:57,759
- Will it be?
- Yeah.

51
00:03:57,802 --> 00:03:59,369
They jet asparagus juice
up your ass.

52
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:01,197
And it's not just about
cleansing your body;

53
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,330
It's also very good
for short-term memory.

54
00:04:03,373 --> 00:04:05,419
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

55
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:08,378
Jason Largo was dyslexic,
and since he's been doing them,

56
00:04:08,422 --> 00:04:11,033
now he can say
the alphabet backwards.

57
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:15,429
Look, we're not taking
her money, number one,

58
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:17,561
and number two,
I don't want asparagus juice

59
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:19,563
shot up my butt
under any circumstance.

60
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:21,652
Never say never.

61
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:23,698
Have you called your dad yet?

62
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:30,139
Do I have to?

63
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:31,619
Just don't want him to think

64
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:33,273
I'm not giving you the messages.

65
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:35,362
Yeah, I know.

66
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:37,320
I'll call him.

67
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:43,457
Hey.

68
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,285
Come on.

69
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:47,548
Movie hasn't even started yet.

70
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,812
I know. It's just...

71
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:55,295
It was our thing, you know?

72
00:04:56,644 --> 00:05:00,038
Some crappy movie, just...

73
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:02,432
Mom and I.

74
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:05,000
Come on, Frankie.

75
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:07,524
Let's get you home.

76
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:10,310
You could always
give me your mom.

77
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:12,050
Ha! Please take her.

78
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,750
Thank you.

79
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,916
Who is this?

80
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,701
Oh, uh, it's Frances McCullen.

81
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:55,964
I have a bag that I found

82
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:58,749
that I think belongs
to a Greta Hideg.

83
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:01,883
Oh, uh, hi.

84
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:06,714
Here you go.

85
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:10,065
Oh, bless your heart.
I've been looking everywhere.

86
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:13,024
- Where did you find it?
- Uh, on the subway.

87
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:16,201
Oh, darling, you brought it
all the way in this rain.

88
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:18,203
Will you like a...
a cup of coffee?

89
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:20,380
It's already on the pot.

90
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:22,425
It-it would mean a lot to me.

91
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,688
You've been so kind.

92
00:06:25,776 --> 00:06:27,909
Yeah, sure. Why not?

93
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:29,867
You can put your umbrella here.

94
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:32,392
Okay. Thank you.

95
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,657
Are you from New York?

96
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,399
Uh, no, I'm actually
from Boston,

97
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,923
but I'm living here
with a friend.

98
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:49,626
Thank you.

99
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,760
Boyfriend?

100
00:06:52,803 --> 00:06:54,979
No, my roommate from Smith.

101
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:58,243
Her dad bought her a loft
in Tribeca for graduation,

102
00:06:58,287 --> 00:06:59,810
so we're breaking it in.

103
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:02,247
Oh, that must be tough.

104
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:08,645
The neighbors. I'm sorry.

105
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:10,647
Remodeling.

106
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:13,041
A little courtesy, please!

107
00:07:13,084 --> 00:07:14,956
A little quiet!

108
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:16,740
Thank you!

109
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:21,049
I swear they are
building an ark.

110
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:29,753
Is this your husband?

111
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:31,015
Yes.

112
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:32,713
Christof.

113
00:07:32,756 --> 00:07:35,542
- When he was young.
- Mm.

114
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:37,457
And is that your daughter?

115
00:07:38,936 --> 00:07:41,548
Yes. Nicola.

116
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:55,562
He taught me how to play.

117
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:57,564
My husband.

118
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:01,742
Liszt was his favorite.

119
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:11,491
Then he began
fluffing the notes.

120
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:16,713
His left hand.

121
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:22,937
He thought it was arthritis.

122
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:27,202
Six months later, he was gone.

123
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,730
They are with you,
and then they are gone.

124
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:35,776
The ones we love.

125
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:41,346
"Liebestraum."
Do you know what it means?

126
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,699
A dream of love.

127
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:50,921
Because that's all
love leaves us with.

128
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:55,491
A dream. A memory.

129
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:05,066
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:08,199
It's my only company these days.

131
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:12,116
Is that your dog?

132
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,554
Oh, yes. Jojo.

133
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:16,599
Long gone as well.

134
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:19,646
Well, have you considered
getting another?

135
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:21,865
Oh, no, I couldn't.

136
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:24,215
I wouldn't know how to choose.

137
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:28,655
Well, I could help you.
If you wanted.

138
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:31,396
- Are you a dog person?
- A little bit.

139
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,269
My mom actually
used to breed them.

140
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:37,185
Thank you, sweetheart,

141
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:41,450
but I don't think
I could manage a dog right now.

142
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:43,321
I hope you are not offended.

143
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:45,323
Not at all.

144
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:49,414
But if you change your mind,
just, uh, let me know.

145
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,634
Do I have your phone number?

146
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:53,157
No.

147
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:08,956
I never know
how to work these things.

148
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:11,045
Here, let me help you.

149
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:22,230
It was actually
a really spiritual experience.

150
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:24,624
They cleanse your soul,
not just your butt,

151
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:28,410
to the sound of shamanic
singing bowls and pan flutes.

152
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:29,996
Please be kidding.

153
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,675
You should come with me next time.
Nope.

154
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,546
- I ordered takeout.
- Wait.

155
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,940
- While they were up your...?
- No, God!

156
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:38,855
Gross. For now, for dinner.

157
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:40,857
Oh.

158
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:44,034
Oh, thank God. I'm starving.

159
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,648
Yeah, apartment 4B.

160
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:51,389
Uh, Greta?

161
00:10:52,434 --> 00:10:54,436
Oh.

162
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,830
Hey.

163
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:58,570
Sorry to bother you, sweetheart.

164
00:10:58,614 --> 00:11:00,529
Am I calling at a bad time?

165
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:03,488
No, no, not at all. How are you?

166
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:05,665
I've been thinking about

167
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,928
what you said
about the dog, and...

168
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:12,584
I thought, if you wouldn't
mind coming, it...

169
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:15,718
it might not be
such a bad idea after all.

170
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:17,633
Yeah, of course.

171
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,896
When, uh...
when do you want to go?

172
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,376
Saturday morning?

173
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,465
Is 10:00 too early?

174
00:11:23,508 --> 00:11:25,902
Uh, no, 10:00's fine.
I'll see you then.

175
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:29,732
Did I just snort crystal meth,

176
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:32,648
or did you just offer to go
dog shopping with an old lady?

177
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,041
I know.

178
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:37,174
This city is gonna
eat you alive.

179
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:40,090
So, how long

180
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:41,633
do you keep them here?

181
00:11:41,657 --> 00:11:43,703
- Five days.
- And then?

182
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:47,271
If nobody claims their dogs,
they're PTS.

183
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:50,100
- PTS?
- Put to sleep.

184
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:53,277
Oh. What a dreadful euphemism.

185
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,629
And so, which of these
is next for the...

186
00:11:57,673 --> 00:11:59,849
PTS treatment?

187
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:01,764
Um...

188
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:05,812
This is Morton.

189
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:07,639
Today is Morton's last day.

190
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:09,729
Oh.

191
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:11,731
- May I come in?
- Mm-hmm.

192
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:25,614
Come on.

193
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,574
Come on, Morton.

194
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:33,709
You don't want to end up
a euphemism, do you?

195
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,929
Morton...

196
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:37,844
I'm taking you home.

197
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:48,985
Smile.

198
00:12:51,248 --> 00:12:52,989
Great.

199
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:57,124
Oh, goodness.

200
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:59,126
I had no idea it could do this.

201
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:02,825
I know. The, uh, wonders
of technology, huh?

202
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:04,784
Oh, um, if you want to send it

203
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:07,177
to your daughter,
it's actually pretty easy.

204
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:09,701
You just click this,
and then share.

205
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:11,529
Oh.

206
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:14,750
You're close to your mother,
I can tell.

207
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,100
Mm.

208
00:13:17,144 --> 00:13:19,581
She actually passed away.

209
00:13:21,148 --> 00:13:23,454
Last year.

210
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:25,326
Oh, Frances.

211
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,807
Yeah.

212
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,809
Why didn't you tell me?

213
00:13:31,332 --> 00:13:33,421
It's like you said.

214
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:37,251
I'm left with this...

215
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:40,689
this dream of her,

216
00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:43,866
and I don't want her to fade.

217
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,086
It won't.

218
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:49,829
If you keep it... here.

219
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:53,180
In your heart.

220
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,336
It's okay to light a candle,
even if you don't really...

221
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:04,381
practice.

222
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:08,559
I'm sure it is.

223
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:12,520
Christof used to play
the organ here.

224
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,871
Every Friday.

225
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,570
Today's a Friday.

226
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:21,311
I know.

227
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:31,017
For the ones that are gone.

228
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:35,978
Yes?

229
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:37,937
Nothing has changed.

230
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,722
Still the same racket
from the window.

231
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:42,506
Listen.

232
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:50,558
Love you, too.

233
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:51,776
Ciao.

234
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,086
- Nicola, she used to go here.
- Mm.

235
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,176
The youngest-ever winner
of the Little Mozart.

236
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,526
And where is she now?

237
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,920
Paris.

238
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,270
I would have loved Juilliard
for her.

239
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:09,751
Mm, uh, still,
the Conservatoire de Paris

240
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:11,971
is not to be...

241
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,973
How-how do you say that?

242
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:15,496
Sneezed at?

243
00:16:17,672 --> 00:16:19,804
Uh, you must miss her terribly.

244
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:22,024
Oh, I get by.

245
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:24,026
One way or another.

246
00:16:27,116 --> 00:16:29,336
You don't have to be lonely.

247
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,992
Oh, my dear.

248
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:35,777
Even you'll be gone soon.

249
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:42,088
You know, my friends say, uh...

250
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:43,872
I'm like chewing gum.

251
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:47,876
Chewing gum?

252
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,009
I tend to stick around.

253
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:54,578
You promise?

254
00:16:54,622 --> 00:16:56,624
I promise.

255
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,674
So, remember Simon Porter?

256
00:17:03,718 --> 00:17:05,633
Uh...

257
00:17:06,764 --> 00:17:08,244
Um...

258
00:17:08,288 --> 00:17:10,420
Chin fuzz, sideburns,

259
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:13,293
dad works at The New York Times?

260
00:17:13,336 --> 00:17:15,469
No, absolutely no clue.

261
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:17,253
Okay, well, he remembers you.

262
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:19,690
He's having a party tonight,
and we're going.

263
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:22,867
I am wearing these.

264
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:25,609
- What, are they bad?
- No, they're great.

265
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:27,611
They're disgusting.
You want to puke.

266
00:17:27,655 --> 00:17:30,179
Erica, they're perfect, okay?
I just can't go.

267
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:33,095
I already made plans with, uh,
Greta to have dinner.

268
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:35,010
Seriously?

269
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,839
You'd rather have dinner
with Cruella than your friends?

270
00:17:37,882 --> 00:17:40,102
That's mean.
And they're not my friends.

271
00:17:40,146 --> 00:17:41,973
Hey. I am.

272
00:17:42,017 --> 00:17:45,281
Well, I'm sorry, but I made
these plans last week, so...

273
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:47,501
Come on. Please. I'll call her.

274
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:50,591
- Do you want me to call her?
- Erica, I can't go.

275
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:53,942
I have to be there in, like,
30 minutes, so no.

276
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,901
What?

277
00:17:57,946 --> 00:17:59,600
What?

278
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:02,646
I wasn't gonna say anything,
but this is just...

279
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,084
it's getting weird.

280
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,477
You, like,
totally adopted this woman.

281
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,525
She's my friend.

282
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:14,876
You hardly know her.

283
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:16,399
Okay, I'm gonna call her.
That's it.

284
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:18,097
And we're putting her
on a serious taper,

285
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,020
- starting tomorrow.
- No, Erica. What the hell?

286
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:21,337
Why do you always think
that you can

287
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:22,840
just tell me what to do?

288
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:24,886
Right, I'm just some
superficial bitch.

289
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:26,540
But I don't see how making

290
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,369
some random lady
your surrogate mom is normal.

291
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:31,284
- Excuse me?
- You're gonna pretend

292
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:33,329
that that's not
what's going on here?

293
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:35,592
It's so obvious, it's sad.

294
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:37,377
She's not your mother.

295
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:43,905

that you just said that to me.

No, I think I should
just go home.

335
00:21:35,903 --> 00:21:38,645
We haven't had dessert.

336
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,603
That's okay.

337
00:21:44,781 --> 00:21:47,131
Uh, I'll pack you a-a plate,
if you want.

338
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:49,525
No, no, it's-it's totally fine.

339
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:54,182
- It's no bother.
- Greta, really, it's fine.

340
00:21:54,225 --> 00:21:56,053
Are you sure?
It will just take a moment.

341
00:21:56,097 --> 00:21:57,707
I'm sure.

342
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:03,583
Is there anything I can do?

343
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:05,628
Tell me where it hurts.

344
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,676
I just need to go home.

345
00:22:18,946 --> 00:22:20,730
Use the key.

346
00:22:20,774 --> 00:22:23,559
In the bowl.

347
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:48,802
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

348
00:22:48,845 --> 00:22:50,456
I mean, I guess
she's been, what,

349
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:52,719
purposely planting them
around the city?

350
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:56,113
Just hoping someone
brings them back to her?

351
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:59,682
- And you did.
- Yeah, I did.

352
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:04,905
That's the creepiest
thing I've ever heard.

353
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:24,751
Here you go. Table five.

354
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:26,622
Hurry up.

355
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:47,643
Hey, she's really
freaking me out.

356
00:23:47,687 --> 00:23:49,819
Yeah, tell me about it.

357
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:52,909
- She called there, too?
- Only, like, 80 times.

358
00:23:52,953 --> 00:23:54,563
I had to unplug the phone.

359
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:57,174
Oh, my God,
I just want her to go away.

360
00:23:57,218 --> 00:23:59,133
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
it's not that easy,

361
00:23:59,176 --> 00:24:01,352
especially if
they don't want to go.

362
00:24:01,396 --> 00:24:03,093
And do you want to know
the kicker?

363
00:24:03,137 --> 00:24:04,965
What's the kicker?

364
00:24:05,008 --> 00:24:07,010
The crazier they are,
the harder they cling.

365
00:24:07,054 --> 00:24:08,490
Don't tell me that.

366
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:10,361
Then I also won't tell you
that I tried

367
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:12,363
- to warn you about her.
- I know.

368
00:24:12,407 --> 00:24:14,627
Goddamn it, why didn't I just
listen to you?

369
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,716
You never do.

370
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:19,022
Well, from now on,
I swear to God,

371
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:21,024
I'll do whatever
you tell me to do.

372
00:24:21,068 --> 00:24:23,070
There's somebody asking for you.

373
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:27,248
- Who?
- A woman.

374
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:31,382
Oh, my God, Erica,
I think she's here.

375
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:33,863
- Shit.
- I'll call you later.

376
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,312
Can you get rid of her?

377
00:24:48,356 --> 00:24:51,315
I tried.
She said she needed to see you.

378
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,057
I don't want to talk to her.

379
00:24:54,101 --> 00:24:55,972
- Look, Francine...
- It's Frances.

380
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:58,497
I'm not your public relations
manager, understand?

381
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,107
Just get rid of her.

382
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,152
And I don't want a scene.

383
00:25:11,422 --> 00:25:14,121
Greta, what are you doing here?

384
00:25:14,164 --> 00:25:16,906
I was worried.
You didn't answer your phone.

385
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,127
- I left you some messages.
- I got them.

386
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,521
- What do you want?
- Sweetheart, I...

387
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:25,132
- Don't.
- What?

388
00:25:25,175 --> 00:25:27,047
Don't call me that.

389
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:31,878
What's wrong?

390
00:25:33,793 --> 00:25:35,708
What is it?

391
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:38,972
- Ma chérie...
- Stop calling me that.

392
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:41,540
Tell me what's wrong.

393
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,368
Come on, Greta.

394
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:47,850
I saw them.

395
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:51,854
The bags in the closet, Greta.

396
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:53,987
I saw them.

397
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,511
What, you go...
you go planting them around,

398
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,687
hoping some lost soul's gonna
bring them back to you?

399
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:00,776
Trying to find the biggest
sucker in New York City?

400
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,778
Well, congratulations.
You found her.

401
00:26:02,822 --> 00:26:04,563
- Frances.
- God, you're good.

402
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:07,870
You're really, really good.

403
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:10,786
You totally had me.

404
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,049
Thank God I opened
the wrong closet door.

405
00:26:13,093 --> 00:26:15,835
- Will you let me explain?
- No, I won't let you explain.

406
00:26:15,878 --> 00:26:18,098
Because it's over.

407
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:20,230
And I never want
to see you again.

408
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:21,797
Frances, please.

409
00:26:21,841 --> 00:26:24,017
Do not come back here.

410
00:27:14,023 --> 00:27:15,677
Frances?

411
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:18,419
If you would only
let me explain.

412
00:27:18,462 --> 00:27:20,464
What I did was wrong.

413
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:22,379
I know that now.

414
00:27:22,423 --> 00:27:24,773
And it will never happen again.

415
00:27:24,817 --> 00:27:27,341
But since Nicola left,

416
00:27:27,384 --> 00:27:30,692
I have been in
this well of loneliness,

417
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:32,825
this black hole.

418
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:36,785
Maybe it drove me a little mad.

419
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:40,354
We were meant for love, Frances,

420
00:27:40,397 --> 00:27:42,791
not this terrible isolation.

421
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:49,580
And if you don't call me,
I don't know what I will do.

422
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:54,150
Want to work Saturday,
6:00 to close?

423
00:27:54,194 --> 00:27:56,631
Uh, yeah, sure.

424
00:27:58,328 --> 00:28:00,113
Ah...

425
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:03,246
- Okay, go.
- Sorry.

426
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,770
Go, go, go.

427
00:28:07,294 --> 00:28:08,861
If those are mine,

428
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:11,124
I'm gonna dry-hump you
right here.

429
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:13,039
I wish.

430
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:15,171
Frances McCullen?

431
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:27,836
I can't accept those.

432
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,969
White lilies.

433
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:33,929
I'm sorry.

434
00:28:43,678 --> 00:28:44,940
Oh!

435
00:28:44,984 --> 00:28:47,377
- Uh... uh...
- I'm so sorry.

436
00:28:47,421 --> 00:28:49,728
Um, did any of it get on you?

437
00:28:51,338 --> 00:28:53,035
I will get you
a new glass immediately.

438
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,689
I'm very, very, very sorry.

439
00:28:56,343 --> 00:29:00,173
Uh, uh, I'll be right back
with your other glass.

440
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:17,712
Call the cops.

441
00:29:19,932 --> 00:29:21,760
This is not a problem?

442
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:24,588
So she can just stand there
and stare at me all day,

443
00:29:24,632 --> 00:29:26,982
and that's not a problem?
Everything's cool?

444
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:30,769
Across the street?
Yeah, pretty much.

445
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:32,858
How is that not harassment?

446
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:34,511
Ma'am, technically,
she can stand there

447
00:29:34,555 --> 00:29:36,296
with a telephoto lens
and a tripod

448
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:38,167
and take your picture
if she wants to.

449
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:41,431
Public area,
her rights are protected.

450
00:29:43,085 --> 00:29:45,261
Awesome.

451
00:29:45,305 --> 00:29:47,481
Ignore her.

452
00:29:47,524 --> 00:29:49,613
She's just looking
for attention.

453
00:29:49,657 --> 00:29:53,400
The more you give her,
the more she'll want back.

454
00:29:58,361 --> 00:30:00,886
- Well, that was easy.
- Ma'am.

455
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:16,352
I said I was sorry.

456
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:19,616
Please talk to me!

457
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,358
I said I was sorry.
Just tell me what you want...

458
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:05,227
Please.

459
00:32:05,271 --> 00:32:07,012
Jesus! What...?

460
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:10,189
God, what do you...
what do you want from me?

461
00:32:10,232 --> 00:32:12,104
I want to talk.

462
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:14,410
Then talk to your daughter.

463
00:32:14,454 --> 00:32:17,544
I can't.
She does not understand.

464
00:32:17,587 --> 00:32:19,198
What?

465
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:22,984
- What doesn't she understand?
- I'm lonely.

466
00:32:23,028 --> 00:32:25,247
Greta, everybody's lonely.

467
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:27,597
That does not mean that you get
to follow people around

468
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:29,338
and terrorize them.

469
00:32:29,382 --> 00:32:31,558
Everybody needs a friend.

470
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:34,039
- You have your Erica.
- No.

471
00:32:34,082 --> 00:32:36,780
No, you leave Erica out of this.

472
00:32:41,394 --> 00:32:44,919
You said you always
stick around like chewing gum.

473
00:32:49,402 --> 00:32:51,012
Are you insane?

474
00:32:51,056 --> 00:32:52,666
Please.

475
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:55,974
Let's try and start again.

476
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:58,324
I love you.

477
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:00,587
You don't even know me.

478
00:33:04,547 --> 00:33:06,897
I tried to talk to you. I tried.

479
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:10,814
But you wouldn't listen.

480
00:33:12,686 --> 00:33:15,776
People can't keep
doing this to me.

481
00:33:24,263 --> 00:33:27,875
Ugh, I can't believe
she did this.

482
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,404
Harassment restraining order

483
00:33:35,448 --> 00:33:38,755
can be applied for
in certain circumstances.

484
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,020
- Is there any physical assault?
- She threw gum in her hair.

485
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:43,412
Chewing gum?

486
00:33:43,456 --> 00:33:44,848
A restraining order.

487
00:33:44,892 --> 00:33:46,372
How could I apply for one?

488
00:33:46,415 --> 00:33:47,808
You file
a petitioner's affidavit

489
00:33:47,851 --> 00:33:49,003
before the court administrator.

490
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,593
Once the filing fee is paid,

491
00:33:50,637 --> 00:33:52,378
it's forwarded
to the judge for review.

492
00:33:52,421 --> 00:33:54,249
The judge may then
schedule a hearing.

493
00:33:54,293 --> 00:33:55,990
And how long could that take?

494
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,209
It's Manhattan.

495
00:33:57,252 --> 00:33:59,211
The courts are overcrowded.

496
00:33:59,254 --> 00:34:02,301
- How long?
- It could take months.

497
00:34:02,344 --> 00:34:04,694
Instructions for filing
are online.

498
00:34:14,443 --> 00:34:16,532
In order to remove a dog

499
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:19,840
from the home, SPCA would need
proof of mistreatment,

500
00:34:19,883 --> 00:34:22,451
like photos
or witness statements.

501
00:34:22,495 --> 00:34:24,279
What if I don't have any proof

502
00:34:24,323 --> 00:34:27,630
but I'm worried about
the dog's safety?

503
00:34:27,674 --> 00:34:29,763
You talking about
that sweet French lady

504
00:34:29,806 --> 00:34:32,374
that you came here with?

505
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:34,115
I'm just frightened.

506
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,161
For the dog.

507
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:43,445
I thought you were in Paris.

508
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:45,230
The customer you have called

509
00:35:45,273 --> 00:35:47,014
is unavailable
to take your call.

510
00:35:47,057 --> 00:35:48,842
Please leave a message
after the tone.

511
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:51,105
Hi. This is Frances McCullen.

512
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,369
I'm trying to get in contact
with Nicola Hideg,

513
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:57,067
Greta Hideg's daughter.

514
00:35:57,111 --> 00:35:59,766
Uh, you see,
I helped her adopt a dog,

515
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:01,550
and I'm worried.

516
00:36:49,816 --> 00:36:51,513
Erica?

517
00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:09,531
God.

518
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:25,721
Hello?

519
00:37:25,765 --> 00:37:28,246
Hey, where are you?

520
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:30,944
- Where should I be?
- Chester's.

521
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,642
Oh, crap.

522
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:35,688
I totally flaked. I'm sorry.

523
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:37,361
We're-we're still here.

524
00:37:37,385 --> 00:37:39,431
- Come hang out.
- No, it's okay.

525
00:37:39,474 --> 00:37:42,216
I'm gonna stay in tonight.

526
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,653
Are you okay?

527
00:37:44,697 --> 00:37:46,438
Yeah, I'm fine.

528
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:48,918
Just, uh... I'm tired.

529
00:37:50,355 --> 00:37:52,226
But I'll-I'll see you
when you get back.

530
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,489
- Okay.
- Bye.

531
00:38:33,485 --> 00:38:35,225
Hey, Papa.

532
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:37,402
You haven't
called me that in a while.

533
00:38:37,445 --> 00:38:39,404
Uh...

534
00:38:39,447 --> 00:38:42,755
Sorry. It, uh... it slipped.

535
00:38:42,798 --> 00:38:44,496
Maybe I should quit
while I'm ahead.

536
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:47,063
Maybe you should.

537
00:38:47,107 --> 00:38:49,022
How are you doing?

538
00:38:49,065 --> 00:38:51,416
I don't know.

539
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:56,725
Been thinking about
maybe going away.

540
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:59,206
Might be good
to think some things over.

541
00:38:59,249 --> 00:39:01,295
Can I come, too?

542
00:39:02,775 --> 00:39:04,254
Just you and me?

543
00:39:04,298 --> 00:39:05,908
You're just mad at me

544
00:39:05,952 --> 00:39:07,910
because I found a way
to move on.

545
00:39:07,954 --> 00:39:09,434
Is that what it's called?

546
00:39:09,477 --> 00:39:11,305
Did it ever occur to you

547
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,568
that your mom might have
wanted it that way?

548
00:39:13,612 --> 00:39:15,048
Come on.

549
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:16,832
I-I mean, for both of us.

550
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:19,052
So that we could just
get on with our lives.

551
00:39:19,095 --> 00:39:20,749
Is that supposed
to make this better?

552
00:39:20,793 --> 00:39:22,272
I'm not a perfect man.

553
00:39:22,316 --> 00:39:24,057
Which is fine, except now

554
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,146
you're quoting
Bill Clinton, so...

555
00:39:26,189 --> 00:39:27,408
Look,

556
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:29,932
we've both been through so much.

557
00:39:29,976 --> 00:39:31,673
This hasn't been easy
on either of us.

558
00:39:31,717 --> 00:39:33,762
And I miss her
as much as you do.

559
00:39:33,806 --> 00:39:35,416
Frances?

560
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,549
Dad, I got to call you back.

561
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:39,768
- Right now?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

562
00:39:59,092 --> 00:40:00,659
- Frankie?
- Erica, Jesus Christ.

563
00:40:00,702 --> 00:40:02,878
- What's the matter?
- Greta... she's there.

564
00:40:02,922 --> 00:40:04,445
She's sending me
pictures of you.

565
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:06,360
What?

566
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,362
You got to get out of there.
Actually, no, no.

567
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,774
Don't go alone.
Is anybody with you?

568
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:12,540
I've looked around.
Nobody's here.

569
00:40:12,584 --> 00:40:14,324
- Where are you?
- Don't worry.

570
00:40:14,368 --> 00:40:16,936
I'm leaving.
It was a bore fest anyways.

571
00:40:16,979 --> 00:40:19,199
Oh, my God, Erica.

572
00:40:19,242 --> 00:40:20,481
No, no, no.
She's still following you.

573
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:22,724
She's literally going
out the door right now.

574
00:40:22,768 --> 00:40:24,987
She can't be.
I slipped out the back.

575
00:40:25,031 --> 00:40:28,077
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

576
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:30,732
Take a deep breath. Relax, okay?

577
00:40:32,038 --> 00:40:33,779
God, this is such bullshit.

578
00:40:33,822 --> 00:40:35,215
I mean, she can't do this.

579
00:40:35,258 --> 00:40:37,173
I'm gonna go to the cops
tomorrow, and I'm gonna

580
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:38,586
- hire an attorney.
- Go, Frankie Mac.

581
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,438
I mean,
it's one thing to harass me,

582
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:41,806
but to threaten my friend,
she can...

583
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,963
You there?

584
00:40:44,006 --> 00:40:45,704
She's still following you.
Turn around.

585
00:40:47,662 --> 00:40:50,404
- I don't see anyone.
- You're-you're...

586
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,145
you're in an alleyway,
and there's some

587
00:40:52,188 --> 00:40:54,539
big billboard behind you,
and you're still on the phone.

588
00:40:54,582 --> 00:40:56,192
That's right in front of me.

589
00:40:57,542 --> 00:40:58,760
Jesus Christ.

590
00:40:58,804 --> 00:41:00,545
You have to get out of there.

591
00:41:01,633 --> 00:41:03,635
Erica?

592
00:41:03,678 --> 00:41:05,767
Hello?

593
00:41:05,811 --> 00:41:08,422
Okay, calm down, Frankie.
I've gotten out of there.

594
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,989
Where are you?

595
00:41:10,032 --> 00:41:12,208
I'm taking the goddamn subway.

596
00:41:12,252 --> 00:41:13,732
She's right behind you.

597
00:41:13,775 --> 00:41:15,255
Turn around.

598
00:41:16,299 --> 00:41:17,866
She can't be.

599
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,914
You bitch.

600
00:41:21,957 --> 00:41:23,916
She's still following you.

601
00:41:23,959 --> 00:41:25,918
I don't see her.

602
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:28,137
I'm just gonna take
an Uber, okay?

603
00:41:32,011 --> 00:41:33,403
A bus just pulled up.

604
00:41:33,447 --> 00:41:34,990
I can't believe myself,
but I'm getting on.

605
00:41:35,014 --> 00:41:36,145
Go. Run.

606
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:39,409
- Erica?
- I'm on.

607
00:41:39,453 --> 00:41:42,761
- Watch for her.
- I will.

608
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:47,243
Okay, we're good.

609
00:41:48,593 --> 00:41:50,595
Erica, she's on the bus.

610
00:41:50,638 --> 00:41:52,422
What?

611
00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:58,516
You need help.

612
00:41:58,559 --> 00:41:59,995
Erica, don't talk to her!

613
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:02,258
You're pathetic!
Excuse me, I have to get off.

614
00:42:02,302 --> 00:42:03,869
Erica, get off the bus.

615
00:42:03,912 --> 00:42:06,698
- Okay, I'm off.
- Where are you?

616
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:09,527
Uh, I-I don't know.
Somewhere on 33rd.

617
00:42:12,138 --> 00:42:14,619
Uh, there's a bar up ahead,
the Copper House.

618
00:42:14,662 --> 00:42:18,274
Copper House.
It's a left on 33rd from here.

619
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:19,493
And hurry, please.

620
00:42:32,637 --> 00:42:34,552
You sick bitch.

621
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:36,379
Oh, my God!

622
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,425
Erica!

623
00:42:41,776 --> 00:42:42,821
Erica.

624
00:42:42,864 --> 00:42:44,300
Oh, my God. Hi.

625
00:42:49,392 --> 00:42:52,091
This chick is
seriously disturbed.

626
00:42:55,877 --> 00:42:58,358
I do have to admit, though,
she takes a good photo.

627
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:00,055
I mean, I look badass.

628
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:02,188
Erica, come on.

629
00:43:12,546 --> 00:43:14,417
Hello?

630
00:43:14,461 --> 00:43:16,594
Hi.

631
00:43:16,637 --> 00:43:19,640
Um, this isn't gonna be easy,

632
00:43:19,684 --> 00:43:22,077
but maybe we should meet.

00:43:51,585 --> 00:43:54,457
Um... yeah.

640
00:43:56,938 --> 00:43:59,941
You called me about Nicola?

641
00:44:01,595 --> 00:44:03,510
I'm Alexa.

642
00:44:03,553 --> 00:44:05,512
Alexa Hammond.

643
00:44:05,555 --> 00:44:07,645
Do you want to...?

644
00:44:13,563 --> 00:44:16,479
Nicola Hideg is dead.

645
00:44:18,481 --> 00:44:21,310
She killed herself
four years ago.

646
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,709
Uh, I knew her from A.A.

647
00:44:28,753 --> 00:44:31,538
I was her addiction counselor,

648
00:44:31,581 --> 00:44:34,628
and then her partner
for six years.

649
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,849
- But, uh, I could nev...
- Um...

650
00:44:37,892 --> 00:44:40,895
I-I'm sorry, but...

651
00:44:40,939 --> 00:44:43,593
what about Paris?

652
00:44:44,769 --> 00:44:47,293
- Paris?
- Yeah.

653
00:44:47,336 --> 00:44:51,471
Greta said that she studied at
the... the conservatory there.

654
00:44:52,733 --> 00:44:54,996
Nicola had never been to France.

655
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,086
Listen, that whole
French shtick of Greta's

656
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:00,262
is an affectation, all right?

657
00:45:00,306 --> 00:45:02,351
She's from Hungary.

658
00:45:05,267 --> 00:45:08,314
You know, Greta...

659
00:45:08,357 --> 00:45:11,709
she still pretends
to talk to her.

660
00:45:11,752 --> 00:45:13,754
On the phone.

661
00:45:13,798 --> 00:45:16,496
She's a very ill woman.

662
00:45:16,539 --> 00:45:21,501
So, Nicola never studied
the piano or anything?

663
00:45:21,544 --> 00:45:25,157
She used to play
till her knuckles bled.

664
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:28,290
You can't save people.

665
00:45:28,334 --> 00:45:31,424
You know, I couldn't
save her from...

666
00:45:31,467 --> 00:45:35,645
whatever it was
that had been done to her.

667
00:45:35,689 --> 00:45:38,910
You know, maybe she just
couldn't survive the box.

668
00:45:38,953 --> 00:45:40,781
The box?

669
00:45:42,435 --> 00:45:44,829
I used to think
it was a metaphor.

670
00:45:44,872 --> 00:45:48,136
You know, the box
in which she was confined

671
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:51,226
as a child or whatever.

672
00:45:52,662 --> 00:45:56,536
But I came to realize
before the end...

673
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,453
that maybe I was wrong.

674
00:46:02,237 --> 00:46:04,413
I was speaking with Erica.

675
00:46:04,457 --> 00:46:05,806
Dad.

676
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:08,069
She told me
what's been going on.

677
00:46:08,113 --> 00:46:10,202
You keep telling me
everything is okay.

678
00:46:10,245 --> 00:46:12,334
I am okay. I...

679
00:46:12,378 --> 00:46:14,467
I'm an adult.

680
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:16,774
So talk to me like I'm an adult.

681
00:46:16,817 --> 00:46:18,993
Okay, like an adult.

682
00:46:19,037 --> 00:46:21,474
This woman is unstable.

683
00:46:21,517 --> 00:46:24,390
You need to cut her off
entirely.

684
00:46:24,433 --> 00:46:26,435
I already have cut her off.

685
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:32,877
Look, Dad,
I'll call you back later.

686
00:46:42,538 --> 00:46:45,890
Hi. I'm Frances, and I'll be
your waitress for the evening.

687
00:46:45,933 --> 00:46:50,808
A Kir Royale and some
sparkling water, ma chérie.

688
00:46:50,851 --> 00:46:52,897
No, I-I...

689
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,376
I'm sorry. I-I can't do this.

690
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,074
But I've reserved, my dear.

691
00:46:56,117 --> 00:46:58,685
- What do you mean, you can't?
- Is there a problem?

692
00:46:58,728 --> 00:47:00,184
Yes, this woman
has been harassing me.

693
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:01,644
You need to ask her to leave.

694
00:47:01,688 --> 00:47:02,994
I'm afraid
she has a reservation.

695
00:47:03,037 --> 00:47:04,909
What kind of service is this?

696
00:47:04,952 --> 00:47:06,475
How can I help you, madam?

697
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:08,390
A Kir Royale
and a sparkling water.

698
00:47:08,434 --> 00:47:09,914
She has my order.

699
00:47:12,003 --> 00:47:14,440
- Want some Valium with that?
- Yeah. Wouldn't work.

700
00:47:14,483 --> 00:47:17,878
- Is she your stalker?
- Yeah.

701
00:47:17,922 --> 00:47:19,662
Good luck.

702
00:47:33,328 --> 00:47:36,679
I'll start with the crab bisque
and a small green salad.

703
00:47:36,723 --> 00:47:39,857
- Why are you doing this?
- Because we have to talk.

704
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,207
I have nothing to say to you.

705
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:45,732
Nothing? After all
we've been through together?

706
00:47:46,907 --> 00:47:48,822
And the sea bream to follow.

707
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,825
- It's palatable?
- It's excellent.

708
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,740
A glass of something
white and dry.

709
00:47:54,828 --> 00:47:56,308
The pinot grigio.

710
00:47:56,351 --> 00:47:58,745
No. Something French.

711
00:47:58,788 --> 00:48:00,312
The Chablis.

712
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,836
If you say so.

713
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,446
Chérie.

714
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:07,232
- Do not call me that.
- Et pourquoi pas?

715
00:48:07,275 --> 00:48:10,278
My darling. Ma chérie.

716
00:48:10,322 --> 00:48:12,150
Why are you speaking French?

717
00:48:22,421 --> 00:48:25,511
- Was she talking Klingon?
- Call the cops.

718
00:48:25,554 --> 00:48:28,514
- Henri won't like that.
- I don't care. Just call them.

719
00:48:28,557 --> 00:48:30,298
Your funeral.

720
00:48:48,751 --> 00:48:50,318
The Chablis.

721
00:48:50,362 --> 00:48:52,581
May I?

722
00:48:55,497 --> 00:48:57,586
Mm...

723
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:59,284
A bit like you.

724
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:01,286
Promises a lot,
then disappoints.

725
00:49:01,329 --> 00:49:02,983
Okay.

726
00:49:03,027 --> 00:49:04,854
I deserve better!

727
00:49:07,509 --> 00:49:09,555
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

728
00:49:09,598 --> 00:49:11,600
You can't do this to me. To us.

729
00:49:11,644 --> 00:49:13,341
- Are you a child?
- No, you're the child.

730
00:49:13,385 --> 00:49:16,170
You need someone to love.
You need a mother to hold you.

731
00:49:16,214 --> 00:49:17,955
You lost someone,
and you're afraid to love.

732
00:49:17,998 --> 00:49:19,497
- We both know it's true.
- Don't you dare

733
00:49:19,521 --> 00:49:20,609
talk to me about my mother.

734
00:49:20,653 --> 00:49:21,959
Darling, don't you understand?

735
00:49:22,002 --> 00:49:23,569
She had to die.

736
00:49:23,612 --> 00:49:25,136
She had to die for us to meet!

737
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:26,354
Are you out of your mind?

738
00:49:26,398 --> 00:49:27,834
You just can't accept it!

739
00:49:27,877 --> 00:49:29,270
Look at her! She's full of loss!

740
00:49:29,314 --> 00:49:30,489
Of grieving!

741
00:49:30,532 --> 00:49:32,186
She's gone, Frances!

742
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:35,189
Just accept it!
It's called moving on!

743
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,802
Leave me alone! She's gone!

744
00:49:39,846 --> 00:49:42,675
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

745
00:49:47,027 --> 00:49:49,334
Leave me alone!

746
00:50:04,088 --> 00:50:06,438
I should just try
and ignore her, right?

747
00:50:22,106 --> 00:50:23,803
And how am I supposed
to take precautions

748
00:50:23,846 --> 00:50:25,326
when you're not even
gonna tell me

749
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:27,633
whether or not
she's been released?

750
00:50:29,461 --> 00:50:31,071
Oh, my God.

751
00:50:31,115 --> 00:50:33,204
You already released her,
didn't you?

752
00:50:35,206 --> 00:50:38,296
Okay, yeah, yeah, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

753
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:40,080
Goddamn it.

754
00:50:44,432 --> 00:50:46,869
My dad wants to come pick me up.

755
00:50:49,263 --> 00:50:51,004
Okay.

756
00:50:52,788 --> 00:50:54,616
Okay?

757
00:50:56,618 --> 00:50:58,185
I think you should go.

758
00:50:59,404 --> 00:51:01,710
What, just leave?

759
00:51:04,148 --> 00:51:08,456
Come away with me, then,
if the family thing's too much.

760
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,110
We can go to Baja.

761
00:51:10,154 --> 00:51:12,373
It's cheap.

762
00:51:12,417 --> 00:51:15,376
Yeah, but she'd still be here...

763
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,378
the minute we got back.

764
00:51:21,991 --> 00:51:24,081
Well, then...

765
00:51:24,124 --> 00:51:26,213
guess you'll have to try
the slow fade.

766
00:51:26,257 --> 00:51:28,128
What's that?

767
00:51:28,172 --> 00:51:29,869
You apologize,

768
00:51:29,912 --> 00:51:32,698
tell her the problem
is you, not her,

769
00:51:32,741 --> 00:51:35,701
and that you have to go
and deal with your, um, issues.

770
00:51:35,744 --> 00:51:37,268
By the time that you're back,

771
00:51:37,311 --> 00:51:39,792
she'll have moved on
to someone else.

772
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,143
So...

773
00:51:43,187 --> 00:51:46,146
lie, in other words?

774
00:51:47,713 --> 00:51:49,323
Right to her face.

775
00:51:49,367 --> 00:51:51,020
I'll take you through it.

776
00:51:51,064 --> 00:51:53,545
I'm the master of the slow fade.

777
00:52:29,537 --> 00:52:31,539
It's Friday.

778
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:39,199
Greta, I'm sorry.

779
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:43,160
I know you are, dear.

780
00:52:45,988 --> 00:52:48,121
You were right.

781
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:51,777
I do care.

782
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:57,826
I've just been so upset
about my mom,

783
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:00,960
and I was blaming you.

784
00:53:11,884 --> 00:53:14,539
I'm gonna go away tomorrow.

785
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,151
Just for a little bit.

786
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:21,067
Think some things over.

787
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:44,003
You've been such a help.

788
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:49,269
A friend
when I needed one the most.

789
00:53:51,315 --> 00:53:53,882
Everyone needs a friend.

790
00:53:53,926 --> 00:53:56,885
But we're more
than friends, Frances.

791
00:53:56,929 --> 00:53:58,887
We're connected.

792
00:53:58,931 --> 00:54:01,194
We're family.

793
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,065
I know.

794
00:54:04,502 --> 00:54:08,288
And what does every child need?

795
00:54:13,902 --> 00:54:16,078
A mother.

796
00:54:25,131 --> 00:54:27,089
So we'll meet
when you come back?

797
00:54:27,133 --> 00:54:29,744
You need packing help?

798
00:54:29,788 --> 00:54:31,703
No.

799
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:38,579
You wouldn't lie to me,
would you?

800
00:54:39,972 --> 00:54:42,017
No.

801
00:54:50,243 --> 00:54:53,333
So it's not goodbye, darling.

802
00:54:58,991 --> 00:55:01,298
Don't I deserve a hug?

803
00:55:40,815 --> 00:55:44,950
Maybe that was goodbye, Morton.

Erica, did you water the plants?

Erica isn't here, dear,

I am.

820
00:58:14,969 --> 00:58:17,711
It seems you forgot to pack.

821
00:58:19,278 --> 00:58:23,587
Now, which shoes
would you like to bring?

822
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:28,330
Sir, can you help me?

823
00:58:28,374 --> 00:58:30,202
- My niece, she's very ill.

01:16:12,916 --> 01:16:15,048
You are the only one.

994
01:16:25,232 --> 01:16:28,235
What a pair we are, hmm?

995
01:16:30,411 --> 01:16:32,370
But we can do better.

996
01:16:34,024 --> 01:16:36,026
Can't we?

997
01:16:36,069 --> 01:16:39,072
My darling.

998
01:17:55,801 --> 01:17:57,890
Can I help you?

999
01:17:57,934 --> 01:18:00,414
I'm looking for a Greta Hideg.

1000
01:18:00,458 --> 01:18:01,807
And?

1001
01:18:01,851 --> 01:18:04,157
I was told she lives here.

1002
01:18:04,201 --> 01:18:06,159
She does.

1003
01:18:06,203 --> 01:18:08,248
If you can call it living.

1004
01:18:10,642 --> 01:18:12,165
Sorry.

1005
01:18:12,209 --> 01:18:15,821
- Was meant to be amusing.
- It was amusing.

1006
01:18:15,865 --> 01:18:19,172
Are you a roofer?
A chimney sweep?

1007
01:18:19,216 --> 01:18:20,696
I'm looking
for any information...

1008
01:18:20,739 --> 01:18:23,263
Don't tell me
you're from the IRS.

1009
01:18:23,307 --> 01:18:25,439
On Frances McCullen.

1010
01:18:25,483 --> 01:18:27,528
Do you know her?

1011
01:18:29,617 --> 01:18:31,141
Yes.

1012
01:18:31,184 --> 01:18:33,012
Yes, I know her.

1013
01:18:33,056 --> 01:18:35,362
I haven't seen her in a while.

1014
01:18:35,406 --> 01:18:37,103
Well, I'm a family friend,

1015
01:18:37,147 --> 01:18:39,715
and they haven't heard
from her, either.

1016
01:18:39,758 --> 01:18:41,499
Oh, really?

1017
01:18:42,805 --> 01:18:45,329
Would you like to come in?

1018
01:18:45,372 --> 01:18:47,461
Sure.

1019
01:18:53,076 --> 01:18:54,860
She went on holiday

1020
01:18:54,904 --> 01:18:57,167
with her father, I believe.

1021
01:18:57,210 --> 01:19:00,300
No, she didn't.
That's the reason I'm here.

1022
01:19:06,524 --> 01:19:08,352
I don't get many visitors here.

1023
01:19:08,395 --> 01:19:10,789
Excuse the clutter.

1024
01:19:10,833 --> 01:19:13,183
You're going away?

1025
01:19:13,226 --> 01:19:16,621
Now, are you sure
you're not from the IRS?

1026
01:19:16,664 --> 01:19:19,232
No, I'm not from the IRS.

1027
01:19:19,276 --> 01:19:22,148
They are the only certainties,
aren't they?

1028
01:19:23,889 --> 01:19:25,848
Death and taxes.

1029
01:19:25,891 --> 01:19:27,806
Now, who said that?

1030
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:30,287
I believe it was
Benjamin Franklin.

1031
01:19:30,330 --> 01:19:31,810
But you didn't come all this way

1032
01:19:31,854 --> 01:19:33,290
to talk about taxes, did you?

1033
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:35,205
No. Frances McCullen.

1034
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:46,825
We were acquainted for a while,
and then she went away.

1035
01:19:46,869 --> 01:19:49,175
Poof.

1036
01:19:49,219 --> 01:19:51,699
Not a word.

1037
01:19:51,743 --> 01:19:54,311
But that's young people for you.

1038
01:19:54,354 --> 01:19:56,879
They have their own lives
to lead.

1039
01:19:56,922 --> 01:19:59,185
Please, take a seat.

1040
01:19:59,229 --> 01:20:01,057
Thank you.

1041
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:11,545
Chopin.

1042
01:20:11,589 --> 01:20:13,591
I love Chopin.

1043
01:20:13,634 --> 01:20:15,462
Don't you?

1044
01:20:22,295 --> 01:20:25,211
I like it
when it fills the room.

1045
01:20:27,474 --> 01:20:29,433
She helped me choose Morton.

1046
01:20:29,476 --> 01:20:30,956
Morton?

1047
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,829
Morton, my guard dog.

1048
01:20:33,872 --> 01:20:36,266
Who, by the way,
hasn't been fed for...

1049
01:20:36,309 --> 01:20:38,224
I don't know how long now.

1050
01:20:38,268 --> 01:20:40,357
Forgive me.

1051
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,924
Morton, be quiet.

1052
01:20:46,232 --> 01:20:49,540
Morton, please,
will you keep quiet?

1053
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,501
Morton?

1054
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:58,679
Morton?

1055
01:21:01,378 --> 01:21:03,380
Morton?

1056
01:21:07,036 --> 01:21:09,560
Stop that banging.

1057
01:21:43,463 --> 01:21:45,335
You're not from the IRS?

1058
01:21:45,378 --> 01:21:46,858
Are you sure?

1059
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:50,296
- Maybe Homeland Security?
- You psycho.

1060
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:52,342
We have places
for people like you.

1061
01:21:52,385 --> 01:21:56,215
But all my papers are in order.
I'm a naturalized citizen.

1062
01:21:56,259 --> 01:21:57,366
She's in there, isn't she?

1063
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:58,739
She's having a nap,

1064
01:21:58,783 --> 01:22:00,437
like you will have
in 20 seconds or so.

1065
01:22:04,223 --> 01:22:07,357
I'm taking her with me.

1066
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:08,880
Are you sure?

1067
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:11,100
Help me!

1068
01:22:12,623 --> 01:22:14,059
You don't look too good.

1069
01:22:16,670 --> 01:22:18,411
You missed.

1070
01:22:19,586 --> 01:22:21,675
Missed again.

1071
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:23,895
Ooh.

1072
01:22:40,042 --> 01:22:42,392
Do you have children?

1073
01:22:42,435 --> 01:22:44,481
No? A pity.

1074
01:22:44,524 --> 01:22:46,526

So, tell me,

1120
01:27:25,936 --> 01:27:27,851
how does one become a model?

1121
01:27:27,894 --> 01:27:29,896
Well, you get an agent.

1122
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:34,074
Actually, first you get
a portfolio, then an agent.

1123
01:27:40,864 --> 01:27:42,822
So clumsy.

1124
01:27:42,866 --> 01:27:46,043
Uh, I'll get a towel.

1125
01:27:58,142 --> 01:28:01,537
- Are you okay?
- I...

1126
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:04,801
I feel so strange
all of a sudden.

1127
01:28:04,844 --> 01:28:07,194
What... what kind of strange?

1128
01:28:12,374 --> 01:28:16,160
Do you... do you think that
maybe you've been drugged?

1129
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:21,034
Think that happened
to a friend of mine once.

1131

1132
01:28:28,477 --> 01:28:31,131
- So, what happens now?
- Uh...

1133
01:28:32,568 --> 01:28:35,701
You play me the piano,

1134
01:28:35,745 --> 01:28:40,053
talk about Liszt
and "Liebestraum," right?

1135
01:28:42,534 --> 01:28:44,014
Oh, no.

1136
01:28:44,057 --> 01:28:45,798
You're overdosing.

1137
01:28:45,842 --> 01:28:48,366
Yeah, that's what a bunch
of roofies in your coffee

1138
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:50,020
will do to you.

1139
01:28:50,063 --> 01:28:51,978
You need a doctor.

1140
01:28:52,022 --> 01:28:53,458
And I need my friend.

01:28:58,637 --> 01:28:59,899

1146
01:29:59,002 --> 01:30:01,308
Are you gonna be able to walk?

1147
01:30:01,352 --> 01:30:03,136
I don't know.

01:31:00,019 --> 01:31:01,543
It's just a record.

1159
01:31:09,768 --> 01:31:12,118
How the hell did she...?

1160
01:31:26,829 --> 01:31:29,048
You were the one.

1161
01:31:29,092 --> 01:31:31,486
Stop! Get off of me!

1162
01:31:35,098 --> 01:31:36,578
No.

1163
01:31:37,622 --> 01:31:39,145
No. No, don't do it.

1164
01:31:45,325 --> 01:31:47,632
I have a better idea.

1165
01:31:57,729 --> 01:31:59,949
How do we lock this?

1166
01:32:02,647 --> 01:32:04,910
You could try with this.

1167
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:31,807
What do we do now?

1168
01:32:34,287 --> 01:32:36,289
We call the cops.

1169
01:32:41,381 --> 01:32:43,383
What do we tell them?

1170
01:32:45,211 --> 01:32:49,259
That there's a psychopath
asleep in an old painted box.

1171
01:32:57,180 --> 01:32:59,269
How long have I been here?

1172
01:33:02,185 --> 01:33:03,969
Too long.

1173
01:33:11,150 --> 01:33:13,457
I need to get some air.

1174
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:16,286
Okay.

1175
01:33:16,329 --> 01:33:17,896
Let's go.

1176
01:33:22,292 --> 01:33:24,599
I need to call my dad.

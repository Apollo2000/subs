We're going to win with this dope track.

798
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:57,583
Bish.

799
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:59,041
[chuckles nervously]

800
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:02,750
Uh, well, I don't want to hurt
Jae-bong's feelings...

801
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:05,541
-Okay.
-...but I don't think this track is dope.

802
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:06,958
Bish.

803
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:08,458
But bish,

804
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:09,875
I don't know if you understand.

805
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:12,541
Jae-bong was in Kitty Cat Fancy,

806
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:15,458
one of the biggest K-pop bands
of all time.

807
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:17,291
And I think he knows what's good.

808
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:19,541
Right, bro? Huh?

809
00:39:19,916 --> 00:39:22,125
It's all about the plo, yo.
[popping lips]

810
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:24,375
[imitates gunshot, groans]

811
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:25,666
The what?

812
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:26,750
It's all about the plo.

813
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:28,666
-The flow?
-Flow, I think he said flow.

814
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:29,958
-Flow.
-Flow.

815
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:33,041
-It's all about the flow. Yeah.
-Okay.

816
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,333
Okay.

817
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:38,041
-I'll try. Let's run it again.
-[Lars] Okay. We're all good.

818
00:39:38,666 --> 00:39:41,375
Oh. I am so sorry.
I thought you were over.

819
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:43,458
No, no, no, we are almost finished.

820
00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:47,375
I heard your song.
Your voice is quite special.

821
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:49,666
-You are Iceland, yes?
-Oh.

822
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,416
Yes, we are from Iceland. Yes.

823
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:53,291
You are brother-sister?

824
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:54,791
-No.
-Probably not.

825
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:55,708
No.

826
00:39:56,583 --> 00:40:00,166
You are Alexander Lemtov
and I have heard you singing on the stage.

827
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,958
You sing with such passion.

828
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:04,750
Thank you. Thank you.

829
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:09,208
Listen, I throw smash-up party tonight.
Why don't you come? Be my guests, huh?

830
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:11,291
-Tonight?
-Yes.

831
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:12,375
Um...

832
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:14,083
-Do you...
-We could...

833
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:16,583
The only thing is
we have to finish the remix.

834
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:18,916
This is shame.
All of best performers,

835
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,333
dancers will be there,
very crazy sexy time. You'll love it.

836
00:40:22,416 --> 00:40:23,375
But, you know...

837
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:26,583
first time Eurovision, too much.
I understand. It's okay.

838
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,541
No, wait. Hold... But, please...

839
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:31,291
if the best of the best is going to
be there, then without a doubt,

840
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:33,416
we will be there as well.
There's no question.

841
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,333
All right.

842
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:36,333
Okay, this wonderful. Well...

843
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,208
I see you there. Okay.

844
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:39,416
-Okay.
-Okay.

845
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,500
-Okay.
-[kisses]

846
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:43,458
-[kisses]
-[kisses]

847
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:47,791
-[door closes]
-You have to watch that guy.

848
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:49,125
He is a sex player.

849
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:51,000
Pfft... No.

850
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:52,583
I don't know about that.

851
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:53,625
[Lars] I do.

852
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:56,416
No one travels around
with four guys like that. Come on.

853
00:40:57,083 --> 00:40:58,916
Besides, he's a slick customer.

854
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:00,916
And he probably has a very large penis.

855
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:02,375
Oh, yes, yes.

856
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:04,541
I sense that he does have
a very large penis.

857
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:05,833
I think that's true. Yeah.

858
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:08,708
Yeah. He's got a BDE Hundo P.

859
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:10,666
[smacks lips, scoffs]

860
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,583
[Sigrit] Oh.

861
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:12,791
BDE.

862
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:14,083
-No question.
-No.

863
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:16,625
Well, I think
he's just being friendly, really.

864
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,875
[scoffs]

865
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:19,250
Remember,

866
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:21,208
we don't need friends, okay?

867
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:22,958
We need to win.

868
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:25,041
[dance music playing]

869
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:32,833
-[gasps]
-Wha...

870
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:34,666
[Sigrit] Amazing!

871
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,916
[Lars] Yeah, it looks kind of old to me,
like it's about to fall apart.

872
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:39,375
[both gasp]

873
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:41,625
-Someone just opened our doors.
-Yes.

874
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,333
-Ooh.
-Hello.

875
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:45,333
-Thank you. [chuckles]
-You're welcome.

876
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:48,291
This is very different from our hotel.

877
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:50,375
[indistinct overlapping chatter]

878
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:57,166
Sigrit, Lars, you came.

879
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,166
-This so great.
-Yes.

880
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,833
[kissing]

881
00:42:00,916 --> 00:42:01,916
Lars.

882
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:04,125
Welcome. Welcome.

883
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:06,208
[kissing awkwardly]

884
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:09,958
I'm so happy,
this so great that you are here.

885
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:11,166
Where are we?

886
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,750
This my home.

887
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:14,125
-Yes. Yes.
-Wow.

888
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:17,000
I have many home all over world,
but this crazy place,

889
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:19,625
maybe my top five favorite.

890
00:42:19,708 --> 00:42:20,541
Yes.

891
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:22,916
The penises on the Greek statues...

892
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,958
-Yeah.
-...they are very dangly.

893
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:30,208
Yes, I love the history and this just
the way the Ancient Greek make statues.

894
00:42:30,291 --> 00:42:32,416
So these are Ancient Greek statues?

895
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,625
Yes, of course.

896
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,791
-That's was my question, too. Yes.
-Yeah.

897
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:37,791
Because I was thinking...

898
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:42,000
-that their faces kind of look like yours.
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.

899
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:47,708
-Maybe you're right. Yeah.
-It's uncanny.

900
00:42:47,791 --> 00:42:49,666
-It's uncanny.
-They're very, very handsome.

901
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:52,416
-Have you ever...
-Yeah, that's crazy.

902
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,416
[chuckles]

903
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,708
Come, I show you party.

904
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:55,625
Come.

905
00:42:55,916 --> 00:42:57,708
-He doesn't notice...
-He doesn't understand.

906
00:42:57,791 --> 00:42:59,125
...that they all look like him.

907
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:04,708
So, there Lisa Lisa from Hungary.

908
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,958
Her odds not very good.
Not as bad as yours, but not good.

909
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:09,375
[all exclaim]

910
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:13,250
These The Wonderfour from Finland.

911
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:16,208
They have very hippy,
snappy rock and roll sound.

912
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:18,500
She is fabulous,
but she should ditch boys.

913
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:20,000
This Julia J.

914
00:43:20,083 --> 00:43:22,791
She come number one,
<i>England's Got Talent,</i> four years ago,

915
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:26,000
so she quite good,
but everybody hates UK, so...

916
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:27,416
zero points.

917
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:30,125
-Kevin.
-Kevin Swain.

918
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:31,916
I think you know my full name.

919
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:33,583
You shaved your cheek hair.

920
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:35,250
-Oh, so smooth.
-Oh, I miss it.

-You naughty boy.
-I know, I shouldn't have said that.

924
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:44,541
Oh, you look like a flashy disco ball.

925
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,708
-Kevin Swain. I know.
-Kevin Swain, visionary, the best.

-Do you like champagne?

[gasps] More tall glasses.

930
00:43:58,583 --> 00:43:59,750
-Okay.
-Love it.

931
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:04,625
Oh. Oh, my gosh. I almost forgot,
Mita Xenakis from Greece.

932
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:06,625
She one of the favorite.
She great pipes,

933
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:09,250
sing with a lot of emotion.
Mita, Mita!

934
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:11,833
Come, come. Come meet my Icelanders.

935
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:14,000
Baby, where have you been?

936
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,208
-Hello.
-Mita Xenakis, Lars Erickssong.

937
00:44:17,291 --> 00:44:19,208
-Hi.
-Sigrit Ericksdóttir.

938
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:20,750
Are you brother and sister?

939
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:23,250
-No.
-Probably not. Nah.

940
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:26,125
Sigrit have very beautiful voice.
Their song is quite good.

941
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:29,791
Yes, I agree. I think it is the best song
that I've ever written. I write our songs.

942
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:34,458
I also sing and design a lot of
the costumes and our footwear.

943
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:35,500
Fantastic.

944
00:44:35,583 --> 00:44:38,166
Why don't you tell me more
about your amazing talents over a drink.

945
00:44:38,291 --> 00:44:40,541
Come, Sigrit.
There's something I want to show you.

946
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:41,791
-Talk to me.
-Okay.

947
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:42,833
Are you good?

948
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:44,291
See you in a bit.

949
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:48,291
-Are you liking Eurovision so far? Good.
-Oh, yes. Very much so.

950
00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:50,208
I think we have a very good chance
of winning.

951
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:53,375
Oh, God. Win, lose, really doesn't matter.

952
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:55,125
Oh, where are we going?

953
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:58,208
-Please, let me show you.
-Okay.

00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,083
She must have left her key.

1111
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:29,500
-Mita.
-Hello.

1112
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:30,458
[grunts]

1113
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,666
-This is going to happen, Lars.
-Okay. My balls!

1114
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,958
-[Mita] Keep fighting. I like it.
-[Lars] I'm scared!

1115
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:38,625
[soft melody playing]

1116
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:55,125
Oh, good morning.

1117
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,791
Have you just been watching me?

1118
00:53:58,125 --> 00:53:59,083
No.

1119
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:00,375
I braid your hair.

1120
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:02,500
What?

1121
00:54:03,791 --> 00:54:05,750
I find it very relaxing pastime.

1122
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,458
Wow.

1123
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:13,250
That's quite good, actually.

1124
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,291
-Thank you very much.
-How long did that take you?

1125
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:16,500
Six hours.

1126
00:54:16,583 --> 00:54:17,500
[chuckles softly]

1127
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:25,583
[Sigrit] Um...

1128
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:26,666
Did anything...

1129
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,583
happen...

1130
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:30,291
kind of...

1131
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,083
Last night?

1132
00:54:33,416 --> 00:54:34,750
-Yeah.
-No, of course not.

1133
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:35,875
I gentleman.

1134
00:54:35,958 --> 00:54:36,916
Okay.

1135
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:39,375
[humming]

1136
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:41,250
Wait, what's it?

1137
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:43,000
How did you hear that?

1138
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,333
This song?

1139
00:54:44,416 --> 00:54:46,666
-Yes.
-You sing in your sleep.

1140
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:49,541
-It's very beautiful. You write this?
-Oh.

1141
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:51,000
Yeah.

1142
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:53,083
It's not finished yet.

1143
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,541
And when it is finished,
will you sing it with Lars?

1144
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:01,333
Probably not.

1145
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:03,083
Would you sing it with me?

1146
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,000
I can't. No.

1147
00:55:06,333 --> 00:55:09,083
Lars has been my partner since childhood.

1148
00:55:09,166 --> 00:55:10,958
Partner in music, but...

1149
00:55:11,916 --> 00:55:13,083
nothing else?

1150
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:19,291
Well, if we win the contest,
then I hope that might change.

1151
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:21,750
But if you don't win the contest,

1152
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:25,791
will Lars be content
if you are only one who adores him?

1153
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:29,375
You should not be stuck in his cage,
little bird.

1154
00:55:29,458 --> 00:55:33,375
You need to fly.
Sing your song, for the world.

1155
00:55:34,291 --> 00:55:35,125
Well...

1156
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:37,208
I am singing for the world.

1157
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:39,791
Thanks to Lars. I...

1158
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:43,083
So I should really probably go
and concentrate.

1159
00:55:43,166 --> 00:55:45,208
So I'm going to go, okay?

1160
00:55:45,791 --> 00:55:47,291
You don't have to fly alone.

1161
00:55:48,875 --> 00:55:51,250
I would like to travel the world with you.

1162
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:53,416
-What?
-Perform your song.

1163
00:55:53,666 --> 00:55:55,041
Record your song.

1164
00:55:55,458 --> 00:55:56,666
Sigrit-Lemtov...

1165
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:59,458
magazine cover,
shoot with you on sexy island,

1166
00:55:59,583 --> 00:56:01,708
make passionate music.

1167
00:56:02,291 --> 00:56:04,166
It would be very good deal for you.

1168
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:05,458
Um...

1169
00:56:05,791 --> 00:56:07,000
I have to go.

1170
00:56:07,458 --> 00:56:08,500
I'm gonna go.

1171
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:09,916
-I have to go.
-Just...

1172
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,000
-think about it.
-Okay.

1173
00:56:12,958 --> 00:56:15,708
Thank you for everything, Alexander.

1174
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Bye.

1175
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:22,958
Lars?

1176
00:56:26,958 --> 00:56:28,041
Are you awake?

1177
00:56:28,583 --> 00:56:31,166
I had the strangest night.

1178
00:56:32,458 --> 00:56:33,500
And I...

1179
00:56:34,041 --> 00:56:34,875
Hello.

1180
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:36,041
[gasps] Oh.

1181
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:38,833
Hey.

1182
00:56:39,875 --> 00:56:42,083
You, uh, remember, uh, Mita?

1183
00:56:43,791 --> 00:56:45,583
-[Mita chuckles]
-[Lars] Yes.

1184
00:56:50,916 --> 00:56:52,708
-Sigrit.
-[clicks tongue]

1185
00:56:53,791 --> 00:56:54,791
[moans softly]

1186
00:56:57,041 --> 00:56:58,083
[grunts]

1187
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,125
Oh, no.

1188
00:57:05,583 --> 00:57:07,458
Iceland, are we ready?

1189
00:57:07,541 --> 00:57:10,500
We are waiting on Sigrit!

1190
00:57:10,583 --> 00:57:11,416
Sir.

1191
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,625
[Sigrit] I am here!

1192
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:15,541
[sighs in relief]

1193
00:57:15,625 --> 00:57:18,208
-My king, your queen has arrived.
-Thank you, Kevin Swain.

1194
00:57:24,958 --> 00:57:26,125
What is this?

1195
00:57:26,208 --> 00:57:27,791
It is a costume I made.

1196
00:57:28,541 --> 00:57:29,833
Well, it's bad.

1197
00:57:29,916 --> 00:57:32,666
Well, maybe if you were more focused
and not out dancing all night,

1198
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:33,958
you might feel better about it.

1199
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,166
Oh!

1200
00:57:37,083 --> 00:57:39,250
-What are you doing?
-[fabric tearing]

1201
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,541
[fabric continues tearing]

1202
00:57:44,666 --> 00:57:45,958
You don't have to do this.

1203
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:52,791
Okay, and are we ready now?

1204
00:57:53,583 --> 00:57:54,416
Yup.

1205
00:57:55,791 --> 00:57:58,625
I have never been more ready!

1206
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,708
Okay, do you think I'm stupid?

1207
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,208
A guy like Lemtov,
all he wants from a girl like you...

1208
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:06,166
I didn't sleep with Lemtov!

1209
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:09,208
Oh, well, I didn't sleep with Mita.

1210
00:58:09,541 --> 00:58:13,625
Yeah, and I think I know
rotten shark meat when I smell it!

1211
00:58:13,708 --> 00:58:16,041
-Can't talk to you when you're like this.
-Know what, Lars?

1212
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:20,000
Why don't you just go ahead
and sleep with everyone?

1213
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:20,916
Eh?

1214
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
You know, hey, maybe I will, too.

1215
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:25,041
Because, you know, we're both free,

1216
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:27,708
so let's just go sex-nuts.

1217
00:58:27,791 --> 00:58:29,500
I am happy to go sex-nuts.

1218
00:58:29,583 --> 00:58:31,500
I am going to have sex with everyone!

1219
00:58:31,583 --> 00:58:32,583
-Great.
-Yes.

1220
00:58:32,666 --> 00:58:35,875
Starting with that lady,
emptying the garbage can.

1221
00:58:35,958 --> 00:58:36,875
Yes.

1222
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:37,833
Hmm.

1223
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:39,291
And Kevin Swain. Easy.

1224
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:41,333
Lovely. Thank you.

1225
00:58:41,666 --> 00:58:43,000
Nina, what do you say?

1226
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:45,458
Okay, Nina is out.

1227
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:47,250
And that guy over there.

1228
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:49,416
Yes, holding the iPad
or whatever that is...

1229
00:58:49,541 --> 00:58:51,333
I can't read what it says
on your name tag.

1230
00:58:51,791 --> 00:58:53,458
-Theo!
-Theo!

1231
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:55,791
I'm going to have sex with you, my friend.

1232
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:57,416
I'm going to be all over you.

1233
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,458
It's going to be passionate and white-hot.

1234
00:58:59,541 --> 00:59:01,541
You're going to melt under my body heat.

1235
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:03,625
So listen up, everyone, there is a new...

1236
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:07,333
sex machine in town, and his name is Lars.

1237
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,250
Go tell that to your Russian friend.

1238
00:59:09,625 --> 00:59:11,750
Yeah, well, at least he sees me.

1239
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:13,833
I see you every day!

1240
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:16,416
No, you don't.

1241
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,250
And I don't like this version of the song.

1242
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:23,291
And I want to go back to the way it was.

1243
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:25,875
Got me?

1244
00:59:26,458 --> 00:59:27,375
Where are you going?

1245
00:59:27,791 --> 00:59:30,291
You have to focus up.
The semifinals are tomorrow.

1246
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:32,208
-And you're blowing it big time.
-No.

1247
00:59:32,791 --> 00:59:34,333
You are blowing it big time.

1248
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:37,458
You're small, Lars Erickssong.

1249
00:59:39,541 --> 00:59:40,583
So small.

1250
00:59:45,083 --> 00:59:47,791
And Iceland, your time is up.
Please clear the stage.

1251
00:59:49,708 --> 00:59:50,666
[sighs]

1252
01:00:00,458 --> 01:00:01,291
Look at you.

1253
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,916
You are an ugly loser.

1254
01:00:06,166 --> 01:00:08,083
Sigrit was right. You are small.

1255
01:00:10,291 --> 01:00:11,541
You need to grow up.

1256
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:12,958
I know.

1257
01:00:14,208 --> 01:00:17,458
Why did you say you would have sex with
all those people? That was ridiculous.

1258
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:18,875
Come on, you embarrassed yourself.

1259
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:20,041
Mm-hmm.

1260
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:22,083
Do you think you'd have a chance
with Theo?

1261
01:00:22,166 --> 01:00:24,375
-Never.
-Never. Not in a million lifetimes.

1262
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:26,000
Eh, duh!

1263
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,791
Dude. Yo, dude.

1264
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:30,083
Dude.

1265
01:00:30,166 --> 01:00:33,416
Hey, dude, uh, do you know if this is
where they shot G.O.T.?

1266
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,708
-Huh?
<i>-Game of Thrones.</i>

1267
01:00:37,208 --> 01:00:39,791
Give me a break, man. Can't you see
I was talking to my reflection?

1268
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:41,041
Chill out, bro.

1269
01:00:41,125 --> 01:00:42,333
You chill out, bro.

1270
01:00:42,416 --> 01:00:45,875
Why do you Americans always say
"chill out" like that to everyone?

1271
01:00:45,958 --> 01:00:47,375
Jeff, let's go. The guy's nuts.

I'm taking this rope that's loose

went into the audience.

You... didn't quit.

of your mother.

I left Sigrit all alone.
And now, she doesn't want me anymore.

she never liked me.

1828

Never wanted anything to do with me.

that you have to fight for her.

You have to fight for her like you fought
for that stupid song contest.

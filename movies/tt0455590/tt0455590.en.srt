00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,635
<i>- Come on! Are youse ready?
- Aye! Aye!</i>

3
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:55,305
<i>On your marks!
Get set!</i>

4
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,850
Go!

5
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,369
Yeah!

6
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,503
Stew, Dr. Garrigan?

7
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:32,509
- And you, Dr. Garrigan?
- Hmm.

8
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,511
I, uh-

9
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,722
- I thought that-
- Mother.

10
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:40,934
<i>Seeing as we have something to celebrate,
we might have a wee drop.</i>

11
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,270
- Sherry.
- Right. Right.

12
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:47,024
Uh-huh. Your mother and I
are very proud of you, Nicholas.

13
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:51,195
- Very proud.
- Not quite as good a degree as mine...

14
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,364
but a fine one
nevertheless.

15
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:59,369
Being a family doctor-

16
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,039
Well, let me tell you, Nicholas,
you've chosen a fine life.

17
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:07,044
If you'll both raise your glasses...

18
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,046
a toast.

19
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,089
To father and son.

20
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,387
A long future together.

21
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,078
<i>Nicholas, are you all right in there?</i>

22
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,121
I'm fine.

23
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm fine.

24
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:51,421
Okay. First place you land,
you go.

25
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:55,092
First place you land,
you go.

26
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,806
Canada.

27
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:10,000
<i>What are all the soldiers for?</i>

28
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,252
- Excuse me. Do you speak English?
- Yes.

29
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,630
What are all the soldiers for?

30
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,549
<i>The army's taking over.
There is a coup.</i>

31
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,552
<i>- A coup? What, are we safe?
- Don't worry.</i>

32
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:23,889
<i>These are General Amin's men.
He fights for the people.</i>

33
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,517
It's a very happy day
for us.

34
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,118
- Is that him?
- Yes.

35
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:48,121
<i>- What do you do in Scotland?
- Well, I'm a doctor.</i>

36
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,499
- A qualified doctor.
- Oh.

37
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:54,044
Yeah. I thought maybe
use my skills here, you know?

38
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,716
<i>Monkeys! Look! Look up there, Tolu. Look.</i>

39
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,010
Do you have monkeys
in Scotland?

40
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,596
No, we don't have monkeys in Scotland.

41
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,391
<i>No. If we had monkeys
in Scotland...</i>

42
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,560
<i>we'd probably
deep-fry them.</i>

43
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,361
I think
I'm gonna like it.

44
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,502
This is my stop.

45
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,094
I'm a medical officer
overseas!

46
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,294
<i>Dr. Garrigan?</i>

47
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:21,298
- Uh, Dr. Merrit.
- No, I'm Sarah, David's wife.

48
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,176
- Welcome.
- Hello.

49
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,345
David was called out
on an emergency.

50
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,598
- I hope everything's okay.
- Yeah. Just normal business around here.

51
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,683
Safe journey?

52
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,478
- Uh, well, you know, it was-
- Bloody awful.

53
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,356
Goat up your ass and your face
in someone's armpit.

54
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,108
Last time I did that trip,
I nearly asphyxiated.

55
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,737
Right. Hop in.

56
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,247
<i>Actually, I waited
for the bus yesterday too.</i>

57
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:56,375
- Oh, yeah?
- We were getting a little worried about you.

58
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,710
Thought you might have
got caught up in the coup.

59
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:06,552
It's official now, by the way.
Obote's out. Radio's full of it.

60
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:09,096
Who's Obote?

61
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:13,141
- Ex-president.
- Oh, right. And, uh, what's his name.

62
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,310
<i>Amin. He's taken over.
Yeah?</i>

63
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:17,855
<i>You've certainly come
at a busy time.</i>

64
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,691
Whatever I can do
to help.

65
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,597
<i>- Morning, Nicholas.
- Morning.</i>

66
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,391
- So, what do you think?
- Aye. Aye, fine.

67
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,185
Come on. Come through.

68
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,061
This is
the operating room.

69
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,190
Simple procedures
for the most part.

70
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,901
- Ah, morning.
- Morning.

71
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:08,822
<i>If you don't mind me asking,
how many doctors are there here?</i>

72
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:12,075
Well, there's me, and, uh-
and now there's you.

73
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,411
<i>- Good morning, Sister. Good morning.
- Morning.</i>

74
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,081
You know, the, uh,
interesting thing is...

75
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:21,168
80% of the locals still prefer
the witch doctor to us.

76
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:26,423
Sometimes I think we're just...
skimming the surface of an ocean.

77
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,220
- Ready?
- Yeah.

78
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:34,056
There we are.
Whoo.

79
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,267
- There we go. Okay.
- Over here. Okay.

80
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,313
Yes, thank you.

81
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,190
And-

82
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:46,109
<i>Okay, and one more. Okay, who's next?</i>

83
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,154
That's a lovely name.
Can I just see your-

84
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:01,458
Yeah?

85
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,468
Nicholas, are you ready?

86
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,471
Dr. Merrit.

87
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,144
What is it?

88
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:05,564
- Complications with the Magisha baby.
- I'll go.

89
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,942
No, no. I'd better go.
I know the mother.

90
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:13,197
Ah, sorry. I'll be back
in an hour or two.

91
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,451
<i>Bonny.</i>

92
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,453
<i>Jump in.</i>

93
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,455
- Hi, Bonny.
- Hi.

94
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,213
Mmm.

95
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,554
- I hope you don't mind me saying this, but-
- Yeah?

96
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,350
You seem an unlikely candidate
for this kind of work.

97
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,646
Why? 'Cause I don't wear
socks and sandals?

98
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:47,648
Touchi.

99
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:50,901
I still want to make
a difference, you know.

100
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:53,362
- Really?
- Yes, really.

101
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,447
Want to have fun, too, though.

102
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,866
Bit of adventure.
Something different.

103
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,994
That's a lot of things.

104
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,996
Is it?

105
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,977
Yeah!

106
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:31,441
It's a beautiful goal
for Scotland!

107
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,402
Yeah!

108
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,446
That's a good one.

109
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,949
Hey, Bonny, why are the women singing?

110
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,077
<i>You don't know?
The president is coming to the village.</i>

111
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,789
Where's Dr. Merrit?

112
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:49,626
- He has gone to town for stores.
- Right.

113
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,380
Come on. I thought you might be
slightly curious to see the new boss.

114
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:56,258
I don't work for Amin.

115
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,344
Right. Fine.

116
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:02,389
Just thought
it might be... fun.

117
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:07,644
Okay.

118
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,814
Okay, okay.

119
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,790
Amin!

120
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:32,419
Amin! Amin!

121
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,005
Amin! Amin!

122
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:54,858
<i>Amin! Amin!</i>

123
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:22,302
And I want to promise you...

124
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:27,182
this will be a government
of action, not of words.

125
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:36,191
We will build new schools,
new roads!

126
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,279
And new houses!

127
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:45,117
<i>I may wear...</i>

128
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,620
the uniform...
of a general...

129
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:53,083
but, hey-

130
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,628
In my heart,
I am a simple man.

131
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,840
Like you.

132
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:03,385
I know who you are
and everything that you are.

133
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,055
I am you.

134
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:11,602
Ask my soldiers.
All my life...

135
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:16,440
I never eat food
until my soldiers have eaten first.

136
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:23,071
It will be like this
in Uganda now.

137
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:27,534
Together, we will
make this country better.

138
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,081
And stronger!

139
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,211
And free!

140
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,880
Whoo! Whoo!

141
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:54,186
<i>- Have you seen enough now?
- What?</i>

142
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,271
Have you seen
enough now?

143
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:58,815
<i>Just- Just a couple
of minutes.</i>

144
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,194
Whoo!

145
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:05,364
Whoo.

146
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:12,204
<i>- Can we please go now?
- Okay.</i>

147
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:29,847
They sang just like that
for Obote...

148
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:33,517
until they realized that he turned
their economy into a personal bank account.

149
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,769
Oh, come on. Give the man a chance.

150
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:39,106
I'm serious.
You talk to me in a couple of years.

151
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:46,196
What's going on?

152
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,411
Jesus.

153
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,166
What's the problem?

154
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,712
They're looking for a doctor.

155
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:03,797
The president's been hurt
in an accident.

156
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,883
We have to come. We'll follow you?

157
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,969
God. How terrifying.

158
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:23,901
My hand!

159
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:27,946
- Whoa. Whoa.
- My hand is broken!

160
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:32,743
Get that farmer out of my sight!

161
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,958
Hey. Hey.

162
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:44,338
Come. Come here.

163
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:49,468
My name's Dr. Garrigan.
I hear you have a problem with your hand.

164
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:53,222
I'd like to examine it. Hmm?

165
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:58,435
There you go.
Okay, now do a fork.

166
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,688
Raise your thumb like that.

167
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:04,942
<i>Okay. How's that?</i>

168
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:07,694
Sarah, I think we're gonna
need a splint here.

169
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,947
Please, can somebody do something
about that bloody cow?

170
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:12,491
I don't think you've broken it.
I think it's just sprained.

171
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:15,619
Please! It's in pain!

172
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:31,385
Can you just hold that now with your other hand?

173
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,304
Sarah, can you go and talk
to that farmer about his cow, please?

174
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,322
Sarah, how's it goin'?

175
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,415
Will somebody please
put that animal out of its misery!

176
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,792
<i>I'm trying
to explain to them!</i>

177
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:06,378
For God's sake!

178
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,068
I'm sorry. I-

179
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,824
<i>- I couldn't hear myself think.
- You took my gun.</i>

180
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:37,951
- Yeah.
- Who are you?

181
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,245
<i>Nicholas-
I'm Dr. Nicholas Garrigan.</i>

182
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,706
I work at the medical compound in Mgambo.
I'm a doctor.

183
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,708
<i>You are British.</i>

184
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,336
Brit- Uh, well-
I'm Scottish.

185
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,505
I'm Scottish.

186
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:51,882
- Scottish?
- Yeah.

187
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:55,552
Why didn't you say so?
I fought with the Scots against the Mau Mau.

188
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:57,554
Great soldiers.
Very brave.

189
00:18:57,638 --> 00:18:59,598
And good people.
Completely.

190
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:03,685
Let me tell you, if I could be anything
instead of a Ugandan...

191
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:05,771
- I would be a Scot, my friend.
- Right. Really?

192
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,899
Except for the- the red hair...

193
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:12,236
which I'm sure is attractive
to your women...

194
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:14,530
but which we Africans-
We find this quite disgusting.

195
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:21,078
Thank you, Dr. Garrigan.
A very good job.

196
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:26,083
Hey, please.

197
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,168
Would you let me
have this T-shirt?

198
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:31,505
My son, Campbell,
he would love this T-shirt.

199
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,259
- You've got a son called Campbell?
- Yeah.

200
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,970
Maybe you would take my-
my shirt here in exchange.

201
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:42,432
Right. Of course.
Yeah.

202
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:50,899
- Ah.
- Thank you.

203
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:55,571
Aha. You see?
Now you are a general, like me.

204
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:58,991
- Salute, please.
- Oh.

205
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:00,784
Now I must leave.

206
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:28,770
<i>And I bet you
that's worth a few bob.</i>

207
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:30,856
Yeah.

208
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:35,652
Hmm.

209
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:38,697
I still can't believe
how you shot that cow.

210
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:41,783
You're mad.

211
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:46,914
Um, anyway,
I think I have to go.

212
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,667
- Do you fancy a wee drink on the porch?
- No, thank you.

213
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:53,504
<i>I'm okay. Really.
I- Nicholas.</i>

214
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:56,465
I have to go. No.

215
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:58,467
Look, it's fine,
all right?

216
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,094
We're just havin' a drink.

217
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:10,103
Oh, God.

218
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:13,023
- I can't do this.
- What?

219
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,528
My husband
is a good man.

220
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:20,280
Oh, Christ.
I sound ridiculous.

221
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:25,035
I guess I-

222
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,412
I guess I just need you
to understand why I'm here.

223
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:29,706
- It's okay. I do understand.
- No, you don't.

224
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:35,045
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

225
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,798
It's just, sometimes...

226
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:40,717
when you're married
to such a very good man...

227
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:45,931
it's-

228
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:49,017
- It-It makes you feel-
- Like shit.

229
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:53,772
My father's the same.

230
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,735
And...

231
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:00,821
it's nice to be noticed.

232
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:07,744
- Mmm. No, I can't. I can't. I can't.
- Sarah.

233
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:10,080
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

234
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,667
- No, I don't-
- Sarah, it's fine.

235
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:15,669
Don't, please.
Please.

236
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,780
<i>Nicholas.</i>

237
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:49,369
Nicholas, there are some people here to see you.

238
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:53,040
Be, um,
right there, David.

239
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:55,042
Right. Right.

240
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:01,924
- Good morning, Dr. Garrigan.
- Morning.

241
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:04,301
My name is Jonah Wasswa,
Minister of Health here in Uganda.

242
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:07,638
<i>I've been sent by His Excellency,
President Amin.</i>

243
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:11,308
- There is something he would like
to ask you in person. - Wh-What?

244
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,852
<i>Sarah?</i>

245
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:15,854
Oh, hey. Listen.

246
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:18,649
Why don't you tell David
to rearrange the field trip for Friday?

247
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:20,984
All right? I'll be back
as soon as I can.

248
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:24,655
He probably just wants me to retie his bandages.
Okay, I'll see you later.

249
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:36,333
My name is Masanga.

250
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,961
Nice to meet you.
I'm Nicholas.

251
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:41,797
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Nicholas.

252
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,341
Welcome
to the president's car.

253
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:52,182
<i>- They think you are the president.
- Eh?</i>

254
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:56,353
They think you are the president.

255
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,625
The president's house.

256
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:07,090
Please sit down.

257
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:09,259
His Excellency
will be with you in a moment.

258
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:13,931
- And who's this?
- Oh. Dr. Junju, the previous incumbent.

259
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:17,267
<i>- Of what?
- Of the post...</i>

260
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:19,937
of personal physician to the president.

261
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,773
Hold on to your guns!

262
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:25,067
Everyone!
Hold on to your guns!

263
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:30,781
- Good to see you again, Dr. Garrigan.
- You too.

264
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:35,118
You see, Jonah? This is the sort of man
a president needs around him-

265
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:37,871
someone who is not afraid
to speak his mind.

266
00:25:39,665 --> 00:25:41,875
So, what do you say,
Nicholas?

267
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,753
Will you take the job?

268
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:46,755
Wha- I'm sorry.
Um-

269
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:50,342
- You want me to be your physician?
- Mmm.

270
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:55,347
- Do you want to be of service to Uganda, Dr. Garrigan?
- Yes, I do.

271
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,516
Then what better way...

272
00:25:57,641 --> 00:26:00,519
than to look after the health
of its president?

273
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:04,147
And let me tell you,
it will not be a difficult job.

274
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:07,401
Because me, myself,
I am a man...

275
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:10,404
in perfect physical condition.

276
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:15,033
Also, I know precisely
when I will die.

277
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:18,287
It came to me in a dream.

278
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,956
So, you do not have to worry
about making a mistake.

279
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:27,546
- I'm really sorry. I'm-I'm very honored, but-
- Nicholas.

280
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:30,048
I understand.

281
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:33,260
Me, myself, I did not
want to be president.

282
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:35,345
But the people,
they wanted it so.

283
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:40,934
Listen to me.
This is very important.

284
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:43,437
Here, in Kampala...

285
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:45,522
you will have a hand
in creating...

286
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:48,358
a new health service
for this country-

287
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:51,778
something that will help
millions of people.

288
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:57,993
I'm sorry. I really do have a commitment
to the mission in Mgambo.

289
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:00,662
I'd be lettin' them down
horribly. You see?

290
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:10,631
Ah.

291
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:13,509
It's the woman,
the one I saw you with.

292
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:15,594
You want to get back
to be with her.

293
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:18,597
Well, not entirely.

294
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,600
It's the woman.
It's the woman.

295
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:24,895
Why don't you tell her
to come and be here with us?

296
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:27,397
Uh, well, it's not
that simple.

297
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:29,566
- It's quite complicated actually.
- Why?

298
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:34,321
- Is she married?
- Yes, she is.

299
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:39,660
Ah, Doctor.

300
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:42,829
Doctor, you-
you are very naughty.

301
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:46,166
Me?

302
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:49,378
Ah, now you are
even more interesting.

303
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:54,383
Married women, they are always
the most passionate, huh?

304
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:56,468
Yes.

305
00:27:56,552 --> 00:27:58,512
- It's true.
- They are so grateful, huh?

306
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:05,227
Hmm. Yes.

307
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:09,606
I'm sorry. Yes, I'm sorry
for wasting your time.

308
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,608
No, no.

309
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:15,279
My car will take you back
first thing in the morning.

310
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:20,742
But, in the meantime-
Tonight, we are having a state dinner.

311
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:22,870
Please, would you
join us there?

312
00:28:22,995 --> 00:28:24,955
I'd very much like that.
Thank you.

313
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:28,208
You have a suit?
Dark suit?

314
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,919
- No. No, I don't.
- Hmm.

315
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:46,101
How much is this gonna
cost me, by the way?

316
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:48,103
It's okay.
It's the president's account.

317
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:54,151
<i>- Oh, can I just-
- Hey! Stop!</i>

318
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:05,662
<i>- What's goin' on?
- Obote's men.</i>

319
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:09,082
- They're everywhere.
- Really?

320
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:12,669
Yep. They're communists,
you know?

321
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:15,797
Mind you, Amin's
more than a match for them.

322
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:18,675
He's ex-British army-
King's African Rifles.

323
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,719
- Uh, Jamshid.
- Yes, sir?

324
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:24,306
Pack those up and have them sent to the
High Commission in the morning, please. Thanks.

325
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:26,391
<i>Yes, he's a little
unpredictable...</i>

326
00:29:26,475 --> 00:29:29,394
but he's got
a firm hand.

327
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,939
Only thing the African really understands.

328
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:34,900
<i>- Thanks, Jamshid.
- You're welcome.</i>

329
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:43,033
Yeah, up yours too, pal.
Bloody English.

330
00:30:05,848 --> 00:30:08,892
Hello.

331
00:30:13,272 --> 00:30:15,190
Hello.

332
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:22,114
Hello there.
How do you do?

333
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:24,616
- Ah! Nicholas.
- Oh!

334
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:26,702
- I'm so happy you came.
- So am I.

335
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:30,205
Please. Please, this way.
I want to introduce you to my wives.

336
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:33,083
Excuse me. Here.
This is Malyamu.

337
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:35,419
She is my first wife.
She has given me five children.

338
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:37,713
Hello.

339
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:40,674
<i>And this one- Nora.
She has given me three.</i>

340
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,801
Hello.

341
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:46,013
And that here
is Kay. Yes.

342
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:48,765
<i>- This is Dr. Nicholas Garrigan.
- Hello.</i>

343
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:51,935
- He saved my life.
- Oh, wel- Really, I just stitched his hand up.

344
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,271
<i>- It was-
- Don't be so modest.</i>

345
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:56,940
I believe it is you
I have to thank for the T-shirt.

346
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,235
Oh, right.
So you must be Campbell's mother.

347
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:03,238
- Yes.
- It's a pleasure meeting you.

348
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:06,074
Please come. I have to introduce you
to some people here.

349
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:10,412
Excuse me.

350
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:14,791
- This is, uh, British High Commissioner, Mr. Perkins.
- How do you do?

351
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:18,253
Please, meet my good friend
Dr. Nicholas Garrigan.

352
00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:20,214
<i>And his colleague
Mr. Stone.</i>

353
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:23,050
- How do you do?
- Fine. Yes, we've already met.

354
00:31:23,175 --> 00:31:26,136
- Well, I will talk with you later.
- Oh, right.

355
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:30,432
So, uh, Dr. Garrigan, we've been hearing
all sorts of things about you.

356
00:31:30,516 --> 00:31:34,144
Yes, I, uh- I gather the president
has clasped you to his bosom.

357
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:36,522
Uh, no, no.
Not exactly.

358
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:38,649
What do you
make of him?

359
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:40,651
Well, I think he's doing
rather a great job.

360
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:44,071
- Don't you?
- Yes. He has some issues to be sorted out.

361
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:46,281
But, no, he plays
a pretty straight bat.

362
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:49,284
- Yes, definitely one of us.
- Anyway...

363
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:52,204
it's very good to, uh,
have another Englishman around.

364
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:53,997
- Scot.
- What?

365
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:58,168
I'm a Scotsman.

366
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,674
Ladies and gentlemen,
friends.

367
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:07,302
<i>I am speaking with you now
because if I wait until later...</i>

368
00:32:07,386 --> 00:32:09,847
you will be too drunk
to hear my voice.

369
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:17,020
<i>- Here is where civilization began.
- Yes.</i>

370
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:19,106
Here in Africa.

371
00:32:19,231 --> 00:32:24,069
<i>Here is where the Greeks
stole their philosophy...</i>

372
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:27,573
and the Arabs took
their medicine.

373
00:32:27,656 --> 00:32:32,327
We Ugandans must be more proud
of this history.

374
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:36,331
<i>We are an independent
African nation...</i>

375
00:32:36,415 --> 00:32:40,544
<i>living in peace
and economic power.</i>

376
00:32:42,004 --> 00:32:45,340
- Black power.
- Yes.

377
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:49,261
Just like all you people
thought would never be possible.

378
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:54,725
<i>And now we will go through
to dinner.</i>

379
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:58,395
The food tonight,
it is all local...

380
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,939
special food.

381
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:03,358
And none of it
is human flesh.

382
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:07,988
This is my last.

383
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:22,252
Dr. Garrigan. Please come quickly.
The president is very sick.

384
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:25,339
They have poisoned me.

385
00:33:25,464 --> 00:33:28,175
They are trying
to assassinate me.

386
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,094
- Nicholas.
- Okay.

387
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:33,639
I just have to examine
your stomach.

388
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:39,019
<i>Obote's people are everywhere.
They want me dead, Nicholas.</i>

389
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:42,439
Okay, I'm just-
I need to do this. Okay?

390
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:44,983
One more. One more.

391
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:47,402
Okay. Okay.

392
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:50,113
Okay.

393
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:56,453
Okay. I think I know what this is.
Let me listen, just listen.

394
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:04,086
Okay. Yeah, okay.
I think I know what this is.

395
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:08,674
Bear with me. Uh-

396
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:13,095
There we go.

397
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:19,226
There we are.
Okay.

398
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:21,728
I'm gonna ask you
to sit on this pouf right here.

399
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:29,486
- Hey! What is this?
- It's okay. It's okay.

400
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:32,155
- What is this?
- It's okay. I'm just gonna hold it against your stomach.

401
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:34,491
<i>I'm gonna ask you to stand up...
in three.</i>

402
00:34:34,575 --> 00:34:38,161
One, two, three. Go.

403
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,518
I feel better,
much better.

404
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:05,689
<i>Ah. Ah, yes.</i>

405
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:08,859
You are a good doctor.
Thank you.

406
00:35:08,984 --> 00:35:12,696
In future, remember
not to mix beer with aspirin.

407
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,036
- That was the cause?
- I think so, yes.

408
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,207
I am ashamed
that you saw me like that.

409
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:27,503
- I was frightened.
- I'm a doctor.

410
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:30,380
Everything that passes between us
is confidential.

411
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:33,050
Okay? I've taken an oath.

412
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:38,347
But a man who shows fear,
he is weak...

413
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:41,183
and he is a slave.

414
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:44,144
Well, if you're afraid
of dying...

415
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:46,230
it shows you have
a life worth keeping.

416
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,359
Ah.

417
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:53,946
You see?

418
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:58,075
You are a doctor...
and also a philosopher.

419
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,161
Yes.

420
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:04,248
I do have
a good life now.

421
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:06,792
Please.
Please, sit.

422
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,794
Sit here.
Sit here.

423
00:36:13,382 --> 00:36:17,094
I come from...
a very poor family.

424
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:19,221
I think
you should know this.

425
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:21,390
My father, he left me
when I was a child.

426
00:36:21,473 --> 00:36:24,852
The British army,
it became my home.

427
00:36:24,977 --> 00:36:28,814
They took me as a...

428
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:33,193
cleaner in the kitchen,
cleaning pots.

429
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:35,279
They used to beat me.

430
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:40,242
"Build this wall, Amin. "

431
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:42,953
"Dig this latrine, Amin. "

432
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:47,249
And now here I am,
the president of Uganda.

433
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:51,086
And who put me here?
Huh?

434
00:36:53,964 --> 00:36:57,217
It was the British.

435
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:01,430
What a story.

436
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:06,768
- Good night, Nicholas.
- Good night, sir.

437
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:24,995
<i>Uh, hello. Sarah, it's Nicholas.</i>

438
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,332
<i>- Nicholas, where are you?
- I'm still in Kampala actually.</i>

439
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:30,125
Thank you.

440
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:33,337
<i>Look, the president's
offered me a job here.</i>

441
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:35,422
<i>Normally, I wouldn't even
bother considering it.</i>

442
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:39,801
<i>- But, under the circumstances...
- Thank you.</i>

443
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:42,596
<i>I thought it might
be quite a good idea.</i>

444
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:46,975
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

445
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:49,311
David will be disappointed.

446
00:37:49,394 --> 00:37:52,814
Oh, well, I'll write to David.
Of course I will.

447
00:37:52,898 --> 00:37:54,816
Of course.

448
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,028
I just hope you can do as much good there
as you could've done here.

449
00:37:58,153 --> 00:38:00,489
Look, somebody's
callin' me.

450
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:03,784
I'd, uh, better go.

451
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:07,371
- Sure.
- All right. Well, listen. Bye, Sarah.

452
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:10,707
- I'll be in touch.
- Bye.

453
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:30,269
<i>When you're not treating
the president or his family...</i>

454
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:33,564
the hospital could use
your expertise here.

455
00:38:37,776 --> 00:38:41,655
<i>This is one
of our new medical wards.</i>

456
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:47,911
Farther down the corridor
will be the operating theaters...

457
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:49,955
which the president
has paid for himself.

458
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,749
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Hi, Doctor.</i>

459
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:56,587
- Welcome to Mulago, Dr. -
- Garrigan. Hello.

460
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:00,966
I do hope you find the hospital
up to the standard you are used to.

461
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:07,931
Uh, excuse me.
Who was that?

462
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:11,393
Your predecessor-
Dr. Junju.

463
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:15,105
<i>- Never mind him.
- Excuse me, sir. Two men to see you.</i>

464
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:18,275
- Excuse me a moment.
- Of course.

465
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:24,948
- Hello. Jolly nice of you.
- It's very nice.

466
00:39:31,997 --> 00:39:35,083
<i>Dr. Garrigan.</i>

467
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:38,170
Just topping up on quinine.

468
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:40,172
So, you've decided to stay.

469
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:42,382
- Uh, yes. Yes, I did.
- Excellent. Excellent.

470
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:44,468
Well, listen,
I just wanted to say...

471
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:47,513
that if there's anything
we can possibly help you with...

472
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:49,640
please don't, um,
hesitate.

473
00:39:49,765 --> 00:39:52,434
What, you're my new best friend now?

474
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,065
Do just stay in touch.

475
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,400
Why?

476
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:02,819
Well, given
that we were so, uh...

477
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:09,243
<i>intimately involved
with the president coming to... power...</i>

478
00:40:09,368 --> 00:40:13,288
the Foreign Office has asked me
to point out our awareness...

479
00:40:13,372 --> 00:40:17,835
of your very unique personal relationship
with President Amin.

480
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,878
Mm-hmm?

481
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:24,508
Should you find the need to clarify your status...

482
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:27,261
regarding the details
of that relationship...

483
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:29,513
we would of course welcome
any clarification you might...

484
00:40:29,638 --> 00:40:33,308
feel the need to share with us.

485
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:39,690
Is there some special school
where you people...

486
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:42,109
learn to talk
that bollocks?

487
00:40:45,112 --> 00:40:49,199
Do, please, stay in touch.

488
00:40:49,324 --> 00:40:51,451
You-You take care now.

489
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:02,254
This man is going to kill-
He's going to kill the president.

490
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:05,215
So Nicholas walks up to that cow,
and he shoots it in the head.

491
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:09,887
On your marks!

492
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:12,598
Get set!

493
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:14,766
Go!

494
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:18,228
Amin! Amin!

495
00:41:21,982 --> 00:41:24,568
- Ho!
- I won.

496
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:37,414
Hit my hand. Yes.

497
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:40,459
- Okay. Nicholas.
- Oh, no, no, no.

498
00:41:45,506 --> 00:41:48,967
Before I forget,
I need to ask a favor.

499
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:50,969
Anything.

500
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:53,013
I will be in Libya
next week...

501
00:41:53,138 --> 00:41:55,349
and I need you to attend
a meeting in my place.

502
00:41:55,474 --> 00:42:00,562
- What kind of meeting?
- A simple matter of taste and common sense.

503
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:04,816
I cannot think of anyone
better than you.

504
00:42:17,663 --> 00:42:20,707
Ah, gentlemen, please.
Don't get up.

505
00:42:20,832 --> 00:42:22,876
<i>The president
sends his apologies.</i>

506
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:25,963
He's been called away-
on short notice.

507
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:28,590
He's asked me to step in.

508
00:42:28,674 --> 00:42:32,553
- And you are?
- Nicholas Garrigan, his doctor.

509
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:36,473
<i>- His doctor?
- Yes.</i>

510
00:42:36,557 --> 00:42:41,103
- And you are?
- I'm the Austrian foreign minister.

511
00:42:41,186 --> 00:42:43,981
This is Dr. Ramml,
one of our leading architects...

512
00:42:44,106 --> 00:42:47,609
and Dr. Brunner
from the Institute of Civil Engineering.

513
00:42:47,693 --> 00:42:49,736
Together,
we are the first bid.

514
00:42:49,862 --> 00:42:52,906
Bid, right.

515
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:55,450
For what precisely?

516
00:43:04,877 --> 00:43:07,337
I love it.

517
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:09,381
Good choice.

518
00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:13,385
Modern, elegant-
a symbol of Uganda's future.

519
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:17,973
<i>- Here is where we will have the
next Pan-African Congress. - Nice.</i>

520
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:22,019
My two closest advisors-

521
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:25,022
Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

522
00:43:26,982 --> 00:43:30,527
- Look what Nicholas has designed for me.
- Nice.

523
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:33,155
- I didn't design anything. It was more-
- That's nonsense.

524
00:43:33,238 --> 00:43:35,908
You have a wonderful eye.

525
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:38,702
Jonah- he has...
no taste.

526
00:43:38,827 --> 00:43:41,288
<i>Look at him.</i>

527
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:44,249
Even his suits,
they look silly.

528
00:43:44,374 --> 00:43:47,628
Is that not right, Jonah?

529
00:43:55,761 --> 00:43:57,721
What is it you want, Jonah?

530
00:43:57,804 --> 00:44:00,557
I have some ministerial papers
for your signature.

531
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:02,809
Go.

532
00:44:02,935 --> 00:44:06,188
I will sign them later.

533
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:16,573
I do not like the way
that man looks at me.

534
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:20,786
Do you think
he looks at me strangely?

535
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:23,580
No. No, I can't say
that I've noticed.

536
00:44:25,165 --> 00:44:27,417
Okay. Enlargement
of the medial sternum...

537
00:44:27,543 --> 00:44:30,379
and reticular nodular
lung patterns-

538
00:44:30,462 --> 00:44:32,214
<i>all indicating
pulmonary T.B.</i>

539
00:44:32,297 --> 00:44:35,342
Yeah, but it could be disseminated-

540
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,013
What was that?

541
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:00,450
Makindye Prison-
where Obote's people are being held.

542
00:45:00,576 --> 00:45:03,787
Can you hear that?

543
00:45:05,873 --> 00:45:08,333
<i>Dr. Garrigan! Dr. Garrigan!</i>

544
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:10,419
Please! Come quickly.

545
00:45:10,502 --> 00:45:13,463
<i>The president's son
is sick.</i>

546
00:45:13,547 --> 00:45:16,425
What's wrong with him? What's wrong with him?

547
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:26,894
<i>Can you hear me, child?
I'm begging you to stop it. Mackenzie!</i>

548
00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:29,271
- Thank you. You can step away.
- Stop it, Mackenzie. Please.

549
00:45:29,354 --> 00:45:33,400
- Thank you. Your son's epileptic?
- I don't know.

550
00:45:33,525 --> 00:45:35,777
- What? Has he been like this before?
- Yes.

551
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:38,655
Right. Can you hold his knees
up against his chest?

552
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:41,408
- Yeah, yeah.
- If you can do that. Okay. The other hand back here.

553
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:43,994
<i>- This is Campbell?
- It's Mackenzie, Campbell's brother.</i>

554
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:46,538
- Mackenzie? Right.
- Come on, Mackenzie. Come on, baby.

555
00:45:46,622 --> 00:45:49,833
Mackenzie,
I am Dr. Garrigan. Okay?

556
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:51,960
<i>We're gonna
sort you out.</i>

557
00:45:52,044 --> 00:45:54,046
- We'll get you to hospital. It's gonna be fine.
- No, no, no.

558
00:45:54,129 --> 00:45:56,215
- The president will not allow it.
- I really think the child-

559
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:59,009
- You must do what you can do from here.
- The child has to go to hospital.

560
00:45:59,092 --> 00:46:01,970
Please! Please.

561
00:46:04,598 --> 00:46:06,642
It's okay now, baby.
Mama's here.

562
00:46:06,725 --> 00:46:11,021
Mama is here.
It's okay. Mama's here.

563
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:13,941
Okay. Okay.

564
00:46:14,066 --> 00:46:16,902
<i>There you are. Okay.
Okay.</i>

565
00:46:16,985 --> 00:46:19,988
- There we are.
- Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.

566
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:24,243
<i>- I thought I was losing him.
- It's okay. He's gonna be fine.</i>

567
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:30,457
<i>Could you, uh- Could you move the toys
from that bed, please?</i>

568
00:46:30,582 --> 00:46:32,709
Could you move the toys
from that bed, please?

569
00:46:38,674 --> 00:46:42,427
Ah.

570
00:46:42,553 --> 00:46:46,014
Big boy.
Big boy.

571
00:46:46,098 --> 00:46:48,100
Here we go.

572
00:46:50,435 --> 00:46:53,146
It's okay, baby.
I'm so sorry.

573
00:46:53,272 --> 00:46:55,482
It's okay.
Don't say sorry.

574
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:57,860
<i>Don't say sorry.</i>

575
00:46:57,943 --> 00:47:01,154
- This is where you live?
- Yes.

576
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,240
Why not at State House
with the other wives?

577
00:47:03,365 --> 00:47:07,369
Since I had Mackenzie, my husband prefers us
to be somewhere more private.

578
00:47:07,452 --> 00:47:09,329
That's ridiculous.

579
00:47:11,123 --> 00:47:13,125
<i>I think this child
has epilepsy.</i>

580
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:15,169
It's a perfectly treatable
condition.

581
00:47:17,296 --> 00:47:21,550
- The president does visit you here?
- He visits the children, not me.

582
00:47:23,552 --> 00:47:26,180
I am a bad omen.

583
00:47:29,725 --> 00:47:31,435
Okay.

584
00:47:31,518 --> 00:47:34,229
Okay, I'm gonna make an appointment
for Mackenzie at the hospital.

585
00:47:34,313 --> 00:47:36,732
All right?

586
00:47:36,815 --> 00:47:39,318
I will tell the president
how helpful you have been.

587
00:48:49,096 --> 00:48:50,806
<i>Very nice.</i>

588
00:49:00,858 --> 00:49:02,734
<i>Good morning, Nicholas.</i>

589
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:06,238
I could not go without thanking you
for helping my son-

590
00:49:06,321 --> 00:49:07,948
Don't mention it.

591
00:49:08,073 --> 00:49:10,200
and to bring you
a small gift.

592
00:49:13,328 --> 00:49:16,748
No doctor should be
without his ambulance.

593
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:19,042
For me?

594
00:49:19,168 --> 00:49:21,587
Yes. Come. Come.
This is yours here.

595
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:23,672
Oh.

596
00:49:24,882 --> 00:49:27,050
<i>Uh-huh?
What do you think?</i>

597
00:49:27,176 --> 00:49:29,845
Are you serious?
It-It's a fantastic gift.

598
00:49:29,928 --> 00:49:32,556
Are you happy now? Eh?
Let's try it.

599
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:35,767
You can drive me to the airport.
I have to fly to Libya on business.

600
00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:39,605
- Don't you think that I should get dressed?
- Quickly then. Quickly.

601
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:41,899
- Now? Right.
- Yes.

602
00:49:41,982 --> 00:49:43,942
I'll just be a minute.

603
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:54,494
- Are you comfortable here?
- Yeah, very much. Thank you.

604
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,496
Ah.

605
00:50:03,712 --> 00:50:07,883
So, uh, it- it was Obote's men
who attacked the prison, yeah?

606
00:50:07,966 --> 00:50:09,968
- Yes.
- Right.

607
00:50:10,093 --> 00:50:14,181
We heard the gunfire
all the way at the hospital.

608
00:50:14,306 --> 00:50:18,227
- Yes, and my soldiers, they held them off.
- Oh, right.

609
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:20,437
<i>We thought we were going
to be inundated with casualties.</i>

610
00:50:20,521 --> 00:50:23,315
Do you want to drive your car?
I want to see you drive your car.

611
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,317
- Okay.
- Please. Come.

612
00:50:25,442 --> 00:50:27,319
- Come.
- Okay. Okay.

613
00:50:37,663 --> 00:50:41,583
So, you do not like the way
I treat my son.

614
00:50:43,585 --> 00:50:47,381
Uh, no.
No, I don't.

615
00:50:47,506 --> 00:50:50,676
Hiding him away like that,
it's-it's ruining his life.

616
00:50:50,801 --> 00:50:53,345
That boy
has everything he wants.

617
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:56,056
Except the treatment
that could save him.

618
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:58,934
He has comfort
and luxury in life.

619
00:50:59,017 --> 00:51:03,522
- Money? Sir, it's no substitute for anything.
- Nicholas.

620
00:51:03,647 --> 00:51:05,941
You have never been poor.

621
00:51:07,693 --> 00:51:09,987
What about Kay?
Don't you think it's, uh-

622
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:13,156
Do not speak about things
you do not understand.

623
00:51:17,703 --> 00:51:20,080
But the way
you are concerned...

624
00:51:20,205 --> 00:51:23,542
it has touched me,
and I will consider.

625
00:51:24,793 --> 00:51:29,256
You know, I like this type
of frank conversation.

626
00:51:29,381 --> 00:51:32,342
Yes. I respect
your honesty...

627
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:34,344
<i>and your opinion
completely.</i>

628
00:51:35,888 --> 00:51:38,098
- Nicholas!
- Stop!

629
00:51:42,853 --> 00:51:44,855
- Shit! Shit!
- Drive! Drive.

630
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,363
<i>Drive past! Drive!</i>

631
00:51:55,991 --> 00:51:58,911
Drive!

632
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:19,306
Obote's men!
I'm sure of it!

633
00:52:19,431 --> 00:52:21,892
If I had not been
in your car-

634
00:52:22,017 --> 00:52:26,271
But... it is in my dream.

635
00:52:26,396 --> 00:52:30,108
They cannot kill me. It is in my dream.

636
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,992
<i>Somebody told his men
my travel plans.</i>

637
00:52:40,452 --> 00:52:42,913
Somebody is betraying me.

638
00:52:43,914 --> 00:52:46,667
<i>I cannot trust... anybody.</i>

639
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:50,379
I'm surrounded...
by traitors!

640
00:52:58,512 --> 00:53:01,849
Masanga.

641
00:53:01,974 --> 00:53:04,977
Nicholas.
Nicholas.

642
00:53:05,102 --> 00:53:09,815
<i>You know Masanga?
He is one of my people.</i>

643
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:14,528
He will handle all
of my security matters from now on.

644
00:53:14,653 --> 00:53:16,446
Yes, sir.

645
00:53:16,572 --> 00:53:21,326
- You will take care of me and this country.
- Yes, sir.

646
00:53:23,745 --> 00:53:26,874
Where is Jonah Wasswa?
Where is he?

647
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:29,835
I need my minister.

648
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:34,965
A minister should be
by his president's side.

649
00:53:35,048 --> 00:53:37,718
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

650
00:53:37,843 --> 00:53:42,723
And you call yourself
my closest advisor?

651
00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:49,062
Huh?

652
00:53:54,109 --> 00:53:56,528
You see?

653
00:53:56,653 --> 00:53:59,072
You see?
These loyal soldiers...

654
00:53:59,198 --> 00:54:01,575
already they have
captured the criminals.

655
00:54:26,058 --> 00:54:30,687
Do not pity them,
Nicholas.

656
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:34,107
These men here,
they wanted you dead.

657
00:54:36,527 --> 00:54:38,862
Why did you try to kill me?

658
00:54:40,697 --> 00:54:42,574
<i>Huh?</i>

659
00:54:43,617 --> 00:54:47,704
<i>I will not die...
until I say!</i>

660
00:54:50,582 --> 00:54:54,378
Look at me!

661
00:54:58,257 --> 00:55:01,718
<i>Obote!</i>

662
00:55:01,844 --> 00:55:03,929
Huh?

663
00:55:04,054 --> 00:55:06,056
<i>You work for him!</i>

664
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:08,600
Obote! Huh?

665
00:55:08,725 --> 00:55:12,938
That-That...
drunk, silly man!

666
00:55:13,063 --> 00:55:17,442
You want to kill me
for that drunk, silly man?

667
00:55:17,568 --> 00:55:19,444
Huh?

668
00:55:24,575 --> 00:55:26,535
Uganda loves me...

669
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:32,165
because I am loyal...

670
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:34,585
and I am fair.

671
00:55:38,463 --> 00:55:41,758
I am your president.

672
00:55:50,893 --> 00:55:52,895
Come, Nicholas.

673
00:55:52,978 --> 00:55:53,645
<i>This is no place for us.</i>

674
00:57:43,463 --> 00:57:45,883
<i>These I can read you later.</i>

675
00:57:46,008 --> 00:57:48,927
And the rest-The rest
are just pro forma papers for you to sign.

676
00:57:49,052 --> 00:57:52,222
Um, I left a small list
of medical equipment at the end...

677
00:57:52,347 --> 00:57:54,808
<i>for my old surgery
in Mgambo.</i>

678
00:58:05,485 --> 00:58:07,696
<i>Is there anything else,
Nicholas?</i>

679
00:58:14,494 --> 00:58:16,455
Eh?

680
00:58:18,874 --> 00:58:21,126
Nicholas?

681
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:23,337
It's probably nothing, sir.

682
00:58:28,133 --> 00:58:30,093
What?

683
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:39,186
Nicholas, you are
my closest advisor.

684
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:42,105
<i>Please.</i>

685
00:58:42,189 --> 00:58:44,149
<i>Tell me
what is on your mind.</i>

686
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:54,451
Last night, I went to the Holiday Inn
and had a drink.

687
00:58:56,954 --> 00:59:00,999
I saw Jonah Wasswa there
speaking to some white guy in the bar.

688
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:06,088
<i>Something about it
just didn't seem right.</i>

689
00:59:06,213 --> 00:59:08,799
It's- It's probably nothing...

690
00:59:08,924 --> 00:59:11,510
but, uh, you might wanna
have a talk with him.

691
00:59:11,635 --> 00:59:13,595
Just- Just a talk.

692
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:18,934
<i>Like I say,

693
00:59:26,275 --> 00:59:28,235
Good night, sir.

694
00:59:51,758 --> 00:59:55,596
- Ah. How are you?
- Very well. How are you?

695
00:59:55,721 --> 00:59:58,015
Very well.
See you next week.

696
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:01,351
Would you care for a drink?

697
01:00:02,686 --> 01:00:06,648
That's very good, Mackenzie.

698
01:00:11,695 --> 01:00:13,614
<i>Very good.
Go show your brother.</i>

699
01:00:20,204 --> 01:00:22,122
<i>Hiya.</i>

700
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:26,919
Hiya.

701
01:00:29,379 --> 01:00:32,508
Uh, he's looking
much better.

702
01:00:32,591 --> 01:00:35,552
Much better.

703
01:00:35,636 --> 01:00:37,888
That other one is Campbell.

704
01:00:38,013 --> 01:00:39,973
He is the one
who got your T-shirt.

705
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:42,351
You're a man of taste.

706
01:00:43,602 --> 01:00:46,021
<i>Mummy! Mummy!</i>

707
01:00:46,104 --> 01:00:50,108
Please, goodbye.

708
01:00:50,234 --> 01:00:52,611
<i>- Mummy! He keeps pushing me! Mummy!
- Okay, stop it.</i>

709
01:00:52,736 --> 01:00:55,906
<i>Stop it, Mackenzie.</i>

710
01:00:56,031 --> 01:01:00,285
<i>Dr. Garrigan. Daydreaming?</i>

711
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:03,539
Well, looking at you, Stone,
I certainly hope so.

712
01:01:03,622 --> 01:01:06,124
I wasn't expecting to find you here.

713
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:08,710
I thought you'd be with the president
on his trip to London.

714
01:01:08,794 --> 01:01:10,712
No, I'm needed here.

715
01:01:10,796 --> 01:01:15,008
- I do hope the man hasn't blown up again.
- Uh, what?

716
01:01:15,092 --> 01:01:19,054
<i>I was reading this article in the Times.
I don't know if you've seen it.</i>

717
01:01:19,137 --> 01:01:23,058
<i>It seems a high court judge who recently
ruled against Amin has gone missing.</i>

718
01:01:23,183 --> 01:01:27,646
<i>- Hasn't been seen for five days.
- I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation.</i>

719
01:01:27,729 --> 01:01:29,857
Well, the thing is,
we've been getting reports...

720
01:01:29,982 --> 01:01:32,943
up and down the country
of the same thing.

721
01:01:33,068 --> 01:01:36,363
People speaking out
against the regime...

722
01:01:36,446 --> 01:01:38,532
just, uh, disappearing.

723
01:01:38,615 --> 01:01:42,035
No. Look, if you're gonna accuse the president
of something, you just come out and say it.

724
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:44,371
- All right?
- I was just hoping you might be able...

725
01:01:44,496 --> 01:01:46,999
to give us a little
clarification.

726
01:01:47,082 --> 01:01:50,669
Oh, fuck your clarifications,
Stone! Fuck them.

727
01:01:52,254 --> 01:01:54,256
You people amaze me.

728
01:01:54,339 --> 01:01:57,843
You know, the first sign of an independent
African leader actually achieving something...

729
01:01:57,926 --> 01:01:59,845
and what do you do?

730
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:03,390
You spit your dummy because you can't stand
the idea that he's done it without you.

731
01:02:03,473 --> 01:02:06,059
I know he's maybe a little bit rough,
but what do you expect?

732
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:11,523
Do you think Obote's people
are sittin' around waitin' for clarifications?

733
01:02:11,607 --> 01:02:13,650
Look at me.

734
01:02:13,734 --> 01:02:17,487
This is Africa.
You meet violence with violence.

735
01:02:17,571 --> 01:02:20,073
Anything else,
and you're dead.

736
01:02:21,116 --> 01:02:23,035
Well, then perhaps
you'd be so kind...

737
01:02:23,118 --> 01:02:26,872
as to explain to me the whereabouts
of Health Minister Wasswa.

738
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:31,043
What?

739
01:02:31,126 --> 01:02:34,296
Well, he's, uh-
he's missing too.

740
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:36,798
But, as you say,
I'm sure there's some, uh...

741
01:02:36,924 --> 01:02:38,884
perfectly normal
explanation.

742
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:41,678
I'm, uh, having drinks later...

743
01:02:41,762 --> 01:02:44,848
with the man
who wrote the article.

744
01:02:44,932 --> 01:02:47,518
Perhaps you'd like
to join us...

745
01:02:47,601 --> 01:02:49,645
and shed some light
on the matter.

746
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:52,314
- Fine. I will.
- All right. Six o'clockish.

747
01:02:59,154 --> 01:03:01,698
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm here to see the health minister.

748
01:03:01,782 --> 01:03:04,076
I'm afraid she's busy.

749
01:03:22,094 --> 01:03:24,721
<i>You were right.</i>

750
01:03:24,805 --> 01:03:28,851
The health minister has gone missing.
Apparently, he's fled to Tanzania.

751
01:03:28,934 --> 01:03:31,311
<i>What? Jonah Wasswa?</i>

752
01:03:31,436 --> 01:03:33,313
<i>Mmm.</i>

753
01:03:33,438 --> 01:03:37,067
<i>It appears he's embezzled several hundred
thousand pounds' worth of Ministry funds.</i>

754
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:41,029
And some people are suggesting
that he's joined up with Obote's exiles.

755
01:03:41,113 --> 01:03:43,991
<i>- I find that very hard to believe.
- The man was on the verge...</i>

756
01:03:44,116 --> 01:03:46,743
of sealing a major
pharmaceutical deal.

757
01:03:46,869 --> 01:03:51,748
Life-saving penicillin for the masses.

758
01:03:51,832 --> 01:03:55,878
<i>I should know. I set up the meeting
with his South African counterpart...</i>

759
01:03:55,961 --> 01:03:58,046
at, um, the Holiday Inn.

760
01:04:01,592 --> 01:04:05,012
<i>So, this embezzlement-
is it on the record?</i>

761
01:04:06,763 --> 01:04:09,933
- Yes. Yes, it is.
- And I can quote you in the paper?

762
01:04:12,227 --> 01:04:15,439
- I'm sorry? Quote me?
- Not directly, of course.

763
01:04:15,522 --> 01:04:17,441
As a government spokesman.

764
01:04:17,566 --> 01:04:20,444
Government spokesman?

765
01:04:20,527 --> 01:04:22,863
Aye.

766
01:05:03,529 --> 01:05:05,656
Mr. President.

767
01:05:06,698 --> 01:05:09,451
I've come to say good-bye.

768
01:05:09,535 --> 01:05:11,745
I'm going home.

769
01:05:13,038 --> 01:05:14,957
<i>Mr. President?</i>

770
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:18,252
<i>Boo!</i>

771
01:05:20,462 --> 01:05:22,923
I got you.
I got him.

772
01:05:25,133 --> 01:05:28,595
Nicholas, meet my
body double, Wzenga.

773
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,598
Look at him.
Everything the same.

774
01:05:31,682 --> 01:05:33,600
<i>Except-
What do you say, Nicholas?</i>

775
01:05:34,685 --> 01:05:37,145
Is he as handsome as me?

776
01:05:37,271 --> 01:05:40,065
- No. No, he's not.
- Aha! You see?

777
01:05:40,148 --> 01:05:43,944
<i>You see? Nicholas agrees.
You are much more ugly than me, Wzenga.</i>

778
01:05:47,573 --> 01:05:51,410
<i>Look, look, look, Nicholas.
I have others also.</i>

779
01:05:51,493 --> 01:05:56,957
<i>All part of Captain Masanga's plan
for my security.</i>

780
01:05:57,082 --> 01:06:00,085
Clever, huh?

781
01:06:00,169 --> 01:06:02,171
Yeah.

782
01:06:17,269 --> 01:06:19,146
Nicholas.

783
01:06:23,275 --> 01:06:25,152
My Nicholas.

784
01:06:28,614 --> 01:06:33,160
What is all this
about your going home?

785
01:06:33,285 --> 01:06:35,162
Hmm?

786
01:06:39,291 --> 01:06:41,168
We-

787
01:06:41,293 --> 01:06:43,420
<i>You once told me
that you respected me...</i>

788
01:06:43,504 --> 01:06:46,590
'cause I wasn't afraid
to speak my mind.

789
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:48,675
Mmm. Speak.

790
01:06:52,846 --> 01:06:55,390
It's this business with Wasswa.

791
01:06:57,059 --> 01:06:59,436
I can't-

792
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:03,023
It fucking stinks. And I can't help coming
back to that moment...

793
01:07:03,148 --> 01:07:05,776
when I asked you
to talk to him.

794
01:07:05,859 --> 01:07:07,945
Look, this isn't me.

795
01:07:08,028 --> 01:07:10,280
<i>I have to go home now.</i>

796
01:07:10,364 --> 01:07:12,282
You cannot.

797
01:07:13,617 --> 01:07:15,536
What?

798
01:07:15,619 --> 01:07:18,121
<i>Your work is not
finished here yet.</i>

799
01:07:18,205 --> 01:07:21,834
But I didn't come here
to finish anything.

800
01:07:21,917 --> 01:07:23,836
You promised to me...

801
01:07:23,961 --> 01:07:26,505
that you would help
to build a new Uganda.

802
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:29,508
<i>You swore an oath.</i>

803
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:31,593
The oath is, um-

804
01:07:31,718 --> 01:07:34,555
It's- It's a doctor's oath of confidentiality.
We all take it.

805
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,640
- It's got nothing to do with Uganda.
- Huh?

806
01:07:36,723 --> 01:07:40,561
Nothing?
Nothing comes from nothing.

807
01:07:42,312 --> 01:07:44,189
You have a conscience.

808
01:07:44,314 --> 01:07:46,316
I know you do.

809
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:49,987
<i>That is why you came here
in the first place.</i>

810
01:07:50,112 --> 01:07:52,573
Or are you like
all the other British?

811
01:07:54,575 --> 01:07:59,746
Just here to fuck
and to take away.

812
01:07:59,872 --> 01:08:02,082
No.

813
01:08:02,207 --> 01:08:04,626
- No.
- No.

814
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:08,589
Why else would I trust you
with my family?

815
01:08:11,383 --> 01:08:15,470
You are like my own son.

816
01:08:18,807 --> 01:08:21,059
I'm Nicholas Garrigan...

817
01:08:21,185 --> 01:08:23,061
and I'm from Scotland.

818
01:08:23,187 --> 01:08:25,230
That's my home.
I want to go-

819
01:08:25,355 --> 01:08:27,816
Your home is here.

820
01:08:27,941 --> 01:08:30,027
Please.

821
01:08:30,152 --> 01:08:32,029
Just, please-

822
01:08:32,154 --> 01:08:34,531
Do not be a silly boy.

823
01:08:34,615 --> 01:08:39,578
If you go now, what will they think about you
and, uh, Jonah Wasswa?

824
01:08:39,703 --> 01:08:43,123
What are you talkin' about?
I said- I said talk to him.

825
01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:47,836
Do not pretend to yourself
that you did not know.

826
01:08:49,213 --> 01:08:51,840
You are a stronger man
than that.

827
01:08:53,884 --> 01:08:56,386
I didn't want him
to die though.

828
01:08:58,388 --> 01:09:01,225
But you-you did it.

829
01:09:03,644 --> 01:09:07,231
- Why? You want to know why?
- Mm-hmm.

830
01:09:07,356 --> 01:09:10,108
You did it because...

831
01:09:11,401 --> 01:09:13,695
you love me.

832
01:09:15,989 --> 01:09:19,743
You have stepped deep
into the heart of my country.

833
01:09:22,037 --> 01:09:23,997
Uganda.

834
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,209
Uganda embraces you.

835
01:09:35,175 --> 01:09:37,052
Nicholas.

836
01:09:37,177 --> 01:09:39,805
Nicholas.

837
01:09:39,888 --> 01:09:43,141
What you need
is to have some fun.

838
01:10:14,464 --> 01:10:17,801
<i>Hey, Nicholas.
Where have you been?</i>

839
01:10:17,926 --> 01:10:19,928
- I want you to meet Betty.
- Betty.

840
01:10:20,053 --> 01:10:22,764
And this here is her sister Joy.

841
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:24,766
- Joy.
- Hello.

842
01:10:24,892 --> 01:10:27,144
- Hello.
- Joy is going to look after you this weekend.

843
01:10:27,269 --> 01:10:29,605
Joy-

844
01:10:31,773 --> 01:10:34,276
- All right.
- All right.

845
01:10:34,401 --> 01:10:38,697
And now, let the games begin.

846
01:10:39,865 --> 01:10:41,867
Yes.

847
01:10:43,619 --> 01:10:47,915
Nicholas. You did not know we had
Ugandan cowboys, eh?

848
01:10:47,998 --> 01:10:51,376
Finance Minister.

849
01:10:56,757 --> 01:10:59,009
<i>Come here.</i>

850
01:11:01,678 --> 01:11:04,806
All right.

851
01:11:38,298 --> 01:11:40,259
Can I have another whiskey,
please?

852
01:11:48,559 --> 01:11:51,270
<i>Well, let me tell you, Nicholas,
you've chosen a fine life.</i>

853
01:11:54,606 --> 01:11:58,068
<i>You want to kill me for that drunk, silly man?</i>

854
01:12:00,612 --> 01:12:04,867
<i>Nicholas. Nicholas.</i>

855
01:12:10,873 --> 01:12:13,041
<i>Dr. Garrigan.</i>

856
01:12:20,382 --> 01:12:24,052
Jesus fucking Christ,
you look so lovely.

857
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,642
You know something?
I shouldn't be here.

858
01:12:30,726 --> 01:12:34,146
I should be in Scotland
with my dad.

859
01:12:34,271 --> 01:12:37,649
I should be looking after little old ladies,
'cause- 'cause here I've fucked up.

860
01:12:39,818 --> 01:12:42,321
Kay, I fucked up.
I fucked up.

861
01:12:42,404 --> 01:12:44,823
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Not here.

862
01:12:47,993 --> 01:12:50,662
- Walk with me.
- What?

863
01:12:50,787 --> 01:12:52,664
Walk with me.

864
01:13:10,474 --> 01:13:13,602
- I'm fucking doomed.
- Watch your head.

865
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:16,396
You know he's got
go-go dancers after me now?

866
01:13:18,148 --> 01:13:20,150
Where are we going?

867
01:13:20,275 --> 01:13:22,486
I don't know.

868
01:13:22,611 --> 01:13:24,488
<i>Nicky?</i>

869
01:13:24,613 --> 01:13:27,491
Oh, shit!
It's the go-go dancer.

870
01:13:27,574 --> 01:13:30,494
- Oh, uh- uh-
- Nicky?

871
01:13:30,577 --> 01:13:32,746
In here.
In here. Come on.

872
01:13:32,829 --> 01:13:35,874
Just follow me.
Up here.

873
01:13:39,795 --> 01:13:42,965
Shh! Shh!

874
01:13:43,048 --> 01:13:45,717
You be quiet.
Shh!

875
01:13:53,141 --> 01:13:55,018
Oh, fuck it.

876
01:14:53,035 --> 01:14:55,662
He has always
been like this.

877
01:14:55,787 --> 01:14:58,749
He just chose not
to show you until now.

878
01:15:03,212 --> 01:15:05,422
Nicholas.

879
01:15:05,506 --> 01:15:08,133
You have to find
a way to get out.

880
01:15:09,218 --> 01:15:11,386
He still listens to me.

881
01:15:14,181 --> 01:15:17,434
He cannot trust
anybody anymore.

882
01:15:19,895 --> 01:15:22,314
I'll wait
till things get really bad.

883
01:15:22,397 --> 01:15:25,692
They are... really bad.

884
01:15:32,866 --> 01:15:34,993
Huh?

885
01:15:35,077 --> 01:15:37,079
What?

886
01:15:37,204 --> 01:15:39,206
- Nothing.
- What?

887
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:44,461
I just had this mad image
of me and you sittin'...

888
01:15:44,545 --> 01:15:46,588
at my mother and father's
dinner table.

889
01:15:46,713 --> 01:15:49,424
Oh.

890
01:15:52,177 --> 01:15:54,137
"More stew, Mrs. Amin?"

891
01:16:02,563 --> 01:16:04,857
Nicholas.

892
01:16:04,982 --> 01:16:07,317
You've got to get out.

893
01:16:07,401 --> 01:16:10,320
<i>To the lake!
Everybody to the lake! President's order!</i>

894
01:16:10,404 --> 01:16:12,322
Everybody to the lake!
To the lake!

895
01:16:12,406 --> 01:16:14,408
<i>- What is going on?
- President's order!</i>

896
01:16:14,533 --> 01:16:16,743
- I don't know.
- What if somebody saw us?

897
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:23,166
Okay. You just wait two minutes
and then come out after me, all right?

898
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:25,210
Yeah.

899
01:16:27,129 --> 01:16:29,047
Go, go, go, go.

900
01:18:34,381 --> 01:18:36,341
Shit.

901
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,776
Dr. Garrigan.

902
01:18:54,902 --> 01:18:57,154
It's 4:00
in the morning.

903
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:59,156
Can I have a word with you?

904
01:19:03,911 --> 01:19:05,871
- Whiskey?
- Okay.

905
01:19:14,087 --> 01:19:16,340
They've, uh-

906
01:19:16,465 --> 01:19:19,551
They've taken my passport.

907
01:19:19,676 --> 01:19:23,722
You were saying that
if there was ever anything you could do-

908
01:19:25,432 --> 01:19:28,101
I need to get out of here
while I still can.

909
01:19:29,853 --> 01:19:32,356
I was hoping you might
be able to help in that.

910
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:36,568
- Please.
- "Please. " It's a nice touch.

911
01:19:37,611 --> 01:19:39,821
Mmm.

912
01:19:39,947 --> 01:19:43,116
Have you any idea what's
going on in this country, Dr. Garrigan?

913
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:48,789
Some.

914
01:19:48,872 --> 01:19:52,709
In the countryside, they're not even
bothering to dig graves anymore.

915
01:19:52,793 --> 01:19:55,420
They're simply feeding them
to the crocodiles.

916
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:59,007
Right here in Kampala,
right under our noses...

917
01:19:59,132 --> 01:20:03,011
he's wiped out the entire
political opposition.

918
01:20:03,136 --> 01:20:06,306
<i>Thousands of Acholi...</i>

919
01:20:06,431 --> 01:20:09,685
<i>and Langi tribesmen
from the army.</i>

920
01:20:11,103 --> 01:20:13,063
He's hardly even bothering
to cover it up anymore.

921
01:20:17,734 --> 01:20:20,946
<i>Even members of his own cabinet.</i>

922
01:20:22,072 --> 01:20:24,616
Your friend
the health minister.

923
01:20:31,790 --> 01:20:34,960
This man is actually
trying to help his country.

924
01:20:37,087 --> 01:20:39,464
Idi always seems
to get it wrong, doesn't he?

925
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,719
Jesus fucking Christ.

926
01:20:47,264 --> 01:20:49,474
Get me out of here.

927
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,186
<i>You earn
your passage first.</i>

928
01:20:52,311 --> 01:20:54,188
Wha-What?

929
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,652
You know what
they're calling you?

930
01:21:00,777 --> 01:21:02,779
His white monkey.

931
01:21:04,698 --> 01:21:06,658
I'm his doctor.

932
01:21:07,910 --> 01:21:10,078
It's not my job
to judge the man.

933
01:21:10,162 --> 01:21:13,290
<i>"I'm his doctor. "
Is that your defense? How pathetic.</i>

934
01:21:13,373 --> 01:21:15,334
Fuck off, Garrigan.

935
01:21:16,752 --> 01:21:20,339
We don't just hand out passports
to chimps like you.

936
01:21:20,464 --> 01:21:25,427
<i>Particularly not chimps
with blood on their hands.</i>

937
01:21:25,511 --> 01:21:29,890
Look, you, I'm a citizen,
and I have rights.

938
01:21:30,015 --> 01:21:33,310
Fuck your rights. You do as I say,
or you don't get out of here.

939
01:21:35,187 --> 01:21:38,690
You're his doctor.
You have unprecedented access to him.

940
01:21:39,816 --> 01:21:42,694
Obviously,
we'd help you with...

941
01:21:44,738 --> 01:21:47,157
anything you needed.

942
01:21:49,326 --> 01:21:51,245
You want me to kill him?

943
01:22:33,245 --> 01:22:35,163
<i>Amidst persistent rumors...</i>

944
01:22:35,247 --> 01:22:37,958
<i>of human rights violations
and economic mismanagement...</i>

945
01:22:38,041 --> 01:22:40,878
<i>the situation in Uganda
has deteriorated badly in recent months.</i>

946
01:22:43,005 --> 01:22:45,799
<i>The opening of
10 new hospitals has had to be deferred...</i>

947
01:22:45,883 --> 01:22:48,093
<i>and all the rest of them-</i>

948
01:22:50,262 --> 01:22:53,015
<i>But getting any definite
information on the country...</i>

949
01:22:53,098 --> 01:22:55,434
<i>has become harder and harder.
President Amin has accused...</i>

950
01:22:55,517 --> 01:22:57,769
<i>the British government of attempting
to assassinate him and undermining him-</i>

951
01:22:57,853 --> 01:23:01,315
<i>And so his policies
are growing ever more unpredictable.</i>

952
01:23:01,398 --> 01:23:05,485
The British government
has broken its promises to Uganda.

953
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:10,282
<i>Because of this,
I have decided to expel...</i>

954
01:23:10,365 --> 01:23:13,160
all Asians from this country.

955
01:23:13,285 --> 01:23:15,704
And these people,
they are leeches.

956
01:23:15,787 --> 01:23:18,498
They milk the cow...

957
01:23:18,624 --> 01:23:20,834
but they do not want
to feed the cow.

958
01:23:20,959 --> 01:23:24,963
No longer.
They have 90 days to leave.

959
01:23:31,595 --> 01:23:33,305
<i>They are too sick to leave.</i>

960
01:23:36,808 --> 01:23:38,685
Take your hands off him!

961
01:23:38,810 --> 01:23:41,688
This is a sick man. How dare you!

962
01:23:41,772 --> 01:23:43,941
I don't care where
you get your orders from!

963
01:23:44,024 --> 01:23:46,360
<i>You cannot come into a hospital
and start shoving people!</i>

964
01:23:46,443 --> 01:23:48,320
They are forcing us
to leave!

965
01:23:54,826 --> 01:23:56,578
Whoa!

966
01:24:03,961 --> 01:24:06,672
This is a hospital!

967
01:24:06,797 --> 01:24:08,841
You get your men
out of here now!

968
01:24:25,315 --> 01:24:28,694
I'm complaining personally
to the president.

969
01:24:28,777 --> 01:24:30,696
<i>You all right?</i>

970
01:24:35,534 --> 01:24:37,411
I'll see to this.

971
01:24:37,536 --> 01:24:40,706
You're trying to help your people.
I understand that.

972
01:24:40,789 --> 01:24:42,916
But Uganda isn't ready, sir.

973
01:24:43,041 --> 01:24:45,961
You expel the Asians now,
this economy will be on its knees.

974
01:24:46,044 --> 01:24:49,882
Not to mention the damage you'll do
to your reputation abroad.

975
01:24:52,718 --> 01:24:56,096
Is that what
you came here for?

976
01:24:57,556 --> 01:24:59,558
To plead...

977
01:24:59,641 --> 01:25:02,311
for your fucking
Asian tailor?

978
01:25:03,562 --> 01:25:06,648
These things
do not concern you.

979
01:25:07,733 --> 01:25:09,610
You are nothing
but a doctor.

980
01:25:11,653 --> 01:25:13,655
You are a nobody.

981
01:25:17,201 --> 01:25:19,161
Get out.

982
01:25:20,329 --> 01:25:22,247
Get out!

983
01:25:49,608 --> 01:25:52,569
Sarah!
Sarah!

984
01:26:16,844 --> 01:26:20,639
- Hello?
- Oh, I can't believe-

985
01:26:20,764 --> 01:26:22,724
What have we done?

986
01:26:22,808 --> 01:26:24,726
Who?
Kay, is that you?

987
01:26:24,810 --> 01:26:27,020
He is going to kill us,
Nicholas.

988
01:26:27,104 --> 01:26:29,314
He's going to kill us.

989
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:33,569
I have to get it out of me.

990
01:26:35,612 --> 01:26:37,781
He will kill me, Nicholas.

991
01:26:37,906 --> 01:26:39,867
I have to get it out.

992
01:26:43,036 --> 01:26:45,205
<i>- What are we going to do?
- I don't know.</i>

993
01:26:48,417 --> 01:26:50,419
I want you to do it.

994
01:26:50,502 --> 01:26:53,630
Please. You're a doctor.
I know you can do it.

995
01:26:53,755 --> 01:26:56,592
- I know you can do it, Nicholas.
- No, we can't!

996
01:26:56,717 --> 01:26:58,719
I can't do that!

997
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:03,390
This isn't some
simple procedure.

998
01:27:03,515 --> 01:27:06,727
It has to be done under clinical conditions.

999
01:27:06,810 --> 01:27:12,065
<i>I have to- If you don't do something now,
I'm going to have to find a place to go.</i>

1000
01:27:12,191 --> 01:27:16,361
<i>I'm- I'm going to have to get it done
in one of the villages. Is that what you want?</i>

1001
01:27:16,445 --> 01:27:18,530
No. No, you don't.

1002
01:27:18,614 --> 01:27:22,743
Come here. Whatever you do,
you don't do that.

1003
01:27:22,826 --> 01:27:24,745
All right?

1004
01:27:24,828 --> 01:27:27,331
I'm gonna sort
something out. Just...

1005
01:27:28,498 --> 01:27:30,667
promise me you'll
stay in the house.

1006
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:34,004
Please promise me
you'll stay in the house.

1007
01:27:39,635 --> 01:27:42,179
P- Promise me this-

1008
01:27:42,304 --> 01:27:44,431
Promise me this is
going to be all right.

1009
01:27:45,516 --> 01:27:47,476
I promise.

1010
01:27:47,559 --> 01:27:49,728
We'll do it first thing
in the morning.

1011
01:27:51,104 --> 01:27:54,024
- Kay Amin?
- Mm-hmm.

1012
01:27:54,107 --> 01:27:56,610
- The president's wife?
- Yes.

1013
01:27:57,736 --> 01:28:00,781
No. No, no, no.

1014
01:28:00,906 --> 01:28:03,575
- We couldn't do that here. Not at Mulago.
- Why not?

1015
01:28:03,659 --> 01:28:07,037
It's the president's hospital!
He's bound to find out.

1016
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:09,706
- We could do this discretely, Tommy.
- No!

1017
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:15,087
He would kill her and us.
It's too much to risk.

1018
01:28:15,212 --> 01:28:17,756
What other choice
does she have?

1019
01:28:17,881 --> 01:28:21,051
Some-Some backstreet job
in a village somewhere?

1020
01:28:21,134 --> 01:28:24,638
Come on, Thomas.
You know what that means.

1021
01:28:24,763 --> 01:28:28,433
It's the only choice
you've left her.

1022
01:28:29,768 --> 01:28:34,064
But I don't expect it crossed
your mind to wonder, huh?

1023
01:28:34,147 --> 01:28:37,067
A white man
with a black woman.

1024
01:28:38,151 --> 01:28:40,696
What does she need
with such things?

1025
01:28:41,738 --> 01:28:44,616
Fine.

1026
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:46,827
I'll do it myself.

1027
01:28:59,673 --> 01:29:04,136
The president
wants to see you now.

1028
01:29:21,945 --> 01:29:23,989
My head is exploding!

1029
01:29:24,114 --> 01:29:27,993
I- I can't think!
I can't sleep!

1030
01:29:28,118 --> 01:29:30,204
Look at this!
Look at this!

1031
01:29:30,329 --> 01:29:34,666
The British newspapers
say I am a madman.

1032
01:29:34,791 --> 01:29:39,338
The American newspapers
say I am a cannibal.

1033
01:29:39,463 --> 01:29:42,049
I am a cannibal, huh?
Huh?

1034
01:29:42,174 --> 01:29:44,051
These are lies!

1035
01:29:44,176 --> 01:29:47,012
I should throw them out
for good.

1036
01:29:47,137 --> 01:29:49,139
Only Ugandan press
from now on.

1037
01:29:49,264 --> 01:29:51,558
- Do you want something for the headache, sir?
- No.

1038
01:29:51,683 --> 01:29:54,520
- Something to help you sleep perhaps?
- Later.

1039
01:29:54,645 --> 01:29:57,314
I want you to tell me
what to do.

1040
01:29:57,439 --> 01:29:59,816
You want me to tell you
what to do?

1041
01:29:59,942 --> 01:30:01,818
Yes. You are my advisor.

1042
01:30:01,944 --> 01:30:04,738
You are the only one
I can trust in here.

1043
01:30:04,821 --> 01:30:08,075
You should have told me not to throw
the Asians out in the first place.

1044
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:10,077
I did.

1045
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:12,204
But you did not
persuade me, Nicholas.

1046
01:30:12,329 --> 01:30:15,249
You did not persuade me.

1047
01:30:15,332 --> 01:30:17,251
Huh?

1048
01:30:19,586 --> 01:30:21,505
Tell me what to do here.

1049
01:30:28,846 --> 01:30:31,390
Don't throw
the journalists out.

1050
01:30:31,515 --> 01:30:34,351
They're only gonna write
more lies about you.

1051
01:30:35,978 --> 01:30:39,147
Invite them to meet you
face-to-face.

1052
01:30:39,231 --> 01:30:41,191
You charm them.

1053
01:30:44,278 --> 01:30:47,531
You show them
what kind of a man you are.

1054
01:30:50,492 --> 01:30:52,452
Hmm.

1055
01:30:55,205 --> 01:30:57,791
You think this will work?

1056
01:30:57,875 --> 01:31:00,127
<i>I think that's the Amin
they need to see.</i>

1057
01:31:03,505 --> 01:31:05,424
Thank you.

1058
01:31:05,507 --> 01:31:07,426
Thank you very much,
Nicholas.

1059
01:31:09,511 --> 01:31:11,430
What would I do
without my Nicholas, huh?

1060
01:31:11,513 --> 01:31:13,473
What would I do
without my Nicholas?

1061
01:31:20,981 --> 01:31:23,150
Is there something
going on here?

1062
01:31:23,233 --> 01:31:25,402
- Huh?
- No.

1063
01:31:25,527 --> 01:31:27,404
No.

1064
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,118
- No.
- Is there?

1065
01:31:33,202 --> 01:31:35,746
- No.
- Huh?

1066
01:31:35,871 --> 01:31:39,208
- No.
- Are you sure, Nicholas?

1067
01:31:39,291 --> 01:31:41,293
Yes.

1068
01:31:41,376 --> 01:31:44,963
Yes.

1069
01:31:46,006 --> 01:31:47,883
Give me a booster.

1070
01:31:48,008 --> 01:31:49,885
Something to make me
feel strong again.

1071
01:32:17,037 --> 01:32:20,582
- Sir.
- Where are you going, Nicholas?

1072
01:32:20,707 --> 01:32:24,545
I have, uh, something
that I have to attend to.

1073
01:32:24,628 --> 01:32:26,922
Uh-uh.
No.

1074
01:32:27,047 --> 01:32:28,924
<i>You have to stay here.</i>

1075
01:32:29,049 --> 01:32:31,802
<i>I need you for
the press conference.</i>

1076
01:32:43,814 --> 01:32:47,609
This is all very well, Your Excellency,
but what about the reports of mass killings?

1077
01:32:47,734 --> 01:32:51,613
Who have you been talking with?
The British?

1078
01:32:52,739 --> 01:32:55,951
<i>Go. Look around Uganda
for missing people.</i>

1079
01:32:56,076 --> 01:32:58,036
<i>Go anywhere you please.</i>

1080
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:00,330
<i>So why would the British spread these rumors?</i>

1081
01:33:03,417 --> 01:33:04,960
<i>Yeah?</i>

1082
01:33:05,085 --> 01:33:07,796
Because... they hate me...

1083
01:33:07,921 --> 01:33:11,341
because I refuse
to recognize South Africa-

1084
01:33:11,466 --> 01:33:14,386
a racist regime
that they support.

1085
01:33:15,470 --> 01:33:17,890
Also, they are
jealous of me.

1086
01:33:18,015 --> 01:33:19,892
<i>Why?</i>

1087
01:33:19,975 --> 01:33:23,854
<i>Because while they are starving
with their strikes and with their protests...</i>

1088
01:33:23,937 --> 01:33:27,524
the people of Uganda are eating
beef and driving big cars.

1089
01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:32,404
I have-

1090
01:33:32,487 --> 01:33:36,658
I have created
the Save Britain Fund.

1091
01:33:36,742 --> 01:33:41,121
We Ugandans, we like to help our friends.
So, the Ugandans have got together...

1092
01:33:41,246 --> 01:33:44,625
<i>and saved three tons
of food and vegetables...</i>

1093
01:33:44,750 --> 01:33:47,920
<i>for their friends in England.</i>

1094
01:33:48,045 --> 01:33:50,881
Because they are having economic difficulties,
let me assure you here.

1095
01:34:05,771 --> 01:34:07,689
Kay?

1096
01:34:07,773 --> 01:34:12,194
It's Nick.
Kay, it's okay. It's Nick.

1097
01:34:15,405 --> 01:34:19,409
- What?
- She went to the village.

1098
01:34:20,577 --> 01:34:22,788
We had to take her
to hospital.

1099
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:30,712
<i>It's been reported that you've
crowned yourself the last king of Scotland.</i>

1100
01:34:30,796 --> 01:34:34,091
Yes. My good friends,
the Scottish people...

1101
01:34:34,174 --> 01:34:37,219
have seen how I have
defeated the English here...

1102
01:34:37,344 --> 01:34:39,638
and they want me to do
the same for them there.

1103
01:34:49,481 --> 01:34:51,316
Yeah, her.
This woman here.

1104
01:34:51,441 --> 01:34:55,779
<i>Did you "wrote" the queen of England,
offering yourself as a lover?</i>

1105
01:34:55,863 --> 01:35:00,784
<i>You- You- You are- You are very cheeky.</i>

1106
01:35:57,257 --> 01:35:59,927
And this is what happens
when you betray the president.

1107
01:36:02,054 --> 01:36:05,724
This is what happens
when you betray him.

1108
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,823
<i>I'm not turned off to sex.</i>

1109
01:37:02,948 --> 01:37:06,201
<i>I enjoy it.
I could spend the rest of my life getting laid.</i>

1110
01:37:16,962 --> 01:37:20,007
<i>There should be more to it
than a lot of little tingles.</i>

1111
01:37:35,397 --> 01:37:39,860
They say she has a clitoris
halfway down her throat.

1112
01:37:39,985 --> 01:37:43,405
Is this possible...
medically?

1113
01:37:43,488 --> 01:37:46,325
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1114
01:37:46,408 --> 01:37:48,535
Almost all aberrations of nature
are possible.

1115
01:37:53,373 --> 01:37:55,626
I made an example of her...

1116
01:37:57,211 --> 01:37:59,296
<i>because she betrayed me.</i>

1117
01:38:03,342 --> 01:38:06,178
I brought you those headache
pills that you asked for.

1118
01:38:07,304 --> 01:38:09,264
Good.

1119
01:38:12,017 --> 01:38:13,894
Is there anything else?

1120
01:38:14,019 --> 01:38:15,896
No. No, that's all.

1121
01:38:19,775 --> 01:38:21,985
Then go.

1122
01:38:22,110 --> 01:38:24,404
We are busy here.

1123
01:39:00,315 --> 01:39:03,110
<i>Uh-huh.
Allפ?</i>

1124
01:39:10,617 --> 01:39:12,870
Good morning.

1125
01:39:18,166 --> 01:39:20,711
Come on.

1126
01:39:22,212 --> 01:39:24,381
- Shit.
- Hello?

1127
01:39:24,506 --> 01:39:26,967
- Yes?
- Come on.

1128
01:39:27,050 --> 01:39:29,261
Yes, sir.

1129
01:39:32,014 --> 01:39:33,724
Nicholas,
there you are!

1130
01:39:33,849 --> 01:39:36,560
- Were you trying to run away from me?
- No. No.

1131
01:39:36,685 --> 01:39:38,604
- Huh?
- No.

1132
01:39:41,732 --> 01:39:44,234
I need you at the airport
right away...

1133
01:39:44,359 --> 01:39:47,529
- to help me with the hostages.
- H-Hostages?

1134
01:39:47,654 --> 01:39:52,868
Yes. An Air France aeroplane has been hijacked
by our Palestinian brothers.

1135
01:39:52,951 --> 01:39:55,329
They have landed here
at Entebbe.

1136
01:39:56,413 --> 01:39:59,833
The eyes of the world
are on Uganda today.

1137
01:39:59,917 --> 01:40:02,586
Come, Nicholas.
To work.

1138
01:40:20,354 --> 01:40:22,397
How many passengers?

1139
01:40:22,523 --> 01:40:24,942
250?

1140
01:40:25,067 --> 01:40:27,861
<i>And how many of them
are Zionist?</i>

1141
01:40:30,322 --> 01:40:32,241
And, uh, television?

1142
01:40:32,324 --> 01:40:34,618
<i>Plenty of
television cameras?</i>

1143
01:40:38,455 --> 01:40:43,085
<i>Mmm. Yes. Tell them to take the hostages
to the terminal building.</i>

1144
01:41:01,895 --> 01:41:04,940
<i>- Mr. President, the press is waiting for you, sir.
- All right.</i>

1145
01:41:18,078 --> 01:41:23,750
<i>I wanted to assure you that the hostages
will get the best medical care.</i>

1146
01:41:23,876 --> 01:41:26,378
<i>I have made
my own doctor available.</i>

1147
01:41:44,146 --> 01:41:46,356
Doctor? Doctor,
what's the situation here?

1148
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:48,400
We've one woman
with a heart condition.

1149
01:41:48,483 --> 01:41:50,736
She's already gone to hospital.
A few cases of shock.

1150
01:41:50,861 --> 01:41:52,696
<i>And we're giving malaria pills
to everyone.</i>

1151
01:41:52,779 --> 01:41:55,324
<i>- Okay, who's not been seen by a doctor yet?
- I haven't.</i>

1152
01:41:55,449 --> 01:41:57,868
<i>- We haven't.
- How many of you are there?</i>

1153
01:41:57,951 --> 01:42:00,495
<i>- I haven't, please.
- You neither?</i>

1154
01:42:00,579 --> 01:42:04,666
<i>- You've not been seen yet?
- Malaria pills. How is everybody doing?</i>

1155
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:07,085
Thank you very much.

1156
01:42:07,211 --> 01:42:10,881
Okay. Um, okay. Anybody else?

1157
01:42:13,592 --> 01:42:15,511
<i>Okay. Take these three.</i>

1158
01:42:15,594 --> 01:42:18,388
<i>The nurse is gonna
come round with water. Nurse?</i>

1159
01:42:21,141 --> 01:42:24,728
Thomas? Thomas, can you
take these, please?

1160
01:42:24,811 --> 01:42:26,730
- All right.
- Just be two minutes.

1161
01:42:26,813 --> 01:42:28,732
Just take one.
Malaria pills. Thank you.

1162
01:42:49,586 --> 01:42:51,463
<i>Stop! Don't!</i>

1163
01:42:51,588 --> 01:42:55,008
Spit.

1164
01:43:53,984 --> 01:43:55,986
Look at you.

1165
01:43:58,030 --> 01:44:02,409
Is there one thing
you have done that is good?

1166
01:44:05,162 --> 01:44:07,623
Did you think
this was all a game?

1167
01:44:08,665 --> 01:44:11,460
"I will go to Africa...

1168
01:44:11,585 --> 01:44:16,089
and I will play the white man
with the natives. "

1169
01:44:17,716 --> 01:44:20,469
Is that what you thought?

1170
01:44:20,552 --> 01:44:23,722
<i>We are not a game, Nicholas.</i>

1171
01:44:25,641 --> 01:44:29,102
We are real.

1172
01:44:29,228 --> 01:44:31,939
This room here-

1173
01:44:32,022 --> 01:44:33,941
it is real.

1174
01:44:35,317 --> 01:44:38,445
<i>I think your death...</i>

1175
01:44:38,570 --> 01:44:41,114
will be the first
real thing...

1176
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:43,200
that has happened to you.

1177
01:44:45,452 --> 01:44:48,038
Listen to me, Nicholas.

1178
01:44:48,163 --> 01:44:50,415
Listen.
I know.

1179
01:44:50,499 --> 01:44:52,417
Yes.

1180
01:44:52,501 --> 01:44:57,589
I know about you and Kay.

1181
01:45:00,467 --> 01:45:02,427
How could you do that to me?

1182
01:45:05,764 --> 01:45:09,685
I am the father
of this nation, Nicholas.

1183
01:45:09,810 --> 01:45:13,063
And you have most grossly...

1184
01:45:13,146 --> 01:45:15,816
offended your father.

1185
01:45:20,112 --> 01:45:22,781
You're a child.

1186
01:45:24,825 --> 01:45:28,036
That's what makes you
so fucking scary.

1187
01:45:48,182 --> 01:45:50,184
In my village...

1188
01:45:51,351 --> 01:45:54,188
when you steal...

1189
01:45:54,313 --> 01:45:57,274
the wife of an elder...

1190
01:45:58,859 --> 01:46:01,320
they take you to a tree...

1191
01:46:01,445 --> 01:46:03,822
and they hang you
by your skin.

1192
01:46:05,032 --> 01:46:08,160
Each time you scream...

1193
01:46:08,243 --> 01:46:11,997
the evil comes out of you.

1194
01:46:14,666 --> 01:46:17,669
Sometimes it can take
three days...

1195
01:46:17,753 --> 01:46:21,840
for your evil to be spent.

1196
01:46:26,762 --> 01:46:29,681
Pull him up.

1197
01:48:38,894 --> 01:48:41,063
Good evening.

1198
01:48:41,188 --> 01:48:43,148
I have good news.

1199
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:48,028
The Israeli government
has agreed to negotiate.

1200
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:54,243
So, as a gesture
of good faith...

1201
01:48:54,368 --> 01:48:58,539
all non-Israeli hostages
will be released.

1202
01:49:00,624 --> 01:49:03,085
I have arranged,
personally...

1203
01:49:03,210 --> 01:49:06,755
an aeroplane to come
and collect you.

1204
01:49:09,633 --> 01:49:11,552
Yes, yes.

1205
01:49:28,402 --> 01:49:30,863
He'll be here
when we come back.

1206
01:49:33,282 --> 01:49:36,076
<i>This way, Israelis!</i>

1207
01:49:53,051 --> 01:49:55,220
<i>Israelis stay here.</i>

1208
01:50:23,790 --> 01:50:25,709
They have sent a plane.

1209
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:28,462
They are releasing
some of the hostages.

1210
01:50:28,587 --> 01:50:32,299
If you go now, you will
reach them before they leave.

1211
01:50:32,424 --> 01:50:34,301
Here. Put this on.

1212
01:50:35,844 --> 01:50:38,347
Why-Why are you
doing this?

1213
01:50:39,389 --> 01:50:41,391
Frankly...

1214
01:50:41,475 --> 01:50:43,393
I don't know.

1215
01:50:46,605 --> 01:50:48,815
You deserve to die.

1216
01:50:48,941 --> 01:50:50,817
But dead,
you can do nothing.

1217
01:50:50,943 --> 01:50:53,362
Alive...

1218
01:50:53,445 --> 01:50:56,198
you might just be able
to redeem yourself.

1219
01:50:56,281 --> 01:50:58,909
I don't understand.

1220
01:51:00,827 --> 01:51:05,791
I am tired of hatred,
Dr. Garrigan.

1221
01:51:05,874 --> 01:51:08,961
This country
is drowning in it.

1222
01:51:09,086 --> 01:51:11,004
We deserve better.

1223
01:51:12,548 --> 01:51:16,093
Go home. Tell the world
the truth about Amin.

1224
01:51:17,719 --> 01:51:19,930
They will believe you.

1225
01:51:20,013 --> 01:51:21,974
You are a white man.

1226
01:51:46,081 --> 01:51:47,958
What about you?

1227
01:51:48,083 --> 01:51:49,960
My fate is in God's hands.

1228
01:51:50,085 --> 01:51:52,504
<i>Go. Now. Before they come back.</i>

1229
01:51:53,630 --> 01:51:55,507
Thank you.

1230
01:51:55,632 --> 01:51:57,676
Go. Go.

1231
01:53:31,395 --> 01:53:35,107
<i>I said stop!</i>

1232
01:53:37,818 --> 01:53:39,820
Where is the doctor?

1233
01:53:42,447 --> 01:53:44,575
I don't know.

1234
01:53:48,412 --> 01:53:50,038
Destination Paris.

1235
01:54:06,513 --> 01:54:09,141
My wife-

1236
01:54:19,193 --> 01:54:23,030
Because many of the people who,
uh, broke relations with Israel...

1237
01:54:23,155 --> 01:54:25,574
<i>they are not only Muslims,
they are also Christians.</i>

1238
01:54:25,699 --> 01:54:27,618
This particular certain point
is very important-

1239

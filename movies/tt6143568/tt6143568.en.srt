00:40:05,847 --> 00:40:09,111
subversives hiding among us

486
00:40:09,113 --> 00:40:11,810
who would destroy
what we have left.

487
00:40:11,812 --> 00:40:13,778
They don't believe
this government

488
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,677
is a democracy anymore.

489
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:20,310
And whatever Kross is planning,

490
00:40:20,312 --> 00:40:24,810
it's your responsibility to make
sure he doesn't succeed.

491
00:40:24,812 --> 00:40:27,644
Those we've deemed expendable
need to believe

492
00:40:27,646 --> 00:40:30,378
there's a better life
waiting for them.

493
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,377
They need hope.

494
00:40:33,379 --> 00:40:37,013
And we can't allow that
illusion to be destroyed.

495
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:52,614
I had these brought here
so I could make a point.

496
00:40:54,646 --> 00:40:56,613
Huh.

497
00:41:00,245 --> 00:41:02,180
What is that?

498
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:05,179
Is that tooth or bone?

499
00:41:06,879 --> 00:41:09,243
I believe that's
a child's tooth.

500
00:41:09,245 --> 00:41:12,746
Yeah, you're right, it is.

501
00:41:14,746 --> 00:41:18,044
So you take a good look
at that, Westinghouse.

502
00:41:18,046 --> 00:41:21,144
Now you find Kross, and
you find him quickly

503
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:24,714
or you may find yourself
in New Eden as well.

504
00:41:48,145 --> 00:41:50,680
[flies buzzing]

505
00:42:12,412 --> 00:42:14,077
Is it yours?

506
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,410
Yes... but it's yours now.

507
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:21,313
I want you to have it.

508
00:42:22,145 --> 00:42:24,844
- For keeps?
- Yeah.

509
00:42:24,846 --> 00:42:27,012
Thanks.

510
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,343
Why do you look so sad?

511
00:42:32,345 --> 00:42:35,647
- Have we run out of luck?
- No. We've got plenty left.

512
00:42:39,045 --> 00:42:40,946
Check that out.

513
00:42:43,412 --> 00:42:45,943
Jackfish Lake.

514
00:42:45,945 --> 00:42:47,876
Is that where we're going?

515
00:42:47,878 --> 00:42:49,880
What?

516
00:42:52,113 --> 00:42:55,311
Canada. That's your plan.
There are no lakes anymore.

517
00:42:55,313 --> 00:42:57,913
Not there or anywhere else.

518
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:01,944
It looks really nice.

519
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:04,212
[Noah] Lucas, let's get
back in the car.

520
00:43:06,213 --> 00:43:09,777
- You can't...
- Don't disappoint him.

521
00:43:09,779 --> 00:43:12,980
[Lucas] Next stop,
Jackfish Lake.

522
00:43:19,812 --> 00:43:22,781
[footsteps]

523
00:43:37,646 --> 00:43:40,680
Second place, national
fly fishing competition.

524
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,146
[clatters]

525
00:43:55,213 --> 00:43:57,147
[can opens]

526
00:44:38,778 --> 00:44:40,910
It's in great shape for its age.

527
00:44:40,912 --> 00:44:44,711
Its age? They stopped making
vehicles 30 years ago.

528
00:44:44,713 --> 00:44:47,344
This is an El Camino.
The last of its kind.

529
00:44:47,346 --> 00:44:49,143
You won't find
anything better.

530
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:51,580
Can you open the hood?

531
00:44:54,711 --> 00:44:56,809
It's smells, mom.

532
00:44:56,811 --> 00:44:59,845
Yeah, but it has four wheels,
and that's what counts.

533
00:45:02,346 --> 00:45:04,179
[sighs]

534
00:45:06,113 --> 00:45:08,147
[door closes]

535
00:45:08,878 --> 00:45:11,277
And if I get caught
with your vehicle?

536
00:45:11,279 --> 00:45:13,913
That battery alone
is worth $1000.

537
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,011
Straight swap. Your El Camino
for the station wagon.

538
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:23,143
I need some food and water.

539
00:45:23,145 --> 00:45:26,410
Twenty bottles of water,
and a case of baked beans.

540
00:45:26,412 --> 00:45:30,343
- Clean water.
- Clean enough.

541
00:45:30,345 --> 00:45:33,812
And I'll need that fancy watch
on your wrist.

542
00:45:36,179 --> 00:45:38,746
I need directions.

543
00:45:41,647 --> 00:45:45,110
There are no roads north,
not anymore.

544
00:45:45,112 --> 00:45:48,111
- You won't get across the border.
- Says who?

545
00:45:48,113 --> 00:45:52,180
Says those who tried and came
back. You're not the first.

546
00:45:58,711 --> 00:46:02,810
[sighs]
There's a man I met years ago.

547
00:46:02,812 --> 00:46:06,713
He might be able to help you
if he's still alive.

548
00:46:20,045 --> 00:46:22,212
Thank you.

549
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:25,143
- Floor?
- Uh, three please.

550
00:46:25,145 --> 00:46:27,046
Three.

551
00:46:30,379 --> 00:46:33,677
Well, isn't that so very odd.

552
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:36,311
The key that I found
in your bedroom

553
00:46:36,313 --> 00:46:40,244
fits the control panel
in this elevator.

554
00:46:40,246 --> 00:46:43,910
- Who are you?
- What did you give Noah Kross?

555
00:46:43,912 --> 00:46:47,077
I don't know that name. I don't
know what you're talking about.

556
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:50,076
Listen to me, Irving Ravetch.

557
00:46:50,078 --> 00:46:53,909
You're a subcontractor for the
Department of National Defense.

558
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:56,676
You are given very
sensitive information,

559
00:46:56,678 --> 00:46:59,146
and you are sworn to secrecy.

560
00:47:00,246 --> 00:47:02,976
This is your son.

561
00:47:02,978 --> 00:47:06,809
This... is your wife.

562
00:47:06,811 --> 00:47:08,709
Would you like to see
them again?

563
00:47:08,711 --> 00:47:10,277
They are not involved.

564
00:47:10,279 --> 00:47:14,043
What did you give him?
How much does he know?

565
00:47:14,045 --> 00:47:16,710
You have ten seconds to
save your family, Irving.

566
00:47:16,712 --> 00:47:19,744
Nine, eight, seven, six...

567
00:47:19,746 --> 00:47:22,144
- Project Eden.
- five, four...

568
00:47:22,146 --> 00:47:25,277
- I gave him Eden.
- three, two...

569
00:47:25,279 --> 00:47:27,280
one.

570
00:47:30,245 --> 00:47:33,410
Did he...

571
00:47:33,412 --> 00:47:36,177
come to you...

572
00:47:36,179 --> 00:47:38,877
for this information, Irving?

573
00:47:38,879 --> 00:47:41,780
All he wanted was the truth.

574
00:47:49,313 --> 00:47:53,144
Pick up the pictures...

575
00:47:53,146 --> 00:47:57,111
of your wife and son, Irving.
Do it now.

576
00:47:57,113 --> 00:47:59,047
[gasps]

577
00:48:07,146 --> 00:48:12,277
Go home, Irving, to your family.

578
00:48:12,279 --> 00:48:14,680
They're waiting for you.

579
00:48:38,046 --> 00:48:40,343
[Rachel] Hey, you wear
those shoes out,

580
00:48:40,345 --> 00:48:42,745
you're walking barefoot
in the snow.

581
00:48:46,145 --> 00:48:47,810
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

582
00:48:47,812 --> 00:48:50,110
[crashing]

583
00:48:50,112 --> 00:48:52,177
[grunts]

584
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,779
- Damn it, where is he? He's gone.
- Lucas.

585
00:48:58,146 --> 00:48:59,879
[gunshot]

586
00:49:02,412 --> 00:49:04,143
Hey!

587
00:49:04,145 --> 00:49:06,713
What is your business
here, stranger?

588
00:49:28,778 --> 00:49:30,776
I am sorry for your
welcoming committee,

589
00:49:30,778 --> 00:49:32,877
but we can't be too careful.

590
00:49:32,879 --> 00:49:35,176
My wife was murdered by
scavengers last year,

591
00:49:35,178 --> 00:49:38,313
and my daughter raped.

592
00:49:40,878 --> 00:49:42,909
Adolf Schroder.

593
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:46,076
Mm.

594
00:49:46,078 --> 00:49:48,776
I am German.

595
00:49:48,778 --> 00:49:52,676
I came here on vacation
with my parents as a boy.

596
00:49:52,678 --> 00:49:54,710
[chuckles]

597
00:49:54,712 --> 00:49:58,144
Things... did not go well.

598
00:49:58,146 --> 00:50:01,779
And as you can see, they
didn't get much better.

599
00:50:04,078 --> 00:50:06,780
It's not wise to mess
with Mother Nature.

600
00:50:08,678 --> 00:50:11,344
You can only spew so much
shit into the air and water

601
00:50:11,346 --> 00:50:13,780
before she starts
to fight back.

602
00:50:17,246 --> 00:50:20,409
We were told you could help us.

603
00:50:20,411 --> 00:50:22,677
Who told you this lie?

604
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:26,977
- [Rachel] Farmer.
- I know no farmer.

605
00:50:26,979 --> 00:50:30,144
That's you in the picture,
isn't it?

606
00:50:30,146 --> 00:50:34,176
Ah, yes, I remember her now.

607
00:50:34,178 --> 00:50:38,744
We were very young.

608
00:50:38,746 --> 00:50:42,977
Her father sold us a car.
We didn't get very far in it.

609
00:50:42,979 --> 00:50:45,213
You can keep it.

610
00:50:51,113 --> 00:50:54,243
[exhales] What do you need?

611
00:50:54,245 --> 00:50:56,943
A way north.

612
00:50:56,945 --> 00:51:00,080
Across the border,
into Canada.

613
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:07,777
The land of a thousand lakes.

614
00:51:07,779 --> 00:51:09,310
When did you last visit?

615
00:51:09,312 --> 00:51:12,044
When I was seven with
my mother. Why?

616
00:51:12,046 --> 00:51:17,643
Like the farmer,
your lakes may have changed.

617
00:51:17,645 --> 00:51:21,144
Then again, they may
not be there at all.

618
00:51:21,146 --> 00:51:24,076
But you are going to find out
when you get there.

619
00:51:24,078 --> 00:51:26,010
That is certain.

620
00:51:26,012 --> 00:51:28,779
[laughs]

621
00:51:46,678 --> 00:51:50,177
Yes, that is done. Yes, yes,
now. Where was I?

622
00:51:50,179 --> 00:51:53,310
Ah, yes. There is only
one way north.

623
00:51:53,312 --> 00:51:57,810
If you go, you cannot come back.

624
00:51:57,812 --> 00:52:01,342
Chances are highly likely
you won't make it at all.

625
00:52:01,344 --> 00:52:03,643
You will need this.

626
00:52:03,645 --> 00:52:06,211
[grunts]

627
00:52:06,213 --> 00:52:10,880
It's, uh, it's old,
but it still works.

628
00:52:13,845 --> 00:52:16,876
It measures radiation.

629
00:52:16,878 --> 00:52:19,612
Yeah, I-I know what it's for.

630
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:31,944
What's, what's this?

631
00:52:31,946 --> 00:52:36,044
It's a rabbit's foot.
You know, for luck.

632
00:52:36,046 --> 00:52:40,080
- Not for the rabbit.
- I'm sure it was delicious.

633
00:52:43,945 --> 00:52:46,112
[glass shattering]

634
00:53:04,012 --> 00:53:06,712
[ripping]

635
00:53:11,312 --> 00:53:13,146
[sighs]

636
00:53:15,911 --> 00:53:20,310
The border is heavily fortified
from sea to sea.

637
00:53:20,312 --> 00:53:25,176
There is no way over, under,
or through it. Mm-hm?

638
00:53:25,178 --> 00:53:28,643
No one knows what's on
the other side for sure,

639
00:53:28,645 --> 00:53:35,077
but if you are determined, first
you must go west, then north.

640
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:37,744
There will be no food or water.

641
00:53:37,746 --> 00:53:40,977
Do not eat the snow,
as it will make you sick.

642
00:53:40,979 --> 00:53:45,343
Now, anyone who approaches
you will be hostile.

643
00:53:45,345 --> 00:53:47,743
So don't be fooled
by false smiles.

644
00:53:47,745 --> 00:53:51,343
They will rape you
and the boy.

645
00:53:51,345 --> 00:53:55,909
You will go where
no one dares to go.

646
00:53:55,911 --> 00:53:59,710
Now here you will see the column
of a nuclear power station.

647
00:53:59,712 --> 00:54:02,144
There was a meltdown in
reactors three and four

648
00:54:02,146 --> 00:54:04,877
and the government tried to hush
it up, but was unsuccessful.

649
00:54:04,879 --> 00:54:07,243
As a result the area is
highly contaminated

650
00:54:07,245 --> 00:54:09,276
with radioactive isotopes.

651
00:54:09,278 --> 00:54:11,910
Nobody dares go near it.

652
00:54:11,912 --> 00:54:13,913
Oh, yes.

653
00:54:17,911 --> 00:54:21,910
You will need this.
Iodine tablets.

654
00:54:21,912 --> 00:54:24,810
The directions
are on the label.

655
00:54:24,812 --> 00:54:27,176
You start taking them
as soon as you see

656
00:54:27,178 --> 00:54:29,947
the reactor's cooling towers.

657
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:35,746
Thank you.

658
00:54:48,811 --> 00:54:51,210
[cocks gun]

659
00:54:51,212 --> 00:54:53,844
Glock 18.

660
00:54:53,846 --> 00:54:56,713
Nine millimeter.

661
00:54:58,412 --> 00:55:01,776
Have you killed anyone?

662
00:55:01,778 --> 00:55:03,809
Not yet.

663
00:55:03,811 --> 00:55:06,612
But I will if I have to.

664
00:55:20,078 --> 00:55:22,346
[banging, dishes breaking]

665
00:55:25,879 --> 00:55:29,046
[clattering]

666
00:55:35,911 --> 00:55:38,312
Amanda Douglas.

667
00:55:40,145 --> 00:55:43,846
Will the real Rachel Weller
please stand up?

668
00:55:56,278 --> 00:55:58,844
We'll die if we head north.

669
00:55:58,846 --> 00:56:01,276
It's suicide.

670
00:56:01,278 --> 00:56:03,977
We'll die if we stay here.

671
00:56:03,979 --> 00:56:06,744
I'll tell them
it was all my fault.

672
00:56:06,746 --> 00:56:08,809
I'll tell them whatever
they want.

673
00:56:08,811 --> 00:56:11,110
There's no going back.

674
00:56:11,112 --> 00:56:13,713
What you had doesn't
exist anymore.

675
00:56:15,811 --> 00:56:17,910
You said New Eden
was a beginning.

676
00:56:17,912 --> 00:56:20,643
Forget what I said.

677
00:56:20,645 --> 00:56:23,310
Well, it can't be worse
than this.

678
00:56:23,312 --> 00:56:26,809
Well why don't you just
try and get some sleep.

679
00:56:26,811 --> 00:56:30,109
We've got a long journey
ahead of us.

680
00:56:30,111 --> 00:56:33,746
Mexican asters
don't grow anymore.

681
00:56:57,311 --> 00:57:00,777
Hey, Lucas, where's your
rabbit's foot?

682
00:57:00,779 --> 00:57:03,109
- My pocket.
- Don't lose it.

683
00:57:03,111 --> 00:57:05,645
I won't.

684
00:57:26,177 --> 00:57:29,009
I come here once a month,
Porter.

685
00:57:29,011 --> 00:57:32,343
Whether I want to or not.

686
00:57:32,345 --> 00:57:34,810
It's a time share.

687
00:57:34,812 --> 00:57:37,178
You would hate me if you
knew how much it cost.

688
00:57:38,411 --> 00:57:42,075
Um... So I ran the ration
card you gave me.

689
00:57:42,077 --> 00:57:43,909
And according to our records

690
00:57:43,911 --> 00:57:45,975
Amanda Douglas died
nine years ago.

691
00:57:45,977 --> 00:57:47,877
The coroner's report?

692
00:57:47,879 --> 00:57:50,343
Oh, uh, no sir.
It was a famine year.

693
00:57:50,345 --> 00:57:52,275
Mass burials were
quite common.

694
00:57:52,277 --> 00:57:54,243
Many deaths weren't
reported at all.

695
00:57:54,245 --> 00:57:56,143
Well, she's alive, Porter.
We know it.

696
00:57:56,145 --> 00:57:58,777
Amanda Douglas assumed the
identity of Rachel Weller,

697
00:57:58,779 --> 00:58:03,176
who I'm guessing is just
lying in a mass grave somewhere.

698
00:58:03,178 --> 00:58:06,810
Hm. But why assume the identity
of a dead woman?

699
00:58:06,812 --> 00:58:08,746
I don't know, Porter.

700
00:58:13,811 --> 00:58:16,009
You should come in for a swim.

701
00:58:16,011 --> 00:58:18,175
[laughs]

702
00:58:18,177 --> 00:58:20,309
[splashing]

703
00:58:20,311 --> 00:58:24,809
No sir, I'll, I'll...
Afraid I'll drown, sir.

704
00:58:24,811 --> 00:58:29,644
It's a very real possibility.

705
00:58:29,646 --> 00:58:33,242
This is a lost art, Porter.

706
00:58:33,244 --> 00:58:37,745
The trick is to hold your
breath before you go under.

707
00:58:42,345 --> 00:58:44,745
Mm.

708
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:11,410
How long was I asleep?
[clears throat]

709
00:59:11,412 --> 00:59:13,945
A few hours.

710
00:59:15,978 --> 00:59:18,043
Where are we?

711
00:59:18,045 --> 00:59:22,209
Somewhere west of North Dakota
on what's left of the I-94.

712
00:59:22,211 --> 00:59:24,010
[Lucas muttering]

713
00:59:24,012 --> 00:59:25,946
He talks in his sleep.

714
00:59:30,212 --> 00:59:34,242
When he twitches like that,
it means he's dreaming.

715
00:59:34,244 --> 00:59:36,579
[chuckles]

716
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:44,146
What was his father like?

717
00:59:47,112 --> 00:59:50,310
Um...

718
00:59:50,312 --> 00:59:53,876
he came, he stayed a week,
he left.

719
00:59:53,878 --> 00:59:58,709
He was some city dweller.
Lucas never knew him.

720
00:59:58,711 --> 01:00:03,210
But lately he's been
asking a lot of questions.

721
01:00:03,212 --> 01:00:05,808
What do you tell him?

722
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:08,777
I make things up.

723
01:00:08,779 --> 01:00:12,342
Fill in the blanks, and...

724
01:00:12,344 --> 01:00:15,676
I mean he wants to hear that
he's a knight in shining armor.

725
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:18,011
[scoffs]

726
01:00:20,311 --> 01:00:25,309
What about you?
What's your story?

727
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:29,142
I assume you have one.
I mean we all do.

728
01:00:29,144 --> 01:00:31,809
My mother died when I was 12.

729
01:00:31,811 --> 01:00:33,842
I was shipped off
to a state orphanage.

730
01:00:33,844 --> 01:00:36,010
Wasn't a very nice place.

731
01:00:36,012 --> 01:00:38,842
I don't remember my father.

732
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:42,343
There was a man,
friend of my mother's,

733
01:00:42,345 --> 01:00:45,146
taught me how to fish.

734
01:00:54,777 --> 01:00:58,111
I wonder what the world's
gonna be like when he grows up.

735
01:01:00,777 --> 01:01:04,276
If he makes it that far.

736
01:01:04,278 --> 01:01:08,580
When I was a boy, I couldn't
wait for summer vacation.

Hello, Rachel.

Father unknown.

742
01:01:55,678 --> 01:01:58,711
In lieu of kin, Amanda Douglas.

743
01:01:59,845 --> 01:02:03,644
Relationship, neighbour.

744
01:02:03,646 --> 01:02:07,245
Your imposter's your neighbour.
Convenient.

[drone whirring]

747
01:02:35,344 --> 01:02:38,310
[Noah] I tell you to run,
you run for your life.

748
01:02:38,312 --> 01:02:41,012
You run and you don't look back,
you hear me?

749
01:02:51,711 --> 01:02:53,210
Is it looking for us?

750
01:02:53,212 --> 01:02:55,943
It's military.

751
01:02:55,945 --> 01:02:58,209
I think it's replenishing
its solar cells.

752
01:02:58,211 --> 01:03:01,875
- It can stay up there for days.
- What are we gonna do?

753
01:03:01,877 --> 01:03:04,009
Stay put, that's all
we can do.

754
01:03:04,011 --> 01:03:07,377
If you know a long story, now
would be the time to tell it.

755
01:03:07,379 --> 01:03:10,410
[Lucas] It's circling.
It has teeth. I can see 'em.

756
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:14,346
Yeah, and a 20mm mini gun capable
of firing 40 rounds per second.

757
01:03:17,012 --> 01:03:19,276
- I have to pee.
- Hold it.

758
01:03:19,278 --> 01:03:21,175
I don't think it knows
we're down here.

759
01:03:21,177 --> 01:03:23,211
If it did,
we'd be dead by now.

760
01:03:30,678 --> 01:03:32,242
What have you got?

761
01:03:32,244 --> 01:03:35,342
Um, sir, a military drone has
picked up some movement

762
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:38,843
in a sector that hasn't seen
vehicle traffic in months.

763
01:03:38,845 --> 01:03:40,377
There's something down there.

764
01:03:40,379 --> 01:03:42,709
Zoom in.

765
01:03:42,711 --> 01:03:45,876
Um, we can't, sir.

766
01:03:45,878 --> 01:03:47,909
We're borrowing the feed
from the military

767
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:51,009
so we have no control over
the drone's functions.

768
01:03:51,011 --> 01:03:53,875
Do they not know how
important this is, Porter?

769
01:03:53,877 --> 01:03:56,276
I don't think they care, sir.

770
01:03:56,278 --> 01:03:58,711
It's Kross. He's down there
and I know it.

771
01:04:07,178 --> 01:04:09,109
This car smells.

772
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:10,909
Do you think something
died in here?

773
01:04:10,911 --> 01:04:12,912
[Rachel] It's possible.

774
01:04:21,312 --> 01:04:23,109
What's it doing?

775
01:04:23,111 --> 01:04:25,878
It's just making another
long lazy circle, okay?

776
01:04:29,878 --> 01:04:31,711
Hey, don't.

777
01:04:32,144 --> 01:04:34,076
Stop that, Lucas.

778
01:04:34,078 --> 01:04:35,676
[sighs]

779
01:04:35,678 --> 01:04:38,043
Um, okay.

780
01:04:38,045 --> 01:04:44,142
Once upon a time there was, in
a land far, far, away, a giant.

781
01:04:44,144 --> 01:04:47,076
And this giant...

782
01:04:47,078 --> 01:04:50,343
- Come on! This giant...
- It's a stupid game, Mom!

783
01:04:50,345 --> 01:04:53,242
I'm not a little kid anymore.
I hate giants.

784
01:04:53,244 --> 01:04:56,642
He died of sunstroke, okay?
The only thing worse right now

785
01:04:56,644 --> 01:04:58,776
would be "I spy with
my little eye."

786
01:04:58,778 --> 01:05:01,779
I spy with my little eye
something white.

787
01:05:03,345 --> 01:05:06,142
Do that again and I'll break
your little arm.

788
01:05:06,144 --> 01:05:08,343
Lucas, put that out!

789
01:05:08,345 --> 01:05:11,010
You know what the braves
at the Indian camp told me?

790
01:05:11,012 --> 01:05:13,043
They're not real Indians, Lucas.

791
01:05:13,045 --> 01:05:16,409
- New Eden is a death camp.
- What?

792
01:05:16,411 --> 01:05:20,143
It's where millions of people
are burnt, turned into ash.

793
01:05:20,145 --> 01:05:23,009
That's why they promise
to write, but never do.

794
01:05:23,011 --> 01:05:25,042
Because they don't have
any fingers or arms.

795
01:05:25,044 --> 01:05:26,942
They're burnt to a crisp.

796
01:05:26,944 --> 01:05:29,110
Well that is a horrible
thing to say.

797
01:05:29,112 --> 01:05:31,409
It's true. First they force you
into a gas chamber,

798
01:05:31,411 --> 01:05:34,143
and then they burn you
in an oven.

799
01:05:34,145 --> 01:05:36,709
Happy endings only happen
in storybooks.

800
01:05:36,711 --> 01:05:39,744
The giants always step
on the little people.

801
01:05:43,644 --> 01:05:45,809
[Rachel] Noah.

802
01:05:45,811 --> 01:05:49,979
Noah, look at me.
Tell my son he's mistaken.

803
01:05:55,244 --> 01:05:58,908
- [Noah] What am I looking at?

804
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:01,842
- What is this?
- Crematorium Six.

805
01:06:01,844 --> 01:06:03,611
Enhance.

806
01:06:12,412 --> 01:06:15,911
What have we done?

807
01:06:19,044 --> 01:06:21,312
There isn't enough food
or water.

808
01:06:26,978 --> 01:06:29,578
He's telling the truth.

809
01:06:33,144 --> 01:06:36,678
Mom, look. The drone's gone.

810
01:06:46,811 --> 01:06:49,376
That is a hell of
a secret to keep.

811
01:06:49,378 --> 01:06:52,176
Here's a pamphlet that
explains everything?

812
01:06:52,178 --> 01:06:54,642
- How do you sleep at night?
- I don't sleep.

813
01:06:54,644 --> 01:06:58,175
Why me? Why my son? Why save us?

814
01:06:58,177 --> 01:07:01,345
This is the Rachel Weller
I knew. Who are you?

815
01:07:05,145 --> 01:07:08,042
So you finally came
to look for your son.

816
01:07:08,044 --> 01:07:11,242
What took you so long?

817
01:07:11,244 --> 01:07:13,875
Is he everything you imagined?

818
01:07:13,877 --> 01:07:15,978
Yes.

819
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:24,111
[car running noisily]

820
01:07:44,878 --> 01:07:46,946
Shit.

821
01:07:53,144 --> 01:07:56,375
[cocks gun] Don't worry, kid.
Keep your heads down.

822
01:07:56,377 --> 01:07:58,578
Get down, stay down.

Hey, you got your flashlight?

826
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:47,242
- Yes, Mom. Okay. I gotta go.
- Be careful.

827

Hello?

832
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:45,012
[stammers] I-I said hello.

833
01:09:51,745 --> 01:09:54,342
You let him go in the washroom
on his own?

834
01:09:54,344 --> 01:09:57,274
- You think that's wise.
- It was number two.

835
01:09:57,276 --> 01:10:00,009
He insisted. He's not
a little kid anymore.

836
01:10:00,011 --> 01:10:02,976
All right, well,
she's running hot.

837
01:10:02,978 --> 01:10:05,945
There's gotta be some
water in those toilet tanks.

838
01:10:07,778 --> 01:10:10,312
I'll check on Lucas
while I'm there.

The world can be a very dangerous
place, my little friend.

846
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:47,843
[Noah] Lucas? Lucas?

Run!

851
01:11:09,176 --> 01:11:12,144
- We can't leave without Lucas.
- We're getting him back right now.

Three's a crowd. The sooner
you figure that out,

855
01:11:28,144 --> 01:11:29,943
the better off you're gonna be.

856
01:11:29,945 --> 01:11:32,275
You must think you're tough,
picking on a little kid.

857
01:11:32,277 --> 01:11:34,844
Someone should take a picture.
You could show all your friends.

858
01:11:36,877 --> 01:11:39,210
You little pick pocket!
Where is it?

859
01:11:41,144 --> 01:11:43,579
[laughing] It looks so real.

[clatters]

861
01:11:45,911 --> 01:11:48,042
I'll get it.

862
01:11:48,044 --> 01:11:50,312
Little brat.

863
01:11:57,710 --> 01:11:59,209
What is the plan?

864
01:11:59,211 --> 01:12:01,579
The plan is to get him
through the back door.

865
01:12:06,211 --> 01:12:09,011
- [Noah] Shit!
- [Lucas gasps]

Oh boy, okay.

868
01:12:29,711 --> 01:12:31,409
Um, sir.

869
01:12:31,411 --> 01:12:33,376
What is it?

870
01:12:33,378 --> 01:12:36,045
We found this.

871
01:12:43,911 --> 01:12:46,309
Thank you, Porter.

872
01:12:46,311 --> 01:12:48,211
No problem, sir.

873
01:12:49,011 --> 01:12:51,742
[fire crackling]

874
01:12:51,744 --> 01:12:55,578
These instructions
were printed in 1951.

875
01:13:06,111 --> 01:13:09,975
A rem is a unit of
ionizing radiation.

876
01:13:09,977 --> 01:13:11,942
According to the
government of the day,

877
01:13:11,944 --> 01:13:15,642
exposure should not exceed
5000 millirems per year.

878
01:13:15,644 --> 01:13:18,744
An exposure of 600,000
millirems is fatal.

879
01:13:24,644 --> 01:13:29,809
You know, Rachel and I were...
we were friends.

880
01:13:29,811 --> 01:13:33,976
We lived up the road
from each other.

881
01:13:33,978 --> 01:13:39,141
Lucas was two and Rachel
wanted to sell him.

882
01:13:39,143 --> 01:13:42,210
She wanted to sell
her little boy.

883
01:13:45,276 --> 01:13:47,208
You need to understand
that people

884
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:52,008
were eating their
neighbors then.

885
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:56,044
But, you know, Lucas was...

886
01:13:59,211 --> 01:14:03,779
he was just so beautiful,
I couldn't let that happen.

887
01:14:05,411 --> 01:14:10,643
And... we fought, and...

888
01:14:10,645 --> 01:14:14,579
you know, there was an accident.

889
01:14:26,277 --> 01:14:28,676
Lucas thinks you're his mother.

890
01:14:28,678 --> 01:14:31,111
I am his mother.

891
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:36,842
I am his mother. I love him.
I protect him.

892
01:14:36,844 --> 01:14:40,178
I would, I would do
anything for him.

893
01:14:42,276 --> 01:14:44,676
You know, I worry
every single day

894
01:14:44,678 --> 01:14:47,709
what this world is
gonna do to him.

895
01:14:47,711 --> 01:14:49,642
But what about...

896
01:14:49,644 --> 01:14:52,845
[fire crackling]

897
01:15:01,711 --> 01:15:04,210
Are you gonna tell him
you're his father?

898
01:15:08,044 --> 01:15:10,142
Well, what am I gonna do?

899
01:15:10,144 --> 01:15:13,341
I'm gonna say I'm his dad,
but you're not his real mom.

900
01:15:13,343 --> 01:15:15,808
Or-or we did know each other,

901
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:18,142
but we were just acting
like we didn't?

902
01:15:18,144 --> 01:15:20,845
You think he's ready
for the truth?

[Noah] 2000 millirems.
[Rachel] How bad is that?

909
01:16:28,277 --> 01:16:30,375
It's not good.

910
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:32,342
All right, uh, go back
to the car.

911
01:16:32,344 --> 01:16:34,612
Make sure Lucas doesn't get out.

How you doing back there, champ?

914
01:16:46,877 --> 01:16:49,345
I'll let you know when
my hair falls out.

915
01:16:58,077 --> 01:17:00,907
Tell me about the lake. Tell me
how you learned to fish.

916
01:17:00,909 --> 01:17:03,409
You've heard it a hundred times!

917
01:17:03,411 --> 01:17:06,375
- I wanna hear it again.
- There's nothing left to tell.

918
01:17:06,377 --> 01:17:09,341
Why don't you tell me a story?

919
01:17:09,343 --> 01:17:11,975
I haven't done anything
worth telling.

920
01:17:11,977 --> 01:17:15,209
Will you teach me how to fish?

921
01:17:15,211 --> 01:17:17,978
Let's get there first.

922
01:17:26,678 --> 01:17:29,041
I have a nosebleed.

923
01:17:29,043 --> 01:17:31,210
Oh.

924
01:17:35,378 --> 01:17:37,375
Is my hair falling out?

925
01:17:37,377 --> 01:17:40,907
No, you look as handsome
as ever.

926
01:17:40,909 --> 01:17:44,875
I get nosebleeds sometimes.

927
01:17:44,877 --> 01:17:47,209
He'll be fine.

928
01:17:47,211 --> 01:17:50,345
- You promise?
- Yeah, I promise.

929
01:17:58,210 --> 01:18:00,278
When you're ready, sir.

930
01:18:01,809 --> 01:18:05,775
Kross seems to have adapted well
to life outside the city.

931
01:18:05,777 --> 01:18:09,174
He's running towards his past.

932
01:18:09,176 --> 01:18:12,842
The idea of something better.

933
01:18:12,844 --> 01:18:16,042
It'll lead him nowhere, sir.

934
01:18:16,044 --> 01:18:19,208
Perhaps.

935
01:18:19,210 --> 01:18:25,707
But if we all ran,
who would keep our secret?

936
01:18:25,709 --> 01:18:29,707
Well it's possible some
are too big to keep, sir.

937
01:18:29,709 --> 01:18:33,275
I agree.

938
01:18:33,277 --> 01:18:35,941
You can't kill 7 million people
and get away with it.

939
01:18:35,943 --> 01:18:38,944
Eventually you'll be found out.

940
01:18:42,177 --> 01:18:45,211
We're on the wrong side
of history, Porter.

941
01:19:00,677 --> 01:19:04,278
- Hey, the last page is missing.
- It's in my pocket.

942
01:19:07,277 --> 01:19:09,707
It's got my nuclear
submarine on it.

943
01:19:09,709 --> 01:19:12,210
As soon as I save six bucks,
I can order one.

944
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:19,741
You know this is 80
years old, right?

945
01:19:19,743 --> 01:19:22,944
- I know.
- [laughs] Yeah. Okay.

946
01:19:25,411 --> 01:19:27,644
Thanks.

947
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:32,808
You need some water?

948
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:35,278
Uh, no thanks.

949
01:19:40,843 --> 01:19:44,008
Two millirems. It's standard
background radiation.

950
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:45,942
We can see the cooling towers.

951
01:19:45,944 --> 01:19:48,312
This needle should be posted
to the top of the meter.

952
01:19:57,277 --> 01:19:59,644
You wanna hand me that lantern?

953
01:20:02,244 --> 01:20:04,110
Smart.

954
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:16,208
[clicking slowly]

955
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:18,775
It's two millirems.

956
01:20:18,777 --> 01:20:20,975
We're safe.

957
01:20:20,977 --> 01:20:23,641
Why would they say there's
radiation when there's none?

958
01:20:23,643 --> 01:20:26,175
Mom, why would they
scare us like that?

959
01:20:26,177 --> 01:20:29,409
Because it's easier to
build fear than build a wall.

960
01:20:29,411 --> 01:20:31,907
Let's go.

961
01:20:31,909 --> 01:20:34,210
[car starts]

962
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:57,242
I spy with my little eye
something green.

963
01:20:57,244 --> 01:21:01,178
- A tree.
- I've never seen so many.

964
01:21:02,343 --> 01:21:05,008
Maybe we're dead and
we don't know it.

965
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:07,209
Maybe the afterlife
is stuffed with trees.

966
01:21:07,211 --> 01:21:09,643
[Rachel laughs] Lucas!

967
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:15,141
Uh, what's that
red light mean?

968
01:21:15,143 --> 01:21:17,042
[steam hissing]

969
01:21:17,044 --> 01:21:19,811
Oh, forget it. I think I know.

970
01:21:30,876 --> 01:21:32,875
[vehicle accelerating]

971
01:21:32,877 --> 01:21:35,577
[Noah] Run! Run!

972
01:21:37,043 --> 01:21:39,241
He thinks he's home free.

973
01:21:39,243 --> 01:21:41,110
[gunshots]

974
01:21:43,277 --> 01:21:45,245
That was close.

975
01:21:46,343 --> 01:21:50,009
[Lucas] Help us, please
help us. Come on, please.

976
01:21:50,011 --> 01:21:51,743
What.

977
01:21:58,643 --> 01:22:00,175
[gunshot]

978
01:22:00,177 --> 01:22:02,678
[Adam] I will shoot you
in the back.

979
01:22:07,277 --> 01:22:10,342
[Noah]
You have no jurisdiction here.

980
01:22:10,344 --> 01:22:13,341
You know, this place just
looks more impressive on a map.

981
01:22:13,343 --> 01:22:15,874
It's a nice spot.

982
01:22:15,876 --> 01:22:18,341
How'd you know
there's no radiation?

983
01:22:18,343 --> 01:22:21,742
I didn't.

984
01:22:21,744 --> 01:22:26,974
It takes balls, Noah. This road
leads nowhere. Never did.

985
01:22:26,976 --> 01:22:29,977
Shoulda known that.

986
01:22:33,243 --> 01:22:35,610
I will take that.

987
01:22:38,977 --> 01:22:40,842
All right, look.

988
01:22:40,844 --> 01:22:43,208
Nobody needs to know
what you've done here.

989
01:22:43,210 --> 01:22:45,874
Just return what you've stolen.
We'll redeem your reputation.

990
01:22:45,876 --> 01:22:48,644
You can start over.

991
01:22:55,243 --> 01:22:58,775
You know, unfortunately, I-I...

992
01:22:58,777 --> 01:23:00,774
I only have the one
return ticket.

993
01:23:00,776 --> 01:23:02,977
- [gunshot]
- Mom!

994
01:23:09,143 --> 01:23:13,941
You are not a hero, Noah.
And you never will be.

995
01:23:13,943 --> 01:23:16,974
Give me the memory card.

996
01:23:16,976 --> 01:23:22,075
You want the memory card,
let the boy go free.

997
01:23:22,077 --> 01:23:24,675
Let him go, Adam.

998
01:23:24,677 --> 01:23:27,308
He's a child.

999
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:30,011
This isn't his fight.

1000
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:37,707
He's not a child.
He's a monster.

1001
01:23:37,709 --> 01:23:40,045
And I should take your eye out.

1002
01:23:47,644 --> 01:23:49,975
All right, run.

1003
01:23:49,977 --> 01:23:53,075
Go before I change my mind.
Give me the memory card.

1004
01:23:53,077 --> 01:23:56,041
Go! Get outta here, go!

1005
01:23:56,043 --> 01:23:58,710
- You come...
- Get out, run!

1006
01:24:04,276 --> 01:24:06,075
He doesn't know
you're his father, huh?

1007
01:24:06,077 --> 01:24:08,042
No.

1008
01:24:08,044 --> 01:24:10,245
Probably for the better.

1009
01:24:19,276 --> 01:24:21,910
[breathing hard]

1010
01:24:26,143 --> 01:24:28,344
[buzzing]

1011
01:24:35,976 --> 01:24:37,977
It's empty.

1012
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:41,778
It's blank! It's empty!

1013
01:24:46,309 --> 01:24:49,041
[gunshot]

1014
01:24:49,043 --> 01:24:52,944
[water splashing]

1015
01:24:59,376 --> 01:25:02,577
[gunshot in distance]

1016
01:25:12,211 --> 01:25:14,577
[panting]

1017
01:25:16,276 --> 01:25:18,842
He told you to run.
Do you not listen?

1018
01:25:18,844 --> 01:25:20,407
[Lucas grunting]

1019
01:25:20,409 --> 01:25:22,975
That'll do, that'll do,
that'll do, you little monster.

1020
01:25:22,977 --> 01:25:25,111
[gunshots]

1021
01:25:31,844 --> 01:25:34,311
[cocks gun]

1022
01:25:39,211 --> 01:25:42,208
Yes, I'm certain it's Kross.

1023
01:25:42,210 --> 01:25:44,642
There's trouble.

1024
01:25:44,644 --> 01:25:46,911
[Lucas crying] Mom.

1025
01:25:50,010 --> 01:25:52,177
Mom.
[crying]

1026
01:25:54,910 --> 01:25:57,178
[sniffling]

1027
01:26:03,077 --> 01:26:05,844
You can find me.

1028
01:26:32,777 --> 01:26:34,274
[fire crackling]

1029
01:26:34,276 --> 01:26:38,341
Been waiting almost
a week for Noah.

1030
01:26:38,343 --> 01:26:43,111
And that memory card he gave
Agent Westinghouse was blank.

1031
01:26:49,209 --> 01:26:51,674
[sighs]

1032
01:26:51,676 --> 01:26:54,711
Did Noah give you anything?

1033
01:27:29,776 --> 01:27:34,042
New Eden is a death factory.

1034
01:27:34,044 --> 01:27:38,808
A 20-square-acre gas chamber
containing six crematoriums.

1035
01:27:38,810 --> 01:27:41,173
These are the faces
of the innocent,

1036
01:27:41,175 --> 01:27:44,674
the 7 million victims of
state-sanctioned genocide.

1037
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:46,841
Be scared.

1038
01:27:46,843 --> 01:27:49,240
Be very scared.

1039
01:27:49,242 --> 01:27:52,674
You may be next.

1040
01:27:52,676 --> 01:27:54,941
Let the revolution begin.

1041
01:27:54,943 --> 01:27:57,877
[yelling]

1042
01:28:11,342 --> 01:28:12,941
Where are we going?

1043
01:28:12,943 --> 01:28:15,674
To the city. All of us.

1044
01:28:15,676 --> 01:28:18,340
There's a revolution.
Haven't you heard?

1045
01:28:18,342 --> 01:28:20,209
[laughs]

1046
01:28:21,844 --> 01:28:24,711
[yelling]

1047
01:28:30,110 --> 01:28:32,209
What the hell is going on?

1048
01:28:36,744 --> 01:28:40,045
[rioting]

1049
01:28:56,309 --> 01:28:58,643
Oh, shit.

1050
01:28:59,843 --> 01:29:02,611
[gunshot]

1051
01:29:04,109 --> 01:29:07,044
[sounds of nature]

1052
01:29:12,209 --> 01:29:15,977
[splash]

1053
01:29:23,410 --> 01:29:28,110
[Noah] When I was a boy, I
couldn't wait for summer vacation.

1054
01:29:33,289 --> 01:29:38,289

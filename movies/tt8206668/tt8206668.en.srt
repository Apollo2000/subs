Well, thank you,
thank you all,

2
00:00:44,557 --> 00:00:47,516
parents and town
advocates alike,

3
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:50,933
for joining us on
this very special evening.

4
00:00:52,015 --> 00:00:53,766
We're here tonight to kick off

5
00:00:53,849 --> 00:00:56,557
our most ambitious
school year yet.

6
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,265
We've run the numbers,
and folks,

7
00:01:00,349 --> 00:01:03,599
there's no simpler way
for me to put it.

8
00:01:03,683 --> 00:01:07,057
Our children
are getting smarter.

9
00:01:09,557 --> 00:01:14,516
Harvard, two.
Dartmouth, two.

10
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:16,891
Yale, three.

11
00:01:16,974 --> 00:01:18,849
U Penn, seven.

12
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:21,015
Thank you.

13
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,724
And my fellow trustees

14
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:51,307
who wait all year long

15
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:54,224
ranking the top
public schools in America

16
00:01:54,307 --> 00:01:57,849
based on SATs and college
acceptance rates.

17
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,933
And Roslyn is four...

18
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:08,516
And now, I'd like to bring out
the man responsible.

19
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,974
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

20
00:02:10,057 --> 00:02:11,599
In his ten years here,

21
00:02:11,683 --> 00:02:14,057
he's revamped
our education system.

22
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,641
From pre-K all the way
to high school.

23
00:02:17,265 --> 00:02:20,015
Please join me in welcoming
to the stage

Have we heard about
Mr. Kopple?

32
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:16,891
- Wife had twins.
- Twins!

00:03:16,974 --> 00:03:18,533
- Late last night.
- Nice. Send over flowers

and maybe an edible arrangement.

- Yeah, it'd be even nicer

37
00:03:23,432 --> 00:03:24,575
if they were shaped like ones.

38
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,075
- You know, Dr. Tassone...
- Hey.

39

A wise woman once said
it's not having what you want.

- It's wanting what you got.
- Mrs. Gluckin.

41
00:03:31,182 --> 00:03:33,683
I barely recognize you anymore
what with the new name,

42
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:35,140
new office, new job title.

43
00:03:35,224 --> 00:03:37,474
The same pay, same paperwork.

44
00:03:37,724 --> 00:03:39,224
July and August
are all settled up.

45
00:03:39,307 --> 00:03:41,140
- Expenses booked and archived.
- Perfect.

And something else I wanted
to talk to you about...

47
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:44,224
Safety gates
are all taken care of.

48
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,641
I'm meeting with City Hall
later today to go over strategy.

49
00:03:46,724 --> 00:03:48,057
Jeez, someone's
had their coffee.

50
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,557

- Uh, Dr. Tassone?

- Uh, did you want your flight

to the Vegas conference Friday
out of JFK or Newark?

53

Thanks, J.
Whatever's cheaper works fine.

54

And, uh, Mary Ann,
is there any way

55
00:03:57,224 --> 00:03:58,492
you'd be able to grab
my diet smoothie?

56
00:03:58,516 --> 00:03:59,909
- I was running late.
- Oh, sure.

57

- Uh, but there's
one more thing.
Uh-huh.

58
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,057
Carol Schweitzer's
been camped up

59
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,808
in the conference room
since 6:30.

60
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:06,116
Says it's urgent
she speaks with you.

61
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,891
Okay, okay. Um...

62
00:04:07,974 --> 00:04:09,808
- Chad.
- Chad, Chad Schweitzer's...

63
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:11,307
okay, I'll take care of it.

64
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:13,015
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

65

Stop it.

66
00:04:14,557 --> 00:04:15,683
Do us all a favor.

67
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:18,140
If he's not out of there
in an hour, call 911.

68
00:04:19,974 --> 00:04:21,283
And I am banging down doors

69
00:04:21,307 --> 00:04:22,307
until somebody here

70
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:24,182
takes me seriously.
All right?

71
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:27,265
That Militzok,
she plays favorites, okay?

72
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:29,158
She wouldn't even let him
take a bathroom break

73
00:04:29,182 --> 00:04:32,057
during the test,
and he has
a hyperactive bladder.

74
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,766
Chad, honey, tell him how you...

75
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:35,950
you know what, I have a note
here from his doctor, okay?

76
00:04:35,974 --> 00:04:37,766
Ms. Schweitzer,
just, just calm down.

77
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:40,099
- Let's, let's just...
- No one will listen to me.

78
00:04:40,182 --> 00:04:41,950
All right, I don't know
what else I'm supposed to do.

79
00:04:41,974 --> 00:04:44,808
Chad, he is just as gifted
as everyone else in his year.

80
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:46,474
- Absolutely.
- And...

81
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:48,224
I'm scared, Dr. Tassone,

82
00:04:48,307 --> 00:04:50,641
because if he
doesn't get into OMNI...

83
00:04:52,015 --> 00:04:53,935
and he starts to think
of himself as less than...

84
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:55,391
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

85
00:04:55,724 --> 00:04:57,099
No, I will talk
to Ms. Militzok.

86
00:04:57,182 --> 00:04:59,182
I will straighten
this whole thing out.

87
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,474
- You will?
- Yes.

88
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:02,849
And, and we'll just set
a make-up test for Chad.

89
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:04,641
All right, with ample
bathroom time.

90
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:06,140
Thank you, Dr. Tassone.

91
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:07,944
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate that.

92
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,367
There's no need to thank me,
all right?

93
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:11,307
Chad's a smart kid with
the world ahead of him,

94
00:05:11,391 --> 00:05:13,224
and it's our job
to give him the runway.

97
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,182
You know, Chad,
when I was your age,

98
00:05:24,683 --> 00:05:26,808
I didn't even place
into fast track math.

99
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:27,808
- Really?
- No.

100
00:05:27,891 --> 00:05:29,307
I couldn't nail my times tables.

101
00:05:29,391 --> 00:05:32,557
And at the time,
I thought my world was ending.

102
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:35,724
But I caught up.
You know what?

103
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:39,265

Um...

00:06:54,683 --> 00:06:57,140
okay, so they just,
they want me
to write an article

about the SkyWalk proposal
in the new budget.

Um...

We've been asking high schoolers

how we can make
their day easier,

131

so we came up with this idea,
the SkyWalk.

132
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:20,015
Um, a bridge,
to link the school
from end to end.

00:07:20,683 --> 00:07:23,974
And um, it's a
huge undertaking for us.

And we can't wait

are approved next May.

No, it's just a puff piece.

- Hi. Oh, you're, uh...
- Hey.

Nice to meet you, Rachel.
And if you want to

153
00:08:15,015 --> 00:08:17,391
follow up, just set a time
with Mary Ann, okay?

154
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:21,557
And, uh, I'll be keeping
an eye out for your byline.

155
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:27,307
The demand is insane.
It's skyrocketing.

156
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,909

00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:33,140
in Syosset or Jericho.

159
00:08:33,224 --> 00:08:35,367
Right, but those towns are
a further commute from the city.

160
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,808
Not Manhasset, not Great Neck.

161
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,099
It's the public schools.
The better the school system,

162
00:08:39,182 --> 00:08:40,982
the higher the price tag
on the homes, period.

163
00:08:41,015 --> 00:08:43,557
Our firm has sold nine
separate lots in that area

164
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:45,158
since the report in
that journal came out.

165
00:08:45,182 --> 00:08:46,766
And, uh,
here's a little something

166
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:49,224
- you know, from all of us.
- Okay.

167
00:08:50,057 --> 00:08:53,265
Oh, wow.
Really, that's, oh, wow.

168
00:08:53,891 --> 00:08:55,851
- Keep up the good work.
- Well, thanks, everyone.

169
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:57,307
- Dr. Tassone?
- Oh, yeah.

170
00:08:57,391 --> 00:08:58,700
- Do you mind
if we get a little...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

171
00:08:58,724 --> 00:09:00,140
- Something for my office.
- Great.

172
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:01,950
- I really appreciate you...
- Scoot in, scoot in, Will.

173
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,849
- Coming in today.
- Mm-hmm.

174
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:05,057
Thank you, okay.

175
00:09:06,349 --> 00:09:07,391
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay.

176
00:09:07,474 --> 00:09:08,700
- All right?
- Yeah, let's let him...

177
00:09:08,724 --> 00:09:09,867
- Let him get back to work.
- Thank you.

178
00:09:09,891 --> 00:09:11,200
- No, I really appreciate it.
- Yeah.

179
00:09:11,224 --> 00:09:12,933
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

180
00:09:13,015 --> 00:09:14,557
Okay.

181
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,974
I can't eat these.
Just, if you put them out

182
00:09:20,057 --> 00:09:22,182
for everybody to pick at,
that'd be great.

183
00:09:23,766 --> 00:09:25,307
They were out of the flax seed.

184
00:09:27,057 --> 00:09:29,140
That's okay, that's okay.
Thanks.

185
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,641
How much do you
figure a guy like Bob

186
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:36,140
makes at his regular job?

187
00:09:36,474 --> 00:09:38,265
- Bob Spicer, you mean?
- Mm-hmm.

188
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:39,974
Oh...

189
00:09:40,516 --> 00:09:42,307
high sixes a year, minimum.

190
00:09:42,724 --> 00:09:44,224
Maybe seven figures
in this market.

191
00:09:44,307 --> 00:09:46,516
- Why?
- Oh, forget it.

192
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:51,599
You look tired.

193
00:09:52,974 --> 00:09:54,694
You might wanna
go home early,
get some rest.

194
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:56,140
I gotta run Dickens.

195
00:09:56,474 --> 00:09:57,891
Maybe I'll try and bow out and

196
00:09:57,974 --> 00:09:59,784
get a headstart
and early prep for
Vegas this weekend.

197
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,599
- I wouldn't bail on book club.
- Why?

198
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:02,683
Those women adore you,

199
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:04,557
and each one talks
to two dozen more.

200
00:10:05,057 --> 00:10:07,057
The next budget vote's
only nine months away.

201
00:10:07,349 --> 00:10:09,599
- Right, our SkyWalk.
- Yeah, the SkyWalk is big.

202
00:10:09,683 --> 00:10:11,683
Gets us to first.
That's all that matters.

203
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,015
This new diet is kicking my ass.

204
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:19,224
What is that, even?

205
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:21,492
It's got charcoal in it
or something like that.

206
00:10:21,516 --> 00:10:22,516
Yeah, coal.

207
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:25,474
I would kill somebody
for a carb right now.

208
00:10:26,265 --> 00:10:27,891
I don't know
where you could find one.

209
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:29,974
You are such a bitch.

210
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:32,391
Oh, would you like a bite?

211
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:35,033
- I hate pastrami on rye.
- You want a bite.

212
00:10:35,057 --> 00:10:36,659
- I hate pastrami on rye.
- Yeah, I know you hate it.

213
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:38,432
Open up.

214
00:10:38,516 --> 00:10:40,516
- Fucking so good.
- Right?

215
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:41,849
Come on, you can eat more.

216
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,974
You got... come on,
one more bite.

217
00:10:44,057 --> 00:10:45,367
- I will kill you.
- I won't tell anyone.

218
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:46,432
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

219
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:49,349
You're a growing boy.

220
00:10:49,432 --> 00:10:52,099
Come on.
Eat the fuckin' sandwich.

221
00:10:52,182 --> 00:10:55,265
♪ ♪

222
00:11:06,724 --> 00:11:07,724
Let's get started.

223
00:11:07,808 --> 00:11:09,265
Should we get started, everyone?

224
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:12,432
Uh, what do we all think
of "Martin Chuzzlewit"?

225
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:20,182
Okay.
Um...

226
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:24,265
You know, Frank, the culture
is not for everyone.

227
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:25,669
Eh, I thought we
wound up having a

228
00:11:25,724 --> 00:11:27,766
really good
discussion, ultimately.

229
00:11:31,182 --> 00:11:32,307
Um...

230
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:37,432
Frank, can I ask you
a personal question?

231
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,307
Sure.

232
00:11:39,974 --> 00:11:41,599
It's just that...

233
00:11:42,182 --> 00:11:43,307
Jonah's...

234
00:11:43,724 --> 00:11:46,641
you know, having a really
hard time with the separation.

235
00:11:46,724 --> 00:11:48,391
Yeah.
You know, Ms. Schlacter,

236
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:51,766
uh, told me that he's opened up
a little bit in Banana Splits?

237
00:11:53,307 --> 00:11:55,391
- Right, yeah, oh, my God.
- Yeah.

238
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:58,474
- Thank you for getting him in.
- No, of course.

239
00:11:59,557 --> 00:12:01,891
It has been
so hard on us, and...

240
00:12:02,224 --> 00:12:03,766
- Yeah.
- You have been...

241
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,224
such a tremendous help.

242
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:09,766
Oh, Sharon, of course.
Anytime, anytime.

243
00:12:10,891 --> 00:12:12,349
Yeah, and...

244
00:12:13,474 --> 00:12:14,474
Um...

245
00:12:18,182 --> 00:12:20,432
- Frank, I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, no, no.

246
00:12:20,516 --> 00:12:21,700
You want what's best
for your son.

247
00:12:21,724 --> 00:12:23,057
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

248
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,265
Uh, no, it makes you strong.
It's, um...

249
00:12:26,974 --> 00:12:28,140
I...

250
00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:30,349
you know, I think
at the end of the day,

251
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:32,641
her memory is still very fresh.

252
00:12:38,849 --> 00:12:40,808
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.

253
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:47,599
Somehow, I'm not surprised.

254
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,474
Jenny screwed up
some paperwork earlier.

255
00:12:49,557 --> 00:12:50,891
I'm saving her ass.

256
00:12:50,974 --> 00:12:52,557
Jenny's got a good aunt.

257
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:54,557
How did Dickens go?

258
00:12:56,432 --> 00:12:58,974
Well, it was Sharon Katz's
place this week.

259
00:13:00,766 --> 00:13:02,307
And...

260
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:07,140
- I knew it.
- I, I think maybe

261
00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:08,933
I shouldn't have offered
to wash up.

262
00:13:09,015 --> 00:13:10,849
That poor woman.

263
00:13:11,683 --> 00:13:13,140
She's nowhere near your type.

264
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:15,099
She's not, she's not.

265
00:13:17,224 --> 00:13:19,099
- Jamieson.
- Uh, Honors English.

266
00:13:19,182 --> 00:13:20,933
- Loves Nietzsche.
- Very good.

267
00:13:21,015 --> 00:13:22,724
- Yep.
- Uh, DiGennaro?

268
00:13:23,474 --> 00:13:25,766
Oh, DiGennaro.
Uh...

269
00:13:25,849 --> 00:13:27,766
Social studies,

270
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,766
- ninth grade global hist...
- Ah!

271
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:32,140
- Oh, American history.
- Uh-huh.

272
00:13:32,224 --> 00:13:35,015
Uh, coaches Little League, too.

273
00:13:35,099 --> 00:13:36,307
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

274
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:38,200
Well, these are too easy.
Oh, here's a toughie.

275
00:13:38,224 --> 00:13:39,557
Uh-huh.

276
00:13:41,057 --> 00:13:42,057
Todhunter.

277
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:43,724
Oh, shit.

278
00:13:46,724 --> 00:13:49,265
Todhunter, Todhunter...

279
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:53,891
Mr. Todhunter.

280
00:13:53,974 --> 00:13:56,057
How's that bowling league
shaping up this season?

281
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,057
Oh, uh, we're ahead.

282
00:13:58,891 --> 00:14:01,099
But we've got our big match
against Jericho on Sunday.

283
00:14:01,182 --> 00:14:03,724
Jericho, mm.
I think you'll crush them.

284
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:05,140
Thank you for putting this on.

285
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:06,575
-This is so nice.
-Oh, of course.
My pleasure.

286
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:07,825
- Oh, Frank!
- The least I could do.

287
00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:09,289
- Yeah, excuse me.
- Hey, Frank.

288
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,474
- Hey.
- So, um...

289
00:14:11,557 --> 00:14:13,432
hey, are you getting
pumped for Vegas?

290
00:14:13,516 --> 00:14:15,015
'Cause, uh,
I got my bags packed.

291
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:16,224
- I'm ready to go.
- Yeah.

292
00:14:16,307 --> 00:14:17,533
It'll be good to get away
from the wife

293
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:18,724
for a few days too, huh?

294
00:14:18,808 --> 00:14:20,182
- Right?
- Right.

295
00:14:21,516 --> 00:14:23,933
A few days, yeah.

296
00:14:24,015 --> 00:14:26,224
You want to know how many bids
we got from contractors?

297
00:14:26,307 --> 00:14:28,516
Mm-hmm, for
the SkyWalk construction.

298
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:30,599
You explored several options,
right?

299
00:14:31,432 --> 00:14:34,599
- I think we had four or five.
- Okay.

300
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:36,557
From which firms, exactly?

301
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:38,161
Hang-hang on a sec.
What's this article

302
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:39,599
you're supposed to be writing?

303
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:42,808
Oh, it's a piece on the SkyWalk.

304
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,516
And the student paper
wanted a deep dive

305
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:47,099
into construction specs?

306
00:14:47,182 --> 00:14:49,766
They're giving me free reign,
more or less.

307
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:52,307
I guess I'm just looking
for an interesting way in.

308
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,516
- Oh, okay, Ruth.
- Rachel.

309
00:14:54,724 --> 00:14:57,516
Rachel, so let me give you
a great angle for your story.

310
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:59,057
- Okay.
- You wanna write this down

311
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,557
- or are you...
- I'm taping.

312
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:02,015
Oh.

313
00:15:02,891 --> 00:15:04,015
Okay.

314
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,349
The SkyWalk is a great project.

315
00:15:07,432 --> 00:15:10,099

00:25:37,766 --> 00:25:38,849
Sure.

476
00:25:38,933 --> 00:25:40,766
All right, Jen.
What's going on?

477
00:25:41,182 --> 00:25:43,641
Uh, honestly...

478
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:47,599
I feel bad even
bringing it up, but, um...

479
00:25:48,182 --> 00:25:50,307
- Jake's birthday is comin' up.
- Oh!

480
00:25:50,391 --> 00:25:53,849
And he's been asking for
the Sony PlayStation.

481
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:55,391
- Video game system.
- Yeah.

482
00:25:55,474 --> 00:25:59,057
And how all his friends have it
and how he feels left out.

483
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,140
- Aw.
- You know, um,

484
00:26:01,224 --> 00:26:04,516
money's been tight,
and I was just thinking since

485
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:07,391
Howard's been doin'
so well and all...

486
00:26:19,974 --> 00:26:22,099
I'd pay you back
as soon as I'm able.

487
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,808
Just put it on the card.

488
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:30,724
Amber, sweetie, do you mind

489
00:26:30,808 --> 00:26:32,641
giving your cousin Jenny
and me a minute?

490
00:26:35,557 --> 00:26:36,808
Thank you.

491
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:40,182
But I was wondering
if maybe you could
just lend me

492
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,505
the money from your personal...

493
00:26:41,557 --> 00:26:43,116
Don't worry about it.
It'll all be reconciled

494
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,057
at the end of the month.

495
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,683
I've been doing this
a long time.

496
00:26:47,057 --> 00:26:48,224
It's, it's just,

497
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:50,099
he wants that PlayStation
so much, you know?

498
00:26:50,182 --> 00:26:52,158
Just put the receipt on my desk
first thing Monday morning

499
00:26:52,182 --> 00:26:53,891
and don't give it
another thought.

500
00:26:54,182 --> 00:26:57,349
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to play host.

501
00:27:06,349 --> 00:27:07,891
I don't get this.
What is this?

502
00:27:08,766 --> 00:27:10,349
It's the SkyWalk piece
you wanted.

503
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:14,307
No, this is two pages
of contractor bids,

504
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:16,265
building materials,
and zoning ordinances

505
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:17,808
in brutal detail.

506
00:27:17,891 --> 00:27:19,349
Yeah, it's journalism.

507
00:27:19,432 --> 00:27:20,599
Our readers are 15.

508
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:24,140
You realize we have to submit
every issue to Bressler

509
00:27:24,224 --> 00:27:25,432
before we go to print.

510
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:28,307
And Dr. Tassone,
and Pam Cremona.

511
00:27:28,391 --> 00:27:30,307
Pam Gluckin.
It's Gluckin now.

512
00:27:30,391 --> 00:27:33,391
Look, we're not
the "New York Times," right?

513
00:27:33,474 --> 00:27:35,808
We're an extracurricular.
We are a club

514
00:27:35,891 --> 00:27:37,808
designed to get us all
into good colleges.

515
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:40,808
We have a certain
finesse to the way
we approach stories here.

516
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:42,808
A je ne sais quoi, if you will.

517
00:27:43,224 --> 00:27:46,224
But don't worry, though.
You're gonna get the hang of it.

Sir.

522
00:29:21,391 --> 00:29:22,808
Could I ask, uh,

523
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:24,933
how many of our stores
have you visited today?

524
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:26,474
Uh...

525
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,182
a couple.

526
00:29:28,265 --> 00:29:29,683
The ones in Farmingdale
and Islip

527
00:29:29,766 --> 00:29:31,116
didn't have what
I was looking for.

528
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,849
I mean, you know,
we actually offer

529
00:29:32,933 --> 00:29:36,015
free ship-to service for
our high-value customers.

530
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:41,849
You think I'm high-value?

531
00:29:42,557 --> 00:29:45,015
I mean, reasonably, yeah.

532
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:48,849
So where's this stuff going?

533
00:29:51,349 --> 00:29:52,989
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah, no, no.

534
00:29:53,015 --> 00:29:54,784
- I'll get him.
No, he's right here.
Motherfucking shit.

535
00:29:54,808 --> 00:29:55,974
No, he's... no worries.

536
00:29:56,057 --> 00:29:57,492
Honey, come on,
you know how they feel

537
00:29:57,516 --> 00:29:59,283
- about the phones on the course.
- It's Larry, for you.

538
00:29:59,307 --> 00:30:01,182
- My cousin.
- Larry, for me?

539
00:30:01,265 --> 00:30:02,474
- Mm.
- What?

540
00:30:02,557 --> 00:30:04,349
Okay, just tell him
I'll call him after 18.

541
00:30:04,432 --> 00:30:06,140
He says it's about the school.

542
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:10,140
Larry from...
the mattress firm?

543
00:30:10,224 --> 00:30:12,182
No, he's over
at Ace Hardware now.

544
00:30:12,724 --> 00:30:15,599
So this kid, he gives
my guy a home address.

545
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,099
In Westhampton.

546
00:30:17,474 --> 00:30:19,891
Full 50 miles outside of Roslyn.

547
00:30:20,224 --> 00:30:21,766
And it's a home address.

548
00:30:22,891 --> 00:30:25,099
You know?
So I say to myself, I say,

549
00:30:25,182 --> 00:30:26,808
"What's a Roslyn
school's contractor

550
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:27,974
"doing buying supplies

551
00:30:28,057 --> 00:30:29,641
all the way out
in Selden for, anyway?"

552
00:30:29,724 --> 00:30:30,825
No, we wouldn't, we wouldn't.

553
00:30:30,849 --> 00:30:32,432
We get our materials
wholesale, anyway.

554
00:30:32,516 --> 00:30:33,974
We, we put out bids.

555
00:30:34,557 --> 00:30:37,641
Tool chest, shower heads.
That's home improvement.

556
00:30:37,724 --> 00:30:39,408
- That's not school stuff.
- That's right, right.

557
00:30:39,432 --> 00:30:41,200
- It doesn't add up, Bob.
- Who is this James McCarden

558
00:30:41,224 --> 00:30:42,742
and why does he have
a Roslyn expense card?

559
00:30:42,766 --> 00:30:44,200
I don't know.
I don't even know a McCarden.

560
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,683
There is no McCarden at Roslyn.

561
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:48,474
Oh, hang on, honey,
wasn't Pam Cremona

562
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:49,808
or Gluckin or whatever she is,

563
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:51,641
wasn't her first husband
a McCarden?

564
00:30:52,974 --> 00:30:53,974
Come on.

565
00:30:54,057 --> 00:30:56,265
No way.
Pam Gluckin, of all people?

566
00:30:56,349 --> 00:30:58,557
She's gonna have a house
on Dune Road?

567
00:31:11,516 --> 00:31:13,408
What should we say?
No, there's
nothing to say.

568
00:31:13,432 --> 00:31:15,033
The receipts
say everything.
Yeah, okay.

569
00:31:15,057 --> 00:31:17,891
- But we need to...
- Okay, she's right behind you.

570
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:22,099
Hi, Pam.

571
00:31:22,432 --> 00:31:24,516
And, uh,
I want to thank you all

572
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,950
for volunteering time
out of your day

573
00:31:25,974 --> 00:31:27,724
to speak with me.
I would just

574
00:31:27,808 --> 00:31:29,158
love to hear from each
of you what you hope

575
00:31:29,182 --> 00:31:30,974
to achieve in the sixth grade.

576
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:33,224
Yeah, let's start
with you, Heather.

577
00:31:33,307 --> 00:31:34,724
I wanna get all A's and become

578
00:31:34,808 --> 00:31:37,140
a cardiothoracic surgeon
like my mom.

579
00:31:40,808 --> 00:31:42,349
Great, uh,

580
00:31:42,432 --> 00:31:44,224
but just for the purposes
of today...

581
00:31:44,307 --> 00:31:45,849
if you could just...

582
00:31:46,891 --> 00:31:48,057
- Come.
- What?

583
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,849
- Quick.
- Uh...

584
00:31:52,974 --> 00:31:55,307
One second.
Okay, I'll be back.

585
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,265
♪ ♪

586
00:32:26,349 --> 00:32:27,724
We're vulnerable here.

587
00:32:27,808 --> 00:32:29,599
She stole $30,000
in taxpayer money

588
00:32:29,683 --> 00:32:31,432
and that's just between
the Ace Hardware.

589
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:32,991
Who knows who else
got an expense card?

590
00:32:33,015 --> 00:32:35,099
I'm telling you,
it's our moral responsibility

591
00:32:35,182 --> 00:32:36,933
to report this to the town.
We have to.

592
00:32:37,015 --> 00:32:38,432
No, this is a criminal matter.

593
00:32:38,516 --> 00:32:39,825
We've got to call the police,
the FBI.

594
00:32:39,849 --> 00:32:41,849
Okay, that was
our legal counsel.

595
00:32:42,182 --> 00:32:43,599
They do recommend we report.

596
00:32:43,683 --> 00:32:46,057
Great, okay, well then,
that settles it.

597
00:32:46,391 --> 00:32:48,224
I'm gonna call the mayor.

598
00:32:48,307 --> 00:32:49,724
Frank, you wanna be
on that call?

599
00:32:51,057 --> 00:32:52,182
Um...

600
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:55,265
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

601
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:56,700
Go get him,
get him a glass of water.

602
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:57,950
I should have caught this.
I should have checked.

603
00:32:57,974 --> 00:32:59,724
Pam's been here
longer than I have.

604
00:32:59,808 --> 00:33:01,057
I didn't even think.

605
00:33:01,724 --> 00:33:03,891
No, no, no, no, Frank.
It's... it's not your fault.

606
00:33:04,224 --> 00:33:08,140
She built up a decade's worth
of trust with all of us.

607
00:33:08,516 --> 00:33:10,099
We were asleep at the wheel.

608
00:33:10,974 --> 00:33:13,391
Thank you.

609
00:33:15,057 --> 00:33:16,933
But before we go any further,
we need to,

610
00:33:17,015 --> 00:33:18,450
we need to know
what we're dealing with.

611
00:33:18,474 --> 00:33:20,516
I have Phil in my office
getting a firm number.

612
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:21,974
Phil, our auditor?

613
00:33:22,057 --> 00:33:23,432
The man should be fired.

614
00:33:23,516 --> 00:33:25,808
He's the one person who should
have caught wind of this.

615
00:33:25,891 --> 00:33:27,057
- Prick.
- Okay.

616
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,516
We can't jump the gun here.

617
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:31,432
Not when there's this much
at stake, all right?

618
00:33:33,307 --> 00:33:34,808
- Can we...
- Okay.

619
00:33:34,891 --> 00:33:36,057
We'll give him an hour.

620
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:38,683
- That's...
But then, after that...
- Right.

621
00:33:39,265 --> 00:33:41,140
- We start making calls.
- Right.

622
00:33:42,432 --> 00:33:44,182
How could Jim Boy
be so careless,

623
00:33:44,265 --> 00:33:45,724
going around like that?

624
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:49,265
I'm pulling him
off the remodel,
that's for sure.

625
00:33:49,557 --> 00:33:51,891
Just gonna have to hire on
a real contractor.

626
00:33:51,974 --> 00:33:54,099
- A professional.
- Yeah, Pam?

627
00:33:54,182 --> 00:33:56,015
No, no, no.
Frank's gonna fix this.

628
00:33:56,391 --> 00:33:57,991
He knows how important
I am to this school.

629
00:33:58,015 --> 00:34:00,099
I'm the one who keeps
the lights on here, you know?

630
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:02,265
- He'll tell 'em.
- Do you think anybody

631
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:04,766
could ever find out
about the PlayStation?

632
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:07,641
No, I told you
I took care of that.

633
00:34:07,724 --> 00:34:09,432
You have nothing
to worry about there.

634
00:34:10,432 --> 00:34:11,599
That's good.

635
00:34:13,265 --> 00:34:14,599
It's just, um...

636
00:34:15,557 --> 00:34:16,599
I, uh...

637
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,099
I might have also done a little
early Christmas shopping

638
00:34:20,182 --> 00:34:21,724
over the weekend, too.

639
00:34:22,474 --> 00:34:24,367
See, I wasn't gonna mention
until after the holiday

640
00:34:24,391 --> 00:34:25,933
because I bought you something,

641
00:34:26,015 --> 00:34:27,683
and I didn't,
I didn't wanna spoil it.

642
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:31,140
I swear, I swear,
I was gonna reimburse it all.

643
00:34:31,974 --> 00:34:32,974
How much?

644
00:34:33,057 --> 00:34:35,099
Not much, you know.
Just like, um...

645
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,224
maybe...

646
00:34:37,307 --> 00:34:39,766
$1,600 at Lord & Taylor and...

647
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:41,766
another 12 at Macy's.

648
00:34:50,516 --> 00:34:51,974
Frank's gonna fix this.

649
00:34:54,516 --> 00:34:56,057
Give me good news, Phil.

650
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,140
There's no way.
There's, there's no way.

651
00:34:58,224 --> 00:34:59,617
There's check warrants
that are missing.

652
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:02,182
Purchase orders.
I took her word for it.

653
00:35:02,265 --> 00:35:04,683
She would tell me one thing,
she'd say don't worry about it,

654
00:35:04,766 --> 00:35:08,057
and I believed her like the
fucking idiot schmuck I am.

655
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:12,349
Oh, I never even think
to check up, to validate.

656
00:35:12,557 --> 00:35:15,015
I'm gonna lose my job.
I'm gonna lose our firm.

657
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:16,700
- We're dead, they'll kill us.
- Hey, hey, no, no, no...

658
00:35:16,724 --> 00:35:19,307
Nobody's killing anybody.
Phil, look me in the eye.

659
00:35:19,391 --> 00:35:20,974
Look me in the eye.

660
00:35:24,057 --> 00:35:26,557
You're running the show here.
Say it after me.

661
00:35:26,641 --> 00:35:28,391
"I am running the show."

662
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:33,140
- I am running the show.
- Good.

663
00:35:34,557 --> 00:35:35,432
Pull it together.

664
00:35:35,516 --> 00:35:37,307
How much did
you find concretely?

665
00:35:39,015 --> 00:35:40,307
Uh...

666
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:43,599
Two hundred twenty-three.

667
00:35:44,057 --> 00:35:45,857
Concretely, but that's
just the obvious stuff.

668
00:35:45,933 --> 00:35:48,224
- Who knows what else is buried...
- $223,000.

669
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:53,391
Okay, okay.

670
00:35:56,307 --> 00:35:57,724
That's our number.

671
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:00,033
- What are you talking about?
- That's the number

672
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:01,599
we go back
to the board with, 223.

673
00:36:01,683 --> 00:36:03,057
No, you're not hearing me.

674
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,533
That might just be
the tip of the iceberg.

675
00:36:04,557 --> 00:36:06,099
- Well, you don't know that.
- Frank.

676
00:36:06,391 --> 00:36:08,140
The receipts are gone.

677
00:36:08,224 --> 00:36:09,784
They're in the bin
of a shredder, probably.

678
00:36:09,808 --> 00:36:11,224
She could have misplaced them.

679
00:36:11,307 --> 00:36:12,659
I mean, there's a very
real scenario here

680
00:36:12,683 --> 00:36:14,849
where all the other expenses
are legit, right?

681
00:36:15,432 --> 00:36:17,474
- Maybe, I don't know.
- Okay, Phil, Phil.

682
00:36:17,557 --> 00:36:19,391
She's not some
criminal mastermind.

683
00:36:19,474 --> 00:36:20,724
All right, Pam is our friend,

684
00:36:20,808 --> 00:36:23,057
and she has made
a stupid mistake.

685
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,307
But what...

686
00:36:27,391 --> 00:36:29,808
but what about
the state comptroller?

687
00:36:30,891 --> 00:36:32,349
Hevesi could barge
into this office

688
00:36:32,432 --> 00:36:34,557
at any given moment,
conduct an outside audit.

689
00:36:34,641 --> 00:36:37,641
Has he ever done that once
in your 30 years of experience?

690
00:36:39,724 --> 00:36:40,808
Exactly.

691
00:36:40,891 --> 00:36:42,391
Just...

692
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:45,474
give me a number, and...

693
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:48,557
I'll take care of the board.

694
00:36:52,516 --> 00:36:55,891
♪ ♪

695
00:37:14,307 --> 00:37:16,974
Okay, okay, everyone.

696
00:37:17,057 --> 00:37:18,933
So, the, uh...

697
00:37:20,307 --> 00:37:22,265
the sum total is $250,000.

698
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:23,749
- What?
- Jesus, are you kidding me?

699
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,033
- That woman
has a set of balls on her.
- We can just...

700
00:37:27,057 --> 00:37:28,784
- When I get my chance.
- You never will.

701
00:37:28,808 --> 00:37:30,724
She's gonna be Nassau PD's
for the taking.

702
00:37:30,808 --> 00:37:32,450
- And that shitbird son of hers.
- No, no, no, no, no.

703
00:37:32,474 --> 00:37:34,116
- No, no, no, Bob.
- Okay, all right,
let's do this right.

704
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,140
- Put the phone away, Bob.
- And why should he?

705
00:37:36,224 --> 00:37:38,849
Because we will lose everything.

706
00:37:43,432 --> 00:37:44,557
What do you mean, Frank?

707
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:46,182
Once word gets out about Pam,

708
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:48,641
we're inviting
"The Times," "Newsday,"

709
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,766
and every other paper
in the tri-state area

710
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:52,325
- to our front door.
- With all due respect,

711
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:54,683
screw the papers.
This is a very real crime here.

712
00:37:54,766 --> 00:37:56,140
A theft of taxpayer money.

713
00:37:56,224 --> 00:37:57,575
Judy, you've served
on the school board

714
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,766
for how long, seven years?

715
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:00,641
- Eight, proudly,
- Okay, and in eight years,

716
00:38:00,724 --> 00:38:02,599
how many times
has our budget been passed

717
00:38:02,683 --> 00:38:04,265
by taxpayers without incident?

718
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:05,641
- Eight.
- Right.

719
00:38:05,724 --> 00:38:07,325
So what happens
when our next budget goes up

720
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:08,599
for approval in May?

721
00:38:08,683 --> 00:38:10,391
The budget that
we've worked all year on.

722
00:38:10,474 --> 00:38:12,349
The stimulus that
gets us the SkyWalk.

723
00:38:12,432 --> 00:38:14,766
That gets us to first.
What happens?

724
00:38:15,015 --> 00:38:16,391
I get what he's saying.

725
00:38:16,474 --> 00:38:18,265
I mean, how's it going to look?

726
00:38:18,683 --> 00:38:20,808
A school employee
is able to take

727
00:38:20,891 --> 00:38:23,099
hundreds of thousands of dollars
from the coffer

728
00:38:23,182 --> 00:38:24,474
without anyone noticing.

729
00:38:24,557 --> 00:38:27,265
Why would we pump more money
into the school system?

730
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:28,909
Right, if a scandal
this seismic breaks,

731
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:31,432
I mean, our budget
is torpedoed, done.

732
00:38:31,516 --> 00:38:32,796
We are right back to square one.

733
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:34,766
I don't know,
you can't pay the teachers.

734
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:36,265
Maybe they start migrating out.

735
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:38,557
Whoa, this can't affect
the colleges, huh?

736
00:38:38,641 --> 00:38:40,849
I think we'd have to expect
that admissions

737
00:38:40,933 --> 00:38:42,213
at top-tier schools
would view us

738
00:38:42,265 --> 00:38:43,808
under a radically
different lens, yeah.

739
00:38:43,891 --> 00:38:45,531
No, wait, what, what,
why would they ever?

740
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,891
If they smell trouble,
then they...

741
00:38:48,557 --> 00:38:50,784
I don't know,
they might decide to lay off
Roslyn kids for a while.

742
00:38:50,808 --> 00:38:52,307
"Yeses" can become
"nos" overnight.

743
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:54,432
I've-I've heard of that
happening before.

744
00:38:54,891 --> 00:38:56,683
I have.
So anyway, let's just...

745
00:38:57,307 --> 00:38:58,891
let's tease this out, okay?

746
00:38:59,891 --> 00:39:02,766
We don't perform,
we go down in the rankings.

747
00:39:02,849 --> 00:39:05,557
And then our sister schools
nose us out of
the top ten, top hundred.

748
00:39:05,641 --> 00:39:07,391
Syosset and Jericho,
those sons of bitches.

749
00:39:07,474 --> 00:39:08,700
And that's when
we start seeing

750
00:39:08,724 --> 00:39:10,724
property values
adversely affected.

751
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,265
He's right.
Of course he is.

752
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,432
As far as real estate,

753
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,140
especially Long Island,

754
00:39:24,516 --> 00:39:26,015
a town is only as good as its...

755
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:27,641
Public school system.

756
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:31,974
After everything
we've worked for, huh?

757
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:35,933
Years that it's taken to,
to, to get this far.

758
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,265
These are our kids
we're talking about.

759
00:39:43,766 --> 00:39:45,599
I can think of one other option.

760
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:51,432
Frank.

761
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:54,015
Everything's gonna be okay, Pam.

762
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:57,474
We're, we're gonna get you
home to your family real soon.

763
00:39:58,224 --> 00:40:00,099
We're good, close the door.

764
00:40:01,516 --> 00:40:04,099
The board is very aware
of how hard you worked

765
00:40:04,182 --> 00:40:06,182
for the schools,
for Roslyn, for their kids.

766
00:40:06,265 --> 00:40:09,015
They know what an asset
you've been, and, um...

767
00:40:09,557 --> 00:40:12,182
that is why they see this
for-for what it is.

768
00:40:12,265 --> 00:40:13,391
A lapse in judgment.

769
00:40:13,474 --> 00:40:15,057
And in light of that,
they're opting

770
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,307
not to press charges
or involve the police.

771
00:40:17,391 --> 00:40:19,224
Thank you, thank you.
All of you.

772
00:40:19,307 --> 00:40:21,933
So you'll make full
restitution to the school

773
00:40:22,015 --> 00:40:24,307
at the sum of $250,000.

774
00:40:24,974 --> 00:40:27,140
250, full...
Full restitution, of course.

775
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:28,391
I'll, I'll make it happen.

776
00:40:28,474 --> 00:40:29,700
And then you'll finish out
the work week

777
00:40:29,724 --> 00:40:31,307
and resign quietly.

778
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,182
Wait.

779
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:38,349
- What?
- Okay.

780
00:40:38,432 --> 00:40:39,659
Tomorrow morning,
you'll surrender

781
00:40:39,683 --> 00:40:41,599
your administrators license
to the board

782
00:40:41,683 --> 00:40:43,599
and you'll sign
an NDA committing...

783
00:40:43,683 --> 00:40:46,683
Frank, Frank, I don't...
I don't understand
what's happening.

784
00:40:46,766 --> 00:40:48,516
I don't understand this.
Why are you...

785
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:51,307
You stole from the schools, Pam.

786
00:40:51,391 --> 00:40:53,599
From, from the taxpayers.

787
00:40:53,683 --> 00:40:56,015
From, from the kids
we're supposed to serve.

788
00:40:57,015 --> 00:40:58,391
I mean, this...

789
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:01,391
kind of behavior goes beyond
the bounds of immoral.

790
00:41:01,474 --> 00:41:03,307
It, it's, it's cruel, it's...

791
00:41:03,808 --> 00:41:06,391
It's heinous.
It's, it's sociopathic, even.

792
00:41:06,641 --> 00:41:08,140
Sociopathic, what?

793
00:41:08,224 --> 00:41:09,557
The shameless self-interest.

794
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:12,432
The, the, the
unstable personality.

795
00:41:12,516 --> 00:41:15,349
The parade
of rotten marriages, it...

796
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:17,057
Frank.

797
00:41:18,974 --> 00:41:20,724
Look, you need help, Pam.

798
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:22,891
Real medical help.

799
00:41:23,557 --> 00:41:24,808
You're a sick woman.

800
00:41:24,891 --> 00:41:26,891
We're concerned about you, Pam.

801
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:40,224
Um...

802
00:41:41,683 --> 00:41:43,182
I am...

803
00:41:43,557 --> 00:41:45,015
I'm a sick woman.

804
00:41:46,015 --> 00:41:47,391
I'm...

805
00:41:47,474 --> 00:41:50,557
I'm ashamed of my actions.
I'm ashamed of myself. I'm...

806
00:41:51,224 --> 00:41:53,349
There's no excuse for it.

807
00:41:54,182 --> 00:41:56,349
Well, the sociopathy.

808
00:41:57,766 --> 00:41:59,766
- Yeah, Bob, the...
- Yeah.

809
00:42:02,474 --> 00:42:03,557
Okay.

810
00:42:03,933 --> 00:42:06,333
We'll make all the arrangements
first thing tomorrow morning.

811
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:16,599
Yeah, of course.

812
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,224
Good night, all.

813
00:42:26,432 --> 00:42:28,432
Well, that went better
than I thought.

814
00:42:29,683 --> 00:42:30,974
You saved our ass, Frank.

815
00:42:31,057 --> 00:42:33,641
- Oh, God, yeah.
- Thank you.

816
00:42:33,724 --> 00:42:34,933
Yeah.

817
00:43:05,974 --> 00:43:07,474
What the hell was that?

818
00:43:08,557 --> 00:43:10,432
I... can you hear me?

819
00:43:11,474 --> 00:43:12,474
Frank?

820
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,224
Okay.

821
00:43:16,307 --> 00:43:18,808
I'm just, I'm just trying to...

822
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:20,599
I'm trying to wrap
my head around this.

823
00:43:52,891 --> 00:43:54,140
Hey.

824
00:43:54,224 --> 00:43:55,544
I wasn't sure
you were gonna call.

825
00:43:57,849 --> 00:43:59,349
Is everything okay?

826
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:01,849
Yeah, sorry, I, um...

827
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,015
just wanted to hear your voice.

828
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:25,057
- Where is he?
- Pam.

829
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,808
- Where is he?
- Pam, just...

830
00:44:26,891 --> 00:44:28,450
- Just sit down for a second.
- No, I wanna talk to Jimmy.

831
00:44:28,474 --> 00:44:30,033
- Where is he?
- Just sit down for a little bit.

832
00:44:30,057 --> 00:44:31,450
Is he in this room?
No, he's in
his bedroom, isn't he?

833
00:44:31,474 --> 00:44:32,683
- Just...
- Don't touch me.

834
00:44:32,766 --> 00:44:34,099
- Don't touch me!
- All right!

835
00:44:37,432 --> 00:44:38,599
Hey, Ma.

836
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:44,391
Hi, Ma?

837
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:45,766
Hi, Ma?

838
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:48,075
- Hey, Aunt Pam!
- Get outta my house, Jimmy!

839
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:50,349
- Pam!
- I don't want you here anymore.

840
00:44:50,432 --> 00:44:51,808
- Get the hell out!
- Pam.

841
00:44:51,891 --> 00:44:53,492
- I don't wanna see
your face anymore.
- Pam, stop it.

842
00:44:53,516 --> 00:44:54,909
- Stop it, you don't mean it.
- Hey, what's going on?

843
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:56,683
You don't mean it.
She doesn't mean it, Jim.

844
00:44:56,766 --> 00:44:59,086
- She doesn't mean
one word of it.
What's going on?

845
00:45:00,766 --> 00:45:01,991
Your mother lost her job today.

846
00:45:02,015 --> 00:45:04,683
Yeah, not my job, Howard.
My career.

847
00:45:05,432 --> 00:45:07,724
I don't get it, can't you
just get a different job

848
00:45:07,808 --> 00:45:09,224
at another school?

849
00:45:14,808 --> 00:45:16,724
They're taking my license.

850
00:45:17,724 --> 00:45:19,265
Mom, what did you do?

851
00:45:23,307 --> 00:45:24,933
I took money from them.

852
00:45:26,683 --> 00:45:28,974
Yeah, I stole.
We all did.

853
00:45:29,474 --> 00:45:31,450
Okay, look, just go back
to your rooms, please.

854
00:45:31,474 --> 00:45:32,617
- Yeah.
- Please let me talk
to your mother.

855
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:34,140
Your car, your clothes.

856
00:45:34,224 --> 00:45:35,724
This house, the other houses.

857
00:45:35,808 --> 00:45:39,307
- What are you talking about?
- You didn't want state school.

858
00:45:39,683 --> 00:45:41,599
You wanted private college.

859
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:46,224
I wanted you
to be happy with me.

860
00:45:46,307 --> 00:45:49,349
Pam, Pam, listen.
It's okay.

861
00:45:49,891 --> 00:45:52,307
We'll get you a job down
at the dealership, okay?

862
00:45:53,057 --> 00:45:55,933
Yeah, yeah, they're looking for
a new girl at the front desk.

863
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,057
- Like a secretary?
- No, no.

864
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,516
Not, not as...
Not like a secretary.

865
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:02,158
You'll find something.
I'm just saying...

866
00:46:02,182 --> 00:46:03,349
- I have degrees.
- I know.

867
00:46:03,432 --> 00:46:06,224
I went to school for years
to get degrees.

868
00:46:06,307 --> 00:46:08,557
I drove the bus.
I did the steno pool.

869
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:11,182
- I did everything I had to.
- Listen to me, Pam.

870
00:46:11,265 --> 00:46:13,140
- Listen to me.
- I'm gonna be sick.

871
00:46:13,224 --> 00:46:15,766
You are the smartest woman
I have ever known.

872
00:46:15,849 --> 00:46:17,450
We're gonna get through this
and you're gonna

873
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:19,307
land on your feet, you will.

874
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,349
Come here.

875
00:46:23,724 --> 00:46:25,349
- Howard.
- I know.

876
00:46:26,057 --> 00:46:27,557
- Howard.
- I know.

877
00:46:28,224 --> 00:46:29,432
I know.

878
00:46:41,516 --> 00:46:43,015
Hi, Mrs. Gluckin.

879
00:46:43,474 --> 00:46:44,849
Uh, I was just wondering.

880
00:46:44,933 --> 00:46:46,933
Could I get the key
to the basement again?

881
00:46:47,015 --> 00:46:49,474
I just want to look up
a few more things.

882
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,724
What's this for, Rachel?

883
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:54,307
Just for some stuff
I wanted to verify.

884
00:46:54,683 --> 00:46:56,099
I can answer your questions.

885
00:46:58,224 --> 00:47:00,349
Uh, okay, well...

886
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,641
I did the math,
and it looks like the SkyWalk

887
00:47:03,724 --> 00:47:06,307
is gonna end up costing
around eight million dollars.

888
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:08,140
- Seven-five, sure.
- Right.

889
00:47:08,224 --> 00:47:10,432
It just seems like
a lot of our resources

890
00:47:10,516 --> 00:47:12,265
to be spending on cosmetics.

891
00:47:13,391 --> 00:47:16,599
Cosmetics?
People love the SkyWalk.

892
00:47:16,683 --> 00:47:18,182
"The Beacon" loves the SkyWalk.

893
00:47:18,265 --> 00:47:19,974
There was that nice poll
you guys did.

894
00:47:20,057 --> 00:47:21,349
Right.

895
00:47:21,432 --> 00:47:23,974
But the ceilings at the
high school are still leaking.

896
00:47:24,057 --> 00:47:26,097
I mean, some of the classrooms
had to get shut down.

897
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,200
Sounds like you
should bring that up

898
00:47:27,224 --> 00:47:29,057
with your student government.

899
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,140
There was also the pizza oven.

900
00:47:34,224 --> 00:47:36,182
- What?
- I saw a line item

901
00:47:36,265 --> 00:47:38,808
in the expense reports
for a pizza oven.

902
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,766
But then I asked Paula
in the cafeteria

903
00:47:40,849 --> 00:47:42,369
and she said she knew
nothing about it.

904
00:47:42,432 --> 00:47:43,641
Just stop it.

905
00:47:48,307 --> 00:47:50,265
I am sorry to be the one
to tell you this,

906
00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:52,933
but no one is keeping
anything from you, okay?

907
00:47:53,015 --> 00:47:55,683
On the contrary,
we come in here every day

908
00:47:55,766 --> 00:47:58,140
at the crack of dawn
because we care.

909
00:47:58,599 --> 00:47:59,974
We care about providing you

910
00:48:00,057 --> 00:48:03,557
with a proper quality education
because we're good people.

911
00:48:03,933 --> 00:48:06,182
Because we want you
to have a good life.

912
00:48:06,265 --> 00:48:07,599
Okay?

913
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:10,808
Okay.

914
00:48:11,265 --> 00:48:12,391
Okay.

915
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:17,808
The individual purchase orders
are still public record, though.

916
00:48:26,182 --> 00:48:27,516
Here you go.

917
00:48:29,641 --> 00:48:31,265
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

918
00:48:31,974 --> 00:48:33,057
Oh, and Rachel.

919
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:35,224
You were right about
that pizza oven.

920
00:48:35,557 --> 00:48:37,140
It didn't go to the high school

921
00:48:37,474 --> 00:48:39,432
because we bought it
for the middle school.

922
00:48:39,974 --> 00:48:42,391
Yeah, they have pizza
for days down there.

923
00:48:42,474 --> 00:48:43,808
Go get yourself a slice.

924
00:48:50,307 --> 00:48:51,224
Morning.

925
00:48:51,307 --> 00:48:52,933
- Hi.
- Oh, hey, Rachel.

926
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,182
Dr. Tassone, Pam Gluckin's
in a bit of a state.

927
00:48:57,265 --> 00:48:58,849
Yeah, I have a very
busy morning.

928
00:48:58,933 --> 00:49:00,683
Just tell her I can't.
Good morning.

929
00:49:01,516 --> 00:49:04,015
Frank, Frank, Frank!

930
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:05,099
Fra...

931
00:49:10,724 --> 00:49:12,450
I'm sorry, Dr. Tassone's
very busy this morning.

932
00:49:12,474 --> 00:49:13,533
Get out of my way, Mary Ann.

933
00:49:13,557 --> 00:49:15,140
- Pam, Pam.
- Please.

934
00:49:16,349 --> 00:49:18,015
You know what?
It's fine.

935
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:22,182
Everything's fine.

936
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:45,891
My exit interview for him.

937
00:49:55,307 --> 00:49:56,808
- Hey.
- Hey, Dr. Tassone.

938
00:49:56,891 --> 00:49:59,140
Uh, Mary Ann said
you wanted to see me?

939
00:49:59,224 --> 00:50:01,599
Yes, yes.
Uh, take a seat.

940
00:50:01,683 --> 00:50:03,557
Just close the door
behind you there.

941
00:50:08,933 --> 00:50:11,307
So, I think maybe

942
00:50:11,391 --> 00:50:14,265
it is time that we talked
about your value

943
00:50:14,349 --> 00:50:15,891
in this workplace.

944
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,140
I, uh...

945
00:50:21,474 --> 00:50:23,391
- This isn't...
- No, rest assured,

946
00:50:23,474 --> 00:50:25,933
we all want you to succeed here.

947
00:50:26,766 --> 00:50:28,599
Which is...

948
00:50:28,683 --> 00:50:32,683
Which is why we would like
to transition you

949
00:50:32,933 --> 00:50:35,224
to our special utilities
department.

950
00:50:36,808 --> 00:50:38,099
Oh.

951
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:40,140
Sir, um...

952
00:50:40,224 --> 00:50:43,265
you know, I just thought I was
a really good fit up here.

953
00:50:43,349 --> 00:50:45,849
Oh, yeah, no, no, no.
We're just doing some shuffling

954
00:50:45,933 --> 00:50:48,265
and we could really use
an extra hand down there.

955
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:49,891
Okay?

956
00:50:51,516 --> 00:50:54,432
What about Pam's old job?
You know, I thought maybe, uh,

957
00:50:54,516 --> 00:50:56,516
you know, like a manager,
maybe I could be...

958
00:50:56,599 --> 00:50:58,140
Maybe I could be right for that.

959
00:50:58,224 --> 00:50:59,700
Yeah, well, actually,
Philip Metzger's

960
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:02,516
gonna be stepping in as
the interim business manager.

961
00:51:02,974 --> 00:51:04,557
- Phil the auditor?
- Yeah, yeah.

962
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:07,599
I mean, until we can find
a more permanent
replacement for Pam.

963
00:51:07,683 --> 00:51:09,099
But...

964
00:51:09,808 --> 00:51:11,182
we're pretty excited about him.

965
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,265
I think that I should, uh...

966
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:21,307
think, um...

967
00:51:25,265 --> 00:51:28,599
I know what you all did to Pam.

968
00:51:30,516 --> 00:51:32,516
And I could,
you know, I could...

969
00:51:33,432 --> 00:51:35,808
maybe tell people.

970
00:51:35,891 --> 00:51:38,391
- Sorry, hold on a second.
- I'm so sorry to interrupt.

971
00:51:38,474 --> 00:51:41,391
I just noticed that necklace
you have on.

972
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:43,974
How it really
complements your eyes.

973
00:51:45,099 --> 00:51:46,891
- Thank you.
- It's, uh,

974
00:51:46,974 --> 00:51:48,391
yeah, that's,
that's new, isn't it?

975
00:51:48,474 --> 00:51:50,849
I don't think I've seen you
wearing it around before.

976
00:51:52,307 --> 00:51:54,766
Yeah, I thought so.
Yeah. I've got...

977
00:51:54,849 --> 00:51:57,099
I got sort of an eye for
these things, I don't know.

978
00:51:57,182 --> 00:51:58,808
So, um, what do you think?

979
00:51:58,891 --> 00:52:01,516
Is that... is that
a Macy's purchase
or are we talking

980
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,307
Lord & Taylor collection?

981
00:52:10,015 --> 00:52:11,766
Special utilities, you said?

982
00:52:12,015 --> 00:52:14,015
Yeah, I think so.

983
00:52:15,808 --> 00:52:17,474
Okay, thanks, Jen.

984
00:52:37,974 --> 00:52:40,724
Mary Ann, can I get a cup
of that new coffee in here?

985
00:52:49,683 --> 00:52:50,991
Oh, Rocco, you're so annoying.

986
00:52:51,015 --> 00:52:52,015
Get out of the way.

987
00:52:52,724 --> 00:52:54,182
Go.

988
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:07,516
- Mom!
- This is she.

989
00:53:09,182 --> 00:53:10,265
No.

990
00:53:10,933 --> 00:53:12,015
Wait, what?

991
00:53:12,391 --> 00:53:15,557
Yeah, thank you.
Please don't call here again.

992
00:53:15,641 --> 00:53:17,075
- Who was that?
- That was a student.

993
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:18,825
They want to donate
the fashion show proceeds

994
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:21,015
to help pay for
my medical expenses.

995
00:53:21,557 --> 00:53:23,075
- But you're not sick.
- Don't eat that.

996
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:24,099
We're returning them.

997
00:53:24,182 --> 00:53:26,599
Pam, what the hell is going on?

998
00:53:29,557 --> 00:53:31,307
Okay, uh...

999
00:53:31,391 --> 00:53:33,057
first off, we want
to take a moment

1000
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,974
to acknowledge Pamela Gluckin.

1001
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,516
Uh, our hearts go out to her
and her entire family

1002
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:41,557
and we wish her a safe
and speedy recovery, yeah.

1003
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:46,182
Okay, all right, now.

1004
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:47,599
Onto the fun stuff.

1005
00:53:49,391 --> 00:53:51,015
Look at these numbers, folks.

1006
00:53:51,557 --> 00:53:54,015
These are the best
early decision numbers

1007
00:53:54,099 --> 00:53:55,974
that we've ever seen.

1008
00:53:56,432 --> 00:53:57,557
Yeah.

1009
00:53:57,641 --> 00:53:59,474

1031
00:55:46,432 --> 00:55:48,391
Hey, Rachel, um,
where's the article

1032
00:55:48,474 --> 00:55:50,391
on the
Cancer Benefit Fashion Show?

1033
00:55:50,849 --> 00:55:52,766
I'll get that to you tomorrow.

1034
00:55:53,182 --> 00:55:54,766
But we go to print tomorrow.

1035
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,933
Okay, I'll have it tonight.

1036
00:55:57,766 --> 00:55:59,557
Look, if you wanna be
a part of the paper,

1037
00:55:59,641 --> 00:56:01,391
you gotta be a part
of the paper.

1038
00:56:01,474 --> 00:56:03,015
Look, I'm gonna be late.

1039
00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:04,599
Rachel. Rachel!

1040
00:56:06,766 --> 00:56:08,015
- Shit.
- Oh, my God.

1041
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:10,474
- Sorry, shit.
- Seriously?

1042
00:56:14,933 --> 00:56:16,224
What is this?

1043
00:56:16,307 --> 00:56:19,766
It's just a personal project.
None of your business.

1044
00:56:24,265 --> 00:56:26,391
Look, I'm sorry
for being a hard-ass.

1045
00:56:26,766 --> 00:56:28,808
I know you're going through
a lot at home.

1046
00:56:28,891 --> 00:56:30,391
What's that supposed to mean?

1047
00:56:31,766 --> 00:56:33,891
You know, just everything
with your dad.

1048
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,099
Yeah, what about him?

1049
00:56:37,891 --> 00:56:39,891
I mean, the parents
talk to each other.

1050
00:56:39,974 --> 00:56:42,641
I know that some shit
happened at work.

1051
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:45,432
You don't know anything.

1052
00:56:45,724 --> 00:56:47,849
Ow.
Fuck, Rachel.

1053
00:57:13,808 --> 00:57:15,849
Rach?

1054
00:57:17,057 --> 00:57:18,516
- Dinner.
- Okay.

1055
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:21,724
What's all this?

1056
00:57:22,349 --> 00:57:24,015
Uh, research.

1057
00:57:24,099 --> 00:57:26,849
These are invoices
from the school district.

1058
00:57:36,099 --> 00:57:38,349
The school district invoiced
over a million dollars

1059
00:57:38,432 --> 00:57:39,808
in lab equipment?

1060
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:42,891
And that's just one supplier.

1061
00:57:46,391 --> 00:57:48,349
You thought about
calling this company?

1062
00:58:00,933 --> 00:58:02,766
Oh, God, I'm gonna
miss my flight.

1063
00:58:03,182 --> 00:58:04,974
Not if you stay another day.

1064
00:58:05,224 --> 00:58:06,933
You know I can't do that.

1065
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:11,849
You could get a job here.

1066
00:58:13,641 --> 00:58:15,641
There are schools
in Clark County.

1067
00:58:15,724 --> 00:58:17,057
Sure, but good ones?

1068
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,015
Was Roslyn any good before you?

1069
00:58:29,933 --> 00:58:33,307
Hi, is this Champion Products
in Uniondale?

1070
00:58:33,391 --> 00:58:35,307
- Yes, it is.
- Hi, my name is Rachel.

1071
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:37,033
I was just hoping to ask you
about a series of charges.

1072
00:58:37,057 --> 00:58:38,408
Okay, yes, yes.
Thank you for
verifying, Felice.

1073
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:39,641
You've been a huge help.

1074
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,599
- Yeah.
- Thank you, bye-bye.

1075
00:58:42,974 --> 00:58:44,224
That's right.

1076
00:58:46,224 --> 00:58:47,432
Yeah, I can hold.

1077
00:58:56,432 --> 00:58:59,265
Bellmore Fine Auto,
this is Howard.

1078
00:59:00,349 --> 00:59:03,557
Uh, I'm sorry.
Bellmore Fine Auto?

1079
00:59:03,641 --> 00:59:07,641
I had this number listed
as an H.G. Consulting.

1080
00:59:24,182 --> 00:59:25,766
Hi.

1081
00:59:26,974 --> 00:59:28,140
What's the matter?

1082
00:59:28,516 --> 00:59:31,599
Oh, nothing,
I'm just, just tired.

1083
00:59:32,349 --> 00:59:33,933
I'll take those invoices.

1084
00:59:43,224 --> 00:59:45,891
Next up is WordPower Tech.

1085
00:59:46,474 --> 00:59:49,599
Now, they billed
the school district $800,000

1086
00:59:49,683 --> 00:59:51,724
but no one has any idea
who they are.

1087
00:59:51,808 --> 00:59:53,015
And they're consistent.

1088
00:59:53,099 --> 00:59:55,182
They've billed every year
for the past ten.

1089
00:59:55,265 --> 00:59:57,849
Yeah, the company's registered
to Thomas Tuggiero

1090
00:59:57,933 --> 00:59:59,391
with an address in Manhattan.

1091
00:59:59,474 --> 01:00:01,891
I tried calling but the number
is disconnected.

1092
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:04,474
We're gonna leave that one
a question mark for right now

1093
01:00:04,557 --> 01:00:08,265
because the next one I've got
is Porto Office Supplies.

1094
01:00:08,349 --> 01:00:10,849
Now, I can't find any...

1095
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:24,724
What, did you forget your key?

1096
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:27,766
Oh.

1097
01:01:28,432 --> 01:01:29,641
Hello.

1098
01:01:33,557 --> 01:01:35,099
Can I help you with something?

1099
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:36,766
Is this...

1100
01:01:38,766 --> 01:01:40,432
Uh, I'm...

1101
01:01:40,849 --> 01:01:41,974
I'm canvassing.

1102
01:01:42,849 --> 01:01:44,099
For who?

1103
01:01:48,516 --> 01:01:50,599
Oh, um, it's...

1104
01:01:50,933 --> 01:01:52,891
I'm, I have the wrong apartment.

1105
01:02:39,974 --> 01:02:41,683
You're back.

1106
01:02:41,766 --> 01:02:44,307
I'm back.
Hey, thanks.

1107
01:02:47,474 --> 01:02:48,683
Hey, what's for dinner?

1108
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:50,724
Salmon.

1109
01:03:00,015 --> 01:03:01,641
What's the matter?

1110
01:03:03,182 --> 01:03:05,182
Oh, it's just work.
Sorry.

1111
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,891
The salmon's a little dry.

1112
01:03:09,974 --> 01:03:11,224
It's great.

1113
01:03:12,891 --> 01:03:14,641
I can tell when you're lying.

1114
01:03:20,057 --> 01:03:21,265
A little dry, maybe.

1115
01:03:21,349 --> 01:03:23,140
The couscous, though,
is a small masterpiece.

1116
01:03:23,224 --> 01:03:25,057
Oh, well, thank you very much.

1117
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:32,391
How was Omaha?

1118
01:03:33,057 --> 01:03:35,849
Mm, dull.
Dull as all hell.

1119
01:03:38,891 --> 01:03:40,140
So...

1120
01:03:40,849 --> 01:03:43,474
So I'm sitting there
sandwiched between
Doug and Joe

1121
01:03:43,557 --> 01:03:45,766
and there's no A/C
in the conference center

1122
01:03:45,849 --> 01:03:47,808
so you can imagine
the smell while they...

1123
01:03:47,891 --> 01:03:50,224
- Oh, God.
- Talked for hours

1124
01:03:50,307 --> 01:03:54,307
about STEM programs
and state aid.

1125
01:03:54,391 --> 01:03:55,849
It was, oh, yeah.

1126
01:03:55,933 --> 01:03:58,891
- It was, it was a riot.
- Oh, sounds like a nightmare.

1127
01:04:01,891 --> 01:04:03,474
Maybe I'll come along next time.

1128
01:04:05,724 --> 01:04:07,099
As a buffer.

1129
01:04:10,224 --> 01:04:11,891
I would never
subject you to that.

1130
01:04:52,599 --> 01:04:54,974
Okay, you have documents
to back this up?

1131
01:04:55,307 --> 01:04:57,557
Years' worth of supposed
payments to vendors

1132
01:04:57,641 --> 01:04:59,891
and confirmation
they were never received.

1133
01:05:00,182 --> 01:05:02,057
Some of these companies,
they don't even exist.

1134
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:03,766
Well, no, you don't know that.

1135
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:06,557
I mean, you know
that for sure, right?

1136
01:05:06,641 --> 01:05:07,849
WordPower Tech.

1137
01:05:07,933 --> 01:05:09,700
They've billed the district
almost a million dollars

1138
01:05:09,724 --> 01:05:11,307
and no one knows anything.

1139
01:05:11,808 --> 01:05:13,116
- Because it isn't anything.
- Okay.

1140
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:14,825
It is a private apartment
on the upper East Side.

1141
01:05:14,849 --> 01:05:16,849
- Yes, but that doesn't...
- And our superintendent

1142
01:05:16,933 --> 01:05:18,974
- has the key.
- necessarily
mean that it's fake.

1143
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:22,641
Come on, Nick,
you know what this is.

1144
01:05:22,724 --> 01:05:25,224
If he hasn't reported this,
it's fraud.

1145
01:05:25,307 --> 01:05:27,516
He's writing my college
recommendation letter.

1146
01:05:32,265 --> 01:05:34,849
Fuck, fuck, god damn it.

1147
01:05:35,641 --> 01:05:37,849
What are we even
talking about right now?

1148
01:05:39,891 --> 01:05:43,015
Are you sure?
Are you sure, sure, sure

1149
01:05:43,099 --> 01:05:44,683
you actually wanna do this?

1150
01:06:16,057 --> 01:06:17,474
Mind if I join you?

1151
01:06:30,724 --> 01:06:32,004
Don't ever let a doctor find out

1152
01:06:32,057 --> 01:06:33,683
you have high
cholesterol, Rachel.

1153
01:06:33,766 --> 01:06:35,891
They'll make you do
the most horrible things.

1154
01:06:40,432 --> 01:06:41,557
So.

1155
01:06:42,557 --> 01:06:43,766
About yesterday.

1156
01:06:44,557 --> 01:06:46,015
Yeah, uh...

1157
01:06:47,307 --> 01:06:49,224
- That was...
- What were you doing there?

1158
01:06:51,099 --> 01:06:52,349
I'm not upset.

1159
01:06:52,432 --> 01:06:55,224
But it is very important
that you be honest.

1160
01:06:57,307 --> 01:07:00,307
I was following up
on the listed address

1161
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:01,974
for a school contractor.

1162
01:07:03,391 --> 01:07:04,766
Why were you doing that?

1163
01:07:06,432 --> 01:07:08,352
It's public record.
Anyone could take the time...

1164
01:07:08,432 --> 01:07:10,032
I didn't ask you
if it was public record.

1165
01:07:10,099 --> 01:07:11,808
I... I just asked you why.

1166
01:07:15,808 --> 01:07:17,474
It's for something I'm writing.

1167
01:07:25,432 --> 01:07:27,182
I think you have real potential.

1168
01:07:27,265 --> 01:07:29,265
- Dr. Tassone...
- No, I'm serious.

1169
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:31,474
I, I read all your bylines.

1170
01:07:31,557 --> 01:07:33,477
You've come such a long way
since past September.

1171
01:07:33,557 --> 01:07:35,724
Your confidence,
strength of ability.

1172
01:07:35,933 --> 01:07:37,493
- Thank you.
- No, you have a tremendous

1173
01:07:37,557 --> 01:07:39,099
future ahead of you,
Rachel, you do.

1174
01:07:39,182 --> 01:07:40,182
But...

1175
01:07:40,641 --> 01:07:43,057
You're still young, too.
Which is why

1176
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:45,766
you need to know,
and I mean this,

1177
01:07:45,849 --> 01:07:47,808
if you go public...

1178
01:07:48,641 --> 01:07:50,891
with something you
don't fully understand,

1179
01:07:50,974 --> 01:07:53,683
it'll, it'll come back
on you hard.

1180
01:08:13,099 --> 01:08:14,474
I don't know, I...

1181
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:17,140
I guess it's our fault, mainly.

1182
01:08:18,015 --> 01:08:19,891
We try to create
a safe environment

1183
01:08:19,974 --> 01:08:21,265
for students to...

1184
01:08:22,099 --> 01:08:25,015
challenge, take risks,
make mistakes, grow.

1185
01:08:26,349 --> 01:08:28,849
But this mistake,
if you make it,

1186
01:08:29,557 --> 01:08:31,140
we will not
be able to protect you.

1187
01:08:31,224 --> 01:08:35,057
Not me, not your teachers.
Because it'll change everything.

1188
01:08:35,641 --> 01:08:37,724
And a lot of innocent people
will get hurt.

1189
01:08:39,516 --> 01:08:40,557
Right?

1190
01:08:41,057 --> 01:08:42,766
I mean, these kinds of inquiries

1191
01:08:42,849 --> 01:08:45,641
are, are... are like
setting off a grenade.

1192
01:08:46,808 --> 01:08:49,140
There's fallout in the pursuit.

1193
01:08:50,057 --> 01:08:51,265
In the frenzy.

1194
01:08:51,349 --> 01:08:53,015
There's collateral damage.

1195
01:08:53,683 --> 01:08:55,015
Right...

1196
01:08:55,099 --> 01:08:56,683
You must know all about that.

1197
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:06,057
It's not perfect, but it works.

1198
01:09:07,391 --> 01:09:09,015
What we have here works.

1199
01:09:09,974 --> 01:09:11,557
I hope we can keep it that way.

1200
01:09:16,015 --> 01:09:19,099
♪ ♪

1201
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:46,766
- All right, let's get into it.
- Uh, Rachel.

1202
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:49,641
Hey, Rachel.

1203
01:09:50,224 --> 01:09:51,891
Rachel, are you still with us?

1204
01:09:54,265 --> 01:09:55,641
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

1205
01:09:55,933 --> 01:09:57,307
- Sorry.
- All right.

1206
01:09:57,391 --> 01:09:58,391
Question number four,

1207
01:09:58,432 --> 01:09:59,808
what is the symbol
for potassium?

1208
01:09:59,891 --> 01:10:01,182
Anybody?

1209
01:10:11,182 --> 01:10:12,265
Yeah.

1210
01:10:14,057 --> 01:10:15,099
Hey, Frank.

1211
01:10:16,182 --> 01:10:19,391
I've been doing some more
digging over the past week.

1212
01:10:20,224 --> 01:10:22,474
I'm... concerned...

1213
01:10:23,349 --> 01:10:25,057
with what I found.

1214
01:10:25,766 --> 01:10:27,265
Okay, come in.

1215
01:10:29,516 --> 01:10:31,516
Look, now we don't
have receipts,

1216
01:10:32,057 --> 01:10:35,099
but some of these vendors,
they're...

1217
01:10:38,474 --> 01:10:41,474
this Pam thing isn't
a question of $250,000

1218
01:10:41,557 --> 01:10:42,974
like we'd initially thought.

1219
01:10:44,849 --> 01:10:46,516
Well, okay, uh,

1220
01:10:46,599 --> 01:10:48,724
do you have any sense
of what the number might be?

1221
01:10:48,808 --> 01:10:51,599
I mean, are we talking 500?

1222
01:10:51,683 --> 01:10:53,391
Are we talking a million?

1223
01:10:53,474 --> 01:10:55,575
I mean, Phil, work with me.
I can't do anything but just...

1224
01:10:55,599 --> 01:10:57,140
I don't know, I don't know.

1225
01:10:58,057 --> 01:11:00,307
You don't... okay, fine.
So...

1226
01:11:01,307 --> 01:11:02,557
figure it out, all right?

1227
01:11:02,641 --> 01:11:03,974
Work your numbers magic
and then,

1228
01:11:04,057 --> 01:11:06,766
let's the two of us deal
with it from there, okay?

1229
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:09,224
Thanks, Phil.

1230
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:10,766
Well, there's something else.

1231
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:12,140
Yeah, yeah.

1232
01:11:12,891 --> 01:11:16,307
A flight to London, Heathrow,
over winter break...

1233
01:11:16,391 --> 01:11:17,671
- billed to...
- Yeah, that's me.

1234
01:11:17,724 --> 01:11:19,283
That flight was for me,
for the Pell Conference.

1235
01:11:19,307 --> 01:11:20,599
You knew about the Pell.

1236
01:11:20,683 --> 01:11:22,516
First class, Concorde jet.

1237
01:11:23,182 --> 01:11:25,140
We, well, yeah.
I mean, look.

1238
01:11:25,224 --> 01:11:28,432
I don't book the flights.
That's always been Jenny's job.

1239
01:11:28,516 --> 01:11:31,307
- But look, even if I had...
- The charge is for two seats.

1240
01:11:32,849 --> 01:11:35,683
Two seats side by side in first.

1241
01:11:36,599 --> 01:11:39,349
It's $5,000 each way per ticket.

1242
01:11:39,432 --> 01:11:41,182
It's $20,000.

1243
01:11:42,808 --> 01:11:44,683
Yeah, well, that sounds
like a mistake.

1244
01:11:46,057 --> 01:11:47,683
You know, I called the airline.

1245
01:11:52,015 --> 01:11:53,849
Who's Kyle Contreras?

1246
01:12:01,808 --> 01:12:03,182
Wow.

1247
01:12:07,182 --> 01:12:10,057
Wow.
Okay, okay.

1248
01:12:11,391 --> 01:12:13,057
So that's how you wanna play it.

1249
01:12:13,724 --> 01:12:14,849
What, no.
I'm not playing...

1250
01:12:14,933 --> 01:12:16,265
I mean, the audacity.

1251
01:12:16,641 --> 01:12:19,015
Coming from the man
who spent six months

1252
01:12:19,099 --> 01:12:22,307
falsifying our records
to mask his own negligence

1253
01:12:22,391 --> 01:12:23,933
of fiduciary duty to the school.

1254
01:12:24,015 --> 01:12:26,557
Wait a second, that's not what,
that's not what's going on.

1255
01:12:26,641 --> 01:12:27,557
No, no?

1256
01:12:27,641 --> 01:12:29,391
Pam didn't
have to happen, right?

1257
01:12:29,474 --> 01:12:31,683
You could have prevented that.
You're the auditor.

1258
01:12:32,224 --> 01:12:34,140
The people here
pay you for what?

1259
01:12:34,432 --> 01:12:36,933
So you can go off
and do your community theater

1260
01:12:37,015 --> 01:12:39,099
instead of taking care of
our school's books?

1261
01:12:40,057 --> 01:12:41,265
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1262
01:12:41,933 --> 01:12:43,808
Oh, I can
point fingers too, Phil.

1263
01:12:44,683 --> 01:12:46,099
Right, but I think we both agree

1264
01:12:46,182 --> 01:12:48,325
that that wouldn't be a very
productive use of our time.

1265
01:12:48,349 --> 01:12:50,099
- But...
- Phil.

1266
01:12:50,849 --> 01:12:52,391
Are you gonna do your job,

1267
01:12:52,474 --> 01:12:54,933
or do I have to call Hevesi
in here himself

1268
01:12:55,015 --> 01:12:56,349
to come and do it for you?

1269
01:12:56,432 --> 01:12:58,099
Because I will call him
right now.

1270
01:12:58,182 --> 01:12:59,391
I will deal with it.

1271
01:12:59,891 --> 01:13:01,659

I shouldn't have.

1272
01:13:01,683 --> 01:13:03,641
Yeah, damn right
you shouldn't have.

1273
01:13:04,683 --> 01:13:06,265
You won't hear about it again.

1274
01:13:07,224 --> 01:13:08,432
Good.

01:13:10,474 --> 01:13:11,724
Get out of here.

1276
01:13:38,891 --> 01:13:40,641
Hey, Dad, can I
ask you something?

1277
01:13:42,766 --> 01:13:44,726
And you don't have to answer
if you don't want to.

1278
01:13:45,891 --> 01:13:47,641
Yeah, you can ask me anything.

1279
01:13:49,307 --> 01:13:50,724
Um...

1280

Did you really not know?

1285
01:14:07,182 --> 01:14:09,474
Are you asking me
if I was a part of it?

1286
01:14:12,516 --> 01:14:13,683
No, I wasn't.

Not at any point in time,
I promise you.

But, uh...

1289
01:14:22,849 --> 01:14:24,289
You gotta understand,
those were guys

that I had come up with
my entire career.

1291

Guys whose kids you and Neil
played with on the weekends.

1292
01:14:30,182 --> 01:14:33,140
Guys with families.
They were good people.

And it was all gonna
even out in the long run.

So who cares?

1295

I didn't say anything.

Uh, it was nowhere fancy.
It was...

a pizza place on Bell Boulevard.

1339
01:18:38,599 --> 01:18:40,766
Two Greek salads
and a fountain drink.

1340
01:18:41,974 --> 01:18:44,766
And I fucked up, I used
the wrong card by accident.

1341
01:18:44,849 --> 01:18:46,474
It's for $20.

1342
01:18:46,933 --> 01:18:49,307
And I said, I'd even it
all out on Monday.

1343
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:51,140
I'd reimburse the school
out of pocket.

Whatever we had to do, you know.

Monday came and went.

Nobody said anything.
Nobody, nobody cared.

01:22:47,974 --> 01:22:50,182
I very much hope that
you will still consider me

1419
01:22:50,265 --> 01:22:51,516
for this amazing program.

1420
01:22:51,599 --> 01:22:54,140
I believe I am very bright
and could benefit

1421
01:22:54,224 --> 01:22:56,683
from learning
thusly at an ack...

1422
01:22:58,683 --> 01:23:00,307
- Ack...
- Okay, sound that out.

1423
01:23:00,391 --> 01:23:01,599
- Acc...
- Acc...

1424
01:23:01,683 --> 01:23:03,516
- Accelerated?
- Mm-hmm, that's right.

1425
01:23:03,599 --> 01:23:05,432
Dr. Tassone.
You hear what
Dr. Tassone said?

1426
01:23:05,516 --> 01:23:08,557
Okay, all right,
start again from the beginning
of the paragraph.

1427
01:23:09,808 --> 01:23:12,182
Good afternoon, Dr. Tassone.
How was your weekend?

1428
01:23:12,265 --> 01:23:13,659
-Good, I hope.
-Oh, no, no,
let's, let's skip

1429
01:23:13,683 --> 01:23:15,140
to that trouble sentence
there, Chad.

1430
01:23:15,516 --> 01:23:17,641
That's okay.
All right, yeah,
take your time.

1431
01:23:17,724 --> 01:23:18,766
From...

1432
01:23:19,391 --> 01:23:21,849
I believe I am very bright
and could benefit

1433
01:23:21,933 --> 01:23:24,891
from learning thusly
at an ack...

1434
01:23:25,599 --> 01:23:27,974
- Accelerated.
- "Ackselated"?

1435
01:23:28,057 --> 01:23:29,474
Accelerated.

1436
01:23:29,724 --> 01:23:32,724
- "Arrelicated"?
- Ac-celerated.

1437
01:23:36,724 --> 01:23:37,849
Okay.

1438
01:23:39,307 --> 01:23:40,974
Do you like race cars, Chad?

1439
01:23:42,349 --> 01:23:43,766
Yeah?
Okay.

1440
01:23:48,099 --> 01:23:49,432
Let's say you're in a racecar.

1441
01:23:49,516 --> 01:23:51,265
All right, here,
you don't need that.

1442
01:23:54,224 --> 01:23:55,557
You're in a racecar.

1443
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:58,683
First place at the Indy 500

1444
01:23:58,766 --> 01:24:01,599
with, with all the sponsorships
in the world.

1445
01:24:02,557 --> 01:24:04,933
The wind is in your hair
and you're feeling just great,

1446
01:24:05,265 --> 01:24:07,933
and all of a sudden,
you feel this thing behind you

1447
01:24:08,015 --> 01:24:09,015
digging into your fender,

1448
01:24:09,099 --> 01:24:10,499
and you look
into the mirror, right.

1449
01:24:10,557 --> 01:24:12,575
And there's this hook.
There's a hook in your fender

1450
01:24:12,599 --> 01:24:15,224
dug in real good,
and it's connected to a...

1451
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:17,766
A long metal rope
and at the end of that rope

1452
01:24:17,849 --> 01:24:20,432
is, well, it's a massive
five-ton cinder block.

1453
01:24:20,516 --> 01:24:21,724
Okay, Chad?
All right?

1454
01:24:21,808 --> 01:24:24,891
So your job is driving.
You're Dale Earnhardt

1455
01:24:24,974 --> 01:24:27,057
and here's this cinder block,
and all the other cars

1456
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:28,557
are soaring past you and

1457
01:24:28,641 --> 01:24:30,057
you've gone from
first to last place

1458
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:31,575
and you keep thinking
to yourself, "What the hell

1459
01:24:31,599 --> 01:24:33,241
do I have to do to
get this thing off my back?"

1460
01:24:33,265 --> 01:24:34,784
Well, I'll tell you, Chad.
It's real simple.

1461
01:24:34,808 --> 01:24:37,557
You just put your foot
on the gas real hard

1462
01:24:37,641 --> 01:24:40,057
and you accelerate,
you accelerate so fast

1463
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:43,057
that rope snaps in two,
the cinder block explodes,

1464
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:44,391
and just say it with me, Chad.

1465
01:24:44,474 --> 01:24:47,057
Accelerate.
Accelerate. Accelerate.

1466
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:48,849
- Accelerate?
- Yes.

1467
01:24:50,641 --> 01:24:52,307
- Okay.
- Yes.

1468
01:24:52,391 --> 01:24:55,140
What, what
is your problem, huh?

1469
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:57,307
My problem?

1470
01:24:59,432 --> 01:25:00,766
My problem is you.

1471
01:25:01,766 --> 01:25:04,057
Carol, it's, it's,
it's the people who

1472
01:25:04,307 --> 01:25:07,224
who trot their poor children out
like racehorses at Belmont.

1473
01:25:07,307 --> 01:25:09,474
- Excuse me?
- Who derive some perverse joy

1474
01:25:09,557 --> 01:25:12,224
out of treating us like
low-level service reps.

1475
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:13,825
- Okay...
- I mean, do you remember

1476
01:25:13,849 --> 01:25:16,683
the teachers who sat with you,
who held you by the hand,

1477
01:25:16,766 --> 01:25:18,432
- who taught you to add.
- No.

1478
01:25:18,516 --> 01:25:20,432
And subtract,
or showed you Gatsby,

1479
01:25:20,516 --> 01:25:22,766
Salinger for the first time.
"Mockingbird," even.

1480
01:25:22,849 --> 01:25:24,683
Do, do their names escape you?

1481
01:25:24,766 --> 01:25:25,867
- Are their faces a blur?
- Okay.

1482
01:25:25,891 --> 01:25:27,182
No, you listen to me!

1483
01:25:29,307 --> 01:25:30,808
You don't wanna see us as people

1484
01:25:30,891 --> 01:25:33,516
because that is not
convenient for you.

1485
01:25:33,808 --> 01:25:36,849
You just
leave us behind at will.

1486
01:25:36,933 --> 01:25:38,557
Never think about us again.

1487
01:25:38,974 --> 01:25:41,808
All right, you might forget,
but we don't.

1488
01:25:42,182 --> 01:25:45,015
We never forget, ever.

1489
01:25:48,432 --> 01:25:49,933
What's wrong with him?

1490
01:25:50,015 --> 01:25:51,432
You know what, I don't know.

1491
01:25:51,516 --> 01:25:53,659
I don't think anything's wrong.
We're gonna get some food

1492
01:25:53,683 --> 01:25:55,140
and we're gonna go home, okay?

1493
01:25:55,224 --> 01:25:56,891
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

1494
01:25:58,182 --> 01:25:59,724
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

1495
01:26:32,766 --> 01:26:35,140
Two beach front homes
in Florida and the Hamptons.

1496
01:26:35,224 --> 01:26:39,140
Five Yamaha Jet-Skis.
Luxury cars.

1497
01:26:39,432 --> 01:26:43,766
Vacations to Brazil,
Puerto Rico, Hawaii.

1498
01:26:45,891 --> 01:26:49,140
Electronics,
jewelry and artwork.

1499
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:52,015
- Dog food.
- Is my lawyer here yet?

1500
01:26:52,099 --> 01:26:53,683
You're going away
for a long time, Pam.

1501
01:26:53,766 --> 01:26:55,991
And not just you.
We've got enough here
to indict the whole family.

1502
01:26:56,015 --> 01:26:59,099
- Don't you talk about them.
- And poor Jim especially.

1503
01:26:59,391 --> 01:27:01,391
Just gettin' back
on his feet and all.

1504
01:27:01,974 --> 01:27:03,974
You have any idea what
the job market looks like

1505
01:27:04,057 --> 01:27:05,933
these days for ex-cons?

1506
01:27:10,557 --> 01:27:11,974
You know...

1507
01:27:12,057 --> 01:27:14,974
it may not be too late
for you to save them.

1508
01:27:15,974 --> 01:27:17,140
Save your son.

1509
01:27:26,974 --> 01:27:28,432
What are you doing here?

1510
01:27:29,933 --> 01:27:31,307
I wanted to see you.

1511
01:27:34,974 --> 01:27:36,432
You don't have work?

1512
01:27:37,099 --> 01:27:38,683
I quit.

1513
01:27:41,391 --> 01:27:43,140
- When?
- Today.

1514
01:27:43,933 --> 01:27:45,015
I just...

1515
01:27:45,599 --> 01:27:47,766
just got on a plane
and now I'm here.

1516
01:27:47,849 --> 01:27:50,432
And I... I'm not leaving again.

Hey.

1564
01:31:39,474 --> 01:31:42,516
There's $30,000 in the
top drawer of the dresser.

1565
01:31:44,391 --> 01:31:46,140
- What?
- Okay, if you're careful,

1566
01:31:46,224 --> 01:31:47,891
you can make it last a year.

1567
01:31:48,307 --> 01:31:51,224
- What are you talking about?
- What you've got in you

1568
01:31:51,891 --> 01:31:55,224
is so special that you
can't ever, ever let anyone

1569
01:31:55,307 --> 01:31:58,265
take it away from you
or exploit it.

1570

What the hell...

1571

You really, you really...

1572
01:32:01,891 --> 01:32:03,575
- is happening right now?
- You don't want me here.

1573
01:32:03,599 --> 01:32:05,158
You're under arrest
for a warrant

1574

is happening right now?

1577
01:32:10,182 --> 01:32:11,492
Sir, I need your hands

1578

Frank, what the hell
is happening right now?

1579
01:32:13,599 --> 01:32:14,641

1580
01:32:14,724 --> 01:32:16,349
- Frank!
- Okay, I'm no good.

1581
01:32:16,432 --> 01:32:18,325
Hands on the dash now!
- All this time I've been
lying to you

1582
01:32:18,349 --> 01:32:19,599
and everyone else.
I'm a liar.

1583
01:32:19,683 --> 01:32:21,563
Now!
- Put your hands
on the dash now.

1584
01:32:21,599 --> 01:32:23,683
Do what... Frank,
do what they say, now.

1585
01:32:23,766 --> 01:32:25,116
- Get out of the car.
- I'm sorry.

1586
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:27,182
- No, no, no.
- Out of the car.

01:32:28,432 --> 01:32:29,557
Frank!

1588
01:32:29,641 --> 01:32:31,891
- No, sir, stand back,
sir, stop.
- Frank!

1589
01:32:32,265 --> 01:32:34,349
He's not doing anything.
Leave him alone.

Frank, Frank, Frank!

1592
01:32:44,015 --> 01:32:46,099
We printed,

1593
01:32:46,808 --> 01:32:50,724
uh, pamphlets for
the school district.

1594
01:32:50,808 --> 01:32:52,349
Handbooks and such.

1595
01:32:52,808 --> 01:32:55,265
- We?
- Uh, me.

1596
01:32:57,474 --> 01:32:59,474
WordPower was just me.

1597
01:33:00,849 --> 01:33:02,099
No partners.

1598
01:33:02,974 --> 01:33:04,891
I only ask because it looks like

1599
01:33:04,974 --> 01:33:06,391
half your corporation's earnings

1600
01:33:06,474 --> 01:33:09,474
were transferred over
to one Francis A. Tassone.

You can't make me.

No, you, you can't...

1603

make me testify
against my spouse.

1604
01:33:26,099 --> 01:33:27,307
Spouse?

1605
01:33:29,683 --> 01:33:31,391
We're domestic partners.

1606
01:33:34,641 --> 01:33:36,808
We've been together 33 years.

1607
01:33:38,724 --> 01:33:40,766
We're entitled
to federal protections.

Everybody we spoke to
said Tassone

1611
01:33:50,015 --> 01:33:52,182
did talk about a spouse, a wife.

1612
01:33:52,265 --> 01:33:53,891
But that she'd been dead
for some time.

1613
01:33:53,974 --> 01:33:56,766
Thirty-odd years or something.
You remember that, uh,

1614
01:33:56,849 --> 01:33:58,641
bridal photo he had on his desk.

1615
01:33:58,724 --> 01:34:01,349

I mean, you must
have seen it, too.

I don't know how we ever
recover from this.

1634
01:35:58,557 --> 01:36:00,891
It was never the same between
the parents and teachers.

1635
01:36:00,974 --> 01:36:02,808
They treated us differently
after that.

Like we knew.

he was there with a smile.

I think it boils down

in our classrooms

1671

and our approach
to a broad-minded,

1672
01:39:18,057 --> 01:39:20,974
hands-on education.

1673

That's all the stuff

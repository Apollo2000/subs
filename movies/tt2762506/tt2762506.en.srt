1
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,080
WESTERN PERNAMBUCO

2
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,960
A FEW YEARS FROM NOW.

3
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,040
What was that?

4
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,750
Look up ahead.

5
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,910
We'll take two.

6
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,660
What the hell.

7
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,340
<i>IF YOU GO, GO IN PEACE</i>

8
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,950
What's with the lab coat?

9
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,790
Isn't it hot?

10
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,950
Let's just say, it's kind of protection.

11
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,040
Got it.

12
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,290
They're after Lunga.

13
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:04,160
There's a big reward on her head too.

14
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,450
Don't expect me to turn Lunga in.

15
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,700
Me neither.

16
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,950
They're holding it all back.

17
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,830
Nobody did anything?

18
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,080
Lunga tried.

19
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,580
Now, I fill up with water
5-6 km up river.

20
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,410
They blocked all access.

21
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,200
About four months ago,

22
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,250
Lunga rocked up

23
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,410
with her gang and all guns blazing.

24
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,540
They killed three of them
but couldn't get it open.

25
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,660
Only Pacote knows where she is.

26
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,450
Look...

27
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,540
Bastard.

28
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,790
They're assholes.

29
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,540
Trigger-happy morons.

30
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,620
Anything unusual,
they open fire to scare you off.

31
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,910
Let's go.

32
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,330
Sure.

33
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,870
If only all cucks were like that.

34
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,580
Mrs. Domingas!

35
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,040
Damiano.

36
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,370
Open up.

37
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,160
Pass it on.

38
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,950
Grab the case.

39
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,040
The suitcase!

40
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,200
Careful with the suitcase.

41
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,790
- Here comes the case.
- The suitcase!

42
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,080
Thank goodness.

43
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,250
I'm glad you could make it, sweetie.

44
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,000
Your grandmother.

45
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,040
Carmelita!

46
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,410
Let's show some respect for Carmelita.

47
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,910
You old witch!

48
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,870
Whore! Lowlife cunt!
And you shut your mouths.

49
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,950
Shut up or you'll regret it.

50
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,370
I'd be curious to see if,

51
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,870
for my funeral,

52
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,450
so many people turn out.

53
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,450
Nobody will.

54
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,160
You were evil through and through!

55
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,250
You! What are you staring at?

56
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,410
Get away from that window!

57
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,330
You stuck-up prick!

58
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,080
- Okay, time to go.
- You, leave me alone.

59
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,120
Come on, woman, we're going.

60
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:12,200
- Don't you...
- This is not the time or place.

61
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,000
I'll be back.

62
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,250
She's my friend.

63
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,040
Everybody, can I have your attention?

64
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,870
I'll make the most
of the contribution from Domingas,

65
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,580
who is clearly very emotional,

66
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,370
to say a few words
about my mother, Carmelita.

67
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,250
Carmelita had children.

68
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,160
She had grandchildren...

69
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,160
great-grandchildren, godchildren...

70
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,500
She had lots of friends.

71
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,040
In our family, there are bricklayers

72
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,950
and scientists.

73
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,290
Teachers and doctors.

74
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,910
Architects,

75
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,910
gigolos and whores.

76
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,830
But not a single thief.

77
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,870
There are people in São Paulo,

78
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,200
Europe,

79
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,250
the United States...

80
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,540
People in Bahia and Minas Gerais.

81
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,790
Unfortunately, many couldn't come

82
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,620
to pay their respects

83
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,660
because of the problems in our region.

84
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,120
Instead, they sent their support.

85
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,000
Precious support for Bacurau.

86
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,500
Which goes to show

87
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:46,000
that Carmelita and Bacurau
live on in all of them.

88
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,450
Thank you, everybody.

89
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,620
Viva Carmelita!

90
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,950
It's time.

91
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,950
Careful, with the sheet.

92
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,660
My dear friends from Bacurau...

93
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:33,910
Let us begin the funeral procession
in honour of Mrs. Carmelita,

94
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,580
which is why all of Bacurau
is here with us today.

95
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,700
Carmelita lived 94 years
to tell the story.

96
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,830
She was a major figure
in our community.

97
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,080
As is customary, I'll now play you

98
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,450
the message from Mr. Sergio Ricardo...

99
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:12,330
<i>It is very late in the night</i>

100
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:19,790
<i>Now is the time for the Bacurau</i>

101
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:28,450
<i>The jaguar dances forward
The caipora and babau dance</i>

102
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:44,450
<i>A feast of fear and terror</i>

103
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:51,790
<i>Phantoms haunt the wake</i>

104
00:16:53,160 --> 00:17:00,500
<i>Punching holes in the trunk of night,
the woodpecker's beak</i>

105
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:15,700
<i>Spells are floating in the air</i>

106
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:23,370
<i>The work of an evil sorcerer</i>

107
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:32,080
<i>Charms and jinxes dreamed up
at the xangô in Nicolau's</i>

108
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,700
Second dead person I saw today.

109
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,830
Morning, girls.

110
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,580
Enjoying your shower?

111
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,540
Son, help your mother, will you?

112
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,250
<i>Dear listeners...</i>

113
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,580
<i>Breaking news.</i>

114
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,790
<i>After the incidents in Serra Verde,</i>

115
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,660
<i>for now and all next week,</i>

116
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,830
<i>we're cut off from southern Brazil.
The highway is shut</i>

117
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,950
<i>for at least another week.</i>

118
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:17,660
<i>The upcoming festival
in the neighbouring village is cancelled.</i>

119
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,450
<i>With motorcycle access only,
tricky to get your goat there.</i>

120
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,950
<i>Anyway, chin up!</i>

121
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,870
<i>It's a few minutes after 7 am.</i>

122
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,580
<i>Make the most of life
as long as we have life.</i>

123
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:41,080
Migraine, nausea, feeling like death.

124
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,290
That's a hangover.

125
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,040
Morning, doctor.

126
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,370
Morning.

127
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,290
I was drunk
so my wife kicked me out.

128
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,330
I need a bed to get some sleep.

129
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,370
Take number 2.

130
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,040
- Draw the curtain, please.
- Thank you.

131
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,700
Go home and drink heaps of water.

132
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,750
And vomit.

133
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,700
Vomit. More water.
And vomit again.

134
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,330
<i>Hello, hello, Paulo Roberto...</i>

135
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,580
<i>Jade's trying to reach you.</i>

136
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,040
<i>Answer the phone!</i>

137
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,750
<i>You're just down the street,
so keep connected.</i>

138
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,160
<i>Jade wants you to answer her call.</i>

139
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,040
<i>Today's weather forecast.</i>

140
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,700
<i>Temperatures will reach a high
of 36°C.</i>

141
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,870
Morning.

142
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,000
<i>And a low of 37°C.
It's a furnace out there.</i>

143
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,870
Some general information...

144
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,290
St. Francis natural leather sandals!

145
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,790
Humility is
the secret to success.

146
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,330
This is DJ Urso,
to the beat of Araripe.

147
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,830
Look.

148
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,080
Grandma's cake.

149
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,200
Like she knew you were coming.

150
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,790
Morning.

151
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,700
This dress was her favorite
for wearing around the house.

152
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,250
Morning, Mr. Plinio.

153
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,120
- Teresa, Madalena...
- Hi, Pacote.

154
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,700
Morning, Pacote.

155
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,410
If you don't mind,
I go by Acácio now. You see?

156
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,500
- Can I sit down?
- Sure. Take a seat, Acácio.

157
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,450
Acácio. I like it.

158
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,790
Acácio Albuquerque da Silva.

159
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,120
You're doing okay?

160
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Trying.

161
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,870
The thing in Serrita, that wasn't you?

162
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,660
Mr. Plinio, that was different.

163
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,250
Different but the same, Pacote.

164
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,620
I am trying, Mr. Plinio.

165
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,330
A compilation of your greatest hits
is out there.

166
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,750
There's a video?

167
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,580
No, it's dumb.
Please, don't watch it.

168
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,410
It's a video someone posted.

169
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,830
You can't really recognize me.

170
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,200
No. 6 isn't me.
It's another dude.

171
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,540
Knowing you, it's you.

172
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,830
You saw it?

173
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,120
Don't watch that stuff, Madalena.

174
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,160
Everybody watched it, dad.

175
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,290
The clothes in the living room,
they belonged to Carmelita?

176
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,790
Sleep with me tonight?

177
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,370
You're not in mourning?

178
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,950
I'm not religious.

179
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,700
Whoa.

180
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:48,250
What was going on
at the funeral yesterday?

181
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,160
Domingas lost it, right?

182
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,450
She was clearly emotional,
as my father said.

183
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,410
Bacurau couldn't handle Carmelita.

184
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,250
Now nobody knows
how to handle Domingas.

185
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,910
Her wife can handle her.

186
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,830
What do you see up there?

187
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,120
A plane!

188
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,620
Can it go faster than a bird?

189
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,950
Sure. It flies at 850 km/h.

190
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,450
From where?

191
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:42,750
- From São Luis, headed to São Paulo.
- It flew into a cloud.

192
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,500
So, the plane's flying to São Paulo.

193
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,250
How far is Bacurau from São Paulo?

194
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,790
Here, let's look it up on the map.

195
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,700
Look, everybody.

196
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,910
Let's see if we can find Bacurau here.

197
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,160
Let's see now...

198
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:03,000
- Here we are...
- Bacurau's probably too far, sir.

199
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,330
The satellite goes over here.

200
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,750
Sir, Bacurau should be here somewhere.

201
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,910
It should.

202
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,540
Let's look on the class computer.

203
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,000
In this heat, we need water.

204
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,750
Let's try the other computer.

205
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,950
Bacurau must be on the map.

206
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:25,040
If we can't find it here,
we'll take our time to look.

207
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,330
Are we going back inside, sir?

208
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,410
Yes, we're going to look it up
in the classroom.

209
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,910
Let's all try to find Bacurau on the map.

210
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,450
It's easy here. Let's see...

211
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,250
All right, everybody.

212
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,790
Here we go...

213
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,290
Hold on...

214
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,660
Forget the map.
Let's go satellite mode.

215
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,750
Serra Verde...

216
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,620
What?

217
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,700
It should be here.

218
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,450
Where's Bacurau?

219
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,830
Where's Granny Stella's house?

220
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,830
Sir, don't we pay
to be on the map?

221
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,540
No, Horacio.

222
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,910
Bacurau has always been here.

223
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,580
Down...

224
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,200
Here we have Serra Verde...

225
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,410
It should be right here.

226
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,410
Bacurau has always been on the map.

227
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,080
Well...

228
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,790
On this map here. Let's see.

229
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Here, on this one, Bacurau appears.

230
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,750
This map shows Bacurau.

231
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,000
Darlene!

232
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,540
Tony Junior's coming.

233
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,910
So I see.

234
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,160
Listen up.

235
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,000
Tony Junior's here.

236
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,200
I repeat.

237
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,200
Tony Jr. is on his way.

238
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,580
He'll be with you in five minutes.

239
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,410
<i>I repeat. Tony Jr. is on his way.</i>

240
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,790
<i>I repeat.</i>

241
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,870
<i>Tony Jr. will be with you
in five minutes.</i>

242
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,370
Your attention, please.

243
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,290
For anyone
who didn't hear Darlene's message,

244
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,950
<i>the Mayor's on the campaign trail.
Let's get organized.</i>

245
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,660
<i>Look out.</i>

246
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,410
<i>It's a surprise visit but we're on it.</i>

247
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,500
<i>Serra Verde needs him for Mayor</i>

248
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,290
<i>It was going good
It's gonna get better</i>

249
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,540
<i>You all know who's your best go-getter</i>

250
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,290
<i>Candidate 150 is the guy for you</i>

251
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,450
<i>Vote Tony Junior to be your Mayor!</i>

252
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,410
Film it!

253
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,330
Good morning.

254
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,250
Morning, everybody.

255
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,580
I know you're all listening to me.

256
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:16,370
I know we had our differences
in the past.

257
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,330
But today,

258
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,540
I come to you with an open heart.

259
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,540
I bring you all kinds of goodies.

260
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,120
Books for the school,

261
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:30,250
which has the best library
in the region, for sure.

262
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,120
The library run by Mr. Plinio
and Ms. Angela.

263
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,200
Right, Angela?

264
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,830
I also bring supplies.

265
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,620
Food. Always important.

266
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,500
And coffins.

267
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,040
Medication.

268
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,750
I'm there for you,
that's the honest truth.

269
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,290
Elections are coming, as everyone knows.

270
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,500
We are going to continue
moving forward together.

271
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,540
I'm standing for another term,
so that we can unite.

272
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,200
Starting with retinal scans.

273
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,160
I brought this reader device,

274
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:21,410
which makes life easy
for those who cannot come to vote.

275
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,410
So come on out.

276
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,410
There's nothing to worry about.

277
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,540
Open the dam, you crook!

278
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,290
Release the water!

279
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:34,160
If only politics were so easy.
I'd love to see you try.

280
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:37,950
The problem's far more complex,
but we'll fix the water issue.

281
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,040
Fuck you!

282
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,500
Easy now, let's talk.
I'm open to dialogue.

283
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,290
Go fuck yourself, you scumbag!

284
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,660
Crook!

285
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,040
Son of a bitch!

286
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,500
Beat it!

287
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,660
Get your lying ass out of here!

288
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,250
Release the water!

289
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,410
- She doesn't want to go.
- Butt out, kid.

290
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,870
Pay up front.

291
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,660
You need to pay up front.

292
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,870
Leave her alone.
Do it in the fucking truck.

293
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,910
It's cool, she'll be right back.

294
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,750
You weren't nice last time.

295
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,870
All righty.

296
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,330
They're forcing Sandra to go!

297
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,080
Pay up front. That's how it works.

298
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,700
The Mayor's taking Sandra by force.

299
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,620
Pay now.

300
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,500
What's this ruckus?

301
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,620
The girl will be back, no problem.

302
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,330
Listen, for your information,

303
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,080
whores vote too.

304
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,290
Put it on my tab for when I get back.

305
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,290
Let's go.

306
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:56,500
Sandra?

307
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,790
The girl doesn't want to go.

308
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,950
You're taking her anyway.

309
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,250
I saw her come into the world.

310
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,120
I liked her mother very much.

311
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,950
If she comes back hurt,

312
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,410
I'll feed your cock to the hens.

313
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,040
Evening, everyone.

314
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,290
We sorted the food
you can see on the table.

315
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:10,040
- Now I'll hand over to Mr. Plinio.
- Thanks, Amaury.

316
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,410
So then, folks,

317
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:15,450
we went through the supplies here.

318
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:19,540
Some things
are past their expiration dates,

319
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:22,160
sometimes by more than six months.

320
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,580
We didn't throw it away.
It's your call.

321
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,700
But I advise caution.

322
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,580
Tony Jr. donated
a thousand books to our community.

323
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:36,120
As usual, we'll take good care
of the better ones.

324
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:39,040
We'll sort them together.

325
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,620
Please, Dr. Domingas...

326
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,910
This week Teresa brought,
in her suitcase,

327
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,700
a selection of vaccines.

328
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,080
We are now stocked up

329
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,450
for polio, DPT and snake bite serum.

330
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:11,620
But let me call everyone's attention
to this boxload of Brasol IV

331
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,620
that Tony Jr. delivered today.

332
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,200
It's a Trojan horse.

333
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,660
A black label drug

334
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:23,370
given away free of charge,
without prescription.

335
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:28,410
As many of you already know,

336
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:33,000
Brasol IV is a mood inhibitor

337
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,040
presented as a powerful painkiller.

338
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:42,580
It's a drug taken
by millions of people all over Brazil.

339
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,250
Don't ask me why,

340
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:49,080
but suppository is the most
popular form of administration.

341
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,660
It's bad for you,

342
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:56,290
addictive, and it dulls your wits.

343
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,660
The box is here.

344
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,790
If you want some, help yourself.

345
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,370
I thought I'd let you know.

346
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,120
I just wanted to add...

347
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:18,870
I'd like to apologize to you all

348
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,290
for behaving so badly

349
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,580
at Carmelita's funeral.

350
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,910
Carmelita was an important person.

351
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,450
Carmelita is still important.

352
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:43,620
She's a sweetie when she's sober.

353
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,580
Help yourself to food.

354
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,950
Take what you need and share.

355
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,410
Sandra?

356
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,120
Well?

357
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,450
- Are you okay?
- I'm going home, all right?

358
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,660
You good, Sandra?

359
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,410
They're from Manelito's farm.

360
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,450
- And?
- Nobody's answering.

361
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,700
Go take a look,
that's the best idea.

362
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,700
- We'll be in touch.
- Sure.

363
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,000
Thanks.

364
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,450
Horses bolting, nobody answering.
Weird, right?

365
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,370
Manelito, it's Acácio.
Flávio tried calling.

366
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,000
Your horses are in Bacurau.
The guys are bringing them over.

367
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,870
Your truck's full of holes.

368
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,120
- Come again?
- It's got holes.

369
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,910
Somebody shot at me.

370
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,620
What's going on, Erivaldo?

371
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,620
No idea. First I knew of this.

372
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,040
Two more here.

373
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,160
Go easy.

374
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,410
Plug the hole.

375
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,500
- With plastic?
- Give me that...

376
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,870
What happened?

377
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,660
No idea, Pacote.
I just noticed these bullet holes.

378
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,910
I took my usual route.

379
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:13,040
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

380
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,750
You never use your mirrors?

381
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,120
I keep my eyes on the road.

382
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,410
Plug those holes!

383
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,330
More buckets.

384
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,500
Hey, man, what's up?

385
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,750
<i>See anything strange on the road?</i>

386
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,750
No, why?

387
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,330
The water truck
came in full of bullet holes.

388
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,250
Bullet holes?

389
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,660
<i>Three of them.
You need to turn back.</i>

390
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,950
No way.

391
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,620
We're on our way there.

392
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:15,120
<i>Too bad. I'm serious, turn back.</i>

393
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:17,160
Wait, Pacote. Hold on.

394
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,790
<i>What's up?</i>

395
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,290
Two bikes headed for Bacurau.

396
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:26,000
Two motorbikes? Hold on...

397
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,080
Flávio, what bikes?

398
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,450
<i>Strangers. On trail bikes.</i>

399
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,660
Don't hang up. Are they stopping?

400
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,200
<i>Hold on, they're coming our way.</i>

401
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:56,250
Still there?
They're headed for Bacurau.

402
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,080
Two trail bikes headed for Bacurau.

403
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,080
Both riders wearing helmets.

404
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,200
They'll be there, in two minutes.

405
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:44,500
<i>Two trail bikes headed for Bacurau.</i>

406
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,620
<i>Both riders wearing helmets...</i>

407
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,290
We've drawn a crowd.

408
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,250
Morning.

409
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,830
Morning.

410
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,120
How are you?

411
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:52,370
What's up out there?

412
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,750
An issue with the water truck
or something.

413
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,870
Then you rock up with helmets on.

414
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:00,830
Bikers with helmets,
we don't like that.

415
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,000
We're not real bikers,
just out for a ride.

416
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,700
I thought so, from your outfits.

417
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,790
- Like them?
- Sure.

418
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:10,120
Thanks.

419
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,500
Do you have beer?

420
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,370
Sure. Beer, cachaça...

421
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,330
No, just a beer, please.

422
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,700
Get the lady a beer.

423
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:22,910
Sparkling water?

424
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:23,950
Yes.

425
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,250
And what's that?

426
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,660
- The green one?
- There.

427
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:30,290
A local soda. Want to try it?

428
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,370
No.

429
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,330
What are inhabitants of Bacurau called?

430
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,200
People!

431
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,250
Is there a word? Bacarauans?

432
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,120
You came to see the museum?

433
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,370
Museum? What museum?

434
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,760
The Bacurau museum. It's good.

435
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,140
Really?

436
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,510
It's right next door.

437
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,850
And Bacurau? Does it mean anything?

438
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:11,350
It's a bird.

439
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:12,720
A small bird?

440
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:15,930
No, it's a fairly big bird.

441
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,180
I see.

442
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:19,180
Extinct, I guess?

443
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:21,600
Not here.

444
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,720
Only comes out at night. A hunter.

445
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,180
Anyway, thanks a lot.

446
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:28,550
No problem.

447
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,600
Go?

448
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:32,050
Thanks, bye.

449
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:41,220
<i>Do you know, sir,
anything about the water truck?</i>

450
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:42,510
What about it?

451
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:48,600
<i>Do you know, sir,
anything about the water truck?</i>

452
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:50,890
What happened to it?

453
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:54,850
<i>It came in full of bullet holes.</i>

454
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:00,890
Very good.

455
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,140
<i>Good-looking guy,
he's gonna catch the queer eye</i>

456
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:06,850
Nice, thanks.

457
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,760
<i>Just like a movie star</i>

458
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,550
<i>His pride swells, his balls grow apart</i>

459
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,430
<i>Make the most of it now, dude,
old age sneaks up on you</i>

460
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:22,930
<i>Check out the pretty babe
with her brown hair</i>

461
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:27,930
<i>Dark sultry eyes and slender pink lips</i>

462
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:33,600
<i>She'll give killer coitus
and claim you were never near her hips</i>

463
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,260
You've got me all wrong.

464
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:37,430
Great, thanks.

465
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,220
<i>These folks from down south
get no sleep and less sun</i>

466
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:45,550
<i>The all learn to fish
without hook, line or fun</i>

467
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:48,640
<i>Acting like cocks of the walk</i>

468
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:51,390
<i>They don't know São Paulo's a powder keg!</i>

469
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,680
It shows
I'm from São Paulo?

470
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:56,430
Here, this is for you.

471
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,100
Actually, I'm from Rio.

472
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:00,600
<i>You can keep your money, lady.</i>

473
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:03,800
<i>I'm only messing with you</i>

474
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:06,720
Very good, really.

475
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:07,890
Very good.

476
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:12,850
Hey.

477
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:14,390
- Hi.
- How are you?

478
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,890
- Here to see the museum?
- No.

479
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:20,600
- How come?
- Not today.

480
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,220
We're in a hurry.

481
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:24,510
- On the way back?
- Yeah, maybe.

482
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:27,760
See the bullet-riddled truck?

483
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,850
- Bullet-riddled?
- Three shots in my tanker.

484
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,510
Is it yours? That sucks.

485
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:35,430
You didn't see anything on the road?

486
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,720
We left the road to ride on trails.

487
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,550
Really? Where you headed?

488
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,510
We're touring the region.

489
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,380
- Beautiful, right?
- And hot.

490
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:45,550
Beautiful hills.

491
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,430
Hi, is that a 200?

492
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,850
Yup, 200.

493
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:50,350
I plan to get one.

494
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,300
- Excuse me.
- Great machine.

495
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:54,890
When you came in, engine roaring...

496
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,850
Could hear it from miles around.

497
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:58,640
- Let's go?
- Sure, go.

498
00:48:58,810 --> 00:48:59,640
It's hot.

499
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:01,680
If you need anything,

500
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:04,850
I'm Erivaldo.
This is Teresa and Acácio.

501
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:06,640
- No, Pacote.
- Pacote?

502
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,510
Interesting name.

503
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,430
We're João and Maria.

504
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:14,640
- João and Maria...
- Nice meeting you.

505
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:17,390
Oddly, the village isn't on the map.

506
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,220
- Sure it is.
- We just stumbled on it.

507
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:22,890
Stroke of luck
'cause we were thirsty.

508
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,680
- It's Bacurau.
- I know, she said.

509
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:28,430
But it wasn't on the map
and there's no signal.

510
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,050
I tried sending a photo.

511
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:31,850
I just got a message.

512
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,300
No signal, guys.

513
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:35,430
True enough, no signal.

514
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,800
Weird, we always have reception here.

515
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,350
Bye, good to meet you.

516
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:44,890
- Take care on the road.
- Sure thing.

517
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:03,220
Shit, still no signal.

518
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:03,140
Soraya and her little girl.

519
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:10,680
Wait there.

520
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:12,100
- Let's go.
- Wait.

521
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,010
- Maciel!
- Be right back.

522
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,350
Maciel, come on!

523
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:37,640
Let's bail, Flávio.

524
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:40,050
They're all dead.

525
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,850
We're going to die.

526
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:10,010
No, they're tourists.
Look at the outfits.

527
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:11,760
You didn't see what I saw.

528
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:21,720
I went into the house.

529
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:23,930
You didn't see what I saw.

530
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,430
We're going to die.

531
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:27,510
Hi there!

532
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:29,510
Good morning.

533
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,760
All good?

534
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:34,100
Sure. You guys are riding trails?

535
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,260
You came from that farm?

536
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:38,680
Sure. The Tarairu farm.

537
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:43,390
If I were you, I wouldn't go.
There's been a tragedy.

538
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:46,930
You got phones on you?

539
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:49,890
- The signal's...
- Sure.

540
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,680
We called some guys to come out here.

541
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:57,470
You got a signal?
I heard there's no signal here.

542
00:52:58,390 --> 00:52:59,890
There <i>was</i> no signal.

543
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:06,760
Let's see your phones.

544
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:12,260
Lady, why you got guns?

545
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,850
Do you have guns?

546
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:16,300
Look, lady...

547
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:20,260
This isn't supposed
to happen around here.

548
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:21,350
What happened here?

549
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:23,600
You fucking bastards!

550
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:51,550
- Think we messed up?
- It's done now. Let's go.

551
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:27,600
We speak Portuguese.

552
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,140
- Water?
- No, thanks.

553
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:05,390
- Let it go.
- It creeps me out.

554
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:40,760
Assistant

555
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:43,180
federal judge.

556
01:06:44,810 --> 01:06:46,680
I should've come with them.

557
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:50,640
So there'd be 3 corpses?

558
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,350
Yesterday, I saw a drone.

559
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,140
Like a flying saucer
from some old movie.

560
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,010
But it was a drone.

561
01:07:08,930 --> 01:07:10,470
Where was this drone?

562
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:12,430
Near Bacurau.

563
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:30,600
Go back to Bacurau.

564
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:32,550
I'll go talk with Lunga.

565
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:33,930
Lunga...

566
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:37,140
A man is judged
by the evil he does,

567
01:07:37,310 --> 01:07:38,550
not the good.

568
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,350
That drone doesn't belong
to anyone local.

569
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,350
Watch the skies.

570
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,470
I told you guys not to go there.

571
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:22,680
Fuck!

572
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:30,470
I said turn back, dammit.

573
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:33,890
It had to be an ambush.
Fuck, Maciel!

574
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,470
Holy fucking shit.

575
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:22,390
Lunga, it's Pacote.

576
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:25,390
Let him in.

577
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:15,800
You're sure you weren't followed?

578
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:17,140
Positive.

579
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,180
Lunga, that's my cousin.

580
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,140
Is that Flávio?

581
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:43,890
Yes.

582
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:19,930
What the hell happened?

583
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:42,930
Does my aunt know?

584
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:44,930
No.

585
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:55,550
I found them at Tarairu.
Manelito's farm.

586
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:59,100
Everyone killed.
Soraya, her daughter, everyone.

587
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,640
I came to ask for your help.

588
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,800
Who did it?

589
01:12:09,470 --> 01:12:10,680
I don't know, Lunga.

590
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:14,510
They have killed seven
since yesterday. Seven.

591
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,890
- And shot up Erivaldo's truck.
- He's dead?

592
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:21,930
No, he was unhurt.

593
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,850
The truck was leaking water.

594
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:29,640
Leaking water...

595
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,640
- Lunga is exhausted.
- Bullshit.

596
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:38,510
I'm hungry.

597
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:43,260
Stuck here like that fag Che Guevara,
starving to death.

598
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:44,760
I'm hungry too.

599
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:48,140
Bacurau has food and water. Let's go.

600
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:50,890
People there know
all you do for them.

601
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:52,180
You're important.

602
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:16,890
So Pacote is back.

603
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:57,850
<i>Trigger King Pacote</i>

604
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:35,970
- You okay?
- No.

605
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,350
Amaury, turn that shit off.

606
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:47,680
Folks...

607
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:50,050
Lunga.

608
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:53,140
Holy shit.

609
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:07,180
Some outfit, kid!

610
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:12,100
A real beauty!

611
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:42,510
Domingas.

612
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:24,850
Great rhythm, right?

613
01:18:21,970 --> 01:18:24,100
In recent months, who moved back?

614
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:27,100
Madame came back with her people.

615
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:29,100
Cláudio and Nelinha.

616
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:31,430
Martina, too.

617
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:32,640
Martina.

618
01:18:32,810 --> 01:18:33,970
Sebastiana.

619
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:36,350
Erivaldo and his kids.

620
01:18:36,510 --> 01:18:37,470
José.

621
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,600
Me.

622
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:47,350
When I left, I hated the place.

623
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:51,760
But with what's going down,

624
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:53,300
we're back.

625
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:56,760
You were a good writer, Lunga.

626
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:00,100
You should've studied.

627
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:05,390
Now we have a hole to dig.

628
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:39,100
Here.

629
01:19:52,810 --> 01:19:54,550
I might reopen the church.

630
01:19:57,850 --> 01:20:00,600
Antonio, the church was never closed.

631
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,800
For some reason, it became storage.

632
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:05,470
But if it makes you happy,
we're happy.

633
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:14,640
And they were scared.

634
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:16,050
The dog ran away.

635
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:46,140
Guys! Guys!

636
01:20:46,810 --> 01:20:50,350
Let's play
who goes farthest in the dark.

637
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:55,050
- You have the flashlight, you go.
- Not me!

638
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:56,100
You then.

639
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:58,140
- Me? No.
- Yes, go on!

640
01:20:58,560 --> 01:20:59,640
Who wants to go?

641
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:01,470
- Me!
- I'll go.

642
01:21:01,810 --> 01:21:03,800
No, me. I want to go.

643
01:21:03,970 --> 01:21:05,430
Me first, come on.

644
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:06,930
You can go next.

645
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:23,680
Watch out for Carmelita!

646
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,260
And Flávio and Maciel!

647
01:21:26,930 --> 01:21:27,930
You'll scare him.

648
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:32,470
I bet he doesn't go any farther.

649
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:34,930
It is very dark.

650
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:36,930
- It's pitch black.
- Look!

651
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,300
He's gone.

652
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:39,470
Really far.

653
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:55,850
Whose turn is it now?

654
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:57,720
Come on, Rivaldo.

655
01:21:58,390 --> 01:22:00,010
You! It's your turn.

656
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:01,850
I'm brave.

657
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:06,510
We'll see if he really is brave.

658
01:22:31,930 --> 01:22:32,890
Go on!

659
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:47,220
We're under attack.

660
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:56,100
Keep digging.

661
01:24:01,010 --> 01:24:02,800
My God, the boy!

662
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:05,890
They killed him.

663
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:11,390
Dad, who did this?

664
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:13,760
I don't know.

665
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:23,720
Nelinha.

666
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:25,760
Let's get out of here.

667
01:25:25,930 --> 01:25:27,430
Are you crazy, Cláudio?

668
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,850
Come on, get in.

669
01:25:29,010 --> 01:25:31,890
I'm telling you, this is crazy.

670
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:35,930
Cláudio is taking off.

671
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:38,970
Wait, Cláudio!

672
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:43,430
Hold on, Cláudio, it's dangerous!

673
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:25,850
Open wounds, blessed heart.

674
01:26:26,010 --> 01:26:28,970
May the blood of Jesus Christ
keep us from peril.

675
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:30,760
Open wounds, blessed heart.

676
01:26:30,930 --> 01:26:33,720
May the blood of Jesus Christ
keep us from peril.

677
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:35,640
Keep us from peril.

678
01:26:37,810 --> 01:26:39,720
Cláudio, let's leave tomorrow.

679
01:26:39,890 --> 01:26:41,300
You can, Nelinha.

680
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:44,010
I'm not staying in this hell.

681
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:46,430
I know this road.

682
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,510
It's only an hour to Serra Verde.

683
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:51,850
In this darkness?

684
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:06,970
Did you see poor Flávio?

685
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,970
Keep calm, Nelinha.

686
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:10,720
And Maciel.

687
01:27:10,890 --> 01:27:12,640
I liked Maciel so much.

688
01:33:47,470 --> 01:33:49,930
I thought you were all dead.

689
01:33:51,010 --> 01:33:52,350
And as for you...

690
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:56,550
C'mon, buck up. Don't do this to me.

691
01:33:57,810 --> 01:33:59,850
Let's keep you good and lush.

692
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:03,050
Come on, my beauties.

693
01:34:03,510 --> 01:34:04,760
You're looking...

694
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:13,300
It's all good. Take it easy.

695
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:54,300

696
01:38:09,970 --> 01:38:11,470

01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:39,140

Why are you doing this?

702
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:48,850
Everybody left.

703
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:50,470
They were scared.

704
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:19,760

705
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:27,890

I want it to stay like that.

730
01:58:49,010 --> 01:58:50,930
Exactly as it is.

731
01:58:54,350 --> 01:58:55,510
Unfortunately.

732
01:59:38,100 --> 01:59:40,800
What happened?
Where are the gringo tourists?

733
01:59:51,180 --> 01:59:52,180
Shut the door.

734
02:00:00,060 --> 02:00:01,260
You need anything?

735
02:00:01,880 --> 02:00:02,640
Food?

736
02:00:02,810 --> 02:00:03,800
Medication?

737
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:07,600
They're dead.

738
02:00:11,140 --> 02:00:15,220
Lunga, you guys have got yourselves
in deep trouble.

739
02:00:15,390 --> 02:00:16,970
They are important people.

740
02:00:17,310 --> 02:00:19,890
The water issue,
we could resolve. Resolve.

741
02:00:20,510 --> 02:00:21,510
But this...

742
02:00:21,680 --> 02:00:25,470
We'll all pay for this.
Even I'll die for this.

743
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:29,760
In 24 hours, everything will be ashes.

744
02:00:29,930 --> 02:00:31,100
Right, Plinio?

745
02:00:32,260 --> 02:00:33,890
I had nothing to do with it.

746
02:00:34,810 --> 02:00:36,140
I'm on your side, Plinio.

747
02:00:38,810 --> 02:00:41,720
We have taken
a powerful psychotropic drug.

748
02:00:42,390 --> 02:00:43,760
And you are going to die.

749
02:00:46,430 --> 02:00:47,720
We can do this differently.

750
02:01:15,140 --> 02:01:16,390
Tony!

751
02:01:22,810 --> 02:01:24,510
Who the hell is that guy?

752
02:01:24,640 --> 02:01:25,720
Amigo!

753
02:01:25,890 --> 02:01:27,970
I don't know him, I never met him!

754
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:29,720
I don't know him.

755
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:35,470
I've no idea who the guy is.

756
02:01:35,890 --> 02:01:36,890
Quit yelling!

757
02:01:43,390 --> 02:01:45,680
Never met you, friend.
Quit shouting my name.

758
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:52,720
I don't know you, friend.

759
02:01:56,510 --> 02:01:57,350
Dinero.

760
02:01:57,510 --> 02:01:59,300
That's enough, stop saying that.

761
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:01,430
I don't know you. Get lost!

762
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:02,180
Dinero.

763
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:03,180
I don't know you.

764
02:02:14,220 --> 02:02:17,140
<i>All right, let's get this over with.</i>

765
02:02:17,930 --> 02:02:18,930
<i>He's leaving now.</i>

766
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:22,930
<i>The Mayor of Serra Verde municipality,
Tony Junior!</i>

767
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:25,350
<i>On his way to the Bacurau </i>caatinga.

768
02:02:25,510 --> 02:02:28,850
May he find there
the inner peace he sorely needs,

769
02:02:29,010 --> 02:02:31,510
among the cactuses,
thornbushes, mandacaru,

770
02:02:31,680 --> 02:02:33,100
favela and xique-xique.

771
02:02:33,260 --> 02:02:36,350
All those bushes
waiting to give him a spiky hug.

772
02:02:36,510 --> 02:02:39,180
Spinner of lies,
natural-born asshole.

773
02:02:40,100 --> 02:02:42,680
He brought pain
and suffering to our community.

774
02:02:44,140 --> 02:02:45,100
Today,

775
02:02:45,810 --> 02:02:48,680
we in Bacurau
say goodbye to this demon.

776
02:02:48,850 --> 02:02:51,350
Hopefully,
it's the last we'll see of him.

777
02:02:52,260 --> 02:02:56,300
That donkey better come back
unharmed from its miserable mission.

778
02:02:58,720 --> 02:03:00,260
Filthy son of a bitch.

779
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:01,850
Good riddance.

780
02:03:32,470 --> 02:03:35,430
I think he could have been
a good person once.

781
02:03:38,100 --> 02:03:39,680
Don't you think, Domingas?

782
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:45,010
He had a mother.

00:00:55,802 --> 00:01:00,034
If you could be anywhere in
the world where would you be?

3
00:01:00,073 --> 00:01:03,770
Anywhere in the world?

4
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,971
Yes, anywhere.

5
00:01:09,683 --> 00:01:12,777
A place where you could sing

6
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:14,912
and I'll be your manager.

7
00:02:36,636 --> 00:02:38,627

Everyone dismissed except
Miss Shireen Arshadi.

26
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:21,046
Please stay to speak
with the headmaster.

27
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,218
- I'll come with you.
- No.

28
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,732
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

29
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:45,465
We have a biology exam today.

30
00:03:45,505 --> 00:03:48,133
I'm her lab partner,
so I'll just wait for her.

31
00:03:48,174 --> 00:03:49,869
You've been busy all month.

32
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:54,074
I can arrange for plenty
of free time...

33
00:03:54,114 --> 00:03:56,810
At your service, ma'am.

34
00:03:58,785 --> 00:04:02,516
We usually don't let people
like you into our school.

35
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:08,258
Do you know why?

36
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:09,956
No, ma'am.

37
00:04:11,798 --> 00:04:14,323
Because their character
is questionable.

38
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:17,734
You're late again
with this semester's tuition.

39
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:20,968
Sorry, Madam Teacher,
it's my fault.

40
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:22,998
I borrowed some money
from Shireen, but...

41
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:25,511
Take it back.

42
00:04:25,545 --> 00:04:27,672
Bring it to my office later.

43
00:04:27,714 --> 00:04:29,409
Get to class.

44
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:48,560
"Your character is questionable."

45
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:14,453
Cello suites,

46
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:16,052
Bach.

47
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:17,063
More specific.

48
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:20,328
The cellist, the key, the movement.

49
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:28,564
Pablo Casals.

50
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:32,408
Minuet in D Minor.

51
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:37,007
Cello suites, Bach.

52
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:39,348
Mehran!

53
00:05:40,587 --> 00:05:43,784
The student has beaten his teacher.

54
00:05:43,823 --> 00:05:45,916
The prodigal son.

55
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:52,831
Welcome home.
Are you well?

56
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:55,926
Mom has made one
of her special cakes.

57
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:57,493
God help us.

58
00:05:57,537 --> 00:06:00,097
Eat it for your mother's sake.

59
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,505
Azar!

60
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:25,754
How about this one?

61
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:46,443
Mehran.

62
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:51,149
Here he is,
as good as new.

63
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:12,236
You've gotten so thin.

64
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:16,672
Are you feeling better?

65
00:07:16,716 --> 00:07:20,345
Mehran, I ran into Professor Jamshid

66
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:21,978
at the University yesterday.

67
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:28,017
There might be an opening
in the music department.

68
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:29,961
Music isn't for me
anymore, Father.

69
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:33,627
What are you saying?

70
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,759
I'm sorry, Father.

71
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:38,930
Mehran, you've worked so hard...

72
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:25,046
What, are you scared?

73
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:26,449
I told my uncle that I'd be home.

74
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:28,579
Come on, I'll make you
a respectable girl yet.

75
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:41,966
So, what's your name?

76
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,100
Let's see if you earn
the privilege to know my name.

77
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:49,298
Vanak Square.

78
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:51,742
What's your rush?

79
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:53,939
We're having fun.

80
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:03,414
Turn it up!
This song is orgasmic.

81
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:35,619
Who is it?

82
00:09:35,655 --> 00:09:38,055
We're here for the sewing class.

83
00:10:56,202 --> 00:10:57,931
Let me introduce you
to my friend.

84
00:10:57,971 --> 00:11:00,769
- Salaam.
- Salaam.

85
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:03,640
This is my cousin, Hossein,
who's coming from America.

86
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:04,643
America.

87
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:08,407
I'm gonna go dance.

88
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:13,112
Don't worry.
Tonight, I'm your professor.

89
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:24,521
Shireen,

90
00:11:24,564 --> 00:11:25,588
Ho-bag.

91
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:27,098
Ho-bag, Shireen.

92
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:30,000
Protection's in the drawer.

93
00:11:31,804 --> 00:11:33,203
Ho-bag?

94
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:35,434
Don't worry about it.

95
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:36,942
I can't hear you.

96
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:40,776
Let's go somewhere we can talk.

97
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:44,963
Can I ask you a question?

98
00:13:45,004 --> 00:13:47,165
Does it make you jealous?

99
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:51,074
Why would I be jealous?

100
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,101
Isn't he your boyfriend?

101
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:18,200
Boy, that's how it's done.

102
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:24,608
I knew you weren't such a good girl.

103
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,102
Open your mouth.

104
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:21,159
Hey, check this out.

105
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,532
Beautiful sparkles.

106
00:15:44,223 --> 00:15:45,053
Pour moi?

107
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:46,718
Pour toi, madame.

108
00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:15,083
This isn't necessary anymore.

109
00:16:17,757 --> 00:16:21,284
Dad, I'm not going to fuck up again.

110
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:24,494
I'm sorry.

111
00:16:49,055 --> 00:16:51,922
This is your weekly allowance.

112
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:54,289
I need all your receipts.

113
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:05,402
Kids, I have to get to work.

114
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:18,314
Mehran, I have to
tell you something.

115
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:20,251
You'll die of laughter.

116
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:24,814
Hello.

117
00:17:27,993 --> 00:17:31,190
- Mehran, are you OK?
- Leave me be.

118
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,394
Why can't you understand,
I'm better.

119
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:38,130
I was just...

120
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,365
I know exactly what the fuck
you were trying to do.

121
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:29,744
Can you help a brother?

122
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,451
Could you help a brother?

123
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:38,525
Here, brother.

124
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:40,395
Take this food.

125
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:44,262
My wife made it.

126
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:50,674
If you want help, I know a place
that can help you.

127
00:18:53,245 --> 00:18:55,839
Those addicts won't even
leave the mosque in peace.

128
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,242
The mosque is a place for everyone.

129
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:03,084
God is compassionate.

130
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:12,158
I'm only here
because of God's mercy.

131
00:19:18,137 --> 00:19:22,437
Seeing young believers
like yourself gives one hope.

132
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:29,141
I'm Mohammad Mehdi.

133
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:32,011
Your name, sir?

134
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:35,782
Pardon me.
My name is Mehran.

135
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:40,190
So dear Mehran,
what do you do?

136
00:19:40,226 --> 00:19:43,354
What's your profession?

137
00:19:49,535 --> 00:19:54,268
A true Muslim needs to work
and provide for a family.

138
00:19:54,306 --> 00:19:57,742
God has not willed it yet.

139
00:19:57,776 --> 00:20:00,609
Believe in God's plan.
He will provide.

140
00:20:25,871 --> 00:20:27,361
Good morning, mother.

141
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,437
Morning, son.

142
00:20:29,475 --> 00:20:32,308
Shireen, put on some clothes.
You have a suitor.

143
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:40,342
Yusef, please have a seat.

144
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:50,925
Shireen! Bring the tea.

145
00:21:09,014 --> 00:21:11,778
Yusef, I present
my niece, Shireen.

146
00:21:38,744 --> 00:21:40,041
Did something happen?

147
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,842
It's nothing.

148
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,415
What a heavy surgery.

149
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:49,847
My back and feet are killing me.

150
00:21:57,596 --> 00:22:03,432
I'm not that scary.
Tell me if something is wrong, OK?

151
00:22:03,502 --> 00:22:06,164
Mehran...

152
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:08,469
Tomorrow, we're all
going to the seaside.

153
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:11,909
Be ready at 7 A.M.

154
00:22:11,944 --> 00:22:13,639
Is that all, Dad?

155
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,271
That's all.

156
00:22:27,292 --> 00:22:29,954
Seems like yesterday,
they were children.

157
00:22:32,731 --> 00:22:35,131
Seems like yesterday,
we were young.

158
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:45,660
Little devil.

159
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:54,100
Dad, let's go swimming.

160
00:25:02,948 --> 00:25:05,940
You're all sweaty.
Go in the water.

161
00:25:07,486 --> 00:25:10,284
One day we can all go in
together.

162
00:26:26,198 --> 00:26:28,689
Mommy.

163
00:27:26,258 --> 00:27:27,885
I'm scared.

164
00:27:30,595 --> 00:27:34,759
It's nothing.
You're just a bit sick.

165
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:38,592
I love you.

166
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,271
I know.

167
00:27:49,214 --> 00:27:50,909
I want to tell you something.

168
00:27:52,951 --> 00:27:56,785
You don't need to,
I already know.

169
00:27:57,956 --> 00:27:59,480
Really?

170
00:28:03,295 --> 00:28:05,923
Let's run away to Dubai.

171
00:28:05,964 --> 00:28:09,456
You'll sing and
I'll be your manager.

172
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,495
You're delirious.

173
00:28:13,538 --> 00:28:17,804
In Dubai,
anything is possible.

174
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:17,682
It's cold.

175
00:31:17,722 --> 00:31:19,280
Scared?

176
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:28,958
Dad, pull over.

177
00:32:28,994 --> 00:32:30,689
Are you sick?

178
00:32:31,596 --> 00:32:33,894
It is time for my prayers.

179
00:32:33,932 --> 00:32:36,730
You're joking.

180
00:32:36,768 --> 00:32:39,430
No, it's not a joke.

181
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:50,703
Atafeh and Mr. Hakimi
will be here soon.

182
00:33:50,742 --> 00:33:53,176
I'll bring tea.

183
00:36:58,963 --> 00:37:00,794
Just wait a second...

184
00:37:00,832 --> 00:37:03,357
This system is hopeless.

185
00:37:03,401 --> 00:37:05,062
Wait, it will get fixed.

186
00:37:08,072 --> 00:37:09,437
1, 2, 3.

187
00:37:09,474 --> 00:37:11,965
I haven't attached the cord
and you're testing.

188
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:14,171
Can I help?

189
00:37:15,547 --> 00:37:17,139
With the will of God.

190
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,889
I'm grateful.

191
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:43,158
How I love this song!

192
00:39:37,388 --> 00:39:40,118
I know it's a bit late.

193
00:39:40,158 --> 00:39:42,524
But I just wanted to say
Happy Birthday.

194
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,858
Thanks.
It was three weeks ago.

195
00:40:14,192 --> 00:40:16,183
One day I'll win it.

196
00:40:16,227 --> 00:40:18,525
The young can dream.

197
00:40:35,379 --> 00:40:37,040
Let's go abroad.

198
00:40:45,523 --> 00:40:48,219
A place we can be free.

199
00:41:03,074 --> 00:41:04,405
We'll go to clubs.

200
00:41:06,077 --> 00:41:07,567
We'll have fun.

201
00:42:25,122 --> 00:42:26,783
Sweet!

202
00:42:26,824 --> 00:42:29,156
Do you feel embarrassed?

203
00:42:29,193 --> 00:42:31,058
A little.

204
00:43:47,138 --> 00:43:49,436
You know what this dork
wants to do here?

205
00:43:50,308 --> 00:43:51,935
Tell us.

206
00:43:51,976 --> 00:43:54,001
Dub "Milk" into Persian.

207
00:43:54,045 --> 00:43:56,673
In the film where Sean Penn is gay?

208
00:43:56,714 --> 00:44:00,650
Milk's non-violent protests
led to a movement.

209
00:44:00,685 --> 00:44:03,552
We'd be like Che.

210
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:06,488
Here they make Che
into a God-fearing man.

211
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:12,058
But they can't co-opt a gay figure.

212
00:44:12,096 --> 00:44:13,393
Yes, they can.

213
00:44:13,431 --> 00:44:15,456
They're experts.

214
00:44:15,499 --> 00:44:18,730
They'll make Milk
lead the anti-gay movement.

215
00:44:18,769 --> 00:44:19,997
Exactly.

216
00:44:20,037 --> 00:44:23,006
Don't you want to
change your circumstances?

217
00:44:26,777 --> 00:44:29,439
President Hossein Obama!

218
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,744
Change has come our way.

219
00:44:33,718 --> 00:44:37,882
Hey, don't make fun of Obama.

220
00:44:37,922 --> 00:44:40,447
Don't you see?

221
00:44:40,491 --> 00:44:43,927
What they were doing to the gays
30 years ago,

222
00:44:43,961 --> 00:44:46,589
they're doing to you now.

223
00:44:48,165 --> 00:44:50,656
We'll rock the country with this film.

224
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:52,726
We'll pour into the streets.

225
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:55,671
We're united together,
we are gay together.

226
00:44:55,706 --> 00:44:58,834
We knew you were gay.

227
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:03,306
Don't worry, Atie.

228
00:45:03,347 --> 00:45:05,577
I'll take the role of Milk.

229
00:45:05,616 --> 00:45:08,608
You play his lover,
Diego Luna.

230
00:45:08,652 --> 00:45:10,313
Does that mean I can fuck you?

231
00:45:10,354 --> 00:45:13,289
- Yes, please.
- Sweet!

232
00:45:13,324 --> 00:45:15,315
This film is not about fucking.

233
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,452
It's about human rights.

234
00:45:17,495 --> 00:45:19,520
Fucking is a human's right.

235
00:45:19,563 --> 00:45:22,031
I swear it's a human's right.

236
00:45:23,034 --> 00:45:24,467
Listen.

237
00:45:24,502 --> 00:45:26,231
We dub "Milk" in the day

238
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:27,635
for your subversive politics.

239
00:45:27,671 --> 00:45:29,639
And "Sex and the City"
for mainstream subversion.

240
00:45:29,673 --> 00:45:31,971
Isn't that a porn film?

241
00:45:32,009 --> 00:45:35,809
It's always the same with you, Joey.
You're really sick.

242
00:45:35,846 --> 00:45:39,475
"Sex and the City"
will sell like crazy.

243
00:45:39,517 --> 00:45:41,314
And we'll throw "Milk"
on the same DVD.

244
00:45:44,021 --> 00:45:47,184
I want to create serious dialogue.

245
00:45:49,193 --> 00:45:52,560
Sweetie, here anything illegal

246
00:45:52,596 --> 00:45:55,827
becomes politically subversive.

247
00:45:55,866 --> 00:45:58,835
Political acts aren't
that romantic, Atafeh.

248
00:45:58,869 --> 00:46:02,100
With the parents that you had,

249
00:46:02,139 --> 00:46:04,664
subversion and naughtiness
is in your blood.

250
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:06,198
Shut up, Joey.

251
00:46:06,243 --> 00:46:08,006
I can defend myself.

252
00:46:10,548 --> 00:46:11,674
What did I say?

253
00:46:13,851 --> 00:46:15,113
What did I say?

254
00:46:44,081 --> 00:46:45,878
Do you mind if I play music?

255
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:49,215
No, it's a nice song.

256
00:46:49,253 --> 00:46:51,346
Very relaxing.

257
00:46:53,691 --> 00:46:55,386
We can go somewhere relaxing.

258
00:46:55,893 --> 00:46:56,723
Excuse me?

259
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,193
Don't be coy.

260
00:46:58,229 --> 00:47:01,062
You're mistaken.
What do you take me for?

261
00:47:01,098 --> 00:47:02,395
What do you think you are?

262
00:47:02,433 --> 00:47:04,230
Sir, please stop the car.

263
00:47:04,268 --> 00:47:06,395
Don't think the clothes fool me.

264
00:47:06,437 --> 00:47:07,961
Stop. I want to get out.

265
00:47:08,005 --> 00:47:11,338
No matter how you dress
yourself, trash is trash.

266
00:47:13,911 --> 00:47:17,074
How about we go
to the police station?

267
00:47:17,114 --> 00:47:19,173
I have some friends there.

268
00:47:25,489 --> 00:47:27,047
Give me your foot.

269
00:47:27,825 --> 00:47:28,814
Excuse me?

270
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:30,656
I just want your foot.

271
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:15,025
You think I'm hot?

272
00:49:31,081 --> 00:49:32,514
Like it?

273
00:49:33,851 --> 00:49:35,614
Feels good?

274
00:49:48,265 --> 00:49:50,665
Go to hell.

275
00:50:32,976 --> 00:50:34,534
Mehran!

276
00:50:37,981 --> 00:50:40,347
We've missed you, man.

277
00:50:40,384 --> 00:50:44,787
There is a killer afterparty.

278
00:50:50,627 --> 00:50:55,496
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

279
00:50:55,566 --> 00:50:58,626
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

280
00:50:58,702 --> 00:51:02,069
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

281
00:51:02,139 --> 00:51:05,404
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

282
00:51:05,476 --> 00:51:08,172
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

283
00:51:09,813 --> 00:51:12,441
Shireen! Get down!

284
00:51:34,538 --> 00:51:36,665
Oh, my God, are you okay?

285
00:51:36,707 --> 00:51:39,005
Hossein, let's dub those scenes.

286
00:51:47,484 --> 00:51:49,679
That was awesome.

287
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,712
Fuck the mothers of all the mullahs

288
00:51:52,756 --> 00:51:54,747
who shit all over this country.

289
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,593
To Hollywood!

290
00:52:09,977 --> 00:52:12,912
Where's your energy? Dance.

291
00:52:16,784 --> 00:52:18,411
Are you OK?

292
00:52:18,452 --> 00:52:20,943
Don't tell me what to do.

293
00:52:37,138 --> 00:52:40,107
Morality Police!
Morality Police!

294
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:43,471
Morality Police.

295
00:52:43,511 --> 00:52:45,502
- Hurry!
- Shireen!

296
00:52:46,847 --> 00:52:48,747
Go! Go!

297
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:06,658
Thank God you got away too.

298
00:53:28,022 --> 00:53:30,013
I haven't done anything.

299
00:53:30,057 --> 00:53:31,285
Mehran.

300
00:53:31,325 --> 00:53:33,088
Please, tell him.

301
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,024
Don't be afraid.

302
00:53:40,067 --> 00:53:42,399
We have nothing against you.

303
00:53:46,107 --> 00:53:47,404
Ali, my dear.

304
00:53:53,581 --> 00:53:56,277
You piece of shit.

305
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:58,251
You worthless trash.

306
00:53:58,286 --> 00:54:00,220
Always the same mistakes.

307
00:55:11,659 --> 00:55:14,594
I have homework to do.
Let's eat.

308
00:55:17,164 --> 00:55:19,359
Let's wait for your big brother.

309
00:55:26,507 --> 00:55:30,341
Thank you for the feast, Mom.

310
00:55:40,521 --> 00:55:42,011
Is there any more breast?

311
00:55:44,525 --> 00:55:46,288
Wait.

312
00:56:02,042 --> 00:56:03,441
Here you go.

313
00:56:23,063 --> 00:56:25,031
Azar,

314
00:56:25,065 --> 00:56:28,626
don't you think the boy
has become strange?

315
00:56:29,904 --> 00:56:31,269
No,

316
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,398
not at all.

317
00:56:37,912 --> 00:56:39,402
Didn't you want breast?

318
00:56:43,117 --> 00:56:45,585
Is it because I used my hands?

319
00:56:47,755 --> 00:56:51,350
What? You think I'm dirty?

320
00:56:53,594 --> 00:56:56,563
I pray, so I know I'm clean.

321
00:56:56,597 --> 00:56:58,428
You, I'm not so sure of.

322
00:57:06,106 --> 00:57:08,540
Oh, you found some.

323
00:57:08,576 --> 00:57:10,271
Thank you, Mommy.

324
00:57:15,883 --> 00:57:17,043
Pig.

325
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:45,477
I know you're angry.

326
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:51,313
I'm angry too.

327
00:57:51,352 --> 00:57:52,114
Cut. Joey...

328
00:57:52,152 --> 00:57:54,712
That was good but...

329
00:57:54,755 --> 00:57:58,020
make his voice more gay.

330
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:00,356
More gay. Could you do that?

331
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:01,190
More gay?

332
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:02,855
Yes, please. More gay.

333
00:58:02,897 --> 00:58:04,888
OK.

334
00:58:04,932 --> 00:58:05,921
Action!

335
00:58:13,774 --> 00:58:14,798
I know you're angry.

336
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:17,944
I'm angry too.

337
00:58:17,978 --> 00:58:19,138
OK, cut.

338
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:22,208
Joey, he's gay.

339
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:23,910
But not that gay.

340
00:58:23,951 --> 00:58:25,077
Get lost.

341
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,314
OK, OK. Let's do it again.

342
00:58:27,354 --> 00:58:28,343
Action.

343
00:58:31,525 --> 00:58:34,494
I know you're angry.

344
00:58:38,699 --> 00:58:40,394
I'm angry too.

345
00:58:42,703 --> 00:58:44,603
Let's march the streets
of San Francisco

346
00:58:44,638 --> 00:58:46,868
and share our anger.

347
01:00:07,955 --> 01:00:09,547
Yes. Who's your Daddy?

348
01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:11,279
Yeah.

349
01:00:12,226 --> 01:00:13,454
Oh! Say my name.

350
01:00:14,862 --> 01:00:16,090
OK, kids, cut. Cut.

351
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:18,257
Cut. Cut! Cut!

352
01:00:18,298 --> 01:00:20,425
Cut.

353
01:00:20,467 --> 01:00:23,595
Joey, less.
Guys aren't that loud.

354
01:00:23,637 --> 01:00:25,901
Shireen, breathe more.
Exhale.

355
01:00:25,939 --> 01:00:27,372
It's not a Lamaze class.

356
01:00:27,408 --> 01:00:29,376
You're not giving birth.

357
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:32,038
Yeah. OK. Action!

358
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:46,355
I love your body.

359
01:00:51,065 --> 01:00:54,466
Yeah, again.

360
01:00:54,501 --> 01:00:55,900
Your left hand.

361
01:00:55,936 --> 01:00:57,267
Cut. Cut.

362
01:01:01,341 --> 01:01:03,036
Fuck me.

363
01:01:03,077 --> 01:01:04,544
Will you fuck me?

364
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:06,337
Fuck me.

365
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:08,746
- Yeah.
- Fuck me.

366
01:01:08,782 --> 01:01:10,147
Yeah.

367
01:01:13,187 --> 01:01:14,620
Cut! Cut!

368
01:01:14,655 --> 01:01:16,680
Cut, cut, cut!

369
01:01:16,724 --> 01:01:19,625
OK, Joey, please,
let me direct.

370
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:20,752
There's one director now.

371
01:01:23,197 --> 01:01:25,825
Why are you making donkey sounds?

372
01:01:25,866 --> 01:01:28,664
Ladies here don't make those sounds.

373
01:01:28,702 --> 01:01:31,694
Maybe you just don't know
how to produce them.

374
01:01:55,662 --> 01:01:58,859
From now on,
my name is Samantha.

375
01:02:01,068 --> 01:02:03,161
Tonight, you're going to fuck me.

376
01:02:03,203 --> 01:02:06,832
- Fuck me.
- Fuck me.

377
01:02:06,874 --> 01:02:08,341
Fuck me.

378
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:10,366
Why won't you fuck me?

379
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:11,707
Yeah, baby.

380
01:02:11,779 --> 01:02:14,009
Yeah, baby.

381
01:02:37,204 --> 01:02:39,229
Get her.

382
01:02:39,273 --> 01:02:42,800
Pull over.

383
01:02:53,453 --> 01:02:55,978
Don't be afraid, my child.

384
01:02:56,023 --> 01:02:59,254
You're not responsible
for your parents' mistakes.

385
01:02:59,293 --> 01:03:05,630
Is it true your parents were writers?

386
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:08,134
Anti-revolutionary writers?

387
01:03:09,803 --> 01:03:11,600
Face the wall, you whore.

388
01:03:11,638 --> 01:03:13,697
You have no right to look at us.
Understand?

389
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,833
Answer his question.

390
01:03:16,643 --> 01:03:18,474
These tactics might work
with your clients,

391
01:03:18,512 --> 01:03:21,447
but they don't work here.

392
01:03:21,481 --> 01:03:23,312
Answer his question.

393
01:03:24,017 --> 01:03:27,350
My parents were professors.

394
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:30,652
Do you think you can avenge
their deaths by doing this?

395
01:03:32,826 --> 01:03:35,522
Is my brother telling a joke?

396
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:39,521
Hung from a rope,
you won't be laughing.

397
01:04:00,187 --> 01:04:04,954
You know in these cases
of anti-government activity,

398
01:04:04,992 --> 01:04:10,931
we're forced to do
a complete physical examination.

399
01:04:13,233 --> 01:04:15,793
With what right?
You had no such permission.

400
01:04:15,836 --> 01:04:18,999
We don't need your permission.

401
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:21,166
Especially you,
who can't control his daughter.

402
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:23,039
Do you know who you're talking to?

403
01:04:23,076 --> 01:04:26,512
You're not in a position
to play that card.

404
01:04:29,149 --> 01:04:30,707
Please, take a seat.

405
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:43,857
Why is it

406
01:04:45,165 --> 01:04:49,568
your 16-year-old daughter
is not a virgin, but...

407
01:04:49,603 --> 01:04:52,367
Know your place.

408
01:04:52,406 --> 01:04:55,136
Money brings power, I know.

409
01:04:55,175 --> 01:04:58,042
But you're not responsible enough

410
01:04:58,078 --> 01:04:59,670
to control your own daughter.

411
01:05:21,601 --> 01:05:23,694
I once had a daughter too.

412
01:05:25,205 --> 01:05:26,832
God rest her soul.

413
01:05:28,108 --> 01:05:29,735
She's not dead.

414
01:05:29,776 --> 01:05:32,074
She's alive.

415
01:05:32,112 --> 01:05:34,273
She lives on the other side
of the ocean.

416
01:05:36,616 --> 01:05:38,243
But for me, she is dead.

417
01:05:47,127 --> 01:05:50,927
Raising a daughter
is difficult, I know.

418
01:05:50,964 --> 01:05:52,625
It costs so much.

419
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:54,792
Yes, a lot.

420
01:05:58,205 --> 01:06:00,571
So we understand each other.

421
01:06:11,318 --> 01:06:12,717
Completely.

422
01:06:14,988 --> 01:06:16,979
How much to forget this?

423
01:06:18,859 --> 01:06:21,760
We're all forced to play this game.

424
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:26,492
You should be ashamed.

425
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:34,836
You're all garbage, filthy whores.

426
01:06:36,309 --> 01:06:37,936
Answer me.

427
01:06:39,012 --> 01:06:41,139
Answer me.

428
01:06:41,181 --> 01:06:43,649
Are you deaf or dumb?

429
01:06:43,683 --> 01:06:46,743
And you call yourself an actress?

430
01:06:46,787 --> 01:06:49,255
You think, because of
who your father is,

431
01:06:49,289 --> 01:06:52,656
you can do whatever you want?

432
01:06:52,692 --> 01:06:54,387
Where is Shireen?

433
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:39,231
Shireen, do you need a ride home?

434
01:07:39,272 --> 01:07:41,763
My uncle is coming
with the deed to his house.

435
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:44,174
A generous uncle.

436
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:53,344
Sister, your parents are here.

437
01:07:53,386 --> 01:07:55,650
Fix your headscarf.

438
01:07:55,689 --> 01:07:57,122
Good girl.

439
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:09,534
I'll stay with you,

440
01:08:09,569 --> 01:08:11,935
until your uncle comes.

441
01:08:12,939 --> 01:08:14,964
He is going to kill me.

442
01:08:26,453 --> 01:08:28,751
What's so funny?

443
01:08:33,059 --> 01:08:36,119
You can go.
I took care of everything.

444
01:08:38,465 --> 01:08:39,796
How?

445
01:08:43,637 --> 01:08:46,105
I could do something,

446
01:08:46,139 --> 01:08:49,108
so it all disappears
from your record.

447
01:08:49,142 --> 01:08:51,872
And you won't even
have to go to court.

448
01:09:00,921 --> 01:09:03,048
My face is burning.

449
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,256
So damn hot in here.

450
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,388
Not as hot as hell.

451
01:09:27,681 --> 01:09:29,649
Atafeh, this time,

452
01:09:29,683 --> 01:09:31,344
I'll forgive you.

453
01:09:32,252 --> 01:09:35,278
We're all human.
We make mistakes.

454
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:39,653
But if we repeat the same mistakes,

455
01:09:39,693 --> 01:09:42,059
then we're no different than animals.

456
01:09:44,164 --> 01:09:47,759
After months of investigation,

457
01:09:47,801 --> 01:09:51,328
the Revolutionary Guards
were able to infiltrate

458
01:09:51,371 --> 01:09:54,636
a secret anti-government
political cell...

459
01:09:56,343 --> 01:09:57,742
Shireen.

460
01:09:59,546 --> 01:10:01,537
Now you must get married.

461
01:10:01,581 --> 01:10:04,015
No more discussion.
That's that.

462
01:10:05,652 --> 01:10:10,316
The leader of the spies
is Hossein Shekarkhar,

463
01:10:10,357 --> 01:10:11,824
born in Ohio

464
01:10:11,858 --> 01:10:14,827
and a Harvard University student.

465
01:10:14,861 --> 01:10:18,456
Using his dual citizenship
as a guise,

466
01:10:18,498 --> 01:10:21,899
he was able to conduct
his covert spying operation

467
01:10:21,935 --> 01:10:26,201
sponsored by the American
and lsraeli governments.

468
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:29,072
This dangerous American spy

469
01:10:29,109 --> 01:10:33,512
is set to stand trial
at the Freedom Courts.

470
01:10:45,425 --> 01:10:48,417
Hurry. A five-hour hike
is no joke.

471
01:10:48,461 --> 01:10:49,587
Yes, Doctor.

472
01:11:05,078 --> 01:11:08,275
I have guests today,
I need your help.

473
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:23,257
Look at the beautiful blossoms.

474
01:11:23,296 --> 01:11:26,197
You never used to be this slow!

475
01:11:26,232 --> 01:11:28,200
Respect your elders!

476
01:11:28,234 --> 01:11:31,567
I'll show you.

477
01:11:36,509 --> 01:11:39,501
You think you can beat me?

478
01:11:44,684 --> 01:11:50,452
Let's take a tiny break here.

479
01:11:59,332 --> 01:12:01,163
Like it?

480
01:12:05,505 --> 01:12:07,029
Have some water.

481
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:09,064
Save it for yourself.

482
01:12:09,109 --> 01:12:11,907
I have plenty.

483
01:12:11,945 --> 01:12:14,812
Don't squander it
on an old man.

484
01:12:14,848 --> 01:12:17,681
Just have some, Daddy.

485
01:12:17,717 --> 01:12:20,880
I used to come here during college.

486
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:24,583
When we weren't protesting
in the streets,

487
01:12:24,624 --> 01:12:28,856
we would rip off our clothes
and jump in the water.

488
01:12:28,895 --> 01:12:32,991
We'd create such a ruckus.

489
01:12:33,032 --> 01:12:36,331
The park ranger
would chase us with his baton.

490
01:12:36,369 --> 01:12:38,132
"You bastards!"

491
01:12:38,171 --> 01:12:42,437
We would grab our stuff
and run buck naked to our car.

492
01:12:45,678 --> 01:12:48,146
I was once rebellious.

493
01:12:48,181 --> 01:12:50,741
I know what it means to be young.

494
01:12:50,917 --> 01:12:52,680
Are you done?

495
01:12:54,554 --> 01:12:58,012
God, see how she
treats her father?

496
01:12:58,057 --> 01:13:00,025
What's God got to do with it?

497
01:13:00,059 --> 01:13:02,289
Don't be disrespectful.

498
01:13:02,328 --> 01:13:05,263
You all created this world for us

499
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:08,859
with that revolution of yours.

500
01:13:08,902 --> 01:13:11,268
Now we're forced to live
under these circumstances.

501
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:15,365
Have I done so wrong?

502
01:13:15,408 --> 01:13:18,343
I've done all this because of you.

503
01:13:34,427 --> 01:13:37,225
What's gotten into you?

504
01:13:37,263 --> 01:13:39,356
You have everything at your disposal.

505
01:13:39,399 --> 01:13:41,833
If you think somewhere else
is better, go!

506
01:13:41,868 --> 01:13:46,999
If you're tired, go back.
I'll continue alone.

507
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,373
Rush up, rush down.
Rush up, rush down.

508
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:52,537
What's the point?

509
01:13:52,579 --> 01:13:55,946
It's exercise,
it's good for your heart.

510
01:14:01,521 --> 01:14:04,922
You know what's good
for my heart?

511
01:14:04,958 --> 01:14:06,482
Being with my daughter.

512
01:14:07,794 --> 01:14:10,456
You're getting sentimental
in your old age.

513
01:14:19,239 --> 01:14:20,638
Ready?

514
01:14:22,976 --> 01:14:25,410
Why don't you go on ahead?

515
01:14:25,445 --> 01:14:29,643
Like you suggested,
I'll go home.

516
01:14:32,318 --> 01:14:33,808
Are you sure, Dad?

517
01:14:38,925 --> 01:14:40,517
Are you sure?

518
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,256
Yes, I am sure.

519
01:14:43,296 --> 01:14:44,763
At least, take the water.

520
01:14:44,797 --> 01:14:46,230
No need.

521
01:14:46,266 --> 01:14:49,929
- Daddy.
- Go, Atie.

522
01:16:23,563 --> 01:16:25,497
Why didn't you tell me?

523
01:16:26,766 --> 01:16:29,826
Nothing has happened.
They're here to talk.

524
01:17:06,472 --> 01:17:08,702
I just don't understand.

525
01:17:08,741 --> 01:17:11,369
She's ruining herself.

526
01:17:12,512 --> 01:17:13,604
Mehran, out.

527
01:17:15,148 --> 01:17:17,082
- Out.
- I'm going.

528
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:26,119
Why did you get me out?

529
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:28,059
Should we have left you there?

530
01:17:28,094 --> 01:17:30,892
You don't even know what it means
to be in a place like that.

531
01:17:30,930 --> 01:17:33,364
You're not a child anymore.

532
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:35,799
Stop these games.

533
01:17:35,835 --> 01:17:38,395
I didn't raise you like this.

534
01:17:50,283 --> 01:17:52,843
Don't get caught up
in these things.

535
01:17:56,355 --> 01:17:59,222
At least do something of worth.

536
01:18:03,196 --> 01:18:05,721
Sometimes,

537
01:18:05,765 --> 01:18:07,858
we have to accept our reality.

538
01:18:10,169 --> 01:18:13,866
Atafeh, my beautiful little girl.

539
01:18:13,906 --> 01:18:15,100
My sweet baby.

540
01:18:15,141 --> 01:18:21,046
Remember how I used
to sing to you.

541
01:18:55,381 --> 01:18:59,374
With the permission
of my uncle and grandmother,

542
01:19:01,354 --> 01:19:02,218
I accept.

543
01:24:07,927 --> 01:24:09,758
I bought it today.

544
01:24:11,897 --> 01:24:13,194
It's nice.

545
01:24:15,167 --> 01:24:17,658
With the payment
from my first contract,

546
01:24:17,703 --> 01:24:22,299
I will build
a six-bedroom home for me,

547
01:24:22,341 --> 01:24:29,372
Shireen and, God willing,
our children.

548
01:24:36,555 --> 01:24:40,321
Azar, I'm going to Vanak
if you want a ride.

549
01:24:52,271 --> 01:24:54,398
Shireen,

550
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:58,001
can you imagine it?

551
01:24:58,944 --> 01:25:02,072
Imagine here,

552
01:25:02,114 --> 01:25:06,608
huge windows facing the garden.

553
01:25:08,354 --> 01:25:13,815
And here,
we could plant jasmine trees.

554
01:25:16,128 --> 01:25:17,652
Do you like jasmine trees?

555
01:25:22,067 --> 01:25:23,159
What do you like?

556
01:25:23,202 --> 01:25:26,797
Mehran, I haven't talked to Atie
in so long.

557
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:29,803
Can I go with her?

558
01:25:29,842 --> 01:25:32,402
- Sweetheart, no.
- Why?

559
01:25:32,444 --> 01:25:34,878
Atafeh and her friends
got you into trouble.

560
01:25:34,914 --> 01:25:35,938
But Mehran.

561
01:25:35,981 --> 01:25:37,642
Let's go.

562
01:27:09,908 --> 01:27:12,433
I can't do this anymore.

563
01:27:12,478 --> 01:27:15,936
Nothing has changed.

564
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:17,414
I love you.

565
01:27:20,452 --> 01:27:22,852
How can you say that?

566
01:27:39,938 --> 01:27:42,498
Is it better if I were in jail?

567
01:27:42,541 --> 01:27:45,533
Or here with you?

568
01:27:45,577 --> 01:27:48,205
I did this all for you.

569
01:27:57,423 --> 01:28:01,883
Firouz darling,
bring the wine for our guests.

570
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:21,607
I want to play you something.

571
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:19,529
I learned this dish at Berkeley.

572
01:29:19,571 --> 01:29:21,903
Very, very special.

573
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:28,473
OK.

574
01:29:28,514 --> 01:29:32,382
Mehran, Atafeh.
A song for your mother.

575
01:29:32,418 --> 01:29:34,682
No,

576
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:38,383
Shireen wrote a lovely new song

577
01:29:38,424 --> 01:29:41,188
that she must perform for us.

578
01:29:41,226 --> 01:29:42,921
Sing it for us, my dear.

579
01:29:42,961 --> 01:29:46,556
Shireen is talented, isn't she?

580
01:29:47,466 --> 01:29:50,833
Absolutely,
talented and beautiful.

581
01:29:54,072 --> 01:29:56,939
But I don't like my wife
singing in public.

582
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:03,980
But it's just us here.

583
01:30:04,016 --> 01:30:07,543
Still, I don't want my wife to sing.

584
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:09,749
You're ridiculous.

585
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:14,588
Atafeh shouldn't sing either.

586
01:30:14,626 --> 01:30:16,560
Mehran.

587
01:30:16,595 --> 01:30:19,291
But that's up to you.

588
01:30:19,331 --> 01:30:23,267
You control your daughter,
I'll control my wife.

589
01:30:24,536 --> 01:30:27,630
Have you become a fanatic?
Going to turn us all in tonight?

590
01:30:29,775 --> 01:30:32,471
It's not a concert,
it's family and friends.

591
01:30:32,511 --> 01:30:36,106
Atafeh and I will sing.

592
01:33:15,607 --> 01:33:18,440
"l can't do this anymore."

593
01:33:25,150 --> 01:33:27,482
"l love you.

594
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:29,111
Nothing has changed."

595
01:33:32,290 --> 01:33:34,224
"How can you say that?"

596
01:33:40,132 --> 01:33:41,690
"How can you say that?"

597
01:33:43,068 --> 01:33:45,468
"ls it better if I were in jail,
or here with you?

598
01:33:45,504 --> 01:33:47,495
I did this all for you."

599
01:34:21,673 --> 01:34:24,301
Why can't I be enough?

600
01:34:25,210 --> 01:34:30,113
Why can't I be enough?

601
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,467
Mr. Tabrizi?

602
01:38:11,736 --> 01:38:13,863
Visa and ticket for Dubai.

603
01:38:13,905 --> 01:38:17,397
Father's permission
stamped in your passport?

604
01:38:32,958 --> 01:38:35,358
Tonight at nine.

605
01:39:31,816 --> 01:39:33,147
What's wrong?

606
01:39:36,688 --> 01:39:41,785
What's wrong, Shireen?

607
01:39:41,826 --> 01:39:49,631
What's wrong? We're alone.

608
01:39:49,667 --> 01:39:51,635
We're alone today.

609
01:39:52,670 --> 01:39:55,161
What's wrong with you?

610
01:39:55,206 --> 01:39:57,299
Are you afraid?

611
01:39:57,342 --> 01:39:58,809
What are you afraid of?

612
01:39:58,843 --> 01:40:01,835
Are you afraid of this?

613
01:40:10,522 --> 01:40:15,824
Is that it, Shireen,
you afraid of this?

614
01:40:15,860 --> 01:40:18,021
Is that what you're afraid of?

615
01:40:21,132 --> 01:40:23,532
Why?

616
01:41:33,404 --> 01:41:35,304
We can leave.

617
01:41:36,305 --> 01:42:36,851

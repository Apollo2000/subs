2
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,509
...so surprised
when he saw all those presents

3
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,299
under the Christmas tree,
and she was one of them.

4
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,179
Now, this house was originally owned
by Herbert Flackshaw,

5
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,519
who started this tradition
on Candy Cane Lane.

6
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,939
He even hired his nephew Otis
to play Santa Claus for many years,

7
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,729
until he was arrested
for child endangerment in 1992.

8
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,229
Ooh, you guys got to look at this house.

9
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,649
This house is the site...

10
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,650
Are you having fun?

11
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,989
‐ Are you having fun?

12
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,909
Yes, I think this is cute.

13
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,329
‐ It is. Yeah.

14
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,539
‐ Oh, God, you hate it.

15
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,329
No, I don't hate it.

16
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,249
Baby, I'm just not
a huge Christmas person.

17
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,459
I know, I know, but...

18
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,999
How can you not like the lights
and the decorations

19
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,799
and the Christmas trees?

20
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,089
‐ Fun fact: did you know
that Christmas trees are responsible

21
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,219
for an annual average of four deaths,

22
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,269
15 injuries

23
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,689
and a loss of $12 million?

24
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,399
Okay, I get it.

25
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,229
I think you made your point.

26
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,269
Thank you for trying to get me
to like Christmas.

27
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,729
I love that you love it.

28
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,819
I'm just so content taking care
of other people's pets

29
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,529
when they're away for the holiday‐‐

30
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,950
Come with me.

31
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,450
‐ Wait, where are we going?

32
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,999
Do you know these people?

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What are you doing?
‐ No. Come here.

34
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,089
Still not clear on the plan.

35
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,589
‐ Will you shut up and follow me, please?

36
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,549
Come on.

37
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,610
Well, does this do anything for you?

38
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,910
‐ This is beautiful.

39
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,989
I hate that you're gonna
be alone on Christmas.

40
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,829
I'm gonna miss you.

41
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,829
‐ Hey, I'm gonna miss you, too.

42
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,790
‐ We could just stay up here.

43
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,800
I'd do that.

44
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,879
Hey! I hear you up there.

45
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,219
I'm calling the police.

46
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,679
Um...

47
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,719
‐ Abby?
‐ Harper!

48
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,229
Oh, my God.

49
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,979
Are you okay?
‐ Um...

50
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,309
I don't know. Uh, what do I do?

51
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,269
‐ Stay there. I'm gonna get you down.

52
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,729
‐ Okay. Yeah.

53
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,610
‐ Shit.
‐ Uh...

54
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,449
Oh.

55
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,109
What are you doing out there?

56
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,909
‐ Harper!
‐ Are you peeping?

57
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,489
Don't you peep at me.

58
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,579
Oh, God!

59
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,869
Abby?

60
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,619
‐ Oh, my God. Are you okay?

61
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,209
‐ I'm so great.

62
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,789
‐ Here, here. Yeah, yeah, come on.

63
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,999
We got to go. Come on.

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,209
She's coming. Go. Run.
‐ Oh. Hey.

65
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,629
Yeah, you better run.

66
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,299
Pervert.

67
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,299
‐ Who said you could come downstairs?

68
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,969
Giddyap.

69
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,989
Come with me.

70
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,539
‐ Where?

71
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,119
‐ To my parents' house for Christmas.

72
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,749
‐ Oh, really?

73
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,669
I've got the pets to sit.

74
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,459
‐ Oh, my God, get someone
to cover for you.

75
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,669
I want to...

76
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,339
wake up with you on Christmas morning.

77
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,389
And if that doesn't
convince you to love Christmas,

78
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,390
I'll never bring it up again.

79
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,889
‐ Deal.

80
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,810
Yeah.
‐ Mm.

81
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,559
‐ Hi.

82
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,769
‐ Hey.

83
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,939
Sit down.

84
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,069
‐ What's going on in here?

85
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,739
‐ I just woke up thinking about
going home with you and got...

86
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,699
very excited about Christmas.

87
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,079
‐ Oh... baby, you don't‐‐
You don't have to come with me.

88
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,249
‐ Well, I want to.
‐ No.

89
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,039
No, no, no, no, I‐‐

90
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,209
I feel like I really put you
on the spot last night,

91
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,749
and I understand how you feel
about Christmas

92
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,839
because you lost your parents,
and you just don't have‐‐

93
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,969
‐ No, no, no, I‐I genuinely want to go.

94
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,879
‐ Uh‐huh.

95
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,929
‐ I get to go meet the people
that made my favorite person.

96
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,639
‐ Okay.

97
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,389
But who's gonna look after all those pets?

98
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,390
‐ John's gonna cover for me.

99
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,069
I know why you're worried.

100
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,189
But don't be.

101
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,359
I'm all in on Christmas.

102
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,989
‐ Hmm?
‐ Good.

103
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,580
Yeah.

104
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,329
So, for the cat,
you can go every other day,

105
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,459
but the dog and the fish need
to be seen morning and night.

106
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,879
‐ Mm‐hmm. Okay.
‐ Oh, and the apartment on Butler

107
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,749
has this weird lock, so if you jiggle it,

108
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,919
it will lock, but you have to
make sure that you do that.

109
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,709
‐ Yes.
‐ What are you doing on your phone?

110
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,259
‐ I'm sorry, I left a gentleman
alone in my apartment,

111
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,259
so I'm tracking him
to make sure he leaves.

112
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,179
‐ You're tracking him?
‐ Yeah. I track everybody.

113
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,599
If the NSA can do it, so can I.

114
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,270
And he's gone.
Sorry, what were you saying?

115
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,769
‐ I wrote it all down.

116
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,269
They're really specific directions,

117
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,109
but if you need anything,
you can obviously call me.

118
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,319
‐ Abigail, don't worry.

119
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,399
I'm responsible for the careers
of dozens of authors.

120
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,069
I am more than capable of taking care
of a few pets for two days.

121
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,199
‐ It's... it's five days.

122
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
‐ Five days. That's what I said.

123
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
‐ Refill?
‐ Hi.

124
00:08:35,201 --> 00:08:38,369
And I sort of think I made
the right decision, but at the same time‐‐

125
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,579
‐ What is Ultrasuede?

126
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,829
‐ Ultrasuede is, like,
a water‐resistant fabric.

127
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,249
‐ Hello.

128
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,789
‐ What are we doing here?

129
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,249
‐ Hi. Can I help you?

130
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,919
‐ Yeah, I'm picking up.
My name's Abby Holland.

131
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,759
‐ Oh, yes, of course.
Um, just wait right here.

132
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,929
I'll be right back.
Oh, enjoy some champagne.

133
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,719
‐ Oh.

134
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,849
Thank you.

135
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,720
I love champagne.

136
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,640
‐ Here we are.

137
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,850
May I?
‐ Yeah, of course. Thanks.

138
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,439
There it is.

139
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,070
‐ No.

140
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,699
Abby, you and Harper have
a perfect relationship.

141
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,489
Why do you want to ruin that

142
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,909
by engaging in one of
the most archaic institutions

143
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,119
in the history of the human race?

144
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,869
‐ Because I want to marry her.

145
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,669
‐ Okay, you say that,
but what you're actually doing

146
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,919
is tricking the woman you claim to love

147
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,459
by trapping her in a box
of heteronormativity

148
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,339
and trying to make her your property.

149
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,799
She is not a rice cooker or a cake plate.

150
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,179
She's a human being.

151
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,559
‐ No, it's not about owning her.

152
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,099
It's about building a life with her.

153
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,690
She is my person,
and I really want everyone to know that.

154
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,109
‐ I suppose that's one way
of looking at it.

155
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,110
So, when are you gonna ask her?

156
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,609
‐ I was thinking of doing it
on New Year's,

157
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,739
but now that I'm going home with her...

158
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,779
I understand this is very old‐fashioned,

159
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,869
but I'm probably gonna ask
her dad for his blessing

160
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,870
and propose on Christmas morning.

161
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,999
‐ I'm sorry, ask her dad for his blessing?

162
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,209
Way to stick it to the patriarchy.

163
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,179
Really well done.

164
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,359
God, I'm so excited.

165
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,479
I can't believe I'm finally
gonna meet everyone.

166
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,279
I mean, I haven't had
a family Christmas in ten years.

167
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,699
Also, a fact you don't know about me:

168
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,449
I am actually very good with parents.

169
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,159
‐ Okay, there's something
that we should talk about

170
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,749
before we get to my parents' house.

171
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,829
‐ What is it?

172
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,829
‐ Do you remember this summer

173
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:53,049
when I came out to my parents
and told them we were together

174
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,259
and they took it really well?

175
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,969
‐ Yeah.

176
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,389
‐ Okay, well, that wasn't
entirely accurate.

177
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,809
‐ They didn't take it well?

178
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,849
‐ No. No, no.

179
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,349
Um...

180
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,360
I didn't tell them.

181
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,149
I was going to, and then Dad told us

182
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,949
that he was running for mayor,

183
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,279
and it just didn't feel
like the right time,

184
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,119
and then now he's trying to get
the support of this donor,

185
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,579
and our whole Christmas is
about impressing this person,

186
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,709
which is stressing my mom out
even more than usual, and I just‐‐

187
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,079
I know that if I tell them now,

188
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,419
their reaction is gonna be colored
by all this other stress,

189
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,919
and I‐I'm sorry,
I don't think that's fair.

190
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,669
To you or to us.

191
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,339
‐ Then why did you invite me?

192
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,759
‐ Because we were just having
such a special night, and...

193
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,599
and, fine, I got carried away,
but it's because I love you

194
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,269
and‐and I want to give you
such a great Christmas.

195
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,689
‐ You're off to a really great start.

196
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:54,859
‐ I'm so sorry.

197
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,899
‐ So, who do they think I am?

198
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,359
‐ My roommate.

199
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,319
‐ They don't think it's weird
that you're bringing

200
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,069
your roommate home for Christmas?

201
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,829
‐ No, because I told them that
you had nowhere else to go

202
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,909
because your parents
are no longer with us.

203
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,249
‐ I'm not going.

204
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,249
‐ Look, this is actually
a really good opportunity

205
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:19,509
for them to see how amazing
and kind and smart you are.

206
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,509
You said it yourself,
you're great with parents,

207
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,549
so they're gonna meet you,
they're gonna fall in love with you,

208
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,810
and then that'll make it so much easier
when I do tell them.

209
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,690
Look...

210
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,149
I get it, okay?

211
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,239
I am asking a lot of you.

212
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,909
But I promise I will tell them everything

213
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,910
after the holidays.

214
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,170
‐ Okay, we can do this.

215
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,919
It's five days.

216
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,759
How bad can it be?

217
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,189
Should I have some sort
of cover story or something?

218
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,359
Oh, no, no.

219
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,979
Just be you.
‐ Okay.

220
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,729
‐ I mean, but don't, you know,

221
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,319
say that we're together,
obviously, and, um...

222
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,699
you know, maybe don't mention
that you're, um...

223
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,239
‐ Gay?
‐ Yeah.

224
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,159
Yeah, I think, actually,
it might be better just to avoid it.

225
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,459
But don't lie.

226
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,419
You're a very bad liar.

227
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,670
‐ No, I'm not.

228
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,629
‐ Hi!
‐ Hi.

229
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,129
‐ Wait.

230
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,509
Mom, what are you doing?

231
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,259
‐ I started an Instagram feed

232
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,059
for your father to give voters
a peek behind the curtain.

233
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,849
Your mother's going viral!

234
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,599
Hi!

235
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,189
Aw.

236
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,149
‐ Look at you.

237
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:01,529
You get more and more beautiful
every single time I see you.

238
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,949
Mom, stop.

239
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,449
‐ Did you bring concealer?

240
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,159
‐ Yeah. This is Abby.

241
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,579
‐ Hi, Abby.

242
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,199
It is so nice to meet you.

243
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,619
‐ It's so nice to meet you, too.

244
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,869
Thank you for having me here.

245
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,289
‐ It is nothing.

246
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,669
Harper's father and I are always happy
to open our doors to those in need.

247
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,089
‐ Where is Dad?

248
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,459
‐ Uh, he's on a call.
‐ Oh, okay. Well‐‐

249
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,169
Harper!

250
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,429
Oh, Jane.

251
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,179
Oh, I have asked you not to do that.

252
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,679
‐ I know. I didn't listen.

253
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,509
- Oh. Yay!
- Oh.

254
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,269
I didn't think you'd be here,
but here you are.

255
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,849
‐ Oh, I didn't want to wait
one more second

256
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,229
to see my little sis.
‐ Oh, what's this?

257
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,769
‐ Oh, I was changing the air filters.
‐ It's sticky.

258
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,769
‐ Thank you, Jane.

259
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,479
‐ Yeah, hi. You must be Abby.

260
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,239
‐ Yeah. Nice to meet you.
‐ You, too.

261
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,860
Um...

262
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,069
I'm so sorry about your parents.

263
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,489
Oh, no.

264
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,490
‐ Uh, it‐it ha‐‐
It happened a long time ago.

265
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,459
‐ You're so brave.

266
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,959
- Oh.
- You don't need to be.

267
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,419
‐ Jane.
‐ Mom, can you just‐‐

268
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,959
Okay. That's enough, Jane.

269
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,549
‐ Jane, too much. Too much.
‐ You're always safe with‐‐

270
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,129
‐ So, this is our living room.

271
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,009
‐ Wow, that's a beautiful piano.

272
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,339
‐ Isn't it?

273
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,389
Of course, I wish
my daughters had bothered

274
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,559
to learn to play it,
but it does look nice.

275
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,519
‐ I took lessons for eight years.

276
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,189
And this is the den.

277
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,019
‐ You're sure Harry will be there
tomorrow night, right?

278
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,059
Perfect.

279
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,729
Oh, uh, Carolyn, I'll call you later.

280
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,359
My daughter just arrived.

281
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,189
There she is, my perfect girl.

282
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,319
‐ Hi, Dad.
‐ Oh, look at you.

283
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,909
Oh!

284
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,329
‐ Hi, Dad.
‐ Jane, glad you're here.

285
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,619
The Internet has been a little spotty.

286
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,619
‐ Ugh, not again.

287
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,249
‐ Oh, and this is Harper's orphan friend.

288
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,999
‐ Oh.
‐ This is Abby.

289
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,749
‐ Yes, of course.
‐ Hey, sir.

290
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,379
Terrible.

291
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,509
There, there.

292
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,299
Harper, I read your piece
about that senator.

293
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,719
He's got to resign, right?

294
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,509
Yeah, I think it's just a matter of time.

295
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,969
‐ That was a good piece.
‐ Aw.

296
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:54,970
Thanks, Dad.

297
00:15:54,971 --> 00:15:56,599
‐ You know what was really good?

298
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,979
Um, the speech that you made
at the food bank on Thanksgiving.

299
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,399
‐ Oh, thank you. You‐you know,
that speech wasn't scripted.

300
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,979
I ju‐‐ It just came to me.

301
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,609
‐ You could tell. I mean, you were very‐‐

302
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,439
‐ Okay, enough shoptalk. Let's continue.

303
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,529
‐ Okay. Bye.
‐ See you later.

304
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,069
‐ And this is Sloane's room.

305
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,319
She's my eldest.

306
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,739
‐ That's a lot of trophies.

307
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,079
‐ Yes.

308
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,749
She was brilliant.

309
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,459
She and her husband Eric‐‐

310
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,329
he graduated top of his class at Yale‐‐

311
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,039
were very successful attorneys,

312
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,799
but they gave it all up
to raise their beautiful twins,

313
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,590
and now they make gift baskets.

314
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,679
Which is great.

315
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,139
Mm‐hmm.

316
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,730
What'd I miss?

317
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,769
‐ Wow.

318
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,189
I know, right?

319
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,029
Ugh, is it hot in here,

320
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,779
- or is it just him?
- Okay.

321
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,449
‐ Yummy, yummy, yummy.
‐ Okay.

322
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,779
‐ No. Jane. No.
‐ Num, num.

323
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,289
Mom, I thought you were gonna

324
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,999
turn this room into your office.

325
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,249
‐ Men need offices, dear.

326
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,669
Oh, that is Harper's old
high school boyfriend Connor!

327
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,669
I asked you to put this away.

328
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,549
You know, he's still single.

329
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,509
- Okay, Mom, stop, please.
- Mm.

330
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,259
Do you have a boyfriend, Abby?

331
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,339
‐ No.

332
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,639
But I have.

333
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,719
'Cause... I have had many.

334
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,519
Um, but‐but not too many;
an‐an appropriate amount.

335
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,559
I actually just went through a breakup.

336
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,939
‐ Oh, no.
‐ Abby.

337
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,609
Yeah, with, um...

338
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,189
He was a‐‐ He was a milk... man.

339
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,069
‐ Okay, and I think
we'll just settle in now.

340
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,739
‐ Okay. Well, we'll just
show Abby to her room.

341
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,659
‐ What, is she not gonna
stay up here with me?

342
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,919
‐ Harper, I would never ask
two grown women to share the same bed.

343
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,829
Harper.

344
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,169
‐ No, A‐Abby will stay in Jane's old room.

345
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,629
‐ Oh, oh, I could show it to her.
‐ Okay.

346
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,839
‐ I could take her down. Yeah, let's go.

347
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,179
‐ Settle down.
‐ I'm settled!

348
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,760
Okay.

349
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,309
‐ Oh.

350
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,809
Your room's in the basement.

351
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,309
‐ Oh, yeah. I had night terrors.

352
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:07,649
They put me down here so I wouldn't
wake everyone up.

353
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,940
Behold.

354
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,779
Cool, huh?

355
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,029
‐ It's very cool.

356
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,109
‐ It's my room.

357
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,829
‐ Is everything okay?

358
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,199
‐ Yeah. Yeah. Really good.

359
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,949
‐ No, not you. No.
‐ Oh.

360
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,449
‐ Yeah.
‐ Thank you, Jane.

361
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,039
Why don't you go on home and rest up
a little bit before dinner?

362
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,629
Okay.

363
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,799
Don't have any fun
without me.

364
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,169
‐ Yeah.
‐ Bye.

365
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,509
‐ I'm sorry about all this mess.

366
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,339
‐ What? No, this is so nice.

367
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,929
‐ Better than your room at the orphanage?

368
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,269
‐ Oh, I‐I wasn't in an orphanage,

369
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,979
'cause I‐I was 19 when my parents died.

370
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,229
‐ Oh. One of the lucky ones.

371
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,399
‐ Well...

372
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,309
I'll let you settle in.

373
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,479
We leave for dinner at 6:45.

374
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,689
‐ Okay.

375
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,779
‐ Oh, there's no lock on this door.

376
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,029
We had it removed
because Jane was always scared

377
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,529
that we would lock her in.

378
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,699
But don't worry,
you'll have total privacy.

379
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,499
Okay. Thank you.

380
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,000
‐ Okay.

381
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,760
- Milady.
- Thank you.

382
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,179
Is this all right?

383
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,759
‐ This is perfect, Colleen. Thank you.

384
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,309
‐ Oh, actually, I think we're
gonna need one more chair.

385
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,599
I'll have one brought over.

386
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,309
‐ Oh, who else is joining us?

387
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,059
‐ Hey, guys. How's it going?

388
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,899
‐ Connor!
How funny to see you here.

389
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,149
You told me to be here at 7:00, right?

390
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,769
Shh. Oh, wow. JANE:
Hey. - How you doing?

391
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,359
Great to see you, Connor.

392
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,399
‐ Hey, Ted. How you doing?
‐ Great.

393
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,149
‐ Hi, Connor.
‐ Hi, Jane.

394
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,449
Hi. It's been a minute.
‐ Hi.

395
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,609
‐ How are you?
‐ Yeah. Hey.

396
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,619
‐ Connor, this is Harper's friend Abby.

397
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,239
‐ Oh, hey. Connor.
‐ Hey. ‐ She's an orphan.

398
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,159
‐ Oh, um, I'm so sorry.
‐ Jane.

399
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,409
‐ I‐‐ ‐ What?
‐ What are you doing?

400
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,579
‐ She is.
‐ No, it's‐it's‐‐

401
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,580
‐ It's all we have.

402
00:19:48,581 --> 00:19:49,789
All right.

403
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,419
Thank you. Let's all take a seat.

404
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,009
Do you want to switch?
‐ No.

405
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,179
No, this is perfect.
‐ Okay.

406
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,179
And then in the third chapter,
the Shadow Dreamers

407
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,179
discover that the gemstone
that they thought was inside the gork

408
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,349
was actually stolen by an evil floam,
which is sort of like a maggel

409
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,139
but with less arms and more powers.

410
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,439
‐ Oh, wow.

411
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,859
That's amazing. It really is.

412
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,019
‐ Jane, I just can't believe
you're still working on that book.

413
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,069
It's been like ten years.

414
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,689
‐ Takes a long time to build a world.

415
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,199
‐ You know what I was
thinking about the other day?

416
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,739
I was thinking about that trip

417
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,289
that we took to our old house
in Jackson Hole

418
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,619
- when Harper got chicken pox.
- Oh, yeah.

419
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,829
Oh, God.

420
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,209
‐ Harper told me this story.

421
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,339
‐ Then you must know that
she very quickly gave it to Connor.

422
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,629
Yes, she did.

423
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,129
- Very quickly.
- The two of them

424
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,089
didn't leave the cabin for the whole trip,

425
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,549
‐ if I remember correctly.
No. ‐ Oh, my goodness.

426
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,719
‐ Literally in a cabin running a fever.

427
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,969
‐ Yeah.
‐ Together.

428
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,809
‐ Together. Yep, yep.
‐ Really laughing a lot.

429
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,559
It was ground zero for chicken pox.

430
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,389
Yeah. God, that was fun.
You know, I really,

431
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,939
really loved going on those trips.
‐ Fun.

432
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,809
‐ Well, we loved having you, son.
‐ That was lovely.

433
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,269
‐ Should we go to the ladies' room?

434
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,029
‐ Oh, I‐I would hate to miss
some of these stories.

435
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,110
‐ No, we'll be quick.

436
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,989
I am so sorry.

437
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,949
I had no idea he was gonna be here.

438
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,409
I swear.

439
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,369
‐ It's funny, I remember you
telling me that story.

440
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,209
I think you just forgot
to mention that Connor

441
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,039
‐ was also there.
‐ I know.

442
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,959
I‐I don't know, he didn't seem like
an important part of the story.

443
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,629
Look, I'm gonna talk to my mom,
and I'm gonna make sure that

444
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,470
nothing like this happens
for the rest of the trip, okay?

445
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,139
‐ You can be totally honest with me.

446
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,559
Like, about anything.

447
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,270
Seriously, I can take it.

448
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,020
‐ Okay.

449
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,109
Then you should know that
it is very difficult

450
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,110
to sit next to you at dinner
and not be able to kiss you.

451
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,870
‐ Yeah.

452
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,749
‐ No more surprises.

453
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,370
I promise.

454
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,169
- Riley.
- Mm.

455
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,960
Harper.

456
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,929
‐ Mm. Uh...

457
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,589
‐ Sorry, um...

458
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,099
Riley, this is Abby.

459
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,969
Abby is my‐‐ ‐ Orphan.

460
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,389
Roommate. We‐‐

461
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,349
I am an orphan, but we live together.

462
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,639
As friends, um, like acquaintances.

463
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,399
‐ Oh, please stop.
‐ Yeah.

464
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,109
‐ Nice to meet you.

465
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:20,189
So, I'm just gonna sneak on by you guys.

466
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,399
‐ Oh, God. Sorry.

467
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,320
Sorry. Just...

468
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,949
‐ Was that the Riley?

469
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,029
‐ Okay, that one really wasn't my fault.

470
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,659
‐ Well, who knows, maybe...

471
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,289
maybe another one of your exes
will bring out dessert.

472
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,669
‐ Okay.
‐ Oh, my God.

473
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,749
‐ Harper, did you see
that the Bennetts are here?

474
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,880
Uh...

475
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,009
Yeah. We just ran into Riley.

476
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,929
‐ Did you hear she's doing
her residency at Johns Hopkins?

477
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,799
‐ I should have her look at my mole.

478
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,549
‐ No, um, I hadn't heard that.

479
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,099
‐ It's very impressive.

480
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,809
Her parents must be proud.

481
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,349
And relieved.

482
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,189
‐ I know. That lifestyle choice.

483
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,559
Mm. Such a shame.

484
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,649
‐ Abby, what do you do?

485
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:05,569
‐ Oh, I'm‐I'm working on my PhD
in art history over at Carnegie Mellon.

486
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,239
My parents were professors there,

487
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,699
so I kind of wanted to follow
in their footsteps.

488
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,779
‐ You know, before law school,

489
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,499
I took all the money I had
and went to Paris for a month.

490
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,789
Spent every day in museums.

491
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,579
That experience made me the man I am.

492
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,089
‐ That‐that must have been incredible.

493
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,249
What a dream.

494
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,339
‐ It was.

495
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,879
Boy, Carnegie Mellon, huh?

496
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,799
Bet you could teach me a thing or two.

497
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,259
Should I go over there?

498
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,389
No, darling, no.

499
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,719
I do think it's getting bigger.

500
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,220
- No.
- Stay at the table, Jane.

501
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,649
‐ Oh. You settling in okay?
‐ Hey.

502
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,069
Yeah. Yeah.

503
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,659
You're such a wonderful host,
so I'm great.

504
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,279
‐ Thank you, Abby.

505
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,529
Thank you.

506
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,829
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi, sweetie.

507
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,239
Do you need something?

508
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,199
‐ No, just to say good night to Abby.

509
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,910
‐ Oh.

510
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,249
‐ Mom, do you mind?

511
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,039
Oh.

512
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,799
I get it. Girl talk.

513
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,549
Okay, when you finish, um,

514
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,629
I want to give you
a little early Christmas present.

515
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,839
‐ Ooh, okay.

516
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,430
‐ Night.
‐ Night, Abby.

517
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,479
Tonight wasn't the best.

518
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,059
‐ Yeah.

519
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,609
But we got through it.

520
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,229
‐ You know, you're right.

521
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,229
You are really good with parents.

522
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,939
‐ You think they like me?

523
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,649
‐ Definitely.

524
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:33,699
‐ You think they like me
as much as they love Connor?

525
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,079
‐ Oh, no. No, no.

526
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,449
But they don't even really
like me that much, so...

527
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,119
Oh.

528
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,460
I love you.
‐ I love you.

529
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,680
Stop it.

530
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,049
The hell did it go?

531
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,889
Cheap freaking puzzle.

532
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:02,229
Yeah, Abby, I'm in the middle
of something right now.

533
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,849
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

534
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:04,899
I'm just checking on the animals.

535
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,900
Oh, they're all good.

536
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:07,019
I walked the dog.

537
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,279
Fed him, fed the cats.

538
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,280
- All are well.
- What about the fish?

539
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,859
‐ Uh, the fish are‐‐ Yeah.

540
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,239
The‐the‐the fish are‐are‐‐ Yes. Yeah.

541
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,409
But enough about me.

542
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,410
Have you managed

543
00:25:17,411 --> 00:25:21,959
to get a man's permission to take
ownership of an adult human woman yet?

544
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,369
‐ Not exactly.

545
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,789
‐ What's going on? You sound tense.

546
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,289
No, I'm not tense. I'm great.

547
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,299
There's just one tiny thing.

548
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,960
Um...

549
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,129
Harper isn't out, and her parents
don't know we're together.

550
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:37,299
‐ Okay, you know what,
I always felt like something was off.

551
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,219
You can't go over a year without meeting

552
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,469
your significant other's parents.

553
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,639
Trust me, I have tried.

554
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,059
‐ I know, but it's not that big of a deal,

555
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,399
'cause she does plan on telling them
immediately after the holidays.

556
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,269
‐ So, what, her parents are believing
that their straight daughter

557
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:51,439
brought home her lesbian friend
for Christmas?

558
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,739
No.

559
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,159
No. They also think that I'm...

560
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,279
that I'm straight.

561
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,039
‐ Have they ever met a lesbian?

562
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,329
‐ It's not so bad.

563
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,249
It's kind of fun having a secret.

564
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,869
‐ Yeah, I mean,
there's nothing more erotic

565
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,709
than concealing your authentic selves.

566
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:09,879
‐ I know it's not ideal. I‐‐

567
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,420
But I‐I know that it's what
she needs right now, so...

568
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,139
‐ Who are you?

569
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,229
‐ I'm Abby.

570
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,939
‐ Do you work here?

571
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,569
‐ No, I'm H‐Harper's friend.

572
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,569
Kids?

573
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,149
Where are you?

574
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,149
Hey.

575
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,240
What are you doing in here? Out.

576
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,739
But that's our room.

577
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,289
‐ Sorry about them. I'm Sloane.

578
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:44,119
Why does she get to sleep in there?

579
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,869
‐ Hi. I'm...
‐ Because she's a grown‐up, sweetie.

580
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,539
‐ ...Abby.

581
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,880
Come. We're having breakfast.

582
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,479
‐ Are you tired?

583
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,099
Not me. I like the morning.

584
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,359
But then I have something meaningful
to get out of bed for, so...

585
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,609
Thank you, Mommy.

586
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,109
‐ Snowman pancakes.

587
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,319
God, that's a lot of work for something
that's just gonna turn to shit.

588
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,159
Oh, but that's kind of like
your law degree.

589
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,239
‐ It must be freeing
to be so self‐involved

590
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,239
you don't realize that's actually
not appropriate language

591
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,449
to use in front of children.

592
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,830
We got everything out of the van.

593
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,169
‐ Thank you, honey.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

594
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,249
‐ Oh, this is‐‐
‐ Abby. I'm Eric.

595
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,709
‐ Nice to meet you.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

596
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:36,299
A teaspoon of coconut oil‐‐
add some nice moisture to those hands.

597
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,879
‐ Oh.

598
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,220
Yeah, thank you.

599
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,469
So, you and your sister
are pretty intense.

600
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,849
‐ What do you mean?

601
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,019
‐ Freeze!
‐ Ooh.

602
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,689
‐ Don't move one more muscle
before I hug you!

603
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,439
‐ Hi, Jane.
‐ Oh. Oh, hi.

604
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,899
Oh. Yay.

605
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,949
- Hi, Eric. Hi.
- Hi, Jane.

606
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,819
‐ Hi, you guys. Hi.

607
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,079
Um...

608
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,739
Gosh, you're so big.

609
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,699
What are you, college students?

610
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,159
‐ We're in elementary school.

611
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,289
‐ Yeah. No, I‐I know. I'm just‐‐

612
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,379
You're just so tall, you know?

613
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,920
‐ Here they are.
‐ My babies.

614
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:19,049
Aw...

615
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,089
‐ Hi, Daddy.
‐ Did you get Harper's article I sent you?

616
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,969
- I did.
- Good, right?

617
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,139
‐ Mm. Mm‐hmm. Mm.
‐ Uh‐huh.

618
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,889
‐ Ted.
‐ Eric.

619
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,349
- Good to see you.
- Hi, Mom.

620
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,519
Hi.

621
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,309
‐ Morning.
‐ Morning, Abby.

622
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,859
Hey, girls, come here.
 I'm good. ERIC: Hi.

623
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,309
‐ Just‐just‐just come over here.

624
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,019
- Just move a bit.
- I cannot believe

625
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,279
I've got all my daughters under one roof.

626
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,239
Mm, mm.
‐ This is great content.

627
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,699
‐ Oh.
‐ Hold it. Hold it.

628
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,700
‐ And smile.
‐ Hold on.

629
00:28:43,701 --> 00:28:45,489
Daddy. ‐
Uh‐huh. Uh‐huh. ‐ Got it.

630
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,159
‐ Okay. I got to shower.

631
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,159
Hey, big night tonight, girls.
‐ That's too much.

632
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,829
‐ We're meeting a major donor
at the party.

633
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,669
Harper, I need you to bring your A game.

634
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,749
‐ Got it.
‐ Dad, do you need me to do anything?

635
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,169
‐ Honey, no.

636
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:59,089
You just bring that beautiful family
and show them off.

637
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,509
Who knows?

638
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,799
These might be the only
grandchildren we ever have.

639
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,349
And it is crucial that we take

640
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:08,519
the family holiday photo
for the Instagram tonight,

641
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,229
so don't wear anything
that will strobe, Jane.

642
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,479
Okay.

643
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,569
Who's ready to go ice‐skating?

644
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,779
‐ Are you ready?
‐ No.

645
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,499
‐ Let me know if you guys
need any more room.

646
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,040
I can make myself real small.

647
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,299
‐ So, Sloane and Eric,
you guys make gift baskets, right?

648
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,629
‐ No.

649
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:43,219
We create curated gift experiences

650
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,639
inside of handmade reclaimed wood vessels.

651
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,219
‐ Yeah, the vessels are gorgeous.

652
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,220
She has impeccable taste.

653
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:50,219
‐ Oh, no, honey, you have the eye.

654
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,599
‐ Aw.
‐ Mm.

655
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,939
‐ That sounds great.

656
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,349
Yeah, Gwynnie seems to think so.

657
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,149
Paltrow. Goop picked us up,

658
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,110
and sales have been
through the roof ever since.

659
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,119
Hey.

660
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,489
‐ Hey.

661
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,449
‐ Are you sure you're okay?
‐ Yeah.

662
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,039
No, this is so fun.

663
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,409
‐ Whoa.

664
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,789
‐ Sloane, do you need a helper?

665
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,419
‐ Please. I've always
skated circles around you.

666
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,759
That was in your youth.

667
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,589
I mean, I've lapped you
like 12 times today.

668
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,429
‐ Like I'm even trying.
‐ Like it would even matter.

669
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,679
‐ 20 bucks says I can do
two laps in under a minute.

670
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,259
‐ 50 bucks says I can do three.

671
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,849
‐ Let's do it. Jane, time us.

672
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,269
‐ Oh, I'm actually having fun just‐‐

673
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:36,059
‐ Jane.
‐ Okay, fun. Yeah.

674
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,849
No problem.

675
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
Ready?

676
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,399
Set.

677
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,700
Go.

678
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,659
‐ Move!
‐ No!

679
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,500
‐ I love it when they do this.

680
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,039
‐ What are they doing?
‐ They're racing.

681
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,329
‐ Ah, yeah.

682
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:01,129
‐ Jane, time!
‐ Oh, I forgot to press start.

683
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,129
How long do you guys think‐‐
‐ Don't‐don't tell them that.

684
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,759
‐ You need to take a break yet, Sloane?

685
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,879
‐ Huh, maybe you should just

686
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,510
worry about yourself.
‐ Oh, yeah?

687
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,009
‐ Oh!
‐ Ooh.

688
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,729
‐ Mm.
‐ Ow.

689
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,059
Should we stop them?

690
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,269
No, they'll
tire themselves out eventually.

691
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,309
Yeah. That's right.

692
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,479
‐ That's the way it goes.
‐ Whoo!

693
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,899
Get off me!

694
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,319
‐ I love you guys. I love you.

695
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,779
No! You're such a cheater!

696
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,699
‐ Stop it!
‐ You stop it!

697
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,029
‐ ...a little restless.
‐ They're gonna need to turn around.

698
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,619
‐ Look, some of us were here
when you said to be here.

699
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,529
‐ Jane, is that‐‐ That's what
you're wearing, right? ‐ Yeah.

700
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,409
All right. Harper!

701
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,789
Eric, can you make them be still?

702
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,619
‐ Wow.

703
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,379
‐ It's my early Christmas present.

704
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,539
Harper, please come here.

705
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,799
‐ Honey, we're very late.

706
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,759
‐ Ted, the family holiday photo

707
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,179
is an essential element
of every candidate's feed,

708
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,009
and if we cannot manage to post one,

709
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,719
we do not deserve to have
that account at all.

710
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,059
‐ All right. Up, up, up, kids.
‐ That is so true.

711
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,269
‐ Jane, get out of the middle.
‐ Come on, Matilda.

712
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,639
‐ Oh.
‐ You have to stand, honey.

713
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,599
Abby, would you mind taking that?

714
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,269
‐ Yeah, not at all.
‐ Oh, thank you.

715
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,069
‐ Okay, here we go. Here we go.
‐ Around and face this way.

716
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,479
Thank you.
‐ Okay.

717
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,819
‐ Everyone say, "Christmas."

718
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,239
‐ No, don't say that.

719
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,569
Just smile.

720
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,279
Okay.

721
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,329
Ah, good. I can't wait.

722
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:19,249
Blurry. Boring.

723
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,959
Nope. Nope. Nope.

724
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,879
Okay, none of these will do.

725
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,749
Uh, we will try again tomorrow.

726
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,839
- Thank you.
- Where's Abby?

727
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,609
Ted, Tipper.

728
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,699
Oh, I'm so glad you made it.

729
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,909
Oh, mwah. Oh.
‐ Carolyn, you are a vision.

730
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,699
- Gorgeous dress.
- Mwah.

731
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,289
Uh, you remember my daughters
Harper, Jane and Sloane.

732
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,539
Sloane's husband Eric.

733
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,539
Their children Matilda and Magnus.

734
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,869
And this is Harper's friend Abby.

735
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,169
Charmed. This is my assistant Levi.

736
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,799
Though, truth be told, in a few years,
we'll probably all be working for him.

737
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,339
Oh, you're too kind.

738
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,839
‐ Oh.
‐ Is the white whale here?

739
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,259
‐ Ah, indeed. Let me take you over.

740
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,389
‐ Oh, Harper, come with us.

741
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,809
Uh, Jane, uh, uh, keep Abby company.

742
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,519
‐ You got it.
‐ Dad, should I come, too?

743
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,269
I'll come right back. ‐
Okay. ‐ N‐No, honey.

744
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,349
Just, uh, enjoy yourself.
‐ Great.

745
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,729
Now, Harry's tough.

746
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,979
Don't let her throw you.

747
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,819
‐ I'm gonna take the twins
to the kids' club.

748
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,149
Please order me several drinks.

749
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,189
‐ Yeah.

750
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,489
‐ Come on, you guys.

751
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,069
Let's go play.

752
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,199
Okay. Well...

753
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,449
looks like it's just us ladies.

754
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,869
Now, I don't know about you,
but I am single

755
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:41,460
and ready to mingle, so...

756
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,129
Harry.

757
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,789
This is‐‐ ‐ Ted Caldwell.

758
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,049
Ms. Levin, it is an honor.

759
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,839
‐ I am gonna leave you two
to get acquainted.

760
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,969
‐ Okay. Thank you.

761
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,629
This is my husband Scott.

762
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,679
- We met on Bumble.
- Pleasure.

763
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,309
And, uh, this is my wife Tipper.

764
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,019
My daughter Harper, who writes for the‐‐

765
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,429
‐ Pittsburgh Post‐Gazette.

766
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,809
‐ Yes.
‐ Yes, I'm familiar.

767
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,309
‐ You've read her work?

768
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,270
‐ Yes.

769
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,949
‐ Hey, could I get a vodka neat?

770
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,660
Thanks.

771
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,040
‐ You're new.

772
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:24,869
‐ Yeah, I'm just visiting.
‐ From where?

773
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:27,039
‐ I'm really not interested
in meeting anyone tonight, so‐‐

774
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,340
‐ I am.

775
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,379
Oh, I'll have to check out Goop.

776
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,379
Was that‐‐ When was that one, again?

777
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,069
‐ Are you enjoying the party?

778
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:52,229
‐ Yeah.

779
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,859
That's great.

780
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,739
If my friend ditched me at a party
where I didn't know anyone,

781
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,529
I probably wouldn't have a good time.

782
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,699
‐ Oh, no, sh‐she didn't ditch me.

783
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,989
No, she's just helping your dad.

784
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,290
‐ Yeah, she's very helpful.

785
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,499
So, how long have you
and Harper been roommates?

786
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,749
‐ I moved in like six months ago.

787
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,339
‐ You moved in to her place?

788
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,459
‐ Mm‐hmm.

789
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,299
‐ Isn't it a one‐bedroom?

790
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,009
‐ Technically, yes.

791
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,469
Yeah, well, it was a one‐bedroom,

792
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:20,299
and‐and now that we have
converted the pantry

793
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,009
I‐into my bedroom, it's a two‐bedroom.

794
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:25,229
Um, it's really spacious
in there, and it's‐‐

795
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,099
‐ I don't want to have
this conversation anymore.

796
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,730
‐ No problem.

797
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,149
‐ Being mayor is no small task.

798
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:35,779
However, it's a task I am not only up for
but eager to take on.

799
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,399
I'm gonna stop you right there.

800
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,319
I have a perfect record.

801
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,739
And do you know why?

802
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,529
Because I do my homework.

803
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,539
Last election, I almost backed Dave Grady.

804
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,789
‐ Dave Grady? Didn't his son‐‐

805
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,669
‐ Get arrested
for exotic animal smuggling?

806
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,789
Yes.

807
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:54,129
I'm telling you this
because I'm not just looking at you.

808
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,459
This is a family affair.

809
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,549
‐ Well, I can assure you,

810
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:01,220
this family has nothing to hide.

811
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,609
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey. Hey.

812
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,439
‐ Hi. Can I have a sip of your drink?

813
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,440
‐ Yeah, of course.
‐ Thank you.

814
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,029
Mm.
‐ You okay?

815
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,239
‐ Mm‐hmm.

816
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,239
I just needed a bit of a breather.

817
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,579
Thank you.

818
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,829
Harper?

819
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,119
Mm!

820
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,579
Hi!

821
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,959
Hi.

822
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,669
You look incredible.

823
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,749
‐ As always.
‐ Oh, my God.

824
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,799
You, too. God, guys.

825
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,799
Oh, um, this is my roommate Abby.

826
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,759
And this is Kelly and Ashley.

827
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,339
‐ Oh, lovely to meet you.
‐ Yes.

828
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,299
- Nice to meet you, too.
- Hey, you guys.

829
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,889
Wow.

830
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,139
God, sorry, just seeing the three of you
standing next to each other

831
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,679
takes me right back to high school.

832
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,979
Minus the bad cafeteria food.

833
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,689
You're so funny.

834
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,529
‐ Uh, Harper, can I talk
to you for a second?

835
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,529
Um, yeah.

836
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,779
I'll just be a sec.

837
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,159
‐ Am I crazy, or did you have
absolutely no idea

838
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,659
I was coming to dinner last night?

839
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,579
‐ It was a surprise.
‐ Yeah.

840
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,209
Yeah, I thought so.

841
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:13,959
Um, sorry about that.
‐ It's not you.

842
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,339
‐ But, actually,
I'd love to do... that again.

843
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,129
Like, hang out again, if you got time.

844
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:22,549
‐ That sounds so nice, and, um...

845
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:26,049
and I just don't know, uh,
'cause it's so busy and‐‐

846
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,099
‐ Yeah. Totally got it.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

847
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,139
‐ No pressure.
‐ Yeah.

848
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,479
‐ But that being said, if you, you know,

849
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,979
and‐and your roommate want
to get out and hang out,

850
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,399
that'd be great.
‐ Abby. Yeah.

851
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,059
Abby. Yeah. Absolutely.

852
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,819
‐ Hey, if she doesn't
sleep with him, then I will.

853
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,279
I'm just kidding. I would never.

854
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,659
‐ He's definitely still into her.

855
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,279
‐ I know.

856
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:53,539
I should...

857
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,499
take this.

858
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,669
Hello?

859
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,089
Did you know that you're standing

860
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,919
in a country club
that didn't let women have

861
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,259
their own memberships
until the early 2000s?

862
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,929
‐ How do you know that?

863
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,889
‐ Um, I might be tracking you,

864
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,889
but it's for your own safety, clearly.

865
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:08,890
‐ What‐what do you want?

866
00:38:08,891 --> 00:38:11,639
I want you to break out of that closet.

867
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,099
‐ I am not in the closet.

868
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,689
I told you, Harper's gonna
tell her parents everything

869
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:15,690
right after the holidays.

870
00:38:15,691 --> 00:38:17,609
‐ You deserve to be with someone

871
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:21,109
who shouts their love for you
from the rooftops.

872
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,529
That's very sweet.

873
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,239
‐ So stop being a doormat, you fool.

874
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,489
‐ Did you need something,
or did you just call to shame me?

875
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,779
‐ I'm not shaming you.

876
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,079
I just think the choice
you're making is dumb

877
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,659
and you should feel bad
about it and yourself.

878
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,660
Also, I am loving these fish.

879
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:38,039
If I wanted to buy
the exact same one for myself,

880
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,799
where‐where do you think I would do that?

881
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,009
‐ What?

882
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:43,839
You know what, I think I should Google it.

883
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,130
I'm gonna Google it. Thanks.

884
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,639
‐ Hey.

885
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,770
‐ Oh, hey. Hey.

886
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,529
‐ How's it going?
‐ Great.

887
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:08,029
‐ I was just taking a break from
diagnosing everyone's mystery illnesses.

888
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,329
‐ Hey, I wasn't trying
to eavesdrop or anything.

889
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:14,449
I was out there before you came out.

890
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:17,120
You didn't see me, but, um...

891
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,879
I can relate.

892
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,880
‐ Like, to what?

893
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,299
‐ Nothing.

894
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:31,099
Nothing.

895
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,220
Okay. I'm gonna go back inside.

896
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,019
I'm sure my mother's hairdresser
wants to show me her weird finger again.

897
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,020
So...

898
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,900
I like your jacket.

899
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,200
Okay.

900
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,579
Thank you. Thank you so much.

901
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,909
Will you all please join me in welcoming

902
00:39:55,910 --> 00:40:00,539
my dear, dear friend,
Councilman Ted Caldwell.

903
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:06,129
Thank you so much. Thank you.

904
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,049
Isn't this the best time of year?

905
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,509
I mean, really.

906
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,469
I know we're all having
a great time tonight,

907
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:13,299
so I will be brief.

908
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,679
I've accomplished a lot in my life,

909
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,099
and serving you on the city council

910
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:22,859
is right up there
with my most rewarding life experiences.

911
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,149
But I'm ready for more.

912
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,319
These are turbulent times,

913
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,369
and the way I can ensure
depravity doesn't seep in

914
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,949
through the cracks of our community

915
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:40,039
is by making sure there are no cracks.

916
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,040
No cracks!

917
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:48,759
Look, our foundation is built
on family, tradition and faith,

918
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:54,219
and that is the only way
we will keep safe and strong.

919
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,309
I have loved being your city councilman,

920
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:58,469
and I can't wait to be your mayor.

921
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,769
Merry Christmas.

922
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,069
...the way I can ensure depravity

923
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:50,319
doesn't seep in through
the cracks of our community

924
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,489
is by making sure there are no cracks.

925
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,789
Look, our foundation is built

926
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:03,209
on family, tradition and faith,

927
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:08,290
and that is the only way
we will keep safe and strong.

928
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:17,759
Um, for the chicken breast,

929
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,019
we were looking at a quarter cup of honey,
and remember to use local honey...

930
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,129
Whoa.

931
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:50,250
Shit. Shit!

932
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,589
Come on. Come on.

933
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,670
Nope. Shut up, shut up. Oh, no.

934
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,559
Oh!

935
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,229
Abby, what are you doing in the closet?

936
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:07,519
‐ I‐‐ Well, I guess
I must have been sleepwalking.

937
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,519
‐ Oh, that is very dangerous.

938
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,519
I once took too many Ambien,

939
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,649
and I bought a racehorse online.

940
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,029
- Oh.
- Okay.

941
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,609
You need to go back downstairs, Abby.

942
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:18,109
‐ Okay.
‐ Carefully.

943
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,569
‐ Yeah, uh‐‐
‐ Are you all right to do that?

944
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,279
Yeah. Oh, gosh, my phone, too.

945
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,829
‐ God, I‐I was in such a daze.
‐ I'll get all this.

946
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:24,869
‐ Okay.
‐ Go on.

947
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:25,870
Um, I‐I was‐‐

948
00:43:25,871 --> 00:43:27,419
‐ Do you want me to come with you?

949
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,499
No, thank you.

950
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,630
I'm sorry about this.

951
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:35,129
Oh, my God.

952
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:37,429
How did you get down here?

953
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,389
‐ When I saw that mess upstairs,

954
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:41,889
I knew my mom would be busy
for the next two hours.

955
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:43,559
‐ What do you want to do for two hours?

956
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,520
‐ I don't know.
‐ Hmm.

957
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,120
Mm.

958
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,299
‐ Abby?
‐ Shit.

959
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,709
Fuck.

960
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,169
Abby, honey, are you okay?

961
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:19,129
‐ Uh‐huh. I'm‐I'm‐I'm okay.

962
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:21,049
I can't believe I fell asleep.

963
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:23,809
Um, I think there's
something against the door.

964
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:25,809
Um, I'm just moving it right now.

965
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:27,020
Sorry. It's heavy.

966
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,139
Morning.

967
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,099
‐ Why did you block the door?

968
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,610
‐ I‐I didn't want to sleepwalk again.

969
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,279
‐ Well, sorry to barge in.

970
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,399
The twins usually stay down here.

971
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,319
I'm just getting them Jane's old Game Boy.

972
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,449
‐ Morning, kids.

973
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,619
‐ Morning.
‐ Abby.

974
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,909
Uh, honey, I'm headed to the office,
but I wanted to let you know

975
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:50,540
I have invited Harry Levin and her husband
to our Christmas Eve party.

976
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,629
‐ What?

977
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:53,709
Well, you heard what she said.

978
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:56,629
It's not just about me.

979
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,459
It's about our whole family.

980
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,049
And what is a better
representation of our family

981
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:04,350
than your Christmas Eve party?

982
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:07,220
‐ It is legendary.

983
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,979
Mwah!

984
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,889
‐ Have a good day.
‐ You know I will.

985
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:13,149
Can't even believe that.

986
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:15,309
That is two more people on the guest list.

987
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:18,069
I basically have to reimagine
the entire party.

988
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:19,739
Man.

989
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,359
‐ Found it.

990
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,949
Okay, come on, you two.

991
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:25,870
Let's look at it.

992
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,949
That was very, very close.

993
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,459
‐ We shouldn't have done that.

994
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:34,579
‐ Harper, we've been up since 5:45 a.m...
‐ This is the last batch.

995
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,919
‐ ...and the twins already made
their own batch of cookies

996
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,089
and decorated them.
‐ No.

997
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:40,919
We're making these for the party.

998
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,179
‐ Okay, I'm off.

999
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,589
‐ What? Where are you going?

1000
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:45,509
‐ Uh, Levi has a connection
with a local potpourri vendor.

1001
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:46,719
He's gonna introduce us.

1002
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,389
‐ Great. Right.
‐ Yeah.

1003
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:49,390
Bye, babe.

1004
00:45:49,391 --> 00:45:50,559
It just runs everywhere.

1005
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,639
‐ Bye, kids.
‐ That's right. That's right.

1006
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,809
Bye, Daddy.

1007
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:54,019
‐ Jane. Oh, my God.

1008
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,519
‐ I'm just gonna do a button. Can I‐‐
‐ No, no.

1009
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,019
‐ You can't decorate these.
‐ But they have buttons.

1010
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,729
‐ And can you not?
I'm trying to have an even number.

1011
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,359
‐ Mommy, when are we gonna see Santa?

1012
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,819
‐ Honey, I don't know
if we're gonna have time

1013
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,699
to see him this year.
Jane, can you not? I just‐‐

1014
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,529
‐ Oh, take them to see Santa Claus.

1015
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:07,829
This could be the last year
that they see him.

1016
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:09,119
‐ Why? Is Santa dying?

1017
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,829
‐ No.
‐ Are we dying?

1018
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:13,119
‐ No. Fine, I will take you.

1019
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,289
I still need to get
a white elephant gift anyway.

1020
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:17,629
Did you guys get yours?
‐ Yes.

1021
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:20,249
Yeah, I'm making
something very special.

1022
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:21,629
‐ Uh, what is white elephant?

1023
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:23,549
Oh, it's a gift exchange game we do

1024
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:25,969
every year at our Christmas Eve party.
‐ Oh.

1025
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:27,929
‐ And I guess you don't know what it is

1026
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:30,469
because Harper forgot
to tell you about it.

1027
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:32,389
‐ I'm sorry.
‐ That's okay.

1028
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:33,809
I‐I can run out and grab one today.

1029
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:37,649
‐ Great. So, you girls can tag along
with Sloane to the mall.

1030
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:40,189
‐ Oh. Actually, I told Dad
that I'd go to his office

1031
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:42,439
and help him write his speech
for Carolyn's dinner tonight.

1032
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,359
‐ Yeah, I wish I could go,

1033
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,159
but, um, I have to put
the finishing touches

1034
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,369
on my Christmas gifts.

1035
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:50,239
‐ Guess it's just gonna be
you and me. Fun.

1036
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,199
Well, just make sure
you're all back here by 4:00.

1037
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,579
‐ That's okay?

1038
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:56,579
‐ We are going to get
that Christmas photo tonight

1039
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,879
before we leave for dinner.

1040
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,039
‐ Yes.
‐ Yes.

1041
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,309
‐ Oh. Hey.

1042
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:14,019
Hey. Can you watch them for a bit?

1043
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:16,139
I have to run an errand.
Um, Santa promised them

1044
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,359
the complete works of Sylvia Plath, so...

1045
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,649
Is that all right?

1046
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:21,769
‐ Yeah.

1047
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:23,279
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1048
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,029
‐ Okay. Thank you.

1049
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:27,109
Be good, you two.

1050
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:34,159
‐ Hi, guys.
Do you, um, want to come over‐‐

1051
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,579
Want to‐‐ Come on.

1052
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,710
‐ Why was Aunt Harper hiding
in your room this morning?

1053
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,299
‐ Uh, we were playing a game.

1054
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,969
‐ Like hide‐and‐seek?

1055
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,599
‐ Yeah, like hide‐and‐seek.

1056
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,179
We love that game.

1057
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,179
‐ What do you guys think about
this white elephant game?

1058
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,019
What gift should I get? Can you help me?

1059
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:58,769
‐ How about this?

1060
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:00,399
‐ That is nice.

1061
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,729
I was thinking maybe
something everyone might like.

1062
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:05,609
Like, um...

1063
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:08,279
I don't know, a scarf
might be good, actually.

1064
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,699
Someone might want to have that.

1065
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,120
Seems Christmassy.

1066
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,579
Oh.

1067
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,409
Hey, come on. Um...

1068
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:20,369
Hey, Carolyn.

1069
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:21,880
Hey, it's good to see you.

1070
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:25,209
I'm Abby. We met last night.

1071
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:27,209
I'm Harper Caldwell's friend.

1072
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:29,719
Oh! Oh, yes.

1073
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,969
Yes, of course.

1074
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:33,260
Mm.

1075
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,310
It's lovely seeing you.

1076
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:40,350
‐ Hey, I'm‐I'm really looking forward
to dinner tonight.

1077
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,440
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay.

1078
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,319
Have‐have a nice day. I'll see you later.

1079
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,359
Hey! Ma'am!

1080
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,779
Oh, ma'am! CRYSTAL: Ma'am,
we're gonna stop you right there.

1081
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,819
‐ Ma'am, put the bag on the floor.
‐ Okay.

1082
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:54,989
- Miss, put it down.
- Ma'am!

1083
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:57,579
Put the bag on the floor
and slide it to me.

1084
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:58,909
‐ You want to explain that?
‐ A‐As I've said,

1085
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:01,369
I did not put that in my bag.
There might‐‐

1086
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:03,379
‐ Oh, you didn't put it in your bag...
‐ Oh.

1087
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,499
‐ ...but it ended up in your bag, so this
is probably just a big misunderstanding.

1088
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,009
‐ Maybe it grew legs
and then it walked into her bag.

1089
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:10,549
Did you check it for legs, or‐‐

1090
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:11,879
‐ I haven't checked it for legs.
‐ You haven't done that.

1091
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,799
‐ I'm not suggesting that it grew legs.

1092
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,759
‐ It's not looking good, sweetie.

1093
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,969
‐ Pittsburgh, huh?

1094
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:18,269
‐ Yeah.

1095
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:19,979
‐ What are you doing down this way?

1096
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,349
‐ You pulling a job?

1097
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:22,689
Jacking a roost?

1098
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:24,309
‐ What was that?
‐ Yeah, hocking crank

1099
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:25,649
and breaking bad?

1100
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:27,689
‐ I'm not doing any of those things.
‐ Smash and grab?

1101
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:29,739
‐ I‐I didn't take this necklace.
‐ Wow.

1102
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:31,699
I'm sure that you could
review some footage.

1103
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:32,700
Aren't there cameras in malls?

1104
00:49:32,701 --> 00:49:34,699
‐ Are you telling me how to do my job?
‐ There are cameras everywhere.

1105
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,909
‐ You're gonna regret it.
‐ No.

1106
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:37,029
‐ You know what? Fine.
‐ No, I'm not doing any‐‐

1107
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:38,989
‐ Why don't you go ahead and do
my job, hotshot? ‐ Good freaking luck.

1108
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,409
- You're in charge now.
- Yeah.

1109
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:41,909
‐ Can you believe‐‐
‐ No, I'm gonna get her to sing, okay?

1110
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:43,669
- Go ahead.
- I'm gonna make this little birdie

1111
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:45,920
go tweet, tweet, tweet, becau‐‐
‐ Go ahead.

1112
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,049
Eugene.

1113
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:50,459
‐ Goddamn it. We're‐‐
‐ What are you‐‐

1114
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,879
‐ I heard there were Cruffins in here.

1115
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,969
‐ No.

1116
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:54,429
‐ There aren't any Cruffins.

1117
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:56,429
There's not, or there were? Were there?

1118
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:58,429
No, we stopped
keeping food in here. - No.

1119
00:49:58,430 --> 00:49:59,769
Dad, Abby would never do this.

1120
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:00,979
Go get ready quick, quick, quick,

1121
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:02,139
because we're late now.

1122
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,309
This isn't a conversation, Harper.

1123
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:04,310
Please, Dad, just be‐‐

1124
00:50:04,311 --> 00:50:05,809
Shh! Quiet.

1125
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:07,439
- Okay. I'm sorry.
- Oh, I know. I know.

1126
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,190
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1127
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:16,569
‐ I didn't do it.

1128
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:17,909
‐ Baby, I know.

1129
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:21,699
But Carolyn thinks it would just be better
if you weren't at the dinner.

1130
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,789
Look, it's gonna be so boring anyways.

1131
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:25,419
You're lucky you don't have to go.

1132
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,420
Come here.

1133
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:35,129
Can we hang out tonight after the dinner?

1134
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:37,599
My friends want to go out,
and‐and we can go with them

1135
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,009
or we can not go with them, but...

1136
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:42,639
I just think we‐we need a break

1137
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,729
from the family.

1138
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:46,150
Yeah, s‐‐

1139
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:49,859
‐ Harper, we have got to go.

1140
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,359
Come on, we're gonna be late.

1141
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,069
Okay.

1142
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:54,489
‐ I'll see you later?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

1143
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:55,609
‐ Okay.

1144
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:56,949
I'm sorry.

1145
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:59,369
We weren't able to get the photo again.

1146
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:37,819
‐ Hey.

1147
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,869
‐ We meet again.

1148
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:41,449
Yeah.

1149
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:43,079
‐ No Harper?

1150
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,909
‐ No, she's, um, with her family.

1151
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:47,869
I‐I'm gonna meet up with her in a bit.

1152
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:49,329
What'd you get?

1153
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:51,999
‐ Um...

1154
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,049
Oh, I can't tell you, because it's for
the white elephant party.

1155
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:58,009
‐ Ah, you're going to that, too?

1156
00:51:58,010 --> 00:51:59,389
‐ Oh, yeah.

1157
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:01,219
Yeah, my family goes every year.

1158
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,139
It's, um...

1159
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:05,219
God, it's the best party of the year.

1160
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,059
You know, I'm‐I'm glad I ran into you,

1161
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:13,229
'cause I'm having this thing where
if I stick my finger in my eye,

1162
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,979
it, like, really hurts.

1163
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:18,609
‐ Yeah, I mean, that's
a classic case of, um,

1164
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:20,869
contact stupiditis.

1165
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:23,119
Um, because it's a stupid thing to do.

1166
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,909
‐ Yep.
‐ Once you get to

1167
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:26,789
the finger‐poking stage,
you're‐you're pretty much dead.

1168
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:31,539
I'd really like to drink some alcohol.

1169
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:33,250
Do you know where I could do that?

1170
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,590
‐ Yes.

1171
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:58,609
‐ Yes, you are.
‐ I wish.

1172
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,449
‐ Just tell me.
‐ I wish I had a story, like‐‐

1173
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:02,069
‐ Did you steal it?
‐ No.

1174
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:05,739
And I still don't have
a white elephant gift, on top of it all.

1175
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:07,829
‐ You've got to get one.
‐ I'm trying.

1176
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:09,409
‐ I will help you with this.

1177
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:11,789
I know a lot of places that aren't malls.

1178
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:13,079
‐ That would be great.

1179
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:26,929
‐ What did you mean last night
when you said you could relate?

1180
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:30,139
‐ That was just a comment
based on an assumption

1181
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:33,060
that I was making about you and Harper.

1182
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:38,730
‐ I think it's probably
an accurate assumption.

1183
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:43,159
You don't have to talk to me
about this stuff.

1184
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,529
I know it's weird, like‐‐

1185
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:46,409
‐ So, what has she told you?

1186
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:48,619
‐ That you dated in high school.

1187
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,869
That you were her first girlfriend.

1188
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:52,790
That's about it.

1189
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:55,920
‐ Is there more?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

1190
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,960
Yeah, a little.

1191
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,930
I mean...

1192
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,639
Yeah.

1193
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:10,139
Yeah, growing up,
we were totally inseparable.

1194
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:11,849
We were best friends.

1195
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:15,020
And then, freshman year,
we became more than friends.

1196
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:18,270
We started dating.

1197
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:23,449
But nobody knew that, obviously.

1198
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:26,489
And we would, like,
leave these little love letters

1199
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:28,279
in‐in each other's lockers.

1200
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:31,409
And one day, one of Harper's friends
found one of the letters,

1201
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:34,709
and she asked Harper wh‐what it was about,

1202
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:39,499
and Harper basically just said
that I am gay

1203
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,339
and that I wouldn't leave her alone.

1204
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:44,299
And then within a couple days,
like, everybody in school found out,

1205
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:47,340
and everybody was so awful to me.

1206
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,430
‐ I'm sorry, that's‐‐ I'm sorry.

1207
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:54,559
‐ Yeah, so the thing that
I can relate to is just

1208
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:58,269
being in love with somebody that is...

1209
00:54:58,270 --> 00:55:01,070
too afraid to show the world who they are.

1210
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:09,700
But that was a long time ago.

1211
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,289
‐ Yeah.

1212
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:16,289
‐ Thank you!

1213
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:19,040
All right, that's enough.

1214
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:23,879
And with this next song,
we're gonna need a little help from you.

1215
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,469
‐ We're gonna ask you a...

1216
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:28,089
‐ Question.
‐ ...question.

1217
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:30,349
And you are going to...

1218
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:31,929
‐ Give us the answer.
‐ ...answer.

1219
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:34,059
‐ Yeah.
‐ It's simple.

1220
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,639
Here we go.

1221
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:42,609
We're gonna
sing. Ready? ‐ Mm‐hmm. Yeah.

1222
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,999
‐ Everybody!
‐ Whoa.

1223
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:05,919
‐ No. No, what? Oh, my God, no.
‐ What?

1224
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,879
‐ Oh, we're gonna get
a little more intimate now.

1225
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,219
Yes!

1226
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,389
Oh...

1227
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:16,019
Come on, you want to hear her sing, right?

1228
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:19,689
Yeah. Yeah, we
want to hear her sing. ‐

1229
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:56,809
‐ Um, I should‐‐ I should close out.

1230
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:58,849
It's‐‐ Harper texted me.

1231
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:01,189
‐ Oh.
‐ Yes.

1232
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:07,569
...of the square.

1233
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:09,189
The guy at the top of the square.

1234
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:10,399
That's the business model.

1235
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,029
It's brilliant.

1236
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:14,069
‐ Hi.

1237
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:15,579
‐ Oh, Abby's here.
‐ Shots, shots, shots.

1238
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,619
You guys ready?
‐ How was‐‐ How was tonight?

1239
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,159
‐ Shots! ‐ Oh, shots. ABBY:
It was great. It was good.

1240
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,959
- All right, I think I'm gonna grab a beer.
- Shots, shots, shots, shots.

1241
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,499
‐ No, no, no, no.
‐ No, Abby, Abby, hey.

1242
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,629
Cannot be at this place sober.

1243
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:24,839
It's a‐‐ Ready? Cheers.
ASHLEY and KELLY: Cheers.

1244
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,169
‐ Eyes, eyes.
‐ Eyes, eyes.

1245
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:28,419
‐ Eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes,
eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes.

1246
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:29,550
One, two, three. Go.

1247
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:32,549
Oh!

1248
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:34,259
‐ Okay, I need some music.
‐ Did you have dinner?

1249
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:35,679
- Come, come, come, come, come.
- Yeah.

1250
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,510
‐ Wait. Okay, I'll come right back.

1251
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:43,399
Are you having the most terrible time?

1252
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,479
‐ No.

1253
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,319
No, I'm‐I'm just tired.

1254
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,569
‐ Okay.
‐ I'm really tired.

1255
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:49,479
I think I'm gonna go.

1256
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,029
‐ Oh, no.

1257
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:52,529
Uh...

1258
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:54,779
I kind of want to stay
a little bit longer.

1259
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:56,700
Is that okay?

1260
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:04,119
‐ Yeah, you should‐‐ Yes, of course.

1261
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,379
Yeah. Yeah, I'm just‐‐
‐ Yeah?

1262
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:06,709
Are you sure?
‐ Mm.

1263
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:08,419
‐ Okay.

1264
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,009
And you'll get home okay?

1265
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:11,589
I won't be out late.

1266
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:12,969
Okay.

1267
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:15,719
Text me when you get home.

1268
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,099
Hey.

1269
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,259
How about you?

1270
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:19,769
You won't. You won't.

1271
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:22,310
- She will. You won't. You won't.
- You won't.

1272
00:58:56,890 --> 00:58:58,349
Well, that was fun.

1273
00:58:58,350 --> 00:59:00,099
Whew. Yeah.

1274
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,599
‐ I'm glad you came out.
‐ Yeah.

1275
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,849
‐ It's been a minute, you know,
since we've gotten to do this.

1276
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:09,560
Like, since we‐‐

1277
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:11,899
Well, you know.

1278
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,989
I've missed you.

1279
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:15,739
‐ No, it's nice to catch up.

1280
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:17,199
‐ Yeah.

1281
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:22,119
‐ Well, I'm that way.

1282
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,659
‐ Oh, darn.
‐ Where are you?

1283
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,159
I'm that way.

1284
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,669
‐ Good night.
‐ Good night.

1285
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,249
It was great seeing you.

1286
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,260
Hey, Harper, was there someone else?

1287
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:38,050
‐ What do you mean?

1288
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:41,140
‐ Is that why we broke up?

1289
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:44,269
‐ No.

1290
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:46,979
No, I mean, I‐I told you
that the long distance

1291
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:48,809
just got too hard and‐‐

1292
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:50,309
‐ The distance. Yeah, I know, I know.

1293
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:51,610
I know.

1294
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,109
I don't know. Just...

1295
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:58,990
kind of always felt like
there was something...

1296
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:04,040
Kind of felt like there was
something you weren't telling me.

1297
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:13,170
‐ There wasn't someone else.

1298
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:35,280
Hey.

1299
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,319
‐ What's wrong?

1300
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,659
‐ Just making sure you're okay.

1301
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:42,279
‐ Why wouldn't I be?

1302
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:44,869
‐ I don't know, you weren't
answering me, so I was‐‐

1303
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:47,909
‐ I‐I know, but you‐you knew
I was out with my friends.

1304
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:49,289
‐ Yeah, but, I mean, I didn't know that

1305
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:50,999
you were gonna be out
till 2:00 in the morning,

1306
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,209
so I'm just checking on you.

1307
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:54,499
‐ Okay.

1308
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,799
I'm sorry.
I didn't know I had a curfew.

1309
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,589
‐ What is going on with you?

1310
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:00,589
‐ Nothing. I‐‐

1311
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:02,299
Nothing.

1312
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:06,139
I just don't know why
you're keeping tabs on me.

1313
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:08,099
‐ Keeping tabs on you?
‐ Yeah.

1314
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,729
It just‐‐

1315
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:12,899
‐ What?

1316
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:16,479
‐ It just feels a little... suffocating.

1317
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,859
‐ I'm suffocating you?

1318
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:19,859
‐ Or not, but just‐‐

1319
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:21,819
‐ Well, I feel really suffocated
in the closet

1320
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:23,239
that you shoved me back into.
‐ Shh!

1321
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:24,699
You agreed to this.

1322
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:25,949
‐ Yeah, we were practically already here.

1323
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:27,199
‐ Can you sh‐‐

1324
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,619
Please be quiet.

1325
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:30,620
‐ I was gonna‐‐ I‐‐

1326
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,669
If I knew that part
of what I was agreeing to

1327
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:36,709
was you hanging out
with your ex‐boyfriend all night,

1328
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:39,710
‐ maybe I wouldn't have.
‐ God, Abby.

1329
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:45,349
I just‐‐ I feel like
we just need some space.

1330
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:46,640
‐ You need some space?

1331
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:50,270
Okay.

1332
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,849
‐ Abby.

1333
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:54,309
Oh.

1334
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:57,479
She is very heavy‐footed.

1335
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:02,489
Honey, I have a list of party errands
that Jane has volunteered to run,

1336
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:04,699
but I don't trust her
to do them on her own,

1337
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:07,159
so I need you to supervise.

1338
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,080
‐ Okay.

1339
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:15,580
‐ It's a long list.

1340
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:20,509
Okay.

1341
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:33,770
No, no.

1342
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:41,109
- Hey.
- Okay, so...

1343
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:44,489
I might have been a little judgmental
when we last spoke.

1344
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:48,159
You are in an unusual situation,
and as your friend,

1345
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,489
I should have created
a safe space for you to share

1346
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:52,909
without the threat of criticism, so...

1347
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:54,579
I'm sorry.

1348
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:56,249
I am here.

1349
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:57,879
No judgment.

1350
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,419
What is going on?

1351
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:00,999
Well, let's see.

1352
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,129
I was arrested by mall security yesterday,

1353
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:05,299
and now Harper's entire family
thinks I'm a criminal.

1354
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:07,759
And after spending her entire night, like,

1355
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,679
until 2:00 in the morning,
with her ex‐boyfriend Connor,

1356
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,019
she's acting like someone
I barely even recognize.

1357
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:16,599
And I want to just get out of here,
but it would cost me

1358
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,769
like a thousand dollars
to get a ride, and‐‐

1359
01:03:18,770 --> 01:03:21,359
This is why I avoid Christmas.

1360
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,029
It brings out the worst in everything.

1361
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:26,069
I‐I know this isn't about me.
I just feel crazy, like‐‐

1362
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:28,739
Do I‐‐ It's‐‐
Do I stick it out for two days?

1363
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:30,739
It's‐it's not that long.

1364
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,830
But I don't know. I‐‐

1365
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:35,909
What would you do?

1366
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:37,079
Uh...

1367
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,539
Uh... uh...

1368
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:39,669
I...

1369
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:41,799
Thank you.

1370
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,759
I'm gonna‐‐ I'm gonna need
to give this a think.

1371
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,510
I think.

1372
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,590
‐ Hello?

1373
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:16,159
Hey, um...

1374
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,909
Hey, it's Abby.

1375
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:20,039
Are you‐‐ Are you doing
anything right now?

1376
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,289
Who's really gonna want
a mini doughnut factory?

1377
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:23,839
Uh, this family.

1378
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,879
I saw two of their cousins
get in a fistfight

1379
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:27,719
over a quesadilla maker
at this party once.

1380
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,800
Oh, yikes.

1381
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:38,389
‐ Everything all right?

1382
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:39,690
‐ Yeah.

1383
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:45,859
Thank you so much. It looks so good.

1384
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:47,939
I mean, it‐it looks good.

1385
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:54,369
This is all for me.

1386
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:55,869
It's not. It's not.

1387
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:57,039
I'm just kidding.

1388
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,749
It's for my‐‐

1389
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:00,830
And yes, we'll have‐‐

1390
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:08,209
Ready to go?

1391
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:14,470
‐ It's probably okay.

1392
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,909
‐ Oh, do not put that there.

1393
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:34,659
What do you think this is, a barn party?

1394
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:37,579
Hey, everyone, please come down!

1395
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:41,249
We are getting this photo
as soon as Jane gets here.

1396
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:42,959
‐ Honey, are you sure
this is the best time?

1397
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,419
People will start arriving any minute.

1398
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:45,999
‐ It's the only time.

1399
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,509
Hi, Abby.
‐ Hi.

1400
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:53,009
Oh, where should I put
this white elephant gift?

1401
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:54,839
‐ I don't know. In the oven?

1402
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,469
Jesus, Abby, where do you think it goes?

1403
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:58,009
Under the damn tree.

1404
01:05:58,010 --> 01:05:59,639
I'm sorry.

1405
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,309
I'm sorry.

1406
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:03,649
You probably never even
had a Christmas tree.

1407
01:06:03,650 --> 01:06:06,109
We do this party every year,

1408
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:09,279
and every year,
no matter how early I start planning,

1409
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,989
I just feel totally unprepared.

1410
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:15,779
And I can't find my Christmas brooch.

1411
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:17,329
Have you seen it?

1412
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:18,909
You can tell me.

1413
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:20,329
I won't be mad.

1414
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:22,210
I just want to know it's safe.

1415
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:25,130
‐ I haven't seen it.

1416
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:28,039
‐ Okay.

1417
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:32,509
Well, if it should magically
appear on my dresser,

1418
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:34,509
there will be no questions asked.

1419
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:35,760
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay.

1420
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:46,309
Um...

1421
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:47,520
Hey, Ted.

1422
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:51,739
I just wanted to mention‐‐

1423
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:54,989
everything that happened yesterday
was a complete misunderstanding.

1424
01:06:54,990 --> 01:06:56,489
You know, I would never, ever‐‐

1425
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:58,739
You‐you don't‐‐ You don't have to explain.

1426
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:01,159
Let's just avoid
any further incidents, yes?

1427
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,909
‐ Yeah. Yes.
‐ Okay.

1428
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:05,459
‐ Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas Eve.
‐ Oh.

1429
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:07,459
‐ Hey, Abby.
‐ Hey.

1430
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:09,459
‐ Look at what this little elf brought in.

1431
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:11,299
Wow. What is that?

1432
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:13,049
‐ This is my masterpiece.

1433
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:15,549
Whoever picks it is gonna be very pleased.

1434
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:16,969
‐ Oh, Jane, I'm so glad you're here.

1435
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:18,299
The printer's jammed again.

1436
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,310
‐ Oh, okay. I'm on it.

1437
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,939
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

1438
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:36,739
What'd you do today?

1439
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:40,069
‐ I just went and got
a white elephant gift.

1440
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:41,409
‐ Oh.

1441
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:42,869
In town?

1442
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:44,199
‐ Yeah.

1443
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,619
‐ How'd you get there?

1444
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:46,709
‐ Has Jane arrived yet?

1445
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:49,539
‐ Yeah, Jane's in Ted's office with him.

1446
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:51,419
Jane, Ted, now!

1447
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:54,049
Nice of you two to join us.
Where are the twins?

1448
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:56,759
‐ They don't feel like having
their picture taken tonight.

1449
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:01,810
Harper, come with me.

1450
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:09,439
It's really a break from

1451
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,569
traditional gifting
and a move into the extraordinary.

1452
01:08:12,570 --> 01:08:15,239
The vessels are curated
for each individual.

1453
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:17,859
‐ We'd be happy to mindfully assemble‐‐
‐ Uh, S‐Sloane was

1454
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:21,569
on track to make partner at her firm
before she left to start a family.

1455
01:08:21,570 --> 01:08:22,739
She's our super mom,

1456
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:27,159
Harper is our powerhouse, and, uh, Jane...

1457
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,869
I‐is the only reason
the Internet ever works in this house.

1458
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:31,329
Aw.

1459
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:33,170
I have a way with routers.

1460
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:36,799
Excuse me, all.

1461
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,969
Uh, the twins have prepared
a little song for you.

1462
01:08:38,970 --> 01:08:40,259
Oh.

1463
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,609
‐ What are you drinking?

1464
01:08:55,610 --> 01:08:57,819
‐ Oh, it's a spiced... alcohol.

1465
01:08:57,820 --> 01:09:00,239
‐ Gross. Can I have some?
‐ Yeah.

1466
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:05,869
‐Mm‐hmm. ‐ So, Plort is the
leader of the Shadow Dreamers.

1467
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:07,909
He's half human, half Quazzle.
‐ Mm‐hmm. Mm‐hmm.

1468
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:10,329
‐ He's got the eyes of a Verg
but the heart of a Zengle.

1469
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:12,249
The Verg comes from his mother's side,
generations back.

1470
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:14,039
If you want the spa package vessel,

1471
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,879
you could do edible bubble bath.
‐ Excuse me, Sloane.

1472
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:18,009
Uh, Harry wants to meet the twins.

1473
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:19,379
‐ I'll find them.
‐ Okay.

1474
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:20,719
‐ Excuse me.

1475
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:23,599
‐ You know?
Thing is, my parents were so attached

1476
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:28,059
to me believing in Santa Claus
that even after years go by

1477
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:30,099
and I stop believing in Santa Claus,

1478
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:32,269
and they knew that I stopped
believing in Santa Claus,

1479
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:34,269
we just kept that charade going.

1480
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:37,479
Their investment in it just made me feel
so bad for them, you know?

1481
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,030
‐ Mm‐hmm.

1482
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:42,409
Yeah.

1483
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:44,449
‐ Like, so bad for them that...

1484
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:47,739
you know, that I eventually
just murdered them.

1485
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:48,909
‐ That sounds fun.
‐ Mm.

1486
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:50,370
Okay.

1487
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:53,039
What is happening?

1488
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,499
Hey, you guys.

1489
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,169
Connor, you made it.

1490
01:09:56,170 --> 01:09:57,879
- Hi. Merry Christmas. Hi.
- Hey, guys. Merry Christmas.

1491
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,709
Good to see you. Hi.

1492
01:09:59,710 --> 01:10:02,130
‐ Merry Christmas.
‐ I don't know.

1493
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:05,969
Yesterday, I'd never felt closer

1494
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:08,349
to another person
in my entire life, and now I...

1495
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:11,059
I don't know her.

1496
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:14,479
And I thought she loved me
and was happy, but I...

1497
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:18,519
I‐I see her here, and she's so terrified
of what everyone thinks,

1498
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,859
and it's just making me wonder
who the real Harper is.

1499
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:22,899
You know?

1500
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:24,950
‐ Well, maybe they both are.

1501
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:30,240
‐ I was gonna ask her
to marry me tomorrow.

1502
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:40,129
‐ Um, I'm gonna get you a real drink.

1503
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:41,970
Okay?

1504
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:46,639
Abby.

1505
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,429
Abby!

1506
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:50,470
Sorry. What?

1507
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:52,640
Um...

1508
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:55,099
How are you here?

1509
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:56,519
‐ When are you gonna get this?

1510
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,269
I have been tracking you.

1511
01:10:58,270 --> 01:10:59,649
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

1512
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:00,859
‐ Hello.

1513
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:01,860
‐ Hi.

1514
01:11:01,861 --> 01:11:02,899
I'm Tipper.

1515
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,489
- This is my home.
- Oh.

1516
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:06,240
‐ Are you the ex‐boyfriend?

1517
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:13,749
Y‐Yes. I am John,

1518
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:16,369
Abby's heterosexual ex‐boyfriend,

1519
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:19,459
and I have come to get her back.

1520
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:20,999
Mm. I see.

1521
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,839
Well, it would've been nice
to have known you were coming,

1522
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:28,339
but since you are here, enjoy.

1523
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:30,350
Thank you so much.

1524
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:34,139
Okay, I nailed that, and she is fabulous.

1525
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:35,389
‐ What are you doing?

1526
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:38,189
‐ That phone call earlier
was a cry for help.

1527
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:40,649
I'm here to rescue you.
Please get your things.

1528
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:46,489
‐ Is that the ex‐boyfriend?

1529
01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:49,410
Oh, my God.

1530
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:52,579
‐ I mean, I guess he's handsome. I‐‐

1531
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:54,580
Can we please go?

1532
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:01,209
‐ Harper.

1533
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:02,669
It's over.

1534
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:04,210
I'm done.

1535
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:12,310
‐ I'm just gonna...

1536
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:16,059
‐ Everybody, please take your seats.

1537
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:18,900
We're ready to begin white elephant.

1538
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:22,109
Abby. Hey.

1539
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:23,439
Can we just talk for a second?

1540
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,229
‐ No. I got to go. I‐I can't‐‐

1541
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:26,819
I can't do this for you anymore.

1542
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:28,569
But, uh, merry Christmas.

1543
01:12:28,570 --> 01:12:32,029
Enjoy your family, and enjoy Connor.

1544
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:35,159
‐ What? What?
No, I don't‐‐ I don't want him.

1545
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,749
I don't want Connor.

1546
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:37,909
I want you.

1547
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:39,079
‐ Then what was that?

1548
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:40,789
‐ I don't know.

1549
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:43,629
Why are you huddled
in a corner with Riley?

1550
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:45,959
‐ None of this has anything
to do with Riley.

1551
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,379
This is all happening
because of you, Harper.

1552
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:51,969
You not telling your parents about us
is a choice that you made.

1553
01:12:51,970 --> 01:12:53,929
‐ It is not that simple.
‐ Do you know how painful

1554
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:58,389
it's been to watch the person
that I love choose to hide me?

1555
01:12:58,390 --> 01:13:00,900
‐ I am not hiding you. I am hiding me.

1556
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:03,769
Okay?

1557
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:06,859
Our entire life,
we have been expected to be

1558
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:10,820
these perfect, golden children.

1559
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:15,539
I mean, love in our house wasn't
something we just got for free.

1560
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:17,119
It is something that we competed for,

1561
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,540
and if we veered
off their course, we lost it.

1562
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,289
I‐I know it's messed up, okay?

1563
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:24,959
I get it.

1564
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,629
But they're my parents,

1565
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:29,129
and I am scared that if
I tell them who I really am,

1566
01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:31,299
I will lose them.

1567
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:34,930
And I know, if I don't tell them,
I will lose you.

1568
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:38,980
I don't want to lose you.

1569
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:42,559
‐ Hey, come here. Come here.

1570
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,309
‐ No, I don't want to lose you.
‐ No, no.

1571
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:46,269
Look at me. Come here.
Look at me. It's okay.

1572
01:13:46,270 --> 01:13:48,360
‐ I don't‐‐ ‐ Hey, stop.

1573
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:52,410
- I don't want to lose you.
- You're not.

1574
01:13:57,410 --> 01:13:59,790
Matilda and Magnus...

1575
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:05,249
If you want a present...

1576
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:07,249
You better have a number.

1577
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:08,629
'Sup?

1578
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:10,009
‐ 'Sup?

1579
01:14:10,010 --> 01:14:11,549
Anybody else?

1580
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,840
‐ You pump?

1581
01:14:15,970 --> 01:14:18,509
‐ I'm sorry?
‐ Weights.

1582
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:20,390
‐ Oh.
‐ Yeah.

1583
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,479
‐ Yeah.

1584
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:25,900
You?
‐ Yeah. Yeah.

1585
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:29,030
What do you bench?

1586
01:14:30,110 --> 01:14:32,109
Thousand. Thou‐Thousand, plus.

1587
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:34,159
All right. Everybody have your numbers?

1588
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:35,779
‐ Kids?
‐ Sloane, Sloane, Sloane!

1589
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:37,369
‐ Hmm? Yeah?
‐ Can we just talk for a sec?

1590
01:14:37,370 --> 01:14:39,369
‐ Oh, what's there to talk about?
You and Abby are in

1591
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:41,199
a romantic relationship,
and you've been lying

1592
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,959
to the family about it
for God knows how long.

1593
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,539
Does that sound about right, or‐‐

1594
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:48,249
‐ Just, uh, please don't tell
Mom and Dad yet.

1595
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,549
Please, Sloane.

1596
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:52,880
I'm telling them after the holidays.

1597
01:15:01,470 --> 01:15:02,809
Just rip it.

1598
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:04,689
Please promise me you won't say anything.

1599
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:07,099
Now is just very bad timing,

1600
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:09,189
and I'm telling them everything
after the holidays anyways.

1601
01:15:09,190 --> 01:15:10,729
‐ Honestly, I feel sorry for you.

1602
01:15:10,730 --> 01:15:12,359
Mom and Dad are gonna be so heartbroken

1603
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,359
when they find out you've
been lying to them.

1604
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,569
‐ Sloane, if you‐‐
‐ Wait. Kids?

1605
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:18,909
Found you!

1606
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:20,119
Oh.

1607
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:21,329
‐ Are you kidding me?

1608
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:23,659
No one's supposed to know yet.

1609
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:25,409
We had an agreement.

1610
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:26,919
‐ I'm sorry.

1611
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:29,590
‐ I guess I'm not
the only one with a secret.

1612
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:34,549
‐ Wow.
‐ Yeah.

1613
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:36,429
‐ Yeah, that is‐‐ That's‐that's good mass.

1614
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:38,049
That is solid.
‐ Yeah. Thanks, man.

1615
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:40,299
Oh, my God. They all look so nice.

1616
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:42,139
Just choose, Jane.

1617
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:43,929
‐ Eeny, meeny, mi‐‐

1618
01:15:43,930 --> 01:15:45,479
I'm just kidding.

1619
01:15:46,481 --> 01:15:48,899
‐ You have no idea what goes on
in other people's families,

1620
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,979
so you need to just keep your mouth shut!

1621
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:53,439
You keep your mouth shut, psycho!

1622
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,360
‐ I should run. Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

1623
01:15:57,410 --> 01:15:59,159
Levi. We should‐‐

1624
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,240
Huh. I wonder what this one is.

1625
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:05,289
Abby, get the Santa.

1626
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:07,119
‐ I mean‐‐
‐ You stay out of this, Sappho.

1627
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,169
‐ I would‐‐

1628
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,169
‐ I don't know what this is.

1629
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:14,459
It's big.

1630
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:16,010
Oh!

1631
01:16:18,510 --> 01:16:20,259
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1632
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:21,799
‐ Oh, gosh.

1633
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,810
Here, help me out here.

1634
01:16:25,310 --> 01:16:27,519
What‐what‐what‐‐ Wh‐What is this?

1635
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,849
‐ It's a painting of Main Street.

1636
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:30,770
I made it.

1637
01:16:30,771 --> 01:16:32,359
‐ I love that.

1638
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:37,739
No! No, no, no!

1639
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:40,159
I'll kill you!

1640
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,199
I'll kill you!

1641
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,699
- What are you doing?
- Girls!

1642
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,949
What is going on?

1643
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:46,409
‐ Yeah, what is going on?

1644
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:48,459
Harper, do you want
to tell them, or should I?

1645
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:49,959
‐ Don't, Sloane!
‐ Why?

1646
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:51,129
It's not good timing?

1647
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:53,919
‐ Girls, stop that this instant!

1648
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,499
‐ Come on, guys. Just hug it out.

1649
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:56,669
Shut up, Jane!

1650
01:16:56,670 --> 01:16:58,379
‐ Don't do this, Sloane.

1651
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:00,839
‐ All this because you're scared
to not be the favorite.

1652
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:01,889
Pathetic.

1653
01:17:01,890 --> 01:17:03,049
‐ Sloane, you're making a scene!

1654
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:04,099
I am?

1655
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:06,470
You think she's so innocent?

1656
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,639
All of this is happening
because Harper is‐‐

1657
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,439
‐ Harper is a lesbian.

1658
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,450
Abby's her girlfriend.

1659
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:33,000
‐ She is lying.

1660
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,299
I am not a lesbian.

1661
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:40,090
Sloane is the one that has this big‐‐

1662
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:09,579
No!

1663
01:18:11,790 --> 01:18:13,749
Harper!

1664
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:15,879
‐ Stop it! Goddamn it, stop it!
‐ Oh, my.

1665
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:16,999
No!

1666
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,999
Enough!

1667
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:25,139
‐ I put 100 hours
into that painting, and you...

1668
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:28,390
you just destroyed it like it was nothing.

1669
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,980
It was something.

1670
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:35,860
I am something.

1671
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:38,609
And guess what.

1672
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:39,979
I like myself.

1673
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:44,450
And maybe you all don't
because I'm not fancy.

1674
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:48,869
But whether you like it or not,
I'm a part of this family,

1675
01:18:48,870 --> 01:18:51,409
and I will not be left out anymore!

1676
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:52,709
No!

1677
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:57,919
‐ Stop it, girls!

1678
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,919
Stop this right now.

1679
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,089
Guys, you keep ripping it more!

1680
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:03,549
Kids, what are you doing back there?

1681
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:06,220
Playing hide‐and‐seek
like Abby and Aunt Harper.

1682
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:24,199
Abby?

1683
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:31,620
‐ Want to go for a walk?

1684
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:33,910
Okay.

1685
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,749
Okay.

1686
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:38,829
Come on.

1687
01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:40,750
My parents loved Christmas.

1688
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,169
We would do all the stuff.

1689
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:45,469
We would decorate and...

1690
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:47,890
do the tree and watch, like,
every Christmas movie.

1691
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:56,229
After they died, I‐I couldn't really
bring myself to acknowledge Christmas.

1692
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:57,770
Hmm.

1693
01:19:59,650 --> 01:20:03,319
‐ The holidays were just
a huge reminder of...

1694
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:05,860
them not being here.

1695
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:10,319
So I really thought
maybe this year with...

1696
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:14,909
with Harper and meeting
her family, you know,

1697
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:16,790
that it would just feel different.

1698
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:27,589
I don't‐‐ I don't think that she...

1699
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:29,589
loves me as much as I thought she did.

1700
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:31,260
‐ Hey.

1701
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:37,349
Harper not coming out to her parents
has nothing to do with you.

1702
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:40,350
How could it not?

1703
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:46,110
‐ Remind me, what did your parents say
when you told them you were gay?

1704
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:51,200
‐ Um, that they loved and supported me.

1705
01:20:52,370 --> 01:20:54,580
‐ That's amazing.

1706
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,419
My dad...

1707
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:02,249
kicked me out of the house

1708
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:04,960
and didn't talk to me
for 13 years after I told him.

1709
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:09,300
Everybody's story is different.

1710
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,969
There's your version

1711
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:17,020
and my version and everything in between.

1712
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:22,939
But the one thing that
all of those stories have in common

1713
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:27,439
is that moment
right before you say those words,

1714
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:30,529
when your heart is racing

1715
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:32,820
and you don't know what's coming next.

1716
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:37,790
That moment's really terrifying.

1717
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:41,619
And then once you say those words,

1718
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:44,039
you can't unsay them.

1719
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:48,419
A chapter has ended,
and a new one's begun,

1720
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:52,589
and you have to be ready for that.

1721
01:21:52,590 --> 01:21:54,800
You can't do it for anyone else.

1722
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:59,639
Just because Harper isn't ready,

1723
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:02,189
it doesn't mean she never will be,

1724
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:04,099
and it doesn't mean she doesn't love you.

1725
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:13,449
I‐I want to be with someone who is ready.

1726
01:22:13,450 --> 01:22:15,370
‐ Mm.

1727
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:30,589
You look great in this coat.

1728
01:22:30,590 --> 01:22:32,509
- Merry Christmas. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1729
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:37,890
Just wait for me in the car.

1730
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,690
Great party.

1731
01:22:46,730 --> 01:22:48,319
‐ Yeah.

1732
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:49,440
‐ You okay?

1733
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:54,910
‐ I'm so sorry.

1734
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:04,290
Merry Christmas.

1735
01:23:05,870 --> 01:23:07,630
‐ Merry Christmas.

1736
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:14,379
‐ She's a really good one.

1737
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:16,220
Yeah.

1738
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:21,470
‐ Riley.
‐ Sloane.

1739
01:23:27,650 --> 01:23:29,520
‐ I'm sorry.

1740
01:23:30,730 --> 01:23:32,900
Okay, come on. Let's get you two to bed.

1741
01:23:34,990 --> 01:23:37,239
‐ Thank you, Ms. Levin, for coming,

1742
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:41,489
and again, my apologies for the spectacle.

1743
01:23:41,490 --> 01:23:43,250
‐ I'll call you.

1744
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,459
‐ What the hell happened tonight?

1745
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:54,969
Even as children,
you never behaved this badly.

1746
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:57,889
I expected more from you,
especially you, Harper.

1747
01:23:57,890 --> 01:23:59,929
You know how this world works.

1748
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:04,349
Reputation is everything,
and tonight you jeopardized mine.

1749
01:24:04,350 --> 01:24:07,189
Jane, I know you‐you just
wanted to be included.

1750
01:24:07,190 --> 01:24:08,479
‐ It was really nice.

1751
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:12,439
‐ Sloane, making up lies
about your sister.

1752
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:13,819
You're better than that.

1753
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:16,280
At least you used to be.

1754
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:20,989
‐ Sorry, I'm‐I'm just getting my stuff.

1755
01:24:20,990 --> 01:24:23,079
‐ Wait, Abby.

1756
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:24,700
Wait.

1757
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:29,170
Sloane wasn't lying.

1758
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:32,250
I'm gay.

1759
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:39,760
And I am in love with Abby.

1760
01:24:41,970 --> 01:24:43,969
I'm sorry I didn't tell you guys sooner,

1761
01:24:43,970 --> 01:24:47,519
but I know how much appearances
and reputation matter to you,

1762
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:50,809
and me being gay just didn't...

1763
01:24:50,810 --> 01:24:53,229
fit into the plan.

1764
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:57,149
But I...

1765
01:24:57,150 --> 01:25:00,360
let myself hurt Riley...

1766
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:05,159
...because I was so scared
that you would find out

1767
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,410
I wasn't who you wanted me to be.

1768
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,289
And...

1769
01:25:10,290 --> 01:25:12,880
I still regret it.

1770
01:25:14,170 --> 01:25:17,880
I can't do that to Abby...

1771
01:25:19,930 --> 01:25:21,720
...and throw away...

1772
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:24,680
...our life together.

1773
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:32,399
So I am done being scared,

1774
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,900
and I am done keeping secrets.

1775
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:38,820
I love you.

1776
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:05,470
‐ Eric and I are getting a divorce.

1777
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:09,680
We separated a few months ago.

1778
01:26:10,930 --> 01:26:12,979
And the truth is I didn't tell you

1779
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:15,230
because without my family
I'm worthless to you.

1780
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:22,149
We've spent our entire lives
trying to earn your love,

1781
01:26:22,150 --> 01:26:24,160
and I'm done, too.

1782
01:26:30,870 --> 01:26:34,370
‐ I don't have any secrets,
but I am an ally.

1783
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:51,599
‐ I'm gonna go.

1784
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:54,189
‐ Wait. No, no.

1785
01:26:57,980 --> 01:26:59,900
I did it.

1786
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:02,610
‐ Mm‐hmm.

1787
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,869
I'm sorry.

1788
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:09,490
Uh, it's just too late.

1789
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:56,749
I have always wanted to try karate,

1790
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:58,749
even though I know it's not elegant.

1791
01:27:58,750 --> 01:28:01,039
I hate flowers.

1792
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,709
‐ I see what you're doing.

1793
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:07,380
‐ We have been so worried
about seeming perfect.

1794
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:13,020
But maybe we don't even know
what perfect is.

1795
01:28:14,060 --> 01:28:16,389
We have one daughter

1796
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:20,399
who has been unhappy in a marriage
and felt like she couldn't tell us,

1797
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:23,689
and another daughter who...

1798
01:28:23,690 --> 01:28:27,359
just had her heart broken

1799
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:30,279
because she was afraid

1800
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:33,039
we wouldn't love her
if she told us the truth.

1801
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,039
And...

1802
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:38,669
The only reason that Jane is okay
is because we gave up on her

1803
01:28:38,670 --> 01:28:41,079
after she wouldn't stop
biting in preschool.

1804
01:28:43,130 --> 01:28:45,209
That is...

1805
01:28:45,210 --> 01:28:49,430
very far from perfect, if you ask me.

1806
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:59,019
‐ Thanks.

1807
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:01,189
‐ I'm really sorry.

1808
01:29:01,190 --> 01:29:02,689
‐ I know.

1809
01:29:02,690 --> 01:29:04,440
Me, too.

1810
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:08,199
And, Jane, I...

1811
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:11,659
I'm so sorry about your painting.

1812
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:13,449
It was really beautiful.

1813
01:29:13,450 --> 01:29:15,699
‐ It was.

1814
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:17,870
‐ Thanks, guys.

1815
01:29:23,710 --> 01:29:26,710
‐ He just needs a little time.

1816
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:33,969
Okay, listen to these ingredients:

1817
01:29:33,970 --> 01:29:35,309
maltodextrin,

1818
01:29:35,310 --> 01:29:38,019
autolyzed yeast extract,

1819
01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:40,889
artificial colors‐‐ Red 40 Lake,

1820
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:44,149
Yellow 6 Lake, Yellow 6, Yellow 5.

1821
01:29:44,150 --> 01:29:46,859
Because all of the yellows
taste so different.

1822
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:49,609
You know, I am disgusted at the poison

1823
01:29:49,610 --> 01:29:52,410
these corporations
try to pass off as food.

1824
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,119
‐ Who's watching the animals?

1825
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:58,329
‐ My therapist is taking care of them,
but we should have

1826
01:29:58,330 --> 01:30:01,290
a conversation about the fish
at some point.

1827
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:04,750
‐ What happened to the fish?

1828
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:08,880
‐ Let's look at gum.

1829
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:15,179
Okay, so I just want to
preface this by saying that

1830
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:17,099
nobody would disagree
that fish belong in the ocean.

1831
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:18,600
Correct?

1832
01:30:21,230 --> 01:30:23,059
‐ Abby.

1833
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:24,559
‐ H‐How did you even‐‐

1834
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:27,019
‐ I tracked you. John taught me.

1835
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:28,479
‐ I just want to go home.

1836
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,779
I know. I just‐‐

1837
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:33,160
Please, let me say this.

1838
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,449
You are my family.

1839
01:30:36,450 --> 01:30:40,449
I mean, you are the love of my life.

1840
01:30:40,450 --> 01:30:41,999
I was terrible.

1841
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,459
And‐and I wish that
I could undo everything,

1842
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:46,839
but I promise you
I will make it up to you.

1843
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:50,209
I will spend the rest of my life
making it up to you.

1844
01:30:50,210 --> 01:30:52,880
And I won't hurt you like this again.

1845
01:30:55,010 --> 01:30:57,639
But please...

1846
01:30:57,640 --> 01:30:59,469
give me another chance.

1847
01:30:59,470 --> 01:31:01,930
I‐I want to build a life with you.

1848
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:05,810
Please.

1849
01:31:07,810 --> 01:31:09,399
‐ And what about your parents? I‐‐

1850
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:11,439
‐ No, no, I...

1851
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:14,149
I don't care what they think.

1852
01:31:14,150 --> 01:31:16,530
I only care about you.

1853
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:20,490
If I have you, that's all I need.

1854
01:31:22,790 --> 01:31:24,500
Be with me.

1855
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:55,779
So, the Shadow Dreamers

1856
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:58,239
were compelled to rise up against Flanks.

1857
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:00,409
Because of the blatant
Thorfian rights violations.

1858
01:32:00,410 --> 01:32:01,789
‐ Exactly.

1859
01:32:01,790 --> 01:32:02,869
‐ Good morning.

1860
01:32:02,870 --> 01:32:04,159
‐ Hey, morning. Merry Christmas.
‐ Hi.

1861
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:06,119
‐ Morning.
‐ Hey, Mom.

1862
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:07,999
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi.

1863
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,209
How'd you sleep?

1864
01:32:09,210 --> 01:32:11,169
‐ Did he come down?

1865
01:32:11,170 --> 01:32:12,919
‐ No, not yet.

1866
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:14,339
Everyone.

1867
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:15,549
Go ahead, kids.

1868
01:32:15,550 --> 01:32:18,339
‐ We put the necklace in Abby's bag.

1869
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:19,969
We're sorry.

1870
01:32:19,970 --> 01:32:21,299
‐ Thank you.

1871
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:23,389
‐ Can we open our stockings now?

1872
01:32:23,390 --> 01:32:25,229
‐ Yes.
‐ Let's go.

1873
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:38,239
‐ Uh, I have sunk
almost all of our savings

1874
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:40,239
into this campaign.

1875
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:44,039
Because I thought, if I won,

1876
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:46,039
you'd all be proud of me.

1877
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:48,119
‐ We're already proud of you.

1878
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:50,379
‐ We don't care if you win.

1879
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:51,539
‐ Yeah.

1880
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:53,459
And the money doesn't matter.

1881
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:56,050
When I sell my book,
I'll take care of all of us.

1882
01:32:59,430 --> 01:33:02,219
‐ I love you, girls.

1883
01:33:02,220 --> 01:33:05,019
And I'm sorry for making you think

1884
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:08,100
that anything could ever
get in the way of that.

1885
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:10,769
I want to do better,

1886
01:33:10,770 --> 01:33:14,069
and it will take time,
but all I want for you

1887
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:16,189
is to find the same joy and happiness

1888
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:20,819
that you have given me,
no matter where it comes from.

1889
01:33:24,910 --> 01:33:26,699
Aw.

1890
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:29,579
Mm.

1891
01:33:41,430 --> 01:33:42,839
‐ Whoa!

1892
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:44,139
‐ Smile.

1893
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:45,509
Smile.

1894
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:46,809
Aw.

1895
01:33:46,810 --> 01:33:48,849
‐ You didn't think I knew
how to do that, did you?

1896
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:49,850
‐ I‐‐ It's impressive.

1897
01:34:07,370 --> 01:34:09,159
‐ Hello?
‐ Merry Christmas, Ted.

1898
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:10,749
‐ Merry‐‐
‐ I'll get right to it.

1899
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:13,289
I like you. I think you can win, too,

1900
01:34:13,290 --> 01:34:15,249
and not just this election.

1901
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:17,629
‐ Thank you, Ms. Levin.
‐ Hold on. There's an "if."

1902
01:34:17,630 --> 01:34:21,339
Now, I don't know if Sloane's
revelation last night was true,

1903
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:23,549
but if it is...

1904
01:34:23,550 --> 01:34:27,219
And Harper can adopt
a "don't ask, don't tell" policy

1905
01:34:27,220 --> 01:34:29,889
regarding her private life,

1906
01:34:29,890 --> 01:34:31,679
I think we could be in business.

1907
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:33,690
What do you say?

1908
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:47,329
‐ Well?

1909
01:34:47,330 --> 01:34:49,290
‐ It's not gonna work out.

1910
01:34:50,330 --> 01:34:51,579
‐ Oh.

1911
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:53,250
‐ We'll figure something out.

1912
01:34:57,790 --> 01:34:59,589
Great, so‐‐ Wait, come over here.

1913
01:34:59,590 --> 01:35:01,919
- Okay. Where am I? Here?
- You move there.

1914
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:04,089
- Yeah, okay. Okay.

1915
01:35:04,090 --> 01:35:06,139
Um, Jane, you get in the middle.

1916
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:07,140
‐ Yeah.

1917
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:09,599
Right there.

1918
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:11,349
John, would you mind?

1919
01:35:11,350 --> 01:35:13,439
‐ Oh, I would be delighted.

1920
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,559
Okay.

1921
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:17,899
‐ Abby, what are you doing way over there?

1922
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:19,519
Get in here.
‐ Come on.

1923
01:35:23,950 --> 01:35:26,319
‐ Okay. Everyone say, "Christmas."

1924
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,199
No, don't say that.

1925
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:40,089
"Once they cross Corvall Chasm,

1926
01:35:40,090 --> 01:35:42,259
"they will enter floam territory.

1927
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:45,679
"The Shadow Dreamers know
they might not all make it out

1928
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:47,469
"with their Krindoll intact,

1929
01:35:47,470 --> 01:35:51,509
"but the entire Thorfian race
rests on their shoulders.

1930
01:35:51,510 --> 01:35:56,019
"They look to each other
and then into the darkness.

1931
01:35:56,020 --> 01:35:59,479
It is Glank who takes the first step."

1932
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:09,369
‐ Here you go.
Thank you so much for coming.

1933
01:36:09,370 --> 01:36:10,409
Thank you.

1934
01:36:10,410 --> 01:36:11,989

1938
01:36:15,161 --> 01:36:16,369

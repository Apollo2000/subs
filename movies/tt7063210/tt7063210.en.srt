1
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:42,601
- I did what you asked.
- And what exactly did you do ?

2
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:45,121
I clobbered a guy.

3
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:49,041
- Who ?
- Who cares who, I did it!

4
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:51,001
Lower your voice.

5
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:54,841
More details, that was our deal.

6
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:00,961
There was a rally.

7
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:03,121
A brawl broke out so I stepped in.

8
00:03:03,561 --> 00:03:06,601
There was this kid
who was itching for a fight.

9
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:09,081
- So I obliged.
- Did you hurt him ?

10
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:12,801
- Quite a bit.
- Quite a bit isn't enough.

11
00:03:13,201 --> 00:03:15,121
Or you would've gotten what you want.

12
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:17,481
Listen, I need to find that money.

13
00:03:17,641 --> 00:03:19,961
Clobber a guy and you'll find it.

14
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:29,761
- Mrs. Marcella.
- Morning ! How are you ?

15
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:32,601
- Busy day.
- Good.

16
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:35,041
- How are things going ?
- Well.

17
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,561
- Find what you needed ?
- Yes.

18
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:41,241
It's amazing
what you can find online.

19
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:45,361
And they deliver to your home,
just like the corner store !

20
00:03:48,921 --> 00:03:50,321
Well...

21
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:53,601
I think it'll be ready in a week.

22
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:56,481
Moving ahead quickly.

23
00:03:56,721 --> 00:04:00,401
- Tell me more.
- The small pieces are the hardest.

24
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:03,881
I'm no longer good with my hands,

25
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,681
they shake.

26
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:09,921
And it's hard for me to concentrate.

27
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:12,201
What do you think about
while working ?

28
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:14,761
I'm scared.

29
00:04:15,561 --> 00:04:19,201
Yes, because I think about
all the people who will die

30
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:22,441
and this anguishes me.

31
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:27,481
You know... it'll happen
in a split second for them.

32
00:04:28,321 --> 00:04:30,761
But I think about their loved ones,

33
00:04:31,161 --> 00:04:33,281
those who are left behind...

34
00:04:35,481 --> 00:04:38,401
They'll suffer for quite some time.

35
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:41,721
Do you still want to do this ?

36
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,561
Of course I do.

37
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:47,961
I want my husband to come home.

38
00:04:48,961 --> 00:04:51,641
He will come home
when it's all done, right?

39
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:54,761
If you do what I asked, he will.

40
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:58,521
Do you force everyone who comes here...

41
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:01,721
to cause harm ?

42
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:05,241
No, not everyone.

43
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:15,281
Here you go,
salad with tuna and tomatoes.

44
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:16,601
Thanks.

45
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:19,401
- And a diet Coke.
- Thanks.

46
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:45,921
- Pick someone ?
- Yes.

47
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:51,641
This is her name and address.

48
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:03,201
How old ?

49
00:06:03,361 --> 00:06:04,961
She's six...

50
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:06,481
Why her ?

51
00:06:06,961 --> 00:06:08,401
She's a little girl.

52
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,841
- But why her ?
- I don't know.

53
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:14,001
She's young, she just started life,

54
00:06:14,161 --> 00:06:16,601
her parents are young
and will get over it.

55
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:20,201
I saw her playing at the park.
Enough, please.

56
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:29,561
- The plan ?
- I followed them home.

57
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:31,321
The girl and her parents.

58
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:35,721
- I don't know if I can do it.
- You don't have to.

59
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:37,921
If I don't, my son dies.

60
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:47,321
Tell me one thing...

61
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:48,961
What ?

62
00:06:49,361 --> 00:06:52,561
How do I know
that you're not the devil ?

63
00:06:56,761 --> 00:06:58,721
You don't.

64
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:08,281
I've been a nun for 11 years.

65
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:11,441
I got the calling
when I was just a kid.

66
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:15,321
I always wanted to take my vows.
I felt God's presence.

67
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:17,761
Everywhere.

68
00:07:19,881 --> 00:07:21,601
What did you feel ?

69
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,481
Him.

70
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:26,241
<i>A sense of comfort.</i>

71
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:27,961
Constantly.

72
00:07:30,721 --> 00:07:33,721
And I no longer feel it.
I lost it.

73
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:36,921
- Want to leave the order ?
- No.

74
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:40,721
I want to feel God again.

75
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,841
Can you help ?

76
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:44,761
Yes.

77
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:48,121
- What do I have to do ?
- Let's see...

78
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:55,921
Get pregnant.

79
00:07:58,201 --> 00:07:59,441
I'm a nun !

80
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:03,641
If you want to feel God again
you have to get pregnant.

81
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:05,401
I can't.

82
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:07,761
Technically, you can.

83
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:11,041
You're asking me to sleep with a man,
that's absurd !

84
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:16,561
You just asked me
to help you feel God again.

85
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:27,641
If I do it, I'll feel God again ?

86
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:29,761
Just like before.

87
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:45,241
I don't know how to pull off a robbery.

88
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:48,001
Newborns don't know how to walk...
just do it.

89
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:51,281
Nonsense, give me something else,
I won't steal.

90
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:55,081
- Then don't.
- But I want to be prettier.

91
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:57,761
Then do what I said.
Quit wasting my time.

92
00:08:58,201 --> 00:08:59,281
Damn it.

93
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:04,321
Well, I have a friend who lives
in a mansion in the suburbs.

94
00:09:04,481 --> 00:09:06,841
Saturday we went dancing

95
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:10,361
and she mentioned her grandma
left her diamonds and jewels.

96
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:14,881
If I steal them and sell them,
is that okay ?

97
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:17,681
Sure, so long as it's 100,000 and...

98
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:20,001
Five cents, got it.

99
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:24,081
- What'll you do with that five cents ?
- Like I said, it's not for me.

100
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:27,881
You really think
I'm capable of doing this ?

101
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,721
I think people are capable
of more than they think.

102
00:09:31,761 --> 00:09:33,321
If you say so...

103
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:36,681
You think being prettier
will make you happier ?

104
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,441
Yes.

105
00:09:40,241 --> 00:09:42,561
And ifl get caught, I'll blame you.

106
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:45,121
- No, you won't.
- I will.

107
00:09:45,281 --> 00:09:47,081
I'm sure you won't.

108
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:01,761
Well ? Have you made a decision ?

109
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:03,841
Yes.

110
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:12,881
I picked her.

111
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:18,561
- Why her ?
- Well...

112
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:20,441
I have four posters in my garage,

113
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:22,521
Amanda was the first.

114
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:26,401
I have coffee with her every morning,
it seemed only fair to pick her.

115
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:31,161
Amanda it is.
You want her to love you ?

116
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:32,881
Love ? No !

117
00:10:33,161 --> 00:10:34,921
I wouldn't know how to handle that.

118
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:37,321
I want one night with her.

119
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:40,441
One night? It's doable.

120
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:54,001
You have to help a little girl.

121
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:59,401
Help a little girl... do what?

122
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:01,401
If you want a night with Amanda,

123
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:05,521
become part of a little girl's life
and protect her, like a guardian angel.

124
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:06,961
Protect her from what ?

125
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,601
Everything that's out there.

126
00:11:11,161 --> 00:11:13,641
- Any girl ?
- No.

127
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:18,321
This one.

128
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:23,081
- For how long ?
- 2 weeks.

129
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,281
Fine.

130
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:32,001
What happens if I don't do it?

131
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:35,681
- Things would move forward.
- How so ?

132
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:37,921
Your husband's Alzheimer's
could progress...

133
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,161
or it could reverse.

134
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:45,001
Doctors say there's no reversing it.

135
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:50,441
They also say nobody survives
a plane crash, but it has happened.

136
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:54,121
Couldn't I do something else ?

137
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:58,201
Instead of using this dreadful...

138
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:01,241
thing I am making ?

139
00:12:02,241 --> 00:12:04,281
No, you have to use the bomb.

140
00:12:07,281 --> 00:12:08,801
Where will you put it?

141
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:15,481
In a new diner
that opened in my neighborhood.

142
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:18,361
It's called Green Apple,
it's vegan.

143
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,401
I think I'll place it there

144
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:24,481
because on the weekends
it's very crowded.

145
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:27,441
- You'll do it on the weekend ?
- Yes.

146
00:12:27,601 --> 00:12:32,361
That way I'll kill the number
of people you requested.

147
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:55,761
- I don't want the girl to suffer.
- You decide how to do it.

148
00:12:56,281 --> 00:12:58,081
Something really quick...

149
00:12:59,121 --> 00:13:01,081
a bag on her head.

150
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,961
What do you think '2

151
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:06,761
What do you think?

152
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,121
Listen...

153
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:12,041
If I kill the little girl

154
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:16,041
and get caught,
will my son survive anyway ?

155
00:13:16,481 --> 00:13:17,961
Absolutely.

156
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:21,241
And if I end up in jail ?

157
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:24,601
- Be careful.
- I'm a good father.

158
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:27,641
I don't want my son
or wife to hate me.

159
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:34,801
Is this what you wanted to know ?
The details that matter to you ?

160
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:37,521
These are important things, Luigi.

161
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:39,521
Your thoughts.

162
00:13:49,321 --> 00:13:52,201
This time I really did it,
I clobbered a guy.

163
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:54,561
Tell me about it.

164
00:13:56,481 --> 00:13:59,081
I was working the night shift
at the precinct.

165
00:13:59,481 --> 00:14:01,241
Two dealers were booked.

166
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:03,521
One was shouting, protesting...

167
00:14:03,681 --> 00:14:07,121
I provoked him, he struck back,
so I used my club.

168
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:11,361
- In front of everyone ?
- No, just his friend.

169
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:13,801
My partner was out smoking.

170
00:14:14,961 --> 00:14:16,201
Was it hard ?

171
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,961
You know it was,
or you wouldn't have made me do it.

172
00:14:21,601 --> 00:14:23,161
Think I'm sadistic ?

173
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:26,241
No, I'm thinking about
getting back the robbery money.

174
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:28,761
I broke a few of his ribs,

175
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,721
and tore his retina,
he'll probably lose the eye.

176
00:14:31,881 --> 00:14:34,081
- I think that's enough.
- Indeed.

177
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,281
- My money ?
- It's coming soon.

178
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:37,641
When ?

179
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:39,441
Answer.

180
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:42,321
- Huh ?
- Answer your phone.

181
00:14:52,721 --> 00:14:54,161
Hello ?

182
00:14:56,681 --> 00:14:58,481
Coming.

183
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:03,281
It was the precinct,
there's news on the robbery.

184
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:05,641
You'll get your money.

185
00:15:06,841 --> 00:15:08,201
Or I'll hunt you down.

186
00:15:08,521 --> 00:15:11,841
Don't worry,
this is our goodbye.

187
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:26,641
- Anything else ?
- Yes.

188
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,401
Another coffee.

189
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:31,681
You drank six today, that's a lot.

190
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:34,881
You counted ?

191
00:15:38,201 --> 00:15:42,121
You sit here all day long.
What do you do for work ? I'm curious.

192
00:15:44,681 --> 00:15:46,721
Not much of a talker, I see.

193
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,881
Lemme guess.

194
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:52,201
If I guess will you tell me ?

195
00:15:52,921 --> 00:15:53,961
<i>TYY'</i>

196
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,041
<i>Okay...</i>

197
00:15:57,601 --> 00:16:00,681
you talk with lots of people,
you take notes,

198
00:16:01,801 --> 00:16:04,481
I think you're some kind of shrink...

199
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:08,681
You want to create
a friendly environment.

200
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:12,441
Like those alternative approaches
I read about online.

201
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:14,961
Am I right?

202
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:17,241
No.

203
00:16:18,121 --> 00:16:21,601
To be honest,
you seem anything but friendly.

204
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:27,121
I'm sorry you've gotten
that impression.

205
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:32,201
"I'm sorry you've gotten
that impression".

206
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:33,841
I can't figure you out,

207
00:16:34,001 --> 00:16:36,561
usually I'm really good at it

208
00:16:36,721 --> 00:16:38,721
but you're tricky.

209
00:16:40,121 --> 00:16:42,041
I'll take that as a compliment.

210
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,321
Suit yourself.

211
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:46,001
This skill of mine is useless anyway,

212
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:49,001
look where I am...
this says it all.

213
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,121
You're unhappy ?

214
00:16:55,441 --> 00:16:56,681
Some question...

215
00:16:57,361 --> 00:16:59,681
It's not nice to ask that.

216
00:17:00,881 --> 00:17:03,521
It's like asking someone's age,
even worse !

217
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:05,561
Sorry.

218
00:17:05,921 --> 00:17:09,681
Sorry, I'm really exhausted,
I didn't mean to...

219
00:17:20,761 --> 00:17:22,641
Found her.

220
00:17:23,641 --> 00:17:25,121
I went to the address you gave me,

221
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:27,241
and watched the girl from my car.

222
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:29,921
She was playing with her dad
in their courtyard.

223
00:17:31,161 --> 00:17:33,561
The girl, her dad, the dog.

224
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:36,961
It was like my windshield was a screen

225
00:17:37,121 --> 00:17:38,601
and I was watching a nice film.

226
00:17:39,121 --> 00:17:43,241
You could've asked for
a happy family too, with Amanda...

227
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:45,561
I'm not cut out for that.

228
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:49,001
What happiness do you want?

229
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:53,281
I never thought about it...

230
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:57,161
A family scares me,
I prefer my ladies on the wall.

231
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,161
What scares you exactly ?

232
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:03,801
Having to take care of someone.

233
00:18:04,961 --> 00:18:09,121
Does someone want to hurt the girl,
is that why I'm doing this ?

234
00:18:09,281 --> 00:18:11,201
Dunno, it's not my problem.

235
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:14,601
- Whose is it ?
- Yours, and yours alone.

236
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:19,001
It's up to you
if you'll accept or walk away.

237
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:30,041
You must rape a woman.

238
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:33,401
What ?

239
00:18:33,561 --> 00:18:35,921
To get what you want,
you must rape a woman.

240
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:40,281
I would never do such a thing.

241
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:42,361
- Okay.
- What's that mean ?

242
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:44,681
Don't dash my hopes.

243
00:18:44,841 --> 00:18:47,441
I didn't, there's still hope.

244
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:50,881
Accept or walk away,
it's up to you.

245
00:18:57,801 --> 00:18:59,481
Who are you ?

246
00:18:59,961 --> 00:19:03,601
- That doesn't matter.
- You have a kind voice.

247
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:07,881
Why ask me to do
such a wicked thing ?

248
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,921
- It makes no sense.
- Things don't always make sense.

249
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:13,601
Can't you give me another task ?

250
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:15,081
No.

251
00:19:16,881 --> 00:19:18,881
I will not rape a woman.

252
00:19:21,521 --> 00:19:23,401
That's not who I am.

253
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:48,681
I found a couple.

254
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,161
They're not really friends,
but I know them well.

255
00:19:52,481 --> 00:19:54,881
They're neighbors,
we've gone on double dates.

256
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:57,401
It should be easy to break them up.

257
00:19:57,561 --> 00:19:59,161
Why <i>'2</i>

258
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:00,921
They're on the edge.

259
00:20:01,081 --> 00:20:03,041
They're lifeless, bored,

260
00:20:03,281 --> 00:20:06,241
very polite with each other
but the passion is clearly gone.

261
00:20:06,521 --> 00:20:07,961
- Got a plan ?
- Yes.

262
00:20:08,121 --> 00:20:11,801
His name is Andrea,
he works from home

263
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,481
selling policies online.

264
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:16,321
I'll go there tomorrow
saying I want a new insurance.

265
00:20:16,761 --> 00:20:18,521
His wife's a teacher,
she won't be home.

266
00:20:18,921 --> 00:20:20,801
And then what?

267
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:22,801
I'll act interested, provoke him...

268
00:20:23,161 --> 00:20:25,961
Then I'll send him
some texts at night.

269
00:20:26,521 --> 00:20:29,241
I'll invite him over
and make sure his wife finds us.

270
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:31,401
- Finds you ?
- Yes... in bed.

271
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:34,361
I don't plan on going
all the way with him.

272
00:20:34,521 --> 00:20:37,601
She just needs to walk in
before we do it, right ?

273
00:20:37,761 --> 00:20:40,001
What matters is
one of the two leaves home.

274
00:20:40,801 --> 00:20:42,521
I'm sure she'll kick him out.

275
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:45,161
This doesn't bother you ?

276
00:20:45,441 --> 00:20:48,281
No, like I said, they're unhappy.
I'm doing them a favor.

277
00:20:48,601 --> 00:20:50,041
A favor ?

278
00:20:58,121 --> 00:20:59,601
I have news.

279
00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:01,961
Okay.

280
00:21:02,121 --> 00:21:05,521
I went out dancing again
with the friend I want to steal from.

281
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,401
I'm hanging out with her often

282
00:21:07,561 --> 00:21:10,001
so it won't seem odd
when I ask to sleep over.

283
00:21:10,161 --> 00:21:12,481
Anyway, I met a guy at the club.

284
00:21:13,081 --> 00:21:16,161
- A guy ?
- He gave me a pill for free.

285
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:18,001
He's cute.

286
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:19,881
I gave him my number.

287
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:22,561
What does he have to do with it ?

288
00:21:22,761 --> 00:21:24,921
Let me finish telling you !

289
00:21:25,681 --> 00:21:28,321
We went out twice.

290
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,761
He's handsome...

291
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:31,961
and he's sharp.

292
00:21:32,121 --> 00:21:34,121
He deals LSD.

293
00:21:34,281 --> 00:21:37,001
He's a small-time crook,
he's having money problems.

294
00:21:37,481 --> 00:21:40,801
So I wanted to ask you
if he could help me.

295
00:21:40,961 --> 00:21:43,801
- You decide how to do it.
- Then I will ask him.

296
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,161
- Think he'll do it?
- Yes, it's an easy job.

297
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:50,761
Since you don't need the money,
I'll give it to him.

298
00:21:54,281 --> 00:21:55,361
Coffee ?

299
00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:57,281
No, thanks.

300
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:03,201
What ?

301
00:22:03,561 --> 00:22:06,441
I like how you listen to people,
it's impressive.

302
00:22:08,721 --> 00:22:10,441
They really open up to you.

303
00:22:12,921 --> 00:22:15,441
When they leave, they seem...

304
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:18,281
transfixed.

305
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:21,961
Transfixed ?

306
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:26,041
That's an odd word.

307
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:30,641
Yes.

308
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:32,281
It just came to me.

309
00:22:41,001 --> 00:22:43,561
I'm working as a barman
by the girl's building.

310
00:22:44,121 --> 00:22:45,481
I've got a perfect view.

311
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:48,841
- As a barman ?
- Part-time. I get paid peanuts.

312
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:51,521
- What about your garage ?
- I have a plan...

313
00:22:52,201 --> 00:22:54,881
I follow her to school in the morning,
then go to the garage.

314
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:59,521
After school, I follow Matilde home
and work at the bar till 8:00 PM.

315
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:03,481
- So I can keep an eye on her.
- You're getting into it.

316
00:23:03,641 --> 00:23:07,641
I'm not enjoying it,
but at least I'll get Amanda.

317
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:10,001
Happy to have an objective ?

318
00:23:12,201 --> 00:23:13,721
The outcome is what I want.

319
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,201
Will I need a weapon ?

320
00:23:18,841 --> 00:23:19,801
A weapon ?

321
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:23,041
You said I have to protect her
from a bad guy.

322
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,441
I never said that.

323
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:29,721
You never say anything, do you ?
Sly fox...

324
00:23:30,801 --> 00:23:32,641
You're free to back out.

325
00:23:44,641 --> 00:23:46,521
Why are you here ?

326
00:23:46,681 --> 00:23:48,441
- He fled.
- Who ?

327
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,041
The guy I was after
who stole the money.

328
00:23:53,001 --> 00:23:54,881
- Did you get the money ?
- Yes.

329
00:23:55,721 --> 00:23:57,681
- That's what you wanted.
- I wanted him too.

330
00:23:57,841 --> 00:24:00,521
- You asked for the money.
- I wanted the thief too.

331
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:02,921
- You weren't clear.
- Where is he ?

332
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:05,681
- Who knows.
- You fucking know !

333
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:07,081
- No.
- You know!

334
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:09,361
Calm down.

335
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:19,121
Last night, my partner and I
were on duty.

336
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:21,001
We got a tip-off.

337
00:24:21,441 --> 00:24:23,921
We went to this sort of warehouse

338
00:24:24,721 --> 00:24:27,641
but he heard us coming,
he left the money and fled.

339
00:24:28,081 --> 00:24:30,441
- Why are you lying ?
- I'm not lying.

340
00:24:30,641 --> 00:24:32,281
Who's the thief?

341
00:24:33,601 --> 00:24:37,241
- Tell me who he is.
- I'm sick of your fucking games.

342
00:24:37,401 --> 00:24:40,601
- Tell me where he is.
- I told you I have no idea.

343
00:24:41,721 --> 00:24:44,681
I almost killed someone for you.

344
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:48,281
Let's get things straight:

345
00:24:48,601 --> 00:24:51,881
you almost killed someone
for you, not me.

346
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:55,761
Do you expect me
to pull another stupid fucking stunt?

347
00:24:56,841 --> 00:24:59,521
Another one of your shitty deals ?

348
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:02,521
Listen, fuck off. Write that down.

349
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:25,481
How's it going ?

350
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:27,961
- Not well.
- Why ?

351
00:25:28,681 --> 00:25:30,281
I went to some night clubs

352
00:25:31,601 --> 00:25:34,561
but only met drunk men
who wanted to take me to bed.

353
00:25:36,961 --> 00:25:39,961
- You just have to get pregnant.
- Not like that.

354
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:44,081
If I'm going to do it,
I want him to be someone I like.

355
00:25:44,521 --> 00:25:45,721
That's not required.

356
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:48,001
For me it is.

357
00:25:52,521 --> 00:25:54,961
It's too hard to find a man.

358
00:25:56,001 --> 00:25:58,001
- I understand.
- You understand ?

359
00:26:00,281 --> 00:26:01,641
If you understood...

360
00:26:01,881 --> 00:26:05,041
if you really can make me
feel God again, then just do it.

361
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:08,081
- I can't.
- I beg you.

362
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:10,241
Just do what I asked.

363
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:12,481
- You can't force me.
- I'm not.

364
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:14,641
I took vows.

365
00:26:16,761 --> 00:26:19,721
Then keep them
and continue living without God.

366
00:26:20,401 --> 00:26:21,681
Or break them...

367
00:26:22,841 --> 00:26:25,441
get pregnant,
put the baby up for adoption,

368
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:27,521
find God again, and be a nun.

369
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:30,681
- Nobody will ever know.
- I'll know.

370
00:26:30,961 --> 00:26:33,761
And like you said... my Lord.

371
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:37,601
Do you have one ?

372
00:26:38,561 --> 00:26:40,041
We all have one.

373
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:56,201
The bomb is ready.

374
00:26:56,361 --> 00:26:58,121
- Ready ?
- Yes.

375
00:26:58,281 --> 00:26:59,881
I took it to Green Apple.

376
00:27:04,401 --> 00:27:05,601
But you didn't detonate.

377
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:11,001
Who am I to kill so many people
just to have my husband back ?

378
00:27:13,641 --> 00:27:15,561
- You can back out.
- I know.

379
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:19,281
But then I thought:
Who am I not to do it?

380
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:23,801
Lots of people kill,
in one way or another,

381
00:27:23,961 --> 00:27:26,281
to get what they want...

382
00:27:26,721 --> 00:27:28,321
So...

383
00:27:28,561 --> 00:27:30,601
I'll go back there

384
00:27:31,641 --> 00:27:33,721
next weekend.

385
00:27:38,481 --> 00:27:40,801
Someone is watching the girl.

386
00:27:45,161 --> 00:27:46,121
Aman.

387
00:27:46,641 --> 00:27:49,601
I saw him following her.
The barman who works by her house.

388
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:53,801
I see him at school, by her home,
at the pool, everywhere.

389
00:27:53,961 --> 00:27:56,321
Wherever she goes, he goes.

390
00:27:57,161 --> 00:27:58,201
The barman ?

391
00:27:58,361 --> 00:28:01,001
I know it seems crazy,
but I'm sure of it.

392
00:28:05,481 --> 00:28:07,321
Can I pick a new kid ?

393
00:28:08,601 --> 00:28:10,521
- No.
- Come on !

394
00:28:13,001 --> 00:28:15,001
I'll pick a new kid and save my son !

395
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:17,161
Once you start you can't change.

396
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,721
- What about him ?
- These are the rules.

397
00:28:20,321 --> 00:28:22,041
Maybe he knows...

398
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,201
did you tell anyone about me ?

399
00:28:24,361 --> 00:28:26,001
- No.
- Are you sure ?

400
00:28:26,161 --> 00:28:27,001
Stop it.

401
00:28:28,121 --> 00:28:29,601
I noticed something...

402
00:28:30,881 --> 00:28:34,121
whenever the girl lags behind
or throws a tantrum,

403
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:36,801
her parents yell and hit her.

404
00:28:37,241 --> 00:28:38,921
Hit her ?

405
00:28:39,081 --> 00:28:40,841
They slap her.

406
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:42,761
If they do this in public,

407
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,441
they do worse at home.

408
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:47,201
That makes you feel better ?

409
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:49,321
It's crazy, I know.

410
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:04,761
- I met her.
- Who ?

411
00:29:05,241 --> 00:29:07,721
- The calendar lady.
- You met her ?

412
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:09,121
Yes !

413
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:12,841
She drove into to my garage
this morning with a flat tire.

414
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,601
The car door opens and out she comes...

415
00:29:16,281 --> 00:29:19,081
It was her, Amanda !

416
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,761
I didn't say a word,
I put her car on the auto lift,

417
00:29:23,921 --> 00:29:26,601
she saw her poster on the wall
and said:

418
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:29,641
"That's an old picture,
I'll give you a new one".

419
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,281
- Good.
- She was so nice.

420
00:29:32,441 --> 00:29:34,321
She didn't treat me like a mechanic.

421
00:29:34,641 --> 00:29:37,321
This is proof.
Because I'm doing my task well ?

422
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:40,481
- Probably.
- You're not sure ?

423
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:42,361
I'm not in control.

424
00:29:42,601 --> 00:29:45,041
- Huh ?
- Things don't depend on me.

425
00:29:45,601 --> 00:29:48,281
You're just a middle man ?

426
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:55,121
Who's on the other side,
will you tell me ?

427
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:08,561
It's my son.

428
00:30:11,001 --> 00:30:13,881
- Your son ?
- The man I'm looking for is my son.

429
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:18,561
He left home <i>2</i> years ago,
we're estranged.

430
00:30:19,241 --> 00:30:22,201
He just does these things
to provoke me.

431
00:30:22,681 --> 00:30:24,001
He's the robber ?

432
00:30:25,321 --> 00:30:26,561
He's not a criminal.

433
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:28,801
I need to find him

434
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:31,241
before he fucks up and gets shot.

435
00:30:32,361 --> 00:30:34,401
Want to make a new deal ?

436
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:57,121
If you want to find your son

437
00:30:57,601 --> 00:31:00,041
cover up a violent crime
reported by a woman.

438
00:31:02,201 --> 00:31:03,441
This sounds like bullshit.

439
00:31:06,121 --> 00:31:09,961
A woman comes and reports
a violent crime, you cover it up.

440
00:31:10,121 --> 00:31:11,921
Get rid of it.

441
00:31:12,361 --> 00:31:14,601
That's a serious crime.
I've done my share.

442
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,521
New request, new deal.

443
00:31:18,321 --> 00:31:20,201
Does it have to be a woman ?

444
00:31:21,681 --> 00:31:23,041
Yes.

445
00:31:24,281 --> 00:31:26,681
Why do you ask such awful things ?

446
00:31:27,961 --> 00:31:29,881
Because someone is always willing.

447
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:54,161
I was right.

448
00:31:54,361 --> 00:31:57,441
- About?
- Alex. The guy I told you about.

449
00:32:00,161 --> 00:32:03,041
- The sharp LSD dealer ?
- Yes.

450
00:32:03,441 --> 00:32:05,801
I asked him to help me
and he said yes.

451
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:10,041
Happy to have an accomplice ?

452
00:32:10,201 --> 00:32:11,481
Of course.

453
00:32:11,641 --> 00:32:14,121
I can't do it alone,
her house is full of servants.

454
00:32:14,401 --> 00:32:17,321
Plus, he's not an accomplice,
you make it sound shady.

455
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:22,121
I told him about my plan.
Know what he said ?

456
00:32:22,281 --> 00:32:23,561
No...

457
00:32:23,721 --> 00:32:26,441
That it's a great plan and I'm smart.

458
00:32:26,601 --> 00:32:29,441
You're happy
because he said you're smart ?

459
00:32:29,961 --> 00:32:31,921
No, not just for that.

460
00:32:32,841 --> 00:32:34,521
I want to confide in you.

461
00:32:35,881 --> 00:32:36,841
Go on.

462
00:32:37,001 --> 00:32:39,281
No pen, it's personal.

463
00:32:44,521 --> 00:32:47,841
We made love, it was amazing.

464
00:32:48,641 --> 00:32:51,961
Amazing and desperate at the same time.

465
00:32:52,561 --> 00:32:55,361
- Why desperate ?
- He cried after.

466
00:32:55,521 --> 00:32:58,881
He hugged me tight and cried.
And I cried too.

467
00:33:00,121 --> 00:33:02,281
I don't want him to ever leave me.

468
00:33:04,601 --> 00:33:06,201
We can change your request.

469
00:33:06,561 --> 00:33:10,721
Even your magic wouldn't save me,
I always get dumped.

470
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:16,721
But if I become prettier,
he won't leave me.

471
00:33:20,361 --> 00:33:22,921
Gotta go, he's waiting for me.

472
00:33:47,961 --> 00:33:51,201
Eskimos have seven ways
of saying "white".

473
00:33:51,361 --> 00:33:53,001
Did you know ?

474
00:33:53,521 --> 00:33:54,521
No.

475
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:56,801
And I only have one color.

476
00:33:56,961 --> 00:33:59,921
Actually, black isn't
even technically a color.

477
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:02,081
Want to make a deal?

478
00:34:02,801 --> 00:34:06,201
If it's the only way
to get my sight back, I'll try.

479
00:34:06,521 --> 00:34:08,001
Think you won't manage ?

480
00:34:08,761 --> 00:34:11,361
Even the simplest of things
are hard for me.

481
00:34:11,521 --> 00:34:14,201
And what you're asking me
to do is awful

482
00:34:14,361 --> 00:34:15,801
and it requires precise preparations.

483
00:34:16,241 --> 00:34:18,601
- Have you chosen a woman ?
- No.

484
00:34:19,681 --> 00:34:24,121
It obviously can't be someone I know
but she has to trust me.

485
00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:28,321
I can't just improvise,
at least not until the end.

486
00:34:29,641 --> 00:34:31,001
It'll be hard.

487
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:40,761
- What are you thinking about?
- Your face.

488
00:34:42,801 --> 00:34:44,481
What face are you making ?

489
00:34:47,401 --> 00:34:48,761
Can I touch your face ?

490
00:34:49,081 --> 00:34:50,481
No.

491
00:34:54,481 --> 00:34:56,921
I bet you're sad.

492
00:35:07,241 --> 00:35:08,801
How was your day ?

493
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:10,761
Fine, thanks.

494
00:35:11,441 --> 00:35:14,121
- More coffee ?
- Gladly.

495
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:17,361
I knew it.

496
00:35:18,561 --> 00:35:20,281
Thanks.

497
00:35:24,321 --> 00:35:25,761
Why don't you go home ?

498
00:35:28,841 --> 00:35:30,361
Nobody waiting for you ?

499
00:35:33,321 --> 00:35:36,081
Do you ask all customers
questions like these ?

500
00:35:36,241 --> 00:35:38,081
You intrigue me.

501
00:35:40,161 --> 00:35:42,321
What exactly intrigues you ?

502
00:35:42,561 --> 00:35:45,361
You seem tired, exhausted.

503
00:35:45,641 --> 00:35:47,201
Like you haven't slept in ages.

504
00:35:48,401 --> 00:35:50,241
I haven't.

505
00:35:52,601 --> 00:35:55,521
See ?
I am good at figuring people out.

506
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:12,121
I went to Andrea's.

507
00:36:12,281 --> 00:36:15,921
He helped me with the insurance,
he was super nice.

508
00:36:16,161 --> 00:36:18,361
I accepted a glass of wine,
played coy.

509
00:36:18,881 --> 00:36:20,761
He was flirting too, for sure.

510
00:36:22,601 --> 00:36:25,041
- And then ?
- I texted him at night.

511
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:29,201
He replied. He was cautious
but interested, for sure.

512
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:30,921
Details ?

513
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:35,481
I wrote:

514
00:36:35,721 --> 00:36:39,361
"Does an insurance
for happiness exist ?" Smiley face.

515
00:36:39,521 --> 00:36:41,801
Him: "Unfortunately not."
Sad face.

516
00:36:41,961 --> 00:36:44,361
Me: "And for love ?"
Him: "Too risky."

517
00:36:44,521 --> 00:36:48,561
"You want that kind of insurance ?"
Me: "No00oo !"

518
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:49,841
"I like risking".

519
00:36:50,321 --> 00:36:53,361
I sent a devil emoticon.
After a while he sent me one too.

520
00:36:54,201 --> 00:36:57,281
At that point,
I asked if I could stop by again

521
00:36:57,441 --> 00:36:59,681
for more information on insurance.

522
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:01,881
This time my intentions were clear.

523
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:04,921
But when I tried to kiss him,
he pulled away.

524
00:37:05,721 --> 00:37:08,921
- And you ?
- I tried to insist and make light of it.

525
00:37:09,081 --> 00:37:12,281
I said everyone has a fling
every now and then.

526
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:14,281
Bad move, he got all uptight.

527
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,481
He looked at me as if...

528
00:37:16,721 --> 00:37:18,601
he pitied me.

529
00:37:19,881 --> 00:37:20,841
Did he say that ?

530
00:37:21,721 --> 00:37:26,041
He said he hasn't looked
at another woman for 20 years.

531
00:37:26,241 --> 00:37:30,121
He's happy and wouldn't ruin
his marriage for the world.

532
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:31,521
What a drag !

533
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:32,721
Are you angW 7

534
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:34,441
Yes, he offended me.

535
00:37:34,601 --> 00:37:36,401
He didn't have to judge me.

536
00:37:36,561 --> 00:37:40,281
All that shit he said about couples
made me feel judged.

537
00:37:40,441 --> 00:37:43,201
Isn't that what you want?

538
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:46,601
A husband crazy about his own wife ?

539
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:51,281
I met a man.

540
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:55,721
I thought you'd given up.

541
00:37:56,281 --> 00:37:58,081
I won't give up on God.

542
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,001
Tell me more.

543
00:38:01,161 --> 00:38:02,681
I was at mass,

544
00:38:02,841 --> 00:38:05,201
a guy was sitting alone in the back.

545
00:38:05,361 --> 00:38:08,321
I noticed him
because he was praying intensely.

546
00:38:08,481 --> 00:38:10,921
I sat down next to him
after mass.

547
00:38:11,441 --> 00:38:13,881
I obviously didn't tell him I'm a nun.

548
00:38:14,241 --> 00:38:16,241
I just said hi.

549
00:38:16,881 --> 00:38:19,441
He said I have a nice voice,

550
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:22,481
a clean voice.

551
00:38:23,241 --> 00:38:24,841
We talked so much.

552
00:38:25,881 --> 00:38:27,721
I felt totally at ease.

553
00:38:28,361 --> 00:38:30,121
What'd you talk about?

554
00:38:33,281 --> 00:38:34,961
God.

555
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:37,121
Odd, right ?

556
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:41,041
Will you see him again ?

557
00:38:41,441 --> 00:38:44,681
He asked if I wanted
to meet him for coffee.

558
00:38:44,881 --> 00:38:47,481
- What did you say ?
- That I don't drink coffee.

559
00:38:47,641 --> 00:38:48,961
It makes me jumpy.

560
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:52,441
He laughed and said:
"How about some juice ?"

561
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:56,361
So he invited me to a place
near his house tomorrow night.

562
00:38:56,841 --> 00:38:58,241
What place ?

563
00:38:59,481 --> 00:39:03,561
A vegan diner called Green Apple,
know it ?

564
00:39:03,721 --> 00:39:05,561
I've heard of it.

565
00:39:06,321 --> 00:39:07,961
I think he's the right one.

566
00:39:08,601 --> 00:39:10,441
How can you be sure?

567
00:39:11,161 --> 00:39:13,321
Because I'm not ashamed with him.

568
00:39:13,761 --> 00:39:15,241
Why not ?

569
00:39:15,681 --> 00:39:16,961
He's blind.

570
00:39:20,321 --> 00:39:21,721
Blind?

571
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:22,881
Yes.

572
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:30,081
Alex, the guy I told you about.

573
00:39:31,801 --> 00:39:34,441
Martina said you make
people's dreams come true.

574
00:39:34,601 --> 00:39:36,521
Let's just say I offer people a chance.

575
00:39:36,761 --> 00:39:38,041
Bullshit.

576
00:39:38,241 --> 00:39:40,281
Give it a try, ask something.

577
00:39:40,481 --> 00:39:41,801
Is that okay ?

578
00:39:42,161 --> 00:39:45,121
- How do I know you're not a fake ?
- I'm telling you.

579
00:39:45,601 --> 00:39:47,761
Okay.

580
00:39:49,081 --> 00:39:50,401
Prove it.

581
00:39:52,521 --> 00:39:56,321
People normally come here
out of their own will.

582
00:39:56,481 --> 00:39:58,201
I'm here because I chose to come.

583
00:39:58,921 --> 00:40:01,081
Because I wanted to.

584
00:40:01,561 --> 00:40:03,361
Come on, prove it.

585
00:40:10,881 --> 00:40:13,761
Tell me something simple
you'd like right now.

586
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:16,481
The security codes to hack Amazon.

587
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:20,041
- I said something simple.
- Fine.

588
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:21,961
Flowers for Martina.

589
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:24,121
Doable.

590
00:40:24,561 --> 00:40:26,041
Doable...

591
00:40:30,521 --> 00:40:33,041
Help ten ladies cross the street.

592
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:36,921
- Huh ?
- Do it, it's easy.

593
00:40:40,081 --> 00:40:42,201
Okay, let's do it.

594
00:40:46,641 --> 00:40:51,921
I can't believe you pushed me
to do such a ghastly thing.

595
00:40:52,081 --> 00:40:53,161
I didn't push.

596
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:55,881
Of course, you didn't force me,

597
00:40:57,321 --> 00:41:00,241
but at time we're not really free
to choose,

598
00:41:00,721 --> 00:41:03,801
because the mere idea
of having a possibility

599
00:41:04,801 --> 00:41:08,521
can push us in the wrong direction.

600
00:41:09,281 --> 00:41:12,481
There's something horrible
in all of us

601
00:41:12,641 --> 00:41:16,001
and those who aren't forced to face it

602
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:18,881
are very lucky.

603
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:24,001
I'm old, I almost managed to avoid it

604
00:41:24,561 --> 00:41:29,601
but my demon showed up
at the very end.

605
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:36,601
Anyway, it'll happen tomorrow
at that diner.

606
00:41:37,961 --> 00:41:41,481
Get ready to give back my husband.

607
00:41:56,401 --> 00:41:59,481
I was watching the girl
while working at the bar

608
00:41:59,961 --> 00:42:01,721
when her dad came outside,

609
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:04,681
grabbed her hand
and took her toward their car.

610
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,801
I saw a guy watching them from a car.

611
00:42:09,161 --> 00:42:10,721
Watching them ?

612
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:13,641
I'd seen him before,
but I wasn't sure...

613
00:42:13,801 --> 00:42:16,921
but I had a bad feeling about him.

614
00:42:17,081 --> 00:42:19,761
So I ditched everything
and went out.

615
00:42:19,921 --> 00:42:22,561
What sort of feeling ?

616
00:42:22,721 --> 00:42:25,241
Well, a hunch.

617
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:28,481
This guy was in a very clean car,

618
00:42:29,521 --> 00:42:32,881
it even had a "Baby on Board" sticker.

619
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:36,321
But he was strange, restless,

620
00:42:36,481 --> 00:42:37,921
he parked poorly.

621
00:42:38,161 --> 00:42:42,641
He seemed out of place...
out of place.

622
00:42:42,961 --> 00:42:45,881
- Carry on.
- I kept walking toward the girl

623
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:48,521
while he turned on his car,
peeling away.

624
00:42:48,881 --> 00:42:49,921
- Toward the girl ?
- Yes.

625
00:42:50,081 --> 00:42:53,081
So I started running like crazy
and caught up with her...

626
00:42:53,241 --> 00:42:55,281
I pushed her out of the street.

627
00:42:55,521 --> 00:42:58,001
The Golf almost hit me,

628
00:42:58,321 --> 00:42:59,441
then he raced off.

629
00:43:02,321 --> 00:43:05,201
- Someone wants to kill her ?
- So it seems.

630
00:43:06,921 --> 00:43:08,601
You knew ?

631
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:13,081
- Tell me !
- Yes, someone wants to kill her.

632
00:43:13,801 --> 00:43:16,361
And when my task is over ?

633
00:43:16,521 --> 00:43:19,401
What'll the girl do ?
I only have a week left.

634
00:43:20,001 --> 00:43:22,481
- You'll get what you want.
- And Matilde ?

635
00:43:23,161 --> 00:43:24,601
She'll carry on living.

636
00:43:25,121 --> 00:43:26,321
Wait.

637
00:43:26,681 --> 00:43:28,321
She'll carry on being in danger!

638
00:43:28,881 --> 00:43:30,801
We're all in danger out there.

639
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:51,681
I can't do it.

640
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:54,041
- Why ?
- It's complicated.

641
00:43:54,281 --> 00:43:57,401
Covering up a report is tricky,
a violent crime report is impossible.

642
00:43:58,841 --> 00:44:00,841
Is that the only problem ?

643
00:44:01,001 --> 00:44:03,121
My son's gone,
he might be in trouble.

644
00:44:03,281 --> 00:44:05,961
- Give me a hand.
- Why did he leave ?

645
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:12,121
At times I'd come home
from work tired,

646
00:44:14,441 --> 00:44:16,921
grouchy... intoxicated, we can say.

647
00:44:20,121 --> 00:44:23,321
Every fuck-up I did
spilled over onto my son.

648
00:44:24,641 --> 00:44:26,441
I want to rectify that.

649
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:30,081
Or is it too late ?

650
00:44:31,641 --> 00:44:33,641
It's not too late.

651
00:44:33,881 --> 00:44:35,201
I think.

652
00:44:46,881 --> 00:44:48,281
Hello.

653
00:44:49,841 --> 00:44:51,081
Hi.

654
00:44:51,361 --> 00:44:52,441
How was your day ?

655
00:44:53,841 --> 00:44:54,801
Fine, thanks.

656
00:44:56,401 --> 00:44:58,441
Got a second to talk ?

657
00:45:00,001 --> 00:45:01,281
To talk ?

658
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:06,161
People usually come to me
to ask for something.

659
00:45:06,321 --> 00:45:09,201
Well, I just want to talk.

660
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:11,681
Is it that odd ?

661
00:45:12,921 --> 00:45:14,321
No.

662
00:45:14,561 --> 00:45:16,601
People usually ask me
for complicated things.

663
00:45:16,761 --> 00:45:19,561
People, people, people...

664
00:45:20,441 --> 00:45:22,921
I'm not like other people.

665
00:45:27,761 --> 00:45:28,841
Well ?

666
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:32,521
Hello, my name is Angela.

667
00:45:34,081 --> 00:45:35,481
Hi, Angela.

668
00:45:37,161 --> 00:45:39,041
And your name ?

669
00:45:39,761 --> 00:45:42,001
It's not important.

670
00:45:42,761 --> 00:45:45,441
Usually men love
talking about themselves.

671
00:45:47,401 --> 00:45:48,961
I'm interested in others.

672
00:45:49,281 --> 00:45:51,081
What do you see in others ?

673
00:45:51,401 --> 00:45:52,801
Everything.

674
00:45:53,441 --> 00:45:55,601
Good or bad things ?

675
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:57,441
Things that are...

676
00:45:58,681 --> 00:46:00,081
unexpected.

677
00:46:13,241 --> 00:46:14,761
And ?

678
00:46:16,721 --> 00:46:17,961
I fucked up.

679
00:46:19,921 --> 00:46:21,921
I was right about that man.

680
00:46:22,081 --> 00:46:23,241
Who ?

681
00:46:24,641 --> 00:46:26,161
The barman.

682
00:46:27,081 --> 00:46:28,441
Tell me...

683
00:46:28,801 --> 00:46:32,001
The police must be after me,
someone must've seen my plates.

684
00:46:32,161 --> 00:46:35,281
Calm down and tell me what happened.

685
00:46:38,081 --> 00:46:41,201
I was watching her
from inside my car.

686
00:46:42,081 --> 00:46:44,001
My throat was dry, my tummy ached,

687
00:46:45,321 --> 00:46:47,281
I was about to leave but thought:

688
00:46:47,441 --> 00:46:52,481
"lfl don't do it, every time I go home
my son's room will be empty !"

689
00:46:52,681 --> 00:46:56,161
And so I stepped on the gas
and drove toward her.

690
00:46:59,921 --> 00:47:01,681
And she looked at me.

691
00:47:05,121 --> 00:47:08,841
The girl turned around
and looked straight at me.

692
00:47:12,881 --> 00:47:15,081
That guy just showed up
and saved her,

693
00:47:15,241 --> 00:47:18,201
I almost hit her,
then I raced off.

694
00:47:20,081 --> 00:47:22,761
I left the car in a mall parking lot

695
00:47:22,921 --> 00:47:24,921
and walked home.

696
00:47:26,601 --> 00:47:29,201
I told my wife
the car had been stolen.

697
00:47:32,681 --> 00:47:35,561
This is not the kind of father
I want to be.

698
00:47:54,881 --> 00:47:57,401
- Why'd you go to church ?
- To think...

699
00:47:58,081 --> 00:47:59,641
and be alone.

700
00:47:59,801 --> 00:48:03,561
She approached me,
she was very kind and open.

701
00:48:04,761 --> 00:48:09,321
And I started thinking
that with a church-going girl

702
00:48:10,801 --> 00:48:13,281
it'd be easier to get her to trust me.

703
00:48:14,761 --> 00:48:16,921
That's horrible, isn't it?

704
00:48:19,161 --> 00:48:21,681
She's very thin which is crucial.

705
00:48:21,841 --> 00:48:23,521
- Why ?
- She can't defend herself.

706
00:48:26,001 --> 00:48:28,121
How do you know she's thin ?

707
00:48:29,241 --> 00:48:30,801
I touched her face, shoulders,

708
00:48:31,161 --> 00:48:32,561
she's tiny.

709
00:48:32,841 --> 00:48:34,401
She let you touch her ?

710
00:48:34,561 --> 00:48:38,081
She's shy, but I explained
that's how I "see" people

711
00:48:38,641 --> 00:48:40,401
so she let me do it.

712
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:45,001
Last night we met up
at a diner by my house.

713
00:48:45,801 --> 00:48:46,921
Was she relaxed ?

714
00:48:47,601 --> 00:48:50,761
I've been out with sighted girls
before, I know the drill:

715
00:48:50,921 --> 00:48:52,681
they trust me.

716
00:48:53,961 --> 00:48:56,321
Everyone trusts a blind guy.

717
00:48:57,841 --> 00:49:00,641
A blind guy can't hurt you, damn it.

718
00:49:01,041 --> 00:49:03,641
- Next date ?
- Tomorrow at the same diner.

719
00:49:05,521 --> 00:49:07,401
I just want to talk to her,

720
00:49:07,601 --> 00:49:10,041
I won't invite her over
or she might say no.

721
00:49:12,441 --> 00:49:14,241
How'll you rape her ?

722
00:49:17,641 --> 00:49:19,881
I don't want to rape anyone.

723
00:49:23,161 --> 00:49:24,641
Back out.

724
00:49:26,361 --> 00:49:27,801
You can.

725
00:49:48,441 --> 00:49:50,961
I did it, I did it.

726
00:49:51,401 --> 00:49:52,881
I placed the bomb in the diner.

727
00:49:53,201 --> 00:49:55,961
- Mrs. Marcella.
- Now my husband will get well ?

728
00:49:56,441 --> 00:49:58,401
The Alzheimer's is gone now ?

729
00:49:58,561 --> 00:50:02,361
So he can come home to me, right?

730
00:50:02,761 --> 00:50:04,961
- You didn't set off the bomb.
- I did.

731
00:50:05,121 --> 00:50:06,361
- No.
- I did.

732
00:50:08,321 --> 00:50:10,961
Or you wouldn't be here
talking about Alzheimer's.

733
00:50:13,721 --> 00:50:14,681
I'm sorry.

734
00:50:15,841 --> 00:50:17,241
You can back out if you want.

735
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:19,321
Yes...

736
00:50:20,841 --> 00:50:22,041
Yes...

737
00:50:22,841 --> 00:50:24,801
I'll back out.

738
00:50:29,281 --> 00:50:30,721
Take care.

739
00:50:38,321 --> 00:50:40,041
How'd you do it?

740
00:50:40,361 --> 00:50:42,601
I didn't do it, you did.

741
00:50:42,761 --> 00:50:45,801
Sure, I helped some old ladies
cross the street,

742
00:50:45,961 --> 00:50:47,681
how the fuck did you do it?

743
00:50:47,841 --> 00:50:49,481
You carried out your task

744
00:50:49,641 --> 00:50:51,681
and got what you requested.

745
00:50:52,201 --> 00:50:54,041
I don't believe it, you planned it.

746
00:50:54,481 --> 00:50:56,121
Don't believe it.

747
00:50:56,641 --> 00:50:58,721
I have work to do now...

748
00:50:58,881 --> 00:51:00,481
Fine, I believe you.

749
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:03,681
And I have a request too.
Can we make a deal?

750
00:51:03,841 --> 00:51:06,801
- What do you want?
- I want my dad to leave me alone.

751
00:51:06,961 --> 00:51:10,161
- Meaning ?
- His dad's an asshole.

752
00:51:10,321 --> 00:51:13,561
A shithead who ruined
my life and my mom's

753
00:51:13,721 --> 00:51:16,361
and I won't forgive him
but he keeps hounding me !

754
00:51:16,521 --> 00:51:19,081
He uses his cop tricks to track me.

755
00:51:19,521 --> 00:51:22,161
I want him out of my life for good.

756
00:51:22,321 --> 00:51:23,401
For good.

757
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:27,561
- Are you sure ?
- Yes.

758
00:51:29,761 --> 00:51:31,561
It's doable.

759
00:51:40,961 --> 00:51:42,401
Help Martina.

760
00:51:45,401 --> 00:51:47,721
Help Martina steal 100,000.05 euros

761
00:51:48,281 --> 00:51:50,121
and you'll both get what you want.

762
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,041
That's it ?

763
00:52:02,081 --> 00:52:04,481
- He slapped me.
- Why?

764
00:52:05,641 --> 00:52:09,121
I went to his place again
and was more aggressive this time.

765
00:52:09,441 --> 00:52:10,561
And he slapped you ?

766
00:52:10,841 --> 00:52:12,321
Ijumped on him.

767
00:52:14,761 --> 00:52:16,041
I lost control,

768
00:52:17,721 --> 00:52:20,641
I was exhilarated,
getting naked and kissing him.

769
00:52:21,881 --> 00:52:24,081
And then he slapped me.

770
00:52:24,601 --> 00:52:28,521
- What did you do ?
- Slapped him back, I was livid.

771
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:31,121
Then I ran off.

772
00:52:31,921 --> 00:52:33,401
Why were you livid ?

773
00:52:34,881 --> 00:52:37,401
Because I wish my husband
were like that.

774
00:52:38,681 --> 00:52:40,761
Amanda came back to the garage

775
00:52:40,921 --> 00:52:42,961
and chatted with me for 5 minutes.

776
00:52:44,001 --> 00:52:45,881
She gave me a new picture and said:

777
00:52:46,761 --> 00:52:49,521
"Get rid of the others,
I'm the jealous type".

778
00:52:50,441 --> 00:52:51,841
Imagine that!

779
00:52:52,641 --> 00:52:54,201
Jealous of me...

780
00:52:54,881 --> 00:52:58,401
She wrote her phone number
on the back of the picture.

781
00:52:58,761 --> 00:53:00,641
Holy shit...

782
00:53:01,161 --> 00:53:03,161
I guess you are the real deal.

783
00:53:05,841 --> 00:53:08,921
You're reaching your goal,
you have 3 days left.

784
00:53:09,201 --> 00:53:11,721
Yes, but some guy
wants to kill that kid.

785
00:53:11,881 --> 00:53:14,161
I can'tjust abandon her.

786
00:53:14,321 --> 00:53:16,401
Tell her parents, call the cops.

787
00:53:16,681 --> 00:53:18,481
And say what?

788
00:53:19,921 --> 00:53:23,121
They'd never believe me,
you know that. No...

789
00:53:25,121 --> 00:53:28,281
I have to handle it myself.
I need to get a gun.

790
00:53:28,961 --> 00:53:30,961
I'll protect her really, really well.

791
00:53:48,881 --> 00:53:50,321
There's an issue.

792
00:53:51,921 --> 00:53:53,521
The fucking gun.

793
00:53:54,081 --> 00:53:55,561
Huh ?

794
00:53:55,921 --> 00:53:58,201
My service gun was stolen.

795
00:54:00,521 --> 00:54:03,201
Quit smirking or I'll punch you.

796
00:54:03,361 --> 00:54:05,401
I should've put it in the safe

797
00:54:05,561 --> 00:54:08,161
but I left it on the nightstand
like a dumbass.

798
00:54:08,361 --> 00:54:10,201
Now I'm in deep shit.

799
00:54:14,161 --> 00:54:15,761
You had something to do with this ?

800
00:54:16,481 --> 00:54:18,041
Why do you say that ?

801
00:54:19,281 --> 00:54:21,521
Because I'm used
to asking myself questions.

802
00:54:22,921 --> 00:54:25,521
I still don't know
who the fuck you are.

803
00:54:39,361 --> 00:54:40,681
Want some ?

804
00:54:45,761 --> 00:54:47,001
Cheers.

805
00:54:55,081 --> 00:54:56,561
Do you have a woman ?

806
00:55:01,401 --> 00:55:02,761
All right...

807
00:55:03,041 --> 00:55:04,801
Here's my reading:

808
00:55:05,281 --> 00:55:08,521
You're married, separated

809
00:55:08,841 --> 00:55:11,361
for 3-4 years with no kids.

810
00:55:12,441 --> 00:55:14,721
You got burned and haven't healed.

811
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:25,681
Since you won't talk,
let's play a game.

812
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:30,241
A game I played as a kid:
the silence game.

813
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:33,241
Know it?

814
00:55:34,241 --> 00:55:35,761
Whoever laughs first loses.

815
00:56:27,361 --> 00:56:30,321
- You're getting serious.
- We stole it from his dad.

816
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:33,081
<i>_</i> "We" ?
- I played lookout.

817
00:56:33,241 --> 00:56:35,641
He snuck in the window.
It was cool !

818
00:56:37,201 --> 00:56:40,441
- His dad will get in trouble.
- So what?!

819
00:56:40,601 --> 00:56:42,681
We're on for tomorrow.

820
00:56:42,841 --> 00:56:46,841
- My friend will be away.
- Martina managed to copy the house keys.

821
00:56:47,361 --> 00:56:48,481
It'll be a cinch.

822
00:56:48,641 --> 00:56:50,841
We'll have the money tomorrow.

823
00:56:53,441 --> 00:56:55,801
And I'll never see my dad again.

824
00:56:55,961 --> 00:56:57,121
Right ?

825
00:56:58,441 --> 00:56:59,481
Right.

826
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:03,961
And I'll become prettier.

827
00:57:17,281 --> 00:57:20,321
She was kidnapped,
someone kidnapped the girl.

828
00:57:21,241 --> 00:57:23,241
What? Kidnapped ?

829
00:57:23,401 --> 00:57:25,841
She just disappeared like that !

830
00:57:32,041 --> 00:57:34,121
Do you have something
to do with this ?

831
00:57:35,041 --> 00:57:36,761
- No.
- No?

832
00:57:37,281 --> 00:57:39,801
- I think you do.
- I don't.

833
00:57:39,961 --> 00:57:42,041
You asked me to kill a little girl

834
00:57:42,201 --> 00:57:45,801
and while I'm trying,
some guy protects her

835
00:57:46,001 --> 00:57:48,441
and now she disappears...
Odd, isn't it ?

836
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:49,921
You're involved.

837
00:57:50,441 --> 00:57:52,361
Would that make a difference '2

838
00:57:52,881 --> 00:57:53,841
Yes.

839
00:57:54,681 --> 00:57:56,961
How do you feel right now ?

840
00:57:58,521 --> 00:58:00,481
Forget your fucked up games.

841
00:58:00,641 --> 00:58:04,281
You're playing with my son's life,
do not mess with me.

842
00:58:10,481 --> 00:58:12,481
Someone's protecting that girl.

843
00:58:14,121 --> 00:58:15,521
Why <i>'2</i>

844
00:58:15,961 --> 00:58:18,561
A man came to me with a request,

845
00:58:18,721 --> 00:58:22,521
I opened the notebook and
it said he had to protect that girl.

846
00:58:22,841 --> 00:58:25,601
- Why that girl ?
- That's what it said.

847
00:58:26,641 --> 00:58:27,801
Really ?

848
00:58:28,321 --> 00:58:30,961
- That's what the notebook said ?
- Yes.

849
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:32,801
Let's see...

850
00:58:33,201 --> 00:58:34,601
Let go.

851
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,121
- Liar.
- Let go.

852
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:46,521
Why pit him against me ?

853
00:58:46,841 --> 00:58:48,761
I didn't, he doesn't know about you.

854
00:58:49,481 --> 00:58:52,201
You gave me a task
that's impossible to carry out.

855
00:58:52,561 --> 00:58:54,961
I don't assign impossible tasks.

856
00:58:55,121 --> 00:58:57,481
- They might be complicated...
- I'm calling the cops.

857
00:58:57,961 --> 00:58:59,401
No, you won't.

858
00:59:07,441 --> 00:59:08,721
No, I won't.

859
00:59:30,281 --> 00:59:32,441
- You're early.
- It worked.

860
00:59:33,961 --> 00:59:35,321
Details.

861
00:59:35,761 --> 00:59:38,521
I went to apologize
to Andrea yesterday for the slap.

862
00:59:38,921 --> 00:59:42,281
After 5 minutes of chitchat,
I asked to use the bathroom.

863
00:59:42,601 --> 00:59:45,001
Instead I snuck into their bedroom,

864
00:59:45,161 --> 00:59:48,081
put my panties under the bed
and some hairs on the pillow.

865
00:59:48,561 --> 00:59:50,841
I even sprayed some perfume...

866
00:59:51,441 --> 00:59:53,001
That's all it took.

867
00:59:54,481 --> 00:59:55,481
Meaning ?

868
00:59:55,841 --> 00:59:58,321
While eating dinner with my husband,
Andrea called,

869
00:59:58,481 --> 01:00:00,281
they talked for an hour.

870
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:03,401
He came back to the table, drained...

871
01:00:03,561 --> 01:00:07,041
Andrea's wife threw him out
because she thinks he's cheating.

872
01:00:08,921 --> 01:00:10,641
What did you say ?

873
01:00:11,161 --> 01:00:12,641
That it's true.

874
01:00:13,761 --> 01:00:15,841
"How do you know ?", he asked.

875
01:00:16,721 --> 01:00:17,761
I said:

876
01:00:18,241 --> 01:00:20,881
"Because he cheated on her with me."

877
01:00:21,841 --> 01:00:24,721
Why'd you say that ? It's not true.

878
01:00:26,521 --> 01:00:29,081
I wanted to make him suffer.

879
01:00:29,241 --> 01:00:30,921
Did you enjoy it ?

880
01:00:31,401 --> 01:00:33,001
Yes, it was amazing.

881
01:00:33,601 --> 01:00:36,281
Instead of getting mad he cried.

882
01:00:36,721 --> 01:00:40,441
He said it was his fault
for drifting away first,

883
01:00:40,601 --> 01:00:43,881
that he ruined everything,
that he was devastated.

884
01:00:46,921 --> 01:00:49,881
Then we made love
like we hadn't in ages.

885
01:00:54,441 --> 01:00:56,921
Good, you got what you wanted.

886
01:00:59,001 --> 01:01:01,081
We can say goodbye now.

887
01:01:54,081 --> 01:01:56,921
We meet every night in that diner.

888
01:01:57,241 --> 01:01:58,321
Why there ?

889
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:01,601
He says that place smells good

890
01:02:01,841 --> 01:02:03,521
and so do I.

891
01:02:06,161 --> 01:02:07,601
That's a good start.

892
01:02:07,761 --> 01:02:11,281
Last night we were out till late,
very late.

893
01:02:12,401 --> 01:02:14,001
Or very early.

894
01:02:16,361 --> 01:02:17,841
- Did you...?
- No.

895
01:02:19,441 --> 01:02:21,281
We just talked.

896
01:02:22,281 --> 01:02:23,841
I don't want to rush.

897
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:26,521
Plus, he's old-fashioned,
shy, polite...

898
01:02:31,121 --> 01:02:33,161
I want him to make the first move.

899
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:40,281
Are you feeling God again ?

900
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:42,201
No.

901
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:45,321
- I have to get pregnant first.
- Yes.

902
01:02:45,481 --> 01:02:48,121
- That was our deal, right?
- Yes...

903
01:02:48,761 --> 01:02:50,641
You just seem so happy.

904
01:02:53,121 --> 01:02:56,241
- Could I feel God again without...?
- Sure.

905
01:02:57,601 --> 01:03:00,441
There are many solutions
to the same problem.

906
01:03:01,561 --> 01:03:03,521
I just offer one.

907
01:03:05,201 --> 01:03:07,481
Do you believe in God ?

908
01:03:09,561 --> 01:03:11,081
I believe in details.

909
01:03:22,641 --> 01:03:24,481
I kidnapped the girl.

910
01:03:24,641 --> 01:03:26,081
I saw.

911
01:03:26,641 --> 01:03:28,361
- Why ?
- To protect her.

912
01:03:28,521 --> 01:03:29,841
You didn't have to.

913
01:03:30,001 --> 01:03:31,481
You got what you wanted.

914
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,801
You completed your task,
Amanda is yours.

915
01:03:35,241 --> 01:03:37,441
I can't walk away, she's just a kid.

916
01:03:37,601 --> 01:03:39,801
Do you realize what could happen ?

917
01:03:40,201 --> 01:03:42,401
Everyone's looking for her.

918
01:03:43,201 --> 01:03:44,561
I know,

919
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:47,401
I've got it all organized.

920
01:03:47,681 --> 01:03:50,041
- How ?
- I won't tell you where she is.

921
01:03:50,361 --> 01:03:52,481
- Is she alone now ?
- Yes.

922
01:03:53,481 --> 01:03:55,401
She's safely locked away.

923
01:03:56,321 --> 01:03:58,241
Did she recognize you ?

924
01:03:58,561 --> 01:03:59,761
No.

925
01:04:00,281 --> 01:04:02,601
I always wear a mask.

926
01:04:04,641 --> 01:04:06,161
Smart, right ?

927
01:04:08,401 --> 01:04:09,921
Why'd you do it?

928
01:04:11,161 --> 01:04:13,321
I want to be a hero.

929
01:04:15,041 --> 01:04:16,521
A hero.

930
01:04:17,241 --> 01:04:18,761
So I can have everything

931
01:04:19,401 --> 01:04:22,521
without having to ask
people like you.

932
01:04:47,201 --> 01:04:48,641
I'm ready.

933
01:04:49,601 --> 01:04:50,841
I'll invite her over.

934
01:04:53,641 --> 01:04:55,001
And do what exactly ?

935
01:04:57,241 --> 01:04:58,601
I have a plan:

936
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:01,641
invite her over,
push her into the bathroom,

937
01:05:02,361 --> 01:05:04,161
it's small so it'll work better.

938
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:06,321
Why didn't you do this before ?

939
01:05:06,961 --> 01:05:08,401
I told you.

940
01:05:08,641 --> 01:05:11,681
I was afraid she'd say no
but now...

941
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:12,961
I'm sure she'll say yes.

942
01:05:13,121 --> 01:05:14,721
How can you be sure ?

943
01:05:15,561 --> 01:05:17,721
I think she likes me.

944
01:05:18,521 --> 01:05:20,401
Women usually run from me.

945
01:05:21,161 --> 01:05:22,601
After a while.

946
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:25,481
With a billion excuses...

947
01:05:26,281 --> 01:05:28,641
But the reason is always the same.

948
01:05:29,641 --> 01:05:32,681
Would you want a blind girlfriend
if you could see again ?

949
01:05:42,481 --> 01:05:44,721
You have no mercy.

950
01:05:50,801 --> 01:05:52,801
Neither do you all.

951
01:06:17,961 --> 01:06:19,321
What's wrong ?

952
01:06:21,441 --> 01:06:23,801
My son tried to pull off a robbery.

953
01:06:24,441 --> 01:06:27,761
- How do you know ?
- I saw the CCTV footage.

954
01:06:28,081 --> 01:06:30,841
Two of them with covered faces,
but I know it's him.

955
01:06:31,001 --> 01:06:32,881
He had my fucking gun.

956
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:37,121
- They caught him ?
- No, he got away.

957
01:06:37,681 --> 01:06:39,921
- I have to help him.
- Complete your task.

958
01:06:41,281 --> 01:06:42,881
There's no time !

959
01:06:44,121 --> 01:06:45,841
He's a loose cannon
and could end up dead.

960
01:06:46,001 --> 01:06:47,401
Could...

961
01:06:48,841 --> 01:06:52,241
- Complete your task.
- You're fucking useless.

962
01:06:52,601 --> 01:06:54,121
Useless to me.

963
01:07:02,841 --> 01:07:04,281
My husband spoke to me.

964
01:07:05,281 --> 01:07:06,521
He's better ?

965
01:07:06,681 --> 01:07:09,481
No, it wasn't him, it was a dream.

966
01:07:10,041 --> 01:07:12,121
He looked at me and said:

967
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:14,281
"Hold me, don't let me go.

968
01:07:14,521 --> 01:07:16,841
Don't let me go."

969
01:07:17,681 --> 01:07:19,721
He was sad, very sad.

970
01:07:20,401 --> 01:07:21,361
I'm sorry.

971
01:07:21,521 --> 01:07:22,961
So...

972
01:07:23,481 --> 01:07:25,721
I'll set off the bomb.

973
01:07:27,241 --> 01:07:28,721
I really will.

974
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:32,681
I thought you backed out?

975
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:35,721
Well, I changed my mind.
ls that allowed ?

976
01:07:35,881 --> 01:07:37,561
Can I save my husband ?

977
01:07:38,761 --> 01:07:39,721
Yes.

978
01:07:42,881 --> 01:07:46,881
Someone has to die in order
for us to get what we want.

979
01:07:47,561 --> 01:07:50,361
That's always been the case, right?

980
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:53,961
Yes, indeed.

981
01:08:02,881 --> 01:08:04,641
I was just at the hospital.

982
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:09,041
- And ?
- My son's doing better.

983
01:08:10,521 --> 01:08:14,081
I read him a story
and he didn't fall asleep till the end.

984
01:08:14,721 --> 01:08:19,321
And when I picked him up
he already seemed heavier.

985
01:08:22,561 --> 01:08:24,561
Because I almost found the girl...

986
01:08:26,961 --> 01:08:28,601
Details ?

987
01:08:28,841 --> 01:08:30,281
I know the kidnapper.

988
01:08:31,201 --> 01:08:33,961
- Who is it ?
- The guy who saved her.

989
01:08:34,121 --> 01:08:35,961
The barman.

990
01:08:37,721 --> 01:08:40,681
- What'd you do ?
- I followed him home.

991
01:08:41,161 --> 01:08:44,121
When he went out,
I snuck into his garage.

992
01:08:44,281 --> 01:08:47,121
I rummaged through the trash,

993
01:08:47,281 --> 01:08:50,241
there was a receipt from a toy store.

994
01:08:50,761 --> 01:08:54,761
The date on it was the same date
the girl was kidnapped.

995
01:08:54,921 --> 01:08:56,321
- Is it him ?
- Could be.

996
01:08:56,481 --> 01:08:58,441
It's him.

997
01:08:59,161 --> 01:09:00,721
You sent him to protect her.

998
01:09:03,041 --> 01:09:04,321
You lied.

999
01:09:05,121 --> 01:09:07,081
You do assign impossible tasks !

1000
01:09:07,521 --> 01:09:09,681
For one of us, this task is impossible.

1001
01:09:09,841 --> 01:09:11,841
It wasn't supposed to be.

1002
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:15,601
He was supposed to stop
protecting her a week ago.

1003
01:09:18,201 --> 01:09:22,281
Since you caused this mess,
tell me where she is.

1004
01:09:22,721 --> 01:09:25,121
- I don't know.
- You lied, you should help me.

1005
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:27,921
He's cautious and wouldn't tell me.

1006
01:09:30,601 --> 01:09:32,721
How'd it feel to walk into his home ?

1007
01:09:33,881 --> 01:09:35,121
I felt...

1008
01:09:38,561 --> 01:09:40,001
strong.

1009
01:09:40,561 --> 01:09:41,881
Strong ?

1010
01:09:42,041 --> 01:09:45,961
I struggled to reach a goal,
I made a choice.

1011
01:09:46,841 --> 01:09:49,721
In my life, I've always
done things without intention:

1012
01:09:49,921 --> 01:09:52,041
accounting, bank job, family.

1013
01:09:52,201 --> 01:09:54,121
It was always the "right" thing to do.

1014
01:09:54,281 --> 01:09:58,041
But I never actually chose something
with intention.

1015
01:09:58,801 --> 01:10:01,201
How does it feel to choose ?

1016
01:10:04,201 --> 01:10:05,761
Fucking amazing.

1017
01:10:09,161 --> 01:10:10,361
I did it.

1018
01:10:13,241 --> 01:10:15,601
I invited her over tomorrow night.

1019
01:10:16,521 --> 01:10:17,561
She agreed ?

1020
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:21,201
Yes, and was happy.

1021
01:10:22,441 --> 01:10:24,241
She likes being with me.

1022
01:10:25,161 --> 01:10:28,081
Funny thing is,
I like being with her too,

1023
01:10:28,241 --> 01:10:30,681
when I'm not thinking about my task.

1024
01:10:31,681 --> 01:10:33,321
I want to fall in love again.

1025
01:10:36,761 --> 01:10:39,241
I don't want to be afraid
a woman will tire of me

1026
01:10:39,761 --> 01:10:42,241
or is just with me out of pity.

1027
01:10:44,521 --> 01:10:46,481
I want to see again...

1028
01:10:47,921 --> 01:10:49,361
so I'll do it.

1029
01:10:49,521 --> 01:10:51,041
Tomorrow night.

1030
01:10:53,881 --> 01:10:56,281
- What do you think of her ?
- It won't be her.

1031
01:10:57,241 --> 01:10:58,601
Meaning ?

1032
01:10:58,801 --> 01:11:00,481
She won't be the woman I love,

1033
01:11:00,921 --> 01:11:02,681
it'll be the next one.

1034
01:11:13,521 --> 01:11:15,361
I no longer want him.

1035
01:11:16,521 --> 01:11:18,921
- I don't understand.
- I no longer want my husband.

1036
01:11:19,481 --> 01:11:21,401
What do you mean ?

1037
01:11:21,561 --> 01:11:23,841
You wrecked a couple for him.

1038
01:11:24,001 --> 01:11:24,921
I know.

1039
01:11:27,081 --> 01:11:28,201
Why the change ?

1040
01:11:29,121 --> 01:11:30,361
Because I cheated.

1041
01:11:31,361 --> 01:11:34,441
His eyes are full of love now
but they don't warm me.

1042
01:11:35,001 --> 01:11:37,201
And he'll go back to who he was...

1043
01:11:37,681 --> 01:11:41,121
he'll get bored, cheat on me,
people don't change.

1044
01:11:41,281 --> 01:11:43,641
If you think that,
why'd you come to me ?

1045
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:45,081
I realized it after.

1046
01:11:45,721 --> 01:11:47,801
I realized it thanks to Andrea,

1047
01:11:47,961 --> 01:11:50,281
his eyes, his love for his wife.

1048
01:11:50,441 --> 01:11:54,001
He and my husband
are cut from a different cloth,

1049
01:11:54,161 --> 01:11:56,921
and it's too deep-rooted
to play around with.

1050
01:11:57,561 --> 01:11:59,121
I no longer want him.

1051
01:12:02,761 --> 01:12:04,681
He's becoming violent.

1052
01:12:05,081 --> 01:12:06,721
Violent ?

1053
01:12:16,121 --> 01:12:18,321
He went nuts and hit me.

1054
01:12:18,601 --> 01:12:21,081
He thinks I'm cheating on him
with the neighbor.

1055
01:12:22,281 --> 01:12:24,001
He says he can't live without me.

1056
01:12:25,801 --> 01:12:27,441
But this isn't living.

1057
01:12:43,721 --> 01:12:45,561
What a disaster...

1058
01:12:45,721 --> 01:12:48,081
- Where's Martina ?
- She's wounded.

1059
01:12:48,321 --> 01:12:50,721
- Nothing serious.
- What happened ?

1060
01:12:50,881 --> 01:12:52,481
A disaster !

1061
01:12:54,321 --> 01:12:55,841
The dog started barking,

1062
01:12:56,001 --> 01:12:58,761
the servants called the guard
and he caught us.

1063
01:12:59,601 --> 01:13:00,761
We tried to run

1064
01:13:00,921 --> 01:13:03,161
but he shot and hit Martina
in the arm.

1065
01:13:08,001 --> 01:13:10,161
Relax, they're not here for you.

1066
01:13:11,281 --> 01:13:13,281
- How do you know ?
- I know.

1067
01:13:15,841 --> 01:13:17,641
Carry on, don't look.

1068
01:13:17,881 --> 01:13:19,201
Christ.

1069
01:13:20,641 --> 01:13:22,081
Go on.

1070
01:13:24,841 --> 01:13:27,521
I want Martina
to back out of her deal.

1071
01:13:29,561 --> 01:13:32,681
- Talk to her.
- She won't listen to me.

1072
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:35,601
She wants to be prettier,
for me.

1073
01:13:35,921 --> 01:13:38,041
I told her it doesn't matter to me,

1074
01:13:38,361 --> 01:13:40,801
that she's gorgeous,
but she won't listen.

1075
01:13:40,961 --> 01:13:43,121
She's convinced I'll dump her.

1076
01:13:44,041 --> 01:13:45,921
She's planning another robbery.

1077
01:13:47,441 --> 01:13:49,121
Call off the deal.

1078
01:13:49,281 --> 01:13:51,641
- It's not up to me.
- It fucking is.

1079
01:13:51,801 --> 01:13:53,161
Lower your voice.

1080
01:13:54,001 --> 01:13:55,441
Stop her, you can.

1081
01:13:55,601 --> 01:13:56,921
I can't.

1082
01:13:59,281 --> 01:14:01,041
Please.

1083
01:14:02,801 --> 01:14:04,761
Please, I don't want to lose her.

1084
01:14:06,001 --> 01:14:08,241
- Is that what you really want?
- Yes.

1085
01:14:13,361 --> 01:14:15,041
Let's make a deal...

1086
01:14:16,361 --> 01:14:17,681
Another ?

1087
01:14:17,841 --> 01:14:19,561
The one about my dad ?

1088
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:21,801
Annulled, one deal at a time.

1089
01:14:24,561 --> 01:14:25,761
Okay.

1090
01:14:30,601 --> 01:14:32,401
Go see your dad.

1091
01:14:33,881 --> 01:14:34,801
What ?

1092
01:14:35,401 --> 01:14:36,641
Tell him you love him.

1093
01:14:37,081 --> 01:14:40,241
You are totally insane,
I will never do anything like that.

1094
01:14:40,401 --> 01:14:42,241
Then don't.

1095
01:14:43,881 --> 01:14:46,681
Give me another task,
I'll do anything.

1096
01:14:46,841 --> 01:14:48,601
It's this or nothing.

1097
01:14:52,801 --> 01:14:54,521
Okay.

1098
01:14:56,321 --> 01:14:58,361
Fine, I'll d0 it.

1099
01:15:41,361 --> 01:15:42,921
Angela.

1100
01:15:44,121 --> 01:15:46,041
Why are you so lonely ?

1101
01:15:49,361 --> 01:15:51,081
Why are you '2

1102
01:15:53,441 --> 01:15:55,241
I have my reasons.

1103
01:15:55,401 --> 01:15:58,081
I assume they're different
than other people's reasons ?

1104
01:16:00,081 --> 01:16:01,441
Correct.

1105
01:16:04,401 --> 01:16:05,961
Your turn.

1106
01:16:08,521 --> 01:16:11,241
I've been waiting for love forever.

1107
01:16:11,721 --> 01:16:13,841
You don't often tell people that.

1108
01:16:16,681 --> 01:16:18,721
I have no one to tell.

1109
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:20,681
Since when ?

1110
01:16:29,561 --> 01:16:31,321
Yesterday my life was filled with rain

1111
01:16:31,481 --> 01:16:34,561
then you smiled at me
and eased the pain.

1112
01:16:37,041 --> 01:16:39,161
That's what the song says.

1113
01:16:39,641 --> 01:16:41,201
Can I turn it up?

1114
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:43,801
Go ahead.

1115
01:17:22,401 --> 01:17:23,801
You look tired.

1116
01:17:24,441 --> 01:17:25,481
I didn't sleep.

1117
01:17:26,881 --> 01:17:29,361
- How's the girl?
- She's still there.

1118
01:17:29,721 --> 01:17:32,081
I can't stay for long.

1119
01:17:32,281 --> 01:17:33,761
- Problems ?
- Problems ?

1120
01:17:34,601 --> 01:17:36,801
It's a fucking disaster.

1121
01:17:38,881 --> 01:17:41,401
Yesterday I went by my house

1122
01:17:41,561 --> 01:17:43,721
and the girl's predator was there.

1123
01:17:43,881 --> 01:17:45,681
He was outside of my garage.

1124
01:17:46,361 --> 01:17:50,081
I hid until he gave up and left.

1125
01:17:51,481 --> 01:17:52,961
So I followed him.

1126
01:17:54,321 --> 01:17:56,121
- You did ?
- Yes.

1127
01:17:56,601 --> 01:18:00,321
Now I know where
that bastard pedophile lives.

1128
01:18:02,081 --> 01:18:03,921
I will kill him.

1129
01:18:06,761 --> 01:18:08,681
- Kill him '2
- Of course.

1130
01:18:08,841 --> 01:18:11,121
Or he'll kill the girl.

1131
01:18:13,361 --> 01:18:15,041
Unless...

1132
01:18:15,841 --> 01:18:17,321
Unless ?

1133
01:18:17,481 --> 01:18:19,881
Unless we make a new deal.

1134
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:28,041
What do you want?

1135
01:18:28,641 --> 01:18:31,081
Save the girl.

1136
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:34,681
No can do,

1137
01:18:34,841 --> 01:18:37,041
I don't assign impossible tasks.

1138
01:18:37,201 --> 01:18:38,721
Impossible ?

1139
01:18:42,601 --> 01:18:46,921
If you're able to save her
then he's not able to kill her.

1140
01:18:48,161 --> 01:18:48,921
What ?

1141
01:18:51,641 --> 01:18:54,361
So you assigned him to kill her ?

1142
01:18:55,841 --> 01:18:58,481
What sort of bastard are you ?

1143
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:02,481
So tell me, whose side are you on ?

1144
01:19:09,121 --> 01:19:10,521
This side.

1145
01:19:13,561 --> 01:19:15,001
So I have no choice.

1146
01:19:15,521 --> 01:19:17,481
You have plenty of other choices.

1147
01:19:17,801 --> 01:19:21,281
Yes, but this is the choice I've made.

1148
01:19:22,641 --> 01:19:27,721
I will kill the guy
you assigned to kill the girl.

1149
01:19:29,641 --> 01:19:32,321
I win, you lose.

1150
01:19:45,801 --> 01:19:47,961
Why didn't it happen ?

1151
01:19:48,721 --> 01:19:50,481
You're sure you did it?

1152
01:19:51,201 --> 01:19:52,961
Of course.

1153
01:19:53,161 --> 01:19:56,201
- What exactly did you do ?
- What I had to !

1154
01:19:57,001 --> 01:19:58,921
I locked her in the bathroom,

1155
01:19:59,081 --> 01:20:01,401
threw her on the ground and raped her.

1156
01:20:01,561 --> 01:20:05,841
She cried, screamed, begged me
to stop but I didn't.

1157
01:20:09,321 --> 01:20:11,041
That's not what happened.

1158
01:20:11,681 --> 01:20:13,041
- It is.
- You didn't rape her.

1159
01:20:13,201 --> 01:20:15,401
I'm telling you I did !

1160
01:20:22,281 --> 01:20:24,841
If you had,
you'd be looking me in the eye.

1161
01:20:29,961 --> 01:20:31,961
Give me another chance.

1162
01:20:33,321 --> 01:20:35,241
This was your chance.

1163
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:39,081
Please.

1164
01:20:43,121 --> 01:20:44,881
I want to see.

1165
01:20:49,121 --> 01:20:50,641
It's not up to me.

1166
01:21:10,121 --> 01:21:11,801
What happened ?

1167
01:21:11,961 --> 01:21:14,121
The man who kidnapped the girl

1168
01:21:14,481 --> 01:21:16,041
tried to kill me.

1169
01:21:17,041 --> 01:21:19,161
- When ?
- Last night.

1170
01:21:19,481 --> 01:21:20,761
He came into my home...

1171
01:21:21,041 --> 01:21:22,201
And what happened ?

1172
01:21:22,361 --> 01:21:23,441
I stabbed him.

1173
01:21:27,681 --> 01:21:29,241
We need to talk.

1174
01:21:29,401 --> 01:21:31,041
- I'm busy.
- It's urgent.

1175
01:21:31,321 --> 01:21:33,321
- Wait.
- I said it's urgent.

1176
01:21:33,481 --> 01:21:35,281
I said wait.

1177
01:21:40,721 --> 01:21:42,681
What do you mean you stabbed him '2

1178
01:21:43,041 --> 01:21:44,601
Tell me.

1179
01:21:45,681 --> 01:21:47,241
He had a knife.

1180
01:21:47,401 --> 01:21:50,041
He pounced on me and we scuffled.

1181
01:21:50,881 --> 01:21:54,601
Then I managed to pry the knife
from his hands and...

1182
01:21:54,761 --> 01:21:56,801
I stabbed him in the stomach.

1183
01:21:56,961 --> 01:22:00,361
He passed out, my wife woke up,
and we called 911.

1184
01:22:00,521 --> 01:22:04,321
But first I went through his pockets
and found keys.

1185
01:22:04,481 --> 01:22:07,761
In his wallet there was
a real estate agency's business card.

1186
01:22:08,321 --> 01:22:10,441
- I called.
- And ?

1187
01:22:10,841 --> 01:22:12,801
I know where the girl is.

1188
01:22:15,961 --> 01:22:17,721
What'll you do now ?

1189
01:22:19,161 --> 01:22:21,001
What needs to be done.

1190
01:22:34,361 --> 01:22:35,841
Martina's gone mad.

1191
01:22:36,001 --> 01:22:38,961
She stole my gun
to go rob a store.

1192
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:42,401
She was supposed to back out.
That was our deal.

1193
01:22:42,761 --> 01:22:44,561
You didn't complete your task.

1194
01:22:44,721 --> 01:22:46,881
Of course I did,
and it was fucking hard!

1195
01:22:48,121 --> 01:22:49,641
- Details.
- Details...

1196
01:22:50,361 --> 01:22:54,481
I met with my dad
and told him I love him, a lot.

1197
01:22:54,641 --> 01:22:57,561
You can't just go there,
say you love him, and leave.

1198
01:22:58,481 --> 01:22:59,961
- No?
- No.

1199
01:23:01,241 --> 01:23:03,801
- You have to feel it.
- No, that's not what you said.

1200
01:23:04,121 --> 01:23:06,161
It goes without saying.

1201
01:23:07,201 --> 01:23:08,961
How the fuck will I do that ?

1202
01:23:10,081 --> 01:23:11,641
I don't love him.

1203
01:23:12,361 --> 01:23:14,481
Find a way to love him.

1204
01:23:20,481 --> 01:23:24,521
Did your dad beat you every night
after finishing off a bottle ?

1205
01:23:30,841 --> 01:23:32,681
Then you can't understand.

1206
01:23:35,081 --> 01:23:38,481
Of all the things he could've asked me,
guess what he wanted ?

1207
01:23:43,321 --> 01:23:45,321
My father came to see you ?

1208
01:23:46,401 --> 01:23:47,721
Guess.

1209
01:23:50,041 --> 01:23:52,921
No, I don't give a shit,
I don't want to know.

1210
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:02,241
Fulvio and I made love.

1211
01:24:03,401 --> 01:24:04,601
It was wonderful.

1212
01:24:05,521 --> 01:24:08,321
At first he was aloof, confused.

1213
01:24:09,801 --> 01:24:12,761
Like he couldn't control himself,
he was agitated...

1214
01:24:14,161 --> 01:24:16,001
he was flailing around.

1215
01:24:17,241 --> 01:24:19,641
I told him to relax.

1216
01:24:20,401 --> 01:24:22,521
Can you believe
I'm the one who said that?

1217
01:24:23,441 --> 01:24:25,601
Took his hands,

1218
01:24:26,121 --> 01:24:27,401
and said everything was fine.

1219
01:24:28,081 --> 01:24:30,841
That I was happy to be with him.

1220
01:24:32,201 --> 01:24:33,961
Were you really happy to do it?

1221
01:24:35,601 --> 01:24:37,161
With him, yes.

1222
01:24:40,561 --> 01:24:43,281
You asked to feel God again.

1223
01:24:44,761 --> 01:24:46,361
So?

1224
01:24:46,681 --> 01:24:48,281
D0 you ?

1225
01:24:48,481 --> 01:24:50,001
- Do you feel Him ?
- Yes.

1226
01:24:50,641 --> 01:24:51,881
I feel Him now too.

1227
01:24:54,441 --> 01:24:57,361
- What's He saying ?
- That I'll have a baby soon.

1228
01:25:03,881 --> 01:25:05,361
Did you tell Fulvio ?

1229
01:25:06,361 --> 01:25:07,561
No.

1230
01:25:08,081 --> 01:25:09,121
Why <i>'2</i>

1231
01:25:09,481 --> 01:25:10,841
It's odd...

1232
01:25:11,041 --> 01:25:13,521
it's as if I need to do this alone.

1233
01:25:14,161 --> 01:25:16,161
So you won't tell him ?

1234
01:25:19,121 --> 01:25:19,961
No.

1235
01:25:21,041 --> 01:25:23,641
All right, we're done.

1236
01:25:24,361 --> 01:25:25,841
Can I ask a question ?

1237
01:25:26,441 --> 01:25:28,841
Yes, but not the one you have in mind.

1238
01:25:29,441 --> 01:25:30,681
I can't answer that.

1239
01:25:35,281 --> 01:25:37,001
Thanks.

1240
01:25:48,281 --> 01:25:51,201
My son called me, we went out,
it was his idea.

1241
01:25:52,081 --> 01:25:53,641
We went out for pizza.

1242
01:25:53,961 --> 01:25:55,641
He didn't speak much, actually...

1243
01:25:55,801 --> 01:25:58,001
Then out of nowhere

1244
01:25:58,161 --> 01:26:01,401
he stood up and said "I love you".

1245
01:26:03,921 --> 01:26:05,201
Carry on.

1246
01:26:05,561 --> 01:26:08,321
He was lying, he wasn't being sincere.

1247
01:26:09,441 --> 01:26:12,961
- He didn't even look at me.
- Why would he have lied ?

1248
01:26:15,001 --> 01:26:17,081
Because he wanted something.

1249
01:26:17,281 --> 01:26:19,041
He's the son of a liar.

1250
01:26:20,001 --> 01:26:21,681
What can I expect ?

1251
01:26:22,321 --> 01:26:23,841
Is he back ?

1252
01:26:24,481 --> 01:26:26,001
You got what you wanted.

1253
01:26:26,321 --> 01:26:29,681
No, he's not back.
Anyway, I got what I deserved.

1254
01:26:34,161 --> 01:26:36,481
Remember that report I covered up ?

1255
01:26:39,441 --> 01:26:41,001
It was a young woman,

1256
01:26:41,161 --> 01:26:45,161
she said her husband
was hitting her out of jealousy.

1257
01:26:45,681 --> 01:26:47,241
She was scared.

1258
01:26:47,401 --> 01:26:50,561
He was convinced she was
having an affair with a neighbor.

1259
01:26:52,161 --> 01:26:54,241
She was crying in fear.

1260
01:26:56,161 --> 01:26:59,041
She had a black eye
and bruises on her arm.

1261
01:26:59,801 --> 01:27:02,681
Know what I did ?
I opened the wrong drawer

1262
01:27:04,321 --> 01:27:08,521
and let her life slip into the drawer
with bike theft reports.

1263
01:27:11,361 --> 01:27:13,361
I'm a real shitbag.

1264
01:27:14,641 --> 01:27:17,241
She was found dead yesterday.

1265
01:27:17,401 --> 01:27:21,521
Her skull was fractured
by multiple blows.

1266
01:27:24,081 --> 01:27:25,561
I was a shitty husband,

1267
01:27:26,561 --> 01:27:27,841
and a shitty father.

1268
01:27:28,001 --> 01:27:29,521
The truth is...

1269
01:27:29,721 --> 01:27:31,281
I'm a shitty cop too.

1270
01:27:33,001 --> 01:27:34,361
There's nothing good about me.

1271
01:27:34,921 --> 01:27:36,881
I'm going to talk to my bosses

1272
01:27:37,041 --> 01:27:38,801
and turn myself in.

1273
01:27:40,321 --> 01:27:41,921
You really want to do that ?

1274
01:27:43,161 --> 01:27:47,041
Yes, I do.
I have to start over somehow.

1275
01:27:47,801 --> 01:27:50,641
And this time,
I don't need you to do it.

1276
01:28:12,201 --> 01:28:14,081
I found the girl.

1277
01:28:21,281 --> 01:28:25,441
She was in a studio apartment
that was dreadful,

1278
01:28:26,921 --> 01:28:28,481
dirty...

1279
01:28:29,481 --> 01:28:31,841
surrounded by dolls

1280
01:28:32,481 --> 01:28:34,041
and bags of cookies.

1281
01:28:35,881 --> 01:28:37,881
She just stared at me,

1282
01:28:38,041 --> 01:28:40,641
she didn't say a word,
she just stared.

1283
01:28:41,881 --> 01:28:46,161
She'd hoped I was there to save her
but I wasn't there to save her.

1284
01:28:48,081 --> 01:28:51,161
While I walked toward her
with this rag to suffocate her,

1285
01:28:53,641 --> 01:28:55,361
I thought about my son.

1286
01:28:56,481 --> 01:28:57,761
And ?

1287
01:28:58,001 --> 01:29:00,161
I picked her up and took her away.

1288
01:29:01,121 --> 01:29:04,561
I called the police
and told them I'd found her.

1289
01:29:05,561 --> 01:29:07,201
And your son ?

1290
01:29:07,521 --> 01:29:09,641
I went to see him right after,

1291
01:29:10,641 --> 01:29:14,761
assuming I'd sit next to him
and hold him while he dies.

1292
01:29:18,441 --> 01:29:22,201
But I found out
his cancer disappeared.

1293
01:29:23,321 --> 01:29:25,641
Not remission,
the cancer disappeared.

1294
01:29:26,161 --> 01:29:27,321
Yesterday.

1295
01:29:28,001 --> 01:29:29,441
Miracle.

1296
01:29:32,321 --> 01:29:34,601
I'm happy for you, Luigi.

1297
01:29:37,041 --> 01:29:38,561
I didn't complete my task.

1298
01:29:40,841 --> 01:29:43,121
I never said he'd die if you didn't.

1299
01:29:43,641 --> 01:29:46,681
I almost killed a girl
because you asked me to.

1300
01:29:46,841 --> 01:29:48,721
You did it for you.

1301
01:29:49,721 --> 01:29:50,881
Remember that.

1302
01:29:52,441 --> 01:29:54,361
You're a monster.

1303
01:29:55,561 --> 01:29:58,161
Let's just say I feed monsters.

1304
01:30:56,121 --> 01:30:57,841
Any more robberies ?

1305
01:30:58,041 --> 01:30:59,281
No, no more.

1306
01:31:02,041 --> 01:31:04,081
Are you backing out?

1307
01:31:06,681 --> 01:31:08,761
We're moving in together.

1308
01:31:09,241 --> 01:31:10,321
Great.

1309
01:31:12,561 --> 01:31:14,081
Then we're done here.

1310
01:31:14,721 --> 01:31:15,881
Thanks.

1311
01:31:19,001 --> 01:31:20,761
Be careful with your magic.

1312
01:31:22,441 --> 01:31:23,881
- Let's go.
- Hold on.

1313
01:31:27,881 --> 01:31:29,641
I saw my dad yesterday.

1314
01:31:31,041 --> 01:31:32,881
He's in custody, you know.

1315
01:31:35,641 --> 01:31:38,121
I visited him in jail,
he turned himself in.

1316
01:31:38,481 --> 01:31:41,481
He says a woman died
because he didn't do his job.

1317
01:31:44,921 --> 01:31:47,201
- I felt sorry for him.
- Sorry ?

1318
01:31:48,001 --> 01:31:49,241
Sorry.

1319
01:31:49,841 --> 01:31:51,921
For the first time in my life.

1320
01:31:52,081 --> 01:31:55,841
I've always felt hatred for him
but yesterday he was pitiful.

1321
01:31:56,361 --> 01:31:58,801
He wasn't my dad but just a guy

1322
01:32:01,081 --> 01:32:03,121
who messed up everything.

1323
01:32:04,681 --> 01:32:06,561
I'm all he has now, right?

1324
01:32:07,641 --> 01:32:09,841
- Probably.
- Yeah.

1325
01:32:10,841 --> 01:32:12,521
The wrongdoer's victim remains.

1326
01:32:15,681 --> 01:32:18,761
You know, I didn't say I loved him.

1327
01:32:20,721 --> 01:32:22,361
But I think he felt it.

1328
01:32:24,201 --> 01:32:26,721
That's why Martina
changed her mind, right?

1329
01:32:27,721 --> 01:32:29,121
Could be.

1330
01:32:45,961 --> 01:32:47,561
I've decided.

1331
01:32:47,721 --> 01:32:49,881
I won't set off the bomb in that diner.

1332
01:32:50,761 --> 01:32:52,121
- No?
- No.

1333
01:32:53,561 --> 01:32:55,201
I'll set if off...

1334
01:32:55,361 --> 01:32:57,361
here, tonight.

1335
01:32:59,521 --> 01:33:00,721
See ?

1336
01:33:01,881 --> 01:33:03,841
Hear that ? Hear it ?

1337
01:33:05,601 --> 01:33:08,401
Tick tock, tick tock...

1338
01:33:08,561 --> 01:33:09,721
Like in films.

1339
01:33:10,681 --> 01:33:12,041
And this...

1340
01:33:12,241 --> 01:33:14,241
sets off the bomb.

1341
01:33:14,761 --> 01:33:15,881
See ?

1342
01:33:16,041 --> 01:33:18,481
I just have to press this button.

1343
01:33:27,561 --> 01:33:32,201
Don't tell me you're worried
about these people now.

1344
01:33:33,081 --> 01:33:35,241
I thought long and hard

1345
01:33:36,081 --> 01:33:37,801
and decided

1346
01:33:38,721 --> 01:33:41,161
that if I have to kill innocent people

1347
01:33:41,881 --> 01:33:44,641
then at least

1348
01:33:45,001 --> 01:33:47,561
I want to kill one guilty person.

1349
01:33:48,401 --> 01:33:49,681
Right ?

1350
01:33:53,681 --> 01:33:55,601
Then I thought...

1351
01:33:57,681 --> 01:34:01,321
when my husband comes home
and is well again

1352
01:34:01,721 --> 01:34:04,361
and is sitting across from me,

1353
01:34:05,441 --> 01:34:07,721
h0w'll I look him in the face ?

1354
01:34:08,521 --> 01:34:10,041
What'll I say to him ?

1355
01:34:10,481 --> 01:34:13,601
He'll be himself again

1356
01:34:14,441 --> 01:34:15,801
but me ?

1357
01:34:17,681 --> 01:34:19,561
I'll no longer be me.

1358
01:34:20,241 --> 01:34:21,601
I'll be like you.

1359
01:34:22,721 --> 01:34:24,681
And you...

1360
01:34:24,961 --> 01:34:26,881
disgust me.

1361
01:34:33,881 --> 01:34:35,161
I'll take this.

1362
01:34:37,721 --> 01:34:40,641
Wouldn't want you
to give it to someone else.

1363
01:35:32,401 --> 01:35:34,201
- Hello.
- Sorry...

1364
01:35:38,761 --> 01:35:40,961
I haven't been sleeping well lately.

1365
01:35:41,761 --> 01:35:44,641
You're finally telling me
something personal.

1366
01:35:45,601 --> 01:35:47,321
Tell me more.

1367
01:35:49,401 --> 01:35:52,361
Don't you have
your own dream or desire ?

1368
01:35:56,041 --> 01:35:57,161
Tell me.

1369
01:36:00,801 --> 01:36:02,961
I want to quit what I do.

1370
01:36:06,401 --> 01:36:08,721
No more hearing
about the ills of the world.

1371
01:36:16,721 --> 01:36:18,561
It's doable.

1372
01:41:07,881 --> 01:41:10,401

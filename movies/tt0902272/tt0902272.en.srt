00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:29,375
<i>Like all things on this hurtling sphere... </i>

3
00:00:29,545 --> 00:00:33,205
<i>... I emerged from the molten center</i>
<i>of creation. </i>

4
00:00:34,495 --> 00:00:37,245
<i>But mine has been a unique path. </i>

5
00:00:37,415 --> 00:00:42,755
<i>Isolated, I developed attributes</i>
<i>beyond those of lesser beings. </i>

6
00:00:46,415 --> 00:00:50,455
<i>Then the sphere was struck</i>
<i>by a vast celestial stone. </i>

7
00:00:53,165 --> 00:00:56,875
<i>Black chunks of death filled the skies... </i>

8
00:00:57,045 --> 00:01:00,755
<i>... and the world</i>
<i>became a chaotic garden of doom. </i>

9
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:06,085
<i>Soon the sphere began</i>
<i>to nurture new kinds of life. </i>

10
00:01:06,245 --> 00:01:08,965
<i>And there was one</i>
<i>that stood above all the rest. </i>

11
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:12,245
<i>Its fragile shell belied its vicious nature. </i>

12
00:01:12,415 --> 00:01:14,335
<i>And in what seemed like a heartbeat... </i>

13
00:01:14,585 --> 00:01:19,835
<i>... these things proliferated in both number</i>
<i>and destructive means. </i>

14
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:26,245
<i>Now they have harnessed</i>
<i>the most destructive force. </i>

15
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:31,755
<i>And I, The Centre, have concluded... </i>

16
00:01:31,915 --> 00:01:35,545
<i>... that the sphere</i>
<i>must be cleansed of them. </i>

17
00:04:02,045 --> 00:04:04,795
<i>This is Lois Lane on Armed Forces Radio. </i>

18
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:08,795
<i>Well, boys, it looks like the party's over. </i>
<i>They signed the ceasefire. </i>

19
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:11,415
<i>So have a drink and smoke them</i>
<i>if you got them. </i>

20
00:04:11,755 --> 00:04:13,965
<i>We're going home. </i>

21
00:04:20,335 --> 00:04:23,965
Some way to end a war, huh, kid?
Nobody wins, nobody loses.

22
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,625
Long as it's over, Ace. I got plans.

23
00:04:26,795 --> 00:04:29,285
Right, I forgot.
You're gonna be a space ranger.

24
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,045
The proper term is "test pilot,"
funny man.

25
00:04:33,415 --> 00:04:36,795
I'm gonna see the stars, close up.

26
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:39,705
Hey.

27
00:04:43,205 --> 00:04:45,795
Sons of bitches must not have heard
about the ceasefire.

28
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:53,165
<i>I'm coming back for you. </i>
Try using your guns for a change.

29
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:07,795
<i>Can you make it back now, Ace? </i>

30
00:05:08,005 --> 00:05:10,585
Roger that.
Gotta get me a new pair of skivvies.

31
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,085
Got another bogey.

32
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,495
<i>Hal, your engine. </i>

33
00:05:21,665 --> 00:05:23,005
<i>Punch out. Punch out! </i>

34
00:06:08,005 --> 00:06:11,125
Listen to me. War over.

35
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,875
Finished.

36
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:34,585
It's over.

37
00:06:35,165 --> 00:06:37,835
War over.

38
00:07:01,495 --> 00:07:03,755
I'm so sorry.

39
00:07:03,915 --> 00:07:08,915
All I wanted was to send a signal
to Mars.

40
00:07:09,755 --> 00:07:13,795
How could I have known
it would teleport you here?

41
00:07:17,285 --> 00:07:20,795
I suppose we both got the shock
of our lives.

42
00:07:21,965 --> 00:07:26,755
But your heart must be stronger
than mine.

43
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,705
Whoever you are...

44
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,795
...forgive me.

45
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:30,495
Come on in, Kal.

46
00:08:31,205 --> 00:08:33,005
Join the celebration.

47
00:08:33,455 --> 00:08:35,705
Diana, what's going on here?

48
00:08:36,285 --> 00:08:38,285
Tell them they'd be wasting their bullets.

49
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:43,625
Don't judge them, Kal.
They get a little nervous around men now.

50
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,375
- What are you talking about?
- I was heading upriver...

51
00:08:46,545 --> 00:08:48,875
...when I passed this village
about four days ago.

52
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:51,875
The people here helped the French.
The rebels didn't like that.

53
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:55,205
They murdered the men and children
and they threw them in the river.

54
00:08:55,375 --> 00:09:00,835
<i>These women were beaten and penned</i>
<i>in tiger cages for the rebels to use. </i>

55
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,125
<i>The rebels, how did they die? </i>

56
00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:05,795
<i>I only disarmed them. </i>

57
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:11,705
<i>I left their guns in a clearing and</i>
<i>then I let the women out of their cages. </i>

58
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:18,965
They did this?

59
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,165
And you just stood by and watched?

60
00:09:21,335 --> 00:09:23,585
I gave them freedom
and a chance for justice.

61
00:09:23,755 --> 00:09:26,965
You know, the American way.

62
00:09:27,335 --> 00:09:29,965
This is what the government's afraid of,
Diana.

63
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,205
Us acting like vigilantes.

64
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,375
I have to do what I think is right.

65
00:09:34,795 --> 00:09:37,045
That's what the others said at first,
remember?

66
00:09:37,335 --> 00:09:40,585
And now Batman's a fugitive,
the whole Justice Society's retired...

67
00:09:40,755 --> 00:09:42,705
...and Hourman's dead.

68
00:09:43,205 --> 00:09:44,665
No matter how much good we do...

69
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,875
...deep down, people are always
going to be scared of us.

70
00:09:48,205 --> 00:09:51,045
Isn't that why you and I
signed those loyalty oaths?

71
00:09:51,205 --> 00:09:52,545
Take a look around, Kal.

72
00:09:53,165 --> 00:09:55,165
Oaths don't mean much here.

73
00:09:55,335 --> 00:09:57,585
All I see is suffering and madness.

74
00:09:58,585 --> 00:10:01,285
- But...
- There's the door, spaceman.

75
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,585
Yeah.

76
00:10:04,755 --> 00:10:06,625
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

77
00:10:06,795 --> 00:10:08,335
Yeah.

78
00:10:50,965 --> 00:10:55,455
<i>MAN 1 The downed pilot insisted</i>
<i>the island was teeming with dinosaurs... </i>

79
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,005
<i>... but Navy sources claim</i>
<i>a search revealed... </i>

80
00:10:58,165 --> 00:11:02,915
<i>... that not only were there no dinosaurs, </i>
<i>there wasn't even an island. </i>

81
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:04,455
<i>ln other news... </i>

82
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,835
<i>Well, I don't know, Groucho, </i>
<i>that's not really what I meant. </i>

83
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:11,335
<i>We keep our farm animals in the farm, </i>
<i>not in the house. </i>

84
00:11:11,495 --> 00:11:13,795
<i>Not in the bedroom, certainly. </i>

85
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,625
<i>Eh, what's up, doc? </i>

86
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:25,005
<i>This now concludes our broadcasting day. </i>

87
00:11:32,755 --> 00:11:35,375
The last I heard,
she went back to Paradise Island.

88
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:37,415
It sounds like she's lost her mind.

89
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,375
I don't think it's that simple.

90
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:42,875
Diana's an Amazon
who's become an American.

91
00:11:43,045 --> 00:11:45,375
She's trying to make sense
of her convictions.

92
00:11:45,545 --> 00:11:48,495
Between her and that Batman character...

93
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:51,545
- I thought these people were your friends.
- They are.

94
00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:54,795
But neither of them would sacrifice
their principles for a friend.

95
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:58,205
- Ever since McCarthy came to...
- McCarthy. He's no excuse.

96
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:02,705
Whatever party, whatever administration,
there'll always be boogeymen like him.

97
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,665
We need our heroes to stand up...

98
00:12:04,795 --> 00:12:08,165
...and show us what this country
is supposed to mean.

99
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:13,875
We need a leader.

100
00:12:31,755 --> 00:12:34,045
Come on, roll it.
Come on, eight. Come on, eight.

101
00:12:34,205 --> 00:12:35,705
Yes.

102
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:39,495
Ten's the number to win.

103
00:12:39,665 --> 00:12:42,165
Now why don't you tell me
what we're doing here, Ace?

104
00:12:42,335 --> 00:12:44,915
Told you, Hal, it's a surprise.

105
00:12:45,335 --> 00:12:46,625
You'll find out tomorrow.

106
00:12:47,085 --> 00:12:50,205
Now, roll those dice before they cool off.

107
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:55,545
Come on, 10.

108
00:12:56,005 --> 00:12:58,005
Ten. It's a winner.

109
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:02,705
And you have the loveliest light
in your eyes, dig?

110
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:07,455
- Can we get back to the interview, please?
- Oh, yeah. My philosophy of life.

111
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,875
Tell your readers they gotta do what I do,
live for the moment...

112
00:13:11,045 --> 00:13:14,045
...because it might be our last,
you dig, Miss West?

113
00:13:14,205 --> 00:13:16,375
- Very profound.
- That's me.

114
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:20,795
I've always been, you know,
deep like that.

115
00:13:21,915 --> 00:13:23,375
Time for the sound check, boss.

116
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:29,755
Back in a moment.

117
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,285
I'll try to live for it.

118
00:13:33,835 --> 00:13:37,665
<i>I tell you, these two heavyweights</i>
<i>are giving us quite a show tonight. </i>

119
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:41,205
<i>Oh, it looks like it'll have to wait</i>
<i>for the next round, folks. </i>

120
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,915
<i>Meantime, we've got the champ... </i>

121
00:13:44,245 --> 00:13:46,375
<i>... Ted "Wildcat" Grant, </i>
<i>solidly ahead on points. </i>

122
00:13:46,545 --> 00:13:48,005
- Uh, hello.
<i>Hello, Barry? </i>

123
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:50,415
Iris. I thought you had to work tonight.

124
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:51,835
I do.

125
00:13:52,005 --> 00:13:54,455
But I wanted to tell you
how much I miss you.

126
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,285
- You have no idea.
- Come on, how could you miss me?

127
00:13:57,455 --> 00:14:00,585
You're in Las Vegas interviewing
all those singers and movie stars.

128
00:14:00,755 --> 00:14:01,795
<i>It's the fast lane. </i>

129
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:05,415
There are lots of potholes
in that lane, let me tell you.

130
00:14:07,495 --> 00:14:09,005
Iris? Iris.

131
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:19,545
Sorry to interrupt your festivities,
but if you all stay calm...

132
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:24,835
...we'll be gone as soon as my friends here
come back from the cashiers' booths.

133
00:14:29,165 --> 00:14:33,205
The key phrase was "stay calm."

134
00:14:36,495 --> 00:14:37,795
<i>Iris, what's happening? </i>

135
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,495
You there.

136
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,545
The naughty girl on the phone.

137
00:14:44,705 --> 00:14:45,965
Iris!

138
00:15:04,455 --> 00:15:06,585
Just a few more seconds, everyone.

139
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:09,915
Ah, my ride is here.

140
00:15:25,085 --> 00:15:27,085
Wait.

141
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,165
Make it quick.

142
00:15:30,205 --> 00:15:33,165
Hot damn, Ace.
It's that super-fast guy from Central City.

143
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,415
The Flash. He'll take care of this clown.

144
00:15:35,795 --> 00:15:37,965
I took precautions
in case you dropped by.

145
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:39,755
If you so much as touch me...

146
00:15:39,915 --> 00:15:43,245
...you'll trigger six cryogenic bombs
I've hidden around the city.

147
00:15:43,415 --> 00:15:46,965
And they'll go off in 90 seconds anyway,
unless you find them.

148
00:15:47,335 --> 00:15:53,285
So it's your choice now.
Me, or the city and everyone in it.

149
00:15:53,455 --> 00:15:55,625
Eighty-nine, 88...

150
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:00,875
One...

151
00:16:01,455 --> 00:16:02,755
...two, three, four...

152
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,755
...five. Where's six?

153
00:16:53,665 --> 00:16:56,545
It took me a second or two,
but I figured out the sixth bomb...

154
00:16:56,755 --> 00:16:58,495
...was just a wild-goose chase.

155
00:16:58,665 --> 00:17:03,545
You are different
from the other lesser beings. Faster.

156
00:17:03,705 --> 00:17:06,705
- Why?
- Lesser beings?

157
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,205
What are you talking about?

158
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,545
Eh? Wha...?

159
00:17:15,455 --> 00:17:16,495
What did you do?

160
00:17:16,665 --> 00:17:19,005
I rewired it on the way down.

161
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,335
Don't ever mess with my Iris.

162
00:18:09,915 --> 00:18:11,285
This little trip's been fun.

163
00:18:11,455 --> 00:18:13,665
Are you ever gonna tell me
where we're headed?

164
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:16,915
To hell if you don't slow down.
What's wrong with you?

165
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:19,585
Ever since you got out of the hospital...

166
00:18:19,755 --> 00:18:21,625
It was Korea.

167
00:18:22,495 --> 00:18:23,755
Changed everything.

168
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,915
Wars have a tendency to do that.

169
00:18:26,085 --> 00:18:28,625
Look, Ace, you know
that ever since I was a kid...

170
00:18:28,795 --> 00:18:32,375
...watching my old man fly,
I wanted to see the stars.

171
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,705
But the war and then the hospital...

172
00:18:35,165 --> 00:18:37,205
...it's like I'm damaged goods.

173
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:41,125
I can't get a first-class outfit
to take me on. And without a ride...

174
00:18:41,665 --> 00:18:43,285
...I sure can't climb the pyramid.

175
00:18:44,205 --> 00:18:46,285
- Slow down.
- Why bother?

176
00:18:46,665 --> 00:18:49,495
You have to, kid, because we're here.

177
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:06,005
It's where you get your second chance.

178
00:19:07,335 --> 00:19:09,495
<i>How did you know he was the commie? </i>

179
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:12,835
<i>He came back for the formula, </i>
<i>that's what nailed it. </i>

180
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:14,705
<i>He could've killed you. </i>

181
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,495
<i>Like I always say, </i>
<i>when you know you're right... </i>

182
00:19:17,915 --> 00:19:19,495
<i>... it's worth taking a chance. </i>

183
00:19:19,965 --> 00:19:22,005
<i>Now, come here. </i>

184
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:45,705
Ace Morgan's recommendation
carries a lot of weight at Ferris Aircraft.

185
00:19:46,045 --> 00:19:48,045
I assume he spoke as well of us to you.

186
00:19:48,335 --> 00:19:52,875
He did. And I can't imagine anywhere else
I'd rather be right now, Miss Ferris.

187
00:19:53,835 --> 00:19:56,375
Do you have any questions?

188
00:19:57,045 --> 00:19:59,545
I'm surprised your father
isn't interviewing me.

189
00:19:59,705 --> 00:20:02,545
- Not that I mind, it's just that you're a...
- A woman?

190
00:20:02,705 --> 00:20:05,705
My father trusts me with the day-to-day
operation of the company.

191
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,915
- If that's good enough for him, it ought to...
- Whoa, wait.

192
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:13,665
I was only saying that you're a little young
to be running a major corporation.

193
00:20:14,085 --> 00:20:16,415
Oh. Oh, you're good, flyboy...

194
00:20:16,585 --> 00:20:18,915
...but save it for the girls
in the typing pool.

195
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:20,415
One last question.

196
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:24,205
In your resume, there's a gap
between July and December of '53.

197
00:20:25,005 --> 00:20:27,205
I was in a VA hospital.

198
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,415
Psych ward.

199
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,415
Most people wouldn't talk about
this kind of thing...

200
00:20:33,585 --> 00:20:35,545
...but I learned a lot about myself there.

201
00:20:35,705 --> 00:20:38,755
I came out knowing who I really am
and what I really want.

202
00:20:40,165 --> 00:20:43,205
You report for training
and security clearance in two weeks.

203
00:20:43,915 --> 00:20:45,495
All right, let's celebrate.

204
00:20:45,665 --> 00:20:47,835
Waiter, some champagne.

205
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:51,335
Look, Hal,
I don't get involved with my employees.

206
00:20:51,495 --> 00:20:52,585
I understand, Carol...

207
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:55,045
...but I don't start work
for two more weeks.

208
00:20:56,585 --> 00:20:58,005
Two glasses.

209
00:21:02,545 --> 00:21:06,495
- So where'd this hot tip come from, John?
- A source.

210
00:21:07,755 --> 00:21:09,625
Well, I think I know your secret.

211
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:11,875
- You do?
- Hm.

212
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,045
The tips you get from out of the blue...

213
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:17,045
...those hunches of yours
that always turn out to be right.

214
00:21:18,335 --> 00:21:20,085
You're dating a fortuneteller.

215
00:21:20,455 --> 00:21:21,915
No, I...

216
00:21:23,705 --> 00:21:25,625
Something like that.

217
00:21:35,245 --> 00:21:38,585
Try the back.
I'll see if I can pick this lock.

218
00:22:25,495 --> 00:22:26,915
You are the tribute.

219
00:22:27,085 --> 00:22:29,755
Yours is the glory
of nourishing the strength...

220
00:22:30,005 --> 00:22:32,085
...of The Centre.

221
00:22:43,915 --> 00:22:45,835
You okay, John?

222
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,245
No, stay away.

223
00:22:57,415 --> 00:22:59,205
Stay away!

224
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:02,085
Back off, you're scaring the boy.

225
00:23:04,545 --> 00:23:06,665
You'll be all right now that...

226
00:23:12,835 --> 00:23:14,755
You will be judged too.

227
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:17,965
You will all be judged.

228
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:22,005
Without The Centre, there is no holding.

229
00:23:22,665 --> 00:23:25,835
The Centre? What's The Centre?

230
00:23:51,165 --> 00:23:52,665
<i>Jordan, do you copy? </i>

231
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:55,665
<i>Negative, Colonel Flagg, no Jordan here... </i>

232
00:23:56,455 --> 00:23:58,795
...just Spam in a can.
<i>Cut the comedy. </i>

233
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,455
Are you go for 72?

234
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,665
<i>Yes, Captain Personality. </i>

235
00:24:03,835 --> 00:24:06,285
<i>Jordan is go for exercise 72.</i>

236
00:24:06,755 --> 00:24:09,625
<i>- Hit it. </i>
- My pleasure.

237
00:24:30,245 --> 00:24:34,165
Spam Jordan is now go for exercise 73.

238
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:37,795
- How's he doing?
- He's tough enough, that's for sure.

239
00:24:37,965 --> 00:24:41,085
- But I'm getting sick of his attitude.
- He's a pilot, Colonel Flagg.

240
00:24:41,245 --> 00:24:43,625
He's used to making decisions
and being in control.

241
00:24:43,795 --> 00:24:45,795
This training goes against his nature.

242
00:24:46,045 --> 00:24:48,335
Can't be helped.
It's all part of the big picture.

243
00:24:48,665 --> 00:24:51,005
Which he hasn't seen yet.

244
00:24:57,285 --> 00:24:58,455
Carol.

245
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:00,835
I mean, Miss Ferris, afternoon.

246
00:25:01,005 --> 00:25:04,245
Afternoon, Mr. Jordan.
I trust Colonel Flagg is keeping you busy.

247
00:25:04,415 --> 00:25:07,205
This stuff? Child's play, Miss Ferris.

248
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:09,335
- Perhaps later I could show you...
Jordan.

249
00:25:09,495 --> 00:25:11,915
- What?
- Exercise 73, remember?

250
00:25:12,085 --> 00:25:14,705
Yeah, they tell me 73's the charm.

251
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,875
Good day, Miss Ferris.

252
00:25:21,835 --> 00:25:23,705
- What are his numbers, Harry?
- Uh...

253
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:26,835
Excellent.
Responses in the 99th percentile.

254
00:25:29,165 --> 00:25:29,835
Hm.

255
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:46,165
Not that I'm complaining,
but where exactly are you taking me?

256
00:25:46,585 --> 00:25:50,045
- Where have you always wanted to go?
- That's a leading question.

257
00:25:50,205 --> 00:25:52,045
No, I mean, since you were a kid.

258
00:25:52,205 --> 00:25:55,335
- Your big goal?
- The stars.

259
00:25:55,495 --> 00:25:59,495
But at the rate we're going, the Russians
are gonna beat us into orbit by months.

260
00:25:59,665 --> 00:26:02,125
Who said anything about orbit?

261
00:26:02,285 --> 00:26:04,005
Whoa!

262
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:21,665
A hole in the ground.

263
00:26:22,085 --> 00:26:23,665
Isn't that the wrong direction?

264
00:26:24,005 --> 00:26:27,045
Sometimes you have to go through hell
to get to heaven.

265
00:26:36,415 --> 00:26:38,585
What is all this?

266
00:26:41,005 --> 00:26:43,585
Welcome to the real Ferris Aircraft.

267
00:27:00,455 --> 00:27:02,245
See that sour-looking man down there?

268
00:27:02,545 --> 00:27:03,705
He'll explain everything.

269
00:27:04,705 --> 00:27:06,085
His name's Faraday.

270
00:27:06,245 --> 00:27:08,455
Works for the government.

271
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:11,705
And if you like Rick Flagg,
you'll love him.

272
00:27:13,455 --> 00:27:15,875
You're weak, erratic, emotional...

273
00:27:16,045 --> 00:27:20,285
...and for my money, at least a little pink.
But I'm told you're the best we've got.

274
00:27:21,795 --> 00:27:23,415
- I...
- You keep your mouth shut...

275
00:27:23,755 --> 00:27:24,875
...and your ears open.

276
00:27:25,045 --> 00:27:28,335
I'm about to share some of this nation's
greatest secrets with you.

277
00:27:37,415 --> 00:27:41,625
Couple of years ago, we found the body
of a radical scientist named Erdel...

278
00:27:41,795 --> 00:27:44,005
...in a small observatory near Gotham.

279
00:27:44,165 --> 00:27:46,965
Somehow,
he'd been able to contact Mars.

280
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:50,285
Mars? You're joking, right?

281
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:53,875
Yes, Jordan, I'm a real kidder.

282
00:27:54,545 --> 00:27:57,335
We found this footprint
at the observatory.

283
00:27:58,755 --> 00:28:01,165
Did you find what made that print?

284
00:28:01,335 --> 00:28:02,415
No.

285
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:06,455
Whatever it is,
it's eluded us for two years.

286
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:08,915
There's life on Mars, Jordan.

287
00:28:09,085 --> 00:28:10,795
And it's come to Earth.

288
00:28:11,835 --> 00:28:14,795
Look, I'm just a pilot.
What does this have to do with me?

289
00:28:23,205 --> 00:28:25,125
You haven't figured it out yet?

290
00:28:25,795 --> 00:28:28,205
We've got to know what these Martians
want from us...

291
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:31,045
...and since we can't find them
here on Earth...

292
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:32,965
...we're going to Mars.

293
00:28:37,455 --> 00:28:39,375
Outstanding.

294
00:28:48,245 --> 00:28:50,415
Welcome home, Mr. Jones.

295
00:28:50,585 --> 00:28:51,585
Why didn't I...?

296
00:28:51,755 --> 00:28:53,755
Why didn't you sense me as you do others?

297
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:56,165
That's my secret.

298
00:28:56,965 --> 00:28:59,665
Why are you here?
Because of The Centre?

299
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:03,285
The cult's spreading all over the world.

300
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:05,665
At first I thought it might be
the communists.

301
00:29:05,835 --> 00:29:07,965
But they're having trouble
with the cults too.

302
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:09,495
It's not ideological.

303
00:29:09,795 --> 00:29:11,795
There's some kind
of psychic force involved.

304
00:29:11,965 --> 00:29:14,415
It's affecting people
with high susceptibility.

305
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:17,045
Getting into their minds.

306
00:29:17,205 --> 00:29:18,415
I felt it.

307
00:29:18,755 --> 00:29:21,915
Yes, your feelings. How...?

308
00:29:22,085 --> 00:29:24,245
Let's just say that's my secret.

309
00:29:24,415 --> 00:29:27,245
You came here because
you want to work together, true?

310
00:29:27,415 --> 00:29:29,965
- True.
- Then we'll share our information.

311
00:29:30,965 --> 00:29:32,625
I've already collected some.

312
00:29:37,455 --> 00:29:38,755
Newspaper clippings.

313
00:29:38,915 --> 00:29:41,085
You'll have to do better than that.

314
00:29:41,585 --> 00:29:46,625
And one other thing, I'm not sure
what you are or where you come from...

315
00:29:46,795 --> 00:29:49,875
...but my instincts tell me
you're to be trusted.

316
00:29:50,045 --> 00:29:51,875
Make no mistake, though.

317
00:29:52,045 --> 00:29:54,665
I have a $70,000 sliver
of radioactive meteor...

318
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:56,455
...to stop the one from Metropolis.

319
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,835
With you, all I need is a penny
for a book of matches.

320
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:22,585
What's the matter, Grodd,
feeling starved for attention?

321
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:52,045
You're government property now, swifty.

322
00:30:52,205 --> 00:30:55,005
We're gonna find out
what makes you tick.

323
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:04,545
Hey.
Did you see that?

324
00:31:04,705 --> 00:31:06,585
Where did he go?

325
00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:17,205
What you got there, John?

326
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:19,835
- A kids' book?
- Not exactly.

327
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:22,415
The author committed suicide
a while back.

328
00:31:22,585 --> 00:31:24,585
He thought the world was about to end.

329
00:31:24,755 --> 00:31:26,665
You like this weird stuff, don't you?

330
00:31:26,835 --> 00:31:30,125
Well, you should see what they got
in the interrogation room.

331
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:33,085
He shot a cop on the parkway.

332
00:31:33,245 --> 00:31:34,915
Then we found his mother...

333
00:31:35,085 --> 00:31:36,915
...in his trunk.

334
00:31:37,285 --> 00:31:39,375
- Mental case?
- Not your typical one.

335
00:31:39,545 --> 00:31:42,005
This guy's a scientist.

336
00:31:44,755 --> 00:31:47,835
You're here to kill me, aren't you?
You're part of it.

337
00:31:48,005 --> 00:31:50,085
I'm not going to kill you.

338
00:31:50,245 --> 00:31:52,335
And what do you think I'm part of?

339
00:31:52,495 --> 00:31:54,585
The Centre. It's everywhere.

340
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:57,045
What do you know about The Centre?

341
00:31:57,205 --> 00:32:00,085
It's gonna kill everyone.
I was trying to get away from it.

342
00:32:00,245 --> 00:32:01,875
How do you know all this?

343
00:32:02,245 --> 00:32:05,665
I just do. I can feel it.

344
00:32:06,085 --> 00:32:10,085
I tried to get in on the Mars mission
but they wouldn't take me.

345
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:11,665
The Mars mission?

346
00:32:12,005 --> 00:32:14,545
Yes. They're going to Mars.
It's safe there.

347
00:32:14,705 --> 00:32:17,545
- Who is going to Mars?
- The government.

348
00:32:17,705 --> 00:32:20,585
They won't let us normal people go.

349
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:22,915
Normal people.

350
00:32:24,585 --> 00:32:26,375
Hello, Harry.

351
00:32:27,285 --> 00:32:29,245
I've been very worried about you.

352
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:31,455
No! Don't let him near me.

353
00:32:31,965 --> 00:32:33,965
Special Agent Faraday.

354
00:32:34,335 --> 00:32:36,415
Harry used to be a hell of a scientist.

355
00:32:36,585 --> 00:32:38,205
Did lots of classified stuff.

356
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:42,005
We can't leave him in a regular institution
because of what he might spill.

357
00:32:42,165 --> 00:32:43,915
You're referring to the Mars mission?

358
00:32:44,915 --> 00:32:47,755
- The what?
- He told me about a mission to Mars.

359
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:53,545
He's even farther gone than I thought.
If that's possible.

360
00:32:53,835 --> 00:32:56,545
- Now, come on, Harry.
No, please don't let him take me.

361
00:32:56,705 --> 00:32:58,665
Please, please.

362
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:08,455
Mr. Faraday, if there's anything else
I can do for you, please let me know.

363
00:33:09,205 --> 00:33:10,625
Sure.

364
00:33:12,495 --> 00:33:14,665
<i>We've been able to contact Mars. </i>
<i>Life on Mars. </i>

365
00:33:14,835 --> 00:33:17,005
<i>We're going to Mars. </i>

366
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,455
See you around, Jones.

367
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:25,125
<i>lt's all true. </i>

368
00:33:26,165 --> 00:33:27,965
<i>Wilson's vigilante activities... </i>

369
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:31,495
<i>... kept the local white supremacists</i>
<i>at bay for years... </i>

370
00:33:31,665 --> 00:33:35,625
<i>... but his luck ran out yesterday</i>
<i>when he was caught by a mob and killed. </i>

371
00:33:36,005 --> 00:33:38,205
<i>Police say they have no suspects. </i>

372
00:33:38,545 --> 00:33:40,085
<i>ln other news... Hey. </i>

373
00:33:40,245 --> 00:33:43,375
<i>Sorry to interrupt. There's something</i>
<i>I have to get off my chest. </i>

374
00:33:43,545 --> 00:33:45,545
<i>I've always used my power</i>
<i>to help people... </i>

375
00:33:45,705 --> 00:33:48,665
<i>... but the government's on my tail, </i>
<i>hunting me like a criminal. </i>

376
00:33:48,835 --> 00:33:50,835
<i>You just saw what happened</i>
<i>to John Wilson. </i>

377
00:33:51,005 --> 00:33:52,705
<i>America needs more people like him. </i>

378
00:33:52,965 --> 00:33:56,545
<i>But where are they going to come from</i>
<i>if our government keeps acting this way? </i>

379
00:33:56,875 --> 00:34:00,965
<i>As for me, I'm quitting, giving it up. </i>

380
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:05,045
<i>Breaks my heart but there are people I love. </i>
<i>I don't want anything to happen to them. </i>

381
00:34:05,205 --> 00:34:09,285
<i>So good night, everybody, and good luck. </i>

382
00:34:12,205 --> 00:34:15,045
- Who needed him anyway?
- Probably some kind of crook.

383
00:34:15,205 --> 00:34:17,545
- Definitely a freak.
- Definitely.

384
00:34:17,705 --> 00:34:21,585
And what was with that red costume?
Red's for commies.

385
00:34:22,245 --> 00:34:25,165
- Hey, where are you going?
Home.

386
00:34:57,545 --> 00:34:59,285
Mr. Jones...

387
00:34:59,585 --> 00:35:00,915
...how did you locate me?

388
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:05,375
I may not be the world's greatest
detective, but I have my methods.

389
00:35:05,755 --> 00:35:08,285
This is all the information
I've been able to collect.

390
00:35:08,455 --> 00:35:09,585
It's the last of it.

391
00:35:11,335 --> 00:35:15,205
I thought I could make a life for myself
here among you humans.

392
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:17,585
I didn't think I had a choice.

393
00:35:17,755 --> 00:35:19,085
But there is one now.

394
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:24,125
There's just too much hatred here,
too much ignorance...

395
00:35:24,285 --> 00:35:27,085
...too much mindless conformity.

396
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:29,125
I'm leaving.

397
00:35:30,285 --> 00:35:31,455
Have a nice trip.

398
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:33,545
Some of us don't have that luxury.

399
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:44,205
Flying Cloud, status report.

400
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:46,665
Flying Cloud is go. Secure for launch.

401
00:35:46,835 --> 00:35:48,085
- Jordan?
- Go.

402
00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:51,585
<i>Good luck, Flying Cloud. </i>
God be with you.

403
00:36:19,795 --> 00:36:21,495
Go for launch on all points.

404
00:36:21,965 --> 00:36:23,965
<i>Roger, we are go for launch. </i>

405
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:35,705
Ignition sequence start.

406
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,755
<i>Primary engines engaged. </i>

407
00:36:40,705 --> 00:36:42,335
<i>All engines running. </i>

408
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:48,705
Don't move, Martian.

409
00:36:51,755 --> 00:36:55,795
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven... </i>

410
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:57,665
<i>... six, five... </i>

411
00:36:58,085 --> 00:37:01,705
<i>... four, three, two, one. </i>

412
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:51,915
Almost there.

413
00:38:03,705 --> 00:38:04,915
We're losing pressure.

414
00:38:10,285 --> 00:38:13,085
- We're gonna have to take her back.
- Too risky.

415
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:14,375
Jordan, listen to me.

416
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:16,965
- We have weapons on board.
- What?

417
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:19,285
In case the Martians
turned out to be hostile.

418
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:23,755
Nerve gas, germ bombs, even nuclear.

419
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:27,795
Doesn't make a difference.
I can still land this thing.

420
00:38:29,415 --> 00:38:31,335
- What's that?
- It's a destruct switch.

421
00:38:31,795 --> 00:38:34,415
I'm sorry, Jordan,
but you knew the risks.

422
00:38:37,755 --> 00:38:38,835
You just relax, colonel.

423
00:38:39,005 --> 00:38:41,005
I'll have you on the ground in no time.

424
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:43,495
What's going on there?
<i>Come in, Flying Cloud. </i>

425
00:38:43,665 --> 00:38:46,335
<i>We've had an engine failure. </i>
<i>I'm gonna glide her back. </i>

426
00:38:46,495 --> 00:38:47,915
Negative, it's too dangerous.

427
00:38:48,085 --> 00:38:50,545
- Where's Flagg?
<i>Don't worry about him... </i>

428
00:38:50,705 --> 00:38:53,335
<i>... or your weapons. They'll both be okay. </i>

429
00:38:53,495 --> 00:38:55,165
Weapons?

430
00:38:56,245 --> 00:38:58,795
You son of a bitch.

431
00:38:59,585 --> 00:39:01,085
Jordan, put Flagg back on.

432
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:04,245
No can do, Faraday. He's indisposed.

433
00:39:06,495 --> 00:39:07,915
Call in the big guy.

434
00:39:24,205 --> 00:39:25,835
Flagg, don't. I can land it.

435
00:39:26,005 --> 00:39:28,625
I can't bet the world on that, Jordan.

436
00:41:51,085 --> 00:41:52,125
Nuclear weapons?

437
00:41:52,285 --> 00:41:54,085
Nerve gas? What were you thinking?

438
00:41:54,415 --> 00:41:57,005
We didn't know. We're still not sure.

439
00:41:57,165 --> 00:41:58,285
Of what, exactly?

440
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:00,665
If we can trust him.

441
00:42:00,835 --> 00:42:03,455
You trust me and I'm an alien.
Yeah, but...

442
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:06,375
It's because he looks
so different, isn't it?

443
00:42:06,755 --> 00:42:09,545
- You have to admit...
- Listen, you've seen the power he has.

444
00:42:09,705 --> 00:42:11,755
He could leave this place
any time he wants.

445
00:42:11,915 --> 00:42:13,455
But he hasn't.

446
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:16,045
That should tell you something.

447
00:42:23,045 --> 00:42:25,625
Tell me about this America, Diana.

448
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:27,545
It's changed since the war.

449
00:42:27,705 --> 00:42:30,835
Back then, we were in the right.
It was simple.

450
00:42:33,045 --> 00:42:36,045
They still say they're in the right
but they don't act that way.

451
00:42:36,285 --> 00:42:37,545
Men.

452
00:42:42,835 --> 00:42:44,705
Things have changed here too, Diana.

453
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:48,585
A lot of us are beginning to think we need
a leader who sticks closer to home.

454
00:42:48,965 --> 00:42:50,875
And who would such a leader be?

455
00:42:51,045 --> 00:42:52,585
You?

456
00:42:59,915 --> 00:43:02,625
You might need a little more seasoning.

457
00:44:35,495 --> 00:44:37,085
Hal Jordan.

458
00:44:37,915 --> 00:44:39,455
You know me?

459
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:41,085
Who are you?

460
00:44:41,455 --> 00:44:43,665
I am...

461
00:44:44,455 --> 00:44:46,125
...Abin Sur.

462
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:48,875
You need a doctor. Let me...

463
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:51,375
Listen to me.

464
00:44:51,545 --> 00:44:56,045
What I have to tell you
will seem unbelievable but...

465
00:44:59,045 --> 00:45:03,835
I am the Green Lantern of Sector 2814.

466
00:45:04,005 --> 00:45:06,625
I was on my way here to help.

467
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:08,705
Help? How?

468
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:13,545
In the coming battle with The Centre.

469
00:45:13,705 --> 00:45:15,045
Center of what?

470
00:45:15,335 --> 00:45:20,705
It is a monstrous creature
that fears you humans so much...

471
00:45:21,245 --> 00:45:26,375
...it intends to eradicate every
living soul on the planet.

472
00:45:27,545 --> 00:45:30,875
When I was entering your atmosphere
a few days ago...

473
00:45:31,045 --> 00:45:34,045
...there was a huge explosion.

474
00:45:34,415 --> 00:45:37,625
There was too much yellow energy
for me.

475
00:45:37,795 --> 00:45:40,835
I ordered my ring to find you.

476
00:45:41,005 --> 00:45:44,085
I had to find a deserving one.

477
00:45:44,245 --> 00:45:47,165
A man entirely without fear.

478
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:53,245
A lot of people think I'm a coward
because of what happened in the war.

479
00:45:53,415 --> 00:45:55,005
Did your ring tell you about that?

480
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:58,245
You are no coward, Hal Jordan.

481
00:45:58,495 --> 00:46:01,585
To you, all life is precious.

482
00:46:01,755 --> 00:46:06,875
And this ring is far too powerful
to fall into the hands of someone...

483
00:46:07,045 --> 00:46:09,125
...who doesn't understand that.

484
00:46:27,415 --> 00:46:28,755
How does this thing work?

485
00:46:29,005 --> 00:46:31,705
The Guardians...

486
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:35,455
They will...

487
00:46:50,245 --> 00:46:51,965
Wow, you really do know him.

488
00:46:52,545 --> 00:46:53,625
And you must be Robin.

489
00:46:54,005 --> 00:46:55,835
I hear you're quite a detective.

490
00:46:56,205 --> 00:46:58,285
Well, I try not to brag, but...

491
00:46:58,455 --> 00:47:00,125
Have you finished your homework yet?

492
00:47:00,285 --> 00:47:02,795
Uh... Right.

493
00:47:05,795 --> 00:47:08,915
Hm. New look, a sidekick.

494
00:47:09,085 --> 00:47:11,835
- Do you mind if I ask...?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

495
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:15,665
Let's just say I set out to scare criminals,
not children.

496
00:47:16,045 --> 00:47:17,495
Fair enough.

497
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:22,005
This all lines up with dozens of stories
we've run in the Planet this year.

498
00:47:22,455 --> 00:47:25,455
The children's book
is particularly ominous.

499
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:28,285
As if someone, something else...

500
00:47:28,455 --> 00:47:30,165
...were speaking through the author.

501
00:47:30,335 --> 00:47:33,755
<i>In its wake. We have a live report</i>
<i>coming in from Cape Canaveral. </i>

502
00:47:33,915 --> 00:47:37,375
<i>The creature is hovering over</i>
<i>the large fuel tanks here at the Cape... </i>

503
00:47:37,545 --> 00:47:40,625
<i>... making it impossible for the Army</i>
<i>to use their missiles on it. </i>

504
00:47:40,795 --> 00:47:43,375
- Lois.
<i>- lts wingspan is easily the length... </i>

505
00:47:43,545 --> 00:47:44,705
<i>... of a football field... </i>

506
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:47,665
<i>... and it looks a lot like</i>
<i>a prehistoric pterodactyl. </i>

507
00:47:47,835 --> 00:47:49,795
<i>But much, much bigger. </i>

508
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:59,005
I'm not sure of what it's trying to do.

509
00:48:41,455 --> 00:48:43,205
Diana.

510
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:47,495
Haven't flown this thing in years.

511
00:48:47,915 --> 00:48:49,455
Guess I'm a little rusty.

512
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:51,045
Easy, easy.

513
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:55,625
We fought it, hard as we could, but...

514
00:48:58,755 --> 00:49:00,705
It's coming, Kal.

515
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:03,245
It's coming here.

516
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:09,125
Medic!

517
00:49:10,005 --> 00:49:12,795
We know this place could
never hold someone with your powers.

518
00:49:13,205 --> 00:49:16,625
- Why do you stay?
- I'm determined to beat you at this game.

519
00:49:16,795 --> 00:49:19,455
Without reading your mind.

520
00:49:19,795 --> 00:49:21,915
Come on, level with me.

521
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:24,335
Very well.

522
00:49:24,495 --> 00:49:28,585
I have looked into your mind,
and by extension, your heart.

523
00:49:28,755 --> 00:49:31,455
You honestly believe
that there will be a better day...

524
00:49:31,625 --> 00:49:33,455
...when all of this won't be necessary.

525
00:49:34,045 --> 00:49:39,335
To find that within you, Mr. Faraday,
has filled my heart with hope.

526
00:49:41,705 --> 00:49:44,965
And I have no place else to go.

527
00:49:47,835 --> 00:49:51,375
This just came in from Washington,
urgent.

528
00:49:52,495 --> 00:49:54,165
It's The Centre, isn't it?

529
00:49:54,335 --> 00:49:57,125
I can feel its presence very strongly now.

530
00:49:58,045 --> 00:49:59,795
You're looking for a place to go?

531
00:50:00,085 --> 00:50:02,165
I got one hell of a destination for you.

532
00:50:02,335 --> 00:50:03,625
But we might not come back.

533
00:50:04,545 --> 00:50:05,585
I'm ready.

534
00:50:07,545 --> 00:50:10,125
The last time I appeared
without warning in this form...

535
00:50:10,285 --> 00:50:11,585
...someone died of fright.

536
00:50:11,835 --> 00:50:14,665
Perhaps I should take a friendlier
appearance.

537
00:50:14,835 --> 00:50:16,665
Suit yourself.

538
00:50:19,495 --> 00:50:21,205
Well?

539
00:50:22,205 --> 00:50:25,795
It's okay. But real men wear pants.

540
00:50:34,875 --> 00:50:38,125
<i>This absolutely unprecedented</i>
<i>situation off the coast of Florlda. </i>

541
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,665
<i>The combined might</i>
<i>of the U.S. Armed Forces... </i>

542
00:50:40,835 --> 00:50:43,085
<i>...had no effect on this... </i>
- Bourbon, please.

543
00:50:43,245 --> 00:50:45,005
<i>I hardly know what to call it. </i>

544
00:50:45,165 --> 00:50:48,545
<i>lt appears we've reestablished contact</i>
<i>with our reporter at the scene. </i>

545
00:50:48,705 --> 00:50:53,625
<i>The only word I can find</i>
<i>to describe the scale of this is "biblical."</i>

546
00:50:53,795 --> 00:50:58,415
<i>lt's a living island, </i>
<i>at least 25 miles across. </i>

547
00:51:00,545 --> 00:51:05,005
<i>lt has large ports which</i>
<i>discharge intense blasts of energy... </i>

548
00:51:05,165 --> 00:51:09,245
<i>... but which can also draw things</i>
<i>into the creature. </i>

549
00:51:10,335 --> 00:51:15,585
<i>Not two minutes ago, we watched it inhale</i>
<i>an entire aircraft carrier. </i>

550
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:22,795
<i>The loss of life out here</i>
<i>is incalculable and... </i>

551
00:51:22,965 --> 00:51:27,375
<i>Wait. We're turning around. </i>
<i>We've been ordered back. </i>

552
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:29,085
I have to tell you something.

553
00:51:29,245 --> 00:51:31,335
- I'm the F...
I already know.

554
00:51:31,585 --> 00:51:33,245
You what?

555
00:51:35,415 --> 00:51:37,085
I'm a reporter, remember?

556
00:51:37,245 --> 00:51:40,495
I always suspected, and I heard your voice
on the news the other night.

557
00:51:40,665 --> 00:51:44,915
I was only trying to protect you.
They think I'm some kind of criminal.

558
00:51:45,165 --> 00:51:46,585
But we know better, don't we?

559
00:51:49,665 --> 00:51:51,085
So, what are you waiting for?

560
00:51:51,245 --> 00:51:55,005
You know who's going to be there?
Superman, Wonder Woman, people like that.

561
00:51:55,165 --> 00:51:58,335
I'm just a guy who runs
after jewelry thieves and talking gorillas.

562
00:51:58,495 --> 00:51:59,835
You're more than that.

563
00:52:00,005 --> 00:52:02,165
And you're going to prove it.

564
00:52:19,705 --> 00:52:21,125
What are you doing?

565
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:25,875
Where have you been?
And what happened to the simulator?

566
00:52:26,045 --> 00:52:27,165
Long story.

567
00:52:27,335 --> 00:52:30,005
Have you seen the news?
Do you have any idea what's...

568
00:52:31,965 --> 00:52:33,335
Oh, God.

569
00:52:33,495 --> 00:52:35,335
You're going down there, aren't you?

570
00:52:35,495 --> 00:52:38,795
Hal the pacifist is going down there
to get killed by that thing.

571
00:52:38,965 --> 00:52:40,375
What would you have me do?

572
00:52:40,545 --> 00:52:42,165
Or do you think I'm a coward too?

573
00:52:42,335 --> 00:52:44,335
I looked up your war record.

574
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,835
You never fired
at those North Korean planes.

575
00:52:47,005 --> 00:52:50,795
Maybe I just didn't believe that what
we were doing there was worth killing for.

576
00:52:50,965 --> 00:52:54,335
But in that trench,
I found out what would make me kill.

577
00:52:54,495 --> 00:52:58,625
Survival. I would kill to survive.

578
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:05,795
Aren't you going to at least say goodbye?

579
00:53:05,965 --> 00:53:07,625
Don't you...?

580
00:53:28,245 --> 00:53:30,125
Whoa. We're just here to help.

581
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:37,545
We don't need help.
Especially not from you.

582
00:53:38,585 --> 00:53:41,375
You think you can hit me?
It's been tried before.

583
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:43,545
Don't push us, mister.

584
00:53:52,165 --> 00:53:54,915
I see I have your attention.

585
00:53:55,335 --> 00:53:58,665
We face a threat big enough
to wipe us off the Earth...

586
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:02,665
...and still we bicker about a mask
or a uniform.

587
00:54:02,835 --> 00:54:05,705
My best friend is lying upstairs right now.

588
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:08,245
She would have given her life
for this country...

589
00:54:08,415 --> 00:54:12,205
...and I could hardly look her in the eye.
America was founded on the notion...

590
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:15,165
...that a person should be free
to follow his or her destiny.

591
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:18,545
But we can't do that if we're living in fear
of our own government.

592
00:54:18,835 --> 00:54:23,085
We need to reclaim this country
for free men and women everywhere.

593
00:54:23,245 --> 00:54:26,375
- What about your government friends?
That's a fair question.

594
00:54:26,915 --> 00:54:28,085
Superman's right.

595
00:54:28,245 --> 00:54:30,285
The persecution and paranoia
have to stop.

596
00:54:30,455 --> 00:54:34,795
From here on,
we work together as free Americans.

597
00:54:41,455 --> 00:54:44,545
I'm gonna fly out now
and recon this thing.

598
00:54:47,455 --> 00:54:50,415
When I get back,
we'll work out a strategy.

599
00:54:50,585 --> 00:54:51,625
Are you with me?

600
00:55:53,085 --> 00:55:56,545
<i>America's champion, Superman... </i>

601
00:55:56,705 --> 00:56:00,545
...went down in defeat several hours ago.

602
00:56:00,705 --> 00:56:05,205
An exhaustive search
has found no sign of him.

603
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:09,755
Here at the Cape,
the greatest minds in the free world...

604
00:56:09,915 --> 00:56:14,335
...are now working on a plan to stop
this monster...

605
00:56:14,495 --> 00:56:16,705
...before it reaches the coast.

606
00:56:17,085 --> 00:56:19,285
We cannot panic.

607
00:56:20,205 --> 00:56:25,005
We cannot let our sense of loss...

608
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,375
If this book's right...

609
00:56:36,545 --> 00:56:39,205
...it's a whole new life form
we've never even imagined.

610
00:56:40,245 --> 00:56:43,755
Or it could be nothing more than
the ravings of some demented cartoonist.

611
00:56:46,045 --> 00:56:49,085
It's not. I assure you.

612
00:56:49,245 --> 00:56:52,085
And there's only one way
to stop this thing now.

613
00:56:52,245 --> 00:56:54,005
I want you all to listen to this man.

614
00:56:54,165 --> 00:56:58,085
Gentlemen, I'm Ray Palmer
from lvy University.

615
00:56:58,245 --> 00:57:00,875
I've heard of you, Palmer,
and your invention.

616
00:57:01,045 --> 00:57:02,245
Matter reduction, right?

617
00:57:02,415 --> 00:57:04,755
- Right. I...
It won't work.

618
00:57:04,915 --> 00:57:07,165
Everything it shrinks becomes unstable.

619
00:57:07,335 --> 00:57:08,585
Exactly.

620
00:57:12,245 --> 00:57:14,165
We start with an all-out aerial assault.

621
00:57:14,335 --> 00:57:17,705
We hit the thing from every direction
at once. That's a distraction.

622
00:57:18,125 --> 00:57:20,875
While it's fighting the Air Corps,
we use this baby on it.

623
00:57:21,455 --> 00:57:24,625
This gizmo uses light to shrink things.

624
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:29,755
- Question...
- Wait.

625
00:57:29,915 --> 00:57:32,045
Everything the ray shrinks
becomes unstable.

626
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:37,125
Meaning, it explodes.

627
00:57:37,545 --> 00:57:38,585
Still have a question?

628
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:41,875
That thing out there is one
hell of a lot bigger than an orange.

629
00:57:42,045 --> 00:57:43,875
- How are you gonna...?
- It is big.

630
00:57:44,045 --> 00:57:47,375
And that's why we have to expose
its surface to the ray piece by piece.

631
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:51,165
All in the blink of an eye?
That's impossible without Superman.

632
00:57:51,335 --> 00:57:55,375
No, it's not impossible, is it?

633
00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:57,965
Piece of cake.

634
00:57:58,375 --> 00:57:59,625
Any other questions?

635
00:57:59,795 --> 00:58:01,335
Just one.
- Jordan.

636
00:58:01,495 --> 00:58:04,045
- About time.
- Attacking the surface won't be enough...

637
00:58:04,205 --> 00:58:05,495
...to distract this thing.

638
00:58:05,665 --> 00:58:08,545
You need someone
to go inside with bombs.

639
00:58:08,705 --> 00:58:10,585
- You volunteering?
- He'd better...

640
00:58:10,755 --> 00:58:12,965
...because I'm not going in there alone.

641
00:58:13,125 --> 00:58:15,125
Outstanding.

642
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,335
<i>All of you, remember... </i>

643
00:58:26,495 --> 00:58:29,165
<i>... today there are no Democrats, </i>
<i>no Republicans. </i>

644
00:58:29,335 --> 00:58:31,665
<i>No hawks, no doves. </i>

645
00:58:31,835 --> 00:58:34,705
<i>Just the naked simplicity of an absolute: </i>

646
00:58:34,915 --> 00:58:37,125
<i>Mankind's survival. </i>

647
00:58:37,665 --> 00:58:39,705
<i>Good luck to us all. </i>

648
00:59:11,165 --> 00:59:12,375
All right, men.

649
00:59:12,545 --> 00:59:16,005
Our job is to protect Flash until Morgan
and Jordan light it up.

650
00:59:16,165 --> 00:59:17,545
- I want...
Hey, look out!

651
01:01:03,495 --> 01:01:06,045
Hawk! Ah!

652
01:01:34,835 --> 01:01:40,205
- Are you all right?
- It's attacking my mind.

653
01:02:32,585 --> 01:02:34,755
All of you, fight on!

654
01:02:34,915 --> 01:02:37,665
To the last breath, fight on!

655
01:02:38,835 --> 01:02:40,415
All weapons systems hot.

656
01:02:40,585 --> 01:02:43,705
<i>Like they say, it ain't when you go, </i>
<i>it's how you go. </i>

657
01:03:17,625 --> 01:03:20,045
Uh, Hal?
What's wrong?

658
01:03:20,205 --> 01:03:21,835
Whatever you see, ignore it.

659
01:03:22,005 --> 01:03:24,085
Just keep going. Acknowledge.

660
01:03:26,205 --> 01:03:28,455
Just keep going. No problem.

661
01:03:37,495 --> 01:03:39,005
What now?

662
01:03:42,165 --> 01:03:45,495
This stuff is no hallucination,
I'll tell you that.

663
01:03:51,245 --> 01:03:53,835
And whatever it is,
I think it's trying to get inside.

664
01:03:57,585 --> 01:04:00,005
Drop the bombs,
then we'll burn our way out.

665
01:04:00,165 --> 01:04:01,285
Roger that.

666
01:04:07,915 --> 01:04:09,165
My rockets are dead.

667
01:04:09,335 --> 01:04:10,665
Can't open bomb bay doors.

668
01:04:10,835 --> 01:04:12,335
- Hal?
<i>- I'm here. </i>

669
01:04:12,495 --> 01:04:15,335
We've had our ride
and it's time to punch our ticket.

670
01:04:15,495 --> 01:04:17,495
<i>lnitiate manual detonation. </i>

671
01:04:17,665 --> 01:04:19,545
Roger.

672
01:04:28,625 --> 01:04:31,415
<i>Hal Jordan, you are the key. </i>

673
01:04:31,585 --> 01:04:33,795
<i>Your will drives the ring. </i>

674
01:04:33,965 --> 01:04:38,625
<i>Clear your mind</i>
<i>and focus on what matters. </i>

675
01:05:26,085 --> 01:05:28,045
Hal? What...?

676
01:05:28,205 --> 01:05:29,705
Later.

677
01:05:33,245 --> 01:05:34,585
You're afraid.

678
01:05:34,755 --> 01:05:36,415
It's all on me.

679
01:05:36,625 --> 01:05:37,965
The whole thing.

680
01:05:38,375 --> 01:05:40,335
We'll be there for you.

681
01:05:40,495 --> 01:05:42,455
We all will.

682
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:50,455
Godspeed.

683
01:06:38,705 --> 01:06:41,415
He did it. Son of a bitch.

684
01:06:52,585 --> 01:06:53,835
I was afraid...

685
01:06:54,005 --> 01:06:56,665
...I'd be late for the victory party.

686
01:07:01,875 --> 01:07:03,045
Spoke too soon.

687
01:07:14,205 --> 01:07:18,415
That thing's gonna do a lot of damage.
Guess it's time to see what this ring can do.

688
01:07:18,585 --> 01:07:19,625
Hey.

689
01:07:22,835 --> 01:07:24,285
Sorry.

690
01:07:33,755 --> 01:07:36,205
That guy with the ring,
he wasn't part of the plan.

691
01:07:36,375 --> 01:07:37,665
Or wasn't I listening?

692
01:07:41,665 --> 01:07:44,205
<i>You won't be able to do it. </i>

693
01:07:44,375 --> 01:07:47,545
<i>It is The Centre that holds, not you. </i>

694
01:07:47,875 --> 01:07:50,755
I can. I can.

695
01:07:51,045 --> 01:07:54,585
<i>You do not have the will. </i>

696
01:07:54,915 --> 01:07:56,085
No?

697
01:07:56,245 --> 01:07:57,915
Watch.

698
01:08:39,085 --> 01:08:41,455
Whoo-hoo!

699
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:53,965
Hey, Ace, what happened
to that buddy of yours?

700
01:08:54,125 --> 01:08:55,245
Hal Jordan?

701
01:08:55,415 --> 01:08:58,795
If I know him, he's up there somewhere
tear-assing around.

702
01:09:32,415 --> 01:09:34,585
I am Arthur of Atlantis.

703
01:09:34,755 --> 01:09:38,665
This one has been asking
for a woman named Lois.

704
01:10:05,045 --> 01:10:08,705
<i>The pioneers gave up their safety, </i>
<i>their comfort... </i>

705
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:13,245
<i>... and sometimes their lives</i>
<i>to build our new West. </i>

706
01:10:13,415 --> 01:10:18,005
<i>They were determined</i>
<i>to make the new world strong and free... </i>

707
01:10:18,165 --> 01:10:21,005
<i>... an example to the world. </i>

708
01:10:21,245 --> 01:10:24,915
<i>Some would say that those struggles</i>
<i>are all over. </i>

709
01:10:25,085 --> 01:10:27,705
<i>That all the horizons have been explored. </i>

710
01:10:27,875 --> 01:10:30,245
<i>That all the battles have been won. </i>

711
01:10:30,415 --> 01:10:33,965
<i>That there is no longer</i>
<i>an American frontier. </i>

712
01:10:35,915 --> 01:10:40,245
<i>And we stand today on the edge</i>
<i>of a new frontier. </i>

713
01:10:40,415 --> 01:10:44,835
<i>The frontier of unknown opportunities</i>
<i>and perils. </i>

714
01:10:45,005 --> 01:10:50,835
<i>Beyond that frontier are uncharted areas</i>
<i>of science and space. </i>

715
01:10:51,005 --> 01:10:53,835
<i>Unsolved problems of peace and war. </i>

716
01:10:54,005 --> 01:10:58,755
<i>Unconquered pockets</i>
<i>of ignorance and prejudice. </i>

717
01:11:00,085 --> 01:11:02,125
<i>I'm asking each of you... </i>

718
01:11:02,285 --> 01:11:05,755
<i>... to be pioneers</i>
<i>towards that new frontier. </i>

719
01:11:05,915 --> 01:11:10,335
<i>My call is to the young at heart, </i>
<i>regardless of age. </i>

720
01:11:10,495 --> 01:11:13,085
<i>Can we carry through in an age... </i>

721
01:11:13,245 --> 01:11:17,705
<i>... where we will witness not only new</i>
<i>breakthroughs in weapons of destruction... </i>

722
01:11:17,875 --> 01:11:21,205
<i>... but also a race for mastery</i>
<i>of the sky and the rain... </i>

723
01:11:21,375 --> 01:11:25,125
<i>... the ocean and the tides, </i>
<i>the far side of space... </i>

724
01:11:25,285 --> 01:11:28,125
<i>... and the inside of men's minds? </i>

725
01:11:29,005 --> 01:11:31,965
<i>All mankind waits upon our decision. </i>

726
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:36,795
<i>A whole world looks to see</i>
<i>what we shall do. </i>

727
01:11:37,285 --> 01:11:42,795
<i>And we cannot fail their trust. </i>
<i>And we cannot fail to try. </i>

I booked my flight.

- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

326
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,041
What's so urgent?

327
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,791
You want to retire?

328
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,208
Eh... <i>sí.</i>

329
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,291
No!

330
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:12,791
Don't do it.

Oh...

I booked my flight before this.

335
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,125
A coincidence...

336
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,541
There are no coincidences.

337
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,708

Yes, His Holiness is aware.

[Bergoglio] Yes!

[gardener] Bravo!

421
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,541
Everything the pope eats comes
from Gandolfo.

We send it to Rome. It's all organic.

Ah...

00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:05,916
[in Latin] Last time we met,
we spoke Latin.

[Bergoglio chuckles]

430
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,541
[in Latin] A short meeting.

431
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:13,291
I wasn't the student you were,
Holy Father.

432
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,166
Please, not Latin.

433
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,583
- [kisses hand]
- Ah.

434
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,416
[in English]
Ah, Latin is useful. Especially when...

435
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,875
I have to announce bad news to cardinals.

436
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,000
Only 20 percent of them... become angry

437
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,458
as only 20 percent of them know
what I have said.

438
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:30,791
[Bergoglio chuckles]

439
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,800
[Benedict]
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

440
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:35,166
I know you... value punctuality.

441
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,750
Uh, Paolo, my last assistant,

442
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,125
he would have made sure
I got here on time.

443
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:40,333
- He was, uh...
- [chuckles]

444
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:43,333
- He was perfect, you know? [chuckles]
- Now he's in jail.

445
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:45,916
Yeah.

446
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,541
Would you prefer to walk?

447
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:54,041
- Well, that might not be wise.
- Huh?

448
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,916
Your shoelaces are undone.

449
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,916
- [Bergoglio chuckles] Oh.
- [Benedict] Yeah.

450
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,166
[Bergoglio] Um...

451
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:01,916
[Benedict grunts]

452
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:07,875
You wrote to me asking for permission
to retire as cardinal archbishop?

453
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yes, uh...

454
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,250
I have my papers here.

455
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:16,291
Uh, cardinals are not required to ask
for their retirement until they're 75.

456
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:17,541
Are you ill?

457
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,309
- I have a problem with my lungs.
- [Benedict] I know,

458
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,851
but you were born with that,
and it's not really troubled you since,

459
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:23,875
has it?

460
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,500
It's in your file.

461
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:28,291
- [Bergoglio] My file?
- We keep files on everyone.

462
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,250
So you don't have to be flattered.

463
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,833
[Bergoglio] No, I, uh...

464
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,166
- I'm not ill.
- [Benedict] No.

465
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,916
In fact, you're very active.

466
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,875
You walk everywhere
and, uh, sometimes use a bicycle.

467
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,638
[Bergoglio] Yeah, and I tango once a week.

468
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:41,958
Tango is dance?

469
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,875
- [Bergoglio] I'm Argentinian.
- Oh.

470
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,875
Tango and football are compulsory.

471
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,416
Of course, yeah. You dance with someone?

472
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:51,416
Uh, I... One might look rather foolish
dancing alone.

473
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,333
[Benedict laughs]

474
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:55,833
So, for the sake of the dignity
of my office, yes, with someone.

475
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,958
Of course, that's good. Please.

476
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:05,166
- [sniffles, clicks tongue, sighs]
- Yes.

477
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,791
You've been one of my harshest critics,

478
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,208
and there's a lot of competition
for that title.

479
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,250
I've never spoken out against you.

480
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:14,750
No, not directly, but, um...

481
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,041
you refuse to live in the official palace
of the cardinal archbishops.

482
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,250
<i>Sí, </i>it's too grand. It's too big.

483
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,166
Ah... [chuckles]

484
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:26,208
By being so, um... pure and simple,

485
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:28,958
you imply the rest of us
are not living simply enough.

486
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:31,833
Can one ever...

487
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:34,583
- live simply enough?
- [chuckles softly]

488
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,250
On, uh... married priests.

489
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,083
I was misquoted.

490
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:43,458
I said, "Celibacy can be a blessing.
It can also be a curse."

491
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:44,958
Yeah. And on homosexuality?

492
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:46,625
All I said was...

493
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:49,916
- [Benedict] No doubt, misquoted again?
- [sighs] Taken out of context.

494
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,250
Aha... But might I suggest
you try telling the newspapers

495
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:54,875
the opposite of what you think?

496
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:58,208
Your chances of being quoted correctly
might, therefore, improve.

497
00:24:58,291 --> 00:24:59,333
[sniffles, chuckles]

498
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,750
Another thing: you openly give sacraments

499
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:04,583
to those who are out of communion.

500
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:06,166
To the divorced, for instance.

501
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,708
Oh, I believe
that giving communion is not a reward

502
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:12,666
for the virtuous,

503
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,833
it is food for the starving.

504
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:15,916
Ah.

505
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,166
So, what matters is what <i>you </i>believe,

506
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,490
but not what the Church has taught
for hundreds of years?

507
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:21,458
No, no, no.

508
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:25,041
Mark, chapter two, verse 17,
"I came to call sinners,"

509
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:27,833
as the Church has taught
for thousands of years.

510
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:29,208
If we do not draw a line...

511
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:30,916
Or build walls to separate...

512
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,041
You talk about walls
as if they are bad things.

513
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:35,500
- A house is built of walls. Strong walls.
- Ah...

514
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:37,666
Did Jesus build walls?

515
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:39,916
His face is a face of mercy.

516
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:42,541
The bigger the sinner,
the warmer the welcome.

517
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,375
Mercy is the dynamite
that blows down walls.

518
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,333
- Yeah.
- [fly buzzes]

519
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:50,791
You have an answer for everything,
don't you?

520
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:52,625
[watch beeps] <i>Don't stop now.</i>

521
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:54,916
<i>- Keep moving.</i>
- [Benedict] I have to walk. Let's go.

522
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,333
[watch beeps]

523
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:59,267
<i>- Don't stop now. Keep moving.</i>
- [Benedict] You're clever. Far too clever.

524
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,500
[watch] <i>Keep moving.</i>

525
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,333
[Benedict] You see my dilemma.

526
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:04,666
You're very eloquent, you're very popular.

527
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,333
If I allow you to resign,
it will look like a protest.

528
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,708
The Church being attacked from all sides,

529
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:12,250
why would you want to abandon her
to her enemies?

530
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:15,083
Does a shepherd run away
when the wolves appear?

531
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:16,666
I'm not running away.

532
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:20,083
I’ll take a parish.
I’ll be a good shepherd to its people.

533
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:22,666
Don't you understand?
You were almost elected pope.

534
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:25,166
If you resign,
it will look like a criticism.

535
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:28,583
The way you live is a criticism.
Your shoes are a criticism.

536
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:30,416
You don't like my shoes? [laughs]

537
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:33,875
[Benedict] Please, do not make a joke
of everything I say. Please.

538
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:37,166
It is dishonest and cynical.

539
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,090
Have enough respect to show me
your real anger.

540
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:42,125
Do you think the Church is failing?

541
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:45,791
- Well, we are losing people.
- And that is the fault of the Church?

542
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:49,416
Not of... of... Western relativism,
or permissiveness,

543
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,041
or what do they say now?
Oh, yes, "Anything goes."

544
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:55,083
Yeah.

545
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:00,041
You said the Church is narcissistic.

546
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:02,583
- Or was that another misquote?
- No, no, I did say that.

547
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,000
It seems to me that your Church...

548
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,000
<i>- My </i>Church?
- [Bergoglio] <i>Our</i> Church...

549
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,666
- Oh.
- ...is moving in directions

550
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,541
that I can no longer condone,

551
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:12,250
or... or not moving at all

552
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:14,833
when the time demands movement.

553
00:27:14,916 --> 00:27:16,596
- [fly buzzes]
- [Bergoglio] Holy Father...

554
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:19,083
I no longer wish to be a salesman.

555
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,291
- A salesman?
- [Bergoglio] It's a metaphor.

556
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:23,375
A salesman for a product.

557
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:24,291
A product?

558
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:27,041
A salesman for a product that I...
[scoffs]

559
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:31,583
- I cannot, in all conscience, endorse.
- That you don't believe in?

560
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,125
It seems to me
that we are no longer part of this world.

561
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:36,750
We don't belong to it.

562
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:38,041
We are not connected.

563
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:39,333
[sighs]

564
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,416
"A Church that marries
the spirit of the age..."

565
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,460
[Bergoglio] Yes,
"...will be widowed in the next."

566
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,791
- Yeah.
- [Bergoglio] I know.

567
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:48,166
[takes a deep breath] Holy Father...

568
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,170
When you were leader
of the Jesuits in Argentina,

569
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,208
you had all the books on Marxism removed
from the library.

570
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:56,125
And I made seminarians wear cassocks
all day,

571
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,583
even when they were working
in the vegetable garden.

572
00:27:58,666 --> 00:28:01,958
And I called civil marriage
for homosexuals the Devil's plan.

573
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:04,916
- [Benedict] You were not unlike me.
- No.

574
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:06,541
I changed.

575
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:09,041
- No, you compromised.
- [Bergoglio] No. No compromise.

576
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:11,333
- No, I changed.
- Com...

577
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,291
It's a different thing.

578
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:18,458
[clicks tongue, sighs]

579
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:23,875
[clicks tongue]

580
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:27,250
- [grunts]
- Fath...

581
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:28,625
[mutters]

582
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,250
Change is compromise.

583
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,500
[Bergoglio] Life...

584
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,291
the life He gave us,

585
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:38,875
is all change.

586
00:28:40,541 --> 00:28:42,708
You are the successor to San Pietro.

587
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,541
San Pietro was married.

588
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:48,541
Oh, thank you for letting me know.
I had no idea.

589
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:54,041
We didn't ask priests to be celibate
until the 12th century.

590
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:56,333
- Hm.
- Angels? [chuckles]

591
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:58,583
No mention before the fifth century,

592
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:00,916
and suddenly, angels are everywhere,

593
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,458
like... like pigeons.

594
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:05,333
Nothing is static in nature

595
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,208
or the universe,

596
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:08,625
not even God.

597
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:11,166
God does not change.

598
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,625
Yes, He does.

599
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:15,333
- He moves towards us.
- "I am the way, the truth, and the life."

600
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:17,666
Where should we find Him
if He's always moving?

601
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:19,666
On the journey?

602
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:20,958
[Benedict] Oh...

603
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,750
This is your ego talking.

604
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,208
You think you know better.

605
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:27,583
I'm Argentinian.

606
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:30,208
- How does an Argentinian kill himself?
- Ah?

607
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:33,458
He climbs to the top of his ego
and jumps off.

608
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:37,750
[sarcastically] Ha-ha-ha!

609
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:46,675
I'm not familiar
with this part of the garden.

610
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:47,833
Where are we?

611
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:49,833
[Bergoglio] Um...

612
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:52,583
Maybe this way, where there is some shade?

613
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:53,875
Oh, yeah.

614
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:58,500
Perhaps we'll find God over there,
on the journey. I'll introduce you to Him.

615
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:04,333
We defend 2,000 years of tradition,

616
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:06,625
but Cardinal Bergoglio, he knows better.

617
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:10,708
No, no. We have spent these last years
disciplining anyone

618
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:13,291
who disagrees with our line on divorce,

619
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:15,625
on birth control, on being gay.

620
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:18,375
While our planet was being destroyed,

621
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:21,416
while inequality grew like a cancer,

622
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:25,166
we worried about whether it was all right
to speak the Mass in Latin,

623
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:29,041
whether, uh, girls should be allowed
to be altar servers.

624
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,333
We built walls around us,
and all the time,

625
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:35,083
all the time, the real danger was inside,

626
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,458
inside with us.

627
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:38,041
[insects chirping]

628
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:39,750
What are you talking about?

629
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,708
[Bergoglio]
I think you know what I'm talking about.

630
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:45,375
We knew there were priests, bishops,

631
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:48,541
great men of the Church
who preyed on children.

632
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:50,708
- And what did we do?
- We are addressing this.

633
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:52,333
We heard their confession,

634
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:56,291
then moved them on to another parish
where they could start all over again.

635
00:30:57,125 --> 00:31:00,208
- We believed if they confessed...
- Oh, we believed it was better

636
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,250
if nine children suffered

637
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:05,625
than if nine million lost their faith
because of a scandal?

638
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:09,416
- No, of course not. That is grotesque.
- A bishop! A bishop said that to me!

639
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:11,875
Uh-huh, and how did you answer him?

640
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:14,458
I told him to remove the priest
from his ministry

641
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,500
and initiate a canonical trial.
Straight away.

642
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:22,833
I didn't believe a few magic words
from the priest

643
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:24,541
would make everything all right again.

644
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:27,083
Magic words?
Is that how you describe the sacrament?

645
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:29,500
Confession cleans the sinner's soul.

646
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:31,208
It does not help the victim.

647
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,583
Sin is a... a wound,

648
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:36,916
not a stain.

649
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,708
It needs to be healed, to be treated.

650
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:41,416
Forgiveness is not enough.

651
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:44,041
You say "we,"

652
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:46,184
- but you mean <i>I'm </i>the one to blame.
- [Bergoglio] No.

653
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:48,328
- Holy Father. Please.
- Your protest... Listen to me.

654
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,125
Your resignation is a protest
against the Holy See,

655
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:54,041
- and you're asking me to ratify it.
- No, no.

656
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:56,958
You say you no longer wish
to be cardinal archbishop.

657
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:59,791
I ask you, are you sure
you still wish to be a priest?

658
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:01,458
[insects chirping loudly]

659
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:13,458
I don't agree with anything you say.

660
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:20,625
[insects continue chirping]

661
00:32:45,541 --> 00:32:47,541
- Ah, thank you.
- You're welcome.

662
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:51,000
The Holy Father has retired now
until dinner.

663
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:53,208
- Uh-huh.
- I'm to show you to your room.

664
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:54,458
My room?

665
00:32:54,541 --> 00:32:55,541
Yes.

666
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:56,791
Come. Please.

667
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,250
But, uh...

668
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,333
[Bergoglio] <i>What about His Holiness?</i>

669
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,833
- [nun] The pope eats alone.
- Why?

670
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,375
[nun] He prefers it that way.

671
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:26,916
But he has arranged for you both
to eat the same meal.

672
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
[Bergoglio] Ah.

673
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:30,250
[nun] Just as his mother used to make it.

674
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:34,375
[Bergoglio sniffs] Oh.

675
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,625
- Huh?
- A typical Bavarian dish,

676
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:39,541
<i>Knödel mit Soße.</i>

677
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:40,666
[inhales deeply]

678
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:42,416
Well...

679
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:45,958
Yes, I know.

680
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,166
[both laugh]

681
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:54,250

- [engines continue revving on TV]
- [announcer continues speaking on TV]

683
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:08,833
After dinner, sometimes,
he comes here to relax.

684
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:09,958
[Bergoglio] Oh...

685
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:12,958
- It's beautiful, huh?
- [nun] Mm-hmm.

686
00:34:13,416 --> 00:34:14,416
Yeah.

687
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:18,291
[Bergoglio] Well, <i>Papa </i>John.

688
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:20,208
- [nun] Yeah.
- [Bergoglio sighs]

689
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:21,583
[sniffs]

690
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:24,333
<i>Se posso...</i>

691
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:25,416
<i>Certo.</i>

692
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:26,583
<i>Sì, grazie.</i>

693
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:30,903
[reporter speaking Italian on TV]

694
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:32,958
- [nun] <i>Arrivederci, eminenza.</i>
- Oh, <i>grazie.</i>

695
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:36,458
[announcer speaking Italian on TV]

696
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:42,166
[watch beeping, in English] <i>Bravo.
Well done.</i>

697
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:44,333
<i>You did 10,000 steps today.</i>

698
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,166
<i>- Congratulations.</i>
- [Benedict] Ah, my goal.

699
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,041
My doctor gave it to me.[chuckles]

700
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:52,416
He said, "You are in good shape for 86
but very bad shape for a human being."

701
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:54,458
I believe this was a joke.

702
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:56,333
[announcer shouts on TV]

703
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:58,041
- [Benedict] No, no, please.
- No, no.

704
00:34:58,125 --> 00:34:59,166
- [Benedict] No, no.
- No.

705
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:00,250
- [Benedict] Please.
- No.

706
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:01,976
- I know you love football.
- [Bergoglio] No.

707
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,166
- [TV clicks off]
- Oh.

708
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,458
I've never understood
the excitement myself.

709
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:08,583
Really? Not even during the World Cup?
Huh?

710
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,583
You know, your national team and mine,
we...

711
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:14,333
we could be in the final together
next year.

712
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:16,875
They could be a match for Argentina.

713
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:18,291
[exhales] Yeah. That's good.

714
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:20,875
[smacks lips]

715
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:23,291
[chuckles softly]

716
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:25,291
[Benedict] Hm...

717
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,208
Please sit. Uh.

718
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:30,625
Holy Father...

719
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,041
- I want you to look at my papers, please.
- No, no, no...

720
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:37,851
- No, this is... But my papers, I really...
- No, no, no, no, no, please.

721
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:38,791
[Bergoglio] Please, no,

722
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:41,041
- this is the reason I'm here.
<i>- Nein.</i>

723
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,791
I know you like to talk,
but I'm exhausted.

724
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,708
- [sighs]
- [Benedict] Please, sit down.

725
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:48,958
Let's just be quiet together. Please sit.

726
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:50,833
Good.

727
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:54,625
[both exhale]

728
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,791
- [Benedict] Get so tired.
- Hm.

729
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:57,708
[Benedict] Ah.

730
00:35:57,791 --> 00:35:59,751
- Would you like a tea or coffee?
- No, thank you.

731
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:03,875
I find if I drink coffee
too late at night, I can't sleep.

732
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:05,416
[Benedict] Hm. Me too.

733
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,750
[Bergoglio] Hm.

734
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:12,083
[sighs]

735
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:14,958
Ah.

736
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,791
[clock ticking]

737
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:32,583
You know,
the hardest thing is to listen...

738
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,500
to hear His voice.

739
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:39,333
God's voice.

740
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:43,708
Sorry, even for a pope?

741
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:46,458
But perhaps especially for a pope.

742
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:50,125
[chuckles, coughing]

743
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,708
You know, when I was a young man,
hundreds of years ago,

744
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,458
I always knew what He wanted of me.
What God wanted, what...

745
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:02,750
purpose He had for me.

746
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:05,541
But now...

747
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,750
I don't know.

748
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:14,541
[sniffles]
Perhaps I need to listen more intently.

749
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:16,875
What do you think, Cardinal Bergoglio?

750
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,416
- What? Uh, hmm...
- [Benedict grunts]

751
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:22,833
[chuckles]

752
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,500
Yeah.

753
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:29,333
I think, perhaps, I need a...

754
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:31,875
a spiritual hearing aid.

755
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:35,625
Who does know?

756
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:41,333
You know, when I first heard that voice,
whatever that was...

757
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:43,875
His voice, God's voice...

758
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:47,250
[smacks lips, inhales sharply]

759
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:48,583
...it brought me peace.

760
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:51,625
Such peace.

761
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:54,791
[sniffles] Ha!

762
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,458
You must have felt that?

Hmm. The call, yes.

766
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
The peace...

767
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:10,291
<i>I wouldn't call it peace.</i>

Jorge, these results are the same.

[young Bergoglio] Yes, same experiment.

[woman] What did we agree on?

794

Hmm?

795
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:33,875
We have to test, test, and test.

Facts are...

798
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,166
You've had a haircut.

799
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,458
[young Bergoglio] That is a fact.

800
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:45,958
[woman] And that shirt is new.

801
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:47,750
[chuckles softly]

802
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:49,791
Also a fact.

803
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,666
You've decided?

804
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:56,125
You will propose!

805
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:58,416
That's speculation.

806
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,250
No, a deduction.

807
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:02,375
[young Bergoglio] An incorrect deduction.

808
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,833
I already asked.

809
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:08,666
Tonight we'll discuss the details.

810
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:11,250
So, you won't be a priest.

811
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:14,458
[young Bergoglio] A logical conclusion,
Esther.

812
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:16,750
What took you so long?

813
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:18,333
[young Bergoglio] <i>Bueno...</i>

814
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,791
I had to listen to...

815
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:23,458
you know,

816
00:40:23,541 --> 00:40:25,291
if He had other plans for me.

817
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
[Esther] He?

818
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:30,625
- [young Bergoglio] <i>He.</i>
- Ah.

819
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:34,333
This country doesn't need another priest.

820
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,291
I'll redo the tests.

821
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:39,583
- Next time, don't fool me.
- [young Bergoglio] Promise.

822
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,250
[Esther] Jorge!

823
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:44,166
You're going to be a great father.

824
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,250
[chuckles]

825
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:52,125
[woman] You're beautiful!

826
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:54,083
The prettiest ones.

827
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:55,875
How do I look?

828
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:56,875
Very handsome!

829
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:57,958
<i>Bueno, muchas gracias.</i>

830
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:00,041
[indistinct chatter]

831
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,125
[saxophone playing in distance]

832
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:17,958
[saxophone continues playing]

833
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,333
[distant clattering]

834
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,208
[door squeaks]

835
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:48,333
[man] Come in.

836
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:02,625
Come in.

837
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:06,916
No, Father, I was just passing.

838
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,458
[priest speaking Spanish]

839
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:14,000
[confessional door clicks closed]

840
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:19,833
[young Bergoglio]<i> Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.</i>

841
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:22,375
[priest] <i>I'm listening, my son.</i>

842
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:24,791
Before we start, may I ask you something?

843
00:42:26,208 --> 00:42:28,541
I haven’t seen you around.
Where are you from?

844
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,583
[priest] Parque Patricios.

845
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:34,125
Sometimes I come here to give Mass.

846
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:37,666
I'm praying
you’re not a Huracán supporter.

847
00:42:38,583 --> 00:42:39,750
[chuckles]

848
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:41,750
Your prayers have been answered.

849
00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:47,208
I live close by
in the priests’ home for the sick.

850
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:48,125
[young Bergoglio] Ah.

851
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:49,458
You tend to the sick.

852
00:42:50,125 --> 00:42:52,291
No. I'm one of them.

853
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:54,125
I have cancer.

854
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:56,458
Leukemia.

855
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:01,046
[young Bergoglio] Then why are you here,
Father?

856
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:04,333
I woke up this morning,

857
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:07,250
the Lord asked me to hear confession.

858
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:08,583
But no one came...

859
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:11,125
until you.

860
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:16,541
What is troubling you?

861
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:20,333
I'm listening, son.

862
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:23,125
Some time ago, I asked for a sign.

863
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:25,458
[priest] Perhaps...

864
00:43:26,041 --> 00:43:27,666
He's giving it now.

865
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:34,166
Maybe He wanted me here
to speak with you.

866
00:43:37,083 --> 00:43:38,458
[young Bergoglio] With me?

867
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:40,666
[priest] <i>Sí.</i>

868
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:46,291
Now you know our Father is watching.

869
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,625
You can confess.

870
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:51,791
Free your heart.

871
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:54,833
[wind blowing]

872
00:44:09,791 --> 00:44:11,791
[silently mouthing]

873
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:27,916
[bells ringing]

874
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:31,875
- [priest] Bergoglio.
- <i>Gracias.</i>

875
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,500
- [speaks Spanish]
<i>- Gracias.</i>

876
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:46,458
[both continue speaking Spanish]

877
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:52,083
- Bergoglio.
- [young Bergoglio] Yes.

878
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:55,000
- Welcome home.
- Thank you.

879
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:56,958
- How are you?
- Good.

880
00:44:57,083 --> 00:44:58,291
[speaks Spanish]

881
00:44:58,583 --> 00:45:01,083
Do you know what you're saying no to?

882
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:02,666
- Yes.
- Yes?

883
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:04,791
She even has a name.

884
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:06,625
Oh, well.

885
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:10,291
You will have to learn to love her
in another way.

886
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:11,208
Hm?

887
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,791
Love has many faces.

888
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:14,291
[speaking Spanish]

889
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:17,958
It's a big mistake to think
one can live without love.

890
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:20,375
I still have San Lorenzo.

891
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,875
[Bergoglio, in English] <i>I can see now
there was never an alternative.</i>

892
00:45:23,958 --> 00:45:26,625
<i>That priest, that day,
me finding him there.</i>

893
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,541
[sighs] Even if I'd passed by,

894
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:32,625
God would have found
another way to call me.

895
00:45:33,041 --> 00:45:34,666
You have such certainty.

896
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
[Bergoglio] Yes.

897
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:39,458
And I'm certain... He wants me to retire.

898
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:40,750
[Benedict] No, please.

899
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:43,000
I know we have our differences,
our disagreements,

900
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:44,291
but, please, this evening,

901
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:48,083
let's be... simply brothers together,
shall we?

902
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,375
Hm? [chuckles]

903
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:53,833
Do you play the piano or any instrument?

904
00:45:53,916 --> 00:45:55,541
No. No, but I know you do.

905
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,375
You, uh... you made an album.

906
00:45:58,916 --> 00:46:01,583
Uh, <i>Music from the Vatican: Alma Mater.</i>

907
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:05,208
That's right, I did. Heh.
Have you a copy of the album?

908
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:07,583
[Bergoglio] Oh, yes, yes. <i>Por supuesto.</i>

909
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:10,875
Ah. I could sign it for you.

910
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:13,791
Yes, please.

911
00:46:15,416 --> 00:46:18,125
Perhaps you could play something now.

912
00:46:19,708 --> 00:46:22,166
Well, I...
I'm a bit out of practice, but...

913
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:25,083
let's see, I'll try. [sighs]

914
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,916
Now, this little piece by Bedřich Smetana,
my favorite Czech,

915
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,166
and, uh, it's a lullaby.

916
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:34,708
[chuckles] Let's see what I can do.

917
00:46:37,708 --> 00:46:39,708
[playing gentle melody]

918
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:43,041
[hits wrong note]

919
00:46:43,125 --> 00:46:44,485
[Benedict] He lived a tragic life.

920
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:45,958
- Ah.
- [Benedict] Yeah, well.

921
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:47,708
Anyway, so... [clears throat]

922
00:46:50,916 --> 00:46:52,916
[continues playing gentle melody]

923
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:29,208
[piano playing continues]

924
00:47:44,416 --> 00:47:45,656
[Benedict] You know, the, um...

925
00:47:46,791 --> 00:47:49,916
this album was recorded
in a... a famous studio in London.

926
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,833
[clears throat]
I was told, uh, I should be very honored

927
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:54,458
because the Beatles had been there.

928
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:56,267
- Do you know the Beatles?
- [Bergoglio] Yes,

929
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:59,208
- I know who they are. [chuckles]
- Of course you do. [chuckles]

930
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:00,750
[Bergoglio] "Eleanor Rigby."

931
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:02,708
- Who?
- [Bergoglio] "Eleanor Rigby."

932
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:05,566
- I don't know her.
- [Bergoglio] You know, <i>Yellow Submarine.</i>

933
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:09,250
- [Benedict] Sorry, I don't know who she...
- The album, <i>Yellow Submarine.</i>

934
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:10,375
[hums tune]

935
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:13,166
<i>- Yellow Submarine? </i>That's silly.
- [both chuckle]

936
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:15,666
- It's very funny.
- [Bergoglio chuckles]

937
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:18,541
Um...
Yes, I... I can't remember where the...

938
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,750
studio was, it was a...

939
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:23,000
But, uh,
it was like a church or something.

940
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:24,208
[Bergoglio] Abbey Road.

941
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:28,083
- Abbey, the Abbey? Yes, the road.
- Abbey Road. You went to Abbey Road?

942
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:30,750
No, no, no.
It would not have been appropriate.

943
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:32,958
[piano playing]

944
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:35,291
[Benedict] <i>But, you know,</i>

945
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,750
I once thought
I had a calling for music, but, uh...

946
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:39,958
I'm afraid, um...

947
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:42,458
at the keyboard, I'm not infallible.

948
00:48:42,958 --> 00:48:44,291
But I enjoy it.

949
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:46,500
[playing upbeat melody]

950
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:51,083
[chuckles]

951
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,500
You like?

952
00:48:54,708 --> 00:48:56,125
It's... very different.

953
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:57,875
It's wonderful.

954
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:03,208
[Benedict] It's an old, um...
uh, Berlin cabaret song.

955
00:49:03,291 --> 00:49:05,541
It was made famous on the radio
before the war

956
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:08,125
- by a singer called Zarah Leander.
- [Bergoglio] Ah.

957
00:49:08,208 --> 00:49:10,416
[Benedict] She was very pretty.
I was a big fan of hers.

958
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,260
- Sorry, who was?

the two seminarians who...

No. They should resist the temp...

997
00:51:11,375 --> 00:51:13,458
Well, yeah, yeah. So, the first one,

998
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:16,041
he goes to his spiritual director,
and he says,

999
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:20,500
"Father, is it permitted to smoke
while praying?"

1000
00:51:20,833 --> 00:51:23,583
And the director says,
"No. No, of course not."

1001

- Of course not. No, it's...
- No, no. So...

1002
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:27,708
So, the second one, he was a Jesuit.

1003
00:51:27,791 --> 00:51:32,958
He says to his friend, "Brother,
you're just asking the wrong question."

1004
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:35,208
- Ah.
- So he goes to the director,

1005
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:38,250
then he says,
"Father, is it permitted to pray

1007

00:58:55,916 --> 00:58:56,958
[door opens]

1116
00:58:59,541 --> 00:59:01,750
[in Italian] Holy Father, he's not there.

1117
00:59:01,833 --> 00:59:02,833
[Benedict] Ah.

1118
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:04,541
What do you mean?

1119
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:08,333
[man] We cannot find him.
I sent a car, but he's not there.

1120
00:59:10,083 --> 00:59:11,083
Find him!

1121
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:16,875
[indistinct chatter]

1122
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:21,250
[bell ringing]

1123
00:59:22,916 --> 00:59:25,583
[in English] I always wondered,
the uniform,

1124
00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:27,291
it must be very uncomfortable, huh?

1125
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:28,375
Very hot.

1126
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:31,291
Difficult to keep clean. [chuckles]

1127
00:59:35,208 --> 00:59:37,750
Or perhaps someone cleans it for you?

1128
00:59:39,708 --> 00:59:42,333
[sighs] This is where we're meeting?

1129
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,541
[guard]
I was just asked to bring you here.

1130
00:59:44,625 --> 00:59:45,666
[door opens]

1131
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:54,791
<i>Grazie.</i>

1132
00:59:56,625 --> 00:59:57,833
[sighs]

1133
01:00:27,083 --> 01:00:28,875
[jazz saxophone music playing]

1134
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,500
[organ and saxophone music playing]

1135
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:09,333
[Benedict]
You know, I've never been in here before.

1136
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,625
- [chuckles]
- When it was empty, I mean.

1137
01:01:12,708 --> 01:01:13,708
No, uh...

1138
01:01:14,666 --> 01:01:15,958
visitors, no tourists.

1139
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:17,916
[chuckles] I...

1140
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:22,333
- wanted to experience the moment with you.
- [both chuckle softly]

1141
01:01:22,833 --> 01:01:23,833
Ah, <i>Padre.</i>

1142
01:01:24,333 --> 01:01:27,291
- Yeah.
- If I was pope, I'd be in here every day.

1143
01:01:27,541 --> 01:01:29,291
- Yeah, what else?
- What?

1144
01:01:29,958 --> 01:01:32,500
Well, if you had been chosen,
what would you do?

1145
01:01:32,583 --> 01:01:33,726
- Holy Father.
- [Benedict] No.

1146
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:35,470
This place would be different,
I think. Huh?

1147
01:01:36,958 --> 01:01:40,666
- Well, I wouldn't eat alone, for a start.
- [Benedict] No?

1148
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:42,333
Aside from the theology,

1149
01:01:42,416 --> 01:01:44,000
- it's no good for you.
- Oh.

1150
01:01:44,166 --> 01:01:47,125
You know,
Jesus was always breaking bread

1151
01:01:47,208 --> 01:01:49,500
- and feeding people.
- Well, what else?

1152
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:52,000
Well, I'd, uh...

1153
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,625
I'd sort out the Bank.

1154
01:01:53,875 --> 01:01:56,958
[chuckles] Oh, good luck with that.

1155
01:01:57,041 --> 01:02:00,250
Yeah, well,
the banks almost destroyed my country.

1156
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:01,291
Yeah.

1157
01:02:01,375 --> 01:02:03,208
You know, they beg for deregulation,

1158
01:02:03,291 --> 01:02:05,750
like tigers begging
to be let out of a cage.

1159
01:02:05,875 --> 01:02:08,333
- [Benedict] Yeah.
- They devour everything in sight.

1160
01:02:08,416 --> 01:02:09,416
[Benedict] Yeah.

1161
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:11,041
It's new elitism.

1162
01:02:11,125 --> 01:02:12,125
Hm.

1163
01:02:12,958 --> 01:02:13,958
[Benedict] Yeah.

1164
01:02:15,666 --> 01:02:18,000
You're beginning to be happy
I'm going to retire.

1165
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:20,750
[chuckles] You, um...

1166
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,125
For many weeks now, I've been...

1167
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:27,000
well, I've been praying for a sign.

1168
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:29,541
I don't understand.

1169
01:02:31,541 --> 01:02:33,250
[sighs] Well, when your...

1170
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:38,000
when your request came to me
to retire as cardinal archbishop,

1171
01:02:38,083 --> 01:02:40,083
I could not accept it, your retirement,

1172
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:41,666
I mean, until I'd, um...

1173
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:43,750
spoken to you.

1174
01:02:44,958 --> 01:02:48,000
So, you had to come from Argentina to Rome
to see me.

1175
01:02:48,666 --> 01:02:49,666
And, uh...

1176
01:02:50,291 --> 01:02:51,375
what I'm saying is,

1177
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:53,625
perhaps you had to come here
for some other purpose.

1178
01:02:54,083 --> 01:02:55,083
Like what?

1179
01:02:56,208 --> 01:02:57,208
Well...

1180
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:00,541
you see, I've made a...

1181
01:03:01,416 --> 01:03:03,541
a decision, an important decision,
I think,

1182
01:03:03,625 --> 01:03:05,875
for the life of the Church
and for her future.

1183
01:03:06,541 --> 01:03:09,500
Something I ask you to hide in your soul
and speak of to no one.

1184
01:03:09,583 --> 01:03:10,916
- Uh-huh.
- Know what I mean?

1185
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
<i>- Sí.</i>
- Good.

1186
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:15,708
You know, sometimes...

1187
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:20,583
sometimes, you notice little things.
It's very strange.

1188
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:28,375
You know, the other night,
after... prayer,

1189
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:30,458
I put out the candle, and uh...

1190
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:35,208
instead of rising up...

1191
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:37,541
the smoke went down,

1192
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:40,291
like Cain's offering being rejected

1193
01:03:40,375 --> 01:03:41,615
- by God.
- [Bergoglio chuckles]

1194
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:43,500
Do you notice such things?

1195
01:03:45,583 --> 01:03:46,583
Uh...

1196
01:03:47,166 --> 01:03:52,416
I bought my ticket for my flight here...
[chuckles]

1197
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,791
<i>...before </i>you requested my presence.

1198
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,500
- No.
- Yes!

1199
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:00,023
- Your plane ticket, you bought it before?
- [Bergoglio] Yeah.

1200
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:02,041
[chuckles]

1201
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:05,083
[Benedict]
Well, that gives me great encouragement.

1202
01:04:07,458 --> 01:04:08,458
Yeah...

1203
01:04:09,916 --> 01:04:12,208
You're the right person.
I'm going to resign.

1204
01:04:12,291 --> 01:04:13,726
- This marble is cold here.
- Sorry...

1205
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,333
- [stammers]...the right person for what?
- To tell.

1206
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:18,375
To tell what?

1207
01:04:18,875 --> 01:04:20,916
What I just said. I'm going to resign.

1208
01:04:22,375 --> 01:04:24,041
Uh, resign from what?

1209
01:04:24,416 --> 01:04:26,166
[chuckles] The Papacy.

1210
01:04:26,375 --> 01:04:27,625
The Chair of Saint Peter.

1211
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:29,208
The Bishopric of Rome.

1212
01:04:29,291 --> 01:04:32,291
I'm going to renounce all of them.
[grunts]

1213
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:38,125
[Bergoglio] But you can't. You... You...
[clears throat]

1214
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:40,833
- You wouldn't be the pope anymore.
- [Benedict] No.

1215
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:44,291
Popes can't resign!

1216
01:04:44,791 --> 01:04:46,208
It's not without precedent.

1217
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:50,000
Celestine V resigned, 1294.

1218
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:51,666
Didn't you know that?

1219
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:54,708
Holy Father, you think...
you think people will not be shocked

1220
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:58,208
because this happened
once before, 700 years ago?

1221
01:04:58,291 --> 01:04:59,750
[Benedict chuckles] Well...

1222
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:03,708
I... I came here just to have you sign
a piece of paper.

1223
01:05:03,791 --> 01:05:04,791
[Benedict] I know.

1224
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:07,833
[groans, sighs]

1225
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:11,750
Now you know why I could not grant you
your wish to retire.

1226
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:14,458
It would be another conclave.
It is important that you're there.

1227
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:17,250
Holy Father, you must not do this.
You cannot do this.

1228
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:19,000
- [Benedict] Why not?
- [sighs]

1229
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:23,875
Why do the presidents of America
and Russia and China come to you?

1230
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:24,958
Because...

1231
01:05:25,791 --> 01:05:27,041
unlike them,

1232
01:05:27,125 --> 01:05:30,833
your authority comes from the fact
that you will suffer and die

1233
01:05:30,916 --> 01:05:32,208
in the job.

1234
01:05:33,125 --> 01:05:34,285
- Yeah.
- [Bergoglio] A martyr

1235
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:35,541
to justice and truth.

1236
01:05:35,916 --> 01:05:37,333
For this, all people come.

1237
01:05:37,416 --> 01:05:38,708
Forgive me, but...

1238
01:05:42,208 --> 01:05:43,208
But?

1239
01:05:43,583 --> 01:05:46,666
Christ did not come down from the cross.

1240
01:05:46,791 --> 01:05:49,791
Ah! God always grants you the right words.

1241
01:05:49,875 --> 01:05:52,333
[Bergoglio] No, no.
No, a pope must go on forever.

1242
01:05:52,416 --> 01:05:55,541
Be the personification
of the crucified Christ.

1243
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:59,708
If you do this,
you will damage the Papacy forever.

1244
01:05:59,791 --> 01:06:01,166
[Benedict tuts] Well...

1245
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,916
And what damage will I do if I remain?

1246
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:10,708
[sighs] I...

1247
01:06:12,083 --> 01:06:14,250
It's... It's... two popes?

1248
01:06:14,625 --> 01:06:17,208
- [Benedict] Well, in 19...
- No. It is... No, it's unthinkable.

1249
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:19,041
Well, in 1978, we had three popes.

1250
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:21,165
[Bergoglio] Yeah,
but they weren't at the same time.

1251
01:06:21,208 --> 01:06:22,791
I was making a little joke.

1252
01:06:23,125 --> 01:06:24,125
[Bergoglio] A joke?

1253
01:06:24,166 --> 01:06:26,541
A German joke.
It doesn't have to be funny.

1254
01:06:27,541 --> 01:06:28,541
[scoffs]

1255
01:06:29,125 --> 01:06:32,416
[Benedict] You know, there's a saying,
uh, "God always...

1256
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,916
corrects one pope by presenting the world
with another pope."

1257
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,166
I should... I'd like to see my correction.

1258
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:41,916
[takes a deep breath]
Both commanding authority.

1259
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
[Benedict] No.

1260
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:44,958
Only one would command authority.

1261
01:06:45,208 --> 01:06:47,458
I would, uh,
hide away, out of the spotlight.

1262
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:50,000
[in Latin] Silence incarnate!

1263
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:52,083
[chuckles]

1264
01:06:52,166 --> 01:06:54,583
[in English]
Are you being pressured to go? The Curia?

1265
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:55,833
No, no, no.

1266
01:06:55,916 --> 01:06:58,333
If there was pressure from there,
I would resist.

1267
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:01,166
No, I know my intentions
and my motives are pure.

1268
01:07:02,666 --> 01:07:05,958
- See, I'm a scholar, not a manager.
<i>- </i>[watch beeps] <i>Don't stop now.</i>

1269
01:07:06,041 --> 01:07:07,125
<i>- Keep moving.</i>
- Yeah.

1270
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:08,750

[chuckles]
I can no longer see out of my left eye.

1275
01:07:20,791 --> 01:07:21,791
And, uh...

1276
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:24,875
governance requires eyes
that I do not have.

1277
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:26,833
Yes...

1278
01:07:28,208 --> 01:07:30,166
I've struggled and fought to do what...

1279
01:07:31,125 --> 01:07:34,458
must be done, but, um... [clicks tongue]

1280
01:07:36,041 --> 01:07:37,750
- I've lost.
- [sighs]

1281
01:07:38,083 --> 01:07:41,291
It is our weakness
that calls forth the grace of God.

1282
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:44,625
You show your weakness,
He gives us strength.

1283
01:07:44,958 --> 01:07:45,958
[Benedict] Yeah.

1284
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:48,333
I've given you my answer.

1285
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:49,750
Be satisfied.

1286
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,166
With respect, Holy Father...

1287
01:07:53,166 --> 01:07:55,875
it's not me who needs to be satisfied.

1288
01:07:56,125 --> 01:07:59,416
It's 1.2 billion believers.

1289
01:07:59,833 --> 01:08:01,083
They'll need to know why.

1290
01:08:01,291 --> 01:08:04,708
Otherwise, they'll think
there is a scandal, a... a plot.

1291
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:07,250
Well,
that is the calculation of leadership.

1292
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,750
- [sighs]
- A calculation we must both make.

1293
01:08:10,958 --> 01:08:12,208
Both? Why?

1294
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:16,375
Well, for months,
I've been, uh, wanting to resign,

1295
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:19,125
but there was one thought
that prevented me from that.

1296
01:08:19,208 --> 01:08:21,541
I thought, "What if at the next conclave,

1297
01:08:21,791 --> 01:08:24,833
they voted for that, uh,
Cardinal Bergoglio?"

1298
01:08:24,916 --> 01:08:25,916
For you.

1299
01:08:26,291 --> 01:08:28,000
[Bergoglio]
Then I offered my resignation.

1300
01:08:28,083 --> 01:08:28,916
[Benedict] Exactly.

1301
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,375
[chuckles] I was delighted.

1302
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:32,041
As I said...

1303
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:34,625
what prevented me from resigning

1304
01:08:34,708 --> 01:08:36,000
was the thought that, uh,

1305
01:08:36,583 --> 01:08:39,041
they could've chosen you, or elected you.

1306
01:08:39,875 --> 01:08:42,333
But now you are here in Rome to see me,

1307
01:08:42,916 --> 01:08:44,958
- and now, I've changed.
- You've compromised.

1308
01:08:45,041 --> 01:08:46,250
No, I've changed.

1309
01:08:47,125 --> 01:08:48,583
Compromise is something else.

1310
01:08:49,916 --> 01:08:53,458
Your style and your methods
are entirely different to mine.

1311
01:08:53,708 --> 01:08:55,041
I don't agree with any...

1312
01:08:55,125 --> 01:08:58,000
well, most of the things you say,
think, or do, but, uh...

1313
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:00,833
for some strange reason,

1314
01:09:01,541 --> 01:09:02,666
now I can see a...

1315
01:09:04,583 --> 01:09:06,416
a necessity for a Bergoglio.

1316
01:09:07,541 --> 01:09:10,625
But I cannot do this without knowing
that there is, at least,

1317
01:09:10,708 --> 01:09:12,833
- a possibility that you might be chosen.
- No.

1318
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:16,541
It could never be me.

1319
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:17,458
All right.

1320
01:09:17,541 --> 01:09:19,125
- We are at an impasse.
- [sighs]

1321
01:09:19,208 --> 01:09:22,583
You cannot retire from the Church
unless I agree to your going,

1322
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:25,208
and I cannot resign
until you agree to stay.

1323
01:09:26,125 --> 01:09:28,041
It's a conundrum. A theological conundrum.

1324
01:09:28,125 --> 01:09:30,583
You don't understand.
It could never be me.

1325
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:33,041
We know in our heart of hearts
that it could be.

1326
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:36,041
The Church needs to change,
and you could be that change.

1327
01:09:36,125 --> 01:09:39,833
[sighs] Oh. No. No, uh...
Not me. Never.

1328
01:09:39,916 --> 01:09:41,750
- It couldn't be me.
- [Benedict] Why not?

1329
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:43,166

I've read your files.

1333
01:09:54,375 --> 01:09:55,416
[clicks tongue] No.

1334
01:09:56,666 --> 01:09:59,208
The files... are incomplete.

1335
01:09:59,625 --> 01:10:00,833

in the admiral's palace...

1427
01:14:13,541 --> 01:14:14,541
making contacts.

1428
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:16,125
Right?

1429
01:14:20,708 --> 01:14:24,041
[Bergoglio, in English] <i>In this moment,
she looked at me like I was a stranger.</i>

1430
01:14:28,166 --> 01:14:29,333
[car engine starts]

1431
01:14:32,583 --> 01:14:33,875
[Bergoglio] <i>With fear.</i>

1432
01:14:37,458 --> 01:14:39,833
That was the last time I ever saw her.

1433
01:14:42,375 --> 01:14:43,708
<i>She warned me,</i>

1434
01:14:43,791 --> 01:14:45,416
<i>- and I didn't listen.</i>
- [man shouting]

1435
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:48,100
- [men speaking Spanish]
<i>- </i>[Bergoglio, in English] <i>Had I listened,</i>

1436
01:14:48,166 --> 01:14:50,375
<i>I would not have made
the mistakes that I made.</i>

1437
01:14:50,458 --> 01:14:52,458
[all speaking Spanish]

1438
01:14:55,208 --> 01:14:56,517
[Jalics, in Spanish] I was his teacher.

1439
01:14:56,541 --> 01:14:59,083
Now he's head of the Jesuits
in Argentina.

1440
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,125
And Uruguay.

1441
01:15:01,208 --> 01:15:03,541
These are the guys learning skills.

1442
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,833
Come meet the boys I mentioned.

1443
01:15:05,916 --> 01:15:06,916
[speaking Spanish]

1444
01:15:06,958 --> 01:15:08,500
[Jalics] They're real artists!

1445
01:15:08,625 --> 01:15:09,916
[young Bergoglio] Jalics!

1446
01:15:11,125 --> 01:15:13,083
You need to close down Rivadavia.

1447
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:14,958
[scoffs]

1448
01:15:16,666 --> 01:15:17,541
What?

1449
01:15:17,625 --> 01:15:19,583
I need you to close this mission.

1450
01:15:21,958 --> 01:15:22,958
[Jalics] Yorio!

1451
01:15:23,916 --> 01:15:26,000
We didn't build this for nothing.

1452
01:15:26,083 --> 01:15:27,541
We can't abandon people.

1453
01:15:27,625 --> 01:15:31,583
With Massera,
if we haven't lost a Jesuit...

1454
01:15:31,666 --> 01:15:33,750
It's because you didn’t speak out.

1455
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:37,083
And made us irrelevant.

1456
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:42,916
They’re watching...

1457
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,916
and don’t like what they see.

1458
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:47,041
I know!

1459
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:51,875
- [Yorio] How?
- [young Bergoglio] What?

1460
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:55,541
How do you know that, Jorge?

1461
01:15:58,125 --> 01:16:00,125
[Jalics]
Did you go to President Videla's house?

1462
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:03,250
To give communion?

1463
01:16:07,041 --> 01:16:08,541
They are assassins, Jorge.

1464
01:16:15,166 --> 01:16:16,875
My role is to protect the Order.

1465
01:16:17,666 --> 01:16:18,791
[Yorio] Ah.

1466
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:21,708
That's our calling now?
To protect ourselves?

1467
01:16:22,583 --> 01:16:24,625
[Jalics] I taught you...

1468
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:26,958
How do we know Christ?

1469
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,450
By following in His footsteps.

1470
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,041
Where do they lead?

1471
01:16:30,125 --> 01:16:30,958
Here.

1472
01:16:31,041 --> 01:16:33,250
[young Bergoglio]
Or before a firing squad!

1473
01:16:33,333 --> 01:16:35,166
If that's so, so be it!

1474
01:16:37,041 --> 01:16:38,958
[young Bergoglio] I'm your superior.

1475
01:16:39,291 --> 01:16:42,541
I'm begging you to return to the seminary!

1476
01:16:43,125 --> 01:16:44,416
If we don't obey?

1477
01:16:45,583 --> 01:16:48,125
[young Bergoglio]
You are Jesuits. You made vows!

1478
01:16:49,416 --> 01:16:51,750
Break them, and you're no longer Jesuits!

1479
01:16:51,833 --> 01:16:54,666
If we aren’t Jesuits, we lose protection.

1480
01:16:55,458 --> 01:16:57,375
It's like a death sentence.

1481
01:16:57,458 --> 01:16:59,916
So keep your vows. Damn it!

1482
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:03,458
We refuse to cease our work.

1483
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:06,458
You keep drinking tea with killers.

1484
01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:10,083
Listen to me!

1485
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:12,625
I'll talk to whoever helps me save lives.

1486
01:17:12,875 --> 01:17:13,750
Mm-hmm.

1487
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:17,708
And you obey. Shut down the project!

1488
01:17:17,791 --> 01:17:18,791
[chuckles]

1489
01:17:18,875 --> 01:17:20,041
It is an order.

1490
01:17:20,583 --> 01:17:21,583
[sighs]

1491
01:17:22,791 --> 01:17:25,250
You hear? It's an order!

1492
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:29,583
[Bergoglio, in English]
<i>But they disobeyed my orders.</i>

1493
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:32,875
<i>Questioned my authority.</i>

1494
01:17:40,958 --> 01:17:44,625
You talk about, uh... your authority.
What did you do with that authority?

1495
01:17:44,875 --> 01:17:46,083
[speaks indistinctly]

1496
01:17:48,416 --> 01:17:50,958
[Benedict]
<i>You used it to save dozens of lives.</i>

1497
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,500
<i>It's in your file.</i>

1498
01:17:52,916 --> 01:17:55,000
[in Spanish] I brought you some food...

1499
01:17:55,083 --> 01:17:57,517
[Benedict, in English]
<i>And you hid families of trade unionists</i>

1500
01:17:57,541 --> 01:17:58,666
<i>in the seminary.</i>

1501
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:02,000
You even drove some of them
up to the border yourself.

1502
01:18:02,083 --> 01:18:03,791
[stammers] It wasn't enough.

1503
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:07,083
No. No, not for your...

1504
01:18:08,041 --> 01:18:10,250
brother Jesuits, no.

1505
01:18:10,791 --> 01:18:12,471
[young Bergoglio in Spanish]
It's an order!

1506
01:18:14,166 --> 01:18:17,291
[Bergoglio, in English] <i>Pride...
obscured my judgment.</i>

1507
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,708
<i>Their right to say Mass was removed.</i>

1508
01:18:21,916 --> 01:18:24,625
<i>And with it, the protection of the Church.</i>

1509
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:30,958
I was supposed to protect them.

1510
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:32,416
I failed.

1511
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,500

Who's the priest?

1518
01:19:09,583 --> 01:19:10,708
Keep cool.

[indistinct shouting]

1529
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:07,375
They were taken away
and tortured for months.

[young Bergoglio] Admiral.

Admiral,

1544
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:48,875
you have my priests Jalics and Yorio...

1545

detained.

1546
01:20:50,541 --> 01:20:53,291
They are not political.

1547
01:20:53,708 --> 01:20:55,148
[Massera] Why did you kick them out?

1548
01:20:55,208 --> 01:20:57,916
They were temporarily suspended.

1549
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,875
A technical matter.

1550
01:21:00,208 --> 01:21:01,750
Who told you?

1551
01:21:01,833 --> 01:21:03,708
We see and hear everything.

[young Bergoglio] Four months.

What are you doing to them?

1554
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,791
[Massera] Enough, Bergoglio!

1555
01:21:08,875 --> 01:21:11,666
I know full well where my priests are!

1556

They're not your priests.

1557
01:21:13,958 --> 01:21:15,375
You just said so.

1558
01:21:16,625 --> 01:21:18,083
It's a "technical matter."

- [crowd applauds]

[in Spanish] You should think

[in English] My words had no impact.

Where was Christ in all this?

Was he taking tea
in the presidential palace?

1580

Or was he being tortured in prisons,

01:32:41,791 --> 01:32:43,125
So... [sighs]

1744
01:32:43,208 --> 01:32:46,291
...if you'll allow me, my son.

1745
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:48,750
You must...

1746
01:32:49,333 --> 01:32:51,833
believe in the mercy that you preach.

1747
01:32:53,583 --> 01:32:54,916
[in Latin] I absolve you

1748
01:32:55,166 --> 01:32:57,875
in the name of the Father,
the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

1749
01:32:58,250 --> 01:32:59,666
- [softly] Amen.
- Hm.

1750
01:33:02,291 --> 01:33:04,101
- [in English] Thank you, Father.
- [door opens]

1751
01:33:04,125 --> 01:33:05,325
[man, in Italian] Holy Father.

1752
01:33:05,375 --> 01:33:06,375
It's nine o'clock.

1753
01:33:06,458 --> 01:33:09,434
- They are opening the doors to the public.
- [Benedict, in English] I forgot.

1754
01:33:09,458 --> 01:33:10,333
<i>Grazie. Danke.</i>

1755
01:33:10,416 --> 01:33:12,017
[in Italian] Would you like me
to delay the opening?

1756
01:33:12,041 --> 01:33:13,961
[in English] No.
Most of these people have waited

1757
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,458
- most of their lives to see this.
- [chuckles]

1758
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:17,750
[Benedict] This way.

1759
01:33:18,416 --> 01:33:20,336
Yeah. Come with me,
I want to show you something.

1760
01:33:20,375 --> 01:33:22,517
- [Bergoglio] <i>Grazie.</i>
- [Benedict] This is the sacristy,

1761
01:33:22,541 --> 01:33:25,208
- known as the Chamber of Tears.
- [Bergoglio] Ah.

1762
01:33:25,291 --> 01:33:29,208
[Benedict] I don't know if they're
the tears of, uh, joy or tears of sorrow.

1763
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:32,583
You know, I came in through that door
as Joseph Ratzinger,

1764
01:33:32,666 --> 01:33:34,106
and I went out through the same door

1765
01:33:34,166 --> 01:33:36,583
- as Pope Benedict XVI.
- [Bergoglio] Ah.

1766
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:40,750
Oh!

1767
01:33:41,708 --> 01:33:42,708
<i>Grazie.</i>

1768
01:33:42,916 --> 01:33:43,916
Thank you.

1769
01:33:45,083 --> 01:33:47,250
Holy Father, are... are you hungry?

1770
01:33:47,875 --> 01:33:49,208
- Hungry?
- Ah, <i>sí.</i>

1771
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,666
Yes, perhaps, you know,
I think I am hungry.

1772
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:55,250
- Do you want me to ask the kitchen to...
- No, no, no, there's no need. There's a...

1773
01:33:55,333 --> 01:33:59,166
There is a place
just in front of the Porta Angelica.

1774
01:33:59,416 --> 01:34:02,416
Oh, you know it?
Excellent pizza and coffee.

1775
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:03,708
- Pizza?
- [Benedict] Yeah.

1776
01:34:03,791 --> 01:34:05,416
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh, no? Okay.

1777
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:06,333
Pizza, okay.

1778
01:34:06,416 --> 01:34:10,708
[in Italian] A margherita and diavola,
two Fantas, and a coffee.

1779
01:34:11,166 --> 01:34:13,666
- [in English] Please, no photos.
- [assistant] Excuse me.

1780
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:15,000
- Excuse me.
- Whoa!

1781
01:34:15,083 --> 01:34:16,458
[guard] This way.

1782
01:34:16,541 --> 01:34:17,833
Excuse me.

1783
01:34:17,916 --> 01:34:19,416
You know, always, in the past,

1784
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:22,500
whenever a pope,
or Holy Father, would eat,

1785
01:34:22,583 --> 01:34:24,375
at every meal, always at his side,

1786
01:34:25,375 --> 01:34:28,666
would be three Jesuit brothers, and...

1787
01:34:29,458 --> 01:34:31,750
- they were his food tasters.
- [chuckles]

1788
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:36,000
I think the lack of Jesuits has probably
poisoned more than one Holy Father.

1789
01:34:36,083 --> 01:34:39,500
[laughs] Perhaps I should take a bite
out of your slice, huh?

1790
01:34:39,583 --> 01:34:43,000
- Just to be on the safe side.
- No. No. That's mine. That's my pizza.

1791
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:46,875
- Would you say grace, Holy Father?
- [sniffs] Yes.

1792
01:34:47,791 --> 01:34:48,791
Yes.

1793
01:34:53,833 --> 01:34:56,375
Thank you, Lord, for this food
that we enjoy here,

1794
01:34:56,875 --> 01:34:58,666
in this place outside of time.

1795
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:02,833
See, Lord, your Church, your flock

1796
01:35:02,916 --> 01:35:04,833
is under attack, is in crisis.

1797
01:35:05,416 --> 01:35:07,875
God, grant us the wisdom
and the strength

1798
01:35:07,958 --> 01:35:10,125
to oppose the hypocrisy
that disfigures her.

1799
01:35:11,375 --> 01:35:12,416
St. Francis,

1800
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,250
intercede for us
as we seek to repair the Church.

1801
01:35:17,958 --> 01:35:19,583
Would you like to add something?

1802
01:35:20,166 --> 01:35:21,166
Amen.

1803
01:35:21,333 --> 01:35:23,000
Amen. It's good.

1804
01:35:23,083 --> 01:35:24,083
Yeah.

1805
01:35:26,958 --> 01:35:27,958
Mm.

1806
01:35:29,125 --> 01:35:30,245
[in Spanish] Good, isn't it?

1807
01:35:30,291 --> 01:35:31,500
Mm! [munches]

1808
01:35:33,833 --> 01:35:35,291
[in English] You know, I was, um...

1809
01:35:36,583 --> 01:35:38,291
thinking about your teachers,

1810
01:35:39,166 --> 01:35:40,583
Yorio and Jalics.

1811
01:35:40,958 --> 01:35:44,375
<i>- Did you ever reconcile with them?</i>
- [Bergoglio] <i>With Jalics, yes.</i>

1812
01:35:44,458 --> 01:35:46,000
<i>We said a Mass together.</i>

1813
01:35:46,083 --> 01:35:48,875
[in Spanish]
Can you light the candles, please?

1814
01:35:49,291 --> 01:35:51,000
[Jalics] They're lit, Father.

1815
01:35:51,125 --> 01:35:53,125
[church bells ringing]

1816
01:35:54,708 --> 01:35:55,708
Jalics.

1817
01:35:57,333 --> 01:35:59,791
Can you pass the stole? We're late.

1818
01:36:03,041 --> 01:36:06,000
[young Bergoglio] <i>In the name
of the Father, the Son,</i>

1819
01:36:06,083 --> 01:36:07,666
<i>and the Holy Spirit.</i>

1820
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:09,625
- [bells ring]
- [young Bergoglio] <i>Amen.</i>

1821
01:36:10,791 --> 01:36:12,000
Lord, wash me clean...

1822
01:36:12,833 --> 01:36:14,041
from my sins,

1823
01:36:16,125 --> 01:36:17,375
so I can celebrate...

1824
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,666
these sacred mysteries.

1825
01:36:26,958 --> 01:36:28,625
Now, let's give each other,

1826
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:31,041
everyone,

1827
01:36:32,083 --> 01:36:34,875
a fraternal hug for peace.

1828
01:36:50,875 --> 01:36:52,275
[Bergoglio, in English] <i>We cried...</i>

1829
01:36:53,625 --> 01:36:54,916
<i>in each other's arms.</i>

1830
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:20,666
[sighs]

1831
01:37:22,791 --> 01:37:23,833
He forgave me.

1832
01:37:27,625 --> 01:37:28,833
[Benedict] And Yorio?

1833
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:30,750
No.

1834
01:37:32,208 --> 01:37:34,833
To the end, he saw me as a traitor.

1835
01:37:36,875 --> 01:37:38,416
[sighs] And then he died.

1836
01:37:40,708 --> 01:37:44,791
I'm still seen as a divisive figure
in Argentina.

1837
01:37:46,291 --> 01:37:47,291
Huh.

1838
01:37:49,333 --> 01:37:50,333
[chuckles]

1839
01:37:52,041 --> 01:37:53,041
[sighs]

1840
01:37:53,625 --> 01:37:55,375
You know, yesterday you said, uh...

1841
01:37:55,958 --> 01:37:57,291
"Life is never static."

1842
01:37:57,916 --> 01:37:58,916
Yeah?

1843
01:37:59,708 --> 01:38:00,708
Well...

1844
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:03,750
You know...

1845
01:38:05,458 --> 01:38:09,541
you lead... not by power
and not by intellect,

1846
01:38:09,625 --> 01:38:10,708
but you lead by...

1847
01:38:10,791 --> 01:38:12,625
you particularly, you lead by, um...

1848
01:38:13,083 --> 01:38:15,208
the way you live
or the way you have lived.

1849
01:38:15,416 --> 01:38:17,208
- You've changed.
- [chuckles]

1850
01:38:22,833 --> 01:38:23,958
That man is...

1851
01:38:25,416 --> 01:38:26,500
is still inside me.

1852
01:38:26,583 --> 01:38:27,666
That doubt, it...

1853
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:29,666
it still exists.

1854
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:30,750
[Benedict] Mm-hmm.

1855
01:38:31,166 --> 01:38:32,708
- Hmm?
- Um...

1856
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,166
You think your sins disqualify you,

1857
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:36,625
but we are all sinners.

1858
01:38:37,375 --> 01:38:39,750
Now, please, hear my confession.

1859
01:38:41,833 --> 01:38:44,208
Well, would you deny me a confession,
Bergoglio?

1860
01:38:44,291 --> 01:38:46,708
No, no, don't kneel.
Don't kneel. Please, Holy Father.

1861
01:38:46,791 --> 01:38:48,625
- [Benedict] Oh.
- [Bergoglio] Sit, please.

1862
01:38:48,708 --> 01:38:53,250
I think if I sit,
it'll have to be an informal confession.

1863
01:38:54,833 --> 01:38:55,833
What should I say?

1864
01:38:56,541 --> 01:38:58,458
I don't know. What do you usually say?

1865
01:39:01,750 --> 01:39:03,666
How long since your last confession?

1866
01:39:04,375 --> 01:39:06,541
Eight... seven... eight days.

1867
01:39:07,083 --> 01:39:09,000
And have you sinned greatly in that...

1868
01:39:09,083 --> 01:39:11,250
I'm sorry,
I... I don't mean to imply that you...

1869
01:39:11,333 --> 01:39:13,000
[chuckles] Of course I've sinned.

1870
01:39:14,125 --> 01:39:16,833
Several numerous venial sins,

1871
01:39:17,291 --> 01:39:18,291
and, uh...

1872
01:39:19,125 --> 01:39:21,458
But I'm getting too old and, uh, forgetful

1873
01:39:21,541 --> 01:39:22,875
to remember what they are.

1874
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:25,000
- Can you say that?
- [Benedict] Yeah.

1875
01:39:25,083 --> 01:39:28,125
I didn't know you could say that.
That's... That's useful.

1876
01:39:30,750 --> 01:39:34,458
I've sinned against you, Lord,
whom I should love above all things.

1877
01:39:37,291 --> 01:39:39,541
As a child, I failed you first by not...

1878
01:39:40,375 --> 01:39:43,083
having the courage
to taste of life itself.

1879
01:39:44,958 --> 01:39:47,250
Instead, I hid away in books,
and then study.

1880
01:39:48,625 --> 01:39:49,625
[sighs]

1881
01:39:51,833 --> 01:39:53,000
I know now that this...

1882
01:39:54,083 --> 01:39:56,250
left me empty and void of the world...

1883
01:39:56,916 --> 01:40:00,000
[chuckles]...for which the Church is...
meant to help.

1884
01:40:04,583 --> 01:40:05,583
Go on.

1885
01:40:11,166 --> 01:40:12,166
[exhales]

1886
01:40:16,666 --> 01:40:18,625
Remember Father Maciel?

1887
01:40:19,791 --> 01:40:21,708
There were claims 12 years ago

1888
01:40:22,291 --> 01:40:25,125
that his molesting of boys

1889
01:40:25,208 --> 01:40:27,208
continued for decades... [voice fades]

1890
01:40:27,291 --> 01:40:29,291
[high-pitched ringing]

1891
01:40:49,250 --> 01:40:51,250
[ringing fades]

1892
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,166
[takes a deep breath]

1893
01:40:54,291 --> 01:40:59,041
Yes, I did not give sufficient attention
to the duties assigned to this one priest.

1894
01:40:59,125 --> 01:41:00,583
Sufficient attention?

1895
01:41:02,583 --> 01:41:03,875
Village after village?

1896
01:41:04,375 --> 01:41:05,375
Yeah.

1897
01:41:05,958 --> 01:41:08,333
- But you knew!
- [Benedict] Yes, I should've known.

1898
01:41:09,166 --> 01:41:10,166
I should've known.

1899
01:41:10,750 --> 01:41:12,934

- [Bergoglio] You said there was more.

Evidence was placed on my desk, but...

1901
01:41:16,291 --> 01:41:19,000
You forgot to love the people
you are meant to protect.

1902
01:41:19,083 --> 01:41:20,083
[Benedict] Yes.

1903

- [Bergoglio] Father...

1904
01:41:25,333 --> 01:41:27,625
if this is the sole reason
you wish to resign,

1905
01:41:27,708 --> 01:41:31,833
it is even more important that you stay,
heal the wound.

1906

- Complete the work you have begun.

every reason I give you is not enough.

So, let me tell you again,

1909
01:41:38,791 --> 01:41:42,541
I can no longer sit

do you understand me?

1912
01:41:48,458 --> 01:41:50,666
No. No, you're mistaken.
You are mistaken.

Since I was a child, as a boy,

01:42:23,291 --> 01:42:25,625
I always felt His presence with me,
at my side.

1920
01:42:26,083 --> 01:42:28,541
For my entire life, I have been alone,

1921
01:42:29,083 --> 01:42:31,416
but never lonely, until now.

1922
01:42:31,833 --> 01:42:34,166
[Bergoglio sighs] I'm so sorry.

Yeah.

1924

But now I can hear His voice
these last two days.

1925
01:42:42,791 --> 01:42:44,208
I've heard His voice again.

1926
01:42:44,291 --> 01:42:45,291
- I'm glad.
- Yes.

1927
01:42:47,875 --> 01:42:52,208
And the voice is the last one
I expected to hear Him speak with.

1928
01:42:52,625 --> 01:42:53,708
It was your voice.

1929
01:42:54,625 --> 01:42:55,875
- [Bergoglio] No.
- Yeah.

1930
01:42:58,666 --> 01:43:02,541
I think, perhaps, I could not hear Him
not because He was withdrawing from me,

1931
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:04,583
but because He was saying,

1932
01:43:06,166 --> 01:43:07,166
"Go,

1933
01:43:07,958 --> 01:43:09,416

[Bergoglio] God, the Father of mercies,

1936
01:43:20,416 --> 01:43:22,291
has sent the Holy Spirit among us

1937
01:43:22,666 --> 01:43:24,375
for the forgiveness of sins.

1938
01:43:25,375 --> 01:43:27,958
May God grant you His pardon and peace.

1939
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,333
- And I absolve you of your sins.
- [exhales]

that truth may be vital,

1942

00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:27,695
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): Want
me to come pick you up?

3
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:28,596
LILY (ON PHONE): OK.

4
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:29,630
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): OK.

5
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:30,398
Oh, that's what they tell me.

6
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:31,199
OK, all right.

7
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,600
Bye.

8
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:33,601
Hey, Merry.

9
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:34,502
Hey.

10
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,803
MERRY (ON PHONE): Hey.

11
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:36,804
-Sure.

12
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:38,472
Yeah, I'll come pick her up.

13
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:40,274
This is the best protein
drink ever right here.

14
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:47,681
Gotta stay lean and fit.

15
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:52,686
Omega-3s, omega-6s, and a little
bit of saturated fat.

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,588
But it's good fat.

17
00:00:54,622 --> 00:00:56,490
Ah, maybe I'll cut a mango up.

18
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:57,491
Let's just try that one today.

19
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:58,659
Oh, man, that's a raw--

20
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:00,228
that's a pretty old mango.

21
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:02,263
This is what it's like when
you're a bachelor.

22
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:04,298
You have old, raw stuff.

23
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,337
It-- it doesn't need
to go in there.

24
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:19,147
Oh, I almost forgot--

25
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,450
forgot my, uh, coffee.

26
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:23,651
I've done that before.

27
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:30,458
But we're about to go pick up
my daughter right now, which

28
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:32,226
is great because Lily
lives close to me.

29
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,494
And it's wonderful.

30
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,229
But she lives with me half
the time or with

31
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:36,230
mom half the time.

32
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:38,366
We have a good relationship.

33
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:39,667
Hey, sweetie.

34
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,870
There you go.

35
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,272
Lily, are you--

36
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:46,307
are you already texting
this morning?

37
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,608
Oh, my gosh.

38
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:48,576
How many texts do you
think you do a day?

39
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,413
-Oh, you don't do 1,000.

40
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,348
But you do a lot, don't you?

41
00:01:54,382 --> 00:01:55,849
Are you-- a day?

42
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:57,251
See you about 2:00.

43
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:02,456
Are you excited about
coming today?

44
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,524
Huh?

45
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:04,425
It's going to be
fun, isn't it?

46
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,626
What are we do today?

47
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:08,229
Are we going to do two
fillings today?

48
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:11,765
I think we are, aren't we?

49
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,867
Can I ask-- can I ask
you another-- can

50
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:15,736
I ask another question?

51
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:16,870
Please?

52
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:20,674
Just one more question,
just one.

53
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,676
I'm not going to ask
two questions.

54
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:29,617
Can I ask three questions?

55
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,186
KID (OFFSCREEN): Yes.

56
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,555
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): Can I ask
you just like-- can I ask five

57
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,957
questions or one?

58
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,925
Five--

59
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:38,959
all right.

60
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:39,793
Question number five.

61
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:40,561
You ready?

62
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:42,463
[phone rings]

63
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,797
-Dr. Hardy's office.

64
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,533
This is Tina.

65
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,536
-If you was another age-- if
you were another age, would

66
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,538
you like to be seven or eight?

67
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:52,273
If you-- could you--

68
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,308
which would you like to--

69
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:56,544
can I ask you another
question?

70
00:02:56,577 --> 00:03:00,748
-Dr. Hardy as a boss is just
like he is as a friend.

71
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:04,385
I mean, we to him just
like he's one of us.

72
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:07,221
We talk to him about anything.

73
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:09,690
-Not long after George set up
his practice, we had some

74
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:13,694
students who had major dental
work that needed to be done.

75
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:18,299
And George, after one phone
call, took that on, basically

76
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:21,602
transformed the lives of a
couple of kids by doing their

77
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,337
dental work totally free.

78
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:26,307
Didn't have to do that, but did
it because he know that's

79
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,308
what those kids needed.

80
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,642
And it's change their lives.

81
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:30,578
-Which one do you like?

82
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,513
Which one do you
like, sweetie?

83
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:36,684
-George Hardy is the most
authentic, alive person.

84
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,952
A lot of people, as they get
older, they get set in their

85
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,788
ways, and they get bored
with their life.

86
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,656
Or they just get settled.

87
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,957
Somebody like George--
he's not settled.

88
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:44,692
You know?

89
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:45,826
He's alive.

90
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:46,894
-Will you kill me
if I tell them?

91
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:47,628
-No, tell them.

92
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,397
Tell them.

93
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,366
-The reason that the home town
folks love George is because

94
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,370
George dresses up like a roller
blading tooth fairy in

95
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:58,439
the Christmas parade
every year.

96
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:05,479
-I'm--

97
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:06,380
I'm trying to think
of somebody that

98
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:07,915
might not like George.

99
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:08,582
I can't think of one person who
doesn't like George Hardy.

100
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,426
I mean if his ex-wife likes
him as much as I like him,

101
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,994
then, you know, I think it'd be
pretty hard for anybody to

102
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:22,763
not like George.

103
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:26,400
-He has always been one of the
most fun people that I know.

104
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:29,670
I don't think I've ever seen
George when he wasn't smiling.

105
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,004
-Hey, Barbara.

106
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:31,905
-Hey, George.

107
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:32,873
How are you?

108
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:33,574
-Good, how about you?

109
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,442
-I'm fine.

110
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,610
Good to see you too.

111
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:39,547
He loves people, and he likes
the reaction that

112
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,881
he gets from people.

113
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,383
-How you been?

114
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,518
You always answer the
phone so great here.

115
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:45,519
I just--

116
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:46,053
-Oh, thank you.

117
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:47,588
Thank you.

118
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,689
-Really, honestly, every
time I call down here.

119
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,491
Hey, how you doing?

120
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:54,795
-He is one of the-- the kindest
and finest people that

121
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:58,599
I have ever seen in my life,
even though he's my son.

122
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,001
He's just-- he's just
fun to be around.

123
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:06,940
MICHAEL (OFFSCREEN): What did
you think of your son's

124
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:10,010
performance in "Troll 2?"

125
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,579
-Oh, my gosh.

126
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:15,115
[laughs]

127
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,717
Let's say, he's--

128
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,918
he's not very grand.

129
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:24,525
-So where's that damn mirror?

130
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:26,694
-Well, I left in about the
middle of the movie.

131
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:28,095
I just couldn't take
it anymore.

132
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,431
And I thought, what
is he doing?

133
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:32,700
-It's got to be your
imagination or a

134
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,067
hallucination.

135
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,404
Are you still smoking
dope, Holly?

136
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:37,971
-I've known George for years.

137
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:41,074
And he came in the store one
day, and I asked him.

138
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,444
I said, you know, George, were
you ever in a movie?

139
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,446
And he said, uh, yes.

140
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,614
Why?

141
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:48,048
And I said, well, I
think I saw it.

142
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:51,852
I said, I saw this movie "Troll
2." And it was just

143
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:54,922
crazy because nobody in the
community even knew that

144
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,724
George was in a film.

145
00:05:56,757 --> 00:06:00,394
-We don't speak too much about
it, but he did make his movie

146
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:02,563
about 17 years ago.

147
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,932
We didn't know whether to tell
people about it or kind of

148
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,000
keep it quiet.

149
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,802
-I walked up to the counter,
and I said to the fella--

150
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:11,705
I said, I'm here to pick up a
movie that you've got on hold

151
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:15,976
called "Troll 2." And this guy
that's standing next to me at

152
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,045
the counter-- he was getting
another movie too.

153
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,414
And he looked at me, and
he said, oh, my gosh.

154
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:22,483
He said, that's the worst
movie I've ever seen.

155
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:32,860
[screams]

156
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,862
-Wait till you get home
and watch the movie.

157
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,030
And he was right.

158
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,098
-It was so bad.

159
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,133
And he was so--

160
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,503
his accent and his acting--

161
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,838
it was just so--

162
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:47,207
just the strangest
thing to watch.

163
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,042
-It was so not him.

164
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,578
You know?

165
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,813
Knowing the real person
in seeing him doing--

166
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,715
using the word acting loosely.

167
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,149
It was just hilarious.

168
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:59,219
-Do you see this writing?

169
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,121
Do you know what it means?

170
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:04,958
Hospitality.

171
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:08,729
And you can't piss
on hospitality.

172
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,831
I won't allow it!

173
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,966
-What are you going to
do to me, daddy?

174
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,535
-Tightening my belt
by one loop so I

175
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:15,703
don't feel hunger pains.

176
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:16,904
MICHAEL (OFFSCREEN):
OK, pause it.

177
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,171
Rewind.

178
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:19,573
He's right there.

179
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,879
That's me, Michael
Paul Stephenson.

180
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:30,918
And 18 years ago, I got the lead
role in my first movie.

181
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,185
-Nilbog.

182
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:34,655
It's goblin spelled backwards!

183
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,724
MICHAEL (OFFSCREEN): At that
time, the movie was titled

184
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:39,660
"Goblin." It was directed by
Italian filmmaker Claudio

185
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:44,131
Fragasso and written by his
wife, Rosella Drudi.

186
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:47,200
We filmed the movie over the
course of three weeks in

187
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:50,904
small-town Utah in the
summer of 1989.

188
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:51,905
It was hard work.

189
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,206
It was-- it was tough work.

190
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,744
But it was a small price
to pay for stardom.

191
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,919
See, as a child actor, this was
the big break that I was

192
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,187
waiting for.

193
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,789
I thought that I was
going to be famous.

194
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:12,225
I couldn't wait to see my
movie on the big screen.

195
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:17,665
But my movie never made
it to the big screen.

196
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:21,702
In fact, the first time that
I saw my movie was one year

197
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,572
later on Christmas morning.

198
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:31,845
I unwrapped my last present to
reveal a VHS copy of my movie.

199
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,147
I was so excited to see
this for the first

200
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,683
time with my family.

201
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,751
I grabbed the tape, and
I stuck it in the VCR.

202
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:40,988
And then I pressed play.

203
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:44,224
[screams]

204
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,927
-90 minutes later, my childhood

205
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,261
dreams went up in flames.

206
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,736
I hated this movie.

207
00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:00,140
I ran from "Troll 2," and I
wanted nothing to do with it.

208
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:04,277
But that was before I realized
that there was more to this

209
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:07,615
movie than I understood.

210
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:11,284
And this is my movie
about that movie.

211
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,023
-Tightening my belt
by one loop so I

212
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,691
don't feel hunger pains.

213
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:19,793
And your sister and mother
will have to do likewise.

214
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:22,095
-I was practicing dentistry
in Salt Lake

215
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:23,631
City, Utah at the time.

216
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:24,998
I think it was about 1989.

217
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:28,068
And on a whim, I auditioned
for this movie.

218
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:29,637
And I did a few--

219
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,273
did dentistry about two or
three days or four days.

220
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,709
And then I'd go back and shoot
and then go back and do

221
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,877
dentistry and go
back and shoot.

222
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,046
I remember doing that
a few times.

223
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:43,851
The way I first found out that
the movie was released was by

224
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,352
one of my patients.

225
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,855
My patient goes, I seen you
in that movie, Dr. Hardy.

226
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:48,722
I seen you in that movie.

227
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:49,923
I go, what movie?

228
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,859
And he goes, "Troll 2."
And I go, what?

229
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:52,660
What is the name?

230
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:54,161
What?

231
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,830
Within a day or two, I got a
copy of "Troll 2" on VHS.

232
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:59,266
And I remember taking that
thing and putting it and

233
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,669
watching my first scene with
Margo on the couch.

234
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:03,270
-I'm worried about Joshua.

235
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:06,139
He's still seeing
Grandpa Seth.

236
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:09,276
-When I was a kid, I had an
imaginary playmate too.

237
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,211
-But it wasn't your
dead grandfather.

238
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,312
-And I thought, oh, man.

239
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,881
This is-- this is bad.

240
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,415
This is really, really bad.

241
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,884
-Michael?

242
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,319
-Yeah?

243
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,355
-Who are the goblins?

244
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,424
-The goblins?

245
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,860
Oh, when it first started
showing up on HBO and all

246
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:28,862
that, people would call
me from all over

247
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:30,097
the freaking place.

248
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,398
George, you're on TV!

249
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:35,769
I'd just go, I know.

250
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:36,670
I know.

251
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:38,371
I know I've been on it.

252
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,407
Just stop watching
it right now.

253
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,142
It gets worse.

254
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:47,280
-I went on a mission for my
church, and I was in Spain.

255
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,150
And all of a sudden, one
day I get this letter.

256
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:53,821
And it says, your movie's out.

257
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:54,722
And it's

258
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,790
called "Troll 2." -Damn.

259
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,225
There's no milk.

260
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,160
There's no coffee.

261
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,729
There's nothing.

262
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,764
Guys, didn't anyone remember
to bring supplies?

263
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:08,168
-And the first time that I saw
it, it was embarrassing.

264
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,238
I've got to admit, it was
embarrassing because m acting

265
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,006
was horrible.

266
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,946
And I think I maybe hoped it
wouldn't be as bad as it was.

267
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,413
But it was.

268
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:25,485
(SINGING) I'd like to dance
with you, honey.

269
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,989
I'd like to have romance.

270
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,357
I was in a crappy movie.

271
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,860
And I'm a crappy actor.

272
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,995
And that's OK because it's
not my thing that I do.

273
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,163
I do music.

274
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,798
I don't need to run
from this film.

275
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:42,770
But I can understand like Darren
and Connie and maybe

276
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:46,940
some of the other ones that do
acting and are trying to make

277
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:50,911
a career of acting, how they,
for a time, would try to just

278
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,379
kind of brush this away.

279
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,915
Who wants to put "Troll 2" on
their resume, you know?

280
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,483
If someone pulls it out
and watches it, you're

281
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:57,885
not getting the part.

282
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:59,753
-Oh, I think I recognize you.

283
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:01,889
Did you do a movie
about goblins

284
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,290
or trolls or something?

285
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,993
And there's that part of
you that wants to lie.

286
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:06,960
It's not on my resume.

287
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:08,528
You know?

288
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,230
But then you're like, oh, I
shouldn't lie, because I he'll

289
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,832
just look me up.

290
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:14,334
And so you go, uh-huh, and
leaving knowing I'm not

291
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:18,772
getting hired because of that.

292
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:19,973
-[groans]

293
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:21,141
-Release your instincts
in the bathroom!

294
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:22,342
-Are you nuts?

295
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,912
Are you trying to turn
me into a homo?

296
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,446
-It wouldn't be too hard.

297
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,416
If my father discovers you here,
he'd cut off your little

298
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:30,550
nuts and eat them.

299
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,020
He can't stand you.

300
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:34,154
-I was horrible in it.

301
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:36,256
And I knew I was
horrible in it.

302
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:39,359
And I was, like, devastated as a
little kid who's just like--

303
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:40,527
you know?

304
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,462
Well, I was a pre-teen,
even worse.

305
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,933
And I was just thinking,
oh, my gosh.

306
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:49,236
I suck.

307
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,971
I looked it up on--

308
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:54,441
on IMDb, and it was like one of
those slow motion moments

309
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:57,244
when you look down and you
see, like, the ratings.

310
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,112
And it says, worst
movie ever made.

311
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,281
And then I clicked
on Comments.

312
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:04,551
That was a bad move.

313
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,286
They're not just saying, that's
a horrible movie.

314
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:11,091
They're saying, you are a
horrible actor in the movie.

315
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,125
So it's not just the movie.

316
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,094
It's you too.

317
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,330
So it is personal.

318
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:22,169
From the moment I saw it the
first time on HBO, from that

319
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:25,906
very moment, I was like, oh,
I just want it to go away.

320
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,607
I just want it to go away.

321
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:33,046
CHRIS (OFFSCREEN): We can do
Holly's scene with the

322
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,915
boyfriend coming
in the window.

323
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:37,450
-I don't know that one.

324
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,886
Are you Holly?

325
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,287
-Sure.

326
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,521
-I could be Holly.

327
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:42,923
-[groans]

328
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,292
-Release your instincts
in the bathroom!

329
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,860
-Are you trying to turn
me into a homo?

330
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:47,627
Are you crazy?

331
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,229
-It wouldn't be too hard.

332
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:52,132
If my father discovers you
here, he'll cut off your

333
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,166
little nuts and eat them.

334
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,168
He can't stand you.

335
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:56,069
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
This is an

336
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:57,204
Atkins Research Program.

337
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:58,371
We're a marketing research
company.

338
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,407
We do focus groups and
also mock trials

339
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,509
for the general public.

340
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:05,178
Today, we are throwing
a "Troll 2" party.

341
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:06,479
We hold this annually.

342
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,649
And we're very proud
of what we do.

343
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,153
-I first saw the movie
when my friend Chris

344
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,121
introduced it to me.

345
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:15,655
We were at my house.

346
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,390
And he said, there's this
movie you've got to see.

347
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:20,193
I've watched it a million
times on VHS.

348
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:23,063
The most awful, worn,
used, dated copy.

349
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:26,599
But we popped it in, and it
was pure genius and joy.

350
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:29,002
We watched it a second
time right away.

351
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,203
-The movie came right
to video.

352
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:32,105
And my dad knew I loved
horror films.

353
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:33,606
So he rented it for me,
and he came over.

354
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,275
We would hang out every day.

355
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,077
And this was back in Detroit,
where we're both from.

356
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,946
And we watched the movie, and
then I showed it to my cousin.

357
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,413
And my cousin made fun of it.

358
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:41,949
He's like, it's the worst movie
ever, ever made. (HIGH

359
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,016
PITCHED) Nilbog.

360
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,517
It's goblin spelled backwards.

361
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,418
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): We just
started watching it over and

362
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:46,987
over and over again.

363
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,355
Every time we watched it,
we brought a new person.

364
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,158
Before you knew it, we
had groups of 10, and

365
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,926
then groups of 15.

366
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,694
And then we said, you know,
we've got to do this annually.

367
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,964
-Well, this is our fifth party.

368
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:57,530
-Fifth.

369
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,431
-Because we--

370
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,067
last year, we had two.

371
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,134
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
And it gets bigger every

372
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:02,135
single time.

373
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:03,136
CHRIS (OFFSCREEN): It does.

374
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,137
-Who hasn't seen the movie?

375
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:04,938
Who has not seen the movie?

376
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:05,672
Aha.

377
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,207
You've seen the movie.

378
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,076
So we're putting these
on everybody who are

379
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:11,945
virgins to the movie.

380
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:13,146
-I'm flowered.

381
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:17,951
-I've seen the movie.

382
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:19,352
-Have you seen it?

383
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,688
Aw, I'm so sorry, sweetie.

384
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,491
-I don't know anything about
the movie other than I've

385
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:27,394
heard it's not the horror film
it's supposed to be, which is

386
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,496
good because I don't
like horror films.

387
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,564
-It came after "Troll," which
has nothing to do with "Troll

388
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,633
2." There's not even trolls
in the movie.

389
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:37,337
It's like, I'm going to go for
a run and get some milk.

390
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,439
There's two guys shirtless
in the bed.

391
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:40,473
And then the grandpa.

392
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,042
The sister dance.

393
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:45,712
It's so funny that there's
no way you're going

394
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,515
to hate this movie.

395
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,050
-OK.

396
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,319
-I have tried to explain
"Troll 2" to people who

397
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:53,520
haven't seen it.

398
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,222
But words don't really
do it justice.

399
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:57,257
You really do just have
to see the movie.

400
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,128
Because I can tell you, well,
it's about a boy who goes on

401
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:03,030
vacation with his family.

402
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:07,200
And it turns out that everyone
there wants to turn them into

403
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:08,668
plants to eat them.

404
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:12,105
And his grandfather, who's dead,
is helping him on this

405
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,041
quest to rescue his family.

406
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,242
-Grandpa!

407
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,312
-Um, it just doesn't sound very

408
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,048
compelling to most people.

409
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,283
And then they're kind of like,
oh, I'm really glad you're

410
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,584
excited about that movie.

411
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:25,718
It sounds great.

412
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:27,420
But if you were actually
to see the

413
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:29,522
film, I mean, you just--

414
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,124
I feel like you wouldn't-- you'd
have to, like, not have

415
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:34,494
a heart or something
to not like it.

416
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:35,328
-Oh, my god.

417
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:36,329
You didn't see it?

418
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:37,097
-You haven't seen "Troll 2?"

419
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,631
-Put it in now.

420
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,033
No matter what you're doing,
you drop what you're doing.

421
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,301
You go, oh, you haven't
seen "Troll 2?"

422
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,735
We're watching it now.

423
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,437
-I'll watch it with you, and
I watched it yesterday.

424
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:47,040
And I'm excited it to
watch it today.

425
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:50,043
-I watched it twice this
morning, but I'll watch it

426
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:51,578
again with you right now.

427
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:52,812
-I'll watch it again with you
because I know that you're

428
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,181
going to love it.

429
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,823
-Thank you all for coming tot
he fifth annual Los Angeles

430
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,758
"Troll 2" party.

431
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,694
[cheering]

432
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,363
-I mean, I've heard people say
"Troll 2" is a religion.

433
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:13,466
And that makes complete sense
to me because in a religion,

434
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,468
what you're doing is you're
passing your religion on to

435
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:17,137
other people.

436
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,107
You're sharing what it is about
this that helps you and

437
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,841
that, you know-- and that
moves you through life.

438
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,543
And that's what people
do with this movie.

439
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,578
They pass the DVD around
like it's the Bible.

440
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:26,479
-All right.

441
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:28,115
We're going to start.

442
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:29,649
-By every conceivable measure,
this is a bad film.

443
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,751
By every conceivable measure
that you've ever learned in

444
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,420
film school, if you've seen five
movies in your lifetime.

445
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,493
But again, it's all fun.

446
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:43,630
I mean, you know, bad food is
bad, and bad books are bad.

447
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:46,466
But bad movies are
not always bad.

448
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:49,269
-You guys have, uh, "Troll 2?"

449
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:52,372
-That is in the holy fucking
shit section.

450
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,473
-The holy fucking
shit section.

451
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:54,307
-Yeah, just right over here.

452
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:55,542
-Both are on here.

453
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,210
But it's pointing to
"Troll 2," right?

454
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:59,479
-That's the one that deserves
the holy fucking shit.

455
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,148
-OK.

456
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,416
When I heard rumblings of "Troll
2" becoming more like a

457
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,586
cult film and more popular, I
thought to myself, hey, there

458
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:09,256
must be something to this.

459
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,424
It says, hey, George, thank
you for adding me.

460
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,327
I just wanted to let you know
that "Troll 2" is one of my

461
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:16,129
favorite films of all time.

462
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:19,566
Thank you for being a part
of cinematic history.

463
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,503
You are a lucky man to have
acted in such a magical movie.

464
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:24,637
Wow.

465
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,306
Do you have 11 pages
of messages?

466
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:27,574
-No.

467
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,209
-Well, I do.

468
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:32,212
And I've been on Myspace enough
time that you have.

469
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,680
I said, is this really true?

470
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,248
Is it really a cult
phenomenon?

471
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:37,650
You know, I just found it
hard to believe that--

472
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:40,287
that it really was
that popular.

473
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,256
-We were supposed to do like a
routine here at UCB for a show

474
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,725
called the It Sucked Awards.

475
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:48,228
It's like a yearly roundup
of t things that sucked.

476
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:51,731
And that George saw that a copy
of the "New York Times"

477
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:54,667
with the little write up of,
and John Gemberling showed

478
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:57,370
clips from "Troll 2," which
won, like, the It

479
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:59,806
Sucked movie category.

480
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,775
-And I said, hey, my name
is George Hardy.

481
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:06,579
I'm from the movie "Troll 2."
And all of a sudden, I hear in

482
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,181
the background, oh, my god.

483
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:11,751
You guys, it's-- it's George
Hardy on the phone.

484
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,354
-This is the most surreal
fucking thing I've ever

485
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:15,455
experienced in my life.

486
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:25,332
This is the dad from
"Troll 2."

487
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,334
DARREN (OFFSCREEN): First
time in New York.

488
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,335
Have you been here before?

489
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,303
-I haven't.

490
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,704
What time does the
thing start?

491
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,306
-Uh, 9:00.

492
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,308
-9:00?

493
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:36,709
-I don't know.

494
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:37,710
I don't know.

495
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:38,711
I don't know what to expect.

496
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,347
-I hear they sold out.

497
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,782
I hear that the may even have
standing room only.

498
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:45,252
I hear there may be people
turned away.

499
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:51,391
-I put up one post on Myspace,
one, saying,

500
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:53,326
we're having this screening.

501
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,364
And within two days, I had
over 100 respondents.

502
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:58,665
JOHN (OFFSCREEN): We
didn't do anything.

503
00:19:58,698 --> 00:19:59,832
CURTIS (OFFSCREEN): We
really did nothing.

504
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,301
JOHN (OFFSCREEN): I
mean, we can't--

505
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,001
CURTIS (OFFSCREEN): The
thing sold itself.

506
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:02,769
We cannot take credit.

507
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:03,470
-I came from LA.

508
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:04,003
-Cape Cod.

509
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:04,771
-New Jersey.

510
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,539
-Connecticut.

511
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:08,308
-This guy right here came all
the way from North Carolina.

512
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,743
-We would've walked here for
this from West Virginia, man.

513
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:14,514
-Just numbers wise, there were
the most people here that, up

514
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,882
to that point, had ever--

515
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,550
ever squeezed into the room.

516
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:37,470
-The energy inside that place
was just amazing.

517
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:41,874
-"Troll 2" is the best movie
in the world, the world.

518
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,876
-It's unmatched by any movie.

519
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:47,447
I've gone from movie store to
movie store to try and find

520
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,450
another movie that even comes
close. "Troll 2" just blows

521
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:51,684
them out of the water.

522
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:54,587
-All these guys just
go, you rock, man.

523
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:55,355
You rock.

524
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:56,055
You're my hero.

525
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:56,956
-I'm smitten right now.

526
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,758
I'm speechless.

527
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,861
-You would have thought that,
like, Robert De Niro had come

528
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,363
into the building.

529
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:04,864
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): They
want our autographs.

530
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:06,466
They're shaking when
they see us.

531
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:08,968
And I'm looking around,
just going, wow.

532
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:09,902
Wow.

533
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,304
This is bizarre.

534
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:18,445
-It's just a new thing for me
to be signing autographs,

535
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:21,581
signing girls' t-shirts, you
know, to be taking pictures

536
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,316
with people.

537
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,085
And in the back of my mind, I'd
be like going, I'm just in

538
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,587
this crappy movie.

539
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,657
-I think of the, you know,
shot composition,

540
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:35,027
cinematography, acting,
directing, writing.

541
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:41,968
Few movies fucked each of those
up completely and still

542
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,103
retained their eminent
watch-ability.

543
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,605
-Yes.

544
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,739
-There's not even
a movie screen.

545
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,641
It's like a projector screen.

546
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:50,677
There's a column,
terribly placed.

547
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,544
-It's a horrible place
to watch a movie

548
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:52,745
-In eye line.

549
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:53,780
-It is like one of the
worst places to

550
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,648
try to watch a movie.

551
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:57,116
But people loved it.

552
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,718
FEMALE SPEAKER (IN MOVIE): Don't
tell my father, but he's

553
00:21:58,751 --> 00:21:59,886
coming with us tomorrow.

554
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,554
[laughter]

555
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:03,956
-It's really hard to fathom that
this film, that was shot

556
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:08,060
for a couple $100,000, 17 years
later is being played to

557
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:09,862
300 adoring fans.

558
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:12,999
[applause]

559
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:13,966
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): My
heart is beating,

560
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,002
like, 100 miles a minute.

561
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:19,806
People clapping and people
cheering and throwing their

562
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,007
arms up and yelling.

563
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:27,013
And I just thought,
you know what?

564
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:28,448
Just go out there and
have fun with these

565
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:29,849
folks, you know, tonight.

566
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,818
[chanting]

567
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,029
-Let's see, um, OK.

568
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:44,597
You can't piss on--

569
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:46,566
[cheering]

570
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:52,539
AUDIENCE (OFFSCREEN): Come on!

571
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:53,706
Come on!

572
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:57,877
AUDIENCE (OFFSCREEN):
Tighten that belt!

573
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,479
-I can't really tighten
my belt.

574
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:00,580
AUDIENCE (OFFSCREEN): [shouts]

575
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:01,848
-You can't piss on
hospitality!

576
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:02,849
I won't allow it!

577
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,851
[cheering]

578
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,623
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): These
people were going nuts.

579
00:23:10,657 --> 00:23:11,524
They were applauding.

580
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:12,992
They were going crazy.

581
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:15,061
I don't feel that kind
of feeling when

582
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:17,063
I'm drilling a cavity.

583
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:19,165
It's when you're walking on
stage, and you've got 300

584
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:20,833
adoring fans go crazy
over you.

585
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,871
It was ama--

586
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,839
I was amazed.

587
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:28,140
I had no clue.

588
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:30,209
And then I knew it was--

589
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,578
there was something to this.

590
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:33,646
It was a cult phenomenon.

591
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,717
-Two decades after it was made,
"Troll 2" is finally

592
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,885
finding an audience.

593
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,053
And the fans are
not necessarily

594
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,655
all completely crazy.

595
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:48,728
-I'd always wanted to see "Troll
2" in a theater, but

596
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:49,996
I'd never thought
it would happen.

597
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:51,898
We had really hoped that
it would sell out.

598
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,667
But it actually ended up being
about over 100 people that

599
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:57,236
couldn't even make it
into the theater.

600
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,239
-I have never seen a line that
far around the Alamo.

601
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,240
It's crazy.

602
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,809
-It is sold out for tonight.

603
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:06,178
-This is unbelievable.

604
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:11,718
-This film is like aliens saw
what movies were like from our

605
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:14,487
transmissions, and then they
tried to make a film

606
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:16,088
themselves that Earthlings
would like.

607
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:27,667
-We'd all found "Troll
2" on our own.

608
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,069
We'd watch it every
single weekend.

609
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:34,073
-I saw it at least seven times
in the first week after being

610
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:35,542
introduced to it.

611
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:37,043
-Everyone had to become
obsessed with it.

612
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,244
We'd brainwashed them into it.

613
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:44,250
-My friends and I thought we
were like the only people in

614
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:46,052
the world who knew about this.

615
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:47,820
-Oh, my god.

616
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:50,657
-Getting to meet some of these
guys was really a pleasure.

617
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,659
And George Hardy, I think
I'll probably

618
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:53,860
stalk for several months.

619
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,030
-"Troll 2," ladies
and gentlemen.

620
00:24:58,064 --> 00:24:59,632
-Enjoy it.

621
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,634
[cheering]

622
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:05,605
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): Hey,
nice to meet you.

623
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:07,006
-I love you.

624
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:16,616
-If you're unhappy, just
watch "Troll 2."

625
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:19,586
-(CHANTING) "Troll 2,"
"Troll 2," "Troll 2."

626
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:20,987
-You're so awesome.

627
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:25,592
I brought the VHS, the original,
because I am a

628
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:27,594
goblin in disguise.

629
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:38,971
-I love "Troll 2!"

630
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:40,006
-Yeah!

631
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,574
-It's time to watch the movie.

632
00:25:41,608 --> 00:25:42,742
Come on in.

633
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:43,943
-And you can't piss
on hospitality.

634
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:44,944
I won't allow it!

635
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:46,946
-I won't allow it!

636
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:48,948
[cheering]

637
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:57,089
-You just never realize that it
reached as many people as

638
00:25:57,123 --> 00:25:57,924
it did.

639
00:25:57,957 --> 00:25:58,658
-Nice to meet you.

640
00:25:58,691 --> 00:25:59,058
Oh, my god.

641
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:01,928
Wow.

642
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:03,329
-It's the happiest
night of my life.

643
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:15,341
-Your friend and mine, the rich
man's Craig T Nelson,

644
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:16,943
George Hardy!

645
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:18,911
[applause]

646
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,287
-Mr. George Hardy!

647
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,289
[applause]

648
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,696
-What's weird though-- and it--
and it's the reason the

649
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:37,396
movie's great.

650
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,297
You guys are so genuine.

651
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,298
-He's so sincere.

652
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,667
He's so genuine.

653
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,269
He's exactly why we
love "Troll 2."

654
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:47,874
-I'm sure George Hardy is a
great dentist, but I respect

655
00:26:47,907 --> 00:26:49,075
him as an actor.

656
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:02,889
-You know the trouble with
being psychologically

657
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:06,726
disturbed is that
no matter how--

658
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:10,663
how you get out of it and get
back to normalcy, as soon as

659
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:14,200
you tell people you had mental
problems, they still treat you

660
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:15,401
like you're nutty.

661
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:22,274
I walked in ever decreasing
concentric circles until I

662
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:25,812
found my head up my ass.

663
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:29,882
I was sitting in my house on
13th East, and I couldn't

664
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:32,685
decide whether to have
a hard boiled egg, a

665
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:34,721
scrambled egg, or eggs.

666
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:36,923
I couldn't make that decision.

667
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:39,258
I was there, stuck.

668
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:42,061
And a friend said, let me take
you to the hospital.

669
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:46,032
And they took me right in.

670
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:48,801
You know, I like to drive
without a seat belt.

671
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:51,704
I really like the feeling of
driving without a seat belt.

672
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:59,345
I was in the mental hospital at
the University of Utah, and

673
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:02,214
they gave me days
off to go out.

674
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:03,916
I called my agent.

675
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,485
She said, they're shooting a
movie out in Park City, an

676
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,287
Italian film company.

677
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,922
And you go out there.

678
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:11,958
I won't charge you if
you get the part.

679
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:13,092
I went there.

680
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,127
They said, come back again.

681
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:17,029
And when I came back, they
said, the person who was

682
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:19,131
supposed to do it
didn't show up.

683
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:20,332
So you can do it.

684
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,275
-Can I help you?

685
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:30,943
-Coffee.

686
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:32,444
-There's no coffee
here in Nilbog.

687
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:35,481
It's the devil's drink.

688
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:37,283
-Eggs.

689
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:39,285
-[grunts]

690
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:42,088
-You know, this is me.

691
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:44,390
This is who I am.

692
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:46,058
It's--

693
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:48,360
you know, it's-- you know a lot
about people by the-- by

694
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:51,397
the toys they have.

695
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,799
These are my people.

696
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:56,302
These are my people.

697
00:28:58,805 --> 00:29:01,373
If they were to run for office,
I'd vote for them.

698
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:05,277
I smoked an enormous amount
of pot then to stay sane.

699
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:08,214
And when I got on the set, I had
no idea what it all meant

700
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,449
or what I was doing or
what I was saying.

701
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,451
I don't know where we
went or what we did.

702
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:16,388
And I have no idea of what
the total movie was.

703
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:20,092
And I didn't see it until
20 years later.

704
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:24,964
And I was amazed how
creepy I looked.

705
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:29,068
I looked at that person,
who looked like this.

706
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,537
And I realized I was
really troubled.

707
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,906
I wasn't acting, I could
tell you that.

708
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,174
I wasn't acting.

709
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:38,477
That was a troubled
person talking.

710
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:41,547
It was a terrible experience,
making that movie.

711
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,249
It was always cold.

712
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,051
It was always remote.

713
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:48,587
And I remember there was a
little kid there, a little

714
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,423
Mormon kid who was really
a pain in the ass.

715
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:54,861
And he was the star, and
I wanted to kill him.

716
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:57,997
And I was in the scene with him
where I said, try this.

717
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,431
You'll like it.

718
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,868
And I really wanted to feed
him that green stuff.

719
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:04,837
I wanted to grab his head
and put it in it.

720
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:06,605
I just couldn't stand him.

721
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,212
The dentist, the one who played
the father was the

722
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:16,048
Southern accent, called me.

723
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:17,850
That's how I found
out about it.

724
00:30:17,884 --> 00:30:19,018
I was in the audience.

725
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:21,153
I didn't want to go
up on the stage.

726
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:24,256
-Don Packard showed up and was
sitting in the audience.

727
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,925
-Yeah.

728
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:27,026
He wasn't even, like,
necessarily wanting to be part

729
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,160
of the Q&A.

730
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:29,595
-We had to, like,
go and ask him.

731
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,363
And he was like, oh, you want
me to-- oh, uh, OK.

732
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:33,866
-Like, you flew to New York
just to watch this?

733
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,503
-And the woman sitting next to
me said, you were great.

734
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:38,871
She kept saying,
you were great.

735
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:39,438
I--

736
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:40,439
I was won over.

737
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,041
-This is pretty incredible.

738
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:43,275
I'm pretty giddy about it.

739
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:45,978
Would the owner of the
general store--

740
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:47,980
[cheering]

741
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:53,419
-And I--

742
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:54,921
I just--

743
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:56,455
I went like this, and
everybody applauded.

744
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:58,090
I was thrilled.

745
00:30:58,124 --> 00:30:59,225
I went like this.

746
00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:01,527
They all applauded
when I came out.

747
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,097
And somehow, I was freed.

748
00:31:05,131 --> 00:31:06,565
I wasn't self conscious.

749
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:09,668
It was really a golden
experience for me.

750
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:22,048
I never felt that good in
all my life, really.

751
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:26,052
I never was thrilled at being
who I was until that moment

752
00:31:26,085 --> 00:31:27,253
in-- in Manhattan.

753
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:40,232
-Hello, my name is Mr. K. I'm
somewhere here in Austria in

754
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:42,001
the middle of the woods.

755
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:44,070
I'm not just cold,
I'm freezing.

756
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:46,005
And I'm a troll.

757
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:46,973
What else?

758
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:48,507
I'm going to eat you.

759
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,410
[growls]

760
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:55,181
-My name is Kacper Radecki I'm
a "Troll 2" fan, and I live

761
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:56,415
here in Austria.

762
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:59,485
My desk in school is
full of "Troll 2."

763
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:05,091
-I'm so excited that a movie can
mean that much to people

764
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:07,293
without being pushed into it.

765
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:09,728
The-- the audiences of
"Troll 2" had to have

766
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,363
found it on their own.

767
00:32:11,397 --> 00:32:15,267
They had to be probably a
certain type of person who

768
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:21,473
would rent videos that they've
never heard of and someone who

769
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:23,976
watches movies more than once.

770
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,212
-"Troll 2" is something
very special.

771
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:29,115
It's a movie you can watch
1,000 times, and

772
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:30,149
it won't get boring.

773
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:32,985
It's just so perfectly bad.

774
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:36,755
-I realized there's nothing more
intelligent that I could

775
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,326
do as a 31-year-old man than
get a "Troll 2" tattoo.

776
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,298
-I can't stand tattoos.

777
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:47,499
But--

778
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,172
JESSE (OFFSCREEN): It's
so interactive.

779
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:55,541
You, um, personalize the film.

780
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:58,510
And you take some sort
of ownership.

781
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:01,080
-We bought a kit to make
actually like a profession

782
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:02,048
latex mask.

783
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:03,182
-Yeah, we like--

784
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:04,216
-It's the first time,
you know.

785
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,084
We'd never sculpted anything.

786
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:06,252
-We'd never done it.

787
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:07,219
I've never sculpted
any clay before.

788
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,259
-It took about six weeks
to complete.

789
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:15,061
We didn't know how it was going
to turn out, you know,

790
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:17,196
being the first time we
made these costumes.

791
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:19,731
-It turned out really well.

792
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:22,668
-If I could get everyone's
attention, we're going to

793
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:24,436
start the Trollympic game.

794
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,806
So any-- everyone who wants to
participate, just come over

795
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:28,407
here.

796
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,408
-Go!

797
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:33,379
-I would always invite
people over to watch

798
00:33:33,412 --> 00:33:34,780
"Troll 2" with me.

799
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,648
So I don't know if that would
count as a party.

800
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:39,251
But actual, like, official
"Troll 2" parties--

801
00:33:39,285 --> 00:33:40,452
this is my third.

802
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:48,727
-Hi, my name's Adam Kourelis.

803
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,298
I'm the one that brought
"Troll 2" to Iraq.

804
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:55,267
-What I learned from this movie
is that whenever someone

805
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:57,269
goes like this towards me, I--

806
00:33:57,303 --> 00:33:58,437
I--

807
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,271
I won't eat whatever
they give me.

808
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:04,376
-I basically made the
"Troll 2" video game

809
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,745
because I love the movie.

810
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:07,779
And I just--

811
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:09,548
I wanted to make a good game.

812
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:10,316
All right.

813
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:11,483
We're at Nilbog.

814
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:13,485
I'm shooting double
decker baloney

815
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:16,155
sandwiches at the goblins.

816
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:18,324
These are the strong ones.

817
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:19,658
Yeah.

818
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:23,229
-My friend Steve, also
a venue artist here--

819
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:26,165
I showed him "Troll 2" probably
about like a year and

820
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:28,667
a half ago, right around the
time we were starting "Guitar

821
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,837
Hero II." And he made, you know,
one of his levels the

822
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:32,871
high school gym.

823
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,473
And he called it Nilbog High.

824
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:36,342
You know, and we-- we all
that thought was great.

825
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:41,147
-I actually wrote the, uh,
sequel, "Troll 2, Monstrous

826
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,682
Beings." This is a
close figure on

827
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:44,616
the side of the road.

828
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,751
Michael gets on the CB.

829
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,519
And he says, hey,
son, to Elliott.

830
00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:48,754
Elliott says, yes, dad.

831
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:49,521
I hate--

832
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:51,257
I hate to see--

833
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,559
-If this movie is resonating so
strongly with all of these

834
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,295
people, what is beneath the
surface that is this kind of

835
00:34:56,328 --> 00:35:01,300
unconscious thing that is
getting under our skin?

836
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,469
-I don't think it's the
worst film ever made.

837
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:06,638
I have seen worse
films than this.

838
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:08,474
But it's--

839
00:35:08,507 --> 00:35:09,641
it's not necessarily
that it's bad.

840
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:10,609
It's odd.

841
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:11,543
It's really odd.

842
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:13,312
It doesn't make sense.

843
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:16,148
And it's like, a lot of bad
movies, you get the impression

844
00:35:16,182 --> 00:35:16,882
that people that make them
just didn't know

845
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:18,617
how to make a film.

846
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,553
This is like the people knew
how to make a film but had

847
00:35:21,587 --> 00:35:23,555
suffered quite a heavy
blow to the head.

848
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:25,491
-When the time comes,
you light the wick

849
00:35:25,524 --> 00:35:27,226
and throw the bottle.

850
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:29,461
I'll create some confusion
with this.

851
00:35:29,495 --> 00:35:31,230
JESSE (OFFSCREEN):
It's genuine.

852
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:36,702
There's no irony going on, a
film that genuinely expresses

853
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:41,473
a story, a totally whacked
story too.

854
00:35:41,507 --> 00:35:44,310
-There's sandwiches for
tonight in here.

855
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:48,380
It will go easier
if you eat them.

856
00:35:48,414 --> 00:35:52,218
-The best bad movies are not
deliberately bad, always.

857
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:55,187
You know, like, the most fondly
remembered stinkers are

858
00:35:55,221 --> 00:35:57,723
the movies that people went all
out, and they tried their

859
00:35:57,756 --> 00:35:59,291
best and totally failed,
but gloriously.

860
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:05,664
-What we want from a film
is honesty and--

861
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:07,366
and sincerity.

862
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:08,734
We want to feel like these
people really care about what

863
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:10,869
they're making, even if
it is really awful.

864
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:14,773
That's why Ed Wood is still so
highly regarded, because Ed

865
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:16,708
Wood wasn't just making trash.

866
00:36:16,742 --> 00:36:19,211
He really believed in
what he was making.

867
00:36:19,245 --> 00:36:20,446
And that makes a
big difference.

868
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:21,980
You know, I see some
of these films.

869
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:22,848
And I think, these are people
who have just thrown this

870
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:24,316
together cynically.

871
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:34,393
But there isn't a cynicism
in "Troll 2."

872
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:44,403
But there isn't a cynicism
in "Troll 2."

-Oh, boy.

00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:23,982
What attention, what suspense.

880
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:35,927
-It's Claudio.

881
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:39,230
Scott, I want to
introduce you.

882
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:40,065
Scott, Claudio.

883
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:40,932
-How are you?

884
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:41,533
Nice to meet you.

885
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:42,067
-Good.

886
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:42,901
How are you?

887
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:43,669
-Fine.

888
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:44,636
-It's an honor.

889
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,772
I'm a huge fan, huge fan.

890
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:49,107
I saw this movie
when I was 15.

891
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,075
-No.

892
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:51,209
-Yeah.

893
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,844
Now, um, I produce
horror movies.

894
00:41:52,878 --> 00:41:56,915
So it's amazing.

895
00:41:56,948 --> 00:41:59,250
-Yes.

896
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:00,819
-Yes, absolutely.

897
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,187
-So good to see you again.

898
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:02,954
-I remember.

899
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:03,822
-Oh, of course.

900
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,223
Of course.

901
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,192
Yes, you yelled at me a lot.

902
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:08,193
-Oh, Chris.

903
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:09,595
-Do you remember me?

904
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:14,700
-So we're all here.

905
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:16,101
It's pretty great.

906
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:18,103
-In LA, yeah?

907
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:20,939
-Yeah, right here
in Los Angeles.

908
00:42:20,972 --> 00:42:21,907
-That's it, yeah.

909
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:22,908
You're right in it.

910
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:24,109
You're right here.

911
00:42:28,146 --> 00:42:30,782
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): This is
pretty good, pretty good.

912
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:31,850
-Hello, how are you?

913
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:32,618
Fine.

914
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:33,785
-How you doing?

915
00:42:33,819 --> 00:42:35,687
-Have you seen this
movie before?

916
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:36,121
-Yeah.

917
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:37,088
Yeah.

918
00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:37,856
-What you think about it?

919
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:38,857
-What was that?

920
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,225
-What do you think about it?

921
00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:41,793
-Oh, we have a great time
watching this movie.

922
00:42:41,827 --> 00:42:43,061
Oh, yeah.

923
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:43,829
-Ciao.

924
00:42:43,862 --> 00:42:45,631
Bye, bye.

925
00:42:45,664 --> 00:42:47,365
-"Troll 2." Yeah.

926
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,767
-Did you see the movie?

927
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,868
-Yeah, it was awesome.

928
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,136
-What do you think about it?

929
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:52,070
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
It's amazing.

930
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:53,071
-It's amazing?

931
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:54,072
-It's a miracle.

932
00:42:54,105 --> 00:42:55,641
I love it. "Troll 2." Woo!

-Grandpa Seth has been gone for
more than six months now.

934
00:43:19,064 --> 00:43:21,900
You were at the funeral,
and I know it was very

935
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,301
difficult for you.

936
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:26,738
It was also very difficult
for your father and for

937
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:28,707
Holly and for me--

[laughter]

939
00:44:10,448 --> 00:44:14,352
-Every single bad movie out
there wants to be this film.

940
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:18,456
It wants to be "Troll 2." Most
bad movies only have, like,

941
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,693
two redeeming qualities or a
couple of scenes you share

942
00:44:21,727 --> 00:44:22,961
with your friends.

943
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:25,296
The thing with "Troll
2," it delivers

944
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,198
through the entire film.

945
00:44:27,232 --> 00:44:28,867

believe, of the cast here.

the movie called "Troll 2"

00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:14,145

trolls in the film?

MICHAEL (OFFSCREEN): How does
it feel that you were the

957
00:45:49,848 --> 00:45:52,083
director of the worst
movie ever made?

958
00:45:52,117 --> 00:45:55,053
-I feel I didn't do
the worst movie.

959
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:57,422
I did a very good movie.

960
00:45:57,455 --> 00:46:03,929
If they all say, worst
movie, ah, them

961
00:46:03,962 --> 00:46:05,563
problem, not my problem.

962
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,967
My problem is to shoot
a lot of movies.

963
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,869
I want to shoot a
lot of movies.

964
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:11,970
I can't--

965
00:46:12,003 --> 00:46:13,171
I can't stop.

[country music playing]

967
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,343
-The old house is pretty much
the same thing, except it's

968
00:46:52,377 --> 00:46:55,113
run down a lot more.

969
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:57,983
But it was run down
quite a bit then.

970
00:46:58,016 --> 00:47:00,118
-They picked the right house.

971
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:02,220
-I guarantee you, there's some
mental insanity here, some

00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:04,022
mental insanity.

973
00:47:04,055 --> 00:47:12,964
So this is really the perfect
spot for "Troll 2." I

ROBERT (OFFSCREEN):
How are you doing?

976
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,469
-And I come out and kind
of go, oh, god.

977
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:20,305
And then I go--

978
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:21,506
and for some reason--

979
00:47:28,113 --> 00:47:30,348
-OK, OK.

980
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:32,017
-How-- question.

981
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:34,986
I can remember sitting down with
Michael and Connie and

982
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,355
Margo, and we would
take the script.

983
00:47:37,388 --> 00:47:40,325
And we would try to decipher
what it meant.

984
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:45,330
We would sit there for hours,
looking at this script and try

985
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:47,465
to do, you know, an analysis
on the scenes.

986
00:47:47,498 --> 00:47:49,200
And we couldn't do it.

987
00:47:49,234 --> 00:47:52,670
How did I know that there was
a fire extinguisher right

988
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,039
there the whole time?

989
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,212
-And I thought, well,
this guy's famous.

990
00:48:01,246 --> 00:48:02,948
He knows what the
hell he's doing.

991
00:48:02,981 --> 00:48:04,382
And I mean, I was
just, whatever.

992
00:48:04,415 --> 00:48:05,516
You know?

[laughing]

994
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:09,520

in front of the house--

995
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:11,356
Connie and I-- during
our break.

996
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:12,590
And we were looking
at this script.

997
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:14,459
And she said, I'm really
uncomfortable

998
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:16,261
with the nuts line.

999
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:19,630
We came up with something that
was, uh, we thought, more PG.

1000
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:21,699
Then we tracked down Claudio,
and we said, Claudio, we

1001
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,335
really think this will
work better.

1002
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:25,503
It's a little more PG.

1003
00:48:25,536 --> 00:48:27,105
This is how American
teenagers talk.

1004
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:30,641
And he said, I know how American
teenagers talk.

1005
00:48:30,675 --> 00:48:33,044
This is how American
teenagers talk.

1006
00:48:33,078 --> 00:48:34,079
-That's not how you do that.

1007
00:48:34,112 --> 00:48:35,246
That's not American.

1008
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,481
And he would always
say that to me.

1009
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:38,016
I don't know if he said
that to you a lot.

1010
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:39,985
But he would always tell
me what was American.

[music playing]

1012
00:48:49,394 --> 00:48:51,496
-There was a lot of times I've
seen they were trying to add

1013
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:54,365
something or trying to make
it seem a little bit

1014
00:48:54,399 --> 00:48:55,533
more natural to us.

1015
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:58,203
But it-- it--

1016
00:48:58,236 --> 00:49:02,173
he had a real-- you know, had
a real vision of what he

1017
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,508
wanted to see.

1018
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:06,544
-Michael, who are the goblins?

1019
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:07,445
No, no, I say--

00:49:07,478 --> 00:49:08,113
-Who are the goblins?

1021
00:49:08,146 --> 00:49:09,014
-I say--

1022
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:10,281
I say like, Michael--

1023
00:49:13,484 --> 00:49:15,486
you can-- you are an actor.

1024
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,221
You cannot laugh.

1025
00:49:16,254 --> 00:49:16,754
-OK.

1026
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:17,455
I will not.

1027
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:18,356
I will not.

1028
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:19,124
-You must be serious.

1029
00:49:19,157 --> 00:49:19,657
OK?

1030
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:20,625
-All right.

1031
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:24,229
-Say, who are the goblins?

1032
00:49:24,262 --> 00:49:25,430
-The goblins?

1033
00:49:35,273 --> 00:49:37,508
-That was nice.

1034
00:49:37,542 --> 00:49:40,545
-For the goblins, they weren't
looking for talent.

1035
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:43,514
You know, we didn't even have
to match the brilliant level

1036
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:45,716
of acting that was going on
in the rest of the film.

1037
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,085
They just--

1038
00:49:47,118 --> 00:49:48,153
they were just looking
at heights.

1039
00:49:48,186 --> 00:49:49,587
-I remember them
putting this--

1040
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:53,491
almost like a burlap
bag shirt on us.

1041
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:55,193
And they put gloves on us.

1042
00:49:55,226 --> 00:49:59,230
And the gloves were way
longer than my hands.

1043
00:49:59,264 --> 00:50:03,701
And so they kind of would tape
them on to the burlap bag.

1044
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:06,371
I had no clue what the
movie was about.

1045
00:50:06,404 --> 00:50:09,074
-It was kind of hard to get a
straight answer as to exactly

1046
00:50:09,107 --> 00:50:11,709
what the nature of
the project was.

1047
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:13,544
But we were excited.

1048
00:50:13,578 --> 00:50:15,213
We were told it was
low budget.

1049
00:50:15,246 --> 00:50:18,049
But, you know, we-- we know that
low budget is kind of a

1050
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:19,350
relative term.

1051
00:50:19,384 --> 00:50:21,119
After a few days, we
realized this was

1052
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:23,421
really, really low budget.

1053
00:50:23,454 --> 00:50:27,592
And by, I think it was probably
three days into

1054
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:28,759
shooting that we kind of--

1055
00:50:28,793 --> 00:50:30,361
-You will remember
the director.

1056
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:31,096
-Yes.

1057
00:50:31,129 --> 00:50:32,330
Oh, Claudio.

1058
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:34,065
-How are you?

1059
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:36,201
-As we started shooting more
and more, it started to get

1060
00:50:36,234 --> 00:50:38,469
more confusing rather
than less.

1061
00:50:38,503 --> 00:50:41,739
And it was like each day we were
on the set, we knew less

1062
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:44,075
about what this movie was
actually supposed to be.

1063
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:47,212
-And action.

1064
00:50:47,245 --> 00:50:48,413
-You see this writing?

on, say the line!

1068
00:50:58,656 --> 00:50:59,790
Hospitality!

1069
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:06,731
And you can't piss
on hospitality.

1070

I won't allow it!

do to me, daddy?

00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,302
-OK, Joshua.

1073
00:51:11,336 --> 00:51:12,870
You want to know what it feels
like to have hunger pains?

1074
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,406
Well, I'm tightening my belt
buckle by one notch so I don't

1075
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,375
feel hunger pains.

1077
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:19,677
-No, no.

Be serious.

1079
00:51:20,711 --> 00:51:22,313
Repeat.

1080
00:51:22,347 --> 00:51:24,715
-There was a recurring problem
on the set that was this

1081
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:27,418
language barrier that we
all had to deal with.

1082
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:28,653
-One of the Italian ADs--

1083

-Right.

to be following me

upstairs now.

1086
00:51:34,292 --> 00:51:35,560
And we were out there in the
middle of the canyon.

1087
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:36,694
There was no--

1088
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:37,828
there were no stairs
or anything.

1089
00:51:37,862 --> 00:51:39,297
I mean, just going
up this slope.

action, you come, and you do.

00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:54,445
You go around.

1092
00:51:54,479 --> 00:51:56,614
Go around, and after,
you come up.

1093
00:51:56,647 --> 00:51:57,748
OK.

1094
00:51:57,782 --> 00:52:00,251
We start with one
with the other.

1095
00:52:00,285 --> 00:52:01,152
Oh, eat.

1096
00:52:01,186 --> 00:52:02,420
Oh, finally, we can eat.

1097
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,254
Oh, OK.

1098
00:52:03,288 --> 00:52:04,755
Blah, blah, blah.

GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): Claudio
speaks a lot better English

1100
00:52:07,692 --> 00:52:09,394
than he did 18 years ago.

1101
00:52:09,427 --> 00:52:10,528
I mean, there was no way we
could understand things like

1102
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:11,762
that last time he
worked with us.

1103

-I--

1104
00:52:13,498 --> 00:52:15,900
I really couldn't understand
what they wanted me to do.

1105
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:17,568
-Open, open, open.

1106
00:52:17,602 --> 00:52:18,469
Come on, come on.

1107
00:52:18,503 --> 00:52:19,270
Open and say the line.

1108
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:19,904
Say the line.

1109
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:21,272
Say the line.

1110
00:52:21,306 --> 00:52:23,374
-The Italians did kind
of annoy me.

1111
00:52:23,408 --> 00:52:24,675
They're really intense.

1112
00:52:24,709 --> 00:52:28,546
They were really intense
people, very bossy.

1113
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:31,382
I feel about as confused as I
did when we were doing it.

00:52:31,416 --> 00:52:32,250
-Come on.

1115
00:52:32,283 --> 00:52:32,883
Don't talk with me.

1116
00:52:32,917 --> 00:52:33,718
There is a camera.

1117
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:34,885
Don't laugh.

1118
00:52:34,919 --> 00:52:36,487
Stay serious.

1119
00:52:36,521 --> 00:52:38,423
-I had a yellow shirt, and
it had a logo on it and

1120
00:52:38,456 --> 00:52:39,857
a logo on the back.

1121
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:41,859
But halfway through filming,
they lost my shirt.

1122
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:44,829
And we'd already filmed like
half of my scenes.

1123
00:52:44,862 --> 00:52:46,331
And so they're like,
oh, that's fine.

1124
00:52:46,364 --> 00:52:47,898
Go buy a yellow shirt.

1125
00:52:47,932 --> 00:52:49,867
And I was just like, you want
me to buy the yellow shirt?

1126
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,869
I'm like, isn't there
like someone to go

1127
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:53,204
buy the yellow shirt?

1128
00:52:53,238 --> 00:52:54,239
Isn't there someone
in wardrobe?

1129
00:52:54,272 --> 00:52:54,939
They're like, no.

1130
00:52:54,972 --> 00:52:56,341
Go buy a yellow shirt.

1131
00:52:56,374 --> 00:52:57,542
-They took my shoes--

1132
00:52:57,575 --> 00:53:00,745
mind you, my shoes, not
theirs, my black

1133
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:02,547
Converse high tops.

1134
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:05,950
And they screwed them into the
base of the pot, where I stood

1135
00:53:05,983 --> 00:53:08,619
for almost 14 hours
in make up.

1136
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:32,009
-We really were trying
to make a good movie.

1137
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,411
We really were.

1138
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:37,415
Um, it just didn't turn
out that way.

1139
00:53:37,448 --> 00:53:40,618
-I've always loved bad movies.

1140
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:42,453
And I always thought,
god, it'd be great

1141
00:53:42,487 --> 00:53:43,988
to be in a bad movie.

1142
00:53:44,021 --> 00:53:47,392
But I had no idea when I was
making it that I was making

1143
00:53:47,425 --> 00:53:48,993
that bad a movie.

1144
00:53:49,026 --> 00:53:52,830
So it's wonderful to find out
that yeah, I made a bad movie,

1145
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:56,000
a really bad movie that
got to be famous.

1146
00:54:00,671 --> 00:54:02,307
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): This
is very familiar.

1147
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:05,410
You go up here and take a right,
go off to the right.

1148
00:54:05,443 --> 00:54:07,945
I remember when I filmed "Troll
2," I would go pick up

1149
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:11,649
Margo and take her to the set.

1150
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:16,654
And so I kind of remember a
little bit of where she lives.

1151
00:54:16,687 --> 00:54:22,827
It says, no trespassing except
for US mail, no dogs, no

1152
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,329
literature.

1153
00:54:24,362 --> 00:54:26,331
Do not ring the bell except
by documented

1154
00:54:26,364 --> 00:54:27,898
request by the owner.

1155
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:31,702
Violators will be prosecuted.

1156
00:54:31,736 --> 00:54:33,304
Wow.

1157
00:54:33,338 --> 00:54:33,871
Oh, god.

1158
00:54:33,904 --> 00:54:34,705
This is crazy.

1159
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:35,540
What in the world?

1160
00:54:35,573 --> 00:54:36,807
What are we doing?

1161
00:54:36,841 --> 00:54:38,509
-What's the worst thing
that could happen?

1162
00:54:38,543 --> 00:54:40,077
-That she comes to the door
with a gun, or she shoots

1163
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,879
through the door with a gun.

1164
00:54:41,912 --> 00:54:43,481
I mean, she could have
mental issues.

1165
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:45,082
A bullet comes through
the door.

1166
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,951
-George, don't say that.

1167
00:54:46,984 --> 00:54:48,919
-Well, that's the worst
that can happen.

1168
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:49,954
MICHAEL (OFFSCREEN):
You want to do it?

1169
00:54:49,987 --> 00:54:50,988
-Yeah, it's like pulling
a tooth.

1170
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:51,922
Let's just go ahead and do it.

1171
00:54:59,664 --> 00:55:01,432
MARGO (OFFSCREEN): Who is it?

1172
00:55:01,466 --> 00:55:03,734
-It's Michael and--
and George Hardy.

1173
00:55:03,768 --> 00:55:04,935
We--

1174
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:06,671
is it you, Margo?

1175
00:55:06,704 --> 00:55:07,405
MARGO (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

1176
00:55:07,438 --> 00:55:07,938
-Hey, Margo.

1177
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:08,939
It's George.

1178
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:10,908
I was in "Troll 2" with you.

1179
00:55:10,941 --> 00:55:11,642
-Hey.

1180
00:55:11,676 --> 00:55:12,377
It's Margo.

1181
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:13,344
-Hey, Margo.

1182
00:55:13,378 --> 00:55:14,044
MARGO (OFFSCREEN): Oh, hi.

1183
00:55:14,078 --> 00:55:15,646
What are you doing here?

1184
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,514
-We--

1185
00:55:16,547 --> 00:55:17,014
we are--

1186
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:18,048
we came--

1187
00:55:18,082 --> 00:55:18,783
George actually came in front.

1188
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:19,917
I'm Michael.

1189
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:20,818
I played your son
in the movie.

1190
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:21,419
MARGO (OFFSCREEN): Hi.

1191
00:55:21,452 --> 00:55:22,387
Hi.

1192
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:23,020
-Do you remember Michael?

1193
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:23,921
-Do you remember?

1194
00:55:23,954 --> 00:55:24,555
MARGO (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

1195
00:55:24,589 --> 00:55:25,556
-Yeah.

1196
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:26,591
And I-- do you remember me?

1197
00:55:26,624 --> 00:55:27,358
MARGO (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, I do.

1198
00:55:27,392 --> 00:55:28,359
-How are you?

1199
00:55:28,393 --> 00:55:28,893
MARGO (OFFSCREEN): I'm good.

1200
00:55:28,926 --> 00:55:29,527
How are you?

1201
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,828
-Good.

1202
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:31,429
MARGO (OFFSCREEN): You
just came to say hi?

1203
00:55:31,462 --> 00:55:31,862
-Yeah.

1204
00:55:31,896 --> 00:55:32,830
We did.

1205
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,598
MARGO (OFFSCREEN): Crazy.

1206
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,465
-I don't know--

1207
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:34,899
I know, it is crazy.

1208
00:55:34,932 --> 00:55:35,933
-We--

1209
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:37,034
I don't know if you've known--

1210
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:38,769
-We've been trying
to find you.

1211
00:55:38,803 --> 00:55:39,537
You're the last one of all of
our cast members to find.

1212
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:40,505
We couldn't--

1213
00:55:40,538 --> 00:55:41,406
of the major cast members.

1214
00:55:41,439 --> 00:55:42,407
We couldn't find you.

1215
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,908
So now, are you working now?

1216
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:46,110
Or are you-- are you doing
auditions for anything now?

1217
00:55:46,143 --> 00:55:47,512
Or--

1218
00:55:47,545 --> 00:55:49,079
-Well, I haven't been
auditioning in

1219
00:55:49,113 --> 00:55:51,982
the last, like, year.

1220
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:55,052
I don't really have an
agent right now.

1221
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:56,921
I did have one.

1222
00:55:56,954 --> 00:55:59,089
You know, I'm just kind of
like edging into it.

1223
00:55:59,123 --> 00:56:03,394
I'm waiting for things in my
life to kind of settle down a

1224
00:56:03,428 --> 00:56:03,828
little bit.

1225
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:05,463
-Sure.

1226
00:56:05,496 --> 00:56:10,435
-Because I just-- it's
complicated now for me to do

1227
00:56:10,468 --> 00:56:10,968
things.

1228
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:11,869
-Sure, yeah.

1229
00:56:11,902 --> 00:56:12,870
-It's just complicated.

1230
00:56:12,903 --> 00:56:14,171
It's just complicated.

1231
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:17,007
I learn all the time new
things about acting.

1232
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,877
Even though I may not be acting
every single day or

1233
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:24,982
doing parts every single day,
I watch movies, and I take

1234
00:56:25,015 --> 00:56:27,752
mental notes about what I
liked about what those

1235
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:29,420
characters are doing.

1236
00:56:29,454 --> 00:56:31,055
And very often, I write it down
on a piece of paper and

1237
00:56:31,088 --> 00:56:33,424
stick it on my mirror
in my bedroom.

1238
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:35,593
And then I look at it,
you know, until it

1239
00:56:35,626 --> 00:56:36,927
sinks into my head.

1240
00:56:36,961 --> 00:56:37,928
Hold on.

1241
00:56:37,962 --> 00:56:38,896
Let me get a drink of water.

1242
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:39,864
Let me get you some water.

1243
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:41,165
There's some warm water.

1244
00:56:41,198 --> 00:56:42,800
That will help you
out a little bit.

1245
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:44,735
OK.

1246
00:56:44,769 --> 00:56:46,537
Taking care of my
mother is easy.

1247
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:47,872
She's easy.

1248
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:51,842
I feel sad for her having
to not be able to

1249
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:53,644
use one of her legs.

1250
00:56:53,678 --> 00:56:55,880
I feel sad for her because she's
always been acting her

1251
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:56,881
whole entire life.

1252
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:58,683
You doing OK?

1253
00:56:58,716 --> 00:57:00,451
We're going to have dinner
pretty soon.

1254
00:57:00,485 --> 00:57:01,919
They're almost done.

1255
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:04,154
This has lasted quite a lot
longer than I thought.

1256
00:57:04,188 --> 00:57:04,989
-Yes.

1257
00:57:05,022 --> 00:57:06,491
-Yeah.

1258
00:57:06,524 --> 00:57:07,858
But we're going to have
dinner pretty soon.

1259
00:57:07,892 --> 00:57:08,893
And then we'll-- we'll get
ready to go to bed.

1260
00:57:17,635 --> 00:57:22,039
I just made it me.

1261
00:57:22,072 --> 00:57:28,846
I just did it the way I would
do it because I felt that we

1262
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:31,516
were just like one
person, you know?

1263
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:34,485
And I could just take the words
and let them come out of

1264
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:36,887
my mouth just the way
I would do it.

1265
00:57:36,921 --> 00:57:39,790
And so it became a really
simple thing.

1266
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:41,859
-Joshua, start singing.

1267
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:42,893
Come on.

1268
00:57:42,927 --> 00:57:44,028
Sing that song I like so much.

1269
00:57:44,061 --> 00:57:46,230
-I don't feel like
singing, mom.

1270
00:57:46,263 --> 00:57:48,198
-Just sing.

1271
00:57:48,232 --> 00:57:52,002
-(SINGING) Row, row, row your
boat, gently down the stream.

1272
00:57:52,036 --> 00:57:53,871
-(SINGING) Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily,

1273
00:57:53,904 --> 00:57:55,606
life is but a dream.

1274
00:57:55,640 --> 00:58:00,244
-I remember you crying out in
that voice that just sent

1275
00:58:00,277 --> 00:58:02,513
shudders through my spine.

1276
00:58:02,547 --> 00:58:06,116
(WHISPERING) Mom, mom.

1277
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:08,085
-They're eating my mom.

1278
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:20,097
-And I really believed that
you had lost your mother.

1279
00:58:25,903 --> 00:58:27,071
It was great.

1280
00:58:29,974 --> 00:58:32,109
I don't really feel sad that
I never had children.

1281
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:33,611
It's not that I don't
like children.

1282
00:58:33,644 --> 00:58:35,179
I like children.

1283
00:58:35,212 --> 00:58:40,117
But I really don't think that
I could be a real life mom.

1284
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:43,921
Joshua, sing that song
I like so much.

1285
00:58:43,954 --> 00:58:46,123
-But mom, I don't feel
like singing.

1286
00:58:46,156 --> 00:58:49,159
-Come on, sing.

1287
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:51,962
-(SINGING) Row, row, row
your boat, gently--

1288
00:58:51,996 --> 00:58:53,864
[laughing]

1289
00:58:53,898 --> 00:58:56,901
-Why can't-- are you laughing
at my voice?

1290
00:58:56,934 --> 00:58:58,836
-No, I'm laughing
at me because--

1291
00:58:58,869 --> 00:58:59,837
[laughing]

1292
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,271
-I know.

1293
00:59:01,305 --> 00:59:05,175
That's what the choir
instructor did.

1294
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:07,344
-I just never imagined
we'd be doing this.

1295
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,245
OK.

1296
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:09,714
You ready?

1297
00:59:09,747 --> 00:59:11,081
Let's do it again.

1298
00:59:11,115 --> 00:59:12,617
[SINGING IN ROUNDS - "ROW,
ROW, ROW YOUR BOAT"]

1299
00:59:22,693 --> 00:59:25,663
-After I watched the movie, and
I saw it, and it was over,

1300
00:59:25,696 --> 00:59:27,331
and I turned off the TV,
I just sat back.

1301
00:59:27,364 --> 00:59:29,834
And I said, wow,
this is great.

1302
00:59:29,867 --> 00:59:30,901
This is really great.

1303
00:59:30,935 --> 00:59:32,336
It was really good.

1304
00:59:32,369 --> 00:59:38,208
It's a simple, elegant, down
to earth, real, natural,

1305
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:39,944
actor, actor movie.

1306
00:59:39,977 --> 00:59:43,313
You know, most of the movies
that are around now are fast

1307
00:59:43,347 --> 00:59:47,652
paced and car chases and car
crashes and explosions and

1308
00:59:47,685 --> 00:59:51,789
fires and murders and blood
and gore and killing.

1309
00:59:51,822 --> 00:59:55,025
But you compare our movie to a
Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey

1310
00:59:55,059 --> 01:00:01,766
Bogart movie, and it fits in
because our movie was all

1311
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:05,670
about people and the experiences
those people were

1312
01:00:05,703 --> 01:00:10,107
experiencing, just as
"Casablanca" and those movies

1313
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:13,043
are about people and the
experiences they're

1314
01:00:13,077 --> 01:00:14,845
experiencing.

1315
01:00:14,879 --> 01:00:15,980
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): Well,
I was ready to go.

1316
01:00:16,013 --> 01:00:17,247
I was ready to get
the heck out.

1317
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:19,717
And so I kept putting
my jacket on.

1318
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:22,019
And the old grandmother goes,
(RASPY VOICE) it ain't going

1319
01:00:22,052 --> 01:00:23,754
to do you any good to
put the jacket on.

1320
01:00:23,788 --> 01:00:25,155
That ain't going to make
them leave any earlier.

1321
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:30,828
It was just a strange day.

1322
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:32,429
So I don't want to
ever do it again.

1323
01:00:48,412 --> 01:00:49,714
Hey, how you doing?

1324
01:00:49,747 --> 01:00:50,147
-Fine.

1325
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:50,915
-Good.

1326
01:00:50,948 --> 01:00:51,682
I'm Dr. Hardy.

1327
01:00:51,716 --> 01:00:52,850
How you been?

1328
01:00:52,883 --> 01:00:53,450
You don't know who I--

1329
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,318
-Oh, yeah.

1330
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:55,052
You're the troll.

1331
01:00:55,085 --> 01:00:55,786
-That's right.

1332
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:56,687
You know it.

1333
01:00:56,721 --> 01:00:57,454
Have you seen the movie?

1334
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:58,322
-No.

1335
01:00:58,355 --> 01:00:58,956
-You hadn't seen it?

1336
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,090
-Mm-mm.

1337
01:01:00,124 --> 01:01:00,725
-Well, you need to
come tomorrow.

1338
01:01:00,758 --> 01:01:01,291
I mean--

1339
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:01,926
-Probably will.

1340
01:01:01,959 --> 01:01:02,827
-Sunday.

1341
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:03,694
Have you heard about it?

1342
01:01:03,728 --> 01:01:04,729
-I read it in the paper.

1343
01:01:04,762 --> 01:01:05,696
-Did you read it in the paper?

1344
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:06,296
You think you might come?

1345
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:07,131
-Yeah, I might.

1346
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:08,332
-Oh, great.

1347
01:01:08,365 --> 01:01:09,934
Well, this is a little
flyer about it.

1348
01:01:09,967 --> 01:01:10,701
We're going around the
neighborhood, just telling

1349
01:01:10,735 --> 01:01:12,236
folks about it.

1350
01:01:12,269 --> 01:01:13,971
-I was talking to George's
sister Mollie, who teaches in

1351
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,439
our school system, and I said,
you know, with all of this

1352
01:01:15,472 --> 01:01:19,243
hype about "Troll 2," why in the
world don't we try to do

1353
01:01:19,276 --> 01:01:22,112
something here as a fundraiser
for the school?

1354
01:01:22,146 --> 01:01:25,249
And of course, George being the
put the cameras on me sort

1355
01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:27,785
of fella, you know, the
thoughts of that--

1356
01:01:27,818 --> 01:01:31,956
he jumped on that
and ran with it.

1357
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:33,323
-They're going to come.

1358
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:34,925
I know they're going to come.

1359
01:01:34,959 --> 01:01:36,260
These folks will see that,
and there's no question.

1360
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:41,832
How many does that seat
again in there?

1361
01:01:41,866 --> 01:01:42,499
-260.

1362
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:43,400
-260?

1363
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:45,002
Oh, great.

1364
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,136
Did you say you're getting
some people interested?

1365
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:46,937
-Yeah, some.

1366
01:01:46,971 --> 01:01:48,038
I guess you--

1367
01:01:48,072 --> 01:01:48,839
you told some people.

1368
01:01:48,873 --> 01:01:50,307
-Oh, I have, yeah.

1369
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:52,242
We're putting out flyers because
I was in a movie back

1370
01:01:52,276 --> 01:01:54,945
in 1990-- oh, that's
your address.

1371
01:01:54,979 --> 01:01:57,114
It's the worst film ever
made of all time.

1372
01:01:57,147 --> 01:01:59,383
-All right, then.

1373
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:02,186
-But this is a movie that I
was in back in the '90s.

1374
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:02,820
-Yeah, mm-hmm.

1375
01:02:02,853 --> 01:02:03,988
-Yeah.

1376
01:02:04,021 --> 01:02:04,989
-You want me to hang
this up for you?

1377
01:02:05,022 --> 01:02:05,990
-Yeah, would you hang it up?

1378
01:02:06,023 --> 01:02:07,391
-I don't mind.

1379
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:09,193
-Now you had told me that
it had a pretty big cult

1380
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:09,827
following.

1381
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:10,928
-Huge.

1382
01:02:10,961 --> 01:02:11,796
-Out, you know.

1383
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:13,297
-All over the world.

1384
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:15,299
We've got fans in England,
Iceland.

1385
01:02:15,332 --> 01:02:18,769
Honestly, I'm like a cult
luminary when I go to these

1386
01:02:18,803 --> 01:02:19,804
screenings.

1387
01:02:19,837 --> 01:02:20,805
It's just hilarious, Barbara.

1388
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:21,939
I would never have dreamed.

1389
01:02:21,972 --> 01:02:23,173
But it's been a lot--

1390
01:02:23,207 --> 01:02:25,109
-George has told me that
it has spread.

1391
01:02:25,142 --> 01:02:28,112
The interest has spread
or cult, I guess

1392
01:02:28,145 --> 01:02:29,279
you would call it.

1393
01:02:29,313 --> 01:02:30,781
Yeah, I teach Sunday
school class.

1394
01:02:30,815 --> 01:02:32,182
I got about 50 in my Sunday
school class.

1395
01:02:32,216 --> 01:02:35,485
So Sunday morning, I'm
going to issue an

1396
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:37,421
invitation for all of them.

1397
01:02:37,454 --> 01:02:41,491
-Lily, can you put some of
these up at the school?

1398
01:02:41,525 --> 01:02:44,528
-These are?

1399
01:02:44,561 --> 01:02:46,396
-You don't want to?

1400
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:47,965
You see that poster
right there?

1401
01:02:47,998 --> 01:02:48,498
-Uh-huh.

1402
01:02:48,532 --> 01:02:49,099
-"Troll 2."

1403
01:02:49,133 --> 01:02:50,234
-Mm-hmm.

1404
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:50,868
-Do you know anything
about it?

1405
01:02:50,901 --> 01:02:51,401
-Mm-mm.

1406
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:52,169
-You don't?

1407
01:02:52,202 --> 01:02:53,971
Are you serious?

1408
01:02:54,004 --> 01:02:54,972
Oh, my gosh.

1409
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:55,940
-It's a movie or something?

1410
01:02:55,973 --> 01:02:56,340
-Yeah, it's a movie.

1411
01:02:56,373 --> 01:02:57,307
OK.

1412
01:02:57,341 --> 01:02:58,909
Well, I was in that movie.

1413
01:02:58,943 --> 01:03:01,145
-I thought I remembered seeing
that in the paper.

1414
01:03:01,178 --> 01:03:02,312
-Right, right, right, right.

1415
01:03:02,346 --> 01:03:03,147
-Yeah, mm-hmm.

1416
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:03,981
-I must do it.

1417
01:03:04,014 --> 01:03:04,882
I must do it.

1418
01:03:04,915 --> 01:03:05,582
I must do it.

1419
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,316
And he goes, [groans]

1420
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:07,918
like that.

1421
01:03:07,952 --> 01:03:09,286
And he-- and he's going to
pee all over the table.

1422
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:12,022
So then the next scene is
just me going upstairs.

1423
01:03:12,056 --> 01:03:13,557
And I go, you can't piss
on hospitality!

1424
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:16,894
I won't allow it!

1425
01:03:16,927 --> 01:03:19,463
And I was, you know,
doing that too.

1426
01:03:19,496 --> 01:03:20,998
It's a crazy, movie.

1427
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:22,199
-It sounds like it's
a good movie.

1428
01:03:22,232 --> 01:03:24,134
-You need to come
see this thing.

1429
01:03:24,168 --> 01:03:25,235
-I'm going to try, I promise.

1430
01:03:25,269 --> 01:03:26,603
-You got any plans Sunday?

1431
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,105
-No, just going to church.

1432
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:29,373
-Well, good.

1433
01:03:29,406 --> 01:03:30,274
That'd be a great, fun
thing to do after

1434
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:31,942
church, come see this.

1435
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:33,210
But anyway, we'll go over your
treatment plan in just a

1436
01:03:33,243 --> 01:03:33,610
second.

1437
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:34,211
-OK.

1438
01:03:34,244 --> 01:03:35,379
OK.

1439
01:03:35,412 --> 01:03:36,981
-I think George was
born an actor.

1440
01:03:37,014 --> 01:03:41,251
I think dentistry is just
a stage he's on.

1441
01:03:41,285 --> 01:03:43,053
I really do.

1442
01:03:43,087 --> 01:03:46,123
I think he missed his calling
when this was not his lifelong

1443
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:47,557
profession.

1444
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:51,528
I mean, anybody who's known
George early on, teenage

1445
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:53,497
years, college years--

1446
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:56,867
everything he's done has been
something that could have led

1447
01:03:56,901 --> 01:03:58,435
him to this.

1448
01:03:58,468 --> 01:04:00,404
Being a cheerleader at Austin,
he was in front of thousands

1449
01:04:00,437 --> 01:04:01,371
and thousands of people
at a time.

1450
01:04:01,405 --> 01:04:03,240
He was just a natural.

1451
01:04:03,273 --> 01:04:04,574
-George always wanted
to be a movie star.

1452
01:04:04,608 --> 01:04:06,343
I think that was what
was in his heart.

1453
01:04:06,376 --> 01:04:07,912
He was always an entertainer.

1454
01:04:07,945 --> 01:04:10,580
He was, um--

1455
01:04:10,614 --> 01:04:12,082
he was--

1456
01:04:12,116 --> 01:04:13,250
always liked to be in
the limelight and be

1457
01:04:13,283 --> 01:04:14,651
in the middle of--

1458
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,987
the center of attention of
anything that he did.

1459
01:04:17,021 --> 01:04:19,890
-I was in a movie
back in 1989.

1460
01:04:19,924 --> 01:04:23,560
It's called "Troll 2," and it's
become known as the worst

1461
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:25,095
movie of all time.

1462
01:04:25,129 --> 01:04:25,529
-Really?

1463
01:04:25,562 --> 01:04:26,163
-Yeah.

1464
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:27,297
-Hmm.

1465
01:04:27,331 --> 01:04:28,432
-So you're in for
a treat today.

1466
01:04:28,465 --> 01:04:29,967
Ain't she, Rachael?

1467
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,368
-Yeah.

1468
01:04:31,401 --> 01:04:34,138
Can't wait to hear what you
have to say about this.

1469
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:36,373
-What'll happen is you'll
just let your head up.

1470
01:04:36,406 --> 01:04:40,177
And this is just going to go
around your hair in the back.

1471
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,078
-OK.

1472
01:04:41,111 --> 01:04:42,246
-And I just put it on.

1473
01:04:42,279 --> 01:04:43,413
And you should be able
to look out.

1474
01:04:43,447 --> 01:04:44,381
-OK.

1475
01:04:44,414 --> 01:04:47,952
-So it's pretty cool.

1476
01:04:47,985 --> 01:04:51,288
Now, if you want to stop
me and ask me any

1477
01:04:51,321 --> 01:04:52,522
questions, just stop.

1478
01:04:52,556 --> 01:04:54,258
Raise your hand and
stop and ask, OK?

1479
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:56,293
-I would hate to be in his
dental chair right now because

1480
01:04:56,326 --> 01:05:00,297
I know his focus is not on what
he's doing in terms of

1481
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:01,999
dental work.

1482
01:05:02,032 --> 01:05:03,934
It's getting ready for this
weekend and the "Troll 2"

1483
01:05:03,968 --> 01:05:05,369
premier in Alex City.

1484
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,337
-You know that movie, "Troll
2," Dr. Hardy was in?

1485
01:05:07,371 --> 01:05:09,273
MALE SPEAKER (ON PHONE):
I just read about it.

1486
01:05:09,306 --> 01:05:10,640
-Did you read the paper
this morning?

1487
01:05:10,674 --> 01:05:11,675
MALE SPEAKER (ON
PHONE): Mm-hmm.

1488
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:14,178
At 5:00 on Sunday afternoon?

1489
01:05:14,211 --> 01:05:15,379
-Yeah, at Playhouse Cinemas.

1490
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:16,446
Are you going to come?

1491
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,647
MALE SPEAKER (ON
PHONE): Uh-huh.

1492
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:19,549
-Hey, um, we were calling
because--

1493
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:21,585
you know George was in that
movie, "Troll 2?"

1494
01:05:21,618 --> 01:05:22,552
MALE SPEAKER (ON
PHONE): Mm-hmm.

1495
01:05:22,586 --> 01:05:23,553
-Have you heard?

1496
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:24,688
They're having like a--

1497
01:05:24,721 --> 01:05:25,455
FEMALE SPEAKER (OH
PHONE): Hello?

1498
01:05:25,489 --> 01:05:26,590
-Mrs. Roxanna.

1499
01:05:26,623 --> 01:05:27,457
FEMALE SPEAKER (OH
PHONE): Mm-hmm.

1500
01:05:27,491 --> 01:05:29,093
-Hey, this is Micki.

1501
01:05:29,126 --> 01:05:30,227
Dr. Hardy-- you know he was
in the movie "Troll 2?"

1502
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,228
FEMALE SPEAKER (OH
PHONE): [laughs]

1503
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,097
Yeah.

1504
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:35,399
-We're earning our
money today.

1505
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:38,302
-We're showing it this Sunday
in Alex City because we've

1506
01:05:38,335 --> 01:05:40,104
shown it on different
screenings all

1507
01:05:40,137 --> 01:05:41,638
over the United States.

1508
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:44,108
I don't tell too many people
about them-- about it.

1509
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:46,443
Because it's the worst film
ever made of all time.

1510
01:05:46,476 --> 01:05:48,245
So--

1511
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:51,148
anyway, today, we'll get started
with you in just a few

1512
01:05:51,181 --> 01:05:51,548
minutes.

1513
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:52,282
-OK.

1514
01:05:52,316 --> 01:05:52,682
-All right.

1515
01:05:52,716 --> 01:05:54,084
Good.

1516
01:05:57,121 --> 01:05:58,388
Thank you for coming to this.

1517
01:05:58,422 --> 01:05:59,623
-I'm so excited.

1518
01:05:59,656 --> 01:06:01,058
Hi.

1519
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:02,459
-You're all going to
enjoy this thing.

1520
01:06:02,492 --> 01:06:03,460
Thanks for coming.

1521
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:04,494
I know.

1522
01:06:04,528 --> 01:06:05,762
-You're the star of the movie.

1523
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,431
-Thank you.

1524
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:09,466
I was concerned that not very
many people were coming.

1525
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:11,568
I kept trying to tell myself,
don't have any

1526
01:06:11,601 --> 01:06:13,303
expectations around it.

1527
01:06:13,337 --> 01:06:15,639
But then when more and more
people showed up, it made me

1528
01:06:15,672 --> 01:06:18,375
feel a lot better.

1529
01:06:18,408 --> 01:06:19,376
-Get your t-shirts!

1530
01:06:19,409 --> 01:06:20,377
Get your t-shirts!

1531
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:21,778
Get your t-shirts!

1532
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:27,384
Dr. George Hardy right
here on a t-shirt.

1533
01:06:27,417 --> 01:06:30,387
-This crowd was much more
serious watching the film.

1534
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:31,621
We were cracking up.

1535
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:33,090
But then behind us,
I mean, there was

1536
01:06:33,123 --> 01:06:34,291
just like Dr. Vasdela.

1537
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:35,559
She was just like--

1538
01:06:35,592 --> 01:06:37,227
she was really trying to
figure it all out.

1539
01:06:37,261 --> 01:06:38,695
Everybody--

1540
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:40,364
they know what's about to come,
and they all laugh at

1541
01:06:40,397 --> 01:06:41,531
everything beforehand.

1542
01:06:41,565 --> 01:06:42,566
-Right.

1543
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:44,268
-But here, it's just serious.

1544
01:06:44,301 --> 01:06:45,302
It's like everybody--

1545
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:46,503
-Well, the hometown reaction.

1546
01:06:46,536 --> 01:06:48,138
They're just-- they want
to just focus.

1547
01:06:48,172 --> 01:06:49,673
Every--

1548
01:06:49,706 --> 01:06:51,641
every second that you're in the
movie, they're just trying

1549
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:53,043
to take it all in.

1550
01:06:53,077 --> 01:06:54,744
And it's the first time
most of these

1551
01:06:54,778 --> 01:06:56,380
people have seen this.

1552
01:06:56,413 --> 01:06:57,147
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Thank you for coming.

1553
01:06:57,181 --> 01:06:59,749
Thanks a lot.

1554
01:06:59,783 --> 01:07:01,518
-There were a lot of
patients here.

1555
01:07:01,551 --> 01:07:03,120
There were a lot that came.

1556
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:06,356
And I think we'll have
definitely a lot of people

1557
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:09,293
calling us to find out how
he feels, if he's back to

1558
01:07:09,326 --> 01:07:10,494
dentistry or acting.

1559
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:17,301
-So, you know, you're the
Patch Adams of dentistry

1560
01:07:17,334 --> 01:07:17,834
around here.

1561
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:19,136
-Maybe so, yeah.

1562
01:07:19,169 --> 01:07:20,604
-No, you are.

1563
01:07:20,637 --> 01:07:21,738
-But--

1564
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:23,373
-You just make people
feel better.

1565
01:07:23,407 --> 01:07:25,542
-But do you miss that, you know,
the feeling you got,

1566
01:07:25,575 --> 01:07:28,612
going into that audition and
then getting the part, you

1567
01:07:28,645 --> 01:07:31,181
know, that creative outlet?

1568
01:07:31,215 --> 01:07:31,715
-Yeah.

1569
01:07:31,748 --> 01:07:33,417
-OK.

1570
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:35,652
You're established
in your career.

1571
01:07:35,685 --> 01:07:37,087
You've been-- you've
been established.

1572
01:07:37,121 --> 01:07:37,721
-Yeah.

1573
01:07:37,754 --> 01:07:39,256
Yeah, that's fine.

1574
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:40,157
-So but would you ever entertain
the thought of--

1575
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:40,857
-Oh, well, yeah.

1576
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,092
It's a great thing.

1577
01:07:42,126 --> 01:07:44,161
I mean, you know, a lot to me.

1578
01:07:44,194 --> 01:07:45,362
It's great.

1579
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:46,563
This is a very stable
situation for

1580
01:07:46,596 --> 01:07:47,464
me to be doing this.

1581
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:49,133
And it's a nice income.

1582
01:07:49,166 --> 01:07:50,634
MICHAEL (OFFSCREEN): What does
your heart say, George?

1583
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:51,601
-Thank you.

1584
01:07:51,635 --> 01:07:55,272
-Don't tell me the PR end.

1585
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:57,874
-If I-- if I could--
it would be awfully

1586
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,209
hard to leave my dentistry.

1587
01:07:59,243 --> 01:07:59,809
It would really be hard.

1588
01:07:59,843 --> 01:08:01,211
-I know it would.

1589
01:08:01,245 --> 01:08:02,346
And you care about your
staff and your

1590
01:08:02,379 --> 01:08:03,147
patients and your family.

1591
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:04,481
-Well, it-- it--

1592
01:08:04,514 --> 01:08:05,882
it sets up a great
lifestyle for me.

1593
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:08,652
But I really wanted to be
an actor from the start.

1594
01:08:08,685 --> 01:08:10,254
And I just felt like
it would--

1595
01:08:10,287 --> 01:08:12,189
I felt like I would be fun
in front of the camera.

1596
01:08:12,222 --> 01:08:16,293
And I just felt I had
a presence that--

1597
01:08:16,326 --> 01:08:18,595
that I could-- could make
in front of the camera.

1598
01:08:18,628 --> 01:08:20,197
But I just--

1599
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:21,698
I was too scared to do it
because I'm in a small

1600
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:22,866
Southern town.

1601
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:24,834
And my dad kept telling
me, no, son.

1602
01:08:24,868 --> 01:08:26,170
You-- that's too risky.

1603
01:08:26,203 --> 01:08:27,671
You can't do that
kind of thing.

1604
01:08:27,704 --> 01:08:31,475
It was a forced thing for me
to-- to become a dentist.

1605
01:08:31,508 --> 01:08:33,677
And I'd hundreds of thousands
of dollars becoming a

1606
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:35,279
dentist, you know.

1607
01:08:35,312 --> 01:08:38,382
And it wasn't practical to
do something like that.

1608
01:08:38,415 --> 01:08:41,351
I really kind of wanted to have
another shot at acting or

1609
01:08:41,385 --> 01:08:42,519
do another--

1610
01:08:42,552 --> 01:08:43,720
I really think I could
have done--

1611
01:08:43,753 --> 01:08:46,756
done more.

1612
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:50,727
-To be an actor, you've
got to be half crazy.

1613
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:54,798
If you're not willing to head
for New York or LA and try

1614
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:58,768
there, you're never going
to make any money at it.

1615
01:09:04,208 --> 01:09:06,876
But I don't want to live
in LA or New York.

1616
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:09,313
I don't like the big cities.

1617
01:09:09,346 --> 01:09:14,718
I'd like to be able to make a
living doing acting just in a

1618
01:09:14,751 --> 01:09:17,221
smaller town.

1619
01:09:17,254 --> 01:09:19,356
And that's just almost
impossible.

1620
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:27,397
I, uh, started playing old
men right off the bat.

1621
01:09:27,431 --> 01:09:30,634
I played Firs in "Cherry
Orchard." I played Old Ekdal

1622
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:34,338
in "The Wild Duck." I--

1623
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:38,608
I probably have done
several 100 plays.

1624
01:09:38,642 --> 01:09:43,647
This one here is a picture of
the young me when I was a

1625
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,316
freshman in college.

1626
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:49,953
I didn't have a beard then.

1627
01:09:49,986 --> 01:09:54,324
I used to have hair on
top of my head too.

1628
01:09:54,358 --> 01:09:56,593
No children, no--

1629
01:09:56,626 --> 01:09:59,396
no grandchildren, no great
grandchildren or

1630
01:09:59,429 --> 01:10:00,597
anything like that.

1631
01:10:02,832 --> 01:10:06,703
Mostly, I've wasted my life.

1632
01:10:06,736 --> 01:10:08,305
I--

1633
01:10:08,338 --> 01:10:09,639
I always thought I had kind
of potential, but I

1634
01:10:09,673 --> 01:10:11,941
never did use it.

1635
01:10:11,975 --> 01:10:13,743
Don't know.

1636
01:10:13,777 --> 01:10:17,314
More or less, I have frittered
my life what else is there to

1637
01:10:17,347 --> 01:10:18,982
do with a life but
fritter it away?

1638
01:10:23,987 --> 01:10:26,022
-The memorabilia thing
is supposed to be

1639
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,757
a pretty big deal.

1640
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:29,493
The guy from "Heroes" is going
to be there and then John

1641
01:10:29,526 --> 01:10:32,296
Schneider from "The Dukes of
Hazzard." And then a lot of

1642
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:35,465
old "Star Wars" memorabilia
will be out.

1643
01:10:35,499 --> 01:10:38,968
I'm glad Claudio's not with us
this trip, actually, just

1644
01:10:39,002 --> 01:10:46,610
because, uh, um--

1645
01:10:46,643 --> 01:10:48,878
because I really want the
limelight, and Claudio always

1646
01:10:48,912 --> 01:10:50,280
gets the limelight.

1647
01:11:07,431 --> 01:11:10,534
For those of you that have not
seen this movie, they call

1648
01:11:10,567 --> 01:11:13,470
this the Myspace generation's
"Rocky Horror Picture Show."

1649
01:11:13,503 --> 01:11:16,840
So like "Rocky Horror," the
musical, that's just so bad

1650
01:11:16,873 --> 01:11:20,477
it's good, there are lines in
the movie that we had to say,

1651
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:22,312
you just kind of go, where
did that come from?

1652
01:11:22,346 --> 01:11:23,580
Was that really--

1653
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:24,881
what was that all about?

1654
01:11:24,914 --> 01:11:26,683
Did that really happen?

1655
01:11:26,716 --> 01:11:28,352
So, um, that's been one of the
funnest parts about this film

1656
01:11:28,385 --> 01:11:30,487
for everyone.

1657
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:35,792
-Has anyone got any questions,
any more questions?

1658
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:37,461
-It was a disaster.

1659
01:11:37,494 --> 01:11:39,396
I was sure there was going to
be "Troll 2" fans there

1660
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:41,931
everywhere, lined up, you know,
and they're going to be

1661
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:43,867
lined up for sure, you know,
like they are at the

1662
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:45,369
screenings.

1663
01:11:45,402 --> 01:11:46,836
And they're going to all
want our autograph.

1664
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:48,672
Have you ever seen "Troll 2?"
Aw, you're missing it.

1665
01:11:51,575 --> 01:11:54,678
It was the worst film ever made,
worse than any of these

1666
01:11:54,711 --> 01:11:57,914
films ever made here.

1667
01:11:57,947 --> 01:12:01,751
Have you seen "Troll 2?" Do you
like really bad movies?

1668
01:12:01,785 --> 01:12:02,386
Yes?

1669
01:12:02,419 --> 01:12:03,487
-Yeah.

1670
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:03,987
-Well, that's what
this one is.

1671
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:05,622
-Oh, wow.

1672
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:07,457
-It was rated on IMDb as the
worst film that's ever--

1673
01:12:07,491 --> 01:12:08,892
of all time.

1674
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:11,528
"Troll 2." I go, you can't
piss on hospitality!

1675
01:12:11,561 --> 01:12:12,462
I won't allow it!

1676
01:12:12,496 --> 01:12:14,398
I said, you know--

1677
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:16,566
-I'll have to look
out for that.

1678
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,869
-And when I yell at him like
that, then that becomes a

1679
01:12:19,903 --> 01:12:21,671
famous line in the movie.

1680
01:12:21,705 --> 01:12:25,509
We've had about between 15 to
20 screenings in the States,

1681
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:26,476
and they've sold out.

1682
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:26,910
-Yeah?

1683
01:12:26,943 --> 01:12:28,378
-Yeah.

1684
01:12:28,412 --> 01:12:30,614
-You reckon out here,
you did the same?

1685
01:12:30,647 --> 01:12:31,781
-I'm sorry?

1686
01:12:31,815 --> 01:12:34,150
-Would you reckon that
[inaudible]?

1687
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,653
-Come again?

1688
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:37,854
Who wants my autograph?

1689
01:12:40,724 --> 01:12:42,058
Does anybody want
my autograph?

1690
01:12:46,763 --> 01:12:48,698
No one's freaking
going to come.

1691
01:12:48,732 --> 01:12:52,669
We've come 15,000 miles,
and nobody's going to

1692
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:53,770
come to this table.

1693
01:12:53,803 --> 01:12:54,704
You got to laugh.

1694
01:12:54,738 --> 01:12:55,905
Come on.

1695
01:12:58,508 --> 01:13:00,710
You all need to see our
movie that I was in.

1696
01:13:00,744 --> 01:13:02,712
I was in a film.

1697
01:13:02,746 --> 01:13:04,414
I was in a film called
"Troll 2."

1698
01:13:04,448 --> 01:13:05,982
-OK

1699
01:13:06,015 --> 01:13:08,618
-So he's heard of "Troll 2."
He's knows about "Troll 2."

1700
01:13:08,652 --> 01:13:10,954
-Absolutely, no, I love
"Troll 2." I love it.

1701
01:13:10,987 --> 01:13:12,088
Why not?

1702
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:13,923
-This young man's
name is James.

1703
01:13:13,957 --> 01:13:15,425
-James All right.

1704
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:27,971
-What I took away from that is,
I mean, you know, "Troll

1705
01:13:28,004 --> 01:13:31,775
2" only attracts just that
special group of people that,

1706
01:13:31,808 --> 01:13:33,910
you know, know about
the movie.

1707
01:13:33,943 --> 01:13:36,713
Same thing, same thing with
the horror conventions.

1708
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:37,914
It's a different audience.

1709
01:13:54,698 --> 01:13:58,635
Well, this is very
interesting.

1710
01:13:58,668 --> 01:14:01,638
This is very interesting.

1711
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:04,874
I've never seen anything
like this before.

1712
01:14:04,908 --> 01:14:06,810
-Horror fans are unbelievable.

1713
01:14:06,843 --> 01:14:08,512
They're so loyal.

1714
01:14:08,545 --> 01:14:11,781
And they carry the torch for
years and years and years.

1715
01:14:11,815 --> 01:14:13,149
-Yeah, I wonder why
people like that.

1716
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:14,117
I don't--

1717
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:14,851
I don't like horror films.

1718
01:14:14,884 --> 01:14:16,119
-You don't?

1719
01:14:16,152 --> 01:14:17,587
-I mean, it's not that
I don't like them.

1720
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:19,188
I just don't watch too
many horror films.

1721
01:14:19,222 --> 01:14:20,657
But I've started watching them
a little bit more since I was

1722
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:21,525
in this film.

1723
01:14:21,558 --> 01:14:22,191
-Yeah, I love them.

1724
01:14:22,225 --> 01:14:23,026
I love them.

1725
01:14:23,059 --> 01:14:24,227
-It's intriguing.

1726
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:25,495
And so, Erika, you were
in the movie--

1727
01:14:25,529 --> 01:14:26,162
-"Nightmare on

1728
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:28,765
Elm Street 5." -OK.

1729
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:31,835
I've just been talking to all
the, uh, celebrities from

1730
01:14:31,868 --> 01:14:38,241
"Nightmare on the Elm Street"
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

1731
01:14:38,274 --> 01:14:40,009
-Were you in "Troll
1" as well?

1732
01:14:40,043 --> 01:14:42,111
-No, "Troll 1" and "Troll 2"
don't have anything to do with

1733
01:14:42,145 --> 01:14:43,079
each other at all.

1734
01:14:43,112 --> 01:14:44,581
-Oh, that's interesting.

1735
01:14:44,614 --> 01:14:46,215
Have you ever watched
"Troll 2?"

1736
01:14:46,249 --> 01:14:47,083
-Have you seen "Troll 2?"

1737
01:14:47,116 --> 01:14:48,618
-Have you seen it?

1738
01:14:48,652 --> 01:14:49,519
-No.

1739
01:14:49,553 --> 01:14:50,754
-Oh, you are missing it.

1740
01:14:50,787 --> 01:14:52,121
You are totally missing it.

1741
01:14:52,155 --> 01:14:53,222
Have you ever seen "Night--

1742
01:14:53,256 --> 01:14:56,593
Nightmare on Elm Street
3--" Five.

1743
01:14:56,626 --> 01:14:57,527
-Four.

1744
01:14:57,561 --> 01:14:58,828
-Four, four.

1745
01:14:58,862 --> 01:14:59,796
-Four.

1746
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:00,930
I believe I have.

1747
01:15:00,964 --> 01:15:02,999
-Oh, you guys really
are famous.

1748
01:15:03,032 --> 01:15:07,270
It's interesting because a lot
of the actors from the movie

1749
01:15:07,303 --> 01:15:10,974
have never done anything after
"Nightmare on Elm Street,"

1750
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:12,275
just like me.

1751
01:15:12,308 --> 01:15:14,043
You know, they've not
done anything else.

1752
01:15:14,077 --> 01:15:16,746
I was intrigued by a lot of
these people that were signing

1753
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:19,248
autographs from something they'd
done 20 years back.

1754
01:15:19,282 --> 01:15:20,950
Yeah, it's fun to do.

1755
01:15:20,984 --> 01:15:22,619
But it's like--

1756
01:15:22,652 --> 01:15:25,021
it seemed like their whole life
was around what they did

1757
01:15:25,054 --> 01:15:26,723
20, 30 years back.

1758
01:15:26,756 --> 01:15:29,626
And so I thought, god,
don't you have

1759
01:15:29,659 --> 01:15:30,960
something better to do?

1760
01:15:30,994 --> 01:15:31,861
Then I turned around and
thought, don't I have

1761
01:15:31,895 --> 01:15:32,962
something better to do?

1762
01:15:35,965 --> 01:15:38,001
Whew.

1763
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:42,706
I do not see how people
like that stuff.

1764
01:15:42,739 --> 01:15:44,107
God, almighty, no.

1765
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:46,743
This place gives
me the creeps.

1766
01:15:46,776 --> 01:15:48,244
I think I'm about to get sick.

1767
01:15:48,277 --> 01:15:51,180
I mean, why do people
like this shit?

1768
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:52,916
Ugh.

1769
01:15:52,949 --> 01:15:54,784
When you walk around this
place, you kind of get a

1770
01:15:54,818 --> 01:15:56,820
little bit nauseated.

1771
01:15:56,853 --> 01:15:58,354
Like, I've gone to
the bathroom.

1772
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:01,725
Honestly, I've washed my hands
about four or five times.

1773
01:16:01,758 --> 01:16:02,892
God, I feel dirty
or something.

1774
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:07,330
I was--

1775
01:16:07,363 --> 01:16:09,666
I was, uh--

1776
01:16:09,699 --> 01:16:12,135
met a director of--

1777
01:16:12,168 --> 01:16:13,269
big director back there.

1778
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:15,038
It's just amazing.

1779
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:18,141
He's, like, got a huge film
coming out this Friday, like a

1780
01:16:18,174 --> 01:16:19,809
big budget film.

1781
01:16:19,843 --> 01:16:20,644
And it's--

1782
01:16:20,677 --> 01:16:21,778
-Is it "Doomsday?"

1783
01:16:21,811 --> 01:16:22,679
-Yeah, "Doomsday"
is coming out.

1784
01:16:22,712 --> 01:16:23,379
-Yeah, Neil Marshall.

1785
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:24,280
-Yeah, Neil Marshall.

1786
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:25,749
I was talking to him.

1787
01:16:25,782 --> 01:16:28,752
It's just-- it's just
amazing how the--

1788
01:16:28,785 --> 01:16:31,220
you just can't make conversation
with--

1789
01:16:31,254 --> 01:16:32,822
we were just sitting right
there at the table.

1790
01:16:32,856 --> 01:16:36,059
And you can't make conversation
much with people

1791
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:38,194
that are at that
level, I guess.

1792
01:16:38,227 --> 01:16:40,296
I mean, he must have a lot of
things on his mind all the

1793
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:41,898
time, you know.

1794
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:44,067
But then so do I. I've got
teeth to think about.

1795
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:44,834
You know what I mean?

1796
01:16:44,868 --> 01:16:46,402
-Yeah, totally.

1797
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:49,205
-I mean, that's more important
than some computer graphics

1798
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:53,076
guy morphing a movie,
don't you think?

1799
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:57,647
For $30,000 million?

1800
01:16:57,681 --> 01:16:59,215
And there's plenty of gingivitis
around here too.

1801
01:16:59,248 --> 01:17:00,116
Have you noticed that?

1802
01:17:00,149 --> 01:17:01,985
Tons of gingivitis.

1803
01:17:02,018 --> 01:17:03,286
DARREN (OFFSCREEN): Is there?

1804
01:17:03,319 --> 01:17:04,253
I never notice that.

1805
01:17:04,287 --> 01:17:06,022
-It's really bad.

1806
01:17:06,055 --> 01:17:09,192
I guarantee you only about 5%
of these people floss their

1807
01:17:09,225 --> 01:17:10,694
teeth on a daily basis.

1808
01:17:14,931 --> 01:17:15,832
Oh, my god.

1809
01:17:15,865 --> 01:17:16,800
This--

1810
01:17:16,833 --> 01:17:18,802
these folks are weird.

1811
01:17:18,835 --> 01:17:21,304
I mean, this is not Halloween.

1812
01:17:21,337 --> 01:17:22,305
What's they day today?

1813
01:17:22,338 --> 01:17:23,306
March 9th?

1814
01:17:23,339 --> 01:17:24,774
-March, yeah.

1815
01:17:24,808 --> 01:17:25,675
-Freaking weird.

1816
01:17:25,709 --> 01:17:27,143
These folks are just--

1817
01:17:27,176 --> 01:17:30,079
they've lost it.

1818
01:17:30,113 --> 01:17:31,948
I'm just sick of this place.

1819
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:32,916
Let's get out of here.

1820
01:17:32,949 --> 01:17:34,818
Let's flip this joint.

1821
01:17:34,851 --> 01:17:35,852
You want to?

1822
01:17:35,885 --> 01:17:36,920
-Yeah, let's get out of here.

1823
01:17:36,953 --> 01:17:37,821
-Let's get out of here.

1824
01:17:37,854 --> 01:17:38,454
Let's just clean it up.

1825
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:39,455
I am sick of this.

1826
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,090
I will never do this again.

1827
01:17:41,124 --> 01:17:43,893
I think I was pretty much burned
out on "Troll 2" stuff.

1828
01:17:43,927 --> 01:17:46,195
It was fun and something
I did, you know.

1829
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:48,264
But I wouldn't want
to do this again.

1830
01:17:48,297 --> 01:17:52,168
You know, it gets old after
saying the piss on hospitality

1831
01:17:52,201 --> 01:17:54,838
scene over and over again.

1832
01:17:54,871 --> 01:17:57,440
I can't imagine what it must
be like for Celine Dion to

1833
01:17:57,473 --> 01:18:00,043
sing, uh, the "Titanic" song.

1834
01:18:00,076 --> 01:18:00,476
You know?

1835
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:01,978
I mean--

1836
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:03,246
I mean, she's probably
sung it 5,000 times.

1837
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:04,413
And to sing it again?

1838
01:18:04,447 --> 01:18:07,016
You know, how do you
keep doing that?

1839
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:08,217
Poor Celine.

1840
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:20,797
TIM (OFFSCREEN): We started
the Rolling Roadshow about

1841
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:22,766
seven years ago.

1842
01:18:22,799 --> 01:18:26,435
It came about as an offshoot
of what we do at the Alamo

1843
01:18:26,469 --> 01:18:28,171
Drafthouse.

1844
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:30,506
We've always done a lot of
themed events at the theater.

1845
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:34,844
And we thought, well, one of the
best ways that we can have

1846
01:18:34,878 --> 01:18:38,414
the ultimate movie experience
is to have super fans in a

1847
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:40,884
place that's almost like a
trip to Mecca for them.

1848
01:18:40,917 --> 01:18:44,153
So we started doing nationwide
tours and doing famous in

1849
01:18:44,187 --> 01:18:45,922
famous locations.

1850
01:18:45,955 --> 01:18:48,992
And when we got involved with
"Troll 2," I don't know when

1851
01:18:49,025 --> 01:18:51,327
the idea came about or how
the idea came about.

1852
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:53,997
But it just seemed like, yeah,
that's really something that's

1853
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:55,799
got to be done.

1854
01:18:55,832 --> 01:18:58,067
-I guess famous movies and
famous locations doesn't

1855
01:18:58,101 --> 01:19:01,037
really apply to this screening
either way.

1856
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,338
TIM (OFFSCREEN): No, it's a not
so famous movie in a not

1857
01:19:02,371 --> 01:19:04,073
so famous location.

1858
01:19:04,107 --> 01:19:06,475
But it's famous in the minds of
the people that are going

1859
01:19:06,509 --> 01:19:07,877
to come here.

1860
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:23,159
-The whole time, I just kept,
in my head, just thinking, I

1861
01:19:23,192 --> 01:19:27,263
feel like that if I came and
witnessed first hand, it would

1862
01:19:27,296 --> 01:19:28,798
dawn on me, oh.

1863
01:19:28,832 --> 01:19:30,133
It's just like--

1864
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:32,035
it's so intriguing to people.

1865
01:19:32,068 --> 01:19:33,436
But I couldn't figure it out.

1866
01:19:33,469 --> 01:19:35,071
I still can't figure it out.

1867
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:39,008
With everyone I signed, I wanted
to go, are you sure?

1868
01:19:39,042 --> 01:19:40,009
-Oh, god.

1869
01:19:40,043 --> 01:19:41,010
That's great.

1870
01:19:41,044 --> 01:19:43,980
Oh, god.

1871
01:19:44,013 --> 01:19:47,951
-I don't know if I have a better
memory of fandom than

1872
01:19:47,984 --> 01:19:48,852
this event.

1873
01:19:48,885 --> 01:19:51,320
This was pretty strong.

1874
01:19:51,354 --> 01:19:54,323
-Where is Margo Prey?

1875
01:19:54,357 --> 01:19:55,291
We love her.

1876
01:19:55,324 --> 01:19:56,926
We miss her.

1877
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:00,063
-A lot of the cast members
will be here tomorrow.

1878
01:20:00,096 --> 01:20:04,467
I think just about everybody,
except for Margo.

1879
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,970
Yeah.

1880
01:20:07,003 --> 01:20:08,504
MICHAEL (OFFSCREEN):
Is it impossible?

1881
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:10,439
Is it impossible to get you to
this screening, completely

1882
01:20:10,473 --> 01:20:11,074
impossible?

1883
01:20:11,107 --> 01:20:11,507
-It is.

1884
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:12,208
It is.

1885
01:20:12,241 --> 01:20:13,109
-Oh, man.

1886
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:13,542
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): Wow.

1887
01:20:13,576 --> 01:20:15,311
-It is.

1888
01:20:15,344 --> 01:20:16,512
-I think you're the only cast
member that won't be there.

1889
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:18,081
-Who's not going to be there?

1890
01:20:18,114 --> 01:20:19,215
-I know you want to come.

1891
01:20:19,248 --> 01:20:19,983
-I do.

1892
01:20:20,016 --> 01:20:20,549
-I can feel it.

1893
01:20:20,583 --> 01:20:21,450
I can feel it.

1894
01:20:21,484 --> 01:20:22,618
-I just know that I--

1895
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:24,087
I just know that it's
complicated.

1896
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,621
It's just complicated.

1897
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:27,256
And I'd be afraid, and
I'd be nervous.

1898
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:28,958
And I wouldn't know
what to do.

1899
01:20:28,992 --> 01:20:31,160
-I mean, if you could have
anything to remedy this whole

1900
01:20:31,194 --> 01:20:32,561
solution, what would it be?

1901
01:20:32,595 --> 01:20:35,131
-To go away somewhere where
no one can find me.

1902
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:37,100
-Really?

1903
01:20:37,133 --> 01:20:42,105
That's the-- that's the
solution to it all?

1904
01:20:42,138 --> 01:20:46,175
-And up somewhere, anywhere, I
don't care where, in another

1905
01:20:46,209 --> 01:20:48,611
house, in another place, in
a normal neighborhood with

1906
01:20:48,644 --> 01:20:50,013
normal people.

1907
01:20:52,248 --> 01:20:54,183
So they make noise
all night long.

1908
01:20:54,217 --> 01:20:56,119
And the noise is so intense
that sometimes

1909
01:20:56,152 --> 01:20:57,386
it makes you dizzy.

1910
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:58,421
-What is the sound like?

1911
01:20:58,454 --> 01:20:59,388
What kind of noise is it?

1912
01:20:59,422 --> 01:21:01,190
-[high pitched scream]

1913
01:21:04,393 --> 01:21:06,362
-That is--

1914
01:21:06,395 --> 01:21:08,898
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): Wow.

1915
01:21:08,932 --> 01:21:11,300
MICHAEL (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

1916
01:21:11,334 --> 01:21:12,168
-Okey-doke.

1917
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:13,036
-Take care.

1918
01:21:13,069 --> 01:21:13,569
You're a sweetheart.

1919
01:21:13,602 --> 01:21:14,203
-Thank you.

1920
01:21:14,237 --> 01:21:14,904
-Bye-bye

1921
01:21:14,938 --> 01:21:15,338
-Bye-bye.

1922
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:16,039
-Bye.

1923
01:21:16,072 --> 01:21:17,506
-Bye-bye.

1924
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:19,342
-But I was hoping, starting over
there with you guys, we

1925
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:21,210
could just go through, and
if you gave us one or two

1926
01:21:21,244 --> 01:21:24,313
adjectives that describe the
way you felt when you first

1927
01:21:24,347 --> 01:21:28,017
saw "Troll 2" after
being in it.

1928
01:21:28,051 --> 01:21:33,990
-Um, well, I saw it actually,
right when it was first

1929
01:21:34,023 --> 01:21:35,591
released on HBO.

1930
01:21:35,624 --> 01:21:37,360
And I think I tuned
in maybe halfway

1931
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:39,195
through that first time.

1932
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:42,598
Um, I was confused.

1933
01:21:42,631 --> 01:21:44,067
And then I was depressed.

1934
01:21:48,504 --> 01:21:49,973
-The actors--

1935
01:21:50,006 --> 01:21:51,707
every time, the same.

1936
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:55,578
-We thought we were all making
a bona fide horror film.

1937
01:21:55,611 --> 01:22:00,416
And unfortunately, when none
of us got scripts, full

1938
01:22:00,449 --> 01:22:02,085
scripts-- so we didn't
really know--

1939
01:22:02,118 --> 01:22:03,686
-You are wrong!

1940
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:06,589
You are completely wrong.

1941
01:22:06,622 --> 01:22:10,126
-Or at least, nobody in our
group got full scripts.

1942
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:13,963
So we didn't know exactly what
the flow of the story was

1943
01:22:13,997 --> 01:22:15,464
going to be or what our parts
were going to be.

1944
01:22:38,387 --> 01:22:42,591
-Actually, in the script, I was
turned into a plant and

1945
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:44,327
put into a plot.

1946
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:47,063
And Darren and I were right next
to each other, and we had

1947
01:22:47,096 --> 01:22:49,665
dialog all the way
through the end.

1948
01:22:49,698 --> 01:22:50,566
-You don't remember.

1949
01:22:50,599 --> 01:22:52,235
-But they cut it out.

1950
01:22:52,268 --> 01:22:53,702
And then when I was done
filming, I was like, what the

1951
01:22:53,736 --> 01:22:56,205
hell happened to, like, the end,
my scenes and all that?

1952
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:57,406
And so I didn't know
what happened to me

1953
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:58,441
till I watched it.

1954
01:22:58,474 --> 01:22:59,642
And I really still don't know.

1955
01:22:59,675 --> 01:23:00,776
-Well, you don't remember
anything.

1956
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:01,677
-Yes, we do.

1957
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:02,345
The whole time, we do.

1958
01:23:02,378 --> 01:23:03,246
-No.

1959
01:23:03,279 --> 01:23:04,213
-OK.

1960
01:23:04,247 --> 01:23:06,149
-OK, now it's my time to--

1961
01:23:06,182 --> 01:23:07,350
to say to you.

1962
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:20,063
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): So
are there any outtakes from

1963
01:23:20,096 --> 01:23:30,139
"Troll 2?"

1964
01:23:30,139 --> 01:23:40,149
"Troll 2?"

1965
01:24:06,842 --> 01:24:10,079
JESSE (OFFSCREEN): Claudio's
made so many movies.

1966
01:24:10,113 --> 01:24:13,249
I want to know what he thinks
about his career because, you

1967
01:24:13,282 --> 01:24:15,684
know, John Ford was pumping
out like three

1968
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:17,286
films a year for years.

1969
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:19,688
And he never gave a shit
about his movies.

1970
01:24:19,722 --> 01:24:21,157
He just was a filmmaker.

1971
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:22,491
That's just what he did.

1972
01:24:22,525 --> 01:24:26,262
-I never see the movie
with the print, the

1973
01:24:26,295 --> 01:24:28,264
real print, you know?

1974
01:24:28,297 --> 01:24:30,666
That's wonderful for me.

1975
01:24:30,699 --> 01:24:37,606
I want to understand what kind
of movie I did 18 years ago.

1976
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,575
Now maybe I can understand.

1977
01:25:34,563 --> 01:25:36,899
-I hope that he understands,
you know, how

1978
01:25:36,932 --> 01:25:38,501
wonderful "Troll 2" was.

1979
01:25:38,534 --> 01:25:40,503
I don't even want to
call it a bad film.

1980
01:25:40,536 --> 01:25:42,405
Like, it's an amazing film.

1981
01:25:42,438 --> 01:25:44,873
-It's not a matter of the
production value or

1982
01:25:44,907 --> 01:25:47,943
the budget or talent.

1983
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:50,879
It's just whether or not
something entertains.

1984
01:25:50,913 --> 01:25:54,450
-A film like this maybe happens
once a generation.

1985
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:56,885
-It's a real magic formula.

1986
01:25:56,919 --> 01:25:58,554
The stars aligned.

1987
01:25:58,587 --> 01:26:00,889
-How do you make a movie
like "Troll 2" then?

1988
01:26:00,923 --> 01:26:03,859
-You can't set out to make
a film like this.

1989
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:08,797
The gods of filmmaking were
looking down on you.

1990
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:10,633
-This is our 20th-something--

1991
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:12,301
20-something-th screening.

1992
01:26:12,335 --> 01:26:13,736
I--

1993
01:26:13,769 --> 01:26:16,872
I was tired of seeing "Troll
2" for the 20th time.

1994
01:26:16,905 --> 01:26:18,274
Three.

1995
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:23,346
Maybe a little few
egg whites too.

1996
01:26:23,379 --> 01:26:25,814
That would be good.

1997
01:26:25,848 --> 01:26:27,216
Egg whites are terrific.

1998
01:26:29,518 --> 01:26:31,954
Half a banana so that
the glycemic

1999
01:26:31,987 --> 01:26:33,356
index is nice and high.

2000
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:48,404
Today, I have a great life
here in Alabama, a really

2001
01:26:48,437 --> 01:26:48,837
great life.

2002
01:26:48,871 --> 01:26:50,005
Yeah.

2003
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:50,973
It's just home.

2004
01:26:51,006 --> 01:26:53,609
Alabama's just home.

2005
01:26:53,642 --> 01:26:54,943
I love Lake Martin.

2006
01:26:54,977 --> 01:26:57,313
I mean, it's the jewel
of the Southeast.

2007
01:26:57,346 --> 01:26:59,482
And I have a good dental
practice, a

2008
01:26:59,515 --> 01:27:02,885
strong, solid practice.

2009
01:27:02,918 --> 01:27:05,321
I've got great relationships
with my patients.

2010
01:27:07,923 --> 01:27:10,659
And I have four beautiful
women that work with me.

2011
01:27:13,529 --> 01:27:18,734
I have a great relationship with
my family, my mom and dad

2012
01:27:18,767 --> 01:27:20,736
are still living, which
is really--

2013
01:27:20,769 --> 01:27:23,339
I'm very, very thankful
for that.

2014
01:27:23,372 --> 01:27:26,342
I love my daughters, and I have
a good relationship with

2015
01:27:26,375 --> 01:27:27,510
my ex-wife.

2016
01:27:27,543 --> 01:27:30,313
And I have a lot of
good friends.

2017
01:27:30,346 --> 01:27:31,747
I guess at this point,
I kind of like

2018
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:33,316
keeping my life simple.

2019
01:27:33,349 --> 01:27:34,517
And the simpler, the better.

-Yes.

2025
01:28:08,551 --> 01:28:13,889
I would star in "Troll 3." I'd
love to star in "Troll 3."

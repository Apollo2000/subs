2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,260
Hello.

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,340
In the traditional motion picture story,

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,340
the villains are usually defeated,

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,420
the ending is a happy one.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,780
I can make no such promise
for the picture you're about to watch.

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,060
The story isn't over.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,128
You, in the audience,
are part of the conflict.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,860
What has happened so far

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,884
and what is happening now
is far from encouraging.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,450
How we meet the Communist challenge
depends on you.

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,140
We are united in detesting
Communist slavery.

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,322
The Soviets are the best team
in the world.

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,900
Hockey proved that the Soviet system
was the best system.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,004
When the Big Red Machine gets rolling,
they're mighty hard to stop.

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,300
Their target is us.

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,220
Our institutions,
our families, our children.

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,260
The Soviets beginning
to create their attack...

19
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,600
Brilliant play!

20
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,380
Although they don't show emotion,

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,801
let's face it,
they are a microcosm of their society.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,340
You talk about a dynasty!

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,260
This is a bona fide superstar.

24
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,540
Maybe best in the world.

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,180
Slava Fetisov, one of the greatest
defensemen in the history...

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,362
Fetisov, centered in front. They score!

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,100
They were the totalitarian team.

28
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,487
The KGB guys were always there.

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,525
And it is sheer folly for us not to make
every conceivable preparation to win.

30
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,401
Okay, I'd just like,
kind of, a few things about...

31
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,820
Because, basically,
what I'm trying to get in the film is

32
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,660
what it was like to live
in the Soviet Union.

33
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,966
And...

34
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,780
Yeah, and describe your feeling about...

35
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,565
I'm busy now. Hold on.
I've got some business.

36
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,286
Okay.

37
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,140
My point is that American audiences

38
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,460
don't really understand the things
that people didn't have

39
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,340
or even the good things.

40
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,580
But what are some things that you can say...
"We had to wait in line, or we had to..."

41
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,162
That's a cliché, but,
"We had to do this, we had to do that."

42
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,540
Travel, you know.

43
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,089
Just basic things
that we take for granted these days.

44
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,763
Like, this is... "Look, we couldn't travel.
We couldn't..." You know, whatever.

45
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,820
I was born in the Soviet Union in '58.

46
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,540
It was 13 years
after World War ll was over.

47
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,900
The whole country was ruined.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,340
We lost 20 million people.

49
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,965
It's a lot.

50
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,646
We was living in Stalin's buildings.

51
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,140
Probably a 400 square foot apartment.

52
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,020
No running water,
no toilets, three families.

53
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,203
It was a pretty rough lifestyle.

54
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,241
I was a happy kid.

55
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,004
I play a game. I play hockey.

56
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,846
Pucks was empty cans
and stuff like that.

57
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,849
But, we had fun.

58
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,540
Our heroes played for the
Red Army Club, for the national team.

59
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,180
Hockey was the most popular sport
in the Soviet Union

60
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,900
because the Soviet hockey team

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,500
represented the peak of what
the Soviet Union had achieved.

62
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,127
And was proof that the Soviet
system was the best system.

63
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,769
It was politics, really.

64
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,580
My mom and dad,
they probably collected for two years.

65
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,860
They bought for me gloves,
helmet, and the skates.

66
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,940
On the black market,
it probably cost 250 rubles.

67
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,249
It was big money for a Soviet family.

68
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,420
There was a huge line of the boys.

69
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,460
With the sticks. With the skates.

70
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,780
With the parents. With the grandparents.

71
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,442
It's unbelievable.
It's probably 3-4 miles long.

72
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,091
When it was decided
that hockey would be the thing,

73
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,849
money, everything went into that.

74
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,020
They had a very well-organized system.

75
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,860
I mean, from childhood to...

76
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,601
They really picked out the best
of the best of the best.

77
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,924
And this was a nationwide system.

78
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,660
I was 9 years old.

79
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,860
I stayed in line probably 7 or 8 hours.

80
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,008
I was exhausted.

81
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,340
I got no chance.

82
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,660
They said, "Thank you very much.
Come again next year."

83
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,207
So I practiced 3 or 4 times a day.

84
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,540
Finally, they said I was good
enough to make the team.

85
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,804
I was so proud to play for Red Army.

86
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,860
Skate with no fear.

87
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,420
We'll give you exercises
no one has ever seen.

88
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,921
You'll be juggling your sticks,

89
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,206
twisting them around your head.

90
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,841
Where's the smile?
You're playing hockey!

91
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,163
Jump! Quick!

92
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,220
Tarasov was the father
of the Soviet system.

93
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,260
Great!

94
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,860
And the head coach of the Red Army.

95
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,620
You'll become great hockey players!

96
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,460
And great men!

97
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,780
This man played a big role in my life.

98
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,580
I was Red Army in my heart.

99
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,126
I came there. I was 10 years old.

100
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,300
Tarasov, he developed the program.

101
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,140
He wrote a few books about hockey.

102
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,928
These books laid next to my
bed since I was a little kid.

103
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,570
He described the game
in a very simple way.

104
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,660
Hockey is an aggressive game.

105
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,460
It's not like tennis, right?

106
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,300
So I wouldn't say that the North...

107
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,140
The Americans, the Canadians
are more aggressive than the Russians.

108
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,660
I wouldn't say that.

109
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,740
But I do think that there was
a different concept

110
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,080
of how you play the game.

111
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,740
Tarasov, who was an extremely
creative man,

112
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,980
he saw hockey
as this amazingly intricate game

113
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,220
of passing the puck.

114
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,500
The Soviets play more of
a finessed, improvisational game...

115
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,888
And they could cut
and weave beautifully.

116
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,660
Their passing game was
an intricate, artistic tapestry,

117
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,047
which we didn't see over here.

118
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,250
We emphasized everything
in a unit, of a collective.

119
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,326
The puck carrier was the servant
of the other players.

120
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,660
Our training camps were together.

121
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,890
My chess team
and the national hockey team.

122
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,700
They would often come to me

123
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,691
if they had questions
on psychological training.

124
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,460
He had theories of the way the game
should be played like a chess game.

125
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,780
He studied the training of the Bolshoi,

126
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,900
and he applied it to hockey.

127
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,580
Look at these dances, eh?

128
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,728
It's like the boogie woogie!

129
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,700
Sport is an art form.

130
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,609
That's what Tarasov thought.

131
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,740
Creativity, a vivid mind, and constant

132
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,323
thinking are needed for greatness.

133
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,481
My father was not just a hockey coach.

134
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,900
He was a great mentor.

135
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,483
He could see the potential
in a young person.

136
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,446
He developed my patriotism.

137
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,500
For us, it's very important.

138
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,660
For me since I was ten, it was
very important what was in front.

139
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,411
The name of my team, my country.

140
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,220
I belong to the great nation.

141
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,740
If you wear the national team uniform,

142
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,260
that's your duty. To do your best.

143
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,250
To represent your country.

144
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,809
For the Soviets, sports were,
in a way, a kind of warfare.

145
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,500
The game, for them, wasn't just a game.

146
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,605
It was also part of what you
would call propaganda, actually.

147
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,820
Making it very clear
that we're the best,

148
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,660
and we're the best
because of the Soviet system,

149
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,205
because of socialism.

150
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,209
That's why we're the best.

151
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,568
At the moment, you are ahead of us.

152
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,200
We still have a lot of work to do
to catch up with you.

153
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,726
We'll do that.

154
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,486
We'll catch up.

155
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,420
We'll surpass you.

156
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,980
You may perhaps laugh now,
but when we overtake you,

157
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,324
we'll wave our hand as we say, "Capitalists!
Goodbye! Catch up if you can!"

158
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,209
Have you ever watched hockey?

159
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,810
I like playing with dolls.

160
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,340
Do you know what these letters mean:

161
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,220
K-G-B?

162
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,060
No.

163
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,300
Yeah, you were born much later.

164
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,607
You didn't have to deal
with this organization.

165
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,220
The Central Red Army prepare to travel

166
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,660
to North America to play
a series of games

167
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,001
against the best teams of the West.

168
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,660
One outstanding player we didn't
see in last year's junior series

169
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,889
was the brilliant defenseman
Viacheslav Fetisov.

170
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,580
When we crossed the Atlantic
to play against

171
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,730
the best Ontario clubs at 16 years old,
I was happy.

172
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,300
There was one flight per week.

173
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,100
Empty because nobody was flying.

174
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,420
Of course, regular people cannot leave

175
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,940
the country because that's the system.

176
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,780
I used to go with them
to provide security,

177
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:21,171
and to prevent any "escapes"
to the West.

178
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,260
The "special people"
who traveled with us,

179
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,900
they give your passport before you
get to passport control,

180
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,040
and they collect the passport
when you cross the border.

181
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,020
The Canadians put us
in a five-star hotel.

182
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,804
Chandeliers. Marble.

183
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,020
One room per player,

184
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,406
and a hundred TV channels.

185
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,485
Hey, right now, Loblaws is
having a huge frozen food sale.

186
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,100
Fruits, vegetables in the wintertime.

187
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,980
I've never seen it before for us.

188
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,420
In the Soviet Union,
we got fish only one day a week.

189
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,140
It was "Fish Thursday."

190
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,420
When people went abroad,
especially for the first time,

191
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,764
they were so surprised
by the differences.

192
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,460
We got $48.

193
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,140
They gave us pocket money.

194
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,500
I bought 2 jeans, 3 pair of shorts.

195
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,207
Lots of stuff which just didn't
exist in Moscow.

196
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,820
However, they never saw

197
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,847
the negative side
of the other countries.

198
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,180
Control was intense.

199
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,649
Without such intense control,
there was no point in the work at all.

200
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,340
I was never even thinking
about to defect.

201
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,220
Never. What's that mean?

202
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,685
It meant you were happy.

203
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,643
I'm happy.

204
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,420
Tonight, Team Canada
hosts the Soviet Union.

205
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,488
It's a team we've never seen.

206
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,608
The building was 12,000 people. Packed.

207
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,300
I was so nervous, y'know?

208
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,020
We got shitty gear.

209
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,580
- Canada versus the Soviet Union.
- Team Canada has a definite edge.

210
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,580
The two things
that Team Canada do the best,

211
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,220
they shoot better and they skate better.

212
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,420
Canadians, fans and sportswriters
seem to agree

213
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,682
their team will clobber
the Russian pretenders.

214
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,650
We beat them in all 5 games.

215
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,407
Fetisov over the line.
Fetisov trying to get it out in front.

216
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,460
Throws it out in front.
They shoot, they score!

217
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,780
Fetisov back out of the slot.
Fetisov feeds.

218
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,980
Fetisov with a brilliant play.
He scores!

219
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,100
He scores!

220
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,620
- Fetisov.
- Fetisov.

221
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,900
And the game is over.

222
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,810
The Soviet Union has beaten Team Canada.

223
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,940
Viacheslav Fetisov.
His teammates call him Slava.

224
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,020
He's undoubtedly
one of the great young stars

225
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,700
of the Central Red Army team.

226
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,980
It's been said of him
that he can skate backwards

227
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,890
as fast as most defensemen
can skate forwards.

228
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,620
Kids growing up
now want to play like Fetisov.

229
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,460
Which players do you like the best?

230
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,800
- Fetisov.
- Fetisov.

231
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,769
Okay, Gabe. Let's go. Let's go. Work!

232
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,980
You guys are used to doing
nothing over there in America.

233
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,764
Yeah. Okay.

234
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,921
I want to ask you about Viktor Tikhonov.

235
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,900
How did he become
the national team coach,

236
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,082
and what was your relationship to him?

237
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,980
Tarasov got in trouble because

238
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,860
Tarasov's team scored a goal,
but it wasn't counted.

239
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,420
And he became so angry,

240
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,249
he actually took his players
off the ice.

241
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,180
Tarasov disagreed and stopped the game.

242
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,700
We didn't play for 40 minutes.

243
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,609
And there sat Brezhnev.

244
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,211
And Brezhnev was saying,
"What the hell is this?"

245
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,481
They removed him from the national team.

246
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,962
They punished him for this.

247
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,130
The KGB Chief was a fan
of the Red Army Club.

248
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,208
Tikhonov was his protégé.

249
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,700
You mean, Tikhonov was so powerful
in the Communist Party that they made him...

250
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,040
What do you mean powerful?

251
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,140
I mean, can't someone just say...

252
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,020
What do you mean powerful?
He's a part of the system.

253
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,860
The Chief of the KGB put him
in the position.

254
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,249
Viktor Tikhonov was disliked or detested
by most of the players.

255
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,004
If we didn't obey,
he would punish us severely.

256
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,968
He would take your salary
or bar you from playing.

257
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,580
Some rather vigorous discussion.

258
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,923
Our friend, Mr. Tikhonov, is ticked off,
if you'll forgive the expression.

259
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,260
Tikhonov's been heavily criticized
by some of the players.

260
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,540
One of them said if he ever
needs a heart transplant,

261
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,927
he wants Viktor's
because Viktor's never used his.

262
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,780
You can see him
yelling at them on the bench,

263
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,568
and, actually, he would hit them in practice,
and smash them in the head.

264
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,766
Hammer them like this.

265
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,460
I'm very volatile.

266
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,660
That's how I am.

267
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,860
And the guys know that.

268
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,780
They know when to approach me.

269
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,780
He's looking a little bit
deranged right there.

270
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,460
Tikhonov was in a very advanced
position from the beginning.

271
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,140
He got the best team in the world.

272
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,140
He got all kinds of support
from the government.

273
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,460
In the Soviet Union,
you can get any player.

274
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,282
You draft him into the army
and he becomes a Red Army player.

275
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,100
Can Tikhonov be successful without us?

276
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,500
I don't know.

277
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,820
We being successful without him?

278
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,660
I think so.

279
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,049
Here, suddenly, there was a team
that actually could beat Team Canada.

280
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,763
And the hockey players
were all considered as heroes.

281
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,486
And hockey itself became
tremendously popular in the country.

282
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,890
Can you tell me
about your first Olympics?

283
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,007
Want a story? You got the time?

284
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,020
I come to you this evening to
discuss the extremely important

285
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,408
and rapidly changing
circumstances in Southwest Asia.

286
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,260
Massive Soviet military forces
have invaded

287
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,060
the small, nonaligned
sovereign nation of Afghanistan.

288
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,380
A Soviet-occupied Afghanistan
is a stepping stone

289
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,644
to possible control over much
of the world's oil supplies.

290
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,260
It is a deliberate effort of
a powerful, atheistic government

291
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,260
to subjugate an independent
Islamic people.

292
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,900
Heavy fighting continues in Afghanistan.

293
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,580
With invading Soviet troops
in parts of the country,

294
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,651
world indignation at the apparent
Soviet takeover is coming to a head.

295
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,420
Cold War passions
were running very, very hot.

296
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,420
And then, the United States
happened to be hosting

297
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,761
the Olympic Games at Lake Placid.

298
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,721
They had this Cold War
political flavor to it.

299
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,420
The David versus Goliath
matchup featuring

300
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,580
a US team comprised of
inexperienced college players

301
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,940
going up against a veteran Soviet team

302
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,060
widely regarded
as the best hockey team in the world.

303
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,100
The United States
had lost an exhibition game

304
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,727
to the Soviets, 10-3,
a couple weeks before the Olympics.

305
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,760
That showed the difference in skill level
between the two teams.

306
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,980
The excitement, the tension building.

307
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,700
The Olympic Center filling to capacity.

308
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,220
In a political or nationalistic sense,
I'm sure this game is being viewed

309
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,260
with varying perspectives,
but it is a hockey game.

310
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,180
The United States and the Soviet Union
on a sheet of ice

311
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,220
in Lake Placid, New York.

312
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,980
Here we go, as the game is underway.

313
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,860
The Soviet Union in red
and the United States in white.

314
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,169
It's been 20 years since an American team
has beat the Soviets.

315
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,660
Pavelich up ahead to Schneider.
Slap shot! Goes in!

316
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,886
A winner!

317
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,340
The United States has tied the game!

318
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,740
A couple of months ago, would you have
believed this would be possible?

319
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,820
Very careless rebound.

320
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,526
An uncharacteristically
careless rebound by Tretiak.

321
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,380
Here's Tretiak on the bench.

322
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,767
A very uncharacteristic place for him.

323
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,020
He leaves it for Zhluktov.

324
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,340
Zhluktov, number 22,
who passes it to Makarov.

325
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,851
Craig makes the save.

326
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,009
He shoots, and he scores!

327
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,688
4-3, the United States on top.

328
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,700
Checked by Ramsey.

329
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,860
McClanahan is there.
The puck is still loose.

330
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,008
Eleven seconds. You got 10 seconds.

331
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,700
The countdown going on right now.

332
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,380
Morrow up to Silk.

333
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,220
Five seconds left in the game!

334
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,940
Do you believe in miracles? Yes!

335
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,540
Unbelievable!

336
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,420
USA! USA! USA!

337
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,683
USA! USA!

338
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,401
We're number one. We rule. US rules!

339
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,500
Destiny.

340
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,740
And tell the whole team
that we are extremely proud of them.

341
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,900
They've come through
like true champions.

342
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,580
It was a great win, you know,
for everybody,

343
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,780
and I think it just proves
that our way of life

344
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,848
is the proper way to continue on.

345
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,565
It was tough.

346
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,020
You better believe
the Soviet authorities are not happy.

347
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,580
The government will certainly
be taking matters into their own hands.

348
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,740
...if they don't see an opportunity...

349
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,940
What's the price they pay over there?

350
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,010
Finally, tonight, from overseas,
a story about hockey.

351
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,020
A team in the Soviet Union
is still dwelling on

352
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,043
a championship lost.

353
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,362
There have been some changes made.

354
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,300
After the Olympic games,

355
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,041
Tikhonov fired the veterans.

356
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,046
It's wrong.

357
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,380
All these guys,
all these supporting staff,

358
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,300
this is the successful team.

359
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,925
Not him.

360
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,300
After that game,
the workload became tremendous.

361
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,482
There were players who pissed blood.

362
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,900
We practiced four times a day
in the summertime.

363
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,331
Four times.

364
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,660
We're working at a heart rate of 220.

365
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,489
Can you imagine? 220.

366
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,340
Players had to live
in these hockey camps,

367
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,011
isolated 11 months of the year.

368
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,481
And they would get out
maybe one weekend every month.

369
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,340
You win by being merciless in training.

370
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:42,402
The coach must perpetuate
this tradition.

371
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,540
A coach must find a player's pressure

372
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,440
points to achieve maximum results.

373
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,540
It's the carrot and the stick,
like an animal trainer.

374
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,180
To get masterpieces from the beasts,

375
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,284
you have to force them a little bit.

376
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,540
Did I respect him?

377
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,020
As my coach? Yes.

378
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,885
As a person? No.

379
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,380
The Soviets are back
after that American defeat,

380
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,020
back in 1980 at Lake Placid.

381
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,500
Well, there aren't many left
from that 1980 team.

382
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,841
Fetisov, a couple
of their superstars remain,

383
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,566
but the rest of the team
has been completely rebuilt.

384
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,740
You have to be born a goalie.

385
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,410
I am a destroyer.

386
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,690
I destroy the plans of the adversary.

387
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,980
Vladislav Tretiak in the net.

388
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,420
The best goalie in the world.

389
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,660
Tretiak is almost unbeatable.

390
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,580
The greatest goaltender
the game has ever seen.

391
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,971
Tikhonov was given
ready-to-use material.

392
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,242
Tarasov had created stars.

393
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,126
It was to his credit that
he created a five-man unit.

394
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,083
They were the best.

395
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,524
...are the strike force
of the Soviet team.

396
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,100
When the five got together,
no one knew how to play them.

397
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,568
At left wing, number 24, Sergei Makarov.

398
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,482
He was the most dangerous player
in the world.

399
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,100
The mastery and the wizardry of Makarov,

400
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,010
who hung onto that puck
and then just gave it.

401
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,500
He can make the goal
from nowhere, anytime.

402
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,420
He scored more goals than
anybody in our hockey history.

403
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,284
And they score!

404
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,126
At right wing, number nine,
Vladimir Krutov.

405
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,847
He was a Russian tank.

406
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,700
Krutov here, only 5'9

407
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,371
but he weighs almost 200 pounds.

408
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,170
He was the soul of the five-man unit.

409
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,860
At center, number 11, Igor Larionov.

410
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,020
Igor was the professor.

411
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,566
I've got a question.
Why was he "the professor"?

412
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,620
Because he was skinny like that.

413
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,291
Not a professor, maybe nerd.

414
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,850
Skinny but tough.

415
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,050
It kind of misleads lots of guys.

416
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,684
Number seven, Alexei Kasatonov.

417
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,020
He was my best friend.

418
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,100
Seven and two, Fetisov and Kasatonov.

419
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,020
They've played together for so long

420
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,220
that they know each other's
moves instinctively.

421
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,180
And when one goes in,
the other kind of trails back,

422
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,700
and it just works for them.

423
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,740
Fetisov to Kasatonov.

424
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,569
Shoots, he scores!

425
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,766
He was teammate. He was roommate.

426
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,562
Alex became my younger brother.

427
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,780
My mom cooked for him,

428
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,851
and my grandpa was like his grandpa.

429
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:37,000
It's tough to find any closer relationship
between two men.

430
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,740
Alex is probably the best all-around
defensemen ever to play the game.

431
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,562
I believe he (Slava) was the best defenseman
in the history of world hockey.

432
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,889
Number two, Viacheslav Fetisov.

433
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,883
Slava was our leader, of course.

434
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,529
In the way he skated, his character.

435
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,460
And he gets leveled by Fetisov.

436
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,460
Fetisov showing that good strength.

437
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,564
6'1 205 pounds. He's no small player.

438
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,140
Tikhonov came from the Politburo
and said:

439
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,980
"Slava, I got good news.

440
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,740
"You're going to be captain of
the Soviet National Team."

441
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,922
I said, "Thank you, but I'm not."

442
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,929
He said, "You stupid?"

443
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,321
I said, "I'm not."

444
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,060
But when I talked to the guys,

445
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,481
they said, "We want you
to be our captain."

446
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,645
I said, "Okay."

447
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,820
Why they choose me, I don't know.

448
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,049
But I become the youngest ever
captain of the national team.

449
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,620
In Soviet hockey,
the lines stay together.

450
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,006
Five-man unit.

451
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,820
They like to keep the line
and the two defensemen together

452
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,809
for as long as they possibly can.

453
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:05,402
We were great friends in real life.

454
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,731
I tell you, they were good people,
kind and always ready to help.

455
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,180
We never let each other down.

456
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,725
What were they like as individuals?

457
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,641
We were all practically
the same, you know?

458
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,860
We'd celebrate the birthdays,
the family things.

459
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,100
We went to restaurants together.
We would spend vacation time.

460
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,380
We were all the same.

461
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,460
But did they read, have hobbies?

462
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,891
What were their personalities?

463
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,209
We were the same.

464
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,481
Why are you asking me the same thing?

465
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,642
They just clicked from the get-go.

466
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,481
They had a lot of confidence in each other,
and they had a lot of pride.

467
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,731
And those players will go down in history
as the greatest five-man units of all time.

468
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,100
They had a sixth sense about them.

469
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,362
They had eyes in the back of their head.

470
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,660
Sometimes you feel without a look.

471
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,000
Your partner must be there.

472
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,580
The Soviets really perfected the weave.

473
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,140
They move like one body.

474
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,368
Holy cow, what a play by the Soviets!

475
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,340
Fetisov was number two in scoring,

476
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,580
even though he was a defender.

477
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,620
He would go forward
and Makarov would draw back.

478
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,006
They score!

479
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,780
Everything was like this.

480
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,140
The opponents did not know who to cover.

481
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,900
Circling back, Fetisov,
Larionov, Makarov.

482
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,001
He scores!

483
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,540
The goals that they scored
would be highlight reel goals.

484
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,483
They all touched the puck.

485
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,100
The skill level of that team
was astounding.

486
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,363
They elevated hockey to an art form.

487
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,940
No one could hold them back.

488
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,441
What they did on the ice...

489
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,483
Yes, they were the best.

490
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,140
The Soviet Union
has defeated Team Canada

491
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,460
8-1 in the Canada Cup.

492
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,180
And this crowd here at the Forum
has gone very quiet

493
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,408
as Scotty Bowman looks on.

494
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,860
We had Wayne Gretzky,
Guy Lafleur, Gilbert Perreault.

495
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,380
But they whipped us so bad.

496
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,845
We didn't expect it.

497
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,980
They have beaten the Islanders,
the Boston Bruins,

498
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,620
and now the Jersey Devils.

499
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,660
A Soviet team has defeated

500
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,060
the defending Stanley Cup champion.
The first time ever.

501
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,607
They've outscored the opposition 42-5.

502
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,980
The Soviets are the best team
in the world.

503
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,020
Gold medal, give it to the Russians.
Let them go home.

504
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,300
- You just don't see how it can get any better.
- He scores!

505
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,060
Well, you know,
the Russians are so darn good.

506
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,420
One man and a goalie to beat.

507
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,648
Drops it back. Krutov scores.

508
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,764
That's how it's done.

509
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,327
You'll not see any nicer
than that, folks.

510
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,020
You just can't compete.

511
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,380
It's just too difficult.

512
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,290
When the Big Red Machine gets rolling,
they're mighty hard to stop.

513
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,540
This is the big one.

514
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,900
So, we are now
into the gold medal match.

515
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,368
It's Czechoslovakia
against the Soviet Union.

516
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,780
For the Soviets, it's very,
very important

517
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,540
because they didn't take that medal
in Lake Placid in 1980.

518
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,540
And if the Czechs take it
from them this time,

519
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,644
there will really be
a shake-up in Soviet hockey.

520
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,050
This is Larionov, number 11.

521
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,500
Drops it back. Getting set.

522
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,700
Here's Kasatonov.

523
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,260
Back to Larionov.

524
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,820
Larionov is checked.

525
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,420
Krutov has it in behind the net.

526
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,620
Makarov is standing
right in front of the goal.

527
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,860
Here's Krutov.

528
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,962
He gets it back, now to Fetisov.

529
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,460
Fetisov setting up. Slides it in front.

530
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,005
Krutov scores!

531
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,328
Krutov! And it's 2-0 for the Soviets!

532
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,740
It was the greatest moment in my life.

533
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,260
My childhood dream come true.

534
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,850
I got this gold medal.

535
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,761
I was the happiest man in the world.

536
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:28,041
My brother, his name was Anatoly.

537
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:36,367
I think he would be one of the
best forwards ever to play the game.

538
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,660
He was like a son to me.

539
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,560
We got almost 10 years apart.

540
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,126
He was killed in a car accident in 1985.

541
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,330
I was driving the car.

542
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,460
To be in a situation like that,

543
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,820
I didn't want to live.

544
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,960
I share everything they go through.

545
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,420
All the training,
all happiness and sadness.

546
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,380
Losses and victories, all the positive,

547
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,121
and the negative, too.

548
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,860
Andrei Khomutov found out
his father was going to die soon.

549
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,660
He came to him and said,

550
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,889
"Viktor, can you let me go
to see my father?"

551
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,020
He said, "No.

552
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,566
"You have to get ready
for the next game."

553
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,620
Andrei never saw his father again.

554
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,980
This was tough to imagine for me,

555
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,128
that Tikhonov can do
something like that.

556
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,220
The players often ask,
"What is this all for?

557
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,860
"Why get maximum scores?

558
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,611
"Maybe we should rest a little."

559
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,768
It's absurd.

560
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,740
They was eleven months at camp.

561
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,900
Training camp.

562
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,020
And thirty-six nights, they was home.

563
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,567
They never get out of that camp.

564
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,700
We always fight against Tikhonov
to let us live at home.

565
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,500
But he said,
"This is the style of my team.

566
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:48,562
"And this is the style of Soviet sport
in the Soviet Union."

567
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,260
I'm by myself in the apartment.

568
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,260
And when he talks on the phone with me,

569
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,340
it's like lines staying behind him,

570
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,860
and everybody listening.

571
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,649
Because it's one phone
and it's like twenty-five guys.

572
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,660
We get together, the Russian 5,

573
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,580
and said, "Can we lose
the World Championships next?

574
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,580
"Maybe they'll kick his ass
out of the team.

575
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,180
"And we can live a better life."

576
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,420
I'm telling you,
so many times we asked ourselves,

577
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,900
"Why are you suffering so much?

578
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,962
"Why play for a guy who doesn't
respect us as a human being?"

579
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,060
In the Soviet period,

580
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,300
the individual had to obey very strictly

581
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,140
and had no say.

582
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,926
And if he tried to have a say,
that could end his career.

583
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,848
So many competitions
and you are never home.

584
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,980
At first, I'd get home
and Dima wouldn't recognize me.

585
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,660
I'd ask him, "Where's your dad?"

586
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,001
And he would show me photographs.

587
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,161
Your youth is wasted.

588
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,330
New Year's Eve, holidays, birthdays...

589
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,888
You're always alone with the team,

590
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,980
without your wife and kids.
It's a tough life.

591
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:26,803
At 32, I felt old and worn out.

592
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,220
I wanted freedom to train
on my own, or to stop playing.

593
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:36,123
So I was forced to quit.

594
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,500
There was a lot of disillusionment

595
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,524
that was going on in the Soviet Union.

596
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,460
For over 70 years,

597
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,900
the Soviet Union was a closed society

598
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,685
and the Iron Curtain was a reality.

599
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,121
The belief that existed for so long

600
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,020
that had really held
the country together,

601
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:26,842
the profound, idealistic belief
that was part of it, dissipated.

602
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,620
Dear comrades, delegates,

603
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,485
a new democratic era is upon us.

604
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,004
Do you think people realized
that this was the end of the Cold War?

605
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,180
What's the Cold War?

606
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,260
The Cold War.

607
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,620
No, I know. What's the Cold War?

608
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,846
What's it about?

609
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,780
About the money?

610
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,100
About business?

611
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,740
Sure, probably. You think so?

612
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,780
For resources?

613
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,042
I think so.

614
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,140
Nothing else?

615
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,620
I think it's just about fear.

616
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,768
Fear of what?

617
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,762
National security, probably, right?

618
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,540
That's bullshit.

619
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,980
The sports world has heard
the Russians are coming.

620
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,140
That is, that some
of those world-class athletes

621
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,860
that are in the Soviet Union
will be allowed to come west,

622
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,883
turn pro and play for big rubles.

623
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,686
Soviet athletes are in big demand.

624
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,445
New Jersey Devils have offered
defenseman Viacheslav Fetisov

625
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,060
a half million dollars
for just one year along the blue line.

626
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,980
We think that they will raise
the level of excellence

627
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,003
in the entire National Hockey League.

628
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,700
The only reason these well-dressed
and well-off hockey bosses

629
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,820
even consider selling players

630
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,180
is that they have been told
by the Politburo

631
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,220
their big subsidies must be cut.

632
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,450
The sale of defenseman Fetisov
to New Jersey is one way out.

633
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,180
It is not something
those officials want to do,

634
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,340
but in this clash of capitalism
and socialism,

635
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,522
money is proving to be the big lure.

636
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,900
And if you're a Soviet player,
and you see what's ahead for yourself,

637
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,526
except more of this dreariness.

638
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,180
And then they realized, "My God.

639
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,220
"Look what these teams and the players have
in the NHL and the money they get,

640
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,210
"and the automobiles
and the houses and the vacations."

641
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,724
Then you're gonna want like hell
to get out of there.

642
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,700
Tikhonov came from the Politburo
to the training camp and said,

643
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:47,540
"Slava, if you do good in Calgary,
in the Olympics, you win the gold medal,

644
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:52,020
"you're gonna be the first Soviet player
who go play in National Hockey League."

645
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,451
I said, "Okay."

646
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,009
The face of the Soviet Union,
Slava Fetisov.

647
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,660
There's the captain of the Soviet Union,

648
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,980
Viacheslav Fetisov,

649
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,560
representing his team
on the podium here.

650
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,330
I was so happy.

651
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,740
When I landed in Moscow,
they called me to the Ministry.

652
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,540
They give me in the Kremlin,
the Lenin Award.

653
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,246
The biggest award in the country.

654
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,220
And then I was called for private talk
between three men:

655
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,527
The Minister of Sport,
Tikhonov and myself.

656
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,900
When the Minister said,
"Slava, finally you deserve it.

657
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,420
"We'll let you go. Good luck
and I wish you all the best."

658
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:41,780
And he said, "Am I right, Viktor?"

659
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,620
You know what Viktor said?

660
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,820
"Yeah, you're right. But I need
him for another year.

661
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:54,609
"Because we can't replace him."

662
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:02,362
He said, "January 2nd, we got the
Super Series against New Jersey.

663
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,140
"And we promise you after
the game against New Jersey,

664
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:11,643
"you're going to finish
the season in the NHL."

665
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,380
Fetisov goes back to get it.

666
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,140
Top scoring defenseman.

667
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,060
Four times Player of the Year.

668
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,401
Fetisov right there, he scores!

669
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,927
It's a four-to-nothing Red Army lead.

670
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,049
Is Slava Fetisov coming to the NHL?

671
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,682
It's possible for him to stay here.

672
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,801
Now?

673
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,042
Not now, eventually.

674
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,940
See what happened?
Publicly he said, "He can go."

675
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:51,047
But inside, not behind my back,
in front of me he said, "No."

676
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,380
What's the current status of this thing?

677
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,500
We keep hearing yes, and then we hear no,
and then we hear maybe.

678
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,340
Well, really, the status right now,

679
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,408
it relies in the hands
of the Soviet government.

680
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,380
Slava Fetisov wants to be here,

681
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,180
and he wants to play
in the National Hockey League.

682
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,020
But really, we have no control
over what is happening right now.

683
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,122
Neither has Fetisov.

684
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,286
Lou Lamoriello
showed me around New York.

685
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,420
He said, "Slava, I learned today
they'll never let you go."

686
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,340
He said, "This is the life.

687
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,329
"You should stay here."

688
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,683
So when Lou asked you to defect,
did you consider it?

689
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,847
No.

690
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,540
I cannot run away from my country.

691
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,483
I cannot

692
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,923
do something illegal.

693
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,220
When I get back,
I called a press conference.

694
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,820
And I said, "I'm never going to play
for the Tikhonov team anymore.

695
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,524
"Because they cheated me."

696
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:17,420
The day his article went out,

697
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,286
our phone stopped ringing.

698
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,420
People who we know stopped
talking to us.

699
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,603
The sports facilities in the country,

700
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,929
nobody let me in.

701
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,500
You come there, the people know you,
they admire you.

702
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,180
They put their head down and said,

703
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,620
"No, Slava.
You cannot come and skate here.

704
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,940
"No, if we let you skate,
they are going to kill me."

705
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,260
Agents were placed
in their social circle

706
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:55,780
so we could know
the situation from within.

707
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:02,923
These people were just
pawns on a chess board.

708
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,900
When you sit at home and you know

709
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,483
some car is sitting down
near your entrance,

710
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,700
and they're going to follow you,

711
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,203
and they're going to try to listen. If you
meet someone, what do you talk about?

712
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,802
What's the worst they could do?

713
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,235
Anything.

714
00:47:27,336 --> 00:47:31,660
Anything. If they try to put Slava
in prison, what do you think?

715
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,525
Did they do anything?

716
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,286
In Kiev.

717
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:39,180
In Kiev.

718
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,920
What happened?

719
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,604
What happened...

720
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:50,884
They tried to put Slava in a car
and take him to the police station.

721
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,700
They put the cuffs on him,
and cuffed him to the battery.

722
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,540
And they just beat him up
until four o'clock in the morning.

723
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,611
When they called Tikhonov,
and Tikhonov came and picked him up.

724
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,780
That's when we heard
when Tikhonov was screaming,

725
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,900
"Do anything, just put him in prison.

726
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,291
"Just don't let him out of the country."

727
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:14,485
If Slava will not be included on the team,
what will be your next move?

728
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,060
Most likely, we'll all refuse to participate
in the world championship.

729
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,740
You are three. Who else will join you?

730
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:24,460
There are others who will support us.

731
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,380
Krutov stood up for me,

732
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,780
with my teammates Makarov and Larionov.

733
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,884
Krutov has always been quiet.

734
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,780
When you see the situation get crucial,

735
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,370
he steps up.

736
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,620
And from him, when he said something,

737
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:50,011
it sounds different when you're not
talking all the time. It's very powerful.

738
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,251
Do you mind, kind of,
just telling the story?

739
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,660
It's very important
because it's a very personal...

740
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,140
It was that.

741
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,260
Slava was leaving.

742
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:06,251
I stayed to play.

743
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,340
It was a big surprise for me that

744
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,684
Alex Kasatonov didn't go
with the boys on TV.

745
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,420
You know, my best friend

746
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,841
said, "No, I'm not going."

747
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,443
So it was a big surprise.

748
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,260
It's a very long story.

749
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,283
Yeah, but you know...

750
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:38,851
It's the story of our country, I think.

751
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:45,567
He said publicly I wasn't
right to leave the team.

752
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:52,020
He took the position of
Coach Tikhonov in this situation.

753
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,202
That's the funniest part.

754
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,283
You were best friends. I mean,
I want to know, kind of... You know...

755
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,882
It's not the time.

756
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,330
Sorry.

757
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,290
To be continued.

758
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,488
Next question.

759
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:38,169
A special department was
created in the KGB.

760
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,291
Do you want to say anything?

761
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,740
Take your glasses off.

762
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,380
You can't even see me in dark glasses.

763
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,580
Come on, they are transparent.

764
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,140
I can see you well.

765
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,380
Look at the sun.

766
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,020
I just did. I looked.

767
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,380
I have sunglasses, too.

768
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,260
They are white.

769
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,203
Like this color white.

770
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,450
Continue.

771
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,891
Continue.

772
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,724
When did things start to go wrong?

773
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,620
Maybe it was

774
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,961
the incident with Mogilny.

775
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,180
Number 14 is Alexander Mogilny.

776
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,580
Many NHL scouts say

777
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,540
he is the best 19-year-old hockey player
in the world.

778
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,486
I asked Mogilny if he would consider
playing in the National Hockey League.

779
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,100
I'd like, but I suppose
that it's more interesting

780
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,820
to play in the Soviet Union.

781
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,660
All right, what if we offer you
a million dollars cash?

782
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,649
Then would you come and play in the NHL?

783
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:54,020
The Soviet team was over there
playing a tournament,

784
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,380
and they wake up one morning,
and Mogilny was gone.

785
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,500
His defection began with a phone call

786
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,340
to the managers
of the NHL's Buffalo Sabres.

787
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,940
Were you in Sweden to bring him out?

788
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,900
No. What do you mean, was I
in Sweden to bring him out?

789
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,968
I was in Sweden to meet him,
at his request.

790
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,620
Mogilny was considered a traitor,

791
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,961
especially because he was
in the Soviet Army.

792
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,561
He escaped, as they say.

793
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,020
But it was kind of...

794
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:32,205
How do you say... Illegal.

795
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,500
Here, people enjoy life.

796
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,180
Everyone has their own home,
their own cars.

797
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,820
But that's not the point.

798
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,900
Here, people live for themselves.

799
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,844
And there, I lived like a homeless dog.

800
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,360
Why did the government care so much
if the hockey players defected?

801
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,721
Well...

802
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,607
It's difficult to speak
about hockey separately.

803
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,060
It wouldn't be like,

804
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,900
"Oh my God! Hockey players are leaving!"

805
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,843
The regime wouldn't put it like that.

806
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:15,180
One defection could lead to a wave.

807
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:21,242
This was a big threat to Soviet power.

808
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:27,091
Politically, every time
something like that happened,

809
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,740
it was used in the media,

810
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,660
so it was a victory for the West

811
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,140
and a loss for the Soviet Union.

812
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,300
Authorities in Soviet sports
and hockey authorities,

813
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,300
they realized that it's much better
for themselves, for the system,

814
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,420
to allow the players to go to the NHL

815
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,220
without the opportunity to escape,

816
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,210
just because it's damaged
the image of the country.

817
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,220
Then they start to negotiate.

818
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:01,820
They said, "Okay, it looks like the
high authority agreed to let you go.

819
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,420
"But you have to understand.
You'll make $1000 a month.

820
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,620
"Doesn't matter how much
is your contract.

821
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,220
"You're gonna bring money
back to the embassy."

822
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,971
I said, "No way. I'm not going.

823
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,180
"I mean, are you crazy?"

824
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,260
They said, "You crazy."

825
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,380
I said, "Okay."

826
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,380
They called me in a couple days
and said, "Slava,

827
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,646
"you got special permission
from the Politburo.

828
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,620
"Because you were so good for
hockey, for the national team,

829
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,566
"and you were captain,
we'll give you 10% of your salary.

830
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:42,051
"This is a special offer
made especially for you.

831
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,660
"Nobody has to know about the 10%."

832
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,728
I said, "No."

833
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,820
Then it was 20%.

834
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:54,660
Then it was 25%.

835
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:58,287
They called my mom. They called my wife.
They tried to scare them.

836
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:04,660
Momma said, "Son, the people called me.
They explained you got no chance.

837
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,780
"They'll not let you go.
They'll make something bad for you.

838
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,803
"You should not fight anymore."

839
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:15,804
And Igor Larionov signed
a deal and left.

840
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,780
The Russians are here.

841
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,900
Igor Larionov, center,

842
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,420
Vancouver, a playmaker.

843
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,700
The NHL is paying
the Soviet Union to allow Igor

844
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,326
and other Soviet veterans to play here.

845
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,500
Soviet players in the NHL

846
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,860
have to turn a large chunk
of their contract

847
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,540
over to their cash-starved country.

848
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,325
But to the Larionovs, it's worth it.

849
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,420
In Moscow, things were
completely different.

850
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,330
If they lost, he would not
be allowed to come home.

851
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,380
He was happy with a 50/50
split with the system.

852
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,420
Who, Igor?

853
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,700
Igor, and Sergei and Vladimir.

854
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,122
They was happy to split 50/50.

855
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,087
I said, "No."

856
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,683
And I was alone.

857
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:17,100
They said, "What do you want?"

858
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,260
I said, "I want my contract."

859
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,460
The problem is
that this defenseman's life

860
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,980
is controlled
by the Soviet Defense Ministry.

861
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:28,324
Fetisov is an officer in the army
and plays for its top team.

862
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,460
The team is cleared.
Tikhonov has cleared it.

863
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,609
And all they're waiting for
is the Minister of Defense.

864
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,940
Yazov. Dmitry Yazov.

865
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,740
The Minister of Defense.

866
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,650
The second most powerful man
in the country.

867
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,620
They called me
to the Ministry of Defense.

868
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,140
Tried to straighten me out.

869
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,420
They put my uniform on me.

870
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,490
It was a huge, huge office.

871
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:59,140
He said, "America? This is my enemy.

872
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,620
"No way you're going to America."

873
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,020
He said, "You don't wanna play?

874
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:08,365
"You're not gonna play
anymore, anywhere, anyhow."

875
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,100
Something clicked inside of me.
I have to do something.

876
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:18,420
I have to provoke some result
out of this visit.

877
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,180
Because I knew I'd never get back here.

878
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,408
Never.

879
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,567
Ever.

880
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,060
I said, "Mr. Minister,

881
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:32,780
"if you don't do what you promised to me,
you're not a Minister. You're not an officer.

882
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,008
"Release me from the army.

883
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,660
"Thank you very much."

884
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,286
I turn and go.

885
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,010
He was screaming, yelling.

886
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:45,020
"You ....sucker.
You try to play for our enemies?

887
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,203
"You know what I can do with you? I'll send
you to Siberia. You'll never get out."

888
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,260
But I never turned back.

889
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,441
I left.

890
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,340
You know what?

891
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,568
In ten days, they give me a passport.

892
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,340
And I was free of the Army.

893
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:05,128
The first multiple working entrance
visa to United States.

894
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,563
Wait a second. Go back.

895
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,962
I don't get why Yazov let you leave
if he was mad at you.

896
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,540
I'm not a historian.

897
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,860
My feeling was the country
tried to change

898
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:30,100
something because it's Perestroika time.

899
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,260
But he doesn't want changes.

900
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:37,540
Everybody was afraid.
It's understandable.

901
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,180
It's like in a dark room,

902
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,220
try to find a dark cat.

903
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,688
You know, it's not funny.

904
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,290
Okay.

905
00:59:54,360 --> 01:00:00,083
You'll go play our nation's hockey.

906
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,680
Skillful and effective hockey.

907
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,163
You'll be great.

908
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,651
Coach's Corner with Don Cherry.

909
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,660
You look happy. What's the matter?

910
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,500
You know, I was gonna come on here
and be a good guy, you know, right?

911
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,940
The first show, don't talk about the Russians,
and you know, and all that stuff.

912
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:39,300
And be all, you know, I go,
"We'll let them come over here." No way!

913
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,820
I don't want them here!

914
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,540
The players don't want them here.

915
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,620
And you're gonna be sorry
they're over here.

916
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,740
Nobody like me in the United States.

917
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:49,780
Nobody knew what I went through.

918
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,580
They would think in clichés.

919
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,660
I'm a bad guy, a communist.

920
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,140
They talk about the Soviets
coming over and play here.

921
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,940
Would some of the players be
a little upset about that?

922
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,740
It would be a touchy situation,
you know,

923
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:04,980
because you don't like to see
players on your team lose jobs,

924
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:08,004
and if they come, there's gonna
be two less spots in the lineup.

925
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,860
A shot taken by Clark on Fetisov,

926
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,220
who's not retaliating.

927
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,980
Fetisov looks like,
"You can't be doing this."

928
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:20,084
Kind of disbelief when Clark
started swinging at him.

929
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,603
Let's take a look at it again.

930
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,340
When I walk in the wives' lounge,
it was like

931
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,820
I was staying in one corner,

932
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,620
and the rest were staying
in the other corner.

933
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:36,100
And was looking at me,
and talking in their own language.

934
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,860
I understand nothing
they're talking about.

935
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:39,900
Looking at me again.

936
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,340
Laughing and looking and talking.

937
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,100
And I think,
"What are they talking about?"

938
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,201
I have no idea.

939
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,980
The coach hate Russians.
See it when he look at you, he hate you.

940
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,700
How you gonna play for the guy
who hate you

941
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,740
because you're a Soviet?

942
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:57,700
Hockey over here
was a more brutal form of the game

943
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,040
with elbows...

944
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:06,409
Sticks high, and individualistic play.

945
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,003
There was no style.

946
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,369
They're so simple.

947
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,060
They're not creative.

948
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,700
It was the worst team in the league.

949
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,500
Somebody gets open
and they skate away from you.

950
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,540
And you end up on your ass.

951
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,530
They look at you like
you never played before.

952
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,140
Life challenged me all the time.

953
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:32,449
All of a sudden, he was drafted
by the New Jersey Devils.

954
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,340
...there, Kasatonov.

955
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:37,940
Kasatonov, he's a little overshadowed,
I think, by Fetisov.

956
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,281
He's a great hockey player.

957
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,041
Did you tell the coaches, like,
"Listen, I can't play with this guy.

958
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,367
"I mean, I just can't."

959
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,460
Nobody gave a shit
about our relationship.

960
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,164
They sign him. We have to play.

961
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:57,260
It wasn't friendship anymore.
It wasn't team spirit.

962
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,380
It was kind of competition.

963
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:02,086
It was tough, trust me.

964
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,060
Fetisov and Kasatonov,

965
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,369
best friends off the ice,
defensive partners on the ice.

966
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,740
I came to the United States
to play the hockey game.

967
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,968
Not to be involved in this bullshit.

968
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,700
Welcome to the big leagues, Vladimir.

969
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,940
Krutov hit hard! Down he goes.

970
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,860
The Soviets in the big league
have been having trouble.

971
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,700
They're too old or too slow.

972
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:29,300
They're too confused out there,
and they tend to get too fancy.

973
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,420
They tend to pass
when they should shoot,

974
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,887
and it gets the natives restless.

975
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,211
They're not here for the Bolshoi Ballet.

976
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,860
It's a completely new experience for me

977
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,962
to play on a losing team.

978
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,969
I ask the fans to be patient.

979
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,402
It didn't work out for me,
staying in the NHL.

980
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,740
But that's okay, I think.

981
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:06,802
All in all, my life worked out.
I think everything's okay.

982
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,220
When you come from a system

983
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,540
where everything is regimented
every day of your life,

984
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,700
and it was for these hockey players,

985
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,380
and then you're...

986
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,340
You go to a completely
different environment

987
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:25,420
where you're supposed
to be able to organize

988
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:29,241
and run your own life,
you become sort of lost.

989
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,849
I was 36.

990
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:42,460
And they trade me from
New Jersey to Detroit.

991
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:45,020
Do you miss Larionov, Krutov, Makarov?

992
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,380
Of course.

993
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,211
We spent so many years
playing and living together.

994
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:55,123
You miss the ones you're close to.

995
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:58,540
I think, "Oh my God.
I did something wrong.

996
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,300
"You've been successful.
You've always been on top.

997
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,641
"Now you're a loser?"

998
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,481
Do you feel that the game
is more fun here?

999
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,380
I get out of the dressing room
and see my wife by herself.

1000
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,580
Crying.

1001
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,380
I said, "Why are you crying?"

1002
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:24,420
She said, "Oh, we got probably
our last chance."

1003
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,900
I said, "No."

1004
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,580
We've got two choices:

1005
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,700
To pack the stuff, go back

1006
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,450
or to fight through.

1007
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:52,640
Soviet Army tanks in their hundreds
moved onto the streets of Moscow,

1008
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:55,923
but the takeover has not gone
ahead without resistance.

1009
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,780
...was something that
certainly wasn't anticipated

1010
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,370
in this form, this quickly.

1011
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:08,460
The extent of the changes
and the immediacy of them

1012
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,403
certainly were not anticipated.

1013
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:24,444
I hereby resign my post
as President of the USSR.

1014
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,724
An end has been put to the
Cold War and the arms race,

1015
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:34,650
and the mad militarization
of this country.

1016
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:37,809
The threat of nuclear war is over.

1017
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:55,801
I wish everyone all the best.

1018
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:04,020
I knew how good they were.
I mean, I had watched them play.

1019
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,180
Bobby, the Soviets,
they never stop skating.

1020
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:07,850
There is constant motion.

1021
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:11,540
Their style of hockey
bothered our goalies and our defensemen,

1022
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:14,500
because, you know, you get in tune
to playing a certain way,

1023
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:17,604
and then all of a sudden,
the opposition does something different.

1024
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,966
The Canadians are getting caught up
in the Soviet vortex.

1025
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:27,500
We initially had three
that came out about the same time,

1026
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,620
Konstantinov, Fedorov and Kozlov.

1027
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:32,140
We were able to make a trade
and get Igor Larionov.

1028
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,500
And once we got the fourth member
of the Russians,

1029
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,820
we said, "Let's go and get one more."

1030
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,260
We needed a defenseman,
and we got Slava Fetisov.

1031
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,488
He was about 37 or 38.

1032
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,842
You could say we took a chance with him.

1033
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,340
When they got together

1034
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:53,820
and they designed
their own type of plays,

1035
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,048
we were surprised ourselves.

1036
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,527
And the Soviet symphony is tuning up.

1037
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,860
They crisscrossed a lot.

1038
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,980
And they made a lot of passes
in their own zone.

1039
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,940
If they don't see
an opportunity to score,

1040
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:20,681
they turn back with the puck
and develop another attack.

1041
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:23,841
They played a totally different style.

1042
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,420
Together again on the same team.

1043
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,091
It was like a fish put back
in the water.

1044
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,691
You never know what they'll do next.

1045
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:45,523
You become younger right away,
and enjoy the game.

1046
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:54,121
Around the arena, Russian often seems
like a second language.

1047
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:01,724
A lot of people complain about it.

1048
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,620
To me, see, I don't...
They're playing for us, and they're good.

1049
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,768
No, sir! And he gets leveled by Fetisov.

1050
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:21,220
I didn't really get to learn the system
as much as I would have liked,

1051
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:24,290
but I just let them do
what they wanted to do.

1052
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,220
Scotty comes to the dressing room
and said,

1053
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:30,300
"Guys, I don't know who teach you
to play this way,

1054
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,820
"but I wanna ask you one thing.

1055
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,446
"Don't change anything."

1056
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,282
...on game one
of the Stanley Cup Finals...

1057
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,380
I start looking for Igor right away.

1058
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,881
And I said, "Igor, we'll go together."

1059
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:01,365
It's true American dream, you know?

1060
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:11,050
Afterwards, I went to Gary Bettman.
I said, "Gary, I need the cup in Moscow."

1061
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:13,580
He said, "You crazy? We'll never
let the cup go to Moscow.

1062
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:16,260
"It's mafia. It's a bad country."

1063
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:19,250
I said, "Listen, I want the cup
to be in Moscow."

1064
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,180
He said, "Slava, it's impossible."

1065
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:25,443
I said, "What do you mean impossible?"

1066
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:34,260
It's great to be home.

1067
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:37,460
For me, the Red Army Club
is home, of course.

1068
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:40,620
I started here when I was 8 years old,

1069
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,166
and I left when I was 31.

1070
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,780
It's very strange.

1071
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,540
When you're born in the Soviet Union,

1072
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:50,928
and you left one country
and come back to another.

1073
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,244
It does not feel comfortable, you know?

1074
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:59,780
When I get back to Moscow,

1075
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,140
it's totally different.

1076
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:03,620
Different mentality.

1077
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,420
Different culture.

1078
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,568
Different... Everything's different.

1079
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:10,940
That capitalism has taken root here
is no longer in doubt,

1080
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,620
and some people are making
a great deal of money.

1081
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:16,140
But some of the problems
may be getting worse.

1082
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:17,940
In Moscow and Leningrad,

1083
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:20,860
many are turning their hand
at making a fast buck.

1084
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,980
Operating outside the legal boundaries

1085
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,811
is often more effective
than operating within them.

1086
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:31,180
Russians don't like
the corruption in this country.

1087
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,460
They feel that they're
not protected by the courts.

1088
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:37,260
They feel that the police,
just regular police,

1089
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,442
can pretty much do
what they want with you.

1090
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,620
Country's got no heroes. Got no system.

1091
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:45,020
No structure. Nothing.

1092
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,180
Everybody runs around
trying to get something.

1093
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,860
It's not the way I want to live.

1094
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,089
Everything is about the material
side of things: money, finance.

1095
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:59,020
Our country's crisis
is now reflected in hockey.

1096
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:02,260
With the first selection,
the Atlanta Thrashers

1097
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:05,330
are pleased to select,
from the Russian Division I,

1098
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,540
Spartak Moscow...

1099
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:08,700
Ilya Kovalchuk.

1100
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,020
Nail Yakupov.

1101
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,804
Alexander Ovechkin.

1102
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:18,602
Teams have very little money to
keep players from leaving.

1103
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,080
Yo, it's Alexander Ovechkin.
I am going to red carpet.

1104
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:31,683
We kinda forget about the patriotism.

1105
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,167
We are ashamed of what we were before.

1106
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:37,220
We are gonna test
Alexander Ovechkin's shooting accuracy

1107
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:40,260
by filling up these Russian dolls
with Russian dressing,

1108
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,249
and he's gonna drill them
with these hockey pucks.

1109
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:48,086
We lost something.

1110
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,961
We lost our pride.

1111
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,860
We lost...

1112
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:59,440
Our soul.

1113
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,620
But would you rather
it be the Soviet Union again?

1114
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,420
You know, like, would you have rather

1115
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,683
that not happened,
even though you kind of left?

1116
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:17,620
Gabe...

1117
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:20,260
It's not a proper question.

1118
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,820
I'm a politician now.

1119
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:25,940
I get my feeling
twenty years ago, right?

1120
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,580
I was sad.

1121
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,700
I played for the country for many years.

1122
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,770
I was proud to play and
be captain of the national team.

1123
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,260
When Putin invited me it was 2002.

1124
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:44,046
It's 11 years it's no Soviet Union.

1125
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:48,291
President Putin said,
"Slava, it's enough.

1126
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:51,605
"Get back home."

1127
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,324
Vladimir Putin gave me the position
of Minister of Sport.

1128
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,521
Sport should be a way of life.

1129
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,005
I'm a little guy in a big system,
but I try to do my best.

1130
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,660
The people who are running this country,

1131
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,140
born in the Soviet Union,
went to Soviet schools,

1132
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:26,740
were members of the Komsomol.

1133
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:30,020
They were created, shaped,
by the Soviet system.

1134
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,610
That's who they are.

1135
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:36,846
Much of the problems are still anchored
in that past.

1136
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,330
And they're not gonna go away...
Like this.

1137
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:45,300
It's a huge amount of work.

1138
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:48,847
It's twenty hours working day.
Every day.

1139
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,740
Y'know, we got lots of problems.

1140
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,540
I need to build infrastructure.

1141
01:15:58,640 --> 01:15:59,780
I need to find the money.

1142
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:02,740
I need to think about my people now.

1143
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:04,780
The kids, the veterans...

1144
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:08,726
Try to build something good
out of what's happened.

1145
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:14,321
We built a junior league.

1146
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,641
We built 300 new skating arenas.

1147
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:24,643
We brought the Olympic Games to Sochi.

1148
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,721
We are happy to be back in our country.

1149
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,330
I think our country and people need us.

1150
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,940
We went through a lot,

1151
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:00,100
and I'm happy today we are
again like brothers.

1152
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,521
Very close friends.

1153
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:06,740
We're friends.

1154
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:12,722
It's very important to get the people
you went through a lot with next to you.

1155
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,646
It's better than finding somebody else.

1156
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,580
We're still friends.

1157
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,409
And when we played, we were even closer.

1158
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:29,120
I dream about how we
used to play together.

1159
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:19,327
First, a round of applause
for this great Soviet coach.

1160
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:23,860
The word "great" hardly begins
to describe this great coach!

1161
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:28,124
Unfortunately, Viktor says
he's unable to talk today.

1162
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,700
The most important thing for me

1163
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:53,020
is to stress to the kids how it's
important to be teammates.

1164
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,140
How important to do stuff collectively.

1165
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:58,562
To be proud of what team you play on.

1166
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,241
I played 23 professional years.

1167
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:36,485
One thousand eight hundred plus games.

1168
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:43,368
I never had fun more than
playing with those five guys, together.

1169
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,321
When you die,
this is gonna be your legacy.

1170
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:56,260
I know and I appreciate it.
You're a good guy.

1171
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:59,220
I'm lucky to have you.

1172
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:02,660
I think we're both lucky
to have each other.

1173
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,206
That's even better.

1174
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,368
California boy, and a good guy.

1175
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:18,766
Chicago.

1175
01:20:19,305 --> 01:21:19,581

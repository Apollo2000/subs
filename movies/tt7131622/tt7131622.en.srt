00:00:36,442 --> 00:00:39,575
<i>This man is worth $500,</i>

3
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:42,076
<i>and this man's
going to collect.</i>

4
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,609
<i>He's Jake Cahill,</i>

5
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:45,109
<i>and he lives by...</i>

6
00:00:45,243 --> 00:00:46,942
Bounty Law.

7
00:00:47,076 --> 00:00:49,742
You don't ever bring them in
alive, do you, Jake?

8
00:00:49,876 --> 00:00:52,243
Not when there's three of them
and one of me.

9
00:00:57,475 --> 00:00:58,942
What are you looking at,
bounty killer?

10
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:00,442
I'm looking
at an ugly owl-hoot

11
00:01:00,575 --> 00:01:02,942
about to get his jaw busted.

12
00:01:03,076 --> 00:01:05,143
Amateurs try
and take men in alive.

13
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:09,375
Amateurs usually
don't make it.

14
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:11,375
<i>Whether you're dead or alive,</i>

15
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:15,076
<i>you're just a dollar sign</i>
<i>to Jake Cahill on</i> Bounty Law.

16
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:17,776
<i>Thursdays at 8:30,
only on NBC.</i>

17
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:23,143
Hello, everybody.

18
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:24,475
This is Allen Kincade

19
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:26,475
on the set
of the exciting hit NBC

20
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:28,976
and Screen Gems television
series <i>Bounty Law.</i>

21
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:30,909
Now, if you think
you're seeing double,

22
00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:32,542
don't adjust
your television sets

23
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,742
because, well,
in a way, you are.

24
00:01:34,876 --> 00:01:36,709
To my right
is <i>Bounty Law</i> series lead

25
00:01:36,842 --> 00:01:39,042
and Jake Cahill himself,
Rick Dalton.

26
00:01:39,176 --> 00:01:41,942
And to my left is Rick's
stunt double, Cliff Booth.

27
00:01:42,076 --> 00:01:43,809
Welcome and thanks for
taking the time

28
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:46,275
- to visit with us.
- It's our pleasure, Allen.

29
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:48,176
So, Rick,
explain to the audience

30
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,642
exactly what it is
a stunt double does.

31
00:01:51,575 --> 00:01:53,109
Well...

32
00:01:53,243 --> 00:01:56,243
actors are required to do
a lot of dangerous stuff.

33
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:59,308
Say Jake Cahill
gets shot off his horse.

34
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:01,642
Now, can I fall off
a horse?

35
00:02:01,776 --> 00:02:04,442
Yes, I can,
and, yes, I have.

36
00:02:07,942 --> 00:02:10,709
But say I fall off wrong
and I sprain my wrist

37
00:02:10,842 --> 00:02:12,275
or I... or I
twist my ankle.

38
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:15,408
Now, that can put
an undue burden on production

39
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:17,609
because now maybe
I can't work for a week.

40
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:20,442
So Cliff here is meant to help
carry the load.

41
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:22,942
Is that how you'd describe
your job, Cliff?

42
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:26,176
What, carrying his load?
Yeah, that's about right.

43
00:02:30,475 --> 00:02:33,076
Join me next week on the set
of <i>The Dick Van Dyke Show,</i>

44
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:35,042
where I'll be talking
to comical cutups,

45
00:02:35,176 --> 00:02:36,776
Morey Amsterdam
and Rose Marie.

46
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:40,143
Till then, this is Allen Kincade
signing off from Hollywood.

47
00:03:56,475 --> 00:03:58,776
Hi. I missed you.

48
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,842
The black one.
And the flowers.

49
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:06,308
Flowers, Ava, flowers.

50
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:07,809
And there's the small one.

51
00:04:07,942 --> 00:04:09,243
Can I see your tickets?

52
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,809
Oh, good boy.

53
00:05:11,243 --> 00:05:13,776
Gina, Gina, Gina.

54
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:15,575
The face
in the misty light.

55
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:18,642
- Hello, Mr. Schwarz.
- Hello, Gina.

56
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:22,776
I, uh... I have a meeting
with a very handsome cowboy man.

57
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,734
He's waiting
for you in the bar.

58
00:06:01,467 --> 00:06:02,334
Ah.

59
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:03,968
Well...

60
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,834
since I just finished
watching

61
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:08,133
a Rick Dalton
fucking film festival,

62
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,934
I think I know who you are.
Put it there.

63
00:06:11,068 --> 00:06:13,500
Well, it's my pleasure,
Mr. Schwartz.

64
00:06:13,634 --> 00:06:15,434
And thank you
for taking an interest.

65
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:17,100
<i>Schwarz,</i> not Schwartz.

66
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:20,068
Ah. G-goddamn it to hell.
I'm-I'm sorry about that.

67
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,267
- It's my pleasure, Mr. Schwarz.
- Call me Marvin.

68
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,968
Marvin, call me Rick.

69
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,400
- Rick?
- Yeah.

70
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:28,534
- Oh, is that your son?
- My son?

71
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:31,068
No, that's my stunt double,
Cliff Booth. Yeah.

72
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,968
- Good to meet you.
- We've worked together

73
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,968
since the last two seasons
of <i>Bounty Law.</i>

74
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,300
- Yeah?
- My car's in the shop,

75
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:37,734
so he gave me a ride.

76
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:39,434
<i>That's a big fucking lie.</i>

77
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:41,400
<i>Rick got his driver's license
taken away</i>

78
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,100
<i>for too many
drunk-driving tickets.</i>

79
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:44,667
<i>Cliff drives him
everywhere now.</i>

80
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:45,934
Oh, fuck.

81
00:06:46,068 --> 00:06:47,534
Well, sounds
like a good friend.

82
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:49,601
- I try.
- Mm.

83
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:52,367
I wanna send you greetings
from my wife,

84
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,400
Mary Alice <i>Schwarz.</i>

85
00:06:54,534 --> 00:06:56,934
Oh, well, that's nice.

86
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:00,400
Thanks a lot.

87
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:05,500
We had a Rick Dalton
double feature

88
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,300
in our screening room
last night.

89
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:11,601
Oh, well, that's both
flattering and-and embarrassing.

90
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:13,300
What'd you see?

91
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:16,300
Thirty-five mm prints
of <i>Tanner</i>

92
00:07:16,434 --> 00:07:18,734
and <i>The Fourteen Fists</i>
<i>of McCluskey.</i>

93
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:28,200
I hope the, uh,
Rick Dalton double feature

94
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:31,434
wasn't too painful for you
and the... And the missus.

95
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:35,567
Oh, no. "Painful." Stop.
What are you saying?

96
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,734
<i>Mary Alice loves Westerns.</i>

97
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:40,734
<i>Our whole courtship,
we watched Westerns.</i>

98
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:42,467
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

99
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:44,734
<i>And we thoroughly
enjoyed</i> Tanner.

100
00:07:44,867 --> 00:07:46,167
Oh, that's nice.

101
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,434
It's really good.
And anyway, she goes to bed.

102
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:51,601
<i>I open up a box of Havanas.</i>

103
00:07:51,734 --> 00:07:58,068
<i>I light up, I pour myself
a cognac and I watch...</i>

104
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,634
<i>The Fourteen Fists
of McCluskey.</i>

105
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,400
What a picture.

106
00:08:02,534 --> 00:08:04,267
- What a picture.
- Good picture, yeah.

107
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,167
That is so much fun.

108
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,334
All the shooting.

109
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:13,001
I love that stuff.
You know, the killing.

110
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:15,100
A lot of killing.
Lot of killing, yeah.

111
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:18,934
Now, gentlemen,
the plan is, we reverse our forces

112
00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:22,034
<i>und</i> drive the Allies
back into the sea!

113
00:08:24,901 --> 00:08:26,100
Genius.

114
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:27,867
Panzer divisions come in,

115
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:30,534
and we drive them here
to the ocean.

116
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:32,034
They'll be up against
the wall.

117
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:34,233
- They will have nowhere to go.
- Yes.

118
00:08:34,367 --> 00:08:36,567
This is the spot...

119
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:38,934
Hermann!

120
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:41,968
Open the curtains.

121
00:09:01,734 --> 00:09:04,767
Anybody order
fried sauerkraut?

122
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:25,068
Burn, you Nazi bastards!
Ha-ha-ha!

123
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,068
That's you operating
the flamethrower, isn't it?

124
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,100
Oh, you bet your sweet ass
it was. Yeah.

125
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:33,001
- It was you?
- Yeah. And let me tell you,

126
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:35,167
that-that's one shit-fuck
crazy weapon

127
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,467
y-y-you do not wanna be
on the wrong side of.

128
00:09:37,601 --> 00:09:38,968
Boy, oh, boy.

129
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,867
You know, I practiced
with that dragon, uh,

130
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:43,767
three hours a day
for two weeks.

131
00:09:43,901 --> 00:09:45,634
Not just because
I wanted to look good

132
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:47,400
in the picture,
but because I was...

133
00:09:47,534 --> 00:09:49,601
I was shit-scared
of the thing, to be honest.

134
00:09:50,534 --> 00:09:52,133
Mike fucking Lewis!

135
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:53,801
Crisping them Nazis
to hell!

136
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:55,467
Oh, shit, that's...

137
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:57,100
All right,
that's too hot.

138
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:59,233
Anything we can do
about that heat?

139
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:01,968
- Rick, it's a flamethrower.
- Yeah.

140
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,300
So I came to the office
early today,

141
00:10:05,434 --> 00:10:10,968
and I watched two episodes
of <i>Bounty Law</i> on 16 mm.

142
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,801
Jody Janice,

143
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:15,300
wanted for cattle rustling
in the state of Wyoming,

144
00:10:15,434 --> 00:10:18,634
$425 dead or alive.

145
00:10:19,968 --> 00:10:22,233
And you brought him here
to collect.

146
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:24,968
I don't even know
where here is.

147
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,167
It was just
the closest place.

148
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,100
Caught up with him about
five miles outside of town.

149
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:32,167
So, bounty killer,

150
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,667
the name of this town
is Janicetown.

151
00:10:37,968 --> 00:10:39,734
And that boy you killed...

152
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:43,100
was Jody Janice.

153
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:47,267
He was the baby boy
of Major Nathin Maxwell Janice.

154
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,200
Hmm.

155
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:53,200
Who's
Major Nathin Maxwell Janice?

156
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:58,734
Well, I'll be sure
and introduce you

157
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,968
when he gets here.

158
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:21,801

So, uh, you've been doing
guest shots

169
00:11:59,601 --> 00:12:02,267
on episodic TV shows
the last couple of years?

170
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:08,200
Yeah. Yeah. I'm doing a pilot
f-for CBS right now.

171
00:12:08,334 --> 00:12:10,767
It's called... It's called
<i>Lancer.</i> I play the heavy.

172
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:13,400
Did a, ahem,
Ron Ely <i>Tarzan.</i>

173
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:16,434
I did a <i>Land of the Giants.</i>
<i>Green Hornet.</i>

174
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:18,434
I did that show, uh...

175
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:21,834
<i>Bingo Martin</i> with that kid
Scott Brown. Yeah.

176
00:12:21,968 --> 00:12:25,233
And I got a <i>F.B.I.</i>
that-that airs this Sunday.

177
00:12:25,367 --> 00:12:28,934
You, um... You always play
the bad guy on these shows?

178
00:12:29,068 --> 00:12:31,767
- Y-yeah. Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

179
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:34,667
So, and they have a fight scene
at the end of them?

180
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:36,434
Well, not... Not...

181
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38,834
Not <i>Land of the Giants</i>
or <i>F.B.I.,</i>

182
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:41,901
- but the rest, yeah. Yeah.
- And you lose in the fight?

183
00:12:42,034 --> 00:12:45,701
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
I'm... I'm the heavy.

184
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:49,968
Oh, that's an old trick
pulled by the networks.

185
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,968
Now, you take <i>Bingo Martin,</i>
for example.

186
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,601
- Mm-hm.
- Right?

187
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:56,601
So you got a new guy
like Scott Brown.

188
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,767
You wanna build up
his bona fides, right?

189
00:12:59,901 --> 00:13:02,100
So you hire a guy
from a canceled show

190
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:03,767
- to play the heavy.
- Hmm.

191
00:13:03,901 --> 00:13:07,034
Then at the end of the show,
when they fight,

192
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,968
it's hero besting heavy.

193
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,601
But what the audience sees

194
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:16,601
is Bingo Martin
whipping Jake Cahill's ass.

195
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:18,267
- Uh-huh.
- You see?

196
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,667
Then next week,
it's Ron Ely.

197
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,133
And next week,
it's Bob Conrad,

198
00:13:25,267 --> 00:13:28,167
wearing his tight pants,
kicking your ass.

199
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,567
Yeah.

200
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:33,233
Now, in another couple of years,
playing punching bag

201
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:36,434
to every swinging dick
new to the network,

202
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,567
that's gonna have
a psychological effect

203
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:42,100
on how the audience
perceives you.

204
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:43,667
Right.

205
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:45,634
So, Rick,

206
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:48,567
who's gonna kick the shit
out of you next week?

207
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:51,634
Mannix?
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.?

208
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:53,701
The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.?

209
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,034
How about
Batman and Robin?

210
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:57,767
Ping. Pow.

211
00:13:57,901 --> 00:13:59,767
Choom. Zoom.

212
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:03,133
Down goes you.

213
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:06,767
Down goes your career
as a leading man.

214
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:14,567
Or do you go to Rome
and star in Westerns

215
00:14:14,701 --> 00:14:17,534
and win fucking fights?

216
00:14:24,068 --> 00:14:25,601
Ticket, señor?

217
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:35,334
All right,
what's the matter, partner?

218
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:37,801
Well...

219
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:41,467
it's official, old buddy.
I'm a has-been.

220
00:14:41,601 --> 00:14:44,167
What are you talking about?
What did that guy tell you?

221
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,634
He told me the goddamn truth,
is what he told me.

222
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:50,934
- Oh. Whoa.
- Oh, shit.

223
00:14:51,068 --> 00:14:52,734
- Hey.
- I'm sorry about that.

224
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:53,734
Sorry about that.

225
00:14:53,867 --> 00:14:55,534
Here. Put these on.

226
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:57,233
Don't cry
in front of the Mexicans.

227
00:14:57,367 --> 00:15:00,133
- Son of a bitch.
- What's got you so upset, man?

228
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,534
Well, if coming face-to-face
with the failure

229
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:04,734
that is your career
ain't worth crying about,

230
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:06,467
then I don't know
what the fuck is.

231
00:15:06,601 --> 00:15:08,534
Right. That guy in there
turn you down?

232
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:11,634
No. He wants to help me
get into Italian movies.

233
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:13,467
Then what's the problem?

234
00:15:13,601 --> 00:15:15,267
I gotta do
Italian goddamn movies!

235
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,100
- That's the fucking problem!
- Come on.

236
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:20,200
Fucking bullshit! It doesn't
matter whether I cry in public.

237
00:15:20,334 --> 00:15:22,500
Nobody remembers
who the fuck I am anyway, huh?

269

Ten years of-of-of
treading water.

270
00:16:51,267 --> 00:16:55,267
And now a race
to the bottom. Heh.

271
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,601
Look, I never had much
of a career to speak of,

272
00:16:57,734 --> 00:17:00,867
so I can't say I really know
how you feel.

273
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:03,367
What are you talking about?
You're my stunt double.

274
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,968
Come on, now. Shit.

275
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,467
Rick, I'm your driver, man.
I'm-I'm your gofer.

276
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:11,133
I'm not complaining, man.
I like driving you around.

277
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:12,901
I like doing shit
around the house

278
00:17:13,034 --> 00:17:14,867
and house-sitting
in the Hollywood Hills

279
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:17,300
when you're gone.

280
00:17:17,434 --> 00:17:19,233
But I haven't been
a full-time stuntman

281
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:20,934
for a while now,

282
00:17:21,068 --> 00:17:22,701
and from where I'm standing,

283
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,934
going to Rome to star
in movies does not sound

284
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:27,901
like the fate worse than death
that you seem to think it is.

285
00:17:28,034 --> 00:17:32,233
Come on, now. You ever seen
an-an Italian Western, huh?

286
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:34,467
They're awful.
It's a fucking farce.

287
00:17:34,601 --> 00:17:37,068
Yeah, how many you seen?
One? Two?

288
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,267
I've seen enough, all right?
Nobody likes Spaghetti Westerns.

289
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,934
Oh, hell, man,
stay in L.A.

290
00:18:39,068 --> 00:18:40,634
Give it what fer
next pilot season.

291
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,901
Nah, nah. I'm... I'm...

292
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:46,133
I'm too insecure now
to score come pilot season.

293
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:49,100
Screen Gems ain't gonna have
nothing good to say about me.

294
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:51,133
- You know that.
- Shit. You made <i>Bounty Law.</i>

295
00:18:51,267 --> 00:18:53,467
Nobody's gonna forgive me
for that last season.

296
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:55,001
- No matter what I do...
- Ah...

297
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,934
...I'm always gonna be
the horse's ass

298
00:18:57,068 --> 00:18:58,667
that got <i>Bounty Law</i> canceled

299
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:02,567
because I wanted some fucking
rinky-dink movie career.

300
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:07,034
- Tom. My friend.
- I met him?

301
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:08,434
No, you haven't met him.

302
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:10,400
You won't meet him
because I don't think

303
00:19:10,534 --> 00:19:11,434
- you'd like him.
- Why?

304
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,068
Well...

305
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:18,767
- Don't even joke.
- A joke? But they're scared.

306
00:19:31,968 --> 00:19:33,934
Holy shit. Heh.

307
00:19:34,068 --> 00:19:36,467
That was Polanski.

308
00:19:36,601 --> 00:19:38,100
That was Roman Polanski.

309
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:40,467
He's lived there
for a month now.

310
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:42,968
First time I seen him.
Ha-ha-ha.

311
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,068
Holy shit. Goddamn it.

312
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:49,300
What do I always say?

313
00:19:49,434 --> 00:19:51,133
Most important thing
in this town is,

314
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:53,601
when you're making money,
you buy a house in town.

315
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,300
You don't rent.
Eddie O'Brien taught me that.

316
00:19:56,434 --> 00:19:58,500
Hollywood real estate
means you live here.

317
00:19:58,634 --> 00:20:02,034
You're not just visiting,
not just passing through.

318
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,200
You fucking live here.

319
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:05,901
Here I am flat
on my ass,

320
00:20:06,034 --> 00:20:08,068
and who I got living
next door to me?

321
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,068
The director of <i>Rosemary's</i>
fucking <i>Baby,</i> that's who.

322
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,467
Polanski, the hottest director
in town right now,

323
00:20:13,601 --> 00:20:14,867
probably the world.

324
00:20:15,001 --> 00:20:16,968
He's my next-door neighbor.

325
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,034
I mean, shit. I mean,
who knows what could happen?

326
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:22,701
I could... I could be
one pool party away

327
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:24,734
f-from starring
in a new Polanski movie.

328
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:26,200
So you're feeling better
now?

329
00:20:26,334 --> 00:20:28,100
Aw, yeah, yeah.
Sorry about all that.

330
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:29,901
Give me my glasses back.

331
00:20:30,034 --> 00:20:31,968
Oh, come get them, fucker.
Come...

332
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,300
All right, all right,
Audie Murphy, relax.

333
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,801
- There you go.
- You need me for anything else?

334
00:20:36,934 --> 00:20:39,767
Nah, nah, nah. I got a lot
of lines to learn for tomorrow.

335
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:41,100
- Shit. All right.
- All right.

336
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:42,734
I'm gonna get my carcass
on home.

337
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,801
- All right.
- All right, 7:15 a.m.

338
00:20:44,934 --> 00:20:46,601
- Seven-fifteen.
- Out the door.

339
00:20:46,734 --> 00:20:48,068
- Out the door.
- In the car.

340
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,233
All right,
see you then.

341
00:23:41,434 --> 00:23:44,267
Hello, coming in. Hello.

342
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,267
Hello, darling. Hello.

343
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,567
Mm. Mm.

344
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:50,334
Come here.

345
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:52,467
Hello, sweetheart.

346
00:23:52,601 --> 00:23:55,901
Mm. How was your day?
Hmm?

347
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,801
Wait till you see
what I got for you.

348
00:23:57,934 --> 00:24:01,233
Wait until you see
what I got for you.

349
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:03,334
Look what I got for you.

350
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:04,934
Gonna blow your mind, man.

351
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,068
Come here. Come here.

352
00:24:13,267 --> 00:24:16,200
Ta, ta, ta. Oh!

353
00:25:16,034 --> 00:25:17,567
Was that a whine?

354
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:20,534
What did I tell you
about whining?

355
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:22,034
You whine, you don't eat.

356
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:23,867
I will throw this shit
in the trash.

357
00:25:24,001 --> 00:25:25,400
I don't wanna, but I will.

358
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:27,701
You understand?

359
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:30,400
All right.

360
00:26:05,801 --> 00:26:08,267
<i>I waited at
the bar till closing time,</i>

361
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,934
<i>but he never came back.</i>

362
00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:13,334
<i>Okay, Peggy, what happened?</i>

363
00:26:13,467 --> 00:26:16,100
<i>I don't know.
Everything was fine.</i>

364
00:26:16,233 --> 00:26:17,867
<i>We had dinner at my house.</i>

365
00:26:18,001 --> 00:26:19,434
<i>And afterwards, you know,</i>

366
00:26:19,567 --> 00:26:21,367
- <i>while I was doing the dishes,</i>
- Tsk, tsk.

367
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,801
<i>he and Tobey played.</i>

368
00:26:23,934 --> 00:26:25,968
<i>And then, at the club,
Gabe was doing great.</i>

369
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,233
<i>Then, wham, a sudden change.</i>

370
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:31,734
<i>You know how musicians are.
They're temperamental cats.</i>

371
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:33,767
- <i>Who knows what got into him?</i>
- Yeah.

372
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:44,133
<i>Rick Dalton rehearsal
tape starting in five, four,</i>

373
00:26:44,267 --> 00:26:46,834
<i>three, two, one.</i>

374
00:26:46,968 --> 00:26:51,267
Pepe, get your behind
behind that bar! I got a guest.

375
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,834
<i>Johnny says...</i>

376
00:26:52,968 --> 00:26:56,001
<i>Spanish, Spanish, Spanish.</i>

377
00:26:56,133 --> 00:26:57,434
<i>How's the beans?</i>

378
00:26:57,567 --> 00:26:58,601
I've had worse.

379
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,767
<i>Johnny says... Spanish.</i>

380
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:04,400
<i>A toast.</i>

381
00:27:04,534 --> 00:27:06,901
To my wife
and all my sweethearts.

382
00:27:07,034 --> 00:27:09,601
May they never meet.

383
00:27:09,734 --> 00:27:12,233
Señor Madrid,
care to join me at my table

384
00:27:12,367 --> 00:27:15,233
where I entertain my guests?

385
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,434
<i>I would be
delighted, Monsieur Dakota.</i>

386
00:27:20,068 --> 00:27:22,801
Take the bottle with you.

387
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:24,968
<i>And Pepe comes over.</i>

388
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,434
Hey, where's that chili pepper
daughter of yours

389
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:28,934
with the fiddle?

390
00:27:29,068 --> 00:27:30,901
<i>She's asleep.</i>

391
00:27:31,034 --> 00:27:33,100
Well, wake her the heck up,
get her down here

392
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:36,300
with her fiddle and her bow,
and entertain my guests.

393
00:27:36,434 --> 00:27:38,934
<i>Sí, señor,
but please don't hurt her this time,</i>

394
00:27:39,068 --> 00:27:40,034
<i>I beg you.</i>

395
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:41,634
I ain't gonna hurt her.

396
00:27:41,767 --> 00:27:43,534
Just want her
to play the fiddle.

397
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:45,267
Fetch her and tell her
I'll give her

398
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,634
a fat $5 gold piece,

399
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:49,667
she play her little chili pepper
heart out.

400
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,734
So, Johnny, what else
you heard about me?

401
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:55,634
<i>I heard you're
pushing Lancer pretty hard,</i>

402
00:27:55,767 --> 00:27:57,500
<i>but Lancer has money.</i>

403
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:02,133
<i>At some point, he's gonna hire
some guns and push back.</i>

404
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:05,634
- Oops, sorry.
- It's okay.

405
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,934
I'll open the door for you.

406
00:28:08,068 --> 00:28:09,667
You look good.

407
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,867
I think Steve's
gonna be there too.

408
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:24,968
Oh, yeah.

409
00:29:39,034 --> 00:29:41,100
Oh, look. They're here.

410
00:29:55,867 --> 00:29:58,601
Welcome to the Playboy
Mansion, Mr. Polanski.

411
00:29:58,734 --> 00:30:01,734
Hey, how are you doing,
baby?

412
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:04,634
Hey! Heh. How are you?

413
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:19,801
Oh, Cass!

414
00:30:31,567 --> 00:30:33,300
Yeah!

415
00:30:38,767 --> 00:30:40,100
Yeah, baby!

416
00:30:42,867 --> 00:30:45,867
Yeah! Whoo! Whoo!

417
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:56,267
Oh, yeah.

418
00:31:29,034 --> 00:31:32,034
I'm gonna tell you a story.

419
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:34,901
She was engaged to him.

420
00:31:38,068 --> 00:31:44,133
Then she flew
to the UK...

421
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:46,434
to make a film
with him,

422
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:52,100
and broke off her engagement
with him and married him.

423
00:31:53,534 --> 00:31:57,233
Then they moved
to Los Angeles,

424
00:31:57,367 --> 00:31:59,434
and the three of them

425
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:01,400
have been inseparable.

426
00:32:01,534 --> 00:32:03,767
Really?

427
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,968
What's up?

428
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:12,001
Jay loves Sharon,
that's what's up.

429
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:15,167
- Mm.
- And he knows...

430
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,567
as sure as God made
little green apples...

431
00:32:20,133 --> 00:32:22,133
that one of these days,
that Polish prick's

432
00:32:22,267 --> 00:32:23,567
gonna fuck things up,

433
00:32:23,701 --> 00:32:26,934
and when he does,
Jay's gonna be there.

434
00:32:27,068 --> 00:32:29,300
Well, one thing's
for sure.

435
00:32:29,434 --> 00:32:31,100
Yeah?

436
00:32:31,233 --> 00:32:32,434
What's that?

437
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:36,068
Sharon absolutely has a type.

438
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,434
Cute, short, talented guys

439
00:32:39,567 --> 00:32:42,367
who look
like 12-year-old boys.

440
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,300
Yeah.

441
00:32:47,934 --> 00:32:50,233
I never stood a chance.

442
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,500
Argh. Fuck you,
Dr. Sapirstein.

443
00:34:15,068 --> 00:34:16,601
Oh, here we are.

444
00:34:19,133 --> 00:34:23,500
Tell transpo!
Gonna need to move all that out!

445
00:34:23,634 --> 00:34:26,133
Just a sec. Hold on, guys.

446
00:34:26,267 --> 00:34:27,133
Go ahead.

447
00:34:30,634 --> 00:34:32,500
You can talk to him.
Just talk to him.

448
00:34:32,634 --> 00:34:34,634
- Get that set in place.
- Hey.

449
00:34:34,767 --> 00:34:38,434
Ahem. I think the wind blew
down my TV antenna last night,

450
00:34:38,567 --> 00:34:41,267
so while I piss-fart
around with wardrobe,

451
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,934
you mind going home
and fixing it?

452
00:34:43,068 --> 00:34:45,901
I can. You talk to
the stunt gaffer about me today?

453
00:34:46,034 --> 00:34:48,400
That way I'll know
if I'm working this week or not.

454
00:34:48,534 --> 00:34:50,701
Yeah. Ahem.
I've been meaning to tell you.

455
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:54,934
The guy who gaffs this,
he's best friends with Randy,

456
00:34:55,068 --> 00:34:56,601
the gaffer
from <i>The Green Hornet...</i>

457
00:34:56,734 --> 00:34:58,968
...so there ain't no point.

458
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,467
If you don't need me,
I'll pick you up at wrap.

459
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:03,801
I don't need you. Not today.

460
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:07,767
Go home, fix my antenna,
do whatever. See you at wrap.

461
00:35:10,434 --> 00:35:12,500
Hey!

462
00:35:12,634 --> 00:35:15,801
You're Rick fucking Dalton.
Don't you forget it.

463
00:35:25,934 --> 00:35:27,068
Hey, hey.

464
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,500
Hey, buddy,
I'm Rick Dalton.

465
00:35:28,634 --> 00:35:30,167
You know
where I'm supposed to go?

466
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,434
They're waiting for you
in the makeup trailer.

467
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:34,267
Where's the makeup trailer?

468
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,467
Straight back the way you came,
hard right.

469
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,467
Oh, my God.

470
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:50,634
Rick Dalton.

471
00:35:50,767 --> 00:35:52,034
Sam Wanamaker.

472
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:53,634
Hey, Sam.

473
00:35:53,767 --> 00:35:54,901
Sorry about the wet hand.

474
00:35:55,034 --> 00:35:56,901
Oh, don't worry.
I'm used to it with Yul.

475
00:35:57,034 --> 00:35:59,434
I want you to know,
I'm the one who cast you.

476
00:35:59,567 --> 00:36:02,233
And I couldn't be more
delighted you're doing this.

477
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:03,534
Oh, well, thank you, Sam.

478
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:06,100
I... I appreciate it.
It's a good part.

479
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:09,133
Yeah, it is. Have you met
Jim Stacy, the series lead?

480
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,567
Uh, not yet, no. No.

481
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:13,434
Well, you guys are going
to be dynamite together.

482
00:36:13,567 --> 00:36:14,500
Mm. Mm.

483
00:36:14,634 --> 00:36:16,934
Well, it sounds exciting.

484
00:36:17,068 --> 00:36:19,100
- Yeah, lightning in a bottle.
- Mm.

485
00:36:19,233 --> 00:36:21,334
Now, you met Sonya,
makeup and hair?

486
00:36:21,467 --> 00:36:22,634
Hi.

487
00:36:22,767 --> 00:36:24,734
And this is Rebekka,
who does costumes.

488
00:36:24,867 --> 00:36:26,267
Hello.

489
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,734
- Hi.
- Howdy.

490
00:36:27,867 --> 00:36:29,634
I want a whole
new look for Caleb.

491
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:31,267
I don't want this
Western costumed

492
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,001
the way they costumed
<i>The Big Valley</i>

493
00:36:33,133 --> 00:36:34,834
and <i>Bonanza</i>
for the last decade.

494
00:36:34,968 --> 00:36:37,567
I want a zeitgeist flair
to the costumes.

495
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,634
I mean,
nothing anachronistic,

496
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:44,968
but where does 1869
and 1969 meet?

497
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,634
Especially when it comes
to you, Caleb.

498
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:49,100
Mm. Mm.

499
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:51,100
First off,
I want to give him a mustache.

500
00:36:51,233 --> 00:36:55,801
A big, droopy,
Zapata-like mustache.

501
00:36:55,934 --> 00:36:57,934
Now, about his jacket.

502
00:36:58,068 --> 00:36:59,801
I want to give him
a hippie jacket.

503
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:02,334
Something he could wear
into the London Fog tonight

504
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:04,400
and look like the hippest guy
in the room.

505
00:37:04,534 --> 00:37:06,701
Far out.
We got a Custer jacket.

506
00:37:06,834 --> 00:37:08,400
Fringes all down the arm.

507
00:37:08,534 --> 00:37:11,300
It's tan now,
but I dye it dark brown,

508
00:37:11,434 --> 00:37:13,400
he could hit the Strip in it
tonight.

509
00:37:13,534 --> 00:37:15,500
That's my girl. Heh.

510
00:37:15,634 --> 00:37:18,467
- Now, Rick, about your hair.
- What about my hair?

511
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:20,434
I want to go
with a different hairstyle.

512
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:21,601
Huh. What?

513
00:37:21,734 --> 00:37:24,334
Something
more hippie-ish.

514
00:37:24,467 --> 00:37:27,734
You want me
to look like a hippie?

515
00:37:27,867 --> 00:37:30,834
Well, think less hippie,
more...

516
00:37:30,968 --> 00:37:32,001
Hells Angel!

517
00:37:34,767 --> 00:37:36,567
- Right. Say, Sam...
- Get me the...

518
00:37:36,701 --> 00:37:39,467
Sam. Sam, uh...

519
00:37:39,601 --> 00:37:41,467
if you got me covered up
in all this...

520
00:37:41,601 --> 00:37:43,901
this junk, uh,

521
00:37:44,034 --> 00:37:45,801
how's the audience
gonna know it's me?

522
00:37:46,901 --> 00:37:47,968
I hope they don't.

523
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,300
Mm.

524
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:53,801
I don't want them to see
Jake Cahill.

525
00:37:53,934 --> 00:37:56,767
I want them to see Caleb.

526
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:59,701
I hired you
to be an actor, Rick.

527
00:37:59,834 --> 00:38:02,968
Not a TV cowboy.
You're better than that.

528
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,133
<i>I've been meaning to tell
you, the guy who gaffs this,</i>

529
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,634
<i>he's best friends
with Randy,</i>

530
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:21,300
<i>the gaffer</i>
<i>from</i> The Green Hornet,

531
00:41:21,434 --> 00:41:23,767
<i>so there really
ain't no point.</i>

532
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,334
Hey, Randy.

533
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:44,634
Cliff.

534
00:41:44,767 --> 00:41:47,068
So you're still with Rick,
huh?

535
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,100
Still here.

536
00:41:49,601 --> 00:41:50,467
He in there?

537
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:52,634
Yeah. Just knock.

538
00:41:57,001 --> 00:41:59,801
Look, just put him
in the wardrobe, all right?

539
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,034
What's it gonna hurt?

540
00:42:01,167 --> 00:42:02,801
Then if you need him,
you got him.

541
00:42:02,934 --> 00:42:04,534
But then I gotta have
a conversation

542
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:06,233
with that
wardrobe assistant,

543
00:42:06,367 --> 00:42:09,133
- and, man, she's a fucking bitch.
- I just don't... Please, I...

544
00:42:09,267 --> 00:42:12,034
Look, Randy, I'm asking you
to help me out, man.

545
00:42:12,167 --> 00:42:13,867
If the answer's no,
the answer's no,

546
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:16,467
not no with excuses.

547
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:18,867
Hey, man.

548
00:42:19,001 --> 00:42:22,068
This ain't a fucking
Andy McLaglen picture, you know?

549
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,934
I can't afford to hire a bunch
of guys to smoke cigarettes

550
00:42:25,068 --> 00:42:27,100
and sit around talking
to each other all day

551
00:42:27,233 --> 00:42:28,834
on the chance
that I might use them.

552
00:42:28,968 --> 00:42:30,467
I got a four-man team here,
Rick.

553
00:42:30,601 --> 00:42:32,934
If I need more than that,
I gotta get it approved.

554
00:42:33,068 --> 00:42:35,500
And, you know,
I gotta look after my dudes.

555
00:42:35,634 --> 00:42:38,500
Hey, and if your dudes
were a better match for me,

556
00:42:38,634 --> 00:42:40,068
I'd say, "Okay, you got me,"

557
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,767
but-but that's not the case,
and you know it.

558
00:42:42,901 --> 00:42:44,968
- He's a great match for me.
- Yeah, no...

559
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,100
Hey, you could do
anything you want to him.

560
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:50,300
Throw him off a building, right?
Light him on fire.

561
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:52,233
Hit him with
a fucking Lincoln, right?

562
00:42:52,367 --> 00:42:53,934
Get creative.
Do whatever you want.

563
00:42:54,068 --> 00:42:55,734
He's just happy
for the opportunity.

564
00:42:55,867 --> 00:42:57,901
- Rick.
- Yeah?

565
00:43:00,068 --> 00:43:01,968
I don't dig him.

566
00:43:03,601 --> 00:43:06,934
And I don't dig the vibe
he brings on a set.

567
00:43:07,068 --> 00:43:09,734
What, is there some old beef
between the two of you?

568
00:43:09,867 --> 00:43:12,100
- Oh, come on, man.
- What? What?

569
00:43:12,233 --> 00:43:14,434
The dude killed
his fucking wife.

570
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,701
Come on, man. You don't believe
that old shit, do you?

571
00:43:19,834 --> 00:43:21,434
Yes, Rick, I do.

572
00:43:21,567 --> 00:43:24,601
And I work with my wife,
and she believes it.

573
00:43:24,734 --> 00:43:26,901
She doesn't want
his creepy ass around.

574
00:43:29,233 --> 00:43:30,767
You know, this is probably

575
00:43:30,901 --> 00:43:33,100
the shittiest weather ever.

576
00:43:33,233 --> 00:43:36,334
The shittiest weather
on the shittiest boat

577
00:43:36,467 --> 00:43:37,968
with the shittiest person.

578
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:43,267
Natalie, my sister, said,
"He's a loser. He's a loser."

579
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,334
They all said it,
"He's a fucking loser,"

580
00:43:45,467 --> 00:43:46,734
and I didn't believe them.

581
00:43:46,867 --> 00:43:49,801
So I guess
I'm the fucking idiot.

582
00:43:49,934 --> 00:43:51,567
And now you're not
gonna talk to me?

583
00:43:51,701 --> 00:43:53,968
What, you don't feel
like fighting?

584
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,734
Well, I feel like
fucking fighting

585
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:57,934
because I've been up here
by myself

586
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:01,634
for four hours on this
fucking shithole of a boat.

587
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:03,400
Yeah.

588
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:08,734
H-he's a goddamn
war hero. Fuck.

589
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:12,267
Yeah, appreciate it.

590
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,567
Okay, you fucking horse's ass.
Let's get you over to wardrobe.

591
00:44:24,233 --> 00:44:26,167
Now, I'll put you
in wardrobe,

592
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,901
but you don't stunt,
I don't pay you.

593
00:44:29,034 --> 00:44:31,934
Appreciate the opportunity,
Randy. I won't let you down.

594
00:44:32,068 --> 00:44:34,734
You know my wife Janet,
don't you?

595
00:44:34,867 --> 00:44:36,233
Yeah.

596
00:44:36,367 --> 00:44:38,567
Steer clear of her.

597
00:44:38,701 --> 00:44:41,901
Now, I admire
Cassius Clay, I do.

598
00:44:42,034 --> 00:44:44,267
What I admire is,
in his sport,

599
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,634
there's an element
of true combat.

600
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,334
When Cassius Clay meets
Sonny Liston in the ring,

601
00:44:49,467 --> 00:44:51,634
that's not two athletes
posturing.

602
00:44:51,767 --> 00:44:53,634
That's combat.

603
00:44:53,767 --> 00:44:56,934
Two men trying to kill
each other right now.

604
00:44:57,068 --> 00:44:59,100
If you don't beat him...

605
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:01,300
he kills you.

606
00:45:01,434 --> 00:45:03,034
That's beyond athletics.

607
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:06,734
That's beyond
<i>Wide World of Sports,</i> you know?

608
00:45:06,867 --> 00:45:08,734
That's two warriors
engaged in combat.

609
00:45:08,867 --> 00:45:11,300
That's what I admire.

610
00:45:11,434 --> 00:45:12,767
In martial arts tournaments,

611
00:45:12,901 --> 00:45:14,467
they won't let you fight
like that.

612
00:45:14,601 --> 00:45:16,601
It's very frustrating.

613
00:45:16,734 --> 00:45:18,034
You stand in front of a guy,

614
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:20,968
and you just wanna let him
have it. Ha!

615
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,634
But you can't.

616
00:45:22,767 --> 00:45:26,701
So you gotta do this
playacting, patty-cake version.

617
00:45:26,834 --> 00:45:29,934
Cassius Clay. Sonny Liston.
Joe Louis.

618
00:45:30,068 --> 00:45:31,133
The colored boxer,

619
00:45:31,267 --> 00:45:32,934
not that white
kickboxing asshole.

620
00:45:34,267 --> 00:45:36,968
They do what
they need to do to win.

621
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,001
They unleash
as much punishment

622
00:45:39,133 --> 00:45:41,467
as they have to
to defeat the other guy.

623
00:45:42,634 --> 00:45:44,267
But in martial arts
tournaments,

624
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,767
I do to win what
they do to win.

625
00:45:46,901 --> 00:45:49,801
I unleash all my power.

626
00:45:50,567 --> 00:45:52,233
I kill people.

627
00:45:52,367 --> 00:45:54,467
If you fought Cassius
Clay, who would win?

628
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:57,300
Well,
that would never happen.

629
00:45:57,434 --> 00:45:59,901
But if you did,
what do you think would happen?

630
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,434
I'd make him a cripple.

631
00:46:05,734 --> 00:46:08,567
Hey, you. What's your name?

632
00:46:08,701 --> 00:46:11,100
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

633
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,934
My name's Cliff.

634
00:46:14,068 --> 00:46:16,068
I'm Rick Dalton's
stunt double.

635
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,801
- Stuntman?
- Yeah.

636
00:46:18,934 --> 00:46:21,434
You know,
you're kind of pretty for a stuntman.

637
00:46:21,567 --> 00:46:23,300
That's what they tell me.

638
00:46:23,434 --> 00:46:27,300
So did I say something
funny, stuntman?

639
00:46:27,434 --> 00:46:30,467
- Yeah, you kind of did.
- What's so funny?

640
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:32,601
Look, man,
I don't want any trouble.

641
00:46:32,734 --> 00:46:34,133
I'm just here
to do a job.

642
00:46:34,267 --> 00:46:36,068
But you're laughing at
what I'm saying.

643
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,734
But I'm not saying
anything funny.

644
00:46:37,867 --> 00:46:40,167
So, what do you think
is so funny?

645
00:46:41,467 --> 00:46:43,601
What I think is...

646
00:46:45,801 --> 00:46:48,334
you're a little man
with a big mouth and a big chip,

647
00:46:48,467 --> 00:46:50,167
and I think you
should be embarrassed

648
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,434
to suggest you'd be
anything more than a stain

649
00:46:52,567 --> 00:46:55,334
on the seat
of Cassius Clay's trunks.

650
00:46:55,467 --> 00:46:58,300
Brother, you're the one
with the big mouth.

651
00:46:58,434 --> 00:47:00,100
And I would really
enjoy closing it,

652
00:47:00,233 --> 00:47:03,267
especially in front
of all my friends.

653
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,701
But my hands are registered
as lethal weapons.

654
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:09,100
That means,
we get into a fight,

655
00:47:09,233 --> 00:47:13,133
I accidentally kill you,
I go to jail.

656
00:47:13,267 --> 00:47:14,867
Anybody accidentally
kills anybody

657
00:47:15,001 --> 00:47:16,267
in a fight,
they go to jail.

658
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,801
It's called
manslaughter.

659
00:47:17,934 --> 00:47:20,068
And I think all that
"lethal weapon" horseshit

660
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,701
is just an excuse
so you dancers

661
00:47:21,834 --> 00:47:23,968
never have to get
in a real fight.

662
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,100
Okay.

663
00:47:27,334 --> 00:47:29,133
How about
a friendly contest?

664
00:47:30,367 --> 00:47:32,267
No punching in the face.

665
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,934
Two out of three.

666
00:47:34,068 --> 00:47:36,068
Who puts who
on the ground first?

667
00:47:36,233 --> 00:47:41,068
Nobody tries to hurt nobody,
just who ends up on their butt?

668
00:47:44,867 --> 00:47:47,334
That's a great idea, Kato.

669
00:47:58,968 --> 00:48:00,968
You know, Bruce,
that guy's kind of famous.

670
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,601
That guy?

671
00:48:02,734 --> 00:48:04,100
For what?

672
00:48:04,233 --> 00:48:06,601
Killed his wife
and got away with it.

673
00:48:06,734 --> 00:48:07,867
That guy?

674
00:48:08,001 --> 00:48:09,534
That guy.

675
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,434
Not bad, Kato.

676
00:48:36,767 --> 00:48:38,567
Try that again.

677
00:49:19,601 --> 00:49:21,934
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

678
00:49:22,068 --> 00:49:23,801
What the fuck
is going on here?

679
00:49:23,934 --> 00:49:27,034
Hey, jackass,
this is our series lead.

680
00:49:27,167 --> 00:49:28,734
What the fuck
are you thinking?

681
00:49:28,867 --> 00:49:31,068
You're right, Janet.
I'm sorry about that.

682
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,767
Don't fucking "Janet" me,
you prick.

683
00:49:33,901 --> 00:49:36,100
Hey.
What's up, babe?

684
00:49:36,233 --> 00:49:39,567
What's up, Randy,
is that your loser asshole,

685
00:49:39,701 --> 00:49:42,901
wife-killing buddy boy here was
beating the shit out of Bruce.

686
00:49:43,034 --> 00:49:44,434
What?

687
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:46,567
- Hey, Randy.
- Cliff.

688
00:49:46,701 --> 00:49:48,434
What the fuck, man?

689
00:49:48,567 --> 00:49:52,001
Let me just say, nobody beat
the shit out of Bruce.

690
00:49:52,133 --> 00:49:54,400
It was a friendly contest.
He barely touched me.

691
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:57,100
I think that dent in the car
says something different.

692
00:49:58,767 --> 00:50:00,968
Oh, my God!

693
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,500
What the fuck
did you do to my car?!

694
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:05,767
What the fuck
did you do to her car?

695
00:50:05,901 --> 00:50:07,867
I threw this
little prick into it,

696
00:50:08,001 --> 00:50:09,934
but I did not know
it was her car.

697
00:50:10,068 --> 00:50:14,534
Get the wardrobe off,
get your shit, and get fucked!

698
00:50:14,667 --> 00:50:15,601
- Janet!
- What?

699
00:50:15,734 --> 00:50:16,801
I will handle this.

700
00:50:16,934 --> 00:50:18,534
Then fucking handle it,
Randy.

701
00:50:20,034 --> 00:50:20,934
Cliff...

702
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,300
get the wardrobe off,
get your shit,

703
00:50:25,434 --> 00:50:27,133
and get off the lot.

704
00:50:30,167 --> 00:50:31,567
Fair enough.

705
00:51:05,801 --> 00:51:08,233
Aw. What's the matter?

706
00:51:08,367 --> 00:51:12,200
Are you afraid I'll tell
Jim Morrison you were dancing

707
00:51:12,334 --> 00:51:14,634
to Paul Revere
and the Raiders?

708
00:51:14,767 --> 00:51:16,634
Are they not
cool enough for you?

709
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:28,734
Who's this
shaggy asshole?

710
00:51:30,467 --> 00:51:31,767
Hello? Can I help you?

711
00:51:31,901 --> 00:51:34,601
Oh, yeah. Hey, man.
I'm looking for Terry.

712
00:51:34,734 --> 00:51:37,767
I'm a friend of Terry's
and Dennis Wilson's.

713
00:51:37,901 --> 00:51:40,034
Well, Terry and Candy
don't live here anymore.

714
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:41,767
This is the Polanski
residence now.

715
00:51:41,901 --> 00:51:44,233
Really? He moved?

716
00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:45,767
Dang.

717
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,934
Uh, you know...?
You know where?

718
00:51:49,068 --> 00:51:51,334
I'm not sure,
but the owner of the property,

719
00:51:51,467 --> 00:51:54,334
Paul, might.
He's in the guest house.

720
00:51:54,467 --> 00:51:55,934
Who is it, Jay?

721
00:51:56,068 --> 00:51:59,500
It's okay, honey.
It's a friend of Terry's.

722
00:51:59,634 --> 00:52:01,734
Yeah, just take
the back path.

723
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:03,001
Thank you kindly.

724
00:52:05,133 --> 00:52:06,467
Ma'am.

725
00:52:22,334 --> 00:52:24,601
- All right, that's an hour!
- Hey, Rick.

726
00:52:24,734 --> 00:52:26,300
I know they just
broke for lunch,

727
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:29,133
but you need to wait at least
an hour before you can eat.

728
00:52:29,267 --> 00:52:31,934
- Give that glue a chance to dry.
- Oh, no worries, honey.

729
00:52:32,068 --> 00:52:36,400
I got my book. Say, say,
where's the bad-guy saloon?

730
00:52:36,534 --> 00:52:38,601
You just go straight
through the Western town,

731
00:52:38,734 --> 00:52:41,200
take a right and a left,
and you see it right there.

732
00:52:41,334 --> 00:52:43,934
Thanks, honey.

733
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,300
Can we move to number two?

734
00:52:47,434 --> 00:52:48,901
How is his bounce?

735
00:52:49,034 --> 00:52:50,634
Can I get a bounce there?

736
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:53,267
Just grab the crescent
wrench, come right back.

737
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,601
Just make it a quick one.

738
00:52:55,934 --> 00:52:58,467
- Tim!
- Looks great. Right there.

739
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,434
Hello.

740
00:53:47,767 --> 00:53:48,667
Hello.

741
00:53:51,434 --> 00:53:52,767
Hello.

742
00:53:54,934 --> 00:53:56,133
Would...

743
00:53:56,267 --> 00:53:57,968
Would it bother you
if I sat

744
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,100
next to you
and read my book too?

745
00:54:02,434 --> 00:54:03,968
I don't know.

746
00:54:04,901 --> 00:54:06,968
Would you bother me?

747
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,567
I'll try not to.

748
00:54:11,968 --> 00:54:13,100
Sit.

749
00:54:58,068 --> 00:54:59,068
Ah.

750
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:04,133
Sorry. Sorry about that.
Ahem.

751
00:55:09,467 --> 00:55:10,734
You don't eat lunch?

752
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,267
I've got a scene
after lunch.

753
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,400
Yeah?

754
00:55:17,034 --> 00:55:20,300
Eating lunch before I do
a scene makes me sluggish.

755
00:55:20,434 --> 00:55:22,233
I believe it's the job
of an actor...

756
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,467
And I say "actor,"
not "actress,"

757
00:55:24,601 --> 00:55:27,400
because the word "actress"
is nonsensical.

758
00:55:27,534 --> 00:55:29,767
It's the actor's job
to avoid

759
00:55:29,901 --> 00:55:31,934
impediments
to their performance.

760
00:55:32,068 --> 00:55:36,634
It's the actor's job to strive
for 100 percent effectiveness.

761
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:40,867
Naturally, we never succeed,
but it's the pursuit...

762
00:55:41,667 --> 00:55:43,100
that's meaningful.

763
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,200
- Who are you?
- You can call me Marabella.

764
00:55:47,334 --> 00:55:50,233
Mar... Marabella what?

765
00:55:50,367 --> 00:55:51,834
Marabella Lancer.

766
00:55:51,968 --> 00:55:55,233
No, no, come on, come on.
What's your real name?

767
00:55:57,367 --> 00:55:59,334
When we're on set,
I'd prefer to only

768
00:55:59,467 --> 00:56:01,400
be referred to
by my character's name.

769
00:56:01,534 --> 00:56:04,634
It helps me invest
in the reality of the story.

770
00:56:04,767 --> 00:56:06,934
I've tried it both ways,
and I'm always just

771
00:56:07,068 --> 00:56:09,267
a tiny bit better
when I don't break character.

772
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,934
And if I can be
a tiny bit better, I want to be.

773
00:56:16,133 --> 00:56:19,100
You're the bad guy.
Caleb DeCoteau.

774
00:56:22,767 --> 00:56:26,068
I thought it was
pronounced Caleb "Dakota."

775
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,300
I'm pretty sure
it's "DeCoteau."

776
00:56:31,601 --> 00:56:33,400
- DeCoteau.
- Mm.

777
00:56:34,867 --> 00:56:37,701
DeCoteau. DeCoteau.

778
00:56:38,934 --> 00:56:40,267
Hmm.

779
00:56:55,601 --> 00:56:56,934
What are you reading?

780
00:56:58,267 --> 00:57:00,734
It's a biography
on Walt Disney.

781
00:57:00,867 --> 00:57:02,434
It's fascinating.

782
00:57:02,567 --> 00:57:04,400
He's a genius, you know.

783
00:57:04,534 --> 00:57:07,901
I mean, a once-in-every-50
-or-100-years kind of genius.

784
00:57:08,034 --> 00:57:10,100
What are you, 12?

785
00:57:10,968 --> 00:57:12,133
I'm 8.

786
00:57:13,034 --> 00:57:14,801
What are you reading?

787
00:57:16,367 --> 00:57:17,601
Just a Western.

788
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:20,667
What does that mean?
Is it good?

789
00:57:20,801 --> 00:57:23,767
- Pretty good.
- What's the story?

790
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,901
I haven't finished
it yet.

791
00:57:27,034 --> 00:57:30,133
I didn't ask
for the whole story.

792
00:57:30,267 --> 00:57:31,968
What's the idea
of the story?

793
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,867
Well... ahem,

794
00:57:35,001 --> 00:57:38,068
it's about this guy
who's a bronco buster.

795
00:57:39,267 --> 00:57:41,233
It's the story
of his life.

796
00:57:42,567 --> 00:57:44,367
Guy's name
is Tom Breezy,

797
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,534
but everyone always
calls him Easy Breezy.

798
00:57:47,667 --> 00:57:50,233
Now, when Easy Breezy
was in his 20s

799
00:57:50,367 --> 00:57:53,367
and-and-and young and
good-looking, he could...

800
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,734
He could break any horse
that you could throw at him.

801
00:57:56,867 --> 00:57:59,767
Back then,
he just had a way.

802
00:57:59,901 --> 00:58:03,167
Now he's into
his, uh, late 30s

803
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,901
and he takes a bad fall,
and it messes up his hip.

804
00:58:06,034 --> 00:58:08,434
He's not... He's not...
He's not crippled

805
00:58:08,567 --> 00:58:10,901
or anything like that, but...

806
00:58:11,034 --> 00:58:13,001
But he's got
spine problems

807
00:58:13,133 --> 00:58:15,801
he never had before,
and he spends, uh...

808
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:20,968
more of his days in pain
than he ever did before.

809
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:24,001
Jeepers, this sounds
like a good novel.

810
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:26,767
Yeah, it's not bad.

811
00:58:27,767 --> 00:58:29,467
Where are you in it?

812
00:58:29,601 --> 00:58:31,801
Mm. About midway.

813
00:58:33,167 --> 00:58:36,367
What's happening
to Easy Breezy now?

814
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,968
Uh, he's, um...
He...

815
00:58:40,367 --> 00:58:42,133
He's not the best
anymore.

816
00:58:43,434 --> 00:58:45,267
In fact,
far from it. And...

817
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:51,100
he's coming to terms with what
it's like to be slightly more...

818
00:58:53,901 --> 00:58:55,434
use...

819
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,467
Slightly more useless
each day.

820
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,801
I-it's okay, Caleb.

821
00:59:24,934 --> 00:59:26,467
It's okay.

822
00:59:26,601 --> 00:59:29,034
It sounds like
a really sad book.

823
00:59:29,167 --> 00:59:31,068
Poor Easy Breezy.

824
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,634
I'm practically crying,
and I haven't even read it.

825
00:59:35,701 --> 00:59:37,601
About 15 years,
you'll be living it.

826
00:59:37,734 --> 00:59:39,034
What?

827
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,133
Nothing, pumpkin puss.
I'm just...

828
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,634
I'm just teasing you.

829
00:59:49,001 --> 00:59:50,801
You know something? You...

830
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,968
You might be right
about this book.

831
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,300
I think it hits harder
than I gave it credit for.

832
01:00:00,133 --> 01:00:03,434
I don't like names
like "pumpkin puss,"

833
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,400
but since you're upset,

834
01:00:06,534 --> 01:00:08,467
we'll talk about that
some other time.

835
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:05,434
I'm only going as far
as Westwood Village.

836
01:01:05,567 --> 01:01:07,233
Hey, beggars
can't be choosers.

837
01:01:07,367 --> 01:01:08,267
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

838
01:01:28,867 --> 01:01:30,500
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

839
01:01:31,901 --> 01:01:33,701
- Good luck on your adventure.
- Thank you.

840
01:01:33,834 --> 01:01:36,200
- Have a good time in Big Sur.
- Thank you so much.

841
01:01:36,334 --> 01:01:37,534
- Take care.
- You too.

842
01:02:43,867 --> 01:02:46,400
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.

843
01:02:46,534 --> 01:02:49,100
How can I help you,
young lady?

844
01:02:49,233 --> 01:02:51,467
Oh.

845
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,300
I'm here to pick up
a first edition

846
01:02:53,434 --> 01:02:55,968
of Thomas Hardy's <i>Tess</i>
<i>of the d'Urbervilles</i> I ordered.

847
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:57,267
It's under Polanski.

848
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,133
Yeah, you're talking books
there, kid.

849
01:02:59,267 --> 01:03:00,634
Oh, I know.
Isn't it wonderful?

850
01:03:00,767 --> 01:03:02,634
- Yeah. Oh, man.
- I just read it.

851
01:03:02,767 --> 01:03:05,100
- I'm getting it as a gift for my husband.
- Mm.

852
01:03:07,901 --> 01:03:10,434
- Rick Dalton?
- You bet.

853
01:03:10,567 --> 01:03:13,068
Jim Stacy. This is my show.
Welcome aboard.

854
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,934
We're real glad
to have a pro like you

855
01:03:15,068 --> 01:03:16,467
playing the heavy
on the pilot.

856
01:03:16,601 --> 01:03:18,968
And I gotta tell you,
I came damn close

857
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:21,767
to being in <i>The Fourteen</i>
<i>Fists of McCluskey.</i>

858
01:03:21,901 --> 01:03:23,068
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

859
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,767
Let me tell you, I...

860
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:27,100
I just got my part-part
by sheer luck.

861
01:03:27,233 --> 01:03:28,901
Up until two weeks
before shooting,

862
01:03:29,034 --> 01:03:30,667
Fabian was in the part.

863
01:03:30,801 --> 01:03:33,400
Then-then he breaks his shoulder
doing a <i>Virginian.</i>

864
01:03:33,534 --> 01:03:34,734
That's how I got it, so...

865
01:03:34,867 --> 01:03:35,767
Ah.

866
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:41,100
Hey, Rick, I gotta ask you
something I heard about.

867
01:03:41,233 --> 01:03:42,434
Was it true
you almost got

868
01:03:42,567 --> 01:03:44,300
the McQueen part
in <i>The Great Escape?</i>

869
01:03:45,934 --> 01:03:48,934
- Hilts, isn't it?
- Captain Hilts, actually.

870
01:03:49,068 --> 01:03:50,867
- Seventeen escape attempts.
- Eighteen.

871
01:03:51,001 --> 01:03:53,601
Never had an audition.
Never had a meeting.

872
01:03:53,734 --> 01:03:55,034
Never met John Sturges.

873
01:03:55,167 --> 01:03:57,701
So, no, I don't think
you could say I...

874
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,801
I almost got the part, but...

875
01:03:59,934 --> 01:04:02,233
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.

876
01:04:02,367 --> 01:04:04,634
I suppose what's called in
the American Army,

877
01:04:04,767 --> 01:04:06,634
a hotshot pilot.

878
01:04:06,767 --> 01:04:10,834
But the story goes,
for a brief moment,

879
01:04:10,968 --> 01:04:13,767
McQueen almost passed
on the movie,

880
01:04:13,901 --> 01:04:15,400
and during that
brief moment,

881
01:04:15,534 --> 01:04:17,734
I, apparently,
was on a list of four.

882
01:04:17,867 --> 01:04:18,968
You have other plans?

883
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,300
I haven't seen Berlin yet

884
01:04:20,434 --> 01:04:21,901
from the ground
or from the air,

885
01:04:22,034 --> 01:04:24,233
and I plan on doing both
before the war's over.

886
01:04:24,367 --> 01:04:25,767
You and who?

887
01:04:25,901 --> 01:04:29,068
- Me and... Me and three Georges.
- Which three Georges?

888
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,667
Peppard, Maharis and Chakiris.

889
01:04:30,801 --> 01:04:32,300
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

890
01:04:32,434 --> 01:04:33,667
That's gotta hurt.

891
01:04:33,801 --> 01:04:35,834
Yeah, well,
I didn't get it,

892
01:04:35,968 --> 01:04:37,267
McQueen did it,

893
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,767
and, frankly,
I never had a chance.

894
01:04:41,334 --> 01:04:44,034
Ten days isolation,
Hilts.

895
01:04:44,167 --> 01:04:45,233
Captain Hilts.

896
01:04:45,367 --> 01:04:47,133
Twenty days.

897
01:04:47,267 --> 01:04:48,200
Right.

898
01:04:49,534 --> 01:04:52,367
Oh, you'll still be here
when I get out?

899
01:04:53,734 --> 01:04:55,367
Cooler.

900
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:53,233
- One, please.
- Seventy-five cents.

901
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:58,567
What if I'm in the movie?

902
01:05:58,701 --> 01:06:00,267
What do you mean?

903
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,968
I mean, I'm in the movie.

904
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:04,567
I'm Sharon Tate.

905
01:06:04,701 --> 01:06:07,133
- You're in this?
- Mm-hm.

906
01:06:07,267 --> 01:06:09,400
I play Miss Carlson, the klutz.

907
01:06:10,834 --> 01:06:11,867
That's me.

908
01:06:13,634 --> 01:06:16,300
But that's the girl
from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

909
01:06:17,934 --> 01:06:21,968
Well, that's me, the girl
from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

910
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,734
Really?

911
01:06:23,867 --> 01:06:25,133
Really.

912
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:29,968
Hey, Rubin!
Come out here.

913
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,934
This is the girl
from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

914
01:06:36,068 --> 01:06:38,100
- Patty Duke?
- No, the other one.

915
01:06:38,233 --> 01:06:40,400
- The girl from <i>Peyton Place?</i>
- No, the other one.

916
01:06:40,534 --> 01:06:42,834
The one who ends up
doing dirty movies.

917
01:06:42,968 --> 01:06:45,867
- Oh.
- She's in this movie.

918
01:06:46,001 --> 01:06:47,567
- Oh.
- Sharon Tate.

919
01:06:47,701 --> 01:06:51,068
Well, welcome
to the Bruin, Miss Tate.

920
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,801
Thank you for coming
to our theater.

921
01:06:52,934 --> 01:06:54,934
Would you like to come in
and see the show?

922
01:06:55,068 --> 01:06:55,934
Could I?

923
01:06:56,068 --> 01:06:57,267
By all means.

924
01:06:58,267 --> 01:06:59,200
Thank you.

925
01:07:01,167 --> 01:07:03,068
Hey, can I get
a picture?

926
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,133
Oh, sure.

927
01:07:04,267 --> 01:07:05,133
Okay.

928
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,734
You know, why don't you
stand over by the poster

929
01:07:11,867 --> 01:07:13,801
so people will know
who you are.

930
01:07:13,934 --> 01:07:16,167
Okay. Could you?

931
01:07:28,867 --> 01:07:30,334
Would you like
some refreshments?

932
01:07:30,467 --> 01:07:33,100
- Oh, I'm fine. Thank you.
- Enjoy the show.

933
01:08:09,267 --> 01:08:11,634
<i>Can I ask
you a personal question?</i>

934
01:08:11,767 --> 01:08:13,968
- <i>I wish you would.</i>
- <i>How did a nice boy</i>

935
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:16,934
<i>like you get involved
with a group like the Heads?</i>

936
01:08:17,068 --> 01:08:18,934
<i>I turned to them
after I was rejected</i>

937
01:08:19,068 --> 01:08:21,133
<i>by the Daughters
of the American Revolution.</i>

938
01:08:43,567 --> 01:08:45,334
<i>Very pleasant hotel here.</i>

939
01:08:46,567 --> 01:08:48,100
- <i>Mr. Helm?</i>
- <i>Yes?</i>

940
01:08:48,233 --> 01:08:49,300
<i>Oh!</i>

941
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,634
<i>I'm Freya.</i>

942
01:08:54,767 --> 01:08:57,100
<i>Welcome to Denmark,
Mr. Helm.</i>

943
01:08:57,233 --> 01:09:00,934
<i>These are for you. Street maps,
places of interest.</i>

944
01:09:01,068 --> 01:09:02,400
<i>This is for you too.</i>

945
01:09:04,167 --> 01:09:05,901
- <i>What year was that?</i>
- <i>1949.</i>

946
01:09:06,034 --> 01:09:07,701
<i>That's a very good year.</i>

947
01:09:07,834 --> 01:09:09,534
<i>I'm here to
help any way I can.</i>

948
01:09:09,667 --> 01:09:10,534
<i>Very nice of you.</i>

949
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:11,534
<i>Is there anything</i>

950
01:09:11,667 --> 01:09:12,934
<i>you'd like me to do?</i>

951
01:09:13,068 --> 01:09:15,034
- <i>Yes, a couple things.</i>
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

952
01:09:15,167 --> 01:09:18,467
<i>Would you mind getting off
my camera case, please?</i>

953
01:09:18,601 --> 01:09:20,233
- <i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>
- <i>Oh, that's all right.</i>

954
01:09:20,367 --> 01:09:22,400
- <i>I'm so sorry.</i>
- <i>That's okay.</i>

955
01:09:22,534 --> 01:09:23,500
<i>I'm sorry about...</i>

956
01:09:24,968 --> 01:09:26,567
<i>Welcome to Denmark.</i>

957
01:09:35,133 --> 01:09:38,133
<i>This is some kind of hotel
you've got here.</i>

958
01:09:40,434 --> 01:09:42,500
<i>Half a bottle
is better than none.</i>

959
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:53,968
Morning, partner.

960
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:56,467
Probably come
by to see you later.

961
01:10:30,233 --> 01:10:32,300
That's far enough,
jughead.

962
01:10:33,133 --> 01:10:34,634
Name's not jughead.

963
01:10:35,968 --> 01:10:38,167
What you doing
around here, boy?

964
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:41,233
I'm thirsty. That's a saloon,
ain't it?

965
01:10:41,367 --> 01:10:44,434
Oh, yeah,
that's a saloon.

966
01:10:44,567 --> 01:10:47,100
- Only you can't come in.
- Mr. Gilbert.

967
01:10:49,034 --> 01:10:52,434
Don't let me stop you
from earning your money.

968
01:10:54,601 --> 01:10:56,634
I know how bored
and restless you get

969
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,734
when you run out of tamales.

970
01:11:00,534 --> 01:11:02,734
But, Mr. Gilbert,
if I was you,

971
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,701
I'd find out that
jughead's name.

972
01:11:08,167 --> 01:11:10,801
Allow me to introduce
the two of you.

973
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:14,434
This here is Bob Gilbert.

974
01:11:15,601 --> 01:11:17,300
The Businessman?

975
01:11:17,434 --> 01:11:19,200
That's right.

976
01:11:19,334 --> 01:11:23,667
Business Bob Gilbert.
And who might he be, Caleb?

977
01:11:23,801 --> 01:11:27,001
Well,
that's a fella by the name of Madrid.

978
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:29,267
Johnny Madrid.

979
01:11:30,267 --> 01:11:32,167
Who's Johnny Madrid?

980
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,068
He ain't from round here.

981
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,233
No, really.

982
01:11:42,367 --> 01:11:43,434
Who is he, Caleb?

983
01:11:48,233 --> 01:11:49,968
Oh, you're about
to find out...

984
01:11:51,767 --> 01:11:52,801
Businessman.

985
01:12:10,567 --> 01:12:13,467
Ready when you are,
Gilbert.

986
01:12:55,567 --> 01:12:57,634
Johnny Madrid.

987
01:13:02,534 --> 01:13:04,300
How long has it been?

988
01:13:04,434 --> 01:13:07,901
Since that time in
Juárez, about three years ago.

989
01:13:08,034 --> 01:13:11,400
Well, come on in
and have a drink.

990
01:13:11,534 --> 01:13:13,867
Hell, in that case...

991
01:13:16,001 --> 01:13:18,267
buy you a drink, Caleb?

992
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,467
Sure, Johnny.

993
01:13:20,901 --> 01:13:23,467
How about some mezcal?

994
01:13:23,601 --> 01:13:25,434
Like that time in Juárez.

995
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:29,467
A lot of people
died that day.

996
01:13:29,601 --> 01:13:31,068
Yes, they did.

997
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:35,001
But we had a good time.

998
01:13:35,133 --> 01:13:36,233
Didn't we?

999
01:13:36,367 --> 01:13:38,334
Yeah, we did.

1000
01:13:39,467 --> 01:13:41,068
After you, DeCoteau.

1001
01:13:42,534 --> 01:13:45,500
Pepe! Get your behind
behind that bar.

1002
01:13:45,634 --> 01:13:47,334
I have a guest.

1003
01:14:03,434 --> 01:14:04,767
How's the beans?

1004
01:14:06,367 --> 01:14:07,734
I've had worse.

1005
01:14:10,001 --> 01:14:12,068
One dollar.

1006
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:19,034
To my wife
and all my sweethearts.

1007
01:14:19,167 --> 01:14:21,233
May they never meet.

1008
01:14:27,701 --> 01:14:31,267
Señor Madrid, you care
to join me at my table

1009
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,834
where I entertain
my guests?

1010
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:35,500
I'd be
delighted, Monsieur DeCoteau.

1011
01:14:37,233 --> 01:14:39,167
Take the bottle
with you.

1012
01:14:40,867 --> 01:14:42,801
So, Johnny, ahem...

1013
01:14:44,701 --> 01:14:46,434
what brings you
to Arroyo del Oro?

1014
01:14:46,567 --> 01:14:49,467
Oh, you know me,
Caleb.

1015
01:14:49,601 --> 01:14:51,068
Money.

1016
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,500
And who's paying
around here?

1017
01:14:54,634 --> 01:14:56,100
I hope you.

1018
01:14:56,233 --> 01:14:58,001
Huh.

1019
01:14:58,133 --> 01:15:00,500
And what have you
heard about me?

1020
01:15:00,634 --> 01:15:02,467
I heard about
the Lancer Ranch.

1021
01:15:02,601 --> 01:15:04,767
All the cattle
you've appropriated.

1022
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:06,267
A lot of land,
a lot of cows,

1023
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,233
a lot of money,
no law to speak of,

1024
01:15:08,367 --> 01:15:09,767
and nothing
but an old man

1025
01:15:09,901 --> 01:15:12,801
and some Mexican ranch hands
to shoo you off.

1026
01:15:15,034 --> 01:15:17,233
Say, where's that
chili pepper

1027
01:15:17,367 --> 01:15:19,634
daughter of yours
with the fiddle?

1028
01:15:19,767 --> 01:15:21,534
She's asleep.

1029
01:15:21,667 --> 01:15:23,734
Wake her the heck up,
get her down here

1030
01:15:23,867 --> 01:15:27,367
with her fiddle and her bow,
and entertain my guest.

1031
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,400
But, please, don't hurt her
this time.

1032
01:15:34,034 --> 01:15:35,500
I ain't gonna hurt her.

1033
01:15:35,634 --> 01:15:39,334
I just want her
to play the fiddle.

1034
01:15:42,801 --> 01:15:45,634
Line? "Go... Go fetch her
and tell her" what?

1035
01:15:45,767 --> 01:15:47,267
"Go fetch her and tell her

1036
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,267
I'll give her a fat
$5 gold piece..."

1037
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:50,834
Right. Go fetch her
and tell her

1038
01:15:50,968 --> 01:15:52,801
I'll give her
a fat-fat $5 gold piece,

1039
01:15:52,934 --> 01:15:55,267
she play her little
chili pepper heart out, right?

1040
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,734
- Right.
- Got it.

1041
01:16:02,934 --> 01:16:04,767
I ain't gonna hurt her.

1042
01:16:04,901 --> 01:16:07,133
I just want her
to play the fiddle.

1043
01:16:07,267 --> 01:16:08,601
Now, go fetch her
and tell her

1044
01:16:08,734 --> 01:16:10,267
I'll give her
a fat $5 gold piece,

1045
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,434
she play her little
chili pepper heart out.

1046
01:16:13,567 --> 01:16:15,267
Go on.

1047
01:16:19,601 --> 01:16:21,267
So, Johnny,

1048
01:16:22,534 --> 01:16:24,133
what else you heard?

1049
01:16:24,267 --> 01:16:25,734
Hmm.

1050
01:16:25,867 --> 01:16:28,400
I heard you're pushing
Lancer pretty hard,

1051
01:16:28,534 --> 01:16:31,233
but Lancer's got money.

1052
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,434
At some point,

1053
01:16:34,567 --> 01:16:36,834
he's gonna hire some guns

1054
01:16:36,968 --> 01:16:39,001
and push back.

1055
01:16:46,068 --> 01:16:49,068
- Line. Line. Line, line, line.
- "Maybe he already has."

1056
01:16:52,068 --> 01:16:53,400
Maybe... Goddamn it!

1057
01:16:53,534 --> 01:16:55,068
I fucked this
whole thing up, Sam.

1058
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,400
Keep going!

1059
01:16:56,534 --> 01:16:57,801
- I fucked this up.
- Fight through it.

1060
01:16:57,934 --> 01:17:00,001
Can we just go back?
Please, can we just cut?

1061
01:17:00,133 --> 01:17:01,467
Just say the fucking line!

1062
01:17:01,601 --> 01:17:03,034
No, really, Sam, please.

1063
01:17:03,167 --> 01:17:04,667
- "Maybe he already has."
- All right!

1064
01:17:04,801 --> 01:17:07,133
- "Maybe he already has!"
- All right, goddamn it!

1065
01:17:07,267 --> 01:17:08,233
All right, all right!

1066
01:17:08,367 --> 01:17:09,634
Woo!

1067
01:17:09,767 --> 01:17:11,801
You're a goddamn outlaw,
Rick. Come on, now.

1068
01:17:11,934 --> 01:17:13,434
Woo!

1069
01:17:13,567 --> 01:17:15,300
I got it. I got it.

1070
01:17:16,667 --> 01:17:18,034
Go back a bit, would you?

1071
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:20,434
No, he's right. Back to one.

1072
01:17:20,567 --> 01:17:22,934
- Okay, now, use all that, baby.
- I'm gonna use it.

1073
01:17:23,068 --> 01:17:25,400
- Oh, I'm gonna use it.
- Put it all inside.

1074
01:17:25,534 --> 01:17:26,467
I'm gonna use it.

1075
01:17:28,567 --> 01:17:29,467
And...

1076
01:17:30,567 --> 01:17:31,934
action.

1077
01:17:34,834 --> 01:17:37,133
I heard you're pushing
Lancer pretty hard,

1078
01:17:37,267 --> 01:17:39,767
but Lancer's got money.

1079
01:17:40,934 --> 01:17:42,834
At some point,

1080
01:17:42,968 --> 01:17:47,233
he's gonna hire
some guns and push back.

1081
01:17:50,734 --> 01:17:53,467
Maybe he already has.

1082
01:17:53,601 --> 01:17:56,100
Maybe.

1083
01:17:58,934 --> 01:18:00,467
Maybe
I don't like Lancer.

1084
01:18:01,968 --> 01:18:03,767
Maybe I don't like
his boots.

1085
01:18:05,434 --> 01:18:07,100
Maybe I don't like the way

1086
01:18:07,233 --> 01:18:10,300
he uses those boots
to step on people.

1087
01:18:13,934 --> 01:18:15,500
What the fuck was that?!

1088
01:18:15,634 --> 01:18:18,068
Jesus Christ!

1089
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,400
Fuck!

1090
01:18:19,534 --> 01:18:21,734
Piece of shit.

1091
01:18:21,867 --> 01:18:23,834
Fucking damn it, Rick,
I swear to God.

1092
01:18:23,968 --> 01:18:26,167
Forgot your fucking lines,
embarrassed yourself

1093
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:28,500
like that in front of all
those goddamn people!

1094
01:18:28,634 --> 01:18:31,601
You were drinking all night,
fucking drinking again,

1095
01:18:31,734 --> 01:18:34,601
eight goddamn fucking
whiskey sours.

1096
01:18:34,734 --> 01:18:37,801
Fucking bullshit.

1097
01:18:39,834 --> 01:18:42,100
You're a fucking
miserable drunk.

1098
01:18:42,233 --> 01:18:44,534
Not fucking remembering
your fucking lines.

1099
01:18:44,667 --> 01:18:46,601
I practiced them,
and now I don't look

1100
01:18:46,734 --> 01:18:48,367
like I goddamn practiced them!

1101
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,634
You're sitting there
like a fucking baboon!

1102
01:18:52,734 --> 01:18:54,434
Fuck! Eight fucking
whiskey sours.

1103
01:18:54,567 --> 01:18:57,534
I couldn't stop at fucking
three or four. I have eight!

1104
01:18:57,667 --> 01:18:59,400
Why?! You're
a fucking alcoholic.

1105
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:01,233
You fucking drink
too much, huh?

1106
01:19:01,367 --> 01:19:03,734
Every fucking night.
Every fucking night.

1107
01:19:03,867 --> 01:19:05,467
That's it,
that's fucking it!

1108
01:19:05,601 --> 01:19:06,867
That's fucking it.

1109
01:19:07,001 --> 01:19:09,233
You stop drinking right now,
all right?

1110
01:19:09,367 --> 01:19:10,634
Make a promise to yourself.

1111
01:19:10,767 --> 01:19:12,867
You're gonna stop
fucking drinking.

1112
01:19:13,001 --> 01:19:14,034
Oh, fuck it.

1113
01:19:17,734 --> 01:19:19,534
Damn it!

1114
01:19:19,667 --> 01:19:21,367
You show that
little fucking girl.

1115
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,434
You're gonna show
that goddamn Jim Stacy.

1116
01:19:23,567 --> 01:19:25,968
You're gonna show them
on that goddamn fucking set

1117
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,901
who the fuck
Rick Dalton is, all right?

1118
01:20:04,109 --> 01:20:06,208
Let me tell you something.

1119
01:20:06,342 --> 01:20:08,942
You don't get
these lines right,

1120
01:20:09,076 --> 01:20:11,976
I'm gonna blow
your fucking brains out tonight.

1121
01:20:12,109 --> 01:20:13,976
All right?
Your brains are gonna

1122
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:16,442
be splattered
all over your goddamn pool.

1123
01:20:16,575 --> 01:20:18,509
I mean it, motherfucker.

1124
01:20:18,642 --> 01:20:19,909
Get your shit together.

1125
01:21:26,076 --> 01:21:27,809
- Better? Okay.
- It's great.

1126
01:22:53,709 --> 01:22:54,709
Hey!

1127
01:22:55,776 --> 01:22:56,676
Hi.

1128
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:01,876
Huh.

1129
01:23:02,009 --> 01:23:04,009
Woo!

1130
01:23:04,143 --> 01:23:05,342
Shit.

1131
01:23:12,109 --> 01:23:14,542
Fuck you, you fucking pig!

1132
01:23:14,676 --> 01:23:16,475
Oh, no.

1133
01:23:31,842 --> 01:23:33,009
Hello, hot stuff.

1134
01:23:33,143 --> 01:23:35,475
Looks like third time's
the charm.

1135
01:23:35,609 --> 01:23:37,475
Mm. How were those pickles?

1136
01:23:40,776 --> 01:23:42,609
Real good.

1137
01:23:42,742 --> 01:23:44,043
They were
the fancy kind.

1138
01:23:44,175 --> 01:23:45,676
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1139
01:23:47,076 --> 01:23:48,308
Give me a lift?

1140
01:23:48,442 --> 01:23:49,676
Where are you going?

1141
01:23:51,143 --> 01:23:53,308
I'm going to Chatsworth.

1142
01:23:53,442 --> 01:23:55,375
Chatsworth?

1143
01:23:55,509 --> 01:23:58,208
You hitch up and down
Burbank Boulevard all day

1144
01:23:58,342 --> 01:24:00,876
till someone says they'll
drive you to Chatsworth?

1145
01:24:01,009 --> 01:24:02,642
Tourists love to drive me.

1146
01:24:02,776 --> 01:24:04,976
I'm their favorite part
of their L.A. vacation.

1147
01:24:05,109 --> 01:24:08,542
They'll be telling stories
about the Hollywood hippie girl

1148
01:24:08,676 --> 01:24:10,609
that they gave a ride
to the movie ranch

1149
01:24:10,742 --> 01:24:12,342
for the rest of their lives.

1150
01:24:12,475 --> 01:24:13,876
Wait, Spahn Movie Ranch?

1151
01:24:15,242 --> 01:24:16,709
- Yeah.
- That's where you're going?

1152
01:24:16,842 --> 01:24:17,776
Spahn Movie Ranch?

1153
01:24:17,909 --> 01:24:18,942
Uh-huh.

1154
01:24:19,076 --> 01:24:20,275
Why you going there?

1155
01:24:21,076 --> 01:24:21,976
I live there.

1156
01:24:22,842 --> 01:24:25,342
- Alone?
- No.

1157
01:24:25,475 --> 01:24:26,776
Me and my friends.

1158
01:24:28,208 --> 01:24:30,509
So you and a bunch
of friends like you

1159
01:24:30,642 --> 01:24:32,475
all live
at Spahn Movie Ranch?

1160
01:24:33,942 --> 01:24:34,842
Yeah.

1161
01:24:37,175 --> 01:24:38,742
Well, hop in.
I'll take you there.

1162
01:24:39,676 --> 01:24:40,876
Great!

1163
01:24:50,342 --> 01:24:52,509
Go down here and get on
the Hollywood Freeway.

1164
01:24:52,642 --> 01:24:54,076
I know where it is.

1165
01:24:56,109 --> 01:24:59,375
Are you some old cowboy guy
that used to make movies there?

1166
01:24:59,509 --> 01:25:01,009
Whoa!

1167
01:25:01,143 --> 01:25:02,642
What?

1168
01:25:02,776 --> 01:25:04,143
I'm just surprised
how accurate

1169
01:25:04,275 --> 01:25:06,009
that description
of me really is.

1170
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:09,475
Some old cowboy guy that used
to shoot movies at Spahn Ranch.

1171
01:25:09,609 --> 01:25:13,076
So you used to make Westerns
at the ranch

1172
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:15,575
back in the old-timey days?

1173
01:25:17,342 --> 01:25:19,909
Well, if by
"the old-timey days,"

1174
01:25:20,043 --> 01:25:23,342
you mean television
eight years ago, yeah.

1175
01:25:23,475 --> 01:25:24,809
Are you an actor?

1176
01:25:24,942 --> 01:25:26,542
No, I'm a stuntman.

1177
01:25:27,809 --> 01:25:29,475
You're a stuntman.

1178
01:25:30,642 --> 01:25:32,776
That's way better.

1179
01:25:32,909 --> 01:25:34,208
Why is that way better?

1180
01:25:35,409 --> 01:25:37,642
- Actors are phony.
- Oh.

1181
01:25:37,776 --> 01:25:39,842
They just say lines
that other people write

1182
01:25:39,976 --> 01:25:43,642
and pretend to murder people
on their stupid TV shows.

1183
01:25:43,776 --> 01:25:46,842
Meanwhile, real people are being
murdered every day in Vietnam.

1184
01:26:09,509 --> 01:26:11,375
Want me to suck your cock
while driving?

1185
01:26:20,275 --> 01:26:21,275
How old are you?

1186
01:26:22,575 --> 01:26:23,542
What?

1187
01:26:23,676 --> 01:26:25,342
How old are you?

1188
01:26:27,676 --> 01:26:28,609
Wow, man.

1189
01:26:30,109 --> 01:26:31,909
That's the first time
anybody asked that

1190
01:26:32,043 --> 01:26:33,308
in a long time.

1191
01:26:33,442 --> 01:26:34,909
What's the answer?

1192
01:26:37,475 --> 01:26:40,876
Okay. We gonna play
kiddie games?

1193
01:26:42,175 --> 01:26:44,742
Eighteen. Feel better?

1194
01:26:44,876 --> 01:26:46,676
You got some ID,
you know,

1195
01:26:46,809 --> 01:26:48,976
like a driver's license
or something?

1196
01:26:49,109 --> 01:26:51,742
- Are you joking?
- No, I'm not.

1197
01:26:51,876 --> 01:26:55,342
I need to see something official
that verifies that you're 18,

1198
01:26:55,475 --> 01:26:58,242
which you don't have
because you're not.

1199
01:27:01,509 --> 01:27:04,009
Talk about a bring-down bummer,
dude.

1200
01:27:04,143 --> 01:27:05,208
That's you.

1201
01:27:05,342 --> 01:27:06,542
Yeah.

1202
01:27:11,109 --> 01:27:15,009
Obviously,
I'm not too young to fuck you.

1203
01:27:15,143 --> 01:27:17,308
But obviously,
you are too old to fuck me.

1204
01:27:18,842 --> 01:27:22,208
What I'm too old to do
is go to jail for poontang.

1205
01:27:24,175 --> 01:27:26,175
Prison's been trying to get me
all my life.

1206
01:27:26,308 --> 01:27:28,676
It ain't got me yet.
The day it does,

1207
01:27:28,809 --> 01:27:31,208
it won't be because of you.

1208
01:27:31,342 --> 01:27:32,475
No offense.

1209
01:27:35,442 --> 01:27:37,275
<i>You all right?</i>

1210
01:27:37,409 --> 01:27:39,776
She's just
fine, ain't you, shorty?

1211
01:27:39,909 --> 01:27:41,642
<i>I'm fine, Scott.</i>

1212
01:27:41,776 --> 01:27:43,208
<i>They haven't hurt you?</i>

1213
01:27:43,342 --> 01:27:45,143
Camera's ready, Mr. Dalton.

1214
01:27:46,842 --> 01:27:48,109
I'll be right out.

1215
01:27:49,509 --> 01:27:51,709
<i>The war.</i>

1216
01:27:51,842 --> 01:27:54,676
<i>I rode with
the British cavalry in Indi...</i>

1217
01:28:46,876 --> 01:28:49,509
Stand by, guys.
We're going in five.

1218
01:29:04,375 --> 01:29:06,876
Lancer's boys are here!

1219
01:29:07,009 --> 01:29:09,043
The old man here?

1220
01:29:09,175 --> 01:29:10,742
Nada.

1221
01:29:10,876 --> 01:29:12,342
But the son is.

1222
01:29:14,442 --> 01:29:16,409
Ah. Heh, heh.

1223
01:29:16,542 --> 01:29:18,009
The one from Boston.

1224
01:29:19,208 --> 01:29:20,143
I don't know.

1225
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:22,542
You from Boston?

1226
01:29:22,676 --> 01:29:23,709
Yes.

1227
01:29:23,842 --> 01:29:25,308
It's the Boston one!

1228
01:29:27,109 --> 01:29:28,909
Keep the others outside.

1229
01:29:30,143 --> 01:29:31,475
Let the brother come in.

1230
01:29:33,109 --> 01:29:34,842
You heard him, Boston.

1231
01:29:43,809 --> 01:29:45,609
Come on in, Boston.

1232
01:29:46,909 --> 01:29:48,342
See, honey?

1233
01:29:48,475 --> 01:29:50,676
I told you they'd come
to parlay.

1234
01:29:52,308 --> 01:29:53,542
You all right,
honey?

1235
01:29:53,676 --> 01:29:56,676
Oh, she's just fine.

1236
01:29:56,809 --> 01:29:58,475
Ain't you, shorty?

1237
01:29:59,676 --> 01:30:01,609
I'm fine, Scott.

1238
01:30:01,742 --> 01:30:03,509
They haven't hurt you?

1239
01:30:03,642 --> 01:30:05,709
Not yet, I ain't.

1240
01:30:05,842 --> 01:30:07,642
But that can all change...

1241
01:30:08,809 --> 01:30:09,676
like that.

1242
01:30:13,509 --> 01:30:14,976
Say...

1243
01:30:15,109 --> 01:30:16,776
where'd you get that limp?

1244
01:30:18,242 --> 01:30:19,542
- From the war.
- Mm.

1245
01:30:20,842 --> 01:30:22,442
Which side?

1246
01:30:22,575 --> 01:30:25,776
I rode with the British cavalry
in India.

1247
01:30:25,909 --> 01:30:27,475
Mm.

1248
01:30:27,609 --> 01:30:30,109
What'd they call that outfit?

1249
01:30:30,242 --> 01:30:31,642
Bengal Lancers.

1250
01:30:35,575 --> 01:30:37,609
Now, now, now,
that is funny.

1251
01:30:37,742 --> 01:30:40,175
- That is funny.
- That's not so funny.

1252
01:30:40,308 --> 01:30:41,542
Don't you get it?

1253
01:30:41,676 --> 01:30:43,542
"Bengal Lancer"?

1254
01:30:43,676 --> 01:30:45,009
Hm?

1255
01:30:45,143 --> 01:30:46,475
Oh, yeah.

1256
01:30:46,609 --> 01:30:48,208
I get it now.

1257
01:30:48,342 --> 01:30:51,409
- That is kind of funny.
- It is.

1258
01:30:51,542 --> 01:30:54,909
You do know kidnapping
is a hanging offense.

1259
01:30:55,043 --> 01:30:57,509
So is blowing the heads
off little girls.

1260
01:30:59,043 --> 01:31:02,043
But they can only hang me
once, right?

1261
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:04,143
So...

1262
01:31:05,776 --> 01:31:07,342
you come down here for a...

1263
01:31:07,475 --> 01:31:09,709
For a Boston social?

1264
01:31:09,842 --> 01:31:12,475
- Or we gonna talk price?
- How much?

1265
01:31:12,609 --> 01:31:16,575
I'd say $50,000 would buy me

1266
01:31:16,709 --> 01:31:20,175
a whole lot of chicken mole
in Mexico.

1267
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:21,709
That's a lot of money.

1268
01:31:21,842 --> 01:31:24,175
Well, she's a lot
of little girl.

1269
01:31:24,308 --> 01:31:26,076
Or don't you agree?

1270
01:31:26,208 --> 01:31:27,509
I agree.

1271
01:31:29,475 --> 01:31:31,143
So, what's next?

1272
01:31:31,275 --> 01:31:33,642
Well, I'll send one of my boys
out to your ranch

1273
01:31:33,776 --> 01:31:36,043
to fill you in
on all the details, but, uh...

1274
01:31:37,842 --> 01:31:41,742
the one detail I'm gonna fill
you in on right now is this:

1275
01:31:43,109 --> 01:31:46,043
I don't want
no beaner bronco buster

1276
01:31:46,175 --> 01:31:47,776
handing me that $50,000.

1277
01:31:47,909 --> 01:31:51,043
I want the old man himself.

1278
01:31:51,175 --> 01:31:56,709
Murdoch Lancer
puts $50,000 in my lap...

1279
01:31:56,842 --> 01:32:00,009
or I heave this little pitcher
down a well!

1280
01:32:00,143 --> 01:32:02,642
You got that, Boston?

1281
01:32:02,776 --> 01:32:04,509
Huh?

1282
01:32:04,642 --> 01:32:06,043
Yeah.

1283
01:32:06,175 --> 01:32:08,442
All right, messenger boy.

1284
01:32:09,976 --> 01:32:11,509
Deliver my message.

1285
01:32:18,275 --> 01:32:21,709
Give me evil, sexy Hamlet.

1286
01:32:21,842 --> 01:32:23,642
Settle into it.

1287
01:32:23,776 --> 01:32:25,776
Enjoy it.

1288
01:32:25,909 --> 01:32:27,009
And cut!

1289
01:32:29,676 --> 01:32:30,842
Oh, boy.

1290
01:32:30,976 --> 01:32:32,542
I didn't hurt you there,
Marabella,

1291
01:32:32,676 --> 01:32:35,009
- with that throw, did I?
- No, no, no. I'm good.

1292
01:32:35,143 --> 01:32:36,642
I got pads on.

1293
01:32:36,776 --> 01:32:38,776
And I throw myself on the floor

1294
01:32:38,909 --> 01:32:41,909
just for fun,
even when I'm not getting paid.

1295
01:32:42,043 --> 01:32:43,275
The gate's clean.

1296
01:32:43,409 --> 01:32:45,809
Rick, Rick, Rick.

1297
01:32:45,942 --> 01:32:47,509
Put her there.

1298
01:32:47,642 --> 01:32:48,742
- That was it.
- Really?

1299
01:32:48,876 --> 01:32:50,308
That was absolutely fantastic.

1300
01:32:50,442 --> 01:32:51,709
- Oh, thank you.
- I loved it.

1301
01:32:51,842 --> 01:32:53,709
Your idea about
throwing the little girl

1302
01:32:53,842 --> 01:32:55,642
on the ground
just worked like a charm.

1303
01:32:55,776 --> 01:32:57,742
I figured you said Shakespeare,
so... Yeah.

1304
01:32:57,876 --> 01:32:58,976
That's right. That was...

1305
01:32:59,109 --> 01:33:01,175
That's what I mean
by "scare me."

1306
01:33:01,308 --> 01:33:03,676
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Evil Hamlet scares people.

1307
01:33:03,809 --> 01:33:06,208
- All right.
- Oh, and by the way...

1308
01:33:06,342 --> 01:33:08,409
- "Beaner bronco buster"?
- Yeah.

1309
01:33:08,542 --> 01:33:10,076
Where the hell
did that come from?

1310
01:33:10,208 --> 01:33:12,342
- I don't know. Improv.
- That was wonderful.

1311
01:33:12,475 --> 01:33:15,909
It was just... That was
a triple alliterative improv.

1312
01:33:16,043 --> 01:33:17,509
You don't hear those
too often.

1313
01:33:17,642 --> 01:33:19,475
- Okay? We're good.
- All right. We don't...?

1314
01:33:19,609 --> 01:33:21,175
- Don't need to go again?
- We're done.

1315
01:33:21,308 --> 01:33:22,642
- That was fantastic.
- All right.

1316
01:33:22,776 --> 01:33:24,642
Okay, moving on.
We're in the bordello.

1317
01:33:24,776 --> 01:33:26,175
Next setup!

1318
01:33:29,976 --> 01:33:33,709
That was the best acting
I've ever seen in my whole life.

1319
01:33:35,175 --> 01:33:36,043
Thank you.

1320
01:33:36,175 --> 01:33:37,342
Heh.

1321
01:33:54,509 --> 01:33:55,976
Rick fucking Dalton.

1322
01:34:09,409 --> 01:34:10,509
That's a car.

1323
01:34:11,809 --> 01:34:13,275
That's a strange car.

1324
01:34:14,642 --> 01:34:16,976
Snake, go see
who's outside.

1325
01:34:29,442 --> 01:34:30,842
So who is it?

1326
01:34:30,976 --> 01:34:32,809
I ain't for sure yet.

1327
01:34:32,942 --> 01:34:35,143
It's a bitchen yellow
Coupe de Ville.

1328
01:34:35,275 --> 01:34:37,375
Keep an eye on him.

1329
01:35:26,175 --> 01:35:27,709
Come on.

1330
01:35:44,308 --> 01:35:46,043
Where the hell
is everybody?

1331
01:35:55,342 --> 01:35:56,776
Hey, where's Gypsy?

1332
01:35:56,909 --> 01:35:58,609
She's down
by the chop shop.

1333
01:36:05,442 --> 01:36:07,542
- Hey!
- Hello!

1334
01:36:07,676 --> 01:36:10,709
Gypsy! I want you
to come meet my new friend.

1335
01:36:10,842 --> 01:36:13,143
Some old-looking
dude in a Hawaiian shirt

1336
01:36:13,275 --> 01:36:14,942
who just gave Pussycat
a ride home.

1337
01:36:15,076 --> 01:36:16,676
He just gave her a lift?

1338
01:36:16,809 --> 01:36:18,809
Nope. She's bringing him

1339
01:36:18,942 --> 01:36:20,809
down the ranch
to meet everybody.

1340
01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:23,509
Stay by the door.
Tell me if he starts coming this way.

1341
01:36:25,676 --> 01:36:27,976
- Welcome to our community.
- Thanks for having me.

1342
01:36:28,109 --> 01:36:30,542
Thank you for giving
our precious Pussy a ride home.

1343
01:36:30,676 --> 01:36:31,876
Think nothing of it.

1344
01:36:32,009 --> 01:36:33,375
We love Pussy.

1345
01:36:33,509 --> 01:36:35,009
Yes, we do.

1346
01:36:35,143 --> 01:36:37,275
Hey, where is everybody?
Where's the children?

1347
01:36:37,409 --> 01:36:39,942
Everybody left
for Santa Barbara.

1348
01:36:40,076 --> 01:36:41,542
Really?

1349
01:36:41,676 --> 01:36:43,676
Charlie's gone?
Everybody left?

1350
01:36:43,809 --> 01:36:46,809
Well, not "everybody" everybody,
but mostly everybody.

1351
01:36:49,776 --> 01:36:50,676
Drag.

1352
01:36:52,076 --> 01:36:54,676
I really wanted Cliff
to meet Charlie.

1353
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:57,076
I think Charlie's
really gonna dig you.

1354
01:36:57,208 --> 01:36:59,509
- Angel, hold up.
- Well, maybe next time.

1355
01:36:59,642 --> 01:37:02,076
Yeah, you got to come back.

1356
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:04,175
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure.

1357
01:37:06,009 --> 01:37:09,009
So how's it all
comparing to your glory days?

1358
01:37:09,143 --> 01:37:10,709
Well, things have changed.

1359
01:37:14,109 --> 01:37:16,009
Not a bad mount, Connie.

1360
01:37:16,143 --> 01:37:18,475
I used to ride horses
every day back in Tennessee.

1361
01:37:18,609 --> 01:37:20,642
- Is that right?
- Every day?

1362
01:37:20,776 --> 01:37:22,676
Well, every week.

1363
01:37:22,809 --> 01:37:24,375
All right.

1364
01:37:24,509 --> 01:37:26,208
Ain't she just darling?

1365
01:37:29,842 --> 01:37:33,009
So, uh, my name is Lulu.

1366
01:37:33,143 --> 01:37:34,909
This is Tex.

1367
01:37:35,043 --> 01:37:37,308
We're gonna be leading you
on a great trail ride

1368
01:37:37,442 --> 01:37:39,809
through the beautiful
Santa Susana canyons.

1369
01:37:39,942 --> 01:37:43,143
Now, Curt, I hear you're already
an experienced rider.

1370
01:37:43,275 --> 01:37:45,542
- Yes.
- Yeah, so are you, Connie?

1371
01:37:45,676 --> 01:37:47,676
- Yes, I am.
- Hey, Tex? Come here.

1372
01:37:47,809 --> 01:37:50,308
So, uh, if you're both
experienced riders,

1373
01:37:50,442 --> 01:37:53,575
I guess we'll just make
this ride about having fun.

1374
01:37:53,709 --> 01:37:54,976
You ready to have some fun?

1375
01:37:55,109 --> 01:37:57,842
So Pussycat brought back
some guy with her.

1376
01:37:57,976 --> 01:37:59,942
Gypsy wants you
to go give him a look-see.

1377
01:38:00,076 --> 01:38:01,642
Yeah. Sure thing.

1378
01:38:20,475 --> 01:38:23,442
Oh, and here's someone
you absolutely have to meet.

1379
01:38:23,575 --> 01:38:25,876
One of our most favorite sons.

1380
01:38:26,009 --> 01:38:28,642
Tex, come on over here
and say hi to Cliff.

1381
01:38:28,776 --> 01:38:30,876
- Howdy, Cliff.
- Tex.

1382
01:38:31,009 --> 01:38:34,509
- What part of Texas you from?
- Oh, a place you never heard of.

1383
01:38:34,642 --> 01:38:35,509
Copeville.

1384
01:38:35,642 --> 01:38:37,842
Ah. Ever been to Houston?

1385
01:38:37,976 --> 01:38:39,442
Course I have.

1386
01:38:39,575 --> 01:38:42,043
Yeah, I spent two weeks once
on a Houston chain gang.

1387
01:38:42,175 --> 01:38:43,809
In August, no less.

1388
01:38:43,942 --> 01:38:46,342
That doesn't sound like
a whole lot of fun.

1389
01:38:46,475 --> 01:38:49,375
It's the last cop's jaw I ever
broke, I can tell you that.

1390
01:38:53,809 --> 01:38:54,709
Man...

1391
01:38:56,009 --> 01:38:58,475
Charlie's gonna dig you.

1392
01:38:58,609 --> 01:39:00,876
The Hawaiian guy
seems to be okay.

1393
01:39:01,009 --> 01:39:03,409
Everybody's talking
all friendly.

1394
01:39:03,542 --> 01:39:06,076
- Enjoy your day!
- Thank you.

1395
01:39:06,208 --> 01:39:09,375
Tex checked him out,
and now he's riding away.

1396
01:39:09,509 --> 01:39:11,809
If he comes this
way, let me know.

1397
01:39:14,475 --> 01:39:17,043
Hey, does George Spahn
still own this ranch?

1398
01:39:17,175 --> 01:39:19,709
Yeah, George
still owns it.

1399
01:39:19,842 --> 01:39:22,275
- Does he still live here?
- Yeah.

1400
01:39:22,409 --> 01:39:25,242
Does he still live
right there?

1401
01:39:25,375 --> 01:39:26,342
Yeah.

1402
01:39:26,475 --> 01:39:27,742
Is he here now?

1403
01:39:27,876 --> 01:39:29,475
I guess so.

1404
01:39:31,475 --> 01:39:34,076
So George gave you all
permission to be here?

1405
01:39:34,079 --> 01:39:34,184
Course he did.

1406
01:39:34,187 --> 01:39:34,309
And y'all take care of him?

1407
01:39:34,312 --> 01:39:34,418
Oh, we take care
of George.

1408
01:39:34,421 --> 01:39:34,527
We love George.

1409
01:39:35,259 --> 01:39:36,659
Well,
is there anything wrong

1410
01:39:36,792 --> 01:39:38,959
with me saying hello
to an old friend?

1411
01:39:39,092 --> 01:39:40,859
You can't see him
right now.

1412
01:39:40,992 --> 01:39:43,226
Why can't I see him
right now?

1413
01:39:44,826 --> 01:39:46,492
Because
he's napping.

1414
01:39:48,293 --> 01:39:50,293
This is his nap time.

1415
01:39:59,792 --> 01:40:02,358
Well, I think I'll just
go see for myself.

1416
01:40:03,725 --> 01:40:05,525
You never know.

1417
01:40:05,659 --> 01:40:07,325
He might have just woke up.

1418
01:40:16,892 --> 01:40:19,026
The old Hawaiian
guy's coming this way.

1419
01:40:20,259 --> 01:40:21,859
Okay, y'all, beat it.

1420
01:40:21,992 --> 01:40:23,325
I'll handle this guy.

1421
01:40:27,425 --> 01:40:28,425
Fine.

1422
01:41:14,026 --> 01:41:15,525
You the mama bear?

1423
01:41:17,325 --> 01:41:19,392
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

1424
01:41:19,525 --> 01:41:22,492
I'm an old friend of George's.
Thought I'd stop and say hello.

1425
01:41:22,625 --> 01:41:23,992
That's very nice of you,

1426
01:41:24,126 --> 01:41:25,992
but you picked
the wrong time.

1427
01:41:26,126 --> 01:41:28,059
George is taking a nap
right now.

1428
01:41:28,193 --> 01:41:30,059
Oh, that is unfortunate.

1429
01:41:30,193 --> 01:41:31,458
Yes, it is.

1430
01:41:32,826 --> 01:41:35,226
- What's your name?
- Cliff Booth.

1431
01:41:35,358 --> 01:41:36,725
How do you know George?

1432
01:41:36,859 --> 01:41:39,226
I used to shoot Westerns
here at the ranch.

1433
01:41:39,358 --> 01:41:41,625
When was the last time
you saw George?

1434
01:41:41,759 --> 01:41:44,959
Oh, I'd say about...

1435
01:41:45,859 --> 01:41:47,193
eight years ago.

1436
01:41:48,759 --> 01:41:50,293
Oh. I'm sorry.

1437
01:41:50,425 --> 01:41:52,559
I didn't realize the two of you
were so close.

1438
01:41:52,692 --> 01:41:54,392
When he wakes up,

1439
01:41:54,525 --> 01:41:56,625
I'll let him know you came by.

1440
01:41:56,759 --> 01:41:59,259
I'd really like to say
a quick hello now

1441
01:41:59,425 --> 01:42:00,625
while I'm here.

1442
01:42:00,759 --> 01:42:02,259
Came a long ways.

1443
01:42:02,392 --> 01:42:05,126
Don't know when I'll get back
this way again.

1444
01:42:05,259 --> 01:42:08,692
Oh, I understand, but I'm
afraid that's impossible.

1445
01:42:08,826 --> 01:42:10,458
Impossible?

1446
01:42:10,592 --> 01:42:12,325
Why is that impossible?

1447
01:42:12,458 --> 01:42:14,692
Me and George like
to watch TV on Sunday night...

1448
01:42:14,826 --> 01:42:16,959
<i>F.B.I.</i> and <i>Bonanza.</i>
...but George finds it hard

1449
01:42:17,092 --> 01:42:18,525
to keep awake,
so I make him nap

1450
01:42:18,659 --> 01:42:20,792
so I don't get gypped out
of my TV time.

1451
01:42:20,926 --> 01:42:22,159
Ah.

1452
01:42:23,492 --> 01:42:27,525
Well, look, Red,
I'm coming in there.

1453
01:42:27,659 --> 01:42:31,659
With my own two eyes, I'm gonna
get a good look at George.

1454
01:42:32,458 --> 01:42:33,625
And this...

1455
01:42:35,625 --> 01:42:37,259
ain't stopping me.

1456
01:42:40,725 --> 01:42:41,625
Okay.

1457
01:42:42,826 --> 01:42:44,358
Suit yourself.

1458
01:44:10,325 --> 01:44:11,992
He back there?

1459
01:44:13,325 --> 01:44:15,293
Door at the end
of the hallway.

1460
01:44:16,592 --> 01:44:18,126
You might have to
shake him awake.

1461
01:44:18,259 --> 01:44:19,992
I fucked his brains out
this morning.

1462
01:44:25,259 --> 01:44:27,259
He may be tired.

1463
01:44:38,826 --> 01:44:40,492
Oh, Mr. Eight Years Ago?

1464
01:44:42,325 --> 01:44:43,792
George is blind,

1465
01:44:43,926 --> 01:44:46,458
so you'll probably
have to tell him who you are.

1466
01:45:11,926 --> 01:45:13,358
George, you awake?

1467
01:45:31,759 --> 01:45:32,692
George?

1468
01:45:35,092 --> 01:45:36,026
George?

1469
01:45:40,092 --> 01:45:40,992
George?

1470
01:45:43,859 --> 01:45:46,358
- George!
- Jesus.

1471
01:45:46,492 --> 01:45:48,992
- Hi, George.
- Wait a minute.

1472
01:45:49,126 --> 01:45:51,159
- What's going on?
- Everything's all right.

1473
01:45:51,293 --> 01:45:54,358
- I'm sorry to disturb you.
- Uh... Who are you?

1474
01:45:54,492 --> 01:45:56,358
It's Cliff Booth.

1475
01:45:56,492 --> 01:45:59,559
Just stopped in to say hello
and see how you're doing.

1476
01:45:59,692 --> 01:46:01,159
John Wilkes Booth?

1477
01:46:01,293 --> 01:46:02,625
No, Cliff Booth.

1478
01:46:04,959 --> 01:46:06,193
Who's that?

1479
01:46:06,325 --> 01:46:08,859
I used to shoot
<i>Bounty Law</i> here, George.

1480
01:46:08,992 --> 01:46:10,959
I was Rick Dalton's
stunt double.

1481
01:46:11,092 --> 01:46:13,859
- Who?
- Rick Dalton.

1482
01:46:13,992 --> 01:46:15,525
The Dalton Brothers?

1483
01:46:15,659 --> 01:46:17,259
No, Rick Dalton.

1484
01:46:18,792 --> 01:46:19,959
Who's that?

1485
01:46:20,092 --> 01:46:22,859
He was the star
of <i>Bounty Law.</i>

1486
01:46:22,992 --> 01:46:24,659
And who are you?

1487
01:46:24,792 --> 01:46:26,425
I was Rick's stunt double.

1488
01:46:27,625 --> 01:46:29,492
Rick who?

1489
01:46:29,625 --> 01:46:31,325
It don't matter, George.

1490
01:46:31,458 --> 01:46:34,492
We were colleagues
from the past, and I just wanted

1491
01:46:34,625 --> 01:46:36,458
to make sure
you're doing okay.

1492
01:46:36,592 --> 01:46:38,859
- I'm not doing okay.
- What's the matter?

1493
01:46:38,992 --> 01:46:40,659
Can't see shit.

1494
01:46:40,792 --> 01:46:42,525
Would you call that
"the matter"?

1495
01:46:42,659 --> 01:46:44,358
The man can't see shit,
okay?

1496
01:46:44,492 --> 01:46:46,926
I know. I'm sorry about that.
I was told.

1497
01:46:47,059 --> 01:46:49,625
Squeaky
sent me to bed.

1498
01:46:49,759 --> 01:46:51,992
Would that be
the little redhead out front?

1499
01:46:54,992 --> 01:46:57,425
What the fuck
is the matter with you?

1500
01:46:57,559 --> 01:46:58,992
First you wake me up,

1501
01:46:59,126 --> 01:47:01,492
and now you're pretending
that I didn't tell you

1502
01:47:01,625 --> 01:47:03,659
I was fucking blind!

1503
01:47:03,792 --> 01:47:06,826
How am I gonna know
what the hell color the head

1504
01:47:06,959 --> 01:47:09,659
of the girl is that's with me
all the time?

1505
01:47:09,792 --> 01:47:11,559
Oh, fair enough, George.

1506
01:47:15,092 --> 01:47:18,358
- No. Jesus Christ.
- Come on, George. All right.

1507
01:47:18,492 --> 01:47:20,992
Everyone
don't need a stuntman.

1508
01:47:28,625 --> 01:47:31,026
I don't know who you are...

1509
01:47:32,692 --> 01:47:34,692
but you touched me today.

1510
01:47:36,692 --> 01:47:39,193
You came to visit me.

1511
01:47:39,325 --> 01:47:41,358
Now I got to go back to sleep.

1512
01:47:43,926 --> 01:47:46,559
I got to watch
<i>F.B.I.</i> tonight.

1513
01:47:46,692 --> 01:47:48,193
I watch it with Squeaky.

1514
01:47:49,659 --> 01:47:53,126
She gets all pissed off
if I fall asleep.

1515
01:47:53,259 --> 01:47:56,059
What happens when she
gets pissed off, George?

1516
01:47:57,425 --> 01:47:58,458
Nothing.

1517
01:48:00,126 --> 01:48:02,458
I just don't like
to disappoint her.

1518
01:48:07,358 --> 01:48:11,026
So you gave all these hippies
permission to be here?

1519
01:48:16,592 --> 01:48:18,992
Just who the fuck are you?

1520
01:48:19,126 --> 01:48:20,992
I'm Cliff Booth.

1521
01:48:21,126 --> 01:48:22,325
I'm a stuntman.

1522
01:48:22,458 --> 01:48:24,625
We used to work together,
George.

1523
01:48:24,759 --> 01:48:27,458
And I just want
to make sure you're okay.

1524
01:48:27,592 --> 01:48:31,259
And that all these hippies
aren't taking advantage of you.

1525
01:48:31,392 --> 01:48:34,126
- Squeaky?
- Yeah.

1526
01:48:34,259 --> 01:48:36,525
She loves me.

1527
01:48:38,725 --> 01:48:40,826
So suck on that.

1528
01:48:49,293 --> 01:48:50,959
You take care, George.

1529
01:48:57,792 --> 01:48:59,425
Goddamn it.

1530
01:49:20,859 --> 01:49:22,325
You embarrassed me.

1531
01:49:23,325 --> 01:49:25,659
Yeah, sorry about that.

1532
01:49:28,126 --> 01:49:29,859
How'd your little talk
with George go?

1533
01:49:29,992 --> 01:49:30,992
Are we kidnapping him?

1534
01:49:31,126 --> 01:49:32,859
Not the word I'd use.

1535
01:49:32,992 --> 01:49:35,193
Now you've talked to him, you
believe everything's all right?

1536
01:49:35,325 --> 01:49:37,159
Not exactly.

1537
01:49:37,293 --> 01:49:39,193
This was a mistake.
You should leave.

1538
01:49:39,325 --> 01:49:41,059
Way ahead of you.

1539
01:49:45,193 --> 01:49:47,325
George isn't blind!

1540
01:49:47,458 --> 01:49:49,026
You're the blind one!

1541
01:50:33,826 --> 01:50:35,492
You do that?

1542
01:50:40,592 --> 01:50:42,625
You know, that's not my car.

1543
01:50:42,759 --> 01:50:44,826
That's my boss's car.

1544
01:50:44,959 --> 01:50:47,259
And if something were to happen
to my boss's car,

1545
01:50:47,392 --> 01:50:48,826
well, I'd get in trouble.

1546
01:51:07,126 --> 01:51:08,525
Fix it.

1547
01:51:08,659 --> 01:51:10,826
Fuck you.

1548
01:51:37,026 --> 01:51:39,226
- Leave him alone!
- He's a flower!

1549
01:51:39,358 --> 01:51:40,892
He's a flower, man.

1550
01:51:41,026 --> 01:51:43,358
He's just a flower.
He doesn't know better.

1551
01:51:43,492 --> 01:51:45,293
Ladies.

1552
01:51:51,325 --> 01:51:54,358
Come one step closer
and I will knock his teeth out.

1553
01:52:05,759 --> 01:52:07,392
Fix it.

1554
01:52:07,525 --> 01:52:09,792
Can I at least get a rag
to wipe my face first?

1555
01:52:09,926 --> 01:52:11,392
Nope.

1556
01:52:11,525 --> 01:52:13,193
Tire first.

1557
01:52:23,159 --> 01:52:25,193
- Sundance.
- Yeah.

1558
01:52:25,325 --> 01:52:28,826
Get on a horse, go get Tex
and get his ass down here.

1559
01:52:28,959 --> 01:52:29,859
Okay.

1560
01:52:39,159 --> 01:52:40,859
<i>I love you.</i>

1561
01:53:05,226 --> 01:53:07,659
Tex! Tex!

1562
01:53:07,792 --> 01:53:09,492
That Hawaiian guy's
back at the ranch

1563
01:53:09,625 --> 01:53:10,792
kicking Clem's face in.

1564
01:53:10,926 --> 01:53:12,692
Ah, son of a...

1565
01:53:12,826 --> 01:53:14,293
I'll take over for Tex.

1566
01:53:14,425 --> 01:53:16,092
Right this way.

1567
01:53:42,692 --> 01:53:44,525
Hyah! Hyah!

1568
01:54:06,293 --> 01:54:07,959
Clem, you all right?

1569
01:54:29,159 --> 01:54:30,792
How do?

1570
01:54:30,926 --> 01:54:34,193
What a day.
Shit, I almost lost my shit.

1571
01:55:22,259 --> 01:55:23,458
You, uh...

1572
01:55:23,592 --> 01:55:25,659
You want to come in
and watch my <i>F.B.I.?</i>

1573
01:55:25,792 --> 01:55:28,559
Why, I just figured we would.
I got a six-pack in the back.

1574
01:55:28,692 --> 01:55:29,959
Thought we'd order a pizza.

1575
01:55:30,092 --> 01:55:31,325
All right.

1576
01:55:31,458 --> 01:55:32,725
All right.

1579

<i>and back at El Toro
before my kids go to bed.</i>

1580
01:56:06,126 --> 01:56:09,859
Hey, bought me
an acid-dipped cigarette today.

1581
01:56:09,992 --> 01:56:11,293
Oh, yeah?

1582
01:56:11,425 --> 01:56:13,458
You want to buy
a cigarette dipped in acid?

1583
01:56:13,592 --> 01:56:15,126
Yeah.

1584
01:56:15,259 --> 01:56:17,293
If I'm gonna trip,
I want to trip here, man.

1585
01:56:17,425 --> 01:56:19,492
Walk in the woods.
Not in my home.

1586
01:56:21,458 --> 01:56:22,625
Just gonna stash it here.

1587
01:56:22,759 --> 01:56:24,859
- Don't smoke it by mistake.
- Yeah.

1588
01:56:24,992 --> 01:56:27,826
You want to smoke some,
smoke some. Just save me some.

1589
01:56:27,959 --> 01:56:31,193
Nah, I don't need
to trip out on no acid.

1590
01:56:31,325 --> 01:56:33,159
My booze don't need no buddy.

1591
01:56:33,293 --> 01:56:34,492
Whoa! Oh!

1592
01:56:34,625 --> 01:56:36,458
Here I come. Here I come.

1593
01:56:38,492 --> 01:56:39,692
Mm.

1594
01:56:39,826 --> 01:56:41,859
<i>What's the trouble, corporal?</i>

1595
01:56:41,992 --> 01:56:43,525
<i>There's a truck tailing us,
sir.</i>

1596

<i>It might be a farmer

1597
01:56:51,126 --> 01:56:52,792
<i>Oh, fine.</i>

1598
01:56:52,926 --> 01:56:55,092
<i>Well,
take it as fast as you can.</i>

1599
01:56:55,226 --> 01:56:56,293
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1600
01:56:59,625 --> 01:57:00,926
That PCH?

1601
01:57:01,059 --> 01:57:04,026
Yeah, yeah. Malibu.

1602
01:57:04,159 --> 01:57:06,458
Puerco Canyon or some shit.
I don't know.

1603
01:57:12,293 --> 01:57:14,959
Uh-oh. Here comes trouble.

1604
01:57:18,126 --> 01:57:19,458
Boom! Ha, ha!

1605
01:57:19,592 --> 01:57:21,525
Oh, man. Right in the face.

1606
01:57:33,458 --> 01:57:34,992
That was a smooth leap.

1607
01:57:35,126 --> 01:57:36,026
Thank you.

1608
01:57:39,358 --> 01:57:42,193
Dead number two.

1609
01:57:48,926 --> 01:57:50,659
I like that shot.

1610
01:57:50,792 --> 01:57:53,293
That guy's a fucking prick.

1611
01:57:59,592 --> 01:58:01,525
Um, that's Bobby Hogan.
Good guy.

1612

All right, get ready

<i>in the Italian film industry.</i>

Yes, Mr. Schwarz.

1640
01:59:44,625 --> 01:59:45,792
Two words.

1641
01:59:45,926 --> 01:59:48,358
Nebraska Jim, Sergio Corbucci.

1642
01:59:48,492 --> 01:59:50,392
N-Nebraska what?

1643
01:59:50,525 --> 01:59:51,525
Sergio who?

1644
01:59:51,659 --> 01:59:53,193
<i>Sergio Corbucci.</i>

1645
01:59:53,325 --> 01:59:54,792
A-and who's that?

1646
01:59:54,926 --> 01:59:56,325
The second-best director

1647
01:59:56,458 --> 01:59:58,559
of Spaghetti Westerns
in the whole wide world.

1648
01:59:58,692 --> 02:00:01,992
He's doing a new Western.
It's called <i>Nebraska Jim.</i>

1649
02:00:02,126 --> 02:00:04,559
And because of me,
he's considering you.

1650
02:00:04,692 --> 02:00:07,559
<i>Well, Rick got</i> Nebraska Jim.

1651
02:00:07,692 --> 02:00:10,059
<i>And Rick made a rather
compelling Nebraska Jim,</i>

1652
02:00:10,193 --> 02:00:12,559
<i>existing quite nicely
within Sergio Corbucci's</i>

<i>rogues gallery of antiheroes.</i>

1654
02:00:16,458 --> 02:00:18,026
<i>In Rome,
Rick loved the paparazzi</i>

1655
02:00:18,159 --> 02:00:19,692
<i>and the fuss
they made over him</i>

1656
02:00:19,826 --> 02:00:23,358
<i>and his</i> Nebraska Jim
<i>costar Daphna Ben-Cobo.</i>

1657
02:00:23,492 --> 02:00:26,992
All right there, paparazzos.
All right. Take it easy.

1658
02:00:27,126 --> 02:00:29,725
<i>He loved the food
so much that during his stay,</i>

1659
02:00:29,859 --> 02:00:31,692
<i>Rick gained
almost 15 pounds.</i>

1660
02:00:31,826 --> 02:00:34,692
<i>But he didn't love the
Italians' way of making movies.</i>

1661
02:00:34,826 --> 02:00:36,492
<i>In fact,
he thought the post-synced,</i>

1662
02:00:36,625 --> 02:00:38,492
<i>"every actor
speaks their own language,"</i>

1665

<i>While in Rome,
Marvin plugged Rick</i>

1666
02:00:45,492 --> 02:00:47,259
<i>into three other
Italian productions.</i>

1667

1672

<i>His third was
an Italian/Spanish coproduction</i>

1673
02:00:59,992 --> 02:01:01,692

<i>James Bond rip-off-type flick</i>

<i>Italian sojourn
fairly profitable,</i>

<i>although his swank
Roman apartment</i>

1684

<i>ate up a big chunk

1685
02:02:12,425 --> 02:02:15,492
<i>So as Rick returns to Hollywood

1692
02:02:31,026 --> 02:02:34,159
<i>Rick was really not sure
about what lay ahead for him.</i>

1693
02:02:36,592 --> 02:02:38,826
<i>Way back in coach,</i>

1694
02:02:38,959 --> 02:02:41,226
<i>working on his
bottomless Bloody Mary,</i>

1695
02:02:41,358 --> 02:02:44,859
<i>Cliff Booth returned
to Los Angeles as well.</i>

1696
02:02:44,992 --> 02:02:46,425
<i>He kept Rick company</i>

1697
02:02:46,559 --> 02:02:49,525
<i>during his entire
six-month stay in Italy.</i>

1698
02:02:49,659 --> 02:02:52,926
<i>However,
as the two men return home,</i>

1699
02:02:53,059 --> 02:02:54,659
<i>they've come
to an understanding.</i>

1700
02:02:54,792 --> 02:02:56,092
Well, here it goes now.

1701
02:02:57,659 --> 02:02:58,625
With the, uh...

1702
02:03:00,126 --> 02:03:01,659
With the new wife, I, uh...

1703
02:03:03,126 --> 02:03:06,126
I just I can't afford you
anymore, Cliff.

1704
02:03:06,259 --> 02:03:09,625
You know? I can barely afford
my own house anymore.

1705
02:03:09,759 --> 02:03:12,425
So I think the plan
is to sell the house

1706
02:03:12,559 --> 02:03:16,325
and buy-buy a condo in-in-in
Toluca Lake, bank the money.

1707
02:03:16,458 --> 02:03:19,092
You know, live off it.
That type of thing.

1708
02:03:19,226 --> 02:03:22,092
Hopefully,
I score come next pilot season.

1709
02:03:22,226 --> 02:03:23,358
That's a good plan.

1710
02:03:23,492 --> 02:03:25,525
Yeah. You know,

1711
02:03:25,659 --> 02:03:28,026
by then, I'll know
if I have a career or not,

1712
02:03:28,159 --> 02:03:32,159
if I'm a solid Los Angeles
citizen like Eddie O'Brien says,

1713
02:03:32,293 --> 02:03:36,525
or if I'm one step closer
to going back to Missouri.

1714
02:03:36,659 --> 02:03:39,926
So when this whole
European journey is over,

1715
02:03:40,059 --> 02:03:41,126
I think we've, uh...

1716
02:03:42,792 --> 02:03:45,193
We've reached
the end of the trail, Cliff.

1717
02:03:52,361 --> 02:03:52,467
<i>So these last
four Italian flicks,</i>

1718
02:03:52,470 --> 02:03:52,576
<i>after nine years together,</i>

1719
02:03:52,579 --> 02:03:52,686
<i>would be Rick and Cliff's
final rodeo.</i>

1720
02:03:52,689 --> 02:03:52,795
<i>Cliff doesn't have a clue
what he's gonna do.</i>

1721
02:03:52,798 --> 02:03:52,913
<i>The only thing the two men
know of for sure:</i>

1722
02:03:52,916 --> 02:03:53,069
<i>Tonight,
Rick and Cliff will have</i>

1723
02:03:53,072 --> 02:03:53,178
<i>a good old-fashioned drunk.</i>

1724
02:03:53,181 --> 02:03:53,420
<i>Both men know, once the plane
touches down in El Segundo,</i>

1725
02:03:53,420 --> 02:03:53,514
<i>it'll be the end of an era
for both of them.</i>

1726
02:03:56,167 --> 02:03:58,668
<i>And when you come to the end
of the line with a buddy</i>

1727
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:01,501
<i>who is more than a brother
and a little less than a wife,</i>

1728
02:04:01,634 --> 02:04:03,034

02:15:55,434 --> 02:15:57,334
but fucking drive it,
and drive it now!

1884
02:15:57,467 --> 02:15:59,034
Okay. Okay. Stop yelling.

1885
02:15:59,167 --> 02:16:00,701
Hold your horses. We're leaving.

1886
02:16:04,601 --> 02:16:08,267
The hell are you looking at,
you little ginger-haired fucker?

1887
02:16:08,401 --> 02:16:12,267
Hey, you come around here again,
I'm gonna call the fucking cops!

1888
02:16:17,967 --> 02:16:19,434
Dirty fucking hippies.

1889
02:16:32,401 --> 02:16:34,100
There in his
fancy fucking house,

1890
02:16:34,234 --> 02:16:35,867
thinking he's handled it.

1891
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,601
But he's seen us.
He's awake. He's alert.

1892
02:16:38,734 --> 02:16:41,967
They're all awake. They're
listening to fucking records.

1893
02:16:42,100 --> 02:16:43,501
Everybody's fucking awake!

1894
02:16:43,634 --> 02:16:44,768
Look!

1895
02:16:44,900 --> 02:16:47,367
- What did Charlie say?
- He said:

1896
02:16:47,501 --> 02:16:51,534
"Go to Terry's old house
and kill everybody in there."

1897
02:16:51,668 --> 02:16:55,334
And you heard him yourself.
He said, "Make it witchy."

1898
02:16:55,467 --> 02:16:58,467
Now, he either said that,

1899
02:16:58,601 --> 02:17:00,334
or I'm a liar.

1900
02:17:01,800 --> 02:17:04,900
Now, are any one of you
calling me a liar?

1901
02:17:05,967 --> 02:17:07,501
Hm?

1902
02:17:07,634 --> 02:17:09,467
How about you?

1903
02:17:09,601 --> 02:17:11,100
Are you calling me a liar?

1904
02:17:12,567 --> 02:17:14,601
No, of course not.

1905
02:17:14,734 --> 02:17:15,601
Good.

1906
02:17:15,734 --> 02:17:17,100
Hold it.

1907
02:17:17,234 --> 02:17:19,668
- Was that Rick Dalton?
- Who?

1908
02:17:19,800 --> 02:17:21,000
The guy from <i>Bounty Law.</i>

1909
02:17:21,134 --> 02:17:22,833
- Who, Jake Cahill?
- Yeah.

1910
02:17:22,967 --> 02:17:25,900
That guy in the robe
was Jake Cahill.

1911
02:17:26,034 --> 02:17:28,267
Wait a minute.
That was fucking Jake Cahill

1912
02:17:28,401 --> 02:17:29,833
that just yelled at me?

1913
02:17:29,967 --> 02:17:31,734
He was older,
but, yeah, I think so.

1914
02:17:31,867 --> 02:17:32,967
So who's this Rick guy?

1915
02:17:33,100 --> 02:17:34,900
Jesus Christ, Sadie,
get it together.

1916
02:17:35,034 --> 02:17:37,234
Rick Dalton played Jake Cahill
on a cowboy show

1917
02:17:37,367 --> 02:17:38,734
in the '50s called
<i>Bounty Law.</i>

1918
02:17:38,867 --> 02:17:40,167
Fuck you, Katie.

1919
02:17:40,301 --> 02:17:41,668
Sorry I don't know
the name

1920
02:17:41,800 --> 02:17:43,567
of every fascist on TV
in the '50s.

1921
02:17:43,701 --> 02:17:48,134
I can't believe that asshole
in the robe was Jake Cahill.

1922
02:17:48,267 --> 02:17:51,000
When I was a kid,
I had a <i>Bounty Law</i> lunch box.

1923
02:17:51,134 --> 02:17:53,401
That was my favorite
of all my lunch boxes.

1924
02:17:54,768 --> 02:17:57,467
Dig this!

1925
02:17:57,601 --> 02:17:59,467
When we've been having
our trip sessions,

1926
02:17:59,601 --> 02:18:02,134
I've been expanding
on this one idea in my head.

1927
02:18:02,267 --> 02:18:03,768
All right, dig it.

1928
02:18:03,900 --> 02:18:07,367
We all grew up watching TV,
you know what I mean?

1929
02:18:07,501 --> 02:18:09,034
And if you grew up watching TV,

1930
02:18:09,167 --> 02:18:11,034
that means you grew up
watching murder.

1931
02:18:11,167 --> 02:18:12,034
Mm-hm.

1932
02:18:12,167 --> 02:18:13,800
Every show on TV

1933
02:18:13,933 --> 02:18:16,668
that wasn't <i>I Love Lucy</i>
was about murder.

1934
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:19,867
So my idea is...

1935
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,334
we kill the people
who taught us to kill.

1936
02:18:24,401 --> 02:18:25,967
I mean,
where the fuck are we, man?

1937
02:18:26,100 --> 02:18:28,501
We are in fucking Hollywood,
man.

1938
02:18:28,634 --> 02:18:30,434
The people
an entire generation grew up

1939
02:18:30,567 --> 02:18:32,200
watching kill people
live here.

1940
02:18:32,334 --> 02:18:34,301
And they live
in pig-shit fucking luxury.

1941
02:18:34,434 --> 02:18:35,933
I say fuck them.

1942
02:18:36,067 --> 02:18:38,501
I say we cut their cocks off
and make them eat it.

1943
02:18:38,634 --> 02:18:40,800
That's a great idea, Sadie.

1944
02:18:43,234 --> 02:18:44,967
You two ready
to kill some piggies?

1945
02:18:54,434 --> 02:18:56,634
Wait a minute. Oh, shit.

1946
02:18:56,768 --> 02:18:59,134
Sorry, I forgot my knife
in the car.

1947
02:18:59,267 --> 02:19:01,067
Can I go...?
Can I go back and get it?

1948
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:03,467
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

1949
02:19:03,601 --> 02:19:05,567
- Go on. Wait a minute.
- What?

1950
02:19:05,701 --> 02:19:07,800
I locked the car.
You'll need keys to get in.

1951
02:19:10,867 --> 02:19:12,000
Oh.

1952
02:19:12,134 --> 02:19:13,967
Right. Thank you.

1953
02:19:14,100 --> 02:19:16,734
- Okay. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

1954
02:19:16,867 --> 02:19:19,833
- Just hurry up.
- Yeah, just a little minute.

1955
02:19:30,134 --> 02:19:31,768
Oh, that fucking bitch!

1956
02:19:31,900 --> 02:19:33,000
Shh! Calm down.

1957
02:19:33,134 --> 02:19:34,800
There's a fucking house
right there.

1958
02:19:36,100 --> 02:19:37,100
What do we do now?

1959
02:19:37,234 --> 02:19:38,668
We do what we came to do.

1960
02:19:38,800 --> 02:19:41,567
And when we're done,
we split up and hitch home.

1961
02:19:41,701 --> 02:19:42,900
Any more questions?

1962
02:19:43,034 --> 02:19:44,267
Hm?

1963
02:19:46,200 --> 02:19:48,967
Okay, pig killers,
let's kill some piggies.

1964
02:19:49,100 --> 02:19:50,301
All right.

1965
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:04,800
Oh, someone's hungry.

1966
02:20:13,567 --> 02:20:14,668
All right.

1967
02:20:16,601 --> 02:20:18,467
It's feeding time.

1968
02:20:21,467 --> 02:20:22,634
Brandy, couch.

1969
02:20:29,267 --> 02:20:30,634
And don't you mo...

1970
02:20:39,100 --> 02:20:41,034
Oh, man.

1971
02:20:43,768 --> 02:20:44,668
Uh...

1972
02:20:50,134 --> 02:20:52,167
The train
has left the station.

1973
02:20:59,100 --> 02:21:00,334
Bad idea.

1974
02:22:00,900 --> 02:22:02,401
Whoa.

1975
02:22:49,734 --> 02:22:52,867
You go around there,
see if there's a back entrance.

1976
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:54,833
All right? Go.

1977
02:23:41,800 --> 02:23:43,100
Hey.

1978
02:23:46,134 --> 02:23:50,167
I am doing the best I can
under the circumstances.

1979
02:23:50,301 --> 02:23:52,467
Now, I do not want
to get into it tonight.

1980
02:24:01,900 --> 02:24:04,634
Uh... can I help you?

1981
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:12,034
Shit.

1982
02:24:13,434 --> 02:24:15,267
How many other people
are here?

1983
02:24:15,401 --> 02:24:18,167
Oh, just the one sleeping
in the back there.

1984
02:24:19,768 --> 02:24:22,501
Go get him and bring him
into the living room.

1985
02:24:22,634 --> 02:24:23,768
What if he says no?

1986
02:24:23,900 --> 02:24:25,367
Don't take no for an answer.

1987
02:24:25,501 --> 02:24:28,034
You're the one with the knife.
Get him in here!

1988
02:24:30,334 --> 02:24:31,833
Hey.

1989
02:24:37,234 --> 02:24:39,034
You are real, right?

1990
02:24:39,167 --> 02:24:41,800
I'm as real as a doughnut,
motherfucker.

1991
02:24:51,668 --> 02:24:53,100
What the fuck?

1992
02:25:00,034 --> 02:25:01,301
Go to the living room.

1993
02:25:01,434 --> 02:25:03,100
What is going on, huh?

1994
02:25:08,167 --> 02:25:09,867
- Go!
- Okay. <i>Si, si.</i>

1995
02:25:12,234 --> 02:25:13,601
Who the fuck's that?

1996
02:25:13,734 --> 02:25:14,634
I don't know.

1997
02:25:16,034 --> 02:25:16,967
Francesca.

1998
02:25:23,768 --> 02:25:26,434
Oh. Uh...

1999
02:25:26,567 --> 02:25:28,301
What...?

2000
02:25:28,434 --> 02:25:30,134
Oh, I know you.

2001
02:25:30,267 --> 02:25:32,000
I know all three of you.

2002
02:25:33,301 --> 02:25:35,833
Yeah. Spahn Ranch.

2003
02:25:35,967 --> 02:25:38,634
Spahn Ranch. Yeah. Hoo!

2004
02:25:40,267 --> 02:25:44,100
I don't know your name,
but I remember that hair.

2005
02:25:44,234 --> 02:25:47,734
And you, I remember
your white little face.

2006
02:25:47,867 --> 02:25:49,768
And you were on a horsie.

2007
02:25:49,900 --> 02:25:51,634
Yeah.

2008
02:25:51,768 --> 02:25:54,833
Uh... You are...?

2009
02:25:54,967 --> 02:25:56,800
I'm the devil,

2010
02:25:56,933 --> 02:26:00,267
and I'm here to do
the devil's business.

2011
02:26:02,967 --> 02:26:06,601
Nah, it was dumber than that.
Something like... Rex.

2012
02:26:06,734 --> 02:26:08,734
- God, shoot him, Tex!
- Tex.

2013
02:26:12,234 --> 02:26:13,334
Fuck!

2014
02:26:28,434 --> 02:26:29,833
Son of a bitch!

2015
02:27:08,267 --> 02:27:09,167
Hey, you.

2016
02:27:12,234 --> 02:27:14,367
How dare you come into my house,
motherfucker!

2017
02:27:40,434 --> 02:27:42,100
Wow, man.

2018
02:28:35,234 --> 02:28:36,334
What the fuck?

2019
02:28:37,833 --> 02:28:39,367
Jesus Christ.

2020
02:29:56,067 --> 02:29:57,467
Holy shit.

2021
02:30:00,534 --> 02:30:03,334
Francesca! Francesca, honey!

2022
02:30:22,567 --> 02:30:24,534
<i>10,000 block, Cielo Drive.</i>

2023
02:30:24,668 --> 02:30:27,867
Around what time was it
when you confronted the intruder?

2024
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:29,833
It was about midnight.

2025
02:30:29,967 --> 02:30:31,100
- Around midnight?
- Yeah.

2026
02:30:31,234 --> 02:30:32,800
How do you know
it was midnight?

2027
02:30:32,933 --> 02:30:36,167
Well, I was, uh...
I was in the kitchen.

2028
02:30:36,301 --> 02:30:39,501
You know, I was
making margaritas, and, uh...

2029
02:30:39,634 --> 02:30:41,334
I heard the sound
of a noisy muffler.

2030
02:30:41,467 --> 02:30:43,134
I looked up at the clock.

2031
02:30:43,267 --> 02:30:45,267
It said... The kitchen clock
said midnight.

2032
02:30:45,401 --> 02:30:46,933
Twelve o'clock exactly?

2033
02:30:47,067 --> 02:30:49,167
I mean,
it could have been 12:05.

2034
02:30:49,301 --> 02:30:51,634
- Something like that.
- And you didn't see them again

2035
02:30:51,768 --> 02:30:53,867
until the woman attacked you
in the pool.

2036
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,933
No, no.

2037
02:30:56,067 --> 02:30:58,134
So,
what did these perpetrators do?

2038
02:30:58,267 --> 02:31:00,800
Perpetrators?
They were hippie assholes.

2039
02:31:00,933 --> 02:31:04,367
Two of them burst through
the front door there,

2040
02:31:04,501 --> 02:31:08,800
and the guy hippie
said he was the devil.

2041
02:31:08,933 --> 02:31:11,634
And he said, "I'm here to...

2042
02:31:11,768 --> 02:31:13,867
do some devil shit."

2043
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,601
Or...
That's not verbatim, but...

2044
02:31:16,734 --> 02:31:19,501
- "Some devil shit"?
- Yeah, "devil shit."

2045
02:31:33,634 --> 02:31:35,668
And away we go.

2046
02:31:38,867 --> 02:31:41,000
Hey. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

2047
02:31:41,134 --> 02:31:42,734
What hospital you going to,
Cliff?

2048
02:31:42,867 --> 02:31:44,100
I'll meet you there, huh?

2049
02:31:44,234 --> 02:31:46,601
You don't want to meet me
in no hospital.

2050
02:31:46,734 --> 02:31:48,567
Why don't you go take care
of your lady.

2051
02:31:48,701 --> 02:31:51,567
Hey, she just took
five fucking sleeping pills.

2052
02:31:51,701 --> 02:31:53,467
She'll be asleep
till Columbus Day.

2053
02:31:53,601 --> 02:31:56,067
These guys will probably
have to come out here again

2054
02:31:56,200 --> 02:31:58,434
- just to wake her ass up.
- Hey, I'm not gonna die.

2055
02:31:58,567 --> 02:32:00,401
I may get a limp,
but I ain't gonna die.

2056
02:32:00,534 --> 02:32:02,467
- It's not my time yet, man.
- All right.

2057
02:32:02,601 --> 02:32:04,933
So no use waiting
in some waiting room.

2058
02:32:05,067 --> 02:32:08,134
Why don't you go lie naked
with that fine creature.

2059
02:32:08,267 --> 02:32:09,768
Come visit me tomorrow.

2060
02:32:09,900 --> 02:32:12,134
Bring bagels.

2061
02:32:12,267 --> 02:32:14,668
You want to do something for me,
check on Brandy.

2062
02:32:14,800 --> 02:32:16,601
She may be a little shook up
after that.

2063
02:32:16,734 --> 02:32:19,100
- She may want to sleep with you.
- Are you kidding me?

2064
02:32:19,234 --> 02:32:21,067
She's sleeping
with Francesca right now.

2065
02:32:21,200 --> 02:32:23,100
You might never get her back.
Ha, ha.

2066
02:32:23,234 --> 02:32:24,933
- We got to go.
- All right, then, Cliff.

2067
02:32:25,067 --> 02:32:27,434
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

2068
02:32:30,900 --> 02:32:32,367
Hey. Hey.

2069
02:32:36,334 --> 02:32:38,100
You're a good friend, Cliff.

2070
02:32:39,601 --> 02:32:40,768
I try.

2071
02:33:13,134 --> 02:33:14,034
Hello?

2072
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:16,867
Hey.

2073
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:18,034
I'm Jay Sebring.

2074
02:33:18,167 --> 02:33:20,200
I'm a friend of the Polanskis.

2075
02:33:20,334 --> 02:33:22,867
You're Rick Dalton,
right?

2076
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:26,534
Yeah. Yeah. I'm Rick Dalton.

2077
02:33:26,668 --> 02:33:28,467
- Live next door.
- Oh, I know.

2078
02:33:28,601 --> 02:33:31,234
I tease Sharon that she lives
next door to Jake Cahill.

2079
02:33:31,367 --> 02:33:33,334
If she ever wants to put
a bounty on Roman,

2080
02:33:33,467 --> 02:33:35,100
she just has to go next door,
right?

2081
02:33:36,933 --> 02:33:38,634
No shit.

2082
02:33:38,768 --> 02:33:41,100
What the fuck happened?

2083
02:33:41,234 --> 02:33:43,768
Oh, th-these fucking
hippie weirdos,

2084
02:33:43,900 --> 02:33:46,134
they-they-they
broke into my house.

2085
02:33:46,267 --> 02:33:48,900
What do you mean, like,
trying to rob you?

2086
02:33:49,034 --> 02:33:50,833
We don't know what the fuck
they wanted.

2087
02:33:50,967 --> 02:33:52,668
Were they robbing me?
I don't know.

2088
02:33:52,800 --> 02:33:54,933
Were they freaking out
on some bummer trip?

2089
02:33:55,067 --> 02:33:58,301
Who knows? But they tried
to kill my wife and my buddy.

2090
02:33:58,434 --> 02:34:01,800
- Jesus Christ. Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm fucking serious.

2091
02:34:01,933 --> 02:34:05,601
Now, my buddy and his dog
killed two of them, and then...

2092
02:34:05,734 --> 02:34:08,734
Well, shit.
I-I torched the last one.

2093
02:34:08,867 --> 02:34:10,601
- "Torched"?
- Yeah.

2094
02:34:10,734 --> 02:34:13,134
I burnt her ass to a crisp.

2095
02:34:13,267 --> 02:34:16,134
- How'd you do that?
- Well, believe it or not, I...

2096
02:34:16,267 --> 02:34:18,467
I got a flamethrower
in my toolshed.

2097
02:34:18,601 --> 02:34:21,100
Oh, from <i>The Fourteen Fists</i>
<i>of McCluskey.</i>

2098
02:34:21,234 --> 02:34:22,967
Yeah!

2099
02:34:23,100 --> 02:34:24,567
Yeah. Yeah.

2100
02:34:24,701 --> 02:34:26,234
That's... That's the one.

2101
02:34:26,367 --> 02:34:29,567
Yeah, it still works too.
Thank God.

2102
02:34:29,701 --> 02:34:31,000
Is everybody okay?

2103
02:34:31,134 --> 02:34:33,601
Well, the fucking hippies
aren't,

2104
02:34:33,734 --> 02:34:35,467
that's for goddamn sure.

2105
02:34:35,601 --> 02:34:37,134
Yeah. But I'm fine.

2106
02:34:37,267 --> 02:34:38,967
You know, my wife's fine.

2107
02:34:39,100 --> 02:34:41,800
We're just a little shook up,
is all.

2108
02:34:41,933 --> 02:34:45,367
- Oh, my God, that's terrifying.
- Yeah.

2109
02:34:45,501 --> 02:34:48,200
<i>Jay,
honey, is everything all right?</i>

2110
02:34:48,334 --> 02:34:50,301
Everything's okay now, honey.

2111
02:34:50,434 --> 02:34:53,167
But some hippies
broke into the house next door.

2112
02:34:53,301 --> 02:34:55,100
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

2113
02:34:55,234 --> 02:34:57,100
<i>Oh, that's terrifying.</i>

2114
02:34:57,234 --> 02:34:58,800
<i>Is everybody okay?</i>

2115
02:34:58,933 --> 02:35:02,800
I'm talking to your next-door
neighbor about it right now.

2116
02:35:02,933 --> 02:35:04,334
<i>Rick Dalton?</i>

2117
02:35:06,100 --> 02:35:08,467
Yeah, that's me. Heh.

2118
02:35:08,601 --> 02:35:10,967
<i>Oh. Well, hello, neighbor.</i>

2119
02:35:12,067 --> 02:35:13,800
<i>Is everybody okay?</i>

2120
02:35:13,933 --> 02:35:16,867
Yes, Sharon,
everybody's fine.

2121
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,134
<i>Are you okay?</i>

2122
02:35:20,668 --> 02:35:23,200
Well, yes, I am.
Thank you for asking that.

2123
02:35:23,334 --> 02:35:25,701
<i>Rick,
would you like to come up to the house</i>

2124
02:35:25,833 --> 02:35:28,301
<i>for a drink
and meet my other friends?</i>

2125
02:35:34,467 --> 02:35:37,601
Yeah, sure.
Thank you.

2126
02:35:37,734 --> 02:35:40,334
<i>Oh, hooray! Great.
I'll buzz you up.</i>

2127
02:35:52,034 --> 02:35:52,933
Come on.

2128
02:35:56,701 --> 02:35:58,833
- Hey, nice to meet you, huh?
- Yeah.

2129
02:35:58,967 --> 02:36:00,401
- Jay Sebring.
- Hey, pleasure.

2130
02:36:00,534 --> 02:36:01,567
- Yeah.
- Pleasure, Jay.

2131
02:36:01,701 --> 02:36:02,833
Pleasure's all mine.

2132
02:36:02,967 --> 02:36:04,768
Sounds like you had
a hell of a night.

2133

2134
02:39:23,567 --> 02:39:25,301
Hi. This is Rick Dalton,

2135
02:39:25,434 --> 02:39:27,967
better known as bounty hunter
Jake Cahill,

2136
02:39:28,100 --> 02:39:31,467
speaking on behalf
of Red Apple cigarettes.

2137
02:39:31,601 --> 02:39:34,701
Now, I smoke Red Apples.
Been smoking them for years.

2138
02:39:34,833 --> 02:39:37,167
But since the Red Apple
tobacco company's

2139
02:39:37,301 --> 02:39:39,768
been around since 1862,

2140
02:39:39,900 --> 02:39:43,100
<i>you'll see Jake Cahill
smoke Red Apple too.</i>

2141
02:39:43,234 --> 02:39:46,334
<i>Now, back in Jake's day,
Red Apple came in a pouch,</i>

2142
02:39:46,467 --> 02:39:48,301
<i>and he had to roll his own.</i>

2143
02:39:48,434 --> 02:39:51,334
But today, Red Apple
comes factory-rolled.

2144
02:39:51,467 --> 02:39:55,067
For the best drag
with the best tobacco flavor,

2145
02:39:55,200 --> 02:39:57,100
with less burn on your throat

2146
02:39:57,234 --> 02:39:59,668
than any other
non-filtered cigarette.

2147
02:40:06,034 --> 02:40:07,334
Mm!

2148
02:40:09,100 --> 02:40:11,634
Now, that's the way
a cigarette should taste.

2149
02:40:11,768 --> 02:40:12,634
Hm.

2150
02:40:12,768 --> 02:40:15,601
Better drag, more flavor,

2151
02:40:15,734 --> 02:40:17,134
less throat burn.

2152
02:40:19,534 --> 02:40:22,134
That's the Red Apple way.

2153
02:40:22,267 --> 02:40:25,933
So look for this life-size
standee of me, Jake Cahill,

2154
02:40:26,067 --> 02:40:29,634
wherever fine Red Apple tobacco
products are sold.

2155
02:40:29,768 --> 02:40:32,967
Take a bite
and feel all right.

2156
02:40:33,100 --> 02:40:36,401
Take a bite of
a Red Apple.

2157
02:40:36,534 --> 02:40:37,933
Tell them Jake sent you.

2158
02:40:41,067 --> 02:40:42,267
And cut.

2159
02:40:42,401 --> 02:40:44,200
This cigarette tastes like
fucking shit.

2160
02:40:44,334 --> 02:40:46,100
And, by the way,
who chose this photo?

2161
02:40:46,234 --> 02:40:47,668
I have a double chin.
All right?

2162
02:40:47,800 --> 02:40:49,100
Nobody notices that crap?

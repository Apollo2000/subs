1
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,017
- There's a category of people
that I work with

2
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:13,389
that are
infuriatingly talented...

3
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:22,565
that connect to an audience,
connect to what we do,

4
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,733
that value it,

5
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:26,235
being part of it
and caring about it.

6
00:00:29,155 --> 00:00:31,490
As long
as they're in this world,

7
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,910
I think you always recognize
whatever it is

8
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:36,120
when you see it.

9
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,289
You're always drawn to that.

10
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:43,878
- And... mark.

11
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,506
- It's actually Mike Myers,
all right, not Mark.

12
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,301
- How's everybody?
Good, good, good.

13
00:00:51,177 --> 00:00:52,386
- Any time you get to talk
about Chris Farley

14
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:53,763
is a good day, man.

15
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:55,973
- You want this somewhere?

16
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,642
- Everybody cries for this,
right?

17
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:04,355
- Don't give up.

18
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,441
- Yikes.

19
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,194
- Doo doo, on the right track.

20
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:12,615
- I haven't "had sex
with a woman."

21
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:14,408
- I "don't know how that works."

22
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:17,495
- Natural ability, like,
you can't even talk about it.

23
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,954
It's just natural.

24
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:22,124
- Lay off me, I'm starving!

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,628
- The funniest guy ever.
It was nuts. Nuts.

26
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:26,796
- Booyah!

27
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:29,632
- "Hello, Malibu!"

28
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,842
- I wanted my time with Chris.

29
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,303
- Well, maybe I'm not
"the norm."

30
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,848
I'm not "camera friendly."

31
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,683
- You know, when everybody's
deciding who's the funniest,

32
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:42,145
YOU 90,
"Farley is the funniest."

33
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:46,899
- You're from Wisconsin, right?

34
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,234
Madison, Wisconsin?
- Yes, sir.

35
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,985
- Beautiful state
and a very nice city.

36
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:51,570
Madison, I think,
is the capital of Wisconsin,

37
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:52,738
Fight?

38
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,615
- Yeah. [coughs]
- Yeah.

39
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,742
- Sorry about...
[grunts]

40
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:59,203
- [giggling]

41
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:09,630
- All right, put your hands
together for Kevin Farley!

42
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:10,798
Come on, baby!

43
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,675
[audience cheers]

44
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:14,969
- Hi, Madison.

45
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,221
Are you having fun?

46
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,890
It's Saturday night
in Mad-town...

47
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,100
Isn't that right?

48
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,185
I'm the one that looks
like Chris the most, right?

49
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:24,687
I look like Chris. Yeah.

50
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:25,812
[audience cheers]

51
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:26,856
- Ah-ow!

52
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:28,357
-[laughs] Ah-ow!

53
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:29,775
But it is kind of funny, though.

54
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,943
Like, I do look like Chris
a lot,

55
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,154
and so I go out of hotel rooms,

56
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:34,821
and this guy came...

57
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,657
I came out of the hotel
the other day,

58
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:39,118
and the guy goes,
"You're that guy,"

59
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:41,787
and I go, "Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I look like that guy,"

60
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:42,997
and he goes,
"Honey, get over here.

61
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:44,290
It's Chaz Bono."

62
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,375
[audience laughs]

63
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,255
I go, "Not that guy."

64
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,801
It was a lot of fun
growing up here,

65
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,179
just a lot of great memories,
you know.

66
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:01,807
You know, very peaceful,
and a simpler time, you know,

67
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:02,975
in the '70s.

68
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,936
There's the old haunt...

69
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,064
the house I grew up in.

70
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,150
But boy, when we lived here,
it was pretty simple.

71
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:12,318
We had a lot of fun
in that house,

72
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:13,777
I'll tell you that.

73
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,906
- [music] You came
into the world [music]

74
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,576
- Chris was the middle child,

75
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,077
the black sheep,

76
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:24,663
the strange one.

77
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,750
- He always wanted
to certainly outdo me

78
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,251
or show the younger two brothers

79
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,669
that, you know,
he was better than that.

80
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,421
He was just always... a game.

81
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,633
- It's like Americana
that everyone dreams

82
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,093
or thinks of in the 1960s.

83
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,261
We had it all.

84
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:42,139
What's ever
in everybody's imagination,

85
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:43,307
totally true.

86
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,059
Crazy, crazy, crazy-

87
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,685
- [music] Don't let nobody [music]

88
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:50,189
[music] Try to dampen your flame [music]

89
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,108
- The poor world only got to see

90
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:55,986
this part of the iceberg
that is Chris.

91
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,989
- We lived
in a very quiet little town,

92
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,158
Maple Bluff, little village.

93
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,868
We were outside a lot,
playing a lot.

94
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:06,163
You know, my mom would say
there was four boys and Barb.

95
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,748
If you were shooting hoops
in the backyard

96
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,041
and Morn came out,

97
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,960
and the four of us shouted,
"Mom, look at this. Look at me!

98
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,253
Mom! Look at me!"

99
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,547
You've got to say that
before every shot?

100
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,091
"Mommy, look at me"?

101
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,886
It's so clear-cut,
striving for attention.

102
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,972
- [music] 'Cause you were born
on fire [music]

103
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,515
[music] Da da da da
da da da [music]

104
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,347
[music] Da da da da [music]

105
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,310
- What kind of a life

106
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,192
did you and your folks
have when you were a kid?

107
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,357
- Oh, lord, Dave,
I put them through hell.

108
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,359
[audience laughs]

109
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,279
- My dad was a great guy.

110
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:40,322
He was a salesman,
just hilarious.

111
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,448
I mean, it wasn't a house

112
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,159
where, you know, Dad was strict
or anything like that,

113
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:46,245
and he'd get home
and watch the news,

114
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,997
and then,
you know, stir us all up

115
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,248
into some kind of frenzy,

116
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:50,374
and then
somebody would get hurt,

117
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,917
and then he'd go,
"All right, that's enough."

118
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,460
"You took it too far."

119
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,379
And he started the whole thing.

120
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,215
He liked to have the chaos,
I think, a lot of the times.

121
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,342
- Our family dinner table,
Chris had a presence.

122
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,345
He loved to be the entertainer,
for sure.

123
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,889
- There was a lot of competition
that way

124
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:07,933
on who could do
the funniest thing.

125
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,311
He usually won most of the time.

126
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:13,397
He just demanded it.

127
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:15,983
We were probably
in fourth grade,

128
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,027
and we had a bus
that went across town,

129
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,904
and he would sing,
"Jeremiah was a bullfrog."

130
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,865
[music] Jeremiah was a bullfrog [music]

131
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,784
And he had the whole bus
standing up, singing.

132
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,245
He took his shirt off for that,
on the school bus,

133
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,331
and just sang it in the front.

134
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:32,333
- I liked a girl
named Chris Bayer,

135
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,168
and so he'd be
in the back of the bus,

136
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:37,796
going, [music] Johnny Farley
loves Chris Bare-Naked! [music]

137
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,298
[music] Johnny Farley... [music]

138
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,966
He got the whole bus
to chant it,

139
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,927
and I was in the front,
going, "Oh, why?"

140
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,596
- In grade school,
at St. Patrick's,

141
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,264
my mom was in a semicircle

142
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,390
with a bunch of nuns around it,

143
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,808
and they were saying,

144
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,214
"You know,
the students at school

145
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,395
are laughing at Christopher,
not with him."

146
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,897
-[Letterman laughs]

147
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,022
- And then...

148
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,316
- When VHS came out, you know,

149
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,275
Dad was one of the first,
you know,

150
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,152
"Look at this new machine
I got,"

151
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,154
and we're, like,
taping stuff off the TV,

152
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,156
and we're watching it
over and over again.

153
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,367
We had just stockpiles
of everything.

154
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:09,370
And we watched Carol Burnett,
Jackie Gleason...

155
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:10,871
Gleason was king in our house...

156
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:14,583
the big comics, to us,
'cause they reminded us of Dad.

157
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:20,339
- It was just comedy, comedy,
comedy all the time.

158
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:24,051
- We would memorize comedy movies
start to finish,

159
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:28,389
and we used to, like, you know,
quiz each other on movie lines.

160
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:30,474
- Chris would find beats
in movies that we'd all watch,

161
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:31,892
that every one of us
would watch.

162
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,353
He'd find, like, characters
in the background, like...

163
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:35,854
"That fat kid's funny
in Meatballs.

164
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,356
I'm going to steal that bit."

165
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,858
And he would use it.
It was hilarious.

166
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,362
- This old country road
leads into a beautiful sanctuary

167
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:46,615
of nature's last outpost
against civilization,

168
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,326
and deep in the recesses
of the forest,

169
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:52,496
this indeed...
camp life.

170
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,339
- The Red Arrow camp
is a big part of our family

171
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,796
because all of us boys
went there

172
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,632
for seven weeks in the summer,

173
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,592
up in Minocqua,
in Woodruff, Wisconsin.

174
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:08,053
- Dad said,
"You're going up to camp."

175
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:12,516
Your riding, soccer, baseball,
swimming, sailing, skiing,

176
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,476
you know, we did it all,

177
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,520
but the really interesting thing
about camp

178
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,773
was at the end of the summer,
they did a camp play.

179
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:20,941
- We'd have auditions,

180
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,267
and then we'd see, like,
who would have the most talent,

181
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,112
just raw talent, as a kid,

182
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:26,947
and back then,
you didn't really know.

183
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:30,742
We had a play director,
a guy who wrote all the plays,

184
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,036
named Richard Wenzel.

185
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,746
- Chris had a lot of talent,

186
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:38,292
and I recognized the ability
for him to perform,

187
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,085
and I said, you know,

188
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:42,171
"There's somebody I'm going
to have to use on stage."

189
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,380
- There was the...

190
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,339
Chris performing, you know,
in the living room

191
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:46,508
in front of aunts and uncles
is one thing,

192
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:50,971
but this was, like, you know,
staged, directioned productions,

193
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,764
and Chris... took to it.

194
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:55,684
- Talent is something
you can't put your finger on.

195
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,894
It just happens,

196
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,061
and he had it.

197
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,440
- There was no theater
in our life at all

198
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:04,443
until Chris started, you know,
doing this stuff.

199
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:07,446
- He started to think,
"Wow, that's different."

200
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:10,532
"I'm different
than the other guys this way."

201
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,576
- It wasn't a pussy thing,
as he always said.

202
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,244
He said, "Oh,
I don't want to be in a play."

203
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,704
"That's for pussies."

204
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,164
Well, he was a pussy.

205
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:18,665
He really was a pussy,

206
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,833
and he did it,

207
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,407
and he could do it beautifully.

208
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:22,836
[laughs]

209
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,548
- Chris and I
went to Edgewood High School

210
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,008
in Madison, Wisconsin,

211
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,259
a Catholic school.

212
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:30,511
He lived for playing football.
He was nose guard,

213
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:34,223
and he just loved being
a part of the football team.

214
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,266
He always wanted to be
a part of the athletic crowd,

215
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,476
you know, the jocks,

216
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:38,435
and I would get, like,

217
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,230
the stories
that would come down, you know.

218
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:42,814
Like, "You're Chris's brother?"

219
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,359
"Are you going to, like,
pull your pants down?"

220
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:47,319
You know,
and I'd be like, "No."

221
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,988
"Oh, okay. Well, your brother
does that a lot."

222
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,449
- I brought my parents in
to get out of the trouble,

223
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,785
and said, like,
"They don't love me at home,"

224
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,662
and my dad's sitting there
in this counseling session,

225
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:59,665
going, "Yeah, uh-huh.
Yeah, we don't love him, yeah."

226
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,458
"The only kid in the family
with a 10-speed bike,"

227
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,709
"and we don't love him."

228
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:03,877
"Yeah. Yo."

229
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,153
So I thought
I'd got out of that jam

230
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:07,297
until we got in the parking lot

231
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,800
and he said, "Get in the car,
you prima donna!"

232
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:11,426
-[Letterman laughs]

233
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,554
- My dad would only get mad
at, like, little, small stuff,

234
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,014
like if you were late
for the car.

235
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,474
Then he'd just leave.

236
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,102
It was just... the big stuff
he was really cool about,

237
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,812
you know, like when...

238
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:25,440
Chris pulled his penis out
in typing class.

239
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,572
He was very cool about that.

240
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:33,699
- He was constantly
whipping out his dick.

241
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,661
- All the other football players
were in the typing class,

242
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,204
and one of the older guys said,

243
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,164
"Chris, we dare you
to unzip your fly"

244
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,624
"and start typing"

245
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,002
Of course, Chris did it.

246
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:46,461
You know, he never said no.

247
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,171
- The girl that saw him,

248
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,465
she was, like,
a born-again Christian,

249
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,218
and I don't think
she'd ever seen a penis before,

250
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,596
certainly not one
as small as his.

251
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:56,930
[laughs]

252
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,309
She freaked out.

253
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,881
- She's probably
still in therapy.

254
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:05,647
- The nun had to have
a conference call with my dad

255
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,232
about that, you know,

256
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,525
so he had to talk
to a Catholic nun

257
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,403
about how his son typed
with his penis.

258
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,531
He was very cool about it.

259
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,575
In fact, he laughed.

260
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,037
- He had to go.
He had to go.

261
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,122
So he went away
for one semester.

262
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,728
- He was like,
"Heh, heh, you know..."

263
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:24,791
"It was funny."

264
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,501
I don't know why.
Weird.

265
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,087
- He thought it was funny,
and it was.

266
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,714
It always got a laugh.

267
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,258
But that continued on
into adulthood,

268
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,885
which was a little strange.

269
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,471
- Did you go to college?

270
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,556
- Yeah, I went
to Marquette University.

271
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:40,891
- Oh, good school.
- Yeah.

272
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,809
- When you went to college,
what kind of a kid were you?

273
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,728
Was that... you probably were
a little more comfortable

274
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,480
being away from home then?

275
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:47,856
- Dave, the trouble continued.

276
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:52,986
[laughter]

277
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:57,115
- Oh, my god.

278
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,159
- Chris goes off to college,

279
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:00,702
and they don't have
a football team,

280
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,663
so he joins the rugby team,

281
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,665
and he's never played rugby
in his life.

282
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,541
- We met in a bar
called The Green Tree.

283
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,127
He couldn't have looked
more preppy if you...

284
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,046
I never even saw
anybody like that,

285
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,714
dressed in his pink Izod shirt

286
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,801
and those fucking khaki pants
and stupid shoes.

287
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,219
He was there to perform.

288
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,888
I think he may have spoken to me
with the end of his penis.

289
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,556
I can't quite remember,

290
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:22,683
but I believe
there was some discussion

291
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,685
when I spoke just to his penis.

292
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,644
We were a good team,

293
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,439
but we were also
an alcohol-fueled organization.

294
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,441
- He always wanted
to be part of a group, you know,

295
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,069
part of an ensemble,
part of a team.

296
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,821
You know, he loved it,

297
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:37,614
and he liked
to play his role in it.

298
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,701
- To make the "A" side
as a sophomore was a big deal.

299
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:43,745
Everybody on the team
took it really seriously.

300
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,581
They, you know, would jog
four miles to practice.

301
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:47,958
- Chris was a great athlete.

302
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,168
He'd dribble a basketball
between his legs,

303
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,295
but he wasn't in the best shape.

304
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,631
He had a specific build,
for sure,

305
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:58,260
and either you run with it,
or you run away from it.

306
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,597
- He really wanted
to impress upon the others

307
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,726
that were seniors and juniors
and really good athletes

308
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,571
that he was as good an athlete
as they were.

309
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:08,645
- There'd be a line out,

310
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,604
which is where, like,
five or six guys line up

311
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,648
and somebody throws the ball in,

312
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,650
and Chris would just
grab his shorts

313
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,235
and pull them all the way up

314
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,801
to what would be
a present-day thong,

315
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:18,062
you know, which was hilarious,

316
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,657
but you're kind of like,
"I don't think that's right."

317
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:21,908
- Right before
the ball comes in,

318
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,076
he'd go, "Hag"

319
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,953
like he was The Claw.

320
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:28,707
There's a certain level of fear
that he instills in people,

321
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:29,875
you know.

322
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,003
He has a frightening element
that I think is hilarious.

323
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,464
- It was almost like
an extended family to him

324
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:36,965
because everybody
was just loud and fun,

325
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,967
and he could be
the loudest and funnest.

326
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,012
- The cliche is,
it's a gentleman's sport

327
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:43,597
played by ruffians.

328
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,557
- There's three halves in rugby.

329
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,443
The first half,
the second half on the pitch,

330
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,686
and the third half in the party.

331
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,480
- We'd always say that,
you know, we may lose the game,

332
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,190
but we'll win the party,

333
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:54,775
and Chris
was a big part of that.

334
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,651
The other team would be drawn
to Chris immediately

335
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,362
because he was such a show
unto himself.

336
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,323
- We had fun, huh?
- Yeah!

337
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:04,493
- The girls would...

338
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,369
Some of them didn't like
some of the stunts

339
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:07,704
that Chris would pull.

340
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,831
If there was a couple girls
walking down the street

341
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,208
and you'd say,
"Oh, that girl's cute,"

342
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,584
he's like, "Hold my books,"

343
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,462
and he'd run, start jogging
in front of them,

344
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,047
you know, kicking up his legs.

345
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:18,340
- Hi. How are you?

346
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,717
- A pretty woman would be
walking by in Madison,

347
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:24,513
and he'd drop and do pushups
and just go, "198, 199,"

348
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,515
like... [laughs]

349
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:27,849
But he did it
with such commitment.

350
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:28,892
- And it always
kind of got a laugh,

351
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,393
like, "How are you
doing, ladies?"

352
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,559
He would do all these bits

353
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:32,842
in the hopes
that they'd be like,

354
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,105
"Mmm, you're funny."

355
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,149
- He had some girlfriends that
really liked him and saw...

356
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,108
and they had...

357
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,915
she had to have
a sense of humor, you know,

358
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:40,362
to go out with Chris.

359
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:44,282
- Well, she dumped me,
like they all did,

360
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,076
and, you know,
she was a nice gal.

361
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,870
I remember we used to have
nicknames for each other.

362
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,832
"My raven-haired one-eyed pixie
that stole America's heart,"

363
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:52,916
and things like that.
- That's cute.

364
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,251
And did she have a nickname
for yourself?

365
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,252
- She'd call me "Fatso..."

366
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,212
- [laughter]
- And it never...

367
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,380
- [chuckles]

368
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:00,882
- If we were hanging out with,
like, at a party,

369
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,844
with a keg with a bunch <i>of...</i>
everybody with a red cup,

370
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,804
and he'd go see a bunch of girls
talking to each other,

371
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,305
and he'd go roll in the mud
in front of them,

372
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,266
and then pop up and be like,

373
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,434
"You guys,
do you want to go out later?"

374
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,186
you know,
or say some stupid line.

375
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,479
"So what's your number?"

376
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,523
and just throwing the beer
all over himself

377
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:17,774
or just something...

378
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,901
- We're going to show this world
a thing or two.

379
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,611
We're going to show...

380
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,113
[Crash]

381
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,489
[laughter]

382
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,408
- Blacking out is, like...
"Did you black out last night?"

383
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:27,533
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."

384
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,786
Blackout City, motherfuckers!

385
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,913
Let's all black out tonight.

386
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:33,694
- We knew
we wanted to do comedy,

387
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,500
but had no idea
how to do it at all.

388
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,626
Now, Marquette
had this new thing

389
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:37,751
called the Follies,

390
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,796
where they had bands
and acts and magicians

391
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:40,881
and anybody who had a talent,

392
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:42,132
and they'd pack
the varsity theater

393
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,592
with 2,000 people,

394
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,052
and they'd have a variety show,
which is awesome.

395
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:49,764
So we said, "We should sign up
for the Follies."

396
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,266
"We've got, like, two minutes."

397
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,431
"What are we going to do?"

398
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,519
Chris takes my collar,
flicks it up.

399
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,062
He goes, "You're Cool Guy."

400
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:57,628
And I go,
"What are you going to be?"

401
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:58,773
Chris puts on
these kind of nerdy glasses,

402
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,734
and he goes, "I'll be Nerd Guy."

403
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,361
- I'm not supposed to be here.
Uh...

404
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,072
- I go out,
kind of get a few laughs,

405
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,197
give a silly little run.

406
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,701
Chris comes running out
full blast...

407
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,828
trips, slides, bowling ball,

408
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,539
knocks over his chair,
two other chairs.

409
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,207
The place is going berserk.

410
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,751
They're going crazy-

411
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:18,919
Lights go out.

412
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,795
And then
we're running backstage.

413
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,964
It felt like
our shirts were even, just,

414
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,841
were blowing
in the wind of the audience,

415
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,718
like, applause and laughter.

416
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,511
And Chris just stops,
and he turns to me

417
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:29,638
right at the edge of the curtain
backstage

418
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,264
and goes, "This is it."

419
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,852
"This is what we're going to do
for the rest of our lives."

420
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,021
- Did you hear
I finally graduated?

421
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,023
- Yeah, in just a shade
under a decade, too.

422
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,191
All right.

423
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,638
- You know, a lot of people
go to college for seven years.

424
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,195
- I know.
They're called doctors.

425
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,613
- Clearly, you know,

426
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,198
Dad realized
right from the start

427
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:49,824
that he was unemployable

428
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:50,909
and there was only one employer

429
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,395
that could possibly
give him a job,

430
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,620
and that was him.

431
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,538
One thing Dad realized
really quickly,

432
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:57,415
and which is easy to spot,

433
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,459
is the guy knew people.

434
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,544
- You just liked him right away,

435
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,005
and you'd buy anything
they had to sell.

436
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,171
- Hey, I'll tell you what.

437
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,841
You could take a good look
at a butcher's ass

438
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,218
by sticking your head up there,

439
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:11,137
but wouldn't you rather
take his word for it?

440
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,262
- What?

441
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,306
- They had an oil company

442
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,809
where they sold oil for pavement
and asphalt and things,

443
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:16,977
and did well,

444
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:19,354
and Chris goes,
"All I do is, um,"

445
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,898
"I take these guys out,
uh, to dinner..."

446
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:25,693
"uh, we just drink and eat,
and I don't pay for anything,"

447
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,070
"and then at the end, I go,"

448
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:30,448
" 'My dad wanted you guys
to sign this contract.' "

449
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,993
" 'Is that... can you do that?' "

450
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:34,661
"And they'd go, 'Sure, sure,' "

451
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,871
"and then my dad gave me money."

452
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,707
- Okay, I'll buy it from you.

453
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,000
- Well, that's...
- What?

454
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,210
- You could see why Chris's dad
was grooming him

455
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,376
to take over the business,

456
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:46,047
because it was obvious
that Chris could...

457
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,049
had that kind of effect
on people,

458
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,135
the kind of slapping people
on the back.

459
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,013
- Both Chris and I worked
for my dad's asphalt company,

460
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,889
Scotch Oil Company here in town.

461
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,433
Nobody heard of it?
Okay.

462
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:57,892
[audience laughs]

463
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,144
But asphalt's not too hard
to sell, folks,

464
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,854
because you either want it
or you don't.

465
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,313
[audience laughs]

466
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:05,150
- Chris's office
at Scotch Oil Company...

467
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,109
we would go in,

468
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,486
"Oh,
look at the little president."

469
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:09,611
We'd make fun of him.

470
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,239
We were, like, "Daddy,"
and, like,

471
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,949
"Let's see what you're working
on there, champ."

472
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,744
- [voice vibrating]
Luke... Luke...

473
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,370
I am your father.

474
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:20,331
- I'd open up his desk,

475
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:24,002
and it'd be, like Mad magazine,
Cracked magazine...

476
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,379
Where is anything
resembling work on this desk,

477
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:27,547
at all?

478
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:30,216
"What have you been doing?"
He goes, "What? Get out of here.

479
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:31,509
Get out of here."

480
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,888
- He was so encouraged
at Marquette to get onstage

481
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,140
and do something
in the drama field.

482
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:40,268
They had this little theater
called the Ark Improv Theater.

483
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,393
- There was always

484
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:44,230
a kind of nice little storefront
theater scene there.

485
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,734
Most of the theaters there
tend to be former garages

486
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:49,194
or future laundromats.

487
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,904
The director tends to be

488
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,615
the guy who goes out
and buys paper towels, you know.

489
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,866
- It's late, you know.

490
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,993
It's midnight, I don't know.

491
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,369
It was a long day,

492
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:01,164
and in walks
this big, giant guy,

493
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,044
with this big smile, staggering.

494
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,755
"Do you guys do classes?"

495
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:10,215
[laughs]

496
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,759
And I said,
"Yeah, yeah, we do classes."

497
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,844
"My wife has a class
tomorrow morning,"

498
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,013
"Saturday morning at 10:00.
Here."

499
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,641
He reached out
and grabbed my hand,

500
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,018
and he shook it, like, "Ouch!"

501
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,145
Like I saved his life.
"Thank you, man!"

502
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,688
[hyperventilates]

503
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,982
So the next morning, I wake up,

504
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,693
and my wife calls me
from the theater

505
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,279
and <i>says,</i>
"Did you invite some guy

506
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,698
to come and take my class
this morning?"

507
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:36,866
I said, "Oh!"

508
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,702
"Yeah, I did, but I, I, I,"

509
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,748
"I didn't think
he would ever show up,"

510
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,154
and she says, "Well, he's here,"

511
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,459
"and he brought
a case of beer."

512
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:47,627
[laughs]

513
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,171
- Hi there.

514
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,383
Officer Fred McGuire,
local one-niner-niner.

515
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,969
- Kind of jaw-dropping at times
to watch Chris work,

516
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:58,346
even on a local little stage
like the Ark.

517
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,808
The power of his talent was,
even in a raw state,

518
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,769
was so undeniable.

519
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,938
-[mumbles as the Godfather]

520
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,357
- He just had such presence
and charisma.

521
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:13,903
- Chris had this amazing talent,
this perfect storm of comedy.

522
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,321
Boom!
Obvious.

523
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,741
- My love, you ate
the liverwurst!

524
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:20,326
- I was hungry.

525
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:24,289
- He found this art form
where you work in an ensemble,

526
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,624
and, you know,
you work off each other,

527
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:27,959
and there's no denial.

528
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,003
It's all about acceptance.

529
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,796
- I do remember
going every weekend

530
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,047
and laughing my head off.

531
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,632
I mean, I wouldn't miss it.
It was the best.

532
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:35,958
- The shows were really weird.

533
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,219
The shows were, like, bizarre.

534
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,180
I didn't even get any of them.

535
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:42,140
Chris would come out
<i>as</i> Elvis, Fat Elvis.

536
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:45,351
"Well, bless my soul,
what's wrong with me?

537
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,811
I think I shit my pants."

538
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,146
- And then
he'd keel over on stage,

539
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,564
and the lights would go out.

540
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,607
-[imitates curtain falling]

541
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,734
"Okay, what did we just watch?"

542
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,327
- See, the thing about Chris
is his heart,

543
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,455
this really kind, gentle,

544
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,790
childish, innocent heart,

545
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,462
which, I say,
was the perfect storm,

546
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:15,256
because
in that kind and gentle heart

547
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,761
was also
a very frightened person.

548
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:22,722
I was sad to see him go

549
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,642
because I thought
it was too soon.

550
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,853
He was just beginning improv
and coming into a craft,

551
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:33,399
as opposed to a party guy,
a party trick.

552
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:41,032
- Chris comes down to Chicago,
and we hook up.

553
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,118
We know Second City's the mecca.
That's the place.

554
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,761
We don't know what to do
or where to go,

555
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,288
but we've gotta
do this together.

556
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,124
We're just pacing
in front of Second City,

557
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,293
and I swear both of us
kind of thought

558
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,878
that on the second
or third floor

559
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,171
of the Second City offices,

560
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,017
somebody was going to look down
and be like,

561
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,967
"Well, then we just need
two more people,"

562
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,343
"or we're not going
to have a show tonight."

563
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:02,428
"Hey, those two fellows
look pretty funny."

564
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,888
As if you're going
to walk around Wrigley Field

565
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,056
and have, "Hey!"
[creaking]

566
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,808
"Come on in.
Play some ball."

567
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,478
- He called to tell me,

568
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,355
"I got into the classes
at Second City,"

569
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,691
and I was like,
"Wow, that's awesome!"

570
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,151
- He was far more ambitious
than I ever thought.

571
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,529
I didn't know
that he would pursue training

572
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,406
and end up with Del Close,

573
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:24,284
king shit
of improvisational acting.

574
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,243
- I wanted to really show

575
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,328
that we could create art
by committee.

576
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,372
Nothing that I hear
is going to be simple.

577
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,249
Nothing that you say to me

578
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,376
is going to be accepted
at face value.

579
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,461
It always means something else.

580
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,880
- Del Close
was a fantastic improviser,

581
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,090
great teacher.

582
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,299
He didn't teach comedy,

583
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:41,904
because I don't think
that's teachable,

584
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,386
but he taught creativity.

585
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,596
Del was the creative Svengali

586
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,391
of Bill Murray,
Belushi, Aykroyd.

587
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,062
- Del was the chief
anarchist artist there.

588
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,773
What he taught all of us
was to be free

589
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,567
and to be unafraid

590
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,987
and to go out and fail
as often as possible,

591
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,197
to try things, to die onstage.

592
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,825
He threw off convention

593
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,391
and kind of blew the lid
off the form

594
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,704
so that we could really
do the freest work,

595
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,748
um, that we were capable of.

596
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,791
- Okay, do it.

597
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,505
And that's the lighting we have?

598
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,673
Okay.

599
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,425
- We realize perfectly well

600
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,951
that all the characters
that we play

601
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,304
are really subsets of ourselves,

602
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:30,391
they're just ourselves
in slightly different moods,

603
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:34,187
ourselves carrying
a little more emotional freight.

604
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:35,897
- Del said, "Mr. Myers,"

605
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:39,942
"there's somebody who I think
is a kindred spirit"

606
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,444
"that you have to meet."

607
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,321
"You have to meet Farley."

608
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,573
So I met him.

609
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,325
The second I saw him,

610
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,285
I thought he was going
to be a giant star.

611
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,704
- If he had just been
a big, funny guy that fell down,

612
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:54,374
Del Close certainly never would
have cast him at Second City.

613
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:55,958
Del Close
would have washed him out

614
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:57,126
right away.

615
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,384
He had no time for people
that were just funny,

616
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:02,340
and if someone sold out a scene
for a joke,

617
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,342
Del would sometimes
just throw them offstage.

618
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,427
He's like, "Get the hell
out of here, you turkey."

619
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:09,889
Dell wanted to work with Chris
because he was funny and honest.

620
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:11,099
- The smallest,

621
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,686
the teeniest, weeniest
emotional discovery that's real

622
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:17,354
beats the hell

623
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,982
out of the biggest one
that's phony,

624
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:21,442
and that's why our audience,
I think,

625
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,069
is so much on our side,

626
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:25,559
because they want us to succeed.

627
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:28,324
They have this...
They're cheering us on.

628
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:31,244
- "To treat the audience
like poets and kings,

629
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,162
and they'll respond in kind."

630
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,455
I've always felt that way,

631
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,958
and I saw it completely embodied
in Chris Farley.

632
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,334
- Del loved Chris,

633
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,128
so it's no surprise to me

634
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:43,339
that Del plucked him
for the mainstage cast

635
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:45,133
almost immediately.

636
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:46,300
- Hello there.

637
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:49,543
This must be the birthday girl.

638
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,513
- That's right.

639
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,640
- Hi, birthday girl.
Doogie Howser.

640
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,100
[audience laughs]

641
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,229
Well, I guess, then,
little birthday girl,

642
00:23:58,354 --> 00:23:59,689
this one's for you.

643
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:04,402
[music]

644
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:13,453
- For Chris, I think
Del was the Lamaze birth coach

645
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:14,912
that kind of pulled

646
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:18,666
all of everything
that was inside of Chris out.

647
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:20,960
- He said the same thing to Chris
that he said to Belushi,

648
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:24,046
which is "Go out there,
attack the stage like a bull."

649
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:25,381
"You have that kind of power."

650
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,467
"Just try to kill them
with laughter."

651
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:28,592
"Just kill them."

652
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,845
- Chris on stage was crazy,
force of nature,

653
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,138
through the roof,

654
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:37,685
quantitatively, qualitatively
amped up past everybody else.

655
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:42,482
- His basic impulse
is to make situations funny.

656
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:44,734
He was taught
"Don't stifle that."

657
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:45,902
"Expand on it."

658
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,404
He found his identity with that,

659
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:51,365
because that was
his natural impulse as a kid.

660
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,451
- It was really that feeling
of, like, "I get it."

661
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:54,702
"I'm only going
to watch that guy"

662
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:55,995
"if he's onstage,"

663
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,890
"because there's nothing
touching him."

664
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:00,541
"He is wildly entertaining."

665
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:03,961
- I improvised
with Chris Farley,

666
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,630
and I was scared to death

667
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:07,507
because he had already
knocked somebody's tooth out

668
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:09,592
and gave somebody else a scar

669
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:11,469
from just being so crazy,

670
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:13,596
and I'm...
I mean, I have a lot of energy,

671
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:14,680
but I don't have that energy.

672
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:15,848
- Jesus...

673
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:19,769
right before he'd go on stage,
he'd drop his pants,

674
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:22,730
and just pull them up
at the last second.

675
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:24,391
So you're standing behind him

676
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:27,068
because
if you have to go out next...

677
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,611
you get that view.

678
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,988
- It was
a very beer-soaked culture

679
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,657
in the improv world, you know.

680
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:34,283
We all drank too much.

681
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:37,620
Parties usually involved
way too much beer drinking.

682
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:40,623
- One time he showed up,
he was pretty well lit up.

683
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,334
I was like,
"My god, you can barely talk.

684
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:44,418
Are you all right to go on?"

685
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:46,587
I go,
"You shouldn't go on stage."

686
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,423
Went on stage,
was crystal clear as a bell.

687
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:51,259
Made everyone laugh, hilarious.

688
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:52,635
Went back to the back stage,

689
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,679
it was like,
[slurring] "Oh, my god."

690
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:56,931
I'm like, "How the hell
did you just do that?"

691
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,684
- But he did push it.
He did push it, as John did.

692
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:03,020
He had automatic charisma
like John, you know.

693
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,814
He was a light, you know.

694
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:07,442
Heads would turn
when he came into the room.

695
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:09,569
- Chris loved and idolized
Belushi,

696
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:11,654
but he never imitated Belushi,

697
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:12,779
in the same way

698
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,991
that a Keith Richards
might emulate

699
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:16,534
his old blues heroes

700
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,579
but never really
sound like them.

701
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:24,584
He took what he loved about them
and made it his own.

702
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,381
- I got hired
for Saturday Night Live,

703
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:32,675
and they said to me, you know,

704
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,969
"Who do you think
is good there?"

705
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,263
I listed a whole bunch of names,

706
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:40,057
but the first name I said
was Chris Farley.

707
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,268
- Come on.
It was undeniable.

708
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:44,478
You couldn't stop Chris.

709
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:47,773
He leaped over everyone,
and he should have.

710
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:49,358
- Everybody recognized it

711
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:51,902
even if they resented it
a little.

712
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:53,654
You know, it was very clear.

713
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,656
"Yeah, of course, you know."

714
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,533
- All righty, everybody.

715
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,536
- He was one of the people
we'd heard about,

716
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:03,998
and you could tell
how much he loved to perform.

717
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:08,294
This incredible sort of
generosity of spirit,

718
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:11,088
and also just
a kind of innocence.

719
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,508
I used to say
that he was the child

720
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:17,470
that Dan Aykroyd
and John Belushi didn't have.

721
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:20,264
There was just a joy
in what he was doing.

722
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,599
You were always drawn to him.

723
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:23,225
I knew I was bringing him
to New York.

724
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:24,471
- It's a whale.
- It's a boy.

725
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:25,728
- It's a whale boy.

726
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,188
[applause]

727
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,237
- It was a sad going-away,
a little bit.

728
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:36,363
We were happy for him,

729
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:37,531
but we were
also a little nervous...

730
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:39,659
like, this poor little kid
from Madison

731
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:43,537
going to go to New York City,
which he'd never been to,

732
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:45,164
and be on a big TV show.

733
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:48,000
It's kind of a lot for him,
and it was a lot for him.

734
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,877
He was scared.

735
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:59,095
- Five, four, three,
two, one, go.

736
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:02,223
Live from New York,
it's Saturday Night!

737
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:03,724
- Oh, one more thing.

738
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,434
Live from New York,
it's Saturday Night!

739
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:06,602
[audience cheers]

740
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:09,689
- It's so intense
that it's a joke, you know.

741
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:11,148
By the time you get off of it,

742
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,192
you're like,
"How did I survive that?

743
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:14,485
That's not possible."

744
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,321
- There's nothing
like the live performance.

745
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,449
It is the most exhilarating,
exciting...

746
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:23,661
It's, like,
heart-pounding pressure.

747
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:25,621
- You know, Dana Carvey says

748
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,706
it's like being shot
out of a cannon without a net

749
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:28,541
once a week.

750
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:29,750
- "Chris Farley!"

751
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,335
"Yeah, that's right.
Chris is here.

752
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,741
We're going to see Chris Farley
live in this tiny studio."

753
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:36,424
You'd hear that applause
go up more.

754
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,426
- He was powerful on stage.

755
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:41,303
I think one of the problems
he first had

756
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:42,680
when he came to the show,
I think,

757
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:45,433
was he was still playing
to the back row,

758
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:48,561
and the fact that the camera's
sort of here

759
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,730
took a little while
to adjust to.

760
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:51,856
He always played big,

761
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:54,608
but he learned
how to play big for camera.

762
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:56,819
- The week Patrick Swayze
hosted, he called me.

763
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:57,987
He's like,

764
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,989
"Lorne and everybody
wants me to be the fat guy,"

765
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:03,617
"and they want me to dress
to do a sketch from, uh..."

766
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:06,162
"where I'm stripping
from Chippendales"

767
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:07,413
"with Patrick Swayze,"

768
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:08,789
"and they want me
to take my shirt off,"

769
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,416
"and then I'm the fat guy."

770
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:11,751
"What do you think?"

771
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:12,835
"I mean, it's just embarrassing,
you know."

772
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,462
It's like,
"Well, if you do that"

773
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:17,214
"and you are
the funniest fat guy ever,"

774
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:18,924
"then you should do it."

775
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:29,602
- I'm sure he had reservations
about going out there full-on,

776
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:30,770
but he saw...

777
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,981
"This is my mission.
This is full-on comic value."

778
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,649
"It's a perfect use
of my physicality."

779
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,777
"Yes, I will do it."

780
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,864
- And there's a lot of girth
going with it

781
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:43,699
and not-give-a-shit pride,

782
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,326
and "This is my body."

783
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:47,912
He's not thinking it.
He's there.

784
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:51,624
- Like, I feel really lucky
that I was in high school

785
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:54,043
when Chris Farley
was on Saturday Night Live.

786
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:55,836
That was definitely
one of those things

787
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,171
that all the all the kids
around the schoolyard

788
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,048
were like, "Did you see that?"

789
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:00,424
"Like, that was..."

790
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,760
"that was out of control."

791
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,763
Even just, like, as a fat kid,
it's like "Oh, he's my hero."

792
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,098
Like, he took his shirt off
on national TV,

793
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:11,477
and he's as good a dancer
as Patrick Swayze is.

794
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,396
The fact that you've got

795
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:17,525
the late Jan Hooks
and Kevin Nealon and Mike Myers

796
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,485
sitting there,
like, watching, as the...

797
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,653
If they laugh.

798
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:23,656
The sketch goes poof, goes away.

799
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:24,824
- I'm doing...

800
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:26,491
this.

801
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:27,743
I'm doing a lot of this.

802
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,745
If you kind of look
at my face in the sketch,

803
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,704
it's a little like a dog

804
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,456
that's hearing
a weird frequency.

805
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:35,334
It was like, "What is that?"

806
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:43,801
[audience cheers]

807
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,847
- Thank you, Adrian, Barney.

808
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:49,765
If you could just
give us a minute,

809
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,976
we'll have our decision.

810
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:58,357
- Oh...

811
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:01,944
- Adrian... you were great
out there, man.

812
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,821
<i>I know... it's</i> going <i>to be you.</i>

813
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:05,739
- Oh, what are you talking about,
Barney?

814
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:07,950
You've got it, and you know it.

815
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:10,744
- Whatever happens,
you're the best.

816
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:13,581
- Buddies?

817
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,039
- Buddies.

818
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:16,959
- They're ready for you guys.

819
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:19,545
- And then you've got
the thing at the end

820
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,796
where they actually say,
"Well, no.

821
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:23,841
We're going to go with,"
you know, "with this guy.

822
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:27,803
He's got a better body,
and he's a much better dancer."

823
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,973
Who did Farley beat out,
then, to get... what?

824
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:33,058
Yeah, okay, yeah.

825
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,730
- On the one hand,
Chris was acting

826
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:39,857
like he was embarrassed
about playing the fat guy,

827
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:41,984
but on the other hand,
he fucking loved it,

828
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,111
and that's the contradiction
he was.

829
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,757
- After the Chippendales,
we were like,

830
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,240
"Oh,
this guy's going to be giant.

831
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,950
He's going to be a huge star."

832
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,244
But I knew that back in Chicago.

833
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:54,079
- You know, growing up,

834
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,956
you think that showbiz people
come from outer space

835
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,081
or something.

836
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:59,418
You don't expect to know anybody
who's doing this,

837
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:00,711
and to just watch

838
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:05,132
someone you've watched
in improv basements,

839
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,676
you know, on the biggest
comedy stage in the world,

840
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,303
was just so exciting.

841
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:12,306
- Just to see him on TV
was crazy,

842
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,016
and the family
would all gather around

843
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:15,225
and go,
"Oh, my god, look at this."

844
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:17,269
"He's on TV."

845
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:21,857
- We had seen Chris's sketch,
the Chippendales sketch,

846
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,609
and went,
"We have to sign that guy,"

847
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:25,027
and he sort of just sat there,

848
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:26,913
and he would nod a lot,
and then he would go,

849
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,948
"Uh, uh, uh...
Could I be with you guys?"

850
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:30,240
and we were like,

851
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:31,784
"No, it's supposed to be
the other way around.

852
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:33,661
We're supposed
to be pitching you."

853
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,245
- He was incredibly friendly
immediately.

854
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:38,040
He didn't see it as,
"Oh, here comes the new guy,"

855
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,165
or "Oh, good,"

856
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:40,626
"I've got more competition
on the show, bubba."

857
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,419
He was just more like,
"Hey," like,

858
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,171
"Fellow comedian, here we go."

859
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:47,007
- First day, and I see Farley
in the lobby,

860
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,884
and he goes "How are you?
Chris Farley."

861
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,844
"Gallagher Tent and Awning."

862
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,680
Flips his hair around, and...

863
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:55,015
which I grew to know
over the years,

864
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,352
that was his standard
deep voice, handshake, meet guy.

865
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:01,271
- The truth is that everybody
that gets the show

866
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:03,565
usually are unknown and broke.

867
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:06,652
Suddenly, you know,
you're living your dream life.

868
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:07,977
I mean, I always say to Lorne,

869
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:09,488
"Thanks for giving me
the life I dreamed of,"

870
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,949
and that's what you get
if you succeed on that show.

871
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:13,951
- We were both getting famous,

872
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:17,830
and literally, when I would walk
down the street with him,

873
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:20,624
it was no one else seen
except Farley.

874
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,007
It was just "Oh, my god,
there's Chris Farley."

875
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:24,086
"There's Chris Farley.
There's Chris Farley."

876
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,922
When I walked through Chicago
with him, my god.

877
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:28,090
- Da Bears.

878
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:32,052
- Welcome to another edition
of Bill Swerski's Superfans.

879
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,178
- [burps]

880
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:34,346
That was me.

881
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:36,974
- Very nice.
All right.

882
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:39,852
- He was 100% believable
playing the biggest character.

883
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:41,478
You always were like,

884
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:45,107
"Yeah, I believe this guy.
I believe this guy's real."

885
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:47,026
- Everything okay?

886
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,902
-[grunts]

887
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,319
No problem.

888
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:51,947
Just having a heart attack.

889
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:52,990
- He'd be pounding his chest,
you know,

890
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:54,450
having a heart attack
in a hula skirt,

891
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:56,785
and you're like, "Yeah,
that could be a real guy."

892
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,162
- By the way, I should mention

893
00:33:58,287 --> 00:33:59,997
that Todd was kind enough
to show up today

894
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:03,000
even though earlier this week,
he had yet another heart attack.

895
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,334
- Yeah, well, the doc says

896
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,046
that I've got a small piece
of Polish sausage

897
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:09,089
lodged
in the lining of my heart.

898
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,424
- One of the funniest lines to me
was, like,

899
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:11,633
"How many is that, Todd?"

900
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:12,968
- Very nice recovery.

901
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:14,636
Now, how many heart attacks
is that for you, Todd?

902
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:16,930
- That makes a baker's dozen
for me.

903
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:18,891
- He didn't do a ton of prep.

904
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:20,142
He just goes, "Yeah, yeah,
we'll figure it out,"

905
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:23,145
and there's just only X amount
you can be taught,

906
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,022
and then there's a guy
that, like that walks in.

907
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:27,441
You go, "Oh, <i>he...</i>
he skips it all,"

908
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:28,566
and it works.

909
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,735
- Da... Bulls...

910
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:31,589
da Bulls, da Bulls,
da Bulls, da Bulls,

911
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:32,863
da Bulls...
- Yeah.

912
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,268
- Da Bulls, da Bulls,
da Bulls...

913
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:36,950
- Very good.

914
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:38,368
- Because everyone can fall down
and whatever,

915
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:39,369
but you can't do it that good.

916
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:43,165
He doesn't put his hands up,
which is what I would do.

917
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,877
So he doesn't block his fall,
and that's...

918
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,170
You can't do those forever.

919
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:49,797
I think Chevy Chase warned him
not to do that.

920
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:51,673
- Because Chevy'd always had
something there

921
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:53,133
just before he fell

922
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:55,928
that he could hit
that broke the fall,

923
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:58,472
but Chris was just taking it
as paid.

924
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,224
- Da Bulls, da Bulls, da Bulls.

925
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:01,975
- He wasn't paying
close enough attention

926
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:04,019
to see that there was
a way you could do it

927
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:05,312
and not hurt yourself.

928
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,272
His commitment was total.

929
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:08,649
- Chris, if I happened
to be in the building

930
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:09,650
and he happened to be
in the building,

931
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:10,775
would knock on the door

932
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,027
and go, "Michael!"

933
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:14,530
"You're such a good writer."

934
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:15,739
"What are you writing?"

935
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,033
and I'd be like,
"I'm writing a Sprockets."

936
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:19,827
He goes, "Can I be in it?"

937
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,329
Like this, just completely...

938
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,374
And I'd go, "I don't know.
Sure. I don't know."

939
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:27,209
"Can you do a German accent?"

940
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:29,253
"No, no, I can't.
I can't!"

941
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:32,589
And then he'd just...
"I can't!"

942
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:35,259
- He's not going
to be the idea man,

943
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:38,387
but he's going
to take any idea you bring in

944
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,847
and make it better.

945
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,265
- I know
he didn't write for himself,

946
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,683
because a lot of those guys
wrote for themselves,

947
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:43,892
the smart ones,

948
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,384
and they created these things,

949
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,104
and he kind of was at the mercy
of other people.

950
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:50,190
- I think he was very intimidated
by the writers.

951
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:51,358
I don't think he felt

952
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,164
like he could contribute
in sketch writing,

953
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:55,437
but of course he could,
because he had great instincts,

954
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:58,240
and he could put himself
into a character's mindset,

955
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:01,285
and he could improvise
lines and moments

956
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:03,370
by just doing the character.

957
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:04,496
- All you've got to do

958
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,039
is kind of hold on to Chris
like a ski lift, you know?

959
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:07,416
He'll lift you up the hill.

960
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:09,251
And so you would give him
a sketch and go,

961
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,576
"How would you make that funny
if you said it your way?"

962
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:12,869
or whatever, and honest to god,

963
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,683
he would destroy it
with how he would do it.

964
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:17,134
- When we would have
a hundred people

965
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:18,760
in the read-through,

966
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:21,388
it was a hundred people
pulling for Farley.

967
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:24,141
He was the easiest guy
to write for, for sure.

968
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:27,186
- He did try to write one sketch
because he never wrote sketches,

969
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:29,646
and it was called
"Puppy Lawyer,"

970
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,481
and it was about 14 pages,

971
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:33,208
and it was horrible,
and it was too long,

972
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:35,110
and at the read-through,
it was dying,

973
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:36,236
and just...

974
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:37,863
and then I kept looking
at the read-through,

975
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:40,324
going. "Ch, my god.
It's dying."

976
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:41,783
[whistling sound]

977
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:42,951
[explosion]

978
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:44,745
Bomb.

979
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:47,289
Then he grabs really hard
when he gets nervous.

980
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:49,291
"David,
I'm going to get in trouble,"

981
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,752
and then after that,
I would say,

982
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,337
"I'm working
on Puppy Lawyer."

983
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:55,047
"Your honor, arf arf."

984
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:57,758
- I think
you see the purest Chris,

985
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:01,136
um, when we did
the Chris Farley Show.

986
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,890
You see the timidness.
You see the awkwardness.

987
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:08,223
Somebody didn't write
the character of Chris Farley.

988
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:09,811
That was Chris Farley.

989
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:12,105
- It's almost
an impersonator's ability

990
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:15,317
to pick up on the way the person
talks about themselves

991
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:16,693
or sees the world,

992
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:19,321
and heighten it a little bit,

993
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,949
and that was Chris right there.

994
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:23,659
The Chris Farley Show.

995
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:25,244
That's how he felt
about the world.

996
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:27,454
- Welcome
to The Chris Farley Show.

997
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,830
I'm Chris Farley.

998
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,291
- Most regular people relate

999
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,752
to that
being a little star-struck,

1000
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:35,278
and even
when he was a star himself,

1001
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:38,882
I don't think he ever stopped
being kind of awestruck

1002
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,259
by celebrities he admired.

1003
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:44,221
- My guest tonight is
one of the greatest musicians...

1004
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,057
uh, rock musicians...

1005
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:51,019
I guess, songwriter... ever.

1006
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:55,732
- "You're Paul McCartney."
"Yes."

1007
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,776
"And you were the Beatles."

1008
00:37:58,735 --> 00:37:59,778
"Yes."

1009
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,447
- Remember when you were
with the Beatles?

1010
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:03,907
[audience laughs]

1011
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,742
[applause]

1012
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:06,994
- Sure. Sure.

1013
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:10,163
- That was awesome.

1014
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:11,832
[audience laughs]

1015
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,501
- Yeah, it was.
Yeah.

1016
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:18,422
- That was a magnified version
of himself,

1017
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,382
of his own insecurities,

1018
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:21,925
and you knew when
he was doing those interviews

1019
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,136
that was the arc of the sketch,

1020
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:26,847
was we wait
for his falling apart,

1021
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,807
because he was "so stupid!"

1022
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,476
"Damn it.
Why did I say that?"

1023
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:34,396
- So stupid.

1024
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:35,981
What a dumb question.

1025
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:37,149
- No, no, no.

1026
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,483
Chris, I get asked that
all the time in interviews.

1027
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:42,237
- Awkwardly, like,
"I know, I'm an idiot,"

1028
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,448
and "Oh, it's so great,
what you do,"

1029
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:47,075
and he kind of felt that way
about almost anybody.

1030
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,369
- His self-deprecating manner

1031
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:51,727
was another part
of the vulnerability

1032
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,374
that he put in
a lot of the things that he did.

1033
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,251
- "And in the end,
the love you take

1034
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,462
is equal to the love you make."

1035
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:00,464
You remember that?

1036
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,341
[audience laughs]

1037
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:03,675
- Yes.

1038
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:06,720
- Is that true?

1039
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,180
[audience laughs]

1040
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:11,058
- All that love
that came out of the guy

1041
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:14,561
was him just apologizing
by nature

1042
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:18,815
for a lot of stuff that <i>he...</i>

1043
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:23,820
I wish he'd never
had to apologize for.

1044
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:24,988
[applause]

1045
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:27,991
- Yes, Chris,
in my experience, it is.

1046
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:31,036
I find the more you give,
the more you get.

1047
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,913
- Oh...

1048
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,791
Awesome!

1049
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,546
- All the stars that would come
on the show,

1050
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,423
on Saturday Night Live,
the hosts,

1051
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,967
they would just, out loud,
just go, "I love you."

1052
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:47,260
"You're the best."

1053
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,346
"I watch the show
because of you," you know.

1054
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:51,264
We'd all be, like,
"That's funny, man.

1055
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,808
They all love Farley."

1056
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:55,310
- When Christian Slater came,
he had his hair greased back.

1057
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,354
He goes,
"Christian Slater's cool,"

1058
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:59,481
which he said
about every single host.

1059
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:01,316
He started
combing his hair back,

1060
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:02,859
and I go, "Oh, no, no."

1061
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,196
"Is it Single White Female?"

1062
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,156
He goes, "It's cool, man."

1063
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:09,825
- Every host was like,

1064
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,535
"Please put me in a skit
with that guy."

1065
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,995
They just loved being around
that energy.

1066
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:16,164
- He was sort of nervous
outward,

1067
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,542
so he would try
to show off a lot,

1068
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:20,919
try to be funny all the time,

1069
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:22,504
and that was his way
of flirting.

1070
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:24,089
I remember he was walking
around with a Diet Coke,

1071
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:26,049
and I think Glenn Close
was there, talking,

1072
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,300
and I could see him looking,

1073
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:28,986
and she goes, "Well,
talk to you later."

1074
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:29,928
He goes, "Yeah, okay,"
and he goes...

1075
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:31,053
[glugging sounds]

1076
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,889
And he chugged the whole Diet...

1077
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,349
and she goes, "Okay."

1078
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,101
She walked away, and I go,

1079
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:37,602
"Was that...
Are you showing off?"

1080
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,604
and he goes, "Yeah,
I chugged the whole thing."

1081
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:41,231
I go, "And who cares?"

1082
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:44,234
and he's like, "Shut up, dude."

1083
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:47,612
- That was, like,
his Achilles' heel, you know.

1084
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,239
Any time
you were in front of a girl,

1085
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:50,449
he was very bashful.

1086
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:52,868
- Chris was very attractive
to women, very attractive,

1087
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:56,121
and had some of the most
beautiful women in Hollywood

1088
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:57,831
would come by the set
to visit him

1089
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,416
because he was nice to people.

1090
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:01,293
He was nice to everybody.

1091
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,421
He was funny, he was sweet,
and he was a gentleman.

1092
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:07,424
- It starts with
that genuine expression,

1093
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:10,635
that sincerity here,
that was so attractive,

1094
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,429
and then his power
and his strength.

1095
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:16,141
He had an incredible masculinity
at the same time.

1096
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:20,270
- You know, he's not
your traditional leading man,

1097
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,063
you know what I mean,

1098
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:23,440
<i>but it's...</i>

1099
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:25,400
there's no one like him.

1100
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,903
And he was infectious,
and he was kind,

1101
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:29,279
and he was a puppy dog.

1102
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:32,240
There was nothing malicious
about him,

1103
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,409
arrogant about him.

1104
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,203
It was a purity.

1105
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:39,998
- It may not be what you thought
was Ken doll,

1106
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:44,127
but it comes together,
and it's extremely attractive.

1107
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,587
- There was probably
a part of him

1108
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,255
that always wondered,

1109
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,340
"Do these women
want to be with me"

1110
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:49,799
"just because I'm famous,"

1111
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:51,760
"or do they really like me?"

1112
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:54,596
- He was trying to pull out of me
what it was like.

1113
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:55,972
"How does it work with fame?"

1114
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,766
"How do you live with fame"

1115
00:41:58,475 --> 00:42:00,894
"and have a really good
relationship?"

1116
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,938
- I met David Spade in a deli.

1117
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:04,439
He knew who I was

1118
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:07,567
because I was, like,
doing Victoria's Secret.

1119
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,611
He heard my voice,
and he started laughing,

1120
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,488
and I knew he was laughing
at my voice.

1121
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,782
David kept saying,
"You remind me of Chris.

1122
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:15,158
You act like Chris."

1123
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:16,701
I said,
"I want to meet this Chris,"

1124
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:19,746
and he said, "No, because
you'll fall in love with him,"

1125
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:20,914
and, um...

1126
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:22,707
the first time I met him,

1127
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:26,169
I just looked at him and said,
"I love that guy."

1128
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:28,588
And then we just started
hanging out all the time,

1129
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:29,756
you know?

1130
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:33,802
I didn't really know
the goofball so much.

1131
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:37,138
I would see it sometimes,
you know,

1132
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:40,559
but there was just
a whole different side to him

1133
00:42:40,684 --> 00:42:43,353
that I thought
was just so beautiful.

1134
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:45,730
It was just so beautiful.

1135
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,607
- We'd gone to church together,

1136
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:48,692
and we drove through
a very nice neighborhood.

1137
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:51,236
He said,
"I'd really like to settle here"

1138
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:52,821
"and have a wife
and have children,"

1139
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:54,155
"and raise my family here,"

1140
00:42:54,281 --> 00:42:57,284
I think very much similar
to what he had been raised in.

1141
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,786
He really longed for that.

1142
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:04,499
- A lot of comics,

1143
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:07,919
they're not really funny
away from performing,

1144
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:09,296
and then a few are,

1145
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:10,964
and he was one of those.

1146
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,008
He was very funny off-camera.

1147
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:13,967
As far as, like,

1148
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:15,635
just physically doing
anything for a laugh,

1149
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,262
Chris would just...
He'd do anything.

1150
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:19,764
- The funniest thing
that Chris ever did,

1151
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:22,309
and he did it pretty
much every week,

1152
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:23,810
and I always forgot,

1153
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:25,729
so I had, like,
an insane routine down.

1154
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:27,981
I'd go to the upper deck
outside of Lorne's office

1155
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,524
and watch the musical acts,

1156
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:30,649
because I knew

1157
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,652
that I would never have a chance
again in my life

1158
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:35,488
to see
so many fantastic musical acts,

1159
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:37,657
and then I would go
and have a shower

1160
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,534
at exactly the same time,

1161
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:43,163
and Chris,
every time I was in the shower,

1162
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:44,623
would rip the curtain back.

1163
00:43:44,748 --> 00:43:46,291
I'd be completely naked.

1164
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:48,543
He would tuck everything and go,

1165
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:50,754
"Michael, I love you so much,"

1166
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,965
and he would pin me
against the wall in the shower,

1167
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:57,218
and I would whale on him
like this, just whale on him,

1168
00:43:57,344 --> 00:43:59,304
like, "Get off me. Get off me."

1169
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:00,847
"Just give me one kiss, Michael.

1170
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:02,307
I love you so much."

1171
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,601
It was the most frightening
thing in the world,

1172
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:07,562
and it killed me every time,
and I forgot every week,

1173
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:08,687
because you would think

1174
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:09,564
that's not something
you'd forget,

1175
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:11,775
and every time, I'd go,
"Oh, god, of course.

1176
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,737
I should have my shower at home,
not at work."

1177
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,073
- My daughter asked me

1178
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:21,409
what was the best thing
I've ever done in show business,

1179
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:22,577
and I said,

1180
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,162
"On stage,"

1181
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:27,290
"doing 'Motivational Speaker'
with Chris Farley"

1182
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:28,415
"eight times a week,"

1183
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,542
"no question,"

1184
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,754
and nothing
will ever come close.

1185
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:35,048
- Let's get better acquainted

1186
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:37,634
by letting me give you
a little bit of a scenario

1187
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,636
of what my life is all about.

1188
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:42,514
- At Second City,
people would come in,

1189
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:45,684
like, waiters and waitresses,
bartenders, staff,

1190
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:47,686
that would come in
at, like, 9:18,

1191
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:49,562
because they knew
that's about the time

1192
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:51,731
"Motivational Speaker"
was coming on at Second City.

1193
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,858
- First off, I am 35 years old.

1194
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,235
I am divorced,

1195
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:58,405
and I live in a van
down by the river.

1196
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:02,742
- He had done some speech
in kind of that voice.

1197
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:05,995
- Bob Odenkirk and everyone else
recognized

1198
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:08,415
that they had to do something
with this character.

1199
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,750
It was just too compelling
and funny.

1200
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:11,918
- It was so fun.

1201
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:14,963
He pushed it, and he broke you,

1202
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:17,257
and did it every time.

1203
00:45:17,674 --> 00:45:18,717
It was insane.

1204
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:20,510
- Probably going to go out there
and say,

1205
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,637
"Hey, I'm going to take
the world by the tail,"

1206
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:25,807
"wrap it around, pull it down,
and put it in my pocket."

1207
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:28,184
- I thought, "What if the guy
is using himself"

1208
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,562
"as an example
of why not to do it,"

1209
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:32,731
"because of 'Look at me.
Look where I am.' "

1210
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:35,024
He is still the worst example.

1211
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:40,238
I mean, the sketch
has great structure to it,

1212
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:41,448
but the fact is,

1213
00:45:42,282 --> 00:45:45,910
it's a framework for this
insanely wonderful performance.

1214
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:48,163
- You're not going
to amount to jack squat!

1215
00:45:48,288 --> 00:45:49,288
[audience laughs]

1216
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:52,751
- It was a grand slam
every single fucking time.

1217
00:45:52,876 --> 00:45:54,127
It was nuts, nuts.

1218
00:45:54,711 --> 00:45:56,231
- As I told you,
my name is Matt Foley,

1219
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:58,131
and I am a motivational speaker.

1220
00:45:58,256 --> 00:45:59,841
[audience laughs]

1221
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:04,179
- Chris, when he did it,

1222
00:46:04,304 --> 00:46:06,639
was doing his dad
<i>as</i> a character,

1223
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,266
<i>and his dad...</i>

1224
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:10,643
great guy, but when he got mad,

1225
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:13,521
he, like,
transcended a scream level,

1226
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:15,690
scarier-sounding pocket,

1227
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:18,735
and it was more like, you know,

1228
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:23,072
"Christopher, I am not going
to tell you again."

1229
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:25,909
- Dad, I wish you could just shut
your big yapper!

1230
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:28,411
- Then we'd played rugby
with a guy, Larry Hill,

1231
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:30,663
he kind of ran
on the outside of his feet,

1232
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:32,290
so he would kind <i>of...</i>

1233
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:35,001
Larry would play rugby
like this,

1234
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:36,878
so he's there doing Larry,

1235
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:38,922
going,
"What we're going to do..."

1236
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:42,550
- Young lady, what do you want
to do with your life?

1237
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:45,887
- He took
what he loved about them

1238
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,347
and made it his own.

1239
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,058
- You're telling me
there's a real Matt Foley?

1240
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:52,936
I did not know that.
I did not know that.

1241
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:55,693
It's someone's unfortunate
position to be like,

1242
00:46:55,814 --> 00:46:57,565
"Oh, well, I'm on TV now."

1243
00:46:58,525 --> 00:46:59,818
- I am the Matt Foley.

1244
00:46:59,943 --> 00:47:01,402
It's the height of my career,

1245
00:47:01,528 --> 00:47:02,849
living in a van
down by the river.

1246
00:47:02,946 --> 00:47:04,906
Caught a lot of questions
in the last <i>25</i> years

1247
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:06,074
about that.

1248
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:10,078
- He would often name or re-name
his characters at Second City

1249
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:12,831
after friends that he would spot
in the audience,

1250
00:47:12,956 --> 00:47:14,791
and in that case,
the name just stuck.

1251
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:16,751
- Then he comes out,
"My name is Matt Foley,"

1252
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:18,127
and does that bit,

1253
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:20,922
and I just kind of sunk down
in my chair a little bit,

1254
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:23,341
and said, "Oh, my god,
where's this going?"

1255
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:26,052
- He told him, apparently,
"I'm never changing the name."

1256
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:27,679
You know.
"I'm keeping it."

1257
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:29,244
"He's always going
to be Matt Foley."

1258
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:31,182
- We're going to be buddies!

1259
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:32,642
We're going to be pals!

1260
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,435
We're going to wrestle!

1261
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:36,145
- I was humbled.

1262
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:37,831
It was a wonderful,
wonderful expression

1263
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:39,357
of our relationship,

1264
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:43,736
but my little slice of notoriety
was well appreciated,

1265
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:46,030
and I give thanks to him
every day for that.

1266
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:48,741
- I'm living in a van
down by the river!

1267
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:50,743
- You didn't often
see Second City scenes

1268
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:53,538
brought fully formed
to SNL that way.

1269
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:57,959
- He just had this thing wired
and perfected from Second City,

1270
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:00,086
so once
he even did a read-through,

1271
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:01,211
everyone loved it.

1272
00:48:01,254 --> 00:48:02,839
- Your father and I came up
with a brilliant idea

1273
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:04,924
to give you kids
some direction...

1274
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:06,801
A motivational speaker.

1275
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,887
- Yeah, it was
Christina Applegate,

1276
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:10,430
and she was the host.

1277
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:13,141
- And I remember Lorne Michaels
saying to me,

1278
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:14,934
apologetic in a way, like,

1279
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,144
"He has this character"

1280
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:18,104
"he's really been wanting
to do on the show."

1281
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:19,981
"We're not sure what it is."

1282
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:23,902
"Do you mind if we premiere it
in your episode?"

1283
00:48:24,027 --> 00:48:26,821
and I was like, "Well, yeah,
of course," you know.

1284
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:28,531
"Let's see what it is."

1285
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:30,700
- Matt, we're ready for you.

1286
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:32,702
- Out comes Chris
out of that door.

1287
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,913
- All right, how's everybody?

1288
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:38,166
Now, let's get started
by letting me give you

1289
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:42,045
a little bit of a scenario
of what my life is all about.

1290
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:44,881
First off, I am 35 years old.

1291
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,343
I am divorced,

1292
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:51,679
and I live
in a van down by the river.

1293
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:53,932
[audience laughs]

1294
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:56,434
- He'd combine
the scratchy voice,

1295
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,394
move his glasses around,
he can't see,

1296
00:48:58,519 --> 00:48:59,854
and then grabs his belt,

1297
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:00,939
or when he's sideways to you,

1298
00:49:01,064 --> 00:49:02,864
he crosses his eyes
so the audience can't see,

1299
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:04,609
try new tricks, and he'd just...

1300
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:05,777
"Huh? Huh?"

1301
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:07,779
- Okay, I'm going to go out

1302
00:49:07,904 --> 00:49:10,406
and I'm going to get the world
by the tail,

1303
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:12,241
and wrap it around
and pull it down

1304
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:13,826
and put it in my pocket.

1305
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:15,954
- We all just kind of stopped.

1306
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,455
What is going on?

1307
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:18,998
And it just, the...

1308
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,042
"Doo, doo,
on the right track."

1309
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:23,878
- How can we get back
on the right track?

1310
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,338
[audience laughs]

1311
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,049
- Bigger, and more crazy,
and we just... that was it.

1312
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:29,467
- When Chris did Matt Foley,

1313
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:32,095
he tried to make everyone
crack up.

1314
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,472
- Well, la-Di-frickin'-da.

1315
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:37,642
[audience laughs]

1316
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:40,061
We've got ourselves
a writer here.

1317
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:41,396
- I think just the combo

1318
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:44,023
of watching the audience
see it for the first time

1319
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:46,067
and realizing
this is such a funny thing,

1320
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:47,944
and we'd seen it all week.

1321
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:50,071
I started thinking
it was funnier again.

1322
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:52,365
- Ol' Matt's going
to be your shadow.

1323
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,200
Here's you, here's Matt.

1324
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:55,159
There's you, there's...

1325
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:56,284
[Crash]

1326
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:58,121
[audience laughs, applauds]

1327
00:50:00,707 --> 00:50:01,833
Whoops-a-daisy.

1328
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:03,001
- You could see me,
I'm hiding behind my hair

1329
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:03,960
because I knew

1330
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:06,087
that if I looked at him
for one second more,

1331
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:08,631
I was going to drop
off that couch.

1332
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,592
I couldn't even get my line out.

1333
00:50:11,718 --> 00:50:13,158
I knew that,
"Okay, I have one line."

1334
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:14,971
- What do you want
to do with your life?

1335
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:16,931
- "I want to live in a van
down by the river."

1336
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:19,642
It's the only joke I had
in the whole thing,

1337
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,894
and I just was like...
[whispers]

1338
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,856
- I want to live in a van
down by the river.

1339
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,983
- "I want to live in a van
down by the river,"

1340
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:28,776
and I just put my head
back down.

1341
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:29,944
- Well,
you'll have plenty of time

1342
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:32,697
to live in a van
down by the river when...

1343
00:50:32,822 --> 00:50:35,658
you're living
in a van down by the river!

1344
00:50:35,992 --> 00:50:38,661
- You can't design it
in a laboratory,

1345
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,956
but "I live in a van
down by the river..."

1346
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:45,460
The first time I heard that,
I was like, "Hm."

1347
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:47,378
"That's yummy. I know that one."

1348
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:51,007
- He made my whole body
go into convulsions of joy.

1349
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:54,927
- And I was more scared
of getting in trouble.

1350
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:56,095
I did not want
to get yelled at by Lorne.

1351
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,061
I didn't want one more reason
to get rid of me.

1352
00:50:58,097 --> 00:50:59,682
- From what I've heard,

1353
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:02,018
you're using your paper
not for writing,

1354
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:03,895
but for rolling doobies.

1355
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:08,941
You're going to be doing
a lot of doobie-rolling

1356
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:12,278
when you're living in a van
down by the river.

1357
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:14,530
- It just was thrilling.

1358
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:15,698
It was...

1359
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:18,159
it was like watching
Evel Knievel, you know.

1360
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:20,078
You just kind of
couldn't believe it.

1361
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:21,162
- We knew
that we were in the presence

1362
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:23,081
of something
that was pretty great.

1363
00:51:23,206 --> 00:51:24,957
I don't think any of us,
on that day,

1364
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:26,084
knew that "Motivational Speaker"

1365
00:51:26,209 --> 00:51:29,587
was going to become such
an iconic character for him.

1366
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:31,672
It was an incredible moment,
though.

1367
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:34,175
It was pretty cool
to see that happen.

1368
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:37,470
- I don't give a rat's behind,
because I'm moving in.

1369
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:41,349
I'm sick and tired of living
in a van down by the river!

1370
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,184
[applause]

1371
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:44,977
- I mean, he lit up a room,

1372
00:51:45,103 --> 00:51:46,562
and Chris did everything
to excess.

1373
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:48,064
He was your friend to excess.

1374
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:49,482
He loved you to excess.

1375
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,109
He was kind to excess.

1376
00:51:51,234 --> 00:51:54,570
But when it came to, you know,
drinking and other stuff,

1377
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:55,988
Chris got caught in a world

1378
00:51:56,114 --> 00:51:57,990
that I don't know
if he could get out of.

1379
00:51:58,116 --> 00:51:59,575
- Chris was one
of Lorne's favorite performers,

1380
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,993
and one of his favorite men,

1381
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,496
and truly, truly loved him.

1382
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:07,041
Lorne was never concerned
about, you know,

1383
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:10,169
<i>assisting Chris
in his artistic ability.</i>

1384
00:52:11,254 --> 00:52:13,256
He was more concerned
about the lifestyle.

1385
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:15,341
- There was some part of him
that clearly trusted

1386
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:18,052
that if he was
a little bit fucked up,

1387
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:22,098
that it would be all right,
or that it would be...

1388
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:24,475
maybe that was
where the magic came from.

1389
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,434
- Chris and Lorne

1390
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,645
had a father-figure
kind of a relationship.

1391
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,211
Lorne was always worried
about Chris,

1392
00:52:29,272 --> 00:52:31,691
and he looked out for Chris
a lot, you know.

1393
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:34,360
Lorne was very good to Chris,
and Chris looked up to Lorne.

1394
00:52:38,698 --> 00:52:39,991
- When he got to SNL,

1395
00:52:40,116 --> 00:52:43,202
whatever track he was on
<i>as</i> far as, you know,

1396
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:45,163
any drinking
or anything like that,

1397
00:52:45,288 --> 00:52:47,123
that was just sort of
set in line,

1398
00:52:47,248 --> 00:52:49,083
and so all the wheels
were in motion

1399
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:51,586
by the time we got to him,
you know.

1400
00:52:51,711 --> 00:52:53,087
It's just hard to deal with,

1401
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:55,464
and not everyone's that stable.

1402
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:59,302
I'm not, and it's very hard.

1403
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,348
- So many comedians
have low self-esteem,

1404
00:53:04,473 --> 00:53:07,226
feeling like, "Well,
if I'm not making people laugh,"

1405
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:09,729
"do I really deserve to be here?"

1406
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:13,900
- But he was this boy
who wanted to do good.

1407
00:53:14,025 --> 00:53:15,735
He wanted to impress his dad
and his mom

1408
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,445
and his family so much,

1409
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:20,448
but then there was
this other side of him,

1410
00:53:20,573 --> 00:53:23,159
so his whole life
was this constant battle.

1411
00:53:23,284 --> 00:53:26,579
- You know, bars filled
from ceiling to cash register

1412
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:27,747
full of booze,

1413
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:29,540
and he goes, "Johnny,
don't you ever look at that"

1414
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:31,083
"and just want to drink"

1415
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:33,961
"every single drop
of all that stuff right there?"

1416
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:35,171
and I go, "Nope,"

1417
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:38,674
"it didn't really
enter my mind, Chris."

1418
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:42,136
- He was a very sweet guy...

1419
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:43,763
before midnight.

1420
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:48,684
He was as open
and like a six-year-old

1421
00:53:50,061 --> 00:53:51,103
as he was dark,

1422
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:54,607
and the darkness was compelling,

1423
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:58,069
but not something
you want to really be around.

1424
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:01,197
- When he would get
super messed up,

1425
00:54:01,322 --> 00:54:02,240
he would pull away a little bit.

1426
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:05,284
"Everybody's on my ass.
I want to be by myself."

1427
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:06,953
"I've got the exact drugs
I'm going to do,"

1428
00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:08,638
"and then
I'm going to get it together,"

1429
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:09,914
which is not the way it goes.

1430
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:11,332
The way it goes
is you get messed up,

1431
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:14,961
then you really, you know,
you call your buddies.

1432
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:19,090
- When you're jumping up steps
in the showbiz ladder

1433
00:54:21,259 --> 00:54:23,302
and you're leaping
over everyone around you,

1434
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,680
and everyone around you
is going,

1435
00:54:25,805 --> 00:54:27,640
"You'd better watch out,"

1436
00:54:27,974 --> 00:54:30,226
some part of you
has to be going,

1437
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:32,478
"No, you'd better watch out,"

1438
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:35,189
"because I'm kicking ass
every day."

1439
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:37,275
- I kind of grabbed him once,

1440
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:40,444
and I just took him,
just with all my might,

1441
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:42,029
I just took him
behind this curtain

1442
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:43,281
at an after-thing,

1443
00:54:43,406 --> 00:54:45,449
and I said,
"Dude, what the fuck?"

1444
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:46,617
"Seriously?"

1445
00:54:47,118 --> 00:54:48,369
And he'd get very,

1446
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:51,247
"Michael, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

1447
00:54:51,372 --> 00:54:54,083
You're right, you're right,
you're right."

1448
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,752
I said, "Seriously, dude,
what the fuck," you know?

1449
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:58,004
- There came a point,

1450
00:54:58,129 --> 00:55:00,506
certainly there came a point
in his story

1451
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:02,216
where he gave credence

1452
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:05,177
to everyone's warnings
and worries.

1453
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:07,555
- The thing he loved the most
was doing the show,

1454
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,348
so taking it away from him,

1455
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:12,226
we sent him
to a very sort of tough place

1456
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:17,106
in the South,
I think in Alabama,

1457
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:19,942
and that period
was really hard for him,

1458
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,360
but I think it also...

1459
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,404
he came back
much clearer and determined

1460
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:26,198
that that was never
going to happen again.

1461
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:27,783
- Hey, girls.
Did I miss anything?

1462
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:28,951
[applause]

1463
00:55:30,036 --> 00:55:32,788
- Nothing.
Chrissy's being stupid again.

1464
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:33,956
- [giggles]

1465
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:36,500
- Oh, god, I love these fries.

1466
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:39,457
- If you love them so much,
why don't you marry them?

1467
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:40,504
[laughs]

1468
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:42,256
Can I have some?

1469
00:55:43,341 --> 00:55:45,259
- Um, sure, Cindy, go ahead.

1470
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,428
- Oh, god, these are good.

1471
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,056
- Uh, Cindy,
can you leave some for us?

1472
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:51,223
- [laughs]

1473
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:54,477
- I thought you were, um,
trying to lose weight.

1474
00:55:54,602 --> 00:55:56,896
- [deep voice] Lay off me,
I'm starving.

1475
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:58,564
[applause]

1476
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:01,817
[giggles]

1477
00:56:02,735 --> 00:56:04,153
Diet starts Monday.

1478
00:56:05,905 --> 00:56:08,025
- There was this steak joint
called "the Steak Joint,"

1479
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:11,243
and they had this thing called
the Trenchman's Cut, which...

1480
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:13,537
This thing was probably
this big and this wide,

1481
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:14,705
roast beef,

1482
00:56:14,914 --> 00:56:16,082
and I'd be, like,

1483
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:17,958
"How are you going to eat that
and go on stage?"

1484
00:56:18,084 --> 00:56:19,919
He'd be like, "I can do it."

1485
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:22,505
We'd all be like, "Go, go, go."

1486
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:24,882
- Oh, look, Tammy,
it's the Gap girls,

1487
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:26,007
and they're eating.

1488
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:27,176
What a surprise.

1489
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,928
- You're so dumb,

1490
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,722
when they were passing out
brains,

1491
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:34,016
you thought they said "trains,"

1492
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:36,894
<i>and then... you got on it...
on</i> a <i>train,</i>

1493
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,438
and then went for a ride.

1494
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:41,065
[applause]

1495
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:45,277
- Two rib-eyes, medium...

1496
00:56:45,403 --> 00:56:47,196
and I'm not exaggerating,
I'm not trying to be funny,

1497
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:48,864
he'd taken the rib-eyes,

1498
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:50,032
he'd kind of put it in his mouth

1499
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:51,158
and stripped it,
kind of, almost...

1500
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:53,077
like a sparerib or something.

1501
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:54,078
And I look over at the plate,

1502
00:56:54,203 --> 00:56:55,204
and both the rib-eyes
are gone.

1503
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,622
Later on, we were walking,

1504
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:59,542
and I said, "Those steaks,
the way you ate that..."

1505
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:02,420
and he says, "I know. I know.
What am I doing?"

1506
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:04,380
and whenever he said
"What am I doing?"

1507
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:05,381
you knew
that he knew everything.

1508
00:57:05,506 --> 00:57:06,507
He knew everything
about himself.

1509
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:08,926
Nothing was, like,
sneaking past him.

1510
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:10,094
It just seemed

1511
00:57:10,511 --> 00:57:11,512
like there was always something
massive that he was doing,

1512
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:13,431
something big, something huge.

1513
00:57:13,556 --> 00:57:15,891
- Jeez, those two
are always OTR.

1514
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,602
- [gasps]

1515
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:20,312
You two are terrible!

1516
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:21,939
[giggling]

1517
00:57:22,398 --> 00:57:24,442
- Sometimes he would head-butt me
in sketches,

1518
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:27,069
get so close
it would throw you off,

1519
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:30,448
like "What's going... you're
not supposed to do that."

1520
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:32,241
So that was funny,
and he liked it,

1521
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:35,703
and he'd go "I made you laugh,"
and get excited,

1522
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:37,371
like a child.

1523
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,081
- I'll tell you
what he never did.

1524
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:40,583
He didn't make it about himself.

1525
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:43,794
Never sat back
and was cocky about killing.

1526
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:47,548
His laughs were so huge
and thick and long,

1527
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:50,092
the giant roars,

1528
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:52,678
I'd say,
"Did you hear how you...?"

1529
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:54,524
He'd be like, "Really?
Really? It was good?"

1530
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:56,515
If I had some of those roars,
I would definitely

1531
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,477
have a lot more of an attitude
right now.

1532
00:57:59,727 --> 00:58:01,395
I don't think
I'd be hanging out with you.

1533
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,105
- The world of high fashion...

1534
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:05,608
There was never anyone
like Dante.

1535
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,489
- These designs are atrocious.

1536
00:58:12,198 --> 00:58:13,949
Are you trying to ruin me?

1537
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,327
- I shared an office that year,

1538
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:18,996
10 feet wide
with just two wooden desks.

1539
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:20,164
- Oh, Dante...

1540
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:21,832
- I sat there.

1541
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:23,292
Behind me was him.

1542
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:26,212
- That's the third assistant
you've fired this month.

1543
00:58:26,337 --> 00:58:27,838
- I had to write my own stuff,
which was tough.

1544
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:30,382
He didn't write or read
or really do anything,

1545
00:58:30,508 --> 00:58:33,552
but he was funny,
and that was more important.

1546
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:38,933
- I'll have not have
my decisions questioned, Lucien.

1547
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:42,520
In bed, you're my partner,

1548
00:58:42,645 --> 00:58:45,147
but in this office,
you work for me.

1549
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:50,861
- But, Dante...
[laughs]

1550
00:58:51,529 --> 00:58:52,571
- Go away.

1551
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:56,411
- Chris Rock and Sandler
had to walk through ours

1552
00:58:56,492 --> 00:58:57,868
to get to their little office,

1553
00:58:57,993 --> 00:58:59,995
so they would come in and out,

1554
00:59:00,496 --> 00:59:01,497
and then
when they locked their door,

1555
00:59:01,622 --> 00:59:03,457
you know they're starting
to write hard...

1556
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:05,376
especially Sandler wrote a lot.

1557
00:59:05,501 --> 00:59:08,754
- He was a really giving guy
to the other comedians.

1558
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:10,631
Loved the other comedians,

1559
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:13,008
and if you made Farley laugh,
my god, that felt good,

1560
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:14,677
with that giant laugh of his.

1561
00:59:14,802 --> 00:59:16,679
- Okay, I've got a package here
for Dante.

1562
00:59:16,804 --> 00:59:17,846
- I am Dante.

1563
00:59:18,347 --> 00:59:20,015
- All right, here you go.

1564
00:59:20,516 --> 00:59:21,559
Sign on the X.

1565
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:23,102
- There.

1566
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:27,314
I'll sign your precious
Federal Express receipt,

1567
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:30,442
and now I wish
you could do me a favor

1568
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:31,735
and buzz off.

1569
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:33,195
- Oh, man.

1570
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:35,114
- There you go.
Excellent!

1571
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:36,282
[cackles]

1572
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:38,116
All right.

1573
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:41,203
- Peekaboo, Dante.

1574
00:59:42,788 --> 00:59:45,708
- I was playing
some overly fey character

1575
00:59:46,709 --> 00:59:50,212
in the designing
of clothes industry, I believe.

1576
00:59:50,713 --> 00:59:53,882
- Well, well, well,
if it isn't Taylor Evans.

1577
00:59:55,718 --> 00:59:58,304
If you've come looking
for modeling work,

1578
00:59:58,429 --> 00:59:59,763
you're out of luck.

1579
00:59:59,888 --> 01:00:02,641
I don't let whores
walk down my runway.

1580
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:06,729
- Charming as always, Dante,

1581
01:00:06,854 --> 01:00:10,024
but I don't intend to take "no"
for an answer.

1582
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:13,819
- Well, then, perhaps
you'll take this for an answer.

1583
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:14,987
- "Now go!"

1584
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:17,865
And then at one point,

1585
01:00:18,407 --> 01:00:20,701
there was
a little fluffa happened.

1586
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:23,245
There was
a line that got skipped,

1587
01:00:23,412 --> 01:00:26,248
and I just, like,
pushed his glasses up,

1588
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:28,626
and his eyes crossed.

1589
01:00:31,003 --> 01:00:34,673
It was this delicate moment
that made me very happy.

1590
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,926
- I have grown wise
to your trickery, Dante.

1591
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:42,306
- He came from that background
where you pull everybody up,

1592
01:00:42,431 --> 01:00:43,671
that you're there for everybody.

1593
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:45,392
You don't leave anybody hanging,

1594
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:46,477
so when you're working with him,

1595
01:00:46,602 --> 01:00:49,438
he was just right there
and helping you.

1596
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:53,442
"Come on, buddy," you know,
that kind of thing.

1597
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:56,195
- I was very influenced
by his commitment,

1598
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,072
full, all his molecules,

1599
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:01,867
and anybody around him's
molecules,

1600
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:03,577
into his performance.

1601
01:01:04,662 --> 01:01:06,914
- So powerful and so ungoverned,

1602
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:09,667
and that was a big part
of, I think, you know,

1603
01:01:09,792 --> 01:01:10,626
Chris's appeal.

1604
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:13,504
You always had the
sense that he was...

1605
01:01:15,381 --> 01:01:16,924
he was having
the most fun possible.

1606
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:20,469
- Why, it seems the liposuction
done on your face

1607
01:01:20,678 --> 01:01:22,596
has clogged your eardrums.

1608
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:25,265
Make like an egg, and beat it.

1609
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:27,935
- It's a word
I wouldn't normally use,

1610
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:30,771
but there was something
always dutiful about him.

1611
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:32,606
He cared about the whole show.

1612
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:36,652
He never fought for his piece
over someone else's piece.

1613
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:39,363
He was most comfortable
being part of it

1614
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:41,281
and caring about it.

1615
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:46,870
- Chris said,
"I want to become so famous"

1616
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:51,291
"that I can go
to children's hospitals"

1617
01:01:51,417 --> 01:01:54,962
"and I can cheer the kids up,
and they'll know who I am."

1618
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:57,881
Not a Ferrari, not mansions,
not go to Europe.

1619
01:01:58,006 --> 01:01:59,049
That's it.

1620
01:01:59,508 --> 01:02:00,718
Like,
that kind of summed up Chris.

1621
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:03,679
- Chris walks
into St. Jude's Hospital.

1622
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:06,181
Within 60 seconds
of being in that kid's room,

1623
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:07,349
they don't care who he is.

1624
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:08,715
They don't care about his fame.

1625
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:10,568
They just know
they're madly in love with him.

1626
01:02:10,686 --> 01:02:12,521
And he picks up an IV
and goes, 'Urrr, '

1627
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:13,939
makes believe he's drinking.

1628
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:16,608
The kid doesn't care
about show business.

1629
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:18,068
It's not Tom Brady.

1630
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,403
It's Chris.

1631
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,703
- Chris was a real Catholic
in the best sense,

1632
01:02:21,739 --> 01:02:23,824
not in a casual passing sense.

1633
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:25,951
He lived it.
He walked the walk.

1634
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:28,829
He went and visited people
on weekends

1635
01:02:29,121 --> 01:02:30,706
and didn't even tell anybody
about it, like,

1636
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:32,708
to bring them meals
or make them laugh.

1637
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:34,626
- His dad told him
a long time ago,

1638
01:02:34,752 --> 01:02:36,795
"Only by the grace of God go I,"

1639
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,672
so he saw those
that were most vulnerable,

1640
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:40,716
and he saw how blessed he was

1641
01:02:40,883 --> 01:02:43,969
and recognized
that those people, I think,

1642
01:02:44,803 --> 01:02:46,138
he related to best.

1643
01:02:46,764 --> 01:02:49,016
- The acts of kindness
that he did off-camera,

1644
01:02:49,141 --> 01:02:52,644
which were true acts
of sort of piety and modesty,

1645
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,524
that part of him
I don't think people knew.

1646
01:02:57,649 --> 01:02:58,692
- We would go
by a homeless person

1647
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:01,487
and I'd go,
"Uh, I don't have anything,"

1648
01:03:01,612 --> 01:03:02,654
and Chris goes,

1649
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,865
"What if we just passed
Jesus Christ?"

1650
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:06,492
"You know, they say he could
come back as a homeless man"

1651
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:07,617
"or something."

1652
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:09,328
"Maybe he's testing us."

1653
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:12,790
- Kevin Nealon and Mike Myers
and Adam Sandler and David Spade

1654
01:03:12,915 --> 01:03:14,291
were all sitting around,

1655
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:16,293
and someone says, "How big
do you think you're going to be"

1656
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:17,586
"as a performer?"

1657
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:19,797
And it went around the room,
and they were all going, like,

1658
01:03:19,922 --> 01:03:21,715
"I don't know.
I'll be pretty big, I guess."

1659
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,467
"I don't know.
I'm pretty funny."

1660
01:03:23,592 --> 01:03:24,760
"I think I'll do fine,"

1661
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:25,969
and everyone kind of leaves,
you know,

1662
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:27,387
and it's just Chris and I
were left in the room there,

1663
01:03:27,513 --> 01:03:28,931
you know, and I go, "Really?"

1664
01:03:29,056 --> 01:03:30,098
"Yeah ."

1665
01:03:30,349 --> 01:03:31,350
"Really,
that's what you think?"

1666
01:03:31,475 --> 01:03:32,684
and he looked around, waited
for them to be out of earshot,

1667
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:34,853
and then he goes,
"I'm going to be so huge."

1668
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:36,897
"Oh, my god,
I'm going to be so huge."

1669
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:38,357
"I'm going to be a giant star."

1670
01:03:38,482 --> 01:03:39,650
- Let me tell you something.

1671
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,693
On that program,
no offense to anybody else,

1672
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:44,404
you're the life of the party,
buddy.

1673
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,073
[audience cheers]

1674
01:03:46,198 --> 01:03:47,950
- Scripts are coming in.
You're reading constantly.

1675
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:49,868
You're trying to figure out
what are the best moves.

1676
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:52,113
I always call it the ride,
where the ride is headed up

1677
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,455
and the trajectory
is straight up,

1678
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,873
and that's where Chris was.

1679
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:58,043
- I was there when Lorne
was developing Chris as a talent

1680
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:01,088
and then breaking him out
<i>as</i> a movie star.

1681
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:03,382
- When we were shooting
Wayne's World,

1682
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:04,883
Chris was in it for one scene.

1683
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:06,426
He played the security guard,

1684
01:04:06,552 --> 01:04:08,220
and Mike and Dana
were, you know,

1685
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:09,721
at the top of their game.

1686
01:04:09,847 --> 01:04:10,722
- I remember on Wayne's World,

1687
01:04:10,848 --> 01:04:13,267
he turned to me
and said, "How am I doing?"

1688
01:04:13,392 --> 01:04:14,560
"Is it going well?"

1689
01:04:14,685 --> 01:04:15,811
I said, "Yeah, it's going well."

1690
01:04:15,936 --> 01:04:16,937
I said, "I'd just like
to point out, Chris,"

1691
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:17,938
"that this is my first movie."

1692
01:04:18,063 --> 01:04:20,065
"I've actually never even
been in a movie."

1693
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,860
"This is my absolute first movie,
so I'm..."

1694
01:04:22,985 --> 01:04:26,321
"Well, you seem so at home
and seem so natural,"

1695
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:28,240
and I said, "It's not."

1696
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:29,575
"I'm terrified,"

1697
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:32,160
"and I have no idea
what I'm doing."

1698
01:04:32,286 --> 01:04:34,121
- He was so sweet in Coneheads
and wonderful,

1699
01:04:34,246 --> 01:04:36,957
and just to be on the set
with him was great.

1700
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:39,751
- Chris was the romantic lead.

1701
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:44,882
- When you first sign somebody
as an agent,

1702
01:04:45,007 --> 01:04:47,007
you want to introduce them
to everybody in the town

1703
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:48,931
who can make a difference
in their movie career.

1704
01:04:49,011 --> 01:04:50,554
First of all, he wore
the same thing to every meeting,

1705
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:54,933
which was a button-down white
tearaway SNL wardrobe shirt,

1706
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:56,810
so it would have
the buttons down,

1707
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:58,979
but underneath it was Velcro...

1708
01:04:59,104 --> 01:05:01,607
and he wore that probably
three or four days in a row.

1709
01:05:01,732 --> 01:05:02,774
- All right.

1710
01:05:02,983 --> 01:05:04,484
- [laughs]
It's a clip-on.

1711
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:05,652
- Are you sure?

1712
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:06,945
All right, now...

1713
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,322
- Wayne's World, the Coneheads,

1714
01:05:08,447 --> 01:05:10,688
all of those little cameos,
we can call them, that he did

1715
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:11,909
were getting him
more and more notice.

1716
01:05:12,034 --> 01:05:14,953
It was still very much
within the SNL family,

1717
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:17,039
and Billy Madison
was Adam saying, you know,

1718
01:05:17,164 --> 01:05:18,832
"I want Chris
to play this part."

1719
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:23,003
- Everybody on?
Good. Great.

1720
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:24,463
Grand! Wonderful!

1721
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:27,382
No yelling on the bus!

1722
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:30,344
Hey!
[tires screeching]

1723
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:31,762
- You laugh at the fact

1724
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:33,207
that this guy's
been through hell,

1725
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:36,016
and he's handling it
to the best he can,

1726
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:38,352
and he's still lovable.

1727
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:41,897
- I'll turn this damn bus
around.

1728
01:05:42,064 --> 01:05:44,524
That'll end
your precious little field trip

1729
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,318
pretty damn quick, huh?

1730
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:50,030
Shit.

1731
01:05:52,658 --> 01:05:53,909
- That was bananas.

1732
01:05:54,034 --> 01:05:55,327
We don't even know
what the hell happened to him.

1733
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:56,787
He turned dark red,

1734
01:05:57,037 --> 01:05:59,706
and I remember having to cut
around literally every take.

1735
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:00,958
Like, it would be like,

1736
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:03,168
"I think we've got three frames
before Adam laughed there,"

1737
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:04,836
"so maybe we can use that shot
right there."

1738
01:06:04,962 --> 01:06:06,672
It was hard to cut around,
but he was nuts.

1739
01:06:06,797 --> 01:06:07,798
He was nuts.

1740
01:06:07,923 --> 01:06:09,925
He was so loose
as the bus driver.

1741
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:12,636
- All of these guys
tend to work together

1742
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:13,971
and collaborate.

1743
01:06:14,096 --> 01:06:16,348
The environment there
just breeds friendship.

1744
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:17,683
- Everyone knew he had talent,

1745
01:06:17,808 --> 01:06:19,601
and everyone wanted him
in their movie,

1746
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:21,103
and he was riding high.

1747
01:06:21,228 --> 01:06:24,022
It was nice to see him just
kind of rolling, doing well.

1748
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:25,147
He started wearing suits.

1749
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:27,442
He'd go down
to the Rochester Big and Tall

1750
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:29,236
and buy, like, 10 suits,

1751
01:06:29,778 --> 01:06:31,071
and he'd slick his hair back,

1752
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:32,823
and I'm like, "Who's this guy?"

1753
01:06:32,948 --> 01:06:34,741
"What are you, a Hollywood guy?"

1754
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:35,867
But it was fun.
It was fun to see.

1755
01:06:35,993 --> 01:06:37,744
- It was cool to see the man

1756
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:42,290
driving up in, like,
a convertible Caddy or something

1757
01:06:42,416 --> 01:06:45,210
and just having huge money
and tipping people

1758
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:49,006
and just being like
what you expect he would be.

1759
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:53,176
- He loved to be an actor.
He just loved it.

1760
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:54,970
He loved every minute of it,
you know,

1761
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:56,763
and so he was just happy,

1762
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:59,141
just having a good time,
killing it.

1763
01:07:01,268 --> 01:07:02,644
- In Hollywood in the old days,
they used to call it "it,"

1764
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:03,769
when someone had "it."

1765
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:04,938
They didn't know
how to describe it either,

1766
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:07,107
so they called it "it,"
and he had "it."

1767
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:08,672
- The pressure
of Saturday Night Live

1768
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:09,943
is once you get the show,

1769
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:11,309
everyone's looking at you like,

1770
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:13,697
"Oh, you have a chance
to do movies and be famous

1771
01:07:13,822 --> 01:07:15,115
and be a movie star."

1772
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,034
- First of all, to get a movie,
that's the hustle.

1773
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:18,827
You have to be able
to get in the movie,

1774
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:20,162
and Chris got in the movie,

1775
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:23,123
and the movie
that he got in was Tommy Boy.

1776
01:07:27,044 --> 01:07:28,086
- Aah!

1777
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,297
- I've got
to go to the bathroom, Daddy.

1778
01:07:30,422 --> 01:07:32,132
[music] Maniac... [music]

1779
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:34,760
Aah!

1780
01:07:35,469 --> 01:07:37,304
- If you mention Tommy Boy,

1781
01:07:37,429 --> 01:07:39,723
80% of the people go
"Fat guy in a little coat"

1782
01:07:39,848 --> 01:07:42,017
because of the way
Chris did it, what it was,

1783
01:07:42,142 --> 01:07:43,222
and all that sort of stuff,

1784
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:45,187
and that to me
is the best way to say

1785
01:07:45,312 --> 01:07:46,313
that's Chris Farley.

1786
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:47,481
- Richard...

1787
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:49,775
Is this your coat?

1788
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,026
- Fat guy in a little coat

1789
01:07:51,151 --> 01:07:52,944
was something
that Farley did to Spade.

1790
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:55,072
- Don't do it.
- Fat guy in a little coat.

1791
01:07:55,197 --> 01:07:56,637
- In my office,
he'd put the coat on.

1792
01:07:56,698 --> 01:07:58,658
"David,
I've got your jacket on."

1793
01:07:58,784 --> 01:08:00,535
"Fat..."
- Fat guy in a little coat.

1794
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:01,703
- Don't.

1795
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:04,623
- David, for real, would say,
"Chris, take it off."

1796
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:06,124
"Take the jacket off."

1797
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:07,542
"You're going to break my ja...
You're going to split it."

1798
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:09,169
"Take it off.
Take it off."

1799
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:10,962
"Oh, fat guy in a little coat."

1800
01:08:11,088 --> 01:08:13,256
- [music] Fat guy
in a little coat... [music]

1801
01:08:14,883 --> 01:08:16,802
- Take it off, dickhead.
I'm serious.

1802
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:18,261
- Richard, what's happening?

1803
01:08:18,386 --> 01:08:19,386
[ripping]

1804
01:08:20,514 --> 01:08:23,308
- He and Spade were
just induplicable as a team,

1805
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:24,559
wonderful together.

1806
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:26,103
David is very acerbic,

1807
01:08:26,228 --> 01:08:28,730
and he's, you know,
he's a toughie,

1808
01:08:29,231 --> 01:08:30,732
and Chris is a softie.

1809
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:33,318
You've got the best
of Belushi and Aykroyd,

1810
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:35,112
of Abbott and Costello,

1811
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:37,405
of Martin and Lewis.

1812
01:08:37,531 --> 01:08:41,701
You had just a perfect yin-yang
situation with those guys.

1813
01:08:42,244 --> 01:08:43,370
- A fantastic combination

1814
01:08:43,495 --> 01:08:46,164
of ultimately innocent
and ultimately jaded.

1815
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:51,169
They are the oil and vinegar
of comedy.

1816
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:57,175
- Ugh, I can actually hear you
getting fatter.

1817
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,178
- They would react to stress
in different ways.

1818
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:03,682
Chris would get bigger,
and there'd be less of David,

1819
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:04,891
and I used to say

1820
01:09:05,142 --> 01:09:07,060
that the amount of weight
in the frame

1821
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:10,105
kind of stayed constant,
you know, in a two-shot.

1822
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:12,023
- They were funny.
They were close.

1823
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:14,192
You could tell they
were really good friends,

1824
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:16,778
and only really,
really good friends

1825
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:18,989
can fight the way they fought.

1826
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:20,073
- You don't want none of me.
Think it through.

1827
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:21,783
- Come on, give me
your best shot.

1828
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:23,118
I'll give you a free one.
Let me have it.

1829
01:09:23,243 --> 01:09:24,243
[grunts]

1830
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:27,205
That was a good one.

1831
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,330
- They'd throw something

1832
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:29,916
and not speak to each other
for a couple hours,

1833
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:31,042
and we'd all sit there and laugh

1834
01:09:31,168 --> 01:09:33,211
and watch this thing
go back and forth.

1835
01:09:33,336 --> 01:09:34,379
- That's it!

1836
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:36,590
You are going to die!

1837
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:39,801
I am going to get you!

1838
01:09:40,385 --> 01:09:42,679
- And when I would visit
those fools during the shoot,

1839
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:45,098
they'd have little fights
on occasion,

1840
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:47,225
and Farley would have a snap,

1841
01:09:47,559 --> 01:09:50,312
and Spade would be scared
for his life.

1842
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:52,063
They were in love
with each other.

1843
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:53,356
We all were in love,

1844
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:54,858
but Spade and Farley

1845
01:09:54,983 --> 01:09:57,903
had a definite
brotherly relationship.

1846
01:09:59,196 --> 01:10:01,948
- Tommy Boy is basically
a skeleton sketch

1847
01:10:02,073 --> 01:10:04,159
of how we grew up in Wisconsin,

1848
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:06,703
minus Bo Derek, of course.

1849
01:10:06,828 --> 01:10:09,039
- I met Chris
literally on the set,

1850
01:10:09,164 --> 01:10:10,290
and I looked down,

1851
01:10:10,415 --> 01:10:11,958
and Chris was doing pushups,

1852
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:13,126
<i>and just...</i>

1853
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:15,978
And he got up,
and his face was beet red,

1854
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:18,089
and he was so cute, so adorable.

1855
01:10:18,215 --> 01:10:19,466
- Holy schnykies.

1856
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:23,762
- First scene, of course,
was the swimming pool scene.

1857
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:24,930
- Oh, man.

1858
01:10:25,597 --> 01:10:27,015
Dad, she's like a 10.

1859
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:29,017
- Hi, honey.

1860
01:10:29,309 --> 01:10:30,810
- And Chris was funny all day,

1861
01:10:30,936 --> 01:10:32,938
and he actually made me relax

1862
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:34,898
by making fun of me, kind of,

1863
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:36,107
which was good.

1864
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:37,442
- I'm Tommy.

1865
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:40,237
- I'm Beverly,
and you are just adorable.

1866
01:10:40,362 --> 01:10:41,196
{giggles}

1867
01:10:41,321 --> 01:10:42,801
- Brian Dennehy's character
and Chris,

1868
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:45,033
that was a lot of him
and my dad.

1869
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:47,202
It's kind of like
who my dad was, you know,

1870
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:51,164
this big, gruff,
great salesman guy, you know.

1871
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:53,750
- Hi, Dad.

1872
01:10:54,042 --> 01:10:55,042
- Tommy!

1873
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:56,378
[both laugh]

1874
01:10:57,462 --> 01:10:58,672
- Ooh...

1875
01:11:02,676 --> 01:11:03,969
- We had that in common.

1876
01:11:04,094 --> 01:11:06,263
We both loved our dads,
and we both were...

1877
01:11:06,388 --> 01:11:07,948
anything our fathers said,
we'd be like,

1878
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:10,850
"Well, now I have to do it,
because my dad told me to."

1879
01:11:12,269 --> 01:11:14,069
- Scram, don't give her
the weight room thing.

1880
01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:15,981
- Do you know
where the weight room is?

1881
01:11:16,106 --> 01:11:17,357
I'll check it out.

1882
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:18,817
- Sorry.

1883
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:22,529
- I was hanging out with David
and Chris and Fred Wolf,

1884
01:11:22,654 --> 01:11:24,197
so he wrote a part for me,

1885
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:26,199
but I wasn't supposed
to be naked in that part.

1886
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:28,245
I was supposed to just
jump in the swimming pool,

1887
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:29,326
and then they're like,

1888
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:30,453
"Okay, and then you
take your bathing suit..."

1889
01:11:30,578 --> 01:11:31,621
and I was like "What?"

1890
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:34,082
and they're like, "We rented out
this whole thing,"

1891
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:35,250
and da da da da da.

1892
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:37,168
"You're not going
to not do it now, are you?"

1893
01:11:37,294 --> 01:11:39,254
It was such a pressure thing.

1894
01:11:39,379 --> 01:11:40,922
Chris was so worried about,

1895
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:42,549
"You've got to make her
comfortable,"

1896
01:11:42,674 --> 01:11:46,136
and he would just always try
to make me laugh, like,

1897
01:11:46,261 --> 01:11:49,097
or always put a towel
around me, like...

1898
01:11:49,389 --> 01:11:52,726
he was just being
such a protective gentleman.

1899
01:11:53,101 --> 01:11:54,352
- I'm back.

1900
01:11:57,731 --> 01:11:58,773
Richard?

1901
01:11:59,441 --> 01:12:00,859
What were you doing?

1902
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:02,902
- Going over some documents.

1903
01:12:03,028 --> 01:12:04,195
- Look at his movie performances.

1904
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:05,739
The physicality, I mean...

1905
01:12:05,864 --> 01:12:07,699
and Tommy Boy, just the...

1906
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:10,035
you saw
his quality as an actor there,

1907
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,661
and his range as an actor.

1908
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:13,330
- I'm going to really miss him.

1909
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:16,833
- Your father was a great guy.

1910
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:18,001
- Yeah.

1911
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:19,085
- What I think
was really important

1912
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:20,253
with Tommy Boy

1913
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:21,838
is it showed Chris
how we saw him

1914
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:23,048
behind closed doors.

1915
01:12:23,173 --> 01:12:24,424
Sensitive. Kind.

1916
01:12:24,716 --> 01:12:27,260
That kindness,
and that real vulnerability.

1917
01:12:27,385 --> 01:12:29,971
- Oh, Richard, I'm so happy.
Hold me.

1918
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:31,222
- Yikes.

1919
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:33,516
- Don't run away
from your feelings.

1920
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:34,976
- It's so great
when everyone leaves you alone.

1921
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:36,144
We're just trying <i>to...</i>

1922
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:37,228
"What's the funniest thing
we can do here"

1923
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:38,855
"that makes us laugh?"

1924
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:41,149
Sandler, during Tommy Boy,

1925
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:43,610
wrote him a sketch
in Pepper Boy.

1926
01:12:44,778 --> 01:12:45,820
- Say when.

1927
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:47,364
- When.

1928
01:12:47,489 --> 01:12:48,489
- Grazie.

1929
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:49,991
- Adam Sandler
is Pepper Boy, right?

1930
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:51,368
It's like, you know,
"Fresh pepper?"

1931
01:12:51,493 --> 01:12:52,952
and he would give people pepper.

1932
01:12:53,078 --> 01:12:54,496
He's under high scrutiny
for this.

1933
01:12:54,621 --> 01:12:56,581
- It is an art
of the Pepper Boy, Carlo.

1934
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:58,333
Don't let it die with me.

1935
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:00,335
Please, let me teach it to you.

1936
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,128
- Teach me, Senor Marco.

1937
01:13:02,629 --> 01:13:05,030
- We had to fly all the way back
from Toronto to do the show,

1938
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:06,424
and I wasn't even in it.

1939
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:08,301
- All right.
You see that man right there?

1940
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:09,302
- Farley was in it,

1941
01:13:09,427 --> 01:13:10,762
but he only had one line
in that sketch,

1942
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:12,263
so he was mad about it,

1943
01:13:12,389 --> 01:13:14,599
so he put on this huge beard.
He looked ridiculous.

1944
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:16,226
He goes, "Watch this line.
I'll get a laugh,"

1945
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:18,311
and I'm like,
"I don't think so."

1946
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:19,771
"You're not supposed to.
It's supposed to be Sandler,"

1947
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:20,939
but...

1948
01:13:21,106 --> 01:13:22,357
- Fresh-y pepper?

1949
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,067
- He goes, "Oh yeah? Huh?"

1950
01:13:24,192 --> 01:13:25,192
Bite his lip,

1951
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:26,111
and you knew
you were in trouble.

1952
01:13:26,236 --> 01:13:28,238
- Why, thank you, Pepper Boy!

1953
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,950
That's the perfect
amount of pepper.

1954
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:34,035
Bravo!

1955
01:13:34,411 --> 01:13:36,579
- "Why, thank you, Pepper BOY,"

1956
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:39,040
and we're like...

1957
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:41,709
- Of course,
if you only have one line,

1958
01:13:41,835 --> 01:13:45,088
why did you fucking put on
a beard for one Li...

1959
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:47,882
Like, it's, like,
this is the funniest shit ever,

1960
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:50,093
and he's, like, just the guy...

1961
01:13:50,218 --> 01:13:52,053
He's a warm body in the sketch.

1962
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:53,596
It's an Adam Sandler sketch.

1963
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:54,764
- Bravo!

1964
01:13:55,432 --> 01:13:57,183
- That was his, like,
fighting back

1965
01:13:57,308 --> 01:13:59,018
at, "Watch how funny I can be,"

1966
01:13:59,144 --> 01:14:00,728
and it works.
He's great at it.

1967
01:14:00,854 --> 01:14:02,689
-30 seconds before a skit,

1968
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:04,649
would tap you on the shoulder
and go,

1969
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:05,817
"I'm going to get you."

1970
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:08,194
He did that a few times to me,
and he always got me.

1971
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:10,321
- You did it!
How do you feel?

1972
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:12,365
- Like I can fly, senor,

1973
01:14:13,408 --> 01:14:15,076
on wings made of pepper.

1974
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,955
- He was aware of his power.

1975
01:14:19,456 --> 01:14:20,456
He was aware of his gift.

1976
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:21,791
He's got his BA
from Second City.

1977
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:24,169
He's got his Master's
from Saturday Night Live.

1978
01:14:24,294 --> 01:14:25,420
Totally equipped-

1979
01:14:25,545 --> 01:14:26,379
- Saturday Night Live

1980
01:14:26,504 --> 01:14:28,006
with a feature film
where he's the lead...

1981
01:14:28,131 --> 01:14:29,382
I can't imagine the pressure

1982
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:31,176
of just flying alone
back and forth

1983
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:32,677
to be doing a movie,
then flying for the show,

1984
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:33,845
then fly back

1985
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:35,347
to be up at 5:00 a.m.
Monday morning

1986
01:14:35,472 --> 01:14:36,556
to shoot the mov...

1987
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:38,224
I mean,
it's incredible pressure.

1988
01:14:38,349 --> 01:14:39,392
- That's going
to wear everybody down,

1989
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:41,561
but it didn't wear Chris down
at all,

1990
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:42,520
not even a little bit.

1991
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:44,063
<i>He didn't seem...</i>
he <i>didn't...</i>

1992
01:14:44,189 --> 01:14:45,523
I would...
"How are you doing?"

1993
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:46,608
"Yeah, it's great.
So what are we doing now?"

1994
01:14:46,733 --> 01:14:48,693
He just didn't show
any signs of wear at all.

1995
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:50,904
- He will be
a major motion picture star

1996
01:14:51,029 --> 01:14:52,530
when his brand-new film,
Tommy Boy,

1997
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:53,656
opens nationwide.

1998
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:54,616
Ladies and gentlemen,

1999
01:14:54,741 --> 01:14:56,367
please welcome
the human thunderball,

2000
01:14:56,493 --> 01:14:57,535
Chris Farley.

2001
01:14:57,994 --> 01:14:59,662

[audience cheers louder]

2004
01:15:24,938 --> 01:15:25,855
A very impressive entrance.

2005
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:27,482
I think in the 10 years
we've been doing this show,

2006
01:15:27,607 --> 01:15:30,443
I've never seen anything
quite like that.

2007
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:31,929
- I want to do
what the king wants,

2008
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:33,530
so I'd like to do that.

2009
01:15:35,532 --> 01:15:38,409
I'm on the Dave Letterman show!
By golly...

2010
01:15:38,535 --> 01:15:39,452
- How are you doing, buddy?

2011
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:41,287
All excited
about your big movie?

2012
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:42,693
- Aw, man.
- You and David Spade.

2013
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:44,707
David Spade, a very funny man,
very nice guy,

2014
01:15:44,832 --> 01:15:46,334
and you guys are friends

2015
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:47,794
as well as working together
on the show,

2016
01:15:47,919 --> 01:15:49,420
and now on this big movie.

2017
01:15:49,546 --> 01:15:51,506
- Yeah, he's my buddy.
We had a lot of fun.

2018
01:15:51,631 --> 01:15:54,717
- When the movie came out,
the reviews were bad.

2019
01:15:54,842 --> 01:15:58,846
For him, the idea that it could
be that willfully hurtful

2020
01:15:59,389 --> 01:16:00,431
took him back,

2021
01:16:01,766 --> 01:16:02,767
and he didn't have
the confidence yet,

2022
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:04,686
because it was his first movie,
you know,

2023
01:16:04,811 --> 01:16:07,355
because I'd say,
"Let them wash over you,"

2024
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,107
"and in two weeks,
nobody will care."

2025
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:10,525
"All that matters is the work,"

2026
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:13,820
"and it's a piece of work
that will be around."

2027
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:17,031
- When the video came out,
it was an obsession.

2028
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:21,786
Our generation was into him,
and that was the coolest.

2029
01:16:23,121 --> 01:16:26,040
- It's interesting that a movie
that was that savaged

2030
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:29,919
ended up being sort of a movie
that's never gone away.

2031
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:34,841
- Time magazine published a page
of the 10 Comedies of All Time,

2032
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:37,677
and Tommy Boy's there,

2033
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:41,681
and I know that Farley
would have been incredibly proud

2034
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:42,890
to see it there.

2035
01:16:43,141 --> 01:16:44,434
- I really love this movie.

2036
01:16:44,559 --> 01:16:45,560
I hope
that everyone will like it,

2037
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:47,145
because we had fun making it,
and I think it's really good.

2038
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:48,354
- I hope so, too.

2039
01:16:48,646 --> 01:16:49,897
I hope it's a huge hit for you
and for David Spade

2040
01:16:50,023 --> 01:16:51,357
and everybody else as well.

2041
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:52,483
- Because if I don't,

2042
01:16:52,609 --> 01:16:53,985
I'm going back
to Wisconsin on the farm,

2043
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:55,153
so go to it!

2044
01:16:55,612 --> 01:16:56,988
No, no, that was stupid too.

2045
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:58,156
I shouldn't have...

2046
01:16:58,281 --> 01:16:59,281
- [laughs]

2047
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:00,617
- Chris was at a place,

2048
01:17:00,742 --> 01:17:02,702
not that he didn't need
SNL at that point,

2049
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:03,827
because it feels

2050
01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:05,622
like it just had kind of
run its course.

2051
01:17:05,747 --> 01:17:06,748
- Once you're on the show

2052
01:17:06,873 --> 01:17:09,626
and then you're in a movie
that does really, really well,

2053
01:17:09,751 --> 01:17:11,753
it's weird being on the show.

2054
01:17:13,838 --> 01:17:15,958
It's not like you think
you're better than the show...

2055
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:17,216
never, of course.

2056
01:17:17,759 --> 01:17:19,677
The movies are a lot of work.

2057
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:22,430
The love you get
for what you've done

2058
01:17:22,764 --> 01:17:23,931
lasts for years,

2059
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:26,466
and on Saturday Night Live,
it's gone by Sunday morning.

2060
01:17:26,476 --> 01:17:27,518
- For Chris,

2061
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:30,813
the pull of Hollywood
was now very strong.

2062
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:33,983
A new administration
came in at NBC.

2063
01:17:34,442 --> 01:17:36,444
I think they did not like him.

2064
01:17:36,736 --> 01:17:38,905
They did not like Adam Sandler.

2065
01:17:39,113 --> 01:17:43,076
It was a generational change.

2066
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:47,205
- What happens
after SNL is scary, man,

2067
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:49,082
and you don't want it to end.

2068
01:17:49,207 --> 01:17:50,708
I remember the last party,

2069
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,502
looking at each other
and being like,

2070
01:17:52,627 --> 01:17:55,880
"This is it, man?
This is over, that great run?

2071
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:57,382
Now what?"

2072
01:17:57,799 --> 01:17:58,758
- From my own experience
being on the show,

2073
01:17:58,883 --> 01:18:00,635
you always wanted,
like, to be on the show

2074
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:03,179
and then have a movie out
that was a hit

2075
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:04,305
at the same time,

2076
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,140
and so if they don't do well,

2077
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:07,725
you think, "Well, at least
I still have the show,"

2078
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:09,560
"so I'm not, like,
completely out of it."

2079
01:18:09,686 --> 01:18:12,605
- And he was getting big offers
to do stuff,

2080
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:14,774
big money,
they had big directors,

2081
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:16,192
everybody loved him.

2082
01:18:16,317 --> 01:18:17,735
So he had stuff to do,

2083
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:21,614
but there's that fear of,
like, "What the hell am I doing?"

2084
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:23,574
"Why am I going
to be out on my own?"

2085
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:24,617
because there,
you're a team together,

2086
01:18:24,742 --> 01:18:27,161
then all of a sudden,
it's all you.

2087
01:18:28,121 --> 01:18:29,622
- He said, "Kitten..."

2088
01:18:30,123 --> 01:18:32,291
"I only saw myself
doing Saturday Night Live."

2089
01:18:32,417 --> 01:18:35,169
"Like, that was my goal,
was to do Saturday Night Live"

2090
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:37,046
"and make my father laugh."

2091
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,882
"I never imagined myself
doing movies."

2092
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:41,509
And I said, "Oh, no..."

2093
01:18:42,552 --> 01:18:44,345
"It's not in his comfort zone,"

2094
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:46,305
and when
you don't get in your...

2095
01:18:46,431 --> 01:18:47,765
you're past your comfort zone,

2096
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:49,767
you've got to make sure
you're really grounded.

2097
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:52,729
Otherwise,
it can just be overwhelming.

2098
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:57,483
- He was a giant TV star,
a giant movie star,

2099
01:18:57,608 --> 01:18:59,193
but the kind of routine

2100
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:00,932
of having the show
and the family

2101
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:03,656
and the same people and Lorne
and all his "brothers,"

2102
01:19:03,781 --> 01:19:06,200
and without that,
it wasn't the same.

2103
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:07,368
I mean,

2104
01:19:07,869 --> 01:19:09,909
it might have made him feel
like he was floundering,

2105
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:12,165
like there wasn't the safety
of the show,

2106
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:15,877
the security of that set...
family atmosphere.

2107
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:23,176
- Hi, ma'am.

2108
01:19:25,136 --> 01:19:25,970
Vote for Donnelly.

2109
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:28,097
- Tommy Boy's a movie
that stayed with people,

2110
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:29,974
and then what happens
is the studio is sort of like,

2111
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:31,851
"We're going to try
to replicate that."

2112
01:19:31,976 --> 01:19:33,686
"We're going to try
to grab whatever Tommy Boy had"

2113
01:19:33,811 --> 01:19:35,646
"and make it that again,"
you know,

2114
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:36,773
and I get that.

2115
01:19:36,898 --> 01:19:39,650
- Paramount had an option on him
from Tommy Boy,

2116
01:19:39,776 --> 01:19:40,818
and so he had to do Black Sheep.

2117
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:43,529
- Fred Wolf was 60 pages
into the script

2118
01:19:43,654 --> 01:19:44,739
when we were green-lit,

2119
01:19:44,864 --> 01:19:45,865
and I went,

2120
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:47,470
"We don't actually
have a script yet."

2121
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:48,694
- Listen, I think it's better

2122
01:19:48,743 --> 01:19:50,161
if we bring the energy
down a tad.

2123
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:51,496
- Are you kidding me?

2124
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:52,621
It's showmanship.

2125
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:53,539
You've got to go out
and get 'em.

2126
01:19:53,664 --> 01:19:54,664
- It was like Tommy Boy.

2127
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:55,541
We wanted to get back
and do that.

2128
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:56,501
He goes,
"That's the one people like,

2129
01:19:56,626 --> 01:19:57,752
and we should try it again."

2130
01:19:57,877 --> 01:19:59,754
Fred gave him
a rolling down a hill.

2131
01:19:59,879 --> 01:20:01,506
He'd just keep falling,
because it gets funnier

2132
01:20:01,631 --> 01:20:02,882
because it's so stupid.

2133
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:04,801
He's just very good at anything
you give him like that.

2134
01:20:04,926 --> 01:20:08,721
He can come up with, like,
jerky moves and funny faces,

2135
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:10,765
and he snaps his head around.

2136
01:20:11,599 --> 01:20:12,642
- Bunk beds.

2137
01:20:13,643 --> 01:20:15,061
I've got dibs on top.

2138
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:16,312
- Okay.

2139
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:17,519
- In the cabin with David,

2140
01:20:17,522 --> 01:20:19,774
or him
rolling down that hill, <i>or...</i>

2141
01:20:19,899 --> 01:20:22,318
There was
lots of really funny things.

2142
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:23,736
- Nothing's going
to stop us now.

2143
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:24,695
[engine fails to start]

2144
01:20:24,821 --> 01:20:25,738
- We knew there was a difference

2145
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:26,906
between Black Sheep
and Tommy Boy,

2146
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:28,574
and Chris knew that, too.

2147
01:20:28,699 --> 01:20:29,742
The process became interrupted.

2148
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:33,621
It just got to be manipulated
by people from outside.

2149
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:36,123
- Okay,
maybe we could use some help.

2150
01:20:36,249 --> 01:20:37,083
- The two pictures grossed

2151
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:39,126
almost exactly
the same amount of money,

2152
01:20:39,252 --> 01:20:42,755
so the fact that one vehicle
maybe was a little rushed

2153
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:46,467
and maybe not made as lovingly
as the first one was,

2154
01:20:46,926 --> 01:20:49,136
that's what you take away
when you're doing it.

2155
01:20:49,262 --> 01:20:50,382
- Chris was a perfectionist,

2156
01:20:50,388 --> 01:20:54,225
and he was always, you know,
he just wanted to do the best,

2157
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:56,591
and if it wasn't the best,
he was really hard on himself.

2158
01:20:56,644 --> 01:20:58,479
- Just because
things aren't perfect

2159
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:00,898
doesn't mean
people won't like them.

2160
01:21:01,023 --> 01:21:04,026
- Unfortunately,
I was with him when it...

2161
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:06,362
when it...

2162
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:08,364
when he relapsed the first time.

2163
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:09,532
And we were...

2164
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:12,660
He called me up, and he said,
"Do you want to go see...

2165
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:15,872
We're doing a preview show
of Black Sheep."

2166
01:21:16,956 --> 01:21:18,958
He was just getting nervous,
and he was upset,

2167
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:21,711
and to see it onscreen,
he was like...

2168
01:21:21,836 --> 01:21:23,963
it just was enough
to set him off.

2169
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:25,528
And the next day,
my Dad calls me up.

2170
01:21:25,631 --> 01:21:27,675
He was like,
"What happened last night?"

2171
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,000
It's like, "What do you mean?"

2172
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:30,932
It's like, "Christopher
trashed his hotel room,"

2173
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:34,724
"and, you know, he's back
in the, you know, rehab, and..."

2174
01:21:34,849 --> 01:21:35,850
It's like, holy shit.

2175
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:38,603
- So he went off the handle
for two weeks,

2176
01:21:38,728 --> 01:21:40,730
then they dragged him
back into rehab.

2177
01:21:40,855 --> 01:21:41,939
A couple more rehabs,

2178
01:21:42,064 --> 01:21:44,901
and then sober
for Beverly Hills Ninja.

2179
01:21:45,693 --> 01:21:46,903
- Here's the thing.

2180
01:21:47,028 --> 01:21:48,349
If you're a drug addict,
you know,

2181
01:21:48,446 --> 01:21:49,697
and an alcoholic,

2182
01:21:49,864 --> 01:21:51,282
all of a sudden you're sober,
you're sober today.

2183
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:52,575
Like, it's a day.

2184
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:53,784
"I'm sober.
Oh, look at me, I'm sober."

2185
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:56,787
But if you're fat,
and I speak from experience...

2186
01:21:56,913 --> 01:21:57,914
you look in the mirror,

2187
01:21:58,039 --> 01:21:59,332
and you've eaten healthy
one day,

2188
01:21:59,457 --> 01:22:00,708
you're still fat.

2189
01:22:00,875 --> 01:22:02,877
You're like,
"How do I beat this thing?"

2190
01:22:03,002 --> 01:22:03,961
- I have always looked up to you,

2191
01:22:04,086 --> 01:22:05,922
and you have always
looked out for me,

2192
01:22:06,047 --> 01:22:07,847
but now it is time
that I look out for myself.

2193
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:09,717
- Be careful in your travels,
Haru.

2194
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:11,594
The world is a dangerous place.

2195
01:22:11,719 --> 01:22:12,929
[grunts]

2196
01:22:14,013 --> 01:22:15,573
- When I saw him,
and he was cleaned up,

2197
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:16,849
and he'd been to rehab
a couple times,

2198
01:22:16,974 --> 01:22:19,810
and he was refusing booze
at this party,

2199
01:22:20,061 --> 01:22:22,229
he was standing up for himself,

2200
01:22:23,022 --> 01:22:25,062
and he wasn't a kid going,
"What? What do you want?"

2201
01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:27,902
"Oh, yeah, cool, great,
whatever you've got I'll do"

2202
01:22:28,027 --> 01:22:30,780
"to make you happy,
to be a part of this."

2203
01:22:31,364 --> 01:22:34,200
He was saying,
"No, I need to protect myself."

2204
01:22:34,325 --> 01:22:37,912
- I think it's important
to just have a self-esteem

2205
01:22:38,955 --> 01:22:40,623
and believe in yourself

2206
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:43,376
and be able to tell the world...

2207
01:22:46,045 --> 01:22:48,965
I guess, "Go fuck yourself,"
on some level.

2208
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:53,970
It's a tough thing to deal with
that kind of fame

2209
01:22:54,095 --> 01:22:54,929
when you're that fam...

2210
01:22:55,054 --> 01:22:58,057
And if it happens fast,
it's almost lethal

2211
01:22:59,058 --> 01:23:00,810
if you don't really have
a firm belief

2212
01:23:00,935 --> 01:23:02,478
in what you are
and what you're doing.

2213
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:03,938
- It's sad to me, though,

2214
01:23:04,063 --> 01:23:05,982
that he didn't love himself

2215
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:08,275
as much as everybody around him
loved him.

2216
01:23:08,401 --> 01:23:12,571
- He went through 17 rehabs,
but he was a committed athlete.

2217
01:23:13,072 --> 01:23:16,409
He was not going
to let this addiction beat him.

2218
01:23:16,951 --> 01:23:17,952
- I would love

2219
01:23:18,077 --> 01:23:20,204
when he'd come back
from any rehab

2220
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:21,998
and be fresh and be like,

2221
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:24,375
"I'm done with that,"

2222
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:27,211
and he had his eating
under control,

2223
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:28,921
and he was excited.

2224
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:31,716
He was excited
to have that new shot.

2225
01:23:32,133 --> 01:23:35,553
- Chris sober was the most
brilliant, brightest thing

2226
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:37,013
I'd ever seen in my life.

2227
01:23:37,138 --> 01:23:38,097
To this day,
nothing's come close.

2228
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:40,683
- You can't walk around
being funny all the time.

2229
01:23:40,808 --> 01:23:42,129
You have to be yourself
sometimes,

2230
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:44,020
and you have to be alone
sometimes.

2231
01:23:44,145 --> 01:23:46,022
You can't be on stage
all the time.

2232
01:23:46,147 --> 01:23:48,816
- I think when Fatty falls down,
everybody goes home happy.

2233
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:50,860
It's easier than dialogue.

2234
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:52,778
I don't have much brain.

2235
01:23:53,237 --> 01:23:56,032
- But Chris also had
such a terrible self-image.

2236
01:23:56,157 --> 01:23:57,491
"Fatty fall down,"

2237
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,869
and "I'm just an idiot."

2238
01:24:00,077 --> 01:24:02,078
And everyone around him
would go, "No, you're not."

2239
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:04,832
"You're really smart,
and you're a great person,"

2240
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:06,375
and he'd go, "No, I'm not."

2241
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:07,334
- There's you, there's...

2242
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:08,502
[Crash]

2243
01:24:09,003 --> 01:24:10,254
Whoops-a-daisy.

2244
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:12,548
By god, whoops-a-daisy.

2245
01:24:13,049 --> 01:24:17,011
- It's interesting when people
put out an image of themself

2246
01:24:17,136 --> 01:24:20,139
and then in some way
have to live that life.

2247
01:24:22,266 --> 01:24:24,143
People want that, expect that,

2248
01:24:24,268 --> 01:24:26,687
and if you don't get
to go offstage

2249
01:24:27,271 --> 01:24:29,440
and somehow restore yourself,

2250
01:24:30,024 --> 01:24:31,358
the pull of it <i>is...</i>

2251
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:34,528
you know, the flame,

2252
01:24:35,029 --> 01:24:37,240
and you can get burned
to a crisp.

2253
01:24:37,364 --> 01:24:38,885
- And now,
here with another commentary

2254
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:40,431
is Update commentator
Bennett Brauer.

2255
01:24:40,534 --> 01:24:41,534
Bennett?

2256
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:43,245
[applause]

2257
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:48,417
- He had a big appetite...

2258
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:49,919
a big appetite for life,

2259
01:24:50,044 --> 01:24:51,462
for food, for drink,

2260
01:24:51,879 --> 01:24:53,047
for late nights,

2261
01:24:54,131 --> 01:24:56,092
for the pleasures of the earth.

2262
01:24:56,217 --> 01:24:58,469
- Well, maybe I'm not "the norm."

2263
01:24:59,762 --> 01:25:01,764
I'm not "camera-friendly."

2264
01:25:02,306 --> 01:25:04,809
I don't "wear clothes
that fit me."

2265
01:25:05,101 --> 01:25:07,019
- You know, he sincerely wanted
to be sober,

2266
01:25:07,144 --> 01:25:09,563
and was sober
for periods of time,

2267
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:10,773
and...

2268
01:25:11,065 --> 01:25:12,775
but I always said,
"You can't be fat, super-fat,"

2269
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:14,151
"and a drug addict."

2270
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:15,319
"You've got to pick one."

2271
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:18,781
- I'm not "hygienic."
I don't "wipe properly."

2272
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,324
I lack "style."

2273
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:23,828
I have no "charisma"
or "self-esteem."

2274
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:27,456
- Something was, was... amiss.

2275
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:30,126
Something wasn't working.

2276
01:25:30,251 --> 01:25:31,752
- You know, everyone's going
to do what they're going to do.

2277
01:25:31,877 --> 01:25:32,878
That's the problem.

2278
01:25:33,003 --> 01:25:34,672
There's only so much you can do.

2279
01:25:34,797 --> 01:25:35,756
- I mean,
I'll be honest with you.

2280
01:25:35,881 --> 01:25:36,799
There was something going on
in college.

2281
01:25:36,924 --> 01:25:38,551
That shit
doesn't just creep up on you.

2282
01:25:38,676 --> 01:25:40,177
I mean, I guess
it does creep up on you, but...

2283
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:42,012
- Alcohol probably being
his first love,

2284
01:25:42,138 --> 01:25:43,973
but he wasn't, you know...

2285
01:25:44,306 --> 01:25:46,267
the other stuff
wasn't far behind.

2286
01:25:48,144 --> 01:25:50,646
- You know,
an addictive person...

2287
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:54,400
I mean, it's a conundrum.

2288
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,819
- I don't "own a toothbrush"

2289
01:25:57,361 --> 01:25:58,946
or "let my scabs heal."

2290
01:26:00,531 --> 01:26:03,367
I can't "reach
all the parts of my body."

2291
01:26:04,285 --> 01:26:05,285
[audience laughs]

2292
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:07,788
- There was something
about him that...

2293
01:26:07,913 --> 01:26:09,290
He was just...
I don't know.

2294
01:26:09,415 --> 01:26:11,750
He was in deep,
a hard place to be.

2295
01:26:12,168 --> 01:26:14,003
All of us knew, every time.

2296
01:26:14,295 --> 01:26:16,338
His hair looked different.
He looked sweaty.

2297
01:26:16,463 --> 01:26:18,549
He looked...
His eyes were different.

2298
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:19,925
They were just...

2299
01:26:20,259 --> 01:26:22,094
You were like, "Oh, shit."

2300
01:26:23,304 --> 01:26:25,055
It was rough seeing him
like that,

2301
01:26:25,181 --> 01:26:26,223
and I hated it.

2302
01:26:26,807 --> 01:26:28,017
- Thank you, Kevin.

2303
01:26:28,142 --> 01:26:29,351
- Bennett Brauer,
ladies and gentlemen.

2304
01:26:29,476 --> 01:26:31,145
- Thank you.

2305
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:35,733
- I knew he was in trouble.

2306
01:26:35,858 --> 01:26:37,193
People would call me,

2307
01:26:37,318 --> 01:26:39,862
and I thought
the thing he loved the most

2308
01:26:39,987 --> 01:26:41,155
was doing the show.

2309
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,949
He never found the thing
that was as powerful.

2310
01:26:44,074 --> 01:26:45,117
[laughter]

2311
01:26:45,284 --> 01:26:47,036
- Timmy, come back.
Come back. Come back.

2312
01:26:47,161 --> 01:26:49,288
I mean,
I'm not the host tonight,

2313
01:26:49,413 --> 01:26:51,790
and Timmy damn sure
ain't the host tonight.

2314
01:26:51,916 --> 01:26:52,958
[laughing]

2315
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:55,127
No, the host tonight

2316
01:26:55,252 --> 01:26:57,588
is our good friend,
Chris Farley.

2317
01:26:57,713 --> 01:26:58,713
Come on, Chris.

2318
01:26:58,797 --> 01:26:59,840
[applause]

2319
01:27:00,007 --> 01:27:01,050
- Here we go!

2320
01:27:01,217 --> 01:27:03,010
- Let's do it!
- Let's do it!

2321
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:04,261
- Whatever shape he was in,

2322
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:06,513
coming back
and making him go through it

2323
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:08,265
to realize, if nothing else,

2324
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:10,100
this is what's happened to you,
you know...

2325
01:27:10,226 --> 01:27:12,061
that thing you're losing,

2326
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:15,272
that ability to be able
to still play the game,

2327
01:27:15,397 --> 01:27:16,857
which you were an all-star at.

2328
01:27:16,982 --> 01:27:18,275
- You know what I've learned?

2329
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,611
I've learned lessons
about responsibee...

2330
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:21,987
Responsibility.

2331
01:27:22,446 --> 01:27:25,115
Being responsible,
not only to myself,

2332
01:27:25,241 --> 01:27:26,617
but to the people around me.

2333
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:28,160
That means you guys.

2334
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:30,454
I think it's time
to quit goofing around.

2335
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:32,539
I think it's time
to grow up, fellas.

2336
01:27:32,665 --> 01:27:33,999
I want you...
everything's going to be okay.

2337
01:27:34,124 --> 01:27:35,334
- All right, man.
- Okay.

2338
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:37,378
- I'm a new Chris, okay, fellas?

2339
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:40,297
Now, stay,
we've got a great show tonight.

2340
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:42,758
Mighty Mighty Bosstones
are here,

2341
01:27:42,883 --> 01:27:44,051
so stick around.

2342
01:27:45,135 --> 01:27:48,264
- It's just rare
that a person has that much joy

2343
01:27:48,389 --> 01:27:51,767
and brings that much happiness
to everyone around them,

2344
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:53,143
but with Chris...

2345
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:57,398
there's a limit
to how wonderful it is to me.

2346
01:27:59,650 --> 01:28:00,650
And that limit

2347
01:28:00,651 --> 01:28:04,154
is when you kill yourself
with drugs and alcohol.

2348
01:28:04,571 --> 01:28:05,614
You know?

2349
01:28:05,823 --> 01:28:09,285
That's where it stops
being so fucking magical.

2350
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:13,372
- Things are getting better
and better for you, aren't they?

2351
01:28:13,497 --> 01:28:14,540
- Yeah.

2352
01:28:14,915 --> 01:28:15,958
<i>I...</i> I <i>love it.</i>

2353
01:28:17,334 --> 01:28:19,169
- Success in show business

2354
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:22,798
does not always create
the best version of people.

2355
01:28:22,923 --> 01:28:25,134
- Do you get a sense now
of how your life might change

2356
01:28:25,259 --> 01:28:26,760
with the fame
that is going to come

2357
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:28,086
with the release of this film?

2358
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:29,513
Not that you're not famous now,

2359
01:28:29,638 --> 01:28:31,515
but, you know,
it's going to be more and more.

2360
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:32,640
- And also thinking

2361
01:28:32,683 --> 01:28:34,643
that you have the physical
capacity to handle it,

2362
01:28:34,768 --> 01:28:36,603
because, you know, you may think
that you can handle it.

2363
01:28:36,729 --> 01:28:38,230
- It's not going to change me.
Going to be the same old Chris.

2364
01:28:38,355 --> 01:28:39,690
- Yeah.
- Nothing's going to happen...

2365
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:40,815
-om

2366
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:42,026
- Are you going to be okay?

2367
01:28:42,151 --> 01:28:43,819
- Yeah, I thought that...

2368
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:58,334
- Maybe this was the life
that he was supposed to live.

2369
01:28:58,459 --> 01:29:00,711
I mean, I'm selfish.
I wanted more.

2370
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:03,422
- You don't really believe it
when you're going through it.

2371
01:29:03,547 --> 01:29:04,798
You just think...

2372
01:29:05,424 --> 01:29:07,384
that he'd be able
to pull it out.

2373
01:29:07,509 --> 01:29:09,270
- "You're going to die
from that shit, buddy."

2374
01:29:09,303 --> 01:29:11,013
"You've got to stop,
you've got to stop,"

2375
01:29:11,138 --> 01:29:13,098
"and it's just not going
to end right,"

2376
01:29:13,223 --> 01:29:14,475
and then... it...

2377
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:17,394
[static]

2378
01:29:17,519 --> 01:29:19,605
- The entertainment world
has lost a huge talent,

2379
01:29:19,730 --> 01:29:20,981
and much too soon.

2380
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:24,360
Comedian Chris Farley
died today in Chicago.

2381
01:29:32,242 --> 01:29:33,577
- I wasn't shocked.

2382
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:37,206
And I was very sad,
and straight <i>up...</i>

2383
01:29:38,791 --> 01:29:39,833
[sighs]

2384
01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:43,128
Lots of things you wish
didn't happen, you know?

2385
01:29:43,253 --> 01:29:45,005
- You know, he died alone,

2386
01:29:46,882 --> 01:29:48,467
you know, on a linoleum floor.

2387
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:50,761
It was
not what we wanted for him,

2388
01:29:50,886 --> 01:29:53,055
nor what he wanted for himself.

2389
01:29:53,889 --> 01:29:55,057
- Nobody died...

2390
01:29:55,641 --> 01:29:57,059
You know, you're 33.

2391
01:29:57,476 --> 01:29:58,811
You don't die at 33.

2392
01:29:58,936 --> 01:30:00,270
It doesn't happen.

2393
01:30:00,521 --> 01:30:02,022
- It took months to go,

2394
01:30:02,689 --> 01:30:04,900
"Okay, I can talk about this,
or I could just..."

2395
01:30:05,025 --> 01:30:06,068
Too much.

2396
01:30:06,485 --> 01:30:09,279
It comes up in something
in my mind every day,

2397
01:30:09,405 --> 01:30:11,323
and I think it will forever.

2398
01:30:11,657 --> 01:30:13,742
- I liked having him in my life.
It was better.

2399
01:30:13,867 --> 01:30:16,495
It made my life better
being a friend of mine.

2400
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:24,169
- Do I wish
I could clone that guy?

2401
01:30:24,294 --> 01:30:25,575
But with Chris,
you just don't...

2402
01:30:25,629 --> 01:30:27,089
When they say,
"God made the mold"

2403
01:30:27,214 --> 01:30:28,535
"and he threw it out the window,"

2404
01:30:28,632 --> 01:30:29,800
there was no mold.

2405
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:31,176
There was just...

2406
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:33,387
It was just ether, stars,
comets,

2407
01:30:33,512 --> 01:30:35,514
precious jewels and gems...

2408
01:30:35,806 --> 01:30:37,683
and Chris.

2409
01:30:40,394 --> 01:30:42,020
- Thank you, folks.
You guys have been great.

2410
01:30:42,146 --> 01:30:43,480
Thank you for coming out.

2411
01:30:43,605 --> 01:30:46,150
- Keep it going for Kevin Farley,
everybody.

2412
01:30:46,275 --> 01:30:47,317
[cheering]

2413
01:30:47,651 --> 01:30:49,403
- Chris, he would never want
to bring any sadness.

2414
01:30:49,528 --> 01:30:51,488
What he would want
is just everybody to laugh

2415
01:30:51,613 --> 01:30:52,781
and don't be sad.

2416
01:30:53,574 --> 01:30:55,325
Keep the laughter going.

2417
01:30:55,451 --> 01:30:57,369
- It's called a clown's prayer.

2418
01:30:57,494 --> 01:30:58,815
Before any audition
at Second City

2419
01:30:58,829 --> 01:30:59,997
or for TV or film,

2420
01:31:00,497 --> 01:31:02,458
we'd always take out the prayer.

2421
01:31:02,583 --> 01:31:03,625
We'd read it.

2422
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:07,337
I actually still have
the prayer in my wallet, um...

2423
01:31:07,463 --> 01:31:09,089
I usually don't read prayers,
but I will.

2424
01:31:09,214 --> 01:31:11,049
I mean, I do, but not for...

2425
01:31:11,717 --> 01:31:12,759
All right.

2426
01:31:13,552 --> 01:31:16,180
"Dear Lord, as I stumble
through this life,"

2427
01:31:16,305 --> 01:31:18,515
"help me to create more laughter
than tears,"

2428
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:20,476
"dispense more happiness
than gloom,"

2429
01:31:20,601 --> 01:31:22,769
"spread more cheer
than despair."

2430
01:31:22,895 --> 01:31:25,314
"Never let me become so blase
that I will fail to see"

2431
01:31:25,439 --> 01:31:27,316
"the wonder
in the eyes of a child"

2432
01:31:27,441 --> 01:31:29,776
"or a twinkle
in the eyes of the aged."

2433
01:31:29,902 --> 01:31:32,404
"Never let me forget that my work
is to cheer people,"

2434
01:31:32,529 --> 01:31:35,199
"make them happy,
and make them laugh."

2435
01:31:35,491 --> 01:31:37,451
"Never let me acquire success
to the point"

2436
01:31:37,576 --> 01:31:39,786
"where I discontinue
calling on my Creator"

2437
01:31:39,912 --> 01:31:41,247
"in the hour of need,"

2438
01:31:41,413 --> 01:31:42,581
"and acknowledging Him
and thanking Him"

2439
01:31:42,706 --> 01:31:44,208
"in the hour of plenty."

2440
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:47,419
"And in my final moment,
may I hear you whisper,"

2441
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:50,380
" 'When you made my people smile,
you made me smile.' "

2442
01:31:50,506 --> 01:31:51,590
- Chris Farley.

2443
01:31:51,757 --> 01:31:52,799
- Whoo!

2444
01:31:52,966 --> 01:31:54,801
-[music] You came into the world [music]

2445
01:31:55,719 --> 01:31:58,055
[music] The day
that all the kings died [music]

2446
01:31:59,473 --> 01:32:01,642
[music] I felt the heat
in your heart [music]

2447
01:32:03,227 --> 01:32:05,312
[music] Saw the flames
in your eyes [music]

2448
01:32:06,772 --> 01:32:09,191
[music] For three days
and three nights [music]

2449
01:32:10,651 --> 01:32:12,903
[music] You didn't sleep
or even tire [music]

2450
01:32:14,446 --> 01:32:16,865
[music] Yeah,
you're gonna burn bright [music]

2451
01:32:18,116 --> 01:32:20,285
[music] 'Cause you were born
on fire [music]

2452
01:32:22,162 --> 01:32:23,497
[music] Don't let nobody [music]

2453
01:32:25,374 --> 01:32:27,209
[music] Try to dampen your flame [music]

2454
01:32:28,961 --> 01:32:30,462
[music] Try to cool you down [music]

2455
01:32:32,714 --> 01:32:34,382
[music] Try to make you change [music]

2456
01:32:36,426 --> 01:32:38,094
[music] Try to steal your heat [music]

2457
01:32:40,097 --> 01:32:41,598
[music] Or mock your desire [music]

2458
01:32:43,684 --> 01:32:46,019
[music] Take your flames
to the street [music]

2459
01:32:47,521 --> 01:32:49,690
[music] 'Cause you were born
on fire [music]

2460
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:55,279
[music] Saw you playing
in the ozone [music]

2461
01:32:56,697 --> 01:32:58,699
[music] Jumping on your
time bombs [music]

2462
01:33:00,742 --> 01:33:03,245
[music] Skipping through
the land mines [music]

2463
01:33:03,579 --> 01:33:05,080
[music] Made to cut you down [music]

2464
01:33:07,583 --> 01:33:08,703
[music] Cut you down [music]

2465
01:33:11,128 --> 01:33:15,132
[music] Laid to cut you down [music]

2466
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:19,344
[music] Well, I seen you bleed [music]

2467
01:33:21,305 --> 01:33:22,889
[music] And I seen you bruise [music]

2468
01:33:24,975 --> 01:33:26,393
[music] And I seen you rage [music]

2469
01:33:28,812 --> 01:33:30,480
[music] And I've seen you blue [music]

2470
01:33:32,649 --> 01:33:34,901
[music] But that don't
break my heart [music]

2471
01:33:36,403 --> 01:33:38,739
[music] Like when you
look me in the eye [music]

2472
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:42,034
[music] And you ask me questions [music]

2473
01:33:43,827 --> 01:33:46,246
[music] Like where we going
when we die? [music]

2474
01:33:48,332 --> 01:33:50,167
[music] Then who you gonna love? [music]

2475
01:33:52,085 --> 01:33:53,837
[music] And how you gonna live? [music]

2476
01:33:55,422 --> 01:33:57,257
[music] And will you
be a poor one [music]

2477
01:33:59,134 --> 01:34:01,053
[music] Or could I leave you rich?
[music]

2478
01:34:02,679 --> 01:34:04,598
[music] I can't leave
you no money [music]

2479
01:34:06,808 --> 01:34:08,644
[music] I can't leave
you no land [music]

2480
01:34:10,479 --> 01:34:12,397
[music] I can't leave
you no faith [music]

2481
01:34:14,232 --> 01:34:15,901
[music] I lost the little I had [music]

2482
01:34:17,736 --> 01:34:20,155
[music] Well, I can leave you
this truth [music]

2483
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:23,659
[music] Hold on to hope
and desire [music]

2484
01:34:25,494 --> 01:34:28,163

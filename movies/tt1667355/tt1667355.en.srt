1
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:20,759
It was clear.
Only one of us would survive.

2
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,343
And at the end it was me.

3
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,880
Not him.

4
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,054
Please, can you help me!
I've been kidnapped.

5
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:09,631
My name is Natascha Kampusch.

6
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,412
3096 Days.

7
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,752
This is my daughter.

8
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,295
Okay, Everyone.

9
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:54,062
We're not going to be this young again!

10
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:56,214
Cheers!

11
00:02:57,467 --> 00:02:58,214
I love you.

12
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,925
Dad, we have to go, you promised
mommy you take me back by eight.

13
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,177
We'll go in a minute, my darling.

14
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,335
And then the man says:
…I've already got her!

15
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,380
Natascha!

16
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,507
Natascha, it's time to get up!

17
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,506
I'm not telling you again.

18
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:46,251
I put the dress out for you.
Do I have to wear it?

19
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:48,636
Have you got any idea how
long I've worked on that?

20
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:52,963
Other girl would be happy if their
mothers made them such nice dresses.

21
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:57,961
It's nice, but it makes me look fat.
Then don't eat so many biscuits.

22
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,794
What's taking you so long?

23
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,927
I've got to go to work!

24
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,798
He took to that bar again?

25
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,477
A child has no business in a bar.

26
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,610
If he brings you home late once more
It'll be the last time you go to see him.

27
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:53,300
Stop it! Leave me alone,
we weren't in the bar.

28
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:01,715
Pumpkin, I'm sorry!

29
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,256
Don't be like that...

30
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,547
Help!

31
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,130
Hello?

32
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,255
Hello!

33
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:34,464
Is there anybody there?

34
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,172
Get up!

35
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,630
Stand back.

36
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:05,464
Take off your shoes.

37
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,131
I want to go to my mommy...

38
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,005
Help!

39
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:02,089
Help!

40
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,297
Help!

41
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,255
Help!

42
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:04,714
Mommy...

43
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,297
Mommy?

44
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,297
Day 3.

45
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,475
And the prince...

46
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,755
the prince wanted to marry a princess.

47
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,874
But she had to be a real princess.

48
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,263
And the prince wanted to marry a princess.

49
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:09,420
But she had to be a real princess.

50
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:15,261
One evening there was a
knock on the palace gates.

51
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,630
Go ahead, have one.

52
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:38,059
The aged Queen thought to herself,
we will put that to the test...

53
00:14:38,158 --> 00:14:41,633
and place a pea at the bottom of the bed.

54
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,962
And she stacked twenty
mattresses on top of the pea

55
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,844
and then twenty blankets on top of them.

56
00:14:50,292 --> 00:14:54,468
The next morning the princess
was asked how she had slept.

57
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,836
And she cried out: It was awful.

58
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:03,510
I was lying on something hard,
and now I'm black and Blue all over.

59
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:08,876
The prince then took her as his wife,

60
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,802
because now he knew he
had found his princess.

61
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,422
So.

62
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,797
The End.

63
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,422
Thank you...

64
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:45,178
Are you going?
Are you going far away?

65
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:49,964
Wait!

66
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:53,761
Will you give me a kiss goodnight?

67
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,712
My Mom always gives me
a goodnight kiss...

68
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,617
10 year old Natascha is still
missing, for the past week

69
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,382
several hundred police officers
have been scarring the area

70
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:41,783
since she vanished the
morning of the 2nd of March.

71
00:16:41,796 --> 00:16:44,048
Despite their tireless efforts

72
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,551
search teams have still failed
to find any trace of her.

73
00:16:46,564 --> 00:16:48,918
Natascha's mother has
been quoted as saying,

74
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:53,088
I have lost all hope.
How could you say that?

75
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:57,251
I didn't, Mother.
They write whatever they want.

76
00:16:57,667 --> 00:17:00,033
The police diving unit
has also been used to

77
00:17:00,046 --> 00:17:02,423
search several lakes
in the immediate area.

78
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:06,209
Thank God Natascha wasn't down there.

79
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:10,884
So far Natascha remains missing
without a trace... and now to sports...

80
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:16,922
"“Stop it, leave me alone...
Help! Help!"

81
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:19,670
One, two...

82
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,756
Pumpkin, I'm sorry!
Don't be like that...

83
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,755
Five, six.

84
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:36,037
One, two, three, four…

85
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:48,844
One, two, three, four.

86
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:53,636
One, two, three.

87
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,963
“I have to count the days.”
Four, five, six.

88
00:17:58,817 --> 00:18:02,091
One, two, three... what time is it?

89
00:18:08,817 --> 00:18:11,291
This should do you for next week.

90
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:15,547
Beef casserole and red cabbage.

91
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,802
Mashed peas and carrots.

92
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:21,930
You can have in one day,
and one in the next.

93
00:18:21,943 --> 00:18:23,842
That should keep you
going till Wednesday.

94
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,672
All right.

95
00:18:27,792 --> 00:18:29,385
And potato salad.

96
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:33,132
But with no mayonnaise
so you can warm it through.

97
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,280
Well I could even have
it with the red cabbage.

98
00:18:35,293 --> 00:18:37,209
Like a vegetarian.

99
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,005
A vegetarian?

100
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,594
So... your favorite cold meat salad.

101
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,129
And lots of turnips and onions,
as you've always liked it.

102
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,926
But you have to eat it soon. Well let's
eat it now mother. The two of us.

103
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,674
What have you done now?
What makes you say that?

104
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:14,218
Fears are growing that Natascha
has been abducted.

105
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:19,181
Her kidnapper was probably hiding waiting
her to get to school shown here on the map.

106
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,124
Much of the information given by the...

107
00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:25,964
So that pervert is sexually
abusing that child.

108
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,022
Why else would he ever abduct her?

109
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,799
Who knows?
Maybe he's crazy mother.

110
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:45,717
I wrote my parents so they don't worry.

111
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:47,919
Can you send it to them?

112
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,547
<i>Take off your t-shirt.</i>

113
00:20:15,698 --> 00:20:16,198
Shampoo.

114
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,794
Not too much!
You have any idea how this stuff costs?

115
00:20:23,042 --> 00:20:26,046
Good for nothing.
Then let me go.

116
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,578
Oh, nobody wants you.
My parents do want me.

117
00:20:28,688 --> 00:20:32,212
Really?
Then why aren't they paying the ransom?

118
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:36,295
They don't care about you.
That's not true!

119
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,462
Really, well don't believe it then.
But nobody is paying anything for you.

120
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:42,198
They don't have money, why
didn't you pick a rich family?

121
00:20:42,267 --> 00:20:44,798
Well your parents just
have to go to the bank?

122
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,188
That's all they have to do!

123
00:20:46,258 --> 00:20:49,088
Every bank shows up money for kidnappings!

124
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,834
They don't care about you!
Because you're not worth it to them!

125
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:56,296
That's not true!
Yes, it is. Is true!

126
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,220
Come here!
Let's clean that hair.

127
00:21:00,775 --> 00:21:02,377
Don't cry.

128
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:07,047
I said stop crying!
Would you stop?

129
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,469
Look at me.
Stop crying!

130
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:12,339
Stop crying!

131
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,219
I can't stand whining!
Stop it.

132
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,502
Shut up! Shut up!

133
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,173
I can't stand tears!

134
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,047
Shut up! Shut up!

135
00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:28,885
Stop it!

136
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,044
The mess you made.

137
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,302
Look at me. Look at me!

138
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,219
You're gonna clean it all up.

139
00:24:14,092 --> 00:24:15,167
Grandma...

140
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:21,674
Let's more coffee?
Well. I've had enough.

141
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,631
Mama?
Please.

142
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:30,551
Sorry.

143
00:24:31,217 --> 00:24:33,951
You don't know why you
still can't get a job.

144
00:24:34,042 --> 00:24:37,376
<i>- What?
- I said, he still can't get a job!</i>

145
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:38,530
Mother...

146
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:53,302
Sorry.
I was in the back garden.

147
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:56,294
<i>- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.</i>

148
00:24:56,583 --> 00:25:00,258
Are you the owner of this van?
Yep, what is it?

149
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:03,045
Can we have a look at it?
Yes...

150
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:06,925
What's this all about?
Would you mind open it, please Sir?

151
00:25:07,042 --> 00:25:10,114
Oh I heard you were
looking for a white van?

152
00:25:10,127 --> 00:25:13,209
Is it about that girl?

153
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:14,973
Natascha Kampusch?, Wasn't that her name?

154
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:16,803
Do you know anything about it?

155
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,176
I just heard the TV you were looking for
a white van with tinted windows.

156
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,551
So, I thought someone
might come by. You

157
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,793
wouldn't believe the
number we've looked at.

158
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,209
I can imagine, yes.
Why do you keep all your blinds down?

159
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:33,459
Is a habit.
So, can you open it, please?

160
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:35,548
Of course. Excuse me...

161
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:43,172
<i>- I use it for work, building work.</i>

162
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:50,210
What kind of work do you do?
Telecommunications. I am a technician.

163
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:53,302
And who do you work?
Sorry?

164
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:55,548
Who do you work for?

165
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:58,880
Siemens!

166
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:03,346
Well, I did.
At the moment I am unemployed...

167
00:26:05,017 --> 00:26:06,076
So live here then.

168
00:26:08,092 --> 00:26:09,751
I've got to ask you this.

169
00:26:10,292 --> 00:26:13,001
Where were you on the 2nd of March?
Between 7 and 8 AM?

170
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:16,755
2nd of March?

171
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:23,592
On 2nd of March...
Oh yes, I was here. I was at home.

172
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,506
Can anyone provide you with an alibi?
No, I was alone.

173
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:32,716
So you live on your own then?
Yes.

174
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:36,427
My mother and grandmother
just visit me. Would

175
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,044
you like some coffee?,
we have some cake?

176
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:41,961
Thanks, no. We got to be going.
But...

177
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,295
<i>- Bye.

178
00:26:46,067 --> 00:26:47,495
What do you think?

179
00:27:48,017 --> 00:27:49,464
It's all right

180
00:27:50,917 --> 00:27:51,864
I love you...

181
00:27:52,017 --> 00:27:56,264
Good Night Natascha...
Tuck up... sleep tight...

182
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:10,964
Good morning.

183
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:19,005
Is it morning?

184
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:27,086
How long am I gonna have to stay here?

185
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,048
Until your parents pay.

186
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:33,677
Can I have a clock? Please?

187
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,297
A clock?

188
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:43,880
If you're good.

189
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:47,422
Are you being good?

190
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:08,882
Did you send the letter to my parents?

191
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,047
Yes.

192
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:20,089
Stop looking.

193
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:27,630
What's that for?

194
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:33,042
So I can hear you upstairs.
And talk to you.

195
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:40,381
Are you alone up there too?

196
00:30:17,258 --> 00:30:21,005
Day 183.

197
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:26,005
Good morning.
Hello.

198
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:35,627
Natascha, we have class until ten.
Please pay attention.

199
00:30:37,042 --> 00:30:41,092
The Aar river, it has its
source in the Aar glacier.

200
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:43,214
Be quiet!

201
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:48,007
Flows through the Haslital valley

202

As well as lake Bienzer and Turin

204
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:59,292
<i>- How long is the Aar?
- 295 Kilometers.</i>

205
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:03,175
<i>- What was that?
- 295 Kilometers.</i>

206
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:05,672
That is correct.

207
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:10,626
Next is Aarestrup, Emil.

208
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:15,802
A Danish author close influenced by
the poetry of Heinrich Heine.

209
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:19,132
Heine, H. That's for later.

210
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,801
Miss Kampusch, how did you managed
to escape your kidnapper?

211
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:16,757
In the end I overpowered him.

212
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:21,548
How did you do that?
He was much bigger than you, wasn't he?

213
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:23,960
Yes, he...

214
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,844
I just overpowered him.

215
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,836
Did you brush your teeth before or
after you overpowered him?

216
00:32:32,042 --> 00:32:35,018
What was that? Answer me!

217
00:32:35,043 --> 00:32:37,247
Nothing. You scared me...

218
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:40,757
Did you brush your teeth?
Yes.

219
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:44,302
Did you rinse off your plate?

220
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:48,801
Yes.
You have to obey me.

221
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:52,927
Obey me.
Yes, I will.

222
00:32:53,292 --> 00:32:54,839
Obey me...

Obey me! Obey me!

226
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:06,336
Obey me! Obey me!

227
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,797
Obey me!

228
00:33:09,292 --> 00:33:11,260
Obey me! Obey me!

229
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:14,631
Obey me! Obey me!

230
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,922
I have something on my arm.

231
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:38,049
It really hurts! Is so bad, you
have to take me to a doctor...

232
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:43,298
It's really bad!

233
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:56,880
If you're gonna play with your food
You don't need any.

234
00:33:57,292 --> 00:33:59,036
You're too fat anyway.

235
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:00,236
HELP!

236
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:01,558
Nobody will find you.

237
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:04,506
You know where the shout goes!
Goes up to the roof. HELP!

238
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,531
No one can hear you or even can smell you.

239
00:34:06,585 --> 00:34:09,131
They'll have to put
sniffer dogs on the roof!

240
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:12,667
Come here, come here,
I want to show you something. Come on!

241
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:16,667
Look, there.
See that? See that door?

242
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:33,630
Look.

243
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:38,880
No. No.

244
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:42,755
No. No.

245
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:46,511
<i>- No.
- Let me go...</i>

246
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:56,003
Why would I do that after
Building you such a nice room?

247
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:21,715
Natascha, get...

248

“What I meant to say was...”

253
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,047
Are you there?

Could you bring me some sugar?
Natascha really likes something to eat.

258
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:54,922
Please...

259
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:59,130
Say something.

I haven't eaten in four days!

263
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:17,216
Do you want me to die or anything?

264
00:37:18,292 --> 00:37:21,842
Please, I have to eat something!
Anything!

265

Are you really that stupid?

288
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:30,509
You have to say “obey me”,
just as often I have to hear it.

289
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:36,878
I'm sorry...

Good morning.

00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:47,003
Can you sow this? It seems undone
and they are so expensive.

301
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:50,136
Hey. Hey!

302
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:54,255
Why are you sitting there?

303
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:57,172
I have my period.

304
00:40:58,417 --> 00:40:59,964
You...
You have your what?

305
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,922
My menses?

306
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,047
Already?

307
00:41:11,167 --> 00:41:13,261
Oh great, that too.

308
00:41:15,292 --> 00:41:18,216
Oh, this is disgusting!

309
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:21,127
This...
Look at that mess!

310
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:23,841
Clean it up!
I have to have a shower.

311
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,300
A shower? You just rinse it off!
Rinse it off! There!

312
00:41:29,208 --> 00:41:30,755
There!

313

I 'em making even bigger mess!

314
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:39,421
<i>You better do what I say,
don't give me any lip! - Yes.</i>

315
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:41,505
Wipe that smirk off your face!

316
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,797
Christ!

317
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:52,417
<i>- You must have a shower. Upstairs.
- Upstairs?</i>

318
00:41:54,292 --> 00:41:55,839
Upstairs...

319
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:00,880
There isn't any upstairs.

320
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:38,668
Don't move until I call you.
And don't get any ideas either.

321
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,969
I hold the doors and
windows secured with

322
00:42:41,982 --> 00:42:44,711
explosives, So if you
touch the wrong thing...

323
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:48,219
Boom!
Do you understand?

324
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,794
You can come up now.

325
00:43:52,292 --> 00:43:54,511
You just do what I tell you to.

326
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:58,962
You'll go ahead of me.
If you scream...

327
00:44:00,417 --> 00:44:01,964
I'll kill you.

328
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:48,048
What are you looking at?

329
00:45:06,792 --> 00:45:09,545
No!
You want to touch my towels?

330
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,005
Wash it out!

331
00:45:15,042 --> 00:45:16,885
You keep getting more hair.

332
00:45:17,292 --> 00:45:21,092
<i>Locking me up downstairs is not gonna
stop me from growing up... - What was that?</i>

333
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:46,880
Drink up.
Then I can put that in the dishwasher too.

334
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:54,171
And don't turn it on until it's full?

335
00:45:57,333 --> 00:45:58,880
Okay.

336
00:46:12,958 --> 00:46:14,505
Right then.

337
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:17,672
I'm off.

338
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:25,709
Have you got a girlfriend?

339
00:46:27,792 --> 00:46:30,011
Where do you get that idea?

340
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:32,881
Is she a blonde?

341
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,672
No...

342
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:38,423
No!
I'm glad.

343
00:46:39,167 --> 00:46:42,546
Grandmother was beginning to
worry that you were gay.

344
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:44,255
Nonsense!

345
00:46:48,542 --> 00:46:50,215
I know, son.

346
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:39,884
Wow, Christmas is upon us!
The year has flown by!

347
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:42,558
The shops are still open
for another three hours!

348
00:47:42,583 --> 00:47:45,544
So go out and grab those last few presents!

349
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:58,544
Day 1837.

350
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,128
<i>- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.</i>

351
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:37,627
Stop, that's for later,

352
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,460
Look at this.

353
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:43,255
Oh, wow.

354
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:45,672
With screen.

355
00:48:47,542 --> 00:48:49,089
Nice, hah?

356
00:48:49,917 --> 00:48:51,464
Nice...

357
00:48:56,792 --> 00:48:58,339
Ah, ah, ah.

358
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:00,339
Good. We'll see.

359
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:06,585
What… ah, again.
Merry Christmas.

360
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,297
<i>- For me? - Yes.
- Thank you!</i>

361
00:49:09,417 --> 00:49:10,964
Stop!

362
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,547
Well, this...

363
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:17,380
All right.

364
00:49:18,375 --> 00:49:19,922
Okay...

365
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:24,677
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it!

366
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:26,755
Yes...

367
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:33,500
Wow, a Walkman!

368
00:49:33,525 --> 00:49:35,711
Now I can listen to music in the dark!

369
00:49:35,917 --> 00:49:38,200
<i>- Thank you!
- But you have to be good, 'cause...</i>

370
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,314
<i>we don't want the batteries
to die so quickly this time.</i>

371
00:49:40,327 --> 00:49:42,426
<i>Of course, yeah. Thank you.</i>

372
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:45,505
Keep going.

373
00:49:54,750 --> 00:50:00,132
Jungle Book,
Treasure Island, Karl May.

374
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:03,422
Oh, wow...

375
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:06,839
Go on, read it.

376
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:14,503
The light of day is waning.
The hush of night is on its way.

377
00:50:16,583 --> 00:50:21,089
So for the hearts craving.
Can pass just like the day.

378
00:50:23,917 --> 00:50:25,590
This is so nice.

379
00:50:27,833 --> 00:50:29,380
Thank you...
Stop that!

380
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:43,131
This... it's Christmas...
And I cannot stop thinking about it...

381
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:50,010
I really like to know how my family is.
You don't have a family anymore.

382
00:50:50,167 --> 00:50:53,034
Do you understand? Because
I 'em your family! I'm

383
00:50:53,047 --> 00:50:55,924
your father, I'm your mother,
I'm your grandmother!

384
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:58,762
I'm everything to you!
Because I've created you.

385
00:50:58,775 --> 00:51:01,465
Your family is dead.

386
00:51:03,333 --> 00:51:04,880
They're all dead.

387
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:07,672
But I'm here.

388
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:15,382
You're not Natascha anymore.
We need a new name for you.

389
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,093
An entirely new name.

390
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:25,840
Look. Maria maybe.

391
00:51:27,917 --> 00:51:29,715
That's my grandmother's name?

392
00:51:31,625 --> 00:51:34,595
Yes, sure.
It's my middle name...

393
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:37,192
Well that won't work then, because we
need an entirely new name for you,

394
00:51:37,217 --> 00:51:38,813
let's find something else.

395
00:51:40,208 --> 00:51:41,755
Look, Christa?

396
00:51:42,958 --> 00:51:44,505
Viviana?

397
00:51:46,167 --> 00:51:47,714
Viviana?

398
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:50,503
Well all right. Viviana, that's it.

399
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:54,754
So, hold it...

400
00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:58,422
So as of today...

401
00:52:00,375 --> 00:52:02,594
As of today your name is...

402
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:09,380
Viviana.
Let's say Vivi, that's better.

403
00:52:10,917 --> 00:52:12,919
As of today your name is...

404
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,879
My name is Viviana.
No, your name is Vivi.

405
00:52:18,625 --> 00:52:20,172
My name is Vivi.

406
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,173
And you can call me Wolfgang.

407
00:52:28,875 --> 00:52:31,094
Well you could thank me.

408
00:52:33,042 --> 00:52:34,965
Thank you, Wolfgang...

409
00:52:37,875 --> 00:52:39,468
Don't look at me.

410
00:52:46,042 --> 00:52:49,251
Look, what I knitted for her.

411
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:56,292
You will need something warm
when she comes back.

412
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:00,922
It should fit her.

413
00:53:04,833 --> 00:53:07,177
Do you think she still likes pink?

414
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:15,174
I always took her to school...

415
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,547
in the car...

416
00:53:18,708 --> 00:53:20,255
every day.

417
00:53:22,917 --> 00:53:24,464
But that morning...

418
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,547
she just...

419
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,128
Why did it have to be her?

420
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:15,965
Take off your vest.

421
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:22,836
No need to wear it indoors.

422
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:33,006
What do you need all this space for?

423
00:54:39,958 --> 00:54:41,960
Is your girlfriend moving in?

424
00:54:58,208 --> 00:54:59,926
Can I have a shower?

425
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,594
You can sleep upstairs tonight.

426
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:20,505
With me.

427
00:55:48,917 --> 00:55:50,464
No.

428
00:57:22,792 --> 00:57:25,966
You got my sunscreen and lip balm?

429
00:57:26,292 --> 00:57:29,341
<i>- The energy bars are also there too.
- Good.</i>

430
00:57:31,958 --> 00:57:34,052
<i>- Do you have your gloves?
- Yes.</i>

431
00:57:42,833 --> 00:57:45,757
A propos...
Will you take me with you sometime?

432
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:52,261
If you behave yourself, maybe.

433
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:55,380
I do behave myself.

434
00:57:55,958 --> 00:57:57,505
Good.

435
00:58:06,708 --> 00:58:11,384
If you're good, we'd be out having a
great time, Just the two of us, yeah?

436
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:17,255
So a propos...
Have you heard the one about the skier?

437
00:58:17,792 --> 00:58:21,968
Just before the ski race begins,

438
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:27,338
an avalanche comes crashing down
and all the skiers have been killed.

439
00:58:27,958 --> 00:58:29,505
So...

440
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:31,630
Go on.

441
00:58:33,458 --> 00:58:36,091
So, the next morning...

442
00:58:36,558 --> 00:58:40,091
one of the widows,
comes to identify her dead husband.

443
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:44,133
They open the first coffin,
and she shakes her head.

444
00:58:44,292 --> 00:58:47,842
Then they open the second coffin,
she shakes her head again.

445
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,836
Then they open the third coffin,
and she nods: That's him.

446
00:58:53,292 --> 00:58:56,671
Thank God, at least he came in third!

447
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:50,677
No. The other one.

448
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,756
I want to go out in the garden.

449
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,047
You want a what?

450
01:03:25,167 --> 01:03:27,261
I'd like to go out in the garden, please.

451
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,459
You are just as tied to me as I am to you.

452
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:06,172
Day 2029.

453
01:06:08,625 --> 01:06:10,172
Not so much!

454
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:20,419
Put the plate mats down first,
How many times do I have to tell you?

455
01:06:24,625 --> 01:06:26,172
You don't need one.

456
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:34,007
Why do you have to do everything twice?

457
01:06:34,167 --> 01:06:37,142
I mean you have seven years walking back
and forth all the time?

458
01:06:37,167 --> 01:06:40,128
Hello, I 'em talking to you!

459
01:06:41,167 --> 01:06:42,714
And I'm listening.

460
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,130
Go on!

461
01:06:47,792 --> 01:06:49,465
And the oil is getting too hot.

462
01:06:51,542 --> 01:06:53,089
Fish.

463
01:06:56,708 --> 01:07:01,885
Come on. Even my mother
does it ten times faster.

464
01:07:05,833 --> 01:07:08,256
What about something to drink?

465
01:07:08,583 --> 01:07:10,130
Yeah.

466
01:07:15,125 --> 01:07:17,674
Since when do you need panties?

467
01:07:18,917 --> 01:07:20,464
Yes?

468
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:33,712
What are you brainless?
Put something down there!

469
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:35,801
Put something down there!

470
01:07:37,542 --> 01:07:39,215
Get those coasters.

471
01:07:41,042 --> 01:07:43,340
You're worst than a dog!

472
01:07:43,875 --> 01:07:46,628
A dog you can teach!

473
01:07:52,042 --> 01:07:53,589
Go sit.

474
01:08:25,792 --> 01:08:29,171
And don't think for a minute
you're gonna have any of this.

475
01:10:10,167 --> 01:10:12,716
We need to change the filter.

476
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:15,636
Go on.
You can get through there.

477
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:21,417
<i>- I can't.
- Yes you can. Go on.</i>

478
01:10:21,625 --> 01:10:25,209
<i>- You need a plumber.
- No! I don't, and you know why?</i>

479
01:10:25,417 --> 01:10:27,032
Because of you I can't
let one into the house!

480
01:10:27,057 --> 01:10:30,344
Go on, or there won't be any more water!

481
01:10:35,292 --> 01:10:36,839
Keep moving.

482
01:10:38,875 --> 01:10:40,969
That's it.

483
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:44,673
That's it. Go on!

484
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:50,255
That's it.

485
01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:58,878
Vivi?

486
01:11:08,667 --> 01:11:11,921
Come on. Can't you take a joke?

487
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:36,922
No.

488
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,254
I went to three shops to find them.

489
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:00,544
Don't even think about it.

490
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:06,050
I've got my gun and I'll kill anyone.

491
01:13:07,542 --> 01:13:09,089
Including you.

492
01:13:13,683 --> 01:13:15,630
Are we clear?

493
01:14:07,083 --> 01:14:08,630
I think my car is over there.

494
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:25,510
Lilac.

495
01:14:27,292 --> 01:14:29,386
For the bedroom maybe.

496
01:14:30,417 --> 01:14:31,964
8721

497
01:14:33,375 --> 01:14:34,922
Take one.

498
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:40,132
It will be enough for your room too.

499
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:57,998
<i>- I couldn't find it.
- I'll show you. Come with me.</i>

500
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:09,377
“Obey me, obey me.”

501
01:15:14,542 --> 01:15:18,297
Employees in the electrical please.

502
01:15:22,583 --> 01:15:27,510
It's extravagant for the bathroom,
I suppose, I like it though.

503
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:07,672
Vivi.

504
01:16:08,875 --> 01:16:10,422
Go on. Go on.

505
01:16:13,667 --> 01:16:15,214
Vivi.

506
01:16:16,875 --> 01:16:19,058
Day 2175.

507
01:16:19,083 --> 01:16:20,630
Come here, Vivi.

508
01:16:23,875 --> 01:16:25,877
Come here.
Come here.

509
01:16:29,458 --> 01:16:31,005
Yeah...

510
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:36,880
Yeah.

511
01:16:39,833 --> 01:16:41,380
Yes, it's very good.

512
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:57,922
Surprise!

513
01:16:58,625 --> 01:17:00,252
Wow, lilac!

514
01:17:03,042 --> 01:17:06,421
<i>- Look. Hmm?
- Yeah, it's nice.</i>

515
01:17:07,542 --> 01:17:10,011
And see. All gold.

516
01:17:11,958 --> 01:17:14,882
I know, I put the tiles in myself.

517
01:17:23,792 --> 01:17:27,877
The Aphrodite bedroom.
Or do you like The Passion better?

518
01:17:28,917 --> 01:17:30,464
Well, take a pick.

519
01:17:31,833 --> 01:17:36,964
<i>- I'd like to grow my hair back.
- So we go for Aphrodite.</i>

520
01:17:38,042 --> 01:17:40,215
Yes.

521
01:17:41,917 --> 01:17:43,590
Oh, it's so nice.

522
01:17:45,042 --> 01:17:47,465
And the carpet, so pretty.

523
01:17:49,792 --> 01:17:51,339
The color...

524
01:17:52,583 --> 01:17:54,677
You have good taste.

525
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:59,004
Well.
Plenty of room now for two...

526
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:02,753
Come on.
I've got a surprise.

527
01:18:04,208 --> 01:18:05,755
<i>- Now?
- Now!</i>

528
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:14,255
I suppose everybody needs
somebody sometime, Am I right?

529
01:18:14,417 --> 01:18:15,964
You are.

530
01:18:16,333 --> 01:18:18,051
Now try it.

531
01:18:18,208 --> 01:18:21,337
<i>- That's very strong.
- Oh, don't be silly.</i>

532
01:18:27,917 --> 01:18:32,172
It's delicious.
I'm sure it will make me drunk.

533
01:18:40,458 --> 01:18:42,005
You are so funny.

534
01:18:42,208 --> 01:18:44,825
On a battling case in
Austria, it's been 6

535
01:18:44,838 --> 01:18:47,465
years since Natascha
Kampusch was kidnapped.

536
01:18:47,583 --> 01:18:52,043
On her way to school, there had
never been any real leads on the case.

537
01:18:52,167 --> 01:18:53,760
I 'em here.

538
01:18:53,958 --> 01:18:58,213
Many listeners will still recall
holding photos of the missing girl

539
01:18:58,375 --> 01:19:02,505
splashed across the bridge and grass
during the first months of…

540
01:19:02,667 --> 01:19:04,385
But I'm still alive...

541
01:19:04,542 --> 01:19:07,073
As an ever riding theme for this book,
It's terrifying.

542
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:10,573
So many people disappear without a trace.

543
01:19:35,958 --> 01:19:40,043
Why are you lying in bed in
the middle of the day?

544
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:43,880
Get up!

545
01:19:44,917 --> 01:19:46,464
Aphrodite is here.

546
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:50,344
<i>- Who?
- Aphrodite.</i>

547
01:19:51,667 --> 01:19:53,214
The bedroom suite.

548
01:20:01,708 --> 01:20:03,255
Our wedding night.

549
01:20:22,958 --> 01:20:24,505
This is very nice.

550
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:32,880
What?

551
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:36,011
<i>- You do want to.
- No...</i>

552
01:20:37,417 --> 01:20:41,422
You belong to me, and I do
whatever I want with you.

553
01:20:46,958 --> 01:20:49,052
Why did you pick me?

554
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:56,502
I saw your smile...

555
01:21:00,083 --> 01:21:01,960
I saw your smile.

556
01:21:05,292 --> 01:21:09,297
<i>- Hello, sweetheart, are you all right?
- Natascha, no more biscuits.</i>

557
01:21:23,083 --> 01:21:26,007
How long did it take you to finish this?

558
01:21:28,542 --> 01:21:30,670
From June to the following March.

559
01:21:33,042 --> 01:21:35,340
The pipes and cables.

560
01:21:38,083 --> 01:21:39,630
The plastering.

561
01:21:41,458 --> 01:21:44,792
Always going to different
hardware stores to get things.

562
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:48,756
Getting rid of the earth
in different places.

563
01:21:51,550 --> 01:21:53,558
Installing in the doors.

564
01:21:53,583 --> 01:21:55,460
Ventilation.

565
01:21:57,208 --> 01:21:58,755
All for you.

566
01:23:30,083 --> 01:23:31,676
Don't look at me that way.

567
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:34,843
Stop looking at me!

568
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:47,297
What's that smell?

569
01:26:52,417 --> 01:26:53,964
What are you up to?

570
01:26:54,583 --> 01:26:56,130
Nothing.

571
01:26:57,417 --> 01:27:00,796
You're not killing yourself,
you understand?

572
01:27:01,042 --> 01:27:04,842
You will not kill yourself, you understand?

573
01:27:05,833 --> 01:27:07,380
Look at me!

574
01:27:14,792 --> 01:27:16,339
Ah!
You...

575
01:27:16,708 --> 01:27:18,426
Will... not...

576
01:27:19,458 --> 01:27:21,005
kill...

577
01:27:22,958 --> 01:27:26,007
yourself!
Do you understand?

578
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:53,052
Why do you have to ruin everything?

579
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,173
It could be so nice.

580
01:27:58,667 --> 01:28:00,590
But you ruin it.

581
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:12,047
Let me go...

582
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,047
Never.

583
01:28:21,083 --> 01:28:23,302
Then one of us has to die.

584
01:28:52,958 --> 01:28:57,008
18 blows to the head.

585
01:29:06,208 --> 01:29:09,462
6 punches in the stomach

586
01:29:15,167 --> 01:29:17,886
12 strokes in the ear.

587
01:29:22,042 --> 01:29:25,467
4 kicks to the legs.

588
01:30:31,792 --> 01:30:33,385
Go on. Go on!

589
01:30:42,833 --> 01:30:45,803
Get up.
Don't act so helpless.

590
01:30:46,708 --> 01:30:48,802
I can't...
Come on!

591
01:30:52,917 --> 01:30:54,464
Go!

592
01:30:54,958 --> 01:30:56,505
Go!

593
01:30:59,333 --> 01:31:00,880
Oh, God!

594
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:06,961
My knees are so shaky.
You're going to ski!

595
01:31:07,125 --> 01:31:08,553
<i>How much do you think
all this stuff costs?</i>

596
01:31:08,566 --> 01:31:10,004
<i>53 Euros.</i>

597
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:12,210
<i>- What?
- € 53!</i>

598
01:31:12,375 --> 01:31:13,922
Then go.

599
01:31:30,792 --> 01:31:32,339
I'm gonna go.

600
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:35,047
All right.

601
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:43,298
Put on your sunglasses.

602
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:54,797
Hello?

603
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:40,054
Please, can you help me!
I've been kidnapped.

604
01:32:40,067 --> 01:32:42,631
My name is Natascha Kampusch.

605
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:21,754
What happened in that toilet?
Nothing...

606
01:33:24,083 --> 01:33:25,881
Don't lie to me.

607
01:35:04,750 --> 01:35:06,297
An 18...

608
01:35:07,667 --> 01:35:09,385
You want me to cut it?

609
01:35:21,625 --> 01:35:25,380
What, aren't you hungry? Hmm?
Take a much bigger.

610
01:35:27,708 --> 01:35:29,255
All right.

611
01:35:34,792 --> 01:35:36,715
All right.

612
01:35:41,458 --> 01:35:43,005
All right.

613
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,593
Happy Birthday.

614
01:35:47,875 --> 01:35:49,422
Thank you.

615
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:55,718
A dress!
Put it on.

616
01:36:18,167 --> 01:36:19,714
Here...

617
01:36:30,917 --> 01:36:32,464
You want to dance?

618
01:36:33,583 --> 01:36:35,130
Yes?

619
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:39,093
I am a good dancer.

620
01:36:53,417 --> 01:36:56,546
God... you can't even dance.
Come here.

621
01:36:56,917 --> 01:37:03,380
Slow, slow, wait, wait.
Slow, slow, wait, wait.

622
01:37:03,750 --> 01:37:06,959
Slow, slow, wait, wait.

623
01:37:40,625 --> 01:37:42,172
Hello!

624
01:37:44,417 --> 01:37:45,964
Hello.

625
01:37:56,792 --> 01:37:58,669
You're dumber than a dog!

626
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:51,676
I'm selling the van.
To have a bit of money.

627
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:59,003
Got to get it nice clean.

628
01:39:04,667 --> 01:39:06,385
All right, vacuum it inside.

629
01:39:09,125 --> 01:39:13,130
I want it completely clean.
The seats as well as the floor.

630
01:39:13,542 --> 01:39:18,127
I'll do the windows. You won't,
'cause I just told you to vacuum.

631
01:39:19,667 --> 01:39:21,214
The mags!

632
01:40:14,583 --> 01:40:16,130
Oh...

633
01:40:21,167 --> 01:40:22,714
Hello?

634
01:40:23,792 --> 01:40:26,671
Yes.
It's about the Van.

635
01:40:27,167 --> 01:40:30,296
Say. Hold a moment.
One second...

636
01:40:33,292 --> 01:40:36,011
Right. Sorry...
Just a second.

637
01:40:37,292 --> 01:40:42,093
No, not yet.
It is still for sale.

638
01:40:43,708 --> 01:40:46,632
Uh, I think It had two previous owners.

639
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:11,469
Come tomorrow at two...

640
01:41:58,083 --> 01:42:02,384
Hello? Hello, can you help me?
Please call the police!

641
01:42:02,583 --> 01:42:05,074
<i>What are you doing
in my garden?</i>

642
01:42:05,087 --> 01:42:07,589
<i>Natascha Kampusch!
It's about a kidnapping!</i>

643
01:42:08,083 --> 01:42:10,584
Day 3096.

644
01:42:19,542 --> 01:42:24,469
Right, stay where you are, please!
Is this the girl you phone me about?

645
01:42:24,625 --> 01:42:27,469
<i>- Yes.
- Do you have any form of identification?</i>

646
01:42:29,833 --> 01:42:34,669
<i>- Do you have any form of identification?
- My name is Natascha Kampusch.</i>

647
01:42:35,375 --> 01:42:37,924
I was kidnapped eight years ago.

648
01:42:47,583 --> 01:42:49,130
Hello?

649
01:42:49,875 --> 01:42:51,422
Speaking...

650
01:43:13,292 --> 01:43:14,839
Any news of him?

651
01:44:11,875 --> 01:44:13,422
Mom...

652
01:44:53,292 --> 01:44:55,169

1
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,418
<i>Everyone's heard of the city
that never sleeps.</i>

2
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,105
<i>What about the mothers who never sleep</i>

3
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:50,175
<i>because their boys move to the city
and never call?</i>

4
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:55,096
<i>This is a story about three such mothers
and their three sons.</i>

5
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,474
Oh! Stop the cab! Stop the cab!

6
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,476
Look where we are.

7
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,436
You guys are such profound assholes.

8
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,564
- It's time, Daniel.
- I know. I'm still deciding.

9
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,983
- You decided. You got a ring.
- Yes.

10
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,568
- You're getting engaged!
- Yes.

11
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,153
Right now? Isn't that fantastic?

12
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,989
I'm not asking Erin to marry me
tonight, drunk with girls in the car.

13
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,407
- No offense.
- Come on! Go!

14
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,891
- We're going to Matt's.
- D, I love you, but get out.

15
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,080
- Come on. Come on.
- Bye.

16
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:21,955
Look...

17
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,125
you are happy with Erin.

18
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,253
Like, happier than I've seen you since...

19
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,005
sixth grade.

20
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,774
Dude! Remember when you said
you'd have your first novel finished

21
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,927
by the end of the year,
three ends-of-the-years ago?

22
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,929
- Horrible pep talk.
- These are the facts.

23
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,698
She's hot.
I'm gonna do it if you don't.

24
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,450
- That's actually a better pep talk.
- Erin!

25
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,701
All right.

26
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,393
Baby! Erin!

27
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:46,564
- This is why we don't hang out anymore.
- Listen to me, okay?

28
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,608
This would be romantic.

29
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:51,653
This is the story
that she's gonna tell your kids.

30
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:55,573
She's gonna say, "That's the night
that he stormed up the stairs

31
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,450
and got down on one knee..."

32
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,662
And you asked if she would marry you.

33
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,166
- That is novel material.
- Novel material.

34
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:10,213
- It would be a pretty great story.
- Ahhh!

35
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,009
<i>We were there
for every big life event</i>

36
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:18,304
<i>and now we're lucky
if we hear about anything at all.</i>

37
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,274
Erin?

38
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,403
Daniel?

39
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,197
What the fuck?

40
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,202
<i>There's a lot you don't know as mothers.</i>

41
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,329
<i>In fact, that's what bonded us</i>

42
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,999
<i>when the boys' friendship
launched our friendship</i>

43
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,210
<i>on a playground in Poughkeepsie.</i>

44
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,214
<i>♪ Sometimes in our lives ♪</i>

45
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,842
<i>♪ We all have pain ♪</i>

46
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:00,430
<i>♪ We all have sorrow ♪</i>

47
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,723
<i>♪ But... ♪</i>

48
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,350
<i>We've been through
so much together.</i>

49
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,978
<i>Graduations, proms, skinned knees,</i>

50
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:12,400
<i>emergency room visits, family vacations,
bad days, bad jobs.</i>

51
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:15,695
<i>And at every scary and unfamiliar stage,</i>

52
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,782
<i>the answer was always "friends."</i>

53
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:27,290
<i>That's Gillian.
She still has kids in the house,</i>

54
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,833
<i>they're just not hers.</i>

55
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,835
Why are you teaching today?

56
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:35,882
It's just one lesson. He wants to play
this later for his mother.

57
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,968
- He still likes her.
- Daniel texted you already.

58
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,764
Nothing says "I don't wanna talk to you"
like a text.

59
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,308
- He said he misses us.
- That's nice.

60
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,268
Hmm. It's a lie.

61
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,230
But it's a nice lie.

62
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,277
<i>And that's Helen.</i>

63
00:03:56,361 --> 00:04:00,198
<i>She never ages.
At least, not publicly.</i>

64
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,578
Frank, I have to run
a few errands before I go to Carol's.

65
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,914
Would you tell her that I could sell
her house tomorrow

66
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,332
if she just gave me the listing?

67
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,126
Are you spray-painting
the top of your head again?

68
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,212
I'm tall enough, so no one even sees it.

69
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,214
Unless you're sitting.

70
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,633
Carol talks a good game, Frank,

71
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,969
but she will never sell that house.

72
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,054
You'd have to sell it with her in it.

73
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,725
<i>The three of us don't see
each other as often as we used to.</i>

74
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,394
<i>The boys are gone.</i>

75
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,479
<i>Husbands have come and gone.</i>

76
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,732
<i>But one tradition remains.</i>

77
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,404
- I'm so glad we're still doing this!
- Happy Mother's Day!

78
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,407
Without husbands and kids,
it might actually be fun.

79
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,243
- I brought donuts.
- Oh!

80
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,869
I brought bourbon.

81
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,747
Like, I'm really going to drink a mimosa?
It's Mother's Day.

82
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,207
I knew I should have Ubered.

83
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,503
Guys, I think the guy
at the liquor store was flirting with me.

84
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,756
Oh, I can't remember the last time
someone flirted with me.

85
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,277
I bet it happens all the time.
You're just not flirting back.

86
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,511
Why do you flirt back? You're married.

87
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,656
Well, my marriage
isn't as perfect as yours, Gillian.

88
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,015
Besides, flirting isn't cheating,

89
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,891
it's just a little pick-me-up
for your ego.

90
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,619
It keeps your in shape, sexually speaking.

91
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,478
Ah, so it's sexercise.

92
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,314
Yes, women should sexercise daily.

93
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,400
Ooh! Terrific,
another thing that I'm not doing.

94
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,985
Come on!

95
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:22,613
There's nothing you're not doing.
Look at this spread.

96
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,782
And you're always volunteering...

97
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:28,661
Oh, please. I teach art
in a retirement home two days a week.

98
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,121
I'm hardly Mother Teresa.

99
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,206
And look at your house,
it's spotless.

100
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,585
The key to a clean house?
Dead husband.

101
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,672
Oh, God. That came out
much darker than I intended.

102
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,759
No, that's a great household tip.

103
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,512
What is with these flowers?

104
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,474
Come on, they get bigger every year.
Did Matt send these?

105
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,684
Yes. Delivered this morning.

106
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,520
Matty is the perfect son.
He never forgets.

107
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,315
- Is he dating anyone?
- He doesn't have time.

108
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:00,318
And he's helping to launch
some new sports magazine.

109
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,363
So, he just works, works out and sleeps,
so he says.

110
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,074
No, Paul is the same way,
he never mentions dating anyone.

111
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,410
God, I wish Daniel would date
someone other than that Erin.

112
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,084
She's not good enough for him.
I told him that.

113
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,207
Oh! And how did that go?

114
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:19,253
- He unfriended me.
- See? Now, that's why I'm not on Facebook.

115
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,630
- Aww.
- Oh!

116
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,716
- Remember how cute they were?
- Remember how cute we were?

117
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,343
When did I turn 50?

118
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:29,305
Oh, several years after I did,
so shut up and enjoy your youth.

119
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,682
I love that with us,
we don't have to lie about our age.

120
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,435
I love with us, we don't have to lie
about anything.

121
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,353
Hmm.

122
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,356
Look, I've just polished off
a whole donut in front of you two.

123
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:42,443
I didn't even pretend to only want half.
Come on, that's friendship.

124
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,487
Aww, you are so right.

125
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,910
I sent myself the flowers.

126
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,626
I've been doing it for a while now.

127
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,004
And each year
it gets more and more depressing

128
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,888
so I get bigger and bigger flowers.

129
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:06,883
Well...

130
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,720
but you don't include a note, do you?

131
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:13,266
No!
I would not write my own...

132
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,309
Yes.

133
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,354
What did the note say this year?

134
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,483
- You are the best mother ever.
- Yes.

135
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,736
- Well, you are.
- What son forgets Mother's Day?

136
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,448
What kind of son sends
a Mother's Day text?

137
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,907
Pass the bourbon.

138
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,617
Come on, lazy!

139
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,619
Buy me some bath salts.
Is that so difficult?

140
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,205
Hmm. A candle. A frame, something.

141
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,374
I should have sent myself flowers.
It's brilliant.

142
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,585
Daniel can't call me
from Long Island City?

143
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,879
God, I have a girl for him to meet.

144
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,173
The little jerk won't even call me back.

145
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,341
Paul stopped caring about me
when I married Frank.

146
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,886
Matt hasn't been home
since Finn's funeral.

147
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:54,015
And he barely came home for that,
stayed 16 hours, and he wore sneakers.

148
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,184
They were nice ones. They were Gucci.

149
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,520
What did we do wrong?

150
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,773
We did everything right.
That's what we did wrong.

151
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:07,028
And we raised our children to be
free-thinking, independent beings

152
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,447
and now, they just don't need us anymore.

153
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,074
Well, they're gonna need us again
when they have kids.

154
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,878
- When we're grandmothers.
- I don't want to be a grandmother, but...

155
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,455
I would like one Mother's Day card.

156
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,332
Motherhood.

157
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,337
That sinking feeling that
as your child's growing up

158
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,257
that you're being broken up with,
on a gradual but daily basis.

159
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,093
It's inhumane emotional waterboarding.

160
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,348
That is the best description
of motherhood I've ever heard.

161
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,474
Mm-hmm.

162
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:40,269
Well, at this stage, it doesn't feel like
motherhood. It feels like "otherhood."

163
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,480
Oh, my God, you're so right.

164
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,315
I don't want to be an other.

165
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,817
Me neither.
But what are we going to do?

166
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,654
Drive to Manhattan,
storm their apartments?

167
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,073
No, we've got to respect their space,

168
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:56,577
let them individuate, blah, blah, blah.

169
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,662
Except...

170
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,207
it's fucking Mother's Day.

171
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,301
Come on, Carol!
We're doing this!

172
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,223
I'm so excited!

173
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,766
Okay. All set.

174
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,810
Oh, my God. See ya!

175
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,730
- I need some grown-up luggage.
- This is my good-luck bag from Guatemala.

176
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,941
Here we go! Yay!

177
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,949

192
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,797
I think the bourbon just wore off.
Have we really thought this through?

193
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,633
What if the boys don't want to see us?

194
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:38,220
Mother isn't just a noun,
it's a verb. It requires action.

195
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,097
I read that some place.

196
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,475
- Well, I teach on Tuesdays.
- Just call in sick.

197
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,186
That's what I did for the first time
in... ever.

198
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,146
I brought five clean pairs of underwear.

199
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,649
Hey, I might be sick all week.

200
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:53,110
All week?
Well, how long are we staying?

201
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,779
Until we feel like mothers again.

202
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,490
Why can't we feel like mothers
from a hotel room?

203
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,283
Now, that is a valid question.

204
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,620
Because we're not on vacation,
we are on a mission.

205
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,183
And they can deal with having us
in their homes for a few days.

206
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,708
- They were in ours for 18 years.
- Hmm.

207
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,214
You got this, champ!
Go in and call us when you're in!

208
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,858
Gillian, I can't do this!

209
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,093
Oh, you can!
You're gonna do really great.

210
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,456
No, no. Let's stop this.

211
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,221
Yeah, you are!

212
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,890
Don't take no
for an answer. Make him love you!

213
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,810
Helen, Gillian! Wait!

214
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,031
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Hi, I just happen to be in the neighbor...

215
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,492
I'm downstairs, it's your mo...

216
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,261
Mom?

217
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,141
- Uh, what are you...
- I was just missing you today.

218
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,811
- Shit, it's Mother's Day.
- Is it?

219
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,272
- I was gonna call.
- Can I come in?

220
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,774
Yeah. Of course. Please.

221
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:17,111
Please. Um...

222
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,697
I sent the elevator.

223
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,741
Oh, It's just five floors.

224
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,369
Well, can I get you something?

225
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,621
Well, you didn't even hug me.

226
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,291
I...

227
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,877
You caught me off guard.

228
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,715
Happy Mother's Day, Mom.

229
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,177
- Ah, let's just sit.
- Yeah.

230
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,262
Uh, let's just put this away.

231
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,391
That's gone. And stack that up.

232
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,607
That's not even...

233
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:10,039
I've been thinking about
our relationship and, um, I...

234
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,002
I don't think we have one.

235
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,921
What? Mom.

236
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,758
Mom, you are my mom.
How could we not have one?

237
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,092
What's my favorite flower?

238
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,764
- We have a relationship.
- Then tell me something about me.

239
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,558
Okay, there are a thousand things
that I know about you.

240
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,352
Irises.

241
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:33,854
I... I knew that.

242
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,943
Um, I want to stay for a few days.

243
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,487
What? No. Mom. I mean, why?

244
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,573
Because you still live
like a 15-year old, sweetheart,

245
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,741
I mean, look!

246
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,451
Look at this mess.

247
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:52,081
I'll clean while you think of ten things
that you honestly know about me.

248
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,332
Okay, Mom. Ten?

249
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,248
- It's going to take me days to clean...
- Mom! Mom!

250
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,295
I have a woman for that.

251
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,340
Well, how often does she come?
Biannually?

252
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,589
Mm-mmm.

253
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,767
<i>Hey, it's Daniel Lieberman.
I'm guessing you know what to do.</i>

254
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,572
Oh, God.

255
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,491
Did you get in?

256
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,660
Yeah. I got in.

257
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,494
Tell me something.

258
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,414
Does Paul have drapes?

259
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,958
Matt has 75 pairs of

260
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,127
<i>brand new sneakers,
but no drapes.</i>

261
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,755
Yes, Paul has drapes.

262
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,505
Listen...

263
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,093
would you mind
if I called you back tomorrow?

264
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,762
Oh, yeah, sure, sorry.

265
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,221
Enjoy!

266
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,599
Okay. Yeah, I will. Goodnight, honey.

267
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:42,899
Just stop.

268
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,448
I'm a coward, okay? Hey.

269
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,408
Hey. Thank you.

270
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,202
How's it going with Paul?

271
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:57,581
<i>Good. Paul has been very gracious.</i>

272
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,792
He just poured me a drink.

273
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,086
<i>How's it going with Daniel?</i>

274
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,714
I'm going to go by in the morning.
Daniel's not answering the phone.

275
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,758
I think he's got that caller ID thing.

276
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,052
<i>But I'll tell you this, Long Island City</i>

277
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,346
<i>is the place to go
if you want to be stabbed.</i>

278
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,683
<i>'Cause I was terrified
to get out of my car.</i>

279
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:20,020
Hey, have you heard of this place,
the Hudson Hotel?

280
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,897
<i>It's where Joel got the best rate.</i>

281
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,816
Oh, yeah. It's supposed to be cool.

282
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:27,820
<i>It's really cool. I mean,
it's more like a club than a hotel.</i>

283
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,491
And the bellboys are gorgeous.

284
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,077
<i>Gillian, you scamp.</i>

285
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,746
Uh, I'm gonna ambush

286
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,415
<i>Daniel when it's light.</i>

287
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,958
Oh, listen.

288
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,003
It is okay that you decided to wait.

289
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,505
It's a difficult thing to do.

290
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,757
I don't blame you.

291
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,803
Actually... I've...

292
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,472
<i>I've...</i>

293
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,808
<i>Oh, hey,
can you tell Paul that I said hi?</i>

294
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,018
Hmm.

295
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,562
Gillian says hello.

296
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,023
Paul says hello back.

297
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,275
- <i>All right, sweet dreams.</i>
- Okay.

298
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,527
- <i>Night, hun.</i>
- Good night.

299
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,641
I found some sausages
in your freezer.

300
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,187
Took the skillet I gave you for college
graduation out of the box.

301
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,023
Well, I don't eat breakfast.

302
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,110
You used to eat breakfast.
"Most important meal of the day."

303
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:54,198
Yeah, according to Dad,
and whoever said it originally.

304
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,533
Probably someone involved
in the cereal business.

305
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,873
I need to get dressed and get to work.

306
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,374
Oh, well, don't let me stop you.

307
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,462
- Are those banana pancakes?
- Mmm.

308
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,342
Well, I guess one...

309
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:14,927
wouldn't kill me.

310
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,415
- It's after 8:00, you're late.
- Hi. I...

311
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,983
And if you touch anything on my desk,
you're fired. Understand?

312
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,903
- I'm here to see Paul.
- He'll pay you. Andre!

313
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,363
- Don't mess up.
- Okay.

314
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,204
Oh!

315
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,624
- Hi.
- Hi.

316
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,918
You're the new housekeeper.

317
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,504
I'm Paul's mother.

318
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:54,924
I'm Helen.

319
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,344
- Right, yes, sorry. Hi, I'm Andre.
- Hi.

320
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,346
- Nice to meet you.
- Are you...

321
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,306
are you Paul's boyfriend?

322
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,768
I'll see if he's dressed.

323
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,146
Um... I just made some coffee.

324
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,356
- I'd love some coffee.
- Please, join me.

325
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,609
Uh...

326
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,239
Paul never officially came out to me,
you know.

327
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,616
- So...
- Did you ever ask?

328
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,495
It wasn't my place to ask.
It was his place to tell.

329
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:27,457
I'm sure at some point he knew I knew,
but we never, you know...

330
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,792
talked about it.

331
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,545
Ah, well, my parents are visually deaf,
I mean...

332
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,547
Hello?

333
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,799
What do you do, Andre?

334
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,218
Uh, as little as I can get away with.

335
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,719
Oh!

336
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,597
He never alters his pattern.

337
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,492
I can tell by the creaks in the floor
when he's about to come downstairs.

338
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,350
Oh!

339
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,645
Oh, my God. I owe you a blow job.

340
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,189
- Your mother.
<i>- Your</i> mother.

341
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,024
Surprise!

342
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,610
Hey, Mom!

343
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,029
Boo!

344
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:00,490
I know it doesn't make any sense
for me to try to maintain that house.

345
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,451
It's in constant need of repairs.

346
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,287
And no one's even been in the pool
since your father died.

347
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,123
- So, just sell it.
- But we've been there for 20 years.

348
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,893
- I haven't.
- He didn't want me to be alone,

349
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,251
and I don't want to be, but...

350
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,045
the mattress...

351
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,465
it sags where your father slept.

352
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,260
And I keep thinking,
"Maybe I should just buy a new one."

353
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,887
But if I did that, then...

354
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,933
the mattress wouldn't sag
where your father slept.

355
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,780
Well, that's a nice greeting
for your mother.

356
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,116
What's a nice greeting?
I didn't say anything.

357
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,580
That's what I'm talking about.

358
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,247
Are you and Dad fighting or something?

359
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,998
I came to see if you were okay.

360
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,084
I'm fantastic.

361
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,544
You... want a screwdriver or something?

362
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,171
Are you trying to make me cry?

363
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,258
Can you not threaten me with feelings, Ma?
Just don't worry about me.

364
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,969
Your life is your life. Mine is mine.

365
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,763
Oh, that's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

366
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,599
If everyone was just here for themselves,
life would be pointless.

367
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,184
Life <i>is</i> pointless.

368
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,436
Children give your life meaning.

369
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,814
You are the point of my life, Daniel.

370
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,066
Please, don't make me question
my existence.

371
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,694
- Oh, my God, Ma. What are you doing here?
- Really?

372
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:22,823
That's where we are? I drive for hours
and hours and the first thing

373
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:25,906
- you say is, "What are you doing here?"
- It wasn't the first thing I said,

374
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,791
- it was the last thing I said.
- Okay.

375
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,391
I'll go. If you don't want me, I'll go.
I'll just get my bag...

376
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,916
Ma, I'm not saying I don't want you.

377
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,603
I'm just wondering why you didn't call me
first to tell me you were coming.

378
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,504
You didn't call me on Mother's Day.

379
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,715
I'm not holding that against you.

380
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,924
I texted you.

381
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,175
I birthed you.

382
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,594
Anyway, that's not why I'm here.

383
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,972
I found you a nice Jewish girl.

384
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,515
You weren't even Jewish.

385
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,475
I converted, for you.

386
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,019
Okay, you converted for Dad.

387
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,896
Yes, so we could raise our kids as Jews.

388
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,815
So, stop dating the shiksas.

389
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,943
Are you talking about Erin?

390
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,237
Erin. What kind of name is that?

391
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,281
It's like the leftovers
of a Scrabble hand.

392
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,783
Mm-hmm. That's a character flaw now?
Her name?

393
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,994
You met her once,
you barely even spoke to her.

394
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:12,039
- You never even gave her a chance.
- I saw her social media.

395
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,541
A lot of Margarita nights.
She's a drinker.

396
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,002
- I'm a drinker.
- You're a thinker.

397
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,046
You use alcohol as a coping mechanism.

398
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,673
That's the definition of alcoholism.

399
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,759
You're an intellectual,
she's a hairdresser.

400
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,719
Hairstylist. And so what?

401
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:29,181
So, let her style your hair,
but don't procreate with her.

402
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,767
That is so classist and offensive.

403
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,269
And it's over.
So, why don't you just move on, okay?

404
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,687
I have.

405
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,607
Remember the Brimers?

406
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,401
- Ivan and Joan.
- No.

407
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,863
On the corner, with that horrible shih tzu
that bit you when you were six.

408
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,198
Yeah, I remember the dog.

409
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:49,951
Well, Joan's sister has a nephew
by marriage in Yonkers,

410
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,580
and he gave me this number
of this brilliant woman from his temple.

411
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:58,085
She's just been through a painful divorce,
which apparently was not her fault at all.

412
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,419
Okay, good to know.

413
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:02,964
And she is a beautiful person.
She's friends with his wife.

414
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,550
Oh, my God. Ma, you've never
even met her, have you?

415
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,594
I saw her social media.

416
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,554
She is smart.

417
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,972
She did a beach clean-up.

418
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,558
Daniel, she's starting to think
about dating again.

419
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,560
We got to get in there fast.

420
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,925
When I reached out to her,
I told her that you were nearby

421
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,732
and in a similar boat. She said
she would love to hear from you.

422
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:21,858
Why have you done this?

423
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,111
Her name is Alison.

424
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,531
She graduated from Brown.
She has a political science degree.

425
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,074
She does something in television.

426
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,397
Okay, let me get this straight.

427
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,327
You want me to go on a date
with this woman

428
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:36,331
based on the fact that she attends temple
with some guy in Yonkers,

429
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,751
who's somehow related to the woman
whose dog bit me when I was a kid.

430
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,129
You can't hold that horrible dog
against her.

431
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,089
I'm not talking about the dog, Ma.

432
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,508
I'm talking about your insanity.

433
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,844
Ooh! Good shot.

434
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,263
Have you had a date
since you've lived here?

435
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,348
I don't think this apartment
is helping at all.

436
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,434
It's like you're living in Gollum's cave.

437
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:59,438
Okay, Ma, thanks for the dating advice.
Please, just leave it. Please.

438
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,190
I'm not leaving New York
until you call her.

439
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,360
You can't force me
to go on a date with someone.

440
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:08,113
I call it prodding,
a gentle little nudge.

441
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,866
Okay, I'll be back at supper time.

442
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,993
I need my Mace and my keys.

443
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,663
I'll be back. Alive.
Hopefully.

444
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,173
Hi, is this Alison?

445
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,801
It's... It's... Daniel Lieberman.

446
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,679
My mom said I should call you.

447
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:37,267
So, Paul lives with his... Andre?

448
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,768
Yes, and some other people.

449
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,146
It's kinda great.
It's sort of a group home for gays.

450
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,482
There's an older Wall Street guy
that owns the place

451
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:46,026
and a tiny man who is very abrupt.

452
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,862
And I told Andre I was gonna cook
for the whole gang tonight.

453
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:52,699
You? Cooking? That's more shocking
than your son coming out.

454
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,119
Well, apparently he's been completely out
to everybody but me.

455
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,997
- Honey, he just assumed you knew.
- I did know.

456
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,749
- Well, we all knew.
- No, I didn't

457
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,709
Why am I the last to get the memo?

458
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,461
You're not. Larry is.

459
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:07,104
He had one foot out the door
by the time Paul was in high school.

460
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,925
So, I thought, "I'm gonna let him
find out by himself."

461
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:14,387
You know, his only son, it's gonna drive
that closed-minded, lying dickhead crazy.

462
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,307
Oh, Larry!
Can we talk about something else?

463
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,935
Absolutely. How is Daniel?

464
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,144
Ugh.

465
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,939
It's worse than I imagined,
and that's never happened to me before.

466
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,607
- I under worry.
- Hmm!

467
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,735
Well, all the more reason
for you to leave your hotel

468
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:31,363
and move in like Helen and I did.

469
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,698
Yeah, I'm in a hotel, too.

470
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,990
What?

471
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:38,995
Yes, I know what I said.
But, you know, Paul's got his plate full

472
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,319
and he doesn't need a house guest
on top of it, you know?

473
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,875
So, he forgot Mother's Day. Big deal.

474
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:44,876
- Big deal?
- Yeah.

475
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,170
What? You got me drunk
and made me come here.

476
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,588
But, seriously?

477
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,508
How do you live in this town
and forget Mother's Day?

478
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,344
Look! Mother, mom, mama, <i>mütter,
madre, maman.</i>

479
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,222
This is Joseph.

480
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,724
Look at these cute bags. Let's go in.

481
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,936
No. Paul does Joseph.
He did these windows.

482
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:08,400
I am so moving in with that fucker.

483
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,158
Hi.
Are you the famous writer?

484
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,953
Either my mom exaggerated,
or you're meeting someone else.

485
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,121
I'm Alison.

486
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,415
- Daniel. Hi.
- Hello.

487
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:26,167
You write for <i>The New Yorker.</i>
That's, um, pretty famous.

488
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,711
I don't write for <i>The New Yorker.</i>

489
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,422
Oh, I thought your mom said
that you did write for <i>The New Yorker.</i>

490
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:33,466
<i>The New Yorker</i> published
one short story of mine four years ago...

491
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,550
- Yay!
- ...which...

492
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,221
resulted in a very small book deal,
but as of yet, no book.

493
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,348
- Oh.
- The rest of my work

494
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,785
if you can call it that is in literary
journals no one's ever heard of.

495
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,853
- No, I might have heard of them.
- No, you haven't.

496
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,062
Come on, tell me.

497
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,316
<i>- The Willacoochee River Journal.</i>
- No.

498
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,192
- It's funny, right?
- You're making that up.

499
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:54,821
I wish I could make that up.
Sadly, that is nonfiction.

500
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:55,946
That is my life.

501
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,907
My mom should talk less.

502
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,676
Yeah, but if your mom talked less,
we wouldn't be here right now.

503
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,622
So, you know, thank God
for your mother, right?

504
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,459
<i>Daniel!</i>

505
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:10,503
If you're there
and you're pretending you're not,

506
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,213
I'm never talking to you again.

507
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,132
Or maybe that's what you want.

508
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,675
Daniel!

509
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:18,886
What?

510
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:22,098
My God! This is totally unsafe.

511
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,811
Oh, come on. It's open?

512
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,989
Come on, old girl. You still got it.

513
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:39,866
Okay.

514
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,331
Ah! Mice!

515
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,192
So, you lived in New York?

516
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,420
Did I ever.
I worked in fashion at the time.

517
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,381
I met Paul's father at Studio 54.

518
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,839
- No.
- Yeah.

519
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,008
Fabulous.

520
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,718
Oh, yes, and ridiculous.

521
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,946
You're supposed to have sex
with people you meet there.

522
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,473
Do drugs with them, not marry them.

523
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,934
I think Larry fell in love with me
for my looks

524
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,520
and just tolerated me
for everything else.

525
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,648
Does that sound terribly vain?

526
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,193
Uh, look who you're talking to.
I'm window dressing for a window dresser.

527
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,279
But you two are happy?

528
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:20,823
Yeah.

529
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,952
He says he'd like me

530
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,496
to be older or flabbier
so that when he leaves for work,

531
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,860
he won't have to wonder
if I'll be here when he gets home.

532
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,422
Since when is Paul so insecure?

533
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,548
Mmm.

534
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,759
He gets that from you.

535
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,681
You were...

536
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,183
You were preoccupied

537
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,729
between husbands, dating,
hosting charity events.

538
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,647
I mean, look...

539
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,066
you were hurt after the divorce.

540
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,403
Right? Lost? I get that.

541
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,364
But he felt a little abandoned.

542
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,615
Well, he never told me that.

543
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,204
Hey.

544
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,542
- Hey!
- There he is.

545
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:13,752
- Hi.
- Hey.

546
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:16,838
Are you cooking?

547
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,298
Well, yeah. Mm-hmm.

548
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,635
I was falling out of love
with him,

549
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,555
but really I thought I was falling
out of love with myself, you know?

550
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:28,057
- No, not really.
- Oh, okay.

551
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,976
Think of yourself as an egg.

552
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,102
Okay, why?

553
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,314
Because the egg is you, okay?
It's your self-love, your self-worth.

554
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:38,818
You're the egg, right?
So, good love presses on the ends of you,

555
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,022
but what happens
when you press on the ends of an egg?

556
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:42,946
I don't know.

557
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,908
Nothing. Good love challenges the egg,

558
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,744
it puts pressure on the egg,
but it allows the egg to stay whole.

559
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:51,372
But what does it take
to turn a good love into bad love?

560
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,708
An expiration date.

561
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,503
No. No, no, no. The egg twists, okay?

562
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:59,714
That's it. Now, suddenly,
the pressure is on the sides of the egg.

563
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,468
- Okay? And then, what happens?
- We break the egg analogy?

564
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:06,805
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yes, Daniel. It breaks all right.

565
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,516
So, who broke your egg, Daniel?

566
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,312
<i>I waited five weeks.</i>

567
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,106
- To bang your trainer?
- Five weeks...

568
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,066
without a word.

569
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,278
I felt like you were happy
for the chance to walk away.

570
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:24,613
I came...

571
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,574
to tell you that I decided.

572
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:31,788
I always thought I had to finish my novel
first, or make something of my life.

573
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,331
Then I finally realized...

574
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,834
all I ever wanted was you,

575
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,169
and for us to be together, and...

576
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,546
maybe we'll...

577
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,924
one day have children.

578
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,511
And that would be
the purpose of our lives.

579
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,221
The best thing we'd ever do.

580
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,018
But I was wrong.

581
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,396
- No.
<i>- Daniel.</i>

582
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,065
Who broke your egg?

583
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,112
- Okay, look... Alison.
- Yep.

584
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,697
I’m here to get rid of my mother,

585
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,032
and you’re here to talk
about your ex-husband.

586
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:12,078
So, why don't we just call it over easy
and be done with it?

587
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,306
Okay, I'm going to give you
an answer to that question,

588
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,040
even though I don’t think

589
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,644
you’ll understand it, and I definitely
don't think you deserve it.

590
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,348
- You're right, I don’t deserve it.
- Okay.

591
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,214
- You don't have to tell me.
- Uh, you don't fix the egg.

592
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,885
It doesn’t matter who twisted it.
It’s broken. And you gotta let it go.

593
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:30,430
And once you’ve truly bid that egg
farewell, you’ll...

594
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,848
you'll find a new egg.

595
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:38,646
Thank you. That was, uh...
I really just need the check right now.

596
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,149
I don't think I can hear about the egg
anymore, I'm sorry.

597
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,568
All right, I was going to split the bill
with you,

598
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:46,487
but now I’m not so... thank you.

599
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,490
- Fair. Good luck with your egg hunt.
- Thank you.

600
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,079
Well,

601
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,583
I’m so glad we just finally get
to sit down and have a meal together.

602
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,252
- Mm.
- And...

603
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,380
did I mention that Paul
has never officially come out to me?

604
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,509
Shame on you, Paul.

605
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,846
You know, what is this bullshit
about having to come out?

606
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,783
It's not like straight people have
to gather their families around the table

607
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,936
when they’re 18 and find a way
to break it to them they’re heterosexual,

608
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,939
thank you, so...
why is it any different for us?

609
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:26,486
Why can’t parents just see what they see
and figure it out for themselves?

610
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,655
- No.
- It is not a sin.

611
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,491
And it is not something I need to confess.

612
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:35,161
Shut up and tell her.
She deserves the truth.

613
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,497
Do it now! This is really good, Helen.

614
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,957
Aww.

615
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,251
- Mom.
- Yeah?

616
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,044
I'm gay.

617
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,882
You’re what?
I support you and I love you!

618
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,804
All right, kiss her already.

619
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,741
- I'm not gonna go kiss her.
- Get up.

620
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:59,352
Walk over to your mother
and kiss her the way you're supposed to.

621
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,270
- Kiss.
- Here I come.

622
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,355
Oh!

623
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,107
Beautiful.

624
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:07,193
You just made my night.

625
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:10,321
Now, all you have to do
is tell your father.

626
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,907
Oh, I told him a long time ago.

627
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:14,783
What?

628
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:18,287
- Uh, I mean a while ago.
- How long ago?

629
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,416
I don’t know. A few years.

630
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,338
Why did you tell him and not me?

631
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,174
I figured you knew.

632
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:36,514
So... So, I’m punished
for being perceptive?

633
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:40,018
I would like to know why he got to have
the conversation and I didn't?

634
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,229
Mom, you just forced me to come out
to three men who know I'm gay.

635
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,815
There's no way that this moment
wasn't going to be about you.

636
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:49,527
So, maybe this is the exact reason why.

637
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:53,072
<i>This </i>has nothing to do
with you coming out to me.

638
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,034
It's just...
It has nothing to do with that.

639
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:59,328
This is about how you treat me
and your father.

640
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,081
I mean, is he always the one that's...

641
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,668
Mom, there is no you and my father.
You're divorced!

642
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,506
There’s me and him.
And there is me and you.

643
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,675
But there’s no you and him.

644
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,053
And I'm not willing to be
the you and the him,

645
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:18,723
which is what you have always wanted,
which is why you’re blowing up now.

646
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,517
There is a me and him
because there’s a you.

647
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,228
And you... You are just...

648
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,481
- You are just like him!
- Helen...

649
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,442
You know what? Please don’t compare me
to someone you despise, Mom.

650
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,694
- How about that?
- I gotta go make a phone call.

651
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,488
Oh.

652
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,578
I'm gonna go ahead
and take this with me.

653
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,705
Am I interrupting?

654
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,999
<i>No, Daniel isn't home yet.</i>

655
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,959
Oh, neither is Matt.

656
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:51,839
I feel like I’m being stood up,
and all of Tribeca knows it.

657
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:54,425
Ooh! These windows!

658
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,261
Oh, stop complaining.
I’m in a basement apartment.

659
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,597
All I see are cockroaches and feet.

660
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,977
I'll call you later
if there are any new developments.

661
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,938
<i>All right. Good night.</i>

662
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,021
Bye.

663
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,000
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry,

664
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,710
- There's nothing to be sorry about.
- I get emotional.

665
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:14,195
I know, I know. Just give it a sec, okay?

666
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:19,575
Andre said that I ruined your life

667
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,494
- and you hate me for it!
- That's...

668
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,913
Helen! No, no, no!
That's... No!

669
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,874
- Yeah.
- No. I said...

670
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,793
- When I was chopping cucumbers.
- That's...

671
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:32,338
I kind of said you have some abandonment
issues because of her. That's all.

672
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,507
That's... You told me...

673
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,218
Okay.

674
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,521
Mom.

675
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,940
Yeah?

676
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,150
Hey.

677
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,153
Yeah?

678
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,362
I love you.

679
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:03,077
Mom... I would do anything for you.

680
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,163
- Ah...
- And you know that.

681
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,333
I would like to stay here for a few nights
if that's all right.

682
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,670
- Oh, it's, um...
- Oh!

683
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,756
- Well, there's not really a guest room.
- It's okay.

684
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,028
Plague?

685
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,573
Ugh.

It smelled better at 6:00.

705
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:32,268
Mom! You were supposed to be gone!

706
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:33,894
Who said that?

707
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,397
I said, "Lock up when you leave."

708
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,232
I didn't leave yet.

709
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,777
Is this your, uh, girlfriend?

710
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,821
This is Angel.

711
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:46,157
Angel, this is Mom.

712
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,909
- Hi.
- How long have you two been together?

713
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:49,869
A while.

714
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,121
Been together about four months now.

715
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:56,667
Oh, wow!
Well, um, I'll make another plate.

716
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,919
- No. You don't need to!
- Thank you, Mrs. Walker.

717
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,713
You don’t have to call her Mrs. Walker.

718
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,841
Thank you... Mom?

719
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:06,886
Wow!

720
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,437
How the hell...

721
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,438
Did she...

722
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:29,325
Unbelievable. She just...
comes in and makes her...

723
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,707
No boundaries.

724
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,379
So, what do you do, Angel?

725
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,631
Hmm. I’m still in school.

726
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,842
Oh! Did Matt tell you
that he went to Dartmouth?

727
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,678
No. That's amazing.

728
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:50,804
Um...

729
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,474
I might take a year off to travel
before college.

730
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,017
Maybe go to Europe.

731
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,563
So, you're, um...

732
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,190
still in high school.

733
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,483
You were in a bar.

734
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,235
- I’m 18.
- You don't look it.

735
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,904
- Next month.
- Seventeen.

736
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,447
You never said that you were 17.

737
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,131
You've been dating for four months.
You don't know how old she is?

738
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,284
You forced me to lie.

739
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,471
You make it sound like I can’t be
in a long-term relation<i>...</i>

740
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,348
- I didn't force you...
- I just met her tonight, okay, Mom?

741
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,308
She was with friends drinking,
and I paid the bill.

742
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,172
I didn’t go with you
because you paid the bill.

743
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,670
He asked me to model for his magazine.

744
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,672
Yeah, because you said
you were a model.

745
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,258
I am.
I used to model children’s clothing.

746
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:30,136
Oh! When was that?
Last year?

747
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,471
I think that you should go.

748
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,808
Would you make sure she gets
into a cab, at least?

749
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:38,060
You know what?
I’d love to put you both in a cab.

750
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:39,644
It was nice to meet you.

751
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,021
Good night, Angel.

752
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,192
Happy Birthday! Next month!

753
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:47,986
No!

754
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,089
- Hey.
- Hi.

755
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:09,674
Thank you.

756
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,597
I wouldn't have yelled at her
if she were my mom.

757
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,724
- You hate your mom.
- Because she yells at me.

758
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,392
Okay.

759
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,357
- I will write her a note of apology.
- Thank you.

760
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,902
And I'll invite her to lunch
where I’ll apologize again.

761
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,530
She doesn’t really hear apologies
the first time through, so...

762
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,406
Thank you.

763
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,453
Oh! Do we have a cross
I can nail the note to?

764
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,747
Please, just write the note.
Please, just write it.

765
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,587
Mom. Mom?

766
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,800
- Mom, I said I have somebody for that.
- No, you said you’d do it.

767
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:57,306
- I’m sorry about last night.
- Why are <i>you</i> sorry?

768
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,809
- Because it was embarrassing.
- No, it wasn’t embarrassing.

769
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,604
Statutory rape,
but let’s not argue semantics.

770
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,357
It's never happened to me before.
I mean, 17.

771
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,317
- I’m not interested, Matt.
- What?

772
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,236
If you’re going to lie,
I’m not interested.

773
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,446
- I’m not lying.
- I saw your magazine.

774
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,699
- It is not about sports.
- I never said that it was.

775
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:19,245
You said it was a men’s magazine
called <i>All Balls.</i>

776
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,121
I was supposed to think scrotum?

777
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,685
That is not a word I need to hear
out of my mother's mouth.

778
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:26,085
You are not the demographic.

779
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:29,255
Well, that much is clear.
So, now I know the truth about you.

780
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:32,383
My job has nothing to do
with that girl being underage. Young...

781
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:34,760
Younger than she has a right to be.

782
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,638
- So, how old is she, do you think?
- I don’t know, Mom.

783
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,682
- Well, you're the editor.
- I'm the art director.

784
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,226
I design the look and the feel
of <i>All Balls.</i>

785
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,562
The magazine.

786
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,480
So, it reflects your taste?

787
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,274
It’s my job, Mom.

788
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,192
A job that I’m very good at.

789
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,611
To tailor the content to our audience.

790
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,990
And our audience happens to be young men,
and young men like young women.

791
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,617
This is not a magazine
for under the mattress.

792
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,620
We are <i>Vanity Fair</i> with half the brain
and twice the body.

793
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,163
We are totally mainstream.

794
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:06,000
Well, your father and I didn’t raise you
to be mainstream.

795
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,252
We raised you to be exceptional.

796
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:11,213
- If your father were alive...
- What, he'd be disappointed?

797
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,383
Because, God forbid, I have to live
up to his standards, right?

798
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,427
But he’s not here, Mom.

799
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,263
So, why are you still taking his side?

800
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,726
What are you talking about?

801
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:29,273
How come you never came
to any of my basketball games?

802
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,573
That was your time with your father.
He was the coach. You were the star.

803
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:39,116
I still have every trophy,
and you have to know how proud I was

804
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,744
- of every single win.
- What about when we lost?

805
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,538
- Well, you didn’t lose very often.
- No, I didn't lose very often

806
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,915
because according to Dad
failure was not an option.

807
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:48,917
But apparently, now, it is.

808
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:52,379
- You are not a failure.
- No, I know that I'm not a failure.

809
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:53,982
So, why are you still lecturing me?

810
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,425
I just want you to expect
more from your life.

811
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:59,094
Make the most of your time
on this planet.

812
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,431
I’m not the one who's still living
in the same house.

813
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:14,652
<i>Ma, did you break in
to my apartment and steal my vodka?</i>

814
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,029
Vodka?

815
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:19,907
That's crazy talk.

816
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:24,411
Hey, we were supposed to have dinner.
I baked you a pie.

817
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,789
I was on your date last night.

818
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,749
What? How was it?

819
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,043
I’d rather be bitten by the dog again.

820
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:35,714
I had such hopes for that girl
from Yonkers.

821
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,510
You know, sometimes it's the second date
when the magic happens.

822
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,771
You want to meet me at the Met after work?

823
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,106
Uh, I can't.

824
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,566
I have a party at One Oak tonight.

825
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,945
A product launch for a shampoo/body wash.

826
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,905
- Are mothers invited?
- No.

827
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:02,157
I mean, no, it's, uh...

828
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,244
guest list only,
and you've got to RSVP.

829
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:08,997
It's not even a party.

830
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:12,584
It’s work. And I shouldn’t have even said
it was a party.

831
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:26,765
It's good to see you, Mom. Love you!

832
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,310
And if you decide to leave, just lock up.

833
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,020
Like I said.

834
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,189
I'm not leaving.

835
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,399
Okay.

836
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,406
Look. Oh, it has little bees.

837
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:46,118
Oh, cute.
My gosh, can you imagine?

838
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,622
It's sort of just...
What do we know about this party?

839
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:53,709
- There’s a list, apparently.
- For a shampoo?

840
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:56,628
Ugh! I feel naked.

841
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,673
Where have you been hiding those?

842
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,550
I try to de-emphasize.

843
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:04,011
Why? They’re spectacular.

844
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,013
Oh, is this appropriate, you think?

845
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,974
That dress,
or crashing your son’s work party?

846
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:12,186
Matt brought home
a girl almost half his age.

847
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,939
Well, Larry married a girl almost
half his age. It's just what men do.

848
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,733
Oh...

849
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,485
- How about these?
- Mmm.

850
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,779
Matt, he doesn't listen to me anymore.

851
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:24,782
So, I’m trying to listen to him.

852
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:29,286
I’m trying to understand his life here,
support what he wants.

853
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,038
Is that going too far?

854
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,121
No.

855
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,875
- That is admirable.
- Yes.

856
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:39,546
You should go to that party,
and you should wear this fabulous dress.

857
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,049
And we should get your hair done.

858
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,926
Oh!

859
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,637
That's her.

860
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:49,348
- Okay, well, is she any good?
- I don’t know.

861
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,308
- Carol it’s time.
- Time for what?

862
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,643
- A new look.
- Yeah.

863
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:55,229
Now, come on.
I got to meet Paul for lunch at 1:00.

864
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,732
- Hi, I'm Erin.
- Oh!

865
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:00,864
And I see you brought your girl...
Oh, my gosh.

866
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,529
- Oh!
- Mrs. Lieberman.

867
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,989
How crazy.

868
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:10,410
Erin! Yes, it’s Gillian.
And this is Carol and Helen.

869
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,204
- Hi.
- Hello.

870
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:14,581
- I... I know this is weird.
- Yep.

871
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,959
And I'm sorry. But it was Carol.

872
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,961
- Carol wants a makeover.
- No.

873
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:22,548
No, I did not say "makeover," okay?

874
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,008
Look, um, I'm going to a party tonight.

875
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,802
But first things first,

876
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:30,055
I need to know what is your experience
with my texture of hair?

877
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:33,141
- Oh, yeah. I do all types of hair.
- See?

878
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,520
You're the perfect stylist.

879
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:37,603
Perfect.

880
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:38,980
Okay.

881
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,189
Okay.

882
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,277
Right?

883
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,821
Does Daniel know you’re here?

884
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,991
Uh, no. This is all me.

885
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:51,493
But I remember
that you'd mentioned this salon

886
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,620
when we had brunch that one time.

887
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:57,749
Right, and then you asked me
what I wanted to be when I grew up.

888
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,458
Jesus.

889
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,044
Did I?

890
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:02,713
Eek!

891
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:05,132
Oh! I'm so sorry.

892
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,217
Anyhoo, I just...

893
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:11,346
- Get Carol started.
- Oh, no, no. No rush.

894
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:12,973
Let's not cut angry.

895
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,225
I'm sorry. Did I say that I'm sorry?

896
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:18,437
Yeah, no, three times now.
So, I think we're good.

897
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,147
Okay.

898
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,566
So, Carol.

899
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,202
- Yes?
- Are you open to a new shape?

900
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,445
She is.

901
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,780
Well, nothing severe.

902
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:32,618
You know, Finn always loved my hair
just the way that it is, so...

903
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,954
Well, you have a beautiful face.
We should frame your face

904
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:39,333
And I think we gotta rock these curls.

905
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,795
Hello!

906
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,261
- That's good.
- You're my first cut.

907
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:54,848
Okay, put your head back.

908
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,186
What do you think?

909
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:06,193
Oh, my gosh! If you looked any younger,
Matt would date you.

910
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,200
You’re a miracle worker.

911
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,113
- No.
- Really? Was it that tired?

912
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,951
Erin, thank you. I love it.

913
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,452
I just helped you be you.

914
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:21,750
Look, Erin, I really have to apologize.

915
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:22,668
Again?

916
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,879
Yes, again.
I should have tried harder before.

917
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,799
Listen, maybe I could take
you and Daniel out to lunch,

918
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:30,759
or maybe you could do my hair?

919
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:33,762
Now, you volunteer. Thank you.

920
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:36,473
No, I'm actually moving next week.

921
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,183
What? Why? Where?

922
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:42,145
My friend has a salon in Los Angeles,
so, I’m gonna try the other coast.

923
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:46,066
But it was so good to see you again.
And enjoy your party, Carol.

924
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,652
Well, how can I not now?

925
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,654
- Thank you.
- Nice to meet you, Erin.

926
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:51,989
How is he?

927
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,157
He's, uh...

928
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:57,744
Yeah, well, you know, been better.

929
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,662
With you...

930
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,205
he was better.

931
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,542
Till I broke his heart.

932
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,587
But he broke mine first.

933
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,090
So, we’re even.

934
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,800
He did.

935
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,017
One thing I do know,

936
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:23,979
the problem is not that I meddled,
it's that I should've meddled sooner.

937
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:26,273
Mm-mmm. I wouldn’t tell him that.

938
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,817
There’s Paul. There's Paul.

939
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,404
Look at him. He's so handsome.

940
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:35,240
We're not even here.
Go enjoy your apology.

941
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,886
- Hi.
- I don't want him to see us.

942
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,305
We're middle-aged women
in Manhattan. We're practically invisible.

943
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:43,331
Oh.

944
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:44,957
Thank you.

945
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,376
Thank you.

946
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,757
- You were so thoughtful with the note.
- Oh.

947
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,341
Was that Andre's idea?

948
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:56,469
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

949
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:59,556
I'm gonna have what she's having.
Without the taunting.

950
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,350
Listen, I'm...

951
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:05,854
really sorry I attacked you last night
about Dad.

952
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,816
Yeah. Okay.

953
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,610
- Yes.
- Sorry.

954
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:13,695
Um...

955
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:17,908
it's just not my problem
if you can't let go.

956
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,120
Oh, I usually get the fish.

957
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,039
Aww.

958
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:27,167
- So...
- What do you mean I can't let go?

959
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,504
I'm just saying that's the issue.

960
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:33,173
Well, you’re absolutely wrong.

961
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,176
I am happily married
to someone I am in love with.

962
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,470
I will believe anything you tell me.

963
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,515
Please stop patronizing me. Thank you.

964
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,016
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

965
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,104
I’m not patronizing. I’m apologizing.

966
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:50,315
So, accusing me of having a sham marriage
is what you call an apology?

967
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:52,567
I’m not accusing you of anything.

968
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,861
I’m just trying to apologize.

969
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,197
You know, it's what you always do.

970
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,658
You always make
some outrageous accusation

971
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:02,035
and then you act
as if I’m being hypersensitive

972
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,495
to notice that you’ve said it.

973
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:06,957
- Ahh.
- It's a tiny observation.

974
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,792
It's something that was obvious to me.

975
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,853
Mom, if I was wrong,
you wouldn't be so upset.

976
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:13,088
Mom! Oh, my...

977
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,756
- We should go.
- Don't...

978
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,100
We should go!

979
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,928
You should be ashamed of yourself.

980
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:22,055
Carol Walker?

981
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,145
Oh. Oh.

982
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:29,813
Gillian Lieberman.

983
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,483
I don’t know why she didn’t tell you
that we're in town,

984
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,361
but I certainly wouldn't use
the word "conspiracy."

985
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:39,865
My feelings, or lack of them,
toward my husband and my ex-husband,

986
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,951
- are really none of your business.
- I didn't say they were.

987
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,786
- That was meant for me.
- Oh.

988
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,997
And you have no place speculating

989
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,458
on what I may or may not
be thinking or feeling,

990
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:54,379
Especially when your speculations
are inaccurate and deeply hurtful.

991
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:55,964
You are absolutely right.

992
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,174
Subject closed.

993
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,508
- Thank God.
- Yeah.

994
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,052
I think Carol and I should get going now.

995
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,722
Well, there's one more thing
I wanted to tell you.

996
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:06,558
Just... get everything out on the table.

997
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:09,561
Didn't want you to hear it from
somebody else or somebody else's son.

998
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:12,397
Or if I even needed to tell you
'cause it doesn't really involve you.

999
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:14,167
Just, come on, spit it out.

1000
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:16,860
I... might not...

1001
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,905
have children of my own.

1002
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:21,781
That much I figured.

1003
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,575
Gay people have children
all the time, Mom.

1004
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,952
- Do you want children?
- No, I do not.

1005
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,246
The point is that gay men have...

1006
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:31,750
sperm, and lesbians have wombs
and we don’t need straight people

1007
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,878
- to tell us what we can or can’t do.
- What?

1008
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,505
This is why I didn’t tell you.

1009
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:41,343
You are too young
to make a decision like this.

1010
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:44,095
- A decision like what?
- Two mommies and a sperm-daddy.

1011
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:47,098
- Right?
- Mom, what I’m saying is...

1012
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:52,229
if I lent my sperm
to two women that I knew and trusted,

1013
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:55,941
then I would know that the child
would be loved and cared for...

1014
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:59,194
Are you saying you weren't loved?
Are you trying to make me feel guilty?

1015
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,029
This has nothing to do with you.

1016
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,823
- This is about me!
- And the gift you're giving your friends?

1017
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,493
Yes. The gift I am giving my friends,
which I feel good about

1018
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,453
because I love them,
and they love the baby.

1019
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:10,621
Oh.

1020
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,311
- Did he say "baby"?
- You have a baby?

1021
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,920
There's a baby?

1022
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,852
What did you think we were talking about?

1023
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:22,759
Sperm!
I thought we were talking about sperm!

1024
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:26,221
A baby takes nine months.
You've kept this from me for nine months?

1025
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:29,891
- Mom, the more of a scene...
- This has been a lovely lunch,

1026
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,143
even though we didn’t have lunch.
So don't get up.

1027
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:34,813
Please, just sit there and have more...
<i>not </i>your children,

1028
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,731
so I can have more <i>not </i>my grandchildren

1029
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:38,441
And we can get together
for the holidays

1030
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,485
and have one big, not-happy, not-a-family,

1031
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:43,196
because I’m not a mother anymore,
I’m an other.

1032
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,049
- And now I am not a grandmother...
- What is...

1033
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:46,866
...I’m a grand-other!

1034
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,221
- Helen, sweetie.
- Your hair looks very nice, Carol.

1035
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,454
Well, thank you, Paul.

1036
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:54,291
But that was not an apology.

1037
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:58,335
Helen!

1038
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:03,258
I thought you didn’t want to be
a grandmother.

1039
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:07,345
Well, I just don't want things
to be taken away from me.

1040
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:08,846
I mean,

1041
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:11,933
now someone else gets my grandchild.

1042
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:14,978
Just like someone else got my husband.

1043
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,689
How did this become about Larry?

1044
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,692
Because divorce is not fair.

1045
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:25,363
Divorce is great for men.
They get someone younger,

1046
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,073
thinner, better,

1047
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:31,870
and women get someone older
and fatter with thinner hair!

1048
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,955
Sure.

1049
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:36,708
I got a text from Daniel.

1050
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,545
"Stop calling me." Ugh.

1051
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:42,881
What should I reply?

1052
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,799
Please, don’t reply.

1053
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:46,134
Let's just...

1054
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:49,471
Let's just go home
before we do any more damage.

1055
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,765
No. Carol.

1056
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,851
You and your boobs are going out.
And I don’t mean me and Helen.

1057
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:57,812
Yeah. Carol, you go out and have fun.

1058
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:02,650
I wish Larry had died on me, too.

1059
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,574
You should think more about what you say

1060
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,618
and less about what you feel.

1061
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,661
So sorry.

1062
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,791
What did I say?

1063
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,835
- What?
- Really?

1064
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,469
Oh, hi. Excuse me.

1065
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,053
Um...

1066
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,723
I'm a guest of Matt Walker.

1067
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,558
Do you have him on the list?

1068
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:37,894
He's<i> All Balls.</i>

1069
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,437
Uh, the magazine.

1070
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:43,191
- It's a magazine.
- Yeah. I know Matt.

1071
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,152
Uh, he's already checked in.
He doesn't have a plus one.

1072
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:49,656
Oh! I'm his mother. Carol Walker.

1073
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,325
I have a driver's license.

1074
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,078
- Um, there.
- Oh.

1075
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:58,415
Oh! And a picture of Matt in the tub
when he was three.

1076
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,750
Ah! Does he have a woody?

1077
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:05,171
Oh, no! That's a toy boat.

1078
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,006
Oh, my God.

1079
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,220
It's for Instagram.

1080
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,720
Oh!

1081
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:15,682
She's good.

1094
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:07,275
Ohh! I ruined your dress.
I'm so sorry.

1095
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,861
- I never liked this dress.
- Oh, it's all my fault.

1096
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:11,488
I was running from my son.

1097
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,824
I'm Julia.

1098
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,160
Carol. Walker.

1099
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:19,329
Why are you running from your son?

1100
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,706
He told me I couldn't come.

1101
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,709
- That's not nice.
- Oh, maybe it was.

1102
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:27,337
Maybe he knew everyone here
would be 30 years younger,

1103
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,381
and I would feel like the last dinosaur.

1104
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,594
- Well, thank you, Damon. Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

1105
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:39,224
Damon, Damon, Damon.

1106
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:42,769
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.
Would a grandma wear these?

1107
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:45,647
No. Especially not to bed.

1108
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:49,067
We are not going to bed,
we are going clubbing.

1109
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:52,403
I didn’t go clubbing
when I was supposed to go clubbing.

1110
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,072
Would we even get into a club?

1111
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:57,283
Well, I didn’t think I’d get
into these jeans and look at me now.

1112
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,494
- Can you breathe?
- Sporadically.

1113
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:02,080
Come on. Let's go downstairs.

1114
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:04,624
This hotel is supposed to be
a huge party scene.

1115
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,209
Just call for a bellboy.

1116
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:09,462
One's more gorgeous than the next,
and they come to you.

1117
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,131
I know. You’ve called for ice twice.

1118
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,800
Just fuck one of them already.

1119
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,677
What? I'm thirsty.

1120
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:20,181
Come on, we are in New York City.
Let's go.

1121
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,809
Okay. Let me take a shower.

1122
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:24,352
Yes!

1123
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:25,687
I think this might be him.

1124
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,981
Is he the most handsome guy in the room?

1125
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:30,024
He's got swagger.

1126
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:35,363
That's him.

1127
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:37,282
I can’t talk to him right now.

1128
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:41,202
Matt... has never seen me drunk.

1129
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:46,708
So, tell me more about this non-profit
that you're working with.

1130
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,126
It's called micro lending.

1131
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:51,546
We provide small loans
for the world's poorest of the poor.

1132
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,924
Mostly women. So they can work
their own way out of poverty.

1133
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,845
I want you to give my son a child.

1134
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,430
Oh!

1135
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:05,685
Matt, he may seem vain and superficial,

1136
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:10,648
and so afraid of any real emotion
that it makes you cry.

1137
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,110
But he's basically good.

1138
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:19,073
He has it in him to be a really good man.

1139
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:24,787
I need you to show him
how to be that man.

1140
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:29,167
I think we should get you home.

1141
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,252
Let's dance.

1142
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:34,172
I used to love to dance.

1143
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,222
Matt's dad used to take me dancing.

1144
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:47,185
He's dead now. That's why he stopped.

1145
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,232
Mom!

1146
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:54,900
What are you...

1147
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,279
What is all this?
What happened to your hair?

1148
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,615
And mom, you did not have those
this morning.

1149
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:02,659
Oh, Matt...

1150
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:05,953
I’m in love with Julia!

1151
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:10,166
I love her. I think you might, too.

1152
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:16,339
Okay, let go of her hand.
She is my mother.

1153
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:18,966
Dancing does not make you a lesbian.

1154
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,844
Your dad liked lesbians, by the way.

1155
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:24,305
I found his videos after he died.

1156
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:27,433
Please, please, stop talking.
And dancing.

1157
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:30,770
Let's... You know what?
Let's just get you into a cab.

1158
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:33,773
You get into a cab!
I’m having dessert.

1159
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:37,985
Ohh! I might stay out all night.

1160
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:40,238
I may drink from a shoe.

1161
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,741
I was a girl before I was your mother.

1162
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,455
All right, does this outfit work?
I mean outside of Poughkeepsie.

1163
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,425
- Hey.
<i>- Gillian, oh!</i>

1164
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,427
<i>I need my friends.</i>

1165
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:06,389
- He barely recognized me.
- Because of your new look?

1166
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:08,933
No! Because I was having fun!

1167
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:11,602
- That’s what we were supposed to do.
- You passed out.

1168
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:14,105
By the way, you have incredible
new beauty products.

1169
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:15,940
Yeah. It’s all anti-aging.

1170
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:18,192
Why is everyone anti-aging?

1171
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:21,070
You know what’s anti-aging?
Death.

1172
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,864
Let's be happy we're aging.

1173
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:23,781
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1174
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,032
By the way,

1175
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:29,245
do you know how long it’s been
since I have had...

1176
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:30,328
Sex?

1177
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:32,498
I was gonna say pizza.

1178
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:33,583
Oh.

1179
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:34,876
Oh.

1180
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,379
Wow.

1181
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:40,590
I’m not going home tonight.

1182
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,508
I mean, Matt's home.

1183
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,135
I'm on vacation.

1184
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:47,018
- So, we’re done with the mission?
- Mm, we have a new mission.

1185
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,599
Dance till dawn.

1186
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,478
Did we fail the first mission?

1187
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:56,814
- Fuck the first mission!
- What about the boys?

1188
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:58,691
Fuck the boys!

1189
01:02:58,775 --> 01:02:59,901
Wow!

1190
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:03,488

Oh, it's you.

1219
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:55,308
Your mother left this in the cab.

1220
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:58,435
Thank you.

1221
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:00,438
Do you know where she is?

1222
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,565
Sleeping. It's early.

1223
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:04,483
- Is she?
- Isn't she?

1224
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:06,485
This isn't where I dropped her.

1225
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:09,280
I got your address from her phone.

1226
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:16,912
Mom?

1227
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:20,416
Okay, where did you drop her?

1228
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:23,377
At a pizza place in the Village.
She was meeting friends.

1229
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:25,129
She doesn't eat pizza.

1230
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,840
And she doesn't have any friends
in the Village.

1231
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,650
And the hair, and the dress.
Like she...

1232
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:32,178
wanted people to look at her.
That's not my mother.

1233
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:33,763
Okay, she doesn't even like dancing.

1234
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:35,431
She loves to dance.

1235
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:40,769
Right.

1236
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:44,899
Uh, my name and number
are on a napkin in the phone case.

1237
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:48,211
I'd like to know she's okay.

1238
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,117
Wait. Hey. Hi, Mrs. B.

1239
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:56,576
Julia.

1240
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,038
Look, thanks. That was...

1241
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:01,665
That was nice.

1242
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,377
Great photo on Instagram, by the way.

1243
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:05,710
What?

1244
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:13,719
Is that someone knocking?

1245
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,156
Or is it just my head pounding?

1246
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:19,058
- You go, Gill. Go.
- Why me?

1247
01:06:20,267 --> 01:06:21,267
Okay.

1248
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:27,400
What is it?

1249
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:28,567
- Hey, Mom.
- Daniel.

1250
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:30,027
- Excuse me.
- What?

1251
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:31,486
Matt?

1252
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:33,479
- They're here.
- Yeah.

1253
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,032
- Mom!
- Hmm.

1254
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,617
Mom!

1255
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:39,787
Is this why you couldn't make a call, hmm?
Your new friend dropped this off.

1256
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:42,873
We were worried sick.

1257
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:46,669
- Did I invite any of you in?
- Did we invite any of you to New York?

1258
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:50,339
Could everyone just please stop shouting?
I have a hangover.

1259
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:54,260
Aww. Yeah, Mom, that's what happens
when you get drunk at my work party.

1260
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,263
And now there is a naked picture
of me on Instagram.

1261
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:00,307
- I had nothing to do with a naked picture.
- In the tub.

1262
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,519
Oh, yeah, well, I just showed one person.

1263
01:07:03,602 --> 01:07:05,163
We’re allowed to be in New York.

1264
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:07,398
I had no idea where you were last night.

1265
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:10,109
I had no idea I had a grandchild,
so we’re even.

1266
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:12,820
I told her.

1267
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:16,615
See, Paul talks to his mom.
Why did you break up with Erin?

1268
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:19,204
Ma, yesterday you told me
you were checking out.

1269
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:20,494
Why are you still here again?

1270
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:23,664
- Wait, hang on. You’ve been in a hotel?
- Why? Is that a crime?

1271
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:25,082
Why didn’t you stay in a hotel?

1272
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:27,418
Well, Helen and Gillian wouldn't let me.

1273
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:29,003
Why? What’s wrong with a hotel?

1274
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:32,590
I’ll tell you what’s wrong with this one.
The security stinks.

1275
01:07:32,673 --> 01:07:35,301
Would you put on a robe at least?

1276
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:36,886
What do you care? You’re gay. Here.

1277
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:39,430
You know what? I'm gay, not blind.

1278
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:41,640
Okay, Matt. I’ll see you at home.

1279
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,059
Your home is in Poughkeepsie!

1280
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,061
- That's not nice.
- I'm sorry.

1281
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:49,607
- Ugh.
- Bye, Ma.

1282
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:55,696
- I wanted to see those since I was ten.
- Those are some nice titties.

1283
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:58,908
- Can we not talk about my mom's breasts?
- She's a lovely lady.

1284
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:01,827
- Let's talk about going to lunch.
- How about we...

1285
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,245
talk about Woody Walker?

1286
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:05,223
- Oh, my God.
- You should be proud.

1287
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:08,209
- It was a toy boat!
- A penis-shaped toy boat?

1288
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:10,753
- Seventy-thousand likes?
- Oh, let me see that.

1289
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:15,382
I am so mad at her.

1290
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:17,384
Just breathe. Stop.

1291
01:08:21,555 --> 01:08:22,640
I forgive you.

1292
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:25,476
Okay, good.

1293
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:29,271
Did you tell Larry he has a grandchild?

1294
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:31,774
I’m gonna go to the store.

1295
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:34,777
Yes. And he respected my decision.

1296
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:36,237
I'm sure he did.

1297
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:39,907
It does not matter anyway, Mom.

1298
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:42,451
Dad does not have a grandchild.

1299
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:44,787
- You do not have a grandchild.
- I know.

1300
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,832
I do not have a daughter.
This was sperm only.

1301
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:50,209
Oh, Paul, it's a girl?

1302
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:55,256
I'm going home.

1303
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:57,424
I shouldn't have come.

1304
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:01,262
Well, what did you think
was going to happen, Ma?

1305
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:04,723
I thought you wouldn't let me in.

1306
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:06,391
That was an option?

1307
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:09,102
You’re popular.

1308
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,147
You're successful.

1309
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:14,108
Mom, you're making it sound so depressing.

1310
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:17,486
No. This is what’s supposed
to happen to children.

1311
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:20,406
You’re fully independent.

1312
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:23,409
Mom, why does it feel
like we’re breaking up?

1313
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:26,328
Matthew, I need to tell you something.

1314
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:30,624
Your dad didn’t want me at your games.
That’s why I didn’t go.

1315
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:36,088
I thought he drove you too hard.
And we would argue about it,

1316
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:39,216
and finally he said,
"Well, stop coming if it bothers you."

1317
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:41,426
And so I did.

1318
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:45,556
And then all the trophies
started rolling in

1319
01:09:45,639 --> 01:09:48,475
and I thought he was right
and I was wrong.

1320
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:52,438
And now it turns out that I was right.

1321
01:09:54,231 --> 01:09:57,193
And what's so ironic is that...

1322
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:01,655
you did need me then,
and you don’t need me now.

1323
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:03,949
I'm fine.

1324
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:07,036
Right? I turned out fine, right?

1325
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:08,119
Matthew...

1326
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:10,789
you know who you are without me.

1327
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:16,045
I need to figure out
who I am without you.

1328
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:32,728
So, apparently, the one
who didn't carry the baby

1329
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:35,564
is saying that <i>her </i>mother
is the daddy granny.

1330
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:38,275
So... I'm not anything.

1331
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:41,362
And they even had the gall to tell Paul

1332
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:43,989
they didn’t want me to even see Ella.

1333
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,283
- Well, what changed their mind?
- Nothing.

1334
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:49,578
And you know what is most unfair?
I always wanted a girl.

1335
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:52,790
Larry was one and done,
but I would’ve had three if we...

1336
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:55,668
Wait, why are we here
if you can’t see the kid?

1337
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:58,712
I could be hijacking
Erin’s moving van right now.

1338
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:02,091
- It’s not a perfect plan, but it’s a plan.
- I thought we were going home.

1339
01:11:02,174 --> 01:11:04,593
Yeah, we are.
We’re just stopping in Cobble Hill first.

1340
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:08,180
I convinced Paul to give me the address,
and I don’t want to show up empty-handed.

1341
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:11,850
Well, we weren’t wanted by our sons.
That didn’t stop us.

1342
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:14,937
Yeah, I am so tired of being stopped.

1343
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:19,400
Larry said if it meant so much to me
to have a girl, I should’ve had twins.

1344
01:11:19,483 --> 01:11:21,485
Larry, Larry, Larry! Enough with Larry!

1345
01:11:21,568 --> 01:11:24,363
We never want to hear his name again.
We never even liked him.

1346
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:29,660
Look, you’ve been divorced
from that idiot for 11 years.

1347
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:32,371
You still talk about him
in the present tense.

1348
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:34,957
You're wasting a good marriage,

1349
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,293
because you refuse
to let go of a bad one.

1350
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:38,585
What about baby yoga mats?

1351
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:40,629
Are you jealous?
Is that what this is about?

1352
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:41,839
- What?
- You’re jealous

1353
01:11:41,922 --> 01:11:44,466
that I’m the one that has a grandchild.

1354
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:48,012
Helen, we are thrilled
that you get to meet Ella today.

1355
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:50,973
I think what Gillian is trying to say

1356
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:53,267
is that you have something special
in Frank.

1357
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:57,146
The way he looks at you,
the way he talks about you.

1358
01:11:57,229 --> 01:12:01,525
You have no idea how fortunate you are
to have Frank instead of Larry.

1359
01:12:01,608 --> 01:12:04,570
We're not jealous of you.
Paul went in a room and jerked off.

1360
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:07,053
If that makes you a grandmother,
then we're all grandmothers.

1361
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:09,992
Let's stop, all right?
We have already pissed off our sons.

1362
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:12,119
We are all that we have left.

1363
01:12:13,203 --> 01:12:16,081
Jealous? Oh, my God.

1364
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:18,542
What is wrong with you, Helen?

1365
01:12:22,087 --> 01:12:23,464
Okay. Okay.

1366
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:25,299
I'm gonna tell you what’s wrong.

1367
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:27,384
And it has been brewing for 11 years.

1368
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:29,720
You know why I divorced Larry, right?

1369
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:31,156
Yeah. He cheated on you.

1370
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:35,309
Yeah. It was that year our husbands went
on that fishing trip to the Berkshires.

1371
01:12:35,392 --> 01:12:36,518
Okay, Helen. You win.

1372
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:40,064
And Larry had a fuck buddy up there
and I found out about it.

1373
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:43,359
And I had the courage
and the self-dignity to leave.

1374
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:45,322
He was paying her rent
from Paul's college fund.

1375
01:12:45,819 --> 01:12:47,571
She was an anorexic blonde vegan.

1376
01:12:47,654 --> 01:12:50,949
And she had a friend
for Gillian’s husband.

1377
01:12:51,992 --> 01:12:54,870
Joel cheated on Gillian
just like Larry cheated on me,

1378
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:56,330
but she forgave him!

1379
01:12:56,413 --> 01:13:00,918
I don’t expect you to understand
why I forgave Joel.

1380
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:03,921
Because the only person
you’ve ever truly loved is yourself.

1381
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,380
Not Larry,

1382
01:13:05,422 --> 01:13:08,717
and not Frank, and not Carol, or me, or...

1383
01:13:08,967 --> 01:13:12,846
- your new sperm-daughter.
- Not even your own son!

1384
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:17,017
The only person you ever loved was you.

1385
01:13:18,018 --> 01:13:21,355
Okay. Well, if you are
so much better at loving,

1386
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:25,150
then why is your son the one who’s broke,
depressed, and jobless?

1387
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:27,444
Hmm? I’ll tell you why.

1388
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:30,739
Because you sabotaged
his chance at happiness.

1389
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,825
That is bullshit, and you know it.

1390
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:34,576
Is it? He had a ring.

1391
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:38,956
But you, you planted so many doubts.

1392
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:41,083
Not just about Erin, but about himself.

1393
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:43,627
So that when he finally had the balls
to propose,

1394
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:45,796
he caught Erin <i>schtupping </i>her trainer.

1395
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:47,589
I think Daniel would have mentioned...

1396
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,633
He didn’t want to give you
the satisfaction.

1397
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:53,262
You hated Erin until ten minutes ago.
Paul told me.

1398
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:55,055
Did you know about this?

1399
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:03,063
I think Matt mentioned something
once about a ring.

1400
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:05,774
Helen, about that fishing trip...

1401
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:09,278
- Carol, let's just go now.
- And Paul jerked off to create a person.

1402
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:11,613
Helen, in the Berkshires...

1403
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:17,161
did the vegan have someone for Finn?

1404
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:21,748
I’m sorry. She was full of friends.

1405
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:31,341
All this time...

1406
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:34,803
and neither of you said anything to me.

1407
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:40,893
And I thought we were friends.

1408
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:44,437
Oh, fuck.

1409
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:46,190
You’re taking a train home.

1410
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:50,194
Oh... Please, don't leave.

1411
01:14:50,694 --> 01:14:55,699
You guys, I'm sorry. Carol, I'm sorry!
Gillian, wait! Don't leave!

1412
01:14:56,116 --> 01:14:59,578
Oh, that was bad!!

1413
01:15:59,137 --> 01:16:01,390
Open the door
or I'm gonna start singing.

1414
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:05,519
Do you need directions home?
I can show you how to Waze.

1415
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:08,522
I don't want the government tracking me.

1416
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:11,483
- Would it kill you to answer your phone?
- I've been working.

1417
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:13,652
- On what?
- My novel.

1418
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,654
I finally got inspired.

1419
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:18,337
It’s about an overbearing mother.
It’s called <i>Baking and Entering.</i>

1420
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:21,201
Daniel, this is important.

1421
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:23,203
Do you still have the ring?

1422
01:16:26,206 --> 01:16:27,206
What ring?

1423
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,835
The one you were planning on giving Erin.

1424
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:33,255
Honey, why didn't you say anything?

1425
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:36,592
Well, you never liked her anyway, Ma.
So, what's the difference?

1426
01:16:37,342 --> 01:16:41,221
Wha... Well, what do I know?
I’m just some weird internet stalker.

1427
01:16:42,347 --> 01:16:43,557
And I was wrong.

1428
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:46,160
I always wondered what it'd be like
to hear you say those words.

1429
01:16:46,184 --> 01:16:48,478
And is it turns out,
you were actually right. So...

1430
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:49,562
No.

1431
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:53,025
She's a lovely woman,
and you're a lovely man.

1432
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:56,278
So, if you have that ring,

1433
01:16:57,112 --> 01:16:59,364
and if she is the love of your life,

1434
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:02,909
then do something before it is too late.

1435
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:07,623
Because for all you know, she might
be packing her bags and leaving town...

1436
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:09,082
or something.

1437
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:14,421
I love you. You're a grown man.

1438
01:17:15,547 --> 01:17:18,759
I just hope you do what is best
for your life and your future.

1439
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:20,927
Did you see her somewhere or something?

1440
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,430
Ma, wait.

1441
01:17:23,847 --> 01:17:26,224
Mom, did you break in to her place, too?

1442
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:26,785
Is there a reason you're following me?

1443
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:31,104
Paul said you wouldn’t listen to us.

1444
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,334
It's okay, honey. It's okay.

1445
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:37,587
What is it that you want?

1446
01:18:39,756 --> 01:18:40,756
I...

1447
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:43,635
I don't want... anything.

1448
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,887
I'm not asking for anything.

1449
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:48,473
I'm just saying what I am.

1450
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:51,225
A grandmother.

1451
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:54,062
She has grandmothers.

1452
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:01,069
I brought...

1453
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:02,153
a few...

1454
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:05,699
hundred gifts.

1455
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,537
Look, we talked about this
before the birth.

1456
01:19:10,662 --> 01:19:15,167
We adore Paul. We do,
and we want Ella to know Paul.

1457
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:18,503
We hope she gets some of his great
qualities. That’s why we chose him.

1458
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:21,047
But he's not the dad.

1459
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:22,424
He's a sperm donor.

1460
01:19:22,507 --> 01:19:24,926
Okay, we all agreed. We signed papers.

1461
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:29,930
But...

1462
01:19:30,807 --> 01:19:32,267
now that I have her...

1463
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:35,562
and now that I know
what it feels like...

1464
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:39,191
when she has a baby, if...

1465
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:41,568
she has a baby...

1466
01:19:42,527 --> 01:19:44,279
if I couldn’t see that baby...

1467
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:49,576
I’d probably chase that baby
all over the city, too.

1468
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:55,665
Aww, it's okay, honey.

1469
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,676
She looks just like Paul did.

1470
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:12,182
Would you like to hold her?

1471
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:17,979
- Say hi.
- Hi.

1472
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:20,816
Aww.

1473
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,401
Hi.

1474
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:27,322
- Hi.
- That's a good girl.

1475
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:29,950
I want to be a good grandmother.

1476
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:32,160
Not a bad one.

1477
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:39,501
Honey, five weeks is not late.

1478
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:41,837
Five weeks is abandonment.

1479
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:44,714
Sounds like she waited
a long time for you.

1480
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:46,508
All right, Ma. You know what?

1481
01:20:46,591 --> 01:20:49,719
You and Dad have, like,
your perfect story, so, you wouldn't...

1482
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:51,930
No. There is no perfect story.

1483
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:54,099
In fact...

1484
01:20:56,393 --> 01:21:00,146
years ago, your father had an infidelity.

1485
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:11,157
Before I was born or after?

1486
01:21:13,326 --> 01:21:15,453
You were 16.

1487
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,375
How did you forgive him?

1488
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:24,462
It wasn't easy.

1489
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:28,466
I went crazy for a little while.
I went on this...

1490
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:31,887
facacta five-week egg diet.
You remember?

1491
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:35,098
Yes, I do. You were, like,
you wanted chickens or something.

1492
01:21:35,181 --> 01:21:36,558
- Yeah.
- A chicken coop?

1493
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:38,142
Ah!

1494
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:40,604
But, I realized...

1495
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:43,273
I still wanted your dad.

1496
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:48,278
And I decided to do
the harder thing instead.

1497
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:53,074
But I think what really...

1498
01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:56,536
made it possible for me to forgive him

1499
01:21:57,287 --> 01:21:58,287
was...

1500
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:00,874
he never fully forgave himself.

1501
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:05,629
Mom, I really admire you.

1502
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:09,466
And I get why you're sharing
this story with me.

1503
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:14,429
I just don't think I'm built like that.

1504
01:22:15,388 --> 01:22:16,388
Hmm.

1505
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:20,101
This is your life.

1506
01:22:20,644 --> 01:22:24,689
This big, bruised, bloody,
beautiful thing.

1507
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,734
This is your life.
I'm not going to tell you what to do.

1508
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:28,859
Since when?

1509
01:22:29,736 --> 01:22:30,737
Since today.

1510
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:32,781
- Okay.
- Daniel, hey.

1511
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:37,202
You have been under the water
for a long time.

1512
01:22:39,162 --> 01:22:40,455
But when you come up,

1513
01:22:41,831 --> 01:22:44,250
you need to decide what life you want.

1514
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:49,546
You got this.

1515
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:51,966
I love you.

1516
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:55,219
Ma?

1517
01:22:56,554 --> 01:22:58,515
I think I'm locked out of my apartment.

1518
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,320
Use the window.
That's what I do.

1519
01:23:01,017 --> 01:23:02,017
I'm out!

1520
01:24:21,931 --> 01:24:22,766
Hi.

1521
01:24:22,849 --> 01:24:24,392
You're back.

1522
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:30,023
Oh, what's the matter, sweetheart?

1523
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,150
You and Paul have a fight?

1524
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:34,069
Oh, several.

1525
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:36,946
And Gillian. And Carol.

1526
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:39,491
We didn't even drive back together.

1527
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:42,077
Everyone is...

1528
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:45,663
sick of me. And so am I.

1529
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:50,835
Frank, why did you marry me?

1530
01:24:52,212 --> 01:24:55,673
Well, I think what everybody wonders
is why you married me.

1531
01:24:56,132 --> 01:24:57,383
No, really.

1532
01:24:58,426 --> 01:24:59,426
Why?

1533
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:01,763
You're kind.

1534
01:25:02,722 --> 01:25:04,933
And you're smart, you're funny as hell.

1535
01:25:05,683 --> 01:25:07,268
You have a lot of love to give.

1536
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:10,146
- I do, right?
- Yes.

1537
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:13,858
And you’re opinionated and passionate.

1538
01:25:14,692 --> 01:25:18,363
And sometimes you have sharp edges
and I like that.

1539
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:20,365
You tell it like it is.

1540
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:23,033
My...

1541
01:25:23,535 --> 01:25:24,535
looks?

1542
01:25:24,869 --> 01:25:27,413
Oh, you think I married you
for your personality?

1543
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:31,417
You come in a very...

1544
01:25:31,918 --> 01:25:33,545
beautiful package.

1545
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:37,757
But that’s not all
there is to Helen Halston.

1546
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:42,971
- I am so lucky.
- Oh.

1547
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:45,390
I'm so...

1548
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:50,603
Oh... Oh, really?

1549
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:52,480
Yes. We're doing it.

1550
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:03,825
Thanks for coming.

1551
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:05,952
Your texts wore me down.

1552
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:09,205
Did you bring a pen?

1553
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:20,192
Hey, Mrs. Walker.

1554
01:26:20,216 --> 01:26:21,216
More flowers.

1555
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:24,387
Oh, it must be some mistake.
I didn't order any flowers.

1556
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:26,514
Oh, uh, there's a note with them.

1557
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:31,477
<i>Her favorite flower is an iris.</i>

1558
01:26:31,769 --> 01:26:33,021
Well, thank you, Shawn.

1559
01:26:33,229 --> 01:26:35,106
And I know that because she told me.

1560
01:26:35,481 --> 01:26:37,601
When she asked me for the ten things
I know about her.

1561
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:39,235
Then, you can't use it.

1562
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:41,237
What? Yes, I can. It's a freebie.

1563
01:26:41,446 --> 01:26:43,781
If you can't think of ten things
you know about your mother

1564
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:46,618
without one of them being something
that she flat-out told you,

1565
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:49,245
- then you're a shitty son.
- I'm not a shitty son.

1566
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:52,165
Then think about
why you love her and write it down.

1567
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:57,795
<i>I know she loved my father.
And he wasn't that lovable.</i>

1568
01:26:58,463 --> 01:27:00,006
<i>He was always working.</i>

1569
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:03,176
<i>Even when we played, it was work.</i>

1570
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:06,799
And my mom was the one who taught me
how to have fun.

1571
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:10,141
When I was a kid,
she used to...

1572
01:27:10,266 --> 01:27:12,685
read me these bedtime stories and...

1573
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:15,521
she'd pretend there was one more page.

1574
01:27:18,107 --> 01:27:20,985
And we'd make up a new ending.

1575
01:27:26,032 --> 01:27:27,867
- Write that down.
- Oh? Yeah.

1576
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:31,162
<i>Well, she did a lot of art
when I was a kid.</i>

1577
01:27:31,788 --> 01:27:33,414
<i>Pen and ink note cards,</i>

1578
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:35,541
oil paintings from photographs.

1579
01:27:36,626 --> 01:27:38,461
This one time she did this...

1580
01:27:40,296 --> 01:27:41,673
great mural on my wall.

1581
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:48,221
<i>One: You loved my father.</i>

1582
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:53,977
<i>Two: You taught me how to have fun.</i>

1583
01:27:56,479 --> 01:27:59,232
<i>Three: You could have been an artist.</i>

1584
01:28:00,191 --> 01:28:03,069
Number four,
she thinks you're a good person.

1585
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:06,447
- No, she doesn't.
- She told me.

1586
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:09,617
She told you that she thinks
that I'm good?

1587
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:13,750
You can write she's the only person
in the world who thinks you're good.

1588
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:17,625
I never knew that she thought that.

1589
01:28:18,584 --> 01:28:22,672
<i>Four: You're the only person in the world
who thinks I'm good.</i>

1590
01:28:24,007 --> 01:28:27,969
<i>Five: You made me feel loved and safe.</i>

1591
01:28:28,845 --> 01:28:33,558
<i>Six: You cut up fruit for my snacks
even when I begged for junk food.</i>

1592
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:39,063
<i>Seven: You still call me,
even when I ignore you.</i>

1593
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:41,274
<i>Thank you.</i>

1594
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:43,484
<i>Eight:</i>

1595
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:46,279
<i>The only times
I've ever seen you angry</i>

1596
01:28:46,404 --> 01:28:49,324
<i>are times you deserved to be angrier.</i>

1597
01:28:50,908 --> 01:28:51,908
<i>Nine:</i>

1598
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:54,037
<i>You love to dance.</i>

1599
01:28:54,495 --> 01:28:56,456
<i>Ten:</i>

1600
01:28:57,457 --> 01:28:58,541
<i>You're my mother.</i>

1601
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,001
<i>Eleven:</i>

1602
01:29:01,878 --> 01:29:04,922
<i>You taught me there is room
in every story...</i>

1603
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:06,883
<i>for a better ending.</i>

1604
01:29:23,941 --> 01:29:24,941
Erin!

1605
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:28,696
Erin!

1606
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:31,156
Erin!

1607
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:34,326
Erin!

1608
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:37,204
Erin!

1609
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:40,874
Erin!

1610
01:29:45,421 --> 01:29:46,756
Erin! Wait up!

1611
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:52,387
I really... I need to...

1612
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:55,765
- get to the gym more often.
- What are you doing?

1613
01:29:55,848 --> 01:29:58,434
- What are you doing?
- I’m moving to LA.

1614
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:00,353
Well...

1615
01:30:01,312 --> 01:30:03,564
- can I talk to you first?
- About what?

1616
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:04,607
About us.

1617
01:30:04,732 --> 01:30:08,361
Oh, my... It's too late,
Daniel. My whole life is in this truck.

1618
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:11,739
That’s funny.
I was just thinking the same thing.

1619
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:15,159
You’re not going to stop me.

1620
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:17,744
Okay.

1621
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:19,288
Okay.

1622
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:23,084
Can we talk on the way?

1623
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:25,420
- You don't have anything to do?
- Please.

1624
01:30:25,503 --> 01:30:28,256
- You're gonna drive me to LA?
- I'm coming to LA.

1625
01:30:28,339 --> 01:30:30,383
I'm coming with you.

1626
01:30:30,466 --> 01:30:32,135
Coming to LA...

1627
01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:34,095
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry!

1628
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:36,222
I'm sorry.

1629
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:38,641
I'm sorry, too.

1630
01:30:41,018 --> 01:30:42,778
Do you know how to drive
one of these?

1631
01:30:42,854 --> 01:30:44,355
I don't know what I'm doing.

1632
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:03,458
Hey, where you going?

1633
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:06,878
I swear she looks like both of you.

1634
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:08,856
To be honest,
we think she looks like your mother.

1635
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,466
Uh, acts like it.

1636
01:31:11,549 --> 01:31:13,926
- Oh, my goodness!
- Speak of the devil.

1637
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:16,012
- Or angel, depending who you ask.
- Who's that?

1638
01:31:16,095 --> 01:31:18,931
Oh, grandma loves Ella!

1639
01:31:19,015 --> 01:31:21,267
- Look who it is!
- Grandma!

1640
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:23,060
And you.

1641
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:25,104
- And you. And you,
- Hi.

1642
01:31:25,521 --> 01:31:27,148
And you!

1643
01:31:28,357 --> 01:31:31,694
Well, this is kind of
a complicated garment, isn't it?

1644
01:31:31,777 --> 01:31:33,797
My mother's at her son's
semi Jewish wedding

1645
01:31:33,821 --> 01:31:35,740
- and she's still complaining.
- Okay.

1646
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:37,843
You're not supposed to see the bride
before the wedding.

1647
01:31:37,867 --> 01:31:41,162
I know, but we broke a few rules
already. I think we can break one more.

1648
01:31:41,704 --> 01:31:43,873
Well, he's got a point. We can.

1649
01:31:47,793 --> 01:31:49,086
Ahh!

1650
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:54,091
Thanks, Ma.

1651
01:31:55,301 --> 01:31:56,301
For everything.

1652
01:32:04,101 --> 01:32:05,311
No one's going to notice.

1653
01:32:07,313 --> 01:32:09,273
There's just one little thing, though.

1654
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:11,901
Uh... it's too late for a thing.

1655
01:32:12,109 --> 01:32:15,196
I know. I know,
but this is a really important thing.

1656
01:32:16,072 --> 01:32:17,865
I think we should rehearse the kiss again.

1657
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:35,883
I'm still so angry I can barely stand
to look at you.

1658
01:32:36,467 --> 01:32:38,344
I know. Thank you for the invitation.

1659
01:32:38,427 --> 01:32:40,638
I invited Frank. You’re his plus one.

1660
01:32:41,138 --> 01:32:43,116
- Did you get my messages?
- Yeah, about 20 of them.

1661
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:46,602
- Did you get my texts?
- Uh-huh. "Stop calling me."

1662
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:48,520
You know...

1663
01:32:49,146 --> 01:32:52,483
I am kind of responsible
for this whole wedding,

1664
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:54,735
I mean, if we hadn’t gone to New York...

1665
01:32:55,778 --> 01:32:58,030
So, now, we’re considering
that trip a success?

1666
01:32:58,114 --> 01:33:00,199
Well, look at where we are.

1667
01:33:00,283 --> 01:33:02,368
And Carol's in Italy.

1668
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:04,579
She didn’t even RSVP.

1669
01:33:04,704 --> 01:33:07,665
She’s probably too busy
painting, eating pizza,

1670
01:33:07,748 --> 01:33:10,251
- taking Italian lovers.
- Oh!

1671
01:33:10,334 --> 01:33:13,296
I’m sure she’s miserable
since she sold that house.

1672
01:33:13,379 --> 01:33:14,380
Hmm.

1673
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:20,177
Don’t start the wedding without us!

1674
01:33:21,721 --> 01:33:25,683
I knew she would come! I missed her
so much more than I missed you.

1675
01:33:25,766 --> 01:33:27,101
Same here. Only double.

1676
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:29,312
Oh, it’s just his date.

1677
01:33:30,062 --> 01:33:32,940
She’s too old to be his date.
She’s, like, his age.

1678
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:39,196
Oh, my God!

1679
01:33:39,655 --> 01:33:42,366
Oh, my God!

1680
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:44,034
Yes!

1681
01:33:45,745 --> 01:33:46,912
Oh!

1682
01:33:48,664 --> 01:33:50,416
I heard there was cake.

1683
01:33:50,499 --> 01:33:52,209
You don’t call, you don’t write.

1684
01:33:52,376 --> 01:33:54,962
- Oh, we missed you so much!
- Oh...

1685
01:33:55,254 --> 01:33:57,423
You look so glamorous.

1686
01:33:59,675 --> 01:34:02,345
<i>By the way, I brought Bourbon.</i>

1687
01:34:02,428 --> 01:34:04,388
- <i>Oh.
- Oh, no!</i>

1688
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:07,183
<i>- Not again.
- Of course she did.</i>

Twelve-thirty it is.

I'll see you then.

- Here he is. And...?
CASEY: What happened?

158
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:37,125
- She wants to have lunch.
SAM: Okay.

159
00:10:37,292 --> 00:10:39,500
- Just the two of us.
SAM: All right. Fantastic.

See? There's progress. That's great.

Seriously, Bry,
you should think about coming with us.

You've got the edge.
There's more of this to be had.

178

- She's going to college next year?
- Yep.

00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,542
- You're gonna lose her.
- That gives me a year to find her.

00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,125
Mr. Mills, she'd like to see you.

- How are you feeling?
- Better.

182

So your daughter
wants to be a singer?

183
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:25,083
Yep, since she was 5.

It's not what everyone thinks it is.

185

Once the glam wears off, it's just
a lot of hotel rooms, lots of airports.

It's what she wants.

The first number is Gio,
my vocal coach.

188

If he says she can sing, she can sing.

He'll give her coaching she needs,
the fee is on me.

190
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,333
The second number is my manager.

191

If Gio clears her,
he'll make sure she gets a shot.

- No, Mr. Mills, thank you.

- You know my friend Amanda?
- Yep.

with them in Paris.

How cool is that?

207
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:53,083
- Why do you want to go to Paris?
- Dad. Hello?

208
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,542
The Louvre, the Impressionist museum,
the Picasso Museum.

209
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,583
I didn't know you were so into art.

210
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,792
Are you kidding? I've been to the MOMA,
like, a hundred times.

211
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:06,708
Amanda went last summer, she came
back, she could practically speak French.

212
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,583
And because you're under 18...

213
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,583
...you need my permission
to leave the country?

214
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:17,583
Dad, please. I really, really wanna go.

00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,583
They've got this
sick apartment overlooking the river.

00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,208
- Just you and Amanda?
- And her cousins.

- Dad.
- I know the world, sweetie.

220
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,333
- Dad, please.
- A 17-year-old should not travel alone.

221
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,708
- I'm not gonna be alone.
- Two 17-year-olds.

222
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,875
Amanda's 19.

223
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,000
How about this?
How about if I go along?

224
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:55,000
You won't know I'm there.
I'm very good at being invisible.

225
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:58,458
As you so amply demonstrated
for most of her life.

226
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,208
Just sign the paper, Bryan.

227
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,625
I'll think about it.

228
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:07,000
Everyone at this table
knows what that means.

229
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,417
Hey, Kimmy, there's something else.

230
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,708
- I don't want anything else.
- Kim.

231
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,625
- I don't get you.
- What?

232
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:25,125
You sacrificed our marriage
in the service of the country.

233
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:28,042
You made a mess of your life
in service of your country.

234
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,042
Can't you sacrifice a little
this time for your daughter?

235
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,083
- I would sacrifice anything for her.
- What's your problem?

236
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,542
I'm not comfortable
putting my daughter at risk.

237
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:41,708
Putting our daughter at risk
by going to Paris?

238
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:44,167
You're pathetic.

239
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,333
- She's coming.
- Thanks.

240
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:06,625
Three conditions.

241
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,625
The address and phone number
of where you're staying.

242
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:12,750
You move, I wanna know where
and with whom you'll be staying.

243
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:16,500
Call me when you land. Call me
every night before you go to sleep.

244
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:18,417
It's international. My number is in.

245
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,708
- Okay, awesome.
- Kimmy, you're not focused.

246
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,167
- I am.
- What did I say?

247
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,667
You said call you when I land,
every night before I go to sleep...

248
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,667
...your phone's international,
the number's programmed in.

249
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:32,000
Okay, one last thing.
I get to take you to the airport.

250
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:33,667
Okay.

251
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,417
- There you go.
- Yes.

252
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,917
Thank you, Daddy.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

253
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,792
Mom!

254
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:44,875
I love you, Dad.

255
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:49,083
Mom, he signed it, he signed it.
I'm gonna go call Amanda!

256
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,583
Wouldn't it have been easier
to sign the first time?

257
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,375
Wouldn't it have been easier
if you and I had talked about it first?

258
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,542
Certain areas in Paris you should avoid.
I've written them down.

259
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:07,958
- Dad.
- Come on, take it.

260
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:11,917
We're gonna be spending 90 percent
of our time in museums. Don't worry.

261
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,792
That's like telling water
not to be wet, sweetie.

262
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,000
Mom says
your job made you paranoid.

263
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,875
Well, my job made me aware.

264
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:24,083
I used to ask Mom what your job was
that you were away all the time.

265
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,583
And she would tell me to ask you.

266
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,375
Whenever I did see you,
I was afraid to ask.

267
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:32,292
Yeah? Why?

268
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:35,958
I don't know. Maybe because...

269
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:38,792
...I was afraid to find out.

270
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,792
Like, maybe it was something
I wouldn't like.

271
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:46,292
I worked for the government.
You knew that.

272
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:51,042
So you were like a spy, right?

273
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:54,667
- What happens if I push this button?
- Don't touch that button.

274
00:17:55,375 --> 00:18:00,708
Well, no, I was a...
I was a preventer, actually.

275
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,708
- A preventer?
- Yeah.

276
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,042
What did you prevent?

277
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,208
Bad things from happening.

278
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:11,792
So it was a good job?

279
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,750
Yes. Yep, it was.

280
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,708
Do you miss it?

281
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:20,542
I missed you more.

282
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,917
- Kim!
- Dad, there's Amanda.

283
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,917
Go ahead. I'll get the bags.

284
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:04,333
- Jimmy'll give you a hand with those.
- I can manage.

285
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,917
Lenore.

286
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,917
Do you know about this?
She's not just going to Paris.

287
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,250
- I know.
- She lied to me.

288
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,583
Yes, because she can't be honest
with you.

289
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,833
Why? What are you talking about?

290
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,667
Your rules and conditions.

291
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,125
What is this?

292
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:22,042
It's U2's European tour dates.

293
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,208
She's following a rock band
around Europe?

294
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:28,083
All kids do. Stuart got her tickets,
arranged her to stay in the best hotels.

295
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,417
Best hotels. You know,
you live in your little bubble here...

296
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,958
...behind your wall, with your maids
and chauffeurs and servants.

297
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,625
No idea what the world is like.

298
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:40,583
Yes, and neither will she
unless she goes out and experiences it.

299
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,708
Don't tell me I don't know the world.

300
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:48,833
For five years I waited for a phone call
that didn't come for weeks at a time.

301
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,042
For a knock on the door
telling me there'd be no calls anymore.

302
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,250
Listen, I know you moved here to build
some sort of relationship with Kimmy.

303
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:03,250
But you're not gonna do that
by smothering her.

304
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:06,958
Let her live, or I promise,
I promise you'll lose her.

305
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,000
Girls.

306
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:21,792
Kim!

307
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,792

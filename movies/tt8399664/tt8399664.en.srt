00:01:07,494 --> 00:01:11,264
<i>Smoking is not allowed at this
station, or on the train.</i>

4
00:01:11,298 --> 00:01:13,333
Like everyone's wearing
strapless to the formal now

5
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:15,200
so...

6
00:01:15,235 --> 00:01:17,803
Yeah, that's good,
'cause it's a bit, like

7
00:01:17,836 --> 00:01:20,172
I don't know,
that would suit you.

8
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,409
<i>I reckon I'm going to say
something to Mrs. Martin.</i>

9
00:01:22,442 --> 00:01:24,344
<i>Seriously, she need to get her
scales right</i>

10
00:01:24,377 --> 00:01:25,378
<i>and everything, like...</i>

11
00:01:25,412 --> 00:01:28,281
<i>No! You can't!</i>

12
00:01:44,163 --> 00:01:45,998
<i>Dickhead!</i>

13
00:01:48,268 --> 00:01:50,069
<i>Milla!</i>

14
00:01:50,102 --> 00:01:52,971
- <i>Doors closing, stand clear.</i>
- Milla!

15
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:13,827
Damn!

16
00:02:15,829 --> 00:02:17,996
Your hair's like, uh...

17
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,898
What?

18
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:23,603
Your hair's like bangles
or something.

19
00:02:23,636 --> 00:02:25,904
Bangles?

20
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:29,309
Like with the light,
it's like bangles, it's...

21
00:02:30,677 --> 00:02:32,245
Damn.

22
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:38,451
Yours is nice too.

23
00:02:38,485 --> 00:02:40,687
Yeah, but look at this.

24
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,389
Look at that, see.

25
00:02:42,422 --> 00:02:45,458
I cut myself. See?

26
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:47,827
I had to get on like a weird
angle to get to that bit.

27
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:50,230
- And then I...
- Can I feel?

28
00:02:50,263 --> 00:02:51,831
Yeah.

29
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,403
- Feels like snakeskin.
- Ooh! Yeah.

30
00:02:59,672 --> 00:03:02,207
Oh, shit, there's blood...

31
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:04,910
Oh!

32
00:03:04,943 --> 00:03:06,546
- It's so stupid.
- It's okay.

33
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:08,046
I'm just gonna wait over there.

34
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,015
Shit, it's gone on your...

35
00:03:10,048 --> 00:03:11,518
- Oh no, it's fine. Seriously.
- It's gone on your shirt. Here.

36
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:13,586
- Happens all the time.
- Just lay down for a minute.

37
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,187
I got you.

38
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:20,427
<i>Passengers on platform four,
the next train...</i>

39
00:03:22,027 --> 00:03:25,197
You just find
a little bit of sky.

40
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:34,641
Sorry, could you just
take it off my face.

41
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:36,476
It smells.

42
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,856
- Is there blood in my hair?
- Nah.

43
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:56,796
- Oh, there is a lot of blood.
- Get up.

44
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:03,436
Hey, um,
I hate to ask you this

45
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,539
um, I've just been kicked out
of my house and...

46
00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:08,241
- Evicted?
- Yeah, evicted.

47
00:04:08,274 --> 00:04:09,876
And, uh, I just,
I'm sort of trying

48
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:10,910
to put some money together
to get a bed

49
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:11,945
in a shelter for the night...

50
00:04:11,977 --> 00:04:13,580
Why did you get evicted?

51
00:04:13,613 --> 00:04:15,648
Just because I got behind
in my rent. I hate to ask you.

52
00:04:15,682 --> 00:04:16,716
You just seem like a really nice
person.

53
00:04:16,749 --> 00:04:17,884
How much?

54
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:19,552
Uh, just whatever
you can manage.

55
00:04:19,586 --> 00:04:21,019
It doesn't have to be much.

56
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,555
Just 'cause I saved your life
or whatever.

57
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:25,325
- I've only got 50.
- Fifty! That's too much!

58
00:04:25,358 --> 00:04:27,059
- I can't...
- I can split it.

59
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:29,829
Uh, no, no, no.
Fifty's okay.

60
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:40,874
Hey, you want to take this one?

61
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:43,910
If I give you 50,
you have to do something for me.

62
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:52,719
You know she's playing easy
listening in the reception?

63
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:55,120
No wonder your patients
are so tense.

64
00:04:58,156 --> 00:05:00,627
- <i>Is my time up?</i>
- Not quite.

65
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,362
<i>I'm just boring you.</i>

66
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:07,065
- It's quarter past.
- Yeah, alright.

67
00:05:12,505 --> 00:05:16,009
- Really?
- When's your next client?

68
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,913
4:30.
It's just she tends to be early.

69
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:23,215
Oh, let's just do it.
Don't you think?

70
00:05:23,249 --> 00:05:26,519
It's the last thing we're going
to feel like doing next Tuesday.

71
00:05:26,553 --> 00:05:28,388
Hm!

72
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:29,956
Hm!

73
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:33,259
While I remember...

74
00:05:36,896 --> 00:05:38,831
Take one of these with food.

75
00:05:38,865 --> 00:05:41,568
These are the same things that
are in the blue bottle, yeah?

76
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:45,038
And, darling, start taking an
Ativan in the morning as well.

77
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,072
Just for the next few weeks,
alright?

78
00:05:47,105 --> 00:05:49,709
- I love this bra.
- Hm.

79
00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:52,045
Couch or desk? Hm?

80
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:04,324
Oh.

81
00:06:04,357 --> 00:06:06,292
She looks like a little kid
here.

82
00:06:06,326 --> 00:06:08,027
Do you know
that was five years ago.

83
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:10,029
I don't remember
this being taken.

84
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:12,432
She looks so pissed off.

85
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:14,901
- She does not look pissed off.
- She does.

86
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:19,405
That is, no, she does not.
It's the sun across her face.

87
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,842
That is practically a National
Geographic standard photograph.

88
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:23,876
How are you doing
with that sandwich?

89
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,512
Many of my patients have said

90
00:06:26,546 --> 00:06:29,248
that it looks like
a professional photographer.

91
00:06:29,282 --> 00:06:32,452
Yeah, but they are crazy, Henry.

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,167
She's gonna be okay.

93
00:06:57,243 --> 00:07:00,113
- Can you just move your leg.
- Yeah.

94
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:02,548
- Does that hurt?
- No, babe.

95
00:07:17,597 --> 00:07:19,499
I've got to answer that.

96
00:07:19,532 --> 00:07:21,968
- I have to answer that.
- Uh-unh!

97
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,515
Really?

98
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:42,121
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:42,155 --> 00:07:43,890
Uh, can you just get her last

100
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:46,159
MRI scan ready for me please?

101
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:48,661
No, there's a more recent one.

102
00:07:48,695 --> 00:07:50,897
There's a more recent one
than that.

103
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,699
But that's... that's the one.

104
00:07:58,638 --> 00:08:00,039
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hm.

105
00:08:00,073 --> 00:08:02,875
- You gonna pick her up now?
- Yeah. I'll see you tonight.

106
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:06,211
Oh, fuck. I love you

107
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:46,285
Fuck!

108
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:48,020
- We've got to go.
- Why?

109
00:08:48,054 --> 00:08:49,655
Wait!

110
00:08:49,689 --> 00:08:52,226
My violin! My violin.

111
00:08:52,258 --> 00:08:54,861
Duncan Abrahams is big
but he doesn't throw himself in.

112
00:08:54,894 --> 00:08:57,296
Oh, I know. Hello! Hello!

113
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,998
<i>Oh, I know,
I'm sorry we left you...</i>

114
00:08:59,031 --> 00:09:01,467
He's got reach,
but he can hardly...

115
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:06,506
<i>Come here, Zach.</i>

116
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:08,007
Mum.

117
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:11,577
<i>Hey, Zachy.</i>

118
00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:19,253
Uh, I'd like to report
a break-in.

119
00:09:19,285 --> 00:09:21,554
Fuck you, mum!

120
00:09:41,741 --> 00:09:43,676
You've got...

121
00:09:45,077 --> 00:09:47,079
...little trimmings
on your face.

122
00:09:47,113 --> 00:09:48,648
They're like, so pretty.

123
00:09:48,681 --> 00:09:51,818
- Like little gold...
- Just have your water, mum.

124
00:09:53,753 --> 00:09:55,888
What's it called?

125
00:09:55,922 --> 00:10:00,026
Is this a... style?

126
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:01,494
I was going for rat's tails.

127
00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:03,930
You're a hairdresser,
are you, Moses?

128
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:06,233
Mum trains Bichons.

129
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:08,501
And that's how you know
about rats, is it?

130
00:10:08,534 --> 00:10:10,304
That's why I've got access
to clippers.

131
00:10:10,336 --> 00:10:12,004
They're poodle clippers,
but I use them on me as well.

132
00:10:12,038 --> 00:10:13,372
<i>I mean, you get a result
you're happy with</i>

133
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:14,774
<i>using poodle clippers?</i>

134
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:16,676
They're just like regular
clippers, mum.

135
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:17,577
Bit louder maybe.

136
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,145
They're probably a little bit

137
00:10:19,178 --> 00:10:20,546
less accurate, I imagine.

138
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,648
<i>No. No.
We were competitive.</i>

139
00:10:22,682 --> 00:10:26,586
Mum's a three time state award
winner with her bichons.

140
00:10:26,619 --> 00:10:28,087
Oh, wow.

141
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,422
How old are you, Moses?

142
00:10:29,455 --> 00:10:30,857
- I'm twenty...
- Sixteen.

143
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,091
- ...three.
- Twenty.

144
00:10:32,124 --> 00:10:34,827
I'm twenty three.

145
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:37,129
Well...

146
00:10:37,163 --> 00:10:38,931
I'm a bit freaked out by that.

147
00:10:38,965 --> 00:10:40,867
But, um, lucky for everyone

148
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,135
I forgot I'd taken a Zoloft
when I took two Xanax

149
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:45,239
while I was waiting for you
at the hairdresser to show up

150
00:10:45,272 --> 00:10:46,505
thinking you must've been
abducted

151
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:48,541
because why else
would you not even come?

152
00:10:48,574 --> 00:10:50,710
We know that she's okay now.
Don't we?

153
00:10:50,743 --> 00:10:55,081
- God, two of those blues.
- Right?

154
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:57,149
Those ones you gave me.

155
00:10:57,183 --> 00:11:01,255
Though I'm feeling
very relaxed right now.

156
00:11:02,322 --> 00:11:05,558
Feels like we...
I'm havin' a stroke.

157
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,896
I can't feel this.

158
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,088
You look like a different
person.

159
00:11:36,122 --> 00:11:38,292
Good.

160
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:41,228
What have you done
with my daughter?

161
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:42,595
I killed her.

162
00:11:44,364 --> 00:11:46,366
Oh, my God.

163
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,469
She's got a great shaped head
for it.

164
00:11:50,503 --> 00:11:53,739
<i>We were nervous.
I mean, well, I was.</i>

165
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:57,543
I was nervous,
because she was very overdue

166
00:11:57,576 --> 00:12:01,847
and had to be, have those, um...

167
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:04,150
What's that word?

168
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:07,053
Um... What do you call 'em?

169
00:12:07,086 --> 00:12:09,389
What's... what's that word?

170
00:12:10,656 --> 00:12:12,959
The... Henry, what is the,
what is that word?

171
00:12:12,992 --> 00:12:15,161
- The...
- Vase.

172
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,896
- Vase?
- Forceps.

173
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:20,833
She had to be induced but then
they used the forceps.

174
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:23,135
And she started pulling them
right up inside me

175
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:24,603
because she did not
wanna come out.

176
00:12:24,637 --> 00:12:26,105
And I was ripped to shreds.

177
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:28,708
- <i>But we got in here, and we...</i>
- Oh, my God!

178
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:32,279
Anna. Anna, let's go for a walk
around the block.

179
00:12:32,312 --> 00:12:36,749
Sorry, Milla.
I am so high, right now.

180
00:12:38,452 --> 00:12:40,820
You've got blood in your mouth.

181
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:43,689
- What?
- Your mouth is bleeding.

182
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:48,228
Oh, fuck.

183
00:12:48,261 --> 00:12:49,729
I've had this loose tooth.

184
00:12:49,762 --> 00:12:53,766
Not a baby tooth though,
only Milla has baby teeth.

185
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:57,737
And it's an aberration
for someone as old as me.

186
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,307
Which one is it?

187
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,142
This one. At the back.

188
00:13:03,175 --> 00:13:05,077
- Show me.
- There.

189
00:13:05,111 --> 00:13:07,280
Oh! Hi there, little guy!

190
00:13:07,314 --> 00:13:10,317
- Get away from her!
- Mum!

191
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,521
Ahem. Sorry, Moses.

192
00:13:15,554 --> 00:13:17,790
Don't apologies to him
for me.

193
00:13:17,823 --> 00:13:20,559
- Why is he even here?
- He's my guest!

194
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:22,496
N... no.
No smoking.

195
00:13:22,528 --> 00:13:23,996
- Not in front of Milla!
- I'm sorry.

196
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,132
- Outside! You take can it outside!
- Mum! Mum...

197
00:13:26,165 --> 00:13:29,503
Mum, he... You don't,
you don't have to go outside.

198
00:13:29,535 --> 00:13:31,505
Do you have that, um...

199
00:13:33,273 --> 00:13:35,242
Oh, yeah.

200
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:37,910
Um... Yeah. Here.

201
00:13:42,715 --> 00:13:44,183
Here.

202
00:13:44,216 --> 00:13:45,718
Thanks for dinner.

203
00:13:47,521 --> 00:13:50,656
- I'll see you round.
- Where?

204
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:53,659
- <i>Around.</i>
- You don't have to go.

205
00:14:14,247 --> 00:14:17,783
Henry! Henry!

206
00:14:17,817 --> 00:14:19,819
Fucking hell.

207
00:14:27,126 --> 00:14:29,329
It's a bit flat sweetheart.

208
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:47,613
- It's still a bit flat.
- <i>Henry!</i>

209
00:14:47,646 --> 00:14:49,748
<i>You fucking mongrel.</i>

210
00:14:51,451 --> 00:14:53,986
<i>Henry!</i>

211
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,721
<i>Who is she?</i>

212
00:14:55,754 --> 00:14:57,957
<i>We're gonna have to move.</i>

213
00:14:59,725 --> 00:15:02,229
<i>Henry!</i>

214
00:15:02,262 --> 00:15:05,831
We're lucky Gidon
can fit us in this morning.

215
00:15:05,865 --> 00:15:08,868
Maybe he can give you some
theory you can carry on with.

216
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:12,339
Tell Ann that we're still aiming
to do the exam in March.

217
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,041
Milla!

218
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,312
What's wrong with you?

219
00:15:19,346 --> 00:15:21,481
What do you think's
wrong with me?

220
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:26,152
You can't treat things
like this.

221
00:15:26,185 --> 00:15:29,456
What about you?
You were disgusting yesterday!

222
00:15:30,624 --> 00:15:33,826
Mill!
That boy had problems!

223
00:15:33,859 --> 00:15:35,728
So do I!

224
00:16:02,355 --> 00:16:03,789
<i>Bye, darling.</i>

225
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,176
- Hey.
- Hello.

226
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,346
Oh, shit! Shit, shit. Fuck.

227
00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:30,082
Fuck! Bit of ash.

228
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:32,652
You shouldn't smoke,
yo... you know that.

229
00:16:32,686 --> 00:16:34,521
- Yeah. I need both hands.
- No.

230
00:16:34,554 --> 00:16:38,157
Because, you know,
you're pregnant, so...

231
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,460
No, they did a study about that,
actually it's totally fine

232
00:16:40,493 --> 00:16:41,994
as long as you don't smoke
tailor-mades

233
00:16:42,027 --> 00:16:43,330
in the first trimester.

234
00:16:43,363 --> 00:16:44,930
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

235
00:16:44,964 --> 00:16:47,132
- I read it online.
- No, that's bullshit.

236
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,569
There's no such thing
as a safe cigarette.

237
00:16:50,704 --> 00:16:53,373
It's not bullshit,
I read it online.

238
00:16:53,406 --> 00:16:55,107
Thanks.

239
00:16:56,108 --> 00:16:57,711
See you round.

240
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:07,820
Henry!

241
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:12,592
- I've lost my dog.
- Hm.

242
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:13,826
<i>Probably just out, you know</i>

243
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,395
checking out
his new neighborhood.

244
00:17:15,428 --> 00:17:19,232
<i>Yeah. Hopefully not stuck
to someone's bumper.</i>

245
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:23,836
<i>Henry!</i>

246
00:17:25,204 --> 00:17:26,539
<i>Henry!</i>

247
00:17:27,474 --> 00:17:29,709
- I'm Toby.
- And I'm Henry.

248
00:17:29,743 --> 00:17:32,111
I... that's my name, Henry.

249
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:37,717
- No, you're not.
- Yeah. Henry James Finlay.

250
00:17:40,886 --> 00:17:43,188
But Henry's a dog's name.

251
00:17:44,324 --> 00:17:47,059
Why didn't you say something?

252
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,700
- Bye, Toby.
- Bye, Henry.

253
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,885
<i>Go to hell.</i>

254
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:22,928
Truly, I never hear
anything like, huh.

255
00:18:22,961 --> 00:18:25,964
Everything you touch
you destroy.

256
00:18:25,998 --> 00:18:27,634
Hm!

257
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:36,776
Oh! Here we go.

258
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:46,252
<i>Who did this to you? Huh?</i>

259
00:18:48,854 --> 00:18:51,324
<i>My boyfriend.</i>

260
00:18:51,358 --> 00:18:54,794
<i>Ah! You have boyfriend now?</i>

261
00:18:56,962 --> 00:19:00,500
<i>What kind of boyfriend
give you mange?</i>

262
00:19:00,533 --> 00:19:02,968
Well...

263
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:05,170
...he's actually a wild dog.

264
00:19:05,204 --> 00:19:09,975
You know, with this new look,
you need something...

265
00:19:10,008 --> 00:19:13,813
...you need something like...

266
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:16,349
...something like this.

267
00:19:16,383 --> 00:19:19,786
Eh?
Hm, hm, hm!

268
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:21,954
Try, try, try. Yeah.

269
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,726
Hey. Where your brother is?

270
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,128
Hey, why are you not at school?

271
00:19:30,463 --> 00:19:32,298
You want to wait in here?

272
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,602
<i>Inside?</i>

273
00:19:35,635 --> 00:19:38,538
<i>Come on, come on, yeah.</i>

274
00:19:38,571 --> 00:19:39,739
<i>Yeah, come on, come on.</i>

275
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,316
Come on. We have biscuits!

276
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,085
We have coffee!

277
00:19:53,118 --> 00:19:55,020
Dancing girls!

278
00:19:56,523 --> 00:19:58,725
- What's your name?
- Tin Wah.

279
00:19:58,758 --> 00:20:00,660
Taking the day off school,
Tin Wah?

280
00:20:00,693 --> 00:20:03,463
- Missed the bus.
- Yeah, right.

281
00:20:08,268 --> 00:20:12,070
Ah, you know this?

282
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:15,241
Eh, here.

283
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:17,444
Put your chin here.

284
00:20:17,477 --> 00:20:19,279
Like that. Yes.

285
00:20:19,312 --> 00:20:22,315
Comfortable.

286
00:20:22,348 --> 00:20:23,917
<i>Comfortable.</i>

287
00:22:38,384 --> 00:22:39,919
Shh!

288
00:22:39,953 --> 00:22:42,422
Don't move.
Don't you fuckin' move.

289
00:22:42,455 --> 00:22:44,057
It's okay.

290
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:46,392
<i>Don't come any closer.
Shh! Don't move.</i>

291
00:22:46,426 --> 00:22:48,261
Don't fuckin' move.

292
00:22:57,202 --> 00:22:59,171
That'll just make you feel sick.

293
00:22:59,204 --> 00:23:01,441
That'll just make you sick.

294
00:23:08,948 --> 00:23:10,583
These ones have got
codeine in them

295
00:23:10,617 --> 00:23:13,319
<i>these ones will make you
feel calmer.</i>

296
00:23:13,353 --> 00:23:15,421
- <i>Mum!</i>
- Ah! Just get out.

297
00:23:15,455 --> 00:23:17,757
- I won't tell anyone. Go!
- <i>Mum!</i>

298
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:21,327
Coming sweetheart!
Go, go, go.

299
00:23:21,361 --> 00:23:23,161
- Milla! Henry! Henry!
- Shh!

300
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:24,330
Hey! Shut up. Shut up.

301
00:23:24,364 --> 00:23:27,367
- Just get out! Get out!
- Alright!

302
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,737
<i>Milla, don't come in here.
Go back to your room. Now!</i>

303
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,238
Moses?

304
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:38,578
- Oh, Milla.
- Are you ripping us off?

305
00:23:39,512 --> 00:23:41,146
Oh, this is so bad.

306
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:44,216
- Oh, God.
- He was in the kitchen.

307
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,818
- Have you called the police?
- No!

308
00:23:45,852 --> 00:23:48,254
When would I have had a chance
to call the police, Henry?

309
00:23:48,287 --> 00:23:50,188
If you call the police
we're totally entering

310
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:51,424
the cycle of abuse, Henry.

311
00:23:51,457 --> 00:23:53,459
That is 100% your fault.

312
00:23:53,493 --> 00:23:55,561
Please, dad. I won't be able
to respect you if you do.

313
00:23:55,595 --> 00:23:58,331
What's his... What's your
surname? I'll call his parents.

314
00:23:58,364 --> 00:24:00,165
- Please don't.
- He's been thrown out of home.

315
00:24:00,198 --> 00:24:02,568
- It's complicated.
- His mum's troubled.

316
00:24:02,602 --> 00:24:04,237
Then I have to call the police.

317
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,938
I just don't think
that's right for him.

318
00:24:05,972 --> 00:24:08,474
Milla, he threatened me
with a meat prong.

319
00:24:08,508 --> 00:24:10,143
You threatened my wife
with a meat prong?

320
00:24:10,175 --> 00:24:11,544
No, I wouldn't have
done anything.

321
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:14,480
Mum, I'll... I'll do anything.
I will.

322
00:24:14,514 --> 00:24:16,716
I'll... I'll... I'll practice
the violin

323
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:18,284
and I'll go to support.

324
00:24:18,317 --> 00:24:20,086
And the fucking formal, I'll go.

325
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:23,690
Can he just please stay?

326
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:26,325
Anna, we can't do this.

327
00:24:27,694 --> 00:24:30,029
He was remarkably inept, Henry.

328
00:24:30,063 --> 00:24:31,998
And he's probably harmless.

329
00:24:32,031 --> 00:24:33,166
He's a drug addict.

330
00:24:33,198 --> 00:24:34,667
Don't pigeonhole him like that.

331
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:37,637
<i>Hey, thanks for being
so kind to me.</i>

332
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:40,139
You're so kind to me.

333
00:24:40,173 --> 00:24:43,443
- I lost my hair.
- It looks cool.

334
00:24:43,476 --> 00:24:45,578
It's like way better
than the one that I gave you.

335
00:24:45,611 --> 00:24:48,748
Anna, if there's no consequences

336
00:24:48,781 --> 00:24:50,016
he's going to be
back here again...

337
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:51,484
- Anna? Anna!
- What?

338
00:24:51,517 --> 00:24:53,686
I just need you to listen to me
and think this through.

339
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,154
I didn't invite him here, Henry.

340
00:24:55,188 --> 00:24:56,589
The boy is desperate.

341
00:24:56,622 --> 00:24:58,024
<i>I was dreaming about you
actually</i>

342
00:24:58,057 --> 00:25:00,226
<i>when you came in.</i>

343
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:02,228
You were dreaming about me?

344
00:25:02,261 --> 00:25:03,996
Yeah.

345
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,165
N... not...

346
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:08,868
No, we weren't doing anything...

347
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:10,636
You were just...

348
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:14,107
<i>...you were just
sort of... there.</i>

349
00:25:20,113 --> 00:25:22,115
It's morning.

350
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,252
He could stay for breakfast.

351
00:26:01,387 --> 00:26:02,655
<i>Milla!</i>

352
00:26:02,688 --> 00:26:04,223
Breakfast.

353
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:07,727
He must have fallen off his bike
or something.

354
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,296
He's got this scar.

355
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:15,968
- Morning.
- Morning.

356
00:26:16,002 --> 00:26:17,603
Sit down.

357
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,310
- Sorry about last night.
- Do you have a girlfriend?

358
00:26:25,945 --> 00:26:28,347
Uh, I wouldn't call her
a girlfriend.

359
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:30,583
- How old is she?
- She's 26.

360
00:26:30,616 --> 00:26:32,652
Sounds very appropriate.

361
00:26:33,853 --> 00:26:36,422
- You're making crepes?
- Mm-hm.

362
00:26:36,455 --> 00:26:38,258
Well, well.

363
00:26:41,527 --> 00:26:44,897
So, Moses, what have you got
planned for the day?

364
00:26:44,931 --> 00:26:47,133
You, uh,
you working at the moment?

365
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:49,135
Not in any formal way.

366
00:26:49,168 --> 00:26:52,738
And, um, informally?
What do you do?

367
00:26:52,772 --> 00:26:54,607
All different things.

368
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,377
Oh. Mm-hm.

369
00:26:58,411 --> 00:27:01,180
You think there's something
that I should be doing?

370
00:27:02,715 --> 00:27:04,150
No.

371
00:27:05,484 --> 00:27:08,688
I don't think the world would be
this big or weird

372
00:27:08,721 --> 00:27:10,324
if we were meant to choose
just one thing.

373
00:27:10,356 --> 00:27:13,260
I think as soon as people start

374
00:27:13,293 --> 00:27:15,494
doing that they become obsessed
with functionality

375
00:27:15,528 --> 00:27:17,063
instead of is it beautiful?

376
00:27:17,096 --> 00:27:20,267
Hm, it's true.
That is what happens.

377
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,134
I'm not ready to be functional.

378
00:27:22,168 --> 00:27:24,070
Of course that doesn't mean
you have to be dysfunctional.

379
00:27:24,103 --> 00:27:25,972
Henry!

380
00:27:26,005 --> 00:27:27,307
What is it you do, sir?

381
00:27:27,341 --> 00:27:29,442
He's a psychiatrist.

382
00:27:29,475 --> 00:27:32,879
I guess you think that you can
pin me like that.

383
00:27:34,647 --> 00:27:37,884
- Mill, you better get ready...
- Having my breakfast.

384
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:39,452
Sorry.

385
00:27:45,758 --> 00:27:47,560
Don't leave.

386
00:27:50,763 --> 00:27:52,732
I can drop you at home
after this Moses.

387
00:27:52,765 --> 00:27:54,634
Oh, no, I... I don't want to
put you out...

388
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:55,868
No, no trouble.

389
00:27:55,902 --> 00:27:58,404
I can do it after I've dropped
Milla at school.

390
00:27:58,437 --> 00:28:01,507
Hey, Moses, I don't know if you
make a habit of this or not

391
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,310
that is befriending girls

392
00:28:03,343 --> 00:28:05,312
that are significantly
younger than yourself.

393
00:28:05,345 --> 00:28:09,181
But Milla's in a very
vulnerable situation...

394
00:28:12,685 --> 00:28:14,520
Goddamn.

395
00:28:23,496 --> 00:28:24,931
Fuck!

396
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:26,198
Henry, can you grab his collar?

397
00:28:26,233 --> 00:28:27,767
- Yeah.
- Sorry. He's a car-chaser.

398
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,502
No problem.

399
00:28:29,535 --> 00:28:31,405
Hey, um, can you come and stand
on a stool for me?

400
00:28:31,437 --> 00:28:33,105
- All my lights keep blowing.
- Um...

401
00:28:33,139 --> 00:28:35,808
I don't trust myself within five
meters of a stool at the moment.

402
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:37,344
Um, I've just, I've got...

403
00:28:37,377 --> 00:28:39,779
- I've got patients that are waiting.
- Okay.

404
00:28:39,812 --> 00:28:41,281
Okay.

405
00:28:43,383 --> 00:28:45,319
- See ya.
- Bye.

406
00:28:46,786 --> 00:28:48,255
Henry.

407
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,179
I wanna see you again.

408
00:29:13,846 --> 00:29:15,681
No way.

409
00:29:15,715 --> 00:29:17,183
<i>Milla!</i>

410
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:21,854
Okay, bye, mum.

411
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:23,390
You'll let me know

412
00:29:23,423 --> 00:29:25,958
and I'll come and get you
if it's too much.

413
00:29:25,992 --> 00:29:27,461
Bye.

414
00:29:30,963 --> 00:29:33,467
- Where do you live, Moses?
- <i>Uh, just drop me up here.</i>

415
00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:35,901
Oh, no, I'll take you home.

416
00:29:38,804 --> 00:29:41,207
Thanks for the lift,
Mrs. Finlay.

417
00:29:41,241 --> 00:29:42,675
Moses!

418
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:49,582
Thank you.

419
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,387
I don't want you near
Milla again.

420
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,792
Yes, alright.

421
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:06,899
<i>I felt my, my body go cold.</i>

422
00:30:08,868 --> 00:30:10,803
<i>Like I knew.</i>

423
00:30:14,274 --> 00:30:16,008
<i>If I'd have just said...</i>

424
00:30:16,042 --> 00:30:17,676
God, if I'd just said don't.

425
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:20,212
If I'd just said
don't leave me...

426
00:30:20,247 --> 00:30:22,349
J... Jenny can I,
would you just ex...

427
00:30:22,382 --> 00:30:24,183
...just excuse me
for one moment, please.

428
00:30:24,216 --> 00:30:25,551
Mm-hm.

429
00:30:45,638 --> 00:30:47,573
I'm gonna change that bulb.

430
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:52,345
- Thanks.
- Right.

431
00:30:57,317 --> 00:31:00,387
Um, hold on a sec.

432
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,688
- <i>Got it?</i>
- Yeah, not yet.

433
00:31:03,823 --> 00:31:06,759
Ah, there we go.

434
00:31:07,993 --> 00:31:10,096
- Fuck!
- Fuck! Fuck!

435
00:31:11,498 --> 00:31:13,065
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
- No, no.

436
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:15,935
The electrics in these houses,
they're fucking crazy.

437
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,437
- Can you sit down?
- Oh, no, I'm okay.

438
00:31:17,471 --> 00:31:20,507
I'm so sorry, Henry.
I'm so sorry.

439
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,941
- Sit down. Please sit down.
- I'm okay.

440
00:31:21,974 --> 00:31:23,376
- No, I'm okay, I'm okay.
- Please, sit down.

441
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,845
- I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm fine.
- God!

442
00:31:25,878 --> 00:31:27,680
- Hope you're not brain damaged.
- No, I'm fine.

443
00:31:27,713 --> 00:31:29,048
Can I get you some water? Do you
want me to get you some water?

444
00:31:29,081 --> 00:31:30,584
- I'm fine.
- Fuck. Are you allowed water?

445
00:31:30,616 --> 00:31:32,751
What's that rule
with hair dryers?

446
00:31:34,854 --> 00:31:37,923
Oh, you can see
straight into our house.

447
00:31:37,957 --> 00:31:40,192
- Really?
- Yeah.

448
00:31:40,227 --> 00:31:42,094
Okay. Can I just...

449
00:31:42,128 --> 00:31:43,563
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Your hair's sticking up.

450
00:31:43,597 --> 00:31:45,064
Can I just...
Can you wait a second?

451
00:31:45,097 --> 00:31:47,467
Wait, I've got something
that will be perfect.

452
00:31:54,274 --> 00:31:58,077
This is gel,
but it smooths the hair.

453
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,614
Um, can I...
Okay, you do it.

454
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:02,982
Just don't be shy of it,
i... i... it goes completely...

455
00:32:03,015 --> 00:32:05,285
Actually, no, let me, here.

456
00:33:20,025 --> 00:33:22,828
Was that your boyfriend dropping
you off this morning?

457
00:33:22,861 --> 00:33:24,331
Yeah.

458
00:33:24,364 --> 00:33:27,066
Are you bringing him
to the formal?

459
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:29,034
Think so.

460
00:33:29,068 --> 00:33:31,003
What school does he go to?

461
00:33:32,104 --> 00:33:33,839
He's left school.

462
00:33:35,007 --> 00:33:36,842
My boyfriend's 18.

463
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,912
I love your wig.

464
00:33:39,945 --> 00:33:42,415
I wanna get extensions
for the formal.

465
00:33:42,449 --> 00:33:44,783
- <i>Cool.</i>
- Yeah.

466
00:33:44,817 --> 00:33:47,152
- Can I try it on?
- No.

467
00:33:47,186 --> 00:33:49,922
<i>Just to see how I'll look
with long hair.</i>

468
00:33:52,925 --> 00:33:56,296
- Just for a second.
- No.

469
00:33:56,329 --> 00:33:59,633
Please? I'll be quick.
I'll give it right back. Please?

470
00:34:01,468 --> 00:34:03,603
<i>Ha-ha. Yeah?</i>

471
00:34:27,126 --> 00:34:31,030
Oh, my God.
I look so different.

472
00:34:46,613 --> 00:34:48,914
It's to show my hairdresser.

473
00:34:50,082 --> 00:34:52,786
Oh, yeah, I love that.

474
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,759
It's better on you.

475
00:35:44,504 --> 00:35:46,105
<i>Oi!</i>

476
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:53,879
- What're you doing here?
- What're you doing here?

477
00:35:53,912 --> 00:35:57,317
- It's my school.
- It's my school.

478
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,084
<i>It's an all girl's school.</i>

479
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,554
- Shit.

480
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:04,223
Hey!

481
00:36:05,392 --> 00:36:07,192
Stop it.

482
00:36:25,545 --> 00:36:27,946
- <i>Milla?</i>
- What?

483
00:36:29,682 --> 00:36:31,851
<i>Where have you been?</i>

484
00:36:31,885 --> 00:36:34,454
- Ah, with Scarlett.
- Hey, sweetheart.

485
00:36:34,487 --> 00:36:36,623
- Hi.
- Feeling okay?

486
00:36:36,656 --> 00:36:39,091
Mm, okay.

487
00:36:41,561 --> 00:36:44,831
You should invite her over.

488
00:36:44,864 --> 00:36:48,635
Or is her mum still paying her
to be on that paleo diet?

489
00:36:48,668 --> 00:36:50,904
Mum, um...

490
00:36:50,936 --> 00:36:54,006
...I need some money
for tickets to the formal.

491
00:36:56,743 --> 00:36:59,245
- Okay.
- <i>Okay.</i>

492
00:37:01,748 --> 00:37:03,850
We'll have to go shopping
for a dress too.

493
00:37:03,883 --> 00:37:06,319
<i>Do you have any... any ideas?</i>

494
00:37:06,352 --> 00:37:07,754
Mm-hm.

495
00:37:07,787 --> 00:37:10,423
Maybe we could take tomorrow
morning off and...

496
00:37:10,457 --> 00:37:11,724
...go shopping.

497
00:37:11,758 --> 00:37:14,159
I don't want to miss
any more school.

498
00:37:16,796 --> 00:37:19,599
Are people taking partners, or...

499
00:37:19,632 --> 00:37:20,900
Oh, don't!

500
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:22,769
Th... that's because
foreign policy

501
00:37:22,802 --> 00:37:26,205
in this country is based
on this small mindedness.

502
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:28,475
Would you like me to ask
Andrea's son?

503
00:37:28,508 --> 00:37:30,042
Leif?

504
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,082
I'm not going with Leif.

505
00:37:38,751 --> 00:37:40,787
<i>...especially about
this strange</i>

506
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,756
<i>effusive character
that was Mozart.</i>

507
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,859
<i>It's unique music</i>

508
00:37:45,892 --> 00:37:48,461
<i>for expressing
tragic sentiment.</i>

509
00:37:48,495 --> 00:37:52,465
<i>Always with open-eyed wonder
for the world.</i>

510
00:37:52,499 --> 00:37:53,833
<i>Never is it cynical.</i>

511
00:37:53,867 --> 00:37:56,168
<i>It can be dark,
it can be menacing</i>

512
00:37:56,201 --> 00:37:58,304
<i>but essentially
it's extraordinarily</i>

513
00:37:58,338 --> 00:37:59,873
<i>optimistic music.</i>

514
00:37:59,906 --> 00:38:01,975
<i>And when Mozart is at his peak</i>

515
00:38:02,007 --> 00:38:05,177
<i>and sometimes he doesn't
always reach his peak</i>

516
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,614
<i>but when Mozart does write
at his peak</i>

517
00:38:07,647 --> 00:38:09,649
<i>such as the "25th Symphony"</i>

518
00:38:09,682 --> 00:38:10,950
<i>you're dealing with something</i>

519
00:38:10,984 --> 00:38:14,420
<i>that's indescribably
extraordinary.</i>

520
00:38:14,454 --> 00:38:17,557
<i>Um, this is an exploration
of the music of Mozart...</i>

521
00:38:51,658 --> 00:38:54,894
I think something in you
is changed.

522
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,067
What could it be?

523
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:06,039
I see the same in your mother
when she is in love.

524
00:39:06,071 --> 00:39:08,775
<i>Is when she is becoming
drunk with it.</i>

525
00:39:08,808 --> 00:39:11,209
When she met dad, you mean?

526
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:18,885
- <i>You were crazy about her.</i>
- Of course.

527
00:39:18,918 --> 00:39:21,721
- We play Shostakovich together.
- Were you together?

528
00:39:21,754 --> 00:39:23,022
<i>You never observe
this crescendo.</i>

529
00:39:23,056 --> 00:39:24,057
- Were you?
- <i>Look.</i>

530
00:39:24,089 --> 00:39:26,759
How many times I underline.

531
00:39:26,793 --> 00:39:29,662
You're not so breathless
this time.

532
00:39:29,696 --> 00:39:32,398
Come, lifting the wings...

533
00:39:38,738 --> 00:39:41,641
When you play this with focus

534
00:39:41,674 --> 00:39:44,811
it can make the heart so big.

535
00:39:44,844 --> 00:39:48,448
When you do bird calls
is so stupid.

536
00:40:09,469 --> 00:40:11,136
What're you looking at?

537
00:40:13,706 --> 00:40:15,308
Piss off

538
00:41:45,398 --> 00:41:48,000
Hi. Hi, Mrs. Finlay.
Is Milla here?

539
00:41:48,034 --> 00:41:50,570
- No. She's not.
- I brought her these.

540
00:41:50,603 --> 00:41:52,538
I brought her a present.

541
00:41:54,574 --> 00:41:56,109
You weren't in school.

542
00:41:56,142 --> 00:41:58,177
I didn't go today.

543
00:42:00,046 --> 00:42:02,048
Did you run here?

544
00:42:02,081 --> 00:42:04,250
I've been playing basketball.

545
00:42:04,283 --> 00:42:06,319
- Do you want to do something?
- No. She has to rest.

546
00:42:06,352 --> 00:42:09,422
- We can sit out back.
- No.

547
00:42:17,463 --> 00:42:19,632
Milla. Milla.

548
00:42:19,665 --> 00:42:21,567
- What are you thinking?
- What?

549
00:42:21,601 --> 00:42:24,570
Well, can't you see
the state he's in?

550
00:42:31,677 --> 00:42:34,080
Sorry, I couldn't find a cup.

551
00:43:12,151 --> 00:43:14,254
<i>I wanted to ask you something.</i>

552
00:43:14,288 --> 00:43:16,022
Uh-huh.

553
00:43:17,423 --> 00:43:20,126
Will you come to my school
formal?

554
00:43:24,697 --> 00:43:27,366
Aren't I a bit old for it?

555
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,701
No.

556
00:43:31,204 --> 00:43:33,172
Do I have to wear a suit?

557
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,609
I don't think so.

558
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,615
I'd like to wear one.

559
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:48,621
Oh, my God.

560
00:43:50,223 --> 00:43:51,657
My heart's beating so fast

561
00:43:51,691 --> 00:43:54,594
it feels like having a heart
attack or something.

562
00:43:55,695 --> 00:43:57,496
Feel that.

563
00:43:59,732 --> 00:44:02,635
I didn't think
it would be like that.

564
00:44:24,624 --> 00:44:27,760
- I think I'm going throw up.
- Hey?

565
00:44:30,429 --> 00:44:31,731
Mum!

566
00:44:35,335 --> 00:44:36,903
- Mum!
- Are you alright?

567
00:44:36,936 --> 00:44:39,071
Can you get me an Ondansetron?

568
00:44:39,105 --> 00:44:42,708
Sit up. Sit up. Sit up.

569
00:44:44,311 --> 00:44:47,513
Can you sit up? Milla.

570
00:44:47,546 --> 00:44:50,250
I know you have it.
It was right next to the phone.

571
00:44:50,284 --> 00:44:52,286
Give it to me right now.

572
00:44:57,056 --> 00:44:59,058
That's not it.

573
00:45:01,027 --> 00:45:03,397
Will you still come
to my formal?

574
00:45:03,429 --> 00:45:04,530
- No, he won't.
- Sorry.

575
00:45:04,563 --> 00:45:06,832
- Mo?
- No, he won't Milla.

576
00:45:06,866 --> 00:45:08,402
Have some self-respect.

577
00:45:08,434 --> 00:45:10,803
Is that why
you hang out with me?

578
00:45:10,836 --> 00:45:12,204
Yes.

579
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:14,640
Is it the only reason?

580
00:45:17,109 --> 00:45:18,678
Is it?

581
00:45:20,646 --> 00:45:23,582
<i>You have to leave Moses and you
can never come back here.</i>

582
00:45:29,588 --> 00:45:32,458
Sit up, honey.
Sit up, honey.

583
00:45:32,491 --> 00:45:35,094
Come on. Have another sip.

584
00:45:40,066 --> 00:45:41,667
Fuck!

585
00:45:42,835 --> 00:45:45,204
Fuck it! Fuck!

586
00:46:25,578 --> 00:46:28,382
- Yeah, nice. Yo.
- Hey, Mo, Bambi's here.

587
00:46:28,415 --> 00:46:29,682
Hey?

588
00:46:40,593 --> 00:46:42,429
The hell are you doing here?

589
00:46:42,462 --> 00:46:44,597
What the hell
are you doing here?

590
00:46:45,664 --> 00:46:47,767
Does your mum know
where you are?

591
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,469
Does yours?

592
00:46:53,473 --> 00:46:56,443
You can't hang.
I've got to go to work now.

593
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,908
Tracy Marrow?

594
00:48:35,941 --> 00:48:37,743
Yes, sir.

595
00:48:48,622 --> 00:48:51,324
- Cheers mate.
- Yep.

596
00:49:01,133 --> 00:49:04,638
My brother's doing a party
tonight. You should come.

597
00:49:06,573 --> 00:49:07,973
Alright.

598
00:49:15,415 --> 00:49:17,016
<i>Where's it at?</i>

599
00:49:17,049 --> 00:49:19,785
- <i>Brian's place.</i>
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

600
00:49:46,379 --> 00:49:49,114
Hey, we won't stay here long,
okay?

601
00:49:49,148 --> 00:49:51,418
Unless it's really fun.

602
00:49:54,287 --> 00:49:56,323
You're really pretty.

603
00:50:15,841 --> 00:50:18,077
I love this.

604
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:20,746
Are you avoiding me?

605
00:50:20,779 --> 00:50:21,914
No.

606
00:50:23,048 --> 00:50:24,351
Good.

607
00:50:30,022 --> 00:50:32,325
<i>Hey, Mill, do you want to...
Mill?</i>

608
00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:35,528
- <i>Do you wanna go dance?</i>
- Yeah.

609
00:50:35,562 --> 00:50:37,631
<i>I'll meet you in there.</i>

610
00:50:37,664 --> 00:50:39,733
<i>Are you babysitting?</i>

611
00:52:36,249 --> 00:52:37,817
<i>Hey.</i>

612
00:52:40,387 --> 00:52:42,789
Hey.
Can you get me a drink?

613
00:53:44,216 --> 00:53:46,386
Hey. Hey! Are you drunk?

614
00:53:46,419 --> 00:53:48,120
- Where's your girlfriend?
- Hey?

615
00:53:48,153 --> 00:53:50,122
Where's your girlfriend?

616
00:53:52,725 --> 00:53:54,294
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

617
00:53:54,327 --> 00:53:56,362
Fucking loser.

618
00:53:56,396 --> 00:53:58,898
Hey! Fuck! Fuck off!

619
00:54:00,165 --> 00:54:01,234
<i>Hey!</i>

620
00:54:08,374 --> 00:54:10,108
You okay?

621
00:54:15,915 --> 00:54:18,618
What is this?
What did you take? Mill?

622
00:54:20,986 --> 00:54:22,288
Vodka.

623
00:54:24,089 --> 00:54:26,559
Are you allowed to drink
on your medication?

624
00:54:27,794 --> 00:54:29,696
It's never come up.

625
00:54:31,231 --> 00:54:35,000
- I'm gonna ring your parents.
- No.

626
00:54:35,033 --> 00:54:38,404
No. Not yet, Mo.

627
00:54:38,438 --> 00:54:39,973
Not yet.

Where's my house?
Would it be over there?

649
00:56:39,459 --> 00:56:41,694
No, it's much more...

650
00:56:41,728 --> 00:56:43,429
...in this direction.

651
00:56:44,797 --> 00:56:47,165
You see that?
That's your school.

652
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:50,403
- Uh-huh.
- This down here is, um...

653
00:56:50,436 --> 00:56:52,038
When, uh...

654
00:56:55,108 --> 00:56:57,744
That's, uh, where we were today.

655
00:56:59,879 --> 00:57:02,081
Moses, do you like me?

656
00:57:06,886 --> 00:57:08,888
Obviously.

657
00:57:09,922 --> 00:57:12,825
But do you like, like-like me?

658
00:57:25,038 --> 00:57:26,305
Hey.

659
00:57:27,774 --> 00:57:29,442
It's complicated.

660
00:57:31,944 --> 00:57:34,347
I don't wanna hurt you.

661
00:57:37,483 --> 00:57:39,385
So don't.

662
00:58:07,013 --> 00:58:08,848
I'll be back in a minute.

663
00:58:08,881 --> 00:58:10,249
- I'm coming with you.
- No, no. No, no.

664
00:58:10,283 --> 00:58:12,318
Go back to sleep.
Go back to sleep.

665
00:58:25,932 --> 00:58:30,069
She didn't take any
of her medicine?

666
00:58:30,103 --> 00:58:33,005
I hope he doesn't just stick
a needle in her arm.

667
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:35,908
Why did she not at least take
her phone with her?

668
00:58:37,443 --> 00:58:39,912
Come on, Milla.

669
00:58:39,946 --> 00:58:42,115
How did we not see this coming?

670
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:45,918
Henry?

671
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,756
Did you hear me?

672
00:58:49,789 --> 00:58:51,557
I'm up with her every night,
Henry.

673
00:58:51,591 --> 00:58:54,293
Her body gets so hot.
You're never there.

674
00:58:54,327 --> 00:58:57,764
I am. I'm there. I'm always
there. You just don't notice.

675
00:58:57,797 --> 00:58:59,233
<i>Well, I can't find you.</i>

676
00:58:59,265 --> 00:59:02,001
Even now I have no idea
what you're feeling.

677
00:59:02,034 --> 00:59:03,703
'Cause you don't tell me.

678
00:59:03,736 --> 00:59:07,273
<i>Tell me Henry, because I feel
so alone right now.</i>

679
00:59:07,306 --> 00:59:08,741
This really isn't about you,
Anna.

680
00:59:08,775 --> 00:59:10,009
It... it... it is.

681
00:59:10,042 --> 00:59:12,078
It's really not about
how you feel!

682
00:59:12,111 --> 00:59:15,114
This is about Milla,
for God's sake!

683
00:59:15,148 --> 00:59:17,150
Wh... what's wrong with you?

684
00:59:17,183 --> 00:59:18,618
Our daughter has disappeared.

685
00:59:18,651 --> 00:59:20,720
She might not make it
through the night

686
00:59:20,753 --> 00:59:22,088
and, and, and

687
00:59:22,121 --> 00:59:24,490
a... a I can't feel anything

688
00:59:24,524 --> 00:59:25,625
because I can't breathe.

689
00:59:25,658 --> 00:59:27,760
'Cause you take up all the air.

690
00:59:27,794 --> 00:59:30,062
<i>Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Okay.</i>

691
00:59:30,096 --> 00:59:32,565
<i>Anna, I'm sorry.
Anna, darling, I'm sorry.</i>

692
00:59:32,598 --> 00:59:34,901
<i>I just want to find...</i>

693
00:59:34,934 --> 00:59:36,969
Excuse me.

694
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:41,140
Have you seen this girl?
Excuse me.

695
00:59:41,174 --> 00:59:43,543
Can you just look?

696
00:59:44,844 --> 00:59:48,648
Excuse me.
Have you seen this girl?

697
00:59:48,681 --> 00:59:51,017
Ha... have you seen this girl?

698
01:00:57,450 --> 01:00:59,986
Let's go home.

699
01:01:00,686 --> 01:01:03,055
Oh, baby.

700
01:01:08,094 --> 01:01:10,997
Not yet, sweetheart.

701
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:13,432
You've got a chest infection.

702
01:01:17,503 --> 01:01:19,405
Please, mum.

703
01:01:21,107 --> 01:01:23,910
We have to get you better first.

704
01:01:23,943 --> 01:01:25,645
It won't take long.

705
01:01:25,678 --> 01:01:29,181
- You always say that.
- It's true this time.

706
01:01:32,184 --> 01:01:34,186
You say that too.

707
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:37,324
Mill! Mill, stop it!

708
01:01:37,357 --> 01:01:39,959
Milla! What, are you trying
to kill yourself?

709
01:01:39,992 --> 01:01:42,329
He won't find me here.

710
01:01:42,362 --> 01:01:43,529
Milla.

711
01:01:46,666 --> 01:01:49,101
Come on, darling.

712
01:01:49,135 --> 01:01:51,604
Come back here. Come on.

713
01:01:58,678 --> 01:02:02,481
<i>He... Henry, can you come
and feel the water pressure?</i>

714
01:02:03,482 --> 01:02:05,751
<i>Henry?</i>

715
01:02:05,785 --> 01:02:08,454
Darling, I checked it
this morning. It was fine.

716
01:02:08,487 --> 01:02:11,991
<i>Well, it's very weak now.
Can you come and feel it.</i>

717
01:02:15,094 --> 01:02:16,929
<i>Henry!</i>

718
01:02:16,963 --> 01:02:19,433
I felt it this morning,
it was fine.

719
01:02:20,766 --> 01:02:23,169
Henry, just come and check
the water pressure

720
01:02:23,202 --> 01:02:27,139
with my concerns in mind
and see if it's too weak.

721
01:02:27,173 --> 01:02:30,676
It's just a basic conjugal duty.
Jesus!

722
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:34,348
Hey, there's water there.
Don't slip.

723
01:02:34,381 --> 01:02:37,384
Hurry up. Come on, I've got to
get to the hospital.

724
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:43,723
Milla's obsessed with that boy.

725
01:02:43,756 --> 01:02:46,892
- She's a smart girl.
- This is her first love.

726
01:02:46,926 --> 01:02:49,996
- She'll get over it.
- You don't just get over it.

727
01:02:50,029 --> 01:02:51,431
I'm pretty sure
that she won't be

728
01:02:51,465 --> 01:02:54,434
strong enough to save herself.

729
01:02:54,468 --> 01:02:58,204
- She's not like you, Anna.
- I'm not saying that she is.

730
01:02:58,238 --> 01:02:59,373
What do you mean?

731
01:02:59,406 --> 01:03:01,274
- It's fine.
- No, it's...

732
01:03:01,308 --> 01:03:02,875
Exactly the same the same
as it was this morning.

733
01:03:02,908 --> 01:03:05,345
- Have you taken your Ativan?
- It's still weak.

734
01:03:05,379 --> 01:03:07,347
Have you taken your Ativan?
Because you'd better.

735
01:03:07,381 --> 01:03:09,749
- I don't take them anymore.
- Since when?

736
01:03:09,782 --> 01:03:13,119
Since Milla came back.
I'm off everything.

737
01:03:13,152 --> 01:03:15,955
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Uh-uh.

738
01:03:15,988 --> 01:03:17,424
This is the worst
possible timing.

739
01:03:17,457 --> 01:03:20,460
I don't want to miss anything,
Henry.

740
01:03:21,961 --> 01:03:24,163
I'm fine without them, you know.

741
01:03:24,196 --> 01:03:26,565
- Just my back's been...
- No.

742
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:29,503
- What're you doing?
- You're just exhausting.

743
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:32,406
Okay, it was the shower, Henry.
It's reasonable.

744
01:03:32,439 --> 01:03:34,573
No. It's not reasonable, Anna.

745
01:03:34,607 --> 01:03:38,677
It's... it's,
it's not reasonable Anna.

746
01:03:38,711 --> 01:03:40,380
You just, you cannot

747
01:03:40,414 --> 01:03:45,519
cannot, cannot, cannot,
cannot lose it yet.

748
01:03:45,551 --> 01:03:47,454
You cannot.

749
01:04:04,271 --> 01:04:06,239
Mm-hmm. Ah-ha.

750
01:04:06,273 --> 01:04:09,742
But you see, uh, uh,
this violin is mine.

751
01:04:09,775 --> 01:04:12,645
It's too big.

752
01:04:12,678 --> 01:04:15,147
Milla learned that song.

753
01:04:15,181 --> 01:04:17,183
Yeah.
He is in love with her.

754
01:04:17,216 --> 01:04:19,319
- No, I'm not!
- You are.

755
01:04:19,352 --> 01:04:21,887
You don't know yet. Eh. Here.

756
01:04:21,921 --> 01:04:25,057
<i>Here, go and get yourself
a coffee, uh</i>

757
01:04:25,091 --> 01:04:27,494
or whatever you like, huh?

758
01:04:27,527 --> 01:04:31,130
Come back with longer arms
please and we will work more.

759
01:04:33,467 --> 01:04:35,335
What?

760
01:04:35,368 --> 01:04:37,304
It's good to see you.

761
01:04:39,805 --> 01:04:44,244
Can you turn...
Can you turn to face the piano?

762
01:04:45,678 --> 01:04:48,448
Please. Come on.

763
01:04:48,482 --> 01:04:51,217
- Mm...
- Come on.

764
01:04:51,251 --> 01:04:53,253
Oh, stop it.

765
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:59,892
Anna, please. Play with me.

766
01:05:00,759 --> 01:05:02,795
I don't want to.

767
01:05:02,828 --> 01:05:05,499
I believe you do want to.

768
01:05:06,765 --> 01:05:08,200
Hm?

769
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,642
Gidon, stop... Stop it!

770
01:05:20,514 --> 01:05:22,681
We can fight if you want to.

771
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:25,418
Is that why you come?

772
01:05:37,464 --> 01:05:39,432
Do you remember
when we were doing the Sculhof

773
01:05:39,466 --> 01:05:41,167
how I couldn't go on?

774
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,469
Hm.

775
01:05:44,571 --> 01:05:47,240
- In Hamburg, remember?
- Hm.

776
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:54,281
Milla was five months...

777
01:05:54,314 --> 01:05:55,915
...and I left her crying
with that woman

778
01:05:55,948 --> 01:05:57,950
I couldn't even understand.

779
01:06:02,522 --> 01:06:04,723
I wasn't ready to stop then.

780
01:06:06,459 --> 01:06:08,928
I should have been the one
who was holding her.

781
01:06:13,567 --> 01:06:15,768
I want that time back.

782
01:06:15,801 --> 01:06:19,673
You think Milla will get better
if you stop playing?

783
01:06:22,676 --> 01:06:25,211
I don't have anything else
to give.

784
01:06:25,245 --> 01:06:28,582
Fuck the tiny gods
in your head, Anna.

785
01:06:28,615 --> 01:06:33,353
Milla's mother plays the piano.

786
01:06:40,793 --> 01:06:43,896
Hi! Henry! Henry!

787
01:06:43,929 --> 01:06:45,764
Henry!

788
01:06:46,999 --> 01:06:48,767
Fuck! Henry!

789
01:06:48,801 --> 01:06:50,470
Motherfucker.

790
01:06:51,571 --> 01:06:53,872
I unpacked the cups last night.

791
01:06:53,906 --> 01:06:55,841
Do you wanna come
and have a cup of tea with me?

792
01:06:55,874 --> 01:06:58,712
Well, what... Uh...

793
01:06:58,744 --> 01:07:01,814
W... what have you been using
for the last month?

794
01:07:01,847 --> 01:07:03,015
Jars.

795
01:07:12,091 --> 01:07:14,327
- You alright?
- Yeah.

796
01:07:15,362 --> 01:07:16,929
Me too.

797
01:07:18,598 --> 01:07:20,966
This baby's such an asshole
though.

798
01:07:22,335 --> 01:07:24,036
He's kicking me
all the fucking time now.

799
01:07:24,069 --> 01:07:26,171
Hm.

800
01:07:26,205 --> 01:07:27,773
Come here.

801
01:07:29,141 --> 01:07:30,209
Oh!

802
01:07:30,243 --> 01:07:31,478
That's his bum there. Is it?

803
01:07:31,511 --> 01:07:33,580
Yeah, there... And shoulder.

804
01:07:33,613 --> 01:07:36,750
Ah. Oh-ho! It's quite lively.

805
01:07:36,782 --> 01:07:38,451
- Did you feel that?
- Yeah.

806
01:07:38,485 --> 01:07:39,985
He likes the sound
of your voice.

807
01:07:40,019 --> 01:07:41,521
Yeah.

808
01:07:55,235 --> 01:07:58,505
I'm... sorry.

809
01:07:58,538 --> 01:07:59,938
It was nice.

810
01:07:59,972 --> 01:08:02,174
- Shit.
- No, no. It doesn't matter.

811
01:08:02,207 --> 01:08:03,677
Sorry.

812
01:08:09,181 --> 01:08:10,750
Uh, sorry.

813
01:08:35,608 --> 01:08:39,346
- I brought you some...
- Yeah, I don't...

814
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,349
I don't wanna talk about it.

815
01:08:42,382 --> 01:08:45,117
You don't get to do this, Henry.

816
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:48,655
Um, I can't... talk.

817
01:08:49,221 --> 01:08:50,690
Um...

818
01:08:53,626 --> 01:08:54,927
How long
has this been going on?

819
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,162
I just can't talk right now,
honey.

820
01:08:57,196 --> 01:08:59,965
- What?
- It's the first time.

821
01:08:59,998 --> 01:09:02,635
- It's the first time. It's...
- What?

822
01:09:03,436 --> 01:09:06,339
Uh...

823
01:09:06,373 --> 01:09:07,640
It's just morphine.

824
01:09:07,674 --> 01:09:09,476
It's just a little bit
of morphine.

825
01:09:09,509 --> 01:09:11,043
It's alright.

826
01:09:41,974 --> 01:09:43,543
It's okay.

827
01:09:47,747 --> 01:09:50,784
We're losing her, aren't we?

828
01:09:52,285 --> 01:09:56,289
We're losing her.
What the fuck are we gonna do?

829
01:10:01,093 --> 01:10:03,061
What are we gonna do?

830
01:10:08,967 --> 01:10:10,770
Moses!

831
01:10:10,804 --> 01:10:13,873
Moses, I just wanna talk.

832
01:10:13,907 --> 01:10:15,642
No, no. I just...
I just wanna talk.

833
01:10:15,675 --> 01:10:17,510
- Whoa! Whoa!
- I just wanna...

834
01:10:17,544 --> 01:10:20,045
I said I just want...

835
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:23,048
Henry! Henry! Henry.

836
01:10:23,949 --> 01:10:27,253
Is... Is she dead? Is she dead?

837
01:10:27,287 --> 01:10:29,154
- No.
- Is she de...

838
01:10:32,392 --> 01:10:33,560
Oh!

839
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:40,900
What were you doing?

840
01:10:40,934 --> 01:10:43,369
What are you doing leaving there
in the middle of the night?

841
01:10:43,403 --> 01:10:44,637
What kind of...

842
01:10:44,671 --> 01:10:47,574
What kind of fucking person
are you?

843
01:10:49,074 --> 01:10:50,877
And I came back.

844
01:10:52,345 --> 01:10:54,314
I did. I came back for her.

845
01:10:54,347 --> 01:10:56,215
It all just got fucked.

846
01:10:58,518 --> 01:11:00,420
Will you come and stay with us?

847
01:11:00,453 --> 01:11:02,922
I can get you what you need.

848
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:05,190
What?

849
01:11:07,627 --> 01:11:09,562
I don't like you.

850
01:11:10,996 --> 01:11:14,132
But Milla thinks
you're something special.

851
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:17,202
She should have the world
at her feet right now.

852
01:11:20,573 --> 01:11:23,041
I can write you prescriptions.

853
01:11:25,645 --> 01:11:27,814
Come and stay with us.

854
01:11:36,856 --> 01:11:37,924
Ow.

855
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:45,698
Who did this to you?

856
01:11:45,732 --> 01:11:48,935
- It was your dad mostly.
- No, who did it?

857
01:11:53,873 --> 01:11:57,042
What? What the fuck... Oh!

858
01:11:58,478 --> 01:12:00,112
It was you!

859
01:12:02,382 --> 01:12:04,116
No. Just some dickheads.

860
01:12:05,985 --> 01:12:08,721
- And your dad.
- No.

861
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:18,565
Do you want another beer, Henry?
Oh, you're on wine.

862
01:12:18,598 --> 01:12:21,401
- Anna?
- No, thanks.

863
01:12:21,434 --> 01:12:23,002
I love those chrysanthemums.

864
01:12:23,036 --> 01:12:25,038
They're just like
such an explosion, aren't they?

865
01:12:25,070 --> 01:12:28,641
- Hm, they're dahlias, actually.
- I love that color.

866
01:12:28,675 --> 01:12:30,810
It's so deep... Excuse me.

867
01:12:30,843 --> 01:12:33,111
It's so deep in the middle.

868
01:12:35,281 --> 01:12:37,951
Dad! No! That was with food
falling out of my mouth!

869
01:12:37,984 --> 01:12:41,554
- Well, take another one, Henry.
- First, let me finish.

870
01:12:42,422 --> 01:12:43,923
- Okay.
- Ready?

871
01:12:43,957 --> 01:12:45,157
Mm-hm.

872
01:12:46,059 --> 01:12:47,226
Oh, that's nice.

873
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:49,829
Oh, that's very cute.
Hold on. There we go.

874
01:12:49,862 --> 01:12:51,230
- How's that?
- Milla, give me a look...

875
01:12:51,264 --> 01:12:52,765
Get your...
Oh, no, that'll do it.

876
01:12:52,799 --> 01:12:56,069
- Okay. Okay.
- Alright. Alright. Just...

877
01:12:56,101 --> 01:12:57,737
I'll get some more dahlias
tomorrow.

878
01:12:57,770 --> 01:13:00,138
Oh, no, I think
we're okay for flowers.

879
01:13:00,172 --> 01:13:02,207
Oh, you have to just go for it
with dahlias.

880
01:13:02,241 --> 01:13:04,010
The... the... the season
is so short.

881
01:13:04,043 --> 01:13:05,612
- I know.
- Uh, like, uh...

882
01:13:05,645 --> 01:13:07,013
It's like horse mushroom season.

883
01:13:07,046 --> 01:13:08,815
My dad used to say
that horse mushroom season

884
01:13:08,848 --> 01:13:11,918
was, like, the best time
of the year.

885
01:13:11,951 --> 01:13:14,119
It'd be good to meet your dad
sometime, Moses.

886
01:13:14,152 --> 01:13:15,655
He'd love that!

887
01:13:17,390 --> 01:13:20,093
- Uh, outside.
- Oh.

888
01:13:24,998 --> 01:13:27,300
- When's horse mushroom season?
- Huh?

889
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:29,869
No idea, darling. No idea.

890
01:13:30,637 --> 01:13:32,071
Stop!

891
01:13:47,587 --> 01:13:48,921
Anna?

892
01:13:51,156 --> 01:13:54,661
I thought I heard something?
Did you?

893
01:13:58,297 --> 01:14:00,066
No.

894
01:14:00,099 --> 01:14:02,802
It must have been
my imagination.

895
01:14:05,304 --> 01:14:09,207
Anna? Hey, what detergent
do you use?

896
01:14:10,843 --> 01:14:13,613
Are you sleep talking?

897
01:14:13,646 --> 01:14:14,947
No.

898
01:14:14,981 --> 01:14:18,885
These sheets smell so good.

899
01:14:22,922 --> 01:14:24,991
I forgot what it's called.

900
01:14:25,024 --> 01:14:27,126
Do you wanna know now?

901
01:14:28,961 --> 01:14:30,730
It can wait till morning.

902
01:14:32,165 --> 01:14:33,366
Moses...

903
01:14:34,767 --> 01:14:37,202
...does your mother know
where you are?

904
01:14:44,343 --> 01:14:45,411
No.

905
01:14:48,481 --> 01:14:50,783
Don't you think she'd like to?

906
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,823
Milla said she used to sleep
under the piano.

907
01:14:56,856 --> 01:15:00,159
Yeah. She did.

908
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:04,397
She liked the feeling
of the vibrations.

909
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:09,068
She used to just... curl up
underneath.

910
01:15:09,102 --> 01:15:11,437
Like this.

911
01:15:12,672 --> 01:15:14,941
And wrap her whole body
around it.

912
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:33,493
You get some sleep.

913
01:15:51,711 --> 01:15:55,114
- Milla?
- Mm?

914
01:15:55,148 --> 01:15:58,885
- Can I sleep with you?
- Mm-hm.

915
01:16:28,248 --> 01:16:30,516
Ah! Fuck it!

916
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:31,984
It was good, Mo.

917
01:16:33,319 --> 01:16:36,923
He just needs to let go
of some of the tension in his...

918
01:16:38,791 --> 01:16:41,127
He's just a perfectionist.

919
01:16:48,968 --> 01:16:52,038
- Mum, play with me?
- I-I don't know. I...

920
01:16:52,071 --> 01:16:53,940
<i>We can play the "Le Cygne."</i>

921
01:16:55,408 --> 01:16:58,477
- I think you should rest.
- Mum, what do you wanna play?

922
01:17:01,447 --> 01:17:04,450
I just... I just I want you
to get better.

923
01:17:11,190 --> 01:17:13,359
I'm going out for a bit.

924
01:17:14,228 --> 01:17:17,463
Can you keep your eye on them?

925
01:17:17,496 --> 01:17:18,631
Yeah.

926
01:17:26,372 --> 01:17:30,042
This is the worst possible
parenting I can imagine.

927
01:17:34,647 --> 01:17:35,848
Okay.

928
01:18:22,628 --> 01:18:23,930
Hi.

929
01:18:23,963 --> 01:18:26,465
Can you put these
in water for me?

930
01:18:29,468 --> 01:18:31,305
Mill?

931
01:18:31,338 --> 01:18:33,273
Do you still wanna take him
to your formal?

932
01:18:34,707 --> 01:18:36,075
Do you want to?

933
01:18:47,954 --> 01:18:49,855
- Try it on.
- Oh, my God.

934
01:18:49,889 --> 01:18:52,158
Try it on. Try it on.
Try it on.

935
01:19:31,831 --> 01:19:33,799
<i>How is it?</i>

936
01:19:33,833 --> 01:19:35,302
It's perfect.

937
01:19:40,506 --> 01:19:41,941
Turn around.

938
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:55,654
You look so beautiful.

939
01:19:57,324 --> 01:19:58,691
Maybe we could just put
a dart...

940
01:19:58,724 --> 01:20:01,594
I just wanna show Mo first.

941
01:20:04,030 --> 01:20:05,664
I love it, mum.

942
01:20:09,236 --> 01:20:11,438
You are my dream girl.

943
01:20:11,471 --> 01:20:14,274
Mo, I just found this thing
under my arm.

944
01:20:17,576 --> 01:20:20,546
- What sort of thing?
- A lump.

945
01:20:22,315 --> 01:20:24,717
Do you know what it means?

946
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:26,286
Really, um...

947
01:20:27,421 --> 01:20:31,023
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothin'.

948
01:20:31,057 --> 01:20:32,558
<i>Are you stoned?</i>

949
01:20:33,726 --> 01:20:35,395
Henry sorted me out.

950
01:20:42,735 --> 01:20:44,471
- Henry!
- But it's cool.

951
01:20:44,504 --> 01:20:46,072
- Henry!
- What is it? What's he...

952
01:20:46,105 --> 01:20:47,907
- You've been drugging him, dad?
- Oh...

953
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:50,343
- Well, it's nothing illicit.
- What? To keep him here?

954
01:20:50,377 --> 01:20:51,811
- <i>No.</i>
- No. It just...

955
01:20:51,844 --> 01:20:53,480
<i>It's pres...
Just, just prescrip...</i>

956
01:20:53,513 --> 01:20:55,181
Prescribed by you, dad! You've...

957
01:20:55,214 --> 01:20:56,816
You've made him
into some kind of hooker.

958
01:20:56,849 --> 01:21:00,186
- Well, sex isn't part of it.
- Did you know?

959
01:21:02,121 --> 01:21:03,557
You'd given up
on everything else.

960
01:21:03,589 --> 01:21:05,991
You think I can't take the fact
he doesn't love me back?

961
01:21:06,025 --> 01:21:07,461
You can't treat people
like that.

962
01:21:07,494 --> 01:21:09,795
Yeah, but Mill, it worked.

963
01:21:09,829 --> 01:21:12,332
You're so stupid!

964
01:21:12,365 --> 01:21:15,535
You... you think you can fix
things by handing out drugs.

965
01:21:15,569 --> 01:21:17,437
I mean, my God.
I have no idea who she is.

966
01:21:17,471 --> 01:21:19,872
You keep her so fucking high.

967
01:21:19,905 --> 01:21:21,508
I'm off everything actually.

968
01:21:21,541 --> 01:21:24,311
Except I had a half
a sleeping tablet last night.

969
01:21:24,344 --> 01:21:26,846
You think you can fix things
by paying off some junkie?

970
01:21:26,879 --> 01:21:29,081
You think that's what I need
from my dad?

971
01:21:29,115 --> 01:21:31,050
Oh, Mill,
it's not what this was.

972
01:21:31,083 --> 01:21:32,818
Mill, I'm not here
'cause of the drugs.

973
01:21:32,852 --> 01:21:35,355
- They're shit anyway.
- Why are you here?

974
01:21:35,388 --> 01:21:36,822
I care about you.

975
01:21:37,723 --> 01:21:38,724
<i>You're lying.</i>

976
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:42,229
<i>You're always
a million miles away going</i>

977
01:21:42,262 --> 01:21:43,629
<i>"What can I get
out of this person..."</i>

978
01:21:43,662 --> 01:21:44,864
You're just being nasty.

979
01:21:44,897 --> 01:21:46,198
When I met you it was like...

980
01:21:46,233 --> 01:21:48,634
I can't believe it,
it was like...

981
01:21:48,667 --> 01:21:50,803
...you weren't scared
of anything.

982
01:21:50,836 --> 01:21:52,905
<i>But it's because
you don't give a shit.</i>

983
01:21:52,938 --> 01:21:55,475
<i>I mean, all that crap
about horse mushroom season!</i>

984
01:21:55,509 --> 01:21:59,312
Do you even know? Do you
even know who your father is?

985
01:21:59,346 --> 01:22:02,081
Fuck you.
You're so fucking perfect.

986
01:22:02,114 --> 01:22:03,550
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

987
01:22:03,583 --> 01:22:07,387
- You think you're so perfect?
- <i>No, I don't.</i>

988
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:10,022
You lie all the time.

989
01:22:10,055 --> 01:22:11,790
<i>You wanna tell them?</i>

990
01:22:14,193 --> 01:22:17,430
- What?
- She's got a lump.

991
01:22:17,464 --> 01:22:18,831
What?

992
01:22:18,864 --> 01:22:20,400
She's got a lump.

993
01:22:24,538 --> 01:22:26,573
Milla?

994
01:22:26,606 --> 01:22:28,140
Is that true?

995
01:22:32,312 --> 01:22:35,981
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out.

996
01:22:36,015 --> 01:22:38,150
Go!

997
01:22:38,184 --> 01:22:40,953
Stop wasting my time!

998
01:24:12,878 --> 01:24:14,648
Hey, Zachy.

999
01:24:17,684 --> 01:24:20,654
Hey, come and open the door.

1000
01:24:26,025 --> 01:24:27,460
Well, come on.

1001
01:24:36,436 --> 01:24:38,471
Isaac! Come on!

1002
01:24:41,274 --> 01:24:43,510
Hey, I just wanna see you!

1003
01:24:43,543 --> 01:24:45,944
I thought you were my mate!

1004
01:24:57,357 --> 01:24:58,792
You can't keep doing this,
Moses.

1005
01:25:26,820 --> 01:25:28,254
Milla...

1006
01:25:29,823 --> 01:25:31,591
...if you die I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

1007
01:25:31,624 --> 01:25:34,761
- I'm going to scream.
- Can you just hear me out?

1008
01:25:37,297 --> 01:25:39,566
I never went camping
with my dad.

1009
01:25:45,037 --> 01:25:48,408
I stayed with him one time,
one Christmas

1010
01:25:48,441 --> 01:25:51,043
and he hardly even talked to me.

1011
01:25:57,082 --> 01:25:58,951
He was working in this
restaurant where he was fucking

1012
01:25:58,984 --> 01:26:01,688
the manager in his car
every night

1013
01:26:01,721 --> 01:26:05,023
and I had to wait in the carpark
until he was finished.

1014
01:26:09,194 --> 01:26:11,531
I never told mum.

1015
01:26:11,564 --> 01:26:14,834
I told her that we slept
in treehouses and shot birds.

1016
01:26:20,707 --> 01:26:24,577
I want to be with you... Milla.

1017
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,682
I don't know how to do this.

1018
01:26:47,267 --> 01:26:49,001
I win.

1019
01:26:50,102 --> 01:26:51,471
Oh!

1020

1021
01:26:58,912 --> 01:27:00,447
Yeah.

1022
01:27:05,083 --> 01:27:06,820
Do you wanna eat that?

1023
01:27:48,394 --> 01:27:51,931
Can we just do one more,
until I win one?

1024
01:27:51,965 --> 01:27:53,131

Hey, Mo.

I've heard that you're

Isaac said you did it

Isaac! What the...

You were really good.
S... so I told her.

1048
01:30:20,613 --> 01:30:23,116
- For my birthday.
- Don't pull that card!

1049
01:30:23,148 --> 01:30:26,586
Oh, you can't refuse
the birthday girl.

01:31:08,695 --> 01:31:11,397
- That was excellent.
- Mum?

1055
01:31:11,431 --> 01:31:13,198
Will you play with me?

1056

- Mm-hm.

1060

Do you... Do you have a car?

I don't think I can take
another morning, Mo.

1066
01:35:06,032 --> 01:35:08,968
- Do you want some morphine?
- No.

1067
01:35:15,342 --> 01:35:17,344
Will you do something for me?

1068
01:35:18,744 --> 01:35:20,579
You know I will.

1069
01:35:24,083 --> 01:35:26,852
Will you take this pillow...

1070
01:35:26,886 --> 01:35:29,455
...and just hold it
over my face?

1071
01:35:37,596 --> 01:35:39,465
If my body starts to tense
or it looks like

1072
01:35:39,498 --> 01:35:43,202
I've changed my mind,
just push harder.

1073
01:35:43,236 --> 01:35:45,272
That's just what bodies do,
something in it fights

1074
01:35:45,305 --> 01:35:47,039
but it's not me.

1075
01:35:50,109 --> 01:35:52,312
Hey, I'm not gonna do this.

1076
01:35:53,145 --> 01:35:55,282
Don't leave it unfinished.

1077
01:35:56,816 --> 01:35:59,852
Wait until my hips drop open
and there's no hold in my spine.

1078
01:35:59,885 --> 01:36:02,255
Then you can take
the pillow away.

1079
01:36:05,292 --> 01:36:06,892
Hey, if you want
to kill yourself

1080
01:36:06,926 --> 01:36:09,495
get your dad to give you
too much morphine.

1081
01:36:12,466 --> 01:36:14,200
It would kill dad.

1082
01:36:15,201 --> 01:36:17,437
This way I just stop breathing.

1083
01:36:21,607 --> 01:36:23,343
No. Fuck no.

1084
01:36:27,314 --> 01:36:29,648
I know what happens from here.

1085
01:36:32,184 --> 01:36:34,321
This body, it's too much.

1086
01:36:36,989 --> 01:36:40,360
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

1087
01:36:40,394 --> 01:36:44,231
And it just...
It gets more painful, Mo.

1088
01:36:58,245 --> 01:37:00,247
Please don't ask me to do this.

1089
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:01,515
Please.

1090
01:37:02,948 --> 01:37:05,184
I need you to help me.

1091
01:37:28,908 --> 01:37:31,210
- Can I have a sip?
- Yeah.

1092
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:10,216
I'm sorry, Mo.

1093
01:38:16,856 --> 01:38:19,259
I know you love me too.

1094
01:38:22,728 --> 01:38:24,730
Not any more, I don't.

1095
01:38:30,836 --> 01:38:33,573
<i>Don't stop pushing.</i>

1096
01:38:33,607 --> 01:38:36,510
Your body has to bear me down.
Okay?

1097
01:39:58,924 --> 01:40:00,327
Ow.

1098
01:40:02,027 --> 01:40:03,396
You okay?

1099
01:40:52,412 --> 01:40:55,548
[breathing heavily[

1100
01:42:35,515 --> 01:42:37,650
You birds are crazy.

1101
01:43:08,448 --> 01:43:11,451
- Should I make crepes?
- No.

1102
01:43:11,484 --> 01:43:13,686
Don't you like my crepes?

1103
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:18,858
No, they're fine. They're
just always such a big deal.

1104
01:43:18,892 --> 01:43:21,895
Well, I don't make them
as punishment.

1105
01:43:23,596 --> 01:43:26,499
Oh, this cake is disgusting.

1106
01:43:36,643 --> 01:43:38,611
Do you think they're having sex?

1107
01:43:38,645 --> 01:43:40,045
I do.

1108
01:43:40,078 --> 01:43:42,014
Did you hear something?

1109
01:43:51,056 --> 01:43:52,525
Oh...

1110
01:44:00,667 --> 01:44:02,535
Can you just knock on the door
and give her this?

1111
01:44:02,569 --> 01:44:05,338
- No!
- Come on. Just...

1112
01:44:05,371 --> 01:44:06,506
Henry, come on...

1113
01:44:06,539 --> 01:44:07,540
- No.
- Just...

1114
01:44:07,574 --> 01:44:09,776
Just give the door a little tap.

1115
01:44:12,312 --> 01:44:13,480
Okay.

1116
01:44:17,584 --> 01:44:20,320
- Good morning, sleepyhead.
- <i>Good morning.</i>

1117
01:44:20,353 --> 01:44:23,088
<i>Is Milla awake?</i>

1118
01:44:23,121 --> 01:44:25,658
I didn't hear her in the night.
Did she sleep through?

1119
01:44:25,692 --> 01:44:29,362
<i>She, uh, woke up at about 4:00.</i>

1120
01:44:29,395 --> 01:44:31,997
<i>And then she went to the,
went to the toilet.</i>

1121
01:44:34,199 --> 01:44:36,302
<i>She didn't need her morphine?</i>

1122
01:44:36,336 --> 01:44:38,805
- No.
- <i>That's great.</i>

1123
01:44:38,838 --> 01:44:41,975
That's like the first time
in about six weeks?

1124
01:44:42,007 --> 01:44:44,577
That's, that's great.

1125
01:44:44,611 --> 01:44:47,480
I was going to make you a tray
to have in bed.

1126
01:44:47,514 --> 01:44:49,282
Just gonna finish my cigarette.

1127
01:44:49,315 --> 01:44:52,886
<i>Oh. I thought you could
eat together. Doesn't matter.</i>

1128
01:44:52,919 --> 01:44:56,589
She's got to get up and eat
something in a moment anyway.

1129
01:45:27,219 --> 01:45:28,855
She was dead already.

1130
01:45:30,590 --> 01:45:34,561
You come in here and you...

1131
01:45:34,594 --> 01:45:38,698
And I woke up and she was,
she was already dead.

1132
01:45:38,731 --> 01:45:41,467
She looked peaceful.

1133
01:45:41,501 --> 01:45:43,570
Not now she doesn't.

1134
01:45:43,603 --> 01:45:45,038
She doesn't look so peaceful now

1135
01:45:45,070 --> 01:45:46,873
with her eyes rolled back
like that.

1136
01:45:46,906 --> 01:45:49,976
- I closed them.
- Well, they opened!

1137
01:45:50,009 --> 01:45:53,479
Why didn't you call me?
Why didn't you tell me?

1138
01:45:53,513 --> 01:45:55,213
We could have... We could have...

1139
01:45:55,248 --> 01:45:57,784
We could have...
We could have resuscitated her.

1140
01:45:57,817 --> 01:46:00,687
She might... She might...
maybe she...

1141
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:03,756
She was dead.
She was already dead.

1142
01:46:03,790 --> 01:46:08,126
Will you stop smoking
in my house, you fuck!

1143
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:10,095
You fuck!

1144
01:46:14,467 --> 01:46:16,402
I didn't get to say goodbye.

1145
01:46:24,344 --> 01:46:27,212
She didn't say goodbye to me.

1146
01:46:34,754 --> 01:46:39,124
<i>You come in here
and you smoke us out.</i>

1147
01:46:39,157 --> 01:46:40,627
You!

1148
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:42,528
You're the one
who got to hold her

1149
01:46:42,562 --> 01:46:45,565
you're the one
who got to have her last breath.

1150
01:46:45,598 --> 01:46:49,535
And you use it...
And you use it all up!

1151
01:47:06,886 --> 01:47:09,122
<i>I didn't say goodbye.</i>

1152
01:47:31,944 --> 01:47:35,081
<i>I didn't say goodbye.</i>

1153
01:47:52,699 --> 01:47:56,235
<i>Alright, hey,
are you guys ready?</i>

1154
01:47:56,269 --> 01:47:57,270
<i>Ready?</i>

1155
01:47:59,739 --> 01:48:02,875
<i>Ah, ready?</i>

1156
01:48:05,778 --> 01:48:08,181
<i>One, two...</i>

1157
01:48:11,517 --> 01:48:12,919
Sorry.

1158
01:48:12,952 --> 01:48:14,687
- What did you do?
- Sorry.

1159
01:48:14,721 --> 01:48:16,723
I accidentally went like this.

1160
01:48:19,926 --> 01:48:21,661
<i>Okay, you ready?</i>

1161
01:48:21,694 --> 01:48:24,163
Isaac!
Isaac, come and be in the photo.

1162
01:48:29,936 --> 01:48:31,003
Sit in the middle.
Middle.

1163
01:48:31,037 --> 01:48:32,739
- Middle.
- Oh, Jesus.

1164
01:48:32,772 --> 01:48:34,574
Seriously, mum's got a bit of
hypervigilance

1165
01:48:34,607 --> 01:48:36,008
about the beach, mate.

1166
01:48:36,042 --> 01:48:37,009
Go.

1167
01:48:37,643 --> 01:48:39,011
<i>You all ready?</i>

1168
01:48:41,514 --> 01:48:43,883
Got it. Got it.

1169
01:48:45,485 --> 01:48:47,987
Come here, mate.

1170
01:48:48,020 --> 01:48:49,255
- No.
- You're coming with me!

1171
01:48:49,288 --> 01:48:51,224
What're you doing?
What're you doing?

1172
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:54,861
- How is it?
- No, no, no. Stop.

1173
01:48:54,894 --> 01:48:56,362
Stop, stop, stop.

1174
01:48:57,530 --> 01:48:59,198
Here we go. Oh, my God!

1175
01:49:27,026 --> 01:49:30,897
Oh, yeah, I got this idea.
Okay. Okay.

1176
01:49:30,930 --> 01:49:33,399
This is good. Mill? You ready?

1177
01:49:35,468 --> 01:49:37,403
I'm tired, Henry.

1178
01:49:42,608 --> 01:49:45,444
Darling, I know,
but, but you can just...

1179
01:49:45,478 --> 01:49:46,612
<i>Dad.</i>

1180
01:49:47,814 --> 01:49:49,649
I'm tired.

1181
01:49:57,757 --> 01:49:59,325
You know we'll be okay.

1182
01:50:06,866 --> 01:50:08,302
I'll take your photo.

1183
01:50:10,736 --> 01:50:12,338
- No, no...
- Go.

1184
01:50:12,371 --> 01:50:14,006
- Go and stand over there.
- No, dear, it's okay.

1185
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:16,175
- I want to do it.
- Alright.

1186
01:50:16,209 --> 01:50:19,045
<i>Well, do you know
that t... to do the focus</i>

1187
01:50:19,078 --> 01:50:22,615
<i>you do, the, um, the outside
wheel and for the finer points</i>

1188
01:50:22,648 --> 01:50:26,552
<i>that will be the fine focus,
and then obviously that's the shutter.</i>

1189
01:50:26,586 --> 01:50:28,588
I know how to use it, dad.

1190
01:50:28,621 --> 01:50:31,123
Yeah, okay. But just y... you
might want to wait 'til...

1191
01:50:31,157 --> 01:50:33,125
Will you look after Moses, dad?

1192
01:50:35,528 --> 01:50:36,762
Yeah.

1193
01:50:43,369 --> 01:50:45,004
Are you going to smile?

1194
01:50:45,037 --> 01:50:47,440
Um, just give me a minute.

1195
01:51:11,097 --> 01:51:14,467
I'm going to enjoy becoming
part of a sky like this, dad.

1196
01:51:24,378 --> 01:51:26,846
Hey? You okay?

1197
01:51:33,753 --> 01:51:35,221
Are you ready?

1198
01:51:37,490 --> 01:51:38,791
Yep.

1199
01:51:39,825 --> 01:51:41,060
Yep.

1200
01:51:42,929 --> 01:51:47,066
One, two, three.

2
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:57,710
Lake Jindabyne filled in the 1970s...

3
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:01,908
No, it wouldn't be as dry
as what it was last year.

4
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,891
She's off to the races

5
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,011
She's walking on air

6
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:59,288
She's trying on dresses

7
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:04,053
And brushing her hair

8
00:03:13,658 --> 00:03:17,730
Now she makes an appearance

9
00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:21,095
At the top of the stairs

10
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:27,013
She's off to the races

11
00:03:27,615 --> 00:03:30,288
At the Jindabyne Fair

12
00:03:37,615 --> 00:03:41,926
Her eyes tell a story

13
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:45,087
She's been dreaming all year

14
00:03:49,534 --> 00:03:52,411
She walks like a duchess...

15
00:04:01,652 --> 00:04:03,882
Something under your car!

16
00:04:16,771 --> 00:04:19,285
Pull over! Something under your car!

17
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:20,770
Something underneath!

18
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:22,643
Something under your car!

19
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:28,318
Come on, stop, you fucking bitch!

20
00:05:16,445 --> 00:05:19,005
It all comes down from the power station.

21
00:05:19,405 --> 00:05:20,724
Electricity.

22
00:06:27,998 --> 00:06:29,636
Who's my main man?

23
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:32,147
Okay.

24
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:34,987
Come on, tiger, let's go.
There's fish awaiting.

25
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,351
Come on.

26
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:39,104
Put your shoes on.

27
00:07:34,031 --> 00:07:35,259
That's it, pull.

28
00:07:36,311 --> 00:07:37,346
Pull.

29
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:40,385
- Can you feel it?
- Yeah, it's heavy!

30
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:42,307
Yeah, do you want me to help you?

31
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,784
- I can do it!
- You can do it? Okay.

32
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:48,663
Oh, man! It's so exciting.
Look, it's coming. It's...

33
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:51,819
Wow! That's a funny-looking fish.

34
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:54,747
- It's a piece of junk.
- It's a clock-fish.

35
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:58,777
- I wonder who that belonged to. Still going.
- What do you mean?

36
00:07:58,988 --> 00:08:02,105
- Is it still going?
- Yeah, it is.

37
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:05,618
Out there, underneath that water,
is the town

38
00:08:05,748 --> 00:08:08,307
where all the old men sit in rocking chairs.

39
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:11,218
There's houses and shops.

40
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:13,221
But you know what? There was a night

41
00:08:13,347 --> 00:08:15,656
when I was out here
and it was really dark and stormy,

42
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,664
and I heard this noise...

43
00:08:20,706 --> 00:08:23,823
And it was a bell coming from
under the water

44
00:08:23,946 --> 00:08:26,141
because the old church is still down there.

45
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:30,179
And sometimes, when the water's really low,
you can see the tip of the spire.

46
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,458
- I think I can see it now.
- Can you see it now?

47
00:08:34,585 --> 00:08:37,338
- Can you hear the bell?
- I can a little bit.

48
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,745
When can I come fishing with you for real?

49
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:43,742
When you learn to swim.
I told you that before.

50
00:08:44,104 --> 00:08:45,981
- See that mountain over there?
- Yeah.

51
00:08:46,104 --> 00:08:49,493
I'm going to take you to a river
that's on the other side of that mountain.

52
00:08:49,623 --> 00:08:51,261
And we'll fish there.

53
00:09:17,301 --> 00:09:18,779
- Jude.
- What?

54
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,413
Jude, she's not in her bedroom.

55
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,778
Caylin-Calandria!

56
00:09:41,978 --> 00:09:43,331
What are you doing with this?

57
00:09:45,138 --> 00:09:48,255
What are you up to now, Caylin-Calandria?

58
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:53,131
- How long have you been out here?
- Caylin-Calandria!

59
00:10:15,175 --> 00:10:18,450
Mom, Mom, Mom,
I caught an Atlantic salmon.

60
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:21,452
- Dad says I can cook it myself.
- No, no way. Just...

61
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,929
Go jump in the shower,
I'll make you some toast.

62
00:10:24,054 --> 00:10:26,363
- Please.
- Go on, do as you're told.

63
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:29,282
What's wrong?

64
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:30,926
I don't want to deal with fried food
this morning.

65
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:40,002
I didn't have the heart to tell him
to throw it back in again.

66
00:10:41,212 --> 00:10:42,964
He seemed to be so proud of it.

67
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,081
You know the way it is.

68
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:56,081
- Hi.
- Hi.

69
00:10:56,891 --> 00:10:58,164
- Hi, Tom.
- Hi.

70
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,564
In you go.

71
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:06,567
Seat belt, please.

72
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:10,119
- Bye, Nan.
- See you later.

73
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,521
Can I see yours?

74
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:23,646
Excited about the weekend?

75
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:26,680
- Yeah, it'll be great.
- Yeah, it'll be great.

76
00:11:26,807 --> 00:11:28,604
Looking forward to it.

77
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,405
- Sorry to barge in so early.
- No worries.

78
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:54,759
I shouldn't be eating this crap.

79
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:58,518
Just clench your fist for me a few times.

80
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,240
All right.

81
00:12:00,725 --> 00:12:02,794
Let's see if you are pregnant
before we start panicking.

82
00:12:02,924 --> 00:12:04,879
I must be. I never get sick.

83
00:12:05,003 --> 00:12:07,312
Claire, stop imagining the worst.

84
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:13,592
Stewey was telling me
it's the big fish-a-thon this weekend.

85
00:12:13,762 --> 00:12:16,834
Now Peggy's been nagging me
to take her fishing, you know.

86
00:12:17,122 --> 00:12:19,795
Last weekend, I took her up to Myall Lakes
for the evening rows.

87
00:12:19,922 --> 00:12:21,674
What if it happens again?

88
00:12:21,802 --> 00:12:22,871
It won't.

89
00:12:23,002 --> 00:12:25,390
Besides, this time we're prepared.

90
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,511
I'm so looking forward to some time out.

91
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,551
If I hear one more word about fishing...

92
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,070
Only three more deliveries,
but they're all out on the plain.

93
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,153
Why don't you invite me over
for a home-cooked meal

94
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,394
while Stewey's away?

95
00:12:54,999 --> 00:12:56,990
Let me consider your generous offer
and get back to you.

96
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:58,594
No.

97
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,062
You're way too close to the ground
back here.

98
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,668
You're gonna bash him on the ground.

99
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:26,220
You're breaking your wrist open.

100
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:28,465
Just keep it hard up
against your wrist there.

101
00:14:31,109 --> 00:14:32,827
- Hey, Rocco.
- Morning.

102
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:34,785
- Hey, Billy.
- Morning.

103
00:14:35,468 --> 00:14:38,380
Very flash. Thought you were broke.

104
00:14:38,508 --> 00:14:39,657
I am.

105
00:14:39,788 --> 00:14:41,062
Beautiful.

106
00:14:42,668 --> 00:14:44,465
- Fast action.
- Very.

107
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:47,386
- Can't wait to get to that river.
- Some of us have work to do.

108
00:14:49,787 --> 00:14:52,620
- Well, don't worry about that, miss I'll do it.
- Thank you.

109
00:14:52,747 --> 00:14:55,500
- There you are. How are you going?
- Good, thank you.

110
00:15:33,782 --> 00:15:37,138
It's time to say goodbye to Jindabyne

111
00:15:38,262 --> 00:15:42,301
It's been my home these 50 years of time

112
00:15:42,462 --> 00:15:45,134
Now the longfins in their winter snow

113
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:47,491
and the Snowy River down below

114
00:15:47,621 --> 00:15:50,340
Is whispering farewell to Jindabyne

115
00:15:50,461 --> 00:15:53,419
In the southeastern corner
of New South Wales,

116
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,930
the old town of Jindabyne
was an historic landmark.

117
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,850
With the inception of the Snowy scheme,

118
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,938
the town was moved
to a position on higher land

119
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,778
to make way for the rising waters

120
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,369
backed up by the dam
constructed in the valley.

121
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:11,730
One of the older residents
of the township is Mr Tom Weston.

122
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:16,728
I was born in Jindabyne, you know.
But I come to Beranghi for a while.

123
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:19,770
- And then me father shipped me to Lismore.
- I see.

124
00:16:19,898 --> 00:16:22,935
Mrs Rankin, how do you feel
about leaving the old town?

125
00:16:23,058 --> 00:16:26,936
Oh, well, there's sentimental reasons,
of course, why you feel a bit sad.

126
00:16:27,057 --> 00:16:30,288
But when you get better conditions,
you think to yourself, "I'm better off."

127
00:16:31,177 --> 00:16:34,486
Finally, on the 19th of December, 1964...

128
00:16:35,696 --> 00:16:36,890
Lunch.

129
00:16:41,736 --> 00:16:43,691
Go on. I won't tell Claire.

130
00:16:47,975 --> 00:16:50,648
I fished it out this morning
from the drowned town.

131
00:16:50,775 --> 00:16:52,094
I've been there.

132
00:16:52,215 --> 00:16:54,808
- I've been there, too.
- Not all the way.

133
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:57,928
My dad says there's old men down there.

134
00:16:58,054 --> 00:16:59,373
I know.

135
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:02,691
Zombies. When you drown, they get you.

136
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,884
You have to be their slave.

137
00:17:05,094 --> 00:17:07,129
I touched one once. It licked my foot.

138
00:17:08,213 --> 00:17:10,249
Its tongue was green slime.

139
00:17:10,853 --> 00:17:11,808
Poison.

140
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:13,844
But I kicked him in the head and got away.

141
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:21,442
Come on. Don't be a baby.

142
00:17:22,772 --> 00:17:24,763
And don't forget the knife.

143
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,642
- He won't swallow it.
- You're hurting him.

144
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,125
We can't offer him up if he's awake!

145
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:47,725
If you want my opinion,
it smells like air freshener.

146
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:51,806
You are truly a horrible man.

147
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:56,884
Phone Carmel.
There's been an incident at the school.

148
00:18:02,568 --> 00:18:05,525
- Tom could be expelled for bringing a knife.
- I made him.

149
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:07,126
What on earth were you
going to do with that?

150
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:08,202
It's private.

151
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:10,841
Private!
I'll give you private, you're seven years old.

152
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:12,559
Kids, this is very serious.

153
00:18:12,687 --> 00:18:15,155
You know what? If Tom's expelled,
I'm sending you to the orphanage.

154
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:16,515
Excellent.

155
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,600
None of the other kids saw them.
I might be able to contain this.

156
00:18:25,446 --> 00:18:29,597
Contain what?
We're talking about a dead rodent.

157
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:32,637
We're talking about the class pet.
They were supposed to be taking care of it.

158
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:34,835
Look, Jude, we're talking about a knife
and we're talking about drugs.

159
00:18:34,965 --> 00:18:36,636
I can't believe Tom brought a weapon
to school.

160
00:18:36,764 --> 00:18:38,038
Carmel, I'm so sorry.

161
00:18:38,164 --> 00:18:41,235
Claire, this is not a weapon,
it's a fishing knife.

162
00:18:42,043 --> 00:18:44,841
And anyway, we all know
it's not Tom's doing.

163
00:18:45,523 --> 00:18:48,037
Have you considered
grief counselling for Caylin-Calandria?

164
00:18:48,163 --> 00:18:52,201
It might help you and Carl as well.
You know, you can go as a family.

165
00:18:53,322 --> 00:18:56,473
I do not need to get some advice
from some stranger.

166
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:05,434
We'll buy a new guinea pig tomorrow.

167
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,199
We can't tomorrow.
I'm going to visit Nana.

168
00:19:07,321 --> 00:19:09,039
No, you're not. You're grounded.

169
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:11,752
- Can I be grounded at Tom's house?
- No.

170
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:13,633
Yes. It's fine.

171
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:17,150
Claire, I wouldn't do it to you.
Not for the whole weekend.

172
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,511
We'll ground them in shifts.
Go on, go get your stuff.

173
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,553
- She's getting worse.
- Just give her time.

174
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,830
Time! Show me where you buy some of that.

175
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:30,957
Your granddaughter's just done
her first murder!

176
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:34,193
Toilet's blocked again.

177
00:19:49,997 --> 00:19:53,193
Vanessa! Vanessa! Vanessa!
Guess what! Guess what! We're grounded.

178
00:19:53,316 --> 00:19:55,591
- Grounded!
- Gosh! What's that mean?

179
00:19:58,436 --> 00:19:59,869
You're early.

180
00:20:17,154 --> 00:20:19,668
Claire, I don't approve
of women and children

181
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:21,910
being housebound this weekend.

182
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,668
Well, I'm sorry about that,
but Tom has to take responsibility

183
00:20:24,794 --> 00:20:25,782
for his choices.

184
00:20:25,913 --> 00:20:27,904
Surely he's got another 50 years
to learn that.

185
00:20:31,473 --> 00:20:33,589
Where are the decent glasses?

186
00:20:34,313 --> 00:20:35,348
Packed away.

187
00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:38,669
What's the point of that?
Things are made to be used.

188
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,825
I found that down the back of the cupboard.

189
00:20:43,552 --> 00:20:46,305
You don't have to like it,
you just have to live with it. I did.

190
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,424
- You still smell of petrol.
- Nice hair.

191
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,385
Thanks.

192
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,903
Guess what? Siobhan's left her husband.

193
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,589
A repeat performance. No word. No note.

194
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:03,825
No point, according to her.

195
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:08,745
- So you see, it wasn't just you.
- I'm not interested, Mom.

196
00:21:08,989 --> 00:21:12,458
Don't be silly, we all love hearing gossip
about people we hate.

197
00:21:12,588 --> 00:21:14,544
I don't know why you even
keep in touch with her.

198
00:21:15,868 --> 00:21:19,383
I invested time and energy
in that marriage as well as you.

199
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:23,423
And she's always been good to me.

200
00:21:23,788 --> 00:21:25,823
Tom took a knife to school.

201
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:30,865
- Well, at least he knows how to handle it.
- Claire, you're overreacting.

202
00:21:30,987 --> 00:21:34,059
- This isn't open for discussion.
- Of course it is.

203
00:21:34,347 --> 00:21:37,179
- You guys sort it out.
- It is sorted.

204
00:21:40,306 --> 00:21:41,580
Sorted.

205
00:21:45,786 --> 00:21:49,221
That hair makes you look like
the kind of man who visits prostitutes.

206
00:22:06,983 --> 00:22:09,258
Do you think she'll come tonight?

207
00:22:10,543 --> 00:22:12,931
She mostly comes when I'm by myself.

208
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:24,647
Elissa, he's going away a boy,
but he's going to come back a man.

209
00:23:24,775 --> 00:23:27,369
No, thanks, I want him back
just the way he is.

210
00:23:27,495 --> 00:23:29,804
Well, don't let him loose
with this bunch of maniacs.

211
00:23:32,015 --> 00:23:34,403
Hey, come on. You'll wake the baby.

212
00:23:34,694 --> 00:23:35,683
Geez.

213
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:39,011
- Carl. Carl, take it easy.
- Don't you worry about me.

214
00:23:39,374 --> 00:23:42,730
- We need you fit for tomorrow.
- What's this...

215
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:45,845
- What? What's what?
- There's something different about you.

216
00:23:45,973 --> 00:23:48,851
- I think he looks very dashing.
- I can't wait. I wish we could go tonight.

217
00:23:48,973 --> 00:23:50,645
The word is dashing.

218
00:23:51,213 --> 00:23:53,249
Elissa, Billy told me that

219
00:23:53,373 --> 00:23:56,012
you've surfed almost
everywhere in the world.

220
00:23:56,253 --> 00:23:57,810
- Is that true?
- Pretty much.

221
00:23:57,932 --> 00:23:59,809
Best place in the world right here, all right.

222
00:23:59,932 --> 00:24:03,004
Actually, I don't like being this far inland.
There's no water.

223
00:24:03,132 --> 00:24:05,247
We got more water
than bloody Sydney Harbour!

224
00:24:05,371 --> 00:24:08,601
There's no waves, though.
You can't surf without a wave.

225
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:15,598
- In a hidden valley...
- Here we go! Here we go! He's off.

226
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,369
...lies a hidden river.
- Full of blarney.

227
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,407
There dwells a fish

228
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,761
wild and cunning.

229
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,320
A mysterious,

230
00:24:26,649 --> 00:24:27,968
wild...

231
00:24:29,489 --> 00:24:30,638
Elusive.

232
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:34,127
Stay with it, baby. Stay with it. Keep going.

233
00:24:34,248 --> 00:24:36,523
Mysterious, wild fish.

234
00:24:36,648 --> 00:24:39,799
Fuck. Hurry up, will you?
My arm's falling off.

235
00:24:39,928 --> 00:24:42,488
- Immemorial.
- Age immemorial.

236
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:44,837
Don't expect me to cook it then.

237
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:48,118
- As time lies waiting.
- As we are all doing.

238
00:24:48,967 --> 00:24:50,400
Okay, shut up!

239
00:24:50,527 --> 00:24:52,836
Waiting for us.

240
00:24:52,967 --> 00:24:55,434
I knew this speech last year.
Anyway,

241
00:24:56,206 --> 00:24:59,039
- to the Wild One!
- To the Wild One!

242
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,236
- Cheers.
- The Wild One!

243
00:25:04,246 --> 00:25:05,599
Here we go.

244
00:25:05,886 --> 00:25:08,558
Thank Christ he can fish better
than he can talk.

245
00:25:17,844 --> 00:25:21,677
- What's she done now?
- Nothing. She's an angel.

246
00:25:21,803 --> 00:25:23,031
They both are.

247
00:25:23,163 --> 00:25:26,075
We had a powwow,
and we decided we deserve a treat, too.

248
00:25:26,723 --> 00:25:30,476
- Don't panic. We're not gate-crashing.
- No. No, you're not, Mom.

249
00:25:30,642 --> 00:25:33,600
Please, sit down. Sit down.
Sit down. Sit down.

250
00:25:33,722 --> 00:25:35,872
Well, if you're sure we're not in the way.

251
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:38,038
No, not at all.

252
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,596
We can build a little crèche
down the end of the table for you.

253
00:25:40,722 --> 00:25:43,030
- You can sit on the end.
- I'll sit here.

254
00:25:43,161 --> 00:25:45,880
We grannies must stick together.

255
00:25:50,881 --> 00:25:52,712
I hear you put the frighteners
on a guinea pig today.

256
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,916
All right, let's go.

257
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,593
Claire, sit down.

258
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,235
The children are grounded.

259
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,920
Yeah, I know, but it's the one night,
and we're...

260
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,193
Please, sit down.

261
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:07,748
Don't spoil it, Claire.

262
00:26:17,277 --> 00:26:18,505
Sorry.

263
00:26:22,237 --> 00:26:25,434
All right, gentlemen. Come on, on your feet.
It's that time of year again.

264
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:29,271
Get down. Just the beautiful ones.

265
00:26:31,236 --> 00:26:35,115
- Come on, snuggle up!
- You're bloody big for a hooker, aren't you?

266
00:26:35,236 --> 00:26:36,589
All right, look like you're having
a good time.

267
00:26:37,156 --> 00:26:39,033
Carl, you look the best.

268
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,433
Again you coughed. Come on, one more!

269
00:26:43,795 --> 00:26:45,387
- Beautiful.
- Oh, I was...

270
00:26:45,555 --> 00:26:47,671
Oh, it's all right. Don't worry. Wombat!

271
00:26:47,795 --> 00:26:49,433
Oh, all right. One more.

272
00:26:49,555 --> 00:26:51,432
- Wombat.
- Got it.

273
00:26:59,914 --> 00:27:02,951
- What time do you call this?
- I call this morning.

274
00:27:03,194 --> 00:27:05,548
Here. Come on, we have to leave.

275
00:27:06,193 --> 00:27:09,185
- Relax. We're on bloody holiday.
- Okay.

276
00:27:11,313 --> 00:27:14,191
No, I'm still here. Me, too.

277
00:27:14,553 --> 00:27:15,905
For fuck's sake!

278
00:27:16,192 --> 00:27:19,070
It's okay, man, I'll do it. I'll do it.
Got to go.

279
00:27:19,552 --> 00:27:21,587
All right. Bye, bye.

280
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:32,747
Hey, Billy, put the sign around
the right way, you dope!

281
00:27:52,868 --> 00:27:54,699
Hey, listen, try to avoid the potholes,
will you?

282
00:27:55,348 --> 00:27:56,622
My brain's hanging by a thread.

283
00:27:56,748 --> 00:27:58,864
- What brain?
- I don't know.

284
00:28:01,028 --> 00:28:02,506
I'm never drinking again.

285
00:28:06,547 --> 00:28:07,946
Hi, Elissa!

286
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:09,456
Hello.

287
00:28:10,187 --> 00:28:11,461
Oh, really.

288
00:28:12,947 --> 00:28:14,299
Okay.

289
00:28:14,506 --> 00:28:17,020
Bye. She loves me.

290
00:28:17,466 --> 00:28:19,297
- Love-struck.
- Hen-pecked.

291
00:28:19,546 --> 00:28:20,774
Thin line.

292
00:28:22,186 --> 00:28:23,824
Too bloody right.

293
00:28:54,622 --> 00:28:55,941
Are you sick?

294
00:28:56,782 --> 00:28:59,137
No, I just ate too much last night.

295
00:28:59,902 --> 00:29:01,334
No, you didn't.

296
00:29:10,981 --> 00:29:13,938
When my mom was sick,
she spewed up green slime.

297
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,493
It was gross.

298
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,018
It wasn't her fault.

299
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,855
She couldn't help it. It was bile.

300
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,811
Everyone has that in their tummy. It's not...

301
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,289
It's not gross. It's natural.

302
00:29:33,058 --> 00:29:34,377
Are you going to die?

303
00:29:35,778 --> 00:29:38,928
No, my love. No one's going to die.

304
00:29:41,057 --> 00:29:42,775
You're stuck with me.

305
00:30:17,014 --> 00:30:19,528
Before I go,
there's something I'd like to say.

306
00:30:19,654 --> 00:30:21,485
No, there's something I'd like to say to you.

307
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:24,125
You have no authority over my family.

308
00:30:25,013 --> 00:30:26,890
Not any more. It's time you accepted that.

309
00:30:28,413 --> 00:30:31,405
You sound very wound up.
You need to be careful.

310
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:32,852
I'm fine.

311
00:30:35,572 --> 00:30:37,563
They're my boys, too, Claire.

312
00:30:37,692 --> 00:30:41,570
I didn't come to this godforsaken country
to make a nuisance of myself.

313
00:30:41,691 --> 00:30:43,249
I came because they needed me.

314
00:30:43,371 --> 00:30:46,521
I know that and I'm grateful. We all are.

315
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,366
But that's in the past now.

316
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,398
It's not me that's ridden by the past.

317
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:57,324
I know you're accustomed
to doing without a mother,

318
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,280
but I'd just like to say

319
00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:03,998
you're like a daughter to me now.
Must you always fight it?

320
00:31:40,406 --> 00:31:41,600
Oh, man!

321
00:31:55,124 --> 00:31:58,798
- I'm not getting any reception.
- You won't get any reception up here, mate.

322
00:32:00,283 --> 00:32:01,955
Not getting anything.

323
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,041
Watch out for snakes, Billy.

324
00:32:17,482 --> 00:32:18,437
Seriously?

325
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,338
God!

326
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,422
Listen to that.

327
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:21,018
Sorry?

328
00:34:30,188 --> 00:34:31,541
Bloody typical.

329
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:33,977
Jude forgot to pack my sandwiches.

330
00:34:34,548 --> 00:34:36,425
Do you want some of this?

331
00:34:39,868 --> 00:34:42,097
It's protein. It's good for you.

332
00:34:54,866 --> 00:34:58,541
- Three beautiful women walk into a bar...
- It's always three beautiful women with you.

333
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:00,258
Now, just listen. Listen.

334
00:35:00,386 --> 00:35:02,740
Blonde, brunette and a lesbian, see,
and the barmaid says...

335
00:35:02,865 --> 00:35:05,253
What colour hair has the lesbian got?

336
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:09,022
How the fuck do I know? Blue.
Anyway, the barmaid comes...

337
00:35:09,144 --> 00:35:11,135
Elissa used to be a lesbian.

338
00:35:14,744 --> 00:35:15,699
Idiot.

339
00:35:18,023 --> 00:35:19,775
Well, she's not any more.

340
00:35:28,462 --> 00:35:30,771
Anyway, the lesbian says...

341
00:35:48,901 --> 00:35:51,698
- You're out of condition, old man.
- No, I'm not.

342
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,492
Someone just moved the river, that's all.

343
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:25,693
- I have to show this place to Elissa.
- No, no, no.

344
00:36:27,096 --> 00:36:28,654
No women allowed.

345
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,400
Oh, Jesus. Jesus.

346
00:38:15,766 --> 00:38:17,960
Oh, Jesus.

347
00:38:34,564 --> 00:38:37,555
Oh, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. Jesus.

348
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:42,078
Jesus. Carl!

349
00:38:43,283 --> 00:38:45,239
Carl! Come here!

350
00:38:57,882 --> 00:38:58,870
Oh, fuck.

351
00:38:59,001 --> 00:38:59,956
Oh, Jesus.

352
00:39:01,561 --> 00:39:02,676
Carl!

353
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:05,875
Rocco, for fuck's sake, come here!

354
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,919
Where the fuck are you?

355
00:39:40,557 --> 00:39:41,546
Take her!

356
00:39:41,677 --> 00:39:43,110
Take her!

357
00:39:43,237 --> 00:39:46,069
Take her, for fuck's sake! Take her!

358
00:40:02,315 --> 00:40:03,270
Oh, fuck!

359
00:40:14,474 --> 00:40:16,544
- Fuck this!
- Where are you going?

360
00:40:17,274 --> 00:40:19,504
Billy, no, no, no. Billy, no!

361
00:40:36,271 --> 00:40:37,989
I propose that we leave her here.

362
00:40:39,031 --> 00:40:41,181
If she gets carried downstream,
she'll go down to the rapids

363
00:40:41,311 --> 00:40:42,460
and we'll never find her.

364
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,505
Yeah.

365
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,830
No, I agree with that. We should tie her up
in the water. It's freezing.

366
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:53,101
If you put her out in the sun,
she'd be gone, history.

367
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,979
I don't think we should
ever have touched her.

368
00:40:56,109 --> 00:40:58,577
I mean, it's a crime scene.
And we've disturbed it.

369
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:00,859
Billy, for fuck's sake, shut up!

370
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:42,054
My plants! I have to save my plants!

371
00:41:48,024 --> 00:41:49,173
Zombie!

372
00:41:55,623 --> 00:41:58,615
So what the hell am I going to do with her?
I'm losing her, too.

373
00:41:58,743 --> 00:42:01,211
- No, you're not.
- I am. I can feel it.

374
00:42:03,183 --> 00:42:04,172
Hi!

375
00:42:04,543 --> 00:42:07,261
- I invited Carmel.
- Why?

376
00:42:07,382 --> 00:42:10,931
She's Rocco's girlfriend.
We should make her feel comfortable.

377
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:13,018
- Jude.
- Okay. Okay.

378
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:20,851
- Hi, Ms D.
- Have you done your homework? Joking.

379
00:42:21,301 --> 00:42:23,735
Look! Look!

380
00:42:25,341 --> 00:42:27,013
- Oh, wow!
- Did you see the cake?

381
00:42:27,141 --> 00:42:30,212
I had big weekend plans. Three DVDs,
the express issue of Vanity Fair,

382
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,217
- and all I've done is sleep.
- Half your luck.

383
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,217
- Mind if I open a window?
- Of course not.

384
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:38,899
It's a shame we have to baby-sit.
I was all geared up for a good dance.

385
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,009
The pub is packed and jumping.

386
00:42:41,138 --> 00:42:42,651
- Can I have a glass, please?
- Yes.

387
00:42:43,738 --> 00:42:45,854
God, I love dancing. The Bee Gees.

388
00:42:47,738 --> 00:42:49,376
- But what?
- The Bee Gees?

389
00:42:49,498 --> 00:42:52,137
- Yeah.
- You can't be that old!

390
00:42:54,817 --> 00:42:55,966
Hello.

391
00:42:58,297 --> 00:43:00,572
Is that homemade?

392
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:03,852
Whoa! Homemade.

393
00:43:03,977 --> 00:43:05,170
Can I try?

394
00:43:05,296 --> 00:43:06,615
Yeah, I'll make sure
you get the biggest piece.

395
00:43:06,736 --> 00:43:07,691
Now leave it.

396
00:43:09,536 --> 00:43:10,935
Go on, scoot!

397
00:43:11,536 --> 00:43:14,175
- But...
- You'll get one later. I promise.

398
00:43:15,536 --> 00:43:17,093
She's a handful.

399
00:43:18,615 --> 00:43:21,607
She's her own person.
Just like her mother was.

400
00:43:25,095 --> 00:43:28,609
- Never wanted any of your own?
- Haven't found the perfect man yet.

401
00:43:28,734 --> 00:43:29,723
You're kidding!

402
00:43:30,054 --> 00:43:31,726
Women in this town would queue up
for Rocco.

403
00:43:32,414 --> 00:43:33,733
So I gather.

404
00:43:35,094 --> 00:43:37,483
Actually, I'm starting to wonder
if I can even have kids.

405
00:43:38,654 --> 00:43:41,326
But, hey, maybe Rocco has the mighty seed.

406
00:43:45,173 --> 00:43:48,289
- Rocco was going to be my son-in-law.
- Really?

407
00:43:50,372 --> 00:43:51,884
Once upon a time.

408
00:43:54,691 --> 00:43:57,000
So what about you, Claire?
You obviously love children.

409
00:43:58,651 --> 00:44:00,050
Stewart wouldn't want any more.

410
00:44:01,011 --> 00:44:02,921
Well, who could blame him?

411
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:08,405
- Have I said something that I shouldn't...
- Of course not.

412
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:11,929
I wasn't well after Tom was born.

413
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,802
I couldn't look after him,
so it was hard on Stewart.

414
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:16,604
It must have been hard for you, too.

415
00:44:16,729 --> 00:44:18,242
Claire took off.

416
00:44:19,769 --> 00:44:21,964
- I went to stay with my sister.
- For 18 months.

417
00:44:22,089 --> 00:44:23,966
- You know what...
- So, yeah, it was hard on Stewey.

418
00:44:24,089 --> 00:44:25,841
I've stopped expecting anybody
to understand.

419
00:44:28,008 --> 00:44:31,887
You two should count your blessings.
You're young, you're healthy.

420
00:44:32,008 --> 00:44:34,124
Your family's still in one piece.

421
00:44:34,248 --> 00:44:38,365
People dying in the wrong order,
that's pretty much when it all turns to shit!

422
00:44:38,487 --> 00:44:41,320
- Come on! We're off!
- But the movie!

423
00:44:43,887 --> 00:44:47,277
Come on, Mom. Let's get you back
to the veggie patch. Come on.

424
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:48,716
Come on.

425
00:44:48,847 --> 00:44:51,405
Jude. Jude, put her down.

426
00:44:51,645 --> 00:44:53,954
- Come on. Put her down, put her down.
- You're not going anywhere.

427
00:44:54,085 --> 00:44:55,598
Come on. Come on.

428
00:44:56,925 --> 00:44:58,438
You all right?

429
00:45:00,445 --> 00:45:02,560
I'm sorry. I'm just so tired.

430
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:09,360
What's wrong
with the fucking Bee Gees anyway?

431
00:45:09,484 --> 00:45:10,439
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

432
00:45:10,564 --> 00:45:13,124
There's nothing wrong with the Bee Gees.

433
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:14,676
Piss off!

434
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:16,919
We love the Bee Gees.

435
00:45:17,643 --> 00:45:20,032
The greatest musical artists ever.

436
00:45:21,203 --> 00:45:22,602
We love them.

437
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:35,189
Okay, look. See that rise over there?

438
00:47:35,669 --> 00:47:38,706
Okay, you're going to reel him in.
Now set it up.

439
00:47:40,949 --> 00:47:43,509
Fantastic. Okay. Now take your time.

440
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,501
Play him in.

441
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,262
That's it.

442
00:47:47,548 --> 00:47:48,901
Okay, now!

443
00:47:50,788 --> 00:47:53,905
That's it. Let him fight. Let him fight.
Let him fight.

444
00:47:54,028 --> 00:47:56,542
Come on. You got him. You've got him.
You got him.

445
00:47:57,227 --> 00:47:58,501
That's it.

446
00:47:59,907 --> 00:48:01,022
Yes!

447
00:48:47,542 --> 00:48:50,010
- Could have scooped him up with one hand.
- Sure you could.

448
00:48:51,702 --> 00:48:55,853
- Which one's dinner?
- Not mine. Mine's coming home with me.

449
00:48:57,181 --> 00:49:00,218
- All right. Hold it up. I'll get a photograph.
- Hang on.

450
00:49:02,741 --> 00:49:04,652
Trout with stunned mullet.

451
00:49:05,181 --> 00:49:06,739
Okay. Hold it up.

452
00:49:20,018 --> 00:49:21,497
Can't wait to get back to that river.

453
00:49:23,898 --> 00:49:25,570
I can. I'm rooted.

454
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:29,130
I feel really trippy.

455
00:49:30,858 --> 00:49:32,210
Too much sun.

456
00:49:34,177 --> 00:49:36,771
I've never known anything like it.

457
00:49:37,937 --> 00:49:40,007
Something's put the river spirits
in a good mood.

458
00:49:53,976 --> 00:49:57,445
Look, I don't care what you guys do,
but I'm gonna leave tomorrow morning.

459
00:52:00,243 --> 00:52:02,393
Hey, how are you?

460
00:52:03,322 --> 00:52:04,516
I'm okay.

461
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:07,160
We found a body.

462
00:52:09,922 --> 00:52:12,390
I caught the most amazing fish, though.

463
00:52:13,882 --> 00:52:14,996
What?

464
00:52:17,481 --> 00:52:18,470
Yeah.

465
00:52:18,601 --> 00:52:19,875
No problem.

466
00:52:20,521 --> 00:52:21,954
Yeah. Goodbye.

467
00:52:22,281 --> 00:52:23,270
Fuck.

468
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:37,397
- Cops want us to stay here.
- What'd they say?

469
00:52:37,799 --> 00:52:39,914
Nothing. What would they say?

470
00:52:40,598 --> 00:52:43,237
Well, the lesbian told Billy
not to bother bringing his fish home.

471
00:52:44,198 --> 00:52:45,756
We got to get this story straight.

472
00:53:03,396 --> 00:53:05,546
Let's just go under together, okay?

473
00:53:05,676 --> 00:53:09,589
All right? You ready? Hang on.
I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere.

474
00:53:09,716 --> 00:53:11,991
We go under on three. All right?

475
00:53:12,116 --> 00:53:15,346
One... Hold your breath.
Two, three. Here we go.

476
00:53:18,875 --> 00:53:20,228
Good boy.

477
00:53:21,315 --> 00:53:24,387
Oh, that was so good, though!
You don't want to it again, do you?

478
00:53:24,515 --> 00:53:27,028
- No.
- No. Okay. But good boy.

479
00:53:32,674 --> 00:53:34,904
I'm going to swim out. I'll be right back.
You stay right there.

480
00:54:47,185 --> 00:54:48,174
Tom!

481
00:54:58,225 --> 00:55:00,863
Are you all right? What did that man say?

482
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:02,861
"Which way to the motel?"

483
00:57:10,011 --> 00:57:11,808
Did you catch anything?

484
00:57:16,611 --> 00:57:18,283
You smell like fish.

485
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:20,923
You're so soft.

486
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:24,925
So warm.

487
00:58:35,683 --> 00:58:40,234
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!

488
00:58:40,363 --> 00:58:43,035
What? What? What?

489
00:58:43,362 --> 00:58:44,761
- Police.
- What? What?

490
00:58:45,082 --> 00:58:46,481
- Police.
- Who is it?

491
00:58:46,602 --> 00:58:47,717
Police.

492
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,514
What's going on?

493
00:59:05,639 --> 00:59:07,595
Morning, Claire,
just need a word with Stewart.

494
00:59:09,399 --> 00:59:10,514
Stewart!

495
00:59:11,479 --> 00:59:13,071
Yeah. Yeah, I'm coming.

496
00:59:14,839 --> 00:59:17,272
We just need you
to answer a few more questions, Stewart.

497
00:59:17,398 --> 00:59:19,150
- Yeah, okay.
- What's going on?

498
00:59:20,238 --> 00:59:23,196
- Could you come down...
- Yeah, I said okay. I said I'll come, all right?

499
00:59:23,318 --> 00:59:24,307
Okay.

500
00:59:28,677 --> 00:59:29,746
Hello.

501
00:59:31,197 --> 00:59:34,633
- No, I don't have any bloody comment!
- What is going on?

502
00:59:38,997 --> 00:59:39,985
We...

503
00:59:41,396 --> 00:59:44,433
- We found a body.
- Where?

504
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,309
In the river.

505
00:59:47,796 --> 00:59:49,468
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

506
00:59:51,236 --> 00:59:53,066
Yeah, I'll be all right.

507
00:59:53,555 --> 00:59:56,388
You look after Mom, you hear me?
Be back in a moment.

508
01:00:01,075 --> 01:00:05,033
We don't step over bodies in order
to enjoy our leisure activities.

509
01:00:07,274 --> 01:00:10,549
Pack of bloody idiots. I'm ashamed of you.

510
01:00:11,553 --> 01:00:13,748
The whole town's ashamed of you.

511
01:00:21,232 --> 01:00:22,665
Here's Claire.

512
01:00:30,471 --> 01:00:31,745
- Hi.
- Hi.

513
01:00:32,271 --> 01:00:34,626
I don't understand. When did they find her?

514
01:00:34,751 --> 01:00:36,070
What did Stewart tell you?

515
01:00:37,071 --> 01:00:39,425
Not much. There really wasn't time.

516
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:44,026
Bastard!
Billy and I were up all night talking about it.

517
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:49,258
So, are you going to charge us
with something or not, Jimbo?

518
01:00:51,269 --> 01:00:52,418
Get out!

519
01:00:53,989 --> 01:00:55,468
Go on! Piss off!

520
01:01:01,349 --> 01:01:02,383
Here they come.

521
01:01:02,508 --> 01:01:04,305
Here they come. Come on.

522
01:01:12,348 --> 01:01:14,099
We never destroyed any evidence.

523
01:01:14,227 --> 01:01:15,261
Billy!

524
01:01:18,306 --> 01:01:21,616
- Get out of here, you bastard!
- Carl!

525
01:01:21,746 --> 01:01:23,577
The body's been washed
a long way down the stream.

526
01:01:23,706 --> 01:01:24,934
You told the police that?

527
01:01:25,066 --> 01:01:27,420
You found her on Friday? It's Monday.

528
01:01:27,545 --> 01:01:28,739
Oh, please.

529
01:01:28,865 --> 01:01:30,423
- We're just the bloody meat in the sandwich.
- Carl.

530
01:01:32,265 --> 01:01:36,019
- Jesus, Carl twisted his ankle.
- Honestly, Carl could hardly walk.

531
01:01:36,305 --> 01:01:38,738
I couldn't leave the guys without a car.
It would've been irresponsible.

532
01:01:38,864 --> 01:01:41,901
Anyway, we'll discuss this later.
I'll see you. Okay.

533
01:01:44,144 --> 01:01:45,702
You're saying she's a blackfella?

534
01:01:45,824 --> 01:01:47,576
- I told you that.
- No, you didn't.

535
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,375
- Of course I did!
- No.

536
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:50,771
I'm sure I told you.

537
01:01:50,903 --> 01:01:53,622
You couldn't have said it very loudly,
if you said it at all.

538
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:55,938
I'll get the facts for meself.

539
01:02:00,582 --> 01:02:02,732
- What's going on, Rocco?
- I'm sure I told her.

540
01:02:03,902 --> 01:02:05,051
What happened out there?

541
01:02:07,822 --> 01:02:09,016
What did Stewart tell you?

542
01:02:13,501 --> 01:02:15,378
Carl bunged-up his ankle.

543
01:02:15,621 --> 01:02:17,134
He's not up to it any more. You know that.

544
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:22,815
Look...

545
01:02:24,499 --> 01:02:25,818
I've got a really busy day.

546
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:30,453
Don't worry.

547
01:02:31,259 --> 01:02:32,658
I'll make sure Carmel's all right.

548
01:03:05,496 --> 01:03:08,806
Could you have left her there, Terry,
and gone fishing?

549
01:03:10,216 --> 01:03:11,648
I hate fishing.

550
01:03:19,415 --> 01:03:21,485
You think we did the wrong thing
by that girl?

551
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:25,569
No, she didn't care what we did.

552
01:03:25,694 --> 01:03:27,888
She's got no opinion,
no feelings one way or the other.

553
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:29,002
She's dead.

554
01:03:45,172 --> 01:03:46,240
Hey.

555
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:49,246
It's good to be home.

556
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:51,246
Tom's still up.

557
01:03:52,491 --> 01:03:53,970
He needs to ask you some questions.

558
01:03:55,611 --> 01:03:56,964
Was it scary?

559
01:03:58,490 --> 01:03:59,525
No.

560
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:01,165
It was sad.

561
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:04,967
What did the dead lady look like?

562
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:09,246
She looked like she was... She was asleep.

563
01:04:10,609 --> 01:04:13,726
Caylin-Calandria says she has
no clothes on.

564
01:04:14,609 --> 01:04:18,238
Caylin-Calandria doesn't know
as much as she thinks she knows.

565
01:04:19,009 --> 01:04:22,717
Was the dead lady under the water
where it's deep?

566
01:04:24,288 --> 01:04:27,963
Your dad took her out of the water
and he wrapped her up in a sleeping bag

567
01:04:28,088 --> 01:04:30,841
and he made her all nice and warm
and cosy.

568
01:04:34,286 --> 01:04:38,882
Caylin-Calandria says that
there's a serial killer.

569
01:04:39,366 --> 01:04:41,516
She says he's coming after you.

570
01:04:41,966 --> 01:04:43,194
Now listen.

571
01:04:43,686 --> 01:04:47,997
You don't pay attention to anything
anybody says, no matter what they say.

572
01:04:49,165 --> 01:04:51,804
The river is a very long, long way away.

573
01:04:52,245 --> 01:04:54,361
And there are no bad men here.

574
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:55,760
Okay?

575
01:04:58,244 --> 01:04:59,802
Now, go to sleep.

576
01:05:09,163 --> 01:05:11,154
I didn't want to upset you.

577
01:05:11,883 --> 01:05:13,874
I thought it could wait till this morning.

578
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:30,275
What really happened out there?

579
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:33,635
I told you.

580
01:05:34,721 --> 01:05:36,757
Nothing happened. We just...

581
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,597
We got stuck, that's all.

582
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:43,396
Geez, I don't know what the fuss is about.
I really don't.

583
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:45,669
What if it had been Tom in the water?

584
01:05:45,799 --> 01:05:48,267
But it wasn't Tom. It was a stranger.

585
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:54,151
I wish you wouldn't keep dwelling on this.
You're gonna make yourself sick again.

586
01:05:54,279 --> 01:05:56,155
- I didn't make myself sick!
- I didn't mean...

587
01:05:56,278 --> 01:05:59,475
People don't make themselves sick!
It's something that happens to you.

588
01:06:00,158 --> 01:06:02,433
Something bad that happens to you.

589
01:06:04,198 --> 01:06:07,348
I just want you to be okay. That's all.

590
01:06:09,557 --> 01:06:11,752
Jesus, I'm sorry I mentioned it.

591
01:06:16,037 --> 01:06:20,154
Last night, how could you have touched me
like that? After finding her?

592
01:06:22,316 --> 01:06:26,867
Claire, I am so exhausted.

593
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:35,874
- She needed your help.
- She didn't need my help.

594
01:06:36,035 --> 01:06:38,230
She was beyond help. There was...

595
01:06:39,075 --> 01:06:41,747
There was nothing anybody
could do for her.

596
01:07:06,991 --> 01:07:09,266
- Sorry I'm late.
- Sorry you're late?

597
01:07:09,391 --> 01:07:10,870
Where did they get this information from?

598
01:07:13,231 --> 01:07:14,869
- Jesus!
- Yeah, Jesus!

599
01:07:15,391 --> 01:07:18,223
Do not give these people
any more information.

600
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:20,462
We have to stick together on this.

601
01:07:39,909 --> 01:07:41,899
I wonder who she belongs to.

602
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:50,506
Was she raped?

603
01:07:52,786 --> 01:07:54,424
There was some bruising.

604
01:07:56,066 --> 01:08:00,105
- Then again, maybe she was up for it.
- Why would you even think that?

605
01:08:13,385 --> 01:08:16,456
You see this cut around her ankle
down to the bone?

606
01:08:17,904 --> 01:08:19,576
Stewart did that

607
01:08:19,824 --> 01:08:21,576
when he tethered her to a tree.

608
01:08:23,344 --> 01:08:25,812
Too lazy to walk back up to the road.

609
01:08:28,263 --> 01:08:31,539
Then again, maybe they just got off
on the whole thing.

610
01:08:49,062 --> 01:08:51,495
- I haven't seen you before.
- No, I...

611
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,052
How can I help you?

612
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:56,815
What would I need to do if I wanted
to terminate a pregnancy?

613
01:09:24,898 --> 01:09:26,694
We ask St. Brigit

614
01:09:26,817 --> 01:09:29,650
to protect this fine house for another year.

615
01:09:33,737 --> 01:09:36,809
- Bless this house that holds this cross.
- Bless this house that holds this cross.

616
01:09:36,937 --> 01:09:39,245
- Protect it night and day.
- Protect it night and day.

617
01:09:39,376 --> 01:09:41,332
- And those who dwell within
- And those who dwell within

618
01:09:41,456 --> 01:09:45,085
- Protect us from all harm, we pray.
- Protect us from all harm, we pray.

619
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,804
Amen.

620
01:10:01,413 --> 01:10:04,530
- Put it on over.
- I'm confused, hold on.

621
01:10:04,653 --> 01:10:05,972
- This finger with that.
- Like that.

622
01:10:10,933 --> 01:10:12,888
It's my best batch yet.

623
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:17,486
Are you still throwing up?

624
01:10:19,532 --> 01:10:20,487
No.

625
01:10:22,532 --> 01:10:27,764
You know, our children are God's way
of telling us how much he loves us.

626
01:10:28,091 --> 01:10:32,243
Police have tonight released the identity
of a Ngarago girl found murdered

627
01:10:32,371 --> 01:10:34,566
in the Kosciusko National Park.

628
01:10:34,691 --> 01:10:37,602
SBS warns indigenous viewers
that this report

629
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:40,403
contains the name of a deceased person.

630
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:43,285
The body of 19-year-old Susan O'Connor...

631
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:44,399
Don't answer that.

632
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:48,886
...was found late Friday in a remote area
of the park by a group of local fishermen.

633
01:10:49,369 --> 01:10:52,964
But it was not reported to police
until the following Sunday.

634
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:56,363
She went to the country music festival.

635
01:10:56,889 --> 01:10:58,527
Now we don't think she ever got there.

636
01:10:59,928 --> 01:11:01,407
They're animals.

637
01:11:02,328 --> 01:11:06,206
I don't know how any civilised human being
could do what they did.

638
01:11:06,847 --> 01:11:09,645
And I really wonder how differently
they would've acted if she were white!

639
01:11:10,527 --> 01:11:11,515
Oh, God.

640
01:11:12,006 --> 01:11:13,280
Here we go.

641
01:11:17,246 --> 01:11:19,441
- I went and saw her today.
- What?

642
01:11:22,046 --> 01:11:23,763
In the hospital, in the mortuary.

643
01:11:24,925 --> 01:11:26,483
What the hell for?

644
01:11:27,925 --> 01:11:29,881
You tethered her to a tree.

645
01:11:34,245 --> 01:11:37,202
I did it for her own safety.
Besides, you weren't even there!

646
01:11:38,644 --> 01:11:41,112
The sooner they find
the person responsible, the better.

647
01:11:41,244 --> 01:11:43,963
Then all this blame can go where it belongs!

648
01:11:48,283 --> 01:11:50,478
Give me that. Tom has to go now.

649
01:11:54,603 --> 01:11:56,514
I hate this vase, Vanessa.

650
01:11:59,002 --> 01:12:00,151
Oh, Jesus.

651
01:12:00,682 --> 01:12:04,641
You don't have to do that.
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!

652
01:12:06,122 --> 01:12:07,874
Come on, boy. Come on.

653
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:13,514
- Just like old times.
- Yeah, just like the old times, yeah.

654
01:12:46,877 --> 01:12:49,914
- Murderous bastard!
- You arsehole!

655
01:13:11,115 --> 01:13:12,673
Bullshit. I want something done about it.

656
01:13:12,795 --> 01:13:15,070
- Yeah, well, I'm not filing a complaint.
- Why the hell not?

657
01:13:15,195 --> 01:13:16,946
Because you started it.

658
01:13:17,274 --> 01:13:20,185
Started what? Did I murder anybody?
Did I destroy anybody's property?

659
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:23,032
No, you just managed
to make a tragic situation far worse.

660
01:13:23,153 --> 01:13:24,472
Oh, I didn't realise it was your job

661
01:13:24,593 --> 01:13:27,107
to enforce the
political correctness laws, Jimbo.

662
01:13:27,233 --> 01:13:28,586
I would've thought, out of all the people
in this town,

663
01:13:28,713 --> 01:13:29,702
you would be the one

664
01:13:29,833 --> 01:13:31,948
who could understand what her family
is going through right now.

665
01:13:32,072 --> 01:13:35,189
We do understand.
That does not make us responsible!

666
01:14:07,629 --> 01:14:08,744
Carmel.

667
01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:12,382
What's wrong?

668
01:14:12,549 --> 01:14:14,426
You went to the hospital.

669
01:14:16,749 --> 01:14:18,545
I needed to see her for myself.

670
01:14:18,668 --> 01:14:22,501
I can't believe you behaved
so disrespectfully to her and to her family.

671
01:14:22,627 --> 01:14:23,742
Would you walk into a stranger's house

672
01:14:23,867 --> 01:14:25,585
while they were asleep
and have a good old perv at them?

673
01:14:25,707 --> 01:14:26,742
Of course not.

674
01:14:26,867 --> 01:14:28,823
The spirit hasn't gone anywhere.
Dead doesn't mean dead.

675
01:14:28,947 --> 01:14:30,902
- I understand that.
- Do you?

676
01:14:34,826 --> 01:14:36,339
I need to know what happened out there.

677
01:14:37,226 --> 01:14:39,376
Shit happened. Like it always does.

678
01:14:39,506 --> 01:14:41,701
Well, then I have to face it
and not look away.

679
01:14:41,826 --> 01:14:44,339
- Claire, this isn't about you.
- It's about all of us.

680
01:14:45,825 --> 01:14:47,338
Isn't it, Carmel?

681
01:14:47,785 --> 01:14:49,343
I mean, who are we?

682
01:15:02,704 --> 01:15:04,183
- Stewey.
- Hi, Terry.

683
01:15:04,304 --> 01:15:05,941
- Busy morning?
- Yeah.

684
01:15:06,143 --> 01:15:07,417
Yeah, busy enough.

685
01:15:21,182 --> 01:15:22,137
Hi.

686
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:35,655
We have to sort this out, Claire.

687
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:37,932
We have to move on.

688
01:15:42,779 --> 01:15:45,134
Look, I was worried that

689
01:15:47,299 --> 01:15:49,859
the girl would be dragged down
to the rapids.

690
01:15:50,739 --> 01:15:54,890
Carl's ankle was fucked. He couldn't walk.
There was no way we could hike back.

691
01:15:55,018 --> 01:15:56,895
The kid was freaking out.

692
01:15:57,978 --> 01:15:59,377
It was just...

693
01:16:01,538 --> 01:16:03,654
There was nothing we could do.

694
01:16:09,657 --> 01:16:12,615
I don't see why I have to justify myself
to you.

695
01:16:19,656 --> 01:16:20,771
Claire?

696
01:16:25,616 --> 01:16:27,333
What if you'd found a boy in the river?

697
01:16:30,935 --> 01:16:34,051
Wouldn't you have taken him out
and covered him up?

698
01:16:35,254 --> 01:16:36,243
What?

699
01:16:37,534 --> 01:16:38,808
What are you talking about?

700
01:16:41,373 --> 01:16:43,682
- You don't know?
- No, I don't know what you're talking about.

701
01:16:43,813 --> 01:16:45,132
I don't know where you're going with this.

702
01:16:46,493 --> 01:16:47,642
You're not making any sense.

703
01:16:48,853 --> 01:16:50,252
Of course not.

704
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:52,364
That's because I'm the unstable one.

705
01:16:52,492 --> 01:16:56,121
Well, let's face it, Claire, you're not exactly
behaving rationally...

706
01:16:56,252 --> 01:16:57,287
- Oh, for fuck's sake!
- Aren't I?

707
01:16:57,412 --> 01:16:58,367
Bitch.

708
01:16:59,812 --> 01:17:00,801
What?

709
01:17:01,332 --> 01:17:02,684
What? What?

710
01:17:03,691 --> 01:17:05,249
Come on, leave it.

711
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:06,565
What have you got to say?

712
01:17:07,211 --> 01:17:10,328
Please go back to the car.
Claire, go back to the car!

713
01:17:10,451 --> 01:17:11,486
What?

714
01:17:11,651 --> 01:17:14,006
It's okay. Back to the car.

715
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:16,798
- Please go back to the car.
- Let me go.

716
01:18:23,884 --> 01:18:25,032
Come on.

717
01:18:41,162 --> 01:18:42,277
Oh, yeah.

718
01:18:42,802 --> 01:18:44,951
I'm sorry, the bogeyman's home.

719
01:19:36,156 --> 01:19:37,430
- Hello.
- Hi.

720
01:19:38,036 --> 01:19:41,028
Tom and I are collecting money
to pay for Susan O'Connor's funeral.

721
01:19:41,156 --> 01:19:43,670
We all know how important it is to be
a real community at a time like this.

722
01:19:44,916 --> 01:19:45,905
Tom.

723
01:19:47,355 --> 01:19:48,629
Please help.

724
01:19:52,474 --> 01:19:54,192
They're our neighbours.

725
01:19:54,314 --> 01:19:56,225
These people look after their own.

726
01:19:56,354 --> 01:19:58,867
And quite frankly, Claire,
I think that's what you should be doing.

727
01:19:58,993 --> 01:20:00,028
Stop!

728
01:20:07,233 --> 01:20:08,348
Sorry.

729
01:20:12,232 --> 01:20:13,665
That was close.

730
01:20:16,952 --> 01:20:18,385
Listen to me.

731
01:20:18,512 --> 01:20:21,072
When a bad thing happens,
we all have to do a good thing,

732
01:20:21,192 --> 01:20:23,625
no matter how small. All right?

733
01:20:23,751 --> 01:20:27,221
Otherwise, the bad things,
they pile up and they...

734
01:20:27,591 --> 01:20:29,343
Hey, come on, come on.

735
01:20:31,351 --> 01:20:32,579
Is Carmel still angry?

736
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:37,147
You have to make sure
she comes on Saturday.

737
01:20:38,350 --> 01:20:41,148
- Maybe we should cancel it this year.
- No! No! It's what we all need.

738
01:20:42,870 --> 01:20:44,428
Just promise me.

739
01:20:45,109 --> 01:20:47,100
Promise me you'll both come.

740
01:20:54,669 --> 01:20:56,147
That's cheating.

741
01:20:59,627 --> 01:21:00,901
Okay, almost got it.

742
01:21:01,027 --> 01:21:04,576
Can't trust a town
where the publican doesn't live in the pub.

743
01:21:08,946 --> 01:21:13,178
So, just keep your arm straight.
Don't bend your elbow. Go on.

744
01:21:16,186 --> 01:21:18,575
- You did that on purpose!
- Give us a look.

745
01:21:18,706 --> 01:21:20,377
Get off me, you dyke!

746
01:21:24,625 --> 01:21:25,740
Elissa.

747
01:21:25,905 --> 01:21:28,817
- What happened to you?
- I hit Caylin-Calandria.

748
01:21:30,105 --> 01:21:31,743
It was by accident.

749
01:21:35,704 --> 01:21:38,821
Given up drinking altogether, have we,
Miss Muppet?

750
01:21:40,264 --> 01:21:41,822
Oh, Carmel's here.

751
01:21:43,024 --> 01:21:46,140
Oh, thank God.
We can finally all sit down and talk.

752
01:21:46,583 --> 01:21:49,222
Claire, leave it alone.

753
01:21:49,623 --> 01:21:52,091
- Let it heal over.
- We need to get this all sorted.

754
01:21:52,223 --> 01:21:55,339
Don't tell me what I need.
I need life to get back to bloody normal,

755
01:21:55,462 --> 01:21:56,736
whatever that is.

756
01:21:56,862 --> 01:22:00,252
And I don't need you begging all over town
on my behalf.

757
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:01,696
Carmel.

758
01:22:02,661 --> 01:22:04,891
And I don't need you dragging
my granddaughter miles out of her way

759
01:22:05,021 --> 01:22:07,488
to rub her nose in more bloody misery.

760
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:13,095
Hi.

761
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:17,170
Well, they actually think
it might be the same guy that...

762
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:21,129
From last time, from '79,
but they didn't have any DNA back then.

763
01:22:21,259 --> 01:22:24,615
Oh, can we change the frigging subject,
just for once?

764
01:22:25,419 --> 01:22:26,408
Why?

765
01:22:28,859 --> 01:22:31,133
Apparently, there are secret places
in these mountains.

766
01:22:31,258 --> 01:22:33,567
That's right. Secret men's business.

767
01:22:33,698 --> 01:22:35,848
You men shouldn't even
be going fishing up there.

768
01:22:35,978 --> 01:22:37,491
Give me a fucking break!

769
01:22:37,618 --> 01:22:40,974
Our taxes still pay Parks and Wildlife
the last I heard.

770
01:22:42,257 --> 01:22:46,455
Yeah, well, I was told that the
spirits of the dead cross those mountains.

771
01:22:46,817 --> 01:22:48,887
They travel from all over
up to the High Country.

772
01:22:49,017 --> 01:22:50,166
Oh, yeah!

773
01:22:51,177 --> 01:22:53,566
Yeah, I think we broke her journey
by tying her up.

774
01:22:54,056 --> 01:22:55,091
Bullshit.

775
01:22:57,736 --> 01:23:00,648
You know,
I thought Catholics were superstitious,

776
01:23:00,776 --> 01:23:02,812
but your mob take the biscuit, really.

777
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:04,449
- Bloody oath!
- I mean, think about it.

778
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:06,566
It's just a superstition.

779
01:23:06,894 --> 01:23:09,044
You know, journeys, spirits...

780
01:23:09,894 --> 01:23:11,043
Shit!

781
01:23:14,854 --> 01:23:15,923
Oh, Jesus!

782
01:23:16,094 --> 01:23:17,367
- Come here.
- Fuck!

783
01:23:21,173 --> 01:23:24,290
- Come on. Come on, let's get him inside.
- Oh, you fucking prick, Rocco!

784
01:23:26,613 --> 01:23:27,762
Come on.

785
01:23:38,452 --> 01:23:39,646
Carmel!

786
01:23:41,411 --> 01:23:43,606
What was all that, huh? Huh?

787
01:23:51,331 --> 01:23:53,207
I can take care of myself.

788
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:04,358
Here you go, put some water on it.

789
01:24:04,649 --> 01:24:06,685
Let me have a look. Let me have a look.

790
01:24:06,809 --> 01:24:08,925
Oh, yeah, he needs to go to casualty.

791
01:24:09,089 --> 01:24:11,319
I'll agree, love. I'm half sickened.

792
01:24:11,449 --> 01:24:13,837
I don't wanna go to casualty.
I don't want to go to the hospital.

793
01:24:13,968 --> 01:24:14,923
It's okay, I'll take him.

794
01:24:15,048 --> 01:24:18,198
- No way, you're way over the limit.
- Just get me a mirror.

795
01:24:18,327 --> 01:24:19,999
Claire, Stewart needs to go to the hospital.

796
01:24:22,167 --> 01:24:23,156
Here.

797
01:24:24,127 --> 01:24:25,401
- Here, look.
- Okay.

798
01:24:30,966 --> 01:24:32,001
Dad!

799
01:24:36,406 --> 01:24:39,363
See, you always do it when
the adrenaline's still pumping.

800
01:24:39,485 --> 01:24:40,440
That way you don't feel a thing.

801
01:24:41,125 --> 01:24:42,080
Oh, God.

802
01:24:43,325 --> 01:24:44,519
I'm okay.

803
01:24:45,165 --> 01:24:46,120
Okay.

804
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,670
Don't worry, sweetheart. It'll all be all right.

805
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:36,675
Crap.

806
01:25:42,839 --> 01:25:44,909
- I don't want to.
- You have to.

807
01:25:45,599 --> 01:25:47,271
Dad, do I have to go
to the dead lady's house?

808
01:25:47,399 --> 01:25:49,037
Her name is Susan.

809
01:25:50,438 --> 01:25:52,998
- You should get that x-rayed.
- I'm late.

810
01:25:55,278 --> 01:25:58,475
- I wanna go with my dad.
- This isn't open for discussion.

811
01:25:58,598 --> 01:26:02,431
He can come with me if he wants.
Here, go on outside and wait for me.

812
01:26:08,117 --> 01:26:10,153
- I've had enough.
- You are piss weak.

813
01:26:45,913 --> 01:26:49,029
I'm sorry, I don't want to intrude.
I just wanted to give you this.

814
01:26:50,192 --> 01:26:51,147
What's this for?

815
01:26:52,072 --> 01:26:54,427
For the funeral.
The whole town wanted to help.

816
01:26:58,552 --> 01:26:59,587
It's not charity.

817
01:27:00,271 --> 01:27:01,624
Are you buying something then?

818
01:27:16,190 --> 01:27:18,499
What's going on here?
This was supposed to be finished yesterday.

819
01:27:18,630 --> 01:27:21,622
Yeah, it'll be done in an hour.
It's a piece of shit anyway.

820
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:23,229
Just get on with it, will you?

821
01:27:29,468 --> 01:27:31,379
Not now, Tom. I'm flat out.

822
01:27:36,867 --> 01:27:37,822
Hey!

823
01:27:38,387 --> 01:27:41,140
No, I haven't had a chance to talk to him yet.
Just hang on a second.

824
01:27:41,627 --> 01:27:43,265
Tom, this is a private conversation.

825
01:27:47,506 --> 01:27:51,465
Yeah. No, I will. I will.
It's just not the right time.

826
01:28:19,744 --> 01:28:23,531
For some people, going to church
is a bit like going to the dentist.

827
01:28:23,663 --> 01:28:27,292
They'll put up with a lot of toothache
before they'll give in.

828
01:28:27,423 --> 01:28:30,779
If you could just pass this cheque
along to her parents.

829
01:28:30,943 --> 01:28:34,491
The O'Connor family is not
of my congregation.

830
01:28:34,622 --> 01:28:39,217
- They wouldn't welcome my interference.
- I don't understand why this is so hard.

831
01:28:41,581 --> 01:28:43,458
I just want to stay connected to people.

832
01:28:43,581 --> 01:28:46,094
I just want the man I love to be a good man.

833
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:49,898
What's the verdict?

834
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:52,856
Whole thing needs rewiring.

835
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:54,049
Oh, shit.

836
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:59,452
- Well, give it here, I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.

837
01:28:59,579 --> 01:29:02,696
They're having a special ceremony for her
after the funeral

838
01:29:02,979 --> 01:29:05,539
by the river where the music festival's held.

839
01:29:05,659 --> 01:29:06,853
I wouldn't be welcome.

840
01:29:07,899 --> 01:29:09,775
It's tomorrow afternoon.

841
01:29:45,534 --> 01:29:49,732
Your dad could get a splinter in his brain
if he doesn't go to hospital.

842
01:29:51,254 --> 01:29:52,653
I hate Rocco.

843
01:29:54,614 --> 01:29:56,444
They're all zombies now.

844
01:29:57,253 --> 01:29:59,005
That's such crap, man.

845
01:30:00,413 --> 01:30:01,766
Let's go to the underwater city.

846
01:30:28,371 --> 01:30:30,884
Come on! Tom, come in. It's lovely.

847
01:30:32,530 --> 01:30:33,679
Come on!

848
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:36,485
Tom!

849
01:30:40,530 --> 01:30:41,485
Tom!

850
01:30:41,690 --> 01:30:43,805
I know you're just pretending.

851
01:30:44,849 --> 01:30:45,838
Tom!

852
01:30:52,168 --> 01:30:53,681
Caylin-Calandria!

853
01:30:55,527 --> 01:30:57,040
Caylin-Calandria!

854
01:31:07,246 --> 01:31:08,235
Caylin-Calandria!

855
01:31:10,086 --> 01:31:11,599
Caylin-Calandria!

856
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:06,069
Tom!

857
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:08,234
You did it!

858
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:10,395
Tom!

859
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:13,798
What the hell are you two playing at?
Get here.

860
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:17,751
What are you doing? Get in the car now.
Get in the car. You all right?

861
01:32:17,879 --> 01:32:19,312
Get in the car.

862
01:32:19,639 --> 01:32:22,233
I can't believe you, Caylin-Calandria!

863
01:32:25,319 --> 01:32:26,274
Where'd you think he was?

864
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:30,429
Stewart! I've got better things to do
than look after your son.

865
01:32:30,558 --> 01:32:32,310
I didn't ask you
to take care of my son, Jude.

866
01:32:32,438 --> 01:32:34,394
Jude! That's enough.

867
01:32:34,758 --> 01:32:37,830
It's not Caylin-Calandria's fault
that she's alive and our girl's dead.

868
01:32:54,996 --> 01:32:56,145
- Hi.
- Hey.

869
01:32:58,275 --> 01:33:00,869
There's a special service being held
for Susan tomorrow.

870
01:33:00,995 --> 01:33:03,713
I think we should go, all of us. Together.

871
01:33:05,874 --> 01:33:07,353
Go home, Claire.

872
01:33:07,834 --> 01:33:09,711
Tom nearly drowned today.

873
01:33:10,914 --> 01:33:11,949
What?

874
01:33:12,514 --> 01:33:13,663
Go home.

875
01:33:26,672 --> 01:33:31,587
Well, Stewart agreed I should move back in
for a while. Just till things settle down.

876
01:33:38,271 --> 01:33:39,784
Guess what, Mom?

877
01:33:45,951 --> 01:33:47,066
I swam.

878
01:33:48,991 --> 01:33:50,503
That's wonderful.

879
01:33:58,550 --> 01:34:01,110
...by National Nine News reporter,
Bethany Jensen.

880
01:34:01,230 --> 01:34:03,059
Bethany, where exactly is...

881
01:34:03,188 --> 01:34:05,224
He should have been with me.

882
01:34:07,588 --> 01:34:10,898
Maybe he should have learned to swim
when he was a baby like every other kid.

883
01:34:12,628 --> 01:34:16,256
Course, you weren't there then,
and you weren't there today.

884
01:34:18,707 --> 01:34:20,060
Oh, no. No.

885
01:34:22,987 --> 01:34:24,625
I'm not the one who's done anything wrong.

886
01:34:25,386 --> 01:34:28,025
- I'm not the one who's lying.
- About what?

887
01:34:28,426 --> 01:34:30,496
- Just tell me.
- Tell you what?

888
01:34:31,106 --> 01:34:32,425
How it felt.

889
01:34:33,266 --> 01:34:35,143
Fishing with her tied up.

890
01:34:35,426 --> 01:34:36,744
Just tell me, how did it make you feel?

891
01:34:36,865 --> 01:34:40,062
Jesus. Can we please leave this alone?

892
01:34:40,185 --> 01:34:42,653
- Can't you just tell me?
- It felt good!

893
01:34:42,985 --> 01:34:44,100
Is that what you want me to say?

894
01:34:44,225 --> 01:34:46,295
It was a beautiful day.
The river was beautiful.

895
01:34:46,425 --> 01:34:48,256
I felt so fucking alive!

896
01:34:52,184 --> 01:34:54,220
Jesus, if that's a crime, I don't know.

897
01:34:55,944 --> 01:34:57,377
I hate the way you do that.

898
01:34:57,504 --> 01:35:00,575
I hate the way you end a conversation
just because you've had enough.

899
01:35:00,703 --> 01:35:02,659
You know something?
Because I have had enough.

900
01:35:02,783 --> 01:35:06,571
I hate the way you guzzle your beer,
you watch TV, you fuck like a robot.

901
01:35:06,703 --> 01:35:09,375
I work like a fucking dog. That's my life!

902
01:35:10,302 --> 01:35:12,371
The beer and the fuck
are supposed to be a bonus!

903
01:35:12,501 --> 01:35:14,571
What kind of man needs that to feel alive?

904
01:35:14,701 --> 01:35:17,295
What kind of man...
What kind of man needs that?

905
01:35:17,421 --> 01:35:21,016
What kind of woman
runs away from her child, eh? Eh?

906
01:35:21,141 --> 01:35:23,574
- What about that? What about fucking that?
- No! Stop it!

907
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:24,735
- What about that?
- Stewart!

908
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:26,532
- We never talk about that, do we?
- Stewart, stop it!

909
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:30,335
- Fuck! Now, what about running away...
- This stops right now!

910
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:33,372
...running away from your child
like you've done for fucking ages!

911
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:37,777
- Stop it!
- Listen to me! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

912
01:35:39,379 --> 01:35:44,089
No! No! No! No! Fucking no!

913
01:35:50,698 --> 01:35:52,256
Are you all right?

914
01:36:37,693 --> 01:36:39,923
- Hey.
- Hey.

915
01:36:41,213 --> 01:36:43,966
Where were you? It was mental here today.

916
01:36:44,853 --> 01:36:46,285
I'm sorry, man.

917
01:36:50,212 --> 01:36:52,089
Elissa's really homesick.

918
01:36:52,652 --> 01:36:55,120
So, we're all heading up the coast.

919
01:36:57,571 --> 01:36:59,289
She's going to teach me how to surf.

920
01:37:01,171 --> 01:37:02,240
Great.

921
01:37:03,491 --> 01:37:04,560
Look...

922
01:37:05,731 --> 01:37:08,609
Man, I know it sucks,
me pissing off like this.

923
01:37:09,090 --> 01:37:12,207
Well, what can you do?
People come, people go.

924
01:37:13,730 --> 01:37:15,925
- What do I owe you?
- No, don't worry about it, man. It's fine.

925
01:37:16,050 --> 01:37:17,927
No, no. No, no, I insist.

926
01:37:18,210 --> 01:37:19,325
Well...

927
01:37:19,929 --> 01:37:21,486
- Maybe just the three days.
- There you go.

928
01:37:23,408 --> 01:37:24,727
Thanks, man.

929
01:37:25,168 --> 01:37:27,045
I really appreciate this one.

930
01:37:28,368 --> 01:37:30,120
- Take care.
- Thank you.

931
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:33,558
Hey, you shake his hand.

932
01:37:36,327 --> 01:37:37,396
Billy!

933
01:37:38,047 --> 01:37:39,924
It doesn't matter, Elissa.

934
01:37:49,326 --> 01:37:52,875
- See you when I get back.
- Claire, talk to Stewey.

935
01:37:56,045 --> 01:37:57,034
I've tried.

936
01:37:57,165 --> 01:37:58,917
But you haven't told him the truth,
have you?

937
01:38:12,764 --> 01:38:15,756
I'm heading over the mountain
to go to Susan's memorial.

938
01:38:15,884 --> 01:38:17,522
I want you to come with me.

939
01:38:17,644 --> 01:38:20,032
I can't. The kid's fucked off.

940
01:38:21,843 --> 01:38:24,721
- Left me high and dry.
- Then close for the day.

941
01:38:25,282 --> 01:38:27,876
I can't just shut up shop for no reason.

942
01:38:28,602 --> 01:38:30,672
Pretend you're going fishing.

943
01:38:35,641 --> 01:38:38,109
I don't know when I'll be back.
I have something I have to sort out.

944
01:38:40,761 --> 01:38:43,194
Yous can all fuck off as far I'm concerned,

945
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:47,518
but I'll tell you one thing,
whatever happens, nobody is taking my boy.

946
01:38:59,319 --> 01:39:02,629
...the things that you discovered, sir,
over those years

947
01:39:02,759 --> 01:39:04,875
working in the Kosciusko National Park.

948
01:39:04,999 --> 01:39:07,751
The most interesting aspect of it is the...

949
01:39:08,278 --> 01:39:10,792
The wide...
...kind of things you come across.

950
01:39:10,918 --> 01:39:12,715
You obviously then...

951
01:40:54,747 --> 01:40:55,896
Stewart.

952
01:40:57,587 --> 01:40:58,656
Terry.

953
01:41:00,907 --> 01:41:03,374
Hair colour turn out all right, then?

954
01:41:04,426 --> 01:41:05,381
Yeah.

955
01:41:47,582 --> 01:41:48,776
Hey, guys.

956
01:41:49,582 --> 01:41:51,014
Did I break it?

957
01:41:51,781 --> 01:41:53,100
Yeah, yeah.

958
01:41:54,021 --> 01:41:56,216
- Haven't lost my touch then?
- No.

959
01:41:57,941 --> 01:41:59,215
You haven't lost your touch, no.

960
01:42:00,501 --> 01:42:02,968
- Carl reckons Billy's gone.
- Yeah.

961
01:42:03,860 --> 01:42:06,055
Gone off to be a surfer.

962
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:09,090
That lesbian's not finished
with the poor boy yet.

963
01:42:11,580 --> 01:42:12,979
Half his luck.

964
01:42:20,419 --> 01:42:21,898
What happened out there?

965
01:42:24,699 --> 01:42:26,051
I don't know.

966
01:42:31,738 --> 01:42:33,569
Claire's left me again.

967
01:42:36,898 --> 01:42:38,012
No way.

968
01:42:41,737 --> 01:42:43,807
I reckon you've got it wrong.

969
01:44:45,285 --> 01:44:46,956
See this woman here?

970
01:44:47,284 --> 01:44:49,400
She's married to one of the bastards
who found Susan.

971
01:44:53,884 --> 01:44:56,637
- I'm just here to pay my respects.
- Respects?

972
01:44:56,964 --> 01:44:58,362
What respect?

973
01:44:58,842 --> 01:45:00,195
You better piss off.

974
01:45:00,722 --> 01:45:02,440
- Get out of here!
- You leave her alone.

975
01:45:02,562 --> 01:45:04,234
- Piss off!
- Leave her alone, boy.

976
01:45:06,042 --> 01:45:08,033
- You don't belong here.
- Leave her alone.

977
01:46:50,152 --> 01:46:51,107
Mom!

978
01:47:25,428 --> 01:47:27,259
My name is Stewart Kane.

979
01:47:28,588 --> 01:47:30,384
I was one of the men
who found your daughter.

980
01:47:30,507 --> 01:47:32,259
I'm really sorry, okay?

981
01:47:34,787 --> 01:47:36,459
I came to apologise.

982
01:48:37,461 --> 01:48:39,019
Come on, we're gonna walk
through the smoke

983
01:48:39,141 --> 01:48:41,096
so the spirits don't latch onto us.

984
01:48:54,099 --> 01:48:56,852
This is the last song that Susie ever wrote

985
01:48:57,339 --> 01:49:00,251
before she left us to come here to this place.

986
01:49:03,299 --> 01:49:05,493
She was always falling in love

987
01:49:06,098 --> 01:49:07,850
every couple of weeks.

988
01:49:09,698 --> 01:49:11,336
So it's a love song.

989
01:49:12,018 --> 01:49:13,451
That's what she always gave us.

990
01:49:16,577 --> 01:49:20,331
The way that I love you

991
01:49:21,056 --> 01:49:27,528
Has caught me by surprise

992
01:49:28,415 --> 01:49:33,205
I never knew that my heart

993
01:49:34,295 --> 01:49:38,004
Could open this wide

994
01:49:40,214 --> 01:49:43,411
Letting in your sorrow

995
01:49:43,974 --> 01:49:46,408
Letting out my pain

996
01:49:47,654 --> 01:49:50,884
Filling up with a sweet love

997
01:49:51,013 --> 01:49:55,529
As a lake fills with rain

998
01:49:56,493 --> 01:50:02,089
There's no other I love

999
01:50:03,052 --> 01:50:06,647
The way that I love you

1000
01:50:07,852 --> 01:50:13,165
Your kiss makes me feel lighter

1001
01:50:13,851 --> 01:50:17,446
Than the eagle on high

1002
01:50:18,531 --> 01:50:23,844
Your touch makes me burn brighter

1003
01:50:24,531 --> 01:50:28,681
Than the sun in the sky

1004
01:50:30,009 --> 01:50:33,285
When I'm riding in the valley

1005
01:50:34,649 --> 01:50:37,765
I never feel alone

1006
01:50:37,888 --> 01:50:38,843
Be gone.

1007
01:50:38,968 --> 01:50:41,562
Walking by the river

1008
01:50:41,688 --> 01:50:42,723
I hear you singing...

1009
01:50:42,848 --> 01:50:43,883
Be gone.

1010
01:50:44,008 --> 01:50:46,442
...on the stones

1011
01:50:47,848 --> 01:50:52,682
There's no other I love

1012
01:50:53,647 --> 01:50:57,560
The way that I love you

1013
01:51:06,046 --> 01:51:08,241
I want you to come home, Claire.

1014
01:51:20,005 --> 01:51:22,997
The winds appear in winter

1015
01:51:23,125 --> 01:51:27,163
Not fit for beast or man

1016
01:51:28,364 --> 01:51:31,959
Come howling round my cabin

1017
01:51:32,763 --> 01:51:36,198
Calling out your name

1018
01:51:37,602 --> 01:51:40,275
There's no other

1019
01:51:55,721 --> 01:51:56,790
I love

1020
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,673
The way that I love you

1021
01:52:08,305 --> 01:53:08,277

00:01:35,808 --> 00:01:38,327
Fuck. What the fuck?

3
00:01:40,405 --> 00:01:42,724
What the...? What the fuck?

4
00:01:46,642 --> 00:01:48,041
What the...?

5
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,239
What the fuck!

6
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,719
Fuck.

7
00:01:54,717 --> 00:01:56,157
Hello?

8
00:01:57,476 --> 00:01:59,035
Fuck.

00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:07,007
<i>Hello,
Seth.</i>

10
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,549
<i>I wanna play a game.</i>

11
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,948
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

12
00:02:12,188 --> 00:02:13,987
- <i>This is the same helplessness...</i>
- Help!

13
00:02:14,186 --> 00:02:16,065
<i>... you've bestowed onto others.</i>

14
00:02:16,265 --> 00:02:18,304
<i>But now it's onto you.</i>

15
00:02:18,504 --> 00:02:22,262
<i>Some call this karma. I call it justice.</i>

16
00:02:22,462 --> 00:02:24,461
<i>Now, you served five years...</i>

17
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,619
<i>... of what should have been</i>
<i>a life sentence for murder.</i>

18
00:02:27,859 --> 00:02:29,898
<i>A technicality gave you freedom...</i>

19
00:02:30,097 --> 00:02:32,936
<i>... but it inhibited you</i>
<i>from understanding...</i>

20
00:02:33,136 --> 00:02:35,135
<i>... the impact of taking a life.</i>

21
00:02:35,334 --> 00:02:38,293
<i>Today, I offer you true freedom.</i>

22
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:44,050
<i>In 30 seconds, the pendulum will drop</i>
<i>far enough to touch your body.</i>

23
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:48,567
<i>Within sixty seconds</i>
<i>it will cut you in half.</i>

24
00:02:49,247 --> 00:02:50,566
<i>To avoid the pendulum...</i>

25
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:54,604
<i>... all you have to do</i>
<i>is destroy the things that have killed.</i>

26
00:02:54,803 --> 00:02:56,483
<i>Your hands.</i>

27
00:02:56,682 --> 00:03:00,001
<i>You must insert your hands</i>
<i>and push the buttons...</i>

28
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,640
<i>... to start the devices before you.</i>

29
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:04,438
<i>Your bones will be crushed to dust.</i>

30
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:08,636
<i>Will you destroy the things that have</i>
<i>taken life in order to save one, Seth?</i>

31
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:09,955
<i>Make your choice.</i>

32
00:03:13,513 --> 00:03:14,992
No.

33
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,578
It was an accident!

34
00:03:46,294 --> 00:03:47,774
Please.

35
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,289
Okay. Fuck you.

36
00:04:08,802 --> 00:04:11,640
Okay. Okay. Okay.

37
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,630
I did what I was supposed to do.

38
00:06:09,414 --> 00:06:11,852
Let me see your hands.
Let me see your fucking hands.

39
00:06:12,052 --> 00:06:13,251
Where is my daughter? You...

40
00:06:24,405 --> 00:06:25,884
Jesus.

41
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:51,956
<i>Hello, Agent Strahm.</i>

42
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:53,155
<i>If you're hearing this...</i>

43
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:55,913
<i>... then you've finally found</i>
<i>what you've been looking for.</i>

44
00:07:56,113 --> 00:07:59,591
<i>But is the discovery</i>
<i>of my body enough?</i>

45
00:07:59,831 --> 00:08:03,469
<i>Or will your insatiable hunger</i>
<i>to uncover the truth...</i>

46
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:05,988
<i>... push you deeper into the abyss?</i>

47
00:08:06,188 --> 00:08:09,586
<i>Heed my warning: Do not proceed.</i>

48
00:08:09,786 --> 00:08:15,422
<i>For this room can either be</i>
<i>your sanctuary or it can be your grave.</i>

49
00:08:15,982 --> 00:08:17,741
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

50
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,739
Fuck you.

51
00:09:28,221 --> 00:09:29,820
Hey!

52
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,259
Help!

53
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:35,937
Help!

54
00:09:36,537 --> 00:09:39,135
Help!

55
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,086
Help!

56
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:23,356
Go! Go!

57
00:11:25,755 --> 00:11:27,234
You're okay.

58
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,669
- Where's my dad?
- He's gonna be okay.

59
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:38,508
Where's my mom?
Where's my mom?

60
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,866
- Hoffman.
- I got it. I got it.

61
00:11:43,585 --> 00:11:45,184
You okay to walk?

62
00:11:45,384 --> 00:11:47,543
What the hell, man?
What happened? Where's Rigg?

63
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:52,420
Tried to help. He didn't make it.

64
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,739
Nobody made it.

65
00:11:55,618 --> 00:11:57,497
We got a live one.

66
00:12:38,074 --> 00:12:39,313
Hello?

67
00:12:39,753 --> 00:12:40,993
Right away.

68
00:12:41,432 --> 00:12:42,951
Ms. Tuck.

69
00:12:43,351 --> 00:12:44,790
Have a seat.

70
00:12:48,748 --> 00:12:51,107
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Feldman.

71
00:12:52,266 --> 00:12:53,426
Why am I here?

72
00:12:53,985 --> 00:12:56,144
I represent your ex-husband, John.

73
00:12:56,344 --> 00:13:00,701
In the event of his death,
I was instructed to contact you.

74
00:13:00,901 --> 00:13:05,739
You can understand my surprise
when I found out who he really was.

75
00:13:05,938 --> 00:13:08,057
John left something for you.

76
00:13:30,285 --> 00:13:34,642
<i>If you're watching this, Jill,</i>
<i>I'm long gone from this world.</i>

77
00:13:35,642 --> 00:13:40,919
<i>You are my heart, you always</i>
<i>have been. You always will be.</i>

78
00:13:42,158 --> 00:13:47,515
<i>I'm not going to try to explain</i>
<i>my actions of late.</i>

79
00:13:47,715 --> 00:13:51,992
<i>Suffice it to say that I find it difficult</i>
<i>to forgive myself...</i>

80
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:53,831
<i>... for what happened at the clinic.</i>

81
00:13:54,591 --> 00:14:00,708
<i>I permitted, indeed, encouraged your</i>
<i>decisions regarding the people there.</i>

82
00:14:01,227 --> 00:14:05,225
<i>I saw danger and</i> l...
<i>I should have acted sooner.</i>

83
00:14:05,465 --> 00:14:11,621
<i>I'm leaving you a box today, and</i>
<i>its contents are of grave importance.</i>

84
00:14:12,221 --> 00:14:15,659
<i>Even though you and I don't always see</i>
<i>eye to eye on everything...</i>

85
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:19,337
<i>... I deeply believe in you</i>
<i>and I believe that you will know...</i>

86
00:14:19,537 --> 00:14:21,936
<i>... what to do with these materials.</i>

87
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,819
I wanna thank you all
for coming here today.

88
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,378
And I'd like to be the first to say...

89
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:31,536
...that the Jigsaw murders are over.

90
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:37,133
The officers who gave their lives
are being honored here today.

91
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:40,651
But today I'd like to offer
a special honor...

92
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:44,209
...to the detective who's been
on this case right from the beginning...

93
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:48,047
...who proved through hard work
and dedication...

94
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,485
...that the people who died
did not die in vain.

95
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:56,002
Today we honor the newly promoted
Detective Lieutenant...

96
00:15:56,202 --> 00:15:58,241
...Mark Hoffman.

97
00:15:58,481 --> 00:15:59,960
Congratulations.

98
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,999
Thank you so much.

99
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,113
Thank you. Thank you very much.

100
00:16:15,312 --> 00:16:19,309
Throughout this ordeal,
if we've learned anything it's that...

101
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:21,348
...human life is sacred.

102
00:16:22,228 --> 00:16:25,226
And we've learned that every day...

103
00:16:26,425 --> 00:16:28,584
...life should be cherished.

104
00:16:29,464 --> 00:16:31,103
Justice...

105
00:16:31,303 --> 00:16:35,380
...is the backbone
to every peaceful society.

106
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,778
And I believe that true justice
has been served.

107
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:47,819
Detective Hoffman,
you're wanted at the hospital.

108
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:49,498
It's about Agent Perez.

109
00:17:49,698 --> 00:17:51,457
Thank you.

110
00:17:55,135 --> 00:18:00,932
<i>Hello, Agent Perez, and welcome</i>
<i>to the world that you have long studied.</i>

111
00:18:01,132 --> 00:18:03,091
<i>Heed my warning, Agent Perez.</i>

112
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:06,409
<i>Your next move is critical.</i>

113
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:08,408
- <i>Open the door.</i>
- What is that?

114
00:18:13,765 --> 00:18:15,364
I got you.

115
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:40,230
I'm truly sorry about Agent Perez.

116
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:43,788
She said your name, you know.

117
00:18:45,387 --> 00:18:48,105
The last thing she said
was "Detective Hoffman."

118
00:18:48,305 --> 00:18:51,543
Why'd she say that?
Why'd she say your name?

119
00:18:51,743 --> 00:18:53,942
- I don't know.
- No?

120
00:18:54,742 --> 00:18:57,180
How'd you walk out of that building?

121
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,819
How did you?

122
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:02,297
On a gurney with a fucking hole
in my throat.

123
00:19:04,096 --> 00:19:05,176
Look at you.

124
00:19:05,575 --> 00:19:08,534
Couple of scratches and a story
about how your arm straps broke.

125
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:10,493
Jigsaw doesn't make mistakes.

126
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,291
Is this you theorizing again?
Because Jigsaw's dead.

127
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:14,610
I'm not talking about him...

128
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,329
...l'm talking about you
and your whole crooked department.

129
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:20,567
My department's gone. They're all dead.
There's no one left.

130
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:22,326
Besides you.

131
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:26,204
Been chasing Jigsaw
from the beginning...

132
00:19:26,404 --> 00:19:28,283
...and I got him.

133
00:19:28,483 --> 00:19:30,521
So unless you've got
something else to say...

134
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:33,400
...back the fuck off.

135
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,477
Read the papers.
I saved that little girl.

136
00:19:53,548 --> 00:19:55,547
Sorry about Agent Perez.

137
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,665
Shouldn't you be resting?

138
00:19:59,585 --> 00:20:01,464
I'm fine, Erickson.

139
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:05,022
No, you're not, Peter.
That's why I put you on medical leave.

140
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,699
I was supposed to die in that trap.

141
00:20:11,338 --> 00:20:13,857
You never should have been there
without backup.

142
00:20:14,057 --> 00:20:16,855
I wanna talk to Jill Tuck one last time.

143
00:20:18,055 --> 00:20:20,653
You're no longer handling
the case, Peter.

144
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,692
What?

145
00:20:22,892 --> 00:20:24,251
Read it.

146
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:29,528
Over a dozen dead bodies
were recovered at the scene...

147
00:20:29,768 --> 00:20:30,847
...two of which were cops.

148
00:20:31,047 --> 00:20:34,565
Jigsaw's dead, how many lives
did I inevitably save?

149
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:36,924
By endangering yourself and others.

150
00:20:37,124 --> 00:20:38,283
You're off the case.

151
00:20:38,483 --> 00:20:40,202
On whose orders?

152
00:20:40,402 --> 00:20:41,801
Mine.

153
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,719
I'm sorry, Peter. It's over.

154
00:22:25,023 --> 00:22:26,302
Oh, my God.

155
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:34,617
- What is this?
- Hey, don't move.

156
00:22:34,857 --> 00:22:36,736
What did you do to me?

157
00:22:36,936 --> 00:22:37,976
I didn't do anything.

158
00:22:38,415 --> 00:22:40,014
- It's Jigsaw.
- What?

159
00:22:40,254 --> 00:22:43,652
I knew this was gonna happen to me.
This is what he does.

160
00:22:44,772 --> 00:22:46,291
No, it's not Jigsaw.

161
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,809
He's dead.

162
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:52,247
Haven't you watched TV lately?

163
00:22:52,927 --> 00:22:54,566
Yeah, well, whoever it is...

164
00:22:55,366 --> 00:22:56,405
...they're watching us.

165
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:02,921
To make sure we follow the rules.

166
00:23:03,121 --> 00:23:05,480
- Which are what?
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

167
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,119
Unless you want your head
to pop off like a dandelion.

168
00:23:08,318 --> 00:23:10,757
- How do you know that?
- Because I have eyes.

169
00:23:11,956 --> 00:23:14,435
One pull-pin starts the timer
for all of us.

170
00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:20,312
You won't wanna do that unless
you know how it works, now, would you?

171
00:23:20,871 --> 00:23:22,870
You're starting to freak me out, dude.

172
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:28,507
<i>Hello, and welcome.</i>

173
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:33,424
<i>From birth, you've all been given</i>
<i>the advantages of few others.</i>

174
00:23:33,624 --> 00:23:36,343
<i>Yet through poor moral decisions...</i>

175
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:39,541
<i>... you've used these advantages</i>
<i>to selfishly further...</i>

176
00:23:39,741 --> 00:23:43,259
<i>... only yourselves</i>
<i>at the expense of others.</i>

177
00:23:43,459 --> 00:23:47,176
<i>Well, today this singular way of thinking</i>
<i>will be put to the test.</i>

178
00:23:47,376 --> 00:23:52,374
<i>Today, five will become one,</i>
<i>with a common goal of survival.</i>

179
00:23:52,573 --> 00:23:53,733
<i>You are all connected.</i>

180
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,291
<i>A cable runs through</i>
<i>your collar devices.</i>

181
00:23:56,491 --> 00:23:58,170
<i>It can be pulled so tight...</i>

182
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,209
<i>... that you will be decapitated</i>
<i>on the mounted razors.</i>

183
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:06,725
<i>The only way to remove the collar</i>
<i>is with the keys from the glass boxes...</i>

184
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:08,444
<i>... on the pedestals before you.</i>

185
00:24:08,644 --> 00:24:11,763
<i>However, if one of you moves</i>
<i>to retrieve a key...</i>

186
00:24:11,962 --> 00:24:15,321
<i>... the 60-second timer</i>
<i>will begin for you all.</i>

187
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,919
<i>In choosing how to react</i>
<i>to this situation...</i>

188
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,157
<i>... your lifelong instincts</i>
<i>will tell you to do one thing...</i>

189
00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:24,475
<i>... but I implore you to do the opposite.</i>

190
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,314
<i>Let the games begin.</i>

191
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,190
Somebody has to die.

192
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,948
No, no, no, it says,
"Don't listen to your instincts."

193
00:24:37,148 --> 00:24:39,547
- That means don't go for the keys.
- You fucking nuts?

194
00:24:39,747 --> 00:24:41,706
How are we supposed to live
if we don't?

195
00:24:41,906 --> 00:24:44,144
- It's testing our endurance.
- We gotta move, babe.

196
00:24:44,344 --> 00:24:46,343
That timer's connected to those jars.

197
00:24:46,543 --> 00:24:48,342
It didn't say anything
about those jars.

198
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:50,661
- They could be nothing.
- They're nail bombs.

199
00:24:50,861 --> 00:24:52,779
Homemade, probably C-4.

200
00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:54,578
How the fuck do you know that?

201
00:24:54,778 --> 00:24:57,937
She's a fire inspector.
She's seen all kinds of demented shit.

202
00:24:58,136 --> 00:25:00,015
How do you know me?

203
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,332
Hey, man, she's asking you a question.
How do you know her?

204
00:25:08,251 --> 00:25:11,449
How do you know her? Answer me!

205
00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:13,888
Look, let's just keep our cool.

206
00:25:14,087 --> 00:25:17,246
- Okay, we can figure this out.
- We're all here for a reason.

207
00:25:17,965 --> 00:25:20,964
Okay, and we're all connected,
as the message said.

208
00:25:21,163 --> 00:25:22,802
We just need to...

209
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:28,040
- What did you do?
- You go first.

210
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:34,356
It said that we were all born
with advantages.

211
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:36,835
Right? That means
we're all from money.

212
00:25:39,993 --> 00:25:41,512
- I'm not.
- And neither am I.

213
00:25:41,712 --> 00:25:44,470
Hey, nice fucking try, Nancy Drew.

214
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,469
Well, then, what does it mean?

215
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:49,228
We did something wrong
with an advantage from birth.

216
00:25:49,427 --> 00:25:52,866
- That doesn't have to mean money.
- What are you not telling us?

217
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:56,384
You know about her, what do you know
about the rest of us?

218
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:59,182
Would you fucking talk to me?

219
00:25:59,382 --> 00:26:02,300
- Relax.
- I am fucking relaxed.

220
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,699
It's a game, tweaker.

221
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:09,376
Get it? The less you know about me,
the better.

222
00:26:09,616 --> 00:26:12,534
The reason why you fucked up
your charmed existence...

223
00:26:12,734 --> 00:26:15,013
...is pretty obvious to everyone, isn't it?

224
00:26:16,852 --> 00:26:18,651
Fuck you. Fuck you.

225
00:26:18,851 --> 00:26:21,050
Been playing with matches again,
have we?

226
00:26:21,689 --> 00:26:23,528
Fuck all of you and your fucking plan.

227
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:12,707
Unless you wanna be shredded
when those bombs go off...

228
00:28:13,266 --> 00:28:15,505
...I suggest we move on.

229
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:37,413
What are you doing?

230
00:28:37,613 --> 00:28:39,372
Being smart.

231
00:28:48,966 --> 00:28:50,565
Special Agent Strahm's office.

232
00:28:50,765 --> 00:28:54,443
This is Detective Hoffman.
Is Agent Strahm available?

233
00:28:54,643 --> 00:28:57,281
He's not, but I can connect you
to Special Agent Erickson.

234
00:28:57,481 --> 00:28:58,960
He's handling all inquiries.

235
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,520
Please.

236
00:29:02,678 --> 00:29:05,077
<i>You've reached the voice mail box</i>
<i>of Agent Erickson.</i>

237
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:07,316
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

238
00:29:07,556 --> 00:29:09,994
Yeah, this is Detective Hoffman.

239
00:29:10,194 --> 00:29:12,673
I needed to discuss something
with Agent Strahm...

240
00:29:12,873 --> 00:29:14,752
...but I can't seem to track him down.

241
00:29:14,951 --> 00:29:18,310
Could you give me a call?
It would be greatly appreciated.

242
00:30:18,556 --> 00:30:20,714
There you are.

243
00:31:08,247 --> 00:31:10,406
Sister.

244
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:42,148
Peter.

245
00:31:44,907 --> 00:31:48,065
- Cowan, take this to analysis.
- Right away, sir.

246
00:31:50,184 --> 00:31:51,423
What are you doing here?

247
00:31:51,623 --> 00:31:56,060
Just grabbing some stuff from the office.
I'm taking your advice.

248
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:01,457
- Taking some time off, huh?
- Yeah, well, I have to heal up, you know.

249
00:32:02,057 --> 00:32:05,135
You know, I'll keep in touch.
I'll see you around.

250
00:33:35,404 --> 00:33:36,804
Hoffman.

251
00:33:37,043 --> 00:33:40,721
We got another body.
Looks like another Jigsaw victim.

252
00:33:40,921 --> 00:33:44,119
- You up for this?
- Yeah.

253
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:46,678
Typical bio. Murder convict.

254
00:33:46,878 --> 00:33:49,396
Served five years,
just released last month.

255
00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:54,474
I know him.

256
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:57,072
His name's Seth Baxter.

257
00:33:57,552 --> 00:33:59,871
My sister's ex-boyfriend.

258
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,788
This is the guy
that murdered your sister?

259
00:34:03,988 --> 00:34:08,985
He was sentenced to 25 years.
Got it reduced to five on a technicality.

260
00:34:10,585 --> 00:34:13,063
Well, then I'd say justice was served.

261
00:34:22,898 --> 00:34:26,895
You killed him.
Made it look like a Jigsaw trap.

262
00:34:29,454 --> 00:34:31,173
I got you.

263
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,729
Not yet.

264
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:40,128
Don't close the door.
It'll set off the timer.

265
00:34:40,368 --> 00:34:42,806
- Do you know that for sure?
- Educated guess.

266
00:34:43,006 --> 00:34:45,205
What we need to do
is figure out who everyone is.

267
00:34:45,405 --> 00:34:48,963
Okay, well, we know that the dead
woman worked for the fire department.

268
00:34:49,163 --> 00:34:51,521
Not anymore.
She got canned a month ago.

269
00:34:51,721 --> 00:34:54,160
How the fuck do you...?
How the fuck do you know that?

270
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,198
You're responsible for this?
She had her fucking head cut off!

271
00:34:57,398 --> 00:34:58,477
I'm closing the door.

272
00:34:58,677 --> 00:35:01,276
- I'm gonna close the fucking door!
- Just be quiet.

273
00:35:02,715 --> 00:35:04,314
Please.

274
00:35:08,512 --> 00:35:09,671
What's your story?

275
00:35:09,871 --> 00:35:11,870
I work for
the Department of City Planning.

276
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:16,227
- Married? Kids?
- No, and no. Your turn.

277
00:35:16,427 --> 00:35:19,146
You're not gonna tell them
about Daddy?

278
00:35:22,184 --> 00:35:26,502
- My dad is Richard Gibbs.
- The owner of the Cougars?

279
00:35:26,702 --> 00:35:30,979
He's been trying to build a new stadium
for years. Little did he know...

280
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:36,496
...all he had to do is wait for his daughter
to get a job in City Planning.

281
00:35:37,815 --> 00:35:40,334
And you. What about you?

282
00:35:40,534 --> 00:35:42,733
What sort of shady shit
have you been up to?

283
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,811
I'm a senior V.P.
for a real estate development company.

284
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:47,410
So you're boring too.

285
00:35:50,128 --> 00:35:53,766
The Marshvard Group. Yeah,
you can't get a permit in this town...

286
00:35:53,966 --> 00:35:57,124
...without going through
the Department of City Planning.

287
00:35:57,324 --> 00:35:59,963
- Right?
- No, you can't.

288
00:36:00,163 --> 00:36:01,722
What about you?

289
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:05,320
No wife.

290
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:11,236
- No kids that I know of. No job.
- Trust-fund baby. Anyone surprised?

291
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:13,715
I'm so fucking sick of
your self-righteousness.

292
00:36:13,915 --> 00:36:15,034
It's your turn.

293
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:20,071
I'm an investigative journalist
for <i>The Herald.</i>

294
00:36:20,271 --> 00:36:23,709
<i>Herald?</i> That's your accomplishment?
You work for a gossip rag?

295
00:36:23,909 --> 00:36:25,708
Bite your fucking tongue.

296
00:36:25,908 --> 00:36:28,387
What the hell are in those jars?

297
00:36:29,506 --> 00:36:32,944
Let's do this fucking thing
before the bombs go off.

298
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,580
Fuck!

299
00:36:42,259 --> 00:36:45,137
<i>Hello, and welcome to the next lesson.</i>

300
00:36:45,377 --> 00:36:48,455
<i>These walls hold four chambers.</i>

301
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:52,013
<i>These chambers are for safety.</i>

302
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:55,092
<i>However, to access them,</i>
<i>a key is needed.</i>

303
00:36:55,292 --> 00:36:58,810
<i>But only three of the keys</i>
<i>will fit the locks.</i>

304
00:36:58,969 --> 00:37:02,687
<i>These keys are in the glass jars</i>
<i>hanging from the ceiling.</i>

305
00:37:02,967 --> 00:37:06,005
<i>Move quickly, though,</i>
<i>because when the clock ticks down...</i>

306
00:37:06,245 --> 00:37:10,883
<i>... the explosives in the corners</i>
<i>of the room will detonate.</i>

307
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:15,800
<i>With only three points of safety,</i>
<i>which of you will be the odd man out?</i>

308
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,159
<i>Make your choice.</i>

309
00:37:21,357 --> 00:37:22,516
Fuck.

310
00:37:29,392 --> 00:37:32,111
Fuck, it's blank. I need a shape.

311
00:37:35,069 --> 00:37:37,468
Get your hands off that,
you're not going anywhere.

312
00:37:40,106 --> 00:37:42,465
- Stop it!
- Get a clue, you fucking bitch.

313
00:37:42,665 --> 00:37:44,664
It's survival of the fittest.

314
00:38:00,015 --> 00:38:01,774
Blank.

315
00:38:02,973 --> 00:38:04,333
Blank.

316
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:09,050
Shit.

317
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,768
I got it. Got it.

318
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,681
Yes.

319
00:38:32,397 --> 00:38:35,235
Better luck next time, rich boy.

320
00:38:37,394 --> 00:38:39,113
Survival of the fittest, my ass!

321
00:38:52,985 --> 00:38:54,304
Wait.

322
00:39:18,531 --> 00:39:21,489
Everything all right with
Detective Kerr in the Seth Baxter case?

323
00:39:21,689 --> 00:39:22,768
- Yeah.
- Good.

324
00:39:22,968 --> 00:39:25,807
Fisk. You keep me posted.

325
00:39:26,006 --> 00:39:28,525
- Will do.
- Good.

326
00:39:28,725 --> 00:39:33,442
After Seth,
you were involved in every investigation.

327
00:39:41,798 --> 00:39:43,916
When did you first meet Jigsaw?

328
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,599
Stop it, stop it!

329
00:41:01,393 --> 00:41:02,792
Don't!

330
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:10,587
Heel! Heel, I said!

331
00:41:10,787 --> 00:41:12,666
Don't provoke him. Asshole!

332
00:41:13,746 --> 00:41:16,864
Jesus Christ.
Come on, Peewee. Come on.

333
00:41:17,104 --> 00:41:19,422
- Come on, Peewee.
- Peewee.

334
00:41:19,622 --> 00:41:20,982
Shit.

335
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:27,138
Do you mind?

336
00:41:33,455 --> 00:41:35,533
- Going up?
- Yes, thank you.

337
00:41:56,761 --> 00:41:58,840
What floor are you going to?

338
00:42:09,274 --> 00:42:12,472
I think we're both going
to the same place.

339
00:42:44,574 --> 00:42:46,973
You know why you're here, don't you?

340
00:42:49,172 --> 00:42:53,609
They say imitation
is the sincerest form of flattery.

341
00:42:55,528 --> 00:42:58,846
But I find it somewhat distasteful...

342
00:42:59,046 --> 00:43:01,845
...to be given credit for work
that's not mine.

343
00:43:07,721 --> 00:43:09,840
Especially inferior work.

344
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:18,275
Like you,
I know what it's like to lose family.

345
00:43:19,755 --> 00:43:23,073
I know what it's like
not to be able to protect loved ones.

346
00:43:24,032 --> 00:43:26,631
It's a powerless feeling.

347
00:43:31,828 --> 00:43:32,987
I wouldn't do that.

348
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:40,543
Hair trigger.

349
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:45,260
What do you see?

350
00:43:48,978 --> 00:43:52,016
Vengeance can change a person.
Make you into something...

351
00:43:52,216 --> 00:43:55,135
...you never thought
you were capable of being.

352
00:43:56,774 --> 00:44:00,172
But unlike you, I've never killed anyone.

353
00:44:00,372 --> 00:44:03,650
- I give people a chance.
- You call this a chance?

354
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,729
We'll see.

355
00:44:06,928 --> 00:44:11,965
- Our game's just begun.
- Our game? You don't even know me.

356
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:18,841
I know you.
I've followed you as you've pursued me.

357
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:22,079
I know you. I know about your sister.

358
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,718
I know how you cared for her.

359
00:44:31,194 --> 00:44:33,113
I know she was your only family.

360
00:44:33,353 --> 00:44:35,152
Leave me alone.

361
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:40,069
No!

362
00:44:47,745 --> 00:44:51,783
You sit in bars until closing.
You drink so you can sleep.

363
00:44:51,982 --> 00:44:53,462
You stagger to your car...

364
00:44:53,661 --> 00:44:57,699
...and then you start it all over again
the next day.

365
00:45:01,097 --> 00:45:04,535
Then I discovered
what you do for recreation.

366
00:45:11,052 --> 00:45:12,771
You can dispense justice...

367
00:45:12,971 --> 00:45:16,968
...and give people a chance
to value their lives in the same moment.

368
00:45:18,767 --> 00:45:20,566
And by the way...

369
00:45:21,326 --> 00:45:23,844
...the blade on your pendulum
was inferior.

370
00:45:25,364 --> 00:45:28,242
If you want a true edge...

371
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,439
...you have to used tempered steel.

372
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:36,637
Tempering's better for the long haul.

373
00:45:36,837 --> 00:45:38,836
You in this for the long haul, detective?

374
00:45:40,435 --> 00:45:43,593
I've been a cop for 20 years.
Is that long enough for you?

375
00:45:43,793 --> 00:45:47,831
Then you and I both know the statistics
for repeat offenders in this city.

376
00:45:48,031 --> 00:45:53,108
67.5 percent of criminals
are back in prison within three years.

377
00:45:53,308 --> 00:45:54,787
What do you want from me?

378
00:45:55,387 --> 00:45:58,985
So you might look at what you did
to Seth as a kind of public service.

379
00:46:00,704 --> 00:46:03,782
She was my only family.
He didn't deserve a chance.

380
00:46:04,062 --> 00:46:06,620
- He was an animal.
- Everybody deserves a chance!

381
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,699
You didn't see the blood!

382
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:11,098
You didn't see
what he fucking did to her!

383
00:46:11,298 --> 00:46:14,696
Killing is distasteful...

384
00:46:16,255 --> 00:46:17,774
...to me.

385
00:46:20,892 --> 00:46:25,010
There is a better, more efficient way.

386
00:46:33,005 --> 00:46:35,604
What do you see...? Look!

387
00:46:36,044 --> 00:46:39,242
- What do you see?
- Tell me what you want.

388
00:46:41,201 --> 00:46:45,638
I wanna know if you have
what it takes to survive.

389
00:47:05,187 --> 00:47:07,226
Fuck you.

390
00:47:07,426 --> 00:47:08,705
Fuck you.

391
00:47:10,704 --> 00:47:13,223
You see, it's a different method
that I'm talking about.

392
00:47:13,942 --> 00:47:15,861
If a subject survives my method...

393
00:47:16,341 --> 00:47:18,820
...he or she is instantly rehabilitated.

394
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:22,977
Now, you want a chance?

395
00:47:24,456 --> 00:47:26,055
You want a chance?

396
00:47:26,295 --> 00:47:27,415
I'll give you a chance.

397
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:38,888
I'm the man you call Jigsaw.

398
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:42,766
It's your duty to bring me in...

399
00:47:43,006 --> 00:47:45,684
...but I know who you are...

400
00:47:45,884 --> 00:47:48,363
...and I know what you've done.

401
00:47:52,241 --> 00:47:53,640
So this is blackmail.

402
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,919
No, no, no.

403
00:47:56,358 --> 00:47:58,597
This is redemption.

404
00:48:02,675 --> 00:48:05,673
Just giving you an option, that's all.

405
00:48:06,473 --> 00:48:08,871
Now, you can arrest me...

406
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:13,149
...but doing so,
your life ends as you know it.

407
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:14,668
Or...

408
00:48:14,868 --> 00:48:16,267
...you could explore...

409
00:48:17,546 --> 00:48:19,865
...a method of rehabilitation...

410
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:22,384
...that'll permit you to sleep at night.

411
00:48:44,131 --> 00:48:45,691
Or I could kill you right now.

412
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:48,289
But you're not a true killer.

413
00:48:49,288 --> 00:48:50,528
That's your dilemma...

414
00:48:50,728 --> 00:48:54,166
...and the information that I have on you
is exactly where it needs to be...

415
00:48:54,366 --> 00:48:58,483
...and it will be released
in the event of my disappearance.

416
00:48:59,243 --> 00:49:01,761
They'll never believe your word
over mine.

417
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,399
You willing to take that risk?

418
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:08,678
Risk of ruining your own life...

419
00:49:08,877 --> 00:49:11,316
...in order to protect
a corrupt legal system...

420
00:49:11,516 --> 00:49:15,034
...that puts murderers
back on the streets?

421
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,870
How would your sister feel?

422
00:49:23,069 --> 00:49:25,068
You're at a crossroads, detective.

423
00:49:25,868 --> 00:49:27,947
Make your choice.

424
00:49:50,374 --> 00:49:52,813
Did you help Jigsaw get all of them?

425
00:50:39,746 --> 00:50:43,464
<i>Detective Hoffman,</i>
<i>this is Special Agent Erickson.</i>

426
00:50:43,664 --> 00:50:47,302
You had something you needed
to discuss about the Jigsaw case?

427
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:50,540
Yes. I stopped by Agent Strahm's room
tonight at the hospital...

428
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:51,819
...but he wasn't there.

429
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:54,218
- <i>I hope he's all right.</i>
- Oh, yeah, he's fine.

430
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:56,816
Agent Strahm was theorizing
about the possibility...

431
00:50:57,016 --> 00:51:00,215
...of an additional accomplice
to Jigsaw, other than Amanda Young.

432
00:51:01,054 --> 00:51:03,932
<i>Someone who might be</i>
<i>currently unknown.</i>

433
00:51:04,132 --> 00:51:06,851
<i>Did he ever mention</i>
<i>anything like that to you?</i>

434
00:51:07,091 --> 00:51:10,129
- No, but then again, I'm new to the case.
- <i>Yeah, well...</i>

435
00:51:10,329 --> 00:51:13,087
...maybe you could get him to
contact me at his earliest convenience.

436
00:51:13,287 --> 00:51:15,606
Will do. And...

437
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:17,925
...in your theorizing...

438
00:51:18,124 --> 00:51:20,603
...who exactly did you suspect
would be an accomplice?

439
00:51:22,362 --> 00:51:24,801
Well, he suspected
someone on the inside.

440
00:51:25,001 --> 00:51:26,200
<i>Someone with access.</i>

441
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,639
It's an interesting theory.

442
00:51:28,838 --> 00:51:32,117
Detective, what do you say we reconnect
in the morning?

443
00:51:32,636 --> 00:51:34,155
You got it.

444
00:52:17,971 --> 00:52:19,250
Dead.

445
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:22,288
That guy was an asshole,
but he was smart.

446
00:52:22,488 --> 00:52:23,528
We could've used him.

447
00:52:24,087 --> 00:52:26,446
Yeah, well, someone had to die.

448
00:52:28,525 --> 00:52:30,604
Would you rather it'd been you?

449
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:31,209
How'd they get you?

450
00:54:42,409 --> 00:54:43,728
Screw you!

451
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:47,646
I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you!

452
00:54:53,843 --> 00:54:56,121
I'm gonna kill...

453
00:55:38,817 --> 00:55:40,856
<i>Hello, Paul.</i>

454
00:55:41,056 --> 00:55:44,094
<i>Did you cut yourself</i>
<i>because you truly wanted to die...</i>

455
00:55:44,294 --> 00:55:47,972
<i>... or did you just want some attention?</i>

456
00:55:48,212 --> 00:55:49,811
<i>Tonight, you'll show me.</i>

457
00:55:50,051 --> 00:55:54,129
<i>If you want to live,</i>
<i>you'll have to cut yourself again.</i>

458
00:55:55,648 --> 00:55:59,566
<i>How much blood will you shed</i>
<i>to stay alive, Paul?</i>

459
00:56:50,137 --> 00:56:53,095
I didn't expect to feel any remorse.

460
00:56:53,695 --> 00:56:55,614
The heart cannot be involved.

461
00:56:55,814 --> 00:56:58,932
Emotionally, there can be nothing there.

462
00:56:59,132 --> 00:57:01,770
It can never be personal.

463
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:04,529
- Let's go.
- No.

464
00:57:04,729 --> 00:57:06,808
You're not done yet.

465
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:12,045
Tonight you will see the difference
between killing and rehabilitation.

466
00:57:24,398 --> 00:57:28,076
There is another detective
that you should be aware of.

467
00:57:28,275 --> 00:57:29,875
His name's Tapp.

468
00:57:30,074 --> 00:57:32,473
He's smart, and he's getting closer.

469
00:57:32,673 --> 00:57:34,752
I know who he is.

470
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:42,028
I need you to lead him
to someone for me.

471
00:57:44,306 --> 00:57:46,225
A doctor.

472
00:57:47,425 --> 00:57:50,503
A healer who needs some healing.

473
00:57:54,301 --> 00:57:56,659
Is this yours, doctor?

474
00:58:04,175 --> 00:58:07,653
You supplied these police files,
didn't you?

475
00:58:39,435 --> 00:58:42,713
You're assuming this is gonna play out
the way you want it.

476
00:58:42,913 --> 00:58:44,952
I assume nothing.

477
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:55,386
I anticipate the possibilities,
and I let the game play out.

478
00:58:55,906 --> 00:58:58,744
Then why do you need Amanda
in the game?

479
00:59:01,463 --> 00:59:04,581
To ensure that the rules are followed.

480
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:09,978
She won't make decisions for anyone.
She'll just...

481
00:59:11,257 --> 00:59:13,376
...offer choices.

482
00:59:15,335 --> 00:59:17,454
Little to your left.

483
00:59:25,329 --> 00:59:27,648
That leaves a lot to chance.

484
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,477
If you're good
at anticipating the human mind...

485
00:59:52,074 --> 00:59:54,873
...it leaves nothing to chance.

486
01:00:07,985 --> 01:00:09,584
It's time.

487
01:00:27,414 --> 01:00:29,813
Jesus Christ.

488
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:37,209
Great. More bombs.

489
01:00:40,967 --> 01:00:43,765
All right. What'd you do to get here?

490
01:00:43,965 --> 01:00:48,522
l... I did something,
and a bunch of people were killed.

491
01:00:48,722 --> 01:00:50,321
I didn't mean to.

492
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:53,759
They're still dead.

493
01:00:53,959 --> 01:00:55,798
- That's why you're here?
- Yeah.

494
01:00:55,998 --> 01:00:58,957
Shouldn't you have
gone to jail for something like that?

495
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:01,235
Nobody else knows.

496
01:01:05,753 --> 01:01:07,152
Somebody does.

497
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:19,585
I didn't kill anybody,
if that's what you're asking.

498
01:01:19,785 --> 01:01:21,064
I wasn't.

499
01:01:22,623 --> 01:01:24,662
I grant building permits.

500
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:30,779
And yeah, some people might have been
more deserving than others...

501
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:32,977
...but you know what?
That's the business.

502
01:01:33,177 --> 01:01:35,896
So if someone tells you different,
then they're just stupid.

503
01:01:36,136 --> 01:01:38,614
Or naןve. Or both.

504
01:01:38,814 --> 01:01:39,933
Bullshit.

505
01:01:40,133 --> 01:01:44,091
You take bribes. You're a fucking liar.
You cheat people. That's not nice.

506
01:01:44,291 --> 01:01:45,810
Yeah, well.

507
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:49,368
I'm sure she's not exactly
Mother Teresa either.

508
01:01:49,568 --> 01:01:51,207
No, I'm not.

509
01:01:52,127 --> 01:01:55,725
I build condos in one of the most
densely populated cities in the country.

510
01:01:55,924 --> 01:01:59,442
You don't put up a new building
without tearing down a few old ones.

511
01:01:59,642 --> 01:02:03,240
So we're all bags of shit that deserve
to be here. That's good. That's great.

512
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:04,440
Fucking great.

513
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,958
So is that what you think this is?

514
01:02:07,158 --> 01:02:09,197
You don't think there's
any other connection?

515
01:02:09,397 --> 01:02:11,196
No, I do.

516
01:02:11,396 --> 01:02:13,714
I do. And I don't give a shit.

517
01:02:13,914 --> 01:02:16,953
Close the fucking door.
We have to hear the rules.

518
01:02:28,106 --> 01:02:29,545
<i>Hello, and welcome.</i>

519
01:02:29,745 --> 01:02:35,262
<i>You must all be eager to learn the next</i>
<i>important lesson in your transformation.</i>

520
01:02:35,462 --> 01:02:40,179
<i>The game before you is designed</i>
<i>to bridge the gap between you all.</i>

521
01:02:40,379 --> 01:02:44,017
<i>In order to open the five locks</i>
<i>on the door out of this room...</i>

522
01:02:44,217 --> 01:02:47,935
<i>... the five electrical circuits</i>
<i>powering them must be closed.</i>

523
01:02:48,135 --> 01:02:49,614
<i>The only way to do this...</i>

524
01:02:49,814 --> 01:02:54,891
<i>... is to find a way to connect</i>
<i>all five cords to the bath water.</i>

525
01:02:55,091 --> 01:02:58,209
<i>Close the circuits</i>
<i>and the door will open.</i>

526
01:02:58,409 --> 01:02:59,688
<i>But you must work quickly...</i>

527
01:02:59,888 --> 01:03:03,366
<i>... for in three minutes, an electrical</i>
<i>current will surge through this room...</i>

528
01:03:03,606 --> 01:03:06,285
<i>... locking the door forever.</i>

529
01:03:06,485 --> 01:03:10,722
<i>Who will bridge the gap?</i>
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

530
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,479
Jesus Christ.

531
01:03:21,276 --> 01:03:23,795
It's not gonna reach.
How the fuck are we gonna do this?

532
01:03:23,995 --> 01:03:25,474
Come on!

533
01:03:27,513 --> 01:03:29,472
You're gonna get in the tub...

534
01:03:30,151 --> 01:03:32,550
...and we're gonna connect
the five cords to you.

535
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:34,149
But you're gonna kill me too.

536
01:03:36,348 --> 01:03:37,307
Get in.

537
01:03:37,507 --> 01:03:40,305
Yeah, I'm more of a shower guy.
I don't think I'm gonna do that right now.

538
01:03:40,505 --> 01:03:42,144
Get in the fucking tub.

539
01:03:42,384 --> 01:03:44,863
Fuck you, you bitch.
You get in the fucking tub.

540
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:47,901
No, don't do it.

541
01:03:48,101 --> 01:03:49,780
Please, no.

542
01:04:00,454 --> 01:04:03,492
You killed her.
You fucking killed her.

543
01:04:03,732 --> 01:04:05,571
I didn't trust her.

544
01:04:05,771 --> 01:04:08,370
Jesus Christ. What is it with you two?

545
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:11,048
Just shut up and help me with the body.

546
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:31,756
Hey, hey. No.
Don't let your body touch hers.

547
01:04:59,821 --> 01:05:01,899
Oh, my God, it's a hook.

548
01:05:05,258 --> 01:05:07,896
Stick it in her head or we don't get out.

549
01:05:10,894 --> 01:05:12,853
Just do it.

550
01:05:33,082 --> 01:05:34,561
Come in.

551
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,958
Sir. It's Jill Tuck.

552
01:05:39,158 --> 01:05:40,757
Good evening.

553
01:05:40,957 --> 01:05:42,077
Special Agent Erickson.

554
01:05:42,277 --> 01:05:44,236
Thank you for seeing me
so late in the day.

555
01:05:44,435 --> 01:05:45,555
Not a problem.

556
01:05:45,755 --> 01:05:47,314
That'll be all.

557
01:05:48,833 --> 01:05:51,351
Please, have a seat.

558
01:05:52,631 --> 01:05:56,069
So, what do you need from us?

559
01:05:56,708 --> 01:05:58,907
I think I'm being followed.

560
01:05:59,147 --> 01:06:01,466
Well, that sounds more like
police work, Miss Tuck.

561
01:06:03,185 --> 01:06:05,304
I don't think they can help me.

562
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:09,381
- Because?
- Because it's you. The FBI.

563
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,779
I don't understand.

564
01:06:12,979 --> 01:06:16,217
It started when John was first identified
as the Jigsaw killer.

565
01:06:16,457 --> 01:06:19,096
It didn't surprise me then,
but I'm still being followed.

566
01:06:19,296 --> 01:06:22,774
By who, Miss Tuck?
Who would be following you?

567
01:06:22,974 --> 01:06:24,973
I think it's the agent
who interrogated me.

568
01:06:26,092 --> 01:06:27,371
Agent Strahm.

569
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:32,448
- And why would he be following you?
- I don't know.

570
01:06:37,366 --> 01:06:40,604
- Who else have you told about this?
- Only you.

571
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:08,108
What's going on with Amanda?

572
01:07:08,308 --> 01:07:11,946
Didn't you tell me the only way
to truly offer enlightenment...

573
01:07:12,466 --> 01:07:14,265
...is by detaching emotionally?

574
01:07:17,823 --> 01:07:20,581
But you can have something
Amanda doesn't.

575
01:07:21,181 --> 01:07:23,100
Anonymity.

576
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:26,978
That's the greatest protection.
That's what I've given you.

577
01:07:27,617 --> 01:07:30,256
I need you to set up a game...

578
01:07:31,215 --> 01:07:34,893
...that may not be entirely clear to you
right now.

579
01:07:36,132 --> 01:07:38,731
But I assure you that
the people being tested...

580
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:42,689
...are part of something much larger.

581
01:07:43,128 --> 01:07:44,847
They're connected.

582
01:07:45,047 --> 01:07:50,844
So in the end,
all the pieces will fit together...

583
01:07:52,963 --> 01:07:55,002
...and it'll be clear.

584
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:02,517
- Amanda will fail you.
- We'll see.

585
01:08:03,397 --> 01:08:05,916
What are you doing?

586
01:08:12,192 --> 01:08:15,670
- What's this?
- It's time to play a game.

587
01:08:17,709 --> 01:08:19,068
Help.

588
01:08:19,268 --> 01:08:21,107
Help me. What is this?

589
01:08:21,307 --> 01:08:23,466
What is this? Please.

590
01:08:25,345 --> 01:08:30,781
Why are you keeping me here?
What is this place? What is this place?

591
01:09:03,323 --> 01:09:06,042
We were all supposed to die.

592
01:09:09,999 --> 01:09:12,718
He's just fucking testing you.

593
01:09:12,918 --> 01:09:14,517
Where is my daughter?

594
01:09:17,915 --> 01:09:19,794
Help!

595
01:09:20,234 --> 01:09:21,913
He didn't make it.

596
01:09:22,432 --> 01:09:24,231
Nobody made it.

597
01:09:24,551 --> 01:09:26,630
You were supposed to be the hero.

598
01:10:05,288 --> 01:10:07,247
Peter, where the hell are you?

599
01:10:09,965 --> 01:10:11,525
Hello?

600
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:24,397
<i>You've reached the voice mail</i>
<i>for Special Agent Peter Strahm.</i>

601
01:10:24,597 --> 01:10:26,356
<i>Leave a message.</i>

602
01:10:29,235 --> 01:10:32,793
Cowan. I wanna put a locator
on Strahm's mobile phone.

603
01:10:33,632 --> 01:10:35,231
Right away, sir.

604
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:36,950
Call me right back.

605
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,669
Right.

606
01:11:39,355 --> 01:11:42,593
- What the hell is that?
- It's our next nightmare.

607
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:51,108
There are blades in here.

608
01:11:55,546 --> 01:11:57,505
It's connected to the door.

609
01:11:57,705 --> 01:11:59,903
When the beaker fills up,
the door opens.

610
01:12:02,822 --> 01:12:04,701
Fills with what?

611
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:09,298
Blood. Our blood.

612
01:12:10,218 --> 01:12:15,215
I think an arm is supposed to go in there
to fill the beaker.

613
01:12:15,774 --> 01:12:18,613
Wait. Why can't we just use
the water from the other room?

614
01:12:18,853 --> 01:12:19,972
No, the slots are closed.

615
01:12:20,212 --> 01:12:23,290
We have to stick our arm in to
keep them open, but they'd get stuck.

616
01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:25,249
We need to close that door.

617
01:12:26,888 --> 01:12:28,367
So, what?

618
01:12:28,967 --> 01:12:34,204
We fight to the death, and one gets to
freedom with the other person's blood?

619
01:12:39,681 --> 01:12:40,840
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

620
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,199
Do you still have the keys
from that first room?

621
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:45,638
- Yeah.
- Try one of them on that door.

622
01:12:45,837 --> 01:12:48,916
- It won't work.
- No, it might. This one has a keyhole.

623
01:12:53,913 --> 01:12:56,312
It... It's not even the same lock.

624
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:01,788
Wait, why are there five slots
in this machine?

625
01:13:02,508 --> 01:13:04,507
Shouldn't there only be one?

626
01:13:11,503 --> 01:13:13,462
They all would have worked.

627
01:13:38,648 --> 01:13:39,727
There you are, Strahm.

628
01:13:40,766 --> 01:13:43,685
All right. I got him.

629
01:13:51,361 --> 01:13:53,519
I don't think this is a good idea.

630
01:13:53,719 --> 01:13:55,798
The tub wasn't meant for one person.

631
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:57,917
We were supposed to hold
one cable each...

632
01:13:58,117 --> 01:14:00,435
...and suffer a small shock.

633
01:14:00,835 --> 01:14:02,194
It was meant for five people.

634
01:14:02,394 --> 01:14:04,633
They all were. Every game.

635
01:14:04,833 --> 01:14:07,312
We only needed one key
in the first room.

636
01:14:07,511 --> 01:14:11,109
They all worked, and any one of them
would have opened every collar.

637
01:14:11,629 --> 01:14:15,507
In the second room, the three tubes were
large enough for more than one person.

638
01:14:15,707 --> 01:14:18,745
We were supposed to work together
so we all survived.

639
01:14:18,945 --> 01:14:20,584
That's the game.

640
01:14:20,784 --> 01:14:22,863
Your instincts will tell you to do
one thing...

641
01:14:23,063 --> 01:14:25,141
...but I implore you to do the opposite.

642
01:14:25,341 --> 01:14:26,820
Oh, God.

643
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:29,939
Yeah. Big fucking whoops.

644
01:14:45,650 --> 01:14:47,289
<i>Hello, and welcome.</i>

645
01:14:47,489 --> 01:14:49,328
<i>This journey</i>
<i>has been one of discovery...</i>

646
01:14:49,528 --> 01:14:51,606
<i>... and hopefully you've discovered</i>
<i>that the whole...</i>

647
01:14:51,846 --> 01:14:53,805
<i>... is greater than the sum of its parts.</i>

648
01:14:54,525 --> 01:14:58,483
<i>The human body, for instance,</i>
<i>is an astoundingly durable creation.</i>

649
01:14:58,683 --> 01:15:01,441
<i>It contains approximately 10 pints</i>
<i>of blood...</i>

650
01:15:01,641 --> 01:15:05,599
<i>... yet it is still able to operate</i>
<i>with just half of that.</i>

651
01:15:05,798 --> 01:15:08,477
<i>The device before you is</i>
<i>one of sacrifice.</i>

652
01:15:08,717 --> 01:15:10,156
<i>A sacrifice of blood.</i>

653
01:15:10,356 --> 01:15:14,793
<i>In order to open the door, the beaker</i>
<i>must be filled to the marked level...</i>

654
01:15:14,993 --> 01:15:18,351
<i>... a level that is of no coincidence.</i>

655
01:15:18,551 --> 01:15:20,750
<i>This amount can come</i>
<i>from any one of you.</i>

656
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:24,468
<i>That does not matter.</i>
<i>What does matter is time.</i>

657
01:15:24,668 --> 01:15:27,346
<i>For in 15 minutes,</i>
<i>if the beaker is not filled...</i>

658
01:15:27,546 --> 01:15:31,784
<i>... the bombs will explode</i>
<i>and the doors will be sealed forever.</i>

659
01:15:31,984 --> 01:15:36,821
<i>So now I ask you, how much blood</i>
<i>will you give in order to survive?</i>

660
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:44,497
Fuck! Fuck.

661
01:15:45,176 --> 01:15:50,453
All right, so one person can fill the
beaker with ten pints of blood and die.

662
01:15:50,693 --> 01:15:52,612
Or two people can fill it...

663
01:15:52,812 --> 01:15:54,811
...with five pints...

664
01:15:55,011 --> 01:15:57,090
...and maybe live.

665
01:15:58,529 --> 01:15:59,768
What are we gonna do?

666
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:33,149
I lied.

667
01:16:34,708 --> 01:16:37,747
I know the investigative journalist
in there. His name is Charles.

668
01:16:37,946 --> 01:16:40,545
He was writing a story about what I did.

669
01:16:41,824 --> 01:16:43,623
What'd you do?

670
01:16:45,462 --> 01:16:47,621
A dealer gave me...

671
01:16:47,821 --> 01:16:51,139
...an ounce of heroin to burn down
an abandoned building.

672
01:16:51,339 --> 01:16:52,338
But it wa...

673
01:16:52,538 --> 01:16:55,577
Oh, God. It wasn't abandoned.
There was eight people in there.

674
01:16:55,776 --> 01:16:59,135
Eight people died.

675
01:16:59,494 --> 01:17:02,932
And the feds got involved.

676
01:17:03,132 --> 01:17:05,731
And I got caught but I made a deal
and my dad got me off.

677
01:17:05,971 --> 01:17:09,249
The guy who hired me disappeared and
nothing happened. Nothing happened.

678
01:17:36,433 --> 01:17:38,312
That's how she knew me.

679
01:17:38,552 --> 01:17:40,711
The woman in the tub.

680
01:17:41,471 --> 01:17:43,829
The fire. It's what connects us.

681
01:17:44,629 --> 01:17:47,747
The fire inspector who wrote
the bogus accident report...

682
01:17:47,987 --> 01:17:51,905
...the city planner who pushed through
the residential permits...

683
01:17:52,304 --> 01:17:55,823
...the journalist that buried
the investigative story...

684
01:17:56,022 --> 01:17:58,981
...the rich-kid junkie
who was the patsy...

685
01:17:59,181 --> 01:18:02,059
...and the real estate developer
who set it all in motion.

686
01:18:02,739 --> 01:18:06,976
We killed eight people and stole
the property, and nobody cared.

687
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:08,855
Nobody cared?

688
01:18:09,415 --> 01:18:12,053
Eight people and their families cared.

689
01:18:12,253 --> 01:18:15,891
The feds cared. Look at my fucking arm.
I cared! I cared!

690
01:18:16,611 --> 01:18:18,010
But you didn't face justice.

691
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:19,649
None of us did.

692
01:18:19,849 --> 01:18:22,048
Why did they all do it?

693
01:18:22,248 --> 01:18:23,327
Why? Was it for money?

694
01:18:24,286 --> 01:18:26,725
This was your plan?
You were the one behind it?

695
01:18:27,605 --> 01:18:29,563
There was eight people
in that building.

696
01:18:29,763 --> 01:18:31,722
You had to know that.
Did you know that?

697
01:18:33,161 --> 01:18:34,601
You're a monster.

698
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:40,477
So are you.

699
01:18:41,317 --> 01:18:44,195
We both deserve to be here.

700
01:19:37,125 --> 01:19:39,764
I can't do this alone. Look at me.
I can't do this alone.

701
01:19:39,964 --> 01:19:41,003
Okay. It's okay.

702
01:20:06,469 --> 01:20:07,708
We have to go on three.

703
01:20:26,138 --> 01:20:27,137
One.

704
01:20:35,213 --> 01:20:37,091
Two.

705
01:20:40,929 --> 01:20:43,088
Put your hand in the hole!

706
01:20:51,483 --> 01:20:53,082
Three!

707
01:22:22,232 --> 01:22:23,591
<i>Hello, Agent Strahm.</i>

708
01:22:24,111 --> 01:22:25,830
<i>If you are hearing this...</i>

709
01:22:26,030 --> 01:22:28,788
<i>... then you have once again</i>
<i>found what you're looking for.</i>

710
01:22:28,988 --> 01:22:30,348
<i>Or so you think.</i>

711
01:22:30,547 --> 01:22:33,386
<i>Your dedication is to be commended.</i>

712
01:22:33,586 --> 01:22:38,223
<i>But I ask you if you have learned</i>
<i>anything on your journey of discovery.</i>

713
01:22:38,423 --> 01:22:40,262
<i>As the old adage goes:</i>

714
01:22:40,462 --> 01:22:45,939
<i>"Fool me once, shame on you.</i>
<i>Fool me twice, shame on me. "

715
01:22:46,418 --> 01:22:50,576
<i>The situation you find yourself in</i>
<i>is one of trust.</i>

716
01:22:50,776 --> 01:22:55,213
<i>So I ask you, Special Agent Strahm,</i>
<i>have you learned to trust me?</i>

717
01:22:55,413 --> 01:23:00,650
<i>The only way to survive this room</i>
<i>is by entering the glass box before you.</i>

718
01:23:00,890 --> 01:23:05,847
<i>Pain will be incurred,</i>
<i>but you have a chance of survival.</i>

719
01:23:33,912 --> 01:23:34,991
We did it.

720
01:23:35,191 --> 01:23:36,510
We won.

721
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:38,309
We won.

722
01:25:26,568 --> 01:25:29,087
I got you, you motherfucker.

723
01:25:51,114 --> 01:25:52,393
Drop it!

724
01:25:52,593 --> 01:25:54,552
I said drop it!

725
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:02,628
Who did this to you?

726
01:26:02,868 --> 01:26:04,107
Who did this to you?

727
01:26:06,705 --> 01:26:07,705
We won.

728
01:26:08,265 --> 01:26:09,944
We won.

729
01:26:10,143 --> 01:26:12,422
We worked together.

730
01:26:22,936 --> 01:26:27,654
I need immediate medical assistance.
1293 Sandburst Drive.

731
01:27:07,871 --> 01:27:09,910
Jesus, Peter.

732
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:28,459
Tell me how to open it.

733
01:27:28,899 --> 01:27:29,898
How do I open it?

734
01:27:42,891 --> 01:27:46,609
<i>However, if you choose not to,</i>
<i>you will never be heard from again.</i>

735
01:27:46,849 --> 01:27:49,008
<i>Your body will never be found.</i>

736
01:27:49,208 --> 01:27:51,046
<i>You will simply vanish.</i>

737
01:27:51,886 --> 01:27:57,723
<i>I ask you, Special Agent Strahm,</i>
<i>have you learned enough to trust me?</i>

738
01:27:57,923 --> 01:27:59,642
<i>Will you heed my warning?</i>

739
01:27:59,842 --> 01:28:01,720
- <i>For if you do not...</i>
- Fuck you.

740
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:04,279
<i>... this room will forever be your tomb.</i>

741
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:07,517
<i>And my legacy will become yours.</i>

742
01:28:07,957 --> 01:28:10,555
If you're good at anticipating
the human mind...

743
01:28:10,795 --> 01:28:13,354
- I think I'm being followed.
- Who would be following you?

744
01:28:13,594 --> 01:28:15,912
I wanna talk to Jill Tuck one last time.

745
01:28:16,112 --> 01:28:18,311
He suspected someone on the inside.

746
01:28:20,710 --> 01:28:23,028
- it leaves nothing to chance.

747
01:28:26,466 --> 01:28:28,066
We were all supposed to die.

748
01:28:29,425 --> 01:28:31,064
You were supposed to be the hero.

749
01:28:34,742 --> 01:28:36,141
<i>Make your choice.</i>

750
01:28:41,018 --> 01:28:42,497
Cowan.

751
01:28:42,737 --> 01:28:43,937
Yeah, this is Erickson.

752
01:28:44,137 --> 01:28:46,495
I want you to put out an APB.

753
01:28:46,935 --> 01:28:49,693
Suspect's name is Peter Strahm.

754
01:28:50,173 --> 01:28:51,812
Yeah, that's right.

755
01:28:52,012 --> 01:28:54,011
Special Agent Peter Strahm.

756
01:29:16,438 --> 01:29:18,877
I'm gonna stop you, you son of a bitch.

757
01:29:22,235 --> 01:29:25,073
I know who you are. I know.

2
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:56,176
- Please don't kill me.

3
00:00:56,178 --> 00:00:58,846
I'll do anything that you want.

4
00:01:00,548 --> 00:01:02,550
Do you want to kiss me?

5
00:01:04,053 --> 00:01:05,954
Is that what you want?

6
00:01:07,122 --> 00:01:10,091
You want me to take
my clothes off?

7
00:01:11,427 --> 00:01:12,527
You...

8
00:01:13,596 --> 00:01:15,530
You want to touch me?

9
00:01:15,532 --> 00:01:17,198
You can touch me.

10
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:21,637
Is that what you like?

11
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:24,073
You want to see more?

12
00:01:38,122 --> 00:01:39,155
- What's the matter?

13
00:01:39,157 --> 00:01:40,810
- I'm sorry, I just...

14
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,664
I wasn't sure if...

15
00:01:42,864 --> 00:01:45,662
Adele told you there
was gonna be nudity, right?

16
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:47,664
Yeah, we want to
make real sure that signal

17
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,466
doesn't get crossed.

18
00:01:49,468 --> 00:01:51,348
- Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:51,621 --> 00:01:52,893
I just, I wasn't sure if...

20
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:55,006
oh, she's wondering
if we needed her to...

21
00:01:55,008 --> 00:01:56,307
oh, you
mean like right now?

22
00:01:56,309 --> 00:01:57,308
- Yeah, no.

23
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,309
That's not necessary.

24
00:01:58,311 --> 00:01:59,577
- Okay.

25
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,245
Yeah, we can see
how beautiful you are.

26
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:02,980
- No, look, it's...

27
00:02:02,982 --> 00:02:05,049
We appreciate your determination,
but she did tell you

28
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:09,655
that the nudity is fairly
extensive though, Adele, right?

29
00:02:09,657 --> 00:02:13,191
Um, she just said
that there was nudity.

30
00:02:13,193 --> 00:02:14,626
- Nah, it's extensive.

31
00:02:14,628 --> 00:02:16,261
- You're okay with that?

32
00:02:16,263 --> 00:02:17,187
Is that?

33
00:02:17,357 --> 00:02:18,090
'Cause if it's not cool.

34
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,098
What we're
saying is we need someone

35
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,266
who's not gonna...

36
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:23,269
yeah, we
cannot show up on set,

37
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:25,538
and have the girl just change
her mind at the last minute,

38
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,539
you know?

39
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,074
- Yeah, no.

40
00:02:28,076 --> 00:02:29,642
Adele explained it to me.

41
00:02:29,644 --> 00:02:31,511
Okay, but
sometimes, even then,

42
00:02:31,513 --> 00:02:34,347
the agent and manager
explain it, and then,

43
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:36,316
you gotta tell us now,
because this film,

44
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:38,686
the way we're gonna shoot's
gonna be very verite.

45
00:02:38,688 --> 00:02:40,521
A lot of long takes.

46
00:02:40,523 --> 00:02:42,690
It would, it has to be you.

47
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:44,158
It can't be a double.

48
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,359
- Don't worry, sweetheart.

49
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:48,529
We'll make sure
you look beautiful.

50
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:51,565
- Uh, yeah, no, that's fine.

51
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:52,633
That's fine.

52
00:02:53,636 --> 00:02:54,736
Um,

53
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:57,339
should I?

54
00:02:57,341 --> 00:02:59,708
- Yes, please.

55
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,542
- Can we go back?

56
00:03:00,544 --> 00:03:02,010
- Sure.

57
00:03:02,012 --> 00:03:04,112
Where are we going
back to, honey?

58
00:03:04,114 --> 00:03:05,013
- Oh, um.

59
00:03:07,616 --> 00:03:09,552
How about, "I'll do
anything you want?"

60
00:03:09,554 --> 00:03:10,686
Is that okay?

61
00:03:10,688 --> 00:03:12,021
Yeah,
whatever, sweetheart.

62
00:03:12,023 --> 00:03:13,689
It's all about you.

63
00:03:23,601 --> 00:03:25,502
- You want to kiss me?

64
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:28,605
Is that what you want?

65
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:30,040
You think I'm
gonna fall for that?

66
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:33,176
I don't know, I don't know what
you want from me.

67
00:03:33,178 --> 00:03:35,712
I'll take my clothes off.

68
00:03:35,714 --> 00:03:36,780
You want to touch me?

69
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:38,648
You can touch me.

70
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,584
Yeah, you like that?

71
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,521
You want to see more?

72
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,023
You can see more.

73
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:47,759
Is that what you want?

74
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:52,163
You want me to take
my clothes off?

75
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,170
You want to touch me?

76
00:03:58,172 --> 00:03:59,638
You can touch me.

77
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,809
Is that what you want?

78
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,579
It's just a couple of days.

79
00:04:39,748 --> 00:04:42,149
- It's three nights.

80
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:42,850
Four days.

81
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,394
Movie you auditioned for today,

82
00:04:53,596 --> 00:04:55,764
where does it shoot?

83
00:04:55,766 --> 00:04:57,833
- Um, in Colombia.

84
00:04:57,835 --> 00:04:58,834
- The country?

85
00:04:58,836 --> 00:05:01,437
- No, the city, in Missouri.

86
00:05:05,142 --> 00:05:07,143
- Is it a slasher film?

87
00:05:08,712 --> 00:05:11,514
They're, what, meth addicts?

88
00:05:11,516 --> 00:05:13,783
Zombie meth addicts on icicles?

89
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:17,554
Please tell me you're
not running around naked,

90
00:05:17,556 --> 00:05:19,389
screaming and crying.

91
00:05:20,258 --> 00:05:23,327
You're hiding your body from me?

92
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:24,228
Beth.

93
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:29,399
You know, there's a
hundred art films.

94
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:31,735
If you want mine, i
can download right now,

95
00:05:31,737 --> 00:05:33,671
where you had your
fucking clothes off.

96
00:05:33,673 --> 00:05:35,507
You know that, right?

97
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:38,476
What about it?

98
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:41,613
Are you getting
naked again, or what?

99
00:05:42,648 --> 00:05:43,681
- I don't know.

100
00:05:43,683 --> 00:05:46,351
I didn't read the whole script.

101
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,902
You want me to cancel my trip?

102
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,802
- No.

103
00:06:04,772 --> 00:06:05,872
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:06,674 --> 00:06:07,641
I'm a jerk.

105
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,582
- I just feel like a bad friend.

106
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,951
- Hey, stop talking like that.

107
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,855
You're a good friend.

108
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:28,362
The two of you will go
away, have a nice time.

109
00:06:28,364 --> 00:06:29,897
It'll be good for you.

110
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:30,798
What?

111
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:34,202
I like Anna.

112
00:06:34,204 --> 00:06:35,203
- No you don't.

113
00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:36,238
- I do.

114
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,407
- You think she's a bully.

115
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:40,676
- She's a little intense.

116
00:06:40,678 --> 00:06:41,977
Just, the whole career
obsession thing.

117
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:43,845
I just don't know if it's
such a great influence

118
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:46,682
for you to be
around, that's all.

119
00:06:46,684 --> 00:06:47,983
But I like Anna.

120
00:06:47,985 --> 00:06:49,924
- You're a terrible liar.

121
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,255
You are.

122
00:06:52,623 --> 00:06:54,724
Maybe that's why I trust you.

123
00:06:54,726 --> 00:06:55,792
- You trust me?

124
00:06:55,794 --> 00:06:57,393
- Mm-hmm.

125
00:06:57,395 --> 00:06:59,696
- Big mistake. Big mistake.

126
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:06,502
Hey.

127
00:07:06,504 --> 00:07:07,403
- Hmm?

128
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:11,976
Sorry for the way i
talked to you before.

129
00:07:13,712 --> 00:07:15,012
It wasn't nice.

130
00:07:16,948 --> 00:07:21,252
Wish it didn't bother
me so much, but it does.

131
00:07:22,587 --> 00:07:23,487
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:28,327 --> 00:07:31,663
I mean, do you think that
i like to take my clothes off

133
00:07:31,665 --> 00:07:36,434
in a room full of hot
lights and total strangers?

134
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:39,037
If you don't,
why do you do it?

135
00:07:42,342 --> 00:07:43,576
- What's this?

136
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:46,979
The guy who gave me the
estimate said my spark plugs

137
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:48,351
were misfiring or something?

138
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:49,178
- Right.

139
00:07:49,378 --> 00:07:51,884
Well, also, there was a problem
with your oxygen sensor,

140
00:07:51,886 --> 00:07:53,519
but, don't worry, we took
care of that for you.

141
00:07:53,521 --> 00:07:54,754
- Oh, you did.

142
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:57,491
Okay, what are you
doing right now?

143
00:07:59,294 --> 00:08:00,294
- Ma'am?

144
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:01,928
- Are you lying to me?

145
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,797
Because the guy who
gave me the estimate

146
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:05,966
didn't say anything
about any oxygen sensor.

147
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:08,368
He said my spark
plugs were misfiring.

148
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,536
- Well, ma'am.

149
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:10,971
I apologize if that's
the case, but...

150
00:08:10,973 --> 00:08:12,373
- what?

151
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,908
What do you mean, if?

152
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,044
I assure you that's the case.

153
00:08:16,046 --> 00:08:18,379
Well, I apologize
for the confusion, but...

154
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:19,881
- there is no confusion.

155
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:22,450
The guy who gave me the
estimate didn't say anything

156
00:08:22,452 --> 00:08:26,421
about any, what,
fucking oxygen sensor.

157
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,923
Well, ma'am,
the fact of the matter

158
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:31,794
is that oxygen sensor has
malfunctioned fairly frequently.

159
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:33,996
- Oh, I bet they do.

160
00:08:33,998 --> 00:08:36,398
I take pride in
running an honest business,

161
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,868
so I apologize if some
mistake was made here...

162
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,938
- okay, now you keep saying if.

163
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,541
A mistake was made.

164
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,476
A mistake was definitely made.

165
00:08:46,478 --> 00:08:48,878
Ma'am, there's no
need to raise your voice here.

166
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,113
- No?

167
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:52,515
I show up here expecting
to pay for one repair,

168
00:08:52,517 --> 00:08:54,918
and there's an extra charge
for 300 fucking dollars

169
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,754
slipped in that I know
absolutely nothing about?

170
00:08:57,756 --> 00:09:00,124
Okay, there is no need
for that kind of language,

171
00:09:00,126 --> 00:09:01,826
ma'am.

172
00:09:01,828 --> 00:09:05,963
Okay, well $300 is a lot
of fucking money to me,

173
00:09:05,965 --> 00:09:08,699
so you'll excuse me if i
don't appreciate the fact

174
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:11,135
that you're trying to
fucking steal it from me.

175
00:09:11,137 --> 00:09:12,970
- I'm doing no such thing.

176
00:09:12,972 --> 00:09:15,106
Oxygen sensors
fail all the time.

177
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:16,975
If you've got a broken one
and you don't repair it,

178
00:09:16,977 --> 00:09:19,010
your car's gas mileage is
gonna drop, and over time,

179
00:09:19,012 --> 00:09:20,946
it's gonna cost you a lot more.

180
00:09:20,948 --> 00:09:22,647
- No, no, no.

181
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:24,516
That's not the point.

182
00:09:24,518 --> 00:09:27,586
The point is it wasn't
in the estimate.

183
00:09:27,588 --> 00:09:29,821
Even if you're telling the
truth, I didn't approve

184
00:09:29,823 --> 00:09:30,922
of the repair.

185
00:09:30,924 --> 00:09:32,859
That's all that matters.

186
00:09:32,861 --> 00:09:35,128
Well, ma'am, normally
i would give the customer

187
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,963
the benefit of the
doubt, but the fact is,

188
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:40,032
I really don't
like your attitude.

189
00:09:40,034 --> 00:09:41,067
- Oh, I'm sorry.

190
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:42,568
You don't like my attitude?

191
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,803
- That's right.

192
00:09:43,805 --> 00:09:46,072
I mean, if you were a
touch more ladylike.

193
00:09:46,074 --> 00:09:48,642
- Are you fucking kidding me?

194
00:09:48,644 --> 00:09:51,979
This is your fucking
problem, not mine.

195
00:09:52,814 --> 00:09:53,847
- I wasn't there.

196
00:09:53,849 --> 00:09:55,115
I don't know who said what.

197
00:09:55,117 --> 00:09:56,417
Oh, you're just
absolving yourself

198
00:09:56,419 --> 00:09:58,066
of any responsibility now?

199
00:09:58,975 --> 00:09:59,253
Fine.

200
00:09:59,453 --> 00:10:01,088
You know what, I'm not
gonna stand here and argue

201
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,825
with a fucking criminal.

202
00:10:03,827 --> 00:10:05,727
I'll pay for the spark plugs,
but I'm disputing the rest

203
00:10:05,729 --> 00:10:07,061
of the charges.

204
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,471
- Houses, apartments, condos.

205
00:10:16,473 --> 00:10:19,175
Offices...
- Paul?

206
00:10:19,177 --> 00:10:20,009
Whoa.

207
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:20,876
- Hi.

208
00:10:20,878 --> 00:10:21,911
- Hi, how's it going?

209
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:22,912
- Good, how are you?

210
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,047
- You're not behind the counter.

211
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:25,981
Not used to that.

212
00:10:25,983 --> 00:10:27,183
- It's my day off.

213
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:28,017
- Yeah, uh-huh.

214
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,084
- Where you going?

215
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,085
- Uh, camping.

216
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:30,920
- Yeah?

217
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:31,754
- Mm-hmm
- cool.

218
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,588
- Where about?

219
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,789
- Big sur.

220
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,025
- Big sur.
- Yeah.

221
00:10:35,027 --> 00:10:36,092
- That's where this one's going.

222
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,728
Anna's aunt's got
a house up there.

223
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,197
Little old girls getaway.

224
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:41,164
- Like now?

225
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,166
- Yeah, just, for the weekend.

226
00:10:43,168 --> 00:10:44,163
- Weird.

227
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,458
No, no.

228
00:10:45,658 --> 00:10:49,773
It's funny, 'cause I was
just thinking about you

229
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,075
the other day, you know.

230
00:10:51,077 --> 00:10:52,610
I'm doing this short,
and I was thinking

231
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:53,845
of using Anna.

232
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:58,082
Yeah, I would just call
her, but there's no money,

233
00:10:58,084 --> 00:10:59,984
so I didn't wanna
like offend her.

234
00:10:59,986 --> 00:11:02,753
Do you think she'd
be offended if?

235
00:11:02,755 --> 00:11:04,522
Do you think she'd
do it for free?

236
00:11:04,524 --> 00:11:06,224
No, no, she'd probably,
she'd probably do it.

237
00:11:06,226 --> 00:11:08,827
Yeah, she usually does whatever.

238
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:10,028
- Okay.

239
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:13,832
- Okay.

240
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:14,933
- Yeah.
- Cool.

241
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:16,068
- Maybe I'll see you up there?

242
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,135
- Yeah.

243
00:11:17,137 --> 00:11:18,570
- Cool.

244
00:11:23,244 --> 00:11:24,244
- You okay?

245
00:11:24,246 --> 00:11:26,246
- Yeah, fine. I'm fine.

246
00:11:34,623 --> 00:11:35,755
- She's here!

247
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,267
All right.

248
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:47,268
Got everything?

249
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,302
- Yeah.

250
00:11:48,304 --> 00:11:49,303
- I'll get that.

251
00:11:49,305 --> 00:11:51,171
- Thank you.

252
00:11:55,645 --> 00:11:57,212
Well, okay, but you're
not listening to me.

253
00:11:57,214 --> 00:11:59,147
I don't have the fucking money.

254
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:00,649
A
hardship letter could result

255
00:12:00,651 --> 00:12:01,287
in lower late fees.

256
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,489
No, I don't want
lower late fees!

257
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:06,321
I want no late fees, because
this isn't my fucking fault.

258
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,303
It's your fault.

259
00:12:07,503 --> 00:12:08,590
Then we're gonna have

260
00:12:08,592 --> 00:12:09,324
to freeze your card.

261
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:10,960
- Well, fuck you.

262
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:23,272
- Um, do you want me to drive?

263
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:24,674
- No, it's fine.

264
00:12:29,714 --> 00:12:30,914
- I'm really sorry about that.

265
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,982
- It's fine.

266
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:35,752
- Are you okay?

267
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,155
- Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm fine.

268
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,362
You look tired.

269
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,968
- Uh, yeah, I guess, maybe.

270
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,272
I guess you've been
really busy, right?

271
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,608
- Not really.

272
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,282
- Okay, ready?

273
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,768
Is your boss
still harassing you?

274
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,561
- Of course.

275
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,292
I'm his favorite.

276
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:25,271
He told me he had a dream
when he came on my tits

277
00:13:25,273 --> 00:13:26,906
the other day, so.

278
00:13:26,908 --> 00:13:30,244
Oh my god,
you have to quit.

279
00:13:35,717 --> 00:13:37,351
- The money's just not as good,

280
00:13:37,353 --> 00:13:41,822
and I can't afford
to take

281
00:14:02,714 --> 00:14:06,282
tuxedo park, that like
rich place, the mansion.

282
00:14:06,284 --> 00:14:08,151
- I forgot about tuxedo park.

283
00:14:08,153 --> 00:14:08,655
- Yeah.

284
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:09,563
- Was that where it was?

285
00:14:09,763 --> 00:14:11,821
Yes, don't you remember
we like thought we

286
00:14:11,823 --> 00:14:13,890
were gonna go to this
horrible slum thing,

287
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:15,291
and it ended up being this
mansion, and we didn't...

288
00:14:15,293 --> 00:14:16,993
- tuxedo park.

289
00:14:16,995 --> 00:14:18,328
Yes, and everybody was
actually wearing a tuxedo

290
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,363
in tuxedo park.

291
00:14:19,365 --> 00:14:21,832
And we had like
jeans, and nothing else.

292
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:23,033
- Yes, yes, yes.

293
00:14:23,035 --> 00:14:24,001
- Him. Him.

294
00:14:25,336 --> 00:14:26,403
- He liked me.

295
00:14:26,405 --> 00:14:27,438
- Yeah, he did.

296
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,839
He totally did.

297
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:31,375
Oh my god, when
did he tell you that?

298
00:14:31,377 --> 00:14:34,012
I think when I was
working at union pool.

299
00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:34,979
- Wait a second.

300
00:14:34,981 --> 00:14:36,481
When did you work at union pool?

301
00:14:36,483 --> 00:14:39,711
That time that I was
guest DJing with that boy

302
00:14:39,944 --> 00:14:40,299
that I liked.

303
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:42,087
Who was the
boy that you liked?

304
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,321
- That guy, Steven.

305
00:14:43,323 --> 00:14:45,223
Oh, god, he was
such an asshole.

306
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:47,025
- No, he wasn't that bad.

307
00:14:47,027 --> 00:14:48,026
- Are you?

308
00:14:48,028 --> 00:14:49,147
He walked all over you.

309
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:50,323
- Not really.

310
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,331
Oh, shit, I can't
believe I forgot to tell

311
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,766
you this.

312
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:54,934
I saw him before
i moved out here.

313
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,168
- You did?

314
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,170
Yeah, he was like
sitting on the ground

315
00:14:58,172 --> 00:15:00,206
outside the Starbucks
in union square,

316
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:03,209
and he had this like mustache.

317
00:15:03,211 --> 00:15:05,479
Well, I'm not like
necessarily against a mustache.

318
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:06,913
- No, no, no, no, no.

319
00:15:06,915 --> 00:15:09,816
This was like a straggly
like wispy situation.

320
00:15:09,818 --> 00:15:10,917
- Ew.
- - It was glazed.

321
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:11,918
It was horrible.

322
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,186
- Ew.

323
00:15:13,188 --> 00:15:14,187
- I think he had a nose bleed.

324
00:15:14,387 --> 00:15:15,622
Oh my god, you're
messing with me.

325
00:15:15,822 --> 00:15:16,846
I think he
was just like bleeding

326
00:15:16,995 --> 00:15:17,858
all over the sidewalk.

327
00:15:18,058 --> 00:15:21,329
You're totally lying,
you're totally lying to me.

328
00:15:21,331 --> 00:15:23,164
No, I'm pretty
sure that's what happened.

329
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,432
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

330
00:15:26,101 --> 00:15:28,202
Wait, so he told
you he liked me?

331
00:15:28,204 --> 00:15:29,303
- Who, Blake.

332
00:15:29,305 --> 00:15:30,138
- Yeah.

333
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,439
- Yes, I think so.

334
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:32,406
- Why didn't you tell me?

335
00:15:32,408 --> 00:15:34,308
- I am telling you.

336
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,409
- Well, yeah, thanks.

337
00:15:35,411 --> 00:15:36,511
Like five years later.

338
00:15:36,513 --> 00:15:38,447
I didn't know
that you liked him.

339
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:39,448
You really liked him?

340
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,549
- Yes.

341
00:15:41,818 --> 00:15:42,518
- Whoops.

342
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,486
I feel like you're
wrong anyways.

343
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:46,121
- No, I'm not.

344
00:15:46,123 --> 00:15:47,790
Yes, you are, and
I'm remembering sort of...

345
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:48,791
- excuse me.

346
00:15:48,793 --> 00:15:51,226
I am so sorry to interrupt.

347
00:15:51,228 --> 00:15:52,928
I mean, I never do
anything like this.

348
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,999
I'm actually a private
person, you know, myself, but,

349
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:58,902
haven't I seen you in something?

350
00:15:58,904 --> 00:16:00,270
You're in TV, right?

351
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:01,905
- Yeah.

352
00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:02,906
- I knew it.

353
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:03,907
I knew it.

354
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:06,209
What have I seen you in?

355
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:07,410
- I don't know.

356
00:16:07,412 --> 00:16:08,444
- Oh, gosh.

357
00:16:08,446 --> 00:16:08,974
I know it is.

358
00:16:09,174 --> 00:16:09,703
I think I know.

359
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:13,150
Oh, I know, I remember,
it's wendecalm.

360
00:16:13,152 --> 00:16:15,252
You are so good in that.

361
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:16,253
- Uh, thank you.

362
00:16:16,255 --> 00:16:17,321
- You were so good.

363
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:18,322
- Thanks.

364
00:16:18,324 --> 00:16:19,523
- And so nice.

365
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:22,026
Do you mind if i
get your autograph?

366
00:16:22,028 --> 00:16:24,228
Because it would
mean a lot to me.

367
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,497
I'm Sandra.
- Sure.

368
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:26,565
Sure.

369
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:27,833
- Nice to meet you.

370
00:16:27,835 --> 00:16:29,000
Here's a fountain pen.

371
00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:30,468
I hope you like it.

372
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,104
- This is my friend, Anna.

373
00:16:33,106 --> 00:16:34,906
She's also an actress.

374
00:16:34,908 --> 00:16:37,108
Have i
seen you in anything?

375
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,177
- No, I would be surprised.

376
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:41,614
- I am just blown away by this.

377
00:16:42,482 --> 00:16:45,218
Do you mind if I take a photo?

378
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,135
- No, not at all.

379
00:16:46,578 --> 00:16:47,090
- Oh, my god.

380
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,590
I'm like just so excited about
this, I can't even tell you.

381
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,625
Uh, it's right there.

382
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:55,361
Thank you.

383
00:16:58,433 --> 00:16:59,633
Thank you.
- Sure.

384
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:02,269
- Okay, one, two, three.

385
00:18:22,121 --> 00:18:23,355
She went away.

386
00:18:24,424 --> 00:18:26,558
She turned the office
into a guest room,

387
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,161
so that my cousin
could stay with her.

388
00:18:29,163 --> 00:18:30,562
- Oh, nice.

389
00:18:30,564 --> 00:18:34,000
Yeah, but he's
obviously not here anymore, so.

390
00:18:34,002 --> 00:18:35,068
- Great. Perfect.

391
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,202
- Better, right?

392
00:18:36,204 --> 00:18:37,203
- Yeah, I love it.

393
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:39,272
- Yeah, it's way better.

394
00:19:19,548 --> 00:19:20,783
It's beautiful, huh?

395
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:21,684
- Hmm?

396
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:23,686
- The view.

397
00:19:28,358 --> 00:19:31,494
Still don't get
any reception, huh?

398
00:20:20,146 --> 00:20:22,181
Do you remember that guy, Ryan?

399
00:20:22,183 --> 00:20:24,751
The one whose short I did
that went to Sundance?

400
00:20:24,753 --> 00:20:26,453
Well, he sent me
this feature script

401
00:20:26,455 --> 00:20:28,655
he's been working on,

402
00:20:28,657 --> 00:20:31,224
and he really wanted me to
show it to this producer

403
00:20:31,226 --> 00:20:33,626
on that movie I shot last June.

404
00:20:33,628 --> 00:20:36,729
I guess he like really wants
to work with this one producer,

405
00:20:36,731 --> 00:20:39,265
and like, wanted me
to show it to him.

406
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:41,402
Oh, I left my shampoo in my bag.

407
00:20:41,404 --> 00:20:43,838
Do you mind grabbing it for me?

408
00:21:11,702 --> 00:21:13,336
Thanks.

409
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,670
- So, what did you tell him?

410
00:21:14,672 --> 00:21:17,874
Oh, so I told him that
i didn't have a chance.

411
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,775
Show the producers, you
know, and he was like,

412
00:21:19,777 --> 00:21:21,310
"what do you mean you
don't have a chance?

413
00:21:21,312 --> 00:21:22,912
"You've been on set all week."

414
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,448
And I was like, "yeah, but the
producers aren't even there

415
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,516
"every day."

416
00:21:28,418 --> 00:21:28,419
I don't know.

417
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,854
I just feel like he
expects so much from me,

418
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:34,758
and I, I'm just getting
my feet wet, you know?

419
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,260
- Wait, what?

420
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:37,427
- What?

421
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,363
You're in the united
Hollywood issue?

422
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:42,733
Why didn't you
tell me about this?

423
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:45,303
- Where did you get that?

424
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,704
- From your bag.

425
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,742
Why didn't you tell
me this happened?

426
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,344
- I don't know.

427
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,648
Do you think i
wouldn't find out?

428
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,852
I, I really didn't
think about it.

429
00:21:59,854 --> 00:22:01,620
- I mean, this is crazy.

430
00:22:01,622 --> 00:22:03,756
This is so cool.

431
00:22:03,758 --> 00:22:06,392
I can't believe you wouldn't
have mentioned this before.

432
00:22:06,394 --> 00:22:07,860
- I don't know.

433
00:22:07,862 --> 00:22:11,697
I really, really don't
think it's that big a deal.

434
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:13,832
- It's a really big deal.

435
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:16,337
- I'm sorry.

436
00:22:18,472 --> 00:22:19,739
You don't have
to apologize to me.

437
00:22:19,741 --> 00:22:22,375
You should just be more excited

438
00:22:22,377 --> 00:22:24,844
when things like this happen.

439
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,617
- No, you're right.

440
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:44,799
You hit him?

441
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:46,935
No, I mean,
i didn't hit him.

442
00:22:46,937 --> 00:22:48,503
I like shoved him.

443
00:22:49,706 --> 00:22:51,006
- But like, hard?

444
00:22:51,941 --> 00:22:53,875
- Uh, well, kind of.

445
00:22:57,413 --> 00:23:00,315
Okay, we were
standing at the bar,

446
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:02,751
and Josh was saying
something that I

447
00:23:02,753 --> 00:23:04,687
like really didn't agree with,

448
00:23:04,689 --> 00:23:05,245
and so I chimed in,

449
00:23:05,445 --> 00:23:06,285
but obviously, it was a bar,

450
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,891
so I started speaking
loudly, you know what I mean?

451
00:23:08,893 --> 00:23:09,892
- Right.

452
00:23:09,894 --> 00:23:11,527
Oh, I'm okay.

453
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:13,029
Um, do you want some of this,

454
00:23:13,031 --> 00:23:14,764
'cause it's really good.

455
00:23:14,766 --> 00:23:16,366
- No.

456
00:23:16,368 --> 00:23:17,567
- All right.

457
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:19,903
Are you really
not gonna have any?

458
00:23:19,905 --> 00:23:21,939
- Yeah, I mean, I'd like to,

459
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:24,675
but I just, I've been
sleeping so much better

460
00:23:24,677 --> 00:23:26,310
since I stopped.

461
00:23:26,312 --> 00:23:28,012
I know, but it's not
like you have to get up

462
00:23:28,014 --> 00:23:31,482
for an audition
tomorrow morning.

463
00:23:31,484 --> 00:23:32,816
Come on.

464
00:23:32,818 --> 00:23:34,351
- Okay, just a little bit.

465
00:23:34,353 --> 00:23:34,986
A little.

466
00:23:34,988 --> 00:23:35,887
- Okay.

467
00:23:35,889 --> 00:23:37,022
- A little bit...

468
00:23:37,024 --> 00:23:38,857
- these are very small glasses.

469
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:40,859
- That is not a little bit.

470
00:23:40,861 --> 00:23:43,561
Um, was Henry there?

471
00:23:43,563 --> 00:23:44,529
- Where?

472
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:45,530
What, at the bar?

473
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:45,332
- Yeah.

474
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:45,332
No, he was the one
who encouraged me

475
00:23:45,532 --> 00:23:50,670
to participate in the
conversation in the first place,

476
00:23:50,672 --> 00:23:52,772
and so I was doing that,
i was just joining in,

477
00:23:52,774 --> 00:23:54,540
and Josh was like,
oh, okay, just,

478
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,809
"first of all, can
you calm down?"

479
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:58,711
- That's so annoying.

480
00:23:58,713 --> 00:23:59,393
- Right?

481
00:23:59,748 --> 00:24:00,498
I mean, Jesus.

482
00:24:00,698 --> 00:24:03,482
If I was a boy, no one would
be telling me to calm down.

483
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,383
- True.

484
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,021
- Oh, come on, Beth.

485
00:24:08,023 --> 00:24:11,992
Has anyone ever told you
to calm down in your life?

486
00:24:11,994 --> 00:24:13,093
Exactly.

487
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,830
Anyways, yeah,

488
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:20,033
so I could feel myself
getting like really upset,

489
00:24:20,035 --> 00:24:21,968
but I stopped myself,
'cause I was like, no, no,

490
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,104
this is your
boyfriend's manager.

491
00:24:23,106 --> 00:24:24,739
You can't like,

492
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:26,974
so, I walked away, 'cause
i was about to cry,

493
00:24:26,976 --> 00:24:28,076
and,

494
00:24:29,645 --> 00:24:31,166
then he comes after me.

495
00:24:31,995 --> 00:24:32,754
- Josh did?

496
00:24:32,954 --> 00:24:35,883
Yes, and I'm
like, "Josh, listen.

497
00:24:35,885 --> 00:24:37,085
"I have a really bad temper.

498
00:24:37,087 --> 00:24:38,954
"I need you to give
me some space, okay?"

499
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,835
And he was like,
"yeah, yeah, yeah.

500
00:24:40,035 --> 00:24:41,657
"Okay, fine, but you know,
you don't have to walk away

501
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:42,958
"like a prima Donna."

502
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,593
- Oh my god.

503
00:24:44,595 --> 00:24:45,861
- Like, what?

504
00:24:45,863 --> 00:24:47,863
And he just kept saying
that, like prima Donna,

505
00:24:47,865 --> 00:24:49,932
prima Donna, prima Donna.

506
00:24:49,934 --> 00:24:51,066
- That is awful.

507
00:24:51,068 --> 00:24:52,634
- Yeah, and so, of course,

508
00:24:52,636 --> 00:24:55,772
I started like
hysterically crying,

509
00:24:55,774 --> 00:24:58,375
and I was so upset that yes,

510
00:24:59,877 --> 00:25:01,010
I pushed him.

511
00:25:04,014 --> 00:25:06,082
What? What would you do?

512
00:25:14,025 --> 00:25:18,129
You wouldn't get involved
in the first place.

513
00:25:25,704 --> 00:25:28,106
Just feel so out of control.

514
00:25:29,642 --> 00:25:30,842
- No.

515
00:25:30,844 --> 00:25:33,044
No, no, that's
really frustrating,

516
00:25:33,046 --> 00:25:35,046
what happened to you.

517
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:38,850
- Yeah.

518
00:25:43,157 --> 00:25:47,593
And now, Henry's shooting
a commercial in Singapore,

519
00:25:49,096 --> 00:25:51,831
and he's letting me stay at
the house until he gets back,

520
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:53,966
but after that, I'm like.

521
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:02,743
No, you know what?

522
00:26:04,846 --> 00:26:05,979
I don't know.

523
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,683
Henry's thinking was
like, career is important,

524
00:26:09,685 --> 00:26:10,984
but if you're in a relationship,

525
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,220
then you have to put
that first, right?

526
00:26:13,222 --> 00:26:16,090
But like I always knew that
i just wasn't gonna be happy

527
00:26:16,092 --> 00:26:19,127
unless I accomplish
certain things first.

528
00:26:19,205 --> 00:26:20,212
Like, if you want
to be an actress,

529
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,130
you have to establish
yourself before you're 30,

530
00:26:22,132 --> 00:26:24,065
or else, you're fucked.

531
00:26:24,067 --> 00:26:28,570
Plus, I really need to focus
on finding good representation.

532
00:26:28,572 --> 00:26:31,707
Especially, now,
before pilot season.

533
00:26:36,112 --> 00:26:40,549
God, you're so lucky to get
paid to do what you love.

534
00:26:43,587 --> 00:26:45,087
Yeah, I mean,
the stuff that I do

535
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:47,924
isn't exactly Gibson, you know?

536
00:26:50,561 --> 00:26:54,197
Yeah, but, I mean, it
beats waiting tables.

537
00:26:57,702 --> 00:27:01,572
I've spent so much
money on head shots

538
00:27:01,574 --> 00:27:04,642
and stupid fucking
invisible braces.

539
00:27:09,715 --> 00:27:10,948
Stop, I'm fine.

540
00:27:13,085 --> 00:27:15,052
Seriously, I feel good.

541
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:21,760
And hey, what the fuck?

542
00:27:21,762 --> 00:27:26,265
It will all be over soon
enough anyways, right?

543
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,797
- Give me the keys.

544
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:57,831
- Excuse me?

545
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:58,999
Give me
the keys, bitch.

546
00:27:59,164 --> 00:27:59,757
- Why?

547
00:27:59,957 --> 00:28:02,870
Because you almost
just killed us like five times.

548
00:28:02,872 --> 00:28:03,938
Come on.

549
00:28:14,051 --> 00:28:14,950
Sazerac,

550
00:28:16,652 --> 00:28:19,120
and speaking in tongues.

551
00:28:19,122 --> 00:28:20,755
- Thank you.

552
00:28:22,025 --> 00:28:23,159
- Here, no I can get us...
- no, no, no.

553
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:24,293
I got it.

554
00:28:24,295 --> 00:28:25,094
Can we keep it open?
- No, Beth.

555
00:28:25,096 --> 00:28:26,295
I can get my own drink...

556
00:28:26,297 --> 00:28:26,559
- I got it, I got it.

557
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:27,899
- I can pay for my own drink.

558
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:31,767
I know you can, but that
stupid beer commercial I did

559
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:34,971
is playing like a
hundred times a day,

560
00:28:35,144 --> 00:28:36,067
and I'm making a lot of money,

561
00:28:36,267 --> 00:28:39,309
and I want to buy my best
friend a drink, okay?

562
00:28:39,311 --> 00:28:40,877
- Okay, thank you.

563
00:28:43,314 --> 00:28:45,616
- Cheers.

564
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,320
Mmm.

565
00:28:50,322 --> 00:28:51,622
- Mmm.

566
00:28:53,892 --> 00:28:58,129
I know that I haven't been
the greatest friend lately.

567
00:28:59,765 --> 00:29:01,833
Oh, Jesus, you're
as drunk as I am.

568
00:29:01,835 --> 00:29:03,901
- No, I'm serious.

569
00:29:03,903 --> 00:29:05,870
I've been a bad friend.

570
00:29:06,972 --> 00:29:08,239
I mean, you broke
up with Henry, what,

571
00:29:08,241 --> 00:29:10,242
like two months ago, and
i just found out today?

572
00:29:10,244 --> 00:29:13,345
I really should have
been there for you.

573
00:29:13,347 --> 00:29:15,047
You must hate me.

574
00:29:17,217 --> 00:29:19,084
- I don't hate you.

575
00:29:21,187 --> 00:29:23,822
I really, I really
love you, Anna.

576
00:29:23,824 --> 00:29:25,425
You know that, right?

577
00:29:27,361 --> 00:29:31,931
And I'm really glad that we got
to have this weekend, alone.

578
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:34,100
I've really missed you.

579
00:29:34,102 --> 00:29:36,169
- Yeah, I miss you too.

580
00:29:36,171 --> 00:29:38,938
And I know that like,
a lot has changed,

581
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:43,878
and you're going through
some hard stuff right now,

582
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,747
but I just, I think
you should know

583
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:50,017
that I think you are
such a beautiful,

584
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:52,319
wonderful person,
and you are so,

585
00:29:52,321 --> 00:29:55,256
so, so talented, and I just know

586
00:29:55,258 --> 00:29:58,126
that everything's gonna be fine.

587
00:30:06,202 --> 00:30:07,202
What?

588
00:30:07,204 --> 00:30:08,470
- No, don't look.

589
00:30:21,752 --> 00:30:23,886
The situation's pretty
sticky over there.

590
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,289
The Chinese actually held
me for a couple of days

591
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:29,359
on my last visit,
and, my translator

592
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:34,998
sort of was a double agent,
and kinda got me out of it.

593
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,899
- How?

594
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:41,004
He just, sort of knew
what they wanted to hear.

595
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,440
- Um, cheers.

596
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:44,909
- Cheers.

597
00:30:44,911 --> 00:30:46,845
How did you get
the money over there?

598
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:49,481
- I delivered it in a suitcase.

599
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,016
- How much?

600
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:55,019
I think it
was about 50 grand.

601
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:57,522
- Oh my god, that's amazing.

602
00:30:57,524 --> 00:31:01,327
Well, it's,
it's not like I,

603
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:04,196
I don't know, I've done this
kind of thing my whole life.

604
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:07,166
I mean, you'll
see, you get older.

605
00:31:07,168 --> 00:31:08,334
- Oh, stop it, you're not old.

606
00:31:08,336 --> 00:31:09,335
- Really?

607
00:31:09,337 --> 00:31:10,503
How old do you think I am?

608
00:31:10,505 --> 00:31:11,470
- I don't know.

609
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,439
20.

610
00:31:14,442 --> 00:31:15,474
- I'm 48.

611
00:31:15,476 --> 00:31:18,478
- 48, you're a young boy.

612
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,281
Please, I could
be your father.

613
00:31:22,483 --> 00:31:24,117
Well, I like men
with a little salt

614
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,252
and pepper in his hair.

615
00:31:25,254 --> 00:31:26,153
- Really?

616
00:31:34,863 --> 00:31:39,300
Um, okay, well is that
like what you're doing here,

617
00:31:39,302 --> 00:31:42,403
or is there a zendo
around here or something?

618
00:31:42,405 --> 00:31:45,439
Uh, well, tibetans
don't practice zen.

619
00:31:45,441 --> 00:31:48,811
They belong to the
mahayana school.

620
00:31:49,546 --> 00:31:51,113
Why? Do you practice zen?

621
00:31:51,115 --> 00:31:53,182
- No, my ex had a phase.

622
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,551
- Oh.

623
00:31:55,553 --> 00:31:56,852
Well, there is a zendo here.

624
00:31:56,854 --> 00:31:59,555
It's, oh actually,
it's a monastery.

625
00:31:59,557 --> 00:32:01,089
Tassajara, but,

626
00:32:03,092 --> 00:32:07,297
I'm actually here for a
men's retreat at esalen.

627
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:10,433
I know
what goes on there?

628
00:32:10,435 --> 00:32:11,534
- You do? What?

629
00:32:12,937 --> 00:32:15,305
That's where you guys
like sit around a fire,

630
00:32:15,307 --> 00:32:18,007
and like, bang drums, and thump
your chest, and everything,

631
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:19,509
right?

632
00:32:19,511 --> 00:32:21,912
Well, we do a little of
that, if stuff comes up.

633
00:32:21,914 --> 00:32:24,181
- Stuff? If like stuff comes up?

634
00:32:24,183 --> 00:32:25,015
What sort of stuff?

635
00:32:25,017 --> 00:32:26,150
- Well, I don't know.

636
00:32:27,553 --> 00:32:28,485
Competition.

637
00:32:28,487 --> 00:32:29,486
- Competition?

638
00:32:29,488 --> 00:32:30,521
What does that mean?

639
00:32:30,523 --> 00:32:31,522
Like, what?

640
00:32:31,524 --> 00:32:32,957
What sort of competition?

641
00:32:33,157 --> 00:32:35,076
You should check out
tassajara while you're here,

642
00:32:35,276 --> 00:32:37,195
and maybe, spend a few
days in silent meditation.

643
00:32:37,197 --> 00:32:39,865
Shut up,
I'm just asking.

644
00:32:39,867 --> 00:32:42,100
- Is she always like this?

645
00:32:43,135 --> 00:32:44,402
- Excuse me.

646
00:32:44,404 --> 00:32:47,272
Your friend, is
she always so, um.

647
00:32:48,242 --> 00:32:49,241
- So what?

648
00:32:49,243 --> 00:32:50,242
- Curious?

649
00:32:50,244 --> 00:32:51,443
- So curious?

650
00:32:51,445 --> 00:32:54,113
I don't think that's
what you were gonna say.

651
00:32:54,115 --> 00:32:57,583
No, no, it's just
you're very inquisitive.

652
00:32:57,585 --> 00:33:00,453
I mean, I think
this is interesting.

653
00:33:00,455 --> 00:33:02,622
You are in a group
with a bunch of guys

654
00:33:02,624 --> 00:33:05,391
that if they get jealous
of you, you wrestle them.

655
00:33:05,393 --> 00:33:06,359
Like, what?

656
00:33:08,496 --> 00:33:10,898
Can I get
some help over here?

657
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,166
- Oh, come on.

658
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:13,884
You can't handle just like
a couple of questions.

659
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:15,602
If I was in a woman's
group, you wouldn't be like,

660
00:33:15,604 --> 00:33:18,972
hey, that's something I'd like
to know a little more about?

661
00:33:18,974 --> 00:33:20,674
Will you excuse
me for just a sec.

662
00:33:20,676 --> 00:33:22,109
- Yeah.

663
00:33:32,454 --> 00:33:34,555
I should, I should
probably get going.

664
00:33:34,557 --> 00:33:36,991
I have gotta get up at the
ass crack of dawn tomorrow

665
00:33:36,993 --> 00:33:39,628
for a men's hike,
but, excuse me.

666
00:33:42,532 --> 00:33:44,366
I am taking off.

667
00:33:44,368 --> 00:33:46,235
I'd like to buy this
young lady a drink.

668
00:33:46,237 --> 00:33:48,070
What were you drinking?

669
00:33:48,072 --> 00:33:49,505
Uh, I guess I'll
get another sazerac.

670
00:33:49,507 --> 00:33:53,676
Sazerac, and
what was Beth drinking?

671
00:33:53,678 --> 00:33:55,345
I can't remember.

672
00:33:55,347 --> 00:33:58,581
Uh, it was like a
speaking in tongues.

673
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:01,217
- Speaking in tongues,

674
00:34:01,219 --> 00:34:02,218
and a speaking in tongues.

675
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,186
That should be plenty.

676
00:34:03,188 --> 00:34:04,087
Thank you.

677
00:34:05,556 --> 00:34:06,990
But, it's really
nice meeting you.

678
00:34:06,992 --> 00:34:07,691
- Mm-hmm.

679
00:34:10,561 --> 00:34:11,729
Anna.
- Anna.

680
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:14,332
I'm sorry.

681
00:34:14,334 --> 00:34:16,734
Very nice to meet you, Anna.

682
00:34:18,103 --> 00:34:20,071
- Yeah, go, warm up.

683
00:34:22,608 --> 00:34:23,574
- Good night.

684
00:34:23,576 --> 00:34:25,443
- Bye.

685
00:34:40,493 --> 00:34:41,593
- Hey, it's me.

686
00:34:41,595 --> 00:34:43,596
I'm just checking in.

687
00:34:45,766 --> 00:34:47,200
You're asleep.

688
00:34:47,202 --> 00:34:52,672
Anyway, I wanted to tell you
that I really, really love you,

689
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:53,773
and I miss you.

690
00:34:55,709 --> 00:34:58,644
There's no reception at the
house, so if I don't answer,

691
00:34:58,646 --> 00:35:01,181
that's why, but I love you.

692
00:35:03,151 --> 00:35:04,051
Okay.

693
00:35:04,786 --> 00:35:06,720
I love you.

694
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:07,621
Bye.

695
00:35:32,215 --> 00:35:34,050
- Hey, you.

696
00:35:34,052 --> 00:35:35,651
I was wondering where
you snuck off to.

697
00:35:35,653 --> 00:35:38,387
- Oh, I was just making a call.

698
00:35:38,389 --> 00:35:40,122
The reception
really sucks out here.

699
00:35:40,124 --> 00:35:41,190
- Yeah.

700
00:35:41,192 --> 00:35:42,792
- It's the mountains.

701
00:35:44,795 --> 00:35:47,731
Listen, I was wondering
if, I don't know,

702
00:35:47,733 --> 00:35:52,269
would you be interested in
maybe getting a drink sometime?

703
00:35:52,271 --> 00:35:53,537
- Oh, uh.

704
00:35:53,539 --> 00:35:55,672
I mean, I'm here with my friend.

705
00:35:55,674 --> 00:35:57,841
- No, I mean, back in la.

706
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:00,777
- Oh, right. Obviously.

707
00:36:02,714 --> 00:36:04,715
Or, we could,
we can get dinner.

708
00:36:04,717 --> 00:36:06,684
I have, a friend of mine, bill,

709
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:08,486
they just opened up this
place, in abakany, that,

710
00:36:08,488 --> 00:36:12,390
it's nice, the chef's
kaiser michelin star.

711
00:36:12,392 --> 00:36:14,859
Um, how would next Friday work?

712
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:17,728
- Um.

713
00:36:18,665 --> 00:36:19,832
Sure.

714
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:21,567
- Okay.

715
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:24,803
Um, can I get your number?

716
00:36:24,805 --> 00:36:26,839
- Oh, yeah.

717
00:38:48,857 --> 00:38:49,757
Morning.

718
00:39:04,307 --> 00:39:05,507
- What's that?

719
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,976
Oh, it's just
this stupid script.

720
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,278
So stupid.

721
00:39:10,947 --> 00:39:11,598
- What is it?

722
00:39:11,798 --> 00:39:12,449
- It's this,

723
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,586
it's just a really
dumb horror movie.

724
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:17,954
- Another one?

725
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:19,055
- Yeah, I know.

726
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,293
This one is especially stupid.

727
00:39:23,295 --> 00:39:25,361
It's embarrassing.

728
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,896
- What's it about?

729
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:27,997
- Um,

730
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:30,534
it's nothing.

731
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:33,771
It's just, um.

732
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:37,441
- It's about nothing?

733
00:39:37,443 --> 00:39:38,876
- It's about stones.

734
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:42,946
It's set in Iceland, where,
i guess, they have this

735
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:46,818
whole mythology where
stones turn into trolls,

736
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:51,056
but it's a red herring,
because it's a serial killer,

737
00:39:51,991 --> 00:39:55,427
only you think it's
trolls for a while.

738
00:39:56,495 --> 00:39:58,897
This is something
Adele gave you?

739
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:00,398
- Um, it's, yeah.

740
00:40:01,835 --> 00:40:04,737
I mean, it's really terrible.

741
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:07,807
Okay, but, she
wants you to do it?

742
00:40:11,545 --> 00:40:12,678
- I think so.

743
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:15,781
- Why?

744
00:40:15,783 --> 00:40:17,451
- Um, I don't know.

745
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:19,753
It's bigger.

746
00:40:19,755 --> 00:40:21,655
Yeah, but why
does she want you to do it?

747
00:40:21,657 --> 00:40:24,891
I guess, because
I'm in every scene.

748
00:40:28,096 --> 00:40:29,496
- It's the lead?

749
00:40:30,465 --> 00:40:31,732
- I guess.

750
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:34,001
I mean, yeah, yeah.

751
00:40:34,003 --> 00:40:36,571
Also, also, it's against type.

752
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:40,074
What's your type?

753
00:40:40,076 --> 00:40:42,009
- I don't know.

754
00:40:42,011 --> 00:40:45,146
What, like the
wilting flower type?

755
00:40:47,116 --> 00:40:48,015
- I guess.

756
00:40:50,854 --> 00:40:52,654
- And what's this?

757
00:40:52,656 --> 00:40:54,056
- Uh,

758
00:40:54,058 --> 00:40:56,091
I don't know, like
sassy, I guess.

759
00:40:56,093 --> 00:40:57,593
It's really so bad.

760
00:40:57,595 --> 00:40:57,793
It's so bad.

761
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:02,631
You have to take
your clothes off?

762
00:41:02,633 --> 00:41:04,533
- What do you think?

763
00:41:04,535 --> 00:41:05,935
- Jesus, again.

764
00:41:05,937 --> 00:41:07,470
- I know.

765
00:41:07,472 --> 00:41:11,107
I know, it's like the
tenth time in two years.

766
00:41:15,746 --> 00:41:18,415
- You ever feel like a whore?

767
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:20,750
- Um.

768
00:41:23,822 --> 00:41:27,425
I don't know, yeah,
sometimes, a little.

769
00:41:32,063 --> 00:41:33,431
I wanted to tell you,

770
00:41:33,433 --> 00:41:36,567
I sent the link to
your reel, to Adele.

771
00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:37,702
- You did?

772
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,871
When did you send it?

773
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:43,175
Um, I don't know,
like a while ago.

774
00:41:43,177 --> 00:41:44,142
- Like what?

775
00:41:44,144 --> 00:41:45,610
Like, a month ago?

776
00:41:45,612 --> 00:41:48,013
- Yeah, maybe two weeks ago.

777
00:41:49,615 --> 00:41:51,483
I don't know why you want
to work with her, though.

778
00:41:51,485 --> 00:41:55,121
I mean, they send me
out on the worst stuff.

779
00:41:55,123 --> 00:41:59,826
It must be nice not
being all alone, though.

780
00:41:59,828 --> 00:42:01,127
Like to have somebody
besides yourself

781
00:42:01,129 --> 00:42:03,196
invested in your career.

782
00:42:04,798 --> 00:42:08,669
I mean, yeah, I guess,
when you put it that way.

783
00:42:08,671 --> 00:42:11,672
What other way
is there to put it?

784
00:42:15,877 --> 00:42:17,911
You want to run it?

785
00:42:18,111 --> 00:42:18,455
- What, this?

786
00:42:18,655 --> 00:42:20,547
No, let's do some other
script we were talking about.

787
00:42:20,549 --> 00:42:22,483
- No, not really.

788
00:42:22,485 --> 00:42:23,984
- Maybe I can help.

789
00:42:23,986 --> 00:42:24,986
There's really no point.

790
00:42:24,988 --> 00:42:27,856
I'm totally wrong for it.

791
00:42:27,858 --> 00:42:29,090
- Come on.

792
00:42:29,092 --> 00:42:30,525
It'll be fun.

793
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:33,561
We never get to act
together anymore.

794
00:42:33,563 --> 00:42:34,262
Okay.

795
00:42:35,831 --> 00:42:39,267
I think it's time we started
to think outside the box.

796
00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:41,203
- Outside the box?

797
00:42:41,365 --> 00:42:41,448
- Yeah.

798
00:42:41,648 --> 00:42:44,874
I've never even
understood what that means.

799
00:42:44,876 --> 00:42:46,108
- Outside the box?

800
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,143
It means to like think
in a different way.

801
00:42:48,343 --> 00:42:48,760
- Really?

802
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,214
This isn't the time
for sarcasm, sharlene.

803
00:42:52,216 --> 00:42:54,149
We're stuck out here in the
middle of the arctic tundra,

804
00:42:54,151 --> 00:42:56,085
freezing our asses off.

805
00:42:56,087 --> 00:42:57,554
Our thermos is almost empty.

806
00:42:57,556 --> 00:42:58,955
I've had to pee
for like six hours,

807
00:42:59,155 --> 00:42:59,645
but I'm afraid to go,

808
00:42:59,845 --> 00:43:02,092
because I think the pee
might freeze inside my dick.

809
00:43:02,094 --> 00:43:03,093
- You have a dick?

810
00:43:03,095 --> 00:43:05,529
I thought you were a dick.

811
00:43:07,632 --> 00:43:08,532
- Really?

812
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:12,303
That's how you're
gonna say the line?

813
00:43:12,305 --> 00:43:16,240
Jesus, Beth, no wonder
you keep getting typecast.

814
00:43:16,242 --> 00:43:17,542
You're supposed to
be sassy, right?

815
00:43:17,544 --> 00:43:19,043
So, be sassy.

816
00:43:19,045 --> 00:43:20,278
- I don't even want the part.

817
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,279
- Oh, bullshit.

818
00:43:21,281 --> 00:43:23,614
Just be fucking sassy.

819
00:43:23,616 --> 00:43:24,682
What the fuck? It's easy.

820
00:43:24,684 --> 00:43:26,317
Here, you be the guy.

821
00:43:30,256 --> 00:43:33,592
I think it's time we started
to think outside the box.

822
00:43:33,594 --> 00:43:34,826
- Outside the box?

823
00:43:34,828 --> 00:43:36,194
- Yep.

824
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:38,730
I've never even
understood what that means.

825
00:43:38,732 --> 00:43:39,965
- Outside the box.

826
00:43:39,967 --> 00:43:41,300
It means like to think
in a different way.

827
00:43:41,302 --> 00:43:42,668
- Oh, really?

828
00:43:45,139 --> 00:43:47,273
This isn't the time
for sarcasm, sharlene.

829
00:43:47,275 --> 00:43:49,275
We're stuck out here in the
middle of the arctic tundra,

830
00:43:49,277 --> 00:43:51,244
freezing our asses off.

831
00:43:52,146 --> 00:43:53,713
Our thermos is almost empty.

832
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:55,281
I've had to pee
for like six hours,

833
00:43:55,481 --> 00:43:55,931
but I'm afraid to go,

834
00:43:56,131 --> 00:43:58,851
because I think the pee
might freeze inside my dick.

835
00:43:58,853 --> 00:43:59,987
- Oh, you have a dick?

836
00:43:59,989 --> 00:44:02,656
I thought you just were a dick.

837
00:44:02,658 --> 00:44:04,091
- Is that helpful?

838
00:44:04,093 --> 00:44:06,727
Was it helpful when
you dragged me out here

839
00:44:06,729 --> 00:44:09,096
on this so-called adventure?

840
00:44:09,098 --> 00:44:10,230
Was it helpful when
you ate all the food,

841
00:44:10,232 --> 00:44:13,601
like a fucking pig,
four hours ago?

842
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:17,706
- I offered you a bite.

843
00:44:20,009 --> 00:44:22,243
- You're a fucking retard.

844
00:44:25,081 --> 00:44:26,281
- That's not PC.

845
00:44:27,383 --> 00:44:30,285
You think I give
a shit about PC?

846
00:44:32,122 --> 00:44:34,256
We're gonna die out here.

847
00:44:34,258 --> 00:44:37,159
Do you get that,
you piece of shit?

848
00:44:37,161 --> 00:44:41,230
We're going to die, and
it's your fucking fault!

849
00:44:42,866 --> 00:44:44,300
You're life is over.

850
00:44:44,302 --> 00:44:46,035
My life is over.

851
00:44:46,037 --> 00:44:47,904
We are gonna freeze
to fucking death

852
00:44:47,906 --> 00:44:50,007
in the fucking freezing tundra,

853
00:44:50,009 --> 00:44:52,409
and it's your fucking fault!

854
00:44:58,383 --> 00:45:00,817
That's how you play sassy.

855
00:45:05,257 --> 00:45:06,991
Let's go for a hike.

856
00:45:38,727 --> 00:45:40,694
Is that Matt Dickinson?

857
00:45:43,264 --> 00:45:44,364
- Hey.

858
00:45:45,433 --> 00:45:47,067
- Hi.
- - Hi, how are you?

859
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,592
- Good, how are you?

860
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:51,405
I was wondering if i
was gonna bump into you guys.

861
00:45:51,407 --> 00:45:52,440
- What?

862
00:45:52,442 --> 00:45:54,275
What are you doing here?

863
00:45:54,277 --> 00:45:56,977
- You didn't tell her?

864
00:45:56,979 --> 00:45:58,879
Am I that unmemorable?

865
00:46:00,348 --> 00:46:02,983
No, I just bumped
into Beth at capecita,

866
00:46:02,985 --> 00:46:04,385
and mentioned i
was coming up here.

867
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:05,486
- Oh.

868
00:46:06,321 --> 00:46:09,424
No, she didn't
mention that at all.

869
00:46:09,426 --> 00:46:11,126
What are you doing here?

870
00:46:11,128 --> 00:46:14,429
Uh, well, I'm hiking, but
I'm also location scouting

871
00:46:14,431 --> 00:46:16,898
for this experimental
short I'm doing.

872
00:46:17,098 --> 00:46:17,326
- Oh.

873
00:46:17,526 --> 00:46:19,468
I was telling Beth that
i wanted to talk to you

874
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,737
about maybe being in it.

875
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:24,373
- Oh.

876
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:25,374
Uh, cool.

877
00:46:25,376 --> 00:46:26,409
- Yeah, yeah.

878
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:29,178
It's super low budget, but,

879
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,181
you really didn't mention this?

880
00:46:31,381 --> 00:46:33,382
Yeah, what are
you trying to do?

881
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,518
Keep me from getting
cast in things?

882
00:46:36,386 --> 00:46:37,386
You should just cast Beth.

883
00:46:37,388 --> 00:46:38,421
Everyone else does.

884
00:46:38,423 --> 00:46:39,423
- Oh, yeah.

885
00:46:39,425 --> 00:46:40,858
I know, right?

886
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:41,825
Beth's way too big
time for us now.

887
00:46:43,796 --> 00:46:46,163
Yep, well, anyways,
thanks for thinking of me.

888
00:46:46,165 --> 00:46:47,197
That's awesome.

889
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:48,398
- Yeah, no.

890
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,167
Figured, I don't know,
it'd be something

891
00:46:50,169 --> 00:46:52,169
that you'd be up for.

892
00:46:52,171 --> 00:46:52,579
- Yeah.

893
00:46:52,779 --> 00:46:53,187
- Mm-hmm.

894
00:46:53,387 --> 00:46:55,440
Paul said he saw
your last short online,

895
00:46:55,442 --> 00:46:57,442
and it was interesting.

896
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:00,345
You're really lucky.

897
00:47:04,016 --> 00:47:06,217
Have you been to
big sur bakery yet?

898
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:08,119
No, do
they have cookies.

899
00:47:08,121 --> 00:47:09,487
Uh, yeah, they have
really good cookies.

900
00:47:09,489 --> 00:47:11,190
They also have
really good dinner.

901
00:47:11,192 --> 00:47:12,224
- Awesome.

902
00:47:12,226 --> 00:47:13,292
Yeah, I'll have to try that.

903
00:47:13,294 --> 00:47:14,460
- Where are you staying?

904
00:47:14,462 --> 00:47:16,295
This
really fancy place,

905
00:47:16,297 --> 00:47:17,830
super in the middle of nowhere.

906
00:47:17,832 --> 00:47:18,898
Just opened up.

907
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,166
- Oh, what's it called?

908
00:47:20,168 --> 00:47:21,400
It's called
a tent in the woods.

909
00:47:23,538 --> 00:47:25,137
What about you all?

910
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:26,907
I'm staying at
my aunt's house.

911
00:47:26,909 --> 00:47:28,809
It's, do you know
the area at all?

912
00:47:28,811 --> 00:47:30,310
- Yeah.

913
00:47:30,312 --> 00:47:33,113
Okay, it's just off the
road, near big sur station.

914
00:47:33,115 --> 00:47:35,582
- Oh, pfeiffer Ridge?

915
00:47:35,584 --> 00:47:36,950
- Yeah.

916
00:47:36,952 --> 00:47:38,819
Well, sycamore canyon,
but yeah, yeah.

917
00:47:38,821 --> 00:47:40,353
You do know the area.

918
00:47:40,355 --> 00:47:42,890
Can I talk to
you for a second?

919
00:47:42,892 --> 00:47:43,591
- Uh, now?

920
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,459
- Yeah.

921
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:48,529
- Okay.

922
00:47:52,501 --> 00:47:54,502
Um, well, I guess I have to go.

923
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:55,503
- Is she okay?

924
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:57,071
- Yeah.

925
00:47:57,073 --> 00:47:59,608
I mean, I'm sure she'll be fine.

926
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:02,845
- Okay.

927
00:48:02,847 --> 00:48:06,148
Yeah, well, I'll
give you a call.

928
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:07,416
Think I have your number.

929
00:48:07,616 --> 00:48:07,716
- Yeah.

930
00:48:07,916 --> 00:48:09,585
I mean, I know we're
Facebook friends, so...

931
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:10,986
- Right.

932
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,588
So, if I don't have
your number, I'll just...

933
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,557
- yeah, right. Yeah.

934
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:15,892
I'm really sorry about her...

935
00:48:15,894 --> 00:48:17,093
- oh, no. Of course.

936
00:48:17,095 --> 00:48:18,361
Go, go, go.
- Okay, bye.

937
00:48:18,363 --> 00:48:19,495
- Bye.

938
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:46,658
- What is it?

939
00:48:48,594 --> 00:48:49,661
- It's just.

940
00:48:53,933 --> 00:48:55,400
- What?

941
00:48:55,402 --> 00:48:59,170
I just never seen someone
look at me with so much disgust?

942
00:49:02,276 --> 00:49:06,112
I just, I just realized
how much you hate me,

943
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:11,584
and I, I feel really sad
about our friendship.

944
00:49:59,569 --> 00:50:02,538
- Hey, you all right?

945
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,706
- Yeah. Yeah.

946
00:50:04,975 --> 00:50:06,142
- You sure?
- Yeah.

947
00:50:06,144 --> 00:50:07,711
- You don't want a lift?

948
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:10,613
- No, I'm not going that far.

949
00:50:10,615 --> 00:50:11,514
I'm fine.

950
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:13,583
I'm not
gonna do anything.

951
00:50:13,585 --> 00:50:14,684
I'm just trying to be nice.

952
00:50:14,686 --> 00:50:16,619
Where you going?

953
00:50:16,621 --> 00:50:17,721
- Um.

954
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,691
Sycamore canyon.

955
00:50:21,693 --> 00:50:23,728
- That's not close.

956
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:27,064
That's five miles down the road.

957
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:30,234
Come on, it's gonna get cold.

958
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:31,135
Come on.

959
00:50:32,671 --> 00:50:33,771
Hey, it's okay.

960
00:51:14,649 --> 00:51:16,316
Nice place.

961
00:51:48,718 --> 00:51:49,852
- Hello, hello.

962
00:51:51,254 --> 00:51:52,321
- Hello.

963
00:51:52,323 --> 00:51:53,556
- Hello. Paul?

964
00:51:55,592 --> 00:51:56,559
Yes, yes.

965
00:51:56,561 --> 00:51:57,761
Can you hear me?

966
00:52:00,198 --> 00:52:01,698
Can you hear me?

967
00:52:03,302 --> 00:52:04,601
Paul.

968
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:06,176
Hold on.

969
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:08,371
I'm gonna call you back
from the land line, okay?

970
00:52:08,373 --> 00:52:10,707
Please, don't go anywhere.

971
00:52:24,389 --> 00:52:26,124
This weekend's a
fucking disaster.

972
00:52:26,126 --> 00:52:27,758
Honey, can you speak up?

973
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,530
No, I am telling you,
she fucking hates me.

974
00:52:31,532 --> 00:52:33,665
She thinks that I have
this like amazing career,

975
00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:36,168
and that I purposely
fucked her over.

976
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:37,402
Beth, can you speak up?

977
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,637
- No, I can't speak up.

978
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:40,539
I don't know if
she's here or not.

979
00:52:40,739 --> 00:52:41,087
I can't hear you.

980
00:52:41,287 --> 00:52:44,376
Uh, she thinks I fucked
her over on purpose.

981
00:52:44,378 --> 00:52:46,579
Why does
she think you fucked her over?

982
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:49,849
Because I didn't tell
her about Matt's thing.

983
00:52:49,851 --> 00:52:50,850
- What thing?

984
00:52:50,852 --> 00:52:52,819
- The thing. The short.

985
00:52:52,821 --> 00:52:55,321
Matt's thing, Matt's short film.

986
00:52:55,323 --> 00:52:57,290
- What?

987
00:52:58,492 --> 00:52:59,792
- It doesn't matter.

988
00:52:59,794 --> 00:53:01,829
It's mainly the
thing with Adele.

989
00:53:01,831 --> 00:53:03,497
What thing with Adele?

990
00:53:03,499 --> 00:53:06,767
Oh my god, do you even listen
to me when I talk to you?

991
00:53:06,769 --> 00:53:08,702
She wanted me to
send Adele her reel?

992
00:53:08,704 --> 00:53:10,538
Don't you remember
me telling you that?

993
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,529
- Right, yeah.

994
00:53:11,729 --> 00:53:12,666
You thought it was too soon.

995
00:53:12,866 --> 00:53:14,742
Exactly, and I was
going to send it,

996
00:53:14,744 --> 00:53:17,913
but I had only been with
Adele for like three months,

997
00:53:17,915 --> 00:53:19,581
and she wanted me to
send Adele the link

998
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:23,485
to her awful fucking website,
and I was going to do it,

999
00:53:23,487 --> 00:53:25,820
but then she got so crazy
and intense about it,

1000
00:53:25,822 --> 00:53:28,757
so then, I just told
her that I had sent it.

1001
00:53:28,759 --> 00:53:29,925
I
really don't understand

1002
00:53:29,927 --> 00:53:32,360
why you do stuff like that.

1003
00:53:32,362 --> 00:53:34,630
- I was going to send it.

1004
00:53:34,632 --> 00:53:36,365
Yeah, well, why lie?

1005
00:53:36,367 --> 00:53:38,334
Could you not give me
the third degree right now?

1006
00:53:38,336 --> 00:53:41,637
I am telling you, she's acting
completely fucking crazy.

1007
00:53:41,639 --> 00:53:42,638
You
sure you don't want me

1008
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,873
to come up there and get you?

1009
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:44,774
- No. No.

1010
00:53:44,776 --> 00:53:47,777
I'll just check into
a hotel or something.

1011
00:53:47,779 --> 00:53:50,714
I just, this is all because
i got cast in a couple

1012
00:53:50,716 --> 00:53:52,916
of terrible fucking movies
that I didn't even want

1013
00:53:52,918 --> 00:53:54,851
to be in in the first place.

1014
00:53:54,853 --> 00:53:55,886
Let me come get you.

1015
00:53:55,888 --> 00:53:57,487
- No.

1016
00:53:57,489 --> 00:53:58,655
I'll come
get you after my meeting.

1017
00:53:58,657 --> 00:53:59,990
- I just.

1018
00:53:59,992 --> 00:54:03,627
Why can't she just
be happy for me?

1019
00:54:03,629 --> 00:54:06,831
I just am trying so
hard to be nice to her,

1020
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:10,401
even though she's so
disgusting and desperate.

1021
00:54:10,403 --> 00:54:13,404
I mean, she knows that i
think she's a better actress

1022
00:54:13,406 --> 00:54:14,305
than I am.

1023
00:54:14,307 --> 00:54:16,841
I just happen to have
a fucking certain look

1024
00:54:16,843 --> 00:54:19,811
that people like right now.

1025
00:54:19,813 --> 00:54:21,814
- Beth.

1026
00:54:22,916 --> 00:54:24,850
- I have to go.

1027
00:54:28,689 --> 00:54:31,957
You think I'm
desperate and disgusting?

1028
00:54:32,892 --> 00:54:34,960
You're fucking pathetic.

1029
00:54:36,998 --> 00:54:40,000
Jesus, you act so
fucking innocent.

1030
00:54:42,336 --> 00:54:43,637
But you're not.

1031
00:54:44,705 --> 00:54:47,607
I mean, you're a
fucking liar, right?

1032
00:54:47,609 --> 00:54:49,676
Tell me, does it get
tiring just pretending

1033
00:54:49,678 --> 00:54:52,980
to be so fucking
helpless all the time?

1034
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:58,019
God, you think you're
so much better than me.

1035
00:54:58,021 --> 00:54:59,720
You're not.

1036
00:55:03,659 --> 00:55:06,694
You're a fucking phony,
and a narcissist,

1037
00:55:06,696 --> 00:55:09,498
and a horrible fucking friend.

1038
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,766
You can't even
help me get a part

1039
00:55:10,768 --> 00:55:13,435
in a fucking avant-garde short?

1040
00:55:16,873 --> 00:55:18,407
What?

1041
00:55:18,409 --> 00:55:19,708
Yes, cry, Beth.

1042
00:55:20,509 --> 00:55:20,510
Cry.

1043
00:55:22,045 --> 00:55:24,647
Fake fucking crocodile tears.

1044
00:55:24,649 --> 00:55:26,082
You fake fucking Hollywood cunt.

1045
00:56:22,542 --> 00:56:25,010
- Hey, sweetheart, it's me.

1046
00:56:25,012 --> 00:56:27,046
I'm on my way up.

1047
00:56:27,048 --> 00:56:30,884
I have no idea
where I'm going, so,

1048
00:56:30,886 --> 00:56:33,086
can you please call me back?

1049
01:01:56,464 --> 01:01:58,932
- Just whenever you're ready.

1050
01:02:02,404 --> 01:02:03,838
This is my second
day in big sur,

1051
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,873
and I'm standing there
with this like woman

1052
01:02:05,875 --> 01:02:07,441
who wants to make
sure that the death

1053
01:02:07,443 --> 01:02:10,511
of her like chihuahua
has been avenged.

1054
01:02:12,514 --> 01:02:14,281
You want a refill?

1055
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:17,384
- No, I'm okay. Thank you.

1056
01:02:18,254 --> 01:02:19,488
Um, no, I just.

1057
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:21,156
I shouldn't, i
don't really drink.

1058
01:02:21,158 --> 01:02:22,390
- What are you talking about?

1059
01:02:22,392 --> 01:02:23,458
You have, you just
had a cocktail.

1060
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:24,760
- Yes.

1061
01:02:26,229 --> 01:02:29,331
Um, I just won't be able
to sleep if I have more

1062
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:30,432
than one.

1063
01:02:33,837 --> 01:02:36,205
You think I'm trying
to get you drunk?

1064
01:02:36,207 --> 01:02:37,440
I'm not trying to get you drunk.

1065
01:02:37,442 --> 01:02:38,775
I took a vow of
celibacy for the month,

1066
01:02:38,777 --> 01:02:41,844
so you're totally safe with me.

1067
01:02:41,846 --> 01:02:45,782
Seriously, no sex, no
masturbation, nothing.

1068
01:02:47,184 --> 01:02:49,418
I'm basically like a monk.

1069
01:02:50,522 --> 01:02:52,256
I'm not trying to, I'm sorry.

1070
01:02:52,258 --> 01:02:55,959
I don't mean to be pushy, I'm
just enjoying talking to you.

1071
01:02:58,897 --> 01:03:00,030
Well, do you want
to keep hanging out?

1072
01:03:00,032 --> 01:03:01,532
I have, um,

1073
01:03:01,534 --> 01:03:03,167
I close out in 30 minutes.

1074
01:03:03,169 --> 01:03:04,935
I was thinking, maybe
you want to go swimming.

1075
01:03:04,937 --> 01:03:07,405
I know a place we could
go night swimming.

1076
01:03:07,407 --> 01:03:08,306
- Oh.

1077
01:03:09,475 --> 01:03:11,843
Remember,
this is like a monk.

1078
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:14,512
- Shut up.

1079
01:04:16,981 --> 01:04:18,180
- Get up.

1080
01:04:19,917 --> 01:04:23,118
Get up, I want to
show you something.

1081
01:04:41,573 --> 01:04:43,007
Wait, stay still.

1082
01:04:43,009 --> 01:04:44,041
What are you doing?

1083
01:04:44,043 --> 01:04:46,076
You gotta give me a pose.

1084
01:04:46,078 --> 01:04:49,413
First of all, you can't be
moving around like that.

1085
01:04:49,415 --> 01:04:51,015
You can't be moving
around like that.

1086
01:04:51,017 --> 01:04:53,183
You gotta give me a pose.

1087
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:57,255
That's the pose
you're gonna give me?

1088
01:04:57,257 --> 01:04:58,690
That is not a pose.

1089
01:04:59,692 --> 01:05:00,692
What's the matter?

1090
01:05:00,694 --> 01:05:02,627
Are you feeling self conscious?

1091
01:05:02,629 --> 01:05:04,029
Stay. Like this.

1092
01:05:05,031 --> 01:05:06,564
This is great.

1093
01:05:06,566 --> 01:05:09,567
Just like that, stay like that.

1094
01:05:09,569 --> 01:05:10,435
Oh, yes.

1095
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:14,006
You look like an angel.

1096
01:05:33,261 --> 01:05:34,428
So, you're an actor.

1097
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:35,495
That's cool.

1098
01:05:40,335 --> 01:05:42,536
Well, the stuff I do
is not exactly

1099
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:43,437
you know?

1100
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,441
- I actually don't,

1101
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:49,110
'cause I don't
know what that is.

1102
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:52,547
You have any like gigs
coming up, or anything?

1103
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:54,449
Anything interesting?

1104
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:55,350
- No.

1105
01:05:56,518 --> 01:05:58,386
- Really?
- No, nothing.

1106
01:05:58,388 --> 01:06:01,724
It seems
like maybe you do.

1107
01:06:01,726 --> 01:06:04,493
- I there's this stupid movie.

1108
01:06:05,762 --> 01:06:07,296
It's so stupid.

1109
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:11,166
- What's it called?

1110
01:06:11,768 --> 01:06:14,103
- It's called the stones.

1111
01:06:14,105 --> 01:06:16,572
It's really so dumb.

1112
01:06:16,574 --> 01:06:18,608
It's this dumb horror movie.

1113
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:21,611
- I like horror movies.

1114
01:06:21,613 --> 01:06:24,414
Really, that's my
favorite kind of movie.

1115
01:06:24,416 --> 01:06:26,249
What is this one?

1116
01:06:26,251 --> 01:06:27,384
- It's, it's,

1117
01:06:28,486 --> 01:06:30,720
this one is especially stupid.

1118
01:06:30,722 --> 01:06:32,590
It's, embarrassing.

1119
01:06:36,661 --> 01:06:37,762
- Try me.

1120
01:06:37,764 --> 01:06:39,363
What's it about?

1121
01:06:40,632 --> 01:06:42,366
- It's about stones.

1122
01:06:43,735 --> 01:06:46,270
- What about 'em?

1123
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:48,439
- It's about stones.

1124
01:06:48,441 --> 01:06:50,675
It's, I don't know,
set in Iceland,

1125
01:06:50,677 --> 01:06:52,711
where, I guess, they
have this weird mythology

1126
01:06:52,713 --> 01:06:56,648
where stones turn into
trolls, or something,

1127
01:06:57,717 --> 01:06:59,251
only that's a red
herring, because, really,

1128
01:06:59,253 --> 01:07:02,821
it's this serial killer,
but, for a while,

1129
01:07:03,656 --> 01:07:06,726
you think it is trolls,
and, I don't know.

1130
01:07:06,728 --> 01:07:09,762
It's, I told you,
it's so embarrassing.

1131
01:07:09,764 --> 01:07:10,797
- I like it.

1132
01:07:12,299 --> 01:07:14,434
I think it sounds
good, and I'm sure

1133
01:07:14,436 --> 01:07:16,135
that you're gonna
be great in it,

1134
01:07:16,137 --> 01:07:18,438
and then it'll come
out, and be a big hit,

1135
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:22,142
and I can tell all my
friends I know a movie star.

1136
01:07:22,144 --> 01:07:23,310
Just
whenever you're ready.

1137
01:07:23,312 --> 01:07:25,112
- Oh, thanks.

1138
01:07:26,181 --> 01:07:27,714
Oh, i
forgot to tell you.

1139
01:07:27,716 --> 01:07:28,849
Lucinda's band is playing
this weekend in monterey,

1140
01:07:28,851 --> 01:07:31,185
and a bunch of us
are driving up.

1141
01:07:31,187 --> 01:07:32,686
I don't know if
you're interested.

1142
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:38,593
Don't you ever get tired

1143
01:07:38,595 --> 01:07:41,329
of pretending to be so helpless?

1144
01:07:42,531 --> 01:07:44,399
- Hey! Where you going?

1145
01:07:44,401 --> 01:07:45,834
What are you doing?

1146
01:07:49,205 --> 01:07:50,872
What's the matter with you?

1147
01:07:50,874 --> 01:07:53,209
You're jealous of Violet?

1148
01:07:54,244 --> 01:07:56,112
There's nothing
going on with Violet.

1149
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:57,480
We fucked like a year ago.

1150
01:07:57,482 --> 01:07:59,482
Like a couple times.

1151
01:07:59,484 --> 01:08:02,218
There's five girls in this town.

1152
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:04,854
It's very flattering.

1153
01:08:08,426 --> 01:08:10,494
You gonna get over this?

1154
01:08:10,496 --> 01:08:12,295
She's not looking at us, right?

1155
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:13,797
Is she over there?

1156
01:08:15,767 --> 01:08:16,867
All right.

1157
01:08:18,202 --> 01:08:19,836
It's very flattering.

1158
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:21,905
I have a big day
planned for us, though.

1159
01:08:21,907 --> 01:08:23,140
Okay?

1160
01:08:23,142 --> 01:08:24,175
I got the day off.

1161
01:08:24,177 --> 01:08:26,744
I want to take you to a party.

1162
01:08:27,579 --> 01:08:28,880
It's very sweet.

1163
01:08:28,882 --> 01:08:29,847
You got jealous.

1164
01:09:16,364 --> 01:09:19,833
I don't want
to go back to la.

1165
01:09:19,835 --> 01:09:20,935
- Why not?

1166
01:09:23,238 --> 01:09:24,939
- Just terrible there.

1167
01:09:26,341 --> 01:09:28,310
- So stay here.

1168
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:35,417
- What would I do?

1169
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:38,520
- I don't know.

1170
01:09:38,522 --> 01:09:40,422
Figure it out.

1171
01:09:40,424 --> 01:09:41,456
- I could have a garden.

1172
01:09:41,458 --> 01:09:42,958
- You could.

1173
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:43,960
You like gardening?

1174
01:09:43,962 --> 01:09:44,160
- Mm-hmm.

1175
01:09:46,897 --> 01:09:49,632
I like being outside in the sun.

1176
01:09:51,802 --> 01:09:53,269
In the rain, and.

1177
01:09:55,906 --> 01:09:57,740
- You like fog?

1178
01:09:57,742 --> 01:09:59,408
There's a lot of fog.

1179
01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:01,245
- That sounds nice.

1180
01:10:01,846 --> 01:10:04,348
Being in a garden in the fog.

1181
01:10:07,552 --> 01:10:09,319
'Cause I like to cook.

1182
01:10:09,321 --> 01:10:10,554
- Mmm.

1183
01:10:10,556 --> 01:10:14,825
I like to eat, so, you
see how that worked out?

1184
01:10:14,827 --> 01:10:16,327
- Mm-hmm.

1185
01:10:16,329 --> 01:10:19,397
We're
made for each other.

1186
01:10:38,652 --> 01:10:40,986
Are you
talking about me or the beer?

1187
01:10:40,988 --> 01:10:42,755
- Matt, it's Paul.

1188
01:10:44,658 --> 01:10:45,958
Beth's boyfriend.

1189
01:10:47,495 --> 01:10:49,729
Uh, I'm in big sur, and...

1190
01:10:51,966 --> 01:10:55,468
I can't seem to get
in touch with Beth.

1191
01:11:17,092 --> 01:11:18,726
- Yeah, hi!

1192
01:11:23,032 --> 01:11:24,366
What is this?

1193
01:11:25,935 --> 01:11:26,968
- It's my costume.

1194
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:28,003
- It's beautiful, hi.

1195
01:11:28,005 --> 01:11:30,539
Come on, come on in.

1196
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:31,940
Boy, I thought you
were gonna be a pig.

1197
01:11:31,942 --> 01:11:33,108
I got it
at a thrift store.

1198
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:34,509
I am a pig.

1199
01:11:34,511 --> 01:11:35,111
But you
don't look like a pig.

1200
01:11:35,113 --> 01:11:35,912
- Wait, wait.

1201
01:11:36,646 --> 01:11:37,998
No, you're like
that handsome dude in a tux.

1202
01:11:38,198 --> 01:11:40,083
No, no, no,
I'm a capitalist pig.

1203
01:11:40,085 --> 01:11:40,783
Look. Look.

1204
01:11:42,086 --> 01:11:43,753
All right, you're
a capitalist pig.

1205
01:11:43,755 --> 01:11:46,422
Wait, I gotta, hold, hold on.

1206
01:11:46,424 --> 01:11:48,458
Joplin come
down and see Jesse.

1207
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:49,459
Yeah, he's a pig.

1208
01:11:49,461 --> 01:11:52,396
- Bring it in. My man.

1209
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,501
Mom, can
i get my costume on?

1210
01:11:57,503 --> 01:11:58,869
Yeah, yeah,
if you're quick, though.

1211
01:11:58,871 --> 01:11:59,186
I'm starving.

1212
01:11:59,386 --> 01:12:00,016
- Cool, let's do it.

1213
01:12:00,216 --> 01:12:04,041
Don't give
Jesse a hard time.

1214
01:12:04,977 --> 01:12:06,745
Okay, red is okay?

1215
01:12:07,947 --> 01:12:11,116
So, how long have the two
of you been going out for?

1216
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:13,084
- Oh, we just met yesterday.

1217
01:12:13,086 --> 01:12:15,653
Yeah, has he painted
your picture yet?

1218
01:12:15,655 --> 01:12:16,554
- Oh, god, Jack.

1219
01:12:17,391 --> 01:12:18,156
Don't listen to him.

1220
01:12:18,158 --> 01:12:20,024
He's just jealous because Jesse

1221
01:12:20,026 --> 01:12:22,427
brought such a pretty girl
home, and he's tired of me,

1222
01:12:22,429 --> 01:12:23,929
because I'm old.

1223
01:12:23,931 --> 01:12:24,997
- Yep.

1224
01:12:26,934 --> 01:12:28,667
- Holy crap.

1225
01:12:29,469 --> 01:12:31,704
Holy crap, it's Frankenstein!

1226
01:12:36,042 --> 01:12:37,743
- Save me! Save me!

1227
01:12:38,981 --> 01:12:41,014
Oh my god! Oh no,
I'm gonna faint.

1228
01:12:41,016 --> 01:12:42,015
Uh, I can't breathe.

1229
01:12:42,017 --> 01:12:43,183
I can't, I can't.

1230
01:12:43,185 --> 01:12:44,117
Oh, no, no.

1231
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,720
He's choking me!

1232
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:50,757
Wait, wait, somebody, someone.

1233
01:12:53,094 --> 01:12:56,164
And I'm back from the dead,
and now, I'm gonna kill you!

1234
01:12:56,166 --> 01:12:59,000
And then, I'm gonna
make you set the table.

1235
01:12:59,002 --> 01:13:00,601
To help mommy.

1236
01:13:00,603 --> 01:13:04,772
That's what happens to monsters
who kill their mothers.

1237
01:13:04,774 --> 01:13:05,640
- Joplin.

1238
01:13:07,176 --> 01:13:10,979
Thank you, universe,
for your bounty, beauty,

1239
01:13:10,981 --> 01:13:12,581
and your love.

1240
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:15,751
- That was really good.

1241
01:13:15,753 --> 01:13:16,652
Very nice.

1242
01:13:17,921 --> 01:13:19,822
So tell me, what's her deal?

1243
01:13:19,824 --> 01:13:21,023
- What's her deal?

1244
01:13:21,025 --> 01:13:22,157
- What, is that?

1245
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:23,337
Is that a bad question?

1246
01:13:23,518 --> 01:13:23,904
- A little bit.

1247
01:13:24,104 --> 01:13:26,161
I'm just trying
to get to know the girl.

1248
01:13:26,163 --> 01:13:27,530
- The girl?

1249
01:13:27,532 --> 01:13:28,731
Now, you're really
putting your foot in it.

1250
01:13:28,733 --> 01:13:30,066
She's a woman.
- It's fine.

1251
01:13:30,068 --> 01:13:31,835
- Oh my god, okay.

1252
01:13:31,837 --> 01:13:33,136
The woman, I'm sorry.

1253
01:13:33,138 --> 01:13:35,205
The last time I saw
him, he was like,

1254
01:13:35,207 --> 01:13:38,107
"listen, man, I'm
gonna become a monk,"

1255
01:13:38,109 --> 01:13:41,544
so now, you're here, and
my curiosity is peaked.

1256
01:13:41,546 --> 01:13:43,113
- Summer, lay off.

1257
01:13:44,816 --> 01:13:46,050
Lay off.

1258
01:13:46,052 --> 01:13:48,052
Oh my,
lay off of what?

1259
01:13:48,054 --> 01:13:50,221
I'm just talking to, I'm
trying to get to know her?

1260
01:13:50,223 --> 01:13:51,489
- What information?

1261
01:13:51,491 --> 01:13:53,891
- I don't know, the basics.

1262
01:13:53,893 --> 01:13:57,127
- Just basics.
- - She's an actress.

1263
01:13:57,129 --> 01:13:58,028
- Really?

1264
01:14:00,766 --> 01:14:01,666
- Mm-hmm.

1265
01:14:02,768 --> 01:14:04,870
Summer used
to be an actress.

1266
01:14:04,872 --> 01:14:05,871
- It was another lifetime.

1267
01:14:05,873 --> 01:14:06,905
I was really bad.

1268
01:14:06,907 --> 01:14:07,906
- So.

1269
01:14:07,908 --> 01:14:09,207
Acting is acting.

1270
01:14:09,209 --> 01:14:10,558
She used to Shakespeare
and everything.

1271
01:14:10,683 --> 01:14:11,372
She's really good.

1272
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:14,213
Thank you, and you are next,
if you don't eat your food.

1273
01:14:14,215 --> 01:14:16,649
I'm sorry, that was sweet.

1274
01:14:18,652 --> 01:14:19,785
So, do you like it?

1275
01:14:19,787 --> 01:14:20,686
Acting?

1276
01:14:21,755 --> 01:14:22,922
- Uh, I don't.

1277
01:14:22,924 --> 01:14:24,090
Yeah, I guess.

1278
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:25,825
- Yeah?

1279
01:14:25,827 --> 01:14:27,960
You must be really brave?

1280
01:14:28,762 --> 01:14:31,164
- No, I'm not brave.

1281
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:32,666
- No, I think so.

1282
01:14:37,106 --> 01:14:38,035
- Anybody want more wine?

1283
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:39,872
- Yeah, I'll get it.

1284
01:14:40,072 --> 01:14:41,174
No, no,
no, I'll get it.

1285
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:42,643
I'll get it.

1286
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:43,577
- No, no, it's fine.
- - You sure?

1287
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:45,579
- Out back, on the cooler.

1288
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:04,266
- Do you ever feel like a whore?

1289
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:30,226
- Are you okay?

1290
01:15:30,228 --> 01:15:31,328
- Huh? Yeah.

1291
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:34,265
Let me
see. Let me see.

1292
01:15:34,267 --> 01:15:35,299
What happened?

1293
01:15:40,339 --> 01:15:42,239
Does it really hurt?

1294
01:15:42,241 --> 01:15:43,208
- I don't know.
It's nothing.

1295
01:15:43,242 --> 01:15:45,743
I think there was just
some broken glass.

1296
01:15:45,745 --> 01:15:47,278
- Here.

1297
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,250
- Thanks.
Does it hurt?

1298
01:15:48,281 --> 01:15:50,682
I'm gonna put some
pressure on it.

1299
01:15:50,684 --> 01:15:51,917
No, no,
it's okay, it's okay.

1300
01:15:51,919 --> 01:15:54,119
I feel like
I'm not showing you

1301
01:15:54,121 --> 01:15:55,187
a good time.

1302
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:04,763
I really wasn't expecting
to like you this much.

1303
01:16:08,335 --> 01:16:10,803
You know, when we first
met, when I gave you a lift,

1304
01:16:10,805 --> 01:16:12,238
I thought you were a
snob, but for some reason,

1305
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:15,141
I just kept thinking about you.

1306
01:16:15,143 --> 01:16:17,877
Then you came into the bar, and,

1307
01:16:20,681 --> 01:16:21,682
I was glad.

1308
01:16:24,753 --> 01:16:27,388
And, I think you're
really great.

1309
01:16:29,157 --> 01:16:31,291
I think you're soft, and,

1310
01:16:33,261 --> 01:16:34,161
sweet.

1311
01:16:39,168 --> 01:16:43,271
I feel like you really
understand me, or something.

1312
01:16:43,273 --> 01:16:45,840
I feel like I could want that.

1313
01:16:50,312 --> 01:16:52,491
You're just a really
special person, Beth.

1314
01:18:27,283 --> 01:18:30,152
You pretend to
be so fucking helpless,

1315
01:18:30,154 --> 01:18:32,420
but you're actually
a fucking liar.

1316
01:18:32,422 --> 01:18:34,289
What do
you want from me?

1317
01:18:34,291 --> 01:18:35,957
I bet you think
you're better than me, huh?

1318
01:18:35,959 --> 01:18:37,292
But you're not.

1319
01:18:38,094 --> 01:18:39,758
- Please, please.
You're so obsessed.

1320
01:18:39,958 --> 01:18:42,106
And your are a horrible
fucking creep.

1321
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:43,799
Tell me what
you want from me,

1322
01:18:43,801 --> 01:18:44,801
and I will pay it!

1323
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:46,836
I don't know what you want!

1324
01:18:46,838 --> 01:18:48,171
- That's right, cry.

1325
01:18:48,173 --> 01:18:50,273
Cry, you fucking bitch.

1326
01:18:50,275 --> 01:18:52,508
Fake fucking crocodile tears

1327
01:18:52,510 --> 01:18:55,578
from your fake fucking
Hollywood cunt.

1328
01:18:56,305 --> 01:19:56,395

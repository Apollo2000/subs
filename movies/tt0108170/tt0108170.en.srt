2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,799
Wise men say

3
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:39,603
Only fools rush in

4
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,804
But I can't help

5
00:00:42,844 --> 00:00:47,781
Falling in love with you

6
00:00:47,817 --> 00:00:50,479
Shall I stay

7
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:54,423
Would it be a sin

8
00:00:54,457 --> 00:00:55,617
If I can't help

9
00:00:55,658 --> 00:00:56,819
What are you looking at?

10
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,019
Not much.

11
00:00:58,061 --> 00:00:59,426
Get out,
you stupid bitch!

12
00:00:59,463 --> 00:01:00,725
Don't call me a bitch!

13
00:01:00,764 --> 00:01:02,062
I'm gonna batter you!

14
00:01:02,099 --> 00:01:03,259
Aah!

15
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:05,097
You're dead!

16
00:01:05,136 --> 00:01:07,160
You better not touch me,
Sonny Curley!

17
00:01:07,205 --> 00:01:08,399
I've witnesses!

18
00:01:10,475 --> 00:01:11,738
What did you do to him?

19
00:01:11,776 --> 00:01:13,902
Nothing! I just gave him
a piece of advice!

20
00:01:13,945 --> 00:01:15,880
I dare ya.
I bleedin' dare ya.

21
00:01:15,914 --> 00:01:17,211
I told him to stop
fiddlin' with himself...

22
00:01:17,248 --> 00:01:18,614
when he thought there
was no one looking!

23
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:20,015
I'll batter you!

24
00:01:20,052 --> 00:01:21,212
Sorry. You'll have
to make an appointment.

25
00:01:21,253 --> 00:01:22,481
You're dead!

26
00:01:22,521 --> 00:01:23,716
Is that a fact?
Very interesting.

27
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:27,790
Shut up!

28
00:01:27,826 --> 00:01:29,317
You're dead.

29
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:30,522
I'm telling Ma!

30
00:01:30,564 --> 00:01:32,225
If you tell Ma...

31
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:35,531
Where you going?

32
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:37,003
Piss off! Don't!

33
00:01:45,912 --> 00:01:47,174
You're what?

34
00:01:47,214 --> 00:01:48,705
You heard me.

35
00:01:48,748 --> 00:01:50,409
Oh, my Jesus.

36
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,214
You're pregnant, you said?

37
00:01:52,253 --> 00:01:53,413
Yeah.

38
00:01:53,453 --> 00:01:54,854
That's lovely, that is.

39
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:56,049
You sure?

40
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,922
Yeah. Sort of.

41
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,087
- What?
- Yeah.

42
00:02:00,128 --> 00:02:01,925
Positive now?
You're only nineteen.

43
00:02:01,963 --> 00:02:03,364
- I'm twenty.
- You're only twenty.

44
00:02:03,398 --> 00:02:04,558
I know what age I am.

45
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,569
Don't start getting
snotty with me.

46
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:07,933
I should be getting
snotty with you.

47
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:09,666
Sorry.

48
00:02:09,706 --> 00:02:12,037
It's shocking, that is.

49
00:02:12,075 --> 00:02:13,303
What do you think?

50
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:15,676
- I don't know.
- That the best you can do?

51
00:02:15,713 --> 00:02:17,373
Well, what do you think?

52
00:02:17,413 --> 00:02:18,574
I don't know.

53
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:20,481
I should give out, I suppose...

54
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,417
or throw a wobbler
or something...

55
00:02:22,453 --> 00:02:24,649
but what's the point?

56
00:02:24,688 --> 00:02:28,351
I mean, if she was...

57
00:02:28,393 --> 00:02:31,226
You should have
come to us earlier.

58
00:02:31,263 --> 00:02:33,594
Before, you know, when...

59
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:35,759
said you were
gonna get pregnant...

60
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,667
then we could've done
something about it.

61
00:02:38,703 --> 00:02:40,001
My God.

62
00:02:43,442 --> 00:02:47,038
You're positive, now?
Absolutely certain? Shh.

63
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:50,072
Molly, my Irish Molly

64
00:02:50,117 --> 00:02:52,279
Good girl.
What's that on your face?

65
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,718
Shaving foam.

66
00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:56,747
Oh. Well, fair enough.

67
00:02:58,927 --> 00:03:02,727
My Irish Molly,
when you are near

68
00:03:10,072 --> 00:03:11,233
Who was it?

69
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:13,641
What? I don't know.

70
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:15,235
Ah, now, Jesus...

71
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,473
- No, I do know.
- Well?

72
00:03:16,513 --> 00:03:18,845
I'm not telling.

73
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:20,145
Now, look...

74
00:03:21,685 --> 00:03:24,382
Jesus, do you hear that?

75
00:03:24,422 --> 00:03:26,219
Gobshite!

76
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:37,294
Now, don't start that.
Just tell us.

77
00:03:37,336 --> 00:03:38,964
- I can't.
- Why not?

78
00:03:39,005 --> 00:03:40,802
- I just can't, right?
- Well, is he married?

79
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,307
No, he's not.

80
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:44,538
Well, that's something
I suppose.

81
00:03:44,577 --> 00:03:46,101
Ah, Kay... Jesus,
stop it, will you?

82
00:03:47,847 --> 00:03:50,544
The music getting to you,
is it?

83
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,348
They're inside
watching the telly.

84
00:03:53,387 --> 00:03:55,014
Go on, get in there.

85
00:03:55,055 --> 00:03:56,887
Go. Get in.

86
00:03:56,924 --> 00:04:00,018
Go on.

87
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:01,823
Will he marry you?

88
00:04:01,862 --> 00:04:03,626
No, I don't think so.

89
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:06,326
Ooh, the louser.
That's cheatin', that is.

90
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:08,859
- It's not a game.
- I know that, Kay.

91
00:04:08,903 --> 00:04:11,371
I mean, it's his fault
as much as Sharon's...

92
00:04:11,406 --> 00:04:12,998
isn't it, whoever he is.

93
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,406
I mean, it was his flute that...

94
00:04:14,443 --> 00:04:16,171
You've the filthiest mouth!

95
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:17,404
Ah, lay off, Kay, will you?

96
00:04:17,446 --> 00:04:18,708
I'm being harassed!

97
00:04:18,747 --> 00:04:20,682
You just move!

98
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:22,182
Look, do you want to keep it?

99
00:04:23,854 --> 00:04:25,218
What do you mean?

100
00:04:25,254 --> 00:04:26,481
Do you want to...

101
00:04:26,521 --> 00:04:28,251
He wants to know
do you want an abortion?

102
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,917
I do not!

103
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,951
There's no way
I'm having an abortion!

104
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:33,690
Good, you're right!

105
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,097
You definitely won't
tell us who it is?

106
00:04:37,134 --> 00:04:39,729
No! Sorry.

107
00:04:41,838 --> 00:04:44,968
Well, there's no more
to be said, is there?

108
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,568
She's obviously
made her mind up.

109
00:04:48,614 --> 00:04:51,242
A man needs a pint
after all that.

110
00:04:51,283 --> 00:04:53,308
Hang on a second.

111
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:54,650
Yes, love?

112
00:04:54,686 --> 00:04:56,381
Is that all?

113
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:58,083
What do you mean?

114
00:04:58,123 --> 00:05:01,218
It's a terrible...

115
00:05:01,261 --> 00:05:02,955
the neighbors!

116
00:05:02,995 --> 00:05:06,488
Do you care what
the neighbors think?

117
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:07,727
Yes, I do.

118
00:05:07,768 --> 00:05:09,759
Sure, the O'Neill young ones
are after having kids.

119
00:05:09,804 --> 00:05:11,100
The pair of them.

120
00:05:11,138 --> 00:05:12,331
And the Bells
would be the same...

121
00:05:12,372 --> 00:05:13,533
except they don't
have any daughters...

122
00:05:13,574 --> 00:05:14,733
but you know what I mean.

123
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:16,800
Tara O'Neill had her baby
for Paddy Bell.

124
00:05:16,844 --> 00:05:18,676
Of course she did.

125
00:05:18,712 --> 00:05:20,907
So fuck the neighbors.

126
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:24,846
You coming for a drink, Sharon?

127
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:27,411
- No, thanks, Da.
- Come on.

128
00:05:29,558 --> 00:05:31,026
All right.

129
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,288
Good girl.

130
00:05:32,328 --> 00:05:34,193
How about you, Kay?

131
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,825
Ah, no.
I'll slip on up to bed.

132
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:38,197
I'd come up with ya...

133
00:05:38,234 --> 00:05:40,066
only I've an awful throat
on me.

134
00:05:40,102 --> 00:05:43,197
Cheerio now... Grannie.

135
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,266
Ohh, Molly

136
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,676
My Irish Molly

137
00:05:48,711 --> 00:05:53,412
My sweet acushla dear

138
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:56,648
I'm fairly off my trolley

139
00:05:56,688 --> 00:06:01,592
My Irish Molly,
when you are near

140
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,627
Still think you should
tell us who the da is.

141
00:06:03,662 --> 00:06:05,630
You can think away, then.

142
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,594
Your mummy took it very well.

143
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:12,833
Yeah. She was great.

144
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:16,036
She's a bit old-fashioned,
you know.

145
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,442
Set in her ways.

146
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,944
Yeah.

147
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,345
No, she was great.

148
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,745
So were you.

149
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:23,044
Ahh.

150
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,319
Those your pals over there?

151
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,448
Yeah.

152
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,357
Go on over to them.
I'll be all right on me own.

153
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:34,861
Ah, no.

154
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:37,126
Go on. You might as well.
I'll be grand.

155
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,860
I can always
slip downstairs.

156
00:06:51,446 --> 00:06:52,936
I was so embarrassed,
I was scarlet.

157
00:06:52,981 --> 00:06:54,540
I'm not joking yous,
I was burnin'!

158
00:06:54,584 --> 00:06:55,743
How are yous?

159
00:06:55,784 --> 00:06:57,878
- Go on.
- How are you, Sharon?

160
00:06:57,921 --> 00:07:00,288
He was holding the eclair
in his hand like this.

161
00:07:00,323 --> 00:07:01,950
The place was full,
and he says...

162
00:07:01,991 --> 00:07:04,460
"Why did you rob the cream
out of me eclair?"

163
00:07:04,494 --> 00:07:06,725
- The head on him, Jesus!
- And did you rob it?

164
00:07:06,764 --> 00:07:08,391
Well, I paid for
the bleedin' thing.

165
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:10,662
Why shouldn't I have?
I told him to cop on.

166
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:13,932
"I seen ya," he says,
"with your finger."

167
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:15,439
So I gave him the finger.

168
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:19,210
I'd shag the elephant man before
I'd let him near me again.

169
00:07:19,244 --> 00:07:20,403
The prick.

170
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:22,436
Here, young fella!

171
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:25,314
Give us three vodkas, two cokes,
and a glass of Furstenberg.

172
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,648
Have you got that now, chicken?

173
00:07:26,685 --> 00:07:29,587
Hey, handsome, give us a packet
of crisps as well, will ya?

174
00:07:29,621 --> 00:07:31,113
And do you have any nuts?

175
00:07:31,157 --> 00:07:33,183
Whoo! You dirty bitch!

176
00:07:33,226 --> 00:07:34,989
I'm only messing with you.

177
00:07:35,027 --> 00:07:36,860
He's a nice
little bum on him...

178
00:07:36,898 --> 00:07:38,490
like two eggs in a hankie.

179
00:07:40,135 --> 00:07:41,795
He'll be nice-looking
when he's older, won't he?

180
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,361
Are you going to break it off
with him anyway?

181
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:44,564
Yeah.

182
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:47,474
I was giving the matter
my serious consideration.

183
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,170
Then when I saw him
sulking, Jesus!

184
00:07:49,211 --> 00:07:51,805
He was very good-looking,
though. Very handsome.

185
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:53,007
Not really, Mary.

186
00:07:53,048 --> 00:07:54,880
Not when you got
up close to him.

187
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:56,248
Beauty's only skin deep.

188
00:07:56,286 --> 00:07:57,618
It wasn't even that deep, Mary.

189
00:07:57,654 --> 00:07:59,815
He'd loads of little spots
on his chin.

190
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,756
Tiny, little ones, now.

191
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:03,053
Millions of them!

192
00:08:03,093 --> 00:08:04,652
Only noticed 'em when you
were right up against them...

193
00:08:04,695 --> 00:08:06,025
then you want to throw up.

194
00:08:06,063 --> 00:08:07,394
He was thick as well.

195
00:08:07,431 --> 00:08:10,401
Come here, Jackie.
Was he passionate?

196
00:08:10,434 --> 00:08:12,767
No! But he thought he was.
You know what I mean?

197
00:08:12,804 --> 00:08:14,669
He was just a big, thick monkey.

198
00:08:14,705 --> 00:08:18,072
Looking for somewhere
to stick his banana, what?

199
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,237
Ha! Yvonne Burgess!

200
00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:24,143
He stuck his tongue
in me ear once...

201
00:08:24,182 --> 00:08:25,513
and I'm not joking yous.

202
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:27,313
He was trying to get it
out the other one.

203
00:08:27,353 --> 00:08:29,048
Don't know what he
thought I had in there.

204
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:31,421
His sense of direction
wasn't the best, either.

205
00:08:31,457 --> 00:08:33,550
- Know what I mean?
- Jackie O'Keefe!

206
00:08:33,593 --> 00:08:35,960
You're bleedin' disgusting,
you are!

207
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:37,554
Any news, Sharon?

208
00:08:37,598 --> 00:08:40,397
No. Not really.

209
00:08:50,044 --> 00:08:52,410
"Then the discharge...

210
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:56,008
"becomes yellow and offensive.

211
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:58,953
"Any infected discharge...

212
00:08:58,987 --> 00:09:01,820
"may also result
in soreness...

213
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:05,452
"or actual irritation...

214
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:08,429
"at the entrance
of the vagina."

215
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,398
Jesus, me fanny!

216
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:18,704
"It's only
the unfortunate few...

217
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:20,642
"who suffer severe nausea...

218
00:09:20,678 --> 00:09:22,542
"or recurrent vomiting."

219
00:09:26,951 --> 00:09:29,852
Sharon, it's not fair!
You've been in there ages!

220
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:31,947
Get out of there.
You leave Sharon alone.

221
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,082
You all right in there,
Sharon?

222
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:37,658
Yeah. Coming.

223
00:09:37,695 --> 00:09:40,824
Ah, no, no. There's no hurry.
No, I've been in already.

224
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:42,026
Ohh...

225
00:09:42,068 --> 00:09:44,298
Jesus, what were you
drinking last night?

226
00:09:44,337 --> 00:09:45,667
I'm going back to bed.

227
00:09:45,705 --> 00:09:47,639
Ah, yeah, go on. Good girl.

228
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:48,868
I'll go on without you, what?

229
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:51,069
- What's up with her?
- You shut your mouth.

230
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:52,339
Get in there
and get your clothes on.

231
00:09:52,377 --> 00:09:53,676
Go down to get
your breakfast...

232
00:09:53,713 --> 00:09:55,806
and get a bleedin' job
for yourself, right?

233
00:10:07,394 --> 00:10:09,862
Sharon, we're going
to have to tell them.

234
00:10:15,804 --> 00:10:19,400
Stop it, will yous?
Keep it... here, give me that.

235
00:10:21,111 --> 00:10:23,805
Hey! Shh!

236
00:10:23,847 --> 00:10:26,371
Now... stop it.

237
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:29,942
Are yous all listening?

238
00:10:29,988 --> 00:10:31,716
I'm in hurry.
Will you get on with it?

239
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:32,915
Shut up!

240
00:10:32,955 --> 00:10:34,719
He has to sit on the wall
all day and do nothin'.

241
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:37,694
You go and shite you,
you stupid bitch... what?

242
00:10:37,728 --> 00:10:39,196
Don't you "what" me,
Sonny Curley.

243
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,390
No language like that
in this house.

244
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,829
- Exactly!
- Don't start, you.

245
00:10:41,866 --> 00:10:43,835
- You never hit her!
- I do so!

246
00:10:43,868 --> 00:10:45,496
I'm not taking this!

247
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:47,198
Have a nice day!

248
00:10:47,238 --> 00:10:48,536
You better watch yourself...

249
00:10:48,574 --> 00:10:49,871
or you'll find yourself...

250
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:52,070
packing your shampoo
and spot creams.

251
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:54,478
I'm sorry, you'll have to
discuss it with my solicitor.

252
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:57,642
Don't you start.

253
00:10:57,684 --> 00:11:00,117
Now...

254
00:11:00,153 --> 00:11:02,678
Sharon has
a bit of news for yous.

255
00:11:02,722 --> 00:11:04,849
I can't help it.

256
00:11:04,891 --> 00:11:07,018
I'm sorry, Sharon.
Go on, love.

257
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,157
I'm going to have a baby.

258
00:11:11,198 --> 00:11:13,359
- That's massive, Sharon.
- Is that all?

259
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,264
Women, what?

260
00:11:15,302 --> 00:11:16,599
Right.

261
00:11:16,637 --> 00:11:19,197
Where's your bump?

262
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:22,940
They'll drive Sharon spare.

263
00:11:24,612 --> 00:11:27,012
That's a weed there. Look.

264
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:30,177
She belched there,
inside with the telly.

265
00:11:30,219 --> 00:11:33,016
Kimberley asked her
if she was gonna have the baby.

266
00:11:33,055 --> 00:11:34,920
I don't know.

267
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:37,991
It's hard to believe
you can get so much shite...

268
00:11:38,027 --> 00:11:40,085
out of only one dog, isn't it?

269
00:11:40,128 --> 00:11:42,062
- Dessie?
- Huh?

270
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:43,725
Do you not think
we should tell the girls...

271
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:44,926
what Sharon did was wrong?

272
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:46,128
What?

273
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:49,537
I don't mean turn them
against her or anything...

274
00:11:49,573 --> 00:11:51,301
Or the baby, remember.

275
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:54,505
- Yes, I know that. But...
- What?

276
00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:56,445
I think we should tell them.

277
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:58,072
Without, you know...

278
00:11:58,116 --> 00:12:00,015
I think we should tell them...

279
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:03,077
that it's better to be married
if you're pregnant.

280
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:06,114
Jeez, they're a bit young,
aren't they?

281
00:12:06,157 --> 00:12:07,921
I mean, Lisa, maybe.

282
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:12,159
You'll need a shears for that.

283
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,264
What were you thinking
of telling them?

284
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,134
Do you think we should?

285
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:20,538
Whatever you think
yourself, Kay.

286
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:22,804
I'm only their da.
They'll laugh at me.

287
00:12:22,844 --> 00:12:24,835
Times have changed.

288
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:27,144
Jesus, where did
she leave her cop-on?

289
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:29,650
Did she never
hear of contraception?

290
00:12:34,556 --> 00:12:36,457
Do you remember that
crombie coat you used to have?

291
00:12:36,492 --> 00:12:37,652
What?

292
00:12:37,694 --> 00:12:39,184
Do you remember the coat?

293
00:12:39,228 --> 00:12:41,754
- No.
- You do so!

294
00:12:41,798 --> 00:12:44,824
You used to keep it spotless
except for your dandruff.

295
00:12:44,869 --> 00:12:47,531
- I didn't have dandruff.
- You did so!

296
00:12:47,571 --> 00:12:49,470
After you bought it,
you stopped trying...

297
00:12:49,506 --> 00:12:51,236
to get me to go into
the fields with you.

298
00:12:51,274 --> 00:12:52,468
It was
the best contraceptive...

299
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,842
ever invented, that coat.

300
00:12:57,615 --> 00:12:59,709
It's in the attic.

301
00:13:01,286 --> 00:13:03,278
How are ya?

302
00:13:05,892 --> 00:13:07,791
How are ya, Sharon?

303
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,724
I'm pregnant.
Did I tell yous?

304
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:15,860
Ha ha ha!

305
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:21,834
Yeah, well, I am.

306
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:25,675
She's bleedin' serious!

307
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,881
- Well done, Sharon.
- Thanks, Jackie.

308
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:36,547
Yeah, Sharon. Congrats.

309
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:37,750
Thanks, Mary.

310
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,818
Well done, Sharon,
ya thick bitch, ya.

311
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,667
Jesus, though, Sharon.

312
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,565
I know.
It's terrible, really.

313
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:50,093
- How long you gone, Sharon?
- Sixteen weeks.

314
00:13:50,138 --> 00:13:51,435
You don't look it.

315
00:13:51,474 --> 00:13:52,634
I do.

316
00:13:52,675 --> 00:13:55,007
I won't argue.
You're the expert.

317
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:56,204
I'm only messin'.

318
00:13:56,245 --> 00:13:57,838
I'll start getting bigger
in a few weeks.

319
00:13:57,881 --> 00:14:00,371
You can hang around
with someone else then.

320
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,783
No fellas'll come near us
if one of us is pregnant.

321
00:14:02,818 --> 00:14:06,152
So, Sharon,
who you havin' it for?

322
00:14:11,996 --> 00:14:13,657
I can't tell. Sorry.

323
00:14:13,698 --> 00:14:15,393
Sharon. Give us a hint.

324
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:16,593
- No.
- Just a little one.

325
00:14:16,635 --> 00:14:17,794
Do we know him?

326
00:14:17,835 --> 00:14:20,303
You're scarlet.
We must know him.

327
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:21,930
Is he married?

328
00:14:21,973 --> 00:14:23,134
- Jesus!
- No, he's not.

329
00:14:23,175 --> 00:14:24,937
I'll bet you he is.

330
00:14:24,977 --> 00:14:26,945
- Is he in here?
- Jesus, Yvonne!

331
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:28,777
Would you do it
with anyone here?

332
00:14:28,814 --> 00:14:30,441
I was only asking!

333
00:14:30,483 --> 00:14:33,975
You're right, though.
Sorry for insulting you, Sharon.

334
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,511
Seriously, though, Sharon.
Do we really not know him?

335
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:38,286
No. Swear to God.

336
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:40,258
Where did yous...

337
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:42,887
Look, I don't want
to talk about it, all right?

338
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:44,761
Let's get pissed, will we?

339
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,426
Oh, yeah.

340
00:14:50,238 --> 00:14:53,674
Young Sharon's after
getting herself up the pole.

341
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,039
Your Sharon, like?

342
00:14:55,076 --> 00:14:56,942
Yeah. Gas, isn't it?

343
00:14:56,978 --> 00:14:59,105
But she's not married.

344
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,375
I know that.

345
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:01,575
Who did the damage?

346
00:15:01,616 --> 00:15:03,585
We don't know.
She won't tell us.

347
00:15:03,618 --> 00:15:05,314
You'd want to find out,
wouldn't you?

348
00:15:05,355 --> 00:15:07,219
Excuse me, compadre.

349
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:09,315
What's it to you who it was?

350
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,693
I couldn't give a shite
who it was.

351
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:15,357
I'm not gonna buy the food,
the nappies...

352
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,766
or the little bleedin'
track suits.

353
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:18,961
Dessie is!

354
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:20,436
I am in me hole!

355
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:24,032
Hang on a sec.

356
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:26,407
Maybe I will, what?

357
00:15:26,444 --> 00:15:28,912
Ah, so what? I don't care.

358
00:15:28,947 --> 00:15:31,211
It's only a baby.
Snapper, what?

359
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,650
Compadre...

360
00:15:33,685 --> 00:15:38,487
I can let you have
some very good baby clothes.

361
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:41,585
Mucho goodo stuff. Benetton.

362
00:15:41,628 --> 00:15:45,086
- Ha ha! Benetton.
- Very competitive price.

363
00:15:45,132 --> 00:15:46,996
Sorry, lads.

364
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:49,000
Will you take a few
of these raffle tickets off me?

365
00:15:49,034 --> 00:15:50,899
What for?

366
00:15:50,937 --> 00:15:52,699
This.

367
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,306
We need a new set of jerseys
for the under-fifteen lads.

368
00:15:58,345 --> 00:16:02,679
They've all grown bigger
since the start of the season.

369
00:16:02,716 --> 00:16:06,847
Here, we'll take a few
for Sharon's snapper, will we?

370
00:16:06,888 --> 00:16:08,549
That's a very good idea.

371
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:10,490
No!

372
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:12,993
Here you go, Georgie. Here.

373
00:16:13,028 --> 00:16:14,928
There.

374
00:16:17,132 --> 00:16:19,032
Thanks very much, lads.

375
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:20,762
That's great.

376
00:16:22,705 --> 00:16:25,697
Oh, give a little. Helps a lot.

377
00:16:25,742 --> 00:16:28,040
- Gobshite.
- Absolutely.

378
00:16:28,077 --> 00:16:30,011
Listen...

379
00:16:30,046 --> 00:16:31,537
Do you think
she'll get married?

380
00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:32,776
What's that?

381
00:16:32,815 --> 00:16:34,807
Oh, no. No.
Jesus, no.

382
00:16:34,852 --> 00:16:36,911
They've more cop-on
these days, eh?

383
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,421
I mean,
would you get married...

384
00:16:38,454 --> 00:16:40,355
if you were that age
again... these days?

385
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:44,259
- What?
- I think I'm going to cry.

386
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:47,129
Anyway, I wouldn't want Sharon
getting married that young.

387
00:16:47,165 --> 00:16:49,191
She's her whole life
ahead of her.

388
00:16:49,234 --> 00:16:50,462
Exactly.

389
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:52,402
Unless she drinks an iffy pint.

390
00:16:54,874 --> 00:16:57,671
Having a baby's the most
natural thing in the world.

391
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:00,474
- That's right!
- Oh, good shite!

392
00:17:00,514 --> 00:17:04,144
Olי, olי, olי, olי

393
00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:07,882
Olי, olי

394
00:17:07,922 --> 00:17:09,082
Whoo!

395
00:17:09,123 --> 00:17:10,921
Was it Dessie Delaney?

396
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,224
- No!
- I was only askin'!

397
00:17:13,262 --> 00:17:16,232
Well, don't!
I'm not tellin', so feck off!

398
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:21,427
Was it Billy Delaney, then?

399
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,798
Sharon Curley's
pregnant, did you hear?

400
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:58,002
Sharon Curley's up the pole.

401
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:00,445
Sharon Curley's having a baby.

402
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,142
I don't believe you!

403
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:04,342
Jesus!

404
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:07,478
Jesus! Are you serious?

405
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:09,113
Who's she having it for?

406
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:10,747
I don't know.

407
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,587
She won't say.

408
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:16,687
She doesn't know. Ha ha ha!

409
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:19,529
She can't remember!

410
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:20,761
That's shocking!

411
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:22,496
Dirty bitch.

412
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:25,164
Mmm. Poor Sharon.

413
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:26,538
The slut!

414
00:18:26,574 --> 00:18:28,405
I don't believe her.

415
00:18:28,443 --> 00:18:30,502
The stupid bitch.

416
00:18:30,545 --> 00:18:32,377
She had that coming.

417
00:18:32,415 --> 00:18:34,007
Serves her right.

418
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,518
Ah, poor Sharon.

419
00:18:36,552 --> 00:18:39,852
Let's see her get
into those jeans now.

420
00:18:44,594 --> 00:18:47,119
Are you all right, Sharon?

421
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:51,724
Are you all right, Sharon?

422
00:19:13,492 --> 00:19:15,084
- Now?
- Yeah.

423
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:18,861
Aw, God almighty.

424
00:19:29,677 --> 00:19:31,076
Jesus, Sharon.

425
00:19:31,113 --> 00:19:33,604
You'll soon be
the same shape as me, what?

426
00:19:33,648 --> 00:19:35,808
Thanks very much.

427
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:39,480
Now I've got to know
what is and isn't mine

428
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,921
He's coming! He's coming!

429
00:19:41,957 --> 00:19:44,358
If you received my letter

430
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:46,794
We should have met him
at the airport.

431
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:48,262
Not at all.

432
00:19:48,296 --> 00:19:51,129
Then you'll know
just what to do

433
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,635
If you still want me

434
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,830
If

435
00:19:54,872 --> 00:19:57,966
You still want me

436
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:02,208
Well, tie a yellow ribbon

437
00:20:02,246 --> 00:20:05,045
'Round the old oak tree

438
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,813
It's been three long years

439
00:20:07,852 --> 00:20:10,480
Do you still want me?

440
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:11,784
Still want me

441
00:20:11,823 --> 00:20:13,586
If I don't see a ribbon

442
00:20:13,626 --> 00:20:16,823
'Round the old oak tree

443
00:20:16,862 --> 00:20:18,590
I'll stay on the bus

444
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,031
Forget about us

445
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:22,933
Put the blame on me

446
00:20:22,968 --> 00:20:25,163
Craig, love.

447
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:31,575
Sharon's having a baby.

448
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,043
Is that right?

449
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:34,546
That's right, yeah.

450
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:37,276
Who was it? Do you want me
to sort him out for you?

451
00:20:37,316 --> 00:20:39,216
Sure, I already offered...

452
00:20:39,252 --> 00:20:40,513
Grow up, will you?

453
00:20:42,088 --> 00:20:43,919
No bullets?

454
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,117
No.

455
00:20:45,158 --> 00:20:46,786
Well, what's the point
of giving you a gun...

456
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,818
if they don't give
you Jesus bullets?

457
00:20:48,863 --> 00:20:50,387
So we wouldn't shoot anyone.

458
00:20:50,431 --> 00:20:52,364
I thought that was the point.

459
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,925
How else you supposed
to keep the bleedin' peace?

460
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:56,198
That's crazy, that is.

461
00:20:56,237 --> 00:20:58,068
It was no joke, all right?

462
00:20:58,105 --> 00:20:59,403
You had to look
straight at 'em.

463
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:01,601
- Who?
- The Arabs.

464
00:21:01,643 --> 00:21:03,338
Straight at them.

465
00:21:03,378 --> 00:21:07,474
Straight into their eyes.
Mesmerize them.

466
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,507
Easier said than done,
I'd say.

467
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:12,680
Who are you telling?

468
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,552
Thanks.

469
00:21:23,902 --> 00:21:26,131
Hit me, will you?

470
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,297
Get out!

471
00:21:32,276 --> 00:21:33,608
Hey, Sharon.

472
00:21:33,645 --> 00:21:36,842
You forgot your piss. Urine.

473
00:21:36,882 --> 00:21:38,076
Da!

474
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:14,452
Next time you try that,
you better watch it.

475
00:22:14,491 --> 00:22:16,357
For God's sake, are you daft?

476
00:22:16,393 --> 00:22:18,122
He's not only daft.

477
00:22:18,161 --> 00:22:20,391
He's such a roving eye for
everybody in this hospital.

478
00:22:20,431 --> 00:22:23,161
Did you see him?
Every young student doctor...

479
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,997
She wanted to know
my menstrual history.

480
00:22:25,037 --> 00:22:27,334
I didn't know what she was
talking about till she told me.

481
00:22:27,371 --> 00:22:28,861
I felt like
a right bleedin'eejit.

482
00:22:28,906 --> 00:22:30,738
Why didn't she
just say "your periods"?

483
00:22:30,776 --> 00:22:31,936
We'll weigh you now, Sharon.

484
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:34,070
Doctors are always like that.

485
00:22:34,113 --> 00:22:35,875
"Menstrual history."

486
00:22:35,914 --> 00:22:37,779
I got a "C" in that
in me inter.

487
00:22:41,154 --> 00:22:42,849
How are your movements?

488
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:45,322
Not bad. How's yours?

489
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,392
There's the heartbeat now.
See it?

490
00:22:57,437 --> 00:22:58,837
Yeah.

491
00:22:58,872 --> 00:23:00,805
Only one heart.

492
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,035
What?

493
00:23:02,075 --> 00:23:04,136
There aren't twins in there.

494
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:06,646
Oh, yeah.

495
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,911
That there is a leg.
See it?

496
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,144
Oh, yeah.

497
00:23:18,928 --> 00:23:20,259
Sharon?

498
00:23:20,296 --> 00:23:22,229
Why didn't you
come in this morning?

499
00:23:22,263 --> 00:23:24,129
Had a checkup.
I swapped with Mona.

500
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:25,326
You should be on check...

501
00:23:25,368 --> 00:23:26,528
Ask her.

502
00:23:26,569 --> 00:23:27,729
You should be on check-out now.

503
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,067
I can't do it!

504
00:23:29,106 --> 00:23:30,333
Why not?

505
00:23:30,374 --> 00:23:32,842
'Cause I have to keep
going to the toilet!

506
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:35,106
Why aren't you in uniform?

507
00:23:35,146 --> 00:23:39,412
It doesn't fit me anymore!

508
00:23:39,449 --> 00:23:41,577
He must be
a right fucking bastard!

509
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:42,881
I know what I'd have told him.

510
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:44,513
He blushed.
You should've seen him.

511
00:23:44,555 --> 00:23:46,045
Just 'cause I said "toilet."

512
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:47,717
Is he good-looking, Sharon?

513
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,249
Ah, you're joking me.

514
00:23:49,293 --> 00:23:50,852
You know Roland the rat?

515
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:53,388
Well, he looks like him,
only not as nice.

516
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,659
He asked me why I wasn't
wearing me uniform...

517
00:23:56,703 --> 00:23:57,862
so I stuck out me belly...

518
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,667
and I said,
"It doesn't fit me anymore!"

519
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:01,071
You were dead right, Sharon.

520
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,472
You should've stuck
one of your tits...

521
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:03,941
in his mouth as well.

522
00:24:05,312 --> 00:24:07,336
You should see
the state of me nipples.

523
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,609
Jesus.

524
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:10,206
Frank Kinsella's a ride,
isn't he?

525
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,219
- It wasn't him.
- I didn't say he...

526
00:24:12,253 --> 00:24:14,016
It wasn't him.
It wasn't his brother.

527
00:24:14,054 --> 00:24:16,023
It wasn't my brother.
It wasn't Bart Simpson.

528
00:24:16,057 --> 00:24:17,285
It wasn't anybody.

529
00:24:17,324 --> 00:24:18,882
Now get off me bleedin' back,
will ya? I'm sick of it!

530
00:24:18,926 --> 00:24:21,293
- She didn't...
- You keep out of it, right!

531
00:24:21,328 --> 00:24:23,092
He is a ride, though, isn't he?

532
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,291
Frank Kinsella.

533
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:27,328
Bitch.

534
00:24:33,076 --> 00:24:34,703
What's that that's on, Sharon?

535
00:24:34,744 --> 00:24:37,406
- Yachting.
- Ah, good shite.

536
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,212
Would you look at
that fucking eejit?

537
00:24:47,224 --> 00:24:49,455
Can you not just say eejit?

538
00:24:49,493 --> 00:24:53,122
That's what I did say.
Where are you going?

539
00:24:53,164 --> 00:24:55,394
- Toilet.
- Jesus, again?

540
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:57,163
Me uterus is pressing
into me bladder.

541
00:24:57,202 --> 00:24:58,464
Ah, now stop that, Sharon!

542
00:24:58,503 --> 00:24:59,868
I don't want to hear
that sort of thing!

543
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,065
It's not right.

544
00:25:01,107 --> 00:25:02,266
Sorry.

545
00:25:02,308 --> 00:25:03,502
It's OK.

546
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,069
Where's the remote?

547
00:25:06,112 --> 00:25:07,409
Da?

548
00:25:07,447 --> 00:25:09,539
No, you can't have a bike.

549
00:25:13,185 --> 00:25:15,551
It's not his birthday
for ages yet, is it?

550
00:25:21,327 --> 00:25:23,659
Oh, Jesus.

551
00:25:25,532 --> 00:25:28,433
There's nothing
on the telly tonight, is there?

552
00:25:28,469 --> 00:25:30,595
There's never anything on.

553
00:25:30,637 --> 00:25:32,037
Oh, you're right, of course...

554
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:36,032
but there's absolutely
nothing on tonight, is there?

555
00:25:47,156 --> 00:25:49,021
I suppose a ride
is out of the question?

556
00:25:52,228 --> 00:25:54,161
Hang on till
I get this line done.

557
00:25:54,197 --> 00:25:55,664
You serious?

558
00:25:55,698 --> 00:25:57,995
I suppose so.

559
00:25:58,034 --> 00:26:00,525
Fucking great.

560
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:01,868
You're not messing now?

561
00:26:01,906 --> 00:26:03,271
No.

562
00:26:03,306 --> 00:26:05,241
Just let me finish
the next line.

563
00:26:06,977 --> 00:26:08,968
I'll go up
and brush me teeth.

564
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:12,981
That'll be nice.

565
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:16,217
Come on,
up on the stools, everybody.

566
00:26:16,253 --> 00:26:17,812
I've an announcement to make.
Quick.

567
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:19,153
Come on, move it,
move it, will yous?

568
00:26:19,191 --> 00:26:21,023
Come on!
Quick, get up there!

569
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,961
Would you take it easy?

570
00:26:22,996 --> 00:26:24,361
Get her down off that.

571
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:26,025
People have to eat at the...

572
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:27,693
Get her off the stool!

573
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,731
Shut up! Shut up!

574
00:26:31,772 --> 00:26:33,070
Happy birthday, Darren.

575
00:26:33,106 --> 00:26:34,403
Happy birthday, Darren.

576
00:26:34,441 --> 00:26:36,569
Yeah, good lad.
There you go, what.

577
00:26:36,611 --> 00:26:38,306
- What is it?
- Open it and see.

578
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,507
It's not a bike.

579
00:26:39,547 --> 00:26:41,482
He's brilliant, isn't he?

580
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:42,710
I know that!

581
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:44,878
- Ooh, wow.
- Very nice.

582
00:26:46,455 --> 00:26:47,615
It's a pump.

583
00:26:47,656 --> 00:26:49,180
It's a very good one, too.

584
00:26:49,225 --> 00:26:50,853
See, I'm gonna get you a wheel
for your Christmas...

585
00:26:50,894 --> 00:26:52,259
and another wheel
for your next birthday...

586
00:26:52,294 --> 00:26:53,956
and then the saddle, what.
Ha ha ha ha.

587
00:26:53,997 --> 00:26:56,192
You can pump yourself
to school every morning now.

588
00:26:56,234 --> 00:26:57,393
Go away, you.

589
00:26:57,434 --> 00:26:58,593
Yous are messing.

590
00:26:58,635 --> 00:27:00,933
We are, of course.
Kay, when you're ready.

591
00:27:00,971 --> 00:27:03,496
Dee dee dee
diddly dee dee dee...

592
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,802
- Ohh!
- Whoa!

593
00:27:04,842 --> 00:27:06,537
It's a beauty, isn't it?

594
00:27:06,577 --> 00:27:08,409
Get yourself up on that.
Go on.

595
00:27:08,446 --> 00:27:09,606
What?

596
00:27:09,648 --> 00:27:10,944
It's a Stephen Roche special.

597
00:27:10,982 --> 00:27:12,347
Oh, yous are still messing.

598
00:27:12,384 --> 00:27:13,748
'Course we are.

599
00:27:13,784 --> 00:27:15,946
Dee dee dee
diddly dee dee dee...

600
00:27:15,988 --> 00:27:17,615
Whoa! Ohh!

601
00:27:17,656 --> 00:27:20,683
Whoa, ho ho ho!

602
00:27:20,727 --> 00:27:22,421
Throw your leg
over that one, what.

603
00:27:22,461 --> 00:27:25,090
- Sorry, Sharon.
- It's a Raleigh!

604
00:27:25,131 --> 00:27:26,428
'Course. Only the best.

605
00:27:26,465 --> 00:27:28,434
It's not the best, though.
Peugot are.

606
00:27:28,468 --> 00:27:30,561
You ungrateful little bollix.
Give me that back.

607
00:27:30,603 --> 00:27:32,332
- No, give it!
- Give me that back!

608
00:27:32,373 --> 00:27:33,565
I want to keep it, Dad.
Give it!

609
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:40,878
It's a bit embarrassing,
really.

610
00:27:42,882 --> 00:27:45,283
But I heard him
talking about Sharon.

611
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:49,014
Your Sharon, like, on Sunday.

612
00:27:51,626 --> 00:27:53,559
What was he saying
about Sharon?

613
00:27:54,963 --> 00:27:57,431
He said she was
a great little ride.

614
00:28:03,305 --> 00:28:05,035
My God.

615
00:28:06,776 --> 00:28:07,936
What...

616
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:11,469
You wouldn't want to be
listening to that fella.

617
00:28:11,514 --> 00:28:15,576
I only told you 'cause...

618
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:16,949
I don't know
why I told you, really.

619
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,249
You were right.

620
00:28:18,287 --> 00:28:19,653
It's pathetic.

621
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,419
A grown man talking like that.

622
00:28:21,457 --> 00:28:22,823
Exactly.

623
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,384
Just 'cause she's up the pole.

624
00:28:26,731 --> 00:28:27,891
Exactly.

625
00:28:27,932 --> 00:28:29,194
It's stupid.

626
00:28:29,233 --> 00:28:30,427
Yeah.

627
00:28:30,468 --> 00:28:31,628
You wouldn't
want to be getting...

628
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:33,102
worked up about it.

629
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:34,400
Still, though...

630
00:28:36,442 --> 00:28:38,773
It's just...

631
00:28:38,811 --> 00:28:40,642
I heard something.

632
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,044
I thought I should warn you.

633
00:28:42,081 --> 00:28:45,107
- Warn me?
- Yeah, warn you.

634
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,880
You know your man,
George Burgess?

635
00:28:48,288 --> 00:28:49,880
What about Mr. Burgess?

636
00:28:49,924 --> 00:28:52,392
He was saying things.

637
00:28:52,425 --> 00:28:53,654
Not to me face.

638
00:28:53,693 --> 00:28:56,322
It was Lester who told me.

639
00:28:56,364 --> 00:28:58,525
He was saying things...

640
00:28:58,566 --> 00:29:00,090
about you being pregnant.

641
00:29:01,569 --> 00:29:03,036
What was he saying?

642
00:29:06,107 --> 00:29:08,338
He said...

643
00:29:08,377 --> 00:29:10,368
he said you were
a great little ride.

644
00:29:11,581 --> 00:29:14,276
So Lester says, anyway.

645
00:29:14,317 --> 00:29:16,375
Lester wouldn't make a thing
up like that, would he?

646
00:29:16,418 --> 00:29:18,751
Jesus, no.
Not Lester. Never.

647
00:29:18,787 --> 00:29:20,255
Ah, well...

648
00:29:21,924 --> 00:29:23,119
You're not upset, are you?

649
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,127
No. Being called a ride's...

650
00:29:25,162 --> 00:29:26,993
a bit of a compliment,
really, isn't it?

651
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,330
Jesus, I don't know about that.

652
00:29:30,734 --> 00:29:33,329
Anyway, he shouldn't be
saying things like that.

653
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,838
Sure, men are always saying
things like that about girls.

654
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:37,239
But not about daughters.

655
00:29:37,274 --> 00:29:39,505
Don't be thick, Da.
All girls are daughters.

656
00:29:39,543 --> 00:29:41,137
Well, not my fucking daughters,
then.

657
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,409
That's hypocritical.

658
00:29:43,447 --> 00:29:45,678
I don't give a shite
what it is.

659
00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:49,313
He has daughters of his own.
That young one, your friend.

660
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:50,515
Yvonne?

661
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:51,989
Yeah, that's right.

662
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:53,287
It's shocking!

663
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,192
I don't want some
fat little fucker...

664
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,857
insulting any of my family.

665
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,389
Especially not you.

666
00:30:02,435 --> 00:30:04,335
You're me knight
in shining armor.

667
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,804
Ah, don't start that.

668
00:30:08,775 --> 00:30:10,366
I just thought
I should let you know.

669
00:30:31,066 --> 00:30:32,226
Is your daddy there?

670
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:33,427
Yeah.

671
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,629
Can I see him
for a minute?

672
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,070
He's still having his tea.

673
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,641
Is it George you want, Sharon?

674
00:30:40,677 --> 00:30:42,577
Yeah, Mrs. Burgess.

675
00:30:42,613 --> 00:30:44,842
About Darren. He's sick.

676
00:30:44,881 --> 00:30:47,077
Ah. Go on
into the lounge, love.

677
00:30:59,263 --> 00:31:00,595
She's in here, is she?

678
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:01,826
Yeah.

679
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:15,173
What the hell do you think
you're up to, you little bitch?

680
00:31:15,215 --> 00:31:17,080
What do you think you're up to,
you little bastard?

681
00:31:17,118 --> 00:31:18,516
What?

682
00:31:18,552 --> 00:31:19,986
What did you say
about me to your friends?

683
00:31:20,021 --> 00:31:21,853
I didn't say anything to anyone.

684
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:24,450
You said I was a ride.
I'm a great little ride.

685
00:31:24,492 --> 00:31:25,959
I was only joking.

686
00:31:25,995 --> 00:31:28,486
You got your hole.
What else did you say?

687
00:31:28,531 --> 00:31:31,023
Nothing.
Not another thing.

688
00:31:31,067 --> 00:31:32,623
I swear on the Bible.

689
00:31:32,668 --> 00:31:36,069
Sure, they'd never
believe I got me...

690
00:31:36,105 --> 00:31:38,471
had... with you.

691
00:31:38,508 --> 00:31:40,908
They'd think I was joking.

692
00:31:40,944 --> 00:31:43,173
If you ever blab out
and tell anyone again...

693
00:31:43,214 --> 00:31:45,704
I'll tell Mrs. Burgess
what you did. I will.

694
00:31:45,749 --> 00:31:47,740
I... I won't. D-don't worry.

695
00:31:49,152 --> 00:31:52,714
I'm sorry.

696
00:31:52,757 --> 00:31:54,122
So you should be.

697
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,990
I don't mind being pregnant...

698
00:31:56,027 --> 00:31:58,724
but I do mind people knowing
who made me pregnant.

699
00:31:58,764 --> 00:32:00,629
Hang on a sec.

700
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:03,494
I'll be back in a minute.

701
00:32:12,378 --> 00:32:14,574
- How are you, Sharon?
- How ya, Yvonne?

702
00:32:15,581 --> 00:32:16,741
Where's me dad?

703
00:32:16,783 --> 00:32:18,613
He went out to get
something for Darren.

704
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,209
Oh. Me hair.

705
00:32:20,253 --> 00:32:21,810
I'll see you later
in the pub, all right?

706
00:32:21,853 --> 00:32:23,015
Yeah. See you later.

707
00:32:23,057 --> 00:32:24,819
Ah, Yvonne. You saw Sharon.

708
00:32:24,857 --> 00:32:26,086
Darren is sick.

709
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:27,490
We'll miss him on Saturday.

710
00:32:27,527 --> 00:32:30,190
He's turned into
a right good little goalkeeper.

711
00:32:35,737 --> 00:32:37,328
That was close.

712
00:32:42,343 --> 00:32:44,072
That's for yourself, Sharon.

713
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,705
Do you think I'm a prostitute,
Mr. Burgess?

714
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:50,515
God, no! Jesus, no!

715
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:52,248
It's not the way
you think, Sharon.

716
00:32:52,287 --> 00:32:53,449
Oh, shite.

717
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:57,324
No, it's a present.
No hard feelings.

718
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,922
We both made a mistake.
We were both stupid.

719
00:33:01,964 --> 00:33:05,298
Now, go and buy yourself
a few sweets, uh, drinks.

720
00:33:06,436 --> 00:33:10,134
You're an awful bleedin' eejit,
Mr. Burgess.

721
00:33:10,174 --> 00:33:12,609
Put your tenner
back in your pocket.

722
00:33:12,644 --> 00:33:13,941
OK.

723
00:33:13,978 --> 00:33:15,673
Sorry.

724
00:33:15,713 --> 00:33:17,078
Oh, yeah.

725
00:33:17,115 --> 00:33:18,605
I, uh...

726
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,675
I kept these for you.
Your panties.

727
00:33:20,718 --> 00:33:22,812
- Isn't that what you call them?
- Me knickers?

728
00:33:22,855 --> 00:33:24,949
Yeah, I was just keeping them
for you in case they get lost.

729
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,355
- What were you doing with them?
- Nothing.

730
00:33:26,392 --> 00:33:27,587
Don't start that.

731
00:33:28,594 --> 00:33:30,563
I was going to show them
to the lads.

732
00:33:30,597 --> 00:33:31,996
Oh, my God!

733
00:33:32,032 --> 00:33:34,057
- But I didn't.
- I've changed me mind.

734
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,362
Give us back the tenner.
I deserve it.

735
00:33:35,402 --> 00:33:37,633
- Certainly. There you are.
- And remember...

736
00:33:37,671 --> 00:33:39,230
if you ever say anything
to anyone again about me...

737
00:33:39,273 --> 00:33:40,706
I'm going to tell Mrs. Burgess.

738
00:34:05,101 --> 00:34:07,228
Ah, there you are, Dessie.
How's it going?

739
00:34:08,705 --> 00:34:10,400
You keep your hands off me.

740
00:34:10,441 --> 00:34:12,533
What's wrong with you?

741
00:34:12,576 --> 00:34:15,136
You know bleedin' well
what's wrong with me!

742
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,669
You were saying things
about Sharon!

743
00:34:16,714 --> 00:34:18,147
No, you got it wrong, Dessie.

744
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,616
- Wrong? Me bollix!
- No, honestly. I swear!

745
00:34:20,652 --> 00:34:22,119
Me bollix!

746
00:34:23,388 --> 00:34:24,684
I'm sorry, Dessie.

747
00:34:24,723 --> 00:34:25,883
You should be
ashamed of yourself...

748
00:34:25,924 --> 00:34:27,391
an old thing like you.

749
00:34:27,424 --> 00:34:28,950
Saying things like that
about young girls.

750
00:34:28,994 --> 00:34:31,690
- I... I know.
- You're not worth hitting.

751
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:33,027
Dessie, I'm sorry.

752
00:34:33,065 --> 00:34:34,999
Really, on the Bible.

753
00:34:36,801 --> 00:34:38,770
I was just messing
with the lads.

754
00:34:38,803 --> 00:34:41,465
The lads.
You sound like a kid.

755
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,375
If you ever say anything
about Sharon again...

756
00:34:47,413 --> 00:34:48,573
I'll kill you, right.

757
00:34:48,614 --> 00:34:50,707
No, no, I... I won't.
You needn't worry about...

758
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,981
and if you drop Darren
from the football team...

759
00:34:53,019 --> 00:34:55,351
because of this,
I'll bleedin' kill you, too!

760
00:35:16,878 --> 00:35:18,608
Jesus, sorry.

761
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,779
The one you said
I could do without

762
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,755
Well, we're in an awful mess

763
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,815
And I don't mean maybe

764
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,321
Please

765
00:35:31,361 --> 00:35:33,296
Papa, don't preach

766
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,423
I'm in trouble deep

767
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,400
Papa, don't preach

768
00:35:37,434 --> 00:35:40,029
I've been losing sleep

769
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:43,233
But I've made up my mind, ohh

770
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:46,074
I'm keeping my baby

771
00:35:47,514 --> 00:35:49,640
I'm gonna keep my baby

772
00:35:49,682 --> 00:35:52,049
Ooh, yeah

773
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,785
Ohh.

774
00:35:59,893 --> 00:36:01,520
Turn your head.

775
00:36:01,563 --> 00:36:02,928
Who did that to you?

776
00:36:02,964 --> 00:36:04,727
Me best friend!

777
00:36:04,765 --> 00:36:06,666
Fair enough. Suits you.

778
00:36:06,702 --> 00:36:09,602
See, I told you.
It looks lovely!

779
00:36:09,638 --> 00:36:12,333
Pat says his dad's after
running away from home.

780
00:36:12,374 --> 00:36:14,204
- Pat who?
- Burgess.

781
00:36:14,243 --> 00:36:16,473
Georgie Burgess is
after running away from home?

782
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,606
Yeah. Pat's ma's up to 90.

783
00:36:18,647 --> 00:36:20,478
He said she's knocking
back the Valiums...

784
00:36:20,516 --> 00:36:21,677
like there's no tomorrow.

785
00:36:21,717 --> 00:36:22,878
She would be.

786
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:24,716
Lend her some of yours, Ma.

787
00:36:24,754 --> 00:36:25,913
Poor Doris.

788
00:36:25,956 --> 00:36:27,253
That's a good one, though, huh?
Ha ha.

789
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:28,724
Do you know
where he's gone, Darren?

790
00:36:28,758 --> 00:36:31,591
No.
Pat said he just snuck out.

791
00:36:31,629 --> 00:36:33,460
Tom Sawyer, what.

792
00:36:33,498 --> 00:36:35,125
That's made my day.

793
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:37,691
Fixed. Tom Sawyer Burgess.

794
00:36:37,735 --> 00:36:39,795
Oh, Jesus!

795
00:36:39,837 --> 00:36:42,432
He must have a mot
hidden away somewhere.

796
00:36:42,474 --> 00:36:43,941
Sם, senor.

797
00:36:43,976 --> 00:36:45,374
Who'd look at him?

798
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:46,934
The state of him.

799
00:36:46,979 --> 00:36:49,607
Have you
looked at yourself recently?

800
00:36:49,649 --> 00:36:51,275
I'm not running away, am I?

801
00:36:51,316 --> 00:36:54,114
And shirking
me responsibilities.

802
00:36:54,152 --> 00:36:55,586
He's not that bad.

803
00:36:55,622 --> 00:36:57,646
You fancy him yourself, do you?

804
00:36:57,688 --> 00:36:58,849
No!

805
00:36:58,891 --> 00:37:00,256
Lester fancies younger lads.

806
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:01,520
Isn't that right, Lester?

807
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,050
Lay off, would you?

808
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,495
I can't understand it meself.

809
00:37:05,532 --> 00:37:09,332
You know, the way queers...

810
00:37:09,368 --> 00:37:10,802
like each other.

811
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:12,304
Do you think about it much?

812
00:37:12,338 --> 00:37:13,863
No.

813
00:37:13,907 --> 00:37:15,807
Nearly never.

814
00:37:15,842 --> 00:37:17,435
Lay off, would yous?

815
00:37:17,478 --> 00:37:20,970
So, Senor Burgess has vamoosed.

816
00:37:21,015 --> 00:37:24,416
And shirked
his responsibilities.

817
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,147
Don't start, you.

818
00:37:26,187 --> 00:37:28,678
Poor Doris.
And the kids.

819
00:37:28,723 --> 00:37:30,657
Why don't you adopt them?

820
00:37:30,692 --> 00:37:32,251
Ha ha ha.

821
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:34,991
Do you ever...
Leave me alone.

822
00:37:35,031 --> 00:37:36,190
Ha ha ha.

823
00:37:36,232 --> 00:37:38,757
Jesus. Poor Yvonne, though.

824
00:37:38,801 --> 00:37:39,995
Yeah.

825
00:37:42,338 --> 00:37:44,169
Maybe we should
go round to her.

826
00:37:44,207 --> 00:37:45,503
Ah, no.

827
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:47,032
Yeah, I'd be too embarrassed.

828
00:37:47,078 --> 00:37:48,237
Yeah.

829
00:37:48,278 --> 00:37:49,677
Is Craig with Yvonne, Sharon?

830
00:37:49,714 --> 00:37:51,578
Don't know. Didn't see him.

831
00:37:51,615 --> 00:37:54,176
Can you imagine it?
Your da!

832
00:37:54,217 --> 00:37:55,981
Jesus! Ha ha ha.

833
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,680
Jesus, yeah.

834
00:38:03,562 --> 00:38:05,860
Sharon! Sharon!

835
00:38:05,897 --> 00:38:08,423
Oh, Sharon,
there's someone outside.

836
00:38:11,905 --> 00:38:13,064
Who?

837
00:38:13,105 --> 00:38:15,596
I don't know.
I'm not looking.

838
00:38:15,642 --> 00:38:17,132
A pervert, probably.

839
00:38:20,647 --> 00:38:21,841
God.

840
00:38:26,186 --> 00:38:27,347
Oh, Janey.

841
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,547
Shh!

842
00:38:29,925 --> 00:38:31,255
Just shut up!

843
00:38:43,805 --> 00:38:45,864
Who is it?

844
00:38:45,908 --> 00:38:48,570
Just some
young fellas messing.

845
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:50,705
Messing!
At this hour of night.

846
00:38:50,748 --> 00:38:51,941
Give me a look.

847
00:38:52,949 --> 00:38:55,110
They're gone.

848
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:57,245
What young fellas?

849
00:38:57,287 --> 00:38:58,981
They're gone, Lisa.

850
00:38:59,023 --> 00:39:00,615
They'd better not
have been looking for me.

851
00:39:00,658 --> 00:39:01,920
I'll kill them.

852
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:04,519
Return to sender

853
00:39:04,561 --> 00:39:07,258
Address unknown

854
00:39:07,298 --> 00:39:09,391
No such number

855
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:10,992
No such zone

856
00:39:11,035 --> 00:39:13,095
Ma!

857
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:15,539
"I hope
you will understand, Doris.

858
00:39:15,574 --> 00:39:18,475
"I cannot abandon this girl.

859
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:21,605
"A-b-a-n-d-o-n.

860
00:39:21,647 --> 00:39:24,615
"She has no one else
to look after her.

861
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,083
"Full stop."

862
00:39:26,117 --> 00:39:28,143
Dirty-looking eejit.

863
00:39:28,187 --> 00:39:31,645
"I am, as the old song goes...

864
00:39:31,692 --> 00:39:34,991
"torn between two lovers.

865
00:39:35,027 --> 00:39:37,792
"P.S.
The paper is my sister's."

866
00:39:57,552 --> 00:39:59,282
Sharon Curley.

867
00:40:16,507 --> 00:40:17,769
Doris.

868
00:40:21,778 --> 00:40:23,270
Is your Sharon here?

869
00:40:23,314 --> 00:40:25,613
She's at work, Doris.

870
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,618
Why? Why do you want her?

871
00:40:27,652 --> 00:40:29,678
Well, if you must know...

872
00:40:29,722 --> 00:40:32,350
she's been messing around
with my George.

873
00:40:32,392 --> 00:40:34,952
- He's the father.
- Get lost.

874
00:40:34,994 --> 00:40:37,019
I will not get lost.

875
00:40:37,063 --> 00:40:38,326
She's your daughter.

876
00:40:38,365 --> 00:40:39,855
Go home, will you?

877
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,459
Of course.
I should've known.

878
00:40:42,503 --> 00:40:43,993
She's her mother's daughter.

879
00:40:57,486 --> 00:40:59,317
What's after happening, Doris?

880
00:40:59,355 --> 00:41:02,256
Your woman hit her.
You seen it yourself.

881
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:04,452
I mean before that.

882
00:41:04,493 --> 00:41:06,121
What happened, Doris?

883
00:41:06,162 --> 00:41:10,725
Kay Curley gave her
a terrible clapper on the nose.

884
00:41:10,766 --> 00:41:12,928
I'll do it meself.

885
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:16,029
What did she do that for,
Doris?

886
00:41:16,072 --> 00:41:18,268
Sharon.

887
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,503
What?

888
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:23,642
Sharon Curley!

889
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:25,909
Feck off.

890
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:28,581
You're joking!

891
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,488
No way. No way.

892
00:41:33,526 --> 00:41:34,787
No way!

893
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:40,655
Ah, Jesus Christ!

894
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:44,034
Are you all right, Sharon?

895
00:41:51,578 --> 00:41:55,480
Jesus, Kay,
that bastard's older than I am.

896
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:58,678
Georgie Burgess.

897
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:00,846
I can't even go for a pint now.

898
00:42:00,888 --> 00:42:02,855
About time you stayed in.

899
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:05,120
I'll see yous. I'm just
going over to Yvonne's.

900
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:08,595
I'd make alternative
arrangements if I were you.

901
00:42:08,629 --> 00:42:10,392
Oh, Jesus.

902
00:42:10,432 --> 00:42:14,630
Can you forgive me?

903
00:42:16,105 --> 00:42:17,662
Ooh, yeah

904
00:42:19,308 --> 00:42:20,774
Ha ha ha ha!

905
00:42:31,854 --> 00:42:33,687
Olי

906
00:42:33,724 --> 00:42:37,354
Olי, olי, olי, olי

907
00:42:37,395 --> 00:42:41,161
Olי, olי

908
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:44,600
Olי, olי, olי, olי, olי

909
00:42:44,636 --> 00:42:48,835
Olי, olי

910
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:00,051
Are you all right, Sharon?

911
00:43:00,085 --> 00:43:01,747
A man.

912
00:43:18,773 --> 00:43:20,207
Is that you squeaking?

913
00:43:20,242 --> 00:43:21,401
No.

914
00:43:24,112 --> 00:43:26,604
Ah.

915
00:43:26,648 --> 00:43:29,117
Oh. Ohh.

916
00:43:34,857 --> 00:43:36,051
Oh.

917
00:43:38,662 --> 00:43:39,855
Ohh.

918
00:43:42,566 --> 00:43:44,033
That was A-one.

919
00:43:50,075 --> 00:43:51,541
Good girl.

920
00:43:58,683 --> 00:44:00,081
Who was that?

921
00:44:00,118 --> 00:44:02,086
- Sharon, are you coming?
- I'm coming.

922
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,450
Hurry up, will you!

923
00:44:08,627 --> 00:44:10,594
- How in the...
- It wasn't him.

924
00:44:10,628 --> 00:44:12,460
- I never said it was.
- It wasn't him, right!

925
00:44:12,497 --> 00:44:13,691
OK, OK.

926
00:44:19,438 --> 00:44:20,666
Well, if it wasn't Burgess...

927
00:44:20,707 --> 00:44:22,833
It wasn't bleedin' Burgess!

928
00:44:33,454 --> 00:44:35,547
George Burgess!

929
00:44:36,692 --> 00:44:38,887
Shite.

930
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,951
True as I'm standing here.

931
00:44:40,995 --> 00:44:42,623
She's having it for him.

932
00:44:42,663 --> 00:44:43,961
They're getting a flat.

933
00:44:43,998 --> 00:44:45,626
Jesus!

934
00:44:45,667 --> 00:44:47,692
Shirley, come here. Listen.

935
00:44:47,735 --> 00:44:49,636
You know your woman
who's preggers?

936
00:44:49,671 --> 00:44:52,606
Guess who's the da?
Mr. Burgess!

937
00:45:00,351 --> 00:45:02,113
Look it!

938
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:04,848
Hey, slut!

939
00:45:04,889 --> 00:45:06,858
How's Mr. Burgess?

940
00:45:06,891 --> 00:45:08,086
Slut!

941
00:45:28,783 --> 00:45:30,808
Take it back!

942
00:45:30,852 --> 00:45:32,910
Take it back,
you fucking bastard!

943
00:45:33,922 --> 00:45:37,290
Hey, baby,
it's your Georgie Porgie

944
00:45:37,325 --> 00:45:39,350
Let me tell you
where I've been

945
00:45:39,394 --> 00:45:41,089
Let me tell you
where they've been

946
00:45:41,129 --> 00:45:44,497
Hey, baby,
it's your Georgie Porgie

947
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,692
Oh, look here, she's coming.

948
00:45:45,734 --> 00:45:47,168
Oh, here's the tart again.

949
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:48,636
Stupid old Curley.

950
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:49,865
Up the spout again.

951
00:45:57,746 --> 00:45:59,374
Sharon!

952
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:01,681
Wait, will you? Hang on!

953
00:46:02,886 --> 00:46:04,980
Close your mouth there,
Mrs. O'Leary.

954
00:46:05,022 --> 00:46:07,012
The birds'll
start nesting in it.

955
00:46:08,292 --> 00:46:10,317
There's no bleedin' way,
Jackie. You know that.

956
00:46:10,362 --> 00:46:12,852
I know. I know that!

957
00:46:12,897 --> 00:46:16,128
Jesus, the state of him.
There's no way you'd have...

958
00:46:16,168 --> 00:46:19,262
Don't say it.
I'll get sick, I swear.

959
00:46:19,303 --> 00:46:21,669
Jeez, can you imagine it?
Jesus.

960
00:46:21,706 --> 00:46:23,334
That big fat belly
on top of you.

961
00:46:23,374 --> 00:46:24,535
Stop!

962
00:46:26,445 --> 00:46:27,639
You telling?

963
00:46:29,314 --> 00:46:31,578
I suppose I'd better.

964
00:46:31,617 --> 00:46:33,916
Jesus, Sharon. Come on.

965
00:46:37,992 --> 00:46:40,357
It was one of them
Spanish sailors.

966
00:46:40,393 --> 00:46:42,953
- What?
- You know. You do.

967
00:46:42,996 --> 00:46:44,225
In town.

968
00:46:44,265 --> 00:46:46,358
There was a big boat,
you know, in the docks...

969
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,766
for two days I think it was.

970
00:46:47,801 --> 00:46:50,201
Oh, he was gorgeous, Jackie,
I'm not joking you.

971
00:46:50,238 --> 00:46:52,467
Was he? Jesus!

972
00:46:52,506 --> 00:46:54,168
You never mentioned him before.

973
00:46:54,209 --> 00:46:55,403
I didn't want to.

974
00:46:55,442 --> 00:46:57,638
And now I have to.
It was only for one night.

975
00:46:57,679 --> 00:46:59,477
Yeah. Do you know his address?

976
00:46:59,514 --> 00:47:01,107
I don't even know
his bleedin' name, Jackie!

977
00:47:04,486 --> 00:47:05,715
In a hotel.

978
00:47:05,755 --> 00:47:07,244
Jesus.

979
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:08,451
Lovely.

980
00:47:08,491 --> 00:47:09,982
Like "Letter to Brezhnev."

981
00:47:10,026 --> 00:47:12,392
God, yeah.
I never thought of that.

982
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:15,421
Jesus.
He nearly had me screaming.

983
00:47:15,464 --> 00:47:17,593
I'm not joking! Ha ha ha!

984
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:19,602
We did it in the bath as well!

985
00:47:19,635 --> 00:47:21,662
Aah!

986
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:24,334
- It was brilliant.
- Oh, God.

987
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:27,276
I'd love that.

988
00:47:28,313 --> 00:47:29,506
Come here.

989
00:47:30,983 --> 00:47:32,814
Did he give you his cap?

990
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:35,546
- What?
- His cap.

991
00:47:35,588 --> 00:47:37,818
You know, his uniform.

992
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:40,552
- Uh, no.
- Did he not?

993
00:47:40,593 --> 00:47:42,357
You know Melanie Beglin?

994
00:47:42,395 --> 00:47:43,827
She has two of them.

995
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:46,024
A German and a Swedish.

996
00:47:46,066 --> 00:47:49,160
- Does she?
- Yeah. She's a slut, that one.

997
00:47:49,202 --> 00:47:52,228
Jesus, sorry, Sharon.
I didn't mean...

998
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:57,978
I don't know what
she has to laugh at.

999
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:04,110
You don't hear me laughing,
do you?

1000
00:48:04,152 --> 00:48:05,482
Thank God.

1001
00:48:09,926 --> 00:48:12,257
Lower that thing, will you?!

1002
00:48:12,294 --> 00:48:14,990
You can live
any way you want...

1003
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:17,328
She can go and laugh
somewhere else.

1004
00:48:17,367 --> 00:48:19,336
Jesus, me heart!

1005
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:20,859
Was that one of ours?

1006
00:48:20,903 --> 00:48:23,338
Wait a minute. Hold on.

1007
00:48:23,373 --> 00:48:24,567
Where was it?

1008
00:48:25,709 --> 00:48:27,403
Burgess!

1009
00:48:27,443 --> 00:48:30,072
Burgess, you bastard, you!

1010
00:48:30,114 --> 00:48:31,605
Come on out!

1011
00:48:31,649 --> 00:48:33,344
Come on!

1012
00:48:33,384 --> 00:48:34,875
Will you come on!

1013
00:48:34,919 --> 00:48:36,613
Stay out of this, you.

1014
00:48:36,654 --> 00:48:38,020
Come out, Burgess!

1015
00:48:38,056 --> 00:48:39,955
Get in here, you gobshite!

1016
00:48:39,992 --> 00:48:41,821
Craig, love, come on home.

1017
00:48:41,859 --> 00:48:43,884
He's not in there, you eejit!

1018
00:48:43,928 --> 00:48:46,226
I'm doing this for you,
you slut!

1019
00:48:46,264 --> 00:48:47,423
Come out!

1020
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,531
Oh, yeah. Come on!

1021
00:48:51,935 --> 00:48:54,097
Right, come on!

1022
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,973
Come on!

1023
00:48:57,008 --> 00:48:58,374
Fucking knock me down!

1024
00:48:58,411 --> 00:49:00,845
Go to hell! Come on!

1025
00:49:00,879 --> 00:49:02,142
Janey Mac!

1026
00:49:02,182 --> 00:49:03,341
Come on!

1027
00:49:03,382 --> 00:49:05,247
Come on. In.

1028
00:49:05,285 --> 00:49:06,615
In, in. Get in.

1029
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:07,813
Jesus!

1030
00:49:14,561 --> 00:49:18,794
Do not forsake me,
oh, my darling

1031
00:49:20,302 --> 00:49:25,204
On this our wedding day

1032
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:27,434
Do not forsake me

1033
00:49:30,646 --> 00:49:32,409
Do you know what, sergeant?

1034
00:49:32,449 --> 00:49:34,279
He done it deliberately.

1035
00:49:34,316 --> 00:49:36,876
He backed right over her.

1036
00:49:36,919 --> 00:49:38,820
Oh, God, the poor little thing.

1037
00:49:38,855 --> 00:49:40,822
And all 'cause
I gave him shepherd's pie...

1038
00:49:40,856 --> 00:49:42,722
two nights on the trot.
Tsk, tsk.

1039
00:49:42,759 --> 00:49:45,751
But I have the evidence
here now.

1040
00:49:47,063 --> 00:49:48,258
Oh, God.

1041
00:49:49,735 --> 00:49:51,168
Spanish, no less!

1042
00:49:51,203 --> 00:49:52,500
Yeah. Spanish.

1043
00:49:52,536 --> 00:49:55,631
An Irish sailor wasn't
good enough for you, what?

1044
00:49:55,674 --> 00:49:57,643
And will Sinbad
the Spanish sailor...

1045
00:49:57,676 --> 00:50:00,407
pay for Burgess's
broken windows, I wonder?

1046
00:50:07,019 --> 00:50:08,613
Will he be much longer,
do you think?

1047
00:50:08,655 --> 00:50:11,249
That depends on himself.

1048
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,820
Well, I have
a few sandwiches for him.

1049
00:50:14,863 --> 00:50:16,125
What are they?

1050
00:50:16,163 --> 00:50:17,425
Uh, ham.

1051
00:50:19,567 --> 00:50:21,432
I'll see he gets them.

1052
00:50:26,976 --> 00:50:28,237
Thanks.

1053
00:50:36,787 --> 00:50:39,120
Spanish sailor, me arse.

1054
00:50:44,728 --> 00:50:46,355
She's a lying, fucking bitch!

1055
00:50:46,396 --> 00:50:49,560
- Ah, look at you.
- I don't care what you say!

1056
00:50:51,669 --> 00:50:55,036
I'm Pedro the sailor man

1057
00:50:56,274 --> 00:50:57,673
Toot, toot

1058
00:51:07,686 --> 00:51:09,118
Sharon?

1059
00:51:09,153 --> 00:51:11,588
Are you sure the baby
won't look like Mr. Burgess?

1060
00:51:11,622 --> 00:51:13,853
No, he won't!
He's not the daddy, Kimberley.

1061
00:51:13,893 --> 00:51:15,792
I told you that.
Who said that, anyway?

1062
00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:16,989
Nicola Malley.

1063
00:51:17,029 --> 00:51:18,930
Well, you tell Nicola Malley
to piss off.

1064
00:51:18,965 --> 00:51:20,330
- I did already.
- Good.

1065
00:51:20,366 --> 00:51:22,459
And I scraped her face as well.

1066
00:51:22,503 --> 00:51:23,662
Good.

1067
00:51:23,703 --> 00:51:25,535
And I scribbled
all over her sums.

1068
00:51:25,573 --> 00:51:26,732
Brilliant.

1069
00:51:26,773 --> 00:51:28,036
Look out, Sharon.

1070
00:51:55,037 --> 00:51:56,868
- Hello, Sharon.
- How'd you know I was here?

1071
00:51:56,906 --> 00:51:58,704
Did you not see me
over by the vegetables?

1072
00:51:58,742 --> 00:51:59,901
What do you want?

1073
00:51:59,943 --> 00:52:01,843
I want to talk to you, Sharon.

1074
00:52:01,879 --> 00:52:03,039
Well, that's a pity,
Mr. Burgess...

1075
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,239
'cause I don't want
to talk to you.

1076
00:52:04,281 --> 00:52:07,375
Ah, Sharon, please.
I have to talk. I'm tormented.

1077
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:08,578
You're tormented?

1078
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,382
You've made me
the laughingstock of Barrytown.

1079
00:52:10,421 --> 00:52:12,116
I can't go out
without being jeered at.

1080
00:52:12,156 --> 00:52:14,090
You're tormented?
You prick, you!

1081
00:52:14,126 --> 00:52:15,353
Please, Sharon, please.

1082
00:52:15,394 --> 00:52:16,553
What?

1083
00:52:16,594 --> 00:52:18,153
Come on, I'm in a hurry.

1084
00:52:18,196 --> 00:52:19,960
Sharon...

1085
00:52:19,999 --> 00:52:21,796
Sharon, I love you, Sharon.

1086
00:52:21,834 --> 00:52:24,530
Don't laugh at me. I do.

1087
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:27,164
On the Bible, I love you.

1088
00:52:27,206 --> 00:52:29,902
I'm very embarrassed, Sharon.

1089
00:52:29,943 --> 00:52:32,241
I think I want
to take care of you, Sharon.

1090
00:52:32,279 --> 00:52:34,440
You took care of me
seven months ago.

1091
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,347
It's my son, too, remember.

1092
00:52:36,383 --> 00:52:38,909
- Son?
- Baby. I... I meant baby.

1093
00:52:38,953 --> 00:52:40,112
Your baby?

1094
00:52:40,154 --> 00:52:41,849
You have it bad,
haven't you, Mr. Burgess?

1095
00:52:41,889 --> 00:52:44,415
Yeah. Yeah,
I have been living a lie...

1096
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:45,948
for the past fifteen years.

1097
00:52:45,993 --> 00:52:47,985
It's taken you
to make me cop on, Sharon.

1098
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:49,360
Did you rehearse this,
Mr. Burgess?

1099
00:52:49,397 --> 00:52:52,026
No! Yeah.

1100
00:52:52,066 --> 00:52:53,432
Well, I've been thinking...

1101
00:52:53,469 --> 00:52:55,799
of nothing else,
to be honest with you.

1102
00:52:55,837 --> 00:52:57,600
Come to London with me, Sharon.

1103
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,972
I've a sister over there.

1104
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:02,306
Would you ever?
Feck off!

1105
00:53:02,344 --> 00:53:04,905
Sharon, please!
Let me finish!

1106
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:06,643
No. I'm not going anywhere
with you, Mr. Burgess.

1107
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,982
I'm staying here.
Anyway, it's not your baby.

1108
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,383
Is it because
I'm older than you?

1109
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,820
It's because I hate
the bleedin' sight of you!

1110
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,152
You're not just sayin' that?

1111
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,055
No, I hate you!
Will I sing it for you?

1112
00:53:15,093 --> 00:53:17,322
- What about the little baby?
- Forget about the little baby!

1113
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:18,794
If you must know,
you were off target!

1114
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:21,298
- I was not!
- You were, so there!

1115
00:53:21,332 --> 00:53:24,267
It was a Spanish sailor,
if you must know!

1116
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:25,529
Spanish?!

1117
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:27,298
I sleep around, Mr. Burgess,
you know what I mean?

1118
00:53:27,339 --> 00:53:29,101
I find that hard to believe,
Sharon.

1119
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:31,267
Go home, Mr. Burgess.
Go home!

1120
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:32,674
Sharon, please...

1121
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,679
Will you shut up before you make
an even bigger sap of yourself!

1122
00:53:34,713 --> 00:53:36,009
Go home!

1123
00:53:36,047 --> 00:53:38,572
All right. OK.

1124
00:53:38,617 --> 00:53:41,848
It'll be our secret, Sharon.

1125
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:45,186
I'll always remember you,
Sharon!

1126
00:53:45,223 --> 00:53:48,591
You met this young fella,
you... you "clicked"...

1127
00:53:48,629 --> 00:53:51,028
and you went to a hotel room...

1128
00:53:51,063 --> 00:53:53,657
and you're telling me
you can't remember his name?

1129
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,997
I was drunk, I said.

1130
00:53:55,036 --> 00:53:56,195
I was drunk
when I met your mother!

1131
00:53:56,236 --> 00:53:57,704
I still remember her name!
It's Kay!

1132
00:53:57,738 --> 00:53:58,898
Don't shout.

1133
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:00,703
Look, I was really drunk.
Pissed!

1134
00:54:00,742 --> 00:54:02,174
Sorry, Mummy.

1135
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:04,678
How do you know
he was Spanish then?

1136
00:54:04,712 --> 00:54:06,874
Or a sailor?

1137
00:54:06,915 --> 00:54:09,212
He could have been
a Pakistani postman...

1138
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:10,775
if you were that drunk!

1139
00:54:10,819 --> 00:54:11,978
Well?!

1140
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,614
You needn't believe me
if you don't want to!

1141
00:54:14,657 --> 00:54:16,648
Oh, thanks very much!

1142
00:54:30,107 --> 00:54:31,939
Will we get out?

1143
00:54:31,976 --> 00:54:33,308
No.

1144
00:54:36,348 --> 00:54:38,441
What do you think?
Do you believe her?

1145
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:41,509
I think I'll be delighted
if the father...

1146
00:54:41,554 --> 00:54:44,149
was a Spanish sailor
and not Georgie Burgess.

1147
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:45,486
God, yeah.

1148
00:54:45,525 --> 00:54:47,755
Why don't you leave her alone?

1149
00:54:47,794 --> 00:54:49,659
What do you mean?

1150
00:54:49,697 --> 00:54:51,994
If she says
he's a Spanish sailor...

1151
00:54:52,031 --> 00:54:53,522
why not let her say it?

1152
00:54:53,567 --> 00:54:54,999
What, believe her?

1153
00:54:55,035 --> 00:54:56,332
Yeah.

1154
00:54:56,371 --> 00:54:59,237
I don't know.

1155
00:54:59,274 --> 00:55:02,107
If she'd just give us
a name or something.

1156
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,404
What does it matter?

1157
00:55:03,445 --> 00:55:05,436
What?

1158
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,310
Do they believe me?

1159
00:55:07,348 --> 00:55:09,475
They do, yeah.
I think they do.

1160
00:55:09,517 --> 00:55:12,042
But it's a better gas...

1161
00:55:12,087 --> 00:55:14,215
thinkin' of Mr. Burgess
doin' it with you...

1162
00:55:14,256 --> 00:55:16,247
instead of the other fella.

1163
00:55:23,867 --> 00:55:25,562
That's what you're
fighting against, Sharon.

1164
00:55:25,601 --> 00:55:27,866
Barrytown's sense of humor.

1165
00:55:29,874 --> 00:55:32,468
Terrible smell in here,
isn't there, Mary?

1166
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:35,103
They shouldn't
let prostitutes in here.

1167
00:55:35,146 --> 00:55:36,443
I'll kill you!

1168
00:55:36,482 --> 00:55:38,541
- Don't bother! Come on!
- Hey, Yvonne...

1169
00:55:38,584 --> 00:55:39,743
Don't bother.
Just come, please.

1170
00:55:39,784 --> 00:55:40,943
Bitch.

1171
00:55:40,985 --> 00:55:43,818
I don't think
they do believe me.

1172
00:55:43,855 --> 00:55:45,015
It's him.

1173
00:55:45,056 --> 00:55:46,647
No, it's not.

1174
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:58,059
What do you think
about it, compadre mio?

1175
00:55:59,973 --> 00:56:02,133
Sorry, Bertie.
I... I wasn't listening.

1176
00:56:04,476 --> 00:56:08,140
I was lookin' at that
soccer shower over there.

1177
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:10,309
They're laughing at me.

1178
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:12,046
Ah, cop on to yourself,
will ya?

1179
00:56:12,086 --> 00:56:13,553
I'm telling you.

1180
00:56:13,586 --> 00:56:16,488
They're looking over here
and laughing.

1181
00:56:16,524 --> 00:56:18,356
There's no one laughing at you.

1182
00:56:18,392 --> 00:56:20,485
If they want,
they can bleedin' try.

1183
00:56:20,528 --> 00:56:23,794
Anyway,
it wasn't Burgess at all.

1184
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:28,667
It was a Spanish sailor now,
she says.

1185
00:56:28,703 --> 00:56:30,501
Sharon.

1186
00:56:30,539 --> 00:56:31,939
So you said.

1187
00:56:31,973 --> 00:56:34,499
Why did Burgess
do a legger, then?

1188
00:56:34,543 --> 00:56:37,604
Sם, seor.

1189
00:56:37,647 --> 00:56:39,945
Sharon's
a lovely-looking young 'un.

1190
00:56:39,982 --> 00:56:42,314
She'll have lads
queuing up for her.

1191
00:56:42,351 --> 00:56:45,549
Burgess'd never get near her.

1192
00:56:45,589 --> 00:56:47,852
I'd say it was
a Spanish sailor, all right.

1193
00:56:47,891 --> 00:56:50,382
Yes, hombre.
He speaks the truth.

1194
00:56:50,427 --> 00:56:52,952
Oh.

1195
00:56:52,996 --> 00:56:55,329
Good-lookin' lad, you know.

1196
00:56:55,366 --> 00:56:57,425
Different as well, like.

1197
00:56:57,467 --> 00:57:00,335
Dark and tall.

1198
00:57:00,371 --> 00:57:02,339
- Exotic.
- Exactly.

1199
00:57:03,776 --> 00:57:06,643
And a hefty langer on him, huh?

1200
00:57:09,281 --> 00:57:12,808
Christopher Columbus.

1201
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:20,521
Janey, he moved!

1202
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:23,052
- Of course he did.
- Give us a go.

1203
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,730
He kicked, yeah.

1204
00:57:32,174 --> 00:57:33,539
Here as well.

1205
00:57:33,574 --> 00:57:34,735
How could he?

1206
00:57:34,776 --> 00:57:38,041
He has two legs, Lisa.
Take it easy.

1207
00:57:39,448 --> 00:57:41,417
Shh.

1208
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:42,781
Shite.

1209
00:57:47,957 --> 00:57:52,394
I tell you,
but I gave as good as I got.

1210
00:57:53,631 --> 00:57:55,758
They were laughing at me,
I'm telling ya!

1211
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,993
Will you calm down?

1212
00:57:58,034 --> 00:58:00,469
Let me go!
I'll bust 'em!

1213
00:58:08,646 --> 00:58:11,047
Aren't you great?

1214
00:58:11,081 --> 00:58:13,072
I'm not going up there anymore.

1215
00:58:13,117 --> 00:58:15,984
I... I don't care!

1216
00:58:16,021 --> 00:58:19,821
I can't enjoy me pint
under them conditions.

1217
00:58:19,857 --> 00:58:21,826
Georgie Burgess!

1218
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:23,726
Oh, shut up.
I'm sick of it.

1219
00:58:23,762 --> 00:58:25,195
Here, Sharon.

1220
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:26,720
Your da's after
been defending your honor.

1221
00:58:26,766 --> 00:58:29,097
- Isn't he great?
- What happened to you?

1222
00:58:29,134 --> 00:58:31,160
Nothing, Sharon. Nothing.

1223
00:58:31,203 --> 00:58:33,434
Don't mind your mother.
She's been at the sherry again.

1224
00:58:33,472 --> 00:58:34,632
Were you in a fight?

1225
00:58:34,674 --> 00:58:36,165
No, not really.

1226
00:58:36,209 --> 00:58:38,142
What happened? Yeah?

1227
00:58:38,177 --> 00:58:40,305
Well...

1228
00:58:40,347 --> 00:58:41,940
they were saying things.

1229
00:58:41,982 --> 00:58:46,612
I won't let anyone...
anyone... jeer Sharon.

1230
00:58:46,654 --> 00:58:48,053
I don't care who they are.

1231
00:58:48,089 --> 00:58:49,885
You're a bleedin' eejit.
Why didn't you ignore them?

1232
00:58:49,924 --> 00:58:52,188
'Cause I'm not like that!

1233
00:58:52,226 --> 00:58:54,251
You're my daughter, Sharon!

1234
00:58:54,295 --> 00:58:57,925
And, feck it all,
you're my daughter...

1235
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,901
and as long as you
live in this house...

1236
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:02,129
I won't let bollixes
say things about you!

1237
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:04,163
- Maybe I should leave then.
- No, Sharon, no.

1238
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,434
Maybe I will
if you're going to keep...

1239
00:59:05,474 --> 00:59:06,703
getting into fights
all the time!

1240
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:09,940
I won't, Sharon. Honest!
It was just the once!

1241
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:13,712
I... I won't listen
to them anymore.

1242
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:16,948
Only a shower of shites!

1243
00:59:16,989 --> 00:59:20,389
Well... look,
I know you mean well.

1244
00:59:20,425 --> 00:59:21,585
I know, Sharon.

1245
00:59:21,626 --> 00:59:23,093
But I can fight
me own fights on me own!

1246
00:59:23,128 --> 00:59:24,561
No better girl.

1247
00:59:24,597 --> 00:59:26,791
Anyway, they've nothing
to jeer me about.

1248
00:59:26,832 --> 00:59:29,460
You're right, Sharon!
Of course!

1249
00:59:33,674 --> 00:59:35,334
- It's a terrible shock.
- What?

1250
00:59:35,375 --> 00:59:36,866
Being married
for twenty-five years...

1251
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:39,309
and suddenly discovering
your husband's a prick.

1252
00:59:39,346 --> 00:59:41,074
What?!

1253
00:59:45,386 --> 00:59:46,911
You'd be a long time waiting...

1254
00:59:46,955 --> 00:59:50,322
before you'd get a bit
of gratitude in this house!

1255
00:59:50,358 --> 00:59:51,689
Huh. Ohh!

1256
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:44,008
No!

1257
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:45,949
She's havin' the baby!

1258
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,480
I'm not.

1259
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,114
Look, keep back, you.
Give her space.

1260
01:00:50,156 --> 01:00:51,748
I have to go to the toilet!

1261
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:53,816
Is that all? Jesus!

1262
01:01:01,235 --> 01:01:03,169
The kettle's boiled in here.

1263
01:01:25,528 --> 01:01:26,826
You're not goin'out
like that.

1264
01:01:26,864 --> 01:01:28,331
Oh, Da, please!

1265
01:01:28,364 --> 01:01:32,095
You're not goin'out
dressed like that!

1266
01:01:32,136 --> 01:01:33,603
You can forget about it.

1267
01:01:33,637 --> 01:01:35,036
What's wrong with it?

1268
01:01:35,072 --> 01:01:37,064
Every bowsie in Barrytown
will be sniff in' after ya.

1269
01:01:37,108 --> 01:01:38,267
That's what's wrong with it.

1270
01:01:38,308 --> 01:01:39,468
Stop that, Dessie.

1271
01:01:39,511 --> 01:01:41,809
That the two groups
are closely related.

1272
01:01:41,846 --> 01:01:43,575
Well, we already have one...

1273
01:01:43,614 --> 01:01:45,015
One what?

1274
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:48,247
Go upstairs,
put a proper skirt on...

1275
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:49,583
and then you can go out.

1276
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:51,146
Go on, love.

1277
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:53,487
Yous haven't a clue.

1278
01:01:53,526 --> 01:01:55,221
It's got a segmented body...

1279
01:01:57,397 --> 01:02:00,525
- Hey, where you goin'?
- To Jackie's!

1280
01:02:03,037 --> 01:02:05,368
...a fist with a hook on it.

1281
01:02:05,405 --> 01:02:08,863
That is a sign
that this is a fully mature...

1282
01:02:08,909 --> 01:02:12,106
What? What?!

1283
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:14,637
Ah, go on.
Go on and play with your pals.

1284
01:02:14,681 --> 01:02:17,480
I can't go to the pub.

1285
01:02:17,518 --> 01:02:18,918
You're dead right.

1286
01:02:18,954 --> 01:02:20,580
I wouldn't take that
from my da.

1287
01:02:20,621 --> 01:02:21,783
Is that all right then?

1288
01:02:21,824 --> 01:02:24,292
Yeah, it is, and come here.

1289
01:02:24,326 --> 01:02:26,590
If nothing happens, and he's
still actin' the prick...

1290
01:02:26,628 --> 01:02:28,823
we go ahead and do it. OK?

1291
01:02:28,864 --> 01:02:30,058
Are you serious?

1292
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,761
Yeah. Why not?

1293
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,827
Anything to get away
from these bleedin' things.

1294
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:35,770
They freak me out, they do.

1295
01:02:35,805 --> 01:02:38,603
I can never stay in here
on me own.

1296
01:02:38,641 --> 01:02:41,805
All these little cement men
starin' at me.

1297
01:02:43,048 --> 01:02:44,207
There, Sharon.

1298
01:02:44,248 --> 01:02:46,715
Mr. Burgess, what?

1299
01:03:02,467 --> 01:03:07,302
I'm amazed I let it slip away

1300
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:11,140
I, I am crazed

1301
01:03:11,177 --> 01:03:13,007
It's runnin'through my...

1302
01:03:13,045 --> 01:03:14,477
Hi.

1303
01:03:15,748 --> 01:03:17,944
Pain that runs...

1304
01:03:17,984 --> 01:03:20,350
- I said, "Hi, Daddy."
- I heard you.

1305
01:03:20,387 --> 01:03:24,824
Has to fall

1306
01:03:24,857 --> 01:03:26,758
You're in me way. Lookit.

1307
01:03:29,596 --> 01:03:31,793
I was watchin' that!

1308
01:03:37,873 --> 01:03:39,806
Why won't you
talk to me anymore?

1309
01:03:39,842 --> 01:03:41,104
I do talk to ya.

1310
01:03:41,143 --> 01:03:43,111
- You don't.
- Yes, I do.

1311
01:03:43,144 --> 01:03:44,737
I said hello to you yesterday.

1312
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,713
Not properly.

1313
01:03:46,749 --> 01:03:49,741
I'll tell you the last time
you talked to me properly.

1314
01:03:49,785 --> 01:03:53,244
The night before you were hit
in the nose.

1315
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:55,588
Why are you treating me
like shite, Daddy?

1316
01:03:55,626 --> 01:03:57,060
I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

1317
01:03:57,094 --> 01:03:58,891
You do know.

1318
01:03:58,929 --> 01:04:00,865
Will I tell ya?

1319
01:04:00,898 --> 01:04:02,230
'Cause I've shamed the family.

1320
01:04:02,267 --> 01:04:04,428
- No!
- Don't bother denying it.

1321
01:04:04,468 --> 01:04:06,096
It's true.

1322
01:04:06,138 --> 01:04:08,300
I've been stupid and selfish.

1323
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:09,773
I should've known.

1324
01:04:11,377 --> 01:04:13,173
And I know you still think
that Mr. Burgess is...

1325
01:04:13,213 --> 01:04:16,205
I don't think
Mr. Burgess is anything.

1326
01:04:16,249 --> 01:04:19,343
You do.
Even though you hide it well.

1327
01:04:20,888 --> 01:04:25,221
Sorry, Daddy.
You were great.

1328
01:04:27,495 --> 01:04:30,396
So, I think it'd be best
if I leave, for everyone.

1329
01:04:30,432 --> 01:04:32,730
You can get back to normal.

1330
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:34,428
- Leave?
- Yeah.

1331
01:04:34,469 --> 01:04:36,699
Me and Jackie
are goin' to get a flat.

1332
01:04:36,738 --> 01:04:38,638
You're not goin'.

1333
01:04:38,673 --> 01:04:42,269
I am. I want to.

1334
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:43,710
It's for the best.

1335
01:04:46,148 --> 01:04:47,705
Night, night.

1336
01:04:47,749 --> 01:04:49,718
Ah, Sharon, no.

1337
01:04:55,659 --> 01:04:57,560
She won't go.

1338
01:04:57,594 --> 01:04:59,823
I'll talk to her
in the mornin'.

1339
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,895
You were great, Da.

1340
01:05:05,803 --> 01:05:08,168
She apologized.

1341
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:13,570
Pub.

1342
01:05:13,611 --> 01:05:16,444
What's hard and hairy
on the outside?

1343
01:05:23,122 --> 01:05:24,281
It's wet...

1344
01:05:27,325 --> 01:05:28,793
And soft on the inside.

1345
01:05:28,827 --> 01:05:30,818
Ha ha ha!

1346
01:05:30,864 --> 01:05:32,729
Jesus.

1347
01:05:32,765 --> 01:05:35,256
It begins with a "C."

1348
01:05:35,301 --> 01:05:37,862
It ends with a "T."

1349
01:05:37,904 --> 01:05:39,531
And it has a "U"
and an "N" in it.

1350
01:05:43,311 --> 01:05:45,005
A cu-cu-cu-coconut.

1351
01:05:45,046 --> 01:05:46,206
Ha!

1352
01:05:46,247 --> 01:05:49,978
A coconut!

1353
01:05:50,018 --> 01:05:52,282
But, Sharon, you can't go.
I won't let you.

1354
01:05:52,321 --> 01:05:53,481
Try bleedin' stoppin' me.

1355
01:05:53,521 --> 01:05:54,852
Now, there's no need for that.

1356
01:05:54,889 --> 01:05:57,484
We want you
to stay here with us...

1357
01:05:57,526 --> 01:06:00,586
a- and have it...
the... the baby... with us.

1358
01:06:00,629 --> 01:06:01,789
- Don't we, Kay?
- Yeah.

1359
01:06:01,831 --> 01:06:02,991
- I'm goin'.
- When?

1360
01:06:03,031 --> 01:06:04,260
- After dinner.
- Today?

1361
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:05,460
Yeah.

1362
01:06:05,501 --> 01:06:06,660
Oh, for Christ's sake, Sharon.

1363
01:06:08,137 --> 01:06:11,129
God. Oh.

1364
01:06:11,174 --> 01:06:14,144
I hope you enjoyed gettin'
yourself into that state.

1365
01:06:14,177 --> 01:06:15,338
Did you?

1366
01:06:15,379 --> 01:06:17,006
It's for the best.
I'm goin'.

1367
01:06:17,047 --> 01:06:20,539
Huh? Look, this is your home.

1368
01:06:20,584 --> 01:06:24,351
You should stay.
Stay with your family.

1369
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:28,491
Maybe now. But look it.

1370
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:30,084
It's gonna keep reminding you
of Mr. Burgess.

1371
01:06:30,129 --> 01:06:31,459
Oh, no.

1372
01:06:31,496 --> 01:06:33,361
No, it will.
Even though it wasn't him.

1373
01:06:33,399 --> 01:06:36,095
I'll go upstairs and pack.

1374
01:06:36,135 --> 01:06:39,571
What? Oh.

1375
01:06:57,025 --> 01:06:59,892
She's not goin', Kay.

1376
01:06:59,927 --> 01:07:02,556
She's not!

1377
01:07:02,598 --> 01:07:04,566
And you, gobshite!

1378
01:07:04,599 --> 01:07:06,625
You wash them dishes
when you're finished!

1379
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:11,230
Now get off him, will ya?

1380
01:07:25,956 --> 01:07:28,821
- You on your own?
- Yep.

1381
01:07:28,858 --> 01:07:30,018
Where's the girls?

1382
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:32,290
I don't know. Out.

1383
01:07:32,328 --> 01:07:33,887
Fair play to them.

1384
01:07:35,432 --> 01:07:37,525
- Don't go, Sharon.
- I have to.

1385
01:07:37,568 --> 01:07:39,297
You don't have to.

1386
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:49,112
Sorry. Cryin'.

1387
01:07:49,147 --> 01:07:51,412
I don't know what to say.

1388
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:54,614
Sorry, Sharon.

1389
01:07:54,654 --> 01:07:56,644
I haven't cried
since I was a kid.

1390
01:07:56,688 --> 01:07:58,179
You cried during the World Cup.

1391
01:07:58,224 --> 01:08:00,921
Sober, Sharon, sober.

1392
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:04,021
Drunk doesn't count.

1393
01:08:04,063 --> 01:08:06,293
We all do stupid things
when we're drunk, don't we?

1394
01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:07,664
I know.

1395
01:08:07,701 --> 01:08:12,138
Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.

1396
01:08:12,172 --> 01:08:13,469
I know, Da.

1397
01:08:13,508 --> 01:08:17,137
I'm sorry. Anyway, look.

1398
01:08:17,177 --> 01:08:19,578
I've been a right bollix...

1399
01:08:19,614 --> 01:08:22,811
'cause I was feelin'
hard done by.

1400
01:08:22,851 --> 01:08:26,514
It's my fault.
Please don't go, Sharon.

1401
01:08:26,555 --> 01:08:27,818
I'll only keep
remindin' you of...

1402
01:08:27,857 --> 01:08:30,222
Look, I'm sorry
to interrupt you.

1403
01:08:30,259 --> 01:08:32,853
This is really hard
for me to say.

1404
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:37,762
I wanted you to feel bad...

1405
01:08:37,802 --> 01:08:39,997
'cause I was feelin' sorry
for meself.

1406
01:08:40,038 --> 01:08:41,902
I can't look at you
when I'm sayin' this.

1407
01:08:47,612 --> 01:08:49,843
Please, don't go, Sharon.

1408
01:08:49,882 --> 01:08:52,510
We need you here.

1409
01:08:52,552 --> 01:08:55,646
The girls!

1410
01:09:08,068 --> 01:09:10,092
What about the baby?

1411
01:09:13,374 --> 01:09:16,070
I feel like a bleedin' eejit.

1412
01:09:18,312 --> 01:09:20,679
I love you, Sharon.

1413
01:09:20,715 --> 01:09:23,707
And the baby, well,
it'll be yours...

1414
01:09:23,752 --> 01:09:27,188
so I'll love it the same.

1415
01:09:27,223 --> 01:09:29,521
What if it looks
like Mr. Burgess?

1416
01:09:29,559 --> 01:09:31,892
I don't care
what it looks like.

1417
01:09:31,929 --> 01:09:33,226
I couldn't give a shite.

1418
01:09:33,262 --> 01:09:34,627
That's easy to say now.

1419
01:09:34,664 --> 01:09:36,257
I'm not just
saying that, Sharon.

1420
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:38,291
I swear I'm not.

1421
01:09:38,335 --> 01:09:42,237
If it looked like Burgess's
arse, I'd still love it.

1422
01:09:43,674 --> 01:09:46,269
On the Bible.

1423
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:50,805
What if it's a girl
and it looks like Mr. Burgess?

1424
01:09:52,082 --> 01:09:53,845
Oh, feck it.

1425
01:09:53,885 --> 01:09:57,184
Then we'll have to smother it
and leave it on his step, what?

1426
01:09:57,222 --> 01:09:58,416
Daddy.

1427
01:09:58,455 --> 01:10:00,447
I'm only messin'.

1428
01:10:00,491 --> 01:10:01,924
She'll be lovely.

1429
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,428
She better be.

1430
01:10:04,462 --> 01:10:06,521
We're a good-lookin' family.

1431
01:10:12,705 --> 01:10:17,074
Anyway, it won't
look like Burgess...

1432
01:10:17,109 --> 01:10:19,442
'cause he isn't the da, right?

1433
01:10:19,478 --> 01:10:20,672
Yeah.

1434
01:10:24,684 --> 01:10:26,015
Unless your Spanish sailor...

1435
01:10:26,052 --> 01:10:27,714
looks a bit like him.
Does he?

1436
01:10:29,055 --> 01:10:31,149
Just a little bit.

1437
01:10:33,427 --> 01:10:35,327
Oh, well.

1438
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:40,168
Because I love you

1439
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:43,968
In my own peculiar way

1440
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:45,269
Once more.

1441
01:10:45,308 --> 01:10:49,210
Because I love you

1442
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:53,113
In my own peculiar way

1443
01:10:53,149 --> 01:10:54,741
Here, look, get yourselves
some 7-Ups...

1444
01:10:54,784 --> 01:10:56,274
and some of that stuff
that Tina Turner drinks.

1445
01:10:56,319 --> 01:10:57,480
- What is it?
- Pepsi.

1446
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,351
- Go on.
- What about me?

1447
01:10:59,389 --> 01:11:01,085
A Toblerone?
A Toblerone for your mommy.

1448
01:11:01,125 --> 01:11:03,093
- Take that. Go on.
- Can I have a flake?

1449
01:11:03,126 --> 01:11:04,287
Yeah, go on.

1450
01:11:04,329 --> 01:11:05,556
Hang on! Get me something
with marshmallows in it!

1451
01:11:05,596 --> 01:11:07,792
Feck ya!

1452
01:11:07,831 --> 01:11:09,128
Are you well, Kay?

1453
01:11:09,166 --> 01:11:13,194
- I'm all right.
- Huh? Ha ha ha.

1454
01:11:13,238 --> 01:11:14,399
Ma?

1455
01:11:14,439 --> 01:11:16,203
- What?
- What do you think of Sebastian?

1456
01:11:16,241 --> 01:11:17,766
Lovely.

1457
01:11:17,809 --> 01:11:19,744
River.
Call him River, Sharon.

1458
01:11:19,779 --> 01:11:21,770
What about... Ma?

1459
01:11:21,815 --> 01:11:22,974
What?

1460
01:11:23,015 --> 01:11:24,448
- What about Marcus?
- Lovely.

1461
01:11:24,483 --> 01:11:25,882
Great help you are.

1462
01:11:25,918 --> 01:11:28,080
I think it should be Desmond.

1463
01:11:28,121 --> 01:11:29,587
Come on.
I'll give you a lift, love.

1464
01:11:29,623 --> 01:11:30,782
Keanu.

1465
01:11:30,823 --> 01:11:31,984
No way.

1466
01:11:32,025 --> 01:11:33,185
River, then.

1467
01:11:33,226 --> 01:11:35,524
River Curley?
Get lost, Lisa.

1468
01:11:54,516 --> 01:11:56,313
Ah, it's for the wife.

1469
01:12:10,566 --> 01:12:13,035
Stick that in.
In the socket there.

1470
01:12:13,068 --> 01:12:15,299
- Which one?
- The bottom one.

1471
01:12:15,338 --> 01:12:17,705
- There?
- Yeah, go on.

1472
01:12:17,741 --> 01:12:18,902
- Aah!
- Jeez!

1473
01:12:20,144 --> 01:12:22,635
What in the name
of Jesus was that?

1474
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:23,942
What happened?

1475
01:12:23,981 --> 01:12:25,608
She stuck the nail
in the socket.

1476
01:12:25,648 --> 01:12:27,584
Again?
What'd you do that for?

1477
01:12:27,618 --> 01:12:28,812
'Cause it fit.

1478
01:12:28,853 --> 01:12:30,048
We'll have
to have her looked at.

1479
01:12:30,087 --> 01:12:31,577
I'll get me jacket.

1480
01:12:31,622 --> 01:12:33,818
I can't wait to see
the shaggin'electric bill.

1481
01:12:33,859 --> 01:12:35,019
Are you readin' this?

1482
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:36,460
What?

1483
01:12:37,496 --> 01:12:38,657
Uh, yeah.

1484
01:12:38,697 --> 01:12:39,857
What are you readin' it for?

1485
01:12:39,899 --> 01:12:41,890
Ha. Curiosity, you know?

1486
01:12:41,934 --> 01:12:45,426
Kimberley's after
electrocutin' herself again.

1487
01:12:47,541 --> 01:12:50,270
Do you get cramps, Sharon?

1488
01:12:51,678 --> 01:12:52,769
No.

1489
01:12:52,812 --> 01:12:56,807
No? Good. I'd say
they'd be a killer, what?

1490
01:12:56,851 --> 01:12:58,317
We'll have to keep
our fingers crossed.

1491
01:12:58,352 --> 01:12:59,718
Nothin'else?

1492
01:12:59,754 --> 01:13:01,277
- Wrong?
- Yeah.

1493
01:13:01,321 --> 01:13:02,880
- No.
- Good.

1494
01:13:02,924 --> 01:13:04,585
I'll see you. All right?

1495
01:13:04,626 --> 01:13:05,786
Where are yous?

1496
01:13:05,828 --> 01:13:06,987
Here!

1497
01:13:07,028 --> 01:13:08,188
Is it safe to touch her?

1498
01:13:08,229 --> 01:13:09,719
Come on. Get out.

1499
01:13:16,238 --> 01:13:18,731
I was lookin'
at another chapter there...

1500
01:13:18,776 --> 01:13:21,404
about, you know,
doin' the business.

1501
01:13:21,446 --> 01:13:22,743
Sex?

1502
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:26,477
Yeah. Jesus.

1503
01:13:26,516 --> 01:13:29,281
I don't know. Ha.

1504
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,289
It's very complicated,
isn't it?

1505
01:13:31,322 --> 01:13:33,051
I can't say I don't know.

1506
01:13:33,091 --> 01:13:36,960
What? Oh, yeah. Ha ha ha.

1507
01:13:36,995 --> 01:13:39,487
I'd say Georgie Burgess...

1508
01:13:39,532 --> 01:13:41,396
was a dab hand
at the old foreplay, what?

1509
01:13:41,433 --> 01:13:43,095
Aw, Daddy.

1510
01:13:43,136 --> 01:13:44,967
Only messin'.

1511
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:48,029
But you know...

1512
01:13:48,074 --> 01:13:51,772
this business, you know...
ridin' and that, you know.

1513
01:13:51,812 --> 01:13:54,576
Jesus, I don't know, Sharon.

1514
01:13:54,616 --> 01:13:55,946
I'd better warn Mummy.

1515
01:13:55,983 --> 01:13:58,111
What?

1516
01:13:58,153 --> 01:14:01,884
Oh, very good.
Very good, yeah.

1517
01:14:13,769 --> 01:14:15,463
Oh, come on!

1518
01:14:15,504 --> 01:14:18,668
I don't want to miss
the "Antiques Roadshow."

1519
01:14:18,707 --> 01:14:21,404
Your fingernail! Dessie!

1520
01:14:21,444 --> 01:14:23,345
Sorry.

1521
01:14:25,649 --> 01:14:27,240
How was that?

1522
01:14:32,956 --> 01:14:35,049
I love you, Kay.

1523
01:14:35,092 --> 01:14:39,051
Jesus!
Get out and brush your teeth.

1524
01:14:39,097 --> 01:14:42,589
No. Hang on.
Do that again.

1525
01:14:42,634 --> 01:14:45,933
What? That?

1526
01:14:47,172 --> 01:14:48,832
Yeah.

1527
01:14:55,515 --> 01:14:57,948
There?

1528
01:14:57,983 --> 01:15:00,509
Do you like that, Kay?

1529
01:15:00,553 --> 01:15:03,022
It's all right.

1530
01:15:06,792 --> 01:15:08,420
Where did you learn to do that?

1531
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:09,723
- Let go!
- Where?

1532
01:15:09,763 --> 01:15:12,927
Let... in a book!
Will you let go?

1533
01:15:39,495 --> 01:15:43,124
I will
always remember you, Sharon.

1534
01:15:49,739 --> 01:15:51,572
Jesus!

1535
01:15:51,609 --> 01:15:54,009
What's wrong?
Is it comin'?

1536
01:15:54,045 --> 01:15:56,274
No. No, I'm sorry.

1537
01:15:56,313 --> 01:15:59,477
I just fell asleep
without knowin'. Sorry.

1538
01:15:59,516 --> 01:16:01,041
It's all right.

1539
01:16:01,087 --> 01:16:04,078
You can't be too careful
about these things.

1540
01:16:04,122 --> 01:16:06,421
Oh, we wouldn't want
you burstin' your waters...

1541
01:16:06,459 --> 01:16:07,619
all over our furniture.

1542
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:09,150
Sure we wouldn't, Dessie dear.

1543
01:16:09,195 --> 01:16:11,186
They are new covers.

1544
01:16:12,732 --> 01:16:13,994
Sorry, Sharon.

1545
01:16:15,268 --> 01:16:18,795
That's a terrible thing
for Kay to say. Terrible!

1546
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,465
Ah, stop it.
She was only jokin'.

1547
01:16:20,507 --> 01:16:22,270
Ah, there's jokin' and jokin'...

1548
01:16:22,309 --> 01:16:26,268
but that's the dirtiest,
foulest thing to...

1549
01:16:26,313 --> 01:16:28,305
Daddy!

1550
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:33,787
There seems to be only
one person in this house...

1551
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:35,846
takin' this thing seriously,
and that's me.

1552
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:38,451
Excuse me.
I'm the one that's pregnant.

1553
01:16:38,494 --> 01:16:40,792
You're gettin' snotty now
because of your hormones.

1554
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:41,989
I'll talk to you later.

1555
01:16:42,031 --> 01:16:43,362
There's nothin' wrong
with my hormones.

1556
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,833
I didn't say there was
anything wrong with 'em.

1557
01:16:44,867 --> 01:16:47,234
There's nothin' wrong
with 'em as such.

1558
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:49,363
"Wrong" is the wrong word.

1559
01:16:49,406 --> 01:16:52,704
Imbalance is the term I'd use.

1560
01:16:52,742 --> 01:16:55,608
The result is snottiness
and depression.

1561
01:16:55,645 --> 01:16:57,943
Thank you, Professor Curley.

1562
01:17:01,686 --> 01:17:04,382
When your mummy was...

1563
01:17:04,422 --> 01:17:07,016
Times have changed.
Do you know that?

1564
01:17:07,058 --> 01:17:11,586
When your mummy was havin'
Craig, I was in work.

1565
01:17:11,629 --> 01:17:14,359
When she was havin' you,
I was at me mother's.

1566
01:17:14,398 --> 01:17:17,697
When she had Sonny,
I was in work as well.

1567
01:17:17,736 --> 01:17:21,603
Lisa... don't know where I was.

1568
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:25,975
For Darren, I was
in the pub with the lads.

1569
01:17:26,012 --> 01:17:27,740
You have a great memory.

1570
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:32,615
Nowadays, the husbands are
there with the wives, you know?

1571
01:17:32,653 --> 01:17:35,247
I think that's much better.

1572
01:17:35,289 --> 01:17:38,224
You know,
'cause they're able to...

1573
01:17:38,258 --> 01:17:41,194
hold their hands
and help them...

1574
01:17:41,228 --> 01:17:45,996
and encourage them
and see their child being born.

1575
01:17:48,002 --> 01:17:50,493
Sharon, I'd...

1576
01:17:50,538 --> 01:17:54,872
Now, this is only if you want.

1577
01:17:54,909 --> 01:17:59,406
I wouldn't mind staying
with ya when you're havin' him.

1578
01:17:59,449 --> 01:18:01,279
Ah, no.

1579
01:18:04,187 --> 01:18:05,519
OK.

1580
01:18:07,858 --> 01:18:10,224
You'll take it easy, Sharon,
now won't you?

1581
01:18:10,261 --> 01:18:12,786
Yeah, Daddy.

1582
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:14,162
Whoo!

1583
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,368
I'm pissed.

1584
01:18:23,409 --> 01:18:24,774
So am I.

1585
01:18:24,810 --> 01:18:26,108
Oh, I shouldn't be doin' this.

1586
01:18:26,145 --> 01:18:29,115
- What?
- Drinkin'! Ha ha ha!

1587
01:18:29,148 --> 01:18:30,309
Don't be thick, Sharon.

1588
01:18:30,351 --> 01:18:31,782
You need to get pissed
now and again.

1589
01:18:31,818 --> 01:18:35,185
There's no harm in it.

1590
01:18:35,221 --> 01:18:37,485
I'm gonna be sick.

1591
01:18:37,525 --> 01:18:39,925
Oh, Jesus. Come on.

1592
01:18:40,927 --> 01:18:42,759
No, I won't make it!

1593
01:18:53,542 --> 01:18:55,033
It'll hold.

1594
01:18:55,076 --> 01:18:58,046
I'll bring it out
in a minute and empty it.

1595
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:01,538
Ha ha ha!

1596
01:19:01,584 --> 01:19:03,177
I'm goin' home.

1597
01:19:03,219 --> 01:19:05,278
Jesus. Is it startin'?

1598
01:19:05,322 --> 01:19:08,951
Yeah. No.
I just think...

1599
01:19:08,992 --> 01:19:12,053
- I want to go home.
- Come on.

1600
01:19:12,095 --> 01:19:14,358
Get out of me way,
you dopey gee-bag.

1601
01:19:14,397 --> 01:19:16,456
Come on, Sharon.

1602
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,525
Excuse me.

1603
01:19:18,569 --> 01:19:20,559
Stop forcing me

1604
01:19:20,603 --> 01:19:22,765
We're comin' through!

1605
01:19:22,806 --> 01:19:24,899
It's my life

1606
01:19:27,077 --> 01:19:29,875
Jesus, sorry.
It'll wash off!

1607
01:19:31,816 --> 01:19:35,183
Here! Come back here, you!

1608
01:19:35,221 --> 01:19:37,951
He saw me, the prick.
The next one.

1609
01:19:37,989 --> 01:19:40,220
Yeah.

1610
01:19:41,227 --> 01:19:44,890
Here! Here! Look at...

1611
01:19:46,533 --> 01:19:48,591
I'm wringing, look it!

1612
01:19:55,710 --> 01:19:57,472
Get your own bleedin' taxi, you.

1613
01:19:57,510 --> 01:19:59,342
Is anything happening yet?

1614
01:19:59,379 --> 01:20:01,109
No. I'm sorry, Jackie.

1615
01:20:01,148 --> 01:20:02,945
Ah, feck off, will ya?

1616
01:20:04,886 --> 01:20:07,981
Hey! Taxi!

1617
01:20:08,023 --> 01:20:10,617
Oh, finally.

1618
01:20:12,294 --> 01:20:14,228
- Sorry.
- Shut up. Hang on.

1619
01:20:14,264 --> 01:20:15,662
Have you the money
to pay for this?

1620
01:20:18,167 --> 01:20:21,000
Oh, Jesus! Oh, fuck.

1621
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:31,303
Shite!

1622
01:20:31,347 --> 01:20:33,748
Come on, Darren!

1623
01:20:33,784 --> 01:20:37,185
Stupid bleedin' thing.

1624
01:20:37,221 --> 01:20:39,747
Come on!
Seven seconds down, lads!

1625
01:20:39,790 --> 01:20:43,248
Seven seconds! Nine seconds
down, lads. Come on!

1626
01:20:43,294 --> 01:20:45,695
Nine seconds!
Come on, give it a push!

1627
01:20:45,730 --> 01:20:48,028
One last go!

1628
01:20:48,067 --> 01:20:49,533
Come on, come on, paddy last!

1629
01:20:49,567 --> 01:20:51,536
Give it a lash!

1630
01:20:51,569 --> 01:20:55,165
Poor little bastard.

1631
01:20:55,207 --> 01:20:57,472
He'll saw the bollocks
off himself.

1632
01:21:06,687 --> 01:21:09,485
Hey, Burgess! Burgess!

1633
01:21:11,192 --> 01:21:12,750
You know what I'd like
to do with these...

1634
01:21:12,794 --> 01:21:14,888
don't you, Burgess, heh?

1635
01:21:14,929 --> 01:21:16,624
Snip snip.

1636
01:21:22,404 --> 01:21:25,862
Da, Da! Sharon thinks
she's havin' the baby.

1637
01:21:25,908 --> 01:21:27,341
She told me to tell you...

1638
01:21:27,377 --> 01:21:29,971
that her contraptions
have started.

1639
01:21:30,013 --> 01:21:34,312
Oh, Jesus.
Red alert! Red alert!

1640
01:21:39,622 --> 01:21:41,111
Come on, move it, will yous?

1641
01:21:41,156 --> 01:21:43,216
Get down the stairs, will ya?
Let's make a bit of room!

1642
01:21:43,259 --> 01:21:44,419
Lisa!

1643
01:21:49,065 --> 01:21:51,432
Is she gonna have a baby?

1644
01:21:51,469 --> 01:21:52,868
You get out of here,
you gobshite.

1645
01:21:52,903 --> 01:21:54,131
Make room there!

1646
01:21:54,172 --> 01:21:55,638
Lisa, go up and get her bag
for her, will ya?

1647
01:21:55,673 --> 01:21:57,334
Oh, and my toothbrush, Lisa.

1648
01:21:57,376 --> 01:21:59,173
Mind the step now, Sharon.
There you go.

1649
01:21:59,210 --> 01:22:02,009
The old hedge did need
a cuttin', didn't it? What?

1650
01:22:02,047 --> 01:22:05,107
Whoo-hoo.
So far, so good, huh?

1651
01:22:05,150 --> 01:22:06,310
Da, can I come with yous?

1652
01:22:06,352 --> 01:22:07,512
No, you can't.

1653
01:22:07,552 --> 01:22:10,522
Just relax.
You're in good hands, huh?

1654
01:22:10,555 --> 01:22:12,854
Ha ha ha!
There you go now.

1655
01:22:12,892 --> 01:22:14,620
Get in there now.
Mind your head.

1656
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:16,355
Do you want to take
a few sandwiches?

1657
01:22:16,396 --> 01:22:18,888
Sandwiches?

1658
01:22:18,932 --> 01:22:21,297
It's a hospital we're goin' to,
not the pine forest.

1659
01:22:21,336 --> 01:22:22,528
Give it to her over that side.

1660
01:22:22,569 --> 01:22:23,763
Go on. Over there.

1661
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:28,908
Does it really
hurt you, Sharon? Does it?

1662
01:22:28,942 --> 01:22:31,639
- Go away, you!
- You're dead.

1663
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:32,873
Bye-bye, love.

1664
01:22:32,913 --> 01:22:35,746
Everything'll
be all right. Wait and see.

1665
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:37,718
Right.

1666
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:40,580
Give us a ring as soon
as you've any news, will ya?

1667
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:42,455
I'll think about it.

1668
01:22:57,308 --> 01:23:00,675
Rollin', rollin', rollin'

1669
01:23:00,711 --> 01:23:03,704
Keep them doggies rollin'

1670
01:23:03,749 --> 01:23:07,379
Keep them doggies rollin',
Rawhide

1671
01:23:07,419 --> 01:23:08,648
Dad.

1672
01:23:08,687 --> 01:23:11,213
- Yes, love?
- Shut up.

1673
01:23:11,257 --> 01:23:12,780
OK.

1674
01:23:16,262 --> 01:23:18,196
Turn green, you bastards!

1675
01:23:18,232 --> 01:23:20,291
Can't expect them all
to be green, I suppose, what?

1676
01:23:20,334 --> 01:23:22,962
Good girl. It's only
the old cervix dilating.

1677
01:23:23,003 --> 01:23:24,937
It could happen to a bishop.

1678
01:23:24,972 --> 01:23:26,701
Here, look, Sharon.
You take this.

1679
01:23:26,741 --> 01:23:28,401
You can time the contractions.

1680
01:23:28,441 --> 01:23:30,467
That way we'll be able to tell
'em when we get there. What?

1681
01:23:30,511 --> 01:23:32,377
They'll be impressed with that.
Green!

1682
01:23:34,683 --> 01:23:36,116
Oh, my God. Sit back.

1683
01:23:36,151 --> 01:23:37,676
Take deep breaths.
Good girl.

1684
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:39,153
Good deep breaths.
That's what I always do.

1685
01:23:39,187 --> 01:23:40,620
What? Ha ha ha!

1686
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:46,828
We're nearly there,
nearly there.

1687
01:23:46,864 --> 01:23:51,197
Is this the way to Amarillo

1688
01:23:51,235 --> 01:23:54,863
I've been weeping
like a willow

1689
01:23:54,903 --> 01:23:56,064
Daddy.

1690
01:23:56,106 --> 01:23:57,834
Oh, sorry.

1691
01:23:59,276 --> 01:24:01,641
Get out of me way,
you dozy bollix!

1692
01:24:01,677 --> 01:24:03,077
Look at the head on him, what?

1693
01:24:03,113 --> 01:24:04,808
Up for the day, I tell ya.

1694
01:24:04,847 --> 01:24:06,974
Here we are.
We're there!

1695
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:11,249
Jesus.

1696
01:24:13,858 --> 01:24:15,382
Come on, love.
You'll be all right.

1697
01:24:15,426 --> 01:24:17,395
You all right?
I've got it.

1698
01:24:17,428 --> 01:24:19,623
I have it, I have it. Go.

1699
01:24:40,221 --> 01:24:42,849
It's to speed up the dilation,
that's all.

1700
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:44,755
When you see a drip
on the telly...

1701
01:24:44,791 --> 01:24:47,420
you know someone's
in big trouble, but not here.

1702
01:24:50,131 --> 01:24:51,690
It'll make your fanny relax.

1703
01:24:51,733 --> 01:24:53,199
Ha ha ha!

1704
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:15,986
Is this your first?

1705
01:25:16,026 --> 01:25:19,223
Yeah. Oh, no, no.

1706
01:25:19,264 --> 01:25:22,097
It's, uh,
it's me first grandchild.

1707
01:25:23,767 --> 01:25:25,827
Is it your first?

1708
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:27,633
No, me third.

1709
01:25:32,644 --> 01:25:34,840
Have you read this?

1710
01:25:49,530 --> 01:25:50,860
How long more?

1711
01:25:50,897 --> 01:25:53,957
Not too long now, love.
We're nearly there.

1712
01:25:54,001 --> 01:25:56,698
I can see
the baby's head, Sharon.

1713
01:25:56,737 --> 01:25:58,433
Is it big?

1714
01:25:58,474 --> 01:26:00,202
Ha ha ha!

1715
01:26:00,241 --> 01:26:02,505
Don't push, love.
It's too early.

1716
01:26:02,544 --> 01:26:05,240
Don't push. Breathe.

1717
01:26:11,054 --> 01:26:12,645
Can you feel that?

1718
01:26:12,689 --> 01:26:14,213
What?

1719
01:26:14,257 --> 01:26:15,985
Bingo. Hmm.

1720
01:26:16,024 --> 01:26:17,322
Thunderbirds are go.

1721
01:26:34,078 --> 01:26:35,510
You come out!

1722
01:26:35,546 --> 01:26:38,539
Good.

1723
01:26:39,849 --> 01:26:41,750
Right, Sharon, once more.

1724
01:26:41,787 --> 01:26:44,381
Push! Push!

1725
01:26:44,423 --> 01:26:46,788
That's it! Good! Push.

1726
01:26:46,824 --> 01:26:50,158
You're doin'great. Push!

1727
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:57,326
What stopped beeping?

1728
01:26:57,370 --> 01:27:00,430
Get Dr. Cook.

1729
01:27:00,473 --> 01:27:02,134
I don't know, Kay.
I don't know.

1730
01:27:02,175 --> 01:27:05,543
They won't tell me.
The nurses.

1731
01:27:05,579 --> 01:27:08,047
Oh, Jesus, Kay.
She went in there ages ago...

1732
01:27:08,081 --> 01:27:10,710
and some of the other ones
that went in after her...

1733
01:27:11,819 --> 01:27:16,484
Huh? Yeah, right.
Yeah, right.

1734
01:27:23,667 --> 01:27:25,497
What? All right.

1735
01:27:25,535 --> 01:27:29,164
I'll get back to you
if I hear anything. See ya.

1736
01:27:29,205 --> 01:27:30,833
Oh.

1737
01:27:33,110 --> 01:27:35,374
Boy or a girl, Sharon?

1738
01:27:35,412 --> 01:27:39,281
I don't care.
Don't mind. Just safe.

1739
01:27:39,317 --> 01:27:40,978
Will there be marks
on his head?

1740
01:27:41,018 --> 01:27:42,986
Only for a few days.

1741
01:27:43,021 --> 01:27:44,783
Fiver says it's a girl.

1742
01:27:47,359 --> 01:27:49,657
Just one big push, Sharon.

1743
01:27:51,331 --> 01:27:53,127
Good girl. Push!

1744
01:27:54,901 --> 01:27:56,197
That's it.

1745
01:28:26,569 --> 01:28:28,696
Look, Sharon.

1746
01:28:52,896 --> 01:28:54,329
Ha ha ha!

1747
01:28:54,364 --> 01:28:56,060
Yahoo!

1748
01:28:59,504 --> 01:29:02,372
Olי

1749
01:29:03,607 --> 01:29:05,576
Ah, keep it
for your wife, what?

1750
01:29:06,879 --> 01:29:10,508
Whoa!

1751
01:29:10,549 --> 01:29:16,978
Seven pounds, twelve ounces.

1752
01:29:17,023 --> 01:29:18,546
Twelve!

1753
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:21,458
Yeah. Two arms, two legs,
and a head. Right.

1754
01:29:21,495 --> 01:29:24,623
Ha ha ha!
I'm not being sarcastic, love.

1755
01:29:24,664 --> 01:29:26,257
No, I'm too bleedin' happy.

1756
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:27,891
All right.
See you later. Bye.

1757
01:29:32,139 --> 01:29:34,607
Good man.

1758
01:29:42,184 --> 01:29:45,484
Seven pounds, twelve ounces.
Huh?

1759
01:29:45,521 --> 01:29:48,820
Is that a turkey or a baby?

1760
01:29:48,858 --> 01:29:51,554
It's a baby.

1761
01:29:51,594 --> 01:29:53,960
That's a good-sized baby.

1762
01:29:53,998 --> 01:29:56,158
Yeah, it is good,
isn't it, huh?

1763
01:29:56,199 --> 01:29:58,394
Small turkey, though.

1764
01:30:00,804 --> 01:30:04,737
Seven pounds, twelve ounces

1765
01:30:04,775 --> 01:30:08,738
La la la la

1766
01:30:08,780 --> 01:30:12,881
Seven pounds, twelve ounces

1767
01:30:12,918 --> 01:30:16,450
La la la la

1768
01:30:35,943 --> 01:30:39,004
She's a great little sucker,
isn't she?

1769
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:46,820
So just rub her gently
on the back like that.

1770
01:30:46,854 --> 01:30:48,789
And give her the odd pat.

1771
01:30:48,824 --> 01:30:50,553
That should bring the wind...

1772
01:31:32,504 --> 01:31:33,697
Oh, God.

1773
01:31:33,739 --> 01:31:35,468
What's wrong with you, love?

1774
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,471
Jesus, love, are you cryin'?

1775
01:31:42,515 --> 01:31:45,575
No. Laughin'.

1776
01:31:45,618 --> 01:31:48,178
I'm after namin' her Georgina.

1777
01:31:48,221 --> 01:31:50,247
Ha ha ha!

1778
01:31:56,864 --> 01:31:59,663
Hey! Slow down. You hear me?

1779
01:32:00,902 --> 01:32:02,426
Come on.

1780
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:04,462
Which room?

1781
01:32:06,575 --> 01:32:08,236
Here. In there. This is it.

1782
01:32:08,277 --> 01:32:09,869
Here, on the left. Here.

1783
01:32:19,056 --> 01:32:21,651
Oh, Jesus.

1784
01:32:40,879 --> 01:32:44,007
Wise men say

1785
01:32:44,049 --> 01:32:47,713
Only fools rush in

1786
01:32:47,755 --> 01:32:50,622
But I can't help

1787
01:32:50,658 --> 01:32:55,755
Falling in love with you

1788
01:32:55,796 --> 01:32:58,425
Shall I stay

1789
01:32:58,466 --> 01:33:02,426
Would it be a sin

1790
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:05,371
If I can't help

1791
01:33:05,407 --> 01:33:09,275
Falling in love with you

1792
01:33:10,579 --> 01:33:13,980
Like a river flows

1793
01:33:14,016 --> 01:33:17,851
Surely to the sea

1794
01:33:17,888 --> 01:33:21,379
Darling, so it goes

1795
01:33:21,424 --> 01:33:25,417
Some things were meant to be

1796
01:33:25,461 --> 01:33:28,021
Take my hand

1797
01:33:28,064 --> 01:33:32,000
Take my whole life, too

1798
01:33:32,035 --> 01:33:34,970
'Cause I can't help

1799
01:33:35,005 --> 01:33:39,066
Falling in love with you

1800
01:33:54,827 --> 01:33:57,318
Wise men say

1801
01:33:57,362 --> 01:34:01,527
Only fools rush in

1802
01:34:01,568 --> 01:34:04,230
But I can't help

1803
01:34:04,271 --> 01:34:08,072
Falling in love with you

1804
01:34:09,508 --> 01:34:12,478
Shall I stay

1805
01:34:12,512 --> 01:34:15,950
Would it be a sin

1806
01:34:15,983 --> 01:34:19,010
If I can't help

1807
01:34:19,054 --> 01:34:23,388
Falling in love with you

1808
01:34:23,425 --> 01:34:26,299
If I can't help

1809
01:34:26,404 --> 01:34:30,471
Falling in love with you

1810
01:34:31,305 --> 01:35:31,394

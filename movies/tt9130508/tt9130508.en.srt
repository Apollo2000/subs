1
00:00:01,793 --> 00:00:02,878
Hey.

2
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:07,257
You want me to sit here?

3
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,181
Can I smoke?

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,434
Hang on.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

6
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,781
Where do you want me to start?

7
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,190
I'm 23 years old,

8
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:50,569
and I still don't understand what it is
that people do.

9
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,161
It's as if all of this were built
on nothing and...

10
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,831
nothing were holding all this together.

11
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,222
I grew up around here.

12
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,060
Apartments are nice.
Some of them have balconies.

13
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:26,897
And the trees are nice.

14
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,234
I don't understand them either,
but I like 'em.

15
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,531
I think I'd like 'em all.

16
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,743
It'd have to be a pretty fucked-up tree
for me not to like it.

17
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,335
Sometimes I wonder
if life was wasted on me.

18
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,047
It's not that I'm dumb
to the beauty of things.

19
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,049
I take all the beautiful things to heart,

20
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,761
and then they fuck my heart
till I about die from it.

21
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,226
It's just something in me
has always drawn me away...

22
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,438
until there's nothing holding me together.

23
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,611
You know where you're going, right?

24
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,240
Make the first left three times.
You can't go wrong.

25
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:22,369
I'll meet you in the parking lot.
Two or three minutes, give or take.

26
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,338
I'm in a baseball hat.

27
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,217
Red scarf,
white button-down shirt, blue hoodie.

28
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,970
Some jeans, old sneakers.
Nothing out of the ordinary.

29
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,849
The scarf is to cover
the lower half of my face.

30
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,601
Although it's a little late
for it to do any good.

31
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,311
I've been at this a while now.

32
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,733
And it's no secret
what my face looks like.

33
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,404
All right, no alarms! I'm a wanted man!
They'll kill me!

34
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,239
My God. What is happening?

35
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,119
I got a lot of sadness in the face
to make up for,

36
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:07,664
so I gotta act like I'm crazy,
or people will think I'm a pussy.

37
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,499
Hey!

38
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,461
Get on the ground!
Get on the fucking ground now!

39
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,297
The one thing about robbing banks
is you're mostly robbing women,

40
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,548
so the last thing you wanna be is rude.

41
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,343
Ma'am, it's nothing personal.

42
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,386
-That's okay.
-What's your name?

43
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,680
-Vanessa.
-Hey, Vanessa. It's nice to meet you.

44
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:25,766
What's your name?

45
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,852
You're funny, Vanessa.
Now, open your fucking drawer.

46
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:39,238
As I stood there holding a gun,
taking her in...

47
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,865
something overtook me.

48
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,117
Like a kind of sadness.

49
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:49,039
It's... as if I'd always known that this
was how things were supposed to end.

50
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:54,294
But I wasn't made to realize it
until that exact...

51
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,171
moment.

52
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,877
The first time I saw Emily, I was
attending one of the local universities.

53
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,963
The one with the Jesuits.
It was a decent school.

54
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,676
And I don't wanna tell lies,

55
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,388
but I thought, "Man, I'd really
like to fuck this girl."

56
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,776
Called your name, like, ten times.

57
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,905
Sorry. My music was loud.

58
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,990
-Hey.
-I like your sweater.

59
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,950
Thank you. I got it on Coventry.

60
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,036
It's an old, sad bastard sweater.

61
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,789
You're in my English class.

62
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,252
I know. Class sucks though, right?

63
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,381
Yeah. But you always go.

64
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:22,549
Yes, I do.

65
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,181
I guess I'll see you around.

66
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,728
Hey, where are you from?

67
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,358
Elba, New York.

68
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:40,526
What's that like?

69
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:47,074
Same kinda lake. Same kinda town.
Just... little bit shittier.

70
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,040
I've had a girlfriend since high school.

71
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,209
Really? That's sweet.

72
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,045
Yeah, she goes to school in New Jersey.

73
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:02,089
She got a name?

74
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,508
Yeah. Madison Kowalski.

75
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,639
She's really pretty.

76
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,059
Yeah. Super pretty.

77
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,436
I really liked Emily,

78
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,273
but I'd already promised Madison
I'd catch the Greyhound bus

79
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,233
and go and visit her at school
that weekend.

80
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,903
She was staying in a dorm room,
and her bed was too small for two people,

81
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,196
but...

82
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,116
at least her roommate
had gone home, because...

83
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,617
Her grandmother died.

84
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,536
That's too bad.

85
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,539
Whatever. She was old.

86
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,084
Well...

87
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,004
tell Madison I said hello.

88
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:55,559
Madison thought I was a bitch.

89
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,561
Let's go.

90
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:05,235
The parties she took me to
were mostly shit.

91
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,906
The kids drank beer in a basement
done out in cinder block.

92
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:13,785
Some kind of beer pong, sex dungeon,
red-light district bullshit.

93
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,954
Everything was dismal as murder.

94
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,254
All these random dudes knew Madison.

95
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:27,799
She'd only been at the school
a month, but they all knew her somehow.

96
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:36,683
She liked every eye in the room on her,
which is fine. Whatever.

97
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:40,562
It just got a little awkward when you were
the one who was there at the party

98
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:45,234
with the girl who is on top of the table,
fucking a ghost.

99
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:53,742
I had a job, and I'd go to work when
I could have been doing better things,

100
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,536
such as anything. But...

101
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:56,828
I had to work.

102
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:00,457
Old Man Fatook had half a dozen daughters
and granddaughters,

103
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,084
and they all worked at his restaurant.

104
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,629
I don't know if he had any grandsons,
but if he did, none of them worked there.

105
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:09,341
All of the granddaughters drove Escalades
or Denalis or whatever.

106
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:10,843
Some of the waiters dated 'em.

107
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:13,053
And she likes to take it up the ass.

108
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,973
Shove her face down in the pillow.
Spit on her.

109
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,141
I think she's really fucking crazy.

110
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,727
I wonder who taught her all that shit.

111
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,564
-Hey.
-Hey.

112
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,691
Come on. Let me see you do it.

113
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,577
Oh, no. Fuck, shit. Shit! Fuck!

114
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,495
Are you a man or what?

115
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,998
Throw it high. High!

116
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,876
So they can hear it in the dining room,
cocksucker.

117
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:48,213
-Fuck this guy.
-Yeah, I know. Fuck him. Fuck him.

118
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:49,840
I only lasted two weeks.

119
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,678
After work
I went by James Lightfoot's house.

120
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,805
He was my best friend since grade school.

121
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:58,849
His dad had died when he was young and...

122
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,602
and so did his mother. And then...

123
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,981
And then his brother came back
all fucked from the war,

124
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,691
so James is mostly alone.

125
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:12,196
Hey, man.

126
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,449
Except for me.

127
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,453
-You okay?
-Yeah.

128
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,874
I needed a ride to the bank,
so James offered to take me.

129
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:31,507
The sun was shining on us that day.

130
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,760
And Roy also came.

131
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,308
He painted houses, but he wasn't working.

132
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,559
What's up?

133
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:45,229
And James Lightfoot was yelling at Roy
about his cousin Joe,

134
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,106
-because Joe kept saying...
-I'm going, so just drop it.

135
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,652
Roy. Roy. Did you tell him?
You gotta tell your cousin

136
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,737
-he can't join the marines.
-Why do I gotta tell him?

137
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,740
-He's joining the marines.
-Don't join the marines, man.

138
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,076
Give me one good reason why, okay?

139
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,119
I don't wanna do this
for the rest of my life.

140
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:02,538
Why do you wanna join?

141
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,289
I don't wanna do this
for the rest of my life.

142
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:07,167
Why are you content
just fucking driving around, man?

143
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,086
I don't understand
why you're okay with it.

144
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,547
He wants to do a thing.
Just let him do a thing. Fuck.

145
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,132
It's an obligation of you
and your love for your cousin,

146
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,342
who we all love so much.

147
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,970
Now you're telling me, "I wanna
send him off to his fucking death"?

148
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,137
What are you doing?

149
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:22,891
-What are you thinking?
-I've signed up, man. It's over.

150
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:26,019
I could only understand half
of what James was saying.

151
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,939
I couldn't help noticing
that he looked helpless,

152
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,566
waving his arms around,

153
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:35,237
and that probably no one would ever
listen to him for as long as he lived.

154
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:40,367
This is not a shitty car.

155
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,578
It is, man. This is the shittiest car.

156
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:45,455
I just need a cup of water
to cool the engine off.

157
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,165
Get me a cup of water.

158
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,959
I had a problem with the bank.

159
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,628
They'd made a mistake,
and I was there to sort it out.

160
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:01,972
So you guys sent me this overdraft,
but it's not right.

161
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,473
I paid this off already.

162
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:05,559
Here.

163
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,354
This is a new overdraft notice.

164
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:13,317
But that's not possible. I haven't made
a withdrawal since the last deposit.

165
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:17,487
That deposit brought your balance up
to $10 credit.

166
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,866
But there was an additional
overdraft charge against your account

167
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,534
that put you back in the negative.

168
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:26,622
But how could you charge me
another overdraft charge

169
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,457
after I'd paid it off already?

170
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,835
-The deposit didn't clear in time.
-No, but I paid it here in cash.

171
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,047
-It didn't clear, sir.
-It was fucking cash. Right here.

172
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,799
It didn't clear.

173
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,010
Next.

174
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:50,938
Sorry about your car, man.

175
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,025
It was a piece of shit.

176
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,861
Did you get your money back?

177
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:00,072
No.

178
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,994
As we walked back to James's house,
Roy passed around his Trainwreck.

179
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:10,791
And after a few hits,
we felt like we were winning again.

180
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:21,134
The next day was a healthy fall day,
where you could smell the wet leaves.

181
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:24,263
So I went to Shaker Square
to see some kids that I knew.

182
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:29,351
They wanted some of my Xanax,
which I was taking because...

183
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:32,229
I'd had some panic attacks.

184
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:35,315
-Here you go, boys.
-Eat up.

185
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,735
-What you doing later?
-We're going to a party

186
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,946
-at this girl Maggie's house.
-Cool. Can I come?

187
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,573
Yeah, sure. Do you want some...

188
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,616
And in return,
they offered me some ecstasy.

189
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,994
Fuck yeah, I want some ecstasy.

190
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:10,475
Is that you?

191
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:14,104
-Hey.
-Hey.

192
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:15,814
-What are you--
-You know Maggie?

193
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,900
-What?
-You know Maggie?

194
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,152
Yeah, sort of.

195
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,695
Small world.

196
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:23,447
Holy shit.

197
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,490
-What?
-Your pupils are huge.

198
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:31,121
Yeah, I just did some ecstasy.

199
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,289
How is it?

200
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,208
It's actually really good.

201
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,377
I would give you some, but I...

202
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,254
I don't have any more.

203
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:42,216
That's okay. I turned some down earlier.

204
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,970
This weird guy offered me some.
He said that I should pop it in my butt.

205
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,056
What the fuck?

206
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:51,600
-Really?
-Yeah.

207
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,894
-Who the fuck is this guy?
-I don't know.

208
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,771
I don't know. He's definitely gone.

209
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:58,690
It's kinda disrespectful.

210
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:01,276
Yeah, well,
that's just how some boys talk.

211
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,239
Hey, I'm really happy you're here.

212
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:06,615
And why is that?

213
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,577
Because I like you. A lot.

214
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,665
-Shut up.
-I really do.

215
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:16,375
And--

216
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,672
And your jacket's really cool.

217
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,553
And-- What?

218
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:30,055
-I was just thinking.
-What are you thinking?

219
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,558
Just thinking that you're shady.

220
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:39,398
Wanna go for a walk?

221
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,327
Your lips taste amazing.

222
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,541
What happened to Madison Kowalski?

223
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:04,965
That girl's cold-blooded.

224
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,553
I think I adore you.

225
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,523
Do whatever you want, man.

226
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:20,207
Sometimes I feel like I've already seen
everything that's gonna happen...

227
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,292
and it's a nightmare.

228
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,008
What?

229
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,678
Nothing. I just--

230
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,266
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

231
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,776
You don't ever have to be sorry
for the way that you feel.

232
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,322
Why are you being so sweet to me?

233
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:58,287
I have a thing for weak guys.

234
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:04,293
That's how you find
the one to break your heart.

235
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:15,596
Can you look back to when
you met the one you love the most

236
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,764
and remember exactly how it was?

237
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:21,768
Not as in where you were
or what she was wearing,

238
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:25,772
but rather in what you saw in her
that made you say,

239
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:30,235
"Yes, this is what I came here for."

240
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,989
He was on the phone with her,
and I was eavesdropping.

241
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,866
And why were you eavesdropping?

242
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:39,620
-You're a jerk.
-Sorry. I mean,

243
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:42,289
that must've been awful for you.

244
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:46,627
I confronted him about it
the next day, and he tried to buy me off.

245
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,254
Said he'd send me to volleyball camp
if I didn't tell my mom.

246
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:50,339
Damn.

247
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,842
-I really wanted to go to volleyball camp.
-Yeah? So what'd you do?

248
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:55,677
I went to volleyball camp.

249
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,429
And then I told my mom.

250
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,310
Your dad sounds like a dick.

251
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:06,146
Sometimes I feel like love
doesn't actually exist.

252
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:11,360
It's just pheromones
playing tricks on people.

253
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,366
I love you.

254
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:28,043
Thank you.

255
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:25,934
I'm leaving for good
at the end of the semester.

256
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:29,855
-I really wanna go to school in Canada.
-What?

257
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,149
Since when?

258
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,194
Since now.

259
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:38,530
There's this
really great school in Montreal.

260
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:39,781
In Montreal?

261
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,408
Yeah. It's the Paris of Canada.

262
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,660
Yeah, I know what it fucking is.
Please tell me that you're kidding.

263
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:45,787
-This isn't funny.
-Why would I be kidding you?

264
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:51,251
So, what? That's it? We're just
supposed to break up. Just like that?

265
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:55,214
We can't exactly be together when
we live in two different countries, so...

266
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:56,882
Emily, what the fuck?

267
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:01,178
Can you please just be mature about this?

268
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:05,349
Emily, please.

269
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:10,646
Can we not just talk about this, please?
Emily!

270
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,776
Fuck!

271
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:42,427
So, what makes a joker like you
wanna join the United States Army for?

272
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,597
This guy had a face like death,

273
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:47,808
and every other word
out of his mouth was "joker."

274
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,645
-Why aren't you going? Fuck!
-Goddamn joker.

275
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:55,899
I've just been seeing on the news

276
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:57,693
that there are kids dying over there.

277
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,403
You know?

278
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:03,657
Guys from Cleveland who are my age
just trying to do something good,

279
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,911
and here I am, feeling sorry for myself
because my girlfriend broke up with me.

280
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:10,622
Damn.

281
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:12,875
She broke your heart.

282
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:16,670
You're searching
for that gold in the gutter.

283
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:19,173
A sense of purpose, right?

284
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:23,427
Yeah. Sense of purpose.

285
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:27,472
Hot damn! Tell you about purpose.

286
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:29,099
I like him.

287
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:30,225
I was too easy.

288
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:33,270
He knew he had me,
and so by the next day, I was sworn in.

289
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:34,479
Against all enemies.

290
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:37,024
-Foreign and domestic.
-Foreign and domestic.

291
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:39,568
How can you let him go to war?
It's fucking war--

292
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:41,778
-What do you want me to do?
-Talk him out of it.

293
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:44,448
I've already talked to him.
I talk to the motherfucker every day.

294
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:45,657
You talk to him every day.

295
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:48,035
But you haven't tried to talk him out
of it. He'll listen to you.

296
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:50,621
James, you fucking slug, dude.
I can fucking hear you.

297
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,748
-I've met your brother, bro. Yes.
-I'm going to fucking Iraq.

298
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:55,959
-Have you met my brother, dude?
-Not everybody ends up like your brother.

299
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:58,420
...have a conversation with him
for two seconds? He's fucked in the head.

300
00:22:58,504 --> 00:22:59,755
Can you please fucking move--

301
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:00,881
Can you move?

302
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:02,716
No, because I'm trying
to fucking help you!

303
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,593
We've had this conversation!
I'm going next week!

304
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:06,970
-I don't know what to tell you!
-What the fuck?

305
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:09,640
-You can't even understand--
-James! James! James! Look!

306
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,016
-What?
-He just doesn't wanna do this

307
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:12,893
for the rest of his life, all right?

308
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,646
Since when do you give a shit, man?

309
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:17,481
You haven't said shit,
and now you're on his side?

310
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,274
Can someone please get
the fucking phone, dude?

311
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:21,068
It's been ringing for, like, 20 minutes.

312
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:23,445
-Listen--
-...fuck out of the way, bro.

313
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:26,365
-Hello?
-Hey. It's me.

314
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,452
-You there?
-Yeah, I'm here.

315
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:32,454
Hey, shut the fuck up, James.

316
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:33,830
Hey, sorry. How you doing?

317
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,083
I'm leaving soon.

318
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:38,585
For Montreal.

319
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,174
Can we say goodbye?

320
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,221
I have work today.

321
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:54,726
-No worries.
-No, no. I wanna say goodbye.

322
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,604
Just come by work.

323
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:06,572
After Fatook's, Roy had got me
a job at another restaurant.

324
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:11,660
The owner was throwing a party that day,
and I got to serve drinks.

325
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:14,538
I told Roy and Joe to come by
so they could drink for free.

326
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:16,915
And I, of course, asked Emily to stop in.

327
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:18,876
But she was late.

328
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:21,170
-You good?
-Yeah, bro, you look good.

329
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:23,255
-What's up, man? Yo, she here yet?
-Not yet. No.

330
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:25,507
Relax. Yo, line up the shots. Honestly.

331
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:30,137
I go to Parris Island on Sunday.

332
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,222
-Parris Island is the marines, right?
-Yeah.

333
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:33,765
It's a good way to go to heaven.

334
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:35,350
Have you seen Emily yet?

335
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:37,394
Hey, breathe, okay?

336
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:39,605
Relax. I don't know
what you're freaking out about.

337
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,940
What the fuck, man? Who is this guy?

338
00:24:42,024 --> 00:24:44,943
I do not have a problem with it
in general...

339
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:46,987
-Yeah.
-...but if it makes you better, then--

340
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:49,489
-Hey.
-Hey.

341
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:54,953
This is Benji. He's from Ghana.
He's going to Case.

342
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:57,497
Benji, hey.

343
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,335
I gave Benji a real man handshake,
like I was a real man,

344
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:03,629
so he was forced to keep his hand off her.

345
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:06,757
You know, I know a better restaurant
we could go to called Mi Aldea.

346
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,967
The food is so good there.
I think maybe we should go.

347
00:25:09,051 --> 00:25:10,594
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-No, you can't.

348
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,012
-Why not?
-Because you're being a--

349
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:14,973
-Sorry, are you all right?
-Benji, just give me a minute, dude.

350
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:16,975
Look, nobody thinks the food
at Mi Aldea's is any good.

351
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:18,936
He knows they don't card there,
and he's trying to get you drunk.

352
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,687
I came to say goodbye.
What's your fucking problem?

353
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:22,022
Want me to punch this guy in the dick?

354
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:23,440
No, Joe.

355
00:25:23,524 --> 00:25:26,360
You came here to say goodbye to me
with him.

356
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:28,070
I'm not with him.

357
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:30,572
-Do you really think that's fucking fair?
-Yeah, I do.

358
00:25:30,656 --> 00:25:33,659
-Please let me punch him in the dick.
-Joe, please go and sit the fuck down.

359
00:25:38,622 --> 00:25:40,249
I gotta work. You should go.

360
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:44,795
I'd like you to leave.

361
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:50,759
Fine.

362
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,080
How you doing?

363
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:21,164
Jesus Christ, dude.

364
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:23,292
-Come on, you gotta cheer up, man.
-Right.

365
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:26,795
The fuck? You could bang ten girls
in here tonight. Throw a fucking rock.

366
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:28,755
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

367
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:31,091
Listen, I need you to do me a favor.
I'm tired. I'm going home.

368
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:33,886
I need you to look after a buddy of mine.
His name is Tommy.

369
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:37,097
That guy over there. Nice guy.
Great guy. Just got out of prison.

370
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:39,016
Tommy was drunk as fuck.

371
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:41,810
And I was supposed to make sure
he didn't throw up in the place.

372
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:44,688
He kept saying everybody was full of shit,
and they were all a...

373
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:48,525
Bunch of fakes over here.
All these Cosa Nostra motherfuckers.

374
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:50,152
They like to talk a big game,

375
00:26:50,235 --> 00:26:52,863
but they ain't got the balls
to put a gun to the guy's head.

376
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:55,949
Put a gun to the guy's head
and blow his brains out.

377
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:57,242
And that's what he kept saying.

378
00:26:57,326 --> 00:27:00,078
They didn't have the balls to put a gun
to a guy's head...

379
00:27:00,162 --> 00:27:01,955
...and blow his brains out.

380
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:04,791
And then he got to asking me what I did.

381
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:08,378
So, what do you do, kid?

382
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:11,131
I actually just joined the army.

383
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:13,008
You joined the army?

384
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:17,638
Those people don't give a shit about you.

385
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,723
What are you thinking?

386
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:25,479
I just...

387
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,440
I didn't have any better ideas.

388
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:31,860
But...

389
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:36,949
do you have the balls to put a gun
to a guy's head and blow his brains out?

390
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:47,167
You'll be all right.

391
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:53,632
All right, I gotta go, Tommy.

392
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:56,885
-Why? Where you going?
-Gotta go to bed. It's late.

393
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:01,807
What, you need a ride?
I'll give youse a ride.

394
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:06,353
-You're good to drive?
-Fucking A, bubba.

395
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:10,399
And Tommy ran over the curb
for good measure.

396
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:12,776
Thanks.

397
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:15,988
-Hey, you drive home safe, okay?
-I will.

398
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:18,949
I never saw him again.

399
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:41,471
Is it okay that I'm here?

400
00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:43,432
Yeah, I...

401
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:46,476
I was gonna bring you these later anyway.

402
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:49,813
Supposed to be a goodbye cake,

403
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:52,900
but they only had muffins ready.

404
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:56,445
And there were supposed to be 12,
but I gave one to this guy Tommy,

405
00:28:56,528 --> 00:28:59,698
because he really needed to eat something.

406
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:02,242
What's wrong?

407
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:04,036
Hey.

408
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,205
I'd never seen Emily cry before.

409
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:08,332
Hey.

410
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,962
I'm sorry about earlier, okay?

411
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:17,049
I told her how I knew she didn't mean
anything by bringing Benji around,

412
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:18,967
and that she was just a sweetheart

413
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:22,596
who believed in diversity
and developing countries.

414
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,014
Stop. Stop.

415
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:31,605
It's all my fault. I'm so sorry.

416
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:34,691
No, no. You never have
to be sorry, baby, okay?

417
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:37,861
You don't ever have to be sorry.
It's okay.

418
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:40,864
It's okay, okay? Hey.

419
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:43,492
I'm so sorry.

420
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:44,660
It's okay.

421
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:50,332
-Hey, you want a muffin?
-Yeah.

422
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:51,917
Yeah.

423
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:54,044
Sure?

424
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,964
Muffin?

425
00:29:57,756 --> 00:29:59,675
It was a while before she stopped crying.

426
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:02,928
And then we laughed.

427
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,180
And then we fucked around...

428
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:08,767
and it was perfect.

429
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:16,275
I'm not gonna go to Montreal.

430
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:42,426
I joined the army.

431
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:47,639
What?

432
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:51,393
Why would you do that?

433
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:55,189
'Cause I was sad, baby.

434
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:56,690
So you joined the army?

435
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:57,774
Yep.

436
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:07,492
Maybe this will be good.

437
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:09,745
I can go away,
and you can go to school in Montreal.

438
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:12,706
-I don't wanna go to school in Montreal.
-I thought you loved Montreal.

439
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:16,335
No. The only reason why I was going
to Montreal was to get away from you.

440
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:22,049
'Cause I love you.

441
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:47,115
Look.

442
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:50,911
I know school is important to you.

443
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,580
And you wanna finish, right?

444
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:55,207
Yeah.

445
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,667
Okay, so...

446
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,795
while you do this...

447
00:32:01,463 --> 00:32:02,548
I'm gonna do that.

448
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:06,552
It's just a couple years.

449
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:10,430
Just a couple years
in a lifetime together.

450
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,686
And I mean that. I really mean that.

451
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:18,939
Like... you're it for me.

452
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:21,942
I feel the same way.

453
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:39,459
Maybe we should get married.

454
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:46,383
So we went down to the courthouse...

455
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:48,886
and we got married.

456
00:32:52,264 --> 00:32:53,765
And then we went to celebrate.

457
00:32:58,145 --> 00:33:01,106
It's as if we were the two
most beautiful things in the world...

458
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,942
and no one had it on us.

459
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:14,786
But the days ran out.

460
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:19,791
And I had to go to basic training.

461
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:33,680
First we got the haircut.

462
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:36,934
Welcome to the army.

463
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:40,646
For the next ten weeks, the next thing
that comes out of your mouth

464
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:43,690
is "Yes, Drill Sergeant,"
and "No, Drill Sergeant."

465
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:45,317
Do I make myself clear?

466
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,568
Yes, Drill Sergeant!

467
00:33:46,652 --> 00:33:49,154
That goes for you
that's getting your hair cut too.

468
00:33:49,238 --> 00:33:53,242
You're not special. You're not special.
Do I make myself clear?

469
00:33:53,325 --> 00:33:55,035
Yes, Drill Sergeant!

470
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:56,787
It needs to be louder than that.

471
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,748
First name Drill, last name Sergeant.

472
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:01,416
Do I make myself clear?

473
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,168
Yes, Drill Sergeant!

474
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:07,631
What are you doing?
You think you're still pretty?

475
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:09,591
-No, Drill Sergeant!
-You think you're still pretty?

476
00:34:09,675 --> 00:34:10,759
No, Drill Sergeant!

477
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:12,344
Then get the fuck up
and get out of my chair!

478
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:14,471
Go away. Go away. Bye-bye.

479
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:17,516
Next, we got about
a hundred fucking shots.

480
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:21,395
-Next.
-And I found out that I was actually...

481
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:22,603
Color blind.

482
00:34:23,938 --> 00:34:25,023
That explains a lot.

483
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:26,567
Can I still be a medic?

484
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,735
You know what color blood is, right?

485
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:29,820
Next.

486
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:32,572
We are your mommy, and we are your daddy.

487
00:34:32,656 --> 00:34:36,659
At no point do you get to do
what you want, when you want.

488
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:38,328
There was a lot of standing in line,

489
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:40,873
and our legs ached
because we weren't used to it.

490
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:42,583
Do I make myself clear?

491
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:44,251
Yes, Drill Sergeant!

492
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:45,793
Do I make myself clear?

493
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:47,212
Yes, Drill Sergeant!

494
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:50,924
-What the fuck is this?
-What are you doing with your arms?

495
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:55,429
Put your fucking arms down!
You are a part of the United States--

496
00:34:57,806 --> 00:35:00,475
Your laces
are gonna be inside of your shoes,

497
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:03,270
and your shoes are gonna be touching.
Execute.

498
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:05,814
Come on. Get 'em off. Now!

499
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:08,817
-Five, four...
-What the fuck is the matter with you?

500
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:10,611
-...three, two...
-Faster, faster, faster!

501
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:12,487
-You've done this a hundred times!
-...one.

502
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:14,364
Execute.

503
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:15,908
Move, goddamn it! Move!

504
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:18,911
-Ten, nine...
-Get your fucking attitude right.

505
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:22,206
...eight, seven...

506
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:26,793
They had us strip down to our underwear
and duckwalk the circuit of a big room.

507
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:31,882
The room smelled of balls, unwashed.
And feet, ditto.

508
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:36,386
All good.

509
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,554
Next.

510
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:40,557
And there was a man whose job it was
to check everybody's asshole.

511
00:35:42,351 --> 00:35:43,393
Drop your pants.

512
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:45,687
I really like this jacket, man.

513
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:48,482
I'm gonna take my girl
out to dinner in this when I get home.

514
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:49,566
Oh, yeah?

515
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,318
Imagine all the patches
and medals on it and shit.

516
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:52,986
You think you're gonna get a medal, huh?

517
00:35:53,654 --> 00:35:54,863
That's Jimenez.

518
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:56,740
I know I am.

519
00:35:56,823 --> 00:36:00,994
We had become friends on account of
the fact that we both wanted to be medics.

520
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:03,914
He'd joined the army
'cause he'd gotten his girl pregnant.

521
00:36:03,997 --> 00:36:07,626
Hey, I love you. So much, okay?

522
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:11,004
And I want this.

523
00:36:12,464 --> 00:36:15,300
I'm gonna get a job.
And I'm gonna take care of both of you.

524
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:16,385
How?

525
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:19,513
We'll figure it out, okay?

526
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:24,059
Look at you, you fucking weak dick flap.

527
00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:25,769
You ain't shit!

528
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:29,106
-There was a lot of yelling.
-Six...

529
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:31,358
Move! Move, dick flap. Let's go!

530
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:33,235
Do you wanna die, you beef curtain?

531
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:35,320
There are hajis breathing down
your piss hole.

532
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:37,573
They called us names like...

533
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:40,951
Dick with ears!
Get up, you dick with ears!

534
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:43,912
-Our hands were...
-Use your goddamn dick skinners!

535
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:45,998
-Our mouths were...
-Cock holster!

536
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:48,458
You shut that ugly cock holster.

537
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:51,086
Drill sergeants pretended
to be real angry all the time.

538
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,171
The fuck?

539
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:56,049
Next time, back the fuck off,

540
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:59,136
or I might wig out
and snap your fucking neck.

541
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:00,345
PTSD, they say.

542
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:02,097
What are you looking at? Eyes forward!

543
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:07,269
Like this one time, Drill Sergeant Cole
punched me in the penis for no reason.

544
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:08,770
Attention!

545
00:37:10,772 --> 00:37:13,442
Drill Sergeant Deco, he even choked a kid.

546
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:15,903
Drill Sergeant Deco.

547
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:20,199
Fucking haji.

548
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:22,409
Drill Sergeant, that's Levine.

549
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:26,496
It wasn't because of PTSD though.

550
00:37:28,123 --> 00:37:31,793
Deco hadn't ever been anywhere.
He was full of shit.

551
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:37,341
Some of the drill sergeants
had actually seen Iraq,

552
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:39,843
but they were full of shit too.

553
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:43,680
In Iraq, there are grenade children

554
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:47,017
who try to sneak up on American soldiers

555
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,229
so as to blow them the fuck up!

556
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:55,692
I had to run over the hand grenade
children with my truck!

557
00:37:56,443 --> 00:37:59,112
That's why I'm sick in the head!

558
00:37:59,196 --> 00:38:02,282
Now, let's go! You need to be
at your three o'clock-- You need to be--

559
00:38:02,366 --> 00:38:05,577
Holy crap, wake up, son!
Wake up, son! Wake up!

560
00:38:08,247 --> 00:38:09,581
-Bang, bang!
-Nine o'clock.

561
00:38:09,665 --> 00:38:10,791
Bang, bang!

562
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:12,709
-Haji left!
-Bang, bang!

563
00:38:12,793 --> 00:38:15,587
Haji on the right.
Haji in the trees! Look up!

564
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:18,006
Sneaking up on you, haji left.

565
00:38:18,757 --> 00:38:20,759
-Haji to the right!
-Haji on your left!

566
00:38:20,843 --> 00:38:22,094
Haji to the left!

567
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:24,638
-Haji on your left!
-Haji to the right!

568
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:27,891
I started to get this weird feeling
like it was all just make-believe.

569
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:29,184
Bang, bang.

570
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:31,144
That we were just pretending
to be soldiers.

571
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:34,398
The drill sergeants were just
pretending to be drill sergeants.

572
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:37,234
Jabberwocky, jabberwocky,
jabberwocky, jabberwocky...

573
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:42,281
Mishmash, mishmash, mishmash...

574
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:46,285
And the army
was pretending to be the army.

575
00:38:46,368 --> 00:38:49,621
For where'er we go
You will always know

576
00:38:49,705 --> 00:38:53,292
That the army goes rolling along

577
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,961
The only way
not to graduate basic training

578
00:38:56,044 --> 00:38:57,629
was to try and kill yourself.

579
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:02,843
One kid tried to hang himself
from a water pipe in the latrine.

580
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:06,054
Fuck! Shit! Jesus Christ.
Fucking hell, bud.

581
00:39:06,138 --> 00:39:08,473
Help! Drill Sergeant!

582
00:39:08,557 --> 00:39:11,560
He didn't die,
but he didn't graduate either.

583
00:39:11,643 --> 00:39:12,811
Hey, can you hear me?

584
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:14,104
Yeah. Hi.

585
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:16,899
Are you all right?

586
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:22,779
I just snuck out of the barracks.

587
00:39:23,322 --> 00:39:24,656
Yeah, but are you okay?

588
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:31,455
I'm good now.

589
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:37,044
Heads down. Asses down.

590
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:38,795
When they finally taught us
how to be medics,

591
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:40,672
there was a lot of fucking around
with mannequins.

592
00:39:40,756 --> 00:39:42,424
Don't let him bleed out. Get pressure on.

593
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:45,135
-His life is in your hands. Let's go!
-Sucking chest wound!

594
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:47,513
-Ticktock. Ticktock.
-Give that wound a bandage.

595
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:49,473
Apply to body
from inside the bandage wrapper.

596
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:50,557
Pressure on there.

597
00:39:50,641 --> 00:39:53,519
Seal all three sides tight.
Airtight-tight.

598
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:56,355
-Come on. Get it done now.
-Check his back for an exit wound.

599
00:39:56,438 --> 00:39:58,607
There were mannequins
that were just trunks with heads.

600
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:01,318
There were mannequins with
rubber bones sticking out of their legs.

601
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:03,779
There were mannequins
that could squirt fake blood.

602
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:06,406
There were even little baby mannequins
with cherubim faces.

603
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,033
Traumatic amputation.

604
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:13,080
You're a go!
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation!

605
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:15,499
One and two and three and four and five.

606
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:17,793
-Breathe.
-You're a go.

607
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:21,255
Jimenez and I
saved the lives of 47 dummies.

608
00:40:21,797 --> 00:40:23,632
And so we passed the class.

609
00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:24,967
Warrior Medics.

610
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:29,304
You were told to come up
with a company cheer.

611
00:40:30,973 --> 00:40:33,517
You had a week to do this.

612
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:37,187
This is what is called a deadline!

613
00:40:38,856 --> 00:40:42,568
As of now, you have missed the deadline.

614
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:48,282
Now,

615
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:52,494
since you have failed to come up
with a company cheer,

616
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:55,747
I have taken
what is called the initiative...

617
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:00,002
and come up with one you'll have to learn.

618
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:03,172
And this is what he came up with.

619
00:41:03,672 --> 00:41:05,716
Warrior Medics in the fight

620
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:07,759
Warrior Medics in the fight

621
00:41:07,843 --> 00:41:09,761
On the double day and night

622
00:41:09,845 --> 00:41:11,638
On the double day and night

623
00:41:11,722 --> 00:41:13,891
We will beat out all the rest

624
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:15,893
We will beat out all the rest

625
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:17,811
Charlie Company is the best

626
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:19,855
Charlie Company is the best

627
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:21,899
Don't stop, get it, get it

628
00:41:21,982 --> 00:41:23,609
Don't stop, get it, get it

629
00:41:23,692 --> 00:41:25,444
Soldier on, Warrior Medics

630
00:41:25,527 --> 00:41:27,321
Soldier on, Warrior Medics

631
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:34,786
Make way!

632
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,496
Here come the Warrior Medics!

633
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,040
Ooh! Tay!

634
00:41:38,123 --> 00:41:39,458
Here come the Warrior Medics!

635
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,210
Make way!

636
00:41:41,293 --> 00:41:44,087
And from that day on, whenever
the company was called to attention,

637
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:47,341
something that happened no less
than a million times on any given day,

638
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:50,052
the company cheer
was to be recited in its entirety.

639
00:41:50,135 --> 00:41:52,262
-Here come the Warrior Medics!
-No exceptions.

640
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:55,224
You guys are soft like some nice titties.

641
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:57,476
Make way!

642
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:59,978
And to make matters worse, after a while,

643
00:42:00,062 --> 00:42:03,857
it got to be expected that
the guidon bearer, which was me,

644
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:06,360
would do the robot throughout the refrain.

645
00:42:06,443 --> 00:42:07,736
Here come the Warrior Medics!

646
00:42:07,819 --> 00:42:09,112
Make way!

647
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:10,614
Here come the Warrior Medics!

648
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,408
So don't ever join the fucking army.

649
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,500
You were wide awake
when you got on the ground

650
00:43:03,584 --> 00:43:05,252
outside the wire for the first time.

651
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:07,754
You expected to get shot at any moment.

652
00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:11,800
Even if you were in a spot
where you couldn't see anyone for miles,

653
00:43:11,884 --> 00:43:14,469
you were nevertheless sure
that there was a haji out there

654
00:43:14,553 --> 00:43:17,723
who had been waiting all day
just to shoot you.

655
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:28,233
Attention on the net.
Attention on the net. Troops in contact.

656
00:43:28,317 --> 00:43:32,571
Current location, Victor-Sierra 453, 132.

657
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:34,281
Stand by for SALUTE report.

658
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:37,826
Break, break. Raven Base.
This is Quebec-Romeo-Foxtrot.

659
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:41,413
We are seven minutes out,
en route to TIC. Over.

660
00:43:43,373 --> 00:43:45,292
Number one, bump it up.

661
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:49,213
-We have troops in contact.
-All right. Let's get us in there.

662
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:51,465
Contact. At least 17 to 20 people.

663
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:53,383
Activity, coordinated attack.

664
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:55,177
Request immediate support.

665
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,387
We're under heavy fire, vicinity of--

666
00:44:12,027 --> 00:44:14,696
Contact right! Get out! Get out! Get out!

667
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:18,825
Raven Base, Raven Base!
Goddamn it. Raven Base!

668
00:44:18,909 --> 00:44:20,160
Hey, Sarge!

669
00:44:20,244 --> 00:44:22,663
-What have we got?
-We got two wounded over there!

670
00:44:22,746 --> 00:44:25,374
Take those two back here.
I'll get the QRF.

671
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:26,834
-Okay. Copy.
-Move it!

672
00:44:41,974 --> 00:44:43,350
Arnold, take six.

673
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:46,854
And grab your shit. Let's go, go, go!

674
00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:49,189
Fuck! Fuck!

675
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:54,862
Hey! Hey, look at me! Breathe.

676
00:44:56,989 --> 00:44:58,073
Stay on me.

677
00:44:58,156 --> 00:44:59,366
Let's go.

678
00:45:02,828 --> 00:45:03,829
Down!

679
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:07,708
Cover right. Cover right. Go!

680
00:45:14,548 --> 00:45:15,549
Move!

681
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:18,260
Medic up! Medic up!

682
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:22,431
Get down!

683
00:45:27,978 --> 00:45:29,479
Hey! Get some pressure on it.

684
00:45:29,563 --> 00:45:32,482
Get the fuck off me.
Up the hill. Up the hill!

685
00:45:38,197 --> 00:45:39,323
Stay here!

686
00:45:40,949 --> 00:45:42,951
Coming in! What do you need?

687
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:46,413
I got at least two wounded up front!
Get them the fuck out!

688
00:45:46,496 --> 00:45:48,916
-All right. Move, move, move!
-Let's go, let's go!

689
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:50,209
Okay.

690
00:45:56,298 --> 00:45:57,424
Medic!

691
00:45:58,425 --> 00:46:01,220
-Over here. Get his guts in!
-Jesus fuck!

692
00:46:01,303 --> 00:46:04,139
-Bring it in.
-I said get his guts in now!

693
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:09,978
More!

694
00:46:22,574 --> 00:46:24,034
-Everybody.
-Lift him.

695
00:46:24,117 --> 00:46:25,160
-Go!
-Ready?

696
00:46:25,244 --> 00:46:28,247
-Three, two, one!
-Here it is. Here it is.

697
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:31,291
Bird inbound! Bird inbound!
Get the litter up!

698
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:33,377
-Lift up!
-Let's go!

699
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:45,681
In the dust, I could see the man's face.

700
00:46:45,764 --> 00:46:51,019
His eyes were wild and grieving,
and he was in his lizard brain.

701
00:46:51,103 --> 00:46:54,106
Hey! Hey! Look at me! Hey!

702
00:46:55,065 --> 00:46:56,525
We locked eyes, and I said...

703
00:46:56,608 --> 00:46:57,943
I've got you!

704
00:46:58,026 --> 00:47:00,821
I said it real loud,
so he could hear me over the helicopters.

705
00:47:00,904 --> 00:47:04,032
And then I felt embarrassed, because
it was a stupid thing to have said.

706
00:47:04,116 --> 00:47:05,701
All right, let's move on out!

707
00:47:06,827 --> 00:47:08,871
Ready! Ready! Up!

708
00:47:08,954 --> 00:47:10,622
-Up!
-Let's move!

709
00:47:25,721 --> 00:47:27,306
Back! Move back!

710
00:48:24,947 --> 00:48:26,782
Oh, yeah.

711
00:48:53,141 --> 00:48:54,142
Fuck.

712
00:48:54,893 --> 00:48:57,187
This fucking blood won't come out
of my wedding ring.

713
00:49:17,082 --> 00:49:21,044
In the early days, the infantry felt like
they were ten feet tall and invincible.

714
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:22,963
They were impatient to begin killing.

715
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:26,341
They wanted to kill so bad

716
00:49:26,425 --> 00:49:29,469
there was this profligate confidence
in our firepower.

717
00:49:29,553 --> 00:49:31,972
And there was this bullshit camaraderie.

718
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:37,477
At ease!

719
00:49:39,855 --> 00:49:42,065
What in the fuck?

720
00:49:43,609 --> 00:49:47,362
Running. He was just running.
Fast, fast, fast. And then--

721
00:49:56,288 --> 00:49:57,623
Dude, what the fuck happened?

722
00:50:01,919 --> 00:50:04,588
This guy, his guts were hanging out.

723
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,173
We had to put 'em back in.

724
00:50:07,007 --> 00:50:08,300
Getting shot at.

725
00:50:08,759 --> 00:50:11,011
-We had to run up to the chopper.
-Hey.

726
00:50:12,054 --> 00:50:15,307
I heard on the radio those guys
you put in the helicopter are dead.

727
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:17,017
Shit.

728
00:50:18,143 --> 00:50:21,563
Hey, Sarge. Is it true those guys
we put on the bird today are dead?

729
00:50:21,647 --> 00:50:22,648
Who told you that?

730
00:50:23,232 --> 00:50:25,901
-Arnold said he heard it on the net.
-Arnold's a fucking retard.

731
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,114
-I thought that's what I heard, Sarge.
-Shut up, Arnold.

732
00:50:31,907 --> 00:50:34,159
That's Staff Sergeant Greene.

733
00:50:34,243 --> 00:50:36,912
They said he'd already killed 15 hajis.

734
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:39,873
He was a hard motherfucker.

735
00:50:41,124 --> 00:50:42,251
So, they're not dead?

736
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:45,379
Quit worrying about it so much, huh?

737
00:50:46,421 --> 00:50:48,006
You got your cherry popped today.

738
00:50:57,891 --> 00:50:59,893
We took eight fucking casualties today.

739
00:51:00,644 --> 00:51:01,770
Out of 800.

740
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:04,648
And we're here for a fucking year.

741
00:51:05,524 --> 00:51:08,402
A year's worth of fucking days.
Do the math.

742
00:51:09,361 --> 00:51:10,612
We're fucked.

743
00:51:12,447 --> 00:51:14,658
What did you guys think
you were coming here to do?

744
00:51:15,868 --> 00:51:18,537
Damn, Lessing. You're a downer.

745
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,080
Truth hurts, baby.

746
00:51:21,623 --> 00:51:22,875
And he was right.

747
00:51:24,293 --> 00:51:25,961
Everything there was about dying.

748
00:51:28,547 --> 00:51:31,633
They even called the area we were
stationed in "the Triangle of Death."

749
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:40,642
And, like idiots,
we patrolled every inch of it.

750
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:49,151
Most days, it felt like
we were just glorified scarecrows.

751
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:54,031
There to look busy,
expensive as fuck and dumber than shit.

752
00:52:01,246 --> 00:52:04,333
Look at that one in the dress. She looks
like Pebbles from The Flintstones.

753
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:06,376
Oh, yeah. She is kinda cute.

754
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:10,339
That's Sergeant North. He was from Idaho.

755
00:52:10,422 --> 00:52:12,466
-And he was also a killer.
-Stop.

756
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:15,719
You know you want it, bitch.
Fuck! Stop fucking moving.

757
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:23,143
-Mister. Mister.
-You want this? This?

758
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:24,603
You want this?

759
00:52:25,187 --> 00:52:28,732
Move. Get out the way.
Pebbles, come here. Come here, Pebbles.

760
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:30,817
You want this? You want this? Yeah?

761
00:52:37,783 --> 00:52:38,784
Let's go.

762
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:52,798
On Christmas Day,
the Denver Mustang cheerleaders arrived.

763
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:08,355
They waved and bounced
with their white teeth.

764
00:53:08,438 --> 00:53:10,566
The whole thing seemed goddamn awful.

765
00:53:10,649 --> 00:53:13,485
Beautiful women with skin
like expensive cream.

766
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:21,201
It wasn't like they were gonna fuck you.
And that's what it was all about.

767
00:53:21,285 --> 00:53:23,871
You were supposed to want to fuck them,

768
00:53:24,454 --> 00:53:27,374
and they were supposed to not fuck you.

769
00:53:28,667 --> 00:53:29,960
You know you want it, bitch!

770
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:33,088
All right.
Everybody looking at me, say "Hajis."

771
00:53:33,172 --> 00:53:35,382
Hajis!

772
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:38,594
But I was okay with that.
I didn't even watch porn.

773
00:53:38,677 --> 00:53:41,180
USA! USA! USA!

774
00:53:41,763 --> 00:53:43,515
I'd jerk off in the porta-shitters.

775
00:53:45,475 --> 00:53:47,603
Didn't even think of other girls.

776
00:53:49,146 --> 00:53:50,189
Fuck me.

777
00:53:53,859 --> 00:53:55,319
Fuck me.

778
00:53:58,947 --> 00:54:01,074
I'm not ashamed of this.
I just tried to be good.

779
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,829
Miss you so goddamn much, baby.

780
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:07,748
I miss you too.

781
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:10,959
Hey, I've got some really good news.

782
00:54:11,043 --> 00:54:12,085
Oh, yeah? What's that?

783
00:54:12,836 --> 00:54:15,047
Your parents offered to help us buy
a starter home.

784
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:21,136
-You there?
-Yeah, I'm here. I just--

785
00:54:21,845 --> 00:54:23,430
-I'm happy, that's all.
-Time.

786
00:54:24,056 --> 00:54:26,225
-Jesus, man. I'm on the phone.
-Hurry the fuck up.

787
00:54:26,308 --> 00:54:27,768
I'm on the fucking phone, dude.

788
00:54:30,604 --> 00:54:32,439
I think about you everywhere I go, baby.

789
00:54:32,523 --> 00:54:34,316
-Fuck you, new dick.
-Fuck you, motherfucker.

790
00:54:34,399 --> 00:54:37,194
-I'm on the goddamn phone.
-Then hurry the fuck up!

791
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:39,530
-What is it?
-It's nothing, baby. I just--

792
00:54:39,613 --> 00:54:42,616
-I can't wait to be home with you.
-Time, Private.

793
00:54:42,699 --> 00:54:43,951
Fuck.

794
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:46,828
Time, Private!

795
00:54:49,831 --> 00:54:50,958
I gotta go, baby.

796
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:53,502
-I love you.
-I love you too.

797
00:54:55,754 --> 00:54:56,797
It's all yours, Sarge.

798
00:54:58,924 --> 00:55:01,552
Calm the fuck down, towelhead.
Get the fuck back!

799
00:55:01,635 --> 00:55:03,262
Could you ask him what happened?

800
00:55:06,431 --> 00:55:09,977
He says it happened when he was zip-tied,
few days ago.

801
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,395
Jesus.

802
00:55:11,478 --> 00:55:13,480
Dude, look at this guy's hand.

803
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:15,482
Fuck.

804
00:55:16,692 --> 00:55:17,901
Hey, excuse me, Sarge?

805
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:20,195
Yeah?

806
00:55:20,279 --> 00:55:22,447
Would you take a look at this guy's hand?

807
00:55:24,867 --> 00:55:26,118
It's cellulitis.

808
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:29,913
We're out of antibiotics.

809
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:30,998
So?

810
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:34,334
What can I do for this guy?

811
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:37,921
Tell him to eat shit and die.

812
00:55:38,005 --> 00:55:40,340
You gotta tell him to go to a hospital,

813
00:55:40,424 --> 00:55:43,802
see a doctor and get some antibiotics,
'cause we don't have any medicine here.

814
00:55:45,095 --> 00:55:46,138
You're welcome.

815
00:55:46,221 --> 00:55:48,140
-Thanks.
-Make sure he gets to a hospital, okay?

816
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,601
-They won't take us.
-You just gotta try, buddy.

817
00:55:50,684 --> 00:55:51,935
Try your best.

818
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,023
Yes, sir!

819
00:55:59,109 --> 00:56:00,194
All right, who's next?

820
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:07,409
-Please. Please.
-Not these little fuckers again.

821
00:56:09,244 --> 00:56:10,621
Hey, Pebbles, come here.

822
00:56:11,622 --> 00:56:12,873
Nah, she's all right, man.

823
00:56:12,956 --> 00:56:14,208
Come here.

824
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:15,876
What the fuck are you doing?

825
00:56:15,959 --> 00:56:18,253
This is for you, okay?

826
00:56:18,337 --> 00:56:21,048
I want you to have this.
That's for you. All right.

827
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:26,553
Hey!

828
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:29,723
Shit, man! She got hit!

829
00:56:32,017 --> 00:56:33,185
Look at that.

830
00:56:34,311 --> 00:56:35,854
Made her fucking day.

831
00:56:37,814 --> 00:56:39,233
Fuck.

832
00:56:40,234 --> 00:56:41,902
You know what I would love right now?

833
00:56:42,611 --> 00:56:43,862
Taco?

834
00:56:44,988 --> 00:56:47,241
Fuck you, bitch. Fuck you.

835
00:56:47,866 --> 00:56:50,202
Yes, a motherfucking taco.
Yes, I would love a taco.

836
00:56:50,285 --> 00:56:51,620
What do you want in your taco?

837
00:56:51,703 --> 00:56:56,250
Some carne asada, some fucking guacamole,
some onions.

838
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:58,335
What? Yeah. Fuck you.

839
00:56:59,378 --> 00:57:00,671
My girl's the only one.

840
00:57:02,005 --> 00:57:03,507
-For real?
-Yeah. Yeah, bro.

841
00:57:04,675 --> 00:57:06,510
-The only one?
-The only one.

842
00:57:06,593 --> 00:57:08,971
-But Bautista too, right?
-Fuck you, bitch.

843
00:57:10,472 --> 00:57:12,224
What you reckon they're doing right now?

844
00:57:13,934 --> 00:57:16,603
Probably with her new dude.

845
00:57:18,897 --> 00:57:20,315
I'll have to kill him.

846
00:57:21,233 --> 00:57:22,609
Some big-ass dude.

847
00:57:23,527 --> 00:57:25,445
He'd been away a year,

848
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:27,573
and his wife has a one-month-old baby

849
00:57:28,323 --> 00:57:29,992
that she fucking says is his.

850
00:57:33,453 --> 00:57:35,080
I fucking hate it here, dude.

851
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:38,041
I just wanna go home.

852
00:57:42,337 --> 00:57:44,798
Raven Base, Raven Base.

853
00:57:45,465 --> 00:57:47,843
This is Echo-5-November, over.

854
00:57:47,926 --> 00:57:49,595
Echo-5-November, this is Raven Base.

855
00:57:49,678 --> 00:57:51,555
Yeah, we're gonna get off this line.

856
00:57:51,638 --> 00:57:53,015
Base copy, over.

857
00:57:53,682 --> 00:57:54,683
Lead, this is two.

858
00:57:54,766 --> 00:57:56,185
Go for lead.

859
00:57:56,268 --> 00:57:58,270
We're gonna get off this line
to the right.

860
00:57:58,353 --> 00:57:59,396
Copy that.

861
00:58:00,689 --> 00:58:02,441
Hey, excuse me, Sergeant North?

862
00:58:02,524 --> 00:58:03,775
What is it, fuckstick?

863
00:58:03,859 --> 00:58:06,445
I don't think we should try and drive
through here, Sergeant.

864
00:58:06,528 --> 00:58:08,155
I think we ought to stay on the road.

865
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:11,325
Is that what you think,
you fucking PFC-wanna-be-a-private?

866
00:58:12,951 --> 00:58:15,537
That road runs right through
an "oh, shit" zone.

867
00:58:15,621 --> 00:58:17,331
You want me to put all these men in danger

868
00:58:17,414 --> 00:58:19,708
'cause you don't wanna save
two fucking minutes?

869
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:22,419
When I went out with First Platoon,
we got four vehicles stuck

870
00:58:22,503 --> 00:58:24,505
trying to drive through this shit,
Sergeant.

871
00:58:25,297 --> 00:58:26,423
Looks fine to me.

872
00:58:27,049 --> 00:58:28,884
It ain't fine.
It's the shit that's underneath--

873
00:58:28,967 --> 00:58:30,552
Enough!

874
00:58:31,136 --> 00:58:32,721
Hold your fucking man pleaser.

875
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:36,475
Floor it, Cheetah.

876
00:58:41,772 --> 00:58:43,482
Stop the vehicle, Private.

877
00:58:44,566 --> 00:58:46,151
Stop the vehicle.

878
00:58:47,277 --> 00:58:50,113
Stop the fucking vehicle! Fuck!

879
00:58:51,907 --> 00:58:54,326
Hey, yo. What did I fucking say, man?

880
00:58:54,409 --> 00:58:55,410
Cheetah!

881
00:58:56,495 --> 00:59:00,707
Get your vitamin-depleted ass up here
and get this POS out of the fucking mud!

882
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:03,377
Hey, I wouldn't do that
if I were you, Sergeant.

883
00:59:03,961 --> 00:59:05,170
That's exactly what we did.

884
00:59:05,254 --> 00:59:07,214
You'll only make things harder
for QRF when they get here.

885
00:59:07,297 --> 00:59:08,674
Shut the fuck up and watch your sector.

886
00:59:08,757 --> 00:59:10,592
You need a Bradley and a tow cable, Sarge.

887
00:59:10,676 --> 00:59:13,512
Shut the fuck up.

888
00:59:14,847 --> 00:59:16,056
Roger that, Sergeant.

889
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:28,819
Fuck this shit.

890
00:59:28,902 --> 00:59:31,655
-Motherfucker.
-It's hot as fuck out here, man.

891
00:59:31,738 --> 00:59:33,031
-I'm so thirsty--
-B!

892
00:59:34,908 --> 00:59:36,618
Go get me a fucking Bradley.

893
00:59:39,454 --> 00:59:40,956
We're gonna be stuck here for--

894
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:43,876
North says QRF can't get here
for a few hours.

895
00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:46,420
He wants me,
Yuri, Lessing and Jimenez to go back

896
00:59:46,503 --> 00:59:49,089
-and get a Bradley with a tow cable.
-Yeah, no shit.

897
00:59:49,173 --> 00:59:51,466
You're on radio watch, smart-ass.

898
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,468
-No, tell him to go fuck himself.
-Really?

899
00:59:53,552 --> 00:59:55,429
Yeah, for real.
Tell him to go fuck himself.

900
00:59:55,512 --> 00:59:57,806
-Bautista!
-Coming now, Sarge!

901
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:00,100
Come on, boys! Let's go! Move out!

902
01:00:00,184 --> 01:00:02,352
-What are you, North's bottom?
-No.

903
01:00:02,436 --> 01:00:05,189
I don't want to spend
the next four hours waiting to be shot.

904
01:00:05,272 --> 01:00:07,149
Guess Cheetah just loves America.

905
01:00:07,232 --> 01:00:08,400
I do.

906
01:00:08,483 --> 01:00:11,862
So let's get out of this fucking shithole
sandbox, and let's go home. Come on!

907
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:14,656
Hey, don't let North
fuck with you too hard, all right?

908
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:16,825
I think he means don't let North
fuck you too hard.

909
01:00:16,909 --> 01:00:18,368
Oh, yeah, he's got a big dick?

910
01:00:18,452 --> 01:00:19,661
Fucking asshole.

911
01:00:41,225 --> 01:00:42,684
Fuck!

912
01:00:44,019 --> 01:00:45,354
Get down! Get down!

913
01:00:45,437 --> 01:00:46,605
Oh, shit!

914
01:00:47,773 --> 01:00:49,274
Don't fucking run into it!

915
01:00:50,192 --> 01:00:52,027
Oh, shit. No, no, no.

916
01:00:53,278 --> 01:00:55,197
No, no. No, no, no.

917
01:00:58,992 --> 01:01:01,203
The smell is something
that you already know.

918
01:01:03,121 --> 01:01:04,748
It's coded in your blood.

919
01:01:05,832 --> 01:01:09,253
The smoke gets in your pores
and every gland.

920
01:01:09,336 --> 01:01:11,421
Your mouth is full of it...

921
01:01:12,923 --> 01:01:15,467
to the point where you
might as well be eating the shit.

922
01:01:28,897 --> 01:01:30,148
No other contact?

923
01:01:30,983 --> 01:01:32,860
No contact. We didn't see anything.

924
01:01:37,114 --> 01:01:38,365
I'll go get me a Bradley.

925
01:01:40,325 --> 01:01:41,869
I'll go get the bodies.

926
01:01:44,955 --> 01:01:46,832
Hey, bring the bags.

927
01:01:57,134 --> 01:01:58,302
Private.

928
01:02:10,105 --> 01:02:11,356
That was Lessing.

929
01:02:13,901 --> 01:02:16,236
Our driver was Yuri.

930
01:02:22,075 --> 01:02:24,077
Our gunner was Bautista.

931
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:30,375
And that--

932
01:02:35,589 --> 01:02:39,593
And that's... Private Jimenez in the back.

933
01:02:44,056 --> 01:02:45,182
Let's get 'em out.

934
01:02:45,265 --> 01:02:49,186
All right. Fuck. Captain-- Fuck.
My gloves are melting, Captain.

935
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:52,898
It's all right.
Just try hooking your arms instead.

936
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,441
Yes, sir.

937
01:02:57,069 --> 01:02:58,237
I got it.

938
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,780
-You good?
-Yeah.

939
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:04,993
All right.

940
01:03:05,077 --> 01:03:06,453
Release.

941
01:03:33,105 --> 01:03:35,232
Mister, mister, mister! MRE!

942
01:03:35,315 --> 01:03:37,943
Mister, mister! Mister, MRE!

943
01:03:38,026 --> 01:03:40,529
MRE, mister! Mister. MRE.

944
01:03:40,612 --> 01:03:42,197
Mister. Mister. MRE!

945
01:03:42,781 --> 01:03:45,993
Mister. MRE. Mister, mister!

946
01:03:46,076 --> 01:03:48,871
Suddenly there was nothing
interesting about it anymore.

947
01:04:00,549 --> 01:04:01,758
There was nothing.

948
01:04:11,393 --> 01:04:13,103
Are you seeing bad things?

949
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:17,357
Yeah, a little.

950
01:04:18,275 --> 01:04:19,860
Are people getting killed?

951
01:04:21,278 --> 01:04:25,657
Because I'm seeing on the news
that people are getting killed.

952
01:04:28,702 --> 01:04:30,746
-Hello?
-Yeah, baby, I'm here.

953
01:04:32,331 --> 01:04:34,166
You're gonna make it through this, okay?

954
01:04:36,502 --> 01:04:38,962
I know that you're gonna
make it through this.

955
01:04:41,423 --> 01:04:43,383
Could you just talk about you
for a second?

956
01:04:44,176 --> 01:04:45,761
What's going on with you?

957
01:04:48,972 --> 01:04:53,018
Well, I got a job as a waitress
down at the Academy,

958
01:04:53,101 --> 01:04:55,646
close to the neighborhood
I think that we should settle on.

959
01:04:56,939 --> 01:04:59,066
You like those streets
over by Larchmere, right?

960
01:05:04,655 --> 01:05:05,739
Baby.

961
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:08,909
Yeah, baby, I'm here. I just...

962
01:05:11,411 --> 01:05:13,205
Are you sure you're doing okay?

963
01:05:13,747 --> 01:05:15,290
I just miss you. That's all.

964
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:17,543
I miss you too.

965
01:05:19,711 --> 01:05:20,712
I love you.

966
01:05:22,047 --> 01:05:23,048
Fuck!

967
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:49,116
Get him out! Fuck!

968
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:51,326
All right! He's good!

969
01:06:28,697 --> 01:06:31,158
After Private First Class Jimenez
was killed in battle,

970
01:06:31,909 --> 01:06:34,369
this soldier went on to take care
of his platoon as well,

971
01:06:35,037 --> 01:06:37,956
serving three platoons in total
to complete more combat missions...

972
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,792
-I really wanna get the fuck out of here.
-...than any other medic in his battalion.

973
01:06:40,876 --> 01:06:43,712
I don't feel like I've done anything
to go running into a gymnasium about.

974
01:06:43,795 --> 01:06:47,174
It is my honor to present to you
the Medal of Valor.

975
01:06:47,257 --> 01:06:49,843
My one true accomplishment was not dying.

976
01:06:50,511 --> 01:06:52,262
And I didn't really have anything
to do with that.

977
01:06:52,971 --> 01:06:55,432
-Congratulations, Specialist.
-Thank you, First Sergeant.

978
01:07:36,265 --> 01:07:39,893
Emily drove me back to Ohio,
and I got to see our new house.

979
01:08:09,131 --> 01:08:11,842
Started taking night classes
at a school Emily was working at,

980
01:08:11,925 --> 01:08:15,345
and I got a job
that paid eight bucks an hour.

981
01:08:16,638 --> 01:08:18,432
Roy's cousin Joe helped me get it.

982
01:08:21,935 --> 01:08:23,854
This coffee is shit.

983
01:08:23,937 --> 01:08:25,564
They're all spoiled fucks.

984
01:08:25,647 --> 01:08:28,358
No one there but Joe and I
had ever had anything to do with war

985
01:08:28,442 --> 01:08:29,984
or murders or anything like that.

986
01:08:31,069 --> 01:08:33,738
The world meant something different
to them than it did to us.

987
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:39,912
And after he got back,
Joe had problems for a while.

988
01:08:39,995 --> 01:08:42,581
All I did was ask you if you really
needed to keep drinking,

989
01:08:42,663 --> 01:08:44,249
seeing as you're already shit-faced.

990
01:08:44,332 --> 01:08:47,461
-And I said that I did.
-And I said no, you did not!

991
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:53,634
-Holy shit!
-Fuck!

992
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:56,136
Stop the car.

993
01:09:00,057 --> 01:09:02,267
He wasn't the only one with problems.

994
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:08,607
I didn't sleep.
And when I did, I dreamt of violence.

995
01:09:09,983 --> 01:09:11,151
Hey.

996
01:09:11,609 --> 01:09:12,694
Hey.

997
01:09:15,906 --> 01:09:17,533
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

998
01:09:19,576 --> 01:09:21,620
-Hey.
-What happened?

999
01:09:22,746 --> 01:09:25,749
I shit blood, I farted blood,
and then I craved sleep.

1000
01:09:45,018 --> 01:09:48,647
Basically I was being a sad,
crazy fuck about the horrors I'd seen.

1001
01:10:12,671 --> 01:10:13,881
Hurry. We'll be late.

1002
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,300
Yeah, baby. Sure.

1003
01:10:37,779 --> 01:10:40,407
Hey, thank you for thinking to do this.

1004
01:10:45,078 --> 01:10:46,997
Why are we the only ones dressed up?

1005
01:10:51,502 --> 01:10:52,544
Doesn't matter.

1006
01:10:53,754 --> 01:10:55,005
Didn't notice.

1007
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:58,800
All these middle-aged people with money,
for Christ's sakes.

1008
01:10:58,884 --> 01:11:02,137
And they can't even be bothered
to wear a jacket to the fucking theater.

1009
01:11:02,221 --> 01:11:03,972
-Stop.
-Yeah, I'm talkin' to you.

1010
01:11:04,056 --> 01:11:05,766
-What's your problem, dude?
-Dude, what's your problem?

1011
01:11:05,849 --> 01:11:08,185
My problem's the fact
you didn't even have the decency

1012
01:11:08,268 --> 01:11:10,479
to take off your L.L.Bean before you came
from the fucking golf club!

1013
01:11:10,562 --> 01:11:12,481
-Please be quiet.
-Okay, tough guy--

1014
01:11:12,564 --> 01:11:14,650
-Fuck you, motherfucker--
-I'd really like to go now.

1015
01:11:14,733 --> 01:11:16,068
No, babe, we're not going anywhere.

1016
01:11:16,151 --> 01:11:17,694
I would really like to leave.

1017
01:11:18,403 --> 01:11:20,906
It's all right, man.
There's nothing to fucking look at.

1018
01:11:20,989 --> 01:11:22,324
This guy's just an asshole.

1019
01:11:22,407 --> 01:11:25,661
Fucking take this L.L.Bean
and shove it up your fucking ass.

1020
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:26,870
Fucking pussy.

1021
01:11:56,817 --> 01:11:57,818
I wanna leave.

1022
01:12:02,155 --> 01:12:06,034
I punched the bathroom mirror on accident
while I was washing my hands.

1023
01:12:07,035 --> 01:12:08,453
-Come on, we gotta go.
-Jesus Christ.

1024
01:12:08,537 --> 01:12:10,330
I mean we gotta go right fucking now.
Let's go.

1025
01:12:18,714 --> 01:12:21,383
And when I went home,
I took a few more Xanax.

1026
01:12:33,896 --> 01:12:36,148
That also happened to be the night
that James Lightfoot

1027
01:12:36,231 --> 01:12:38,483
tried coming around to welcome me back,

1028
01:12:38,567 --> 01:12:40,736
but he got arrested
breaking into my house.

1029
01:12:41,653 --> 01:12:42,696
Hey, man.

1030
01:12:44,448 --> 01:12:45,449
Hey.

1031
01:12:47,743 --> 01:12:48,827
Hey, wake up.

1032
01:12:49,578 --> 01:12:51,330
Hey, man, what the fuck? Who's you?

1033
01:12:51,413 --> 01:12:52,414
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1034
01:12:52,497 --> 01:12:53,749
Sorry--

1035
01:12:53,832 --> 01:12:55,334
Except it wasn't my house.

1036
01:12:55,417 --> 01:12:57,920
The fucking dumb shit
broke into the wrong house.

1037
01:13:00,005 --> 01:13:02,716
Since I left for Iraq,
James had busted up his knee

1038
01:13:02,799 --> 01:13:04,384
working for the Highway Department

1039
01:13:04,468 --> 01:13:06,386
and gotten into using OxyContin
pretty bad.

1040
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:08,805
-I didn't mean to.
-Come on.

1041
01:13:08,889 --> 01:13:12,351
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Come on.

1042
01:13:13,769 --> 01:13:15,729
You fucking pig! Fuck you!

1043
01:13:15,812 --> 01:13:18,857
After I bailed him out,
he started hanging around a lot.

1044
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,028
Dude, are you all right?

1045
01:13:23,111 --> 01:13:26,073
No, no. No, not all right.

1046
01:13:26,907 --> 01:13:28,242
Help me.

1047
01:13:29,952 --> 01:13:31,870
Fuck. Fuck.

1048
01:13:42,339 --> 01:13:43,423
Deep breath.

1049
01:13:55,018 --> 01:13:57,479
Deep. That's right.

1050
01:14:03,110 --> 01:14:05,779
A few weeks later,
James asked me to take him to the bank.

1051
01:14:19,501 --> 01:14:21,795
James wanted me
to talk to the teller for him,

1052
01:14:21,879 --> 01:14:23,630
'cause he said I could talk good.

1053
01:14:26,049 --> 01:14:27,050
Okay.

1054
01:14:27,926 --> 01:14:30,012
So I'm gonna sign my checks over to you.

1055
01:14:30,721 --> 01:14:33,015
And then you're gonna give me
the cash, okay?

1056
01:14:34,641 --> 01:14:36,643
'Cause they won't let me have
a bank account,

1057
01:14:37,352 --> 01:14:39,563
'cause I'm in ChexSystems.

1058
01:14:40,272 --> 01:14:42,232
My credit's totally fucked.

1059
01:14:43,025 --> 01:14:44,026
Come on.

1060
01:14:45,861 --> 01:14:47,279
I can't cash these checks, sir.

1061
01:14:47,362 --> 01:14:48,947
It wasn't exactly a smash hit.

1062
01:14:49,031 --> 01:14:51,950
The teller thought I was being a dick
because I was high on OxyContin,

1063
01:14:52,034 --> 01:14:55,329
and I wasn't exactly trying to hide
the fact that I thought he was an asshole.

1064
01:14:55,412 --> 01:14:56,538
You know what?

1065
01:14:57,247 --> 01:14:59,791
You're an asshole,
and I'd like to speak to your manager.

1066
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:01,543
Well, I am the manager.

1067
01:15:04,213 --> 01:15:07,090
-Well, you're still an asshole.
-Okay.

1068
01:15:07,174 --> 01:15:09,510
-Sir.
-I'm a fucking war veteran, dude.

1069
01:15:09,593 --> 01:15:11,970
And you're fucking treating me
like an undesirable.

1070
01:15:12,054 --> 01:15:13,722
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this,

1071
01:15:13,805 --> 01:15:16,892
but I'm sure as fuck this isn't the way
you're supposed to treat people, fucker.

1072
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:18,352
You have a good day now.

1073
01:15:19,102 --> 01:15:20,562
-Thanks, guys.
-Thank you.

1074
01:15:20,646 --> 01:15:21,730
Thanks for your help.

1075
01:15:22,856 --> 01:15:24,274
Fuck yeah. You get the money?

1076
01:15:24,358 --> 01:15:25,901
No, I didn't get the fucking money.

1077
01:15:33,575 --> 01:15:36,328
Hey, man, it's really unfortunate
how that all just played out.

1078
01:15:37,538 --> 01:15:38,539
Sorry, dude.

1079
01:15:40,791 --> 01:15:43,377
Yeah, well, thanks anyway.

1080
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:44,628
Sure, yeah.

1081
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:49,299
Do you think I could get
some more of those pills?

1082
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:58,517
Everything had changed.
And nothing had changed.

1083
01:16:00,435 --> 01:16:03,230
The problem was, is I really liked Oxy.

1084
01:16:03,313 --> 01:16:07,109
Made me feel a type of way
so I wasn't about taking shit from anyone.

1085
01:16:07,192 --> 01:16:08,819
Where the hell have you been?

1086
01:16:09,945 --> 01:16:11,071
No.

1087
01:16:13,323 --> 01:16:14,700
Where have you been?

1088
01:16:14,783 --> 01:16:16,910
You were supposed to be home
three hours ago.

1089
01:16:16,994 --> 01:16:18,495
What the fuck did you take?

1090
01:16:19,413 --> 01:16:21,456
What are you fucking taking?

1091
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:23,375
I'll tell you
what I haven't been taking...

1092
01:16:24,209 --> 01:16:25,419
is your shit.

1093
01:16:26,295 --> 01:16:29,381
I'm not taking your shit.

1094
01:16:32,551 --> 01:16:35,387
I promised Emily I'd find a better way
of dealing with my war shit

1095
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:36,638
than just taking pills.

1096
01:16:51,361 --> 01:16:53,947
Have you been experiencing
any suicidal thoughts?

1097
01:16:58,327 --> 01:16:59,453
Sometimes, yeah.

1098
01:17:01,205 --> 01:17:04,917
I just feel like if I died in Iraq...

1099
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:07,794
she'd be happier now, you know?

1100
01:17:09,171 --> 01:17:11,215
She would've been sad for a while, but...

1101
01:17:13,759 --> 01:17:15,844
ultimately her life would've been better.

1102
01:17:19,932 --> 01:17:21,183
How long you been back?

1103
01:17:21,266 --> 01:17:22,351
Eight months.

1104
01:17:24,895 --> 01:17:27,064
Have you been evaluated for PTSD before?

1105
01:17:29,399 --> 01:17:30,901
Isn't that what we're doing here?

1106
01:17:33,779 --> 01:17:35,072
I tried.

1107
01:17:36,281 --> 01:17:37,991
You guys kept transferring my file.

1108
01:17:38,075 --> 01:17:41,036
I guess someone left and the new someone
was trying to get caught up.

1109
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:42,496
I don't know.

1110
01:17:47,209 --> 01:17:49,044
Are you currently on any medications?

1111
01:17:49,127 --> 01:17:50,212
Xanax.

1112
01:17:51,505 --> 01:17:53,632
For my anxiety.
But they don't work anymore.

1113
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:56,176
How's your pain level?

1114
01:17:56,927 --> 01:17:58,679
Like, mental pain or physical pain?

1115
01:17:59,221 --> 01:18:00,222
Both.

1116
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:04,393
Nine outta ten.

1117
01:18:06,937 --> 01:18:08,647
Have you ever heard of OxyContin?

1118
01:18:12,317 --> 01:18:13,944
Naturally, Emily was pissed,

1119
01:18:14,027 --> 01:18:16,321
and she'd understandably
reached her limit.

1120
01:18:23,579 --> 01:18:24,746
Fine.

1121
01:18:25,455 --> 01:18:27,499
These are for me now.

1122
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:30,002
Because I would love--

1123
01:18:30,711 --> 01:18:33,297
I would love a break...

1124
01:18:34,506 --> 01:18:37,467
from all of this shit!

1125
01:18:40,345 --> 01:18:42,681
Fuck you!

1126
01:18:58,155 --> 01:19:00,657
I wish I never told you I was leaving.

1127
01:19:07,623 --> 01:19:08,790
For Montreal.

1128
01:19:17,674 --> 01:19:21,220
Remember when you used to wear
that white ribbon around your neck?

1129
01:19:25,265 --> 01:19:26,683
That was my jam.

1130
01:19:29,394 --> 01:19:30,771
Yeah, I liked that.

1131
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:46,078
Can't see that we'll ever
make it back there though.

1132
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,043
No.

1133
01:20:00,551 --> 01:20:02,094
But I'm okay with that.

1134
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:08,892
Yeah.

1135
01:20:12,813 --> 01:20:13,897
Me too.

1136
01:20:28,787 --> 01:20:32,499
And that is how we became addicts.

1137
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:50,058
Babe, how do you want your eggs?

1138
01:20:51,018 --> 01:20:54,104
Can you walk Livinia today?
I need to leave in, like, ten minutes.

1139
01:20:54,188 --> 01:20:55,898
You want 'em scrambled or sunny-side up?

1140
01:20:55,981 --> 01:20:57,524
Scrambled, please. On toast.

1141
01:20:57,608 --> 01:20:59,193
What, like, in a sandwich?

1142
01:20:59,276 --> 01:21:01,862
Yeah, like a sandwich.

1143
01:21:04,823 --> 01:21:09,328
The story of being a dope fiend
is that you could kill yourself real slow,

1144
01:21:10,037 --> 01:21:12,539
but you feel like a million fucking bucks
doing it.

1145
01:21:12,623 --> 01:21:14,041
It's okay.

1146
01:21:14,124 --> 01:21:16,084
Hey, today's the day that I stay late.

1147
01:21:16,168 --> 01:21:19,087
So you need to be there by 5:00,
or I'm not gonna make it through class.

1148
01:21:19,171 --> 01:21:21,965
-Professor's still out.
-I got you, babe, go on.

1149
01:21:22,049 --> 01:21:24,134
-You said 5:00, right?
-5:00 p.m.

1150
01:21:24,218 --> 01:21:26,220
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you.

1151
01:21:27,763 --> 01:21:30,766
At first we said we'd get a dog,
and we wouldn't be dope fiends.

1152
01:21:30,849 --> 01:21:34,686
But we stayed dope fiends,
so now we're just dope fiends with a dog.

1153
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:35,812
I gotta go.

1154
01:21:37,231 --> 01:21:39,024
-I love you.
-Love you too.

1155
01:21:39,650 --> 01:21:40,984
Don't forget.

1156
01:21:43,403 --> 01:21:46,782
"See her knitting in my hand,
and her empty chair ready for her.

1157
01:21:46,865 --> 01:21:50,160
I cry with vexation and disappointment"...

1158
01:21:50,244 --> 01:21:53,413
Lia? Keep reading,
I'm gonna run to the restroom.

1159
01:22:06,468 --> 01:22:07,678
You good?

1160
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,810
Of course, the future looked bad though.

1161
01:22:17,563 --> 01:22:18,814
You went into debt.

1162
01:22:20,148 --> 01:22:24,194
My last GI check got deposited
into the wrong account. And...

1163
01:22:24,278 --> 01:22:27,406
Stabbed your parents in the heart,
over and over and over again.

1164
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:33,996
Old friends stayed away. New friends would
eat your eyes out with a fucking spoon.

1165
01:22:39,418 --> 01:22:40,544
Hey, Black.

1166
01:22:48,844 --> 01:22:51,305
But there was always
more heroin to be done.

1167
01:22:51,388 --> 01:22:54,433
And that would usually serve
to settle things down for a bit.

1168
01:22:55,184 --> 01:22:57,060
If you could front me, like, another 80,

1169
01:22:57,144 --> 01:22:59,563
I got money from the GI Bill
coming in on Friday.

1170
01:23:06,111 --> 01:23:07,529
Flip that grilled cheese for me.

1171
01:23:07,613 --> 01:23:08,947
If you didn't know any better,

1172
01:23:09,031 --> 01:23:12,159
you would've thought that this guy
was Biff from Back to the Future,

1173
01:23:12,242 --> 01:23:13,702
but he wasn't.

1174
01:23:13,785 --> 01:23:15,370
He was Pills...

1175
01:23:16,371 --> 01:23:17,873
and he was Coke.

1176
01:23:20,459 --> 01:23:23,045
Hey, man, you want me to put this
on a plate? It looks done.

1177
01:23:23,128 --> 01:23:25,464
Shelly, come get your toasted cheese.

1178
01:23:31,136 --> 01:23:32,137
Hey.

1179
01:23:33,722 --> 01:23:35,057
What are you guys doing?

1180
01:23:36,141 --> 01:23:37,684
Making some special candy.

1181
01:23:38,602 --> 01:23:39,686
I like candy.

1182
01:23:40,395 --> 01:23:41,396
Can I try it?

1183
01:23:43,774 --> 01:23:44,900
That depends.

1184
01:23:45,901 --> 01:23:50,155
What do you think, junkie?
Should she try some special candy?

1185
01:23:51,323 --> 01:23:54,493
All right, open wide for the choo choo.

1186
01:24:00,165 --> 01:24:03,043
-Choo choo!
-And everyone you met was a fucker.

1187
01:24:03,126 --> 01:24:06,004
Stop fucking with me, dude.
Are you really not gonna front me that 80?

1188
01:24:06,088 --> 01:24:08,590
I don't know, man,
80 is a lot of money to some people.

1189
01:24:08,674 --> 01:24:10,008
Please, dude, come on.

1190
01:24:11,677 --> 01:24:14,930
Maybe. But you gotta
go see a guy in Buckeye for me.

1191
01:24:15,013 --> 01:24:17,307
-Okay.
-Pick up something for Black.

1192
01:24:18,183 --> 01:24:19,268
For Black?

1193
01:24:19,351 --> 01:24:20,978
-Yeah.
-What am I picking up?

1194
01:24:21,061 --> 01:24:23,146
It's a safe.
And don't fucking ask what's in it.

1195
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:24,439
Why, what's in it?

1196
01:24:25,941 --> 01:24:27,317
You're a cunt-nugget.

1197
01:24:29,611 --> 01:24:32,197
Please, please tell me you scored.

1198
01:24:32,281 --> 01:24:33,949
-What the fuck is this?
-What?

1199
01:24:34,533 --> 01:24:36,952
Pills & Coke asked me
to watch a safe for him.

1200
01:24:37,035 --> 01:24:38,245
That fucking guy?

1201
01:24:38,912 --> 01:24:40,080
I hate that fucking guy.

1202
01:24:40,163 --> 01:24:43,458
That fucking guy fronted us,
so it felt like the right thing to do.

1203
01:24:52,217 --> 01:24:53,427
Are you good?

1204
01:24:59,933 --> 01:25:03,896
I told you that guy was a scumbag.
This dope isn't doing shit for me.

1205
01:25:05,939 --> 01:25:10,569
And here you are watching his safe
that probably has all the good shit in it.

1206
01:25:14,406 --> 01:25:18,035
So we called James Lightfoot,
who used to work for a locksmith.

1207
01:25:27,878 --> 01:25:29,046
I can't hear anything.

1208
01:25:36,637 --> 01:25:37,930
Did it work?

1209
01:25:38,013 --> 01:25:41,433
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it totally fucking worked. Genius.

1210
01:25:47,272 --> 01:25:48,482
Hit it, man.

1211
01:25:48,565 --> 01:25:50,943
-Yeah, hit it. Hit it.
-Fuck.

1212
01:25:51,026 --> 01:25:52,319
Get angry, baby.

1213
01:25:53,278 --> 01:25:54,655
It's coming.

1214
01:25:56,865 --> 01:25:57,950
Fuck them.

1215
01:25:58,575 --> 01:25:59,701
What?

1216
01:26:29,982 --> 01:26:31,942
Open the door!

1217
01:26:38,532 --> 01:26:39,825
It's the fucking police.

1218
01:26:42,744 --> 01:26:43,745
It's not the police.

1219
01:26:43,829 --> 01:26:45,622
This is the police!

1220
01:26:46,832 --> 01:26:48,458
It's the fucking police!

1221
01:26:50,002 --> 01:26:51,628
Get rid of all the drugs. Quick! Hurry!

1222
01:26:52,796 --> 01:26:54,089
-Fuck!
-They know about the safe!

1223
01:26:54,173 --> 01:26:55,507
I told you they know about the safe.

1224
01:26:55,591 --> 01:26:57,759
I don't know how they fucking know
about the safe.

1225
01:26:58,343 --> 01:27:00,053
-Fuck, fuck!
-What are you doing?

1226
01:27:00,137 --> 01:27:01,972
-I'm emptying!
-That's not gonna fucking work!

1227
01:27:02,055 --> 01:27:03,056
Fuck! Fuck!

1228
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:04,516
Here.

1229
01:27:08,103 --> 01:27:09,938
-Okay, listen to me.
-Okay.

1230
01:27:10,022 --> 01:27:12,774
Put your hands behind your head
like this, okay? Stay like that.

1231
01:27:12,858 --> 01:27:13,984
Yeah.

1232
01:27:16,653 --> 01:27:18,864
Let's do this nice and peaceful!

1233
01:27:22,993 --> 01:27:24,703
Son of a bitch.

1234
01:27:25,329 --> 01:27:26,830
What a fucking dumbass.

1235
01:27:26,914 --> 01:27:28,123
Come on, open up.

1236
01:27:34,129 --> 01:27:35,172
Come on in, man.

1237
01:27:35,756 --> 01:27:37,132
Cup check.

1238
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:49,061
Dude.

1239
01:27:53,732 --> 01:27:55,943
How much fucking shit was even in there?

1240
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:00,739
Tell me!

1241
01:28:04,034 --> 01:28:05,035
A lot.

1242
01:28:06,161 --> 01:28:07,162
Fuck.

1243
01:28:07,746 --> 01:28:09,790
You said you were the fucking police,
dumbass.

1244
01:28:11,208 --> 01:28:13,418
You fucking put this shit on me,
you doped-up fuck?

1245
01:28:13,502 --> 01:28:15,295
It wasn't my fault! It wasn't my fault!

1246
01:28:15,879 --> 01:28:19,800
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop, you're gonna kill him! Stop!

1247
01:28:30,352 --> 01:28:32,604
All right,
let me tell you what's gonna happen.

1248
01:28:32,688 --> 01:28:36,984
Black is gonna put on his black mask.

1249
01:28:37,067 --> 01:28:39,152
-What?
-His black mask.

1250
01:28:39,236 --> 01:28:41,530
-What black mask? What are you--
-His black mask. His fucking black mask.

1251
01:28:41,613 --> 01:28:43,323
He's gonna put on
his motherfucking black mask!

1252
01:28:43,407 --> 01:28:44,825
Stop saying that!
I don't know what it means.

1253
01:28:44,908 --> 01:28:46,368
He's gonna put on his black mask!

1254
01:28:46,451 --> 01:28:48,078
I don't know what it means!

1255
01:28:50,455 --> 01:28:51,665
He's gonna kill us all.

1256
01:28:53,458 --> 01:28:54,710
He's gonna kill you.

1257
01:28:54,793 --> 01:28:56,253
-He's gonna kill you.
-No.

1258
01:28:56,336 --> 01:28:58,338
He's sure as fuck
gonna kill that cunt-nugget!

1259
01:28:59,006 --> 01:29:01,675
And guess what then?
He's gonna fucking kill me.

1260
01:29:07,222 --> 01:29:08,223
Unless...

1261
01:29:09,016 --> 01:29:10,809
you can give me

1262
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:14,521
a giant fucking shitwad of cash.

1263
01:29:15,397 --> 01:29:16,440
Right now.

1264
01:29:18,025 --> 01:29:19,651
We don't have any money.

1265
01:29:21,778 --> 01:29:23,447
We don't even have dog food.

1266
01:29:25,532 --> 01:29:26,658
I have a plan.

1267
01:29:28,744 --> 01:29:29,870
I have a plan.

1268
01:30:48,615 --> 01:30:50,659
Okay, we're square.

1269
01:31:17,102 --> 01:31:18,103
Oh, my God.

1270
01:31:20,522 --> 01:31:21,732
How much did you...

1271
01:31:24,109 --> 01:31:25,152
Oh, my God.

1272
01:31:27,696 --> 01:31:29,239
That's a lot of fucking dope.

1273
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:32,117
And that was cause for a celebration.

1274
01:32:16,119 --> 01:32:17,246
Sorry.

1275
01:32:24,253 --> 01:32:25,254
Hello?

1276
01:32:25,337 --> 01:32:26,755
Hey. Joe.

1277
01:32:29,383 --> 01:32:31,885
-Joe?
-Yeah. Roy's cousin Joe.

1278
01:32:32,427 --> 01:32:34,388
Oh, fuck. Hey, Joe, what's up, man?

1279
01:32:34,471 --> 01:32:37,599
Hey, man, did you rob a bank today?

1280
01:32:43,105 --> 01:32:44,523
I'm going to fucking jail, babe.

1281
01:32:44,606 --> 01:32:48,944
No. No, here. It says the suspect
is six foot and has blue eyes.

1282
01:32:49,027 --> 01:32:51,154
-You're okay.
-Yeah, but look at the fucking picture.

1283
01:32:51,238 --> 01:32:52,489
Does it look like me?

1284
01:33:00,956 --> 01:33:03,458
Yeah, maybe you shouldn't
leave the house for a while.

1285
01:33:04,042 --> 01:33:05,961
The essential problem
of being a drug addict

1286
01:33:06,044 --> 01:33:08,672
is that whenever you get flush,
you spend it on dope.

1287
01:33:12,926 --> 01:33:16,221
Until the money's gone.
And when the dope's gone, you get sick.

1288
01:33:22,186 --> 01:33:24,188
At which point
you need to find more money.

1289
01:33:24,271 --> 01:33:26,565
Go rob another fucking bank!

1290
01:33:34,781 --> 01:33:36,033
Are you okay?

1291
01:33:36,575 --> 01:33:37,910
It was just a sneeze.

1292
01:33:39,244 --> 01:33:41,705
Look, I really think you're sick, man.

1293
01:33:41,788 --> 01:33:44,625
No, I'm fine, I just can't stop sneezing.

1294
01:34:05,437 --> 01:34:07,648
I don't imagine that anyone
goes in for a robbery

1295
01:34:07,731 --> 01:34:09,650
if they're not in some kind
of desperation.

1296
01:34:10,692 --> 01:34:12,861
With robbery it's a matter
of pure abasement.

1297
01:34:12,945 --> 01:34:14,071
Thank you.

1298
01:34:14,154 --> 01:34:15,489
And we were abased.

1299
01:34:18,283 --> 01:34:20,869
What's crazy is, is that 80% of the time

1300
01:34:20,953 --> 01:34:23,038
the tellers really don't mind
if you're holding up the bank.

1301
01:34:23,622 --> 01:34:25,040
There are exceptions, of course,

1302
01:34:25,123 --> 01:34:27,793
like this one lady on the West Side,
looked like Janet Reno.

1303
01:34:27,876 --> 01:34:29,795
That's as high as I go.

1304
01:34:32,381 --> 01:34:33,632
You fucking kidding me?

1305
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:40,430
You can read, right?

1306
01:34:41,014 --> 01:34:42,975
That's as high as I go.

1307
01:34:43,934 --> 01:34:46,645
But this was a fanatic.
Usually it's very civilized.

1308
01:34:46,728 --> 01:34:47,729
Hey, babe.

1309
01:34:47,813 --> 01:34:49,022
You all right?

1310
01:34:49,106 --> 01:34:52,109
-Where were you?
-I was at the bank. I couldn't get much.

1311
01:34:52,192 --> 01:34:54,319
Feel like a fucking purse snatcher.

1312
01:34:56,905 --> 01:35:00,117
Yeah, this is the one. All right.

1313
01:35:05,789 --> 01:35:08,792
How is it that you can rob
all these fucking goddamn banks,

1314
01:35:08,876 --> 01:35:11,879
and yet somehow, in some fucking way,

1315
01:35:11,962 --> 01:35:14,673
you still owe me a fuck ton of money?

1316
01:35:17,801 --> 01:35:19,261
What the fuck?

1317
01:35:20,179 --> 01:35:22,097
'Cause we shoot
a lot of fucking dope, man.

1318
01:35:22,181 --> 01:35:24,016
You need to shoot a lot less,
motherfucker,

1319
01:35:24,099 --> 01:35:25,893
'cause when you owe me money,
I owe Black money.

1320
01:35:25,976 --> 01:35:28,103
And Black does not like
being owed fucking money.

1321
01:35:28,187 --> 01:35:30,814
That's good shit, right?
I'll meet you around the corner.

1322
01:35:30,898 --> 01:35:33,483
What the fuck you talkin' about?

1323
01:35:33,567 --> 01:35:35,402
I told you I needed a driver.

1324
01:35:37,196 --> 01:35:38,906
You did not fucking say that.

1325
01:35:38,989 --> 01:35:40,449
-Yeah, I did. I called you this morning.
-No, no--

1326
01:35:40,532 --> 01:35:42,201
I said I needed a driver for the robbery.

1327
01:35:42,284 --> 01:35:45,913
That's not what I fucking heard.
I'm not doing the junkie bank robbery.

1328
01:35:45,996 --> 01:35:48,081
But you just said
that you owe Black money.

1329
01:35:48,165 --> 01:35:49,625
Yeah! Because you owe me money.

1330
01:35:49,708 --> 01:35:51,418
Do you wanna pay him back or not?

1331
01:35:54,755 --> 01:35:56,423
We gotta discuss terms, dude.

1332
01:35:56,507 --> 01:35:58,926
The fucking terms are simple.
I'm gonna go rob the fucking bank,

1333
01:35:59,009 --> 01:36:01,094
you're gonna meet me round the corner
so you can pay Black back.

1334
01:36:01,178 --> 01:36:02,429
I don't like those terms.

1335
01:36:02,513 --> 01:36:04,264
-I may or may not be there--
-Those are the terms, man.

1336
01:36:04,348 --> 01:36:06,558
Motherfucking piece of shit.

1337
01:36:06,642 --> 01:36:08,227
Those are the fucking terms!

1338
01:36:14,274 --> 01:36:16,151
Come on, Sheina,
I know you can do better than that.

1339
01:36:16,235 --> 01:36:17,486
That's a lot of money.

1340
01:36:18,111 --> 01:36:20,280
That's a 50 banded to some fucking ones.

1341
01:36:20,364 --> 01:36:22,074
I said all the money in your drawer.

1342
01:36:26,411 --> 01:36:29,665
That guy couldn't give a shit about
what's happening with you right now.

1343
01:36:29,748 --> 01:36:31,708
I'm not fucking around.

1344
01:36:46,181 --> 01:36:47,641
I'll flash my gun on the way out,

1345
01:36:47,724 --> 01:36:50,352
so he knows you didn't
just give the money away.

1346
01:36:50,435 --> 01:36:52,354
That supposed to make you a good guy now?

1347
01:36:58,569 --> 01:37:00,612
Did you fight for this fucking country?

1348
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:07,160
You know what
fucking terms we never discussed?

1349
01:37:07,244 --> 01:37:11,874
The ones where you're in my car with me,
and the motherfucking police shoot us!

1350
01:37:12,958 --> 01:37:16,086
We never fucking discussed those terms,
you fucking junkie.

1351
01:37:25,012 --> 01:37:27,806
Where were you? It's Wednesday.

1352
01:37:28,432 --> 01:37:30,726
You were supposed to come down
to school and meet me by 5:00.

1353
01:37:32,352 --> 01:37:34,813
I'm sorry, baby.
I was getting really sick.

1354
01:37:34,897 --> 01:37:37,983
Yeah, well, now I'm sick,
and I had to cancel my fucking class

1355
01:37:38,066 --> 01:37:40,360
because I shit my motherfucking pants.

1356
01:37:41,862 --> 01:37:42,863
Fuck.

1357
01:37:44,948 --> 01:37:48,619
I'm trying really hard
to do something here.

1358
01:37:48,702 --> 01:37:50,162
I'm not just trying to...

1359
01:37:51,205 --> 01:37:56,335
sit at home on the fucking couch,
enjoying my motherfucking high.

1360
01:38:02,216 --> 01:38:04,343
-Fuck!
-The fuck is this?

1361
01:38:17,439 --> 01:38:20,692
-Baby, all right, fuck.
-I can't fucking...

1362
01:38:22,528 --> 01:38:24,738
I can't fucking do it.

1363
01:38:26,114 --> 01:38:28,534
-It's all right, baby.
-Will you please help me?

1364
01:38:28,617 --> 01:38:32,579
Come on, come here.
It's all right. I got you.

1365
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:38,544
It's all right. Here, tie yourself up.

1366
01:38:55,143 --> 01:38:56,228
All right.

1367
01:38:57,312 --> 01:38:58,647
Are you ready?

1368
01:39:23,046 --> 01:39:25,757
I'm right here with you.
Would you hurry the fuck up, please?

1369
01:39:25,841 --> 01:39:27,634
You gotta calm down and let us do our job.

1370
01:39:27,718 --> 01:39:29,970
Baby? I'm right here.
I'm right by your side.

1371
01:39:30,053 --> 01:39:32,890
I'm not gonna fucking leave you, okay?
I got you. Okay?

1372
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:37,936
Female, 22.
Agonal breathing, pinpoint pupils.

1373
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:39,688
-Please.
-Rapid heart rate...

1374
01:39:39,771 --> 01:39:41,857
I just got to be here with my wife.

1375
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:43,859
Sir, I need you to go to the waiting room.

1376
01:39:43,942 --> 01:39:45,694
Okay, I can go.
But could you please just--

1377
01:39:45,777 --> 01:39:47,571
-Can I stay for five minutes?
-No, listen.

1378
01:39:47,654 --> 01:39:49,990
There's nothing you can do in here
but get in the way.

1379
01:39:50,073 --> 01:39:51,867
Sir. There's nothing you can do.

1380
01:39:51,950 --> 01:39:53,243
Okay, I'm going.

1381
01:39:53,327 --> 01:39:54,995
-Oh, Jesus.
-Ready, go.

1382
01:39:55,078 --> 01:39:57,789
-No response here.
-Take over the airway.

1383
01:39:57,873 --> 01:39:59,333
Hooking up the monitor.

1384
01:39:59,416 --> 01:40:02,419
-We're gonna do the best we can.
-I don't know what I would do without her.

1385
01:40:02,503 --> 01:40:04,254
Okay? We're gonna do the best we can.

1386
01:40:04,338 --> 01:40:05,589
Emily, I'm outside, baby.

1387
01:40:06,173 --> 01:40:08,091
I need you to calm down
and tell me what happened.

1388
01:40:08,675 --> 01:40:10,135
I don't know what happened.

1389
01:40:11,887 --> 01:40:12,930
Help me out here.

1390
01:40:13,013 --> 01:40:15,307
I need you to calm down
and tell me what happened.

1391
01:40:16,725 --> 01:40:18,393
We were home and we fell asleep,

1392
01:40:18,477 --> 01:40:20,521
and then she fucking woke up
and she was blue.

1393
01:40:20,604 --> 01:40:22,314
-How long was she unconscious?
-I don't know.

1394
01:40:22,397 --> 01:40:23,565
What did she take?

1395
01:40:24,650 --> 01:40:26,151
-I don't know.
-What did she take?

1396
01:40:26,235 --> 01:40:28,654
I don't know, ma'am. I don't fucking know.

1397
01:40:28,737 --> 01:40:31,448
Listen, help us help her.
I need to know what she took.

1398
01:40:31,532 --> 01:40:33,992
Can you please just tell me
if she's breathing or not?

1399
01:40:34,493 --> 01:40:35,994
Please, I'm a medic, ma'am.

1400
01:40:36,078 --> 01:40:39,414
We're trying the best that we can, okay?
I need you to tell me what she took.

1401
01:40:39,498 --> 01:40:42,251
Paging Dr. Staman. Dr. Staman, please.

1402
01:40:42,835 --> 01:40:44,211
She took heroin.

1403
01:40:50,259 --> 01:40:51,885
I love you.

1404
01:40:55,013 --> 01:40:56,890
I know you've got problems.

1405
01:41:00,769 --> 01:41:02,604
I know you're broken.

1406
01:41:05,482 --> 01:41:07,776
But please don't break my daughter.

1407
01:41:13,031 --> 01:41:14,408
If you love her...

1408
01:41:17,244 --> 01:41:19,162
then you'll be a man and walk away.

1409
01:41:24,918 --> 01:41:27,713
You get up and walk away.

1410
01:41:32,342 --> 01:41:33,886
Or I'll fuck you up.

1411
01:42:27,022 --> 01:42:28,941
Fuck! Fuck you!

1412
01:42:29,024 --> 01:42:31,068
Fuck!

1413
01:43:44,808 --> 01:43:46,518
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Hold on.

1414
01:43:46,602 --> 01:43:48,729
-Hey, is this bus going to Elba?
-What the fuck are you doing?

1415
01:43:48,812 --> 01:43:49,897
Hey, get back on the bus, Em.

1416
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:51,773
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Emily, get back on the bus.

1417
01:43:51,857 --> 01:43:53,317
I'm not getting back on that fucking bus!

1418
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:54,818
-Listen to me, Emily.
-What the--

1419
01:43:56,820 --> 01:43:59,198
Baby, fucking listen to me, all right?

1420
01:43:59,781 --> 01:44:01,533
-Hey, are you all right?
-Yeah, I'm all right.

1421
01:44:01,617 --> 01:44:02,743
-Sorry.
-Just don't touch her, bro.

1422
01:44:02,826 --> 01:44:04,244
Yes, sir. Understood.

1423
01:44:12,628 --> 01:44:14,379
Emily, you gotta go back to rehab.

1424
01:44:16,381 --> 01:44:17,674
I don't wanna be in rehab.

1425
01:44:20,302 --> 01:44:21,386
I wanna be with you.

1426
01:44:24,264 --> 01:44:25,766
You can't be here with me.

1427
01:44:25,849 --> 01:44:27,684
That's not your decision to make.

1428
01:44:29,353 --> 01:44:31,480
-Yes, it is my decision--
-No, it's not your decision to make.

1429
01:44:31,563 --> 01:44:32,981
-Yes, it is my--
-It's not--

1430
01:44:33,065 --> 01:44:36,527
-Yes, it is!
-It is not your decision to make!

1431
01:44:42,866 --> 01:44:46,370
I waited two years...

1432
01:44:47,412 --> 01:44:50,082
for you to come back from that hellhole.

1433
01:44:50,165 --> 01:44:51,416
Two years.

1434
01:44:53,919 --> 01:44:56,797
And I stayed with you
through so much fucked-up shit.

1435
01:45:02,636 --> 01:45:04,721
And I really don't wanna do this alone.

1436
01:45:06,265 --> 01:45:08,100
Please don't make me do this alone.

1437
01:45:10,894 --> 01:45:14,022
I'm so sorry... but I can't.

1438
01:45:14,106 --> 01:45:15,524
I'm not good for you.

1439
01:45:16,608 --> 01:45:18,110
I'm not good for anything.

1440
01:45:22,281 --> 01:45:23,949
I have this noise in my head.

1441
01:45:26,368 --> 01:45:27,744
I can't...

1442
01:45:27,828 --> 01:45:29,663
-Baby, stop.
-It's so goddamn loud,

1443
01:45:29,746 --> 01:45:32,040
and I can't make it stop.

1444
01:45:33,250 --> 01:45:34,251
It'll stop.

1445
01:45:35,002 --> 01:45:38,088
One day it'll just-- it'll go quiet.

1446
01:45:46,388 --> 01:45:48,432
Can you please just get back on the bus?

1447
01:45:50,058 --> 01:45:51,059
For me?

1448
01:45:57,524 --> 01:45:59,484
I'm gonna get high with or without you.

1449
01:46:04,239 --> 01:46:05,324
Please don't.

1450
01:46:07,284 --> 01:46:08,535
Please, baby, just...

1451
01:46:13,957 --> 01:46:15,167
I'm gonna get high.

1452
01:47:09,888 --> 01:47:12,933
It's not even that interesting. The bank's
not gonna fight you over the cash.

1453
01:47:13,016 --> 01:47:15,894
They don't even care.
It's like taking sand from a beach.

1454
01:47:17,980 --> 01:47:20,566
-But it's somebody's money.
-No, it's the bank's money.

1455
01:47:21,149 --> 01:47:23,235
Do you need the money
or do you not need the money?

1456
01:47:23,318 --> 01:47:24,528
Of course I need the money.

1457
01:47:24,611 --> 01:47:27,364
All right, well, I can get a lot more
if we hit all the tellers.

1458
01:47:27,447 --> 01:47:29,241
But to hit all the tellers, I need you.

1459
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:32,995
But if we're both pulling the robbery,
why am I only getting 10%?

1460
01:47:34,955 --> 01:47:37,749
Because I'm the one doing
all the talking and carrying the gun.

1461
01:47:37,833 --> 01:47:41,003
All right? If you were carrying the gun
and threatening all the innocents,

1462
01:47:41,086 --> 01:47:42,796
it'd be a different story, huh?

1463
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,631
-Then give me the gun.
-No, I'm not gonna give you the gun.

1464
01:47:44,715 --> 01:47:46,633
-You just said if I had the gun--
-I don't care what I just said!

1465
01:47:46,717 --> 01:47:48,093
We're gonna do what we originally agreed.

1466
01:47:48,177 --> 01:47:51,597
Jesus. Can you stop being
such a flaming fucking pussy, dude?

1467
01:47:57,644 --> 01:47:59,188
Fuck it, let's do it.

1468
01:48:03,734 --> 01:48:05,444
No alarms! I said no alarms!

1469
01:48:05,527 --> 01:48:09,531
Sir, don't you touch that fucking phone!
Don't you touch that phone!

1470
01:48:11,617 --> 01:48:14,536
All right, I want everybody
to give their money to this man here.

1471
01:48:23,754 --> 01:48:25,839
Don't you touch that fucking phone.

1472
01:48:28,634 --> 01:48:29,635
Fuck!

1473
01:48:31,345 --> 01:48:34,348
Go, go, go! Go, go!

1474
01:48:36,683 --> 01:48:37,809
The fuck, man?

1475
01:48:37,893 --> 01:48:40,437
-The fuck is wrong with you?
-Fucking infamous.

1476
01:48:40,521 --> 01:48:43,315
-Man, I'm sorry.
-What do we do now?

1477
01:48:43,398 --> 01:48:44,775
I don't fucking know.

1478
01:48:44,858 --> 01:48:46,360
How about we do it again?

1479
01:48:46,443 --> 01:48:48,320
I can drive,
and you and Pills do the robbing.

1480
01:48:48,403 --> 01:48:50,948
So now I've gotta rob a bank
'cause you're a fucking pussy?

1481
01:48:51,031 --> 01:48:52,824
I'm just not good at robberies.

1482
01:48:52,908 --> 01:48:55,744
Pills, look,
it's three, four times the money.

1483
01:48:57,871 --> 01:48:59,706
Fucking nerves are shot, man.

1484
01:49:01,375 --> 01:49:02,417
Come on, man.

1485
01:49:04,086 --> 01:49:05,712
All right, but I'm having the gun.

1486
01:49:05,796 --> 01:49:08,298
-No, you're not having the gun.
-I am! I'm having the fucking gun!

1487
01:49:08,382 --> 01:49:10,133
And you're a junkie motherfucker.

1488
01:49:11,802 --> 01:49:13,011
With PTSD.

1489
01:49:22,521 --> 01:49:24,064
The fuck is going on with you, man?

1490
01:49:24,648 --> 01:49:26,608
-Probably the Klonnie.
-What Klonnie?

1491
01:49:27,651 --> 01:49:29,945
-My nerves were shot, man.
-You took fucking Klonnie?

1492
01:49:30,028 --> 01:49:31,113
Just some.

1493
01:49:31,780 --> 01:49:33,156
-Are you good for this?
-I'm good.

1494
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:34,783
Are you good for this?

1495
01:49:34,867 --> 01:49:36,869
I'm good, motherfucker. Let's do this.

1496
01:49:36,952 --> 01:49:38,161
Put that fucking down.

1497
01:49:40,372 --> 01:49:42,749
All right, everyone,
give your man this money.

1498
01:49:43,876 --> 01:49:45,085
Now!

1499
01:49:45,752 --> 01:49:46,753
Shit.

1500
01:49:48,088 --> 01:49:50,132
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Give me the fucking gun.

1501
01:49:50,215 --> 01:49:52,634
-Fuck, man.
-Take this, get the fucking cash and go.

1502
01:49:52,718 --> 01:49:54,511
-Ma'am, get off the fucking phone!
-Get down.

1503
01:50:06,899 --> 01:50:08,609
-Go, go.
-Come on. Come on.

1504
01:50:11,278 --> 01:50:13,697
What happened? Did you shoot somebody?

1505
01:50:14,781 --> 01:50:17,409
-No.
-Where's Pills & Coke?

1506
01:50:17,492 --> 01:50:20,245
He fucking bailed, man. He bailed.

1507
01:50:20,329 --> 01:50:22,289
Where you going?
What the fuck are you doing?

1508
01:50:22,372 --> 01:50:24,124
Get the fucking-- Fuck.

1509
01:50:24,666 --> 01:50:26,418
Everybody, give me your cash.

1510
01:50:26,502 --> 01:50:29,630
Open the fucking drawer.
Get it out now! Hurry up.

1511
01:50:29,713 --> 01:50:30,797
Fuck.

1512
01:50:32,174 --> 01:50:34,968
We can't leave him.
He's gonna rat on us in a heartbeat, dude.

1513
01:50:35,052 --> 01:50:36,553
We gotta go back and get him.

1514
01:50:37,429 --> 01:50:38,931
-No.
-What do you mean, no, James?

1515
01:50:39,014 --> 01:50:40,557
Turn the fucking car around!

1516
01:50:41,058 --> 01:50:42,059
Fuck.

1517
01:50:54,571 --> 01:50:56,281
Never lock a gunman in
with innocent people.

1518
01:50:56,365 --> 01:50:58,867
You're supposed to lock me
in between the fucking doors.

1519
01:50:58,951 --> 01:51:01,245
What's the matter with you people?
Are you retarded?

1520
01:51:02,329 --> 01:51:06,834
-James, turn this fucking car around! Now!
-No.

1521
01:51:07,417 --> 01:51:10,170
Okay. Okay.

1522
01:51:10,254 --> 01:51:12,256
The police are on their way.

1523
01:51:16,093 --> 01:51:18,679
Open the door right now.

1524
01:51:21,265 --> 01:51:23,100
Look, you've put all these people's lives
in danger.

1525
01:51:23,183 --> 01:51:25,978
If you don't open that fucking door,
your boss is gonna fire you.

1526
01:51:27,938 --> 01:51:29,189
What the fuck was that?

1527
01:51:29,273 --> 01:51:31,316
-I don't like this.
-Did you hear that?

1528
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:33,485
I don't like this, man. I don't like this.

1529
01:51:34,069 --> 01:51:35,320
You see him?

1530
01:51:45,622 --> 01:51:48,375
Is that him? I see him.
That's him, that's him. Stop the car.

1531
01:51:50,878 --> 01:51:52,629
Dude, get in the fucking car. Come on.

1532
01:51:53,130 --> 01:51:57,259
The fuck are you doing?
Get in the fucking car now!

1533
01:52:00,262 --> 01:52:01,847
Get in the car.

1534
01:52:03,098 --> 01:52:04,099
Fuck.

1535
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:05,601
Go.

1536
01:52:06,268 --> 01:52:08,145
The fuck is wrong with you, man?

1537
01:52:10,397 --> 01:52:11,732
This is all your fault.

1538
01:52:11,815 --> 01:52:13,525
Should never have fucking brought you.

1539
01:52:21,950 --> 01:52:23,535
Oh, shit.

1540
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:26,496
Oh, fuck.

1541
01:52:26,580 --> 01:52:28,540
-He's been shot, man.
-What the fuck?

1542
01:52:28,624 --> 01:52:31,376
-He's been fucking shot.
-You said nobody fucking got shot.

1543
01:52:31,460 --> 01:52:33,504
Put some pressure on the wound, all right?

1544
01:52:33,587 --> 01:52:36,006
Here. Let me feel your back. Let me see.

1545
01:52:36,089 --> 01:52:38,008
Let me see. Hang on. I know.
I know it hurts.

1546
01:52:38,091 --> 01:52:40,177
You know how to take care of him, right?

1547
01:52:41,094 --> 01:52:42,387
Fuck, there's not an exit wound.

1548
01:52:42,471 --> 01:52:45,140
-We gotta get him to a hospital.
-We can't go to the hospital.

1549
01:52:45,224 --> 01:52:48,602
James, if we don't take him
to the fucking hospital, he's gonna die!

1550
01:52:48,685 --> 01:52:50,521
We can't go right now, man!
You're not listening to me!

1551
01:52:50,604 --> 01:52:51,855
They'll fucking arrest us!

1552
01:52:51,939 --> 01:52:54,983
We just robbed a fucking bank,
are you fucking crazy?

1553
01:52:55,067 --> 01:52:57,778
They've seen you plenty of fucking times!

1554
01:52:57,861 --> 01:53:00,489
So you need to think fucking straight
about this!

1555
01:53:00,572 --> 01:53:02,699
What do we do? What do we do?

1556
01:53:03,242 --> 01:53:05,744
Please just take me to the hospital, man.

1557
01:53:07,621 --> 01:53:09,665
-Take me to the hospital.
-I'm sorry.

1558
01:53:09,748 --> 01:53:10,749
I'm sorry, man.

1559
01:53:13,168 --> 01:53:14,169
Guys...

1560
01:53:14,253 --> 01:53:17,381
We can't. You know we can't.
You know we can't, right?

1561
01:53:17,464 --> 01:53:19,341
-Right?
-Guys...

1562
01:53:19,424 --> 01:53:20,509
What can we do?

1563
01:53:20,592 --> 01:53:22,261
What can we do?

1564
01:53:22,344 --> 01:53:23,637
Please, man.

1565
01:53:27,724 --> 01:53:28,934
I'm sorry.

1566
01:53:29,601 --> 01:53:31,395
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1567
01:53:38,443 --> 01:53:40,070
Just fucking drive, man.

1568
01:53:40,153 --> 01:53:41,864
Okay. Okay.

1569
01:53:41,947 --> 01:53:43,323
Just get us outta here.

1570
01:53:48,829 --> 01:53:50,581
This is so fucked up.

1571
01:53:56,211 --> 01:53:58,255
We never did find out how he got shot.

1572
01:54:00,799 --> 01:54:02,342
But it didn't matter.

1573
01:54:39,004 --> 01:54:40,172
Come on.

1574
01:54:41,215 --> 01:54:42,216
Come on.

1575
01:55:58,125 --> 01:55:59,501
What is he doing here?

1576
01:56:01,628 --> 01:56:03,297
-Go inside.
-What does he want?

1577
01:56:03,380 --> 01:56:04,673
Just go inside, baby.

1578
01:56:13,432 --> 01:56:15,726
If you're gonna shoot me,
can we go somewhere else?

1579
01:56:18,478 --> 01:56:19,563
You know...

1580
01:56:21,857 --> 01:56:23,025
for the neighbors.

1581
01:56:24,943 --> 01:56:26,778
I'm not gonna shoot you.

1582
01:56:30,741 --> 01:56:32,951
I won't get my money back...

1583
01:56:34,494 --> 01:56:35,787
if I shoot you.

1584
01:56:42,085 --> 01:56:43,545
I can't do this anymore.

1585
01:56:43,629 --> 01:56:46,048
-Sure you can.
-I can't.

1586
01:56:48,342 --> 01:56:49,426
You can.

1587
01:56:51,929 --> 01:56:55,349
For your girl... you can.

1588
01:57:04,816 --> 01:57:06,610
I just gotta get right first.

1589
01:57:41,436 --> 01:57:42,604
Hey, guess what.

1590
01:57:52,739 --> 01:57:56,368
Black is gonna drive for me
so I can pay him back.

1591
01:58:00,122 --> 01:58:01,498
Did he front you?

1592
01:58:07,629 --> 01:58:08,630
Yeah.

1593
01:58:14,178 --> 01:58:16,096
Can you make me a shot?

1594
01:58:19,057 --> 01:58:20,392
I'm just...

1595
01:58:23,228 --> 01:58:24,688
just really tired.

1596
01:58:26,481 --> 01:58:27,649
I know, baby.

1597
01:58:29,943 --> 01:58:32,404
-I want it to be quiet.
-I know.

1598
01:58:36,325 --> 01:58:38,702
Can you give me another shot?

1599
01:58:45,792 --> 01:58:47,753
Yeah, baby, when I'm back.

1600
01:58:53,467 --> 01:58:55,385
When I get back, baby.

1601
01:59:01,642 --> 01:59:02,809
I love you.

1602
01:59:06,647 --> 01:59:07,981
I love you too.

1603
01:59:40,472 --> 01:59:42,140
You know where you're going, right?

1604
01:59:42,224 --> 01:59:43,892
Make the first three lefts,
can't go wrong.

1605
01:59:43,976 --> 01:59:45,602
I'm not gonna be long,
two, three minutes, tops.

1606
01:59:45,686 --> 01:59:47,980
And don't be late.
I'll meet you in the parking lot.

1607
01:59:54,528 --> 01:59:58,532
Give me my fucking money, Vanessa!
Hurry the fuck up!

1608
01:59:58,615 --> 02:00:00,284
Slide it over! Now!

1609
02:00:22,848 --> 02:00:25,058
Vanessa, I need you to do me a favor.

1610
02:00:26,727 --> 02:00:27,895
What's that?

1611
02:00:29,313 --> 02:00:31,064
I need you to hit that alarm for me.

1612
02:00:35,611 --> 02:00:37,446
It's all right. I'm not gonna hurt you.

1613
02:00:51,293 --> 02:00:52,336
Thank you.

1614
02:01:33,752 --> 02:01:34,837
Here's your--

1615
02:09:47,704 --> 02:09:51,375
Therefore, it is our vote to grant parole.
Effective immediately.

1616
02:09:53,168 --> 02:09:56,338
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
My client is most appreciative.

1617
02:09:58,173 --> 02:09:59,299
Thank you.

1618
02:10:00,551 --> 02:10:01,760
Thank you so much.

1619
02:10:41,675 --> 02:10:42,926
Good luck.

1619
02:10:43,305 --> 02:11:43,477

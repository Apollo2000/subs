1
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,321
Ten-hut!

2
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:15,844
Be seated.

3
00:01:19,354 --> 00:01:21,481
Now, I want you to remember...

4
00:01:22,824 --> 00:01:26,692
...that no bastard ever won a war...

5
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,063
...by dying for his country.

6
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,566
He won it...

7
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:39,471
...by making the other poor dumb
bastard die for his country.

8
00:01:41,543 --> 00:01:42,976
Men...

9
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,873
...all this stuff you've heard
about America not wanting to fight...

10
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,242
...wanting to stay out of the war...

11
00:01:50,752 --> 00:01:52,743
...is a lot of horse dung.

12
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,382
Americans...

13
00:01:54,856 --> 00:01:57,256
...traditionally love to fight.

14
00:01:57,526 --> 00:02:02,759
All real Americans love
the sting of battle.

15
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,330
When you were kids...

16
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:10,895
...you all admired
the champion marble shooter...

17
00:02:11,106 --> 00:02:15,736
...the fastest runner, big-league
ball players, the toughest boxers.

18
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:18,845
Americans love a winner...

19
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:22,009
...and will not tolerate a loser.

20
00:02:22,384 --> 00:02:24,716
Americans play to win all the time.

21
00:02:24,953 --> 00:02:29,890
I wouldn't give a hoot in hell
for a man who lost and laughed.

22
00:02:30,725 --> 00:02:35,924
That's why Americans have never lost
and will never lose a war...

23
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:39,461
...because the very thought
of losing...

24
00:02:40,402 --> 00:02:43,030
...is hateful to Americans.

25
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,767
Now...

26
00:02:46,808 --> 00:02:50,107
...an army is a team.

27
00:02:50,812 --> 00:02:53,474
It lives, eats, sleeps,
fights as a team.

28
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,616
This individuality stuff
is a bunch of crap.

29
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,945
The bilious bastards who wrote
that stuff about individuality...

30
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,655
...for the <i>Saturday Evening Post...</i>

31
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:07,620
...don't know anything more about real
battle than they do about fornicating.

32
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:14,099
Now we have the finest food
and equipment...

33
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,466
...the best spirit...

34
00:03:17,672 --> 00:03:20,140
...and the best men in the world.

35
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,634
You know...

36
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:28,516
...by God, I actually pity those poor
bastards we're going up against.

37
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,944
By God, I do.

38
00:03:30,151 --> 00:03:33,086
We're not just going to shoot
the bastards...

39
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,523
...we're going to cut out
their living guts...

40
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:40,625
...and use them to grease
the treads of our tanks.

41
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:45,799
We're going to murder those lousy
Hun bastards by the bushel.

42
00:03:46,668 --> 00:03:47,862
Now...

43
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,001
...some of you boys...

44
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:53,500
...I know are wondering...

45
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:58,312
...whether or not you'll chicken out
under fire. Don't worry about it.

46
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:01,872
I can assure you...

47
00:04:02,317 --> 00:04:04,547
...that you will all do your duty.

48
00:04:06,054 --> 00:04:07,885
The Nazis...

49
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,381
...are the enemy.

50
00:04:10,692 --> 00:04:12,523
Wade into them!

51
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,158
Spill their blood!
Shoot them in the belly!

52
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,566
When you put your hand...

53
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:22,499
...into a bunch of goo...

54
00:04:22,737 --> 00:04:26,468
...that a moment before was
your best friend's face...

55
00:04:28,743 --> 00:04:30,404
...you'll know what to do.

56
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,248
There's another thing
I want you to remember.

57
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:41,684
I don't want to get any messages
saying we are "holding our position."

58
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,648
We're not "holding" anything.
Let the Hun do that.

59
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:50,491
We're advancing constantly. We're not
interested in holding onto anything...

60
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,530
...except the enemy.

61
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:56,498
We're going to hold on to him
by the nose and kick him in the ass.

62
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:59,001
We're going to kick the hell
out of him all the time...

63
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,937
...and we're going to go through him
like crap through a goose!

64
00:05:05,213 --> 00:05:06,510
Now...

65
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,081
...there's one thing...

66
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,451
...that you men will be able to say
when you get back home.

67
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:18,586
And you may thank God for it.

68
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:24,024
Thirty years from now when you're
sitting around your fireside...

69
00:05:24,232 --> 00:05:26,757
...with your grandson on your knee...

70
00:05:27,802 --> 00:05:29,269
...and he asks you:

71
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:33,029
"What did you do in the great
World War II?"

72
00:05:34,109 --> 00:05:36,134
You won't have to say:

73
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,274
"Well...

74
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,616
...I shoveled shit in Louisiana."

75
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,485
All right, now, you sons of bitches...

76
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,958
...you know how I feel.

77
00:05:56,998 --> 00:05:59,091
I will be proud...

78
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:04,298
...to lead you wonderful guys
into battle anytime...

79
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:07,440
...anywhere.

80
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:12,245
That's all.

81
00:11:05,273 --> 00:11:07,741
The Arabs need food and clothing.

82
00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:11,045
They strip our dead before
we can even bury them.

83
00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:14,145
Looks like the reports were
pretty accurate.

84
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:20,114
Sixty-one armored vehicles,
45 tons of ammunition...

85
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:25,257
...twenty-five 40mm guns,
three self-propelled 105s.

86
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:28,159
Not counting mortars, machine guns,
rifles...

87
00:11:28,463 --> 00:11:32,923
...pistols, telescopes, belt buckles,
GI socks.

88
00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:37,495
One thousand, eight hundred men.

89
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,358
Our people salute you, general...

90
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:40,692
...for your brilliant amphibious
landing on the continent of Africa...

91
00:12:40,902 --> 00:12:44,668
...and for your enlightened
administration of our country.

92
00:12:45,573 --> 00:12:47,165
I've enjoyed being here, Excellency.

93
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:50,900
Naturally, I'd prefer to be in Tunisia
fighting the Germans.

94
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:07,861
"The lions in their dens
tremble at his approach."

95
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,556
I appreciate that, Excellency.

96
00:14:13,995 --> 00:14:15,792
Magnificent!

97
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,925
I wish our troops looked that good.

98
00:14:51,132 --> 00:14:55,000
Tell me, general,
what do you think of Morocco?

99
00:14:55,202 --> 00:14:56,499
I love it, Excellency.

100
00:14:56,771 --> 00:15:01,299
It's a combination
of the Bible and Hollywood.

101
00:15:45,086 --> 00:15:48,180
- These men fight at Kasserine?
- Yes, sir.

102
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:50,983
For the American Army to take
a licking like that...

103
00:15:51,225 --> 00:15:53,819
...the first time at bat
against the Germans...

104
00:15:58,065 --> 00:16:00,898
Up against Rommel, what we need
is the best tank man we've got.

105
00:16:01,102 --> 00:16:03,434
Somebody tough enough
to pull this outfit together.

106
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:07,373
- Patton?
- Possibly.

107
00:16:08,275 --> 00:16:10,038
God help us.

108
00:18:03,157 --> 00:18:04,556
Lieutenant...

109
00:18:04,992 --> 00:18:07,051
...where is the duty officer?

110
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:13,460
- He said he's caught at shaving.
- Why isn't he here on duty?

111
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,629
Guess he needed a shave.

112
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:19,169
We got a new commanding general
due today.

113
00:18:44,098 --> 00:18:47,090
Who the hell is kicking me
in the butt?

114
00:18:50,538 --> 00:18:52,335
Oh, sorry, sir.

115
00:18:52,573 --> 00:18:56,942
- What were you doing down there?
- Trying to get some sleep, sir.

116
00:18:58,946 --> 00:18:59,935
Get back down there, son.

117
00:19:00,214 --> 00:19:03,411
You're the only son of a bitch here
who knows what he's trying to do.

118
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,242
Yes, sir.

119
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:12,752
- Brad, how the hell are you?
- Fine, George. Good to see you.

120
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,793
We were all under the impression
you wouldn't be here until 0900.

121
00:19:16,063 --> 00:19:17,963
Yes, I gathered that.

122
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:21,534
You know my boy, Dick Jenson.

123
00:19:21,936 --> 00:19:24,029
Brad, tell me.

124
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:27,872
- What are you doing here?
- Ike wanted a report on Kasserine.

125
00:19:28,108 --> 00:19:30,599
Meanwhile, I have to stay here
as an observer...

126
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,812
...but I report directly to Ike.

127
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,480
You're spying.

128
00:19:34,915 --> 00:19:37,383
Get me General Eisenhower's
headquarters.

129
00:19:38,652 --> 00:19:40,711
Tell me, Brad...

130
00:19:41,822 --> 00:19:44,620
...what happened at Kasserine?
I heard it was a shambles.

131
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,383
Apparently, everything went wrong.

132
00:19:48,295 --> 00:19:52,288
We'd send over a 75mm shell,
the krauts would return an 88.

133
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,659
Their tanks are diesels.

134
00:19:55,302 --> 00:19:59,500
Even when we managed to hit one
they kept on running. Our tanks...

135
00:20:00,941 --> 00:20:02,806
The men call them
"Purple Heart boxes."

136
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,671
One hot piece of shrapnel
and the gasoline explodes.

137
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,244
I warned them about the tank.

138
00:20:07,514 --> 00:20:10,142
I talked to one of the
soldiers about the half-tracks.

139
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:13,909
I asked them if the machine-gun
bullets pierced the armor.

140
00:20:14,154 --> 00:20:15,781
And he said, "No, sir.

141
00:20:16,023 --> 00:20:19,322
They just come through one side
and rattle around a bit."

142
00:20:20,194 --> 00:20:23,493
I understand they had a little trouble
coordinating the air cover.

143
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,163
The trouble was no air cover.

144
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,868
- General Smith on the line, sir.
- Excuse me, Brad.

145
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,007
Bedell?

146
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:40,542
Listen, I'm calling about Bradley
and his job here.

147
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:45,775
I need a good number-two man, I want
to make Brad my deputy commander.

148
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,884
You clear it with Ike?

149
00:20:50,024 --> 00:20:51,821
All right, thanks, Bedell.

150
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,459
Now you're not spying for Eisenhower
anymore, you're working for me.

151
00:20:56,163 --> 00:20:58,131
- Okay?
- Fine, okay.

152
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,829
Dick. You got those stars?

153
00:21:02,536 --> 00:21:04,731
- Yes, sir.
- Let's get them on.

154
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:20,045
What's the matter, Brad?
I've been nominated by the president.

155
00:21:20,587 --> 00:21:25,024
I know, but it doesn't become official
until it's approved by the Senate.

156
00:21:25,426 --> 00:21:26,893
Well...

157
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,224
...they have their schedule
and I have mine.

158
00:21:35,436 --> 00:21:36,596
George...

159
00:21:37,938 --> 00:21:41,032
...if you were named admiral
of the Turkish Navy...

160
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:43,436
...I believe your aides could dip
into their haversacks...

161
00:21:43,744 --> 00:21:45,837
...and come up with the appropriate
badge of rank.

162
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:50,850
Anyway, congratulations.
Premature congratulations.

163
00:21:52,086 --> 00:21:53,553
You know...

164
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:58,022
I think those stars look better
on a green shirt.

165
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:02,922
Did I ever tell you about the time I
designed a uniform for tank crewmen?

166
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:08,194
It was green leather,
it had red stripes...

167
00:22:08,435 --> 00:22:12,235
...and sort of a row of brass buttons
down across here.

168
00:22:12,473 --> 00:22:15,442
And topped off
by a gold football helmet.

169
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:19,038
The Army rejected it, of course.

170
00:22:19,246 --> 00:22:21,714
Goddamn, it was beautiful.

171
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:24,447
Lloyd Fredendall is just leaving.

172
00:22:58,485 --> 00:23:03,650
George, there's one other thing I put
in my Kasserine report.

173
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,787
Some of our boys
were just plain scared.

174
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,652
That's understandable.

175
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,659
Even the best foxhound is gun-shy
the first time out.

176
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,627
I can remember...

177
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:17,428
...when nothing frightened me
as much as the idea of...

178
00:23:17,671 --> 00:23:19,138
...a bullet coming
straight for my nose.

179
00:23:19,373 --> 00:23:23,469
I don't know why, but the image of a
bullet coming right for my nose...

180
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,007
...was more horrible
than any other possibility.

181
00:23:26,213 --> 00:23:29,705
Well, I can understand that,
with such a handsome nose.

182
00:23:31,852 --> 00:23:34,878
You want to know why this outfit
got the hell kicked out of it?

183
00:23:35,222 --> 00:23:37,213
Blind man could see it in a minute.

184
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,388
They don't look like soldiers.
They don't act like soldiers.

185
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,185
Why should they fight like soldiers?

186
00:23:42,496 --> 00:23:45,795
You're absolutely right.
The discipline's pretty poor.

187
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,796
In about 15 minutes we're going
to start turning these boys...

188
00:23:50,003 --> 00:23:52,631
...into fanatics, razors.

189
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,331
They'll lose their fear
of the Germans.

190
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,877
I hope to God they never lose
their fear of me.

191
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:22,232
Up bright and early, general?
Breakfast?

192
00:24:22,436 --> 00:24:24,563
Have all my officers
finished breakfast?

193
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,863
We're open from 6 till 8.

194
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,574
Most of the officers are
just coming in, sir.

195
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,277
Please inform these officers
the mess hall is closed.

196
00:24:33,046 --> 00:24:35,276
But, sir! It's only a quarter to 8.

197
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:40,213
From now on, you will open at 6
and no one will be admitted after 6:15.

198
00:24:40,454 --> 00:24:41,921
Where are your leggings?

199
00:24:42,122 --> 00:24:45,922
Leggings? Well, hell, general, sir,
I'm a cook.

200
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:49,188
You're a soldier.

201
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:51,189
$20 fine.

202
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:57,468
Gentlemen...

203
00:24:58,305 --> 00:25:00,432
...from this moment any man...

204
00:25:00,641 --> 00:25:03,769
...without leggings, without a helmet,
without a tie...

205
00:25:04,444 --> 00:25:07,880
Any man with unshined shoes
or soiled uniform...

206
00:25:10,117 --> 00:25:11,709
...is going to be skinned.

207
00:25:51,658 --> 00:25:55,651
This is a barracks.
It's not a bordello.

208
00:26:23,523 --> 00:26:25,548
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

209
00:26:26,393 --> 00:26:27,451
Doctor.

210
00:26:27,694 --> 00:26:28,718
Sir.

211
00:26:28,996 --> 00:26:33,228
I understand you have two cases
of self-inflicted wounds.

212
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,797
Yes, sir, we do.

213
00:26:35,035 --> 00:26:36,559
Get them out of here.

214
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,169
One has developed a serious infection.

215
00:26:39,406 --> 00:26:42,637
I don't care if he dies,
just get him out of here.

216
00:26:42,876 --> 00:26:46,209
Doesn't belong in the same room
with men wounded in battle.

217
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,344
- I'll see that they're moved.
- One more thing.

218
00:26:49,683 --> 00:26:52,880
There'll be no "battle fatigue."
That's an order.

219
00:26:53,553 --> 00:26:56,420
Battle fatigue is a free ride
to the hospital.

220
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,749
I'm not going to subsidize cowardice.

221
00:26:59,026 --> 00:27:00,186
Yes, sir.

222
00:27:00,394 --> 00:27:03,727
Doctor...
Where's your helmet?

223
00:27:05,198 --> 00:27:07,689
I don't wear a helmet
in the hospital.

224
00:27:08,568 --> 00:27:09,830
Start.

225
00:27:10,103 --> 00:27:13,072
I can't use my stethoscope
when I'm wearing my helmet.

226
00:27:15,776 --> 00:27:17,073
Well...

227
00:27:18,712 --> 00:27:22,079
...then cut two holes in your helmet
so that you can.

228
00:27:22,616 --> 00:27:25,779
And get those yellow-bellies
out of here, today.

229
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,623
Hold it.

230
00:27:36,463 --> 00:27:37,760
Turn right, here.

231
00:27:38,065 --> 00:27:40,056
The battlefield is ahead.

232
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:42,462
Don't argue.
I can smell a battlefield.

233
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:44,396
He was out here yesterday.

234
00:27:44,638 --> 00:27:47,368
It's over there. Turn right, damn it.

235
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,341
It was here.

236
00:28:34,521 --> 00:28:36,318
The battlefield was here.

237
00:28:45,365 --> 00:28:48,425
The Carthaginians
defending the city...

238
00:28:48,668 --> 00:28:52,001
...were attacked by three
Roman legions.

239
00:28:53,807 --> 00:28:58,005
They were brave, but they
couldn't hold. They were massacred.

240
00:29:00,514 --> 00:29:02,175
Arab women...

241
00:29:02,883 --> 00:29:06,819
...stripped them of their tunics
and their swords and lances.

242
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,389
The soldiers lay naked in the sun...

243
00:29:13,894 --> 00:29:15,725
...2000 years ago.

244
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:21,794
I was here.

245
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,473
You don't believe me.

246
00:29:32,045 --> 00:29:33,876
You know what the poet said:

247
00:29:35,182 --> 00:29:37,412
"Through the travail of ages

248
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:42,250
Midst the pomp and toils of war

249
00:29:42,722 --> 00:29:47,216
Have I fought and strove and perished

250
00:29:47,727 --> 00:29:50,355
Countless times upon the star

251
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:58,069
As if through a glass and darkly

252
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,834
The age-old strife I see

253
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:06,008
Where I fought in many guises
Many names

254
00:30:07,714 --> 00:30:09,341
But always me."

255
00:30:16,289 --> 00:30:18,280
You know who the poet was?

256
00:30:21,094 --> 00:30:22,254
Me.

257
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,589
There's an opportunity
for us to mount an offensive.

258
00:32:34,861 --> 00:32:36,886
We've concentrated on the flank...

259
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,063
...draw strength from the British.

260
00:32:39,265 --> 00:32:41,563
It appears now that we could...

261
00:32:41,768 --> 00:32:43,736
...split the African corridor.

262
00:32:43,937 --> 00:32:45,404
Drive through Rommel to the sea.

263
00:32:45,705 --> 00:32:48,697
I'm sorry, but that territory
has been reserved...

264
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,203
...for General Bernard Law Montgomery.

265
00:32:51,444 --> 00:32:54,345
We're supposed to let him win this one
no matter what.

266
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:57,072
They're entitled to have their hero.

267
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,547
Montgomery did push Rommel
clear across North Africa.

268
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,048
What about the Americans?
Don't they need a hero too?

269
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:06,687
You have anybody in mind?

270
00:33:08,928 --> 00:33:12,227
Air Vice-Marshal Coningham
is here with General Buford.

271
00:33:12,465 --> 00:33:13,898
Excuse me, gentlemen...

272
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:19,128
...while I ask our British friends
what's happened to our air cover.

273
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,863
Harry.

274
00:33:22,108 --> 00:33:23,370
How are you?

275
00:33:23,576 --> 00:33:25,771
George. Good to see you.

276
00:33:27,313 --> 00:33:29,781
- You know Arthur Coningham.
- Sir Arthur.

277
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,539
Delighted to see you.

278
00:33:32,752 --> 00:33:34,743
I've heard so much about you.

279
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:44,326
Gentlemen, it appears there's been a
slight misunderstanding here...

280
00:33:44,597 --> 00:33:46,656
...and Ike thought we should fix it.

281
00:33:46,966 --> 00:33:48,957
No, no. No misunderstanding.

282
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:52,068
We're supposed to have allied
air cover and we don't.

283
00:33:52,338 --> 00:33:55,000
German planes are strafing my troops.

284
00:33:55,275 --> 00:33:59,439
If I may say so, general, I'm afraid
your operation reports are inaccurate.

285
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:03,307
Report? Three days ago, the crowds
took off after my command car...

286
00:34:03,516 --> 00:34:05,279
...ran my ass into a ditch.

287
00:34:05,485 --> 00:34:08,648
My staff has assured me,
we have complete air supremacy...

288
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:10,617
...everywhere in the Mediterranean.

289
00:34:10,824 --> 00:34:12,917
When I complained about air cover...

290
00:34:13,193 --> 00:34:15,957
...you said our troops
were not battleworthy.

291
00:34:16,196 --> 00:34:21,031
You spoke of the discredited practice
of using air force as an alibi...

292
00:34:21,301 --> 00:34:24,202
...for lack of success on the ground.

293
00:34:24,471 --> 00:34:28,168
I have to wet-nurse Montgomery,
I don't have to stand for that.

294
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:32,036
I sincerely apologize for that remark,
whoever made it.

295
00:34:33,313 --> 00:34:35,838
And I promise you one thing, general:

296
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:38,381
You will see no more German planes.

297
00:34:50,497 --> 00:34:53,728
We were discussing air supremacy,
Sir Arthur.

298
00:35:27,066 --> 00:35:28,328
Damn door won't open!

299
00:35:42,115 --> 00:35:44,345
By God, that's enough!

300
00:36:03,403 --> 00:36:05,530
Get that thing out of here!

301
00:36:06,439 --> 00:36:09,772
Come on, you bastards,
take a shot at me on the nose!

302
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:14,480
Get back in here, George! We need
a corps commander, not a casualty.

303
00:36:41,307 --> 00:36:43,172
How'd you manage to stage that?

304
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,602
I don't know...

305
00:36:45,845 --> 00:36:48,905
...but if I could find
the Nazis flying those things...

306
00:36:49,115 --> 00:36:51,174
...I'd give them each a medal.

307
00:37:12,138 --> 00:37:15,164
Can't get over how cold
it gets in the desert.

308
00:37:15,842 --> 00:37:17,673
Awfully cold, sir.

309
00:37:48,374 --> 00:37:51,309
Rommel's out there somewhere,
waiting for me.

310
00:37:54,247 --> 00:37:55,646
You know...

311
00:37:56,749 --> 00:38:01,049
...if I had my way, I'd send
that genius son of a bitch...

312
00:38:01,521 --> 00:38:05,013
...an engraved invitation
in iambic pentameter:

313
00:38:05,591 --> 00:38:09,083
A challenge in two stanzas
to meet me alone in the desert.

314
00:38:09,762 --> 00:38:11,252
I'll deliver it.

315
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,530
Rommel in his tank and me in mine.

316
00:38:18,604 --> 00:38:22,096
We'd stop about 20 paces.
We'd get out, we'd shake hands...

317
00:38:22,942 --> 00:38:26,070
...then we'd button up and do battle,
just the two of us.

318
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:30,440
That battle would decide
the outcome of the war.

319
00:38:31,384 --> 00:38:34,410
It's too bad jousting's
gone out of style.

320
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,386
It's like your poetry, general.

321
00:38:37,623 --> 00:38:40,285
It isn't part of the 20th century.

322
00:38:41,094 --> 00:38:42,959
You're right, Dick.

323
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,521
The world grew up.

324
00:38:47,633 --> 00:38:49,225
Hell of a shame.

325
00:38:51,938 --> 00:38:55,101
Dick, I want a 24-hour guard
put around this area.

326
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,605
If we don't, the Arabs will dig
them up for their clothes.

327
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:04,081
Our graves aren't gonna disappear
like everybody else's who fought here.

328
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:08,816
The Greeks, Romans, Carthaginians.

329
00:39:11,457 --> 00:39:14,051
God, how I hate the 20th century.

330
00:41:39,472 --> 00:41:40,700
General.

331
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,402
General?

332
00:41:43,943 --> 00:41:46,138
We intercepted a German radio message.

333
00:41:46,412 --> 00:41:50,246
Rommel's 10th Panzer is going
to hit us near Al Guettar.

334
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,951
Rommel, huh?

335
00:43:48,734 --> 00:43:50,361
All my life...

336
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:55,568
...I've wanted to lead a lot of men
in a desperate battle.

337
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:04,380
Now I'm going to do it.

338
00:44:15,561 --> 00:44:16,619
Look.

339
00:44:51,931 --> 00:44:53,558
Battalion strength at least.

340
00:46:16,515 --> 00:46:19,075
They haven't spotted our positions yet.

341
00:46:19,718 --> 00:46:23,154
They'll get an education
in about 10 seconds.

342
00:46:23,389 --> 00:46:26,085
Wait till they get a dose of
that artillery fire.

343
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,368
Commence firing.
Fire at will.

344
00:46:45,277 --> 00:46:49,509
Commence firing. Fire at will.
Commence firing. Fire at will.

345
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:52,169
What a hell of a waste
of fine infantry.

346
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,753
- Get General Bradley on the radio.
- Yes, sir.

347
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,145
Sir, I can't raise him.

348
00:48:33,352 --> 00:48:36,879
Go tell him to hit them hard. Here's
where we hold them by the nose...

349
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,987
...and kick them in the ass.
Go on.

350
00:49:54,233 --> 00:49:55,962
Put him in my car.

351
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,479
Rommel...

352
00:51:52,885 --> 00:51:56,651
...you magnificent bastard.
I read your book!

353
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:24,947
<i>Captain Richard N. Jenson</i>
<i>was a fine boy.</i>

354
00:52:25,384 --> 00:52:28,945
<i>Loyal, unselfish and efficient.</i>

355
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,420
<i>I am terribly sorry.</i>

356
00:52:43,569 --> 00:52:46,936
<i>There are no coffins here</i>
<i>since there is no wood.</i>

357
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:50,641
<i>We will have a trumpeter</i>
<i>and an honor guard...</i>

358
00:52:50,943 --> 00:52:55,243
<i>... but we will not fire the volleys as</i>
<i>people would think an air raid was on.</i>

359
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:15,890
<i>I enclosed a lock of Dick's hair</i>
<i>in a letter to his mother.</i>

360
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,662
<i>He was a fine man...</i>

361
00:53:20,472 --> 00:53:21,962
<i>... and a fine officer.</i>

362
00:53:22,808 --> 00:53:25,072
<i>And he had no vices.</i>

363
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,686
<i>I shall miss him a lot.</i>

364
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:50,095
<i>I can't see the reason</i>
<i>such fine young men get killed.</i>

365
00:53:51,536 --> 00:53:54,266
<i>There are so many battles</i>
<i>yet to fight.</i>

366
00:54:09,221 --> 00:54:12,713
<i>Battle-weary, but victorious,</i>
<i>American Gls and Tommies...</i>

367
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:16,449
<i>... of the British 8th Army meet in</i>
<i>an Allied victory celebration...</i>

368
00:54:16,695 --> 00:54:19,289
<i>... at Wadi Akarit in North Africa.</i>

369
00:54:19,531 --> 00:54:23,865
<i>For the first time in this war,</i>
<i>Broadway and Piccadilly join hands.</i>

370
00:54:28,006 --> 00:54:30,975
<i>Meanwhile, General Montgomery,</i>
<i>hero of El Alamein...</i>

371
00:54:31,176 --> 00:54:34,077
<i>... continues to lead his</i>
<i>victorious British 8th Army...</i>

372
00:54:34,379 --> 00:54:38,509
<i>... in a relentless drive against</i>
<i>Rommel's vaunted Africa corps.</i>

373
00:56:41,225 --> 00:56:44,558
General Bradley's done
a tremendous job with 2nd Corps.

374
00:56:44,795 --> 00:56:48,060
He's moved into Bizerte
and taken over 41,000 prisoners.

375
00:56:48,299 --> 00:56:49,766
Good. Very good.

376
00:56:50,034 --> 00:56:54,528
You're not surprised, are you?
After all, you trained that outfit.

377
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:00,868
Excuse me, general.

378
00:57:01,145 --> 00:57:05,775
This is interesting. We've discovered
Rommel wasn't present at El Guettar.

379
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:08,744
- Who says so?
- G2, sir.

380
00:57:10,488 --> 00:57:14,322
When we took 10th Panzer,
Rommel was in Berlin with an earache?

381
00:57:14,558 --> 00:57:16,719
Severe nasal diphtheria, sir.

382
00:57:16,961 --> 00:57:19,657
Also, Hitler probably
retained Rommel in Berlin...

383
00:57:19,931 --> 00:57:22,263
...because things were going badly
for the Africa Corps.

384
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,230
He didn't want his favorite general
to lose face.

385
00:57:25,436 --> 00:57:27,961
I'm my favorite general,
and I don't like to be told...

386
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:31,834
...that some second-stringer
is up against me. Then I lose face.

387
00:57:39,417 --> 00:57:41,248
Who the hell are you, anyway?

388
00:57:41,619 --> 00:57:44,986
General, this is Lieutenant
Colonel Codman. Your new aide.

389
00:57:45,256 --> 00:57:48,953
Codman. I pulled your name off
the list because I know your family.

390
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,318
I'm glad you did, sir.

391
00:57:50,628 --> 00:57:54,257
Rommel is the best the krauts have,
and I kicked the hell out of him.

392
00:57:54,532 --> 00:57:57,433
Now my own G2 section is telling
me he wasn't even there.

393
00:57:57,668 --> 00:58:01,934
But, general, he undoubtedly
planned the German battle.

394
00:58:02,506 --> 00:58:07,307
If you defeat Rommel's plan, you've
defeated Rommel. Isn't that true?

395
00:58:08,779 --> 00:58:10,007
Codman...

396
00:58:12,149 --> 00:58:14,811
- Have a drink with me tonight.
- Yes, sir.

397
00:58:15,019 --> 00:58:17,954
I have a plan
for the invasion of Sicily.

398
00:58:18,189 --> 00:58:22,125
I want to make sure I get it approved.
You can help me.

399
00:58:22,326 --> 00:58:24,988
I want to give a dinner
for General Alexander.

400
00:58:25,196 --> 00:58:26,686
Get to him before Montgomery does.

401
00:58:26,964 --> 00:58:32,231
This will be strictly a formal affair,
Codman, but purely social.

402
00:58:32,536 --> 00:58:34,003
By that I mean...

403
00:58:34,205 --> 00:58:36,366
...purely political.
- Yes, sir.

404
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,473
I want the finest food, the best wine
available. Everything, <i>comme il faut.</i>

405
00:59:09,073 --> 00:59:10,734
Thank you.

406
00:59:11,375 --> 00:59:14,208
George, this is really splendid wine.

407
00:59:14,412 --> 00:59:15,709
Thank you, Arthur.

408
00:59:18,783 --> 00:59:20,114
Thank you.

409
00:59:22,386 --> 00:59:26,755
Sir Harold, I think it was Alcibiades
in the Peloponnesian War...

410
00:59:26,957 --> 00:59:28,618
...415 B.C.

411
00:59:28,859 --> 00:59:32,795
He said, "If Syracuse falls, all
Sicily falls, and then Italy."

412
00:59:33,064 --> 00:59:36,591
He knew that Syracuse was the
jugular of the island.

413
00:59:36,867 --> 00:59:39,597
Old Alcibiades always went
for the throat.

414
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:41,963
I propose to take Sicily
in the same way.

415
00:59:42,206 --> 00:59:45,369
- How's it going?
- The old man has them in his pocket.

416
00:59:49,046 --> 00:59:50,877
Now, according to my plan...

417
00:59:51,082 --> 00:59:54,108
...General Montgomery will land here.

418
00:59:55,386 --> 00:59:57,786
I'll hit the beaches here,
take Palermo.

419
00:59:58,055 --> 01:00:01,456
Monty will drive north on the coast,
I'll come due east...

420
01:00:01,725 --> 01:00:04,387
...take Messina and cut off
the German escape route.

421
01:00:06,564 --> 01:00:08,794
It looks like an interesting plan.

422
01:00:08,999 --> 01:00:12,457
Well, gentlemen,
to the conquest of Sicily.

423
01:00:13,404 --> 01:00:14,462
To the conquest of Sicily.

424
01:00:15,139 --> 01:00:16,766
To Sicily!

425
01:00:17,608 --> 01:00:20,839
George, you'd have made a great
marshal for Napoleon...

426
01:00:21,112 --> 01:00:22,807
...if you'd lived in the 18th century.

427
01:00:23,114 --> 01:00:26,413
But I did, sir. I did.

428
01:01:02,953 --> 01:01:04,978
Morning. Is General Smith in?

429
01:01:05,222 --> 01:01:08,316
- I believe he's in the lavatory, sir.
- Thank you.

430
01:01:15,533 --> 01:01:18,195
- Ah, there you are, Bedell.
- Monty.

431
01:01:18,469 --> 01:01:22,371
Bedell, I've been giving a good bit of
thought to the Sicily operation.

432
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,732
Yes?

433
01:01:24,708 --> 01:01:26,266
I assume we're alone.

434
01:01:26,477 --> 01:01:29,878
Georgie Patton has already
discussed his plan with Alexander.

435
01:01:30,147 --> 01:01:31,239
I realize that...

436
01:01:31,549 --> 01:01:36,043
...but I have an idea that his plan
may lead to an absolute disaster.

437
01:01:40,724 --> 01:01:41,748
Bedell, look.

438
01:01:41,992 --> 01:01:44,256
This is Sicily.

439
01:01:45,062 --> 01:01:47,929
Now then, according to Patton's plan...

440
01:01:48,199 --> 01:01:50,667
...I will attack Syracuse here.

441
01:01:50,868 --> 01:01:53,393
And he would attack Palermo up here.

442
01:01:53,604 --> 01:01:55,936
Now, obviously our forces would be
divided.

443
01:01:56,207 --> 01:01:58,903
And obviously, they
could be chopped up piecemeal.

444
01:01:59,176 --> 01:02:03,806
Now then, what I propose, and what
I shall insist on, by the way...

445
01:02:04,014 --> 01:02:05,276
...is this.

446
01:02:07,384 --> 01:02:10,285
I will land at Syracuse as planned.

447
01:02:10,521 --> 01:02:14,218
But the Americans...
The Americans will land here, at Gela.

448
01:02:14,425 --> 01:02:19,488
I will advance north to Messina,
the Americans protecting my flank.

449
01:02:19,697 --> 01:02:22,632
After all, Messina is the key.

450
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,528
It's the reason for invading Sicily.

451
01:02:26,637 --> 01:02:29,231
I'll discuss your plan with Ike.

452
01:02:30,207 --> 01:02:33,040
I'm sure he'll give it
serious consideration.

453
01:02:38,249 --> 01:02:39,580
- Amusing, isn't it?
- What?

454
01:02:39,817 --> 01:02:41,546
That the plans for the
invasion of Sicily...

455
01:02:41,785 --> 01:02:44,618
...should have been put forward
in an Algerian lavatory.

456
01:02:45,089 --> 01:02:48,422
George, I have bad news for you
about your Sicily plan.

457
01:02:48,659 --> 01:02:50,718
Ike has turned it down.

458
01:02:51,095 --> 01:02:55,498
Since the Italians will be defending
their native soil for the first time...

459
01:02:55,733 --> 01:03:00,295
...and the German resistance is
stiffening, we shouldn't be divided.

460
01:03:01,138 --> 01:03:05,074
- Well, where do my people land then?
- In the Gulf of Gela.

461
01:03:05,276 --> 01:03:06,903
There's nothing there
but a beach.

462
01:03:07,144 --> 01:03:11,137
Yes, but it puts you in a good
position to support Montgomery.

463
01:03:12,249 --> 01:03:13,944
Where does Montgomery land?

464
01:03:14,184 --> 01:03:18,450
He'll land in Syracuse and drive north
to Catania. Possibly even Messina.

465
01:03:18,922 --> 01:03:21,982
And you'll be alongside,
protecting his left.

466
01:03:22,493 --> 01:03:23,653
I see.

467
01:03:25,596 --> 01:03:29,999
In other words, we get the burden again
while good old Monty gets the glory.

468
01:03:30,301 --> 01:03:33,031
Ike had to consider all points of view.

469
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:36,603
He made his decision not as an
American, but as an Ally.

470
01:03:37,608 --> 01:03:40,975
Had it been the other way around,
I assure you, Monty would protest.

471
01:03:42,313 --> 01:03:43,473
No...

472
01:03:45,015 --> 01:03:47,210
...I've been in the Army 30 years.

473
01:03:47,618 --> 01:03:52,021
When I get an order, I say, "Yes, sir."
And I do my best to carry it out.

474
01:03:56,126 --> 01:04:00,222
This is what happens when your
commander stops being an American...

475
01:04:00,664 --> 01:04:02,655
...and starts being an Ally.

476
01:05:13,737 --> 01:05:15,967
I don't think I've made
myself clear, sir.

477
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:19,835
It's true, Montgomery met the
toughest resistance there at Catania.

478
01:05:20,043 --> 01:05:21,032
However, if we're...

479
01:05:21,245 --> 01:05:22,644
Perfectly clear.

480
01:05:22,946 --> 01:05:26,973
Old Monty is as stuck
as a bug on flypaper.

481
01:05:27,785 --> 01:05:29,912
But this order from
General Alexander...

482
01:05:30,154 --> 01:05:33,988
...directing you to turn over the
Vizzini-Caltagirone road to Montgomery.

483
01:05:34,625 --> 01:05:37,753
Well, then, old Bradley will have to
slug... slug, mind you...

484
01:05:37,961 --> 01:05:42,762
...his way up center of the island over
those tough mountain roads, won't he?

485
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,228
Yes, sir.

486
01:05:44,635 --> 01:05:46,500
Messina, Bell.

487
01:05:47,104 --> 01:05:48,128
Messina...

488
01:05:49,239 --> 01:05:52,265
...is the heart of it. If they'd
followed my plan, I'd be there by now.

489
01:05:52,476 --> 01:05:55,912
I'd cut off the retreat of every
German on this island!

490
01:05:56,947 --> 01:05:58,915
Now, you know what I'm gonna do?

491
01:05:59,149 --> 01:06:00,514
I'm gonna go to Palermo.

492
01:06:00,751 --> 01:06:04,710
I'm gonna beat that limey at Messina
if it's the last thing I ever do!

493
01:06:04,922 --> 01:06:09,450
Hey, what's all this talk about taking
the Vizzini road away from 2nd Corps?

494
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:15,697
General Alexander's orders.
Road goes to Montgomery.

495
01:06:15,966 --> 01:06:18,628
Now, that road was assigned to me.

496
01:06:19,436 --> 01:06:22,166
How can I get north without it?
You know the terrain there.

497
01:06:22,439 --> 01:06:26,603
I'm sorry, Brad. But Monty's run
into tough opposition. Very tough.

498
01:06:29,046 --> 01:06:32,709
You wouldn't be taking advantage of
this situation, would you?

499
01:06:33,016 --> 01:06:34,483
I don't know what you're talking about.

500
01:06:34,718 --> 01:06:37,881
Without that road, your army,
except for my 2nd Corps...

501
01:06:38,121 --> 01:06:39,486
...would be out of a job.

502
01:06:40,023 --> 01:06:42,116
Free for you to go into Palermo.

503
01:06:42,392 --> 01:06:44,485
Who said anything about Palermo?

504
01:06:45,963 --> 01:06:47,828
I can read a map.

505
01:06:48,866 --> 01:06:51,357
Does Alexander know
you've pushed out this far?

506
01:06:51,635 --> 01:06:54,297
That's a reconnaissance in force.

507
01:06:57,241 --> 01:06:58,469
George...

508
01:07:00,377 --> 01:07:02,709
...are you saying I've got to slug
it out in those mountains...

509
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:05,175
...with heavy resistance?

510
01:07:05,682 --> 01:07:08,674
Just so you can make
a bigger splash than Monty?

511
01:07:09,319 --> 01:07:10,547
General...

512
01:07:11,488 --> 01:07:13,581
...I just follow my orders.

513
01:07:13,857 --> 01:07:16,417
Like the simple old soldier I am.

514
01:07:17,361 --> 01:07:18,885
General Bradley.

515
01:07:19,997 --> 01:07:23,057
Sir, General Alexander has heard
we're moving west.

516
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:27,667
He says here, "Stop immediately.
Go no farther than Agrigento.

517
01:07:27,905 --> 01:07:30,772
Repeat. Stop, immediately."

518
01:07:31,542 --> 01:07:33,703
That's what you think it says.

519
01:07:34,077 --> 01:07:37,046
I think it was garbled
in transmission.

520
01:07:37,281 --> 01:07:39,841
Ask them to re-transmit the message.

521
01:07:40,083 --> 01:07:42,244
That'll take half a day at least.

522
01:07:42,519 --> 01:07:43,543
Yes, sir.

523
01:07:47,858 --> 01:07:49,348
Now, Brad.

524
01:07:52,095 --> 01:07:53,528
Where were we?

525
01:07:55,399 --> 01:07:58,095
We were talking about a simple...

526
01:07:58,302 --> 01:07:59,963
...old soldier.

527
01:08:30,467 --> 01:08:31,900
Look at that, gentlemen.

528
01:08:34,237 --> 01:08:36,068
Compared to war...

529
01:08:36,506 --> 01:08:39,839
...all other forms of human endeavor
shrink to insignificance.

530
01:08:40,644 --> 01:08:42,942
Let's go, sergeant.
Move out!

531
01:09:32,629 --> 01:09:34,654
Give me that helmet.

532
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:39,029
Come on, let's get out of here!

533
01:09:51,348 --> 01:09:53,646
What silly son of a bitch
is in charge of this operation?

534
01:09:53,917 --> 01:09:56,545
I don't know, but they
ought to hang him.

535
01:10:10,267 --> 01:10:12,929
These men are here from the States,
looking over our program...

536
01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:14,899
...for the spiritual welfare
of the men.

537
01:10:15,105 --> 01:10:16,868
We'll take you right into Palermo.

538
01:10:17,107 --> 01:10:19,268
Col. David toured us around
your quarters...

539
01:10:19,543 --> 01:10:24,242
...and I saw a Bible by your bed.
Do you actually find time to read it?

540
01:10:24,948 --> 01:10:26,279
I sure do.

541
01:10:26,583 --> 01:10:28,448
Every goddamn day.

542
01:10:51,441 --> 01:10:53,909
Sir, Patton's taken Palermo!

543
01:10:55,078 --> 01:10:55,908
Damn!

544
01:11:14,264 --> 01:11:16,960
Palermo's the most conquered city
in history.

545
01:11:17,234 --> 01:11:19,134
First the Phoenicians...

546
01:11:19,603 --> 01:11:23,095
...the Romans,
Carthaginians, Byzantines.

547
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:25,103
Then came the Arabs...

548
01:11:25,342 --> 01:11:27,902
...Spaniards, Neapolitans.

549
01:11:28,111 --> 01:11:29,578
Now comes...

550
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:31,645
...the American Army.

551
01:11:41,825 --> 01:11:43,816
This is from General Alexander, sir...

552
01:11:44,094 --> 01:11:47,291
...reminding you that you are
not to take Palermo.

553
01:11:47,864 --> 01:11:49,991
Send him a message, Cod.

554
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:52,530
Ask him if he
wants me to give it back.

555
01:12:39,015 --> 01:12:40,710
Let me ask you a question
for a change.

556
01:12:40,984 --> 01:12:42,884
You've just come from Washington.

557
01:12:43,186 --> 01:12:45,586
How do they feel about our boys
taking Palermo?

558
01:12:45,856 --> 01:12:50,088
The general impression is, your army
barreled through token resistance...

559
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,692
...while Montgomery faced the brunt
of the fighting.

560
01:12:52,929 --> 01:12:55,693
Don't they know we took on
the Hermann Gצring division?

561
01:12:55,932 --> 01:12:57,399
Toughest outfit in the German Army.

562
01:12:57,667 --> 01:12:59,692
The people at home
are interested in you.

563
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:02,167
They're curious about your
pearl-handle revolvers.

564
01:13:02,372 --> 01:13:05,500
They're ivory. Only a pimp
from a New Orleans whorehouse...

565
01:13:05,742 --> 01:13:07,369
...would carry a pearl handle.

566
01:13:07,577 --> 01:13:09,238
What about your language?

567
01:13:09,512 --> 01:13:12,572
When I want it to stick,
I give it to them loud and dirty.

568
01:13:12,849 --> 01:13:14,680
What do your troops feel about that?

569
01:13:14,918 --> 01:13:18,285
I don't want these men to love me.
I want them to fight for me.

570
01:13:18,622 --> 01:13:22,786
Ernie Pyle says you have a secret
weapon here: General Bradley.

571
01:13:23,026 --> 01:13:24,891
Ernie calls him "The GI General."

572
01:13:25,095 --> 01:13:28,223
Omar Bradley is no secret.
He's a damn fine commander.

573
01:13:28,465 --> 01:13:30,763
What's your feeling about Montgomery?

574
01:13:31,034 --> 01:13:33,195
He's the best general the English have.

575
01:13:33,403 --> 01:13:36,964
He seems more concerned with not
losing than he does about winning.

576
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:40,368
He's not aggressive enough,
is that correct?

577
01:13:40,877 --> 01:13:43,641
Look, I've been getting into
a lot of trouble lately.

578
01:13:43,914 --> 01:13:46,883
Yesterday, the office told me
that my Italian prisoners...

579
01:13:47,117 --> 01:13:48,914
...didn't have enough latrine.

580
01:13:49,552 --> 01:13:52,544
They didn't know what a
latrine was till I showed them.

581
01:13:52,822 --> 01:13:56,155
If I've said anything too critical
of my British colleague...

582
01:13:56,393 --> 01:13:57,724
...let's forget about it.

583
01:13:57,961 --> 01:14:00,953
I will tell you one thing, though.
Off the record.

584
01:14:01,765 --> 01:14:03,460
I'm gonna beat that...

585
01:14:03,667 --> 01:14:05,567
...gentleman to Messina.

586
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:17,246
Ah, Freddie. Do you realize what
this madman Patton is saying?

587
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,744
He's going to save our skins
by taking Messina.

588
01:14:19,983 --> 01:14:22,008
This report might interest you.

589
01:14:22,285 --> 01:14:25,846
Here I am in these bloody marshes,
fighting malaria and Germans...

590
01:14:26,156 --> 01:14:29,489
...while he's taking Palermo
and getting all the glory.

591
01:14:31,294 --> 01:14:32,454
Well!

592
01:14:32,662 --> 01:14:36,428
Now he's up against three good
German divisions and he's stuck.

593
01:14:36,666 --> 01:14:38,429
He's not going to get Messina.

594
01:14:38,668 --> 01:14:42,001
That's reserved for the
British 8th Army and me.

595
01:14:48,611 --> 01:14:52,877
It's time for a move, Lucian. Terry
Allen's 1st Division is bogged down.

596
01:14:53,149 --> 01:14:54,776
You're bogged down too.

597
01:14:55,018 --> 01:14:58,317
What we need is another end run
just to break things loose.

598
01:14:59,823 --> 01:15:02,883
- Lucian. How's my fighter?
- Fine, George.

599
01:15:03,226 --> 01:15:07,492
Come in, come in. We need another
one of your amphibious specialties.

600
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:14,864
Lucian, I want you to send a
reinforced battalion by sea...

601
01:15:15,138 --> 01:15:18,539
...to make a landing up here at Brolo
behind the kraut lines.

602
01:15:18,808 --> 01:15:21,174
You want me to do a land-based attack.

603
01:15:21,411 --> 01:15:24,710
Right. I want a coordinated
attack the morning of the 11 th.

604
01:15:24,981 --> 01:15:27,176
I don't think we can make it
by the 11 th.

605
01:15:27,417 --> 01:15:32,320
- Hell, it's only 15, 20 miles.
- My boys have been dying for yards.

606
01:15:34,991 --> 01:15:37,858
Maybe you better kick a few butts
if you have to.

607
01:15:38,895 --> 01:15:41,830
I recommended you for your DSM
in your last promotion.

608
01:15:42,032 --> 01:15:44,557
I know what you can do when
you put your mind to it.

609
01:15:45,101 --> 01:15:46,830
Excuse me, sir.

610
01:15:48,104 --> 01:15:51,198
I'm sorry, but I can't
do the impossible.

611
01:15:52,442 --> 01:15:56,208
You're too old an athlete to think
you can postpone a scheduled match.

612
01:15:56,413 --> 01:16:00,008
You're an old athlete yourself.
You know matches are postponed.

613
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:04,550
If we can't back Lucian up by land,
our end run could be a disaster.

614
01:16:04,754 --> 01:16:08,713
Those men might get caught
on the beach and cut to pieces.

615
01:16:08,925 --> 01:16:11,519
- What's the matter?
- All we're saying is...

616
01:16:11,728 --> 01:16:14,390
...not to rush in until we're ready.

617
01:16:14,631 --> 01:16:16,428
Give him an extra day.

618
01:16:16,633 --> 01:16:18,066
Just one more day.

619
01:16:18,435 --> 01:16:20,403
The landing is on.

620
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:22,064
We're going to Messina.

621
01:16:22,439 --> 01:16:25,806
We're going to get there before
Montgomery does.

622
01:16:26,042 --> 01:16:30,536
- What's so important about that?
- General Truscott...

623
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:34,511
...if your conscience won't permit
you to conduct this operation...

624
01:16:34,717 --> 01:16:36,412
...I'll find somebody who can.

625
01:16:36,619 --> 01:16:41,716
General, it's your privilege to
relieve me anytime you want to.

626
01:16:41,925 --> 01:16:45,053
This match will not be postponed.

627
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:48,424
Any questions?

628
01:16:54,237 --> 01:16:55,397
No, sir.

629
01:16:55,805 --> 01:16:58,399
You're a very good man, Lucian.

630
01:16:58,641 --> 01:17:01,474
You want to guard against
being too conservative.

631
01:17:01,744 --> 01:17:03,939
Remember what
Frederick the Great said:

632
01:17:04,147 --> 01:17:08,811
<i>"L 'audace, I'audace!</i>
<i>Toujours I'audace!"</i>

633
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:12,754
Go on, have a drink.

634
01:17:13,923 --> 01:17:19,020
Excuse me, sir, I won't be drinking
for the next couple of days.

635
01:17:22,632 --> 01:17:26,124
If anything happens to those men,
I'd like to be there with them.

636
01:17:29,139 --> 01:17:31,505
You're not going, so forget about it.

637
01:17:33,176 --> 01:17:35,701
You believe Truscott's right?

638
01:17:36,513 --> 01:17:37,810
No.

639
01:17:39,349 --> 01:17:42,045
But you're gambling
with those boys' lives...

640
01:17:42,285 --> 01:17:44,845
...just to beat Montgomery
into Messina.

641
01:17:46,022 --> 01:17:49,458
If you pull it off, you're a hero,
but if you don't...

642
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:54,228
What happens to them?
The ordinary combat soldier.

643
01:17:55,031 --> 01:17:59,058
He doesn't share in your dreams
of glory, he's stuck here.

644
01:17:59,836 --> 01:18:04,671
He's living out every day, day-to-day,
with death tugging at his elbow.

645
01:18:08,545 --> 01:18:11,742
There's one big difference
between you and me, George.

646
01:18:13,650 --> 01:18:16,585
I do this job because I've been
trained to do it.

647
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:19,049
You do it because...

648
01:18:21,191 --> 01:18:22,818
...you love it.

649
01:18:38,908 --> 01:18:41,741
The men on the beach are
catching hell, general.

650
01:18:41,945 --> 01:18:45,574
The men are doing their best.
We have no replacements.

651
01:18:45,848 --> 01:18:48,339
I can't break through to the coast.

652
01:18:48,585 --> 01:18:50,553
I'm going down there myself.

653
01:19:05,602 --> 01:19:07,035
Colonel!

654
01:19:08,104 --> 01:19:09,901
How did he get over there?

655
01:19:10,139 --> 01:19:12,039
What the hell are you waiting for?

656
01:19:12,242 --> 01:19:15,803
Looking for a place to ford, general.

657
01:19:16,045 --> 01:19:17,979
I sent a patrol to reconnoiter.

658
01:19:18,214 --> 01:19:22,651
I've done that. Down there this
sewer's no more than 3 feet deep.

659
01:19:22,885 --> 01:19:25,979
Get that outfit cranked up
or you'll be out of a job!

660
01:19:28,091 --> 01:19:31,219
- And put that helmet on.
- Yes, sir.

661
01:19:46,276 --> 01:19:48,403
Move it! Let's go!

662
01:19:58,288 --> 01:20:01,815
- What's holding up this column?
- I don't know, sir.

663
01:20:02,025 --> 01:20:03,151
Planes!

664
01:20:07,497 --> 01:20:08,964
Come on, move it!

665
01:20:32,288 --> 01:20:33,778
Pull up over there.

666
01:20:40,063 --> 01:20:41,690
- Come on.
- What's going on here?

667
01:20:43,032 --> 01:20:44,056
Jackasses!

668
01:20:44,467 --> 01:20:48,904
You let a column get stalled and
strafed on account of two jackasses?!

669
01:20:53,309 --> 01:20:55,038
No. No.

670
01:21:02,752 --> 01:21:05,687
Now, dump them over the side
and clear this bridge!

671
01:21:52,902 --> 01:21:55,769
We're pinned down because
we can't get air support!

672
01:21:56,038 --> 01:21:58,097
Nobody's getting any air support!

673
01:21:58,307 --> 01:22:01,538
Put fire into this battalion,
or I'll get somebody who can.

674
01:22:01,744 --> 01:22:03,075
Major!

675
01:22:03,479 --> 01:22:05,140
You the executive officer here?

676
01:22:05,381 --> 01:22:06,712
- Your name?
- Walker.

677
01:22:06,916 --> 01:22:08,611
You're now commanding officer.

678
01:22:08,818 --> 01:22:11,252
You've got 4 hours to break through
that beachhead.

679
01:22:11,454 --> 01:22:13,479
If you don't make it, I'll fire you.

680
01:22:22,832 --> 01:22:27,633
50,000 men on this island would
like to shoot that son of a bitch.

681
01:23:02,872 --> 01:23:06,205
Please take me home.
Take me home.

682
01:23:07,109 --> 01:23:09,805
Please take me home.
Take me home.

683
01:23:33,636 --> 01:23:38,733
- There he goes, "Old Blood and Guts."
- Yeah, our blood. His guts.

684
01:23:46,148 --> 01:23:47,513
Hi, how are you, son?

685
01:23:55,424 --> 01:23:57,187
Where are you from, Gomez?

686
01:23:58,561 --> 01:24:00,495
California, sir.

687
01:24:00,730 --> 01:24:02,322
Me too.

688
01:24:02,832 --> 01:24:06,734
- Where were you hit?
- In the chest, sir.

689
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:08,567
Well...

690
01:24:09,038 --> 01:24:14,203
...this might be interesting to you.
The last German I saw had no chest.

691
01:24:14,677 --> 01:24:16,542
Didn't have any head either.

692
01:24:18,581 --> 01:24:20,446
You get well quickly, son.

693
01:26:17,299 --> 01:26:18,891
What's the matter with you?

694
01:26:22,872 --> 01:26:25,841
I guess I just can't take it, sir.

695
01:26:29,845 --> 01:26:31,210
What did you say?

696
01:26:34,717 --> 01:26:36,651
It's my nerves, sir.

697
01:26:38,154 --> 01:26:41,021
I just can't stand
the shelling anymore.

698
01:26:43,592 --> 01:26:45,389
Your nerves?

699
01:26:47,229 --> 01:26:50,198
Hell, you're just a goddamn coward.

700
01:26:52,668 --> 01:26:53,999
Shut up!

701
01:26:56,172 --> 01:26:58,538
I won't have
a yellow bastard crying...

702
01:26:59,008 --> 01:27:01,272
...in front of these
brave, wounded men.

703
01:27:04,613 --> 01:27:06,046
Shut up!

704
01:27:08,784 --> 01:27:12,515
Don't admit this yellow bastard.
Nothing wrong with him.

705
01:27:12,755 --> 01:27:17,454
I won't have sons of bitches afraid to
fight stink up this place of honor.

706
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:20,620
You're going back to the front,
my friend.

707
01:27:20,863 --> 01:27:25,527
You may get shot, you may get killed,
but you're going up to the fighting.

708
01:27:26,102 --> 01:27:29,629
Either that or I'll stand you up
in front of a firing squad.

709
01:27:30,072 --> 01:27:34,202
I should shoot you myself,
you bastard! Get him out of here!

710
01:27:36,545 --> 01:27:37,944
Send him up to the front!

711
01:27:38,214 --> 01:27:42,310
You hear me? You goddamn coward!

712
01:27:51,427 --> 01:27:53,588
I won't have cowards in my army.

713
01:28:24,093 --> 01:28:25,583
I had to kick a few butts...

714
01:28:25,795 --> 01:28:29,993
...but Truscott finally broke through
to those people on the beach.

715
01:28:30,266 --> 01:28:32,359
Have you seen the casualty lists?

716
01:28:33,135 --> 01:28:34,659
Yes, I've seen them.

717
01:28:35,538 --> 01:28:37,267
What's the word from the coast road?

718
01:28:37,473 --> 01:28:40,340
The 3rd Division's east of Brolo,
heading toward Messina.

719
01:28:40,543 --> 01:28:44,001
Let's get over there.
I want to go in with the troops.

720
01:28:44,213 --> 01:28:47,182
You go ahead, George.
I'm not very good at that.

721
01:28:48,984 --> 01:28:50,542
General Bradley...

722
01:28:50,786 --> 01:28:54,222
...it's time to consider how many
casualties we'd have...

723
01:28:54,456 --> 01:28:57,857
...if we were still crawling on
that goddamn road.

724
01:30:24,446 --> 01:30:26,471
Forward, march!

725
01:30:44,833 --> 01:30:46,801
Don't smirk, Patton.
I shan't kiss you.

726
01:30:47,970 --> 01:30:53,101
Pity. I shaved close this morning
to prepare for getting smacked by you.

727
01:31:01,917 --> 01:31:03,817
Forward, march!

728
01:31:38,687 --> 01:31:40,712
You wanted to see me, George?

729
01:31:43,325 --> 01:31:45,293
Got a letter here from Ike.

730
01:31:54,003 --> 01:31:57,200
I was rereading Caesar's
<i>Commentaries</i> last night.

731
01:31:59,842 --> 01:32:04,643
In battle, Caesar wore a red robe to
distinguish him from his men.

732
01:32:04,847 --> 01:32:07,372
I was struck by that fact because...

733
01:32:10,152 --> 01:32:13,883
"Despicable." First time anybody's
ever applied that word to me.

734
01:32:14,156 --> 01:32:18,422
Well, at least it's a personal
reprimand, it's not official.

735
01:32:18,694 --> 01:32:22,186
The man was yellow. He should've
been tried for cowardice and shot.

736
01:32:22,431 --> 01:32:26,834
People have taken a lot worse
than a little kick in the pants.

737
01:32:27,069 --> 01:32:30,561
I ruffled his pride a bit.
What's that compared to war?

738
01:32:31,206 --> 01:32:35,267
Two weeks ago at Palermo they said
I was the greatest general...

739
01:32:35,511 --> 01:32:39,914
...since Stonewall Jackson.
- Now they draw cartoons about you.

740
01:32:40,115 --> 01:32:42,049
Dirty bastard!

741
01:32:42,451 --> 01:32:46,581
They got me holding a little GI
and kicking him with an iron boot.

742
01:32:46,789 --> 01:32:49,349
You see that, what's on my boot?
A swastika.

743
01:32:49,591 --> 01:32:52,856
On my boot.
An iron boot with a swastika!

744
01:32:57,366 --> 01:33:00,802
"You will apologize to the soldier
you slapped...

745
01:33:01,403 --> 01:33:05,635
...to all doctors and nurses present
in the tent at the time...

746
01:33:05,941 --> 01:33:08,933
...to every patient in the tent
who can be reached...

747
01:33:09,411 --> 01:33:12,744
...and last but not least
to the 7th Army as a whole...

748
01:33:13,115 --> 01:33:15,982
...through individual units,
one at a time."

749
01:33:21,156 --> 01:33:22,714
God, I...

750
01:33:24,393 --> 01:33:26,054
...feel low.

751
01:33:33,068 --> 01:33:34,558
<i>Oh, God...</i>

752
01:33:34,803 --> 01:33:36,668
<i>... Thou art my God.</i>

753
01:33:37,673 --> 01:33:39,766
<i>Early will I seek Thee.</i>

754
01:33:40,442 --> 01:33:43,570
<i>My soul thirsteth for Thee.</i>

755
01:33:43,812 --> 01:33:48,249
<i>My flesh longeth for Thee</i>
<i>in a dry and thirsty land.</i>

756
01:33:48,484 --> 01:33:52,079
<i>So as I have seen Thee</i>
<i>in the sanctuary.</i>

757
01:33:52,287 --> 01:33:55,484
<i>My soul followeth hard after Thee.</i>

758
01:33:56,458 --> 01:34:00,485
<i>But those that seek my soul</i>
<i>to destroy it...</i>

759
01:34:00,696 --> 01:34:04,154
<i>... shall go into the lower parts</i>
<i>of the earth.</i>

760
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:08,098
<i>They shall fall by the sword.</i>

761
01:34:08,303 --> 01:34:12,103
<i>They shall be apportioned for foxes.</i>

762
01:34:13,175 --> 01:34:16,269
<i>But the king shall rejoice in God.</i>

763
01:34:17,146 --> 01:34:20,547
<i>Everyone that sweareth by him</i>
<i>shall glory.</i>

764
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:25,650
<i>But the mouth of them</i>
<i>that speak lies...</i>

765
01:34:26,321 --> 01:34:28,619
<i>... shall be stopped.</i>

766
01:34:32,895 --> 01:34:35,159
Ten-hut!

767
01:34:37,232 --> 01:34:38,563
At ease.

768
01:34:51,313 --> 01:34:54,646
I thought I'd stand up here
and let you people see...

769
01:34:56,518 --> 01:35:00,716
...if I am as big a son of a bitch
as some of you think I am.

770
01:35:05,527 --> 01:35:08,223
I assure you I had no intention...

771
01:35:09,064 --> 01:35:13,000
...of being either harsh or cruel
in my treatment of the...

772
01:35:13,569 --> 01:35:15,230
...soldier in question.

773
01:35:20,242 --> 01:35:22,836
My sole purpose was to try
to restore in him...

774
01:35:23,045 --> 01:35:26,105
...some appreciation of his
obligations as a man...

775
01:35:27,716 --> 01:35:29,445
...and as a soldier.

776
01:35:31,386 --> 01:35:33,547
If one can shame a coward...

777
01:35:35,357 --> 01:35:39,691
...I felt one might help him
to regain his self-respect.

778
01:35:42,231 --> 01:35:43,789
This was on my mind.

779
01:35:46,134 --> 01:35:48,625
Now, I freely admit...

780
01:35:48,904 --> 01:35:50,963
...that my method was wrong...

781
01:35:51,873 --> 01:35:54,137
...but I hope you understand
my motive...

782
01:35:55,544 --> 01:35:57,603
...and will accept this...

783
01:35:58,213 --> 01:35:59,908
...explanation...

784
01:36:01,583 --> 01:36:03,050
...and this...

785
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,382
...apology.

786
01:36:08,624 --> 01:36:11,991
- Dismissed.
- Ten-hut!

787
01:36:18,133 --> 01:36:22,001
Good evening, general. I want to
report on a private poll I'm taking.

788
01:36:22,271 --> 01:36:23,260
What poll?

789
01:36:23,472 --> 01:36:24,632
The fan mail.

790
01:36:24,906 --> 01:36:27,670
Eleven percent con,
89 percent pro.

791
01:36:27,909 --> 01:36:32,437
And that 11% of protest, in most
cases, is both obscene and anonymous.

792
01:36:32,681 --> 01:36:36,412
But the pro letters are mostly from
relatives and servicemen.

793
01:36:36,618 --> 01:36:40,145
"I want you to know we're proud
our son is serving in your army.

794
01:36:40,422 --> 01:36:44,085
From the newspaper, we're not clear
exactly what you did and why...

795
01:36:44,526 --> 01:36:47,017
...but we want you to know
we're for you.

796
01:36:47,262 --> 01:36:49,025
Keep going, and God bless you."

797
01:36:49,698 --> 01:36:51,461
Keep going, huh?

798
01:36:51,667 --> 01:36:53,100
Where?

799
01:36:56,838 --> 01:37:01,138
I thought you might like a sip
of wine, general. It's New Year's.

800
01:37:01,343 --> 01:37:03,538
You didn't celebrate at all
last night.

801
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:13,720
I'm sick of sitting around this...

802
01:37:13,989 --> 01:37:16,219
...royal doghouse.

803
01:37:16,458 --> 01:37:19,359
We've taken Sicily.
I'm ready for a new assignment.

804
01:37:20,028 --> 01:37:24,795
Maybe you've got it.
Here's a radio message, just came in.

805
01:37:29,304 --> 01:37:30,396
Cod.

806
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:33,073
I've been relieved.

807
01:37:35,410 --> 01:37:38,379
They've relieved me from command
of the 7th Army.

808
01:37:39,181 --> 01:37:41,046
I don't believe it.

809
01:37:44,019 --> 01:37:45,043
Happy New Year.

810
01:37:51,493 --> 01:37:53,154
Just a minute, sir.

811
01:37:54,062 --> 01:37:56,724
Since they're sure to give you
another command...

812
01:37:56,998 --> 01:38:00,434
...isn't it logical they'd
relieve you here first?

813
01:38:01,603 --> 01:38:04,868
You mean command of all American
troops going into Europe?

814
01:38:05,073 --> 01:38:08,668
It's possible. I know it's been
discussed from time to time.

815
01:38:08,910 --> 01:38:13,370
The logic of it is so obvious,
it couldn't mean anything else.

816
01:38:14,916 --> 01:38:19,410
Sir, I'm going to open
this bottle of wine.

817
01:38:19,855 --> 01:38:21,220
No, Sir Cod...

818
01:38:21,456 --> 01:38:25,085
...but if you find a bottle of cognac,
I'll help you drink it.

819
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:36,134
- How you feeling tonight, general?
- Not bad, not bad at all.

820
01:38:36,371 --> 01:38:39,431
- Get me some writing paper, will you?
- Yes, sir.

821
01:38:40,208 --> 01:38:43,006
Your wife ever give you the devil
for not writing?

822
01:38:43,211 --> 01:38:44,610
All the time, sir.

823
01:38:44,813 --> 01:38:48,806
Only I don't write as often as you
do. Don't seem to get around to it.

824
01:38:49,718 --> 01:38:51,242
Lucky for us we got them.

825
01:38:52,220 --> 01:38:55,621
Who wants to marry a couple of
broken-down old horse captains?

826
01:38:55,824 --> 01:38:58,657
That's what my wife says to me
every time I come home, sir.

827
01:38:59,795 --> 01:39:01,456
Why are you up so late, George?

828
01:39:01,730 --> 01:39:04,392
Thought you'd like a nice hot bath
or something.

829
01:39:12,441 --> 01:39:15,933
I got this sleeping pill from the doc,
just in case you need it.

830
01:39:17,279 --> 01:39:18,837
Sleeping pill!

831
01:39:19,414 --> 01:39:22,474
- What's going on here?
- I heard the news, sir.

832
01:39:22,684 --> 01:39:25,949
- They announced it on the radio.
- What news?

833
01:39:26,822 --> 01:39:31,350
About General Bradley, sir. How they
gave him the top American command.

834
01:39:33,195 --> 01:39:34,492
Oh.

835
01:39:35,697 --> 01:39:37,028
Oh, yeah.

836
01:39:39,367 --> 01:39:42,632
I just thought you might be
feeling kind of low, sir.

837
01:39:59,621 --> 01:40:02,647
Your writing things, sir.
Here on the desk, sir.

838
01:40:03,325 --> 01:40:05,953
Yeah. Thank you, George.

839
01:40:08,396 --> 01:40:09,727
One little dog face.

840
01:40:09,998 --> 01:40:13,399
One measly little slap.
That's what done it.

841
01:40:16,037 --> 01:40:18,062
Ah, George.

842
01:40:20,041 --> 01:40:22,874
I wish I'd kissed the son of a bitch.

843
01:43:51,250 --> 01:43:55,653
He's paying tribute to the Free French
Forces under DeGaulle and Leclerc.

844
01:44:11,904 --> 01:44:13,963
And to the people of the Resistance...

845
01:44:14,173 --> 01:44:17,108
...who risk their lives
to help destroy the Germans.

846
01:44:24,416 --> 01:44:27,112
"France will be free again.
I give you my word."

847
01:44:54,413 --> 01:44:58,543
"Just as Free French troops liberated
Corsica, Napoleon's place of birth...

848
01:44:58,817 --> 01:45:03,117
...I will someday land in France to
liberate the birthplace of Lafayette."

849
01:45:07,126 --> 01:45:10,425
General, the reporters would like
a word with you.

850
01:45:13,398 --> 01:45:15,298
- Good afternoon.
- General.

851
01:45:15,501 --> 01:45:18,493
Can you tell us the purpose
of this visit to Corsica?

852
01:45:18,737 --> 01:45:20,568
General Eisenhower ordered me here.

853
01:45:20,773 --> 01:45:25,142
You wrote the mother of the boy you
slapped, "The rat should've been shot."

854
01:45:25,410 --> 01:45:27,742
- Is that true, general?
- No comment.

855
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:30,448
Sir, I understand
Gen. Alexander suggested...

856
01:45:30,749 --> 01:45:33,616
...you take over Gen. Clark's
Italian campaign...

857
01:45:33,852 --> 01:45:36,150
...but it was killed
due to the incident.

858
01:45:36,355 --> 01:45:39,415
- No comment.
- Can you say where you're going, sir?

859
01:45:39,625 --> 01:45:42,458
Off the record,
Eisenhower's ordered me to Malta.

860
01:45:42,661 --> 01:45:43,787
Interview concluded.

861
01:45:43,996 --> 01:45:46,794
You plan on slapping
any soldiers there, general?

862
01:46:17,129 --> 01:46:20,530
In 1528, these forts
were defended by...

863
01:46:20,833 --> 01:46:25,634
...400 Knights of Malta
and 800 mercenaries...

864
01:46:25,871 --> 01:46:30,308
...against a force of 40,000 Turks.

865
01:46:31,076 --> 01:46:32,373
Codman.

866
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:38,206
- Still no word from Gen. Eisenhower?
- No, sir.

867
01:46:38,750 --> 01:46:42,379
Not even a response about
the two turkeys I sent for Christmas?

868
01:46:42,654 --> 01:46:44,087
No, sir.

869
01:46:44,990 --> 01:46:48,426
Go ahead, gentlemen.
Take a closer look for yourselves.

870
01:46:51,830 --> 01:46:56,164
Looks like you boys have hitched
your wagon to a falling star.

871
01:46:57,202 --> 01:47:00,228
Pass the word.
If anyone wants out, I'll understand.

872
01:47:00,439 --> 01:47:04,068
Sir, I can speak for the entire staff.

873
01:47:04,676 --> 01:47:08,908
We want to stay with you, no matter
what duty you're assigned to.

874
01:47:12,517 --> 01:47:15,748
Up in London, they're planning
the invasion of Europe.

875
01:47:17,856 --> 01:47:20,552
I've trained my mind,
body and spirit for that.

876
01:47:20,792 --> 01:47:23,260
What, in God's name, am I doing here?

877
01:47:25,697 --> 01:47:27,028
All right.

878
01:47:27,299 --> 01:47:29,290
Let's get on to Cairo.

879
01:47:29,968 --> 01:47:32,436
See if the pyramids
are still standing.

880
01:48:54,052 --> 01:48:57,317
- This place is for me?
- Yes, sir. This way, sir.

881
01:48:58,657 --> 01:49:01,717
Whoever found it has a genius
for cloak and dagger.

882
01:49:19,711 --> 01:49:21,338
Who picked this cathouse?

883
01:49:21,580 --> 01:49:23,480
I think it was Gen. Smith, sir.

884
01:49:23,682 --> 01:49:25,673
To spite me, that son of a bitch.

885
01:49:25,884 --> 01:49:29,718
- Welcome to London, Georgie.
- Bedell. How are you?

886
01:49:29,921 --> 01:49:32,151
- Is Ike here?
- He asked me to brief you.

887
01:49:32,357 --> 01:49:34,222
Would you excuse us, please?

888
01:49:36,561 --> 01:49:38,586
Let me put you straight about Ike.

889
01:49:38,897 --> 01:49:42,162
We hear a lot about you
criticizing his decisions.

890
01:49:42,434 --> 01:49:45,426
Not really. You know me.
I'm just an old fool.

891
01:49:45,670 --> 01:49:48,764
At times, I do wonder whether
he isn't a limey at heart.

892
01:49:49,007 --> 01:49:52,773
George, this is the toughest coalition
ever attempted in history.

893
01:49:53,045 --> 01:49:57,175
Ike's trying to hold it together
and lick the Germans at the same time.

894
01:49:57,416 --> 01:49:59,441
- It's a hell of a job.
- I understand.

895
01:50:00,085 --> 01:50:04,044
You have an important assignment
connected to the Normandy invasion.

896
01:50:04,289 --> 01:50:08,521
Good. I've studied the Overlord Plan
and there's a number of flaws in it.

897
01:50:08,727 --> 01:50:13,460
You can't depend on Monty taking
Caen by D-day. He'll never make it.

898
01:50:13,732 --> 01:50:16,792
I've drawn up an alternate plan
to land at Calais...

899
01:50:17,069 --> 01:50:21,369
...following an air bombardment...
- Will you just listen for a change?

900
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:24,302
Ike stood by you when everyone,
I mean everyone...

901
01:50:24,576 --> 01:50:27,238
...wanted Patton
with a rope around his neck.

902
01:50:32,784 --> 01:50:36,584
We're gonna let it leak out
that you are here undercover.

903
01:50:36,788 --> 01:50:39,916
That you're preparing to invade
at the Pas de Calais.

904
01:50:40,125 --> 01:50:42,753
We hope to pin down
the German 15th Army there...

905
01:50:42,994 --> 01:50:45,895
...so that they can't be used
against us at Normandy.

906
01:50:46,231 --> 01:50:48,028
Is that all I'm good for?

907
01:50:48,233 --> 01:50:52,431
We're going to build an army
of 12 divisions around you.

908
01:50:52,671 --> 01:50:54,730
All fictitious, of course.

909
01:50:54,973 --> 01:50:57,840
Dummy troop concentrations,
dummy landing craft...

910
01:50:58,076 --> 01:51:00,408
...simulated radio traffic.

911
01:51:00,612 --> 01:51:05,174
The Germans are convinced that you
will lead the main invasion effort.

912
01:51:05,650 --> 01:51:07,515
Their agents will spot you soon...

913
01:51:07,786 --> 01:51:10,346
...then we can move you to Knutsford.

914
01:51:10,589 --> 01:51:13,854
- What do I do there?
- Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

915
01:51:15,093 --> 01:51:18,085
Frankly, George, you're on probation.

916
01:51:18,330 --> 01:51:20,389
Take my advice and behave yourself.

917
01:51:20,599 --> 01:51:22,032
Remember...

918
01:51:22,367 --> 01:51:25,359
...your worst enemy
is your own big mouth.

919
01:52:20,725 --> 01:52:24,217
Look at this nasty-faced
son of a bitch. Ready for combat.

920
01:52:24,429 --> 01:52:27,159
I'll call him William
as in "the Conqueror."

921
01:52:27,499 --> 01:52:31,401
- Sir, should we leave him in the car?
- No. Good afternoon, ladies.

922
01:52:31,670 --> 01:52:33,399
Good afternoon.

923
01:52:38,210 --> 01:52:39,837
Watch this, Cod.

924
01:52:40,111 --> 01:52:42,602
- Sir, he'll kill that dog.
- I'll hold him.

925
01:52:52,057 --> 01:52:55,891
I'm terribly sorry, general.
Did Abigail frighten your dog?

926
01:52:57,362 --> 01:52:59,262
That's quite all right, madam.

927
01:53:00,098 --> 01:53:01,565
This way, sir.

928
01:53:03,768 --> 01:53:05,258
Your name isn't William.

929
01:53:06,271 --> 01:53:07,795
It's Willy.

930
01:53:10,775 --> 01:53:12,265
My dear friends.

931
01:53:12,611 --> 01:53:16,877
General George S. Patton, Jr.,
has accepted our invitation...

932
01:53:17,148 --> 01:53:18,638
...to say a few words to you...

933
01:53:18,917 --> 01:53:21,647
...on the occasion
of this inaugural ceremony.

934
01:53:27,392 --> 01:53:31,055
General Patton is not here
in an official capacity...

935
01:53:31,404 --> 01:53:33,895
...and I have assured him
most earnestly...

936
01:53:34,107 --> 01:53:36,541
...that nothing he says
will be quoted.

937
01:53:39,946 --> 01:53:42,972
May I present General Patton.

938
01:53:54,261 --> 01:53:56,729
- Remember, sir, watch your language.
- Yeah.

939
01:53:57,163 --> 01:53:58,892
My dear ladies.

940
01:53:59,499 --> 01:54:01,330
Until today...

941
01:54:01,601 --> 01:54:06,732
...my only experience
at welcoming has been...

942
01:54:06,973 --> 01:54:12,104
...to welcome Germans and Italians
to the infernal region.

943
01:54:13,613 --> 01:54:16,173
At this I have been
quite successful...

944
01:54:16,416 --> 01:54:19,544
...since the troops, which I have had
the honor to command...

945
01:54:19,753 --> 01:54:22,415
...have, to date, killed or captured...

946
01:54:22,689 --> 01:54:26,250
...some 170,000 of our enemies.

947
01:54:35,001 --> 01:54:40,132
I feel that such clubs as these
are of very real value...

948
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:43,338
...because I believe
with Mr. Bernard Shaw...

949
01:54:43,543 --> 01:54:47,274
...that the British and the Americans
are two peoples...

950
01:54:47,514 --> 01:54:51,177
...separated by a common language.

951
01:54:53,887 --> 01:54:58,881
Since it is the destiny of the British
and Americans to rule the world...

952
01:55:00,393 --> 01:55:02,452
...the better we know each other...

953
01:55:02,696 --> 01:55:04,561
...the better we will do it.

954
01:55:05,799 --> 01:55:08,290
The Russians,
don't forget the Russians.

955
01:55:08,735 --> 01:55:10,396
I think that a club like this...

956
01:55:10,704 --> 01:55:14,140
...is an ideal place
for promoting mutual understanding.

957
01:55:15,008 --> 01:55:20,378
Because as soon as our soldiers meet
and get to know the English ladies...

958
01:55:20,847 --> 01:55:26,217
...and write home and tell our women
just how lovely you truly are...

959
01:55:30,890 --> 01:55:33,825
...then the sooner the American ladies
will get jealous...

960
01:55:34,094 --> 01:55:37,029
...and force this war
to a quick termination.

961
01:55:41,067 --> 01:55:46,061
And then I'll get the chance to go
to the Pacific and kill Japanese.

962
01:56:04,724 --> 01:56:06,123
<i>All over the nation...</i>

963
01:56:06,359 --> 01:56:10,295
<i>... mass meetings are held to protest</i>
<i>General Patton's statement...</i>

964
01:56:10,563 --> 01:56:13,396
<i>... that Britain and America</i>
<i>will rule the postwar world.</i>

965
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:15,534
<i>That Russia will have no say.</i>

966
01:56:15,735 --> 01:56:20,035
<i>Congressional leaders like Senator</i>
<i>Clayburn Foss are quick to react.</i>

967
01:56:20,273 --> 01:56:22,969
<i>This man has insulted</i>
<i>our Russian allies...</i>

968
01:56:23,243 --> 01:56:26,110
<i>... implying Anglo-American world rule.</i>

969
01:56:26,379 --> 01:56:29,439
<i>In my opinion, he should be</i>
<i>severely disciplined.</i>

970
01:56:29,816 --> 01:56:31,750
This time I didn't do a damn thing.

971
01:56:32,051 --> 01:56:34,645
They promised there
wouldn't be any reporters.

972
01:56:34,921 --> 01:56:37,151
I made a few remarks off the record.

973
01:56:37,424 --> 01:56:39,824
Ike told you to keep your mouth shut.

974
01:56:40,093 --> 01:56:43,893
You know how suspicious the Russians
are of the British and us.

975
01:56:44,097 --> 01:56:47,396
I was only trying to be polite
to the old ladies.

976
01:56:47,634 --> 01:56:53,072
If I'd seen the Russians there, I'd
have mentioned the sons of bitches.

977
01:56:53,406 --> 01:56:56,341
Bedell, I don't know
anything about politics.

978
01:56:56,609 --> 01:56:58,509
I have no political ambitions.

979
01:56:58,778 --> 01:57:01,770
All I want to do is
to command an army in combat.

980
01:57:02,081 --> 01:57:04,072
Well, it's out of our hands now.

981
01:57:04,317 --> 01:57:07,650
Ike sent a message last night
to the chief of staff.

982
01:57:07,854 --> 01:57:13,019
Now it's up to General Marshall
whether you stay here as a decoy...

983
01:57:13,293 --> 01:57:15,284
...or he sends you home.

984
01:57:17,797 --> 01:57:19,458
He's a good man.

985
01:57:19,999 --> 01:57:22,194
At least he's a fair man.

986
01:57:22,669 --> 01:57:24,466
I'll let it sit with him.

987
01:57:39,552 --> 01:57:40,985
George...

988
01:57:42,188 --> 01:57:44,486
...our war is over.

989
01:57:44,724 --> 01:57:45,952
Over, sir?

990
01:57:46,526 --> 01:57:49,893
It's just a question of waiting
for the orders now.

991
01:57:57,504 --> 01:57:59,301
I feel I'm...

992
01:58:00,974 --> 01:58:05,343
I'm destined to achieve some
great thing. What, I don't know.

993
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:11,176
But this last incident is...

994
01:58:11,985 --> 01:58:15,978
...so trivial in its nature
and so terrible in its effect...

995
01:58:16,556 --> 01:58:20,151
It can't be an accident.
It has to be the work of God.

996
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:22,425
Yes, sir.

997
01:58:23,096 --> 01:58:25,656
The last great opportunity
of a lifetime...

998
01:58:25,865 --> 01:58:30,359
...an entire world at war
and I'm left out of it?

999
01:58:30,603 --> 01:58:32,002
No, sir.

1000
01:58:32,205 --> 01:58:34,264
God will not permit this to happen!

1001
01:58:34,774 --> 01:58:39,336
I am going to be allowed
to fulfill my destiny!

1002
01:58:44,284 --> 01:58:46,218
His will be done.

1003
01:58:58,865 --> 01:59:02,357
<i>In the greatest amphibious operation</i>
<i>ever attempted...</i>

1004
01:59:02,569 --> 01:59:05,265
<i>... a predawn naval bombardment</i>
<i>prepares the way...</i>

1005
01:59:05,471 --> 01:59:08,531
<i>... for allied soldiers to assault</i>
<i>the Normandy beaches...</i>

1006
01:59:08,741 --> 01:59:12,302
<i>... and claw out a desperate foothold</i>
<i>on the continent of Europe.</i>

1007
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:32,727
I knew Montgomery couldn't take Caen
on D-day or D-plus-10. And I said so.

1008
01:59:32,966 --> 01:59:36,902
And here they are all hung up
in the hedgerow country.

1009
01:59:37,170 --> 01:59:41,266
They should pivot the way von
Schlieffen planned it in World War I.

1010
01:59:42,175 --> 01:59:45,838
Then we might get a chance to do
some real broken field running.

1011
01:59:46,913 --> 01:59:48,813
But they don't listen to me.

1012
01:59:51,951 --> 01:59:54,476
What a way to enter
the continent of Europe.

1013
01:59:54,687 --> 01:59:57,121
Along with all the rest
of the spare parts.

1014
01:59:57,757 --> 02:00:00,453
Sir, everything on this plane
is high priority.

1015
02:00:01,628 --> 02:00:05,359
Gen. Bradley wouldn't send for you
unless he had something in mind.

1016
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:09,193
I'll tell you, Cod.
I've learned my lesson.

1017
02:00:09,836 --> 02:00:13,363
If I ever do get another chance,
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.

1018
02:00:15,274 --> 02:00:17,139
I'm gonna play the game.

1019
02:00:17,610 --> 02:00:19,635
If I forget, you remind me.

1020
02:00:20,446 --> 02:00:24,712
- I'll give a gentle nudge in the ribs.
- Give me a swift kick in the ass.

1021
02:00:25,618 --> 02:00:26,846
Yes, sir.

1022
02:00:48,708 --> 02:00:50,198
Welcome to France, sir.

1023
02:00:50,410 --> 02:00:52,878
Hope the war's still on.
Where's the boss?

1024
02:00:53,079 --> 02:00:54,341
Right this way, sir.

1025
02:01:31,517 --> 02:01:35,112
Patton, haven't seen you
since Messina.

1026
02:01:35,354 --> 02:01:36,412
How are you?

1027
02:01:36,622 --> 02:01:39,352
You're doing a splendid job
decoying the Jerries.

1028
02:01:39,592 --> 02:01:42,083
You'll forgive me,
I'm off to the front.

1029
02:01:42,295 --> 02:01:44,092
Best of everything, old boy.

1030
02:01:48,201 --> 02:01:49,725
By the way...

1031
02:01:50,203 --> 02:01:53,639
...intelligence confirms
that I'm against Rommel again.

1032
02:01:58,411 --> 02:01:59,742
Rommel.

1033
02:02:01,714 --> 02:02:03,147
Hi, how are you, George?

1034
02:02:04,083 --> 02:02:07,450
- Pretty fair, Brad. How are you?
- Fine.

1035
02:02:11,290 --> 02:02:13,485
Well. My, my.

1036
02:02:13,726 --> 02:02:15,421
Isn't this plush?

1037
02:02:15,661 --> 02:02:18,630
Looks like you're
bucking for archbishop.

1038
02:02:18,831 --> 02:02:22,130
Chet Hansen had this rig built for me.
George, sit down.

1039
02:02:22,735 --> 02:02:26,728
Ike wanted me to talk to you
since we can level with each other.

1040
02:02:26,939 --> 02:02:28,099
That's right.

1041
02:02:28,975 --> 02:02:32,911
We're making 3rd Army operational
when I take over 12th Army group.

1042
02:02:33,112 --> 02:02:34,579
Do I get it?

1043
02:02:35,181 --> 02:02:36,842
I'll be honest with you.

1044
02:02:37,150 --> 02:02:38,777
I've had reservations.

1045
02:02:39,619 --> 02:02:42,679
You've been my senior ever since
I left the academy.

1046
02:02:42,989 --> 02:02:46,857
You were the boss in North Africa
and Sicily and I just thought...

1047
02:02:48,161 --> 02:02:50,356
...well, it might be a problem for us.

1048
02:02:50,863 --> 02:02:52,524
It wouldn't bother me.

1049
02:02:52,765 --> 02:02:54,699
There's one other thing.

1050
02:02:55,001 --> 02:02:56,992
We're different kinds of people.

1051
02:02:57,236 --> 02:03:00,069
Goddamn it, Brad, you're always right.

1052
02:03:00,273 --> 02:03:04,767
With your brains and my screwy ideas,
we make a great team, like in Sicily.

1053
02:03:05,211 --> 02:03:09,511
Truthfully, if I had been your senior
in Sicily, I would have relieved you.

1054
02:03:12,018 --> 02:03:13,212
Brad...

1055
02:03:14,954 --> 02:03:17,684
...I'm not crawling on my belly
to get a command.

1056
02:03:17,890 --> 02:03:20,518
For God's sake, get me in this fight.

1057
02:03:22,128 --> 02:03:25,586
The only way out of the doghouse
is to do something great.

1058
02:03:25,865 --> 02:03:27,457
I gotta get back in the war!

1059
02:03:27,700 --> 02:03:30,897
Hitler's own people tried
to kill him a few days ago.

1060
02:03:31,137 --> 02:03:33,469
First thing you know,
it'll be over and...

1061
02:03:36,809 --> 02:03:38,037
I'II...

1062
02:03:40,379 --> 02:03:43,246
...keep my mouth shut.
I'll behave myself.

1063
02:03:46,118 --> 02:03:47,881
I give you my word.

1064
02:03:51,657 --> 02:03:53,056
George...

1065
02:03:53,759 --> 02:03:56,387
...I've been working
on a plan called Cobra.

1066
02:03:56,963 --> 02:03:58,624
I'd like your opinion.

1067
02:03:58,831 --> 02:04:01,265
We've been slugging through
hedgerow country...

1068
02:04:01,467 --> 02:04:04,664
...half an acre a day
and we've got to find a way out.

1069
02:04:04,904 --> 02:04:06,462
I want to use this road.

1070
02:04:06,672 --> 02:04:08,469
The Saint Lפ-Periers road.

1071
02:04:08,674 --> 02:04:11,336
Monty will pin down
the enemy forces at Caen.

1072
02:04:11,577 --> 02:04:15,240
We'll pulverize an area
31/2 miles wide with bombing.

1073
02:04:15,448 --> 02:04:17,439
Then seven divisions will follow.

1074
02:04:17,683 --> 02:04:22,848
The 3rd Army will swing around here, a
sweeping end run right across France.

1075
02:04:23,589 --> 02:04:24,920
What do you think?

1076
02:04:26,192 --> 02:04:31,630
I think you'll need a screwball old
cavalryman to command the 3rd Army.

1077
02:04:32,765 --> 02:04:34,323
George...

1078
02:04:36,435 --> 02:04:41,270
...Ike came to that conclusion
in London three months ago.

1079
02:04:41,841 --> 02:04:43,103
He what?

1080
02:04:43,943 --> 02:04:48,141
Why, that dirty...!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1081
02:04:48,381 --> 02:04:50,372
I promise to keep my mouth shut.

1082
02:06:46,999 --> 02:06:50,093
George could have the courtesy
to tell us where he's going.

1083
02:07:03,282 --> 02:07:06,843
Good God, look at that.
Where you going, general?

1084
02:07:07,153 --> 02:07:08,313
Berlin.

1085
02:07:08,521 --> 02:07:12,457
I'm going to personally shoot
that paper-hanging son of a bitch.

1086
02:07:53,799 --> 02:07:57,235
Hold it. Hold it!

1087
02:07:58,370 --> 02:07:59,735
This place isn't on the map.

1088
02:08:00,039 --> 02:08:02,872
You know why?
We've run clear off the map.

1089
02:08:14,653 --> 02:08:17,178
Give George a headline,
and he's good for another 30 miles.

1090
02:09:16,582 --> 02:09:18,573
Atten-hut!

1091
02:09:19,618 --> 02:09:20,880
Hold it!

1092
02:09:25,124 --> 02:09:28,821
Pay attention. We're gonna clean
this mess up right now.

1093
02:09:29,094 --> 02:09:32,791
Let's move this vehicle out this way.
This one out this way.

1094
02:09:32,998 --> 02:09:35,899
Back that thing up there,
and we'll take this one here.

1095
02:09:36,135 --> 02:09:38,603
All right, get up off your ass.
Let's go now!

1096
02:09:50,349 --> 02:09:52,180
That's it.
That's the way to move.

1097
02:09:52,451 --> 02:09:55,284
Good boy. All right, come on.

1098
02:09:55,588 --> 02:09:58,819
Come on, now. Here we go. Come on.
That's it!

1099
02:09:59,024 --> 02:10:00,924
That's it! Gun it!

1100
02:10:01,493 --> 02:10:03,427
Gun that thing!

1101
02:10:03,696 --> 02:10:05,527
Okay, come on.

1102
02:10:07,132 --> 02:10:08,429
Watch it!

1103
02:10:09,134 --> 02:10:11,602
Go, go, go! Come on.
Hold it up.

1104
02:10:11,837 --> 02:10:14,032
Come on, baby. Yeah, yeah.
Come on.

1105
02:10:15,174 --> 02:10:16,766
That's it.

1106
02:10:17,376 --> 02:10:18,866
Come on, now.

1107
02:10:26,352 --> 02:10:29,981
Come on, keep coming. Keep coming.
Hold it up there.

1108
02:10:32,858 --> 02:10:34,325
Now come on! Hold it!

1109
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:37,859
Hey, dummy, hold the fricking tank!

1110
02:10:43,135 --> 02:10:44,534
That's it. Come on.

1111
02:10:44,803 --> 02:10:46,202
Good boy.

1112
02:10:49,008 --> 02:10:50,566
- Hold it up there.
- General!

1113
02:10:50,843 --> 02:10:53,175
General Bradley wants to have
a word with you.

1114
02:10:53,412 --> 02:10:56,347
Okay. Come on!

1115
02:10:57,483 --> 02:11:01,852
Okay. Hold it up. Take over.

1116
02:11:09,361 --> 02:11:12,023
George, you'd make a good traffic cop.

1117
02:11:13,766 --> 02:11:16,428
George this drive has been
magnificent...

1118
02:11:16,669 --> 02:11:19,536
...but I'm sorry to say
I have to slow you down.

1119
02:11:19,738 --> 02:11:23,902
- What the hell for?
- We'll have to cut off your supplies.

1120
02:11:24,176 --> 02:11:27,942
Gasoline, ammunition, everything.
We're up against new priorities.

1121
02:11:28,213 --> 02:11:31,842
- I think I smell Montgomery.
- Take it easy, George.

1122
02:11:32,084 --> 02:11:35,110
There are serious issues involved.
Political issues.

1123
02:11:35,354 --> 02:11:37,219
By God, it is Montgomery.

1124
02:11:37,423 --> 02:11:41,359
The launching sites for the B-2 bombs
are all in his area.

1125
02:11:41,593 --> 02:11:43,618
Churchill wants those bases destroyed.

1126
02:11:44,096 --> 02:11:47,259
Hitler kills more civilians
in London than soldiers.

1127
02:11:47,466 --> 02:11:49,195
Expect Montgomery to do anything?

1128
02:11:49,935 --> 02:11:53,701
You give me gasoline and I'll gain
ground with it, kill Germans too.

1129
02:11:53,939 --> 02:11:55,873
Give me 400,000 gallons.
I'll go to Berlin.

1130
02:11:56,108 --> 02:11:57,700
George, I can't do it.

1131
02:11:57,943 --> 02:11:59,877
The Siegfried line
is an empty shell.

1132
02:12:00,112 --> 02:12:02,307
They stripped the equipment
and sent it east.

1133
02:12:02,548 --> 02:12:05,312
It's crawling with cows.
I can punch through in two days.

1134
02:12:05,551 --> 02:12:08,577
There's no use in arguing with me.
It wasn't my idea.

1135
02:12:08,787 --> 02:12:10,812
Why did you pick me to command?

1136
02:12:11,090 --> 02:12:13,115
I didn't pick you.

1137
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:16,450
Ike picked you.

1138
02:12:19,898 --> 02:12:22,298
George, you have performed
brilliantly.

1139
02:12:22,668 --> 02:12:24,431
You are loyal, dedicated.

1140
02:12:24,670 --> 02:12:27,503
You're one of the best I've got,
but you don't know when to shut up.

1141
02:12:27,773 --> 02:12:31,470
George, you're a pain in the neck.

1142
02:12:35,180 --> 02:12:37,444
I have a lot of faults, Brad.

1143
02:12:37,750 --> 02:12:40,150
But ingratitude isn't one of them.

1144
02:12:40,419 --> 02:12:41,943
I owe you a lot.

1145
02:12:43,088 --> 02:12:46,683
Hell, I know I'm a prima donna.
I admit it.

1146
02:12:47,025 --> 02:12:50,256
What I can't stand about Monty is,
he won't admit it.

1147
02:13:15,654 --> 02:13:18,851
Captain, the Bailey's run out of gas.

1148
02:13:19,358 --> 02:13:21,121
The point tank has run out too.

1149
02:13:22,795 --> 02:13:25,059
And there's a kraut column up ahead.

1150
02:13:25,497 --> 02:13:26,964
Yeah, I know.

1151
02:15:29,121 --> 02:15:31,021
Were you in command here, captain?

1152
02:15:32,591 --> 02:15:33,615
I was in command.

1153
02:15:34,626 --> 02:15:38,460
My tank platoon was supporting
an infantry company.

1154
02:15:38,697 --> 02:15:43,532
Tanks ran out of gas,
so we had to fight it out.

1155
02:15:45,037 --> 02:15:47,699
We started 11:00 last night.

1156
02:15:49,174 --> 02:15:51,267
Finished a couple hours ago.

1157
02:15:53,445 --> 02:15:57,973
This morning the fighting
was hand-to-hand.

1158
02:16:46,331 --> 02:16:48,196
I had a dream last night.

1159
02:16:50,402 --> 02:16:53,599
In my dream it came to me...

1160
02:16:53,839 --> 02:16:57,172
...that right now the whole Nazi Reich
is mine for the taking.

1161
02:16:57,409 --> 02:17:01,743
Think about that, Cod.
I was nearly sent home in disgrace.

1162
02:17:02,447 --> 02:17:05,075
Now I have precisely
the right instrument...

1163
02:17:05,283 --> 02:17:10,084
...at precisely the right moment of
history and exactly the right place.

1164
02:17:10,389 --> 02:17:11,720
The Saar?

1165
02:17:11,957 --> 02:17:14,050
This will change too, very quickly.

1166
02:17:14,259 --> 02:17:16,887
Like a planet spinning off
into the universe.

1167
02:17:17,129 --> 02:17:20,030
A moment like this won't come again
for 1000 years.

1168
02:17:20,232 --> 02:17:23,030
All I need is a few
miserable gallons of gasoline.

1169
02:17:23,435 --> 02:17:26,962
Right now, the weak spot is here.

1170
02:17:28,540 --> 02:17:31,976
In 10 days, we could be in Berlin.

1171
02:17:32,244 --> 02:17:35,736
What about the fortifications
that were done in Metz?

1172
02:17:37,582 --> 02:17:39,743
Fixed fortifications, huh?

1173
02:17:40,052 --> 02:17:43,044
Monuments to the stupidity of man.

1174
02:17:43,822 --> 02:17:47,383
When mountain ranges and oceans
could be overcome...

1175
02:17:47,592 --> 02:17:49,583
...anything built by man
can be overcome.

1176
02:17:54,332 --> 02:17:56,994
You know how I'm sure
they're finished out there?

1177
02:17:59,171 --> 02:18:00,570
The carts.

1178
02:18:02,307 --> 02:18:05,572
They're using carts to move
their wounded and the supplies.

1179
02:18:07,446 --> 02:18:11,439
The carts came to me in my dream.
I couldn't figure it out.

1180
02:18:12,751 --> 02:18:14,514
Then I remembered...

1181
02:18:16,354 --> 02:18:20,814
...that nightmare in the snow.
The agonizing retreat from Moscow.

1182
02:18:21,660 --> 02:18:23,491
How cold it was.

1183
02:18:26,965 --> 02:18:30,594
They threw the wounded and what was
left of the supplies in the carts.

1184
02:18:31,837 --> 02:18:33,702
Napoleon was finished.

1185
02:18:36,007 --> 02:18:38,703
Not any color left.
Not even the red of blood.

1186
02:18:39,978 --> 02:18:41,673
Only the snow.

1187
02:18:46,718 --> 02:18:48,117
Look at this, Cod.

1188
02:18:55,827 --> 02:18:57,294
I love it.

1189
02:19:01,299 --> 02:19:03,563
God help me, I do love it so.

1190
02:19:07,706 --> 02:19:09,196
I love it more than my life.

1191
02:19:18,416 --> 02:19:21,681
<i>Paris is liberated,</i>
<i>and French troops lead the way.</i>

1192
02:19:22,487 --> 02:19:27,186
<i>The Allies march into the city</i>
<i>after four years of Nazi occupation.</i>

1193
02:19:27,592 --> 02:19:30,425
<i>The hard-fighting French</i>
<i>2nd Armored Division...</i>

1194
02:19:30,662 --> 02:19:33,028
<i>... under Major General</i>
<i>Jacques Leclerc...</i>

1195
02:19:33,231 --> 02:19:35,062
<i>... gets an unforgettable welcome...</i>

1196
02:19:35,534 --> 02:19:37,593
<i>... as they enter their beloved Paris.</i>

1197
02:19:42,741 --> 02:19:44,606
<i>In a powerful drive to the north...</i>

1198
02:19:44,843 --> 02:19:48,438
<i>... General Montgomery cuts off and</i>
<i>bypasses the French coastal towns...</i>

1199
02:19:48,680 --> 02:19:51,080
<i>... of Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk.</i>

1200
02:19:51,349 --> 02:19:54,580
<i>Pushing on to capture the vital</i>
<i>Belgian port of Antwerp.</i>

1201
02:20:00,592 --> 02:20:02,355
<i>Meanwhile, the main body</i>
<i>of Patton's army...</i>

1202
02:20:02,561 --> 02:20:06,930
<i>... resupplied now and rolling like a</i>
<i>juggernaut, slashes toward the Saar.</i>

1203
02:20:07,866 --> 02:20:09,891
<i>Nazi resistance appears to crumble.</i>

1204
02:20:10,202 --> 02:20:14,866
<i>It seems that nothing can stop our</i>
<i>troops from driving on into Germany.</i>

1205
02:20:23,648 --> 02:20:26,776
- Sir, General Bradley on your line.
- Good, good.

1206
02:20:32,924 --> 02:20:35,620
Brad, listen, I've got a bridgehead
across the Saar.

1207
02:20:35,894 --> 02:20:37,054
I'm on my way to Germany.

1208
02:20:37,329 --> 02:20:39,923
Wait a minute, George.
There's a lot of trouble up north.

1209
02:20:40,232 --> 02:20:45,295
I want you to transfer tank armor
to Middleton's 8th Corps right away.

1210
02:20:45,770 --> 02:20:47,260
Brad, you can't do that.

1211
02:20:47,672 --> 02:20:50,607
George, listen.
I don't have time to argue.

1212
02:20:50,909 --> 02:20:53,639
There's a lot of enemy activity
up around Ardennes.

1213
02:20:53,945 --> 02:20:56,243
No, I don't know how serious it is...

1214
02:20:56,448 --> 02:21:00,942
...but Ike wants us to meet
with Bedell Smith tomorrow at Verdun.

1215
02:21:01,186 --> 02:21:02,448
Be there at 1100.

1216
02:21:02,921 --> 02:21:04,320
Yes, sir.

1217
02:21:45,230 --> 02:21:48,063
There's absolutely no reason
for us to assume...

1218
02:21:48,333 --> 02:21:50,995
...that the Germans are mounting
a major offense.

1219
02:21:52,337 --> 02:21:56,467
The weather is awful
and their supplies are low.

1220
02:21:57,342 --> 02:22:01,039
The Germans haven't mounted a winter
attack since Frederick the Great.

1221
02:22:03,815 --> 02:22:06,978
Therefore I believe that's exactly
what they're going to do.

1222
02:22:48,760 --> 02:22:51,729
I want you to start making
contingency plans...

1223
02:22:51,963 --> 02:22:53,692
...for pulling out
of our eastward attack.

1224
02:22:54,065 --> 02:22:56,795
Changing directions 90 degrees,
moving up to Luxembourg.

1225
02:22:58,603 --> 02:23:00,434
Don't look so stunned, gentlemen.

1226
02:23:01,206 --> 02:23:03,766
I want you to plan
for three possible axes of attack.

1227
02:23:03,975 --> 02:23:05,909
From Diekirch, due north.

1228
02:23:06,144 --> 02:23:10,478
From Orlיans to Bastogne.

1229
02:23:10,715 --> 02:23:14,207
From Neufchגteau against the German
left flank.

1230
02:23:34,572 --> 02:23:36,836
We've identified four German armies:

1231
02:23:37,108 --> 02:23:42,102
The 7th, the 5th Panzer,
6th SS Panzer and the 15th.

1232
02:23:42,647 --> 02:23:44,638
They've hit us with 26 divisions.

1233
02:23:44,916 --> 02:23:47,783
They've overran two regimens
of the 106th Division.

1234
02:23:48,019 --> 02:23:51,147
And 7500 of our men
were forced to surrender.

1235
02:23:51,489 --> 02:23:54,014
Our concern is that von Rundstedt...

1236
02:23:54,259 --> 02:23:58,195
...has the 101st Airborne trapped
here at Bastogne.

1237
02:24:01,132 --> 02:24:05,296
Bastogne, by the way, is the key
to this entire area.

1238
02:24:06,104 --> 02:24:09,938
If we can hold it, we can break up
the entire German offensive.

1239
02:24:10,508 --> 02:24:13,272
If they take it,
we're in serious trouble.

1240
02:24:14,345 --> 02:24:16,711
Ike wants to know if anybody can go...

1241
02:24:16,948 --> 02:24:20,179
...and relieve the 101st
before they're torn to pieces.

1242
02:24:22,487 --> 02:24:24,785
There's nothing Montgomery can do.

1243
02:24:25,023 --> 02:24:27,389
At any rate, not for some weeks.

1244
02:24:28,126 --> 02:24:30,117
What about you, George?

1245
02:24:31,029 --> 02:24:33,463
I can attack with three divisions
in 48 hours.

1246
02:24:37,469 --> 02:24:39,130
I'd give myself some leeway.

1247
02:24:39,671 --> 02:24:41,798
Ike wants a realistic estimate,
George.

1248
02:24:42,040 --> 02:24:46,170
You're in the middle of a fight now.
It's over a hundred miles to Bastogne.

1249
02:24:46,478 --> 02:24:48,742
My staff's already working
out the details.

1250
02:24:51,049 --> 02:24:54,075
Frankly, I don't see how
it's possible.

1251
02:24:54,552 --> 02:24:56,577
Not in this kind of weather.

1252
02:24:57,222 --> 02:25:00,089
I should have thought you'd want
to fall back and regroup.

1253
02:25:00,325 --> 02:25:03,089
Not me. I don't like to pay
for the same real estate twice.

1254
02:25:03,361 --> 02:25:04,658
But what about your men?

1255
02:25:04,996 --> 02:25:09,262
You can't cart them off 100 miles,
expecting them to attack without rest.

1256
02:25:09,667 --> 02:25:10,827
I trained these men.

1257
02:25:11,069 --> 02:25:13,003
They'll do what I tell them to do.

1258
02:25:13,238 --> 02:25:16,935
We hadn't realized you were
so popular with your troops, general.

1259
02:25:18,276 --> 02:25:22,235
I'm not. They'll do it
because they're good soldiers.

1260
02:25:22,514 --> 02:25:26,348
And because they realize, as I do,
that we can still lose this war.

1261
02:25:29,621 --> 02:25:32,419
Then I think I can speak
for Field Marshal Montgomery.

1262
02:25:33,291 --> 02:25:35,691
He'd say you're asking
the impossible of your men.

1263
02:25:35,960 --> 02:25:37,518
Of course he would.

1264
02:25:37,762 --> 02:25:41,027
Cause he's never realized that's
what we're in business for.

1265
02:26:59,277 --> 02:27:01,711
General McAuliffe refused
a German surrender demand.

1266
02:27:02,013 --> 02:27:03,605
You know what he said?

1267
02:27:04,716 --> 02:27:05,978
What?

1268
02:27:06,351 --> 02:27:07,978
He said, "Nuts."

1269
02:27:10,188 --> 02:27:11,485
Keep them moving, colonel.

1270
02:27:11,689 --> 02:27:14,021
A man that eloquent has to be saved.

1271
02:29:32,296 --> 02:29:34,196
This is where it pays off.

1272
02:29:34,532 --> 02:29:36,159
The training and discipline.

1273
02:29:37,268 --> 02:29:39,429
No other outfit in the world.

1274
02:29:40,104 --> 02:29:43,801
Pulled out of a winter battle,
move a hundred miles.

1275
02:29:44,041 --> 02:29:48,137
Going to a major attack with no rest,
no sleep, no hot food.

1276
02:29:48,346 --> 02:29:52,043
God! God, I'm proud of these men!

1277
02:30:17,675 --> 02:30:21,805
Sir, von Rundstedt's thrown another
panzer division against Bastogne.

1278
02:30:22,079 --> 02:30:24,309
101st Airborne's barely holding on.

1279
02:30:24,515 --> 02:30:28,849
We need damned air cover. If we had
decent weather, we might make it.

1280
02:30:29,320 --> 02:30:31,379
General Mason, sir.

1281
02:30:45,937 --> 02:30:49,065
Hello, Mase?
Listen, we're short on foot soldiers.

1282
02:30:49,340 --> 02:30:53,037
Cannibalize your antiaircraft units
and turn them into riflemen.

1283
02:30:53,244 --> 02:30:55,109
Yes, every last one you can find.

1284
02:30:55,413 --> 02:30:56,675
Good evening, general.

1285
02:30:56,914 --> 02:31:00,111
I just got the weather report
for tomorrow. More snow.

1286
02:31:00,384 --> 02:31:02,352
There goes our air cover.

1287
02:31:02,587 --> 02:31:05,249
We may have to wait
for better weather.

1288
02:31:05,523 --> 02:31:10,392
Brave men dying up there. I won't
wait, not an hour, not a minute.

1289
02:31:12,730 --> 02:31:14,197
Going to keep moving.

1290
02:31:14,432 --> 02:31:16,195
Is that clear?

1291
02:31:18,269 --> 02:31:21,864
We're going to attack all night
and attack tomorrow morning!

1292
02:31:22,907 --> 02:31:25,137
If we're not victorious...

1293
02:31:27,445 --> 02:31:29,436
...let no one come back alive.

1294
02:31:41,225 --> 02:31:42,920
You know something, general?

1295
02:31:43,160 --> 02:31:47,494
Sometimes, they can't tell when
you're acting and when you're not.

1296
02:31:49,233 --> 02:31:51,428
It isn't important for them to know.

1297
02:31:53,004 --> 02:31:55,234
It's only important for me to know.

1298
02:32:02,280 --> 02:32:05,613
- You want to see me, general?
- Oh, yeah, chaplain.

1299
02:32:05,816 --> 02:32:08,444
I'm tired of 3rd Army
having to fight Germans...

1300
02:32:08,686 --> 02:32:11,018
...with supreme command,
no gasoline...

1301
02:32:11,255 --> 02:32:13,246
...and now this ungodly weather.

1302
02:32:13,524 --> 02:32:15,583
I want a prayer, a weather prayer.

1303
02:32:16,627 --> 02:32:17,958
A weather prayer, sir?

1304
02:32:18,195 --> 02:32:21,289
Yes, let's see if you can't get God
working with us.

1305
02:32:21,499 --> 02:32:23,967
Gonna take a thick rug
for that kind of praying.

1306
02:32:24,268 --> 02:32:26,463
I don't care if it
takes a flying carpet.

1307
02:32:26,671 --> 02:32:29,640
I don't know how this
will be received, general.

1308
02:32:29,840 --> 02:32:32,707
Praying for good weather
so we can kill our fellow man.

1309
02:32:33,010 --> 02:32:36,138
I assure you, because of
my relations with the Almighty...

1310
02:32:36,380 --> 02:32:39,611
...if you write a good prayer,
we'll have good weather.

1311
02:32:39,884 --> 02:32:42,512
And I expect that prayer
within an hour.

1312
02:32:43,321 --> 02:32:44,618
Yes, sir.

1313
02:33:15,252 --> 02:33:18,221
"Almighty and most merciful Father...

1314
02:33:19,090 --> 02:33:21,581
...we humbly beseech Thee...

1315
02:33:21,826 --> 02:33:24,021
...of Thy great goodness...

1316
02:33:24,929 --> 02:33:28,387
...to restrain this
immoderate weather...

1317
02:33:29,667 --> 02:33:31,931
...with which we've had to contend.

1318
02:33:34,105 --> 02:33:37,006
<i>Grant us fair weather for battle.</i>

1319
02:33:38,075 --> 02:33:39,872
<i>Graciously hearken to us...</i>

1320
02:33:41,012 --> 02:33:43,207
<i>... as soldiers who call upon Thee...</i>

1321
02:33:43,714 --> 02:33:46,182
<i>... that armed with Thy power...</i>

1322
02:33:46,550 --> 02:33:49,519
<i>... we may advance</i>
<i>from victory to victory...</i>

1323
02:33:49,754 --> 02:33:52,086
<i>... and crush the oppression...</i>

1324
02:33:52,356 --> 02:33:54,916
<i>... and wickedness of our enemies...</i>

1325
02:33:55,126 --> 02:33:57,390
<i>... and establish Thy justice...</i>

1326
02:33:58,262 --> 02:34:01,561
<i>... among men and nations.</i>

1327
02:34:04,935 --> 02:34:06,197
<i>Amen. "</i>

1328
02:34:21,619 --> 02:34:23,109
Weather's perfect.

1329
02:34:24,388 --> 02:34:27,255
Cod, get me that chaplain.

1330
02:34:27,458 --> 02:34:30,484
He's in good with the Lord
and I want to decorate him.

1331
02:34:58,089 --> 02:35:00,489
Hiya, general!

1332
02:35:38,362 --> 02:35:40,956
<i>Supported by medium bombers</i>
<i>and fighter bombers...</i>

1333
02:35:41,232 --> 02:35:43,723
<i>... flying sorties</i>
<i>against German positions...</i>

1334
02:35:44,001 --> 02:35:45,628
<i>... elements of the 3rd Army...</i>

1335
02:35:45,836 --> 02:35:48,464
<i>... spearheaded by the</i>
<i>4th Armored Division...</i>

1336
02:35:48,706 --> 02:35:50,196
<i>... drive into Bastogne...</i>

1337
02:35:50,474 --> 02:35:52,908
<i>... to relieve its 18,000 defenders...</i>

1338
02:35:53,144 --> 02:35:54,805
<i>... on the day after Christmas.</i>

1339
02:35:55,980 --> 02:35:59,211
<i>During this operation,</i>
<i>3rd Army moved farther and faster...</i>

1340
02:35:59,483 --> 02:36:01,883
<i>... and engaged more divisions</i>
<i>in less time...</i>

1341
02:36:02,153 --> 02:36:05,850
<i>... than any other army in the history</i>
<i>of the United States.</i>

1342
02:39:21,552 --> 02:39:23,179
Excuse me, sir.

1343
02:39:23,454 --> 02:39:26,184
General Katkov would like to know
if you'll join him...

1344
02:39:26,423 --> 02:39:29,187
...to drink to the surrender
of Germany.

1345
02:39:29,460 --> 02:39:31,792
My compliments to the general.

1346
02:39:32,062 --> 02:39:35,225
Please inform him that I do not care
to drink with him...

1347
02:39:35,432 --> 02:39:38,196
...or any other Russian
son of a bitch.

1348
02:39:38,635 --> 02:39:40,865
Sir...

1349
02:39:41,071 --> 02:39:42,902
...I cannot tell the general that.

1350
02:39:44,408 --> 02:39:45,875
You tell him that.

1351
02:39:46,143 --> 02:39:47,735
Tell him word for word.

1352
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,764
The general says he thinks that...

1353
02:40:13,003 --> 02:40:14,903
...you are a son of a bitch too.

1354
02:40:20,477 --> 02:40:23,503
Okay. I'll drink to that.

1355
02:40:23,781 --> 02:40:25,510
One son of a bitch to another.

1356
02:41:08,058 --> 02:41:10,458
Is it true that Roosevelt,
before he died...

1357
02:41:10,727 --> 02:41:12,888
...promised you
a command in the Pacific?

1358
02:41:13,130 --> 02:41:17,863
Yes. But now that he's gone, I don't
think there's much chance of that.

1359
02:41:18,168 --> 02:41:20,329
Doug MacArthur
doesn't want me up there.

1360
02:41:20,537 --> 02:41:23,700
We're told of "wonder weapons"
the Germans were working on:

1361
02:41:23,974 --> 02:41:26,408
Long-range rockets,
push-button bombing...

1362
02:41:26,643 --> 02:41:29,077
...weapons that don't need soldiers.

1363
02:41:29,413 --> 02:41:30,812
"Wonder weapon"?

1364
02:41:31,715 --> 02:41:34,149
My God, I don't see
the wonder in them.

1365
02:41:34,751 --> 02:41:38,915
Killing without heroics. Nothing
is glorified, nothing is reaffirmed.

1366
02:41:39,523 --> 02:41:43,050
No heroes, no cowards, no troops.

1367
02:41:43,260 --> 02:41:44,921
No generals.

1368
02:41:45,662 --> 02:41:48,893
Only those that are left alive
and those that are left...

1369
02:41:49,199 --> 02:41:50,564
...dead.

1370
02:41:51,001 --> 02:41:52,866
I'm glad I won't live to see it.

1371
02:41:53,070 --> 02:41:56,767
It's said you're still using
former Nazis in key positions.

1372
02:41:57,007 --> 02:41:59,168
Despite the denazification policy.

1373
02:41:59,409 --> 02:42:02,435
Well, if I'm supplied
with trained personnel...

1374
02:42:02,679 --> 02:42:04,340
...I'll get rid of the Nazis.

1375
02:42:04,581 --> 02:42:08,540
Until then, I'll use them to keep
the railroads and telephones working.

1376
02:42:08,785 --> 02:42:12,084
After all, didn't most
ordinary Nazis join the Party...

1377
02:42:12,356 --> 02:42:16,622
...in about the same way Americans
become Republicans or Democrats?

1378
02:42:17,027 --> 02:42:18,426
Yes, that's about it.

1379
02:42:21,899 --> 02:42:26,529
You agree that national policy be made
by civilians, not by the military?

1380
02:42:27,104 --> 02:42:30,130
Of course. But the politicians
never let us finish.

1381
02:42:30,374 --> 02:42:33,537
They always stop short and leave us
with another war.

1382
02:42:34,378 --> 02:42:36,642
You thinking about our Russian allies?

1383
02:42:41,652 --> 02:42:45,645
Did you say if you found your army
between the Germans and the Russians...

1384
02:42:45,889 --> 02:42:47,789
...you'd attack in both directions?

1385
02:42:47,991 --> 02:42:50,221
No, I never said that.

1386
02:42:51,061 --> 02:42:52,722
I never said any such thing.

1387
02:42:53,330 --> 02:42:55,264
But I wish I had.

1388
02:43:09,513 --> 02:43:13,574
Sir, there's a call on your line from
supreme headquarters, General Smith.

1389
02:43:20,524 --> 02:43:22,355
Ike is furious.

1390
02:43:22,593 --> 02:43:27,155
How could you compare Republicans
and Democrats to the Nazi Party?

1391
02:43:27,431 --> 02:43:29,592
And the statement
that you refuse to denazify...

1392
02:43:29,800 --> 02:43:32,530
...has the Russians, the British,
everybody, screaming.

1393
02:43:32,970 --> 02:43:35,700
Well, the hell
with the Mongoloid Russians.

1394
02:43:35,939 --> 02:43:38,965
We've given them Berlin, Prague,
God knows what else.

1395
02:43:39,176 --> 02:43:41,041
They gonna dictate policy too?

1396
02:43:41,278 --> 02:43:43,439
George, don't be a fool.

1397
02:43:43,680 --> 02:43:46,979
The war in Europe is over.
Washington dictates policy.

1398
02:43:47,217 --> 02:43:51,654
The war shouldn't be over. We should
stop pussyfooting about the Russians!

1399
02:43:51,888 --> 02:43:55,790
We'll have to fight them anyway. Why
not do it now, when the army's here?

1400
02:43:56,293 --> 02:43:59,956
Instead of disarming Germans let's
get them to help fight the Bolsheviks.

1401
02:44:00,497 --> 02:44:02,965
You better shut up.
This line may be tapped.

1402
02:44:03,166 --> 02:44:04,895
I don't care. I'll tell you...

1403
02:44:05,135 --> 02:44:07,194
...we've been fighting
the wrong people.

1404
02:44:07,471 --> 02:44:10,963
You and Ike don't have to get involved,
you're so soft about it.

1405
02:44:11,208 --> 02:44:14,507
Leave it to me. In 10 days
I'll have us at war with them...

1406
02:44:14,711 --> 02:44:16,576
...and make it look like their fault!

1407
02:44:17,047 --> 02:44:20,312
George, you're mad.
You're absolutely out of your mind!

1408
02:44:20,550 --> 02:44:22,211
Well, I'm no diplomat.

1409
02:44:22,486 --> 02:44:25,148
I'm a combat soldier.
That's all they understand.

1410
02:44:25,389 --> 02:44:29,155
Get Ike to give me the word,
and I'll kick them back to Russia!

1411
02:44:38,735 --> 02:44:40,930
Shall I call the artist back, sir?

1412
02:44:42,673 --> 02:44:44,732
Oh, the hell with it.

1413
02:44:46,376 --> 02:44:49,937
Nobody wants to see a picture of me.
I'm mad!

1414
02:44:50,914 --> 02:44:52,404
Don't you know that?

1415
02:45:39,563 --> 02:45:42,498
Field Marshal Montgomery,
his majesty is prepared...

1416
02:45:42,766 --> 02:45:46,224
...to receive the next chief
of the imperial general staff.

1417
02:45:59,249 --> 02:46:00,807
Thank you.

1418
02:46:01,785 --> 02:46:03,309
Thank you.

1419
02:46:04,020 --> 02:46:05,647
Take care of yourself.

1420
02:46:05,856 --> 02:46:07,118
George.

1421
02:46:20,270 --> 02:46:23,137
Well, gentlemen...

1422
02:46:24,841 --> 02:46:28,140
...all good things
must come to an end.

1423
02:46:30,514 --> 02:46:33,347
And the best thing
that's happened to me...

1424
02:46:34,217 --> 02:46:35,844
...in my life...

1425
02:46:37,788 --> 02:46:39,813
...has been...

1426
02:46:44,995 --> 02:46:46,724
...the honor...

1427
02:46:47,197 --> 02:46:50,223
...and privilege...

1428
02:46:52,469 --> 02:46:54,630
...of commanding the 3rd Army.

1429
02:46:57,407 --> 02:46:58,704
Goodbye...

1430
02:46:59,910 --> 02:47:01,502
...and God bless you.

1431
02:47:28,171 --> 02:47:30,071
Brad...

1432
02:47:30,407 --> 02:47:32,898
...they've taken the 3rd Army
away from me.

1433
02:47:33,176 --> 02:47:34,438
I know.

1434
02:47:35,078 --> 02:47:38,013
I thought we could have dinner
together tonight.

1435
02:47:39,749 --> 02:47:42,718
Thank you, Brad.

1436
02:47:42,953 --> 02:47:45,285
That's damn thoughtful.
I appreciate it.

1437
02:47:52,696 --> 02:47:55,256
Right now, I think I'll take
Willy for a walk.

1438
02:48:02,639 --> 02:48:04,539
George, look out!

1439
02:48:12,048 --> 02:48:14,380
After all I've been through...

1440
02:48:14,651 --> 02:48:17,313
...imagine getting killed
by an oxcart.

1441
02:48:18,755 --> 02:48:23,385
No, Brad, there's only one proper way
for a professional soldier to die.

1442
02:48:23,627 --> 02:48:27,620
That's from the last bullet
of the last battle of the last war.

1443
02:48:28,765 --> 02:48:32,064
At least the 3rd Army earned its pay.

1444
02:48:32,903 --> 02:48:35,565
In our drive across Europe,
we liberated...

1445
02:48:35,839 --> 02:48:37,898
...12,000 cities and towns...

1446
02:48:38,108 --> 02:48:40,941
...and inflicted a million and a half
enemy casualties.

1447
02:48:41,244 --> 02:48:44,941
I sense from now on, just being
a good soldier won't mean a thing.

1448
02:48:45,248 --> 02:48:49,981
I'm afraid we're gonna have to be
diplomats, administrators, you name it.

1449
02:48:50,253 --> 02:48:51,845
God help us.

1450
02:48:57,027 --> 02:49:00,190
George, I want to say one thing.

1451
02:49:01,498 --> 02:49:04,331
You've done a magnificent job
here in Europe.

1452
02:49:05,035 --> 02:49:06,525
That's right, George.

1453
02:49:07,370 --> 02:49:12,501
That soldier you slapped did more to
win the war than any other private.

1454
02:49:15,545 --> 02:49:17,274
I'll see you for dinner.

1455
02:49:17,647 --> 02:49:19,137
Six-thirty?

1456
02:49:35,665 --> 02:49:37,394
<i>For over a thousand years...</i>

1457
02:49:37,667 --> 02:49:40,693
<i>... Roman conquerors</i>
<i>returning from the wars...</i>

1458
02:49:40,904 --> 02:49:45,637
<i>... enjoyed the honor of a triumph,</i>
<i>a tumultuous parade.</i>

1459
02:49:46,476 --> 02:49:50,537
<i>In the procession came trumpeters</i>
<i>and musicians and strange animals...</i>

1460
02:49:50,814 --> 02:49:52,714
<i>... from the conquered territories...</i>

1461
02:49:53,583 --> 02:49:57,713
<i>... together with carts laden with</i>
<i>treasure and captured armaments.</i>

1462
02:49:58,989 --> 02:50:02,550
<i>The conqueror rode</i>
<i>in a triumphal chariot...</i>

1463
02:50:02,759 --> 02:50:06,058
<i>... the dazed prisoners</i>
<i>walking in chains before him.</i>

1464
02:50:06,997 --> 02:50:09,727
<i>Sometimes, his children,</i>
<i>robed in white...</i>

1465
02:50:10,033 --> 02:50:13,525
<i>... stood with him in the chariot,</i>
<i>or rode the trace horses.</i>

1466
02:50:14,604 --> 02:50:17,573
<i>A slave stood behind the conqueror...</i>

1467
02:50:17,841 --> 02:50:20,435
<i>... holding a golden crown...</i>

1468
02:50:21,177 --> 02:50:24,010
<i>... and whispering in his ear</i>
<i>a warning...</i>

1469
02:50:24,614 --> 02:50:26,514
<i>... that all glory...</i>

1470
02:50:27,017 --> 02:50:28,848
<i>... is fleeting.</i>

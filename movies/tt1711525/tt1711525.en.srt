2
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,995
Are you kidding me?

3
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,272
Oh, Josh!
Sorry I'm late.

4
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,794
That's all right.

5
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,632
Office holiday breakfast.

6
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,496
You guys have parties
at 10:30 in the morning?

7
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,748
Less liability.

8
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,376
Apparently, people don't
get drunk before noon.

9
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,595
- Mmm.
- It's boring as shit.

10
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,631
But the partners
want us there, so...

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,954
Sure.

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,837
Anyways,
after a year of negotiation,

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,109
your divorce is finalised.

14
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,312
These are the terms
we agreed to.

15
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,959
The alimony,

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,952
the house. Sorry.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,956
Don't worry about it.
It's only money.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,638
It is only

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,158
all of the money.

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,911
But it's the season
for giving, right?

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,518
I know how you feel.

22
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,711
Oh, yeah? I didn't know
you were divorced.

23
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,592
Oh, God, no.
That'd be crushing.

24
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,955
- Hmm.
- But I get it.

25
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,957
On one level,
it must seem like, uh,

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,991
"I'm signing away
a huge chunk of my life

27
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,792
"that I'm never getting back."

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,955
Mmm-hmm.

29
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,552
That's it? No other level?

30
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,916
- No, that's it. Uh, initials.
- Oh.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,956
Hey. There are good things
ahead for you, okay?

32
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,513
- Yeah. Oh.
- Come here.

33
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,751
- Thank you. Thanks, buddy.
- Merry Christmas.

34
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,951
- Hey, what's this?
- My final bill's in there.

35
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,951
- Is it?
- Oh, also my holiday card.

36
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,752
The wife had me
and the kids dress up

37
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,717
like members of One Direction.
Pretty fun.

38
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,951
Mmm. Dynamite.

39
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,953
Yes, Mum, it is all done.
I am divorced.

40
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,518
Well, you should tell Dad

41
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,989
that she is not coming over
for Christmas.

42
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,959
Why?
Because we're divorced, Mum!

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,070
Well... Oh, Mum,
don't worry about that.

44
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,354
I'm still gonna be fun.

45
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,598
I'm still gonna be
fun Uncle Josh, you know?

46
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,151
Well, without doing that.

47
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,794
No, you can leave
the Santa suit in the attic.

48
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,193
Why? Because I'm an adult

49
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,550
and dressing up as Santa Claus
would be embarrassing.

50
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,191
Hi. Unless, you know,
you're doing it for charity.

51
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,318
Then it's... Then it's, um...

52
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,549
Sorry.

53
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,119
Tell Dad that I love... Oh!

54
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,599
That's lucky.

55
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,756
Just put me down
for five bucks, okay?

56
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
Hanging up, Mum.

57
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,359
Hey, Carla, good morning.

58
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,256
You see something over there?
What do you got?

59
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,315
I think that Starbucks

60
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,936
- attracts a bad element, Josh.
- Oh, yeah.

61
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,518
Listen.
Give me the green light...

62
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,776
- Mmm-hmm.
- ...and I'll shut it down.

63
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,836
Oh, I love that initiative.
It's awesome.

64
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,712
Could you sign me in
real quick, please?

65
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,496
I wish I could,
but they got us sending you

66
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,078
through these machines now.

67
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,748
Gonna replace my ass,
matter of time.

68
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,955
That's never gonna happen.

69
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,616
These machines
don't have your smile, Carla.

70
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,312
Make that money!

71
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,518
Josh, we have a situation.

72
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,950
Mary!
How do you always just appear?

73
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,160
You're like a human pop-up ad.

74
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,919
Did you read my latest memo
on appropriate work dress?

75
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,712
Uh, almost done.
Don't ruin the end.

76
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,080
Well, some people didn't.
And those people are Meghan.

77
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,597
Nobody listens to H.R.

78
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,954
Hey, Meghan?

79
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,957
I thought
that I have been clear about

80
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,152
the number of buttons that
can be unbuttoned on a shirt.

81
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,954
- You were serious about that?
- It's winter. Can we

82
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,355
put Dancer and Prancer
back in their stable?

83
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,079
Are you body-shaming her
right now?

84
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,077
Some people here

85
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,272
might find your outfit

86
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,634
offensive.

87
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,955
Well, some people might
find your outfit offensive.

88
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,359
And really confusing.

89
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,600
Oh, I thought it was clear.

90
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,154
This is a multi-denominational
holiday sweater.

91
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,793
It has Christmas,

92
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,916
Hanukkah, Kwanzaa,

93
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,718
the Buddhist day
of enlightenment,

94
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,519
and Boxing Day on it.
Everyone's included!

95
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,119
Is everyone included?

96
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,760
What about, um, what about
something for the Satanists?

97
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,952
Jeremy, come on. I... I admire
the stand that you're taking,

98
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,718
but let's schedule
the protest rally

99
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,936
for after the workday,
shall we?

100
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,536
And, Mary, let's let it slide.

101
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,834
Thank you.

102
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,188
Good morning, everybody.

103
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,076
You can't silence us all.

104
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,950
I know why
you took a medical leave.

105
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,136
It's hard for me
to bring her out in public

106
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,275
because she's so beautiful.

107
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,588
Hey, guys.

108
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,951
People put models
on this crazy pedestal, but

109
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,349
I think that's why, you know,
Becca fell for me,

110
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,954
because I just treat her
like a normal person.

111
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,160
Good for you, man.
Hey, so, um, are you gonna be

112
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,794
inviting your fake girlfriend
to the holiday party later?

113
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,096
I mean, I just want to
make sure you have time

114
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,348
to inflate her.

115
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,589
Okay, Becca's real.

116
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,790
And we're not gonna mix
business with pleasure.

117
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,512
Sounds like
he didn't invite her, dude.

118
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,794
Oh, my God, did you not...

119
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,349
Oh, no! I mean, I hope
she's not imaginary pissed.

120
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,056
You won't get any more
imaginary blow jobs.

121
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,274
Right?

122
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,628
Tim. Drew.

123
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,376
Hey, it's a couple days
before Christmas.

124
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,400
Let's just try to keep it
positive till then, okay?

125
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,096
- We're totally positive.
- No, we're all about...

126
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,951
Totally positive
that he is full of shit.

127
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,154
Hey...

128
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,398
You bring it on yourself,
Nate.

129
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,776
You know,
I do have a girlfriend.

130
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,835
I know.

131
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,951
She's a human woman,
and we've done it.

132
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,536
Maybe just don't talk
about her so much at work.

133
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,936
It's just gonna make
those guys jealous.

134
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,440
You know, not only
are you their boss,

135
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,953
but you also have
a hot girlfriend.

136
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,995
You know?

137
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,156
- It's too much. I hate you.
- Yeah.

138
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,952
- Have a good day.
- You, too!

139
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,936
Can you believe
corporate raised the price

140
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,188
in the vending machine again?

141
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,548
$2 for ginger ale?

142
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,951
They're trying
to crush us like ants!

143
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,198
No, there's a lot of
bad energy in this office.

144
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,952
Yo, Josh, what the fuck?

145
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,359
What the fuck, Tracey?

146
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,954
You changed the security code
without telling me?

147
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,176
Yeah, I'm working
on sensitive shit,

148
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,599
and I don't want prying eyes.

149
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,597
I'm prying eyes?
I'm your supervisor.

150
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,349
Chief technical officer,
lead systems engineer.

151
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,953
Yeah, well, I'm the only one
who knows

152
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,791
how to hack
the security panel, so

153
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,791
suck my dick.

154
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,955
Nice. Okay.

155
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
What are you working on?

156
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,957
Oh, it's too complicated
to explain.

157
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,634
What is that, subroutine
for duplex compression?

158
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,951
Don't tell me
that's what I think it is.

159
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,599
This is the future of Zenotek.

160
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,240
Hey, we should pitch this
to Data City!

161
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,753
That's a theory.

162
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,956
You want to peg
the company to a theory?

163
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,271
Man, you used to get excited
by big ideas.

164
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,954
Now you just bunt, and ask for
the same thing over and over.

165
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,109
I swing for the fences.

166
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,589
And I'm going to change
the fucking game.

167
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,960
Okay. I need the specs for
the Data City pitch, please.

168
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,078
Already done. Here.

169
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,753
Great. That was fast.

170
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,153
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

171
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,952
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

172
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,960
Really? Because you seem

173
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,616
a little off today.
You seem a little weird.

174
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,789
- Well...
- Oh, my gosh!

175
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,956
Today is the day, right? Hey!

176
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,918
Congratulations, you're free!

177
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,076
You gonna get a back tattoo
and some skinny jeans?

178
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,920
Funds are a little tight,
but...

179
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
It feels good to be free.

180
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,274
Yeah.

181
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,952
All right. Thank you for this.

182
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,319
- Hey, J.
- Yeah?

183
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,391
I got you
for Secret Santa again.

184
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,951
I know. I got you, too.

185
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,196
Oh, sweetie, that is so great!
Mummy's so proud of you.

186
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,959
Hey, could you put
your daddy back

187
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,000
on the phone for a second?

188
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,634
- Hey, Allison. Is he ready?
- You fucking motherfucker!

189
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,558
If I hear you let
your stripper girlfriend

190
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,751
put my children on her
motorcycle one more time

191
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,632
I will Gone Girl you so hard!

192
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,000
- You can go in.
- I'll just go in. Thank you.

193
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,136
No, no, no.
Don't try and sell this

194
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,309
as some win-win situation.

195
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,840
This is not
my first rodeo, okay?

196
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,919
- Is that Data City?
- No.

197
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,995
No.

198
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,758
Rick, do you want
this deal or not?

199
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,955
Because if you want him,

200
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,949
you're gonna
have to pay for him.

201
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,995
It's almost the playoffs,

202
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,838
not the second week
of the regular season.

203
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,836
Perfect.
It's the right choice.

204
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,712
I am running a train
on this league.

205
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,949
I... I don't think that
that means

206
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
what you want it to mean.

207
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,480
I'd love to talk to you
about the Data City pitch,

208
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,640
for later on this afternoon?

209
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,600
Yes, but first I want
your opinion on something.

210
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,834
We've got kind of a crisis.

211
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,951
This is what corporate
wants us to give

212
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,752
everyone for Christmas.
Just this.

213
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,518
Yeah, can't hand that out.

214
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,518
And I'm already
feeling kind of a

215
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,599
"fuck you" vibe down there,

216
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,960
definitely not
Christmas spirit.

217
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,513
I can't argue with you there.

218
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,358
Good. I want to
Secret Santa the shit

219
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,953
out of the staff meeting.
Come on.

220
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,158
Can we work and walk?

221
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,951
You're not cold
without a big coat on?

222
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,712
No, I gain fifteen pounds
every winter

223
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,949
so I don't have to wear one.

224
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,514
- Huh. That's a healthy choice.
- Not really.

225
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,280
Hey, are you bringing anybody
to this wine and cheese thing?

226
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,919
Uh, no, I'll be there solo.

227
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,713
Good. Smart. So you can
focus on Tracey, right?

228
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,914
Tracey and I work together.
What are you talking about?

229
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,190
I'm just saying. I can't be
your work wife forever.

230
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,936
Hey, how fast do you think
you'd have to go

231
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,552
- to make that jump?
- Uh...

232
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,056
- Boy, I don't know. In a car?
- Yeah.

233
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,957
I just never
thought about that.

234
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,991
You know,
your mind's like a drunk baby.

235
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,240
What do you think, 80 or 90?

236
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,754
What would Vin do? Vin Diesel?
Or Tyrese?

237
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,758
They'd never make it, right?
It's suicide. Unless

238
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,576
you were going 120, you put
a bunch of free weights

239
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,080
in the trunk to even it out,
you know,

240
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,951
then you just catch air.
Boosh!

241
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,110
"Fuck you, gravity,
and you, Dom Toretto!"

242
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,315
Then...

243
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,880
...just a smooth landing,
like a baby's buttocks.

244
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,951
I'd love to pick
this up indoors.

245
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,816
You know, I've only ever seen
the first film,

246
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,955
so I don't know
if I'm much help to you

247
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,109
in this conversation. So...

248
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,136
Are you serious? Why am I
just hearing about this?

249
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,536
We've worked together
for eight years.

250
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,994
They only get more fast!
More furious!

251
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,958
I love this place.

252
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,192
So, what would people want?
Would they like... Ooh!

253
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,915
Is this UV?
Is UV good or bad? I forget.

254
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,111
Not good for the eyes, no.

255
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,376
Does it do
anything here?

256
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,515
Probably. Is this for

257
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,736
- teeth whitening?
- No.

258
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,751
Okay, what about this, right?

259
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,136
Everybody gets
stressed at work...

260
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,376
...around this time of year.

261
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,515
Huh.

262
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,068
That could get you
a sexual harassment suit.

263
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,195
What? Why?

264
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,958
Not everyone likes dildos
for Christmas.

265
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,195
This isn't a dildo.
It's a body massager.

266
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,709
Yeah, well, it's a circumcised
purple penis.

267
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,074
It could be considered sexual.

268
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,315
Why is it like that?

269
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,391
Everything here
could be considered sexual.

270
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,392
Hey, what about this
for Alan from legal?

271
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,296
Well, Alan's bald.

272
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,896
It's so hard
to shop for the bald.

273
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,160
Who are they?
What do they want?

274
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,829
Hair.

275
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,056
You know, maybe we should just
go get some gift cards.

276
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,559
That's exactly
what we should do!

277
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,954
"Here's a gift card
because I don't know you

278
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,110
"and I don't care and I won't
get in trouble for it."

279
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,576
You know,
when my dad ran this company,

280
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,318
Christmas was
actually a big deal.

281
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,880
At the Christmas party
every year,

282
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,955
he would dress up
like Santa Claus,

283
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,757
get everybody fucked up.

284
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,949
Yeah, you could back then.

285
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,791
He would throw gifts
into the crowd.

286
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,952
Derek Peterson shattered his
femur for a rotisserie set.

287
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,080
And that was before Boston
Chicken was, like, a thing.

288
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
- I've heard those stories.
- He took care of them.

289
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,399
That's what I want
for my people. You know?

290
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,193
And I want that drone.

291
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,992
Clay, let me ask you
a question.

292
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,637
You think that my management
style is... Is too careful?

293
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,110
Uh, do you think that I bunt

294
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,952
instead of swing
for the fences?

295
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,111
I want to be completely honest
with you, Josh.

296
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,601
I wasn't paying attention, so
I didn't hear your question.

297
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,440
- I can repeat it.
- I'd rather you didn't.

298
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,915
Because I can tell by
your face that it's serious.

299
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,632
And I want
to tell you seriously,

300
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,956
it's almost Christmas. Relax.

301
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,758
- You want some of this?
- I think so.

302
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,296
- I don't think you do.
- You sure?

303
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,520
I think you better get moving.

304
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,754
Uh-oh. Here he goes!

305
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,193
Huh?

306
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,390
Eat that! Eat it, Clay!

307
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,240
Careful, careful, careful!

308
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,917
We're good.

309
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,514
Oh, no!

310
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,835
Oh...

311
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,710
Hey!

312
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,076
Ooh, somebody
is getting fired.

313
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,150
Hey, uh, Allison? Right?

314
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,919
- Yeah.
- I'm Fred.

315
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,960
I just joined accounting.

316
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,589
Hi.

317
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,518
Um, so, I saw
that photo on your desk.

318
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,715
Are those your kids?

319
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,916
- Yep. They're two and four.
- Oh.

320
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,712
I'm a single mum. Ugh.

321
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,149
That's great.

322
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,589
- I was raised by a single mum.
- Really?

323
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,240
Yeah. If you ask me,
Tupac was right.

324
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,696
"Ain't a woman alive

325
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,358
"that could take
my mama's place."

326
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,793
I don't know that song.

327
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,554
Oh, shit.

328
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,354
Allison.

329
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,280
- Where's Clay?
- He's unreachable.

330
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,989
He's participating
in a conference... Summit...

331
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,958
Elon Musk, uh,

332
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,840
tech participation... Relay.

333
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,399
Let's try that again.

334
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,959
Allison, where's Clay?

335
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,957
- He's Christmas shopping.
- Okay.

336
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,839
I would like
all department heads

337
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,837
in the conference room
in five minutes.

338
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,736
Tell him to stop
looking at me.

339
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,795
Look away.

340
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,957
Ooh. No, he's cute. Oh.

341
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,389
Actually...

342
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,710
It's like the calling
never stops.

343
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,512
I know.
It's so annoying.

344
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,992
Ugh! You have
got to be shitting me.

345
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,119
So the bartender says,

346
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,936
"We don't see many gorillas."
And the gorilla says,

347
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,394
"Well, at $12 for a martini
I can see why not."

348
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,959
You know a lot
of gorilla jokes.

349
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,110
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

350
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,994
What's going on?
Something's off.

351
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,958
Yeah, everyone's working.

352
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,153
Oh, shitster.

353
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,953
It's my sister.

354
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,949
There she is!
My sister from another mister!

355
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,319
I'm kidding, our mother

356
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,696
didn't start having affairs
until the mid-90s.

357
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,755
What are you doing here?

358
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,758
Well, we were just going over
your fourth quarter earnings.

359
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,496
And I wondered
if I was missing something.

360
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,748
Probably.

361
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,911
Clay, why don't you
have a seat?

362
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,189
Uh, no. It's my branch,
so I prefer to stand.

363
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,909
Fine.

364
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,958
Allison, would you please
remove Clay's chair?

365
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,560
- Uh, sure.
- Thank you.

366
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
Sorry.

367
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,954
Thank you, Allison.

368
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,952
So we were all
a little bit disappointed

369
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,196
not to hit 7% growth
in this last quarter.

370
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,392
But 6.5% is right on industry
standard for the fall.

371
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,951
Mmm-mmm. You need to hit 12%.

372
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,311
- Twelve?
- Twelve is the new seven.

373
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,629
- What?
- Since when?

374
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,079
Since Dad died

375
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,832
and the board made me CEO.

376
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,951
Oh. You mean interim CEO.

377
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,153
Shut up. Listen, essentially,
this branch is failing.

378
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,958
6.5% is not failing.

379
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,115
Yes, it is.

380
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,376
We're doing
better than Orlando.

381
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,959
I mean, half those jack-offs
had mono last year, right?

382
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,958
Well, I closed the
Orlando branch. This morning.

383
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,189
What?

384
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,314
I am sorry.

385
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,752
Damn it.
I hate tension, and I...

386
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,315
I farted.

387
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,595
- Wow.
- You are not

388
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,948
selling enough servers.

389
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,950
You have no new ideas
and there is no new revenue.

390
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,197
- I have something new.
- Really?

391
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,958
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

392
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,896
- It's not ready.
- It is ready.

393
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,512
- It's not ready.
- It is ready.

394
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,948
- Uh, we can hear you.
- Yeah, sorry.

395
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,951
We can.
It's a completely silent room.

396
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,354
Go ahead.

397
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,790
What's the most annoying thing
about the Internet?

398
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,919
- Pictures of people's kids.
- Linkedln invites.

399
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,110
My girlfriend's always on it.
I have a girlfriend.

400
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,959
The lack of Asian
male representation in porn.

401
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,116
Grumpy Cat.
It's like... It's Garfield.

402
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,390
Oh, you know that orange
with the human dick?

403
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,959
Oh, my God,
what is this, Shark Tank?

404
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,440
Can you just get
to the point, please?

405
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,388
- It's getting on the Internet.
- Mmm.

406
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,776
So we can already
connect to the Internet

407
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,949
through standard
electrical lines

408
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,837
and obviously we can do it
through the air.

409
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,998
But what if we could combine
those technologies?

410
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,078
With Zenotek AnywAir,

411
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,536
you can pull
the Internet wirelessly

412
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,835
from anything that's connected
to a power grid.

413
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,313
Your appliances.
Street lights. A light bulb.

414
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,957
You're never out of range, and
you're never low on signal.

415
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,798
It's AnywAir.

416
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,359
We're in the future.

417
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,598
And you can deliver that?

418
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,189
I'm still figuring out
some coding issues, but yes.

419
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,956
Well, how long
have you been figuring?

420
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,951
- Four years.
- Four years?

421
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,390
All right, well, that doesn't
sound very real to me.

422
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,710
Well, if it was real,
I wouldn't have to invent it.

423
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,119
I'm sorry,

424
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,111
- what's your name again?
- Tracey Hughes.

425
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,315
And if you forget again,

426
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,200
it's on all of the recent
patents for Zenotek.

427
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,069
Mmm-hmm.

428
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,388
You know what? I'm gonna sit.

429
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,313
Not because you told me to,
but because I

430
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,109
prefer it.

431
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,189
So...

432
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,755
Mmm-hmm.

433
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,758
- Is there anything else?
- Actually, yes.

434
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,999
This is a sample cheeseboard
for our holiday mixer tonight.

435
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,040
I know it's a little heavy
on the Gouda...

436
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,633
That was the MVP last year.

437
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,956
Uh, I do have a feisty Cheddar
on the bench.

438
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,200
I think that pairs better with

439
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,953
the mulled non-alcoholic wine
myself, but what do I know?

440
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,558
Wait, wait. I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

441
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,176
You're having
a Christmas party tonight?

442
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,553
Oh, it's not
a Christmas party!

443
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,200
It's a non-denominational
holiday mixer.

444
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,629
More inclusive.

445
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,150
Well, whatever the fuck it is,
it's not happening.

446
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,360
Yeah, it's definitely...
Well, it's not "happenin"'

447
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,320
because it happens
at 5:30 in the afternoon.

448
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,509
It's just a small thing

449
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,136
that's really important
to all of us, but

450
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,515
trust me, it's gonna suck.

451
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,068
No, it's not gonna suck,
because it's cancelled.

452
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,514
What?

453
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,511
All branch Christmas parties
are cancelled.

454
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,635
It's a waste of money!

455
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,751
Come on.
What are you guys not getting?

456
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,837
All right, it's cancelled.

457
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,115
It's not.

458
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,391
Clay! I mean it.

459
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,312
Me, too, Carol. Guys,

460
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,816
the holiday mixer
is cancelled.

461
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,909
Yes.

462
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,391
Hey! It's cancelled, Clay!

463
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,959
The thing is not happening
at all.

464
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,096
I'm not messing
with you.

465
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,633
Hey! Stop doing that!

466
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,990
Hey, idiot,
I'm looking right at you.

467
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,949
I saw that! You whispered
to the farty cheese lady.

468
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,995
Well...

469
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,550
Don't make me pull rank, Clay.

470
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,154
It is cancelled.

471
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,759
Fine!

472
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,115
Then this meeting
is cancelled! Huh?

473
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,712
Damn it!

474
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,798
I was keeping it light
in there.

475
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,955
That was light, huh?

476
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,957
You have to give her a break,
Josh. She's hated parties

477
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,960
ever since she started
not getting invited to them.

478
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,515
Please. That party's the least
of your problems.

479
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,189
Is that Dad?

480
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,277
No, Carol, I just have
some random guy's

481
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,839
ashes in my office.

482
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
Got it online.

483
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,072
Yes. He wanted them here,
with me, at his branch.

484
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,710
I thought they were gonna
divide him equally.

485
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,936
It's not my fault
that he always liked

486
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,949
hanging out with me more.

487
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,951
I don't care.
I got this company.

488
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,519
Moving on.

489
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,791
We have a lot of
big cuts to make. Okay?

490
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,070
Obviously, bonuses
are cancelled.

491
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,956
You know,
there's a lot of people that

492
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,393
are relying on those bonuses.

493
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,835
I suppose you're still
getting your bonus, though.

494
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,951
Secondly, I'm laying off
40% of your staff.

495
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,393
Forty?

496
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,951
Forty? We have 200 employees.
That's like, 60...

497
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,596
- Some...
- That's 80. It's 80.

498
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,592
Eighty. That's, like,
80 employees.

499
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,789
Uh, you got to give us

500
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,955
a little bit of time
to turn this around.

501
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,880
Fine, then you have until
the end of the quarter.

502
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,718
- That's two days.
- Is it? Oh, well.

503
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,069
This is unfair.

504
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,514
You wanna talk unfair?

505
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,636
How about Dad skipping
my Harvard graduation

506
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,960
to go with you to the X Games?

507
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,593
And you weren't even
competing.

508
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,790
You just sponsored
some guy's wakeboard.

509
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,315
He got the bronze.
Which is brown gold.

510
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,776
All right, so I've made a list
of my first round of layoffs.

511
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,920
So you might wanna get a pen

512
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,696
- and start writing these down.
- No. Let me see that.

513
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,948
- No. No.
- Give me that.

514
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,957
- No!
- These are my employees!

515
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,936
Guys, are we sure about this?

516
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,279
Say you won't
make budget cuts.

517
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,395
I swear to God, Clay!

518
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,696
Here comes the loogie express!

519
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,816
- Don't you dare!
- Say, "Everybody's

520
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,840
- "gonna get a bonus," or else.
- You motherfucker.

521
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,758
Suck that back in. You suck
that back in! You mother...

522
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,951
Clay.

523
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,958
Oh, my God!

524
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,752
Why do you do this
to yourself?

525
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,512
You know I took
nine years of Krav Maga.

526
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,637
Carol, you know,
he's turning blue.

527
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,115
Yeah. Our family,
you got to tap out.

528
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,551
Tap out. Tap out.

529
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,311
Okay.

530
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,997
All right. You okay?

531
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,072
Dad gave you a free pass
your entire life,

532
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,991
and you're not
getting one from me.

533
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,976
The only way you're gonna hit
your targets this year

534
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,309
is by cutting jobs.

535
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,960
Hey, what if we landed

536
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,558
the Data City account?

537
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,315
- Data City? Walter Davis?
- That's right.

538
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,630
You do know that
he's already met with HP,

539
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,829
Cisco and Oracle.

540
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,518
Yeah, but he hasn't
heard our pitch.

541
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,749
No.

542
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,956
Josh and I have been
drilling into it for weeks.

543
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,957
Yeah. Months. Whole team.

544
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,399
And we have a meeting

545
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,959
- with him this afternoon.
- Yeah.

546
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,349
All right.

547
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,271
Well, I'm on a flight
to London tonight.

548
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,717
So if by some miracle you guys
can close Walter Davis

549
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,956
and his $14 million contract

550
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,951
by the time
I land at Heathrow,

551
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,633
the jobs are safe.

552
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,955
Done!

553
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,275
And you'll see,
you're gonna look so stupid.

554
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,950
Then we'll finally
have something in common.

555
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,590
Goddamn it! She's so mean!

556
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,839
People are saying "cuts."
What kind of cuts?

557
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,552
Oh, nothing's official.

558
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,896
Guys, I can barely
afford my rent.

559
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,989
I'm sleeping in a closet.

560
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,155
Don't panic.

561
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,376
You can't replace
the new guy, right?

562
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,976
You're probably gonna go
with people that are older,

563
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,176
- more expensive?
- Don't overreact.

564
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,112
I just bought that used Lexus,
Josh. I can't give it back.

565
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,793
I put rims on it, man!

566
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,110
I have six parrots with
very expensive medical issues.

567
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,315
You know this.

568
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,958
I'm gonna have to
put one down.

569
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,837
- Nobody is losing their jobs!
- Yeah.

570
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,554
That is a Josh and Clay
Christmas promise.

571
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,910
Your promises are dog shit!

572
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,554
- Boy, they turned quick.
- Yeah, they sure did.

573
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,920
Jesus. Incest and rape?

574
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,713
I mean, that is dark.

575
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,957
That could be
a different Clay.

576
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,635
And Carol.

577
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,034
We got to land this pitch.

578
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,197
Okay, everybody knows
what we're doing?

579
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,640
Sure. We're just pitching to
save our company. No biggie.

580
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,496
And we're proving that
my sister doesn't fuck me.

581
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,192
- If anything, I fuck her!
- All right.

582
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,960
Yeah, listen, I get
the spirit of that, but...

583
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,151
We at Zenotek put the "client"

584
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,955
in client-server
model service distribution.

585
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,157
And this is a leave-behind.

586
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,313
And we have
some new innovation

587
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,312
that we can talk to you
about later. Later.

588
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,712
You got to...
You got to go with us.

589
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,399
Okay.

590
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,952
Thank you for the pitch.

591
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,392
Just give me a beat, and I'll
let you know my decision.

592
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,913
Okay. When you say "beat,"
you're talking about an hour

593
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,279
or a day? A full day?

594
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,591
Certainly before the holidays,
I'd imagine, right?

595
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,350
Listen, it's Christmas, so,
I'll be honest.

596
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,190
Your servers are good.

597
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,313
Dell's servers are good.

598
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,273
- So...
- You're gonna go with us.

599
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,957
- I'm gonna go with Dell.
- Fuck!

600
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,188
- Why?
- Don't.

601
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,628
I... I know your product.

602
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,955
My problem is
with your culture.

603
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,312
Our culture is great.

604
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,948
That's not what I hear.

605
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,269
Word is you're closing
branches and making layoffs.

606
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,272
- That's not true.
- No, that's barely true.

607
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,999
A mixture of
fabrication and rumour.

608
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,760
Look, I get it.
You got to make money.

609
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,916
And every quarter
you got to make more money.

610
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,399
And if you got to
fire some people

611
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,551
and cut back on some benefits
to make it happen,

612
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,751
that's what business
is now, right?

613
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,996
And as long as the board
has gotten its bonus

614
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,395
and the stock is
ticking up? Come on.

615
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,715
Sir, that's not who we are.

616
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,640
If you came to our offices,
you would see that.

617
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,000
You should come
meet our people.

618
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,520
Yeah, we're a family business.

619
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,840
Everyone loves everyone.

620
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,313
I mean, Clay and his sister,

621
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,960
they're so close
it's almost inappropriate.

622
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,190
We would love the opportunity
to prove you wrong.

623
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,200
I'm sure you have wonderful
cubicles and great carpeting,

624
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,118
but I've done
those tours before.

625
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,959
I'm gonna pass.

626
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,995
Um...

627
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,195
Thank you so much.

628
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,389
Oh, we got that.

629
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,596
Oh, no, they've already put it
on my room.

630
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,936
And in addition
to the breakfast

631
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,269
my company
won't pay for anymore.

632
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,955
Good luck, guys.

633
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,113
Great. That was uplifting.

634
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,315
He's saying we suck.

635
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,958
Our big closer
was a thumb drive.

636
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,960
Yeah, but we don't suck.

637
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,336
We just need a way
to show him that.

638
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,536
How are we gonna do that?
We're gonna

639
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,520
invite him to our cancelled
wine and cheese night?

640
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,073
No, we should take him out
for real.

641
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,376
I mean, you heard him.
His company

642
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,799
won't even buy him breakfast.

643
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,951
He's an old school guy
who drinks scotch at lunch.

644
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,510
We should take him out
and show him a great time.

645
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,936
So we'll hook him up
with Don Draper,

646
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,896
then go out and get
a couple of steaks and an STD.

647
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,911
No, no, no.
You're both right.

648
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,949
We show him a great time

649
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,951
at our office
Christmas party tonight.

650
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,319
What? I didn't say that.

651
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,959
- It's not the worst idea.
- Right?

652
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,176
Of course it is.
We don't even have

653
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,269
an office Christmas party.

654
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,080
Carol said no
to all discretionary spending.

655
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,951
She wants to lay off 40%.
You want to double that?

656
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,552
My sister doesn't do anything
at 40%.

657
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,896
She's just
cutting off our legs

658
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,955
so we can't run away when she

659
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,400
wants to fucking
curb-stomp our face.

660
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,198
This is the way
we close Walter.

661
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,440
We throw the best Christmas
party he's ever been to.

662
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,755
He loves it, he loves us,
he sees we care about people,

663
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,955
he falls in love
with our culture,

664
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,995
he wants to work with us.

665
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,191
This is how
we save everybody's job!

666
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,197
I like it, Josh. Say yes.

667
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,396
He's walking away,
unless you have a better idea.

668
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,000
That's your approval sigh.

669
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,954
Walter?

670
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,358
We have one more
pitch for you.

671
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,555
Do you party?

672
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,188
I used to.

673
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,959
Okay, so we have to throw

674
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,951
a massive party
from scratch in

675
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,195
five hours.

676
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,176
Yeah. And we got an office
full of pissed-off employees.

677
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,296
You guys, I got this. I have
a black belt in partying.

678
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,896
That's why I got kicked out
of boarding school

679
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,955
and two intensive care units.

680
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,838
Listen. Did you see this?
"It's F-ing Christmas, B's.

681
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,188
"Let's get mother-F-ing drunk.

682
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,958
- "Attendance mandatory."
- Yeah.

683
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,115
Lawsuit!

684
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,680
Mary, it's for
the greater good, okay?

685
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,136
Oh, Joel, would you
do me a favour?

686
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,376
Would you get Fred up
to Clay's office?

687
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,560
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

688
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,953
- Wait!
- Yup.

689
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,096
I don't know if it's helpful,

690
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,256
but regarding
the music tonight,

691
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,240
I happen to have a friend
who's a pretty good D.J.

692
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,954
Great. Bring him.

693
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,952
- See, we already got a D.J.
- Yep.

694
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,951
Um, so let me
get this straight.

695
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,349
Now we're having
this great party

696
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,317
and we're getting
our bonuses at it.

697
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,995
Yes, Jeremy,
because you deserve it!

698
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,191
Maybe you shouldn't have
promised them bonuses.

699
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,400
No, first rule of business:

700
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,949
Shoot for the moon
and you'll land on the sun.

701
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,712
I'd love to know
where you read that.

702
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,320
And let's just focus
on closing Walter.

703
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,958
You know, Carol burned
this place to the ground.

704
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,996
We are planting
the seeds of a new dawn.

705
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,072
Smitty? Clay Vanstone.

706
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,275
No, I'm not dead. That was

707
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,696
just a rumour,
although well-founded.

708
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,440
How much alcohol
can I legally buy from you?

709
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,755
Move out of my way.

710
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,115
I swear to God, I will drop
this on your back. Move!

711
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,719
You know what?

712
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,950
Merry Christmas,
you sweet motherfucker. Ah!

713
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,176
- You're coming, yeah, Smitty?
- Yes.

714
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,480
- Yes! Okay. You want this?
- No.

715
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,589
All right.

716
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,311
I'm keeping this lamb.

717
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,829
We need something else,

718
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,949
something that will
make us look cool.

719
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,936
Does anybody know anybody
who knows the Kanye West?

720
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,949
No.

721
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,757
But my girlfriend
does P.R. for the Bulls.

722
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,256
Okay, does your girlfriend
have a friend who knows

723
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,952
the man that makes us
call him Yeezy?

724
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,116
Nate,
what's up, man? Did you see?

725
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,834
Significant others are welcome
at the party. Look at that.

726
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,176
Looks like we're finally
gonna meet Becca.

727
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,349
Yeah!

728
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,635
Um, oh, shoot.

729
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,752
Uh, except she's working late
tonight. Modelling.

730
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,313
Is she shooting the cover

731
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,958
of Full of Shit magazine?

732
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,311
You know what?
She's gonna be there.

733
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,108
You guys!
Nate's girlfriend's coming!

734
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,394
Shit! Match, match,
match. Match! Come on.

735
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,396
Okay. Um, what are we gonna do
with these after the party?

736
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,829
Raffle.

737
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,997
For a failing branch,
we're surprisingly productive.

738
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,551
Yeah, I just wish Carol
could see this.

739
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,955
Uh, no, Clay,
that would be very bad.

740
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,314
Yeah, you're right.

741
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,776
All right,
go put on your party suits.

742
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,880
- Yeah.
- Tonight's gonna be

743
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
a great night.

744
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,555
Clay, I told you,

745
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,551
I don't need to do
any pre-game for...

746
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,952
- Carol.
- Pre-game for what?

747
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,759
For the, uh, work session
we got tonight.

748
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,712
And to complete...

749
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,056
We're closing
Walter Davis, you know?

750
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,280
It's going really,
really well.

751
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,096
- Hmm.
- Phase one's complete.

752
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,348
Why don't you come on in?

753
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,880
I thought you were
going to London.

754
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,190
I was on my way
to the airport,

755
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,118
but I thought
I would stop by and

756
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,631
have a tour
of your bachelor pad.

757
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,393
Well, that didn't take long.

758
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,552
How did you know
about my divorce?

759
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,320
Oh, you changed your
emergency contact to "self."

760
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,755
And nobody single by choice

761
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,096
would live this close
to the freeway.

762
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,951
Is that robe
why your wife left you?

763
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,109
What do you want, Carol?

764
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,952
I want you to work for me
in New York.

765
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,951
You basically run this branch
without the credit.

766
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,389
I will double your salary,
you'll get job security,

767
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,717
and a boss who doesn't
end every memo

768
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,949
with a quote from Aerosmith.

769
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,956
I could never do that to Clay,
and I'm very happy where I am.

770
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,355
- Really?
- Yeah.

771
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,953
I don't see happy.

772
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,750
I see crappy.
And a rug that makes me sad.

773
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,153
Anyway, um...

774
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,715
I don't know,

775
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,631
just think about it.
When the branch closes,

776
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,952
and Clay has a trust fund
to fall back on,

777
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,958
what are you gonna have?

778
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,959
Not much.

779
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,958
Merry Christmas!

780
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,959
- Thank you.
- You got it.

781
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,830
Hey, man. Good to see you. Hi.

782
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,315
Eight years

783
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,816
- I've been working here.
- Turn around.

784
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,831
What are you hoping to find
anyway, Carla?

785
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,120
What's your dream contraband?

786
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,958
I just like making you
my bitch.

787
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,837
- You can go.
- Thank you.

788
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,952
- Josh.
- Wow! You look like

789
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,951
Cinderella,
if she joined the TSA.

790
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,913
Very, very nice. Okay,
take a look at this, please.

791
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,075
Ooh, who's Mr December?

792
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,513
This is Walter Davis,
he's a VIP.

793
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,176
I want you to do me a favour
and let me know the second

794
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,360
he comes in. Can you do that?

795
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,136
You will hear
the sound of heavy flirting.

796
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,991
Or just a text.
That'd be great.

797
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,553
And are you
gonna join us later?

798
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,096
No, I doubt it. I have to
protect the front lines,

799
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,633
make sure
no crazy stuff happens.

800
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,955
But if it does...
I'm ready.

801
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,752
And you went with the yellow.
Smart.

802
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,909
Right?

803
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,553
Hey.

804
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,953
- How's everyone doing tonight?
- Great.

805
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,798
- It's my birthday.
- Ah.

806
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,355
Really committing.
That's nice.

807
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,272
Hey, look at that!

808
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,079
- Hi.
- Hey, there, Susan.

809
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,200
- Nice reindeer, right?
- How you doin'?

810
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,616
Throw that in coat check
for me please.

811
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,278
Thank you. You look great. Oh.

812
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,948
- Hey, Josh.
- Hey, Dean.

813
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,800
You... You thought you'd bring
the kid, huh?

814
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,275
Yeah. We couldn't get anyone
to watch him.

815
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,953
But don't worry,
he has an iPad.

816
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,336
We could axe murder each other
and he wouldn't even notice.

817
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,590
He'll just sit there with
that dumb look on his face.

818
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,393
Yeah, that's the one.

819
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,912
Okay. Well, can you stick him
in my office for me?

820
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,554
- If you're cool with that.
- Sure. Well, not cool, but...

821
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,716
- Have a good time.
- Thank you.

822
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,113
All right.
Let's drop him quick,

823
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,589
because these edibles
are gonna kick in any second.

824
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,198
- Hey, Mr Parker.
- Hey, Rodney.

825
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,958
- Want a Zeno Punch?
- No.

826
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,831
- Foam finger?
- Uh-uh, neither.

827
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,633
And, you know,
we can skip this, too.

828
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,558
- Good spirit, though. Yep.
- Okay.

829
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,353
Could I have a beer, please?
Pretty great, huh, Jeremy?

830
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,313
Yeah, it's so weird, I feel
like I'm still at the office.

831
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,949
Yeah. Oh. Thank you.

832
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,960
God,

833
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,510
I know I haven't asked You
for much in this life.

834
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,637
Granted, I was born rich.

835
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,997
And white.
And male. And straight.

836
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,631
Except for that one time.
But that's Las Vegas.

837
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,758
But tonight I need You
to bless this party.

838
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,992
This party has to rock.

839
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,958
So we can get
Walter's contract,

840
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,837
so that everyone
can keep their jobs,

841
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,190
especially Allison.
I mean, she is losing it!

842
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,756
And she has
all my personal information.

843
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,076
And so that we can prove
my sister wrong.

844
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,196
Show her
that I am a good boss.

845
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,951
And will You say hi
to our dad?

846
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,551
And tell him
we really miss him.

847
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,551
And that I'm rocking
his Santa suit.

848
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,440
Oh, and tell Prince
and David Bowie

849
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,953
how much they meant
to everybody.

850
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,951
I mean,
Labyrinth, Purple Rain...

851
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,115
They know.

852
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,594
All right,

853
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,717
let's light
this fucking candle.

854
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,836
Ho ho ho!
Merry Christmas, Zenotek!

855
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,558
It's me, Santa Claus!

856
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,952
I'ma comin' to town
for an epic night. Yay!

857
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,949
Santa!

858
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,952
That's okay, we'll get there.

859
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,712
Watch this, Greg.

860
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,590
Dean!
Clear. I'm coming around.

861
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,635
Oh, shit.

862
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,354
Oh, God.

863
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,959
It's okay!

864
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,956
It's okay!
That was part of it.

865
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,270
Okay, Santa,
what an entrance!

866
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,520
Oh! Right down
the chimney, folks!

867
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,393
Merry Christmas, bitches!
Santa can't be hurt.

868
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,976
You doing okay? You all right?

869
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,536
- That really did hurt, yeah...
- Are you sure?

870
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,200
But you know what,
I had this for padding.

871
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,357
Holy shit.
What the fuck is that?

872
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,936
Tell me that's not
for something illegal.

873
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,296
No, no, no.
Don't worry, this is all mine.

874
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,958
I rented one of
those Money Tornados.

875
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,399
So for the bonuses later,

876
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,096
I'm gonna make it rain
like a hurricane.

877
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,616
Are you sure you're not
getting carried away?

878
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,296
This seems like a lot of money
you're spending.

879
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,958
Josh, this is Christmas, okay?

880
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,953
And if anybody knows how to
work within a budget, it's me.

881
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,393
All right? And speaking of.

882
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,513
There you go. Hi.

883
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,949
- Cool.
- Little Jesus.

884
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,952
- Did you rent a live baby?
- Yeah, for the nativity scene.

885
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,952
What? It's cheaper
than you think, okay?

886
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,314
Is it?

887
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,393
Oh, shit! DJ Calvis
in the house tonight!

888
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,955
Oh, God, no.

889
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,995
Add my Snapchat: DJ Calvis.

890
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,631
Joel's friend looks
just like Joel.

891
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,952
Ooh! Looks like some babies
getting made tonight!

892
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,590
I'm not looking
to get pregnant tonight.

893
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,960
Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry.

894
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,150
Joel,
that's a red card for you.

895
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,191
Um, babies are not
getting made tonight,

896
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,958
not here on company property.

897
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,360
If you're going
to have intercourse,

898
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,198
please go beyond
the flood lamps

899
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,719
at the perimeter of the plaza

900
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,956
and into
the Rite Aid parking lot.

901
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,794
That's right.
'Cause we fucking tonight!

902
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,552
Joel. Language.

903
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,990
This is still an office, and

904
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,749
even though it's dark outside,
the rules don't turn off.

905
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,753
The rules may not turn off,
but your inhibitions can!

906
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,496
I'm talking about take
your pee-pees out

907
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,953
and put 'em in some booties!

908
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,068
And remember that tonight
the decisions you make

909
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,158
will have consequences
that will haunt you

910
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,077
for the rest of
your professional lives.

911
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,914
And, um...

912
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,758
And so have fun.

913
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,951
Yeah, Mary,
way to psyche everybody up!

914
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,392
Main takeaway:
If you're gonna fuck,

915
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,709
do it in the parking lot.

916
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,791
Turn it up!

917
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,633
- Hey.
- Hey! Someone cleans up nice.

918
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,949
Oh...

919
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,952
Yeah, I... I'm wearing the
same clothes, from earlier.

920
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,590
Oh, yeah. I was just making
a party joke.

921
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,552
I didn't want to go
all the way home

922
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,074
and then come back, so I just
sat in my car and worked.

923
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,512
Oh, also I was waiting for
my phone to charge.

924
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,952
Oh. So you're all charged up!

925
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,315
What?

926
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,591
I said you're all charged up.

927
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,279
Yeah, my phone.

928
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,319
Hey, the music is really loud.

929
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,958
Do you want to go
somewhere and talk?

930
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,311
- Uh, yeah.
- Okay.

931
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,079
This is Zenotek.

932
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,918
Oh, shit!

933
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,837
That's Jimmy Butler
right there!

934
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,313
Who's Jimmy Butler?

935
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,313
Two-time All-Star. Best player
on my fantasy team.

936
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,954
Fuck you, Butler!

937
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,991
I don't know why I said that.
Oh, fuck.

938
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,360
These are great.
You know what?

939
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,799
Why don't you
give me your number

940
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,000
and I'll text these to you.

941
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,753
Excuse me. Hey. Hi.

942
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,951
- Jimmy, hey, this is Josh.
- Hey. How you doing?

943
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,632
So you the big man
around here, huh?

944
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,910
I'm not that big, no.
I'm feeling small right now.

945
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,552
Look at this. Good for you.

946
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,109
Here's the big man!

947
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,594
Jimmy Buckets. Clay Vanstone.

948
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,520
Thanks for coming
to our Christmas party, man.

949
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,959
Of course.
I've been trying to expand

950
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,154
the Jimmy Butler empire

951
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,395
into the tech space.

952
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,936
I'm thinking
Jimmy Butler dating app.

953
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,951
- Maybe Butlerbook?
- I like it.

954
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,956
- Jimmyface?
- These are all good ideas.

955
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,176
Do you want to see the first
processor that we ever made?

956
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,320
It's as big as a mini-fridge
and it used to set fires.

957
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,976
It's upstairs with
the good tequila.

958
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,069
- Of course.
- Casamigos.

959
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,480
I'll save some for you.

960
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,791
Geek yourself out!
He's really into technology.

961
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,712
Will you remind me,
how do you know

962
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,915
Jimmy Butler again?

963
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,120
Remember, I told you my friend
does P.R. for the Bulls?

964
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,793
- Yes! Yeah.
- Right.

965
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,591
I thought that bringing
a famous basketball player

966
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,789
would help with Walter.

967
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,400
- Ah.
- You're cool with that, right?

968
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,960
Why wouldn't I be cool?

969
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,176
It's the greatest idea
in the world.

970
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,315
Of course I'm cool.

971
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,833
- Very cool. Please.
- Okay.

972
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,951
Yeah. Mr Cool.
I graduated valedictorian

973
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,791
from Cool University!

974
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,951
Good old C.U.

975
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,795
Mmm-hmm.

976
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,709
Okay.

977
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,069
"C.U." later!

978
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,957
Oh, Josh.

979
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,909
Savannah?

980
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,991
I think you mean Becca, right?

981
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,838
Uh...

982
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,110
I'm gonna be honest,
I've never done this before.

983
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,958
Although my mum
and I have watched

984
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,360
Pretty Woman, like,
a million times.

985
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,632
Oh, I love that movie!
It's why I'm doing this.

986
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,959
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

987
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,393
It feels kind of dirty.

988
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,959
You feel dirty?

989
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,996
You're my third client
tonight. It's only 9:00 PM.

990
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,595
Oh, really?

991
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,110
So, um, you just have
to pay my manager,

992
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,952
and then we're, like, good.

993
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,995
Oh, yeah, um...

994
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,188
Got it right here.

995
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,958
Hi. Nate.

996
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,188
- Nate?
- Yeah.

997
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,639
Hi, I'm Trina.

998
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,394
I don't do handshakes,
I do hugs. Get in here!

999
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,552
Oh, my gosh,
you guys are gonna have

1000
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,312
so much fun tonight.
I can feel it.

1001
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,959
- You're already a couple.
- Hope so.

1002
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,949
Already.

1003
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,598
- Is this for me?
- Um, yes, ma'am.

1004
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,792
Oh, my gosh. Look at him.
Prepared. I love that.

1005
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,949
I'm not even gonna count it.

1006
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,995
- You know why?
- Mmm-mmm.

1007
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,311
- 'Cause we're friends, right?
- Yeah.

1008
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,317
Yeah,
we're not fucking friends.

1009
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,594
Oh, my God.

1010
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,756
So if you're thinking
of fucking with me,

1011
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,273
or with my girl,

1012
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,757
don't. Because I'm hella
stressed out right now.

1013
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,110
This week has been
a scheduling nightmare!

1014
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,754
My iCal crashed,

1015
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,354
and now all my appointments
are set in 2019.

1016
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,955
And in Hebrew.

1017
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,195
It's a flawed program. I've
been saying this for years.

1018
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,958
Shut up.

1019
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,633
My point is,

1020
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,952
if one more person
pisses me off... One more...

1021
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,952
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

1022
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,798
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

1023
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,111
We're clear?

1024
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,953
Okay, so now, um,
just have a good time.

1025
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,392
If you use handcuffs,
have a spare key, okay?

1026
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,314
Jesus, we do not want to go
through Thanksgiving again.

1027
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,440
Um, hey, if you need me
in the next hour,

1028
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,629
I'll be at Whole Foods.

1029
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,795
Okay.

1030
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,952
Alexei, open my fucking door!

1031
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,960
Come on.
Let's go meet your friends.

1032
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,951
I can close it myself!

1033
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,072
I'm a woman in 2016. Jesus.

1034
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,749
Okay, Clay, incoming.
I just got a text from Carla.

1035
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,056
Walter's on his way up.
This is it.

1036
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,296
Okay, okay.
So we need an employee

1037
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,576
to sit on my lap
right when he comes up.

1038
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,953
A cheerful one.
Definitely not Jeremy.

1039
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,995
Uh, sure, great plan.

1040
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,555
Great. Good, good. Here.
You try and get this on.

1041
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,954
Hey, Walter!

1042
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,558
- Welcome to Zenotek.
- How are you?

1043
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,834
I'm so glad you came.

1044
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,056
Good to see you.
Can I take your coat?

1045
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,896
- No, no, I'm good, actually.
- You sure? Okay.

1046
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,936
All right. Walt, what would
you like to get started with?

1047
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,949
You know,
we got a photo booth.

1048
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,076
It's like getting your
picture taken in a tiny house.

1049
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,269
We love it.

1050
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,078
Oh, uh, Jimmy Butler is here!

1051
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,191
Jimmy Butler from the Bulls
is here.

1052
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,400
What? Come on! Where is he?

1053
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,920
Do you want to take a selfie
with him? Everyone's doin' it.

1054
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,518
You know,
I'm a Cavs fan, actually.

1055
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,948
- Oh.
- There's a good team.

1056
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,680
- This was a mistake.
- Hang on. Hang on.

1057
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,835
No, no, no. Come on.

1058
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,996
Now, a mistake would be
to miss the salmon station.

1059
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,269
Do you like salmon? Huh?

1060
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,717
You want to swim upstream with
me and go try some salmon?

1061
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,712
What does that even mean?

1062
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,816
You know what? Let's start
with a drink. Come on.

1063
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,400
Yeah. Are you thirsty? Clay,
you want a drink with Walter?

1064
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,631
One vibrator, please.

1065
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,553
Okay. Here you go.

1066
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,360
- It's really a body massager.
- No, it's a vibrator.

1067
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,750
Hey, Josh!

1068
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,712
Oh, hey, Jeremy.
This is Jeremy,

1069
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,074
our customer service manager.

1070
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,714
Hi, nice to meet you.
Mary just fucking cited me!

1071
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,273
Okay?
I thought this was a party.

1072
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,909
If I want to dick tap Alan,
I'm gonna dick tap Alan.

1073
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,995
That's a timeless gag!

1074
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,951
- Never not funny!
- Okay, off you go.

1075
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,959
She is like a poisonous
fucking cloud of shit gas,

1076
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,272
like, just seeping into
everybody's good time.

1077
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,274
Every word she says makes
my fucking haemorrhoids throb!

1078
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,950
- I want that on the record.
- It is.

1079
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,759
He's in customer service?

1080
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,976
Yeah, he's much better
on the phone.

1081
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,640
That's really where he shines.
Here we go.

1082
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,951
Hey, can we get a scotch?
Um, Macallan, right?

1083
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,311
Uh, no, dude.
It's the eggnog luge.

1084
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,313
Oh. Just the eggnog.
Okay. Great. Well...

1085
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,398
Uh, looks like fun.
Ladies first.

1086
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,552
- Josh, I insist. After you.
- Well, I'm not much on eggnog.

1087
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,976
Don't listen
to this guy. He's Mr Fun.

1088
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,309
He'll do anything for
the party. So, come on!

1089
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,120
Hey, everybody!
Josh is gonna do the luge!

1090
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,118
No, no. I don't think so.
It's not for me.

1091
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,120
Josh! Josh! Josh! Josh!

1092
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,312
It looks like
they want you to do it.

1093
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,118
Should I do it? I'll do it.

1094
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,949
I'll do it, I'll do it.
Okay, let's do it.

1095
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,276
This the luge right here?
Here we go.

1096
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,554
Here we go... Here we go...

1097
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,515
Mmm-hmm.

1098
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,915
Mmm.

1099
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,960
Oh, God.

1100
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,954
Whoo! Okay, Walter, your turn.

1101
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,149
Where'd Walter go?

1102
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,793
I totally got you
deep throating him.

1103
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,336
Oh, well, look at that.
That's beautiful.

1104
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,590
Where'd Walter go, huh?
Clay, did you see Walter?

1105
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,496
I don't know about
that whole throne thing.

1106
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,720
I mean,
nobody liked the gifts,

1107
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,976
everybody was complaining
and the lap-sitting got weird.

1108
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,115
Oh, no.

1109
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,269
What's happening?

1110
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,536
Well, it's just not working.

1111
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,696
If you took away
everybody's drinks

1112
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,789
and turned up the lights,

1113
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,816
it just looks like we're
at work. You know what I mean?

1114
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,955
We need to get amped up.

1115
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,757
We need to
get them interacting.

1116
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,736
You guys should do what you
did at the party last year.

1117
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,954
No. Not doing that. Come on.

1118
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,189
No, that was lame.

1119
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,176
No, no, it was fucking
awesome! People loved it!

1120
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,394
It wasn't. And they didn't.

1121
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,993
Do it for the company.
All right?

1122
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,839
I'm gonna go give Walter
party mouth-to-mouth.

1123
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,638
Is he crying?

1124
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,976
I wanted to give you
this pamphlet

1125
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,399
which has
a lot of good information

1126
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,955
about the signs and symptoms
of sadness.

1127
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,509
When I'm sad,

1128
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,160
I like to remember something
my grandma used to sing.

1129
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,995
It's about ducklings.

1130
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,959
Mary, you wore a blue coat,
right?

1131
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,952
- No, I wore my beige poof.
- Oh, that's it.

1132
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,160
It's probably not a big deal,

1133
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,191
but I saw Meghan rifling
through all the pockets.

1134
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,119
No, no, no, no.
My Bath & Body Works coupons!

1135
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,391
Walter.
Clay Vanstone, remember?

1136
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,629
- Hey.
- How are you?

1137
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,593
- I want to show you Zenotek.
- Ah. Yes.

1138
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,358
You're a very
expressive dancer.

1139
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,120
Oh, thanks.
Let me know if you want me

1140
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,957
to dance, like,
sexy or something, you know?

1141
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,000
- Yeah. No, we're good.
- Okay.

1142
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,958
Uh, hey, there's actually some
guys I want you to meet.

1143
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,149
Okay, great.

1144
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,336
Let's just work out the money
thing first, though, yeah?

1145
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,396
Uh, I already gave Trina $200.

1146
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,136
Oh, yeah, that's just
for the first hour.

1147
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,576
If you want me
for the rest of the night,

1148
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,953
it's gonna be another $2,000.

1149
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,953
- Two grand? No. No way.
- Yeah.

1150
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,336
The website clearly said

1151
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,191
it was $200
for the whole night.

1152
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,834
Do I look like
I'm $200 a night?

1153
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,350
Okay, fine.
I'll go to an ATM, okay?

1154
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,954
Okay. Give me your watch
as collateral.

1155
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:26,960
It's my grandmother's.

1156
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,155
I don't care.

1157
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,349
Shit.

1158
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,275
Holy shit.

1159
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:42,273
That was
just how daddy likes it.

1160
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,395
Mmm-hmm.

1161
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,789
Check it out.

1162
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,276
You're a fireman.

1163
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,918
Must be really nice to have
a day care centre at work.

1164
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,155
Yeah, yeah. Clay set this up
when I was pregnant.

1165
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,576
I think he just
wanted an excuse

1166
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,953
to have Play-Doh
in the office.

1167
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,552
- Shall we?
- Oh.

1168
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,831
- You are such a good mum.
- Aw.

1169
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,755
Thanks.

1170
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,389
I, uh, bet you'd make me
finish all my homework

1171
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,152
before I could
go outside and play.

1172
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,273
Yeah, especially
if you were being naughty.

1173
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,273
Do I need to be punished?

1174
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,956
Well, I guess that depends
on your homework.

1175
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,195
I bet you'd make me

1176
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,515
brush my teeth
so I don't get any cavities.

1177
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,957
Oh, we're still doing this.
Okay.

1178
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,158
I've been a bad boy, Mummy.

1179
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,954
Okay, um, do you have
some kind of weird fetish?

1180
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,952
What? No!

1181
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,880
No, I'm so sorry,
I didn't mean to give you

1182
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,960
that impression.

1183
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,399
- I just got carried away.
- Oh.

1184
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,751
I just really like you.

1185
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,951
Yeah. I really like you, too.

1186
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,592
Something's happening
in my diaper.

1187
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,518
- Okay. Fuck this. I got to go.
- Huh?

1188
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,896
- This is my nightmare.
- What?

1189
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,911
- So, yes, I'm in hell.
- No, uh...

1190
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,359
- So I'm gonna go.
- Mummy!

1191
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,794
I mean, Allison. Don't leave.

1192
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,192
Save that shit for the fourth
date like a normal person!

1193
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,954
Sorry.

1194
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,309
All right, Nate, this is what
you've been saving for.

1195
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,959
Who designed this?

1196
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,320
Come on!

1197
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,956
Shit! Fuck me!

1198
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,960
Yes.

1199
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,156
I'm okay! Merry Christmas!

1200
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,153
Okay. You ready?

1201
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,916
Okay, you look ridiculous.

1202
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,712
Is it the hat?

1203
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,911
Hey.
Merry Christmas, everybody!

1204
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,635
Who's happy
about the holidays?

1205
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,951
Okay. Okay.

1206
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,595
Hey, so, um, you dickheads
want to buy some cocaine?

1207
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,916
Yeah! We'll do that.

1208
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,831
One cocaine.
Want to do it with us?

1209
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,517
Yeah! Yeah!

1210
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,511
I believe in taking risks,
Walter.

1211
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,950
Zenotek, my company,
believes in taking risks.

1212
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,136
You know what
we should do tonight?

1213
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,296
We should do something
that scares us.

1214
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,389
Makes us feel alive!

1215
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,949
Do you think you could

1216
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,837
swing across the dance floor
with those lights?

1217
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,189
What's that?

1218
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,312
Like, if you grabbed
every single strand,

1219
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,616
do you think that
you could swing

1220
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,736
and then time it just right
and grab all of those strands,

1221
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,955
then, like Tarzan, make it
all the way to my office?

1222
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,951
Merry fucking Christmas.

1223
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,949
You know what?

1224
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,954
This has been really great,
and I thank you, but,

1225
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,776
it's time to hit the road.

1226
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,711
Oh. Um, you can't leave yet,

1227
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,120
'cause we're just
getting started!

1228
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,952
Hey! You got snow machined.
That's meant to be lucky.

1229
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:04,960
It tastes bitter.

1230
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
It's just paper products.
Let's get you cleaned up.

1231
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,391
Great, great.
So I guess we'll just take two

1232
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,736
and call you
in the morning, then?

1233
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,955
- Is that, uh...
- Yeah, don't call me.

1234
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,551
You on Snapchat?

1235
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,556
We'll be up here if you
want to come back up here.

1236
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,553
I need some air.

1237
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,830
Oh, also I have
your Secret Santa.

1238
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,069
Oh. Okay.

1239
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,953
What are you doing?

1240
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,599
Pissing off Mary.

1241
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,276
# GreatestPartyEver. #OpenBar.

1242
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,919
How do you spell "Hanukkah"?

1243
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,712
Wait, who are you
sending that to?

1244
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,951
Oh, you know,
everyone in Chicago.

1245
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,096
You've never
been up here?

1246
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,155
No.

1247
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,913
This is where
I usually am

1248
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,757
during the sexual harassment
seminars.

1249
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,837
Oh, it's beautiful.

1250
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,756
Oh, it's colder up here
for sure.

1251
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,958
And it's, uh...

1252
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,754
Oh, man, it's higher.

1253
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,117
Maybe let's go...
Let's go lower.

1254
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,953
And warmer. Come on.

1255
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,633
- Uh-oh.
- No. No, it never locks.

1256
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,150
Wait, no. It never locks!

1257
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,000
I bet you're also
never up here

1258
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,348
- at night, right?
- No.

1259
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,950
It's all right,
I came prepared.

1260
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:21,955
So did I.

1261
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,593
Your Secret Santa.

1262
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,680
That's a lot better
than where I'm keeping mine.

1263
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,315
Excuse me. Mr Vanstone?

1264
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,311
- Have you seen this?
- Hi. I'm Rodney.

1265
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,110
We haven't met
yet. I'm an intern here.

1266
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,395
I just wanted to say
Merry Christmas.

1267
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,320
- Yes, you can have a job.
- Are you serious?

1268
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,631
Yeah, party hire.
Junior associate. Congrats.

1269
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,751
Oh, my God.
Mr Vanstone, thank you!

1270
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,313
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

1271
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,040
- Oh, my God. Yes?
- Hey, Rodney!

1272
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,799
We're gonna get you
a new name.

1273
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,000
Done! I'll call my parents.

1274
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,198
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1275
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:54,960
Hey. You okay?

1276
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,952
Ha! I was down.
I was having a bad day.

1277
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,075
But now I'm lifting.

1278
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,280
I'm seeing things. My mind.

1279
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,316
The ideas are flying
through my mind!

1280
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,278
- I'm feeling strong.
- Okay, good.

1281
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,837
- High five. Ha!
- Sure.

1282
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:06,995
Ha-ha!

1283
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,554
You can't keep Walter Davis
down forever, baby!

1284
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,399
Let's go get fucked up.

1285
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,635
Okay, but not too much.

1286
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,954
When I drink,
a lot of bad things happen.

1287
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,296
You know, my sister's horse
goes missing.

1288
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,117
My car is covered
in horse hair and blood.

1289
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,315
Fingers get pointed.

1290
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,994
Smoke PCP as a favour.
Beach burns down.

1291
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,792
That ain't never been
my problem.

1292
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,831
Come on! Let's go get a drink!
Yeah!

1293
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,838
Oh, shit!

1294
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,256
We're expecting
blizzard conditions

1295
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,349
for 12 to 24 hours...

1296
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,555
Just get me on a plane.

1297
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,959
Get me on any goddamn plane,
all right?

1298
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,951
I have enough miles
to orbit the sun.

1299
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,720
I'm sorry, ma'am.
All flights are grounded

1300
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,795
until the snow clears.

1301
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,955
There's nothing more I can do.

1302
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,155
Well, refer me to someone
who can do something.

1303
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,952
That would be God, ma'am.

1304
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,831
Oh, Her.

1305
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,793
Have a great holiday.

1306
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,960
Shit.

1307
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,637
Did you eat my Cinnabon?

1308
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,754
No.

1309
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:43,989
Where's your mother?

1310
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,958
Bathroom.

1311
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,952
- What's your name, sweetie?
- Darcy.

1312
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,155
Oh.

1313
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:56,955
Hi, Santa.

1314
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,917
Yes, Carol Vanstone.
I'm here with Darcy.

1315
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,113
I know. Terrible name.

1316
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,757
And she's being
a little shit here

1317
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,989
in the first class lounge.

1318
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,599
So I think we should cancel

1319
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,188
all of her Christmas presents
this year.

1320
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,954
Yeah. And while she's asleep,

1321
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,275
why don't you take
that doll, too.

1322
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,954
Great. Bye.

1323
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,696
May I have
your attention, please.

1324
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,075
Due to inclement weather, all
flights have been cancelled.

1325
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,509
Shit!

1326
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,313
Fuck you!

1327
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,336
Zenotek, you having
a good time now?

1328
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,078
You ready to kick
this up a notch, huh?

1329
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,915
Hit me with the horns, Calvis!

1330
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,518
Old school.

1331
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,554
Make some noise!

1332
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,355
Yeah!

1333
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,749
# Here we go now!

1334
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,552
Is this not
the best fucking party

1335
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,119
y'all been to? Come on down!

1336
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,311
# Here we go now!
Here we go now!

1337
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,911
# Here we go, here we go!
Let me clear my throat

1338
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,952
Yeah, get on up here.

1339
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,720
Give it up for Walter!
My main man, Walter!

1340
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,635
Goddamn!

1341
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,193
Get on up here, Mary!

1342
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,960
Give me the mike. No, no, no.
Give me the mike.

1343
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,553
- Give it up for Mary!
- No, no.

1344
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,108
Mary, everybody, yeah!

1345
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,633
You got to stop.

1346
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,751
# When I say H, you say R

1347
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,951
# H.R.! H.R.!

1348
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,309
# When I say H, you say R

1349
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,630
# H.R.! H.R.!

1350
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,956
# And when she says H, you say R

1351
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,554
# H.R.! H.R.!

1352
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,551
Yeah!

1353
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,156
# If y'all want
to party like we do

1354
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,952
# If y'all want to party like us

1355
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,958
# Let me hear you say,
"Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!"

1356
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,396
# If y'all want
to party like we do

1357
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,959
# If y'all want to party like us

1358
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:58,352
# Let me hear you say,
"Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!"

1359
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,792
Okay, that's part of it. Yeah!

1360
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,040
She's what makes
this company great,

1361
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,918
just like every motherfucker
in here!

1362
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,315
# When I say freeze,
y'all freeze one time

1363
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,959
# Freeze!

1364
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,791
# Now let me clear my throat

1365
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,588
# Special dedication going out
to all the ladies

1366
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,960
# And all the brothers in here!

1367
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,959
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1368
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,757
This is fun, right?

1369
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,109
This has turned

1370
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,839
from charming
into life-threatening.

1371
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,832
I cannot believe that
they are still not responding.

1372
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,152
At least my death
will give my parents

1373
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,280
something to talk about
at the meal I'm gonna miss.

1374
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,320
- Going to your parents' place?
- Every year.

1375
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,957
This is where not having
any family actually pays off.

1376
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,952
I get the whole city
to myself.

1377
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,157
It's like some kind of
awesome plague came in

1378
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,271
and spared only me
and the Chinese restaurants.

1379
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,948
This is useless.

1380
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,951
You gonna be solo, huh?

1381
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,952
There's not gonna be
a stocking on your mantel

1382
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,552
for Jimmy Butler
at your place?

1383
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,391
- What are you doing?
- Nothing?

1384
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,757
Just asking. You know?

1385
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,913
You could have dated me, Josh.

1386
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,240
But you freaked out
and ran away.

1387
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,276
I still had PTSD from
my marriage just ending, so...

1388
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,951
You'd been separated
for a year.

1389
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,190
- I fucked up.
- Yeah.

1390
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,398
Because you're an idiot.

1391
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,313
I'm sorry.

1392
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,758
I have been feeling
shitty about it.

1393
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,951
We should've done this
a long time ago.

1394
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,958
- Yeah.
- Right?

1395
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,834
- Hey, Jeremy.
- Huh?

1396
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:06,949
Hey!

1397
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,757
- Hey, man.
- What's up, guys?

1398
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,748
Wow. Good thing I wasn't
going number two, huh?

1399
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,319
Yeah. Leave you to it.

1400
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,120
- This is my territory!
- Got it. That's clear.

1401
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,278
They can't shut us down!

1402
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,316
We're never gonna
get shut down!

1403
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,955
# When I say Zeno, you say Tek

1404
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,111
# Zeno-Tek! Zeno-Tek!

1405
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,755
# When I say Zeno, you say Tek

1406
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,951
# Zeno-Tek! Zeno-Tek!

1407
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,110
It's a Christmas miracle.

1408
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,956
# When I say Zeno, you say Tek

1409
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,076
# Zeno-Tek! Zeno-Tek!

1410
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,556
# When I say Zeno, you say Tek

1411
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,996
# Zeno-Tek! Zeno-Tek! #

1412
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,956
I love this party!

1413
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,108
I love this company!

1414
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,558
And I want to work
with you people!

1415
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,958
What did he just say?
Did Clay just close Walter?

1416
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,839
Huh, he really is Santa Claus.

1417
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:10,959
Yeah!

1418
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,997
So, Carol. You know,

1419
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,838
- that's my grandmother's name.
- Mmm.

1420
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,552
- No, I did not know that.
- Yeah.

1421
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,635
Oh.

1422
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,957
It's kind of an old-timey
name. Don't really hear

1423
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,952
Carol much anymore.

1424
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,120
It's like... "Hi, I'm Carol.

1425
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,352
"I gotta get home
before I miss my stories."

1426
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:59,958
"Hi, I'm Carol. I heard about
Pearl Harbor on the radio."

1427
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:03,953
"Hi, I'm Carol. I died
in the beginning of Up."

1428
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,988
That movie?

1429
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,716
Sorry, I'm just nervous.

1430
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,589
My first night on the job.
On the ol' J.O.B.

1431
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,955
- It's your first night?
- Yeah.

1432
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:14,960
Driving?

1433
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,280
First night driving
the ol' Ubes.

1434
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,954
It's a pretty sweet gig,
though. Make my own hours.

1435
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,798
You know, I could hook you up

1436
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,353
if you want to be
an Uber driver.

1437
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,760
I'm good. I already have
a job. Thank you very much.

1438
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,957
Yeah, but you could be CEO
of your own car!

1439
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,918
I am a CEO.

1440
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,075
Of Uber?

1441
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,273
Oh, my God.
Is this Undercover Boss?

1442
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,588
Is that a camera?

1443
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,155
Am I on ca...
Are you wearing a disguise?

1444
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,952
No.
This is not Undercover Boss.

1445
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,798
I am not the CEO of Uber.

1446
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,190
I am the CEO of Zenotek.
Please just drive.

1447
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,999
No shit.
I just dropped off,

1448
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,951
like, four people
at that party tonight.

1449
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:52,960
I'm sorry?

1450
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,514
They gave me three stars
like a bunch of bitches.

1451
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,953
Excuse me.
What did you just say?

1452
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,549
- I said they were bitches.
- No, no. What party?

1453
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,320
The party at your office.
Everybody's like, "Oooh."

1454
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,157
- You son of a bitch, Clay.
- Yeah, bunch of bitches!

1455
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,952
Can you just...

1456
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,155
Can you move? Move!

1457
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,757
The English band,
the Optic Monkeys?

1458
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,136
You were supposed to see them
with your friend Lindsey,

1459
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,280
you were like, "I can't go,"

1460
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,536
because you couldn't get
a babysitter?

1461
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,755
Did you hack into my emails?

1462
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,598
Get the fuck out of here.

1463
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,916
And never use
that British accent again.

1464
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,638
Allison, are you okay?

1465
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,592
No! I'm not okay.

1466
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,951
My ex-husband
is dating a stripper,

1467
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,151
Drew is cyberstalking me,

1468
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,759
and Fred from accounting

1469
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,910
is like a human fucking
AMBER Alert.

1470
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:47,073
Don't I deserve to date
someone who is nice?

1471
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,713
Of course you do.

1472
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,155
Allison,
you're an amazing person.

1473
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,794
You basically take care
of this whole office.

1474
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:54,949
And you do it every day,

1475
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,951
even though most people
don't seem to notice.

1476
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,359
So, yeah,

1477
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,592
you deserve someone nice.

1478
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:01,960
Baby,

1479
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:05,078
I got your text.
Ooh, I missed you.

1480
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,953
Come on, let's dance.

1481
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,951
Just hang in there.

1482
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,834
Go, Rodney! Go, Rodney!

1483
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,514
Nate!

1484
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,591
Hey, man.
Larry from shipping here

1485
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,976
actually has
a really great story

1486
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,274
that he wants to tell you.

1487
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,358
I was in the bathroom
washing my face,

1488
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,119
and this girl came in, like,

1489
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,589
"I'll give you a handy
for $40."

1490
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:37,955
And the next thing I knew,

1491
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:41,919
my penis was in her hand
and then she starts...

1492
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,551
Okay, Larry, I know
how a hand job works.

1493
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,200
I had no idea
you guys were together.

1494
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,959
Wait, what are you
talking about?

1495
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:51,316
So Becca gave Larry a hand job
in the men's room.

1496
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,954
Goddamn it!

1497
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,117
Ooh, ooh!
I'm going next.

1498
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,830
I'm inspired! I'm going next.

1499
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:03,312
- No, I called it. I called it.
- No, no, wait.

1500
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,194
- I'm so happy for you!
- Oh, shit.

1501
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,152
I was about to do my balls!

1502
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,955
Hey! What about
the 3D printer?

1503
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:12,753
- Yes. Yes!
- Yeah?

1504
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,193
I'm going first,
I'm going first!

1505
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,111
Excuse me. Excuse me!

1506
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,749
Excuse me.

1507
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,816
Raise your hands if
you're keeping your jobs!

1508
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:07,752
Raise your hands if you're
gonna get a bonus!

1509
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,834
Excuse me.

1510
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,075
Clay?

1511
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,915
Clay!

1512
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,593
Oh, fuck.

1513
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,154
Hey, sis.

1514
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:17,589
Hey, hey, hey.

1515
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,958
Carol, before you get mad,
listen to what I did.

1516
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,075
I said no party!

1517
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,976
That's all I said.
All you had to do was nothing,

1518
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,150
and you couldn't even do that!
Couldn't even do that!

1519
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:26,952
Carol, Carol, Carol!

1520
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,376
This is not
what you think, okay?

1521
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,594
This is all for a reason.

1522
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:34,190
Listen. We threw this party
for Walter Davis,

1523
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,515
and we closed him, he wants
to give us his business.

1524
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:37,755
- We did it.
- See?

1525
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,040
I'm not a failure. I'm a good
boss. The party worked!

1526
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,518
- Walter Davis?
- Yeah.

1527
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,360
- Is at this party?
- That's right.

1528
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,629
Where is he?

1529
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,389
I don't know. Where was he?
He was just on the stage.

1530
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,959
Oh... Guys? Guys!

1531
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,109
That's not good.

1532
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,073
Here we go!

1533
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,918
Do it! Do it! Do it!

1534
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,712
No, no, no. Shh!

1535
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,520
- What are you doing?
- Hey, that was my idea.

1536
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,910
- Not relevant.
- Walter? Hey, buddy!

1537
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,951
Why don't you come down
using the stairs?

1538
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:08,150
No. Clay, it's like you said!

1539
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,954
I want to do something
that scares me. To feel

1540
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,149
alive!

1541
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:13,953
Maybe not right now.

1542
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:15,712
What did you guys do to him?

1543
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,148
Let go of those lines, buddy!

1544
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:21,076
I'm the king of I.T. buyers!

1545
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:23,109
Whoo!

1546
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,313
- Oh!
- Shit!

1547
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,355
Oh!

1548
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,953
Oh, God.

1549
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,155
So close.

1550
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:39,909
Hey, Walter.

1551
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,056
You were like
an eagle up there.

1552
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,798
You were free. You did it.

1553
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:43,995
Did we win?

1554
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,713
Yeah, we won.

1555
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,111
Zenotek! Zenotek!

1556
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,794
That poor guy.

1557
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:50,960
What a day he's had.

1558
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,957
First he gets fired
and now this.

1559
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,791
- Wait, what?
- Did you say fired?

1560
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:55,960
Oh, yeah.

1561
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,957
Oh, he got fired at the close
of business today.

1562
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,200
He told me, like,
two hours ago.

1563
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,958
They shipped
his whole branch overseas.

1564
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:01,949
What?

1565
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,757
I confirmed it with
my H.R. Facebook group.

1566
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:04,955
And they know everything.

1567
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,080
Excuse me. Just to clarify,
because I'm detail-oriented.

1568
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,119
So you didn't get a contract
with Walter Davis

1569
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,630
because he didn't have
a contract to give.

1570
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,496
Carol, before you get mad,
here's the thing...

1571
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,560
He wanted to work with us.

1572
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:17,755
- So...
- Clay. Clay!

1573
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:18,955
Yeah?

1574
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,633
I'm not mad.

1575
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:21,955
You're not?

1576
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:24,554
I mean, I was mad when Dad
gave you this branch

1577
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,951
just as a reward
for taking six years

1578
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,952
to graduate with
a degree in... What is it?

1579
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,353
Canadian television theory
with concentration in Drake.

1580
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,279
But this
doesn't make me mad.

1581
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,557
- I feel relieved.
- All right.

1582
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:38,959
Because it's over.

1583
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,155
- I'm shutting you down.
- Yeah, no, because it's late.

1584
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,395
Allison got a clean-up crew

1585
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,696
- for tomorrow.
- Uh-huh.

1586
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,712
No, Clay.
I'm terminating this branch.

1587
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,269
I'm such a dickhead.
I started to like this place,

1588
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:52,316
and then I get fucked.
I get fucked!

1589
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,800
No, no, no. Stop it, stop it.
Carol, let's take one beat.

1590
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:55,949
Look, look, Carol. Carol.

1591
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,160
I fucked up, okay,
so blame me.

1592
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,394
But these are good people.

1593
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,800
You can't close this branch.
This is Dad's branch.

1594
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:01,949
Well, you know what?
He shouldn't have

1595
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,154
given it to you to fuck up.

1596
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:08,349
Oh, and, uh, good luck
trying to be Mr Fun Guy

1597
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,597
when you have to fire
all these people.

1598
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,755
Whoo!

1599
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,159
I'll see you in New York.

1600
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,315
Wait, what?

1601
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,913
Did your little friend
not tell you?

1602
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:16,949
He's coming to work for me.

1603
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,075
Yeah, right.

1604
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,320
I never said yes to that job.

1605
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,311
I don't recall you
ever saying no.

1606
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,115
Clay.

1607
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,555
Clay, I never sa... Hey.

1608
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:32,960
Clay.

1609
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:38,320
Oh, hey, Clay... You told me
you had a two-drink limit.

1610
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,078
Yeah. You're right.

1611
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:44,757
Now, y'all didn't forget
about DJ Calvis!

1612
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,717
Whoo!

1613
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,554
I want
to go back to the party!

1614
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,959
Whoo!

1615
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,712
Hey! What the hell?

1616
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,536
I hired you to pretend
to be my girlfriend,

1617
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,596
then you go and give all
my co-workers hand jobs?

1618
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,910
You hired me
to impress your co-workers,

1619
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,080
and he was pretty impressed.

1620
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,555
- Listen, I want my money back.
- Well...

1621
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,153
I'm sorry, what was that?

1622
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,511
I couldn't hear you
over my gun.

1623
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,354
- I, um, I want my money back.
- Oh.

1624
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:21,509
I'm sorry. Customer services
are not available right now,

1625
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,955
but perhaps
I can address your grievance.

1626
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,155
Um, everything's fine.

1627
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,952
Would you say like
a five on Yelp,

1628
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,956
or like positive three?

1629
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:30,960
Five.

1630
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,308
Five? Alexei!

1631
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:34,709
Uh...

1632
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:36,755
This is so funny.

1633
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,593
Do that thing where you pull
his asshole through his face.

1634
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,949
Don't please. Shit!

1635
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,190
Santa's gonna get
fucked up tonight!

1636
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,950
Who wants to party with Santa?

1637
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,399
Who the fuck is that?

1638
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,256
You know what,
that guy is really rich.

1639
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,759
And he's really stupid.

1640
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,816
Well, then what are we doing
with Spelling Bee here?

1641
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,353
Get outta here. Go!

1642
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,953
Hey, Santa! Wanna party?

1643
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:01,755
Yeah.

1644
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,951
Tracey! Tracey! Hey.

1645
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:06,949
Tracey!

1646
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,269
Hey!

1647
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:09,995
Tracey?

1648
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,837
Tracey, are you in here?

1649
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,154
Oh, pardon me.

1650
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,555
Hello?

1651
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:17,909
Oh.

1652
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,190
Josh, it's happening.

1653
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,154
Good for you.

1654
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,273
Hey, Tracey,
which one are you in?

1655
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:29,951
Hi. Carol offered me a job,
but in no way did I say...

1656
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,313
Josh. I get it.

1657
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,398
She offered me a job, too.

1658
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:35,632
- What? She offered you a job?
- Yeah.

1659
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:36,835
Triple the salary.

1660
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,552
An apartment
overlooking Central Park.

1661
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,956
I got double and moving costs.

1662
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,190
The real difference
is I said no.

1663
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,958
Listen, I'm not fighting
with you about this.

1664
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,176
It's silly.
I didn't take the job.

1665
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,191
Yeah. But you didn't
not take it, either.

1666
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,955
Because you need a safety net.
Hey, that's who you are.

1667
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,720
I'm happy for you.
You should go to New York.

1668
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,320
Is that what you want?
You want me to go to New York?

1669
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,551
There's a real
human centipede situation

1670
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:00,760
happening in the men's room.

1671
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,951
Tracey, please. Don't go.

1672
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,833
Whoa, this is almost the whole
marketing department in here.

1673
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,956
- Can I get a drink?
- Josh, Josh.

1674
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,188
Josh, where's Clay?

1675
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,960
Asswipe loses everybody
their jobs and runs.

1676
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:14,718
How much did he spend
on this party?

1677
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:15,949
He could have just given
that money to us.

1678
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,109
Clay sucks.

1679
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,536
We should just kill him,
like on that podcast.

1680
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,959
Put the Red Bull down.

1681
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,712
Respectfully, fuck you guys!

1682
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,632
Sorry,
that was too much, but...

1683
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,831
Clay cares more
about people

1684
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,188
than anyone I've ever met.

1685
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,153
He was gonna pay
your bonuses tonight

1686
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,360
with the last of his money.

1687
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,635
What?

1688
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,079
Yeah, he's broke.
Clay is broke.

1689
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,349
Who do you think paid

1690
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:36,112
for that bouncy house
in accounting?

1691
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,276
Training that dog
to deliver the mail?

1692
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,154
The zip-line?
Doughnut Fridays?

1693
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,599
It was all Clay!

1694
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:43,949
He spent all of his money

1695
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,798
trying to keep
this branch afloat.

1696
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,040
And whenever I questioned him
about it, he would say,

1697
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:50,396
"Treat your employees
like they're your family

1698
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,040
"and they'll do great things
for you."

1699
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,056
You guys,
Clay just left to get drugs

1700
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,149
with Becca and her pimp.

1701
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,509
Wait... Who's Becca?

1702
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,597
- Nate's whore.
- Hey, that's his girlfriend!

1703
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,279
Nope, she's right.

1704
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,193
Becca's a prostitute.

1705
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,759
Oh, nice.

1706
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:04,949
Oh. Nope.

1707
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,598
Clay left to go get drugs
with a pimp?

1708
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,950
Yes. She has a gun
and a serious mood imbalance.

1709
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,508
Fuck. Carol!

1710
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:11,715
We have a problem.

1711
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,480
Yeah, you have
lots of problems. Good luck.

1712
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,393
Carol, excuse me.

1713
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,798
Carol! Listen.

1714
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,996
Clay has gone to get wasted
with a psychopath,

1715
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,555
and he's got $300,000
strapped to his chest.

1716
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:25,070
Ooh, that really does sound
like a big problem...

1717
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:26,589
For Clay.

1718
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:27,760
You already lost your dad.

1719
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,512
If you lose Clay,
you'll have no one.

1720
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,950
Trust me, that's not a place
you want to be.

1721
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,793
- I don't care.
- What?

1722
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,160
- Oh, boy. This woman...
- What is wrong with her?

1723
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,069
Really?

1724
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,077
Guys! I don't know
what to do.

1725
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:44,400
Clay's not picking up
his phone.

1726
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,512
I think I can locate him.

1727
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,599
This is so amazing
to me, guys.

1728
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,240
We can actually
connect with, you know.

1729
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:51,958
Yeah. Yeah. There we go.

1730
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,075
- Amazing.
- Absolutely.

1731
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,320
They're full of shit, okay?
They're not your soulmates.

1732
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,634
They just hacked
your Facebook.

1733
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,269
- That's horseshit!
- Unbelievable. So uncool.

1734
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,640
- Hey, wait!
- No, no, no, girls!

1735
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,269
I knew you didn't like
the Gilmore Girls.

1736
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,056
Okay, I'm gonna need
both of you assclowns

1737
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,071
to hack into Clay's phone
so we can find him.

1738
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,056
Come on, why would
we help you, dude, seriously?

1739
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:10,718
Yeah, why would
we help you?

1740
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,633
Because I'm your fucking boss,
and I'm telling you to.

1741
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:16,633
- He can't touch him!
- I'll allow it.

1742
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,956
Ooh, there's a car on fire.
Did the Bears win?

1743
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,757
What are you looking at?

1744
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,149
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Oh, Jesus.

1745
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:41,518
Hey, if everybody's fired,

1746
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,593
let's burn this place
to the ground, baby!

1747
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,956
Hey! Hey, what department
are you in?

1748
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,513
I don't work here.

1749
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,075
Let's do this, baby!
Who's with me?

1750
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:54,949
Fuck.

1751
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,789
If I tell y'all
one more time to back up,

1752
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:06,956
it's gonna be a problem.
I'm not playing with y'all!

1753
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,376
Carla! Carla!
I need you to go upstairs

1754
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,136
and lock this shit down.
We gotta go help Clay.

1755
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:11,296
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
fuck that!

1756
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,959
The security guard was the
first one to go in Die Hard.

1757
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:16,998
Carla, this is the one
you knew would come.

1758
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,548
Be our John McClane.

1759
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,189
I'm on it.

1760
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:22,755
Hey.

1761
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:23,955
In case it gets dark.

1762
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,998
Who wants to get tased?

1763
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:31,791
Okay, where's your car?

1764
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,936
I took a cab. I thought
we were gonna take your car.

1765
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:34,960
No, I took the El.

1766
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,638
Let's go get our Santa.

1767
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:39,795
- Great!
- Oh.

1768
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,912
Come on! No, don't.
It's a lift and pull.

1769
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,576
You're jerking it!
Jesus Christ, let me do it.

1770
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:45,715
- I'm pulling out.
- Oh!

1771
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,597
All right. Yeah, it's...
It's locked.

1772
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:48,960
Thanks.

1773
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,638
Get in. Come on.

1774
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,559
What'd you get
all over your seats?

1775
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:55,949
Oh, no, it's from the parrots.

1776
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,598
Relax, it's not poop.
It's some...

1777
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,916
It's genital secretions.
It's mating season.

1778
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:01,916
- Oh.
- Should be dry.

1779
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:04,110
Okay. Nate says
Clay's on the South Side.

1780
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,918
He is not gonna
fuck this up for me.

1781
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:11,510
The board will vote me CEO.

1782
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:14,280
That is happening.
So let's just do this, okay?

1783
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,955
- Can this thing handle snow?
- Oh, please. It's a Kia.

1784
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,758
It's what God would drive.

1785
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,519
Oh!

1786
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,955
Guys, you know, the thing is,
I told everybody

1787
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:39,800
they were gonna be okay,
but then they weren't.

1788
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,718
And so, I broke a Christmas
promise, which...

1789
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:45,358
Is basically the worst thing
you can do.

1790
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,070
I mean, it is so stressful
being the boss.

1791
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,593
Nobody ever talks about that.

1792
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:50,955
No. No, not at all.

1793
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:51,949
And if you want to
complain about it,

1794
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,076
everybody's like,
"Oh, boo-hoo you, rich Santa."

1795
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,639
Yeah, no one gives a shit!

1796
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:56,955
I can't call people up
and be like,

1797
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,712
"Oh! I'm having
a bad pimp day."

1798
01:15:58,920 --> 01:15:59,955
See, you understand.

1799
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:03,277
I get clients calling me 24/7.
Middle of the night, 3:00 AM:

1800
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:04,714
Brring, brring, brring!

1801
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:06,831
"Hey, I need anal,
like yesterday."

1802
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:07,949
Yeah, the same with me!

1803
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:09,600
Except instead of anal,
it's data storage.

1804
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:11,791
Or, "I'm, like, chairing
a PTA meeting.

1805
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,576
"Can you have someone blow me
in the gymnasium?"

1806
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:14,953
Yeah, absolutely.
It never ends.

1807
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:17,958
Or, like, "Hey, your girl
just stabbed me in the leg

1808
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:19,640
"and now I'm bleeding out
in the alleyway."

1809
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:21,712
I don't relate
to that as much.

1810
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,070
It's mental, right?
How much people lean on you?

1811
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,794
And my sister wanted me
to be a failure,

1812
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,911
and I was, so she's
not gonna let that go.

1813
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,520
That's the problem of
working with family, though.

1814
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,070
- Yeah.
- You can never escape them.

1815
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:36,556
You can never escape them.

1816
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,296
But you know what,
you're gonna be fine, man.

1817
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,355
You know why?

1818
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,272
'Cause you've got
all that money, honey.

1819
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,950
Yeah, that's the thing.
I don't, actually.

1820
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,911
I spent it all trying
to keep the branch open.

1821
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:48,599
All I have left
is just $300,000 cash.

1822
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,154
You have 300 grand.

1823
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:51,816
Oh, my gosh. Whenever
I'm that low in my account,

1824
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,353
I'm just like, "Kill me."

1825
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:55,073
Uh, so where is the money?

1826
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:58,716
- It's on my person. It's safe.
- It's in your personal safe?

1827
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,896
Okay, we're close.
No, no, this is it! This is...

1828
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,797
There's a spot! Right there.
You passed it!

1829
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,791
Careful. Easy.

1830
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:10,909
Oh!

1831
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,953
That's how you park a minivan.

1832
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,718
- Jeez!
- Very impressive.

1833
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:17,593
Okay, Nate, are you sure
about this address here?

1834
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,950
Yes. 92765 Union Street.

1835
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,120
That's where the pin is.
Uh, Red Square Club.

1836
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,797
Brian, I can see you
fucking on my desk!

1837
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,794
Uh...

1838
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,835
- I'll go see what's going on.
- Okay.

1839
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,919
This is it.

1840
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,389
Oh, my God.

1841
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,195
Well, maybe he deserved it.
Who knows?

1842
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,753
Here we go, guys.
Come on.

1843
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:48,280
Quickly? Because I don't know
what's gonna happen in there.

1844
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,949
Last year I filed
a sexual harassment complaint

1845
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,194
against myself.

1846
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,958
- Against yourself.
- Mmm-hmm.

1847
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:58,555
Andrew, in the copy room,
he was changing the toner.

1848
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,190
And I pretended to drop
something on the ground

1849
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:03,193
so that I could bend over

1850
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:05,959
and graze his butt
with my nose.

1851
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:06,960
And I did.

1852
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:14,315
- That doesn't seem that bad.
- And then I said,

1853
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:18,633
"If you don't fuck me, buster,
I will ruin you."

1854
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,154
Hmm. That's harassment.

1855
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,153
That's why he quit.

1856
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,949
You seem like you feel better.
Here we go.

1857
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,115
Wait! No, guys,

1858
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:28,271
we can't go in there
looking like this.

1859
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,069
Hey, Carol?

1860
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,313
Why don't you
give me your coat?

1861
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:51,797
- How we doing tonight?
- Private party. Members only.

1862
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,400
Well, I'm a businessman.

1863
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:55,959
These are
my business ladies

1864
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,191
of the night. You hear
what I'm saying to you?

1865
01:18:58,640 --> 01:18:59,789
They only come out at night.

1866
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,280
- Okay. Okay.
- Mostly for parties.

1867
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,510
It's a beautiful
language.

1868
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,712
Nice, Carol.

1869
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:21,952
Seems like
an appropriate setting

1870
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,592
for an emotional rock bottom.

1871
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,956
Oh, there's a back room.

1872
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:38,755
Hi.

1873
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:41,070
How you doing? Have you
seen a guy in a Santa suit?

1874
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,271
Fuck you.
I don't tell you anything.

1875
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,160
- All right, now listen here.
- Nuh-uh-uh.

1876
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,395
Hi. Me again. Where's Santa?

1877
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:53,988
Fuck you.

1878
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,950
You do not want to die at
the hands of Lululemon here.

1879
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,056
It'd be real embarrassing.
You're a large guy,

1880
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,594
and she's made of nothing
but salad and Smartwater.

1881
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:03,955
Nope, no tap outs.

1882
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:06,718
Back door? Thank you.

1883
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,359
- Bitch.
- What?

1884
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,115
Was that too much?

1885
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:13,117
- Just a little.
- I loved it.

1886
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:14,549
Let's go.

1887
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,791
- Hey!
- Oh, God.

1888
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,359
Oh. Go. I got this. Go, go.

1889
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:19,953
Okay. Enjoy.

1890
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,272
Come on, let's party.

1891
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,836
Vin Diesel
ain't got shit on me!

1892
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:28,995
Clay!

1893
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,638
What did he say?

1894
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:32,896
I think I know
where they're going.

1895
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,000
Let's get the car. Come on!

1896
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,279
Let's go!

1897
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:42,960
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1898
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,275
Hey, Mary?
Mary, get in the car!

1899
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,359
Damn it.

1900
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:05,109
# God rest ye merry gentlemen

1901
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,638
# Let nothing you dismay

1902
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:13,157
# Remember Christ the Saviour

1903
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,837
# Was born on Christmas Day

1904
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:21,394
# To save us all
from Satan's power

1905
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,354
# When we were gone astray

1906
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:30,716
# Tidings of comfort and joy

1907
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,513
# Comfort and joy

1908
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,748
# Oh, tidings of comfort

1909
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,316
# Comfort and joy! #

1910
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,320
- Oh, God.
- Yeah, I fucked up. I did.

1911
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:03,954
I lost a lot of people's jobs.

1912
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,837
I hurt a lot of
good people tonight.

1913
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:07,359
Oh, yeah, totally. Cool story.

1914
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:08,776
Are we coming up
to your apartment building

1915
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,040
on the left,
to the right, or...

1916
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:11,440
We're not going
to my apartment.

1917
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:12,629
Uh, yes, we are.

1918
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,616
We are going to your apartment
to go to the safe.

1919
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,631
There's nothing safe
about what we're gonna do.

1920
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,320
Yeah, it's like you said,
you know.

1921
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,749
We need to escape them,
so that's what we're gonna do.

1922
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,552
- Red light.
- What the fuck

1923
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:23,954
are you talking about?
There's a red light!

1924
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:24,960
That's a red light!

1925
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,158
Oh, yeah!

1926
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,308
We go right through 'em.
They're just suggestions.

1927
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:37,176
- Can you look at that fuck?
- Oh, the fucking windshield.

1928
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,315
Are you kidding? Not now!

1929
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,440
That's the A.C., Josh.
We don't need that right now.

1930
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:41,635
What about that?

1931
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:42,936
Oh. No,
that's the recirculating mode.

1932
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,952
How am I gonna run Zenotek
without this Genius Bar?

1933
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,136
You can get up here
and help if you'd like.

1934
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,559
Okay, my seat's
getting hotter.

1935
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:49,955
Mary, why do you even
have a minivan?

1936
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,996
- You don't have kids.
- I buy in bulk!

1937
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:53,776
- Oh! It's them!
- Yeah.

1938
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,056
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
good eyes.

1939
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,957
Oh, God! What's that smell?

1940
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,120
I'm gonna be honest with you,

1941
01:22:58,160 --> 01:22:59,600
I have been farting
this entire time.

1942
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,953
Oh, my gosh.

1943
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,149
Okay, you know what,

1944
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:07,952
take me to your
personal safe right now.

1945
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,640
We don't need money
where we're going.

1946
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:10,948
- Where are we going?
- For glory.

1947
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,075
The Clark Street Bridge.

1948
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:13,554
This time of night
it'll be up.

1949
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:15,949
We're gonna jump the bridge
and never look back.

1950
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:24,200
Okay, new game. Pull over.

1951
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:25,536
Just pull over
or I'll tuck and roll.

1952
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:26,936
- No, no, no. Trina, Trina.
- Just slow down.

1953
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,776
Trina, I've been thinking
about this for a while.

1954
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:29,915
We can make this jump.

1955
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:30,949
I let a lot of people down,

1956
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,518
but I'm not gonna
let you guys down.

1957
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:34,955
We're gonna escape our
families and become anew!

1958
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:36,354
Pull over right now.

1959
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:38,078
Or I shoot you
in the fucking brain.

1960
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,599
Well, you can't shoot him,

1961
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:41,278
because then
he's gonna crash the car.

1962
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,590
Really, Savannah? Really?

1963
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:44,949
Why don't you
put it in an email

1964
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:46,096
and c.c. everyone, all right?

1965
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:47,917
Make double sure
everyone got it.

1966
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,795
You know what, you should
start a podcast, Savannah,

1967
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:53,070
called "Savannah Says Fucking
Stupid Things Out Loud."

1968
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:00,960
Clay!

1969
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:02,593
Clay!
Hey, listen, I'm sorry!

1970
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:03,994
I was never gonna
take that job.

1971
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,389
Not good enough!

1972
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,073
Do not jump that bridge.

1973
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,953
I have to do this.
Carol's right, I'm a fuckup!

1974
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:12,395
Shit!

1975
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:20,719
Pull over, you fucking idiot!

1976
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,349
Or, the nice
supportive version?

1977
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:26,075
Pull over, fucking idiot!

1978
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,315
No.

1979
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,078
Hey, tell him to pull over,
lady!

1980
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:33,273
Look. Pull over! Pull over!
Pull over! It doesn't work!

1981
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:36,359
- It's not working.
- None of it works!

1982
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:37,794
Hey, Clay,

1983
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:40,713
you jump that bridge,
I'm going with you.

1984
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:41,955
What? No!

1985
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,400
Yes, I am.

1986
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,954
Did you say hit it
at 80 or 90, Vin Diesel?

1987
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:48,949
- Put it into sport.
- Here we go.

1988
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,517
Josh, I'm sorry that
I said you were safe.

1989
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,797
- You don't have to do this.
- Yes, I do.

1990
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:57,916
Josh, what are you
doing, man?

1991
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,916
You go, we all go!

1992
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:01,960
Fuck.

1993
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:04,831
I love America!

1994
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,833
I am not gonna die
in a minivan.

1995
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,760
Hey, hey, hey!
Get off the wheel!

1996
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:02,633
We could've made that bridge,
panty hose.

1997
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,639
Where's Clay?

1998
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:15,959
It was on your person.

1999
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:23,638
What did we hit?

2000
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,951
The collision severed
the primary fibre line,

2001
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:27,638
as well as its backup,

2002
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,751
paralyzing Internet, DSL,

2003
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,956
and cellular
communications citywide.

2004
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,350
So if you haven't ordered
your holiday gifts early,

2005
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:36,636
you may not be able
to order them at all.

2006
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,951
I quit, by the way!

2007
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,389
You quit what? What, Savannah?
What'd you quit?

2008
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:43,153
Just a couple
of normal girls here.

2009
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:44,953
Move it, move it!
Clear!

2010
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,553
The Internet's down.

2011
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:48,313
My brother needs a doctor!

2012
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,959
Ma'am, you're gonna
need to wait your turn.

2013
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,736
Will you find someone
that will help my brother?

2014
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,955
All of you, just back up!

2015
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:57,317
Back up. Make a single
file line against that wall

2016
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:00,950
and she will be with you
when she has a fucking minute!

2017
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:12,557
You know, you trying to jump
that bridge was really...

2018
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,950
Brave?
That what you were going for?

2019
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:17,712
No. Stupid.
I was gonna say stupid.

2020
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,756
No. I... I would say brave.

2021
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,796
- A little brave.
- Yeah. Hi.

2022
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:23,951
- Hey, how is he?
- Oh. He's fine.

2023
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,911
In fact, the doctor said
that the crash

2024
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,394
actually fixed
a previous fracture.

2025
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,791
He's got...
He's got this gift.

2026
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:32,114
I don't... I don't get it.

2027
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:34,555
- Oh. Thank God he's okay.
- Oh, well...

2028
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:37,110
So, maybe you'll reconsider
firing everyone?

2029
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,789
Once it gets out there
that we caused this crash,

2030
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:40,989
the board finds out,

2031
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,311
my ass is fired.
No one has a job.

2032
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,910
- So...
- Carol?

2033
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,275
Is now a good time to exchange
insurance information

2034
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:49,634
for the car stuff?

2035
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:52,638
It's not. You know, we
would've made it, by the way.

2036
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:54,956
- At the speed you were going?
- Comfortably.

2037
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:57,116
Please. To make that jump,
with that incline,

2038
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,156
you would have had to
at least been going...

2039
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:00,952
- 110.
- 95.

2040
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,959
No, 95.

2041
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:07,200
- It's simple math.
- Oh. Well, okay.

2042
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,277
It might be simple on paper,

2043
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:12,397
but you're forgetting the
wind, the weight of the Kia,

2044
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,632
the four of us,

2045
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,315
bird cages...

2046
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:19,797
I prefer to call them bird
condos, and so do the birds.

2047
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:22,754
Point being, you have
to adjust your numbers

2048
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:25,149
to account
for real world conditions.

2049
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:28,957
Simple. Or did they not teach
you that in hacker college?

2050
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:30,275
You're right.

2051
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:31,515
Thank you.

2052
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,319
No, not about that.

2053
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:35,197
Although hacker college
does sound awesome.

2054
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:38,110
It's AnywAir.
I've been doing it wrong.

2055
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,830
I... I've been treating
the power grid

2056
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,712
as if it was
a seamless source of Internet.

2057
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:47,269
It's not seamless, it's messy.
It...

2058
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:49,957
But if there was
an opportunity

2059
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,951
where the conditions
were just right.

2060
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:56,757
If we were inside of a vacuum.
If it was still.

2061
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:58,957
Oh, my God.

2062
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:01,000
- An Internet blackout.
- An Internet blackout!

2063
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,256
Let's get you back
to the office.

2064
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,315
- Yes!
- Come on.

2065
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:06,076
I'm gonna text you
that claims form, yeah?

2066
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,952
- I'm sorry, Mary.
- Go save the company!

2067
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,359
Mum?

2068
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,154
Dad?

2069
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:12,635
Oh, my...

2070
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:16,912
Oh. Hey.

2071
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,195
Hey.

2072
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:22,995
Carla!

2073
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,394
- Wassup?
- Morning.

2074
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,955
I tased as many
as I could, but...

2075
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:29,680
Yeah. Well, I actually thought
it was gonna be worse, so...

2076
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:30,960
Uh-uh!

2077
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:33,719
I see you, bitch!
Uh-uh, bitch, I see you!

2078
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:35,552
Your office was locked, right?

2079
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:36,914
Yeah, of course.

2080
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:39,833
- What... What's happening?
- Did you guys find Clay?

2081
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,757
- Sorry. Old habit.
- Sure.

2082
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:53,514
Okay. So, what...
You're writing an algorithm

2083
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,636
that can respond
to the grid in real time?

2084
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,398
- That's gonna take...
- Done.

2085
01:30:58,720 --> 01:30:59,755
Forever.

2086
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:02,355
Nate! How's that server bank?

2087
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:04,796
Still covered in beer!
Five minutes!

2088
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,598
I hope it's beer.

2089
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:08,995
Hey.

2090
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:10,394
Uh, about what happened...

2091
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:11,959
All good.
Everyone has their thing.

2092
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:14,076
I know it seems weird,
but I just crave discipline.

2093
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:15,832
My family had
no set meal times.

2094
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:18,076
Yeah, it's cool. I don't
need your origin story.

2095
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,356
Promise me
you won't tell anyone?

2096
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,392
- I'll do your taxes!
- Deal.

2097
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:23,795
Great.

2098
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:26,952
Oh, my God, the office.
Hey, guys, I got doughnuts!

2099
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:29,958
I got, uh, jelly and glazed
and, uh,

2100
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:31,952
some other stuff.
But no Cronuts,

2101
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:33,359
that's a bastard pastry.

2102
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,632
I still hate your rules.

2103
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,630
But your dancing is

2104
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:43,393
wild and free.

2105
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,791
Like an unmanned fire hose.

2106
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:49,757
Put your pants on.

2107
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:54,069
For now.

2108
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:57,752
Now, we can't fix the Internet

2109
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:58,955
if we can't
get on the Internet.

2110
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,188
Everything is down.

2111
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:01,776
Okay, well,
all the phones are working.

2112
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:02,949
What about a dial-up modem?

2113
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,376
Great. Now all you need
is a RadioShack

2114
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,549
and a time machine.

2115
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:08,154
- Oh, the G1 had it, right?
- There's one in Clay's office.

2116
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,480
I got the desk. Get the desk.

2117
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,909
Okay, give me the wires.
Plug it in here. Give me that.

2118
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:14,076
Hey, I could use some of
that giddy-up in H.R.

2119
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:15,976
if you two ponies
are looking for a new stable.

2120
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,176
I am looking
for a new stable, Mary.

2121
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:18,536
Thank you so much.
We'll talk later.

2122
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,696
Mary, you're showing
a lot of neck.

2123
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:20,789
Breaking your own rules.

2124
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:22,757
It's a little skanky,
isn't it?

2125
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:24,313
- Plug it in.
- Plugged in.

2126
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:25,959
Uh, I got this D.J. equipment,

2127
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,296
if you want to
use that for something.

2128
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:29,000
Okay, that's not gonna help,
but thank you.

2129
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:30,395
All right, guys.

2130
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:32,155
What now?

2131
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:34,749
I press "Enter," it launches
the protocol, and then...

2132
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,176
And then everybody gets
back on the Internet.

2133
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:37,349
Hopefully.

2134
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:38,953
Or I blow up the power grid.

2135
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,071
- So be ready for that.
- Okay?

2136
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,510
Don't worry about that.
Just hit "Enter."

2137
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:44,949
Okay, guys.

2138
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:46,835
Here we go.

2139
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:57,552
Power's still on.

2140
01:32:57,640 --> 01:32:59,198
Yeah, I'm honestly
shocked by that.

2141
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:00,753
No Internet yet, though.

2142
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:01,955
It could take a few seconds.

2143
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:03,791
If it works, you'll have
a connection alert.

2144
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:05,912
- No.
- No, nothing.

2145
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,718
Nothing yet.

2146
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:10,958
- No? Anybody?
- No.

2147
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:12,195
No, nothing.

2148
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,355
Josh?

2149
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:14,960
No. Just give it
a little more time.

2150
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:18,958
Maybe it wasn't ready.

2151
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,992
Tracey, hey.

2152
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:22,833
It's ready.

2153
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:25,515
Still dead.
Waiting for it. Still dead.

2154
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:32,960
- Is that you?
- Got it.

2155
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:34,115
- Got it!
- Oh, my God.

2156
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,312
- Yep, I got it.
- Oh, my God!

2157
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:37,948
- Was that you?
- I got it!

2158
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,536
Yeah, I got it, too!

2159
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:42,393
I got mine! Yeah.
Yeah, there's mine. Holy shit!

2160
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:44,068
- Tracey!
- You did it!

2161
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:09,318
Work never stops.
You see that?

2162
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:11,391
Excuse me. Excuse me.

2163
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:14,195
Hello, yes. I am happy for
you, but I do need you to

2164
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,550
sign a personal
relationship disclosure form

2165
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:17,755
before this rounds first.

2166
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,398
No. No, I don't think so.

2167
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:21,995
Hey, Mary, sign this.

2168
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:25,192
Oh. Oh, you know what?
Um, I really like you,

2169
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:27,736
um, but maybe we could get,
like, a cup of coffee first,

2170
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:28,829
or something?

2171
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:30,837
Yeah! Totally.

2172
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:33,190
That's what I meant by,
"Sign this."

2173
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:35,198
- You know what? Forget it.
- Okay.

2174
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:48,275
Glass of wine
in a family photo?

2175
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:50,750
Look at him in that suit.
What a stud.

2176
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:53,071
He wore that better than you.

2177
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:55,714
Yeah, he did a lot of things
better than me.

2178
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:57,632
You're right
to be pissed at me.

2179
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,256
You know, I always got to do
whatever I wanted

2180
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:00,349
and you always ended up

2181
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:01,720
with the shit end
of the stick.

2182
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,193
It wasn't fair.

2183
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:05,993
I'm sorry, sis.

2184
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:08,956
Thank you for that.

2185
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,831
You never got to be
the fun one, huh?

2186
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:13,712
- I mean, I could have. Right?
- Yeah.

2187
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,176
- Sure.
- I have... I have a fun side.

2188
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,395
I've seen it many a time.

2189
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:18,755
I mean...

2190
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:20,757
Off the top of my head, I...

2191
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:22,951
Remember that Thanksgiving
that you taught everybody

2192
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:24,757
the real rules of Monopoly?

2193
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:27,080
With the bidding wars and
the strict time limit and...

2194
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:29,315
- Yeah, that wasn't fun.
- I know.

2195
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:32,916
Hi! My pain is at
a 9 or a 10 or 11.

2196
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,552
Whatever on the chart, the...

2197
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:35,960
That face?

2198
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:37,594
So can I get some Dilaudid

2199
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:39,480
in another one of
those little gelatine cups?

2200
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,955
You can't buy those.
I looked it up.

2201
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:46,955
Huh. The Internet's back up.

2202
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:49,630
What the hell is a Zenotek?

2203
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:51,314
- What?
- What?

2204
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:56,913
Oh, my God!
She did it. She did it!

2205
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,712
- Shut the fuck door!
- Oh.

2206
01:35:58,920 --> 01:35:59,955
I gotta tell you,
I was always like,

2207
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:01,518
"Tracey, this doesn't
make any sense,"

2208
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,200
and she was like,
"Words, words, words

2209
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:04,952
"and some numbers."
But she did it.

2210
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:06,909
Oh, my God.

2211
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:08,616
Wait. So, this means everybody
gets to keep their jobs?

2212
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:09,816
Everybody gets to
keep their jobs.

2213
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:10,955
Yes!

2214
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,116
God, I am gonna be CEO.

2215
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,118
Because you deserve it.

2216
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:17,950
And you throw
a great fucking party.

2217
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:20,316
Yeah. I did, didn't I?

2218
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:22,958
- Oh! Walter.
- Walter.

2219
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:24,995
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

2220
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:27,197
- Carol.
- Carol, nice to meet you.

2221
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:29,197
There's my eagle. Hey.

2222
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:33,116
I just want to thank you
for the best night of my life!

2223
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:34,754
Yeah? Yeah?

2224
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:36,952
I'll see you on Monday.

2225
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:41,950
Well, it looks like
we just hired Walter Davis.

2226
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:45,757
Well, he'll fit right in.

2227
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:48,389
Wow.

2228
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:49,959
Did you see that?

2229
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:52,549
Oh.

2230
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:54,751
- What are you doing?
- Winner!

2231
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:56,996
- We weren't racing.
- Well, you weren't.

2232
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:59,520
Why do you think they always
make you leave a hospital

2233
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:00,953
in a wheelchair?

2234
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:07,113
What are you guys
doing here?

2235
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:09,000
Well, we can't
go to breakfast without you.

2236
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:11,320
- Come on, we're celebrating.
- Come on, let's go.

2237
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:14,918
I'm in. Breakfast is
the most important meal

2238
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:15,995
- of the morning.
- Whoa!

2239
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:17,838
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa.

2240
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:18,960
We good?

2241
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:21,951
Yeah. We're good.

2242
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:24,550
- I'll go back down.
- Your ankle is broken.

2243
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:26,796
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Yes.

2244
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:28,176
- Oh.
- You left this in your room.

2245
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:29,952
Oh, I did.
Thank you. I'm sorry.

2246
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:31,753
And also this.

2247
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:34,554
Oh, thank you, Doctor. Here.

2248
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:36,709
No.

2249
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,096
- Wanna get out of here?
- Let's go.

2250
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:40,554
Oh, no. I'm not getting in
that. I ordered us an Uber.

2251
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:41,709
Carol?

2252
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:44,792
I don't mean this in a creepy
way, but get in the van.

2253
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,520
Yeah, we got to keep
this train rolling.

2254
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:47,755
- No.
- Yes.

2255
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:50,195
No! You cannot have alcohol
on your medication.

2256
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,118
Uh, fuck that.
Drinking is medication.

2257
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,200
Doctor, this is a...
This is a work breakfast.

2258
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:55,952
There will be
no alcohol at all.

2259
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:56,995
Okay?

2260
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,274
Yeah.

2261
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:01,594
I saw that.

2262
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:03,950
Doctor, I assure you.
I am in charge.

2263
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:06,116
There will be
no more partying.

2264
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,956
I'm literally standing
right in front of you.

2265
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:10,960
I'm literally right here.

2266
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:13,554
I just don't know what it is
you think that I'm not seeing.

2267
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:16,957
Doctor, I would never disobey
medical advice.

2268
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:19,954
Just go, just go.

2269
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,176
It's an office thing.
Here we go.

2270
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:22,336
- Merry Christmas.
- Let's go.

2271
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:23,759
Let's roll it
to the car.

2272
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:25,114
Okay, Happy Holidays.

2273
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:26,952
Thank you for
your service, Doctor.

2274
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:28,712
Okay.

2275
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:31,949
Okay. You need any help
working your way out of here?

2276
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:34,315
Please, Josh.
I was born in a U-Haul.

2277
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:43,389
Hey, Carol!

2278
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:46,394
- Are you Carol?
- What? Uh, no.

2279
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:48,831
Are you sure?
You look like a Carol.

2280
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,835
Can you not hear me? Carol!

2281
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:54,954
Carol!

2282
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:56,755
Ugh.

2283
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:00,313
Cancelled?

2284
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:02,830
Bunch of bitches!

2285
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:05,958
You know red lights
are just suggestions.

2286
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:07,951
Are you smoking a
marijuana cigarette right now?

2287
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:12,954
Yeah! See, we made it
through. Let's do another.

2288
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:31,518
Oh, not again.

2289
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:35,635
Let me do it again.

2290
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:37,136
Let me just do it again.
I can do it.

2291
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:39,151
Oh, damn it.

2292
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:42,593
Shit, shit!

2293
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,720
If you want to make it
in this world,

2294
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:47,915
learn to lie better.

2295
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:50,073
Your mother's never
coming back.

2296
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:51,918
Merry Christmas!

2297
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:56,949
Okay, I'm gonna suck my dick.

2298
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:58,560
She's gonna suck
on this one, guys.

2299
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:00,909
Guys, can we go back to one
for sucking my dick?

2300
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:06,976
I like it 'cause it looks
like he's trying

2301
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,592
just a little too hard.

2302
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:09,789
The artist?

2303
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,592
I hadn't thought
about the artist.

2304
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:14,109
Was this not where
you had the key

2305
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:16,156
to the city of Margaritaville?

2306
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:19,511
I did it. I got rid of it.

2307
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:24,954
Canadian cinema

2308
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,951
with a concentration
in French-Canadian cinema.

2309
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:29,913
Canadian music with
a concentration in Rush.

2310
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:32,155
Canadian linguistics. Eh?

2311
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:48,360
He used all of
his inheritance...

2312
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,950
He used all of his inher...

2313
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,956
He used all of
his inheritance.

2314
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:55,359
It's a hard word to say.

2315
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:59,952
To keep this branch afloat
with his in-her-i-tance.

2316
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:12,355
"Hi, I'm Carol.
I have the shingles again."

2317
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:14,955
"I'm Carol.
Has anyone seen my TV Guide?"

2318
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:17,794
"I'm Carol.
Change frightens me."

2319
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:19,951
"We have to put Carol down.
She's old."

2320
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,952
Andrew from the copy room
told me that he had mono.

2321
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:33,958
I said I wanted to get mono

2322
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:36,349
because I wanted to take
a month off from work.

2323
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:38,591
And I kissed him deeply.

2324
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,591
And I didn't get mono!

2325
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,353
Okay, let's reset.

2325

2
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,413
Since Mid-Qing Dynasty

3
00:00:37,664 --> 00:00:41,000
western powers have invaded China

4
00:00:41,376 --> 00:00:46,297
China was facing
unprecedented challenges...

5
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,299
Out of the way

6
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:50,677
Move!

7
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,762
In order to save China from the invaders

8
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:54,639
progressive party initiated
the Self-Strengthening Movement

9
00:00:54,806 --> 00:00:56,307
Prince Dun is the leader...

10
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:57,183
Prince Dun

11
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,268
We have lost the city of Beitang

12
00:00:58,393 --> 00:01:00,687
20,000 British soldiers
are moving towards Peking

13
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:02,697
Prince Dun your coat

14
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,606
Shut up!

15
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:05,533
Prince Dun was deeply
trusted by Empress Cixi

16
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:06,985
He built rail roads and factories

17
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:08,861
and modernized China's military

18
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:10,389
to fight against western armies...

19
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:11,155
Your Highness

20
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:12,240
4,000 soldiers in our
Bordered Blue Banner army

21
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:13,533
were defeated in Xin He

22
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,785
General Tu Er De committed suicide

23
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:19,581
Your Highness

24
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:20,586
Where are the firearms

25
00:01:20,707 --> 00:01:22,107
we bought to defeat the westerners?

26
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,334
There are minor problems with our firearms

27
00:01:23,543 --> 00:01:25,063
We still need half an hour to fix them

28
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:26,510
Here is the blueprint

29
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:27,130
Please take a look

30
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:28,548
Blueprint?

31
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:29,465
The Westerners are right at our door

32
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:30,717
You want me to look at the blueprint?

33
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,843
Take me to the Battalion

34
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:32,594
Yes sir

35
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:40,143
Please mind the step

36
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:56,659
What is that?

37
00:01:58,369 --> 00:01:59,787
Is that the Heaven's Wings?

38
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,080
Yes

39
00:02:01,456 --> 00:02:03,708
We can attack the enemy's camps by air

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,200
just like soldiers from heaven

41
00:02:05,752 --> 00:02:08,087
We can definitely sweep out those devils

42
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:09,816
"Starring Yuan Wen Kang as Prince Dun"

43
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:13,004
"The Iron King in the Qing Dynasty
Leader of the Self-Strengthening Movement"

44
00:02:21,476 --> 00:02:25,521
What ties does this have
with the leading characters in the story?

45
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:27,690
None

46
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:31,027
At least none for now

47
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,628
He is Yang Lu Chan

48
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,119
He faced many hardships in the last episode
but failed to learn Chen-style kung fu

49
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:53,966
But luck grows out of adversity

50
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:57,011
He will marry the Chen-style kung fu
Grandmaster's daughter Yu Niang

51
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:58,096
But

52
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:02,058
will he learn Chen-style
kung fu that easily?

53
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:03,976
Lu Chan!

54
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:15,279
Lu Chan

55
00:03:15,822 --> 00:03:17,615
Learn kung fu well from the master

56
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,200
Lu Chan!

57
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:22,245
Let's get this battle over with and eat

58
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:24,744
I'm looking for Master Chen

59
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:25,790
I want to learn Chen-style kung fu

60
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:27,758
Chen-style kung fu is
not taught to outsiders

61
00:03:31,838 --> 00:03:34,090
Once you've helped destroy the iron monster

62
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,467
you'll be a great hero to the Chen Village

63
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,553
Then it will be an easy matter

64
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:40,525
for you to learn our style of martial arts

65
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,015
Arrest them!

66
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:50,356
Yang Lu Chan did indeed steal our kung fu

67
00:03:50,523 --> 00:03:52,108
His kung fu has to be disabled
if he steals our family's kung fu

68
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,402
If he marries me

69
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:57,137
and takes our surname of Chen
he'll no longer be an outsider

70
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:28,394
First kowtow

71
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:32,607
Second kowtow

72
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,277
Third kowtow

73
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:39,822
Bring them to the bridal chamber

74
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:42,575
Wait!

75
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,310
Who's the intruder?

76
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:35,419
You don't recognize me?

77
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:38,548
My Big Brother!

78
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:40,107
My Big Brother!

79
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:41,425
Big Brother?

80
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,135
Big Brother!

81
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:47,682
You are finally back

82
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:49,976
Today is your wedding day

83
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:51,956
As your brother I've got to come back

84
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:52,979
Zai Yang

85
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:55,982
Starring Feng Shaofeng as Chen Zai Yang

86
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:07,326
Granduncle

87
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:09,662
You are finally back

88
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,447
Zai Yang is back!

89
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:46,032
Music!

90
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:06,552
Everybody

91
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,387
Cheers

92
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:12,600
Granduncle cheers

93
00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:14,685
Zai Yang

94
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:16,395
I can't imagine that

95
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:18,606
you used to be such a loafer

96
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,608
who caused trouble in our village

97
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:22,336
Even your dad thought you were hopeless

98
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,445
Now you are married and settled down

99
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,948
and brought a pretty wife to our family

100
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:29,742
She has been deaf and
mute since her childhood

101
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:33,037
Being a loafer

102
00:07:33,663 --> 00:07:34,664
was so miserable

103
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:38,250
But whenever I recalled the moment
when dad swore

104
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:41,671
I was frightened to come back

105
00:07:42,922 --> 00:07:43,839
Indeed

106
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:45,653
You two haven't met for over a decade

107
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,218
But he left without a word

108
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:49,345
Hey

109
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,199
why hasn't your husband come back yet?

110
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:00,606
What is he doing?

111
00:08:01,357 --> 00:08:03,067
Seems like he is hungry

112
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:06,070
Is he eating leaves?

113
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,113
I'll go stop him

114
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,783
Actually he is not born stupid

115
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,745
just the "Three Blossoms on the Crown"
has cost him lots of energy

116
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:17,039
so he acts foolish

117
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:18,833
No wonder he acts like this

118
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,627
In order to benefit
from "Three Blossoms on the Crown"

119
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:24,171
you need to practice
kung fu for over decades

120
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,628
This guy was born
with "Three Blossoms on the Crown"

121
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:28,259
but he was deeply hurt by it

122
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:30,302
We have to clear the energy channels
in his body

123
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,847
so that his energy and body
and mind are integrated

124
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:35,516
then he can live

125
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:39,478
and even become an unrivaled kung fu master

126
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:41,731
Him?

127
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,941
There's no problem for him
to fight common people

128
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:48,006
But to carry forward and further develop
the Chen-style kung fu

129
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:49,488
he has to rely on...

130
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:52,658
Rely on what?

131
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,540
Your Yin to be in harmony with his Yang

132
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:02,418
No I can't

133
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:04,211
I don't love him

134
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,504
I can't sleep with him

135
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:08,257
I don't get it

136
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:11,761
Yu Niang is very smart and pretty

137
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:16,057
Why did dad betroth her to such a fool?

138
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,730
We are forbidden to teach
Chen-style kung fu to an outsider

139
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:26,942
Has dad forgotten the Bronze Bell prophecy
left by the 10th Grandmaster?

140
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:29,445
What Bronze Bell Prophecy?

141
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:31,238
Why haven't I heard of it?

142
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:36,202
Why are you so harsh on Big Brother?

143
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,050
You even treat this idiot better than him

144
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,247
I know why you sent Second Brother out

145
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:41,040
You want to investigate...

146
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:42,083
So what he's back?

147
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,293
I know he acted wrong

148
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:46,087
but he deserves a chance

149
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:49,006
That won't help

150
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,134
He's still trashing himself

151
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,263
Can't you tell?

152
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:07,983
What are you laughing at?

153
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:10,277
As a kid I used to eat flowers
when I was hungry

154
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:11,737
My mom also beat me

155
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,781
Kneel down!

156
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:14,949
Kneel down?

157
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,201
Isn't this our wedding day?

158
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:18,536
Just kneel down when I tell you to

159
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:19,623
How dare you talk back?

160
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:27,702
We may be man and wife in name

161
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,255
but the reality's different

162
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:30,548
I've laid down some rules

163
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,466
You either abide or get out

164
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,135
First

165
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,177
I sleep on the bed

166
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:36,224
you sleep on the floor

167
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,847
If you dare come near my bed

168
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,223
I'll destroy you right away

169
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:40,516
Second

170
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:42,434
we may be man and wife in name

171
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,040
but in fact we're master and disciple

172
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,646
Whatever I say goes

173
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,398
Never question anything

174
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,441
I'm the only one you can learn from

175
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:52,153
You have objections?

176
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:54,405
No problem darling

177
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:55,155
Darling?

178
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:56,866
I mean Master

179
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,034
We'll start practicing now

180
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,703
Now?

181
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:07,084
Don't you think

182
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,628
your dad has

183
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,213
already

184
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:12,798
noticed?

185
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,351
Lower your stance

186
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,978
Stop hitting me!

187
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,229
Dare to talk back?

188
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,022
I'll kill you!

189
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:29,273
Carry on!

190
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:32,484
I am telling you

191
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:34,028
Lower your stance

192
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,339
How long do I need to keep this stance?

193
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:37,990
Until I'm happy

194
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:51,086
Big Brother it's me

195
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,054
You Zhi

196
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:03,044
you come to see me at this hour?

197
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,517
It's rather late

198
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:08,187
What's the matter?

199
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,773
Just tell me

200
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,776
What is the Bronze Bell Prophecy?

201
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,404
Does it have anything to do with the idiot?

202
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:22,451
You Zhi

203
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:26,359
You know our family's kung fu
can't be taught to outsiders

204
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,251
But what's the reason
for keeping it in the family?

205
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:31,585
You don't know yet

206
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:34,129
A hundred years ago

207
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:37,800
our 9th Grandmaster Chen Wang Ting
created our family's kung fu

208
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:41,095
Our 10th Grandmaster Chen
Suo Le flourished it

209
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,973
Our family became known in the region

210
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,349
and brought endless
challengers to our doors

211
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:48,185
countless people begging for instruction

212
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:57,861
Starring Patrick Tse as
the 10th Grandmaster

213
00:12:57,987 --> 00:12:59,780
A fortunate win

214
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:02,908
Our 10th Grandmaster
welcomed all challengers

215
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:04,410
If someone came from afar

216
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,098
he would give them traveling expenses

217
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:08,205
His generosity rivaled

218
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:12,001
One day a mad monk turned up

219
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:14,670
dressed in rags and acting ruthless

220
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,505
He carried a large bag on his back

221
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:17,840
to beg for alms

222
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,843
and installed himself in our ancestral hall

223
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,345
I'm starving

224
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:26,890
Bring out your best food and wine!

225
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:29,435
The mad monk had an enormous appetite

226
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:32,021
Each day he put away 10 pecks of rice
and 8 liters of wine

227
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:34,315
and copious amount of fruits and vegetables

228
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,358
Everybody wanted to send him on his way

229
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,485
but our 10th Grandmaster
said it was all right

230
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,029
We had plenty of food to spare

231
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,365
A fortnight passed

232
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:45,034
One day

233
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,369
the monk watched the disciples
practice Chen-style kung fu

234
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:48,078
The Tiger Style Grandmaster

235
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,872
and began snickering at them

236
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,915
The disciples couldn't bear it

237
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,542
and decided to teach him a lesson

238
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,971
You're a follower of Buddha

239
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,765
but you don't conduct yourself
in a befitting manner

240
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,391
I've treated you with respect

241
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:11,143
Why did you injure my disciples?

242
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,148
From his large bag

243
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:17,941
the monk brought out a man

244
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:19,947
whose limbs had been
folded back like a blanket

245
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:24,782
Wu Kui the Wind Chaser!

246
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,033
Indeed

247
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:27,242
This is Wu Kui

248
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,577
Your fine disciple

249
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,579
Thanks to your Chen-style kung fu

250
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:31,914
he killed burned raped and pillaged his way

251
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,082
throughout the provinces
of Shaanxi and Gansu

252
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,208
He took many lives

253
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,417
I apprehended him

254
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,169
I meant to come here

255
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,109
to settle the matter with his Master

256
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,297
But after living here for a fortnight

257
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,966
I found that Chen Villagers were honest
and simple folk

258
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,511
This fellow is a bad egg

259
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:46,637
But

260
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,347
YOU got to

261
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:49,890
make up for what he did

262
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,393
I'm grateful for your reverence

263
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:55,104
If you will hand him over to me

264
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:57,314
I'll rectify my wrong

265
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,378
The mad monk went back into the house

266
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:00,859
A huge bang

267
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,112
The Bronze Bell crashed through the wall

268
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,865
Since you can't distinguish good and bad

269
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:08,117
Heed my advice

270
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,785
be careful in accepting disciples

271
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:12,494
If someone of a different surname
learns your style

272
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,833
disaster will befall Chen Village

273
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,001
Remember my words!

274
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:21,380
Before the monk left

275
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,173
he left behind a prophecy

276
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:29,054
If outsiders learn the Chen-style disaster
shall befall the village

277
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:34,101
If the bell tolls at night
all the clan shall be obliterated

278
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:37,855
If the bell tolls at night
all the clan shall be obliterated?

279
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,189
What does that mean?

280
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,567
What it means is

281
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:44,114
that it's an omen of a
great impending disaster

282
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,239
After what happened

283
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,507
our 10th Grandmaster laid down the rules

284
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:52,661
that our style couldn't
be taught to outsiders

285
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:55,622
The rule's been broken!

286
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,998
Now that Yang Lu Chan has become
part of our family

287
00:15:58,542 --> 00:15:59,793
Doesn't that mean
the prophecy's been fulfilled?

288
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,200
He'll bring disaster to us all!

289
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:09,303
After the most inhumane
wedding night in history

290
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:11,013
Lu Chan was exhausted

291
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,556
He went out to look for food

292
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,642
Little did he know that overnight

293
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:20,105
the Chen villagers took
him as the black sheep

294
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:24,109
Brother Tofu

295
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:25,194
I'd like 5 bowls of tofu pudding

296
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:26,278
The stall's closed

297
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,371
I'd like 5 catties of
deep-fried dough sticks

298
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,033
What the hell?

299
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:32,451
Brother-in-law!

300
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:38,415
You're a native of Guang Ping?

301
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:40,225
Why have you come here to learn kung fu?

302
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:41,427
Because my mother...

303
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,504
told me to learn kung fu from Master Zhao

304
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,339
Master Zhao brought me
into the Divine Truth Cult

305
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:46,632
Then I met old Master Dong

306
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,635
Old Master Dong said that
I wasn't fit to practice anything

307
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,303
My only option is
to practice Chen-style kung fu

308
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:52,513
And so I came here

309
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:55,933
You spent time in the Divine Truth Cult?

310
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:57,935
Yes I fought in the vanguard

311
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:00,564
and beat the hell out
of a lot of imperial troops

312
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:01,313
Big Brother

313
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:02,973
You're really good at kung fu

314
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,107
Won't you teach me please?

315
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:08,695
Certainly

316
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:12,115
But there are no short cuts in kung fu

317
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:13,728
First you must perfect the basics

318
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:17,204
Our family style emphasizes
lower-body strength

319
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,707
Calm your heart and take a deep breath

320
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:27,814
That's awesome!

321
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:30,008
Power comes from the lower body

322
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,015
Your stance must be firm

323
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:44,606
Wow that's really awesome!

324
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,358
Teach me Big Brother

325
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:47,484
Big Brother

326
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:49,403
We've talked it over

327
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:50,946
Yang Lu Chan will bring disaster upon us

328
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:52,489
We must expel him from
the village immediately

329
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,287
What the hell?

330
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:01,540
Come with us

331
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:06,628
Big Brother help me

332
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,873
We can't let you bring disaster
upon the whole village

333
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,098
Brother-in-law your hat

334
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,069
Chen-style kung fu can't
be taught to outsiders

335
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,697
That's why only the Chen's may practice it

336
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:40,829
I am not interested

337
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:43,832
You can go a few rounds
with them if you like

338
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:52,382
This bell

339
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:53,829
has been here for over a century

340
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,802
We call it the Bronze Bell

341
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:57,332
It's meant for practicing kung fu

342
00:18:57,763 --> 00:18:59,222
but I've never seen them use it

343
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:00,015
Oh no!

344
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:01,224
This is bad!

345
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,851
The idiot's gone mad!

346
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:03,872
Sister-in-law

347
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:04,686
wait here

348
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:05,771
I'll be back in a moment

349
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:08,857
Come and help!

350
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,744
Chief Instigator

351
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,232
Accomplice in Violence

352
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:03,412
Accessory After the Fact

353
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:19,928
Put me down!

354
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:31,398
Lu Chan

355
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:46,121
Tianjin North Gate Outer Street

356
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,675
so this is what cost
Chen Zai Yang a fortune?

357
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:43,804
Are you Chen Zai Yang?

358
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:47,235
We've been waiting for you for a long time

359
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,059
I'm afraid you're mistaken

360
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:53,271
My surname's Fang

361
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:55,190
I'm a friend of Zai Yang's

362
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:56,358
His friend?

363
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:57,526
Excellent

364
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,444
He owes us a lot of money

365
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:01,363
The bank's been looking for him

366
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:02,280
Take him away!

367
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:03,528
He needs to be interrogated

368
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,367
I can take care of the money

369
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:07,536
Don't move!

370
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:13,416
Who is it?

371
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:15,627
Who's the intruder?

372
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:17,170
This is government property

373
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:18,213
Didn't you know that?

374
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,429
Are you blind?

375
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,265
This is Duke Fleming of
the East India Company

376
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,474
Don't you recognize him?

377
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:31,101
Your Grace

378
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:33,156
to what do we owe the honor of your visit?

379
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:35,981
He's my colleague

380
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:37,941
Release him

381
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:40,944
Oh certainly

382
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:42,946
Release him!

383
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:45,490
He said release him!

384
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:59,212
This isn't about me

385
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:04,384
But all I can see in front of me
is a sore looser

386
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:09,681
raging because somebody
wrecked his favorite toy

387
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,060
Oh by the way

388
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:18,607
the East India Company

389
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:25,864
demands uh... thirteen thousand taels
for the mess of Troy

390
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:32,078
And furthermore our helpful chap Jiang

391
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:34,080
wanted to see you dead

392
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:38,126
Fortunately I stepped in just before

393
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:43,632
Prince Dun ordered your execution

394
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:10,408
it looks like we really have to let him go

395
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:13,703
Why?

396
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:16,153
All because of a stupid legend?

397
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:17,653
Look what it's done to all of us

398
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:21,628
Dear sister

399
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,213
marriage isn't a children's game

400
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,100
It's an important decision you make in life

401
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:27,133
You deserve much better

402
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:31,721
He saved my life

403
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,435
That's ridiculous

404
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:39,854
Just because he saved you

405
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:41,564
you have to express your gratitude

406
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:42,524
by marrying him?

407
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:43,900
You must love him

408
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,947
just like you loved Fang Zi Jing

409
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:23,606
You

410
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:24,744
You need to focus!

411
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:25,692
Your form's all over the place

412
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:26,651
Says who?

413
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:28,139
I know the entire form inside-out

414
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:29,834
I can even practice the routine backwards

415
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:30,947
How dare you talk back!

416
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:36,870
Let go!

417
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:43,043
Hey!

418
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:48,590
Grandmaster

419
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:50,175
I've angered my Master

420
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:53,478
The day your Master stops
being angry at you

421
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:54,596
that's when you've perfected your kung fu

422
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:55,305
Come on

423
00:25:58,266 --> 00:25:59,059
There's one thing

424
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,060
I don't understand

425
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:02,228
You're the Grandmaster

426
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:04,230
Why are you always dressed in rags?

427
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:08,151
Whenever I appear as the Grandmaster

428
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:10,153
everyone acts nothing but courteous

429
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:12,072
I can't see the other side of them

430
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:15,742
Dressed up like this no
one will recognize me

431
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:17,952
It allows me to see my true self

432
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:19,496
Howdy Grandmaster

433
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:23,083
Chen-style kung fu comes from daily life

434
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,793
and is integrated into life

435
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:27,629
The way to live life

436
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:30,173
is to adapt to nature and learn from it

437
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:32,133
That is how you reach harmony in life

438
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:35,929
That is the way of TAICHI

439
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:38,515
and the principle behind
our martial arts style

440
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:40,100
To live life...

441
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:41,935
In that case

442
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:43,603
eat drink

443
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:45,021
shit and fart

444
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,731
all of that is related to kung fu?

445
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:56,449
It's turning a lighter color

446
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,702
No wonder your brain's working better

447
00:27:57,802 --> 00:28:01,639
Her body was sent back to England
as regard to her wishes

448
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:06,019
I buried her clothes and shoes
and erected this stone

449
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,104
at least

450
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:10,982
I have a place to go to remember her

451
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,903
We can't let them get away with this

452
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:20,158
I let her down Fleming

453
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:21,993
I gotta make it right

454
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:27,040
They recently gave you sound trashing

455
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:32,712
What on earth makes you believe
that you can beat them now huh?

456
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:35,256
I was too soft

457
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:38,885
This time there'll be no mercy

458
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:43,014
When it comes to our dear friend Jiang

459
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:45,683
what do you propose huh?

460
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:50,897
After all he's in charge of all matters
regarding the rail road

461
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:55,735
Swine like him will ruin this country

462
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:57,153
If we let him go

463
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,113
the rail road will fail

464
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:03,743
Fleming

465
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,703
I need your help

466
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:09,040
Please

467
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,489
Father

468
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,157
You're finally home

469
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:45,910
What's happened with Lu
Chan is really serious

470
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,840
You need to come forward and say something

471
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:55,529
This 1000-year-old rhizome's been
handed down in our family

472
00:29:57,171 --> 00:30:00,550
Hold on to it for me

473
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:03,094
Give it to Zai Yang tomorrow

474
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,516
Why?

475
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:15,690
Yu Niang

476
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:18,443
Go

477
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:21,654
The truth shall soon be revealed

478
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:31,080
What the hell?

479
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:34,208
Why is the Bronze Bell ringing?

480
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:55,480
What's going on?

481
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:57,607
The Bronze Bell rings

482
00:30:58,649 --> 00:30:59,400
Granduncle

483
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,653
It bodes the end of our village

484
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:08,034
Granduncle

485
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,286
Granduncle

486
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:11,621
You

487
00:31:12,163 --> 00:31:12,955
Go away

488
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:14,165
Get out of here

489
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:15,792
We can't allow you to stay in our Village

490
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:17,502
Otherwise disasters are coming

491
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:48,658
Hands

492
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:51,953
Stroke

493
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:52,870
Squeeze

494
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:53,913
Push

495
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:55,957
Pull

496
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:57,875
Twist

497
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:00,128
Elbow

498
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:00,878
Lean

499
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:01,545
Advance

500
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:02,338
Retreat

501
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,172
Look right

502
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:03,965
Glance left

503
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:05,842
Hold

504
00:32:11,097 --> 00:32:13,057
Connect the front with the back

505
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:17,395
Coordinated and consistent

506
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:37,457
Good

507
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:41,210
Great

508
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:09,530
Your kung fu is not bad

509
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,491
Much better than your husband

510
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:13,915
But unfortunately you
fell into the wrong path

511
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:16,037
What machine have you installed

512
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:17,914
to make the Bronze Bell turn so fast?

513
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,181
Both for the safety of our village

514
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:36,891
and for the future of our kids

515
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:38,768
Yang Lu Chan must be expelled

516
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,687
Expel him from our village

517
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:42,897
Are you all crazy?

518
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:44,649
In today's world

519
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:46,609
you still believe in superstition

520
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:48,402
There must be someone
who manipulates the whole thing

521
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:49,153
Everybody

522
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:51,489
Today our village is facing
significant challenges

523
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:53,699
As the eldest son

524
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:55,308
he should be the lead of the family

525
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:56,619
Zai Yang

526
00:34:05,545 --> 00:34:06,671
Thanks Granduncle

527
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:08,756
Unfortunately I have

528
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:09,924
great ambition but little talent

529
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:11,209
I am ignorant and incompetent

530
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:12,802
I'm afraid

531
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:14,804
I can't do that

532
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:22,270
However

533
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:24,105
if you insist

534
00:34:24,772 --> 00:34:27,024
I will definitely try my best

535
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:29,569
to take care of our family

536
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:32,154
Yes

537
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:32,905
No way

538
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:34,615
How can you make such a decision
in my dad's absence?

539
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:35,658
Of course we can

540
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:38,703
The Grandmaster is elected
by the 8 elders of our family

541
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:39,745
Your dad has made mistakes

542
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:42,039
The 8 elders can dismiss him

543
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:43,499
I can fire him in his absence

544
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:44,333
and even if he is here

545
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,251
I...

546
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:46,502
Who says I am absent?

547
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:50,089
Dad

548
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:56,304
Okay

549
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:57,448
Many years ago

550
00:34:57,555 --> 00:34:58,795
when you became the Grandmaster

551
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:00,182
you claimed to abide
by the rules set by our ancestors

552
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:01,546
Now do you have anything to say?

553
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:03,478
Please don't dismiss him

554
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:04,562
I will leave the village

555
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:08,608
You are really disgusting

556
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:11,902
You are not qualified
to take care of our family

557
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:14,238
Tell us

558
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:18,492
who asked you to come
back and cause troubles?

559
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:26,250
This is the telegram Geng
Yun sent from Tianjin

560
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:29,837
The day when you came back home

561
00:35:30,004 --> 00:35:31,797
I felt something was not right

562
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:34,800
So I asked Geng Yun
to get medicines from Tianjin

563
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:37,553
In fact his real mission
was to investigate you

564
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:39,055
As it turns out

565
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:41,432
he's made contact with Fang Zi Jing

566
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:43,559
No I didn't

567
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:45,603
Enough

568
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:46,812
In a word

569
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:48,522
you would rather abuse your son

570
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:50,316
but protect Yang Lu Chan right?

571
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:54,070
Last chance for you

572
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:57,198
Tell us the truth

573
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,576
Dad

574
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:04,080
I don't quite get you

575
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,083
Come here

576
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:10,086
Fight with him to see his kung fu skills

577
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:11,253
What?

578
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:14,548
He can kill me easily

579
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:18,094
Just do as I say

580
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:24,558
Go!

581
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:46,330
Lean slightly

582
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:00,761
Hands in front of your abdomen

583
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:02,638
Go

584
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:16,902
No easy way out for him

585
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:23,534
Big Brother's kung fu is supposed
to be very solid

586
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:25,421
His push should be equivalent to over 50 KG

587
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:26,746
But how come he is so weak?

588
00:38:33,938 --> 00:38:35,564
Dad it's my turn

589
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:40,069
Dad

590
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:41,278
Let me show it to you

591
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:42,363
Very good

592
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:13,519
Dad! Zai Yang is great!

593
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:14,937
I want to be as good as him

594
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:30,870
Dad

595
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:32,371
Dad

596
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:34,957
Dad help me

597
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:37,793
I can't stop

598
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,128
Dad

599
00:40:05,863 --> 00:40:07,781
Dad!

600
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:14,622
Big Brother

601
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:16,624
Forget it

602
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:21,337
He is hopeless

603
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:33,140
Big Brother why did you do that?

604
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:40,022
I just don't like practicing kung fu

605
00:40:46,946 --> 00:40:48,238
We are in a new world now

606
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:50,991
Westerners invaded us with modern weapons

607
00:40:51,075 --> 00:40:52,952
We are still fighting here with kung fu

608
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,706
I like making machines

609
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,668
The more machines I produced

610
00:41:01,502 --> 00:41:03,087
the more debt I had

611
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:06,340
The government wanted
to shut down my factory

612
00:41:07,216 --> 00:41:07,883
Fang Zi Jing said that

613
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,510
he could help me

614
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:12,221
provided that

615
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:16,058
I had to come back to our village

616
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:17,601
and replace dad

617
00:41:22,398 --> 00:41:23,899
I thought it over

618
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:27,903
I had to distribute the
crazy monk's prophecy

619
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:30,322
Then I might have a chance

620
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:57,391
Shameful

621
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,019
That's so shameful

622
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:24,585
Big Brother

623
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:26,211
Big Brother

624
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:35,763
Take it

625
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:42,853
This is our family's Thousand Year Rhizome

626
00:42:44,188 --> 00:42:45,606
Why did you bring it here?

627
00:42:46,106 --> 00:42:46,815
Don't worry

628
00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:49,068
Take it to the medicine shop in Tianjin
to see how much it's worth

629
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:50,736
and exchange it for money

630
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:59,247
I didn't look after you well
as your Big Brother

631
00:43:09,338 --> 00:43:10,964
I let you down

632
00:44:09,189 --> 00:44:10,440
Do you want to revolt?

633
00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:29,835
Zi Jing!

634
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:41,346
According to the governor of Zhi Li

635
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:45,411
Jiang Yan Hao the deputy governor
of Henan violated disciplines

636
00:44:45,726 --> 00:44:47,519
We have solid evidences of his corruption

637
00:44:47,644 --> 00:44:49,445
Now send him to prison
and put him in custody

638
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,857
He will be replaced by the Chief Engineer
of Zhi Li rail road

639
00:44:52,024 --> 00:44:53,609
Fang Zi Jing

640
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:55,736
The order takes effect now

641
00:44:55,903 --> 00:44:57,196
Nobody can argue with it

642
00:44:57,654 --> 00:44:59,323
This is the order from the governor

643
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,702
I want to appeal to the governor

644
00:45:05,913 --> 00:45:07,664
I paid 30,000 taels to get this job

645
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,926
The East India Company
paid 50,000 taels for me

646
00:45:20,093 --> 00:45:21,803
Whoever paid less

647
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:24,765
goes to prison

648
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:28,769
Take him away

649
00:45:30,187 --> 00:45:31,355
Go

650
00:45:32,105 --> 00:45:33,065
Fang Zi Jing

651
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:33,941
Go

652
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,802
Why are you out here this late?

653
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:05,764
I was thinking of Big Brother

654
00:46:06,515 --> 00:46:07,641
I couldn't sleep

655
00:46:08,225 --> 00:46:09,625
Then I got up and practiced kung fu

656
00:46:09,935 --> 00:46:11,103
Big Brother left

657
00:46:12,896 --> 00:46:14,898
I don't know when I can see him again

658
00:46:27,077 --> 00:46:28,620
Excuse me how much is the bun?

659
00:46:29,037 --> 00:46:30,122
One coin

660
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:34,501
You want one?

661
00:46:42,342 --> 00:46:43,182
Let's get out of here

662
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:47,264
Fang Zi Jing promised me to get it done

663
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:49,099
Why is it still sealed?

664
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:51,518
That bastard

665
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:11,515
Didn't you say not to remove the seals?

666
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:39,835
Look at me

667
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:47,134
Wimp

668
00:48:52,431 --> 00:48:54,307
You are the deputy governor?

669
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:55,725
How dare you?

670
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:56,560
Kneel down

671
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:04,943
You promised me that

672
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:07,278
you could sort out the problem
in the Chen Village

673
00:49:07,696 --> 00:49:08,572
Did you get it done?

674
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:10,991
You also promised to get my factory back

675
00:49:13,118 --> 00:49:13,994
What?

676
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:17,247
You took my money

677
00:49:18,248 --> 00:49:19,875
It's been awhile

678
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:23,211
What task have you fulfilled?

679
00:49:28,467 --> 00:49:29,634
Torture this woman

680
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:30,552
Yes!

681
00:49:32,471 --> 00:49:33,180
Fang Zi Jing

682
00:49:33,346 --> 00:49:34,181
Torture me instead

683
00:49:34,473 --> 00:49:36,600
A great man won't torture a lady

684
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:41,605
I was kicked around by you in my childhood

685
00:49:42,564 --> 00:49:44,274
I have never been a great man

686
00:49:44,608 --> 00:49:46,526
and for all you have done to my childhood

687
00:49:48,487 --> 00:49:50,405
It's payback time

688
00:49:51,907 --> 00:49:52,949
Beat her

689
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:54,334
Hang on for a minute

690
00:49:54,993 --> 00:49:56,119
We have done all we could

691
00:49:56,286 --> 00:49:57,621
We have tried our best

692
00:49:57,787 --> 00:49:59,372
I was almost there

693
00:50:00,624 --> 00:50:02,083
But my dad discovered everything

694
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:04,586
Besides I was defeated by Yang Lu Chan

695
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,379
There's nothing we could do

696
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:07,464
All this time you spent planning

697
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:09,190
you were defeated by a mere Yang Lu Chan

698
00:50:10,926 --> 00:50:11,968
Well

699
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:14,179
His kung fu is very good

700
00:50:14,721 --> 00:50:16,241
He used to be in the Divine Truth Cult

701
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:17,349
And he was taught by my dad

702
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:18,183
so I couldn't defeat him for sure

703
00:50:18,308 --> 00:50:19,351
Divine Truth Cult?

704
00:50:19,518 --> 00:50:20,268
Yes

705
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:23,230
He was in the vanguard
of Divine Truth Cult's army

706
00:50:23,438 --> 00:50:24,648
Furthermore he was in a battle
with our Green Battalion

707
00:50:25,524 --> 00:50:26,650
Then

708
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:28,443
His army broke up

709
00:50:28,568 --> 00:50:29,861
He went to the Chen Village

710
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:30,737
to look for...

711
00:50:30,904 --> 00:50:31,696
Interesting

712
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,032
Yang Lu Chan was a member
of the Divine Truth Cult

713
00:50:34,157 --> 00:50:35,784
Divine Truth Cult is a rebel force

714
00:50:36,326 --> 00:50:37,536
As a rebel

715
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:39,204
he hides in the Chen Village

716
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:41,998
The Chen Village harbors the criminal

717
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:44,668
Chen Zai Yang

718
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:47,013
You have made great contributions this time

719
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:51,299
Fang Zi Jing

720
00:50:55,887 --> 00:50:58,181
You told us that you just wanted
to build rail roads

721
00:50:59,558 --> 00:51:00,850
What do you really want to do?

722
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,730
I also said that I would repay your debt

723
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:06,731
Get them out of here

724
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:10,068
Fang Zi Jing

725
00:51:10,402 --> 00:51:11,987
What do you really want to do?

726
00:51:12,279 --> 00:51:13,029
Fang Zi Jing

727
00:51:13,196 --> 00:51:13,822
You!

728
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:25,792
This is kung fu training?

729
00:51:26,126 --> 00:51:27,252
Shut up

730
00:51:28,587 --> 00:51:29,296
Okay

731
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:31,214
Follow what I do

732
00:51:31,548 --> 00:51:32,716
Deeply breathe in

733
00:51:33,425 --> 00:51:34,634
Slowly breathe out

734
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:39,431
Okay do it again slowly

735
00:51:40,056 --> 00:51:42,017
Deeply breathe in

736
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:44,519
Slowly breathe out

737
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:02,621
I got it

738
00:52:07,917 --> 00:52:10,170
Now I understand why she is not happy

739
00:52:15,508 --> 00:52:16,384
Grandmaster

740
00:52:18,595 --> 00:52:20,472
When you know how to observe properly

741
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:23,308
you have learned it all

742
00:53:04,057 --> 00:53:05,892
Great! Destroy it!

743
00:53:18,571 --> 00:53:18,905
Idiot

744
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:19,790
What are you doing?

745
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:23,576
This western thing pisses you off

746
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:25,123
I will beat him for you

747
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:51,813
Yang Lu Chan

748
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:55,024
Come home

749
00:54:02,782 --> 00:54:05,034
Master I am not done yet

750
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:06,619
It's time for dinner

751
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:07,579
Okay

752
00:54:27,432 --> 00:54:28,391
Ready

753
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:29,559
Fire

754
00:54:36,107 --> 00:54:37,650
The western cannon is awesome

755
00:54:37,901 --> 00:54:39,486
It is even better than the red cannon

756
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:40,653
Of course

757
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:42,280
This is

758
00:54:42,322 --> 00:54:43,072
Governor of Zhi Li

759
00:54:43,114 --> 00:54:44,824
German-made Krupp cannon

760
00:54:45,158 --> 00:54:46,868
It Weighs 50,000 KG

761
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:49,454
and ranges over 8,000 meters

762
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:53,666
The red cannon is rubbish compared to it

763
00:54:54,751 --> 00:54:56,294
2nd round get ready

764
00:54:56,795 --> 00:54:58,087
Load up shells

765
00:54:58,296 --> 00:54:59,172
Ready

766
00:55:00,173 --> 00:55:00,840
Fire

767
00:55:03,426 --> 00:55:04,552
Governor

768
00:55:05,261 --> 00:55:07,931
The problem in the Chen Village
is still not fixed

769
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:10,767
If we can deploy the Sheng Ji Battalion

770
00:55:11,184 --> 00:55:13,812
and use these western cannons

771
00:55:14,187 --> 00:55:17,023
the problem can be sorted out easily

772
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,274
Mr. Fang

773
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:20,860
50,000 taels

774
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:22,821
was just enough to buy your current job

775
00:55:23,154 --> 00:55:25,156
It does not include moving our troops

776
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:27,867
Governor

777
00:55:28,117 --> 00:55:29,244
Please take a look

778
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:34,749
11,470 taels

779
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:45,301
Sheng Ji Battalion is our elite royal army

780
00:55:45,885 --> 00:55:48,054
It can't be deployed easily

781
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:49,472
You need to

782
00:55:49,681 --> 00:55:51,683
have the approval from Prince Dun

783
00:55:51,933 --> 00:55:54,477
as well as the consents from ministers

784
00:55:55,937 --> 00:55:57,564
3rd round get ready

785
00:55:58,022 --> 00:55:58,731
Governor

786
00:55:59,148 --> 00:55:59,899
Please

787
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:02,277
Ready fire

788
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:04,320
You are very well connected

789
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,364
There must be a way

790
00:56:06,614 --> 00:56:09,075
Heard of the proverb that an army
needs a good reason for waging a war?

791
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:11,369
As long as we have the right excuse

792
00:56:11,995 --> 00:56:14,205
everything will be easy

793
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:20,920
What if we are to put down the rebellion?

794
00:56:31,306 --> 00:56:33,308
I just had a nightmare

795
00:56:34,851 --> 00:56:36,412
In the dream a disaster came to my home

796
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:46,529
Sell this tomorrow morning

797
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:48,615
Just sell it without bargaining

798
00:56:57,624 --> 00:56:58,666
You want

799
00:56:58,833 --> 00:56:59,792
to fix

800
00:56:59,959 --> 00:57:01,628
the Heaven's Wings?

801
00:57:02,378 --> 00:57:03,630
No

802
00:57:03,796 --> 00:57:04,964
I want

803
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:06,299
to build

804
00:57:06,466 --> 00:57:07,759
a new

805
00:57:07,926 --> 00:57:09,385
Heaven's Wings

806
00:57:33,993 --> 00:57:35,828
Good night Master

807
00:57:47,215 --> 00:57:48,800
Don't sleep on the floor tonight

808
00:57:49,217 --> 00:57:49,968
Sleep on the bed

809
00:57:56,808 --> 00:57:58,518
I said sleep on the bed

810
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:15,243
No the other way around

811
00:58:22,792 --> 00:58:24,002
Sorry Master

812
00:58:24,627 --> 00:58:25,837
Don't call me Master

813
00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:27,296
Call me darling

814
00:58:28,423 --> 00:58:29,882
Yes Master

815
00:58:33,428 --> 00:58:35,179
Yes darling

816
00:58:37,265 --> 00:58:38,745
Darling what are you touching me for?

817
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:39,934
Shut up

818
00:58:59,871 --> 00:59:02,248
Pushing-hand is the basic skill
of our family's kung fu

819
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:05,793
There is a principle that all the movements
should be coordinated

820
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,837
integrated and consistent

821
00:59:08,087 --> 00:59:09,922
It means that you should respect the nature

822
00:59:10,131 --> 00:59:11,841
and beat Yang with Yin

823
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:48,437
Governor

824
01:00:48,604 --> 01:00:49,147
We

825
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:50,481
No rush

826
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,026
Let's test the cannon first

827
01:00:57,029 --> 01:00:57,780
Fire

828
01:01:34,025 --> 01:01:34,525
Dad

829
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:35,818
We are being attacked

830
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:41,199
Lu Chan

831
01:01:41,449 --> 01:01:42,033
Come over.

832
01:01:53,294 --> 01:01:54,295
It's gone?

833
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:57,506
Yes it's gone

834
01:02:03,179 --> 01:02:04,597
The troops are coming

835
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:05,609
What should we do?

836
01:02:06,849 --> 01:02:07,892
Dress up

837
01:02:08,351 --> 01:02:09,268
Have a good breakfast

838
01:02:09,769 --> 01:02:10,811
then we turn ourselves in

839
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:12,104
You are right

840
01:02:13,272 --> 01:02:14,065
Yu Niang

841
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,733
Go to the kitchen

842
01:02:15,983 --> 01:02:17,026
Prepare the breakfast

843
01:02:23,157 --> 01:02:24,200
One more round?

844
01:02:28,371 --> 01:02:28,996
Yes one more

845
01:02:30,248 --> 01:02:30,790
One more

846
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:32,583
One more

847
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:35,962
The prophecy is fulfilled

848
01:02:48,349 --> 01:02:49,910
People in the Chen Village listen to me

849
01:02:50,226 --> 01:02:52,507
If you don't hand over the rebels
in the Divine Truth Cult

850
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:53,201
or the criminals

851
01:02:53,271 --> 01:02:56,023
namely Yang Lu Chan and Chen Chang Xing
and Chen Yu Niang

852
01:02:56,315 --> 01:02:58,985
we will totally demolish your village

853
01:03:06,284 --> 01:03:07,076
Dad

854
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:08,202
The troops are here

855
01:03:08,411 --> 01:03:10,162
they claim to arrest the rebels
in the Divine Truth Cult

856
01:03:10,371 --> 01:03:11,580
Let's fight them

857
01:03:11,998 --> 01:03:13,207
I know

858
01:03:13,749 --> 01:03:16,043
Let me talk to Lu Chan and Yu Niang

859
01:03:16,252 --> 01:03:17,670
privately

860
01:03:30,725 --> 01:03:32,643
Fang Zi Jing came this time

861
01:03:33,144 --> 01:03:34,812
with a large number of troops

862
01:03:36,105 --> 01:03:38,357
He even framed us as rebels

863
01:03:39,317 --> 01:03:41,319
Obviously our village is facing carnage

864
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:43,654
We can survive

865
01:03:43,946 --> 01:03:46,198
But our fellow villagers will be involved

866
01:03:46,449 --> 01:03:48,117
They may even die

867
01:03:48,576 --> 01:03:50,056
The only choice at the moment is that

868
01:03:50,244 --> 01:03:51,746
I surrender myself to Fang Zi Jing

869
01:03:52,288 --> 01:03:53,456
and you escape from here

870
01:03:53,998 --> 01:03:56,709
Hopefully this plan can
save the Chen Village

871
01:03:57,043 --> 01:03:57,668
No

872
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,045
You can't go alone

873
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:00,570
Our village's existence is at stake

874
01:04:00,755 --> 01:04:03,075
If the plan can help hundreds of people
and keep them alive

875
01:04:03,341 --> 01:04:04,592
This is what I should do

876
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:14,977
Lu Chan and Yu Niang listen to me

877
01:04:18,522 --> 01:04:20,232
Once you get through the siege

878
01:04:20,566 --> 01:04:21,966
you should go to Peking immediately

879
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:24,153
and look for Master Li Qian Kun

880
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,739
Maybe it can turn things around

881
01:05:03,734 --> 01:05:04,568
Surround them

882
01:05:41,814 --> 01:05:43,941
Deputy governor

883
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:45,860
Please forgive me

884
01:05:46,068 --> 01:05:47,820
for not welcoming you

885
01:05:49,905 --> 01:05:52,116
The Chen Village is absolutely not
the home of rebels

886
01:05:52,283 --> 01:05:53,951
There must be some misunderstanding

887
01:05:54,201 --> 01:05:56,162
You can arrest me

888
01:05:56,996 --> 01:05:59,081
But I wish that you wouldn't

889
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:01,208
hurt our fellow villagers

890
01:06:02,084 --> 01:06:03,085
On the list

891
01:06:03,836 --> 01:06:05,504
only three of you are criminals

892
01:06:06,005 --> 01:06:07,798
If you three surrender

893
01:06:08,424 --> 01:06:10,968
I won't hurt anybody else

894
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:14,638
Perhaps I didn't speak clearly

895
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:17,349
or maybe you didn't hear me

896
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:19,643
I am the only person who surrenders

897
01:06:20,144 --> 01:06:21,395
Grandmaster Chen

898
01:06:22,855 --> 01:06:24,690
What are you trying to pull?

899
01:06:25,441 --> 01:06:27,443
How dare I?

900
01:06:29,361 --> 01:06:32,531
My daughter and her husband
couldn't get along with me

901
01:06:32,865 --> 01:06:35,659
so they are going to Lu
Chan's parents' home

902
01:06:36,202 --> 01:06:38,370
I don't want to talk to you peasants

903
01:06:38,871 --> 01:06:40,206
I won't be fooled by you

904
01:06:42,166 --> 01:06:43,083
Arrest them

905
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:48,756
Aim

906
01:06:49,089 --> 01:06:49,589
Up

907
01:06:49,632 --> 01:06:50,549
Shoot!

908
01:06:53,052 --> 01:06:54,136
Stop shooting

909
01:06:54,803 --> 01:06:56,055
Get out of here if possible

910
01:06:56,555 --> 01:06:57,431
Be careful

911
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:22,248
Protect me

912
01:07:36,387 --> 01:07:37,012
Soldiers

913
01:07:37,137 --> 01:07:37,972
Why are you still standing there?

914
01:07:38,055 --> 01:07:39,139
Arrest him

915
01:08:41,327 --> 01:08:42,494
I am the deputy governor

916
01:08:42,661 --> 01:08:43,621
Don't do anything stupid

917
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:45,414
I know

918
01:08:54,506 --> 01:08:56,634
I am the deputy governor

919
01:08:57,718 --> 01:08:59,053
Get out of here if possible

920
01:09:00,471 --> 01:09:02,139
Do you really think that is an option?

921
01:09:22,076 --> 01:09:24,703
Out of the way!

922
01:09:37,424 --> 01:09:38,634
Lu Chan watch out!

923
01:09:58,946 --> 01:10:00,072
Chen Zai Yang

924
01:10:16,797 --> 01:10:17,506
Soldiers

925
01:10:18,048 --> 01:10:19,800
Shoot down that thing

926
01:10:25,723 --> 01:10:27,307
You can't shoot me down

927
01:10:33,731 --> 01:10:35,315
Use the cannon

928
01:10:36,692 --> 01:10:38,026
Hurry!

929
01:10:38,152 --> 01:10:39,361
Use the cannon

930
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:10,434
Hurry and fire its rear!

931
01:11:10,976 --> 01:11:12,186
Turn the cannon

932
01:11:12,352 --> 01:11:14,313
Hurry and turn it

933
01:11:18,734 --> 01:11:19,485
Lu Chan

934
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:21,278
Bring Yu Niang to go with Zai Yang

935
01:11:30,788 --> 01:11:32,164
Go to Peking to sue Fang Zi Jing!

936
01:11:32,289 --> 01:11:32,873
Go

937
01:11:39,046 --> 01:11:40,172
Stop them

938
01:11:48,138 --> 01:11:49,681
Come on

939
01:12:04,196 --> 01:12:04,947
Give me the gun

940
01:12:08,951 --> 01:12:09,785
Hey Wimp

941
01:12:09,952 --> 01:12:12,996
Suck on this

942
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:15,791
Milk!

943
01:12:50,784 --> 01:12:51,784
We're running out of fuel

944
01:13:16,518 --> 01:13:17,853
We're running out of fuel

945
01:13:19,813 --> 01:13:20,772
Well

946
01:13:21,356 --> 01:13:22,900
We are too heavy

947
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:24,776
The Heaven's Wings can't sustain
the weight of 3 people

948
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:27,404
You will be safe after
we fly over the forest

949
01:13:27,613 --> 01:13:28,697
Hold firmly

950
01:13:30,574 --> 01:13:31,867
I must go

951
01:13:35,162 --> 01:13:37,205
Zai Yang

952
01:14:05,692 --> 01:14:07,402
Hold...

953
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:11,281
one two three

954
01:14:14,785 --> 01:14:15,953
Prince

955
01:14:16,203 --> 01:14:18,080
I'm sorry it's no good... he blinked

956
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:20,248
Tell him we have to do it again

957
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:22,918
and this time please try not to blink

958
01:14:24,586 --> 01:14:25,796
Prince please cool down

959
01:14:26,713 --> 01:14:27,881
What's the matter?

960
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:30,092
Sorry you blinked again

961
01:14:30,592 --> 01:14:31,593
We have to do it again

962
01:14:38,767 --> 01:14:40,647
It's so boring to have
only myself in the photo

963
01:14:40,686 --> 01:14:41,436
Master Li

964
01:14:41,853 --> 01:14:42,396
Come here

965
01:14:42,688 --> 01:14:43,848
Take a photo with me together

966
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:45,732
Prince

967
01:14:46,233 --> 01:14:47,442
I heard that this stuff

968
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:49,236
can take our soul

969
01:14:49,569 --> 01:14:50,529
lam an unlucky guy

970
01:14:51,196 --> 01:14:52,322
Sorry I can't do it

971
01:14:52,823 --> 01:14:53,490
Come on

972
01:14:53,949 --> 01:14:54,700
Be brave

973
01:14:54,825 --> 01:14:55,534
Prince

974
01:14:56,451 --> 01:14:57,285
Prince

975
01:15:00,122 --> 01:15:01,248
Divine Truth Cult?

976
01:15:02,791 --> 01:15:04,271
Wasn't it suppressed a long time ago?

977
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:06,459
How come some of their members
are still out there?

978
01:15:07,254 --> 01:15:08,714
Even if they come here

979
01:15:09,131 --> 01:15:09,891
you shouldn't worry

980
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:11,758
We have Master Li

981
01:15:12,009 --> 01:15:12,718
I am not afraid

982
01:15:13,385 --> 01:15:13,969
Go

983
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:18,557
Take another photo

984
01:15:19,141 --> 01:15:20,684
One two three

985
01:15:20,809 --> 01:15:21,727
say cheese

986
01:15:32,404 --> 01:15:33,321
Sir

987
01:15:46,543 --> 01:15:47,711
Fleming

988
01:15:49,671 --> 01:15:53,216
I want revenge

989
01:15:53,675 --> 01:15:57,471
In order to get revenge
you have to stay alive

990
01:15:59,681 --> 01:16:01,433
Take him to the institution

991
01:16:09,274 --> 01:16:10,484
What should we do now?

992
01:16:39,596 --> 01:16:41,014
The Bird Man is coming

993
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:42,099
Hurry UP

994
01:16:42,891 --> 01:16:43,892
Be careful

995
01:16:45,185 --> 01:16:46,770
Look I am handcuffed

996
01:16:46,937 --> 01:16:47,938
Do you think I can escape from here?

997
01:16:48,146 --> 01:16:49,906
Well you flew very well
just now didn't you?

998
01:16:51,316 --> 01:16:52,067
Get in there

999
01:16:52,234 --> 01:16:53,110
Guard this prisoner

1000
01:16:56,613 --> 01:16:58,031
Can you be a bit more careful?

1001
01:17:10,669 --> 01:17:12,212
You dared go against me in the past

1002
01:17:13,046 --> 01:17:15,423
Now you should be brave enough
to cover the consequences

1003
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:21,304
I am a loser

1004
01:17:23,014 --> 01:17:24,307
I am not successful

1005
01:17:26,393 --> 01:17:27,561
I've made lots of mistakes

1006
01:17:29,813 --> 01:17:31,523
Just now it was so dangerous

1007
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,527
Without you or your machine

1008
01:17:36,653 --> 01:17:38,029
Lu Chan and Yu Niang

1009
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:39,698
would have been killed for sure

1010
01:17:44,619 --> 01:17:46,079
I should apologize to you

1011
01:17:47,789 --> 01:17:48,415
Dad

1012
01:17:48,915 --> 01:17:50,917
I have never accepted you for who you are

1013
01:17:52,252 --> 01:17:54,212
I have never spoken highly of you

1014
01:17:55,046 --> 01:17:56,339
It's my fault

1015
01:17:57,924 --> 01:18:00,284
I have always wanted to go
against the elders in my lifetime

1016
01:18:01,303 --> 01:18:02,971
But I am not brave enough

1017
01:18:06,099 --> 01:18:08,602
to break the rules set by our ancestors

1018
01:18:12,189 --> 01:18:13,773
Everyone has his own ambition

1019
01:18:14,524 --> 01:18:16,651
It's okay that you don't like kung fu

1020
01:18:17,235 --> 01:18:20,113
But you have cheated us

1021
01:18:21,156 --> 01:18:22,866
You are unworthy of being in our family

1022
01:18:24,659 --> 01:18:26,077
Do you think I care?

1023
01:18:27,162 --> 01:18:28,371
You claimed not to pressure me

1024
01:18:29,122 --> 01:18:30,642
But you abused everytime I do drawings

1025
01:18:32,626 --> 01:18:34,211
You are double-faced

1026
01:18:34,628 --> 01:18:36,469
You spend so much time
on these useless things

1027
01:18:36,922 --> 01:18:39,132
You will be a loser

1028
01:18:39,257 --> 01:18:40,008
No

1029
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:41,551
Don't tear up my drawings

1030
01:18:44,054 --> 01:18:47,057
Heaven's Wings

1031
01:18:58,443 --> 01:18:59,527
OK

1032
01:19:00,487 --> 01:19:01,863
I am a loser

1033
01:19:07,661 --> 01:19:09,329
I am not good enough to be your son

1034
01:19:24,386 --> 01:19:25,720
Today

1035
01:19:26,638 --> 01:19:28,181
you proved yourself

1036
01:19:30,016 --> 01:19:31,559
You are far better than me

1037
01:19:35,981 --> 01:19:36,940
Zai Yang

1038
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:46,866
Dad

1039
01:19:48,702 --> 01:19:49,953
Dad

1040
01:20:12,726 --> 01:20:13,893
Wanted

1041
01:20:51,222 --> 01:20:51,765
Boss

1042
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:53,350
Someone is looking for Master Li

1043
01:20:55,727 --> 01:20:56,770
Ask him to leave here

1044
01:20:57,062 --> 01:20:58,772
Tell him that Master Li has moved

1045
01:20:59,814 --> 01:21:00,940
They brought this

1046
01:21:10,116 --> 01:21:12,116
There are too many people
who want to see Master Li

1047
01:21:12,369 --> 01:21:14,788
Our master won't see them

1048
01:21:15,205 --> 01:21:16,289
But our master said that

1049
01:21:16,915 --> 01:21:19,250
anyone who brings our family's Ba Gua Plate

1050
01:21:19,709 --> 01:21:20,627
should be

1051
01:21:20,877 --> 01:21:22,754
welcomed warmly

1052
01:21:27,175 --> 01:21:28,575
I look forward to your instructions

1053
01:22:05,964 --> 01:22:07,048
Excuse my behavior

1054
01:22:07,966 --> 01:22:09,384
Can I see Master Li now?

1055
01:22:10,385 --> 01:22:12,053
I only cover Dui (Lake)

1056
01:22:12,303 --> 01:22:13,583
which is the 1st stage of Ba Gua

1057
01:22:15,306 --> 01:22:16,307
Then

1058
01:22:16,683 --> 01:22:18,560
you still have <i>7</i> stages to go

1059
01:22:23,606 --> 01:22:25,817
Yang Lu Chan Gen (Mountain)

1060
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:38,746
Yang Lu Chan Li (Fire)

1061
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,971
Yang Lu Chan Xun (Wind)

1062
01:23:01,019 --> 01:23:03,938
Yang Lu Chan Zhen (Thunder)

1063
01:23:13,072 --> 01:23:16,034
Yang Lu Chan Kan (Water)

1064
01:23:29,923 --> 01:23:31,090
Which stage is he in now?

1065
01:23:31,382 --> 01:23:32,091
Kan (Water)

1066
01:23:32,592 --> 01:23:33,927
Both Sister Sun who covers Kun (Earth)

1067
01:23:34,052 --> 01:23:35,053
and Brother Le who covers Zhen (Thunder)

1068
01:23:35,178 --> 01:23:35,845
were defeated

1069
01:23:36,054 --> 01:23:36,679
The only one left is

1070
01:23:36,804 --> 01:23:38,348
Brother Liu who covers Qian (Sky)

1071
01:23:38,932 --> 01:23:39,849
Nobody was injured?

1072
01:23:40,308 --> 01:23:40,975
Right

1073
01:23:41,267 --> 01:23:42,477
His kung fu must be excellent

1074
01:23:42,644 --> 01:23:43,978
But he tried not to injure anyone

1075
01:23:44,145 --> 01:23:46,064
Seems like he has other intents

1076
01:23:46,356 --> 01:23:47,756
According to the Prince's wishes...

1077
01:23:50,026 --> 01:23:50,610
Understood

1078
01:23:51,194 --> 01:23:53,154
Just follow Prince's order

1079
01:23:53,321 --> 01:23:53,988
Yes

1080
01:23:57,992 --> 01:23:59,869
Yang Lu Chan Qian (Sky)

1081
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:06,042
lam just lucky

1082
01:24:06,292 --> 01:24:07,252
Brother Liu I must trouble you to...

1083
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:08,294
Never mind

1084
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:09,337
Please

1085
01:24:09,546 --> 01:24:11,256
Our master has been waiting for you

1086
01:24:18,972 --> 01:24:21,224
Chen-style kung fu is brilliant

1087
01:24:21,474 --> 01:24:22,433
Twenty years ago

1088
01:24:22,684 --> 01:24:24,060
I went to the Chen Village

1089
01:24:24,686 --> 01:24:26,479
to fight with Master Chen

1090
01:24:27,105 --> 01:24:28,466
I was defeated nine times in a row

1091
01:24:28,606 --> 01:24:29,816
Finally I improved my kung fu a little bit

1092
01:24:30,066 --> 01:24:30,586
Before I left

1093
01:24:30,692 --> 01:24:32,360
I gave him a Ba Gua Plate

1094
01:24:32,735 --> 01:24:33,570
Should he need help

1095
01:24:33,736 --> 01:24:35,738
I will definitely try my best

1096
01:24:36,114 --> 01:24:37,907
But it's about railway construction

1097
01:24:38,241 --> 01:24:40,243
corruption and rebellion

1098
01:24:40,577 --> 01:24:42,412
I'm in no position to get involved

1099
01:24:49,877 --> 01:24:50,420
Master Li

1100
01:24:50,587 --> 01:24:51,337
You hypocrite!

1101
01:24:51,504 --> 01:24:52,755
You promised to try your best

1102
01:24:59,053 --> 01:25:00,333
Master Li does have difficulties

1103
01:25:00,888 --> 01:25:02,928
But hundreds of lives in our village
are in jeopardy

1104
01:25:03,057 --> 01:25:04,618
The Grandmaster's life is also at stake

1105
01:25:04,976 --> 01:25:06,853
Master Li please help us

1106
01:25:15,778 --> 01:25:16,696
Master Li

1107
01:25:30,376 --> 01:25:31,977
Chen-style kung fu has very strict rules

1108
01:25:32,045 --> 01:25:33,254
to take apprentices

1109
01:25:33,463 --> 01:25:34,964
The top criteria is their
ethics and character

1110
01:25:35,089 --> 01:25:37,550
If they are really from the Chen family

1111
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,135
they must be reliable

1112
01:25:39,302 --> 01:25:41,179
Prince please investigate the case

1113
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:49,812
Stand up

1114
01:25:54,025 --> 01:25:55,526
You are my butler

1115
01:25:55,735 --> 01:25:58,655
and you dare neglect your job

1116
01:25:59,739 --> 01:26:01,783
to allow these two strangers
to enter my house

1117
01:26:02,367 --> 01:26:05,036
As stated by you just now

1118
01:26:05,286 --> 01:26:08,122
deputy governor Fang Zi Jing
was involved in corruption

1119
01:26:08,456 --> 01:26:10,041
and bribery

1120
01:26:10,458 --> 01:26:11,959
He hindered railway construction

1121
01:26:12,877 --> 01:26:14,212
In this case the number of people
who should be executed

1122
01:26:14,462 --> 01:26:16,005
may be more than ten

1123
01:26:16,255 --> 01:26:18,007
Even hundreds

1124
01:26:18,758 --> 01:26:19,342
I can't

1125
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:22,053
purely rely on your words

1126
01:26:22,804 --> 01:26:23,888
In addition

1127
01:26:24,263 --> 01:26:25,848
how do you prove that you are

1128
01:26:26,099 --> 01:26:27,600
from the Chen family?

1129
01:26:28,101 --> 01:26:28,768
I am not lying

1130
01:26:29,519 --> 01:26:30,561
My dad is Chen Chang Xing

1131
01:26:30,978 --> 01:26:32,271
We brought the evidence

1132
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:34,774
Evidence can be fudged

1133
01:26:35,441 --> 01:26:36,693
Your words are no guarantee

1134
01:26:39,278 --> 01:26:40,697
The Prince's meaning is clear

1135
01:26:40,905 --> 01:26:42,532
We have to show him our kung fu skills

1136
01:26:42,782 --> 01:26:43,866
Whether or not we are from the Chen family

1137
01:26:44,075 --> 01:26:45,275
can then be judged very easily

1138
01:26:54,585 --> 01:26:56,504
Everyone thinks Chen-style
kung fu is brilliant

1139
01:26:56,921 --> 01:26:57,630
Master Li

1140
01:26:58,047 --> 01:26:59,632
Please fight with them

1141
01:27:00,258 --> 01:27:01,050
If you can defeat Master Li

1142
01:27:01,259 --> 01:27:02,860
then you are really from the Chen family

1143
01:27:03,302 --> 01:27:05,304
I will investigate the case for you

1144
01:27:06,431 --> 01:27:08,307
But if you lose

1145
01:27:09,267 --> 01:27:11,068
you will be punished as
violators to my house

1146
01:27:20,278 --> 01:27:21,518
How can we fight in this place?

1147
01:27:21,863 --> 01:27:22,697
Follow me

1148
01:27:26,242 --> 01:27:27,034
Don't worry

1149
01:27:29,162 --> 01:27:30,496
Everyone stay focus and

1150
01:27:30,747 --> 01:27:32,123
do your job

1151
01:27:32,290 --> 01:27:33,690
You have to take charge of his meal

1152
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:34,667
Yes

1153
01:27:52,935 --> 01:27:54,854
Yang Lu Chan Vs Head of Ba Gua
- Li Qian Kun

1154
01:28:25,176 --> 01:28:26,427
Have you never seen a fight?

1155
01:28:27,011 --> 01:28:28,346
Focus on your job

1156
01:28:30,097 --> 01:28:31,724
Prepare the meal for the Prince

1157
01:28:32,099 --> 01:28:32,599
Yes

1158
01:28:33,017 --> 01:28:34,393
Let's get started

1159
01:29:27,238 --> 01:29:27,905
Master Li

1160
01:29:28,072 --> 01:29:28,990
Great move

1161
01:30:47,818 --> 01:30:48,653
Stay focused

1162
01:32:35,301 --> 01:32:37,303
Serve the dishes

1163
01:32:37,678 --> 01:32:39,930
First set

1164
01:32:40,681 --> 01:32:43,017
Second set

1165
01:32:43,517 --> 01:32:46,312
Great food brings luck and happiness

1166
01:32:46,562 --> 01:32:49,815
It also brings longevity and cures ailments

1167
01:32:50,274 --> 01:32:51,692
First serve the eight entrées

1168
01:32:51,817 --> 01:32:53,903
six desserts and three soups

1169
01:32:54,236 --> 01:32:55,154
Then serve

1170
01:32:55,279 --> 01:32:58,699
Steamed pork and stewed duck with rice

1171
01:32:58,908 --> 01:33:01,619
Sautéed vegetables and assorted sausages

1172
01:33:01,786 --> 01:33:04,497
Stewed snakes with pigeon
egg and braised duck

1173
01:33:04,914 --> 01:33:08,209
Deep-fried rabbit and simmered deer tail

1174
01:33:08,542 --> 01:33:11,045
Minced chicken with tofu
and steamed crab with beef

1175
01:33:11,212 --> 01:33:14,298
Honey glazed Chinese yams
and sugared water chestnuts

1176
01:33:14,924 --> 01:33:18,719
Longevity dish and roasted clams with tea

1177
01:33:18,886 --> 01:33:20,638
That's all

1178
01:33:21,889 --> 01:33:23,057
Prince your meal is ready

1179
01:33:26,018 --> 01:33:26,727
Are you done?

1180
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:28,896
Chen-style kung fu

1181
01:33:29,146 --> 01:33:30,272
links Yin with Yang

1182
01:33:33,150 --> 01:33:34,471
and integrates truth with fiction

1183
01:33:41,492 --> 01:33:42,910
It is not just kung fu

1184
01:33:47,206 --> 01:33:49,583
It is also a philosophy

1185
01:33:51,127 --> 01:33:53,170
So who wins?

1186
01:33:56,215 --> 01:33:57,675
Mr. Yang's attainments

1187
01:33:57,967 --> 01:33:59,967
are much more important
than the result of the game

1188
01:34:03,347 --> 01:34:04,515
So

1189
01:34:04,682 --> 01:34:05,962
what's the name of your kung fu?

1190
01:34:07,476 --> 01:34:09,145
This is our family's kung fu

1191
01:34:09,353 --> 01:34:10,714
We just call it Chen-style kung fu

1192
01:34:11,772 --> 01:34:12,898
Chen-style kung fu

1193
01:34:15,609 --> 01:34:17,027
links Yin with Yang

1194
01:34:17,278 --> 01:34:18,654
and integrates everything

1195
01:34:19,405 --> 01:34:21,285
It reflects the essence
and philosophy of TAICHI

1196
01:34:22,241 --> 01:34:23,117
In my opinion

1197
01:34:23,659 --> 01:34:25,035
just call it TAICHI

1198
01:34:26,453 --> 01:34:28,372
Thank you for naming it Prince

1199
01:34:33,711 --> 01:34:37,047
So this is why it is called TAICHI

1200
01:34:37,423 --> 01:34:38,174
Now you understand

1201
01:34:38,299 --> 01:34:40,551
why we go through this story

1202
01:34:41,427 --> 01:34:44,722
Lu Chan changed completely after this event

1203
01:34:44,889 --> 01:34:46,098
He was no longer foolish

1204
01:34:46,223 --> 01:34:48,642
He integrated his energy and body and mind

1205
01:34:48,893 --> 01:34:52,021
He would become an unrivaled kung fu master

1206
01:34:52,313 --> 01:34:54,648
However this is a later story

1207
01:34:55,608 --> 01:34:57,484
After the Prince investigated the case

1208
01:34:57,776 --> 01:35:01,322
both Chen Chang Xing
and Chen Zai Yang were released

1209
01:35:01,822 --> 01:35:03,574
They went back to the Chen Village

1210
01:35:06,202 --> 01:35:07,161
Dad

1211
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:14,168
Dad

1212
01:35:29,558 --> 01:35:30,476
Dad

1213
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:32,811
Look

1214
01:35:42,071 --> 01:35:45,157
The rail road took another route

1215
01:35:58,629 --> 01:35:59,129
The End

1216
01:36:12,017 --> 01:36:14,478
Bear with me a little longer

1217
01:36:16,272 --> 01:36:18,107
We're almost there

1218
01:36:23,612 --> 01:36:27,950
After the incident in the Chen Village,
Fleming was fired by the East India Company

1219
01:36:28,075 --> 01:36:29,910
But he didn't return to the UK

1220
01:36:30,119 --> 01:36:34,623
He set up a mysterious organization in Tianjin
to study the extremes of the human body

1220
01:36:35,305 --> 01:37:35,282

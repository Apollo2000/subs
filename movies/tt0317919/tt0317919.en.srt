1
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,616
<i>We've put an explosive
charge in your head.</i>

2
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,123
Does that sound familiar?

3
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:46,004
The Rabbit's Foot. Where is it?

4
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,757
I gave it to you.

5
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,885
Ethan, where's the
Rabbit's Foot?

6
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:55,764
Wait... What are you saying?
That wasn't it?

7
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:59,518
- What I gave you, was that...
- I'm going to count to 10.

8
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:03,689
You're going to tell me where the
Rabbit's Foot is or she dies.

9
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,116
Jules, it's going to be okay.

10
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:17,870
It's going to be okay.
Do you understand?

11
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,163
One.

12
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,542
You listen to me. I got
exactly what you asked for.

13
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,919
Did you want something else?

14
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,172
If there was a misunderstanding,
I will fix it.

15
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:30,174
I can get it, whatever you want.

16
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,466
Two.

17
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:35,012
Listen. Talk to me. We can talk,

18
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,889
like gentlemen.

19
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,851
- Three.
- God!

20
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,654
All right. All right, all right.

21
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:56,700
I know where the
Rabbit's Foot is.

22
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,994
I can help you.

23
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,788
The way you helped
me on the aeroplane?

24
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,582
That way?

25
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,585
You put the gun down. I'm not
talking to you like this.

26
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,129
That's your choice. Four.

27
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,090
The Rabbit's Foot's in Paris.

28
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,927
You want to know where in Paris?
Then let her go.

29
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:18,138
- 'Cause you will not...
- It's not in Paris. Five.

30
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,683
I can get it for you.

31
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,685
But you kill her, you do
this, you get nothing.

32
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,021
- Six.
- Are you listening to me?

33
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,440
The only way you're going to get
what you want is for you to...

34
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,485
- Do you think I'm playing?
- Son of a bitch!

35
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,904
Do you think I'm playing?
You don't think I'll do it?

36
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,864
Where is it? Where
the hell is it?

37
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,407
- Look at me.
- Where the hell is it?

38
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:39,952
- Stay with me.
- Seven! Seven!

39
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:44,581
I am going to kill you. I swear
to God I'm going to kill you!

40
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,750
- Eight!
- No, please.

41
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,592
Please. Don't do this.
Just let her go.

42
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:00,514
I promise you. I promise you.

43
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,100
- I can figure out how to get whatever...
- Nine.

44
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,603
Listen to me. Listen to me.

45
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,065
I want to help you.

46
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,901
I want to help you get
whatever you want.

47
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,697
But you got to do what's right.
What you know is right.

48
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,581
No. No.

49
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,377
No.

50
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,920
- Ten.
- Don't!

51
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,127
- What are you doing?
- Your brother wants another one.

52
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,879
Oh, God, no. Ethan, that's
what we talked about...

53
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,964
- I'm watching him. He's fine.
- That's how it is with Rick.

54
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,634
He's fine and then suddenly he's
naked and he's hugging everybody.

55
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,595
- I'll take full responsibility for Rick.
- You will? Full?

56
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,181
- Well, mostly full.
- It's a huge responsibility.

57
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,849
It's going well, right?

58
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,268
- It's going really well.
- Yeah.

59
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,896
Julia, your sister's here.

60
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,024
- Give me a hug.
- You look so beautiful.

61
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,193
I don't know about that.
So, is this him?

62
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,946
- I hope so.
- Oh, come here. Oh, gosh.

63
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,615
All right. Mom's
dying to see you.

64
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,742
I can't believe you guys came
all the way to Virginia.

65
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,077
Like we'd miss
your engagement...

66
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:49,039
When Julia called and told me
that she was getting married,

67
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:52,125
I had one thought, that
it was just too bad

68
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,505
that Daddy wasn't here to
walk her down the aisle.

69
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,842
And then when Julia told me...
Thanks, Mom.

70
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,386
That Ethan doesn't have his
parents anymore, either,

71
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,304
I got really sad.

72
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:08,600
But it occurred to me that this
is about starting a new family

73
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,644
and how beautiful that is.

74
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,897
And I just want to say I
am making Julia an aunt,

75
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,817
so I expect the same
treatment very, very soon.

76
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,193
Cheers!

77
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,200
Department of Transportation?

78
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,494
I've been there over 10 years now.
Wow.

79
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,162
What do you do at the DOT?

80
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,789
I study traffic patterns.

81
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,208
You hit the brakes for a second,
just tap them on the freeway,

82
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,169
you can literally track the
ripple effect of that action

83
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,795
across a 200-mile
stretch of road,

84
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,213
because traffic has a memory.

85
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,299
It's amazing. It's like
a living organism.

86
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,092
Freshen that up for you?
What is it, vodka martini?

87
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,302
Yeah. Thanks.

88
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,345
Ladies, do you need...

89
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,392
- I'd marry him.
- I would, too.

90
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,353
Okay, so, a three-week
heli-boarding honeymoon?

91
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,356
- Okay, you actually get dropped...
- From a helicopter, yeah.

92
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,442
- It's how they met.
- Really?

93
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,402
- Tell her the story.
- There's no story.

94
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,112
It is a good story.
Tell the story.

95
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:05,282
First of all, no one was
ever good enough for Julia.

96
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,617
Oh, here we go.

97
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:10,662
Not spontaneous enough, adventurous
enough, funny enough...

98
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,540
You know what? No, that's not true. You
make it sound like I've never dated.

99
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:14,666
No one we liked.

100
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,335
- That is true.
- That is true.

101
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:33,977
Then she goes and gets in a chopper
that takes off from this lake...

102
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,897
- What was the name of that lake?
- Lake...

103
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,359
Lake Wanaka. Wanaka.

104
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,861
Wanaka. Thank you.

105
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,697
- He heard that?
- How did he hear that?

106
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,783
And the hospital's cool with
you taking three weeks?

107
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,118
Yeah, I'm not the only nurse
employed there, you know.

108
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:18,856
I'm psyched that you're going
to be my brother, man.

109
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:19,982
So am I, Rick.

110
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,942
No, it's awesome. I think
it's going to be sick.

111
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,444
Me, too, man. I just
got to get the phone.

112
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,405
- You rock hard.
- Okay.

113
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,532
Hello?

114
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,742
<i>- Is this Mr Ethan Hunt?</i>
- Yes, it is.

115
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:33,328
<i>This is Ready-Travel
Resort Services.</i>

116
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:38,083
<i>We'd like to offer you a chance to win
an all-expense-paid trip to Mexico.</i>

117
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,770
We ran out of ice. I'll
be back in 10 minutes.

118
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:01,148
- Oh, no. Can't somebody else go?
- No, I got it.

119
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,192
I'll be right back. Hi, Betsy.

120
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,651
Thank you.

121
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,754
$1.86.

122
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:37,142
Thanks for coming. Can't decide
what size Slurpee to get.

123
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,229
I usually go for the 900-ouncer.

124
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,608
How's that party? Sorry
I had to call you.

125
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,693
- Yeah, you should have come.
- You should have invited me.

126
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,196
- You know I would have.
- Thanks.

127
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,785
I know we joke about it, but I am
always this close to begging you

128
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,246
to stop training our people and
get your ass back in the field.

129
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:00,207
But that's not what you do anymore,
and so I respect that choice.

130
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:04,461
You know I do.
Family's everything.

131
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,049
Come on, John. What's going on?

132
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,721
It's Agent Farris.

133
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,349
She was on an operation.

134
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,478
She's disappeared. Been
off-grid 11 hours.

135
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:27,109
I'm sending in Search and Rescue.
I was hoping you'd want in.

136
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,283
You've got good people for that.

137
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,913
Yeah. Yep, that we do.

138
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,917
Wheels up at sunrise if you
have a change of heart.

139
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,254
Take some pictures
of the party for me.

140
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,692
<i>Ethan. Three days ago,</i>

141
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:12,279
<i>Agent Lindsey Farris was captured
while on a surveillance operation.</i>

142
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,115
<i>This is the man she was tracking.
His name is Owen Davian.</i>

143
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,533
<i>Details are eyes-only,</i>

144
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,411
<i>but I can tell you that Davian's
a black-market trafficker.</i>

145
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:22,414
<i>Extremely dangerous and
a priority for us.</i>

146
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,500
<i>At 1400 hours today,</i>

147
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,752
<i>a recon satellite ID'd
a caravan of vehicles</i>

148
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:30,464
<i>with plates matching those known to
have been used by Davian's operatives.</i>

149
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:33,133
<i>They stopped at a derelict
factory outside Berlin.</i>

150
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:36,512
<i>It appears they have a hostage.
We believe it's Agent Farris.</i>

151
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,722
<i>Normally we would disavow,</i>

152
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,891
<i>but Lindsey may be the key to
getting us closer to Davian,</i>

153
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,684
<i>and that's a risk
we need to take.</i>

154
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,521
<i>Your mission, should you
choose to accept it,</i>

155
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,106
<i>is to find Lindsey
and bring her home.</i>

156
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,901
<i>I've already assembled a team.</i>

157
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,529
<i>I have them standing by,
awaiting your word.</i>

158
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:58,575
<i>This message, let's call it my
excellent engagement gift to you,</i>

159
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,786
<i>will self-destruct
in five seconds.</i>

160
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:03,497
<i>Good luck, Ethan,
and thanks again.</i>

161
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,597
<i>Am I ready?</i>

162
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,487
- You okay?
- Yeah.

163
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,615
Yeah.

164
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:56,216
You know, I'm sorry. I realised I
didn't tell you that the office called

165
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,511
during the party. I have to
go to Houston for a night.

166
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:03,515
METRO's having a public
transpo conference.

167
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:10,105
- It's so last-minute.
- I know.

168
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,467
Well, well, well.

169
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:42,221
Now, if it isn't Mr "Those
Who Can't Do, Teach"

170
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:43,847
back in the field.

171
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,141
- What's up, baby?
- Hey, man.

172
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:50,521
Hey, Ethan, don't worry.
We're going to get the girl.

173
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:54,816
Or have you been away so long
you've forgotten how good we are?

174
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,736
Welcome back, brother.

175
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,554
Is our truck in place?

176
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:24,763
Weapons good to go?

177
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,598
- Yeah. You?
- Yeah.

178
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,684
You know I got your six.

179
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:31,228
Hey, man. That's your job.

180
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,627
<i>Guns one, activated.
Guns two, activated.</i>

181
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,755
<i>Guns three, activated.
Guns four, activated.</i>

182
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,216
<i>Guns ready.</i>

183
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,099
All four guns operational.

184
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:12,895
They've got men on the second,
third, fourth floors.

185
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:15,397
<i>I count 14 of them.</i>

186
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,442
Observer, I'm in
approach position.

187
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:20,611
Roger that. Stand by.

188
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:26,992
<i>Target match.</i>

189
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,995
The prize is on the sixth floor.
Two Tangos with her.

190
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,705
Moving in.

191
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,349
<i>So, Raider One, at some point,</i>

192
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:52,643
we got to go over this whole
"getting married" thing.

193
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,770
Negative, Observer.

194
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:57,689
I don't respect you nearly enough
to have that conversation.

195
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:58,941
<i>You may not respect me,</i>

196
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,193
<i>but for now you're stuck
with my voice in your head.</i>

197
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:03,904
So, this girl, what the hell
do you see in her anyway?

198
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:07,491
Who, Julia? You've
never met her.

199
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:10,118
Yeah, and the way things
are, I probably never will.

200
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,664
<i>Lucky for her, right? That's
what you're thinking.</i>

201
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,582
They've got communications gear.

202
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:18,669
Two Tangos, second floor,
northwest corridor.

203
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,462
Groundhog, that's you.

204
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,214
<i>You need to grab that
gear on the second floor</i>

205
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:23,674
<i>as soon as we go hot.</i>

206
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:26,301
Copy that. I'll
need two minutes,

207
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,136
which means you'll
need me in one, right?

208
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,847
Yeah, just about.

209
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:32,266
Raider One, make a left
at the top of the stairs.

210
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:35,310
<i>The prize should be at
the end of the hall.</i>

211
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:55,956
Phoenix, I have
eye on the prize.

212
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:58,000
Give her 10 cc's more.

213
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,424
- Call me when she wakes.
- Okay.

214
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:08,135
We need touchdown in less than three.
Do you copy?

215
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,386
<i>Roger that, I copy.</i>

216
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,848
Please, when do I not copy?
All I do is copy.

217
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:19,563
Stand by to go live. On my mark.

218
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,773
<i>Three.</i>

219
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:22,941
<i>Two.</i>

220
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,776
One. Execute.

221
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:35,704
<i>Warning. Warning.</i>

222
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,060
Raider One, you're clear. Move!

223
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:08,195
Lindsey. Lindsey.

224
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:11,156
Ethan?

225
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,785
I'm going to get you home.

226
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:21,583
Observer, I've got the prize.
Evac in three.

227
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,126
<i>Roger that.</i>

228
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:32,803
This is adrenaline. Lindsey,
you're going to feel this.

229
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,822
<i>Groundhog, second
floor is clear.</i>

230
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:53,407
On the move!

231
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:18,348
Observer, we're on the move.
Wrap out.

232
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,642
- Evac in 90 seconds.
<i>- Roger that.</i>

233
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,519
Phoenix, get to the LZ now.

234
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,813
Roger, Observer. On my way.

235
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,665
Ethan. I have to talk to you.

236
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,667
- Come on, come on.
- I have to talk to you right now!

237
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,879
Just for you. Turn off
your transmitter.

238
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,548
Do it, Ethan!

239
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,227
Ethan!

240
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:14,571
- Lindsey! Moving!
- Moving!

241
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:27,918
Mag!

242
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:30,879
Ready to move.

243
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:56,738
We evac from here.

244
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:58,323
Get down!

245
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:07,207
I'm out. How many
rounds you got?

246
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:10,878
Enough.

247
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:23,182
Now I'm out.

248
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,978
T minus five, baby.

249
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:42,576
Lindsey, hold on to me.

250
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,224
Luther!

251
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:07,309
Rolling!

252
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:36,380
God! My head! What is that?

253
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:38,215
- What is...
- Is she okay?

254
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,467
Lindsey! Let's get
to the chopper.

255
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:42,094
Zhen, get rid of the truck.

256
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,554
Let's go!

257
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:52,938
God! What is that?
You can't hear that?

258
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,816
- Oh! God!
- What's wrong with her?

259
00:21:57,401 --> 00:21:58,652
- Let's go!
- We loaded?

260
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:01,029
Yeah. Let's do it! Move out!

261
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:08,370
Go, go, go, go, go!

262
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:31,894
- Son of a bitch.
- No!

263
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:35,355
Guys, we got company. I'm
going to try and lose them.

264
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,982
Hurts so much.

265
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:40,444
Turn it off. Please.

266
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:58,879
Please, Ethan.

267
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:12,184
Guys, their missiles are hot!

268
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:18,690
Incoming! Hold on.

269
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:32,454
Okay. That was lucky. We
only get one of those.

270
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:44,174
Do we have a defibrillator?

271
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:48,095
Ethan, turn it off!

272
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,055
Bring it on!

273
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:55,352
Ethan! What is it? Did they
put something in my head?

274
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:57,396
They injected you with
a time-release charge.

275
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:59,022
- Do you remember that?
- No. Time-release...

276
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:00,482
An explosive. They've
activated it.

277
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:01,984
It's gonna detonate
unless we fry the charge,

278
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,277
- which is what we're gonna do.
- No, Ethan.

279
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:04,736
Zap her like that,
you'll stop her heart.

280
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:07,406
Then I'll zap her again
and bring her back.

281
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:08,615
Do it!

282
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,826
Guys! They're
firing another one!

283
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,252
- Ethan!
- Zhen!

284
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:22,838
Zhen, hold on. Hold on, hold on!

285
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:47,529
- I want you to set it for 150.
- 150.

286
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,364
Lindsey, I'm gonna short out
the explosive in your head.

287
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:51,450
- You're gonna be okay.
- It'll need 30 seconds.

288
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:54,036
Damn it.

289
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:56,330
- Twenty-five seconds!
- Come on.

290
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:58,248
We're almost there.

291
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:03,837
- They have us locked.
- Twenty seconds.

292
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:06,757
Hold on.

293
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:25,108
I got them!

294
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:26,818
- Ten seconds.
- Almost there. Almost there.

295
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:29,363
Give me the paddles.

296
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:31,949
Ethan. Thank you.

297
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:08,235
Shit.

298
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:46,481
Hey.

299
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:49,359
Hey.

300
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:58,494
How did it go?

301
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm sorry. Fine. I'm sorry.

302
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:07,211
I'm just tired.

303
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:38,826
I read your training
brief on Agent Farris.

304
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:41,370
The words you used
were "beyond capable."

305
00:27:41,495 --> 00:27:42,830
That still stand, Mr Hunt?

306
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:45,290
- Mr Brassel...
- Does it stand?

307
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,251
Yes, sir, it does.

308
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:50,587
Because we've got a corpse
downstairs that says otherwise.

309
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,381
Killed by a detonator

310
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:55,717
implanted in her skull
through the nasal cavity.

311
00:27:56,885 --> 00:28:00,013
Mr Brassel, it's unacceptable to judge
Agent Farris' competence based...

312
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:02,224
It's unacceptable that
chocolate makes you fat,

313
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:04,351
but I've eaten my share.
And guess what?

314
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:06,812
Now, I approved Agent
Farris' surveillance op

315
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:09,064
based on your
evaluations, Mr Hunt,

316
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:11,567
of a woman who allowed
herself to be captured.

317
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:14,653
So you go to recover her.
You encounter a dozen men.

318
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:16,405
You don't grab any of them?

319
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:20,159
Our objective, Mr Brassel,
was to recover Agent Farris.

320
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:23,245
Davian employs a cellular
structure at his organisation.

321
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,414
The men there more than
likely had no information...

322
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:28,542
Who's drawing these conclusions?
Is it you?

323
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:31,795
- I am, sir. Based upon...
- I'm not on you yet.

324
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:35,007
You allowed Farris to board
your chopper without a scan.

325
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:37,176
That explosive device could
have taken you all out.

326
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:41,763
There is one reason that you are sitting
here before me today, and that is luck.

327
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:46,143
Because your operation was poorly
conceived and executed worse.

328
00:28:46,268 --> 00:28:48,562
- Two laptops were recovered...
- I'm aware of that.

329
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:50,022
We've talked to Tech Services.

330
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:52,482
They doubt if they can
reconstitute the drives.

331
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,861
"Crispy," I believe, is what
they called them. Worthless.

332
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:58,238
Mr Brassel, as Operation
Manager of this office,

333
00:28:58,363 --> 00:28:59,781
- I have the authority...
- Excuse me.

334
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:02,951
Did you just throw a title
at me, Mr Musgrave?

335
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:06,413
I don't care if your daddy
plays golf with the President.

336
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:09,625
This is Intelligence. So
far I haven't seen any.

337
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,878
You think this op was
worth the risk, Mr Hunt.

338
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:16,423
What do you know
about Owen Davian?

339
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:20,010
He was the one who brought
gas centrifuge technology

340
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:22,179
to Korea from Pakistan.

341
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:26,475
He was also the man who sold Toxin
Five to the Armahad Republic Jihad.

342
00:29:26,892 --> 00:29:31,146
He is a man who provides,
provides, provides!

343
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:36,151
And he remains invisible.
He's a goddamn invisible man.

344
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:39,196
Wells, not Ellison, in case
you want to be cute again.

345
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:41,073
We can't find him.

346
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:45,661
He knows it. It's
emboldened him.

347
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:49,540
I've been trying to bring Davian
down since the day that I got here.

348
00:29:49,665 --> 00:29:50,833
Do you know what
I've got for it?

349
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:53,168
It's never been confirmed the
Toxin Five theft was Davian.

350
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:57,297
Mr Musgrave, please don't interrupt me
when I'm asking rhetorical questions.

351
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:59,508
Your operation has
achieved one thing.

352
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:02,845
You have reminded Davian
that he is winning.

353
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:07,307
And now, if you'll excuse me, I
have to go inform Mr and Mrs Farris

354
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:11,311
that their baby girl was killed
in a head-on collision on I-95.

355
00:30:13,397 --> 00:30:15,899
<i>I stand here today
deeply saddened</i>

356
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:18,986
by the death of one
of God's children,

357
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:21,822
Lindsey Elizabeth Farris.

358
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:27,369
It is always startling when the Lord
takes one of our young so unexpectedly.

359
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:33,542
<i>Be aggressive. Come on. Stay focused.
Keep your knees bent. Good. Good.</i>

360
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,711
<i>Now, to fire the lock, the
extractor has to be...</i>

361
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:37,754
<i>That bag's not going to hit you back.
Hit harder.</i>

362
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,257
<i>Don't rely on your sights. Keep
your eyes dead on the target...</i>

363
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:41,967
<i>Attack me. Come on.</i>

364
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:45,179
<i>Don't ever release the firing
pin unless the extractor's...</i>

365
00:30:45,304 --> 00:30:47,389
<i>Good. There you go. Good.</i>

366
00:30:47,723 --> 00:30:51,977
<i>Identify the target. Point and shoot.
It's very simple. You point and shoot.</i>

367
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:53,145
<i>Stay focused.</i>

368
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:56,273
<i>Miss Farris, you know how
many recruits I've trained.</i>

369
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:58,233
<i>I'm proud to say that
you are the first</i>

370
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:00,986
<i>that I've recommended
for active field duty.</i>

371
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:02,446
<i>Congratulations.</i>

372
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:03,947
<i>Am I ready?</i>

373
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:11,246
Yes?

374
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:13,415
<i>Is this Mr Kelvin?</i>

375
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:17,836
Yes. Who is this?

376
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,255
<i>I'm calling from
Norfolk Mail Service.</i>

377
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,799
<i>Lindsey Farris rents a
post office box here.</i>

378
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:24,510
<i>She sent you a piece
of mail from Berlin</i>

379
00:31:24,635 --> 00:31:26,512
<i>and asked us to call
you when it arrived.</i>

380
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:28,514
<i>It came this morning.</i>

381
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:34,228
Thank you.

382
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:40,108
- This right here.
- Thanks.

383
00:31:57,543 --> 00:31:58,877
<i>It's a microdot.</i>

384
00:31:58,961 --> 00:32:01,213
A microdot with nothing on it.
This is unusual.

385
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:03,340
Lindsey wouldn't send
me a blank microdot.

386
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:05,008
I'm telling you, man,
there's no image.

387
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:06,426
Then you're not looking
in the right place.

388
00:32:06,552 --> 00:32:08,011
Where the hell am I
supposed to look?

389
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:09,555
There's not much square
footage to this thing.

390
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,098
Why would Lindsey send
me a blank microdot?

391
00:32:11,223 --> 00:32:12,975
I don't know. Why would
Lindsey send you anything?

392
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,769
You were her instructor,
not her handler.

393
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:19,481
Listen, man. I don't
mean to cross the line,

394
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:23,527
but was there something
going on between you two?

395
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:25,320
You and Lindsey.

396
00:32:25,863 --> 00:32:28,365
Lindsey was like
my little sister.

397
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:30,409
And you never

398
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:34,246
slept with your
little sister, right?

399
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:40,002
Hey, brother, if I don't
ask you, who will?

400
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:42,629
Maybe it's magnetic.
The microdot.

401
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:45,132
Well, that's old school.

402
00:32:45,257 --> 00:32:48,719
If she was in a hurry and only had
access to black-market gear, maybe.

403
00:32:48,844 --> 00:32:51,054
- Could you get the tools to read it?
- I might know a guy.

404
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,557
- Magnetic means encrypted.
- Yeah, I know that.

405
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:56,351
Yeah. Be right there.

406
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,646
The thing about Lindsey
is she was brand-new.

407
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:02,900
She was sweet. Remember
when you were sweet?

408
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:06,528
- Can you remember that far back?
- Yeah, well, barely.

409
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:10,407
In Germany, you asked me
what it is I see in Julia.

410
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:13,952
What I see in Julia is
life before all this.

411
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:16,413
And it's good.

412
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:20,167
Benji, what have you got?

413
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:22,503
Well, these hard drive
platters are just fried.

414
00:33:22,628 --> 00:33:24,379
- Yeah.
- You know, they made a mess of them.

415
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:25,881
It's just like... There's
holes in them and stuff.

416
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:27,883
And it's got scorched all the way through.
And then...

417
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:29,551
Look, this one's got a
hole in it and stuff.

418
00:33:29,676 --> 00:33:30,928
I can't believe. I
can't even look at it.

419
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:33,222
- Benji. Did you recover anything?
- Yes. Yes.

420
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:36,225
Despite the aforementioned conditions
of the hard drive you brought back,

421
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:40,896
I managed to recover portions
of two dozen e-mail files.

422
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:42,523
Also made what I believe to be

423
00:33:42,648 --> 00:33:45,609
a thoroughly promotion-worthy
breakthrough.

424
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:49,488
Your Mr Davian is going to arrive
in Rome the day after tomorrow

425
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:52,658
and attend a function
at one Vatican City.

426
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:54,910
What the hell is Davian
doing at the Vatican?

427
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:57,037
It's all got to do with
the "Rabbit's Foot."

428
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:58,247
Rabbit's Foot?

429
00:33:58,372 --> 00:34:00,040
Yeah, well, I'm assuming
it's like a code word

430
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:02,292
for something he's about to
sell to an unspecified buyer,

431
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:06,004
for $850 million, by the way.
Or maybe it's not a code word.

432
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:08,799
Maybe it's just a really, really
expensive bunny appendage.

433
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:10,425
You have no idea what it is?

434
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:13,262
It's interesting. I used to have
this professor at Oxford, okay?

435
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:16,473
Dr Wickham, his name was, and he
was like this massive, fat guy.

436
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:18,934
You know, huge, big guy.
We used to call him...

437
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:20,811
You know... Well, I won't tell
you what we used to call him.

438
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:23,647
He taught biomolecular kinetics
and cellular dynamics,

439
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:25,774
and he used to sort of
scare the underclassmen

440
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:29,027
with this story about how the world
would eventually be eviscerated

441
00:34:29,153 --> 00:34:30,487
by technology.

442
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:34,074
You see, it was inevitable that
a compound would be created,

443
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,702
which he referred to
as the "Anti-God."

444
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:39,037
It was like an accelerated
mutator, a sort of, you know,

445
00:34:39,163 --> 00:34:42,249
like an unstoppable force
of destructive power

446
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:44,084
that would just lay
waste to everything.

447
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:46,378
To buildings and parks
and streets and children

448
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:49,006
and ice cream
parlours, you know?

449
00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:51,967
So whenever I see, like,
a rogue organisation,

450
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:55,762
willing to spend this amount
of money on a mystery tech,

451
00:34:56,388 --> 00:34:59,224
I always assume
it's the Anti-God.

452
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:03,604
End-of-the-world kind
of stuff, you know?

453
00:35:05,314 --> 00:35:08,483
But, no, I don't have any idea what it is.
I was just speculating.

454
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,944
- Did you brief Musgrave on this?
- Who, me? No, not yet.

455
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:12,738
- Good. Don't.
- What?

456
00:35:12,863 --> 00:35:14,573
- Don't tell anyone about this.
- This took me ages.

457
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:16,074
If something goes wrong
with the operation,

458
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,619
I want Musgrave to
have deniability.

459
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:21,330
- That's great work, Benji.
- What operation?

460
00:35:22,664 --> 00:35:24,583
That look in your eye
is a pain in my ass.

461
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,585
You know that, right?

462
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:30,589
<i>Any available resident
to Paediatrics.</i>

463
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,009
<i>Any available resident
to Paediatrics.</i>

464
00:35:35,928 --> 00:35:38,680
<i>Rehabilitative Care,
call the pharmacy.</i>

465
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:42,392
<i>Rehabilitative Care, call the...</i>

466
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:45,479
I have to go away again.

467
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:49,942
On business. Two days.

468
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,653
Two days?

469
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:54,905
Yeah.

470
00:36:01,537 --> 00:36:03,497
Ethan, what's going on?

471
00:36:05,165 --> 00:36:07,709
I keep thinking you
just need time

472
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:13,048
to tell me whatever
it is that it's...

473
00:36:17,052 --> 00:36:19,638
But nothing in my
mind makes sense.

474
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:23,517
Yeah.

475
00:36:27,563 --> 00:36:29,064
What's wrong?

476
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,283
What are you not telling me?

477
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:08,228
I need to ask you for something.

478
00:37:08,353 --> 00:37:10,772
And it's the most...

479
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,034
I need you to trust me.

480
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:26,622
Of course I trust you.

481
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:34,671
Am I ever going to be able
to understand what this is?

482
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:40,135
I need you to trust me.

483
00:37:46,308 --> 00:37:47,434
Yes.

484
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,270
I trust you.

485
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,650
Is it...

486
00:37:55,692 --> 00:37:57,444
Tell me it's real.

487
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,326
I mean us.

488
00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:07,621
Tell me it's real.

489
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:11,792
Follow me.

490
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:14,628
<i>The vows you're about to take</i>

491
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:18,340
are not to be taken without
careful thought and prayer.

492
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:23,387
This love is not to be diminished
by difficult circumstances

493
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:26,598
and it is only to be
dissolved by death.

494
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,477
Do you have the rings?

495
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:31,895
Yeah.

496
00:38:46,368 --> 00:38:48,036
Repeat after me.

497
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:57,087
I, Julia Anne Meade...

498
00:38:58,297 --> 00:39:01,383
"I, Julia Anne Meade..."

499
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:04,928
...hereby take Ethan
Matthew Hunt...

500
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:08,640
"...hereby take Ethan
Matthew Hunt..."

501
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:11,435
...to be my lawfully
wedded husband.

502
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:14,521
"...to be my lawfully
wedded husband."

503
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:33,832
Tomorrow may be the only
time we can predict

504
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:35,501
where Owen Davian
is going to be.

505
00:39:35,626 --> 00:39:37,127
Charity event. Vatican City.

506
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:40,255
Our mission is to get
in and kidnap Davian.

507
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,758
I don't know why he's so happy.

508
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:46,345
I did remind him that the
Vatican is the Vatican.

509
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:50,557
A 109-acre sovereign state
in the middle of Rome,

510
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:54,269
surrounded by a 60-foot wall,
which is monitored 24/7,

511
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:56,813
with over 200 CCTV cameras.

512
00:39:58,065 --> 00:40:00,400
That's not even what
makes it a challenge.

513
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:04,738
Getting Davian is good. But getting
his buyers is even better.

514
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:08,909
If they realise he's been
grabbed, they'll disappear.

515
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:11,078
I'm sorry, what are you saying?

516
00:40:11,203 --> 00:40:12,496
No matter how we grab Davian,

517
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:14,414
his clients are gonna
know he's been taken.

518
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,376
No, they won't.
Access point is here.

519
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:20,796
It's a one-way street
adjacent to the Vatican wall.

520
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:24,091
I'll need 30 seconds.
And we'll need a truck.

521
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:02,754
Now we've pissed off
every Italian in Rome,

522
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,922
go do what you got to do.

523
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:06,383
- Don't forget the smoke.
- Yeah.

524
00:41:48,509 --> 00:41:49,801
"Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall."

525
00:43:04,126 --> 00:43:06,795
Alpha team, this is Bravo.
Right on schedule.

526
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:09,715
<i>We should have breach in 60.</i>

527
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,467
Roger that. Charlie
team, report.

528
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:15,095
<i>Well, I don't have anything
to report, really.</i>

529
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:20,350
Except I think I should
be right on time.

530
00:43:20,475 --> 00:43:21,518
We'll be waiting for you.

531
00:43:21,643 --> 00:43:24,354
- ETA two minutes.
<i>- Roger that.</i>

532
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:57,596
Charlie team, did you
fire the tracer yet?

533
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:00,307
Stand by.

534
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,241
Firing the tracer. Now.

535
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,208
Alpha, I'm in. T
minus two minutes.

536
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:27,709
Roger that.

537
00:44:30,504 --> 00:44:31,713
Charlie team, I see you.

538
00:44:32,214 --> 00:44:34,550
<i>I'm looping the security feed.
Stand by to move.</i>

539
00:44:34,675 --> 00:44:36,051
Roger that.

540
00:44:37,803 --> 00:44:39,221
Video is looped. Go.

541
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:55,654
Alpha team, catacomb
video taken care of?

542
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:57,781
Taken care of. We're good to go.

543
00:45:06,248 --> 00:45:09,626
- Delta team, do you copy?
<i>- All I do is copy.</i>

544
00:45:09,918 --> 00:45:13,255
That's funny. Get ready
to move into position.

545
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,799
<i>- I'm already there.</i>
- Really?

546
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:20,012
<i>ETA 30 seconds.</i>

547
00:45:20,137 --> 00:45:21,680
See you in 30.

548
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:32,691
Alpha team moving into position.

549
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:34,568
Bravo standing by
for transmission.

550
00:45:36,653 --> 00:45:37,738
Transmitting.

551
00:45:41,158 --> 00:45:42,409
Got you.

552
00:45:57,174 --> 00:45:58,675
Miss Onia Demea.

553
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,345
I should be on the list.
Thank you.

554
00:46:02,387 --> 00:46:03,722
I'm sorry. Your
name is not here.

555
00:46:03,847 --> 00:46:05,724
There must be some mistake.

556
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:16,068
Miss Demea?

557
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:18,529
Just a minute.

558
00:46:54,398 --> 00:46:55,816
She made it.

559
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:18,797
We have a photo opportunity.

560
00:47:19,298 --> 00:47:21,925
<i>Just give me the word.
I'm standing by.</i>

561
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:23,677
Delta, ready for upload.

562
00:47:40,652 --> 00:47:42,738
Delta team, download good.

563
00:47:53,957 --> 00:47:56,627
Listen, man, I didn't mean to
be so cavalier the other day

564
00:47:56,752 --> 00:47:58,253
about you getting engaged.

565
00:47:58,378 --> 00:48:01,006
I know that. Thanks.

566
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:07,054
But a normal relationship isn't
viable for people like us.

567
00:48:07,179 --> 00:48:09,973
- I don't agree with that.
- Then I'm smarter than you.

568
00:48:10,098 --> 00:48:12,601
I'm going up. I
agree with Luther.

569
00:48:12,726 --> 00:48:16,647
We can't have real relationships.
But you see, I love that.

570
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:43,799
Twenty-three months. That's
as long as it'll last

571
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:46,885
when you got the baggage we
do and the lifestyle we got.

572
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,929
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

573
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:52,808
Look at me. I know what
I'm talking about.

574
00:48:52,933 --> 00:48:55,853
And you know I know
what I'm talking about.

575
00:49:08,073 --> 00:49:09,408
Wait here.

576
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:32,764
Davian just picked
up a briefcase.

577
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:34,600
We're going to have to move
sooner than we thought.

578
00:49:34,725 --> 00:49:38,395
- Can you identify who made the drop?
<i>- Negative. How close are you guys?</i>

579
00:49:38,645 --> 00:49:40,689
We're just printing now.

580
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,252
I'm not proud of it. I'm
not happy about it,

581
00:50:02,377 --> 00:50:04,171
but I've lived with
women a few times,

582
00:50:04,296 --> 00:50:06,381
and it doesn't ever
make it to two years.

583
00:50:06,507 --> 00:50:08,258
- You can't.
- Thanks for the advice,

584
00:50:08,383 --> 00:50:10,886
but it's different for me
than it is for you, you know?

585
00:50:11,011 --> 00:50:12,971
- I'm not in the field anymore.
- Oh, okay.

586
00:50:13,096 --> 00:50:15,307
Here's a retirement present.

587
00:50:18,435 --> 00:50:22,022
In our job, there's always going to
be something between you and a woman.

588
00:50:22,147 --> 00:50:23,315
Always.

589
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,651
- Luther, listen.
- Dishonesty.

590
00:50:25,776 --> 00:50:28,445
A dishonesty that
poisons everything.

591
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:30,197
I think I need to
tell you something...

592
00:50:30,322 --> 00:50:33,200
Stop talking. This isn't
about you, Ethan.

593
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:37,871
And whoever this girl is, you're going
to end up messing up her life, too.

594
00:50:37,996 --> 00:50:39,414
Don't do it.

595
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:43,544
Jules and I got
married two days ago.

596
00:50:45,671 --> 00:50:47,297
Congratulations.

597
00:50:48,298 --> 00:50:50,717
Thanks. Thanks.

598
00:50:55,472 --> 00:50:58,308
- He's walking. I'm going in.
<i>- Roger that.</i>

599
00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:01,019
I'm on my way.

600
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:07,568
Ma'am. I need you to step back.

601
00:51:07,693 --> 00:51:09,570
No. It's fine. It's fine.
It's fine.

602
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:12,072
I always spill red wine on
my white custom-made shirt.

603
00:51:12,197 --> 00:51:15,492
- Okay. Step back.
- It's fine. It's fine. Bathroom.

604
00:51:18,245 --> 00:51:19,663
Tell me you're on your way.

605
00:51:19,788 --> 00:51:21,456
I'm on the move.

606
00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:31,675
Move it. Come on.

607
00:51:35,262 --> 00:51:37,264
His bodyguards are
checking out the bathroom.

608
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:39,641
I'm almost there.

609
00:52:20,474 --> 00:52:21,600
He's going in.

610
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:51,547
Quiet. Read this.

611
00:52:51,713 --> 00:52:52,965
Slowly.

612
00:52:54,925 --> 00:52:56,176
Read it.

613
00:52:58,011 --> 00:53:01,348
"The pleasure of
Buzby's company"

614
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:03,725
"is what I most enjoy."

615
00:53:04,935 --> 00:53:07,646
"He put a tack on
Miss Yancy's chair"

616
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,108
"when she called him
a horrible boy."

617
00:53:11,441 --> 00:53:14,528
<i>"At the end of the month he
was flinging two kittens"</i>

618
00:53:14,653 --> 00:53:16,363
<i>"across the width of the room."</i>

619
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:19,366
"I count on his schemes
to reveal the..."

620
00:53:19,491 --> 00:53:21,827
- What the hell is this?
- Finish.

621
00:53:23,996 --> 00:53:25,664
Alpha, you're about
to have a visitor.

622
00:53:26,123 --> 00:53:27,249
Finish!

623
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:28,959
"...a way to escape my gloom."

624
00:53:29,084 --> 00:53:30,335
Got it.

625
00:53:36,508 --> 00:53:38,468
<i>Alpha, do you copy? The
guard's on his way.</i>

626
00:53:38,594 --> 00:53:40,095
Delta, stall him.
I need more time.

627
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:43,182
<i>It's too late for that.
He's in the hallway.</i>

628
00:53:51,732 --> 00:53:52,816
Sir, is everything all right?

629
00:53:52,941 --> 00:53:55,444
Everything is not all right.
Voice mask is still compiling.

630
00:53:55,569 --> 00:53:57,237
<i>I need 30 seconds.</i>

631
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,284
Sir?

632
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:11,210
Sir?

633
00:54:19,051 --> 00:54:20,260
Six seconds, I'm uploading.

634
00:54:22,721 --> 00:54:23,472
<i>- A way to escape my gloom.</i>
- Okay. Go.

635
00:54:23,473 --> 00:54:25,098
<i>- A way to escape my gloom.</i>
- Okay. Go.

636
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:28,268
I'm fine. Wait outside.

637
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:44,493
See you in the sewer.

638
00:54:52,334 --> 00:54:55,629
- She's sorry about your shirt.
- That's no problem.

639
00:54:58,966 --> 00:55:02,261
Her hotel has laundry service, and
she'll happily take care of it.

640
00:55:02,386 --> 00:55:03,679
You want to wash my shirt?

641
00:55:03,804 --> 00:55:06,306
What are we going to do while
we're waiting in your hotel room,

642
00:55:06,431 --> 00:55:07,724
and I'm not wearing my shirt?

643
00:55:11,937 --> 00:55:13,814
She'll think of something.

644
00:55:14,773 --> 00:55:16,358
She would like to drive.

645
00:55:16,483 --> 00:55:17,985
Follow me to the hotel.

646
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:19,903
Sir, would you like
us to watch the case?

647
00:55:20,028 --> 00:55:21,071
No.

648
00:55:22,447 --> 00:55:24,283
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

649
00:56:02,696 --> 00:56:05,157
- What's up?
- Nothing. What's up with you?

650
00:56:05,282 --> 00:56:06,533
Nothing.

651
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,261
Blow the car.

652
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:30,390
Oh. It's such a nice car.

653
00:56:30,516 --> 00:56:32,726
And yet, do it.

654
00:56:54,873 --> 00:56:57,084
...covered some hot spots
over in central Eurasia.

655
00:56:57,209 --> 00:57:00,170
I direct your attention to the third
satellite image in the series

656
00:57:00,295 --> 00:57:01,880
forwarded to us
by our friends...

657
00:57:02,005 --> 00:57:03,423
<i>Mr Musgrave to see you.</i>

658
00:57:03,549 --> 00:57:04,967
Send him in.

659
00:57:07,094 --> 00:57:10,806
Ethan Hunt and his team just
grabbed Owen Davian in Rome.

660
00:57:10,973 --> 00:57:14,351
They're headed back now. I
thought you should know.

661
00:57:15,018 --> 00:57:17,271
You were aware of
this operation?

662
00:57:19,398 --> 00:57:20,774
Yes, I was.

663
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:23,318
Then good work.

664
00:57:27,072 --> 00:57:28,407
Thank you.

665
00:58:02,691 --> 00:58:04,693
You're dead, Mr Davian.

666
00:58:09,448 --> 00:58:11,283
There were witnesses.

667
00:58:14,661 --> 00:58:16,872
That was you in the bathroom.

668
00:58:16,997 --> 00:58:18,707
Now, you're going to
tell us everything.

669
00:58:18,832 --> 00:58:21,335
Every buyer you've worked with.
Every organisation.

670
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,711
What the hell is your name?

671
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:24,963
Names, contacts,
inventory lists.

672
00:58:25,088 --> 00:58:27,925
You have a wife, girlfriend?

673
00:58:30,344 --> 00:58:32,221
It's up to you how this goes.

674
00:58:32,346 --> 00:58:35,224
Because you know what
I'm going to do next?

675
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:37,684
I'm going to find
her, whoever she is,

676
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:41,063
I'm going to find her, and
I'm going to hurt her.

677
00:58:44,775 --> 00:58:46,693
You were apprehended
carrying details

678
00:58:46,819 --> 00:58:49,822
of the location of something
code named the Rabbit's Foot.

679
00:58:49,947 --> 00:58:53,659
I'm going to make her bleed, and
cry, and call out your name.

680
00:58:53,784 --> 00:58:57,496
And you're not going to be able to do shit.
You know why?

681
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:00,082
What is the Rabbit's Foot?

682
00:59:00,207 --> 00:59:02,459
Because you're going to
be this close to dead.

683
00:59:02,584 --> 00:59:03,710
And who is the buyer?

684
00:59:03,836 --> 00:59:07,339
And then I'm going to kill
you right in front of her.

685
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:10,717
- I'm going to ask you one more time.
- What's your name?

686
00:59:10,843 --> 00:59:12,302
- What is the Rabbit's Foot?
- Who are you?

687
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:13,470
And who is the buyer?

688
00:59:13,595 --> 00:59:15,931
You don't have any idea what
the hell is going on, do you?

689
00:59:16,056 --> 00:59:20,477
I mean, you saw what I did to your little
blonde friend at the factory, right?

690
00:59:23,564 --> 00:59:25,983
Well, that was nothing. That was

691
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:29,236
fun.

692
00:59:33,282 --> 00:59:34,741
That was fun.

693
01:00:05,772 --> 01:00:07,858
What is the Rabbit's Foot?

694
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:17,284
- Ethan!
- What is the Rabbit's Foot?

695
01:00:17,784 --> 01:00:19,161
Ethan, stop!

696
01:00:19,286 --> 01:00:20,704
What is it?

697
01:00:21,955 --> 01:00:23,415
Don't do it!

698
01:00:24,124 --> 01:00:26,627
- Ethan!
- What is the Rabbit's Foot?

699
01:00:28,712 --> 01:00:29,880
You tell me!

700
01:00:30,005 --> 01:00:31,632
Ethan, stop! Don't do it.

701
01:00:31,757 --> 01:00:33,926
This isn't you, man!
This isn't you!

702
01:00:34,092 --> 01:00:36,803
We can use him, Ethan!
You know that!

703
01:00:43,227 --> 01:00:45,187
No, Ethan! Don't do it!

704
01:00:46,939 --> 01:00:48,398
Please, stop!

705
01:01:19,596 --> 01:01:21,265
What I'm selling,

706
01:01:21,974 --> 01:01:23,976
and who I'm selling to,

707
01:01:26,645 --> 01:01:29,857
is the last thing you
should be concerned about,

708
01:01:32,359 --> 01:01:33,569
Ethan.

709
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,088
Ethan, we got it.
Lindsey's microdot.

710
01:02:35,589 --> 01:02:37,341
It's a video file.

711
01:02:41,678 --> 01:02:44,723
<i>Ethan, I don't know what they've told you.
I don't know what you think.</i>

712
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:46,433
<i>Just listen to me.</i>

713
01:02:46,558 --> 01:02:49,061
<i>Brassel sent me to Germany
to surveil an exchange,</i>

714
01:02:49,186 --> 01:02:51,230
<i>to ID a man named Owen Davian.</i>

715
01:02:51,355 --> 01:02:54,066
<i>I tagged his phone, and I
intercepted a transmission.</i>

716
01:02:54,191 --> 01:02:57,528
<i>I traced the call through the IMF
network, and this is what came up.</i>

717
01:02:57,653 --> 01:03:00,739
<i>The call to Davian came
from Brassel's office.</i>

718
01:03:01,615 --> 01:03:04,493
<i>It's Brassel. I think
he's working with Davian.</i>

719
01:03:04,618 --> 01:03:06,578
<i>I think I'm being set up...</i>

720
01:03:20,801 --> 01:03:22,052
Ethan!

721
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:56,211
You all right?

722
01:04:03,844 --> 01:04:05,762
Someone call for help!

723
01:04:06,847 --> 01:04:09,141
Does anyone have a cell phone?

724
01:04:42,674 --> 01:04:44,468
Everybody, get down!

725
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:48,347
Get down! Get down, get down!
Everybody, get down!

726
01:05:04,655 --> 01:05:07,115
- There's a woman down.
- I see her.

727
01:05:24,633 --> 01:05:26,927
Get down! Get down! Stay down!

728
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:30,806
Everybody, get down! Get down!
Stay down!

729
01:05:30,931 --> 01:05:32,266
Get down!

730
01:05:35,644 --> 01:05:36,895
Open up!

731
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,314
Open up! I need the prisoner!

732
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,832
Oh, my God!

733
01:05:57,541 --> 01:05:59,918
It's really bleeding.
Don't leave me, okay?

734
01:06:00,043 --> 01:06:01,962
Don't worry. I'm right here.

735
01:06:02,087 --> 01:06:04,423
Ethan, there's a
G36 in the truck!

736
01:06:04,548 --> 01:06:05,632
I know! I know!

737
01:06:36,038 --> 01:06:38,916
Turn the drone around. There's
an IMF agent in the truck.

738
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:49,009
Ethan! Get out of the truck!

739
01:06:56,475 --> 01:06:57,893
Ethan, move!

740
01:09:08,357 --> 01:09:10,734
- Hello?
- Rick, this is Ethan. Is Julia home?

741
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:13,946
Hey, man. Look, I hope you're
not mad I'm here. It's just...

742
01:09:14,071 --> 01:09:15,364
Rick, I'm not mad.
Is Julia home?

743
01:09:15,489 --> 01:09:17,407
I tried her cell phone,
and there was no answer.

744
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:21,578
No. Sorry. Hey, did
your friend find you?

745
01:09:23,372 --> 01:09:24,790
Which friend?

746
01:09:24,915 --> 01:09:27,501
<i>I don't know. Just
some English guy.</i>

747
01:09:29,837 --> 01:09:31,171
Rick, what did you tell him?

748
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:34,132
<i>Look, it's all good, man. I told
him I didn't know where you were,</i>

749
01:09:34,258 --> 01:09:37,719
<i>and Julia might, and he should
just try her at the hospital.</i>

750
01:09:39,429 --> 01:09:40,597
Hello?

751
01:09:46,645 --> 01:09:49,231
- All right, see you tomorrow, Sally.
- All right. Good night, honey.

752
01:09:56,822 --> 01:09:59,199
<i>Hi. It's Julia. Please
leave me a message...</i>

753
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:10,752
<i>...at 4:00 today, the Chesapeake Bay
Bridge is closed in both directions.</i>

754
01:10:10,878 --> 01:10:12,671
- Sixth floor.
- Sally, this is Ethan.

755
01:10:12,796 --> 01:10:14,840
- I need to talk to Julia.
<i>- Hey, honey.</i>

756
01:10:14,965 --> 01:10:16,675
She just went downstairs.
I'll transfer you.

757
01:10:37,654 --> 01:10:38,864
Damn it!

758
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:40,782
Excuse me.

759
01:10:40,908 --> 01:10:43,243
I was wondering if you knew where
I might find this patient.

760
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:45,954
Probably not. But
I'll know who can.

761
01:10:51,251 --> 01:10:52,711
What's that?

762
01:11:08,018 --> 01:11:09,937
Sally. Where's Julia?

763
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:12,856
- Where's Julia?
- I think she left.

764
01:11:12,981 --> 01:11:15,192
Have you tried the
east building?

765
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:23,659
- Has Julia left yet?
- I haven't seen her.

766
01:11:23,784 --> 01:11:25,994
- Mike, Mike. Have you seen Julia?
- Hey, you okay?

767
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:27,663
- Have you seen Julia?
- No.

768
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:34,002
Watch it, buddy!

769
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:47,266
- Jules?
<i>- You hung me outside of an aeroplane.</i>

770
01:11:47,391 --> 01:11:49,184
<i>You can always tell
someone's character</i>

771
01:11:49,309 --> 01:11:51,812
<i>by the way they treat those
they don't need to treat well.</i>

772
01:11:51,937 --> 01:11:55,816
- If you hurt her, I swear...
<i>- Don't threaten me. Just don't.</i>

773
01:11:55,941 --> 01:11:59,778
<i>The briefcase I picked up in
Rome, the one you took from me,</i>

774
01:11:59,903 --> 01:12:01,989
<i>contains the location
of the Rabbit's Foot.</i>

775
01:12:02,114 --> 01:12:05,492
<i>You're going to get it and bring it to me.
The Rabbit's Foot.</i>

776
01:12:05,617 --> 01:12:08,495
<i>Ethan, you had a watch
last time I saw you.</i>

777
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:11,373
<i>You have 48 hours,
starting on my mark.</i>

778
01:12:11,498 --> 01:12:12,708
Wait, wait, wait.

779
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:14,877
<i>Now, call me at this
number when you have it.</i>

780
01:12:15,002 --> 01:12:17,713
- Just wait.
<i>- Julia's life for the Rabbit's Foot.</i>

781
01:12:17,838 --> 01:12:21,216
<i>- You have 48 hours, or she dies.</i>
- Wait! Wait. Wait.

782
01:12:25,929 --> 01:12:28,223
<i>Condition 1-116. All
units on scene.</i>

783
01:12:28,348 --> 01:12:30,267
We need you to come with us.

784
01:12:30,392 --> 01:12:32,728
Just... Pete, what
the hell is this?

785
01:12:32,853 --> 01:12:35,522
Sorry about that, Mr Hunt. We
were told to bring you in.

786
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:37,774
- Okay.
<i>- Get ready to transport.</i>

787
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:39,651
Whoa. Hey. Just not right now.

788
01:12:39,776 --> 01:12:42,154
- Just tell them you came and that...
- Ethan. Get in.

789
01:12:42,279 --> 01:12:45,616
We don't want to use force here, and
you know we will. Ethan, get in.

790
01:12:45,741 --> 01:12:47,993
- Tell them that you came here...
- Ethan!

791
01:12:48,118 --> 01:12:50,204
...and that I left
already, okay?

792
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:56,335
Freeze!

793
01:12:56,627 --> 01:12:59,755
Ethan, stop! Stop, Ethan!

794
01:13:13,811 --> 01:13:15,604
Yeah. Get his hands.

795
01:13:43,465 --> 01:13:46,426
I reviewed the transcript
of your Berlin operation.

796
01:13:46,552 --> 01:13:48,428
It's very interesting.

797
01:13:48,554 --> 01:13:50,597
It seems that Agent Farris
had some information

798
01:13:50,722 --> 01:13:53,934
she wished to share with you
but not with this agency.

799
01:13:54,059 --> 01:13:55,811
Something you failed to report.

800
01:13:55,936 --> 01:13:59,106
You ordered the Vatican operation
without proper approvals.

801
01:13:59,231 --> 01:14:01,650
That mission resulted in
a catastrophic attack.

802
01:14:01,775 --> 01:14:03,652
And then you fled the scene.

803
01:14:03,777 --> 01:14:06,864
Now, I am not a
stranger to disrespect.

804
01:14:07,698 --> 01:14:10,534
You don't get to where I am
without developing a thick skin.

805
01:14:10,659 --> 01:14:12,828
But what I won't stand for,

806
01:14:13,203 --> 01:14:16,456
what I will lose sleep
over, and I love my sleep,

807
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:20,502
is the idea of an irresponsible
rogue agent working in my office.

808
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:24,381
So I'm going to slow
things way down here.

809
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:29,470
You can look at me

810
01:14:29,595 --> 01:14:32,764
with those judgemental,
incriminating eyes all you want,

811
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:34,558
but I bullshit you not.

812
01:14:34,683 --> 01:14:38,479
I will bleed on the flag to
make sure the stripes stay red.

813
01:14:57,539 --> 01:14:59,833
I don't know what to say to you.

814
01:15:01,043 --> 01:15:03,795
Brassel's right.
You're out of control.

815
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:06,548
Look at me.

816
01:15:08,342 --> 01:15:12,638
Ethan, at least show me the courtesy of
looking at me when I'm talking to you.

817
01:15:21,271 --> 01:15:25,484
I intercepted Davian's call. I know he
wants the Rabbit's Foot for Julia's life.

818
01:15:25,609 --> 01:15:27,069
It's just...

819
01:15:29,488 --> 01:15:30,697
This is

820
01:15:31,532 --> 01:15:33,242
<i>so disappointing.</i>

821
01:15:33,951 --> 01:15:37,329
Go to Shanghai. Feng
Shan Apartments... 1406.

822
01:15:42,251 --> 01:15:45,963
I wish there was something I
could do to help you, but...

823
01:15:51,385 --> 01:15:53,220
Take him to the holding cell.

824
01:17:07,085 --> 01:17:08,504
No, I'm on it.

825
01:17:08,629 --> 01:17:10,714
Yes, sir. There's no need to panic.
I'll get him back.

826
01:17:10,839 --> 01:17:11,882
Sir? Ethan Hunt...

827
01:17:12,007 --> 01:17:13,342
I know what happened.
Give me the radio.

828
01:17:13,467 --> 01:17:16,261
This is Director Brassel. Ethan Hunt
is attempting to escape the building.

829
01:17:16,386 --> 01:17:18,347
He's in the west cargo elevator.
He must be stopped.

830
01:17:18,472 --> 01:17:21,225
I want Mendoza and Graham in
the situation room right away.

831
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:23,060
I'm having the building
surrounded, sir.

832
01:17:23,185 --> 01:17:24,853
I've got units posted
at all the entrances.

833
01:17:24,978 --> 01:17:28,232
<i>This is Brassel again. I'm ordering
a code-six lockdown. I repeat.</i>

834
01:17:28,357 --> 01:17:30,651
- It's Hunt.
- I know it's Hunt.

835
01:17:32,444 --> 01:17:35,155
Hunt was flagged on
sub-basement nine.

836
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,575
I want all security
personnel down there now.

837
01:17:39,117 --> 01:17:40,744
Security channel's jammed.

838
01:17:40,869 --> 01:17:43,956
Hunt must be holding down
the transmit button.

839
01:18:07,521 --> 01:18:08,856
You've got to be kidding me.

840
01:18:20,033 --> 01:18:24,371
<i>Last call for flight 1162 for
Helsinki, now boarding at gate 46.</i>

841
01:18:27,416 --> 01:18:30,085
<i>Final call for Mr Bower.
Final call for Mr Bower.</i>

842
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:31,795
<i>Please come to gate 4.</i>

843
01:18:32,671 --> 01:18:35,549
- Mr Pavel Sobo... Sobotka.
- Sobotka.

844
01:18:35,674 --> 01:18:38,719
Sobotka. Okay. And you're
flying to Shanghai?

845
01:18:42,222 --> 01:18:45,893
I don't speak Czech. I'm sorry.
Let's see about your flight.

846
01:18:46,018 --> 01:18:47,186
Okay.

847
01:18:47,311 --> 01:18:49,146
- Okay.
- Okay.

848
01:20:27,578 --> 01:20:29,079
Don't kill me.

849
01:20:30,622 --> 01:20:31,957
I'm sorry.

850
01:20:33,333 --> 01:20:34,668
I'm sorry.

851
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:39,965
Musgrave told us about Julia.
We're here to help.

852
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:42,176
To get your wife, you'll
need the Rabbit's Foot.

853
01:20:42,301 --> 01:20:44,303
According to the plans
from Davian's briefcase,

854
01:20:44,428 --> 01:20:47,890
it's in a laboratory on the 56th
floor of the Hengshan Lu Building.

855
01:20:48,015 --> 01:20:49,850
Which is a nightmare for
just about every reason.

856
01:20:49,975 --> 01:20:53,437
They're a Chinese military contractor.
We have no pull, no details.

857
01:20:53,729 --> 01:20:55,522
The good news is,
whatever it is,

858
01:20:55,647 --> 01:20:57,900
the Rabbit Foot's small,
so we can steal it.

859
01:20:58,025 --> 01:21:00,694
The bad news, we
got to steal it.

860
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:04,239
From a thief's point of view,
this is worst-case scenario.

861
01:21:04,364 --> 01:21:06,533
The security guards are
all privately-contracted

862
01:21:06,658 --> 01:21:07,993
former People's Liberation Army.

863
01:21:08,118 --> 01:21:10,370
The only access to the lab
is by private elevator.

864
01:21:10,496 --> 01:21:13,123
And that can only be activated
by persons inside the lab.

865
01:21:13,248 --> 01:21:16,084
All of it surveilled by security
cameras within the building.

866
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:18,045
What about the roof?

867
01:21:19,004 --> 01:21:21,757
Four guards full time.
Two on each rooftop.

868
01:21:21,882 --> 01:21:23,634
Langley was a cakewalk
compared to this.

869
01:21:23,759 --> 01:21:25,302
That's the one.

870
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:28,138
- How tall is that building?
- Why?

871
01:21:28,263 --> 01:21:30,557
It's 162 metres at
the highest point.

872
01:21:30,682 --> 01:21:33,101
What about that, the building on the left?
How tall is that one?

873
01:21:33,227 --> 01:21:34,686
Says 226 metres.

874
01:21:34,812 --> 01:21:37,439
226. Distance between
the buildings?

875
01:21:37,564 --> 01:21:39,358
47.55 metres across.

876
01:21:55,999 --> 01:21:57,167
Ethan?

877
01:21:57,918 --> 01:22:00,671
That's good. I think
it's tall enough.

878
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:04,299
- For what?
- A fulcrum.

879
01:22:06,426 --> 01:22:09,096
Oh, you're gonna swing... No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait.

880
01:22:09,221 --> 01:22:11,598
- You could bounce right off the roof.
- Yes, I could.

881
01:22:11,723 --> 01:22:13,851
Even if you made it to the
rooftop, took out the guards,

882
01:22:13,976 --> 01:22:17,563
and got the Rabbit's Foot, you can't just
walk out of the lobby. What's your exit?

883
01:22:17,688 --> 01:22:19,314
Base-jump off the top.
I need a chute.

884
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:21,608
Even at 162, you're pushing
minimum height for a jump.

885
01:22:21,733 --> 01:22:23,277
Chute opens any lower than
that and you're dead.

886
01:22:23,402 --> 01:22:24,444
What are you going to do?

887
01:22:24,570 --> 01:22:26,655
Land in the middle of Shanghai
and hope no one notices?

888
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:28,031
Central Park's two blocks away.

889
01:22:28,157 --> 01:22:30,033
Wait, wait, Ethan, I'm not
saying I have a better idea,

890
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:32,578
but there's a point where
bold becomes stupid.

891
01:22:32,703 --> 01:22:35,164
Now, we don't even know what this
thing is, and you're talking

892
01:22:35,289 --> 01:22:38,125
about handing it over to a guy who
provides terrorists with information.

893
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:40,335
Luther, of course I'm not suggesting
that we just hand it over.

894
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:43,297
We're going to tag the Rabbit's Foot so
we can trace it and know where it is.

895
01:22:43,422 --> 01:22:46,300
Now, you know we can get that gear here.
I just deliver it myself.

896
01:22:46,425 --> 01:22:49,261
We contact Musgrave, have the
IMF trace a tag, order a raid,

897
01:22:49,386 --> 01:22:51,138
get the Rabbit's Foot
back, grab Davian.

898
01:22:51,263 --> 01:22:53,974
Now, if I get out
with Julia, we win.

899
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:56,852
If I don't, then...

900
01:23:03,275 --> 01:23:06,153
Look, then she's dead anyway.
And so am I.

901
01:23:07,362 --> 01:23:08,655
You know?

902
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:13,118
Goddamn it, it's
8:11, it's 8:12.

903
01:23:15,621 --> 01:23:18,749
And we have two hours
before they kill my wife.

904
01:23:19,666 --> 01:23:21,376
Are you in or not?

905
01:23:28,967 --> 01:23:30,677
Of course we're in.

906
01:24:03,001 --> 01:24:04,753
You got 18 minutes.

907
01:24:07,172 --> 01:24:09,049
You're going to
make it over there.

908
01:24:09,174 --> 01:24:12,511
You're going to find the Rabbit's
Foot, get back to the roof,

909
01:24:12,636 --> 01:24:14,429
radio me when you're
ready to make the jump,

910
01:24:14,555 --> 01:24:16,974
and we're going to come get you.

911
01:24:17,975 --> 01:24:19,726
Thank you for coming.

912
01:24:20,477 --> 01:24:21,937
That's my job.

913
01:24:58,265 --> 01:24:59,600
Batter up.

914
01:25:27,377 --> 01:25:30,422
Oh, yeah. They're freaking out.
Hit them again.

915
01:27:05,309 --> 01:27:06,435
Okay.

916
01:27:07,978 --> 01:27:08,979
<i>He made it.</i>

917
01:27:09,188 --> 01:27:10,564
He made it.

918
01:27:13,692 --> 01:27:15,444
I knew he'd make it.

919
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,920
I'm going in. I'll be
out in five minutes.

920
01:27:41,094 --> 01:27:43,472
- It's been 12 minutes.
- He's got five minutes left.

921
01:27:43,597 --> 01:27:47,017
If he doesn't call Davian in
five minutes, Julia's dead.

922
01:27:47,142 --> 01:27:48,477
<i>Anything?</i>

923
01:27:50,062 --> 01:27:51,063
Negative.

924
01:27:51,188 --> 01:27:53,315
<i>How about you? Any good news?</i>

925
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,858
No, nothing.

926
01:27:55,025 --> 01:27:56,527
Come on, Ethan.

927
01:28:05,828 --> 01:28:07,287
What is that?

928
01:28:12,459 --> 01:28:16,755
When I was little I had a cat, and
he used to run away all the time.

929
01:28:18,257 --> 01:28:21,385
And it's just a prayer I'd
say to bring him home.

930
01:28:23,345 --> 01:28:24,847
Teach it to me.

931
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,809
<i>I've got the Rabbit's Foot, but
I can't make it to the roof.</i>

932
01:28:28,934 --> 01:28:31,728
What the hell do you mean you can't
make it to the roof? Where are you?

933
01:28:31,854 --> 01:28:33,897
<i>Look up! Look up, look up!</i>

934
01:28:36,775 --> 01:28:38,944
- Oh, shit.
- He's way too low.

935
01:30:29,721 --> 01:30:32,724
- Ethan! Get in! They're coming!
- Who?

936
01:30:32,850 --> 01:30:35,477
Building security,
and they're pissed.

937
01:30:38,105 --> 01:30:39,940
Okay. Go, go, go, go.

938
01:30:46,822 --> 01:30:48,907
How much time you got left?

939
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:50,993
Less than two minutes.

940
01:30:57,332 --> 01:31:00,460
You gotta get us out of here.
I lost the signal.

941
01:31:03,172 --> 01:31:04,923
- You okay?
- Not yet.

942
01:31:13,307 --> 01:31:14,433
Come on. Come on.

943
01:31:21,857 --> 01:31:23,442
I don't have a signal.
I don't have a signal.

944
01:31:23,567 --> 01:31:24,776
I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm on it!

945
01:31:33,243 --> 01:31:34,328
Zhen!

946
01:31:36,455 --> 01:31:38,081
Damn it. I'm sorry.

947
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:48,008
Put pressure on it.

948
01:31:48,509 --> 01:31:51,637
- Tell me when you get a signal.
- What are you doing?

949
01:32:10,739 --> 01:32:12,282
I got a signal!

950
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:17,913
Hit redial.

951
01:32:20,082 --> 01:32:22,751
<i>You only had five seconds left.
Do you realise that?</i>

952
01:32:22,876 --> 01:32:25,170
The Rabbit's Foot. I have it.

953
01:32:25,546 --> 01:32:29,550
<i>The train yard at Dunan Zhong Lu.
Wait for me there. Alone.</i>

954
01:32:32,845 --> 01:32:34,304
- Yeah?
<i>- Go secure.</i>

955
01:32:34,429 --> 01:32:35,639
We are.

956
01:32:36,765 --> 01:32:38,767
<i>I have the Rabbit's Foot.</i>

957
01:32:38,892 --> 01:32:41,103
- You okay?
- I'm tagging it now.

958
01:32:44,106 --> 01:32:46,441
You need to run a trace. Make
sure we have eyes on this thing.

959
01:32:46,567 --> 01:32:49,528
- What's the tag?
- 6-3-9-6-4-1.

960
01:32:50,487 --> 01:32:51,655
Got it.

961
01:32:54,408 --> 01:32:55,701
I see you on Luang Tao Lu Road.

962
01:32:55,826 --> 01:32:59,329
If you don't hear from me in eight hours,
you send an army after this thing.

963
01:32:59,454 --> 01:33:01,290
- Good luck.
- You, too.

964
01:33:08,714 --> 01:33:10,507
<i>- Mr Musgrave.
- Yeah.</i>

965
01:33:10,757 --> 01:33:12,801
<i>It's come to my attention
that yesterday afternoon</i>

966
01:33:12,926 --> 01:33:14,428
<i>you sent a team to the Far East.</i>

967
01:33:15,053 --> 01:33:17,097
We received intel that
Hadaam Saleen Bahar

968
01:33:17,222 --> 01:33:18,474
was en route to Shanghai.

969
01:33:18,599 --> 01:33:20,893
- Hadaam Saleen Bahar.
- That's right.

970
01:33:21,018 --> 01:33:22,936
You know what I'd love? I'd
love to see that intel.

971
01:33:23,061 --> 01:33:25,481
- I'll be in my office.
- Yes, sir.

972
01:33:38,035 --> 01:33:39,536
Thanks again.

973
01:33:39,953 --> 01:33:41,914
I'll see you back home.

974
01:33:42,831 --> 01:33:44,041
Ethan.

975
01:33:45,250 --> 01:33:48,212
You know they probably
plan to kill you both.

976
01:33:49,922 --> 01:33:52,216
Then I won't see you back home.

977
01:33:53,801 --> 01:33:55,344
Better get back.

978
01:34:42,349 --> 01:34:44,726
Drink it. No questions.

979
01:35:48,332 --> 01:35:49,708
Good morning.

980
01:36:05,641 --> 01:36:06,767
Jules.

981
01:36:07,976 --> 01:36:10,813
We've put an explosive
charge in your head.

982
01:36:10,938 --> 01:36:12,981
Does that sound familiar?

983
01:36:13,732 --> 01:36:16,026
The Rabbit's Foot. Where is it?

984
01:36:16,777 --> 01:36:18,445
I gave it to you.

985
01:36:19,029 --> 01:36:21,240
Now, I'm going to count to 10

986
01:36:21,365 --> 01:36:24,993
and you're going to tell me
where the Rabbit's Foot is

987
01:36:26,411 --> 01:36:27,788
or she dies.

988
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:56,316
Seems we have a lot to talk about.
Don't we?

989
01:36:59,153 --> 01:37:01,071
- Do you think I'm playing?
- Son of a bitch!

990
01:37:01,196 --> 01:37:03,907
Do you think I'm playing?
You don't think I'll do it?

991
01:37:04,032 --> 01:37:05,075
Where is it?

992
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:06,535
- Look at me.
- Where the hell is it?

993
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:07,911
- Look at me. Stay with me.
- Seven!

994
01:37:08,036 --> 01:37:10,247
I am going to kill you. I
swear to God I'm going to...

995
01:37:10,372 --> 01:37:12,207
- Eight!
- No, please.

996
01:37:14,042 --> 01:37:17,546
Please. Don't do this.
Just let her go.

997
01:37:18,172 --> 01:37:21,175
I promise you. I promise you.

998
01:37:21,550 --> 01:37:24,219
- I can figure out how to get whatever...
- Nine.

999
01:37:25,262 --> 01:37:28,182
Listen to me. I want to help
you get whatever you want.

1000
01:37:28,307 --> 01:37:31,852
But you got to do what's right.
What you know is right.

1001
01:37:32,769 --> 01:37:34,229
No, please...

1002
01:37:36,899 --> 01:37:37,941
No.

1003
01:37:40,194 --> 01:37:41,195
No.

1004
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:43,280
- Ten.
- Don't!

1005
01:38:00,130 --> 01:38:03,759
I pushed him as far as he can go.
I know he's not lying.

1006
01:38:04,092 --> 01:38:05,594
I understand.

1007
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:09,389
I've got some questions I
want to ask him first.

1008
01:38:31,829 --> 01:38:33,455
It's complicated.

1009
01:38:40,379 --> 01:38:42,589
You can't just
open the canister.

1010
01:38:42,714 --> 01:38:45,551
We had to make sure you
brought the real thing.

1011
01:38:45,676 --> 01:38:48,971
The Rabbit's Foot. Now we know.

1012
01:38:57,771 --> 01:39:00,983
Don't you touch her!
Don't you touch her!

1013
01:39:10,242 --> 01:39:13,662
Davian's translator,
his Head of Security.

1014
01:39:14,997 --> 01:39:18,125
Remember? At the Vatican
she failed him.

1015
01:39:20,502 --> 01:39:24,673
Ethan, Julia is still alive.

1016
01:39:25,507 --> 01:39:29,344
Davian wanted to kill you both,
but I convinced him otherwise.

1017
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:33,307
Julia hasn't seen me. She doesn't
know anything. She's clean.

1018
01:39:33,474 --> 01:39:35,767
She can go on to have a life.

1019
01:39:36,185 --> 01:39:40,731
As long as you tell me, what
was in Lindsey's message?

1020
01:39:41,732 --> 01:39:44,568
I know she sent you a
microdot from Berlin.

1021
01:39:45,986 --> 01:39:48,447
Did Lindsey know
about me and Davian?

1022
01:39:48,572 --> 01:39:51,492
Is that why she sent the message to you?
Did you read it?

1023
01:39:51,617 --> 01:39:53,243
Did anyone else see it?

1024
01:39:53,368 --> 01:39:55,621
Did she know about the
work I was doing?

1025
01:39:55,746 --> 01:39:57,706
Could I be compromised at IMF?

1026
01:39:57,831 --> 01:39:59,458
Ethan. Ethan.

1027
01:40:00,918 --> 01:40:03,253
Did she buy that
Brassel set her up?

1028
01:40:03,378 --> 01:40:05,088
Did she buy that?

1029
01:40:06,381 --> 01:40:07,800
You told him.

1030
01:40:09,176 --> 01:40:11,637
That's how Davian knew
Lindsey was coming.

1031
01:40:11,762 --> 01:40:13,347
You told him.

1032
01:40:15,307 --> 01:40:17,559
I thought you could
get her back.

1033
01:40:17,684 --> 01:40:21,271
But I wasn't gonna let Brassel, of
all people, undo the work I'd done.

1034
01:40:21,396 --> 01:40:25,818
I took action, Ethan, on behalf of
the working families of our country.

1035
01:40:25,943 --> 01:40:27,319
The Armed Forces,
the White House.

1036
01:40:27,444 --> 01:40:29,363
I'd had enough of Brassel
and his sanctimony.

1037
01:40:29,488 --> 01:40:32,783
IMF Executive Director. He's an
affirmative action poster boy.

1038
01:40:32,908 --> 01:40:36,370
You grab Davian like
he wanted, then what?

1039
01:40:36,954 --> 01:40:38,580
Davian's a weed.

1040
01:40:40,290 --> 01:40:44,336
You cut him out, two more spring
up just like him the next day.

1041
01:40:44,545 --> 01:40:46,421
Arrest him? Then what?

1042
01:40:47,881 --> 01:40:49,258
You use him.

1043
01:40:50,759 --> 01:40:53,387
Collaborate with him.

1044
01:40:54,888 --> 01:40:56,890
And it's Christmas.

1045
01:40:58,725 --> 01:41:01,645
In 18 hours, the Rabbit's
Foot will be delivered

1046
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:05,023
to its Middle Eastern buyer, and we'll
have credible intel to prove it.

1047
01:41:05,149 --> 01:41:07,985
US Security Council will get a
report by this time tomorrow.

1048
01:41:08,110 --> 01:41:11,155
We're talking a military
strike within a week.

1049
01:41:11,572 --> 01:41:13,615
And when the sand settles,

1050
01:41:14,116 --> 01:41:16,577
our country will do
what it does best.

1051
01:41:16,702 --> 01:41:19,371
Clean up. Infrastructure.

1052
01:41:21,123 --> 01:41:22,708
Democracy wins.

1053
01:41:27,087 --> 01:41:29,923
What was Lindsey's message?

1054
01:41:30,966 --> 01:41:34,261
You tell me, and Julia walks.

1055
01:41:36,847 --> 01:41:39,308
It's the only play
you have left.

1056
01:41:40,684 --> 01:41:44,062
Not till I hear her
voice, know she's alive.

1057
01:41:46,231 --> 01:41:47,524
Of course.

1058
01:42:00,662 --> 01:42:01,997
Put her on.

1059
01:42:09,630 --> 01:42:11,297
- Jules?
<i>- Ethan?</i>

1060
01:42:11,298 --> 01:42:11,757
- Jules?
<i>- Ethan?</i>

1061
01:42:12,049 --> 01:42:15,302
When we met, there was a
lake near the mountain.

1062
01:42:17,513 --> 01:42:19,473
What was the lake called?

1063
01:42:20,808 --> 01:42:22,017
<i>Wanaka.</i>

1064
01:42:22,643 --> 01:42:24,186
<i>Please, Ethan.</i>

1065
01:42:24,394 --> 01:42:26,939
- Jules.
<i>- Ethan, I don't understand...</i>

1066
01:42:46,333 --> 01:42:47,835
Benjamin Dunne.

1067
01:42:48,585 --> 01:42:49,628
Benji, it's me.

1068
01:42:49,753 --> 01:42:52,798
<i>- Ethan.</i>
- What? No. Really?

1069
01:42:52,923 --> 01:42:54,591
<i>Listen to me very carefully.
I need your help.</i>

1070
01:42:56,301 --> 01:42:59,513
I need to trace the location of the
last call made from this phone.

1071
01:42:59,638 --> 01:43:01,265
Look, no. Ethan. Shush.

1072
01:43:01,390 --> 01:43:03,100
<i>They're looking...
Everyone's looking for you.</i>

1073
01:43:03,225 --> 01:43:06,270
<i>Everyone I know. They're looking...
I just looked it up.</i>

1074
01:43:06,395 --> 01:43:08,188
<i>Okay, you're on Interpol's
most wanted list.</i>

1075
01:43:08,313 --> 01:43:10,774
And that, by the way, is a
spectacular list to be on.

1076
01:43:10,899 --> 01:43:13,318
<i>Whatever happened, I'm sorry, but
I'm hanging up now right now.</i>

1077
01:43:13,443 --> 01:43:14,653
Benji, I don't have
time for this.

1078
01:43:14,778 --> 01:43:16,405
What do you think happened?
I've been set up.

1079
01:43:16,530 --> 01:43:19,575
I think I like my job.
Okay? A lot.

1080
01:43:19,700 --> 01:43:21,535
All right? And you know they're
gonna be taping this call.

1081
01:43:21,869 --> 01:43:24,580
And you know you can erase it. I'm
giving you the number right now.

1082
01:43:24,705 --> 01:43:26,790
- Are you ready?
- All right. Just hang on.

1083
01:43:26,915 --> 01:43:29,251
I'm gonna lose my citizenship
because of this, you know.

1084
01:43:29,376 --> 01:43:32,212
7-3-4-4-2-5-6-4-3-6-7.

1085
01:43:32,337 --> 01:43:35,090
Okay. Wait. Okay. Hold
the line, please.

1086
01:43:49,438 --> 01:43:51,023
- Are you there?
- Yeah.

1087
01:43:51,148 --> 01:43:52,357
<i>Okay.</i>

1088
01:43:53,066 --> 01:43:56,195
<i>Maybe we can share a jail
cell together, you know?</i>

1089
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:58,864
If this all goes tits
up, which it will.

1090
01:43:58,989 --> 01:44:00,782
The location of that
number is Shanghai.

1091
01:44:00,908 --> 01:44:02,159
There, I just told you.
Shanghai.

1092
01:44:02,284 --> 01:44:04,870
I've just aided and abetted an enemy
of the state. Fantastic. Thank you.

1093
01:44:04,995 --> 01:44:07,289
Am I close? Use this phone
to track my location.

1094
01:44:07,414 --> 01:44:09,792
Oh, you're there.
Well, you're close.

1095
01:44:09,917 --> 01:44:11,668
How close? Is the
signal in the building?

1096
01:44:11,794 --> 01:44:13,212
No, no, no. It isn't
coming from there.

1097
01:44:13,337 --> 01:44:15,130
It's in a building one
mile to the northeast.

1098
01:44:15,255 --> 01:44:16,840
<i>Benji, lead me to the signal.</i>

1099
01:44:29,394 --> 01:44:32,898
<i>There is one thing. What the
hell are you doing in Shanghai?</i>

1100
01:44:33,023 --> 01:44:35,192
I'll tell you when I see you.

1101
01:44:43,742 --> 01:44:45,994
What you... You
need to go north.

1102
01:44:46,119 --> 01:44:48,455
Okay, there's a bridge.
Get to it, cross it.

1103
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:51,917
<i>Make a left. Go three-quarters
of a mile along the river.</i>

1104
01:44:52,042 --> 01:44:53,836
I got it. I got it.

1105
01:45:29,246 --> 01:45:31,165
Good, good. That's right.
Keep going. Keep going.

1106
01:45:31,290 --> 01:45:32,666
Make your next left and
then the next one.

1107
01:45:32,791 --> 01:45:34,376
And then follow that
down 1,000 yards.

1108
01:45:34,501 --> 01:45:36,170
A thousand yards.

1109
01:45:36,545 --> 01:45:39,423
- Okay. Okay, okay.
<i>- Okay, okay. Left. Left.</i>

1110
01:45:40,007 --> 01:45:42,092
Yeah, that's good. That's good.
Keep going. Keep going.

1111
01:45:42,217 --> 01:45:44,344
Okay, now look... Hiya. Hi.

1112
01:45:44,470 --> 01:45:45,929
<i>Benji, where?</i>

1113
01:45:46,054 --> 01:45:48,307
<i>- Benji? Which way do I go?</i>
- Now take a right.

1114
01:45:55,063 --> 01:45:56,523
Okay. Go down, left.

1115
01:45:56,940 --> 01:45:58,775
Left? I'm going left.

1116
01:46:00,694 --> 01:46:01,778
<i>Good, good.</i>

1117
01:46:01,904 --> 01:46:03,614
It's in the second
building on your left.

1118
01:46:03,739 --> 01:46:06,074
The signal bearing's plus
or minus three metres

1119
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:07,326
from the northeast corner.

1120
01:46:07,868 --> 01:46:09,119
I owe you.

1121
01:48:06,403 --> 01:48:08,322
Jules. Jules.

1122
01:48:08,989 --> 01:48:10,616
You're gonna be okay.

1123
01:48:13,660 --> 01:48:14,912
Oh, God!

1124
01:48:15,454 --> 01:48:16,497
God!

1125
01:48:27,174 --> 01:48:29,593
I've activated the
charge in your head.

1126
01:48:35,098 --> 01:48:37,559
You have maybe
four minutes left.

1127
01:48:47,069 --> 01:48:49,738
Didn't I tell you she'd
call out your name?

1128
01:48:55,869 --> 01:48:58,831
Ethan. Ethan.

1129
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:04,044
No.

1130
01:49:08,924 --> 01:49:10,217
Please.

1131
01:49:15,055 --> 01:49:18,392
And I told you I was going
to kill you in front of her?

1132
01:49:18,517 --> 01:49:20,936
Well, I'm going to kill
her in front of you.

1133
01:51:13,590 --> 01:51:14,716
Ethan?

1134
01:51:18,053 --> 01:51:19,513
Are you okay?

1135
01:51:20,597 --> 01:51:22,307
I don't understand
what's going on, Ethan.

1136
01:51:22,432 --> 01:51:25,352
- I know. I know. Just wait.
- What do those men want from you?

1137
01:51:25,477 --> 01:51:28,105
Why are we here? How
did you find me?

1138
01:51:29,231 --> 01:51:32,025
Please, Ethan. What
the hell is going on?

1139
01:51:32,192 --> 01:51:33,485
Are you okay?

1140
01:51:33,610 --> 01:51:37,322
Ethan, what's wrong?
Okay. Oh, God.

1141
01:51:40,450 --> 01:51:44,329
I'm going to tell you everything.
You just stay with me.

1142
01:51:50,961 --> 01:51:53,881
Ethan. What's happening?
What are you looking for?

1143
01:51:54,006 --> 01:51:56,717
- We've got to get out of here.
- Not yet.

1144
01:51:58,510 --> 01:52:00,179
- They don't have one!
- What?

1145
01:52:00,304 --> 01:52:02,723
- A defibrillator.
- A defibrillator?

1146
01:52:02,848 --> 01:52:03,932
Ethan?

1147
01:52:04,725 --> 01:52:08,645
Ethan? Who are these people?
What the hell are we doing here?

1148
01:52:11,565 --> 01:52:12,774
Good!

1149
01:52:14,234 --> 01:52:16,320
This is a Beretta 92F.

1150
01:52:17,154 --> 01:52:18,947
It's a very accurate,
close-range weapon.

1151
01:52:19,072 --> 01:52:21,283
- Don't point it at me.
- Sorry.

1152
01:52:23,285 --> 01:52:24,661
It holds 15 rounds.

1153
01:52:24,787 --> 01:52:28,123
When the mag is empty, the slide
will lock back like this.

1154
01:52:28,248 --> 01:52:30,459
How do you know so
much about this?

1155
01:52:30,584 --> 01:52:33,170
To reload, push this button.

1156
01:52:33,629 --> 01:52:35,172
The empty mag falls out

1157
01:52:35,297 --> 01:52:37,216
and you shove the other one in,

1158
01:52:37,341 --> 01:52:39,802
like the batteries in the
flashlight in the kitchen,

1159
01:52:39,927 --> 01:52:41,845
then release the slide.

1160
01:52:45,057 --> 01:52:47,059
- Why are you giving me a gun?
- There could be others.

1161
01:52:47,184 --> 01:52:48,936
If you have to use
it, you stay low.

1162
01:52:49,061 --> 01:52:51,772
You identify your enemy.
Point and shoot.

1163
01:52:51,897 --> 01:52:53,440
It's very simple.
Point and shoot.

1164
01:52:53,565 --> 01:52:54,942
Stand back.

1165
01:52:56,693 --> 01:52:57,778
Good.

1166
01:52:59,112 --> 01:53:01,824
I have a charge in my head. I'm
going to die unless you kill me.

1167
01:53:01,949 --> 01:53:03,909
- What?
- Throw the switch on and off.

1168
01:53:04,034 --> 01:53:05,452
- Don't forget the off.
- I can't do that.

1169
01:53:05,577 --> 01:53:07,788
You can bring me back.
I'll come back.

1170
01:53:07,913 --> 01:53:10,124
- I can't.
- You have to! There's no time!

1171
01:53:10,249 --> 01:53:11,708
Now! Please!

1172
01:53:18,590 --> 01:53:21,135
Wait, wait! Wait. Wait.
I love you.

1173
01:53:21,426 --> 01:53:22,761
I love you.

1174
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:39,129
Oh, God.

1175
01:54:45,302 --> 01:54:46,762
Come on, baby.

1176
01:54:51,141 --> 01:54:54,561
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

1177
01:54:54,686 --> 01:54:58,273
nine, ten, eleven, twelve,
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

1178
01:55:03,403 --> 01:55:07,908
Come on, baby. I need
you to come back.

1179
01:55:09,326 --> 01:55:10,911
I need you back.

1180
01:55:57,166 --> 01:55:58,459
Oh, God.

1181
01:56:07,718 --> 01:56:09,136
You did that?

1182
01:56:13,015 --> 01:56:14,099
Wow.

1183
01:56:41,001 --> 01:56:43,086
So, I was just thinking...

1184
01:56:45,547 --> 01:56:49,468
I was thinking you might want
to tell me why we're in China.

1185
01:56:51,011 --> 01:56:52,221
I know.

1186
01:56:56,350 --> 01:56:57,392
I...

1187
01:56:59,228 --> 01:57:01,063
I work for an agency.

1188
01:57:02,147 --> 01:57:03,732
It's called IMF.

1189
01:57:06,485 --> 01:57:08,445
What does that stand for?

1190
01:57:09,696 --> 01:57:11,740
Impossible Mission Force.

1191
01:57:12,741 --> 01:57:13,909
Shut up.

1192
01:57:14,827 --> 01:57:16,161
No, I'm not kidding.

1193
01:57:16,286 --> 01:57:20,165
You don't understand. Everything
I'm telling you is top-secret.

1194
01:57:20,290 --> 01:57:22,000
You can trust me.

1195
01:57:22,501 --> 01:57:23,752
Yeah, I know.

1196
01:57:25,170 --> 01:57:27,714
<i>Just wanna show my
appreciation for your work.</i>

1197
01:57:35,222 --> 01:57:39,101
Call it reparations for anything
I might have put you through.

1198
01:57:39,518 --> 01:57:41,603
You should know the White
House has contacted me.

1199
01:57:41,728 --> 01:57:44,064
Now, there's a job that they are

1200
01:57:44,731 --> 01:57:47,317
very interested in
speaking with you about.

1201
01:57:50,779 --> 01:57:53,198
Thank you,

1202
01:57:54,283 --> 01:57:55,409
but I have a lot to think about.

1203
01:57:55,534 --> 01:57:58,579
You aren't considering
quitting, are you, Ethan?

1204
01:57:58,704 --> 01:58:01,290
I'm considering going
on my honeymoon.

1205
01:58:04,293 --> 01:58:05,419
- Have fun.
- Thank you.

1206
01:58:05,544 --> 01:58:06,628
Yeah.

1207
01:58:08,464 --> 01:58:10,007
Hey, one thing.

1208
01:58:11,592 --> 01:58:13,844
The Rabbit's Foot. What is it?

1209
01:58:17,306 --> 01:58:20,100
Promise me you'll
stay, I'll tell you.

1210
01:58:22,728 --> 01:58:25,522
- I'll send you a postcard.
- Fair enough.

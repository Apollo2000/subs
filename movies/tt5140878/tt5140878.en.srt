00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

2
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,323
Think you could hide from me, did you?

3
00:04:19,403 --> 00:04:22,493
Did you read what it said? It said,
"Found you!" And it means that I tickle...

4
00:04:22,573 --> 00:04:25,808
Samuel. Bee. That's enough.

5
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:32,965
- You don't want to get overheated.
- I'm not.

6
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:36,636
You sure? Good. Because now it's my turn!

7
00:04:36,716 --> 00:04:37,870
Dad, help!

8
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,797
You need help? Sure, I can help tickle you.

9
00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:45,467
I think the bottom of these feet
might be very ticklish.

10
00:04:57,936 --> 00:04:59,982
Time for bed, Bee.

11
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:04,986
Thank you.

12
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:15,194
- Love you, Mommy.
- Love you more.

13
00:05:20,191 --> 00:05:21,769
Mommy?

14
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:30,911
- Just for a little while.
- Thanks.

15
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,851
Mommy? Can we play dollies when we get home?

16
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:07,153
Well, I think if you help me
with the washing up...

17
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,656
...I could play dollies
with you all afternoon.

18
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,077
- Sam!
- Yes!

19
00:06:11,157 --> 00:06:12,682
Sam!

20
00:06:13,572 --> 00:06:15,828
- Morning, Sam. Morning, Esther.
- Morning.

21
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,929
Hey, there, busy Bee.

22
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:21,632
Sam, just wondering if you got
that order of mine ready yet.

23
00:06:21,712 --> 00:06:25,721
I got customers coming into my store
every day asking about your dolls.

24
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:29,308
You can send your son over
tomorrow, Vic. They're ready.

25
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:32,644
Well, hallelujah. I guess prayers
do get answered, don't they?

26
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:35,279
- They do.
- All right, well, thank you so much.

27
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:38,440
- Y'all have a good Sunday.
- You have a good day, too.

28
00:06:40,632 --> 00:06:42,215
In you get.

29
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:47,967
- Damn it!
- Language.

30
00:06:52,742 --> 00:06:56,033
There's a car coming. Why don't I wave it
down and see if we can get some help?

31
00:06:56,113 --> 00:06:58,324
No, no, no, no. I got it.

32
00:07:06,221 --> 00:07:08,003
I'll get it!

33
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,705
No!

34
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:02,094
B-L-U-E.

35
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:04,421
Okay, pick a number.

36
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,056
Linda?

37
00:08:10,081 --> 00:08:11,602
Four.

38
00:08:11,682 --> 00:08:13,193
Okay.

39
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,397
"You will soon make new friends."

40
00:08:17,552 --> 00:08:19,223
Do mine now.

41
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:23,971
What's wrong?

42
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:29,653
I just wish you and me were going to
a new home instead of a new orphanage.

43
00:08:30,368 --> 00:08:32,379
Sweet Sue does, too.

44
00:08:36,205 --> 00:08:38,226
It'd be nice to have a home.

45
00:08:38,606 --> 00:08:41,131
Yeah, but only if you're there.

46
00:08:41,211 --> 00:08:43,260
I don't wanna go anywhere you're not.

47
00:08:45,613 --> 00:08:50,429
So, let's swear. If someone wants
one of us, they get both of us.

48
00:08:50,986 --> 00:08:53,675
Okay. I swear.

49
00:08:53,755 --> 00:08:55,411
Good.

50
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:56,752
Me, too.

51
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:00,239
You know what I like most about Sweet Sue?

52
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:02,308
What?

53
00:09:03,897 --> 00:09:05,744
She looks just like you.

54
00:09:08,637 --> 00:09:11,192
So, how much further is it, Father?

55
00:09:11,272 --> 00:09:14,884
Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
you're worse than the children, Sister.

56
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:18,075
The Mullins agreeing to take us in...

57
00:09:18,155 --> 00:09:20,168
- ...was a gift from God.
- Yeah.

58
00:09:20,248 --> 00:09:23,503
What kind of person isn't excited
about getting a gift?

59
00:09:23,983 --> 00:09:28,743
I should mention, don't be alarmed if you
don't see much of Mrs. Mullins at first.

60
00:09:28,823 --> 00:09:32,626
She... has a condition, you see.

61
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:35,380
She was in an accident years ago.

62
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,842
You girls would do well
to help her if need be.

63
00:10:14,132 --> 00:10:16,010
It's big.

64
00:10:49,897 --> 00:10:52,919
Janice... you need help?

65
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:55,846
No, thanks. I can manage.

66
00:11:01,073 --> 00:11:02,663
Sister.

67
00:11:03,743 --> 00:11:07,066
She's one of the unfortunate ones
with that polio outbreak...

68
00:11:07,146 --> 00:11:09,969
...but she's getting stronger every day.

69
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:12,928
She won't be a burden. I promise you.

70
00:11:14,052 --> 00:11:17,744
Mr. Mullins, why don't you
show the girls around?

71
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:20,269
I can unload their belongings.

72
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:23,082
I'll start inside.

73
00:11:23,162 --> 00:11:25,260
Thank you, Father.

74
00:11:34,504 --> 00:11:36,562
This is big as a castle.

75
00:11:36,642 --> 00:11:39,230
Which obviously makes us the princesses.

76
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,378
If this is our new orphanage, I think
I'm just fine with never being adopted.

77
00:11:46,282 --> 00:11:49,606
- There's a TV.
- The television no longer works.

78
00:11:49,686 --> 00:11:51,899
The radio, however, does.

79
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,748
This goes on forever.

80
00:11:59,828 --> 00:12:02,619
You're right. We're gonna need
a map to find our way around.

81
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:04,978
Girls, this way.

82
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:10,909
As you can see, the dining room is more
than adequate to accommodate all of us.

83
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:17,255
- Look in here.
- Let's stay together.

84
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:26,371
Mrs. Mullins and I stay in here.

85
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:30,778
Feel free to use the rest
of the downstairs as you see fit.

86
00:12:30,858 --> 00:12:33,047
Your rooms are upstairs.

87
00:12:33,427 --> 00:12:38,252
Mr. Mullins, is there some way Janice
and I could maybe stay down here?

88
00:12:38,832 --> 00:12:42,111
- Me, too.
- I'll be fine.

89
00:12:56,517 --> 00:12:59,136
I installed it years ago for my wife.

90
00:12:59,216 --> 00:13:01,372
Hasn't been used in ages.

91
00:13:01,452 --> 00:13:03,378
But it works fine.

92
00:13:03,588 --> 00:13:05,433
Try it, Jan.

93
00:13:07,156 --> 00:13:08,987
If you don't, I will.

94
00:13:14,497 --> 00:13:17,521
Up is up. Down is down.

95
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:19,680
But it won't work...

96
00:13:20,984 --> 00:13:23,305
...unless you click the seat belt in...

97
00:13:24,474 --> 00:13:26,452
...like this.

98
00:13:27,944 --> 00:13:29,442
Simple.

99
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:42,501
Thank you.

100
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:41,757
I got dibs on next!

101
00:14:56,126 --> 00:14:57,714
Nice.

102
00:14:57,794 --> 00:15:00,240
I guess this is ours.

103
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:04,587
Let's take that side.

104
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,990
Kate and Tierney can have these.

105
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,282
What about Linda and me?

106
00:15:09,605 --> 00:15:13,263
Relax, Janice. This is a big house.
There are other bedrooms.

107
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:15,332
Why can't Linda and me
have those beds over there?

108
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:19,292
Okay. But then where
would Kate and Tierney sleep?

109
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:29,432
This is neat.

110
00:15:57,584 --> 00:15:59,105
Locked...

111
00:15:59,185 --> 00:16:01,397
...and it stays that way, too.

112
00:16:10,361 --> 00:16:13,442
Hey, Jan. In here.

113
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,382
Hey.

114
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:45,672
Wanna be bunkmates?

115
00:18:02,885 --> 00:18:05,355
- Hey, Sister Charlotte, can we...
- Lord...

116
00:18:05,435 --> 00:18:09,927
...please bless Nancy with the wisdom
to not give people near heart attacks.

117
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:11,261
Sorry.

118
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:13,926
- What is your emergency?
- Can we go exploring?

119
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:15,931
Help Father Massey
with your things first, and...

120
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,468
- But Mr. Mullins is doing that.
- But that doesn't mean you're...

121
00:18:18,548 --> 00:18:22,028
You know how Father Massey is.
We don't wanna get in the way.

122
00:18:23,653 --> 00:18:25,941
- Fine.
- She said "okay"!

123
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,266
But look out for one another!

124
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:34,548
You coming, Jan?

125
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:36,874
Maybe in a little while.

126
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:39,778
Well...

127
00:18:40,434 --> 00:18:42,457
...maybe I'll stay, too.

128
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:44,815
Because you feel sorry for me?

129
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,774
Well...

130
00:18:46,854 --> 00:18:49,998
You promised you wouldn't
treat me any differently.

131
00:18:50,078 --> 00:18:51,589
Okay.

132
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:54,089
See ya!

133
00:20:33,706 --> 00:20:37,765
Dear Lord, thank you
for bringing us all together.

134
00:20:38,845 --> 00:20:41,267
Bless this food for our use...

135
00:20:41,847 --> 00:20:44,126
...and us to thy service.

136
00:20:45,052 --> 00:20:47,707
Fill our hearts with grateful praise...

137
00:20:48,587 --> 00:20:52,401
...and help us give you glory
each day, through.

138
00:20:54,226 --> 00:20:56,882
Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.

139
00:20:56,962 --> 00:20:58,775
Amen.

140
00:21:09,642 --> 00:21:11,653
If you'll excuse me.

141
00:21:46,643 --> 00:21:48,154
Carol.

142
00:21:54,116 --> 00:21:56,328
Keep to your own business.

143
00:22:08,295 --> 00:22:10,637
<i>And if I die before I wake...</i>

144
00:22:10,717 --> 00:22:13,320
...I pray the Lord my soul to take.

145
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,025
Please, God, help Linda and me find
a good home that keeps us together.

146
00:22:17,105 --> 00:22:20,894
- So we can finally be real sisters.
- With good, loving parents.

147
00:22:20,974 --> 00:22:23,496
That hate homework as much as we do.

148
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:27,042
But even if they don't, that's okay, too.

149
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,693
Amen.

150
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,842
"Find me"?

151
00:24:08,374 --> 00:24:09,675
Nancy?

152
00:24:10,876 --> 00:24:12,454
Carol?

153
00:24:13,177 --> 00:24:15,057
Are you guys in here?

154
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,130
Forgive me, Father...

155
00:24:21,818 --> 00:24:23,700
...for I am about to sin.

156
00:31:04,795 --> 00:31:07,817
I heard this is where
Mr. Mullins keeps his wife.

157
00:31:08,527 --> 00:31:12,198
- Does she really wear a mask?
- Yeah, she looked like a doll.

158
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:16,759
Mrs. Mullins, you down there?

159
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:18,650
Stop it.

160
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:21,030
I think he seems nice.

161
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:24,000
Why don't you go find Janice?
See what she's up to.

162
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,970
Why? So you can talk about boys?

163
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,828
Well, do you wanna talk about boys?

164
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,608
Gross. No.

165
00:31:32,688 --> 00:31:36,689
- I wanna play a game.
- Okay, let's play hide and seek.

166
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,315
You go hide, and we'll come look for you.

167
00:31:39,395 --> 00:31:40,751
Okay.

168
00:31:45,933 --> 00:31:48,790
So, are we gonna look for her?

169
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,781
Maybe.

170
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,263
Bless you.

171
00:31:58,343 --> 00:32:00,333
Thank you.

172
00:32:00,413 --> 00:32:01,832
What are you doing?

173
00:32:01,912 --> 00:32:05,038
I asked Mr. Mullins if we could use
this room for our new classroom...

174
00:32:05,118 --> 00:32:07,406
...and he graciously agreed.

175
00:32:07,486 --> 00:32:09,299
Would you like to help?

176
00:32:11,491 --> 00:32:13,303
What's wrong?

177
00:32:14,492 --> 00:32:16,326
I have a sin to confess.

178
00:32:18,497 --> 00:32:21,587
Forgive me, Sister Charlotte,
for I have sinned.

179
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:25,124
- It's been...
- At least two weeks.

180
00:32:26,004 --> 00:32:28,650
...at least two weeks
since my last confession.

181
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:33,165
There's this room upstairs
that we're not supposed to go into.

182
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:35,325
But you did anyway.

183
00:32:36,014 --> 00:32:38,343
- How'd you know?
- Because otherwise...

184
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,862
...why would you be telling me about it?

185
00:32:42,386 --> 00:32:45,042
Well, the door was already open.

186
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:49,811
I don't know how, because
Mr. Mullins always keeps it locked.

187
00:32:49,891 --> 00:32:52,214
When I went inside,
there was this little doll...

188
00:32:52,294 --> 00:32:54,650
- ...and it was really strange in there.
- Janice.

189
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:58,544
- Weird things started to happen.
- Janice, listen to yourself.

190
00:33:00,101 --> 00:33:02,158
What do I always say?

191
00:33:03,388 --> 00:33:06,403
A sin is a sin, no matter the context.

192
00:33:07,877 --> 00:33:12,123
More importantly, you absolutely
cannot disobey the Mullins.

193
00:33:13,748 --> 00:33:16,572
We only just got here and they're
doing a very generous thing...

194
00:33:16,652 --> 00:33:18,897
...by allowing us to stay with them.

195
00:33:20,521 --> 00:33:23,343
If they decide to no longer have us here...

196
00:33:23,423 --> 00:33:25,303
...we'll all be split up.

197
00:33:25,693 --> 00:33:29,082
So, next time you're thinking
of breaking a rule...

198
00:33:29,162 --> 00:33:33,415
...think of how that could affect
the other girls, first.

199
00:33:35,767 --> 00:33:38,925
- Do you understand me?
- Yes. I'm sorry, Sister. I wasn't thinking.

200
00:33:39,005 --> 00:33:40,850
It's okay, love.

201
00:33:42,942 --> 00:33:46,099
For your penance, pray one Hail Mary...

202
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:49,192
...and unpack three of these boxes.

203
00:33:54,386 --> 00:33:56,197
What are you guys doing?

204
00:33:56,887 --> 00:33:58,834
Unpacking boxes.

205
00:34:47,602 --> 00:34:49,614
This place is so creepy.

206
00:35:03,216 --> 00:35:04,496
What was that?

207
00:35:10,224 --> 00:35:12,069
What was that?

208
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,309
How dare you!

209
00:35:23,935 --> 00:35:25,981
Mr. Scarecrow.

210
00:36:38,939 --> 00:36:40,594
Found you.

211
00:36:40,874 --> 00:36:43,087
You're not very good at hiding.

212
00:36:48,515 --> 00:36:51,538
Years of neglect have affected
the counterbalance.

213
00:36:52,118 --> 00:36:54,707
There. That should keep the draft down.

214
00:36:54,787 --> 00:36:56,637
Thank you.

215
00:37:05,064 --> 00:37:09,191
That was taken in Romania
at a convent of cloister nuns.

216
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:11,289
They have little contact
with the outside world...

217
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:14,164
...but I became very close to these three.

218
00:37:14,244 --> 00:37:16,982
That's Sister Maria, that's Sister Anna...

219
00:37:17,342 --> 00:37:19,555
...and that's Sister Lucia.

220
00:37:20,979 --> 00:37:22,825
Who's this?

221
00:37:25,468 --> 00:37:27,815
I don't know. I don't think I even met her.

222
00:37:31,421 --> 00:37:35,068
- Is there anything else you need?
- No, thank you.

223
00:37:38,963 --> 00:37:40,774
Good night.

224
00:37:42,801 --> 00:37:44,644
Good night.

225
00:37:47,802 --> 00:37:51,093
- I like him.
- Which one would you marry?

226
00:37:51,773 --> 00:37:56,020
I don't know. I guess I'll just have
to date all of them to find out.

227
00:37:56,571 --> 00:37:58,487
I just want his eyebrows.

228
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:01,226
- I love his eyes.
- He's very handsome.

229
00:38:25,938 --> 00:38:29,395
Night time is when Mrs. Mullins
gets her powers.

230
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:31,897
That's why she's in bed all day,
but at night...

231
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:35,251
...she can go wherever she wants.
She needs to...

232
00:38:35,331 --> 00:38:37,837
...so she can feed.

233
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:40,473
And if you look directly at her, you'll die.

234
00:38:40,553 --> 00:38:44,776
And to get you to look, she'll keep
saying your name over and over...

235
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:47,302
...till you can't stand it.

236
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,315
Wait.

237
00:38:49,595 --> 00:38:52,641
Nancy. Nancy.

238
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:54,953
- Nancy!
- No, Mrs. Mullins, no!

239
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:56,390
Nancy.

240
00:39:13,616 --> 00:39:15,172
No.

241
00:39:15,452 --> 00:39:17,609
She's ready to feed.

242
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:21,518
Carol! Carol! Carol!

243
00:39:21,598 --> 00:39:24,314
- Stop it. We're not supposed to be up.
- Well, you were doing it, too.

244
00:39:24,394 --> 00:39:25,906
Me?

245
00:39:34,103 --> 00:39:36,748
Okay, why isn't he answering her?

246
00:40:07,535 --> 00:40:09,769
- Nancy...
- Don't look at her.

247
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:14,550
No! No, please, please, please!
Please! No, please.

248
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,302
Please.

249
00:40:27,218 --> 00:40:29,031
She's gone.

250
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,765
She's gone. She's gone.

251
00:40:35,124 --> 00:40:37,710
- What's going on?
- What on God's Earth?

252
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:40,163
Miss Sister Charlotte...
Mrs. Mullins... she was here.

253
00:40:40,243 --> 00:40:42,974
In this room.
She was standing right over there.

254
00:40:43,054 --> 00:40:44,821
Who?

255
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:48,591
Your wife, apparently.
They said she was just in here.

256
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:53,353
That's impossible. My wife
hasn't been able to walk for years.

257
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:19,192
Girls. Girls!

258
00:41:20,035 --> 00:41:22,680
Let's go back to our studies, okay?

259
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:37,762
You okay, Nance?

260
00:41:48,728 --> 00:41:51,236
Did you really see Mrs. Mullins
in your room last night?

261
00:41:51,316 --> 00:41:55,254
- Yes. We swear. We were under the covers...
- Nancy, stop it.

262
00:41:55,334 --> 00:41:58,582
We just freaked ourselves out
last night. You know that.

263
00:42:14,686 --> 00:42:16,774
Mrs. Mullins?

264
00:42:16,854 --> 00:42:21,401
Sister Charlotte, could I trouble you
for a glass of water?

265
00:42:21,861 --> 00:42:23,671
Of course.

266
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:58,292
All of you are more than welcome
to stay as long as you need.

267
00:42:58,992 --> 00:43:01,415
It's good to hear some life again.

268
00:43:02,265 --> 00:43:06,550
We've been cooped up here so long,
I'd forgotten what that sounded like.

269
00:43:08,802 --> 00:43:10,754
What a lovely picture.

270
00:43:10,834 --> 00:43:12,726
She was taken from us...

271
00:43:12,806 --> 00:43:15,830
...at an early age, unfortunately.

272
00:43:17,643 --> 00:43:19,845
If you could turn away for a moment, Sister?

273
00:43:20,245 --> 00:43:22,057
Yes, of course.

274
00:43:23,783 --> 00:43:26,529
I'm very sorry to hear about your daughter.

275
00:43:29,089 --> 00:43:33,202
But we find comfort in knowing
she waits for you in Heaven.

276
00:43:33,792 --> 00:43:35,655
I wish that were true.

277
00:45:28,366 --> 00:45:30,243
Oh, my gosh.

278
00:45:31,768 --> 00:45:33,958
You shouldn't be in here.

279
00:45:34,038 --> 00:45:35,917
Well, neither should you.

280
00:45:46,949 --> 00:45:49,206
Whose room is this, anyways?

281
00:45:49,286 --> 00:45:52,899
The Mullins had a daughter. It was hers.

282
00:45:55,057 --> 00:45:57,212
"Had" one?

283
00:45:57,292 --> 00:45:59,188
I think she died.

284
00:46:01,796 --> 00:46:04,343
And I think that was her
playing the music, too.

285
00:46:09,804 --> 00:46:13,562
- Stop trying to scare me.
- I'm not. It's the truth.

286
00:46:13,642 --> 00:46:15,630
Then why are we in here?

287
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:19,257
- We should leave.
- No. No.

288
00:46:31,293 --> 00:46:32,936
Linda...

289
00:46:33,192 --> 00:46:35,038
...what is it?

290
00:46:36,163 --> 00:46:38,207
We shouldn't be in here.

291
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:41,544
Okay.

292
00:46:42,535 --> 00:46:44,257
I'll leave in a minute.

293
00:46:44,337 --> 00:46:46,149
Well, I'm going.

294
00:47:54,901 --> 00:47:56,913
Who's doing that?

295
00:48:47,584 --> 00:48:49,291
Hi.

296
00:49:02,932 --> 00:49:05,712
You're the Mullins' daughter, aren't you?

297
00:49:08,788 --> 00:49:10,609
What happened to you?

298
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:13,053
Will you help me?

299
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,024
What do you need?

300
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,408
Your soul!

301
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:46,128
Charlotte!

302
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:48,619
Sister Charlotte!

303
00:50:59,707 --> 00:51:01,285
No!

304
00:53:03,124 --> 00:53:05,201
How do you feel?

305
00:53:05,959 --> 00:53:07,770
Give her some space.

306
00:53:11,931 --> 00:53:13,453
Girls...

307
00:53:14,433 --> 00:53:18,561
...Janice is feeling a little down right now
so we need to do what we can to support her.

308
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:22,227
Time, I think, is all she needs.

309
00:53:22,707 --> 00:53:25,808
She'll walk again though, right?

310
00:53:26,711 --> 00:53:28,657
We'll have to see.

311
00:53:30,281 --> 00:53:33,900
You need sleep.
That's gonna help you with the healing.

312
00:53:34,636 --> 00:53:37,244
I can't stay here, Sister Charlotte.

313
00:53:37,955 --> 00:53:41,092
We can't stay here. We need to leave.

314
00:53:41,492 --> 00:53:44,765
Leave? And go where?

315
00:53:47,364 --> 00:53:50,044
There isn't anywhere else for us to go.

316
00:53:50,768 --> 00:53:53,612
I didn't fall down those stairs.

317
00:53:54,437 --> 00:53:56,249
Something threw me.

318
00:53:56,973 --> 00:53:58,784
What do you mean?

319
00:54:01,277 --> 00:54:03,365
You always say that...

320
00:54:03,445 --> 00:54:06,267
...even though we can't see God, we can...

321
00:54:06,347 --> 00:54:08,437
...we can feel his presence.

322
00:54:09,117 --> 00:54:10,669
Well...

323
00:54:11,024 --> 00:54:14,530
...in this house I feel
a different kind of presence.

324
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:16,935
What kind?

325
00:54:20,862 --> 00:54:22,588
An evil one.

326
00:54:22,998 --> 00:54:26,254
It's coming after me. Coming after my soul.

327
00:54:26,334 --> 00:54:29,991
- Your soul?
- Because I'm the weakest.

328
00:54:30,071 --> 00:54:31,976
No, darling.

329
00:54:32,056 --> 00:54:33,511
Listen...

330
00:54:33,591 --> 00:54:36,197
...the devil preys on those weak in faith...

331
00:54:36,277 --> 00:54:38,681
...not weak of flesh or bone.

332
00:54:38,761 --> 00:54:42,392
You are as strong as any of us, Janice.

333
00:54:43,983 --> 00:54:45,729
Stronger.

334
00:55:02,167 --> 00:55:04,181
You're quiet, Samuel.

335
00:55:05,671 --> 00:55:07,726
I think it was a mistake...

336
00:55:08,506 --> 00:55:10,786
...to bring the girls here.

337
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:13,086
Why?

338
00:55:15,678 --> 00:55:17,534
The girl...

339
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,626
...the girl that fell...

340
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,687
...maybe she didn't fall.

341
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:24,931
Maybe...

342
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:27,433
It was an accident.

343
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:30,280
That's all it was.

344
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,237
Accidents happen.

345
00:55:36,698 --> 00:55:39,745
It's been quiet for 12 years.

346
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:44,726
You should try embracing
the presence of the girls...

347
00:55:45,706 --> 00:55:48,339
...instead of frightening them away.

348
00:55:52,779 --> 00:55:54,460
<i>You'll be better soon.</i>

349
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:56,662
I don't think so.

350
00:55:58,818 --> 00:56:00,388
Not this time.

351
00:56:00,988 --> 00:56:02,867
But you have to.

352
00:56:04,191 --> 00:56:06,670
Pretty soon, we'll find a new home.

353
00:56:07,728 --> 00:56:11,555
No one's gonna want me now.
I'd just be a burden.

354
00:56:13,267 --> 00:56:15,946
But you swore we'd stick together.

355
00:56:16,437 --> 00:56:18,047
I take it back.

356
00:56:21,874 --> 00:56:23,680
Maybe I won't get adopted.

357
00:56:28,614 --> 00:56:31,839
You will. You know why?

358
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:34,789
Because you're special.

359
00:56:36,254 --> 00:56:40,746
You're gonna get adopted
by a nice family somewhere...

360
00:56:41,026 --> 00:56:43,516
...and they're gonna spoil you so much.

361
00:56:44,396 --> 00:56:48,485
You're gonna have so many dolls that
you won't even be able to name all of them.

362
00:56:48,565 --> 00:56:50,189
Sure, I can.

363
00:56:50,269 --> 00:56:54,317
Janice one. Janice two, Janice three.

364
00:56:55,873 --> 00:56:57,385
Linda?

365
00:56:57,475 --> 00:56:59,287
Time for bed.

366
00:57:01,379 --> 00:57:03,534
I wish you'd come upstairs.

367
00:57:04,881 --> 00:57:06,859
I don't wanna sleep alone.

368
00:57:08,986 --> 00:57:10,764
Here.

369
00:57:11,288 --> 00:57:13,242
Take Becca.

370
00:57:13,322 --> 00:57:14,902
This way...

371
00:57:15,792 --> 00:57:17,538
...I'll always be with you.

372
00:57:20,897 --> 00:57:23,343
Then you should have Sweet Sue.

373
00:57:25,968 --> 00:57:27,779
Thank you.

374
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:34,095
Remember, before all of this...

375
00:57:34,175 --> 00:57:38,345
...when we used to sneak around
the orphanage at night?

376
00:57:38,425 --> 00:57:41,167
And eat all the chocolate in the pantry?

377
00:57:41,247 --> 00:57:44,728
Father Massey was convinced that we had mice.

378
00:57:45,985 --> 00:57:50,743
"Oh, Lord. Please cleanse
my soul of all my sins...

379
00:57:50,823 --> 00:57:53,048
"...and cleanse our house...

380
00:57:53,128 --> 00:57:55,940
- "...of these mice!"
- "These mice!"

381
00:58:02,234 --> 00:58:04,444
No matter what happens...

382
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:09,318
...nothing can erase all of
those things we did together.

383
00:58:12,344 --> 00:58:14,255
Night, Linda.

384
00:58:14,346 --> 00:58:16,458
Good night, Janice.

385
01:03:15,656 --> 01:03:18,415
A little sunlight will do you some good.

386
01:03:18,495 --> 01:03:21,576
I don't think the sunlight
can fix what's wrong with me.

387
01:03:22,767 --> 01:03:25,246
You mustn't give up hope.

388
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:29,046
Hope is a home unto itself.

389
01:03:29,126 --> 01:03:31,908
Dwell in it,
and it will protect and keep you.

390
01:03:34,011 --> 01:03:36,423
What book of the Bible is that from?

391
01:03:38,413 --> 01:03:40,425
The book of Charlotte.

392
01:03:41,052 --> 01:03:43,696
But that doesn't make it any less so.

393
01:03:45,054 --> 01:03:46,876
Are you okay here?

394
01:03:48,356 --> 01:03:50,547
The sunlight actually feels kinda nice.

395
01:03:50,627 --> 01:03:52,504
I told you.

396
01:04:29,897 --> 01:04:31,808
Sister Charlotte?

397
01:04:37,536 --> 01:04:40,123
No! No, no, no!

398
01:04:40,203 --> 01:04:42,818
Stop, please!

399
01:06:16,996 --> 01:06:18,540
Janice!

400
01:06:21,366 --> 01:06:23,098
Janice!

401
01:06:25,136 --> 01:06:27,014
What's going on?

402
01:06:29,207 --> 01:06:32,854
- I couldn't get out.
- Are you okay?

403
01:06:36,446 --> 01:06:38,292
I'm fine.

404
01:06:44,789 --> 01:06:46,877
I'm worried about Janice.

405
01:06:47,657 --> 01:06:51,247
- A few nights ago, she wanted to leave.
- Why'd she wanna leave?

406
01:06:51,327 --> 01:06:53,883
Probably because this place is off the wall.

407
01:06:54,263 --> 01:06:58,021
She told me the Mullins' daughter
was coming for her.

408
01:06:58,101 --> 01:07:00,489
The Mullins had a daughter?

409
01:07:00,569 --> 01:07:02,776
She died a long time ago.

410
01:07:03,406 --> 01:07:05,617
So she's seeing ghosts?

411
01:07:07,276 --> 01:07:08,862
Keep your voice down.

412
01:07:09,312 --> 01:07:11,557
So she's seeing ghosts?

413
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:13,970
I guess.

414
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:17,063
Well, you guys saw something.

415
01:07:17,486 --> 01:07:21,575
That wasn't a ghost.
Ghosts can only be of dead people.

416
01:07:22,055 --> 01:07:24,578
But how does that explain what you saw?

417
01:07:24,658 --> 01:07:27,338
Unless it really was Mrs. Mullins.

418
01:07:28,429 --> 01:07:32,415
Or... something was just trying to scare you.

419
01:07:33,665 --> 01:07:36,713
You guys are doing a good job
of that on your own.

420
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:45,047
Janice is probably just looking for ways
to justify us treating her differently.

421
01:07:46,061 --> 01:07:48,784
- I don't think so.
- Of course you don't.

422
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:51,252
You'll know what I mean when you're older.

423
01:07:51,382 --> 01:07:53,461
Now go, get to bed.

424
01:08:27,983 --> 01:08:29,773
What are you waiting for?

425
01:08:29,953 --> 01:08:31,531
Nothing.

426
01:08:35,758 --> 01:08:37,569
You like it?

427
01:08:37,959 --> 01:08:39,772
It's nice.

428
01:08:44,165 --> 01:08:46,178
It's not my finest work.

429
01:08:57,108 --> 01:08:59,109
You seem troubled.

430
01:08:59,713 --> 01:09:01,525
Maybe I can help.

431
01:09:02,717 --> 01:09:04,341
I don't think so.

432
01:09:04,651 --> 01:09:07,944
Talking about the things
that bothers us, sometimes...

433
01:09:08,855 --> 01:09:10,934
...it's all the help we need.

434
01:09:11,927 --> 01:09:13,470
Well...

435
01:09:15,294 --> 01:09:17,184
...it's Janice.

436
01:09:17,264 --> 01:09:19,310
She's acting funny.

437
01:09:20,501 --> 01:09:22,645
"Acting funny"?

438
01:09:23,435 --> 01:09:25,248
She says...

439
01:09:27,107 --> 01:09:29,385
...she's seen your daughter.

440
01:09:31,610 --> 01:09:33,488
My daughter...

441
01:09:35,882 --> 01:09:38,446
...has been dead for a very, very long time.

442
01:09:41,402 --> 01:09:43,206
I know, but...

443
01:09:43,386 --> 01:09:46,711
...you see, Janice went into her bedroom.

444
01:09:46,791 --> 01:09:48,779
She what?

445
01:09:48,859 --> 01:09:51,549
She knows she wasn't supposed to, but...

446
01:09:51,629 --> 01:09:55,243
- ...she found this doll and...
- What doll?

447
01:09:55,467 --> 01:09:58,578
- The one in the white dress.
- That's impossible.

448
01:09:58,658 --> 01:10:02,473
That doll was hidden away.
She mustn't go near that doll.

449
01:10:02,553 --> 01:10:04,668
Do you understand me?

450
01:11:31,721 --> 01:11:34,279
Janice, I told you not to use that room.

451
01:11:34,569 --> 01:11:36,960
<i>Please don't take</i>

452
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:40,298
<i>My sunshine away</i>

453
01:12:20,567 --> 01:12:22,379
Stay here.

454
01:12:24,271 --> 01:12:26,083
Mr. Mullins?

455
01:12:31,659 --> 01:12:33,735
Mr. Mullins, are you okay?

456
01:12:52,397 --> 01:12:54,385
Go get ready for bed, girls.

457
01:12:54,465 --> 01:12:56,477
I need to speak to Mrs. Mullins.

458
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:09,123
Linda, what are you doing?

459
01:16:09,597 --> 01:16:13,877
This doll... it's hurting Janice,
and it killed Mr. Mullins.

460
01:16:14,316 --> 01:16:16,395
I'm getting rid of it!

461
01:16:23,159 --> 01:16:25,372
Linda, let's go back.

462
01:16:39,975 --> 01:16:41,487
Linda?

463
01:16:48,416 --> 01:16:51,060
No! No!

464
01:17:08,102 --> 01:17:10,945
- What is that?
- Who cares? Run!

465
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:23,258
Janice. Janice, I got rid of it.

466
01:17:23,338 --> 01:17:25,361
I got rid of the doll.

467
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:30,737
Janice? Janice?

468
01:17:30,957 --> 01:17:32,692
- What's going on?
- Where's Janice?

469
01:17:32,772 --> 01:17:36,590
- I don't know.
- Go find her. Hurry!

470
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:43,106
What's going on?

471
01:17:43,186 --> 01:17:46,247
No! No! Get that thing away from me!

472
01:17:49,139 --> 01:17:52,629
It's back. I knew it was back.

473
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:54,720
What is it?

474
01:17:55,245 --> 01:17:57,057
The evil.

475
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:59,793
The devil itself.

476
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:02,695
What are you talking about?

477
01:18:03,653 --> 01:18:07,210
After Samuel and I lost our daughter...

478
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:10,770
...we prayed and promised our devotion to...

479
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:13,445
...whatever power would allow us to...

480
01:18:13,525 --> 01:18:17,526
...speak or see our beloved girl again.

481
01:18:18,268 --> 01:18:21,112
<i>It started small, the contact.</i>

482
01:18:27,075 --> 01:18:31,165
<i>But it was her... our busy Bee.</i>

483
01:18:31,245 --> 01:18:33,068
<i>We knew it was her.</i>

484
01:18:34,548 --> 01:18:37,204
<i>She wanted permission
to move into the doll...</i>

485
01:18:37,284 --> 01:18:39,930
<i>...so she could be with us forever.</i>

486
01:18:52,548 --> 01:18:57,281
<i>We said "yes,"
and that's when it became stronger.</i>

487
01:19:00,105 --> 01:19:02,725
<i>Soon, we could actually see her.</i>

488
01:19:03,475 --> 01:19:06,253
<i>Only in fleeting glimpses, but it was enough.</i>

489
01:19:08,013 --> 01:19:10,070
<i>Our beloved Bee...</i>

490
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:11,957
<i>...our darling.</i>

491
01:19:12,037 --> 01:19:13,611
Annabelle?

492
01:19:21,961 --> 01:19:23,948
<i>Even though I couldn't hold her...</i>

493
01:19:24,028 --> 01:19:27,375
<i>...it was comforting just to have
the buzz of activity again.</i>

494
01:19:32,369 --> 01:19:36,217
<i>But we soon realized
it wasn't our Annabelle at all.</i>

495
01:20:38,765 --> 01:20:40,077
Esther?

496
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:42,412
Esther?

497
01:20:54,796 --> 01:20:58,535
It was a demonic presence,
and it was using our Annabelle...

498
01:20:58,615 --> 01:21:02,305
...to manipulate us into giving it
a soul it could inhabit.

499
01:21:02,385 --> 01:21:04,315
It tried to take mine...

500
01:21:04,395 --> 01:21:07,018
...but Samuel reached out to the Church.

501
01:21:08,058 --> 01:21:09,679
They saved my soul...

502
01:21:09,759 --> 01:21:12,369
...but the evil
was still attached to that doll.

503
01:21:14,163 --> 01:21:16,553
So we locked it away...

504
01:21:16,633 --> 01:21:19,680
<i>...where it could be surrounded
by the word of God.</i>

505
01:22:03,778 --> 01:22:06,634
It was quiet for all these years.

506
01:22:07,114 --> 01:22:09,958
I thought the evil was contained.

507
01:22:10,951 --> 01:22:14,506
We thought helping the girls
could be our penance.

508
01:22:14,586 --> 01:22:18,233
But we ended up giving it
just what it wanted.

509
01:22:31,035 --> 01:22:32,547
Janice.

510
01:22:37,908 --> 01:22:39,731
She can walk.

511
01:22:39,811 --> 01:22:42,089
It's just us, Janice.

512
01:22:42,944 --> 01:22:45,492
Time to cease from sin, Carol.

513
01:22:51,889 --> 01:22:54,977
Sister Charlotte!
Sister Charlotte! It's Janice.

514
01:22:55,057 --> 01:22:56,815
- She did this to me.
- Look what she did!

515
01:22:56,895 --> 01:22:58,614
- Carol, call for help.
- Okay.

516
01:22:58,694 --> 01:23:00,773
And stay together.

517
01:23:05,968 --> 01:23:08,580
They're on the way. Let's get somewhere safe.

518
01:23:12,874 --> 01:23:16,701
- What do we do?
- We can't just leave her here, can we?

519
01:23:28,689 --> 01:23:30,569
Mrs. Mullins?

520
01:23:32,794 --> 01:23:34,605
Mrs. Mullins?

521
01:23:36,330 --> 01:23:38,207
Mrs. Mullins?

522
01:23:56,082 --> 01:23:57,770
Girls!

523
01:23:57,850 --> 01:24:00,294
Let's go. Now!

524
01:24:03,454 --> 01:24:07,268
Forgive me, Sister, for I have sinned.

525
01:24:37,353 --> 01:24:40,166
- Charlotte! Charlotte!
- Let's go!

526
01:24:43,443 --> 01:24:44,955
Linda!

527
01:24:46,932 --> 01:24:49,485
Go, Kate! Get help!

528
01:24:49,565 --> 01:24:51,075
Or...

529
01:24:51,667 --> 01:24:53,558
...you could help me.

530
01:25:05,845 --> 01:25:07,658
The truck!

531
01:25:08,115 --> 01:25:10,526
Come on, come on, come on.

532
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:15,565
- Come in. Close the door, close the door!
- Come on! Go!

533
01:25:22,728 --> 01:25:25,093
- No!
- Go! Go!

534
01:25:25,173 --> 01:25:26,641
Go!

535
01:25:28,401 --> 01:25:29,913
Look.

536
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,158
- No!
- Hurry!

537
01:25:33,238 --> 01:25:35,516
- I'm trying!
- It's there!

538
01:25:42,647 --> 01:25:44,837
- It's not moving.
- I'm trying, I'm trying!

539
01:25:44,917 --> 01:25:46,459
Guys!

540
01:25:49,587 --> 01:25:52,510
- Guys! Guys!
- What? What?

541
01:25:52,590 --> 01:25:55,670
- The scarecrow.
- What scarecrow?

542
01:25:57,061 --> 01:25:58,573
What?

543
01:26:00,797 --> 01:26:02,757
- Kate!
- Get out!

544
01:26:22,116 --> 01:26:24,598
The barn! The barn!

545
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:30,903
Carol.

546
01:26:33,696 --> 01:26:35,207
What?

547
01:26:37,866 --> 01:26:42,091
No! No! Nancy, I can't get
the door open. Is it locked?

548
01:26:42,171 --> 01:26:44,002
Can you get it from your side?

549
01:26:45,208 --> 01:26:46,752
Girls?

550
01:26:47,442 --> 01:26:49,054
Nancy?

551
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:13,582
No.

552
01:28:20,561 --> 01:28:23,773
No. No, no, no, no!

553
01:29:42,939 --> 01:29:47,430
Lord, help me. Lord, help. Help.

554
01:29:48,713 --> 01:29:51,555
Carol, it's me. It's just me.

555
01:29:52,246 --> 01:29:53,807
Come on.

556
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:00,965
Linda?

557
01:32:05,036 --> 01:32:06,615
Shoot.

558
01:32:18,950 --> 01:32:20,461
No!

559
01:32:22,253 --> 01:32:23,861
No!

560
01:33:40,726 --> 01:33:42,538
Sister Charlotte?

561
01:34:08,820 --> 01:34:11,900
You know what I like most about Sweet Sue?

562
01:34:16,759 --> 01:34:19,205
She looks just like you.

563
01:34:56,597 --> 01:34:58,175
Linda?

564
01:34:59,566 --> 01:35:01,833
Where are you, Linda?

565
01:35:05,705 --> 01:35:06,820
Linda?

566
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:20,238
Linda?

567
01:35:20,318 --> 01:35:22,529
Come out and play.

568
01:35:47,544 --> 01:35:49,389
Found you!

569
01:35:51,581 --> 01:35:53,583
You swore that if I found a home,
you'd come, too.

570
01:35:53,663 --> 01:35:56,663
You know what they say
about breaking a swear.

571
01:35:56,743 --> 01:35:59,566
- You go straight to hell.
- Janice!

572
01:36:06,078 --> 01:36:07,546
Forgive me.

573
01:36:08,396 --> 01:36:09,907
No!

574
01:36:11,299 --> 01:36:14,443
Let me out! Let me out!

575
01:36:15,103 --> 01:36:17,148
Let me out!

576
01:36:50,203 --> 01:36:51,348
Go!

577
01:36:58,678 --> 01:37:00,190
Go!

578
01:37:09,186 --> 01:37:11,666
- Sister Charlotte!
- Sister Charlotte!

579
01:38:50,299 --> 01:38:51,887
Anything?

580
01:38:52,217 --> 01:38:53,967
I'm afraid not.

581
01:38:54,047 --> 01:38:56,263
Still no sign of the girl.

582
01:38:56,354 --> 01:38:58,232
But at her age...

583
01:38:58,789 --> 01:39:00,867
...how far could she have gone?

584
01:39:02,899 --> 01:39:04,771
Don't worry.

585
01:39:05,263 --> 01:39:07,140
We'll find her.

586
01:39:13,970 --> 01:39:19,003
The house is blessed.
Whatever evil was here is no longer.

587
01:39:20,276 --> 01:39:21,830
But...

588
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:23,600
...the doll.

589
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:26,485
It was a conduit for the evil.

590
01:39:26,565 --> 01:39:28,772
That evil has moved on.

591
01:39:29,252 --> 01:39:31,506
Now the doll is just a doll.

592
01:39:31,586 --> 01:39:33,095
So...

593
01:39:33,824 --> 01:39:36,055
...which one of you gets this?

594
01:40:01,313 --> 01:40:03,156
How are you holding up?

595
01:40:05,450 --> 01:40:07,263
I'm okay.

596
01:40:09,889 --> 01:40:13,303
You know, that wasn't Janice
back there. That was...

597
01:40:14,792 --> 01:40:16,605
...something else.

598
01:40:20,615 --> 01:40:22,427
I know.

599
01:41:02,036 --> 01:41:06,662
Hi, there. Welcome.
Let's go right inside, shall we?

600
01:41:09,244 --> 01:41:13,801
She mostly keeps to herself and can be
a bit quiet, but she's a lovely girl.

601
01:41:13,881 --> 01:41:16,160
She's just been through a lot.

602
01:41:17,418 --> 01:41:19,496
I think you will love her.

603
01:41:22,122 --> 01:41:23,863
Hello.

604
01:41:23,943 --> 01:41:26,420
There's someone here to see you, sweetie.

605
01:41:28,896 --> 01:41:32,342
I wanna introduce you
to Mr. and Mrs. Higgins.

606
01:41:34,368 --> 01:41:36,906
And you must be...

607
01:41:36,986 --> 01:41:39,107
- Annabelle.
- Annabelle?

608
01:41:39,187 --> 01:41:41,285
What a lovely name.

609
01:41:42,507 --> 01:41:44,587
We brought you a present.

610
01:41:47,812 --> 01:41:49,826
I hope you like dolls.

611
01:42:36,891 --> 01:42:38,580
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

612
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:40,032
What is it?

613
01:42:40,112 --> 01:42:42,116
- You stay here.
- No, no, no! No, wait!

614
01:42:42,196 --> 01:42:45,117
It's all right. It's okay. It's all right.
I'm just gonna take a quick look.

615
01:42:45,197 --> 01:42:47,011
Call the police.

616
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:03,493
- Annabelle!
- Hi, Mom.

617
01:43:26,005 --> 01:43:27,550
John?

618
01:43:28,305 --> 01:44:28,722

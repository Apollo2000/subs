1
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,199
The School of Bastøy existed from 1900 - 1953

2
00:00:49,205 --> 00:00:52,505
It was a school for misfitted young boys

3
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,530
This film was based on true events.

4
00:01:10,755 --> 00:01:13,555
I once saw a whale swim
with three harpoons in it.

5
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,404
It took an entire day to die.

6
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:30,121
We found the wale again, and proceeded to
come closer; closer than we had ever come before.

7
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,044
He was weaker due to the harpoon
I shot him with, -

8
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,081
- covered with scars
from all the the battles he had fought.

9
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,000
It is not as strict as they say it is.

10
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,485
They have Sundays free.

11
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,964
Shut up.

12
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,500
THE KING OF DEVIL'S ISLAND

13
00:03:27,847 --> 00:03:31,476
They will enter cell C.
That is your responsibility, until you leave.

14
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:35,959
-What is it now, three weeks?
-Yes, Sir.

15
00:03:36,127 --> 00:03:38,243
Ensure that they learn.

16
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,901
No tobacco, No alcohol,
No civilian clothes,

17
00:03:49,926 --> 00:03:52,426
No games, cards, or dice.

18
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,351
No discussion during work.

19
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,851
- No obscene behavior, No personal belongings.

20
00:03:59,727 --> 00:04:03,241
What is this?
Private asset?

21
00:04:03,446 --> 00:04:08,645
Address me as House-Father Bråthen.
C5, C19, These are is your numbers.

22
00:04:08,806 --> 00:04:11,957
Take off your clothes,
fold them, and place here.

23
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,196
You will receive new clothes
down below in the barracks.

24
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:15,560
One thing.

25
00:04:16,206 --> 00:04:19,915
I observe everything.
I see everything, I hear everything.

26
00:04:20,086 --> 00:04:24,637
And I write everything down in my book.
Is that understood?

27
00:04:31,846 --> 00:04:33,643
Sit on your hands.

28
00:05:41,644 --> 00:05:43,157
Stand straight.

29
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:49,237
Take down your hands.

30
00:06:04,523 --> 00:06:08,038
What happened to your face?

31
00:06:08,203 --> 00:06:09,875
Police.

32
00:06:11,843 --> 00:06:14,721
It could have been a lot worse
if you had been in prison.

33
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,794
Hence why I ensured that you
made your way here.

34
00:06:16,963 --> 00:06:20,717
Since you're a sailor
you know how important discipline is.

35
00:06:21,123 --> 00:06:24,798
You're part of the crew with one common goal.

36
00:06:25,163 --> 00:06:26,801
Yes.

37
00:06:27,523 --> 00:06:28,956
Yes...

38
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:30,238
Yes, Sir.

39
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:32,434
Yes, Sir.

40
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:35,240
Yes, Sir.

41
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:41,921
I am your captain,
and this island is my vessel.

42
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:45,791
The House-Parents are my mates,
the boy C1, Olav Fossen, -

43
00:06:45,962 --> 00:06:48,078
- he is one of you.

44
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,675
However, he is your leader.

45
00:06:50,122 --> 00:06:53,671
Our goal, and your goal. Is to find,

46
00:06:53,842 --> 00:06:57,835
- the honorable, humble, useful, Christian boy inside you.

47
00:06:58,002 --> 00:07:02,757
And we're going to shape and polish him.
If we do not find him...

48
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,719
you'll remain here.

49
00:07:05,282 --> 00:07:07,000
Do you understand?

50
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:09,755
Yes, Sir.

51
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,838
At this island, we don't speak about
what anyone has done, or participated in.

52
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,789
There is no past nor future.
There is only the present.

53
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,999
If whole world crumbles under the waves, -

54
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,392
- it has nothing to do with us,
isn't that true, C-19?

55
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,833
Yes, Sir.

56
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,277
Learn the rules and follow them.
So we see that you get what you need.

57
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,000
Bråthen.

58
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,034
Bråthen!

59
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:43,154
Cabin coordinator C1 will perhaps leave us soon,
and his space will soon be available.

60
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,351
What an ambitious and dedicated young man.

61
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,358
You can go now.

62
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,797
Is that him?

63
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,358
I don't like the idea of having
someone like him here.

64
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,112
This place is about to disintegrate.

65
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,748
- I can no longer be here.
-Stop.

66
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:24,269
C-1 to 6 will clear the northern field.
C-8 to 12 will shovel fertilizer with Bjarne.

67
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:27,351
Hey! Anyone who complains,
will receive the same job tomorrow.

68
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,829
New-boy, C-19, you have outhouse duties.

69
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:35,117
Is there anyone here who will volunteer
to show 19 how this will be done?

70
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:37,634
I'll show him.

71
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:48,915
We call it America.
Because the House-Parents don't come down here.

72
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:51,468
This is where we live in peace.

73
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:58,239
You'll get used to it.

74
00:09:01,158 --> 00:09:04,594
I'm not going to be here very long.

75
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:36,989
C-5, come with me,
We need a man in laundry.

76
00:09:51,997 --> 00:09:55,433
There was someone who tried once.

77
00:09:56,757 --> 00:09:59,988
However, it hasn't happened
since I've been here.

78
00:10:00,157 --> 00:10:01,954
It's too far across.

79
00:10:02,117 --> 00:10:05,154
-When did you come here?
-Six years ago.

80
00:10:05,317 --> 00:10:08,070
You must love it here.

81
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:13,228
Is it true that you killed someone?

82
00:10:13,397 --> 00:10:18,231
I thought we didn't talk about
what we've done before.

83
00:10:20,276 --> 00:10:23,552
The boathouse is closed.
You can't get in there.

84
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:30,513
The only way out from the island
is the manager's signature

85
00:10:30,676 --> 00:10:34,794
-And you're getting it?
-Yeah, I get it when the committee comes.

86
00:10:34,956 --> 00:10:38,187
You're like the captain's cabin boy.

87
00:11:32,074 --> 00:11:35,032
Arni, come.
Arni!

88
00:11:57,954 --> 00:12:00,070
Put up your hand.

89
00:12:02,874 --> 00:12:04,830
Hold it still!

90
00:12:11,073 --> 00:12:15,783
He hasn't learned the rules yet.
But he wants to, right?

91
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:17,671
Yes, Sir.

92
00:12:19,393 --> 00:12:23,147
He wants to get away from here,
and he will.

93
00:12:23,313 --> 00:12:26,111
When he's earned it.

94
00:12:26,273 --> 00:12:28,548
Yes, Sir.

95
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,066
Is that your mom?

96
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,787
Lights out.

97
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,267
I can't find it.
I can't find it.

98
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,898
My clock.
House-Father!

99
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,106
Be quiet.
Go to bed now.

100
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,539
I can't find it.

101
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,741
Help me.

102
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:43,507
Get up!

103
00:15:18,068 --> 00:15:20,024
Down, down, down!

104
00:15:20,188 --> 00:15:21,667
Let.
Let me go.

105
00:15:21,828 --> 00:15:24,581
Hand's down.
Hand's down.

106
00:15:32,828 --> 00:15:35,103
C-5.

107
00:15:39,428 --> 00:15:41,146
Thanks, House-Father.

108
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:48,858
Be quiet!

109
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,101
I see everything.

110
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,818
I hear everything.

111
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,145
Up!

112
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:50,735
"Thus began my life now
what which was just comfortable."

113
00:16:50,906 --> 00:16:53,864
"So that I occasionally,
say to myself -

114
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:58,144
- that I could just be safe
from multiple visits by the savages, -

115
00:16:58,306 --> 00:17:04,460
- so it would not bother me if I
moved from the place where I lived."

116
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:06,823
C-19.

117
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:17,501
C-19.

118
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:25,815
"I was certainly out of order
to kill a kid of my flock."

119
00:17:25,985 --> 00:17:28,374
"Carry it home and make it right."

120
00:17:28,545 --> 00:17:33,380
"But along the way, I saw a goat's
shadow with to young kids with him"

121
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:53,262
Want me to read them for you?

122
00:18:06,984 --> 00:18:09,100
C-5?

123
00:18:16,744 --> 00:18:17,858
Congratulations.

124
00:18:18,023 --> 00:18:22,255
The manager decided that you'll
sing for the committee.

125
00:18:23,023 --> 00:18:25,617
That means we must practice.

126
00:18:39,663 --> 00:18:41,699
Who is Elsa?

127
00:18:42,063 --> 00:18:43,781
Just read.

128
00:18:46,023 --> 00:18:50,460
"Dear Erling.
I'm frightened when I look beyond the ocean"

129
00:18:50,623 --> 00:18:53,262
- and think that you're out there."

130
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:57,256
"I miss you terribly now."

131
00:19:00,782 --> 00:19:02,613
Keep reading.

132
00:19:02,982 --> 00:19:07,260
" I'm trying to remember you.
How you laughed when you were last here."

133
00:19:07,422 --> 00:19:11,540
"When you didn't even know what
a harpoon was."

134
00:19:11,702 --> 00:19:15,854
Harpooner. The man which stands
in front of the boat and shoots it.

135
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,694
Was that you?

136
00:19:17,902 --> 00:19:19,893
Just continue.

137
00:19:22,182 --> 00:19:27,336
"I thought I saw you the other day.
I see you everywhere."

138
00:19:27,502 --> 00:19:31,381
"I hope you come back before christmas.
Like you promised."

139
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,171
Long before christmas.

140
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,014
Haven't you told her where you are?

141
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,771
-I think there is more.
-Read it then.

142
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,655
If you're going to be here,
you must learn to behave yourself.

143
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,652
Are you going to teach me that?

144
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,934
What have they done to you?

145
00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:52,616
Stand still.

146
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:08,899
Everything okay, C-5?

147
00:21:35,098 --> 00:21:37,009
The ear.

148
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:49,533
It doesn't look like we're
going to get rid of your smell.

149
00:21:49,698 --> 00:21:53,976
That's how it is when you're born
out of your mothers ass.

150
00:22:03,217 --> 00:22:07,130
Liquor?
Is that liquor I smell?

151
00:22:14,657 --> 00:22:16,727
Section C.

152
00:22:16,897 --> 00:22:19,206
We're going to continue
this inspection every day, -

153
00:22:19,377 --> 00:22:22,335
- until there is peace in barracks C.

154
00:22:22,497 --> 00:22:27,332
Is it funny? Then we will
find something funny for you.

155
00:23:00,816 --> 00:23:02,807
C-19.

156
00:23:03,296 --> 00:23:04,854
Stand straight!

157
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:08,646
Stand straight!

158
00:23:12,096 --> 00:23:13,654
Yes.

159
00:23:14,535 --> 00:23:17,368
This is quite meaningless,
huh?

160
00:23:19,335 --> 00:23:21,803
Just like your behavior this morning.

161
00:23:21,975 --> 00:23:23,931
I'm sorry, Sir.

162
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:26,685
No, you're not.

163
00:23:27,775 --> 00:23:32,849
It's just that I don't
belong here, manager.

164
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:40,607
Yes, you do, you see.
You belong here.

165
00:23:40,775 --> 00:23:43,243
You can put down the stone.

166
00:23:49,415 --> 00:23:55,808
Now take these stones, and place them
back in a pile where they belong.

167
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,804
So you think your strong do you?

168
00:24:18,854 --> 00:24:20,685
We will see.

169
00:24:27,214 --> 00:24:30,967
"Dear Erling,
I'm frightened when I look beyond the ocean"

170
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:33,693
- and think that you're out there."

171
00:24:33,853 --> 00:24:35,730
"I miss you..."

172
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:37,849
Erling, let him go!

173
00:25:09,492 --> 00:25:11,562
Særavdelingen.

174
00:25:12,332 --> 00:25:15,404
Forestry..
Half rations.

175
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,920
Your mother lives in Horten, right?

176
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:17,049
I thought maybe
she could invite me over.

177
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:21,408
too dinner, for example.
Maybe six or seven days?

178
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,958
Stop turning the saw, you idiot.
You'll break the blade.

179
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:46,005
That is isolation.

180
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,528
Ow, shit!

181
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:03,804
The last boy which was
put in isolation, -

182
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:08,560
- he hit his head against the wall
so he couldn't talk anymore.

183
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:18,241
-Have you never tried to run away?
-Yea. One time.

184
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:23,085
I jumped on the mail boat,
but I was only eleven.

185
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:26,487
What'd you do when you were eleven,
in order to come here?

186
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:29,682
I stole from a church.

187
00:27:33,129 --> 00:27:36,962
Help me to write a letter.
A story.

188
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:39,921
To whom?

189
00:27:42,808 --> 00:27:44,241
Somebody.

190
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:46,727
About what?

191
00:27:47,368 --> 00:27:52,237
A story of the sea.
Sailors on a ship. With me on board.

192
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,078
Did you see the whale?

193
00:28:01,248 --> 00:28:06,322
I saw a whale swim
with three harpoons in it.

194
00:28:06,488 --> 00:28:08,877
It took an entire day to die.

195
00:28:17,887 --> 00:28:19,923
What should I be then?

196
00:28:20,647 --> 00:28:22,399
Deck boy....

197
00:28:23,007 --> 00:28:26,079
And I will be the harpooner.

198
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:17,234
You shouldn't eat that.

199
00:29:17,406 --> 00:29:19,078
You'll get sick.

200
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:38,803
Sir.
We've learned.

201
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:42,116
And what have we learned?

202
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:46,477
That we're all on the same ship,
Sir.

203
00:30:02,645 --> 00:30:06,193
Give me your rabbit, Aksel.
I'm hungry, I need more food.

204
00:30:06,364 --> 00:30:08,320
Stay away!

205
00:30:08,484 --> 00:30:10,839
-I just want to pet him.
-Stay away.

206
00:30:11,004 --> 00:30:13,313
I'm just going to pet him.

207
00:30:13,684 --> 00:30:16,244
It's a her, not a him!

208
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:35,637
C-9 and C-19
requesting permission to use the outhouse.

209
00:30:56,003 --> 00:30:58,597
C-19 is a problem.
We should be harder.

210
00:30:58,883 --> 00:31:01,920
They should punish him more,
and keep him separate.

211
00:31:02,203 --> 00:31:06,242
Discipline without compassion
is heartless, we've talked about this.

212
00:31:06,443 --> 00:31:10,994
We are role models for these boys,
we must not be heartless.

213
00:31:11,163 --> 00:31:13,233
Sir.

214
00:31:13,403 --> 00:31:17,520
Now I speak not only for myself,
I have really nothing to complain about.

215
00:31:17,682 --> 00:31:20,196
I have been here for 9 years.

216
00:31:20,362 --> 00:31:23,081
I havent asked for a penny
more in pay, but ...

217
00:31:23,242 --> 00:31:25,710
The parliament church and
School Committee sets the salary.

218
00:31:25,882 --> 00:31:28,271
You have to talk to them.

219
00:31:29,362 --> 00:31:30,761
I know that, but ...

220
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:36,042
To be a house-father is important,
but it is no lifetime job.

221
00:31:36,202 --> 00:31:41,435
An ambitious man,
would have left a long time ago.

222
00:31:42,802 --> 00:31:44,554
Good Night.

223
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:47,394
Bråthen?

224
00:31:49,082 --> 00:31:53,553
Bråthen, you're doing a great job.
Good night.

225
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,474
We need help to bring in the wheat.

226
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,040
You're doing the laundry.

227
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,637
Please, let me help you
in the field. Please.

228
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,237
-Can you handle a pitchfork?
-Yes.

229
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,913
Come on!

230
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,473
Come on!

231
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,830
Where did you hide the saw blade?

232
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,195
They won't find it.

233
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,920
Promise me that you wont escape before
I leave?

234
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,274
Yes.

235
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,591
It's not long from now.

236
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,354
Hey, what are you looking at?

237
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,636
Bastøy Boy.

238
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,558
Here you are.

239
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,472
C-5?

240
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,637
C-5?

241
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,997
Let me see your hand.
Come here.

242
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:45,232
They're wrapping it together.

243
00:34:35,677 --> 00:34:37,508
What is it?

244
00:34:48,197 --> 00:34:50,586
Turn on the lights!

245
00:34:56,877 --> 00:34:58,833
Get help! Hurry!

246
00:35:33,356 --> 00:35:37,065
Come on.
Come on, we gotta leave now.

247
00:35:37,356 --> 00:35:39,823
We're leaving now.
Do you want to stay here?

248
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:44,389
Do you want to stay here?

249
00:36:39,194 --> 00:36:41,628
Go back to the infirmary, Ivar.

250
00:36:41,794 --> 00:36:43,591
Take me with, Erling.
Please, I'm begging you.

251
00:36:43,754 --> 00:36:44,664
Go!

252
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:48,986
I want to come, I can
help you row when you're tired.

253
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:51,226
Please!

254
00:36:53,873 --> 00:36:57,946
I don't want to be here anymore,
I can't do it!

255
00:36:59,113 --> 00:37:01,547
Please, Erling.

256
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,864
Please!

257
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:06,543
Go back, Ivar.

258
00:37:06,913 --> 00:37:10,223
I can't have a wussy with me..

259
00:37:40,512 --> 00:37:43,310
What?
You're not in the infirmary?

260
00:37:47,752 --> 00:37:49,105
Where have you been?

261
00:37:49,272 --> 00:37:52,150
I have been talking to someone.

262
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:54,985
Have you been down to the beach?

263
00:37:55,152 --> 00:37:57,746
Have you been with C-19?

264
00:39:26,669 --> 00:39:28,705
Gossip pussy!

265
00:39:46,709 --> 00:39:48,062
Bråthen?

266
00:39:48,229 --> 00:39:49,344
Yes, Sir?

267
00:39:49,509 --> 00:39:52,660
How long have you been on Bastøy?

268
00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:55,218
-9 years
-9 years .. .

269
00:39:55,629 --> 00:39:58,461
Has anyone managed to escape
during that time?

270
00:39:58,628 --> 00:40:01,506
-No.

271
00:40:03,628 --> 00:40:06,461
So this boy, C-19, -

272
00:40:07,548 --> 00:40:09,300
- has to be a kind of hero.

273
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:12,428
The first to successfully
escape Bastøy.

274
00:40:12,588 --> 00:40:17,025
But he is no hero.
He is selfish, egotistical and cowardly.

275
00:40:17,188 --> 00:40:19,861
He can not see himself in the face
and stand for what he has done, -

276
00:40:20,028 --> 00:40:22,337
-so he runs away.

277
00:40:24,108 --> 00:40:26,986
And leaves you all again
to take the consequences.

278
00:40:27,148 --> 00:40:32,859
He risked your privileges,
which you have worked so hard for.

279
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:38,618
And where does he run to?

280
00:40:38,787 --> 00:40:42,177
What will he find
when he finally stops running?

281
00:40:42,347 --> 00:40:45,145
He will find nothing.

282
00:40:45,347 --> 00:40:47,303
Nothing!

283
00:40:49,467 --> 00:40:56,100
For he will be taken and sent right
back here. I can promise you that.

284
00:40:56,267 --> 00:40:58,258
Am I disappointed?

285
00:40:59,227 --> 00:41:01,695
Yes, I'm.

286
00:41:02,147 --> 00:41:03,944
I disappointed in you.

287
00:41:04,107 --> 00:41:06,621
I am disappointed in C-1,
Olav Fossen, -

288
00:41:06,787 --> 00:41:08,618
- whom is responsible
for barracks C.

289
00:41:08,787 --> 00:41:13,814
But those who really
should be disappointed, are you.

290
00:41:13,986 --> 00:41:16,102
Half rations.

291
00:41:41,226 --> 00:41:46,619
He did it.
He got away.

292
00:41:46,786 --> 00:41:48,458
Erling escaped, for heavens sake!

293
00:41:48,626 --> 00:41:52,618
I heard that the chef had talked
with the captain of the mail boat

294
00:41:52,785 --> 00:41:56,460
He said he had found the manager's
rowboat across the mountains -

295
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:58,980
- by Rørestrand.

296
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:04,819
... with an Our Father in covenant

297
00:42:05,265 --> 00:42:09,656
If you never shudder

298
00:42:10,545 --> 00:42:15,300
Fight for everything you hold dear

299
00:42:15,785 --> 00:42:20,461
Die as it comes!

300
00:42:30,264 --> 00:42:31,743
C-5.

301
00:43:13,303 --> 00:43:15,259
The hero is back.

302
00:43:31,223 --> 00:43:33,691
Come on, let's work.

303
00:44:05,022 --> 00:44:09,857
C-1 will read this,
and then carry out the punishment.

304
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:15,455
Read.

305
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,336
"Penalties for serious offenses
such as escape attempt, theft -

306
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,014
- Or repeated use of tobacco, -

307
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:30,051
- Shall receive 12 strokes to
the back or until the blood seems."

308
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,497
Hands on the table!

309
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,735
Yes, between the lines.

310
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,939
Do it!

311
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:53,421
C-1, do it properly!

312
00:45:39,939 --> 00:45:43,568
Where are you going now?
Managers galley boy.

313
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:45,377
Don't blame me that you
broke the rules.

314
00:45:45,539 --> 00:45:47,609
Was it easier for you to read me the
rules, than to tell the manager -

315
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:51,613
- what Bråthen does with Ivar
in the laundry room?

316
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,369
- Or are the rules like that too?

317
00:46:02,539 --> 00:46:04,848
You promised me, you devil!

318
00:46:12,338 --> 00:46:17,856
Or do you dare not say anything, now that
you are about to get your signature?

319
00:47:22,897 --> 00:47:25,171
What is going on?
What are you doing here?

320
00:47:25,336 --> 00:47:26,928
-House-Father . ..
-Be quiet!

321
00:47:27,096 --> 00:47:28,609
You are so close to being released, -

322
00:47:28,776 --> 00:47:31,131
- and you come running in here
without permission.

323
00:47:31,296 --> 00:47:33,207
Have you lost your mind?

324
00:47:36,296 --> 00:47:38,571
I saw C-5 and ...

325
00:47:39,616 --> 00:47:41,493
.. . and ...

326
00:47:43,016 --> 00:47:45,484
... House-Father Bråthen in ...

327
00:47:45,656 --> 00:47:48,045
Bråthen?
What is he doing?

328
00:47:48,216 --> 00:47:49,695
He puts C-5 in pain.

329
00:47:50,176 --> 00:47:51,928
Pain?

330
00:47:57,656 --> 00:47:59,886
Well, speak up!

331
00:48:00,056 --> 00:48:02,250
House-Father Bråthen -

332
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,007
- and C-5 .. .

333
00:48:06,055 --> 00:48:09,092
I saw them in the laundry cellar.

334
00:48:18,735 --> 00:48:24,605
What are you trying to say?
What are these hideous fantasies?

335
00:48:24,855 --> 00:48:28,689
It's not allowed!
What he does with Ivar in the laundry cellar.

336
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:31,764
Get out!
Go!

337
00:48:52,854 --> 00:48:55,129
Ivar! I want you and I to
go to the manager right now.

338
00:48:55,294 --> 00:48:57,205
Do you not see that I'm working?

339
00:48:57,374 --> 00:49:01,652
If we go together,
he will believe us.

340
00:49:02,494 --> 00:49:05,531
Then I'll never go home.

341
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:25,288
C-5.

342
00:49:25,453 --> 00:49:26,966
Sir.

343
00:49:31,773 --> 00:49:33,411
Stand straight.

344
00:49:34,693 --> 00:49:37,412
I am just wondering -

345
00:49:39,133 --> 00:49:40,771
- if your hand is better?

346
00:49:40,933 --> 00:49:44,084
Yea, it's a little better.

347
00:49:44,573 --> 00:49:46,131
Thanks, manager.

348
00:49:46,373 --> 00:49:49,126
Good.
Then everything is okay.

349
00:49:50,573 --> 00:49:52,403
Excellent.

350
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,005
Nothing to complain about.

351
00:49:57,812 --> 00:49:59,609
But there are no other problems?

352
00:49:59,772 --> 00:50:01,364
No.

353
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:05,688
No, because I thought you should maybe ...

354
00:50:05,852 --> 00:50:08,241
I believe it will be better for you,
if you work in the forest -

355
00:50:08,412 --> 00:50:10,164
- with you friends.

356
00:50:10,332 --> 00:50:12,209
Thanks, manager.

357
00:50:12,692 --> 00:50:17,482
Yea, I believe that
the forest will better suit you.

358
00:50:18,132 --> 00:50:19,451
Yes, manager.

359
00:50:20,052 --> 00:50:23,442
Great, then!
Good.

360
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:51,924
You owe me money.

361
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,286
What money?

362
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:59,444
Bråthen and I
are having a bet.

363
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:05,408
If you are back in
laundry in the morning.

364
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:08,721
Go and help Bjarne with the fire.

365
00:51:51,689 --> 00:51:53,725
What are you doing with Ivar's clock?

366
00:51:53,889 --> 00:51:55,845
He gave it to me.

367
00:53:28,647 --> 00:53:29,875
Get back!

368
00:53:33,527 --> 00:53:36,802
Get the nurse now.
Right away!

369
00:53:37,566 --> 00:53:39,443
Run!

370
00:53:44,446 --> 00:53:46,641
Get them to the sleeping hall.

371
00:54:04,966 --> 00:54:07,036
To the sleeping hall.

372
00:54:11,926 --> 00:54:14,439
Go to the sleeping hall!

373
00:55:02,764 --> 00:55:06,518
It is absolutely terrible
what has happened.

374
00:55:06,684 --> 00:55:11,235
We suffer from everything that has happened
with the poor boy.

375
00:55:11,404 --> 00:55:14,760
I understand that you feel guilty.

376
00:55:20,324 --> 00:55:24,476
But I have to admit that he didn't
have it so easy before he came here.

377
00:55:24,644 --> 00:55:27,919
And it was no less turbulent here.

378
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:30,153
He was not as strong.

379
00:55:30,643 --> 00:55:35,671
He was one of those whom did not fit
to live among other people.

380
00:55:35,843 --> 00:55:39,995
And maybe it was God's will
that he finally let go.

381
00:55:40,163 --> 00:55:45,635
We tried to help him,
and find easy work for him.

382
00:55:46,563 --> 00:55:48,519
But -

383
00:55:49,203 --> 00:55:51,956
- he tried to swim away from here, -

384
00:55:52,123 --> 00:55:57,641
- a desperate act
that could only end in disaster.

385
00:55:57,803 --> 00:56:01,921
And we all know
where he got the idea from to flee.

386
00:56:05,842 --> 00:56:08,436
Escape is just -

387
00:56:08,602 --> 00:56:11,355
- a childish fantasy.

388
00:56:13,082 --> 00:56:15,676
But he is in peace now.

389
00:56:15,842 --> 00:56:18,402
He is in God's place.

390
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,712
Sit down.

391
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,709
C-19, sit down!

392
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:17,794
Send C-19 to my room.

393
00:58:21,399 --> 00:58:24,118
Are you looking to go to prison?

394
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:31,238
If you can't decide,
then you don't understand what a prison is.

395
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:34,396
He didn't try to escape.
He drowned himself.

396
00:58:34,598 --> 00:58:37,874
What's the difference? He's gone.
Forget him!

397
00:58:38,038 --> 00:58:41,348
And help the others to forget him also.

398
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:45,108
You've seen little of the world and you think
you understand. But you don't.

399
00:58:45,638 --> 00:58:49,472
No, manager,
there is a lot I don't understand.

400
00:58:49,878 --> 00:58:54,952
Bastøy or prison. The choice is yours.
Get him out.

401
00:59:17,357 --> 00:59:21,430
Why have you been here so long,
Bråthen?

402
00:59:25,397 --> 00:59:27,433
They talk.

403
00:59:27,757 --> 00:59:31,432
There are rumors that I don't even
want to speak about. Accusations.

404
00:59:31,757 --> 00:59:36,114
You can't listen to them,
They say whatever they want.

405
00:59:37,197 --> 00:59:39,392
A child has died.

406
00:59:39,557 --> 00:59:44,426
And you have been accused of actions
which are so horrible .. .

407
00:59:44,597 --> 00:59:46,826
The only thing I have done -

408
00:59:46,996 --> 00:59:49,988
- is to try to help a boy
who could not help himself.

409
00:59:50,276 --> 00:59:53,154
C-5 was not scared of me.

410
00:59:53,316 --> 00:59:57,867
It was these animals
he lived with in barracks C.

411
00:59:58,756 --> 01:00:04,547
I can't have a house-father
who is suspected of such a thing as this.

412
01:00:07,156 --> 01:00:09,306
It's disgusting.

413
01:00:14,916 --> 01:00:16,747
Sir.

414
01:00:17,836 --> 01:00:19,030
Please...

415
01:00:19,276 --> 01:00:24,986
You are accused of fornication with a child.
Do you understand what that means?

416
01:00:25,915 --> 01:00:27,985
Is there much truth there, -

417
01:00:28,155 --> 01:00:31,830
- shall I see that you rot away in
a prison for the rest of your life.

418
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:37,945
I understand how difficult
a man of your position must have it.

419
01:00:38,475 --> 01:00:40,943
With a young wife here.

420
01:00:41,635 --> 01:00:43,751
And all the responsibility.

421
01:00:43,915 --> 01:00:46,270
And all these options to take.

422
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:51,634
And the funds that would get the boys
and the island destroyed for good.

423
01:00:51,835 --> 01:00:56,989
The funds you've used up
to make your life a little easier.

424
01:00:57,155 --> 01:00:59,589
I know that.

425
01:01:00,595 --> 01:01:04,223
But others could maybe misunderstand it.

426
01:01:34,154 --> 01:01:36,668
Now you're leaving!
You bastard!

427
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:40,826
Leave, you bastard!

428
01:01:52,353 --> 01:01:54,389
Now it's too late.

429
01:01:59,153 --> 01:02:03,704
What are you going to say when the committee comes?
When they begin to ask questions.

430
01:02:03,873 --> 01:02:08,071
They will certainly
question and dig.

431
01:02:08,873 --> 01:02:10,670
You have to tell them the truth.

432
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:14,428
You don't give up, Astrid.
You don't give up.

433
01:02:29,592 --> 01:02:33,028
-Are you Erling Kaspersen?
-I am C-19, mam.

434
01:02:33,192 --> 01:02:35,581
Have you learned anything here?

435
01:02:36,592 --> 01:02:40,665
-Yes, mam, I have learned many things.
-Could you tell me what kind of things?

436
01:02:40,832 --> 01:02:42,902
I learned that I would rather
be here than in prison.

437
01:02:43,072 --> 01:02:44,903
And why is that?

438
01:02:45,912 --> 01:02:49,746
Don't you see
what great good we get, mam?

439
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:09,902
The boys,
are they always so quiet at the table?

440
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:11,550
No.

441
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:15,590
You see them now as they will be seen.
Clean and neat.

442
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,549
Especially the boys
who may be out in society.

443
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:22,670
For them, this is more of great importance.

444
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:28,350
The boy that died recently.
It must have made an impression on them?

445
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:32,219
I'm the first to recognize that
it isn't easy being a BastøyBoy.

446
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:34,585
It's a brutal environment.

447
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:37,742
We do what we can.
We help and we support them.

448
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:40,583
But one can not
be everywhere all the time.

449
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:44,106
And children could be very bad.

450
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:49,109
The boy who tried to escape
turned out to be a chop chicken.

451
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:52,660
He was not strong enough
to take care of himself.

452
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:55,060
Yea, it is tragic.

453
01:03:55,270 --> 01:04:00,469
"If we confess our sins,
He is faithful and just."

454
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:07,467
"So, he forgive us our sins
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."

455
01:04:07,709 --> 01:04:11,941
"What hurts is when it is. .."

456
01:04:27,829 --> 01:04:32,141
"If we confess our sins,
He is faithful and just."

457
01:04:32,309 --> 01:04:34,265
Nervous?

458
01:04:35,069 --> 01:04:41,144
"So, he forgive us our sins
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."

459
01:04:41,909 --> 01:04:45,025
Good.
Congratulations.

460
01:04:46,668 --> 01:04:48,465
Do you have something you want to say to us?

461
01:04:48,628 --> 01:04:53,656
You need not be afraid,
it is only just to speak out.

462
01:04:54,908 --> 01:04:57,581
Yes, I want -

463
01:04:57,748 --> 01:05:00,945
- to say something to Sir.

464
01:05:06,668 --> 01:05:10,741
I will never forget
all he has done.

465
01:05:12,628 --> 01:05:15,062
I want to say something.

466
01:05:15,868 --> 01:05:19,258
There is a boy here who died on this island.

467
01:05:19,788 --> 01:05:21,664
I understand manager -

468
01:05:21,827 --> 01:05:27,060
- that you were not directly involved
in harassing this kid.

469
01:05:27,867 --> 01:05:33,817
But I'm speaking as a leader of hall C,
you had a responsibility.

470
01:05:34,947 --> 01:05:37,256
Do you understand that?

471
01:05:39,427 --> 01:05:43,739
Those were wise words, Fossen.

472
01:05:43,907 --> 01:05:47,377
You could have taken
better care of that boy.

473
01:05:47,547 --> 01:05:49,458
Yes, Sir.

474
01:06:00,746 --> 01:06:02,498
When do you leave?

475
01:06:02,666 --> 01:06:04,543
In one week.

476
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:08,980
What is it with you?

477
01:06:09,586 --> 01:06:12,054
You're going out in the world now.

478
01:06:13,106 --> 01:06:17,384
You can do what you want.
Get yourself a wife.

479
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:21,622
Do you know what the committee said?
Do you know what the manager said about us?

480
01:06:21,986 --> 01:06:24,295
Doesn't matter what they said.

481
01:06:24,466 --> 01:06:27,663
Bastøy is only
a small stone in the water.

482
01:06:34,266 --> 01:06:37,337
You can be what you want.

483
01:06:38,545 --> 01:06:43,335
You can be a priest,
you are so smart in reading rules.

484
01:06:52,185 --> 01:06:54,699
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

485
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:24,735
"We sailed for several weeks
before we saw him again."

486
01:07:24,904 --> 01:07:27,054
"Our food ran out."

487
01:07:27,224 --> 01:07:31,376
"And Øystein, the chef, was not
so much to brag about in the beginning."

488
01:07:31,544 --> 01:07:37,335
"Should have seen how thing I've become.
I can't eat anymore fish."

489
01:07:37,744 --> 01:07:41,134
"But we found the whale again,
and we came right on top of it."

490
01:07:41,304 --> 01:07:43,613
"Close than we had before."

491
01:07:43,944 --> 01:07:47,823
"He was weaker due to the harpoon
I shot him with."

492
01:07:47,984 --> 01:07:52,181
"At close range, he was great,
25 meters long at least."

493
01:07:52,343 --> 01:07:55,221
"And covered with scars
from all the battles he had fought."

494
01:07:55,743 --> 01:08:00,498
"He had already killed
the new deck boy."

495
01:08:02,063 --> 01:08:05,851
"The Captain
have a high opinion of himself."

496
01:08:06,263 --> 01:08:10,097
"But deep inside
he is a damned coward."

497
01:08:11,703 --> 01:08:15,457
"The rest of the crew
are afraid of him."

498
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:20,254
"I have become acquainted with one boy
whom is soon to sign off."

499
01:08:20,423 --> 01:08:23,335
"For six years he has worn on the ship,
He has done everything right. "

500
01:08:23,503 --> 01:08:25,812
"Now he is going home."

501
01:08:36,182 --> 01:08:40,414
Forgive us our debts,
who also have forgiven our debtors.

502
01:08:40,582 --> 01:08:44,973
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

503
01:08:45,142 --> 01:08:50,057
For thine is the kingdom,
and power and the glory forever. Amen

504
01:08:50,702 --> 01:08:52,340
Sit down.

505
01:08:56,662 --> 01:08:58,254
Sit down!

506
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:15,736
We shall now take leave of
two friends. Two good friends.

507
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,939
By tomorrow they will be out in
the world meeting -

508
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:23,140
- new sorrows, new joys,
new lessons.

509
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:38,570
Aksel Johnsen.

510
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:49,614
God bless you. And may you
take care of the opportunities he gives you.

511
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:55,372
Olav Fossen.

512
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:02,689
Go!

513
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:05,297
Olav Fossen.

514
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:06,979
Go.

515
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:09,451
Go while you can.

516
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:11,417
C-1?

517
01:10:30,979 --> 01:10:35,177
Do you have any more wise words that
you want me to take with me?

518
01:11:12,458 --> 01:11:14,255
Behave yourself, now.

519
01:11:14,418 --> 01:11:15,931
See you around.

520
01:11:35,737 --> 01:11:40,174
We never finished the story.

521
01:11:41,417 --> 01:11:45,535
Maybe I will see you again.
On a ship somewhere.

522
01:12:03,137 --> 01:12:05,605
I hear you guys are leaving

523
01:12:11,336 --> 01:12:13,054
Good luck.

524
01:12:15,896 --> 01:12:17,966
Good luck.

525
01:12:21,256 --> 01:12:24,328
C-1, towel.

526
01:12:48,575 --> 01:12:50,964
Did the manager know that
Bråthen is back?

527
01:12:51,135 --> 01:12:56,653
Of course he did. He had been in land
to shop for the manager.

528
01:15:49,490 --> 01:15:51,561
It's that simple.

529
01:15:51,970 --> 01:15:53,722
If only you had done
that you were asked, -

530
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:58,566
- had it not been a problem.
Everything had been fine.

531
01:16:02,570 --> 01:16:05,209
You damned liar!

532
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:18,405
Do you remember when you first came here?

533
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:21,681
A little brat -

534
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:27,766
- who was so afraid that he shit on himself
and peed in his pants. Every day.

535
01:16:27,930 --> 01:16:29,840
Worthless.

536
01:16:30,009 --> 01:16:33,399
Just like the whore
of a mother you had.

537
01:16:33,569 --> 01:16:36,129
And your petty criminal father.

538
01:16:36,289 --> 01:16:38,166
You were nothing.

539
01:16:38,689 --> 01:16:41,044
For six years I have struggled with you.

540
01:16:41,209 --> 01:16:44,007
And all that is of value to you, -

541
01:16:44,169 --> 01:16:46,524
- I created.

542
01:17:19,728 --> 01:17:21,480
Bjarne!

543
01:17:21,648 --> 01:17:23,764
You must help us.

544
01:17:25,568 --> 01:17:27,399
You're one of us.

545
01:17:29,568 --> 01:17:31,399
Bjarne?

546
01:17:31,688 --> 01:17:34,122
Bjarne, you are one of us!

547
01:18:24,486 --> 01:18:27,125
Øystein, eat your food.

548
01:18:30,166 --> 01:18:32,680
Come on, Øystein, you must eat.

549
01:18:39,486 --> 01:18:41,204
Are you sleeping?

550
01:18:44,806 --> 01:18:48,765
Do it.
Or freeze up.

551
01:19:05,405 --> 01:19:08,078
There was just blood everywhere.

552
01:19:08,965 --> 01:19:11,877
He swallowed them down until he died.

553
01:19:12,045 --> 01:19:16,118
Harpoon shooter,
cook and cabin boy.

554
01:19:18,525 --> 01:19:21,085
Everything, swallowed by the whale.

555
01:19:21,445 --> 01:19:25,279
And everything went back
the way it used to be.

556
01:19:25,445 --> 01:19:27,481
The captain was admiral.

557
01:19:27,645 --> 01:19:31,797
And could command a crap bowl.
And sailed to America.

558
01:19:32,125 --> 01:19:35,560
And the crew was on deck
and had their own number.

559
01:19:35,724 --> 01:19:38,602
Lined with mackerel and herring.

560
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:53,277
Olav!

561
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,477
Take his key!

562
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,518
Help!

563
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,034
Help!

564
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:35,198
Runaway!

565
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,034
Olav!

566
01:22:42,279 --> 01:22:43,155
Olav!

567
01:22:43,319 --> 01:22:44,672
Olav!

568
01:22:47,279 --> 01:22:48,758
Runaway!

569
01:23:00,959 --> 01:23:03,393
Stop!
Enough!

570
01:23:05,399 --> 01:23:07,230
-Get up.
-Enough.

571
01:23:15,919 --> 01:23:17,989
Get up!

572
01:23:29,318 --> 01:23:31,832
Back to your places.

573
01:23:44,198 --> 01:23:45,836
Back to your places!

574
01:23:53,598 --> 01:23:55,428
Back!

575
01:24:48,876 --> 01:24:50,548
Come on!

576
01:25:37,355 --> 01:25:40,028
Don't do anything dumb now, boys.

577
01:25:58,794 --> 01:26:02,992
What are you looking at?
Fucking BastøyBoy.

578
01:26:50,833 --> 01:26:52,869
Get up on the chair.

579
01:26:55,833 --> 01:26:57,903
The manager is coming!

580
01:27:58,550 --> 01:28:01,509
Let him through.

581
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:25,945
You do not belong here, either.

582
01:28:29,670 --> 01:28:32,343
Goodbye, manager!

583
01:29:30,468 --> 01:29:32,060
Let him go!

584
01:29:49,548 --> 01:29:51,937
He said we should let him burn.

585
01:29:55,748 --> 01:29:57,227
Get out!

586
01:29:57,948 --> 01:30:00,143
Get out!

587
01:30:08,707 --> 01:30:10,186
C-19.

588
01:30:12,067 --> 01:30:14,501
Are you going to kill me now?

589
01:31:30,865 --> 01:31:32,776
So?

590
01:31:33,825 --> 01:31:36,737
Can I get your signature?

591
01:32:00,064 --> 01:32:01,861
Lieutenant?

592
01:32:02,904 --> 01:32:05,976
I have to talk to someone higher up.

593
01:32:09,504 --> 01:32:11,460
I want -

594
01:32:11,624 --> 01:32:14,502
- to speak to the King of Norway.

595
01:32:21,664 --> 01:32:24,224
Tell him that it is ...

596
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:32,058
That is it the king of Bastøy.

597
01:32:43,783 --> 01:32:46,138
They're coming back!

598
01:32:46,303 --> 01:32:49,215
And there are many of them.

599
01:32:49,823 --> 01:32:52,940
Do you understand what I am saying, Olav?

600
01:33:09,903 --> 01:33:11,734
Take the paddles.

601
01:33:13,302 --> 01:33:14,530
Come on!

602
01:33:30,702 --> 01:33:32,533
Come on!

603
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:45,336
Theyre coming.

604
01:38:15,534 --> 01:38:17,570
It came over from the mainland.

605
01:38:17,734 --> 01:38:20,885
-I can't do this anymore
-The sea is frozen over.

606
01:38:21,254 --> 01:38:23,370
I can't stand it.

607
01:38:24,734 --> 01:38:26,690
We can cross over!

608
01:38:26,854 --> 01:38:29,288
I can't go on it.

609
01:39:05,453 --> 01:39:06,932
Stop!

610
01:39:20,933 --> 01:39:22,810
Stop!

611
01:40:08,890 --> 01:40:10,290
Come on!

612
01:42:27,208 --> 01:42:30,404
The letters were to my sister.

613
01:42:48,647 --> 01:42:51,241
Let me go.
Let me go ...

614
01:43:50,405 --> 01:43:51,884
Olav.

615
01:43:52,725 --> 01:43:53,999
Olav.

616
01:43:58,605 --> 01:44:00,118
Olav.

617
01:44:05,365 --> 01:44:08,437
Olav?
We are approaching Christiania.

618
01:44:09,325 --> 01:44:11,885
Bastøy, port.

619
01:44:28,524 --> 01:44:33,678
I once saw a whale swim
with three harpoons in it.

620
01:44:37,604 --> 01:44:40,676
It took the entire day to die.

621
01:44:41,204 --> 01:44:46,881
He was weaker due to the harpoon
I shot him with

622
01:44:47,284 --> 01:44:51,960
And covered with scars
from all the battles he had fought.

623
01:44:55,804 --> 01:44:58,681
I have become acquainted with one boy
whom is soon to sign off.

624
01:44:58,843 --> 01:45:02,597
For the six years he has been on the ship,
He has done everything right.

625
01:45:02,763 --> 01:45:05,994
And now, he is going home.

626
01:45:31,509 --> 01:45:33,609

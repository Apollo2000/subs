3
00:01:48,716 --> 00:01:51,818
Target is on the move.

4
00:02:09,335 --> 00:02:11,572
Target,
third floor, south corridor.

5
00:02:24,584 --> 00:02:26,954
Target moving!
Third floor! North corridor.

6
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,861
He just dropped
to the second level!

7
00:02:34,827 --> 00:02:36,997
All teams circle out and move!

8
00:03:02,488 --> 00:03:03,921
This is Air One.

9
00:03:03,923 --> 00:03:05,425
We still have no visual
on the target.

10
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:33,585
All teams push down!

11
00:03:33,587 --> 00:03:34,952
Move, move!

12
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:36,955
Don't let him get
to the extraction point!

13
00:03:40,994 --> 00:03:42,663
- Move it, move it!
- Push, push!

14
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,433
Move, move, move!

15
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:51,469
Ah!

16
00:03:51,471 --> 00:03:53,637
Fuck!

17
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:56,107
Actual to Com.
Secure for drill.

18
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:57,811
In the fucking heart.

19
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,382
Air One, you're clear to land.

20
00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:05,784
You got me.

21
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:06,888
So, what do you think?

22
00:04:07,355 --> 00:04:09,553
I think I'm fucking dead.

23
00:04:09,555 --> 00:04:14,125
Mike, this course,
nobody makes it that far.

24
00:04:14,127 --> 00:04:15,429
Don't bullshit me.

25
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,630
- Thanks for letting me use that.
- Yeah, no sweat.

26
00:04:19,632 --> 00:04:22,032
So, where the hell did you
find this place, anyway?

27
00:04:22,034 --> 00:04:24,669
During the Cold War,
they used to make cruise missiles.

28
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:27,472
I bought it for next to
nothing from Uncle Sam.

29
00:04:27,474 --> 00:04:30,741
Turned Salient Global
into a 5,000-acre Disneyland.

30
00:04:30,743 --> 00:04:33,844
You can come up with any scenario you
want here and put it to the test, bud.

31
00:04:33,846 --> 00:04:35,613
Any scenario.

32
00:04:35,615 --> 00:04:37,050
Yeah,
it's a hell of a layout.

33
00:04:37,683 --> 00:04:38,950
Hey!

34
00:04:38,952 --> 00:04:40,685
- What the fuck, asshole?
- Whoa, whoa.

35
00:04:40,687 --> 00:04:42,553
He just kicked me
down the fucking stairs.

36
00:04:42,555 --> 00:04:44,589
Well, don't stand
on the fucking stairs.

37
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:45,991
You fucking winding me up?

38
00:04:45,993 --> 00:04:47,459
Hey, you don't train
like it's real,

39
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:49,094
then you're dead when it is.

40
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:50,996
Cool it, Bruno.

41
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:52,065
We're all friends here.

42
00:04:56,702 --> 00:04:57,803
Seems like a nice guy.

43
00:04:57,805 --> 00:04:59,406
Yeah.

44
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,507
So, I went off
and bought a house,

45
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:04,743
and you bought
a small city in Virginia.

46
00:05:04,745 --> 00:05:07,915
Well, as they say,
looks can be deceiving.

47
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,584
When DOD shut down
everyone's contracting gigs

48
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:14,085
after the Blackwater shit
happened,

49
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:16,188
it crippled my business.

50
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,694
All I got keeping Salient
afloat are training contracts.

51
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,431
The word is
David Gentry's retiring...

52
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,901
and you're on the deck
to take over.

53
00:05:28,034 --> 00:05:30,534
Director of Secret Service,
huh?

54
00:05:30,536 --> 00:05:33,106
And here I just thought you missed me.

55
00:05:34,373 --> 00:05:40,077
Well, if I can get a contract for
your special ops to train here,

56
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,849
it'd finally get me
out of the red.

57
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,453
Look,
let me see what I can do.

58
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:49,753
Okay? I'll bring it up to Gentry,
or whoever the new director is.

59
00:05:49,755 --> 00:05:51,121
Hey, that's all I'm asking.

60
00:05:51,123 --> 00:05:53,026
- All right, buddy.
- Thanks, Mike.

61
00:05:56,062 --> 00:06:00,097
- Hey, when are you in DC next?
- Well, when do you need me?

62
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:02,700
I'm just saying, it'd be nice
of you to come over, you know.

63
00:06:02,702 --> 00:06:04,135
Meet the family.

64
00:06:04,137 --> 00:06:06,637
Throw on some steaks,
sit out back, tell lies.

65
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,573
Sure, I'd like that.
Just say when.

66
00:06:09,575 --> 00:06:10,644
See you, bud.

67
00:06:57,156 --> 00:06:58,226
Leah?

68
00:07:11,904 --> 00:07:14,205
- Hey, hon.
- How was the range?

69
00:07:14,207 --> 00:07:16,041
Ah, easy breezy.

70
00:07:16,043 --> 00:07:18,245
My friend Wade's
got a good thing going.

71
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:21,313
Bummed I missed Lynne.

72
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,614
How many stories
did it take this time?

73
00:07:23,616 --> 00:07:24,851
The usual four.

74
00:07:26,252 --> 00:07:27,618
You gonna take a shower?

75
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,053
No.

76
00:07:29,055 --> 00:07:30,854
No, I just washed the sheets.
I just...

77
00:07:30,856 --> 00:07:33,291
You smell like gunpowder.

78
00:07:33,293 --> 00:07:34,762
Yeah, you know you love it.

79
00:07:37,363 --> 00:07:39,099
"Modern Nursing," huh?

80
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:43,368
What, you thinking
about going back to work early?

81
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,704
I'm thinking about it.

82
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:47,772
But it's like she does
something so amazing every day,

83
00:07:47,774 --> 00:07:49,076
I don't wanna miss it.

84
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:53,243
Pretty soon we're gonna have
you around here too more, right?

85
00:07:56,216 --> 00:07:58,282
Yeah. He hasn't made
a decision yet, honey.

86
00:07:58,284 --> 00:07:59,883
If you want me to,

87
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:01,820
I will march down
to the White House

88
00:08:01,822 --> 00:08:03,253
and set Trumbull straight.

89
00:08:03,255 --> 00:08:06,224
Yeah.
Think that'll work?

90
00:08:06,226 --> 00:08:07,825
I can be pretty persuasive.

91
00:08:07,827 --> 00:08:09,596
Trust me, I know.

92
00:08:10,197 --> 00:08:12,697
Leah, we have
a good life already.

93
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:15,336
So I'm just saying, you know,
I'm not gonna get all worried about it.

94
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,241
So, how long
after this last concussion

95
00:08:24,243 --> 00:08:27,411
did the migraines
and the dizziness start?

96
00:08:27,413 --> 00:08:29,013
Pretty much right away.

97
00:08:29,015 --> 00:08:31,885
And you said
it was from a car accident?

98
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:34,952
Yeah.

99
00:08:34,954 --> 00:08:37,154
When did the insomnia start?

100
00:08:37,156 --> 00:08:39,790
Well, I've always had
a little.

101
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:42,092
Comes with the job,
I guess.

102
00:08:42,094 --> 00:08:44,162
What line of work are you in?

103
00:08:44,164 --> 00:08:45,666
Computer sales.

104
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,669
Yeah, I travel a lot.

105
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,905
Mr. Jameson, you need
to be a lot more careful.

106
00:08:54,907 --> 00:09:00,077
I'm seeing severe compression
between C3 through 5 in your neck,

107
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:02,680
possible spinal cord damage.

108
00:09:02,682 --> 00:09:05,085
You're a disaster
waiting to happen.

109
00:09:11,224 --> 00:09:12,727
Pathfinder's moving.

110
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:24,436
Just a few more of these pressers
and I'm done with this circus.

111
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,938
Ah, you know
you'll miss it, sir.

112
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,342
You have no life.

113
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:32,209
Says the man who could be taking my place.

114
00:09:32,211 --> 00:09:34,478
- Mr. President? Mr. President?
- Helen.

115
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,415
Mr. President, you promised to
amend the AUMF War Powers Resolution

116
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:40,885
to require approval
from Congress

117
00:09:40,887 --> 00:09:44,154
before committing US military
forces to further conflicts.

118
00:09:44,156 --> 00:09:46,725
- Is that still your intention?
- It is.

119
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:50,327
We've become complacent
to war in this country.

120
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:54,832
I intend to change that by making
it our last, but clear, option.

121
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:56,233
Yeah, Steve.

122
00:09:56,235 --> 00:09:58,470
Mr. President,
with Russia continuing

123
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,438
to extend its military
well beyond its borders,

124
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,809
what is your strategy to stop them
from reforming the old Soviet Union?

125
00:10:05,811 --> 00:10:08,746
Well, you'll know where I
stand on that issue at the G20.

126
00:10:08,748 --> 00:10:11,783
There are rumors in the White
House that your new foreign policy

127
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:14,752
will broaden the use
of private contractors

128
00:10:14,754 --> 00:10:18,122
to help bolster American troops,
who remain scattered around the globe.

129
00:10:18,124 --> 00:10:19,859
Is there any truth to that?

130
00:10:21,393 --> 00:10:24,194
That's all for today, folks.
Thank you very much.

131
00:10:24,196 --> 00:10:26,430
Mr. President! Mr. President!

132
00:10:26,432 --> 00:10:29,333
I swear,
these walls have more leaks

133
00:10:29,335 --> 00:10:31,839
than a submarine
with a screen door.

134
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,175
It wasn't me.

135
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:36,076
You sure?

136
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:40,377
- I'm sure.
- Okay.

137
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:44,783
...who, once again,
leaked false info to the press.

138
00:10:44,785 --> 00:10:46,153
Thank you, Sam.

139
00:10:47,554 --> 00:10:51,188
I thought I made my position clear
about private contractor companies

140
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,425
during the election.

141
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:57,861
I am tired, sick and tired,

142
00:10:57,863 --> 00:11:00,164
of a handful of people
profiting from our mission.

143
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,502
Hell, half these guys
aren't even American.

144
00:11:03,036 --> 00:11:07,373
It's not the same fighting for money
as when you fight for your flag.

145
00:11:08,108 --> 00:11:10,511
Now, enough with the leaks.
Who's talking?

146
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:15,782
Nobody's fessing up, huh?

147
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,818
Of course not.

148
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:20,818
Well, let me be clear.

149
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,287
It is not our troops' fault

150
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:24,158
that they are stretched
so thin.

151
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,391
It's our fault.

152
00:11:27,393 --> 00:11:30,327
The status quo has gone on
long enough.

153
00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:32,031
It's time
for a new way forward.

154
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:36,266
Well, I haven't done one of these for a while.

155
00:11:36,268 --> 00:11:37,901
- Oh, God.
- I forgot about that.

156
00:11:37,903 --> 00:11:39,537
What are you doing?

157
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:41,239
- You still doing this?
- Here we go.

158
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:43,043
You gotta see this, babe.
It's very funny.

159
00:11:44,074 --> 00:11:44,608
Yeah, well, I wasn't
much of a card player,

160
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,544
so I had to find a way
to spend the time.

161
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:49,279
- Mike said you grew up in England?
- Yeah, I did.

162
00:11:49,281 --> 00:11:51,882
Yeah, my father
was an expat. I...

163
00:11:51,884 --> 00:11:54,052
I never really felt
I belonged anywhere.

164
00:11:54,054 --> 00:11:56,221
But when I moved to the States
after school, I joined the army.

165
00:11:56,223 --> 00:11:58,155
And how long did you guys
serve together?

166
00:11:58,157 --> 00:12:00,390
I got into Third Batt
right after you.

167
00:12:00,392 --> 00:12:02,260
- So, what, about three, four years?
- That sounds about right. Yeah.

168
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:04,395
Mike never tells me stories
about his army days.

169
00:12:04,397 --> 00:12:05,833
Yeah, well, most of us don't.

170
00:12:07,132 --> 00:12:08,368
It's just our way, I guess.

171
00:12:08,868 --> 00:12:12,871
- But, hey, if you wanna hear a story...
- No.

172
00:12:12,873 --> 00:12:14,606
- Yeah.
- No, she doesn't wanna hear a story.

173
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,507
No, whatever he's gonna say
is definitely inappropriate.

174
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:19,276
- All right.
- Oh, God.

175
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,279
Well, army cooks aren't
exactly culinary giants.

176
00:12:22,281 --> 00:12:24,314
So we used to go
to this restaurant

177
00:12:24,316 --> 00:12:27,284
that made the best fried
chicken that you've ever had.

178
00:12:27,286 --> 00:12:29,120
And we'd eat baskets full.

179
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:33,957
And the cook,
he was this great old guy called Moe.

180
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,093
- Moe.
- Moe had to walk to work.

181
00:12:36,095 --> 00:12:39,396
Five miles to work and five miles back.
Rain or shine.

182
00:12:39,398 --> 00:12:43,534
Now, you can fry an egg on a
Georgia sidewalk in the summer.

183
00:12:43,536 --> 00:12:47,438
So Mike went to every man in the
company, with a duffel bag,

184
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,044
and asked 'em
to put some money in, or else.

185
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:53,377
Now, your husband,
he can be pretty stubborn.

186
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:55,279
Yeah, tell me about it.

187
00:12:55,281 --> 00:12:57,347
So Mike didn't quit

188
00:12:57,349 --> 00:13:00,220
until every single one of them
emptied their wallets.

189
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:03,056
And do you know
what your daddy did?

190
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:07,493
Bought Moe a car so he didn't
have to walk to work anymore.

191
00:13:08,393 --> 00:13:11,865
Mike Banning's one of the most
bullheaded men I've ever met.

192
00:13:12,498 --> 00:13:16,103
No way was he gonna let
old Moe down.

193
00:13:17,503 --> 00:13:19,270
Here.
There you go, sweetheart.

194
00:13:19,272 --> 00:13:20,974
That's for you.
Say thank you.

195
00:13:24,643 --> 00:13:25,709
Here.

196
00:13:25,711 --> 00:13:27,145
Drink that, please,

197
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:28,281
and shut up.

198
00:13:28,915 --> 00:13:31,616
Did you ever think
we'd live past 30?

199
00:13:31,618 --> 00:13:34,651
No. Not back then, anyway.

200
00:13:34,653 --> 00:13:36,055
Hell, I miss it.

201
00:13:36,555 --> 00:13:39,057
The smoking,
the joking with the guys...

202
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:41,159
the adrenaline, the fighting.

203
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,633
You okay?

204
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:49,202
Yeah.

205
00:13:51,237 --> 00:13:52,305
You sure?

206
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:55,441
Hey, can I be honest with you?

207
00:13:57,676 --> 00:14:00,647
I don't think I'm gonna take the
director's job if they offer it.

208
00:14:01,415 --> 00:14:03,581
God, I'm not ready
to ride a desk yet.

209
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,953
I saw it in your eyes
the moment I mentioned it.

210
00:14:06,485 --> 00:14:07,987
Hell, I wouldn't either.

211
00:14:10,656 --> 00:14:12,358
We're lions.

212
00:14:12,892 --> 00:14:15,462
And that ain't never
gonna change.

213
00:14:19,065 --> 00:14:20,200
Tell you what, though...

214
00:14:21,568 --> 00:14:24,401
I'll put in a good word for you
when they pick the new director.

215
00:14:24,403 --> 00:14:25,939
Only if it's convenient.

216
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,009
To Moe.

217
00:14:29,475 --> 00:14:30,543
To Moe.

218
00:15:08,147 --> 00:15:09,679
Analysts are concerned

219
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:11,182
that the buildup
of Russian forces...

220
00:15:11,184 --> 00:15:12,586
I thought
you could only fit four.

221
00:15:13,152 --> 00:15:15,022
Oh, thanks,
I do want some.

222
00:15:16,522 --> 00:15:18,289
I made some breakfast.
You want some?

223
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,757
No, babe, I gotta go.
I'll get some at the office.

224
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:22,161
Hey, you.

225
00:15:23,563 --> 00:15:25,529
Chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka.
Hey.

226
00:15:25,531 --> 00:15:26,566
I still got it.

227
00:15:28,035 --> 00:15:31,468
You look exhausted. I know you
didn't sleep again last night, and...

228
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,304
Babe... I'm okay.

229
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:35,740
Can we just talk about this
for five minutes?

230
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:37,507
- I gotta go.
- You're not that late.

231
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:41,078
I will see you
in a few days, okay?

232
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,416
We'll talk about it
when you get back.

233
00:15:42,882 --> 00:15:44,448
We'll talk about it
when I get back.

234
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,518
I promise.

235
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,094
All right, Lynnie-pin.

236
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:58,162
- Can you say bye-bye?
- Bye, Lynnie-pin.

237
00:15:58,164 --> 00:15:59,700
Ah, ooh, good!

238
00:16:03,368 --> 00:16:05,669
We're all set, Sector One.

239
00:16:05,671 --> 00:16:07,270
All clear, Sector Two.

240
00:16:07,272 --> 00:16:08,508
Pathfinder inbound.

241
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:15,482
All units be
advised, Pathfinder Alpha.

242
00:16:17,282 --> 00:16:19,683
Command post,
get your middle perimeter all clear.

243
00:16:19,685 --> 00:16:22,819
- Right, man.
- I'll be in with a few beers tonight.

244
00:16:22,821 --> 00:16:24,889
But that's it. Starting today,
you're buying everything.

245
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:27,361
Command post mid,
inner perimeter all clear.

246
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:30,160
Command post
advised: The outer, middle

247
00:16:30,162 --> 00:16:31,764
and inner perimeters
all clear.

248
00:16:32,498 --> 00:16:33,800
Banning copies.

249
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:39,537
You must really like
fishing, sir.

250
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:41,805
It's cold as shit out here.

251
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:43,076
Sorry.

252
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,214
Anything to get out of DC
for a while.

253
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,519
Just don't know
who to trust anymore.

254
00:16:54,621 --> 00:16:55,686
Anyhoo.

255
00:16:55,688 --> 00:16:57,420
Whose idea was it

256
00:16:57,422 --> 00:16:59,590
for you to throw your hat
in the ring for director,

257
00:16:59,592 --> 00:17:00,824
yours or Leah's?

258
00:17:00,826 --> 00:17:02,762
- Oh, mine, sir.
- Hmm.

259
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,199
Well, for her.

260
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:07,733
For me too.

261
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:13,236
It was... mine too.

262
00:17:13,238 --> 00:17:14,708
Don't think I've ever
seen you so nervous.

263
00:17:17,943 --> 00:17:20,311
Look, sir, if I'm not the...

264
00:17:20,313 --> 00:17:23,684
I think it's a great idea for
you to pick up the torch, Mike.

265
00:17:24,816 --> 00:17:26,516
So...

266
00:17:26,518 --> 00:17:28,822
I am selecting you
for director.

267
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,159
Congratulations.

268
00:17:34,861 --> 00:17:36,897
I'll... I'll give it
my best shot, sir.

269
00:17:37,497 --> 00:17:39,333
Thank you.

270
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:41,535
That's what I was afraid of.

271
00:17:42,268 --> 00:17:44,701
- What's that, sir?
- That look in your eye.

272
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,839
Like I just handed you
a death sentence.

273
00:17:50,677 --> 00:17:54,911
Oh, if I had my way, sir, I would
keep hard-charging to the day I die.

274
00:17:54,913 --> 00:17:56,849
But that's not realistic.

275
00:17:59,585 --> 00:18:00,820
Give it a few days.

276
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:05,192
Talk it over with Leah,
and we'll go from there. Okay?

277
00:18:05,624 --> 00:18:07,193
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

278
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:14,267
Hey. Hey!

279
00:18:14,834 --> 00:18:16,236
You all right?

280
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:19,536
I just need to rehydrate.

281
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:20,938
Why don't you get somebody
to cover for you?

282
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,974
No, sir. I'm good. I'm okay.

283
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:26,246
Mike... I'm fine.

284
00:18:26,746 --> 00:18:29,550
Go.
You're scaring my damn fish.

285
00:18:31,517 --> 00:18:32,719
They're frozen, anyway.

286
00:18:33,352 --> 00:18:35,585
Go. Smart-ass.

287
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:36,822
Murph, it's Banning.

288
00:18:38,024 --> 00:18:39,957
Hey, can you give me a push?

289
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:41,592
Roger. I'm on my way.

290
00:19:09,555 --> 00:19:10,791
Banning's on his way.

291
00:19:11,423 --> 00:19:13,426
Come in...

292
00:19:48,995 --> 00:19:52,366
What is that? Are they bats?

293
00:20:12,951 --> 00:20:14,618
Drones! They're drones!

294
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,086
- Murph...
- Come with me, sir.

295
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:17,755
...get him under
the ballistic hard cover

296
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:18,889
and keep him down.
I'm on my way.

297
00:20:26,498 --> 00:20:28,535
Delta Team, engage. Engage.

298
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:43,113
Don't move. Don't move.
They're tracking us somehow.

299
00:20:43,115 --> 00:20:45,983
Just hold still
and keep him covered, Murph.

300
00:20:45,985 --> 00:20:47,387
I'm coming to you.

301
00:21:02,401 --> 00:21:04,371
Move back! Take the shot!

302
00:21:10,109 --> 00:21:11,976
Bravo Team is down.
Bravo team...

303
00:21:11,978 --> 00:21:13,076
They're too small!

304
00:21:16,716 --> 00:21:17,950
Backup team,
move to Pathfinder.

305
00:21:27,459 --> 00:21:28,795
Open fire! Open fire!

306
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,833
- Shoot those motherfuckers!
- There's too many!

307
00:22:02,094 --> 00:22:03,630
Get down!

308
00:22:23,748 --> 00:22:24,785
Fuck!

309
00:22:26,719 --> 00:22:27,953
Oh, my God.

310
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,261
They're coming at you, Murph.
Get him in the water.

311
00:22:37,263 --> 00:22:38,696
The hard cover isn't enough.

312
00:22:38,698 --> 00:22:39,900
- What about you?
- Go!

313
00:22:57,517 --> 00:22:58,785
Sir, I got you.

314
00:23:02,121 --> 00:23:04,591
Okay, sir, we're going under.
Dive deep.

315
00:23:13,598 --> 00:23:15,733
We're getting disturbing reports

316
00:23:15,735 --> 00:23:17,967
that there's been an assassination
attempt on the president.

317
00:23:17,969 --> 00:23:20,905
We're getting
reports of a drone strike.

318
00:23:20,907 --> 00:23:22,676
A backup Marine One
has been called to extract the president.

319
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:28,978
Alpha 17, this is Hawk 5.

320
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,852
We are approaching Saint
Matthews with Pathfinder.

321
00:23:32,751 --> 00:23:33,886
One-fifty over 90.

322
00:23:45,264 --> 00:23:47,864
We don't have
many confirmed details yet,

323
00:23:47,866 --> 00:23:50,900
but it appears
that President Allan Trumbull

324
00:23:50,902 --> 00:23:54,004
has had an assassination
attempt on his life

325
00:23:54,006 --> 00:23:55,906
while on a fishing trip today.

326
00:23:55,908 --> 00:23:58,274
We expect to receive
more details soon,

327
00:23:58,276 --> 00:24:00,311
- including the staggering death toll...
- Oh. Come on.

328
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,282
...on his Secret Service
protection team.

329
00:24:25,036 --> 00:24:26,836
Mr. President,
can you hear me?

330
00:24:31,943 --> 00:24:33,245
Agent Banning, stay with me.

331
00:24:37,315 --> 00:24:38,651
Is everything secure?

332
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:42,218
Okay,
I want the president in Suite B,

333
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,089
and I want Banning
over here in the ward.

334
00:25:03,308 --> 00:25:05,911
Hey, Johnson.
You're coming with me. Come on.

335
00:25:07,712 --> 00:25:11,782
Peterson. Make sure HRT
has that lake secured. Got it?

336
00:25:11,784 --> 00:25:12,819
Yeah.

337
00:25:16,055 --> 00:25:18,091
Mr. Vice President, this way.

338
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,034
How is he?

339
00:25:30,036 --> 00:25:31,869
Well, he was already
in a comatose state

340
00:25:31,871 --> 00:25:33,871
when he arrived
on Marine One.

341
00:25:33,873 --> 00:25:35,773
We were told
there were heavy explosions,

342
00:25:35,775 --> 00:25:37,940
but we're not seeing
any signs

343
00:25:37,942 --> 00:25:40,209
of swelling
from traumatic brain damage,

344
00:25:40,211 --> 00:25:41,945
which is great news.

345
00:25:41,947 --> 00:25:44,117
Now it's a waiting game.

346
00:25:47,687 --> 00:25:49,122
And the security detail?

347
00:25:49,588 --> 00:25:51,156
Only one survived, sir.

348
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:56,196
Mike Banning.
The others died on scene.

349
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,199
And what's Banning's status?

350
00:26:03,201 --> 00:26:05,169
He was also unconscious
when he arrived,

351
00:26:05,171 --> 00:26:07,207
but he's already
showing signs of response.

352
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,177
We expect him to be alert soon,
and then we'll run some more tests.

353
00:26:13,211 --> 00:26:14,279
When you're ready, sir.

354
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,116
I'll need to see you
outside.

355
00:26:30,796 --> 00:26:31,831
Sir.

356
00:26:33,097 --> 00:26:36,065
This is Judge Spier of the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

357
00:26:36,067 --> 00:26:38,337
She will swear you in
as acting president.

358
00:26:42,408 --> 00:26:45,909
All right. Let's hope
this is only a formality.

359
00:26:45,911 --> 00:26:48,914
Mr. Vice President,
if you'll place your hand on the Bible...

360
00:26:49,748 --> 00:26:53,385
and raise your right hand,
and repeat after me.

361
00:26:54,152 --> 00:26:57,790
"I, Martin James Kirby,
do solemnly swear..."

362
00:26:58,423 --> 00:27:03,095
I, Martin James Kirby,
do solemnly swear...

363
00:27:03,796 --> 00:27:05,795
"that I will
faithfully execute

364
00:27:05,797 --> 00:27:08,334
the office of president
of the United States..."

365
00:27:09,067 --> 00:27:11,235
that I will
faithfully execute

366
00:27:11,237 --> 00:27:13,907
the office of president
of the United States...

367
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,810
"and will
to the best of my ability..."

368
00:27:17,276 --> 00:27:20,110
and will
to the best of my ability...

369
00:27:20,112 --> 00:27:24,784
"preserve, protect and defend
the Constitution of the United States."

370
00:27:27,253 --> 00:27:32,959
preserve, protect and defend the
Constitution of the United States.

371
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:36,062
- "So help me God."
- So help me God.

372
00:27:40,165 --> 00:27:41,200
Ramirez.

373
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:44,534
All right. Hold, hold.

374
00:27:44,536 --> 00:27:46,169
Local police found a van

375
00:27:46,171 --> 00:27:47,938
a mile to the north
full of electronics gear.

376
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,139
Some kind of launcher system.

377
00:27:49,141 --> 00:27:50,274
Tell 'em don't touch a thing

378
00:27:50,276 --> 00:27:51,842
until our people get there.

379
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:53,442
On it. All right,
secure the area.

380
00:27:53,444 --> 00:27:54,913
All right, let's work.

381
00:28:10,328 --> 00:28:12,329
Move there, please.
We'll check you in two at a time.

382
00:28:12,331 --> 00:28:13,900
Two forward. Let's go.

383
00:28:18,136 --> 00:28:20,269
David, thank God. Is he okay?

384
00:28:20,271 --> 00:28:21,907
He's in the ICU.

385
00:28:22,807 --> 00:28:24,877
But I'm sorry, that's all
I can tell you right now.

386
00:28:25,378 --> 00:28:28,044
- Come on.
- What? Tell me what happened to my husband, David.

387
00:28:28,046 --> 00:28:30,382
Leah, you need
to come with me. Okay?

388
00:28:31,249 --> 00:28:34,319
Come on. I'll get you a room
where you and Lynne can rest.

389
00:28:59,245 --> 00:29:00,546
Why am I in cuffs?

390
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:05,151
I'm Special Agent Helen
Thompson with the FBI.

391
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:08,254
Can you tell me your name?
Who you work for?

392
00:29:09,555 --> 00:29:12,522
My name is Mike Banning,
Secret Service.

393
00:29:12,524 --> 00:29:14,260
Where... Where am I?

394
00:29:15,594 --> 00:29:17,095
And why am I being secured?

395
00:29:18,296 --> 00:29:20,197
You're in
Saint Matthews Hospital.

396
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:22,032
You remember
how you got here?

397
00:29:22,034 --> 00:29:25,134
Just tell me
what the fuck is going on.

398
00:29:25,136 --> 00:29:27,840
- What's the last thing you remember?
- Oh.

399
00:29:28,507 --> 00:29:31,411
Mike, it's very important you tell
me the last thing you remember.

400
00:29:38,182 --> 00:29:39,219
Murph.

401
00:29:41,085 --> 00:29:42,188
The president.

402
00:29:43,189 --> 00:29:45,291
Where's the president?
Where is he? Is he okay?

403
00:29:48,026 --> 00:29:50,963
President Trumbull is in a coma,
and your whole team is dead.

404
00:29:54,098 --> 00:29:55,234
Except you.

405
00:29:56,401 --> 00:29:58,171
Tell me how that happened.

406
00:30:00,005 --> 00:30:02,642
- What happened on the lake?
- I need to see the president.

407
00:30:03,709 --> 00:30:05,344
I need to see
the president now.

408
00:30:06,045 --> 00:30:08,711
- Not gonna happen.
- I've been sitting here for hours.

409
00:30:08,713 --> 00:30:11,948
No one's telling me what's going on.
My husband's in the ICU...

410
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,216
Leah, I know this is
frustrating for you.

411
00:30:13,218 --> 00:30:15,151
I'd like my daughter
in here, please.

412
00:30:15,153 --> 00:30:16,687
But I think it's best that
we just let Lynne sleep, okay?

413
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,220
I wanna see my husband.

414
00:30:18,222 --> 00:30:19,555
And I'm working on that
for you.

415
00:30:19,557 --> 00:30:21,193
But first...

416
00:30:21,794 --> 00:30:24,964
did you know about the $10
million in the offshore account?

417
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:28,198
- Mike's account.
- Ten million what?

418
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,104
Maybe you can explain why
I found your DNA in the van.

419
00:30:33,271 --> 00:30:35,171
Skin cells, hair.

420
00:30:35,173 --> 00:30:37,407
Right there
on the launch controls.

421
00:30:37,409 --> 00:30:38,641
What?

422
00:30:38,643 --> 00:30:40,643
Or residue
from the same explosives

423
00:30:40,645 --> 00:30:42,949
used in the event
in your garage.

424
00:30:44,382 --> 00:30:47,351
Mike, tell me about the encrypted
folder we found on the dark web.

425
00:30:47,353 --> 00:30:48,552
Encrypted folder?

426
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:50,120
The encrypted folder

427
00:30:50,122 --> 00:30:51,988
that contained
the classified map

428
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:55,425
and your Secret Service
itinerary for the lake trip.

429
00:30:55,427 --> 00:30:58,264
Only you had that, Mike.
How did that happen?

430
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:01,700
Did you know about Mike's
issues with painkillers?

431
00:31:02,802 --> 00:31:07,336
How about that he has seen four
different doctors in the last six months,

432
00:31:07,338 --> 00:31:09,372
paying each one of them
in cash?

433
00:31:09,374 --> 00:31:11,143
Did you know
about that issue?

434
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:16,079
The controls were left on auto to deploy
the drones during the trip's window.

435
00:31:16,081 --> 00:31:19,248
The facial recognition to target
the president of the United States,

436
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,419
as well as every member
of your team, except you.

437
00:31:22,421 --> 00:31:24,621
You had this perfectly
planned, Mike, didn't you?

438
00:31:24,623 --> 00:31:27,189
Can't you see
that I'm being set up?

439
00:31:27,191 --> 00:31:28,758
No, I cannot, Agent Banning.

440
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,294
He's in line to be director
of the Secret Service.

441
00:31:32,296 --> 00:31:35,431
Exactly. Which is why I
believe Mike saw the inevitable

442
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:37,734
and was looking for
a big payout for you guys.

443
00:31:37,736 --> 00:31:41,804
Now, if that's the case, Leah,
that means somebody paid him to do this.

444
00:31:41,806 --> 00:31:47,113
If you can help me find that person,
it would help Mike's case considerably.

445
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:52,351
Fuck you, lady.

446
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,320
You can't play me.

447
00:31:55,653 --> 00:31:57,720
My husband is a good man.

448
00:31:57,722 --> 00:31:59,723
You're being charged
with the attempted murder

449
00:31:59,725 --> 00:32:01,725
of the president
of the United States,

450
00:32:01,727 --> 00:32:05,594
as well as the premeditated
murder of your entire team.

451
00:32:05,596 --> 00:32:07,663
No, no, no, wait. Wait.

452
00:32:07,665 --> 00:32:10,233
Get the president.
He'll tell you the truth.

453
00:32:10,235 --> 00:32:12,502
There's somebody else behind this.
It wasn't me.

454
00:32:12,504 --> 00:32:15,639
We're transporting you to a
protected location for arraignment

455
00:32:15,641 --> 00:32:17,343
once you're cleared
by the doctors.

456
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,446
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

457
00:32:37,662 --> 00:32:41,163
President Trumbull's
top guardian angel has fallen tonight.

458
00:32:41,165 --> 00:32:43,867
Secret Service Agent Mike
Banning has been arrested...

459
00:32:43,869 --> 00:32:46,769
Shocking revelations of
betrayal in President Trumbull's own team.

460
00:32:46,771 --> 00:32:49,171
Banning,
who was rumored to be in line

461
00:32:49,173 --> 00:32:52,508
to be the next Secret Service
director, was the mastermind...

462
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,544
Mike
Banning has been arrested...

463
00:32:54,546 --> 00:32:56,412
Agent
Banning, why did you do this?

464
00:32:56,414 --> 00:32:58,482
...assassination attempt...

465
00:32:58,484 --> 00:32:59,783
Secret Service
Agent Mike Banning...

466
00:32:59,785 --> 00:33:01,418
Mr. Banning! Mr. Banning,

467
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,519
is there any truth
to the allegations?

468
00:33:03,521 --> 00:33:05,223
...and many
of his protection detail dead.

469
00:33:30,716 --> 00:33:34,184
Mrs. Banning, why did your husband do it?

470
00:33:34,186 --> 00:33:36,585
- Mrs. Banning.
- Mrs. Banning, can we get a statement?

471
00:33:36,587 --> 00:33:39,424
Can we get a statement,
Mrs. Banning? How much did you know?

472
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,661
Thompson.

473
00:33:43,495 --> 00:33:45,164
She just got home.

474
00:33:45,796 --> 00:33:47,496
Put a car outside.

475
00:33:47,498 --> 00:33:49,299
She's not in on this.

476
00:33:49,301 --> 00:33:50,600
Phones are tapped,
so we'll give Banning

477
00:33:50,602 --> 00:33:51,668
some rope to hang himself.

478
00:34:01,846 --> 00:34:04,150
Hey! Wake the fuck up.

479
00:34:04,616 --> 00:34:06,850
You're never sleeping again,
motherfucker.

480
00:34:06,852 --> 00:34:09,886
Leave him alone, man.
You don't even know if he really did it.

481
00:34:09,888 --> 00:34:11,788
The hell he didn't.

482
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,694
Trumbull was just starting
to turn things around, too.

483
00:34:40,252 --> 00:34:42,219
I'm into
all three motherboards.

484
00:34:42,221 --> 00:34:45,257
Pulling their chains
in three, two, one.

485
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:49,528
What the...

486
00:34:52,864 --> 00:34:54,367
Thing just went dead.

487
00:35:03,709 --> 00:35:06,511
Shit. Look.
The escort vehicles, too.

488
00:35:08,446 --> 00:35:09,748
This ain't good, man.

489
00:35:13,384 --> 00:35:14,386
Call it in.

490
00:35:15,353 --> 00:35:16,453
How? The radio's...

491
00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:18,623
Shit!

492
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,596
Ah!

493
00:35:32,904 --> 00:35:34,440
What do we do? What do we do?

494
00:35:35,373 --> 00:35:36,908
Hey! Hey!

495
00:35:38,676 --> 00:35:39,711
Fuck!

496
00:35:47,352 --> 00:35:48,520
No, no. No, wait.

497
00:35:49,288 --> 00:35:50,356
Move!

498
00:36:10,908 --> 00:36:12,744
Get out of the van.

499
00:36:13,277 --> 00:36:16,679
Get out of there! Get out!
Move! Move!

500
00:36:16,681 --> 00:36:17,946
Fucking move!

501
00:36:17,948 --> 00:36:19,884
Fucking move! Move it!

502
00:36:22,553 --> 00:36:24,623
Get on with it! Move!

503
00:36:25,656 --> 00:36:27,892
Get the fuck in. Get in!

504
00:36:45,076 --> 00:36:46,578
We're three minutes out.

505
00:36:47,846 --> 00:36:49,015
Standing by.

506
00:36:57,723 --> 00:36:59,558
So who are you guys anyway?

507
00:37:03,694 --> 00:37:05,463
- Stop!
- Get him! Get him!

508
00:37:12,904 --> 00:37:14,002
Get him off me!

509
00:37:14,004 --> 00:37:15,073
Grab him! Grab him!

510
00:37:16,707 --> 00:37:18,376
He got my gun!

511
00:37:23,915 --> 00:37:26,052
Shit.

512
00:39:02,547 --> 00:39:04,417
Hey. What the fuck, asshole?

513
00:39:05,649 --> 00:39:07,786
He just kicked me down
the fucking stairs.

514
00:39:12,156 --> 00:39:13,526
Fuck.

515
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,844
I told you you should've trained
like it was fucking real.

516
00:39:47,158 --> 00:39:49,926
- ...transport van...
- Oh, God.

517
00:39:49,928 --> 00:39:53,531
Restraints...
Restraint bolts were cut with bolt cutters.

518
00:39:53,998 --> 00:39:55,000
Fuck.

519
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,136
Get a wide here of the...

520
00:39:58,636 --> 00:40:00,770
- Did you get this here?
- Still piecing together what happened,

521
00:40:00,772 --> 00:40:03,940
- but Banning's gone.
- Shit, shit.

522
00:40:03,942 --> 00:40:05,308
This was no cowboy hit.

523
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,645
It was tactical.

524
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,779
Okay.

525
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:12,214
Keep the search area wide.

526
00:40:12,216 --> 00:40:14,216
Triple security
at all travel hubs

527
00:40:14,218 --> 00:40:15,685
in the surrounding areas.

528
00:40:15,687 --> 00:40:17,152
Banning is Secret Service.

529
00:40:17,154 --> 00:40:19,288
He knows how we do this.
He knows all our tricks.

530
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:21,723
I want every surveillance
camera in the nation

531
00:40:21,725 --> 00:40:23,592
going through
our facial recognition system.

532
00:40:23,594 --> 00:40:25,594
Anything we see,
I want it followed up.

533
00:40:25,596 --> 00:40:27,330
And I don't wanna hear anything
about a subpoena at this point,

534
00:40:27,332 --> 00:40:28,698
'cause I really don't
give a shit.

535
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,033
We will deal with that later.

536
00:40:30,035 --> 00:40:31,600
We just found
a crashed Suburban

537
00:40:31,602 --> 00:40:33,101
near the ambush
with blood inside.

538
00:40:33,103 --> 00:40:34,573
The VIN numbers
and plates were stripped.

539
00:40:35,774 --> 00:40:36,906
- I wanna know if that's Banning's blood.
- Yes, ma'am.

540
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,547
Thompson.

541
00:40:45,082 --> 00:40:46,584
Yes, sir. Thank you.

542
00:40:47,953 --> 00:40:52,091
CID traced Banning's money back
to a state-owned bank in Moscow.

543
00:40:53,892 --> 00:40:54,926
How 'bout that?

544
00:41:04,102 --> 00:41:06,669
Renegade 607 confirming.

545
00:41:06,671 --> 00:41:10,009
Falcon 904,
have you found Banning yet?

546
00:41:10,975 --> 00:41:12,210
No, but we're on it.

547
00:41:13,578 --> 00:41:15,678
We agreed to
keep Banning alive at the lake

548
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,312
so that he could
take the fall.

549
00:41:17,314 --> 00:41:18,982
Then you said you were
gonna make it look

550
00:41:18,984 --> 00:41:20,716
like his team rescued him

551
00:41:20,718 --> 00:41:22,053
and disappeared
with the 10 million.

552
00:41:24,723 --> 00:41:26,154
And now, look.

553
00:41:26,156 --> 00:41:28,056
You actually
let him get away.

554
00:41:28,058 --> 00:41:29,861
And he can expose us.

555
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,933
There's still enough evidence
to nail Mike as the mastermind.

556
00:41:35,734 --> 00:41:38,304
The FBI have already ID'd
the evidence that we planted,

557
00:41:38,837 --> 00:41:40,839
including his DNA in the van.

558
00:41:41,573 --> 00:41:44,843
As we speak, they're also
connecting him to the money trail.

559
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:48,277
So let's not start panicking
and do something foolish.

560
00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:50,379
"Foolish"?
I'm beginning to think

561
00:41:50,381 --> 00:41:52,047
that your personal
connection to him

562
00:41:52,049 --> 00:41:54,683
isn't an asset,
but a liability.

563
00:41:54,685 --> 00:41:58,654
If you want to benefit from this,
you will finish him for good

564
00:41:58,656 --> 00:42:00,792
and pray Trumbull
never wakes up.

565
00:42:01,225 --> 00:42:02,727
Your biggest mistake.

566
00:42:26,151 --> 00:42:28,051
This is 1-800-collect.

567
00:42:28,053 --> 00:42:29,986
You have a collect call
from...

568
00:42:29,988 --> 00:42:32,288
- Mike.
- Say yes to accept the charges.

569
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:34,790
- Yes, yes! Mike, is that you?
- Leah.

570
00:42:34,792 --> 00:42:36,928
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right.

571
00:42:38,462 --> 00:42:40,031
You okay? How's Lynne?

572
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:43,835
She's okay.

573
00:42:44,835 --> 00:42:45,904
She's here with me.

574
00:42:47,238 --> 00:42:49,174
We've been getting death threats.

575
00:42:54,178 --> 00:42:56,446
- Are the cops out front?
- Yeah.

576
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:59,214
- And a ton of reporters.
- Okay, that's a good thing.

577
00:42:59,216 --> 00:43:00,982
They'll watch the house 24/7.

578
00:43:00,984 --> 00:43:03,252
So you just make sure
you stay inside

579
00:43:03,254 --> 00:43:04,823
and they'll keep you safe.

580
00:43:08,292 --> 00:43:09,827
Have they talked to you?

581
00:43:10,794 --> 00:43:11,829
Yeah.

582
00:43:15,165 --> 00:43:17,102
Why didn't you tell me
about the doctors?

583
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,774
Babe, I wanted to.

584
00:43:22,607 --> 00:43:24,776
But I can't explain
right now. Just...

585
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:27,046
You gotta trust me.

586
00:43:31,915 --> 00:43:33,419
Where are you?
Are you in jail?

587
00:43:35,853 --> 00:43:37,955
Look, I'm not the only one
on the line.

588
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:41,824
Guys, I know
you got a job to do.

589
00:43:41,826 --> 00:43:43,025
So do I.

590
00:43:43,027 --> 00:43:44,527
And I'm not gonna stop

591
00:43:44,529 --> 00:43:46,131
until I prove
who really did this.

592
00:43:46,931 --> 00:43:49,168
I just want you
here, home with me.

593
00:43:52,169 --> 00:43:53,204
Me too.

594
00:43:56,073 --> 00:43:57,209
We're gonna get
through this, babe.

595
00:43:58,375 --> 00:43:59,477
You hear me?

596
00:44:00,111 --> 00:44:01,344
Yeah.

597
00:44:01,346 --> 00:44:02,815
Yeah, I hear you.

598
00:44:03,314 --> 00:44:06,017
Come on, Mike.
Come on, come on.

599
00:44:06,718 --> 00:44:08,821
High Mountain Militia.
Don't move.

600
00:44:15,859 --> 00:44:17,128
Mike, who is that?

601
00:44:17,661 --> 00:44:19,464
Hang up the phone now, mister.

602
00:44:20,431 --> 00:44:21,900
Do it.

603
00:44:22,866 --> 00:44:23,935
Now.

604
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:26,835
I gotta go.

605
00:44:26,837 --> 00:44:27,872
Do it!

606
00:44:29,274 --> 00:44:30,308
I love you.

607
00:44:33,277 --> 00:44:34,877
Mike.

608
00:44:34,879 --> 00:44:36,112
We got it.

609
00:44:36,114 --> 00:44:38,047
The truck stop on Highway 163.

610
00:44:38,049 --> 00:44:40,415
Get every local unit in
the area and surround it.

611
00:44:40,417 --> 00:44:42,086
Let's see those hands.
Turn around.

612
00:44:43,587 --> 00:44:45,154
Holy shit.

613
00:44:45,156 --> 00:44:47,493
We got us America's
Most Wanted here, Tim.

614
00:44:49,326 --> 00:44:52,064
Bet there's a big ol' bounty
on your ass.

615
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:56,866
Tim, you stay on him. I'm gonna call it in.
If he moves, shoot him.

616
00:44:56,868 --> 00:45:00,239
Shit. He moves a
muscle, I'll light his ass up.

617
00:45:05,843 --> 00:45:07,979
- You were saying?
- Shoot him, Tim.

618
00:45:08,946 --> 00:45:10,047
Shoot him!

619
00:45:10,848 --> 00:45:13,216
- Shit.
- What the hell you doing?

620
00:45:13,218 --> 00:45:15,317
I ain't dying for this shit, Bobby.

621
00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:18,453
- Goddamn it.
- Your mountain militia needs help.

622
00:45:18,455 --> 00:45:21,325
You'd best drop that gun, boy.

623
00:45:23,093 --> 00:45:24,296
Fuck.

624
00:45:27,131 --> 00:45:28,533
Your keys in the truck?

625
00:45:30,234 --> 00:45:31,402
What?

626
00:45:39,576 --> 00:45:41,113
Fuck you!

627
00:46:17,948 --> 00:46:19,151
Fuck!

628
00:46:28,692 --> 00:46:31,060
Suspect
is in a tractor trailer.

629
00:46:31,062 --> 00:46:33,065
Backup is needed immediately.

630
00:46:35,132 --> 00:46:36,901
Pull over the vehicle!

631
00:46:38,035 --> 00:46:39,070
Pull over!

632
00:46:43,507 --> 00:46:44,877
Pull over the vehicle!

633
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:55,988
Officer down! Officer down!

634
00:46:58,288 --> 00:46:59,323
Shit!

635
00:47:02,593 --> 00:47:03,928
Jesus Christ!

636
00:47:06,997 --> 00:47:10,368
He's turning south on Vessel.
I repeat, south on Vessel.

637
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,074
Suspect
is armed and dangerous.

638
00:47:19,076 --> 00:47:20,444
Proceed with caution.

639
00:47:25,015 --> 00:47:27,251
Three units in pursuit.
Backup is needed immediately.

640
00:47:29,187 --> 00:47:30,422
This guy's crazy!

641
00:47:35,593 --> 00:47:37,726
- Shit!
- We got him in sight.

642
00:47:37,728 --> 00:47:39,131
South on Vessel.

643
00:47:45,669 --> 00:47:47,538
Holy fucking shit!

644
00:48:00,051 --> 00:48:02,118
Reverse! Move! Reverse!

645
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,022
- Christ.
- Get out of the fucking way!

646
00:48:04,455 --> 00:48:07,656
- Move! Move!
- He's on a service road, west on Vessel.

647
00:48:07,658 --> 00:48:09,962
Use caution
as it's an unmaintained...

648
00:48:25,243 --> 00:48:26,578
Helicopter is on route.

649
00:48:35,585 --> 00:48:38,589
He's headed down
a dirt road by mile marker 33.

650
00:48:41,091 --> 00:48:43,527
Okay,
the chopper has him. Thank you.

651
00:48:52,803 --> 00:48:55,139
Mile marker 33.
All units converge.

652
00:49:04,181 --> 00:49:05,384
Ah, shit. I've lost him.

653
00:49:43,488 --> 00:49:46,154
Suspect has crashed.
Suspect has crashed.

654
00:49:46,156 --> 00:49:48,125
Mile marker 34.

655
00:50:21,225 --> 00:50:22,790
- Check the cab!
- Get a light over here!

656
00:50:22,792 --> 00:50:24,393
Does anybody have any visual?

657
00:50:58,663 --> 00:50:59,865
Shit.

658
00:51:00,966 --> 00:51:02,864
If those dogs haven't found him
yet, he's gone.

659
00:51:02,866 --> 00:51:05,136
Fuck it. Just bring 'em in.

660
00:51:06,071 --> 00:51:08,571
- Blood's back from the Suburban.
- Really?

661
00:51:08,573 --> 00:51:11,609
None of it's Banning's.
In fact, no matches at all yet.

662
00:51:13,578 --> 00:51:15,578
Any activity
on his encrypted folder?

663
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:16,815
Nothing.

664
00:51:17,915 --> 00:51:18,917
Fuck.

665
00:51:20,283 --> 00:51:21,350
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey.

666
00:51:21,352 --> 00:51:22,587
Can I have a word? Hey!

667
00:51:23,821 --> 00:51:24,853
Wanna talk to the
nice people from the press?

668
00:51:24,855 --> 00:51:26,825
News 24! Can I have a word?

669
00:51:27,325 --> 00:51:29,261
- No.
- No?

670
00:51:31,294 --> 00:51:32,761
How solid is this intel

671
00:51:32,763 --> 00:51:34,295
that Banning colluded
with the Russians?

672
00:51:34,297 --> 00:51:35,730
It's tricky, sir.

673
00:51:35,732 --> 00:51:37,466
The evidence
definitely points to that,

674
00:51:37,468 --> 00:51:39,801
but it's hard to prove
if it's really Moscow's doing

675
00:51:39,803 --> 00:51:42,004
or an outside hacker
who wants it to look that way.

676
00:51:42,006 --> 00:51:43,440
Outside hacker?

677
00:51:44,674 --> 00:51:47,609
Hackers don't pay out $10
million for assassinations.

678
00:51:47,611 --> 00:51:49,314
None have before, no.

679
00:51:50,848 --> 00:51:53,848
The problem is the Russians will deny
this to the end if we take action.

680
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:58,020
But if we don't, they'll remain ambiguous
as to their involvement, so we look weak.

681
00:51:58,022 --> 00:51:59,621
Just like with their
election tampering.

682
00:51:59,623 --> 00:52:02,391
I really think we should
slow down here, sir,

683
00:52:02,393 --> 00:52:03,859
before this
blows up in our face.

684
00:52:03,861 --> 00:52:05,928
The president
of the United States

685
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:07,562
is lying in a coma,

686
00:52:07,564 --> 00:52:09,967
and 18 Secret Service agents
are dead.

687
00:52:10,567 --> 00:52:12,736
This already blew up
in our face!

688
00:52:29,853 --> 00:52:32,754
A statewide manhunt
is under way for Secret Service agent...

689
00:52:32,756 --> 00:52:34,989
A massive manhunt
for Banning has already begun.

690
00:52:34,991 --> 00:52:36,692
His face will be
plastered everywhere,

691
00:52:36,694 --> 00:52:38,630
so he won't be able
to use public transport.

692
00:52:39,464 --> 00:52:42,063
What time did the police
call in the semi crash?

693
00:52:42,065 --> 00:52:43,968
Scanner traffic
pegs it at 4:17 a.m.

694
00:52:44,502 --> 00:52:47,803
That puts him at, what,
about a 200-mile range of the crash?

695
00:52:47,805 --> 00:52:49,737
- Two-forty.
- Two-forty.

696
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:51,507
Okay, listen up, everybody.

697
00:52:51,509 --> 00:52:53,741
Mike will have to find
somewhere to regroup.

698
00:52:53,743 --> 00:52:55,344
Dig into his life.

699
00:52:55,346 --> 00:52:58,315
Find out anything,
anyone that can hide him.

700
00:52:58,882 --> 00:53:00,748
Every hour you don't
have an answer for me

701
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:02,853
is another hour
he's kicking our fucking ass.

702
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,603
How the fuck did you find me?

703
00:54:26,636 --> 00:54:29,606
I run security for the president.
How do you think?

704
00:54:31,107 --> 00:54:33,509
You've been here
the last five years.

705
00:54:33,511 --> 00:54:35,346
North Carolina before that.

706
00:54:36,113 --> 00:54:37,815
Alaska before that.

707
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:42,520
You see,
that's Big Brother for you.

708
00:54:43,187 --> 00:54:47,359
No, actually, it was just me
wondering if you were still alive.

709
00:54:50,493 --> 00:54:51,729
Did you do it?

710
00:54:54,198 --> 00:54:56,033
You'd like it if I did,
wouldn't you...

711
00:54:57,067 --> 00:54:58,103
Dad?

712
00:55:05,843 --> 00:55:07,542
I'm not gonna stay long.

713
00:55:07,544 --> 00:55:09,813
Just need a place off-grid,
lie low for a bit.

714
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:15,853
- Hey, you got any water?
- Yeah.

715
00:55:19,122 --> 00:55:21,156
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

716
00:55:21,158 --> 00:55:23,525
So you run off your own power
source, water, everything?

717
00:55:23,527 --> 00:55:24,596
Sure. Why not?

718
00:55:25,062 --> 00:55:27,161
You stay attached
to their tentacles,

719
00:55:27,163 --> 00:55:28,932
they own you for life.

720
00:55:35,004 --> 00:55:38,473
Fuck. Hey, you got any aspirin?
Something stronger?

721
00:55:38,475 --> 00:55:40,808
I don't do medications.

722
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:42,877
- Of course you don't.
- And by the looks of it,

723
00:55:42,879 --> 00:55:44,681
you shouldn't either.

724
00:55:48,185 --> 00:55:49,687
What's this?

725
00:55:51,654 --> 00:55:53,190
Writing your own manifesto?

726
00:55:53,623 --> 00:55:56,058
You know, I've had
a lifetime to think about

727
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:58,560
the things I've seen
and I've done.

728
00:55:58,562 --> 00:56:02,531
I don't want to ever forget.
That's how we get lost.

729
00:56:02,533 --> 00:56:04,065
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

730
00:56:04,067 --> 00:56:05,770
What chapter am I in?

731
00:56:11,808 --> 00:56:13,511
Why are they saying it's you?

732
00:56:14,011 --> 00:56:15,277
I was set up.

733
00:56:15,279 --> 00:56:18,049
Not a surprise.
Fucking government.

734
00:56:18,982 --> 00:56:20,882
No, not the government.

735
00:56:20,884 --> 00:56:23,851
It was a friend of mine.
I'm trying to figure out who else.

736
00:56:23,853 --> 00:56:26,658
Sounds like you should
pick better friends, son.

737
00:56:27,491 --> 00:56:30,127
You know what?
Don't call me "son."

738
00:56:30,794 --> 00:56:33,864
You lost that right when you
walked out on Mom and me.

739
00:56:39,602 --> 00:56:41,071
I know what I did.

740
00:56:42,872 --> 00:56:44,475
But I'd do it again.

741
00:56:44,908 --> 00:56:48,479
Because of what fucking war
made me, turned me into.

742
00:56:49,047 --> 00:56:52,517
And I see it in you.
I can see it in your eyes.

743
00:56:53,216 --> 00:56:56,784
You think Iraq
was different than Nam?

744
00:56:56,786 --> 00:56:58,953
Nam different than Korea?

745
00:56:58,955 --> 00:57:01,792
No, it's the fucking
same thing! It's war!

746
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:05,263
And it doesn't matter
what you give them.

747
00:57:05,962 --> 00:57:08,932
You'll give it because
you don't know any better!

748
00:57:09,799 --> 00:57:11,333
And they'll take it.

749
00:57:11,335 --> 00:57:14,606
Your honor, your youth,
your life!

750
00:57:27,283 --> 00:57:31,256
Me disappearing was the best
thing that ever happened to you.

751
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:36,093
You wouldn't have liked me.

752
00:57:55,712 --> 00:57:56,881
Good afternoon.

753
00:57:58,214 --> 00:58:01,616
There has been no change in
President Trumbull's condition.

754
00:58:01,618 --> 00:58:03,220
He remains in a coma.

755
00:58:04,388 --> 00:58:06,123
And while
we pray for the best...

756
00:58:07,558 --> 00:58:11,859
we must now recognize that the
world as we knew it has changed.

757
00:58:11,861 --> 00:58:14,962
After careful and diligent work,
our intelligence communities

758
00:58:14,964 --> 00:58:19,201
have unanimously concluded that
Secret Service agent Mike Banning

759
00:58:19,203 --> 00:58:22,203
planned and carried out
the assassination attempt

760
00:58:22,205 --> 00:58:23,874
on the president...

761
00:58:24,442 --> 00:58:27,645
with full support
from top levels...

762
00:58:28,212 --> 00:58:30,011
of the Russian government.

763
00:58:30,013 --> 00:58:32,279
Mr. President. Mr. President.

764
00:58:32,281 --> 00:58:34,718
All options are on the table.

765
00:58:35,285 --> 00:58:38,819
To that end,
I have just signed an executive order

766
00:58:38,821 --> 00:58:43,091
calling for the use of a bold and
strong private contractor force

767
00:58:43,093 --> 00:58:44,962
to be employed
in our strategy.

768
00:58:45,495 --> 00:58:48,031
Looks like we're finally
going back to work.

769
00:58:49,065 --> 00:58:50,301
Found him!

770
00:58:51,701 --> 00:58:54,201
- Talk to me.
- We hacked into Banning's government IP server

771
00:58:54,203 --> 00:58:55,337
and compiled
his search history.

772
00:58:55,339 --> 00:58:56,904
Over his entire career,

773
00:58:56,906 --> 00:58:58,375
Banning's been constantly
monitoring this.

774
00:58:59,877 --> 00:59:03,178
It's a social security number that's
collecting VA disability benefits.

775
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:04,315
Check this.

776
00:59:06,884 --> 00:59:09,320
That's Clay Banning.
That's Mike's old man.

777
00:59:09,852 --> 00:59:13,355
He told me all about him. He was a
decorated ranger in Nam and a tunnel rat.

778
00:59:13,357 --> 00:59:16,861
He came back, he went crazy,
left everyone, and was gone.

779
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,330
Where's Daddy now?

780
00:59:21,732 --> 00:59:22,900
West Virginia.

781
00:59:30,306 --> 00:59:33,011
Mike. Mike.

782
00:59:34,277 --> 00:59:35,312
Mike.

783
00:59:39,082 --> 00:59:42,850
- How long I been out?
- Long enough for your friend to find you.

784
00:59:42,852 --> 00:59:44,055
Come on.

785
00:59:47,725 --> 00:59:49,857
There. There.

786
00:59:49,859 --> 00:59:51,895
- Shit.
- Yeah.

787
00:59:53,763 --> 00:59:55,196
- There's at least 15 of them.
- Yeah.

788
00:59:55,198 --> 00:59:57,265
I ain't gonna hold them off
with this pistol.

789
00:59:57,267 --> 01:00:00,067
- We gotta get outta here.
- I ain't going nowhere.

790
01:00:00,069 --> 01:00:03,170
- What?
- No, no, this is my fucking mountain!

791
01:00:03,172 --> 01:00:05,406
- No, don't go out there.
- Stay here if you want.

792
01:00:05,408 --> 01:00:06,777
Shit.

793
01:00:10,413 --> 01:00:12,749
- What are you doing?
- Open that up.

794
01:00:17,154 --> 01:00:18,356
What the...

795
01:00:21,491 --> 01:00:23,194
Now, wait a minute.

796
01:00:24,527 --> 01:00:25,861
Okay.

797
01:00:25,863 --> 01:00:27,161
Why did I think coming here

798
01:00:27,163 --> 01:00:28,830
was a good idea?

799
01:00:28,832 --> 01:00:30,899
I knew you had time to kill,
but Jesus!

800
01:00:30,901 --> 01:00:33,971
Just keep low
and don't bitch.

801
01:00:44,848 --> 01:00:45,950
What are you doing?

802
01:00:50,254 --> 01:00:52,821
All right, you stay here.
I'm gonna go and draw them out.

803
01:00:52,823 --> 01:00:55,225
- No, no, I wouldn't.
- Why?

804
01:00:55,792 --> 01:00:57,894
Old bull, young bull.

805
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,470
- What the fuck?
- That way! They're over there!

806
01:01:07,404 --> 01:01:11,109
- Great! Now they know where we are!
- Good. Fuck 'em.

807
01:01:15,946 --> 01:01:17,181
Fuck!

808
01:01:18,881 --> 01:01:23,353
- Okay, you stay here!
- What? Jesus Christ.

809
01:01:32,228 --> 01:01:33,297
Are you kidding me?

810
01:01:50,881 --> 01:01:51,949
Fuck!

811
01:02:13,437 --> 01:02:14,906
Fucking crazy!

812
01:02:18,341 --> 01:02:20,174
You almost
blew me up, damn it!

813
01:02:20,176 --> 01:02:22,412
I didn't tell you
to run down there.

814
01:02:23,247 --> 01:02:26,013
Oh, shit.
Well, I hope you got more fun and games,

815
01:02:26,015 --> 01:02:27,649
'cause we're about
to be overrun!

816
01:02:27,651 --> 01:02:29,884
- Go pull on that wire.
- What wire?

817
01:02:29,886 --> 01:02:32,187
In the fucking leaves!
Where else?

818
01:02:32,189 --> 01:02:34,024
- Fuck!
- Go get it!

819
01:02:38,527 --> 01:02:39,964
Go!

820
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:02,219
Really?

821
01:03:03,152 --> 01:03:04,421
You're welcome.

822
01:03:19,502 --> 01:03:21,335
You need to hear this.

823
01:03:21,337 --> 01:03:22,670
Our intelligence communities

824
01:03:22,672 --> 01:03:24,438
have unanimously concluded

825
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,473
that Secret Service agent
Mike Banning

826
01:03:26,475 --> 01:03:28,475
planned and carried out

827
01:03:28,477 --> 01:03:31,011
the assassination attempt
on the president

828
01:03:31,013 --> 01:03:35,417
with full support from top
levels of the Russian government.

829
01:03:35,419 --> 01:03:37,585
This announcement
from Vice President Kirby...

830
01:03:37,587 --> 01:03:41,255
- I told you they'd turn on you!
- You know, stop.

831
01:03:41,257 --> 01:03:44,259
All right, just stop with
all your Big Brother shit.

832
01:03:44,261 --> 01:03:47,295
Okay, your country didn't betray you!
You betrayed yourself!

833
01:03:47,297 --> 01:03:50,198
What the fuck
do you know about it?

834
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,600
- I struggled all my life with this!
- What struggle?

835
01:03:53,602 --> 01:03:55,238
You gave up!

836
01:04:05,082 --> 01:04:07,585
You're right, son,
I did give up.

837
01:04:08,185 --> 01:04:11,518
But sometimes it's better
to know when to quit

838
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,057
instead of
lying to yourself...

839
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:17,027
and hurting the ones
you love.

840
01:04:30,406 --> 01:04:33,176
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling a friend.

841
01:04:49,259 --> 01:04:50,962
It's Frost.

842
01:04:52,129 --> 01:04:54,230
No, it's not.
Put him through.

843
01:04:55,031 --> 01:04:57,399
Guess I should've
sent more guys, huh?

844
01:04:57,401 --> 01:04:59,234
Why don't you come yourself?

845
01:04:59,236 --> 01:05:01,636
Yeah, tell him to send
all the fuckheads he's got

846
01:05:01,638 --> 01:05:04,071
in that shitty outfit of his!

847
01:05:09,513 --> 01:05:12,379
Sounds like your dad's
all fired up.

848
01:05:12,381 --> 01:05:14,150
What happened to you, Wade?

849
01:05:15,718 --> 01:05:18,420
- How did it come to this?
- Look, I wish it could've been different, Mike.

850
01:05:18,422 --> 01:05:21,993
But war is about deception,
and Trumbull was in the way.

851
01:05:22,625 --> 01:05:24,359
You were a necessary evil,

852
01:05:24,361 --> 01:05:26,661
caught in the right place
at the right time.

853
01:05:26,663 --> 01:05:29,263
Be thankful
that you're still breathing.

854
01:05:29,265 --> 01:05:30,300
Fuck you.

855
01:05:30,834 --> 01:05:33,467
So, what is it?
We get into another war

856
01:05:33,469 --> 01:05:35,335
and you get your billions
in contracts?

857
01:05:35,337 --> 01:05:37,404
You think it's about
the money, Mike?

858
01:05:37,406 --> 01:05:39,507
No, I wish I could
trade places with you.

859
01:05:39,509 --> 01:05:42,342
You're the one out there
fighting, fighting for life.

860
01:05:42,344 --> 01:05:46,017
Can you feel it?
Blood pumping? Yeah.

861
01:05:46,716 --> 01:05:51,685
Lions, Mike. Lions.
Now I get to have my fix, too.

862
01:05:51,687 --> 01:05:54,422
Oh, you'll get your fix.

863
01:05:54,424 --> 01:05:56,293
Don't worry about finding me.

864
01:05:56,792 --> 01:05:58,461
I'll find you.

865
01:06:01,665 --> 01:06:03,167
That's my Mike.

866
01:06:06,803 --> 01:06:08,471
That's my Mike.

867
01:06:15,377 --> 01:06:17,444
Has this ever been washed?

868
01:06:17,446 --> 01:06:19,149
No. Does it fit?

869
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:22,583
- Hold this.
- Wait. That's all you're taking?

870
01:06:22,585 --> 01:06:26,457
I ain't letting no bureaucratic
pricks read about my life.

871
01:06:31,828 --> 01:06:34,732
- Oh, my God. You still got it.
- Yeah.

872
01:06:35,665 --> 01:06:39,370
- She got an engine?
- She lights the tires.

873
01:06:51,281 --> 01:06:54,250
The toll cameras
are just up ahead.

874
01:06:54,917 --> 01:06:56,750
You sure about this?

875
01:06:56,752 --> 01:06:57,821
Yeah.

876
01:06:58,321 --> 01:07:00,687
Well, at least
disguise yourself.

877
01:07:00,689 --> 01:07:02,857
No. Then I look guilty.

878
01:07:02,859 --> 01:07:06,163
Well, you already look guilty.
What the fuck's the difference?

879
01:07:12,935 --> 01:07:15,105
HRT has cleared the cabin.

880
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:17,705
They say half the mountainside
was blown away.

881
01:07:17,707 --> 01:07:19,542
Bodies lined up on the porch.

882
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:22,413
I wonder why Banning
led us here.

883
01:07:32,556 --> 01:07:33,891
Jesus.

884
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:37,828
This is a fucking mess.

885
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:41,765
"We work for Salient."

886
01:07:43,767 --> 01:07:48,303
- Salient Global, owned and operated by...
- Wade Jennings.

887
01:07:48,305 --> 01:07:50,406
Yeah. You got a history?

888
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,574
I had to investigate
some of Salient's messes

889
01:07:53,576 --> 01:07:55,245
when I was over in Iraq.

890
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:59,446
- Any positive IDs?
- These guys? No, not a one.

891
01:07:59,448 --> 01:08:03,486
Again. Forensics says there's not a
single match in any Federal database.

892
01:08:04,587 --> 01:08:07,989
What is this?
Is this Moscow tying up loose ends,

893
01:08:07,991 --> 01:08:10,227
or is this Banning trying
to throw us off the trail?

894
01:08:12,696 --> 01:08:16,200
All right.
What if Banning was being set up?

895
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:19,366
Who would have the
capabilities to pull this off,

896
01:08:19,368 --> 01:08:20,904
and who would benefit
the most?

897
01:08:21,438 --> 01:08:23,737
Contract company like Salient.

898
01:08:23,739 --> 01:08:25,643
Get in on the war machine.

899
01:08:26,443 --> 01:08:28,008
I wanna dissect Salient.

900
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:29,509
I wanna know
what communication

901
01:08:29,511 --> 01:08:30,677
is flowing in, flowing out,

902
01:08:30,679 --> 01:08:32,280
who they're tapped into,

903
01:08:32,282 --> 01:08:33,551
who they're monitoring,
everybody.

904
01:08:34,751 --> 01:08:37,918
And you know what?
Let's go rattle Wade Jennings' cage.

905
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,322
On it.

906
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:57,541
President Trumbull?

907
01:08:58,041 --> 01:08:59,610
Can you open your eyes?

908
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:12,686
Is he coming out of it?

909
01:09:12,688 --> 01:09:14,856
Well, it's too early
to say for certain.

910
01:09:14,858 --> 01:09:16,591
But he's starting
to react to stimulus.

911
01:09:16,593 --> 01:09:18,495
It shows me
he's trying to wake up.

912
01:09:18,961 --> 01:09:20,797
You can go ahead and extubate.

913
01:09:22,631 --> 01:09:24,598
According to inside sources,

914
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,067
President Trumbull is now
responding to stimulus.

915
01:09:27,069 --> 01:09:29,870
Doctors aren't ready
to declare him out of danger,

916
01:09:29,872 --> 01:09:33,674
but are hopeful that this is a sign that
he will fully recover from his coma.

917
01:09:33,676 --> 01:09:36,543
More on Trumbull and what this
means to tensions with Russia later.

918
01:09:36,545 --> 01:09:39,347
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be thrilled.

919
01:09:39,349 --> 01:09:40,384
No, I am.

920
01:09:41,951 --> 01:09:43,918
But Wade's not gonna quit
till he's dead.

921
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,553
Well, you can call in
and warn them.

922
01:09:46,555 --> 01:09:48,759
Do you remember the part they think
I'm working with the Russians?

923
01:09:49,593 --> 01:09:51,394
Besides, I don't know
who else is in on it.

924
01:09:52,562 --> 01:09:53,697
No.

925
01:09:54,898 --> 01:09:57,332
I need to get
to the president himself.

926
01:09:57,334 --> 01:09:59,937
Yeah. Then your own guys
shoot you.

927
01:10:00,636 --> 01:10:01,971
Probably.

928
01:10:02,538 --> 01:10:06,009
Shit. Leah and Lynne.

929
01:10:06,477 --> 01:10:08,676
Who are Leah and Lynne?

930
01:10:08,678 --> 01:10:09,947
My wife and daughter.

931
01:10:12,448 --> 01:10:14,451
You got a wife
and a daughter? Oh.

932
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:17,720
Yeah. Look.

933
01:10:18,455 --> 01:10:21,058
I gotta go, okay?
I got you involved enough.

934
01:10:22,759 --> 01:10:24,392
Where you going?

935
01:10:24,394 --> 01:10:25,496
I'm gonna steal this car.

936
01:10:26,129 --> 01:10:27,531
Okay?

937
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:29,599
Yeah.

938
01:10:30,867 --> 01:10:31,935
I'll see you around.

939
01:10:36,639 --> 01:10:37,708
Mike!

940
01:10:45,681 --> 01:10:47,949
President
Trumbull's improving condition...

941
01:10:47,951 --> 01:10:50,785
calls into question the
retaliatory military response

942
01:10:50,787 --> 01:10:52,556
set by Vice President Kirby.

943
01:10:52,988 --> 01:10:56,958
Given Russia's aggression,
it's no time to re-posture.

944
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,093
America needs
to show strength.

945
01:10:59,095 --> 01:11:00,660
Still,
if and when President Trumbull

946
01:11:00,662 --> 01:11:02,562
is back in command,

947
01:11:02,564 --> 01:11:04,699
a reversal of Kirby's policy
could be at hand.

948
01:11:06,001 --> 01:11:08,002
It's the secure number.

949
01:11:08,004 --> 01:11:10,405
Renegade 607, confirming.

950
01:11:10,407 --> 01:11:11,809
Did you see the news?

951
01:11:12,376 --> 01:11:14,475
We have a contingency plan.

952
01:11:14,477 --> 01:11:17,447
- It better work, or I cut rope.
- Excuse me?

953
01:11:17,915 --> 01:11:20,047
Don't worry.
I know what you're capable of.

954
01:11:20,049 --> 01:11:21,652
That's why I chose you.

955
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:25,689
But don't you underestimate me
for a second.

956
01:11:26,523 --> 01:11:29,727
There's a reason I've survived
Washington for this long.

957
01:11:30,493 --> 01:11:35,562
It's time to take the gloves off
and make this country strong again.

958
01:11:35,564 --> 01:11:38,031
The question is,
are you gonna be standing there with me?

959
01:11:38,033 --> 01:11:40,468
Speaking of,
where is my contract?

960
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:42,803
I don't plant $10 million
dollars for shits and giggles.

961
01:11:42,805 --> 01:11:45,573
It is right here,
ready to send.

962
01:11:45,575 --> 01:11:50,013
Finish the job, and your bet
will parlay into billions.

963
01:11:58,888 --> 01:12:01,755
- You trust him to deliver?
- Just get the fucking job done!

964
01:12:01,757 --> 01:12:03,594
What's going on
with our insurance policy?

965
01:12:06,229 --> 01:12:08,065
It's happening as we speak.

966
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,767
Aw, here,
let me wipe that off. Here.

967
01:12:12,769 --> 01:12:13,971
Here, you wanna
wipe your hands on that?

968
01:12:14,804 --> 01:12:16,140
There, that's better.

969
01:12:20,844 --> 01:12:22,712
What the fuck
are you doing?

970
01:12:23,712 --> 01:12:25,081
So sorry to alarm you, Leah.

971
01:12:25,514 --> 01:12:28,184
So sorry to alarm you.

972
01:12:28,684 --> 01:12:31,651
We snuck around the back
to avoid the press and police.

973
01:12:31,653 --> 01:12:34,655
What the fuck are you doing in my house?
Get out of my house!

974
01:12:34,657 --> 01:12:36,524
Wade Jennings sent us.

975
01:12:36,526 --> 01:12:37,892
He heard from Mike
you're getting death threats

976
01:12:37,894 --> 01:12:39,660
and asked us to escort you
to his compound.

977
01:12:39,662 --> 01:12:41,995
What? I don't care
who sent you! Get out!

978
01:12:41,997 --> 01:12:43,634
- Leah.
- It's okay.

979
01:12:45,868 --> 01:12:48,805
Please. Please don't resist.

980
01:12:49,639 --> 01:12:52,910
For little Lynne here,
it's better we go quietly.

981
01:12:56,045 --> 01:12:57,748
Okay. Okay.

982
01:12:59,248 --> 01:13:00,818
Okay. Okay.

983
01:13:01,551 --> 01:13:03,653
Okay. We're going.

984
01:13:04,287 --> 01:13:06,119
I want Daddy!

985
01:13:06,121 --> 01:13:07,590
All right, come on.

986
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:18,602
- Mommy.
- Ohh.

987
01:13:30,112 --> 01:13:33,850
This wasn't the way
I wanted to introduce myself.

988
01:13:35,084 --> 01:13:36,620
I'm Clay Banning.

989
01:13:38,187 --> 01:13:39,689
Mike's dad.

990
01:13:42,959 --> 01:13:45,796
How... How...
How would I know it's you?

991
01:13:47,296 --> 01:13:52,001
Well, the reason you don't
know that truth already is...

992
01:13:52,469 --> 01:13:54,270
because of me alone.

993
01:13:56,706 --> 01:13:58,775
Tell me something personal
about him.

994
01:14:04,212 --> 01:14:07,315
The only thing
I have for you is...

995
01:14:07,317 --> 01:14:09,051
his birth name.

996
01:14:11,653 --> 01:14:15,591
Michael Jameson Banning.

997
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:20,964
Born on base,
Fort Hood, Texas.

998
01:14:22,831 --> 01:14:24,867
His mother's maiden name...

999
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:32,775
Mary Alice... DeWitt.

1000
01:14:36,379 --> 01:14:42,184
And to this day,
I deeply regret walking away from them.

1001
01:14:48,858 --> 01:14:50,627
That looks kind of deep.

1002
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,196
We should get it cleaned up.

1003
01:15:13,849 --> 01:15:17,286
Sir? What exactly
do you remember?

1004
01:15:21,224 --> 01:15:23,193
Some kind of drone attack.

1005
01:15:24,394 --> 01:15:26,229
I was floating in the water.

1006
01:15:28,363 --> 01:15:30,834
A lot of my protection
team killed.

1007
01:15:34,403 --> 01:15:37,373
Do you remember where
Mike Banning was at the time, sir?

1008
01:15:40,143 --> 01:15:41,645
Was Mike killed?

1009
01:15:43,813 --> 01:15:45,716
This is very difficult
to say, sir.

1010
01:15:46,483 --> 01:15:49,016
We know how much you trusted him.
We all did.

1011
01:15:49,018 --> 01:15:51,118
But we found that Mike
was hiding certain things

1012
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,323
from the Secret Service
and you.

1013
01:15:55,957 --> 01:15:56,993
What things?

1014
01:15:58,060 --> 01:15:59,895
Both physical
and mental issues.

1015
01:16:00,595 --> 01:16:03,297
The FBI also has
substantial evidence

1016
01:16:03,299 --> 01:16:05,202
that he was getting support
from the Kremlin.

1017
01:16:06,001 --> 01:16:08,270
Including
a $10 million payment.

1018
01:16:11,741 --> 01:16:12,776
What else?

1019
01:16:14,477 --> 01:16:17,712
Kirby's very close
to going to war

1020
01:16:17,714 --> 01:16:19,850
with Russia over
the assassination attempt.

1021
01:16:22,151 --> 01:16:24,888
- Get him on the phone.
- Yes, sir.

1022
01:16:36,131 --> 01:16:38,367
Okay, we found a way in.
No compromise.

1023
01:16:39,736 --> 01:16:41,368
I don't pay you guys
enough money.

1024
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:43,073
We have
an incoming helicopter.

1025
01:16:44,005 --> 01:16:45,174
Get a camera on that.

1026
01:16:48,044 --> 01:16:49,810
Salient, this is 145

1027
01:16:49,812 --> 01:16:51,745
with the FBI on a matter
of national security.

1028
01:16:51,747 --> 01:16:52,848
Permission to land.

1029
01:16:56,452 --> 01:16:58,021
145, you're clear to land.

1030
01:17:08,965 --> 01:17:11,768
Okay,
got a court order for the wiretaps...

1031
01:17:13,301 --> 01:17:16,302
and CID is looking at
the Salient servers now.

1032
01:17:16,304 --> 01:17:19,775
Good. Now let's see
what he has to say.

1033
01:17:39,095 --> 01:17:41,932
Mr. Jennings.
I'm Helen Thompson.

1034
01:17:42,631 --> 01:17:45,132
I don't think
we've ever had the privilege.

1035
01:17:45,134 --> 01:17:46,837
I wouldn't call it
a privilege.

1036
01:17:48,572 --> 01:17:53,376
Agent Thompson's the reason we're fighting
our wars with one hand tied to our dicks.

1037
01:17:55,211 --> 01:17:57,244
So I guess you know
why we're here.

1038
01:17:57,246 --> 01:17:59,312
You said it was
a matter of national security.

1039
01:17:59,314 --> 01:18:01,951
Yeah. When was the last time
you spoke to Mike Banning?

1040
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:10,156
Well, if you're doing your job,
you'd know the answer to that.

1041
01:18:10,158 --> 01:18:11,193
Oh, I do.

1042
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:13,929
Let's see if we've come up
with the same answer.

1043
01:18:35,917 --> 01:18:37,120
I am what I am.

1044
01:18:44,894 --> 01:18:47,397
If Mike led her here,
the feds will be onto us.

1045
01:18:48,531 --> 01:18:49,899
We're pulling the plug.

1046
01:18:50,433 --> 01:18:51,632
The whole thing?

1047
01:18:51,634 --> 01:18:53,036
Yeah, Salient's over.

1048
01:18:54,202 --> 01:18:55,404
We're moving offshore.

1049
01:18:56,005 --> 01:18:57,507
Roger.
I'll crack the whip.

1050
01:18:58,707 --> 01:19:01,844
And on the way out,
we're making sure this gets done.

1051
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:03,546
No matter what...

1052
01:19:05,147 --> 01:19:06,550
Trumbull's
fucking dying today.

1053
01:19:23,366 --> 01:19:25,298
The
White House has just confirmed

1054
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:26,901
that acting President
Martin Kirby

1055
01:19:26,903 --> 01:19:28,468
has made
the unilateral decision

1056
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:30,404
to retaliate against Russia

1057
01:19:30,406 --> 01:19:32,975
for the assassination attempt
on Allan Trumbull.

1058
01:19:36,312 --> 01:19:38,381
Two forward, let's go.
Stop there, please.

1059
01:19:53,162 --> 01:19:54,197
Hey.

1060
01:19:55,163 --> 01:19:57,463
- I need you to get in the trunk.
- Okay.

1061
01:20:02,938 --> 01:20:07,141
All units, 11-99. Need assistance.
We have a gunman outside the ER.

1062
01:20:07,143 --> 01:20:09,944
I repeat: We have
a gunman outside the ER.

1063
01:20:09,946 --> 01:20:12,478
Secure the ER.
And I wanna know who the fuck that is.

1064
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,448
All teams, close in, close in!

1065
01:20:14,450 --> 01:20:15,484
Move it! Move!

1066
01:20:17,553 --> 01:20:19,189
Go, go, go, go!

1067
01:20:19,788 --> 01:20:21,992
All units
converge on the first floor.

1068
01:20:30,433 --> 01:20:33,566
Shots fired! Shots fired!
All available posts respond!

1069
01:20:33,568 --> 01:20:34,603
Let's go!

1070
01:20:35,136 --> 01:20:36,907
Unit six responding.

1071
01:20:43,278 --> 01:20:44,645
Emergency room clear.

1072
01:20:44,647 --> 01:20:46,179
No contact. All clear.

1073
01:20:46,181 --> 01:20:47,513
ER's a mess.

1074
01:20:47,515 --> 01:20:49,749
Thought I'd use
the elevators down here.

1075
01:20:49,751 --> 01:20:52,619
Hey, I need to see
your face and ID. Hey!

1076
01:20:52,621 --> 01:20:53,957
Don't move!

1077
01:20:54,756 --> 01:20:57,259
- Mike?
- Hands in the air, Billy.

1078
01:20:58,493 --> 01:21:00,194
- What the fuck?
- Sorry, Billy.

1079
01:21:00,196 --> 01:21:02,029
You know we only put one guy

1080
01:21:02,031 --> 01:21:03,600
outside the service elevator.
Go on. Turn around.

1081
01:21:19,247 --> 01:21:20,780
- Gun!
- Put your weapon down!

1082
01:21:20,782 --> 01:21:24,317
Boys, stay calm. Stay calm.
Stay calm, okay?

1083
01:21:26,488 --> 01:21:28,021
Stay calm. Hey. Hey.

1084
01:21:28,023 --> 01:21:29,455
I just need
to speak to Gentry.

1085
01:21:29,457 --> 01:21:30,559
Get me Gentry!

1086
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,060
He wants to speak
to the vice president now.

1087
01:21:33,062 --> 01:21:35,294
- Gentry!
- Find him!

1088
01:21:35,296 --> 01:21:38,699
I don't wanna fucking hurt anybody!
I just need to speak to Gentry!

1089
01:21:38,701 --> 01:21:41,802
Gentry! David Gentry!

1090
01:21:41,804 --> 01:21:43,469
Get me David Gentry!

1091
01:21:46,742 --> 01:21:48,144
Put your weapon down now!

1092
01:21:52,514 --> 01:21:54,683
Have you completely
lost your mind?

1093
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:59,121
You have a true condition red here, David.
You need to get me to the president.

1094
01:22:00,322 --> 01:22:04,560
Why the fuck would I give myself up?
This is a real fucking threat!

1095
01:22:09,697 --> 01:22:10,733
What's happened, David?

1096
01:22:11,166 --> 01:22:13,102
We just arrested
Mike Banning, sir.

1097
01:22:13,736 --> 01:22:15,604
He's saying
we have a condition red.

1098
01:22:16,738 --> 01:22:18,174
Bring him to me.

1099
01:22:19,375 --> 01:22:20,807
Sir, we really should wait
to speak with the DOJ first...

1100
01:22:20,809 --> 01:22:22,011
Damn it, Sam!

1101
01:22:22,611 --> 01:22:23,747
Bring him right now.

1102
01:22:26,148 --> 01:22:27,183
Yes, sir.

1103
01:22:46,167 --> 01:22:49,339
Sir. I know
who did this to us.

1104
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:53,507
He's gonna try and finish the job.
You are not safe here, sir.

1105
01:22:53,509 --> 01:22:55,275
No, no. This is
the safest place for you, sir.

1106
01:22:55,277 --> 01:22:56,776
This place
is on total lockdown.

1107
01:22:56,778 --> 01:22:58,779
Then how the fuck
did I get here, Gentry?

1108
01:22:58,781 --> 01:23:01,181
You know all of our protocols,
and now you are in cuffs!

1109
01:23:01,183 --> 01:23:03,383
Sir, sir. I served with this man.
I know what he's capable of.

1110
01:23:03,385 --> 01:23:04,685
- We don't even know if this guy exists.
- He wants you dead.

1111
01:23:04,687 --> 01:23:06,320
All we have is Mike's word!

1112
01:23:06,322 --> 01:23:07,753
He will find a way
in here like I did.

1113
01:23:07,755 --> 01:23:09,323
Eighteen agents are dead!
You're still alive!

1114
01:23:09,325 --> 01:23:10,660
- We are sitting ducks.
- All right!

1115
01:23:15,197 --> 01:23:16,232
Uncuff him.

1116
01:23:18,334 --> 01:23:20,700
Sir, we still don't know
whose side Mike is really on.

1117
01:23:20,702 --> 01:23:21,737
Yes, we do.

1118
01:23:23,872 --> 01:23:25,174
He's on my side.

1119
01:23:27,876 --> 01:23:29,778
He's the reason
I'm still alive.

1120
01:23:32,747 --> 01:23:34,349
When you get
to be president...

1121
01:23:35,184 --> 01:23:37,821
you understand
that being spit on,

1122
01:23:38,354 --> 01:23:40,857
even betrayed,
comes with the job.

1123
01:23:42,424 --> 01:23:45,662
But it shouldn't come with his
or any of yours.

1124
01:23:47,862 --> 01:23:49,098
Now, uncuff him.

1125
01:23:55,604 --> 01:23:57,704
Okay, we need
to recheck everything.

1126
01:23:57,706 --> 01:23:59,338
And we need
to get him out of here now.

1127
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:00,874
Get Marine One inbound, okay.

1128
01:24:00,876 --> 01:24:03,513
And do not tell anyone
outside of this room.

1129
01:24:04,013 --> 01:24:05,849
Just do as Mike says.

1130
01:24:06,648 --> 01:24:08,417
- Sir.
- Yes, sir.

1131
01:24:15,724 --> 01:24:16,893
We're 20 minutes out.

1132
01:24:24,433 --> 01:24:27,334
- Marine One's 30 minutes out.
- God, it's taking too long.

1133
01:24:27,336 --> 01:24:29,203
The primary motorcade's
ready.

1134
01:24:29,205 --> 01:24:31,373
No, we're not going out
the front. It's too exposed.

1135
01:24:32,273 --> 01:24:36,178
Command Post, outer,
middle and inner perimeters all clear.

1136
01:24:36,812 --> 01:24:39,279
- Check snipers.
- They did, Mike.

1137
01:24:39,281 --> 01:24:40,382
Check 'em again.

1138
01:24:43,219 --> 01:24:44,487
Snipers, check in.

1139
01:24:46,388 --> 01:24:47,954
Overwatch to Command Post.

1140
01:24:47,956 --> 01:24:49,258
All sectors clear.

1141
01:24:50,759 --> 01:24:52,993
Oh.

1142
01:24:52,995 --> 01:24:55,829
This stupid thing has crashed
six times in the last hour.

1143
01:24:55,831 --> 01:24:57,667
Mine just did, too.
It's weird.

1144
01:24:58,934 --> 01:25:00,499
Why is that weird?

1145
01:25:00,501 --> 01:25:02,205
They were working
perfectly fine all week.

1146
01:25:03,272 --> 01:25:04,741
In fact,
they rarely crash like this.

1147
01:25:07,509 --> 01:25:11,445
Hey, see if any IP addresses
from a Salient Global in Virginia

1148
01:25:11,447 --> 01:25:13,012
are connected
to this hospital.

1149
01:25:13,014 --> 01:25:14,249
Do it.

1150
01:25:17,853 --> 01:25:19,785
I'm not seeing anything.

1151
01:25:19,787 --> 01:25:22,392
- Check for any breaches, any hacks.
- I'm on it.

1152
01:25:22,959 --> 01:25:25,562
- Searching.
- Come on, come on, come on.

1153
01:25:38,407 --> 01:25:41,441
- Where's that coming from?
- They connect to our oxygen lines.

1154
01:25:41,443 --> 01:25:42,946
Okay, get on the phone,
see what's wrong.

1155
01:25:54,322 --> 01:25:56,625
Somebody's controlling our gas
systems, and it's not us.

1156
01:25:58,861 --> 01:26:00,729
He's gonna blow this place.

1157
01:26:01,162 --> 01:26:03,297
I need the president ready
for transport up on the roof.

1158
01:26:03,299 --> 01:26:04,964
No, no, no.
We can't wait for Marine One.

1159
01:26:04,966 --> 01:26:07,034
We gotta go low viz and use
the emergency vehicles.

1160
01:26:07,036 --> 01:26:09,335
We're doing a full evac now.
Alert hospital security.

1161
01:26:09,337 --> 01:26:10,904
I want
Pathfinder ready to move.

1162
01:26:10,906 --> 01:26:12,507
Beds 2 and 7.

1163
01:26:13,207 --> 01:26:15,374
...stairwell nearest you.

1164
01:26:15,376 --> 01:26:17,946
Saint Matthews
is being evacuated.

1165
01:26:18,447 --> 01:26:21,013
Please exit the
building immediately. Attention.

1166
01:26:21,015 --> 01:26:23,016
Pathfinder's on the move.

1167
01:26:23,018 --> 01:26:24,817
Let's get some
monitors on battery packs.

1168
01:26:24,819 --> 01:26:25,955
We're moving out.

1169
01:26:27,089 --> 01:26:29,356
They discovered us.
They're evac-ing Saint Matthews.

1170
01:26:29,358 --> 01:26:30,957
Fucking Mike.
I knew it.

1171
01:26:30,959 --> 01:26:34,393
- How long before you can detonate?
- Four minutes.

1172
01:26:34,395 --> 01:26:36,929
- You got eyes on Trumbull?
- Negative. We got the rest of the hospital,

1173
01:26:36,931 --> 01:26:39,700
but Secret Service disabled the
ICU cams the second they arrived.

1174
01:26:39,702 --> 01:26:41,535
Well, find him.

1175
01:26:41,537 --> 01:26:43,506
Teams Two and Three,
circle the perimeter.

1176
01:26:46,474 --> 01:26:48,443
Bellhop Nine,
what's the status of the threat?

1177
01:26:49,377 --> 01:26:52,846
Someone's heating up the liquid
nitrogen to an unstable level.

1178
01:26:52,848 --> 01:26:55,348
And we have pure O2
leaking down here.

1179
01:26:55,350 --> 01:26:57,950
One spark and the explosion
can set off these tanks.

1180
01:26:57,952 --> 01:27:00,520
The blast could level the ICU
three times over.

1181
01:27:00,522 --> 01:27:02,489
- Can't you just kill the power?
- It's too late, sir.

1182
01:27:02,491 --> 01:27:04,490
- It could go at any time.
- Emergency vehicles ready!

1183
01:27:04,492 --> 01:27:05,691
- The garage secure?
- All secure.

1184
01:27:05,693 --> 01:27:08,027
- We can't stop it.
- Shit!

1185
01:27:08,029 --> 01:27:09,795
We can only
speculate it's some type of...

1186
01:27:09,797 --> 01:27:10,963
The president
is being evac'd now.

1187
01:27:10,965 --> 01:27:12,466
Sir, if Trumbull is awake,

1188
01:27:12,468 --> 01:27:14,133
we're gonna need
his authorization

1189
01:27:14,135 --> 01:27:16,136
before proceeding
with any kind of strike.

1190
01:27:16,138 --> 01:27:17,803
We don't even know
what condition he's in yet!

1191
01:27:17,805 --> 01:27:19,505
With all due respect, sir,
we should speak

1192
01:27:19,507 --> 01:27:21,842
to the attorney general
and get clarity.

1193
01:27:21,844 --> 01:27:23,910
The transfer of power
back to a president

1194
01:27:23,912 --> 01:27:25,544
has never happened
in our nation's history.

1195
01:27:25,546 --> 01:27:27,580
Which is exactly
why we do as I say

1196
01:27:27,582 --> 01:27:29,149
until we hear otherwise.

1197
01:27:29,151 --> 01:27:32,819
We stay with these op plans.
Am I clear?

1198
01:27:36,625 --> 01:27:38,557
- Is the road clear?
- Roger.

1199
01:27:38,559 --> 01:27:40,462
We only have two extra
vests in this truck.

1200
01:27:41,830 --> 01:27:44,367
Sir, I need you
to put this on real quick.

1201
01:28:01,116 --> 01:28:03,553
Step on it, Sims.
Get us away from this thing.

1202
01:28:05,053 --> 01:28:06,456
There. Back street.

1203
01:28:08,657 --> 01:28:10,123
Shit! Cover him!

1204
01:28:10,125 --> 01:28:12,426
Jam their comms.
Take away their backup.

1205
01:28:12,428 --> 01:28:13,863
Jamming Secret Service
comms now.

1206
01:28:14,830 --> 01:28:15,864
Back up, Sims.

1207
01:28:18,099 --> 01:28:19,434
Fuck.

1208
01:28:20,202 --> 01:28:21,767
Everybody out,
passenger side!

1209
01:28:21,769 --> 01:28:23,736
Go! Keep them pinned!

1210
01:28:23,738 --> 01:28:24,940
Bury them under the rubble!

1211
01:28:29,778 --> 01:28:31,911
Sir, we gotta move. Go, go, go.
Stay behind the wheel.

1212
01:28:31,913 --> 01:28:33,713
Home Team, this is Leader Six.

1213
01:28:33,715 --> 01:28:35,618
We're taking heavy fire
south of the hospital.

1214
01:28:41,657 --> 01:28:44,694
- This is Leader Six. Somebody answer me.
- Better move!

1215
01:28:48,529 --> 01:28:50,696
This is Team Leader Six.
We have Pathfinder.

1216
01:28:50,698 --> 01:28:53,799
We are taking heavy fire south of
the hospital. Does anybody copy?

1217
01:28:53,801 --> 01:28:55,004
I'm getting nothing!

1218
01:28:56,237 --> 01:28:57,937
We're almost to detonation.

1219
01:28:57,939 --> 01:29:01,007
Hospital's about to go!
Keep them pinned!

1220
01:29:01,009 --> 01:29:02,676
Let's get to that building
over there!

1221
01:29:02,678 --> 01:29:04,578
This is Leader Six.
Somebody answer me!

1222
01:29:04,580 --> 01:29:05,911
Listen to me, okay.
We're gonna make a move

1223
01:29:05,913 --> 01:29:07,547
and people
are gonna fall. Not you.

1224
01:29:07,549 --> 01:29:09,249
- You keep moving, okay? Ready?
- Yeah.

1225
01:29:09,251 --> 01:29:11,754
All right, let's go.
Everybody move! Go!

1226
01:29:23,564 --> 01:29:25,500
- Sam!
- Sir! Move! Move!

1227
01:29:39,681 --> 01:29:41,451
Triggering the igniter now.

1228
01:29:46,955 --> 01:29:48,090
Sir, go!

1229
01:30:18,787 --> 01:30:20,890
Get out! Get out the back!

1230
01:30:22,256 --> 01:30:23,658
Get the fuck out!

1231
01:30:24,225 --> 01:30:25,560
This way.

1232
01:30:27,129 --> 01:30:28,163
All right.

1233
01:30:29,697 --> 01:30:31,800
- Are you hit?
- I'm all right.

1234
01:30:36,037 --> 01:30:38,741
- Seal this fucking place off.
- Roger that.

1235
01:30:39,207 --> 01:30:42,142
Does anybody read me?

1236
01:30:42,144 --> 01:30:44,110
We got
a total comms blackout.

1237
01:30:44,112 --> 01:30:45,681
Does anybody
have a visual on Pathfinder?

1238
01:30:47,081 --> 01:30:48,949
- How's the leg?
- I'll live.

1239
01:30:48,951 --> 01:30:50,620
Look, I'm hearing nobody.
The comms are dead.

1240
01:30:51,086 --> 01:30:52,785
Wade saw us
coming in here, too.

1241
01:30:52,787 --> 01:30:54,223
We need to find
hard cover fast.

1242
01:30:57,893 --> 01:30:59,825
That's exactly
what we're gonna do.

1243
01:30:59,827 --> 01:31:02,197
All right, sir, all right.
We gotta go. We're moving!

1244
01:31:08,370 --> 01:31:09,604
Build a barricade.

1245
01:31:11,773 --> 01:31:13,543
Put them in front
of this corner office.

1246
01:31:20,815 --> 01:31:24,316
Does anyone copy?
Leader Six, do you have Pathfinder?

1247
01:31:30,291 --> 01:31:33,159
Alpha One, Team Two
circling back to rendezvous point.

1248
01:31:33,161 --> 01:31:34,730
ETA: 90 seconds.

1249
01:31:35,831 --> 01:31:36,866
Ah.

1250
01:31:38,166 --> 01:31:39,268
Okay.

1251
01:31:42,304 --> 01:31:43,703
- Good?
- Okay.

1252
01:31:43,705 --> 01:31:45,341
- All right.
- Dead.

1253
01:31:46,875 --> 01:31:50,310
Okay. Got fresh mags in both.
Hand me your nine.

1254
01:31:50,312 --> 01:31:54,116
- You sure this is gonna work?
- Has to. It's our only chance.

1255
01:31:54,782 --> 01:31:57,383
Just gotta hold them off long
enough until our people get here.

1256
01:31:57,385 --> 01:31:58,653
Hopefully soon.

1257
01:32:00,322 --> 01:32:03,192
Sir. I'll be back
before you know it.

1258
01:32:04,326 --> 01:32:05,361
Mike.

1259
01:32:08,295 --> 01:32:09,331
Stay alive.

1260
01:32:10,965 --> 01:32:12,000
Yes, sir.

1261
01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:17,936
- Run!
- Alpha One, Teams Two and Three

1262
01:32:17,938 --> 01:32:19,341
approaching rendezvous point.

1263
01:32:21,209 --> 01:32:24,076
Heads up.
FBI, HRT and SWAT have been dispatched.

1264
01:32:24,078 --> 01:32:25,982
And the National Guard's
been called in.

1265
01:32:26,782 --> 01:32:29,848
Half the country will be onto
this place in a matter of seconds.

1266
01:32:29,850 --> 01:32:31,851
- Let's get the job done.
- Move!

1267
01:32:31,853 --> 01:32:33,889
Move! Get out
of the fucking way!

1268
01:32:38,359 --> 01:32:39,728
Inside.

1269
01:32:40,162 --> 01:32:42,064
I'll try to make sure
they don't flank you.

1270
01:32:43,230 --> 01:32:44,867
Defend him
with everything you got.

1271
01:33:09,957 --> 01:33:11,093
They're in.

1272
01:33:22,871 --> 01:33:24,904
There.
The corner office.

1273
01:33:24,906 --> 01:33:26,042
Barricaded shooters.

1274
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:28,877
Team Three, get around
the back hallway. Flank 'em.

1275
01:33:29,812 --> 01:33:31,313
Roger. Moving into position.

1276
01:33:42,389 --> 01:33:43,425
Take open shots only.

1277
01:33:44,893 --> 01:33:45,928
Conserve ammo.

1278
01:33:49,197 --> 01:33:51,434
- Teams One and Two in position.
- Go.

1279
01:33:57,973 --> 01:33:59,007
Damn!

1280
01:34:09,317 --> 01:34:10,419
Fire!

1281
01:34:28,403 --> 01:34:29,739
Shit!

1282
01:34:32,107 --> 01:34:33,809
Move right! Move right!

1283
01:34:39,113 --> 01:34:40,215
They got Will!

1284
01:34:51,326 --> 01:34:52,428
Flush him out!

1285
01:34:57,532 --> 01:34:58,968
Shit!

1286
01:35:09,443 --> 01:35:11,346
Keep moving! Keep moving!

1287
01:35:15,317 --> 01:35:16,583
Bentley's gone!

1288
01:35:20,354 --> 01:35:22,120
Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

1289
01:35:22,122 --> 01:35:23,188
Last mag!

1290
01:35:23,190 --> 01:35:24,492
Let's fucking get 'em!

1291
01:35:42,143 --> 01:35:45,244
- I'm out!
- We need to fall back! Now!

1292
01:35:45,246 --> 01:35:46,347
Now!

1293
01:35:53,621 --> 01:35:54,856
Fuck.

1294
01:36:03,031 --> 01:36:04,998
You got a ton
of cops surrounding the building

1295
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,531
about to make entrance.

1296
01:36:06,533 --> 01:36:08,601
- Set my extract.
- Roger.

1297
01:36:08,603 --> 01:36:10,005
Go! Go, go, go.

1298
01:36:43,638 --> 01:36:46,375
He fucked us.
Mike hid him somewhere else.

1299
01:36:47,642 --> 01:36:50,112
War is about deception. Go.

1300
01:37:08,263 --> 01:37:10,029
Hurry, get to your exfil.

1301
01:37:10,031 --> 01:37:11,533
The cops shut down
the south entrance.

1302
01:37:15,636 --> 01:37:17,572
Police! Drop your weapons!

1303
01:37:18,506 --> 01:37:22,076
- On the ground!
- Drop your weapons now!

1304
01:37:24,345 --> 01:37:25,380
Police!

1305
01:37:28,450 --> 01:37:30,118
Get on the ground now!

1306
01:37:31,653 --> 01:37:32,688
Oh, shit.

1307
01:37:35,756 --> 01:37:38,591
- Lower your weapons right now!
- Get on the ground!

1308
01:37:38,593 --> 01:37:40,395
We have Pathfinder secure.

1309
01:38:55,470 --> 01:38:56,572
We're on the roof.

1310
01:39:17,724 --> 01:39:19,127
Fuck!

1311
01:39:30,839 --> 01:39:32,107
He's done. Let's go.

1312
01:39:32,573 --> 01:39:33,608
Come on.

1313
01:39:35,242 --> 01:39:36,609
Go on.

1314
01:39:36,611 --> 01:39:38,147
Fuck is wrong with you?

1315
01:39:38,612 --> 01:39:39,647
Come on!

1316
01:39:58,700 --> 01:39:59,734
Come on!

1317
01:40:01,870 --> 01:40:04,369
Come on.
Let's get the fuck outta here.

1318
01:40:04,371 --> 01:40:05,506
Move!

1319
01:42:04,259 --> 01:42:05,426
Ah!

1320
01:43:35,550 --> 01:43:36,852
I'm glad it was you.

1321
01:43:44,892 --> 01:43:46,295
Lions.

1322
01:43:49,697 --> 01:43:50,931
We're lions.

1323
01:44:31,938 --> 01:44:35,508
FBI officials have
dropped all charges against Mike Banning

1324
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:37,843
and its allegations
of Moscow's involvement

1325
01:44:37,845 --> 01:44:39,481
in the assassination attempt.

1326
01:44:39,913 --> 01:44:41,780
While reinstated President
Allan Trumbull

1327
01:44:41,782 --> 01:44:43,449
addressed
the other world leaders

1328
01:44:43,451 --> 01:44:45,183
at the G20
in Hamburg yesterday,

1329
01:44:45,185 --> 01:44:47,419
easing tensions with Russia,

1330
01:44:47,421 --> 01:44:50,588
sources say indictments
against the real perpetrators

1331
01:44:50,590 --> 01:44:52,526
are expected any moment.

1332
01:45:02,002 --> 01:45:05,704
Sir, welcome back.
I would've come to you.

1333
01:45:05,706 --> 01:45:08,740
Ah, no worries, Martin.
You've been busy.

1334
01:45:08,742 --> 01:45:09,977
Have a seat.

1335
01:45:11,612 --> 01:45:13,779
So, how are you feeling?

1336
01:45:13,781 --> 01:45:15,751
Oh, today I'm feeling...

1337
01:45:17,984 --> 01:45:19,755
- presidential.
- That's great.

1338
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:21,887
Mm-hmm.

1339
01:45:21,889 --> 01:45:24,589
So, before she was
gunned down,

1340
01:45:24,591 --> 01:45:27,528
a very heroic FBI agent
helped discover that...

1341
01:45:28,362 --> 01:45:33,167
Wade Jennings kept detailed
files of your dealings together.

1342
01:45:36,537 --> 01:45:38,573
- Did he?
- Insurance.

1343
01:45:39,206 --> 01:45:41,906
I really thought of keeping
you on just to fuck with you

1344
01:45:41,908 --> 01:45:43,612
over the next
three and a half years.

1345
01:45:44,845 --> 01:45:47,014
But that's the old way
of doing things.

1346
01:45:48,114 --> 01:45:49,151
David?

1347
01:45:50,751 --> 01:45:53,619
Since this is his last day
before retirement,

1348
01:45:53,621 --> 01:45:57,459
David gets the honor of marching
you right out the front door.

1349
01:46:03,264 --> 01:46:04,800
You're joking, right?

1350
01:46:07,134 --> 01:46:08,136
No.

1351
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:15,540
What's going on here?

1352
01:46:15,542 --> 01:46:16,976
Kirby, can you
tell us anything?

1353
01:46:16,978 --> 01:46:18,747
Can you tell us anything
about what's happened?

1354
01:46:31,259 --> 01:46:34,962
Eat them on the whole row.
Yeah. One, two...

1355
01:46:35,862 --> 01:46:36,897
three.

1356
01:46:37,764 --> 01:46:38,999
- Four.
- Four.

1357
01:46:40,166 --> 01:46:41,232
Five.

1358
01:46:41,234 --> 01:46:44,235
- Six.
- Yay!

1359
01:46:48,742 --> 01:46:50,111
What are your plans,
Clay?

1360
01:46:51,178 --> 01:46:53,878
You know, I... I, uh...

1361
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:55,681
I found a little RV,

1362
01:46:55,683 --> 01:46:59,250
and I thought I'd just
go mobile for a while.

1363
01:46:59,252 --> 01:47:03,625
Go up in north when it's summer
and go south when it's winter.

1364
01:47:08,962 --> 01:47:11,265
So we're not gonna see you
for a while then, huh?

1365
01:47:17,572 --> 01:47:20,007
No, you're gonna see
a lot of me, yeah.

1366
01:47:20,608 --> 01:47:23,676
I'll just drive the RV over
here and park it out front.

1367
01:47:23,678 --> 01:47:25,777
I just don't want
to impose on you guys.

1368
01:47:25,779 --> 01:47:27,579
You don't have to stay out
in the RV, Dad.

1369
01:47:27,581 --> 01:47:28,948
We got plenty
of room in the house, huh?

1370
01:47:28,950 --> 01:47:30,316
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

1371
01:47:30,318 --> 01:47:31,953
No, we'd love
to have you around.

1372
01:47:32,553 --> 01:47:33,822
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1373
01:47:36,122 --> 01:47:38,990
Thank you, Leah,
for that great breakfast.

1374
01:47:38,992 --> 01:47:40,094
You're very welcome.

1375
01:47:41,095 --> 01:47:42,264
He's glad you're here.

1376
01:47:43,863 --> 01:47:44,899
We all are.

1377
01:47:45,532 --> 01:47:47,935
Just don't break
his heart again.

1378
01:47:49,135 --> 01:47:50,772
I need you to follow through.

1379
01:47:52,739 --> 01:47:53,774
Yes, ma'am.

1380
01:47:55,242 --> 01:47:56,878
That's my intention.

1381
01:48:07,654 --> 01:48:08,657
Come in.

1382
01:48:10,992 --> 01:48:12,091
Hi, Mike.

1383
01:48:12,093 --> 01:48:13,691
How you doing?

1384
01:48:13,693 --> 01:48:15,263
- I'm healing up pretty good, sir.
- Good.

1385
01:48:16,096 --> 01:48:17,264
Go ahead, have a seat.

1386
01:48:20,367 --> 01:48:22,767
I hear there's something
you want to tell me.

1387
01:48:22,769 --> 01:48:26,107
Yes, sir. I know you're busy,
so I'll get right to it.

1388
01:48:29,910 --> 01:48:31,880
Before the attack, I...

1389
01:48:33,247 --> 01:48:37,716
I should've been more honest about some
of the things that I was dealing with.

1390
01:48:37,718 --> 01:48:40,854
The concussions,
the... pills.

1391
01:48:43,991 --> 01:48:45,193
I let you down, sir.

1392
01:48:47,728 --> 01:48:48,797
You're damn right.

1393
01:48:50,398 --> 01:48:53,766
Why did you think you
couldn't come to me with this

1394
01:48:53,768 --> 01:48:55,636
after all we've been through?

1395
01:48:56,136 --> 01:48:59,674
I don't know, sir. You know how
I feel about the job, and I...

1396
01:49:00,407 --> 01:49:02,611
I didn't want anyone
to take that away from me.

1397
01:49:03,978 --> 01:49:05,880
But that is no excuse.

1398
01:49:08,815 --> 01:49:10,385
You know,
someone said to me once...

1399
01:49:11,986 --> 01:49:14,022
it's better sometimes
knowing when to quit...

1400
01:49:14,956 --> 01:49:18,727
instead of lying to yourself and hurting
the ones you care about the most.

1401
01:49:19,859 --> 01:49:21,662
I'm not gonna
let that happen again.

1402
01:49:24,165 --> 01:49:26,100
I'm here to offer
my resignation, sir.

1403
01:49:49,090 --> 01:49:50,125
Mike...

1404
01:49:54,327 --> 01:49:57,965
it's our moments of struggle
that define us.

1405
01:49:59,767 --> 01:50:02,433
How we handle them
is what matters.

1406
01:50:02,435 --> 01:50:04,272
Like I said
in the hospital...

1407
01:50:05,038 --> 01:50:07,942
I'm still alive
because you didn't quit.

1408
01:50:08,575 --> 01:50:12,212
If you choose to do so now,
now that's up to you.

1409
01:50:13,313 --> 01:50:15,382
But I still want you
for director.

1410
01:50:17,785 --> 01:50:18,853
If you want it.

1411
01:50:26,292 --> 01:50:27,728
No more secrets.

1412
01:50:34,234 --> 01:50:35,469
No more secrets, sir.

1413
01:50:39,072 --> 01:50:40,107
Good.

1414
01:50:41,274 --> 01:50:42,410
Very good.

1415
01:50:49,082 --> 01:50:50,184
Thank you, sir.

1416
01:51:12,105 --> 01:51:15,039
You know, that's a good
thing you got off those pills

1417
01:51:15,041 --> 01:51:17,075
and you got
your physical done.

1418
01:51:17,077 --> 01:51:20,348
But you got a whole lot
of shit going on upstairs.

1419
01:51:20,814 --> 01:51:23,448
You know, the stuff
we've been through,

1420
01:51:23,450 --> 01:51:26,220
it sits up there
in the top of your head

1421
01:51:27,287 --> 01:51:29,221
like it's going to explode.

1422
01:51:29,223 --> 01:51:31,893
If you don't deal with it,
it'll eat you up.

1423
01:51:32,827 --> 01:51:34,062
Seriously, Dad?

1424
01:51:35,295 --> 01:51:37,495
You're telling me that I have
to take care of my upstairs?

1425
01:51:37,497 --> 01:51:41,600
- Yup.
- You're like one level off of the Unabomber.

1426
01:51:41,602 --> 01:51:43,468
Tell you what,

1427
01:51:43,470 --> 01:51:45,236
you wanna help me
get my shit together?

1428
01:51:45,238 --> 01:51:46,273
Yeah.

1429
01:51:46,773 --> 01:51:49,074
So, how about
you come with me?

1430
01:51:49,076 --> 01:51:50,478
We get un-fucked together.

1431
01:51:51,010 --> 01:51:52,479
Where are we going?

1432
01:51:53,613 --> 01:51:55,580
This place my doctor's
sending me to.

1433
01:51:55,582 --> 01:51:57,484
It's supposed
to rebalance your brain.

1434
01:51:58,318 --> 01:51:59,821
Oh, shit.

1435
01:52:02,456 --> 01:52:06,325
Our goal here is to increase
your powers of control.

1436
01:52:06,327 --> 01:52:10,094
All of your negative energy melts
away in the zero gravity tank

1437
01:52:10,096 --> 01:52:13,865
while activating
your core feelings of love

1438
01:52:13,867 --> 01:52:15,267
and centeredness,

1439
01:52:15,269 --> 01:52:17,436
keeping your mind
dreamily alert

1440
01:52:17,438 --> 01:52:19,908
just above
the portal of sleep.

1441
01:52:20,774 --> 01:52:23,812
We call this threshold
"theta state."

1442
01:52:28,114 --> 01:52:30,852
- Hey... let's give it a try.
- Ah.

1443
01:52:32,886 --> 01:52:33,921
Come on.

1444
01:52:34,621 --> 01:52:38,258
- Okay. All right. Fine.
- All right.

1445
01:52:43,630 --> 01:52:44,998
Oh.

1446
01:52:47,501 --> 01:52:48,837
Hey, this is all right.

1447
01:52:50,970 --> 01:52:52,272
Ohh.

1448
01:52:55,408 --> 01:52:57,276
What? Wait! Hold it!

1449
01:52:57,278 --> 01:52:58,977
Okay, okay,
get me outta here!

1450
01:52:58,979 --> 01:53:00,445
No fucking way!

1451
01:53:00,447 --> 01:53:02,614
- Turn the lights on!
- Sorry, Dad.

1452
01:53:02,616 --> 01:53:05,486
And you thought this was
gonna be a bonding experience?

1453
01:53:06,153 --> 01:53:07,485
Oh.

1454
01:53:07,487 --> 01:53:09,022
I'm gonna pee in here.

1455
01:53:09,346 --> 01:53:14,346

00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:44,210
The other day I was watching
one of those travel shows on PBS,

3
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,838
- it was all about Ireland.
- Ooh.

4
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,691
I would be interested.

5
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,693
- It's so beautiful.
- Mmm-hmm.

6
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:54,054
And anyway, they were showing
videos of people doing that Riverdance.

7
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,407
- Oh, yeah. Yes.
- Do you remember that?

8
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,932
It's so weird.

9
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,435
It's like their bodies are so straight

10
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:03,897
and then their legs, like, go crazy.

11
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,250
The upper half is straight
and the bottom half...

12
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,318
Then the bottom is like...

13
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,405
- You like that, huh, Sarah?
- Yeah.

14
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,033
- They probably are so strong.
- Mmm-hmm.

15
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:18,745
I should like it
because I'm Irish, but I'm not a big fan.

16
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,790
- Have you ever done DNANU?
- No.

17
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,792
You know, it's that kit where you...

18
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,921
spit in a tube and you send it away
and they can tell you your heritage.

19
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,965
Don't you have to, like,
prick your own blood?

20
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,133
No, you don't give blood.

21
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,886
You send it away and they give you
the results back so fast.

22
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,722
And, you know, I told you I'm Irish,
which I knew about.

23
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:41,309
So I found out I'm 96% Irish,

24
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,939
Welsh, and then I'm 3% Finland,

25
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,358
Northwest Russia,

26
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:52,153
and then 1% Senegal, Gambia.

27
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,155
- Do you know where that is?
- Mmm-mmm.

28
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,323
West Africa.

29
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:58,243
- What?
- I'm from West Africa!

30
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,537
- Can you believe it?
- That's crazy!

31
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,499
- You should do it.
- Wow! I would try that.

32
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,583
Yeah.

33
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,094
I don't really know anything
about my family,

34
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,421
but people have said that I look Irish.

35
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,506
You look very Irish.

36
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,757
- You think so?
- Yeah.

37
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,552
Well, maybe we're Irish sisters.

38
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:20,598
Maybe we're Irish... West African sisters.

39
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,355
Yeah, I would try that for sure.

40
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,905
So, these are the acrylic paints
that we're carrying right now,

41
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,991
and these are all of our tempera paints.

42
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:41,327
I would suggest, for a classroom setting,
always going with the tempera paint.

43
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,662
The acrylic is beautiful,

44
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,331
and honestly, they're both water-based,
they're both nontoxic.

45
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,417
And, like, what's his name?

46
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,169
- His name is Ryan.
- Ryan?

47
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,336
Yeah.

48
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,384
The clean-up with acrylic...
I mean, it dries beautifully, it's...

49
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,304
like, with a nice gloss to it,
but tempera's my favorite.

50
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,722
He asked me out on a date.

51
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,348
We... We have this little joke

52
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,976
where we, like, write everything
on Post-it Notes to each other,

53
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:09,272
so he put a little note on my locker
asking me if I wanted to go out with him.

54
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,110
The consistency now is really more, like,
kind of a pudding,

55
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:18,448
but if you just add a little bit of water,
it would be like a heavy cream.

56
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,742
Did you just,
like, find him and show him,

57
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,721
- and tell him yeah? Or, like...
- I wrote it on a little note.

58
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,015
- You wrote him back, put it on his locker?
- Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

59
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,721
Go ahead and just...
start her in a circle.

60
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,307
Yeah. Keep going.

61
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,184
Nice.

62
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,075
Make a wider circle. Bring her out a bit.

63
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,730
Yeah.

64
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,733
Give you some more room
to move like that. Nice.

65
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,752
<i>It was really good riding today.</i>

66
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,322
- <i>Oh, thanks.
- Uh-huh.</i>

67
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,116
<i>I just think you wanna
keep thinking about your form,</i>

68
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,409
you know...

69
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,287
- Oh.
- And, uh, your confidence.

70
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,623
When you're confident, Willow's confident.

71
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:12,168
She's a really intuitive girl.
She can feel your energy, you know...

72
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,836
- Yeah.
- ...so you wanna kind of

73
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,505
really be in tune with her.

74
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,215
I noticed you looking down a lot.

75
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,738
Really wanna keep your eyes up
and look to where you're going.

76
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,262
It's gonna be so important
when you get to jumps and...

77
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,223
Oh, well, I'm riding Western,
so I'm not gonna be doing jumps.

78
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:29,519
Well, Willow was trained English.
I used to ride her English.

79
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,229
I'm just gonna stay Western with her.

80
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,981
She really enjoys that style.

81
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,541
You might enjoy it, too.

82
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:37,986
- I think, um, my mom's here.
- To have that versatility would be good.

83
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,195
I'm sorry. I'm gonna go.

84
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,281
- Okay. Okay. Bye!
- Uh, bye!

85
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,820
<i>Ecchymosis indicates a struggle.</i>

86
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:21,903
<i>Poor girl.</i>

87
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,449
<i>Are you serious?</i>

88
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,242
<i>What? It gives me the heebie-jeebies.</i>

89
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,452
<i>The heebie-jeebies?</i>

90
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,247
<i>Darren, you literally
just vanquished the demon Scox</i>

91
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,417
<i>in a dirty gas station bathroom,
and this is too much for you?</i>

92
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,501
<i>That was different.</i>

93
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,837
<i>Different how?
And who says "heebie-jeebies"?</i>

94
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,631
<i>Fine. Sorry. Jeez. I forgot we're not
supposed to have feelings.</i>

95
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,678
<i>Proceed. Go. Go ahead.</i>

96
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,725
<i>Bingo.</i>

<i>Mark of Hades.</i>

98
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,149
- Hey, Sarah.
- Hey.

99
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,778
What's this? <i>Purgatory?</i>

100
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,030
Yeah. Just unwinding after work.

101
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,366
I'm making an anklet.

102
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,575
Nice.

103
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,828
Hey, Brian's new roommate is single.

104
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,248
Maybe we could all go out sometime?

105
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,001
Maybe.

106
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,046
All right. Have fun.

107
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,129
You, too.

108

<i>They drain the vic's life force.</i>

<i>Come on, give me a hand.</i>

110
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,144
<i>I knew it.</i>

111

112
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,338
<i>She must have been working for Dee.</i>

113
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,526
<i>The question is, who's Dee working for?</i>

114
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,776
Sarah?

115
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:08,738
Sarah?

116
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,324
Sorry.

117
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,061
Happy birthday!

118
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,312
Joan!

119
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,084
- You didn't!
- I did!

120
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,460
Oh!

121
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,759
- Oh, I can't wait to try it.
- Yeah.

122
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,683
So, what are you gonna do tonight
to celebrate?

123
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,055
Mmm...

124
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,932
I think, probably, I'll just...

125
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,059
go out with some friends
from my Zumba class.

126
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,730
You deserve to have fun.

127
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,190
Thanks, Joan.

128
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,867
Hello, Great Lengths, this is Joan.

129
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,118
Hello?

130
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:22,913
Hello?

131
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,975
- Okay. Not the...
- No.

132
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,935
- I know.
- I don't want any print.

133
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,145
Okay. Nothing too busy.

134
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,254
These are a lot of our warmer colors
over here.

135
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,673
- Reds and pinks, and...
- No, I already have red.

136
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,051
- I don't want red.
- ...purples... Or yellows.

137
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,137
- This is holiday, don't look at these.
- Sure. Okay.

138
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,599
Um... oranges,
we have a good orange over here.

139
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,600
Hmm.

140
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,352
It's like a marigold.

141
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,603
Not bad.

142
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,189
We have these.
We have these nice, um...

143
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,191
- Hmm.
- ...sort of peachy golds.

144
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,443
It's pretty, but the fabric wrinkles.

145
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,570
- It's too wrinkly?
- Yeah, it's too wrinkly. Yeah.

146
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,614
I... You know,
this fabric will never wrinkle.

147
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,383
It's darker. It's more of, like, a brick...

148
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,534
Well, you said no red. But...

149
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,078
Oh, this is the color.

150
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,039
Yeah, the peach. It has the right energy.

151
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,458
Colors have energy?

152
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,211
Oh, absolutely. All colors have energy.

153
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,546
And this is very protective.

154
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,714
- It is?
- Yeah.

155
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,383
It's good for my business, you know?

156
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,510
It puts my customers at ease.

157
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,761
Oh, cool.

158
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,098
You know, I have a tarot business,
I read cards.

159
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,100
Also, I read the Armenian cup.

160
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,811
Do you... have husband?

161
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:27,812
No.

162
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,563
- No boyfriend?
- Mmm-mmm.

163
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,607
No? You should come see me.

164
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,943
I'll give you discount. Here.

165
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,112
This is my card.

166
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,114
Oh, wow.

167
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,281
Go ahead. Smell it.

168
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,076
Mmm.

169
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,536
This is protective, too.

170
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,039
- Oh, cool. Thank you.
- Yes.

171
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,458
So, this one?

172
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,419
Yes. Eight yards.

173
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,547
Hello, Great Lengths, this is Joan.

174
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,298
Hello?

175
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,137
A little tighter circle.

176
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,680
There you go.

177
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,725
Keep your back straight.

178
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,643
You're kinda arched up a little bit.

179
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,353
- There you go.
- Posture.

180
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,896
That's pretty good form there.

181
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,791
How's it feel?
Like you know what you're doing,

182
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,817
or is that horse
still taking you for a ride?

183
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,736
Yeah, I think I've got her.

184
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,821
You... Oh, you think?

185
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,197
- I do.
- Oh, good.

186
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,408
- Whoa.
- There you go.

187
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,368
All right. We're done, Willow.

188
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,495
Good work.

189
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,624
- Hi.
- Oh, hey.

190
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,377
Hi, darling.

191
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,759
Hey, Emma, I noticed you were
a little distracted today.

192
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,093
- Here. I'll get that.
- Oh.

193
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,219
Just, uh...

194
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,971
Just wanted to remind you, uh,

195
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,199
how important it is to really
stay connected to Willow.

196
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,543
You know, when you're distracted,

197
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,244
- looking down, up, around...
- Yeah.

198
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,548
...that's when accidents happen.

199
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,831
I just got a text from my mom,
so I'm gonna...

200
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,607
Okay, just wanna... I'll take her tack off.

201
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,608
Okay, cool.

202
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,818
Okay. Happy birthday!

203
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,321
Happy birthday, beauty!

204
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,739
Look what I made you.

205
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,201
Look what I made you!

206
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,244
Is that so pretty?

207
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,830
Let's put that in your hair.

208
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,332
Let's see.

209
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,959
Let's get that right in there. Oh!

210
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,336
Isn't that nice?

211
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,837
- Sarah?
- You look so pretty.

212
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,130
Hi, Cheryl! Oh, Joe.

213
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,215
Hey.

214
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:23,135
I just made Willow this lanyard,
because we have the same birthday.

215
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,386
So, it's our birthday today.

216
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,097
- Oh. Okay.
- Yeah. Looks really cool.

217
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,684
Well, we don't wanna keep you.
Uh... so, uh, I can get her tack off.

218
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,770
- Oh, I don't mind.
- That's all right. I got it.

219
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:33,687
Go get some water.

220
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,981
You look a little thirsty.
Go treat yourself.

221
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,273
- Okay.
- Okay.

222
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,027
Happy birthday, Willow!

223
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,403
Okay. See ya.

224
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,782
Clap, tap! Clap, tap! Clap!

225
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,451
Here we go. We're gonna get sexy.
Are you ready?

226
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,703
Sex it up. Here we go.

227
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:53,707
Cha-cha, back, back, back.
Now, cha-cha, back, back, back.

228
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,084
Sexy! Come on.

229
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,211
Cha-cha-cha. You're sexy!

230
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,964
And Grapevine! High clap, low krump.

231
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,466
Here we go. Grapevine!

232
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,469
High clap, low krump. And we spank!

233
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,139
Very good! Yes!

234
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,891
Yes! Yes! Yes!

235
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,184
Very good!

236
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:28,868
- Hey, Julie.
- Hi!

237
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,077
Thanks for a great class.

238
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,763
- Oh, you did such a good job.
- Thank you.

239
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:32,787
Good energy.

240
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,499
So, what are you up to tonight?
Have anything going on?

241
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,502
No. I don't know.
Might hang out with some friends,

242
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,129
or... you know.

243
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,922
- Cool. Cool.
- Yeah.

244
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,718
Cool. Okay?
Well, I'll see you next week.

245
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,428
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- Okay. Bye!

246
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,312
<i>Please, Agatha.
Don't! It’s me. Darren.</i>

247
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,897
<i>Don't listen to him!
He's just another clone.</i>

248
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,815
<i>I'm Darren. The real Darren.</i>

249
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,191
<i>No, wait!</i>

250
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,194
<i>You're always ten minutes late,
even if there's no traffic.</i>

251
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,529
<i>You always eat dinner at 5:00.</i>

252
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,614
<i>Whenever you're nervous,</i>

253
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,532
<i>you get a cute little wrinkle
in your chin.</i>

254
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,660
<i>Did you just say I was cute?</i>

255
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,263
<i>I meant tiny. I didn't say cute.</i>

256
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,247
<i>I didn't mean cute. I... I meant tiny.</i>

257
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,931
<i>He's trying
to seduce you. He's an incubus clone!</i>

258
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,627
<i>Quick, Agatha, think!</i>

259
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,838
<i>- Damn it!
- Speak...</i>

260
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,216
<i>of the devil.</i>

261
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,887
<i>Hades. I should've known.</i>

262
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,013
<i>Mmm.</i>

263
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,349
<i>Ooh. Ticktock, doll.</i>

264
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,977
<i>You have one silver bullet,</i>

265
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,606
<i>two targets, and three seconds</i>

266
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,608
<i>until the prophecy shall be fulfilled.</i>

267
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,402
<i>Now, without further ado...</i>

268
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,528
Sarah. Hey.

269
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,322
<i>...let the games begin.</i>

270
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,239
Hey.

271
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,683
You're here. I thought you were
going out for your birthday.

272
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,244
Oh, those plans just fell through.

273
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,331
So you're just gonna hang around here,
make more anklets?

274
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,792
It's lanyard.

275
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,086
Hey.

276
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,299
We should do something. To celebrate.

277
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,134
It's okay. It's late.

278
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,511
Yeah. It is.

279
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,595
It's 8:30.

280
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,555
Come on, let's celebrate.

281
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,391
Why don't you text your roommate?

282
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,892
- Get him over here.
- Yeah.

283
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,776
Oh, well, he's probably busy,
though, tonight.

284
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:19,895
Text him.

285
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,522
Yeah.

286
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,858
This will be good.

287
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,568
- Yay!
- Okay.

288
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,071
Wanna get dressed?

289
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,158
Okay. I got options.

290
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,327
Oh. Uh, well, I sort of thought...

291
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,662
I could wear this.

292
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,247
Oh. Yeah.

293
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,457
I like the waist.

294
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,084
Let's go sexier.

295
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,086
Show off your body.
You never do that.

296
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,755
Um...

297
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:54,013
I have this dress that...
was my grandmother's.

298
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,639
Wow. It's really pretty.

299
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,224
I would hate to ruin it.

300
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,226
We might get messy tonight.

301
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,602
Okay.

302
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,981
Um, let's try something
more modern.

303
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,150
Maybe this?

304
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,985
Mmm...

305
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,113
- Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.

306
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,074
Okay.

307
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,618
Are these okay?

308
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,942
- Yeah. Those are great.
- Okay.

309
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,164
- Hey. Look at me. You look great.
- I look okay?

310
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,331
Yeah. No, you look perfect.

311
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,055
- Keep your bangs swept like that.
- Okay.

312
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,878
Hey.

313
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:26,837
What's up, man?

314
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,480
- Hey, what's up, man?
- How's it going?

315
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,049
Good, yeah. How are you?

316
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,568
- Good.
- He's super sweet.

317
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:35,054
- Thanks for inviting me.
- Sarah, Darren. Darren... that's Sarah.

318
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,430
- Oh.
- Hi.

319
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,639
- Hi.
- Uh, I'm Darren.

320
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,934
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you tell me?

321
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,563
I... I can't believe your name is Darren,
like <i>Purgatory.</i>

322
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,733
Oh, yeah. I mean, I haven't seen it,
but, yeah, I know of it.

323
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,420
It's, like, the main character's name.

324
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,839
- Maybe don't do that.
- It's, like, my favorite show.

325
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,114
Cool. Yeah.

326
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,366
- Do you want a drink?
- Yeah. No, that would be great.

327
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,451
We can smoke blunts, too.

328
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,871
Yeah, maybe I'll just start with the drink
and then see how that goes.

329
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,081
Okay.

330
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,373
All right. Here you go.

331
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,792
I really like your dress.

332
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,376
Oh.

333
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,753
I like your shirt.

334
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,631
Oh, thanks, it's a...
Well, it's a sweater.

335
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,007
It looks nice.

336
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,468
Thanks. Yeah, your dress is,
like, a really pretty color.

337
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,696
We don't have music.
We could listen to some of my music.

338
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,388
Yeah. Or... any music.

339
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,112
No, babe,
put your music on, it's so good.

340
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,016
Yeah, it's fire.

341
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,983
This is the fourth track now.

342
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,402
Yeah. Uh.

343
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,446
Yeah.
How many more tracks are there?

344
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:36,615
Twelve total.

345
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,700
That's why I'm calling it
"A Baker's Dozen."

346
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,160
It's a concept album.

347
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,664
Right. So, don't you mean 13?

348
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,916
Is there, like,
a bonus track or something?

349
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,877
No. "Baker's Dozen." Dozen's 12.

350
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,631
Yeah, it's a concept album...
once again, so...

351
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,217
I'm sorry, have you guys
ever been to a bakery?

352
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,762
Yeah. Duh.
Like, yes. We've been to a bakery.

353
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,808
Then you'd understand
a baker's dozen's 13.

354
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,143
It's a concept album.

355
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,537
Not talking about the album.

356
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,313
I'm talking about when you go
to the bakery and you order 12...

357
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,732
like, a dozen,
they give you the extra one

358
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,651
as, like, a treat. Like, you did good.

359
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,111
What bakery?

360
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,195
All bakeries.

361
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,865
Oh. I get what you're saying.
No, but that's semantics.

362
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,994
It's nice to, uh, be, like...
be out of my house and stuff,

363
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,829
and hanging out, and...

364
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,456
talking to, uh, a woman...

365
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,208
...again.

366
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,336
I feel like
I'm just starting to,

367
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,213
like, feel like myself again, you know?

368
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,634
It's like, when you're in a relationship,
like, everything is so dictated

369
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,970
by what your partner does, you know?

370
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,453
- Yeah.
- This is gonna sound weird,

371
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,599
but, like, my ex-girlfriend would...

372
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,517
like, pick out my clothes.

373
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,061
Yeah.

374
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,582
Like, if I would leave the room
wearing what I wanted to wear,

375
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,606
she would scream, like,

376
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,860
"Get back in there and, like,
put on the outfit I chose for you." And...

377
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:59,531
I, like, found myself wearing,
like, purple all the time.

378
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,284
And I had these,
like, brown leather bracelets.

379
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,454
I was like, "Why am I wearing, like,
ten brown leather bracelets?"

380
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,164
Like, I don't like jewelry.

381
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,807
Like, I didn't grow up wearing jewelry,

382
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,585
let alone, like,
brown leather and, like...

383
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,087
Like, she would never
call me her boyfriend.

384
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,798
Like, we dated for two and a half years,

385
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,443
and she would never
call me her boyfriend.

386
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,845
Like, I would go to her reunions
and meet her extended family and stuff,

387
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,264
and she'd be like,
"This is Darren, my friend."

388
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,183
Oh, my God.

389
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,310
I don't know. It just
really made me feel like shit.

390
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,312
Like, "I've been dating you for so..."

391
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,439

Hey, happy birthday.

- Um...
- Thanks.

447
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,440
Yeah. Thanks for letting me
share it with you.

448
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,817
I really liked that.

449
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,735
- Totally?
- Yeah.

450
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,781
Um... it was really nice to meet you.

451
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:29,908
You, too.

452
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,703
Hopefully I'll see you, uh, around?

453
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:34,787
Definitely.

454
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,791
All right. Bye.

455
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:38,875
Bye.

456
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,022
Whoa.

457
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:43,815
What the hell?

458
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:45,649
Yo.

459
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,743
Hey. Good morning.

460
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,454
Oh! Hey.

461
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,081
What's this?

462
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,709
Oh, you were wilding out.

463
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,336
Do you know what happened to the wall?

464
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,213
Those scratches?

465
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,716
I don't know.

466
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,560
Maybe call a handyman, get it fixed,
just before the landlord sees it.

467
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:13,720
Okay.

468
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,097
I'm sorry, I don't remember...

469
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,474
No. It's okay.

470
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,850
Just get it fixed.

471
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,395
Have a good day.

472
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,804
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

473
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,305
Remember me from, uh, last night?

474
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,766
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

475
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:00,934
I just came to get my car,

476
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,727
and I, uh, was thinking about you,

477
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,437
and wanted to see if I could, uh,

478
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,521
have your number,

479
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,900
and maybe I could take you on a date.

480
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,445
Yeah.

481
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,655
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

482
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,031
Yeah. Okay.

483
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:19,327
Whew. Okay, good. Yeah. Sorry, uh...
Do you wanna just put your number in?

484
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,912
- I'll put it in.
- Yeah. Sorry.

485
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,836
Nervous as hell, I don't really...
I haven't done that in a while, so...

486
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:24,708
Yeah.

487
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,459
And everything's, like, all online now,

488
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,253
so it's so nice to meet someone in person.

489
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,064
Like, there's something
so exciting about you,

490
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,888
and I was thinking about you,
and...

491
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,693
- ...seeing the dress again, I'm like...
- Oh.

492
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,844
It's just as pretty, uh, today.

493
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,762
So... Yeah. Um...

494
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,348
Okay, so... I'll just...
call or text you, or...

495
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,434
- Okay. Yeah.
- Okay. Okay.

496
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,312
So, um, okay. So, then I guess, uh...

497
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,356
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

498
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,691
Okay. Thank you for this. Bye.

499
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,214
- Okay. Bye.
- Sarah. Bye.

500
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,862
<i>I love this gradient yarn.</i>

501
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,030
Oh, yeah.

502
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,949
- It's so cool.
- It's so pretty!

503
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,368
So, did you hang out with
your Zumba friends last night?

504
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,203
Mmm-hmm.

505
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:06,499
Yeah, everyone just came over
and we sort of had a little party.

506
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,209
Oh.

507
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,253
And I... met a guy.

508
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,297
Sarah!

509
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,507
What?

510
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,717
Yeah, he just came over

511
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,012
because he's roommates with
my roommate's boyfriend, Brian,

512
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,097
so he just came over with him.

513
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,099
And we just...

514
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,018
hung out all night, and...

515
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:29,606
and talked and talked and talked,
and, um... he's so nice.

516
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,106
What's his name?

517
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,402
His name is Darren. Like, from <i>Purgatory.</i>

518
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,071
Interesting.

519
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,280
And then...

520
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:41,034
Well, he actually...
He came back over this morning

521
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,620
and asked me out on a date-date.

522
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,372
- Like, a real date.
- Whoa.

523
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,707
This is serious. He really likes you.

524
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,002
I'm happy for you, Sarah.

525
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:59,511
Oh, no, they sent
these weird agate chunks again.

526
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:02,472
Oh, I don't like those agates.
Nobody's gonna buy them.

527
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,391
I told them "round."

528
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:10,063
Oh. Oh, no. Oh. Joan!

529
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,439
Oh, no.

530
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,608
- Oh, I'm sorry, it got...
- Oh, my goodness!

531
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,732
Oh, here. I have a tissue.

532
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:18,029
Here, take this.
Now keep your head forward, it'll help.

533
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,447
- Oh, forward?
- No, forward.

534
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,532
It'll stop the bleeding.

535
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,033
Okay. I'm sorry.

536
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,578
I think I'm probably just
dehydrated from drinking.

537
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,623
Poor guy.

538
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,550
Great Lengths, this is Joan,
can I help you?

539
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:42,178
Hello? Hello?

540
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,556
Take another selfie, huh?

541
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,516
To Satico, god of technology.

542
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,477
13,000 years at the center
of a polar orbit.

543
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:54,399
While I wait for someone to stop him...

544
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,328
- Hi!
- Hi!

545
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:11,124
- How are you doing?
- Good. How are you?

546
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,793
Good. Thank you for coming.
It makes her so happy.

547
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,212
It makes me happy, too.

548
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,213
How you doing?

549
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,465
Good! Everything's good.

550
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,548
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

551
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,968
Heather, Sarah's here!

552
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,052
Coming!

553
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,096
So, she had a really good week,
no seizures,

554
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,974
but if anything happens,
she's got her meds in her pocket,

555
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,769
and, um, yeah, just text me or whatever.

556
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,645
Okay. We'll probably just take a walk.

557
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,190
Oh. Fun.

558
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,108
Oh. Hi!

559
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,903
- Sarah! Hi.
- Hey. Hi.

560
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,946
You look so pretty!

561
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,783
You look pretty.
Your hair is getting so long.

562
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:45,950
Thanks. I'm growing it out.

563
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,952
Um...

564
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:49,996
I made you this.

565
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,956
- You did?
- It's an anklet.

566
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,668
So, your mom said
you got a new job at the market?

567
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,129
Well, it's actually this...
It's at the same market.

568
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,840
- Mmm-hmm.
- But, um, I was so excited to tell you.

569
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,968
Um, they actually moved me
to the bakery.

570
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,512
That's so cool!

571
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:06,679
Thanks.

572
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:07,680
Are you baking?

573
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,933
Yeah, well, they're having...

574
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:16,815
Because...

575
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,069
It's because I'm so friendly.

576
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,571
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

577
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,489
Thank you.

578
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:25,907
That's cool.

579
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,118
Do you have a boyfriend?

580
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,999
Yeah. Kind of.

581
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,960
I kind of have a new boyfriend.

582
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,212
- You do?
- Yeah, his name is Darren.

583
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,588
He's, like, really nice.

584
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,966
Oh, my gosh.
That's so cool.

585
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,303
What color is his hair?

586
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,348
It's brown.

587
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,599
Just like Willow?

588
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,478
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, kind of.

589
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,413
Do you have a boyfriend?

590
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,835
- Bye.
- Bye!

591
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,004
- I love you.
- I love you.

592
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,715
- It was so fun.
- It was so fun.

593
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,092
Okay. Thanks. Come by again, okay?

594
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,529
- You gotta come visit me in the bakery.
- It means so much to her.

595
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:32,140
Okay, yes. Definitely, I will. Bye.

596
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,601
- Bye, sweetie. Take care.
- Bye!

597
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,999
Jeez, you scared me.

598
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:24,085
I crashed at Brian's, his power went out.
My phone died.

599
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,045
My alarm didn't go off, so I'm fucked.

600
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,881
I thought you were here.
I... I heard you guys last night.

601
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,426
What? No.
We were at Brian's all night.

602
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,779
- I heard your voices.
- Did you call the handyman about this yet?

603
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,055
- No, not yet.
- I need you to do that. Please?

604
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,807
Okay.

605
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,642
Bye!

606
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,513
<i>Police department.
How can I help you?</i>

607
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,790
<i>Um, yes, hi.
I'm calling to report a stolen vehicle.</i>

608
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,560
<i>What's the make and model of your vehicle?</i>

609
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:08,337
It's a 1991 Volvo 240. It's gold.

610
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,548
Um, the license plate is...

611
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,885
GCQ-4457.

612
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,094
It has a sunroof.

613
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,971
I had the club locked on it.

614
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,681
I don't know how this could've happened.

615
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,118
- Hey, can you give me a ride to work?
- I'm late!

616
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,271
Mmm... Yeah, the...

617
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,482
Oh. Shit. Sorry, um...

618
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,858
Can you hold on one sec?

619
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,735
Hello?

00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,696
Hello?

<i>Hello? Sarah?
Can... Can you hear me?</i>

622
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,827
Hi. Yeah. Gary?

623
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:43,071
<i>I just got... I have this hands-free thing,
I didn't even know if it would work.</i>

<i>Listen, I just got a call from a tow yard,</i>

625
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,543
<i>they have your car.</i>

626
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,420
Oh, my God. That is great news.

627
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,090
I'm just on the other line
reporting it stolen.

628
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,925
<i>I guess it's still under my name.</i>

629
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,885
<i>I can come pick you up.
You wanna go get it?</i>

630
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,304
Yes. Gary, thank you so much.

631
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,263
<i>Okay. Uh, yeah.</i>

632

- </i>Okay. Thank you.

Oh, shoot.

00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,779
- Hey!
- Hi.

00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,239
Hi.

637
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,825
Hey, sweetie. How are you?

638
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,203
Sorry. I don't know what happened.

639
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,705
The gates were closed
and I locked the club and everything...

640
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,873
Don't even worry about it.

641
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,625
It's all taken care of. You're good.

642
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,710
- And, uh... here.
- Oh.

643
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,420
Happy belated birthday.

644
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,842
I didn't know what to get you,
so I figured this way you can...

645
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,510
get whatever you want,

646
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,887
- and get yourself something nice.
- Oh, Gary.

647
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,347
- You know...
- Thank... Thank you.

648
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,849
You have it. Sure.

649
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,560
And I feel bad, I... I'm sorry.

650
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,895
I haven't really been around lately.
It's been...

651
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,438
just, you know, a bit crazy with...

652
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,232
- with everything, and...
- It's okay.

653
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,610
No. It's not, but... How have you been?

654
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,114
Yeah, I've been good.
I've been, um, going by to see Mom

655
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,908
and making sure
the grave's all clean and nice.

656
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,576
Nice.

657
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,165
Let's, uh...
Let's go take care of this, okay?

658
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,249
Yeah.

659
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,545
You were really, really lucky.
The car was blocking traffic.

660
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,964
They left it in the middle of the street
with no gas.

661
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,008
Where was it?

662
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:18,926
By the water place.

663
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,261
The water place?

664
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,197
- The tanks. The water...
- Yeah, yeah.

665
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,381
- Water plant.
- Yellow tanks.

666
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,892
- Oh, those tanks.
- It was green, but yeah. They'll...

667
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:28,227
But you know, I don't think
this car was stolen,

668
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,730
because the key was in the ignition
and it was turned right.

669
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,869
So I believe
they just left the car running

670
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,150
and they ran out of gas.

671
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,067
Detective.

672
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,711
- Gonna need your signature.
- You know,

673
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,988
I saw that on, uh, <i>Columbo</i> once.

674
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,511
Sign right here.

675
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,119
All right.
Really appreciate the call.

676
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,806
By the way, we put some gas in it.
It's included on the bill.

677
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,100
- Oh, okay. Thank you.
- Let me give you the receipt.

678
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,168
Okay, thank you. Here, sweetie.

679
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,588
Thanks, Gary. I really appreciate it.

680
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:56,671
Of course.

681
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,091
- I'm so sorry, I... It's weird.
- No. Hey.

682
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,302
Car looks like it's in one piece.

683
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,887
- You're okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

684
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,889
You need anything?
Do you need any more money?

685
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,933
No, no. No. Thank you.

686
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,809
- You tell me if you do.
- Okay.

687
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,020
Hey, Gary...

688
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:17,944
How old was Mom when she...
started acting like Helen?

689
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,029
She never acted like Helen. No.

690
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:23,616
Helen was... you know,
she was talking to walls. That...

691
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,411
Your mom was... She struggled.
She struggled sometimes.

692
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,248
Things became a little too much, you know?

693
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,416
Why? Are you...

694
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,877
No. No. No.

695
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,170
Thanks. Love you.

696
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,507
Yeah. Hey. Happy belated birthday.

697
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,467
All right, sweetie.

698
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,683
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

699
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,851
Hyah, boy.

700
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,853
- Oh. Hey, Joe!
- Hyah!

701
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,315
Oh, hey there.

702
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,401
So, Emma's not taking Willow out today?

703
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,778
No, she's out of town. Out of town. Hyah!

704
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,154
You want me to take her out?

705
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,240
No. No. We're good. We're good.

706
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,574
- I mean, I'm here.
- Hyah!

707
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,035
I don't mind.
Happy to give her some exercise.

708
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,959
You know what,
it's kind of an insurance thing,

709
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,789
and she's not your horse anymore.

710
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:15,835
Well, I'll just go by and... say hi
and give her a little brush.

711
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,004
Yeah. Okay.

712
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,131
Okay. Thanks, Joe.

713
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,842
Okay. Hyah!

714
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,638
Hi, Willow.

715
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,224
Hi, beauty.

716
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,186
You gonna get a little rest today?

717
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,032
- Hey, Joe?
- Hey.

718
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,993
- Willow's not wearing the...
- Oh! Wanna step outside, please? Thanks.

719
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:53,122
Sorry. Um... Willow's not wearing
that lanyard I made her.

720
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,374
- Do you know what happened to it?
- What's that, now?

721
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,792
Remember, a couple of days ago,

722
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,753
I... I made her that lanyard
for our birthdays?

723
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,338
But I... I can't find it.

724
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,632
You know, I don't know what that...
I'm sure it'll turn up, though.

725
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,219
Okay.

726
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,430
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah, all right.

727
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,005
What the fuck?

728
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,762
Hi. Sorry. I think I was sleepwalking,
'cause my mom used to say

729
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,972
that I have an overactive imagin...

730
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,183
Good night.

731
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,262
<i>Ah, I took her for a walk.</i>

732
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:29,713
<i>I distinctly remember the clock saying
it was 6:00 p.m.,</i>

733
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,883
<i>and saying hey to my neighbor Glenn
who was on his porch.</i>

734
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,678
<i>And this was in the winter,
so, you know, it was...</i>

735
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:36,863
<i>it was dark outside already.</i>

736
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:40,474
<i>I came home, fed her, looked out
the window, and bam, it was light outside.</i>

737
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,352
<i>I looked at the clock again
and it said 5:00 p.m.</i>

738
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,353
<i>Wow.</i>

739
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:48,232
<i>Yeah. In my book, I interview
several people with similar incidents</i>

740
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,401
<i>that don't jive
with our notions of reality.</i>

741
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,777
<i>So, aliens?</i>

742
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,738
<i>That's certainly one explanation.
Alien abductions.</i>

743
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,324
<i>Accidentally slipping
into parallel universes.</i>

744
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,635
<i>Thought control.</i>

745
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,542
30% employee discount just for you.

746
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,335
Thank you.

747
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,880
You're welcome. So, uh, Shannon's
not here yet, but before she gets in,

748
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,604
would you mind taking a look at the glue?

749
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,801
She did it yesterday,
but it's just a little...

750
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,762
Are... Are you okay?

751
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,641
I don't know. Um...

752
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,561
I just
haven't been sleeping very well.

753
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,479
That's too bad.

754
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:30,024
Yeah, I've been having,
like, really weird dreams.

755
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,483
Really? About what?

756
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,236
Um... I don't know. Like...

757
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:38,115
Like, I've been seeing the same people
over and over again.

758
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:43,329
And, like, these strange places
I've never been before.

759
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:48,250
And I don't know how to describe it,
it just feels really weird.

760
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,127
And, like, really scary.

761
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,712
That's horrible.

762
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:55,716
And, like... I've been having,
like, weird things with time.

763
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,052
Weird things with time?

764
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:02,014
Like, finding myself places
and I don't know how I got there.

765
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,808
What... What does that mean, exactly?

766
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,394
Like, last night, I was gone for,
like, 25 minutes,

767
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,718
and when I looked at the clock,

768
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,856
it showed that
only two minutes had passed.

769
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:14,526
So, like, I did some research online,
and people talk about, um,

770
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,738
carbon monoxide poisoning,
but I just don't think it's that.

771
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:22,159
And then they also talk about, um,
alien abductions. Do you believe in that?

772
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,452
Mmm...

773
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,497
No, I... Not really.

774
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,623
No?

775
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:32,002
Do you think this sounds similar to
some of the stuff your mom went through?

776
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,505
No.

777
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,674
Maybe you should talk to a doctor, Sarah.

778
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,426
You know, get a professional opinion.

779
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,221
- What do you think?
- Maybe.

780
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,808
Joan!
That's the guy from my dream.

781
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,518
Really?

782
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,644
Yes!

783
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,318
Turn it all off.
It'll be the Dark Ages again!

784
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:57,945
"Santiaguez."

785
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,507
We'll all be gone except for those
that are Sectilians that are...

786
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:05,994
that are in cahoots with Satico Satellite!
God of technology!

787
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,206
Sits at the right hand of Zeus!

788
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:11,583
Powering all your electronic devices!

789
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:15,504
Light bulbs! Email!
Internet! Satico Satellite...

790
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:18,257
Tap. Good. Tap. Great! Tap.

791
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,175
Excellent! Good. Very good!

792
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,886
Yes! Sweat out those margaritas!

793
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,515
Let's cha-cha!
Back, back, back, and cha-cha!

794
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,767
Back, back, back, and pump, pump.

795
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:33,355
Double. Now, pump, pump. Double.
Good! Keep pulling! Yes!

796
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:36,650
Match that hip to your fist.
Very good.

797
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,068
Okay.

798
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,661
Hi. Can I help you?

799
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,098
Do you remember me?

800
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,768
Have you used us before?

801
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,482
I just wanted to talk to you.

802
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:21,904
Okay. About... plumbing? HVAC?

803
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:23,654
Plumbing.

804
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:26,283
Kitchen? Bathroom?

805
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:27,910
Kitchen.

806
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,037
Pipes. I need new pipes.

807
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:32,873
All right. Pipes.

808
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,666
Is that expensive?

809
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,503
Depends on the work.
It's hard to tell until I check it out.

810
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:43,050
Oh, you could come and check it out?
I have money.

811
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:46,512
Oh, well, that's usually
not necessary until I'm...

812
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,156
- Here.
- ...at the job. Oh, okay.

813
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,140
Yeah. Sure.

814
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,142
Great. So you'll come
check it out tonight?

815
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:55,020
Well, we're almost closed
and dispatch is gone, so, um...

816
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,898
I can probably squeeze you in
in the morning, though.

817
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,085
In the morning. Tomorrow morning. Great.
So you'll come tomorrow morning?

818
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:03,362
You really
want those pipes, huh?

819
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:04,445
Yeah.

820
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:10,077
All righty. I'll... just need
some information.

821
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,160
Your name?

822
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,581
Agatha Kaine.

823
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,214
- Okay.
- Tomorrow, then?

824
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:24,925
Yeah. Just need your address
and phone number.

825
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,509
Okay.

826
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,161
<i>One... Mississippi.</i>

827
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:55,998
<i>Please, don't.</i>

828
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,625
<i>Two... Mississippi.</i>

829
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,628
<i>Listen to your heart, Agatha.</i>

830
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:08,093
<i>Three... Mississippi.</i>

831
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,153
Clones.

832
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:56,433
Hey, Miss Kaine. I'm Tom
from Santiaguez Plumbing.

833
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:58,559
Oh.

834
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,857
Yeah. It's good we're replacing
this old galvanized pipe.

835
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,151
It's got tons of sclerosis.

836
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,736
Oh. Those are better?

837
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,488
Yeah. Copper's the best.

838
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:14,618
So, like, are you friends with
any of the people you work with?

839
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:17,829
I don't know.

840
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,832
We get beers, like,
once a month or something.

841
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,919
What about the guy
who made me this appointment?

842
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,922
That would be Ron. One of the owners.

843
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:29,925
He's one of the owners.

844
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,344
Does he work every day?

845
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,888
Yeah. Yeah,
he's pretty much there all day.

846
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:40,203
Has he ever told you about
anything weird that's happened to him?

847
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,853
That's like...

848
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,066
What? What is this? What's happening?

849
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,985
Hi. Nothing.

850
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,548
- What is going on?
- Nothing.

851
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:51,488
What is he... Hi. What are you doing?

852
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:54,282
He's just replacing the pipes
because we needed new pipes,

853
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,409
our pipes are really old.

854
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,773
- You're replacing the pipes?
- Yeah, and I paid for them!

855
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:01,873
We're renting. I asked you to fix
the scratches on the wall.

856
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,208
We don't need new plumbing.

857
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,795
Mmm. Can you just
put it back how it was?

858
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:11,299
Miss Kaine, I... I don't know if
I'm authorized to do that, I mean...

859
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,259
Miss Kaine?

860
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,946
- Plus, they're all gunked up...
- What did you call her? What?

861
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,014
Agatha Kaine?

862
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:19,725
- Listen.
- Are you using an alias?

863
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,685
Listen. Everything's fine.

864
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:24,122
He's gonna finish doing the floors,
and I already paid for it,

865
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,873
and he's gonna put the floor back
the way it was.

866
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,709
And I... I even called the guy
about the walls,

867
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:31,570
and he said he can't come until next week,
so, it's... it's all taken care of.

868
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,533
Fine. This is fucking insane.

869
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:43,415
So, is Ron working tonight?

870
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,239
Okay. Here we go, now.

871
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:05,617
It's gonna sting just a little bit.

872
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,703
And... And there we go.

873
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:12,499
All done. Great. I think we got it.

874
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,167
- You did great.
- Oh, good.

875
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,460
- Thank you.
- Okay.

876
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:21,007
Um... And if...
If I should get another nosebleed,

877
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,010
should I lean my head back
or should I lean it forward?

878
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,428
Yeah, always forward.

879
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,138
Because if you lean your head back,

880
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:30,475
then the blood is gonna flow
down the back of your throat,

881
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,269
and then you'll get nauseous and throw up,

882
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:34,354
and you don't want that to happen.

883
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:36,648
- Okay.
- Okay? Good.

884
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:41,236
Um... And I've been having
a little trouble sleeping,

885
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:43,571
'cause I've been having
these really weird dreams,

886
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:45,615
and I've been kind of scared
to go to sleep.

887
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,535
- Uh-huh.
- And now I have some bruises on my body.

888
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,245
Do you know what that could be from?

889
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,374
Well, um, you know,

890
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,626
a bruise like that
could really be from anything.

891
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,838
You might've bumped into something,
even if you didn't know that you did.

892
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:02,882
Uh, you know what would be
a good idea, Sarah, for you?

893
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,969
I think you should get, uh,
some blood work done through your GP,

894
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:09,931
um, and ask them to test for, uh, anemia.

895
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:12,600
Um... Partly because of the, uh...

896
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:14,811
the nosebleeds you've been having.

897
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,146
- Mmm-hmm.
- And, um,

898
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:17,981
if there's any coagulation problem,

899
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,751
that could... that could tell you
something about the bruises as well.

900
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:21,609
Okay?

901
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,361
- Okay.
- All right. Okay. Good.

902
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:28,325
Is there also a test, um,
like, to see if I'm a clone?

903
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,452
Uh, I'm sorry?

904
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:33,580
Um, just a test to see
if I'm, like, a clone?

905
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,541
A clone?

906
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:39,794
Well, I guess the one way
to do that is we'd, uh,

907
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:41,671
take your DNA test,

908
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:45,258
and we'd take the DNA test
of the other person,

909
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,177
and if they match,

910
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,137
then you've got a clone.

911
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:51,890
That's the only way I know.

912
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:55,352
Well, just 'cause I've been watching
season five of <i>Purgatory</i>

913
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,771
where Darren becomes a clone, and...

914
00:55:58,313 --> 00:55:59,939
it just sort of got me thinking

915
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,484
that, like, I look so much
like my grandma,

916
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:06,446
and I have all these old photos of her,
and, like, we look exactly the same,

917
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:09,616
and I can even sort of
make the face she makes in the photos,

918
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,786
and, like... uh...
So, that would make sense,

919
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:17,165
'cause... I didn't know her.
She was gone before I was born.

920
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:18,917
So maybe they would have
needed her body

921
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,212
to, like, recycle it into me
if I was a clone of her.

922
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:25,965
And I don't know who...
would be doing it, like...

923
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:29,219
it could be the government,
or demons, or...

924
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:31,805
um, immortal alchemists,
like Dee on <i>Purgatory.</i>

925
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:36,017
I just wanted to see
if maybe we could, um, test for that.

926
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,269
Uh, yeah. Um, Sarah, I'm...

927
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:42,482
I'm an ear, nose, and throat specialist,
that's my area of expertise.

928
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:46,361
So, I don't really know a lot
about some of this other stuff.

929
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:49,072
It doesn't sound very likely to me.

930
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:52,033
And I'm not familiar with <i>Purgatory,</i>

931
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,677
uh, whatever you mentioned, the series.

932
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:57,997
Um... You know what might be a good idea,
is for you to, uh, talk to someone,

933
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,208
to talk to a psychologist and...

934
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,685
- Never mind.
- No, and tell them...

935
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,837
Okay. That's okay. Um...

936
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,922
- I'm so sorry. Thank you.
- Mmm.

937
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,174
Um, okay. Thank you. Bye.

938
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:26,609
Hey.

939
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:27,819
Hi.

940
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:29,988
You look beautiful.

941
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:31,613
So do you.

942
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:34,616
Thanks.

943
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,609
I just wanna say, um...

944
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:42,792
I am so sorry for talking about my ex
for so long the other night.

945
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:43,793
It's okay.

946
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,587
No. No, no. It's not. I mean...

947
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,430
It's, like, the lamest thing
that I could do,

948
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:51,259
and I don't wanna give you the impression
that I'm, like, hung up on my ex.

949
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,344
'Cause I'm not. I'm not, and it...

950
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:56,097
I've really enjoyed
spending time with you, and...

951
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:57,888
that's where my head's at.

952
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,309
I totally get it.

953
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:02,479
Like... after my mom died,

954
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:05,440
I, like, rewatched
every episode of <i>Purgatory,</i>

955
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:08,318
like, every season, and, um...

956
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,821
it just, like, really comforted me.

957
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:16,951
Like, I don't think it's a coincidence
that your name is Darren.

958
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,078
Yeah.

959
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,125
I'm sorry to hear about your mom.

960
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:27,253
But, uh, I'm glad that you had the show
to keep you company,

961
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,089
'cause... I know how hard that can be.

962
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,012
And, like,
I wanted to tell you that, um,

963
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,407
you don't have to worry about me
getting nosebleeds ever again,

964
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:42,268
because, um, I went to the doctor
and I got my nose fixed.

965
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,523
Uh... I thought
the nosebleed was cute, but...

966
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:47,899
Well, I'm glad you got it fixed.

967
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,542
- So, that's great.
- Yeah, it is great,

968
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:52,070
except I'll never be seeing
that doctor again, so...

969
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:53,488
Why? What happened?

970
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,156
He's just, like, a jerk.

971
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,300
He, like, make fun of you or something?

972
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,914
I was just, like, talking about him about

973
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:05,708
the paranormal and stuff, and, like,

974
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,544
he just made me feel like such an idiot

975
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,754
- for even bringing it up, and...
- What an asshole.

976
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:14,092
I mean, a doctor's whole job
is to make a patient feel good, right?

977
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,844
I mean, I think the paranormal's cool.

978
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,680
Like, ghosts and aliens and stuff.

979
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:19,973
You do?

980
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:22,376
I was reading something the other day
that was, like, uh...

981
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:24,644
It was about how the ancients
built the pyramids.

982
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,896
You know? And they built
two identical pyramids,

983
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:30,191
but on opposite sides of the world.
It's like, "How did that happen?"

984
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,568
They weren't communicating.

985
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,211
There's no phones, there's no Internet.

986
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:36,739
And, like, the actual stones
that they build the pyramids with

987
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,158
are so hard, like,
that you can't cut through those.

988
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,702
So these people were saying

989
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:43,871
that aliens were communicating
with ancient people

990
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:46,249
and they were giving them
alien technology

991
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:47,375
to build the pyramids.

992
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:50,628
Yes! It's like, it was happening
even back then,

993
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:53,089
and Satico Satellite
was giving the aliens the technology,

994
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:54,924
and the aliens were giving it
to the humans.

995
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,051
And, like, Bigfoot, Loch Ness Monster.

996
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,761
Folklore comes from somewhere,

997
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:01,889
so at some point, someone saw a Bigfoot.

998
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,975
Someone saw it. Exactly. They saw it.

999
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:06,978
And then they knew that the aliens
were using the humans as thermometers

1000
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:09,290
and bringing them back up
and downloading the information

1001
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:10,754
to learn about our planet, you know?

1002
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:13,151
- Totally.
- They could even be using human clones,

1003
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:15,778
because that would give them
more reliable information, right?

1004
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,196
Yeah. That makes sense.

1005
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,365
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

1006
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,090
Thanks.

1007
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,177
Can I show you something?

1008
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,260
Yeah.

1009
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:43,282
Keep going straight.
I'll tell you where to go.

1010
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,306
Okay.

1011
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:47,464
Is this a surprise or something?

1012
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,438
- Kind of.
- Okay.

1013
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:54,651
I don't normally like surprises, but...
I'm excited.

1014
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,527
I think you're gonna like it.

1015
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:58,946
It's just further.

1016
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:01,366
You're a lot of fun.

1017
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:03,785
You, too.

1018
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,497
Oh, okay. You're gonna take a left.

1019
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:08,915
On this street.

1020
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:29,519
Um...

1021
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:33,022
- What?
- Look!

1022
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,107
What?

1023
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,901
Right there, right there.
That guy.

1024
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,863
The guy having dinner with his wife?

1025
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:41,947
Mmm-hmm.

1026
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:45,243
I've been seeing that guy in my dreams,

1027
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:47,870
and then I started to see him
in real life.

1028
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:50,623
- What? That's crazy.
- Mmm-hmm.

1029
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,917
And, like, I didn't know my dad.

1030
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,130
And they told me that my grandpa,
like, died in Korea or something, but...

1031
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:59,340
I don't even think that's true,

1032
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:03,136
'cause, like, neither of them would have
been needed to produce me if I'm a clone.

1033
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:09,434
What... Are you kidding?

1034
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:12,145
- No. Because...
- Oh.

1035
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,980
Like, my grandma... Look...

1036
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:17,275
Okay, I think it's, like...
the clones start to, like,

1037
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:18,693
go crazy, or, like, expire,

1038
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:20,903
and then be refreshed by a newer model,
and that's me.

1039
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,990
Like, I sent my stuff to DNANU,
and they haven't responded. Nothing.

1040
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:26,873
Nothing at all. It's like they can't
process the information because...

1041
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:29,287
And, like, I've been waking up
during the abductions,

1042
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,348
so I've seen other clones,
that's how I know it's true.

1043
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:33,252
And, like, he says
he doesn't remember anything,

1044
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:34,959
but I think he's fucking lying.

1045
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:39,672
Okay.

1046
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,012
Maybe we should go.

1047
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:47,513
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1048
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:51,017
There's one more thing I wanna show you.

1049
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,121
Okay. Here. It's coming up.

1050
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:15,166
Okay.

1051
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:18,221
Okay. We're just gonna go in
right up there.

1052
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:21,380
- Okay. Why?
- I'll show you.

1053
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,384
Sarah, don't you wanna just
go home or something?

1054
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:25,885
No, no, no. Just one more thing.
It's just one more thing.

1055
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:28,261
Okay.

1056
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:33,017
Here.

1057
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,661
- Here, here, here!
- Okay. Okay.

1058
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:35,770
Darren, pull over.

1059
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:37,814
Okay. Stop. Stop.

1060
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,608
- Sarah...
- Here. Come on. Come on!

1061
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:46,531
Sarah. Sarah!
Sarah, what is happening?

1062
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,157
Come on, Darren.

1063
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:52,370
You see? It's just right here.
It's just over here!

1064
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:53,830
Why are we in the cemetery?

1065
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,957
It's this way.
It's this way. It's right here.

1066
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,251
My mom. My mom is here.

1067
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:00,229
It's my mom. We'll get her.
We're gonna dig her up,

1068
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,653
because the doctor said we can't...

1069
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:03,690
They can't just test me.
We need her DNA and my DNA.

1070
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:04,549
We're gonna get her DNA.

1071
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:06,944
When they test them together,
they can see that I'm a clone.

1072
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,888
Can you please stop
swinging the scissors around?

1073
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,221
Yeah! We'll take the scissors,

1074
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:12,866
and then we'll take it to DNANU
because it's only two states away,

1075
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,743
and we can drive there tonight!
We can drive tonight.

1076
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:17,520
We can prove that I'm the clone
they're using to get the information!

1077
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:20,064
Okay, I'm sorry, Sarah, I...

1078
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:22,900
I didn't realize that the alien stuff was,
like, so serious, okay?

1079
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:25,027
What do you mean?

1080
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:28,406
It's like Satico Satellite,
and... and the pyramids!

1081
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:30,575
What the fuck is Satico Satellite?

1082
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,078
Satico Satellite.

1083
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:36,289
They gave the technology to the aliens

1084
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:38,475
and then the aliens gave the technology
to the humans,

1085
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:41,127
and... and... You said that you knew.

1086
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,920
You said that... that you knew.

1087
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:45,590
I mean, I... I said a lot of stuff.

1088
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:48,634
Okay, talking about Loch Ness Monster,
and Bigfoot, and ghosts and shit.

1089
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,696
I thought we were talking
about conspiracy theories.

1090
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,305
I didn't know it was, like, so serious.

1091
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,222
You lied to me?

1092
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,516
What? No! No, no, no.

1093
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,840
Why... Why would you lie to me?

1094
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,353
Sarah, okay, look,
I really, really, really like you.

1095
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,277
Okay? Will you please
just get back in the car?

1096
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:04,358
Who do you work for? Who do you work for?

1097
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:05,818
I'm a paralegal.

1098
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,570
Mmm, no. What is this?

1099
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:11,032
What are you trying to do? Why are you
trying to take advantage of me?

1100
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:13,618
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

1101
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,536
Sarah, okay. What are the...
What we gonna do?

1102
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,913
Dig up your mom with scissors?

1103
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:19,457
We don't even have a shovel!
This is crazy.

1104
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:20,809
- Please, let's get back...
- No.

1105
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:22,978
- Let's please get back into the...
- No! No!

1106
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:25,421
Don't fucking touch me!
Don't fucking touch me!

1107
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:27,524
No, no, no, no, no!
Just stay the fuck away from me!

1108
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:30,235
I'm not gonna leave you in the middle
of a cemetery at night. Will you...

1109
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,094
Get the fuck away from me!

1110
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:34,722
Help! Help!

1111
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:36,432
Help!

1112
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:38,768
Get the fuck out of here!

1113
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,187
Fuck.

1114
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:46,317
Why? Why? Why? Why did he trick me?

1115
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:54,951
No, no, no!

1116
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,244
Where is it?

1117
01:05:57,995 --> 01:05:59,497
Where did...

1118
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:20,415
<i>He taught me
all I know about banishments...</i>

1119
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:25,856
<i>I could've done more.</i>

1120
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:29,276
<i>You had no way of knowing
Dee was in league with Scox.</i>

1121
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,611
<i>He had us all fooled...</i>

1122
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:35,825
No! No!

1123
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:37,588
It has to be on.
It has to be on.

1124
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:39,745
It has to be on
because of Satico Satellite.

1125
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,309
He's the god of technology,
and the aliens need to appease him.

1126
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:43,666
Okay, they come at night.

1127
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:45,769
They come at night when everything's off.
And it's not daylight.

1128
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:48,421
It's not daylight. It's electricity.
It's all about electricity.

1129
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:50,649
That's what she was talking about
on the date with Darren.

1130
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:53,175
Hey! Listen, we heard
about your date with Darren.

1131
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:55,469
Darren tricked me. Darren tricked me!

1132
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:57,614
Darren didn't trick you.
You took him to the fucking graveyard!

1133
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:59,783
- Sounds like you stalked him.
- Fuck you, Brian!

1134
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:02,727
You don't even live here!
Why are you always here?

1135
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:05,688
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, Sarah, I need you to calm down.

1136
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:07,040
Calm down. Okay? Why don't you...

1137
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:09,066
Why don't you, um,
start from the beginning

1138
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:10,293
- and explain to us...
- Listen,

1139
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:12,737
there is a secret conspiracy
at the heart of reality, okay?

1140
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,114
They're cloning me,
they cloned me from my grandma,

1141
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:16,997
they're using me
as a human thermometer, okay?

1142
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,468
Now they're trying to get rid of me.

1143
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:20,554
They're trying to get rid of me,
but this is a safe space.

1144
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:23,372
It's safe here. We're protected.
And you just have to turn that on.

1145
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:25,392
- It's off. It's not plugged in.
- Turn that on.

1146
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:27,710
- Brian, I need you to turn it on!
- It's not plugged in.

1147
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:30,629
Hey, Sarah. What you're saying
is not making any sense.

1148
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,923
Nothing makes sense. Nothing makes sense!

1149
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:35,634
No!

1150
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:38,220
This girl... She's fucking... Sarah!

1151
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,365
No, leave me alone!

1152
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:41,807
Sarah!

1153
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,517
Hey! Sarah!

1154
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:45,019
No, no, no, no.

1155
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:33,441
Joan.

1156
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:36,112
Joan!

1157
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:39,615
Joan! Joan!

1158
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:41,718
- I'll be right back. Excuse me.
- What's happening?

1159
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:42,822
- Sarah.
- What's happening?

1160
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:45,222
Shannon, get everybody out of the store.
Tell them it's closed.

1161
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:48,040
- It's an emergency. Just get them out.
- Help me! Help me! Help me!

1162
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:50,668
- What is this? What is this?
- Don't worry.

1163
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:53,546
- Okay.
- Help me. Help me.

1164
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,631
It's okay. I am helping you.

1165
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:58,968
You're just confused. Okay?

1166
01:08:59,051 --> 01:09:02,888
What is this?

1167
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:04,807
I don't what to do.

1168
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:08,894
I don't what to do. I've tried everything.
And the fabric's not working.

1169
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,313
The fabric's not working,
the lights aren't working.

1170
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:13,077
I'm just really scared.

1171
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:16,235
You know you can replace a negative
thought with a positive thought.

1172
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:19,488
- It's never gonna stop.
- You can, just try.

1173
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:21,572
Think of things you like.

1174
01:09:21,615 --> 01:09:23,701
Like marmalade. Or flowers.

1175
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:26,203
You know how you like flowers?
Think of flowers.

1176
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:29,165
No, Joan, it's bigger than that.

1177
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:31,792
It's bigger than all of that.
It's bigger than thoughts,

1178
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:32,877
it's bigger than time.

1179
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,379
It's... It's...
It's something that Helen knew.

1180
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:36,940
They got her,
and they're gonna get me.

1181
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:38,299
They're coming after me, Joan.

1182
01:09:38,382 --> 01:09:40,443
They're coming after me.
They're coming after me.

1183
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:42,678
No one's coming after you, Sarah.

1184
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:44,346
You're safe, I promise you.

1185
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,682
No one would wanna take you.

1186
01:09:46,765 --> 01:09:48,058
You're safe.

1187
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:57,651
<i>Shannon, just go. Punch out and go.</i>

1188
01:09:57,735 --> 01:10:00,654
Shannon, just go. Punch out and go.

1189
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,110
<i>Sarah, put the phone down.</i>

1190
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:08,787
Sarah, put the phone down.

1191
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,265
<i>Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

1192
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:11,749
Everything's gonna be okay.

1193
01:10:11,832 --> 01:10:13,584
<i>- I promise you.</i>
- I promise you.

1194
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:16,045
<i>- I'm your friend.</i>
- I'm your friend.

1195
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:20,549
I can hear the future.

1196
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,253
<i>I will verbally provide you
with a series of questions,</i>

1197
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:42,529
<i>please answer to the best of your ability.</i>

1198
01:10:43,447 --> 01:10:44,990
<i>When someone feels as upset as you do,</i>

1199
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:47,368
they may have thoughts
that life is not worth living.

1200
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:49,078
What thoughts have you had like this?

1201
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:51,330
None.

1202
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:55,501
Okay. If you decided
to end your life, how would you do so?

1203
01:10:57,711 --> 01:10:58,796
I don't know.

1204
01:10:59,463 --> 01:11:01,257
Have you made plans to do so?

1205
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:04,468
Okay.

1206
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:07,304
People often have mixed feelings
about harming themselves.

1207
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:10,474
What are some things that would stop you
from hurting yourself?

1208
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:14,728
My horse.

1209
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:18,691
My job.

1210
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:20,609
Occupation?

1211
01:11:21,318 --> 01:11:24,154
I'm a salesman at the craft store.

1212
01:11:25,197 --> 01:11:26,365
What store is this?

1213
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:27,991
Great Lengths.

1214
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:29,868
Great Lengths?

1215
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,745
- Great Lengths.
- Okay.

1216
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:37,501
Okay. So, this will be your room.

1217
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:39,962
And this one will be your bed.

1218
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:47,136
Try to make yourself comfortable.

1219
01:12:16,915 --> 01:12:18,208
So, before we start,

1220
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:19,918
do you want some juice
or some crackers?

1221
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:21,502
Um, juice.

1222
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,547
There you go. All right.

1223
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:26,967
All right. So, it's good to see you again.

1224
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:30,262
Um, I'm gonna be your social worker again
this week. Um...

1225
01:12:30,929 --> 01:12:33,015
No, I've never been here before.

1226
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:38,145
Oh, um... I'm sorry, I'm Ethan,
I was your social worker last time.

1227
01:12:38,228 --> 01:12:40,147
We talked a little bit about your horse

1228
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:42,441
and maybe some of the crafts
that you were doing.

1229
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:43,942
Do you remember that?

1230
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,488
I don't know.

1231
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:49,448
Okay. All right.

1232
01:12:49,948 --> 01:12:52,076
That's okay. I just wanna, um...

1233
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:55,454
How about we just talk about now
and get a sense of how you're feeling?

1234
01:12:56,246 --> 01:12:59,249
Um, are you experiencing
any anxiety or depression?

1235
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:01,960
Yeah? Anxiety?

1236
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:04,797
Uh... Scale of one to ten,
how intense?

1237
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,299
- Ten.
- And then how about depression?

1238
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:08,258
Mmm-mmm.

1239
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:10,886
- No? Well... One? Two? Three?
- One.

1240
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:12,679
One. Good. Okay.

1241
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:14,139
And are you hearing any voices,

1242
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:17,351
are you seeing anything that maybe
no one else is seeing?

1243
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:21,688
Yeah? And what is it
that you're experiencing?

1244
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,651
I'm, like, being taken.

1245
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:28,487
Like, being abducted by aliens.

1246
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:32,616
And, like, I think
that they're cloning me.

1247
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:34,576
And I've seen, like...

1248
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:38,455
Like, people always say that
I look just like my grandma,

1249
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:41,250
and, like, I've seen photos of her,
we look exactly alike.

1250
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:42,793
Like, I look like her clone.

1251
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:45,671
And... And I think... I think that I am.

1252
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:47,881
Like, I think I'm a clone of her.

1253
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,842
Okay.

1254
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:54,513
Um, can you tell me a little bit more
about your family?

1255
01:13:56,723 --> 01:13:58,851
Yeah. Um...

1256
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:04,773
You know, people always said
that my grandma was so crazy.

1257
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:06,733
Like, she was, like,

1258
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,820
talking to the walls, and, like,

1259
01:14:09,903 --> 01:14:12,656
she was hearing voices,
she thought she was from the future.

1260
01:14:12,739 --> 01:14:14,700
- Yeah.
- And she was super paranoid,

1261
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:16,368
and... and, like...

1262
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:20,330
Now I think that maybe
she wasn't crazy at all.

1263
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:22,249
Because I'm feeling it.

1264
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:24,418
Like, the same thing is happening to me.

1265
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:27,141
And she was in a place like this.
She got put in a place like this.

1266
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:29,399
And then, you know,
Reagan closed down all the hospitals,

1267
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:31,651
and she got put out on the street,
and she died as, like,

1268
01:14:31,675 --> 01:14:33,969
a homeless woman... in the streets.

1269
01:14:36,346 --> 01:14:37,431
I'm sorry.

1270
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:43,979
Um, what about your mom?
Did she have similar issues?

1271
01:14:44,062 --> 01:14:46,315
No. My mom had depression.

1272
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:51,945
My mom...

1273
01:14:59,077 --> 01:15:00,370
She...

1274
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:10,214
Mom was just, like, really depressed,
and she killed herself...

1275
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:12,007
...last year.

1276
01:15:15,802 --> 01:15:17,471
<i>I found her in her bathroom.</i>

1277
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:21,141
<i>She was just really depressed. She, um...</i>

1278
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:23,644
<i>She took a lot of pills.</i>

1279
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:36,615
I'm really sorry. Um...

1280
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:38,575
How about your dad? Is he around?

1281
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:40,577
No.

1282
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:44,039
No. I didn't have a dad. He was...

1283
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:45,916
I mean, Gary raised me.

1284
01:15:45,999 --> 01:15:47,751
I thought Gary was my dad, but...

1285
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:51,380
he left when I was, like, 16.

1286
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:53,715
And who's Gary?

1287
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:56,218
Mmm. He was my mom's husband.

1288
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:58,512
- He's her ex-husband.
- Okay.

1289
01:16:00,764 --> 01:16:03,559
You've been through a lot.

1290
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,062
I want you to know that, um...

1291
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:10,607
I... I believe that
you're telling me your truth

1292
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:14,736
and that what you're experiencing
feels 100% real to you,

1293
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,823
um, and I appreciate your honesty,
I really do.

1294
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:20,450
I can feel that from you,
and that's gonna go a long way

1295
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:22,035
in terms of, um, where we wanna go.

1296
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:26,123
But I also wanna just say,
for the sake of our rapport...

1297
01:16:26,206 --> 01:16:28,625
...uh, that I...

1298
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:32,212
I am a bit skeptical
of alien abductions and cloning,

1299
01:16:32,296 --> 01:16:34,006
- um, but I...
- Me, too.

1300
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:36,925
I know that it sounds crazy. Okay?

1301
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:40,262
I know it sounds really crazy,
but it just feels really real

1302
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:41,930
- to me, okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1303
01:16:42,472 --> 01:16:43,765
And I just...

1304
01:16:45,058 --> 01:16:47,811
I just wish that I could... start over.

1305
01:16:47,894 --> 01:16:50,606
We don't... We don't need
to go back or start over.

1306
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:53,567
We can start from right here,
and, um...

1307
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:56,486
You know, we've had great success here,
and we have an incredible team.

1308
01:16:56,570 --> 01:17:00,949
And we... I and they are
100% committed to helping you.

1309
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:21,887
Where's Ethan?

1310
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:25,766
He said he'd watch me sleep.

1311
01:17:25,849 --> 01:17:27,809
Ethan already left
for the night.

1312
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:30,520
Don't worry, Sarah, we have a full staff,
you'll be safe.

1313
01:17:32,272 --> 01:17:34,149
Try and get some rest,
it'll be good for you.

1314
01:17:35,567 --> 01:17:37,402
Okay, Sarah, have a good night.

1315
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:20,237
Where have you been? Are you okay?

1316
01:18:21,988 --> 01:18:24,741
Hello? Just talk to me,
just tell me where you went.

1317
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:27,160
- Who are you?
- What do you mean, who am I?

1318
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:31,540
- Why are you wearing Nikki's clothes?
- These are my clothes.

1319
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:33,583
Okay, just tell me how you got out.

1320
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:36,294
- What happened?
- Where are my fabrics?

1321
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:37,546
What do you mean, "fabrics"?

1322
01:18:37,629 --> 01:18:39,005
Why are you...

1323
01:18:43,927 --> 01:18:44,970
You're not Nikki.

1324
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:46,823
- What?
- No, you're wearing her clothes.

1325
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:48,658
- Why are you acting like this?
- Get away from me.

1326
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:50,410
- Get away from me.
- What do you mean, "Get away"?

1327
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:51,869
- You're not Nikki. No!
- I'm trying to help you!

1328
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:53,395
- Tell me where you went!
- No!

1329
01:18:53,478 --> 01:18:54,813
- Open up!
- No!

1330
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:57,232
Let me help you!

1331
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:01,653
Open this fucking door!

1332
01:19:03,363 --> 01:19:05,949
Open this door!

1333
01:19:06,032 --> 01:19:07,409
Open it!

1334
01:20:35,455 --> 01:20:36,455
Hey.

1335
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:40,627
What are you doing here?

1336
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:46,550
I have to keep her safe.

1337
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:07,571
Get out of here.

1338
01:21:12,617 --> 01:21:13,660
Get out of here!

1339
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:16,997
Get out of here!

1340
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:18,540
Hyah!

1341
01:21:57,162 --> 01:21:58,830
Wake up, Ron.

1342
01:22:00,123 --> 01:22:01,123
Wake up.

1343
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:47,587
I've never seen him
like that before.

1344
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:48,671
Yeah.

1345
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:51,466
- He was so angry.
- Yeah.

1346
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:53,635
It was so scary.

1347
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:57,138
You have nothing to be afraid of.

1348
01:22:58,014 --> 01:22:59,808
- Okay.
- I'm here for you.

1349
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:01,392
Yeah.

1350
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:03,603
I love you.

1351
01:28:03,486 --> 01:28:04,696
Hi.

1352
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:07,865
Hi.

1353
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:52,160
Were you just in my bed?

1354
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:58,624
Why are you in my fucking bed?

1355
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:10,053
It's you.

1356
01:29:17,393 --> 01:29:19,103
Why are you here?

1357
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:23,191
I really don't wanna
talk about that with you.

1358
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:25,443
Please.

1359
01:29:26,402 --> 01:29:28,154
Sorry. I really...

1360
01:29:28,988 --> 01:29:30,490
just wanna go back to sleep.

1361
01:29:30,573 --> 01:29:32,551
I'm just trying to figure out
what's going on.

1362
01:29:32,575 --> 01:29:34,928
I know. I... I understand.
I just don't wanna talk about it.

1363
01:29:34,952 --> 01:29:36,621
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.

1364
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:37,789
I know you.

1365
01:29:38,414 --> 01:29:40,958
I know you from somewhere
that's not... here.

1366
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:46,422
Do you remember me?

1367
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:51,552
I would like to go back to sleep.

1368
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:53,638
Please. Please, tell me. Just...

1369
01:29:54,972 --> 01:29:55,973
tell me.

1370
01:29:56,933 --> 01:30:00,061
What happened is that
I went to sleep in fucking 1995,

1371
01:30:00,144 --> 01:30:02,146
and I woke up
and all the buildings are different.

1372
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:05,233
I can't find anyone I know.
I can't find where I'm supposed to be.

1373
01:30:05,316 --> 01:30:06,150
Nothing makes sense.

1374
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:08,545
And every time I tell anybody that,
they look at me like I'm fucking crazy,

1375
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:09,880
'cause that's a crazy thing to say.

1376
01:30:09,904 --> 01:30:11,489
And now you think I'm crazy.

1377
01:30:11,572 --> 01:30:13,950
- And we're both fucking here!
- You're not crazy.

1378
01:30:14,033 --> 01:30:15,118
You're not crazy.

1379
01:30:15,201 --> 01:30:17,286
My grandmother thought
she was from the future

1380
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:18,579
and nobody believed her.

1381
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:21,624
- They can take us to other times.
- Who can?

1382
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:23,793
We're being abducted.

1383
01:30:23,876 --> 01:30:25,503
Oh, my God.

1384
01:30:25,586 --> 01:30:28,256
At the same time. No, no, no, no.
Please listen to me.

1385
01:30:28,339 --> 01:30:29,339
There's a white space.

1386
01:30:29,382 --> 01:30:32,427
There's... There's... There's a ramp
floating over the ocean.

1387
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:34,929
There's... There's...
There's the, like, fingers.

1388
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:36,472
How do you know about the ramp?

1389
01:30:37,932 --> 01:30:39,142
You've seen it.

1390
01:30:40,309 --> 01:30:41,870
Yeah, that's the dream I have
all the time.

1391
01:30:41,894 --> 01:30:43,229
How do you know about that?

1392
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:45,356
It's not a dream.

1393
01:30:50,987 --> 01:30:53,030
How do you know
about that dream?

1394
01:30:54,615 --> 01:30:56,677
How do you know about that?
I've never told you that.

1395
01:30:59,328 --> 01:31:00,705
I believe you.

1396
01:31:03,082 --> 01:31:04,917
Well, good morning.

1397
01:31:05,001 --> 01:31:07,044
- Morning.
- How are you feeling?

1398
01:31:08,004 --> 01:31:09,338
Good.

1399
01:31:09,422 --> 01:31:10,506
- Yeah.
- Good.

1400
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:13,134
I'm feeling much better
having gotten some sleep.

1401
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:16,304
And... I know I'm not a clone.

1402
01:31:16,387 --> 01:31:17,638
And I think I...

1403
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:19,974
figured a lot of stuff out.

1404
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:22,350
Um...

1405
01:31:23,269 --> 01:31:24,269
Okay.

1406
01:31:24,604 --> 01:31:26,606
Uh, sounds like
you're making good progress.

1407
01:31:27,231 --> 01:31:30,067
Um... Well, um, I have some good news.

1408
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:32,528
Um... You've been here almost 72 hours

1409
01:31:32,612 --> 01:31:35,615
and, um, Dr. Fung has decided
to discharge you today.

1410
01:31:35,698 --> 01:31:38,493
- So you're gonna be going...
- I've only been here one night.

1411
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:43,372
Um, well... It's been almost three days.

1412
01:31:43,456 --> 01:31:45,875
Um... But it's, uh...

1413
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:48,645
Look, a lot of times when people
come in for the first time,

1414
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:50,254
their brains are adjusting for a while,

1415
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:53,674
and it's not abnormal that you
wouldn't remember everything, so...

1416
01:31:56,052 --> 01:31:57,452
That actually makes a lot of sense.

1417
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:59,432
It's like how you told me yesterday
that I had...

1418
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:01,891
met you before, a few weeks ago.

1419
01:32:02,725 --> 01:32:04,769
I'm sorry, I didn't... I said...

1420
01:32:04,852 --> 01:32:07,104
It totally works.
Remember how I was telling you that

1421
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:10,149
there was a guy I was seeing
in my dream and, like, in the abductions,

1422
01:32:10,233 --> 01:32:11,567
but there was a girl there, too.

1423
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:13,051
And that girl was my roommate here,

1424
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:14,779
and she remembers the abductions, too,

1425
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:17,990
because we were both waking up,
but Ron, the guy, wasn't,

1426
01:32:18,074 --> 01:32:19,867
so he doesn't remember anything.

1427
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:22,703
And they brought her here
from another time. So, like...

1428
01:32:22,787 --> 01:32:25,915
it all makes sense, it's...
it's like a loop, it's continual.

1429
01:32:25,998 --> 01:32:28,584
It... It... It has to happen.

1430
01:32:28,668 --> 01:32:30,002
I'm not a clone.

1431
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:33,339
I am my grandmother.

1432
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:36,592
It's actually kinda beautiful.

1433
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:39,762
Okay.

1434
01:32:40,346 --> 01:32:43,307
Um... Who's the girl that you talked to?

1435
01:32:44,308 --> 01:32:46,519
Do you think I imagined the girl
in my room?

1436
01:32:46,602 --> 01:32:49,772
No. I... I actually don't know anything
about the room assignments, I just...

1437
01:32:49,855 --> 01:32:51,607
You know, I... I'm here...

1438
01:32:52,275 --> 01:32:53,651
and, uh, I just would've hoped

1439
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:56,904
that you would refrain from taking advice
from other patients.

1440
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:59,365
Well, it's not advice,
it's just the truth.

1441
01:33:01,742 --> 01:33:02,827
Okay.

1442
01:33:03,494 --> 01:33:05,454
Um... Well,

1443
01:33:06,038 --> 01:33:08,749
this will all be in your paperwork,
but I wanna highlight,

1444
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:11,043
I... I made an appointment for you, um,

1445
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:13,671
over at the Fox Haven Clinic,
it's on Green Street,

1446
01:33:13,754 --> 01:33:15,548
and, um, it's... it's free,

1447
01:33:15,631 --> 01:33:18,593
and it's your choice
whether you wanna go or not, but, um...

1448
01:33:20,011 --> 01:33:22,471
Uh, I... I really...

1449
01:33:23,055 --> 01:33:24,307
hope that you go.

1450
01:33:24,974 --> 01:33:27,310
Because I have high hopes for you.

1451
01:33:27,393 --> 01:33:29,729
And, uh, I'm... I'm rooting for you,

1452
01:33:29,812 --> 01:33:31,606
and I think it'd be very important

1453
01:33:32,231 --> 01:33:33,566
for you to follow up with that.

1454
01:33:34,233 --> 01:33:35,651
Thanks, Ethan.

1455
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:38,112
I know what I need to do.

1456
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:40,031
Well...

1457
01:33:41,490 --> 01:33:43,451
what is... what is your plan?

1458
01:34:29,246 --> 01:34:31,290
<i>I'm not gonna pay
to have them fixed,</i>

1459
01:34:31,374 --> 01:34:33,918
but I wanna be able to...
bite off asparagus.

1460
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:36,921
I can't bite asparagus 'cause it just goes
right through my teeth.

1461
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:39,423
Well, I thought you had those, uh...

1462
01:34:40,299 --> 01:34:43,469
those plates put on your teeth, those...
What do you call them? Ooh, come on.

1463
01:34:43,552 --> 01:34:45,763
- No, the... My mouthguard?
- Yeah.

1464
01:34:45,846 --> 01:34:48,526
- I don't wear that.
- That's just for snoring, or...

1465
01:34:56,774 --> 01:34:58,776
Hey, my girl.

1466
01:34:59,443 --> 01:35:00,611
Hi.

1467
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:02,780
I came back for you.

1468
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:08,369
My sweet girl.

1469
01:35:08,452 --> 01:35:09,704
Look what I brought you.

1470
01:35:19,171 --> 01:35:20,172
Hey.

1471
01:35:21,215 --> 01:35:22,550
Let's go.

1472
01:36:55,017 --> 01:36:56,017
Whoa.

1473
01:37:00,022 --> 01:37:01,857
I'll always protect you.

1474
01:37:03,776 --> 01:37:04,985
I love you.

1475
01:38:08,215 --> 01:38:13,012

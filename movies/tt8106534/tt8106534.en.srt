5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,908

6
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,247

7
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,084

8
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,627

00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,101
<i>But with loneliness...</i>

11
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,605

<i>But this isn't where the story
really starts. No, no.</i>

33
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,204
<i>That was four months ago,
on my team's first mission.</i>

34
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,749
<i>And that was a glorious clusterfuck.</i>

35
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,003
- It didn't fucking work!
<i>- One? Five for One.</i>

<i>God, I hate these numbers.</i>

- They're for your own safety.
- Get in the car.

38
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,550
She's, uh, she's bleeding.

39
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,233
- I'm aware.
- Drive!

40
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,097
Gonna smoke these motherfuckers!

41
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,310
They're shooting at us!

42
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,439
Go, go, go!

43
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,362
- We're gonna need a hospital.
- Getting a little tense in here.

44
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,375
Where did the guys come from?

45
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,604
- You said you were covering the door.
- I was covering the door.

46
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,397
- You were shot through a window!
- Such an amateur show.

47
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,756
- Oh, an amateur show?
- Yeah!

48
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,550
I know, you got shot through the window.
God, that's so bad.

49
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,861
What lawyer has this many guards?

50
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,761
You're definitely gonna die.

51
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,888
I don't know,
a lawyer with friends in high places.

52
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,851
- Mafia friends or something.
<i>- Mafia?</i>

53
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,351
The point is we got this.
That's all that matters.

54
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,436
- Yeah. What's that?
- It's... It's disturbing.

55
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,022
Gonna hurt, okay?

56
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,066
I'm gonna go in really deep
and find that bullet.

57
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,818
No, no, no. Don't.
No, you're not gonna put that in her.

58
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,529
Oh, I'm in. Feel that?

59
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,293
- Shit.
- Oh, God. There it goes.

60
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,158
Oh, that's so gross.

61
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,002
- Oh, I'm gonna yak.
- We got a tail.

62
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,871
Stop playing with your fucking gun,
and let me work.

63
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,040
Shut up. You wanna die?

64
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,209
Hey, I think they got us. You wanna...

65
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,502
Yeah, here we go. Hang on.

66
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,504
Okay.

67
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,468
It's a little tight.

68
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,721
Watch out!

69
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,233
What did you guys do in there?
Why are you covered in blood?

70
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:38,736
The head, neck, and face
are very vascular, so it's a lot of blood.

71
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,907
<i>Oh, please tell me
you didn't kill a mafia guy </i>in Italy!

72
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,909
Fuck... off.

73
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,828
No.

74
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,955
I'm trying to help you here.

75
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:54,210
And anything beyond a simple "yes"
is gonna just super suck for your face.

76
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:58,006
Look, your client is a half-wit,
fuckstain war criminal.

77
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,169
Why are you protecting him?

78
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,718
My client has never ordered
any gas attacks.

79
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,346
No, he's ordered the four generals that
work for him to order the gas attacks.

80
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,764
Just get him on the phone.

81
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,808
Let's just fucking get nuts.

82
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:09,891
What do you say?

83
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,728
Client privilege.

84
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,479
You're gonna be a pirate.

85
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,482
- This is getting blood on my car.
- Shut up!

86
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,734
There's a BMW chasing us.

87
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,328
Can I take a moment to thank you?

88
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,331
There is nothing else I'd rather be doing
with my life.

89
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,665
I don't care.

90
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,585
Go, go!

91
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,519
Whoo!

92
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,111
Oh, nuns, of course.

93
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,738
They'll forgive me.

94
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,573
What the fuck?

95
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,909
Watch out for that...

96
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,622
Ohhh...

97
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,500
Oh, I <i>so </i>had the right of way.

98
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,127
You hit one more person, and I'm walking.

99
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,505
- You hear that?
- A lot of backseat-driving going on.

100
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,016
Nice call on the Day-Glo green.

101
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,311
- Is it too flashy?
- Blends into the Italian architecture.

102
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,456
- What, you don't like this color?
- Baby, baby!

103
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,982
Baby... Baby... Baby...

104
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,494
No, no, no, no! Puppies!

105
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,540
Fuck!

106
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,213
She's fine. She's fine.

107
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,013
Uh, he's got a gun.

108
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,733
- Move!
- What?

109
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,571
- Jesus! Shoot him!
- Go get him!

110
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,449
Do it!

111
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,795
She okay?

112
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,467
- She's lost a shit ton of blood.
- This isn't a shit ton.

113
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,030
Oh, it's leaking under my seat!

114
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:52,889
I am judge of what's a shit ton.
You see? Blood. Red.

115
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,058
Can you just staunch it
or whatever the fuck you call it?

116
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,935
I can actually hear it pumping out.

117
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,606
She squirted.

118
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,959
- That was literal... She squirted.
- That's a lot of blood!

119
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,463
Tell me that didn't go in your mouth.

120
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,052
Guess this happens when you try to steal
a whole country. Right, One?

121
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,870
Yeah, we could have used
a warm-up mission.

122
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,289
Yeah, that's my problem.
I'm just getting warmed up.

123
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,968

<i>Don't be afraid now,
I'm gonna put my foot...</i>

322
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,338
<i>- Whoa!
- We'll be quiet for a second.</i>

323
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,839
<i>Do you hear any noise?</i>

324
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,049
<i>- Zero.
- Zero.</i>

325
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,056
Hey. Whoa!

326
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,640
Whoa, hey, hey!

327
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,393
<i>We got a van stepping out.
United Nations.</i>

328
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,228
<i>ISR is approaching coordinates.</i>

329
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,112
<i>Black Hawk, got eyes on the white van?</i>

330
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,650
He looks agitated, man. Something's wrong.

331
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,569
He's headed for my guys,
and I don't like it.

332
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,488
I said he is headed for my guys.

333
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,324
<i>My guys...</i>

334
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,457
Looks like the letters are backwards.

335
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:00,545
I said the UN is backwards.
Request permission to fire.

336
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,789
<i>Maybe you haven't heard,
we're spectators here.</i>

337
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,799
- <i>Commander...
- Unless you wanna</i>

338
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:08,387
<i>suck on a court-martial, I suggest
you pull up a chair and spectate.</i>

339
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,347
The van! The van!

340
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,848
RPG!

341
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,494
<i>Dear mister and missus,</i>

342
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,844
<i>you may not know me,</i>

343
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:52,931
<i>but Johnny's one of my Delta brothers;
a friend.</i>

344
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,150
Welcome home, Blaine.

345
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,406
We've been looking for a special operator
like you for a while.

346
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,994
Who are you?

347
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,414
I'm somebody who'd have let you
pull the trigger.

348
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:18,914
Excuse me?

349
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:23,962
I listened to your call.

350
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,755
Never mind how.

351
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,967
I would've let you pull that trigger.

352
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,305
Can I come in?

353
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,146
Thank you.

354
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,817
Nobody's gonna save the world.

355
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,865
But we can make it a little less shitty,
you know?

356
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,244
And I'm the guy who can help you do that.

357
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,736
You wonder what it would be like

358
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,502
if you could do the job
that you were put on this Earth to do?

359
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,127
Hmm?

360
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:10,050
You could take out some truly evil people.

361
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,345
Not people that the government tells you
are evil,

362
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:17,807
because based on, you know,
policies or politics and bureaucracy

363
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,559
or trade relations or any of that shit.

364
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:26,066
No, I'm talking truly world-class
evil motherfuckers.

365
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,737
I can help you go after those guys.

366
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:36,159
And I will never tell you
to not pull that trigger.

367
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,746
What would you say to that?

368
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,139
Hey, kid!

369
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,040
- Hey, what's that guy doing?
- Don't do it!

370
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,064
Hey!

371
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,068
Man overboard!

372
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,744
<i>Blaine was a born operator,</i>

373
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,872
a fourth-generation soldier.

374
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,252
As a matter of fact, his family fought
for us since the Second World War.

375
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:30,213
And like those before him,
Blaine believed in right and wrong,

376
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:33,341
in knowing the difference
and then doing something about it.

377
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,970
<i>He told me stories...</i>

378
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,724
he heard as a kid about his grandfather.

379
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,936
A Tuskegee airman
killed in action in 1944.

380
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,188
He would like that we're here,

381
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,066
placing these photos together...

382
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,569
...at his hero's grave.

383
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:57,073
<i>And he damn sure loved his country,</i>

384
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,534
<i>like Captain America.</i>

385
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,495
And none of us know how we would react

386
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,706
if we were put in the same position
he was.

387
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,750
<i>The fear, the noise.</i>

388
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,585
<i>But if I was Blaine,</i>

389
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,380
I would've shot the motherfuckers.
I would've blown their fucking heads off.

390
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,590
That's just me.

391
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,635
I would've been the last man standing.

392
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,639
And I don't have any military background,
but I'm like a mother duck.

393
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,307
You get in the way of my ducklings...

394
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,160
Man, just sit down.

395
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,518
Just... Just sit down.

396
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,521
You should have seen him watching <i>Coco.</i>

397
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,148
Puddle of tears.

398
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,901
It's an emotional movie.

399
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,986
He's really heaving.

400
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,613
God, that's hard to watch.Okay.

401
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,658
I think we've seen enough.

402
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,162
From now on, you will be known as Seven.

403
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:45,829
I'm One.

404
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,499
So, there's seven of us.

405
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,167
No, six.

406
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,380

410
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,351
<i>There's this trick that we all do
to get through our day.</i>

411
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:10,689
<i>We take a box and into that box,
we place all the horrors of the world,</i>

412
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,400
<i>all the wrongs humans do to one another.</i>

413
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,861
<i>And then we close the box
and pretend it doesn't exist.</i>

414
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,616
<i>Only some of us spend too much time
inside the box.</i>

415
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,369
<i>We've lost our ability to pretend.</i>

416
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,830
<i>We know there's too much
unfinished business</i>

417
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,039
<i>in this fucked-up world.</i>

418
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:33,169
<i>Our job as ghosts is to do the dirty work
the living can't or won't.</i>

419
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,423
<i>And we do it from here.</i>

420
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,092
<i>This is our haunted house.</i>

421
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,138
It's a lot like the Batcave,
except it's nothing like the Batcave.

422
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,472
Seven, you're dead.

423
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,184
<i>You're gonna be restricted to cities
that you've never visited before.</i>

424
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,436
People that you've never met.

425
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,688
All, of course, except your fellow ghosts.

426
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:55,066
None of whom you'll know by name,
only number, for safety,

427
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,652
and so no one gets too close.

428
00:28:58,737 --> 00:28:59,737
Walk over here.

429
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,615
This is our target hit board.

430
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:07,287
These nine men have been placing
too much shit inside the box.

431
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,955
So, now, they answer to us.

432
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,877
Target number one: this prick.

433
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,212
First mission:

434
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:20,467
the dictator of Turgistan, Rovach Alimov.

435
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,009
When you're dead,
you get to stop all the bullshit.

436
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:26,014
No more DMV lines,
no more shopping Christmas...

437
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,390
Or backstabbing girlfriends.

438
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,101
They should make
an "Out of Office" reply for dead people.

439
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,865
"Sorry I'm away from the planet right now.

440
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,312
I'm fucking dead."

441
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,024
No more tax, no more criminal records,

442
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:40,320
no more getting arrested by the pigs
just for being naked or just usual stuff.

443
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,697
You know, being naked, getting drunk.
Casual stuff.

444
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,878
Know the best part about being dead?

445
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,118
- Mm.
- No more immigration lines.

446
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,746
Don't look at me like that.
I'm fucking American.

447
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,039
I'm illegal.

448
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,916
You guys sure are cynical.

449
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,250
How about high blood pressure?

450
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,894
Fuck you, high blood pressure.
I'll eat whatever the fuck I want.

451
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,254
Thank you very much.

452
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,465
You realize you're actually still alive,
right?

453
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,141
Fuck you, too, technology.

454
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,620
<i>What they don't know
is I've been making magnets</i>

455
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,687
<i>since my seventh grade
science fair project,</i>

456
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,953
<i>which I completely dominated, by the way.</i>

457
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,692
<i>I figured out
how to take big stuff like this...</i>

458
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,902
This is pure shit.

459
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:21,986
<i>...into this.</i>

460
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,365
<i>I came up with neodymium, micro magnets.</i>

461
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,408
<i>Equal vibrating phones,
ten million cell phones...</i>

462
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,012
<i>...Priuses, Teslas, all use my ingenuity.</i>

463
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:33,081
And someday,
this will make me very, very rich.

464
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:38,169
You guys, you got it all wrong, you know.

465
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,505
Best thing about being dead...

466
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,423
is the freedom.

467
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,718
I mean, we're all gonna die.

468
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,138
May as well do it
while we're alive, right?

469
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,809
When you're young, you lock yourselves
into all of these bad decisions.

470
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,854
You know, marriages and mortgages,
and all that kind of stuff.

471
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:56,938
But you die...

472
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,400
it's all erased.

473
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,528
Poof! Gone.

474
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,242
From that point forward,
all that matters is what you choose.

475
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,162
The point is that we should bring Seven
behind the curtain.

476
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,164
You wanna hand me those over there?

477
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:19,377
Here we go. All right,
a little demonstration, no technology.

478
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:24,549
This is how to stage a coup
in three not-so-easy steps.

479
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,427
All right, you got a country,
Turgistan, yeah?

480
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,555
These are the people, nice people,
going about, doing their thing.

481
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:35,643
Then you got the four generals,
<i>cuatro </i>cunts, very bad guys.

482
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,228
But there's one worse guy.

483
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,606
That's the piece-of-shit dictator.

484
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,608
Right there at the top.

485
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,984
Don't forget his brother.

486
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,694
Democracy-loving brother.

487
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,487
He's the key.

488
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:50,783
So, we're gonna hit the four generals.
They're gonna lead us to the brother.

489
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:54,120
You kill top generals,
you fuck a dictator's day.

490
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,243
The second thing we're gonna do
is free the brother.

491
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:59,459
The last thing that we're gonna do
is we're gonna say goodbye

492
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:03,838
to piece-of-shit dictator
and hello to democracy-loving brother.

493
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,133
It all goes down in four months.

494
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:10,470
<i>El Día de los Muertos.</i>
The Day of the Dead.

495
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,266
Oh, that's it?

496
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,436
Oh, well, that's pretty simple, you know?

497
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,188
It's cups.

498
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,943
So, we're all gonna die?

499
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,778
Not me.

500
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,113
She's not. We all are.

501
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,241
- Painfully.
- Yeah, y'all are funny.

502
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:35,703
So, what else can you tell me
about this guy Rovach in Turgistan?

503
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,273
<i>On the Turgistan border,</i>

504
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,089
<i>hundreds of thousands
are fleeing Rovach's reign...</i>

505
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,858
<i>Military targets the aid work...</i>

506
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,843
<i>Rovach's military targets
these secret hospitals.</i>

507
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,929
<i>As the world sits on the sideline...</i>

508
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,823
A million people have been displaced
since the conflict began.

509
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:14,951
We have over 80,000 in this camp alone,
nearly half of them children.

510
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,744
- Heartbreaking. God.
- Yeah.

511
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,955
I'd love to show you
the hospital we just built.

512
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,498
We're not gonna go to the hospital.

513
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,458
I'm a little behind
on my malaria pills, but...

514
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,085
Malaria's not an issue in this part.

515
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,294
I'll be the judge of that.

516
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,547
Here's what we're gonna do, though.
Okay, I'm gonna...

517
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,174
- What's your name again?
- Oliver.

518
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,386
Oliver. Oliver here is gonna take
a picture of us right there,

519
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:36,848
and then I am going to take some shots
of some kids, hopefully not too sick,

520
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,808
nothing too depressing, no amputees.

521
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,310
Then I'm gonna carry some...

522
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,146
...you know, water jugs around,

523
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:46,482
and then I'm gonna cut your foundation
a giant check.

524
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,192
- Okay, what's your name again?
- Mike.

525
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,361
Yeah, okay. Thank you, Mike.

526
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,032
Watch out there.

527
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,867
- Please, let me help you.
- It's balanced.

528
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,784
If I dropped one,

529
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,037
I'd just walk around in circles.

530
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,080
What's that rich guy doing here?

531
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,291
I don't know.
Photo op for social media?

532
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,374
Showing he cares?

533
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,712
I should've been a soccer player.
I could've gone pro.

534
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,273
Get out of here. We're good.

535
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,403
- They're gonna hit us!
- What's going on?

536
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,824
Come with us! We gotta get the masks!

537
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,627
- Get the masks!
- Gas! Gas!

538
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,710
- Get the masks!
- Gas!

539
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,679
Gas! Gas! Gas!

540
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,163
- Go open the boxes.
- Pass them out.

541
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,232
Put that on. Put this on.

542
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,841
We're in the Louvre.
In the most beautiful place in the world.

543
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:41,926
Shut it off.

544
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,052
But, sir...

545
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,638
- Where did you find this?
- Social media, sir.

546
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:48,933
It's everywhere. News outlets
and foreign governments are greeting it

547
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,434
with universal condemnation.

548
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,958
<i>He is a war criminal
that no one holds accountable.</i>

549
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:57,024
<i>His worst atrocities involve
banned chemical weapons.</i>

550
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,441
Such a fuss.

551
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,903
It's all perfectly bloodless.

552
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,947
Who do you think shot it?

553
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,573
Impress me.

554
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:06,951
You shot it,

555
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,203
had it shot and leaked,

556
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:12,832
to communicate resolve, inspire fear.

557
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:20,840
Show my enemies what's in store for them
and for those they love.

558
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,591
It's only the beginning.

559
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,348
<i>Thou wast provoked by thy foul mind,</i>

560
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,436
which never dreamt on aught
but butcheries.

561
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,479
Say that I slew them not.

562
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,607
But dead they are,
and devilish slain by thee.

563
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,487
Why dost thou spit at me?

564
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,282
Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake.

565
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,952
Never came poison from so sweet a place.

566
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,997
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.

567
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,625
Thine eyes,
sweet lady, have infected mine.

568
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,545
Would they were
basilisks, to strike thee dead!

569
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:12,725
Martini.

570
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,561
Stirred. Not shaken, stirred.

571
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,357
What's your opinion?

572
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,986
I'll take a Negroni.

573
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,071
Just poured.

574
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,324
Sorry?

575
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,326
On the... On the play?

576
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:33,829
There's that old cliché,
"Does art actually imitate life?"

577
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,832
'Cause you got this tyrant
who's walking the stage...

578
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:37,750
Baasha.

579
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,668
And, uh, in the first act,

580
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,339
his cruelty goes completely unpunished.

581
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,548
But in the fifth...

582
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,470
In the fifth... justice.

583
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,640
Always justice.

584
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,017
You see a tyrant.

585
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:58,479
I see a man bringing order
to a disordered world.

586
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:02,650
Scouring its filth,
polishing it till it shines.

587
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,945
In art, our most fervent hopes come true.

588
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,655
Heroes always win.

589
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,739
It's bullshit.

590
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:13,869
In life... totally different.

591
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:19,750
Nah, I'm with Shakespeare.
Act Five's coming.

592
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,544
- To Shakespeare.
- Mm.

593
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:22,627
To Bill.

594
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,297
I think you both just spoiled the end.

595
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,341
No.

596
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:30,928
We didn't.

597
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,436
I didn't catch your name.

598
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,604
- Rovach.
- No, I was talking to her.

599
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,860
Do you mind? I can feel the tip.

600
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,196
Yeah.

601
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,200
He's no longer inside me. We're safe.

602
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,493
What is your name?

603
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,288
Arianna.

604
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:00,332
Arianna.
Big guy's still staring at me, isn't he?

605
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,961
- Yeah.
- He's gonna kick my ass later.

606
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,044
- Good.
- Yeah.

'Cause the chocolates have lasted

And what about you?

622
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,143
I just feel like the whole world's,
like, on an...

623
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,812
endless, evil...

624
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,940
shitty loop.

625
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,608
Hmm.

626
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,361
But he'll get his.

627
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,702
You know, this was fun.

628
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,373
Are you ghosting me?

629
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,324
Do I look like a ghost to you?

630
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,587
No. It's like the things you say,
it sounds like you want to be.

631
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,089
- The things I say.
- Mm-hmm.

632
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,426
But what makes you think
that I want to see you again?

633
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,099
You weren't that memorable.

634
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,059
Ow!

635
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,479
Besides, I'm moving to New York.

636
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,731
Mmm.

637
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,233
That's where I live.

638
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,359
Sucker.

639
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,028
So, now you're stalking me?

640
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,405
Maybe a little bit.

641
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:10,337
<i>And now you're all caught up.</i>

642
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:18,143
<i>Anything happen in school today?</i>

643
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,806
<i>Angela Valentine said
she was going to get sick in class.</i>

644
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,016
<i>What happened?</i>

645
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,099
<i>She did.</i>

646
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:26,478
- Hey, what do you know about One?
- He loves Wally the dog.

647
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:29,648
He's obsessed with this <i>Beaver </i>show.
I think he's an orphan.

648
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,192
We got a little bet on
if you wanna put some money in.

649
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,290
It's an interesting crew
you got here, bro.

650
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,696
How many missions you guys run?

651
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:36,859
- Counting Florence?
- Yeah.

652
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,033
- One.
- One what?

653
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,219
Actually, no, there was, um,
this, like, mini-mission,

654
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,162
so maybe one and a quarter.
It was in Sicily.

655
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,414
But Florence, absolute shitshow.

656
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:48,334
I mean, if I wasn't there,
probably more than one of us dead.

657
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,537
- That's all I'm saying.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

658
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,338
I don't fuck around.

659
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:55,061
You realize I just buried myself
in front of my family and friends?

660
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,550
Yeah, One told me about that.

661
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,302
Big military funeral.

662
00:43:58,385 --> 00:43:59,595
Guns popping, flags.

663
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,616
It's pretty cool. At my funeral,
there was five people there,

664
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,224
and two of them left before the end.

665
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,352
It is tough watching
your mum cry at your grave.

666
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,269
Yeah.

667
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,812
This mission, I got a good feeling.

668
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,106
I got a really good feeling
about this mission.

669
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,361
How come you can't find this guy?

670
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:18,656
I don't know. One can usually find anyone,
but he just can't seem to find him.

671
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,824
He said Americans caught him
a few years back.

672
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,076
Americans?

673
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:23,494
I don't know.

I was assured by your state department...

686
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:22,720
- I'm from a different department.
- God, CIA.

687
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,471
I've come to deliver you to your brother.

688
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:28,267
You don't know my brother.
Rovach is a monster.

00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:33,021
He'll violate every single principle

I begged the director
not to do this, Murat, begged.

691
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,753
The Americans caught him years back
and gave him to his brother.

692
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,697
That bald-looking fella.
You like him though, One, yeah?

693
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,074
He's definitely an arsehole,
but a likable arseshole, no?

694
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,410
- No.
- Well, he likes you.

695
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:49,496
Here's the fun part.

696
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,623
<i>How many billionaires

00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,754
<i>Okay. Of course
you haven't heard of me before.</i>

699
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,465

702
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,681
<i>where I met some interesting people,
did some adventurous shit.</i>

703
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,811
<i>But slowly, I cleaned house,

704
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,897
<i>Used my money to help people

705
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,608
<i>But I realized,
my billions, that's not enough.</i>

706
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,693
<i>Governments don't really help
people in need.</i>

707
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:23,447
<i>So, I said, "Fuck the government.
I'm gonna do this myself."</i>

708
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,450

00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,775
- Come here.
- Nose off.

793
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,734
Way better.

794
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:18,950
<i>♪ Can we talk about us ♪</i>

795
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:22,370
<i>♪ Like we care about us? ♪</i>

796
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:25,707
<i>♪ Can we talk about us... ♪</i>

797
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,627
Where are you running to?

798
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,630
One promised my soul back.

799
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:34,299
I just gotta talk to somebody.

800
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,717
You're scared.

801
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,636
You're such a pussy.

802
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,554
Ever stage a <i>coup d'état?</i>

803
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,390
No. No, I don't even know what it means.

804
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:47,270
Oh, wow. A coup. A <i>coup d’état.</i>
It's French, Napoleon.

805
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,814
French history stuff.

806
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:50,482
Okay.

807
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:52,521
You can't tear a place down

808
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,319
until you have someone
to build it back up.

809
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:57,155
That someone is Rovach's brother, Murat.

810
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,782
Imprisoned in Hong Kong.

811
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:01,368
You see, the army's fucked
now we killed the generals.

812
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,745
They will look for a new leader.

813
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,205
And we're gonna give them one.

814
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:09,251
"Coup." I don't even know what it means.
Stupid word.

815
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,813
Oh, my favorite.

816
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:32,107
I know, Mama. How you doing?

817
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,900
Well, you see, Ma...

818
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:41,783
there's this country, Uzbekis...
No, Turg...

819
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,661
Turkis... Turkikas...

820
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,746
Fuck! Turkikasazhan?

821
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,541
Ma, all I know is that it's got a "stan"
at the end,

822
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:52,335
- and it's in Asia.
- Oh, by Kansas!

823
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,881
Ish. Yes, Mama, by Kansas.

824
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:59,009
Anyway, the man who ran it died,
and, uh...

825
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,722
he... he left behind two sons.

826
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:04,931
One good and one bad.

827
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,893
And the bad one came out on top.

828
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:10,016
So, what the fuck are you looking at,
Nurse Ratched?

829
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,395
Huh?

830
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,648
Go hang with the fucking nuns
or something.

831
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:15,567
Yeah, walk.

832
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,650
Walk.

833
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:19,571
I will fucking knock you out
in front of my mother.

834
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:23,782
Sorry, Mama.

835
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:27,954
Anyway, the two sons fought,
and the bad one came out on top,

836
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,498
so he locked the good one up, and...

837
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,250
I never liked Diego.

838
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:36,254
Yeah, me either, Mama.
Working for him didn't agree with me.

839
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,634
But I work for someone else now, Ma.
We're doing good things.

840
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:43,929
Huh? We're fixing
what's going on in Kansas.

841
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,266
Good things can erase the bad ones,
right, Mama?

842
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,938
I love you, Andres.

843
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,648
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

844
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,651
No, Ma, Andres is in Bogota.
It's me, Javi.

845
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,445
- Javi.
- Javi?

846
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:03,907
I won't speak to Javi anymore
because he is a murderer.

847
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:07,535
Ma, it was only bad people, Mama.

848
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,385
Please,
you don't have to do this.

849
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,590
No, I do. My job.

850
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:29,516
Daddy?

851
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,184
I can't sleep.

852
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:43,779
Daddy?

853
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,450
He's not here.

854
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,244
Where's your mommy?

855
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,746
I don't have a mommy.

856
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,215
Javi loves you, Mama. Huh?

857
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:10,682
You and your Bruce Wayne shit!

858
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:11,891
Boo.

859
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,475
One rule.

860
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:15,770
One rule.

861
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,191
You don't know what it's like
to have someone.

862
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,152
She doesn't even remember my name.

863
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,945
So, she'll never know you stopped coming.

864
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:27,324
See, you're lucky that I don't paint
the inside of this car

865
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:28,783
with chunks of your fucking skull.

866
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,452
Jesus, who raised you, the mob?

867
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:32,704
That's none of your fucking business,
Three.

868
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:35,999
We sacrificed everything
to be a part of this.

869
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:38,251
Honor it, respect it. It's all we got.

870
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:48,636
I don't usually stand on ceremony,
but today,

871
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:51,765
what just befell your superiors
in America

872
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:55,935
undid over 60 years of loyal service
to my family.

873
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:58,813
Those fine men won't be replaced easily.

874
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:04,110
Colonel Zaga, Niazo, Abdulim, Daheem.

875
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,113
You're next in line, gentlemen.

876
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:13,244
Your combined experience is nearly that
of your predecessors,

877
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:16,289
but if my generals' shoes
are to be filled,

878
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,709
I need men like you.

879
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,003
Like you,

880
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,339
but not you.

881
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,236
I don't know
who killed my generals,

882
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:49,781
but I'd be a fool to trust the men
who most stood to benefit.

883
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:53,993
So, next men up, congratulations!

884
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:06,172
All right, we're gonna tiptoe
through these waypoints here, under radar.

885
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,841
There's our backdoor to Hong Kong.

886
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:09,466
Hey, One!

887
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,678
You ever plan on calling me Six?

888
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,180
- No.
- Okay.

889
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:17,535
- Hey, look, I know we don't get to ask...
- Then don't.

890
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,352
But, uh, who is One?

891
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,563
- Who is he?
- A rich guy who snapped.

892
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:22,480
That's all I got.

893
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,691
- Yeah, but how did you meet him?
- We didn't.

894
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:27,485
He met us. In really weird ways.

895
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:28,987
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. Very weird,

896
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:31,781
like, perfect timing kind of weird.

897
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,251
Cheap. Fake.

898
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:46,754
Fuck! We ain't leaving
till we find the Kalahari.

899
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:01,060
Let's go.

900
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,214
Oh, shit.

901
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:35,636
Shit!

902
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,021
Whoa, whoa!

903
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,983
Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

904
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:50,651
Hang on!

905
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:14,300
I'm rich.

906
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,861
What do you want?
What do you fucking want?

907
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,947
Hey! Hey! Calm down.

908
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:38,908
What are you? Are you a fucking pig?

909
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,288
Are you afraid?

910
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,082
Never.

911
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:51,921
There's power in that.

912
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,134
More power finding a cause.

913
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:00,966
Something so important
that you're afraid to lose it,

914
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:03,266
afraid that you're gonna die
some other way.

915
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:04,517
For nothing...

916
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,496
- instead of what you're fighting for.
- You're making a mistake to do this.

917
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,688
I'm a thief.

918
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,982
I've been robbing my whole f...
I can make you money.

919
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:12,734
- Are you afraid?
- I've got skills.

920
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,987
- I can be useful. I can help you.
- You're gonna die now.

921
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,923
- I can fucking help you!
- Gonna fucking die now.

922
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:20,366
- If you're gonna do it, fucking do it.
- You die now!

923
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,451
Fucking do it!

924
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,836
- Oh, my God!
- You sick fuck! Who fucking does that?

925
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:34,756
- You should have seen your face.
- You sick fuck!

926
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:36,174
It's not fucking funny!

927
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:37,717
It's really funny.

928
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,304
Ooh, I never thought I'd meet a family
more screwed up than mine.

929
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:44,307
Hey, no. Don't say that.
He hates the word "family." I don't know.

930
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:45,516
I think he never had one.

931
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,644
And if you're ever left behind
in a mission...

932
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,646
he's not coming back for you.

933
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:50,729
What?

934
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:52,940
We Deltas don't operate like that.

935
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,985
Things are gonna have to change.
I promise you that.

936
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:59,530
<i>FMS, Hong Kong. Engine start.</i>

937
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:03,284
Look, I know we're not supposed to ask,
but I'm a nosy dude.

938
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:04,827
So, here goes.

939
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,663
You could have fought a million battles.

940
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,666
Why now... and why Turgistan?

941
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:13,294
Everybody talks about helping.
It's nice to actually do something.

942
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,566
It is quite the view, little brother.

943
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:40,863
Personally, I'd prefer more gold,
you know.

944
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:43,950
Black.

945
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:47,161
- I'm alone.
- Closing on you, it's, like, dark.

946
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,082
You know Sultan Ahmed I?

947
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:52,625
That shit.

948
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:57,213
In 1603, Sultan Ahmed I
gave a gift to his younger siblings.

949
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:59,298
Magnificent wing in Topkapi Palace.

950
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,550
The gilded cage.

951
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:03,386
Yeah, I've learned my history, too.

952
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:07,306
Would you prefer the sultans before Ahmed?

953
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:11,227
Who strangled the younger brother
with the same silk sheets?

954
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:18,067
You have your own library, screening room.

955
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:20,445
Yeah, it's a fun prison.

956
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:23,448
And this, what is... what is this?

957
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:24,741
Art.

958
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:25,867
Ugly art.

959
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,412
And the occasional visit
from a loving brother.

960
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:32,582
Quite generous after you tried to take
what was rightfully mine.

961
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,917
The throne is not yours or mine.

962
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:37,503
- It belongs to the people.
- The people?

963
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,005
Yes, brother, the people.

964
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:40,798
Like they're some sacred body.

965
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:46,220
Instead of a violent, ignorant,
illiterate mob who just begs for the whip.

966
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,556
He's got his anger issues.

967
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,518
What are you doing here?

968
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:56,063
These shameful chemical attacks of yours,

969
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:58,566
you're making me more popular
than yourself.

970
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:01,360
The only way you'll ever leave this place

971
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:04,489
is if Daqeeq here throws you
through that window.

972
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:06,032
I wish.

973
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:16,125
My generals, the Four Horsemen,
were just executed.

974
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,128
Do you know anything about that?

975
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:21,756
Do you?

976
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:27,220
These attacks on my generals

977
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,223
will only increase the frequency
of my chemical strikes.

978
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:35,061
It may take years,
but they will carve you up

979
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:38,356
for all the beautiful things
you have done for these people.

980
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:41,025
Who? The US? They made me.

981
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,986
Russia? They armed me.

982
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:48,825
Daqeeq, seriously?

983
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,535
Did you buy that shirt by yourself?

984
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:52,410
You're embarrassing me.

985
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,705
Sorry. I have bad taste.

986
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:59,085
Daqeeq is under strict order:

987
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:02,964
If any harm should befall me,
the same exact harm will befall you.

988
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,841
Specifically and immediately.

989
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,301
I'm going back to Turgistan.

990
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,595
To my safe travels.

991
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:14,976
<i>Hey, team, we're below radar.</i>

992
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:17,687
<i>So, buckle up
'cause it's about to get bumpy.</i>

993
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:19,689
Oh, fuck me.

994
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:23,568
You know, I usually look at the stewardess
to see if I should be scared.

995
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:25,736
Flight attendant.

996
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:27,989
You can look at me.

997
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,242
Oh, darling, you could be on fire,

998
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:33,925
and you would have the same creepy,
blank expression on your face.

999
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:34,954
No offense.

1000
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:37,582
You know, guys, what sucks?

1001
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:41,586
If we were to crash,
no one would ever know or care.

1002
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:43,421
We would have no impact on anything.

1003
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:44,797
Like we never existed.

1004
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,651
<i>I can hear you,
and if you're gonna shit your pants,</i>

1005
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:49,176
<i>there's a bathroom in the back.</i>

1006
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:55,266
<i>The world is wrapped in red tape,</i>

1007
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:59,312
<i>and I couldn't cut through it
even with a billion-dollar sword.</i>

1008
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,231
<i>So, we left behind everything,</i>

1009
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,525
<i>everyone,</i>

1010
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:05,776
<i>to become...</i>

1011
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:07,527
<i>no one.</i>

1012
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:13,993
So, how long's this been going on?

1013
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,245
What?

1014
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:19,081
I've been wondering the same thing.
Florence?

1015
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,167
Nah, Vegas.

1016
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,127
- Vegas.
- Definitely Vegas.

1017
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,421
So, you guys know about us?

1018
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,883
- Well, we do now, dumbass.
- Nice.

1019
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:31,594
Well, I guess it's not against the rules,
right?

1020
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:35,264
Depends.
So, are you guys fucking or making love?

1021
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:36,515
What's the difference?

1022
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:38,266
We're fucking.

1023
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:40,645
Oh, good.

1024
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:43,230
Hey. Who's this honey badger?

1025
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,566
- I'm... I'm Raymond.
- Hi, Raymond.

1026
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:46,901
You new to the team?

1027
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:48,486
Just... Just hanging out.

1028
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:50,153
It's Britney, bitch.

1029
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:53,240
So, we should probably go discuss
our sensitive geopolitical issues

1030
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:56,035
when we're, you know, Raymond-free.
Great security, though.

1031
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,286
Really great.

1032
01:05:57,745 --> 01:05:58,829
Especially you.

1033
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:02,959
Hong Kong, penthouse extraction.

1034
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:06,754
<i>We're gonna break out Rovach's
baby brother from his 90th-floor prison.</i>

1035
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:10,466
It's a simple snatch-and-grab.
Minus the word simple because it's not.

1036
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:12,176
- And minus the word snatch...
- Snatch?

1037
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:13,636
- Snatch.
- Snatch.

1038
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:15,322
- Snatch what?
- Minus the word "snatch-and-grab."

1039
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:16,949
- They mean the same thing.
- Snatch?

1040
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,391
Snatch. Stop saying that.

1041
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:20,935
This mine.

1042
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:23,312
<i>Yeah, nothing's simple.</i>

1043
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:25,856
<i>The next building over,
we use the sky cranes.</i>

1044
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,692
One as a sniper's nest for yours truly,

1045
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:29,375
<i>one as a crossover,
building to building.</i>

1046
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:32,071
<i>Crane lose control. Very dangerous.</i>

1047
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,575
- Stay off the roof.
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

1048
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,657
- Because I will fuck you up.
- You not fuck me up.

1049
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,869
Motherfucker.

1050
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:40,097
- What?
<i>- Don't talk to me like this!</i>

1051
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:42,081
- Smash you like a bitch.
- No, no, no, no.

1052
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:43,499
No? Bye.

1053
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:54,343
<i>We have 15 minutes
before HK police arrive.</i>

1054
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:08,524
- You afraid?
- Nope.

1055
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:10,985
- Good luck.
- Saying good luck is bad luck.

1056
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:13,404
- I take it back.
- Taking it back is even worse luck.

1057
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:15,281
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Yeah.

1058
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:17,115
Good luck.

1059
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:18,993
Do you want me to die?

1060
01:07:19,493 --> 01:07:20,493
Wanker.

1061
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:24,706
It's time.

1062
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:35,301
<i>Ferrari's landed.</i>

1063
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:41,297
<i>It's a good ride, One.</i>

1064
01:07:41,348 --> 01:07:43,225
<i>A little scary up here, but...</i>

1065
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:46,228
<i>Nah, this is fun.
Don't be a pussy, Seven.</i>

1066
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:48,731
Yeah, I got the gun, smartass.

1067
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:49,815
Remember that.

1068
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:54,195
<i>Slow it down, One. Slow it down.</i>

1069
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:59,158
<i>Overwatch is set.</i>

1070
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:04,747
I got the target in his bed,
scratching his balls,

1071
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:06,290
reading some Chinese book.

1072
01:08:06,373 --> 01:08:07,458
Hit it, guys.

1073
01:08:17,384 --> 01:08:18,719
<i>Eagle's landed.</i>

1074
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:20,429
<i>I love that movie line.</i>

1075
01:08:34,693 --> 01:08:35,861
Hello, boys.

1076
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:43,702
You know, laughter is life.

1077
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:46,872
Just kidding.
I stole that from my old dentist's office.

1078
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,332
Along with a shit ton of nitrous.

1079
01:08:51,752 --> 01:08:52,753
Hey!

1080
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,423
Badges? We don't need no stinking badges.

1081
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,177
One, laughing gas is working.

1082
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,933
Oh, shit.

1083
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:09,937
We got a 911.

1084
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:12,314
<i>- Cops were called.</i>
- Cops?

1085
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:13,649
<i>We got 13 minutes.</i>

1086
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:19,530
Zip line secure.

1087
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:22,740
Ready, ready.

1088
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:24,534
<i>One.</i>

1089
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:27,580
There's movement, man.

1090
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:28,747
Where?

1091
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:31,000
<i>Four bogeys. Rooftop.</i>

1092
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:42,845
What, am I funny to you?

1093
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:43,804
Huh?

1094
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:44,930
I'm funny?

1095
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,724
How am I funny to you?

1096
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:48,350
Do I amuse you?

1097
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:52,521
I'm gonna need your finger. Come here.

1098
01:09:59,236 --> 01:10:00,988
<i>Two and Three, in the elevator.</i>

1099
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:04,033
<i>All right. You got targets.</i>

1100
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:05,284
On your left, eye level.

1101
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:20,633
<i>Underwater. Thirty seconds.</i>

1102
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,804
He's in some shit, man.

1103
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:32,269
<i>Freeze, Four.</i>

1104
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:33,854
<i>He's above you.</i>

1105
01:10:35,272 --> 01:10:36,482
<i>Sixty seconds.</i>

1106
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:39,318
One, he's gonna drown. I got four guys
up top. Want me to drop 'em?

1107
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:40,694
No, mission will be compromised.

1108
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,864
<i>Let me drop 'em, One. This is what I do.</i>

1109
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:48,244
<i>He's been under 120.</i>

1110
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,079
<i>He's gonna drown.</i>

1111
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:52,997
Four, move right.

1112
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:56,669
<i>Incoming round.</i>

1113
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:01,465
<i>You're welcome.</i>

1114
01:11:01,548 --> 01:11:04,093
<i>And y'all can refer to me as Mr. Seven
from now on.</i>

1115
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,013
Hot mask.

1116
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,808
In a Darth Vader daughter kind of way.

1117
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:13,477
Maybe later we can... coochie-coochie?

1118
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,395
Stop it.

1119
01:11:14,478 --> 01:11:15,854
<i>Woochie-woochie-coochie.</i>

1120
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,314
A little over-the-top, guys.

1121
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:18,607
Oh, Check this out.

1122
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,067
I went to the dentist.

1123
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:21,735
Oh, my God.

1124
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:24,196
- You lost one of the seals!
- Huh?

1125
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,448
You're on laughing gas,
you dumb motherfucker.

1126
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:27,676
Give me your gun.

1127
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,262
- I'm not giving you my gun.
- You're a danger to yourself.

1128
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,413
I <i>am </i>the danger.

1129
01:11:32,496 --> 01:11:33,536
<i>No more movie lines.</i>

1130
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,582
Okay? Not just tonight... but ever.

1131
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:37,710
It's a TV line, not a movie line.

1132
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:39,003
Just stay behind me.

1133
01:11:39,086 --> 01:11:40,838
Yes, Miss Vader.

1134
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:46,152
- You almost done there?
<i>- Okay, we've got a problem.</i>

1135
01:11:46,176 --> 01:11:49,138
Three got hit with nitrous,
and he's stupider than usual.

1136
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:51,849
This is the funniest shit ever!

1137
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:57,062
<i>How you doing over there?</i>

1138
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,188
<i>You having fun yet?</i>

1139
01:11:58,272 --> 01:12:00,752
Anyone ever asked you dumb questions
when you're 90 stories up?

1140
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:02,484
No need to climb angry.

1141
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:05,070
Mate, you're really ruining my flow
right now, you know that?

1142
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:06,840
<i>Get those
high-intensity speakers placed.</i>

1143
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:08,866
I got the targets all grouped
in the kitchen.

1144
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:12,161
Hey, have you ever... you ever been
to an American movie theater?

1145
01:12:12,244 --> 01:12:14,246
<i>Between 1983 and 2015?</i>

1146
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,206
No, I just pirate them on my phone.

1147
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:18,584
That's an asshole move. All right.

1148
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:20,711
Get ready to pull that trigger.

1149
01:12:20,794 --> 01:12:22,046
Till my finger hurts.

1150
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:35,976
Shut that music down!

1151
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,603
No party here! No party!

1152
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:47,988
Hit it.

1153
01:12:48,072 --> 01:12:49,072
<i>Now.</i>

1154
01:12:55,662 --> 01:12:57,247
I see dead people.

1155
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:09,944
Help me.

1156
01:13:09,968 --> 01:13:10,968
Three!

1157
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:12,763
Get off.

1158
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:15,178
What are you doing?

1159
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:18,936
Move, move, move.
Move, move, move, move, move.

1160
01:13:25,275 --> 01:13:27,528
I got 'em up top.

1161
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:31,949
<i>Move.</i>

1162
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:37,579
Who are you? Stay away. Stay away!

1163
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:40,250
- Let's go.
<i>- One, Four's got the target.</i>

1164
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:41,959
<i>Always starts out well.</i>

1165
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:44,162
- Stay low.
- You're American military?

1166
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:47,714
<i>Two, Three, you're clear to move up top.</i>

1167
01:13:48,465 --> 01:13:49,967
Four, move.

1168
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,427
Got the target. Moving out.

1169
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:53,137
Let's go.

1170
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,847
Oh, wow. Look at this.

1171
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:57,015
- Stay behind me, idiot.
- Oh, yeah.

1172
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:02,830
- Don't move!
<i>- I got him.</i>

1173
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,273
Come on.

1174
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:07,067
Move, move, move, move, move.

1175
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:13,323
Get back here!

1176
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:14,450
One sec.

1177
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:16,994
- Oh, pearl handle.
- Oh, shit.

1178
01:14:17,077 --> 01:14:18,454
That's a cool piece.

1179
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:20,664
This is like bringing a child
to a gunfight.

1180
01:14:22,749 --> 01:14:23,749
Whoa.

1181
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:28,755
There you go. Come on, come on, come on.
Say peek-a-boo, you punk.

1182
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:30,798
No, no! Stop!

1183
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:34,261
<i>Ouch!</i>

1184
01:14:34,344 --> 01:14:35,971
<i>Who the fuck was that?</i>

1185
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:37,639
<i>Somebody speak to me.</i>

1186
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:41,268
<i>- Please tell me I did not just kill Three.</i>
- What? These are good masks.

1187
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:43,687
The hell you picking up
a bad guy's gun for, man?

1188
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:45,707
- <i>You shot me, bro!
- </i>This is going great.

1189
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,584
- You shot me!
<i>- Because you're an idiot.</i>

1190
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:50,777
<i>- You don't look through a bullet hole.</i>
- I'm so mad at everyone right now.

1191
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:52,488
What's new? I like you mad.

1192
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:54,740
Wrong intel. Too many men.

1193
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,909
Oh, no. I'm pissed now.

1194
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:59,578
I just got shot by my own man.
More guys coming.

1195
01:15:08,795 --> 01:15:10,523
<i>What's going on?
You guys have one minute left.</i>

1196
01:15:10,547 --> 01:15:12,966
We're only supposed to have
seven guys working.

1197
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:14,551
Where are they coming from?

1198
01:15:14,968 --> 01:15:15,968
Go.

1199
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:17,638
<i>We got five more targets.</i>

1200
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:28,469
Get up here now, all you've got.

1201
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:36,156
Watch out for the snipers.

1202
01:15:37,282 --> 01:15:39,493
Two at the bar, three in the corner.

1203
01:15:39,576 --> 01:15:42,579
Okay, we do like that movie
<i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,</i> okay?

1204
01:15:43,413 --> 01:15:45,207
They died at the end of that movie.

1205
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:48,126
- They do?
<i>- </i>Yeah.

1206
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:03,267
Hey, Chan, what's up?

1207
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:12,359
<i>Two, Three, hold at the stair.</i>

1208
01:16:27,207 --> 01:16:29,001
Fifteen minutes.

1209
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:32,671
<i>Half of China's in the lobby.</i>

1210
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:34,381
That's... That's high.

1211
01:16:34,464 --> 01:16:37,217
<i>We're out of time.
What the hell are you guys doing up there?</i>

1212
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:38,844
Come on.

1213
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:42,806
We're stuck at the stairwell.

1214
01:16:43,473 --> 01:16:44,850
<i>Can we go down?</i>

1215
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:47,603
Negative. This place is full of police.
Do not come down.

1216
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:52,649
They're surrounding us.

1217
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:54,526
Only one way out. That's up.

1218
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:57,362
Two coming up.

1219
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:01,283
Guys, I got a bad idea.

1220
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:04,453
What do you mean you have a bad idea?
No, you're supposed to have good ideas.

1221
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:10,208
Like a... really, really bad idea.

1222
01:17:12,836 --> 01:17:15,172
<i>One, remember when I said
some shit was gonna go bad?</i>

1223
01:17:15,255 --> 01:17:17,215
Shoot people! You're a sniper, goddamn it!

1224
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:20,052
<i>It's fucked up right now,
so watch me work. I'm improvising.</i>

1225
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:22,262
Y'all might wanna grab a hold
of some shit.

1226
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:25,140
- What do you mean?
- The pool!

1227
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:26,683
Oh, no, no, no! Back, back!

1228
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,518
Grab something!

1229
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:36,193
Jump!

1230
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:05,430
Hang on!

1231
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,918
You drowned everybody!

1232
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:38,171
Drowned the whole fucking team!

1233
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:39,774
- Dumbest idea ever.
- Fucking crazy.

1234
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:41,526
- Almost killed us.
- I don't like Seven.

1235
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:44,153
- <i>We need a long talk after this.
- We'll chat later.</i>

1236
01:18:44,177 --> 01:18:46,555
Hey. Whoa, whoa.Okay.

1237
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:48,055
Whoa.

1238
01:18:57,649 --> 01:19:00,009
<i>You wanna tell everyone
where you learned that shit?</i>

1239
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:07,325
- Go.
- Is a helicopter coming to rescue us?

1240
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:08,729
- Pretty soon.
- 'Cause...

1241
01:19:08,785 --> 01:19:11,329
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Come on, no. What? Wait.

1242
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:14,624
Oh, my God. I'm afraid of heights.
I will have a heart attack.

1243
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:16,835
- Yeah? Don't cover your face!
- Ah!

1244
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:18,628
- Ow!
- Why?

1245
01:19:20,213 --> 01:19:21,691
- I'm knocking him out.
- Stop.

1246
01:19:21,715 --> 01:19:23,467
- You're to save...
- Come on!

1247
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:25,051
It's gonna be over soon!

1248
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:26,678
- Ow!
- Hey, hey, hey!

1249
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,180
- Go down!
- Stop!

1250
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:30,140
- Goddamn it!
- What bullshit is this?

1251
01:19:30,223 --> 01:19:31,863
I thought you guys are here to rescue me.

1252
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:33,560
- He's the <i>good guy.</i>
- Yes!

1253
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:35,979
What's wrong with you, you fucking goon?

1254
01:19:36,062 --> 01:19:38,666
- I was trying to knock him out.
- No. He's the point of the mission.

1255
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:40,050
- Use your head.
- He wasn't going.

1256
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:40,942
No, get out! Go!

1257
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:44,821
Oh, my God!

1258
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:46,281
- Go.
- Whatever. I'm leaving.

1259
01:19:46,364 --> 01:19:47,532
<i>Adiós,</i> asshole.

1260
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:02,964
No. No!

1261
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:05,675
- No! No, no. Stay away.
- Come here!

1262
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:10,472
Get off me.

1263
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:13,642
- You fucking...
- Hey!

1264
01:20:15,435 --> 01:20:16,269
Come on.

1265
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:17,521
Oh, now what?

1266
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:19,898
- Do you have rabies?
- No.

1267
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:21,107
You have rabies?

1268
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:22,234
- What?
- What?

1269
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:24,945
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- He was escaping.

1270
01:20:25,028 --> 01:20:27,447
And why do you think
he might wanna get away from you?

1271
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:29,331
You should thank me.
I just saved the mission.

1272
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:31,034
What? Get off of him.

1273
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:33,055
- Get off of him.
- Get off me.

1274
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:35,288
How many times
do I have to save this mission? Fuck.

1275
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:38,500
- Probably have some ice in the car.
- Fucking sick prick. I'm so sorry.

1276
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:40,223
- Your buddy is an asshole.
- Hey.

1277
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:41,545
Come on. It gets better.

1278
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:42,628
Don't help.

1279
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:45,507
Don't help. Just stay right there,
James Bond. Thank you.

1280
01:20:47,008 --> 01:20:48,051
Oh, shit.

1281
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:52,137
Three bullets.

1282
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,686
Come on, Four. We're moving.

1283
01:20:58,562 --> 01:20:59,562
Just go.

1284
01:21:00,605 --> 01:21:01,605
<i>I can't get across.</i>

1285
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:03,984
<i>They cut the zip line.</i>

1286
01:21:04,734 --> 01:21:05,777
I'm sorry.

1287
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:08,363
It's just bad luck.

1288
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:15,370
Yeah.

1289
01:21:15,453 --> 01:21:16,580
Bad luck.

1290
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:30,552
Come on, come on.

1291
01:21:32,095 --> 01:21:33,138
That's a lot of cops.

1292
01:21:36,016 --> 01:21:37,559
Come on. Get up!

1293
01:21:38,643 --> 01:21:40,228
Whoa! I'm coming, I'm coming.

1294
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:47,110
What made your president change his mind?

1295
01:21:48,194 --> 01:21:51,865
This wasn't him. The guy doesn't know
how to spell Turgistan.

1296
01:21:52,657 --> 01:21:54,784
This better not be
what I'm thinking it is.

1297
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,245
- What's that?
- A coup.

1298
01:21:57,829 --> 01:21:59,748
Exchanging my brother with me.

1299
01:21:59,831 --> 01:22:00,831
<i>♪ Run ♪</i>

1300
01:22:14,137 --> 01:22:15,137
<i>♪ Run ♪</i>

1301
01:22:27,984 --> 01:22:30,153
- What is that?
- Three blew the budget on the Ferrari.

1302
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:33,823
- Sorry. My bad. My bad.
- Stupid.

1303
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:36,368
It's adorable.
We are not having a good night.

1304
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:56,346
I can't steer like Six, so let's avoid
any violent bullshit, all right?

1305
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:10,068
Oh!

1306
01:23:13,446 --> 01:23:14,614
Oh, shit!

1307
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:15,949
Was that a bad guy?

1308
01:23:32,048 --> 01:23:34,592
Shit.

1309
01:23:34,926 --> 01:23:35,760
Kill him?

1310
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:37,655
- Stay! Very dangerous!
- No.

1311
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,281
- Want me to kill him?
- No.

1312
01:23:39,305 --> 01:23:40,515
Hey!

1313
01:23:40,598 --> 01:23:42,976
- Cops. I've been kidnapped!
- I'm gonna kill him.

1314
01:23:43,059 --> 01:23:45,270
- And I'm gonna let you.
- They are kidnapping me!

1315
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:47,593
Hey, cops, where are you going?

1316
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:53,361
Whoa. Shit.

1317
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:15,550
Shit.

1318
01:24:16,926 --> 01:24:17,761
Fuck.

1319
01:24:17,844 --> 01:24:20,138
Throw the grenade up there!

1320
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:29,898
Whoa!

1321
01:24:58,885 --> 01:25:00,345
Fuck.

1322
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:01,471
<i>I made it across.</i>

1323
01:25:01,971 --> 01:25:03,181
<i>Southwest side.</i>

1324
01:25:04,557 --> 01:25:05,975
Where are you guys?

1325
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:07,059
No!

1326
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:13,274
- Stop the car.
<i>- </i>No, don't stop the car.

1327
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:14,526
- We're leaving him.
- What?

1328
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:15,485
- No.
- He's on his own.

1329
01:25:15,568 --> 01:25:17,445
- Stop the car.
- Do not stop the car.

1330
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:19,656
- Stop the fucking car!
- Hey! Don't fucking do it!

1331
01:25:21,574 --> 01:25:23,076
He cocked it first.

1332
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:25,912
I'm not doing this again.
I'm not leaving him behind.

1333
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:28,206
We're all we got.

1334
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,400
- Get out the car.
- He's in the net up there.

1335
01:25:42,887 --> 01:25:45,181
Dude, little space.

1336
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:52,229
Die!

1337
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:01,573
Come on. Hurry, Seven.

1338
01:26:04,742 --> 01:26:05,994
Come on, come on, come on.

1339
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:08,746
I'm gonna kill you.

1340
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:10,415
No!

1341
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:13,835
Hurry, Seven.

1342
01:26:32,478 --> 01:26:33,479
Nice shot.

1343
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:36,316
Carvers.

1344
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:41,654
Cleavers.

1345
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:53,333
They're making war on me.

1346
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:56,461
My most loyal generals are dead,
and my brother is loose.

1347
01:26:56,544 --> 01:26:58,338
They're not shadows. They're men.

1348
01:26:58,421 --> 01:26:59,464
And women.

1349
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:02,508
Uncommonly skilled
in covering their tracks.

1350
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:05,362
Outside of their violence against you,
they appear not to exist at all.

1351
01:27:05,386 --> 01:27:08,181
You mean to tell me in a world
of cell phones and Internet browsers...

1352
01:27:08,264 --> 01:27:10,475
We have found no digital footprints.

1353
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:14,312
She was declared dead seven months ago.

1354
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:15,980
Your firm is helpless.

1355
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:19,776
I find people by examining their links
to the world,

1356
01:27:19,859 --> 01:27:23,988
to families, friends,
employers, organizations.

1357
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:28,868
Once I find a thread, I pull it
and keep pulling it until I reach them

1358
01:27:28,952 --> 01:27:30,954
so I can have my teams kill them.

1359
01:27:31,037 --> 01:27:32,247
How is this different?

1360
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:37,001
Whatever links to the world
these people had, they've cut them.

1361
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:38,878
And yet they walk the Earth
like you and me.

1362
01:27:39,754 --> 01:27:42,715
They have blood types and birthdays
and sock drawers.

1363
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:45,343
This ghost act is itself a form of hubris.

1364
01:27:45,885 --> 01:27:48,429
If they exist, they can be made not to.

1365
01:27:53,559 --> 01:27:54,559
We're good.

1366
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:10,591
This shit isn't sitting right with me,
man. You made me a promise.

1367
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:12,418
You said you'd always let me
pull the trigger.

1368
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:14,289
Yeah. Yeah, I did say that.

1369
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:16,165
- Yeah, you remember that?
- Okay, easy.

1370
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:18,918
- You know why we don't use names?
- Why?

1371
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:20,562
No offense, Four, I'm glad you're alive,

1372
01:28:20,586 --> 01:28:23,506
but you left us out on that street there.
We were totally exposed.

1373
01:28:23,589 --> 01:28:26,109
If I was up there, I'd expect you
to leave me and not turn back.

1374
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:28,070
- Fuck that.
- Mission is more important than the man.

1375
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:29,095
Fuck the mission.

1376
01:28:30,888 --> 01:28:33,266
- You don't leave a soldier behind.
- I got news for you.

1377
01:28:33,349 --> 01:28:36,686
Seven, you're not a soldier anymore.
She's not a doctor.

1378
01:28:36,769 --> 01:28:38,062
She's not a spy.

1379
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:41,149
- He's not a hitman. And I'm not a CEO.
- A rich asshole?

1380
01:28:41,232 --> 01:28:42,775
Oh, I am still a rich asshole.

1381
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:44,670
- I just don't have a name.
- You are. What's your name?

1382
01:28:44,694 --> 01:28:46,946
- Don't tell him.
- I'm Blaine.

1383
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:48,406
I just saved your life.

1384
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:50,325
What's your name?

1385
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:53,410
It's Billy.

1386
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:54,370
Billy.

1387
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:56,456
- You look like a Billy.
- You look like a Four.

1388
01:28:57,749 --> 01:28:58,791
I'm Javier.

1389
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:00,334
Camille.

1390
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:01,752
Amelia.

1391
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:04,922
It's nice to meet everyone. That's great.

1392
01:29:05,631 --> 01:29:07,216
That's great. Let's go, let's go.

1393
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:10,177
Great.

1394
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:14,057
<i>Hey, ghosts.
This is Seven, AKA Blaine.</i>

1395
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:16,392
<i>We're below radar,
we're entering Turgistan airspace.</i>

1396
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:18,353
<i>That gives us four days
till Day of the Dead.</i>

1397
01:29:24,317 --> 01:29:25,902
<i>Concentric circles.</i>

1398
01:29:25,985 --> 01:29:28,696
<i>Your enemy's radius of operations
is shrinking.</i>

1399
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:29,906
<i>Thirty-eight hours ago,</i>

1400
01:29:29,989 --> 01:29:33,326
an unidentified aircraft vanished
off-radar near Tyrus.

1401
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:37,622
<i>It filed no flight plan,
it ignored control and then disappeared.</i>

1402
01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:50,718
Two, Three, you hustling?

1403
01:29:51,135 --> 01:29:52,178
<i>Speed it up.</i>

1404
01:29:53,513 --> 01:29:54,347
Don't drop it.

1405
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:55,848
It's a two-block walk. Come on.

1406
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:01,646
Funny guy. What is your number?

1407
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:04,857
One, Two, Three? Whatever it is.
My number is Zero.

1408
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:06,818
I'm doing jack ass here.

1409
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:11,280
You got the biggest job of all 'cause
none of this matters if you don't step up.

1410
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:13,199
They will catch all of us!

1411
01:30:13,282 --> 01:30:14,492
Can I ask you something?

1412
01:30:14,575 --> 01:30:16,994
If you had one shot,

1413
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:19,580
one opportunity
to seize everything that you ever wanted

1414
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:23,084
in one moment,
would you capture it or let it slip?

1415
01:30:27,338 --> 01:30:28,338
Was that, uh...

1416
01:30:28,798 --> 01:30:29,798
Was that Eminem?

1417
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:33,594
- Yes.
- You gave me fucking goosebumps.

1418
01:30:34,762 --> 01:30:38,057
If I do whatever you're asking me to do,
my brother will cut off my head.

1419
01:30:38,141 --> 01:30:41,102
<i>And he loves cutting heads.
And believe me,</i>

1420
01:30:41,185 --> 01:30:43,729
<i>compared to what he will do
with you ghosts, this is nothing.</i>

1421
01:30:43,813 --> 01:30:45,690
Arm them. Click to the right.

1422
01:30:47,316 --> 01:30:49,777
I wonder how many people you have to kill
to get one of these.

1423
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:02,623
We're at the TV relay.

1424
01:31:09,755 --> 01:31:10,755
Hey, are you afraid?

1425
01:31:14,218 --> 01:31:15,052
<i>He's in.</i>

1426
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:17,889
Three little words
have helped dictators rule:

1427
01:31:19,098 --> 01:31:21,476
State-run television.

1428
01:31:26,939 --> 01:31:29,317
<i>We're gonna become
the new heads of programming...</i>

1429
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,120
Inverter's in place.

1430
01:31:32,278 --> 01:31:34,030
...and you're gonna be
our new spokesperson.

1431
01:31:36,073 --> 01:31:39,410
After his national address,
he'll have a big party on his yacht.

1432
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:43,414
<i>If we're gonna flush Rovach to his yacht,</i>

1433
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:45,541
<i>we need to disable security at his palace,</i>

1434
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,793
<i>which means
a crippling surge of electricity,</i>

1435
01:31:47,877 --> 01:31:51,380
<i>which means an unannounced visit
to a state-run power generator.</i>

1436
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:55,510
<i>This one's highly defended, no back doors,
so we walk through the front.</i>

1437
01:31:56,052 --> 01:31:57,929
All right, guys. You're clear to the gate.

1438
01:31:58,012 --> 01:32:00,973
<i>Never underestimate the power
of a very nice suit.</i>

1439
01:32:02,433 --> 01:32:05,228
Remember, they don't like Americans.

1440
01:32:05,311 --> 01:32:07,146
Everything's looking good. They're in.

1441
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:08,564
Cheeks on seats.

1442
01:32:22,745 --> 01:32:24,025
Manchester.

1443
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:27,583
Manchester and Farquarson.
We've got a website, look it up.

1444
01:32:27,667 --> 01:32:29,794
Inspection is our business.
That's the slogan.

1445
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:30,795
And your name again?

1446
01:32:30,878 --> 01:32:32,255
My name is Mr. Worthington,

1447
01:32:32,338 --> 01:32:35,298
- and this is my associate, Mr. Ferijips...
- Ferjelpo.

1448
01:32:35,341 --> 01:32:36,551
Surjepo.

1449
01:32:37,009 --> 01:32:38,010
And he's from...

1450
01:32:38,094 --> 01:32:39,136
Turgistan.

1451
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:41,764
- Turgistan.
- Turgistan.

1452
01:32:41,847 --> 01:32:42,932
You want soup?

1453
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:44,976
Got any booze in there?

1454
01:32:46,894 --> 01:32:47,937
No.

1455
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:50,147
- Cup. Compliment his wife.
- Is that your wife?

1456
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:52,190
It's my daughter.

1457
01:32:56,571 --> 01:32:57,780
Uh...

1458
01:32:59,407 --> 01:33:01,284
It's hard living out here, isn't it?

1459
01:33:02,368 --> 01:33:03,995
She come out full grown?

1460
01:33:04,078 --> 01:33:06,289
Faked me out there
with the gray hair and the wrinkles

1461
01:33:06,372 --> 01:33:08,624
- and the orthopedic shoes and...
- What do you want?

1462
01:33:08,708 --> 01:33:10,042
An unannounced stress test.

1463
01:33:10,501 --> 01:33:12,128
Plants three through seven, they passed.

1464
01:33:12,211 --> 01:33:14,255
And I have no doubt that you will, too.
All right.

1465
01:33:14,338 --> 01:33:15,715
The only failure was at plant two.

1466
01:33:15,798 --> 01:33:16,841
You know, that was very...

1467
01:33:16,924 --> 01:33:18,009
Plant two failed?

1468
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:19,844
..minor. Yes, so, you know Mr. Noor?

1469
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:22,054
- We're trying to keep his name out of it.
- Yeah.

1470
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:23,598
Noor is a fool.

1471
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:27,017
Yeah.

1472
01:33:28,686 --> 01:33:31,522
- Noor is dead. Say he's dead.
- No, he's dead.

1473
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:32,648
He died.

1474
01:33:32,732 --> 01:33:34,692
Wrong guy. He's alive. Fuck!

1475
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:40,489
Just recover. Recover.

1476
01:33:40,906 --> 01:33:42,783
Yeah. He was found with a belt...

1477
01:33:43,701 --> 01:33:46,537
tied around his neck
in an unfortunate masturbating accident.

1478
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:50,791
Ferocious masturbating accident.

1479
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:52,293
It was very sad.

1480
01:33:52,376 --> 01:33:53,878
One, shut the fuck up.

1481
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:56,464
- What?
- Come on. We've all choked ourselves

1482
01:33:56,547 --> 01:33:58,174
having a little choke, haven't we?

1483
01:34:01,844 --> 01:34:02,844
Come.

1484
01:34:03,346 --> 01:34:05,222
And this is our finest room.

1485
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:09,226
It transmits all state-run television
and power to the palace.

1486
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:10,436
Very efficient.

1487
01:34:13,356 --> 01:34:17,109
Maybe Mr. Grace can mention it
to Mr. Bashir.

1488
01:34:18,110 --> 01:34:19,236
I doubt it.

1489
01:34:21,739 --> 01:34:23,240
Does it ever bother you, bro?

1490
01:34:23,741 --> 01:34:26,202
To mean nothing to anyone.

1491
01:34:27,203 --> 01:34:31,457
Like, one wrong word in there,
and they go find themselves an Eight?

1492
01:34:31,874 --> 01:34:32,792
Nine?

1493
01:34:32,875 --> 01:34:34,335
Why do you think I chose you?

1494
01:34:35,044 --> 01:34:37,129
A man whose longest relationship's
with a rifle.

1495
01:34:37,213 --> 01:34:39,632
You don't know my fucking life, bro.

1496
01:34:40,216 --> 01:34:43,302
You can't do the stuff that we do
and have someone you love.

1497
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:44,595
It doesn't... It doesn't work.

1498
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:47,598
Everybody's got someone
or something to lose, man.

1499
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:49,516
Even you.

1500
01:34:51,644 --> 01:34:56,315
No, I... I'm gonna leave this world
the same way that I came into it.

1501
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:58,275
Alone, thank you.

1502
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:02,238
You can drop the boo-hoo bullshit
'cause I see through it.

1503
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:04,949
You were good in there.

1504
01:35:05,032 --> 01:35:07,076
- I know.
- Yeah, that Turkmen was garbage.

1505
01:35:07,159 --> 01:35:08,494
Fuck you.

1506
01:35:09,245 --> 01:35:11,622
You've got a soul, man.
You should let it out.

1507
01:35:19,755 --> 01:35:21,966
<i>Presidente, </i>we go live in five minutes.

1508
01:35:29,974 --> 01:35:31,174
<i>When the shit goes down,</i>

1510
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:36,313
<i>They store him in a stateroom.</i>

1511
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:37,898
<i>It's hardened like a bunker.</i>

1512
01:35:40,484 --> 01:35:43,446
Wow! It's so <i>big!</i>

1513
01:35:43,529 --> 01:35:46,574
It's not the length
of the boat...

1514
01:35:47,074 --> 01:35:49,660
...it's the girth!

1515
01:35:56,667 --> 01:35:57,947
How you doing, Mama?

1516
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:01,338
Three, set at palace.

1517
01:36:09,638 --> 01:36:10,806
It's beautiful.

1518
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:12,433
Thank you.

1519
01:36:13,142 --> 01:36:14,477
I just threw it together.

1520
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:17,897
The route to Rovach's boat
will take about an hour.

1521
01:36:19,106 --> 01:36:20,441
We need every second.

1522
01:36:25,154 --> 01:36:26,989
You know, none of us will be remembered.

1523
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:32,661
What's about to happen will.

1524
01:36:35,581 --> 01:36:38,250
Little things, they add up to big things.

1525
01:36:43,255 --> 01:36:44,840

<i>Bring in strike fighters to escort me.</i>

1576
01:39:45,854 --> 01:39:48,315
Replace traditional ordnance
with sarin VX.

1577
01:39:48,732 --> 01:39:50,275
Start on my word.

1578
01:39:54,279 --> 01:39:56,740
Why is it always me
that has to do this kind of shit, man?

1579
01:39:58,993 --> 01:40:02,329
Hey, Chatty Cathy.
Do you know what over and out means?

1580
01:40:02,413 --> 01:40:04,498
I'm a little afraid.
What do you want me to say?

1581
01:40:04,581 --> 01:40:06,208
Conversation's over. <i>Capisce?</i>

1582
01:40:06,291 --> 01:40:09,503
There's a lot of bad guys,
and I'm the only good guy here. Move!

1583
01:40:09,586 --> 01:40:11,880
<i>If I die, just tell my mother
that I love her.</i>

1584
01:40:11,964 --> 01:40:13,298
Over and out!

1585
01:40:17,302 --> 01:40:19,638
They poke the nest,
they're gonna find hornets.

1586
01:40:19,722 --> 01:40:22,474
<i>♪ This time I won't let go ♪</i>

1587
01:40:22,558 --> 01:40:23,934
<i>♪ I'd rather die ♪</i>

1588
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:26,937
<i>♪ Than give up the fight

1593
01:40:37,239 --> 01:40:39,575
Oh, okay, <i>papi. </i>They have fighter jets.

1594
01:40:39,658 --> 01:40:41,201
<i>They have fighter jets, man.</i>

1595
01:40:45,122 --> 01:40:46,122
Is this gonna work?

1596
01:40:46,582 --> 01:40:47,582
Well...

1597
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:51,628
I hope so.

1598
01:40:51,712 --> 01:40:52,588
We better hurry.

1599
01:41:08,937 --> 01:41:09,937
Where'd you get these?

1600
01:41:10,689 --> 01:41:11,774
It's the pro shit.

1601
01:41:12,274 --> 01:41:13,609
Ghost guns.

1602
01:41:13,692 --> 01:41:16,445
Ceramic barrels,
plastic frames, plastic mags.

1603
01:41:24,661 --> 01:41:26,455
These are no longer my people.

1604
01:41:26,538 --> 01:41:28,415
Through that crowd. Through that crowd!

1605
01:41:34,004 --> 01:41:35,255
No, you evil fuck!

1606
01:41:49,269 --> 01:41:51,480
This is where you ask me if I'm afraid.

1607
01:41:51,563 --> 01:41:53,565
Right now, I'm shit scared.

1608
01:42:03,784 --> 01:42:06,328
Dropping one! Two!

1609
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:08,997
Three! Four!

1610
01:42:15,337 --> 01:42:16,337
Drive. Drive fast.

1611
01:42:29,059 --> 01:42:30,435
What's the status, Three?

1612
01:42:30,519 --> 01:42:33,063
I'm good. Just making the world
a better place, that's all.

1613
01:42:48,245 --> 01:42:49,997
Go! Go! Let's go!

1614
01:42:51,540 --> 01:42:53,792
TOT, let's go, let's go, let's go!

1615
01:42:53,876 --> 01:42:55,961
Hey, Four,
you've gotta sabotage that anchor.

1616
01:42:56,044 --> 01:42:57,337
See you on the other side.

1617
01:43:04,094 --> 01:43:05,512
Open the bridge.

1618
01:43:05,596 --> 01:43:06,597
All the way.

1619
01:43:09,808 --> 01:43:11,435
Don't start the party without me.

1620
01:43:13,061 --> 01:43:14,313
<i>Time clock. Guys.</i>

1621
01:43:14,396 --> 01:43:15,731
Let's go. Go.

1622
01:43:23,906 --> 01:43:25,824
President. Ready to go underway.

1623
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:47,100
- Where did you come from?
- Whoo!

1624
01:43:47,304 --> 01:43:48,347
Hello.

1625
01:43:57,898 --> 01:43:58,898
Why are we not moving?

1626
01:44:00,776 --> 01:44:02,069
Cauliflower is very nice.

1627
01:44:02,152 --> 01:44:04,321
- I wanna move!
- I told the captain to move.

1628
01:44:04,404 --> 01:44:06,907
- There's nothing more I can do.
- I want to move right now!

1629
01:44:06,990 --> 01:44:08,742
He's German. He's very precise.

1630
01:44:08,825 --> 01:44:10,661
Start the engines. Prepare to leave.

1631
01:44:20,796 --> 01:44:22,464
<i>Side door is opening.</i>

1632
01:44:40,357 --> 01:44:41,900
Take the wheel! Take the wheel!

1633
01:44:53,996 --> 01:44:54,913
Lock the boat down.

1634
01:44:54,997 --> 01:44:56,498
Everyone, strap on body armor,

1635
01:44:56,581 --> 01:44:58,083
<i>and tell the captain let's get going.</i>

1636
01:45:00,877 --> 01:45:02,254
Captain of the Kismet.

1637
01:45:02,337 --> 01:45:03,547
I need military escort.

1638
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:05,966
Not so fast. We're gonna stay and party.
Get down.

1639
01:45:06,049 --> 01:45:07,926
Down. Get down. On your knees.

1640
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:10,178
- All right.
- Show me your hands, <i>por favor.</i>

1641
01:45:10,721 --> 01:45:11,763
Two hands!

1642
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:18,270
<i>This is Turgistan security
on the Kismet. Pirates have just...</i>

1643
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,564
<i>Comms cut. We're good.</i>

1644
01:45:27,195 --> 01:45:28,697
<i>- Bonjour.</i>
- Hi.

1645
01:45:28,780 --> 01:45:29,780
- Hey.
- Hi.

1646
01:45:33,368 --> 01:45:34,411
Hey, <i>papi.</i>

1647
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:45,964
Listen closely.

1648
01:45:47,049 --> 01:45:48,383
The enemy is us.

1649
01:45:49,051 --> 01:45:51,720
We must target him not where he is strong
but where he's weak.

1650
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:54,598
<i>Hospitals, to take away his safety.</i>

1651
01:45:55,098 --> 01:45:57,684
<i>Schools, to take away his future.</i>

1652
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:01,480
Youth, to suffocate his hope.

1653
01:46:01,563 --> 01:46:02,397
Stop.

1654
01:46:02,481 --> 01:46:04,459
- <i>Commence gas attack.
- </i>Get out of my way.

1655
01:46:04,483 --> 01:46:05,483
<i>Do it now.</i>

1656
01:46:06,651 --> 01:46:07,736
Do it!

1657
01:46:08,153 --> 01:46:09,153
<i>I said do...</i>

1658
01:46:09,654 --> 01:46:11,073
Join me, brothers.

1659
01:46:11,156 --> 01:46:13,450
So you don't have to kill
your own people again.

1660
01:46:14,576 --> 01:46:17,162
Tell the military to back away
from that boat.

1661
01:46:17,704 --> 01:46:21,166
Together, we will bring peace
to our beloved country.

1662
01:46:22,084 --> 01:46:23,085
We're good.

1663
01:46:24,252 --> 01:46:25,837
Guards have chest armor.

1664
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:26,921
Yes, they do.

1665
01:46:26,963 --> 01:46:29,841
We got the fancy composite Kevlar.
I hope this works, man.

1666
01:46:29,925 --> 01:46:32,165
- It'll work.
- They have some fancy food up there.

1667
01:46:32,219 --> 01:46:34,179
Really? Tell me more about that.
Don't hold back.

1668
01:46:34,262 --> 01:46:38,809
This fish soup they call...
labu... labuan...

1669
01:46:38,892 --> 01:46:40,227
I'm fucking kidding. Focus.

1670
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:42,771
It's so delicious, man.
They put this little cheese on it.

1671
01:46:43,313 --> 01:46:46,942
Does it have to be on the walkie-talkie?
And we're all standing right here. Yeah?

1672
01:46:47,359 --> 01:46:49,069
Don't you give me attitude, okay?

1673
01:46:49,152 --> 01:46:51,613
- Over and out.
- I...

1674
01:46:51,696 --> 01:46:55,075
Don't scratch my boat with your guns.
It cost me one billion manat.

1675
01:46:55,158 --> 01:46:58,078
You're untouchable now.

1676
01:46:58,161 --> 01:46:59,704
This is the safest ship on the seas.

1677
01:46:59,788 --> 01:47:02,749
It's a panic room with deck chairs.

1678
01:47:08,588 --> 01:47:11,883
When I pop this,
the magnet pulse lasts for 15 seconds.

1679
01:47:17,264 --> 01:47:19,433
Welcome to the world's biggest magnet.

1680
01:47:22,477 --> 01:47:25,689
I was thinking that when this is over,
I want you to meet my mother, yes?

1681
01:47:26,148 --> 01:47:28,191
Oh, God. You didn't say that.

1682
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:29,985
What? Yes, I said it.

1683
01:47:31,695 --> 01:47:33,113
What's wrong with you people?

1684
01:47:40,745 --> 01:47:42,581
Ooh! Big guns.

1685
01:47:42,873 --> 01:47:43,915
Ooh, la la!

1686
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:47,377
I found the back doors to Rovach's suite.

1687
01:47:55,594 --> 01:47:56,803
Fuck!

1688
01:47:59,973 --> 01:48:01,641
Ah, fucking American-made!

1689
01:48:05,061 --> 01:48:06,438
The fucking chip fell out.

1690
01:48:07,105 --> 01:48:08,106
- What?
- What?

1691
01:48:08,190 --> 01:48:09,941
- The chip fell out!
- Well, fix it.

1692
01:48:10,025 --> 01:48:13,987
I can't just fix it, all right?
The phone is very fucking complicated.

1693
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:18,825
No. No, no, no, no. No, no.
Go. Go, go, go.

1694
01:48:19,367 --> 01:48:21,929
- Sir, please, we must leave right now.
- Hungry. I went for a dip.

1695
01:48:21,953 --> 01:48:23,431
- I'm important guest.
- We have to...

1696
01:48:23,455 --> 01:48:24,775
I just went for a dip, all right?

1697
01:48:24,831 --> 01:48:26,625
This is succulent chicken, man.

1698
01:48:27,083 --> 01:48:28,877
- Show me your hands.
- This couscous?

1699
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:31,171
Show me your hands!

1700
01:48:33,423 --> 01:48:34,423
Fine.

1701
01:48:35,675 --> 01:48:36,676
Hey.

1702
01:48:37,135 --> 01:48:38,178
You know what?

1703
01:48:39,346 --> 01:48:40,972
I would love to meet your mother.

1704
01:48:41,723 --> 01:48:42,891
Really?

1705
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:05,622
I'm really happy.

1706
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:08,750
Contact!

1707
01:49:16,383 --> 01:49:17,383
Come on.

1708
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:26,540
- <i>What the fuck?
- One!</i>

1709
01:49:28,687 --> 01:49:31,898
- What the fuck?
- Put the phone down, and use your gun.

1710
01:49:40,282 --> 01:49:41,449
I got it, I got it! I got it!

1711
01:49:44,327 --> 01:49:46,079
Grenade!

1712
01:50:03,305 --> 01:50:04,139
Gah!

1713
01:50:13,106 --> 01:50:13,982
Oh!

1714
01:50:41,885 --> 01:50:44,679
Holy shit!
I mean, I wasn't sure it would work.

1715
01:50:44,763 --> 01:50:47,682
I mean, I wasn't "sure" sure.
I had a suspicion, but I, uh...

1716
01:50:48,058 --> 01:50:50,101
God, this is all so fucking dangerous.

1717
01:50:50,185 --> 01:50:51,185
Move!

1718
01:50:54,189 --> 01:50:55,189
Hey, hey!

1719
01:50:55,231 --> 01:50:56,983
You like that phone <i>now, </i>motherfucker?

1720
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:58,400
This thing is amazing.

1721
01:50:59,319 --> 01:51:01,404
Stop fucking around. We gotta find Rovach.

1722
01:51:05,158 --> 01:51:06,493
Oh, shit. What happened?

1723
01:51:06,951 --> 01:51:08,536
What the fuck?

1724
01:51:12,832 --> 01:51:14,626
This ship's some sort of magnet.

1725
01:51:20,799 --> 01:51:22,550
Jesus. What did you do?

1726
01:51:22,634 --> 01:51:24,010
You goddamn animals.

1727
01:51:24,094 --> 01:51:25,679
Don't look at me. She's the evil one.

1728
01:51:26,096 --> 01:51:27,639
- You did this?
- Yeah.

1729
01:51:27,722 --> 01:51:29,033
- Why?
- If we don't move quick,

1730
01:51:29,057 --> 01:51:31,309
- they're gonna pull them from the boat.
- You're sick.

1731
01:51:31,393 --> 01:51:32,686
Disgusting.

1732
01:51:35,522 --> 01:51:36,731
Let's find Rovach.

1733
01:51:53,164 --> 01:51:54,249
Let's go.

1734
01:52:08,555 --> 01:52:09,764
More guys coming.

1735
01:52:11,516 --> 01:52:12,726
Flashbang!

1736
01:52:12,809 --> 01:52:14,185
Move it here!

1737
01:52:28,575 --> 01:52:29,576
Move, move.

1738
01:52:35,665 --> 01:52:37,834
- The boat's moving.
- That's bad.

1739
01:52:39,919 --> 01:52:41,254
Mag!

1740
01:52:42,338 --> 01:52:45,091
- Magnet! Where is the magnet?
- They're getting their guns!

1741
01:52:46,718 --> 01:52:48,803
- Fix the phone!
- I'm trying!

1742
01:52:49,596 --> 01:52:51,723
The screen is <i>cracked!</i>

1743
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:56,811
We get it! They're dead!

1744
01:52:57,228 --> 01:52:59,564
Shit. They got our position.
We need to move.

1745
01:52:59,647 --> 01:53:02,025
Honestly, I didn't think
we'd make it this far.

1746
01:53:02,567 --> 01:53:04,110
Go kill the engine.

1747
01:53:18,041 --> 01:53:19,751
That is disgusting!

1748
01:53:19,834 --> 01:53:20,877
It was a flashbang.

1749
01:53:21,336 --> 01:53:22,462
Holy shit.

1750
01:53:23,463 --> 01:53:24,923
We should split up.

1751
01:53:28,301 --> 01:53:29,385
Go with him.

1752
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:31,471
Get me to the boat.

1753
01:53:39,229 --> 01:53:42,649
You. Where's Rovach?

1754
01:53:52,075 --> 01:53:53,201
I feel like a Jedi.

1755
01:54:02,919 --> 01:54:04,337
Five, flush him out.

1756
01:54:27,735 --> 01:54:29,737
<i>Five, find Rovach.
I'll distract the guards.</i>

1757
01:54:35,326 --> 01:54:36,326
I wouldn't do that.

1758
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:55,013
We're sinking.

1759
01:55:01,185 --> 01:55:04,105
I've got four guys on me.
I'm on the upper deck, and I'm screwed.

1760
01:55:07,275 --> 01:55:08,610
Who are you?

1761
01:55:08,943 --> 01:55:10,486
He's up there! On top!

1762
01:55:16,242 --> 01:55:17,242
No, no, no!

1763
01:55:23,333 --> 01:55:24,250
Come on!

1764
01:55:24,334 --> 01:55:27,045
Oh, no.Wait. Wait. I got it.

1765
01:55:29,130 --> 01:55:31,174
Big motherfucker.

1766
01:55:57,909 --> 01:56:00,069
I almost shot you right in the head.

1767
01:56:00,119 --> 01:56:01,579
Goddamn it. You go eat some food.

1768
01:56:01,663 --> 01:56:02,789
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

1769
01:56:02,872 --> 01:56:03,748
No, you fuck you.

1770
01:56:07,126 --> 01:56:09,629
<i>I'm in Rovach's stateroom.</i>

1771
01:56:10,964 --> 01:56:13,549
- Get me to the rescue boat.
- One.

1772
01:56:14,133 --> 01:56:15,593
<i>Rovach is leaving with a guard.</i>

1773
01:56:15,677 --> 01:56:17,011
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

1774
01:56:17,095 --> 01:56:18,095
Four, where you at?

1775
01:56:23,267 --> 01:56:24,143
<i>One, please!</i>

1776
01:56:24,227 --> 01:56:25,478
- Four?
<i>- Help me!</i>

1777
01:56:25,561 --> 01:56:26,561
Give me a hint, buddy.

1778
01:56:31,109 --> 01:56:32,860
Get me out of this boat.

1779
01:56:34,070 --> 01:56:34,904
What's your 20?

1780
01:56:34,988 --> 01:56:36,322
<i>Anybody got eyes on the target?</i>

1781
01:56:36,406 --> 01:56:39,200
I don't know my 20. Stay off the channel.
I'm going for Four.

1782
01:56:39,450 --> 01:56:42,286
<i>- Four, where you at, buddy?
- You're breaking your own rules.</i>

1783
01:56:44,497 --> 01:56:46,249
I thought you didn't have a family.

1784
01:57:02,849 --> 01:57:03,975
<i>Presidente!</i>

1785
01:57:13,192 --> 01:57:14,485
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1786
01:57:17,572 --> 01:57:19,365
It's a big ship. Say something, pal.

1787
01:57:20,992 --> 01:57:21,993
He's gonna kill me.

1788
01:57:22,410 --> 01:57:24,412
<i>Look, Bond, you gotta get here fast.</i>

1789
01:57:34,338 --> 01:57:35,757
There you are.

1790
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:36,716
Cleavers.

1791
01:57:36,799 --> 01:57:37,799
What?

1792
01:57:37,842 --> 01:57:39,552
It's a TV show. Come on, let's go.

1793
01:57:39,635 --> 01:57:41,012
Fucking millennials.

1794
01:57:41,095 --> 01:57:42,513

01:58:37,610 --> 01:58:39,028
They sunk my boat.

1811
01:58:41,030 --> 01:58:43,533

No one.

02:00:17,168 --> 02:00:18,211
From the opera, right?

1826
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:21,005
- Welcome to Act Five.
- I knew it.

1827
02:00:21,756 --> 02:00:22,965
What are you gonna do?

1828
02:00:28,221 --> 02:00:29,221

00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,270
Siddhartha Gautama,
the Buddha,

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,840
drew a circle with
a piece of red chalk

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,240
and said:

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,880
"When men,
even unknowingly,

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,280
are to meet one day,

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,650
whatever may
befall each,

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,550
whatever their
diverging paths,

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,450
on the said day,

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,020
they will inevitably
come together

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,620
in the red circle."

12
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,020
A red light. Tough!

13
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,600
Good news:
You get out tomorrow.

14
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,170
- Thanks for the tip-off, boss.
- That's not all.

15
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,440
Time's short.
The watch is due.

16
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,480
What's the game, boss?

17
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,780
I've known you five years.
You're the only man for this job.

18
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,160
Job?

19
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,520
Classic. Easy. No risk.

20
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,290
If done right.

21
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,930
And if not?

22
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,230
Sorry. I'm not coming back here.
- Well, I want out of here.

23
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,400
When you hear the details,
you'll warm up.

24
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,560
I doubt it.

25
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,370
What's with you, Corey?

26
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:24,440
With your pedigree and your time inside,
who'd offer you decent work?

27
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,910
Bastards.

28
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,070
They're ahead of schedule.

29
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,580
Leave nothing to chance, boss.

30
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,310
That's why I fixed the lock
so no one knows I'm in here.

31
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,790
I'm offering you the job
because I can't take risks.

32
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,490
You can't foresee them all.

33
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,480
Let's hear it anyway.

34
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,720
My brother-in-law's worked
for a firm for 15 years.

35
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,100
They've just installed
a new security system.

36
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,060
<i>One billfold.</i>

37
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,200
<i>Three hundred francs.</i>

38
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,760
<i>Three photos.</i>

39
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,740
One driver's license.

40
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,970
One passport.
- Expired.

41
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,810
One watch, platinum.

42
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,480
One set of keys, and that's it.

43
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,800
Corey.

44
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,630
Your photos.

45
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,520
The telephone, please.

46
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,830
Police here.
Get me the gendarmerie.

47
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,860
Have a map of the area?
- Behind you.

48
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,900
- Where are we?
- Mersault-L'Hôpital.

49
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,000
- This road?
- D23.

50
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,440
This is Inspector Mattei,
Criminal Investigations, Paris.

51
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,540
The prisoner I was escorting
got away.

52
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,740
Right. Set up roadblocks
on all roads

53
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,750
between Arnay-le-Duc,
Nuits-St-Georges, Beaune,

54
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,850
Chalon-sur-Saône,
Le Creusot, Autun.

55
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,190
I'm at the level crossing at Mersault.

56
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,950
Right, on the D23. What?

57
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,930
Then tell your captain to come down.
I'll explain.

58
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,670
One other thing.

59
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,770
Ask the prefect to put
the Rex Plan into effect,

60
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,100
and use dogs for the dragnet.

61
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,140
I'll wait here.
And make it snappy.

62
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,000
What do I do?

63
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,770
There are other trains running.

64
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,470
Bring me my coat and jacket,

65
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,220
the handcuffs and the two hats,

66
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,120
and get the train moving.

67
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,550
If anyone had told me
you'd be my wake-up call...

68
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,350
I was released early.

69
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,820
For good behavior.

70
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,590
Just a little poker game.

71
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,990
So I see.

72
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,440
If I haven't been in touch
for the past four years...

73
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,230
- Five.
- Sorry, five...

74
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:04,210
it's because during the investigation
and trial, you didn't mention my name.

75
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,010
So I figured it was better,
for you and for me...

76
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,980
You don't say.

77
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,410
Don't believe me?

78
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,150
Now that you're out,
you can count on me.

79
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,860
It's 7:30.
The banks open at 9:00.

80
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,860
I'll write you a check.
- No checks.

81
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,000
Loan me a few thousand.
I'll pay you back.

82
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,060
You're nuts. Wait till 9:00.

83
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,760
Let me give you something sizeable.
I owe you.

84
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,670
Just lend me what I need.

85
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,140
I don't have enough cash here.
Wait till 9:00.

86
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,810
And in here?

87
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,240
Nothing.Just a few thousand.

88
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,540
That'll do.

89
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,820
As you like.

90
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,360
I'll pay you back.

91
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,540
Sure you will.

92
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,030
- What is it?
- Nothing.

93
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,290
Hello, Paul?

94
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,990
We're closed, mister.

95
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,820
Ripping off Rico at home.

96
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,960
You lost your manners in prison.

97
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,420
Give it back, Corey.

98
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,430
Sure.

99
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,140
I lost, anyway.

100
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,010
Hello, police?

101
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,490
NICEPHORE NIEPCE INVENTED
PHOTOGRAPHY IN THIS VILLAGE IN 1822

102
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,240
Papers, please.

103
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,680
You just bought the car?

104
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:57,080
At 9:00 this morning,
before leaving Marseille.

105
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,380
Register it in your name
before next week.

106
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,750
Your address still the same?

107
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,990
Yes, 19 Avenue Paul Doumer.

108
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,860
Would you open your trunk, please?

109
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,050
Fine, thank you.

110
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,050
Go on.

111
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:19,170
- Still nothing?
- We lost his trail at the stream.

112
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,460
We've got to find it again.

113
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,660
Comb every inch of the region.

114
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,060
- Are they still searching?
- Yes.

115
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,640
But I think it's useless.

116
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:57,070
The interior minister
won't put up roadblocks all over France.

117
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,170
This isn't a terrorist.

118
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,310
Think he'll slip through?

119
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,880
He'll manage.

120
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,480
What makes you say that?

121
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,450
Hunter's instinct, maybe.

122
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,820
And for once the prey is intelligent.

123
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,020
The chief wants to see you.

124
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,060
You don't say.

125
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,600
As soon as you get in.

126
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,370
Really?

127
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,370
Good day, sir.
Registration, please.

128
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,090
It's not in your name.

129
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:21,950
I know. Your colleague warned me.
I'll see to it tomorrow.

130
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,660
Open your trunk, please.

131
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,040
They forgot to give me the key.

132
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,710
I can't open all my crates!

133
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,550
Expect me to dismantle
the doors, too?

134
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:51,660
Why not the wheels, the tires,
and the toolbox, too?

135
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,550
You're out of your mind!

136
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,560
You're free to go, sir.

137
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,350
Come out.
The coast is clear.

138
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,330
Hands up.

139
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:48,140
- Fine way to thank me.
- You see me climb in?

140
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,670
Sure. Or I wouldn't suggest
you get some air.

141
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,800
Why run a risk like that?

142
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,140
Up!

143
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,620
Answer my question.

144
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:01,650
After I lower my hands.

145
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,540
And rich, to boot.

146
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:26,310
Put your hands down.

147
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,620
This morning?

148
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,530
That's unbelievable.

149
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,930
What'd you think
seeing me hide in your car?

150
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,740
That you're the fugitive
the radio mentioned.

151
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:57,240
I'd just passed
a roadblock at Chalon.

152
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,640
And you weren't afraid?

153
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,310
What of?

154
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,510
Me, to start with.

155
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,340
And of them finding me
in your trunk,

156
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,210
for instance.

157
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:01,340
Come on.
Paris is your best bet.

158
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,910
In case we don't meet again, thanks.

159
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:43,140
Hello, Fiorello.

160
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:46,050
Hello, you.

161
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:50,780
Hello, Grifollet.

162
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:53,720
Hello, Ofrène.

163
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,850
Time to eat.

164
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,210
Come on, children.

165
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,050
You're sulking because
I was away for three days.

166
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:36,960
Come on, Grifollet.

167
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,110
Coming, Ofrène?

168
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:54,010
Come on, baby.
Come on, Ofrène.

169
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,750
Take the forest road.

170
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,660
Get out on my side.

171
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,650
End of the line, Corey.

172
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:13,250
<i>One move and you're dead.</i>
<i>Hands up.</i>

173
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:48,960
Let's go, quick.
Someone might've heard the shots.

174
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,690
- Only chance can help now.
- Chance hasn't had much luck.

175
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,220
Mr. Mattei,

176
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,900
didn't you know that a suspect
must be considered guilty?

177
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:29,130
Not for me, sir.

178
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:33,370
I've dealt with so many suspects
who were innocent...

179
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,670
You must be joking!
No one is innocent.

180
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,970
All men are guilty.

181
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:43,040
They're born innocent,
but it doesn't last.

182
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:48,880
Sir, my chief just told you
that only chance can catch Vogel now.

183
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,760
Chance and myself, actually.

184
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,190
Mr. Mattei,
I don't doubt your goodwill,

185
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,690
but allow me to doubt

186
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:03,060
your efficiency in arresting culprits.

187
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,760
Mattei has the finest service record
in 15 years on the force.

188
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:10,200
So what?
People change in 15 years.

189
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,570
You think I'm the man
I was in 1955?

190
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,040
We all change

191
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:17,780
for the worse.

192
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:19,710
I'm ready to resign if -

193
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:22,310
That would be too easy.

194
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:25,390
No, you're to find Vogel
by hook or by crook.

195
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:27,220
No matter what the cost.

196
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:29,790
You know him the best here.

197
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,090
Traveling together in a sleeping car
creates a bond,

198
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,930
even if the journey's cut short.

199
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,800
Very well. I'll find him.

200
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,870
I'm sure he will.

201
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,640
I hope so for both your sakes,

202
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,870
since you vouch for your subordinate,
my dear director.

203
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:51,640
Indeed. I'll vouch for him.

204
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,460
And don't forget: all guilty.

205
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,990
- Even policemen?
- All men, Mr. Mattei.

206
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:07,930
INTERNAL AFFAIRS DIVISION

207
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,930
- Was he kidding?
- He meant it.

208
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:15,970
It's his doctrine: Crime lurks within us.
We have to flush it out.

209
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,610
Strange man.

210
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,900
A man to be feared.

211
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,350
Where will you start?

212
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,280
The usual channels.

213
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,260
- Did you hear?
- I did, sir.

214
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,420
But why the name "Mattei"?

215
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,630
Blond hair, blue eyes.

216
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:47,340
That's not very Corsican.

217
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:50,040
Bring me his file, will you?

218
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:54,140
Along with his concierge's reports
and the list of his informers.

219
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:18,730
- I can't imagine him as an informer.
- That's because he isn't.

220
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,170
- It's not the barmaid?
- It is.

221
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,170
It's hard to find
a guy on the lam if he's smart.

222
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:31,180
Yes, I know.

223
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:34,320
Just find a way to bait him.

224
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,380
I don't even know the guy.
What's he bite at?

225
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,060
Spoons, flies, worms, maggots?

226
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,900
Is the fish you're after
pike or perch?

227
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:47,230
Spare me the fishing lesson.

228
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,230
You've got lots of imagination.

229
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,700
The neighborhood's changed.

230
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:55,770
Hoods use new tactics
since the open-air market moved.

231
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,140
The neighborhood's dead.

232
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:01,910
- Change neighborhoods.
- People know me.

233
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,050
Do as I do: Work through others.

234
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,090
Sure.

235
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,780
But tell me one thing.

236
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,990
You sure he's guilty?

237
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:16,730
I am.

238
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:16,660
So, Santi, forgetting
our old friends, are we?

239
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,620
Why come to my club, Inspector?

240
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:23,090
So that everyone sees you
and thinks I'm a snitch?

241
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:25,830
You really want to burn me.

242
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:28,370
Don't lay it on so thick.
Not at all.

243
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:33,610
Just say you had some problems
with the police over some call girls.

244
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:38,150
If you won't help me,
I have to try scaring you.

245
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:40,790
You've tried before to no avail.

246
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:43,750
Think so?
Don't believe it.

247
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,410
I've nothing to say.

248
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:48,280
With this clientele?

249
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:51,230
I don't know what's said here,
and even if I did -

250
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,190
You wouldn't tell me. I know.

251
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:55,490
I'm warning you, Santi.

252
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:58,800
I hushed up your little affair...
for the time being.

253
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:01,030
Don't make me regret it.

254
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,810
You slipped up. I have to use it.

255
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:07,310
Even if it's against your nature,
you have to help me.

256
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:11,880
If not, I promise you
you'll be in deep water.

257
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,520
All police have informers.

258
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:16,580
You know that.

259
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:21,520
You read the papers, listen to radio,
watch television.

260
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,120
Find me Vogel.

261
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:26,490
Is that all!
I don't even know him.

262
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,190
And this?

263
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:31,830
He a look-alike?

264
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,270
So you'll hear about him.

265
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,340
After this visit, I doubt it.

266
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:41,010
I repeat, tell them
it concerns your affair.

267
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:43,550
If you like, I can help out.

268
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,150
I can have you hauled in
for 48 hours.

269
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,180
That way

270
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:50,690
your honor remains intact.

271
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:54,190
- Vogel never dealt with the mob.
- But he will now.

272
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:56,830
To lay low, he'll ask for help.

273
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,760
You'll hear about it.
And so will I.

274
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,330
See you tomorrow.

275
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,320
Where to?

276
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:22,520
You, wherever you like.
Me, I'm going to bed.

277
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:24,880
I've been dying to for 48 hours.

278
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,570
I know.

279
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:55,370
A job coming from a prison guard
sounds dubious.

280
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:01,410
But we can start by checking it out.

281
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:02,950
That'll prove nothing.

282
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,680
But it'll be something to go by.

283
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:10,460
Okay. Let's say we decide
to go ahead with the job.

284
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,470
We still need a marksman.

285
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:17,560
That's why I'm talking to you.

286
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:20,600
Me? Get it out of your head.

287
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,110
Between shooting two men
six feet away

288
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:26,400
and hitting a target at 100 feet,

289
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:29,510
there's a certain difference.

290
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:33,380
It's the difference between
an amateur and a professional.

291
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:39,950
And, despite appearances,
I'm no professional.

292
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,090
I knew a really good marksman
four or five years ago.

293
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:48,200
A policeman.

294
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,060
A crack policeman.

295
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:53,730
One of the best shots on the force.

296
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:58,370
But the corruption of his work
environment finally got to him.

297
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,310
Between my prison guard and your cop,
aren't we overdoing it?

298
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:04,480
Go see him.

299
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:07,520
We'll take that risk.
Talk to him.

300
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:09,580
I remember his number.

301
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:11,280
He may not have moved.

302
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,510
Mister Jansen?

303
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:19,920
Speaking.

304
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,780
Excuse me.
I was in the shower.

305
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:25,780
Who's this?

306
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,550
You don"t know me.

307
01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:30,490
A friend of a friend.
Can we meet?

308
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:32,920
Yes. Of course.

309
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:35,330
When and where?

310
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,340
I don't know.

311
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,170
Around midnight?

312
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:44,000
Sure. Where?

313
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,750
Fine.

314
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:58,230
They killed each other
over a few thousand francs.

315
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:01,150
If we find out whose money it is,

316
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,780
we'd make sense of the killings.

317
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:06,450
We'd also have to track down
the other car.

318
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:09,980
If its driver has anything to do
with the money,

319
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:12,220
we'd have a better fix.

320
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:15,620
Think there's a connection with Vogel?

321
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,260
I don't know.

322
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:20,230
He escapes in the morning
between Marseille and Paris,

323
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:24,360
and the next day two guys
are found dead on the same route.

324
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:28,470
Well?
- The tire casts of the second car.

325
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:31,040
Two makes of tire,
three levels of wear.

326
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:34,970
The car's not new.
Probably a '66 or a '67 model.

327
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:38,180
- What make?
- Ford, Chevrolet, Plymouth?

328
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,910
Anyone asks for me, my name is Corey.
I'll be over there.

329
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:02,530
CAR REGISTRATION

330
01:11:22,010 --> 01:11:24,450
This friend wants
to keep a low profile.

331
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,920
I want you to meet him
to discuss a job.

332
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,790
Two whiskeys.

333
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,590
No, thanks.
I never touch it.

334
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:19,300
A double.

335
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,520
You're real scum.

336
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:40,450
Insulting an officer
in the exercise of his duties.

337
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,820
Don't make things worse.

338
01:12:43,330 --> 01:12:46,890
You know this arrests for show,
for your customers and staff,

339
01:12:47,570 --> 01:12:49,970
just to make things easy for you.

340
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,500
Just sit back.

341
01:12:55,970 --> 01:12:57,460
It's like this, Santi.

342
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:01,110
As I said last night,
I don't want to bring you down.

343
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:03,350
And I'm not changing my plan.

344
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:08,210
If I have to, I'll haul you in
every week for two days of questioning.

345
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:12,620
Inform your lawyer,
even though I can prevent you.

346
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:16,530
And phone your bartender
to bring your meals here.

347
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:21,790
Everyone at the club will know,
and my visit won't hurt your reputation.

348
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:30,130
You said even if I haven't an informer's
nature, you'd force me to help you.

349
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:34,110
You've got your psychology
all wrong.

350
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:37,440
Nothing can change
a man's basic nature.

351
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:41,480
I'm not calling my lawyer
or my bartender.

352
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:43,990
I'm not an informer.

353
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:08,110
Put him on ice.

354
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,160
He just pulled the classic
opening routine.

355
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:31,100
"He is not and never
will be an informer."

356
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:33,170
- Anything on Vogel?
- Nothing.

357
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:36,270
I'll speak to Santi again
before releasing him.

358
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,480
They know each other well.

359
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:41,540
If we don't get Vogel
in a day or two,

360
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:43,510
Santi will hear about him.

361
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:46,880
That's when I make my move.

362
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:50,240
And his phone?
- Round-the-clock wiretap.

363
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,430
No introductions needed.

364
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:10,930
How are you?

365
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:12,640
And you?

366
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:14,500
You haven't heard?

367
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:18,710
I'm a wanted man.
Escaping arrest.

368
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:22,810
- Wanted by who?
- Mattei. A classmate of yours.

369
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,920
Lot of good that'll do you.

370
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:36,100
Five people will be in on this.

371
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:40,260
The three of us, the one
who put us on to it, and the fence.

372
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:45,610
Only one fence can handle
this kind of merchandise.

373
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,670
He has to agree first.

374
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:53,350
Vogel has to lie low,
so I'll go see him.

375
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:56,850
And someone has to case the premises.

376
01:15:57,460 --> 01:16:00,390
That person will be you.

377
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:08,960
MAUBOUSSIN JEWELERS

378
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:24,300
Your bracelets, please.

379
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:26,940
Of course, sir.
This way, please.

380
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:38,910
What sort did you have in mind?

381
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:40,580
We have emeralds.

382
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:43,490
This piece is quite lovely.

383
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:46,890
Or perhaps sapphires.

384
01:17:55,210 --> 01:17:57,230
This is a recent design.

385
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,280
Very nice.

386
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:10,250
Watches.

387
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:25,600
That one.

388
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:33,280
We also make this kind of bracelet

389
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:35,070
with rubies.

390
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:44,580
I think a bracelet would be best...

391
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:47,820
for a very young woman.

392
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:07,270
I must think it over.

393
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:09,840
At your service, sir.

394
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:37,470
It all checks out as you said.

395
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,780
The bulletproof glass showcases
double as safes.

396
01:19:42,810 --> 01:19:47,010
No need to remove and put back
the hundreds of different pieces.

397
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:52,860
The showcases are opened
and closed electronically.

398
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:56,650
The wall key does exist.

399
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,620
It controls the showcases

400
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:05,430
and the electric eyes that block access
to the showroom from the landing.

401
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:11,070
There's no way in
other than the way you'll use.

402
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:15,240
But beware:

403
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:19,010
There are surveillance cameras, too.

404
01:22:56,470 --> 01:22:59,500
It'll be about 20 million,
market value.

405
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:02,370
Unset, recut,
with the platinum melted,

406
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:06,410
stones and gems
are worth only 25% to me.

407
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:08,880
Don't expect more than five million.

408
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:11,150
How long?

409
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:15,050
Leave me the goods for 24 hours,
and I'll pay the next day.

410
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:19,550
If you can find a better offer...

411
01:23:19,730 --> 01:23:21,490
There are few of you.

412
01:23:21,670 --> 01:23:22,720
True enough.

413
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:25,600
Well?

414
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:33,080
- I'll phone and come by.
- No, come without phoning.

415
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:35,070
It's better that way.

416
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:37,680
Anyway, I imagine

417
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:41,250
I'll read about
the merchandise in the papers.

418
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:43,510
- Probably.
- Precisely.

419
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:09,580
If I'd known about his release,
he wouldn't have hit me at home.

420
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:13,990
And three of my boys
would still be alive.

421
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:21,130
I didn't realize there was trouble.

422
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:23,300
Otherwise, I wouldn't have...

423
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:33,470
What's on your mind?

424
01:28:35,350 --> 01:28:36,680
Nothing.

425
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:45,080
Let's hear it.

426
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:49,990
Let's hear it!

427
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:10,860
That's it.

428
01:45:55,790 --> 01:45:56,950
Plouvier.

429
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:12,560
They're not much for talk.

430
01:56:16,670 --> 01:56:18,700
A lot of good this does me.

431
01:56:21,580 --> 01:56:24,070
SENSATIONAL PLACE VENDÔME HEIST

432
01:56:24,310 --> 01:56:26,680
DARING BURGLARS MAKE OFF
WITH 20 MILLION IN JEWELS

433
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:37,890
- Do we throw it out?
- Not an anonymous letter!

434
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:41,430
THE BURGLARS' NAMES
IN THE NEXT LETTER

435
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:43,630
If the follow-up comes,

436
01:56:43,730 --> 01:56:46,570
we may discover the author,
thanks to both.

437
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:48,700
It's happened before.

438
01:56:48,870 --> 01:56:52,100
- Paris postmark.
- File it with the letter.

439
01:57:00,550 --> 01:57:02,710
It's too big for me.

440
01:57:03,450 --> 01:57:04,420
Too hot.

441
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:08,950
I won't find a buyer
for such merchandise.

442
01:57:09,890 --> 01:57:13,120
I'd have to wait months
to show it in any European market.

443
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:16,490
No one will touch it.

444
01:58:12,260 --> 01:58:14,750
Thanks.
You just did me a big favor.

445
01:58:15,060 --> 01:58:16,720
I won't forget this.

446
01:58:16,890 --> 01:58:18,860
Corey won't forget this either.

447
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:22,830
He won't have the time to remember.

448
01:58:26,970 --> 01:58:29,160
We have to talk to Santi fast.

449
01:58:29,470 --> 01:58:31,460
No, he has the police on his back.

450
01:58:31,740 --> 01:58:34,400
He's got plenty of contacts,
and he's legit.

451
01:58:35,210 --> 01:58:38,370
True. And I've never seen him
make a false move.

452
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:42,040
All right. If you two say so.

453
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:52,820
My friend has to know quick
if you can handle his affair.

454
01:58:53,600 --> 01:58:54,820
His name is Corey.

455
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,970
Tell him to be
at your place at 1:00 a.m.

456
01:58:58,630 --> 01:59:00,630
and wait in the back booth.

457
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,740
Isn't it better at his place?

458
01:59:03,170 --> 01:59:05,540
Not for the first contact.

459
01:59:06,210 --> 01:59:07,680
He'll be there.

460
01:59:47,580 --> 01:59:50,210
You bet we have the evidence
and your two friends...

461
01:59:50,490 --> 01:59:53,250
Come off it.
Nothing happens in my school.

462
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:55,050
Your father's coming.

463
01:59:55,220 --> 01:59:58,680
He'll be delighted to learn
his son's involved in...

464
01:59:58,790 --> 02:00:02,160
I'm involved in nothing.
You're just wasting your time.

465
02:00:02,430 --> 02:00:04,020
Maybe not.

466
02:00:14,210 --> 02:00:16,510
He's here, Chief.
He's coming up.

467
02:00:35,700 --> 02:00:37,290
You, at last.

468
02:00:37,570 --> 02:00:40,760
Sorry to disappoint you.
I'm not here for you.

469
02:00:41,300 --> 02:00:44,270
Ah, the vice squad.
More hot water?

470
02:00:44,670 --> 02:00:46,270
- Not at all.
- What then?

471
02:00:46,540 --> 02:00:48,340
Nothing. It's my son.

472
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:50,470
What did he do?

473
02:00:51,710 --> 02:00:53,440
Come into my office.

474
02:00:59,990 --> 02:01:01,850
So, what's the problem?

475
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:04,220
My son Jean-Marc. He's 16.

476
02:01:04,490 --> 02:01:07,360
He and two classmates
were picked up today.

477
02:01:07,530 --> 02:01:08,660
What for?

478
02:01:08,930 --> 02:01:11,920
Marijuana dealing.
But I know Jean-Marc.

479
02:01:12,100 --> 02:01:14,090
I make sure he stays in line.

480
02:01:15,270 --> 02:01:16,900
- Oh, sorry-
- Come in.

481
02:01:17,210 --> 02:01:20,540
Ask Narcotics about the business
with the Santi boy.

482
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:24,310
Don't go thinking -

483
02:01:24,510 --> 02:01:27,310
Did I ask you for anything?
Did I promise anything?

484
02:01:28,350 --> 02:01:31,440
Anyway, if he's mixed up
in this marijuana business...

485
02:01:33,290 --> 02:01:35,090
That's it! I get it now!

486
02:01:35,690 --> 02:01:38,590
This is what you meant
the night after Vogel's escape.

487
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:40,860
Cut the playacting.

488
02:01:41,130 --> 02:01:42,460
Well?

489
02:01:42,670 --> 02:01:44,030
Sir!

490
02:01:57,850 --> 02:02:00,410
Hello, Doctor?
Emergency in Office 67.

491
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:02,240
Attempted suicide.

492
02:02:03,090 --> 02:02:05,320
Two tubes of aspirin
he found in a drawer.

493
02:02:15,300 --> 02:02:17,160
What happened?

494
02:02:17,430 --> 02:02:19,200
I tried to scare him a bit.

495
02:02:19,470 --> 02:02:24,930
Then I promised that if he told us
who smoked in his class, we'd let him go.

496
02:02:25,110 --> 02:02:26,900
- And?
- He told me.

497
02:02:27,080 --> 02:02:30,170
This was none of your business!

498
02:02:30,450 --> 02:02:32,940
This was all done for the father.

499
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:35,680
Why go overboard?

500
02:02:36,450 --> 02:02:38,820
Sir, I was just trying
to give you a hand.

501
02:02:39,820 --> 02:02:42,690
Now the case goes
to the Juvenile Squad.

502
02:02:42,860 --> 02:02:45,880
Just get him to the hospital quick.

503
02:02:46,160 --> 02:02:49,760
If anything happens to him,
I promise you a "promotion"!

504
02:03:08,850 --> 02:03:10,380
I just told him.

505
02:03:10,590 --> 02:03:13,020
This should simplify matters, in fact.

506
02:03:14,060 --> 02:03:17,220
I dream up this charade,
and it turns out to be true.

507
02:03:17,730 --> 02:03:19,280
These kids...

508
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:24,330
"They're born innocent,
but it doesn't last."

509
02:03:59,400 --> 02:04:01,430
Your boy's in over his head.

510
02:04:03,370 --> 02:04:05,340
Only you can help him now.

511
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:08,540
You see how?

512
02:04:11,480 --> 02:04:13,740
Will he be here all night?

513
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:28,930
What was the bullet made of?

514
02:04:30,670 --> 02:04:33,030
Lead, antimony and tin.

515
02:04:33,340 --> 02:04:36,300
A light, soft, low-density alloy.

516
02:04:36,770 --> 02:04:38,740
How did you get the right mix?

517
02:04:39,070 --> 02:04:41,300
It depends on the trajectory.

518
02:04:41,510 --> 02:04:44,840
In this case,
65 feet, 5/100 of a second.

519
02:04:45,310 --> 02:04:49,150
The time it takes
for partial fusion and cooling,

520
02:04:49,490 --> 02:04:51,850
before it flattens against the lock.

521
02:04:52,090 --> 02:04:53,820
The little tumblers.

522
02:04:54,220 --> 02:04:56,160
It sort of molds them.

523
02:04:57,130 --> 02:04:58,560
Understand?

524
02:04:58,830 --> 02:05:00,290
No, but it's brilliant.

525
02:05:01,100 --> 02:05:04,070
I studied ballistics 20 years ago
with Marchand,

526
02:05:04,600 --> 02:05:07,900
who's now Chief Inspector
of Internal Affairs. IAD.

527
02:05:08,600 --> 02:05:09,970
What's that?

528
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:12,130
The police who investigate the police.

529
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:22,720
One other thing.

530
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:27,960
I don't want my cut.

531
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:33,590
You and Vogel can split it.
You'll need it more.

532
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:35,350
I still don't understand.

533
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:37,460
I'll stick with you

534
02:05:37,730 --> 02:05:40,000
until you're both in the clear.

535
02:05:41,270 --> 02:05:43,530
And I'll see Santi's fence with you.

536
02:05:43,770 --> 02:05:45,930
Make sure all goes well.

537
02:05:46,040 --> 02:05:49,070
Why join us, then?
It was thanks to you -

538
02:05:51,180 --> 02:05:53,740
Thanks to you,
I locked the beasts away.

539
02:06:01,490 --> 02:06:03,290
Beasts?

540
02:06:04,290 --> 02:06:05,760
Too long to explain.

541
02:06:05,930 --> 02:06:08,660
I'll pick you up in an hour.

542
02:06:55,010 --> 02:06:56,570
Hello, Fiorello.

543
02:06:59,180 --> 02:07:01,380
Hello, Ofrène.

544
02:07:01,950 --> 02:07:03,610
You dozing?

545
02:07:22,370 --> 02:07:24,000
Time to eat.

546
02:07:24,640 --> 02:07:26,270
Come on, children.

547
02:07:39,390 --> 02:07:41,080
Where's Grifollet?

548
02:07:41,260 --> 02:07:42,690
Here you are.

549
02:09:07,110 --> 02:09:08,770
Did Santi fill you in?

550
02:09:08,940 --> 02:09:10,540
On everything.

551
02:09:12,950 --> 02:09:15,010
Think you can handle it?

552
02:09:15,750 --> 02:09:17,150
I think so.

553
02:09:17,320 --> 02:09:20,020
If I can see them,
and if you're not in a hurry.

554
02:09:20,190 --> 02:09:22,490
What do you mean
by "not in a hurry"?

555
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:26,420
An affair this big
has to be done in stages.

556
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,090
Don't let anyone say otherwise.

557
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:31,630
Above a certain sum...

558
02:09:31,770 --> 02:09:32,860
How long?

559
02:09:32,970 --> 02:09:38,100
Between receipt of the merchandise
and the first payment, not long.

560
02:09:38,670 --> 02:09:41,400
But count on a week
before the second payment.

561
02:09:41,510 --> 02:09:42,810
A week?

562
02:09:42,980 --> 02:09:46,610
I know, but it's the best I can do.

563
02:09:48,550 --> 02:09:50,450
And the first payment?

564
02:09:50,620 --> 02:09:53,920
Twenty-four hours
after you deliver the merchandise.

565
02:09:54,190 --> 02:09:57,490
Santi will be around
to vouch for me.

566
02:09:58,490 --> 02:10:01,760
- Where do I deliver?
- To my home in Louveciennes.

567
02:10:02,830 --> 02:10:04,490
I'll draw you a map.

568
02:10:47,640 --> 02:10:50,510
I had a good impression.
It seems aboveboard.

569
02:10:51,050 --> 02:10:52,600
Santi there?

570
02:10:53,950 --> 02:10:55,610
And Jansen?

571
02:10:55,880 --> 02:10:58,380
I'm picking him up.
He's coming along.

572
02:10:58,490 --> 02:11:00,480
- So am I.
- Don't be a fool.

573
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:03,090
Wait here till I get back.

574
02:11:03,390 --> 02:11:05,590
Tomorrow we clear out.

575
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:09,960
- Jansen, too?
- He's staying. He's not worried.

576
02:11:11,170 --> 02:11:13,070
To each his own.

577
02:11:13,400 --> 02:11:16,300
I'm off. See you later.

578
02:11:17,540 --> 02:11:19,170
Take it easy.

579
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:25,480
We've seen worse.

580
02:13:23,900 --> 02:13:25,300
Wait here.

581
02:14:12,710 --> 02:14:14,110
He's here.

582
02:14:44,150 --> 02:14:45,670
Come this way.

583
02:15:32,930 --> 02:15:34,900
Corey, take the bag and run for it.

584
02:15:37,370 --> 02:15:39,160
Take the bag and run for it!

585
02:15:41,200 --> 02:15:43,170
I'm right behind you.

586
02:15:50,080 --> 02:15:51,980
Why not tell him who I am?

587
02:15:52,080 --> 02:15:54,310
He wouldn't have left otherwise.

588
02:16:43,330 --> 02:16:44,730
You!

589
02:16:45,670 --> 02:16:47,100
So...

590
02:16:48,300 --> 02:16:51,240
stupid as ever on the force, eh?

591
02:17:58,670 --> 02:18:00,730
All men, Mr. Mattei.

592
02:18:01,305 --> 02:19:01,606

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,630
What will become of them without me?

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,629
It's like a stone, right here
in my chest

4
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,636
Him again

5
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,435
Go away, Arsene; don't stay here

6
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,799
Please go

7
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,708
But come back

8
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,118
The heat helps

9
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,436
I can breathe now

10
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:05,634
<i>Have faith in hope; three days,
Columbus told them...</i>

11
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,634
<i>... pointing to the vast heavens
on the horizon</i>

12
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,949
<i>Three days, and I shall give you
a world...</i>

13
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,958
<i>... you who have no hope</i>

14
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,199
<i>His eyes opened to see it...</i>

15
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,433
<i>... in the empty vastness</i>

16
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,433
Sing!

17
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,674
You promised, Louisa

18
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,674
Did I misunderstand?

19
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,592
Maybe I promised yesterday...

20
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,751
...but today...

21
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,908
You love another?

22
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,116
Answer me, Louisa

23
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,956
Arsene is making a fool of you, Mathieu

24
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,878
- 0f me?
- Yes, Mathieu

25
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,432
I'll fix him

26
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,629
Arsene loves you, doesn't he?

27
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,198
And you love him?

28
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,199
Is it any of your business?

29
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,640
It is, and I'm going to smash him

30
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,708
You won't; you're too afraid of him

31
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,433
We'll see

32
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,240
He's going on the the prowl tonight

33
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,630
Arsene had better behave himself

34
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,512
You want it?

35
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,432
Take it

36
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,674
We haven't finished

37
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,038
You'd better leave Louisa alone, too

38
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,709
Are you her keeper?

39
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,592
I don't like people getting in my way

40
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,038
Nobody pushes me around

41
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,436
Try something and see

42
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,797
What are you doing there?

43
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,797
I got lost

44
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,719
Why don't you use the road,
like the others?

45
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,830
Hadn't you better find that shoe?

46
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,151
We're not staying here...

47
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,436
...but get dry first

48
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,960
When did you leave school?

49
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,875
At six; I left before the others

50
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,117
Alone?

51
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,636
Anyone see you?

52
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,638
I don't think so

53
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,831
You went by the woods?

54
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,949
Listen to me: You didn't come
this way at all

55
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,630
You went by the road to buy some marbles

56
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,638
Marbles?

57
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,956
Some barley-sugar, then

58
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,718
Buy it? What with?

59
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,640
Say you found the money

60
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,116
Say you saw me coming out of the bar

61
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,198
I told you I'd been setting snares
at Bassompierre

62
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,356
Do I mention snares?

63
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,072
Even to the police?

64
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,876
I'll find your shoe

65
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,517
If anyone asks, we haven't been here

66
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,118
Nobody will be any the wiser

67
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,276
No ashes here

68
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,708
Listen to the cyclone

69
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,517
Come on, we'll manage without him

70
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,119
There's dry wood and candles

71
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,435
We'll keep a blaze going

72
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,798
There'll be a mountain of ash
in the morning

73
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,468
I'll say I was here all day as well

74
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,513
Do you understand?

75
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,038
Listen, kid...

76
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,879
I've got to go on and tell you
everything

77
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,036
Try to look at me

78
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,117
I may be drunk, but I know what
I'm doing

79
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,516
I think I've killed a man

80
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,878
Mathieu the gamekeeper

81
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,638
How did you know?

82
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,469
He was on the prowl tonight,
to get you, as he says

83
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,796
Well, I got him

84
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,639
We fell in the water, and the stopper
came out of my canteen

85
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,197
I gave him a drink and we were
mates again

86
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:28,117
But I don't know what came over Mathieu;
we were both drunk

87
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:46,269
Don't worry, that happens to me
sometimes; an aberration

88
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,957
I can still see myself holding the trap

89
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,399
He fell forward, his legs thrashing

90
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:12,030
Then he stopped moving, face down
in the reddening water

91
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,039
When I went for your shoe
and heard the shots...

92
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,032
I thought: He's not dead,
he's trying to summon help

93
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,715
It was him

94
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,639
I recognized the sound of his gun

95
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:32,435
If he really isn't dead, he'll talk

96
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,956
You must think up another story

97
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,514
I'll deny what he says;
newspapers like that

98
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,038
Perhaps I can help, Monsieur Arsene

99
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,189
Try to rememberwhat happened

100
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,353
Remember...

101
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,390
He was face down in the water...

102
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,113
...legs thrashing

103
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:05,269
I'll say I saw it all,
that he attacked you

104
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,478
Please listen to me

105
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,959
Do I say he was drunk?

106
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,639
You can trust me. I hate them.
I'll defy them all

107
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,958
I can't think clearly; my neck hurts

108
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,232
I'm going to have an attack

109
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,038
Were you singing?

110
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,277
I'll take you home

111
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,357
Where are we really going?

112
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,037
To your house

113
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,628
What about the gamekeeper?

114
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,831
Did you kill him?

115
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,557
What with? My gun?

116
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,951
With the trap, Monsieur Arsene;
you were holding the trap

117
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,277
Let me past

118
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,389
Where are you off to?

119
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,638
Straight home, I swear it

120
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,198
I won't forget

121
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:57,630
If you breathe a word of this,
I'll break your neck

122
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,040
I'd rather die than harm you

123
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,708
Harm me?

124
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,638
Where have you been?

125
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,035
Your father and brother are out

126
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,038
Warm up the baby's milk

127
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,752
There's a nappy on the line

128
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,197
He'll cry if you leave him wet

129
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,117
What are you standing there for?

130
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,120
I'll need you to put out the lamp

131
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,880
What time is it? I can't hear
the church clock now

132
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,436
The wind changed with the cyclone

133
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,751
What cyclone are you talking about?

134
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,393
It was a cyclone... wasn't it?

135
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,636
Listen, mum...

136
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,629
Make him stop; I can't bear it

137
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,391
I can't breathe

138
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:00,799
There's some gin hidden underthe sacks
by the cellar door

139
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,630
At least I can die painlessly

140
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,117
What a mess

141
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,238
Steer clear...

142
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,789
...of drunks and good-for-nothings

143
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,277
Mum, I've got to tell you...

144
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,718
Where are you off to?

145
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,960
I'm going to get milk forthe baby

146
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,195
She was a brave woman

147
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,838
Stop looking at me like that

148
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,113
Shit!

149
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,677
Have some coffee

150
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:22,789
So your poor mother's dead,
and so suddenly, too

151
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,913
Don't take it to heart

152
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,628
It comes to all of us

153
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,632
At least she didn't know
she was dying

154
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:31,914
What's got into you?

155
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,514
Little slut

156
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,072
Rat face!

157
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,276
What are you up to?

158
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,035
I wanted to have a word with you

159
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:00,792
Arsene and I had words yesterday;
he was drunk

160
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,636
0ur fight was just between
the two of us

161
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:09,950
But the police arrested him today
for dynamiting the river

162
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:14,275
Arsene says he met you in the woods
last night. If so...

163
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:16,673
Yes, he did

164
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:20,151
He really came to your house,
didn't he...

165
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,039
...to fix an alibi with you?

166
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:26,039
I saw Monsieur Arsene in his hut
last night

167
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,958
What were you doing there?

168
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,879
I was sheltering from the cyclone...

169
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,753
From the rain

170
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:38,471
So you're afraid of a little rain now?

171
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,356
Monsieur Arsene took me there

172
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:45,120
Where were you coming from? Don't lie

173
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,278
- From school
- At night?

174
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:52,519
It wasn't night yet.
Monsieur Arsene said...

175
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:55,070
He wasn't capable of talking

176
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,114
He could walk straight

177
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:58,091
Stupid child

178
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,073
He always does when he's drunk

179
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:06,119
He said you'd fought and that
you were drunk, too

180
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,869
So you took shelter

181
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,948
When the rain stopped I suppose
you went home?

182
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:18,195
At daybreak. I stayed there
nearly all night

183
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,631
You spent the night there?

184
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,319
I might have known

185
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:38,309
The poor child still stinks of gin

186
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,875
Arsene got her drunk

187
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:46,356
I could tell you hadn't been home

188
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,956
Look at your hair

189
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:58,949
Her eyes are still unsteady
from the drink

190
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:03,037
I think you've told the truth,
but not the whole truth

191
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,630
Leave us, Mathieu

192
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,355
Don't go, Monsieur Mathieu

193
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:14,229
Let her be, or you'll upset her

194
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:20,029
You wouldn't let that brute get away
with as much as a hare...

195
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:23,789
...but you don't care whether
he got this child drunk

196
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,198
That's a matter forthe police...
if the father lodges a complaint

197
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,719
Call that a father?

198
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:38,631
I can't question you the day
your mother died

199
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,877
But tomorrow I'll have ten francs
for you

200
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,639
You needn't tell me unless you want

201
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:52,389
Monsieur Arsene is my lover.
Ask him your questions

202
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,070
Is something wrong?

203
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,194
I must get back

204
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,274
Your poor mother

205
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,949
I'm sure you haven't a sheet
to bury her in

206
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:04,949
0nce upon a time the dead
used to be enbalmed

207
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,636
Now they're not even washed

208
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:18,632
I know the departed go to heaven,
as the curי says, but even so...

209
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:21,310
The dead were worshipped once

210
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,638
They were gods; real religion, that was

211
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,993
In here...

212
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,435
...you'll find some dresses

213
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:44,956
I've known you a long time, you know

214
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,956
They should fit you

215
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:07,437
I'll take this lovely sheet
and watch over your mother

216
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:12,631
I like the dead; I understand them

217
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:17,719
At your age, I used to be afraid,
but now I talk to them...

218
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,639
...and they reply... softly, quietly

219
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,073
Have you everthought of death,
Mouchette?

220
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:30,958
Are you asleep?

221
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:32,309
Your little heart sleeps

222
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:35,035
Try not to awaken it too quickly

223
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,516
You're disgusting, you old bitch

224
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:51,433
I only wish you well,
but you're too wicked

225
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,036
It's in your eyes... because you
don't understand

226
01:11:56,305 --> 01:12:56,877

2
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,240
Good morning, London!

3
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,960
It's a beautiful, sunny day.

4
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,880
Looking at the thermometer,
a very lovely 18 degrees.

5
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,400
We've got a classic tune coming up.

6
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,680
So, crack a couple of eggs
and put the toast on.

7
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,761
Carly?

8
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,330
Hey, sleepyhead.

9
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,085
You awake?

10
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,809
Morning, Dad.

11
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,321
Good morning, sweetie.

12
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,771
Want some breakfast?

13
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,280
Yeah?

14
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,805
Okay, see you downstairs.

15
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,045
What are you drawing, sweetie?

16
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,362
That's me, that's you, and that is Mommy.

17
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,880
That's beautiful.

18
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,800
Tell you what, why don't I put
this over there with the others

19
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,520
and you finish your breakfast? Deal?

20
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,681
Deal.

21
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,364
All right, hurry up. We're gonna be late.

22
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,000
All right, you have a good day at school.

23
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,160
Okay, angel?

24
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,040
- I will.
- Make sure you work hard.

25
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,160
- I always do, Daddy.
- Yeah.

26
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,520
- You know why?
- Why?

27
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,601
'Cause you got your mother's brains.

28
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,049
Okay, see you.

29
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,926
All right, sweetheart.

30
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,606
Good night.

31
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,400
Good night, Daddy.

32
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,760
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

33
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,449
She's growing up real fast.

34
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,530
Miss you.

35
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,562
Hey!

36
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,360
...head up the stairs.
Check in the bedrooms.

37
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,647
Check in the kid's bedroom.
I don't care. All right?

38
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,364
Just go. Fuck off!

39
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,686
Jesus Christ.

40
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,040
Daddy! Daddy!

41
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,600
- Shut up!
- No!

42
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,681
Carly.

43
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,003
- Stay down.
- Daddy!

44
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,090
Shut up!

45
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,801
Try anything, huh?

46
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,851
And bang.

47
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,040
- It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
- On your knees.

48
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,610
- It's gonna be okay.
- Now!

49
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,801
Hands behind your head.

50
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,880
Take it easy.

51
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,689
Shut your mouth.

52
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,200
Look, whatever you guys want,
just take it and leave.

53
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,000
- Don't hurt my daughter.
- Shut the fuck up.

54
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,321
- She's just a kid...
- I said, shut the fuck up!

55
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,204
There's nothing.

56
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,326
Where is it?

57
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,000
Where is what?

58
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,280
Don't mess with me.

59
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,521
I don't know what you're talking about.

60
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,120
- The coke! Where is the cocaine?
- What?

61
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,960
What cocaine? What are you talking about?

62
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,724
I don't know anything about any drugs.

63
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,965
I am not fucking playing around, man.

64
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,810
I don't know what you're talking about.

65
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,880
- What are you doing?
- She is not going to want to see this.

66
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,240
No! No!

67
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,360
Hey!

68
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,805
Now listen.

69
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,040
I will put a bullet in your kid's head

70
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,770
- if you don't tell me where it is.
- Sorry.

71
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,644
Please, don't do that.

72
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,160
Look, just listen to me, all right?
You got the wrong house.

73
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,561
No, man, I got the right place.

74
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,603
23 Kingsbury Grove.

75
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,360
No.

76
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,522
This is 23 Kingsbury Green.

77
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,560
This is 23 Kingsbury Green, not Grove.

78
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,320
Look, on the table behind you,
there's a utility bill.

79
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,006
It says 23 Kingsbury Green on it.
Look at it.

80
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,004
The utility bill! Look at it!

81
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,246
I told you, man.

82
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,364
23 Kingsbury Green.

83
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,725
Please, just don't hurt my daughter.

84
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,441
All right? Just leave.

85
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,000
I won't say anything to anyone...

86
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,520
You're not going to go to the police?

87
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,800
No, I'm not going to go to the cops, man.

88
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,960
Are we supposed to believe that?

89
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,440
If you go right now,
I will not say anything. Just go.

90
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,760
You've seen my face.

91
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,881
Don't do this, please. Don't...

92
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,080
Daddy!

93
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,600
I'm sorry, man.

94
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,045
Daddy!

95
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,650
You let her go.

96
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,080
Daddy!

97
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,605
Let her go, man.

98
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,920
Fucking let her go!

99
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,040
I'll cut her throat!

100
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,281
Daddy!

101
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,440
- I got you.
- Daddy?

102
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,880
- Daddy, don't go!
- I got you.

103
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,883
It's okay. It's all over.

104
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,400
- Did they hurt you?
- No.

105
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,925
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

106
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,127
I gotta make a phone call, sweetie. Okay?

107
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,287
Daddy. You're bleeding.

108
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,805
Callister speaking.

109
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,081
Hello?

110
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,481
Daddy!

111
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,043
Daddy, wake up!

112
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,241
Daddy!

113
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,925
Oh, God. Yeah.

114
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,841
Yeah.

115
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,400
This better be important.

116
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,560
Ray.

117
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,644
We have a situation in London.

118
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,405
Tom's in trouble.

119
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,161
What?

120
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,881
Hey!

121
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,041
Hey!

122
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,165
What the hell is going on?

123
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,130
Where is my daughter?

124
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,360
You took several blows to the head.

125
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,204
Been out for almost 10 hours.

126
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,527
- You're lucky to be alive.
- Where's my daughter?

127
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,800
She's fine, Mr. Parker.
She's in good health.

128
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,840
I'm Detective Chief Inspector Quinn.

129
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,320
I need to see her. Where is she?

130
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,402
Kavendish Place, at Social Services.

131
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,560
Get me out of these cuffs.

132
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,160
Yeah, I'm afraid I can't do that.

133
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,240
Why?

134
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,004
'Cause you're under arrest for murder.

135
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,240
And I can't find any
record of your existence.

136
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,891
What the hell are you talking about?

137
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,160
Those guys broke into my house, all right?

138
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,840
They were trying to
kill me and my daughter.

139
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,520
Mr. Parker, you don't
have to say anything more.

140
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,251
Just know, if you do,
it might harm your defense.

141
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,640
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

142
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,000
Do you understand me?

143
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,162
It was self-defense, all right?

144
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,680
I didn't have a choice.

145
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,603
Well, we'll see about that.

146
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,645
Hey, Carly.

147
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,327
Hi.

148
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,202
It's nice to meet you.

149
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,970
My name's Stacey.

150
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,962
What's that you're drawing?

151
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,003
I love your bracelet.

152
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,723
You know, I've got a necklace
that I always like to wear.

153
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,761
It was a gift from my mother.

154
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,770
This was my mother's.

155
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,800
My dad bought it for her before she died.

156
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,891
It's okay, sweetie.

157
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,844
You're safe now.

158
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,128
Bad men came into my house.

159
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,369
They hurt my dad.

160
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,328
He was just protecting me.

161
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,405
It's his job.

162
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,725
He guards things.

163
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,800
I know.

164
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,245
Where is he?

165
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,881
He's in the hospital, sweetie.

166
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,801
They're making sure he gets better.

167
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,722
And then can I see him?

168
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,760
...found in the oceans and seas
around the world. Humpback...

169
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,080
You didn't tell him you were pregnant?

170
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,400
No, I mean...

171
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,200
A neighborhood is in shock after
homeowner and father Martin Parker

172
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,088
took the law into his own hands and
reportedly shot and killed three intruders.

173
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,880
In this burglary gone wrong,

174
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,080
police are being unusually tight-lipped
about the prime suspect.

175
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,810
Emergency services
were quick to the scene,

176
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,240
but unfortunately not quick enough.

177
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,926
- The three young men were found dead.
- Oh, shit.

178
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,523
Gentlemen, I hear we have a problem.

179
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,330
Damn right we do.

180
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,765
That's unfortunate.

181
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,283
These guns you sold me
are a piece of shit.

182
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,360
You have a nice way with words.

183
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,442
The guns are Chinese knockoffs.

184
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,923
I was promised quality.

185
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,604
That's why I came to you.

186
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,000
I can assure you these guns
are of the highest quality.

187
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,128
I ain't buying any guns.

188
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:26,489
I'm getting my money
and taking my business elsewhere.

189
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,880
Let's see.

190
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,400
Royal Bulldog, 9mm.

191
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,720
Yeah, I know what it is.

192
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,760
It don't work for shit!

193
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,410
Short recoil.

194
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,080
Accurate up to 50 meters.

195
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,321
Where's my money?

196
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,161
Where...

197
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,444
Works fine for me.

198
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,686
Mr. Cooper?

199
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,361
I just got sent a UK news story
from one of our sources.

200
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,762
You gotta take a look at this.

201
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,640
A neighborhood is in shock after
homeowner and father Martin Parker

202
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,086
took the law into his own hands and
reportedly shot and killed three intruders.

203
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,480
In this burglary gone wrong,

204
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,160
police are being unusually tight-lipped
about the prime suspect.

205
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,571
Where is he?

206
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,646
How much did you pay for that rock?

207
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,200
All right, fellas.
Boss says this is a private party.

208
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,320
Drinks are on the house.

209
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,440
Thank you very much.

210
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,000
One for the lady.

211
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,280
To the boys!

212
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,486
Cheers.

213
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,126
Yeah, that's it.

214
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,480
Oh, that is... There we go.

215
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,160
He's got her. He's got her...

216
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,920
Let me just hook that up for you.

217
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,001
You're bad.

218
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,605
Give me some tips.

219
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,680
You've been schooled.
You've been schooled. Here we go.

220
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,840
All right, my turn, my turn.

221
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,960
Thanks very much, boys!

222
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,000
You're very welcome.

223
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,120
Come on. I'm going for a smoke.

224
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,160
See you in a minute, gentlemen.

225
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,163
Smoking will be the death of you, mate.

226
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,611
Bad for you.

227
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,930
She was so into you.

228
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,640
You're making money today.

229
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,880
Here you go.

230
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,450
Better all be there.

231
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,929
Go for champagne. Off you go.

232
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,522
Fucking machine.

233
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,240
You all right, sweetheart?

234
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,720
Not so fast.

235
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,325
Get 'em in. Get...

236
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,410
All right.

237
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,921
You ready, boys?

238
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,801
Hey, sweetheart.

239
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,681
Hello?

240
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,205
Mr. Bishop?

241
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,445
This is Charles Cooper.

242
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,320
Personal call.

243
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,480
This must be important.

244
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,520
Extremely.

245
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,601
I'm listening.

246
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,085
Martin Parker.

247
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,602
His real name is Thomas.

248
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,164
Thomas McKenzie.

249
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,444
He's an ex-federal agent.

250
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,960
- Time frame?
- Tight.

251
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,804
Then it's double my usual rate.

252
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,161
Deal.

253
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,330
One more thing.

254
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,610
He has a daughter.

255
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,051
It's for you. It's your lawyer.

256
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,324
- Hello?
- It's Ray.

257
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,164
Oh, Jesus Christ, Ray.

258
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,240
My face is all over the news,
and I'm cuffed to a fucking bed.

259
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,163
- You need to get me out of here now.
- I will.

260
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,640
But you're being held for murder.

261
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,160
Yeah, I didn't have a choice.

262
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,402
Listen, I'm on a flight,
two hours out of Heathrow.

263
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,848
When I land, I can
explain to the authorities

264
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,400
the confidentiality
of your relocation in person.

265
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,320
Two hours? That's not good enough.

266
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,731
What about Carly?

267
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,002
I'm doing my best. Take my number.

268
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,841
Nurse, I need to write this down.

269
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,440
All right, done it.

270
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,000
- And, Ray?
- Yeah?

271
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,411
Where's Cooper?

272
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,360
We don't know.

273
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,444
- I need to get to Carly.
- Listen...

274
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,361
Sorry.

275
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,962
Sierra-Delta-7-5, officer down in Room 4.
Prisoner has escaped.

276
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,520
Hey!

277
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,681
Don't move!

278
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,122
Get down on the floor
and put your hands behind your back!

279
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,131
Hold it!

280
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,481
I said, get down!

281
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,611
That's not gonna happen.

282
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,447
Stacey?

283
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,361
I'll be two seconds.

284
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,649
We're moving the girl
to a secure location.

285
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,208
- Why?
- There's been an incident with the father.

286
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,960
He's dangerous.

287
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,485
He's put three of my men in the hospital.

288
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,769
I can go... You don't have to.

289
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,201
No, no, I'll go.

290
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,686
You're sure?

291
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,680
The poor girl has no one.

292
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,960
The last thing she needs is someone else she
doesn't know taking her to a strange location.

293
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,728
- Okay, we need to go now.
- Okay.

294
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,360
Carly, we need to go on some travels.

295
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,805
Can you get your stuff?

296
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,441
Can I help you, sir?

297
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,200
Yeah, I'm Detective Chief Inspector Quinn.

298
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,281
Right. Let me see that again, mate.

299
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,480
You've got a girl here.
Blonde hair. Eight years old.

300
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,720
Where is she?

301
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,080
- I can't breathe.
- Answer the question.

302
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,480
Upstairs with Stacey, I think.

303
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,000
Which floor?

304
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,286
Third.

305
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,529
Excuse me, sir, can I help you?

306
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,400
Yeah, Detective Quinn.

307
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,200
Looking for a girl
who was brought here earlier.

308
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,406
Carly Parker.

309
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,560
Oh, I'm not sure.

310
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,208
You can try Graham's office, around the
corner, straight ahead, and on your right.

311
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,961
Are you Graham?

312
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,687
How can I help?

313
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,646
Hey, I'm Detective Quinn.

314
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,203
I'm looking for information
on a girl who was brought here.

315
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,610
I'm gonna need to see some ID, Detective.

316
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,763
Yeah, sure. Uh...

317
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,967
Tough day?

318
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,801
Excuse me?

319
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,800
Oh.

320
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,042
Yeah. Nothing I couldn't handle.

321
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,921
You know what, I, uh...

322
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,840
I think I left it in the car.

323
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,001
That's a shame.

324
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,441
Hey!

325
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,485
- Run!
- Get off me!

326
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,645
Thomas?

327
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,680
You don't know who I am,
but you know what I am.

328
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,491
And I know all about your past mistakes.

329
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,720
Now, Mr. Cooper is paying handsomely

330
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,326
for me to bring you
back to him in a coffin.

331
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,645
He blames you implicitly
for what happened.

332
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,324
Hey! Taxi!

333
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,800
What the hell? I nearly killed you...

334
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,280
- Drive now!
- What?

335
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,771
- Move!
- All right, all right.

336
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,120
Hey, you in a hurry, then?

337
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,960
Something like that.

338
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,240
Is there any particular place
you want me to drive you to?

339
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,560
Just head south.

340
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,090
You American?

341
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,881
Which part?

342
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,930
Different places.

343
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,805
Are you... You on holiday?

344
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,680
What?

345
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,001
I said, are you on vacation?

346
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,200
I know a lot of good restaurants.

347
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,360
Do you like Italian?

348
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,120
My mate has this beautiful place.
It's right on the river.

349
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,761
They have spaghetti, pasta carbonara...

350
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,200
It's bad news, Ray.

351
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,567
- Where are you?
- I've just landed.

352
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,200
On the way to get my rental.

353
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,040
Tom has escaped police custody.

354
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,200
What?

355
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,000
They have no idea where he is.

356
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,366
And Carly?

357
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,200
She's been moved to a secure location.

358
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,360
Where?

359
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,171
They won't reveal.
Tom is still a wanted murderer.

360
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,640
This is bullshit.

361
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,848
We need to locate them, or Cooper will.

362
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,280
I'll keep pushing through
the diplomatic red tape.

363
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,880
Just find Tom.

364
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,362
His last known location was Kavendish
Place, Social Services building.

365
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,565
Gotcha.

366
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,400
One call from me, and you are
booked on the best table there.

367
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,720
Hello?

368
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,006
This is the police.

369
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,970
Now I need you to remain calm.

370
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,680
Don't react to what I'm about to tell you.

371
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,161
Don't draw any attention to yourself.

372
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,090
Your fare is incredibly dangerous.

373
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,410
Now laugh.

374
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,200
What?

375
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,647
Just laugh as if I said something funny.

376
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,640
Yeah.

377
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,321
Yeah.

378
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,480
Yeah. Yeah.

379
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,881
Good. Now where are you?

380
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,371
Yeah, I'm on the A112, mate.

381
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,880
Have you gone past the petrol station yet?

382
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,000
No.

383
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,321
Pull in there, and I'll be
with you in 90 seconds.

384
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,881
All right.

385
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,763
That was, uh... That was the wife.

386
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,804
She gets worried.

387
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,080
I, um...

388
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,520
Yeah, I need... I need some petrol.

389
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,728
There's a station up ahead.

390
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,971
Everything okay?

391
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah... No, yeah.

392
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,003
It's all fine. It's all good.

393
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,120
All good.

394
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,611
Yeah, I'll, uh...

395
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,044
I'll be really quick.

396
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,731
Shit.

397
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,805
Where are you?

398
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,767
Fuck!

399
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,206
Gotcha.

400
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,767
Oi!

401
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,967
Ten grand if you knock him out for me!

402
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,370
It's good money.

403
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,371
Come on, let's do it.

404
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,524
Hey, you got a phone I could use?

405
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,446
Your phone. Give me your phone.

406
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,324
Oi, mate, we got a fucking phone for you.

407
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,241
He said 10K.

408
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,964
That's not a good idea, boys.

409
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,080
Hello?

410
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,207
It's me.

411
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,960
Where the hell are you?

412
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,486
Cooper sent someone after me.
I'm trying to shake him.

413
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,726
Where are you now?

414
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,169
- You got GPS?
- Yeah.

415
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,080
Okay, Royal Victoria Docks,
cable car terminal.

416
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,844
Meet me there in four minutes.

417
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,120
Seven minutes to destination.

418
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,571
Whoa, four minutes?

419
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,803
I'm counting on you, buddy.

420
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,041
Thanks.

421
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,080
God damn it.

422
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,567
Come on, Ray.

423
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,840
Come on, move!

424
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,160
Four minutes to destination.

425
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,571
Move!

426
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,806
Get in!

427
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,449
Motherfucker.

428
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,166
Oh, shit.

429
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,370
Jesus, Tommy, you're hit.

430
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,206
God. I'll be okay.

431
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,526
Who the hell was that?

432
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,720
Present from Cooper.

433
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,280
Oh, shit.

434
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,521
Where's Carly?

435
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,849
They got her in protective custody.

436
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,924
Apparently, I'm dangerous.

437
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,087
Here's the address.

438
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,247
- I'll check upstairs.
- Right.

439
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,520
Where are we?

440
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,444
We're just staying at this farmhouse,
just for tonight.

441
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,240
I'm scared.

442
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,446
What?

443
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,200
I'm scared.

444
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,327
No.

445
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,926
Hey.

446
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,680
You haven't got to be scared.

447
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,200
I'm here, and I'm not going
to let anything happen to you.

448
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,520
Okay?

449
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,920
I miss Dad.

450
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,650
Everything's going to be all right.

451
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,565
Why don't we get you up to bed?

452
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,440
You must be tired
after the long day you've had.

453
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,602
Doesn't that sound like a good idea?

454
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,886
Yeah. Go on.

455
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,605
Move upstairs.

456
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,560
We've got Carly's location.

457
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,801
Where is it?

458
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,003
Old Oak Farm, TN8, 2JR.

459
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,280
Got it.

460
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,360
Tom, we're going to
get you out of this mess.

461
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,440
I'll have your arrest warrant rescinded
within the next 20 minutes,

462
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,000
an embassy detail dispatched
to Carly's location.

463
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,285
Just get to the safe house
while we arrange extraction.

464
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,171
That looks bad, Tom.

465
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,725
In or out?

466
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,481
Out.

467
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,884
I'm gonna get you
to a safe house in London.

468
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,968
- No. We're not going...
- Then I'm gonna get you patched up.

469
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,920
Then I'll take you to Carly's...

470
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,120
We need to go and get her now, Ray.

471
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,680
You're no use to her
if you bleed to death.

472
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,800
Fuck!

473
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,042
Now, I've got men who are on their way.

474
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,240
You and your daughter's safety
is my only priority.

475
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,322
Why the fuck do you think I'm here?

476
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,120
I'm gonna get you fixed up, and you
and your daughter can be long gone

477
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,010
before Cooper and his present
even know about it.

478
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,126
Understood?

479
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,441
Yeah.

480
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,680
Yep?

481
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,280
Oh, come in, Sarge. What you got for me?

482
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,200
Oh, good news, sir.

483
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,601
Your work load has just got lighter.

484
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,127
What?

485
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,205
They shut the Parker case.

486
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,365
What the hell are you talking about?

487
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,004
You're off the case.

488
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,640
I've got three officers in the hospital
on account of this bastard.

489
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,640
And I've got three bodies on ice!

490
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,880
This is my case!

491
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,000
Not anymore.

492
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,560
This has come straight from the top.

493
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,041
- Diplomatic intervention.
- Nah.

494
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,800
No, this is fucking bullshit!

495
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,530
Call it what you like, sir.

496
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,246
It's done.

497
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,201
Fuck!

498
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,361
Mr. Cooper?

499
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,688
I must say, I'm disappointed.

500
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,360
He'll be dead before sunup.

501
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,000
There's nothing to worry about.

502
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,360
And the girl?

503
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,800
She was taken to a safe location
before I could get to her.

504
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,927
Where?

505
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,280
I said, where?

506
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,410
I'll know shortly.

507
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,567
You better.

508
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,284
I'm landing in 30 minutes.

509
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,801
I can walk.

510
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,566
Still the same old
stubborn son of a bitch.

511
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,004
- Which floor?
- The fifth.

512
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,320
Nice place.

513
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,562
Yeah, well, the suite
at the Ritz was taken.

514
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,680
Where are you?

515
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,000
- I'm at the safe house with Tom.
- Good.

516
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,920
I need an update on Carly.

517
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,520
We're mobilizing agents
to her location as we speak.

518
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,680
Good.

519
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,360
But just make sure Tom is okay,

520
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,480
and we'll have him reunited
with his daughter within the hour.

521
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,166
What's the intel on
the guy that Cooper sent?

522
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,443
We managed to pull an ID
from the Emirate line CCTV.

523
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,880
Who is he?

524
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,769
Goes by the name Bishop.

525
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,040
His file reads like a one-man militia.

526
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:27,360
Learned his craft at MI6,
though the Brits won't admit it.

527
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,762
And for the last 10 years,
the black market has been his home.

528
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,929
He's the most dangerous assassin
Europe has to offer.

529
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,440
Comforting to know.

530
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,646
We'll be in touch.

531
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,770
Let's get you cleaned up.

532
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,440
The subject's name is Carly Parker,

533
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,524
and is located at Old Oak Farm, TN8, 2JR.

534
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,644
She must be brought back
safely to the embassy.

535
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,841
Any new intel on Cooper?

536
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:06,000
All we know is that he
slipped out of the country

537
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,440
when we moved you and Carly here.

538
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,400
I mean, he hasn't stopped working.

539
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:14,008
He's still supplying the Serbs,
the Croats, North Koreans with guns.

540
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,080
Anyone with money.

541
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,640
We just can't find the son of a bitch.

542
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,120
You getting so close,
it really spooked him.

543
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,200
A guy like Cooper wants
to stay hidden, he stays hidden.

544
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,963
Yeah, well...

545
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,326
...he can't hide forever.

546
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,564
I admire your optimism.

547
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,881
This might pinch a little.

548
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,202
No, wait!

549
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,525
Westminster.

550
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,484
There you are, Thomas.

551
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,646
How you feeling?

552
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,087
I'll live.

553
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,480
I'll feel a lot better once Carly's back,

554
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,324
when this whole mess is over.

555
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,840
It will be.

556
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,288
Oh, and you can guarantee that?

557
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,730
It's not your fault.

558
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,044
Yeah, well, I don't see it that way.

559
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,884
You can't think like that.

560
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,564
She's dead because of me, Ray.

561
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,809
No, it was Cooper who did that, not you.

562
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,046
That car bomb was meant for me.

563
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,324
I'm the one that should be dead, not her.

564
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,764
You know, when I met Emma,

565
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,800
I was so deep into that world that

566
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,565
I didn't even recognize myself anymore.

567
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,124
But she was the one thing that
reminded me of who I actually am.

568
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,280
Now Carly's the only thing
that reminds me of who she was.

569
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,044
If I can't protect her,

570
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,487
then what?

571
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,080
You good?

572
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,525
Let's move.

573
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,641
Key!

574
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,645
Son of a bitch!

575
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,400
Ray, weapons?

576
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,481
Bedroom.

577
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,761
Clever.

578
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,600
- You ready?
- What's the alternative?

579
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,681
That wasn't the question.

580
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,845
Hello, Thomas.

581
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,204
Aren't you going to invite me in?

582
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,449
I know all about you.

583
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:25,204
Fed who got in too deep
and ended up with a dead wife.

584
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,440
Fuck you!

585
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:32,366
Now, now, Thomas,
there's no need for unpleasantries.

586
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:39,049
You know, after I kill you,
guess who I'll be tracking down next?

587
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,971
I'll give you a clue.

588
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,045
Blonde hair,

589
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:48,409
sweet brown eyes,
a smile just like her mother's.

590
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,283
You see, my employer, Mr. Cooper,

591
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,520
he wants to get to know his granddaughter.

592
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,761
Carly, is it?

593
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:04,411
He feels it will go some way to replacing
the daughter you took from him.

594
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,801
You're gonna be dead before
you get anywhere near her.

595
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,885
Well, he'll be landing soon.

596
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,251
So, you can either open up
this door and die quickly,

597
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,367
or you can drag this
out and die painfully.

598
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,765
What's it going to be?

599
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,526
Like I said, fuck you!

600
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,049
What do you want?

601
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,406
Tom?

602
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,966
I'm good, I'm good.

603
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,001
Come on.

604
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,960
- Shh! Come on!
- No, go!

605
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,246
- I'll cover you.
- No.

606
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,047
Come on.

607
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,000
Oh, my God!

608
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,081
Keep moving! Keep moving! Come on.

609
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,320
Keep moving, come on!

610
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,480
Move!

611
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,410
How you doing, buddy?

612
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,760
Hanging in there?

613
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,410
Come on, talk to me, Ray.

614
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,050
I got nothing to say.

615
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,762
Oh, there's a first time
for everything then, isn't there?

616
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,283
Go and get your daughter, Tom.

617
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,040
I'm gonna get you to a hospital first.

618
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,121
No.

619
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,160
There's no point.

620
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,000
You're acting like this is the
first time you've been shot.

621
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,080
Hey!

622
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,288
Hey, look at me, Ray. Ray!

623
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,609
Just keep the... Just keep
the pressure on the wound, Ray.

624
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,604
Ray!

625
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,485
God damn... Stay with me, Ray.

626
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,685
I'm sorry, man.

627
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,841
Sh...

628
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,360
- Hello?
- Stacey Miller?

629
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,720
Yup.

630
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,290
My name is Gail Callister.

631
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,600
I don't want to alarm you,
but I need you to listen very carefully.

632
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,280
I'm working with the US Embassy
and the British Police Force

633
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,725
and I've taken over the case.

634
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,800
What?

635
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,960
You can confirm with your superiors,
but I'm sending protective detail

636
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:11,440
to your location right now
to take care of you and Carly.

637
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,560
If Carly's father's coming here,
if he's dangerous, then I need to know.

638
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,320
Carly's father is a good man.

639
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,084
That's not why we're moving you.

640
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:05,570
Hand over the gun, slowly.

641
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,731
Now drive.

642
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,040
Sorry about your dead friend.

643
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:29,690
Shut the fuck up.

644
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,880
You're not going to kill me.

645
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,120
I am.

646
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,282
If you were, you'd have done it by now.

647
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,770
Only reason you're not dead is because
you're going to do something for me.

648
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:53,566
What was it like?

649
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:59,247
Undercover for five years,
being someone else?

650
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:06,207
Must have been quite the thrill
trying to take a man like Cooper down.

651
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,171
Did you enjoy it?

652
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:14,286
Or you enjoyed fucking Cooper's daughter?

653
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,441
Kill the engine.

654
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,931
Give me the keys.

655
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:48,880
Get out.

656
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,081
Now.

657
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,881
Hands behind your head, fingers locked.

658
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:14,890
Very scenic.

659
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,086
Move.

660
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,605
She's very beautiful.

661
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,770
And so precious.

662
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,444
You'll be with her very soon.

663
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,445
You know, it's like

664
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,124
one of the universe's greatest jokes.

665
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:15,967
All the money, all the power,

666
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,922
and I'm chasing something I can't have.

667
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,283
Emma was the most important thing
in the world to me.

668
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,200
When I get my granddaughter,

669
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:38,810
I will make sure her father
is nothing but a distant memory.

670
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,004
I'm gonna call your employer.

671
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,288
You're going to tell him,
"Mission accomplished." I'm dead.

672
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:17,760
Then you're going to tell him
you have his granddaughter,

673
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:21,322
and you're going to arrange
to meet him right here.

674
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:25,170
One entrance, elevated positions.

675
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,529
Cooper's a sitting duck.

676
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,681
If I do what you're asking,
what's in it for me?

677
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:34,964
Maybe I'll let you live.

678
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:41,411
You think you got what it takes
to kill a man like Cooper?

679
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:43,800
'Cause I don't.

680
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:46,360
I don't give a shit what you think.

681
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,720
Just an observation.

682
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:52,440
Your friend tonight? Dead.

683
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,602
Your wife? Dead.

684
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:02,571
You don't want to kill me,
not until I've made that call.

685
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,409
If I make the call, that is.

686
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,729
Well, maybe you should do it.

687
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,768
I'm sure Carly would love
to hear your voice one last time.

688
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,840
What are you talking about?

689
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:23,084
I'm talking about Carly
and her grandfather's family reunion,

690
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:27,522
which I'm guessing
is going on right about now.

691
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,040
Bullshit.

692
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,600
You don't know where she is.

693
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,806
Impressive.

694
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,960
You know, Detective Quinn was quite
talkative until I put a bullet in him.

695
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:51,160
Old Oak Farm.

696
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,561
That's where little Carly is, isn't it?

697
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,640
You guys from the embassy?

698
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:46,040
Yes. We'll take it from here.

699
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:47,451
Thank you.

700
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:50,841
Okay.

701
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,200
Agents Boyd and Reid.

702
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:14,930
Hi. I'm Stacey.

703
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,240
The girl, is she asleep?

704
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:22,685
- Yeah.
- I'll get her.

705
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,163
Wait, no, I can go.

706
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:27,722
She's been through
enough the past few nights.

707
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,400
She's scared and alone.

708
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,847
We need to be out of here in 15 minutes.

709
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,126
Okay.

710
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,930
We have a problem.

711
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:16,126
Oh, fuck.

712
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,120
Dude!

713
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,804
Fucking bastard.

714
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,760
Carly?

715
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,046
Wake up.

716
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,169
I say we need to get going.

717
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,366
How long?

718
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,564
Five minutes, Charles.

719
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:29,280
We ready?

720
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,249
Yeah.

721
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:32,960
I forgot my bracelet.

722
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,809
You haven't got any kids, have you?

723
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,450
We'll bring the car over.

724
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,240
Carly?

725
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,368
- Hurry up.
- Coming!

726
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:22,691
I believe you've been looking
after my granddaughter.

727
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:28,327
Your services are no longer required.

728
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,170
I can't find it!

729
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:38,525
Wait here.

730
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:45,121
I'll finish this up, Mr. Cooper.

731
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:50,649
I'm coming, baby.

732
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,885
I got it!

733
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,890
Don't be afraid.

734
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,800
My name is Charles.

735
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,882
I'm your mother's father.

736
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:09,209
Your grandfather.

737
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,401
Here.

738
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:16,526
Look.

739
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:24,651
You're my grandfather?

740
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,320
Yeah.

741
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:28,811
Do you know my daddy?

742
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:32,043
I know him very well.

743
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,724
He's a good friend.

744
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,887
He sent me to look after you.

745
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,131
You know,

746
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:48,206
you look so much like your mother.

747
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,922
My daddy says that, too.

748
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,929
You got kind eyes, just like her.

749
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,286
You know,

750
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:05,890
she was the most important thing
to me in the world.

751
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,649
She was very special.

752
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,850
Just like you.

753
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:21,000
I believe she's looking
down on us right now.

754
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,286
And you know what?

755
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,520
What?

756
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,001
I think she would be so happy

757
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:30,122
that we finally got to meet.

758
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:20,488
Hey, uh, what do you say
we get out of here, hmm?

759
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:24,690
Why don't we go somewhere hot,

760
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,360
where it's sunny all the time?

761
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:29,851
Like a vacation?

762
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:31,966
Yeah.

763
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:34,686
Can Daddy come?

764
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,691
Of course.

765
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:42,960
Come on.

766
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,920
Carly, this is Hannah.

767
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,480
She's very nice.

768
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,080
She wants to be your friend.

769
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,160
Hello, Carly.

770
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,527
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

771
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:01,451
Hey! Get him!

772
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:06,046
What was that?

773
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:08,481
Oh, uh...

774
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,200
Fireworks.

775
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:13,200
You know, they make me nervous.

776
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:16,124
Let's go to the living room
until they stop, huh?

777
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,364
He's gone into the barn!

778
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:17,561
You're a worthy adversary,
I'll give you that.

779
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,086
Don't worry, Thomas.

780
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:20,005
When you're dead, Carly will be
with her grandfather where she belongs.

781
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:02,447
It's been fun.

782
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,531
But this fight is over.

783
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:19,481
Fuck.

784
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,360
Looks like all those fireworks
have stopped, huh?

785
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:01,566
Yeah.

786
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,650
You like jokes, do you?

787
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:19,681
Let's go, Charles.

788
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:23,125
We're gonna be out of
this old place in no time.

789
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:25,641
Daddy!

790
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,651
It's okay, sweetheart.

791
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:29,441
I'm here.

792
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,842
What happened to your face?

793
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,280
Nothing, sweetie.

794
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,441
I'm fine.

795
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:38,490
Why have you got a gun?

796
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,764
It's just pretend, angel.

797
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,129
We were just getting to know each other.

798
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:49,083
Reminds me so much of Emma.

799
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:51,446
Don't you think?

800
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:56,961
Granddad and I are going on vacation.
You can come, too.

801
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,244
He's not your grandfather, sweetheart.

802
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:02,326
- But he said...
- I don't care what he said.

803
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,610
Let her go, Cooper.

804
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:09,485
Drop the gun.

805
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,320
I want to go to my daddy.

806
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:16,640
Shut up.

807
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,320
Drop it.

808
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:23,642
I'm not going to ask again.

809
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,286
Do as he says!

810
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,242
I've waited a long time for this.

811
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:46,601
Daddy, I'm scared.

812
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:40,401
You...

813
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:44,082
I treated you like a son.

814
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:49,600
You took everything from me.

815
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:54,760
I gave you my daughter
and you betrayed me.

816
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,763
It's finished, Charles.

817
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,007
No.

818
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,204
Not yet, it's not.

819
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:07,882
Please don't hurt my dad.

820
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:42,960
You okay?

821
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:46,522
I'm okay, sweetie. Are you okay?

822
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:48,201
Yeah?

823
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,127
Come here.

824
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:53,961
I love you.

825
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,641
It's all right.

826
01:29:58,200 --> 01:29:59,531
You're safe now.

827
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:01,361
Okay?

827
01:30:02,305 --> 01:31:02,155

Let's have some music.

Ah, yeah, just sit

00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,569

Bloody Americans.

00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,482
Why can't they just stay home?

191
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:02,438
Set up on the second
floor, let's go.

192
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:04,352
We're gonna use
the bank offices.

00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:32,351
Alright everybody.

199
00:10:32,352 --> 00:10:34,525
This is Chief Mattsson.

200
00:10:34,526 --> 00:10:37,048
- Get down, get down.
- Coming out.

201
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:38,656
You better not be armed!

202
00:10:38,657 --> 00:10:40,439
No, no, no, not armed.

203
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:42,831
What's your name?

204
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:47,090
You can call me

205
00:10:47,091 --> 00:10:49,134
the Outlaw, huh?

206
00:10:49,135 --> 00:10:51,351
Remember the Alamo.

207
00:10:51,352 --> 00:10:52,657
Woo!

208
00:10:54,396 --> 00:10:55,873
You alright, Vinter?

209
00:10:55,874 --> 00:10:56,917
- What happened?
- Oh, oh,

210
00:10:56,918 --> 00:10:58,221
you worried about the cop?

211
00:10:58,222 --> 00:10:59,959
Ah, how 'bout that
you guys, huh?

212
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,699
First thing he wants to
know is how the cop is!

213
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,177
Don't worry about him!

214
00:11:03,178 --> 00:11:04,830
Get outta here, huh,
we're done with you now.

215
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,264
Get outta here,
huh, go on beat it.

216
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:09,831
Beat it, you heard me.
Oh, God, we're done with you.

217
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,395
Get to the hospital.

218
00:11:14,396 --> 00:11:15,916
I'm not leaving.

219
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:17,786
Hey, you guys
having a drink or what?

220
00:11:17,787 --> 00:11:19,048
You wanna talk to him or me?

221
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:23,221
I would like to
talk with Ms. Lind.

222
00:11:23,222 --> 00:11:24,959
She here?

223
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,787
Yeah, she's fine,
stand up, stand up.

224
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:30,439
Is that you?

225
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:33,829
Where are the others?

226
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,482
I'm doing the talking.

227
00:11:35,483 --> 00:11:36,916
Alright?

228
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:40,047
Bring me Gunnar Sorensson.

229
00:11:40,048 --> 00:11:41,785
Now.

230
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:43,829
Gunnar Sorensson?

231
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,916
That's right.

232
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:46,612
From Kalmar Prison.

233
00:11:46,613 --> 00:11:48,482
We can't do that.

234
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:49,872
Let me tell you,

235
00:11:49,873 --> 00:11:52,525
What you can and
cannot do, alright?

236
00:11:52,526 --> 00:11:55,047
Listen to me,
just walk, just walk.

237
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,090
Alright. Nice and easy, get
down, real easy, I mean easy.

238
00:11:58,091 --> 00:12:00,612
Bring me Gunnar Sorennsson

239
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:03,351
by 3 p.m.,

240
00:12:03,352 --> 00:12:05,351
or I'm gonna shoot
her in the head, okay?

241
00:12:05,352 --> 00:12:07,698
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, cowboy,

242
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:10,742
you don't want to do that.
You don't want to hurt her.

243
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:12,308
Now you've come to a bank.

244
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:14,003
You want money?

245
00:12:14,004 --> 00:12:15,698
That's right, money.

246
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:16,829
Right, I want

247
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,829
one million

248
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:19,872
US dollars

249
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,134
un-marked.

250
00:12:21,135 --> 00:12:22,568
You hear me?

251
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:24,525
- American? That'll
take some time to...

252
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:25,959
And I want two pistols,

253
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,003
and a getaway car and
bulletproof vests,

254
00:12:28,004 --> 00:12:30,003
for, for the hostages, too.

255
00:12:30,004 --> 00:12:32,264
That's a little one sided.

256
00:12:32,265 --> 00:12:35,308
And who is this hostage,
just you, cowboy?

257
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:37,785
Me and Gunnar, you get it?

258
00:12:37,786 --> 00:12:40,308
We will let the ladies
go when it's over.

259
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:41,742
When we're free.

260
00:12:41,743 --> 00:12:44,264
I'll talk with the Ministry.

261
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:46,047
Give us a few hours.

262
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:49,396
I thought I was talking to
somebody with some authority?

263
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,048
I thought I was talking
to a bank robber?

264
00:12:59,265 --> 00:13:01,394
Better not see
any cops on this floor.

265
00:13:01,395 --> 00:13:02,785
Huh?

266
00:13:02,786 --> 00:13:03,916
I'm gonna be upstairs.

267
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,482
You alright?

268
00:13:06,612 --> 00:13:08,437
C'mon.

270
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,394
Only if you
have a clear shot, right?

271
00:13:18,395 --> 00:13:19,482
Yes, I understand.

273
00:13:22,743 --> 00:13:24,872
Step back, everybody.

274
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:30,481
How do you know
Gunnar Sorensson?

275
00:13:30,482 --> 00:13:32,916
Oh, everybody
knows Gunnar Sorensson.

He's the greatest bank
robber in the whole world.

Didn't he kill someone?

Listen, it's a couple
hour drive from Kalmar,

hmm?

280
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:50,698
I brought us a cribbage
board, some cards.

281
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:52,568
I don't have any red pegs,

282
00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:55,524
but I have some matchsticks
that we can use.

283
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:57,264
Alright? Do you play cribbage?

284
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,568
I have to pee.

285
00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:02,568
I don't wanna die.

286
00:14:06,482 --> 00:14:08,264
Let me take her to a restroom.

287
00:14:09,656 --> 00:14:10,743
Do I look like an idiot?

288
00:14:12,177 --> 00:14:13,569

- Keep moving.
- Give a statement!

330
00:18:08,785 --> 00:18:10,523
Oh, yeah.

331
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:11,870
I like that movie.

332
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:12,870
Yeah.

333
00:18:20,785 --> 00:18:22,697
I did it!

334
00:18:22,698 --> 00:18:23,784
Yeah!

335
00:18:23,785 --> 00:18:25,132
You're free, hah!

336
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:27,045
We're set, I've
got a boat for us

337
00:18:27,046 --> 00:18:28,914
...we sail tonight.

338
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:31,132
You crazy bastard, Kreditbank?

339
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:33,741
Yeah, like Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

340
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:35,567
Wait, wait,
wait are you on something?

341
00:18:35,568 --> 00:18:37,393
Yeah, why, you
want some?

342
00:18:37,394 --> 00:18:38,870
We are surrounded by
every cop in the capital.

343
00:18:38,871 --> 00:18:40,219
You should have told
me you were doing this.

344
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,088
Yeah, I want to surprise you.

345
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:43,870
- What'd they offer you?
- Huh, what do you mean?

346
00:18:43,871 --> 00:18:45,175
What do they
want you to kill me?

347
00:18:45,176 --> 00:18:46,567
I'd never do that.

348
00:18:46,568 --> 00:18:48,088
Yeah, I know
you'd never do that,

349
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:49,393
but what'd the offer you?

350
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:50,654
- A little money?
- Nothing.

351
00:18:50,655 --> 00:18:52,045
Nothing, nothing
- No.

352
00:18:52,046 --> 00:18:53,219
- C'mon.
- I'm a mediator.

353
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,480
- Oh, a mediator.
- Yeah.

354
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:58,219
That sounds important.

355
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,306
Hey, meet the girls, huh?

356
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:03,696
Hey, girls, I want you
to meet my best friend,

357
00:19:03,697 --> 00:19:06,567
Gunnar Sorensson.

358
00:19:06,568 --> 00:19:09,957
Bum-Ba-da-bum-bum-Ba.

359
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,349
Oh, sorry, this is Bianca.

360
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,653
Bianca, Gunnar.

361
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:15,175
And um?

362
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:16,175
- Klara.
- Klara.

363
00:19:17,263 --> 00:19:18,262
- Gunnar, Klara.
- Hi.

364
00:19:18,263 --> 00:19:19,827
And...

365
00:19:19,828 --> 00:19:22,480
one government-issue pistol.

366
00:19:22,481 --> 00:19:24,132
Look at all this stuff.

367
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:25,914
Why did you bring all this?

368
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,522
Yeah, well,
in case we get delayed.

369
00:19:27,523 --> 00:19:29,442
You know, who knows what
we're gonna need, right?

370
00:19:31,307 --> 00:19:32,349
It's good, right?

371
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:38,828
What?

372
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:43,001
You didn't disable the cameras?

373
00:19:43,002 --> 00:19:45,219
No, I, I didn't think...

374
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,479
You think I should of?

375
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,306
I just thought,

376
00:19:48,307 --> 00:19:49,827
you know, we're
not gonna be here

377
00:19:49,828 --> 00:19:51,046
very long, you know?

378
00:19:52,654 --> 00:19:54,263
Where is the tape room?

379
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,827
Down that hall.

380
00:19:57,828 --> 00:19:59,046
By the deposit vault.

381
00:20:02,349 --> 00:20:03,870
I'll check it out.

382
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,522
Alright, well... it's,

383
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:09,914
I just don't think it's that
big of deal, you know, I mean.

384
00:20:09,915 --> 00:20:11,522
Where are you going?

385
00:20:11,523 --> 00:20:13,175
No, yeah, right, right.
You stay with the girls.

386
00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:15,435
Yeah, yeah, I know,
of course, of course.

387
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:20,132
I just...

388
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,783
Somebody there?

389
00:21:01,741 --> 00:21:04,045
Hey. Look what I found.

390
00:21:06,088 --> 00:21:07,870
Who's he?

391
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:09,045
He was hiding.

392
00:21:11,654 --> 00:21:12,783
Who are you, huh?

393
00:21:12,784 --> 00:21:13,827
I'm Elov.

394
00:21:13,828 --> 00:21:14,827
You know him?

395
00:21:14,828 --> 00:21:16,261
- No.
- No.

396
00:21:16,262 --> 00:21:17,696
What do you do, huh?

397
00:21:17,697 --> 00:21:19,435
- You a cop?
- No.

398
00:21:19,436 --> 00:21:20,741
I'm not.

399
00:21:22,436 --> 00:21:24,305
I've worked
on a cruise ship.

400
00:21:24,306 --> 00:21:26,914
A cruise ship?
What to America?

401
00:21:26,915 --> 00:21:28,218
- Yes.
- Oh, right on.

402
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:29,219
Sometimes, yes.

403
00:21:30,784 --> 00:21:32,609
What were you doing
in the supply room?

404
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,740
I beg you, please,
just let me go.

405
00:21:34,741 --> 00:21:36,000
- Well he's not a cop.
- No.

406
00:21:36,001 --> 00:21:37,262
I'll tell you that.

407
00:21:38,828 --> 00:21:40,653
I say we let him go.

408
00:21:40,654 --> 00:21:41,784
Uhm.

409
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:45,869
We could use another, um,

410
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,826
another body, ya know?

411
00:21:47,827 --> 00:21:49,392
Kaj Hansson.

412
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:51,261
Escaped from prison
seven months ago,

413
00:21:51,262 --> 00:21:53,261
and now he robs a bank
in order to spring

414
00:21:53,262 --> 00:21:55,348
his old bank robber
pal, Gunnar Sorensson.

415
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:57,566
Chief, a man in the back hall

416
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,131
is demanding to speak with you.

417
00:21:59,132 --> 00:22:00,654
Well, who is it?

418
00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:04,870
Mrs. Lind's husband is here.

419
00:22:07,262 --> 00:22:09,044
Come over, and let,

420
00:22:09,045 --> 00:22:11,696
let you talk to him.

421
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:13,653
Don't let them
boss you around.

422
00:22:13,654 --> 00:22:17,131
Yeah, whoa, whoa,
whoa! What do we get, huh?

423
00:22:17,132 --> 00:22:18,653
Yeah, we're hungry!

424
00:22:18,654 --> 00:22:20,174
Yeah, we could
starve to death in here

425
00:22:20,175 --> 00:22:21,435
Waitin' for this Mustang!

426
00:22:21,436 --> 00:22:23,435
It's coming, and

427
00:22:23,436 --> 00:22:24,956
and we will bring you food.

428
00:22:24,957 --> 00:22:26,522
And beer.

429
00:22:26,523 --> 00:22:29,956
Yeah, food, beer,
cigarettes, Marlboro Reds.

430
00:22:29,957 --> 00:22:31,869
Yeah, yeah, slowly.

431
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,652
Bianca, are you okay?

432
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:35,567
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

433
00:22:36,696 --> 00:22:38,348
What are you doing here?

434
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:39,826
Why are you not with the kids?

435
00:22:39,827 --> 00:22:40,869
Well, I had to come.

436
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,782
- I, I mean.
- Go home.

437
00:22:42,783 --> 00:22:44,175
And make them dinner.

438
00:22:45,393 --> 00:22:47,305
And don't tell them about

439
00:22:47,306 --> 00:22:48,652
this.

440
00:22:48,653 --> 00:22:50,044
Okay, I won't.

441
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:51,565
When will you be home?

442
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:53,695
She'll be home
tonight if, ah, beanpole

443
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,695
over here can keep
his promises, 'Kay?

444
00:22:55,696 --> 00:22:56,783
- Yeah, listen.
- Whoa.

445
00:22:59,001 --> 00:23:00,392
Let me take her spot.

446
00:23:00,393 --> 00:23:01,652
Ooh.

447
00:23:01,653 --> 00:23:03,305
Woohoohoohooooh.

448
00:23:03,306 --> 00:23:05,739
Sounding off like he's got
a pair, huh?

449
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,044
I like that, I like that.

450
00:23:08,045 --> 00:23:09,565
But no.

451
00:23:09,566 --> 00:23:11,305
How about that, Gunnar?

452
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,521
Why don't you come over
here and help us out?

453
00:23:12,522 --> 00:23:13,521
You heard him.

454
00:23:14,957 --> 00:23:15,957
He says no.

455
00:23:17,349 --> 00:23:18,348
I said no.

456
00:23:18,349 --> 00:23:20,000
Okay?

457
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:21,695
In case you haven't
noticed, your wife's a fox.

458
00:23:21,696 --> 00:23:24,305
- Hey.
- And you're not, huh? C'mon.

459
00:23:24,306 --> 00:23:25,739
No, wait, wait, please.

460
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,565
It won't be long, okay.

461
00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:28,956
Write this down.

462
00:23:28,957 --> 00:23:30,087
Please, write it down.

463
00:23:30,088 --> 00:23:31,521
Okay, give me a pen, c'mon.

464
00:23:31,522 --> 00:23:34,000
I don't have one.
Jakobsson.

465
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:35,391
Okay, I got it.

466
00:23:35,392 --> 00:23:36,956
You take the herring
out of the fridge.

467
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,521
I already deboned it,

468
00:23:38,522 --> 00:23:39,913
so you don't have
to worry about bones

469
00:23:39,914 --> 00:23:41,131
for Martin and
Mia when they eat.

470
00:23:41,132 --> 00:23:42,608
Why are you saying this?

471
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:44,131
Because the fish, so
you can cook the fish.

472
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,434
Okay, write this down.

473
00:23:45,435 --> 00:23:48,000
You take a, a
tablespoon of flour

474
00:23:48,001 --> 00:23:49,608
onto a plate,

475
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:51,044
and add some salt and pepper,

476
00:23:51,045 --> 00:23:52,521
and then you put the fish in.

477
00:23:52,522 --> 00:23:53,956
In the plate?

478
00:23:53,957 --> 00:23:55,131
On the plate, and
then you turn it over.

479
00:23:55,132 --> 00:23:56,088
- Okay.
- And you put

480
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:57,521
a spoon on butter into the pan,

481
00:23:57,522 --> 00:23:59,087
and heat it up
until it gets brown.

482
00:23:59,088 --> 00:24:00,782
When the butter gets brown?

483
00:24:00,783 --> 00:24:01,956
The butter gets brown.

484
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:04,000
And then you put the fish in,

485
00:24:04,001 --> 00:24:06,131
and you fry it for, um,

486
00:24:06,132 --> 00:24:07,869
four or five minutes. Not more.

487
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:10,739
On each side because Mia
doesn't like when it's burned.

488
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,391
- I know.
- 'Cause she won't eat it.

489
00:24:12,392 --> 00:24:13,956
So, so that's important.

490
00:24:13,957 --> 00:24:15,739
Four or five minutes.

491
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,695
And then, ah, the potatoes
I boiled last night.

492
00:24:17,696 --> 00:24:19,000
So you don't need to do
anything, you just take

493
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:20,783
Bianca, Bianca,
I don't know, I, I.

494
00:24:22,305 --> 00:24:23,566
I love you.

495
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,130
I love you, too.

496
00:24:27,131 --> 00:24:32,086
And the lingonberries jam is
in the jar your mom gave us.

497
00:24:32,087 --> 00:24:33,608
The green jar.

498
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:36,652
It's in the side, in
the door of the fridge.

499
00:24:36,653 --> 00:24:39,695
Um, if I die, you can,
you can live on fish.

500
00:24:39,696 --> 00:24:40,999
You won't die.

501
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,695
She won't die!

502
00:24:42,696 --> 00:24:43,739
- She won't right?
- Please don't tell them.

503
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,260
Yes, she won't die

504
00:24:45,261 --> 00:24:46,955
as long as he gives me
what I need, alright?

505
00:24:46,956 --> 00:24:49,130
- I need a Mustang!
- Please don't tell them.

506
00:24:49,131 --> 00:24:50,999
Please don't tell Mia.
I need unmarked bills!

507
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,391
I need food, I need cigarettes!

508
00:24:52,392 --> 00:24:53,913
You're not helpin'
me at all, Jack!

509
00:24:53,914 --> 00:24:56,999
It's all on its way, Kaj.

510
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,609
Or, excuse me, would
you prefer Mr. Hansson?

511
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:04,392
We know it's you.

512
00:25:06,783 --> 00:25:08,608
Call me whatever
you want, okay?

513
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:10,478
Hmm, good.

514
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:13,086
And you cannot leave
with these hostages.

515
00:25:13,087 --> 00:25:14,825
Ah, yes,

516
00:25:14,826 --> 00:25:17,955
we will be taking the
hostages out of here.

517
00:25:17,956 --> 00:25:19,955
No, you can't.

518
00:25:19,956 --> 00:25:21,435
It's Prime Minister's orders.

519
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,956
The car's a death
trap without them.

520
00:25:27,218 --> 00:25:28,739
The car is coming.

521
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,479
You're free to go on your own.

522
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:36,043
You might have to
kill one of them

523
00:25:36,044 --> 00:25:37,261
so we can get out of here.

524
00:25:52,782 --> 00:25:55,173
Some people,
quite properly appalled

525
00:25:55,174 --> 00:25:56,999
at the abuses that occurred,

526
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,304
will say that
Watergate demonstrates

527
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:03,304
the bankruptcy of the
American political system.

528
00:26:04,392 --> 00:26:05,912
Excuse me, Olof?

529
00:26:05,913 --> 00:26:07,738
Not now, please.

530
00:26:07,739 --> 00:26:09,173
I just received a call

531
00:26:09,174 --> 00:26:10,651
from Kaj Hansson at Kreditbank.

532
00:26:12,131 --> 00:26:13,956
He says he'll kill
the hostages, sir.

533
00:26:15,695 --> 00:26:17,087
This whole thing is absurd.

534
00:26:18,565 --> 00:26:19,651
Hello?

535
00:26:19,652 --> 00:26:21,651
Hello, Mr. Prime Minister.

536
00:26:21,652 --> 00:26:22,955
Mr. Hansson.

537
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,043
Your Chief of Police

538
00:26:25,044 --> 00:26:26,434
says

539
00:26:26,435 --> 00:26:28,999
that you won't let us
leave with the hostages.

540
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,955
That's quite right.

541
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,347
So then you want
to be responsible

542
00:26:33,348 --> 00:26:35,999
for the deaths of
innocent citizens?

543
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,477
No, of course not.

544
00:26:37,478 --> 00:26:39,781
Well, then,
let us leave with them.

545
00:26:39,782 --> 00:26:41,391
That is simply impossible.

546
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:42,521
Olof,

547
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,868
I am gonna count to 10,

548
00:26:46,869 --> 00:26:51,130
and if you don't agree to let
us leave with the hostages,

549
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:53,086
then I'm going to kill

550
00:26:53,087 --> 00:26:54,433
Klara, yeah.

551
00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:56,694
So, beginning now.

552
00:26:56,695 --> 00:26:58,130
Ten!

553
00:26:58,131 --> 00:26:59,260
Nine!

554
00:26:59,261 --> 00:27:01,738
Eight!
No, no, no!

555
00:27:01,739 --> 00:27:03,173
Stop that!

556
00:27:03,174 --> 00:27:05,564
Do you agree? Seven!

557
00:27:05,565 --> 00:27:06,825
- Stop it.
- Stop it!

558
00:27:06,826 --> 00:27:08,260
- Sorry.
- Let go of me!

559
00:27:08,261 --> 00:27:09,607
Don't touch me again!

560
00:27:09,608 --> 00:27:10,999
Six! Five!

561
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,607
- Four!
- Now you listen to me,

562
00:27:12,608 --> 00:27:13,694
- Mr. Hansson.
- Please stop you don't

563
00:27:13,695 --> 00:27:14,955
- wanna do this.
- Hey!

564
00:27:14,956 --> 00:27:16,477
Back off! Alright?

565
00:27:16,478 --> 00:27:18,217
Do you agree? Three!

566
00:27:18,218 --> 00:27:19,651
You stop that! Now!

567
00:27:19,652 --> 00:27:20,651
- Two, one, do you agree?
- No!

568
00:27:20,652 --> 00:27:21,694
Listen to me.

569
00:27:21,695 --> 00:27:23,520
Mr. Hansson!

570
00:27:23,521 --> 00:27:25,260
No!

571
00:27:28,478 --> 00:27:31,303
You have 'til tomorrow
to change you mind

572
00:27:31,304 --> 00:27:32,434
or one of them dies.

573
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:35,825
Fuuuuuck!

574
00:27:35,826 --> 00:27:36,999
Fuck!

575
00:27:46,478 --> 00:27:48,043
You,

576
00:27:48,044 --> 00:27:49,173
you coward.

577
00:27:50,695 --> 00:27:52,477
Ah!

578
00:27:52,478 --> 00:27:54,216
You shut your mouth.

579
00:28:05,565 --> 00:28:07,043
I thought they'd cooperate.

580
00:28:08,739 --> 00:28:10,564
You know, I thought
they'd cooperate.

581
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:12,738
I didn't think the
Prime Minister of Sweden

582
00:28:12,739 --> 00:28:14,433
doesn't give a shit
if they live or die.

583
00:28:14,434 --> 00:28:15,913
I mean, what's
that say about us?

584
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,129
You know
what they told me?

585
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:25,172
That you kill a hostage, they
get you a plane out of here.

586
00:28:25,173 --> 00:28:26,739
How crazy is that, man?

587
00:28:31,391 --> 00:28:33,520
- No, no, no pills, no.
- No, I got to.

588
00:28:33,521 --> 00:28:34,867
- No, you need the - sleep.
- Yeah, I can't, I can't

589
00:28:34,868 --> 00:28:36,433
I can't go to sleep.
This is wide open.

590
00:28:36,434 --> 00:28:38,172
I don't trust the cops.
We can't sleep.

591
00:28:38,173 --> 00:28:40,259
There's a vault
in the back there.

592
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,129
We can sleep in there.

593
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,129
I can't take this anymore.

594
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,520
Don't worry.

595
00:28:44,521 --> 00:28:45,781
- I want go home.
- It's okay.

596
00:28:45,782 --> 00:28:47,520
It's gonna be okay.

597
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:48,695
Bianca?

598
00:28:50,608 --> 00:28:52,608
You got a key to the vault?

599
00:29:11,608 --> 00:29:13,912
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

600
00:29:15,825 --> 00:29:18,477
Get in, in, in.

601
00:29:18,478 --> 00:29:20,042
Gunnar Sorensson is here

602
00:29:20,043 --> 00:29:22,477
to help us broker a
peaceful resolution.

603
00:29:22,478 --> 00:29:23,780
And the hostages?

604
00:29:23,781 --> 00:29:25,172
Can you confirm
their identities?

605
00:29:25,173 --> 00:29:27,129
Yes, Elov Erikkson,

606
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:30,303
Bianca Lind and Klara Mardh.

607
00:29:30,304 --> 00:29:31,998
Has Mr. Hansson
harmed any of them?

608
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:34,520
Actually,
we spoke half an hour ago

609
00:29:34,521 --> 00:29:36,433
with a gentleman
hiding out in Hawaii

610
00:29:36,434 --> 00:29:39,129
who claims to be the
real Kaj Hansson.

611
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,259
And what did he say?

612
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,650
He said he's
gonna sue all of us

613
00:29:42,651 --> 00:29:44,216
for spreading libelous rumors.

614
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:46,390
Said he would never
take hostages.

615
00:29:46,391 --> 00:29:49,780
So if the robber's not
Kaj Hansson, who is it?

616
00:29:49,781 --> 00:29:51,650
Well, we are working on that.

617
00:29:51,651 --> 00:29:53,303
And the girls,
have, have they been harmed?

618
00:29:53,304 --> 00:29:54,650
Yes,

619
00:29:54,651 --> 00:29:55,738
and we fear

620
00:29:56,825 --> 00:29:58,303
he may rape them.

621
00:29:58,304 --> 00:30:01,173
Bullshit! Turn
that off. Goddamn!

622
00:30:04,564 --> 00:30:06,259
Why would they say that?

623
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,694
Cops lie to get
what they want.

624
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:10,694
Do I look like a rapist?

625
00:30:14,477 --> 00:30:15,693
Jeez, if I knew
we were going to be

626
00:30:15,694 --> 00:30:17,042
spending all night in here,

627
00:30:17,043 --> 00:30:18,346
I would have brought
your 12-string.

628
00:30:18,347 --> 00:30:20,042
This guy can play, okay?

629
00:30:20,043 --> 00:30:23,216
In Kalmar, Gunnar played
beautifully, all night long.

630
00:30:23,217 --> 00:30:26,085
Remember, ah, Helsingborg?

631
00:30:26,086 --> 00:30:27,867
At the fair.

632
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,780
- We used to sing.
- Hmm.

633
00:30:29,781 --> 00:30:32,129
No, thank you.

634
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,172
We used to knock this
Dylan song out of the park.

635
00:30:34,173 --> 00:30:35,998
Remember that?

636
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:37,519
- Tomorrow is a long time.

667
00:33:14,563 --> 00:33:16,128
I'm sorry.

668
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:18,345
I'm sorry, I just, I
wanted to listen to music

669
00:33:18,346 --> 00:33:20,563
I, I didn't know until I,

670
00:33:22,346 --> 00:33:25,171
I like music, I like when
you were singing before.

671
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:27,780
I had one of them when I was 19.

672
00:33:35,129 --> 00:33:37,303
So, um, so you're
from Helsinborg?

673
00:33:39,042 --> 00:33:40,042
Born there.

674
00:33:41,346 --> 00:33:42,736
Grew up in the states.

675
00:33:42,737 --> 00:33:45,867
- Yeah, yeah, the accent, I.
- Mmhmm.

676
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,345
I remember, I ah,

677
00:33:55,042 --> 00:33:56,737
I saw a photo in Helsinborg

678
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:00,563
paper maybe, five,
six years ago.

679
00:34:02,737 --> 00:34:03,954
That was you, right?

680
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:08,216
You broke into

681
00:34:09,345 --> 00:34:10,867
elderly couple's house.

682
00:34:12,476 --> 00:34:15,084
And the old man's heart
started acting up.

683
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:17,432
His wife asked you to
get his heart medicine,

684
00:34:19,129 --> 00:34:20,998
and you did and
you saved his life.

685
00:34:22,345 --> 00:34:24,389
Wasn't me.

686
00:34:36,476 --> 00:34:39,041
When we get out of here,

687
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:42,475
they're gonna put a transmitter
under the car, right?

688
00:34:42,476 --> 00:34:44,518
They're gonna track us.

689
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:47,605
But if Gunnar and I could
slip out of the car,

690
00:34:47,606 --> 00:34:50,823
near the cove, and somebody
else drove it up the E4.

691
00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:52,128
Just for a couple hours.

692
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:54,737
That'd give us enough time to

693
00:34:55,998 --> 00:34:57,606
sail across the Baltic.

694
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,518
You think you could
do that for me?

695
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:03,954
- What, me?
- Yeah.

696
00:35:07,737 --> 00:35:09,518
You don't know how to drive?

697
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:10,996
Yes, yes, I do.

698
00:35:10,997 --> 00:35:12,215
Then you could do it.

699
00:35:14,128 --> 00:35:16,562
No.

700
00:35:16,563 --> 00:35:18,736
Where are you going, what's...?

701
00:35:18,737 --> 00:35:20,692
I'm gonna go to France.

702
00:35:20,693 --> 00:35:21,997
And take the money.

703
00:35:23,084 --> 00:35:25,431
Gonna get a plastic surgeon.

704
00:35:25,432 --> 00:35:26,910
Start over, you know?

705
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,344
I remember, um,

706
00:35:35,345 --> 00:35:38,171
the Helsinborg's
robber had a, a wife.

707
00:35:41,084 --> 00:35:42,302
And a kid.

708
00:35:45,345 --> 00:35:47,605
It was an ex-wife.

709
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:48,606
And a son.

710
00:35:51,997 --> 00:35:54,041
What was the name of
the Helsinborg robber?

711
00:35:55,606 --> 00:35:59,431
That little priss's
name was Lars, okay?

712
00:35:59,432 --> 00:36:01,083
But that's not me.

713
00:36:01,084 --> 00:36:02,519
That's not who I am.

714
00:36:06,389 --> 00:36:08,779
I have a daughter.
And a son.

715
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:12,345
I'd like to see
them again, Lars.

716
00:36:46,779 --> 00:36:48,996
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

717
00:36:48,997 --> 00:36:50,431
Were you sleeping?

718
00:36:50,432 --> 00:36:52,388
No, no, of course not.

719
00:36:52,389 --> 00:36:53,909
Where are you?

720
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,301
Have you been freed?

721
00:36:55,302 --> 00:36:57,301
No, I'm, I'm
still at the bank.

722
00:36:57,302 --> 00:36:58,952
Wha, what, what
does that mean?

723
00:36:58,953 --> 00:37:00,170
I, I don't have much time.

724
00:37:00,171 --> 00:37:01,302
I just, um...

725
00:37:03,779 --> 00:37:05,952
I, I miss Mia and
Martin so much.

726
00:37:05,953 --> 00:37:09,257
I just wanna hear
their voices, I...

727
00:37:09,258 --> 00:37:12,127
I can't really think
about anything else.

728
00:37:12,128 --> 00:37:13,387
What about me?

729
00:37:13,388 --> 00:37:14,474
Tcha.

730
00:37:14,475 --> 00:37:15,997
I'm kidding.

731
00:37:17,475 --> 00:37:19,214
I just got Mia down.

732
00:37:19,215 --> 00:37:21,474
Can you, can you wake her up?

733
00:37:21,475 --> 00:37:23,127
She really needs
to sleep, Bianca.

734
00:37:23,128 --> 00:37:24,692
I know, but...

735
00:37:26,823 --> 00:37:28,128
You didn't tell her, did you?

736
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,735
You did.

737
00:37:31,736 --> 00:37:32,909
It's all over the news.

738
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,865
She would have found out.

739
00:37:34,866 --> 00:37:36,170
Christopher, I told
you, I, I asked you not to.

740
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:37,691
I'm not as strong as you.

741
00:37:37,692 --> 00:37:39,778
I'm, can you please just worry

742
00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:41,430
about getting
yourself out of there.

743
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:42,430
Of course, yes.

744
00:37:42,431 --> 00:37:44,213
I'll, I'll try harder tomorrow.

745
00:37:44,214 --> 00:37:46,431
I didn't mean it like that, I'm...

746
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,127
Is he listening?

747
00:37:51,128 --> 00:37:52,649
No.

748
00:37:53,736 --> 00:37:54,779
No, he's not listening.

749
00:37:56,605 --> 00:37:58,040
He's,

750
00:37:58,041 --> 00:37:59,343
he let me call.

751
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:00,562
He didn't have to.

752
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:03,865
He's not all bad.

753
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:05,256
What are you saying?

754
00:38:05,257 --> 00:38:07,517
Uh, uh, I just mean,
nobody's all bad.

755
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,866
No, but that man is an animal.

756
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:13,822
Bianca?

757
00:38:13,823 --> 00:38:14,953
Yes?

758
00:38:16,344 --> 00:38:19,474
How, um, how did
the fish turn out?

759
00:38:19,475 --> 00:38:21,909
I took a
meatloaf out of the freezer.

760
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,040
It was easier.

761
00:38:24,475 --> 00:38:25,562
Right.

762
00:38:26,562 --> 00:38:28,343
Well, I have to, um...

763
00:38:28,344 --> 00:38:29,343
Be careful.

764
00:38:29,344 --> 00:38:30,343
Yeah, good night.

765
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,127
How was the fish?

766
00:38:36,649 --> 00:38:37,909
They had meatloaf.

767
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,908
Bianca, Bianca.

768
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:01,256
What's going on?

769
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:02,256
Huh?

770
00:39:03,649 --> 00:39:04,864
What are you two,

771
00:39:04,865 --> 00:39:06,126
what are you two up to, huh?

772
00:39:06,127 --> 00:39:07,170
It's my period.

773
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,213
What's going on?

774
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:11,343
Uh.

775
00:39:11,344 --> 00:39:12,648
I need tampons.

776
00:39:12,649 --> 00:39:13,927
She, she got her period.

777
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,343
She need tampons.

778
00:39:16,344 --> 00:39:17,951
What?

779
00:39:17,952 --> 00:39:20,343
Where are we supposed
to get tampons?

780
00:39:20,344 --> 00:39:23,343
Wha... don't you have any?

781
00:39:23,344 --> 00:39:24,734
It's way too early.

782
00:39:24,735 --> 00:39:26,474
It's not supposed to come yet.

783
00:39:26,475 --> 00:39:28,649
It's the trauma.
Her body is stressed.

784
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:30,952
Huh.

785
00:39:32,562 --> 00:39:33,822
Okay, yeah, I see, okay.

786
00:39:35,257 --> 00:39:36,561
Ask the cops.
Yeah, I'll get the,

787
00:39:36,562 --> 00:39:37,908
I'll, I'll get the cops.

788
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:39,127
Thank you.

789
00:39:41,301 --> 00:39:42,430
Hey!

790
00:39:42,431 --> 00:39:44,430
Emergency!

791
00:39:44,431 --> 00:39:46,604
Emergency! It's Klara!

792
00:39:46,605 --> 00:39:48,474
- Shit!
- Easy, easy. Easy.

793
00:39:48,475 --> 00:39:49,864
What happened?

794
00:39:49,865 --> 00:39:52,169
It's Klara, she's bleeding man.

795
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,126
You know, we know
you're not Kaj.

796
00:39:54,127 --> 00:39:56,169
Who are you?

797
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,734
Don't worry about that
right now, okay, Kojak?

798
00:39:58,735 --> 00:40:00,387
Alright, we got bigger problems.

799
00:40:00,388 --> 00:40:01,821
Alright, she's, she's

800
00:40:01,822 --> 00:40:03,430
What did you do to her?

801
00:40:03,431 --> 00:40:04,995
I didn't do anything,
man, it's her time.

802
00:40:04,996 --> 00:40:07,387
It's, it's, you know, c'mon.

803
00:40:07,388 --> 00:40:08,777
She, she, I need some,

804
00:40:08,778 --> 00:40:10,603
tampons, okay?

805
00:40:10,604 --> 00:40:13,603
Look, we need to check the
health of all of the hostages.

806
00:40:13,604 --> 00:40:15,951
You don't need anything, okay?

807
00:40:15,952 --> 00:40:18,995
Except to get Klara
some tampons, okay?

808
00:40:18,996 --> 00:40:21,821
And if you get them, I will
bring everybody out here,

809
00:40:21,822 --> 00:40:23,430
and you can give 'em a
clean bill of health.

810
00:40:23,431 --> 00:40:24,777
Alright?

811
00:40:24,778 --> 00:40:26,213
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

812
00:40:26,214 --> 00:40:27,300
Thank you.

813
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,603
We were
supposed to be covering

814
00:40:33,604 --> 00:40:35,039
the Crayfish Festival today,

815
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,647
but as you can see,

816
00:40:36,648 --> 00:40:38,821
media has arrived
here and in the square

817
00:40:38,822 --> 00:40:40,256
from all over Europe.

818
00:40:40,257 --> 00:40:41,429
The police are desperate here

819
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,082
in Central Stockholm.

820
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:44,951
Authorities have
received over 200 calls

821
00:40:44,952 --> 00:40:47,082
from citizens
offering suggestions

822
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:48,648
to end this crisis.

823
00:40:58,648 --> 00:41:01,342
Mrs. Lind, ah,
how are you feeling?

824
00:41:01,343 --> 00:41:03,126
Not so good.

825
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,429
I like to go home.

826
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,603
Don't worry, sweetheart.

827
00:41:06,604 --> 00:41:08,213
We're taking care of everything.

828
00:41:08,214 --> 00:41:09,821
Is that so?

829
00:41:09,822 --> 00:41:11,169
You think we should trust
you and your partner?

830
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:13,039
My dear, dear girl.

831
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,864
You are not thinking straight.

832
00:41:14,865 --> 00:41:17,299
Hey, don't patronize her.
Okay, we've had enough of that.

833
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,516
All of us.

834
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,777
Don't listen to him.

835
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:21,908
You see, everybody's fine.

836
00:41:21,909 --> 00:41:24,342
Alright, we just
need the tampons.

837
00:41:24,343 --> 00:41:26,560
We need the bag that
hopefully has the vests in it,

838
00:41:26,561 --> 00:41:28,168
and you have to convince
the Prime Minister

839
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:30,648
to let us leave today
or somebody dies.

840
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,909
I'm trying.

841
00:41:33,822 --> 00:41:35,473
Okay, c'mon.

842
00:41:35,474 --> 00:41:37,429
Go get us some breakfast
now, it's taken so long.

843
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:38,951
Alright?

844
00:41:38,952 --> 00:41:41,342
Our deal is expiring soon.

845
00:41:41,343 --> 00:41:42,735
You shut up about the deal.

846
00:41:48,082 --> 00:41:50,995
Do you see how cozy they are?

847
00:41:50,996 --> 00:41:52,517
The way they speak to us.

848
00:41:54,604 --> 00:41:55,735
Yeah.

849
00:42:00,909 --> 00:42:01,908
Pick it up.

850
00:42:03,256 --> 00:42:05,516
- Me?
- Yeah. Pick it up.

851
00:42:07,604 --> 00:42:09,038
Hello?

852
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:11,255
I am Vincent Oberg with

853
00:42:11,256 --> 00:42:13,038
the Swedish Television
outside the Kreditbank.

854
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:14,038
Who's this?

855
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:15,516
Uh, this is Bianca Lind.

856
00:42:15,517 --> 00:42:17,429
- Who is it?
- It's a journalist.

857
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:19,125
Mrs. Lind, Vincent
Oberg, Swedish Television.

858
00:42:19,126 --> 00:42:20,821
Yeah, you just said that.

859
00:42:20,822 --> 00:42:22,821
All of Sweden
would like to know,

860
00:42:22,822 --> 00:42:25,100
what is it like being stuck
in there with those criminals?

861
00:42:25,951 --> 00:42:27,255
It's not too bad.

862
00:42:27,256 --> 00:42:28,517
We want to leave with them.

863
00:42:29,735 --> 00:42:30,863
With the robbers?

864
00:42:30,864 --> 00:42:32,777
That's correct.

865
00:42:32,778 --> 00:42:35,256
But why,
I, I don't understand?

866
00:42:36,343 --> 00:42:37,950
'Cause we want to live.

867
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,734
Sure, but,
but you trust them?

868
00:42:39,735 --> 00:42:41,950
More than
we trust our police.

869
00:42:41,951 --> 00:42:44,473
Ah, why
haven't you left then?

870
00:42:44,474 --> 00:42:46,386
Because our own Prime Minister

871
00:42:46,387 --> 00:42:47,950
refuses to let us go.

872
00:42:47,951 --> 00:42:50,299
He doesn't seem to care.

873
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,212
You think this is political?

874
00:42:52,213 --> 00:42:54,168
Could you connect me
to Vincent Oberg, thank you.

875
00:42:54,169 --> 00:42:55,690
Everything is political.

876
00:42:55,691 --> 00:42:56,690
But surely the Prime Minister

877
00:42:56,691 --> 00:42:57,950
cares about your life.

878
00:42:57,951 --> 00:42:59,429
The Prime Minister's
on line two.

879
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:01,081
I'll patch him into
the switchboard.

880
00:43:01,082 --> 00:43:02,299
Hang up, that's it.

881
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,863
That's all I have to say.

882
00:43:03,864 --> 00:43:06,038
Hold on, Miss Lind?
Hold on.

883
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:07,777
I have the Prime
Minister on the line.

884
00:43:09,256 --> 00:43:11,212
Sir, you're live with Miss Lind.

885
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,560
You hear this?

886
00:43:12,561 --> 00:43:13,950
- Hello?
- Hello?

887
00:43:13,951 --> 00:43:16,429
Mrs. Lind,
I've been listening.

888
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,950
It's not that simple.

889
00:43:17,951 --> 00:43:20,602
Mr. Prime Minister, it is.

890
00:43:20,603 --> 00:43:22,387
If you let us go, we might live.

891
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,950
If the police don't interfere,

892
00:43:25,951 --> 00:43:28,430
nobody will get hurt
and we will survive.

893
00:43:29,995 --> 00:43:31,820
You can save our lives.

894
00:43:31,821 --> 00:43:33,646
And the best way to do that,

895
00:43:33,647 --> 00:43:35,212
is not to let 'em out
on the roads with you.

896
00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:37,299
But we are willing
to take that risk.

897
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,473
I wish that would
make a difference,

898
00:43:39,474 --> 00:43:41,950
but as Prime Minister,
I'm responsible

899
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,602
for all the Swedish people.

900
00:43:43,603 --> 00:43:45,515
Exactly.
But all the Swedish people

901
00:43:45,516 --> 00:43:48,255
are not in here, we are
trapped in here. We.

902
00:43:48,256 --> 00:43:49,907
And,

903
00:43:49,908 --> 00:43:51,299
and if the police comes in,

904
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,428
and they start shooting,
he will shoot back,

905
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:55,299
and then nobody will survive.

906
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,168
We live in
an orderly society.

907
00:43:57,169 --> 00:43:59,299
We should not be able
to violent methods

908
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,559
to do such things.

909
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,255
He's not violent.

910
00:44:02,256 --> 00:44:04,602
And this is not the time
to talk about this society.

911
00:44:04,603 --> 00:44:05,690
I am violent, hey?

912
00:44:07,386 --> 00:44:09,168
Did you hear what
I said last night?

913
00:44:09,169 --> 00:44:10,646
- Now you listen to me.
- Okay,

914
00:44:10,647 --> 00:44:13,212
If I'm not allowed to
leave here right now,

915
00:44:13,213 --> 00:44:15,950
one of these hostages
is going to die.

916
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:17,733
Please, stop it.
Alright, and if it's Mrs. Lind,

917
00:44:17,734 --> 00:44:19,472
I hope you have the guts

918
00:44:19,473 --> 00:44:21,298
to walk over to her house,

919
00:44:21,299 --> 00:44:23,950
and look her small son
and her small daughter

920
00:44:23,951 --> 00:44:26,733
in the eyes and say that
you did the right thing.

921
00:44:26,734 --> 00:44:28,515
I got an idea, come here, mmhmm.

922
00:44:28,516 --> 00:44:29,907
- What?
- I've got an idea.

923
00:44:29,908 --> 00:44:30,994
Give me your pistol,
I need the pistol.

924
00:44:30,995 --> 00:44:32,472
Why?

925
00:44:32,473 --> 00:44:33,733
Give it me, here, hey,
let her go, alright?

926
00:44:33,734 --> 00:44:35,125
Go.

927
00:44:35,126 --> 00:44:36,428
Where are you taking her, man?

928
00:44:36,429 --> 00:44:37,603
Where are you going?

929
00:44:39,342 --> 00:44:40,864
Okay, okay.

930
00:44:43,516 --> 00:44:45,038
You wanna see your
kids again, right?

931
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:46,038
Yes, of course.

932
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:47,038
Right, okay.

933
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:48,733
I got to kill someone, right?

934
00:44:48,734 --> 00:44:50,776
I mean, I've got to and I,
I think it should be you.

935
00:44:50,777 --> 00:44:52,559
What?
You know, I,

936
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,341
they will never let any
of us out of here alive

937
00:44:55,342 --> 00:44:58,081
if they don't believe
that I killed somebody.

938
00:44:58,082 --> 00:44:59,385
Okay?

939
00:44:59,386 --> 00:45:00,515
So,

940
00:45:00,516 --> 00:45:02,038
think?

941
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:04,038
So you wanna,
you wanna shoot me?

942
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:07,341
Yeah, I, I wanna
put this vest on you.

943
00:45:07,342 --> 00:45:08,994
Okay, you understand?

944
00:45:08,995 --> 00:45:12,298
I'm gonna go out there
by the stairs with you.

945
00:45:12,299 --> 00:45:14,689
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
pretend to negotiate.

946
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:17,646
We'll have a given signal, okay?

947
00:45:17,647 --> 00:45:20,211
You try to run, I shoot,

948
00:45:20,212 --> 00:45:23,167
up close at an angle, alright?

949
00:45:23,168 --> 00:45:24,168
It'll hurt.

950
00:45:25,081 --> 00:45:26,255
It'll hurt a lot,

951
00:45:27,212 --> 00:45:28,516
but you won't die.

952
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:33,299
Have you done this before?

953
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,037
Gunnar has.

954
00:45:38,038 --> 00:45:39,864
He did it a few years ago.

955
00:45:42,821 --> 00:45:44,428
Now listen, if
you're too scared,

956
00:45:44,429 --> 00:45:46,341
I'm just gonna make Elov do it.

957
00:45:46,342 --> 00:45:48,515
I am not too scared.

958
00:45:48,516 --> 00:45:51,646
It's just, you are so much
more valuable than he is.

959
00:45:51,647 --> 00:45:54,949
You're a woman, you're a mother.

960
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:57,341
You're extremely valuable.

961
00:45:57,342 --> 00:45:59,080
Alright, the only
part I don't like,

962
00:45:59,081 --> 00:46:01,341
is then we're gonna have to
leave without you, alright?

963
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:04,254
I'll take Klara, I'll take Elov.

964
00:46:04,255 --> 00:46:05,862
We'll get in the car, we'll go.

965
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:08,646
The cops will come
in, they'll find you,

966
00:46:08,647 --> 00:46:12,081
and they'll just take you
straight home to your children.

967
00:46:16,516 --> 00:46:17,515
So,

968
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:22,080
you and the others will survive,

969
00:46:22,081 --> 00:46:23,560
and I can go home?

970
00:46:34,733 --> 00:46:36,820
Do you belong to
the Swedish Church?

971
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,688
Yeah.

972
00:46:39,689 --> 00:46:40,689
I do.

973
00:46:42,473 --> 00:46:45,472
Dear God who holds
his children dear.

974
00:46:45,473 --> 00:46:47,341
Look to me, as little as I am.

975
00:46:47,342 --> 00:46:49,688
My fate is in your hands.

976
00:47:08,473 --> 00:47:09,689
- Bianca.
- Yes?

977
00:47:10,863 --> 00:47:12,211
Bianca, that'll be our signal.

978
00:47:12,212 --> 00:47:13,386
I'll say your name.

979
00:47:14,255 --> 00:47:15,341
And then

980
00:47:15,342 --> 00:47:17,124
you'll run,

981
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,299
and I'll fire.

982
00:47:19,386 --> 00:47:20,385
Okay?

983
00:47:23,472 --> 00:47:24,906
Hey!

984
00:47:24,907 --> 00:47:25,907
Pigs!

985
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:28,038
C'mon out!

986
00:47:30,342 --> 00:47:31,341
Alright, alright.

987
00:47:31,342 --> 00:47:32,775
Listen to me.

988
00:47:32,776 --> 00:47:33,906
I'm done.

989
00:47:33,907 --> 00:47:35,471
Okay, I'm done.

990
00:47:35,472 --> 00:47:37,601
One of two things is
gonna happen right now.

991
00:47:37,602 --> 00:47:41,167
You're gonna get me my
car and my unmarked bills,

992
00:47:41,168 --> 00:47:42,819
and I'm gonna drive outta here,

993
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,254
or I am gonna kill this woman.

994
00:47:45,255 --> 00:47:46,645
- You understand?
- Oh, relax,

995
00:47:46,646 --> 00:47:48,340
you're not going
to shoot anyone.

996
00:47:48,341 --> 00:47:49,775
Oh, really?

997
00:47:49,776 --> 00:47:51,645
We know who you are.

998
00:47:51,646 --> 00:47:52,993
Now.

999
00:47:52,994 --> 00:47:56,080
You are the Helsignborg robber,

1000
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,385
Lars Nystrom.

1001
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:00,688
Ah, you're a big softie.

1002
00:48:00,689 --> 00:48:02,907
Maybe even a bit of a queer.

1003
00:48:04,038 --> 00:48:06,124
I'm not queer, asshole!

1004
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:07,645
It makes sense with the,

1005
00:48:07,646 --> 00:48:09,645
- the long hair.
- Shut up! Shut up!

1006
00:48:09,646 --> 00:48:11,732
- Yeah, Bianca can feel it.
- Shut up, no!

1007
00:48:11,733 --> 00:48:13,471
- Bianca, look at me.
- You don't talk to Bianca!

1008
00:48:13,472 --> 00:48:14,428
- I talk to Bianca!
- Bianca, look over here.

1009
00:48:14,429 --> 00:48:15,601
No! No!

1010
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:17,340
Ah!

1011
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:20,688
Oh.

1012
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:21,732
Shit!

1013
00:48:23,863 --> 00:48:25,558
- What's going on?
- Shut up.

1014
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:26,645
Lars?

1015
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:39,775
Oh, Oooooh!

1016
00:48:39,776 --> 00:48:41,514
Fuck! Oh!

1017
00:48:41,515 --> 00:48:42,732
Shit.

1018
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,688
Vinter, how could I
be so bloody wrong?

1019
00:49:03,689 --> 00:49:04,948
Gunnar!

1020
00:49:04,949 --> 00:49:06,689
- Sit, sit.
- Gunnar!

1021
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:10,297
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.

1022
00:49:10,298 --> 00:49:11,601
Oh, shit.

1023
00:49:11,602 --> 00:49:13,080
- What happened?
- Oh, shit.

1024
00:49:14,124 --> 00:49:15,124
Huh?

1025
00:49:16,472 --> 00:49:17,948
What happened, man?

1026
00:49:17,949 --> 00:49:19,601
She tried to escape, okay?

1027
00:49:19,602 --> 00:49:21,123
She tried to escape and I...

1028
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,558
I shot her, I, I, I...

1029
00:49:23,559 --> 00:49:24,688
You shot her?

1030
00:49:24,689 --> 00:49:26,602
Accidentally, I, I...

1031
00:49:27,428 --> 00:49:28,948
You're insane.

1032
00:49:28,949 --> 00:49:30,427
You come in here,

1033
00:49:30,428 --> 00:49:31,905
and you, you killed
- GUNNAR: Shut up!

1034
00:49:31,906 --> 00:49:33,861
- An unarmed woman!
- Get back, back!

1035
00:49:33,862 --> 00:49:35,558
Sit down!

1036
00:49:37,949 --> 00:49:39,515
Oh, fuck.

1037
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:12,297
Ten minutes ago,
we heard more gunfire

1038
00:50:12,298 --> 00:50:14,384
inside the Kreditbank.

1039
00:50:14,385 --> 00:50:16,166
Chief Mattsson has
confirmed that

1040
00:50:16,167 --> 00:50:18,471
one of the hostages,
Miss Bianca Lind,

1041
00:50:18,472 --> 00:50:20,600
has been killed by Lars Nystrom.

1042
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:23,644
Did her bizarre trust in
him lead to her death?

1043
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:27,557
And why are authorities
loading tear gas into the bank?

1044
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:29,992
They are growing desperate
to end this ordeal,

1045
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:32,992
but they must now await Prime
Minister Palme's approval

1046
00:50:32,993 --> 00:50:36,079
to let Nystrom leave with
the remaining hostages.

1047
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:39,297
I'm Vincent Oberg, live
from Central Stockholm.

1048
00:50:39,298 --> 00:50:40,514
They're buying for time.

1049
00:50:42,428 --> 00:50:45,992
They're gonna drill a
hole through the ceiling,

1050
00:50:45,993 --> 00:50:48,166
and then they're gonna
give us the tear gas.

1051
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:50,427
No, don't worry, there's
solid concrete up there.

1052
00:50:52,037 --> 00:50:53,905
Did I ever tell you
about my buddy, Pete?

1053
00:50:53,906 --> 00:50:55,123
Pete Noonan?

1054
00:50:55,124 --> 00:50:56,340
Who?

1055
00:50:56,341 --> 00:50:58,166
My Vietnam Navy buddy?

1056
00:50:58,167 --> 00:51:01,774
Got exposed to that gas, 90
seconds, scrambled his brain.

1057
00:51:01,775 --> 00:51:03,645
I mean, he's a
babbling idiot now.

1058
00:51:15,732 --> 00:51:16,861
Yep.

1059
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,471
What is that?

1060
00:51:30,037 --> 00:51:31,818
You hear that?

1061
00:51:31,819 --> 00:51:33,123
Yeah, I hear it.

1062
00:51:33,124 --> 00:51:34,557
What is it?

1063
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:36,339
I don't know.

1064
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,819
Get in here,
get in here. Both of you.

1065
00:51:52,558 --> 00:51:54,339
What is it?

1066
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,427
You see anything?

1067
00:51:59,253 --> 00:52:00,644
A microphone.

1068
00:52:00,645 --> 00:52:02,513
A microphone?

1069
00:52:02,514 --> 00:52:03,513
Let me see.

1070
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:06,601
What do you mean?

1071
00:52:08,862 --> 00:52:10,166
Outside.

1072
00:52:12,819 --> 00:52:15,252
Come here, come.

1073
00:52:22,471 --> 00:52:24,991
Wait in here.

1074
00:52:30,427 --> 00:52:32,383
You're alive.

1075
00:52:32,384 --> 00:52:33,905
Oh, my God.

1076
00:52:33,906 --> 00:52:35,861
I thought you were dead.

1077
00:52:35,862 --> 00:52:37,687
Oh,

1078
00:52:37,688 --> 00:52:38,687
my God.

1079
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:40,165
Oh, my God.

1080
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:42,252
Come here, come here.

1081
00:52:42,253 --> 00:52:43,471
Let me see you.

1082
00:52:44,819 --> 00:52:48,514
Oh, God, oh.

1083
00:52:50,558 --> 00:52:52,687
It just went black
when I hit the floor.

1084
00:52:52,688 --> 00:52:53,732
Shh.

1085
00:52:56,297 --> 00:52:58,860
They slipped a microphone
in here, they're listening.

1086
00:52:58,861 --> 00:53:01,209
We have to be quiet.

1087
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:03,557
They think we don't know.

1088
00:53:03,558 --> 00:53:05,817
So now, we talk
for the microphone,

1089
00:53:05,818 --> 00:53:08,122
try to get everyone out.

1090
00:53:08,123 --> 00:53:09,209
When he gets here,

1091
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:11,035
we'll figure out what to say.

1092
00:53:11,036 --> 00:53:12,687
We need to speak loudly

1093
00:53:13,861 --> 00:53:15,252
What the fuck?

1094
00:53:15,253 --> 00:53:16,252
Shit.

1095
00:53:17,514 --> 00:53:18,904
What's going on?

1096
00:53:18,905 --> 00:53:20,860
Well, it's the
same thing you did, man.

1097
00:53:20,861 --> 00:53:22,426
Same thing.

1098
00:53:22,427 --> 00:53:23,904
Careful, careful, careful.

1099
00:53:23,905 --> 00:53:25,209
Careful, careful, careful.
Sorry, sorry.

1100
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:26,209
Careful.

1101
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:27,209
Careful, careful, ya.

1102
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:28,600
I don't understand.

1103
00:53:28,601 --> 00:53:30,122
I pulled the same
stunt that you did.

1104
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,991
At, at the Goteberg robbery?
What?

1105
00:53:31,992 --> 00:53:33,600
When you shot Joelle,

1106
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:34,947
and he had the vest on
and you fooled everybody.

1107
00:53:34,948 --> 00:53:36,557
What are you talking about?

1108
00:53:36,558 --> 00:53:37,904
She's got a vest on.

1109
00:53:37,905 --> 00:53:39,252
What, I,
I taught you that?

1110
00:53:39,253 --> 00:53:40,513
Yeah.

1111
00:53:40,514 --> 00:53:41,730
You believed that story?

1112
00:53:41,731 --> 00:53:43,252
That didn't happen?

1113
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:44,340
Of course not.

1114
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:49,078
I mean, nice play,
Lars, it's risky,

1115
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:51,556
but it's fucking crazy, man.

1116
00:53:51,557 --> 00:53:55,122
I mean, how, how could you
not know she wasn't dead?

1117
00:53:55,123 --> 00:53:58,209
Well, I, I was, I don't know.

1118
00:53:58,210 --> 00:53:59,817
It's just a little bruise.

1119
00:53:59,818 --> 00:54:01,512
I got scared, man.

1120
00:54:01,513 --> 00:54:02,731
You got scared?

1121
00:54:03,905 --> 00:54:05,904
Listen, here's the plan, okay?

1122
00:54:05,905 --> 00:54:07,556
There's a microphone.

1123
00:54:07,557 --> 00:54:09,556
We can go in there, we
can say whatever we want,

1124
00:54:09,557 --> 00:54:12,599
but they have to believe
that Bianca is dead.

1125
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,599
Tch.

1126
00:54:16,513 --> 00:54:18,035
I need ice and painkillers.

1127
00:54:18,036 --> 00:54:19,905
Ice and pain killers?

1128
00:54:21,948 --> 00:54:23,731
You jerk.

1129
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,122
- Chief?
- Hmm?

1130
00:54:27,123 --> 00:54:28,644
They're back in the vault.

1131
00:54:31,861 --> 00:54:33,947
Ice and painkillers help

1132
00:54:33,948 --> 00:54:35,382
at this time of the month.

1133
00:54:35,383 --> 00:54:36,947
I'm, I'm really hungry.

1134
00:54:36,948 --> 00:54:39,469
Quit your bitchin'
or I'll kill you too.

1135
00:54:43,687 --> 00:54:45,599
Yeah, yeah, Mattsson here.

1136
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,817
Chief Mattsson, now
you've got one dead hostage,

1137
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:49,252
you want another?

1138
00:54:49,253 --> 00:54:50,512
Are you gonna let us
drive out of here?

1139
00:54:50,513 --> 00:54:52,425
I have the authority

1140
00:54:52,426 --> 00:54:53,904
to let you leave here
first thing in the morning.No.

1141
00:54:53,905 --> 00:54:55,643
Now put Gunnar on the line.

1142
00:54:55,644 --> 00:54:57,165
I'm not gonna
put Gunnar on the line.

1143
00:54:57,166 --> 00:54:59,512
You can talk to
me, I'm in charge.

1144
00:54:59,513 --> 00:55:00,904

Klara's scared.

1148
00:55:06,992 --> 00:55:08,382
She's got cramps.

1149
00:55:08,383 --> 00:55:09,599
We can send down a doctor.

1150
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,817
We don't need a doctor.

1151
00:55:10,818 --> 00:55:12,078
We need ice and painkillers.

1152
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,078
And food.

1153
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:14,164

1155
00:55:15,426 --> 00:55:16,469

Want one?

You're not allowed
to smoke in the vault.

00:55:28,644 --> 00:55:30,687
Well, Klara,

1159
00:55:31,731 --> 00:55:34,251
this is my vault now.

1160
00:55:34,252 --> 00:55:35,251

1161
00:55:36,905 --> 00:55:38,296

- Yeah.

1279
01:01:05,121 --> 01:01:06,728

01:01:14,903 --> 01:01:16,294
Okay, Ingemar... And then turn up the heat.

1286
01:01:16,295 --> 01:01:18,120
Yes, but... To suffocate them.

1287

Listen to what I'm saying.

1288
01:01:19,642 --> 01:01:21,250
And then we freeze them. Ingemar?

1289
01:01:21,251 --> 01:01:22,945
And then back again,

1290
01:01:22,946 --> 01:01:24,294
on, off, on, off, on, off,
on, Hang on, Ingemar, they're

01:01:25,424 --> 01:01:27,120
What's gotten into you? No.

1293
01:01:27,121 --> 01:01:28,858
It's the hostages
I'm thinking of. Yeah, the hostages

1294
01:01:28,859 --> 01:01:30,554
They have not eaten or drank... If
the hostages want our help

1295
01:01:30,555 --> 01:01:32,294
they need to show
us some respect.

1296
01:01:32,295 --> 01:01:33,728
All I am say...

1297
01:01:33,729 --> 01:01:35,597
Oh, they... you look
what they're doing.

1298
01:01:35,598 --> 01:01:37,163
Those criminals that
think they're in charge.

1299
01:01:37,164 --> 01:01:38,467
But we are in charge.

1300
01:01:38,468 --> 01:01:40,120
So let's turn up the heat,

1301
01:01:40,121 --> 01:01:42,120
and when they call
us, they will,

1302
01:01:42,121 --> 01:01:43,945
you do not answer the
phones, you hear me?

1303

1304
01:01:45,294 --> 01:01:46,598
I do Chief. Then get to it.

1305
01:01:48,511 --> 01:01:50,336
Okay, you heard him, okay?

1306
01:01:50,337 --> 01:01:51,685
The heat goes up, yeah, go.

1307
01:02:26,511 --> 01:02:28,293
This was a bad idea.

1308
01:02:28,294 --> 01:02:29,294
What was?

1309
01:02:30,381 --> 01:02:31,380
All of it.

1310
01:02:31,381 --> 01:02:32,380
Everything.

1311
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:33,510
How can you say that?

1312
01:02:33,511 --> 01:02:34,989
How could you say that?

1313
01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:38,162
They're about to gas
us to death, alright?

1314
01:02:38,163 --> 01:02:39,598
And you're taking their side?

1315
01:02:40,555 --> 01:02:42,336
If I was on their side.

1316
01:02:46,424 --> 01:02:47,597
If I was on their side,

1317
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:49,858
you would be dead by now.

1318
01:02:53,642 --> 01:02:55,249
Shit.

1319
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:57,032
I'm not gonna let
you gas us to death!

1320
01:02:57,033 --> 01:02:58,249
No, Lars!

1321
01:02:58,250 --> 01:02:59,510
No, no!

1322
01:03:02,468 --> 01:03:03,468
Cover the bloody hole!

1323
01:03:05,163 --> 01:03:06,641
Get the medic!

1324
01:03:06,642 --> 01:03:07,771
A medic!

1325
01:03:07,772 --> 01:03:09,206
No gas!

1326
01:03:09,207 --> 01:03:10,206
No gas!

1327
01:03:10,207 --> 01:03:11,901
No! Lars. No!

1328
01:03:11,902 --> 01:03:13,554
Use your head.

1329
01:03:13,555 --> 01:03:15,336
You kill a cop, we're all dead.

1330
01:03:15,337 --> 01:03:16,380
You killed a cop.

1331
01:03:16,381 --> 01:03:17,380
I did not.

1332
01:03:17,381 --> 01:03:18,467
Yes, you did.

1333
01:03:18,468 --> 01:03:19,944
That was my idiot partner.

1334
01:03:19,945 --> 01:03:21,249
- Oh, my God!
- I'm not so stupid!

1335
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:23,293
You were there,
you got accessory!

1336
01:03:23,294 --> 01:03:24,988
I did not pull the trigger.

1337
01:03:24,989 --> 01:03:26,642
Not dead, anyway.

1338
01:03:27,598 --> 01:03:28,597
Oh, yeah?

1339
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:32,467
Is that it? Huh?

1340
01:03:32,468 --> 01:03:33,770
Put it down. You put it down.

1341
01:03:33,771 --> 01:03:35,554
Put it down.

1342
01:03:35,555 --> 01:03:37,119
- You put it down.
- Please, stop this.

1343
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,207
Please, listen to me.

1344
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,684
Please.

1345
01:03:40,685 --> 01:03:41,858
Please, stop.

1346
01:03:46,424 --> 01:03:48,944
C'mon, Gunnar.

1347
01:03:48,945 --> 01:03:52,944
Oh, that's
the way it is, huh?

1348
01:03:52,945 --> 01:03:54,901
So either I bust you out,

1349
01:03:54,902 --> 01:03:56,901
or you turn me in,

1350
01:03:56,902 --> 01:03:58,467
or you kill me, huh?

1351
01:03:58,468 --> 01:04:01,423
It's a win win for
you, is that it, huh?

1352
01:04:01,424 --> 01:04:04,206
I've been giving you second
chances all your life, Lars.

1353
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:09,119
I know, that is what brothers
do for each other, man!

1354
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,468
That is what having
each other's back means!

1355
01:04:13,424 --> 01:04:16,206
Look, you don't wanna leave
me with me, I don't wanna go.

1356
01:04:16,207 --> 01:04:17,206
Turn me in.

1357
01:04:17,207 --> 01:04:18,683
Turn me in, I don't care.

1358
01:04:18,684 --> 01:04:19,683
What are they offering you, huh?

1359
01:04:19,684 --> 01:04:20,944
A lot.

1360
01:04:20,945 --> 01:04:22,032
Yeah, how much am I worth, huh?

1361
01:04:22,033 --> 01:04:23,944
I just said, a lot.

1362
01:04:23,945 --> 01:04:25,727
Huh, c'mon, put
the gun down. Let's fight. What?

1363
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:27,075
C'mon, man, let's fight!

1364
01:04:27,076 --> 01:04:28,162
C'mon, like old times, c'mon!

1365
01:04:28,163 --> 01:04:30,119
Put the gun down
and let's fight,

1366
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,553
and then you can turn me in,

1367
01:04:31,554 --> 01:04:32,988
and I won't even tell everybody

1368
01:04:32,989 --> 01:04:34,032
how you've turned into
a little bitch cop

1369
01:04:34,033 --> 01:04:35,119
who stabbed me in the back.

1370
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,250
Oh, my God.

1371
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:38,814
He's like a child!

1372
01:04:38,815 --> 01:04:40,249
Oh!

1373
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,857
Stop!

1374
01:05:07,858 --> 01:05:09,336
Stop!

1375
01:05:10,684 --> 01:05:11,989
It's enough, stop!

1376
01:05:13,293 --> 01:05:14,727
Off me!

1377
01:05:18,293 --> 01:05:20,684
It's enough.
It's enough.

1378
01:05:31,249 --> 01:05:32,901
It's okay.

1379
01:05:32,902 --> 01:05:34,292
Do it.

1380
01:05:34,293 --> 01:05:35,684
Pull the trigger.

1381
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:38,553
I don't wanna see you killed.

1382
01:05:38,554 --> 01:05:39,553
Please?

1383
01:05:40,858 --> 01:05:41,902
Just do it.

1384
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:02,944
Look who's got both guns now.

1385
01:06:02,945 --> 01:06:04,640
Oh. Gee...

1386
01:06:04,641 --> 01:06:06,857
Let's just all relax now.

1387
01:06:06,858 --> 01:06:07,988
Yeah?

1388
01:06:09,597 --> 01:06:10,945
Alright.

1389
01:06:12,554 --> 01:06:13,553
We good?

1390
01:06:15,554 --> 01:06:17,467
Oh, we're great, Lars, yeah.

1391
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:29,032
Alright, let's get some rest.

1392
01:06:30,554 --> 01:06:32,119
Gotta be alert on those roads.

1393
01:06:34,293 --> 01:06:36,553
I'm very sorry, Frederick.

1394
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:00,162
Let me see.

1395
01:07:08,119 --> 01:07:09,336
It's gonna be okay.

1396
01:07:11,336 --> 01:07:12,380
You were...

1397
01:07:13,944 --> 01:07:15,683
you were unbelievably
brave, you know?

1398
01:07:17,206 --> 01:07:18,900
Really.

1399
01:07:20,683 --> 01:07:22,162
I've never seen
anything like it.

1400
01:07:23,423 --> 01:07:24,987
It's incredible.

1401
01:07:24,988 --> 01:07:27,031
Yeah, I was very brave.

1402
01:07:27,032 --> 01:07:28,032
Lars?

1403
01:07:29,814 --> 01:07:31,206
Can I call home?

1404
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:39,380
You can't, no.
I mean, you can't.

1405
01:07:41,206 --> 01:07:42,423
My...

1406
01:07:44,988 --> 01:07:46,032
my daughter

1407
01:07:47,206 --> 01:07:48,553
probably thinks I'm dead and,

1408
01:07:50,075 --> 01:07:51,162
and my parents, I

1409
01:07:52,901 --> 01:07:55,379
I can't even imagine what
they're going through.

1410
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:57,335
They just have to right now.

1411
01:07:57,336 --> 01:07:58,813
For a little bit longer.

1412
01:07:58,814 --> 01:08:01,074
It's the only way we're
gonna get out of here.

1413
01:08:01,075 --> 01:08:03,422
It's the only thing
that makes it worth it.

1414
01:08:03,422 --> 01:08:04,640
Yeah.

1415
01:08:06,162 --> 01:08:08,421
Okay.

1416
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:12,595
My father wishes I died a
long time ago, you know, so.

1417
01:08:12,596 --> 01:08:15,248
No. Yeah, no,
you're better off...

1418
01:08:15,249 --> 01:08:16,900
Yeah.

1419
01:08:16,901 --> 01:08:18,726
I mean, look, I mean, I don't
want it to sound like that.

1420
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:21,639
Like I, I hate it when,
you know, professionals

1421
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,118
act like it's all their
parents fault, you know?

1422
01:08:24,119 --> 01:08:27,465
I mean, I, I deserved every
sentence I've ever gotten.

1423
01:08:27,466 --> 01:08:29,334
And then some.

1424
01:08:29,335 --> 01:08:31,465
You were not afraid of prison?

1425
01:08:31,466 --> 01:08:33,378
No, it's just

1426
01:08:33,379 --> 01:08:35,378
once you start making
money the easy way,

1427
01:08:35,379 --> 01:08:37,119
you can't go back.

1428
01:08:38,335 --> 01:08:40,291
And then I stabbed somebody.

1429
01:08:40,292 --> 01:08:41,856
What?

1430
01:08:41,857 --> 01:08:44,118
I did, I, um,
there was this kiddiefiddler.

1431
01:08:44,119 --> 01:08:45,335
Like a real creep, like.

1432
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,421
Gunnar and I knew it for a fact.

1433
01:08:48,422 --> 01:08:50,856
He lived down the hall from
us and we, we found out,

1434
01:08:50,857 --> 01:08:52,901
and I took a butter
knife and I stabbed him.

1435
01:08:58,814 --> 01:08:59,944
And Gunnar was

1436
01:09:01,683 --> 01:09:03,031
with you, you, you were

1437
01:09:03,032 --> 01:09:05,247
living with Gunnar? Yeah, uhhuh, uhhuh.

1438
01:09:05,248 --> 01:09:08,161
And then we were
cellmates.

1439
01:09:11,727 --> 01:09:14,204
You really love
him, don't you?

1440
01:09:14,205 --> 01:09:17,205
- He's like my brother.
- Hmm.

1441
01:09:18,032 --> 01:09:19,379
You know, he was,

1442
01:09:20,988 --> 01:09:22,292
he was really a,

1443
01:09:24,857 --> 01:09:26,900
you know, he was really
strong, you know?

1444
01:09:26,901 --> 01:09:28,422
He taught me everything.

1445
01:09:29,074 --> 01:09:30,161
Ya know?

1446
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:34,770
I don't know, Lars.

1447
01:11:06,509 --> 01:11:08,465
We're going
to send in tear gas.

1448
01:11:08,466 --> 01:11:10,551
You have one minute to give up.

1449
01:11:10,552 --> 01:11:12,465
Place your weapons
into the bag,

1450
01:11:12,466 --> 01:11:14,768
slide it under the hole
so we can see them.

1451
01:11:14,769 --> 01:11:17,594
One minute or we start the gas.

1452
01:11:17,595 --> 01:11:19,291
No, no, no, no, no!

1453
01:11:19,292 --> 01:11:20,291
What do you mean, you
said you were gonna...

1454
01:11:20,292 --> 01:11:21,378
One minute!

1455
01:11:21,379 --> 01:11:22,681
It's not the phone.

1456
01:11:22,682 --> 01:11:24,204
You have to press
the red button.

1457
01:11:24,205 --> 01:11:25,594
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey?

1458
01:11:25,595 --> 01:11:26,594
Hey, you said you
were gonna let us go?

1459
01:11:26,595 --> 01:11:28,073
Things have changed.

1460
01:11:28,074 --> 01:11:29,421
- What do you mean? What?
- Lars?

1461
01:11:29,422 --> 01:11:30,899
- We should do what he says.
- Fuck no!

1462
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,160
No way, man!

1463
01:11:32,161 --> 01:11:33,551
You, you, you said we could go!

1464
01:11:33,552 --> 01:11:35,204
One minute!

1465
01:11:35,205 --> 01:11:37,247
How can they do that,
they can't gas us all!

1466
01:11:37,248 --> 01:11:38,681
I know they wanna
kill me, but for what?

1467
01:11:38,682 --> 01:11:40,160
- Toss the guns in the bag.
- No way!

1468
01:11:40,161 --> 01:11:42,291
- The guns in the bag!
- Fuck you! No!

1469
01:11:42,292 --> 01:11:43,551
No retreat, man!

1470
01:11:43,552 --> 01:11:45,681
Why would they wanna
kill all of us?

1471
01:11:45,682 --> 01:11:47,855
What you doing with
that? Put that down. Hey, don't touch her!

1472
01:11:47,856 --> 01:11:49,247
Do not fucking touch her!
Calm down! Calm down!

1473
01:11:49,248 --> 01:11:51,247
I will blow your head off!

1474
01:11:51,248 --> 01:11:52,247
Are you okay?

1475
01:11:56,421 --> 01:11:58,074
I have an idea.

1476
01:12:02,813 --> 01:12:04,551
We're sending
in the gas Lars.

1477
01:12:04,552 --> 01:12:05,942
Yeah, no, that's great,

1478
01:12:05,943 --> 01:12:08,204
you just a, you pump the gas in,

1479
01:12:08,205 --> 01:12:11,986
and then, ah, Elov and
Klara will die, no problem.

1480
01:12:11,987 --> 01:12:14,030
They will be just fine.

1481
01:12:14,031 --> 01:12:15,464
No, no, no,
they, they won't be fine.

1482
01:12:15,465 --> 01:12:16,507
They have nooses
around their necks,

1483
01:12:16,508 --> 01:12:17,507
so when you put the gas in,

1484
01:12:17,508 --> 01:12:18,942
they'll pass out,

1485
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,900
and then they'll be
strangled to death,

1486
01:12:19,901 --> 01:12:21,378
and it'll be your fault.

1487
01:12:22,769 --> 01:12:25,160
What nooses? I
don't believe you.

1488
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:28,291
The nooses I
put around their necks.

1489
01:12:30,595 --> 01:12:33,725
Uh... let me see.

1490
01:12:33,726 --> 01:12:35,074
Hold on a minute.

1491
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:38,725
Set up the CCTV camera,
bring it over here.

1492
01:12:38,726 --> 01:12:40,764
We're gonna place it inside
the hole to take a look.

1493
01:12:42,595 --> 01:12:44,855
We're sending down a
camera through the hole.

1494
01:12:44,856 --> 01:12:47,116
Now stay away,

1495
01:12:47,117 --> 01:12:50,030
and don't do any
bloody shooting.

1496
01:12:50,031 --> 01:12:52,159
Oh, shit, get down,
get down, get down.

1497
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,638
On the ground like you're
dead, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

1498
01:12:53,639 --> 01:12:54,769
Get down.

1499
01:13:02,247 --> 01:13:03,900
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1500
01:13:05,421 --> 01:13:06,856
Now you let them free.

1501
01:13:08,465 --> 01:13:11,072
All you have to do
is give me what I want,

1502
01:13:11,073 --> 01:13:13,333
and let me leave
with my hostages

1503
01:13:13,334 --> 01:13:15,290
and all this will be over.

1504
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:17,507
Let them out of those nooses!

1505
01:13:17,508 --> 01:13:18,813
Understood?

1506
01:13:27,073 --> 01:13:28,073
Chief?

1507
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,203
You go down there.

1508
01:13:30,204 --> 01:13:31,333
What you mean me?

1509
01:13:31,334 --> 01:13:32,638
I can go. No!

1510
01:13:32,639 --> 01:13:34,725
I need you here.

1511
01:13:34,726 --> 01:13:37,854
You go down and
you let them out.

1512
01:13:37,855 --> 01:13:40,769
Just go on, I, I've
lost all, bloody...

1513
01:13:42,726 --> 01:13:43,812
Go on.

1514
01:13:44,942 --> 01:13:46,203
Okay, we're gonna open the door

1515
01:13:46,204 --> 01:13:48,420
and let them go, hang tight.

1516
01:13:48,421 --> 01:13:50,768
Fuck! I mean, I'm sorry,
I'm coming down.

1517
01:13:52,552 --> 01:13:54,898
Do it, do it, do
it, do it, open the door!

1518
01:13:54,899 --> 01:13:55,986
Open the door!

1519
01:13:58,247 --> 01:14:00,942
Jesus Christ, I
really fucked it up.

1520
01:14:07,899 --> 01:14:09,138
I'm going to open the door now.

1521
01:14:13,508 --> 01:14:15,637
- Alright, back up, back up, back up!
- Okay, easy.

1522
01:14:15,638 --> 01:14:16,898
Back up.Easy.

1523
01:14:16,899 --> 01:14:18,724
Why are you here?
Where's Mattsson?

1524
01:14:18,725 --> 01:14:20,072
He sent me.

1525
01:14:20,073 --> 01:14:21,073
Your car's ready.

1526
01:14:22,725 --> 01:14:26,593
And he says that your
deal is over, Sorensson.

1527
01:14:26,594 --> 01:14:28,290
You're in this all the way now.

1528
01:14:28,291 --> 01:14:29,421
Huh.

1529
01:14:39,073 --> 01:14:40,290
Keep your eye on the front door.

1530
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:41,854
See if you can take him.

1531
01:14:41,855 --> 01:14:43,680
Stand back everybody.

1532
01:14:45,421 --> 01:14:47,377
Everybody behind the line.

1533
01:14:47,378 --> 01:14:48,854
I can't wait
to take a shower.

1534
01:14:48,855 --> 01:14:49,986
I'm quitting this job.

1535
01:14:59,334 --> 01:15:01,941
So what's gonna
happen to us, man?

1536
01:15:01,942 --> 01:15:03,550
Let's just get to France,

1537
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:05,116
and then we'll see what happens.

1538
01:15:05,117 --> 01:15:07,159
Most likely you go your
way, I go mine, right?

1539
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,855
I think so, yes.

1540
01:15:14,942 --> 01:15:16,811
You gonna give me the gun?

1541
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:18,855
Why, you gonna help me?

1542
01:15:19,986 --> 01:15:21,247
It's up to you.

1543
01:15:54,986 --> 01:15:57,507
Klara, come with me.

1544
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:00,637
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1545
01:16:04,073 --> 01:16:07,898
<i>♪ One and one is two ♪</i>

1546
01:16:07,899 --> 01:16:12,116
<i>♪ Whoa, you know I'll
take care of you ♪</i>

1547
01:16:13,507 --> 01:16:15,680
<i>♪ I'll take care of you ♪</i>

1548
01:16:23,507 --> 01:16:25,637
Why did he leave
that radio behind?

1549
01:16:25,638 --> 01:16:27,637
- What do you mean?
- Well, it's for her.

1550
01:16:27,638 --> 01:16:30,941
Yeah, he's a tender
brute, that Lars.

1551
01:16:30,942 --> 01:16:32,594
Ibsen?

1552
01:16:34,072 --> 01:16:35,984
Send in some gas.

1553
01:16:35,985 --> 01:16:38,419
Just enough to bring
someone back from the dead.

1554
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:40,071
Yes, Chief.

1555
01:16:40,072 --> 01:16:43,506
There's no harm if
she really is dead.

1556
01:16:43,507 --> 01:16:44,593
Is it?

1557
01:17:29,767 --> 01:17:31,420
The money is in the trunk.

1558
01:17:33,594 --> 01:17:35,637
Just keep your eyes on her.

1559
01:17:37,551 --> 01:17:38,940
Get in the
middle, get in, get in

1560
01:17:38,941 --> 01:17:41,853
get in, get in, get in.
Go in back.

1561
01:17:41,854 --> 01:17:43,679
Back off, easy, easy.

1562
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:44,679
Listen to me.

1563
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,245
Listen to me.

1564
01:17:46,246 --> 01:17:47,593
We've cleared the traffic
along the Hamngaten.

1565
01:17:47,594 --> 01:17:49,159
You can take that
to the highway.

1566
01:17:50,377 --> 01:17:51,507
Clear the way!

1567
01:17:53,985 --> 01:17:55,853
There's nothing, Chief.

1568
01:17:55,854 --> 01:17:57,593
No, yeah, it was worth a try.

1569
01:17:59,246 --> 01:18:00,724
Just turn it off.

1570
01:18:03,811 --> 01:18:04,811
Wait, do you see that?

1571
01:18:07,246 --> 01:18:08,766
It's the Chief.

1572
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:10,419
Listen very carefully.

1573
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:12,766
Oh, listen to that purr!

1574
01:18:12,767 --> 01:18:15,550
Hahahaha, yes, yes!

1575
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:19,158
Oh, yeah! Alright, here we go!

1576
01:18:20,246 --> 01:18:22,505
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

1577
01:18:22,506 --> 01:18:24,245
- Oh, my God, oh, my God!
- Hold your fire!

1578
01:18:24,246 --> 01:18:27,071
Hold your fire, who did that?

1579
01:18:27,072 --> 01:18:28,766
- I'm gonna kill her!
- I'm gonna blow his

1580
01:18:28,767 --> 01:18:30,028
- brains out right now!
- It was a mistake!

1581
01:18:30,029 --> 01:18:31,159
It was a mistake, I'm sorry!

1582
01:18:33,463 --> 01:18:35,289
- Hold your fire!
- Was that gunfire?

1583
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:37,158
Hey, you want
me to kill him?

1584
01:18:37,159 --> 01:18:40,332
I will blow his brains
all over this car!

1585
01:18:40,333 --> 01:18:43,028
Right on National TV!
We'll replace the tires.

1586
01:18:43,029 --> 01:18:44,984
- Calm down.
- You lied to me, man.

1587
01:18:44,985 --> 01:18:46,331
- Come out and I'll, I'll
- LARS: No!

1588
01:18:46,332 --> 01:18:48,158
- Escort you to the lobby
- LARS: No!

1589
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:49,984
While they find a new tire.
I'm not leaving this car.

1590
01:18:49,985 --> 01:18:51,679
- Lars, I'm not going back in there.
- I'm not...

1591
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,549
Look into the
eyes of those men.

1592
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:55,071
Those volunteers,
they're terrified.

1593
01:18:55,072 --> 01:18:56,375
You're not safe out here.

1594
01:18:56,376 --> 01:18:58,331
I don't trust them anymore.

1595
01:18:58,332 --> 01:18:59,506
I will kill her.

1596
01:19:00,637 --> 01:19:02,202
Let's go.

1597
01:19:02,203 --> 01:19:04,202
Back off!
Back off! Back off!

1598
01:19:04,203 --> 01:19:05,592
- Stand down, stand down!
- Everybody back off,

1599
01:19:05,593 --> 01:19:07,071
or I'll blow her brains out.
Hold your fire!

1600
01:19:07,072 --> 01:19:08,244
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! Hold your fire!

1601
01:19:08,245 --> 01:19:09,244
Back up!

1602
01:19:10,637 --> 01:19:12,245
I hate you! I hate you!

1603
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:15,331
Hold your fire!

1604
01:19:15,332 --> 01:19:17,375
I don't
know what happened.

1605
01:19:17,376 --> 01:19:19,462
You'll be safer in here.

1606
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:22,028
This is so bad,
man, this is so bad.

1607
01:19:22,029 --> 01:19:24,157
Ah, yes, it's terrible, I
don't understand what happened.

1608
01:19:24,158 --> 01:19:25,853
I'm very sorry.

1609
01:19:25,854 --> 01:19:28,244
You tell them to
stop pointing their guns.

1610
01:19:28,245 --> 01:19:30,766
You tell them to stop
pointing their guns, man!

1611
01:19:30,767 --> 01:19:32,592
And now we'll
just wait in here

1612
01:19:32,593 --> 01:19:34,419
until they replace that tire.

1613
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:37,766
And in the meantime,
we should ah,

1614
01:19:37,767 --> 01:19:40,375
get Mrs. Lind's body
out of there, huh?

1615
01:19:40,376 --> 01:19:43,679
Have you, no, do you have the,

1616
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,375
you have the key to the vault?

1617
01:19:45,376 --> 01:19:46,419
Please?

1618
01:19:48,376 --> 01:19:49,811
Let's go back to the vault.

1619
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:53,288
I'm not going
back to the vault.

1620
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:55,679
- C'mon, man, we got to.
- Please?

1621
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,941
No, you never go back.
Never go back!

1622
01:20:00,115 --> 01:20:02,593
You don't want to leave her
in there. It's not right.

1623
01:20:04,419 --> 01:20:05,679
We're going back to the vault.

1624
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:07,332
- Shit!
- C'mon.

1625
01:20:08,898 --> 01:20:11,027
Put your guns down.

1626
01:20:11,028 --> 01:20:12,202
Shame on you.

1627
01:20:15,115 --> 01:20:17,288
Alright, alright,
go, go, go, go, go.

1628
01:20:17,289 --> 01:20:18,983
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1629
01:20:23,332 --> 01:20:24,983
Oh, shit!

1630
01:20:24,984 --> 01:20:26,375
I got 'em, I got 'em.

1631
01:20:26,376 --> 01:20:27,549
Here, take this,
take this, take this.

1632
01:20:27,550 --> 01:20:28,983
- No closer.
- Ah, shit.

1633
01:20:28,984 --> 01:20:30,766
Got it, got it, got
it, got it, got it!

1634
01:20:30,767 --> 01:20:32,244
Give me that,
give me that, give me that,

1635
01:20:32,245 --> 01:20:33,592
- get in!
- In, in, in.

1636
01:20:33,593 --> 01:20:35,027
Get back!

1637
01:20:35,028 --> 01:20:36,723
Stay back!

1638
01:20:36,724 --> 01:20:38,418
Oh, you're
not going in as well?

1639
01:20:38,419 --> 01:20:40,939
Stay back.

1640
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:42,331
I have a confession to make,
BIANCA: Get out. Get out, they know!

1641
01:20:42,332 --> 01:20:44,201
Lars? Lars! Wait.

1642
01:20:44,202 --> 01:20:45,549
I know Mrs. Lind
is not inside the vault.

1643
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:46,723
Hey!

1644
01:20:46,724 --> 01:20:47,852
Turn on the gas!

1645
01:20:47,853 --> 01:20:48,897
Turn on the gas!

1646
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:52,896
- Oh, God.
- Guys!

1647
01:20:52,897 --> 01:20:54,549
- No gas!
- Help!

1648
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:56,418
No gas! Oh shit, man,
it's gonna go to our brains.

1649
01:20:56,419 --> 01:20:58,679
Oh fuck, no! No!

1650
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,810
- No, turn off the gas!
- I can't breathe.

1651
01:21:02,506 --> 01:21:04,070
I don't want to die!

1652
01:21:04,071 --> 01:21:06,244
Please? Please?

1653
01:21:07,637 --> 01:21:09,375
I'm not
going back to prison!

1654
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,983
You said we had a deal, I'm
not going back to prison.

1655
01:21:10,984 --> 01:21:13,722
I'm not going back.

1656
01:21:13,723 --> 01:21:15,070
I'll shoot her.

1657
01:21:15,071 --> 01:21:16,375
You hear me?

1658
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:18,505
No!

1659
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:19,722
You understand?

1660
01:21:19,723 --> 01:21:21,505
Turn off the gas!

1661
01:21:21,506 --> 01:21:23,722
I will kill her.
Turn it off or I'll shoot her.

1662
01:21:23,723 --> 01:21:26,331
Turn off the gas! Chief!
We need to turn off the gas.

1663
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:28,852
Your dead, Mattsson.

1664
01:21:28,853 --> 01:21:29,940
Turn off the gas!

1665
01:21:30,897 --> 01:21:32,288
Turn off the gas!

1666
01:21:32,289 --> 01:21:33,765
I'll kill
her, and make sure

1667
01:21:33,766 --> 01:21:35,325
- we do it properly this time.
- Nooooo!

1668
01:21:37,202 --> 01:21:39,635
Goddamnit, no gas!

1669
01:21:39,636 --> 01:21:40,897
No gas, we give up!

1670
01:21:42,332 --> 01:21:43,418
Please, help!

1671
01:21:43,419 --> 01:21:45,635
No more gas!

1672
01:21:45,636 --> 01:21:48,852
No more gas!
Place the guns where we can see them.

1673
01:21:48,853 --> 01:21:50,765
- Throw them in front of you.
- No more gas!

1674
01:21:50,766 --> 01:21:52,549
Gas masks everyone!

1675
01:21:54,158 --> 01:21:56,417
Get the hostages out first.

1676
01:21:56,418 --> 01:21:58,765
Lars and Gunnar are left
alone with us in there?

1677
01:21:58,766 --> 01:22:00,592
It was self defense, your honor.

1678
01:22:11,418 --> 01:22:13,288
Step back from the door!

1679
01:22:16,853 --> 01:22:17,983
Hostages first!

1680
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:18,983
C'mon!

1681
01:22:21,592 --> 01:22:22,765
I said up!

1682
01:22:22,766 --> 01:22:24,765
Stand up!

1683
01:22:24,766 --> 01:22:25,852
You ladies first.

1684
01:22:25,853 --> 01:22:27,070
C'mon.

1685
01:22:27,071 --> 01:22:28,549
Let's go together.

1686
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:31,287
They're gonna shoot Lars.

1687
01:22:33,288 --> 01:22:34,549
C'mon, c'mon.

1688
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:37,722
We're coming out.

1689
01:22:37,723 --> 01:22:39,287
Stay behind me.

1690
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:42,114
You have an angle on him?

1691
01:22:42,115 --> 01:22:43,852
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

1692
01:22:43,853 --> 01:22:45,636
Don't be afraid, sweetheart.

1693
01:22:46,505 --> 01:22:47,504
You're safe now.

1694
01:22:49,766 --> 01:22:52,071
You separate them before
they get to the lobby.

1695
01:23:01,723 --> 01:23:03,244
You wanna go back to prison?

1696
01:23:05,984 --> 01:23:07,201
Everyone got out alive.

1697
01:23:08,723 --> 01:23:10,374
Now you owe me my freedom.

1698
01:23:50,983 --> 01:23:52,505
Go, go, get, get, get.

1699
01:23:53,896 --> 01:23:56,330
No!

1700
01:24:02,288 --> 01:24:03,678
No.

1701
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:04,851
No!

1702
01:24:04,852 --> 01:24:06,417
No, please, don't hurt him.

1703
01:24:06,418 --> 01:24:07,417
Don't.

1704
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:19,548
All the hostages have been freed.

1705
01:24:19,549 --> 01:24:20,938
Including Mrs. Bianca Lind

1706
01:24:20,939 --> 01:24:22,721
who was previously thought dead.

1707
01:24:22,722 --> 01:24:24,591
This will surely go down as one

1708
01:24:24,592 --> 01:24:26,287
of the strangest episodes

1709
01:24:26,288 --> 01:24:28,069
On record, with
the entire nation

1710
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:31,200
captivated by
every twist and turn.

1711
01:24:31,201 --> 01:24:33,982
You can see the
exhaustion on their faces.

1712
01:24:33,983 --> 01:24:36,549
...a shellshocked
expression on their faces.

1713
01:24:38,201 --> 01:24:40,287
How do you feel, Mrs. Lind?

1714
01:24:59,201 --> 01:25:00,809
Get back to work, fellas.

1715
01:25:08,027 --> 01:25:09,635
You have a
visitor, Nystrom.

1716
01:25:11,375 --> 01:25:12,460
Who?

1717
01:25:12,461 --> 01:25:13,678
I don't know.

1718
01:25:19,504 --> 01:25:20,503
Bianca?

1719
01:25:22,201 --> 01:25:23,547
Oh, wow.

1720
01:25:35,678 --> 01:25:38,590
What are you doing here?

1721
01:25:38,591 --> 01:25:40,983
Have you, um,
heard from Gunnar?

1722
01:25:42,114 --> 01:25:43,547
He's free, you know?

1723
01:25:43,548 --> 01:25:44,809
He won his appeal hearing.

1724
01:25:46,504 --> 01:25:47,503
So he's out.

1725
01:25:48,983 --> 01:25:51,677
And I'm in.

1726
01:25:51,678 --> 01:25:53,069
Your ah,

1727
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:55,286
husband is okay?

1728
01:25:55,287 --> 01:25:57,764
Christopher, he's great.

1729
01:25:57,765 --> 01:25:59,503
He's a good man.

1730
01:25:59,504 --> 01:26:00,678
We're all good.

1731
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:05,591
What are you gonna
do when you get out?

1732
01:26:07,983 --> 01:26:09,461
Leave Sweden, I guess.

1733
01:26:19,330 --> 01:26:21,374
Why? Hey?

1734
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:24,765
What is it?

1735
01:26:26,330 --> 01:26:27,765
I don't know, I just,

1736
01:26:31,243 --> 01:26:33,809
I can't stop thinking about
what happened with us.

1737
01:26:36,461 --> 01:26:37,939
I still have a,

1738
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:42,026
a scar on my back
because of you.

1739
01:26:43,939 --> 01:26:44,983
But I'm alive.

1740
01:26:46,417 --> 01:26:47,765
I survived.

1
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:32,942
So many trees.

2
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,194
It's beautiful, right?

3
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,442
Well, it's definitely not Boston.

4
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,773
No, it's not.

5
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,026
Mom, make him stop.
It's not fair to Church.

6
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,492
I'm pretty sure Church is okay.

7
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,574
It's not actually Church
that I'm worried about.

8
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,228
We've still got another eight hours to go.

9
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,252
What?

10
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,412
Not funny, Dad.

11
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,422
That is so funny.

12
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,591
I got you good.

13
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,010
- Gage, did you find that funny?
- I thought it was funny.

14
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,919
What do you think?

15
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,044
- Wow.
- "Wow"? That's it?

16
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,967
It's pretty incredible, don't you think?

17
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,425
I even got them to throw in a whole forest
as a new backyard.

18
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,726
This whole place is ours?

19
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:52,681
This whole place is the new domain
of Ellie-phant the Great and Terrible.

20
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,319
I'll tell you what.
Do you want to be the first inside?

21
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,740
Go, go, go.

22
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:07,036
The movers were here all morning,
so everything should be inside.

23
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,122
Good.

24
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,168
Son of a bitch. You okay?

25
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,251
Yeah, it just startled me a little bit.

26
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,125
You okay, Gage?

27
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,739
- Big truck, huh?
- Who's a brave boy?

28
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,220
That was a big truck, wasn't it?

29
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,474
Okay. You ready, little man?

30
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:33,438
- Here we go. Come on.
- One, two, three!

31
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,559
Home.

32
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,854
Well, he adapted quickly.

33
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:42,276
What about you?
You ready for the country life, Doc?

34
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,774
Well, let's find out. Come on.

35
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,659
Mrs. Creed.

36
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,661
Wait, the cat's in the car!

37
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,584
This all happened pretty fast.
You gonna miss it?

38
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:06,591
I don't think anyone really misses
the graveyard shift in the ER.

39
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,764
I don't think
that really answered my question.

40
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:14,814
Hey.

41
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,894
You needed this.

42
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,897
We needed this.

43
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,693
I get to spend some more time
around the house...

44
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,821
- ...with the kids.
- And your stay-at-home wifey.

45
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,864
- I didn't even think about that.
- Yeah?

46
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,519
- I may have to rethink that.
- Oh, you will?

47
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,284
You stop that. Don't you do that.

48
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,210
Yeah...

49
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,889
Good morning, Marcella.

50
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,304
Ready for the storm?

51
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,968
We have someone already?

52
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,678
Bloody nose. Room 4.

53
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,222
Sounds serious.

54
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,496
Do you hear that?

55
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,979
What are they doing?

56
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,153
Looks like some sort of procession.

57
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,533
What's a procession?

58
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,411
It's like a parade, but not for fun.

59
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,209
Hey, let's go back inside
and watch a show.

60
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,545
I'm tired of unpacking boxes.

61
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,728
Sooner than that.

62
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,104
I mean, Ellie's birthday is coming
up in a few months.

63
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,798
I don't know why you're worried, Mom.
No, everything's fine.

64
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,220
The kids are really happy.

65
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,890
Yeah.

66
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,597
No, it's nice to slow down a little bit,
you know?

67
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,065
Hey, Mom, can I talk to you later?

68
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,906
Okay, love you. Bye.

69
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,950
Hey, Ellie, are you hungry?

70
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,694
Hey. You get down from there!

71
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,553
The trick is...

72
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,928
To get the stinger out real quick.

73
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:03,769
She's a big 'un.

74
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,012
No prize winner...

75
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,311
But she'll do for a ribbon.

76
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,777
There you go.

77
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,400
Yeah.

78
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,573
Should be starting to quiet down now.

79
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,029
You're the doctor's little girl.

80
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,029
Eleanor Creed. But you can call me Ellie.

81
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,368
I'm Judson Crandall.

82
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,583
You can call me Jud.

83
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,829
All right. Up you get.

84
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,965
- What is this place?
- Pet cemetery.

85
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,890
- Didn't you read the sign?
- Yeah. They spelled it wrong.

86
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,352
These are all people's pets?

87
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,771
Well, the whole town's been
using this place for generations.

88
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,184
I saw those kids.
They were all wearing those masks.

89
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,519
Yeah.

90
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:58,152
A lot of folks
make a kinda ritual out of it.

91
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,284
See this one over here?
I carved this myself.

92
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,737
That's my dog, Biffer.

93
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:09,246
And it's true. He was a hell of a sniffer.

94
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,421
Ellie?

95
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:17,254
You know better than
to wander off by yourself. Come here.

96
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:22,138
Mommy, this is Jud, our neighbor.
I got stung by a bee.

97
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,182
He pulled the stinger out.
It was a big 'un.

98
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,975
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

99
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,388
Nice to meet you, too.
I'm Rachel, Ellie's mom.

100
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,477
You know, these woods...

101
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,312
It's not really all that safe
to go roaming around in 'em.

102
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,363
People can get lost up here.

103
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:45,036
Thank you, Jud. We should get back, okay?

104
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,161
Honey, you can't wander off like that.

105
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,459
I don't know where you are.
I can't do anything...

106
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:57,415
Just wash the mud off and rub
some baking soda on that sting.

107
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,427
<i>Jud...</i>

108
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,347
<i>Come back...</i>

109
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,685
- Dad?
- Yeah?

110
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,108
Why don't pets live as long as people?

111
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,201
Well...

112
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,070
Do you remember that talk we had
about metabolism?

113
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,743
- The clock in your body?
- Yes.

114
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:35,958
Humans have a slow metabolism,
a slow clock, so we live longer.

115
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,498
Whereas cats and dogs...

116
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,842
Well, they have a fast metabolism.
Which means, when it runs out...

117
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,507
They die and go to the pet cemetery.

118
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,467
Yeah.

119
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,970
Ellie discovered
a charming little landmark

120
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,393
in the woods today,
right in our backyard.

121
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,143
Okay. Well, that doesn't have to
be such a bad thing, does it?

122
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,816
A place to bury our pets
and remember them.

123
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:01,111
It might seem scary, but it's not.
It's perfectly natural.

124
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,106
Just like dying is natural.

125
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,236
We all die and eventually,
one way or another,

126
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,071
we all go back into the ground.

127
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,406
What Daddy's trying to say

128
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,664
is that even though
the pet's body goes in the ground,

129
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:18,420
its soul keeps living and goes to heaven.

130
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,294
Just like Nana Creed.

131
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,251
Remember how I told you
she's looking down on you?

132
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:28,343
Well, we don't actually know
that it works exactly like that.

133
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,452
What Mommy and Daddy are trying to say

134
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,934
is that you don't have to worry
about this, sweetheart, okay?

135
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:36,435
Church and Mommy and me,
we're gonna be around a long, long time.

136
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,852
And Gage?

137
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,605
Of course, sweetie. Gage is just a kid.

138
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,361
But what about your sister, Mommy?

139
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,153
Wasn't she just a kid when she died?

140
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,745
Rachel...

141
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,412
Rachel.

142
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,504
You okay?

143
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,835
What was that in there?

144
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,670
Funny, I wanted to ask you the same thing.

145
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,468
Rachel, Ellie's almost nine years old.

146
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,119
We should be able
to talk to her about this.

147
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,725
Ellie's a child.

148
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,387
And death for her is scary.

149
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,334
Please, Rachel, doesn't mean
we should shield her from it.

150
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,849
And you think that's what I'm doing?

151
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:06,187
I think that all this talk
about the afterlife,

152
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,273
about people looking down on her,

153
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:13,702
I think it's delaying getting to
the heart of the matter, yes.

154
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:18,116
So, you really don't think
there's anything

155
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:23,663
after we die?
No heaven, no nothing?

156
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,334
No.

157
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,717
Right. We're gonna take a swab
and run a test for strep.

158
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,423
It could be allergies,

159
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,721
but we just want to be sure.

160
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,934
Marcella, please tell me
it's almost lunch.

161
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,836
If I have to look at another
pair of swollen tonsils,

162
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,022
- I swear to God...
- Judy went out for sandwiches.

163
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:49,906
His head!

164
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,107
Victor Pascow.

165
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,032
It's Victor Pascow.
He's a student here.

166
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,327
He was skating
and the car just came out of nowhere!

167
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,213
- He got dragged.
- Call LifeFlight to Bangor.

168
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,451
No time for an ambulance.

169
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,781
We need to get his blood type.
We'll need a lot of units.

170
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,187
We have to stabilize him
before we can transfer.

171
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,106
- He have a medical bracelet on?
- I didn't see anything, no.

172
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,167
I'm not gonna let you die, Victor. Shit.

173
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,087
Type O-positive. Pulling four units.

174
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,794
Great. Lie back, okay?
Just lie back. Lie back.

175
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,282
Let's hurry up with those units, okay?

176
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,306
Kelly, we're gonna need to fit him
with a cervical collar to get him lifted.

177
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,509
His brain. I can see it.

178
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,764
Kelly. Kelly, go!

179
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,721
Victor, please.

180
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,095
Where are we with those units?
He's losing a lot of blood!

181
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,028
No. No, no, no, Victor. No.
You stay with me, Victor.

182
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,857
You stay with me. I'm right here, Victor.
Stay right here...

183
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,494
Come...
Come back to me, Victor.

184
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,291
Come on.
Come back to me.

185
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,460
Come back. Come back.

186
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,336
God damn it.

187
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,251
Louis.

188
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:38,513
The barrier is not meant to be broken.

189
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,434
Louis?

190
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,393
He's gone.

191
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,981
Hey.

192
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,790
What happened?

193
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,580
This poor kid got hit by a car today
right on the campus.

194
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:59,048
He couldn't have been
more than 20 years old.

195
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,804
His name was Victor Pascow.

196
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,896
I sure wasn't expecting
to see any of that up here.

197
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,361
Why don't you come inside?

198
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,235
I'll make you some dinner.
You can take a shower. Okay?

199
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,657
I'm sorry.

200
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,572
He knew my name.

201
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,831
What?

202
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:30,752
He...

203
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,544
Nothing. Doesn't matter.

204
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,803
Jud? It's Ellie. I made cookies.

205
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,097
Are you home?

206
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,193
You in the habit
of going through other people's things?

207
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,568
Sorry.

208
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,486
Is that your wife?

209
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:51,115
Yeah. Her name was Norma.

210
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:52,584
She's pretty.

211
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:54,580
What happened to her?

212
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,418
Got sick. Passed away.

213
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:04,086
Well, maybe she's still out there.
You know, watching from heaven?

214
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,512
You think so, Ellie?

215
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,468
Hey, want to come meet my cat?

216
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,509
- His name is Church.
- Church?

217
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,595
That's short for Winston Churchill.

218
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,168
He's a guy who lived a long time ago.

219
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,557
I know who Winston Churchill is.

220
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,729
You must be really old.

221
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,734
I'm afraid so.

222
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,901
Very nice!

223
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,579
Very good.

224
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,702
Nice job. Bravo, sweetheart.

225
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,118
- Can you clap? Clap, clap.
- Well done, honey.

226
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,874
Thanks, folks, for having me over.

227
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,501
It's been a long time since
I've had any good home cooking.

228
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:42,082
How long have you lived here?

229
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,633
What, in Ludlow, or in that house?

230
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,753
- Either.
- All my life.

231
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,296
To both questions.

232
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,049
- Big fella!
- Church!

233
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,099
- He likes you.
- Well, I like him.

234
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,643
Church good kitty.

235
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,936
- Hey!
- Yes.

236
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,934
- Church good, good kitty.
- He is.

237
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,311
- Yeah.
- I was curious, Jud...

238
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,894
The realtor said the house
came with over 50 acres of woods.

239
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,859
That pet cemetery, do we own that, too?

240
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:08,192
Well, that's part of your property.

241
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,369
How far back is the property line?

242
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:16,663
Well, it's further
than you'd ever care to go.

243
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,847
<i>Louis.</i>

244
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,067
Come on, Doc.

245
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,680
<i>You tried to help me.</i>

246
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,512
<i>Now let me help you.</i>

247
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:20,624
<i>This is the place where the dead rest.</i>

248
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,377
<i>Do not go on to the place</i>

249
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,921
<i>where the dead walk.</i>

250
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:46,516
Stop! The ground is sour!

251
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:49,944
Wake up, Dada!

252
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,273
Hey, buddy.

253
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,279
Come here, come here, come here.

254
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,818
Come to Daddy.

255
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,534
I love you, Daddy.

256
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,450
Oh, man, thank you.

257
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,747
Time for Daddy to get up.

258
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,586
Hi.

259
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:17,968
- Good morning, sleepyhead.
- Hey.

260
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,799
Did you wake up Dada?

261
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,518
- Did you wake up Dada?
- What time is it?

262
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,936
It's late. You slept in.

263
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,160
- Hey, guys!
- Hi, Ellie.

264
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:42,457
What have you guys got?

265
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,123
I've got some candy corns, lollipops...

266
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,770
They also have really big gummy bears.

267
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:49,413
Okay, which one is the sheet
and which one is the ghost...

268
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,465
You look like a ghost, don't you?
You been busy already.

269
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,755
- You guys look great.
- Thank you.

270
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,156
We have to go to the Pattersons,

271
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,297
- 'cause they have the biggest candy...
- El...

272
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,598
- Take your broom, honey?
- Yeah.

273
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,720
Talk among yourselves.

274
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,346
- I'll be back, okay?
- Okay.

275
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,682
What are you doing, Jud?
You scaring the kids?

276
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,232
There's something you need to see.

277
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,241
All right.

278
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,586
Oh, no. Church.

279
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,427
One of those damn Orinco trucks.

280
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:40,051
- Dad!
- Shit.

281
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,553
- Dad!
- We can't let Ellie see this.

282
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,580
Come on, we got to go trick-or-treating

283
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,391
- with Zoe and Tyler.
- Yeah, honey.

284
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,081
I'm just gonna say a quick hello to Jud.

285
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,061
- Okay?
- I'll put a spell on you.

286
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,017
You already have, sweetheart.

287
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,146
You go wait in the car, honey.
I'll be right there.

288
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:01,993
You go with the kids.
Come back later, we'll take care of this.

289
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,531
Okay.

290
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,450
And, Louis...

291
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,995
We should do this tonight.

292
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,877
Sure, yeah.

293
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:21,633
You're sure?

294
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:24,716
Yeah, I'm sure.

295
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,310
I mean, he was all twisted.

296
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,645
Which brings me

297
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,977
to the fact that we have to tell Ellie.

298
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,049
- No, can we just tell her...
- Rachel. No, we need...

299
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,781
Can we just tell her
that he ran away, please?

300
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,702
You know, honey, I get it, okay?

301
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:48,372
I get it's difficult for you
to talk about death

302
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,260
after what you went through
with your sister,

303
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:52,502
but I think it's time
you finally opened up.

304
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:53,624
I'm just...

305
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,590
No, I'm just upset about Church.

306
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,760
Rachel, talk to me.
We both know this is about Zelda.

307
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:05,015
<i>Ever since moving here,
I can't stop thinking about her.</i>

308
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,511
<i>She hated me</i>

309
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:09,720
because my spine wasn't twisted like hers.

310
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:14,516
<i>She promised me that one day
I'd end up just like her.</i>

311
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:17,102
<i>I'd never get out of bed again.</i>

312
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,492
<i>My parents left me alone with her.
I was supposed to bring her dinner.</i>

313
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:27,070
<i>And so I used the dumbwaiter,
and I knew I wasn't supposed to</i>

314
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,655
<i>because it didn't work all the time.</i>

315
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,326
She died in there because of me.

316
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:22,839
I watched them wheel her body out,
but I swear she was still in the walls.

317
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,343
<i>And at night, I could hear hermoving,</i>

318
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,473
<i>calling out my name.</i>

319
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,471
<i>Rachel.</i>

320
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,261
I didn't know who to call.

321
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:36,393
But if I had just gone up to the room
and given her her food...

322
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:40,602
Your parents should never
have left you alone with her. Never.

323
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,278
That makes me a monster.

324
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,072
No, no, no, no, that does not
make you a monster.

325
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,694
Come on. Hey.

326
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,323
That does not make you a monster. Okay?

327
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:53,581
Tell you what.

328
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,952
Jud and I are gonna
take care of Church tonight. All right?

329
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:02,503
We'll just tell Ellie that he ran away.

330
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,092
- Okay? Yeah?
- Okay.

331
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,387
Just anything but dead.

332
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,645
I got a spot for you.

333
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,157
What is it?

334
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,491
Nothing. Let's get this over with.

335
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,371
It's cold.

336
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,841
<i>Jud...</i>

337
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,181
<i>Jud...</i>

338
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,432
Ellie really loved that cat, didn't she?

339
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,179
More than anything.

340
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,773
And you love Ellie.

341
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,189
Well, of course.

342
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:09,107
So, follow me.

343
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:10,407
What?

344
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:14,787
- I know all the spots to step.
- Jud, wait.

345
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,960
What's the matter with right here?

346
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,339
For chrissakes.

347
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:33,757
What the hell am I doing?

348
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,019
Jud, come on, wait up.

349
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,193
What the hell is this place?

350
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,094
Come a long way to bury a cat.

351
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,790
What was that?

352
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,710
It's just a loon.

353
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,130
Come on.

354
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,463
What is this place?

355
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,971
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

356
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,299
Bury your animal.

357
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,600
I'd help you,
but you have to do it yourself.

358
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:49,316
And use some of these rocks
to make a cairn.

359
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,903
- Kind of like the other ones.
- Okay.

360
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,387
What exactly are we
doing here tonight, Jud?

361
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:21,132
We're burying your daughter's cat.

362
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:26,855
And that's all?

363
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,390
That and nothing but.

364
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,491
You did good, Louis.

365
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,203
I knew you would.

366
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,093
What time is it?

367
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,852
It's late.

368
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,061
Did you and Jud take care of everything?

369
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,767
Yeah, it's done.

370
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,278
Thank you.

371
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,900
What is it?

372
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,154
It's Church, honey.

373
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:27,789
Yeah.

374
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,422
Daddy and Jud went out last night
to look for Church, and...

375
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,795
We looked all around and we...

376
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,711
Well, sweetheart, we couldn't find him.

377
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,296
And so we think...

378
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,015
We think Church ran away, sweetheart.

379
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:47,643
- Yeah.
- He didn't run away.

380
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,058
Well...

381
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,473
He was outside my window last night.

382
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:57,521
Honey, maybe you had a dream
that you saw him.

383
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:01,691
It's okay to be confused about all this...

384
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,165
You just have to accept that
he might not come home.

385
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,086
I'm sorry, sweetie.

386
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,957
He came back last night.

387
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:15,839
Look.

388
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,040
He's right there.

389
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,903
I thought you said he was dead.

390
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,609
He was.

391
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,911
He must've been unconscious,
in shock or something.

392
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,535
Good thing you're not a fucking vet.

393
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:00,667
Jud.

394
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,257
We need to have a little talk.

395
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,668
Ellie's cat is walking around over there
like nothing happened.

396
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:17,316
Well, I'll be damned.

397
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,393
What the fuck does that mean?

398
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,650
Well, isn't that what you wanted?

399
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:23,818
Save your daughter from the truth?

400
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:26,721
I mean, come on. You saw as well as I did.

401
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,907
- That cat was dead, Jud.
- I never said he wasn't.

402
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:32,574
- Well, then how do you explain it?
- I don't.

403
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,377
Nobody can.

404
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,179
You're gonna have to do
better than that, Jud.

405
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,089
There are places in this world

406
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,340
that are older than either of us.

407
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,423
<i>Places that a rational
doctor brain like yours</i>

408
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,007
<i>will never understand.</i>

409
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:54,728
<i>Nobody knows what that place is,
what happens in that stony ground.</i>

410
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:58,975
<i>But the soil of a man's heart
is stonier, Louis.</i>

411
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,692
<i>What we did last night,</i>

412
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,491
<i>we did for Ellie.</i>

413
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,237
<i>But that's your cat now.</i>

414
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,707
"Bull presumed dead found on main street."

415
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,803
"Timothy Baterman..."

416
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,973
"Cadaver disappearance?"

417
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,484
What the fuck?

418
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:05,253
Where did you take me, Jud?

419
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,478
Church, you're so stinky.

420
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,730
What'd you do out there?

421
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:26,236
Hang on, Church, there's something...

422
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,732
Something gross in your fur.

423
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,288
There we go.

424
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,123
Give me a look.

425
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,296
Okay. Does that feel okay?

426
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,544
Yeah?

427
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:49,218
I want to go back to our old house.

428
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:55,054
Well, Mommy and I,
we moved up here to slow down,

429
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:58,853
so that we could
spend more time with you, so that...

430
00:39:58,938 --> 00:39:59,974
Lift up.

431
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:04,232
So that Daddy could be around,
he could tuck you into bed more,

432
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,811
make sure you're all safe and sound.

433
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,488
Give you a little tickle
before he says good night.

434
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:10,781
Okay? Come on.

435
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,233
Okay, honey.

436
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,861
I promise, okay, just like your arm,
it's gonna get better.

437
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,446
All right? Trust me?

438
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,240
Good night.

439
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,707
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

440
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:25,417
Close the door all the way.
I don't want Church coming in anymore.

441
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,665
Okay.

442
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,425
I love you.

443
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,432
<i>How is she?</i>

444
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:39,056
She's good. Poor little thing.

445
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,681
What about Church?

446
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,648
I don't know. Must've been the accident.

447
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,444
I'll take him to the vet tomorrow.

448
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:55,905
What about you?

449
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,117
I'm good.

450
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:03,502
But...

451
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,205
Come here.

452
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:14,174
It's been hard, the past few months.

453
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,752
What? Oh, Jesus!

454
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,507
Louis, it's still alive.

455
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,220
Damn it!

456
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:59,173
Jesus Christ.

457
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,472
Church?

458
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,681
Church?

459
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,644
Come out of there, buddy.

460
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,535
Church...

461
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:50,607
<i>Your destruction</i>

462
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:56,106
<i>and the destruction of all you love
is very near, Doctor.</i>

463
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:06,485
Rach, what happened? You okay?

464
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,784
I don't want to talk about it.

465
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:16,120
- Is it the bird?
- No, it's not the bird.

466
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:20,632
I think it's a mistake that we moved here.

467
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,879
It doesn't feel right, Louis.

468
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,955
You remember why we moved here
in the first place?

469
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,220
No, I know.

470
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,769
I mean, look, we have
Ellie's birthday coming up.

471
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:42,216
Why don't we do something special, hey?

472
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,651
We could throw a party.

473
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:48,736
We could invite some of our friends
from Boston up, all right?

474
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,661
Invite your parents, even.

475
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:56,042
Okay?

476
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:02,590
We can turn this around.
We can. We can turn this around.

477
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:16,263
These are looking good, El.

478
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:28,618
El, what is this?

479
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,789
I don't know. Gage drew that.

480
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,175
Gage?

481
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,139
Come on, Daddy's got you.
Daddy's got you.

482
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,606
I was 11 when I lost Biff.

483
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:03,777
He'd run over some barbed wire
and the cuts got infected.

484
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,397
Daddy had to put him down
out of mercy.

485
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,824
- Your dad took you up there.
- No, no.

486
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,623
It was an old fella
named Stanny Bouchard.

487
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:18,041
He told me about it.

488
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,747
The Wendigo.

489
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,628
You heard a lot about that

490
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,177
all over the north country
back in the old days.

491
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:31,130
It was a myth

492
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:35,721
passed down from the local tribes
up this way.

493
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:39,346
But to them,
it wasn't just some campfire story.

494
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,602
They believed it. They feared it.

495
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,394
Saw these on the trees up there.

496
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:47,024
Yeah, they're warnings.

497
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:50,153
The local tribes carved them
before they fled.

498
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:51,576
Fled?

499
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,743
Yeah, they knew the power of that place.

500
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,780
They felt its pull.

501
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:03,295
They came to believe that
those woods belonged to something else.

502
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,165
That the ground was bad.

503
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,296
Sour.

504
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,761
The ground is sour.

505
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:14,224
Yeah.

506
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:18,594
So, they moved on.
But not before they built that deadfall.

507
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:23,523
They built it to keep people out.
But it didn't keep people out.

508
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:26,602
The Wendigo

509
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:32,441
may just be some crazy folktale,
but there is something up there.

510
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:36,403
Something that brings things back.

511
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,658
So, what happened to your dog, Jud?

512
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,996
He came back.

513
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:47,965
Just like Stanny B. said he would.
But he was changed.

514
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:52,427
It was when he went after my mother
that my daddy put him down.

515
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:54,888
For the second time.

516
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:03,431
I thought it would be different
with Ellie's cat.

517
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:07,438
I mean, Biff had a mean streak
to begin with.

518
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,065
But Church, well...

519
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,148
- Was a nice cat...
- He tried to hurt Gage.

520
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,444
I'm so sorry, Louis. I am.

521
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,324
Once you feel the power of that place,

522
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:26,745
you make up the sweetest-smelling reasons
to go back.

523
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:30,378
But I was wrong.

524
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:34,590
Sometimes dead is better.

525
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:41,853
Come on, hold still.

526
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,327
Hold still, you're just gonna go to sleep.

527
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:47,732
Damn it, Church. Come on, just...

528
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,356
God damn it.

529
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,292
Come on.

530
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,091
Hey.

531
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,012
Good luck.

532
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:44,580
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

533
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:49,370
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

534
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:54,709
<i>Happy birthday, dear Ellie</i>

535
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:58,261
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

536
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:04,680
Good job, Ellie.

537
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,228
I want a piece right from the end.

538
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:11,061
...big St. Bernard.

539
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,485
He got rabies.
He killed about four people.

540
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,277
Hey.

541
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,742
You still thinking about Church?

542
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,457
It's my fault he left.

543
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:34,164
I told him to get out of my room.

544
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:35,669
No, honey, no.

545
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,542
Church loves you.

546
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:42,385
Maybe this might help cheer you up.

547
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:49,388
Give him a squeeze.

548
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:54,693
- I love him, Daddy.
- You do? Yeah?

549
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,019
And I love you.

550
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:59,572
Now go and have a great birthday, okay?

551
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,571
<i>Six...</i>

552
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:08,157
Seven, eight, nine, 10!

553
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,332
I'm a monster!

554
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:17,921
Where is everyone?
Where are you guys? Come on.

555
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:26,307
Come on! Where is that... Come on!

556
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,189
Church?

557
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,234
Church!

558
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,710
Church. You came home.

559
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:06,139
All right, you're it.

560
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,185
Where's...

561
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:13,472
Gage!

562
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:23,074
Church!

563
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:45,934
I keep thinking

564
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:49,362
that I'm gonna hear her
coming up the stairs,

565
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,941
like she's coming home from school.

566
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,827
I can't be here right now.

567
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,382
I'm just gonna wrap up a few things.

568
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,339
Come soon.

569
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,350
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

570
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:25,728
Be a good boy, okay, buddy?
Take care of Mommy for me.

571
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,149
I'll see you in a couple days.

572
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,916
I saw Rachel and Gage
leaving a little while ago.

573
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,380
Boston.

574
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:34,584
Parents' house.

575
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,014
So it's just you over there?

576
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:43,934
Yep.

577
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:45,724
I'll drive down in a few days.

578
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:48,690
I got to finish a few things
at the clinic first.

579
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:52,651
That's good.

580
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:55,776
It's a tough time
for you folks to be apart.

581
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:58,699
Yeah.

582
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:28,688
You know, when you came walking
over here, it was a relief.

583
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,191
I was gonna come to see you.

584
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,239
I should never have shown you that place.

585
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:41,659
But you did.

586
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:46,246
I know what you're
thinking of doing, Louis,

587
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:49,917
but she won't come back the same.

588
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:54,835
I'm so goddamn sorry I did this.

589
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:59,552
Ellie is the first person
to touch my heart in a long time.

590
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:02,346
I didn't want her to be so sad.

591
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:06,597
It's that goddamn place.
It feeds on your grief,

592
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,928
gets into your mind.

593
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:11,816
Damn it.

594
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:17,562
I need to close my eyes for a minute.

595
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:37,964
<i>Hey.</i>

596
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:40,338
<i>Thought you'd be in bed.</i>

597
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:44,012
I was waiting to hear from you.
I called earlier.

598
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,467
<i>Yeah, I know, I saw that. I was...</i>

599
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:51,054
I went over to Jud's.
Had a couple of drinks.

600
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:55,559
<i>Can you just come be with us?</i>

601
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:01,397
Gage needs you and I'm...

602
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,954
I'm really wiped out, honey.

603
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,702
Is it okay if we talk tomorrow?

604
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:15,957
Okay.

605
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:18,714
I love you.

606
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:20,796
I love you, too.

607
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:22,502
Goodbye.

608
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:47,861
Fuck.

609
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,475
<i>Louis, stop.</i>

610
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,151
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

611
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,696
<i>You have to let her go.</i>

612
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:49,239
But I can fix this.

613
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:51,992
<i>Pascow!</i>

614
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:54,991
Pascow! Pascow!

615
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,491
Come here. No, it's okay.

616
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:01,828
It's okay. It's okay.

617
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,422
<i>Go home.</i>

618
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,750
Pascow says go home.

619
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,710
Mommy, go home!

620
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:13,218
There's nothing there.

621
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,567
There's nothing there.

622
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:46,331
Daddy's almost there, almost there.

623
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,528
I'm sorry.

624
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:16,748
Daddy?

625
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:19,755
Where am I?

626
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:24,259
My... My little girl.

627
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:27,880
Come here.

628
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:29,423
You're home!

629
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:35,062
Home.

630
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:35,117
What is it?

631
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,491
Just a tangle.

632
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:54,057
Where's Mommy and Gage?

633
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:58,433
They went down to Grandma and Grandpa's.

634
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:01,474
Are they coming back?

635
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:05,779
Yeah.

636
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:12,325
I remember my birthday party.

637
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:16,204
Church was out on the road.

638
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,581
I was so happy he came home.

639
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:27,295
There was a truck.

640
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:30,173
Then everything went black.

641
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:32,929
Well, it's okay now.

642
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,178
Now you're back.

643
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:40,763
Back from where?

644
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:51,360
It's time to go to bed, okay?
Turn the light off.

645
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:54,409
I'm dead, aren't I?

646
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,949
No, honey. No.

647
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:00,040
You're here.

648
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:04,202
Will you stay with me?

649
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:07,043
Of course.

650
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:24,644
I can hear the woods.

651
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:29,395
The windows are closed, sweetheart.

652
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:31,571
Not like that.

653
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:35,617
Inside.

654
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:44,835
Does Mommy know about me?

655
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:46,412
Please, El...

656
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:50,340
Close your eyes, okay?

657
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,342
It's gonna be okay.

658
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,182
Love you, Daddy.

659
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,015
Love you too, El.

660
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:40,347
El?

661
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:16,634
Ellie, careful.

662
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:22,804
Just stop it. Stop it.
Stop. Ellie, stop it.

663
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:25,267
Stop it!

664
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:36,730
Why'd you put the dress back on?

665
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:48,541
What are you gonna tell her?

666
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:59,090
Something happened last night. I...

667
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:01,580
Gage was having a nightmare,
or I thought it was a nightmare,

668
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,303
and he just started saying
that boy's name who died.

669
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:06,601
I'm freaking out,
and Gage is freaking out,

670
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:08,303
and I... I just need to talk to you.

671
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,013
Just please call me back.

672
01:16:11,025 --> 01:16:12,391
<i>It's 4:00 p.m. on the dot</i>

673
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:14,522
<i>and we're coming
to you with a traffic update.</i>

674
01:16:14,612 --> 01:16:15,898
<i>Expect major delays.</i>

675
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:17,820
<i>Traffic on the I-95
is backed-up for miles.</i>

676
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:19,990
We're gonna be okay, okay?

677
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:21,783
- Okay?
- Mama.

678
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:24,236
- Mama.
<i>- Call Jud.</i>

679
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:29,246
<i>So far, no fatalities,
but two passengers have been airlifted...</i>

680
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:31,042
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Jud, hi, it's Rachel.

681
01:16:31,796 --> 01:16:33,583
Rachel. You...

682
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:36,335
You down at your folks' place?

683
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,212
<i>Yeah, I'm on my way back.
Something's wrong.</i>

684
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:39,964
<i>I'm really worried about Louis right now.</i>

685
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:41,795
- Louis?
- Can you just go over there

686
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:43,425
and check on him, please?

687
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:46,224
<i>I've been calling him
all morning, and I don't know...</i>

688
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:50,224
What... He... He's not answering?

689
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:53,057
No. And I've called him so many times.

690
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:57,315
<i>- Well, I'll go over there and check.</i>
- Okay. Thank you, Jud.

691
01:16:57,404 --> 01:16:59,020
<i>I should be there soon, okay?</i>

692
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:01,607
Yeah, I'll see you then, Rachel.

693
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:13,626
Louis? You in there?

694
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:19,044
Hey, Jud.

695
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,210
How's your head today?

696
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:25,927
It's banging like a drum, Jud.

697
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:36,896
I don't remember you leaving last night.

698
01:17:37,236 --> 01:17:38,727
Yeah, you passed out.

699
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:44,778
Listen, I got to...
I got to get back inside. I'm...

700
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:48,616
I've been waiting for Rachel
to call all morning

701
01:17:48,706 --> 01:17:50,914
and I don't want to miss it. So...

702
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:53,501
Okay?

703
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,589
If you've done something, Louis,

704
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:02,834
it's not too late to undo it.

705
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:11,642
You don't have to worry about me, Jud.

706
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:13,599
I'm fine.

707
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:16,682
Really.

708
01:18:16,775 --> 01:18:18,357
If that's all, I'm gonna...

709
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,652
I'm gonna go.

710
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:09,552
I know you're up here!

711
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,487
- Hello, Jud.
- Stop it, Ellie.

712
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:57,702
Now, just slow down.

713
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:01,122
Your sweet Norma.

714
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:03,791
She's burning down in hell
for what you did to her.

715
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:06,711
I saw her there, Jud. I saw her.

716
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:09,084
Shut up! You don't know
anything about her!

717
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:14,426
Did you miss me, Judson?

718
01:22:14,513 --> 01:22:16,470
That's not my Norma!

719
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:22,686
Ellie's hurting. You did this to her!

720
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:24,854
It's not you. It's not you!

721
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:27,182
You told Louis about that place.

722
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:29,566
And now we're suffering

723
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:31,485
eternally.

724
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:38,409
But we're here now to bring you back

725
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:40,945
so you can suffer with us.

726
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:44,324
Just you come and fucking try!

727
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:53,754
El?

728
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:05,186
Shit.

729
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:10,274
Rachel.

730
01:23:10,777 --> 01:23:12,359
What are you...

731
01:23:12,446 --> 01:23:14,483
You're okay. Thank God you're okay!

732
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:16,610
I was so worried, and I was calling

733
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:19,238
and you wouldn't pick up and...
Gage was having these nightmares

734
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:22,162
and he was saying the name
of that boy that died.

735
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:25,703
I'm here right now.
I just need you and no one else.

736
01:23:25,792 --> 01:23:27,033
Just you and me and Gage,

737
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:29,335
- we can get through this.
- It's okay. It's okay.

738
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:31,003
Come on, honey, it's okay.

739
01:23:32,049 --> 01:23:34,382
- Look at you, hey? You're Daddy's boy.
- Daddy.

740
01:23:34,468 --> 01:23:36,334
Have you gotten bigger? Hey?
Tell me, come on.

741
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:38,340
Have you gotten bigger? I think he has.

742
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:40,217
I think he's gotten a lot bigger.

743
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:42,139
You smell so good!

744
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:44,809
You smell so good! Come to Daddy.

745
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:48,388
Louis, what's going on?

746
01:23:52,653 --> 01:23:54,861
I needed more time with her.

747
01:23:55,656 --> 01:23:58,069
Come here. Come here.

748
01:23:59,493 --> 01:24:00,609
Honey.

749
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:04,286
I wasn't ready to say goodbye to her.

750
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:06,619
You're scaring me.

751
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:09,417
Just tell me what you're talking about.

752
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:11,165
It was my fault she died, Rach.

753
01:24:11,255 --> 01:24:12,917
I had to bring her back.

754
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:18,885
Ellie-phant.

755
01:24:28,438 --> 01:24:30,304
The Great and Terrible.

756
01:24:34,027 --> 01:24:36,861
There's a place, Rach, deep in the woods

757
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:40,023
beyond the pet cemetery.

758
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:46,537
It brings things back.

759
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:51,159
Aren't you happy, Mommy?

760
01:25:04,308 --> 01:25:05,719
Hug your daughter, Rach.

761
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:08,593
Hug your daughter.

762
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:20,063
I need to put Gage to bed.

763
01:25:22,576 --> 01:25:23,576
Rachel!

764
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:25,868
She doesn't want me here.

765
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:29,117
No, no, no, no, no. Mommy just needs time.

766
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:33,580
It's okay. I don't want her here, either.

767
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:36,003
We're okay. Okay, yes.

768
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:38,001
Here you go. Here you go, sweetie.

769
01:25:38,091 --> 01:25:39,502
Rachel.

770
01:25:39,593 --> 01:25:41,505
Rachel, open up. Please.

771
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:43,711
Just let me explain.

772
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:47,390
I know. Let me explain.

773
01:25:52,773 --> 01:25:54,935
What is she? What is...

774
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:56,808
That is Ellie out there.

775
01:25:56,902 --> 01:26:00,395
No. No, we buried her.
We put her in the ground.

776
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:04,028
She's been given back to us.
We have a second chance.

777
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:06,074
It doesn't work that way, Louis.

778
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:07,764
Yes, it does.
There's a place in the woods.

779
01:26:07,788 --> 01:26:09,188
That place I was telling you about.

780
01:26:09,247 --> 01:26:11,447
I couldn't understand it
until I buried Church up there.

781
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,537
That cat was dead
until I buried him in the ground

782
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:14,993
and it brought him back.

783
01:26:16,755 --> 01:26:19,042
He wasn't the same after that.

784
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:21,549
You saw her.

785
01:26:22,052 --> 01:26:24,009
You touched her. That is our daughter.

786
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:25,632
You dug her up?

787
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:27,384
That is our daughter down there, honey.

788
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:29,007
Please, okay?

789
01:26:30,894 --> 01:26:32,385
I did what I think was right.

790
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:35,222
Let God take his own fucking kid!

791
01:26:48,578 --> 01:26:50,319
- Ellie?
- You're okay.

792
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:52,614
Ellie!

793
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:55,997
Ellie, baby, Mommy and Daddy were just...

794
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:00,045
Shit.

795
01:27:11,268 --> 01:27:12,304
Mama.

796
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:15,516
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

797
01:27:15,605 --> 01:27:17,597
Mommy's okay. Mommy's...

798
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:28,282
No. No, no, no. No, no, no...

799
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:31,162
No.

800
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:38,595
Rachel.

801
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:47,020
Now you'll never get out of bed again.

802
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:01,538
No! No!

803
01:29:02,212 --> 01:29:04,499
Stop struggling, you useless cow.

804
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:07,213
Ellie?

805
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:15,093
Shit.

806
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:44,956
Jud!

807
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:53,381
Oh, my God.

808
01:29:53,889 --> 01:29:56,632
Oh, my God. No, Jud.

809
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,267
God damn it!

810
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:36,925
Louis! Take the baby!

811
01:30:37,015 --> 01:30:39,007
- Louis!
- Rachel!

812
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:40,966
Take the baby! Ellie's trying to kill me!

813
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:42,496
- Come on, I got him. Jump!
- Take the baby!

814
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:45,183
Let him go! Come on, Daddy's got you.

815
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:46,434
Come on.

816
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:55,318
Okay. Okay, Gage.

817
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:57,149
Daddy needs you to stay in the car, okay?

818
01:30:57,243 --> 01:30:58,575
Don't open the door for anyone.

819
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:00,244
Listen to me, Gage, not even for Ellie.

820
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:07,751
You let me die in that road.
You did nothing.

821
01:31:07,837 --> 01:31:09,874
Just like you did with your sister.

822
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:12,923
I was scared.

823
01:31:23,853 --> 01:31:25,344
You're a liar.

824
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:28,230
You prayed your sister would die.

825
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:30,436
I did.

826
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:36,189
Remember when Daddy said
there was nothing after this?

827
01:31:36,282 --> 01:31:37,864
Well, he was wrong.

828
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:41,193
But it's not heaven.

829
01:31:41,705 --> 01:31:44,368
And you're going there soon, Mommy.

830
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:48,626
Don't call me "Mommy."

831
01:31:52,298 --> 01:31:54,415
You're not my daughter.

832
01:31:57,554 --> 01:31:58,920
Ellie's dead.

833
01:32:00,098 --> 01:32:01,805
Then go be with her!

834
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:05,596
Rachel!

835
01:32:10,025 --> 01:32:12,392
Oh, God, Rach. I got Gage.

836
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:15,777
Don't bury me in that place.

837
01:32:15,864 --> 01:32:16,864
What?

838
01:33:12,212 --> 01:33:14,078
Fuck. Shit.

839
01:33:29,813 --> 01:33:31,179
Rachel!

840
01:33:33,149 --> 01:33:34,981
You're too late.

841
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:39,479
Where's Mommy?

842
01:33:40,156 --> 01:33:43,115
Mommy's already feasting on dirt.

843
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:46,823
What have you done, El? Come on.

844
01:33:48,915 --> 01:33:51,032
You started this, Daddy.

845
01:33:53,086 --> 01:33:55,078
When you moved us here.

846
01:33:57,465 --> 01:33:59,627
When you buried Church.

847
01:33:59,717 --> 01:34:01,253
When you buried me!

848
01:34:19,195 --> 01:34:20,982
Stop fighting, Daddy.

849
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:22,734
It will be better this way.

850
01:34:44,387 --> 01:34:47,175
You're dead! You're dead!

851
01:34:55,899 --> 01:34:57,982
You're dead!

852
01:34:59,903 --> 01:35:01,644
Please, please, just stop.

853
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:08,863
Get off!

854
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:12,746
I thought we could be a family.
I wanted to be a family.

855
01:35:12,832 --> 01:35:14,198
But we can't.

856
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:16,830
But we can, Daddy. We can.

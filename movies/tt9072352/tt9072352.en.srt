2
00:03:48,154 --> 00:03:52,158
Kay. Hi, it's Mike Adler
here from Creswick Police.

3
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:54,911
Look, I'm just calling about your mum.

4
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,664
The neighbours haven't seen her
in a few days.

5
00:03:57,873 --> 00:04:00,834
I've been by her house,
without much luck.

6
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:03,712
And I was just wondering
if you'd heard from her.

7
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,841
Could you give me a call
when you can? Thanks.

8
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,369
Gran?

9
00:04:58,891 --> 00:05:00,351
Gran?

10
00:05:22,457 --> 00:05:23,874
Gran?

11
00:05:35,928 --> 00:05:37,346
Mum?

12
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:43,352
Gran?

13
00:05:47,982 --> 00:05:49,524
Wait.

14
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:51,694
Just…wait out here.

15
00:06:22,057 --> 00:06:23,475
Mum?

16
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,749
You should set up
in my old room.

17
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,551
What?

18
00:06:59,636 --> 00:07:01,220
- Kay, what?
- Nothing.

19
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,639
Call straightaway if she…

20
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:04,266
- Yeah, I will.
- OK.

21
00:07:14,526 --> 00:07:15,944
Does your mum
still drive?

22
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:19,531
Sometimes. But her car's
still at the house.

23
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:23,535
- And... any medical problems?
- No.

24
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,662
She's in her 80s.
She forgets things.

25
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,082
She managed to flood the house
last Christmas.

26
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,011
And when was the last time
you spoke to her?

27
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,669
It's been a while.

28
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,755
Could... you be more specific?

29
00:07:35,964 --> 00:07:37,591
Um…

30
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:39,008
Well, in situations like this,

31
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:41,385
we... we need to come up
with a time line.

32
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:45,223
When Alex called last night,
he said he hadn't noticed

33
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:48,267
your mum leave the house
for a few days, maybe a week.

34
00:07:48,476 --> 00:07:49,685
So, if we can figure out

35
00:07:49,894 --> 00:07:51,855
who the last person was
to speak to her, we can...

36
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,916
- Yeah, of course, yeah.
- ..Figure out exactly who…

37
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,233
Sorry. Um…

38
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,485
It's been a few weeks.

39
00:07:58,527 --> 00:08:00,279
Work's been crazy.
You know how it is.

40
00:08:06,494 --> 00:08:08,454
And what did you talk about?

41
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:12,000
Nothing, really. Normal stuff.

42
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,170
She didn't mention anything
about a holiday,

43
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:18,020
appointment out of town,
visiting friends?

44
00:08:18,172 --> 00:08:20,633
No. Nothing like that.

45
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:23,886
We'll organise
the overall search strategy.

46
00:08:24,095 --> 00:08:25,346
OK.

47
00:08:25,554 --> 00:08:27,806
- Did you bring a recent photo?
- Yeah.

48
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:40,110
This was taken late last year.

49
00:09:02,758 --> 00:09:04,342
Jesus Christ.

50
00:09:11,475 --> 00:09:13,561
Great...

51
00:11:19,601 --> 00:11:21,813
She's been putting food out
for Chester.

52
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,075
Is your boss OK
with you taking time off?

53
00:11:34,283 --> 00:11:35,701
Yeah.

54
00:11:38,787 --> 00:11:40,206
Well, no.

55
00:11:41,873 --> 00:11:43,834
I stopped working at the gallery.

56
00:11:44,043 --> 00:11:45,461
Since when?

57
00:11:46,587 --> 00:11:48,005
A while.

58
00:11:50,882 --> 00:11:52,343
What are you doing for money?

59
00:11:52,551 --> 00:11:55,429
I've got some decent shifts
back at the bar.

60
00:11:57,306 --> 00:11:59,183
Still planning on going back to uni?

61
00:11:59,391 --> 00:12:00,392
I don't know, Kay.

62
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:02,912
So, what, you're just gonna work in a bar
for the rest of your life?

63
00:12:02,936 --> 00:12:04,688
Yeah, maybe.

64
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,489
I'm glad you're here.

65
00:12:15,324 --> 00:12:17,868
I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to be doing.

66
00:12:23,248 --> 00:12:25,083
I think you're doing it.

67
00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:51,652
Edna!

68
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:55,697
Edna?!

69
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:04,497
- Edna!
- Mum!

70
00:13:06,457 --> 00:13:07,876
Edna?!

71
00:13:10,545 --> 00:13:12,172
Edna?!

72
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,215
Mum?!

73
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,139
Edna?!

74
00:13:26,144 --> 00:13:27,562
Edna?!

75
00:13:28,813 --> 00:13:31,149
Edna?!

76
00:13:32,317 --> 00:13:34,444
We'll regroup
first thing tomorrow.

77
00:13:34,652 --> 00:13:37,613
We should check
the trail by St Georges Lake.

78
00:13:37,822 --> 00:13:40,241
Gran used to take me there
all the time when I was a kid.

79
00:14:35,838 --> 00:14:37,422
Gran?

80
00:14:41,677 --> 00:14:43,095
Jamie?

81
00:14:45,222 --> 00:14:47,266
Hi, Sam.

82
00:14:47,474 --> 00:14:49,268
What are you up to?

83
00:14:51,645 --> 00:14:53,147
Patrolling.

84
00:14:53,355 --> 00:14:55,315
OK.

85
00:14:58,152 --> 00:15:00,154
Did you find her yet?

86
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:03,991
No, not yet.

87
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,412
When was the last time you saw her?

88
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,455
Not for ages.

89
00:15:10,664 --> 00:15:13,750
Dad doesn't like me
coming over anymore.

90
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:16,336
Why's that?

91
00:15:21,883 --> 00:15:23,718
Smells weird.

92
00:15:25,095 --> 00:15:27,181
Can I have a go?

93
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:28,640
I'm allowed.

94
00:15:30,225 --> 00:15:32,101
You're 18!

95
00:15:32,311 --> 00:15:33,853
When did that happen?

96
00:15:36,856 --> 00:15:38,275
Oh!

97
00:15:40,109 --> 00:15:42,237
Thanks, Jamie.
I really needed that.

98
00:15:42,446 --> 00:15:44,030
I might go inside. It's freezing.

99
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:47,326
Do you want to come in?
Make you a Milo?

100
00:15:50,954 --> 00:15:52,246
Nah.

101
00:15:53,915 --> 00:15:55,334
That's OK.

102
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,883
It's D after that bit, not E.

103
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:46,759
How do you know?

104
00:16:46,968 --> 00:16:49,470
Gran taught me.

105
00:16:49,678 --> 00:16:51,347
Of course she did.

106
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:56,648
I could never get the curl
of the fingers right.

107
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:59,063
I think she gave up on me
at a certain point.

108
00:17:00,481 --> 00:17:02,400
Are these locks new too?

109
00:17:06,862 --> 00:17:08,697
I think she was scared.

110
00:17:08,906 --> 00:17:10,991
Scared? Of what?

111
00:17:14,077 --> 00:17:15,996
She called me a few weeks ago.

112
00:17:16,205 --> 00:17:18,832
She thought someone
was coming into the house.

113
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,543
What? Why?

114
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:23,337
Doors were left open,
the lights were left on,

115
00:17:23,546 --> 00:17:25,381
she... the...

116
00:17:26,382 --> 00:17:27,758
...armchair had shifted.

117
00:17:27,966 --> 00:17:29,385
Well…

118
00:17:30,469 --> 00:17:31,845
...did you tell the police?

119
00:17:32,054 --> 00:17:33,472
She forgets things.

120
00:17:33,681 --> 00:17:35,121
You know what she's like.
It was her.

121
00:17:35,223 --> 00:17:37,076
Well, why didn't you call me?
I could have driven up here.

122
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,602
I mean, what if she was…

123
00:18:40,497 --> 00:18:41,957
What was that?

124
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,043
Kay?

125
00:18:45,252 --> 00:18:46,961
Don't know.

126
00:19:22,372 --> 00:19:23,831
What is that?

127
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:22,198
What... what's wrong?

128
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:23,825
Nothing.

129
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:27,203
Go to sleep.

130
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,630
Mum?

131
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,308
Where...?

132
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,143
Where have you been?

133
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,032
Tea?

134
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,868
Are you OK?

135
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,579
One sugar, right?

136
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,207
- Gran!
- Oh!

137
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,964
About half an hour ago.

138
00:24:26,172 --> 00:24:28,383
No, she's... she's not hurt.

139
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:32,346
She's... As far as I can tell.
She won't tell me anything.

140
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,308
Whenever I ask, she just changes the subject,
acts like nothing happened.

141
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,353
Like she hasn't been gone
for three days.

142
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,398
Yeah, I don't wanna push her.
I just... I just hope she's OK.

143
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,527
Yeah. Thanks, Mike.
Yeah, I will. Bye.

144
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,537
- Any chest pain?
- No.

145
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,414
Breathlessness? Dysuria?

146
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,166
Dysuria?

147
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,752
Does it hurt to pee?

148
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,962
Oh. No.

149
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,588
Neither of those things.

150
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,592
Would you mind taking a slow walk
to your daughter and back?

151
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:19,350
- Edna, when's your birthday?
- April 10th.

152
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:21,227
And how about your granddaughter's?

153
00:25:21,435 --> 00:25:22,854
March 3rd.

154
00:25:24,772 --> 00:25:25,940
Good.

155
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,400
See?

156
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:29,360
This one worries about me.

157
00:25:29,568 --> 00:25:31,654
- May I?
- Mm-hm.

158
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,950
Do you know how you got this bruise?

159
00:25:39,245 --> 00:25:41,956
Oh... I must have knocked it.

160
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,416
Clumsy.

161
00:25:43,624 --> 00:25:45,334
Just to be safe, I'm going to recommend

162
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,521
that you not be by yourself
for the next couple of weeks.

163
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:50,464
- Is that really necessary?
- Sorry, Edna. I insist.

164
00:25:50,673 --> 00:25:52,925
House arrest it is, then.

165
00:26:16,532 --> 00:26:18,867
Well, tell them
it's a family emergency.

166
00:26:21,078 --> 00:26:23,330
Yeah, I know that,
but he's perfectly capable.

167
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:27,876
Uh-huh. A week, maybe two.

168
00:26:28,085 --> 00:26:29,712
Well, what do you expect...?

169
00:26:30,796 --> 00:26:33,298
Yeah. Fine. Fine, email it.

170
00:26:38,804 --> 00:26:40,430
I've gotta go, Luce.

171
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,241
What's that?

172
00:27:06,206 --> 00:27:08,458
Do you know where you were, Mum?

173
00:27:09,918 --> 00:27:12,295
- Where?
- No, I'm asking you.

174
00:27:14,297 --> 00:27:17,217
I suppose I went out.

175
00:27:17,425 --> 00:27:18,801
Out where?

176
00:27:19,011 --> 00:27:21,972
If I'd known you'd call the police,
I would have stayed home.

177
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,391
There's blood on your nightgown.

178
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,979
Do you need help?

179
00:27:30,647 --> 00:27:31,898
With what?

180
00:27:32,107 --> 00:27:34,734
There are Post-it notes
everywhere, Mum.

181
00:27:36,403 --> 00:27:39,447
It's my house.
I can decorate it however I want.

182
00:27:39,656 --> 00:27:41,908
Just tell me what happened!

183
00:27:42,117 --> 00:27:43,868
Look, can we just
take it easy today?

184
00:27:44,076 --> 00:27:46,078
Gran must be exhausted.

185
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:33,668
Gran?

186
00:28:36,921 --> 00:28:38,089
Oh.

187
00:28:39,674 --> 00:28:41,092
Got your tea.

188
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,969
What service!

189
00:28:44,929 --> 00:28:46,848
Sorry about Mum.

190
00:28:47,056 --> 00:28:48,682
She was worried about you.

191
00:28:48,891 --> 00:28:50,601
We all were.

192
00:29:02,363 --> 00:29:04,198
I had to stop wearing it.

193
00:29:04,406 --> 00:29:07,826
They say you shrink with age,
but my fingers just keep getting fatter.

194
00:29:09,536 --> 00:29:10,955
It's lovely.

195
00:29:11,163 --> 00:29:13,040
It's yours.

196
00:29:15,542 --> 00:29:16,960
Gran, I can't take this.

197
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:18,837
You might need it one day.

198
00:29:19,921 --> 00:29:22,091
And your mother's already had a go.

199
00:29:32,726 --> 00:29:34,353
Wow, you cleaned up.

200
00:29:39,941 --> 00:29:41,902
Please leave it. I've got a system.

201
00:29:44,195 --> 00:29:46,740
- What are you doing?
- Work.

202
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:59,545
Look at this.

203
00:30:08,762 --> 00:30:10,806
Guess I was.

204
00:30:12,432 --> 00:30:14,309
Wow.

205
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:18,188
He could draw.

206
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:20,691
Yeah.

207
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:23,234
God, I haven't seen this for years.

208
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:31,242
Wait. What's this?

209
00:30:31,451 --> 00:30:32,451
Oh...

210
00:30:32,535 --> 00:30:35,914
Oh, that was on the property
when your grandparents inherited it.

211
00:30:36,915 --> 00:30:39,417
My great-grandfather lived there.

212
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:43,004
- By himself?
- Yeah. There were all these stories.

213
00:30:43,213 --> 00:30:45,298
Apparently, his mind
wasn't all there in the end,

214
00:30:45,506 --> 00:30:47,467
and nobody knew how bad it was.

215
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:51,762
I don't think he was cared for
like he should have been, you know?

216
00:30:51,972 --> 00:30:53,556
Mm.

217
00:30:53,764 --> 00:30:55,475
I was happy to see it go.

218
00:30:55,683 --> 00:30:58,353
Mum used to threaten to lock me in it
when I was being a brat.

219
00:31:03,274 --> 00:31:05,860
Is that the same window as
the one on the door downstairs?

220
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:07,653
Yeah.

221
00:31:07,862 --> 00:31:10,323
Yeah, when they tore it down,
they saved some of the windows

222
00:31:10,531 --> 00:31:13,284
and used them to build into this place.

223
00:31:16,704 --> 00:31:18,745
Can you keep an eye on her
for a few hours tomorrow?

224
00:31:18,914 --> 00:31:21,251
- Where are you going?
- Back to Melbourne.

225
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:24,587
- You going back to work?
- No. I...

226
00:31:24,795 --> 00:31:27,382
I've booked a tour
of a retirement place.

227
00:31:30,385 --> 00:31:32,011
You can't put Gran in a home.

228
00:31:32,219 --> 00:31:34,514
You heard her before.
She doesn't know where she was.

229
00:31:34,722 --> 00:31:36,056
I don't think she can remember.

230
00:31:36,265 --> 00:31:38,308
That's not what I heard.

231
00:31:40,895 --> 00:31:42,772
She can't live on her own anymore, Sam.

232
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,150
- Well, why can't she move in with you?
- Because that's not practical.

233
00:31:46,358 --> 00:31:47,753
There's plenty of room at your place.

234
00:31:47,777 --> 00:31:49,987
No, it's not about room.
She has to be watched.

235
00:31:50,195 --> 00:31:52,072
Well, isn't that how it works?

236
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:55,200
Your mum changes your nappies
and then you change hers?

237
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:06,879
You need to be on the same side
as me for this.

238
00:32:09,048 --> 00:32:10,716
Does Gran even get a say?

239
00:32:14,678 --> 00:32:16,430
This is what's best for Gran.

240
00:33:01,015 --> 00:33:03,017
What noise?

241
00:33:03,227 --> 00:33:05,979
No. I didn't hear any noise.

242
00:33:06,188 --> 00:33:09,065
I told you. I told you it's nothing.

243
00:33:10,275 --> 00:33:11,693
There's no-one.

244
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:13,737
You're scaring me.

245
00:33:13,945 --> 00:33:15,364
Mum?

246
00:33:27,876 --> 00:33:29,461
Are you alright?

247
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:34,508
Are you leaving?

248
00:33:35,675 --> 00:33:37,093
No, Mum.

249
00:33:42,098 --> 00:33:43,516
That's good.

250
00:33:49,814 --> 00:33:51,900
Will you be alright now?

251
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,452
Mum?

252
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,506
Mum, what is it?

253
00:34:23,347 --> 00:34:24,848
It's here.

254
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,477
Under the bed.

255
00:34:30,104 --> 00:34:32,648
No, there's nothing under the bed, Mum.

256
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:35,901
Are you sure?

257
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,528
Yes.

258
00:34:43,117 --> 00:34:44,827
Will you check for me?

259
00:34:49,873 --> 00:34:51,209
Please.

260
00:34:56,046 --> 00:34:57,590
See? Nothing.

261
00:34:58,841 --> 00:35:00,551
You didn't look.

262
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,089
Ow!

263
00:35:39,297 --> 00:35:40,799
Shit! Oh!

264
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,260
Oh!

265
00:35:44,427 --> 00:35:46,179
You did that on purpose.

266
00:35:46,388 --> 00:35:48,431
- Did what?
- You dropped that on purpose!

267
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,809
- Why would I do that?
- I don't know.

268
00:35:51,018 --> 00:35:53,645
- Did you hit your head?
- Yes! Yes! Yes.

269
00:36:19,796 --> 00:36:23,007
Now, you mentioned your mother
has some cognitive impairment?

270
00:36:24,509 --> 00:36:26,344
Yeah,
I... I don't really know.

271
00:36:26,553 --> 00:36:29,306
She forgets things.
She's started wandering.

272
00:36:29,514 --> 00:36:32,725
Well, the staff here
are on call 24/7.

273
00:36:32,934 --> 00:36:36,604
Think of it as independent living
with the edges taken off.

274
00:36:43,152 --> 00:36:44,321
Just in here.

275
00:36:44,529 --> 00:36:47,198
This side of the building
has ocean views.

276
00:36:48,575 --> 00:36:50,410
Handrails in every room,

277
00:36:50,618 --> 00:36:52,119
high toilet seat,

278
00:36:52,328 --> 00:36:55,957
mobility aids if your mother needs help
getting in and out of bed.

279
00:36:56,165 --> 00:37:00,377
No, she's fine with that kind of stuff.
She's fit, she's active. I...

280
00:37:01,463 --> 00:37:04,173
I'm not even sure she's ready
for a place like this.

281
00:37:04,381 --> 00:37:06,258
Well, it's five-star living.

282
00:37:07,927 --> 00:37:10,387
Then there's the lifestyle
and therapy programs,

283
00:37:10,597 --> 00:37:12,974
disability support, computer classes.

284
00:37:13,182 --> 00:37:15,476
Your mum'll make friends in no time.

285
00:37:15,685 --> 00:37:18,520

To be closer to you.

Here, in the house. With you.

331
00:40:08,314 --> 00:40:09,899
I don't think so.

332
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:13,778
I'm not a... project, Kay.

333
00:40:13,986 --> 00:40:16,280
I'm... I'm Sam, Gran.

334
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:17,948
I know who you are.

335
00:40:18,157 --> 00:40:20,785
Well, wouldn't it be better than
moving into an old folks' home?

336
00:40:20,993 --> 00:40:23,954
That's where Mum is right now -
checking out a place in Melbourne.

337
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,166
Here, let me help.

338
00:40:31,837 --> 00:40:33,047
- What's this?
- What?

339
00:40:33,255 --> 00:40:35,191
- What are you doing with this?
- What do you mean?

340
00:40:35,215 --> 00:40:37,092
- This is mine.
- Yeah, Gran, you gave it to...

341
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:39,279
You're trying to steal from me.
You're trying to rob me.

342
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,971
- No. Remember when you...
- Give it back.

343
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,598
- Give it back!
- Ow. Gran.

344
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,516
Ow! Ah!

345
00:40:44,725 --> 00:40:45,726
Oh!

346
00:40:47,102 --> 00:40:49,521
Fuck. Take it!

347
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,752
Gran?

348
00:42:44,302 --> 00:42:46,637
Are these my school reports?

349
00:42:46,846 --> 00:42:49,473
You're throwing these out?
I didn't even know you'd kept them.

350
00:42:51,184 --> 00:42:53,644
Well, I have to make room, don't I?

351
00:42:55,438 --> 00:42:57,440
Room for what, Mum?

352
00:42:57,648 --> 00:42:59,650
This one's moving in.

353
00:43:04,322 --> 00:43:06,657
No, she's not. She...

354
00:43:06,865 --> 00:43:08,659
I think you're confused, Mum.

355
00:43:08,867 --> 00:43:12,288
I'm not sure why you think
it's your decision.

356
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:16,250
How was Melbourne?

357
00:44:11,847 --> 00:44:13,515
Everything alright, Gran?

358
00:44:15,601 --> 00:44:17,477
I don't like this place.

359
00:44:19,312 --> 00:44:21,398
Is that why you installed the lock?

360
00:44:22,691 --> 00:44:24,567
I thought this was where it got in.

361
00:44:25,778 --> 00:44:27,237
Who?

362
00:44:28,363 --> 00:44:30,991
Whoever was coming into the house.

363
00:44:33,326 --> 00:44:36,413
Since your grandfather passed,
this house seems...

364
00:44:38,498 --> 00:44:41,668
...unfamiliar. Bigger, somehow.

365
00:44:48,133 --> 00:44:50,135
This house is the only thing left.

366
00:44:52,137 --> 00:44:53,888
All our memories.

367
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:10,822
I'm glad you're moving in, Sammy.

368
00:45:41,894 --> 00:45:43,563
Are you sure?

369
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:46,208
Gran?

370
00:47:27,708 --> 00:47:29,501
Gran?

371
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:57,087
Kay?

372
00:49:24,657 --> 00:49:26,366
Mum?

373
00:49:46,011 --> 00:49:48,138
What's that noise?

374
00:49:49,431 --> 00:49:51,600
I think there's something in the house.

375
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:54,854
I need to go downstairs.

376
00:49:55,062 --> 00:49:57,689
There's someone down there.

377
00:49:59,984 --> 00:50:02,152
Everything alright in there, Mum?

378
00:50:12,162 --> 00:50:13,997
Sammy?

379
00:50:38,813 --> 00:50:41,024
I'm not being ridiculous.
I can tell.

380
00:50:42,359 --> 00:50:46,154
Sometimes they look at me
and I... I don't think it's really them.

381
00:50:47,781 --> 00:50:50,158
They look like Kay and Sammy,
but it's not them.

382
00:50:51,284 --> 00:50:53,119
They're pretending.

383
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,666
You know what I think?
I think they're just waiting for the day.

384
00:50:57,874 --> 00:51:01,377
I think they're hoping I'll go to sleep
and I won't wake up.

385
00:51:01,586 --> 00:51:04,463
Then they'll dump me
in the ground to rot.

386
00:51:07,008 --> 00:51:09,385
I can see you.

387
00:51:10,469 --> 00:51:12,681
Who are you talking to?

388
00:51:35,661 --> 00:51:38,706
- Gran, you're bleeding.
- I can do it myself.

389
00:51:38,915 --> 00:51:40,833
- You've hurt yourself. Just...
- No!

390
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:43,544
- Gran, stop!
- Get out!

391
00:51:43,752 --> 00:51:44,795
Get out of here!

392
00:51:45,004 --> 00:51:46,755
Get out! Get out! It's my room!

393
00:51:46,965 --> 00:51:48,445
- It's my house! Get out!
- I'm sorry!

394
00:52:17,911 --> 00:52:18,954
Hi, Sam.

395
00:52:19,162 --> 00:52:21,624
- Hey, Jamie. How are you?
- I'm OK.

396
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:24,793
- Is your dad home?
- Uh...

397
00:52:25,002 --> 00:52:26,670
Dad?!

398
00:52:28,088 --> 00:52:31,717
Alex, what happened...
between Jamie and Gran?

399
00:52:34,803 --> 00:52:39,016
They were playing hide-and-seek
and it was Jamie's turn to hide.

400
00:52:40,392 --> 00:52:43,562
And he hid, I guess, in a cupboard
with a lock on it.

401
00:52:45,481 --> 00:52:49,735
Well, she came along and locked the closet
and... left him there.

402
00:52:49,943 --> 00:52:52,445
I think she forgot they were playing.

403
00:52:53,572 --> 00:52:55,448
He was trapped in that cupboard for hours.

404
00:52:56,742 --> 00:52:59,870
When he didn't come home,
I went over there to check on him and...

405
00:53:01,664 --> 00:53:03,415
...Edna said she hadn't seen him.

406
00:53:03,623 --> 00:53:06,794
But I could... I could hear him
screaming from upstairs.

407
00:53:07,002 --> 00:53:11,006
He had paint under his fingernails
just from scratching the door.

408
00:53:13,716 --> 00:53:15,844
So, we've been keeping
our distance a bit.

409
00:53:16,053 --> 00:53:18,806
Yeah. Nah, of course.

410
00:53:19,014 --> 00:53:20,598
I get it.

411
00:53:24,477 --> 00:53:26,897
I'm really sorry
Jamie had to go through that.

412
00:53:27,105 --> 00:53:28,606
OK.

413
00:54:39,761 --> 00:54:40,928
Mum...

414
00:54:41,929 --> 00:54:43,180
Mum, stop.

415
00:54:43,389 --> 00:54:44,724
Stop!

416
00:54:46,558 --> 00:54:48,477
Ow! Jesus!

417
00:54:48,686 --> 00:54:51,105
What are you doing, Mum?!

418
00:54:52,189 --> 00:54:53,733
No! No!

419
00:54:53,941 --> 00:54:56,235
- Give it back!
- No, Mum! No!

420
00:54:56,443 --> 00:54:58,404
I'm still your mother, Kay!

421
00:55:47,994 --> 00:55:50,622
I think these might be safe
out here.

422
00:55:50,831 --> 00:55:52,458
Do you think that's right?

423
00:55:55,794 --> 00:55:57,671
Safe from what, Mum?

424
00:55:58,964 --> 00:56:00,716
I don't know.

425
00:56:02,593 --> 00:56:04,678
I knew it was a bad idea.

426
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:07,681
I hate that window.

427
00:56:07,889 --> 00:56:10,642
I can't bear to look at it
every time I go through that door.

428
00:56:13,186 --> 00:56:14,938
There's such a...

429
00:56:16,482 --> 00:56:19,109
...coldness in the house.

430
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:23,739
This is what I'm like now.
It's all I do.

431
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:25,448
I keep thinking...

432
00:56:25,657 --> 00:56:27,993
...thinking maybe it was
just waiting for me,

433
00:56:28,201 --> 00:56:32,998
maybe it's just been waiting
till I was weak enough.

434
00:56:33,206 --> 00:56:35,000
Alone enough.

435
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:41,547
I wish I could bury it myself
so it can't get at me.

436
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:51,057
I just want to go home.

437
00:56:53,268 --> 00:56:57,605
I just wish I... I could turn around and...

438
00:56:59,107 --> 00:57:00,858
...go back.

439
00:57:06,031 --> 00:57:08,199
I'm losing everything, Kay.

440
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:11,952
No. It's alright. You're not.

441
00:57:13,746 --> 00:57:16,916
I'm here. I'm here to help you, Mum.

442
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:20,878
Come home with me.

443
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:25,383
To Melbourne. Will you... will you
move into my place, Mum?

444
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:29,345
I'm sorry.

445
00:57:31,472 --> 00:57:34,099
I'm sorry. Sorry I wasn't here more.

446
00:57:35,768 --> 00:57:37,687
Please let me help you.

447
00:57:40,898 --> 00:57:42,317
Yeah?

448
00:57:43,734 --> 00:57:45,152
Yeah.

449
00:57:50,408 --> 00:57:52,034
Where's...

450
00:57:54,579 --> 00:57:56,288
Where's my...

451
00:57:59,249 --> 00:58:00,835
Where's everyone?

452
00:58:04,088 --> 00:58:06,090
Your photo album?

453
00:58:06,298 --> 00:58:07,800
It's here.

454
00:58:09,509 --> 00:58:11,220
It's right here.

455
00:58:13,347 --> 00:58:15,182
Where's everyone?

456
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:18,686
They're here. They're here. I'm here.

457
00:58:18,894 --> 00:58:20,771
It's alright, Mum.

458
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,485
Mum...

459
00:58:26,693 --> 00:58:28,362
I won't leave you.

460
00:59:46,272 --> 00:59:48,482
I'll get dinner started.
What do you feel like?

461
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:51,570
Thanks, dear.

462
00:59:57,075 --> 00:59:58,743
Sam, we're back!

463
01:00:21,307 --> 01:00:22,808

Fuck this...

465
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:32,854
What?

466
01:03:00,131 --> 01:03:02,842
No, no. No.

467
01:03:06,262 --> 01:03:07,597

468

Stop it! Mum! Open...

Mum...

01:07:29,773 --> 01:07:32,651
Mum! Open the door
right now! Mum!

495
01:07:32,859 --> 01:07:34,028
Oh!

496
01:07:37,572 --> 01:07:38,657
Your chest, Mum...

Mum?

01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:08,978
Mum?

499
01:08:16,570 --> 01:08:18,738
Mum? Mum, stop it.

500
01:08:18,947 --> 01:08:20,949
Mum!

501
01:08:41,928 --> 01:08:43,012
Mum?

502
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,726
Oh, shit...

503
01:09:04,658 --> 01:09:06,494
What?

504
01:09:37,191 --> 01:09:39,568
What the fuck?

505
01:10:48,053 --> 01:10:49,512
Oh, what...?

506
01:11:16,623 --> 01:11:17,999
Mum?

507
01:11:23,546 --> 01:11:25,590
Mum, please, can we go back now?

508
01:11:28,843 --> 01:11:30,928
Ah! Oh!

509
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:34,266
You're not Kay.

510
01:11:34,474 --> 01:11:35,933
Oh!

511
01:11:36,142 --> 01:11:38,227
- I don't know you.
- No! Mum!

512
01:11:38,436 --> 01:11:40,062
No!

513
01:11:55,662 --> 01:11:57,079
Aah!

514
01:13:30,464 --> 01:13:32,215
Mum? Mum?

515
01:13:32,424 --> 01:13:33,717
Mum?

516
01:13:47,105 --> 01:13:49,941
No... No!

517
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:51,860
Mum?

518
01:14:04,998 --> 01:14:05,998
Aaah!

519
01:14:06,166 --> 01:14:08,376
- Mum?
- Sam!

520
01:14:08,584 --> 01:14:09,836
- Mum?!
- Where are you?

521
01:14:10,045 --> 01:14:11,087
- I'm down here!
- Where?!

522
01:14:11,296 --> 01:14:12,756
Here!

523
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:15,801
Sam! Sam!

524
01:14:16,009 --> 01:14:17,635
Oh, Sam! Mum is not...

525
01:14:17,844 --> 01:14:19,470
It's not her anymore.

526
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:24,475
- Mum...
- Yeah.

527
01:14:44,036 --> 01:14:45,246
Here. Give it to me.

528
01:14:45,455 --> 01:14:46,706
Give that to me.

529
01:14:46,914 --> 01:14:49,917
Hold that. Hold it!

530
01:15:09,937 --> 01:15:11,271
Mum?

531
01:15:15,526 --> 01:15:16,819
Is that you, Gran?

532
01:15:17,027 --> 01:15:19,363
It's OK, Sam.

533
01:15:19,572 --> 01:15:20,990
It's OK.

534
01:15:24,952 --> 01:15:26,245
Mum!

535
01:15:26,453 --> 01:15:28,205
Go, Sam, go! Get in there, go!

536
01:15:28,413 --> 01:15:30,666
Go! Go!

537
01:15:32,752 --> 01:15:33,961
Get out of here!

538
01:15:34,169 --> 01:15:36,088
- Aah!
- Go!

539
01:15:37,882 --> 01:15:39,299
Mum...

540
01:15:40,384 --> 01:15:41,510
I got you. I got you!

541
01:15:41,719 --> 01:15:42,719
Pull me...

542
01:15:42,803 --> 01:15:44,096
Aaagh!

543
01:15:44,304 --> 01:15:45,514
You're almost out!

544
01:15:45,723 --> 01:15:47,099
I've got you! I've got you!

545
01:15:49,018 --> 01:15:51,020
Get me out! Get me out of here!

546
01:15:51,228 --> 01:15:52,479
Pull me!

547
01:15:59,278 --> 01:16:02,114
No! Mum!

548
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:05,325
Mum! Mum!

549
01:16:11,248 --> 01:16:12,791
Mum!

550
01:16:16,086 --> 01:16:18,172
Mum!

551
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,831
Come on.

552
01:16:59,337 --> 01:17:01,005
Kay.

553
01:17:21,109 --> 01:17:22,944
Mum?

554
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:39,127
Come on.

555
01:17:45,967 --> 01:17:47,886
Mum, what is it?

556
01:17:55,309 --> 01:17:57,395
I can't leave her.

557
01:17:58,521 --> 01:18:00,148
What?

558
01:18:01,649 --> 01:18:03,151
Mum!

559
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:06,320
Please don't!
It's not Gran anymore!

560
01:18:06,529 --> 01:18:08,156
It's not Gran!

561
01:18:08,364 --> 01:18:09,490
Mum!

562
01:18:09,698 --> 01:18:11,659
Please come back!

563
01:18:11,867 --> 01:18:14,328
Please come back!

564
01:18:15,413 --> 01:18:16,580
Mum!

565
01:18:18,124 --> 01:18:19,667
Mum, what are you doing?

566
01:18:21,627 --> 01:18:25,381
Mum? Mum, please, let's just go!

567
01:18:29,635 --> 01:18:30,719
Mum!

568
01:23:29,849 --> 01:23:31,934
Shh...

569
01:23:34,979 --> 01:23:36,814
Shh...

570
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:45,948
Shh...

570
01:23:46,305 --> 01:24:46,443

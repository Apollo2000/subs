extremely flattering summer dress.

I learned years ago.

00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,038
When people have to poop,
they get embarrassed.

Probably, yes.

You know, if the Joneses seem a little
bit more affectionate than we do,

421
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,073
it's because they haven't had to mute
their passions the way we have

422
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,719
'cause the kids have been around.

1403
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:56,520
I won't tell anybody.

Yeah, keep it quiet.

1405
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,439
There's this other thing I needed to ask.

01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:03,514
I know you guys are undercover and
this whole thing is a setup, but...

The other day at the Cobra Club,

1408
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,440
was that about getting me drunk
and having me betray my co-workers

1409
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:12,834
or was that about two guys, you know,
maybe starting a friendship?

1410
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:15,958
It was about getting you drunk
and betraying your co-workers.

Oh, okay. Yeah.

But the indoor skydiving...

- Locking it up. Hey, hey.

One other thing. I know I'm not
a licensed therapist, okay?

with one another, okay?

01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,519
- That's good.
- What does it taste like?

2021
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:32,758
It tastes like Mikey's sock.

2022
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:34,718
But I mean that in a good way.
Here, try it.

Oh, I miss Mikey's little feet
and his socks.

Yeah. Here.

You've gotta be kidding me!

- Can I take this?
- Are you kidding me?

We are here because of you.

2035
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:02,234
You told us about this place
and that's why we came!

2036
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:04,113
You are here. In Marrakesh.

2037
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,759
- That's a good memory. Wow.
- Amazing!

- What?
- That's amazing.

- My God.
- You have a baby!

2040
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:10,956
- Yes, he just fell asleep.
- He just fell asleep.

You had a baby? You old dogs!

2042
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:15,636
Does that mean you guys left the agency?

- Well, yeah. It's a very...
- Well...

- Yeah?
- Long story.

But we can't really get into it right now.

But, it's good to see you!

Jeff, do me a big favor? Will you just...

2048
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:28,239
- scoot a little bit to your right?
- Yeah. Sure thing.

2049
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:29,549
Thank you!

2050
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:31,313
I am blown away, you guys. This is un...

2051
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:33,835
Jeff, I don't want you
to turn around right now,

2052
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:37,357
but there are four guys in fezzes
behind you on the...

2053
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:38,715
Jeff, I just said don't turn around.

2054
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,359
Jeff, I just specifically
asked you not to turn around.

2055
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,153
I know but you said there are four
guys in fezzes behind me.

2056
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,469
We're in Morocco. There's a lot of fezzes.

2057
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:44,994
But it's human nature,
I think, to turn around

2058
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:46,673
to something like that. Don't you think?

2059
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:48,194
Honey. We blew their cover again.

2060
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,312
- No! No.
- What?

2061
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:51,959
- We should feed the baby?
- I think we should feed the baby.

2062
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:53,714
- If you can just pass me the bottle...
- We blew their cover?

2063
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:55,120
- ...that would be great.
- Darn it.

2064
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:57,157
- Can you hold this bag for me?
- Do you mind holding the baby?

2065
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:59,994
Before you freak out, it's just a baby.

- All right? Don't worry.
- Kids are great! I have pictures.

- Karen, how do you get...
- I'll tell you what.

2068
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:04,719
Just put it in here and show me.

2069
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,200
Kind of see what I'm dealing with.

01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:07,794
Okay. I see now.

[TIM] Okay? See what that is?

- It's okay, honey.
- I need you to breathe.

2073
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:13,039
- You can do it.
- You've done this before.

2074
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:16,670
On three, I want you to get down,
and take cover. Okay?

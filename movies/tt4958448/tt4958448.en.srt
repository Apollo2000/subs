1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,958
This show contains
scenes not suitable for children

2
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:06,500
and includes nudity and drug use.
Discretion is advised.

3
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:19,958
This story is a replica
of the original.

4
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,125
Ready?

5
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:23,416
Huh?

6
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,916
One, two, three!

7
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:22,791
One!

8
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,208
One, two!
One, two, three, four!

9
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:41,041
Juan always said he didn't believe
anything from History class.

10
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,333
Or books, for that matter.

11
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:47,416
How could they be so sure
what Hernan Cortes thought...

12
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:50,625
...or Montezuma,
or Alexander the Great?

13
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,041
He said it was all made up.

14
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,250
He said no one could know
why someone did what they did...

15
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,500
...except for the person
who did it.

16
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,791
And more often than not,
not even them.

17
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,041
Water.

18
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,791
Skies crisscrossed by clouds.

19
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,249
Silent mountains.

20
00:02:08,499 --> 00:02:11,041
Elements controlled by Tlaloc.

21
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:18,166
For centuries, the 300 A.D. monolith
slumbered in a ravine.

22
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,166
Juan told me about the time
when some engineers...

23
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:24,833
...took the god Tlaloc
away from his home.

24
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:30,708
People were angry and sad,
but they took him anyway.

25
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,250
Without asking for permission
or forgiveness.

26
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:40,833
On the huge platform
powered by 860 hp...

27
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:44,541
...the god's transportation
took place over two stages.

28
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:48,791
From the shores of Texcoco Lake
to the Chapultepec Forest.

29
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:54,833
Power and telephone cables
had to be removed along the way.

30
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,208
And all because
they had to fill...

31
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:01,833
...the new anthropology museum
with old things.

32
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,291
The city was lit up...

33
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:13,291
...as Tlaloc traversed it
in his immortal slumber.

34
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,833
Witnessing the centuries-old
journey of the god...

35
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:22,625
...hundreds of thousands
watched in awe and curiosity.

36
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,166
- Photo!
- Stop it, stop.

37
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,416
- Get down.
- Oh, sweetie.

38
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,333
Soon after the museum opened,
Juan's father...

39
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,583
...took Juan to see Tlaloc
and told him about the plunder.

40
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,875
- Honey, please smile.
- I'm smiling.

41
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,666
Juan was five years old.

42
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:51,250
- Smile, Juan! Show your teeth!
- He never forgot the story.

43
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:57,750
"Death is our eternal companion"

44
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:02,458
"Always to our left"

45
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:07,375
"An arm's distance away"

46
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,750
The first time I visited the museum,
back in eighth grade...

47
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:27,166
...I had to copy the captions
next to the pieces...

48
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:31,541
...and get my notebook stamped
to prove I had been there.

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,583
I heard stories about
the creation, and wars...

50
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,458
...and about the things
that used to be here.

51
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:44,458
"It whispers in your ear
You felt its icy touch"

52
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:51,166
"The way you felt it today"

53
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,958
But I don't remember
any of it.

54
00:04:55,791 --> 00:05:02,750
"It has always been
Watching over you"

55
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:10,125
"And it always will"

56
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,416
Next piece, please.

57
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,083
Turn it off.

58
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,041
Turn it off.

59
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,958
Juan.

60
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,666
Juan!

61
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,958
- Turn off the light!
- Sorry, sorry.

62
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,333
The year of the earthquake,
Juan spent the summer...

63
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,958
...working at the museum
to pay for his weed.

64
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,125
Every day for three months
they took photographs...

65
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,125
...of each object
at the Maya room.

66
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,250
And it seemed
they'd never finish.

67
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,125
Rotate it counterclockwise,
please.

68
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,750
What are you doing?
No touching without gloves!

69
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,875
Juan, if you touch a piece again,
I'm sending you home.

70
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:09,208
Juan used to say it was impossible
to know how things start...

71
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,208
...we can only know
how they end...

72
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,166
...once they've ended.

73
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:19,041
I don't know if those photos
were the beginning of it all.

74
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,333
I don't know.

75
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,500
Where does an idea begin?

76
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,208
Who can tell?

77
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:31,625
MUSEUM

78
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,625
Wilson. Wilson.

79
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,041
- Shoot.
- I said no.

80
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,125
- Shoot.
- I don't want to.

81
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,083
- Shoot.
- Cut it out.

82
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,333
Ciudad Satelite,
23 km from Mexico City.

83
00:08:34,874 --> 00:08:37,958
Shoot!

84
00:08:38,749 --> 00:08:39,958
Shoot!

85
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:41,791
Shoot!

86
00:08:42,874 --> 00:08:44,583
- Shoot, you bastard!
- I'm leaving.

87
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,708
- Shoot, you bastard!
- I'm leaving.

88
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:51,541
- First we finish this, I told you how.
- I'm taking my dad to the doctor.

89
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:55,583
- Either shoot or stand here.
- I don't want to, I'm serious.

90
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,000
Alexander the Great had
diamond-tipped arrows made for him.

91
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,083
They could go through
a Mongol's head.

92
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,416
These arrows couldn't
puncture a cat's head...

93
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,958
...but they'll pierce the cube.

94
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,541
But what's the point?

95
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,583
I need to know
I can trust you.

96
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,666
You can.

97
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,875
- What are you doing, asshole?
- You moved!

98
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,750
- You could've hit me in the eye!
- You told me to do it!

99
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,041
- You could've hit me in the eye!
- What happened?

100
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,083
- Nothing.
- Wilson shot at my head.

101
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,541
- Why did you shoot at his head?
- It's not true.

102
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,375
- I thought I could trust you.
- You can.

103
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,500
- So, why did you shoot at me?
- Why did you shoot at him?

104
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,541
I didn't.

105
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,375
Shorty, they're fighting out there.
Lalo doesn't want to pay.

106
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,291
Who said you could
call me that?

107
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,375
I'd go out if I were you,
Shorty.

108
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,291
- I thought I could trust you.
- You can.

109
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,666
So why did you shoot me
in the head?

110
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,375
Can I borrow it?

111
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,291
THE HARD LIFE OF AN EASY WOMAN

112
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,208
No, Scherezada Rios stays here.
It's a hard one to find.

113
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:37,166
All right, if you don't pay,
you can't play.

114
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,291
What's up, Lalo?

115
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,375
Lalo has been playing
and hasn't paid yet.

116
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:46,208
Pay up, Lalo, don't be a dick.
Oh, you don't want to pay?

117
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,791
In that case, move it.
Move aside, let me--

118
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,541
Is that level 15?

119
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:55,791
Wait a minute.

120
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,958
I'll cover you.

121
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:03,541
But just this once, got it?
We can't set a precedent, Camila.

122
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,041
This isn't a game, fuckers.
We must think like the enemy.

123
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,416
As if we came from another planet.

124
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:15,541
When King Pakal returns in his ship
and everything comes to an end...

125
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,125
...don't say I didn't warn you,
you little shits.

126
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,500
- Juan, you're still here?
- No!

127
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,916
They're waiting for you!

128
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:28,083
- Ben, are you staying for dinner?
- I can't, my dad needs me.

129
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:31,583
- How is he doing?
- Good, they put him on oxygen.

130
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,958
I'm really sorry.
Give him one of the fruitcakes.

131
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,625
- My daughter made them.
- Don't use English words, Mom.

132
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,625
You can say fruitcake
in Spanish, you know?

133
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,583
Julio is waiting for you.
It's about the--

134
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,583
The Santa costume?

135
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,083
- I don't want to, Mom.
- Juan, come here.

136
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:57,500
No, Juan, I keep tucking it in,
but it's still too big on you.

137
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,541
It's hard to believe you are
Dr. Juan's grandson.

138
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:05,041
You should dress as an elf,
it would fit you better.

139
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,166
They've informed us that
the Modern Art Museum...

140
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:12,291
...and the Anthropology Museum
will remain closed...

141
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,041
...from today until
January 5th...

142
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,916
...while a new ventilation system
is being installed.

143
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:21,958
They're working day and night
to be ready when school starts.

144
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:26,666
So, this holiday season
there will be no museums.

145
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,625
- Can I use your phone?
- Wait, don't move yet.

146
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,958
- Let me finish.
- It's fine like this.

147
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,750
Put it on Mom's tab!

148
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,500
GUARDHOUSE

149
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,583
ACETONE

150
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,041
HARDWARE STORE

151
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,083
- Duct tape?
- Yes, duct tape.

152
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,833
- How many nails?
- A bunch.

153
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,291
- Thin copper wire, six meters.
- Six meters copper wire.

154
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,041
That's too much.

155
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,041
- Alligators?
- What are those?

156
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,791
Oh, the crocodiles!
Yes, I'll take a few.

157
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,125
- Do you have any acetone?
- What?

158
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:10,791
Ether?

159
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,416
Since Juan was a kid,
every Christmas...

160
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:20,250
...his grandfather dressed as Santa
and gave out presents after dinner.

161
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:25,250
He died that year, so everyone
agreed Juan would take over.

162
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:29,250
Juan protested, saying he'd rather
dress as Quetzatcoatl...

163
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:34,500
...because Santa Claus was a tool
to indoctrinate kids into capitalism.

164
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,125
His protests went ignored.

165
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,458
Take a deep breath.

166
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:00,916
Get dressed.

167
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,000
Your blood pressure
and resting heart rate are high.

168
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,125
- I'm prescribing you some pills.
- You did that already.

169
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,541
Hey, Dad...

170
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,708
I need to use your car,
can I borrow it?

171
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:19,375
I have something important to do
after Christmas dinner.

172
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,125
What are we going to do
with you, bud?

173
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:26,791
I already paid the deposit
for the place at the mall.

174
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:31,875
- I'm pretty much set to go.
- You're not a veterinarian yet.

175
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,583
I know that.
I'm graduating soon.

176
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,541
- I'm not like Uncle Oscar.
- Did you pick up the suit?

177
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:45,916
Yeah, I even got it tailored.
It's going to fit great.

178
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,708
Dad?

179
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,666
Am I dying soon, Dad?

180
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,750
Yes?

181
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,291
Yes, sweetie, show her in.

182
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:11,000
So I guess I'll see you
tonight, yeah?

183
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,375
You'll be there, right?

184
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,250
- I just filled the tank.
- Thanks.

185
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,458
- Thank you.
- Hey, Chiva.

186
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:28,291
- Time for you annual drug test?
- Anal, yes. Pretty wild.

187
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,458
Try it, you might like it.

188
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:34,583
- Dad said work calls only.
- What? What did Dad say?

189
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,666
- What did he say?
- Let go of me, asshole.

190
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,041
- Hello?
- Wilson?

191
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,791
Where have you been all day?
It has to be tonight.

192
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,458
What?

193
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,833
What do you mean "what"?

194
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,583
- But it's Christmas.
- So?

195
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:33,250
- You said the 31st.
- It has to be tonight.

196
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:37,125
- You said New Year's Eve.
- I just saw the news.

197
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:41,166
Repairs start tomorrow,
it's going to be crowded.

198
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,208
- It has to be tonight.
- Are we even ready?

199
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,208
Sure we're ready,
we've gone over and over it.

200
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,916
I already called Bosco,
I got the car, everything.

201
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,625
Yeah, but I can't tonight.
I'm having dinner with Dad.

202
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,375
I'm not asking, moron.

203
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:59,625
I'm not asking you to fucking prom.
You're coming tonight.

204
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:03,375
I guess we'll have to see
because...

205
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,666
...the doctor said it might be
his last Christmas.

206
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:11,083
Look, I'll see you at midnight
at the usual place.

207
00:17:11,374 --> 00:17:13,666
- Yes, Juan.
- Don't be late.

208
00:17:13,749 --> 00:17:15,249
We'll see.

209
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,666
Hello?

210
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,916
- What are you up to, Shorty?
- Nothing.

211
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,624
Eeny, meeny, miney, mo.
Catch a tiger by the toe.

212
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,541
If he hollers, let him go.

213
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,583
One, two, three, four...

214
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,500
One, two...

215
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:35,958
Why don't you hide here?
Get under the table.

216
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,041
No one will find you.

217
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,458
I saw you, under the chair!

218
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,291
You're mistaken,
there's no one here.

219
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:45,625
Hey, have you met
Oscar's girlfriend?

220
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:50,583
- He has a girlfriend?
- Why else ask for another seat?

221
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,916
- What?
- There's no more ham.

222
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,375
Don't fill up with snacks.
Wait a little.

223
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,666
Have some cheese and olives.
Don't fill up before dinner.

224
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,958
- She's his student!?
- We'll meet her soon.

225
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,000
- What is this stuff?
- It's pâté, thank you very much.

226
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:16,333
Hello! Merry Christmas!
This is Gaby.

227
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,208
Gaby, my family.

228
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,875
- Who's your guest?
- This is Gaby.

229
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,541
- Introduce us.
- Hello.

230
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,083
- My brother.
- Nice to meet you.

231
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,875
- Uncle Oscar, how are you?
- I'm fine.

232
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,875
I'll take your bag.

233
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,416
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- The lady of the house.

234
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,333
- My niece.
- Susana!

235
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:41,208
- It's Christmas, they're dating.
- Precisely, it's Christmas!

236
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,666
Good evening, sir.
I brought bread and cider.

237
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,833
This one has a bite mark!

238
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,166
- Neto was hungry.
- Must've been the baker!

239
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:01,458
- Did you taste that one, too!
- No, it's unopened!

240
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,500
- Really, it is!
- He says it's unopened.

241
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,291
Shorty, where are you going
with those bags?

242
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,416
- It's your kids, chopped up.
- Asshole.

243
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,416
- I'm dumping them in the dam.
- Don't joke about that!

244
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,666
- What do you want, chipmunk?
- Dad asked why you're here...

245
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,708
...instead of downstairs,
with everyone.

246
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,291
Why do you always
isolate yourself?

247
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,833
- Aren't you happy?
- It's Christmas, why would I be happy?

248
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,416
You should be thankful,
you have a family.

249
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:46,166
- Some people don't, but you do.
- Thank you, family.

250
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:49,416
Are you doing Grandpa's thing?
Did the suit fit you?

251
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,250
I bet it didn't.

252
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,041
It was too big on you.
I'm sure it looks huge on you.

253
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,250
If it was green instead,
you'd be a nice elf.

254
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:03,333
If you do it, do it right.
It's very important you do it right.

255
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:07,041
- Don't screw up.
- You smell like period blood.

256
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,500
You smell like baby shit,
you fucking dwarf.

257
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,041
Make way for the turkey!

258
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,833
Give a round of applause for the cook!

259
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,375
Everyone, hush!

260
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,500
- Please, sit down.
- Children, sit down!

261
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:43,125
I just want to say...

262
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,208
...that this has been
a terrible year.

263
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:53,791
I want you to join me in a toast
to someone very special...

264
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,083
...to my father.
Thank you, cheers!

265
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,958
- Cheers, cheers.
- To Grandpa!

266
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,375
- To Grandpa.
- And to your joy as well.

267
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,625
And to the joys
this year brought us!

268
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,291
...its scales will dry up.

269
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:16,041
No, Keiko means "lucky one,"
it doesn't bring you luck.

270
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,625
So kids can see it!
It was in Sea Wo--

271
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,916
- It was in Sea World, right?
- Norway.

272
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,125
- It was in Norway.
- In the sea.

273
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,125
- Norway?
- Yeah, right?

274
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:29,000
It's so that people
can have a good time.

275
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,125
We went there recently.
We loved it, it was great.

276
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,125
But he was asking why
bring it now?

277
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,250
It definitely has to be
a smoke screen.

278
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:42,791
The park can do whatever
they like with their money.

279
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:48,166
- It's a private company.
- The government can't interfere.

280
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:51,208
But how can you deny
state involvement...

281
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,875
...if they closed up
the freeway...

282
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:59,333
...so that two huge trucks could
move the orca to the park...

283
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,916
- ...before its scales dried up?
- Whales don't have scales.

284
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,791
- Got it?
- Having fun in the Pacific...

285
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:10,291
...and waking up in Mexico City
is not good luck.

286
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:13,416
But why do it now?

287
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:17,166
Why, at this point for the country,
with the peso as low as it is...

288
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:20,375
...and ties between the cartels
and the government?

289
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,916
- Enlighten us, Juan.
- Juan, do you know about orcas?

290
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:27,500
- What?
- About orcas, like Keiko.

291
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:31,416
Hey, Christmas, right here!
We're having a conversation.

292
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:34,833
Don't worry, you can go
play Atari with the kids...

293
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:38,250
...while the rest of us grown ups
talk about politics.

294
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:41,166
- Keiko will die there.
- It will?

295
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:44,625
Then, they'll chop him up
and sell him outside the park.

296
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,875
Yeah, fish tacos!

297
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:52,333
Did you know they live
with their mothers?

298
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:54,958
All their lives,
especially males.

299
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,708
- They stay with their moms.
- So you're an orca?

300
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:02,500
Is your thesis about whales,
Shorty?

301
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,250
It's been nine years.

302
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:09,291
Wait, he's been doing
field practice for nine years...

303
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:12,125
...and his dissertation
is about masturbation.

304
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:16,041
- What? Tell them.
- What will the title be?

305
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,375
Are you leaving?

306
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:22,291
- Don't go!
- What's the title?

307
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:25,125
"Masturbatory habits
in Ciudad Satelite."

308
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:28,250
- It's Christmas, can't we have fun?
- But he started it!

309
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,333
We're all having fun!

310
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:49,291
What?

311
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:50,791
Shorty, it's time for the family picture.

312
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:54,250
I know, I'm coming.
Give me a minute.

313
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:59,375
Hey, would you like to see
something spectacular?

314
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,291
You would?

315
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,916
- Know where Santa's presents are?
- Where?

316
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,666
Right here.

317
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,333
You're lying.

318
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:09,625
Look.

319
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,333
Let's see here.

320
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:15,958
Do you see this?

321
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:19,625
This one's for Iker,
this one's for Pilar.

322
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,125
This one's for you, Lalo!
Should we open it?

323
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,416
A Millennium Falcon!

324
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:33,041
What a lucky kid!
Isn't it great?

325
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:40,375
I saw your mom come in
and leave them here.

326
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:43,458
Do you know what
that means?

327
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,958
All right, then.

328
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:52,916
Think about it.

329
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:08,833
Santa's coming soon. Whoever is
not in the photo gets no present.

330
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:12,958
- You won't fit in the frame!
- Nephew, come here.

331
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:16,291
Did I tell you about the fire
at your grandparents' house?

332
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:19,750
Only about a hundred times.

333
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:24,791
She doesn't know this one,
so act surprised.

334
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:28,125
This ingrate's grandparents,
meaning my parents...

335
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:32,208
...had a house in Novelist St.
It was really cool!

336
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:36,583
It was a modernist house,
one of the biggest in Satelite.

337
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:39,500
It was actually built by
Mario Pani in the '50s...

338
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:41,958
...back when all this
was empty hills.

339
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,625
Hey, what's going on?
Are you in a hurry?

340
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:46,500
Just tell the story already.

341
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,416
Why do I love this one
if he's so rude?

342
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:50,916
Wow!

343
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:53,833
- Cool!
- These are Legos!

344
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:58,250
- It's the one I wanted!
- Yes! Battleship!

345
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:01,666
I can make a polar bear!

346
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:03,625
What's all this?

347
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:06,041
What's going on, Pilar?

348
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:08,291
You're the oldest,
what happened?

349
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:11,291
- Juan.
- Juan told Lalo to open the gifts.

350
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:13,708
- He said they were here.
- Eduardo, come here!

351
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,416
Come here!

352
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:19,291
Give me that.
What did Juan tell you?

353
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:22,458
He said the presents were here
and we could open them.

354
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:26,666
- And you told everyone?
- He said I could.

355
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,125
- Was that nice?
- No.

356
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,708
Don't you laugh
or I'll smack your mouth!

357
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:34,125
Anyway, back in 1959,
that house burned down.

358
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:39,375
The ground floor was lost,
furniture, curtains, all of it.

359
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:43,916
We were in pajamas on the street,
watching it go up in flames.

360
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:46,500
The fire department came,
so did the police.

361
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:48,791
They even wrote about it
in the newspaper.

362
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:51,708
And do you know
why it burned down?

363
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:56,791
- You left the stereo on.
- That's the official version.

364
00:26:57,125 --> 00:27:00,791
What actually happened
was entirely different.

365
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:04,041
- You bastard!
- Hey, Adriana!

366
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:08,125
Mom, your son told my kids
that Santa's not real...

367
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:09,583
...and where we hid
the presents!

368
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,041
- No, I didn't.
- Are you serious?

369
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:15,291
- Yes, you did!
- I didn't "say" it.

370
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,041
- I didn't tell him!
- You're a fucking moron!

371
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:21,625
- You fucking moron!
- Hey, hey, calm down.

372
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:24,166
Do you even know how much
Santa means to them?

373
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,750
- Listen to me!
- Enough of that! Stop!

374
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:39,583
When Juan left that night,
he never returned again.

375
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:48,125
Someone who looked like him
came back, but it wasn't him.

376
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:54,958
Good girl, yes you are.
Where's this moron?

377
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:57,000
Where is this moron?

378
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:35,333
Since we were kids,
Juan and I had our usual place.

379
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:39,208
Only we knew where
the usual place was.

380
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:43,916
- Where have you been?
- You said midnight sharp.

381
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:48,416
I was at the usual place
at midnight sharp.

382
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:52,333
I thought you weren't coming.

383
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:56,708
- Yes, Juan, I'm here.
- I see that.

384
00:28:57,541 --> 00:29:00,125
When we got into college,
an old friend of Juan's...

385
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:03,208
...called Pepe Soto
took us out to celebrate.

386
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:05,833
On the way back,
Juan stopped at that sign...

387
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:08,250
...and painted the name
of our profession.

388
00:29:08,541 --> 00:29:11,833
He said it was insulting that
there was even an Actors St...

389
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:16,333
...and not a single street in Satelite
to honor our noble field.

390
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,458
VETERINARIANS

391
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,583
Here.

392
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,750
Merry Christmas.

393
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,250
The Night of the Mayas.

394
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,958
Thanks, Juan.

395
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:40,750
I saw your dad through the window,
he looked better.

396
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,333
What time will we get
back home?

397
00:29:58,125 --> 00:30:00,125
Don't start with that.

398
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:16,583
From this point on,
there's no turning back.

399
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:18,708
Yes, Juan.

400
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:23,208
We're no longer like
our stupid families.

401
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:24,916
Yes.

402
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:29,666
No one has ever
done this before.

403
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,833
Do you understand?

404
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:34,833
Yes, Juan.

405
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:38,958
You told me
I could trust you.

406
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:42,000
You can.

407
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,708
I know.

408
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:50,208
Let's go.

409
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:58,000
Wilson!

410
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:03,541
Wilson!

411
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:08,208
Go, go, go.

412
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,750
This stinks like ass.

413
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:03,666
Make do, Wilson.

414
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:31,291
Are you sure?

415
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:32,833
I am.

416
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:35,916
Eighty percent.

417
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:40,708
Sixty percent.

418
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:47,166
- There's no alarm, trust me.
- How could there not be?

419
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:55,000
The headdress, too?

420
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:56,916
No.

421
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,875
Someone beat us to it.

422
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:03,750
The original... is in Austria.

423
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,041
Do we care?

424
00:44:39,791 --> 00:44:41,458
Stop it, stop.

425
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,083
What happened?

426
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,000
It's Pakal.

427
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,166
- What?
- It's Pakal!

428
00:46:21,916 --> 00:46:23,166
Juan?

429
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:39,291
Juan, are you OK?

430
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:41,625
What's going on, man?

431
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:45,500
Just breathe.

432
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:48,500
Juan, just breathe.

433
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:51,083
We're almost out.

434
00:47:22,166 --> 00:47:27,000
Do you realize, Wilson?
Benjamin, do you realize?

435
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:30,083
Did you ever imagine?

436
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:33,333
Did you ever imagine!?
We fucking rule!

437
00:47:33,416 --> 00:47:36,250
We fucking rule!
We fucking rule, Wilson!

438
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,375
- I have to pee.
- We fucking rule!

439
00:47:39,916 --> 00:47:41,583
I have to pee.

440
00:47:42,416 --> 00:47:44,416
We're almost there, Wilson!

441
00:47:45,208 --> 00:47:47,416
- I have to pee.
- Hold it.

442
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:50,041
- I have to pee right now.
- Wilson, hey!

443
00:47:50,416 --> 00:47:52,125
What the fuck are you doing?!

444
00:47:54,916 --> 00:47:56,291
Wilson!

445
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,750
Wilson!

446
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,416
Wilson!

447
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,125
I've always wanted
to do this.

448
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:15,541
Look at you,
fucking Wilson!

449
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:19,000
Do you realize?
You're the king of Satelite!

450
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:23,166
I mean, we both are.

451
00:48:25,083 --> 00:48:28,500
We are the Aztec kings
of Naucalpan.

452
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,000
Wow.

453
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:35,083
- So?
- So what?

454
00:48:35,375 --> 00:48:37,625
- Now what?
- Now, we celebrate.

455
00:48:37,875 --> 00:48:40,750
But we're taking them to Bosco
so he can sell them, right?

456
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,750
He did tell you he could
sell them, didn't he?

457
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,666
- Is that all you care about?
- Is it true?

458
00:48:47,083 --> 00:48:51,791
Shit, just let me enjoy this.
You sound like my dad.

459
00:48:53,208 --> 00:48:54,666
Sorry, Juan.

460
00:48:57,333 --> 00:48:58,750
But, did he?

461
00:49:31,041 --> 00:49:34,958
So that's the official version about
the fire at your grandparents'.

462
00:49:35,416 --> 00:49:38,583
But what really happened...

463
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,458
...was something
entirely different.

464
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:48,333
Your dad had met your mother
shortly before the fire.

465
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:54,000
He never disobeyed our dad,
except in those days.

466
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,083
He went rebellious on us.

467
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,125
That night...

468
00:50:00,416 --> 00:50:03,916
...while everyone slept,
he brought her home.

469
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:08,666
Right there in the living room,
what better place, right?

470
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:11,375
And then he... you know.

471
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,208
Your mother has always been
a very attractive woman.

472
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:21,250
Anyway, long story short,
once he finished banging her...

473
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:26,541
...he forgot to put out the candles
he had lit to set the mood.

474
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:30,791
And when he came back,
the living room was on fire.

475
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:35,250
His first thought was to wake me,
looking scared shitless...

476
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:37,875
...and that's when...

477
00:50:38,666 --> 00:50:41,666
...when we agreed
I'd take the blame for it.

478
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:46,625
I called the fire department
and we woke everyone up.

479
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,041
Why?

480
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:55,375
Back then, I was always
playing my Bach records...

481
00:50:55,666 --> 00:50:58,541
...and I always forgot
to turn off the stereo.

482
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:02,625
Dad used to get angry,
he said it would catch fire...

483
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:05,541
...so no one ever
questioned the story.

484
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:07,916
Besides, well...

485
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,750
...by then I had already
dropped out of school...

486
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:15,916
...and had gone in and out
of the hospital.

487
00:51:16,291 --> 00:51:18,958
I had even gotten Nelly
pregnant.

488
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:23,500
No one expected
anything else from me...

489
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,541
...so that's what I gave them.

490
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:27,958
I don't know why, nephew...

491
00:51:28,416 --> 00:51:30,541
...and I hope I'm wrong...

492
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,750
...but it seems you're walking
near the monster pit...

493
00:51:35,041 --> 00:51:37,000
...and if you fall in...

494
00:51:37,666 --> 00:51:43,291
...and the monsters grab you,
they won't ever let you go.

495
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:50,416
What did you think of Gaby?

496
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:53,208
She's hot, right?

497
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:57,416
I bet you'd fuck her.

498
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:05,333
Yes.

499
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,458
Hey, Dad.

500
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:34,333
What's going on?

501
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:38,416
Are you all right?

502
00:52:40,125 --> 00:52:42,375
Did you have
trouble sleeping?

503
00:52:46,416 --> 00:52:48,041
What?

504
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:52,916
What?

505
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:13,250
Where were you, Shorty?
Have you seen the news?

506
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:17,291
- Where were you, son?
- I asked Benjamin to stay for lunch.

507
00:54:17,375 --> 00:54:20,333
The thieves knew the value
of the pieces...

508
00:54:20,666 --> 00:54:24,500
...as they took the ones easiest
to transport and hide.

509
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:27,666
Some of the most
valuable of all time.

510
00:54:27,958 --> 00:54:31,125
Pieces like the ones
I've just described...

511
00:54:31,375 --> 00:54:33,958
...have been stolen
by criminals...

512
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:38,791
...probably linked to cultural
trafficking rings...

513
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:42,250
...that threaten every
museum in the world.

514
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:46,500
The National Institute of
Anthropology and History...

515
00:54:46,791 --> 00:54:53,583
...warns Mexico of these thieves,
enemies of their past and heritage.

516
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:57,833
All Mexicans are called upon
to rally against...

517
00:54:58,166 --> 00:55:01,250
...this act of shameful,
unpatriotic theft.

518
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,791
It's been one thing after
another, what a year!

519
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:09,458
How do you steal so many pieces?
Where were the guards?

520
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:13,833
- Culture's budget keeps being cut.
- Will you let me hear?

521
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:23,333
The value of these pieces is
inestimable in monetary terms.

522
00:55:24,125 --> 00:55:29,000
Rather, their value is
cultural and artistic.

523
00:55:30,041 --> 00:55:32,166
In other news, earthquake rescue crews...

524
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,541
Turn it off.

525
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:38,416
- They didn't say their worth.
- They did, they're priceless.

526
00:55:38,875 --> 00:55:42,291
- You can't put a price on them.
- They don't know how.

527
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:48,208
How could they know?
It's our history.

528
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:54,208
Our heritage, our culture,
that's their only value.

529
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:58,291
Those who did it are miserable
bastards with no past or future.

530
00:55:58,541 --> 00:56:02,375
I hope they rot in their own
curse, their own stupidity.

531
00:56:03,375 --> 00:56:05,750
They are the dark shit
of this country.

532
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:11,166
When they catch them,
it is our solemn duty...

533
00:56:11,416 --> 00:56:13,833
...to whip them
in the main square.

534
00:56:14,083 --> 00:56:18,375
And drag their damned bodies
until they bleed out.

535
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,750
Sons of bitches!

536
00:56:28,583 --> 00:56:30,166
What's wrong, Mom?

537
00:56:30,416 --> 00:56:31,958
- Nothing.
- Are you crying?

538
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:33,500
No, no.

539
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:36,875
- What's wrong?
- Don't listen to him.

540
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:52,833
Come on, Wilson, they need to look
presentable if we want to sell them.

541
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:55,583
They weren't presentable
at the museum?

542
00:56:57,958 --> 00:57:00,333
We need to fence them now.

543
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,458
Are you scared?

544
00:57:04,166 --> 00:57:08,333
- Should we give them back?
- No, otherwise it's all wasted.

545
00:57:10,708 --> 00:57:13,708
What if we go back
to the museum...

546
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:17,791
...and leave them at the coat check?
No one would notice.

547
00:57:18,041 --> 00:57:20,041
What are we, clowns?

548
00:57:22,041 --> 00:57:25,333
We'll take them to Bosco,
in Palenque, like we agreed...

549
00:57:25,583 --> 00:57:29,583
...and he'll take us
to his client, that's it.

550
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:31,791
- That's it?
- Yes.

551
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:38,750
Juan thought about all the small gods
we had hidden in his closet.

552
00:57:40,208 --> 00:57:42,166
Where are they now?

553
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:46,125
Do they still listen
to people's prayers?

554
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:50,375
Or did they leave them to their fate,
like they did to us?

555
00:57:51,291 --> 00:57:55,500
Who were those men
who crafted those gods?

556
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:58,666
What was their life like?

557
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,083
And what would they think
about the way I live?

558
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:16,583
Juan! Wake up.

559
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:18,583
What?

560
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:35,125
Turn off the engine.

561
00:58:36,666 --> 00:58:37,875
Where are you headed?

562
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:39,583
- Nowhere.
- Palenque.

563
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,333
Do you have ID?

564
00:58:42,833 --> 00:58:44,541
Show it to me.

565
00:58:57,625 --> 00:58:59,875
- Are you carrying marijuana?
- No.

566
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:04,125
- I wasn't talking to you, whitey.
- No.

567
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,958
Get out, we're searching the car.

568
00:59:16,541 --> 00:59:18,291
Go stand over there.

569
00:59:20,541 --> 00:59:22,125
Check everywhere.

570
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:30,875
What's in that bag?

571
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:39,791
Sergeant.

572
00:59:58,416 --> 01:00:00,625
Do you collect handcrafts?

573
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:02,750
Yes.

574
01:00:04,666 --> 01:00:06,500
You look familiar.

575
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,333
You're a famous actor,
aren't you?

576
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:12,750
Of course you are!

577
01:00:13,791 --> 01:00:16,458
Can I get an autograph
for my girlfriend?

578
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:19,541
Sure.

579
01:00:32,916 --> 01:00:36,625
[speaking Mayan]

580
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:36,750
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

581
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:39,458
Sit down, go on.

582
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:46,541
- Good morning.
- How are you?

583
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:48,958
Hi, I'm Juan.

584
01:01:49,375 --> 01:01:51,958
- Benjamin, from Satelite.
- Nice to meet you.

585
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:55,416
Do you know a guide here
named Bosco Huerta?

586
01:01:56,791 --> 01:01:58,458
- No?
- How about "Chunuc"?

587
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:00,958
Ah! Yes, we know him.

588
01:02:01,541 --> 01:02:05,458
- He was there earlier with a group.
- Who the hell is Chunuc?

589
01:02:06,708 --> 01:02:09,833
When Pakal died at the age of 80...

590
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:12,416
...his sons, led by the priest...

591
01:02:12,708 --> 01:02:15,375
...descended these stairways
inside the building...

592
01:02:15,708 --> 01:02:18,291
...with torches, bearing his corpse.

593
01:02:18,625 --> 01:02:23,791
Symbolically traveling down
the nine levels of the underworld.

594
01:02:24,416 --> 01:02:29,333
In 1952, when the master Alberto Ruz...

595
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:33,250
...the Mexican archaeologist,
found the tomb, they--

596
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:43,541
I'm sorry.

597
01:02:44,416 --> 01:02:46,458
Excuse me, mister, but...

598
01:02:46,791 --> 01:02:49,916
...you know, this group is complete
and already paid for.

599
01:02:51,791 --> 01:02:54,125
- Do you mind?
- We don't mind.

600
01:02:54,666 --> 01:02:56,833
- They don't mind.
- OK.

601
01:02:57,333 --> 01:02:58,875
Thank you. So...

602
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:03,125
...all the body of Pakal was spread
with cinnabar red.

603
01:03:03,541 --> 01:03:05,833
- Because of the sunrise. Because--
- It was the color--

604
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:09,208
- The sun comes out, it's red.
- The color of the sunrise.

605
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:12,666
- In the east.
- Yes, that's it, the sunrise.

606
01:03:13,125 --> 01:03:16,708
So, we have an expert here, right?

607
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:19,041
Thank you, mister.

608
01:03:19,916 --> 01:03:24,083
The first archaeologists
tried to figure out...

609
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:28,458
...how this tomb was
get inside this pyramid.

610
01:03:28,916 --> 01:03:32,791
Until they realized
that was first the tomb...

611
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:37,750
...and they build the pyramid
over the tomb, the sarcophagus.

612
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:42,208
OK, so...

613
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,583
...ladies and gentlemen,
here we are...

614
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:49,875
...in the tomb of Pakal.

615
01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:56,916
Pakal's body was
with different kind of jewels...

616
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,250
...each one with a different meaning,
and to crown it all...

617
01:04:01,625 --> 01:04:04,625
...a beautiful jade mask
covering his face...

618
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,625
...immortalizing his features forever.

619
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:11,125
- From the museum in Mexico City.
- Yes, that's right.

620
01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:15,041
This is the same mask that was stolen
from the Anthropology Museum...

621
01:04:15,375 --> 01:04:18,041
...last week by cowards.

622
01:04:18,416 --> 01:04:21,500
Isn't the sarcophagus
supposed to be a spaceship?

623
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:23,708
Yes... Yes, yes.

624
01:04:24,291 --> 01:04:27,083
- There is an interpretation.
- Yeah, you heard about that myth, right?

625
01:04:27,916 --> 01:04:32,916
There are some people telling that Pakal
was supposed to be steering a spaceship...

626
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:35,291
...instead of laying in the Tree of Life.

627
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:38,625
But, you know, only small
and stupid children believe that.

628
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,458
But we don't know.

629
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:44,083
Yeah, they say that
he is laying back in the rocket...

630
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:49,416
...like the NASA astronaut,
and all this full of levers and buttons.

631
01:04:49,791 --> 01:04:54,083
And now he's all set to go
and kill some space invaders. Right?

632
01:04:54,666 --> 01:04:57,541
Or like a cosmonaut.
We don't know.

633
01:04:58,083 --> 01:05:00,750
We can talk at the end of the tour
if you want.

634
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:02,416
OK, so let's continue, please.

635
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:06,708
Let's go to our next stop,
el conjunto Las Cruces.

636
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:10,375
Thank you. Watch your step.
Let's go to get some fresh air.

637
01:05:10,541 --> 01:05:13,375
Wait, Chunuc!
I'm talking to you.

638
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:16,333
- Wait.
- We need to talk.

639
01:05:17,041 --> 01:05:19,583
Unless you want to be
credited as the mastermind.

640
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:21,416
The what?

641
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:23,791
Me? The mastermind?

642
01:05:24,083 --> 01:05:26,333
I have nothing to do
with this.

643
01:05:27,458 --> 01:05:29,333
- You gave us the idea!
- Stop saying that.

644
01:05:29,666 --> 01:05:31,291
- You gave us the idea!
- Stop saying that.

645
01:05:31,583 --> 01:05:34,708
- You gave us the idea!
- Stop saying that!

646
01:05:34,958 --> 01:05:37,083
- For fuck's sake!
- Easy, Bosco.

647
01:05:37,416 --> 01:05:41,416
- Juan has it all under control.
- Fucking psycho, you too.

648
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:46,416
You said: "Do something else,
don't be like our parents."

649
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:52,208
- But this isn't what I meant!
- It's normal to be scared.

650
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:58,083
- My hands are so delicate!
- They need to be moist, soaking wet.

651
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:02,791
Is that Scherezada Rios?

652
01:06:03,208 --> 01:06:06,750
- That's a great movie.
- Juanito, I'm not helping you.

653
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,541
- I'm not joking.
- Chill, Bosco.

654
01:06:11,416 --> 01:06:13,125
Sit down, sit.

655
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:16,041
You still haven't contacted
Mr. Gray, I assume.

656
01:06:16,375 --> 01:06:19,041
- Graves.
- Well, look.

657
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:22,458
"Being a warrior is not
just about wishing it.

658
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:25,458
It is an endless,
lifelong struggle."

659
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:27,291
Yes, yes.

660
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:31,083
"No one is born a warrior,
no one is born a commoner.

661
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:35,416
It is we who become
one thing or the other."

662
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,500
Carlos Castaneda.

663
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:42,541
You can't use the master
to manipulate me.

664
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:45,333
That's a low blow,
even from you.

665
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:49,291
If you don't help us,
we'll go to Pepe Soto.

666
01:06:49,791 --> 01:06:51,041
He'll fence them.

667
01:06:51,416 --> 01:06:54,458
Go ahead, go to him.
You'll end up in jail...

668
01:06:54,708 --> 01:06:57,375
- ...right next to him.
- So will you.

669
01:06:57,791 --> 01:06:59,416
Me? In jail?

670
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:02,666
Pepe Soto
is the King Midas of shit.

671
01:07:02,916 --> 01:07:04,625
Everything he touches
turns to shit.

672
01:07:04,875 --> 01:07:06,416
Exactly.

673
01:07:06,708 --> 01:07:10,416
That's why we're here,
and not with him.

674
01:07:11,416 --> 01:07:14,791
- Get us in touch with Mr. Gray.
- Graves.

675
01:07:15,166 --> 01:07:17,916
That's right, Graves.
We'll do the rest.

676
01:07:18,166 --> 01:07:22,416
Even if I got ahold of him,
which I'm not doing...

677
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:26,083
...how will you talk him into
moving such hot pieces?

678
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,875
Hold this.

679
01:07:58,666 --> 01:08:00,708
It's fucking beautiful.

680
01:08:01,916 --> 01:08:04,291
- I know.
- Beautiful.

681
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:09,041
Are you going to help us?

682
01:08:17,916 --> 01:08:19,249
What?

683
01:08:20,624 --> 01:08:22,166
Nothing, man.

684
01:08:41,708 --> 01:08:46,749
"Death is our eternal companion"

685
01:08:47,249 --> 01:08:50,249
"Always to our left"

686
01:08:50,583 --> 01:08:55,624
"An arm's distance away"

687
01:08:59,874 --> 01:09:01,291
Fuck.

688
01:09:02,416 --> 01:09:03,958
Holy shit.

689
01:09:07,624 --> 01:09:10,916
So, what are you doing
with your share?

690
01:09:15,874 --> 01:09:18,333
Those were the best days.

691
01:09:22,124 --> 01:09:25,333
Sometimes, I even forgot
we had robbed the museum.

692
01:09:34,749 --> 01:09:39,208
I liked to imagine that
blah, blah, blah.

693
01:09:40,958 --> 01:09:43,874
"You felt its icy touch"

694
01:09:44,749 --> 01:09:50,458
"The way you felt it today"

695
01:09:51,874 --> 01:09:55,458
50 MILLION REWARD FOR HELP
RETRIEVING STOLEN ARTIFACTS

696
01:09:56,333 --> 01:09:59,958
By then, the INTERPOL
was already on the case.

697
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:04,750
They were looking for
the Museum thieves.

698
01:10:21,375 --> 01:10:24,791
Juan always quoted something
Hernan Cortes once said:

699
01:10:25,416 --> 01:10:29,416
"I came here looking for gold,
not to plow the earth like a peasant."

700
01:10:31,291 --> 01:10:36,000
He said he was finally
no longer afraid to die.

701
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:40,458
"Death is our eternal
companion...

702
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:46,208
Always behind us, to the left,
an arm's distance away.

703
01:10:48,416 --> 01:10:52,625
Death is the only wise advisor
a warrior can count on.

704
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:58,458
When the warrior feels
he's about to be killed...

705
01:10:59,333 --> 01:11:01,958
...he can turn to his death...

706
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,041
...and ask if it's true.

707
01:11:05,333 --> 01:11:08,000
His death will tell him
he's wrong.

708
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:12,458
That nothing matters,
except for its touch.

709
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:16,708
His death will say:
'I haven't touched you yet'."

710
01:12:23,125 --> 01:12:25,666
The Mayas who worked
near the pyramids told us...

711
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,916
...they often break in at night
to leave offerings for their dead.

712
01:12:32,458 --> 01:12:38,000
Site employees always clear them
to keep it neat for the tourists.

713
01:12:41,583 --> 01:12:44,333
I don't know for whom Juan's
offering was supposed to be.

714
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:47,708
I don't know if it was an offering,
or a way of apologizing...

715
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:49,625
...or some sort of reparation.

716
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:51,416
He never told me.

717
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:53,875
Juan.

718
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:55,750
Juan.

719
01:12:57,083 --> 01:12:58,333
Juan.

720
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:00,458
It's done.

721
01:13:03,041 --> 01:13:05,791
- Who?
- What do you mean "who"?

722
01:13:06,166 --> 01:13:08,291
Frank Graves called back.

723
01:13:08,541 --> 01:13:12,541
He wants to meet on Friday,
in Acapulco, we need to go.

724
01:13:28,375 --> 01:13:33,291
Security was doubled at airports,
naval ports, and train stations...

725
01:13:33,541 --> 01:13:35,500
...to keep the jewels
from being smuggled.

726
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:40,875
The Customs Office incorrectly
described the pieces to the outposts...

727
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:46,291
...claiming they were clay and stone,
when in fact they're gold and jade.

728
01:13:47,375 --> 01:13:51,125
So, I'm the Mexican contact
for Mr...

729
01:13:51,375 --> 01:13:53,583
- Mr. Quest.
- West.

730
01:13:53,833 --> 01:13:56,583
- Yeah, Quest.
- Not Quest, West. All right?

731
01:13:56,833 --> 01:14:01,333
Our boss, Mr. West has
businesses in the Caribbean.

732
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:04,791
- Let's not say that.
- No?

733
01:14:05,208 --> 01:14:07,166
- Don't say a word.
- OK.

734
01:14:07,416 --> 01:14:09,541
I'll do all the talking,
and when I signal...

735
01:14:09,958 --> 01:14:14,041
...you take out the bait.
He needs to savor it.

736
01:14:14,375 --> 01:14:16,541
- Those fuckers are like that.
- How?

737
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:19,083
Like that, like pedophiles.

738
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:25,541
And then can we go see
the cliff divers?

739
01:14:28,791 --> 01:14:31,916
- Aren't you dressing up?
- I did.

740
01:14:33,083 --> 01:14:37,333
What? No one told me we
had to dress like waiters.

741
01:15:13,083 --> 01:15:16,916
I have to go home,
my dad is in the hospital.

742
01:15:19,041 --> 01:15:20,791
Damn, Wilson.

743
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:23,083
That sucks.

744
01:15:23,916 --> 01:15:26,083
Let's finish this
and get back tomorrow.

745
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:28,458
My dad is in the hospital,
I'm leaving.

746
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:34,583
Tomorrow, you'll be able to afford
any hospital for your dad.

747
01:15:34,916 --> 01:15:37,541
Like Houston!
We'll get him there.

748
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:41,375
Think about it,
I'm only asking for one day.

749
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:45,875
- I can't, Juan.
- Don't do this to me, Wilson.

750
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:49,541
You can't abandon me,
you're my eagle commander!

751
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:52,083
- Damn it.
- I can't.

752
01:15:52,416 --> 01:15:53,833
Listen, you shit!

753
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:57,250
If you abandon me,
I'll never forgive you!

754
01:15:57,541 --> 01:15:58,791
Never!

755
01:16:01,333 --> 01:16:03,541
Goddammit, you bastard!

756
01:16:06,416 --> 01:16:08,458
Get in the fucking car!

757
01:16:42,875 --> 01:16:45,666
Wilson! Hey!
Come here.

758
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:48,500
- What's that?
- Home.

759
01:16:50,083 --> 01:16:52,291
- Right?
- Of course not.

760
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:54,833
It's Satelite, I'm telling you!

761
01:17:22,958 --> 01:17:24,916
I love Acapulco.

762
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,208
Gentlemen, good afternoon.

763
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:31,583
My apologies, I had guests.
Bosco, how are you, old boy?

764
01:17:31,666 --> 01:17:34,958
These are Omar Robles
and Francisco Muñoz.

765
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:41,083
- Hi. Hello, Mr. Graves.
- Frank, please.

766
01:17:41,458 --> 01:17:44,791
Nobody calls me Mr. Graves
except those fuckers from Hacienda.

767
01:17:45,166 --> 01:17:48,916
How exciting!
Shall we get down to it? Follow me.

768
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:50,500
Thank you, Frank.

769
01:17:50,625 --> 01:17:53,958
- Hey, Bosco! Come here.
- What, man?

770
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:55,500
- An Englishman?
- What?

771
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:58,125
We're giving the country's jewels
to a fucking Englishman?

772
01:17:58,333 --> 01:18:00,333
They'll end up in
the fucking British Museum.

773
01:18:00,625 --> 01:18:03,166
These fuckers don't care,
they don't even speak Spanish!

774
01:18:03,416 --> 01:18:04,708
- Follow me.
- Dude!

775
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,291
- What are you drinking, gentlemen?
- Whatever you have, Frank.

776
01:18:18,666 --> 01:18:20,625
You know? Una cuba for me is good.

777
01:18:20,708 --> 01:18:23,541
- I'd like a rum and coke, too.
- Make it three!

778
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:27,875
Cubas, for fuck's sake!
This is not the Baby'O, boys.

779
01:18:29,125 --> 01:18:31,291
Gin and tonics all around, I think.

780
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:37,291
Hey, Frankie, is this a new piece
from Tikal? 400 a.C., maybe?

781
01:18:38,625 --> 01:18:43,250
Classical period, yes. Very good.
You know your Maya, arqueólogo.

782
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:46,958
Well, what I know was that Tikal
was sacked by the gringos and you Brits...

783
01:18:47,416 --> 01:18:49,041
...when they went in to restore it.

784
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:52,666
Well, after the Krauts had already taken
every Pre-Hispanic piece off site.

785
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:54,833
It's not "Pre-Hispanic."

786
01:18:56,458 --> 01:18:57,583
What should I say?

787
01:18:57,666 --> 01:19:01,500
Mesoamerican or Maya,
which is what they are.

788
01:19:03,208 --> 01:19:07,125
Cheers, gentlemen.
To Mesoamerica.

789
01:19:08,916 --> 01:19:12,500
Well, you know, every piece from Tikal
that are worth anything...

790
01:19:12,875 --> 01:19:14,333
...are now in private collections...

791
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:17,166
...where nobody can see them
but the friends of the owners.

792
01:19:17,625 --> 01:19:20,208
Still doing your Indiana Jones bit,
Bosquito?

793
01:19:20,291 --> 01:19:21,833
"This stuff belongs in a museum."

794
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:27,125
And are you still doing
your Belzoni bit, Frankie?

795
01:19:27,458 --> 01:19:29,125
You love it, right?

796
01:19:29,333 --> 01:19:32,041
Ever heard of Belzoni?
Giovanni Belzoni?

797
01:19:32,333 --> 01:19:36,250
He was an eccentric Italian,
a 19th century explorer.

798
01:19:36,666 --> 01:19:42,666
In his London strongman shows
he'd lift 20 people at once.

799
01:19:43,166 --> 01:19:45,833
Absolute lunatic, but he was responsible
for finding...

800
01:19:45,916 --> 01:19:48,166
...some of the most important sites
in Ancient Egypt.

801
01:19:48,958 --> 01:19:51,833
The Abu Simbel temple, Seti I's tomb,
to name but a few.

802
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:54,708
Yes, and he kept half of what he found.

803
01:19:55,041 --> 01:20:00,083
And whatever he didn't stole for himself,
he selled it like it was his own.

804
01:20:00,625 --> 01:20:04,875
And that's how the Met, the Louvre
and your British Museum were made.

805
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:09,250
That's how all museums were made,
even your Anthropology Museum.

806
01:20:09,833 --> 01:20:12,166
Where do you think they got
that Tlaloc monolith from?

807
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:14,291
Do you think someone donated it
out of the kindness of their heart?

808
01:20:14,666 --> 01:20:18,750
Well, Frank, that rock is not Tlaloc,
this is actually Chalchiuhtlicue.

809
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:20,666
They stole it.

810
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:23,250
Yes, Frank, I was there.

811
01:20:24,375 --> 01:20:27,833
That's my point. Without people like
Belzoni there wouldn't be any archaeology.

812
01:20:28,916 --> 01:20:30,541
There wouldn't be anything.

813
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:33,041
"There's no preservation
without plunder."

814
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:35,833
You of all people should know that,
arqueólogo.

815
01:20:36,291 --> 01:20:39,125
Yeah, that's what
every thief in history says.

816
01:20:40,041 --> 01:20:41,291
Yes, maybe.

817
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:44,541
Let me show you something.

818
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:54,791
Page 20 or something.

819
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:59,875
Last year, an American expedition
discovered a Spanish galleon...

820
01:21:00,541 --> 01:21:02,250
...in international waters.

821
01:21:02,333 --> 01:21:07,250
She'd been sunk by the British in 1804,
a beautiful, beautiful vessel.

822
01:21:08,791 --> 01:21:13,583
And inside this ship, they found gold,
valued at an estimated...

823
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:19,291
...$500 million,
that's half a billion greens.

824
01:21:20,541 --> 01:21:23,541
So, saying that it was
part of their national heritage...

825
01:21:23,625 --> 01:21:25,166
...or whatever the fuck they called it...

826
01:21:25,666 --> 01:21:28,250
...the Spanish government
claimed the vessel as their property...

827
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:30,750
...and sued the Americans.

828
01:21:30,958 --> 01:21:33,458
Well, the Yanks, quite naturally, said...

829
01:21:33,541 --> 01:21:35,458
"What the fuck are you talking about?
We found this shit."

830
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:38,916
And then the government of Peru
stuck their noses in.

831
01:21:39,166 --> 01:21:43,458
Wasn't the gold which was being carried by
the Spanish galleon originally Inca gold?

832
01:21:43,791 --> 01:21:46,833
In which case,
shouldn't it go back to Peru...

833
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:52,041
...from where those conquistador bastards
stole it in the first place?

834
01:21:52,416 --> 01:21:53,833
Yes, I'd think that's obvious.

835
01:21:54,208 --> 01:21:58,250
Yes, but who had paid for the
very expensive underwater expedition...

836
01:21:58,333 --> 01:22:03,083
...without which there wouldn't be
any galleon, or any Inca gold...

837
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:06,416
...or anything to argue about?

838
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:10,583
It's not so simple, is it?

839
01:22:13,416 --> 01:22:16,666
Anyway, you didn't come here to hear me
rattle on about Spanish galleons.

840
01:22:17,208 --> 01:22:20,166
Bosco here says you have
something very special...

841
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:22,416
...and he's never disappointed me, so...

842
01:22:24,291 --> 01:22:25,458
Yes.

843
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:29,083
Thank you, Frank, for receiving us.

844
01:22:29,958 --> 01:22:34,333
Me and Alan,
we are very happy to be here...

845
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:39,708
...representing the interests of Mr. West.
Mr. West operates mainly in the Caribbean.

846
01:22:41,541 --> 01:22:44,791
Mr. West cares deeply
about where his goods will end up...

847
01:22:45,083 --> 01:22:47,250
...so he will be more than happy...

848
01:22:47,333 --> 01:22:50,208
...if all the things that we come
to present end up in your hands.

849
01:22:51,125 --> 01:22:52,958
- Mr. West--
- Why?

850
01:22:57,083 --> 01:22:59,291
Why would he be happy?

851
01:23:02,875 --> 01:23:07,500
Because you... It's you.
You have a very good eye.

852
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:12,458
And with all your collection
and what we brought...

853
01:23:13,125 --> 01:23:17,083
...you can have someone like architect
Ramírez Vázquez build you your own museum.

854
01:23:20,166 --> 01:23:23,125
Mr. West would like to...

855
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:27,666
Normally, you know,
he would scatter these pieces around...

856
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:30,083
...with his clients in the Caribbean
to minimize the risk.

857
01:23:30,958 --> 01:23:34,416
But this time he's willing to
take the risk and offer the whole lot...

858
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:39,125
...140 pieces, intact, to only one buyer.

859
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,083
Especially one that appreciates
what he's getting.

860
01:23:43,791 --> 01:23:45,125
Alan?

861
01:25:07,416 --> 01:25:12,166
Frank, our boss, Mr. Quest
is involved in heists...

862
01:25:12,416 --> 01:25:14,750
...at the most prominent
museums in the world.

863
01:25:15,041 --> 01:25:18,500
Europe, Asia, Africa,
the United States.

864
01:25:19,083 --> 01:25:23,666
So don't be scared, Frank.
Mr. Quest is a professional.

865
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:26,916
How much?

866
01:25:28,375 --> 01:25:31,333
For the mask?
No, no, he wants to sell the whole lot.

867
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,458
Okay, how much for the whole lot?

868
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,583
- Mr. West is asking for $1 million.
- West or Quest? I'm confused.

869
01:25:37,916 --> 01:25:39,666
West, West! West.

870
01:25:41,041 --> 01:25:45,416
Mr. West wants a million?
And how did he come up with that figure?

871
01:25:48,708 --> 01:25:50,583
You know, what I find
really fascinating is...

872
01:25:50,666 --> 01:25:54,125
...who would choose you two kids
to try and make this deal.

873
01:25:54,208 --> 01:25:55,625
What do you mean?

874
01:25:56,375 --> 01:25:59,666
You've got some fucking balls, my friends,
I'll give you that...

875
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:01,166
...coming in here
trying to pull this stunt.

876
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:03,375
And you, you're gonna hear from me,
Bosquito.

877
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:06,416
Hey, Frank. No, no, listen to me.
I was just do the introduction.

878
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:07,666
This is not my business.

879
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:09,375
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

880
01:26:09,458 --> 01:26:10,583
Frank!

881
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:14,500
If you think this mask is fake, then
you know nothing about Mesoamerican art.

882
01:26:14,583 --> 01:26:16,041
I know every art dealer there is.

883
01:26:16,125 --> 01:26:18,250
I know you don't have a boss called
Mr. West or Mr. Quest...

884
01:26:18,333 --> 01:26:19,458
...or whatever the fuck you call him.

885
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:22,833
And I know you got that suit
in Suburbia just before coming here.

886
01:26:22,916 --> 01:26:24,250
You're no dealer, kid.

887
01:26:24,583 --> 01:26:27,833
These are the real pieces that were stolen
from the Museum of Anthropology.

888
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:30,541
- I know!
- Yes, test them, test them.

889
01:26:30,625 --> 01:26:33,291
I know that's the real mask of King Pakal,
there's nothing else like it in the world.

890
01:26:33,375 --> 01:26:36,125
But listen to me, you can't sell this.

891
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:41,333
Nobody can. Nobody in this business
is stupid enough to buy it.

892
01:26:42,583 --> 01:26:43,875
You understand?

893
01:26:50,208 --> 01:26:53,416
- OK, let's sell it for half a million--
- No, look at me. Look at me!

894
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,750
These pieces are unsellable.

895
01:26:59,250 --> 01:27:01,375
They might as well be worthless.

896
01:27:08,041 --> 01:27:09,708
Oh, you're boys.

897
01:27:11,875 --> 01:27:15,250
You look like good boys, you're not
crooks. Now, if you'll excuse me...

898
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,208
...I need to get back to my guests.

899
01:27:19,583 --> 01:27:22,666
Frank, maybe you heard
this other story.

900
01:27:23,875 --> 01:27:27,250
Rockefeller's plane was so heavy
from all the Maya stelae...

901
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:30,916
...they had stolen from us,
that it couldn't take off!

902
01:27:31,541 --> 01:27:32,833
And what is that to me?

903
01:27:33,041 --> 01:27:35,416
The law is strict when it comes
to archaeology, right?

904
01:27:35,666 --> 01:27:37,416
Especially on foreigners.

905
01:27:37,708 --> 01:27:40,500
All my stuff is completely legal.

906
01:27:40,875 --> 01:27:43,041
People at the Instituto Nacional
have my back...

907
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:45,291
...people, by the way, who'd be
very happy to recover this treasure.

908
01:27:45,375 --> 01:27:47,125
They're fucking thieves,
like you.

909
01:27:47,208 --> 01:27:49,500
All it takes is one phone call.

910
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:59,458
Look, if I were you, I'd...
I'd fly away tonight.

911
01:28:01,416 --> 01:28:03,291
They're gonna come after you.

912
01:28:05,458 --> 01:28:07,625
Just fly the fuck away.

913
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:17,125
Are we going back
to Mexico City?

914
01:28:17,541 --> 01:28:19,666
I need to check up
on my dad.

915
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:23,625
Juan!

916
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,250
Juan!

917
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:33,500
One of these.

918
01:28:37,375 --> 01:28:39,208
What did she say?

919
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:43,333
Hello?

920
01:29:04,875 --> 01:29:06,750
- Hello?
- Chiva.

921
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,000
- Where are you, idiot?
- Chiva, I need your help.

922
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:11,583
Dad's going to kill you.

923
01:29:11,666 --> 01:29:13,041
Is he angry?

924
01:29:13,125 --> 01:29:15,500
He reported the car as stolen.
Where are you, idiot?

925
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:17,125
But it wasn't stolen!

926
01:29:17,208 --> 01:29:20,000
It's stolen, even if we know
who has the car.

927
01:29:20,083 --> 01:29:24,833
I need to know the name of
Pepe Soto's club in Acapulco.

928
01:29:25,125 --> 01:29:26,125
Why, you idiot?

929
01:29:26,208 --> 01:29:27,916
Stop calling me idiot,
you hag!

930
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,250
What's the name
of the club in Acapulco?

931
01:29:30,333 --> 01:29:32,375
What are you doing
in Acapulco, idiot?

932
01:29:32,458 --> 01:29:33,708
I'm not!

933
01:29:33,791 --> 01:29:34,916
What makes you think
I'm there?

934
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,541
"What makes you think I'm there?"

935
01:29:37,208 --> 01:29:39,250
Dad is gonna castrate you
when he sees you.

936
01:29:39,333 --> 01:29:41,500
Just give me the name!

937
01:29:43,666 --> 01:29:44,833
Heaven's Gates.

938
01:29:44,916 --> 01:29:46,875
Got it. Thanks, hag.

939
01:29:46,958 --> 01:29:49,875
You're the only one of the four
I like, don't tell anyone.

940
01:30:01,708 --> 01:30:05,041
Visiting hours at the hospital
start at eight o'clock.

941
01:30:10,208 --> 01:30:11,708
Juan?

942
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:15,666
Juan.

943
01:30:20,583 --> 01:30:24,041
How will we get there
if you don't know where it is?

944
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:28,750
Remember the book
Journey to Ixtlan?

945
01:30:29,541 --> 01:30:31,125
The Castaneda one?

946
01:30:32,041 --> 01:30:35,708
Remember when Don Juan
shows them how to stop the world?

947
01:30:41,583 --> 01:30:43,375
Don't do that, Juan.

948
01:30:45,458 --> 01:30:46,666
Don't worry.

949
01:30:48,875 --> 01:30:51,750
Don't worry, It's all good.
Just be chill.

950
01:30:52,416 --> 01:30:54,375
- Juan!
- Just breathe.

951
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:58,458
Go with the flow, man.
Just breathe.

952
01:31:00,958 --> 01:31:02,916
We'll be with Pepe soon.

953
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:06,500
We'll get an advance for the pieces
and we'll go back home.

954
01:31:07,333 --> 01:31:08,583
Turn on the lights!

955
01:31:09,083 --> 01:31:11,750
Holy shit! Oh, fuck!
You fucking asshole!

956
01:31:12,041 --> 01:31:14,208
He hit us, asshole!
Turn them on!

957
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,541
Stop the car, asshole!

958
01:31:17,041 --> 01:31:19,416
- Turn on the lights!
- There, there.

959
01:31:19,791 --> 01:31:22,500
- Pull over now! Pull over!
- What for?

960
01:31:22,750 --> 01:31:24,000
Stop the car.

961
01:31:24,291 --> 01:31:27,750
Where are you going?
Where are you going, idiot?

962
01:31:29,125 --> 01:31:30,708
What are you doing?

963
01:31:31,375 --> 01:31:34,166
- Where are you going?
- Fuck you, to Mexico!

964
01:31:34,416 --> 01:31:37,125
- Get back here.
- Stop it!

965
01:31:37,708 --> 01:31:41,166
Don't start with this!
You'll end up crying.

966
01:31:42,666 --> 01:31:45,625
I'm done following you.
I'm done!

967
01:31:46,583 --> 01:31:48,958
Without me, you're just
a stupid dog groomer...

968
01:31:49,208 --> 01:31:51,666
...who wipes his dad's asshole!

969
01:32:03,083 --> 01:32:04,875
Listen, you piece of shit.

970
01:32:08,125 --> 01:32:13,000
I took the blame when you nearly
blinded Toño Juarez, remember?

971
01:32:13,291 --> 01:32:16,166
They would've put you
in a mental hospital!

972
01:32:17,833 --> 01:32:20,708
I'm your only friend!
Do you understand?

973
01:32:21,583 --> 01:32:23,333
Let go of me!

974
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:27,958
Will you be calm?

975
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:30,041
Will you be calm?

976
01:32:30,750 --> 01:32:32,791
Let go of me, asshole!

977
01:32:46,375 --> 01:32:48,333
Fuck off, dead-weight!

978
01:32:48,625 --> 01:32:50,750
I'm better off without you!

979
01:32:57,750 --> 01:33:01,000
START THE ACTION
AT THE SEA!

980
01:33:22,375 --> 01:33:25,000
- We should've studied music.
- You think?

981
01:33:25,375 --> 01:33:28,833
We'd have a kick ass band,
and we'd leave this place.

982
01:33:29,125 --> 01:33:30,875
Floyd didn’t study music.

983
01:33:31,166 --> 01:33:33,791
Floyd's not one person,
it's four.

984
01:33:34,083 --> 01:33:38,500
- I mean, you don't need to study.
- Or say dumb shit every time.

985
01:33:38,916 --> 01:33:41,500
To leave this place, I mean.

986
01:33:42,541 --> 01:33:44,541
- Bowie.
- He did study.

987
01:33:44,791 --> 01:33:47,083
That guy did study music.

988
01:33:48,875 --> 01:33:51,416
Haven't we gone through
this place before?

989
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:53,750
- Obviously.
- Where are we going?

990
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,916
We're just driving around.
You got somewhere to be?

991
01:33:57,458 --> 01:34:00,375
- That's the point of driving around.
- Passing the same place over and over?

992
01:34:00,666 --> 01:34:03,333
- That's Satelite-folk's problem.
- That they go in circles?

993
01:34:03,583 --> 01:34:05,333
That they can't enjoy life.

994
01:34:05,625 --> 01:34:08,000
- And you?
- Me? I try to.

995
01:34:08,291 --> 01:34:10,625
- I mean are you Satelite-folk?
- No.

996
01:34:10,875 --> 01:34:15,708
- What are they like, then?
- They're so tired from work...

997
01:34:16,041 --> 01:34:18,708
...they'd rather watch TV
than be with their family.

998
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,916
What's on TV tires them,
so they go to bed more tired.

999
01:34:23,208 --> 01:34:27,916
Their dreams tire them, too.
They look like crap, so tired.

1000
01:34:28,916 --> 01:34:32,625
And one day, just like that,
they die from exhaustion.

1001
01:34:32,916 --> 01:34:34,541
What if you stop
turning the wheel?

1002
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:37,208
- We stop going in circles.
- We go in a straight line.

1003
01:34:37,458 --> 01:34:40,291
- We crash into the light post.
- And we die.

1004
01:34:41,458 --> 01:34:45,666
Then we wake up and realize
we're still driving in circles.

1005
01:34:52,708 --> 01:34:56,291
Or... we could do
something different.

1006
01:34:57,125 --> 01:34:58,750
Like what?

1007
01:34:59,791 --> 01:35:01,750
Like nicking something.

1008
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,541
Nicking something?
You mean stealing?

1009
01:35:05,833 --> 01:35:08,583
- Why not?
- Why yes?

1010
01:35:10,541 --> 01:35:14,833
Because I'm sick of waiting for
something to happen, aren't you?

1011
01:35:15,416 --> 01:35:18,166
Would stealing make
something happen?

1012
01:35:19,541 --> 01:35:21,375
Do you have a better idea?

1013
01:35:23,083 --> 01:35:24,916
That's what I thought.

1014
01:35:26,333 --> 01:35:28,708
So, what would we nick?
This car?

1015
01:35:28,958 --> 01:35:32,458
No way! This car belongs
to my family.

1016
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:36,125
- So, what then?
- We'll figure it out later.

1017
01:35:45,666 --> 01:35:47,291
Excuse me!

1018
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,625
Good evening!

1019
01:35:50,083 --> 01:35:52,708
Do you know a place called
Heaven's Gates?

1020
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:58,166
- Excuse me?
- Heaven's Gates?

1021
01:35:59,416 --> 01:36:02,750
Heaven's gates
are closed to you.

1022
01:36:06,333 --> 01:36:07,875
Just kidding!

1023
01:36:08,125 --> 01:36:10,708
Heaven's Gates
is that way!

1024
01:36:11,875 --> 01:36:14,000
- Thank you!
- You got it.

1025
01:37:56,291 --> 01:38:00,041
HEAVEN'S GATES

1026
01:38:22,541 --> 01:38:24,500
That's Scherezada, right?

1027
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,583
- From the movies?
- What else can I get you?

1028
01:38:27,833 --> 01:38:30,291
It's her, right?
It has to be.

1029
01:38:32,791 --> 01:38:35,083
Hey, man. Come here.

1030
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:42,375
Tell Pepe Soto that Lazy Juan
is here for him.

1031
01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:47,125
I don't know him.

1032
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:49,708
Pepe Soto.

1033
01:38:49,958 --> 01:38:52,708
That guy right there.
Your boss.

1034
01:38:53,708 --> 01:38:57,791
That guy hasn't been
around here in a while.

1035
01:39:02,166 --> 01:39:05,583
- Anything else?
- Can I have my money back?

1036
01:39:24,333 --> 01:39:27,000
Yeah, shake it, come here.

1037
01:39:30,708 --> 01:39:33,166
Come jingle those coins
in my face!

1038
01:39:40,833 --> 01:39:44,833
Where are you going?
Come dance with me!

1039
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
- Leave her alone!
- Old hag!

1040
01:39:49,291 --> 01:39:53,250
- Respect the artist!
- Go look after your grandkids, bitch!

1041
01:39:57,541 --> 01:40:01,125
Why are you dancing here
if you're gonna be a bitch about it?

1042
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:07,541
- Is this how you treat your sisters?
- Mind your fucking business.

1043
01:40:07,833 --> 01:40:10,375
- Apologize to her.
- Fuck you.

1044
01:40:10,916 --> 01:40:13,250
And now, a fight.

1045
01:41:03,083 --> 01:41:04,791
Enough, assholes.

1046
01:41:06,708 --> 01:41:09,583
Here is your fucking
white knight, Eugenia.

1047
01:41:11,333 --> 01:41:14,583
Take him out the back,
or they'll kill him.

1048
01:41:18,708 --> 01:41:20,166
Wait, my bag.

1049
01:41:20,708 --> 01:41:22,541
My bag, my bag!

1050
01:41:23,458 --> 01:41:27,166
- Hey, where's my bag?
- It's here, kid.

1051
01:41:29,625 --> 01:41:33,083
Listen, you can't come here
and get into a fight...

1052
01:41:33,458 --> 01:41:36,000
...and think that nothing
will happen to you.

1053
01:41:36,708 --> 01:41:40,458
It's not a soap opera set,
this is the state of Guerrero.

1054
01:41:41,708 --> 01:41:44,000
They disrespected you,
Scherezada.

1055
01:41:44,375 --> 01:41:47,250
That's so nice.
What a moron!

1056
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:51,833
Why do you play the hero?
You're too small for that.

1057
01:41:52,833 --> 01:41:57,166
- Why aren't you at a club?
- Scherezada Rios is not there.

1058
01:41:57,458 --> 01:42:01,125
Don't call me that.
My name is Eugenia.

1059
01:42:01,375 --> 01:42:04,166
- Eugenia?
- Yeah.

1060
01:42:04,458 --> 01:42:05,958
I had no idea.

1061
01:42:06,458 --> 01:42:09,500
Don't worry about it,
why would you know?

1062
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:13,666
I've seen The Hard Life of an
Easy Woman a million times.

1063
01:42:13,875 --> 01:42:15,666
Another fan.

1064
01:42:16,541 --> 01:42:18,666
Yeah, so what?

1065
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:23,708
- I hear you're looking for Pepe.
- Yes.

1066
01:42:25,625 --> 01:42:27,583
Pepe died last year.

1067
01:42:28,375 --> 01:42:30,000
What?

1068
01:42:31,541 --> 01:42:33,750
Yeah, he was killed.

1069
01:42:39,125 --> 01:42:40,916
Fuck.

1070
01:42:41,583 --> 01:42:43,958
It'll be six months now.

1071
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:47,916
He owed a lot of money.

1072
01:42:49,333 --> 01:42:52,500
He was mixed up in things,
way above his head.

1073
01:42:53,791 --> 01:42:56,791
- What did you want with him?
- Help.

1074
01:42:57,666 --> 01:42:58,916
From Pepe?

1075
01:42:59,166 --> 01:43:02,791
You must be in deep shit
if you need help from Pepe.

1076
01:43:07,166 --> 01:43:09,375
- Can I use your phone?
- Sure.

1077
01:43:14,125 --> 01:43:16,375
50 MILLION REWARD FOR HELP
RETRIEVING STOLEN ARTIFACTS

1078
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:31,750
Do you sell handcrafts?

1079
01:43:35,416 --> 01:43:37,208
They're not handcrafts.

1080
01:43:43,708 --> 01:43:46,708
The stuff inside that bag
is worth millions of dollars...

1081
01:43:47,958 --> 01:43:50,166
...and nothing at all.

1082
01:44:22,125 --> 01:44:23,875
When he was alive...

1083
01:44:25,083 --> 01:44:27,208
...this place was the best.

1084
01:44:27,875 --> 01:44:32,833
It was the best one.
People fought to get in.

1085
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:37,500
Say that again.

1086
01:44:38,250 --> 01:44:41,208
People fought to get in.

1087
01:44:41,458 --> 01:44:42,583
What?

1088
01:44:43,041 --> 01:44:45,333
I said people fought to get in.

1089
01:44:46,291 --> 01:44:48,041
People fought to get in.

1090
01:44:48,833 --> 01:44:49,958
What?

1091
01:44:55,833 --> 01:44:56,833
My love!

1092
01:44:59,166 --> 01:45:01,958
Wait, I have an idea!
Know what a zarahuato is?

1093
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:04,666
- No.
- A monkey that goes like this.

1094
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:10,041
That's right,
now a bit of this.

1095
01:45:10,416 --> 01:45:11,583
There we go.

1096
01:45:14,625 --> 01:45:17,833
Wait, wait! Like a monkey!

1097
01:45:22,666 --> 01:45:25,250
Yes, Scherezada.

1098
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:27,708
Schere...

1099
01:45:28,208 --> 01:45:31,041
Honestly, I've dreamt of you
after every one of your movies.

1100
01:45:31,583 --> 01:45:38,541
I have dedicated so many
nighttime thoughts to you.

1101
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,833
No, I won't tell you what I did.
What's the point?

1102
01:45:47,458 --> 01:45:50,625
Yeah, that's right.
Dance for me.

1103
01:46:57,125 --> 01:47:01,541
Good morning!
Have you seen a red bag?

1104
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:05,750
Are you sure?
A red bag around here?

1105
01:47:22,416 --> 01:47:25,166
I'm a fucking idiot!

1106
01:47:39,208 --> 01:47:41,666
I'm so stupid!

1107
01:47:42,125 --> 01:47:44,166
What a fucking idiot!

1108
01:48:09,166 --> 01:48:15,000
I get dizzy thinking about how close
those pieces came to being lost forever.

1109
01:48:15,416 --> 01:48:20,875
I think of all the things that might've
disappeared without anyone knowing.

1110
01:48:21,291 --> 01:48:24,041
All the things that
could have never been.

1111
01:48:24,291 --> 01:48:27,291
And yet, there they are.

1112
01:48:29,333 --> 01:48:32,791
One time, we crashed the car
and Juan's dad confessed...

1113
01:48:33,041 --> 01:48:36,625
...how close they came
to having him aborted.

1114
01:48:37,041 --> 01:48:40,000
Juan always said he wished
they had done it.

1115
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:02,958
What do you think
they're arguing about?

1116
01:49:08,125 --> 01:49:10,041
Who jumps last.

1117
01:49:10,750 --> 01:49:13,041
He gets the best tips.

1118
01:49:21,166 --> 01:49:23,500
We have to hide, Wilson.

1119
01:49:27,166 --> 01:49:29,125
We can't stay here.

1120
01:49:34,875 --> 01:49:36,958
Are you listening to me?

1121
01:49:42,333 --> 01:49:44,375
My father died.

1122
01:49:46,750 --> 01:49:49,333
- No!
- And I wasn't there for him.

1123
01:50:00,750 --> 01:50:02,333
Benjamin...

1124
01:50:04,541 --> 01:50:06,583
...I'm so sorry.

1125
01:50:09,083 --> 01:50:11,291
I'm truly sorry.

1126
01:50:18,291 --> 01:50:20,500
And Pepe Soto?

1127
01:50:21,708 --> 01:50:23,791
I couldn't find him.

1128
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:30,583
Where would we go?

1129
01:50:33,708 --> 01:50:36,333
We'd disappear for a while.

1130
01:50:39,125 --> 01:50:41,000
And the pieces?

1131
01:50:41,791 --> 01:50:44,750
They'll disappear
along with us.

1132
01:52:11,333 --> 01:52:12,666
Dad.

1133
01:52:15,833 --> 01:52:17,166
Mom.

1134
01:52:19,250 --> 01:52:20,583
Dad?

1135
01:52:24,125 --> 01:52:25,875
I'm leaving.

1136
01:52:30,083 --> 01:52:33,125
- Where were you?
- What are you doing, son?

1137
01:52:34,541 --> 01:52:36,916
Where have you been?
Are you OK?

1138
01:52:39,875 --> 01:52:41,916
I'm leaving, Mom.

1139
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:46,083
- I just wanted to say goodbye.
- They're looking for you.

1140
01:52:46,958 --> 01:52:49,666
The police were here
a few times.

1141
01:52:50,416 --> 01:52:54,041
- Where were you?
- What did you do, huh?

1142
01:53:00,791 --> 01:53:02,875
What did you do?

1143
01:53:18,250 --> 01:53:22,458
- I fucked up.
- What did you do, Juan?

1144
01:53:22,708 --> 01:53:26,250
What have you done, honey?
What have you done?

1145
01:53:27,208 --> 01:53:31,458
The officer said you're a suspect
in the museum robbery.

1146
01:53:33,708 --> 01:53:37,416
I told him he was wrong.

1147
01:53:39,541 --> 01:53:42,666
That you gave us
a hard time...

1148
01:53:42,958 --> 01:53:45,458
...that we struggled with you...

1149
01:53:45,875 --> 01:53:48,416
...but that you were
no thief.

1150
01:53:51,333 --> 01:53:53,000
You lied, Dad.

1151
01:53:55,416 --> 01:53:57,041
I am.

1152
01:53:58,916 --> 01:54:00,500
It was me.

1153
01:54:02,375 --> 01:54:03,625
I did it.

1154
01:54:04,250 --> 01:54:06,000
Stupid son of a bitch.

1155
01:54:07,458 --> 01:54:09,541
Stupid son of a bitch!

1156
01:54:09,875 --> 01:54:11,708
Dumb son of a bitch!

1157
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:16,208
You dumb moron!
Son of a bitch!

1158
01:54:17,416 --> 01:54:19,375
Why did you do it?

1159
01:54:23,958 --> 01:54:27,083
Why... did you do it?

1160
01:54:27,541 --> 01:54:29,791
I'm just no good.

1161
01:54:31,541 --> 01:54:33,416
It's not your fault.

1162
01:54:34,875 --> 01:54:36,750
I'm leaving.

1163
01:54:37,125 --> 01:54:41,291
- You won't have to see me again.
- Where will you go?

1164
01:54:41,875 --> 01:54:44,833
They're looking for you
everywhere.

1165
01:54:45,083 --> 01:54:47,000
I don't know.

1166
01:54:49,875 --> 01:54:51,958
I'll disappear.

1167
01:54:53,958 --> 01:54:56,541
I'll never bother you
again.

1168
01:54:58,750 --> 01:55:00,625
What was it you wanted?

1169
01:55:03,333 --> 01:55:04,750
Was it money?

1170
01:55:07,833 --> 01:55:09,666
You have money.

1171
01:55:09,958 --> 01:55:11,416
Always.

1172
01:55:12,375 --> 01:55:15,375
You have never ever
wanted for anything.

1173
01:55:15,875 --> 01:55:18,416
You've always had
everything.

1174
01:55:20,583 --> 01:55:22,583
Why did you do it?

1175
01:55:24,833 --> 01:55:26,375
Why?

1176
01:55:29,375 --> 01:55:31,708
Did you want to impress us?

1177
01:55:34,708 --> 01:55:37,125
We're impressed, Juan.

1178
01:55:38,666 --> 01:55:41,375
We're truly impressed.

1179
01:55:58,833 --> 01:56:00,666
Juan, no...

1180
01:56:21,875 --> 01:56:23,125
Juan.

1181
01:56:37,375 --> 01:56:39,125
We won't take long.

1182
01:56:48,916 --> 01:56:50,250
Dad!

1183
01:57:29,333 --> 01:57:30,958
What is it?

1184
01:57:35,166 --> 01:57:37,250
- What are you doing, Juan?
- Leave the two bags.

1185
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:39,875
Wait for me outside.
I'll be right back.

1186
01:57:40,166 --> 01:57:41,541
Juan!

1187
01:57:53,666 --> 01:57:56,500
What you're seeing here...

1188
01:57:56,750 --> 01:58:00,708
...is the empty display cases
of the relics of the Maya room.

1189
01:58:01,958 --> 01:58:06,041
Authorities claim that a group
of professional traffickers...

1190
01:58:06,291 --> 01:58:09,958
...of about twenty men
pulled off the heist.

1191
01:58:11,208 --> 01:58:14,583
They are experts
in robbing art galleries...

1192
01:58:14,833 --> 01:58:18,375
...of the highest caliber,
and connections in Africa...

1193
01:58:18,666 --> 01:58:19,916
...Asia and Europe.

1194
01:58:20,208 --> 01:58:22,541
When the museum reopened
after the robbery...

1195
01:58:22,791 --> 01:58:25,125
...more people came
than ever before.

1196
01:58:28,250 --> 01:58:31,625
Everyone wanted to see
the empty cases.

1197
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:42,000
That fat intellectual guy,
the one with the cats...

1198
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:45,791
...said that was the robbers'
gift to Mexico:

1199
01:58:46,208 --> 01:58:50,166
The reminder that no one knows
what they have until it's gone.

1200
01:59:17,375 --> 01:59:19,041
No touching.

1201
01:59:24,500 --> 01:59:28,291
Pakal was one of the most
important rulers of Palenque.

1202
01:59:28,708 --> 01:59:31,333
THIS PIECE IS A REPLICA
OF THE ORIGINAL

1203
01:59:31,875 --> 01:59:37,750
Hieroglyphic records tell us he rose
to the throne when he was twelve.

1204
01:59:38,166 --> 01:59:42,500
And he died well into
his eighties.

1205
01:59:43,291 --> 01:59:47,000
The mask and the whole
funeral attire are important...

1206
01:59:47,291 --> 01:59:53,625
...because they weren't plundered,
the tomb wasn't opened until 1952.

1207
01:59:53,875 --> 01:59:55,916
I said no touching!

1208
01:59:56,458 --> 02:00:00,416
So, the funeral attire was found
exactly like the Mayas placed it...

1209
02:00:00,708 --> 02:00:03,375
...when Pakal's body
was laid to rest.

1210
02:00:06,541 --> 02:00:08,125
Attention. R-3.

1211
02:00:08,375 --> 02:00:10,583
Attention.
Maya room. R-3.

1212
02:00:10,833 --> 02:00:13,000
Suspect headed to the
central courtyard.

1213
02:00:45,333 --> 02:00:47,208
Sometimes I wonder...

1214
02:00:47,750 --> 02:00:52,250
...what would've happened
if Juan hadn't separated from me.

1215
02:00:54,750 --> 02:00:58,041
Sometimes I wonder
why he did it.

1216
02:00:59,958 --> 02:01:02,750
Why we did
everything we did.

1217
02:01:04,916 --> 02:01:08,333
But then I remember
what Juan used to say...

1218
02:01:09,583 --> 02:01:14,500
...about how only the person who did
something knows why they did it.

1219
02:01:16,333 --> 02:01:19,083
And more often that not,
not even them.

1220
02:01:19,541 --> 02:01:20,750
Freeze!

1221
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,916
And if they do know...

1222
02:01:23,250 --> 02:01:25,500
...they won't tell you anyway.

1223
02:01:31,875 --> 02:01:36,000
Juan said if I ever told our story,
I shouldn't tell the truth.

1224
02:01:36,875 --> 02:01:38,750
I asked him why.

1225
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,625
"The truth?" he said.

1226
02:01:42,875 --> 02:01:46,250
"Why ruin a good story
with the truth?"

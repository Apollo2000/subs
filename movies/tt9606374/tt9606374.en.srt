2
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,534
And remember,
don't give your heart to any boys.

3
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,619
You're mine.

4
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,120
Until you get married.

5
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,665
Then you're still mine.

6
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,251
Um, okay, Dad.

7
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,618
Where are we going?

8
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,081
It's gonna be fun. Come on.

9
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,175
Nobody tells you
that once you get married,

10
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,927
you will never fuck again.

11
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,138
If you like fucking,
marriage ain't for you.

12
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,725
Shit, I haven't fucked in seven years.

13
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:25,479
I've had intercourse.

14
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,498
Hi.

15
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,627
Hi.

16
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,338
Oh.

17
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,425
Hi.

18
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,608
- Mom, can I have some juice?
- Yes.

19
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,485
- How was London?
- London was great.

20
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,404
- Yeah?
- English guys are in for 20%.

21
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:16,446
- Really?
- Yeah.

22
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,698
- Well done.
- Thank you.

23
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:21,660
We have to put a deposit down
on that house for July. That week in July.

24
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,620
And I have to figure that out by tomorrow.

25
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:27,124
Baby, I don't know what's happening then,
okay? Listen. But I'll check, okay?

26
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,709
- Come here. Kisses. Come on.
- We're so late.

27
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,670
Oh, and, um, Jimmy's new restaurant.
Thursday or Friday?

28
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,714
I just have to let him know
'cause they're really busy.

29
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:34,631
Okay. Thursday.

30
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,341
- Put your shoes on, please. Please.
- Bye.

31
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,759
- I love you. Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

32
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,678
- Come on, Theo.
- Hey.

33
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,847
- Any more questions?
- Aw, cute.

34
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,224
- Please put your shoes on.
- I want the princess shoes.

35
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:47,227
You gotta put your real shoes on.
We're so late, okay?

36
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:48,437
- Okay.
- Okay.

37
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,857
Okay. Sorry. Gotta go. Gotta go.

38
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,026
Okay.

39
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,739
- Did you finish your reading?
- Yeah.

40
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,158
- Yeah?
- I finished my reading too.

41
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,618
What? You did?

42
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,163
- Mom, we're really late.
- Okay. Okay.

43
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,540
- Hey, let's get coffee this weekend.
- Oh, yeah. For sure.

44
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:11,543
Okay, okay.
Help Mommy, okay? Take your toy.

45
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:12,878
Okay.

46
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,047
I'll come fix it for you.

47
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,214
Wait up for me!

48
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,384
- Okay, have a good day.
- Bye.

49
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:20,594
- Love you.
- Goodbye.

50
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,720
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye.

51
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,180
- Okay. Okay.
- Hi.

52
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,973
- Hi.
- I know. I look awful.

53
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,308
- No.
- I just had a peel.

54
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,310
My face will be red and flaky for a week.

55
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,604
But then it'll be so smooth,
you won't believe it.

56
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,231
Okay. Okay. Let's go.

57
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,942
Laura. Oh, what a stroke of luck.
Hi, little boo-boo.

58
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,778
We need to have coffee.
I'm sure you don't have time.

59
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,656
But we need to have coffee.
I'm seeing that guy again.

60
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,324
- Oh, are you?
- Yeah, it's happening.

61
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,493
And I actually think it's fine.

62
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,079
- Yeah.
- But for me, I cannot stop texting him.

63
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,830
- Right.
- But then I text him, and I'm like,

64
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,500
"I know that every time I text you,
I'm pushing you farther away."

65
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,169
But then I do that, and I keep doing it.
I cannot stop myself.

66
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,254
Right.

67
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:59,174
And then I'm like, "Okay, you know what?
Be tender. Be tender with yourself."

68
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:01,718
Because this is
a matter of the heart, you know?

69
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,847
It's like, mm,
we had an affair during Hurricane Sandy.

70
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,099
Like, the entire thing is something

71
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:10,477
that I'm trying to look at
with introspection and empathy. And...

72
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:12,563
- I'm so sorry, but we actually have to go.
- Oh, no.

73
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,023
- But I'll see you soon.
- I'm so sorry. I'll text you. Yeah.

74
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,316
Okay. Bye.

75
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,780
- Laura.
- Hi.

76
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:22,906
Hi. I'm so late.

77
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,950
- Okay. Talk to you later. Bye.
- Have a good one. Bye.

78
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,034
Get in.

79
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,372
Can you please
put on your seat belt for me?

80
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,040
Oh.

81
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,168
Read me another story.

82
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:35,836
Go to sleep.

83
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,384
- Can I ask you a weird question?
- Sure.

84
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,303
Well, last night Dean got back.

85
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:47,347
He was really out of it.
He takes Xanax on the plane.

86
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:53,604
And he started kissing me,
and then he heard my voice.

87
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:57,816
And it was like I woke him up.
He was surprised and stopped.

88
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,069
It was almost like
he thought I was someone else.

89
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,154
What?

90
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,325
Oh, that's weird.
But he was just out of it.

91
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,701
Yeah, I guess.

92
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,621
He's such a good guy. And he adores you.

93
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:14,374
You know, he's traveling
with clients all the time, and...

94
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:18,629
I'm just the buzzkill
waiting to schedule things. I...

95
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,756
I can't even write.

96
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,926
I should've never
sold a book before writing it.

97
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,346
Oh, that's okay.
Give yourself a break. You have a toddler.

98
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,433
And you'll get back to work
when you're ready.

99
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,876
- All right, hang on.
- Yeah.

100
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,004
I can hear you now.

101
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,506
What do you think...
from a man's point of view?

102
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,301
Am I crazy?

103
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,095
No. He thought you were someone else.

104
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,722
What? You think so?

105
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:52,806
Absolutely.

106
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,811
You're just dark and don't know anything
about a committed relationship.

107
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:58,979
Oh, really?

108
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,063
Yes, really.

109
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,524
You need to start thinking like a man.

110
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:03,650
Felix!

111
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,485
Thanks, Dad. That's really helpful.

112
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,821
Is that a birthmark?

113
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:11,074
You know, I don't know why
I asked you of all people. Never mind.

114
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,493
If you need me, I'm here.

115
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:14,578
Hang on, shorty.

116
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,793
You there, shorty?

117
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:25,380
Enjoy Paris. Have a French 76 for me.

118
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:30,427
I can try. Call if you need anything.
I'll be back soon. I love you.

119
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:31,512
Bye.

120
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,852
Mommy! Mommy!

121
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,148
Time for the llama's haircut?

122
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,692
No. I have to wash her first.

123
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:48,779
It's okay.

124
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,160
First, I'm gonna give you a bath.

125
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,340
We're gonna clean you up.

126
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,140
I'm gonna brush your hair.

127
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:25,941
I'm brushing your hair, little llama.

128
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,485
Brush, brush, brush, brush, brush.

129
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,988
Will I see you and the girls this weekend?

130
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,156
- Your mother and sister are coming.
- Oh, Theo.

131
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,286
Um, you know what, Gran?
Can I... Can I just call you back?

132
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,413
I'm... I'm taking Theo to a class.

133
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,497
See you then.

134
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:43,375
Three, four, five, six.

135
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,378
Got it. Good job.

136
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:09,484
Head back. Head back.

137
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:13,906
Face me. Face me. Face this way.
Here. Ooh.

138
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:17,784
I love you.

139
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,067
- There you guys are. Hi. Cheers.
- Hi.

140
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,151
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

141
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:53,445
Hard at work, I see. Cheers, cheers.

142
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:57,074
Love what you're wearing.
You're looking so hot.

143
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,909
How's the food? Is it good? Is it good?

144
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,202
- Hi.
- Hey.

145
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,286
You look good.

146
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,038
Thanks.

147
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:05,290
Here. Meet the team.

148
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:06,375
Team.

149
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,754
- Oh, my God. Hi. You must be Laura.
- Baby, this is the team.

150
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:11,880
Hey. Yeah.

151
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:14,967
- Fiona. So good to finally meet you.
- I'll be right back.

152
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,136
I'm sorry. Dean must've told you, there's
just so much going on here right now.

153
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,556
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's crazy with the, um...

154
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,517
With the new offices opening
and everything, and... Oh!

155
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:29,356
I heard that the guys from A24 were here.
I have to go speak with them.

156
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,985
We just started working with the Ghosts.
Have you seen them?

157
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,487
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah. They're actually really good.

158
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,826
Well, can I get you something?

159
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,369
- Uh, I think I'm fine for now.
- Great.

160
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,497
Jenna, Chase, this is Laura, Dean's wife.

161
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:47,040
- Hi.
- Be right back.

162
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,250
- Hi.
- Hi.

163
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,460
So... you work here?

164
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,590
Uh-huh. Yeah.
I started a few months ago, so...

165
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,176
Oh, cool. Are you liking it so far?

166
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,678
Yeah. Yeah.

167
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,474
- Dean's really great to work with.
- Oh.

168
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:06,810
Great.

169
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:16,361
Congrats! Guys! 500K!

170
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:18,989
- Well done, team!
- Congrats.

171
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,492
Five hundred K. It's all you. How sweet.

172
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:24,286
All of us.

173
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,413
- Thank you, guys. Thank you.
- Thank you.

174
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,372
Yeah.

175
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:29,041
- Well done.
- Thank you.

176
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:31,919
- We made it this...
- Really did.

177
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,045
Oh, I know.

178
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:34,630
Great party.

179
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:36,632
Told you
the party would go smoothly.

180
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,550
- Why didn't you trust me?
- Okay.

181
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:39,843
- All right!
- Bye!

182
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,388
Babe, what a night.

183
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,725
Five hundred thousand new followers.
We're killing it.

184
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:50,187
The amount of engagement, the insight.
I mean, this is crazy.

185
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,522
I mean...

186
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:55,943
between our briefs, our team, the amount
of, like, the ROIs, return on investments,

187
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,444
we're crushing it.

188
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:58,946
- So great.
- Yeah.

189
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,283
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

190
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:11,917
I found, um, a woman's toiletry case
when I was unpacking your bag.

191
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,963
Oh. That's Fiona's.

192
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:21,093
She couldn't fit it in her carry-on,
so I put it in my luggage.

193
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,761
I must've forgot about it, so...

194
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:26,139
- Right.
- Yeah.

195
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:29,142
I'll just bring it to her
tomorrow at the office. Thank you.

196
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:48,912
Let me have it. Let me have it.

197
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,581
Okay, okay. Ready.

198
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,791
Did anyone see my brush?

199
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,376
We're going to see Grandma.

200
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,586
And Mommy's grandma.

201
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,171
- Bye, babies.
- Bye.

202
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,338
- Bye.
- Say bye.

203
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:00,799
- Bye. Love you.
- Love you.

204
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:03,552
- Have fun with your family.
- Yeah, right. Thanks.

205
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,054
- Okay. Try to have fun with your family.
- Okay.

206
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:08,140
Love you. If you need me,
I'll be at the office.

207
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,224
- Okay.
- All right?

208
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:10,934
Say bye.

209
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,477
- Bye, girls.
- Bye.

210
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:14,271
- I love you.
- Bye. Love you.

211
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,355
Love you.

212
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:16,440
- Bye.
- You too.

213
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,649
Bye.

214
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:21,320
- Hey, Gran. How are you?
- So glad you're here.

215
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:26,491
I laid out on the terrace last night
looking at the stars. It was glorious.

216
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:28,952
Oh, that's so nice.

217
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:32,164
How's the apartment?
Did you finish the bedroom?

218
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:35,334
They just finished, and it is so cheerful.

219
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:40,214
I could be in there with five blizzards
and not get depressed.

220
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:41,673
Oh, that's so nice.

221
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:45,093
I just got a luscious cream rug
from Cogolin.

222
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,055
You know, Laura...

223
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:53,018
if you're going to dress that way,
you could make more of an effort.

224
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,103
Please, Gran, I think she looks terrific.

225
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:57,731
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

226
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,692
I talked to Dad the other day.
He's in Paris.

227
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:02,528
Oh. How is Felix?

228
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:05,364
You know, his usual chipper self.

229
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:06,615
I wonder what he's up to.

230
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,910
- Well, he does keep himself amused.
- Mm-hmm.

231
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,705
Oh, he was always a handful,
since he was a little boy.

232
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:16,792
He could never stay put for very long.

233
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,794
Never really knew what he was thinking.

234
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,004
I don't know how you can deal with him.

235
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:24,842
Your father owes me a visit.

236
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,764
Is Dean still traveling a lot
with that new assistant?

237
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,809
Um... account manager.

238
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:35,727
Yeah. She's, um...

239
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,896
- Yeah, she seems nice.
- Mm.

240
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,439
She very attractive?

241
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,526
I don't know.
I mean... Yeah, she's attractive.

242
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,322
New York is filled
with attractive women though.

243
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,449
Well, okay.

244
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:51,785
French fry?

245
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,328
No. Thank you.

246
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:54,997
They're so good.

247
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,209
Come on.

248
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:04,965
- Come on, Maya! Come on!
- You better not use my markers.

249
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,426
- Mom says you have to share.
- Mom!

250
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,895
Mom, she's pulling my hair!

251
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,731
Don't do that! Stop!

252
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:05,358
She's hurting me, Mom, Dad!

253
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,444
Mommy!

254
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,530
- Mommy!
- To be continued.

255
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,200
Where's my toothbrush?

256
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,743
Mom, did you remember
to check my homework?

257
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,748
- Yes. It's on the bench in the hallway.
- Can you pick up my little guy?

258
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,626
He's trying to get you.

259
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,710
Brush, please.

260
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,628
- Please brush.
- Okay.

261
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,172
- Go get your book bag.
- Okay.

262
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:28,674
Rinse, rinse, rinse, rinse.

263
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,135
- Thank you.
- Hurry up!

264
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,555
Can I have a cookie? Can I have a cookie?

265
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:37,766
No, you cannot have a cookie.
We just had breakfast.

266
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,769
And it's not just, like, a sexual thing.

267
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:42,813
Because he's coming to me.

268
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,773
I'm the one with the ideas
for our company.

269
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:46,692
- Right.
- You know? And this whole thing started

270
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,653
because I was like, "You know what?
Why are nails not more ornamental?"

271
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,614
Obviously, they're functional. We need
them to hold our furniture together.

272
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:54,700
But, you know, I was like,
"It's about these small details

273
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:57,119
that actually aren't just details.
They can be treasures."

274
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:59,621
And he was like, "That was really...
That's really inspiring."

275
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:03,375
In fact, just having this conversation
is how we ended up being together.

276
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,210
- Okay, see you later.
- Okay, bye, bye, bye.

277
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:10,048
One, two, three,

278
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:14,011
four, five, six, eight.

279
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:42,789
Hey, kiddo.

280
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,460
Feel like hopping in?

281
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:47,794
Feel like scooting over?

282
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,966
Hi, Dad.

283
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:56,470
You can still break my ribs.

284
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:59,556
- Hi, Musto.
- Hi, Laura. Nice to see you.

285
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,769
Mus, you know that this one
is named after the song...

286
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:13,862
You know this one, Musto?

287
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:25,999
- It's one of my favorites.
- Lead part, please.

288
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:32,214
- I can't whistle.
- Oh, come on.

289
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:33,882
No, seriously.

290
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:41,139
No, I can't anymore.
It's so weird. Ever since I had kids.

291
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:43,684
No kid of mine is gonna stop whistling.

292
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,478
We're working on this. Come on.

293
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,399
Nice bracelet.

294
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:51,483
Thank you.

295
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:56,822
The bangle is a reminder
that women were once men's property.

296
00:19:57,322 --> 00:20:00,033
I'm sure that's exactly
what Dean was going for.

297
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:06,164
Do you think I'm underdressed?

298
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:08,041
You just show 'em your cute mug.

299
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:16,425
- Oh, my gosh, do you look beautiful.
- Ugh.

300
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:19,678
You're about to see Cliff.

301
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:23,432
- Hello, Mr. Keane.
- Cliff. How's your mom's hip?

302
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:24,975
- Good, thanks.
- Good.

303
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:28,729
You tell her to do her exercises or she
may as well have kept the old one, huh?

304
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:31,231
Good afternoon, Mr. Keane.

305
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:33,442
- He thinks you're my girlfriend.
- Uh-huh.

306
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,908
Hey, I'll have a Cutty on the rocks
and a Bombay martini for the kid.

307
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:43,410
Oh. Okay.

308
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:47,956
You know what's interesting?

309
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,585
Back when humans walked on all fours,

310
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:57,174
it was the sight of the female haunches
that excited them.

311
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:01,261
So that when
we finally stood up on two legs,

312
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:05,682
it was the women with the rounded breasts
that mirrored the haunches

313
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,935
that were most exciting to the males.

314
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,395
So, they made babies with them,

315
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:14,399
and eventually, that shape
evolved into what is our modern female.

316
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:15,859
Ah. Wow.

317
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:19,780
And men were attracted
to adolescent females

318
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:23,867
because they were easier to catch,
therefore ultimately easier to mate.

319
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,746
And slowly over time, these qualities...

320
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:29,831
small size...

321
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,709
smooth skin...

322
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:34,920
high voice...

323
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:37,089
little or no beard...

324
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,134
evolved into the qualities
most desired today.

325
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:44,847
So they prefer no beard? Good to know.

326
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,306
Like you.

327
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,560
Thank you.

328
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,981
Ballet dancer.

329
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:58,110
Yes. I studied at the Bolshoi.

330
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,741
Dad, can we order? 'Cause I gotta get back
and pick up the kids.

331
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:05,826
Sure.

332
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:08,871
I'll have the rib eye,
well done, with spinach.

333
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:11,582
I'll have the chopped salad, please.
Thank you.

334
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:17,880
Can you ever just act normal
around any woman?

335
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:21,133
She's a ballet dancer.
They love to be complimented.

336
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:26,597
So, do you miss having the gallery?

337
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,725
No.
I still have the odd deal here and there.

338
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:32,686
Did I tell you I got a new assistant?
Few days.

339
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:33,979
Oh. That's good.

340
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:37,900
You know what's great about her?

341
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:42,446
She doesn't talk. She just listens.

342
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:46,033
That sounds perfect for you.

343
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:49,703
So Dean's going away a lot, huh?
On business trips?

344
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:52,789
Dad, not everyone is like you.

345
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:56,293
Where was he coming back from
when he was acting so strange?

346
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,128
- London.
- London.

347
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:00,589
Where was he staying?

348
00:23:01,173 --> 00:23:03,634
I think it was Blakes?

349
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:07,095
- Blakes?
- Blakes. Yeah. Why?

350
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:09,473
Blakes is a

351
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:15,229
cozy, little off-the-beaten-track hotel

352
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:18,732
that I wouldn't stay at
if I were on a business trip.

353
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:20,567
Huh.

354
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:30,744
I know a concierge over at Claridge's.
He knows all the concierges.

355
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,704
When was he there?

356
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:36,959
Last week,
but let's not get carried away, okay?

357
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:43,799
There was something.

358
00:23:45,092 --> 00:23:46,093
What?

359
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:50,264
Never mind.

360
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:53,809
What?

361
00:23:58,021 --> 00:23:59,147
There were some...

362
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:03,819
There were some of his
coworker's toiletries in his luggage.

363
00:24:04,403 --> 00:24:05,696
Sloppy move.

364
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:10,117
But she couldn't put them
in her carry-on through security,

365
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,245
so he offered to put them in his luggage.
That's it.

366
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:16,290
Raise your hand if that sounds fishy.

367
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:19,251
You know what?
I shouldn't have said anything. Forget it.

368
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:21,545
- Have you checked his phone?
- No.

369
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:24,506
Well, do yourself a favor,
check his text messages.

370
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:29,511
If it's... I mean, it may come to nothing,
but, you know, may as well make sure.

371
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:31,889
Dean is not like you.

372
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:34,600
Okay, he's a nerd.
He's a good guy. A great dad.

373
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:36,810
He's a man. It's nature.

374
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:43,734
Males are forced to fight to dominate
and to impregnate all females.

375
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:52,326
Sorry.

376
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:56,246
I remember the first time
I saw your mother.

377
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:00,292
It was a beach party.
Back then, all the girls wore bikinis.

378
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:06,465
Your mother walked out of the ocean
in a white one-piece swimming suit,

379
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:09,009
and that was it for me. I was done.

380
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:11,553
Staying on track...

381
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,140
what does Dean have planned
for your birthday?

382
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,893
He's not gonna be here for my birthday.

383
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:21,146
What kind of guy
forgets his wife's birthday?

384
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,523
He didn't forget.

385
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:25,150
He has a work trip, but we're gonna
celebrate when he gets back.

386
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:26,401
That's not the same.

387
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:31,532
I traveled. I never missed a birthday.

388
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:34,910
Right.
But you had some other shortcomings.

389
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:39,081
Like what?

390
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:44,962
Thank you.

391
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:53,554
All right, I'm gonna take you to 21.

392
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:56,348
Just do me a favor.
Check his texts, will you?

393
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:59,852
And if there's anything else
you can think about London...

394
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:05,232
At some point, we can make a decision
about whether to tap his phone.

395
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:07,359
- No.
- Laura, come on.

396
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:09,862
He should be worshipping
the ground you walk on,

397
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:12,489
and if he's not, you need to know.

398
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:16,201
Now, it's probably nothing, but...

399
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,002
check his phone.

400
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:28,714
Do I swim?

401
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:29,882
Yes.

402
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:31,758
Am I green?

403
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:33,051
- Yes.
- Yes.

404
00:26:33,135 --> 00:26:36,305
Do I make this noise? Gribbit.

405
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:38,265
- Yes.
- Mm...

406
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:42,269
No? Yes?

407
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:43,854
Hey, did you change your password?

408
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:45,314
You're sometimes green.

409
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:48,483
I was, um, trying to send
that cute picture of the girls to my mom.

410
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:49,568
Oh.

411
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:53,780
Yeah, there's a... a new
security protocol at work.

412
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:57,159
They just change it up
for some reason, so... Here.

413
00:26:58,327 --> 00:27:00,370
You sure you don't wanna use your phone?

414
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:02,122
No, I don't have that picture.

415
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:03,874
- Oh, okay.
- Thanks.

416
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:06,793
- You good?
- Yeah.

417
00:27:06,877 --> 00:27:07,711
Okay.

418
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:09,129
All right, girls. Daddy gotta get to work.

419
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:10,797
- Bye.
- Gimme a kiss.

420
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:13,884
Hey, be nice. And be nice to Mommy.

421
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,093
- Bye, Daddy.
- I love you.

422
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:17,095
- Love you.
- Love you.

423
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:19,640
Um, sorry I'm not gonna be here
for your birthday.

424
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:21,642
- I'll make it up soon as I get back, okay?
- Yeah.

425
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:22,726
- All right.
- Okay.

426
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:24,561
- Bye.
- Bye.

427
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:26,855
I need to have some for breakfast.

428
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:31,944
No! Definitely no.

429
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,380
Grandpa!

430
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:54,383
You can still fly.

431
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:56,176
Where can I toss you folks out?

432
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,095
Ready?

433
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:00,806
- My God.
- We're going to ballet. 51 Walker Street.

434
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:03,183
I'd love to.
You been working on your whistling?

435
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:04,518
Not really.

436
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:05,602
Shove over, tiny.

437
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:08,522
- Hi, Musto.
- Hi, guys. Nice to see you again.

438
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:09,898
You too.

439
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:11,441
Honey, put your seat belt on.

440
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:14,361
- Let's take it from the top.
- Okay.

441
00:28:16,572 --> 00:28:18,365
Emerald City.
As quick as lightning.

442
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:19,449
Just, like, air.

443
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:22,911
It helps to have a little bit more belly.
Try to get it from the belly.

444
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:27,583
It's useless.

445
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:29,334
I'm sorry, hey.

446
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:31,587
Sorry. Wanna go say hi?

447
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,173
You did a really great job today.
Great job.

448
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:36,383
- Hey.
- Hi.

449
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:37,968
Hi.

450
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:39,052
Hi.

451
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:41,555
Maya, my precious.

452
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:45,809
It's been too long.
I can't live without you.

453
00:28:46,143 --> 00:28:48,187
Are you gonna come take my class? Hey.

454
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:49,938
You're in fourth position.

455
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:52,608
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

456
00:28:52,691 --> 00:28:54,026
Dad, this is Miss Mindy.

457
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:56,111
Hello, Miss Mindy.

458
00:28:56,862 --> 00:28:58,697
- Goodbye, Miss Mindy. Thank you.
- Okay.

459
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,073
- See you next week.
- Bye, Miss Mindy.

460
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:01,867
- Say bye, Maya. Okay.
- Bye.

461
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:08,749
Right this way, ladies. Ladies and ladies.

462
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:12,753
- Musto, pull over a second.
- You got it.

463
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:15,839
I want a unicorn balloon.
Yeah, yeah, the unicorn.

464
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,976
I'm gonna jump in the shower quick.
Can you just watch them?

465
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:28,894
- Sure.
- Come on.

466
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:48,413
- Does my foot smell funny? Ew.
- Ew!

467
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:51,375
- 'Cause I was wondering...
- We're watching Breaking Bad.

468
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:53,168
- What?
- It's really good.

469
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:54,962
It's a great show. Have you seen it?

470
00:29:55,045 --> 00:29:58,048
Yes, I have seen it.
It's great. It's not for kids.

471
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:00,008
What? Was there something bad on?

472
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:01,552
No.

473
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:03,512
- Yeah.
- Hey, look, I can shuffle.

474
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:06,098
Oh, wow. That's great.

475
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:10,811
We learned that all young girls
should know how to shuffle. And how to...

476
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,104
Bluff.

477
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:14,189
Bluff. Right.

478
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:15,357
And how do you bluff?

479
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,234
- Poker face.
- Poker face.

480
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:19,027
Poker face.

481
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:20,904
Poker face.

482
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:24,157
Nice, nice.

483
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:27,035
And that girls should wear their hair
long and pretty, how boys like it.

484
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:31,123
Or you can wear it short,
or however you wanna wear it.

485
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:33,208
- Long and pretty.
- Long and pretty.

486
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,335
Don't listen to him, okay?

487
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:38,630
You're gonna grow up,
and you're gonna be strong women

488
00:30:38,714 --> 00:30:41,049
who get to wear their hair
however they like.

489
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,886
Now it's dinnertime.
What were you drinking?

490
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:45,304
We made egg creams.

491
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:49,141
You were all out of Fox's U-bet.
But we made do.

492
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:51,560
This is not good before dinner.

493
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:53,979
Well, nobody wants one after dinner.

494
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:55,063
Yeah.

495
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:58,192
Time to wash our hands.
Let's go. Dinnertime.

496
00:30:58,275 --> 00:31:00,152
Let's get going. Jump over. Jump.

497
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:02,321
Wash your feet too.

498
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:06,116
You two guys drop food on the floor
too much.

499
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,534
And it's wasteful.

500
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:09,995
Clean toes, pop that back into your mouth.

501
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:12,581
Ten-second rule. Learn to respect it.

502
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:14,917
Can we have burgers?

503
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,251
All right, I'm off.

504
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:18,045
We're gonna talk
about your birthday tomorrow?

505
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:19,796
Oh, yeah.

506
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,258
Um, actually, I don't really feel like
celebrating my birthday this year.

507
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:27,846
The celebration of the date of one's birth
was originally a pagan tradition.

508
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:31,934
Historically, Christians didn't celebrate
for that very reason.

509
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:33,727
Now, we're past that, aren't we?

510
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:39,650
Kids. Do you want a mom who doesn't want
to get taken out for cake and ice cream?

511
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:40,984
- Ice cream. Ice cream!
- Ice cream!

512
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:43,362
- I just don't feel like it, okay?
- Please?

513
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:44,988
We'll talk tomorrow, okay?

514
00:31:45,072 --> 00:31:46,823
- I love you all.
- Love you.

515
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:50,452
The biggest one the most
and then in descending order.

516
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:52,454
Keep up the good work.

517
00:31:52,955 --> 00:31:54,248
Bye, Grandpa!

518
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:55,541
Bye, Grandpa.

519
00:31:58,585 --> 00:32:01,380
Hey, Felix. You're back in town.

520
00:32:01,463 --> 00:32:03,131
- I am.
- Yes, you are.

521
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:05,092
Been busy?

522
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:07,594
Yeah. Got a lot going on.

523
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:09,346
Do you?

524
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:11,056
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

525
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:13,350
- Well.
- You good?

526
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:15,352
- Yeah, I'm good.
- All right.

527
00:32:16,812 --> 00:32:18,605
- You?
- I'm great.

528
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:23,068
- Good night.
- Good night.

529
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:30,868
Where to?

530
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,705
Let's go home.

531
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:28,091
Here you go. Thank you.

532
00:33:29,885 --> 00:33:32,679
So, do you want anything
back from Los Angeles?

533
00:33:32,763 --> 00:33:34,598
Um, where do I start?

534
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:36,350
Ooh. Sounds expensive.

535
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:37,726
- Love you.
- Love you.

536
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:39,144
Hey, cheer up.

537
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:41,939
- Bye.
- Bye, Dad.

538
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,483
Have fun.

539
00:33:44,942 --> 00:33:46,902
- Bye.
- Can't have fun without you guys.

540
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:49,738
- That's my reality right now.
- Mm-hmm.

541
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:54,451
And actually, now that I think about it,
perhaps she did show me some strength,

542
00:33:54,535 --> 00:33:57,037
because here I am,
standing in my own power.

543
00:33:57,663 --> 00:34:00,582
Those flowers are pretty. Wow.

544
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:04,628
Wow. So pretty. Look at these flowers.

545
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:07,297
- You can pull them out if you want to.
- They're so nice.

546
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:10,300
- Yeah, if you wanna pull them out...
- Do you think they're from Daddy?

547
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:11,552
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

548
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:13,971
Oh, they're from my daddy.

549
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:20,726
"Behind the speaker's platform
hung an oil painting, richly framed,

550
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:26,525
depicting the mouse in Aesop's fable in
its heroic act of freeing a captive lion.

551
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:29,194
Well, it's like this"...

552
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:31,196
Oh. Look, it's Daddy.

553
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:42,040
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi. Hi, birthday girl.

554
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:43,125
Hi, babies.

555
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,042
- Hi.
- Hi.

556
00:34:44,126 --> 00:34:45,543
Greetings from Hollywood.

557
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:47,212
How's your birthday?

558
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:50,174
Good. It's pretty mellow.
It's really nice.

559
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:51,675
Nice. Good.

560
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:55,179
Babies, uh, go get the gift
that we wrapped for Mommy.

561
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:57,054
I'm gonna get it.

562
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:59,933
- Miss you guys so much.
- Miss you too.

563
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:02,352
That's sneaky.

564
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:04,396
- You guys planned this?
- Just a little.

565
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,856
Do you think she's gonna like it?

566
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:07,900
- You look good.
- Thanks.

567
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:09,484
- How's it going?
- It's right there.

568
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:10,819
Miss that little smile.

569
00:35:13,322 --> 00:35:17,117
Okay, now listen, the gift, I want you
to understand, it's a little different.

570
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:20,078
What is this enormous box?

571
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:21,955
It's nerdy, but it's actually really cool.

572
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:23,498
Is this... Do you wanna come help Mommy?

573
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:25,626
- Here, you take that.
- The girls helped me wrap it.

574
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:28,086
- Okay. Okay. Yeah.
- Got to take the tie off.

575
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:30,380
- Start with the ribbon.
- Gonna help her open it?

576
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:32,466
Baby, back up so I can see Mommy.

577
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:34,092
What is it?

578
00:35:35,928 --> 00:35:37,513
All right, so this is different.

579
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:40,015
Thermomix.

580
00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:42,309
Twelve different appliances
all rolled in one.

581
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:48,023
It does, like, mixing, weighing,
kneading, chopping, everything.

582
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:50,901
But, you know what,
it's perfect for, like, making things.

583
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:53,612
Hey, guys,
you gonna make Mommy a big birthday pizza?

584
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:55,447
- Yes.
- Yes.

585
00:35:55,531 --> 00:35:56,657
Thank you.

586
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,325
There's one more part to your present...

587
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:00,452
...but it's not ready yet. Okay?

588
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:02,788
Um, I... Can I call you back? I'm sorry.

589
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:04,998
You know what, I got meetings.
I'll call you later. I love you.

590
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:06,250
Bye. Love you.

591
00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:09,795
Hello?

592
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:11,088
I'm down here.

593
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:14,675
What? I told you I wasn't coming.

594
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:17,052
Buzz me in.

595
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:18,887
Oh, yeah? Mama!

596
00:36:18,971 --> 00:36:20,806
Stop being so annoying.

597
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:24,309
Get back in bed.

598
00:36:28,564 --> 00:36:30,190
Mommy.

599
00:36:30,274 --> 00:36:32,484
- Good night. Love you.
- Good night, Mom. Happy birthday.

600
00:36:32,568 --> 00:36:33,569
Thank you, honey.

601
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,781
What are you...

602
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:43,245
I'm taking you out.
You can't not celebrate your birthday.

603
00:36:43,328 --> 00:36:44,997
I don't have a babysitter.

604
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:48,959
Musto. He's got four kids.
They're all still alive.

605
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:51,628
Yeah, I'm sure he's great and everything,

606
00:36:51,712 --> 00:36:55,799
but you can't just show up here
and expect me to...

607
00:36:57,676 --> 00:36:59,469
I'm not taking

608
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:03,098
"you just can't show up here
and expect me to"

609
00:37:03,182 --> 00:37:04,308
for an answer.

610
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:07,519
Get dressed.

611
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:13,150
Okay, I'll... I'll call Lucy,
the girl from downstairs,

612
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:17,487
and I'll see if she's available,
but it's really, really short notice.

613
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:19,740
So don't get excited.

614
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,369
- Lucy, hi.
- Hi, Lucy!

615
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:28,415
Hi. Shh. That's my dad. My dad's here.

616
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:30,292
- Mm.
- Yeah, um...

617
00:37:31,335 --> 00:37:35,547
Are you free by any chance to come over?
I just have this last-minute thing.

618
00:37:35,631 --> 00:37:39,718
I won't be too late.
Yeah. Oh, that'd be great.

619
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:43,639
- Thank you so much. Okay.
- Mm.

620
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:53,440
Thank you.

621
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:57,277
Hi, Musto.

622
00:37:57,361 --> 00:37:58,362
Hi, Laura.

623
00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:08,288
You look very lovely.

624
00:38:08,372 --> 00:38:09,456
Thank you.

625
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:12,626
Musto, take us to 21.

626
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:14,753
- 21 it is.
- Thanks.

627
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:22,344
So, did Dean take his trip?

628
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:23,846
Yeah.

629
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:26,431
Did he get you a nice present?

630
00:38:27,266 --> 00:38:28,475
He did, actually.

631
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,561
Jewelry?

632
00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:36,275
No. He got me a nice present.
When are you gonna drop it about Dean?

633
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:39,027
No little red box?

634
00:38:39,111 --> 00:38:41,655
What are you implying?

635
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:49,663
I had him followed. Do you know
where he came from the other night?

636
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:51,957
What? No, where?

637
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,668
52nd and 5th.

638
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,211
So?

639
00:38:57,337 --> 00:38:58,547
It's Cartier.

640
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,760
You didn't get any present from there?

641
00:39:03,844 --> 00:39:04,845
No.

642
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:06,430
At least we know he has taste.

643
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:10,184
Now, what was he doing there?
Did you ever check his phone?

644
00:39:10,267 --> 00:39:13,187
Yes. There weren't any texts.

645
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,439
Well, that's really suspicious.

646
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:19,610
If you're working with someone,
you're in close contact. Unless...

647
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:22,696
he erased 'em.

648
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,698
That bastard.

649
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:27,784
When did this acting strange start?

650
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:32,581
He's just been distracted

651
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:36,543
since he... started this company

652
00:39:36,627 --> 00:39:40,130
and started working with Fiona.

653
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:42,674
Is Fiona Miss Toiletries?

654
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:46,762
The tall business associate, yeah.

655
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:51,850
I mean, how he could do this
to you... I could strangle him.

656
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,646
Here's the Plaza.
This is the place to have an affair.

657
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:57,022
It has the most exits.

658
00:39:57,105 --> 00:39:58,899
Exits on three streets.

659
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:00,984
Can any man be monogamous?

660
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:05,531
Monogamy and marriage
are based on the concept of property.

661
00:40:05,614 --> 00:40:08,283
I've been married for 20 years.

662
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:09,409
See?

663
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:14,248
Women, you can't live with 'em,
you can't live without 'em.

664
00:40:15,082 --> 00:40:17,209
That doesn't mean
you have to live with 'em.

665
00:40:19,628 --> 00:40:22,798
Bogart's table.
Where he proposed to Bacall.

666
00:40:23,257 --> 00:40:24,258
Really?

667
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:27,678
Happy birthday, kiddo.

668
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:29,680
Thank you.

669
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:38,981
Your watch.

670
00:40:39,064 --> 00:40:40,524
Oh, I love this.

671
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:44,278
You used to like to wear that. I think
it might fit you a little better now.

672
00:40:44,653 --> 00:40:46,738
- I've always loved this watch.
- Mm.

673
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:50,993
I bought that for myself
after my first big sale.

674
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:52,327
A de Kooning woman.

675
00:40:52,953 --> 00:40:54,580
I love it. Thank you.

676
00:40:56,206 --> 00:41:00,210
I remember the first moment, the moment,

677
00:41:00,836 --> 00:41:04,256
when I first recognized you as a person.

678
00:41:05,007 --> 00:41:06,300
We were in the country.

679
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:12,014
You were about nine months old,
and you were sitting on the ground,

680
00:41:12,097 --> 00:41:17,311
and I picked you up, and your diaper
was sopping wet with mud and water, and...

681
00:41:17,394 --> 00:41:21,273
we looked at each other
and just started laughing. And...

682
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:25,277
there you were. I saw who you were.

683
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:29,281
And here we are.

684
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:35,704
What next? I think we should follow him.

685
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:37,164
- What?
- Yeah.

686
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:39,875
I think we should keep an eye on him.
See what he's up to.

687
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:41,543
No, I... I can't do that.

688
00:41:41,627 --> 00:41:43,670
I think you better see him in action.

689
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:49,218
Well, they have a work dinner on Friday.

690
00:41:49,301 --> 00:41:51,094
Great.

691
00:41:51,178 --> 00:41:53,805
I'll change car. We'll... We'll tail him.

692
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:57,142
Can you just act
a little less excited about this?

693
00:41:57,226 --> 00:41:59,978
Because this is my life,
and it might be falling apart.

694
00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:04,775
We gotta get you out of this limbo.
We gotta ease your troubled mind.

695
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:07,361
Hey, Greg.

696
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:11,281
Could we bring the little girl
a belly buster, please?

697
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:17,454
I'm not worried about you, kiddo.
You've got brains, beauty and character,

698
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:20,165
which is the most important thing
a person can have.

699
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:24,878
Do you know a woman is at her most
beautiful between the ages of 35 and 39?

700
00:42:25,712 --> 00:42:29,758
Great, so I have many months left.

701
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:33,679
Women are like flowers.
They're all beautiful at any age.

702
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:37,099
Even dried flowers. You know...

703
00:42:37,182 --> 00:42:39,434
I don't know why women
get plastic surgery.

704
00:42:39,518 --> 00:42:41,562
- Because of men like you.
- Mm-mmm.

705
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,814
I prefer the factory original.

706
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:47,693
Yeah, and every other make and model.

707
00:42:49,278 --> 00:42:51,530
Thank you.
I'm gonna take that as a compliment.

708
00:42:51,613 --> 00:42:53,323
Are there two?

709
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:55,617
Scared me.

710
00:42:58,287 --> 00:43:01,915
You know, I think everyone has a right
to their own privacy.

711
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:06,420
But if he's doing something dishonorable,
you need to know

712
00:43:06,503 --> 00:43:09,923
and find out on your own terms,
so you can be prepared for anything.

713
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:12,050
I don't think there's anything at all.
It may not be anything.

714
00:43:12,134 --> 00:43:14,303
We'll find out on Friday.
I'll pick you up, and we'll have some fun.

715
00:43:14,386 --> 00:43:15,387
No.

716
00:43:19,016 --> 00:43:21,393
And that way I'm, like,
I'm gonna take the risk.

717
00:43:21,476 --> 00:43:23,061
I'm gonna introduce him to Milo.

718
00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:25,939
- Yeah.
- It's, like, people to people meeting.

719
00:43:26,023 --> 00:43:28,942
Like, why does it have to be, like,
oh, this guy that I'm sleeping with...

720
00:43:29,026 --> 00:43:30,027
- meets my son.
- Daddy!

721
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,987
- Hey! Come here.
- You know what I mean?

722
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,572
- Mom.
- I'm so sorry.

723
00:43:33,655 --> 00:43:34,698
- Is that crazy?
- I'm so sorry.

724
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:35,782
- Mom!
- Hi!

725
00:43:35,866 --> 00:43:36,867
Hi, Dad!

726
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,160
- How's my big girl?
- Daddy!

727
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:41,330
- Hey, muffin! How's my baby?
- Hey.

728
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:43,582
Hi, baby. How you doing?

729
00:43:43,665 --> 00:43:45,792
- Good.
- How's the birthday girl? How was the day?

730
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:47,044
- Oh, you know.
- Yeah?

731
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:51,006
- My dad. Lots of theories and stories.
- Okay.

732
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:56,553
So, what do you say we go around
the corner and we can celebrate properly?

733
00:43:56,637 --> 00:43:57,763
Yeah, that sounds nice.

734
00:43:57,846 --> 00:43:59,014
- Okay, good.
- I'll call a sitter.

735
00:43:59,097 --> 00:44:00,098
All right.

736
00:44:00,182 --> 00:44:01,475
How was your trip?

737
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:04,520
- How was your trip?
- Oh, the trip?

738
00:44:04,603 --> 00:44:06,104
- Yeah.
- Great. Very productive.

739
00:44:06,188 --> 00:44:08,106
- Yeah?
- Yep. Found an office,

740
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:11,818
had some great meetings.
Oh, we found this really fun karaoke bar.

741
00:44:11,902 --> 00:44:14,446
We had so much fun.

742
00:44:17,783 --> 00:44:18,825
Yeah, it's really cool.

743
00:44:18,909 --> 00:44:20,744
They have these 3D-printed homes

744
00:44:20,827 --> 00:44:23,080
that they can put up for, like,
a few thousand dollars,

745
00:44:23,163 --> 00:44:24,831
and they can do it in, like, a day.

746
00:44:24,915 --> 00:44:27,459
It's really great.
Like, if there's a disaster or something,

747
00:44:27,543 --> 00:44:29,628
you can just rebuild an entire community.

748
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:31,505
Wow. That's really cool.

749
00:44:31,588 --> 00:44:33,590
- Technology, man. It's crazy.
- Yeah.

750
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:37,511
How's the thing?

751
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:38,679
Writing?

752
00:44:42,015 --> 00:44:45,227
Yeah, I don't know.
I'm so used to writing at night.

753
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:50,691
So, sitting at my desk during the day,
it just feels, like, creatively stifling.

754
00:44:51,692 --> 00:44:52,860
You just have to start.

755
00:44:53,944 --> 00:44:54,945
Yeah.

756
00:44:57,614 --> 00:45:00,617
Oh. Sorry,
I just gotta handle this thing for work.

757
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:02,703
Make sure this text went through.

758
00:45:02,786 --> 00:45:05,998
We just landed another account.
It's crazy.

759
00:45:09,126 --> 00:45:14,006
You know, I'm just wondering, should we
enroll Theo in preschool this year?

760
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:17,134
Because, you know, she's on the cusp,
and I don't wanna wait too long,

761
00:45:17,217 --> 00:45:18,635
and the deadline's soon.

762
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,887
What do you think?

763
00:45:21,138 --> 00:45:22,973
Whatever. I mean, I trust you.

764
00:45:28,353 --> 00:45:29,688
Do you wanna go? It's loud.

765
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:31,315
Yeah. Yeah.

766
00:45:32,482 --> 00:45:33,483
Excuse me.

767
00:45:33,984 --> 00:45:35,319
Yeah, let's get outta here.

768
00:45:39,198 --> 00:45:40,199
The wine was good.

769
00:45:40,282 --> 00:45:41,283
Yeah?

770
00:45:41,867 --> 00:45:43,076
Dinner was good.

771
00:45:57,257 --> 00:45:59,051
- I'm sorry. Di-Did you want a cake?
- No.

772
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:01,178
I thought you hate
when they do that in restaurants.

773
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:03,055
- No, it's fine. It's fine.
- So I'm just...

774
00:46:03,138 --> 00:46:05,349
I didn't wanna embarrass you,
so I didn't get it.

775
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:06,433
No, no, no. I... It's fine.

776
00:46:06,517 --> 00:46:08,101
- If you want cake, it's really simple.
- I don't.

777
00:46:08,185 --> 00:46:11,104
- I'm gonna get you a cake. Excuse me!
- No, Dean. I don't want one.

778
00:46:55,816 --> 00:47:00,070
Okay, you have to go to sleep.
Okay? Good night.

779
00:47:00,445 --> 00:47:02,114
- I love you.
- Good night. I love you.

780
00:47:02,197 --> 00:47:03,949
- Please go to sleep.
- Okay.

781
00:47:04,032 --> 00:47:08,328
Yes? Yes? You go to sleep. Go to sleep.

782
00:47:08,412 --> 00:47:09,621
- Okay.
- Love you.

783
00:47:11,582 --> 00:47:14,293
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

784
00:47:14,376 --> 00:47:15,794
I'll just be a few hours.

785
00:47:15,878 --> 00:47:18,630
- Okay. Okay, sounds good.
- It's just a dinner thing. Okay.

786
00:47:18,714 --> 00:47:20,215
Thank you so much. Thanks.

787
00:47:25,053 --> 00:47:27,472
This is your idea of incognito?

788
00:47:27,848 --> 00:47:29,474
They'll never see us coming.

789
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:32,102
We have supplies too.

790
00:47:33,478 --> 00:47:34,563
Hop in, cutie.

791
00:47:36,648 --> 00:47:38,609
Let's make a night of it.

792
00:47:52,206 --> 00:47:54,166
- Where are we going?
- Soho House.

793
00:47:54,249 --> 00:47:57,085
- Why is he at Soho House?
- I don't know.

794
00:47:57,169 --> 00:48:00,464
So many great clubs in New York,
architecturally.

795
00:48:00,547 --> 00:48:05,302
Knickerbocker. The readings alone
at the Knickerbocker, please.

796
00:48:29,326 --> 00:48:30,619
Okay, we beat 'em.

797
00:49:06,154 --> 00:49:08,323
My guy at Claridge's got back to me.

798
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:15,414
He said that Dean went to J.Sheekey's,
where he had reserved a four-top...

799
00:49:16,957 --> 00:49:18,375
which is a good cover.

800
00:49:19,585 --> 00:49:21,795
Or maybe they just went with clients.

801
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:24,256
That's a possibility too.

802
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:25,299
I think there's a reservation.

803
00:49:25,382 --> 00:49:26,800
There they are.

804
00:49:29,178 --> 00:49:32,055
Is it the one with all the legs?

805
00:49:33,515 --> 00:49:35,434
No, I can see them from here.

806
00:49:35,517 --> 00:49:36,435
There you go.

807
00:49:36,518 --> 00:49:39,813
- Thanks. Chivalry is not dead.
- Yeah, that's Fiona.

808
00:49:40,272 --> 00:49:42,774
Did I ever tell you about
the Rockette that I dated?

809
00:49:43,984 --> 00:49:45,110
Yeah.

810
00:49:57,039 --> 00:49:58,040
Mm.

811
00:49:58,665 --> 00:49:59,833
You know...

812
00:50:02,753 --> 00:50:06,757
the Russians fed the cosmonauts beluga.

813
00:50:07,925 --> 00:50:09,134
High protein.

814
00:50:10,385 --> 00:50:15,390
Their waste was nothing but a...
slight touch of ash.

815
00:50:16,308 --> 00:50:17,643
- Really?
- Mm.

816
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:22,981
If we can call this caviar because...
there's no more beluga.

817
00:50:23,065 --> 00:50:25,984
But this is American-made,
and it's pretty good.

818
00:50:28,612 --> 00:50:31,323
Can a man ever be satisfied
with one woman?

819
00:50:31,406 --> 00:50:32,407
Come on.

820
00:50:32,908 --> 00:50:34,201
That's hardwiring.

821
00:50:34,284 --> 00:50:36,870
Keeping the species alive.

822
00:50:36,954 --> 00:50:40,165
I mean, the woman
passes through an emotional filter.

823
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:43,210
Man doesn't pass through
the emotional part.

824
00:50:43,293 --> 00:50:47,381
It goes directly from the eyes to the ass.

825
00:50:49,633 --> 00:50:51,134
And it's just that simple?

826
00:50:53,762 --> 00:50:54,930
Okay, hardwire,

827
00:50:55,013 --> 00:50:59,852
so then how does a woman
keep her desirability to a man?

828
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:01,520
Hmm.

829
00:51:02,604 --> 00:51:04,439
A woman that knows that she is.

830
00:51:05,566 --> 00:51:11,655
A woman that is confident
in her effect on you, that's sexy.

831
00:51:14,575 --> 00:51:19,580
The Corsican...
wanted me to pull her hair... hard.

832
00:51:20,372 --> 00:51:23,041
And that just wasn't me.

833
00:51:23,834 --> 00:51:24,835
The Corsican?

834
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:27,796
My God. It's Dean.

835
00:51:28,338 --> 00:51:30,257
- Okay. Just...
- What do I do? What do I do?

836
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:33,552
Take it, but be cool. Breathe.

837
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:34,761
Hey.

838
00:51:35,637 --> 00:51:36,638
- Uh...
- Cool.

839
00:51:36,722 --> 00:51:40,934
No, um, everything's... everything's fine.
I'm... I'm just about to go to sleep.

840
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:46,648
Oh... Uh, yeah. Yeah. No, that's fine.

841
00:51:47,983 --> 00:51:49,943
After midnight? Yeah, no problem.

842
00:51:50,027 --> 00:51:51,028
Okay.

843
00:51:53,947 --> 00:51:55,949
That was pretty good for your first time.

844
00:51:57,534 --> 00:52:00,746
Code red.
He's cutting her out of the herd.

845
00:52:01,538 --> 00:52:02,998
"Oh, golly goodness,

846
00:52:03,081 --> 00:52:06,293
I don't think my long legs
will fit in that cab with all of them."

847
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:13,091
Taxi!

848
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:18,972
- Good team.
- Are you coming?

849
00:52:19,056 --> 00:52:20,641
Um, okay. Scoot over.

850
00:52:21,099 --> 00:52:22,643
I can't believe this.

851
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:25,812
All right. Let's get going.

852
00:52:25,896 --> 00:52:27,606
Hang on to those eggs. Here we go.

853
00:52:30,817 --> 00:52:32,361
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

854
00:52:32,444 --> 00:52:34,613
They're trying to lose us.
It's not gonna happen.

855
00:52:34,696 --> 00:52:36,198
We've got too much horsepower!

856
00:52:36,281 --> 00:52:38,867
Whoa! You're driving crazy!

857
00:52:39,576 --> 00:52:40,953
Screw you, asshole!

858
00:52:41,036 --> 00:52:43,247
- Now, that wasn't nice. Thank you!
- Don't!

859
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:44,706
Jerk!

860
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,293
- Yeah, Jersey!
- Oh, God. Why are you driving like this?

861
00:52:48,377 --> 00:52:51,004
'Cause they're driving like this is why.
Hang on.

862
00:52:51,547 --> 00:52:52,840
Coming through!

863
00:52:52,923 --> 00:52:54,758
Uh-oh. Oh!

864
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:57,135
- You're...
- Come on. Not now. Not now.

865
00:52:57,928 --> 00:52:59,513
- Oh, my God.
- Hey. Come on, girl.

866
00:52:59,596 --> 00:53:03,725
Come on. Come on. Come on, darling.
There you go. Careful.

867
00:53:04,226 --> 00:53:06,520
- Brace yourself.
- Oh, Jesus. Dad.

868
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:07,896
Oh, nice. Nice.

869
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:08,939
Oh, my God.

870
00:53:09,022 --> 00:53:10,357
You are all in my way!

871
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,608
I'm gonna be sick.

872
00:53:11,692 --> 00:53:13,151
Lucky it's a convertible.

873
00:53:16,989 --> 00:53:19,366
- Oh! Oh.
- Come on. There you go. There you go.

874
00:53:21,994 --> 00:53:23,662
They're turning! Hang on!

875
00:53:25,664 --> 00:53:26,915
Are you trying to kill us?

876
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:29,168
He ran a red! And so did we!

877
00:53:33,046 --> 00:53:35,632
- Oops. We're gonna meet people.
- Oh, no.

878
00:53:35,716 --> 00:53:37,718
We're gonna make new friends, I'm afraid.

879
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:38,886
Sir, please pull over.

880
00:53:38,969 --> 00:53:40,179
Nothing to worry about.

881
00:53:47,186 --> 00:53:48,187
There you go.

882
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:01,116
Your license and registration, please.

883
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,035
And I'm gonna need you
to turn the engine off.

884
00:54:03,118 --> 00:54:04,661
I'm afraid I can't do that.

885
00:54:05,078 --> 00:54:06,413
Sir, turn the engine off.

886
00:54:06,496 --> 00:54:09,333
Listen. Here's the deal.
I'm stuck down here in second.

887
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:10,584
The starter's overheating.

888
00:54:10,667 --> 00:54:12,377
If I turn it off,
I'm gonna lose it, and that'll be that.

889
00:54:12,461 --> 00:54:13,962
Sir. Turn it off.

890
00:54:14,963 --> 00:54:17,966
Okay. All right. Let's say goodbye to it,
'cause it's not gonna come back.

891
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,051
That's fine.

892
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:21,178
Hear that?

893
00:54:21,762 --> 00:54:22,971
Sir, is that alcohol?

894
00:54:23,055 --> 00:54:27,809
Hell... That's '98 Krug in the car,
but it's not open. We've yet to pop it.

895
00:54:27,893 --> 00:54:29,937
Okay. Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to step out of the car.

896
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,438
Your lady friend can stay seated.

897
00:54:31,522 --> 00:54:33,357
This is like three times this week.

898
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,068
You're very funny.
I'm charmed that you said that though.

899
00:54:36,151 --> 00:54:37,945
I mean, it's kinda flattering.

900
00:54:38,028 --> 00:54:40,405
But she's not exactly my lady friend.

901
00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:43,659
This is my daughter. Laura.
Who's your guy over here?

902
00:54:43,742 --> 00:54:44,743
That's Chris.

903
00:54:44,826 --> 00:54:47,037
Chris, my daughter Laura. How you doing?

904
00:54:47,621 --> 00:54:50,290
Laura. This is, uh, Officer...

905
00:54:52,084 --> 00:54:53,961
Are you Tommy O'Callaghan's kid?

906
00:54:55,546 --> 00:54:56,588
Sir?

907
00:54:56,672 --> 00:54:57,840
Is Tommy your pop?

908
00:54:58,549 --> 00:55:00,300
Tom, yes, that's my dad.

909
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:04,930
Well, we go way back. I'm gonna call him.

910
00:55:05,013 --> 00:55:06,974
No, no, no.
Sir, please put the phone away.

911
00:55:07,516 --> 00:55:08,851
It's late. It's late.

912
00:55:08,934 --> 00:55:11,728
Yeah, it's late. I don't think my mom
would appreciate a phone call right now.

913
00:55:11,812 --> 00:55:14,398
That's right. She would brain him, not me.

914
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:15,983
Yeah.

915
00:55:16,066 --> 00:55:18,485
Well, I know your pop. That was a guy.

916
00:55:19,027 --> 00:55:22,865
I went to Sergeant O'Callaghan, Timmy...

917
00:55:22,948 --> 00:55:25,075
I went to his beefsteak
for his retirement,

918
00:55:25,158 --> 00:55:27,786
and I don't know how we got home,
to be honest with you.

919
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:29,580
That's my grandfather.

920
00:55:29,663 --> 00:55:30,998
That's right. That is correct.

921
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:32,791
Gosh, I don't know why
I didn't make you right away.

922
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:35,169
You are a ringer. Dead ringer.

923
00:55:35,252 --> 00:55:37,796
- Thank you.
- The eyes. Oh, my God.

924
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:41,800
So, you still going upstate?
Going to the Adirondacks, what?

925
00:55:41,884 --> 00:55:43,510
We... Well, when we can.

926
00:55:43,594 --> 00:55:44,636
- Yeah?
- Um...

927
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,305
And you got kids of your own?

928
00:55:46,972 --> 00:55:49,266
- We're trying. Yeah.
- Attaboy. Attaboy.

929
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:50,976
It's the trying
that's so much fun, isn't it?

930
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:52,978
Yeah, isn't it?

931
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:54,938
Well, it's good to see ya, man.
Really good to see ya.

932
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:56,523
Nice to meet you, sir. Good to meet you.

933
00:55:56,607 --> 00:55:58,400
And actually,
we could get you on your way,

934
00:55:58,483 --> 00:56:00,444
if you could be a little more careful
from now on, please.

935
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:02,613
No, I was being careful,
that's why I ran the light,

936
00:56:02,696 --> 00:56:04,823
'cause I didn't wanna get stuck
in the intersection.

937
00:56:04,907 --> 00:56:05,741
That's all right.

938
00:56:05,824 --> 00:56:07,284
Hey, I need a little manpower.

939
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:09,745
We need some beef. You only gotta
get it going about ten miles an hour.

940
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:10,829
Okay.

941
00:56:10,913 --> 00:56:13,081
- It'll pop pretty easily in second.
- We're just gonna give him a push.

942
00:56:13,165 --> 00:56:14,374
I'll just pop it.

943
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:16,710
- Thanks. Let me get the keys in.
- You in?

944
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:17,961
Yeah, I'm in. Thanks.

945
00:56:19,338 --> 00:56:21,965
It must be very nice to be you.

946
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:24,927
I wouldn't have it any other way.

947
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:27,429
All right. On your mark. Get set. Go.

948
00:56:33,268 --> 00:56:36,980
New York's finest! Thanks, fellas.
Whoo-hoo!

949
00:57:00,546 --> 00:57:01,547
Felix?

950
00:57:03,423 --> 00:57:04,591
Hey.

951
00:57:07,427 --> 00:57:09,221
Wow, you look great.

952
00:57:09,304 --> 00:57:10,722
You look better.

953
00:57:11,932 --> 00:57:13,934
Yeah? Well, I'm with my daughter.

954
00:57:15,102 --> 00:57:16,103
Oh.

955
00:57:16,186 --> 00:57:17,479
Hi.

956
00:57:17,563 --> 00:57:18,564
Hey.

957
00:57:20,691 --> 00:57:23,026
I, uh, may be ready to sell the Hockney.

958
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:26,738
Oh, you know how to get to me.

959
00:57:26,822 --> 00:57:28,198
You know where to call me.

960
00:57:28,282 --> 00:57:29,700
I keep funny hours.

961
00:57:29,783 --> 00:57:32,369
I remember.

962
00:57:42,296 --> 00:57:44,256
- It's a client.
- Mm-hmm.

963
00:57:52,222 --> 00:57:53,807
I think I'm going deaf.

964
00:57:55,434 --> 00:57:57,477
Really?

965
00:57:57,561 --> 00:58:01,940
I can hear everything fine,
except women's voices.

966
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,819
You can't go deaf just to women.

967
00:58:07,738 --> 00:58:08,989
It's the pitch.

968
00:58:14,036 --> 00:58:15,829
We're making some good progress.

969
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,332
This is pathetic.

970
00:58:20,042 --> 00:58:22,169
We just need to get some more information.

971
00:58:24,254 --> 00:58:26,924
Maybe he's just not
interested in me anymore.

972
00:58:29,801 --> 00:58:30,844
Impossible.

973
00:58:32,846 --> 00:58:33,889
Thanks.

974
00:58:46,985 --> 00:58:48,820
You're gonna be all right, shorty.

975
00:59:28,861 --> 00:59:30,737
Turns out he was married.

976
00:59:31,196 --> 00:59:33,323
- I'm so sorry.
- Mm.

977
00:59:33,407 --> 00:59:38,996
I know.
It's such a strange bummer.

978
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:43,876
And, um... And you know what?
Like, I have things to do.

979
00:59:44,585 --> 00:59:46,795
You know what I mean? I don't really
have time for other people's baggage.

980
00:59:46,879 --> 00:59:48,964
I'm sort of like, "Okay."

981
00:59:49,339 --> 00:59:53,218
Like, get on down the road if that's
sort of what you're gonna be like,

982
00:59:53,302 --> 00:59:55,137
- especially in our community.
- Sure. Sure.

983
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:56,221
Which I think is like...

984
00:59:56,305 --> 00:59:58,765
Okay, I mean, he's basically
walking around with, like, a mask on,

985
00:59:58,849 --> 01:00:01,977
whereas I'm, like, so... open.

986
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:06,690
- Yeah.
- I'm just, like, bare. Like, I'm naked.

987
01:00:07,733 --> 01:00:10,736
And I was...
You know, I was there with him naked.

988
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:13,447
You would think two people naked together,
like, one of them might say,

989
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:16,325
"Oh, by the way, like,
I have a wife and a family,

990
01:00:16,408 --> 01:00:19,119
and we own a home together, and we,
like, all sleep in the same house...

991
01:00:19,203 --> 01:00:20,954
...and use the same bathrooms, and we...

992
01:00:21,038 --> 01:00:24,458
have a family, and you're not in it
because you're not even my girlfriend.

993
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:25,918
Because I have a wife."

994
01:00:27,544 --> 01:00:29,296
Okay, what's so important?

995
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:33,383
Well, it's just a start.

996
01:00:37,137 --> 01:00:38,889
Oh, my God.

997
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:40,140
What...

998
01:00:40,224 --> 01:00:41,975
- This is nothing.
- Laura.

999
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:47,481
My God. What if what we find out is
that Dean's just busy, and I'm in a rut?

1000
01:00:47,564 --> 01:00:48,565
That's it.

1001
01:00:48,649 --> 01:00:51,735
God,
I regret telling you anything.

1002
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:54,071
I talked to my man at Bones.

1003
01:00:54,154 --> 01:00:58,367
Bo...
No, enough with the spy scenarios, okay?

1004
01:00:59,368 --> 01:01:04,540
Did you really call me in here to show me
pictures of my husband eating a sandwich?

1005
01:01:04,623 --> 01:01:07,960
There's more. We put a hotwatch on him.

1006
01:01:10,212 --> 01:01:11,296
What's a hotwatch?

1007
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:15,133
They track his credit cards
and his whereabouts.

1008
01:01:15,634 --> 01:01:17,052
Okay, and?

1009
01:01:22,516 --> 01:01:24,935
May be nothing, but...

1010
01:01:26,311 --> 01:01:27,354
What?

1011
01:01:32,943 --> 01:01:34,736
He booked a trip to Manzanillo.

1012
01:01:36,238 --> 01:01:38,156
You are so full of it.

1013
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,659
He would tell me
if he was going to Mexico.

1014
01:01:42,995 --> 01:01:45,414
We need to gather and evaluate.

1015
01:01:46,456 --> 01:01:47,666
I have to get going.

1016
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:50,752
Wait, I can drop you. Quick stop.

1017
01:01:51,378 --> 01:01:53,755
- No, I...
- Mrs. Morris at the Sherry. It's her 90th.

1018
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:55,215
I have to get home.

1019
01:01:55,299 --> 01:01:57,509
Fast elevators, and she's got a Twombly.

1020
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,601
She did the Venice Biennale.

1021
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:09,396
With Storm King,
she's doing something so beautiful.

1022
01:02:10,022 --> 01:02:15,027
It's... It's beyond description.
It's a crescent. It's called Fallen Sky.

1023
01:02:15,444 --> 01:02:19,031
Made of stainless steel,
and you have the reflection.

1024
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:22,993
And at Storm King, you know,
all these grotesque big things...

1025
01:02:24,161 --> 01:02:25,829
Are you Felix's daughter?

1026
01:02:26,163 --> 01:02:27,581
Yes, I'm Laura.

1027
01:02:27,998 --> 01:02:29,416
You live in the city?

1028
01:02:29,499 --> 01:02:30,501
I do.

1029
01:02:30,959 --> 01:02:32,294
Are you married?

1030
01:02:33,128 --> 01:02:34,254
Yes, I am.

1031
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:35,797
How is it?

1032
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:40,135
Honestly, I'm not sure right now.

1033
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:43,138
And that was very entertaining.

1034
01:02:43,222 --> 01:02:49,228
She makes rocks, huge ones, small ones,
but they're as light as a feather.

1035
01:02:50,896 --> 01:02:54,566
You know what I think?
Marriage is like a bank account.

1036
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,903
You make deposits
for the first 20 or 30 years,

1037
01:02:57,986 --> 01:03:02,366
and then, after that,
you have all this interest built up,

1038
01:03:02,449 --> 01:03:05,202
and you can start making withdrawals.

1039
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:10,249
And... I don't forget costumes.

1040
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:12,793
Oh.

1041
01:03:17,256 --> 01:03:18,340
So nice to meet you.

1042
01:03:19,299 --> 01:03:20,384
Same here.

1043
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:28,642
- I'm dying for that Twombly.
- Mm.

1044
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:32,521
She looks pretty healthy to me.
She might make it to 100.

1045
01:03:33,564 --> 01:03:35,899
All right.
Don't get my blood pressure up, shorty.

1046
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:37,776
All right,
I wanna show you something special.

1047
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:40,696
But you have to walk backwards
so no one knows we're leaving.

1048
01:03:52,749 --> 01:03:54,293
Where are we going?

1049
01:03:54,376 --> 01:03:55,669
Hey! Where are we...

1050
01:04:09,433 --> 01:04:10,976
That's something, isn't it?

1051
01:04:11,852 --> 01:04:12,978
Beautiful.

1052
01:04:16,315 --> 01:04:19,109
I remember the first time I saw them
at the Tuileries.

1053
01:04:21,111 --> 01:04:24,656
The next day, your mom and I
drove out to the gardens at Giverny.

1054
01:05:46,154 --> 01:05:47,239
- Hey.
- Hey.

1055
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,742
How's writing going?

1056
01:05:51,743 --> 01:05:55,789
Ugh,
I wish I had something exciting to report.

1057
01:05:55,873 --> 01:05:58,834
I just... I'm so stuck.

1058
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:01,670
I keep telling you...

1059
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,965
you have to make more time for yourself.

1060
01:06:05,757 --> 01:06:08,927
Yeah, right. Like... take a trip.

1061
01:06:09,011 --> 01:06:11,930
- Yeah.
- By myself.

1062
01:06:12,014 --> 01:06:13,557
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

1063
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:16,226
I got invited to a conference
down in Mexico.

1064
01:06:17,186 --> 01:06:19,646
It's kinda last minute,
but it's a really big deal.

1065
01:06:22,191 --> 01:06:23,442
Who... Who's going?

1066
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:26,987
Just the team, you know.
Me, John, Fifi, Rog...

1067
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:28,071
Fiona?

1068
01:06:28,989 --> 01:06:30,282
Yeah. Fifi.

1069
01:06:31,825 --> 01:06:32,826
Right.

1070
01:06:38,415 --> 01:06:41,627
All right. I'm going to bed.

1071
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:44,171
Love you.

1072
01:06:48,383 --> 01:06:51,929
Your Bones man was right.
They're headed to Mexico.

1073
01:06:52,304 --> 01:06:53,305
I told you.

1074
01:06:53,388 --> 01:06:55,516
All right, pack your bags. Call a sitter.

1075
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:57,017
I'll arrange everything else.

1076
01:06:57,768 --> 01:07:02,231
Are you crazy? I'm not gonna leave
my kids for a few days with a babysitter.

1077
01:07:02,648 --> 01:07:03,857
Call your mother.

1078
01:07:04,358 --> 01:07:05,984
We're not just gonna hop...

1079
01:07:06,443 --> 01:07:07,444
You know what?

1080
01:07:07,528 --> 01:07:09,780
I'm just gonna talk to him.
I'm just gonna talk to him.

1081
01:07:09,863 --> 01:07:11,323
I don't advise that.

1082
01:07:11,865 --> 01:07:14,409
Look, you need to get ahead of this thing.

1083
01:07:15,244 --> 01:07:16,995
It's only a few hours away.

1084
01:07:17,704 --> 01:07:21,834
My friend's condo,
at the resort next door, is available.

1085
01:07:21,917 --> 01:07:23,585
Got its own private entrance.

1086
01:07:23,669 --> 01:07:25,838
And you deserve a little vacation.

1087
01:07:25,921 --> 01:07:27,256
No way.

1088
01:07:27,339 --> 01:07:28,674
Pack light.

1089
01:07:37,057 --> 01:07:39,184
I got a map of the properties
from my travel agent.

1090
01:07:39,268 --> 01:07:41,103
Who has a travel agent anymore?

1091
01:07:41,186 --> 01:07:43,730
Their group is staying
at this place right over here.

1092
01:07:44,231 --> 01:07:47,150
What do you say
we meet at the bar in, say, 45?

1093
01:10:01,243 --> 01:10:03,996
- Gabi, Laura. Laura, Gabi.
- Hi.

1094
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:05,664
- My yoga instructor.
- Hi.

1095
01:10:05,747 --> 01:10:07,124
- Charro.
- Hi.

1096
01:10:07,207 --> 01:10:09,293
- Alejandro. Juan.
- Hi.

1097
01:10:09,835 --> 01:10:10,961
This fella I didn't meet.

1098
01:10:11,044 --> 01:10:14,339
Do you really have to make such
a big entrance everywhere you go?

1099
01:10:14,423 --> 01:10:15,674
That was an exit.

1100
01:10:15,757 --> 01:10:17,634
But if I do go missing,
check the yoga studio.

1101
01:10:17,718 --> 01:10:18,927
Just don't break anything.

1102
01:10:19,011 --> 01:10:20,262
- Hi.
- Hey.

1103
01:10:20,345 --> 01:10:22,055
Carla.

1104
01:10:22,681 --> 01:10:24,391
- Carla. This is her place.
- Welcome.

1105
01:10:24,474 --> 01:10:25,851
It's so nice.

1106
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:26,935
Enjoy it.

1107
01:10:27,603 --> 01:10:29,855
- And I'll think about the Hockney.
- Thank you.

1108
01:10:30,397 --> 01:10:33,108
Wait. Is that why we're here?
Because you're making a deal?

1109
01:10:33,192 --> 01:10:35,235
No. We're here 'cause we're here.

1110
01:10:35,319 --> 01:10:36,361
She just might be someone

1111
01:10:36,445 --> 01:10:38,989
who could be interested
in a very expensive piece of art.

1112
01:10:42,868 --> 01:10:44,411
I can't believe I'm here.

1113
01:10:45,537 --> 01:10:47,539
It's beautiful. Isn't it?

1114
01:10:48,665 --> 01:10:49,666
It is.

1115
01:10:54,796 --> 01:10:57,716
Do you know there's a cult up in Canada

1116
01:10:58,425 --> 01:11:00,928
where women kidnap innocent men,

1117
01:11:01,428 --> 01:11:04,431
and if they try to escape or resist
in any way,

1118
01:11:05,224 --> 01:11:07,768
the women placate them with sex.

1119
01:11:08,185 --> 01:11:09,728
It sounds like your fantasy.

1120
01:11:10,229 --> 01:11:11,730
It's not unlike the bonobos.

1121
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:14,816
- You know who they are.
- The monkeys?

1122
01:11:15,442 --> 01:11:19,112
Only mammals
where the females dominate the males.

1123
01:11:21,907 --> 01:11:25,160
Why is it that when a woman has an affair,

1124
01:11:25,244 --> 01:11:28,372
it's so wonderful that she found someone?

1125
01:11:28,455 --> 01:11:32,209
But if a man has an affair,
he's banging his secretary?

1126
01:11:34,336 --> 01:11:35,462
Why did you do it?

1127
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:48,350
When your mom and I were first together,
she was so amazing.

1128
01:11:48,433 --> 01:11:51,436
I mean, she shone all her light on me.

1129
01:11:52,771 --> 01:11:56,233
But when you guys came along,
all that light went to you two.

1130
01:11:57,401 --> 01:12:00,279
And when someone
looked at me again like that...

1131
01:12:02,573 --> 01:12:04,491
you know, I wanted that glow again.

1132
01:12:05,868 --> 01:12:07,619
You're such a baby.

1133
01:12:10,455 --> 01:12:12,457
We all just want to be loved.

1134
01:12:12,958 --> 01:12:14,251
It's exhausting.

1135
01:12:16,628 --> 01:12:17,629
Why?

1136
01:12:19,006 --> 01:12:21,842
It's exhausting to try to love you enough.

1137
01:12:24,219 --> 01:12:28,432
Your mother had all these things
she wanted to do all of a sudden.

1138
01:12:28,515 --> 01:12:30,517
And all her friends.

1139
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:31,685
And she had you kids.

1140
01:12:32,352 --> 01:12:35,522
You know, when Holly came along
and was so crazy about me,

1141
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:37,858
I wasn't used to it.

1142
01:12:37,941 --> 01:12:40,068
So that's all it took?

1143
01:12:40,152 --> 01:12:44,489
That was the appeal? That she just
looked at you with such adoration?

1144
01:12:45,574 --> 01:12:49,536
Yeah, and your mom
didn't wanna travel with me anymore.

1145
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:52,122
I needed to travel. She wouldn't go.

1146
01:12:52,206 --> 01:12:54,499
She suggested I take Holly.

1147
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:56,293
Holly had just started at the gallery.

1148
01:12:59,129 --> 01:13:00,964
Did you know that she died this year?

1149
01:13:04,676 --> 01:13:06,428
- No.
- She died.

1150
01:13:08,889 --> 01:13:10,891
I never thought I'd outlive her.

1151
01:13:13,268 --> 01:13:14,478
She was only...

1152
01:13:15,437 --> 01:13:16,438
50.

1153
01:13:17,898 --> 01:13:19,858
I don't really remember her.

1154
01:13:21,652 --> 01:13:22,861
She was funny...

1155
01:13:25,322 --> 01:13:26,615
and very smart...

1156
01:13:29,576 --> 01:13:31,453
and a terrifically talented painter.

1157
01:13:39,294 --> 01:13:40,963
I never got to say goodbye to her.

1158
01:13:42,923 --> 01:13:46,051
After everything you put us through,
what it did to Mom,

1159
01:13:46,969 --> 01:13:49,054
and then you didn't even stay with Holly.

1160
01:13:50,097 --> 01:13:51,431
Was it worth it?

1161
01:13:56,603 --> 01:13:57,771
It was heartbreaking...

1162
01:13:59,815 --> 01:14:00,983
for everyone.

1163
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:22,171
Do you know where we are?

1164
01:14:22,254 --> 01:14:24,423
All right.
We're gonna cut between these two.

1165
01:14:26,341 --> 01:14:28,468
Uh-oh. Come here.
Move it. Move it. Move it.

1166
01:14:28,552 --> 01:14:29,636
Dig, dig.

1167
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,930
- Get down. Get down. Get down.
- Okay, okay! All right!

1168
01:14:32,014 --> 01:14:34,892
No. Too late.
Stand up. Stand up. Stand up.

1169
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:37,186
- Put your arms around me.
- What? Ew.

1170
01:14:38,437 --> 01:14:39,438
Gross.

1171
01:14:40,063 --> 01:14:44,067
- Mm-hmm.
- Yuck. That is truly a new low.

1172
01:14:44,943 --> 01:14:47,321
Hey, you're welcome. It was effective.

1173
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:49,072
This is wartime.

1174
01:14:49,406 --> 01:14:50,449
Where are we going?

1175
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:54,286
Mr. Wonderful's room is right over there.

1176
01:14:54,369 --> 01:14:55,370
You sure?

1177
01:14:55,454 --> 01:14:58,165
If you can hold some of this... here.

1178
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:00,667
Can hold these.

1179
01:15:02,169 --> 01:15:03,420
Don't crush those.

1180
01:15:08,592 --> 01:15:10,093
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1181
01:15:10,177 --> 01:15:12,012
Can you hold these, please?

1182
01:15:12,095 --> 01:15:13,096
Yeah.

1183
01:15:18,477 --> 01:15:19,478
Where now?

1184
01:15:22,689 --> 01:15:23,815
Are you okay?

1185
01:15:23,899 --> 01:15:25,400
I'm doing great. I'm on fire.

1186
01:15:25,484 --> 01:15:26,485
Let's go.

1187
01:15:29,988 --> 01:15:33,367
I never got the point of infinity pools.

1188
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:35,619
Where the hell is the edge?
You don't even know.

1189
01:15:35,702 --> 01:15:37,746
The damn thing makes me afraid

1190
01:15:37,829 --> 01:15:40,666
that I'm gonna fall off
into some canyon or something.

1191
01:15:41,124 --> 01:15:42,209
Just... Shh.

1192
01:15:42,292 --> 01:15:44,962
- Wait a second.
- What? What do you see?

1193
01:15:46,004 --> 01:15:47,381
There's a woman in the room.

1194
01:15:48,841 --> 01:15:50,759
What? You sure?

1195
01:15:52,469 --> 01:15:53,470
I'm sure.

1196
01:15:59,643 --> 01:16:02,020
- Hey. Where you going?
- I can't believe this.

1197
01:16:02,104 --> 01:16:03,355
Wait. Wait!

1198
01:16:03,438 --> 01:16:05,148
I'm ending this shit right now.

1199
01:16:05,232 --> 01:16:06,441
Oh, wait. Don't do that.

1200
01:16:06,525 --> 01:16:07,818
- Where is he?
- Wait up.

1201
01:16:08,527 --> 01:16:09,570
Wait up. Wait up.

1202
01:16:11,822 --> 01:16:13,991
Just a second. This is a bad idea.

1203
01:16:14,074 --> 01:16:15,659
This is your bad idea.

1204
01:16:16,827 --> 01:16:18,412
And that's bad too. Silence that.

1205
01:16:18,495 --> 01:16:20,163
- You silence it. It's not mine.
- Shut it up.

1206
01:16:20,247 --> 01:16:22,165
- It's not mine. It's not my ring.
- It's not...

1207
01:16:22,249 --> 01:16:26,128
It's my ring, but you... you have my phone.
Where's my phone? Where is it?

1208
01:16:26,211 --> 01:16:28,005
- Grabbing isn't helping.
- Where is it?

1209
01:16:29,298 --> 01:16:30,883
Where's my phone? Ugh.

1210
01:16:35,095 --> 01:16:37,222
Give it to me. Come on! Give it...

1211
01:16:38,223 --> 01:16:39,725
- No, Dad.
- It's for you.

1212
01:16:39,808 --> 01:16:42,227
It's for you. I wanna talk to this guy.

1213
01:16:44,855 --> 01:16:45,856
Laura?

1214
01:16:45,939 --> 01:16:49,067
Oh, my God! What...

1215
01:16:50,068 --> 01:16:51,862
Fiona? What...

1216
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:56,241
Do you need to get that?

1217
01:16:57,826 --> 01:16:59,995
One... second.

1218
01:17:00,078 --> 01:17:01,997
- Hey.
- Hey. What's up?

1219
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,750
- Uh...
- How you doing, baby? Guess what?

1220
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:07,711
I'm coming home.

1221
01:17:07,794 --> 01:17:09,880
I got done early,
so I caught a flight home.

1222
01:17:09,963 --> 01:17:11,882
- I'm on my way.
- What? When?

1223
01:17:12,299 --> 01:17:13,926
I should be there in a half hour.

1224
01:17:14,259 --> 01:17:16,762
So, you wanna order some Chinese?

1225
01:17:17,304 --> 01:17:19,556
- Maybe crack a bottle of wine?
- Uh...

1226
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:22,601
Well, I... I'm not home.
My... My mom is with them.

1227
01:17:23,227 --> 01:17:24,353
So, uh...

1228
01:17:24,436 --> 01:17:25,437
Where are you?

1229
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:28,148
Well, I can't wait to see you.

1230
01:17:28,232 --> 01:17:30,192
- I love you. See you soon.
- I'll call you later.

1231
01:17:30,275 --> 01:17:32,069
Were you trying to surprise Dean?

1232
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:33,487
Sort of, yeah.

1233
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:36,365
Oh, that's so romantic. Oh.

1234
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:40,035
- Hi.
- Hi.

1235
01:17:41,245 --> 01:17:42,246
Oh, gosh.

1236
01:17:42,329 --> 01:17:45,457
Um... is... is he with you?

1237
01:17:49,586 --> 01:17:51,672
Yes. That... That's my dad.

1238
01:17:52,256 --> 01:17:53,465
Come say hi, Dad.

1239
01:17:53,549 --> 01:17:54,591
Hi.

1240
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:56,051
Felix Keane.

1241
01:17:56,134 --> 01:17:58,554
Fiona Saunders. Nice to meet you.

1242
01:17:58,971 --> 01:18:00,138
And this is my friend Mandy.

1243
01:18:00,889 --> 01:18:02,057
- Hi.
- Hi.

1244
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:04,852
So, Dean gave us his room.

1245
01:18:04,935 --> 01:18:07,187
It's so nice, the ocean view, and just...

1246
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:09,398
Do you wanna come in and have a drink?

1247
01:18:09,481 --> 01:18:11,483
- One drink.
- That's very nice, but no. No.

1248
01:18:11,567 --> 01:18:13,068
We're... Thank you.

1249
01:18:13,151 --> 01:18:14,695
Thank you. No, we're gonna go.

1250
01:18:14,778 --> 01:18:16,113
- Okay.
- Good to see you.

1251
01:18:16,905 --> 01:18:19,575
Bye.

1252
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:42,806
You can slow down.
There's a storm coming.

1253
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:45,267
I know. I just gotta get outta here.

1254
01:18:45,809 --> 01:18:47,227
How could you bring me here?

1255
01:18:48,395 --> 01:18:49,980
Hey. I'm on your side.

1256
01:18:50,063 --> 01:18:54,067
I was such an idiot to let you
convince me to come here.

1257
01:18:54,943 --> 01:18:58,238
You blew your own marriage,
and now you're gonna mess up mine?

1258
01:18:58,322 --> 01:19:00,032
Can you let anybody be happy?

1259
01:19:00,616 --> 01:19:02,743
You are so selfish.

1260
01:19:05,746 --> 01:19:07,497
You can say it to my face now.

1261
01:19:08,207 --> 01:19:09,333
I will.

1262
01:19:10,626 --> 01:19:15,214
I am sick of you taking over everything,

1263
01:19:15,881 --> 01:19:18,842
making it all about you
and what you want all the time.

1264
01:19:20,177 --> 01:19:21,929
What you dragged us all through.

1265
01:19:22,012 --> 01:19:23,597
You pushed Mom away.

1266
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:29,228
You can't go deaf to women's voices.
You know that, right?

1267
01:19:30,562 --> 01:19:32,439
You have daughters and granddaughters,

1268
01:19:32,523 --> 01:19:34,942
so you better start figuring out
how to hear them.

1269
01:19:36,109 --> 01:19:37,236
You pushed Mom away.

1270
01:19:38,362 --> 01:19:39,821
You wanna push us away too?

1271
01:19:40,948 --> 01:19:43,200
It's shocking that as your daughter,

1272
01:19:43,283 --> 01:19:47,120
I'm capable of having
any kind of relationship at all

1273
01:19:47,204 --> 01:19:49,456
with anybody, with anyone respectful.

1274
01:19:50,582 --> 01:19:52,084
You weren't even discreet.

1275
01:19:53,001 --> 01:19:56,880
You couldn't even just be discreet
out of respect for Mom?

1276
01:19:57,923 --> 01:19:58,924
And me?

1277
01:19:59,758 --> 01:20:04,221
Do you know what it's like
to have to keep all of your secrets?

1278
01:20:05,013 --> 01:20:06,014
Ugh.

1279
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:08,141
Stupid theories.

1280
01:20:08,851 --> 01:20:11,728
You are not an animal
with no self-control.

1281
01:20:12,229 --> 01:20:14,648
You can control your own behavior.

1282
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,988
And can you be around a woman
without hitting on her?

1283
01:20:22,197 --> 01:20:24,074
Because it's starting to get pathetic.

1284
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,579
What happened to you?

1285
01:20:30,122 --> 01:20:31,456
You used to be fun.

1286
01:20:43,802 --> 01:20:47,139
Maybe something changed.
Just... Can you please check? Any flight.

1287
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:49,141
Tomorrow morning?

1288
01:20:50,475 --> 01:20:51,476
Please.

1289
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:54,021
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Those flights have been canceled.

1290
01:20:54,104 --> 01:20:55,731
You can try going on standby.

1291
01:22:02,256 --> 01:22:06,134
Ladies and gentlemen,
please check updated flight information

1292
01:22:06,218 --> 01:22:08,971
because there are
multiple delays and cancellations.

1293
01:22:09,054 --> 01:22:10,222
Thank you.

1294
01:22:24,778 --> 01:22:25,863
Hi.

1295
01:22:25,946 --> 01:22:27,072
- Mommy!
- Mama!

1296
01:22:27,573 --> 01:22:28,740
Hi!

1297
01:22:29,533 --> 01:22:30,826
- You made it.
- Thanks, Mom.

1298
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:36,164
Come on, girls. No, no. Let's go to bed.

1299
01:22:36,248 --> 01:22:37,875
I don't wanna go to bed.

1300
01:22:47,301 --> 01:22:48,844
Can we talk outside?

1301
01:23:09,948 --> 01:23:10,949
All right.

1302
01:23:11,575 --> 01:23:14,244
What are you thinking? What was that? Hmm?

1303
01:23:14,328 --> 01:23:16,330
I... My dad...

1304
01:23:17,539 --> 01:23:19,791
You know, one of his crazy ideas.

1305
01:23:21,001 --> 01:23:24,129
He thought it was a good idea
to follow you to Mexico...

1306
01:23:25,589 --> 01:23:29,843
and if something was going on,
I could... I could get ahead of it.

1307
01:23:29,927 --> 01:23:32,679
- Why didn't you just ask me?
- I don't... I don't know.

1308
01:23:32,763 --> 01:23:35,224
I know I... I should have. I should have.

1309
01:23:36,266 --> 01:23:37,476
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

1310
01:23:38,810 --> 01:23:39,853
I just, um...

1311
01:23:42,731 --> 01:23:45,526
I'm just not myself right now, and...

1312
01:23:47,027 --> 01:23:48,529
I can't write,

1313
01:23:49,154 --> 01:23:52,491
and I just feel like
you're not that into me.

1314
01:23:52,574 --> 01:23:55,577
- Babe...
- And I... feel so boring.

1315
01:23:56,036 --> 01:23:58,372
Hey. You are not boring.

1316
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:03,752
Okay. Maybe a little bit.

1317
01:24:07,297 --> 01:24:09,174
I don't wanna be with anybody else.

1318
01:24:09,258 --> 01:24:12,553
But it seems like you were
everywhere else except with me.

1319
01:24:12,636 --> 01:24:13,637
I was working.

1320
01:24:16,515 --> 01:24:18,892
All right. You know what? I'm sorry.

1321
01:24:20,394 --> 01:24:23,313
I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I did anything
to make you feel that way.

1322
01:24:23,397 --> 01:24:25,524
And I'm sorry I haven't been around more.

1323
01:24:26,733 --> 01:24:28,694
I'm just trying to
make this company successful.

1324
01:24:28,777 --> 01:24:30,028
I'm trying to impress you.

1325
01:24:30,112 --> 01:24:31,738
- Impress me?
- I just...

1326
01:24:31,822 --> 01:24:33,490
You don't have to impress me.

1327
01:24:34,825 --> 01:24:36,368
I just wanna be enough for you.

1328
01:24:37,411 --> 01:24:39,413
You do?

1329
01:24:39,496 --> 01:24:41,748
- Enough for them.
- You are.

1330
01:24:42,332 --> 01:24:43,250
I'm so...

1331
01:24:44,334 --> 01:24:45,878
I'm so sorry.

1332
01:24:47,504 --> 01:24:48,630
I'm sorry.

1333
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:54,511
I'm so stupid. It was stupid.

1334
01:24:54,595 --> 01:24:55,596
Stupid as hell.

1335
01:24:58,265 --> 01:24:59,850
- I love you.
- I love you.

1336
01:25:00,684 --> 01:25:01,685
So much.

1337
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:05,731
Let's go home.

1338
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:11,778
I can't believe you went
all the way to Mexico.

1339
01:25:11,862 --> 01:25:13,530
Trust me, it was not a vacation.

1340
01:25:13,614 --> 01:25:16,491
You're such a stalker.

1341
01:25:55,239 --> 01:25:57,157
Do you want some pancakes?

1342
01:25:57,241 --> 01:25:58,242
No.

1343
01:25:59,576 --> 01:26:00,577
Let me sleep.

1344
01:26:18,303 --> 01:26:19,304
You got it.

1345
01:26:21,056 --> 01:26:23,934
Very nice. You're great.

1346
01:26:25,561 --> 01:26:28,230
Well, we got to the bottom of things. Huh?

1347
01:26:30,774 --> 01:26:33,277
And I may have made a few mistakes.

1348
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:39,283
Next time just ask me
if you wanna spend some time together.

1349
01:26:40,367 --> 01:26:42,369
Okay, I do. How about this?

1350
01:26:42,452 --> 01:26:47,249
The QE2 leaves at 5:00.
You could still make it.

1351
01:26:47,332 --> 01:26:49,084
I have the Princess Margaret suite.

1352
01:26:49,168 --> 01:26:52,296
A little bit, uh, floral, but very nice.

1353
01:26:52,379 --> 01:26:54,339
All-you-can-eat, all-you-can-drink,

1354
01:26:54,423 --> 01:26:58,552
and it's a known fact that you can drink
a lot more on a ship in the open ocean.

1355
01:26:58,635 --> 01:27:00,345
We could just get aboard,

1356
01:27:00,429 --> 01:27:03,098
see how much we could handle
without falling overboard.

1357
01:27:04,892 --> 01:27:07,811
Sounds fun, but I can't.

1358
01:27:10,439 --> 01:27:12,191
You have your own adventure.

1359
01:27:19,031 --> 01:27:20,282
I'll see you soon, kiddo.

1360
01:27:32,544 --> 01:27:33,629
Bye, Dad.

1361
01:27:37,049 --> 01:27:38,175
Bye.

1362
01:27:54,733 --> 01:27:58,862
So, how's the writing going?
How many pages you do today?

1363
01:27:58,946 --> 01:28:00,781
I am on page 64.

1364
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:02,366
- Nice.
- Mm-hmm.

1365
01:28:02,783 --> 01:28:04,868
I just don't really know where to go next.

1366
01:28:04,952 --> 01:28:07,538
Ah, you'll get through it.

1367
01:28:07,621 --> 01:28:10,499
At least we know you could write
a really good detective story.

1368
01:28:10,582 --> 01:28:12,459
Ha ha.

1369
01:28:12,543 --> 01:28:15,546
Or not so good.

1370
01:28:15,629 --> 01:28:17,089
I can't believe you.

1371
01:28:18,924 --> 01:28:19,925
Here.

1372
01:28:22,302 --> 01:28:23,762
I got you a little something.

1373
01:28:24,263 --> 01:28:26,181
It's the rest of your birthday present.

1374
01:28:30,936 --> 01:28:31,937
Hope you like it.

1375
01:29:05,429 --> 01:29:08,265
Sorry, I didn't realize
how long it takes to engrave.

1376
01:29:26,617 --> 01:29:27,743
It's beautiful.

1377
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:29,411
Like you.

1378
01:29:39,963 --> 01:29:41,507
It looks really nice on your wrist.

1379
01:29:52,559 --> 01:29:53,810
Looks great.

1380
01:29:53,894 --> 01:29:54,853
Hmm. Love it.

1381
01:29:55,938 --> 01:29:56,939
Thank you.

1382
01:29:58,190 --> 01:29:59,650
Happy birthday, my love.

1383
01:29:59,733 --> 01:30:01,026
Thank you.

1383
01:30:02,305 --> 01:31:02,155
